[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:27.769]  ...remarkable fall truckload sale going on right now that gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you... ...will it be Globalist Puppet A or Puppet B?
[00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:36.420]  Yeah.
[00:01:05.538 --> 00:01:09.282]  We're going to be left with a choice of a lesser of two evils.
[00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:17.131]  They continue to vote for these Democrats and Republicans, the people that are wrecking our country, and yet they still vote for them!
[00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:31.189]  Unlike North Korea and China, we Americans have the illusion of choice this November 6th.
[00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.250]  Will it be Globalist Puppet A or Puppet B?
[00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:36.391]  I think that a lot of votes are going to be stolen.
[00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:41.733]  By the millions, in fact, I can give you a pretty solid number, about at least 5.9 million.
[00:01:42.113 --> 00:01:45.594]  Because I'm a statistician, I work from the government's raw data.
[00:01:45.614 --> 00:01:47.795]  About 5.9 million votes are going to go kapoof.
[00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:53.937]  I don't know how you could possibly have voter fraud when your son owns the voting machines.
[00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:55.798]  Tune in to the live video streams at
[00:01:56.218 --> 00:02:07.952]  Alex Jones will be live with some great special guests to cover what is in store for our country as we march into the arms of the new world order.
[00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:14.420]  And tune in Wednesday for more live pre-stream election fallout coverage from 7pm to 9pm Central.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.902]  Coke or Pepsi, Romney or Obama?
[00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:22.383]  The choice is not up to you.
[00:02:22.883 --> 00:02:25.945]  So join us as we talk about the real issues facing our country.
[00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:36.053]  Guests will include Gerald Salenti, Wayne Madsen, Max Keiser, Paul Craig Roberts, Lou Rockwell, Nomi Prins, and Webster Tarpley.
[00:02:36.653 --> 00:02:40.697]  We'll have live sheeple updates from polling centers and political parties around Austin.
[00:02:41.903 --> 00:02:46.306]  Which management team from Slavery Incorporated will run the country into oblivion for the next four years?
[00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:54.211]  Tune in to Infowars.com or Prison Planet TV this Tuesday, November 6th, and Wednesday, November 7th, as another meaningless pageant is played out.
[00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:55.872]  The streams will be free.
[00:02:56.432 --> 00:02:59.935]  So, send a link below to all your friends on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:03:10.652 --> 00:03:13.913]  Well, welcome to InfoWars live coverage of the 2012 election.
[00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:22.437]  You know, the polls are not going to be closing for another couple of hours, but we've actually got some returns from Dixville Notch that are a little bit early.
[00:03:22.597 --> 00:03:24.238]  They love to be first in the nation.
[00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:35.042]  And so they, every year, or every four years in the presidential elections, they meet at midnight and they hold an election in Dixville Notch and they release the results right away.
[00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.443]  Now this year, the results were tied.
[00:03:37.763 --> 00:03:39.544]  Five for Romney, five for Obama.
[00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:48.394]  Uh, and what they had in, uh, actually in, uh, Hart's, they had another election, which is right there close by in New Hampshire.
[00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:51.096]  They had, uh, 23 votes for Obama.
[00:03:51.717 --> 00:03:54.900]  Romney got nine, and Gary Johnson got two.
[00:03:56.682 --> 00:04:04.209]  But a few years ago, I guess it was, uh, it was in 1992, when Andre Marou was running for Libertarian.
[00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:15.003]  They actually did an experiment in Dixville Notch, and what they did was they actually added... Sorry, let me get my earpiece here.
[00:04:15.504 --> 00:04:17.005]  Rob, I'm getting a lot of echo on that.
[00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.447]  Can you not get my feedback in here?
[00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.870]  Thanks.
[00:04:25.052 --> 00:04:29.957]  Anyway, in 1992, Andre Marou was running as a Libertarian nominee for president.
[00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:31.700]  And they did an experiment.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.648]  What they did was they gave every resident of Dixville Notch a subscription to Libertarian Magazine for a year.
[00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:40.335]  And the interesting thing was, that year, Andre Marou won.
[00:04:41.283 --> 00:04:42.784]  Now, there's an interesting lesson in that.
[00:04:42.844 --> 00:04:48.966]  I think one of the things that we need to look at is just how important education is.
[00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:53.948]  And, you know, getting people the message about the issues.
[00:04:54.548 --> 00:05:03.492]  After people focused on the issues, at least in that small town, at least at that one time, they picked somebody based on their liberty philosophy.
[00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:07.019]  Now that's exactly what we're trying to do with InfoWars.
[00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:08.621]  It's what we're trying to do with the magazine.
[00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:15.508]  I think as we look at this 20 years down the road, there was internet back in 1992, but 20 years down the road we've got
[00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:20.788]  A magazine that, I think, really helps to focus things.
[00:05:20.808 --> 00:05:26.832]  Because now, even though we've got the internet, there is a lot of fragmentation in the information stream.
[00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:29.554]  So it's very difficult to get people's attention, get their ear.
[00:05:29.974 --> 00:05:34.917]  When you've got a well-produced magazine that can put out the story for liberty, I think it can really have an effect.
[00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:47.683]  So today we're going to be looking at what the major parties have picked for us, and we don't really know who they've picked so far, but we're going to see that a little bit later.
[00:05:47.703 --> 00:05:57.254]  Like I said, we've still got a couple of hours before returns start to come in, but we do have some live polling that's going on on InfoWars' website itself.
[00:05:58.135 --> 00:06:08.244]  Uh, if you, uh, go to our website, you can participate in some polls and, uh, you can, uh, we've got a few things there asking you if you think polls are important.
[00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:11.608]  That is professional, quote-unquote, scientific polls that everybody does.
[00:06:12.048 --> 00:06:13.850]  Or if you think it's just a way to manipulate people.
[00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:21.037]  Uh, we've also got some, uh, things there to see, uh, who you voted for, what issues you think are important.
[00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:25.001]  Were you interested more in some ballot issues?
[00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:27.763]  There's some very important ballot issues that are going to be decided.
[00:06:28.384 --> 00:06:33.669]  And quite frankly, they're going to have as much of an effect on our lives as this presidential election is.
[00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:44.740]  Because, you know, these are some issues that are going to affect drug prohibition and civil liberties with marijuana ballot initiatives in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon.
[00:06:45.345 --> 00:06:51.930]  There's also going to be a very important ballot issue in California, Prop 37.
[00:06:52.631 --> 00:07:00.958]  Prop 37 is going to, it's truth in labeling law, and the question is, are we going to be able to know what's in our food?
[00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:09.945]  And we've got big agribusinesses been spending over a million dollars a day on this Prop 37 in California to try to defeat it.
[00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:17.501]  And I think we should all be wondering why it's so important to them to not let us know what they're putting in our food.
[00:07:18.943 --> 00:07:22.650]  Just, you know, don't tell the sheeple what's in the Soylent Green, I guess.
[00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:33.526]  But anyway, we've got a lot of polls there, and if you would like to participate in that, even if you would like to add some questions of your own, feel free to do that.
[00:07:33.606 --> 00:07:47.399]  You can either email me, David K. at Infowars.com, or you can tweet your questions to PuppetPrez, that's a hashtag, PuppetPrez, on Twitter, and we'll take a look at those, and we might possibly put your question up.
[00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:55.011]  We've also got news in terms of the quality of voting and the corruption that's going on.
[00:07:55.951 --> 00:08:00.654]  Back in North Carolina, where I'm from, we've had quite a few 112-year-olds that have voted this time.
[00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:02.334]  It's over 3,000 of those people.
[00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:06.797]  I guess you didn't know that we had that many 112-year-olds in North Carolina.
[00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:11.199]  We also have reports on Facebook of a man who voted four times.
[00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:16.982]  But even in my circle of friends, we had someone who went to a poll in Garner
[00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:22.960]  And was told that someone from his household had just been there and registered, and he lives alone.
[00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:30.025]  And they told him that his mother, who died six years ago, had just been there earlier and voted.
[00:08:30.972 --> 00:08:37.574]  Uh, they got out the, um, ballots, because in North Carolina, when you walk in, they don't require any kind of ID.
[00:08:37.634 --> 00:08:40.714]  Basically, all you have to do is give them a name and an address, and you're able to vote.
[00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:46.576]  But they do put a number on your ballot, and they put a number next to your name, so they're able to go back and retrieve the ballot.
[00:08:47.056 --> 00:08:53.217]  And they found that, uh, it was a straight Democrat ticket, although his mother had been a, uh, staunch Republican.
[00:08:53.237 --> 00:08:54.478]  Of course, that wasn't her anyway.
[00:08:56.238 --> 00:08:57.578]  We're seeing a lot of reports of that.
[00:08:57.638 --> 00:09:02.699]  That's the kind of thing that Bev Harris at blackboxvoting.org has talked about.
[00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:10.941]  And although those are incidents that really kind of stir our imagination and get us angry, that's just retail cheating.
[00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:16.522]  The real cheating that is very concerning is the wholesale cheating.
[00:09:16.562 --> 00:09:21.402]  And there's an article on Infowars.com about voting machine tampering.
[00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:24.743]  And as Bev Harris has pointed out, there's, you know, having
[00:09:25.584 --> 00:09:32.289]  Uh, valid voters that, uh, you know, making sure that your voters are valid, but then also making sure that the voting machines themselves aren't tampered with.
[00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:39.439]  Making sure that the votes don't disappear, the custody issue, until they are properly counted.
[00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:41.239]  So basically you've got four different steps there.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:48.202]  And those last steps is where the wholesale cheating can come in, in a massive amount.
[00:09:48.742 --> 00:09:50.343]  So that's the sort of thing we're looking at.
[00:09:50.423 --> 00:10:02.548]  And like I said on Infowars.com, there's an article about a lot of voting machine irregularities, where people cast a vote for one candidate, and it shows up for another candidate.
[00:10:04.217 --> 00:10:16.029]  We've also got an article here, I noticed that on, when I looked at the poll earlier, most of the people who had voted on InfoWars were, we asked who their presidential preference was.
[00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.931]  Gary Johnson was winning that poll.
[00:10:18.892 --> 00:10:25.178]  Chris Matthews, however, seems to think that that's not really a very valid choice.
[00:10:25.218 --> 00:10:26.820]  He actually went on a route.
[00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:31.078]  Uh, went on a rant about third-party voters.
[00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:34.420]  But we'll be covering that in just a few minutes.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.280]  We're going to be coming back.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:42.063]  We're going to be doing live feeds from reporters in the Austin area, talking to people as they're leaving the polls.
[00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:45.624]  We're also going to be going around to some of the political parties later tonight.
[00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:48.966]  But right now, we're going to be going back to Alex Jones.
[00:10:50.618 --> 00:10:50.998]  All right.
[00:10:51.038 --> 00:10:52.159]  Thank you, David Knight.
[00:10:52.659 --> 00:10:54.621]  And again, we're going to be here past midnight tonight.
[00:10:54.641 --> 00:11:02.626]  We kicked off a little bit late here because really we're beta testing between this studio and the other studio and our crew.
[00:11:02.706 --> 00:11:05.948]  But it is just a fabulous job that they're all doing here tonight.
[00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:13.954]  I have literal stacks of news coming in, but we'll learn more as the evening progresses.
[00:11:14.634 --> 00:11:16.014]  This is what we know right now.
[00:11:16.094 --> 00:11:18.935]  And then we're going to go to Gerald Cilente joining us from Ireland.
[00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:20.935]  It's pretty late at night over there.
[00:11:20.975 --> 00:11:21.295]  What is it?
[00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:21.795]  Midnight?
[00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:23.596]  And he's going to be joining us.
[00:11:23.636 --> 00:11:25.036]  The Wonders of Technology.
[00:11:25.056 --> 00:11:28.537]  But right now, excitement is building.
[00:11:29.037 --> 00:11:29.837]  Exit polls.
[00:11:30.637 --> 00:11:33.818]  Economy is still the number one issue in national exit polls.
[00:11:34.358 --> 00:11:37.839]  Obama has 190 electoral votes with Romney with 191 right now.
[00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:38.039]  Flashback.
[00:11:44.448 --> 00:12:04.474]  There is a report from 2004 that breaks down the fact that exit polls are historically inaccurate, but exit polls are showing that Romney has North Carolina and Florida is leading, that Obama is winning in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and other areas.
[00:12:05.154 --> 00:12:10.856]  A toss-up, Ohio, Virginia, Colorado, and places like Indiana.
[00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:18.084]  There's an interesting story here that I have about a foreign policy, that's a subdivision of the Washington Post, saying U.N.
[00:12:18.664 --> 00:12:20.907]  poll watchers amazed U.S.
[00:12:20.947 --> 00:12:24.631]  doesn't require IDs to vote.
[00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:28.656]  And they're marveling on the trust system.
[00:12:28.676 --> 00:12:31.400]  Well, yeah, with the electronic voting machines, no one else will accept.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.281]  And the fact that you can have retail fraud.
[00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:35.821]  It's just amazing.
[00:12:35.841 --> 00:12:39.622]  So we're going to be breaking all of this down here this evening.
[00:12:40.202 --> 00:12:46.323]  And we do have quite a laundry list of amazing guests coming up.
[00:12:46.403 --> 00:12:49.104]  First off, kicking it off, we're really thankful for him spending time.
[00:12:49.124 --> 00:12:55.285]  And when he's over there speaking to a large conference, and he's back there, I guess, in the back of the hall, you can see the big piles of chairs behind him.
[00:12:55.805 --> 00:12:58.086]  Gerald Celente, then Max Kaiser, also from
[00:12:58.886 --> 00:13:00.027]  The UK.
[00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:01.287]  He's joining us from England.
[00:13:01.888 --> 00:13:06.891]  Wayne Madsen, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Lou Rockwell, Nomi Prince, Webster Tarpley, and many others tonight.
[00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:12.754]  We will have our reporters out on the streets giving you some of what the sheeple are saying.
[00:13:12.774 --> 00:13:14.835]  Of course, a lot of people aren't sheeple now they're waking up.
[00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:19.698]  So joining us right now is Gerald Cilente.
[00:13:19.818 --> 00:13:24.201]  And Gerald, tell us exactly where you are in Ireland and what you're doing over there.
[00:13:25.716 --> 00:13:51.594]  Alex, I'm in Dublin, Ireland at the One World Chronicle Conference, and I just flew in from Munich two days ago, and I want to let you know that in Germany and in Ireland, everyone has been telling me, when you talk to Alex, tell him what great fans we are!
[00:13:51.634 --> 00:13:52.855]  Well, very humbling.
[00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:53.835]  I want to say hi to the
[00:13:55.407 --> 00:14:00.071]  Hundreds of thousands of people that are tuning in one way or another right now just to this special internet transmission.
[00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:06.576]  So, thank you Gerald and say that I'd love to drink a pint with all those great men and women there in the background.
[00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:12.441]  He said he would love to have a pint with all of you great men and women over there in the background.
[00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:17.926]  Oh man, I'm glad we decided to do this.
[00:14:18.447 --> 00:14:22.069]  Again, Gerald, tell us what you're doing over in Ireland, and then give us your call.
[00:14:22.089 --> 00:14:31.895]  I know you've been saying Obama for months, and it's neck and neck, but a lot of the pundits are saying, looks like four more years of the man of peace who's launching all these wars.
[00:14:33.066 --> 00:14:39.368]  Well, what I'm doing, I was just at a metals conference in Munich and the One World Chronicle conference over here in Ireland.
[00:14:39.388 --> 00:14:41.308]  They have a number of issues that they're dealing with.
[00:14:41.989 --> 00:14:46.290]  One of them, of course, is the bailouts of the banks, which are totally illegal.
[00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:53.452]  They're just taking the money from the people and giving it to the banks when there's actually no deal made at all between the banks that
[00:14:53.812 --> 00:14:58.438]  You know, knew what their risk would be, and then shaking down the people for all the money.
[00:14:58.839 --> 00:15:03.685]  So there's a real, you know how I've been talking, Alex, about Direct Democracy?
[00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:07.009]  Well, Direct Democracy Ireland is taking hold.
[00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.232]  DirectDemocracy.ie.
[00:15:09.673 --> 00:15:11.035]  The people are fed up with it.
[00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:11.996]  They, look,
[00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:14.077]  Look what's going on in the states.
[00:15:14.498 --> 00:15:17.900]  As you know, this is the first time I have not voted in an election.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.862]  Who could call this a democratic election?
[00:15:21.142 --> 00:15:23.304]  These clowns can't even count the votes.
[00:15:23.564 --> 00:15:25.045]  The whole game is rigged.
[00:15:25.285 --> 00:15:26.826]  The systems are breaking down.
[00:15:26.846 --> 00:15:29.008]  The people in Ireland are feeling it.
[00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.989]  They want no part of it anymore.
[00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:33.451]  And they're ready to rise up against it.
[00:15:33.991 --> 00:15:58.090]  And so what I'm over here talking about is the collapse of the currencies, the breakup of the European Union eventually, but more importantly Ireland joining with Switzerland to start moving forth with true democracy where the people will have the right to vote rather than it being controlled by the gangs that are controlling it now.
[00:16:03.516 --> 00:16:09.700]  We've talked to some of our reporters here in Austin, and polling places, like you just said, are broken down, not working.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.363]  We're getting reports of things flipped from Obama to Romney, Romney to Obama.
[00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:19.986]  We're like eight days into the hurricane on the East Coast, where you'd normally be, Gerald.
[00:16:21.027 --> 00:16:23.869]  And still, you know, government can't and won't help the people.
[00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.211]  Where do you see this insanity going?
[00:16:28.373 --> 00:16:29.174]  It's collapsing.
[00:16:29.214 --> 00:16:30.154]  The collapse is around us.
[00:16:30.174 --> 00:16:32.035]  You know what no one's talking about with New York?
[00:16:32.296 --> 00:16:33.957]  And you know me, I'm a Bronx New Yorker.
[00:16:33.977 --> 00:16:34.737]  I know the gig.
[00:16:35.238 --> 00:16:39.821]  The entire infrastructure of the United States is in collapse.
[00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:46.165]  And you get all these big-mouth politicians over there, shooting off their fat traps, saying about
[00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:48.866]  How we're going to be there for the people.
[00:16:49.147 --> 00:16:51.188]  And don't forget that we're there for you.
[00:16:51.528 --> 00:16:54.690]  The entire United States infrastructure is collapsing.
[00:16:54.970 --> 00:17:05.116]  We know the data coming out from the engineers that are saying it's going to cost an estimated $13 trillion just to get the thing back on track.
[00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:08.038]  That doesn't mean moving it into the 21st century.
[00:17:08.338 --> 00:17:10.419]  The entire nation is in collapse.
[00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:14.902]  And here's something else, Alex, that the prostitutes are not talking about.
[00:17:15.362 --> 00:17:20.724]  They're saying that an estimated 35-40% of the people already voted, correct?
[00:17:22.204 --> 00:17:22.564]  Yes.
[00:17:23.565 --> 00:17:30.447]  Alright, now, what imbecile believes that these clowns don't know what the vote count is?
[00:17:31.598 --> 00:17:32.938]  This is the Mafia.
[00:17:32.978 --> 00:17:34.339]  Let's get this straight.
[00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:36.559]  They know what the vote count is.
[00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:38.520]  This whole game is rigged.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:47.802]  What three-year-old does not believe that 30%, 35% of the people have already voted and no one knows?
[00:17:48.262 --> 00:17:49.763]  It's a secret.
[00:17:49.923 --> 00:17:50.903]  We promised.
[00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:52.743]  Scouts honor.
[00:17:52.764 --> 00:17:54.424]  Who are they kidding?
[00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:03.052]  So you're predicting, though, that in this whole war of the puppets, we're going to get Obama for four more years?
[00:18:03.092 --> 00:18:04.152]  That's still what you're predicting?
[00:18:04.692 --> 00:18:15.975]  Yeah, this is not one of the ones that I'm going to base my reputation on because, again, anything could go in a totally corrupt government.
[00:18:16.335 --> 00:18:21.297]  Let's remember who we're talking about so nobody misunderstands this.
[00:18:21.917 --> 00:18:28.566]  This is the same government where George W. Bush... Hey, haven't seen him on the campaign trail.
[00:18:28.827 --> 00:18:30.008]  What happened, you know?
[00:18:30.429 --> 00:18:33.012]  How come he's not out there like Bill Clinton?
[00:18:33.513 --> 00:18:38.380]  Because this is the same war criminal that lied the country into war.
[00:18:39.421 --> 00:18:41.822]  Of course they're gonna lie about anything.
[00:18:42.082 --> 00:18:48.625]  They'll steal votes, they'll kill your son, they'll rob your money, they'll do anything that they can.
[00:18:48.866 --> 00:18:50.346]  Who's gonna win the election?
[00:18:50.746 --> 00:18:54.968]  Whatever group of criminals be the best criminal on the block.
[00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.331]  Alright, I tell you, it is exciting over there.
[00:19:01.351 --> 00:19:04.233]  What I'm hearing from you, Jerry,
[00:19:05.516 --> 00:19:06.517]  ...already this year to Europe.
[00:19:07.418 --> 00:19:10.482]  Europe and Ireland and other areas are really waking up.
[00:19:10.562 --> 00:19:15.067]  Give us the sense, give us the sense of what they think about being under Bankster occupation.
[00:19:16.203 --> 00:19:17.503]  The people have had it, Alex.
[00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:20.344]  You know, I just came back from Ireland the last time I was here.
[00:19:20.364 --> 00:19:21.685]  It was a little over a year ago.
[00:19:22.505 --> 00:19:27.507]  Everywhere I look, there are signs, too late, for sale.
[00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:32.648]  Everywhere you look, they're beating the people down into the ground.
[00:19:32.848 --> 00:19:37.850]  They got this clown, he fit really good in the U.S., this guy named Noonan.
[00:19:39.419 --> 00:19:40.980]  The bureaucrats over there.
[00:19:41.421 --> 00:19:48.585]  They're paying one of the criminal guys who helped bring down the system that helped rob the money from the people.
[00:19:48.946 --> 00:19:49.546]  Check it out.
[00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:53.128]  This is a country of about 4 million people.
[00:19:53.148 --> 00:20:06.177]  This guy is getting 500,000 pounds a year in severance pay for pulling off the criminal act just the way they wanted him to do it.
[00:20:06.537 --> 00:20:08.479]  And you know what this clown Noonan says?
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.002]  We can't do anything.
[00:20:11.282 --> 00:20:12.444]  That's already been done.
[00:20:12.724 --> 00:20:14.887]  We have to steal more of your money.
[00:20:15.287 --> 00:20:15.848]  That's right.
[00:20:15.868 --> 00:20:18.111]  Look what's going on in Greece.
[00:20:18.891 --> 00:20:21.653]  Hundreds of thousands of people out into the streets.
[00:20:21.953 --> 00:20:23.674]  Look what's going on in Spain.
[00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:25.535]  Millions of indignados.
[00:20:25.915 --> 00:20:27.476]  You know my saying, Alex.
[00:20:27.836 --> 00:20:32.639]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[00:20:32.979 --> 00:20:35.660]  And they're starting to lose it here in Ireland.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.143]  You're finally seeing the fighting Irish spirit rise.
[00:20:46.087 --> 00:20:58.359]  Now, again, I agree with your point that we don't know who's going to win because it's a toss-up between two different criminal syndicates through election fraud and other systems trying to grab power.
[00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:00.021]  I mean, I'm looking at this.
[00:21:00.081 --> 00:21:02.863]  Thousands of dead Californians remain eligible to vote.
[00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:06.646]  We've got exit poll data will be examined in quarantine room.
[00:21:07.147 --> 00:21:07.347]  U.N.
[00:21:07.387 --> 00:21:08.728]  poll watchers amazed U.S.
[00:21:08.748 --> 00:21:10.209]  doesn't require IDs to vote.
[00:21:10.249 --> 00:21:11.210]  They're not here in Austin.
[00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:24.380]  It just goes on and on and on what is happening and the race is neck and neck but it doesn't even matter because Obama and Romney are bought and paid for by the banksters.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.502]  Gerald, describe though the differences if you see any.
[00:21:27.843 --> 00:21:31.625]  The similarities and the differences between these two men because earlier today
[00:21:32.526 --> 00:21:39.931]  I played a clip of Obama doing his, you know, Oprah crying and saying, you know, I don't lie to you, I tell you the truth.
[00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:51.659]  And we have an article at Infowars.com going over all the facts that, you know, was going to end torture, continued it, was going to shut Gitmo, expanded it, wasn't going to hire lobbyists, broke the records, wasn't going to have signing statements.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.701]  You know, the list goes on and on.
[00:21:53.721 --> 00:21:56.603]  Was against the NDAA, turned out they wrote it and signed it.
[00:21:57.023 --> 00:22:00.566]  I mean, it's incredible how the standards have dropped.
[00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:03.368]  So what are the similarities between Obama and Romney?
[00:22:03.408 --> 00:22:04.188]  What are the differences?
[00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:06.810]  I mean, what is your incredible trends forecasting?
[00:22:07.011 --> 00:22:10.233]  You know, someone's perspective everybody respects that I know.
[00:22:10.933 --> 00:22:25.985]  What will be the difference between the gangster chief Obama and his group of criminals and their management team of Slavery Incorporated and Obama's, you know, enemy over there only on paper, Mitt Romney and his people?
[00:22:27.284 --> 00:22:28.506]  It won't be a lot of difference.
[00:22:28.526 --> 00:22:30.248]  Let's go back to the debates.
[00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:37.878]  When they talk about foreign policy, listen to these little boys talking about how they have to take out Assad.
[00:22:38.398 --> 00:22:42.744]  Let's remember Obama, that wonderful Nobel Peace Prize winner.
[00:22:43.024 --> 00:22:49.049]  You know, the guy that sends predator drones in to blow up wedding parties and kids collecting wood.
[00:22:49.449 --> 00:22:52.371]  How about that wonderful humanitarian mission?
[00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:55.674]  Listen to that guy brag all the time.
[00:22:55.694 --> 00:23:02.999]  I took out, I said that if I had Osama Bin Laden in my sights, I'd pull the trigger.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.061]  I mean, come on, this is a little Boy Scout.
[00:23:06.402 --> 00:23:10.145]  You heard Obama talk about how he took out Gaddafi.
[00:23:10.865 --> 00:23:13.746]  And you're hearing the same thing with Romney.
[00:23:13.766 --> 00:23:31.935]  I do believe, however, that Romney will also out Obama on other areas, such as giving more freedom to the multinationals to rob us and steal in a different way.
[00:23:32.435 --> 00:23:38.639]  Obama, of course, will make it up in other ways by stealing more of our constitutional rights.
[00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:41.581]  Because, you see, Obama's a better liar.
[00:23:42.061 --> 00:23:43.122]  They both lie.
[00:23:43.342 --> 00:23:45.983]  But Obama, you know, he's a classier actor.
[00:23:46.404 --> 00:23:51.387]  So he could pull it off better, as he did the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:23:51.727 --> 00:23:56.892]  So Obama will be able to get away with it more in raping us to the Constitution.
[00:23:56.912 --> 00:24:02.537]  For Romney, you know, this guy is born on third base and thought he hit a triple.
[00:24:02.957 --> 00:24:05.360]  He's one of the white shoe boy supremes.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.322]  He'll be able to steal more of our money.
[00:24:08.763 --> 00:24:14.688]  So Obama will rob us of our life, and Romney will rob us of our money.
[00:24:15.209 --> 00:24:17.351]  In the end, we lose no matter what.
[00:24:19.151 --> 00:24:22.754]  And both guys, again, are bought and paid for by the same interest.
[00:24:22.834 --> 00:24:26.296]  I mean, people say Romney will launch more wars, and he's promised he will.
[00:24:26.857 --> 00:24:31.760]  But Obama launches wars and calls them peace, so I don't really see the difference there.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.441]  Well, that's what I was saying.
[00:24:33.562 --> 00:24:34.842]  Obama just lies better.
[00:24:35.283 --> 00:24:38.025]  But he'll rob us more of our constitutional rights.
[00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:42.048]  Look, Obama's the guy, just in case anybody's forgotten,
[00:24:43.083 --> 00:24:50.929]  You get arrested for having a drink, or your bicycle bell doesn't work properly, and they throw you in jail.
[00:24:51.429 --> 00:25:03.638]  Let's not forget that Obama, under the Solicitor General, his Solicitor General, Verrilli, now if you get arrested, take off your clothes.
[00:25:04.318 --> 00:25:04.898]  Bend over.
[00:25:05.579 --> 00:25:06.680]  Spread your legs.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:07.860]  That's right.
[00:25:08.321 --> 00:25:09.221]  That's Obama.
[00:25:09.782 --> 00:25:13.144]  Obama, you mentioned the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:25:13.644 --> 00:25:19.588]  They could come and take you and me away for having contacts with alleged terrorists.
[00:25:19.988 --> 00:25:20.809]  No charges.
[00:25:21.109 --> 00:25:21.870]  No jury.
[00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:23.551]  No writ of habeas corpus.
[00:25:23.831 --> 00:25:24.531]  No judge.
[00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:25.512]  No lawyer.
[00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:26.453]  No trial.
[00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:28.210]  That's Obama.
[00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.732]  Romney, Romney will rob all our money.
[00:25:32.092 --> 00:25:33.973]  This is the clown that grabs.
[00:25:34.453 --> 00:25:36.254]  Oh, I, you know, I'm a businessman.
[00:25:36.594 --> 00:25:38.115]  He's a hedge fund operator.
[00:25:38.315 --> 00:25:39.756]  He's the corporate vulture.
[00:25:39.776 --> 00:25:42.158]  Remember what Eisenhower said.
[00:25:42.718 --> 00:25:49.222]  Any man that seeks the presidency is either an egomaniac or crazy.
[00:25:49.702 --> 00:25:53.945]  This guy Romney hasn't stopped running since he's his little school boy.
[00:25:54.611 --> 00:25:57.975]  And they're egomaniacs and they're crazy.
[00:25:58.315 --> 00:25:58.976]  Hedge funds?
[00:25:59.236 --> 00:26:01.959]  Who the hell ever heard of hedge funds when we were growing up?
[00:26:02.459 --> 00:26:09.407]  This Romney, he put out a business, all the entrepreneurs that used to be in the Starry Store business.
[00:26:09.727 --> 00:26:11.909]  He brags that he creates jobs.
[00:26:12.209 --> 00:26:13.951]  You want a job at Staples?
[00:26:14.331 --> 00:26:15.092]  Wonderful!
[00:26:15.132 --> 00:26:16.393]  He brags about it.
[00:26:16.713 --> 00:26:19.075]  You could save $62.50 a week.
[00:26:19.496 --> 00:26:20.977]  You could stop shells.
[00:26:21.257 --> 00:26:25.661]  You could work all day long, but not enough to be a full-time worker.
[00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:27.423]  Only a temporary worker.
[00:26:27.883 --> 00:26:29.805]  So he could shaft you on benefits.
[00:26:30.307 --> 00:26:36.092]  Yeah, Romney wants to build a defense budget even bigger and screw everybody else.
[00:26:36.513 --> 00:26:39.395]  How could anybody vote for either of these people?
[00:26:39.675 --> 00:26:41.917]  They should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:26:42.278 --> 00:26:45.561]  They're casting a vote for a lesser of two evils.
[00:26:46.857 --> 00:26:48.518]  Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[00:26:48.598 --> 00:26:49.338]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:26:49.358 --> 00:26:51.380]  We're going to be here past 1 a.m.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:57.223]  Eastern Midnight tonight and we will start getting into more of the election returns and latest numbers.
[00:26:57.663 --> 00:27:02.166]  We got kicked off about 20 minutes late just because of some technical things between different studios.
[00:27:02.486 --> 00:27:05.188]  This is a live beta test that you're seeing.
[00:27:05.208 --> 00:27:08.650]  We're talking to Gerald Cilente all the way out in Ireland.
[00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:14.673]  And I appreciate David Knight getting thrown in the deep end with the sharks, throwing it to him first.
[00:27:14.713 --> 00:27:23.499]  It was supposed to be me up here tonight, but again, we had some technical things and some news gathering problems that we were working on before the show started.
[00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:31.544]  But again, this is InfoWars.com, true alternative grassroots media attempting to go out and engage the globalists.
[00:27:31.564 --> 00:27:32.845]  Now look at these headlines.
[00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:34.686]  CBS, we covered this earlier today.
[00:27:35.206 --> 00:27:38.587]  Video showing electronic voting machines changing the vote.
[00:27:39.067 --> 00:27:40.408]  People now know what to look for.
[00:27:40.468 --> 00:27:47.910]  You know, Gerald, just 12 years ago or so, I would see national polls where less than 10% of people believe there was election fraud.
[00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.931]  Now it's 80-90% depending on the poll.
[00:27:50.291 --> 00:27:52.291]  So people are getting more wise.
[00:27:52.612 --> 00:27:56.473]  They may get apathetic and just give up, but the point is at least people know
[00:27:57.293 --> 00:28:04.941]  Uh, that the corruption is getting worse and worse and the system's answer to that is a bigger police state, but what's it going to help the police if their pensions are no good either?
[00:28:05.402 --> 00:28:10.427]  How do you see these, uh, regardless of which new puppet gets in?
[00:28:11.653 --> 00:28:13.274]  Which new distraction gets in?
[00:28:13.994 --> 00:28:20.316]  Where do you see things going now here in the West with some of the developments in the economy, militarily?
[00:28:20.656 --> 00:28:28.238]  Hillary's now saying in the news today that we've got to go into Syria because Al-Qaeda's there.
[00:28:28.758 --> 00:28:29.979]  And the media doesn't say, wait,
[00:28:30.879 --> 00:28:32.640]  The State Department and NATO put him there.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.363]  I mean, things have reached an absurdist level that I can't even believe now.
[00:28:38.423 --> 00:28:42.405]  I mean, it's really entering cuckoo-for-cocoa-puffs zone.
[00:28:44.144 --> 00:28:46.466]  Let's talk about the wars, first of all.
[00:28:47.086 --> 00:28:53.732]  What's not making the news much is China and Japan going at it, thanks to the United States.
[00:28:54.412 --> 00:29:00.838]  Remember what I said, how you keep playing back, you know, Great Depression, currency wars, trade wars, world war.
[00:29:01.238 --> 00:29:02.759]  The trade war is heating up.
[00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:06.602]  The United States lost in Afghanistan, they lost in Iraq,
[00:29:07.623 --> 00:29:09.565]  It's stabilizing now Syria.
[00:29:09.585 --> 00:29:11.227]  They've already destroyed Libya.
[00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:14.750]  They're moving wars now into Mali and North Africa.
[00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.613]  And now they're refocusing into Southeast Asia.
[00:29:19.274 --> 00:29:21.957]  And now China and Japan are heating up.
[00:29:22.637 --> 00:29:24.239]  The world is heading to a war.
[00:29:24.779 --> 00:29:28.182]  Before I go further, I want to go back on a solution.
[00:29:28.883 --> 00:29:32.864]  We've been hearing about this voting fraud every damn election.
[00:29:33.345 --> 00:29:34.625]  Every damn election.
[00:29:34.985 --> 00:29:37.526]  Why wouldn't people think there's voter fraud?
[00:29:37.966 --> 00:29:41.867]  Because we have two frauds fronting, pretending to be President.
[00:29:42.488 --> 00:29:47.029]  We have frauds that are fronting, playing to be Congressmen and Senators.
[00:29:47.489 --> 00:29:49.510]  The whole system is a fraud.
[00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.751]  Here is what I suggest.
[00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:54.572]  I keep suggesting it over and over again.
[00:29:55.312 --> 00:29:55.532]  Alex.
[00:29:56.957 --> 00:30:02.439]  They move trillions of dollars a day around the globe.
[00:30:03.239 --> 00:30:06.280]  Rarely are the banking systems hacked.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.222]  If we could bank online, we can vote online.
[00:30:12.762 --> 00:30:18.424]  There's only one reason why they don't want us to vote online.
[00:30:18.884 --> 00:30:24.686]  The reason is, it would show that the people won't vote for them.
[00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:28.529]  That's the reason they're keeping it a webcast.
[00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:42.985]  Because we could have full transparency, because of all the computer minds out there, being able to figure out the algorithms, so that when cheating starts, everybody can see it.
[00:30:43.426 --> 00:30:45.749]  It would be totally transparent.
[00:30:46.289 --> 00:30:49.610]  This is the United States of America.
[00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:57.911]  These clowns spend over a trillion dollars a year on defense and defense-related expenditures.
[00:30:58.392 --> 00:31:04.993]  Who are they BSing when they say, oh, the voting systems are broken down?
[00:31:05.713 --> 00:31:07.553]  Could you pull up your zipper?
[00:31:07.914 --> 00:31:09.514]  Could you tie your shoes?
[00:31:14.423 --> 00:31:16.584]  Folks over on Iron, I like what they're hearing.
[00:31:17.145 --> 00:31:23.029]  Sure, instead we've got these computer systems that are all compartmentalized and secret and then they engage in fraud.
[00:31:23.069 --> 00:31:26.471]  The problem is, any system I think they're going to engage in fraud.
[00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:29.073]  I see your point about internet voting, getting everybody involved.
[00:31:29.653 --> 00:31:43.743]  My issue is, is that we went back to paper ballots counted at the precinct in front of everyone, then the numbers posted, then everything can be publicly put together and then integrated via computer, but then it can all be fact-checked right there at the grassroots.
[00:31:44.743 --> 00:31:46.084]  I agree with that as well.
[00:31:46.744 --> 00:31:47.244]  I agree 100%.
[00:31:48.525 --> 00:31:50.305]  But they're not going to do that.
[00:31:51.065 --> 00:31:53.086]  Again, this is the global age.
[00:31:53.886 --> 00:31:56.027]  Everything is moving in this direction.
[00:31:56.367 --> 00:32:04.550]  People are hooked on their I this and I that, iPad, you know, everything they have in their hand.
[00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.051]  They can't vote.
[00:32:06.994 --> 00:32:10.957]  You know, let's make this real, and again, at full transparency.
[00:32:11.478 --> 00:32:15.140]  Total transparency for everyone to monitor it.
[00:32:15.421 --> 00:32:17.462]  Because the numbers don't lie.
[00:32:17.683 --> 00:32:19.044]  The liars lie.
[00:32:19.344 --> 00:32:21.005]  The whole game is rigged.
[00:32:21.486 --> 00:32:30.793]  As I said, they rob our money, they rob us of our lives, and now the great United States of America, these BS artists,
[00:32:30.973 --> 00:32:36.400]  That are always talking about exporting democracy, you don't even have it at home.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.304]  You can't even vote for one of the two criminal groups.
[00:32:42.392 --> 00:32:45.533]  Wow, well, we're going to be finding out here pretty soon.
[00:32:45.573 --> 00:32:48.115]  You know, they're talking about devastation on the East Coast.
[00:32:48.135 --> 00:32:49.735]  Gerald, you've been in Europe the last week.
[00:32:50.115 --> 00:32:55.858]  What is your take on Hurricane Sandy and the horrible response of government?
[00:32:55.878 --> 00:33:02.561]  They claimed all these great things, as usual, couldn't deliver, and it turned out it was community centers, churches, and individuals
[00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:08.064]  Helping the public, but I saw numbers and I talked to listeners who confirmed it in New York, New Jersey and other areas.
[00:33:08.464 --> 00:33:13.627]  More than half the public made no preparation, even as they were told the storm was coming in.
[00:33:13.987 --> 00:33:25.274]  If the depression continues to worsen, what's going to happen to all these people out there that absolutely have to be taken care of, or they're just going to go and die, basically?
[00:33:26.118 --> 00:33:27.859]  You know, Alex, look at the people.
[00:33:27.899 --> 00:33:31.121]  By the way, as I said, you have loads of fans everywhere.
[00:33:31.501 --> 00:33:35.824]  And a lot of them are telling me, boy, we're glad we're preppers.
[00:33:36.244 --> 00:33:38.205]  We're glad we're survivalists.
[00:33:38.585 --> 00:33:40.607]  Hey, how come they're not making fun of them?
[00:33:40.947 --> 00:33:42.848]  Hey, the toilet paper of record.
[00:33:42.968 --> 00:33:45.109]  You're also like pessimism porn.
[00:33:45.429 --> 00:33:49.472]  I guess you must be a porn dealer if you're a prepper, right?
[00:33:50.072 --> 00:33:59.876]  I saw that little clown, Krugman, bragging about what a great job Obama's doing, even though he doesn't have electricity in his house.
[00:34:00.336 --> 00:34:03.197]  The entire system is collapsing.
[00:34:03.517 --> 00:34:04.878]  They can't cope with it.
[00:34:05.258 --> 00:34:08.139]  Let's put this in perspective, Alex.
[00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.720]  This was a Category 1 hurricane.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.501]  In real countries, you know what they have?
[00:34:13.982 --> 00:34:16.023]  They have floodgates in front of tunnels.
[00:34:16.483 --> 00:34:18.385]  You know what they have in real countries, Alex?
[00:34:18.825 --> 00:34:27.751]  They have subway systems that doesn't make you feel like you're in the whole of Calcutta when you go into the New York subway system.
[00:34:28.051 --> 00:34:30.233]  You know what they have in real countries, Alex?
[00:34:30.793 --> 00:34:34.395]  They have their power lines buried beneath the ground.
[00:34:34.776 --> 00:34:37.457]  You know what they have in real countries, Alex?
[00:34:37.938 --> 00:34:40.960]  They have real civil defense systems.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.020]  You know what they have in other countries, Alex?
[00:34:44.361 --> 00:34:45.981]  They take care of the people.
[00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:50.522]  The people, everybody makes fun of preppers.
[00:34:50.962 --> 00:34:56.743]  If you can't see why you should be prepared now, you're never going to see it.
[00:34:57.403 --> 00:35:00.003]  Now, let's put this into perspective fully.
[00:35:01.183 --> 00:35:06.564]  Let's suppose that there's a real terrorist strike in Manhattan.
[00:35:07.224 --> 00:35:07.944]  Or Atlanta.
[00:35:08.545 --> 00:35:10.665]  Or in Washington or San Francisco.
[00:35:11.758 --> 00:35:27.727]  Let's suppose that because of United States foreign policy, you know, they have those wonderful terror Tuesdays when President Obama signs off, oh, let's kill that guy, let's kill this one, and they kill a lot of innocent people, and someone wants to get even.
[00:35:28.548 --> 00:35:30.389]  Suppose a dirty bomb goes off.
[00:35:31.409 --> 00:35:35.031]  Suppose there's a terrorist strike with a suitcase-sized nuke.
[00:35:35.872 --> 00:35:39.574]  Suppose there's a biological warfare weapon.
[00:35:40.356 --> 00:35:43.119]  You wanna see the systems break down?
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.625]  You wanna see entire sections of the country go off the grid?
[00:35:49.305 --> 00:35:51.548]  They're ill-prepared to handle it.
[00:35:51.828 --> 00:35:53.149]  What are they gonna do?
[00:35:53.690 --> 00:36:01.117]  Put Janet Napolitano on a horse and drive out and save the day?
[00:36:01.157 --> 00:36:03.480]  They'd better get a Clydesdale for her!
[00:36:10.205 --> 00:36:19.543]  Gerald, what's going to happen to the system, though, as not just here, but all over the world, the fraud of government and these corrupt insider monopoly corporations comes out?
[00:36:19.563 --> 00:36:22.688]  I mean, I guess they just think their police state is going to protect them.
[00:36:23.978 --> 00:36:25.339]  Yes, it's global.
[00:36:25.759 --> 00:36:31.301]  As I mentioned to the conference here tonight, there's a leadership vacuum worldwide.
[00:36:31.761 --> 00:36:41.805]  Let's call a spade a spade and call these clowns who they are and see how ignorant they are and how everything they've tried they've failed at.
[00:36:42.642 --> 00:36:46.386]  You got Cameron over in the UK and Kenny over here.
[00:36:46.846 --> 00:36:49.990]  You got Obama there and you got Merkel over here.
[00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:58.939]  You got Rajoy Stick over there and you got Barroso now, one of the commissioners in Europe, telling people what to do.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.883]  You got Draghi and three-card Monty over in Italy.
[00:37:03.524 --> 00:37:06.285]  You got one loser after another.
[00:37:06.545 --> 00:37:08.366]  You got Ben Bernanke.
[00:37:08.746 --> 00:37:15.610]  You got one loser after another that's destroying the system in front of everybody's eyes.
[00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:19.431]  And then they're telling us, give us more power.
[00:37:19.912 --> 00:37:21.352]  We know how to fix it.
[00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:22.513]  Oh, brilliant.
[00:37:22.813 --> 00:37:27.135]  The same clowns that messed it up are now going to fix it.
[00:37:27.635 --> 00:37:29.476]  The systems are collapsing.
[00:37:29.576 --> 00:37:31.277]  Oh, I can't forget about China.
[00:37:33.678 --> 00:37:39.523]  66% of the Chinese companies that are listed are late in paying their bills.
[00:37:40.143 --> 00:37:47.408]  The Chinese government has lowered interest rates two times within the last three weeks to keep propping up the economy.
[00:37:47.909 --> 00:37:54.694]  They're dumping trillions of yuan into the system trying to pump up the failing housing bubble.
[00:37:55.414 --> 00:37:58.895]  Over here in Europe, they came out with a new line.
[00:37:59.415 --> 00:38:01.955]  Outright Monetary Transactions.
[00:38:02.395 --> 00:38:06.756]  For stupid people who can't think, we'll just call it OMT.
[00:38:07.156 --> 00:38:08.636]  Isn't that a nice name?
[00:38:09.257 --> 00:38:17.758]  That means dumping more paper money on top of other worthless paper money to cover the other worthless paper money that they can't cover.
[00:38:18.478 --> 00:38:20.679]  The entire systems are collapsing.
[00:38:20.739 --> 00:38:22.259]  Here's my forecast, Alex.
[00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:26.221]  I'm voting for Obama to win.
[00:38:26.321 --> 00:38:27.802]  Not that I'm voting for him.
[00:38:27.822 --> 00:38:29.003]  I'm not voting.
[00:38:29.523 --> 00:38:30.924]  But I'm hoping he wins.
[00:38:30.964 --> 00:38:31.705]  You know why?
[00:38:32.285 --> 00:38:34.887]  Because no one expects anything of him.
[00:38:35.428 --> 00:38:45.134]  So the transparency of this fraud could be shown really quickly when there are no other plans that he could come up with.
[00:38:45.575 --> 00:38:51.059]  And then we'll have to go into a new system because the one that they're propping up is going to collapse.
[00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:56.921]  If Romney, however, wins, then you're going to hear, Romney has a plan.
[00:38:57.241 --> 00:38:58.602]  Let's give him a chance!
[00:38:59.022 --> 00:39:01.503]  They always say the same crap after every election.
[00:39:02.023 --> 00:39:05.164]  So who can get away with it for several more months?
[00:39:05.944 --> 00:39:16.888]  So we can't wait several more months because in several more months, they'll figure out how to steal several trillion more dollars from us and drive us deeper into depression.
[00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:30.989]  So your view is Obama will come in, he'll make it worse even faster, but a new puppet, it'll take people time to figure out that Romney's a complete fraud, so in a way worse is better.
[00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:36.033]  And you know, as a radio host, it's predominantly conservative-libertarian.
[00:39:36.593 --> 00:39:44.636]  I mean, I'm a libertarian constitutionalist, but I obviously don't like the Republican Party that is, you know, fake conservatives and so deceptive.
[00:39:45.096 --> 00:39:49.638]  But I sit there and I watch them, and as soon as Romney gets elected, they're all going to go to sleep.
[00:39:50.058 --> 00:39:59.582]  So from a cynical view, you know, I'm like, hey, you know, Obama gets back in, you know, people may actually wake up, plus it's good for my radio show, but that's not how I think.
[00:40:00.082 --> 00:40:01.603]  I'm just so torn because
[00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:05.285]  I wish there was some way out within the system.
[00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:08.667]  It's like being told you got terminal cancer or something.
[00:40:08.687 --> 00:40:10.348]  You know, you're wishing there was some way out of it.
[00:40:11.149 --> 00:40:15.291]  But it really is just a comeuppance that we're entering.
[00:40:16.472 --> 00:40:25.738]  You know, Gerald Cilente, I want you first to take some time to talk about your website, the Trends Journal, and the type of information people can get there because it's so invaluable.
[00:40:26.058 --> 00:40:30.621]  But then spend about 10 minutes, I'm going to give you the floor in closing, to kind of give us a
[00:40:32.162 --> 00:40:34.964]  Breakdown of what you covered in Germany and Ireland.
[00:40:34.984 --> 00:40:37.646]  You know, kind of give us a speech if you've got time.
[00:40:37.666 --> 00:40:43.991]  You can go 20 minutes if you like, then we'll go to David Knight with the latest election news here in our other studio.
[00:40:44.031 --> 00:40:55.399]  But if you've got the time, I know it's late at night over there, you know, tell us about the Trends Journal and then, you know, break down, you know, kind of your speech, kind of a little shortened, truncated version.
[00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:01.174]  Well, on the Trends Journal, of course, you know, we're looking at what's going to happen before it happens.
[00:41:01.254 --> 00:41:02.715]  It's history before it happens.
[00:41:03.235 --> 00:41:11.742]  And the purpose of the Trends Journal is to prepare people so that they can make plans, just like being a prepper, a survivalist, but in many different fields.
[00:41:12.262 --> 00:41:13.543]  Where is there going to be growth?
[00:41:13.603 --> 00:41:15.104]  Where is there going to be decline?
[00:41:15.524 --> 00:41:16.684]  Where should you put your money?
[00:41:16.725 --> 00:41:18.245]  What should you consider doing with it?
[00:41:18.606 --> 00:41:20.947]  What are going to be the educational opportunities?
[00:41:21.227 --> 00:41:23.828]  What are going to be the business advantages and declines?
[00:41:24.329 --> 00:41:26.010]  That's what the Trends Journal really does.
[00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:30.172]  And as you know, Alex, we make it available to virtually everyone.
[00:41:30.512 --> 00:41:32.233]  We have a discount request page.
[00:41:32.553 --> 00:41:34.635]  We know people are going through difficult times.
[00:41:34.975 --> 00:41:36.316]  Just fill out the information.
[00:41:36.336 --> 00:41:37.557]  There's nothing personal there.
[00:41:37.897 --> 00:41:42.240]  And we will do the very best we can to make it available for everyone.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:54.327]  So what my talks are about, in both Munich and in Dublin, here at the One World Chronicle, is beginning with, you know, what trend forecasting is.
[00:41:55.088 --> 00:41:55.928]  And how
[00:41:57.202 --> 00:41:59.628]  You can really see the face of the future.
[00:41:59.668 --> 00:42:01.092]  You can't forecast it.
[00:42:01.533 --> 00:42:02.636]  No one can predict it.
[00:42:02.676 --> 00:42:04.240]  There are too many wildfires.
[00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:12.735]  But when you tell people things that they don't like, because they're locked into a belief system, they don't want to believe them.
[00:42:13.316 --> 00:42:23.664]  But when you go to a doctor, and you get a diagnosis that you don't care for, you don't get a lot of baloney shooting back at the doctor for hearing what you don't want to hear.
[00:42:24.365 --> 00:42:32.392]  But when people hear political, economic, social news that you're not ready for, they really take it personally, they can't break out of their belief systems.
[00:42:33.393 --> 00:42:35.434]  So that's the first part of the presentation.
[00:42:36.195 --> 00:42:42.878]  The second part of the presentation is tracking trends is an understanding of where we are.
[00:42:43.278 --> 00:42:50.142]  And you know from the work of the Trends Journal and what I do, we paint a picture of the present like no one else does.
[00:42:50.582 --> 00:42:55.105]  And I'm not saying that because, oh, we're doing it, but the facts stand on their own.
[00:42:55.865 --> 00:42:59.268]  And I make this very clear, you know, we're only human.
[00:42:59.308 --> 00:43:00.329]  We make mistakes.
[00:43:00.409 --> 00:43:02.051]  But we're at this since 1981.
[00:43:02.831 --> 00:43:06.635]  And our track record is unparalleled to anyone's.
[00:43:07.215 --> 00:43:16.223]  Be it in gourmet coffees, to clean water, to clean foods, to the panic of 08 and the crash of 1987.
[00:43:17.044 --> 00:43:20.026]  So it's one after another we've been on the money.
[00:43:21.107 --> 00:43:28.653]  So the purpose, though, however, is not so much to say this is what we've done and how good we're doing it.
[00:43:29.094 --> 00:43:34.398]  We're saying to people, get in touch so you can see where it's going.
[00:43:35.219 --> 00:43:43.446]  And forecasting trends is the knowledge of where we are and the understanding of where we were, how we got here.
[00:43:43.786 --> 00:43:49.331]  So let's talk, for example, about the panic of 08 and where we are today.
[00:43:50.598 --> 00:44:04.711]  You can see that panic was going to happen when we first wrote about it in 2004 and actually coined the term the Great Recession and said it would hit by late 2007.
[00:44:05.271 --> 00:44:07.393]  And it did.
[00:44:07.994 --> 00:44:09.075]  How did we know?
[00:44:09.315 --> 00:44:11.017]  Again, looking back,
[00:44:11.912 --> 00:44:15.894]  We knew because the dot-com crash of 2000.
[00:44:17.675 --> 00:44:22.538]  When that happened, we knew that there was going to be no recovery.
[00:44:23.538 --> 00:44:25.659]  But, 9-11 happened.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:32.623]  And they used 9-11 as an excuse to juice the economy.
[00:44:33.503 --> 00:44:34.424]  We're under attack.
[00:44:35.202 --> 00:44:36.723]  They hate our freedom and liberty.
[00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:38.984]  And who comes to the rescue?
[00:44:39.604 --> 00:44:40.984]  Alan Greenspan.
[00:44:41.004 --> 00:44:47.267]  The guy that couldn't speak one damn sentence without making any sense.
[00:44:47.807 --> 00:44:52.229]  The same jerk that every call that he ever made was wrong.
[00:44:52.709 --> 00:44:55.931]  So he really shafted it to everybody.
[00:44:56.471 --> 00:44:58.332]  He lowered interest rates to 46-year lows.
[00:45:01.013 --> 00:45:05.117]  They con people into taking out loans they couldn't afford.
[00:45:05.137 --> 00:45:08.600]  Hey, you want to build that addition onto your house?
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.202]  Don't you know how much value you have there?
[00:45:11.602 --> 00:45:12.823]  We're going to give you a loan.
[00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:15.185]  Have no income verification.
[00:45:15.526 --> 00:45:17.988]  Hey, don't worry about it.
[00:45:18.428 --> 00:45:19.830]  We'll give you the money.
[00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:20.991]  Hey, pay us back.
[00:45:21.031 --> 00:45:22.212]  Hey, we're friends.
[00:45:22.832 --> 00:45:25.655]  Don't worry when you get the money, you give it to us.
[00:45:26.475 --> 00:45:38.820]  Alan Greenspan, that other little weasel, that other little fed creep, that other Bernanke clone, was the guy that set up the whole system for failure.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.661]  So we show people how it happened.
[00:45:42.161 --> 00:45:45.642]  They conned everybody into taking out bad loans.
[00:45:46.222 --> 00:45:49.583]  The loans went bad and we do this, we show where we were.
[00:45:49.603 --> 00:45:51.284]  And what did they do?
[00:45:51.584 --> 00:45:53.585]  They came out with a big lie.
[00:45:53.985 --> 00:45:56.846]  The big lie was we had to bail out the banks.
[00:45:57.186 --> 00:46:03.488]  They're too big to fail, because, hey, after all, they're better than you and I. They're too big to fail.
[00:46:03.548 --> 00:46:05.428]  If they fail, we're no good.
[00:46:05.488 --> 00:46:06.448]  We'll all die.
[00:46:06.788 --> 00:46:09.449]  Let's steal people's money and give it to the banks.
[00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:17.811]  So what I do is I show people by using a PowerPoint America's long-term decline.
[00:46:18.532 --> 00:46:19.952]  And I do it with pop culture.
[00:46:20.932 --> 00:46:23.193]  I show, for example, Duke Ellington.
[00:46:24.076 --> 00:46:32.099]  You know, looking as the Duke does, with a top hat and a tuxedo, and playing a couple of bars of Take the Atrium.
[00:46:32.959 --> 00:46:36.581]  And then I showed Kanye West in Jay-Z.
[00:46:36.941 --> 00:46:38.641]  Yeah, you remember Jay-Z!
[00:46:38.941 --> 00:46:42.763]  He was out there beating the band for Obama yesterday!
[00:46:43.323 --> 00:46:44.243]  Out in Ohio!
[00:46:44.744 --> 00:46:48.525]  And it couldn't even fill the auditorium with him and Bruce Springsteen.
[00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:55.168]  Who gives a damn what Jay-Z or Bruce Springsteen thinks about anything?
[00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.010]  I agree with you.
[00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.831]  You're getting continual coverage of the real election.
[00:47:01.891 --> 00:47:07.054]  This is historical and I just want to commend the amazing crew up here and what they're doing tonight.
[00:47:08.508 --> 00:47:15.212]  I sit here and I watch all this unfold, Gerald, and I see the corrupt globalists fleeing the U.S.
[00:47:15.812 --> 00:47:24.757]  after they've engineered its collapse, and I commend the fact that you've said you're going to stay here and fight it out in the info war and then in other ways if need be.
[00:47:25.797 --> 00:47:35.583]  If we beat these people, folks will look back just like they look back on the French resistance against the Nazis, or just like they look back on the Poles or the Ukrainians standing up against the Soviets.
[00:47:37.124 --> 00:47:43.447]  I just wish that people that weren't historically or politically uninitiated, I wish they understood this is not hyperbole.
[00:47:44.468 --> 00:47:47.250]  Those of us that are staying here do so at the threat of our lives.
[00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:48.170]  This is not a game.
[00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:48.931]  It's not a joke.
[00:47:49.791 --> 00:47:52.793]  And there's really three different groups of people in this country.
[00:47:52.813 --> 00:47:59.958]  I mean, you can break it down into more, but you've got the small, tiny insider technocrat parasite elite that knows the public's unconscious and dumbed down.
[00:48:00.718 --> 00:48:13.524]  And then you've got the giant mass of just people trying to work, muddle through, but they've been brought up to be continual children, arrested development, literally don't know how to tie their shoelaces or the television didn't tell them how.
[00:48:14.044 --> 00:48:20.407]  And then you've got people that are actually aware of what's happening and are horrified by it, trying to wake up.
[00:48:20.987 --> 00:48:23.888]  You know, the zombified sheeple masses.
[00:48:24.208 --> 00:48:30.050]  And you've got the system doing everything it can to further dumb people down.
[00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.130]  And, you know, you mentioned preppers.
[00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:37.232]  Hey, let's make fun of preppers that were prepared in New Jersey, New York, and other areas.
[00:48:38.532 --> 00:48:41.133]  Pennsylvania, Ohio, they're able to take care of people now.
[00:48:42.413 --> 00:48:44.494]  And as usual, government couldn't and wouldn't deliver.
[00:48:46.846 --> 00:48:51.687]  Again, it's this instinct of the parasitic robber baron class to want a bunch of victims.
[00:48:52.307 --> 00:49:01.089]  But then they destroy their own infrastructure, which they have now hijacked, in the process of this will to power, this will to total domination.
[00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:07.131]  And the globalists all compete with each other over who can be the most wicked, who can be the most manipulative.
[00:49:07.971 --> 00:49:10.432]  In the final equation, it all blows back on them as well.
[00:49:10.492 --> 00:49:11.432]  I mean, take Prop 37.
[00:49:11.652 --> 00:49:16.354]  You know, most polls showed at 2 to 1, people want to be able to know what's in their food.
[00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:25.998]  If it's GMO, cross-species, rose-its-own-pesticide, you know, makes bugs' guts burst, but they say it's safe for humans.
[00:49:26.738 --> 00:49:29.302]  And then they come out and say, oh, suddenly everybody's for it.
[00:49:29.603 --> 00:49:34.210]  That's all just a hoax ahead of electronic voting machine fraud with that proposition.
[00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.472]  I've known that for a long time.
[00:49:35.912 --> 00:49:39.878]  But this can only work so long while they're killing us with this stuff.
[00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:57.154]  And so, I mean, I'm kind of ranting here off of what you've said, but first speak to, if you agree with the kind of three basic groups of people and what's going to happen as the sheep and their master vampires, you know, as things collapse, try to scapegoat those of us that were proven right.
[00:49:57.174 --> 00:49:58.874]  I mean, you were called a pessimist porn dealer.
[00:49:58.934 --> 00:50:01.475]  I've been demonized and all these things constantly.
[00:50:01.935 --> 00:50:04.656]  But then everything we talk about, unfortunately, is unfolding.
[00:50:04.936 --> 00:50:08.277]  We're not happy to say the Titanic is listing and about to go under.
[00:50:08.897 --> 00:50:10.098]  You know, get to the lifeboats.
[00:50:11.359 --> 00:50:12.060]  It's sad.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:18.365]  I mean, I guess Orwell said, in the world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:50:19.085 --> 00:50:20.366]  And I'm kind of ranting here.
[00:50:20.486 --> 00:50:21.147]  It's just that...
[00:50:22.469 --> 00:50:29.272]  You know, you watch the general public identifying with Romney as their savior and their personal hero and what makes them have value in the world.
[00:50:29.652 --> 00:50:37.336]  Or you watch the Obama supporters and the Obama phone and identifying with government as their power instead of themselves being their power.
[00:50:37.416 --> 00:50:46.520]  And it's just sad to watch humanity drained by a scientific tyranny and to know we're going down this nightmare road.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.261]  So I mean, kind of in that rant,
[00:50:50.041 --> 00:50:52.343]  What groups do you see out there?
[00:50:52.763 --> 00:50:54.625]  And then, you know, your take on things like Prop 37.
[00:50:55.966 --> 00:50:57.587]  Well, it's what you said.
[00:50:57.647 --> 00:51:03.011]  Yes, there are the people that just follow, the three groups that you said, you know, the elites and the others.
[00:51:03.692 --> 00:51:05.153]  And you asked me about my talk.
[00:51:05.713 --> 00:51:12.758]  And another part that I showed them the trends that are developing, where the economies are going, the great wars that are emerging.
[00:51:13.874 --> 00:51:21.160]  But really the crux of the entire speech is that everyone has to find the greatness within them.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.382]  This doesn't have to be the Ukraine.
[00:51:24.823 --> 00:51:27.365]  This doesn't have to be the Soviet Union.
[00:51:28.005 --> 00:51:31.248]  This doesn't have to be a police state.
[00:51:31.728 --> 00:51:35.471]  This doesn't have to be a revolution of bullets and bombs.
[00:51:35.531 --> 00:51:36.452]  On the contrary,
[00:51:36.932 --> 00:51:42.877]  You know, as Einstein made very clear, nothing comes to peace by violence.
[00:51:43.337 --> 00:51:44.598]  That begins in violence.
[00:51:45.199 --> 00:51:49.443]  So my message is really an intellectual and spiritual revolution.
[00:51:49.983 --> 00:51:53.086]  And there are a lot of wonderful people everywhere I go.
[00:51:53.766 --> 00:52:14.445]  And when you show them that they don't have to cower to clowns, and when you really break down, which I do, who the people are that are leading us, and how unqualified and what psychopaths they are, that the only thing that's stopping people from changing the future are the people themselves.
[00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:17.828]  The people don't know the power that they have.
[00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:23.674]  As you began this, Alex, by talking about the small group of elites.
[00:52:24.435 --> 00:52:26.837]  It's a small group of elites.
[00:52:27.338 --> 00:52:32.103]  They are powerless without the police being their power.
[00:52:33.024 --> 00:52:37.769]  And once the police abandon them, they have no power.
[00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:40.511]  The power is with the people.
[00:52:41.171 --> 00:52:48.733]  But the people power only comes about, as I believe it, when the people work to find the greatness within them.
[00:52:49.873 --> 00:53:01.557]  So one of the messages that I say, what I talk about, is I'm a believer, and I'm sure you are, and everybody listening is, that each of us have these unique gifts.
[00:53:02.912 --> 00:53:10.774]  Bringing those unique gifts that we have, working on them, because everybody knows it takes a lot of work to own your craft.
[00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:14.816]  When you keep doing that, you rise to higher levels.
[00:53:15.396 --> 00:53:18.777]  When you raise the bar, you don't accept mediocrity.
[00:53:19.717 --> 00:53:25.519]  And when the individual changes, the collective consciousness changes.
[00:53:26.463 --> 00:53:37.545]  I have to say this, Alex, with everything that I believe, and every ounce of blood, truth, and passion in me, the time has never been better than now.
[00:53:38.126 --> 00:53:39.206]  And I'll tell you why.
[00:53:40.126 --> 00:53:48.648]  You mentioned earlier that years ago, when you say 12 years ago, 10 years ago, there was voter fraud, people wouldn't believe it.
[00:53:49.308 --> 00:53:52.812]  And then eight years, a couple of more people did start believing.
[00:53:53.453 --> 00:53:59.840]  And as it keeps moving forward, and then you mentioned in numbers, 80 to 90% of the people believe.
[00:54:00.518 --> 00:54:04.282]  You look at the numbers of how many people no longer believe in government.
[00:54:04.783 --> 00:54:05.523]  In Congress.
[00:54:05.904 --> 00:54:10.369]  What is it, like 16 or 17% of the people believe in Congress?
[00:54:10.689 --> 00:54:14.093]  And those are the flunkies that work for them and have the federal jobs.
[00:54:14.433 --> 00:54:16.275]  That's why they believe.
[00:54:16.335 --> 00:54:19.839]  Sure, some numbers are as low as 9% approval rating for Congress.
[00:54:20.519 --> 00:54:22.580]  9% approval rating for Congress.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.121]  Now here's the point.
[00:54:24.801 --> 00:54:28.242]  The vacuum has never been larger.
[00:54:28.862 --> 00:54:31.544]  It could be filled with anything.
[00:54:31.944 --> 00:54:33.804]  The void is there.
[00:54:34.425 --> 00:54:42.128]  You have an empty suit and a stuffed shirt that's vying for the White House.
[00:54:42.668 --> 00:54:45.169]  How transparent can it be?
[00:54:45.569 --> 00:54:52.372]  It could be filled with anything, and my message is, let's fill it with greatness.
[00:54:52.772 --> 00:55:01.296]  The greatness of the people, the spirit of the people, the dignity of the people, the courage of the people,
[00:55:01.656 --> 00:55:07.681]  The respect of the people, the integrity of the people, and the passion of the people.
[00:55:08.061 --> 00:55:15.046]  Those are unstoppable values that the politicians are defenseless against.
[00:55:15.406 --> 00:55:20.710]  That's what I believe, and that's why I say the time is now.
[00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:22.612]  Well said.
[00:55:22.632 --> 00:55:24.993]  Listen to folks there in Ireland.
[00:55:25.053 --> 00:55:27.355]  What city are you in in Ireland there, Gerald?
[00:55:29.357 --> 00:55:30.658]  What city are you in in Ireland?
[00:55:31.598 --> 00:55:31.838]  Dublin.
[00:55:32.299 --> 00:55:32.719]  Dublin.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:37.645]  Well hey, tell folks out there that I salute the great Irish people.
[00:55:37.705 --> 00:55:40.829]  I've got quite a bit of Irish blood running through my veins.
[00:55:40.889 --> 00:55:41.469]  I'm proud of that.
[00:55:41.489 --> 00:55:43.351]  I'm proud of all my ancestors.
[00:55:43.371 --> 00:55:44.172]  But I want to say this.
[00:55:44.633 --> 00:55:52.061]  If you go to Alexa.com or you go to Google Analytics, there is only one country
[00:55:53.086 --> 00:55:59.449]  People would think that online, I would be rated number one, my highest ratings would be in the US.
[00:55:59.509 --> 00:56:05.172]  I'm like rated 480-something, which is huge, in the United States.
[00:56:05.552 --> 00:56:12.536]  Last time I checked, there's only one country where InfoWars.com is rated higher, and it's Ireland.
[00:56:12.576 --> 00:56:13.716]  In fact, maybe we can show that.
[00:56:13.736 --> 00:56:19.199]  If you go to Alexa.com and type in InfoWars.com, it'll show country ratings.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.181]  And last time I checked, it's been this way for years,
[00:56:23.482 --> 00:56:25.444]  Ireland is where we're most popular.
[00:56:25.804 --> 00:56:26.704]  And so I just want to say this.
[00:56:26.744 --> 00:56:36.191]  We salute all the folks over there that know the euro's a tyranny, that know the globalists are a tyranny and hate the banksters and want sovereignty and freedom for our countries.
[00:56:36.451 --> 00:56:38.413]  So I salute the Irish right now.
[00:56:38.713 --> 00:56:39.374]  God bless them.
[00:56:40.074 --> 00:56:41.075]  Let me tell him that.
[00:56:41.695 --> 00:57:03.045]  Alex said he salutes the Irish, he's a lot of Irish in him, and Infowars is rated higher in Ireland than anywhere else in the world, and that he's against the tyranny, against the euro, and wants you people to fight against the bank of tyranny, and he is all on your side.
[00:57:03.245 --> 00:57:04.566]  Alex, you should know this.
[00:57:17.225 --> 00:57:18.586]  And one other thing, Alex.
[00:57:19.286 --> 00:57:23.889]  If you want to show how disgusting it all is, imagine this.
[00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:31.554]  They're trying to introduce genetically modified potatoes into Ireland.
[00:57:31.574 --> 00:57:32.715]  Unbelievable.
[00:57:32.755 --> 00:57:33.275]  I saw that.
[00:57:33.315 --> 00:57:34.236]  How disgusting.
[00:57:34.776 --> 00:57:36.417]  How disgusting, he said.
[00:57:36.477 --> 00:57:37.418]  They're not going to put up with that.
[00:57:38.318 --> 00:57:40.240]  He said you won't put up with that.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.181]  You're right, they're not.
[00:57:41.581 --> 00:57:48.227]  Alex, is there anything that I could tell the folks here in Ireland that they should know about the election?
[00:57:48.527 --> 00:57:52.971]  What you are hearing, what I could tell them, and what you see coming out.
[00:57:53.766 --> 00:58:03.075]  Sure, it is still neck and neck, and we're going to have the great David Knight, one of our great reporters, breaking down some of those numbers here in just a few minutes.
[00:58:03.095 --> 00:58:04.976]  But Romney has won Kentucky.
[00:58:05.557 --> 00:58:13.905]  The Associated Press and others report, and I'm getting a lot of this from Infowars.com and DrudgeReport.com, where our team, Curt Nemmo and Adon Salazar, and they're posting articles.
[00:58:13.985 --> 00:58:15.386]  Romney has won Indiana.
[00:58:15.786 --> 00:58:17.228]  Obama has won Vermont.
[00:58:17.908 --> 00:58:19.150]  Enough, let's count.
[00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:27.515]  Uh, currently popular vote, Romney 53, Obama 46, but it'll be the Electoral College, uh, that decides it.
[00:58:27.915 --> 00:58:33.839]  And they're, they're talking about if people can't vote in New York, uh, postponing it, but we'll see what, uh, happens there.
[00:58:33.859 --> 00:58:37.061]  And this is what I wanted to raise, uh, to you because you mentioned this.
[00:58:37.081 --> 00:58:41.905]  Uh, CBS News is reporting in New York, women are giving away sex.
[00:58:42.665 --> 00:58:43.826]  For gasoline.
[00:58:44.566 --> 00:58:45.967]  Sandy gas woes continue.
[00:58:45.987 --> 00:58:50.289]  People trading gas for sex on Craigslist and vice versa.
[00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:56.171]  Showing how I'm a cook to be putting in a gas tank at my house and having a well and rainwater collection.
[00:58:56.211 --> 00:58:58.052]  And so are you, Gerald, for having a garden.
[00:58:58.793 --> 00:58:59.573]  But here it is.
[00:59:00.013 --> 00:59:06.096]  People within seven, eight days giving sex for a can of gas to run their generators so they can cook something.
[00:59:06.456 --> 00:59:07.877]  Where's the almighty government?
[00:59:09.056 --> 00:59:16.740]  Yeah, Alex is saying that people are reporting in New York that women are selling themselves to sex for gasoline.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.001]  That they can't get gas in the city.
[00:59:20.902 --> 00:59:24.863]  They may postpone the voting in New York.
[00:59:25.524 --> 00:59:28.225]  They're without heat and electricity now.
[00:59:28.265 --> 00:59:29.906]  It's going on seven days.
[00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:32.947]  People are desperate doing anything.
[00:59:33.467 --> 00:59:40.068]  And as far as the election is going, Romney's ahead 53% in the popular vote.
[00:59:40.288 --> 00:59:41.909]  They're still counting the votes.
[00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:45.069]  And, of course, the electoral votes.
[00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:49.851]  So far, Romney has won Kentucky and Indiana.
[00:59:51.731 --> 00:59:55.932]  Romney, Kentucky and Indiana.
[00:59:56.132 --> 00:59:59.373]  And Romney, Obama in Vermont.
[01:00:01.987 --> 01:00:04.708]  Yes, sir, that is exactly what's going on.
[01:00:04.728 --> 01:00:08.269]  Now just on the Ireland subject, it's usually Ireland's number one.
[01:00:08.289 --> 01:00:11.850]  I just checked today, probably because of the election, we're having more U.S.
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:12.270]  visitors.
[01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:18.452]  But guys, if you punch up alexa.com for TV viewers here on my computer feed right here.
[01:00:18.492 --> 01:00:19.652]  No, I mean, I have it punched up.
[01:00:19.693 --> 01:00:20.553]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:00:21.253 --> 01:00:22.893]  There is alexa.com.
[01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.654]  You can just put my feed up and I'll show people.
[01:00:26.115 --> 01:00:26.835]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:33.158]  If you type in InfoWars.com to this, there you can see I'm rated in the U.S.
[01:00:33.178 --> 01:00:36.499]  465, in Ireland, 495, but usually we're number one in Ireland.
[01:00:37.419 --> 01:00:50.244]  Again, we're most popular in Ireland, so that just shows that the great Irish people are not naive and are awake, and I'm proud of the fact that I've seen in the polls out there that they didn't want to be part of the Euro, but were forced into it, and I hope that
[01:00:51.524 --> 01:01:00.367]  I hope the great Irish people over there get out of the Euro and go back to the national sovereignty and arrest all the foreign bankers that have hijacked your country.
[01:01:01.448 --> 01:01:10.951]  Alex said that he says he hopes you go out of the Euro, get back into your sovereignty, and arrest all the foreign bankers that have stolen your money.
[01:01:13.456 --> 01:01:16.377]  All right, well listen, again, Gerald, thank you so much.
[01:01:16.597 --> 01:01:18.178]  Obviously, we love having you on.
[01:01:18.578 --> 01:01:21.899]  You are, hands down, our listeners' favorite guest.
[01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:24.259]  There's a lot of great ones we have on Great Minds Men and Women.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.501]  You're my mother's favorite guest, and I salute you, and thank you for staying up late.
[01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:37.544]  And seriously, tell all those folks that we just appreciate them, and I wish I was there with you right now.
[01:01:38.284 --> 01:01:41.685]  And in closing, anything else, Gerald Cilente, you'd like to add from Dublin?
[01:01:42.486 --> 01:01:44.207]  I think that's about it, Alex.
[01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:57.158]  And Alex said he wishes he was here with you, and spoke of coming and visit you, and said that the reason that he's number one in all of the countries with the highest rating is because the Irish people are among the most awake.
[01:01:57.978 --> 01:01:59.379]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:01:59.419 --> 01:02:00.360]  We just showed those numbers.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.381]  Very interesting.
[01:02:01.701 --> 01:02:05.004]  Alright, Gerald Cilente, give out your website one more time.
[01:02:06.274 --> 01:02:12.979]  TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com, and Alex, thanks for all you're doing, and thanks for having me on tonight.
[01:02:13.279 --> 01:02:13.800]  All the best.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:14.420]  You bet.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:14.820]  You bet.
[01:02:14.881 --> 01:02:15.701]  Thank you so much.
[01:02:16.342 --> 01:02:18.023]  Alright, there goes Gerald Cilente.
[01:02:18.043 --> 01:02:22.386]  We're going to throw it in about a minute to David Knight, and I'm going to be honest about something tonight.
[01:02:24.998 --> 01:02:26.279]  I try to do too much.
[01:02:26.299 --> 01:02:41.190]  I ate breakfast this morning and I've had allergies a little bit under the weather and then I was just so busy all day I never ate again so I kind of had low blood sugar when I got in here today and well I mean I left for about an hour went to exercise like I'm a wild man came back.
[01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:43.651]  You know, took a shower, got ready, got here to do the show.
[01:02:43.671 --> 01:02:44.951]  We had a few technical difficulties.
[01:02:45.951 --> 01:02:47.272]  And I'm not complaining about that.
[01:02:47.312 --> 01:02:58.435]  You know, the fact is, is that I look at how I'm trying to go as hard as I can, nonstop, and then I see so much of the public, who even if they're awake, they're, you know, they're not involved.
[01:02:59.115 --> 01:03:00.836]  And it is such an honor.
[01:03:01.896 --> 01:03:13.584]  Uh, to be working with people here at the Infowars crew, but also to get to know people like Gerald Salente, uh, and Max Keiser, who's coming up in about 40 minutes, uh, and so many others.
[01:03:14.245 --> 01:03:30.075]  And it is so good to know that the cream of the cream, the creme de la creme of patriots worldwide, from Japan to Ireland, from Russia to Mexico, from Canada to the United States, from South Africa to
[01:03:32.036 --> 01:03:39.180]  Chile, there are patriots everywhere who have the love of liberty beating in their breast and who want to be free.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:51.907]  And I just want to commend the great job the whole crew's done, because we're testing going to Ireland, the studio on one end of the building, interfacing with the other studio, video, audio streams, all the graphics people.
[01:03:51.927 --> 01:03:55.049]  I mean, I know they don't want credit, but I just want to say our crew is
[01:03:55.649 --> 01:03:56.230]  Is awesome.
[01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:06.640]  I will tell you, in my gut, in my intellect, in my spirit, I have been very, not depressed, but not even low, but more focused the last six months.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.342]  I think a lot of people have noticed that.
[01:04:08.362 --> 01:04:16.029]  And because I am so much more focused, I am pretty dark and a little bit nasty sometimes on air and in person.
[01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:17.191]  Because here's the deal, folks.
[01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:20.292]  They are putting cancer viruses in the vaccines to kill us.
[01:04:20.332 --> 01:04:22.633]  They are putting GMO out there to hurt us.
[01:04:22.913 --> 01:04:24.393]  They are spraying us with chemicals.
[01:04:24.433 --> 01:04:26.574]  They are doing all these tests on us.
[01:04:26.674 --> 01:04:29.415]  And I take it very, very personal.
[01:04:29.815 --> 01:04:32.736]  And I can't just slough it off and not take it personal.
[01:04:33.806 --> 01:04:38.010]  I mean, I really hate the New World Order, but I don't fight them because I hate them.
[01:04:38.431 --> 01:04:50.223]  I love good people so much that when my four-year-old daughter, the image of innocence and goodness, looks into my eyes and is so good, it is like somebody is stabbing me in the guts.
[01:04:51.264 --> 01:04:57.172]  And people, it's because I know the evil's there and I feel like I don't have power to stop them.
[01:04:57.473 --> 01:05:03.561]  I know you've got the power collectively to move against these people and I know they're enemies of all of us.
[01:05:03.921 --> 01:05:05.844]  I know they must be crushed, they must be defeated.
[01:05:06.084 --> 01:05:06.845]  I know I'm right.
[01:05:07.586 --> 01:05:16.031]  I know it's far worse than I can even describe it with my feeble intellect and my feeble repertoire of oratory aplomb.
[01:05:16.551 --> 01:05:21.474]  I do not have the words to transmit to you how dire our straits are.
[01:05:21.494 --> 01:05:22.835]  And that's not to create fear.
[01:05:23.235 --> 01:05:26.197]  That's to create reality.
[01:05:27.299 --> 01:05:34.782]  Okay, because this is real, ladies and gentlemen, and the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard the full spectrum.
[01:05:35.142 --> 01:05:39.563]  An individual is too limited to be able to fully even grasp this.
[01:05:40.283 --> 01:05:44.605]  But what I can grasp and what you can grasp is impossible to articulate.
[01:05:45.327 --> 01:05:55.353]  So even our tiny vision that we can see of the New World Order is overwhelming itself, not to mention what we don't know.
[01:05:56.074 --> 01:05:59.276]  Anything you can imagine is going on.
[01:05:59.976 --> 01:06:07.761]  I've learned that if I can imagine it by staring into the minds of the evil ones, I can go look it up online and they're doing it.
[01:06:08.911 --> 01:06:09.211]  Okay.
[01:06:09.891 --> 01:06:14.033]  And then up it again, up it again, up it again, up it again.
[01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:17.714]  And that's why I pour myself out here trying to fight these people.
[01:06:17.754 --> 01:06:20.074]  And so it's going to be ugly sometimes.
[01:06:21.135 --> 01:06:27.957]  It's not going to be said well sometimes, because I'm literally like, you know, somebody who's just fighting for their life.
[01:06:28.257 --> 01:06:32.398]  I'm like somebody who's, you know, in a steel grate submerging water trying to get out.
[01:06:33.038 --> 01:06:37.919]  And I know humanity's being destroyed around me, and you're being annihilated as well.
[01:06:38.259 --> 01:06:40.599]  Together we can bend these bars and get out of here.
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:47.261]  But you've got to understand, folks, that's why when people call up and say, we're counting on you, thank God you're there, folks, thank God you're there.
[01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.681]  You are the power of InfoWars.
[01:06:50.041 --> 01:06:57.663]  That's why we are this imperfect, but you're imperfect as well, instrument, this lens through which we can focus your power.
[01:06:57.983 --> 01:06:59.623]  And I'm trying to live up to that.
[01:07:01.112 --> 01:07:09.152]  I'm trying to live up to that, but by saying that and giving you this report on where we stand and what we do, you need to live up to it too.
[01:07:10.157 --> 01:07:11.658]  Because this is life and death.
[01:07:11.938 --> 01:07:12.559]  This is real.
[01:07:12.599 --> 01:07:20.965]  If we beat these people and the history books are written, this will be the example for humans for all time to come of what not to do, what we've allowed to be set up.
[01:07:21.045 --> 01:07:27.629]  I mean, we mindlessly trust foreign corporations and globalists to run our elections with no checks and balances.
[01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:33.934]  We mindlessly let eugenics companies run GMO food that kills insects when they eat it, feed it to us.
[01:07:34.214 --> 01:07:37.216]  I mean, we are beyond insanity right now.
[01:07:37.536 --> 01:07:38.857]  We are beyond
[01:07:39.818 --> 01:07:41.861]  Hell itself.
[01:07:42.582 --> 01:07:44.824]  This is a rending of everything.
[01:07:44.844 --> 01:07:48.509]  But there's so much good while all that evil is unfolding.
[01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:49.751]  There is so much good.
[01:07:49.771 --> 01:07:53.475]  We're going to go to about a 10-minute report with David Knight.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:55.981]  I don't know.
[01:08:13.348 --> 01:08:17.512]  We are fighting as hard as we can here for you, and that's why I want to thank all of you.
[01:08:17.532 --> 01:08:36.048]  When you spread the word about the audio feeds, the podcasts, the video feeds, when you spread the word about Twitter and what we're doing there, when you spread the word about Facebook they're trying to kick us off of, when you spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, you are shoving this wagon uphill against the globalists, despite everything they've done, despite everything they've thrown at us.
[01:08:37.463 --> 01:08:42.426]  We are still gaining ground on the enemy, and that's why they're so much more desperate.
[01:08:42.466 --> 01:08:53.331]  So understand, we are in, we are in that 12th round like Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, and George Foreman throwing everything he can.
[01:08:54.132 --> 01:08:58.954]  George Foreman's a good guy, I hate to give him the part of the New World Order, but David Iacocca was talking to him off-air today, he was giving me this analogy.
[01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.576]  They're throwing everything they can at us.
[01:09:03.047 --> 01:09:08.951]  Okay, in this 12th round, and pretty soon they're not going to be able to raise their hands.
[01:09:09.611 --> 01:09:15.315]  And we're going to be able to continue, because as their evil is exposed, we're fresh, they're played out.
[01:09:16.096 --> 01:09:19.358]  All you've got to do is stand against these people and they will fall.
[01:09:19.398 --> 01:09:26.082]  We'll also later do some feeds from on the streets, we also have those archived, we're going to be posting them up at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:27.303 --> 01:09:29.445]  And we're going to continue here, as I said, with
[01:09:30.245 --> 01:09:33.268]  With Max Keiser and so many others.
[01:09:33.308 --> 01:09:42.996]  But here is David Knight from the other studio about, I don't know, what is it, about 80 yards from where I sit in the TV studio to give us some of the updates on the latest.
[01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:46.620]  David Knight for InfoWars, Nightly News, and this special election coverage.
[01:09:49.534 --> 01:09:50.194]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:09:50.434 --> 01:09:52.115]  That was an interesting report from Ireland.
[01:09:52.175 --> 01:09:57.497]  It's good to know that people are waking up worldwide, especially as many people as you've got awake in Ireland.
[01:09:58.758 --> 01:10:03.740]  Just in, we've had six states close their poll on the East Coast at 7 o'clock.
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.841]  That's about a half hour ago.
[01:10:05.621 --> 01:10:08.342]  And it looks like everything is coming in pretty tight.
[01:10:08.882 --> 01:10:13.704]  In Virginia, the exit polls still show that it's so tight that they're not calling it for either candidate yet.
[01:10:13.764 --> 01:10:16.265]  So it looks like this is going to run fairly late in the night.
[01:10:18.254 --> 01:10:21.897]  Neither Romney or Obama have a slight lead in Virginia.
[01:10:22.438 --> 01:10:30.724]  In Ohio, another crucial battleground, it's going to close its polls right about now, about 7.30pm, so we should be getting those returns in pretty quickly.
[01:10:31.465 --> 01:10:38.591]  But Romney has won Indiana and Kentucky, it's been called for him so far, and Obama has won Vermont.
[01:10:39.378 --> 01:10:54.209]  Now, our theme for this election is Puppet Prez, and actually you can use the hashtag Puppet Prez to ask us questions, put poll questions on, and also to follow discussion.
[01:10:54.690 --> 01:11:01.435]  But we thought it'd be kind of interesting to take a look at some of the numbers and see who's actually pulling their strings.
[01:11:02.355 --> 01:11:03.915]  See who's actually giving them the money.
[01:11:03.935 --> 01:11:04.535]  You know, H.L.
[01:11:04.575 --> 01:11:08.676]  Meekin said that an election is an advanced auction of stolen goods.
[01:11:08.716 --> 01:11:13.317]  They're not handing out tens of millions of dollars to these candidates just because they're civic-minded.
[01:11:13.877 --> 01:11:15.817]  They expect they're going to get something back for that.
[01:11:16.558 --> 01:11:26.639]  They give them millions of dollars and they get back billions, sometimes trillions of dollars in terms of contracts, in terms of preferential legislation, in terms of bailouts.
[01:11:26.659 --> 01:11:28.240]  We've seen this happen many times before.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.580]  OpenSecrets.org
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.520]  Yes, we are.
[01:11:46.528 --> 01:11:47.629]  Look at the amount of money.
[01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:51.812]  That's a little bit different than you typically hear from the mainstream media.
[01:11:52.072 --> 01:11:58.576]  It sounds like Romney is the one with all the money, and yet he was outspent 2 to 1, or out-raised 2 to 1 by Obama.
[01:11:59.036 --> 01:12:07.722]  And to put that in perspective, just think about the fact, now this is about a billion dollars, a little bit over a billion dollars that the two of them have taken in.
[01:12:08.243 --> 01:12:14.527]  Going back to 1996, both presidential candidates spent, raised $240 million.
[01:12:16.748 --> 01:12:18.249]  About a quarter of where it is right now.
[01:12:18.649 --> 01:12:21.610]  In 2000, it went up to 343 million.
[01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:25.993]  And in 2004, it went up to 655 million.
[01:12:26.613 --> 01:12:31.155]  And so, we've gone from there to a billion in just a couple of election cycles.
[01:12:31.235 --> 01:12:32.676]  And it's kind of scary.
[01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:39.139]  You know, when you have as much power as is concentrated in Washington, it's going to act like a black hole to money.
[01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:43.901]  Because increasingly, the federal government is taking over our economy.
[01:12:44.481 --> 01:12:51.284]  And if you want anything done, if you want money, you've got to get permission from Washington to do something or they'll shut you down.
[01:12:51.984 --> 01:12:57.207]  And of course, they're sitting on a huge stash of counterfeit bills that they're printing at will.
[01:12:58.007 --> 01:13:02.469]  The next graphic we've got up here looks at sectors that are favoring Romney.
[01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:04.850]  And this again is from OpenSecrets.org.
[01:13:05.871 --> 01:13:16.040]  You look at it, you can see that Romney's contributors, that he raises more from agribusiness, construction, the energy and natural resources industries.
[01:13:16.361 --> 01:13:18.462]  But look at the finance industry and banking.
[01:13:19.263 --> 01:13:23.607]  To break that down, Obama got $18 million, Romney got $52 million.
[01:13:24.047 --> 01:13:28.872]  And by far and away, as we'll see when we look at these, it's the banks that are contributing the most amount of money.
[01:13:29.152 --> 01:13:31.114]  If we look at the sectors that are favoring Obama,
[01:13:31.954 --> 01:13:35.855]  It's communications, and of course, lawyers and lobbyists.
[01:13:36.695 --> 01:13:40.516]  He leads in lawyers and lobbyists, 25 million to 13.
[01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:46.037]  Now, if you recall, Obama said that he really wasn't going to have any lobbyists.
[01:13:46.217 --> 01:13:55.119]  They were going to basically be banned out of the Obama White House, but that clearly hasn't happened, and they don't think they're going to be thrown out in his second term either.
[01:13:55.939 --> 01:13:59.100]  If we take a look at the sectors with equal contributions,
[01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.296]  This is also kind of interesting.
[01:14:01.856 --> 01:14:06.599]  The two sectors where they were essentially even were in defense and in health.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:14.764]  And we know that when we watched the foreign policy debate that there really wasn't much of a difference in foreign policy between Obama and Romney.
[01:14:14.785 --> 01:14:19.648]  I don't remember how many times Romney said he agreed with Obama, but it was really high.
[01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:24.671]  Somebody put together a video showing all the times that he said, yeah, he has that exactly right.
[01:14:25.291 --> 01:14:32.394]  We're not going to see much difference in that, and we're going to see both of them ramp up more and more wars, and more and more military spending.
[01:14:32.834 --> 01:14:41.078]  So the military-industrial complex really didn't spend that much money on either of them, and kind of gave it to them equally, because they're going to profit regardless of who's in there.
[01:14:41.638 --> 01:14:45.440]  The other thing I thought was interesting was if you look at the health industry.
[01:14:46.845 --> 01:14:52.146]  The health industry contributed quite a bit of money, but they contributed it equally to both candidates.
[01:14:53.047 --> 01:15:00.988]  Again, you've got a candidate who gave us Obamacare, and you've got Romney who basically drafted Obamacare for the state level.
[01:15:01.429 --> 01:15:06.810]  So clearly the health industries think that they're sitting pretty good with both of those candidates.
[01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:11.151]  And then if we look at the last graphic we've got here, the combined donations by sector.
[01:15:12.037 --> 01:15:23.769]  Take a look at this and look at how in finance, as we come down here, look at how finance dominates the donations based on all these other industries that we took a look at.
[01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:33.159]  And that of course goes to Romney, but health and lawyers and lobbyists, that is the next two bars there, those are both for Obama.
[01:15:33.817 --> 01:15:42.599]  So, although Romney took in about half as much as Obama, he got a tremendous amount of bankster money.
[01:15:42.619 --> 01:15:49.900]  But that's not to say that Goldman Sachs and the rest of the banks don't have a friend in the White House now.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:55.621]  Goldman Sachs has quite a few people that are filling up the cabinet and various other offices there.
[01:15:56.241 --> 01:16:00.642]  So, looks like it's going to be more of the same, regardless of who wins.
[01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:03.799]  And we've got Melissa Melton out in the field with a report.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.481]  Melissa, are you there?
[01:16:06.582 --> 01:16:07.503]  Yes, I'm here, David.
[01:16:07.743 --> 01:16:08.124]  Can you hear me?
[01:16:08.444 --> 01:16:09.465]  Yes, we can hear you.
[01:16:10.226 --> 01:16:11.167]  What have you got there for us?
[01:16:12.008 --> 01:16:15.793]  I'm actually here at the Travis County Courthouse where we've been talking to people who come out.
[01:16:16.723 --> 01:16:21.185]  Pickings are kind of slim, but so far we've seen a pretty overwhelming support for Obama.
[01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:27.607]  Actually, the last guy I talked to said that he voted for Obama because Obama did such a great job on education.
[01:16:28.267 --> 01:16:38.751]  And when I went ahead and asked him, well, what do you think about Obama expanding the Patriot Act and voting for indefinite detention with the NDAA, he told me that those things don't pertain to him.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.503]  And I said, well, you are an American citizen, correct?
[01:16:42.983 --> 01:16:48.088]  And he said, yeah, but you can't get everything you want and not everyone keeps all their promises.
[01:16:48.208 --> 01:16:50.230]  So, so far that's what we're seeing.
[01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:54.394]  We actually did also see a guy who was just walking up and down the sidewalk randomly throwing up.
[01:16:55.155 --> 01:17:01.621]  I'm assuming he's getting sick and tired of having to choose between Globalist Puppet A and Globalist Puppet B in our American election circus.
[01:17:03.101 --> 01:17:12.148]  Yeah, he doesn't think that trial, indefinite trial without due process or any kind of charges put against him, he doesn't think that will ever affect him, right?
[01:17:12.868 --> 01:17:14.729]  No, he said that doesn't pertain to him.
[01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.230]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:17:16.811 --> 01:17:18.112]  Oh, I hope it doesn't pertain to him.
[01:17:18.172 --> 01:17:22.735]  I hope it doesn't pertain to us either, but we have to really be worried about a system that's thrown that out.
[01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:24.347]  Yes, we do.
[01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:30.352]  Well, we've got Alex with another guest right now, so we're going to go right back to him over in the radio studio.
[01:17:30.372 --> 01:17:31.213]  Alex, back to you.
[01:17:31.373 --> 01:17:34.295]  Hey, David, it's too early to tell, but just a quick question for you.
[01:17:34.335 --> 01:17:35.576]  This is pretty amazing.
[01:17:35.897 --> 01:17:39.480]  With almost no planning, our first beta test, we've got reporters on the ground.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.581]  You're in the studio.
[01:17:40.601 --> 01:17:43.664]  We've got folks from Ireland, England, and you're in there.
[01:17:44.264 --> 01:17:49.065]  And early, it looks like Mitt Romney's pulling ahead, but you never know in one of these horse races.
[01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:53.647]  Plus, you know, in the final equation, what really matters is what voter news services does.
[01:17:53.727 --> 01:18:02.009]  But I tell you, if Romney does win, I think we're going to see some civil unrest, and I'm not looking forward to that.
[01:18:03.336 --> 01:18:04.936]  I've been building that up, haven't I?
[01:18:05.036 --> 01:18:07.237]  And I don't know so much that Romney's pulling ahead.
[01:18:07.297 --> 01:18:12.078]  I mean, the states that have come in so far are states that people were expecting Romney to do well in.
[01:18:12.118 --> 01:18:14.279]  We haven't really heard from most of the northeastern states.
[01:18:14.379 --> 01:18:19.180]  And I guess it's going to be kind of interesting to see what happens in New Jersey and New York.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:25.042]  I know that there's a report that just came across the desk here saying that in New Jersey they're trying to do
[01:18:26.042 --> 01:18:27.763]  That just sounds like it's tailor made for fraud.
[01:18:43.488 --> 01:18:43.888]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.469]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:44.569 --> 01:18:45.069]  Absolutely.
[01:18:45.089 --> 01:18:45.509]  Yeah.
[01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:47.010]  And everybody is applying for these.
[01:18:47.091 --> 01:18:49.232]  It's not just people who are affected by Sandy.
[01:18:49.912 --> 01:18:51.053]  Everybody is applying for them.
[01:18:51.073 --> 01:18:52.734]  They're all applying all at once.
[01:18:52.834 --> 01:18:55.996]  And so, you know, the New Jersey just can't handle it.
[01:18:56.077 --> 01:18:57.998]  So, by the way, David, we're going to Max Keiser.
[01:18:58.018 --> 01:18:58.938]  But I got to say this.
[01:18:59.659 --> 01:19:05.143]  You are kicking butt doing live without teleprompters and technical difficulties.
[01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:06.403]  I just want to say this.
[01:19:06.644 --> 01:19:09.385]  I am so glad to have you here at the Infowars operation.
[01:19:10.006 --> 01:19:12.828]  And we just really appreciate you coming down here from North Carolina.
[01:19:13.528 --> 01:19:13.929]  Oh, thanks.
[01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:14.991]  It's great to be here.
[01:19:16.514 --> 01:19:19.679]  Your honest assessment of this lunatic asylum, what do you think of the operation?
[01:19:21.322 --> 01:19:21.983]  It's doing great.
[01:19:22.264 --> 01:19:23.907]  I'm really excited to see the new sets.
[01:19:23.947 --> 01:19:26.151]  We just started construction today of one of the new sets.
[01:19:27.427 --> 01:19:30.049]  It's going to be really interesting to see how these things work out.
[01:19:30.069 --> 01:19:31.651]  I guess we're going to be doing that the next week, right?
[01:19:32.051 --> 01:19:32.371]  Pretty much?
[01:19:32.652 --> 01:19:33.092]  Absolutely.
[01:19:33.172 --> 01:19:36.115]  In the next month we're going to build like three new sets.
[01:19:36.375 --> 01:19:36.975]  Absolutely.
[01:19:36.995 --> 01:19:38.236]  And we're trying to go to the next level.
[01:19:38.657 --> 01:19:44.622]  And with people like you and Jakari Jackson and Melissa Melton and everybody, I just keep marveling at the great job you guys are doing.
[01:19:44.642 --> 01:19:48.245]  I mean, you guys did Internet Contest and there were so many great entries.
[01:19:48.285 --> 01:19:51.668]  We got like five, six reporters in here and everybody's just been incredible.
[01:19:52.008 --> 01:19:56.949]  It's good to see that the people have built something real, and we're giving the globalists a run for their money.
[01:19:57.229 --> 01:20:03.771]  The problem is they want to come in now and try to censor all of that with all of this new internet censorship and cyber security.
[01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:05.791]  We'll talk about that with Max Keiser.
[01:20:05.811 --> 01:20:06.631]  Come up in about 40 minutes.
[01:20:06.651 --> 01:20:09.632]  We'll get another update with David Knight.
[01:20:09.992 --> 01:20:14.493]  Later, Jakari Jackson's going to be in his chair covering all of this, and then after midnight,
[01:20:15.233 --> 01:20:19.254]  The crew is probably going to continue, if they've got any juice left, with a roundtable discussion.
[01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:19.954]  I may join them.
[01:20:20.854 --> 01:20:23.995]  And of course, we'll all pop champagne when Obama wins, because that's who we're rooting for.
[01:20:24.015 --> 01:20:25.235]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:20:25.255 --> 01:20:26.775]  We're actually voting for Romney.
[01:20:27.895 --> 01:20:28.495]  That's a joke, too.
[01:20:28.696 --> 01:20:32.176]  You know, I mean, it is like cyanide or arsenic or some other poison.
[01:20:32.196 --> 01:20:36.197]  I mean, it really is just, you know, how does each candidate destroy you?
[01:20:37.277 --> 01:20:41.998]  What's your take, briefly, and then we're going to Max Keiser, David Knight, on what a Romney would do versus an Obama?
[01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:46.359]  Well, I agree with what you said earlier when you were talking to Gerald Cilenti.
[01:20:46.419 --> 01:20:57.481]  I think on the issues that concern me, war and peace, civil liberties, the destruction of due process, and the Constitution, I don't really see any difference between the two of them.
[01:20:58.041 --> 01:21:02.242]  But I think that people are going to be more awake if Romney stays in.
[01:21:02.262 --> 01:21:04.843]  Hopefully some people on the left.
[01:21:06.021 --> 01:21:06.502]  Sorry?
[01:21:07.102 --> 01:21:11.167]  So you're saying if Romney gets in it would wake up the left or Obama?
[01:21:11.207 --> 01:21:20.198]  No, I'm saying if Obama stays in, I think that it's going to keep people on the right more engaged and hopefully some people on the left will wake up.
[01:21:21.039 --> 01:21:23.202]  We've already seen some of that happening.
[01:21:23.722 --> 01:21:42.568]  Some people on the left are very upset about things that Obama has done, continuing the torture in Gitmo, having a kill list where he can, on his orders, kill American citizens abroad, the NDAA, that he lied back and forth about what he was going to do and then signed something that basically takes away our due process.
[01:21:42.968 --> 01:21:44.689]  So there are people on the left that are waking up.
[01:21:45.269 --> 01:21:50.811]  I'm just afraid that the people on the right are going to go totally asleep if Romney wins.
[01:21:51.738 --> 01:21:52.419]  Exactly.
[01:21:52.439 --> 01:21:54.802]  So we're damned if we do, damned if we don't.
[01:21:54.862 --> 01:21:56.623]  OK, David Knight, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:21:56.644 --> 01:21:57.184]  Great job.
[01:21:57.725 --> 01:21:59.547]  And again, I do plan to open the phones up.
[01:21:59.607 --> 01:22:02.510]  We plan to have more reports from the street as well.
[01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:06.274]  But Austin is predominantly Democrat, where we come to you from.
[01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:09.437]  So it's going to be mainly Obama supporters vomiting all over the place, drunk.
[01:22:11.079 --> 01:22:12.279]  Sorry, it's just ridiculous.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:18.161]  Let's go ahead and go to Max Keiser as part of our live coverage.
[01:22:18.181 --> 01:22:23.803]  I know it's late at night over there in Albion, Britannia, but he joins us.
[01:22:24.003 --> 01:22:29.605]  Max Keiser, it's election 2012 and I was flattered that we connected to your Skype.
[01:22:29.665 --> 01:22:30.185]  We can hear the
[01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.906]  The audio of the video and the background.
[01:22:32.946 --> 01:22:37.747]  We're flattered that you are following our coverage here of MaxKeiser.com.
[01:22:37.787 --> 01:22:39.348]  Max, there's so much going on.
[01:22:39.708 --> 01:22:48.851]  What is front and center right now in this selection on Max Keiser's radar TV host, former stockbroker, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange?
[01:22:49.151 --> 01:22:51.192]  What's your take on what's happening right now, Max Keiser?
[01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:59.051]  Well, I always look at how markets are trading to give me an idea of what the big money is doing, what the smart money is doing.
[01:23:00.272 --> 01:23:16.875]  And the stock market and the precious metals markets have been strong all day, indicating that the Obama win will bring in more gridlock and more quantitative easing, more money printing.
[01:23:17.675 --> 01:23:25.177]  If there was any chance at all that Romney would win, the markets would have sold off pretty sharply over the past couple of days.
[01:23:25.577 --> 01:23:31.999]  But they haven't, because there's never been less than a 55-60% chance that Obama would win, anywhere between 60-90% chance that he would win.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:40.501]  Betfair or Intrade or iPundit.
[01:23:40.521 --> 01:23:42.041]  These are all political markets.
[01:23:42.401 --> 01:23:44.242]  They've all called this for Obama.
[01:23:45.002 --> 01:23:48.783]  The Dow Jones, the gold market have all basically called this for Obama.
[01:23:49.303 --> 01:24:00.766]  So Romney's never really been in this race as far as the markets are concerned and since I've spent 25 years in the markets I kind of go with how they're going and that's that's the way it's been.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:13.005]  Now, if you want to talk about the big news after the election, it's going to be a busting of the biggest bubble in the history of the past 240 years.
[01:24:13.305 --> 01:24:23.229]  Did you know, Alex Jones, that in America for the past 238 years, during the entire time of the existence of the United States, that the U.S.
[01:24:23.249 --> 01:24:26.291]  10-year Treasury bond has never been higher?
[01:24:27.111 --> 01:24:30.013]  At 1.6% on the yield on the 10-year note.
[01:24:30.573 --> 01:24:36.776]  Yes, I did know that, because you have global quantitative easing, devaluation of currencies in a race to the bottom.
[01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:41.318]  So people fleeing into the dollar was not a sign of strength, but actually weakness.
[01:24:41.378 --> 01:24:44.920]  So Max Keiser is saying that the U.S.
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:47.741]  Treasuries are overvalued.
[01:24:47.761 --> 01:24:49.362]  I don't think anyone denies that.
[01:24:49.622 --> 01:24:52.004]  You get a tiny gain, but they're overvalued.
[01:24:52.024 --> 01:24:52.564]  What does that mean?
[01:24:53.476 --> 01:24:55.596]  Well, it's in a historic bubble.
[01:24:55.936 --> 01:25:05.558]  You'd have to go back to the tulip bulb bubble or other historic bubbles that are trading at these incredible overvaluations.
[01:25:06.098 --> 01:25:07.138]  And when this U.S.
[01:25:07.178 --> 01:25:19.300]  government bond bubble bursts, within now and the next six months, you know, I'm still sticking to my prediction of global paper apocalypse between now and the middle of April.
[01:25:19.841 --> 01:25:21.901]  So we're into the final six months.
[01:25:22.481 --> 01:25:27.245]  This prediction will cause more massive gridlock, more massive money printing.
[01:25:27.625 --> 01:25:40.116]  I'm here in the UK, where the economy is rolling over, where the government is throwing up its arms and basically throwing in the towel and giving up, where there's more problems every single day.
[01:25:40.756 --> 01:25:46.641]  Gold is making new highs against the British Pound, it's made new highs against the Euro, the Swiss Franc.
[01:25:47.822 --> 01:25:50.004]  So, as you know, I'm here to witness
[01:25:51.104 --> 01:26:01.567]  First hand, the collapse of the UK economy, because when the paper apocalypse comes, the nations with the most gold are going to be the ones that will survive.
[01:26:01.787 --> 01:26:06.949]  And the UK has less, well really only about 300 tons of gold.
[01:26:07.369 --> 01:26:10.610]  It's one of the lowest positions of gold of any of the G20 nations.
[01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:14.874]  The Eurozone, by the way, has over 12,000 tons.
[01:26:15.434 --> 01:26:17.617]  Italy's got over 2,400 tons.
[01:26:17.877 --> 01:26:20.520]  The UK has only 300 tons of gold.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:24.244]  That means that they're going to go to a gunfight with a pea shooter.
[01:26:24.505 --> 01:26:25.185]  They just don't have...
[01:26:27.687 --> 01:26:31.788]  And by the way, it's not just the Middle Eastern countries or Venezuela.
[01:26:31.848 --> 01:26:35.549]  A whole bunch of countries are demanding their gold back from the U.S.
[01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:36.370]  and England.
[01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:38.250]  What does that signify?
[01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:44.472]  That they think things are going to collapse so bad and things are going to go to different conflicts worldwide that they won't be able to get their gold back?
[01:26:45.299 --> 01:26:50.920]  Well, starting in 2009, Alex, the central banks around the world reversed a 30-year trend.
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:55.901]  They became buyers of gold, starting in 2009.
[01:26:56.001 --> 01:27:01.743]  Mexico has bought 2,000 percent, increased their gold reserves.
[01:27:02.123 --> 01:27:05.924]  Korea has increased their gold reserves by hundreds of percentage points.
[01:27:06.224 --> 01:27:10.064]  Here's how you know when the paper apocalypse is upon us, Alex.
[01:27:10.164 --> 01:27:12.065]  This is a very simple concept that
[01:27:13.165 --> 01:27:18.670]  Once it happens, it will cause seismic repercussions around the world.
[01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:23.213]  Central banks around the world right now, they print money to buy bonds.
[01:27:23.353 --> 01:27:25.455]  That's what a quantitative easing is all about.
[01:27:26.016 --> 01:27:32.160]  When this thing hits the fan, central banks will begin to print money to buy gold.
[01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.181]  That's the big difference.
[01:27:34.581 --> 01:27:37.042]  Central banks printing money to buy gold.
[01:27:37.722 --> 01:27:40.903]  Then you see gold trading at $5,000 an ounce overnight.
[01:27:41.363 --> 01:27:42.403]  That's when you see the U.S.
[01:27:42.443 --> 01:27:46.364]  Treasury bond get crushed by 50, 60, 70 percent in a week.
[01:27:46.964 --> 01:27:49.424]  That's what I'm talking about between now and April.
[01:27:54.125 --> 01:27:56.226]  Continue breaking that analysis down, Max.
[01:27:58.386 --> 01:28:13.093]  Well, it's just a matter of the central banks and the investment banks that do business with them have done nothing over the past five years of this crisis except expand
[01:28:13.613 --> 01:28:25.341]  The level of derivatives trading, they've expanded the complications of the interbank dealing and all of the unsound practices that they've been involved with.
[01:28:26.061 --> 01:28:35.788]  HSBC, the biggest bank in the UK, just got caught and they're being charged with another 500 million, half a billion, for money laundering for Mexico.
[01:28:35.828 --> 01:28:40.031]  That brings a 1.6 billion pound liability to HSBC.
[01:28:40.371 --> 01:28:41.552]  The LIBOR scandal.
[01:28:41.792 --> 01:28:43.554]  Biggest scandal in banking history.
[01:28:43.574 --> 01:28:46.517]  It affects 300 trillion dollars in securities.
[01:28:46.817 --> 01:28:50.741]  The lawsuits are piling up like tobacco and asbestos combined.
[01:28:51.161 --> 01:28:54.404]  The LIBOR scandal is going to completely decapitalize these banks.
[01:28:54.745 --> 01:29:04.334]  The Basel Committee in Switzerland is saying the banks must increase their working capital by billions, hundreds of billions of dollars at the same time that they're trying to pay down debt.
[01:29:04.634 --> 01:29:05.815]  So those two things are
[01:29:06.936 --> 01:29:08.377]  Completely opposed to each other.
[01:29:08.397 --> 01:29:16.023]  It doesn't add up except to a massive crash which we're heading into and this this election in the U.S.
[01:29:16.563 --> 01:29:17.264]  doesn't matter.
[01:29:17.324 --> 01:29:19.045]  You could put Mickey Mouse in the White House.
[01:29:19.385 --> 01:29:24.309]  It won't stop this paper apocalypse from hitting in the next six months.
[01:29:24.349 --> 01:29:26.671]  It just doesn't make it doesn't matter who you put in the White House.
[01:29:27.531 --> 01:29:29.613]  The freight train is at full speed.
[01:29:29.633 --> 01:29:31.094]  You can't stop it.
[01:29:35.245 --> 01:29:38.948]  Our guest is Max Keiser, and we've done quite a bit tonight.
[01:29:39.008 --> 01:29:42.170]  He's been with us another 20 minutes or so, maybe a little bit longer.
[01:29:42.190 --> 01:29:53.198]  I would like to open the phones up here to our phone system for people that want to report any voting anomalies, and we'll do that here in a few minutes.
[01:29:53.218 --> 01:30:00.163]  We also have reporters that are going to be on the ground in Austin, and our own David Knight and Jakari Jackson are going to be popping in with the latest updates.
[01:30:01.448 --> 01:30:10.314]  When I saw the bookies over the weekend in Ireland, in England, and even in Vegas by Monday, already paying out on Obama.
[01:30:10.974 --> 01:30:18.479]  When I'm looking at the Electoral College and I'm looking at the popular vote, Romney's winning popular, he's neck and neck in the Electoral College.
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.122]  Again, I mean quite frankly,
[01:30:23.528 --> 01:30:37.838]  Either way, I like the fact that Romney claims he's pro-gun and stuff, but I know that's all a bunch of talk, so I'm not a big enough schmuck or sucker or, you know, a rube or whatever word you use, you know, to sit here and fantasize about this.
[01:30:37.918 --> 01:30:41.200]  But, I mean, it's scary Obama calls war peace.
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.901]  I mean, it's scary he gets peace prizes.
[01:30:42.961 --> 01:30:45.583]  It's scary he says he's going to ban my handguns.
[01:30:46.303 --> 01:30:50.166]  It's scary, a lot of stuff, so I'm like, am I wrong not getting in this?
[01:30:50.226 --> 01:30:50.646]  Am I wrong?
[01:30:50.686 --> 01:30:52.748]  But then, you know, I pull back, but
[01:30:53.428 --> 01:31:04.559]  You know, it's easy to go in there and make bets that Obama's going to win to skew it if they're going to spend $6 billion on this election one way or the other, as the New York Times reported two days ago.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:11.205]  So, I mean, I don't think we can call this race yet, but, you know, Gerald Cilente, who I respect, he's been calling Obama.
[01:31:12.206 --> 01:31:15.709]  You've been calling Obama, who I respect for months, a show.
[01:31:16.049 --> 01:31:19.231]  I mean, more and more, I guess it's four more years of Obama.
[01:31:19.251 --> 01:31:20.452]  We're going to find out.
[01:31:20.492 --> 01:31:21.593]  I mean, nobody knows yet.
[01:31:22.053 --> 01:31:25.676]  It's neck and neck right now, but I mean, it's neck and neck like in a rigged casino.
[01:31:26.256 --> 01:31:29.379]  It's kind of like putting a carrot in front of a donkey to make him plow more.
[01:31:29.899 --> 01:31:33.602]  I mean, it's a riddle inside a smoke screen, inside a hall of mirrors.
[01:31:34.242 --> 01:31:40.066]  You know that we're getting our fortune told on the side of the highway via some gypsy card.
[01:31:40.387 --> 01:31:43.929]  So who knows what even reality is in this kingdom of lies.
[01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:51.375]  But you're saying explain as a former now retired top stockbroker inventor of virtual trading.
[01:31:54.175 --> 01:32:08.076]  I mean, describe in the technicals, Max Keiser, why the markets did this and why you're saying the markets, commodities, gold, silver, and other things going up, why that signifies a big win for the man who brought us the Obama phone.
[01:32:09.529 --> 01:32:14.612]  You're right in that bookies in Europe are paying out on an Obama win already.
[01:32:14.652 --> 01:32:16.173]  They started doing that yesterday.
[01:32:16.873 --> 01:32:22.016]  That's how certain they are of an Obama win, that they're paying out on those bets.
[01:32:22.636 --> 01:32:25.518]  I believe it was Patty Power or one of the other bookies.
[01:32:25.538 --> 01:32:27.019]  That was Patty Power and a bunch of others, yeah.
[01:32:27.799 --> 01:32:40.208]  Okay, so they're already paying out on this bet because the commodities markets, the gold market and the stock market to a large degree, they want more of the same.
[01:32:40.248 --> 01:32:41.709]  They want more quantitative easing.
[01:32:42.029 --> 01:32:44.371]  Romney, you know, the way he talks,
[01:32:44.631 --> 01:32:51.236]  Now, of course, when he gets into the White House, whether he would fulfill this promise or not, that's another story.
[01:32:51.256 --> 01:33:02.643]  But the way he was talking was that he would try to get America's fiscal house in order, that he would try to support the dollar, and that he would stop wasting money overseas.
[01:33:02.924 --> 01:33:07.547]  But, you know, that would be good for the dollar, and that would be potentially a negative for gold.
[01:33:07.947 --> 01:33:10.209]  But nobody in the gold market ever believed him.
[01:33:10.409 --> 01:33:11.771]  Goldman Sachs doesn't believe him.
[01:33:11.871 --> 01:33:18.597]  Nobody believes him because they kept bidding up the price of stocks and gold throughout this entire period, and none more so than today.
[01:33:18.637 --> 01:33:25.523]  You saw a massive rally in gold today, up 33 bucks at one point, because it's clear that Obama is going to
[01:33:26.164 --> 01:33:36.953]  Great, more gridlock, and there's going to be massive money printing, and there's going to be more of the same in this massive banking crisis, which has yet to show its final comeuppance.
[01:33:36.973 --> 01:33:45.740]  Because the system knows what Obama and his crew is going to do, so this signifies, uh-oh, this means the inflationary move
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:56.083]  It's not that Romney would even keep his promises, it's just they know the quantifiable power structure of Obama, and they're saying, OK, that means commodities are going to go up.
[01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:57.724]  Absolutely.
[01:33:57.984 --> 01:34:01.265]  And the markets are, you know, discounting mechanisms.
[01:34:01.585 --> 01:34:02.506]  We can say that.
[01:34:03.006 --> 01:34:11.169]  They are not necessarily prediction mechanisms, but the smart money, the big money, will definitely move prices.
[01:34:12.190 --> 01:34:35.831]  And as they move that money around and prices reflect where that money is going, you can see, for example, going back to the George Bush win, when he won the election, six months before George Bush won the first term, the tobacco stocks and the nuclear energy stocks all surged to new 52-week highs, because they knew that that's where this country was going.
[01:34:36.391 --> 01:34:36.671]  Okay.
[01:34:59.753 --> 01:35:04.775]  How did they know Obama was going to win when the wide spectrum of polls showed neck and neck?
[01:35:05.196 --> 01:35:07.217]  Does that lean towards the fix being in?
[01:35:08.417 --> 01:35:16.202]  No, the best poll is from Nate Silver, who looks purely at the statistics.
[01:35:16.642 --> 01:35:25.007]  And Nate Silver, I forget the name of his website, but he's been keeping Obama ahead of the Electoral College.
[01:35:25.307 --> 01:35:29.310]  Yeah, he's now saying 92% chance, and that's in the New York Times, Jesus.
[01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:37.136]  Right, so that's always been between 60 and 90%, and that's a poll, that's a guy who's completely independent.
[01:35:37.256 --> 01:35:38.737]  What do you expect Obama to do?
[01:35:38.757 --> 01:35:46.763]  Because one thing I don't like about Obama, and maybe it's just the power structure, because I know they're frontmen, but they are different CEOs of Slavery Incorporated.
[01:35:47.503 --> 01:36:06.346]  I mean, TSA was not trying to grab my huevos before Obama got in, but I mean, maybe that was just a coincidence, but I mean, if that trend continues, will there be full proctology exams and, you know, the TSA openly going after the, you know, I mean, our families?
[01:36:07.914 --> 01:36:13.917]  As far as, if you compare Obama in the context of civil rights, he's worse than Bush.
[01:36:14.317 --> 01:36:16.939]  I mean, that will give you an idea of how bad this guy is.
[01:36:17.759 --> 01:36:25.943]  You had the Obama deception film four years ago, and that was a very prescient film, and it was a very accurate film.
[01:36:26.264 --> 01:36:27.904]  Obama is a disaster.
[01:36:28.285 --> 01:36:30.306]  He's got to be one of the worst presidents ever.
[01:36:30.626 --> 01:36:32.467]  But it doesn't mean he's not going to win tonight.
[01:36:34.308 --> 01:36:36.609]  Because the establishment's happy with what he's doing.
[01:36:37.503 --> 01:36:43.125]  The establishment is making billions and billions of dollars on the back of Obama.
[01:36:43.805 --> 01:36:48.847]  Look, Wall Street's going to pay itself another $140 billion in bonuses this year.
[01:36:49.167 --> 01:36:52.128]  I'm sure it'll be a record year in bonuses.
[01:36:52.148 --> 01:36:57.810]  For every year of Obama's administration, give or take, they've always made out like bandits.
[01:36:58.170 --> 01:36:59.811]  So why would you vote against that?
[01:37:02.904 --> 01:37:05.887]  Well, Max, I'm here asking a lot of the questions.
[01:37:06.067 --> 01:37:11.411]  Max Keiser of the Keiser Report on RT, also BBC, you name it.
[01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:14.454]  I mean, he's got shows in England, he's got shows worldwide.
[01:37:15.715 --> 01:37:19.959]  Other points that I'm not bringing up that you think are important for the audience?
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:47.425]  This is a complete waste of everyone's time in the context of looking ahead to what's going to be the reality starting tomorrow and the next day, which is that the banks and the economies are crumbling rapidly and everything we've been saying is only picking up speed and the people need to be aware of that and position themselves and protect themselves and do the things we've been saying.
[01:37:47.685 --> 01:37:47.885]  Sure.
[01:37:47.925 --> 01:37:49.407]  I mean, people ask me this all the time.
[01:37:49.447 --> 01:37:58.095]  They say, Alex, if you say at the presidential level elections are a farce at this point, and it's a left-right paradigm, and the same globalists control both sides, which they write books about bragging.
[01:37:58.135 --> 01:37:58.935]  It's not my opinion.
[01:37:58.955 --> 01:38:00.116]  It's not like I'm saying this.
[01:38:00.477 --> 01:38:01.598]  People say, oh, how'd you know this?
[01:38:01.638 --> 01:38:02.318]  Well, they said it.
[01:38:02.359 --> 01:38:05.702]  I mean, they think we're so dumb they operate out in the open.
[01:38:05.862 --> 01:38:08.664]  And I guess in a way we are dumb because most people
[01:38:09.665 --> 01:38:11.027]  Don't care to even read a newspaper.
[01:38:11.067 --> 01:38:16.114]  I saw a national study two weeks ago that 23% read newspapers, period.
[01:38:16.134 --> 01:38:17.736]  I mean, at any time.
[01:38:17.856 --> 01:38:18.917]  Others don't even touch them.
[01:38:19.158 --> 01:38:22.622]  And that's a whole other level of propaganda, even if you read the newspaper.
[01:38:22.662 --> 01:38:25.706]  But the general public is just totally unaware of what's going on.
[01:38:26.647 --> 01:38:29.468]  People say then, why are you covering the election if it's a farce?
[01:38:29.528 --> 01:38:31.829]  Well, I'm honest about that.
[01:38:33.130 --> 01:38:47.576]  I can sit there and hang out my shingle and say, we're covering the election, and get everybody in the Matrix to tune in, and not just the choir, and then I can say, by the way, the whole thing's a fraud, and show how it's all controlled.
[01:38:47.656 --> 01:38:49.577]  I mean, you know, it's really that simple.
[01:38:49.597 --> 01:38:52.939]  People are like, well, why'd you do an Obama deception if both sides are controlled?
[01:38:53.399 --> 01:38:55.741]  Well, the Obama deception shows that!
[01:38:56.221 --> 01:39:05.748]  We just used the cult of Obama, when he was, you know, 90% approval rating, God incarnate, to show people the fraud he would be, which has now been proven.
[01:39:06.848 --> 01:39:11.252]  It's just that... Here's my problem, Max, because I am...
[01:39:12.558 --> 01:39:12.918]  I don't
[01:39:28.965 --> 01:39:33.947]  And all these groups attacking me and doing things behind the scenes.
[01:39:34.487 --> 01:39:40.829]  So all I know is they've put me in the Republican gang even if I'm not part of that gang.
[01:39:40.889 --> 01:39:41.989]  I'm part of the Freedom Gang.
[01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.849]  I want freedom.
[01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:44.230]  I don't like corruption.
[01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:46.310]  I don't think it's cute to be an insider.
[01:39:46.330 --> 01:39:49.491]  I want to make it on my own, and I want to empower others.
[01:39:50.071 --> 01:39:51.332]  So what do I do?
[01:39:51.392 --> 01:40:02.854]  Because the word I've gotten is that the Justice Department and the rest of those fast and furious criminals are going to really try to cinch things up, which is what the power structure wants.
[01:40:02.914 --> 01:40:04.175]  It's not just because they're Democrats.
[01:40:04.675 --> 01:40:09.976]  I've just found that the Democrats are a very authoritarian crew at the top.
[01:40:11.815 --> 01:40:20.725]  Well, you know, as bad as it is in the States, for the reasons and everything you've just described, it's actually, in some ways, a lot worse in a country like Ireland.
[01:40:20.845 --> 01:40:22.567]  Now, I was listening to Gerald Solente.
[01:40:22.587 --> 01:40:23.908]  He's in Ireland.
[01:40:23.988 --> 01:40:25.730]  I just came back from a week in Ireland.
[01:40:26.710 --> 01:40:29.712]  And in Ireland, the situation is worse.
[01:40:29.752 --> 01:40:32.614]  They only have one broadcaster, RTE.
[01:40:32.754 --> 01:40:37.678]  It's like a state-sponsored, TV-licensed sponsored broadcaster.
[01:40:38.278 --> 01:40:42.001]  And all they do all day is report on farm conditions and the weather.
[01:40:42.522 --> 01:40:54.070]  Even though that you've got guys like Noonan, who was mentioned earlier, or you've got banking guys like Sean Fitzpatrick and others, who have stolen billions and hundreds of billions of euros from the country.
[01:40:54.510 --> 01:40:59.353]  The media doesn't even mention that in any context at any time.
[01:40:59.454 --> 01:41:01.455]  It's a complete blank slate.
[01:41:01.535 --> 01:41:02.395]  It's not even mentioned.
[01:41:02.435 --> 01:41:04.337]  So the people have been abandoned by the media.
[01:41:04.597 --> 01:41:06.058]  They've been abandoned by the banks.
[01:41:06.458 --> 01:41:07.939]  The Catholic Church has abandoned them.
[01:41:07.959 --> 01:41:15.644]  There's a huge scandal in Ireland where the Irish government has closed down their embassy at the Vatican as part of a huge scandal.
[01:41:15.984 --> 01:41:17.685]  So they've lost their church.
[01:41:17.966 --> 01:41:19.807]  They've lost their banks.
[01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:21.108]  They've lost their media.
[01:41:21.128 --> 01:41:22.969]  They've been completely abandoned.
[01:41:23.029 --> 01:41:28.213]  These people are just wandering around from county to county not knowing what to do.
[01:41:28.513 --> 01:41:43.565]  Now in America, still, you've got outlets like yourself, you've got other people that at least have some alternative voice, but in some of these other countries like Ireland and down in Greece, you know, it's just really unbelievable.
[01:41:44.105 --> 01:41:52.193]  At this point, did you know out of 170 plus countries that Alexa.com, the web rating system, guess where this show is normally number one?
[01:41:52.233 --> 01:41:55.135]  It's actually number two right now because of the election.
[01:41:55.155 --> 01:41:56.857]  We're getting even more visitors from the U.S.
[01:41:57.197 --> 01:42:03.103]  We are consistently, for a decade, my biggest audience per capita is Ireland.
[01:42:03.503 --> 01:42:08.508]  So they, I mean, they understand that they've got to go outside to get news and information.
[01:42:09.602 --> 01:42:20.785]  Well, I think, I've said on your show many times that the, you know, what I call the global insurrection against banks, banker occupation, the front line is in Athens and Dublin.
[01:42:21.025 --> 01:42:34.128]  And I believe that we should have, and I'm there myself, but there should be permanent reporters from your organization and others in Dublin, in Athens, who are reporting on the global insurrection so that
[01:42:34.608 --> 01:42:35.890]  I agree, folks.
[01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:41.737]  We don't have the capital, but we can vet good reporters in Athens and in Dublin, not just have max nominees there.
[01:42:42.097 --> 01:42:50.448]  We need to get correspondents there who can talk about what it's like to really be under the glove of us, because they're two or three years ahead of us.
[01:42:51.058 --> 01:42:51.218]  Right.
[01:42:51.278 --> 01:42:54.180]  It would help the people there, give them real assistance.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:57.382]  It would also help people in America see what the future is going to look like.
[01:42:57.422 --> 01:43:02.805]  Because the U.S., as we've said before, is insulated to some degree because they have the U.S.
[01:43:02.866 --> 01:43:12.011]  dollar, which is the world reserve currency, which means that even in today's environment, the price of food and energy on a relative basis are a lot cheaper than other places of the world.
[01:43:12.031 --> 01:43:15.994]  So America has a good, quote-unquote, compared to Greece, obviously.
[01:43:16.014 --> 01:43:17.595]  We're exporting our inflation.
[01:43:18.914 --> 01:43:23.959]  All kinds of nasty bits are going back and forth, and benefits that come with having the World Reserve currency.
[01:43:23.999 --> 01:43:30.325]  But in two or three's time, the benefit of having that currency will collapse as all of the paper money collapses.
[01:43:31.006 --> 01:43:35.970]  I saw a number that the per capita government and private debt in the U.S.
[01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:42.737]  is the highest in the world of any industrialized country, and was something like 30 percent, it's in my stack, worse than Greece.
[01:43:43.567 --> 01:43:44.248]  What do they call it?
[01:43:44.268 --> 01:43:46.670]  They call that the fiscal cliff, right?
[01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:50.953]  After the election, there's going to be a discussion about, what about this fiscal cliff?
[01:43:51.273 --> 01:44:11.969]  So this is what Ireland had to deal with three years ago, when the government, on behalf of the people, assumed 100% of one bank's liabilities, Anglo-Irish, and took the country from having no deficit, no structural deficit, no problem paying any of the welfare programs, to being hundreds of billions, or two or three times their GDP in debt!
[01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:13.150]  That happened in one week!
[01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:29.362]  Max, let me erase that for people because they do this Svengali move, this mind control move, where four and a half years ago, October 2008, it was admitted that 90 plus percent of this debt we were signing on to was derivatives fraud, not the people's debt.
[01:44:29.802 --> 01:44:40.811]  Same thing in Iceland, same thing that you reported on live from, same thing in Ireland, same thing in Greece, same thing, you know, it's 87 percent is not their debt in Spain, Portugal,
[01:44:41.511 --> 01:44:50.539]  But then by now the media's like, you're lazy and dumb, you need to work seven days a week, we're taking your pension fund, you scum, you're the reason we're in debt.
[01:44:50.779 --> 01:45:00.527]  And I'm like, excuse me, they admit right here this isn't the Irish people's debt, this isn't the Icelanders' debt, this isn't the Greeks' debt, this isn't the Spanish debt.
[01:45:02.048 --> 01:45:04.049]  Talk about perishing for lack of knowledge.
[01:45:04.369 --> 01:45:05.690]  They're criminal governments.
[01:45:06.230 --> 01:45:07.711]  Sign them on to the bankers.
[01:45:08.071 --> 01:45:10.413]  Give their tax money to the bankers to bail them out.
[01:45:10.833 --> 01:45:21.799]  The bankers come back and say, well, now because you gave us all this money, you're in debt to us on that money, and we're going to shut everything down to increase your taxes to pay us more.
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:25.602]  I mean, I'm like, hey, how about your ass gets thrown in prison?
[01:45:25.622 --> 01:45:26.202]  How's that sound?
[01:45:26.857 --> 01:45:40.811]  Well, the debt that they're paying to this bank, Anglo-Irish, is by definition unsecured debt, which means that if there's inability of the debtor to pay, then the creditor has to accept their losses.
[01:45:42.232 --> 01:45:49.379]  It's not even a secure debt, it's an unsecured debt, and they're still going to be paying off billions of euros on an unsecured debt.
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:59.932]  Do they sign me up for banks derivatives crap too big to fail and then turn around and tell me I'm lazy and need to pay these bastard banks more money?
[01:46:00.618 --> 01:46:03.639]  Okay, so that's Ireland is basically their goose is cooked.
[01:46:03.859 --> 01:46:05.619]  Now let's look at the UK for a second.
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:08.880]  What is the debt-to-GDP ratio in the UK?
[01:46:09.121 --> 01:46:18.823]  Well, if you add up the national debt, the personal debt, and the debt on the bank's balance sheet, the UK, Britain, has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 900%.
[01:46:21.204 --> 01:46:22.826]  Which is incredibly high.
[01:46:22.986 --> 01:46:25.669]  It's about where Iceland was before Iceland blew up.
[01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:28.992]  And there's no way that Britain can pay off this debt.
[01:46:29.152 --> 01:46:34.257]  That's why the British pound and the British economy is Iceland on steroids.
[01:46:34.317 --> 01:46:36.880]  They're just walking into a machete.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:38.501]  That's why I'm here.
[01:46:38.521 --> 01:46:44.808]  I'm going to cover this live because this is going to be the most spectacular flameout we've seen in 50 years or more.
[01:46:47.093 --> 01:46:47.674]  The U.S.
[01:46:47.874 --> 01:46:49.195]  is not much better.
[01:46:49.355 --> 01:46:58.125]  I mean, they've got huge problems, but they have the military, they've got the Pentagon, they've got the ability to launch wars.
[01:46:58.285 --> 01:47:02.289]  Got some nuclear weapons and a bunch of high-tech propaganda, but let's expand on that.
[01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:09.436]  I know I stated it, but I want you and your expert terms to explain how, because I've seen the numbers even in the news.
[01:47:10.277 --> 01:47:13.718]  On average, 90% or so of the debt is the banksters.
[01:47:14.378 --> 01:47:23.761]  How do they transmute it like alchemy onto our debt and then lecture us about how great they are all day and how great it is to be run by their unelected technocrats?
[01:47:24.101 --> 01:47:26.582]  Well, you had a case study in this back in 2008.
[01:47:26.902 --> 01:47:34.604]  Remember, Hank Paulson went in front of Congress during the crisis and he said, you need to give us three quarters of a trillion dollars to save your bank, the banking system.
[01:47:34.824 --> 01:47:40.047]  That means you need to guarantee three-quarters of a trillion dollars to bail out Goldman Sachs and Wall Street.
[01:47:40.427 --> 01:47:43.950]  And Congress said, wait a minute, that sounds preposterous, you know, we're not going to do it.
[01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:45.130]  Well, what did they do?
[01:47:45.150 --> 01:47:49.493]  The next day, Hank Paulson hit the sell button and with program trading and
[01:47:52.654 --> 01:47:53.074]  We're good to go.
[01:48:17.643 --> 01:48:25.909]  Due to market conditions, it's a market crash that is orchestrated by market participants to affect a political outcome.
[01:48:25.929 --> 01:48:37.879]  Yeah, so they're holding us hostage, and as you point out, you knew people that kept trading in the towers at places you worked, even though they knew it was probably going to kill them, who died to make extra money.
[01:48:37.919 --> 01:48:40.381]  So these bankers can't stop doing this.
[01:48:40.681 --> 01:48:44.464]  So where does it lead us if they hold us hostage into oblivion?
[01:48:47.119 --> 01:48:56.583]  I don't think there is any way out of it because there's nothing at this point anyone can do to stop the inertia, the momentum.
[01:48:56.623 --> 01:49:03.766]  And so you have to look after this global crash and decide where you want to be after the crash.
[01:49:03.846 --> 01:49:07.508]  For me, I want to be with as much gold and silver as possible.
[01:49:07.688 --> 01:49:16.857]  But there's got to be no way that anyone or any organization or any government or any group of government is going to be able to come together and stop this from happening.
[01:49:16.877 --> 01:49:19.820]  Yeah, there's no way we're not going into increased inflation.
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.481]  They can manipulate it for a while.
[01:49:21.541 --> 01:49:22.843]  They can play games with paper.
[01:49:23.724 --> 01:49:26.987]  That's why I bought gold at two hundred and something dollars an ounce, never sold it.
[01:49:27.247 --> 01:49:28.829]  That's why I bought silver at five dollars.
[01:49:29.609 --> 01:49:32.531]  Let me just go back and review a fundamental point here.
[01:49:32.571 --> 01:49:47.082]  The central banks, which are the repositories of the biggest hordes of cash and credit in the world, starting in 2009, they stopped being sellers of gold and they started being buyers of gold.
[01:49:47.302 --> 01:49:49.264]  Because they don't trust each other.
[01:49:49.284 --> 01:49:55.729]  And when you lose the confidence, you lose everything that keeps the fiat money afloat.
[01:49:56.229 --> 01:50:03.192]  The trend for central banks, including China, which is the world's biggest gold miner, they're the biggest gold buyer.
[01:50:03.212 --> 01:50:06.054]  A couple of things are going to happen that are going to kick this off.
[01:50:06.154 --> 01:50:13.778]  China's going to announce probably at the end, beginning of next year, that as of the end of this year, their reserves, gold reserves, have gone from $1,000
[01:50:14.738 --> 01:50:17.099]  So that's the trigger for the race to the exits?
[01:50:43.723 --> 01:50:45.844]  Okay, let me just give people some breaking news here.
[01:50:46.225 --> 01:50:50.887]  Romney takes early electoral vote lead with Ohio and Virginia too close to call.
[01:50:51.288 --> 01:50:55.490]  Mitt Romney has carried West Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky.
[01:50:56.031 --> 01:50:57.472]  Fox News projects.
[01:50:57.512 --> 01:50:59.093]  That means Karl Rove projects.
[01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:02.755]  New Jersey email voting suffers major glitches.
[01:51:02.775 --> 01:51:04.896]  Deadline extended to Friday.
[01:51:06.497 --> 01:51:07.818]  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:07.838 --> 01:51:11.500]  They are now extending the election, though the media may just call it.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.662]  I mean, we are entering hyper bizarro.
[01:51:13.702 --> 01:51:14.662]  That is NBC News.
[01:51:15.142 --> 01:51:19.425]  Bloomberg suggests partial evacuation ahead of a new storm.
[01:51:19.465 --> 01:51:20.546]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[01:51:21.286 --> 01:51:23.488]  The big Nor'easter coming in.
[01:51:23.548 --> 01:51:25.069]  Boy, this is really biblical.
[01:51:25.269 --> 01:51:27.110]  The storm, another storm.
[01:51:27.130 --> 01:51:27.650]  I mean...
[01:51:29.111 --> 01:51:31.532]  I mean, get ready for some crazy, crazy times.
[01:51:32.633 --> 01:51:34.874]  Taking photos of your ballot is illegal in Illinois.
[01:51:34.894 --> 01:51:36.774]  You're not supposed to show the electronic fraud.
[01:51:37.215 --> 01:51:38.515]  Everybody's pointing out.
[01:51:39.115 --> 01:51:45.398]  And we've got gold oil surge, other commodities, post gains as ballots cast in major presidential election.
[01:51:45.438 --> 01:51:47.019]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:51:47.319 --> 01:51:48.580]  Hey, you want to talk to Max Keiser?
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:51.841]  We've only got him about 15 more minutes out of David Knight in a report.
[01:51:51.861 --> 01:51:52.962]  And then we're going to have
[01:51:54.235 --> 01:51:59.599]  Wayne Madsen joining us as well as Paul Craig Roberts, Lou Rockwell, and many others.
[01:51:59.659 --> 01:52:00.900]  Ron Paul is on Friday.
[01:52:01.821 --> 01:52:04.282]  Jesse Ventura tomorrow during the main radio show.
[01:52:04.302 --> 01:52:08.165]  Again, I want to thank all our guests and the crew and all you the viewers out there.
[01:52:08.506 --> 01:52:12.368]  But here's the toll-free number to join us, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:52:12.388 --> 01:52:12.689]  877-789-2539.
[01:52:13.409 --> 01:52:16.291]  Did you see election fraud?
[01:52:16.311 --> 01:52:18.053]  Or do you have a quick comment on what's happening?
[01:52:18.833 --> 01:52:20.394]  This is too early to tell.
[01:52:20.534 --> 01:52:22.276]  It's all a bunch of fraud anyway, so
[01:52:22.856 --> 01:52:28.039]  You know, they're telling us it's like the roulette wheel in Vegas.
[01:52:28.099 --> 01:52:29.680]  I mean, how do you know it's not staged?
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.402]  Because Don Carleone told you it wasn't.
[01:52:32.722 --> 01:52:33.883]  How do you know that's your daddy?
[01:52:33.903 --> 01:52:35.164]  Because your mama told you so.
[01:52:35.684 --> 01:52:37.545]  How do you know Aspartame is good for you?
[01:52:37.565 --> 01:52:39.726]  Because Monsanto told you so.
[01:52:39.746 --> 01:52:40.947]  Enjoy that brain tumor.
[01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:43.629]  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:43.649 --> 01:52:44.029]  877-789-2539.
[01:52:44.049 --> 01:52:44.890]  MaxKaiser.com is the website.
[01:52:48.972 --> 01:52:52.394]  Of our guest, and Max, what time is it over there in Britannia?
[01:52:52.434 --> 01:52:52.935]  What is it like?
[01:52:53.015 --> 01:52:53.395]  Midnight?
[01:52:53.475 --> 01:52:53.975]  One in the morning?
[01:52:54.816 --> 01:52:59.719]  It's time for everyone listening to your show to start following me on Twitter.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:01.300]  I agree.
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:01.940]  Give us your Twitter.
[01:53:03.922 --> 01:53:06.143]  It's Max Keiser is my Twitter handle.
[01:53:06.163 --> 01:53:08.665]  Listen, I don't know how Twitter works.
[01:53:09.265 --> 01:53:09.966]  Max Keiser.
[01:53:10.006 --> 01:53:11.667]  K-E-I-S-E-R.
[01:53:11.687 --> 01:53:13.168]  You must follow me on Twitter.
[01:53:13.388 --> 01:53:14.989]  That is part of the salvation.
[01:53:15.825 --> 01:53:19.406]  Listen, all I know is, I didn't get onto Twitter and Facebook until a lot later.
[01:53:20.287 --> 01:53:23.048]  And, you know, I... You've got 100,000 followers or more.
[01:53:23.188 --> 01:53:24.568]  I've only got like 37,000.
[01:53:25.049 --> 01:53:33.072]  I want to be... If I get over Alex Jones and the number of followers in the next week, I will give away 20 silver ounces to whoever gets me over that number.
[01:53:34.713 --> 01:53:37.053]  Anyways, listen, I hope you get 50 million followers.
[01:53:37.073 --> 01:53:40.035]  My whole point is, is that
[01:53:42.478 --> 01:53:53.106]  I'm sitting here and we need everybody to go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter as well and sign up for that because we're getting censored on Facebook and on YouTube, not on Twitter yet.
[01:53:53.326 --> 01:53:58.830]  I need something where I don't have to send out emails to everybody and that gets blocked by spam filters.
[01:53:58.951 --> 01:54:05.896]  I need people to be on that so when I'm out there at live reports or need to get something out, twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[01:54:06.436 --> 01:54:08.938]  Anytime you get to some game late, it's not good.
[01:54:08.958 --> 01:54:11.160]  I don't know how I can put an article on InfoWars.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:12.742]  I think the word you're looking for is actively.
[01:54:32.552 --> 01:54:32.992]  Actively.
[01:54:33.153 --> 01:54:33.953]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:54:33.973 --> 01:54:38.997]  You know, let me just tell you something which you don't really understand this.
[01:54:39.317 --> 01:54:40.358]  I have to break it down for you.
[01:54:40.898 --> 01:54:45.721]  People in Ireland, as I explained it to you, they are in a media vacuum.
[01:54:46.262 --> 01:54:52.726]  You, Alex Jones, wherever you go in Ireland, you can go to a farming town with only 20 people
[01:54:53.667 --> 01:54:55.088]  And they know Alex Jones.
[01:54:55.168 --> 01:54:56.309]  People listen to you.
[01:54:56.569 --> 01:54:58.790]  You see the numbers on Alexa.
[01:54:58.830 --> 01:55:00.251]  That's not a freak accident.
[01:55:00.611 --> 01:55:02.672]  You are huge in Ireland.
[01:55:02.732 --> 01:55:04.353]  You are huge in the UK.
[01:55:04.413 --> 01:55:06.194]  You are huge in the English-speaking world.
[01:55:07.515 --> 01:55:12.098]  There's got to be a way to leverage that as far as fighting back against the banksters.
[01:55:12.358 --> 01:55:19.564]  You know, you're thinking in the bubble of America, and America is the last country to go under because of the reserve dollar.
[01:55:20.104 --> 01:55:28.831]  You can build out that army of supporters in these other countries, and it'll give you more firepower to go against the banksters.
[01:55:29.392 --> 01:55:30.853]  In my opinion, that's just my opinion.
[01:55:31.674 --> 01:55:34.656]  Max, all I want to do is defeat the globalists.
[01:55:34.676 --> 01:55:35.177]  Tell me how.
[01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:46.094]  Well, in Ireland, it sounds like you're setting yourself up to have a lot more coverage with reporters in different countries and things, and that sounds fantastic.
[01:55:46.154 --> 01:55:53.858]  If you had permanently somebody in Dublin and somebody in Athens and somebody in a couple of other key countries, then
[01:55:55.078 --> 01:56:01.901]  What becomes clear is that this global banking crisis, this global insurrection against Bankster, is something everyone shares around the world.
[01:56:01.981 --> 01:56:09.405]  Canada, Australia, you know, certainly in the English-speaking world is the obvious connecting of all these countries.
[01:56:09.705 --> 01:56:19.009]  But, you know, all it takes is a couple of reporters from these places to report how, like HSBC, or the LIBOR scandals global, the money laundering
[01:56:19.269 --> 01:56:23.892]  Scandal from HSBC with Mexico, and now it's huge, hundred billions of dollars.
[01:56:23.912 --> 01:56:24.973]  So this is all connected.
[01:56:25.033 --> 01:56:28.255]  So it all can go through the headquarters in there in Austin.
[01:56:28.296 --> 01:56:32.058]  You know, you're the global nexus of all this, and you already are.
[01:56:32.298 --> 01:56:35.601]  I'm just saying that, hey, you know, there's a people out there in Ireland
[01:56:35.981 --> 01:56:38.964]  Who already are looking to you to get their news.
[01:56:39.525 --> 01:56:43.889]  So, you know, maybe bring out a couple of reporters as you've done in the US.
[01:56:43.949 --> 01:56:49.515]  Maybe bring a couple on from these other countries to give it that global, global footprint.
[01:56:50.336 --> 01:56:57.239]  No, I agree, but I'm just a regular guy trying to keep basic operations here and build our central network, but I agree.
[01:56:57.259 --> 01:57:00.340]  I mean, I would just say to everybody... Because this guy Watson, right?
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:01.741]  Watson is in the UK.
[01:57:01.781 --> 01:57:02.941]  He's got the UK covered.
[01:57:03.101 --> 01:57:06.783]  You need a Watson-type guy in Dublin and one in Athens.
[01:57:07.003 --> 01:57:07.704]  That's my final suggestion.
[01:57:07.904 --> 01:57:08.324]  I agree.
[01:57:08.344 --> 01:57:09.705]  We've had some of the groups on from there.
[01:57:09.765 --> 01:57:10.446]  They're great people.
[01:57:10.866 --> 01:57:11.847]  No, but I agree with you.
[01:57:12.387 --> 01:57:14.769]  We're all under the same tyranny.
[01:57:14.789 --> 01:57:17.991]  I want to go to some calls here in the last 10 minutes with Max Keiser.
[01:57:18.011 --> 01:57:21.514]  We're going to go to an update with David Knight and some of our reporters on the ground.
[01:57:22.154 --> 01:57:25.857]  Let's go to Labolis in Florida.
[01:57:25.877 --> 01:57:26.457]  You're on the air.
[01:57:26.477 --> 01:57:28.539]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:28.619 --> 01:57:29.299]  It's Labolis.
[01:57:30.453 --> 01:57:38.299]  You know, I reported today on my show, I saw some really underhanded stuff at my polling place.
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:57.795]  You've got the poll workers wearing Obama campaign t-shirts, coffee mugs, and you know, I go up to get my ballot and they want my photo ID and proof of residence and everything else, but
[01:57:58.533 --> 01:58:03.155]  There's several black people that come up behind me and they don't ask them for any of that.
[01:58:06.077 --> 01:58:08.798]  We're seeing reports of retail fraud everywhere.
[01:58:10.979 --> 01:58:21.804]  You know, they've got the markers outside the polling place, you know, showing here in Florida you can't have any campaign material within 100 feet of the polling place.
[01:58:22.725 --> 01:58:24.746]  And, you know, you walk in
[01:58:26.227 --> 01:58:30.529]  In my precinct anyway, and you know, here's all this Obama stuff.
[01:58:33.210 --> 01:58:35.972]  Tell me your precinct, because that would be national news.
[01:58:36.592 --> 01:58:39.013]  Poll workers in Obama outfits.
[01:58:40.614 --> 01:58:42.915]  It's District 14.
[01:58:46.576 --> 01:58:47.677]  District 14 where?
[01:58:49.338 --> 01:58:50.138]  In Hillsborough County.
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:57.505]  In Hillsborough County, Florida, there are people running things wearing Obama outfits.
[01:58:58.145 --> 01:59:02.189]  It was in the Houston Chronicle that the NAACP is running the polls there.
[01:59:03.850 --> 01:59:11.916]  And it is also in the news that they have the new Black Panther Party in Philadelphia there with baseball bats like last time.
[01:59:12.997 --> 01:59:13.938]  Pretty amazing.
[01:59:14.438 --> 01:59:16.340]  I tell you, man, this country's in a lot of trouble.
[01:59:17.467 --> 01:59:24.333]  I've also seen other reports in other cities.
[01:59:24.953 --> 01:59:30.678]  I think Chicago was one where one of the judges there was wearing his Obama ball cap.
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:33.120]  Unbelievable.
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:42.709]  Well listen, all I can say is I would videotape something like that by hook or by crook because that needs to be exposed and I'm not saying you're lying, it's just
[01:59:44.494 --> 01:59:46.616]  It's just unbelievable that this is all going on.
[01:59:46.656 --> 01:59:49.037]  Thank you for the call, labelists.
[01:59:49.378 --> 01:59:51.239]  Max Keiser, any comments on what he just said?
[01:59:51.979 --> 01:59:52.440]  Yeah, sure.
[01:59:52.660 --> 02:00:01.366]  As far as voting fraud goes in the United States, why would anyone be surprised that the basic tenet of democracy voting is totally corrupt?
[02:00:01.406 --> 02:00:04.048]  Look at the other metrics of how America's doing.
[02:00:04.989 --> 02:00:08.711]  On the competitiveness table, America has just crashed down.
[02:00:08.732 --> 02:00:10.393]  It's not even in the top 10.
[02:00:10.653 --> 02:00:11.854]  It's not in the top 15.
[02:00:12.114 --> 02:00:12.554]  It's number 17.
[02:00:13.775 --> 02:00:15.596]  In terms of competitiveness in the world.
[02:00:15.877 --> 02:00:18.818]  On the human rights front, they passed NDAA.
[02:00:19.059 --> 02:00:21.280]  Total Abolishment of Human Rights.
[02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:23.361]  How are they doing on the Gini Coefficient?
[02:00:23.422 --> 02:00:28.525]  Which is the measure of the wealth gap between the richest and the poorest.
[02:00:28.845 --> 02:00:30.866]  Well, according to this number, the U.S.
[02:00:30.926 --> 02:00:32.207]  is doing quite poorly as well.
[02:00:32.307 --> 02:00:33.528]  Crashing down that table.
[02:00:33.748 --> 02:00:34.769]  How about press freedom?
[02:00:34.869 --> 02:00:39.052]  Well, according to Reporters Without Borders, press freedom in America is crashing.
[02:00:39.412 --> 02:00:52.077]  So, if all the basic measures of a democracy and of a thriving society are all crashing, why would we expect the polling institution to be any less corrupt and any less pathetic?
[02:00:52.217 --> 02:00:53.978]  Of course it's going to be equally pathetic.
[02:00:54.158 --> 02:00:56.299]  Every institution in the country is crashing.
[02:00:57.419 --> 02:00:59.140]  And everything's gang mentality.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.981]  You know, as long as your gang's winning.
[02:01:01.241 --> 02:01:02.601]  Let's talk to Jerry in New York.
[02:01:02.621 --> 02:01:03.702]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:01:05.486 --> 02:01:06.166]  Yeah, hey, how are you?
[02:01:06.547 --> 02:01:10.490]  Hey buddy, thank you for joining us during special Puppet Election coverage.
[02:01:12.111 --> 02:01:13.832]  Yeah, I've been listening to you for years.
[02:01:14.893 --> 02:01:15.993]  You're the best.
[02:01:16.674 --> 02:01:22.318]  Max Keiser, he kind of has the same perspective as Gilles Valente.
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:26.281]  He says there will be a bubble.
[02:01:28.482 --> 02:01:32.045]  What's your take on the relationship between Iran, America, and Israel?
[02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:40.812]  And what do you think, when do you think precisely will it turn into effect after the election?
[02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:48.395]  Because there's a hold on by Benjamin Netanyahu to attempt to do something.
[02:01:48.515 --> 02:01:49.035]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:01:49.075 --> 02:01:53.657]  The deal was made that they would strike Iran after the election.
[02:01:53.697 --> 02:01:59.799]  We were also told by a lot of our sources they would stage a fake enrichment hold announcement.
[02:01:59.839 --> 02:02:01.420]  That did happen, Max Keiser.
[02:02:02.935 --> 02:02:07.216]  Well, the countries with the independent oil supplies are vulnerable.
[02:02:07.256 --> 02:02:17.299]  We saw it in Iraq, we see it in Iran, and that's when you have the global oil business dominated by Exxon and others, these countries are vulnerable.
[02:02:17.799 --> 02:02:21.861]  And so, if in fact they can
[02:02:22.941 --> 02:02:23.982]  Plausibly get in there.
[02:02:24.002 --> 02:02:35.068]  Remember when they went into Iraq it was going to be, it was going to cost something like 20 or 30 billion dollars and the invasion would pay for itself from the oil revenues from those oil fields.
[02:02:35.388 --> 02:02:44.633]  Well, a million innocent lives later and two trillion dollars later, you know, they're finally now starting maybe to get something back.
[02:02:44.673 --> 02:02:49.135]  But of course a lot of that's now going to foreign competitors and not even to the US.
[02:02:49.155 --> 02:02:53.817]  I mean, I talked to so many good old boys who said, Alex, we need the oil, shut up.
[02:02:54.217 --> 02:02:54.997]  I'm like, idiot.
[02:02:55.557 --> 02:03:00.239]  If they'll kill a million Iraqis to get this, you're not going to get the oil, Jack.
[02:03:01.319 --> 02:03:01.900]  And I went further.
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:07.642]  I said, you know they were mad at Saddam in 1990 because he was over-pumping to pay off his debts, driving down prices.
[02:03:08.062 --> 02:03:08.802]  OPEC was mad.
[02:03:09.122 --> 02:03:12.904]  You know the bankers will make more money restricting oil.
[02:03:13.324 --> 02:03:14.965]  You do get artificial scarcity.
[02:03:15.285 --> 02:03:15.685]  And you'd hear,
[02:03:16.425 --> 02:03:19.746]  You know, crickets chirping in the background.
[02:03:19.986 --> 02:03:21.366]  People just don't get it.
[02:03:21.826 --> 02:03:29.828]  They don't get that Obama can make more money shutting down coal power plants not owned by General Electric so they can double charge people.
[02:03:30.188 --> 02:03:32.169]  There's more than one way to take over.
[02:03:32.869 --> 02:03:36.250]  And people just don't get this new economy of total piracy.
[02:03:37.373 --> 02:03:49.304]  Well, getting back to the banking end of this, of course, you have the Saddam Hussein was going to price the oil in euros and not dollars, so that freaked people out.
[02:03:49.624 --> 02:03:54.549]  Iran wanted to price their energy resources in euros.
[02:03:55.150 --> 02:03:59.774]  That precipitated, you know, and endangered and inflamed the conflict.
[02:04:00.074 --> 02:04:03.217]  You know, and going back, you know, you haven't mentioned Libya at all.
[02:04:03.237 --> 02:04:03.537]  All right.
[02:04:18.274 --> 02:04:25.401]  Which, you know, it makes a lot of sense for the reasons we've talked about, why any country should back their currency by gold.
[02:04:25.441 --> 02:04:26.963]  Here, he was actually doing it.
[02:04:27.323 --> 02:04:40.036]  And he brought in consultants, including the likes of Tony Blair from former Prime Minister of Britain, who after within six months of being, leaving Downing Street and being a consultant for J.P.
[02:04:40.076 --> 02:04:40.417]  Morgan,
[02:04:40.757 --> 02:04:49.365]  Getting his three million dollars a year as a consultant for JP Morgan, Gaddafi, you know, found himself at the end of a, you know, a pipe dead.
[02:04:50.085 --> 02:04:59.874]  So, to give you an idea of who the bigger threat is in the world today, Muammar Gaddafi or Tony Blair, I would posit that Tony Blair is the greater evil in that equation.
[02:05:00.379 --> 02:05:12.141]  Sure, it comes down to just absolute criminal despotism, and Libya invested its money with the globalists, they just killed Gaddafi, took the money, put Al-Qaeda in, and now they said they've got to invade Libya because Al-Qaeda's there.
[02:05:12.521 --> 02:05:18.842]  Hillary today was in the news, I have the article here on the stack, saying we've got to invade Syria because they're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:05:19.422 --> 02:05:23.463]  Doesn't matter if the West publicly put Al-Qaeda in, it is unbelievable.
[02:05:23.523 --> 02:05:26.384]  Kalen in North Carolina, you're on the air with Max Keiser, go ahead.
[02:05:27.464 --> 02:05:28.724]  Hi, Jim House.
[02:05:29.648 --> 02:05:32.569]  I just have one, I have really two questions.
[02:05:33.349 --> 02:05:39.490]  One, I'm looking at this website that's showing the presidential write-in rules.
[02:05:40.150 --> 02:05:56.694]  It's from 2008, but I'm looking at some of these rules and it's kind of scary because the way they've got them written it seems, because you know with Ron Paul not getting the Republican nominee after the RNC screwed him over, it seems that the way these rules are written it seems that they're not even
[02:05:57.463 --> 02:06:00.045]  Allowing write-ins to even count at all.
[02:06:01.125 --> 02:06:01.946]  Yeah, no, they don't.
[02:06:01.966 --> 02:06:03.827]  If it's not on the ballot, it's not on the ballot.
[02:06:04.047 --> 02:06:08.530]  And everything they're doing is to keep third parties or any other voice out of things.
[02:06:08.930 --> 02:06:10.351]  Any comments on that, Max Keiser?
[02:06:11.449 --> 02:06:12.590]  I didn't vote this year.
[02:06:13.911 --> 02:06:17.375]  I'm not going to be suckered into taking this thing seriously.
[02:06:18.275 --> 02:06:18.876]  Don't vote.
[02:06:18.936 --> 02:06:19.677]  Don't vote at all.
[02:06:19.717 --> 02:06:21.518]  It's a joke.
[02:06:21.779 --> 02:06:27.183]  America has been euthanized by big money, big banks.
[02:06:29.366 --> 02:06:39.020]  You know, I don't want to mention the name of the poor woman, but there was a case in America a few years ago where this poor woman was in a vegetable state for years and it became a huge story.
[02:06:39.441 --> 02:06:40.342]  But this is America.
[02:06:40.382 --> 02:06:41.444]  America is a vegetable.
[02:06:42.004 --> 02:06:44.188]  They're keeping it alive with artificial money printing.
[02:06:44.508 --> 02:06:48.090]  But by every medical definition, it's dead.
[02:06:48.491 --> 02:06:51.132]  So why am I going to waste time voting for a dead duck?
[02:06:51.613 --> 02:06:52.693]  It's a complete waste.
[02:06:53.234 --> 02:06:53.794]  It's gone.
[02:06:54.194 --> 02:07:03.960]  So just let the rest of these other banks collapse and let's see what we have on the other end of this collapse and what we can salvage at the other end of this global collapse.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:04.721]  But there's nothing.
[02:07:04.941 --> 02:07:05.582]  Absolutely not.
[02:07:05.602 --> 02:07:07.063]  Well, that's what Ron Paul says.
[02:07:07.083 --> 02:07:08.745]  You know, things are going to collapse.
[02:07:08.865 --> 02:07:15.271]  We need to be pointing out who did it so the people that did it can't pose as saviors once everything collapses.
[02:07:16.325 --> 02:07:28.636]  Well, you know, Ron Paul, as we've said many times, he is a student of all of this, historically speaking, and the banks and the central banks, and he speaks wise words, you know, but of course they wouldn't let him debate, would they?
[02:07:28.676 --> 02:07:30.357]  They wouldn't let him get on the ballot, would they?
[02:07:30.457 --> 02:07:33.880]  Because, my God, what if Ron Paul was actually President of the United States?
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:35.702]  You'd have, like, a sound dollar!
[02:07:35.962 --> 02:07:37.163]  You'd have competitiveness!
[02:07:37.423 --> 02:07:37.924]  You'd have...
[02:07:38.504 --> 02:07:39.285]  Common sense!
[02:07:39.545 --> 02:07:41.688]  But all of that is not profitable.
[02:07:42.449 --> 02:07:50.260]  If you're a bankster, you don't want any of that, because you want to be able to continue to roll over bad debts, collect fees, and start wars.
[02:07:52.375 --> 02:07:55.437]  Max Keiser, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:07:55.577 --> 02:07:59.399]  Obviously, we'll get updates from you very soon as all of this unfolds.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:15.469]  We'll continue with calls from Jessica, Tommy, Sean, Mike, and many others that are patiently holding after we get an update on the latest numbers in the puppet selection from our own David Knight and coming up, Jakari Jackson.
[02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:18.411]  We're also going to be talking to Wayne Madsen and continuing with your calls.
[02:08:18.751 --> 02:08:21.073]  Max Keiser, as always, thank you for spending time with us.
[02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:22.734]  When are you coming on my show?
[02:08:23.614 --> 02:08:24.955]  Anytime you want, buddy.
[02:08:25.756 --> 02:08:27.236]  Alright, I'll hold you to that.
[02:08:27.437 --> 02:08:27.757]  See ya!
[02:08:28.137 --> 02:08:29.318]  There goes Max Keiser.
[02:08:29.338 --> 02:08:31.339]  Hey, really good Skype audio today.
[02:08:31.539 --> 02:08:32.059]  Or tonight.
[02:08:32.079 --> 02:08:34.421]  I guess it's 2 in the morning over there in England time.
[02:08:35.001 --> 02:08:36.122]  Or 1.30 in the morning, I don't know.
[02:08:36.742 --> 02:08:37.843]  Uh, look, um...
[02:08:39.738 --> 02:08:45.441]  We got a lot more coming up here, and things will get clearer and clearer throughout the night, what's going on, what the Globalists are going to do.
[02:08:46.162 --> 02:08:48.263]  It looks like this might drag on into tomorrow.
[02:08:48.503 --> 02:08:49.684]  That's contention.
[02:08:51.105 --> 02:08:54.627]  And the longer things go, the more chances you've got for civil unrest.
[02:08:54.687 --> 02:08:59.270]  Because people riot over their stupid football or baseball or basketball teams winning or losing.
[02:08:59.970 --> 02:09:04.693]  And this has all become very Coke, Pepsi, Ford, Chevy, rah, rah, Romney, Obama.
[02:09:05.689 --> 02:09:22.802]  And you've had, as I've pointed out, this is really the big issue, you've had globalist operatives like Michael Moore and Bill Maher, you know, calling for violence, calling for racial attacks of white guys trying to incite people into this part of their divide and conquer program.
[02:09:22.822 --> 02:09:29.207]  Because if we ever lived together in peace and had freedom, well, they'd be out of a job posing as, you know, the guys protecting us all from racism.
[02:09:30.428 --> 02:09:32.210]  And so they're really pushing for that.
[02:09:32.991 --> 02:09:34.953]  If Obama gets back in, look out.
[02:09:35.113 --> 02:09:36.735]  If Romney gets in, look out.
[02:09:38.056 --> 02:09:43.022]  I personally really don't like Eric Holder and the Justice Department and the Fast and Furious and things they've done.
[02:09:43.042 --> 02:09:46.466]  And I don't like a president not facing re-election.
[02:09:47.763 --> 02:09:49.964]  But now the polls are closed across much of the country.
[02:09:49.984 --> 02:09:51.484]  They're not closed out in California yet.
[02:09:53.025 --> 02:09:56.826]  And again, it doesn't matter who we communicate with, who we talk to.
[02:09:57.246 --> 02:09:59.587]  The final equation, the globalists will make that decision.
[02:10:00.447 --> 02:10:03.568]  We're going to go to a break here, correct?
[02:10:05.031 --> 02:10:08.452]  And then we're going to come back in about two minutes, three minutes with David Knight.
[02:10:09.532 --> 02:10:14.013]  And then he's going to be throwing it to some of the reporters out there on the ground as well in Austin, Texas.
[02:10:14.533 --> 02:10:18.553]  And then we will tee up for the live transmission, Wayne Madsen.
[02:10:19.614 --> 02:10:22.254]  And then as I said, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:10:22.274 --> 02:10:26.195]  We're going to have Lou Rockwell, Nomi Prins, and so many others.
[02:10:27.115 --> 02:10:27.875]  Webster Tarpley.
[02:10:27.915 --> 02:10:29.115]  We end with Webster Tarpley.
[02:10:30.296 --> 02:10:31.656]  And then, you know, as I said,
[02:10:33.036 --> 02:10:35.518]  I have been on the air, I don't know, like five, six hours today.
[02:10:35.538 --> 02:10:37.860]  And I'll be honest with you, it is exhausting.
[02:10:38.601 --> 02:10:40.943]  But it's also exhilarating to be alive and focused.
[02:10:41.723 --> 02:10:44.585]  So I will continue as long as I can.
[02:10:44.605 --> 02:10:48.749]  I don't know, I've got to be here for Tarpley because we're going to hear all about the Mormon Mafia.
[02:10:50.070 --> 02:10:52.632]  And so I look forward to that being sarcastic.
[02:10:54.270 --> 02:10:55.090]  Yeah, yes.
[02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:56.751]  Lep in the Hood, up to no good.
[02:10:56.771 --> 02:10:58.912]  In fact, we should go to YouTube.
[02:10:58.952 --> 02:11:01.693]  We should come in with that, with him doing the Lep in the Hood.
[02:11:01.733 --> 02:11:02.294]  It's up to no good.
[02:11:02.314 --> 02:11:07.556]  If you don't know what I'm talking about, you will see it if the Skeleton Crew is able to get that done.
[02:11:08.076 --> 02:11:11.278]  You know, I planned some of this, and I was like, let's do some live feeds on the streets.
[02:11:11.298 --> 02:11:19.361]  So they sent like half the reporters out to do live feeds, which we're not even really going to, but those are being archived as well at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:19.401 --> 02:11:20.442]  We'll continue with these guests.
[02:11:20.922 --> 02:11:23.183]  It's important for all of you out there to continue
[02:11:23.903 --> 02:11:25.665]  Spread the word about the free audio and video feeds.
[02:11:25.685 --> 02:11:29.228]  There is a giant audience for not being on broadcast radio right now.
[02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:35.053]  That is, tune into those video and audio feeds right now at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:11:35.594 --> 02:11:38.136]  Okay, the tireder I get, the more I run on.
[02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:45.422]  We're gonna go to break and come back with David Knight in the TV studio, giving us some of the latest numbers and more right here.
[02:11:45.763 --> 02:11:46.563]  It's InfoWars
[02:11:47.644 --> 02:11:51.465]  .com coverage, true grassroots, real analysis.
[02:11:52.045 --> 02:11:53.786]  Somebody had to do it, and you know what?
[02:11:53.806 --> 02:11:54.966]  We're trying our best.
[02:11:55.066 --> 02:11:55.526]  Stay with us.
[02:11:56.947 --> 02:12:04.629]  I'm President Barack Barry Obama, and you're watching continual coverage of the 2012 presidential election, here on InfoWars.com.
[02:12:27.765 --> 02:12:28.706]  We have been robbed.
[02:12:28.806 --> 02:12:31.649]  Globalism has been a curse to this country.
[02:12:32.249 --> 02:12:35.833]  Everything the globalists are doing worldwide is about making you dependent.
[02:12:36.393 --> 02:12:41.418]  I'm getting storable food, you need it, because it's the only insurance that you can 100% use.
[02:12:41.438 --> 02:12:51.248]  I have, you know, family that are veterans and people like that, who can't live off their social security, who are disabled and things, and that's why I've bought so much food.
[02:12:51.488 --> 02:12:52.789]  Charity starts at home.
[02:12:53.550 --> 02:12:55.031]  I promote what I believe in 100%.
[02:12:55.071 --> 02:12:57.773]  And I believe in what they're doing 100%.
[02:12:58.113 --> 02:13:01.036]  And the globalists do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[02:13:01.296 --> 02:13:03.137]  I hope you will take action.
[02:13:03.558 --> 02:13:05.599]  Get the six free meals when you pay for the shipping.

[02:13:09.582 --> 02:13:10.963]  That's why I chose eFoods.
[02:13:10.983 --> 02:13:11.784]  I did my research.
[02:13:11.824 --> 02:13:12.665]  I tested a bunch.
[02:13:12.725 --> 02:13:13.265]  Bought a bunch.
[02:13:13.606 --> 02:13:17.489]  The other stuff was like cardboard or filled with MSG or made in China.
[02:13:18.269 --> 02:13:28.853]  So, bottom line folks, efoods.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.

[02:15:00.538 --> 02:15:00.878]  We're good to go.
[02:15:25.191 --> 02:15:25.692]  Welcome back.
[02:15:25.992 --> 02:15:27.454]  We're here with some live election news.
[02:15:27.514 --> 02:15:33.582]  Now Alex is covering the real story and what's really happening in the world with his guests like Max Keiser, Gerald Slinti.
[02:15:33.602 --> 02:15:35.605]  He's got several more guests lined up.
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:40.604]  But we're here to tell you what's going on in the beauty contest of this puppet election.
[02:15:41.184 --> 02:15:45.888]  And we've got some interesting news, something that's a little bit different that has been reported so far.
[02:15:46.489 --> 02:15:54.676]  In New Jersey, they haven't called it for Romney yet, but right now he's leading Obama 54 to 43 percent.
[02:15:54.756 --> 02:15:55.796]  That's a bit of a surprise.
[02:15:55.837 --> 02:15:59.800]  The rest of the map is not really very much of a surprise, because what you're seeing on the rest of the map
[02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:06.693]  Is Illinois and the other northeastern states going for Obama as expected?
[02:16:07.694 --> 02:16:14.058]  The southern states have reported and throughout the, starting to go over towards the Midwest, they're starting to close polls over there.
[02:16:14.478 --> 02:16:23.924]  So far the states that have been called are kind of what people expected, so no surprises there, except for possibly New Jersey, but of course they haven't called that yet.
[02:16:25.996 --> 02:16:36.899]  Now, when Alex was on, he had a caller who called him from Tampa, complaining about some irregularities at the polling place, saying that they had Obama paraphernalia inside the polling place.
[02:16:36.959 --> 02:16:46.861]  And it's pretty standard throughout the country, certainly in Florida, it's a law that you don't have any campaign literature for either party within 100 feet of the polling place.
[02:16:46.901 --> 02:16:52.542]  But inside the polling place, he reported seeing Obama literature and things like that.
[02:16:52.582 --> 02:16:55.383]  But that's something that actually Drudge has reported on that.
[02:16:56.063 --> 02:17:06.129]  And both, again, in Tampa, I don't know if it's the same precinct that this fellow was calling from, but there's actually a large Obama poster in the precinct in Tampa.
[02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:13.854]  And then also in Philadelphia, they had a very large Obama poster that they partially covered.
[02:17:14.654 --> 02:17:15.935]  We got a picture of that coming up.
[02:17:16.255 --> 02:17:17.076]  There it is right there.
[02:17:17.696 --> 02:17:19.897]  It partially covered that poster of Obama.
[02:17:21.832 --> 02:17:31.558]  The other thing that was interesting is an article that Drudge had was, you and observers are amazed that we don't require ID at polling places.
[02:17:31.658 --> 02:17:32.258]  Well, guess what?
[02:17:32.458 --> 02:17:36.941]  Most of us Americans are also equally amazed that there is no identification process.
[02:17:37.641 --> 02:17:38.582]  No, we're good.
[02:17:53.078 --> 02:18:01.001]  Dead mother had just immediately preceded him in voting, according to the Board of Elections, and they were able to pull that ballot out.
[02:18:01.081 --> 02:18:04.663]  But we're seeing that happen quite a lot, especially in North Carolina.
[02:18:04.683 --> 02:18:08.625]  They're notorious for the 112-year-old voters who are voting.
[02:18:08.665 --> 02:18:11.046]  There's been 3,000 or 4,000 of those that have voted.
[02:18:15.329 --> 02:18:20.054]  90% of those are within just four of the 100 counties in North Carolina.
[02:18:20.094 --> 02:18:22.137]  We're seeing that kind of corruption.
[02:18:22.177 --> 02:18:31.609]  But there's all kinds of retail corruption in terms of invalid voters not being purged from the rolls, people being allowed to vote without any identification.
[02:18:32.493 --> 02:18:38.719]  Um, we also have some interesting, uh, like I said, we had some glitches, uh, some other people possibly having glitches.
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:48.228]  At KPHO, uh, they put up a graphic that showed Obama with 43% of the vote and Romney with 40% of the vote with 99 precincts reporting.
[02:18:48.348 --> 02:18:49.950]  Left that up for about 17 seconds.
[02:18:50.490 --> 02:18:55.055]  Again, that could be a glitch, uh, just testing out a screen or something, um, live feeds like that.
[02:18:55.115 --> 02:18:56.296]  But more interesting, uh,
[02:18:56.896 --> 02:19:09.741]  Possibly, is something Aaron Dykes reported on, on InfoWars, and that is that earlier in the night, Fox put up a graphic showing Obama quite ahead in the voting.
[02:19:09.781 --> 02:19:26.068]  They had him, actually at that time it was 6.20pm central, they posted a graphic that showed 42 million votes for Obama, 32 million for Romney, under the title, it's a wrap, campaigning is done, Romney-Obama await the verdict.
[02:19:27.507 --> 02:19:35.090]  Interesting, because Fox News, unlike most of the other news outlets, seem to be, it's a close election.
[02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:48.014]  CNN, MSNBC are calling it for Obama, whereas Fox is adamantly asserting that Romney is going to win according to their polls and their analysts and that sort of thing.
[02:19:48.034 --> 02:19:51.615]  So it's kind of interesting that they would put up a graphic showing Obama winning.
[02:19:53.848 --> 02:19:57.271]  And then of course, Chris Matthews had a rant.
[02:19:59.293 --> 02:20:04.858]  Title was, Chris Matthews Goes Unobnoxious Rant Against Idiots Who Vote for Third Party or Stay Home.
[02:20:04.898 --> 02:20:06.039]  That was on MediaTite.
[02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:10.584]  And he said, basically, if you vote for one of these numbskulls,
[02:20:11.984 --> 02:20:19.328]  And a third or fourth party candidate, like the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, or Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and say, I was surprised at what happened.
[02:20:19.568 --> 02:20:25.971]  No, you shouldn't be, because idiots like you voted for third or fourth party candidates, and they don't know how the system works.
[02:20:27.312 --> 02:20:37.337]  He said, I'm really bothered, he continued on, he said, I'm really bothered by people who thought, oh, I thought I would vote for John Anderson, or I really like Ralph Nader and what he stands for.
[02:20:37.357 --> 02:20:40.318]  That has nothing to do with the presidency, he says, nothing to do with it.
[02:20:41.115 --> 02:20:42.737]  Well, I don't think so.
[02:20:43.678 --> 02:20:49.304]  And I think a lot of our viewers on InfoWars don't think so either.
[02:20:49.324 --> 02:20:50.686]  We've got some polls that we've put up.
[02:20:50.726 --> 02:20:56.672]  There's a page that we've set up on InfoWars.com where we ask viewers a few questions.
[02:20:57.293 --> 02:20:59.635]  And one of those questions we asked was,
[02:21:00.802 --> 02:21:03.103]  You know, who you voted for, for President, or did you vote?
[02:21:03.603 --> 02:21:07.984]  Interestingly enough, Johnson got 38% of the people who voted in it.
[02:21:08.004 --> 02:21:15.547]  It's not scientific, it's just something that people volunteer to do on our site, so it's kind of reflective maybe of our audience.
[02:21:16.067 --> 02:21:17.068]  Johnson got 38%, Romney 26%, Ron Paul 15%.
[02:21:17.108 --> 02:21:19.088]  That's 15% of the people who wrote him in.
[02:21:24.935 --> 02:21:28.298]  About the same number of people that didn't vote, which is 15%.
[02:21:28.578 --> 02:21:30.460]  And Obama only got 3%.
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:38.546]  Now, actually there's some other interesting questions on that poll, on some of those polls.
[02:21:38.627 --> 02:21:47.834]  Some of them, there was one question we asked that, if you voted in the presidential race, did you vote enthusiastically for someone, or vote reluctantly for the lesser of two evils?
[02:21:48.375 --> 02:21:52.118]  Interestingly enough, about 60% of people said they voted
[02:21:52.791 --> 02:21:56.332]  For someone, as opposed to just voting for the lesser of two evils.
[02:21:58.053 --> 02:22:08.036]  Also, I think, interesting in a poll is the fact that we asked, is there something other than president that you thought was important as a reason to vote?
[02:22:08.696 --> 02:22:12.038]  And ballot initiative was on there for 34% of the people.
[02:22:12.058 --> 02:22:22.021]  And we know that there's a very important ballot initiative in California that's on the ballot there about GMO labeling and requiring truth in labeling on food.
[02:22:23.321 --> 02:22:49.766]  We have extensive labeling for everything that we eat except for genetically modified organisms or things that are added to the food and we would just like to have honest food but evidently agribusiness doesn't want to see that happening and it's interesting earlier in the broadcast we had some graphics from that we created off the raw data from OpenSecrets.org that showed how different segments of
[02:22:50.316 --> 02:22:52.157]  We're contributing to the political candidates.
[02:22:52.697 --> 02:22:58.038]  And agribusiness really, although they gave most of their money to Romney, they really didn't contribute that much.
[02:22:59.379 --> 02:23:15.004]  But if you look at what they were giving, it really put this contribution to the ballot initiative in California about GMO, that really put that in perspective because that's huge compared to what they actually spent on the presidential election.
[02:23:15.024 --> 02:23:19.245]  They're spending way more on that Prop 37 than they did to influence the presidency.
[02:23:19.805 --> 02:23:22.168]  We've got a live report now coming up from David Ortiz.
[02:23:22.228 --> 02:23:26.374]  He's out in the street here in Austin talking to people about the election.
[02:23:26.454 --> 02:23:27.435]  David, can you hear me?
[02:23:28.236 --> 02:23:29.538]  Hey David, how are you?
[02:23:29.818 --> 02:23:30.259]  Doing great.
[02:23:31.801 --> 02:23:32.341]  How's everything?
[02:23:32.742 --> 02:23:37.448]  What are the people telling you out there about how they're voting?
[02:23:38.797 --> 02:23:44.180]  Well, David, I mean, Austin, full disclosure, Austin is a democratic city from what I'm told.
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:50.763]  But believe it or not, given that reality, it seems that Mitt Romney seems to be doing well here.
[02:23:50.823 --> 02:24:03.510]  I'm here at Austin City Hall in downtown Austin, the heart of the city, and so far I have nine people voting for Obama, seven people voting for Mitt Romney, and one for Gary Johnson.
[02:24:05.511 --> 02:24:05.952]  Was that you?
[02:24:10.677 --> 02:24:12.798]  There you go.
[02:24:13.138 --> 02:24:16.660]  We've also got some ballot initiatives here in Austin, right?
[02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:18.061]  That you have there.
[02:24:18.521 --> 02:24:20.002]  Did you get any information about that?
[02:24:20.582 --> 02:24:21.442]  Any polls from people?
[02:24:21.462 --> 02:24:22.883]  What they think about the ballot initiatives?
[02:24:24.753 --> 02:24:24.953]  Yes.
[02:24:43.927 --> 02:24:50.353]  Over the course of the next year to help loan the University of Texas money to build a medical school.
[02:24:50.993 --> 02:24:56.318]  Now the University of Texas is one of the wealthiest schools, one of the wealthiest universities in the United States.
[02:24:56.638 --> 02:24:59.240]  It has about 20 billion dollars in assets.
[02:24:59.561 --> 02:25:06.126]  That's with a B. Yet they're still asking the taxpayers here for money to help them build a medical school.
[02:25:06.387 --> 02:25:07.868]  And I did speak to someone earlier
[02:25:08.368 --> 02:25:18.373]  Who said she voted for Obama, that she did support that initiative, that proposition, because she thinks we need the jobs, we need more physicians here in Austin.
[02:25:18.794 --> 02:25:22.475]  So yeah, it's called Prop 1.
[02:25:22.716 --> 02:25:24.977]  And there's also another proposition as well.
[02:25:25.957 --> 02:25:27.138]  What's that other proposition?
[02:25:27.912 --> 02:25:39.353]  That other proposition is Prop 3, and actually I've been hearing from the Libertarian headquarters that it has a lot of tri-partisan, if that's even how you say it, support among Libertarians, Republicans, and Democrats.
[02:25:39.373 --> 02:25:40.636]  They think it's going to pass tonight.
[02:25:41.044 --> 02:25:50.131]  And it's basically a proposition that says they want local residents to redistrict the district.
[02:25:50.411 --> 02:25:57.657]  They don't want congressional officials deciding what a congressional representative represents.
[02:25:57.997 --> 02:26:05.963]  They want to have a committee, a non-partisan committee, that decides how this town, how this city should be redistricted.
[02:26:06.484 --> 02:26:08.165]  And they say that's very important.
[02:26:08.923 --> 02:26:16.373]  Also, as part of that proposition, they want to have 10 council representatives as opposed to 7.
[02:26:17.294 --> 02:26:22.401]  And they want to make sure that each one of those council representatives represents no more than 10%.
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:23.960]  I don't
[02:26:46.738 --> 02:26:47.879]  Well, that's an interesting idea.
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:52.463]  You know, it's one of the things I think that's happened to get Congress out of control.
[02:26:52.523 --> 02:26:56.507]  It used to be, it was intended as a House of Representatives, to represent the people.
[02:26:56.967 --> 02:27:04.774]  And if you look at the number of people that are represented by each congressman, it's up to nearly 600,000 people now.
[02:27:05.615 --> 02:27:12.962]  You know, originally they were looking at capping it at about 50,000, you know, when they were talking about in the early draft of the Constitution.
[02:27:13.822 --> 02:27:27.725]  It's something that people have suggested as a possible reform for the federal level, and that would be to, there's nothing magic about 435 representatives, but it got capped at that number early in the 20th century.
[02:27:28.265 --> 02:27:39.047]  So I think it'd be a great thing to see, you know, once you have more representatives, once you've got more councilmen, for example, in Austin, then power is distributed among more people.
[02:27:39.107 --> 02:27:43.088]  You don't have that much opportunity for concentration of power and corruption, that sort of thing.
[02:27:44.016 --> 02:27:45.377]  Well, that's interesting.
[02:27:45.577 --> 02:27:49.598]  Absolutely, and a lot of these congressional representatives are very slick.
[02:27:49.858 --> 02:27:55.140]  When they redraw their district, they make sure that their party wins.
[02:27:55.561 --> 02:27:59.802]  That they redraw a district that's favorable to their party.
[02:28:00.142 --> 02:28:08.746]  So with this proposition, they're going to make sure that the people, if it has to be redistricted, they're going to make sure that a non-partisan committee does that.
[02:28:09.246 --> 02:28:11.227]  Well, that's interesting because I know in North Carolina,
[02:28:12.223 --> 02:28:15.065]  North Carolina has been predominantly Democrat for a long time.
[02:28:15.465 --> 02:28:26.650]  We've had some Republican governors and some Republican senators, but pretty much the rest of the congressional delegation, as well as all the state representatives and senators, were always Democrat.
[02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:37.856]  In this last election, at 2010, they had a Republican swing, and so that was the big plum that they were going to be able to redistrict everything to help themselves in congressional races to get that.
[02:28:39.168 --> 02:28:39.668]  Interesting.
[02:28:40.769 --> 02:28:49.735]  And also, David, just as far as the environment here is concerned, there was literally about a thousand people waiting online for about an hour and a half.
[02:28:50.276 --> 02:29:01.563]  So despite the fact that the two-party system is obviously, in my estimation, a fraud, I speak for myself, it is nice to see that Americans still on some level do care.
[02:29:01.863 --> 02:29:07.007]  They're waiting for about an hour and a half, and the feel here is that they're excited.
[02:29:07.147 --> 02:29:07.767]  They're excited.
[02:29:07.787 --> 02:29:08.828]  Oh, that's great.
[02:29:09.935 --> 02:29:10.955]  Well, thank you very much, David.
[02:29:11.256 --> 02:29:18.478]  It's a great report, and people do want to have some say in their government, and we want people to understand how that can happen.
[02:29:18.518 --> 02:29:26.741]  And one of the ways that has to happen is for us to get rid of the massive fraud that is being perpetuated as part of the vote-taking and vote registration, that sort of thing.
[02:29:26.821 --> 02:29:27.922]  One more quick look at the map.
[02:29:28.382 --> 02:29:34.464]  Right now they're giving 78 votes to Obama and 88 to Romney in terms of electoral votes.
[02:29:35.231 --> 02:29:44.653]  And again, the map is filling in with the central and southern part turning all red for Romney and the northeast with the exception of New Jersey.
[02:29:44.673 --> 02:29:47.174]  Well, they've now called New Jersey for Obama, I see.
[02:29:49.975 --> 02:29:50.755]  They've switched that.
[02:29:50.915 --> 02:29:55.316]  That was almost exactly the opposite of what it was a little while ago.
[02:29:55.336 --> 02:29:56.396]  So maybe it was a typo.
[02:29:56.416 --> 02:29:56.816]  Who knows?
[02:29:56.916 --> 02:29:59.277]  Or maybe they just changed the machines.
[02:30:01.034 --> 02:30:04.177]  Um, well we've got, uh, do we have Alex ready to go?
[02:30:04.197 --> 02:30:04.457]  Yeah.
[02:30:04.497 --> 02:30:05.198]  Yes, David.
[02:30:05.318 --> 02:30:07.740]  Amazing, amazing hearing you break all that down.
[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:08.821]  Great job.
[02:30:08.841 --> 02:30:10.202]  We'll have more calls coming up.
[02:30:10.222 --> 02:30:13.465]  We're gonna get a quick update from Aaron Dykes and then we're gonna have Wayne Madsen on.
[02:30:13.485 --> 02:30:20.451]  Then we'll continue with phone calls and back to you one more time before Jakari Jackson gets in there and starts reporting on the latest numbers.
[02:30:20.811 --> 02:30:21.572]  Thank you very much, David.
[02:30:24.272 --> 02:30:26.575]  All right, Aaron Dykes in here.
[02:30:26.735 --> 02:30:29.698]  You've been going over the news intensely the last few hours.
[02:30:30.139 --> 02:30:41.953]  What are you noticing, DevelopedInfoWars.com reporter Aaron Dykes, in here on the selection of the new Supreme Puppet so we can feel like they're actually running things instead of foreign banks that have occupied and taken this country over?
[02:30:42.313 --> 02:30:52.816]  Well, it is a farce, of course, Alex, and we know it's going to be business as usual, regardless of which president gets into office or remains in office, because war with Iran remains very possible.
[02:30:52.836 --> 02:30:56.697]  We know that GMO-friendly administrations will continue.
[02:30:56.797 --> 02:30:59.838]  We know that Wall Street-friendly administrations will continue.
[02:30:59.898 --> 02:31:05.340]  If Bernanke isn't retained, it'll be someone just like him continuing QE infinity.
[02:31:06.081 --> 02:31:11.407]  And so we've really got the same system already locked in by selection process.
[02:31:11.427 --> 02:31:20.277]  But in terms of the election itself, we started covering this yesterday, how key Ohio will be to the final election results.
[02:31:20.297 --> 02:31:22.320]  There have already been lawsuits filed.
[02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:25.262]  And I really don't see Ohio being settled.
[02:31:25.442 --> 02:31:29.986]  As of yesterday, the polls were completely dead even.
[02:31:30.006 --> 02:31:31.547]  49-49 for either candidate.
[02:31:31.848 --> 02:31:38.593]  And you've got the Secretary of State there who has put in, quote, experimental patches into the electronic voting machine.
[02:31:38.613 --> 02:31:39.093]  Well, that's good.
[02:31:39.114 --> 02:31:39.694]  They're helping.
[02:31:40.114 --> 02:31:44.558]  And people in New Jersey can mail in their ballots or do them by email.
[02:31:44.618 --> 02:31:45.459]  I think that's good.
[02:31:45.979 --> 02:31:55.108]  Yeah, and on the New Jersey and New York front, they've ordered more evacuations over the northeastern storm that's coming in overnight into tomorrow.
[02:31:55.148 --> 02:31:57.610]  So there's a lot of voters who've been ordered to evacuate.
[02:31:57.991 --> 02:32:02.475]  Now, while neither New Jersey or New York are swing states, it may prove important.
[02:32:02.515 --> 02:32:05.178]  And why are they being ordered to evacuate from a winter storm?
[02:32:05.198 --> 02:32:07.360]  I mean, folks up there don't want to deal with the winter.
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:08.221]  I guess they don't have power.
[02:32:08.681 --> 02:32:26.305]  I mean, it may cause more flooding, but I think a lot of it's just kind of alarmism, but there's a lot of potential for chaos, and you've got these headlines here from NBC, other major news sources, that the voting system is suffering major glitches, the deadline's been extended to Friday, and yeah, like you said, people are mailing in ballots, they're faxing them in.
[02:32:26.725 --> 02:32:32.167]  That's gonna be real strange stuff, and whether or not that affects something important local to those states, I guess we'll find out.
[02:32:33.427 --> 02:32:33.927]  Fraud?
[02:32:34.107 --> 02:32:39.229]  Oh no, it's just that whole case of both sides are obviously cheating and we'll find out who cheats more.
[02:32:41.450 --> 02:32:48.132]  But I mean, literally, it's like, are you going to be shot in the head with a shotgun or a high-powered rifle?
[02:32:48.233 --> 02:32:53.915]  It's like, it doesn't matter who gets elected, you're just wanting to know which new puppet president's going to be in there.
[02:32:54.275 --> 02:33:02.698]  But again, this whole pageant about the president is about making us think they actually run something, when the foreign banks can't control themselves bragging that they've conquered us.
[02:33:03.118 --> 02:33:06.564]  I think the gravity of the two-party system remains very interesting.
[02:33:06.584 --> 02:33:08.286]  I mean, we covered this in Obama Deception.
[02:33:08.326 --> 02:33:13.414]  We had the little extra where the two pillars, Republican and Democrat, come together to form that pyramid.
[02:33:13.775 --> 02:33:16.539]  They're opposing forces, but they prop each other up.
[02:33:16.559 --> 02:33:17.460]  Do we have Wayne Madsen?
[02:33:19.292 --> 02:33:20.353]  We're going to go to Wayne just in a moment.
[02:33:20.373 --> 02:33:23.055]  We've gotten a little bit behind tonight, obviously about 15 minutes behind.
[02:33:23.095 --> 02:33:27.277]  I apologize to our guests, but we're going to get to Wayne Madsen, formerly the National Security Agency.
[02:33:27.297 --> 02:33:28.658]  Great investigative journalist at the moment.
[02:33:28.999 --> 02:33:29.999]  Aaron, hit your other points.
[02:33:30.019 --> 02:33:34.562]  We're going to have you back in soon, too, after the next visit with David Knight to give us more breaking news.
[02:33:34.582 --> 02:33:35.403]  But what else you got there?
[02:33:35.643 --> 02:33:42.185]  Well, it's just interesting how little people approved of Romney in the primary process, but now they've gotten behind him because of fear of Obama.
[02:33:42.525 --> 02:33:49.426]  And on the other side, so many people disenfranchised with Obama because of his lies and broken promises, but because they don't want to see Romney.
[02:33:49.466 --> 02:33:50.747]  Well, it's basic psychology.
[02:33:50.787 --> 02:34:00.189]  It's like the bankers would fund the Soviets and the U.S., but then get both countries to go into tyranny in the name of fighting the other when they were being handled and run by the same people.
[02:34:00.885 --> 02:34:02.246]  Yeah, and it's crazy.
[02:34:02.286 --> 02:34:05.309]  I mean, this election has a lot of different rules with provisional ballots.
[02:34:05.629 --> 02:34:07.731]  You can vote at all these different locations.
[02:34:07.751 --> 02:34:12.636]  They've got a lot of chaos at these polls, you know, farce as it is, but we'll see what happens.
[02:34:13.557 --> 02:34:19.942]  Well, you know, the one message I want to get out there tonight that I haven't really talked enough about, because thinking about this election, I thought we're going to do live coverage.
[02:34:19.962 --> 02:34:21.003]  I'm going to cover it on the radio.
[02:34:21.724 --> 02:34:28.411]  I kind of get greedy and book so many guests, I never get to all my points, but you vote with your dollars when you buy organic food.
[02:34:28.751 --> 02:34:30.773]  You vote with your dollars when you buy firearms.
[02:34:31.133 --> 02:34:34.937]  You vote with your dollars when you shop local and buy local.
[02:34:35.257 --> 02:34:42.624]  And none of us are perfect, but there's still the jury, there's jury nullification, there's the grand jury, there's still your free speech.
[02:34:43.345 --> 02:34:46.407]  We've got to discredit this system because it is predatory and out of control.
[02:34:46.927 --> 02:34:50.009]  And we've got to realize there's more ways to vote than just every four years.
[02:34:50.749 --> 02:34:51.049]  I agree.
[02:34:51.109 --> 02:34:55.832]  I mean, the GMO issue in California, Prop 37, has been a huge spending measure.
[02:34:55.852 --> 02:35:04.716]  There's been a lot of focus on it because everyone realizes it could tip into the whole country, could lead to real federal... And again, you had two to one, you know, four labeling a month ago.
[02:35:04.736 --> 02:35:07.798]  When they say, oh, suddenly it's flipped the other way, they're just getting folks ready for fraud.
[02:35:07.878 --> 02:35:08.558]  I agree.
[02:35:08.778 --> 02:35:13.619]  It's like 90% of Californians vote to kill themselves.
[02:35:14.039 --> 02:35:14.840]  Yes, it's true.
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:16.100]  You voted to die.
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:19.501]  Why not have 100% announce that we all want to slit our throats?
[02:35:19.761 --> 02:35:21.641]  It's all horse crap.
[02:35:21.961 --> 02:35:33.404]  And you've seen all kinds of major papers throughout California nationally lying through their teeth saying the stuff has been tested and approved and that people are okay with GMOs and that nobody's that concerned and that it's gonna
[02:35:33.764 --> 02:35:36.466]  Everybody loves it and everybody loves vaccines, Aaron.
[02:35:36.506 --> 02:35:36.886]  How about zero?
[02:35:36.906 --> 02:35:38.407]  Everyone loves Big Brother and Oceania.
[02:35:56.462 --> 02:35:58.483]  Are you concerned about the Iran war games, Alex?
[02:35:58.843 --> 02:36:06.846]  The idea that whatever president's elected, they may stage something in the immediate aftermath and make either candidate go with this wider war?
[02:36:08.267 --> 02:36:11.408]  But it's not war, because Obama has a peace promise.
[02:36:12.308 --> 02:36:16.250]  When they dropped bombs over Libya for six months, that was peaceful.
[02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:20.291]  And Hillary said today, we've got to go into Syria, because Al-Qaeda's there.
[02:36:22.372 --> 02:36:24.333]  Even though they publicly put them there.
[02:36:25.385 --> 02:36:27.647]  Right, you know, always at war, never at war.
[02:36:27.667 --> 02:36:31.669]  But the general public is in la-la land, is how they can get away with this, Aaron.
[02:36:32.330 --> 02:36:32.730]  I agree.
[02:36:33.471 --> 02:36:37.273]  And more on the Obama front, we've got the whole fight over coal.
[02:36:37.733 --> 02:36:42.717]  It was quietly published a day or two ago that the EPA is lining up brand new regulations.
[02:36:42.737 --> 02:36:52.944]  They're going to release them in that lame duck cycle, if Obama's not re-elected, to put new restrictions on the coal industry, try to push through all their green measures and everything.
[02:36:53.544 --> 02:36:54.825]  Hey, good for the sheeple.
[02:36:55.385 --> 02:36:57.326]  You like your power prices being increased?
[02:36:57.746 --> 02:36:58.786]  Your industry shut down?
[02:36:58.846 --> 02:37:00.927]  Then enjoy yourselves.
[02:37:01.548 --> 02:37:02.688]  Aaron Dykes, thank you so much.
[02:37:02.728 --> 02:37:03.949]  We'll talk to you again coming up soon.
[02:37:04.129 --> 02:37:05.109]  I'm cynical too, thanks.
[02:37:05.570 --> 02:37:06.250]  Oh, come on.
[02:37:06.690 --> 02:37:07.550]  These are good people.
[02:37:08.831 --> 02:37:12.253]  Thank goodness we've got such leaders that care about us and want to take good care of us.
[02:37:12.933 --> 02:37:15.554]  We take you now to Washington, D.C.
[02:37:15.814 --> 02:37:18.676]  and Wayne Madsen of waynemadsenreports.com.
[02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:28.757]  He worked in submarine warfare before joining the National Security Agency, and he's written for some of the biggest publications in the country and, well, reports daily from Capitol Hill.
[02:37:29.138 --> 02:37:31.019]  Wayne Madsen, good to have you here.
[02:37:31.099 --> 02:37:32.160]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:34.302]  Sorry we're behind a little bit tonight.
[02:37:34.322 --> 02:37:38.525]  We're having to kind of, you know, focus in here as we get more and more guests on on the time.
[02:37:39.205 --> 02:37:41.227]  But who are you calling for this election?
[02:37:41.567 --> 02:37:42.828]  What's your latest intel?
[02:37:42.888 --> 02:37:45.770]  What's your scoop on what really happened in Benghazi?
[02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:47.412]  We haven't talked to you in three or four months.
[02:37:47.812 --> 02:37:48.833]  It's good to have you back, Wayne.
[02:37:56.007 --> 02:37:57.568]  Yeah, we lost his audio.
[02:37:57.648 --> 02:38:01.592]  We'll try to get that potted up and see what happens.
[02:38:01.612 --> 02:38:02.613]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[02:38:02.913 --> 02:38:03.874]  Hey, good to have you.
[02:38:03.914 --> 02:38:04.794]  Good to have you with us.
[02:38:05.335 --> 02:38:06.075]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:38:06.436 --> 02:38:07.196]  Yes, I'm here.
[02:38:07.977 --> 02:38:08.417]  I'm here.
[02:38:08.978 --> 02:38:20.607]  Could you hear my lengthy question about... Okay, well, I... Yes, I heard it and I think it's too early to call this.
[02:38:20.648 --> 02:38:22.209]  This is going to be a close one because
[02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:27.804]  As we've heard before, there's a lot of...
[02:38:30.902 --> 02:38:32.203]  There's problems in voting.
[02:38:32.824 --> 02:38:39.089]  I think there's more problems in this election than we saw in 2008, and probably this is more like 2004.
[02:38:40.591 --> 02:38:46.636]  A lot of problems in Ohio with John Husted, the Secretary of State, Republican there.
[02:38:46.716 --> 02:38:51.700]  It looks like he's actually trying to become worse than Ken Blackwell was in 2004.
[02:38:52.381 --> 02:38:56.905]  I don't think we're going to really know the results of a lot of
[02:38:59.266 --> 02:39:02.087]  The Florida is too close.
[02:39:02.207 --> 02:39:03.468]  North Carolina is too close.
[02:39:03.788 --> 02:39:08.410]  And frankly, I saw I saw NBC call and CNN call South Carolina.
[02:39:11.012 --> 02:39:13.953]  I think they called that too soon because I'm looking at the results.
[02:39:14.474 --> 02:39:15.375]  From South Carolina.
[02:39:15.415 --> 02:39:26.407]  It's quite clear what I had been hearing earlier in the day that, you know, these Christian fundamentalist leaders said, oh, okay, we've been telling you Mormonism is a cult, but, you know, we've decided that it isn't now.
[02:39:26.427 --> 02:39:27.528]  You should go vote for Romney.
[02:39:27.568 --> 02:39:30.912]  So these people were Pentecostal, Southern Baptist, you know, they...
[02:39:33.086 --> 02:39:35.408]  Wayne, I want to be able to hear what you have to say.
[02:39:35.428 --> 02:39:36.830]  We're going to put Wayne on hold.
[02:39:37.170 --> 02:39:38.191]  We had good Skype.
[02:39:38.271 --> 02:39:43.016]  It's degraded down to like transmitting from the forbidden zone.
[02:39:43.457 --> 02:39:46.800]  So we're going to reconnect with Wayne because I really want to hear what he has to say.
[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:50.904]  But yeah, this is a very close election with fraud going on by both sides.
[02:39:50.944 --> 02:39:53.687]  I think we're seeing a clear image of that.
[02:39:56.806 --> 02:40:01.331]  Coming out, Obama has now admitted he has a concession speech ready.
[02:40:02.392 --> 02:40:06.257]  That is some breaking news out of CBS.
[02:40:06.898 --> 02:40:08.900]  Obama has a concession speech ready.
[02:40:09.060 --> 02:40:14.346]  AP expressing confidence but leaving nothing to chance, including having a concession speech ready.
[02:40:14.827 --> 02:40:16.929]  President Barack Obama indulges his
[02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:28.521]  Superstitions by engaging in a tradition of election day base basketball game with friends as the race that will determine his political future was finally in the hands of the voters.
[02:40:29.915 --> 02:40:39.297]  And what they do here is they imply that the puppet, Obama, Romney, you know, is really concerned here and doesn't know what's going to happen.
[02:40:40.798 --> 02:40:42.958]  And I guess when the fraud's this bad, they don't even know.
[02:40:42.978 --> 02:40:54.581]  I mean, it's just whoever can snatch and grab and run the most networks and announce who the winner is and have people can, you know, accept it and then have the Supreme Court say, and then that's the end of it.
[02:40:54.601 --> 02:40:55.541]  Do we have Wayne Madsen back?
[02:40:56.772 --> 02:40:58.153]  We do have audio back of Wayne.
[02:40:58.213 --> 02:40:59.234]  Wayne, start over.
[02:40:59.534 --> 02:41:05.517]  You're saying very close election, and we have seen a flip-flop by the Christian Evangelicals.
[02:41:06.398 --> 02:41:08.259]  Now they have been supporting Lord Romney.
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:13.422]  But, I mean, I just see it as two different types of poison.
[02:41:13.882 --> 02:41:16.444]  Either one is just another front man for the globalists.
[02:41:20.206 --> 02:41:21.227]  Your take on that, Wayne?
[02:41:22.136 --> 02:41:22.936]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:22.956 --> 02:41:23.296]  You know what?
[02:41:23.737 --> 02:41:24.697]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:41:24.717 --> 02:41:29.759]  And the reason I think I'm at the National Press Club and everybody's hogging up the Wi-Fi here.
[02:41:29.779 --> 02:41:32.680]  So that's why we're having some problems.
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:33.700]  Big crowd here tonight.
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:41.162]  But I don't think we're going to know because Ohio is like Ken Boole, 2004.
[02:41:41.222 --> 02:41:46.104]  Blackwell was the Secretary of State, Republican in 2004, was involved in a lot of fraud then.
[02:41:46.864 --> 02:41:48.685]  Election tabulation
[02:41:49.724 --> 02:41:51.665]  Problem, you know, machines flipping votes.
[02:41:51.685 --> 02:41:55.147]  And now we have John Husted, another Republican Secretary of State.
[02:41:55.527 --> 02:41:58.048]  Same thing.
[02:41:58.088 --> 02:41:59.609]  Uncertified software patches.
[02:41:59.949 --> 02:42:01.130]  All kinds of problems in Ohio.
[02:42:01.430 --> 02:42:02.330]  We're close in Florida.
[02:42:02.350 --> 02:42:05.972]  We got another situation there with Governor Rick Scott.
[02:42:06.752 --> 02:42:12.936]  Again, I mean, these guys not keep their hands off the election process.
[02:42:16.526 --> 02:42:20.527]  Look, Wayne, you're there at the National Press Club and people are hogging the Wi-Fi.
[02:42:20.627 --> 02:42:21.827]  It's usually clear from there.
[02:42:22.687 --> 02:42:24.228]  I would like to try your cell phone.
[02:42:25.528 --> 02:42:28.109]  But I don't know if that's going to be relayed or we're going to get that number.
[02:42:28.269 --> 02:42:30.749]  We've actually got his cell phone number in the computer.
[02:42:32.710 --> 02:42:37.631]  It's always good to have a backup number with things like this and we will see about getting him on.
[02:42:38.191 --> 02:42:41.071]  Let's go to a phone call while this is going on.
[02:42:43.837 --> 02:42:46.940]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in New York.
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:48.261]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:42:48.321 --> 02:42:48.661]  Welcome.
[02:42:48.681 --> 02:42:49.041]  Go ahead.
[02:42:51.123 --> 02:42:51.604]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:51.664 --> 02:42:53.185]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:42:54.786 --> 02:42:55.047]  Sure.
[02:42:55.827 --> 02:42:57.108]  Yeah, they're just messing with Wayne.
[02:42:57.128 --> 02:42:58.249]  We'll have to get Wayne on tomorrow.
[02:42:58.289 --> 02:42:58.770]  Thanks, guys.
[02:42:59.470 --> 02:42:59.951]  I like that.
[02:42:59.971 --> 02:43:00.571]  Three's the charm.
[02:43:00.591 --> 02:43:00.912]  We're done.
[02:43:01.352 --> 02:43:01.752]  Okay.
[02:43:02.113 --> 02:43:02.933]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:43:02.953 --> 02:43:03.414]  You're on the air.
[02:43:04.471 --> 02:43:04.871]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:05.051 --> 02:43:05.932]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:43:05.952 --> 02:43:07.533]  Just wanted to make an observation.
[02:43:07.553 --> 02:43:11.336]  I've been listening to you for about nine years now, and I'm more awake than ever.
[02:43:11.376 --> 02:43:14.838]  It's almost scary how much I am awake.
[02:43:15.118 --> 02:43:19.942]  When you're so awake, you can see everything from every angle, and it's just real hard for people to throw one by.
[02:43:20.102 --> 02:43:33.571]  I live in Florida, but up here in New York is where I'm originally from, and I've been up here for a few months, and I've been trying to educate my family about this global government and the new world order and just everything that's going on that we know is bad that all your listeners know is real and true.
[02:43:34.441 --> 02:43:41.107]  And I actually sat down with my family and had them watch the Obama deception from front to back, and it still amazed me.
[02:43:41.667 --> 02:43:55.959]  After having intelligent, articulate discussions about the New World Order, about globalization and all the plans, that they would still tower to vote for Mitt Romney and try to persuade me that what I was talking about was wrong, even though I could see it in their eyes, Alex.
[02:43:56.499 --> 02:44:04.160]  Well, that's because it gives them a venue to feel like they have power and that something simple can fix things.
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:14.202]  They'll understand it was a long, complex rat nest to get here, and it's going to be a long, complex rat nest to get out of this.
[02:44:15.122 --> 02:44:18.503]  And, you know, at least they're trying to be involved and trying to be informed.
[02:44:18.943 --> 02:44:22.243]  A lot of the population literally can't wait to get six feet under.
[02:44:22.323 --> 02:44:23.624]  I mean, they just don't even know.
[02:44:24.024 --> 02:44:25.664]  They can't find their butt with both hands.
[02:44:27.535 --> 02:44:28.276]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:44:28.296 --> 02:44:31.719]  But I just want to tell you, thank you for everything you've done over the last nine years.
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:37.545]  I'm going to pledge to you and all your listeners and everybody that's listening, I'm never going to give up in this fight for truth and reality.
[02:44:37.566 --> 02:44:39.387]  I'll never give in to tyranny and oppression.
[02:44:39.447 --> 02:44:41.410]  Just thank you, brother, from the bottom of my heart.
[02:44:41.570 --> 02:44:43.392]  Well, thank you, Mike, from New York.
[02:44:43.412 --> 02:44:44.453]  Let me ask one more question.
[02:44:45.394 --> 02:44:45.774]  I mean, look.
[02:44:46.895 --> 02:44:49.918]  We would already be in a much greater tyranny if people hadn't stood up.
[02:44:50.538 --> 02:45:00.867]  I mean, that's the history of civilization, is normal people that just want to live their lives and control-freak criminals that get a propaganda corps and start telling folks how great it is to be slaves.
[02:45:02.228 --> 02:45:05.992]  And so without you out there doing what you're doing, we wouldn't even have any future right now.
[02:45:07.113 --> 02:45:10.115]  And so as we conduct this filibuster here tonight against tyranny,
[02:45:11.741 --> 02:45:23.724]  You know, it is part of engaging the spectacle, engaging the fraud, but actually wading into the stench that we're able to wake people up.
[02:45:23.744 --> 02:45:29.966]  You know, there are a lot of people that know what's going on, but they kind of put white gloves on and stay back from it.
[02:45:30.706 --> 02:45:36.249]  And it's people like you, Mike, in New York and others around the country that are going to make it or break it.
[02:45:36.289 --> 02:45:37.090]  So understand this.
[02:45:37.650 --> 02:45:42.873]  Those that criticize those of us that are involved trying to wake people up and trying to fight tyranny and say, oh, there's no point.
[02:45:42.933 --> 02:45:43.653]  Oh, you're pathetic.
[02:45:43.673 --> 02:45:44.333]  Oh, what are you going to do?
[02:45:44.854 --> 02:45:49.676]  They don't realize it's those of us out there fighting that are holding all of this back.
[02:45:50.036 --> 02:45:52.358]  And the moment we ever give up and give in,
[02:45:53.058 --> 02:46:08.209]  You're going to get a Soviet-slash-Nazi-type nightmare as fast as you can turn around because there are millions of parasites and control freaks and dominators and bullies and sickos and...
[02:46:09.810 --> 02:46:24.159]  Filth that has a thousand different perversions and desires who want to be turned loose through a big government that siphoned off the energy of the good, hardworking people to build these juggernauts of domination.
[02:46:24.499 --> 02:46:27.321]  They want to have a heyday on us.
[02:46:28.161 --> 02:46:38.471]  And thank God for our forebearers in the Second Amendment that we have that bulwark that even if a small percentage ever resists during a true tyranny, we will defeat this enemy.
[02:46:38.831 --> 02:46:40.513]  So I salute our forebearers.
[02:46:40.553 --> 02:46:48.860]  They weren't perfect, but they were heads above other men in history, and so I salute them.
[02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:51.623]  But how are things going in your area of New York?
[02:46:53.639 --> 02:46:54.280]  Things are going good.
[02:46:54.300 --> 02:47:04.065]  I'm upstate in Albany, so we didn't really get hit by Sandy as much as some family down in Breezy Point in Brooklyn who got hit pretty hard, but they're making it through through the storms.
[02:47:04.125 --> 02:47:12.750]  My cousin down in Brooklyn said that FEMA's not being very cooperative and they're running real short on supplies and he's kind of fed up with the whole operation down there.
[02:47:12.770 --> 02:47:20.395]  Basically everything you've already been reporting is obviously accurate, but yeah, upstate New York hasn't felt the wrath just like New York City.
[02:47:20.915 --> 02:47:21.796]  God bless that, but
[02:47:23.015 --> 02:47:30.746]  Alex, it's amazing to me, and I wonder this all the time, what is it going to take for everybody to truly snap out of it and wake up?
[02:47:30.766 --> 02:47:33.470]  Do people truly really need to hit rock bottom?
[02:47:33.490 --> 02:47:35.673]  I was in the military from 2001 to 2007.
[02:47:35.834 --> 02:47:38.898]  I was in the Air Force and went to Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:47:39.759 --> 02:47:44.901]  I don't know if that has to happen, but it looks like it may have to happen in order for people to really understand what they're doing
[02:48:03.467 --> 02:48:04.848]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:48:04.928 --> 02:48:07.569]  And look, Afghans are tough people, as you know.
[02:48:07.609 --> 02:48:08.109]  You've been there.
[02:48:08.169 --> 02:48:11.431]  I haven't, but I've talked to family that's been there, and I've historically researched it.
[02:48:11.811 --> 02:48:13.712]  And Iraqis are pretty tough people.
[02:48:14.412 --> 02:48:15.993]  Americans used to be the toughest.
[02:48:16.153 --> 02:48:23.756]  I'm not saying Iraqis or Afghans are better than us, but liberty gave us such milk and honey that we've gotten pretty pampered.
[02:48:24.056 --> 02:48:30.279]  Can you imagine Americans for years living like Afghans or Iraqis do in war zones?
[02:48:31.059 --> 02:48:34.100]  I mean, do you think Americans are going to handle it as well as they do?
[02:48:36.021 --> 02:48:38.522]  As of right now, no, because it would be such a shock.
[02:48:38.903 --> 02:48:44.385]  It would be like the analogy of throwing a frog into a boiling pot of water from no water.
[02:48:44.445 --> 02:48:48.487]  You know, you can get the frog to die if you just put it in there lukewarm and gradually turn the heat up.
[02:48:48.767 --> 02:48:57.431]  But if you just land a shock like that, like if it was all of a sudden just martial law and all of a sudden no food in stores and all of a sudden no supplies anywhere, I mean,
[02:48:58.751 --> 02:49:01.593]  I don't even want to speculate, Alex, how bad that could actually be.
[02:49:02.494 --> 02:49:02.994]  Exactly.
[02:49:03.054 --> 02:49:04.715]  And that's a real possibility now.
[02:49:04.796 --> 02:49:06.797]  I mean, a depression is a fact.
[02:49:06.857 --> 02:49:07.317]  We're in it.
[02:49:07.397 --> 02:49:08.798]  The question is, how bad will it get?
[02:49:09.259 --> 02:49:12.041]  But a real breakdown is now in the cards.
[02:49:12.581 --> 02:49:19.486]  And all I know is, thank God I live in the country and got a pile of ammunition and guns under my butt and I know how to use them.
[02:49:20.566 --> 02:49:24.587]  I feel so bad for people in big, compact cities who don't know how to defend themselves.
[02:49:26.027 --> 02:49:28.708]  It's a very good chance things are going to get very, very nasty.
[02:49:29.028 --> 02:49:30.408]  God bless you and it's good to hear from you.
[02:49:30.448 --> 02:49:31.868]  Great caller there, Mike in New York.
[02:49:32.168 --> 02:49:36.769]  Now we have him, third time's the charm, joining us from the National Press Club, Wayne Madsen.
[02:49:36.789 --> 02:49:37.930]  Wayne, you've got the floor.
[02:49:37.970 --> 02:49:44.671]  I'm just going to shut up and let you roll on the election and then give us your take on what really happened in Benghazi and other points for the next 20 minutes.
[02:49:45.231 --> 02:49:48.312]  Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReports.com joins us, I hope.
[02:49:48.592 --> 02:49:49.552]  His cell phone works.
[02:49:49.572 --> 02:49:49.952]  Go ahead.
[02:49:50.473 --> 02:49:51.553]  Yes, I'm sorry.
[02:49:51.593 --> 02:49:59.855]  We've got a large crowd here all on their cell phones, chewing up the Wi-Fi here at the National Press Club downtown D.C.
[02:49:59.875 --> 02:50:04.797]  But it's very apparent that this was an election that was fraught with problems.
[02:50:05.778 --> 02:50:20.950]  Ohio, with the Secretary of State, Republican John Husted, real problems with installing uncertified patches to computers, loading computers in 39 Ohio counties.
[02:50:21.450 --> 02:50:24.873]  Although, Obama's ahead in Ohio right now.
[02:50:25.314 --> 02:50:25.834]  Who knows?
[02:50:26.314 --> 02:50:27.515]  That could change.
[02:50:27.956 --> 02:50:29.237]  I think looking
[02:50:29.937 --> 02:50:31.739]  I'm looking at some of the results too.
[02:50:32.999 --> 02:50:37.222]  I think the CNN and NBC called South Carolina way too soon.
[02:50:37.262 --> 02:50:38.543]  I'm looking at the results there.
[02:50:38.563 --> 02:50:46.289]  And what I was saying before, and I probably didn't get this all through, but we had these
[02:50:48.105 --> 02:51:03.756]  Christian fundamentalist churches for many, many years told their parishioners, their members, look, Mormonism is a cult, it's a terrible thing, don't get involved with it, and all of a sudden their leaders change their mind in this campaign and say,
[02:51:04.296 --> 02:51:06.757]  Oh well, Romney, you should vote for him.
[02:51:06.998 --> 02:51:08.598]  You know, bygones be bygones.
[02:51:08.678 --> 02:51:13.321]  Billy Graham scrubbed his website, got the cult business off of there about the Mormons.
[02:51:13.661 --> 02:51:22.786]  But you know, I don't think that really sunk in, because the voter turnout amongst these individuals, these Christian fundamentalists,
[02:51:23.706 --> 02:51:36.150]  Evangelicals in South Carolina was very, very low, and now you look at the results in South Carolina, and you see a lot of counties where Obama's ahead because of turnout.
[02:51:37.130 --> 02:51:48.594]  Now, of course, that's African Americans voting, but you've got a big African American turnout, and you have basically a lot of the white evangelicals that, to heck with it, were going to stay home.
[02:51:49.054 --> 02:51:58.278]  Another thing I've noticed, too, is the third-party candidates being spoilers in this election.
[02:51:58.918 --> 02:52:04.840]  Looking at Maine, where you would think that there might be libertarian support, I'm not seeing it from the results.
[02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:06.201]  I'm seeing maybe maximum 2%.
[02:52:07.441 --> 02:52:09.423]  Sure, let me raise this question.
[02:52:09.463 --> 02:52:10.263]  Right now, Romney wins.
[02:52:10.303 --> 02:52:14.366]  They're reporting Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi.
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:53.869]  North Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Obama wins, Connecticut wins, D.C., Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont,
[02:52:56.840 --> 02:52:58.886]  Trying to remember my abbreviations of states.
[02:52:58.926 --> 02:52:59.567]  What's WH?
[02:52:59.748 --> 02:53:01.994]  Are they already trying to say Wyoming?
[02:53:02.014 --> 02:53:02.515]  What's WH?
[02:53:04.915 --> 02:53:07.617]  Well they have him I think winning Wyoming.
[02:53:34.935 --> 02:53:37.079]  I mean, who do you think is really going to win here?
[02:53:38.686 --> 02:53:40.907]  Right now, I think it's way too close to call.
[02:53:40.987 --> 02:53:46.970]  I mean, there's no surprises in the states that Romney has won.
[02:53:46.990 --> 02:54:01.278]  Except, I think Virginia, I'm looking at the Virginia results, and Obama's not winning by the large majority that he got in 08 in Northern Virginia, where you've got a lot of the population.
[02:54:01.298 --> 02:54:06.081]  I don't see him, for example, Prince William County, which is
[02:54:06.901 --> 02:54:07.762]  Part of the D.C.
[02:54:07.822 --> 02:54:09.723]  suburbs in Northern Virginia.
[02:54:10.084 --> 02:54:11.065]  Romney's ahead there.
[02:54:11.125 --> 02:54:14.767]  I believe Obama carried that last time, not by much.
[02:54:15.228 --> 02:54:23.174]  But even the numbers in Arlington and Fairfax, it looks like there wasn't a big turnout.
[02:54:23.234 --> 02:54:25.696]  Of course, Obama's ahead, but he's not getting the numbers.
[02:54:26.197 --> 02:54:31.201]  And I would say that Virginia looks like one state that could go to Romney.
[02:54:31.903 --> 02:54:33.364]  Sure, let me expand on that.
[02:54:34.305 --> 02:54:43.911]  Just like we knew Obama was going to be bad four years ago, there's still a secret hope that maybe he'll actually try to be a president and things will get better because we can all hope.
[02:54:44.672 --> 02:54:45.912]  It's the same thing with Romney.
[02:54:46.233 --> 02:54:51.556]  I think a lot of Americans are going to vote for Romney just because they're desperately hitting a reset button.
[02:54:51.576 --> 02:54:57.980]  Kind of like a lot of Republicans voted for Obama, a lot of Democrats are going to end up voting for Romney.
[02:54:58.281 --> 02:55:01.043]  But then there's all the fraud involved, so who even knows?
[02:55:01.903 --> 02:55:05.545]  What do you think about that point about just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic?
[02:55:05.985 --> 02:55:09.908]  People are getting desperate here and, you know, I saw the polls.
[02:55:09.968 --> 02:55:15.151]  I don't just believe polls, but I looked at a wide spectrum of scientific polls last month.
[02:55:15.211 --> 02:55:17.092]  I mean, Romney was winning the popular vote.
[02:55:17.372 --> 02:55:19.333]  He was starting to get ahead in some swing states.
[02:55:19.674 --> 02:55:23.096]  Then the hurricane came and suddenly some of those gains were lost.
[02:55:23.116 --> 02:55:28.459]  But again, we objectively tend to look at polls and voting numbers as if they're real.
[02:55:29.259 --> 02:55:30.481]  You work for the NSA.
[02:55:30.501 --> 02:55:32.303]  I mean, you've worked in computer science.
[02:55:32.323 --> 02:55:33.604]  You know about election fraud, Wayne.
[02:55:33.624 --> 02:55:34.285]  You've talked about it.
[02:55:34.946 --> 02:55:36.467]  What do you think the truth is?
[02:55:36.507 --> 02:55:42.494]  I mean, in a kingdom of lies, I mean, I'm saying the public can't find their butt with both hands.
[02:55:43.375 --> 02:55:47.319]  You know, I mean, how can anybody find anything in this storm, this fog of war?
[02:55:50.219 --> 02:56:03.425]  Well, I think the fact is that the Secretaries of State, who are also like heads of their campaigns, the presidential campaigns for their states, I think that's a conflict of interest.
[02:56:03.885 --> 02:56:08.126]  I think we have to make the Secretary of State job a non-partisan position.
[02:56:09.127 --> 02:56:16.110]  We saw what happened with Ken Blackwell in 2004 in Ohio, and the wonderful Katherine Harris
[02:56:16.710 --> 02:56:18.772]  I remember her in Florida in 2000.
[02:56:18.832 --> 02:56:27.139]  Both these individuals were officials, co-chairs of the Bush campaign.
[02:56:27.859 --> 02:56:31.122]  This job is much too important to have political hacks in there.
[02:56:31.422 --> 02:56:43.472]  And as far as these electronic voting machines, these companies that run these machines and run these elections are tied to one particular party for the most part.
[02:56:43.972 --> 02:57:00.344]  And we've got one outfit in Ohio that's very much connected to the intelligence community, to Booz Allen and Hamilton, this company called Seidel, which is actually headquartered in Barcelona, Spain.
[02:57:00.444 --> 02:57:01.265]  So what are we doing now?
[02:57:01.285 --> 02:57:04.668]  Are we outsourcing our elections overseas?
[02:57:05.148 --> 02:57:08.691]  There's got to be a clean... They've got to clean this mess up.
[02:57:09.111 --> 02:57:12.934]  They've got to get the political hacks out of the Secretary of State jobs.
[02:57:14.515 --> 02:57:24.482]  You know, just make them non-partisan and get these private companies out of the picture because we know how they can throw these elections.
[02:57:24.922 --> 02:57:32.527]  And although Ohio, I'm noticing that Obama's still ahead in Ohio, we've seen this kind of thing change.
[02:57:34.188 --> 02:57:36.230]  And Florida is going back and forth.
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:50.187]  What about delays in New Jersey and New York and people mailing in their internet ballots or emailing them in and talk of the election commissions keeping voting going the next few days.
[02:57:50.247 --> 02:58:00.773]  I mean with that, like we get a closed election and suddenly New York or New Jersey is out there contested or some other state and then what about all these calls after you talk about that for civil unrest.
[02:58:00.793 --> 02:58:01.974]  We've seen Michael Moore
[02:58:02.754 --> 02:58:08.542]  You know, putting out videos of people saying, if Romney gets elected, we'll burn this mother-effer down.
[02:58:09.383 --> 02:58:10.284]  Excuse my French.
[02:58:10.364 --> 02:58:17.274]  And then we've got classic race baiting by Bill Maher saying, hey, blacks are going to hunt down whites.
[02:58:17.334 --> 02:58:19.817]  I mean, just incredible stuff.
[02:58:20.938 --> 02:58:23.839]  That is such, that I think is racist towards black people.
[02:58:24.599 --> 02:58:32.621]  You know, like having the weird white commentator saying, you go get the whitey, you know, if our guy doesn't get elected.
[02:58:33.001 --> 02:58:35.441]  You know, almost like you sick a dog on somebody.
[02:58:35.481 --> 02:58:41.343]  And it seems like that's what these poverty pimps on the George Soros bandwagon are doing.
[02:58:41.843 --> 02:58:42.783]  What's your take on that?
[02:58:43.598 --> 02:58:55.080]  Well, I think there's, you know, I mean, you hear a lot of people here in Washington talk about how politics has just become such a blood sport now that, you know, nobody can get along with the other side.
[02:58:55.640 --> 02:59:10.383]  And, you know, they talk about, look, you know, when Lyndon Johnson was president, he was a Democrat committed, but, you know, he got his legislation through by inviting the Senate minority leader, Everett Dirksen, up to the White House so they could get drunk together.
[02:59:10.403 --> 02:59:12.664]  And then they passed legislation to figure out how to get the
[02:59:13.224 --> 02:59:19.207]  Civil rights and voting rights and all these other bills passed, and that's been largely lost.
[02:59:19.267 --> 02:59:23.089]  Even Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill used to get together and cut these deals.
[02:59:23.169 --> 02:59:26.111]  Now, I don't see that changing.
[02:59:26.131 --> 02:59:32.034]  Whether Romney or Obama is the president for the next four years, I think this well is poisoned here.
[02:59:32.074 --> 02:59:36.677]  So, obviously you're going to get these rhetorical flourishes by people from both sides.
[02:59:37.797 --> 02:59:40.519]  You know, get people all hot under the collar.
[02:59:41.159 --> 02:59:44.340]  And, uh, but, you know, Michael Moore, I mean, he's a blowhard.
[02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:52.703]  He, you know, I mean, you know, he's trying to expose some things with some of his documentaries, but, you know, look, these guys have to remain relevant.
[02:59:52.723 --> 02:59:55.484]  Why does Ann Coulter always say these awful things?
[02:59:55.524 --> 03:00:00.265]  So she gets invited back onto these programs because, you know, if she doesn't, you know,
[03:00:02.126 --> 03:00:05.810]  In a couple years she's just going to be considered some has-been in an old bag, you know?
[03:00:06.290 --> 03:00:12.036]  And they're not going to care about her anymore, so people have to... So a lot of it is they just say radical things for attention.
[03:00:12.056 --> 03:00:16.640]  Alright, I want to give you the floor for the ten minutes we have or so, then we're going to get an update.
[03:00:17.521 --> 03:00:20.944]  From our own David Knight, and also take some phone calls.
[03:00:20.964 --> 03:00:22.766]  We're going to open the phone system up again.
[03:00:22.786 --> 03:00:28.831]  The number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[03:00:29.191 --> 03:00:30.472]  Have you seen election fraud?
[03:00:30.492 --> 03:00:33.334]  Have you seen numbers flipped for Obama or Romney?
[03:00:33.735 --> 03:00:35.776]  We'd like to hear your reports here.
[03:00:35.796 --> 03:00:38.418]  I think we have Atame Co.
[03:00:38.478 --> 03:00:38.959]  or something.
[03:00:38.979 --> 03:00:40.940]  I have to learn how to read English here in a minute.
[03:00:41.801 --> 03:00:43.623]  Atame, we're going to get to him and others here.
[03:00:43.663 --> 03:00:45.764]  But I want to give you the floor, Wayne.
[03:00:46.685 --> 03:00:49.227]  Uh, here for you to give us, because I don't even know what your take is.
[03:00:49.987 --> 03:00:52.288]  What is your take on what happened in Benghazi?
[03:00:52.328 --> 03:00:57.251]  Was it a hit of the ambassador because he wasn't going along with arms deals to Syria?
[03:00:57.271 --> 03:01:08.078]  Uh, I had heard this line by people I respect, uh, that it was a neocon hit to embarrass Obama, but now we learn it's seven hours Obama knew in order to stand down that we're leaving generals.
[03:01:08.458 --> 03:01:10.079]  I don't know what the truth is about this.
[03:01:10.199 --> 03:01:11.481]  Wayne, I know you have a lot of sources.
[03:01:11.942 --> 03:01:18.873]  What is your breakdown on Benghazi, the upcoming Iran attack, what's happening in Syria that you visited, what's going on in Libya?
[03:01:19.354 --> 03:01:21.458]  Give us 10 minutes on your geopolitical breakdown.
[03:01:22.122 --> 03:01:26.945]  Yeah, you know, there's several places around the globe where you look at the U.S.
[03:01:27.025 --> 03:01:30.347]  Embassy staff, and normally it's the Deputy Chief of Mission.
[03:01:31.088 --> 03:01:32.409]  They wear two hats.
[03:01:32.529 --> 03:01:34.270]  Yeah, they're with the State Department.
[03:01:34.930 --> 03:01:36.451]  They may be Deputy Chief of Mission.
[03:01:36.491 --> 03:01:37.972]  They may be even Ambassador.
[03:01:38.413 --> 03:01:41.675]  Yet, at the same time, they're working for another agency.
[03:01:41.715 --> 03:01:43.176]  And, you know, we all know who that is.
[03:01:43.973 --> 03:01:48.615]  The good old Black Knights of the Potomac up in Langley.
[03:01:48.936 --> 03:01:51.097]  And I'm looking at Stevenson's background.
[03:01:51.717 --> 03:02:01.262]  I think it's highly likely that yes, he was an ambassador, but I also think he was acting as a CIA agent over in Benghazi.
[03:02:01.322 --> 03:02:03.323]  I think he was definitely involved in
[03:02:04.663 --> 03:02:13.327]  We know, arming the rebels, and there was this attempt, obviously, to buy back or get back these shoulder-launched missiles.
[03:02:13.808 --> 03:02:28.935]  And I think Stevens, when they used to throw diplomats out of other countries during the Cold War, they'd say, well, we're throwing out this ambassador or this deputy chief of mission because their activities were not in concert with their diplomatic
[03:02:32.616 --> 03:02:38.380]  They're diplomatic status, and they were declared persona non grata.
[03:02:38.420 --> 03:02:52.128]  And I basically think that whatever Stevens was involved with, it became very well known to these terrorists, these radicals, who he may have been dealing with, that he was more than just an ambassador.
[03:02:52.428 --> 03:02:53.469]  I think he was targeted.
[03:02:53.749 --> 03:02:58.552]  And I think the reason that the military was told to stand down is, look, the military
[03:02:59.353 --> 03:03:05.698]  We know that stove piping still goes on between the Pentagon and the CIA.
[03:03:06.159 --> 03:03:09.522]  And, you know, if the CIA is up to something, they don't want the military involved.
[03:03:09.582 --> 03:03:11.243]  And I think that's what we had in Benghazi.
[03:03:11.563 --> 03:03:17.628]  I think this was a CIA operation, and I don't care how many Marines were off the coast, they were not going to be called in.
[03:03:18.029 --> 03:03:24.614]  And again, Obama, basically, you know, this gets back to what I wrote, this guy comes from the CIA family.
[03:03:25.255 --> 03:03:26.115]  He has a background.
[03:03:26.155 --> 03:03:27.196]  He knows when he's
[03:03:28.357 --> 03:03:30.399]  Uh, responsible for his CIA operation.
[03:03:30.439 --> 03:03:31.940]  He's not going to say a word about it.
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:37.304]  And, you know, he'll remain silent for seven hours, eight hours, or, you know, however long it takes.
[03:03:37.745 --> 03:03:41.428]  And he'll, um, you know, he'll sandbag the military at the same time.
[03:03:41.708 --> 03:03:42.889]  And I think that's what we saw here.
[03:03:48.741 --> 03:03:53.925]  So Benghazi, I think, was, you know, we don't know what the details are yet.
[03:03:54.405 --> 03:04:00.310]  Obviously, now we know that the Libyan rebels are the biggest source of money and arms for the Syrian rebels.
[03:04:01.351 --> 03:04:05.154]  You know, somebody ought to lose their job over bringing down Qaddafi.
[03:04:05.174 --> 03:04:11.539]  He might not have been a great guy, but, you know, he did keep these radical Islamists out of Libya.
[03:04:11.899 --> 03:04:15.782]  He tried to tell us, look, why in the world are you supporting al-Qaeda?
[03:04:17.003 --> 03:04:21.847]  You know, they're trying to oust me and now we've got President Assad in Syria saying the same thing.
[03:04:22.188 --> 03:04:24.450]  What are you going to turn over Syria to these guys?
[03:04:25.010 --> 03:04:30.115]  You know, it's time to play hardball with the Saudis and the Qataris who support these people.
[03:04:30.495 --> 03:04:35.960]  But, you know, Hillary Clinton, she fell in love with these radicals.
[03:04:36.600 --> 03:04:38.982]  And, uh, I think she has to be called to account.
[03:04:39.022 --> 03:04:59.279]  I think this was her operation, um, and I think she knew darn well, uh, that Stevens, uh, was, uh, wearing two hats, that he was, yes, he was an ambassador, ostensibly and officially a diplomat, but we know many, many places where the ambassadors or the deputy chief of mission is also, uh, working for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:05:00.543 --> 03:05:01.904]  Well, you know, here's my issue.
[03:05:01.924 --> 03:05:02.925]  You're up there in D.C.
[03:05:02.945 --> 03:05:05.227]  You're talking to the media and other sources.
[03:05:06.127 --> 03:05:07.408]  I mean, I've studied history.
[03:05:07.508 --> 03:05:10.571]  I've been on air for 17 years, but I don't think I know a lot.
[03:05:11.431 --> 03:05:13.753]  In fact, I know enough to know I don't know much.
[03:05:15.154 --> 03:05:23.580]  But it does seem the ruling class is becoming more and more decadent, more and more disconnected from reality, to think that they can
[03:05:24.502 --> 03:05:26.103]  You know, put Al-Qaeda in charge.
[03:05:26.143 --> 03:05:27.824]  I'm sure you saw it in the newspapers today.
[03:05:27.844 --> 03:05:31.926]  And have Hillary come out and say, we've got to invade Syria because Al-Qaeda's there.
[03:05:32.486 --> 03:05:38.289]  When the West, on record, put them there, and you've recently visited, along with Dr. Tarbley, who's coming up.
[03:05:39.369 --> 03:05:45.933]  I mean, sure, even if the brain-dead American people, on average, are buying that, the rest of the world is saying, who are these lunatics?
[03:05:47.054 --> 03:05:55.144]  Uh, and I understand they're all up there showing off to each other in DC and walking around in the big marble buildings, feeling like they're all Darth Vader.
[03:05:55.404 --> 03:05:56.886]  But these guys aren't Darth Vader.
[03:05:56.926 --> 03:05:57.948]  Darth Vader isn't real.
[03:05:57.968 --> 03:06:02.974]  Uh, and I've studied enough history to know that power elites always become megalomaniacs.
[03:06:03.675 --> 03:06:04.996]  And then that's right when they fall.
[03:06:05.397 --> 03:06:08.400]  I don't care how much Google spying software they've got.
[03:06:09.761 --> 03:06:15.106]  I see this whole thing really retrograding, rotting very quickly.
[03:06:15.146 --> 03:06:19.590]  Give me your take on geopolitically where the American empire is.
[03:06:20.615 --> 03:06:23.777]  Well, I'll tell you, I was in Beijing for most of September.
[03:06:23.957 --> 03:06:39.484]  I was in China, Beijing, Guangzhou, and I was talking to Chinese government people, and they were saying, you know, why is Hillary Clinton over here all the time rattling sabers on our borders?
[03:06:39.584 --> 03:06:47.388]  And it's quite clear that this pivot to Asia is another attempt to extend or maintain U.S.
[03:06:47.968 --> 03:06:48.569]  influence
[03:06:49.629 --> 03:06:50.769]  Yeah, what is that about?
[03:06:50.789 --> 03:06:54.291]  Japan doesn't do anything it's not told to do by the globalists.
[03:06:54.311 --> 03:07:00.172]  Why is Japan, I'm not against Japan, I don't have a dog in this fight, why is Japan picking a fight with China?
[03:07:19.232 --> 03:07:27.635]  Well, it's historical, but also Japan lost its number two economic power status to China.
[03:07:27.775 --> 03:07:31.276]  China is now the world's second largest economic power.
[03:07:31.316 --> 03:07:31.596]  The U.S.
[03:07:31.676 --> 03:07:32.677]  is still first place.
[03:07:32.737 --> 03:07:35.278]  I don't think that's going to hold very long.
[03:07:35.318 --> 03:07:45.021]  I think China is well on its way to becoming the largest economic power, but Japan feels like they got bested by the Chinese, and so all these old
[03:07:47.862 --> 03:07:48.423]  We're good.
[03:08:02.905 --> 03:08:03.646]  We're good to go.
[03:08:20.739 --> 03:08:33.409]  It's better to make a deal with the Japanese, we get in there, we know them, than seeing a Chinese national oil company start to drill for oil and natural gas in these islands.
[03:08:34.209 --> 03:08:44.137]  So it's down to the basic common denominator, oil, why did we invade Iraq, oil, why are we in the Persian Gulf, oil.
[03:08:44.742 --> 03:08:47.804]  All right, Wayne Madsen, you're saying too close to call.
[03:08:48.565 --> 03:08:51.166]  We'll have to watch it throughout the night and tomorrow.
[03:08:52.147 --> 03:08:55.869]  Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:08:56.350 --> 03:08:57.530]  Okay, watch Florida.
[03:08:57.550 --> 03:09:00.693]  There's only about a 2,000 vote difference right now.
[03:09:02.974 --> 03:09:03.975]  What's your gut tell you?
[03:09:03.995 --> 03:09:07.057]  I know you don't like to go on a limb, but I mean, do you think Romney's going to win?
[03:09:08.600 --> 03:09:11.563]  I think we're not going to know until the wee hours of the morning.
[03:09:11.603 --> 03:09:17.087]  I think Hawaii will report in for Obama, and we still won't know who won this election.
[03:09:17.167 --> 03:09:22.190]  I think we're looking at 7, 8 in the morning, and I'm not even counting court challenges.
[03:09:22.230 --> 03:09:25.333]  We could see court challenges in a number of states.
[03:09:25.433 --> 03:09:28.095]  Florida, frankly, is as close now as it was in 2000.
[03:09:28.235 --> 03:09:29.996]  Oh yeah, no, no, I agree.
[03:09:30.056 --> 03:09:33.819]  My gut, just looking at this, says this is going to get drug out for a while.
[03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:35.320]  Yeah, we're not going to know.
[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:36.081]  We're not going to know.
[03:09:36.121 --> 03:09:37.442]  I think this is going to be a long night.
[03:09:38.436 --> 03:09:40.617]  Okay, thank you so much, Wayne Madsen.
[03:09:41.537 --> 03:09:42.017]  Thanks, Alec.
[03:09:42.357 --> 03:09:44.538]  Yeah, I think we've gotten some of the best info of the night.
[03:09:44.578 --> 03:09:48.899]  It's all been excellent with Gerald Cilente, Max Keiser, and now, of course, Wayne Madsen.
[03:09:48.939 --> 03:09:59.802]  We're going to go to a report with David Knight, and then we're going to come back and take some of your phone calls and get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:09:59.862 --> 03:10:02.102]  We're already 30 minutes behind, aren't we?
[03:10:02.182 --> 03:10:04.663]  It's time to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on right now, isn't it?
[03:10:06.482 --> 03:10:06.922]  Yes, it is.
[03:10:06.962 --> 03:10:14.964]  Okay, let's do a quick five-minute report with David Knight, and then Jakari Jackson's coming in, because we've got to get back on schedule.
[03:10:15.004 --> 03:10:15.764]  Let Roberts know.
[03:10:15.784 --> 03:10:21.285]  Let's go ahead and get Roberts on the line here, former head of policy at the Department of Treasury.
[03:10:21.345 --> 03:10:24.686]  I really want to hear what he has to say about all this and the economy.
[03:10:25.126 --> 03:10:27.486]  And then we'll take calls, and then Jakari Jackson.
[03:10:28.306 --> 03:10:29.047]  So that's coming up.
[03:10:29.087 --> 03:10:30.367]  And then Lou Rockwell, because
[03:10:31.027 --> 03:10:32.108]  These guests have been so great.
[03:10:32.148 --> 03:10:36.070]  We've been going over a few minutes with them over the last four hours or so.
[03:10:36.090 --> 03:10:40.012]  Yeah, it's been almost four hours, but now you know what happens with time.
[03:10:40.052 --> 03:10:43.574]  The more you get behind, the more you get behind, and pretty soon it adds up.
[03:10:43.614 --> 03:10:47.076]  So we're going to throw you to the other studio and the great InfoWars crew.
[03:10:47.737 --> 03:10:49.518]  They're supporting David Knight.
[03:10:49.858 --> 03:10:53.940]  We've also got reporters on the ground as well who we'll be popping in with.
[03:10:53.980 --> 03:10:58.303]  David Knight, what's the latest on the election numbers we've got here in the United States?
[03:10:59.667 --> 03:11:05.103]  Alex, it looks like we've got about 153 electoral votes right now for Romney, 143 for Obama.
[03:11:07.828 --> 03:11:10.831]  It's hanging pretty close to the popular vote, about 50 to 48.
[03:11:11.811 --> 03:11:13.032]  We don't know about that missing 2%.
[03:11:13.533 --> 03:11:15.594]  They don't report what third-party candidates get.
[03:11:16.195 --> 03:11:23.981]  It'd be interesting to see that, because we know that Johnson is hoping to get 5%, because that would change a lot of things in terms of ballot access.
[03:11:24.001 --> 03:11:34.010]  It would open up federal matching funds, which are things that, especially the ballot access issue, is a way that they control the election and control, make sure their voices aren't heard.
[03:11:36.432 --> 03:11:39.055]  Other than that, it's shaping up pretty much as we expected.
[03:11:39.075 --> 03:11:46.443]  I think, looking at the map here, South Carolina and most of the South is being called for Romney.
[03:11:46.683 --> 03:11:48.805]  North Carolina and Virginia, they have not called yet.
[03:11:51.019 --> 03:11:53.640]  So those are pretty close, as well as Florida.
[03:11:53.680 --> 03:11:54.741]  Those polls have been closed.
[03:11:54.781 --> 03:11:56.462]  All three of those states for quite some time.
[03:11:56.622 --> 03:11:58.322]  And New Hampshire still not being called.
[03:11:58.382 --> 03:12:00.984]  All those have been closed for some time.
[03:12:01.004 --> 03:12:02.064]  Florida's neck and neck.
[03:12:02.084 --> 03:12:06.826]  So this is going basically with what had been predicted by the pollsters and computers.
[03:12:06.846 --> 03:12:12.509]  But it won't really matter, I guess, whenever states like California and others go to Obama.
[03:12:12.789 --> 03:12:18.612]  So you're saying if it's following the line of reasoning we saw previously, does that put Romney in, or is it still too close to tell?
[03:12:19.662 --> 03:12:21.183]  It looks like it's still too close to tell.
[03:12:21.744 --> 03:12:27.069]  You know, the votes are still coming in and we've got a lot to hear from out West.
[03:12:27.209 --> 03:12:28.690]  Ohio is still a toss-up.
[03:12:29.831 --> 03:12:31.332]  They haven't called that yet for anybody.
[03:12:32.543 --> 03:12:33.364]  So we're still waiting to see.
[03:12:33.404 --> 03:12:37.887]  The other thing is that it looks like things aren't going to change as far as the Senate and House goes.
[03:12:38.948 --> 03:12:46.274]  It looks like things are trending towards the Democrats keeping control of the Senate, Republicans keeping control of the House.
[03:12:48.136 --> 03:12:51.559]  But that could change, I guess, the dynamics quite a bit if Romney gets in.
[03:12:51.719 --> 03:12:52.359]  He's going to have
[03:12:53.380 --> 03:12:58.885]  Well, my concern is, if it is a contested election, and it's not just my view, it's many people's view that have studied this, and I want your take on it briefly here, David.
[03:13:18.081 --> 03:13:22.831]  If it's contested and lawyers get involved, that's when you may see civil unrest by both sides.
[03:13:23.272 --> 03:13:26.237]  You know, right-wingers are the types that might...
[03:13:27.697 --> 03:13:30.599]  Shoot some things up, things like that.
[03:13:30.879 --> 03:13:36.402]  We'll kind of see the liberals classically like to burn things down and run around looting and beating old ladies over the head.
[03:13:36.983 --> 03:13:46.668]  So there's no telling, but I tell you, more and more just looking at it, where they're talking about, well, they're already saying in New York and New Jersey they're going to extend voting through Friday.
[03:13:46.688 --> 03:13:52.892]  So if those states are contested or needed in this vote, then we see this going on for a while.
[03:13:52.932 --> 03:13:54.393]  This is going to become quite a spectacle.
[03:13:55.143 --> 03:13:55.423]  Oh yeah.
[03:13:55.563 --> 03:14:01.028]  Well, you know, you think back to the election where Florida was contested and went on for so long.
[03:14:02.089 --> 03:14:05.132]  I think that people are still very angry about that on the left.
[03:14:05.833 --> 03:14:07.114]  That's kind of been simmering there.
[03:14:07.154 --> 03:14:12.359]  I think that's a lot of what you're seeing with these tweets threatening Romney with physical violence.
[03:14:12.419 --> 03:14:14.601]  But yeah, I think that there's a very good chance that
[03:14:15.180 --> 03:14:15.681]  That could erupt.
[03:14:15.701 --> 03:14:18.103]  I think there's a very good chance there could be a false flag attack.
[03:14:18.163 --> 03:14:23.787]  That would be something that, you know, the government is always looking for some way to, you know, declare an emergency or seize power.
[03:14:24.228 --> 03:14:24.748]  Exactly.
[03:14:24.788 --> 03:14:30.173]  They could say some right-winger blows up a federal building and Obama's got to take over for our safety.
[03:14:30.553 --> 03:14:34.316]  I tell you, we are in one of those critical times, though, when so much historically happens.
[03:14:34.997 --> 03:14:35.177]  Yeah.
[03:14:35.437 --> 03:14:35.717]  Oh, yeah.
[03:14:35.938 --> 03:14:36.338]  Absolutely.
[03:14:37.679 --> 03:14:37.839]  Yeah.
[03:14:39.258 --> 03:14:42.602]  Right now they're, oh, look at this, they just changed the electoral count.
[03:14:42.642 --> 03:14:44.644]  They've got Obama up now for the first time.
[03:14:44.664 --> 03:14:47.908]  157 to 153 over Romney right now.
[03:14:49.390 --> 03:14:51.012]  What is it that just flipped here, Rob?
[03:14:51.032 --> 03:14:51.653]  Did you see which...
[03:14:52.947 --> 03:14:59.394]  Oh, it looks like they put Wisconsin in Obama's column, so that flipped it up to put him just slightly ahead of Romney.
[03:15:00.235 --> 03:15:01.957]  Oh yeah, that's a key battleground state.
[03:15:01.997 --> 03:15:08.565]  So President Obama getting closer every minute to his four more years, which I dread either way.
[03:15:08.585 --> 03:15:10.807]  You know, it's really crazy to dread it either way.
[03:15:11.468 --> 03:15:16.513]  To think whether you're going to be dropped a thousand feet under razor blades or spikes.
[03:15:17.013 --> 03:15:17.994]  It really doesn't matter.
[03:15:18.314 --> 03:15:22.939]  Well, we may do one more update with you after some calls with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts here in a moment.
[03:15:22.959 --> 03:15:26.462]  Then Jakari Jackson is coming in to continue to give us the numbers.
[03:15:27.062 --> 03:15:28.183]  David Knight, thank you so much.
[03:15:28.624 --> 03:15:28.944]  Thank you.
[03:15:29.625 --> 03:15:33.428]  All right, we go now to the former head of policy at the Department of the Treasury.
[03:15:34.289 --> 03:15:41.492]  The father of Reaganomics, accomplished economist, and he also, of course, is a syndicated columnist.
[03:15:41.652 --> 03:15:48.055]  He's been the editor at the Wall Street Journal, and he writes great articles at his website that we'll be putting on screen.
[03:15:48.075 --> 03:15:53.417]  We also carry them in our monthly magazine and at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:15:53.437 --> 03:15:57.198]  For our regular viewers, he needs no introduction, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:15:57.539 --> 03:16:00.860]  Well, I could ask a lot of questions, Doc, but I'd love to throw this at you.
[03:16:01.380 --> 03:16:03.701]  Out of the gates, what's on your mind first up?
[03:16:04.021 --> 03:16:06.002]  The election, or is it a diversion?
[03:16:06.502 --> 03:16:08.863]  What's happening in the economic realm?
[03:16:08.923 --> 03:16:10.264]  What's on Dr. Roberts' mind?
[03:16:12.024 --> 03:16:25.130]  Well, you know, what's on my mind right now is that it doesn't really matter, from the standpoint of the American people, which of these two candidates wins, because they're both for war, they're both for the police state,
[03:16:26.289 --> 03:16:33.735]  And all the two parties are fighting over Alex is who gets to be the whore for the interest groups.
[03:16:34.796 --> 03:16:47.606]  If you get to be the party that wins the election gets to be the whore for the Israel lobby, for Wall Street, for the military security complex, for agribusiness, for oil, timber, and mine.
[03:16:48.227 --> 03:16:49.368]  And that's very lucrative.
[03:16:50.265 --> 03:16:57.629]  Because when you get through serving those people, they reward you with huge incomes and wealth.
[03:16:58.289 --> 03:17:01.911]  And so the two parties are really fighting over who gets to be the prostitute.
[03:17:02.651 --> 03:17:05.693]  And the American people are deluded.
[03:17:05.713 --> 03:17:09.214]  They think there's some kind of policy difference between the parties.
[03:17:09.234 --> 03:17:10.875]  There's not any policy difference.
[03:17:11.916 --> 03:17:18.659]  From that standpoint, it doesn't matter who wins, except that the Republicans, I think, are meaner.
[03:17:19.890 --> 03:17:25.031]  They have no compassion for ordinary people.
[03:17:25.071 --> 03:17:26.091]  They've got theirs.
[03:17:27.252 --> 03:17:28.172]  And they're just mean.
[03:17:29.132 --> 03:17:30.252]  And mean-spirited.
[03:17:30.413 --> 03:17:37.654]  And so the policy won't be any different, whether Romney wins or Obama.
[03:17:37.974 --> 03:17:45.936]  But the mean-spiritedness of the Republicans will be very pronounced.
[03:17:47.737 --> 03:17:48.797]  And you know, if you look at
[03:17:50.134 --> 03:18:00.705]  At the two of them, the only other difference is that Romney has already been to Israel, crawling on his belly, groveling.
[03:18:01.525 --> 03:18:10.607]  Supposedly we're a superpower, but here is the man who wants to be president, and he's crawling on his belly in the ground, kissing Netanyahu's feet.
[03:18:11.188 --> 03:18:14.488]  Well, at least Obama had more dignity than to do that.
[03:18:14.969 --> 03:18:16.469]  He only bows to the Saudi king.
[03:18:16.889 --> 03:18:23.651]  Perhaps Romney should publicly kiss Netanyahu's butt, and then he can be elected.
[03:18:25.011 --> 03:18:26.192]  That's the only real difference.
[03:18:26.212 --> 03:18:34.537]  Maybe that's the new swearing in, it's not a Bible, but Netanyahu bends over and then, I'm sorry, you shouldn't have got me going there.
[03:18:37.539 --> 03:18:40.141]  But really, you see, that's the difference.
[03:18:42.151 --> 03:18:48.153]  All over the internet, you know, for years, we've had all this Karl Rove propaganda.
[03:18:48.173 --> 03:18:49.994]  The Republicans send it to each other.
[03:18:51.194 --> 03:18:55.956]  It never has any source or site, but Obama is a Marxist.
[03:18:56.416 --> 03:18:57.676]  Obama is a Muslim.
[03:18:58.517 --> 03:19:05.259]  And the people who send this, they don't have enough sense to understand that if he's a Muslim, why is he killing Muslims in seven countries?
[03:19:07.551 --> 03:19:11.152]  If even Marxists wanted Wall Street and the Israel lobby, put him in the White House.
[03:19:12.012 --> 03:19:13.773]  It's just all so absurd.
[03:19:13.813 --> 03:19:16.853]  The American people have a clue about anything that affects them.
[03:19:17.914 --> 03:19:28.756]  And as I say, the policy won't be any different, whether Obama's in there or Romney, any more than it may be any difference between Bush and Obama.
[03:19:28.776 --> 03:19:31.117]  Alright, but who do you think they're getting ready to put in, though?
[03:19:32.814 --> 03:19:36.616]  I don't think they care because whoever they put in, they control.
[03:19:36.836 --> 03:19:37.637]  They own them both.
[03:19:37.957 --> 03:19:40.978]  So it's like Don King owning both boxers or all the horses.
[03:19:40.998 --> 03:19:42.459]  Okay, so let me shift gears then.
[03:19:42.819 --> 03:19:45.501]  What's happening in the economy since we talked a couple months ago?
[03:19:45.521 --> 03:19:49.463]  I mean, it looks like things are deteriorating even faster.
[03:19:49.483 --> 03:19:51.344]  That's right.
[03:19:51.464 --> 03:19:52.764]  There's no recovery.
[03:19:53.645 --> 03:19:57.647]  The jobs growth continues to lag the population growth.
[03:19:58.980 --> 03:20:12.135]  The numbers are not exactly rigged, but what happens is the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses all of these models that don't really work except in normal times.
[03:20:13.096 --> 03:20:15.019]  So when they make these projections,
[03:20:16.087 --> 03:20:23.655]  And they're all loaded for times that are normal when the economy is growing and jobs are growing.
[03:20:24.416 --> 03:20:26.177]  And so there's no recovery.
[03:20:26.197 --> 03:20:27.259]  There's not going to be one.
[03:20:27.379 --> 03:20:33.805]  I suspect that during these next four years, we're going to see real problems with the dollar.
[03:20:34.646 --> 03:20:39.171]  We're going to see probably finally the inflation break loose.
[03:20:40.097 --> 03:20:43.439]  And they don't have any policies to deal with that.
[03:20:44.039 --> 03:20:55.425]  So the chances are whoever wins this election, that party is likely to be destroyed by the economic crisis that's sitting there waiting on the victor.
[03:20:58.726 --> 03:21:05.030]  Getting back to the election, they've been trying to hype civil unrest if the election's contested.
[03:21:05.950 --> 03:21:09.632]  Why do you think some of the establishment quarters have been pushing that?
[03:21:11.089 --> 03:21:19.113]  Well, I think that the Republicans intend to steal the election because they own the voting machines and they own the proprietary software.
[03:21:20.253 --> 03:21:23.415]  And I think that they intend to steal them.
[03:21:23.895 --> 03:21:26.556]  And it really depends on how close the election is.
[03:21:26.656 --> 03:21:28.857]  It's easy to steal a close election.
[03:21:28.917 --> 03:21:40.223]  It's hard to steal one that's not close because the exit polls, to the extent they still have them, are a check on the vote count.
[03:21:40.879 --> 03:21:48.321]  Well, you know, like if you have a vote count that varies considerably from the exit poll, it raises eyebrows.
[03:21:49.181 --> 03:21:55.782]  This is what happened in the 2004 election, where the exit polls show that Kerry had won.
[03:21:57.083 --> 03:22:00.944]  But the vote count, and this is a very unusual thing.
[03:22:01.424 --> 03:22:06.245]  So I think that they intend to steal it, but it may not be
[03:22:08.038 --> 03:22:20.503]  As close as they're counting on, in which case the machines won't be programmed to steal enough votes to throw the election to the Republicans.
[03:22:20.943 --> 03:22:27.806]  But I think that's what Karl Rove and the Republican machine intends.
[03:22:28.246 --> 03:22:29.487]  But it doesn't really matter.
[03:22:30.401 --> 03:22:34.984]  Because the policies are not going to be any different.
[03:22:35.024 --> 03:22:42.748]  As I said, all the two parties are fighting for is who gets to be the whore, the prostitute, for the interest groups.
[03:22:42.768 --> 03:22:44.569]  But what about my Obama phone?
[03:22:50.032 --> 03:22:57.576]  Look, I'm just, I think that whoever wins, it's a disaster for the country.
[03:22:58.849 --> 03:23:01.571]  And probably everybody should have voted for Ronald Reagan.
[03:23:02.071 --> 03:23:03.732]  He is a dead man.
[03:23:03.772 --> 03:23:07.795]  He'd be a better president than the two choices.
[03:23:07.815 --> 03:23:12.398]  Now, of course, you always have these third party candidates, and any of them would be far better.
[03:23:13.099 --> 03:23:17.501]  But the Americans are not yet ready to vote third party.
[03:23:18.502 --> 03:23:22.065]  So that's just my view.
[03:23:22.325 --> 03:23:24.046]  It's not anything that we can
[03:23:25.502 --> 03:23:34.712]  Uh, hope for the future because both parties have the same policies because they represent the same interest groups.
[03:23:35.233 --> 03:23:44.462]  You know, in the old system, when the unions were still strong, the Democrats had independent source of financing.
[03:23:45.483 --> 03:23:50.669]  And so there was some difference in the policies between the parties.
[03:23:51.550 --> 03:23:59.780]  But with the offshoring of all the manufacturing jobs, the decline in union
[03:24:00.712 --> 03:24:02.494]  Uh, members and power and money.
[03:24:02.534 --> 03:24:07.318]  The Democrats now dependent on the same campaign contributions.
[03:24:07.378 --> 03:24:10.600]  Sure, so it's really two different management teams.
[03:24:10.921 --> 03:24:14.624]  It's just two management teams fighting over who gets to be the whore.
[03:24:14.824 --> 03:24:15.945]  That's all it's about.
[03:24:16.185 --> 03:24:22.150]  It's not about policy or... So it's like two hookers in a parking lot fighting over a John.
[03:24:22.650 --> 03:24:25.132]  That's exactly what it is.
[03:24:26.233 --> 03:24:30.857]  And the American people are just so out of it, they haven't a clue.
[03:24:30.877 --> 03:24:33.079]  How does the music stop in all this, though?
[03:24:33.139 --> 03:24:40.826]  Because government's getting more insane, the police are getting more insane, the public's getting more insane, government's getting more insane.
[03:24:40.846 --> 03:24:43.248]  I mean, where does it end?
[03:24:43.288 --> 03:24:47.071]  Because, you know, we've talked a lot about this, how they used Al Qaeda against Libya, now Syria.
[03:24:48.032 --> 03:24:52.676]  And Hillary was in the news today saying, we've got to go into Syria because Al-Qaeda is there.
[03:24:53.496 --> 03:24:56.079]  So I mean, you know, I mean, it's just it's now.
[03:24:57.380 --> 03:25:00.842]  And I talk to people about this on the street and they go, well, yeah, we got to get Al-Qaeda.
[03:25:00.862 --> 03:25:04.685]  I'm like, the government put Al-Qaeda in there and they just go, but but it's Al-Qaeda.
[03:25:05.226 --> 03:25:06.947]  So, I mean, I mean, I guess it is.
[03:25:08.088 --> 03:25:12.692]  America was, I guess, by her prosperity was turned into the giant jellyfish.
[03:25:15.239 --> 03:25:16.420]  Well, that's right.
[03:25:16.680 --> 03:25:19.282]  I think where it ends is when the dollar goes.
[03:25:19.983 --> 03:25:22.105]  Because when the dollar goes, the power goes.
[03:25:23.426 --> 03:25:29.471]  We can't, you see, the only way we function now is because the dollar is the world reserve currency.
[03:25:29.511 --> 03:25:31.392]  We can pay our bills by printing money.
[03:25:32.113 --> 03:25:33.414]  No other country can do that.
[03:25:34.695 --> 03:25:38.398]  But when the dollar goes, you can't pay your bills and it's all over.
[03:25:39.298 --> 03:25:45.145]  And because the country is bankrupt and it survives because it can create money, it can print money.
[03:25:46.086 --> 03:25:51.032]  And the world will not accept it once it loses the reserve currency role.
[03:25:51.813 --> 03:25:56.139]  So I think that's when it ends or else it will end the nuclear war because
[03:25:57.329 --> 03:26:12.655]  We've been so aggressive toward Russia and China, and if you pay any attention to the news that comes out of Russia, you see they are upgrading all of their intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles.
[03:26:12.795 --> 03:26:20.797]  They're putting them to sea, upgrading their submarines, their seaborne platforms.
[03:26:21.598 --> 03:26:24.959]  We're forcing two other powers
[03:26:26.119 --> 03:26:32.422]  Uh, to become, uh, uh, to be, to respond to our aggressiveness toward them.
[03:26:32.742 --> 03:26:33.422]  But wait a minute.
[03:26:33.442 --> 03:26:42.166]  Uh, when Fukushima blew up and higher radiation clouds came over, they just had the EPA raise the level of what they said was safe.
[03:26:42.627 --> 03:26:46.689]  Couldn't they just put out a government policy report if all our cities got nuked?
[03:26:47.069 --> 03:26:49.450]  That nuclear weapons no longer destroy cities?
[03:26:49.810 --> 03:26:50.931]  If the air burst at 2,000 feet?
[03:26:52.751 --> 03:26:54.672]  Yeah, they'll probably do something like that.
[03:26:56.773 --> 03:26:59.754]  When one of those things goes off, the city will be destroyed.
[03:26:59.774 --> 03:27:02.555]  But not if government says.
[03:27:02.895 --> 03:27:08.377]  I'll never forget Perino, or whatever her name was, under Bush when they were devaluing the dollar in 2008.
[03:27:09.938 --> 03:27:10.178]  Well, D.C.
[03:27:10.198 --> 03:27:10.758]  wouldn't be there.
[03:27:34.042 --> 03:27:34.783]  I don't know.
[03:27:34.943 --> 03:27:36.824]  Karl Rove says they control reality.
[03:27:37.404 --> 03:27:45.269]  Yeah, well, if a nuke goes off in Washington, we'll be rid of the worst people in the country.
[03:27:46.570 --> 03:27:48.311]  Well, there's a conspiracy theory.
[03:27:48.371 --> 03:27:50.412]  He claims a nuke would destroy a city.
[03:27:50.592 --> 03:27:51.473]  That's his opinion.
[03:27:52.493 --> 03:27:55.135]  We all know where government comes from.
[03:27:55.215 --> 03:28:01.459]  It comes from our heavenly creator and the oxygen we breathe comes out of the tailpipe of politicians.
[03:28:02.841 --> 03:28:08.065]  Actually, actually, you know, all of this aggressiveness is the neoconservative ideology.
[03:28:08.966 --> 03:28:20.334]  You know, the project for the new American century that we, we are the indispensable people, we have the right to rule the others and to bend them to our will.
[03:28:20.994 --> 03:28:24.697]  And this is a very powerful and strong ideology.
[03:28:24.797 --> 03:28:29.120]  It's, it's completely represented in both parties.
[03:28:30.301 --> 03:28:32.445]  Particularly in the Republican Party now.
[03:28:33.447 --> 03:28:37.514]  And it leads to war.
[03:28:37.594 --> 03:28:40.319]  It presses other countries to respond.
[03:28:41.181 --> 03:28:42.702]  to the military aggression.
[03:28:42.742 --> 03:28:49.487]  You can't go build all kinds of missile bases around Russia and not expect a reaction.
[03:28:49.547 --> 03:28:59.513]  And you can't establish all kinds of new naval and air and land bases threatening China without expecting a reaction.
[03:28:59.593 --> 03:29:00.594]  And so what
[03:29:00.954 --> 03:29:02.775]  I mean, what is the policy, though?
[03:29:02.795 --> 03:29:14.141]  Because the globalists that run this country, you know, the corporations, this gaggle of special interests, they're busy offsourcing everything to China while trying to gear up for war with China.
[03:29:14.181 --> 03:29:16.923]  I mean, I guess they're just using them as a market
[03:29:17.483 --> 03:29:33.592]  Factor to destroy their economic enemies here while also wanting to destroy them I mean, I guess the the the new world order model the globalist model is overturn every every foundation every building every stone They attack the family they attack.
[03:29:34.092 --> 03:29:35.172]  They attack the Amish.
[03:29:35.212 --> 03:29:43.337]  They attack people selling lemonade I mean, I guess it is just basically a crazed gorilla on PCP running around beating everybody's brains up
[03:29:44.124 --> 03:29:45.946]  Well, they're different factions.
[03:29:46.326 --> 03:29:50.609]  You see, the corporations are not the New World Order.
[03:29:50.629 --> 03:29:57.355]  They're just increasing their profits and manager bonuses and shareholder returns.
[03:29:57.955 --> 03:30:03.880]  So the New World Order is kind of like a conductor with a bunch of pirates out of control swarming under its wings?
[03:30:05.629 --> 03:30:10.851]  Well, it may be trying to conduct them, but they're independent action.
[03:30:11.431 --> 03:30:18.674]  And the corporations in Wall Street are getting rich out of substituting cheap labor for expensive labor.
[03:30:19.737 --> 03:30:28.023]  And the wars are rewarding to the military security complex because they make billions and billions of profits.
[03:30:28.043 --> 03:30:34.187]  And the war on terror is rewarding to the police state aspects.
[03:30:34.247 --> 03:30:38.530]  We now have this Department of Homeland Security, which is creating its own army.
[03:30:39.470 --> 03:30:44.916]  And we have, you know, the CIA loves this because its power goes way up.
[03:30:45.016 --> 03:30:59.890]  So it is a lawlessness, a will to power that Nietzsche talked about, by all the special interests, where they're in control of everything but themselves, running around in 800 different directions just robbing and looting and stealing everything.
[03:31:00.632 --> 03:31:02.234]  That's about it, yes.
[03:31:02.694 --> 03:31:03.996]  You can see the lawlessness.
[03:31:04.196 --> 03:31:06.738]  I mean, look what Bush and Cheney did to the law.
[03:31:06.758 --> 03:31:12.244]  I mean, they destroyed the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, all of our legal protections.
[03:31:13.025 --> 03:31:15.187]  They violated U.S.
[03:31:15.227 --> 03:31:16.488]  statutory laws.
[03:31:17.329 --> 03:31:18.290]  Well, wait a minute, sir.
[03:31:18.350 --> 03:31:22.615]  FEMA says the founders were bad, so isn't it good to get rid of due process?
[03:31:24.598 --> 03:31:27.820]  Let's not start being silly.
[03:31:28.160 --> 03:31:30.841]  I know I'm being silly, but that's actually what they're saying.
[03:31:31.081 --> 03:31:38.924]  I think on the whole that the country has become lawless because that's what the government did.
[03:31:39.645 --> 03:31:43.947]  And when you have lawlessness, you end up with the power in the executive.
[03:31:44.787 --> 03:31:53.831]  And that's what the Republican society that wanted the unitary executive, the power in the executive.
[03:31:54.853 --> 03:31:57.135]  And so that's what we're getting.
[03:31:57.215 --> 03:32:01.939]  And the president is being transformed into Caesar.
[03:32:02.940 --> 03:32:04.461]  And he's not accountable.
[03:32:04.501 --> 03:32:05.642]  Look what Bush did.
[03:32:06.062 --> 03:32:08.504]  He violated U.S.
[03:32:08.604 --> 03:32:09.805]  law against torture.
[03:32:10.726 --> 03:32:17.652]  He violated the FISA Act against spying on Americans without warrants.
[03:32:18.621 --> 03:32:26.127]  He violated the due process requirement of the Constitution, habeas corpus.
[03:32:27.628 --> 03:32:29.850]  And he was not held accountable for any of this.
[03:32:29.970 --> 03:32:34.833]  And he went to war based on fabrications and lies.
[03:32:35.194 --> 03:32:36.435]  He knew he was lying.
[03:32:36.455 --> 03:32:39.097]  And this is a crime.
[03:32:39.677 --> 03:32:41.378]  And they've committed war crimes.
[03:32:42.319 --> 03:32:50.945]  And these are crimes under the Geneva Conventions, to which we are the main creator of.
[03:32:51.845 --> 03:32:53.826]  And there was no accountability.
[03:32:54.527 --> 03:32:56.989]  And so Obama comes in, and what did he do?
[03:32:57.029 --> 03:32:58.550]  He didn't hold them accountable either.
[03:32:58.590 --> 03:33:00.090]  He said, oh, I like all these powers.
[03:33:02.672 --> 03:33:03.852]  We'll make them legal.
[03:33:04.172 --> 03:33:07.273]  And Republicans identify with the Republicans and get a power trip.
[03:33:07.293 --> 03:33:09.554]  The Democrats identify with the Democrats and get a power trip.
[03:33:10.054 --> 03:33:14.415]  In summation, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, how does it end then?
[03:33:14.435 --> 03:33:20.476]  I mean, I guess nuclear war or the glorious rule of the neocons?
[03:33:21.917 --> 03:33:27.038]  Well, I don't think the United States will be able to prevail over Russia and China.
[03:33:28.448 --> 03:33:33.912]  If you look at, you know, we were 11 years in Afghanistan and apparently have been defeated.
[03:33:35.293 --> 03:33:38.995]  We were what, eight years in Iraq and achieved nothing.
[03:33:40.976 --> 03:33:51.083]  So if we can't occupy Baghdad, we can't defeat a few thousand Taliban armed with AK-47s, we're not going to be able to defeat Russia and China.
[03:33:52.165 --> 03:33:55.406]  They hold more cards.
[03:33:55.426 --> 03:34:02.809]  And so if we keep pressing, we're going to come up against these two powers.
[03:34:03.609 --> 03:34:05.310]  And they're certainly going to resist.
[03:34:06.594 --> 03:34:10.995]  And it's not going to go well for the United States or the world.
[03:34:11.975 --> 03:34:14.776]  And we also have the problem of the dollar.
[03:34:14.816 --> 03:34:26.959]  The Treasury continues to pour out over a trillion dollars in bonds every year, and the Federal Reserve continues to print the money to buy the bonds.
[03:34:28.181 --> 03:34:35.066]  And so the dollar cannot survive as the world reserve currency under that type of regime.
[03:34:35.347 --> 03:34:37.628]  And that was my next and final question.
[03:34:38.109 --> 03:34:41.651]  Max Keiser says he thinks the dollar's going to start dying by April.
[03:34:41.691 --> 03:34:43.092]  Lindsey Williams says this year.
[03:34:43.112 --> 03:34:48.296]  I remember you on the show like five years ago saying it'll take a lot longer than people say.
[03:34:49.017 --> 03:34:50.938]  The late, great Bob Chapman said the same thing.
[03:34:50.958 --> 03:34:51.479]  A lot of others.
[03:34:51.539 --> 03:34:55.322]  But here we are five years later and you said, you know, more like five, six years.
[03:34:56.162 --> 03:34:59.885]  I mean, now we are getting closer to that point, even if it's two, three years away.
[03:35:00.205 --> 03:35:02.587]  I mean, how long can this go?
[03:35:03.568 --> 03:35:06.290]  As they implode the economy, people keep racing into the dollar.
[03:35:06.730 --> 03:35:09.713]  It's still sinking, but not as fast as all the other currencies.
[03:35:09.753 --> 03:35:13.876]  I know that's an oversimplification, but I mean, is the comeuppance coming?
[03:35:14.557 --> 03:35:17.379]  And what are different ways it could fall apart?
[03:35:18.672 --> 03:35:22.895]  Well, it's hard to know, but I think it can't go on forever.
[03:35:23.456 --> 03:35:26.218]  I'd give it another two years, three at the most.
[03:35:27.318 --> 03:35:38.307]  And I think that you see right now, because of the euro crisis, which I think is largely hype, and we're behind it because it protects the dollar.
[03:35:40.388 --> 03:35:46.813]  But you see, the Chinese economy now is essentially the equal of our own.
[03:35:48.181 --> 03:35:49.982]  Uh, and in many ways superior.
[03:35:50.062 --> 03:36:00.284]  For example, uh, we've got, uh, like 12 million people working in manufacturing and China has 120 million.
[03:36:01.364 --> 03:36:07.386]  In other words, the manufacturing workforce of China is equal to the entire workforce of the United States.
[03:36:07.446 --> 03:36:08.766]  Manufacturing is power.
[03:36:11.347 --> 03:36:15.908]  So, and if you look at Russia, it's got all the energy it needs.
[03:36:16.248 --> 03:36:17.448]  It exports energy.
[03:36:18.403 --> 03:36:20.785]  And it really holds the cards over Europe.
[03:36:20.845 --> 03:36:29.150]  If it wanted to get tough and just say, OK, if you continue with NATO, you continue supporting the Americans, turn the gas off.
[03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:30.571]  We're going to turn it off.
[03:36:31.992 --> 03:36:45.420]  And so I just I don't I think the aggressiveness of the Americans does not serve our interests because it makes these other countries realize that they're threatened.
[03:36:46.397 --> 03:36:49.899]  And when they realize that, they take offsetting action.
[03:36:50.600 --> 03:36:58.945]  So I think that, as I said, I think the next four years is going to be extremely hard on whoever's in office.
[03:36:59.585 --> 03:37:03.487]  I wouldn't want to be there.
[03:37:03.507 --> 03:37:11.632]  And even if you had a really good man, a really good woman, a really good president in there, it's going to be extremely hard.
[03:37:11.692 --> 03:37:12.593]  Now for the two that
[03:37:13.442 --> 03:37:18.443]  That we're choosing between and neither of them is up to this type of challenge.
[03:37:19.224 --> 03:37:26.746]  And I think that Romney is up to even less because he's so cocksure and so aggressive.
[03:37:27.546 --> 03:37:33.147]  And I think that he'll have even a harder time than Obama would.
[03:37:33.968 --> 03:37:38.469]  But whoever is going to be in office for the next four years is going to be a failure.
[03:37:39.218 --> 03:37:39.378]  Sure.
[03:37:54.714 --> 03:37:57.776]  Well, let's talk about solutions, Dr. Roberts.
[03:37:57.816 --> 03:38:05.162]  You know, you charted the Reagan course, which undoubtedly was successful if people really study it, despite the Democrats demonizing it.
[03:38:06.002 --> 03:38:10.586]  You're a realist here, and I'm going to give you the floor in five closing minutes, and we're going to let you get to bed.
[03:38:10.606 --> 03:38:14.489]  I know it's late, or get back to watching the news, or our coverage, or whatever you're doing.
[03:38:14.869 --> 03:38:15.830]  What would you do?
[03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:25.816]  If you were president and you could somehow convince the House and Senate to go along with you, what would you do if you were, say, elected president for four years?
[03:38:26.697 --> 03:38:27.778]  Well, I'd stop the wars.
[03:38:28.839 --> 03:38:32.641]  Because that would save hundreds of billions of dollars instantly.
[03:38:34.262 --> 03:38:38.105]  And I would get it through.
[03:38:38.205 --> 03:38:43.569]  I would tax corporations according to where they added value to their product.
[03:38:44.386 --> 03:38:47.968]  If they add value in China, they'd have a very high tax rate.
[03:38:48.028 --> 03:38:50.909]  If they add value in the United States, they'd have a low tax rate.
[03:38:51.049 --> 03:38:56.851]  That would bring them back here, and we'd be able to get the jobs back and the careers back.
[03:38:56.871 --> 03:39:04.275]  We could recreate a middle class and recreate the ladders of upward mobility that gave us social stability.
[03:39:04.755 --> 03:39:07.216]  And that's what I would do, and nothing else would work.
[03:39:08.323 --> 03:39:12.668]  And actually, with all the powers the President has now, I wouldn't need the House and Senate.
[03:39:13.890 --> 03:39:16.653]  I could just say this is part of the wall of terror.
[03:39:17.093 --> 03:39:21.719]  And I don't have to give any accountability to the House and the Senate or to the courts.
[03:39:22.760 --> 03:39:26.665]  And if you give me too much trouble, I'll have to decide you're a terrorist and arrest you.
[03:39:28.515 --> 03:39:30.756]  But any president can do that now.
[03:39:31.217 --> 03:39:35.919]  I mean because of the way Bush and Cheney and Obama have developed this.
[03:39:36.559 --> 03:39:38.780]  The president really can do whatever he wants.
[03:39:38.880 --> 03:39:40.261]  He doesn't have to obey the law.
[03:39:40.321 --> 03:39:43.442]  He doesn't have to pay attention to separation of powers.
[03:39:43.482 --> 03:39:45.163]  He declares a war when he wants to.
[03:39:45.183 --> 03:39:51.506]  It's like, it's already evolving into a dictatorship.
[03:39:53.760 --> 03:39:59.205]  And expanding on that, Ron Paul said, look, if I got elected president, I'm not going to use these unconstitutional powers.
[03:39:59.745 --> 03:40:01.626]  So don't expect me to be able to fix things.
[03:40:01.687 --> 03:40:05.249]  And that's the old thing of Gandalf when they offer him the ring of power.
[03:40:05.269 --> 03:40:06.310]  He says, don't offer me that.
[03:40:06.330 --> 03:40:07.291]  It would be turned to bad.
[03:40:07.311 --> 03:40:10.734]  I mean, obviously, if you were president, you wouldn't use the dictatorial powers.
[03:40:11.314 --> 03:40:13.876]  The problem is the bureaucracy itself behaves.
[03:40:14.657 --> 03:40:16.138]  In a dictatorial way right now.
[03:40:16.158 --> 03:40:19.701]  I mean, we see this with sheriff's deputies and bureaucrats and code enforcers.
[03:40:19.761 --> 03:40:23.925]  And, you know, we see census takers busting down doors and raping women.
[03:40:24.525 --> 03:40:31.932]  I mean, that's what's so scary about a tyranny is it empowers all these other little scumlings to do whatever they want.
[03:40:31.992 --> 03:40:37.677]  And here's what's different between America and Germany or Russia or Cambodia or any of these tyrannies.
[03:40:39.355 --> 03:40:41.937]  There are 170 million gun owners, roughly.
[03:40:42.037 --> 03:40:46.221]  There are 400 million guns of newer manufacturers in the last 50 years.
[03:40:46.961 --> 03:40:51.285]  If just 1% of those people stand up, you're talking about 1,700,000 people.
[03:40:51.745 --> 03:41:03.155]  And I'm here to tell you, a lot of people are not looking for trouble, but if stuff really unravels, they're not going to FEMA camps, they're not going to work centers, they're just going to die at their house or they're going to go out and find some trouble.
[03:41:03.755 --> 03:41:05.838]  I don't think the bureaucrats understand.
[03:41:05.878 --> 03:41:07.640]  Their real threat's not going to be Russia and China.
[03:41:08.161 --> 03:41:20.256]  If they really push this over the edge with all these desperate people, I think they're taking the restraint of constitutionalists and veterans and people as weakness when I think it's really the opposite.
[03:41:21.077 --> 03:41:28.542]  The average person out there who is really informed, understands the average cop or military security person is just a minion and isn't their enemy.
[03:41:28.603 --> 03:41:29.243]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:41:29.803 --> 03:41:35.808]  If that minion of the system marches out against you, well then it's a whole other ball of wax.
[03:41:35.848 --> 03:41:40.311]  And I'm looking at civil war in this country, Dr. Roberts, if this continues.
[03:41:41.572 --> 03:41:43.273]  Well, I don't know about that, Alex.
[03:41:43.393 --> 03:41:46.995]  I think the people are a long ways from that.
[03:41:47.356 --> 03:41:48.897]  They'll have to be hungry first.
[03:41:49.947 --> 03:41:53.129]  Oppressed in ways that they realize.
[03:41:54.090 --> 03:42:01.935]  And I think where the trouble will come will be they're going to run into trouble with Iran, with Russia, with China, and with the dollar.
[03:42:02.655 --> 03:42:06.677]  And I think that's going to overwhelm their power and their confidence.
[03:42:07.798 --> 03:42:12.041]  And I think that's how this comes to an end.
[03:42:12.121 --> 03:42:17.784]  I don't think it will be from gun owners or civil war, but I don't really know.
[03:42:18.004 --> 03:42:18.645]  You may be right.
[03:42:22.256 --> 03:42:26.217]  All right, well, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thank you so much for the time tonight.
[03:42:26.237 --> 03:42:28.137]  We'll have to continue to check in with you.
[03:42:28.177 --> 03:42:30.558]  The website is paulcraigroberts.org.
[03:42:30.678 --> 03:42:32.038]  Excellent site, excellent articles.
[03:42:32.918 --> 03:42:34.939]  And again, you have the Joseph Stalin quote up there today.
[03:42:34.979 --> 03:42:37.419]  He who casts the vote decides nothing.
[03:42:37.479 --> 03:42:39.960]  He who counts the vote decides everything.
[03:42:40.020 --> 03:42:48.982]  So I guess there is a democracy within the republic in that the different crime syndicates are trying to steal as many votes as they can.
[03:42:49.022 --> 03:42:49.782]  So there is a type of
[03:42:50.982 --> 03:42:51.342]  Right.
[03:42:51.422 --> 03:42:53.123]  Criminal fraud, free market there.
[03:42:53.964 --> 03:42:54.104]  Right.
[03:42:54.344 --> 03:42:54.804]  That's it.
[03:42:55.385 --> 03:42:55.945]  Thank you, Doctor.
[03:42:55.965 --> 03:42:58.287]  Glad to be with you, Alex.
[03:42:58.587 --> 03:42:59.047]  Thank you, sir.
[03:42:59.067 --> 03:42:59.868]  Have a good night as well.
[03:43:00.268 --> 03:43:02.990]  We'll continue to track this right past midnight tonight.
[03:43:03.070 --> 03:43:05.891]  Jakari Jackson will be in next with reports.
[03:43:05.911 --> 03:43:09.614]  Let's get a final update from our own David Knight, then I'm going to take
[03:43:10.194 --> 03:43:13.336]  A raft of phone calls before going back to Jakari Jackson.
[03:43:13.356 --> 03:43:14.877]  I've got my list here.
[03:43:15.037 --> 03:43:18.060]  Yeah, we're going to get a final report from David Knight.
[03:43:18.080 --> 03:43:21.702]  He's done a great job tonight tracking all this with the rest of our election research crew.
[03:43:22.863 --> 03:43:24.124]  These are extremists, by the way.
[03:43:24.144 --> 03:43:27.186]  We actually read government documents that are informed and don't have teleprompters.
[03:43:27.546 --> 03:43:29.207]  We can just talk for hours and hours without them.
[03:43:29.607 --> 03:43:30.328]  We're bad people.
[03:43:30.808 --> 03:43:32.950]  We don't like world government either, or unelected government.
[03:43:33.410 --> 03:43:35.531]  And then we're going to have Jakari Jackson giving us reports.
[03:43:35.571 --> 03:43:36.952]  I promise we're going to go to
[03:43:38.455 --> 03:43:41.278]  I'm going to get it right the 10th time.
[03:43:41.318 --> 03:43:44.681]  How do you say it?
[03:43:45.081 --> 03:43:49.625]  Paul, Kim, Cody, Josh, John, and others before we go to Jakari.
[03:43:49.645 --> 03:43:52.647]  But first, let's get an update from our own David Knight.
[03:43:52.667 --> 03:43:53.948]  I know we've got reporters out on the street.
[03:43:54.289 --> 03:43:56.510]  They're filing reports to InfoWars.com as well.
[03:43:56.831 --> 03:43:59.173]  David, a final report from you tonight, sir.
[03:44:00.236 --> 03:44:02.017]  Well, Alex, it's still pretty much tied up.
[03:44:02.698 --> 03:44:04.299]  It looks like it's dead even.
[03:44:04.319 --> 03:44:06.920]  As a matter of fact, in Florida, at 85% of the vote in, it was 49.7 for Obama, 49.4 for Romney.
[03:44:06.940 --> 03:44:10.182]  At one point, when it was back in the 60% in, they were only separated by about 115 votes.
[03:44:18.439 --> 03:44:25.466]  So, in my take, I think the real story here is the voting machines and the integrity of the political process.
[03:44:26.087 --> 03:44:31.773]  When I look at these voting machines, I look at this article that Steve Watson wrote earlier today about all the problems that were happening.
[03:44:32.974 --> 03:44:35.837]  It looks to me like the voting machines are a perfect metaphor for government.
[03:44:35.877 --> 03:44:37.459]  You know, they're expensive.
[03:44:38.260 --> 03:44:39.942]  They give you the opposite of what you choose.
[03:44:40.602 --> 03:44:42.885]  They generally don't work and they're easily corrupted.
[03:44:43.646 --> 03:44:50.294]  We've got reports from Iowa that says that, you know, machines failed to operate there for 45 minutes in North Carolina.
[03:44:50.775 --> 03:44:53.238]  They had vote flipping in Greensboro and Charlotte.
[03:44:53.838 --> 03:44:58.101]  In Missouri, they had voters also claiming machines were flipping their votes.
[03:44:58.341 --> 03:45:04.745]  In Northern Virginia, they had a lot of, they had hundreds of voters turned away because so many machines were failing to operate.
[03:45:05.146 --> 03:45:12.731]  Yeah, we've confirmed, just to interject, here in Austin, they've had high schools and grocery stores that have voting just where it's not working, period.
[03:45:13.711 --> 03:45:13.891]  Right.
[03:45:14.152 --> 03:45:15.532]  And that's what happened in Northern Virginia.
[03:45:15.572 --> 03:45:20.375]  The machines didn't work and they only had 50 paper ballots to give people and they were turning hundreds of people away.
[03:45:21.196 --> 03:45:22.797]  Same thing in Spartanburg.
[03:45:22.937 --> 03:45:26.819]  They twice ran out of paper ballots in South Carolina.
[03:45:27.440 --> 03:45:33.684]  And then all these other places where they've just got general failing, where the machines had to be reset, they didn't work for hours.
[03:45:33.724 --> 03:45:40.488]  That's in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Georgia.
[03:45:41.108 --> 03:45:41.629]  Virginia?
[03:45:41.649 --> 03:45:42.390]  Arkansas?
[03:45:42.410 --> 03:45:44.273]  I mean, it's a real problem.
[03:45:44.693 --> 03:45:52.684]  Hopefully, people will wake up and understand that, you know, we don't need these expensive, non-functioning machines that are so easily tricked.
[03:45:52.784 --> 03:45:55.768]  You know, I think that's a big part of this story here.
[03:45:56.431 --> 03:46:14.128]  Well, they've been proven to be frauds over and over again, and how dare you say we shouldn't have these foreign-owned voting machines that they say are proprietary and have been proven to be frauds, and their own codes have been released at Diabol that it's designed for fraud, and their own engineers have gone public saying it's a fraud, and people have been convicted of fraud.
[03:46:14.648 --> 03:46:17.991]  I mean, that's extreme, David, that you're saying we shouldn't just completely trust these.
[03:46:18.700 --> 03:46:35.137]  That's right, and you can go on the internet and just look on YouTube and look at all the examples that people have gone in and hacked machines and they show you how easy it is to hack it, how you can, you know, essentially transfer it, you know, from one machine to the other and how these viruses will essentially erase themselves so there's no trace.
[03:46:35.157 --> 03:46:38.901]  They'll even print out the tests correctly and then start flipping votes.
[03:46:39.946 --> 03:46:46.831]  Yeah, perfectly designed for fraud on record, and they've been caught, but the government wouldn't do that, and corporations wouldn't do that.
[03:46:46.851 --> 03:46:49.633]  I mean, there's not powerful people, David, that want power.
[03:46:49.653 --> 03:46:59.360]  I mean, I think we should turn our guns in and go live in giant Agenda 21 plastic cities where a computer tells us what food and water we get, like the zeitgeist people call for.
[03:46:59.380 --> 03:47:01.601]  Well, that's the vision they have for us.
[03:47:01.661 --> 03:47:02.362]  But, you know, I think
[03:47:03.228 --> 03:47:11.175]  We had some polls that we put on Infowars.com, and one of them was asking people what they thought was the most effective way to effect change.
[03:47:11.896 --> 03:47:17.660]  And interestingly enough, for the people who go to Infowars, 51% picked educating other people.
[03:47:18.101 --> 03:47:27.209]  There was only, if you look at, we had several options that would have revolved around the electoral process, like running for office, helping with a campaign, even putting ballot initiatives on.
[03:47:27.669 --> 03:47:29.691]  Altogether, those were getting about 15% of the vote.
[03:47:31.812 --> 03:47:35.774]  State nullification was second by itself and it got about 12% of the vote.
[03:47:36.154 --> 03:47:40.415]  I guess the one thing I was surprised and disappointed in was that jury nullification was only down at about 3%.
[03:47:40.475 --> 03:47:40.675]  Wow.
[03:47:40.955 --> 03:47:50.979]  And I think as we look at, you know, that's a very important thing that not much has been talked about because that's a very important device that's basically just kind of fallen by the wayside for citizens.
[03:47:51.279 --> 03:47:55.841]  When you look at how corrupt the electoral process is, and you look at how easily that has changed,
[03:47:56.801 --> 03:48:02.582]  And a jury, it only takes one educated person to shut down these laws and keep somebody from going to jail unjustly.
[03:48:02.602 --> 03:48:03.142]  You know what?
[03:48:03.182 --> 03:48:04.323]  That's a great idea.
[03:48:04.783 --> 03:48:06.283]  Because I talked about this earlier tonight.
[03:48:06.583 --> 03:48:08.843]  You should do a report, David, here for InfoWars.
[03:48:08.863 --> 03:48:18.805]  You do such great reports on all the different ways we can vote, juries, grand juries, voting with our dollars, voting with our speech, outside of the system they've taken over.
[03:48:19.065 --> 03:48:21.026]  Because you notice they're doing everything they can to shut down
[03:48:21.886 --> 03:48:22.547]  Take Prop 37.
[03:48:23.227 --> 03:48:25.429]  How dare you be able to know what's in your food?
[03:48:25.449 --> 03:48:26.730]  Let's put a blindfold on you.
[03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:32.794]  I think that's a very important report to do of what we can do outside of this fraudulent system.
[03:48:33.075 --> 03:48:35.677]  I know you've been working about 13 hours today so far.
[03:48:35.697 --> 03:48:46.405]  We've got Jakari Jackson coming up with more reports in the chair you're in, but I look forward to having both of you tomorrow with whatever information you collate popping in on the daytime radio show, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[03:48:47.025 --> 03:48:48.647]  Thank you so much for your work today, David.
[03:48:49.147 --> 03:48:49.367]  Great.
[03:48:49.407 --> 03:48:49.968]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:48:50.208 --> 03:48:51.329]  All right, there goes David Knight.
[03:48:51.409 --> 03:48:52.931]  I'm telling you, I am really liking this.
[03:48:53.171 --> 03:48:55.033]  I'm in this studio and they're in that studio.
[03:48:55.413 --> 03:48:56.254]  This is really cool.
[03:48:56.694 --> 03:49:00.518]  And at Beta Test tonight, folks, we have done this whole thing.
[03:49:00.538 --> 03:49:05.223]  It would have gone off with a hitch if we would have had a few issues right at the start.
[03:49:05.283 --> 03:49:08.586]  But again, very, very, very, very excited about what's happening.
[03:49:08.606 --> 03:49:10.067]  Aaron Dykes will be popping in as well.
[03:49:10.448 --> 03:49:12.129]  Let's get to some of your phone calls.
[03:49:12.910 --> 03:49:23.596]  And then we're going to get an update on the news coming up in about 15-20 minutes from Jakari Jackson before we get Lou Rockwell on.
[03:49:23.656 --> 03:49:24.857]  Because, see, we're already getting behind.
[03:49:24.897 --> 03:49:30.040]  Perhaps we're going to get Jakari on then during that break after Lou Rockwell.
[03:49:30.080 --> 03:49:31.601]  I guess that's what's going to happen right there.
[03:49:31.621 --> 03:49:33.862]  So we'll move that up to about...
[03:49:36.192 --> 03:49:42.400]  Get Rockwell on at about 9.30 Central, and then when he leaves us, right at 10, get Shaqari in for his first update.
[03:49:42.821 --> 03:49:44.783]  And I'm gonna say this, because I won't be...
[03:49:46.886 --> 03:49:49.207]  Operable tomorrow if I don't leave here about midnight.
[03:49:49.788 --> 03:49:59.092]  I do want to be here for dr. Tarpley At 1130 central and I want to continue I mean I like to stay up all night and call the election Problem is it'll probably still be going tomorrow.
[03:49:59.132 --> 03:50:16.281]  So I have to be here for the radio and have some sleep But I do want to just tell the crew That if you guys want to have a big roundtable in here or wherever We're welcome to that After midnight if we want to take calls and stuff because we should just be here just taking call after call after call
[03:50:17.796 --> 03:50:22.380]  Okay, I've said this like eight different ways in the hour the person's been holding and we're going to go to them now.
[03:50:23.602 --> 03:50:25.423]  Itamio in California.
[03:50:25.644 --> 03:50:26.565]  Did I get that right?
[03:50:27.946 --> 03:50:28.587]  Itamio.
[03:50:28.787 --> 03:50:29.007]  Close.
[03:50:29.487 --> 03:50:31.750]  I have a small brain, but great name, sir.
[03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:32.390]  I apologize.
[03:50:32.430 --> 03:50:32.751]  Go ahead.
[03:50:33.551 --> 03:50:35.053]  Oh, thank you very much.
[03:50:35.333 --> 03:50:40.198]  Well, I just wanted to make a comment on the geopolitical sphere we have right now.
[03:50:41.201 --> 03:50:45.564]  I think that this whole situation is just, it's ridiculous.
[03:50:45.664 --> 03:50:48.525]  And I have to agree with Max Keiser when he said, why would I vote?
[03:50:48.585 --> 03:50:50.746]  It's just a dog and pony show.
[03:50:51.287 --> 03:50:56.429]  I think voting at the local level and at the state levels are far more important.
[03:50:57.070 --> 03:51:03.954]  And I myself have to say that at the federal level, it's just all a shell game.
[03:51:04.254 --> 03:51:08.256]  I mean, if you vote in Hitler, you still get Hitler.
[03:51:08.849 --> 03:51:10.949]  It's really not making much of a difference.
[03:51:10.989 --> 03:51:11.910]  Well, at least I voted.
[03:51:11.970 --> 03:51:13.750]  Well, you still have a murderous dictator.
[03:51:13.930 --> 03:51:14.610]  Exactly.
[03:51:14.810 --> 03:51:17.250]  And every president gets worse.
[03:51:17.290 --> 03:51:19.571]  And I'm always thinking it's this person that's bad.
[03:51:19.591 --> 03:51:22.851]  It's that the system is getting away with more and more.
[03:51:23.331 --> 03:51:26.772]  And so I see Obama just getting away with stuff.
[03:51:26.792 --> 03:51:34.973]  I mean, you know, we've had Christopher Hedges on, who is a Pulitzer Prize winning super liberal, but a real liberal.
[03:51:35.354 --> 03:51:37.494]  And he says Obama is twice as bad as Bush.
[03:51:38.607 --> 03:51:41.568]  And, you know, Bush was worse than Clinton in many ways.
[03:51:42.289 --> 03:51:44.449]  And now Obama is worse.
[03:51:44.609 --> 03:51:49.531]  And I mean, it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[03:51:49.731 --> 03:51:53.453]  And we're meant to think it's just presidents because they can come and go.
[03:51:54.193 --> 03:51:55.774]  Meanwhile, the power structure
[03:51:57.301 --> 03:52:05.806]  Continues to move forward and so the question is how do we get around that because even though I'm aware I'm the guy that came up with the term left-right paradigm.
[03:52:05.906 --> 03:52:06.787]  I know all this.
[03:52:07.327 --> 03:52:10.269]  I'm still desperate I'm like hoping for some change.
[03:52:10.429 --> 03:52:23.877]  I'm I'm wishing things would get better I didn't endorse Obama, but I said I hope he keeps some of his promises some of them are good you know some of his platform is good like ending torture ending wars and Now it's just we've gotten to the point of
[03:52:24.917 --> 03:52:27.738]  We know it's only going to get worse, so what do we do?
[03:52:29.118 --> 03:52:32.840]  Well, in my opinion, I mean, the entire system has to change.
[03:52:33.120 --> 03:52:38.261]  I mean, you can have someone like Ron Paul who can come in for eight years, and I mean, it'll be terrific.
[03:52:38.341 --> 03:52:49.225]  He may completely reform the way our government works, but then the next election you can have some Satanist who comes in and completely destroys everything within two years by getting us into a nuclear war.
[03:52:49.941 --> 03:52:54.742]  So, I think the system itself and the people need to change.
[03:52:54.842 --> 03:53:04.985]  I myself have outlined a change in government system where there wouldn't be any elections, but at the upper level of government, it will be professional.
[03:53:05.245 --> 03:53:08.325]  You know, where are our astrophysicists?
[03:53:08.385 --> 03:53:10.486]  Where are our marine biologists?
[03:53:10.626 --> 03:53:12.426]  Our computer programmers?
[03:53:12.747 --> 03:53:14.527]  Our mechanical engineers?
[03:53:15.368 --> 03:53:23.455]  Nobody was perfect in any country, but 200 years ago, whether it was Japan or Europe or Mexico, the rock stars were scientists and inventors.
[03:53:23.515 --> 03:53:34.385]  People knew, hey, a guy that figures out a better engine or a lady that figures out a better plant or George Washington Carver that figures out a better way to grow crops, they're going to make our life better.
[03:53:34.465 --> 03:53:35.486]  That's the rock star.
[03:53:36.107 --> 03:53:37.848]  And now they've made our rock stars
[03:53:38.729 --> 03:53:45.472]  You know, fake James Bond and all this other garbage, and it's a total distraction.
[03:53:46.472 --> 03:53:49.893]  And that's why it freaks me out when people call up here saying, oh Alex, you're great.
[03:53:50.214 --> 03:53:51.074]  Hey, I'm not great.
[03:53:51.494 --> 03:53:54.395]  Humanity's great, and God empowering us is great.
[03:53:56.036 --> 03:53:57.537]  Wow, did Romney just surge ahead?
[03:53:57.597 --> 03:53:58.257]  Is that new numbers?
[03:53:58.897 --> 03:54:00.058]  I just see some new numbers there.
[03:54:00.078 --> 03:54:01.019]  I tell you, this is killing me.
[03:54:01.360 --> 03:54:03.682]  Have you ever seen an election where it's back and forth like this?
[03:54:04.062 --> 03:54:06.185]  They are really rigging this to make us think it's real.
[03:54:06.525 --> 03:54:08.287]  God bless you, sir, from California.
[03:54:08.307 --> 03:54:09.048]  I appreciate your call.
[03:54:09.368 --> 03:54:16.335]  Paul in Maryland, you're on the air ahead of our next guest that is coming on the broadcast.
[03:54:16.355 --> 03:54:17.256]  It'll be Lou Rockwell.
[03:54:17.817 --> 03:54:18.738]  Go ahead, Paul.
[03:54:20.027 --> 03:54:24.308]  I wanted to say first off, God bless you.
[03:54:24.508 --> 03:54:30.790]  I've been listening to you since like 09 for real.
[03:54:32.991 --> 03:54:35.071]  I think you talk about like a lot of good things.
[03:54:35.752 --> 03:54:47.175]  But one thing you said like mentioned is, you know, these people that's elite, they're really under the covers like, you know, and spirit wise, they're
[03:54:47.972 --> 03:54:56.414]  They're the fallen angels and their offspring, you know, the Nephilim or Anunnaki or whatever other name they're... I'll say this, they aren't like us, buddy.
[03:54:56.454 --> 03:54:57.554]  They aren't like us.
[03:54:57.854 --> 03:54:58.415]  No, no, I hear you.
[03:54:58.435 --> 03:54:59.155]  They're not like us.
[03:54:59.235 --> 03:54:59.875]  Let me tell you something.
[03:55:00.255 --> 03:55:04.376]  I would die right now before I do something to an innocent child.
[03:55:05.096 --> 03:55:07.337]  A normal person wants to protect little children.
[03:55:07.517 --> 03:55:08.757]  These globalists love to hurt them.
[03:55:09.197 --> 03:55:11.018]  And so, yes, they're not like us.
[03:55:11.298 --> 03:55:13.018]  You can call them whatever you want to call them.
[03:55:13.458 --> 03:55:16.079]  They're not batting for Team Humanity as
[03:55:18.160 --> 03:55:19.722]  Exactly.
[03:55:19.742 --> 03:55:26.029]  Yeah, I've seen a lot of your movies too, like, you know, was that Obama Deception?
[03:55:26.049 --> 03:55:32.557]  That's the one that really like, you know, intrigued me the most because that's when I first woke up and I was like, oh, seven.
[03:55:33.097 --> 03:55:34.879]  But before that, like, right.
[03:55:35.440 --> 03:55:36.661]  Because I was in the army in 07 and.
[03:55:38.729 --> 03:55:40.090]  You know, I only stayed in 10 months.
[03:55:40.130 --> 03:55:46.072]  I got an honorable discharge, but I didn't want to stay in because they were trying to send me to Iraq, and I wasn't mentally stable.
[03:55:46.152 --> 03:55:53.475]  I was, you know, a young kid at that time, but, you know, I went in thinking that I was going to be able to go to school because the recruiter, you know, they tricked
[03:55:53.795 --> 03:55:55.056]  These kids.
[03:55:55.276 --> 03:55:55.776]  No, I know.
[03:55:56.136 --> 03:56:03.200]  When I was 18, I was somewhat responsible compared to most of them, but I was still, I look back, I was a crazy animal at 18.
[03:56:03.600 --> 03:56:09.343]  And I could not imagine someone throwing a gun in my hands in training and saying, go out and kill people when I was 18.
[03:56:09.423 --> 03:56:17.528]  I mean, I mean, I cannot, I'm surprised we don't have more disasters with what's going on with the young people and this modern warfare.
[03:56:18.428 --> 03:56:18.968]  Exactly.
[03:56:20.819 --> 03:56:34.110]  You know, so, but that movie definitely woke me up and ever since then I've been on it and I've just been exposing them on my Facebook or, you know, other means just by talking about it.
[03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:37.893]  Listen, Paul, you're doing a great job, but let me ask you this real fast in the interest of time.
[03:56:38.673 --> 03:56:41.376]  Each puppet gives me a shiver up my spine.
[03:56:41.516 --> 03:56:43.778]  Romney, Obama, in your gut,
[03:56:44.648 --> 03:56:47.872]  Which one, obviously they're puppets, but it doesn't matter.
[03:56:48.172 --> 03:56:54.079]  It's like, you know, it's kind of the figurehead on a ship, or like on the Viking ship, you know, it still means something, like which team it is.
[03:56:54.500 --> 03:56:57.043]  In your gut, which group is scarier?
[03:56:58.502 --> 03:57:00.423]  I think the Democrats.
[03:57:00.563 --> 03:57:12.206]  I mean, Republicans, they show a lot, but Democrats being on their, you know, silent tip, even a little bit more, I think they're hiding a little bit more, you know, basically.
[03:57:12.866 --> 03:57:23.509]  And I think Obama, actually, in my opinion, if something ends up happening to him, you know, whether it be, you know, I don't know, something that happens to his head or whatever,
[03:57:24.784 --> 03:57:28.167]  Then that's just going to prove, because I believe in God and I have faith in the Lord.
[03:57:28.267 --> 03:57:31.449]  Oh yeah, you're talking about the anti-crush, yeah.
[03:57:31.509 --> 03:57:34.532]  I mean, you look at all the stuff in Syria and the threats on Russia.
[03:57:34.972 --> 03:57:36.373]  I tell you, the whole thing's scary.
[03:57:36.453 --> 03:57:37.134]  I know, I know.
[03:57:37.154 --> 03:57:41.978]  You know, that's the thing, I'm always telling my wife, oh no, I believe in Revelation, but it's coming down the road.
[03:57:41.998 --> 03:57:45.561]  You hear about school kids getting RFIDs around their necks nationwide.
[03:57:46.081 --> 03:57:48.463]  It's kind of like, man, when is this going to end?
[03:57:48.843 --> 03:57:50.044]  When is it going to get better?
[03:57:50.365 --> 03:57:53.907]  Why does it just get crazier and crazier and crazier?
[03:57:55.169 --> 03:57:59.332]  By the moment, it makes my head spin.
[03:57:59.392 --> 03:58:00.433]  Great, great points, Paul.
[03:58:00.453 --> 03:58:02.014]  Kim in California, you're on the air.
[03:58:02.054 --> 03:58:02.375]  Welcome.
[03:58:03.676 --> 03:58:04.016]  Hello?
[03:58:04.396 --> 03:58:04.596]  Hi.
[03:58:05.657 --> 03:58:05.918]  Hi.
[03:58:07.619 --> 03:58:09.761]  I got all nervous all of a sudden.
[03:58:10.221 --> 03:58:11.582]  I think the whole thing is rigged.
[03:58:11.622 --> 03:58:21.631]  I think they're trying to do a neck-and-neck kind of deal so then when they do the ballots that they're going to extend so they can just put Obama back in.
[03:58:22.728 --> 03:58:23.428]  No, I hear you.
[03:58:23.448 --> 03:58:38.374]  Look, I've really, for 17 years, studied election fraud, interviewed all the experts, and in the old days, like 15 years ago or 20 years ago, you could have the media announce the winner and then just ignore what the real results were later.
[03:58:38.794 --> 03:58:46.416]  Now, because people are watching for fraud, the fraud is in different regions, but Democrats control certain areas, Republicans control others.
[03:58:46.436 --> 03:58:47.717]  It's kind of like Lance Armstrong.
[03:58:49.085 --> 03:58:52.228]  And his teammates, you know, said in private meetings, he said, look, we got to cheat.
[03:58:52.268 --> 03:58:53.289]  Everybody else is cheating.
[03:58:53.589 --> 03:58:54.730]  Well, the Democrats are cheating.
[03:58:54.750 --> 03:58:55.891]  So the Republicans got to cheat.
[03:58:56.151 --> 03:58:57.272]  Well, the Republicans are cheating.
[03:58:57.292 --> 03:58:58.393]  So the Democrats got to cheat.
[03:58:58.733 --> 03:59:00.415]  And that's how corruption works.
[03:59:00.455 --> 03:59:01.796]  Everybody just goes ahead and does it.
[03:59:02.296 --> 03:59:03.277]  But looking at this.
[03:59:04.378 --> 03:59:11.382]  I don't even know if the establishment now knows who's going to win, because the fraud is all broken up.
[03:59:12.303 --> 03:59:14.704]  And some areas have real voting, some areas don't.
[03:59:15.265 --> 03:59:22.949]  It's a big job to engage in fraud like this, because there's over a dozen major companies with a voting machine, so it's kind of a cobbled together deal.
[03:59:23.790 --> 03:59:27.392]  That's why instead they just go make sure they own both candidates.
[03:59:27.452 --> 03:59:30.334]  But you think they're getting ready to put Obama back in?
[03:59:33.086 --> 03:59:34.527]  That's what you think, Kim?
[03:59:37.209 --> 03:59:38.390]  I think she made her point and hung up.
[03:59:38.490 --> 03:59:39.391]  Okay, thank you, Kim.
[03:59:39.811 --> 03:59:40.612]  We'll see if you're right.
[03:59:41.152 --> 03:59:42.953]  I don't even think it matters at this point.
[03:59:43.874 --> 03:59:56.303]  Again, as just a primitive person at a non-intellectual level, even though I know Obama's a puppet, I still think, get rid of him and that'll make him change management teams and it'll take Romney a few months to get organized.
[03:59:56.323 --> 03:59:57.164]  That'll buy us some time.
[03:59:57.584 --> 04:00:02.308]  But then the other side of my mind says, but that'll make everybody go back to sleep because there's a new puppet.
[04:00:02.768 --> 04:00:04.429]  It's like Obama did for a couple years.
[04:00:04.489 --> 04:00:06.210]  Maybe we keep Obama in it gets worse.
[04:00:06.690 --> 04:00:08.151]  Look, God's in control.
[04:00:09.112 --> 04:00:13.555]  We just do the right thing, expose these people, and move forward.
[04:00:13.695 --> 04:00:16.156]  My make it or break it issue is this.
[04:00:17.597 --> 04:00:20.559]  Obama is funding abortion worldwide.
[04:00:22.729 --> 04:00:33.156]  And they're doing it in countries where people don't have food to eat, they've had their food cut off, and they're telling them, get an abortion, get sterilized, we'll give you $2,000.
[04:00:33.196 --> 04:00:36.158]  They do that all over Africa.
[04:00:37.159 --> 04:00:40.161]  And it's not that I'm in some bleeding heart thing for Africa.
[04:00:40.482 --> 04:00:44.545]  Look, I don't want to know my heart and my soul that they're killing babies in Africa.
[04:00:45.325 --> 04:00:47.747]  Okay, I mean, it just comes down to that.
[04:00:48.127 --> 04:00:51.490]  My soul cannot sign on to that.
[04:00:51.870 --> 04:00:58.515]  And that's why it's so irritating to hear all day how I'm a racist because I don't like Obama, when Obama is expanding all of this.
[04:00:58.735 --> 04:01:01.417]  It's very... Frauds make me mad.
[04:01:01.457 --> 04:01:09.343]  Just open oxymoron, total scams, where the reality is 180 degrees.
[04:01:09.383 --> 04:01:10.424]  That makes me very upset.
[04:01:10.884 --> 04:01:14.387]  But the truth is, when Republicans get into office, they don't get rid of abortion either.
[04:01:15.327 --> 04:01:17.649]  And then they sell it to women like it's some wonderful right.
[04:01:17.669 --> 04:01:21.351]  Look, I'm not judging some woman out there if she was 16 years old and got an abortion.
[04:01:21.971 --> 04:01:25.334]  All I'm saying is stop using abortion for contraception.
[04:01:26.094 --> 04:01:28.156]  Stop saying it isn't a baby, okay?
[04:01:28.196 --> 04:01:30.417]  If you're gonna do it, be honest about it.
[04:01:30.917 --> 04:01:38.082]  For heaven's sakes, don't wait till the third trimester when the baby's 7 pounds and chop it up.
[04:01:38.282 --> 04:01:41.645]  I hear women email me and I get calls, don't talk about chopping it up.
[04:01:41.945 --> 04:01:44.967]  Well, hey, you don't like hearing about it, that kid got chopped up!
[04:01:46.007 --> 04:01:52.630]  Okay, and I as a human know that if you can chop up the innocent, man, my kids are next, I'm next, okay?
[04:01:52.910 --> 04:01:53.850]  It's called empathy.
[04:01:54.671 --> 04:01:58.412]  You ever been out somewhere and seen somebody walk out in the street and get hit by a car and die?
[04:01:58.652 --> 04:02:00.433]  I've seen it five times.
[04:02:01.394 --> 04:02:05.895]  I've seen people die in car wrecks, seen them get run over five times.
[04:02:05.955 --> 04:02:11.938]  I saw people race past me on I-30 once and their cars collide and flip and blow up.
[04:02:12.518 --> 04:02:16.560]  And I pulled over to help him and there were heads chopped off and blood spraying out of necks.
[04:02:16.860 --> 04:02:18.821]  And let me tell you something, I got nauseous.
[04:02:19.241 --> 04:02:21.642]  I was trying to help people and I was throwing up.
[04:02:22.002 --> 04:02:23.063]  And you know why I was throwing up?
[04:02:23.123 --> 04:02:24.363]  I'd seen violence on TV.
[04:02:24.623 --> 04:02:26.104]  Folks, this was real.
[04:02:26.364 --> 04:02:27.705]  I could smell their blood.
[04:02:27.945 --> 04:02:30.146]  I could see fire ants crawling on their bodies.
[04:02:30.486 --> 04:02:33.007]  And I had a sympathetic response.
[04:02:34.209 --> 04:02:35.430]  You know what a sympathetic response is?
[04:02:35.450 --> 04:02:37.612]  Like if you see somebody vomit, you feel like you need to vomit?
[04:02:37.912 --> 04:02:44.198]  I mean, you know, you're seeing people around you with one guy with his hand flopping around with blood shooting out of it.
[04:02:44.959 --> 04:02:48.121]  Well, look, at a deep, it's not because I'm some good guy, folks.
[04:02:48.241 --> 04:02:54.027]  It's that it hurts me to see this type of stuff going on, and I know it's only going to get worse.
[04:02:54.307 --> 04:02:56.309]  When I read about them surrounding Fallujah,
[04:02:57.452 --> 04:03:21.024]  When I read about them for months bombarding it, and the Bertovecs, 14 times what they were previously, and our own troops had five to six times increases, and how they were just mowing women down, and stories of a woman walking with a three-year-old in her hand, and the troops shoot her in the head with a .50 cal at 3,000 or whatever yards away, just to see and laugh at her head blowing off.
[04:03:21.846 --> 04:03:30.128]  Man, that the troops could blow her head off while her child was holding her hand and just use her like a target, like her head was a pumpkin.
[04:03:30.828 --> 04:03:39.389]  I realize that that spirit, of course those troops firing that DU rifle, they don't even know that what they're firing is probably going to kill them.
[04:03:39.910 --> 04:03:41.930]  I mean, it's a craziness.
[04:03:42.050 --> 04:03:46.251]  It's a disconnect with reality.
[04:03:47.411 --> 04:03:52.674]  And it's incredibly dangerous, and it's getting worse by the minute.
[04:03:53.315 --> 04:03:59.758]  And that's why I'm here today broadcasting 10-11 hours straight, is because when we're dead, we can rest.
[04:04:00.519 --> 04:04:07.142]  But now is the time to realize that, folks, good people have stood down, and so evil has taken over.
[04:04:07.162 --> 04:04:08.543]  And I know why good people stand down.
[04:04:08.863 --> 04:04:09.884]  It's not even from fear.
[04:04:10.444 --> 04:04:11.625]  Good people are humble.
[04:04:12.245 --> 04:04:16.068]  And good people go, well, I don't want to be up there up at East speaking out.
[04:04:16.168 --> 04:04:17.469]  I don't want to be out in front of everybody.
[04:04:17.549 --> 04:04:19.490]  I don't want to go tell people what I think.
[04:04:19.770 --> 04:04:20.751]  You know, I don't want to.
[04:04:21.211 --> 04:04:23.493]  You've got to stop being so humble, folks.
[04:04:24.073 --> 04:04:32.499]  You've got to continue to be humble, but you've got to manifest your true humility by sacrificing your energy and your time resisting the globalist.
[04:04:33.080 --> 04:04:33.700]  You've got to.
[04:04:34.901 --> 04:04:36.462]  It's not the right word to say, don't be humble.
[04:04:36.502 --> 04:04:40.585]  You've got to get out of a position of being passive and you've got to get aggressive.
[04:04:40.605 --> 04:04:45.788]  And you've got to realize that if you know evil's going on and you don't do something about it, it's on your hands.
[04:04:46.108 --> 04:04:47.669]  And I see converse from that.
[04:04:48.310 --> 04:04:51.292]  Lou Rockwell's coming up for a quick five minute report here in a moment.
[04:04:52.152 --> 04:05:01.074]  With Jakari Jackson, he'll be back with a more extended report after Lou leaves us, and I promise I'll go to Cody, Josh, John, and others that are holding here tonight.
[04:05:01.094 --> 04:05:03.555]  Have you got any reports of election fraud or your take on the election?
[04:05:03.595 --> 04:05:04.495]  It's 877-789-2539.
[04:05:04.635 --> 04:05:08.056]  We're opening the phones up again in a moment.
[04:05:08.076 --> 04:05:08.596]  877-789-2539.
[04:05:08.716 --> 04:05:12.117]  We're going to get to all of you.
[04:05:13.017 --> 04:05:17.038]  But I'm here ranting just about the philosophy of good versus evil.
[04:05:19.710 --> 04:05:27.037]  It's just that so many people want to over calculate things and come up with some perfect master plan to defeat the New World Order.
[04:05:27.517 --> 04:05:28.638]  That's not how things work.
[04:05:29.219 --> 04:05:33.343]  You've got to start small and then have successes and then build on that.
[04:05:34.083 --> 04:05:37.266]  That's why I am at this point of where we finally are having
[04:05:38.379 --> 04:05:49.431]  A real success and I can see where Infowars could lead that I'm not choking, but it is quite a realization to come to this point.
[04:05:50.231 --> 04:05:53.215]  To know that there is a fight between good and evil.
[04:05:53.795 --> 04:06:05.204]  And we can all affect change for something good, but you can't just lazily do it saying Obama's slogans sound better or Mitt Romney's slogans sound better.
[04:06:05.484 --> 04:06:14.370]  And the system has these two candidates so close together in who they really are, but they make it look like there's these big differences.
[04:06:15.413 --> 04:06:16.935]  Both men have supported abortion.
[04:06:16.975 --> 04:06:18.597]  Both men have supported open borders.
[04:06:18.697 --> 04:06:20.520]  Both men have supported carbon taxes.
[04:06:20.840 --> 04:06:23.764]  Both men have supported banning semi-automatic firearms.
[04:06:24.285 --> 04:06:26.228]  Both men have supported NDAA.
[04:06:26.328 --> 04:06:27.750]  Both men have supported torture.
[04:06:28.110 --> 04:06:29.652]  Both men have supported all of this.
[04:06:30.453 --> 04:06:36.217]  Now, Romney, to make you think you have a choice for the illusion, has to act like he's against it.
[04:06:38.278 --> 04:06:39.800]  And maybe he is, but it doesn't matter.
[04:06:40.420 --> 04:06:47.165]  But there's also the point, now that the election's, you know, gonna be a side of one or the other, I can say it, it feels immoral
[04:06:47.785 --> 04:06:50.146]  ...to just sit there and say they're both the same, because they're not.
[04:06:50.486 --> 04:06:58.829]  Obama is playing the role of the guy that takes you further down the path, and then Romney's the placeholder to make you think that there's really a change.
[04:06:59.109 --> 04:07:03.611]  Let's get a five-minute report from our own Jakari Jackson in the InfoWars Nightly News studios.
[04:07:03.651 --> 04:07:04.591]  I'm in the radio studios.
[04:07:05.251 --> 04:07:09.212]  And we have huge record video and audio because we're internet only tonight.
[04:07:09.332 --> 04:07:12.113]  Viewers and listeners, thanks to you spreading the word about the transmission.
[04:07:12.153 --> 04:07:12.813]  Thank you so much.
[04:07:13.153 --> 04:07:14.614]  Please continue to spread the link.
[04:07:14.634 --> 04:07:22.476]  We'll have more live coverage tomorrow on the radio with the link that you have, the video and audio link, and tomorrow night more lengthy coverage of this as it unfolds.
[04:07:22.936 --> 04:07:27.017]  Jakari, give us a quick update and then we're going to come back to you there in the studio.
[04:07:27.822 --> 04:07:28.623]  All right, thanks Alex.
[04:07:28.683 --> 04:07:36.532]  Now if we can take a look at the map right here, scroll down a little bit here, we see Obama at 157 and Mitt Romney at 173.
[04:07:37.213 --> 04:07:40.977]  Scroll down a little bit, you see a lot of red on that map.
[04:07:41.037 --> 04:07:45.242]  We of course see Ohio is not decided, neither is Florida.
[04:07:45.262 --> 04:07:47.305]  We know that Tag Romney has the
[04:07:47.905 --> 04:07:54.693]  The voting machines in Ohio, although they claim that has nothing to do with the voter turnout, we'll see how that turns out to be.
[04:07:55.294 --> 04:07:59.239]  And the close just closed on the West Coast, is that right guys?
[04:07:59.639 --> 04:08:00.240]  At 9 o'clock?
[04:08:00.941 --> 04:08:01.301]  Our time?
[04:08:01.702 --> 04:08:04.686]  So we'll be seeing what happens in the West Coast.
[04:08:05.396 --> 04:08:11.999]  Coming up here pretty soon, we want to find out what turns out with Proposition 37 and also things such as marijuana.
[04:08:12.339 --> 04:08:14.981]  That seems to be a hot topic going on these days.
[04:08:15.341 --> 04:08:18.642]  But if you're watching this, go check out our Twitter page at Puppet Prez.
[04:08:19.023 --> 04:08:22.064]  If we can pull that up and take a look at a few of the posts that we have right there.
[04:08:22.584 --> 04:08:25.986]  Let's see, free thought, Obama for Prez.
[04:08:26.466 --> 04:08:27.907]  Okay, so he thinks Mitt and
[04:08:29.324 --> 04:08:31.825]  And DeBrock are the same guy, which I really wouldn't disagree with.
[04:08:32.245 --> 04:08:34.106]  So scroll down there a little bit more.
[04:08:34.146 --> 04:08:35.426]  We see, are you a zombie?
[04:08:35.566 --> 04:08:36.326]  I'm nervous.
[04:08:36.426 --> 04:08:38.067]  And some other Twitter posts on there.
[04:08:38.487 --> 04:08:42.528]  So definitely check us out at Puppet Prez on the Twitter page.
[04:08:42.548 --> 04:08:44.949]  And that's our most recent updates.
[04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:48.030]  And because, you know, we have the puppet election going on.
[04:08:48.050 --> 04:08:53.711]  And that's why you see all these great graphics made by our Melissa Melton, Darren McBreen, Marcos Morales.
[04:08:54.011 --> 04:08:55.652]  They're bringing you all those puppet graphics.
[04:08:56.032 --> 04:08:58.493]  So actually, we do have a video we like to throw to you.
[04:08:59.553 --> 04:09:01.634]  We are Chained San Antonio.
[04:09:02.035 --> 04:09:05.897]  This is a group that I've actually had a chance to meet when I went down to San Antonio.
[04:09:06.337 --> 04:09:09.378]  So if we can cue that up, guys, go ahead and play it whenever you're ready.
[04:09:09.699 --> 04:09:11.259]  Jokari, we'll do that in a moment.
[04:09:11.279 --> 04:09:13.661]  Did you just get out McBrain's secret nickname on air?
[04:09:14.441 --> 04:09:14.781]  What is it?
[04:09:15.182 --> 04:09:15.862]  Puppet Prez?
[04:09:16.342 --> 04:09:17.203]  Oh, no, no, no.
[04:09:17.223 --> 04:09:21.825]  I don't think I gave away any secret information right there, Alex.
[04:09:21.845 --> 04:09:23.166]  Did you just call him McBrainy?
[04:09:24.262 --> 04:09:25.403]  Did I call him McBrainie?
[04:09:25.423 --> 04:09:27.984]  I don't recall that.
[04:09:28.044 --> 04:09:29.104]  I thought I heard that.
[04:09:29.385 --> 04:09:31.786]  Maybe now when I hear McBrainie, I hear his nickname McBrainie.
[04:09:31.846 --> 04:09:32.266]  I'm sorry.
[04:09:32.306 --> 04:09:33.266]  We love McBrainie.
[04:09:33.366 --> 04:09:35.728]  Well, you spilled the bean, Alex.
[04:09:35.968 --> 04:09:37.889]  I think you were just hopping to say McBrainie.
[04:09:38.349 --> 04:09:39.029]  You know what it is?
[04:09:39.069 --> 04:09:40.390]  McBrainie is the best.
[04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:43.451]  We've got incredible gravity, but I've got to say he is the best we've got.
[04:09:43.471 --> 04:09:44.532]  They're all incredible.
[04:09:44.972 --> 04:09:50.835]  But he is also a great reporter, but he doesn't like to be in front of the camera.
[04:09:51.235 --> 04:09:55.998]  So we're gonna make him, I think I'm gonna call McBreen in here right now and make him get here in studio in a moment.
[04:09:56.138 --> 04:09:58.520]  He's out on the streets with Ortiz, isn't that right, guys?
[04:09:58.840 --> 04:09:59.741]  Yeah, he's out on the streets.
[04:09:59.821 --> 04:10:03.403]  And so we notice Ortiz is now in front of the camera, McBreen is behind the camera.
[04:10:04.381 --> 04:10:06.402]  That is very much true, Alex.
[04:10:06.762 --> 04:10:08.823]  But Ortiz is doing a great job out there.
[04:10:08.943 --> 04:10:10.403]  No, no, he is doing an incredible job.
[04:10:10.983 --> 04:10:13.344]  Yeah, but we'll get McBreen in here a little bit more.
[04:10:13.384 --> 04:10:15.965]  You know, he likes the JFK stuff.
[04:10:16.405 --> 04:10:16.966]  Exactly.
[04:10:16.986 --> 04:10:19.427]  He loves to do JFK reports, which is intriguing.
[04:10:20.807 --> 04:10:24.248]  Listen, your gut, I know you've got a promo you're going to go to from We Are Change.
[04:10:24.648 --> 04:10:26.269]  Who do you think is going to win?
[04:10:26.449 --> 04:10:28.510]  I mean, who do you think the Globalists are going to select here?
[04:10:29.330 --> 04:10:35.136]  Well, before I saw these recent polls, I was going to say Barack Obama, but now it's looking like Mitt Romney.
[04:10:35.617 --> 04:10:39.721]  I see a lot of red on that map when I take a look at it, but I thought it was going to be Obama.
[04:10:40.121 --> 04:10:44.586]  I thought they had their hooks pretty good into him, and they were just going to manipulate him.
[04:10:46.912 --> 04:11:01.523]  The people's perception, or at least what I thought before the polls came out, was that Obama was the guy, they did a pretty good job demonizing Mitt Romney from what I saw, and a lot of Obama supporters were pretty much keen to vote for him regardless of what he did.
[04:11:01.743 --> 04:11:07.307]  We saw the video, Rob showed us a video earlier that Luke Hradowski did where he asked people,
[04:11:08.067 --> 04:11:09.488]  Uh, what if Mitt Romney did this?
[04:11:09.528 --> 04:11:10.669]  And what if Mitt Romney did that?
[04:11:10.689 --> 04:11:12.690]  And people said, oh, that's terrible, I hate Mitt Romney.
[04:11:13.050 --> 04:11:17.932]  And then Luke said, well, not only is Barack Obama talking about doing these things, he's already implemented them.
[04:11:18.293 --> 04:11:19.773]  Things such as, yeah, the NDAA.
[04:11:19.813 --> 04:11:23.956]  So it seems to me that... No, exactly, but I mean, that's what's interesting is that people
[04:11:25.532 --> 04:11:26.272]  But it's the same thing.
[04:11:26.292 --> 04:11:31.975]  You can tell Romney supporters about something Obama did, and they say it's horrible, but then Mitt Romney supports it.
[04:11:32.355 --> 04:11:34.716]  But listen, they haven't gotten to the West Coast yet.
[04:11:35.677 --> 04:11:37.778]  And so I think it's still going to be neck and neck here.
[04:11:37.838 --> 04:11:42.600]  But all these bookies and stuff saying it wasn't going to be close at all, they were clearly just trying to throw stuff.
[04:11:43.220 --> 04:11:46.621]  But again, I mean, it's like watching a rigged horse race.
[04:11:47.122 --> 04:11:49.503]  It is so ridiculous that we're one of the only
[04:11:50.740 --> 04:11:53.121]  Groups out there pointing out this whole thing's a fraud.
[04:11:53.461 --> 04:11:57.363]  Most of them, Jakari, are acting like it's completely real and, you know, it really matters.
[04:11:58.043 --> 04:12:02.145]  Oh yeah, they push off this voter fraud as if it's some kind of myth.
[04:12:02.585 --> 04:12:08.908]  You know, we have the documents, we've been documenting for the past several weeks, if not longer than that, telling you about all the voter fraud.
[04:12:08.928 --> 04:12:16.412]  Like I just mentioned, Tag Romney owned the voting machines in Ohio, even though they say they bought those voting machines before Tag, you know, bought his.
[04:12:16.972 --> 04:12:20.875]  But I mean, I think they have to get scheduled maintenance at least every now and then.
[04:12:21.235 --> 04:12:23.056]  And it's just, it's examples like that.
[04:12:23.076 --> 04:12:29.220]  You know, votes are disappearing and it's been said before and I don't think voter fraud is a myth.
[04:12:29.260 --> 04:12:31.702]  It's very much something that's alive in this country today.
[04:12:32.697 --> 04:12:33.818]  Well, it certainly is.
[04:12:33.838 --> 04:12:35.898]  You know, we're getting him lined up on Skype right now.
[04:12:35.938 --> 04:12:39.340]  Lou Rockwell for about 25 minutes, we'll come back to you, Jakari, and then phone calls.
[04:12:39.400 --> 04:12:42.281]  But, I mean, they've been caught over and over again doing it.
[04:12:42.341 --> 04:12:43.642]  We would be naive.
[04:12:44.182 --> 04:12:45.783]  But, I mean, people know what's going on now.
[04:12:45.883 --> 04:12:48.804]  So, and there's more reports this year than I think I've ever seen.
[04:12:48.884 --> 04:12:59.229]  So, uh, I just hope... You've seen the reports where people, they go in and they hit the button that says, you know, Barack or Mitt or whatever their choice is, and it comes up the other candidate.
[04:12:59.930 --> 04:13:02.431]  You know, it's completely ridiculous.
[04:13:02.471 --> 04:13:08.392]  And even with the paper ballots, I mean, they can just scrap the paper ballots, hide the paper ballots, whatever they want to do with them.
[04:13:08.792 --> 04:13:12.673]  And you talked about earlier how dead people are voting.
[04:13:13.153 --> 04:13:17.514]  You talked about the guy whose dead mother was voting right before he did.
[04:13:17.895 --> 04:13:19.375]  So there's plenty of fraud out there, Alex.
[04:13:19.975 --> 04:13:21.697]  Jakari, we're going to go to Lou Rockwell.
[04:13:22.517 --> 04:13:26.921]  Again, we have just a massive audience out there watching us on the internet, listening to the streams.
[04:13:28.682 --> 04:13:32.185]  We are just getting up on our hind legs right now, learning how to walk here.
[04:13:32.926 --> 04:13:35.288]  This is just the beginning of InfoWars Nightly News.
[04:13:35.328 --> 04:13:36.248]  This is just the beginning.
[04:13:36.669 --> 04:13:43.434]  Everything we've done, by the grace of God, and our listeners, supporters out there spreading the word and supporting us,
[04:13:44.275 --> 04:13:47.656]  This is just the beginning, and it's a great example of free association.
[04:13:48.017 --> 04:13:51.058]  We don't get funded like MSNBC by bank or bailout money.
[04:13:51.378 --> 04:13:52.999]  We don't get funded by George Soros.
[04:13:53.579 --> 04:14:07.185]  We are funded by the viewers, the listeners, the freedom lovers out there across the United States, but also all over the world, people that have a hunger for freedom and a hunger for a true level playing field and a true free market.
[04:14:07.905 --> 04:14:26.746]  And it is just so exciting to know that we've been successful with PrisonPlanet.com, with InfoWars.com, we've been successful with the new magazine, we've been successful with the nightly news, the radio show now reaching 15 million people a week, and thanks to you, Jakari Jackson, David Ortiz, Dan Bodondi, Melissa Melton,
[04:14:26.786 --> 04:14:27.366]  You have power.
[04:14:52.767 --> 04:15:04.731]  Yeah, just like you said Alex, I mean, because everybody, I meet a lot of people, well I say I talk to a lot of people, you know, about the show, and they say, well I really wish you guys would report on this, or you would report on that, or you would come to my town.
[04:15:04.791 --> 04:15:09.133]  I say don't wait for InfoWars, don't wait for Alex Jones to report on your issue.
[04:15:09.473 --> 04:15:15.095]  You can affect change, go to your city council meetings, your student council meetings, whatever the issue may be.
[04:15:15.735 --> 04:15:20.219]  Get heard, you know, don't wait for us to get a story or get it reported to your location.
[04:15:20.539 --> 04:15:22.241]  Go out and effect change for yourself.
[04:15:22.901 --> 04:15:23.922]  No, no, no.
[04:15:24.062 --> 04:15:24.683]  I mean, exactly.
[04:15:24.723 --> 04:15:26.564]  People all the time say, why haven't you covered this shit?
[04:15:26.604 --> 04:15:28.826]  Well, they're just now telling us about it.
[04:15:29.407 --> 04:15:30.908]  And we're regular people, too.
[04:15:30.948 --> 04:15:39.155]  The point is, we think of specialists and government as being the answer when they can't even get aid to people in Katrina or New York or New Jersey.
[04:15:39.455 --> 04:15:41.617]  Jakari Jackson, we'll be back to you in about 30 minutes.
[04:15:41.657 --> 04:15:42.358]  Thank you so much.
[04:15:42.938 --> 04:15:43.479]  Thank you, Alex.
[04:15:44.079 --> 04:15:46.782]  All right, folks, there goes Jakari Jackson.
[04:15:47.042 --> 04:15:51.146]  And again, this is real independent media.
[04:15:51.206 --> 04:15:53.508]  We're getting our satellite uplinks and more.
[04:15:53.548 --> 04:15:54.850]  We already have them for the radio show.
[04:15:55.650 --> 04:15:59.314]  And it's just so exciting to know that, yeah, I've been on air now.
[04:15:59.614 --> 04:16:00.856]  I don't know, 10 hours today.
[04:16:00.876 --> 04:16:04.802]  And I'm still going here and I'm teleprompter free, thank God.
[04:16:04.822 --> 04:16:09.470]  And speaking of somebody else who's teleprompter free, he heads up LewRockwell.com.
[04:16:09.510 --> 04:16:11.132]  And by the way, his name is Lew Rockwell.
[04:16:11.473 --> 04:16:14.497]  He's the founder and head of the Von Mies Institute.
[04:16:15.718 --> 04:16:19.420]  And he is also the former Chief of Staff for Congressman Ron Paul.
[04:16:19.820 --> 04:16:23.441]  He's an author and researcher and a true brain trust for Liberty.
[04:16:23.881 --> 04:16:24.941]  And I want to thank him.
[04:16:24.961 --> 04:16:34.525]  I guess he's out there on the East Coast, I think, right now at 1037 for joining us, 937 Central, to break down this giant puppet show.
[04:16:34.585 --> 04:16:39.186]  I know we know that, but I want his take on where it's all going.
[04:16:39.707 --> 04:16:41.747]  Lew Rockwell, thank you so much for coming on, sir.
[04:16:42.548 --> 04:16:43.468]  Alex, great to be with you.
[04:16:44.761 --> 04:16:46.042]  Wow, so much is happening.
[04:16:46.082 --> 04:16:49.645]  I've got a million questions, but out of the gates, what is on Lou Rockwell's mind?
[04:16:50.705 --> 04:17:01.553]  Well, it's interesting to me, and I guess we've known this for some time, that apparently Obama is the choice of the oligarchy to be the button on their lapel for the next four years.
[04:17:01.633 --> 04:17:04.996]  We shouldn't assume that the President actually is running things.
[04:17:05.556 --> 04:17:06.237]  He's being run.
[04:17:07.378 --> 04:17:10.180]  He's given a schedule every day that he follows.
[04:17:13.402 --> 04:17:14.843]  It's the oligarchy that runs things.
[04:17:14.883 --> 04:17:19.646]  So they've decided that they're better off with another four years of Obama than four years of Romney.
[04:17:20.247 --> 04:17:22.629]  These two men are really two peas in a pod.
[04:17:23.009 --> 04:17:26.972]  I mean, one is a fascistic socialist, the other is a socialistic fascist.
[04:17:27.432 --> 04:17:36.741]  But there really is not significant difference, except some of the interest groups that grow rich and powerful off their presidencies are different.
[04:17:36.761 --> 04:17:41.346]  I mean, that's true that some big pharma may do better under Romney, but maybe not.
[04:17:41.366 --> 04:17:45.690]  It does very well under Obama, the military-industrial complex certainly will do well under both of them.
[04:17:46.450 --> 04:17:47.951]  So this is all just a game.
[04:17:47.971 --> 04:17:50.873]  I mean, the Romans had their bread and circuses.
[04:17:50.913 --> 04:17:54.316]  We've got our elections and welfare system.
[04:17:54.876 --> 04:17:56.797]  So this is all just a trick.
[04:17:57.258 --> 04:18:09.966]  It's slightly discouraging to see how many Americans fall for it, although we should always remember that far more Americans refuse to vote than vote either Republican or Democratic because they realize it's all a fraud.
[04:18:09.986 --> 04:18:10.847]  It's just a joke.
[04:18:11.927 --> 04:18:12.948]  Their vote makes no difference.
[04:18:13.028 --> 04:18:14.728]  It's a pain in the neck, of course, to go vote.
[04:18:15.129 --> 04:18:19.090]  And when you vote, you're sort of giving your endorsement to the whole system.
[04:18:19.170 --> 04:18:25.032]  So a huge number of Americans, perhaps 45% of the potential electorate, don't vote.
[04:18:25.472 --> 04:18:26.933]  So that's good news.
[04:18:27.493 --> 04:18:30.434]  But the majority of people are caught up in this.
[04:18:30.734 --> 04:18:34.956]  They think there's actually something to be achieved by having either Romney or Obama
[04:18:35.336 --> 04:18:43.443]  When they both represent the same group of plutocrats and the oligarchy of government, parties are different.
[04:18:43.723 --> 04:18:47.526]  As Gerald Selenny would tell us, you know, there's a difference between the Bananos and the Gambinos.
[04:18:47.546 --> 04:18:54.432]  They really do fight each other, but for the rest of us, there's not too much of a difference.
[04:18:54.793 --> 04:18:59.857]  So the Republicans and Democrats are two wings to the same bird of prey, as Butler Schaeffer always puts it.
[04:19:00.541 --> 04:19:05.327]  I know that not only do you study economics, you study history.
[04:19:06.028 --> 04:19:09.613]  Again, if you're joining us, listening on the radio, it's Lew Rockwell, lewrockwell.com.
[04:19:10.113 --> 04:19:12.557]  Obviously, TV viewers can see him right there on our screen.
[04:19:13.378 --> 04:19:14.459]  Joining us via Skype.
[04:19:16.401 --> 04:19:23.204]  As a person who studied history, you know, myself, I've decided to try to weather the storm, stay here in America.
[04:19:23.584 --> 04:19:26.485]  It's not perfect, but there's nowhere really to run.
[04:19:26.505 --> 04:19:28.886]  I mean, there's big government and tyranny all over the world.
[04:19:29.486 --> 04:19:30.667]  Unfortunately, the U.S.
[04:19:30.707 --> 04:19:36.769]  now has, you know, fallen in the ranks to not one of the best places economically to live or politically.
[04:19:38.690 --> 04:19:41.012]  What is your view on the future of America?
[04:19:41.032 --> 04:19:47.639]  I mean privately when you're sitting around say talking to Ron Paul like you were a few weekends ago at your big event you guys had.
[04:19:48.599 --> 04:19:53.184]  Where do you really see us going and where do you see this ruling class going?
[04:19:53.224 --> 04:19:53.824]  Because we see
[04:19:54.685 --> 04:20:04.312]  We see all these court rulings saying we're going to come into your house and if the drug dog without a warrant smells drugs, we're going to randomly walk up and down your street, we're going to bust down your door.
[04:20:04.872 --> 04:20:07.254]  And we're going to put GPS on your car without a warrant.
[04:20:07.794 --> 04:20:10.476]  And we're going to pull you over and download your phone.
[04:20:10.936 --> 04:20:13.258]  And we're going to have the TSA download your laptop.
[04:20:13.478 --> 04:20:14.418]  And we're going to...
[04:20:15.459 --> 04:20:20.761]  Have the NSA spying on you without warrants, and we're going to put cameras in your backyard and watch you without warrants.
[04:20:21.602 --> 04:20:29.485]  I mean, it's absurdist how tyrannical it's getting, and it's just getting going fast.
[04:20:29.965 --> 04:20:31.686]  So what's happening to America?
[04:20:31.746 --> 04:20:33.127]  Where do you see it, Lew Rockwell?
[04:20:33.627 --> 04:20:35.088]  Well, Alex, you're certainly right.
[04:20:35.668 --> 04:20:36.689]  This is a police state.
[04:20:37.589 --> 04:20:42.112]  It's not a Soviet or a Nazi police state yet, but it's headed in that direction.
[04:20:42.472 --> 04:20:46.435]  Especially if we consider what was the case just 15 or 20 years ago.
[04:20:47.956 --> 04:20:50.777]  There were many bad things that went on, but it's not like today.
[04:20:51.098 --> 04:20:52.899]  And of course, kill lists and the drones.
[04:20:53.719 --> 04:21:08.425]  I don't know when this whole system is going to come down.
[04:21:08.865 --> 04:21:20.350]  We've never had anything like the current economic system in the history of the world where you have every single country with a central bank massively printing up fiat currency, increasing the money supply,
[04:21:21.738 --> 04:21:21.938]  I think?
[04:21:42.006 --> 04:21:45.831]  For Japan, for countries all over the world, it's very bad.
[04:21:45.851 --> 04:21:49.135]  I do think that the human race has a good future.
[04:21:49.155 --> 04:21:53.220]  I think that mankind will end up triumphing over this.
[04:21:53.541 --> 04:21:55.583]  But I think we're going to have some very rough times.
[04:21:56.124 --> 04:21:58.047]  And I hope people are preparing themselves.
[04:21:58.067 --> 04:21:59.749]  We can take a look at what happened in Manhattan.
[04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:04.171]  And those people, some of those people were prepared, others weren't.
[04:22:04.612 --> 04:22:10.115]  We all have to be prepared in terms of whether it's a governmentally caused disaster or a natural disaster.
[04:22:10.475 --> 04:22:11.095]  That's important.
[04:22:11.115 --> 04:22:14.097]  It's important that you have some money out of the bank, out of the banks.
[04:22:14.177 --> 04:22:17.259]  It's important that you have gold and silver in your own possession.
[04:22:17.279 --> 04:22:20.981]  Other things you can do, you can cut down on your debts and that sort of thing.
[04:22:21.604 --> 04:22:24.268]  But these are difficult times.
[04:22:25.569 --> 04:22:32.579]  Professor Jack Douglas said today that we're living in the lull before the social unrest is coming.
[04:22:33.200 --> 04:22:36.364]  So we have a lot of troubles ahead.
[04:22:36.384 --> 04:22:37.525]  On the other hand,
[04:22:38.206 --> 04:22:55.606]  There's still this is the market still great so many great entrepreneurs many great working people many of the American people are still a great people they've been brainwashed they've been fooled but they can come back it is possible for people to change their minds it is possible we only have to look at the impact
[04:22:55.606 --> 04:22:56.006]  Exactly, I mean...
[04:23:22.288 --> 04:23:25.792]  America used to be an example of freedom, now it's become an example of tyranny.
[04:23:26.192 --> 04:23:29.215]  But people all over the world now can say, hey, Americans aren't bad.
[04:23:29.636 --> 04:23:30.637]  Look at Ron Paul.
[04:23:30.737 --> 04:23:35.322]  And by the way, I had lost contact with some of my contacts to Ron Paul.
[04:23:35.362 --> 04:23:37.123]  Thank you for getting Ron Paul in touch with us.
[04:23:37.143 --> 04:23:37.984]  He's on the show Friday.
[04:23:38.004 --> 04:23:43.270]  Yeah, he's delighted to be on, and it's so great for you to have him on and for him to be on.
[04:23:43.650 --> 04:23:44.110]  Oh, you bet.
[04:23:44.130 --> 04:23:45.010]  We're glad to have him.
[04:23:45.031 --> 04:23:49.012]  It's been a few months, like three or four or longer, since he's been on the show.
[04:23:49.612 --> 04:23:57.795]  Continuing here, I mean, I hate to sit here and just say bad news, bad news, bad news, but in my experience, it's not admitting how much trouble we're in that's gotten us into this.
[04:23:58.155 --> 04:24:00.756]  You talk about civil unrest, it's really two worlds.
[04:24:01.236 --> 04:24:07.458]  You've either got people that are more awake, working harder than ever, and more productive than ever, almost survival of the fittest,
[04:24:08.158 --> 04:24:11.539]  Versus slobs everywhere, and let's be honest, they're out there.
[04:24:12.099 --> 04:24:34.703]  Zombie-like people, and then the predatory minions in government, and then the crony capitalists that feed at that, and clearly they're moving towards more authoritarianism because tyranny doesn't work, they're destroying the golden goose, so their answer is, don't go back to liberty, let's just bring in pure tyranny.
[04:24:36.383 --> 04:24:38.247]  It's that same ham-fisted trait.
[04:24:38.748 --> 04:24:43.075]  Why do you think the establishment is going light speed towards tyranny?
[04:24:43.476 --> 04:24:45.780]  Is that a sign of their strength or a sign of their weakness?
[04:24:46.738 --> 04:24:49.941]  Well, I think it's a sign of the nature of government.
[04:24:49.981 --> 04:24:54.144]  I think every government would like to be a totalitarian state, if they can get away with it.
[04:24:54.665 --> 04:25:01.971]  And after 9-11, we saw a huge pullback by the American people in their opposition to government power.
[04:25:02.512 --> 04:25:10.659]  And throughout human history, we can look at, it's always a battle between market and power, between the government and the coercive forces, and the private
[04:25:13.302 --> 04:25:13.722]  We're good to go.
[04:25:36.845 --> 04:25:39.187]  And again, great businessmen, great entrepreneurs.
[04:25:39.547 --> 04:25:43.490]  The market can't be actually put out of business by the government.
[04:25:43.731 --> 04:25:50.416]  Even the Soviet Union, even Mao Tse Tung's China, even Pol Pot's Cambodia could not put the market out of business.
[04:25:53.299 --> 04:25:56.301]  I guess the government estimates 50 million people are out of the system.
[04:25:56.341 --> 04:25:57.062]  I think it's more.
[04:25:57.522 --> 04:26:10.413]  I know a lot of these really dynamic software engineers, business owners, and they have made the decision, even though it's harder for them to not be sucked off by parasites, that they are almost completely out of the system.
[04:26:10.713 --> 04:26:15.197]  And you notice this whole cashless society system that you've talked so much about.
[04:26:15.837 --> 04:26:29.403]  It is obsessed with shutting down the archetypes of the lemonade stands, the Amish, the people selling pumpkins, the people selling bonsai trees, the people selling handmade woodwork, harassing the farmer's markets.
[04:26:29.763 --> 04:26:33.324]  This whole new world order that's so big and bad, Lou, explain this to us.
[04:26:33.684 --> 04:26:39.867]  Why are they so scared to death of even little, small markets that aren't under their control?
[04:26:40.759 --> 04:26:44.980]  Well, they're scared because they represent lies, and we represent the truth.
[04:26:45.540 --> 04:26:50.102]  And a little lemonade stand represents economic truth, as versus the lies of the government.
[04:26:50.482 --> 04:26:59.124]  And there was just a recent report from the Federal Reserve taking great alarm at the vastly increasing number of Americans who are, as they put it, unbanked and non-banked.
[04:26:59.833 --> 04:27:05.378]  People who either are too poor to use banks or just don't want to, and other people who just don't want to use the banks.
[04:27:05.859 --> 04:27:12.745]  So it's, it's, it's one of the things we can all do if we want to strike back at the system that it's strangling us, strangling our liberties.
[04:27:13.165 --> 04:27:15.708]  Do everything you can to live outside the banks.
[04:27:16.168 --> 04:27:18.370]  Yeah, I've thought about paying my employees.
[04:27:18.390 --> 04:27:25.397]  It has something to do with the banks, but we don't have to keep all our money in the banks to get that, what, one-eighth of a percent interest or whatever they're paying us?
[04:27:26.431 --> 04:27:28.992]  Sure, so why is the system so scared of cash?
[04:27:29.032 --> 04:27:33.174]  Like you said, they have billboards up all over the country now saying cash is dirty.
[04:27:33.194 --> 04:27:33.914]  Have you seen those?
[04:27:34.714 --> 04:27:40.036]  No, I haven't, but I'm not surprised, but it's because the banking system is a fraudulent system.
[04:27:40.056 --> 04:27:41.857]  It's based on fractional reserves.
[04:27:42.617 --> 04:27:47.579]  Your money is not actually in there, so that it doesn't take very many customers trying to get their
[04:27:54.332 --> 04:27:54.592]  Thank you.
[04:28:11.512 --> 04:28:12.052]  It hurts them.
[04:28:12.092 --> 04:28:14.414]  You only have to see what I'm talking about.
[04:28:14.694 --> 04:28:21.701]  Try to go take a couple thousand dollars, let's say, out of your bank if you want to pay your bills in cash for some period of time.
[04:28:21.721 --> 04:28:23.442]  They treat you like a criminal.
[04:28:24.183 --> 04:28:26.165]  How dare you take your money out of the bank?
[04:28:26.705 --> 04:28:27.506]  They don't like it.
[04:28:27.966 --> 04:28:30.689]  So there's a signal that you ought to be doing it.
[04:28:32.995 --> 04:28:33.396]  I think so.
[04:28:51.715 --> 04:28:52.456]  Libertarianism
[04:29:15.125 --> 04:29:16.666]  They're finding the truth, by the way.
[04:29:17.647 --> 04:29:22.269]  I'm very optimistic about the younger generation, the Ron Paul generation.
[04:29:22.729 --> 04:29:23.590]  It's quite something.
[04:29:23.650 --> 04:29:30.974]  So us older people, maybe we're for the most part lost, but that's not true as you go down the age spectrum.
[04:29:31.354 --> 04:29:32.394]  So there's real change coming.
[04:29:32.474 --> 04:29:33.855]  I was about to say, real change.
[04:29:33.915 --> 04:29:35.176]  I've seen the numbers as you have.
[04:29:35.196 --> 04:29:36.176]  We're not just typing this.
[04:29:36.877 --> 04:29:40.819]  If you look at young people who the media claims are a bunch of idiots who don't know anything,
[04:29:41.599 --> 04:29:46.041]  Those that are politically aware are really getting it that you can't trust the system.
[04:29:46.081 --> 04:29:47.162]  They don't like the government.
[04:29:47.682 --> 04:29:50.424]  In fact, we've gone out and interviewed people and so have other reporters.
[04:29:50.884 --> 04:29:53.345]  Even Obama supporters know he's horrible now.
[04:29:53.385 --> 04:29:55.366]  They just say, well, he's better than Romney.
[04:29:56.107 --> 04:29:58.828]  And sure, Republicans say, we know Romney's bad.
[04:29:58.868 --> 04:29:59.708]  He's better than Obama.
[04:30:00.009 --> 04:30:07.993]  But at least Democrats, who are usually, as you know, extremely cult-like, they now at least don't think Obama is the second coming of Christ.
[04:30:09.042 --> 04:30:09.202]  I don't
[04:30:26.886 --> 04:30:27.086]  I don't
[04:30:47.606 --> 04:30:48.347]  Well, that's true.
[04:30:48.387 --> 04:30:49.308]  What you just said is deep.
[04:30:49.348 --> 04:30:50.510]  I want you to elaborate on that.
[04:30:50.530 --> 04:30:56.137]  You know, some good old boys are like, oh, we're going to get free oil from Iraq, as if the globalists are going to give you oil they steal.
[04:30:56.838 --> 04:31:04.749]  But I mean, speaking to the American people, if the New World Order hates wild, you know, Afghans because they can't be controlled,
[04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:06.890]  Imagine how much they hate us.
[04:31:06.930 --> 04:31:10.811]  And I've read the writings, as you have, of different collectivists and globalists.
[04:31:11.071 --> 04:31:13.332]  They've always said we're the target to take down.
[04:31:13.652 --> 04:31:14.912]  Don't people get that?
[04:31:15.012 --> 04:31:19.434]  That socialism does not work and delivers hell on earth?
[04:31:20.054 --> 04:31:22.675]  I mean, it is such an easy thing to understand.
[04:31:23.732 --> 04:31:27.497]  Well it's true and of course it's why actually, maybe they've actually learned something.
[04:31:27.517 --> 04:31:31.563]  It's tough to believe the people, the elite in the government have actually learned something.
[04:31:31.803 --> 04:31:35.127]  But it's really why they prefer fascism today than communism.
[04:31:35.528 --> 04:31:41.216]  Because fascism is slightly more economically productive than communism and gives therefore them more money to live it up.
[04:31:41.776 --> 04:31:44.477]  Because, of course, they want to live it up.
[04:31:44.517 --> 04:31:51.560]  But the thing we always have to keep in mind is that the power elite is necessarily a tiny minority.
[04:31:51.841 --> 04:32:02.805]  And those of us who are being ripped off by them, who are being ruled by them, lied to by them, oppressed by them, felt up by them at the airport and all the rest of the things the government does to us, we are the vast majority.
[04:32:03.126 --> 04:32:04.566]  We don't have to put up with it.
[04:32:04.926 --> 04:32:06.427]  So the more that we learn our
[04:32:08.807 --> 04:32:09.508]  I think?
[04:32:30.879 --> 04:32:31.159]  I think
[04:32:48.213 --> 04:32:53.518]  That was my next question.
[04:32:53.719 --> 04:33:01.065]  I've got a great crew and I do have some good moments but overall I find my show, except when I have great guests on, you know, unlistenable at times.
[04:33:01.466 --> 04:33:06.350]  But still, because it is organic and isn't teleprompter controlled and is real,
[04:33:07.151 --> 04:33:10.332]  It grows by leaps and bounds, just like Ron Paul has been growing.
[04:33:10.732 --> 04:33:16.413]  This broadcast is now on, the latest number's coming in, probably over 140 AM and FM stations.
[04:33:16.833 --> 04:33:20.074]  And that's a lot with this message, and a lot of them are big stations now.
[04:33:20.994 --> 04:33:26.796]  And the message is getting number one ratings in many cities, even up against mainline neocon types.
[04:33:27.296 --> 04:33:32.517]  And so I'm now at the point of realizing, well, freedom is popular, like Ron Paul and you have said.
[04:33:33.197 --> 04:33:44.087]  And so my point here is, we've got so many good things that are happening, but so many bad things, but I see the move towards censorship, the cyber security, the fairness doctrine.
[04:33:44.407 --> 04:33:53.756]  It's got to make the system mad that they can spend 300, 400 million a year to run MSNBC, and for five and a half million, I can run something.
[04:33:53.796 --> 04:33:54.477]  This isn't hype.
[04:33:54.517 --> 04:33:57.780]  If you go to Alexa.com, if you go to Google Analytics,
[04:33:58.420 --> 04:34:02.343]  We have more listeners than MSNBC with its million-top show.
[04:34:02.363 --> 04:34:03.884]  We have three million during the radio show.
[04:34:04.265 --> 04:34:08.048]  We have a million-plus people coming to the websites a day, and it's growing.
[04:34:08.468 --> 04:34:13.452]  All totaled 15 million a week, and that's an example of freedom and free market.
[04:34:13.772 --> 04:34:23.920]  Five and a half million versus 300 million, and they've got these giant fancy sets and thousands of crew members, and they cannot get the hearts and minds
[04:34:24.520 --> 04:34:27.864]  I'm just waiting for everybody else to come in for the big victory against these slobs.
[04:34:28.205 --> 04:34:37.817]  Because, you know, if my dumb ass can be kicking their butt, what can the really powerful people that I know are out there do if they'll just start thinking of themselves as leaders, Lou?
[04:34:38.938 --> 04:34:41.762]  Well, Alex, of course, you've got a tremendous audience.
[04:34:44.775 --> 04:34:45.356]  The truth.
[04:35:05.959 --> 04:35:06.360]  God.
[04:35:06.520 --> 04:35:07.621]  That's what they would like.
[04:35:07.641 --> 04:35:11.145]  They would like the government is actually God.
[04:35:11.825 --> 04:35:13.727]  So they always are in competition with God.
[04:35:13.747 --> 04:35:15.269]  It's why they don't like religion.
[04:35:15.569 --> 04:35:17.211]  It's why they don't like families.
[04:35:17.251 --> 04:35:24.378]  They're in competition with anything that stands, as the late Robert Nisbet, the great libertarian sociologist, pointed out.
[04:35:25.699 --> 04:35:36.881]  They hate churches, they hate businesses, they hate radio shows like yours, they hate the family, they hate the neighborhood, they hate... so they want to break all this down.
[04:35:37.301 --> 04:35:39.381]  They hate anything organic.
[04:35:40.302 --> 04:35:42.502]  Well, they do, but you know what?
[04:35:42.862 --> 04:35:46.463]  There's a revolution coming, an intellectual revolution.
[04:35:47.383 --> 04:35:49.643]  More and more people are saying they're not going to put up with it.
[04:35:49.923 --> 04:35:52.384]  More and more people are learning.
[04:35:52.904 --> 04:35:54.464]  Ron Paul always says that really
[04:35:55.225 --> 04:35:57.386]  People like us are born libertarians.
[04:35:57.426 --> 04:36:02.409]  We're born loving freedom, so that the whole process is a matter of discovery for us.
[04:36:02.469 --> 04:36:04.350]  It's not so much a process of conversion.
[04:36:04.830 --> 04:36:07.471]  And again, we only need a minority.
[04:36:07.611 --> 04:36:11.033]  Everything for good or ill is done by motivated minorities.
[04:36:11.473 --> 04:36:12.674]  We only need a minority.
[04:36:12.714 --> 04:36:14.215]  We already have a tremendous minority.
[04:36:14.235 --> 04:36:20.238]  A motivated minority to set brush fires in the minds of men, as Thomas Jefferson said, if I'm paraphrasing the right founding fathers.
[04:36:20.418 --> 04:36:23.379]  But getting back to my little rant, my question to you is,
[04:36:24.740 --> 04:36:26.901]  At what point have they gotten to?
[04:36:27.001 --> 04:36:34.486]  Because if you look at mainstream media, as you know, 10 years ago, before they had real competition, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, they were dominant.
[04:36:34.746 --> 04:36:36.407]  They're still playing the old game.
[04:36:36.787 --> 04:36:43.931]  Have they figured out yet that intellectually, with people that can actually tie their shoelaces, they've already lost?
[04:36:45.120 --> 04:37:05.495]  Well, I think they're concerned, and although they still pretend that we're all being run by the New York Times or the Washington Post or these other antique mediums, so that it's, you know, they live in the past, they are afraid, they revel in their power.
[04:37:05.515 --> 04:37:06.556]  I also think they tend to be
[04:37:06.636 --> 04:37:07.638]  That's crazy.
[04:37:07.658 --> 04:37:11.044]  I think there's a crazy gene in these people.
[04:37:11.144 --> 04:37:15.131]  Man is not meant to rule over others like that.
[04:37:15.191 --> 04:37:16.794]  It's not a natural thing.
[04:37:16.854 --> 04:37:17.695]  It's not a good thing.
[04:37:21.684 --> 04:37:22.204]  We have what St.
[04:37:22.224 --> 04:37:31.806]  Augustine called the libido dominante, the lust to rule, the perverted desire for power over others and to rule others.
[04:37:33.087 --> 04:37:34.547]  There's something crazy about them.
[04:37:34.727 --> 04:37:37.408]  Not only are they evil, they're crazy.
[04:37:37.508 --> 04:37:41.529]  So we have sanity on our side as well as the truth.
[04:37:41.929 --> 04:37:44.049]  So I think they're right to be worried.
[04:37:44.650 --> 04:37:50.351]  I always think of the analogy as, think of the people as like a huge dog
[04:37:57.025 --> 04:37:58.426]  The dog's going to scratch them off.
[04:37:58.887 --> 04:37:59.327]  And you know what?
[04:37:59.447 --> 04:38:01.109]  The dog can scratch them off.
[04:38:01.569 --> 04:38:09.117]  So I think the future can be very bright, even though there's some serious economic troubles coming in the interim.
[04:38:09.437 --> 04:38:16.264]  But when I look at that younger generation, or when, Alex, I look at the size of your audience, I can't help but feel hopeful for the future.
[04:38:17.421 --> 04:38:18.102]  Absolutely.
[04:38:18.122 --> 04:38:22.604]  In closing, in the five minutes we've got left with Lew Rockwell, LewRockwell.com.
[04:38:23.365 --> 04:38:32.730]  It is so important for viewers out there to spread the word about LewRockwell.com or Campaign for Liberty or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com because it is your power.
[04:38:32.890 --> 04:38:34.952]  Voting with your time and energy, spreading the word.
[04:38:35.312 --> 04:38:36.513]  You already know this stuff.
[04:38:37.193 --> 04:38:38.114]  Who have you reached today?
[04:38:38.154 --> 04:38:39.736]  You know, that's why I put the magazine out.
[04:38:40.116 --> 04:38:42.099]  We put over 100,000 of them out a month down.
[04:38:42.139 --> 04:38:43.080]  That's just the beta test.
[04:38:43.580 --> 04:38:50.068]  And when I go to the park or I go to a business or I go to get my hair cut, I keep hundreds in my vehicle.
[04:38:50.228 --> 04:38:51.710]  And even though I'm already putting
[04:38:52.750 --> 04:38:55.812]  80,000 on the streets of Austin mailing out 30,000 to listeners.
[04:38:56.292 --> 04:39:12.900]  I still drop them everywhere because it's a real pleasure, almost a ritual, to plant those seeds doing this because it's fun to sabotage the tyrants because the tyrants, they count on us just going along and feeling powerless.
[04:39:12.920 --> 04:39:13.500]  Let me ask you this.
[04:39:13.580 --> 04:39:15.201]  Why are you concerned about civil unrest?
[04:39:15.221 --> 04:39:20.003]  What do you see happening economically in the short and mid and long-term future, briefly?
[04:39:20.603 --> 04:39:22.985]  And then I want to ask you one final question.
[04:39:23.406 --> 04:39:26.709]  Why were you saying you think the establishment has chosen Obama?
[04:39:26.729 --> 04:39:28.590]  You can take either question in order.
[04:39:28.610 --> 04:39:31.333]  Well, I think, first of all, I think
[04:39:32.243 --> 04:39:51.898]  I'm afraid if we have the kind of economic troubles we're going to have, if we have an actual demise of the dollar, of the federal treasury bonds, of the whole apparatus, the banking system and so forth, which is I think on very loose legs at the moment, and they continue of course to print the money,
[04:39:52.999 --> 04:39:53.259]  I think?
[04:40:12.639 --> 04:40:12.859]  I think?
[04:40:28.457 --> 04:40:30.859]  Then I think we have to worry about, yes, about civil unrest.
[04:40:30.919 --> 04:40:34.042]  It's also why it's important for every honest person to be armed.
[04:40:34.543 --> 04:40:38.306]  For every woman to be armed, for every man to be armed and know how to use their guns.
[04:40:40.108 --> 04:40:41.309]  That is the great object!
[04:40:41.489 --> 04:40:42.410]  That is the great object!
[04:40:43.191 --> 04:40:44.212]  Why did they pick Obama?
[04:40:44.232 --> 04:40:46.272]  Because they feel that he's better for them.
[04:40:46.293 --> 04:40:51.555]  He can fool people more effectively than Romney.
[04:40:51.595 --> 04:40:53.776]  That's one of the key things these guys have to do.
[04:40:53.896 --> 04:40:55.757]  They have to fool people for the plutocracy.
[04:40:56.237 --> 04:41:11.044]  So they feel, and I don't know what calculus goes into it entirely, but they feel that Obama can keep the game going longer than Romney might have been able to because people maybe saw Romney as himself a plutocrat.
[04:41:11.304 --> 04:41:12.205]  And they see Obama
[04:41:13.814 --> 04:41:17.437]  Obama was also a member of the power elite, of course.
[04:41:17.997 --> 04:41:24.563]  A lot of people see him as a regular guy who made good, whereas they think of Romney in a different way.
[04:41:24.963 --> 04:41:29.506]  So I think the fact that Romney was so wealthy and made his money
[04:41:31.094 --> 04:41:34.037]  Maybe a lot of it legitimately, maybe a lot of it not legitimately.
[04:41:34.077 --> 04:41:36.498]  Of course, Goldman Sachs was his big backer.
[04:41:36.619 --> 04:41:38.860]  But it plays into the class warfare narrative.
[04:41:38.880 --> 04:41:45.145]  By the way, Obama, they're now calling California for Barack Hussein Obama.
[04:41:45.505 --> 04:41:50.089]  He's got 244 electoral votes in the Puppet College versus 193 against Mitt Romney.
[04:41:52.691 --> 04:41:55.273]  I guess your prediction is coming true here right in front of us.
[04:41:55.713 --> 04:42:00.437]  I don't see much of a chance now if he gets, what's 44 to 70?
[04:42:01.558 --> 04:42:02.378]  How many is that?
[04:42:02.398 --> 04:42:03.940]  20 and then 6.
[04:42:05.341 --> 04:42:10.965]  26 more electoral votes and Barack Obama is in for 4 more years.
[04:42:11.565 --> 04:42:14.347]  What do you expect Obama to do with 4 more years?
[04:42:16.152 --> 04:42:17.753]  Well, I hope he's not going to bomb Iran.
[04:42:17.833 --> 04:42:23.999]  I mean, maybe that's the one thing that we might say good about him as versus Romney.
[04:42:24.279 --> 04:42:31.785]  He does seem more reluctant to bomb Iran, whereas Romney probably would have done that the first day he was in office.
[04:42:31.825 --> 04:42:33.907]  He's a very bloodthirsty guy.
[04:42:39.031 --> 04:42:46.136]  He knows to knock old ladies on the head militarily, not go start a fight with a junkyard dog.
[04:42:47.321 --> 04:42:54.226]  No, and also he's going to do more rewarding of Big Pharma, which is what Obamacare is.
[04:42:54.426 --> 04:43:01.611]  It's rewards to the big hospital complex, the big doctor complex, especially the big drug complex, who actually wrote Obamacare.
[04:43:01.951 --> 04:43:05.914]  The drug companies, or at least the parts of it that apply to the pharmaceutical industry.
[04:43:06.334 --> 04:43:07.255]  So he's going to do that.
[04:43:07.335 --> 04:43:09.016]  He's going to do more regulating.
[04:43:09.977 --> 04:43:17.082]  And by the way, every time, whatever their excuse is, whenever there are new regulations, some new government action, somebody is making
[04:43:19.053 --> 04:43:20.954]  You may not be able to see it right away who it is.
[04:43:20.974 --> 04:43:25.356]  They're not doing this for the public good or for the poor or whatever their excuses are.
[04:43:25.696 --> 04:43:35.841]  George Soros or the other oligarchs who are in back of Obama will do very well for the next four years, just as the oligarchs in back of Romney would have done very well if he'd been in office.
[04:43:36.261 --> 04:43:40.823]  But I think they all made the decision that it should be Obama, that they're better off with Obama.
[04:43:41.203 --> 04:43:42.944]  That's all they care about, of course.
[04:43:42.964 --> 04:43:44.285]  They couldn't care less about us except
[04:43:44.925 --> 04:43:49.388]  To fear us and to want to want to loot every dime from us that they possibly can.
[04:43:50.948 --> 04:43:54.490]  Well said, and that was answering my question about what we'll do in the next four years.
[04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:57.272]  I was now forgetting the one final question.
[04:43:58.012 --> 04:44:00.313]  Lew Rockwell, thank you so much for the time tonight.
[04:44:00.973 --> 04:44:06.957]  Of all the questions I've posed here, are there any other points you think are important to our audience out there watching?
[04:44:07.717 --> 04:44:11.339]  Alex, I just want to congratulate you on the show tonight and on everything else you do.
[04:44:12.159 --> 04:44:13.580]  You are indeed having a real impact.
[04:44:17.857 --> 04:44:18.918]  Well, Lou, we want to thank you.
[04:44:18.958 --> 04:44:19.879]  You're having a real impact.
[04:44:19.899 --> 04:44:21.061]  And I don't want to sound like I'm bragging.
[04:44:21.081 --> 04:44:21.982]  The show's getting bigger.
[04:44:22.022 --> 04:44:23.884]  It's actually humbling.
[04:44:24.826 --> 04:44:27.008]  Just little old me can have an effect like this.
[04:44:27.028 --> 04:44:29.171]  Imagine what others can do, like you've been doing.
[04:44:29.692 --> 04:44:31.914]  Ron Paul, I think the message is, get out there and
[04:44:33.816 --> 04:44:53.856]  Ron Paul said this in 2003 at a speech he gave in Austin, Texas that I videotaped and put in a film I made called Matrix of Evil, and he said, look, the big challenge in the next 10 to 15 years, and boy was he prescient, will be when they collapse things, and he said it will collapse because of derivatives and the dollar and all the rest of it, will the collectivist
[04:44:54.497 --> 04:45:04.405]  Be able to pose as saviors and act like they didn't do this and bring in total tyranny, or will we get the word out now so that people understand there's an alternative?
[04:45:04.425 --> 04:45:07.188]  And I'd like you to spend two minutes closing on that, Lou.
[04:45:07.208 --> 04:45:07.948]  I know it's late at night.
[04:45:07.968 --> 04:45:08.889]  We appreciate your time.
[04:45:08.909 --> 04:45:10.710]  But I mean, Ron Paul, I've really...
[04:45:11.391 --> 04:45:11.931]  I'm just saying this.
[04:45:11.971 --> 04:45:14.652]  I've studied politics, I've studied economics, I've studied history.
[04:45:14.912 --> 04:45:17.993]  People say, oh, that's that mean free market thing, you know, that'll do this and that.
[04:45:18.313 --> 04:45:28.075]  Look, you know, socialism and collectivism doesn't deliver, but, I mean, how did Ron Paul, I know you spoke about this too, so, you know, I mean, prescient, you know, ten years ago.
[04:45:28.095 --> 04:45:32.056]  You know, he is indeed prescient.
[04:45:32.076 --> 04:45:33.456]  He's also the great communicator.
[04:45:33.496 --> 04:45:34.517]  Forget Ronald Reagan.
[04:45:34.857 --> 04:45:36.357]  Ron Paul is the great communicator.
[04:45:36.897 --> 04:45:43.341]  And he's been able to communicate economic truths and historical truths, political truths, in a way that I've never seen before.
[04:45:43.961 --> 04:45:54.968]  But again, we do have the truth on our side, and all of us, you, of course, Ron, are doing such a great job of spreading this truth, and it's having a tremendous effect.
[04:45:55.468 --> 04:45:57.729]  So we're making the bad guys fear us.
[04:45:58.130 --> 04:45:58.610]  That's good.
[04:45:58.630 --> 04:46:00.491]  They're continuing with all their stuff.
[04:46:01.852 --> 04:46:09.857]  They're like the big army, with all their divisions marching into battle, like the British maybe in the time of George III.
[04:46:10.137 --> 04:46:29.307]  We're the guerrillas, but we don't have to have as many soldiers as the big guys do, because we're faster, we're smarter, maybe we're better sharpshooters with our ideas, and we're able to pinpoint what's wrong with the government, what's wrong with the current economic system, and why the
[04:46:29.787 --> 04:46:30.587]  Every market is best.
[04:46:30.707 --> 04:46:32.168]  I'll just leave with this one point.
[04:46:32.768 --> 04:46:42.171]  We've had this horrible gasoline shortage when people need gasoline so desperately for their cars and for their generators in New Jersey and in New York and Connecticut and so forth.
[04:46:42.591 --> 04:46:43.631]  So what did the government do?
[04:46:43.651 --> 04:46:45.772]  It actually caused a shortage.
[04:46:46.292 --> 04:46:50.554]  By introducing these so-called anti-price gouging laws.
[04:46:51.095 --> 04:46:59.659]  So at a time when gasoline is worth far more, and people of course are happy to pay far more for it, the government says you can't charge more, you have to charge the old price.
[04:47:00.700 --> 04:47:06.943]  And so that caused a shortage because the actual market price was much higher than what the price the gasoline stations were able to use.
[04:47:07.363 --> 04:47:08.684]  So they caused such havoc
[04:47:13.195 --> 04:47:18.865]  I noticed on MSNBC they were always talking about this disaster of Sandy shows why we need government.
[04:47:19.165 --> 04:47:26.698]  Well, what exactly has government done except of course loot people, strut around in uniforms telling us how great they are, telling us how important government is.
[04:47:35.182 --> 04:47:37.267]  You know, I'm glad you raised that point.
[04:47:47.236 --> 04:47:47.656]  Exactly.
[04:47:47.676 --> 04:47:50.517]  They say you can't, you know, have but three people in a car.
[04:47:50.577 --> 04:47:51.618]  You've got to do all these rules.
[04:47:51.638 --> 04:47:53.999]  That was one question I actually had written down.
[04:47:54.019 --> 04:47:54.899]  I never got to.
[04:47:55.299 --> 04:48:06.003]  Whether it's Katrina or Sandy, it's the churches and individuals that got ready that they admit that are keeping society going and government's not even anywhere to be seen.
[04:48:06.983 --> 04:48:08.704]  My listeners in Long Island,
[04:48:10.089 --> 04:48:20.634]  And Staten Island have called in, and I've seen it in the news, the cops, they've ordered them to be out there writing tickets for people running red lights that don't have power to them.
[04:48:21.015 --> 04:48:23.856]  I mean, that just shows the total disconnect of government.
[04:48:25.157 --> 04:48:35.322]  I noticed there was a case in Piedmont, Oklahoma today of a cop who gave a $2,500 ticket to a mother because her three-year-old little boy peed in his own front yard.
[04:48:35.342 --> 04:48:35.322]  $2,500.
[04:48:35.362 --> 04:48:36.643]  So, you know, these people are out of control.
[04:48:42.449 --> 04:48:42.649]  I don't
[04:49:02.637 --> 04:49:02.937]  I don't
[04:49:23.933 --> 04:49:24.333]  We're good.
[04:49:39.855 --> 04:49:40.055]  I don't
[04:50:04.991 --> 04:50:05.311]  We're good to go.
[04:50:26.004 --> 04:50:27.246]  Well, Lou, please don't thank me.
[04:50:27.326 --> 04:50:30.209]  Thank you for helping make myself and so many others up.
[04:50:30.229 --> 04:50:32.412]  We'll talk to you again as soon as you can join us.
[04:50:33.073 --> 04:50:38.099]  Thank you so much for the work you're doing over at lourockwell.com and the Von Mies Institute.
[04:50:38.279 --> 04:50:40.121]  And we'll be talking to Ron Paul on Friday.
[04:50:40.181 --> 04:50:40.902]  Thanks to your help.
[04:50:40.962 --> 04:50:41.483]  God bless you.
[04:50:42.224 --> 04:50:42.885]  Thank you, Alex.
[04:50:43.700 --> 04:50:45.061]  All right, there goes Lou Rockwell.
[04:50:45.241 --> 04:50:47.543]  A powerful 35-minute interview with him.
[04:50:47.563 --> 04:50:51.025]  And we've got more guests coming up.
[04:50:51.045 --> 04:50:56.389]  You know, we could go to Jakari Jackson here in about 10-15 minutes with an update on what's happening with the election.
[04:50:56.729 --> 04:51:00.631]  The Nomi Prins, who used to be a managing director at Goldman Sachs, is going to be joining us.
[04:51:01.332 --> 04:51:07.376]  And Dr. Webster Griffin Tarpley will also come on to talk about his take on the election.
[04:51:07.796 --> 04:51:10.518]  He was not a supporter of Obama four years ago.
[04:51:10.578 --> 04:51:11.379]  He is today.
[04:51:12.731 --> 04:51:14.332]  So I guess he's going to be pleased right now.
[04:51:14.352 --> 04:51:17.893]  As things are shaking up, more and more it looks like it's Obama.
[04:51:19.074 --> 04:51:21.355]  And I mean, who knows whether he really got elected or not.
[04:51:21.455 --> 04:51:22.755]  I mean, that's the problem with the fraud.
[04:51:22.775 --> 04:51:24.656]  I mean, I just, it doesn't even matter.
[04:51:24.676 --> 04:51:32.060]  I mean, quite frankly, I'm morally, just because he said he was pro-abortion and anti-gun, I had to like say, well, I don't like him.
[04:51:32.120 --> 04:51:34.741]  I'm not saying Romney's good, but Obama, really bad.
[04:51:35.761 --> 04:51:36.542]  But quite frankly,
[04:51:38.294 --> 04:51:41.377]  Obama's getting back in, at least we're not sure right now.
[04:51:42.297 --> 04:51:45.840]  But it's leaning in that direction, and so let's just get it as bad as it can get.
[04:51:45.900 --> 04:51:46.581]  Just come on.
[04:51:47.362 --> 04:51:48.102]  Just come on.
[04:51:48.162 --> 04:51:54.708]  Just shut down the coal plants, shut down the factories, shut it all down and hand out Obama phones to everybody.
[04:51:55.668 --> 04:51:58.271]  And Count Dracula will recede off for four years.
[04:52:00.996 --> 04:52:04.840]  Obama is now at 250, and Mitt Romney is at 203.
[04:52:05.441 --> 04:52:10.386]  Obama is, what, 20 votes away from a lock?
[04:52:10.827 --> 04:52:11.888]  It's 270, isn't it?
[04:52:13.810 --> 04:52:14.931]  Yeah, oh man.
[04:52:15.331 --> 04:52:15.732]  And you know what?
[04:52:15.752 --> 04:52:17.594]  If Mitt Romney was running right now, I'd be...
[04:52:18.977 --> 04:52:22.578]  It's like being told we're going to kill you with a hatchet or we're going to kill you with a sword.
[04:52:22.638 --> 04:52:24.139]  I mean, it's like, what's the difference?
[04:52:24.159 --> 04:52:25.339]  You're going to hack me up here.
[04:52:26.800 --> 04:52:27.980]  I don't like either one.
[04:52:28.520 --> 04:52:34.022]  It's just so amazing, though, because I knew John McCain was bad four years ago.
[04:52:34.042 --> 04:52:38.344]  And so I was like, well, Obama's going to be bad, but let's just see what he does.
[04:52:38.384 --> 04:52:44.666]  But now I know Obama and I hate him because I know he's a wicked puppet and I know Mitt Romney's a globalist as well.
[04:52:45.826 --> 04:52:47.306]  Oh boy, what are we going to do?
[04:52:47.366 --> 04:52:50.887]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[04:52:52.327 --> 04:52:53.968]  I'll try to go to more of your calls.
[04:52:54.308 --> 04:52:56.768]  Cody in Canada, then Joss in Wisconsin, and others.
[04:52:57.188 --> 04:52:59.689]  Cody, you're on the air with, well, yours truly.
[04:52:59.789 --> 04:53:00.129]  Go ahead.
[04:53:01.369 --> 04:53:02.310]  Hey Alex, how are you tonight?
[04:53:02.490 --> 04:53:03.330]  I'm doing good, brother.
[04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:05.350]  Oh, that's good.
[04:53:05.410 --> 04:53:11.251]  I've been a listener since 2007, and this is the first time I've called, so I'm pretty excited to ask you a question here.
[04:53:12.492 --> 04:53:13.472]  Well, you're on the air, sir.
[04:53:13.512 --> 04:53:13.812]  Thank you.
[04:53:14.984 --> 04:53:15.327]  All right.
[04:53:17.125 --> 04:53:20.928]  It's an election question pertaining to foreign policy.
[04:53:21.469 --> 04:53:27.013]  Now, I mean, I know the whole charade is nothing more than plastic-packaged crap, but bear with me here for a bit.
[04:53:28.315 --> 04:53:33.899]  I had listened to Romney's rhetoric concerning the Keystone Pipeline, and he says he supports it.
[04:53:34.980 --> 04:53:38.743]  Like, I mean, during Obama's presidency, he stopped the deal from going through.
[04:53:39.224 --> 04:53:45.289]  My question to you is, how will the Keystone Pipeline be affected depending on the election outcome?
[04:53:45.865 --> 04:53:51.170]  And do you believe that the oil from the oil sands up here would have a benefit to the U.S.
[04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:56.514]  in the long run, or would it be detrimental, and is it just another piece of the whole NAFTA, North American Union puzzle?
[04:53:57.695 --> 04:53:58.616]  Well, that's a great point.
[04:53:58.796 --> 04:54:03.300]  I mean, it's a very complex issue, and I've studied it quite a bit, and probably can't give you...
[04:54:04.173 --> 04:54:06.815]  A completely accurate answer because no one really knows.
[04:54:07.515 --> 04:54:09.196]  It's just one way, half a dozen another.
[04:54:10.617 --> 04:54:17.661]  There are tar sands and other alluvial deposits of oil and gas all over the United States.
[04:54:17.741 --> 04:54:19.722]  Canada obviously has richer deposits.
[04:54:20.766 --> 04:54:32.969]  But you'd have to talk to a petroleum geologist who specialize in the general canvassing of North America itself to come up with a proper prospectus on the overall analysis aggregate breakdown in those distillates.
[04:54:33.589 --> 04:54:42.711]  But I have looked at it and there's more oil overall in Canada than probably even in the United States of that type, probably General Crude itself.
[04:54:42.911 --> 04:54:47.412]  But that's not counting, that's contiguous U.S., not counting Alaska.
[04:54:48.492 --> 04:54:55.116]  So if you look at Alaska, it may have total more oil than even the gigantor Canada.
[04:54:55.136 --> 04:54:58.478]  And then of course the oceans up and around Canada are full of it.
[04:54:59.478 --> 04:55:08.704]  The best I can tell, they killed that Keystone Pipeline because George Soros and a railway he controls, this is like right out of Atlas Shrugged.
[04:55:09.944 --> 04:55:22.229]  It can now train all that out to tanker ships on the west coast of Canada to China and to Japan that desperately need it at a higher price.
[04:55:22.969 --> 04:55:27.731]  And that's kind of like 80% under agreements since the 70s of the oil coming out of Alaska.
[04:55:28.371 --> 04:55:30.592]  It doesn't go in the one pipeline of the west coast, that's 20%.
[04:55:30.812 --> 04:55:34.093]  80% ends up going to Asia.
[04:55:35.174 --> 04:55:37.855]  And so the issue with oil is there's actually plenty of oil.
[04:55:38.755 --> 04:55:39.615]  There's a lot of oil.
[04:55:40.756 --> 04:55:48.939]  And so the megacorporations, this has come out in oil company documents, even the Associated Press has reported on, are all about acting like environmentalists are stopping the development of it.
[04:55:49.779 --> 04:55:54.241]  Oh my gosh, Obama is now at 268 to Obama's 203.
[04:55:54.341 --> 04:55:58.583]  We are about to see Obama land slide the way this is going.
[04:55:59.363 --> 04:56:01.824]  And we're giving the numbers from AP, Reuters, you name it.
[04:56:04.065 --> 04:56:08.046]  This is like, well, like watching a fictional movie, but it still is exciting.
[04:56:09.046 --> 04:56:12.527]  But I hope that basic analysis gives you an answer.
[04:56:12.867 --> 04:56:14.008]  They don't want the U.S.
[04:56:14.068 --> 04:56:14.888]  energy independent.
[04:56:14.908 --> 04:56:18.709]  They want to use China and Japan to leverage our industry out.
[04:56:19.509 --> 04:56:22.110]  And so they're going to subsidize them with our oil and our gas.
[04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:23.090]  So does that answer your question?
[04:56:24.013 --> 04:56:32.518]  Yeah, that does, and that's the way I had seen it because, I mean, you've got the whole government dependency with citizens, citizens depending on government.
[04:56:33.699 --> 04:56:44.205]  My theory was that this whole North American Union NAFTA superhighway system that breaks up the free market is designed to make other countries dependent on each other.
[04:56:44.225 --> 04:56:47.127]  Well, no, I mean, that's what they admitted in the movie
[04:56:49.148 --> 04:56:50.949]  Oh, what's it called with James Caan?
[04:56:50.969 --> 04:56:51.730]  It's an excellent movie.
[04:56:51.770 --> 04:56:52.290]  Rollerball.
[04:56:52.690 --> 04:56:53.391]  In the 70s.
[04:56:53.431 --> 04:56:59.475]  That's about globalism, where they only let certain countries do certain things, so everybody's dependent on the megacorporations that control it.
[04:56:59.755 --> 04:57:00.496]  That's globalism.
[04:57:00.536 --> 04:57:01.336]  It's a monopoly.
[04:57:01.376 --> 04:57:02.197]  It's cronyism.
[04:57:02.637 --> 04:57:03.638]  It's the opposite of freedom.
[04:57:04.178 --> 04:57:06.820]  It's fascism at the top, socialism at the bottom.
[04:57:07.600 --> 04:57:07.981]  Thank you.
[04:57:08.101 --> 04:57:08.741]  Great points.
[04:57:09.081 --> 04:57:10.502]  Yeah, let's put those numbers back up.
[04:57:11.283 --> 04:57:15.926]  Looks like I can go to bed early tonight, ladies and gentlemen, unless this ends up being contested.
[04:57:15.946 --> 04:57:18.468]  Now, we've seen it called for Al Gore, and then it went to George Bush.
[04:57:19.549 --> 04:57:23.112]  It just means what puppet we'll have to stare at near the media, endlessly obsessed over.
[04:57:23.372 --> 04:57:24.533]  Somebody popped my ear a minute ago.
[04:57:24.553 --> 04:57:25.294]  Aaron, come on in here.
[04:57:26.195 --> 04:57:28.357]  Come on in here before we go to Jakari Jackson.
[04:57:29.258 --> 04:57:34.423]  After we take, I like to say Autobots roll out.
[04:57:34.443 --> 04:57:36.966]  I am Optimus Prime, the Cube.
[04:57:37.645 --> 04:57:39.726]  I'd almost like to say Jakardi Jackson.
[04:57:39.826 --> 04:57:40.527]  Coolest name ever.
[04:57:41.187 --> 04:57:43.548]  Aaron Dykes, you are in here with us right now.
[04:57:43.568 --> 04:57:48.571]  Yeah, Obama is at 268 to Romney's 203.
[04:57:48.611 --> 04:57:50.352]  270 to win.
[04:57:50.372 --> 04:57:54.294]  Unless this ends up getting contested and that's the Huffington Post.
[04:57:55.643 --> 04:57:56.164]  Calling that.
[04:57:56.184 --> 04:57:58.928]  Of course MSNBC already called it for Obama this morning.
[04:57:59.188 --> 04:58:01.071]  Let's go look at DrudgeReport.com.
[04:58:01.111 --> 04:58:04.135]  Let's see what that's saying from other news sources and let's go look at Fox News.
[04:58:04.155 --> 04:58:08.281]  They have given Obama Ohio but it's still 65% reporting and it's still pretty close.
[04:58:11.225 --> 04:58:13.786]  And how many goodies?
[04:58:14.246 --> 04:58:16.667]  How many electoral votes is Ohio?
[04:58:16.687 --> 04:58:16.667]  18.
[04:58:17.448 --> 04:58:19.309]  And so Florida is right on the line.
[04:58:19.329 --> 04:58:23.250]  They're somewhere between 90, not quite at 100% votes counted.
[04:58:23.310 --> 04:58:24.691]  How many juices does it have?
[04:58:24.711 --> 04:58:25.891]  Half a percentage, I want to say.
[04:58:26.292 --> 04:58:26.992]  Last time I checked.
[04:58:27.592 --> 04:58:29.994]  How many electoral does uh... Florida's 29.
[04:58:30.074 --> 04:58:33.216]  So will Florida be another recount as in past elections?
[04:58:33.296 --> 04:58:36.378]  Could Ohio, I mean you heard about all the mess with Ohio.
[04:58:36.398 --> 04:58:38.179]  I mean there's already lawsuits been filed.
[04:58:38.219 --> 04:58:41.381]  Man I hope there's not a recount because that's when the civil unrest is going to start.
[04:58:41.401 --> 04:58:48.325]  I agree they're already going crazy in the live feeds of the Obama supporters and you know people riot after ball games are won and lost.
[04:58:49.066 --> 04:58:50.887]  And so we don't know what could happen with that.
[04:58:52.554 --> 04:58:54.495]  But Ohio... So it isn't over yet?
[04:58:55.636 --> 04:59:00.838]  We already knew that Ohio... Will the Easter Bunny or will the Keebler Elf be elected?
[04:59:00.858 --> 04:59:06.921]  There's gonna be lawsuits over those provisional ballots, who's allowed to file absentees, military votes could come into play.
[04:59:06.941 --> 04:59:10.043]  Oh, they admittedly blocked almost all the military votes.
[04:59:10.303 --> 04:59:10.483]  Yeah.
[04:59:11.003 --> 04:59:13.265]  Uh, so it looks like it's going to be contested.
[04:59:13.285 --> 04:59:15.046]  I mean, I think that's where this has been going the whole time.
[04:59:15.386 --> 04:59:17.308]  You want to call it contested?
[04:59:17.328 --> 04:59:23.312]  They're going to claim Obama wins, but then it's going to be contested and somebody might try to steal it.
[04:59:23.532 --> 04:59:24.592]  I mean, you never know.
[04:59:24.733 --> 04:59:26.334]  And that's going to spell Riot City.
[04:59:26.594 --> 04:59:31.917]  I mean, like you said earlier, it's Karl Rove versus, you know, Rahm Emanuel type people and all the other people.
[04:59:31.937 --> 04:59:33.178]  Oh, I mean, it's disgusting.
[04:59:33.999 --> 04:59:37.021]  Were you there that time in the restaurant we had to leave and Karl Rove was in there?
[04:59:37.241 --> 04:59:37.421]  Yeah.
[04:59:37.621 --> 04:59:39.323]  Cackling like a demon right behind me?
[04:59:40.143 --> 04:59:42.824]  That was multiple encounters with Rove there.
[04:59:43.564 --> 04:59:45.485]  Oh yeah, you've been arrested for asking him a question.
[04:59:45.785 --> 04:59:49.046]  Yeah, so we thought it was probably a better idea to leave the restaurant with Rove.
[04:59:49.366 --> 04:59:51.007]  Oh yeah, because part of your probation is?
[04:59:51.187 --> 04:59:52.547]  Had that sulfur smell in there.
[04:59:53.328 --> 04:59:54.368]  To kind of quote Chavez.
[04:59:55.488 --> 04:59:56.629]  Oh yeah, Chavez will save us.
[04:59:58.189 --> 05:00:00.490]  See, people think of it as Chavez good, Karl Rove bad.
[05:00:00.510 --> 05:00:03.831]  How about Karl Rove bad, Chavez bad, Ahmadinejad bad?
[05:00:03.851 --> 05:00:05.592]  Yeah, they're all control freaks.
[05:00:07.513 --> 05:00:07.773]  Aaron,
[05:00:08.855 --> 05:00:12.640]  I am really sick of having to count how many pimples are on the butt of these politicians.
[05:00:13.781 --> 05:00:14.201]  I agree.
[05:00:14.261 --> 05:00:26.756]  I mean, I am sick of looking at them, I'm sick of hearing about them, and all they do is take our money and spend it and tell us how to live our lives, and then the globalists want to think that these two idiots, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, are actually running something.
[05:00:27.330 --> 05:00:39.483]  As bad as Romney has been, and I have a complete distaste for him, because both candidates are involved in shipping jobs to China, destroying our economy, and that alone is going to ruin our economy in the long term, if not in the short term.
[05:00:39.903 --> 05:00:43.047]  But that second term, they love these second term presidents.
[05:00:43.387 --> 05:00:44.368]  No, no, I agree.
[05:00:44.408 --> 05:00:48.713]  That's why I said, in a way, I said, I hope Romney gets elected.
[05:00:48.733 --> 05:00:49.694]  People are like, how dare you?
[05:00:50.014 --> 05:00:51.775]  Adore Sam, you right-wing extremist.
[05:00:51.795 --> 05:00:54.616]  We knew you were a filthy globalist from the start.
[05:00:54.636 --> 05:00:55.836]  He's an Israel operative.
[05:00:56.217 --> 05:00:59.298]  All I'm saying is, Obama is going to have free reign.
[05:00:59.338 --> 05:01:00.058]  Just get ready.
[05:01:01.599 --> 05:01:02.379]  Obama just won.
[05:01:03.400 --> 05:01:08.622]  According to Huffington Poop, George Soros, AOL, Time Warner, 275-203.
[05:01:10.282 --> 05:01:11.563]  What state sent him over the edge?
[05:01:19.414 --> 05:01:24.155]  Here, let's go to the almighty Drudge here instead of George Soros operation.
[05:01:24.175 --> 05:01:26.855]  Let's see what that has to say here tonight.
[05:01:29.896 --> 05:01:34.677]  And Romney 50, Obama 49% of the popular vote.
[05:01:34.737 --> 05:01:40.278]  That's what they're saying and that links through to AP breaking all of that down.
[05:01:40.298 --> 05:01:43.518]  We're going to get Jakari Jackson to break all this down.
[05:01:44.519 --> 05:01:46.539]  Republicans have kept control of the House.
[05:01:47.699 --> 05:01:49.500]  I'm always for division and gridlock.
[05:01:49.520 --> 05:01:50.521]  That's constitutional.
[05:01:50.701 --> 05:01:51.961]  We need to get things done.
[05:01:52.642 --> 05:01:59.826]  But then you got Boehner in there who will just... And they don't know about the Senate, but they're saying it looks like the Democrats are picking up seats there.
[05:01:59.906 --> 05:02:01.206]  Oh, that's absolutely horrible.
[05:02:01.366 --> 05:02:02.447]  They're coming after our guns.
[05:02:02.827 --> 05:02:04.068]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[05:02:04.608 --> 05:02:07.530]  Everybody wants to talk about how they're ready to get it on with the government.
[05:02:07.850 --> 05:02:11.252]  Obama said in that second debate, he wants to ban your handguns and rifles.
[05:02:12.012 --> 05:02:13.173]  I mean, ban him physically.
[05:02:13.193 --> 05:02:15.194]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[05:02:15.654 --> 05:02:17.276]  I mean, you didn't build that business, Aaron.
[05:02:17.376 --> 05:02:19.277]  I haven't sat here for 10 hours today on air.
[05:02:19.477 --> 05:02:21.338]  I mean, the government did this.
[05:02:21.398 --> 05:02:27.843]  I mean, there's like an Obama battery shoved up my, I mean, you know, my, well, I got a, it's a government battery.
[05:02:27.863 --> 05:02:30.624]  It's like Energizer, like the bunny, powered by Energizer.
[05:02:30.664 --> 05:02:31.385]  Is it Duracell?
[05:02:31.805 --> 05:02:32.866]  I'm powered by Obama.
[05:02:34.540 --> 05:02:35.120]  Everything is.
[05:02:35.160 --> 05:02:36.281]  I got Obama phone.
[05:02:36.301 --> 05:02:37.061]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[05:02:37.321 --> 05:02:41.523]  Well, you've used that metaphor since the time I started working here about changing the birdcage liner.
[05:02:41.543 --> 05:02:43.704]  They always want to change it out, you know, clean out the filth.
[05:02:44.044 --> 05:02:53.309]  Everybody's held their nose in this election, but if you go to an outdoor event where they've got porta-potties, you don't want to use them at the end of the event when they're all filled up and filthy.
[05:02:53.329 --> 05:02:53.889]  You want to use them...
[05:02:54.409 --> 05:03:00.253]  A little earlier on, even if neither one is particularly tasteful, excuse the metaphor, that's the problem with these two-term presidents.
[05:03:00.313 --> 05:03:01.573]  Completely unaccountable.
[05:03:01.914 --> 05:03:09.878]  We know his ambitions with guns, immigration, everything, his horrible agenda, and still... We think Obama's been pooping on us, get ready.
[05:03:09.898 --> 05:03:13.961]  I mean, I hate to... That's pretty much what the system is, though.
[05:03:14.341 --> 05:03:15.502]  Hey, the people want it!
[05:03:17.099 --> 05:03:18.580]  I mean, I believe Monsanto.
[05:03:18.640 --> 05:03:20.461]  No one wants to know there's GMO in their food.
[05:03:20.501 --> 05:03:21.342]  I think that's real.
[05:03:21.762 --> 05:03:24.264]  Have you heard the latest in California, what they did?
[05:03:24.704 --> 05:03:25.705]  I just found out about this.
[05:03:25.745 --> 05:03:34.791]  They sent out these flyers, a group for Democrats, which is a big deal in California because it's such a left-leaning state, saying vote no on 37.
[05:03:35.112 --> 05:03:38.994]  They made up a fake cop voters guide, told them to vote no on 37.
[05:03:39.275 --> 05:03:41.876]  Well, yeah, because, I mean, Riv Roosevelt said so.
[05:03:42.877 --> 05:03:44.798]  Roosevelt said so, jump into a meat grinder.
[05:03:45.118 --> 05:03:47.078]  And look, we have cops voter guide.
[05:03:47.659 --> 05:03:48.439]  Oh, the cops.
[05:03:48.479 --> 05:03:51.680]  They got caught with this.
[05:03:51.900 --> 05:03:53.441]  Where's the document cam shot at?
[05:03:53.501 --> 05:03:54.641]  Where do I put these?
[05:03:54.901 --> 05:03:55.781]  Here's the headline for that.
[05:03:55.801 --> 05:03:56.582]  Where's the camera aim?
[05:03:56.602 --> 05:03:57.282]  Just let me know, guys.
[05:03:59.147 --> 05:03:59.867]  Okay, here it is.
[05:03:59.887 --> 05:04:00.267]  Here you go.
[05:04:00.287 --> 05:04:01.108]  You just aim over here.
[05:04:01.128 --> 05:04:02.088]  There you go.
[05:04:02.568 --> 05:04:03.748]  Yeah, if you want to read that headline.
[05:04:03.788 --> 05:04:10.050]  They made up at least four front groups who mailed out flyers saying, vote no on Prop 37 if you support the cops.
[05:04:10.090 --> 05:04:14.992]  No, no, they ended up using fake FDA seals, which I see the FDA, that means it's a deadly poison.
[05:04:15.152 --> 05:04:19.233]  But I mean, you know, they're saying the Food and Drug Administration says you don't want things labeled.
[05:04:19.373 --> 05:04:23.855]  And then they attacked the people who wanted labeling for complaining about it and said they were the crazy ones.
[05:04:24.335 --> 05:04:25.636]  Well, all you gotta do is say crazy.
[05:04:25.696 --> 05:04:32.519]  I mean, literally, next time somebody robs a bank, they just walk in and say, give me the money, and they say, you don't really want to do this robbery, go, conspiracy theory!
[05:04:32.960 --> 05:04:42.525]  And if they shoot him, and the cops show up, you killed somebody, go, conspiracy theory, and the cops will all kneel, and everyone will just say nothing happened.
[05:04:43.485 --> 05:04:51.670]  Like I told Dr. Roberts, they could nuke the U.S., and the media could just announce it wasn't an attack, and as cities, like, blow up and burn, they could just say it wasn't true.
[05:04:52.745 --> 05:04:56.387]  For all the zombies and morons, though, Alex, we do have to look on the positive side.
[05:04:56.687 --> 05:04:58.448]  We've talked about voting with your dollars.
[05:04:58.788 --> 05:05:00.929]  We've seen the groundswell of grassroots support.
[05:05:00.970 --> 05:05:03.531]  The system has seen an awakening.
[05:05:03.571 --> 05:05:06.573]  Now, they've stopped it politically because they own that system.
[05:05:06.613 --> 05:05:07.233]  They've jammed it.
[05:05:07.273 --> 05:05:10.335]  I mean, I studied in college in political science courses how
[05:05:11.075 --> 05:05:13.998]  The Democrats, the Republicans make the party rules.
[05:05:14.018 --> 05:05:15.540]  That's why you never get a third party.
[05:05:15.600 --> 05:05:17.663]  Good, bad, or indifferent if you like liberty.
[05:05:17.683 --> 05:05:23.569]  No, that's why they're setting up FEMA camps, drones, helicopters, checkpoints, torture, secret arrests, NSA spy hubs.
[05:05:23.950 --> 05:05:25.371]  It's because they know we're awake.
[05:05:26.292 --> 05:05:29.514]  The problem is you've got people endorsing fraudulent checks.
[05:05:29.574 --> 05:05:33.856]  Obama now has an endorsed fraudulent blank check to go all the way to the goal line.
[05:05:34.216 --> 05:05:39.278]  I mean, yeah, Romney would have been a little bit of gridlock even though they represent the same basic evil system.
[05:05:39.518 --> 05:05:41.199]  That's why Romney would be new.
[05:05:41.239 --> 05:05:43.540]  He'd have to rearrange stuff.
[05:05:43.600 --> 05:05:48.302]  The Democrats would certainly not like torture and secret arrest and things that they love so much.
[05:05:48.322 --> 05:05:53.125]  He's got to get up there and give a speech about why he wants to do these things and why it's okay under these circumstances.
[05:05:54.185 --> 05:05:55.066]  You've already heard from him.
[05:05:55.086 --> 05:05:56.388]  He doesn't really have to say anything.
[05:05:56.888 --> 05:06:02.715]  Hey, all I can say is, you know, all the idiot Democrats and people are going to get what they want, so, you know.
[05:06:02.995 --> 05:06:04.376]  It's kind of a sick joke, man.
[05:06:05.898 --> 05:06:13.887]  But on that Prop 37 issue, that's how afraid they were of just labeling foods to let people, consumers in this country, know what's in foods.
[05:06:14.167 --> 05:06:15.108]  I'll just tell you this.
[05:06:15.428 --> 05:06:17.370]  Well, I think extremists should know what's in their food.
[05:06:17.970 --> 05:06:18.951]  Listen, I just know this.
[05:06:18.991 --> 05:06:22.294]  My gut told me Obama was the elite's choice, and he was going to be much worse.
[05:06:22.334 --> 05:06:24.295]  I've said that as bad as Romney is.
[05:06:24.476 --> 05:06:25.236]  Look out, folks.
[05:06:25.316 --> 05:06:25.737]  Get ready.
[05:06:26.037 --> 05:06:27.278]  Now, that's the Huffington Post.
[05:06:27.338 --> 05:06:30.400]  I mean, let's go see the opposite of that.
[05:06:31.081 --> 05:06:34.284]  Let's go see Fox News, and we'll go to Jakari Jackson and our next guest.
[05:06:35.100 --> 05:06:44.226]  Now let's go to Fox News and give you the numbers off of what they're saying, which they just grab out of the air as well from the states reporting it and the new name of Voter News Services.
[05:06:44.746 --> 05:06:47.468]  And they got Obama at 275-203.
[05:06:48.588 --> 05:06:54.372]  So they're going with exactly, if you guys will punch my computer up, I can actually show people what's going on in here.
[05:06:54.732 --> 05:07:00.455]  There's a feed to my computer that's absolutely paramount that people will be able to get that.
[05:07:00.475 --> 05:07:00.876]  There you go.
[05:07:01.798 --> 05:07:02.618]  So there you go.
[05:07:02.718 --> 05:07:04.939]  Four more years, Fox News is calling it.
[05:07:05.359 --> 05:07:08.001]  Barack Obama re-elected Supreme Leader.
[05:07:11.602 --> 05:07:23.587]  And we got David Ortiz live at the Convention Center with the Democrats in a orgasmic glee at their free goodies and all the cancer viruses they'll get and all the free abortions and everything else.
[05:07:23.607 --> 05:07:27.388]  So let's go to Jakari Jackson to bring us into that and then talk to David Ortiz.
[05:07:27.428 --> 05:07:30.690]  Jakari Jackson in the Infowars Nightly News Command Center.
[05:07:30.830 --> 05:07:31.290]  Stay with us.
[05:07:35.094 --> 05:07:37.895]  Hello Jakari, we're all very pleased here.
[05:07:38.235 --> 05:07:44.077]  Obama is now officially, because Carl Rose Fox News has declared him emperor for four more years.
[05:07:44.577 --> 05:07:45.537]  I know I feel safer.
[05:07:46.337 --> 05:07:47.538]  Yeah, four more years.
[05:07:47.578 --> 05:07:51.359]  He's coming for my guns and a lot of other stuff.
[05:07:52.059 --> 05:07:53.920]  That's pretty much what I thought it was going to be.
[05:07:54.260 --> 05:07:55.521]  I thought it was going to be Obama.
[05:07:55.561 --> 05:07:59.402]  I didn't think Romney was a real good guy to convince that
[05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:01.889]  Oh God, look at these idiots.
[05:08:25.200 --> 05:08:26.861]  How are you guys feeling right now?
[05:08:27.261 --> 05:08:28.042]  Unbelievable.
[05:08:28.282 --> 05:08:30.943]  It is amazing that we finally won what we were supposed to win.
[05:08:31.624 --> 05:08:32.865]  Did you think you were going to win tonight?
[05:08:33.785 --> 05:08:35.506]  You know, I knew Obama would win.
[05:08:35.806 --> 05:08:36.987]  I absolutely knew it.
[05:08:37.127 --> 05:08:44.431]  And I just want you to know that I listen to Alex Jones on AM radio whenever I have the opportunity driving around.
[05:08:45.292 --> 05:08:47.733]  And I knew Obama would win.
[05:08:47.753 --> 05:08:52.456]  I don't think it was a conspiracy, but I knew he would win.
[05:08:52.816 --> 05:08:54.097]  Take extra vaccines, lady.
[05:08:57.534 --> 05:09:00.686]  I don't listen to Alex Jones all the time, but I still agree with her all the way.
[05:09:03.306 --> 05:09:06.707]  Oh my god, I'm being mean to him and their listeners.
[05:09:07.467 --> 05:09:09.068]  I guess we'll all teleprompter free again.
[05:09:09.128 --> 05:09:11.369]  Alex, Dan, and David at the same time.
[05:09:11.629 --> 05:09:13.369]  I'm sorry, hey, hold on, hold on, David.
[05:09:13.629 --> 05:09:14.810]  Talk to more of these idiots.
[05:09:14.830 --> 05:09:17.651]  Yeah, Jakari, I wanna, I'm gonna like Mystery Science Theater.
[05:09:17.871 --> 05:09:20.752]  No, I'd say this about Republicans too, but I mean, she's a nice lady.
[05:09:21.432 --> 05:09:26.093]  Yeah, if you, if you can catch anybody, but I'll just talk in the meantime so you can catch them.
[05:09:26.133 --> 05:09:27.854]  You said the conventions, that looks like the Driscoll.
[05:09:31.049 --> 05:09:31.709]  Anyone you want me to go to?
[05:09:31.729 --> 05:09:32.330]  Go ahead, go.
[05:09:32.410 --> 05:09:33.470]  You're live, my friend.
[05:09:33.890 --> 05:09:35.551]  Okay, uh, who am I speaking with?
[05:09:35.851 --> 05:09:36.852]  Uh, Donald Matthews.
[05:09:37.572 --> 05:09:38.992]  Alright, Donald, how are you feeling right now, buddy?
[05:09:39.012 --> 05:09:39.873]  Oh, I'm feeling great.
[05:09:40.253 --> 05:09:41.073]  I'm feeling great.
[05:09:41.093 --> 05:09:41.874]  Make history again.
[05:09:42.874 --> 05:09:43.354]  Oh, man.
[05:09:43.434 --> 05:09:44.055]  Oh, yeah.
[05:09:44.135 --> 05:09:48.857]  Oh, I'm feeling so good right now.
[05:09:48.937 --> 05:09:50.798]  It was close.
[05:09:50.858 --> 05:09:56.500]  It was real close, but he took care of business, so now we won again.
[05:09:56.540 --> 05:09:57.481]  Another four more years.
[05:09:57.701 --> 05:09:58.481]  We won again.
[05:09:58.501 --> 05:09:59.902]  It's like when the football team wins.
[05:09:59.942 --> 05:10:00.462]  We won.
[05:10:02.571 --> 05:10:03.412]  He's more to the people.
[05:10:04.153 --> 05:10:09.838]  He's more to the people that sit there and help us out, the middle class, people that don't have all that extra money.
[05:10:10.318 --> 05:10:16.404]  He's more to sit there and help the lower class people out, and not just worry about everybody else that got millions of dollars.
[05:10:16.684 --> 05:10:18.626]  So he want to go ahead and help the other people out.
[05:10:18.646 --> 05:10:20.328]  Let me play devil's advocate.
[05:10:20.368 --> 05:10:24.051]  What do you say to those people that say, oh, come on, he couldn't revive the economy, he said he would?
[05:10:24.772 --> 05:10:25.533]  Well, you know what I mean?
[05:10:26.567 --> 05:10:29.528]  You gotta understand, he only had four years to try to get a chance to do that.
[05:10:30.288 --> 05:10:33.989]  Compared to, like, those first eight years before he got to office.
[05:10:34.849 --> 05:10:36.929]  It was a lot of stuff he had to take care of.
[05:10:37.169 --> 05:10:39.850]  A lot of debris out there for him to go ahead and try to handle.
[05:10:40.290 --> 05:10:42.150]  But he did the best job he could.
[05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:46.271]  Now he got another four years to go, so he can go ahead and take care of that.
[05:10:46.711 --> 05:10:47.292]  One more thing.
[05:10:47.392 --> 05:10:51.273]  What's the first issue you'd like to see him address in his second term?
[05:10:52.513 --> 05:10:53.313]  The issues with
[05:10:54.170 --> 05:10:54.590]  Healthcare.
[05:10:54.770 --> 05:10:58.712]  Just go ahead and keep the healthcare for people that can't afford it.
[05:10:59.252 --> 05:11:01.553]  To help them out to where they can go ahead and afford it.
[05:11:01.733 --> 05:11:03.854]  That's what makes a lot of people in Louisiana.
[05:11:03.874 --> 05:11:09.056]  If you can't take care of your health, then I hope, I hope the economy, especially the economy makes it.
[05:11:15.632 --> 05:11:16.953]  See, that guy's a nice guy.
[05:11:17.374 --> 05:11:18.675]  Just like that lady earlier.
[05:11:18.715 --> 05:11:19.595]  They're nice people.
[05:11:19.615 --> 05:11:20.656]  They're gullible as hell.
[05:11:20.696 --> 05:11:22.798]  They have no idea what's happening to them.
[05:11:22.938 --> 05:11:25.941]  Oh yeah, he's gonna boost it up to the foreign banks.
[05:11:25.981 --> 05:11:27.803]  He's helping those billionaires, buddy.
[05:11:27.843 --> 05:11:28.503]  Well, I'm sorry to say.
[05:11:28.523 --> 05:11:37.331]  You got another four years to go ahead and try to, you know, step the game up.
[05:11:41.836 --> 05:11:43.597]  Taking the trophy home, thank you.
[05:11:44.057 --> 05:11:53.081]  Hey, tell Ortiz, guys, tell Ortiz to go show the conclave of Democrats.
[05:11:56.103 --> 05:11:57.843]  Well, I guess this is a good time.
[05:11:57.883 --> 05:11:59.744]  No, no, no, no, no, we're going to keep going.
[05:11:59.764 --> 05:12:00.364]  This is good.
[05:12:00.665 --> 05:12:05.867]  Tell him to march in and show the hive of minions celebrating.
[05:12:06.187 --> 05:12:08.068]  Tell him to give us some general shots.
[05:12:08.248 --> 05:12:09.689]  Okay, you guys are going to have to go mobile.
[05:12:10.129 --> 05:12:11.610]  Alex wants you to move around.
[05:12:11.650 --> 05:12:13.471]  If your camera gets a little off-center, that's okay.
[05:12:13.491 --> 05:12:16.092]  But just take a look around and show us what's going on over there.
[05:12:16.133 --> 05:12:19.314]  Yeah, yeah, show us the celebrating.
[05:12:19.354 --> 05:12:20.715]  Show us the celebrations here.
[05:12:20.735 --> 05:12:22.696]  The Obama phone orgy.
[05:12:23.337 --> 05:12:26.478]  We're about to go mobile here, folks.
[05:12:26.498 --> 05:12:27.299]  Teleprompter free.
[05:12:28.860 --> 05:12:29.720]  Okay, so anyway...
[05:12:31.974 --> 05:12:33.256]  The party is upstairs.
[05:12:33.296 --> 05:12:37.101]  We actually had to move because it was like a Rolling Stones concert.
[05:12:37.121 --> 05:12:38.643]  I mean, there was like 2,000 people.
[05:12:38.663 --> 05:12:40.705]  Hey, David, is there any way you can get upstairs?
[05:12:40.725 --> 05:12:41.506]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:12:41.566 --> 05:12:42.748]  That's the Driscoll, isn't it?
[05:12:42.788 --> 05:12:43.749]  We can go upstairs.
[05:12:43.789 --> 05:12:45.271]  Okay, Alex wants you to go upstairs.
[05:12:45.291 --> 05:12:46.272]  Hey, are you at the Driscoll?
[05:12:46.292 --> 05:12:47.013]  Ask him if he's at the Driscoll.
[05:12:47.033 --> 05:12:48.075]  Okay, that'll take a minute, though.
[05:12:48.415 --> 05:12:48.976]  Are you gonna go live?
[05:12:52.068 --> 05:12:53.149]  Alex, he's at the Driscoll.
[05:12:53.430 --> 05:12:54.391]  Okay, he's at the Driscoll.
[05:12:54.451 --> 05:12:55.092]  Okay, fine.
[05:12:55.372 --> 05:12:59.636]  Yeah, tell him to go up to the bar and I want to see the worship and the minionship.
[05:12:59.937 --> 05:13:01.118]  Just walk up with the camera.
[05:13:01.138 --> 05:13:02.419]  I don't care how shaky it is.
[05:13:02.820 --> 05:13:06.464]  I want to see the celebration of our God, Barack Obama.
[05:13:08.726 --> 05:13:10.187]  Go up to the bar upstairs.
[05:13:10.907 --> 05:13:16.730]  If your camera gets shaky, that's okay, but go now and we'll cut to some articles or whatever we have to do and you just let us know.
[05:13:16.750 --> 05:13:18.090]  No, no, I want to see you going up the stairs.
[05:13:18.110 --> 05:13:19.391]  Okay, well, hey, live, live.
[05:13:19.451 --> 05:13:21.512]  Live, roll, roll, roll.
[05:13:21.572 --> 05:13:23.233]  If we can go back to that shot, guys.
[05:13:23.713 --> 05:13:25.974]  I'm feeling like I had a victory right now.
[05:13:26.794 --> 05:13:28.455]  All right, so let's go.
[05:13:28.495 --> 05:13:29.696]  Now, now, please guys.
[05:13:30.036 --> 05:13:30.936]  All right, we're live.
[05:13:31.597 --> 05:13:32.437]  Okay, we're live.
[05:13:32.877 --> 05:13:33.477]  I'm loving this.
[05:13:33.497 --> 05:13:34.558]  This technology is incredible.
[05:13:34.578 --> 05:13:36.839]  Right now, we're going to go upstairs to the bar.
[05:13:38.314 --> 05:13:45.180]  We're going to see Obamanoids having a mindless, I mean look at them, they're prancing and they're absolutely having a great time.
[05:13:45.200 --> 05:13:47.382]  Oh they're winners, oh yes.
[05:13:48.643 --> 05:13:51.065]  I mean these people literally have chicken necks.
[05:13:51.566 --> 05:13:57.030]  Alex, I think they're trying to gather their gear, but as fast as you can guys.
[05:13:58.109 --> 05:14:00.270]  It's okay, they just picked the whole camera up.
[05:14:00.290 --> 05:14:01.951]  So you're trying to go up right now to the bar?
[05:14:02.291 --> 05:14:03.732]  Yes, yes, if you can, David.
[05:14:03.812 --> 05:14:04.592]  Here we go, here we go.
[05:14:04.612 --> 05:14:05.892]  There we go, we're going up.
[05:14:06.253 --> 05:14:07.973]  We're gonna see a celebration.
[05:14:08.414 --> 05:14:11.695]  Obama for more years, yeah!
[05:14:11.955 --> 05:14:13.456]  David, don't be afraid to help him out.
[05:14:14.916 --> 05:14:16.017]  We're on live right now.
[05:14:17.153 --> 05:14:19.275]  Oh my gosh, this is, I'm entering heaven right now.
[05:14:19.535 --> 05:14:23.558]  This is like when you enter Valhalla, or if you're Al Qaeda and blow yourself up, you get 40 virgins.
[05:14:24.119 --> 05:14:28.002]  Well, when you vote for Obama, you get to go, and just, this is a celebration.
[05:14:29.183 --> 05:14:29.823]  Nothing vulgar.
[05:14:31.285 --> 05:14:32.266]  Nothing vulgar.
[05:14:32.486 --> 05:14:33.687]  Money doesn't buy an election.
[05:14:33.727 --> 05:14:36.449]  Very important, this guy.
[05:14:36.469 --> 05:14:37.530]  Money doesn't buy an election.
[05:14:37.790 --> 05:14:38.190]  Alright.
[05:14:38.210 --> 05:14:39.992]  Okay, this is, this is awesome.
[05:14:40.112 --> 05:14:41.033]  Okay, this is rough.
[05:14:41.073 --> 05:14:42.174]  We're teleprompter free.
[05:14:42.194 --> 05:14:45.877]  They're literally, oh my gosh, they're coming down all at once.
[05:14:46.892 --> 05:14:48.313]  They're all getting Obama phones.
[05:14:48.333 --> 05:14:52.215]  Okay, we're almost there.
[05:14:52.696 --> 05:14:53.056]  Okay.
[05:14:54.196 --> 05:14:56.918]  They all are loving their government eugenics healthcare.
[05:14:56.938 --> 05:15:00.400]  Now, this is basically... It's a huge room.
[05:15:00.440 --> 05:15:02.161]  It's about two to three thousand people.
[05:15:04.443 --> 05:15:06.964]  Milling around, mindlessly celebrating communism.
[05:15:06.984 --> 05:15:07.845]  Can you hear me, Jaakari?
[05:15:07.885 --> 05:15:08.605]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[05:15:08.645 --> 05:15:08.985]  I can hear you.
[05:15:09.005 --> 05:15:09.326]  Go ahead.
[05:15:10.286 --> 05:15:10.586]  Yeah.
[05:15:11.107 --> 05:15:13.248]  Let's, uh... Hey, Darren, can we pan around the room?
[05:15:13.268 --> 05:15:14.329]  Let's just park it right there.
[05:15:14.349 --> 05:15:15.149]  Yeah, this is awesome.
[05:15:17.665 --> 05:15:21.727]  Yes, David, also if you can grab anybody and get a comment, that'd be great.
[05:15:21.747 --> 05:15:23.487]  Anybody want to be on camera and talk about Obama?
[05:15:24.848 --> 05:15:26.608]  Anybody want to be on camera and talk about Obama?
[05:15:27.909 --> 05:15:29.389]  Give us one second here.
[05:15:29.470 --> 05:15:31.170]  Okay, go ahead and get your camera pan.
[05:15:34.772 --> 05:15:37.453]  David Ortiz live at the Driscoll Hotel.
[05:15:39.994 --> 05:15:45.496]  Hold on, we're still panning around.
[05:15:45.536 --> 05:15:46.236]  Okay, that's alright.
[05:15:48.328 --> 05:15:49.649]  Now they're shying away.
[05:15:49.889 --> 05:15:51.009]  Hold on one second.
[05:15:53.111 --> 05:15:55.592]  Yes, he will reign for another four years.
[05:15:56.612 --> 05:15:58.853]  Four more years of Obama.
[05:15:59.974 --> 05:16:02.235]  So, how are you feeling right now?
[05:16:03.156 --> 05:16:03.676]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[05:16:04.316 --> 05:16:05.177]  I'm feeling pretty good.
[05:16:05.717 --> 05:16:07.358]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, great election.
[05:16:07.378 --> 05:16:08.098]  I'm from Chicago.
[05:16:08.138 --> 05:16:09.319]  I wish I was back home right now.
[05:16:09.339 --> 05:16:10.940]  I was there in 08 when it happened.
[05:16:11.000 --> 05:16:12.801]  It'd be great to be back there right now.
[05:16:13.401 --> 05:16:14.862]  Okay, why are you so happy?
[05:16:15.532 --> 05:16:16.313]  I just love it.
[05:16:16.373 --> 05:16:20.835]  Obama launched all these drone attacks and increased the torture and bombed all these countries.
[05:16:21.076 --> 05:16:22.116]  You know, man, it's a peace.
[05:16:22.296 --> 05:16:23.937]  I'm feeling really good right now.
[05:16:23.977 --> 05:16:25.979]  Goldman Sachs runs both of them.
[05:16:25.999 --> 05:16:29.061]  You know, I'm going to take more shots, drink more fluoride.
[05:16:29.081 --> 05:16:30.501]  That's exactly what I want to hear.
[05:16:30.521 --> 05:16:37.246]  I'd love to see him go on to address healthcare because he's been working so hard on that.
[05:16:37.926 --> 05:16:42.249]  I'm glad that he won because I'm tired of the flip-flopping in politics.
[05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:44.851]  Are you happy with his first four years?
[05:16:44.871 --> 05:16:46.172]  What he accomplished in his first four years?
[05:16:46.192 --> 05:16:46.612]  Some of it.
[05:16:47.672 --> 05:16:49.313]  I mean I'm very bipartisan.
[05:17:09.799 --> 05:17:12.161]  Um, I prefer Obama to Romney.
[05:17:12.781 --> 05:17:16.443]  But, yeah, most of what he's done I was very happy with.
[05:17:16.803 --> 05:17:17.764]  Like the NDAA?
[05:17:17.824 --> 05:17:18.704]  Does he like the NDAA?
[05:17:18.884 --> 05:17:21.126]  Yeah, ask him about that!
[05:17:21.206 --> 05:17:22.487]  NDAA or these?
[05:17:23.307 --> 05:17:25.148]  There are a few things that are questionable to me.
[05:17:25.168 --> 05:17:31.252]  Um, I have my own hesitations about the whole Osama Bin Laden murder.
[05:17:31.272 --> 05:17:32.713]  Because, I mean, there was no body.
[05:17:32.833 --> 05:17:33.353]  Elaborate.
[05:17:33.393 --> 05:17:33.853]  Elaborate.
[05:17:33.873 --> 05:17:34.294]  Please.
[05:17:34.334 --> 05:17:35.214]  Elaborate on that.
[05:17:36.155 --> 05:17:36.935]  I'd rather not.
[05:17:37.155 --> 05:17:38.456]  I don't want to sound like a conspiracy.
[05:17:39.088 --> 05:17:43.051]  Oh my god, so he's a smart guy and still likes Obama!
[05:17:43.091 --> 05:17:47.574]  We actually believe a lot of that, you know, of that philosophy.
[05:17:48.395 --> 05:17:50.956]  There's a lot of stuff that they don't tell you.
[05:17:50.976 --> 05:17:52.317]  Such as?
[05:17:53.138 --> 05:17:56.160]  I mean, there's so many things.
[05:17:56.320 --> 05:18:01.383]  There's people that believe that George Bush was responsible for the 9-11 attacks and stupid shit like that.
[05:18:01.423 --> 05:18:05.106]  I don't personally believe that, but I mean... We're live right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:18:05.526 --> 05:18:07.908]  Besides word of mouth that we got Osama,
[05:18:08.906 --> 05:18:11.807]  I mean, that's all I'm going to... I'm going to leave it at that.
[05:18:11.827 --> 05:18:13.747]  Okay, one last thing and then I'll let you go.
[05:18:14.207 --> 05:18:19.208]  What do you think about the fact that President Obama supports the NDAA bill?
[05:18:19.228 --> 05:18:20.508]  Do you know what that is, NDAA?
[05:18:20.828 --> 05:18:24.009]  That's basically a bill that will enable him... Not to spy, right?
[05:18:24.629 --> 05:18:34.691]  Well, that's a Patriot Act, but the NDAA bill, and Mitt Romney supported it also, it's a bill that will enable the President to throw an American in jail for as long as they want if they deem you a terrorist.
[05:18:34.711 --> 05:18:35.111]  No trial.
[05:18:38.450 --> 05:18:44.352]  I kind of think that's bullshit, but I mean, it's a lesser of two evils of that if they both support- Once again, we're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:18:45.272 --> 05:18:52.055]  I mean, because under that kind of a bill, you can- Ask him if he knows about cancer viruses and the vaccines and the government wants to murder him.
[05:18:52.215 --> 05:18:59.117]  If they deem it that way- Hey, David, since he's from Chicago, ask him about students eating rodent droppings in the Chicago schools.
[05:18:59.838 --> 05:19:00.518]  Yeah, ask him about-
[05:19:02.606 --> 05:19:05.647]  Ask him about students eating, since he's concerned about health care.
[05:19:05.947 --> 05:19:12.490]  Ask him about students in Chicago eating rodent droppings, because they keep failing their lunchroom evaluations.
[05:19:12.830 --> 05:19:15.231]  Eating rodent droppings?
[05:19:17.272 --> 05:19:20.253]  You know, you're for health care, obviously President Barack Obama is for health care.
[05:19:20.593 --> 05:19:23.254]  In Chicago, there was a news report that came out that said
[05:19:25.339 --> 05:19:27.580]  And schools didn't want to eat their vegetables.
[05:19:28.721 --> 05:19:31.583]  So they ate rodents.
[05:19:31.843 --> 05:19:33.284]  They were eating rodent droppings.
[05:19:33.304 --> 05:19:35.065]  What do you think about that?
[05:19:35.085 --> 05:19:40.128]  Um, I mean, I can't, I can't comment on children, man.
[05:19:42.269 --> 05:19:43.850]  Children do what children do.
[05:19:43.890 --> 05:19:44.771]  No, no, no.
[05:19:44.791 --> 05:19:48.213]  The rats got in the food and dropped their droppings, man.
[05:19:48.233 --> 05:19:50.494]  It's not my place to talk about that.
[05:19:51.582 --> 05:19:52.182]  I understand.
[05:19:52.602 --> 05:19:53.282]  What were you saying?
[05:19:53.822 --> 05:19:55.163]  Oh, no, that's fine, that's fine.
[05:19:55.323 --> 05:19:57.223]  Let the gentleman go.
[05:19:57.263 --> 05:19:57.943]  Thank you so much.
[05:19:58.863 --> 05:20:00.604]  All right, can you guys get any more shots?
[05:20:01.824 --> 05:20:06.265]  Yeah, give us a pan of the celebrating Minions.
[05:20:06.285 --> 05:20:07.125]  Who's that?
[05:20:07.325 --> 05:20:08.545]  Right behind you.
[05:20:08.585 --> 05:20:09.166]  Look, turn around.
[05:20:09.326 --> 05:20:10.066]  David, turn around.
[05:20:10.326 --> 05:20:11.886]  Captain America, can I speak to you?
[05:20:12.786 --> 05:20:12.926]  Yes.
[05:20:12.946 --> 05:20:13.606]  Hold on, he's here.
[05:20:13.646 --> 05:20:13.987]  Okay.
[05:20:14.167 --> 05:20:16.207]  We're going to go know me friends here in a minute.
[05:20:16.547 --> 05:20:17.187]  I'm elated.
[05:20:17.407 --> 05:20:19.188]  I'm excited for the next four years.
[05:20:21.989 --> 05:20:24.730]  I'm so glad Obama won, proving that it's not just a fad.
[05:20:24.990 --> 05:20:28.830]  He was the actual president that captured the hearts of the American people.
[05:20:29.971 --> 05:20:31.511]  So he's a great president.
[05:20:31.571 --> 05:20:32.751]  Excellent president.
[05:20:32.791 --> 05:20:33.851]  Excellent president.
[05:20:35.092 --> 05:20:36.332]  I'm so happy right now.
[05:20:36.352 --> 05:20:37.412]  I'm so happy right now.
[05:20:37.732 --> 05:20:39.693]  I'm so glad to get the inauguration.
[05:20:39.773 --> 05:20:41.893]  I'm so glad to see him become president.
[05:20:42.193 --> 05:20:44.234]  Now, he's gonna do it again.
[05:20:44.474 --> 05:20:45.714]  Why has he done that so good?
[05:20:46.670 --> 05:20:48.011]  He's proven leadership.
[05:20:48.412 --> 05:20:52.776]  He's proven that, in spite of it all, he's not a perfect man, but he is a leader.
[05:20:53.277 --> 05:21:01.905]  And that's what I appreciate about the 44th President of the United States we elect.
[05:21:01.985 --> 05:21:03.126]  I'd like to see him address
[05:21:07.441 --> 05:21:08.663]  By giving them driver's licenses?
[05:21:09.604 --> 05:21:10.866]  Illegal citizens.
[05:21:25.399 --> 05:21:26.760]  All right, great job, David.
[05:21:27.241 --> 05:21:29.423]  Anything else you'd like to give from David, Alex?
[05:21:29.903 --> 05:21:32.866]  No, just tell David we've got... I just want to say there's about 2,000 people here.
[05:21:32.926 --> 05:21:36.989]  We can't really grasp the enormity of how big it was, but they would cheer.
[05:21:37.309 --> 05:21:45.697]  We had a chance to speak with Paul Sadler, if that's the way you pronounce his name, Senator Cruz's opponent, now Senator Cruz's opponent.
[05:21:46.377 --> 05:21:53.023]  And he was basically saying that he is concerned over the fact that Obama enforced the Patriot Act and NDAA.
[05:21:53.363 --> 05:21:54.223]  Oh, did Senator Cruz win?
[05:21:54.243 --> 05:21:55.684]  Yeah, Senator Cruz is anti-New World Order.
[05:21:55.864 --> 05:21:56.444]  So Cruz won.
[05:22:09.389 --> 05:22:09.629]  Okay.
[05:22:10.350 --> 05:22:15.316]  Alright, great job, David Ortiz, live on scene at a Democratic Party right here in Austin.
[05:22:15.676 --> 05:22:21.903]  And David, if you guys could go outside and maybe get a reaction, maybe an interview or two with some of the happy Obama people.
[05:22:22.404 --> 05:22:23.605]  Yeah, we're going to come back to him.
[05:22:23.625 --> 05:22:25.227]  We're going to come back to him for Know Me, Prince.
[05:22:25.868 --> 05:22:28.371]  Okay, so we're about to go back to Know Me, Prince.
[05:22:28.912 --> 05:22:30.013]  Rob, did you ever find that video?
[05:22:31.605 --> 05:22:42.273]  Okay, so we're actually just a short clip for our viewers out there who may not have seen this report I did last week talking about how students in Chicago were actually eating road and driving.
[05:22:42.293 --> 05:22:43.034]  This is not hype.
[05:22:43.054 --> 05:22:44.355]  This is not something I'm making up.
[05:22:44.675 --> 05:22:47.497]  If we can roll that video right now whenever you are ready.
[05:22:47.517 --> 05:22:51.180]  Several Chicago schools have earned a failing grade in the cafeteria.
[05:22:51.560 --> 05:22:59.285]  Since 2011, 244 of Chicago's 681 public schools failed at least one inspection.
[05:22:59.906 --> 05:23:05.209]  At Cameron Elementary, inspectors found a mice-dropping infestation in the main kitchen.
[05:23:05.229 --> 05:23:05.670]  Delicious.
[05:23:05.710 --> 05:23:07.971]  With more than 600 scattered droppings.
[05:23:07.991 --> 05:23:08.832]  Michelle says it's good for you.
[05:23:08.872 --> 05:23:16.577]  At Fresh Metro High School, mice got into some nachos and several students actually got sick eating rodent droppings.
[05:23:16.857 --> 05:23:20.639]  That's a real report.
[05:23:20.960 --> 05:23:23.101]  And even if you don't believe me, you can believe the lady.
[05:23:23.421 --> 05:23:26.343]  She looks like a very, very respectable lady.
[05:23:26.683 --> 05:23:31.006]  But anyway, Alex, if you're ready, we'll throw it back to you and you can continue your coverage.
[05:23:31.446 --> 05:23:32.187]  Thank you, Zucari.
[05:23:32.207 --> 05:23:37.490]  We'll come back to you and David Ortiz there in the Obama victory orgy coming up.
[05:23:38.110 --> 05:23:41.713]  Nomi Prins was, what, a managing director with Goldman Sachs, I don't know, 10 years ago?
[05:23:41.773 --> 05:23:43.634]  Blew the whistle, written a couple of best-selling books.
[05:23:43.995 --> 05:23:45.796]  We're getting her on about 15 minutes late.
[05:23:45.836 --> 05:23:50.740]  I apologize, but we're a little bit behind tonight, obviously, here, and I've been on the air more than 10 hours now.
[05:23:50.760 --> 05:23:53.042]  I want to just say, great job, the entire crew.
[05:23:53.062 --> 05:23:57.665]  Hey, I'm really liking this, with reporters out on the street, the crew over there, everybody.
[05:23:57.685 --> 05:23:58.906]  This is great job, crew.
[05:23:58.926 --> 05:23:59.627]  I just want to say that.
[05:24:00.727 --> 05:24:03.850]  And hey, I'm feeling good, because I'm getting a free Obama phone.
[05:24:05.486 --> 05:24:06.607]  Alright, it doesn't even matter.
[05:24:06.687 --> 05:24:11.370]  I mean, literally, it was like, do I want to be flayed alive with Romney or put in a meat grinder under Obama?
[05:24:12.251 --> 05:24:14.472]  I'm just glad this stuff is moving towards a close.
[05:24:14.913 --> 05:24:17.034]  Now, the New York Times is not saying it's done yet.
[05:24:17.534 --> 05:24:21.417]  Fox News and what's it called over there?
[05:24:21.477 --> 05:24:22.338]  The Huffington Post.
[05:24:23.178 --> 05:24:25.940]  George Soros, Time Warner, AOL Post.
[05:24:26.920 --> 05:24:30.742]  They are, oh my gosh, Obama is getting a landslide, man.
[05:24:31.082 --> 05:24:40.367]  They're now saying 284 electoral juicies versus Mitt Romney's 203.
[05:24:40.967 --> 05:24:43.769]  Looks like the evangelical Christians stayed home.
[05:24:44.719 --> 05:24:45.800]  And not that it matters.
[05:24:46.000 --> 05:24:47.222]  I mean, just listen.
[05:24:47.282 --> 05:24:48.843]  Obama's coming after your guns.
[05:24:49.404 --> 05:24:51.546]  Romney was going to try to start a war with Russia.
[05:24:51.566 --> 05:24:52.787]  I don't know which one's worse.
[05:24:55.190 --> 05:24:58.233]  I mean, this is entering the realm of total insanity.
[05:24:58.253 --> 05:25:03.618]  Naomi Prins, best-selling author, researcher, whistleblower, insider, joins us.
[05:25:04.039 --> 05:25:07.783]  Naomi, what do you make of this ridiculous spectacle here on election night?
[05:25:08.626 --> 05:25:11.127]  Well, I think like you, I'm glad it's over.
[05:25:12.607 --> 05:25:14.547]  It was a spectacle, it is a spectacle.
[05:25:14.567 --> 05:25:32.251]  I think, I feel disappointed, not because Obama won, because had Romney won, I would have felt equally disappointed, because throughout the campaigning and throughout the debates and throughout the coverage of them, there was so very little attention paid to any factual detail.
[05:25:33.092 --> 05:25:37.137]  Not about the economy, not as I'm sure you've talked about, national security and other issues.
[05:25:37.738 --> 05:25:48.613]  But where I focus on, the Wall Street aspect, the insurance company aspect, the Federal Reserve aspect, there was almost nothing mentioned about those items and when it was, it wasn't true.
[05:25:49.013 --> 05:25:49.854]  From either side.
[05:25:49.914 --> 05:25:52.517]  Romney did a bad job of calling out Obama lying.
[05:25:52.897 --> 05:25:59.463]  Obama did a bad job of skirting through and not even knowing what his administration did or didn't do, or at least pretending he didn't.
[05:25:59.904 --> 05:26:01.686]  And it was just disappointing.
[05:26:01.766 --> 05:26:07.692]  So I think what we have now is more of what we had yesterday without all of the fanfare.
[05:26:09.204 --> 05:26:09.945]  I agree with you.
[05:26:10.045 --> 05:26:13.408]  I mean obviously this could still be contested with what we put the map up there.
[05:26:13.488 --> 05:26:18.412]  Florida, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado.
[05:26:18.932 --> 05:26:19.352]  That's it.
[05:26:19.432 --> 05:26:21.314]  You got four states still in play.
[05:26:21.334 --> 05:26:25.758]  Because I mean you know when Fox News is agreeing with the Huffington Post.
[05:26:26.758 --> 05:26:31.843]  Their maps, their maps, in fact guys go from your map on Huffington Post to my map here on Fox News.
[05:26:32.463 --> 05:26:38.912]  I mean, when, you know, the folks that called it for Bush when Al Gore, the evidence show, was probably the winner.
[05:26:39.513 --> 05:26:43.619]  They're saying it looks like the establishment wants four more years of Obama.
[05:26:43.639 --> 05:26:44.180]  Go ahead, Nomi.
[05:26:45.014 --> 05:26:45.854]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[05:26:45.974 --> 05:26:50.256]  I was flipping back and forth between CNN and Fox just because I do that.
[05:26:50.796 --> 05:26:56.758]  And yeah, within 30 seconds of CNN announcing Obama had won, actually Fox did.
[05:26:56.778 --> 05:26:59.819]  I was surprised to see that Fox had conceded as fast as they did.
[05:27:00.039 --> 05:27:04.180]  But it just again shows you how very little was really at stake here.
[05:27:05.261 --> 05:27:08.542]  At the margin, both of those sort of same but
[05:27:09.042 --> 05:27:17.624]  Presenting themselves as polar media institutions say the same thing at the same time, kind of is another indication of how this whole show went down.
[05:27:20.725 --> 05:27:23.286]  What are you expecting now that you're at the same megabanks?
[05:27:23.306 --> 05:27:28.427]  I mean, talk about your Goldman Sachs experience, or was it JP Morgan?
[05:27:28.447 --> 05:27:32.068]  I forget, I didn't have your full bio tonight and I'm a little bit tired of being on air more than 10 hours.
[05:27:33.569 --> 05:27:34.569]  It was Goldman Sachs, right?
[05:27:35.479 --> 05:27:37.199]  I was at Goldman, I was at Barrow.
[05:27:37.239 --> 05:27:37.840]  You were at a bunch.
[05:27:37.860 --> 05:27:43.941]  I mean, so from your experience at, what was it, Managing Director or whatever, of this type of stuff, where are they going?
[05:27:44.001 --> 05:27:48.482]  Because they're gutting Europe, they're gutting us, they're launching more wars.
[05:27:48.602 --> 05:27:52.683]  I mean, it's like watching Caligula run around and marry his horse or something.
[05:27:52.703 --> 05:27:54.464]  I mean, we are seeing elitist insanity.
[05:27:54.564 --> 05:27:55.824]  Or do you disagree with that statement?
[05:27:56.360 --> 05:27:57.041]  No, absolutely.
[05:27:57.121 --> 05:28:04.887]  One thing I realized this morning, well I knew it, but I checked it, was that Europe had fallen off the map of our media because of the election.
[05:28:05.087 --> 05:28:21.802]  Now Europe is in a completely cataclysmic state, as we are, but we've hidden it so well with so much money from the Treasury Department creating debt, from the Federal Reserve and keeping excess debt on its books that Wall Street basically utilizes in the form of their zero interest rate policy,
[05:28:22.222 --> 05:28:29.183]  Which only helps the financial institutions keep their flow and their show going and hasn't funneled its way into the rest of the country.
[05:28:29.503 --> 05:28:32.624]  Not in terms of reducing loans, not in terms of mortgages, not in terms of anything.
[05:28:32.964 --> 05:28:36.084]  So all of that basically is something that we're still dealing with.
[05:28:36.144 --> 05:28:42.645]  And the fact that Obama, during his campaigning and he'll continue, he doesn't even need to mention this anymore because it's kind of done.
[05:28:42.686 --> 05:28:44.246]  He said he has reformed Wall Street.
[05:28:44.606 --> 05:28:45.506]  It is laughable.
[05:28:45.586 --> 05:28:48.667]  And the fact that Romney didn't call him up on it was also laughable.
[05:28:48.707 --> 05:28:49.847]  So they're both at fault for that.
[05:28:49.867 --> 05:28:50.987]  But we're stuck with Obama.
[05:28:51.567 --> 05:29:01.272]  Pretending and getting most of the population, or at least the half that voted for him, to believe that he somehow contained Wall Street, which he did not.
[05:29:01.552 --> 05:29:04.593]  They're still not showing what's truly on their books.
[05:29:04.633 --> 05:29:08.575]  They're still floating on zero interest rates, which aren't funneling into the rest of the economy.
[05:29:09.515 --> 05:29:18.880]  More than half of the five trillion dollars of debt that the Treasury Department never bothered to explain and wasn't asked, and that Romney didn't ask about either and just assumed it was
[05:29:19.580 --> 05:29:24.744]  You know, because of, quote, I don't know, big government, was because it was used to float Wall Street.
[05:29:24.804 --> 05:29:26.946]  Almost two trillion of that is still in the Fed's books.
[05:29:27.006 --> 05:29:29.428]  It's in the 1.6 trillion dollars of treasury bonds.
[05:29:29.728 --> 05:29:31.089]  Debt created to do nothing.
[05:29:31.649 --> 05:29:36.033]  All of these things are part of the philosophies we're going to inherit that Wall Street is floating upon.
[05:29:36.533 --> 05:29:45.921]  And their next game, aside from decimating Europe, and I mentioned this on the show before, is looking at how Latin America is the next area of opportunity for Wall Street.
[05:29:45.941 --> 05:29:52.306]  When they say area of opportunity, it means area to basically take advantage of because they didn't do it the first time, i.e.
[05:29:52.326 --> 05:29:57.971]  when the housing crisis was being created and when the European crisis was created on the back of that.
[05:29:57.991 --> 05:30:00.273]  Now it's kind of funneling into Latin America.
[05:30:00.313 --> 05:30:01.094]  That's the next step.
[05:30:01.434 --> 05:30:03.335]  Health insurance is a next step.
[05:30:03.355 --> 05:30:08.596]  There are some mega mergers that have happened in the wake of quote Obamacare, which isn't care.
[05:30:09.436 --> 05:30:23.360]  And that is because these insurance companies are basically merging together to consolidate and take competition away from insurance rather than do what Obamacare says it was supposed to do, which is create more competitive rates for people to choose from and to reduce premiums.
[05:30:23.920 --> 05:30:30.902]  All of that stuff, and I just said a lot, you'll probably unpack it for me, but all of that stuff has not changed and will not change.
[05:30:31.322 --> 05:30:44.825]  It's just been put beneath a media story that's focused on soundbites and the campaign which is focused on smaller soundbites and now we're left with the remains of that going forward into four more years.
[05:30:48.519 --> 05:30:57.661]  Yeah, I mean, Obama can sit here and loot us for foreign megabanks better than Romney can because when Obama orders torture, it's loving.
[05:30:57.721 --> 05:31:00.402]  When he orders the bombing of Libya or Syria, it's loving.
[05:31:00.782 --> 05:31:02.962]  When he puts Al-Qaeda into a country, it's loving.
[05:31:03.002 --> 05:31:06.343]  When he offs an ambassador using Al-Qaeda, it's trendy.
[05:31:07.203 --> 05:31:08.883]  When he wiretaps us, it's cool.
[05:31:09.944 --> 05:31:12.344]  Whenever he does a banker bailout, it's fun.
[05:31:12.964 --> 05:31:15.005]  And so the system's like, hey, we like this.
[05:31:16.245 --> 05:31:19.986]  Maybe from now on we'll, quote, have minority presidents forever.
[05:31:21.106 --> 05:31:22.907]  Because, I mean, it just seems to work.
[05:31:22.967 --> 05:31:26.048]  I mean, white liberals say, hey, do whatever you want, I'm not racist.
[05:31:26.768 --> 05:31:30.129]  And, quote, minorities say, hey, this is great, this guy looks like me.
[05:31:30.149 --> 05:31:33.310]  I mean, it's just completely, absolutely shallow.
[05:31:33.770 --> 05:31:36.251]  Obama now is just absolutely sweeping.
[05:31:36.871 --> 05:31:43.252]  They're now saying over at Fox News and over at George Soros, Media Matters, whatever you call it, Huffington Post, 290 votes
[05:31:45.493 --> 05:31:47.936]  Electoral votes to 203.
[05:31:48.356 --> 05:31:51.379]  So this is a landslide.
[05:31:52.120 --> 05:31:53.642]  Right now, these numbers prove accurate.
[05:31:54.321 --> 05:31:56.343]  Yes, it's landslide, you know, electorally.
[05:31:56.443 --> 05:31:58.765]  On a popular vote, it's pretty close.
[05:31:58.805 --> 05:32:03.589]  Last I looked, it was actually sliding towards Romney, and I don't know where the final vote is going to be.
[05:32:03.649 --> 05:32:15.020]  It's going to be very, very close on a popular vote, which is indicative of the division in the country, and it's obviously a landslide and a win on the electoral side, which also tells you a lot about how the Electoral College doesn't represent
[05:32:15.791 --> 05:32:16.392]  The country.
[05:32:16.412 --> 05:32:32.829]  But again, I think a lot of why Obama has won and has particularly won the swing states that he won is because he did manage to convince people and Romney did not manage to have an alternative or convince people otherwise or ask the right questions or whatever it was.
[05:32:33.570 --> 05:32:41.619]  That said, hey, I bailed out the auto industry, I fixed Wall Street, and I'm going to provide lower-cost health care for everyone.
[05:32:42.039 --> 05:32:52.671]  And the thing is, even if he truly believed he was doing those things, they haven't happened, which meant he either didn't believe it and he said he did it, or he does believe it and it won't happen, and either way, we're left with
[05:32:52.671 --> 05:32:52.831]  I don't
[05:33:13.658 --> 05:33:19.084]  Increase their premiums for us by 15% since the policy was passed.
[05:33:19.344 --> 05:33:25.210]  And they're continuing to merge and consolidate and will reduce competition rather than increase competition.
[05:33:25.290 --> 05:33:26.291]  And nobody's noticing.
[05:33:26.331 --> 05:33:27.792]  Not in either party, not in the news.
[05:33:28.213 --> 05:33:32.997]  And then the third thing, the auto bailout, at the end of the day that was a bailout that was started by Bush.
[05:33:33.338 --> 05:33:35.460]  It was continued by default by Obama.
[05:33:35.700 --> 05:33:42.705]  And the fact of the matter is that both GM and Chrysler declared bankruptcy in June and April of 2009.
[05:33:42.845 --> 05:33:44.046]  They did go bankrupt.
[05:33:44.426 --> 05:33:53.873]  So the whole argument about who helped the industry or didn't help the industry, it still went through a bankruptcy and it still came out with actually a total of fewer jobs.
[05:33:53.913 --> 05:33:56.835]  And this is according to GM's own books.
[05:33:57.095 --> 05:33:59.497]  So a lot of what was said didn't actually happen.
[05:33:59.617 --> 05:34:03.520]  And this is where I get really annoyed at the whole telling of it.
[05:34:07.762 --> 05:34:18.793]  I know me before we let you go and obviously get updates from you soon and and and and go to these phone calls from Harminder in Hong Kong, Lester in Arkansas, Lewis in Oklahoma, Nick in California, Noel in Virginia.
[05:34:18.813 --> 05:34:25.219]  We're going to get to everybody in a moment before we go back to Jakari Jackson, our reporters on the ground, watching this Obama people celebrate.
[05:34:25.239 --> 05:34:28.983]  I want to get into any other points you'd like to add about where you think things are going from your
[05:34:31.067 --> 05:34:31.307]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:34:50.709 --> 05:34:52.169]  You almost can't even debate them.
[05:34:52.210 --> 05:34:56.011]  It's like talking to a child when I was watching a reporter out there.
[05:34:57.071 --> 05:35:00.972]  So you've come here to the mall to see Santa Claus.
[05:35:00.992 --> 05:35:02.193]  They're like, yeah, Santa Claus.
[05:35:02.233 --> 05:35:03.013]  He won.
[05:35:03.493 --> 05:35:05.214]  Santa Claus, we're doing good.
[05:35:05.294 --> 05:35:06.334]  Santa Claus is my friend.
[05:35:06.374 --> 05:35:07.314]  He bring me presents.
[05:35:07.974 --> 05:35:10.235]  And you almost just can't even argue with them.
[05:35:10.255 --> 05:35:11.956]  They just don't even get it.
[05:35:12.736 --> 05:35:15.717]  And I think that's what the establishment realizes is that you've got
[05:35:16.517 --> 05:35:21.159]  I don't say this with pleasure because I don't think of myself as particularly, you know, the greatest person around.
[05:35:21.560 --> 05:35:26.702]  It's actually saddening that more and more people I talk to are, they might as well already be in a grave.
[05:35:26.942 --> 05:35:28.203]  I mean, they're not even alive.
[05:35:28.243 --> 05:35:29.183]  They have no mind.
[05:35:29.203 --> 05:35:30.544]  They're just idiots.
[05:35:31.385 --> 05:35:34.346]  They're just, they're just mindless little trendy vassals.
[05:35:34.906 --> 05:35:38.668]  And I have no idea what they're going to do as things continue to rot and fall apart.
[05:35:39.849 --> 05:35:45.752]  And as they continue to cling to the lies and feel that they've been fulfilled by these, you know, empty delusions of grandeur.
[05:35:46.834 --> 05:36:01.193]  Well that's the thing, this entire spectacle is about the degree of shallowness in the political system and yes it has devolved and gotten more shallow and yes the media has been a part of that and everything has become a soundbite without a lot of
[05:36:01.954 --> 05:36:03.135]  I'm not making this stuff up.
[05:36:19.086 --> 05:36:23.510]  That's why it is so frustrating that people don't see this.
[05:36:23.611 --> 05:36:36.164]  And I think either they're so demoralized that the idea of two choices actually seems like choice rather than just sort of, you know, two heads of the same coin or, you know, not a heads and a tails.
[05:36:36.324 --> 05:36:37.285]  They actually are the same.
[05:36:37.705 --> 05:36:48.712]  And I think that's sad, because I believe that Americans can be smarter than that and can actually look at more informative dialogue, but it's just not happening.
[05:36:49.133 --> 05:37:07.465]  And I think not just the results of this election, it was obviously going to go to Obama or to Romney and went to Obama, but the way in which the entire election was packaged, the lack of clarity on the issues, the lack of questions, the lack of data, the lack of just anything of content,
[05:37:07.945 --> 05:37:12.269]  Was something that I just haven't seen in all the other elections that I've been alive for?
[05:37:12.289 --> 05:37:15.752]  Well yeah, they had to do that because they were so close to each other in reality.
[05:37:16.274 --> 05:37:17.354]  They were so close.
[05:37:17.394 --> 05:37:20.936]  Their foreign policy was nearly identical, if not identical.
[05:37:20.976 --> 05:37:26.678]  Their Wall Street policy, and I wrote a piece about this, how Wall Street won the selection before we had it, was identical.
[05:37:26.718 --> 05:37:28.758]  Obama said he regulated Wall Street and didn't.
[05:37:29.139 --> 05:37:32.640]  Romney said we should regulate Wall Street and didn't realize it wasn't re-regulated.
[05:37:32.680 --> 05:37:33.280]  So it didn't matter.
[05:37:33.300 --> 05:37:34.841]  They were on the same side of that issue.
[05:37:36.501 --> 05:37:37.682]  They were on the same side.
[05:37:37.722 --> 05:37:44.164]  Now we have Obama who basically will continue what he has done, which is to act as if he
[05:37:44.824 --> 05:37:56.434]  He has saved things like Wall Street's malice towards the rest of society, like healthcare, like the auto industry, when in fact there's really no deep analysis as to how that happened.
[05:37:56.634 --> 05:37:59.476]  There's no deep analysis as to why we have the debt that we have.
[05:38:00.057 --> 05:38:00.537]  It's just...
[05:38:01.738 --> 05:38:07.922]  There and now we don't even have an opportunity to pretend to have it in presidential debates.
[05:38:07.982 --> 05:38:22.712]  It's just going to sort of go into the ether and we're going to be the next phase of this financial crisis because everything that has been created, the way the banks have operated, the way the insurance companies, which are banks, are acting more and more like banks every day, are operating is on
[05:38:23.613 --> 05:38:38.560]  The wake of the last crisis on having money that's to them available for free, on sitting back while everything else is inflated and the price of everything is inflated for the rest of the population, middle class, upper class, poorer class, the gamut, and that's what we're going to be left of.
[05:38:38.580 --> 05:38:41.281]  There's no need at this point for Obama to do anything else.
[05:38:41.541 --> 05:38:43.502]  The vote has been cast.
[05:38:44.062 --> 05:38:52.146]  The expectation to him is that he doesn't need to do anything, even if he wanted to, because whatever he did that wasn't enough was enough to get re-elected.
[05:38:53.055 --> 05:38:58.118]  NomiPrince.com is the website and I noticed you're writing a new book, All the President's Bankers.
[05:38:58.979 --> 05:39:00.960]  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[05:39:00.980 --> 05:39:12.228]  I'm going to all the archives and getting all the original documents for the past hundred years of the presidents, the bankers that surrounded them, all the relationships, the dealings, how it affected us.
[05:39:12.308 --> 05:39:15.150]  It's really, it's a lot of work but it's very exciting.
[05:39:15.550 --> 05:39:17.632]  I hope it will be good when it's all sorted.
[05:39:18.308 --> 05:39:20.429]  What's your prediction in the next four years?
[05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:21.890]  I mean, obviously more tyranny.
[05:39:22.311 --> 05:39:24.212]  Will the bad guys just continue to win?
[05:39:24.392 --> 05:39:26.614]  Or, I mean, I do see somewhat of an awakening happening.
[05:39:26.634 --> 05:39:30.136]  There's either people are getting deeper into a coma or they're waking up more and more.
[05:39:30.456 --> 05:39:37.121]  What does Nomi Prins, you know, a whistleblower from inside Goldman Sachs, where do you see things going?
[05:39:38.451 --> 05:39:51.440]  I truly believe that the financial system has not been healthy, and when I say that, it's the international financial system, not just our bigger banks, and I think that's something that's been ignored in this election period.
[05:39:51.500 --> 05:39:55.342]  Their numbers are not representative of what's actually going on.
[05:39:55.383 --> 05:39:57.244]  There's still a lot of fakery in the books.
[05:39:57.284 --> 05:39:59.305]  There's still a lot of floating on zero interest rates.
[05:39:59.485 --> 05:40:08.131]  The Fed's in this position where if they raise rates, it's going to tank the banks, which is going to tank the economy further, which is going to tank the stock market and so forth, which is going to be very negative.
[05:40:08.691 --> 05:40:09.232]  I think so.
[05:40:23.183 --> 05:40:32.830]  So I think it continues and I think it gets worse, and I think it has become, it is a global problem between the United States and Europe, and I think it will also encapsulate Latin America.
[05:40:33.050 --> 05:40:47.061]  There's a lot of countries there that have been ignored, such as Argentina, etc., that will be the next Spain, that have real crises in front of them, and I just think we're going to see another leg of what we saw in late 2008 that's been plastered over by
[05:40:49.663 --> 05:40:55.069]  By the Federal Reserve policy, by creating debt to cover it, but you can only do so so long.
[05:40:55.430 --> 05:41:00.555]  And the globalists have been exporting the inflation, exporting the collapse, but it's creeping back here.
[05:41:00.575 --> 05:41:07.003]  I mean, when the chickens do come home to roost, how bad will it be and what do you see the time frame as being?
[05:41:08.646 --> 05:41:11.087]  Well, I think it happens within the next four years.
[05:41:11.607 --> 05:41:12.808]  I think it's happening.
[05:41:12.828 --> 05:41:20.091]  It's just we're not paying attention to it because in Europe, debt is being created to cover up the negative situation.
[05:41:20.171 --> 05:41:22.792]  Here, trillions of dollars have been created.
[05:41:23.073 --> 05:41:25.594]  And I think with Obama, more will be created.
[05:41:25.674 --> 05:41:29.916]  So I think it's going to be two to three years before we see a massive change.
[05:41:29.936 --> 05:41:32.817]  I think it's going to be, and I've said this before, more of a slow burn.
[05:41:33.157 --> 05:41:36.779]  It's going to be more numbers not quite accurate.
[05:41:37.239 --> 05:41:49.407]  I do believe we're going to see fraud and bad things coming out of the health insurance industry after this wave of mergers that nobody's paying attention to, but that Wall Street is making a lot of money out of while nobody's paying attention to it.
[05:41:49.727 --> 05:42:04.556]  Just like we saw with Enron and WorldCom in the beginning of 2001 and 2002, I think there's this other industry, which is health and insurance, which is going to have some of that fraud in addition to that financial crisis that will re-manifest in the next few years.
[05:42:04.616 --> 05:42:05.777]  But we'll be slowly burning
[05:42:06.855 --> 05:42:16.357]  Anyway, until that time, I think we've got to get a few years of a burn and then a bigger spike in the crisis financially.
[05:42:16.857 --> 05:42:17.297]  All right.
[05:42:17.377 --> 05:42:19.418]  Well, Nomi Prince, thank you for your insight.
[05:42:19.618 --> 05:42:28.500]  And unless they can test this or Florida does something weird, it looks like, well, I mean, it doesn't look like it unless the numbers Fox News are putting out as well.
[05:42:28.900 --> 05:42:29.620]  It's now 281 at Fox News.
[05:42:33.642 --> 05:42:39.526]  To 203 with Mitt Romney, so just a devastating landslide there.
[05:42:39.546 --> 05:42:45.731]  Of course, I put a video out a few days ago saying Mitt Romney wins, question mark, because they were all saying Obama wins in a landslide.
[05:42:45.751 --> 05:42:47.813]  I was thinking it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy with fraud.
[05:42:47.833 --> 05:42:49.534]  I don't have a dog in this fight.
[05:42:50.034 --> 05:42:57.660]  I like Romney's rhetoric better on Second Amendment and things, but I mean, I know that it's just rhetoric, so I've always stated it's just rhetoric.
[05:42:57.720 --> 05:43:00.502]  It's just the projection I'm hearing from Romney
[05:43:01.523 --> 05:43:05.486]  Sounded better, but like a person held underwater, anything looks good.
[05:43:06.407 --> 05:43:18.617]  But quite frankly, for this radio show, if I was a globalist, from a cynical perspective, look out, the info war is about to go into high gear, because talk radio is intrinsically conservative and libertarian.
[05:43:19.518 --> 05:43:22.600]  And I've been through this before and I was bashing Bill Clinton.
[05:43:22.760 --> 05:43:31.566]  I got up to 100 radio stations and then as soon as I got back on the air when Bush got in and was bashing him, I went down to about 35 radio stations in six months.
[05:43:32.086 --> 05:43:34.108]  And then slowly, you know, built back up to over 100.
[05:43:34.348 --> 05:43:38.150]  Now we're going over 140 or so on big stations.
[05:43:38.491 --> 05:43:43.234]  And so it's a very sick feeling to have exposed Obama
[05:43:44.194 --> 05:43:47.497]  And as long as I bash Obama and I'm bashing Romney, it's okay.
[05:43:47.517 --> 05:43:48.598]  Well, now Romney's gone.
[05:43:48.618 --> 05:43:51.280]  I'm going to be going after Obama because he's the front guy.
[05:43:51.980 --> 05:43:56.223]  But it's just so sick how partisan baloney works.
[05:43:56.724 --> 05:44:02.928]  Because now, even though I didn't want Obama to get elected, I didn't want Romney to get elected, but
[05:44:03.949 --> 05:44:10.713]  It just feels dirty to know that now this country is going to be in the fight of its life, no matter who got in, but really under Obama.
[05:44:11.273 --> 05:44:12.494]  And they're going to come after the guns.
[05:44:12.514 --> 05:44:16.075]  They're going to come after the churches with mandates.
[05:44:16.115 --> 05:44:17.876]  They're coming after the energy sector.
[05:44:17.976 --> 05:44:21.478]  I mean, it is going to be a three ring circus.
[05:44:21.758 --> 05:44:23.779]  The Republicans are going to try to impeach him.
[05:44:23.799 --> 05:44:24.440]  Get ready for that.
[05:44:25.240 --> 05:44:28.542]  Uh, on Fast and Furious and on the Benghazi situation.
[05:44:28.562 --> 05:44:32.664]  Uh, it is going to be, uh, massive fireworks.
[05:44:32.704 --> 05:44:34.085]  Closing comments on that statement.
[05:44:34.125 --> 05:44:35.186]  If you agree or disagree, know me.
[05:44:36.736 --> 05:44:37.377]  I think it is.
[05:44:37.437 --> 05:44:50.205]  I think the one thing I'd add is the accountability for the economy, for these issues, just went out the... if there was ever going to be any, has really gone out the window.
[05:44:50.285 --> 05:44:57.950]  And that's really just sad for the general, the economic state of the country, as well as civil liberties and everything else.
[05:44:58.371 --> 05:45:05.976]  I've said this, it's not a question of bashing, it's a question of wanting leaders to be accountable for what they're doing and not pretend they aren't doing it.
[05:45:06.696 --> 05:45:10.238]  And hope that everyone will believe them.
[05:45:10.799 --> 05:45:14.361]  And unfortunately, what we saw in this election is that many, many people will.
[05:45:14.521 --> 05:45:17.723]  And from my perspective, I just see a lot of things happening.
[05:45:17.743 --> 05:45:18.823]  Sure.
[05:45:19.364 --> 05:45:24.587]  All these acts getting passed, whether it's Obamacare or the Dodd-Frank Act, saying they're doing things that they're not doing.
[05:45:24.927 --> 05:45:34.693]  I don't mind agreeing or disagreeing with things, but when you just don't even have a platform of sort of a common truth to start from, it's really frustrating.
[05:45:34.713 --> 05:45:35.013]  Sure.
[05:45:36.394 --> 05:45:40.156]  I mean, it's total fraud wrapped within scams, wrapped within lies.
[05:45:40.856 --> 05:45:42.317]  It is diversion within diversion.
[05:45:42.337 --> 05:45:45.318]  And this is a mandate for more tyranny.
[05:45:45.759 --> 05:45:50.381]  Not that Romney was good, but, you know, if they kicked Obama out, it would be a mandate for change.
[05:45:50.681 --> 05:45:55.003]  They're saying, no, we like the way this is going, if you believe the election results.
[05:45:55.063 --> 05:46:01.706]  And quite frankly, there are so many people that want their free goodies, even though it destroys their future, that it might even be a real election.
[05:46:01.966 --> 05:46:03.707]  Nomi Prince, thank you so much for the time.
[05:46:03.727 --> 05:46:04.688]  You were going to say something?
[05:46:05.421 --> 05:46:08.287]  I was saying, Wall Street's on top of that heap of wanting their good.
[05:46:08.347 --> 05:46:11.574]  I mean, it's throughout the system.
[05:46:11.594 --> 05:46:12.856]  That's the issue.
[05:46:13.393 --> 05:46:14.654]  Nomi, thank you so much for the time.
[05:46:14.674 --> 05:46:15.894]  Thank you.
[05:46:16.454 --> 05:46:20.516]  We've got Harmander, Lester, Lewis, Nick, Noel, and others.
[05:46:20.596 --> 05:46:21.557]  I will get to you.
[05:46:21.637 --> 05:46:24.458]  I'm going to take a five-minute break here because I'm exhausted, obviously.
[05:46:24.478 --> 05:46:26.559]  I want to be able to listen to your questions and pay attention to them.
[05:46:26.579 --> 05:46:28.300]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[05:46:28.380 --> 05:46:31.542]  On election night, we're going to take a bunch of calls, but I want to go to Jakari Jackson.
[05:46:38.485 --> 05:46:44.948]  And David Ortiz with their latest info and their David downtown Austin at the Driscoll Hotel.
[05:46:46.188 --> 05:46:47.168]  Old Cattleman Hotel.
[05:46:47.188 --> 05:46:48.629]  My favorite hotel in Austin.
[05:46:48.649 --> 05:46:49.869]  We had our honeymoon there.
[05:46:49.889 --> 05:46:50.410]  Nice place.
[05:46:51.490 --> 05:46:55.312]  But the point is, is that we're going to get some more of the Obama zombies down there.
[05:46:56.012 --> 05:46:57.913]  And the Republicans are zombies too.
[05:46:57.933 --> 05:46:59.553]  But I wanted to give you a couple pieces of news.
[05:46:59.893 --> 05:47:02.474]  This is from the state of California.
[05:47:02.494 --> 05:47:03.435]  Some really bad news.
[05:47:03.935 --> 05:47:05.035]  And of course it's all fraud.
[05:47:05.055 --> 05:47:06.576]  I mean the polls didn't really show this.
[05:47:07.116 --> 05:47:09.078]  Genetically engineered labeling foods.
[05:47:09.098 --> 05:47:10.299]  1,423,159 votes.
[05:47:10.319 --> 05:47:11.379]  41.7 want to label them.
[05:47:11.440 --> 05:47:13.141]  How dare you want to know what's in your food, you scum.
[05:47:13.281 --> 05:47:15.563]  And 58.3 or 1.988.887 or 1.9 million do not want.
[05:47:15.583 --> 05:47:18.625]  Imagine, do you really believe that?
[05:47:18.645 --> 05:47:20.087]  I do not want to know what's in the food.
[05:47:34.130 --> 05:47:39.914]  I want to know if it has sugar or whatever, but I don't want to know if it's got pesticide in it that grows in the corn.
[05:47:40.935 --> 05:47:41.916]  I don't want to know.
[05:47:41.936 --> 05:47:47.640]  I want my kids to eat whatever Big Pharma says because they're run by eugenicists sworn to kill me and my family.
[05:47:47.960 --> 05:47:48.661]  I just think it's a...
[05:47:49.685 --> 05:47:50.726]  No one buys this.
[05:47:50.806 --> 05:47:51.687]  No one believes this.
[05:47:52.227 --> 05:47:57.152]  But they knew of California, their bellwether state, got reconquered by the people, that it would sweep things.
[05:47:57.612 --> 05:48:00.975]  I guess some good news, because it's for states' rights, whether you're pro-marijuana or not.
[05:48:01.435 --> 05:48:06.319]  Amendment 64 passes Colorado, legalizes marijuana for recreational use.
[05:48:07.060 --> 05:48:15.087]  About 36% of precincts reporting at the time of publishing, News 9 and Fox 31 report the Amendment 64 has passed of an overwhelming majority.
[05:48:15.107 --> 05:48:17.629]  So not just for medical use, which the feds then try to ban.
[05:48:17.909 --> 05:48:19.791]  I thought Obama, that's another flip-flop he did.
[05:48:20.091 --> 05:48:23.494]  He said he was going to let medical marijuana happen and he's been more of an enforcer than Bush.
[05:48:23.514 --> 05:48:24.435]  I mean, again.
[05:48:25.512 --> 05:48:32.616]  I mean, he's just such a stinking fraud, and these idiots make comments on YouTube and send me emails, and, you're just a racist.
[05:48:32.656 --> 05:48:34.717]  It's usually some white, yuppie twit.
[05:48:36.438 --> 05:48:39.379]  You know, you idiots, I'm way beyond that, okay?
[05:48:40.139 --> 05:48:41.800]  I watch the sunrise in the morning.
[05:48:42.120 --> 05:48:46.503]  I'm, you know, I was out there this morning with a comarin, or car-marin, however you pronounce those little birds.
[05:48:47.483 --> 05:48:50.365]  I have some Freudian lack of being able to pronounce it right.
[05:48:50.425 --> 05:48:52.746]  Comarin, how do you pronounce those little, they look like loons.
[05:48:56.212 --> 05:48:58.133]  Comer and you know, that's still not right.
[05:48:58.753 --> 05:49:03.156]  Anyways, the point is Comer and still not right.
[05:49:03.416 --> 05:49:04.576]  The 50th trial be the thing.
[05:49:05.317 --> 05:49:10.759]  I'm swimming in a natural pool pouring out of the Colorado River this morning at like 630 in the morning.
[05:49:11.920 --> 05:49:14.601]  And I'm and I wish I had a video camera.
[05:49:14.621 --> 05:49:15.922]  I have a little waterproof camera.
[05:49:15.942 --> 05:49:20.905]  I shot video and the light the Sun was always about 730 by then the Sun had come up.
[05:49:21.285 --> 05:49:23.006]  It was shooting down into the water.
[05:49:24.062 --> 05:49:25.743]  And I was watching this cormorant.
[05:49:26.284 --> 05:49:27.524]  I know I'm mispronouncing that.
[05:49:27.564 --> 05:49:29.766]  It's like, where would you know you're mispronouncing a word, but it doesn't matter.
[05:49:30.006 --> 05:49:34.609]  This bird, this water bird, was going down into reeds like 25 feet under.
[05:49:36.621 --> 05:49:40.622]  And would stand there for like two minutes and was chasing fish through the reeds.
[05:49:41.042 --> 05:49:42.142]  And they were like bass.
[05:49:42.642 --> 05:49:45.323]  I'm telling you, this would be on like, nobody's seen this on TV.
[05:49:45.383 --> 05:49:46.903]  I'm talking 25, 30 pound.
[05:49:46.983 --> 05:49:48.184]  These are world record bass.
[05:49:48.784 --> 05:49:55.265]  Their bass this long and this fat were chasing it when it was helping flush other fish.
[05:49:55.305 --> 05:50:00.147]  And it was just so magic to be watching this with the sun rays coming through in the early morning.
[05:50:00.767 --> 05:50:01.847]  I mean, it was like heaven.
[05:50:03.536 --> 05:50:07.018]  And I just want everybody to know, I have transcended Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.
[05:50:07.298 --> 05:50:07.678]  Okay?
[05:50:07.759 --> 05:50:11.040]  I mean, words do not describe what I saw this morning again.
[05:50:11.060 --> 05:50:13.922]  And beauty is all around me, and nobody can steal that.
[05:50:14.382 --> 05:50:16.444]  Not all your GMO, not all your poison.
[05:50:16.584 --> 05:50:18.425]  You cannot take my soul, New World Order.
[05:50:19.125 --> 05:50:22.627]  Let's go to Jakari Jackson with an update with David Ortiz out there.
[05:50:22.667 --> 05:50:29.510]  Then we're going to take your phone calls from Hong Kong to Colorado, from California to Oklahoma, from Tennessee to Arkansas.
[05:50:30.031 --> 05:50:36.114]  Coming up in the final stretch and then Webster, Griffin Darby, I'm sure he'll be celebrating.
[05:50:37.134 --> 05:50:39.996]  Like he said about Mitt Romney, leppin' the hood up to no good.
[05:50:40.016 --> 05:50:41.717]  You think I'm joking, but I was like, what are you talking about?
[05:50:42.257 --> 05:50:43.518]  Oh, you guys go to YouTube.
[05:50:44.158 --> 05:50:45.279]  It's on our YouTube channel.
[05:50:46.899 --> 05:50:50.882]  I think it's... Webster Tarpey tells his secret or something.
[05:50:51.382 --> 05:50:52.543]  He starts quoting Leprechaun 4.
[05:50:53.303 --> 05:50:53.683]  It's gold.
[05:50:54.524 --> 05:50:58.726]  So the star of Leprechaun 4 will be joining us as well coming up.
[05:50:58.766 --> 05:51:00.547]  But here is our own Jakari Jackson.
[05:51:00.907 --> 05:51:03.989]  Jakari, I know you and David Ortiz are celebrating right now, aren't you?
[05:51:05.727 --> 05:51:07.248]  Yeah, we're celebrating.
[05:51:07.268 --> 05:51:08.509]  We're trying to get David on the line.
[05:51:08.529 --> 05:51:09.950]  I think we lost connection with him.
[05:51:10.511 --> 05:51:18.937]  But Obama for another four years, so more NDAA, more Patriot Act, more wiretapping.
[05:51:18.977 --> 05:51:22.159]  And if we can go to the map, pull that up real quick, we'll take a look.
[05:51:27.083 --> 05:51:28.705]  Oh, Comrade, that's the bird.
[05:51:28.885 --> 05:51:30.667]  Wow, now he's up to 290.
[05:51:31.288 --> 05:51:34.111]  See, mid-hit 203, it's like he just stopped.
[05:51:34.271 --> 05:51:37.154]  He gave us a phone, and now he's gonna do more.
[05:51:38.103 --> 05:51:40.985]  Yeah, he's gonna do more like take your phone or tap your phone.
[05:51:41.245 --> 05:51:44.987]  You know, that's how they caught the family who the Sopranos is based off of.
[05:51:45.348 --> 05:51:48.610]  They gave them all free phones that had the wiretaps built into them.
[05:51:48.890 --> 05:51:50.971]  This is back in the day when you actually had to tap your phones.
[05:51:51.011 --> 05:51:54.413]  But that's how real, the phones all are admitted to have wiretaps built into them.
[05:51:54.753 --> 05:51:55.514]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[05:51:55.834 --> 05:51:57.535]  So anyway... Jakarta, you take it away.
[05:51:57.595 --> 05:52:00.657]  I'm gonna take a five-minute break and... Take a break, Alex.
[05:52:00.677 --> 05:52:01.117]  Take a break.
[05:52:01.257 --> 05:52:03.619]  I mean, I'm not gonna go take a piss or anything.
[05:52:05.325 --> 05:52:05.745]  I'm sorry.
[05:52:05.765 --> 05:52:06.605]  Tell him for all for free!
[05:52:06.965 --> 05:52:11.606]  All right, let's go to the Twitter page, the hashtag Puppet Prez.
[05:52:12.586 --> 05:52:16.647]  Yes, we can follow our election coverage and we'll take a look at a few of the tweets here.
[05:52:17.367 --> 05:52:20.928]  No puppet left behind, Obama wants us killed.
[05:52:20.948 --> 05:52:26.849]  Let's see, oh, praise tyranny, praise the oppressor, Kenny's suicide.
[05:52:27.329 --> 05:52:28.809]  Take a look at a few more here.
[05:52:29.329 --> 05:52:33.870]  He's extremely dangerous, controlled by his corporations.
[05:52:35.668 --> 05:52:42.792]  And see, hearing people talk about which candidate they prefer is like listening to a child talk about seeing Santa Claus at the mall.
[05:52:43.372 --> 05:52:47.135]  So, that pretty much sums it up right there.
[05:52:47.195 --> 05:52:52.218]  Whether you like Obama or you like Romney, you're pretty much voting for the same guy with different rhetoric.
[05:52:52.238 --> 05:52:56.941]  The only thing I can say Obama has over Romney, I think he's a little cooler.
[05:52:57.481 --> 05:52:59.081]  You know, he's a slick cat.
[05:52:59.462 --> 05:53:05.563]  But anyway, since Alex is off to the lavatory, Rob, if you can pull up that video we tried to play earlier about We Are Change.
[05:53:06.043 --> 05:53:07.984]  And whenever you get that ready, just let me know.
[05:53:08.624 --> 05:53:13.745]  So anyway, in the meantime, I have an article or two I would like to share with you, and you guys just let me know whenever you're ready.
[05:53:14.185 --> 05:53:15.906]  Headline, after Sandy.
[05:53:16.786 --> 05:53:17.306]  Are you ready, Rob?
[05:53:18.880 --> 05:53:23.425]  Okay, after Sandy, Bloomberg refused National Guard's help because they have guns.
[05:53:23.766 --> 05:53:29.693]  Now we're switching a little bit from the election coverage to talk about the storm for a little bit, but this is still a pressing issue.
[05:53:29.993 --> 05:53:38.904]  And in this article it says, Mayor Bloomberg didn't want help from the National Guard because, quote, the NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns.
[05:53:39.861 --> 05:53:54.771]  So if you're dying of starvation, or you're cold, or your area is flooded, then, you know, that's too bad because the National Guard has guns, and we know the only people in New York who have guns are the police and the criminals.
[05:53:55.151 --> 05:53:56.973]  Some people say they're one and the same, but whatever.
[05:53:56.993 --> 05:54:04.257]  But anyway, if you guys are ready with that clip, we will roll it now from We Are Changed, and this is We Are Changed San Antonio.
[05:54:04.297 --> 05:54:09.601]  They came in contact with some police officers in San Antonio when they were trying to promote
[05:54:10.362 --> 05:54:13.026]  They're beliefs for a third party, so let's take a look at that clip.
[05:54:15.538 --> 05:54:16.599]  Can I get your badge number?
[05:54:17.339 --> 05:54:18.621]  I mean, Ortiz 1732.
[05:54:19.101 --> 05:54:22.103]  Cuz yeah, he's shining a light in my face.
[05:54:22.744 --> 05:54:25.666]  Man, I wanna listen, but he's right between us.
[05:54:26.247 --> 05:54:29.389]  I mean, we can go to the sidewalk if that's what you want.
[05:54:29.409 --> 05:54:29.950]  All right, thank you.
[05:54:30.050 --> 05:54:31.411]  Ortiz, yeah, I appreciate that.
[05:54:31.451 --> 05:54:31.771]  Yeah.
[05:54:31.811 --> 05:54:32.032]  Wow.
[05:54:32.092 --> 05:54:32.772]  Wow, Ortiz.
[05:54:45.453 --> 05:54:51.696]  Okay, so you saw on the video right there, people just peacefully, they weren't even protesting, they were giving away things.
[05:54:52.056 --> 05:55:09.384]  How dare you give away something in the United States of America, giving out free information, free DVDs or whatever they had on them at the time, just promoting the idea of a third party candidate, whichever candidate that may be for you, and the police come over and harass you, see Officer Ortiz there.
[05:55:10.244 --> 05:55:11.105]  Harassing the people.
[05:55:11.225 --> 05:55:16.467]  The guy was trying to talk to another officer and Ortiz comes and shines his light in the guy's face.
[05:55:16.907 --> 05:55:20.208]  And then when the guy said, hey, if you're going to shine your light on me, I'm going to get you on camera.
[05:55:20.288 --> 05:55:23.310]  Ortiz is, you know, I don't know what that was.
[05:55:23.370 --> 05:55:25.370]  It was pretty childish if you ask me.
[05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:29.772]  But, you know, I've had my experiences down in San Antonio, so I can't say that I'm surprised.
[05:55:30.132 --> 05:55:31.853]  But it's good to see the guys from We Are Change.
[05:55:31.933 --> 05:55:34.754]  I had a chance to meet some of them at the student RFID protest.
[05:55:35.034 --> 05:55:35.715]  They've been active.
[05:55:35.735 --> 05:55:38.636]  They've been in our videos a few times here at InfoWars.
[05:55:39.136 --> 05:55:40.637]  So good to you guys.
[05:55:40.697 --> 05:55:42.079]  We are Chained San Antonio.
[05:55:42.459 --> 05:55:43.920]  Keep up the good work.
[05:55:45.141 --> 05:55:49.225]  Okay, now we actually have an update on the weed amendment in Colorado.
[05:55:49.585 --> 05:55:50.226]  The marijuana.
[05:55:50.446 --> 05:55:51.126]  That's the amendment.
[05:55:51.427 --> 05:55:52.147]  64 passes.
[05:55:52.508 --> 05:55:55.510]  Colorado legalizes marijuana for recreational use.
[05:55:55.550 --> 05:55:58.673]  And you heard Alex talk about that just one second ago.
[05:55:58.693 --> 05:55:59.313]  Oh, that's nice.
[05:56:00.374 --> 05:56:00.934]  Cute picture.
[05:56:01.335 --> 05:56:06.657]  Alright, so you can get your Rocky Mountain High on in Colorado.
[05:56:07.137 --> 05:56:13.901]  They passed it for recreational use, so I guess it's going to get a little sticky up there in Colorado.
[05:56:14.281 --> 05:56:17.542]  We'll keep you up to date on the latest pot developments.
[05:56:17.623 --> 05:56:21.524]  I think Washington is still counting votes as well as some other places.
[05:56:21.544 --> 05:56:22.425]  We'll keep you up to date.
[05:56:22.885 --> 05:56:26.988]  With Proposition 37 and all the other things that are going on in California.
[05:56:27.008 --> 05:56:28.069]  Do we have that?
[05:56:28.149 --> 05:56:28.729]  Okay, let's see.
[05:56:28.789 --> 05:56:32.272]  Proposition trailing in early returns.
[05:56:32.312 --> 05:56:38.596]  Okay, a high-profile measure to require new labels on food was trailing in early returns Tuesday.
[05:56:38.636 --> 05:56:41.138]  So there's still more to be counted on that.
[05:56:41.778 --> 05:56:44.120]  And say, see, spending on Proposition 37 exceeded $50 million.
[05:56:46.508 --> 05:56:49.135]  The Yes Campaign raised at least $8.9 million, while No Side raised at least $45 million.
[05:56:54.656 --> 05:56:55.436]  Uh, .6 million.
[05:56:55.476 --> 05:56:57.277]  So, we'll see what happens with that.
[05:56:57.337 --> 05:57:04.338]  It's been getting a lot of support from Monsanto, saying that, no, you do not need any labels on your GMO foods.
[05:57:04.398 --> 05:57:09.179]  Monsanto, of course, just wants to push the agenda of genetically modified foods.
[05:57:09.619 --> 05:57:12.140]  And why wouldn't you want to know what's in your food?
[05:57:12.200 --> 05:57:13.000]  Even if you don't care.
[05:57:13.540 --> 05:57:16.621]  If you don't care that this or that is in your food, it's okay.
[05:57:16.681 --> 05:57:17.261]  Come on, Jakari!
[05:57:17.981 --> 05:57:21.904]  I mean, come on, we need to not know what's in our food.
[05:57:21.924 --> 05:57:30.289]  They have to label everything else, but if it grows its own pesticide or has insect genes in it, or even rat droppings for that matter, how dare you?
[05:57:30.789 --> 05:57:34.892]  Can you believe you're on the air actually advocating that things be listed on food?
[05:57:36.653 --> 05:57:47.120]  I don't want my children, I don't have children, but if I lived in the city of Chicago, I would not want my children to eat rat droppings, or, especially from a GMO rat, because, guys, pull up that picture of that GMO rat.
[05:57:47.340 --> 05:57:47.981]  They won't believe it.
[05:57:48.641 --> 05:57:49.842]  Uh, you know what I'm talking about.
[05:57:50.162 --> 05:58:01.970]  But anyway, I don't want my kids to eat rat droppings, or any other things that come from these GMO rats, so, Alex, if that makes me a bad person, then I'm just a bad person, and... Hey, I'm going down to the dress code to party right now.
[05:58:01.990 --> 05:58:03.431]  I'm feeling pretty darn good right now.
[05:58:03.451 --> 05:58:05.292]  That actually looks like a pretty happening party.
[05:58:05.332 --> 05:58:06.233]  I think that's where we should...
[05:58:06.993 --> 05:58:09.435]  I think we should have our roundtable at the Driscoll party.
[05:58:09.875 --> 05:58:11.056]  I think that would be a good idea.
[05:58:11.816 --> 05:58:16.359]  We'll just go down there and run around screaming and yelling about how great the Obama phone is or something.
[05:58:17.339 --> 05:58:19.220]  Alright, Jakari, great job with your reporting.
[05:58:19.240 --> 05:58:19.981]  We're going to come back to you.
[05:58:20.001 --> 05:58:20.501]  There we go.
[05:58:20.521 --> 05:58:21.141]  GMO rats.
[05:58:21.521 --> 05:58:22.202]  Yeah, very healthy.
[05:58:22.862 --> 05:58:23.402]  Very healthy.
[05:58:23.903 --> 05:58:26.644]  Get a rat dropping from that and then put that in your school lunch.
[05:58:27.265 --> 05:58:31.347]  And that'll be exactly what you need, because you know in Chicago they don't want you to pack your own lunches.
[05:58:32.219 --> 05:58:33.299]  And now she said that's spreading.
[05:58:33.319 --> 05:58:35.140]  There are more places that don't allow that.
[05:58:35.340 --> 05:58:37.301]  Yeah, no, it's under new federal guidelines.
[05:58:37.341 --> 05:58:41.523]  They kind of use Michelle Obama, our gracious fuhrer, fuhrer, fuhrerlet.
[05:58:41.543 --> 05:58:43.324]  What do you call the female fuhrer?
[05:58:43.344 --> 05:58:45.005]  I don't know what you would call that.
[05:58:45.025 --> 05:58:46.005]  The fuhrer frow.
[05:58:46.725 --> 05:58:48.926]  The frow fuhrer, I don't know what you call that.
[05:58:48.986 --> 05:58:52.628]  The Liebling fuhrerlet, fuhrer gowlite, something, I don't know.
[05:58:53.468 --> 05:58:54.449]  But listen, Jakari, great job.
[05:58:54.469 --> 05:58:59.012]  We're going to come back to you one more time in closing after Webster Tarpley coming up.
[05:58:59.032 --> 05:59:01.033]  We'll get Aaron to pop in here as well.
[05:59:01.053 --> 05:59:02.474]  In fact, I'm going to bring Aaron, I think, in here.
[05:59:02.794 --> 05:59:05.055]  You guys can do kind of a roundtable at the end.
[05:59:05.436 --> 05:59:12.060]  I'm going to take four or five calls and talk to Tarpley, and then I'm going to go get, if I drive home and then get up, I always get up at like 5 a.m., 5.30.
[05:59:12.380 --> 05:59:14.201]  Even if I go to bed at like 2 in the morning, I'll get up at 5.36.
[05:59:14.261 --> 05:59:15.121]  You're a beast, Alex.
[05:59:15.822 --> 05:59:16.602]  No, I'm not a beast.
[05:59:16.682 --> 05:59:18.624]  I wish I could stay asleep now.
[05:59:19.948 --> 05:59:31.955]  But I'm a drug addict for coffee, so I wake up... Well Alex, one thing, since we're on the topic of our new Fuhrer, or however you say that word, we have the Obama Deception at the InfoWars shop.
[05:59:32.375 --> 05:59:36.698]  You can also get it with Dreams of My Real Father by Joel Gilbert.
[05:59:36.838 --> 05:59:38.199]  You can see it's on sale right there for $19.95.
[05:59:40.180 --> 05:59:41.781]  Two power-packed films for $19.95.
[05:59:43.202 --> 05:59:45.203]  Check that out at the InfoWars shop.
[05:59:45.663 --> 05:59:48.344]  And by the way, those films are now going to stay popular.
[05:59:48.384 --> 05:59:50.826]  We have to... We have to... Oh, yes.
[05:59:50.846 --> 05:59:51.886]  There's nothing else, Alex.
[05:59:51.906 --> 05:59:54.328]  We got four more years to sell an Obama deception.
[05:59:54.488 --> 05:59:56.629]  So, something good came out of this.
[05:59:56.649 --> 05:59:59.630]  But again, it's not like I'm for Obama or for Romney.
[05:59:59.670 --> 06:00:02.432]  It's like, either way, it's like, it's horrible.
[06:00:04.178 --> 06:00:06.400]  Well, I think Ortiz was talking about it.
[06:00:06.440 --> 06:00:08.081]  He said he wants new trash.
[06:00:08.441 --> 06:00:09.822]  He doesn't want the trash at the dumpster.
[06:00:09.842 --> 06:00:11.563]  He just wants the trash he fills up at his house.
[06:00:12.044 --> 06:00:14.325]  So that's pretty much what we got going on here.
[06:00:14.385 --> 06:00:18.348]  And any other analogies, the Porter Potty analogies or whatever else you want to use?
[06:00:18.368 --> 06:00:19.349]  Yeah, I think that's it.
[06:00:19.389 --> 06:00:22.271]  It would have been fun to beat up on Romney the puppet for a while.
[06:00:23.965 --> 06:00:29.708]  You know, I think with Obama, we may have a chance to actually wake people up, because now we have a track record.
[06:00:30.169 --> 06:00:35.732]  So when he gets into it, he's like, he's had four years to fix this or that, and he still hasn't done it.
[06:00:35.992 --> 06:00:41.675]  So now that excuse is going to start wearing off, because you saw even some of the people, Ortiz had a chance to interview a few minutes ago.
[06:00:42.035 --> 06:00:50.080]  They said, well, he's cleaning up all the stuff from the past eight years, so we'll see where we are eight years of Obama, and then hopefully that'll wake a person up.
[06:00:50.660 --> 06:00:52.341]  Man, I tell you, I hear you.
[06:00:52.401 --> 06:00:53.401]  It's crazy, Jakari.
[06:00:53.421 --> 06:00:54.141]  Thank you so much.
[06:00:54.181 --> 06:00:57.442]  There's Jakari Jackson, David Ortiz, and the rest of the crew doing a great job.
[06:00:57.462 --> 06:01:00.724]  All right, let's go to Harminder in Hong Kong.
[06:01:00.804 --> 06:01:03.725]  Mike, Lester, Lewis, Nick, and others, thank you for being patient.
[06:01:04.065 --> 06:01:07.326]  Harminder in Hong Kong, we're honored to have you here tonight.
[06:01:07.346 --> 06:01:08.846]  If you're still there, Rob, can you hear me?
[06:01:10.247 --> 06:01:10.987]  Yes, Alex, I can hear you.
[06:01:11.027 --> 06:01:11.647]  Can you hear me?
[06:01:11.928 --> 06:01:12.348]  Yes, sir.
[06:01:12.408 --> 06:01:13.988]  What is your take on all this?
[06:01:14.008 --> 06:01:15.829]  Is there a celebration right now in Hong Kong?
[06:01:17.182 --> 06:01:18.264]  Oh, dear God, yes.
[06:01:19.125 --> 06:01:21.347]  It's Obama Central in Hong Kong.
[06:01:21.467 --> 06:01:23.930]  Everybody falls for the Kool-Aid.
[06:01:24.731 --> 06:01:31.019]  All they do is talk about how great he is, what a leader he is, and how he'll lead America into prosperity.
[06:01:31.059 --> 06:01:33.682]  I'm like, where have you been for the last four years?
[06:01:34.243 --> 06:01:35.605]  Show me this prosperity.
[06:01:38.294 --> 06:01:47.088]  I know, and it's not like Romney would be good either, but if people think this is good, at least if you hit the reset button, you're mandating that you don't like what happened.
[06:01:47.609 --> 06:01:49.932]  This is like, hey, we want more Fast and Furious.
[06:01:51.496 --> 06:01:52.356]  Yeah, but that's the thing.
[06:01:52.396 --> 06:01:55.137]  They don't report on stuff like Fast and Furious here.
[06:01:55.178 --> 06:01:57.759]  They don't report on stuff like NDAA here.
[06:01:58.179 --> 06:02:04.721]  All they talk about is how great Obama is, what an international leader he is and all that.
[06:02:05.062 --> 06:02:11.924]  They don't talk about Syria, you know, the United States government supporting the Al-Qaeda rebels there.
[06:02:12.184 --> 06:02:14.746]  They don't talk about the blacks being murdered in Libya.
[06:02:14.766 --> 06:02:16.106]  They don't talk about any of it.
[06:02:16.206 --> 06:02:17.987]  It's just, whatever's on NBC,
[06:02:18.547 --> 06:02:22.129]  CBS is just rehashed here and say, that's your international news.
[06:02:22.149 --> 06:02:23.210]  There's no analysis.
[06:02:23.550 --> 06:02:24.751]  Local news is fine.
[06:02:24.791 --> 06:02:26.952]  They do a better job on local news.
[06:02:27.212 --> 06:02:32.716]  But, you know, I have to pay to watch RT at least to get an alternative view.
[06:02:33.096 --> 06:02:35.477]  I have to, you know, go on your website.
[06:02:35.958 --> 06:02:37.999]  I'm a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[06:02:38.099 --> 06:02:39.960]  That's where I get my news.
[06:02:40.220 --> 06:02:46.444]  But if I have to watch CNN International, even Fox News directly out of the States, it makes me want to throw up.
[06:02:46.784 --> 06:02:49.566]  Because of how biased the news is.
[06:02:50.447 --> 06:02:58.272]  It just goes one way, that the world is the way we say it is, not this alternative, what they say is a conspiracy theory.
[06:02:58.312 --> 06:02:59.353]  And it makes me sick.
[06:02:59.553 --> 06:03:02.956]  And all my friends on Facebook, not one person has woken up.
[06:03:03.036 --> 06:03:09.901]  It's all about, thank God Obama has another four years to put the country and the world into the toilet, in my opinion.
[06:03:10.061 --> 06:03:10.821]  No, I hear you.
[06:03:11.241 --> 06:03:12.743]  Good to hear from you in Hong Kong.
[06:03:13.043 --> 06:03:14.104]  All I can say is this.
[06:03:14.964 --> 06:03:16.404]  We are not a democracy.
[06:03:17.365 --> 06:03:23.046]  In a democracy, 51% can vote to make the other 49% slaves.
[06:03:24.827 --> 06:03:26.007]  We are a republic.
[06:03:26.027 --> 06:03:29.548]  We're private property, the family, the Second Amendment, stuff like that's protected.
[06:03:29.948 --> 06:03:33.649]  And I got news to all the little parasites that think Obama cares about them.
[06:03:33.769 --> 06:03:34.429]  A, he doesn't.
[06:03:35.029 --> 06:03:40.571]  And B, you're not getting my guns and you can go straight to Hades if you think you're getting them.
[06:03:42.956 --> 06:03:44.897]  And Obama may try to start the Civil War.
[06:03:44.957 --> 06:03:48.999]  He may try to march the military and police in against the American people.
[06:03:50.740 --> 06:03:55.603]  And, you know, there's enough of us that aren't going to go along with it, but it doesn't matter.
[06:03:55.703 --> 06:03:57.364]  Romney would try the same thing, too.
[06:03:57.444 --> 06:03:58.025]  It's just not as...
[06:03:59.592 --> 06:04:00.453]  I'm sick of it.
[06:04:00.513 --> 06:04:03.535]  I mean, do we have to go the way Nazi Germany and Russia went?
[06:04:03.575 --> 06:04:04.836]  I mean, do we really?
[06:04:04.856 --> 06:04:05.956]  Because let me tell you something.
[06:04:05.976 --> 06:04:07.577]  It's not my opinion we're going into tyranny.
[06:04:07.597 --> 06:04:11.800]  Anybody that knows history knows that this is walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, we're in trouble.
[06:04:12.080 --> 06:04:13.241]  It's a lot bigger than Obama.
[06:04:14.201 --> 06:04:22.347]  It's just that the fact that they're putting Obama back in after he said you didn't build that is just a mandate for everything that is destructive.
[06:04:23.527 --> 06:04:24.948]  Let's talk to Kim in Indiana.
[06:04:25.048 --> 06:04:25.849]  Kim, you're on the air.
[06:04:29.179 --> 06:04:38.362]  I'm trying to get prepared here for what may or may not happen, worst-case scenarios and whatnot, and I got a limited budget.
[06:04:39.323 --> 06:04:44.945]  I'm thinking, what is the point of buying a firearm if it's just going to be taken away from me?
[06:04:45.373 --> 06:04:47.735]  Well, number one, people say, exactly.
[06:04:47.815 --> 06:04:49.416]  No, no, and that's true.
[06:04:49.996 --> 06:04:52.498]  People say, why have children?
[06:04:52.598 --> 06:04:53.799]  You know, they could take them from you.
[06:04:53.859 --> 06:04:55.040]  Well, over my dead body.
[06:04:55.721 --> 06:04:56.902]  Why have some gold and silver?
[06:04:56.922 --> 06:04:57.742]  You could get robbed.
[06:04:58.843 --> 06:04:59.864]  You know, why even live?
[06:04:59.904 --> 06:05:00.484]  You could die.
[06:05:02.284 --> 06:05:11.354]  I mean, I would get a firearm, I'd learn how to use it, you can go to a gun show before they shut them down, and there'll be people with private sales who are just, you know, privately, legally selling their gun.
[06:05:12.154 --> 06:05:16.879]  And, uh, you know, you can get, say, a, you know, double-barrel shotgun, you can get a...
[06:05:17.640 --> 06:05:18.340]  A revolver.
[06:05:18.481 --> 06:05:20.522]  And I mean, let me tell you, women make some of the best shots.
[06:05:20.542 --> 06:05:22.703]  In fact, better than men on average with Olympic shooting.
[06:05:22.723 --> 06:05:29.847]  Uh, it's like a stereotype in movies where the old woman shoots the, you know, the .45 and, or the .357 and flies back.
[06:05:29.867 --> 06:05:38.852]  I mean, let me tell you, I can handheld hold 10 round .50 cals and sit there, you know, shooting man-sized targets at 100 yards with it handheld.
[06:05:38.872 --> 06:05:41.293]  In fact, I'm going to do this on camera here pretty soon.
[06:05:41.313 --> 06:05:43.014]  I've got, I'm not going to get into it.
[06:05:43.034 --> 06:05:44.234]  I've got multiple .50s.
[06:05:44.635 --> 06:05:46.616]  The point is, is that
[06:05:47.657 --> 06:05:48.079]  Is that?
[06:05:48.099 --> 06:05:52.090]  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[06:05:52.130 --> 06:05:53.855]  They can take everything from you, but.
[06:05:54.841 --> 06:05:58.123]  Well, the thing is is that I only have so much money to spend, and that's, say, money I could spend on
[06:06:26.971 --> 06:06:33.444]  I would rather die free in the woods than, you know, in a FEMA camp or something.
[06:06:35.428 --> 06:06:36.710]  Ma'am, here's the deal.
[06:06:38.897 --> 06:06:58.587]  What's the quote I keep reading that's posthumous, and not just posthumous, it's unattributed, it's hundreds of years old, it's really over a thousand in different permutations, no one knows where it came from, but, uh, when freedom fails, good men rot in filthy jails, and those that cry, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[06:06:59.327 --> 06:07:00.968]  And I'm not a tough guy.
[06:07:01.812 --> 06:07:03.874]  Okay, and I didn't grow up, I'm a real sweet guy.
[06:07:04.254 --> 06:07:09.198]  But I grew up in Dallas, and my dad was old-fashioned, same thing with him when he grew up getting beat up.
[06:07:10.259 --> 06:07:14.702]  And I'd come home with black eyes and stuff, and my dad would say, well, I don't want to hear about it, you just better stand up for yourself.
[06:07:15.863 --> 06:07:22.228]  And like his dad told him when he used to get beat up, you know, and he was in like sixth grade, he said, well, I don't care if you have to climb up like a tree, I don't want to hear about it.
[06:07:22.889 --> 06:07:29.094]  And maybe that's old-fashioned and wrong, but let me tell you something, I didn't just learn how to fight back, I learned how to enjoy it.
[06:07:30.001 --> 06:07:37.443]  And what I've learned about bullies is they are going to pick on people that are easy targets.
[06:07:39.363 --> 06:07:47.365]  Whether you politically, economically, physically fight back, believe me folks, the tyrants aren't happy about it.
[06:07:47.425 --> 06:07:51.506]  So the answer is exercise our freedoms, expose the globalists.
[06:07:51.966 --> 06:07:54.447]  It's a life and death situation now to expose them.
[06:07:54.947 --> 06:07:57.348]  I mean authoritarianism has taken over every country in the world.
[06:07:57.388 --> 06:07:58.188]  Now it's trying here.
[06:07:59.128 --> 06:07:59.288]  Alright.
[06:07:59.308 --> 06:08:00.669]  Well, thanks for your opinion.
[06:08:00.749 --> 06:08:02.210]  I'll probably go with it.
[06:08:29.906 --> 06:08:31.428]  I'm right below this desk right now.
[06:08:31.448 --> 06:08:39.577]  It is not because of fear that I've got .50 caliber rifles or Reaper .308s.
[06:08:41.279 --> 06:08:42.300]  It is not out of fear.
[06:08:42.380 --> 06:08:43.201]  It is out of power.
[06:08:44.347 --> 06:08:45.747]  And that's what it's all about.
[06:08:45.888 --> 06:08:48.168]  You exercise it or you are overrun.
[06:08:49.489 --> 06:08:52.449]  And that is the story of the world.
[06:08:53.730 --> 06:08:54.950]  Big fish eat little fish.
[06:08:55.010 --> 06:08:56.691]  Well, I'm not one to eat little fish.
[06:08:57.151 --> 06:09:01.312]  I want my family to be safe, so I'm putting on the pure, hardest defense I can.
[06:09:01.352 --> 06:09:02.152]  Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[06:09:02.532 --> 06:09:07.734]  And I'm telling you, we're fighting a bunch of corrupt globalists who are on the edge of collapsing anyways.
[06:09:08.530 --> 06:09:11.892]  Like I've never wanted this country to collapse even though it's banker run because it's going to be hard.
[06:09:11.912 --> 06:09:19.556]  But now I realize that's one of our only hopes is we collapse like the Soviet Union so these globalists get shook off us like a fever, like a high fever.
[06:09:20.296 --> 06:09:26.479]  People think give your kid a bunch of, you know, Tylenol because they're sick with a fever.
[06:09:26.819 --> 06:09:28.020]  You want the fever.
[06:09:28.520 --> 06:09:34.043]  The body heats up for a reason to kill the bacteria or to kill the viral replication.
[06:09:36.232 --> 06:09:38.333]  And we need to have a bad fever, folks.
[06:09:38.353 --> 06:09:42.734]  We need to roll around for three days, vomiting on the floor, and sweating this out.
[06:09:42.794 --> 06:09:44.074]  And I mean that figuratively.
[06:09:45.035 --> 06:09:49.756]  I mean, we need to repent, myself included.
[06:09:49.776 --> 06:09:51.417]  I mean, we're all weak.
[06:09:51.477 --> 06:09:55.798]  We've had so much freedom, we don't realize how good it is until it's gone.
[06:09:55.838 --> 06:09:57.198]  You don't know what you've got until it's gone.
[06:09:57.599 --> 06:10:00.239]  All the cliches ring true because they're not cliches.
[06:10:00.559 --> 06:10:01.160]  They're truth.
[06:10:04.269 --> 06:10:08.430]  I'm just glad to know which new puppet I've got to deal with because the whole thing's a fantasy land.
[06:10:11.210 --> 06:10:12.191]  We got Tarpley on the line.
[06:10:12.211 --> 06:10:17.912]  Alright, we're going to go to him in a minute.
[06:10:17.932 --> 06:10:19.112]  We're getting him lined up right now.
[06:10:19.152 --> 06:10:20.052]  Who's up next here?
[06:10:20.472 --> 06:10:21.333]  Mike in Colorado.
[06:10:21.353 --> 06:10:25.253]  Mike in Colorado, you're on the air ahead of Webster Tarpley.
[06:10:25.274 --> 06:10:25.654]  Go ahead.
[06:10:26.334 --> 06:10:28.394]  Hey Alex, kudos to you and the crew.
[06:10:28.474 --> 06:10:32.015]  I've been watching the networks and you at the same time and you totally did it.
[06:10:33.058 --> 06:10:34.439]  Much better coverage.
[06:10:34.719 --> 06:10:35.259]  Well, thank you.
[06:10:35.299 --> 06:10:36.120]  We tried our best.
[06:10:36.520 --> 06:10:40.422]  Apparently next week I get a bipod at 7-Eleven and I can buy Cheetos at the same time.
[06:10:40.482 --> 06:10:42.864]  So, you know, that's got to work.
[06:10:42.884 --> 06:10:46.806]  Absolutely, yeah.
[06:10:47.166 --> 06:10:52.650]  My whole point, and you just said it two seconds before, at least we know which devil we're dealing with.
[06:10:53.870 --> 06:10:59.654]  The weather vane is pointing towards O, and we know where they're coming from, and we know how to fight that.
[06:11:00.666 --> 06:11:02.167]  And let me tell you, it's going to be bad.
[06:11:02.888 --> 06:11:08.051]  Because the globalists use communism as their ground level takeover, while they're exempt offshore.
[06:11:08.111 --> 06:11:08.832]  It's going to get bad.
[06:11:08.852 --> 06:11:15.016]  I mean, their goal, their goal, his advisors, we can play these clubs, came out in federal trials.
[06:11:15.637 --> 06:11:21.141]  They wanted, back then in the 70s and 80s, they wanted to put 50 million in camps and kill 25 million of us.
[06:11:21.541 --> 06:11:25.804]  That number is more like 70 million in camps, 35, they want to kill us.
[06:11:26.525 --> 06:11:27.485]  So make no mistake.
[06:11:28.026 --> 06:11:29.547]  Since they've doubled down tonight,
[06:11:30.342 --> 06:11:31.563]  By giving him a second term?
[06:11:32.164 --> 06:11:38.471]  That tells me that I need to double down to support you and people like us just as much.
[06:11:39.431 --> 06:11:41.813]  Well, brother, we appreciate it, because let me tell you, we're double down.
[06:11:41.853 --> 06:11:46.718]  We're putting all our capital into more reporters, more operations, and we're just... It feels good, though.
[06:11:47.359 --> 06:11:50.983]  I mean, I told Rob Doo last week, I said, listen, man, we're under attack now.
[06:11:51.003 --> 06:11:53.125]  We've got to make sure everything we do is accurate.
[06:11:53.145 --> 06:11:54.386]  We've got to double-check everything.
[06:11:54.727 --> 06:11:58.571]  We're like X-Wings going in against the Death Star, and they got their big turbo lasers aimed at us.
[06:11:59.031 --> 06:12:00.473]  And Doo looked at me, and he goes, that's a good feeling.
[06:12:01.013 --> 06:12:06.655]  And it is, because we're living, we're real, we're not zombies obsessed with the NFL.
[06:12:06.975 --> 06:12:10.576]  We know what's going on, we're aware, and this is an incredible time to be alive.
[06:12:10.896 --> 06:12:20.098]  And I'm not leaving the country, like Gerald Solente says, I'm all in against the globalists, I'm putting it all down, and this fight hasn't even started.
[06:12:21.039 --> 06:12:25.340]  Again, they control both candidates, they control the machines, it's all a fraud.
[06:12:25.660 --> 06:12:27.541]  Yeah, you got a bunch of domesticated children.
[06:12:27.761 --> 06:12:30.501]  Did you see those Obama supporters we showed with David Ortiz?
[06:12:30.601 --> 06:12:32.362]  I mean, those weren't bad people.
[06:12:32.762 --> 06:12:34.403]  Those were like five-year-olds.
[06:12:35.083 --> 06:12:37.803]  Those people have never seen anything real in their lives.
[06:12:38.624 --> 06:12:40.384]  And they're not even bad people.
[06:12:40.424 --> 06:12:41.184]  They're children.
[06:12:41.545 --> 06:12:48.687]  And wait till the government doesn't... I've talked to so many people I know that live in New York and New Jersey, including one of my crew members' parents who were pro-government.
[06:12:49.107 --> 06:12:51.667]  Now they know the government isn't their friend after it didn't deliver.
[06:12:51.947 --> 06:12:53.008]  Just like New Orleans knows.
[06:12:53.048 --> 06:12:53.668]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[06:12:54.335 --> 06:12:55.936]  No, and tonight they turned it up.
[06:12:55.976 --> 06:12:56.957]  They showed their hand.
[06:12:57.337 --> 06:12:58.818]  They showed you what they want to do.
[06:12:59.378 --> 06:13:02.360]  And so that gives us the chance to say, okay, this is what you want?
[06:13:02.820 --> 06:13:03.581]  More of Obama?
[06:13:03.641 --> 06:13:03.981]  Fine.
[06:13:04.001 --> 06:13:04.882]  We're going to go this way.
[06:13:08.021 --> 06:13:11.103]  Well, yeah, and before we go to Tarpley, God bless you.
[06:13:11.123 --> 06:13:11.883]  Great points, Mike.
[06:13:11.924 --> 06:13:14.285]  We're going to pull up Emperor Palpatine.
[06:13:14.365 --> 06:13:21.650]  He is pleased that his minion... I mean, it's kind of like Darth Tyrannus versus Darth Vader, you know.
[06:13:22.470 --> 06:13:30.675]  Both work for the Emperor, but Mitt Romney has been... Mitt Romney has been dealt with, and now Darth Vader, he goes, he goes, rise, Lord Vader.
[06:13:31.656 --> 06:13:34.157]  That's basically what's happening with Puppet Obama.
[06:13:34.598 --> 06:13:38.179]  Because they love using political correctness all day on people.
[06:13:38.820 --> 06:13:42.962]  No, I don't want Emperor Palpatine, I want Lep in the hood up to no good.
[06:13:44.952 --> 06:13:54.159]  Because Tarpley, I've been told, has Leprechaun 4 memorized, Dr. Webster Tarpley, and Leprechaun 5.
[06:13:54.199 --> 06:13:58.082]  Okay, okay, I haven't seen it, I just was told.
[06:13:59.323 --> 06:14:03.526]  And we have a YouTube video, it's something like Webster Tarpley tells us his secret or something.
[06:14:03.947 --> 06:14:09.331]  We're gonna find this tonight before the transmission ends, because, well hell, he can do it right now for us.
[06:14:09.771 --> 06:14:14.155]  Webster, I would imagine that you are in sublime ecstasy right now.
[06:14:15.236 --> 06:14:16.057]  Oh, you're still trying to get him up?
[06:14:16.077 --> 06:14:16.577]  I thought you had him.
[06:14:17.918 --> 06:14:23.701]  I thought five minutes ago you said you had him on Skype, so that's why I was... No, I don't mind.
[06:14:23.741 --> 06:14:24.501]  It's just always fun.
[06:14:24.522 --> 06:14:29.865]  Like, we've got Tarpley, and then, like, we don't have Tarpley, and, you know, and then I'm sitting here.
[06:14:30.065 --> 06:14:31.366]  Remember, I'm on the air.
[06:14:31.486 --> 06:14:37.749]  I understand out there is your own bubble world where you're working hard, but, uh, Aaron, come on in here.
[06:14:37.769 --> 06:14:41.832]  Uh, Aaron, can you find, uh, Lep in the hood up to no good?
[06:14:43.993 --> 06:14:45.354]  It's on the Alex Jones Channel.
[06:14:45.514 --> 06:14:46.555]  It absolutely is, yeah.
[06:14:46.575 --> 06:14:48.116]  They're in the Bilderberg coverage.
[06:14:48.156 --> 06:14:49.917]  That mic's been on the whole time, or did they just turn that on?
[06:14:49.937 --> 06:14:52.779]  Oh, they just turned it on.
[06:14:53.399 --> 06:14:55.400]  Yeah, can you go find Lep in the Hood up to no good?
[06:14:56.301 --> 06:14:59.623]  I'm gonna make an executive decision, because this is gonna go on for hours sometimes.
[06:15:00.103 --> 06:15:04.206]  Instead of him on video Skype, we will just go with phone.
[06:15:04.826 --> 06:15:07.188]  Oh my gosh, ladies and gentlemen, we have Webster Griffin Darbling.
[06:15:07.728 --> 06:15:08.248]  Thank you, Aaron.
[06:15:08.568 --> 06:15:11.490]  Listen, will you go help them find Lep in the Hood up to no good?
[06:15:11.610 --> 06:15:12.471]  Ohio could be interesting.
[06:15:13.394 --> 06:15:13.975]  Ohio?
[06:15:14.015 --> 06:15:15.375]  But I mean, that wouldn't win it for him.
[06:15:15.415 --> 06:15:17.737]  I mean, he's already so far ahead.
[06:15:17.757 --> 06:15:20.079]  Maybe Romney's gonna save us?
[06:15:20.599 --> 06:15:21.300]  There's a chance?
[06:15:21.820 --> 06:15:22.761]  Oh, Romney!
[06:15:23.521 --> 06:15:26.043]  I'm actually wearing Mitt Romney underwear, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:15:26.103 --> 06:15:31.126]  I'm not gonna... I mean, let me tell you, when I get home tonight, I'm gonna roll around in tears, like the crying game.
[06:15:31.146 --> 06:15:36.050]  Uh, when I realize that I just... I'm really upset right now, let me tell you.
[06:15:38.973 --> 06:15:39.854]  So ridiculous.
[06:15:40.774 --> 06:15:47.640]  We have to sit here and debate all this meaninglessness, but we do that to bring people in to teach them how it's a bunch of bull.
[06:15:48.881 --> 06:15:50.482]  Ladies and gentlemen, do I have Tarpley?
[06:15:50.522 --> 06:15:51.062]  Does it work?
[06:15:54.165 --> 06:15:57.227]  No, I know it is incredibly fun to play with the Skype.
[06:15:57.547 --> 06:15:58.368]  I'm going to say it again.
[06:15:58.388 --> 06:16:00.950]  I can walk off the air and do it.
[06:16:01.691 --> 06:16:03.212]  I go to his telephone.
[06:16:05.970 --> 06:16:07.952]  And every time I say go to telephone, they go, oh there we go!
[06:16:07.972 --> 06:16:10.315]  And then it's never there.
[06:16:10.335 --> 06:16:14.780]  It's just like building and building and building and building and building!
[06:16:16.762 --> 06:16:17.883]  Hey, I shouldn't be complaining.
[06:16:17.903 --> 06:16:18.764]  It's like Star Trek.
[06:16:18.784 --> 06:16:20.346]  We can talk to Maryland up there.
[06:16:21.192 --> 06:16:26.414]  With all the government little mushroom heads, and like, teleporting in.
[06:16:26.835 --> 06:16:37.420]  Tarpley, I would imagine right now, doctor of history, economist, I would imagine right now you're savoring this victory over what you call the Mormon Mafia.
[06:16:37.860 --> 06:16:39.641]  How is it feeling right now, Webster?
[06:16:39.681 --> 06:16:44.283]  And I'm sure you've had your flu shot this season, and you're probably having a Diet Coke to celebrate it all.
[06:16:45.143 --> 06:16:46.244]  Well, Webster, good to have you with us.
[06:16:47.352 --> 06:16:48.072]  That's right, Alex.
[06:16:48.153 --> 06:16:52.615]  And I don't live in the fear that the end of the world is going to take place every week.
[06:16:52.695 --> 06:16:55.037]  And I generally try not to live in fear.
[06:16:55.537 --> 06:16:58.399]  And I don't take counsel of my fears as much as I can.
[06:16:58.419 --> 06:17:00.820]  Now hold on, hold on.
[06:17:00.840 --> 06:17:01.541]  Let's talk about that.
[06:17:01.581 --> 06:17:03.162]  What is that open-ended statement?
[06:17:03.182 --> 06:17:04.523]  Because I'm just joking around here with you.
[06:17:05.003 --> 06:17:06.524]  Can we light you up a little bit?
[06:17:06.544 --> 06:17:08.945]  Or are you like Nosferatu and you can't have any light in there?
[06:17:08.965 --> 06:17:09.566]  Hang on.
[06:17:10.768 --> 06:17:18.711]  I'm just going to be mean to Tarbley the entire show now, because Tarbley, I'm sorry, I don't like Marx or Lenin or Engels, but I know you'll like them.
[06:17:18.731 --> 06:17:20.812]  Have you joined the John Birch Society or what?
[06:17:20.912 --> 06:17:22.753]  Oh my gosh, oh yeah, they're really evil.
[06:17:23.053 --> 06:17:28.676]  Hey listen, you look great, let's just stop for a minute, and I want to apologize for not being nice to you.
[06:17:28.996 --> 06:17:31.057]  You are the star of Leprechaun 5, you did the voice.
[06:17:31.377 --> 06:17:35.999]  Can you please give us, as a celebratory note, Lep in the hood up to no good.
[06:17:36.539 --> 06:17:38.161]  I'll give it to you at the end if you like.
[06:17:38.181 --> 06:17:38.741]  No, no, no.
[06:17:38.801 --> 06:17:40.023]  I must have payment up front.
[06:17:41.044 --> 06:17:44.707]  We've done enough deals together that I can receive payment up front, not at the end.
[06:17:44.747 --> 06:17:45.948]  May I please have my payment?
[06:17:45.968 --> 06:17:47.210]  What do I get in return?
[06:17:49.432 --> 06:17:50.933]  We have the YouTube clip we can play right now.
[06:17:50.953 --> 06:17:52.355]  Can we please have a live Tarpley?
[06:17:53.676 --> 06:17:57.920]  I'm asking you, if I do what you want, what do I get in return?
[06:17:57.960 --> 06:18:00.123]  I will only interrupt you half as much as I'm planning.
[06:18:01.297 --> 06:18:02.878]  And how long do we go on here?
[06:18:02.918 --> 06:18:03.399]  Just a joke.
[06:18:03.439 --> 06:18:05.961]  As long as you want, oh great leader.
[06:18:05.981 --> 06:18:06.682]  Fine.
[06:18:07.142 --> 06:18:08.003]  So what do you want to hear?
[06:18:08.023 --> 06:18:10.365]  I want to hear a police call Leprechaun 5.
[06:18:13.668 --> 06:18:14.568]  You want me gold?
[06:18:14.849 --> 06:18:16.870]  Yeah, I want to see the power right now.
[06:18:17.030 --> 06:18:17.431]  Me gold!
[06:18:17.451 --> 06:18:18.091]  Me gold!
[06:18:18.251 --> 06:18:19.773]  Ron Paul's campaign motto.
[06:18:20.293 --> 06:18:23.876]  And his campaign song is, Lep in the hood out to do no good.
[06:18:23.896 --> 06:18:25.798]  Lep in the hood out to do no good.
[06:18:27.159 --> 06:18:28.020]  Words to live by.
[06:18:28.901 --> 06:18:34.706]  You did not do that with one-tenth of your gravitas that night we were sharing and imbibing in vino.
[06:18:35.547 --> 06:18:38.129]  Next time, next time, provide the drinks.
[06:18:38.469 --> 06:18:39.870]  Tarpley, let's just start over.
[06:18:39.991 --> 06:18:44.355]  You were prescient, okay, in the Obama deception.
[06:18:46.228 --> 06:18:47.129]  I don't think so.
[06:19:07.890 --> 06:19:17.214]  I'm tired of Obama's left cover for torture, wars, Libya, Syria, a warrantless wiretapping the left in a catatonic state, and you're like, no!
[06:19:17.234 --> 06:19:19.895]  You know, blah, blah, blah, it's bad.
[06:19:20.055 --> 06:19:22.556]  Let me just tell you what should happen now.
[06:19:23.276 --> 06:19:27.698]  The time now is to fight Obama on the terrain of austerity.
[06:19:28.493 --> 06:19:38.447]  And this means Obama wants to impose genocidal austerity during the lame duck session with this grand bargain.
[06:19:38.467 --> 06:19:40.269]  But I thought he was going to save me.
[06:19:40.349 --> 06:19:44.715]  First explain why Obama's loins give us Valhalla.
[06:19:45.639 --> 06:19:47.262]  Let's get to the heart of the matter here.
[06:19:47.602 --> 06:19:55.874]  The whole point was, I had a whole meeting in New York City ten days ago of the United Front Against Austerity.
[06:19:56.375 --> 06:19:58.798]  And that is against Romney and against Obama.
[06:19:58.838 --> 06:20:00.781]  We're ready to fight whoever wins the election.
[06:20:01.321 --> 06:20:03.002]  Looks like Obama won the election.
[06:20:03.042 --> 06:20:04.443]  Now we've got to fight Obama.
[06:20:04.463 --> 06:20:07.105]  This poses special problems.
[06:20:07.525 --> 06:20:13.850]  But the main thing is... Why did you like Obama over Lord Romney?
[06:20:14.250 --> 06:20:15.010]  Let me just finish.
[06:20:15.210 --> 06:20:24.717]  We want the economic rights of the American people and Obama will be coming after them with an attempted grand bargain sometime during November, December.
[06:20:24.737 --> 06:20:25.697]  So we want to fight.
[06:20:26.138 --> 06:20:28.980]  We want to fight Obama to a standstill and
[06:20:29.907 --> 06:20:32.289]  And we want to defeat this planned austerity.
[06:20:32.329 --> 06:20:44.938]  Now, the problem for people in the libertarian world is that they think austerity is a great thing and that they're going to criticize Obama that he doesn't have enough genocidal austerity in the program, right?
[06:20:45.538 --> 06:20:49.221]  He doesn't have as many killer cuts in the program as Ron Paul, right?
[06:20:49.321 --> 06:20:53.124]  A lot of these people wanted to completely abolish Social Security.
[06:20:53.644 --> 06:21:04.008]  Remember, the difference between Romney and Obama, Obama is the death of a thousand cuts, Romney is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where you're a bloody pulp within just a few minutes.
[06:21:04.088 --> 06:21:13.012]  So, it is different, but it's also harder to defend against, because with Romney, we would have had an immediate, large-scale, vocal opposition, right?
[06:21:13.452 --> 06:21:16.593]  A hedge fund hyena, a vulture... That's right, that's right.
[06:21:16.613 --> 06:21:19.214]  Let me add this point here, because I want to have a real discussion here, Tarpley.
[06:21:20.655 --> 06:21:26.418]  The establishment wanted Obama on almost every front, because he can sell the fraud better.
[06:21:26.978 --> 06:21:33.661]  No, I don't think so, because in order to do that, you'd have to say, what about the warm welcome that Romney got at the Bilderberger Group?
[06:21:34.101 --> 06:21:37.403]  What about the fact that Wall Street money went to Romney over Obama?
[06:21:37.423 --> 06:21:38.563]  Do you know he was really there?
[06:21:38.583 --> 06:21:39.524]  I never saw proof of that.
[06:21:39.544 --> 06:21:44.166]  Yes, well, you know, it's as proven as anything else in such a meeting.
[06:21:44.997 --> 06:21:51.923]  That Wall Street gave more money, if you count the PACs, the super PACs, and the Romney campaign, he had more money.
[06:21:52.763 --> 06:21:57.507]  And the Federal Reserve, did the Federal Reserve lift a finger to get Obama re-elected?
[06:21:57.527 --> 06:21:58.908]  I don't think so.
[06:21:58.968 --> 06:22:05.594]  You get QE3 about 30-40 days before the election, whatever it was, two months at the most.
[06:22:06.408 --> 06:22:13.230]  And that's not time enough to get the uptick that would have allowed Obama to cruise more effectively.
[06:22:13.310 --> 06:22:20.652]  So, I don't see any evidence that the ruling class wanted Obama... Yeah, but it's all rearranging deck chairs.
[06:22:20.932 --> 06:22:22.372]  Where do you see it going now?
[06:22:22.432 --> 06:22:23.072]  Here's the difference.
[06:22:23.112 --> 06:22:24.193]  I'll tell you what the difference is.
[06:22:24.253 --> 06:22:25.233]  It's a very important difference.
[06:22:26.323 --> 06:22:42.466]  With Romney, the Republican Party is demographically doomed in the sense that it's the party of reactionary white men who are bigots and who are anti-foreigner and... And don't forget, don't want to turn their guns in!
[06:22:43.567 --> 06:22:46.408]  I don't care about their... We'll get their guns, those white bastards.
[06:22:46.429 --> 06:22:47.229]  Yeah, yeah, those white filth.
[06:22:47.249 --> 06:22:49.350]  Whatever their hobby is, I don't care about their hobbies.
[06:22:49.670 --> 06:22:50.351]  This is who they are.
[06:22:50.391 --> 06:22:51.751]  Oh, hold on Tarbley.
[06:22:51.971 --> 06:22:57.034]  The hobby of wanting to have guns when every other culture has been disarmed to be slaves.
[06:22:57.674 --> 06:22:59.575]  I don't care about this issue one way or another.
[06:22:59.635 --> 06:23:01.256]  It's extraneous.
[06:23:01.316 --> 06:23:04.438]  Your Supreme Soviet will rise once the enemy has been disarmed, yes.
[06:23:05.822 --> 06:23:07.964]  And the John Birch Society on the other side.
[06:23:08.244 --> 06:23:11.647]  Hey listen, Obama says he wants to ban handguns and rifles.
[06:23:11.747 --> 06:23:13.068]  Every tyranny wants the guns.
[06:23:13.608 --> 06:23:18.651]  Tarpley, why don't you endorse the Second Amendment?
[06:23:18.992 --> 06:23:22.054]  You claim you endorse the American system, Tarpley.
[06:23:22.414 --> 06:23:24.656]  I want to hear you endorse the right to keep and bear arms.
[06:23:25.336 --> 06:23:25.656]  Sure.
[06:23:26.557 --> 06:23:28.098]  Whatever the state decides, right?
[06:23:28.118 --> 06:23:29.279]  Some places don't want it.
[06:23:29.399 --> 06:23:30.520]  Whatever the state?
[06:23:30.540 --> 06:23:31.581]  You mean the sub-state?
[06:23:32.161 --> 06:23:32.962]  The state, right?
[06:23:33.002 --> 06:23:34.383]  New York City doesn't want it.
[06:23:34.423 --> 06:23:35.764]  Massachusetts doesn't want it.
[06:23:36.104 --> 06:23:37.165]  I don't care about this.
[06:23:37.205 --> 06:23:38.266]  This is a wage issue.
[06:23:38.666 --> 06:23:38.967]  Okay?
[06:23:38.987 --> 06:23:42.169]  The more we focus on this, the bigger dupes and cretins we are.
[06:23:42.649 --> 06:23:44.591]  Here's what the plan was with Romney.
[06:23:45.512 --> 06:23:52.497]  Since the Republican Party is doomed to dwindle as this racist, anti-foreigner, reactionary thing,
[06:23:53.118 --> 06:23:56.982]  And with a candidate is a hedge fund hyena and an asset stripper.
[06:23:57.483 --> 06:24:01.507]  They figured if they could seize the White House now, what could they do?
[06:24:01.928 --> 06:24:05.732]  If Romney had won, he probably would have won the Senate and the House.
[06:24:06.440 --> 06:24:10.424]  Then they would have been able to pack the Supreme Court with fascist judges.
[06:24:10.824 --> 06:24:12.326]  They've got Citizens United.
[06:24:12.546 --> 06:24:16.990]  They can use money to win elections, although it's not as effective as they thought.
[06:24:17.390 --> 06:24:24.177]  They would have busted every union, smashed all opposition, and then they would have begun to restrict the franchise.
[06:24:24.537 --> 06:24:29.780]  They'd say, the Voting Rights Act of 1964 is no good and it has to go.
[06:24:30.160 --> 06:24:36.164]  So you'd get southern states and many other states would be reducing the possibilities of people to vote.
[06:24:36.564 --> 06:24:40.566]  Using voter ID, using harassment, intimidation.
[06:24:40.866 --> 06:24:43.168]  The stuff we saw today, it's really interesting.
[06:24:43.468 --> 06:24:47.710]  The Republicans tried to take away the right to vote and people got angry.
[06:24:48.111 --> 06:24:52.033]  People never value something as much as when they think somebody wants to take it away from them.
[06:24:52.473 --> 06:24:59.375]  So, that would have been the Karl Rove 40-year austerity dictatorship, plus wars!
[06:24:59.735 --> 06:25:05.377]  Because around Romney, you had the nastiest, most aggressive, angry neocons, right?
[06:25:05.817 --> 06:25:16.921]  Bolton, Kagan, Dan Senior, Robert Joseph, Dov Zakim, the whole neocon crew thought they were going to make a comeback with Romney.
[06:25:16.961 --> 06:25:19.322]  So, thank God we have avoided that!
[06:25:20.208 --> 06:25:23.890]  Those problems we don't have, and that would have been harder in many ways.
[06:25:23.930 --> 06:25:25.931]  Thank God for Obama, yeah.
[06:25:26.212 --> 06:25:27.452]  That would have been a police state.
[06:25:27.813 --> 06:25:31.975]  I'm amazed that you can't see that that's the actual danger of dictatorship.
[06:25:32.596 --> 06:25:34.176]  What's going on in Michigan, right?
[06:25:34.477 --> 06:25:39.920]  If they can take over Benton Harbor, and we're still waiting for those Michigan ballot questions.
[06:25:40.595 --> 06:25:49.541]  If the fascist governor of Michigan can put a little Hitler in Benton Harbor and Flint and Pontiac, then they can do it to states, they can do it to the whole country.
[06:25:49.581 --> 06:25:51.663]  That's called creeping fascism.
[06:25:52.263 --> 06:25:55.025]  Looks like we have some respite on that.
[06:25:55.045 --> 06:25:56.346]  Webster, you don't even get it.
[06:25:57.288 --> 06:25:59.869]  I don't like Mitt Romney either.
[06:26:00.109 --> 06:26:04.230]  I made a film with you exposing Obama as a globalist puppet.
[06:26:04.510 --> 06:26:05.730]  They were both puppets.
[06:26:05.770 --> 06:26:07.430]  The agenda moves forward.
[06:26:07.450 --> 06:26:09.731]  Hold on a minute, let me talk.
[06:26:10.451 --> 06:26:17.333]  You're acting like there's some massive difference here and everybody's running around celebrating Obama.
[06:26:18.553 --> 06:26:29.657]  There is a significant difference, and it's the permanent austerity dictatorship of people like Romney, Scalia, these reactionary swine, frankly, right?
[06:26:29.677 --> 06:26:30.737]  That's who it would have been.
[06:26:31.077 --> 06:26:34.178]  And they would have tried to have an authoritarian dictatorship.
[06:26:34.198 --> 06:26:41.200]  But Obamacare isn't even some type of free deal or welfare program, general welfare.
[06:26:41.641 --> 06:26:45.282]  It's written by insurance companies to bring in eugenics care.
[06:26:46.411 --> 06:26:49.012]  Fine, but let's, so let's get inside that and fight.
[06:26:49.432 --> 06:26:54.295]  The problem with you guys is you're always on the outside, right, and you don't want to touch anything.
[06:26:54.695 --> 06:26:58.377]  If you want to have a reform agenda, have a reform agenda.
[06:26:58.757 --> 06:26:59.577]  What should happen?
[06:26:59.597 --> 06:27:05.240]  It's like, we're always left with the idea that radical evil has taken over the universe and there's nothing we can do.
[06:27:05.840 --> 06:27:07.061]  Well, there's plenty we can do.
[06:27:07.361 --> 06:27:08.542]  Get out there and fight.
[06:27:08.962 --> 06:27:10.182]  And the demands are simple.
[06:27:10.222 --> 06:27:11.543]  You want to organize students?
[06:27:11.863 --> 06:27:13.204]  A student loan amnesty.
[06:27:13.484 --> 06:27:16.045]  You want to organize middle class people in the suburbs?
[06:27:16.326 --> 06:27:17.906]  A freeze on all foreclosures.
[06:27:18.147 --> 06:27:20.788]  Foreclosures stop on primary residences.
[06:27:22.149 --> 06:27:23.789]  Jobless benefits are open-ended.
[06:27:24.170 --> 06:27:25.810]  Food stamps are open-ended.
[06:27:26.631 --> 06:27:27.431]  And so forth, right?
[06:27:27.451 --> 06:27:28.452]  To preserve our
[06:27:29.207 --> 06:27:32.128]  Labor power, and then we seize the Federal Reserve.
[06:27:32.448 --> 06:27:39.811]  You seize control of the Federal Reserve, and you start putting out these slices of $1 trillion each, of 0%, 100-year credit.
[06:27:39.831 --> 06:27:46.013]  Sure, sure, if we're going to give the bankers $40-something trillion, we can give people free credit.
[06:27:46.033 --> 06:27:47.413]  Listen, I agree with all that.
[06:27:47.793 --> 06:27:49.614]  Webster, and I get the U.S.
[06:27:49.674 --> 06:27:51.455]  bank-type deal back to the government.
[06:27:51.855 --> 06:27:52.495]  I get all that.
[06:27:53.535 --> 06:27:56.357]  Separately, I really respect your view, because this is where you're really accurate.
[06:27:56.857 --> 06:27:57.658]  What's coming?
[06:27:57.738 --> 06:28:00.640]  What do you see our new Lord and Savior Obama doing now?
[06:28:01.200 --> 06:28:04.102]  He will now try for an austerity package.
[06:28:04.122 --> 06:28:13.608]  He'll try to make it, he'll try to have you, instead of being able to retire at 66 or 67 with Social Security, he'll try to push that to 70 to 72.
[06:28:14.188 --> 06:28:16.430]  The reactionary Republicans will say, no, 75, 80, 85.
[06:28:19.286 --> 06:28:23.320]  Then he'll also try to tamper with the social security mechanism.
[06:28:24.187 --> 06:28:29.631]  So that inflation is understated, so that the actual Social Security benefit dwindles.
[06:28:30.152 --> 06:28:33.814]  We know that the Republicans want to attack food stamps.
[06:28:33.875 --> 06:28:37.617]  This is the Ag Bill, right, the Farm Bill that has not been passed yet.
[06:28:37.697 --> 06:28:38.718]  Very important bill.
[06:28:39.139 --> 06:28:41.961]  The Farm Bill contains the food stamp provisions.
[06:28:42.401 --> 06:28:46.404]  The Republicans want to cut it by, I don't know what, a half, a third.
[06:28:46.824 --> 06:28:49.306]  Obama wants to cut it by 10 or 15 percent.
[06:28:49.366 --> 06:28:50.828]  Well, Webster, let's talk about this.
[06:28:50.888 --> 06:28:53.930]  Listen, I get the states taking care of people.
[06:28:54.210 --> 06:29:00.935]  I get churches in the states helping people that are hungry, but I mean, come on, is it good that food stamps have roughly doubled in five years?
[06:29:01.075 --> 06:29:03.997]  It's damn tickety there, because otherwise all those people would die.
[06:29:04.097 --> 06:29:05.038]  And that's the choice.
[06:29:05.518 --> 06:29:07.039]  Bush brought on the crash.
[06:29:07.580 --> 06:29:10.122]  Bush created the depression.
[06:29:10.142 --> 06:29:12.323]  Of course, Clinton set the stage.
[06:29:12.383 --> 06:29:13.164]  That's also clear.
[06:29:13.664 --> 06:29:19.147]  But by the time you get to 2007-2008, you're in a collapsing bubble.
[06:29:19.488 --> 06:29:22.309]  There's a world derivatives panic, a world banking panic.
[06:29:22.329 --> 06:29:22.809]  No, I got it.
[06:29:22.849 --> 06:29:25.531]  They'll be on the streets, they'll be robbing, they'll be starving.
[06:29:25.851 --> 06:29:29.353]  No, I get, I was about to say, the globalists engineered it so you got to take care of them.
[06:29:29.693 --> 06:29:31.274]  But I mean, where does it go from there?
[06:29:31.334 --> 06:29:32.095]  It just gets worse.
[06:29:32.625 --> 06:29:34.807]  No, because you can organize a recovery.
[06:29:35.048 --> 06:29:36.049]  We know how to do it.
[06:29:36.469 --> 06:29:38.431]  Lend-Lease organized a recovery.
[06:29:38.471 --> 06:29:40.634]  We can actually even do better than Lend-Lease.
[06:29:40.974 --> 06:29:43.537]  You can have a recovery any time you want it.
[06:29:44.118 --> 06:29:50.385]  All you've got to do is get on the phone with Helicopter Ben and tell him we want those trillion dollar trashes.
[06:29:50.785 --> 06:29:51.326]  Here's what you do.
[06:29:51.346 --> 06:29:51.866]  Let me ask this.
[06:29:51.966 --> 06:29:56.251]  Why do the globalist bankers, the oligarchs, not want... We had to get a recovery.
[06:29:56.351 --> 06:29:56.952]  We had to capitalize.
[06:29:56.972 --> 06:30:03.119]  The way you get a recovery is you have a mass movement that says to Bernanke, here's what you're going to do.
[06:30:03.219 --> 06:30:04.320]  We're the mass movement.
[06:30:04.601 --> 06:30:06.222]  We're surrounding the Federal Reserve.
[06:30:06.503 --> 06:30:11.128]  You're going to start putting out trillion dollar slices of credit because we want
[06:30:12.299 --> 06:30:13.939]  Infrastructure in the states, right?
[06:30:14.340 --> 06:30:26.122]  The states, the governors of states, the legislatures of states, and lots and lots of contractors, lots and lots of small and medium capitalist enterprises will benefit from this stuff.
[06:30:26.142 --> 06:30:30.763]  We've got to build the New York to Los Angeles super duper maglev.
[06:30:30.803 --> 06:30:33.404]  We've got to rebuild the interstate highway system.
[06:30:33.744 --> 06:30:36.385]  Sure, well listen, we've talked about this plan 20 times in the year.
[06:30:36.405 --> 06:30:37.205]  But we haven't done it!
[06:30:37.405 --> 06:30:41.566]  You've got to, propaganda, you don't just say it once, you keep hammering until it happens.
[06:30:42.679 --> 06:30:44.881]  No, I know, but they're not going in that direction.
[06:30:45.021 --> 06:30:46.182]  It's all... Hey, how about us?
[06:30:46.662 --> 06:30:48.804]  We're always so worried about what the enemy is doing.
[06:30:48.844 --> 06:30:49.985]  Let's see what we're doing.
[06:30:50.285 --> 06:30:53.588]  Well, in my book, Webster, people don't know about the globalists.
[06:30:56.107 --> 06:30:59.408]  I mean, you know, I mean, I still haven't won that war yet.
[06:30:59.448 --> 06:31:02.429]  You know, we have to expose the big picture.
[06:31:02.449 --> 06:31:07.890]  That's why even debating Obama, Romney and, you know, all this perseverating over Mormon mafias.
[06:31:07.950 --> 06:31:08.910]  I mean, look where we are now.
[06:31:09.250 --> 06:31:10.911]  We've now got the Obama mafia.
[06:31:11.231 --> 06:31:13.411]  If it was Mitt Romney, I'd be saying prepare to face him.
[06:31:13.451 --> 06:31:17.552]  And I mean, do you see any way that Obama is not going to be the president now?
[06:31:17.612 --> 06:31:17.892]  Right now?
[06:31:17.912 --> 06:31:19.352]  I mean, what's he got, guys?
[06:31:19.372 --> 06:31:21.253]  Let's put that up on screen, the numbers we've got.
[06:31:23.717 --> 06:31:28.462]  I mean, you've got 303 electoral votes to 203 with Romney.
[06:31:28.482 --> 06:31:31.065]  That is a gigantic, whopping landslide.
[06:31:31.526 --> 06:31:33.728]  Webster, have you ever seen a landslide like this?
[06:31:34.770 --> 06:31:37.473]  A landslide is like, you know, 60% to 40%.
[06:31:38.113 --> 06:31:41.057]  Landslide is what Johnson did to Goldwater.
[06:31:42.539 --> 06:31:45.842]  That's not a landslide, and it's not really a mandate for anything.
[06:31:46.343 --> 06:31:55.113]  Obama is guaranteed to come out and say, now I can finally make a deal with these fascists in the Tea Party, and give them part of what they want.
[06:31:55.414 --> 06:32:01.281]  And it'll be some tiny little tax increase for the super-rich, which will
[06:32:01.781 --> 06:32:09.391]  Practically not disturb their luxuries and their excesses, but it'll cut deeply into the needs, right?
[06:32:09.431 --> 06:32:12.695]  The actual necessities of the poor.
[06:32:12.735 --> 06:32:14.638]  That's the kind of thing that Obama has in mind.
[06:32:14.758 --> 06:32:16.520]  Because Obama's a Wall Street puppet.
[06:32:17.884 --> 06:32:23.508]  There are Wall Street puppets and Wall Street puppets, and again, the death of a thousand cuts gives you a chance to fight back.
[06:32:23.568 --> 06:32:27.991]  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Romney, I'm afraid, not so good.
[06:32:28.331 --> 06:32:35.176]  So, there is a difference, and I think the situation is actually now somewhat better that we got rid of Romney.
[06:32:35.356 --> 06:32:38.398]  Also, think of the degradation of the American people.
[06:32:38.758 --> 06:32:43.722]  If the American people had been willing to accept a hedge fund hyena, a Wall Street
[06:32:44.262 --> 06:32:49.487]  Assets stripper, a vulture capitalist, a guy with Wall Street... Instead of a puppet of those people, yeah.
[06:32:49.727 --> 06:32:50.407]  Right?
[06:32:50.688 --> 06:32:52.389]  How degraded would that be?
[06:32:52.629 --> 06:32:55.772]  Now, Obama is also, in many ways, a spent force, right?
[06:32:56.132 --> 06:32:58.314]  Obama, as you saw him in the first debate, right?
[06:32:58.634 --> 06:32:59.595]  He's exhausted.
[06:32:59.875 --> 06:33:00.596]  He's tired.
[06:33:00.956 --> 06:33:02.658]  A new administration comes in.
[06:33:03.078 --> 06:33:04.938]  With tremendous criminal energy.
[06:33:05.258 --> 06:33:21.142]  And you would have had the neocons coming in saying, we've got to vindicate our neocon faction because Bush left under a cloud and we're going to have a new aggressive war to rehabilitate ourselves for the last aggressive war in Iraq that didn't go so well.
[06:33:21.162 --> 06:33:22.082]  So that would have been them.
[06:33:22.522 --> 06:33:24.623]  And then you would have had this Mormon mafia, right?
[06:33:24.643 --> 06:33:25.923]  You would have had Mike Leavitt,
[06:33:26.443 --> 06:33:33.369]  And the rest of these people, you would have had a guaranteed Mormon on the Supreme Court, meaning a raving reactionary.
[06:33:33.429 --> 06:33:39.814]  Somebody like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who says that child labor laws are unconstitutional.
[06:33:39.914 --> 06:33:42.636]  I mean, the guys from the Middle Ages, right?
[06:33:42.816 --> 06:33:47.960]  Hey Webster, are you for the Labor Department shutting down people on farms learning how to work?
[06:33:47.980 --> 06:33:49.842]  Because I did that, it was really good for me.
[06:33:50.702 --> 06:33:51.783]  Don't bring in Red Herrings.
[06:33:51.823 --> 06:33:55.305]  The point is, there has to be the right to organize and have a union.
[06:33:55.745 --> 06:33:56.045]  Okay?
[06:33:56.085 --> 06:33:59.927]  And the reason the labor movement is distorted is because it's so weak.
[06:33:59.947 --> 06:34:03.169]  What does that have to do with child labor laws?
[06:34:04.210 --> 06:34:07.932]  Child labor laws are obviously, they're legal and they're constitutional.
[06:34:07.992 --> 06:34:14.375]  And the Senator Lee of Utah is completely unacceptable.
[06:34:14.435 --> 06:34:19.598]  And in fact, one of the interesting things... Should I be able to have my 8-year-old carry trash out?
[06:34:20.572 --> 06:34:21.032]  I don't know.
[06:34:22.313 --> 06:34:27.235]  So I shouldn't tell my 8-year-old on Saturday morning, take this trash outside?
[06:34:27.255 --> 06:34:28.936]  You get these talking points, Alex.
[06:34:29.076 --> 06:34:29.756]  Where do you get these?
[06:34:29.776 --> 06:34:31.097]  No, no, these aren't talking points.
[06:34:31.357 --> 06:34:36.159]  They're trying to say the state wants to take over kids.
[06:34:36.739 --> 06:34:50.225]  And I'm asking you, is it a good idea to have the Department of Labor, the Department of Agriculture come out and say children cannot work on their parents' farms?
[06:34:50.345 --> 06:34:51.626]  I think this is the main problem.
[06:34:51.706 --> 06:34:54.288]  Obviously this is a distortion and this should not happen.
[06:34:54.328 --> 06:34:56.229]  No, I read the thing.
[06:34:56.329 --> 06:34:57.970]  I worked on a farm.
[06:34:58.271 --> 06:35:02.214]  We have 7% of labor in the private sector unionized.
[06:35:02.454 --> 06:35:03.354]  That's just crazy.
[06:35:03.875 --> 06:35:04.735]  It's just crazy.
[06:35:04.996 --> 06:35:08.438]  You've lost the big picture if you think that's the main thing that's happening now.
[06:35:08.658 --> 06:35:09.679]  Because that's not it.
[06:35:10.259 --> 06:35:11.540]  That's somebody's talking point.
[06:35:11.560 --> 06:35:14.102]  Should the Easter Bunny have to be unionized?
[06:35:14.482 --> 06:35:15.223]  Koch Brothers.
[06:35:15.523 --> 06:35:16.063]  How about them?
[06:35:16.424 --> 06:35:17.424]  Is that where it comes from?
[06:35:17.564 --> 06:35:17.945]  I don't know.
[06:35:19.474 --> 06:35:25.336]  And then there's the ridiculous implication that I'm getting information from the Koch brothers.
[06:35:26.116 --> 06:35:27.857]  Well, I don't know where you get this stuff.
[06:35:27.917 --> 06:35:30.498]  If you think that's reality, it's not reality.
[06:35:30.698 --> 06:35:38.040]  No, I read the Labor Department regulation earlier in the year, and it was going to ban any type of farm chores for children.
[06:35:38.380 --> 06:35:39.981]  Here's what's just happened in the United States.
[06:35:40.361 --> 06:35:43.782]  In Wisconsin, the union movement was partially smashed.
[06:35:44.382 --> 06:35:49.245]  In Indiana, it was totally smashed by the fascist Republican Mitch Daniels.
[06:35:49.646 --> 06:35:54.689]  In Ohio, Kasich tried to smash it, and he was defeated in a referendum.
[06:35:55.109 --> 06:36:07.997]  And in Michigan tonight, the big story tonight in Michigan is statewide proposal A and B. A is no more emergency management law, no to that, and B is you do have a right to collective bargaining.
[06:36:08.157 --> 06:36:11.379]  Let me ask you, Alex, do we have a right to collective bargaining?
[06:36:11.900 --> 06:36:12.200]  Do we?
[06:36:13.522 --> 06:36:14.183]  Oh, absolutely.
[06:36:14.223 --> 06:36:17.525]  I think people have a right to organize together and free association.
[06:36:17.925 --> 06:36:19.747]  And I think that's the big picture, right?
[06:36:19.787 --> 06:36:20.527]  There's other stuff.
[06:36:21.708 --> 06:36:29.333]  Well, Webster, when you start foaming, I'm going to be honest with you, because I'm friendly towards you, but you've been in a really aggressive mode the last year or so.
[06:36:29.854 --> 06:36:30.494]  I mean, come on.
[06:36:30.835 --> 06:36:32.436]  I did read the Labor Department deal.
[06:36:32.796 --> 06:36:35.438]  The federal government doesn't want you to be able to spank your kids.
[06:36:35.458 --> 06:36:36.238]  I mean, give me a break.
[06:36:36.739 --> 06:36:39.301]  Oh, Michelle Obama saying what we can eat now.
[06:36:39.941 --> 06:36:41.565]  And I mean, look, look, I'm tired of it.
[06:36:41.625 --> 06:36:42.266]  I like your plan.
[06:36:42.286 --> 06:36:44.851]  Michelle Obama has no power to dictate what you eat.
[06:36:45.132 --> 06:36:47.978]  I know, but she's like the figurehead for the new government regulations.
[06:36:48.018 --> 06:36:50.022]  But listen, what I do like is...
[06:36:51.721 --> 06:36:53.222]  Free credit to the states.
[06:36:54.183 --> 06:36:59.627]  I do like the idea, if you're going to have big work projects, to really have them be disseminated to small businesses.
[06:36:59.687 --> 06:37:05.151]  I have the National Small Business Association guy, what is his name, Lloyd Chapman on all the time.
[06:37:05.471 --> 06:37:12.796]  So, I mean, I get that if we're going to be in a government system, it should be disseminating it down to the real producers and the grassroots.
[06:37:13.056 --> 06:37:15.798]  I mean, I get all this in the models that are available.
[06:37:16.139 --> 06:37:17.680]  I get there's no real free market.
[06:37:18.340 --> 06:37:20.861]  In the globalist, collectivist, corporate, fascist model.
[06:37:21.341 --> 06:37:36.168]  My issue is, is that, you look at the Democratic Party, they're just telling me how beautiful abortion is all day, and how horrible the ugly the family is, and how great GMO is all day.
[06:37:36.568 --> 06:37:38.789]  So I just am not really into that group of people.
[06:37:39.089 --> 06:37:41.330]  Just like I'm not into the Republicans.
[06:37:41.530 --> 06:37:45.192]  The decisive issue right now, the life and death kitchen table issue,
[06:37:45.652 --> 06:37:58.063]  With mass traction is economic survival of the middle class and above all of the 50 million who have no job, they have no welfare, they have no unemployment benefit, they have no health care, they're living on food stamps.
[06:37:58.564 --> 06:38:02.327]  And we had a candidate, Ron Paul, who said cut food stamps by 63%.
[06:38:03.648 --> 06:38:05.190]  And that is just disgraceful.
[06:38:05.530 --> 06:38:07.812]  That's anti-American.
[06:38:08.132 --> 06:38:10.735]  It's an abomination in the eyes of God.
[06:38:11.255 --> 06:38:11.835]  We're good.
[06:38:32.206 --> 06:38:33.126]  I don't know what.
[06:38:33.287 --> 06:38:36.628]  And they've never really been able to bounce back.
[06:38:36.748 --> 06:38:40.209]  And part of it is this idea that Romney is somehow benign.
[06:38:40.709 --> 06:38:43.610]  Romney is the face of Wall Street.
[06:38:43.650 --> 06:38:44.250]  No, we don't.
[06:38:44.450 --> 06:38:46.111]  Listen, people don't think it's benign.
[06:38:46.151 --> 06:38:54.694]  Listen, Webster, to be fair intellectually, there's the argument that collectivism has developed some of the biggest nightmares we've seen.
[06:38:55.114 --> 06:38:56.535]  But where do we see collectivism?
[06:38:56.955 --> 06:38:57.915]  Where's collectivism?
[06:38:58.815 --> 06:39:00.096]  Who represents collectivism?
[06:39:01.122 --> 06:39:01.762]  The Soviets?
[06:39:01.782 --> 06:39:05.164]  Yeah, I know, but this is all long gone.
[06:39:05.184 --> 06:39:06.284]  Now, Nazis?
[06:39:06.684 --> 06:39:08.965]  In the United States today, where is it?
[06:39:10.266 --> 06:39:22.571]  Man, all I know is a bunch of government bureaucrats deciding who eats and who dies is not a good idea, but... But let me put it the other way, since you brought up the Nazis, look, if you look at Romney and that permanent dictatorship that I talked about,
[06:39:23.388 --> 06:39:35.237]  If you look at Hitler and Mussolini, the common thing with Hitler and Mussolini is once they have power, they destroy all unions and they impose an austerity of about 40 to 50 to 60 percent.
[06:39:37.893 --> 06:39:42.496]  Now, you look at large parts of the Republican Party, want to do that, right?
[06:39:42.536 --> 06:39:49.281]  They want to destroy the unions, and they want, I would say Romney was offering about 30% austerity for starters.
[06:39:49.801 --> 06:40:06.793]  The other thing in the United States is, if you are a racist, if you are anti-foreigner, and all the rest of this, then you begin to have a race theory, and with that, and then if you try to... Hey Webster, how about Hispanic American kids can't wear American flags in San Francisco?
[06:40:08.070 --> 06:40:08.831]  What is this?
[06:40:09.472 --> 06:40:12.217]  These are cultural populist wedge issues!
[06:40:12.778 --> 06:40:14.801]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[06:40:14.841 --> 06:40:16.524]  You're giving me the romantic...
[06:40:19.440 --> 06:40:39.536]  Divide and Conquer, Liberation Theology, Ford Foundation, about people that don't want to get rid of their sovereignty when the UN and the globalists want to get rid of borders, not to empower people coming in, but to use them as political weapons to bring in what the bankers fund is a fake collectivism.
[06:40:39.556 --> 06:40:40.476]  But let's just stop there.
[06:40:40.937 --> 06:40:42.278]  I don't want to argue with you tonight.
[06:40:42.618 --> 06:40:44.600]  Let me pose a few questions here.
[06:40:44.620 --> 06:40:46.781]  We're coming to the end here.
[06:40:47.882 --> 06:40:57.311]  I really want to get your take on where you see the world financial meltdown going versus where you'd like it to go, because I think you're a good guy.
[06:40:57.331 --> 06:40:58.172]  I don't think you're a bad guy.
[06:40:58.292 --> 06:40:59.133]  I want your perspective.
[06:40:59.473 --> 06:40:59.994]  That's why you're here.
[06:41:00.014 --> 06:41:00.894]  Let's just stop fighting.
[06:41:01.895 --> 06:41:02.176]  Hold on.
[06:41:02.196 --> 06:41:03.116]  I want your take on that.
[06:41:03.797 --> 06:41:16.995]  And then Benghazi, because, you know, you and Pachinik got on here, and both of you on the same day, you didn't know you were on together, but you were on together, said that this was a neocon coup to make Obama look bad.
[06:41:17.076 --> 06:41:19.519]  And I was like, okay, maybe that's... Yeah, the Mormon Mafia coup.
[06:41:19.539 --> 06:41:20.540]  The Mormon Mafia, of course.
[06:41:21.181 --> 06:41:23.323]  Uh, and I said, okay, maybe that's true.
[06:41:23.903 --> 06:41:31.848]  Now it's, they admit that Obama for five to seven hours knew they had feeds of all this and stood down.
[06:41:31.948 --> 06:41:42.535]  So how does the Mormon mafia operating from Kolob or whatever, how do they, how do they make, uh, up there?
[06:41:42.635 --> 06:41:48.038]  How do they make, um, Obama have all that stand down?
[06:41:48.058 --> 06:41:50.040]  And then why did Obama play into all of it?
[06:41:50.840 --> 06:41:57.104]  I don't know exactly what you're referring to, that Obama has been proven to know something, and what's the documentation on that?
[06:41:57.404 --> 06:42:09.571]  Here's what I know, is that Fox News reported, what, 10-12 days ago, that the CIA command structure itself told those CIA guys to stand down.
[06:42:09.631 --> 06:42:17.155]  So we've got 12 CIA at this annex, they're special forces, they could make a military difference,
[06:42:17.822 --> 06:42:20.703]  The guy attacking is Cuomo, he's a CIA asset.
[06:42:21.163 --> 06:42:24.584]  The other CIA asset is the 17th of February Martyrs Brigade.
[06:42:25.064 --> 06:42:26.184]  They don't do anything.
[06:42:26.224 --> 06:42:33.726]  So it comes down to these CIA people, and they get a formal order to stand down.
[06:42:34.146 --> 06:42:36.867]  And that comes from the CIA command structure.
[06:42:37.347 --> 06:42:45.989]  Now look, unless you want to join Lyndon LaRouche out there in, you know, what can I say, the Amen Corner for Langley,
[06:42:47.085 --> 06:42:51.747]  The people who are responsible, Hillary Clinton is responsible for the State Department.
[06:42:52.048 --> 06:42:56.590]  She has ministerial responsibility for what goes on in the State Department.
[06:42:56.950 --> 06:43:01.212]  This consulate seems more and more to represent a CIA post.
[06:43:01.632 --> 06:43:02.293]  In this case,
[06:43:02.953 --> 06:43:10.099]  The guy that you haven't heard of, General David Petraeus, becomes the obvious person who needs to resign.
[06:43:10.839 --> 06:43:11.680]  Either one or the other.
[06:43:11.700 --> 06:43:16.384]  It's either Petraeus or Hillary, or both, or a mixture of the two.
[06:43:16.624 --> 06:43:17.945]  Yes, both should resign.
[06:43:18.245 --> 06:43:20.087]  But I don't see how you get this
[06:43:20.788 --> 06:43:25.914]  To the White House, in the sense that there's some, there's some huge conspiracy.
[06:43:26.335 --> 06:43:34.024]  I saw, there was a press conference here at the Press Club on Friday, and one of these characters was saying, oh Obama's got impeachable crimes.
[06:43:34.344 --> 06:43:38.770]  They could not cite an impeachable crime except the bombing of Libya, and that took place.
[06:43:39.350 --> 06:43:40.030]  Last year.
[06:43:40.130 --> 06:43:41.531]  So, I just don't see that.
[06:43:41.591 --> 06:43:46.532]  What I see is the CIA Mormon Mafia doing what it could to get Romney elected.
[06:43:46.592 --> 06:43:53.733]  Now, getting Romney elected is not easy, because he's probably the worst candidate we've seen in many, many cycles, right?
[06:43:53.773 --> 06:43:54.514]  He's rich.
[06:43:54.894 --> 06:43:55.994]  He's got horses.
[06:43:56.054 --> 06:43:57.134]  He's got this wife.
[06:43:57.594 --> 06:43:59.555]  He's out of touch, right?
[06:43:59.575 --> 06:43:59.955]  He's so
[06:44:00.896 --> 06:44:03.679]  He's so rich, it's like he lives on Kolob, right?
[06:44:03.719 --> 06:44:06.081]  With a quarter billion dollars in the bank.
[06:44:06.141 --> 06:44:10.827]  It's just been found, by the way, that he was scamming through the Netherlands.
[06:44:11.227 --> 06:44:15.252]  It's called the double Irish with a Dutch sandwich.
[06:44:15.812 --> 06:44:21.177]  So, you invest in Ireland and then you recycle the money through Holland twice.
[06:44:21.657 --> 06:44:22.878]  And Romney was doing that.
[06:44:23.258 --> 06:44:25.260]  So he's got every tax scam in the book.
[06:44:25.300 --> 06:44:29.023]  And this is why he wouldn't reveal his tax return.
[06:44:29.083 --> 06:44:33.306]  So, I don't see how you get from all of this to Obama.
[06:44:33.466 --> 06:44:35.308]  This is directed against Obama.
[06:44:35.348 --> 06:44:40.332]  Now, you might say, why doesn't Obama come out and say this is the CIA Mormon Mafia?
[06:44:40.372 --> 06:44:41.673]  Well, because he's a coward.
[06:44:41.953 --> 06:44:42.834]  Because he's a puppet.
[06:44:43.174 --> 06:44:44.155]  Because he's Obama.
[06:44:44.255 --> 06:44:45.036]  All the things we know.
[06:44:45.635 --> 06:44:48.817]  Now you were asking about the perspective for the world financial system.
[06:44:48.857 --> 06:44:50.858]  Now here's the other thing that people have got to understand.
[06:44:51.818 --> 06:45:03.744]  The banking community can always keep a bubble going, and they can always prop up zombie banks, as long as they can't impose the austerity they want.
[06:45:04.084 --> 06:45:13.449]  Because when they take that austerity, that's like taking the real economy and people's standards of living, their very lives, their very body, and squeeze it like a lemon.
[06:45:14.128 --> 06:45:17.789]  And what comes out can be used to prop up the system.
[06:45:17.869 --> 06:45:36.295]  So, you have to say, as long as austerity is not broken, there is a very significant capability of the ruling class to keep these derivatives structures and other fictitious capital structures going.
[06:45:36.355 --> 06:45:39.056]  So, you have to look at both sides of that equation.
[06:45:39.296 --> 06:45:40.977]  There's a class struggle element,
[06:45:41.557 --> 06:45:55.071]  If the bankers are winning, if they're smashing labor, they're wiping out unions, lowering wages, cutting social services, all the things they've been doing in Greece and Spain and Britain and elsewhere, that's what they want to bring here.
[06:45:55.471 --> 06:45:58.214]  And if they can do that, they can go on for a while longer.
[06:45:58.314 --> 06:45:58.835]  Ultimately,
[06:45:59.455 --> 06:46:04.039]  The logic leads to concentration camp economics, but of course we have that too.
[06:46:04.379 --> 06:46:17.810]  We have the prison industrial complex, we've got all kinds of people, especially black, hispanic, poor, Appalachian, whatever, all in jail and they're getting put through the meat grinder of the prison industrial complex.
[06:46:17.850 --> 06:46:25.536]  But the main thing is, there are no financial deadlines, except the ones that are imposed by
[06:46:27.686 --> 06:46:32.309]  Well, by a mass movement putting a stop to the primitive accumulation and the looting.
[06:46:32.950 --> 06:46:39.074]  So, obviously, you know, we're always skating along the brink of a financial collapse, but I wouldn't look at that so much.
[06:46:39.114 --> 06:46:40.675]  And again, I think this is really important.
[06:46:41.075 --> 06:46:49.461]  The thing that should concern us are the 30 million plus unemployed in this country, 40 million plus in Europe, similarly around the world.
[06:46:49.761 --> 06:46:50.702]  That's the depression.
[06:46:51.326 --> 06:46:57.470]  And the only way to deal with that is to get out of the depression, and this requires real economic remedies, right?
[06:46:57.770 --> 06:47:04.955]  It requires the closing of the zombie banks, you know, the cancellation of most derivatives, right?
[06:47:04.995 --> 06:47:16.223]  Most derivatives should be shredded, deleted, the derivatives should be outlawed, many of them, the collateralized debt obligations, the credit default swaps, various energy derivatives, that's what's driving up
[06:47:16.800 --> 06:47:17.921]  The price of gasoline.
[06:47:18.421 --> 06:47:19.141]  So that's all there.
[06:47:19.181 --> 06:47:22.703]  But the main thing is, get control of the Federal Reserve, right?
[06:47:22.723 --> 06:47:28.346]  We can say nationalize it, seize it, deprivatize it, because it's already been privatized.
[06:47:28.806 --> 06:47:33.969]  Get it back out of the control of the clique of bankers, and put it out in the sunlight.
[06:47:34.849 --> 06:47:39.431]  And this can be done, again, right now, it can be done by a mass movement.
[06:47:39.451 --> 06:47:44.234]  In other words, if you don't like what you're getting, get out there and say, the Federal Reserve...
[06:47:45.094 --> 06:47:49.318]  Okay, that said, what do you expect now to really come out of this?
[06:47:49.358 --> 06:47:50.600]  We've talked about what they're planning.
[06:47:51.080 --> 06:47:52.502]  What about geopolitically?
[06:47:52.522 --> 06:47:53.903]  This is my perspective.
[06:47:53.943 --> 06:47:54.684]  It goes like this.
[06:47:55.625 --> 06:47:59.749]  Now that we have the Republican Party defeated,
[06:48:00.535 --> 06:48:04.319]  And this is a, it's an unbelievable zoo, the Republican Party.
[06:48:04.359 --> 06:48:05.620]  I mean, you look at these people.
[06:48:05.921 --> 06:48:07.903]  This was absolutely off the wall, right?
[06:48:07.943 --> 06:48:11.166]  We had Murdoch the Morlock, we had Aiken, right?
[06:48:11.646 --> 06:48:15.250]  These people, they're out of some kind of a horror comic book.
[06:48:15.993 --> 06:48:17.914]  This has now been defeated for the moment.
[06:48:18.014 --> 06:48:22.217]  I expect that the Republicans will now tie each other up in knots for quite a while.
[06:48:22.257 --> 06:48:28.561]  They'll say, you weren't fascist enough, you should have been more anti-immigrant, or you weren't racist enough.
[06:48:28.962 --> 06:48:29.662]  Let them do that.
[06:48:29.942 --> 06:48:39.889]  Some of them are already saying that they needed a real Tea Party presidential candidate, right, a real lunatic, right, as presidential candidate.
[06:48:40.309 --> 06:48:41.210]  Then they'd do better.
[06:48:41.250 --> 06:48:45.613]  Hey, Webster, I mean, that's all MSNBC does is push race stuff all day.
[06:48:46.193 --> 06:48:47.355]  Yeah, but come on, come on.
[06:48:47.996 --> 06:48:53.083]  Look, the whole voting pattern, the voter suppression, voter suppression, right?
[06:48:53.103 --> 06:48:54.505]  You should be concerned about this.
[06:48:54.946 --> 06:48:57.089]  They try to take the right to vote away from who?
[06:48:57.169 --> 06:49:00.234]  Black, Hispanic, old, young, and poor.
[06:49:00.394 --> 06:49:00.654]  Really?
[06:49:00.734 --> 06:49:01.896]  What's the proof of that?
[06:49:02.765 --> 06:49:05.908]  That's what, that's, did you see the lines in Ohio?
[06:49:06.148 --> 06:49:08.070]  Did you see the lines in Florida?
[06:49:08.550 --> 06:49:12.874]  They had lines in like wealthy areas of Austin today.
[06:49:12.914 --> 06:49:14.115]  I mean, is it really?
[06:49:14.535 --> 06:49:16.957]  Uh, anyway, again, it's all a matter of, uh.
[06:49:17.298 --> 06:49:17.898]  Are they really?
[06:49:17.998 --> 06:49:20.601]  Okay, I'll just, just, just count whatever you say.
[06:49:21.755 --> 06:49:22.235]  Yeah, come on.
[06:49:23.296 --> 06:49:31.120]  To argue that it's typical of rich areas to have weight-long lines, I think is simply flying in the face of reality.
[06:49:31.361 --> 06:49:33.702]  Anyway, what's going to happen with the Democrats now?
[06:49:33.722 --> 06:49:34.663]  This is the interesting part.
[06:49:35.183 --> 06:49:39.525]  What I hope will happen with the Democrats is that they'll split into two parts.
[06:49:40.366 --> 06:49:48.330]  One is the Wall Street Democrats, with Obama, and with Schumer, and with Durbin, and with so many of them.
[06:49:48.571 --> 06:49:50.932]  You know, Pelosi and her husband.
[06:49:51.624 --> 06:49:57.530]  But on the other side now, we got the beginning of some kind of populist ferment.
[06:49:57.670 --> 06:49:58.931]  Something's happening, right?
[06:49:59.371 --> 06:50:02.815]  Elizabeth Warren, as I call her, Ms.
[06:50:02.935 --> 06:50:05.697]  Prim, she still succeeded in winning the Senate.
[06:50:05.938 --> 06:50:09.921]  This was the most outspoken anti-Wall Street candidate, so that's something.
[06:50:10.502 --> 06:50:15.707]  Then we got Sherrod Brown in Ohio, populist, blue collar,
[06:50:16.624 --> 06:50:17.244]  Pro-Union.
[06:50:17.585 --> 06:50:21.447]  Marcy Kaptur in Ohio, Defazio, bunch of others.
[06:50:21.827 --> 06:50:34.114]  That could be a split or at least a faction of the Democratic Party that would split from Obama, especially now because Obama will come with the grand bargain
[06:50:35.276 --> 06:50:36.997]  Killer austerity against the American people.
[06:50:37.017 --> 06:50:54.687]  Sure, I'd get all that to pay the bankers money, but Webster, the unions, where there are good ideas to counterbalance against the robber barons, you know, a hundred years ago, it could be a good idea today, they're a bunch of globalists arguing to ship jobs overseas and take my guns.
[06:50:56.308 --> 06:50:58.309]  Well, why don't we... No, I mean, I see what they put out.
[06:50:58.349 --> 06:50:59.610]  You laugh, and that's what they do.
[06:50:59.870 --> 06:51:02.771]  I'm afraid it gets us away from reality.
[06:51:03.091 --> 06:51:07.514]  I would say the main thing is you want to promote fighting among these groups.
[06:51:07.694 --> 06:51:10.975]  In other words, as you know, I subscribe to Machiavelli's discourses.
[06:51:11.295 --> 06:51:12.436]  No, no, no, I mean, I agree.
[06:51:12.456 --> 06:51:14.137]  We want gridlock.
[06:51:14.257 --> 06:51:15.057]  We want gridlock.
[06:51:15.097 --> 06:51:16.598]  We want divided government.
[06:51:16.918 --> 06:51:24.242]  If we had had Romney tonight, we probably would have had a Republican Senate and a Republican House, and that would be back to Bush.
[06:51:25.003 --> 06:51:28.466]  Number one... Sure, by the way, you're not saying this is a landslide, right?
[06:51:28.526 --> 06:51:32.569]  I mean, Obama has exactly one-third more than, um...
[06:51:35.777 --> 06:51:38.099]  Romney, it is 60-40 right now.
[06:51:38.580 --> 06:51:45.866]  The Electoral College is designed to magnify a very small lead in the popular vote and make that look impressive.
[06:51:46.306 --> 06:51:51.991]  It's one of the stable features of the Electoral College, but it's also an optical illusion, right?
[06:51:52.452 --> 06:51:58.657]  Because if you go back and figure how many, if you transferred how many votes, right?
[06:52:00.241 --> 06:52:06.884]  100,000, 200,000, probably the real margin for Romney is certainly less than half a million votes out of quite a few votes.
[06:52:07.304 --> 06:52:09.985]  So, and of course, we'd also have to see the turnout.
[06:52:10.385 --> 06:52:17.487]  They say the turnout is higher, but I'd like to see what the turnout... No, no, I get it magnifies it, but I've seen other elections.
[06:52:17.507 --> 06:52:19.088]  This is a big electoral win.
[06:52:20.369 --> 06:52:27.215]  Again, look at Bush, the elder, got something like 425, 435 electoral votes, and even that was hardly a landslide.
[06:52:27.235 --> 06:52:29.116]  Landslide is Roosevelt 1936 and Johnson 1964.
[06:52:29.196 --> 06:52:29.917]  Anyway, the point of this is,
[06:52:40.942 --> 06:52:43.684]  The Republican Party, I think, is now going to dwindle.
[06:52:44.084 --> 06:52:45.665]  They're going to become more extreme.
[06:52:46.025 --> 06:52:47.466]  They're going to do everything wrong.
[06:52:47.826 --> 06:52:48.547]  They're going to dwindle.
[06:52:48.587 --> 06:52:52.329]  They're going to become a party, a regional party, in the Deep South.
[06:52:52.789 --> 06:52:56.231]  And that will then explode the contradictions of the Democratic Party.
[06:52:56.692 --> 06:53:10.380]  And the thing to do is to try to favor this kind of a differentiation between the Obama-Wall Street Democrats and try to revive some kind of New Deal Democrat, which I'm doing from the outside, right?
[06:53:11.067 --> 06:53:13.029]  Aren't you going to ask me who I voted for, Alex?
[06:53:13.889 --> 06:53:15.410]  We know who you voted for, Lord.
[06:53:15.430 --> 06:53:17.732]  I voted for the Green Party, and I'll tell you why.
[06:53:18.233 --> 06:53:20.534]  The Green Party, because of Sherry Hunkala.
[06:53:20.875 --> 06:53:27.520]  I don't know anything about the Green Party presidential candidate, but Sherry Hunkala is a fighter.
[06:53:28.000 --> 06:53:31.943]  Out of all the people on the ballot, the only one I could tell you is actually a fighter.
[06:53:32.023 --> 06:53:33.344]  Somebody who has done a public service.
[06:53:33.764 --> 06:53:39.689]  She ran last year for Sheriff of Philadelphia, and she said, elect me Sheriff of Philadelphia,
[06:53:40.310 --> 06:53:43.852]  Foreclosures will stop, because I won't carry them out.
[06:53:44.233 --> 06:53:45.173]  Now, there's a fighter.
[06:53:45.473 --> 06:53:46.634]  That's the spirit we need.
[06:53:47.315 --> 06:53:51.337]  Make those Wall Street bums pay for the depression they caused.
[06:53:51.598 --> 06:53:56.481]  Let them eat the losses on these foreclosures, but American people stay in their house.
[06:53:56.721 --> 06:53:59.723]  Because you have a right to a house, and a right to healthcare, right?
[06:54:00.063 --> 06:54:05.687]  We have a whole series of rights in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Economic Bill of Rights, and we want our rights.
[06:54:06.374 --> 06:54:11.456]  And I think, again, the chances of that are somewhat better tonight than... I mean, here's the problem.
[06:54:12.356 --> 06:54:21.239]  Soviet Russia, North Korea, I mean, all these places, it creates hell on earth when you get a bunch of people together saying, give us our piece of the pie.
[06:54:21.259 --> 06:54:24.800]  I mean, what we need... Oh, that's the Republican Party.
[06:54:25.040 --> 06:54:26.801]  That's, you know...
[06:54:28.590 --> 06:54:34.172]  Jack Abramoff, Jack Abramoff, Grover Norquist, and the rest of them say we want our piece of the pie.
[06:54:34.433 --> 06:54:36.113]  And Rand Paul is in there too.
[06:54:36.313 --> 06:54:37.674]  He wants his piece of the pie.
[06:54:39.315 --> 06:54:41.055]  No, I understand all that.
[06:54:41.095 --> 06:54:44.617]  So Tarbley, you really believe government and a big state is going to deliver?
[06:54:44.957 --> 06:54:47.358]  I believe mass movement is necessary.
[06:54:47.498 --> 06:54:50.739]  I say nothing works without a mass movement.
[06:54:51.200 --> 06:54:53.521]  And it's got to be a populist mass movement.
[06:54:54.001 --> 06:54:56.842]  Anti-Wall Street, anti-Federal Reserve,
[06:54:58.034 --> 06:54:59.616]  Anti-party, to be sure.
[06:55:00.156 --> 06:55:01.418]  But we need a mass movement.
[06:55:01.658 --> 06:55:06.502]  The only conceivable way to get a mass movement is on the economic issues that I've said.
[06:55:06.683 --> 06:55:07.223]  Alright, listen.
[06:55:07.604 --> 06:55:09.465]  Listen, we've gone for 45 minutes.
[06:55:09.505 --> 06:55:17.353]  We're almost out of time and I promise to go to Noel, Nick, Lewis and Lester to close this out and to get a final report from Jakari Jackson.
[06:55:17.393 --> 06:55:20.055]  Is Jakari still over there waiting for us to go to him?
[06:55:20.896 --> 06:55:25.880]  Let's go to a quick break with some latest election numbers from Jakari Jackson for about five minutes.
[06:55:25.920 --> 06:55:28.441]  Webster, you can cool your heels there for a minute.
[06:55:28.902 --> 06:55:35.346]  I want to come back and really get your view on geopolitically where things are going versus the
[06:55:37.091 --> 06:55:38.572]  Utopias that we were discussing.
[06:55:52.159 --> 06:55:56.982]  Okay, and we'll get Jakari's quick final update here on some of the numbers coming in.
[06:55:57.402 --> 06:56:08.408]  Victorious leader, Obama, he actually runs things, he actually writes the legislation, he actually fought the NDAA and is against lobbyists, and closed Gitmo and ended all the wars and is a peace man of peace.
[06:56:09.209 --> 06:56:12.310]  Jakari Jackson, I'm sorry, Tarbley, you had something to say?
[06:56:13.191 --> 06:56:14.932]  I said, I don't know what you're trying to tell me.
[06:56:15.032 --> 06:56:16.933]  I'm for the United Front Against Austerity.
[06:56:18.268 --> 06:56:18.989]  United Front.
[06:56:20.250 --> 06:56:24.354]  We're going to go back to you in a minute, but Tarpley, let's go to Ja'Kari Jackson.
[06:56:24.394 --> 06:56:24.814]  Ja'Kari.
[06:56:24.834 --> 06:56:28.918]  Hey Alex, great interview with Tarpley as always.
[06:56:28.958 --> 06:56:32.081]  If we can pull up the last poll numbers here, we'll take a look.
[06:56:32.640 --> 06:56:34.522]  Okay, so we see it hasn't changed.
[06:56:34.542 --> 06:56:37.844]  Well, actually, Romney has bumped up another 3% to 2.06.
[06:56:38.885 --> 06:56:43.549]  And Obama is strong with the 3.03, so there it is right there.
[06:56:44.189 --> 06:56:47.492]  Obama, your next president, you can see the map right there.
[06:56:48.472 --> 06:56:49.713]  Is Florida still undecided?
[06:56:49.733 --> 06:56:50.174]  What is that?
[06:56:51.355 --> 06:56:58.080]  Okay, so it looks like Florida is still undecided, but largely, and also, what is it, Alaska as well.
[06:56:59.080 --> 06:57:00.902]  But largely, it looks like it's gonna be Obama.
[06:57:01.182 --> 06:57:02.143]  So that's your-
[06:57:02.802 --> 06:57:04.363]  You're president for the next four years.
[06:57:04.463 --> 06:57:05.223]  Love it or hate it.
[06:57:06.043 --> 06:57:15.667]  And afterwards, I do believe, after the Webster Tarpley interview, we will have a brief roundtable discussion with myself, Melissa Melton, David Ortiz, and Aaron Dykes.
[06:57:16.047 --> 06:57:19.389]  So stay tuned after the Webster Tarpley interview for that.
[06:57:19.449 --> 06:57:20.789]  And you can see Melissa's right here.
[06:57:21.370 --> 06:57:23.190]  I guess we can get a quick update since you're here.
[06:57:23.230 --> 06:57:24.811]  Melissa, how was it out on the street?
[06:57:26.136 --> 06:57:26.677]  Oh, wow.
[06:57:27.617 --> 06:57:30.880]  Well, a lot of people were largely in support of Obama.
[06:57:30.920 --> 06:57:35.685]  They couldn't tell me why they supported Obama, but there was a lot of people in support of Obama, pretty much.
[06:57:36.045 --> 06:57:36.846]  That's what I saw.
[06:57:37.306 --> 06:57:40.529]  Okay, and you also streamed some live videos to JustinTV?
[06:57:41.009 --> 06:57:43.191]  I did stream a few live videos to JustinTV.
[06:57:44.632 --> 06:57:54.304]  Basically, I tried to ask Obama supporters if they could list five things they thought Obama did well, and then I realized that was too many things, so then I asked if they could list one thing.
[06:57:54.905 --> 06:57:55.766]  That got interesting.
[06:57:55.806 --> 06:58:02.414]  I couldn't really get a whole lot of straight answers, and the things that they did tell me were things that I would not expect, like he decreased piracy.
[06:58:04.156 --> 06:58:11.062]  I don't know if it's actual pirates that he decreased, or he decreased DVDs being illegally burned.
[06:58:11.082 --> 06:58:15.425]  I'm not really sure, but apparently that was a major concern.
[06:58:15.445 --> 06:58:19.709]  Hey, Obama took out the Easter Bunny in that Navy SEAL raid.
[06:58:20.650 --> 06:58:23.092]  Obama took out the Easter Bunny, okay?
[06:58:23.472 --> 06:58:26.295]  And maybe they got the Keebler elf as well.
[06:58:26.835 --> 06:58:30.178]  And you said you actually got in an argument with somebody on the street?
[06:58:30.858 --> 06:58:37.621]  Yeah, I had one guy tell me that Obama was wonderful because he did the auto bailout.
[06:58:38.201 --> 06:58:42.643]  But then later on, he told me he was really good because he didn't give bailouts to corrupt corporations.
[06:58:43.663 --> 06:58:49.345]  And I said, well, what about the fact that GM actually used the auto bailout to ship our jobs overseas to China?
[06:58:49.385 --> 06:58:50.966]  How does that factor in?
[06:58:51.446 --> 06:58:53.847]  And when I asked him that, he said, based on what?
[06:58:54.567 --> 06:58:58.148]  I said, based on that's what happened, Google it.
[06:58:58.188 --> 06:58:59.589]  He's like, you Google it.
[06:59:00.730 --> 06:59:03.132]  If I had a computer, I would, sir, but I don't.
[06:59:03.252 --> 06:59:04.453]  So, but it happened.
[06:59:04.774 --> 06:59:08.257]  Well, they think if you're talking about Obama, you support Romney.
[06:59:08.277 --> 06:59:12.040]  They don't get that you don't want to go with either ridiculous New World Order group.
[06:59:12.060 --> 06:59:17.085]  We're going to go back to you guys in about five, six minutes, and also hit a few phone calls for folks that are holding.
[06:59:17.566 --> 06:59:20.308]  But I take us now back to the illustrious
[06:59:22.089 --> 06:59:27.991]  The Grand Poobah himself from Klandathu.
[06:59:29.092 --> 06:59:33.133]  He joins us, Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[06:59:33.153 --> 06:59:34.333]  Alright Webster.
[06:59:34.553 --> 06:59:36.674]  Alex, can I just ask your people there.
[06:59:37.914 --> 06:59:40.535]  Texas went for Romney as far as I know.
[06:59:40.575 --> 06:59:43.456]  Did you ask any leading questions about Romney?
[06:59:43.476 --> 06:59:45.417]  Did they have anything positive about Romney?
[06:59:47.003 --> 06:59:48.224]  Melissa?
[06:59:48.844 --> 06:59:58.169]  The best I could get out of anybody who supported Romney was that he was for less government, but they couldn't explain to me exactly how that was.
[06:59:58.189 --> 07:00:00.891]  No, no, Webster was implying that we were being partisan.
[07:00:00.911 --> 07:00:06.053]  He doesn't understand we're in Austin and that there weren't a lot of Romney supporters.
[07:00:06.093 --> 07:00:09.635]  Concerning the bailouts, I think... No, the Koch brothers were giving us orders.
[07:00:09.996 --> 07:00:13.217]  You want a bailout, Otto, but you don't want to bail out banks.
[07:00:13.337 --> 07:00:14.838]  I think that makes perfect sense.
[07:00:15.018 --> 07:00:16.259]  That's what the guy's trying to say.
[07:00:17.786 --> 07:00:18.607]  Bail out auto.
[07:00:18.988 --> 07:00:20.950]  Obama good, Romney bad.
[07:00:21.010 --> 07:00:22.872]  Don't get in the way of Tarpley savoring.
[07:00:23.192 --> 07:00:24.294]  What are you talking about?
[07:00:24.894 --> 07:00:30.561]  Now, since this is our chance to speak directly to Mr. Tarpley, I just wanted to know if he could do the impression.
[07:00:30.601 --> 07:00:31.161]  No, I'm not.
[07:00:31.222 --> 07:00:33.424]  I'm just not embracing linen here tonight.
[07:00:33.885 --> 07:00:36.908]  Listen, Webster, do we have the YouTube of Webster ready?
[07:00:36.988 --> 07:00:40.749]  Hold on, I'm going to play a clip here real quick before I go back to Webster.
[07:00:41.049 --> 07:00:44.110]  We're going to come back to Chikari and Melissa Melton and the roundtable.
[07:00:44.791 --> 07:00:49.412]  Here in just a moment, here tonight, I've been on the air more than 10 hours today, so I'm a little bit dingy.
[07:00:50.072 --> 07:00:52.853]  And I'm quite intimidated actually just looking at Tarbley.
[07:00:52.873 --> 07:00:54.774]  I feel like I'm in a James Bond movie right now.
[07:00:55.354 --> 07:00:57.215]  Like going, hello Scepter 12.
[07:00:57.335 --> 07:01:00.816]  We are preparing to energize the moonbeam.
[07:01:01.576 --> 07:01:05.437]  And then Webster says, ah, yes, look at him right there.
[07:01:05.938 --> 07:01:08.339]  Anyways, it's ridiculous.
[07:01:08.359 --> 07:01:10.319]  That's the fun part about doing this show.
[07:01:10.399 --> 07:01:12.180]  I get to know all these funny, interesting people.
[07:01:12.900 --> 07:01:14.821]  Ladies and gentlemen, hold on, Tarpley.
[07:01:14.861 --> 07:01:16.122]  Hold on, Tarpley.
[07:01:16.842 --> 07:01:17.762]  Oh, my God.
[07:01:18.442 --> 07:01:19.203]  Here is Tarpley.
[07:01:19.243 --> 07:01:19.623]  Here we go.
[07:01:22.088 --> 07:01:23.869]  He called!
[07:01:23.909 --> 07:01:24.630]  He called!
[07:01:24.730 --> 07:01:28.231]  A friend with weed is a friend indeed, but a friend with gold is the best I'm told.
[07:01:28.292 --> 07:01:30.533]  Ron Paul's program in synthesis.
[07:01:30.973 --> 07:01:32.734]  So he's a devil weed dealer.
[07:01:34.079 --> 07:01:35.481]  Well, draw your own conclusions.
[07:01:35.561 --> 07:01:36.642]  If the shoe fits, wear it.
[07:01:37.103 --> 07:01:38.905]  So what did you watch, Leprechaun 5?
[07:01:40.326 --> 07:01:41.908]  Lep in the hood, out to do no good.
[07:01:42.168 --> 07:01:43.550]  Yes, words to live by.
[07:01:43.570 --> 07:01:47.274]  So watch out for somebody who is promising gold.
[07:01:47.434 --> 07:01:52.720]  Webster Givis, tell us how you learned Leprechaun's secret powers.
[07:01:52.921 --> 07:01:54.542]  Actually, I wrote the script.
[07:01:55.183 --> 07:01:58.066]  Hold on guys, we're doing a deep interview.
[07:01:58.286 --> 07:02:01.529]  I love the Italian guy that's withing the Italian government officials.
[07:02:01.649 --> 07:02:02.590]  He ripped the script!
[07:02:03.191 --> 07:02:04.752]  By the way, people thought I was drunk there.
[07:02:04.772 --> 07:02:06.334]  I had had like two glasses of wine, but that wasn't.
[07:02:06.374 --> 07:02:09.217]  I've been bullhorning like eight hours at Bilderberg.
[07:02:09.237 --> 07:02:10.338]  But Tarbly, wait!
[07:02:10.918 --> 07:02:11.839]  Oh illustrious one.
[07:02:13.661 --> 07:02:18.184]  I'm going to give you the floor here to describe to us how you wrote Leprechaun 5.
[07:02:18.464 --> 07:02:20.885]  Now seriously, geopolitically, where do you see things going?
[07:02:21.346 --> 07:02:25.068]  What do you think about Hillary saying we've got to invade Syria because Al Qaeda is there?
[07:02:25.088 --> 07:02:31.352]  I mean, all these big developments that have happened lately, other stuff rather than the savoring the defeat of Romney.
[07:02:32.952 --> 07:02:40.317]  I think important is in Syria, as far as I can see, the Syrian army has defeated the death squads.
[07:02:40.871 --> 07:02:42.392]  To a very significant degree.
[07:02:42.432 --> 07:02:46.974]  The Syrian rebels, the death squads, they are militarily in very bad shape.
[07:02:47.534 --> 07:02:51.215]  I don't see them able to hold parts of cities anymore.
[07:02:51.235 --> 07:02:58.959]  I don't see them able to hold parts of the countryside, even in northern Syria, even fairly near the Turkish border.
[07:02:59.499 --> 07:03:04.441]  They're reduced now to political assassinations of generals and officials.
[07:03:05.143 --> 07:03:10.727]  They can do low to medium-grade terrorism pretty much every day.
[07:03:10.747 --> 07:03:16.712]  They can do large-scale terrorism with car bombs and things that they've done lately.
[07:03:17.212 --> 07:03:29.481]  But the Syrian rebels would appear to be defeated militarily and I think also they're defeated politically in the sense that the Syrian National Council
[07:03:30.814 --> 07:03:34.475]  Supported by the U.S., the French and others, is a laughing stock.
[07:03:34.855 --> 07:03:37.535]  It is so discredited that the U.S.
[07:03:37.615 --> 07:03:42.296]  is now in the process of dumping the Syrian National Council.
[07:03:42.336 --> 07:03:46.797]  Those people, that was that woman who came to the Bilderberg, right?
[07:03:46.817 --> 07:03:49.818]  We saw her through the window of her car there.
[07:03:50.178 --> 07:03:51.878]  She was the Syrian National Council.
[07:03:52.178 --> 07:03:56.299]  Those people only wanted to live in hotels and, you know, jet around the world.
[07:03:57.099 --> 07:03:57.860]  The U.S.
[07:03:58.100 --> 07:04:07.512]  now, in a day or two, in Qatar, Hillary Clinton is organizing a new meeting of the Syrian puppets.
[07:04:08.033 --> 07:04:11.918]  Of political puppets, and indeed, Al-Qaeda types.
[07:04:11.958 --> 07:04:13.059]  There's no other way to put it.
[07:04:13.460 --> 07:04:15.022]  Or frontmen for Al-Qaeda.
[07:04:15.780 --> 07:04:22.145]  And this is supposed to create a new puppet Syrian council under the control of the US.
[07:04:22.185 --> 07:04:23.406]  And Hillary Clinton is very clear.
[07:04:23.726 --> 07:04:34.754]  She says, we want to have the fighting men, the people who are on the ground fighting the Syrian army, they have to be more represented in the Syrian puppet council, right?
[07:04:34.774 --> 07:04:36.296]  They'll have a new name for it, I'm sure.
[07:04:36.736 --> 07:04:40.479]  So what she's really saying is, we want the Al-Qaeda people
[07:04:41.232 --> 07:04:51.780]  You know, Al-Qaeda under 99 different disguises will make up the vast majority of this council, which is more or less what happened in Libya, right?
[07:04:51.840 --> 07:04:53.181]  And you see what happens in Libya.
[07:04:55.003 --> 07:05:04.530]  Parenthetically, I'm afraid Ambassador Stevens was there to organize new shipments of Al-Qaeda fighters and perhaps of weapons
[07:05:05.327 --> 07:05:07.708]  To Turkey, and then into Syria, right?
[07:05:07.728 --> 07:05:10.489]  His last conversation was with a Turkish official.
[07:05:10.609 --> 07:05:15.691]  It's tragic that the guy got killed, of course, but we shouldn't have any illusions about what he was doing there.
[07:05:16.111 --> 07:05:21.693]  One of his colleagues, one of the people that Stevens would have worked closely with, is Ambassador Ford.
[07:05:22.253 --> 07:05:24.814]  And Ambassador Ford is the former U.S.
[07:05:24.874 --> 07:05:27.695]  Ambassador to Syria, was kicked out.
[07:05:28.433 --> 07:05:38.054]  He's going to be the dominant person at this meeting in Qatar, and he of course is another, a guy like Stevens, a contact man for these Al-Qaeda people.
[07:05:38.758 --> 07:05:39.998]  Uh, in the death squads, right?
[07:05:40.018 --> 07:05:42.459]  He's, he's worked very, very closely with them.
[07:05:42.779 --> 07:05:46.640]  You remember that Ford is the disciple of Negro Ponte.
[07:05:47.200 --> 07:05:57.062]  And Negro Ponte had, had, uh, become associated with this concept of the death squads in Latin America already in the 80s and Central America, the 80s and 90s.
[07:05:57.402 --> 07:05:59.463]  He then went on to bring this concept to Iraq.
[07:06:00.632 --> 07:06:02.694]  In the past decade.
[07:06:03.214 --> 07:06:06.237]  And his primary disciple is Ford.
[07:06:06.277 --> 07:06:08.759]  So you can see what they're trying to do.
[07:06:10.581 --> 07:06:13.043]  But on the whole, this is a strategy of weakness.
[07:06:13.103 --> 07:06:19.789]  In other words, it's a strategy of military defeat and it's a strategy of political disarray.
[07:06:20.433 --> 07:06:36.896]  The only way that some of the death squads have remained in the field is that the CIA has been telling them, keep fighting because after the US election, we will begin shipping you more weapons and we'll get another wave, another echo.
[07:06:37.216 --> 07:06:40.036]  And by the way, we're going to have to continue after this.
[07:06:40.076 --> 07:06:40.837]  Interrupt for a moment.
[07:06:40.877 --> 07:06:47.658]  The celebrations are reaching rapture point right now with the Obamanoids.
[07:06:47.678 --> 07:06:49.138]  We're going to have four more years.
[07:06:49.138 --> 07:06:49.558]  We're good.
[07:07:09.858 --> 07:07:18.361]  See, Webster, you're presented with two different puppets, and you need to believe within the spectrum that you're somehow engaging, and that one thing is a victory.
[07:07:18.461 --> 07:07:29.284]  I understand that I'm ruining, like, the delicious seventh course French cuisine sherbert that is being brought out to you, but, I mean, this is going to be a nightmare.
[07:07:30.223 --> 07:07:37.665]  And all I can do is gloat on the patheticness of these people in reflected glory, worshipping a New World Order puppet.
[07:07:37.685 --> 07:07:39.426]  I mean, I'm sorry, I just have to do it.
[07:07:39.586 --> 07:07:40.826]  What's the percentage in that?
[07:07:41.767 --> 07:07:46.568]  The point is, these are two unacceptable candidates, to put it mildly.
[07:07:47.008 --> 07:07:48.529]  But there are differences, and
[07:07:49.474 --> 07:07:57.879]  Just this idea, again, a Wall Street hedge fund hyena, in this day and age, right after that crash, that would have been so degrading.
[07:07:57.959 --> 07:07:59.400]  I think you can see this.
[07:07:59.420 --> 07:07:59.900]  No, I agree.
[07:07:59.960 --> 07:08:04.042]  It's better to have Obama run by the exact same people, just as a lawyer on the front line.
[07:08:04.062 --> 07:08:05.743]  Remember, Obama is a candidate.
[07:08:05.803 --> 07:08:08.125]  He has outlived his usefulness in many ways.
[07:08:08.485 --> 07:08:10.486]  He is a spent force in many ways.
[07:08:10.966 --> 07:08:15.269]  And remember, the goal in these elections is not the candidates.
[07:08:15.349 --> 07:08:17.090]  You want to fight the ruling class.
[07:08:17.130 --> 07:08:17.830]  No, I got it.
[07:08:18.090 --> 07:08:19.735]  Okay, well why the ruling class?
[07:08:19.895 --> 07:08:20.757]  You disagree.
[07:08:21.258 --> 07:08:23.243]  You think the ruling class was for Romney.
[07:08:23.925 --> 07:08:24.406]  Yes, I do.
[07:08:25.882 --> 07:08:31.584]  I think the basic thing was Romney says I'll give you a 30% cut in the standard of living.
[07:08:32.064 --> 07:08:35.665]  Obama says I'll give you a 15% cut in the standard of living.
[07:08:36.125 --> 07:08:40.826]  But then the difference is with Romney, you immediately have a big blowback, right?
[07:08:40.846 --> 07:08:43.987]  A lot of strikes, a lot of ferment, big opposition.
[07:08:44.547 --> 07:08:50.109]  I was in many ways tempted by that perspective because that would be a chance to organize, right?
[07:08:50.169 --> 07:08:51.449]  And we're not getting any younger.
[07:08:51.469 --> 07:08:54.530]  And the other thing with Obama, it's a more subtle
[07:08:55.410 --> 07:09:06.617]  Process of betrayal and the knife goes in, not so obviously, but the big thing that Obama offers is that there won't be that much opposition.
[07:09:06.677 --> 07:09:07.558]  That's what he's hoping.
[07:09:07.678 --> 07:09:08.279]  Exactly.
[07:09:08.339 --> 07:09:10.820]  More fast and furious, going after my guns.
[07:09:10.840 --> 07:09:11.841]  I like that.
[07:09:11.921 --> 07:09:12.501]  I like that.
[07:09:13.202 --> 07:09:14.863]  There will be such an opposition.
[07:09:15.993 --> 07:09:22.498]  I'm going to try to do what I can to create a class-based opposition against austerity and against Obama.
[07:09:22.538 --> 07:09:25.441]  It'll be against austerity and therefore against Obama.
[07:09:25.681 --> 07:09:33.908]  And I would urge you to look back at that whole Ron Paul experience and search your conscience and look at what Ron Paul actually represented.
[07:09:34.428 --> 07:09:37.551]  The fact is, austerity is genocide.
[07:09:38.197 --> 07:09:39.779]  We can't have any more austerity.
[07:09:40.279 --> 07:09:41.921]  And that's what the ruling class wants.
[07:09:42.001 --> 07:09:43.482]  Hold on, let's fade this up, though.
[07:09:43.622 --> 07:09:45.805]  Hold on, we're hearing a celebration right now.
[07:09:45.865 --> 07:09:46.826]  Fade it up for a moment.
[07:09:49.308 --> 07:09:50.750]  What do we care about these people?
[07:09:50.850 --> 07:09:52.531]  Oh, this is an incredible celebration.
[07:09:52.551 --> 07:09:55.254]  Don't cut it on this moment of democracy, Webster.
[07:09:56.315 --> 07:09:57.877]  This is a moment of savor.
[07:09:59.438 --> 07:10:00.880]  You can't savor this with me?
[07:10:01.678 --> 07:10:03.219]  Alex, you're too fixated on this stuff.
[07:10:03.239 --> 07:10:04.679]  You gotta get a perspective, right?
[07:10:04.699 --> 07:10:07.280]  A mass struggle perspective and a programmatic perspective.
[07:10:07.300 --> 07:10:10.802]  You know, it's not my fault if I love Obama, Webster, and I wish you wouldn't dash my dreams.
[07:10:10.822 --> 07:10:12.022]  Look at Syriza, right, in Greece.
[07:10:12.062 --> 07:10:12.383]  Come on.
[07:10:12.603 --> 07:10:13.303]  Be serious.
[07:10:13.683 --> 07:10:14.864]  Look at Syriza in Greece.
[07:10:14.904 --> 07:10:18.085]  That gets you... Well together, different groups for a serious opposition.
[07:10:18.485 --> 07:10:18.945]  That's right.
[07:10:19.325 --> 07:10:20.246]  That's what you need to do.
[07:10:21.186 --> 07:10:22.767]  But in terms of the war stuff,
[07:10:23.785 --> 07:10:25.527]  It's going to be interesting to see now.
[07:10:25.547 --> 07:10:27.328]  Oh my God, look at that guy with the American flag.
[07:10:27.368 --> 07:10:29.330]  I mean, that is archival.
[07:10:29.350 --> 07:10:34.374]  Alex, if you're going to be interested in them, we're going to have to say goodnight, okay?
[07:10:34.934 --> 07:10:37.356]  If I'm not interested in Syriza?
[07:10:37.596 --> 07:10:40.198]  I can't compete with the big demonstration.
[07:10:41.259 --> 07:10:41.939]  I understand.
[07:10:41.959 --> 07:10:43.300]  I understand you can't, Webster.
[07:10:43.321 --> 07:10:47.384]  We'll just close in comment then, Webster, and we'll let you savor your victory.
[07:10:50.149 --> 07:10:57.639]  Alex, you gotta basically pull yourself off that limb where the leprechaun has left many.
[07:10:58.300 --> 07:11:00.743]  I would say right now, people should be...
[07:11:02.176 --> 07:11:07.118]  You know, not full of fear, but confident now.
[07:11:07.178 --> 07:11:07.999]  We know what it is.
[07:11:08.679 --> 07:11:12.281]  Obama's going to come with killer austerity, and we're going to fight back.
[07:11:12.521 --> 07:11:16.523]  And if you want to be part of humanity, you've got to fight back against killer austerity.
[07:11:16.543 --> 07:11:22.086]  And you'll be linking up with the European labor movement, people in Greece and Spain and elsewhere.
[07:11:22.106 --> 07:11:24.487]  That's what real populism is, right?
[07:11:24.667 --> 07:11:27.548]  Populism is not to strip people of their economic rights.
[07:11:27.968 --> 07:11:29.649]  Union busting is not populism.
[07:11:29.929 --> 07:11:31.230]  This whole libertarian
[07:11:32.571 --> 07:11:46.521]  Well, the Tea Party was taken over by the neocons, but let's just stop right there.
[07:11:46.901 --> 07:11:58.389]  Webster, I know you're a smart guy, but you like Aspartame, I've seen you, you like McDonald's, and you think it's like a proletariat thing that you're with the people taking the flu shot.
[07:12:00.416 --> 07:12:01.017]  What are we?
[07:12:01.237 --> 07:12:07.403]  Do we want to be mass leaders or do we want to be lifestyle freaks and petty bourgeois food faddists?
[07:12:07.844 --> 07:12:11.888]  It's like a macho thing that you can take the flu shot every year and still walk.
[07:12:12.549 --> 07:12:13.109]  My God.
[07:12:13.129 --> 07:12:16.092]  Why are we so obsessed with trivia?
[07:12:17.313 --> 07:12:18.675]  Too obsessed with trivia.
[07:12:18.695 --> 07:12:21.978]  You think GMO and vaccines is trivia?
[07:12:22.038 --> 07:12:23.340]  That's where they're getting us, Webster.
[07:12:24.614 --> 07:12:33.356]  I'm looking at the issues where it's possible to organize a mass-based... Oh no, Webster, the real revolution is against the injections the eugenicists are hitting us with.
[07:12:33.696 --> 07:12:35.236]  How many flu shots have you had, Webster?
[07:12:36.096 --> 07:12:39.737]  Alex, get serious or I gotta go... I know you gotta go.
[07:12:39.757 --> 07:12:42.538]  No, you've told me I should get my flu shot in the car.
[07:12:42.878 --> 07:12:44.358]  You've proselytized me.
[07:12:45.138 --> 07:12:45.618]  So what?
[07:12:46.778 --> 07:12:47.519]  Is that heresy?
[07:12:48.039 --> 07:12:54.080]  I mean, maybe you're a damn Martian and there's like Martian viruses in there and you want me to join your space cult.
[07:12:55.046 --> 07:12:56.907]  All of those things are calculations, right?
[07:12:57.027 --> 07:12:58.589]  Everything has a plus and a minus.
[07:12:58.909 --> 07:13:00.890]  You know how many people die of the flu each year?
[07:13:00.910 --> 07:13:02.151]  It's more like 2,000.
[07:13:02.211 --> 07:13:03.852]  They claim it's 35,000.
[07:13:03.912 --> 07:13:04.773]  It's a fraudulent number.
[07:13:05.325 --> 07:13:05.565]  Is it?
[07:13:05.945 --> 07:13:06.685]  Well, I don't know.
[07:13:07.266 --> 07:13:15.108]  But I don't believe the world is ending next week, and I don't live in fear, and I don't take counsel of my fears, and I think it's a pretty clear perspective.
[07:13:15.128 --> 07:13:16.388]  Well, then why not drink cyanide?
[07:13:16.408 --> 07:13:20.549]  Go, I'm not fearing, and just like, you know, how about jump off a thousand foot bridge and say, I don't fear.
[07:13:20.929 --> 07:13:30.972]  To imply that we know GMO is bad, we know vaccines are bad, we know the New World Order, and I have the White House Science Czar's own book that you did a review of, where he says they're going to jack the water supply.
[07:13:31.172 --> 07:13:32.292]  That's right.
[07:13:32.372 --> 07:13:33.593]  You better be ready to fight him.
[07:13:33.813 --> 07:13:35.833]  But you never saw who Romney had, right?
[07:13:35.914 --> 07:13:42.095]  Romney probably had some concentration camp commandant left over from the last days of the war.
[07:13:42.195 --> 07:13:44.576]  I mean, my God, Ben, your king has won.
[07:13:44.636 --> 07:13:45.937]  Obama is now in.
[07:13:45.957 --> 07:13:47.317]  We're not talking about Romney.
[07:13:47.397 --> 07:13:53.199]  Alex, nobody, nobody, nobody in the world has done more than me to expose Obama.
[07:13:54.170 --> 07:13:56.372]  I exposed Obama, I exposed Romney.
[07:13:56.713 --> 07:13:59.155]  The one enemy of this ruling class is me.
[07:13:59.395 --> 07:14:00.316]  That's my record.
[07:14:00.597 --> 07:14:07.604]  And I didn't support any damn Republican all the way through this cycle who was proposing genocide against the American people.
[07:14:07.624 --> 07:14:09.206]  Because that's where I drew the line.
[07:14:09.766 --> 07:14:10.407]  So there it is.
[07:14:11.608 --> 07:14:13.310]  My record, I stand on my record.
[07:14:13.370 --> 07:14:14.291]  I'm proud of my record.
[07:14:15.566 --> 07:14:17.187]  Did you take your flu shot this year?
[07:14:17.828 --> 07:14:18.428]  Come on, Alex.
[07:14:18.488 --> 07:14:19.188]  Get serious.
[07:14:19.609 --> 07:14:20.209]  Get serious.
[07:14:20.469 --> 07:14:21.730]  Have you stopped beating your wife?
[07:14:22.010 --> 07:14:26.873]  These are questions that people... I didn't say in a car with you, you better beat your wife, Tarpley.
[07:14:26.893 --> 07:14:27.974]  What are you talking about?
[07:14:28.014 --> 07:14:33.378]  You've lectured me that I need to take my government injections because it's proof that I'm part of the... You are obsessed with trivia.
[07:14:33.458 --> 07:14:35.119]  Get the big picture.
[07:14:35.159 --> 07:14:39.702]  You have literally told me I should drink Diet Coke and I should inject
[07:14:40.581 --> 07:14:41.781]  Merck Pharmaceuticals.
[07:14:41.801 --> 07:14:44.242]  If you are on the road, you do what you have to do.
[07:14:44.602 --> 07:14:47.883]  Alex, are you... Let me say goodnight to you, Alex.
[07:14:48.263 --> 07:14:49.464]  Alright, Webster, have a good evening.
[07:14:49.924 --> 07:14:51.584]  There he goes, lapping the hood up to no good.
[07:14:52.445 --> 07:14:53.825]  So there goes Webster.
[07:14:53.925 --> 07:14:57.606]  I mean, look, I like Webster, but he's gotten more wild over the years.
[07:14:58.287 --> 07:15:00.427]  I mean, this constant thing about, where did you get that?
[07:15:00.467 --> 07:15:02.628]  Did you get that from the Koch brothers?
[07:15:03.228 --> 07:15:05.829]  So I'm just, you know, I mean, I like Webster, but man...
[07:15:08.166 --> 07:15:11.950]  I mean, we're talking about totally, he's a good guy.
[07:15:13.191 --> 07:15:17.495]  But, you know, it's just like any points, it's just endless condescension.
[07:15:18.196 --> 07:15:23.941]  Let's talk to Lester in Arkansas, then Lewis, Nick, and Noel, and that's it for the special transmission tonight.
[07:15:25.360 --> 07:15:27.721]  And you just heard Tarpley.
[07:15:27.761 --> 07:15:30.062]  We're pretty darn evil folks.
[07:15:30.122 --> 07:15:34.283]  I mean, actually, I like Tarpley, but I do want to get him on sometime and like have this debate about vaccines.
[07:15:34.623 --> 07:15:37.504]  Because he was like telling me, you should get your flu shot and it's very good for you.
[07:15:37.904 --> 07:15:38.965]  I was like, well, let me show you some studies.
[07:15:39.065 --> 07:15:39.765]  Oh, I don't want to hear that.
[07:15:39.845 --> 07:15:40.845]  Robinson Crusoe.
[07:15:40.885 --> 07:15:41.385]  That's a quote.
[07:15:41.685 --> 07:15:42.626]  You need to get your shot.
[07:15:42.686 --> 07:15:46.727]  So, you know, I have never called him on that, but he like knows about eugenics and all these things.
[07:15:47.087 --> 07:15:47.868]  I'm with the people.
[07:15:47.948 --> 07:15:48.508]  It's tough.
[07:15:48.548 --> 07:15:49.088]  They're getting it.
[07:15:49.388 --> 07:15:49.968]  I'm getting it.
[07:15:49.988 --> 07:15:51.229]  And I'm like, well, you know what?
[07:15:51.349 --> 07:15:52.029]  I ain't getting it.
[07:15:53.510 --> 07:15:54.570]  I can read the insert on.
[07:15:55.071 --> 07:15:56.832]  Oh, these are just small pleasantries.
[07:15:56.852 --> 07:15:59.474]  I'm not fighting with Tarpley.
[07:16:00.814 --> 07:16:01.395]  I mean, I'm not.
[07:16:01.415 --> 07:16:12.722]  It's just that, you know what, I'm not going to eat GMO and I'm not going, I mean, he thinks marijuana is a narcotic and I don't even smoke marijuana, but I mean, you know, I'm not, he's for drug laws, folks.
[07:16:13.422 --> 07:16:21.267]  And I mean, there's just some things with Tarpley that are just kind of, kind of, kind of, and I tried to debate him, you know, I'm not here getting him off the air and then talking about him.
[07:16:21.287 --> 07:16:21.748]  He hung up.
[07:16:22.779 --> 07:16:23.560]  He's like, good evening!
[07:16:23.580 --> 07:16:26.263]  Because he wants to go watch television and savor this.
[07:16:26.283 --> 07:16:28.966]  Let me tell you what Tarpley's doing right now in Maryland in his townhouse.
[07:16:29.427 --> 07:16:30.868]  He's got that television on.
[07:16:31.950 --> 07:16:33.932]  Sitting back, getting into the trance state.
[07:16:34.733 --> 07:16:37.075]  The cerebral disconnect.
[07:16:37.696 --> 07:16:39.839]  And he is savoring this victory.
[07:16:40.259 --> 07:16:43.381]  You see, I wouldn't be savoring... Oh, turn him up, please.
[07:16:43.601 --> 07:16:45.022]  Can we please hear the Supreme Leader?
[07:16:46.183 --> 07:16:48.384]  Ladies and gentlemen, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il III.
[07:16:48.424 --> 07:16:50.245]  This is a great victory.
[07:16:50.265 --> 07:16:50.665]  Turn it up.
[07:16:51.226 --> 07:16:55.308]  He's going to talk about unifying America now, and this is for all Americans, this victory.
[07:16:56.709 --> 07:17:01.071]  And this is a great day, and you're all going to get Obama phones and cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[07:17:01.091 --> 07:17:03.473]  The government's going to run your healthcare, written by big insurance companies.
[07:17:04.042 --> 07:17:09.047]  That's okay, because the unions are making sure your jobs go to China and the bailout went to China.
[07:17:09.848 --> 07:17:12.051]  Well, he's going to torture you and secretly arrest you in the TSA.
[07:17:12.071 --> 07:17:13.392]  He's going to play ping pong in your pants.
[07:17:13.773 --> 07:17:16.696]  Don't worry, you can ride the train where they won't grub you, but they actually will be grubbing you.
[07:17:16.796 --> 07:17:19.118]  Again, I'm not supposed to celebrate this.
[07:17:19.138 --> 07:17:21.200]  I'm supposed to just absolutely love this right now.
[07:17:22.366 --> 07:17:22.746]  Here we go.
[07:17:22.786 --> 07:17:23.266]  Oh my gosh.
[07:17:23.506 --> 07:17:24.406]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's live.
[07:17:24.446 --> 07:17:24.886]  He's live.
[07:17:25.207 --> 07:17:25.567]  Get ready.
[07:17:25.787 --> 07:17:26.167]  Get ready.
[07:17:26.587 --> 07:17:26.707]  Oh.
[07:17:27.167 --> 07:17:27.287]  Oh.
[07:17:27.767 --> 07:17:27.867]  Oh.
[07:17:28.347 --> 07:17:28.447]  Oh.
[07:17:29.027 --> 07:17:29.147]  Oh.
[07:17:29.567 --> 07:17:29.667]  Oh.
[07:17:30.007 --> 07:17:30.107]  Oh.
[07:17:30.388 --> 07:17:31.728]  My personal power is increasing.
[07:17:32.108 --> 07:17:33.268]  I invested in Obama.
[07:17:33.548 --> 07:17:34.028]  I'm winning.
[07:17:34.048 --> 07:17:34.908]  I'm winning.
[07:17:35.388 --> 07:17:35.889]  I'm winning.
[07:17:35.909 --> 07:17:37.029]  Oh my gosh.
[07:17:37.509 --> 07:17:37.669]  Oh.
[07:17:38.189 --> 07:17:38.509]  Oh.
[07:17:38.829 --> 07:17:39.729]  I'm powerful now.
[07:17:40.089 --> 07:17:40.469]  Woo.
[07:17:40.689 --> 07:17:41.110]  Woo.
[07:17:41.350 --> 07:17:41.770]  Woo.
[07:17:41.990 --> 07:17:42.390]  Woo.
[07:17:42.650 --> 07:17:42.890]  Woo.
[07:17:43.290 --> 07:17:44.150]  Obama phone.
[07:17:44.470 --> 07:17:45.310]  Obama phone.
[07:17:45.630 --> 07:17:46.431]  Obama phone.
[07:17:46.451 --> 07:17:47.711]  Sorry, Lester Lewis.
[07:17:47.951 --> 07:17:48.591]  Go back to it.
[07:17:50.697 --> 07:17:54.559]  The feed cut out right there at the moment of absolute rapture?
[07:17:54.579 --> 07:17:58.300]  At the moment of absolute rapture?
[07:17:58.320 --> 07:18:02.922]  You deny me Valhalla reverence to my leader?
[07:18:04.023 --> 07:18:06.464]  Get Obama back on now!
[07:18:06.484 --> 07:18:10.005]  The company won the right to determine its own destiny.
[07:18:10.606 --> 07:18:10.766]  Oh yeah.
[07:18:10.786 --> 07:18:12.046]  Get your guns.
[07:18:12.066 --> 07:18:15.908]  The task of perfecting our union moves forward.
[07:18:16.855 --> 07:18:21.917]  Moves forward, he's gonna tell your kids what to eat, he's gonna get your guns, he's gonna inject you.
[07:18:22.437 --> 07:18:23.277]  And abortions too.
[07:18:23.297 --> 07:18:24.737]  It moves forward because of you.
[07:18:25.077 --> 07:18:27.258]  Move it forward Catholics, you're gonna pay for abortions.
[07:18:27.698 --> 07:18:34.500]  It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression.
[07:18:34.520 --> 07:18:36.701]  And we're gonna shut down a thousand coal power plants.
[07:18:36.721 --> 07:18:39.282]  And Romney would've done the same.
[07:18:43.211 --> 07:18:53.539]  The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation.
[07:18:53.599 --> 07:18:55.380]  In other words, you didn't build that.
[07:18:58.943 --> 07:19:08.590]  Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard,
[07:19:09.793 --> 07:19:12.395]  We're going to get the guns from these damn redneck racists.
[07:19:12.415 --> 07:19:13.175]  You heard it earlier.
[07:19:13.456 --> 07:19:16.438]  If you want guns, you're white scum and we're going to get you.
[07:19:16.658 --> 07:19:19.420]  I'm sorry, I'm going to tell them that Obama was an earlier guest.
[07:19:20.601 --> 07:19:23.543]  We don't like government health care, you're scum too.
[07:19:27.926 --> 07:19:29.687]  Yay, we're domesticated!
[07:19:29.787 --> 07:19:31.328]  Yay!
[07:19:31.368 --> 07:19:32.589]  That's what Trump wanted to get off.
[07:19:32.609 --> 07:19:35.331]  He wanted to savor, savor the little speech.
[07:19:43.706 --> 07:19:52.092]  Whether you voted for the very first time, or waited in line for a very long time,
[07:19:53.991 --> 07:19:57.734]  We're going to get the American people's guns and take their property and put them in re-education camps.
[07:19:58.134 --> 07:20:00.335]  You will stomp the brains out of the American people.
[07:20:00.656 --> 07:20:03.377]  You will have the power you never had working hard at a real job.
[07:20:03.658 --> 07:20:04.939]  You will wear black uniforms.
[07:20:04.959 --> 07:20:06.119]  You will grab their genitals.
[07:20:06.440 --> 07:20:08.161]  You will proctology exam them.
[07:20:08.181 --> 07:20:09.802]  You will slam their heads into walls.
[07:20:10.122 --> 07:20:12.684]  I will have predator drones murder people on seven continents.
[07:20:12.924 --> 07:20:18.988]  We will invade everywhere and have forced abortions in Africa, murdering as many blacks as we can, because I'm black and it's okay.
[07:20:20.289 --> 07:20:21.090]  And you made a difference.
[07:20:22.816 --> 07:20:23.337]  Made a difference.
[07:20:23.357 --> 07:20:24.378]  We're gonna murder all of you.
[07:20:25.238 --> 07:20:30.844]  I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard-fought campaign.
[07:20:30.944 --> 07:20:32.806]  I'm working with the same globalist scum that I did.
[07:20:38.592 --> 07:20:42.896]  We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply.
[07:20:42.956 --> 07:20:44.478]  And we're fighting over destroying America.
[07:20:44.498 --> 07:20:45.519]  Alright, that's enough.
[07:20:45.599 --> 07:20:46.540]  I can't hear any more of this.
[07:20:49.838 --> 07:20:51.119]  I would have been unhappy either way.
[07:20:51.139 --> 07:20:53.080]  It's just a total spectacle of filth.
[07:20:53.900 --> 07:20:55.361]  Let's take a few final calls here.
[07:20:55.821 --> 07:20:57.623]  No more of this victory lap.
[07:20:57.663 --> 07:20:58.563]  They're coming after our guns.
[07:20:58.583 --> 07:20:58.923]  Get ready.
[07:20:59.744 --> 07:21:04.307]  And I'm supposed to just turn them in, because if you don't, you've heard, it's racist.
[07:21:05.227 --> 07:21:06.188]  They don't want to have your guns.
[07:21:06.708 --> 07:21:09.470]  Lester in Arkansas, you're on the air, sir.
[07:21:09.530 --> 07:21:09.870]  Welcome.
[07:21:10.050 --> 07:21:15.034]  I'm sorry to put you on hold during our dear leader, our dear Fuhrer speaking.
[07:21:15.074 --> 07:21:15.394]  Go ahead.
[07:21:20.063 --> 07:21:22.125]  Sounds like you're listening to the same thing I was.
[07:21:24.807 --> 07:21:25.467]  Thank you, Lester.
[07:21:25.527 --> 07:21:26.088]  Have a good day.
[07:21:26.688 --> 07:21:28.410]  Lewis in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[07:21:28.430 --> 07:21:30.371]  Hey, Alex.
[07:21:30.451 --> 07:21:31.312]  Great show, man.
[07:21:31.332 --> 07:21:33.133]  I'm glad you're covering the election.
[07:21:33.594 --> 07:21:35.455]  Well, I'm kind of being lazy about it, though.
[07:21:35.475 --> 07:21:37.597]  We're only into 11, 12 hours.
[07:21:38.638 --> 07:21:39.178]  Yeah, I know.
[07:21:39.218 --> 07:21:40.739]  You're tired and everything.
[07:21:40.759 --> 07:21:43.141]  Hey, I got a couple points I want to make.
[07:21:44.642 --> 07:21:50.044]  You know, I've been involved here in the politics in Oklahoma and there's been a lot of people waking up.
[07:21:50.124 --> 07:21:53.466]  I mean, like, at the state convention, about half of them was Ron Paul folks.
[07:21:54.746 --> 07:21:57.547]  And I got a little strategy here on a local level.
[07:21:57.608 --> 07:22:05.571]  Now, some of you patriots out there, you know, if you're in an abominoid state, you might want to move to a romanoid state because
[07:22:06.624 --> 07:22:27.123]  You know, this is, I mean, this could be one of the, uh, I think they actually made a mistake in stalling Obama again, because, uh, you know, now you have the Romneyoids conjoined with the Liberty people that are really awake, and when the federal government totally overplays its hand
[07:22:28.160 --> 07:22:55.113]  to where these legislators in uh... your state government you know the ones that are being paid off by like the chamber of commerce and you know a couple global bankers you might have hanging around your state when they realize that their their way of life is being threatened all of a sudden what's going to happen is going to be a big mass flop over to the uh... liberty side and you know these guys have been dishonest and you know they get these uh...
[07:22:56.109 --> 07:23:05.033]  You know, like these, uh, you know, three-figure jobs, you know, from the Chamber and, uh, different banks and, you know, revolving door type stuff we have here locally.
[07:23:05.533 --> 07:23:11.096]  They're gonna realize it doesn't matter how much money they have or what they're doing, that their whole doggone country is getting sucked down the tubes.
[07:23:11.636 --> 07:23:12.296]  Oh, that's right.
[07:23:12.316 --> 07:23:13.677]  You know, that's right.
[07:23:13.917 --> 07:23:16.219]  And, um, collectivism doesn't work.
[07:23:16.279 --> 07:23:21.001]  I don't care what stuff we hear of people that want to manage things and claim they can make everything better that way.
[07:23:21.502 --> 07:23:29.006]  But we don't even have a government at this point to protect us from the ravaging activities of the foreign pirates as well, so we're just in a lot of trouble.
[07:23:29.046 --> 07:23:29.766]  But great points.
[07:23:29.806 --> 07:23:31.728]  Good to hear from you, Lewis in Oklahoma.
[07:23:31.808 --> 07:23:33.829]  Nick in California in the know-well, and I'm out of here.
[07:23:34.649 --> 07:23:36.930]  Go ahead, we've got a roundtable coming up though.
[07:23:37.070 --> 07:23:39.550]  Go ahead, I'm going to get five greedy hours of sleep.
[07:23:40.370 --> 07:23:41.630]  Nick in California, go ahead.
[07:23:41.650 --> 07:23:43.631]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[07:23:43.691 --> 07:23:45.191]  I've got a comment and then a question.
[07:23:45.211 --> 07:23:53.053]  It looks over now, but I wanted to respond to your question you asked a caller earlier about, you know, in your gut, who do you think is more dangerous?
[07:23:54.253 --> 07:23:55.093]  Obama or Romney?
[07:23:55.253 --> 07:23:59.234]  In my gut I kind of felt like Romney would be worse, but in my mind I think, you know,
[07:24:00.169 --> 07:24:03.692]  The establishment's choice was Obama, which means he's gotta be the worst one.
[07:24:30.213 --> 07:24:45.656]  But I wanted to bring up something I called in about before, and that's about organized stalking, gang stalking, because I talked with other targeted individuals and we were all universally sort of disappointed in your response, you know, basically saying that it's mostly schizophrenia.
[07:24:46.177 --> 07:24:52.578]  But I've never heard it mentioned on your show before, and then a month later or so you mentioned it, gang stalking, in your Sean Stone interview.
[07:24:53.410 --> 07:24:56.192]  And we just wish you would give it some coverage because it is real.
[07:24:56.232 --> 07:24:57.973]  It is going on all over the world.
[07:24:58.113 --> 07:25:02.896]  I know there's all sorts of government and other corporate manipulations and gang type stuff.
[07:25:03.317 --> 07:25:06.759]  I'm just saying some of it is like crazy people because I've seen it on YouTube.
[07:25:07.319 --> 07:25:08.480]  It's sadly entertaining.
[07:25:10.121 --> 07:25:13.143]  You know, people think I'm a cable repairman outside that's coming to get them.
[07:25:13.223 --> 07:25:16.906]  I mean, you know, but in this crazy world, who knows what's true.
[07:25:17.306 --> 07:25:17.786]  But I hear you.
[07:25:17.806 --> 07:25:18.707]  I appreciate your call.
[07:25:19.147 --> 07:25:20.988]  Noel in Virginia, you're on the air.
[07:25:21.048 --> 07:25:21.409]  Go ahead.
[07:25:22.185 --> 07:25:24.626]  I'm laughing because you got me on stitches.
[07:25:25.146 --> 07:25:29.027]  First of all, I want to tell you, for you and your staff, you did an excellent job.
[07:25:29.147 --> 07:25:30.727]  I really enjoyed this election.
[07:25:31.408 --> 07:25:31.748]  Okay?
[07:25:32.768 --> 07:25:41.130]  I enjoyed it because there was so much information you were giving me while CNN, you know, I had it on mute, was just the same old thing.
[07:25:41.470 --> 07:25:50.653]  You know, it's sad tonight for the American people, because I saw the interviews, American people don't even know what's going on in this world, with their own country.
[07:25:51.531 --> 07:25:54.554]  It's a shame that we've been so blind to the truth.
[07:25:54.614 --> 07:26:04.864]  You know, I've been studying a little law like UCC 1308 and the Black Law Book and the Barron Banking.
[07:26:05.024 --> 07:26:09.609]  I'm starting to get to know that I have rights and I have to exercise it.
[07:26:09.709 --> 07:26:10.830]  Nobody else is going to do it.
[07:26:10.970 --> 07:26:12.552]  I have to stand up for what I believe.
[07:26:13.211 --> 07:26:14.812]  You know what I mean, Alex?
[07:26:15.112 --> 07:26:15.613]  Yes, sir.
[07:26:15.833 --> 07:26:16.293]  Exactly.
[07:26:16.313 --> 07:26:19.175]  There's these multinationals who know what's going on.
[07:26:19.215 --> 07:26:20.156]  They're robbing us.
[07:26:20.516 --> 07:26:23.638]  And we're individuals that have to stand up and exercise.
[07:26:23.698 --> 07:26:25.139]  It doesn't mean we can't band together.
[07:26:25.620 --> 07:26:26.280]  But you're absolutely right.
[07:26:26.300 --> 07:26:27.841]  There's a whole world out there.
[07:26:28.402 --> 07:26:32.384]  And trying to work within this corrupt system, that's one thing we can do.
[07:26:32.404 --> 07:26:34.045]  But we've got to work also without it.
[07:26:34.346 --> 07:26:37.288]  Because it's like I work in the Matrix, but I'm without it.
[07:26:37.788 --> 07:26:39.829]  Yeah, I'm in it, but I'm also outside of it.
[07:26:40.349 --> 07:26:51.214]  And that's what's so sad, because no matter... Sure, you could have some system that tried to help people, but when the system is eugenics-based... You know, like when I said to Tarpley, I said, well, this is eugenics-based.
[07:26:51.254 --> 07:26:54.396]  We can't trust government healthcare when it's run by a bunch of...
[07:26:55.396 --> 07:26:57.198]  You know, people that created the Nazis.
[07:26:57.278 --> 07:26:58.880]  And he's like, well, but what about Romney?
[07:26:58.920 --> 07:27:00.542]  I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?
[07:27:00.822 --> 07:27:02.604]  I'm not talking about Obama or Romney.
[07:27:02.624 --> 07:27:03.625]  They're just front men.
[07:27:04.086 --> 07:27:08.291]  We've got to talk about the larger system of who controls this.
[07:27:08.331 --> 07:27:10.133]  And I'm not trying to bash Tarpley.
[07:27:10.173 --> 07:27:10.633]  It's just that
[07:27:11.374 --> 07:27:11.795]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:27:11.835 --> 07:27:12.756]  Listen, the only way I feel
[07:27:29.753 --> 07:27:31.595]  And I think this is how you feel?
[07:27:31.996 --> 07:27:35.220]  I think we have to go back to the forefathers in 1776.
[07:27:36.141 --> 07:27:39.385]  I think the American people should wake up and take back our sovereignty.
[07:27:39.765 --> 07:27:41.868]  I mean, people don't know the history of this country.
[07:27:41.888 --> 07:27:44.070]  It just took time to research.
[07:27:44.231 --> 07:27:47.595]  If you see 1860, it was a bunch of men that made this.
[07:27:48.415 --> 07:27:49.135]  That's right.
[07:27:49.155 --> 07:27:49.936]  No, you're exactly right.
[07:28:16.573 --> 07:28:17.653]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[07:28:18.054 --> 07:28:27.777]  I mean, look at these people waving the flags and all this, and don't even know that that's a CEO guy that you just voted in to continue the program!
[07:28:28.177 --> 07:28:33.359]  Exactly, and I mean, both guys are bad, and then it's like, well, you've got to choose a side or you're bad.
[07:28:33.399 --> 07:28:33.679]  No.
[07:28:34.099 --> 07:28:36.820]  I mean, if they're both controlled, then it's all bad.
[07:28:37.020 --> 07:28:40.261]  Listen, great point, great way to end my part of the transmission.
[07:28:40.281 --> 07:28:41.882]  I'm going to hand it over to Sha'Carri Jackson.
[07:28:42.762 --> 07:28:44.784]  Melissa Melton and the rest of the crew that's in there.
[07:28:45.644 --> 07:28:48.046]  Just a great job to the entire crew here tonight with the coverage.
[07:28:48.066 --> 07:28:54.171]  I'm going to go home and get a few hours sleep so I can come back tomorrow on the big radio show, 12 noon to 3 pm Eastern.
[07:28:54.211 --> 07:29:02.698]  But, you know, we know where all this is leading, and it's not leading to a nice place.
[07:29:02.918 --> 07:29:08.182]  And, you know, people are, I see them on the Twitters and the Facebook, ah, you lost, Alex.
[07:29:08.482 --> 07:29:09.023]  No, I didn't.
[07:29:10.183 --> 07:29:11.645]  I was not supporting Romney.
[07:29:14.565 --> 07:29:21.150]  I just hope that as dumb as the public is, they would vote in somebody else as some desperate reset button.
[07:29:21.991 --> 07:29:24.373]  You know when your computer won't work and you're just banging it.
[07:29:24.433 --> 07:29:29.438]  But I mean the fact that they're endorsing what they know Obama is the front man for.
[07:29:29.858 --> 07:29:32.440]  I was going to go after Romney day one when he got elected.
[07:29:32.480 --> 07:29:33.481]  Now I've been going after him.
[07:29:35.891 --> 07:29:37.432]  Now Obama doesn't face re-election.
[07:29:38.212 --> 07:29:43.436]  I was already planning four years to go after Romney so he wouldn't get re-elected, because I knew what he was going to do.
[07:29:43.456 --> 07:29:52.541]  I see all these people associating their personal power with the New World Order, and it's hollow, it's empty.
[07:29:52.862 --> 07:29:59.125]  Aaron Dykes, before we go to Jakari Jackson and a crew in a roundtable discussion for 30 minutes, any other points?
[07:29:59.205 --> 07:30:01.047]  I know you're out there with a large stack of stuff.
[07:30:01.767 --> 07:30:03.688]  I mean, uh, you heard the Tarpley interview.
[07:30:03.808 --> 07:30:04.468]  God bless him.
[07:30:04.488 --> 07:30:08.490]  Uh, left in the hood up to no good, but... Is this just me?
[07:30:09.150 --> 07:30:12.772]  Or is... I mean, I guess Tarpley's just desperate because he thinks things are shutting down.
[07:30:13.212 --> 07:30:19.995]  And he thinks we can, like, fix things for the government, but... The continued attacks on...
[07:30:21.733 --> 07:30:27.275]  Ron Paul, because Ron Paul legitimately thinks government's not the answer.
[07:30:27.615 --> 07:30:28.976]  Let people keep their own money.
[07:30:29.056 --> 07:30:32.237]  It's not starve everybody, let the states take care of people.
[07:30:32.517 --> 07:30:35.379]  I mean, look at the federal government in Katrina and New York and New Jersey.
[07:30:35.759 --> 07:30:36.959]  They can't take care of people.
[07:30:37.519 --> 07:30:38.880]  I mean, this is an evil government.
[07:30:39.040 --> 07:30:46.543]  I mean, sure, some people have been de-industrialized, shut down by the globalists, so they need food stamps, they need welfare.
[07:30:46.563 --> 07:30:47.684]  We're not even talking about that.
[07:30:48.104 --> 07:30:50.985]  But if we can't ever get rid of the globalists, how do we restore anything?
[07:30:51.764 --> 07:30:54.246]  Well, I think Tarpley's focusing on the economy.
[07:30:54.286 --> 07:30:55.567]  He thinks that's the Big Apple.
[07:30:55.607 --> 07:30:58.409]  He sees centralization as a foregone conclusion.
[07:30:58.829 --> 07:31:10.758]  Personally, I'm looking towards anything that can decentralize a little bit, a lot, anything, towards the states, individuals, and that's something I want to bring up in the roundtable or whatever it is we're calling this next segment.
[07:31:11.379 --> 07:31:16.783]  You know, Michael Bolden at the Tenth Amendment Center, they published ten big votes on nullification this week.
[07:31:16.843 --> 07:31:18.024]  Six out of ten passed.
[07:31:18.624 --> 07:31:21.465]  And so, a lot of them were marijuana issues.
[07:31:21.905 --> 07:31:25.226]  That's at least challenging some... Left in the hood up to no good.
[07:31:25.246 --> 07:31:27.506]  A lot of states said no to Obamacare.
[07:31:27.546 --> 07:31:29.767]  Of course, Obama will be in another four years.
[07:31:29.827 --> 07:31:34.408]  That might be an interesting fight, but at least some states are trying to say... No, no, no.
[07:31:34.468 --> 07:31:35.588]  Things are going in a great move.
[07:31:35.608 --> 07:31:39.109]  Tarpley was announcing, the state has come, the state has won.
[07:31:39.509 --> 07:31:41.650]  You're a racist if you don't accept it.
[07:31:42.170 --> 07:31:45.611]  I mean, as if some Valhalla is going to be livered by a new American Soviet.
[07:31:45.931 --> 07:31:47.972]  Hey, I tell you what, are you going to be on the round table on that side?
[07:31:48.532 --> 07:31:49.753]  I think they're saying on this side.
[07:31:49.773 --> 07:31:50.133]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:31:50.173 --> 07:31:51.133]  You get right over here.
[07:31:51.153 --> 07:31:54.714]  We'll keep you on this side, and they can all be over there in that area.
[07:31:54.774 --> 07:31:56.195]  That way we've got plenty of seats here.
[07:31:56.215 --> 07:32:00.337]  And I'm going to punch out this time, because I've been on the airline, I don't know, like 11 hours.
[07:32:01.057 --> 07:32:06.379]  What is, what is like 5.30 roughly when I got on till, uh, till one in the morning?
[07:32:06.839 --> 07:32:07.339]  What is the numbers?
[07:32:07.359 --> 07:32:08.540]  Oh, you're looking at seven and a half hours.
[07:32:08.880 --> 07:32:13.201]  That's seven and a half, and then I had the three on the radio, so that's, uh... You've done well today, Alex.
[07:32:13.302 --> 07:32:13.942]  I have done well.
[07:32:15.049 --> 07:32:16.769]  But I didn't, but I didn't build it.
[07:32:16.829 --> 07:32:17.510]  What was that, Dan?
[07:32:20.070 --> 07:32:37.494]  Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna throw it to Jakari Jackson on the round table in there, and Aaron will come sit right here in the evil Koch brother nest, and we will continue our transmission here while savoring... I don't feel good because of anything I've built or anything I've done in my life.
[07:32:37.554 --> 07:32:44.575]  I'm feeling good because Obama got elected right now, and I'm gonna go watch him, and I'm gonna feel good, Aaron, right now about my accomplishments in life.
[07:32:44.943 --> 07:32:46.224]  This country's in a lot of trouble.
[07:32:46.244 --> 07:32:51.046]  I mean, maybe it is a little bit better because many people already understand how bad Obama is.
[07:32:51.106 --> 07:32:53.067]  I mean, Romney... Well, I'm having a deja vu.
[07:32:53.107 --> 07:32:54.088]  Like, we had this before.
[07:32:54.408 --> 07:32:55.188]  Did we?
[07:32:55.228 --> 07:32:56.449]  Listen, no, no, no.
[07:32:56.469 --> 07:32:57.870]  My God, I had a nightmare about it.
[07:32:58.310 --> 07:32:59.050]  Let's go ahead.
[07:32:59.090 --> 07:32:59.691]  It was a nightmare.
[07:32:59.731 --> 07:33:00.971]  It's like different nightmares.
[07:33:00.991 --> 07:33:06.154]  It's kind of like those... Nightmare where we were talking... It's like those storybooks where, like, it has different endings, but they're all the nightmares.
[07:33:06.174 --> 07:33:10.856]  Like, there's the Romney ending, there's the Obama ending, and... Yeah, it wasn't going to end good tonight.
[07:33:10.896 --> 07:33:11.697]  I mean, we all knew that.
[07:33:12.757 --> 07:33:13.878]  Yeah, but the fact that
[07:33:15.794 --> 07:33:15.894]  It's
[07:33:35.848 --> 07:33:36.329]  I don't know.
[07:33:51.810 --> 07:33:54.253]  This is Obama wins second term.
[07:33:54.854 --> 07:34:03.285]  Voters approve I, what's it, Washington State and we got I-502 to legalize marijuana and that's the Seattle Times.
[07:34:03.926 --> 07:34:06.429]  And I believe we also have another article from Oregon.
[07:34:07.891 --> 07:34:09.493]  So if we can take a look at that.
[07:34:11.841 --> 07:34:19.784]  Okay, but anyway, my understanding, here we go, okay, Oregon stays put on pot while other states may take historic changes.
[07:34:19.824 --> 07:34:30.169]  So Oregon not set to, you know, change their views on pot, but hey, if you like your pots, you can go to Colorado and Washington, not that I'm advocating that kind of deal.
[07:34:30.649 --> 07:34:33.190]  And let's see, Massachusetts voters approve.
[07:34:34.282 --> 07:34:35.803]  Oh, medicinal marijuana.
[07:34:35.823 --> 07:34:37.364]  So there you go.
[07:34:37.844 --> 07:34:40.786]  Now we're going to give the guys in the other studio a chance to get set.
[07:34:40.826 --> 07:34:42.407]  They'll be joining us here in a few minutes.
[07:34:42.847 --> 07:34:45.749]  Aaron Dykes, David Ortiz, I have Melissa Melton here with me.
[07:34:46.109 --> 07:34:50.212]  So we'll go to a short break and be back with the other guys for our roundtable discussion.
[07:34:54.535 --> 07:35:02.420]  I'm President Barack Barry Obama, and you're watching continual coverage of the 2012 presidential election here on InfoWars.com.
[07:35:09.457 --> 07:35:10.258]  Which camera do I look at?
[07:35:10.298 --> 07:35:10.458]  This one?
[07:35:37.705 --> 07:35:45.529]  As we saw in Katrina, and as we are watching now in New York and New Jersey, the federal government can't and won't help you in a crisis.
[07:35:46.149 --> 07:35:48.790]  FEMA ran out of water and MREs in days.
[07:35:49.350 --> 07:35:52.072]  Electricity is still off to over 1 million people.
[07:35:52.652 --> 07:35:56.874]  The Red Cross, who is quick to beg for money, is now slow to react.
[07:35:57.714 --> 07:35:59.455]  Don't put it off any longer.
[07:36:00.215 --> 07:36:01.296]  Get prepared today.

[07:37:17.361 --> 07:37:20.162]  All right, and welcome back to our election coverage.
[07:37:20.282 --> 07:37:25.784]  As you know by now, Barack Obama has been elected president for his second term.
[07:37:26.324 --> 07:37:32.846]  So get ready for four more years of NDAA and Patriot Act and drones.
[07:37:32.926 --> 07:37:39.668]  And if you get hit by a drone, Obama said, if you happen to be in the area, you're an enemy combatant if you're a male of military age.
[07:37:39.948 --> 07:37:43.109]  But anyway, aside from all that, I'm going to go now to Miss Melissa Melton.
[07:37:43.130 --> 07:37:44.330]  How are you doing tonight, Melissa?
[07:37:45.769 --> 07:37:47.430]  Oh, I'm doing okay.
[07:37:47.450 --> 07:37:52.571]  I think Alex summed it up really well when he said it's like the choose your own adventure books except a nightmare.
[07:37:52.591 --> 07:37:53.692]  It's like choose your own nightmare.
[07:37:54.172 --> 07:37:54.372]  Right.
[07:37:54.532 --> 07:37:58.013]  Yeah, so just flip through the pages, pick one, it's all the same.
[07:37:58.493 --> 07:38:02.594]  Now, hearing about the election, did you have any idea which way it was going to go?
[07:38:02.614 --> 07:38:03.575]  Was it going to go Obama?
[07:38:03.615 --> 07:38:04.735]  Was it going to go third party?
[07:38:04.775 --> 07:38:05.755]  Was it going to go Mitt Romney?
[07:38:05.795 --> 07:38:07.756]  What were your thoughts before this night?
[07:38:09.559 --> 07:38:09.959]  I don't know.
[07:38:09.999 --> 07:38:11.281]  I kept going back and forth.
[07:38:12.102 --> 07:38:22.215]  I think towards the end I really thought it was probably going to be Obama just because, I mean, even just a couple days ago we saw on Twitter people were hashtagging, Hail Obama.
[07:38:22.336 --> 07:38:23.657]  Hail Obama was trending.
[07:38:24.298 --> 07:38:26.901]  So that's not even just, I think Obama's awesome.
[07:38:26.921 --> 07:38:28.002]  That's, I hail him.
[07:38:28.022 --> 07:38:29.683]  I'm going to get down on my knees and worship him.
[07:38:29.724 --> 07:38:30.384]  He is my king.
[07:38:30.444 --> 07:38:32.206]  I mean, that was trending on Twitter.
[07:38:32.246 --> 07:38:37.051]  So, but people that I talked to even tonight, it's like, they feel like they know him personally.
[07:38:37.331 --> 07:38:38.272]  He's my president.
[07:38:38.392 --> 07:38:38.953]  I know him.
[07:38:39.033 --> 07:38:39.653]  He's mine.
[07:38:39.693 --> 07:38:40.334]  It's like, what?
[07:38:40.955 --> 07:38:41.315]  Okay.
[07:38:41.335 --> 07:38:44.878]  Yeah, just like we saw the people just moment, there it is right there live.
[07:38:44.899 --> 07:38:48.222]  These people out, what is that Chicago where he's at?
[07:38:49.219 --> 07:38:55.142]  Uh, people out there standing outside, I'm sure it's not the warmest place to be, uh, waving their flags.
[07:38:55.222 --> 07:39:00.285]  And, I mean, hey, your guy won, so, I mean, I can't say anything about it.
[07:39:00.305 --> 07:39:01.585]  They must do a lot of arm reps.
[07:39:01.925 --> 07:39:06.287]  Because those people have been waving flags for, what, like a straight three hours or something?
[07:39:06.327 --> 07:39:06.688]  Just waving?
[07:39:06.708 --> 07:39:07.288]  How about that?
[07:39:08.248 --> 07:39:10.009]  My arm would get tired after about five minutes.
[07:39:10.229 --> 07:39:11.490]  I must not be very dedicated.
[07:39:11.750 --> 07:39:16.133]  Well, if you hear Obama support, I guess that gives you extra strength.
[07:39:16.454 --> 07:39:18.695]  Whenever the guys are ready in the other studio, just let me know.
[07:39:19.076 --> 07:39:20.897]  But for right now, you have a few articles here.
[07:39:21.417 --> 07:39:22.538]  Melissa Melton, what do you have?
[07:39:22.618 --> 07:39:23.079]  Not really.
[07:39:23.119 --> 07:39:30.224]  I was just looking at some of the different ways that Obama and Romney were the same, and some of the things that are going to continue.
[07:39:30.304 --> 07:39:30.905]  I mean, we've got
[07:39:31.485 --> 07:39:39.208]  Unmanned drone strikes, we've got secret kill lists that we know have American citizens on there that Obama has deigned himself the exalter of.
[07:39:39.348 --> 07:39:40.508]  He's just going to control that.
[07:39:40.568 --> 07:39:42.029]  He gets to decide who lives and dies.
[07:39:42.109 --> 07:39:44.269]  No due process, no charge, no trial.
[07:39:45.610 --> 07:39:48.811]  The NDAA, where he can indefinitely detain citizens.
[07:39:48.891 --> 07:39:53.452]  I know he signed a little thing saying he's not going to do that, but I mean, he signs a lot of little things.
[07:39:54.033 --> 07:39:56.594]  He signs a lot of things, he says a lot of things.
[07:39:56.634 --> 07:40:00.695]  We saw the video of him earlier this morning saying that he doesn't lie.
[07:40:01.215 --> 07:40:02.876]  He doesn't, but he cried.
[07:40:02.896 --> 07:40:04.077]  He had like that one tear.
[07:40:04.117 --> 07:40:05.858]  He had a tear.
[07:40:06.539 --> 07:40:07.139]  I don't lie.
[07:40:07.239 --> 07:40:10.161]  I mean, my dear, I don't care if the guy cried or not.
[07:40:10.261 --> 07:40:11.102]  It's what he's saying.
[07:40:11.122 --> 07:40:13.884]  He said, we have to finish what we started.
[07:40:13.924 --> 07:40:15.305]  It's like, no, it's what you started.
[07:40:15.345 --> 07:40:16.125]  It's been four years.
[07:40:16.145 --> 07:40:16.746]  You didn't finish.
[07:40:16.826 --> 07:40:17.586]  What did you finish?
[07:40:18.047 --> 07:40:19.748]  You finished expanding the Patriot Act.
[07:40:19.768 --> 07:40:24.451]  You finished signing NDAA so you can indefinitely detain us and completely throw the Constitution out the window.
[07:40:24.491 --> 07:40:27.053]  You finished signing like a bajillion and a half executive orders.
[07:40:27.393 --> 07:40:27.833]  Exactly.
[07:40:27.873 --> 07:40:36.240]  Now if we can scroll back up, we can put that article back on the screen guys and scroll to the top for the headline, 17-year-old girl included on Obama's secret kill list.
[07:40:36.520 --> 07:40:44.245]  So for everybody that says we make up this stuff that there's no such thing as an Obama secret kill list, you can check that out, just one of many articles.
[07:40:45.426 --> 07:40:47.268]  So definitely take a look at that.
[07:40:47.308 --> 07:40:48.669]  Are we ready in the other studio guys?
[07:40:48.829 --> 07:40:49.849]  Yes, we are here.
[07:40:49.929 --> 07:40:54.473]  Okay, so we're going to throw it now to Aaron Dykes and David Ortiz in our radio studio, guys.
[07:40:55.097 --> 07:40:57.058]  Hey, it's good to talk to you, Jakari and Melissa.
[07:40:57.438 --> 07:40:59.038]  I think you really made a good point there.
[07:40:59.198 --> 07:41:02.220]  So many people identify with who becomes president.
[07:41:02.660 --> 07:41:06.341]  Throughout the 20th century, that's our guy or it's not our guy.
[07:41:06.741 --> 07:41:09.642]  We've got to return to the Constitution, believe in ourselves.
[07:41:09.962 --> 07:41:16.905]  We were never supposed to, in this country, concentrate power in a dictator's hands, but that's what we've built over the years.
[07:41:17.345 --> 07:41:27.978]  Allowing these agencies to build up, allowing ourselves to buy into somebody who doesn't even represent us, may or may not look like us, but really they're doing huge power grabs.
[07:41:28.338 --> 07:41:30.941]  Now, I'll go to David Ortiz in just a second.
[07:41:30.981 --> 07:41:33.224]  Mike Adams has obviously been up on his
[07:41:35.065 --> 07:41:44.391]  He's got a list of 10 dire consequences for Obama's re-election victory, but I guess the asterisk is most of these would apply to Romney as well had he won.
[07:41:44.932 --> 07:41:45.992]  Let me read these real quick.
[07:41:46.052 --> 07:41:49.094]  A huge expansion of TSA in the surveillance state.
[07:41:49.435 --> 07:41:50.255]  You know that's coming.
[07:41:50.295 --> 07:41:55.058]  They want to be in shopping malls, on bus terminals, other transportation.
[07:41:55.078 --> 07:41:57.260]  They're not going away from the airport at this point.
[07:41:57.720 --> 07:42:00.022]  Expansion of secret arrest of Americans.
[07:42:00.062 --> 07:42:02.103]  Y'all were touching on that with the NDAA.
[07:42:02.483 --> 07:42:07.446]  The acceleration of the national debt blowout and endless fiat creation currency.
[07:42:07.466 --> 07:42:13.430]  You've got Ben Bernanke printing tens of billions of dollars a month without any plans to stop.
[07:42:13.810 --> 07:42:16.792]  An expansion of GMOs and USDA collusion.
[07:42:17.152 --> 07:42:19.514]  They did not pass Prop 37 in California.
[07:42:19.574 --> 07:42:20.454]  Really bad news.
[07:42:20.875 --> 07:42:24.157]  Increasing dictatorial government health care control.
[07:42:24.697 --> 07:42:26.818]  Obamacare remains a big issue of course.
[07:42:27.158 --> 07:42:29.658]  Immediate surge in the sale of guns and ammo.
[07:42:29.678 --> 07:42:32.839]  That's definitely something that has been centered around Obama.
[07:42:32.899 --> 07:42:36.080]  He's been called the best gun salesman in history.
[07:42:36.500 --> 07:42:39.821]  And of course an accelerated erosion of the Bill of Rights and Civil Liberties.
[07:42:40.781 --> 07:42:42.922]  Continued destruction and looting of the economy.
[07:42:43.382 --> 07:42:47.943]  Giant sucking sound of employers leaving America because they can't pay Obamacare.
[07:42:48.463 --> 07:42:49.643]  What was your reaction tonight, David?
[07:42:49.663 --> 07:42:51.824]  What do you think are the most important issues?
[07:42:51.844 --> 07:42:53.005]  Overall, what did you see coming?
[07:43:03.723 --> 07:43:06.205]  I was saddened in all honesty.
[07:43:06.846 --> 07:43:10.189]  First off, I thought, I'm shocked that Mitt Romney didn't win.
[07:43:10.229 --> 07:43:11.170]  I mean, it really doesn't matter.
[07:43:11.210 --> 07:43:15.414]  It's just, you know, a different flavor of cyanide had Mitt Romney won.
[07:43:16.075 --> 07:43:21.119]  But I was really saddened because as I went through the Democratic headquarters over in Austin,
[07:43:22.060 --> 07:43:40.651]  People saying, oh he sticks up for me, he sticks up for the little guy, he's going to take care of us, he takes care, well, the reason why you need to be taken care of is because the state has bankrupted you so much, whether it be through the Federal Reserve, the inflation of money, but definitely the welfare state, socialism,
[07:43:41.411 --> 07:43:45.975]  The socialistic mindset, it's becoming part of our fabric, in my estimation.
[07:43:46.435 --> 07:43:48.898]  And I find that to be very, very sad.
[07:43:48.958 --> 07:43:51.860]  Americans now, they definitely want to be taken care of.
[07:43:51.920 --> 07:43:53.421]  And it's not because they're bad people.
[07:43:54.062 --> 07:43:58.946]  It's because, in my estimation, they've been brainwashed and also they've been financially raped.
[07:43:59.106 --> 07:44:00.968]  So now they need the government's assistance.
[07:44:03.132 --> 07:44:05.573]  It's just crazy how much power they have centralized.
[07:44:05.613 --> 07:44:09.095]  Now, I'm going to go back to Jakari and Melissa and let them add their points.
[07:44:09.515 --> 07:44:15.078]  But I do want to get into, in just a moment, 10 states who voted on nullification measures this week.
[07:44:15.198 --> 07:44:17.840]  It was a big article from the Tenth Amendment Center, of course.
[07:44:18.300 --> 07:44:37.991]  It didn't get a lot of play in the media because everyone's been so caught up in Obama versus Romney, but several states voting on whether or not to reject Obamacare and pass their own state limitations on the implementation of health insurance, and a number of states with issues related to marijuana legalizing it.
[07:44:38.511 --> 07:44:44.955]  It passed in both Washington state and Colorado and other states allowing for medical use
[07:44:45.575 --> 07:44:57.742]  Potentially a big blow against the drug war which has just sucked billions and billions and really is leading towards a true warfare state with Mexico, the drug gangs, Fast and Furious plays into that.
[07:44:57.782 --> 07:45:05.206]  There's a lot of issues going on and unfortunately Obama has gotten that mandate to move forward with all the power grabs he's already started.
[07:45:06.004 --> 07:45:06.664]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:45:06.704 --> 07:45:11.825]  I mean, Obama will absolutely imprison you for smoking marijuana, despite the fact that he's done it himself.
[07:45:12.586 --> 07:45:15.226]  But it's good to see that the dominoes are slowly falling.
[07:45:15.266 --> 07:45:24.729]  That's probably, for liberty lovers, the only moral victory I think we've gotten tonight was those marijuana referendums in Oregon and in Washington.
[07:45:24.749 --> 07:45:25.309]  It's good to see.
[07:45:25.349 --> 07:45:29.990]  I think that the marijuana war will soon officially be lost within 10 years.
[07:45:31.434 --> 07:45:33.535]  Yeah, it's probably going to be a turning point.
[07:45:33.795 --> 07:45:36.475]  What did y'all think on the other side over there in the other studio?
[07:45:38.616 --> 07:45:43.557]  Well, you know, Aaron, it's definitely something that some people in our office are very happy about.
[07:45:45.757 --> 07:45:50.679]  The use of marijuana, not just for medicinal purposes, but for recreational use.
[07:45:51.259 --> 07:45:53.159]  And I mean, you know, I'm not a drug advocate.
[07:45:53.199 --> 07:45:55.280]  I've said that on this show many times.
[07:45:56.960 --> 07:46:01.682]  I guess a freedom advocate, I mean, if that's what you choose to do, I mean, that's your choice.
[07:46:01.722 --> 07:46:04.223]  Just like I choose to be a gun owner, that's my thing.
[07:46:04.263 --> 07:46:07.205]  If you choose to smoke marijuana, that's your thing.
[07:46:07.245 --> 07:46:10.886]  Well, Jakari, Jakari, man, it's not about sitting at home and smoking.
[07:46:10.966 --> 07:46:17.469]  It's about the way they've built up the drug war into this huge institution, empowered these very evil drug gangs.
[07:46:17.769 --> 07:46:22.591]  They've killed, like, what, 30,000 people a year in Mexico over this drug war issue.
[07:46:22.891 --> 07:46:26.113]  We've given the federal government all this power to crack down.
[07:46:26.853 --> 07:46:29.395]  And we really need to take that power back and say no.
[07:46:29.575 --> 07:46:33.157]  Individuals need to decide what they're going to do if you're not arming someone.
[07:46:33.177 --> 07:46:34.538]  The correction complex.
[07:46:34.558 --> 07:46:38.660]  Yeah, Aaron, just like you said, I mean, it's this whole war on drugs, which I'm definitely against.
[07:46:38.720 --> 07:46:40.381]  It's been a huge failure.
[07:46:40.401 --> 07:46:43.083]  The prison population exploding.
[07:46:43.363 --> 07:46:49.486]  Yeah, not to mention the large body count and all the money that goes to the black market of these drugs.
[07:46:49.506 --> 07:46:51.868]  So I definitely recognize those as being issues.
[07:46:52.588 --> 07:47:00.211]  Yeah, I hope that the yuppies and the poverty pimps can finally be quiet already with, you know, America being this racist nation.
[07:47:00.791 --> 07:47:04.993]  The poverty pimps and the yuppies were constantly telling us Americans would never vote for a black president.
[07:47:05.053 --> 07:47:05.433]  They did.
[07:47:05.753 --> 07:47:08.494]  Then they said, well, that's because the economy was so horrible.
[07:47:09.054 --> 07:47:10.094]  So they did it out of pity.
[07:47:10.114 --> 07:47:11.395]  They just wanted to break the glass.
[07:47:11.415 --> 07:47:14.276]  Well, they've reelected another African-American president.
[07:47:14.856 --> 07:47:19.178]  And Barack Obama won Iowa today, a heavily Caucasian state.
[07:47:19.958 --> 07:47:24.582]  Um, you know, I just hope that the yuppies and the poverty pimps can stop with this race-baiting.
[07:47:24.982 --> 07:47:31.788]  Racism does exist, but in my estimation, it's greatly over-exaggerated, and I think that's proof that President Barack Obama won today.
[07:47:33.649 --> 07:47:37.912]  You know, another troubling issue, and I'd like to get Charles' response on the other side.
[07:47:37.932 --> 07:47:43.336]  This came out before the election, I guess supposing what if Obama didn't win re-election?
[07:47:43.656 --> 07:47:49.080]  The November surprise where the EPA's planning major post-election anti-coal regulation.
[07:47:49.500 --> 07:47:51.782]  So, sitting in the wings, we've got the EPA,
[07:47:52.282 --> 07:48:03.473]  Already kind of pushed back on regulating the environment, their carbon taxes, all the things they tried to get through the previous House and Senate sessions and failed, they appear to be making new big moves on.
[07:48:04.013 --> 07:48:15.104]  So that's just one of the areas we need to look at in Obama's next term and all his statements about taking guns, not to mention the continued economic collapse, everything else that remains important.
[07:48:15.987 --> 07:48:16.607]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:48:16.648 --> 07:48:22.492]  I mean, President Barack Obama in an interview recently said that our debt is not an imminent threat.
[07:48:23.152 --> 07:48:24.173]  It's not an imminent threat.
[07:48:24.273 --> 07:48:27.475]  So, you know, that shows how out of touch he is.
[07:48:27.615 --> 07:48:32.039]  But, yeah, I mean, in four years it's going to be very interesting to see where we're going to be.
[07:48:32.699 --> 07:48:39.064]  And the Democratic base's argument is it takes eight years to rectify what Bush did, to resolve what Bush did.
[07:48:39.544 --> 07:48:42.186]  So they're really not going to have any excuses after this second term.
[07:48:43.467 --> 07:48:54.018]  You know, Aaron, just like you were talking about on the coal plants, unless you're welcome to chime in on this as well, Obama is very adamant about shutting down these coal-powered plants.
[07:48:54.878 --> 07:49:04.108]  He's already said publicly he wants to bankrupt these people, wants to bankrupt the industry, get these plants out of the U.S., and I think that's definitely going to continue in his next four years.
[07:49:05.165 --> 07:49:09.887]  You know, it's a really complicated issue because I would like to see alternative energy come into play.
[07:49:10.128 --> 07:49:12.089]  I'm not a huge fan of fossil fuels.
[07:49:12.529 --> 07:49:20.413]  At the same time, there have been clean coal plants, but love it or hate it, it's providing 50% or more of our national power.
[07:49:20.753 --> 07:49:27.757]  We've got huge reserves in coal that we can tap, natural gas, and yet we're fighting these foreign wars supposedly for oil.
[07:49:28.317 --> 07:49:39.022]  And for natural resources as well as geopolitical reasons, why can't we find some way to provide our energy at home and not implement it in a way that starves people?
[07:49:39.622 --> 07:49:42.163]  This is an austerity measure to shut down coal plants.
[07:49:42.283 --> 07:49:44.284]  It's a way of saying you're going to pay more for less.
[07:49:44.664 --> 07:49:46.685]  It happened with Enron and the other companies.
[07:49:48.715 --> 07:49:49.195]  Exactly.
[07:49:49.275 --> 07:49:50.736]  I mean, you made an excellent point.
[07:49:50.796 --> 07:49:54.039]  I mean, they have tried alternative forms of energy.
[07:49:54.059 --> 07:49:56.340]  I'm not sure what happened to these big wind farms.
[07:49:56.360 --> 07:49:56.700]  Who was that?
[07:49:57.061 --> 07:50:00.603]  Boone Pickens, who has this big wind farm thing going on.
[07:50:00.643 --> 07:50:04.606]  I'm not sure what happened to that and these alternative things that they had going on.
[07:50:04.646 --> 07:50:08.188]  But just like you said, love it or hate it, that's what we have right now.
[07:50:08.348 --> 07:50:11.030]  And we do have clean coal power plants.
[07:50:11.190 --> 07:50:15.893]  And, you know, Alex always points out this stuff isn't as dangerous as everybody thinks it is.
[07:50:15.913 --> 07:50:18.575]  A lot of this stuff is just condensation that makes it
[07:50:18.635 --> 07:50:19.196]  I don't know.
[07:50:33.697 --> 07:50:37.221]  And they had a whole investigation panel where they asked, why is coal not on here?
[07:50:37.441 --> 07:50:39.423]  And the lady couldn't even answer that question.
[07:50:39.764 --> 07:50:42.267]  And then it was like a week later, they finally added clean coal.
[07:50:42.727 --> 07:50:43.828]  But he didn't even put it on there.
[07:50:43.969 --> 07:50:45.530]  He had no plans to even discuss it.
[07:50:45.991 --> 07:50:52.318]  So even though we do get about 50% of our power in this country from coal still, he wasn't even going to put it on the graphic.
[07:50:54.025 --> 07:50:58.328]  Exactly, and if you're just tuning in, this isn't a Romney love fest.
[07:50:58.368 --> 07:51:03.372]  We're not advocating Mitt Romney or anything like that.
[07:51:03.412 --> 07:51:06.174]  So if you're just tuning in, this is not what it is.
[07:51:06.214 --> 07:51:07.535]  We're not pro-Obama.
[07:51:07.555 --> 07:51:08.716]  We're not pro-Romney.
[07:51:08.856 --> 07:51:12.019]  You know, I myself, I'm not even necessarily concerned.
[07:51:12.179 --> 07:51:14.480]  I mean, convinced by any of the third party candidates.
[07:51:15.060 --> 07:51:27.086]  Myself being an Oklahoma resident, I just recently moved to Texas and still hold Oklahoma residency, so I couldn't write in my vote because I didn't want to vote for either Obama or Romney, so I didn't vote for the presidential cycle.
[07:51:27.146 --> 07:51:29.768]  I voted Jakari, but I skipped that presidential slot.
[07:51:29.788 --> 07:51:32.209]  I just voted for local people that I thought were important.
[07:51:32.614 --> 07:51:33.755]  Yes, that's a good point.
[07:51:33.775 --> 07:51:36.958]  You can still vote for your local issues and local concerns.
[07:51:36.978 --> 07:51:48.628]  I just chose not to vote for the presidency because I didn't have a chance to write in the candidate, which I would have voted for Gary Johnson had I had the chance, but I was not going to vote for Mitt Romney or Barack Obama.
[07:51:50.067 --> 07:52:00.574]  And I would like to hear David's reason, because talking around the office, and not to single him out, but he's one of the few guys who actually thought Romney was going to win.
[07:52:00.834 --> 07:52:05.097]  Not saying that he thought Romney was better or superior, he just thought... David is a staunch Gary Johnson supporter.
[07:52:05.117 --> 07:52:07.879]  Yes, he is a staunch Gary Johnson supporter.
[07:52:08.019 --> 07:52:13.783]  Yeah, he did a couple of big interviews with Gary Johnson, so I was just curious, David, why did you think Mitt Romney was going to win?
[07:52:14.778 --> 07:52:21.841]  Just on the ground floor, I thought the Republican base was really fired up to take this guy out, President Barack Obama.
[07:52:22.262 --> 07:52:26.063]  Everyone I spoke to, even liberals, didn't look very confident.
[07:52:27.364 --> 07:52:32.847]  And so just everyone who I spoke to, and you heard the fire-breathing neocons on the air,
[07:52:33.887 --> 07:52:36.748]  It really looked like the Republicans were going to win.
[07:52:37.108 --> 07:52:40.689]  Also, the economy was bad, so the Democrats didn't have much legs to stand on.
[07:52:40.709 --> 07:52:41.529]  So I'm shocked.
[07:52:41.970 --> 07:52:46.751]  But I'm in the minority, I guess, because everyone around me was saying Obama's going to win.
[07:52:47.291 --> 07:52:49.312]  But I really thought Mitt Romney would win.
[07:52:50.267 --> 07:52:56.111]  You know, I just want to say, though, I think the system really favors two-term presidents because of the tyranny you can get.
[07:52:56.571 --> 07:52:57.972]  Because it goes on autopilot.
[07:52:58.353 --> 07:53:06.218]  Once you're re-elected, people have already kind of identified and formed their opinion on that particular president, and things just move forward.
[07:53:06.258 --> 07:53:07.999]  I mean, look, Reagan had two terms.
[07:53:08.660 --> 07:53:11.742]  Bush failed to get re-elected because of his no-taxes pledge.
[07:53:12.102 --> 07:53:13.603]  But Clinton had two terms.
[07:53:13.803 --> 07:53:15.525]  George W. Bush had two terms.
[07:53:15.865 --> 07:53:18.007]  And now Obama will have two terms.
[07:53:18.547 --> 07:53:22.090]  It's a real way where they can push things forward in a stealth mode.
[07:53:22.170 --> 07:53:23.932]  Very few people are going to pay attention.
[07:53:24.352 --> 07:53:30.197]  Certainly, there will be outcries over something as big as banning guns or granting blanket amnesty.
[07:53:30.557 --> 07:53:33.319]  But at the same time, there's not a mechanism to stop it.
[07:53:33.599 --> 07:53:35.361]  The Democrats are going to have the Senate.
[07:53:35.501 --> 07:53:37.463]  The Republicans are going to control the House.
[07:53:37.523 --> 07:53:38.924]  Last I saw on the issue,
[07:53:39.384 --> 07:53:42.208]  But there's no vote to look forward to.
[07:53:42.589 --> 07:53:47.937]  You don't have to worry about what the population really thinks about it because you've already got those mechanisms of power.
[07:53:48.908 --> 07:53:49.709]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:53:49.769 --> 07:53:53.632]  I mean, the president definitely becomes a celebrity after four years.
[07:53:53.672 --> 07:53:56.735]  I mean, and the power of the bully pulpit really helps him out.
[07:53:57.315 --> 07:54:04.962]  But usually the people who served this one term are people who have done, you know, you hear that phrase, it's the economy stupid, the name of the book.
[07:54:05.683 --> 07:54:10.107]  Well, I mean, I guess it's not about the economy because Barack Obama is our president once again.
[07:54:10.367 --> 07:54:12.849]  You know, Jimmy Carter served one term.
[07:54:12.869 --> 07:54:14.451]  You know, presidents that
[07:54:15.322 --> 07:54:20.784]  You know, really do poor with the economy, don't get a second term, but Barack Obama seems to be the first in modern-day history.
[07:54:22.364 --> 07:54:22.804]  Exactly.
[07:54:22.824 --> 07:54:27.526]  And actually, on our side, we have a few articles on Proposition 37, if you guys can pull that up.
[07:54:28.126 --> 07:54:32.188]  I'd like to take a look at that and let our viewers know what's going on out there in California.
[07:54:32.208 --> 07:54:33.728]  I've got an opinion on that, too.
[07:54:34.588 --> 07:54:39.010]  Okay, while we're pulling up all the articles, Aaron, what was your thought on Proposition 37?
[07:54:39.980 --> 07:54:43.621]  You know, I've just been disgusted because it seemed like a no-brainer issue.
[07:54:43.681 --> 07:54:46.562]  We really need to get labeling in this country.
[07:54:46.842 --> 07:54:55.024]  People have a right to know what's in their food, and right now we have cloaked, hidden, stealth GMOs in almost all the processed foods we have in this country.
[07:54:55.484 --> 07:55:03.045]  Corn, soy, canola, cottonseed oil are all at or around 90% or more of all the products on the U.S.
[07:55:03.085 --> 07:55:03.446]  market.
[07:55:03.486 --> 07:55:09.287]  They're very dominant on the world market as well, and they're mixed into all the pancake mixes or the
[07:55:09.967 --> 07:55:18.870]  Well, I mean, I just, I don't know about pancakes in particular, but all these different products have the corn and soy in particular derivatives in there, and they're almost all GMO.
[07:55:19.230 --> 07:55:32.435]  We really need to know, but we saw the media, fueled by Monsanto, DuPont, Pepsi-Cola, spending 50 million dollars buying up all these papers, writing these hit pieces, saying how ridiculous it was just to label it.
[07:55:33.055 --> 07:55:37.257]  And just today I came across the article where they had set up fake front groups
[07:55:37.677 --> 07:55:39.299]  Do we know what the margin was on that?
[07:55:39.319 --> 07:55:40.420]  Like how bad did it lose?
[07:55:40.440 --> 07:55:41.481]  It was like 58 to 42 last I saw.
[07:55:59.198 --> 07:55:59.418]  Yes.
[07:55:59.659 --> 07:56:04.346]  And at one point, it was more than 60% in favor of labeling in California.
[07:56:04.846 --> 07:56:05.227]  Exactly.
[07:56:05.267 --> 07:56:12.658]  Now, Melissa, you did an article about the labeling of GMOs, talking about how these big companies just want to save you money.
[07:56:12.678 --> 07:56:13.759]  Can you elaborate on that?
[07:56:16.502 --> 07:56:30.559]  You know millions upon millions of dollars and then they put up a prop no on Prop 37 website where basically they told everybody the reason they're doing this is because labeling is going to cost the average Californian family $400 more in groceries a year.
[07:56:32.942 --> 07:56:34.563]  So they're spending millions of dollars.
[07:56:34.583 --> 07:56:39.686]  It makes total sense, right, that they would spend millions of dollars to save the average family $400 a year?
[07:56:39.986 --> 07:56:45.069]  And what exactly... How much money are they going to save people in medical bills after they eat GMO and get cancer?
[07:56:45.089 --> 07:56:45.989]  Exactly.
[07:56:46.109 --> 07:56:50.011]  And what exactly was their rationale that it's going to cost you more money?
[07:56:50.132 --> 07:56:50.992]  Where did that come from?
[07:56:51.132 --> 07:56:58.414]  They paid a firm to do a report, which is basically one of those firms that you buy off that will write whatever report you want.
[07:56:58.454 --> 07:56:59.575]  It didn't really have any basis.
[07:56:59.615 --> 07:57:00.855]  I glanced through the report.
[07:57:00.895 --> 07:57:03.396]  I didn't see anything in there that could really prove anything either way.
[07:57:03.436 --> 07:57:10.418]  But it's the same firm that was hired by soda companies earlier to fight recycling initiatives.
[07:57:10.458 --> 07:57:13.859]  So they basically hire the same firm and they'll write whatever report you want.
[07:57:14.679 --> 07:57:16.385]  They just wrote a report that said it would cost more.
[07:57:16.405 --> 07:57:19.997]  I could go write a report right now that says whatever I want.
[07:57:20.057 --> 07:57:20.720]  It's kind of like that.
[07:57:22.014 --> 07:57:27.596]  I mean, think about over the years how the rules have changed about the ingredients you have to list, the nutritional content.
[07:57:28.117 --> 07:57:38.461]  I don't remember what year, but there was a point in our lifetimes where you had to suddenly list all the percentages and list all the different ingredients, but you somehow don't have to label GMO.
[07:57:38.481 --> 07:57:40.762]  A company changes packaging all the time.
[07:57:41.002 --> 07:57:47.504]  Yeah, whenever they decide it's good for your heart or good for omega-3 oils or something, they change the packaging immediately.
[07:57:49.741 --> 07:57:55.043]  Yeah, it's quite baffling why Prop 37 didn't pass also.
[07:57:55.464 --> 07:57:58.365]  I mean, that was doing relatively well in the polls.
[07:57:58.985 --> 07:58:04.007]  I don't know what it is when people get behind that, you know... A simple matter of $50 million.
[07:58:04.067 --> 07:58:09.070]  Yeah, I know, but it was doing pretty good in the polls up until two weeks ago.
[07:58:10.690 --> 07:58:14.212]  I want to say, though, Dr. Joseph Mercola, we've had him on the program.
[07:58:14.272 --> 07:58:17.774]  He was the lead donator trying to get Prop 37 passed.
[07:58:18.114 --> 07:58:19.575]  He raised over a million dollars.
[07:58:19.635 --> 07:58:20.416]  He's a hero.
[07:58:20.736 --> 07:58:22.057]  He tried to save this country.
[07:58:22.377 --> 07:58:28.341]  So are people like Mike Adams, people like Jeffrey M. Smith, Alex, for the spotlight he's put on the issue.
[07:58:28.661 --> 07:58:42.345]  We're going to have to win this issue because it's going to affect everyone if we keep eating these foods that cause organ damage, gut inflammation, new allergies, sterility, and this passed down infertility.
[07:58:42.365 --> 07:58:46.966]  This could affect everyone in the world if we allow ourselves to keep eating GMOs.
[07:58:47.546 --> 07:58:57.729]  Again, with four staple crops right now, but they're moving towards hundreds of GMO products being approved through these fast-track processes, and the whole idea that they're being tested
[07:58:58.189 --> 07:59:00.070]  For safety is a complete illusion.
[07:59:00.110 --> 07:59:04.952]  The FDA just rubber stamps it and lets these biotech firms do their own test.
[07:59:05.292 --> 07:59:06.013]  And they're all skewed.
[07:59:06.033 --> 07:59:06.813]  I've read the books.
[07:59:07.153 --> 07:59:11.555]  It's a very boring read, but these studies show how skewed these results are.
[07:59:12.916 --> 07:59:13.356]  Exactly.
[07:59:13.396 --> 07:59:17.038]  Now, Melissa and Aaron, you guys both did a report about GMO foods.
[07:59:17.078 --> 07:59:24.362]  For our new viewers who may not be too up on Proposition 37 and what GMO foods are, can you do like a brief analysis of what they are?
[07:59:25.362 --> 07:59:26.583]  On what are GMO foods?
[07:59:27.043 --> 07:59:27.203]  Yes.
[07:59:28.561 --> 07:59:31.702]  Well, genetically modified foods are created in a laboratory.
[07:59:32.122 --> 07:59:36.423]  They isolate genes through bacteria for new traits they want.
[07:59:36.683 --> 07:59:38.404]  Pesticide is the most popular one.
[07:59:38.444 --> 07:59:39.784]  They have some other traits as well.
[07:59:40.465 --> 07:59:54.729]  Plants that are either resistant to pesticides or that produce their own pesticides in every cell of the organism and you eat it and they inject it randomly into the existing plant structures and it causes all kinds of random damage, predictable damage.
[07:59:55.129 --> 07:59:55.369]  Exactly.
[07:59:55.389 --> 07:59:55.590]  Exactly.
[08:00:11.500 --> 08:00:14.902]  Um, actually, that was a really good explanation.
[08:00:15.562 --> 08:00:29.848]  What I was about to bring up, first I just want to say, honestly, I mean, the last .0002% of faith I had in this crumbling, corrupt, broken system was totally dashed tonight on the fact that Proposition 37 did not pass.
[08:00:29.948 --> 08:00:34.230]  Actually, it went around back to having faith in the system, then back around to having zero again.
[08:00:34.270 --> 08:00:36.171]  That's how much I have no faith in this now.
[08:00:36.451 --> 08:00:37.711]  I cannot believe this didn't pass.
[08:00:37.751 --> 08:00:38.792]  I'm completely outraged.
[08:00:39.312 --> 08:00:51.815]  And about a week before Proposition 37 came to the vote, actually I did an article about this, the American Academy of Pediatrics put out a statement saying that organic food is not better for your kids.
[08:00:52.575 --> 08:01:00.477]  And they said that because there are no conclusive scientific studies to show that eating less pesticide is healthy for you, they can't prove that so they can't say that.
[08:01:01.537 --> 08:01:06.480]  If we don't have a scientific study to tell us eating less pesticide is bad for us, then we don't know it.
[08:01:06.560 --> 08:01:07.520]  Yeah, I remember that report.
[08:01:07.540 --> 08:01:08.621]  I actually referenced it.
[08:01:09.741 --> 08:01:10.982]  I don't think that's the one, guys.
[08:01:11.002 --> 08:01:12.503]  But that is a good report.
[08:01:12.563 --> 08:01:14.404]  GMO companies just want to save you money.
[08:01:14.424 --> 08:01:16.325]  That's what Melissa chronicles.
[08:01:18.045 --> 08:01:22.107]  They say they don't want GMO labeling because it will cost you money.
[08:01:22.127 --> 08:01:31.710]  So that's why Monsanto spent $8.1 million to defeat this proposition, which was almost exactly as much as the entire yes to Prop 37 was able to get together.
[08:01:32.270 --> 08:01:32.651]  Exactly.
[08:01:32.671 --> 08:01:33.892]  They want to save you money.
[08:01:34.072 --> 08:01:34.713]  That's why.
[08:01:34.793 --> 08:01:35.394]  They love you.
[08:01:35.494 --> 08:01:35.935]  That's why.
[08:01:36.255 --> 08:01:42.563]  This is Emperor Obama's big night, so I don't want to focus on something else other than Obama and his glory, but I do want to point out... That's true.
[08:01:42.643 --> 08:01:43.504]  I do love Obama.
[08:01:43.664 --> 08:01:44.445]  Yeah, exactly.
[08:01:44.525 --> 08:01:46.968]  There's another front in this battle, and it remains the
[08:01:47.108 --> 08:01:47.829]  Consumer Choice
[08:02:07.009 --> 08:02:12.692]  You name it, starting to market towards these healthy foods saying now truth, honest foods.
[08:02:12.972 --> 08:02:28.499]  They know people crave that, but there's still another level of deception that we've got to educate people on and start to drive consumer forces to reject natural brands unless they certify they don't contain GMOs and to accept and promote more organic foods.
[08:02:29.159 --> 08:02:34.962]  Well, are there any other states on the horizon that have talked about having a similar referendum as California did today?
[08:02:35.817 --> 08:02:36.658]  That's a great question.
[08:02:36.698 --> 08:02:37.939]  I don't have that answer for you.
[08:02:37.959 --> 08:02:39.140]  Massachusetts tried.
[08:02:40.380 --> 08:02:45.244]  Massachusetts, I believe it was, was it Massachusetts that tried, but then they got threatened with a lawsuit by Monsanto.
[08:02:45.264 --> 08:02:46.205]  Was it Vermont maybe?
[08:02:46.625 --> 08:02:47.165]  Oh, Vermont.
[08:02:47.186 --> 08:02:47.626]  That was right.
[08:02:47.706 --> 08:02:48.246]  It was Vermont.
[08:02:48.306 --> 08:02:48.867]  It was Vermont.
[08:02:49.527 --> 08:02:49.887]  That's right.
[08:02:49.908 --> 08:02:50.808]  It's a late night, so who knows.
[08:02:51.289 --> 08:02:53.170]  Yeah, it's been a long day, sorry.
[08:02:53.330 --> 08:02:59.094]  Speaking of Emperor Obama, just on a very conversational level, where do you think he's going to bring the country?
[08:02:59.114 --> 08:03:02.657]  What do you think the country will be in four years as a result of his administration?
[08:03:03.237 --> 08:03:03.818]  Police state.
[08:03:05.935 --> 08:03:09.277]  So we have war, police state, what do you guys think over there?
[08:03:09.497 --> 08:03:10.878]  I think we're going to turn this thing around.
[08:03:10.918 --> 08:03:15.680]  I think we're all going to have nice fat wallets and return to good times.
[08:03:15.700 --> 08:03:18.662]  Eat some GMO, drink some fluoride.
[08:03:18.682 --> 08:03:21.904]  Do you think we're going to see a war with Iran or like a major war?
[08:03:23.553 --> 08:03:25.694]  I don't know about a major war.
[08:03:25.774 --> 08:03:28.036]  I think he's definitely going to crack down here at home.
[08:03:28.816 --> 08:03:36.982]  Like I said, we have things such as the Patriot Act, the NDAA, we have domestic drones, wiretapping.
[08:03:37.382 --> 08:03:40.784]  He admits openly that he's coming for your guns.
[08:03:40.804 --> 08:03:44.446]  I don't know why Obama supporters keep saying he's not coming for your guns.
[08:03:44.486 --> 08:03:47.568]  He said openly in the debate he's coming for your guns.
[08:03:47.628 --> 08:03:48.409]  I don't know what else.
[08:03:48.869 --> 08:03:51.553]  Yeah, I mean, somebody's saying, yeah, I'm gonna rob this bank.
[08:03:51.913 --> 08:04:06.291]  You know, I gotta say, Obama and Hillary are kind of masters, and the other guys that work in their administration, masters of disguising war as these smaller proxy conflicts, as these regional things, Libya, Syria, you name it.
[08:04:06.852 --> 08:04:18.464]  Yeah, humanitarian actions, kinetic actions, whereas Bush really had to take heat for the Iraq war, not so much for the Afghanistan war, but they were known as wars, as illegitimate wars, and you name it.
[08:04:18.504 --> 08:04:30.516]  But even going back to the Clinton administration, those guys, very similarly to the Obama administration, were great at disguising it, yeah, as humanitarian, as a small-scale proxy thing, like, well, we're going to intervene.
[08:04:31.156 --> 08:04:32.297]  And change a few factors.
[08:04:32.317 --> 08:04:34.378]  But let's not get into calling it a war.
[08:04:34.438 --> 08:04:36.458]  It's not something the US is engaged in.
[08:04:36.819 --> 08:04:39.500]  So they get a lot more done with smaller chess pieces.
[08:04:39.940 --> 08:04:42.121]  Now whether or not they're going to bite off Iran, we don't know.
[08:04:42.161 --> 08:04:45.442]  There's been serious war games run by Israel.
[08:04:45.683 --> 08:04:49.965]  One that the scenario takes place a few days after today, the election.
[08:04:50.665 --> 08:04:53.246]  And whether or not something like that could happen, we don't know.
[08:04:53.266 --> 08:04:54.146]  It'd be horrendous.
[08:04:54.467 --> 08:04:56.948]  And that's an issue that has to be addressed immediately.
[08:04:57.128 --> 08:04:59.609]  I mean, that's no longer an issue that we can tippy-toe around.
[08:05:00.229 --> 08:05:06.451]  Either we gotta let it go or the neocons are gonna pressure Obama to do something.
[08:05:07.051 --> 08:05:10.632]  And he has stated he hasn't taken military strikes off the table.
[08:05:10.692 --> 08:05:14.534]  That is an issue that will absolutely be addressed thoroughly in his next administration.
[08:05:17.155 --> 08:05:24.177]  I actually had somebody argue with me tonight that the President of the United States does not need Congress to declare war.
[08:05:24.867 --> 08:05:27.290]  Well, he's been saying that for a while now.
[08:05:27.370 --> 08:05:29.632]  I mean, so his supporters feel that way.
[08:05:30.273 --> 08:05:31.674]  So he's got them believing it.
[08:05:31.695 --> 08:05:39.623]  And it's just one of those things, I mean, when I try to explain this to people, it doesn't matter if you're for Obama or Romney or if you're for Bush or Kerry or whoever else.
[08:05:40.104 --> 08:05:45.730]  I mean, once you give these powers to a president, Barack Obama is not going to be president forever, at least we hope.
[08:05:46.670 --> 08:05:47.310]  We're good to go.
[08:06:09.517 --> 08:06:10.878]  People always protect their party.
[08:06:26.457 --> 08:06:28.178]  Exactly, whenever there's a violation.
[08:06:28.198 --> 08:06:30.980]  I was speaking to people today about NDAA, the Patriot Act.
[08:06:32.401 --> 08:06:34.322]  And I said, you know, Mitt Romney supports these things.
[08:06:34.342 --> 08:06:35.162]  What do you think about it?
[08:06:35.222 --> 08:06:35.943]  Oh, that's horrible.
[08:06:35.983 --> 08:06:36.823]  That's terrible.
[08:06:36.883 --> 08:06:38.324]  That's one reason why I didn't vote for him.
[08:06:38.684 --> 08:06:39.905]  And I would say, well, so does Obama.
[08:06:40.345 --> 08:06:44.068]  And then they hummed and hawed and they said, well, you know, he's the lesser of two evils.
[08:06:44.188 --> 08:06:46.129]  You know, people just, they really cuddled.
[08:06:46.149 --> 08:06:47.350]  How did they like voting for evil?
[08:06:48.530 --> 08:06:49.351]  Yeah, exactly.
[08:06:50.819 --> 08:06:51.579]  I asked people that.
[08:06:52.100 --> 08:06:54.541]  So they kept saying, it's the lesser of two evils, you know.
[08:06:54.561 --> 08:06:56.161]  I gotta vote for this.
[08:06:56.461 --> 08:06:58.262]  Romney's the lesser of two evils, I got told.
[08:06:58.642 --> 08:07:00.883]  And it's like, how do you like voting for evil?
[08:07:00.903 --> 08:07:02.304]  Because that's what you're doing.
[08:07:02.364 --> 08:07:04.505]  It's the evil of two lessers, to quote Dead Prez.
[08:07:09.254 --> 08:07:18.366]  One thing that I definitely see, one direction I definitely see this country going, and absolutely I see it happening, is the nanny state with food.
[08:07:19.287 --> 08:07:21.550]  That's a big, that's a big liberal...
[08:07:23.052 --> 08:07:31.117]  You know, Tenet, you see it with Michael Bloomberg, you see it with Michelle Obama, telling people what they can digest.
[08:07:31.497 --> 08:07:35.539]  And now with the health care plan, that's one thing I'm very concerned about.
[08:07:35.579 --> 08:07:40.322]  The nanny state with food is really going to grow over the next four years.
[08:07:41.423 --> 08:07:47.146]  I recently did a report on that, not to cut you off there, Aaron.
[08:07:47.166 --> 08:08:05.437]  We played an excerpt of it earlier tonight, when you interviewed the gentleman, David, at the Democratic Party, where we showed the footage of a school, well not a school, several schools in Chicago, where students actually had to shift through rodent droppings to eat their school lunches, and we're not going to cut to it now.
[08:08:05.817 --> 08:08:10.879]  For the sake of time, but you are definitely correct in that that the nanny state is going to tighten up on what you're going to eat.
[08:08:10.919 --> 08:08:12.979]  And what were you about to say, Aaron?
[08:08:13.039 --> 08:08:14.320]  Yeah, I kind of had a mouthful.
[08:08:14.380 --> 08:08:16.660]  I mean, it's maybe beyond the scope, but you're right.
[08:08:16.700 --> 08:08:21.362]  There's a very big problem with food, which I think we probably take it for granted in our life.
[08:08:21.802 --> 08:08:31.925]  But when socialist dictators in particular or any centralized system takes over food, there's always shortages when they try to control the supply and dictate who's going to produce it.
[08:08:32.285 --> 08:08:39.528]  There's been starvations not only from Stalin and Mao and other key dictators in the 20th century, but throughout history.
[08:08:39.548 --> 08:08:48.792]  I was reading up on the French Illuminati and when Robespierre took over, he declared two-thirds of the population of France to be enemies who were to be exterminated.
[08:08:49.092 --> 08:08:50.733]  He wanted to kill 14 to 15 million French people.
[08:08:52.914 --> 08:09:02.763]  After and because he took control of the food supply, told people who could grow, who could sell, and they found in most cases when the free market produces food, there's an abundance.
[08:09:02.783 --> 08:09:08.027]  You get export money on food, but when you take over with state controls, anyway, it's a big issue.
[08:09:08.047 --> 08:09:15.814]  But you're right, and we've been subsidizing corn and other food production, paying farmers not to grow in this country, all to produce what?
[08:09:15.934 --> 08:09:19.797]  Junk food that's now GMO, that's put into Doritos bags and stuff?
[08:09:19.817 --> 08:09:20.638]  This is not food.
[08:09:21.338 --> 08:09:26.162]  And it's definitely beyond the scope of Obama or Romney, but I think it is a big issue.
[08:09:27.223 --> 08:09:34.029]  It definitely is, and actually we're coming to the end of our segment here, so I'd like to pose one last question to the roundtable.
[08:09:34.669 --> 08:09:35.990]  Third-party candidates.
[08:09:36.050 --> 08:09:40.294]  I know David, you're an avid third-party guy, so what were your thoughts?
[08:09:40.774 --> 08:09:44.977]  I believe it was 2% split between all the third-party candidates.
[08:09:45.318 --> 08:09:46.278]  How'd you feel about that?
[08:09:47.239 --> 08:09:48.619]  I felt so horrible.
[08:09:48.979 --> 08:09:50.400]  I felt so horrible, but you know what?
[08:09:50.660 --> 08:09:58.522]  I actually, I still have faith and sadly I think the advancement is going to be made within the Republican Party.
[08:09:59.022 --> 08:10:05.703]  I think that a Ron Paul-like Libertarian will run as a Republican in four years.
[08:10:05.783 --> 08:10:11.725]  So I don't, I think third party candidates sadly, sadly don't have a future in this country.
[08:10:11.745 --> 08:10:16.706]  But I do think the Libertarian movement within the Republican Party does have a future in this country.
[08:10:18.836 --> 08:10:23.338]  I could jump in and read something Chris Matthews said when he called third party voters idiots.
[08:10:23.378 --> 08:10:25.039]  He said if you don't vote, you're an idiot.
[08:10:25.539 --> 08:10:33.802]  And if you're one of those who voted for a numbskull third or fourth party candidate like Gary Johnson or Jill Stein and say, oh, a surprise at what happened.
[08:10:33.882 --> 08:10:40.645]  No, you shouldn't be because idiots like you voted for third and fourth party candidates and they don't know how the system works.
[08:10:40.985 --> 08:10:42.406]  You have two choices.
[08:10:42.846 --> 08:10:44.027]  I mean, that's a game system.
[08:10:44.047 --> 08:10:45.047]  That's a dictatorship.
[08:10:45.087 --> 08:10:46.788]  Aren't they supposed to be the party of choice?
[08:10:48.371 --> 08:10:49.152]  Coke or Pepsi?
[08:10:49.352 --> 08:10:52.594]  Yeah, I mean, I thought they were supposed to be the party of choice.
[08:10:52.675 --> 08:10:54.556]  Aren't they supposed to be liberals also?
[08:10:54.616 --> 08:10:55.417]  That means freedom?
[08:10:56.077 --> 08:10:57.899]  So, uh, they're not liberal.
[08:10:57.959 --> 08:10:59.260]  They don't want you to have a choice.
[08:11:00.482 --> 08:11:01.584]  There's no freedom in America.
[08:11:01.604 --> 08:11:02.985]  You don't get to have a choice in America.
[08:11:03.025 --> 08:11:07.611]  You just get to be stuck in a two-party system, in this left-right paradigm.
[08:11:07.631 --> 08:11:08.392]  And that's all you get.
[08:11:08.432 --> 08:11:09.954]  You get two choices.
[08:11:09.974 --> 08:11:14.820]  And there's another horrible comment that he said later on in that article.
[08:11:14.840 --> 08:11:15.561]  Do you have that there?
[08:11:15.581 --> 08:11:19.746]  I think there's a stub, but... I think everything he says is a horrible comment.
[08:11:21.348 --> 08:11:22.229]  Very well said.
[08:11:22.409 --> 08:11:25.790]  And while he's looking that up, I just want to point out, this was not a close election.
[08:11:25.870 --> 08:11:30.093]  Obama took it easily, so the focus was taken away from potential voter fraud.
[08:11:30.453 --> 08:11:32.914]  And yet, this was a very messy election.
[08:11:33.254 --> 08:11:45.220]  A lot of abnormalities went on, a lot of new provisional ballot measures, a lot of new policies going on, and probably a lot of election fraud with these electronic voting machines.
[08:11:45.780 --> 08:11:51.983]  And they were putting a focus on Ohio, saying that could, a very close vote, and that that could be fraud.
[08:11:52.043 --> 08:11:56.645]  Well, the Secretary of State in question, their website did go down.
[08:11:57.006 --> 08:12:00.067]  There was contested results over that vote.
[08:12:00.447 --> 08:12:01.908]  And there's been lawsuits filed.
[08:12:02.148 --> 08:12:10.472]  And while there may not be a lot of focus on that, because Obama clearly did win re-election in terms of Obama versus Romney, we probably do have some big issues.
[08:12:10.512 --> 08:12:11.833]  They may recount Florida.
[08:12:12.193 --> 08:12:15.868]  New Jersey and New York, at least parts of them, are still outstanding because of the storms.
[08:12:17.219 --> 08:12:17.599]  Exactly.
[08:12:18.139 --> 08:12:20.080]  David, did you find that quote you were looking for?
[08:12:20.140 --> 08:12:21.341]  No, I didn't.
[08:12:21.401 --> 08:12:25.883]  It was another quote that Chris Matthews had stated.
[08:12:26.383 --> 08:12:29.744]  We'll have to catch up on that tomorrow.
[08:12:29.784 --> 08:12:31.345]  That's it for our show tonight.
[08:12:31.365 --> 08:12:32.265]  We are out of time.
[08:12:32.285 --> 08:12:34.006]  Definitely want to thank everybody.
[08:12:34.026 --> 08:12:40.809]  Aaron Dykes, Melissa Melson, David Ortiz, David Knight, Alex Jones himself, all the great guests that popped in.
[08:12:40.849 --> 08:12:41.189]  Webster Tarpley.
[08:12:41.209 --> 08:12:42.570]  We definitely appreciate your time.
[08:12:42.610 --> 08:12:43.430]  Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[08:12:45.171 --> 08:12:45.751]  I think so.
[08:13:15.491 --> 08:13:16.713]  Check out the Info Wars shop.
[08:13:16.753 --> 08:13:18.154]  Many great products on there.
[08:13:18.775 --> 08:13:22.479]  You can check out the Obama Deception and also Dreams My Real Father.
[08:13:22.519 --> 08:13:24.681]  Something that you're going to need over the next four years.
[08:13:25.102 --> 08:13:27.824]  So definitely get that for your loved ones.
[08:13:27.885 --> 08:13:28.966]  They are both on sale.
[08:13:28.986 --> 08:13:31.408]  You can get them both together for 20 bucks.
[08:13:31.789 --> 08:13:35.613]  So for the Info Wars Nightly News, I'm Ja'Kari Jackson and we'll see you back tomorrow night.

[08:14:02.119 --> 08:14:06.022]  Don't worry about it.
[08:14:55.565 --> 08:14:58.288]  We live from Arkansas.
[08:14:58.368 --> 08:15:05.094]  The point is, we've got Appropriate right there on the counter.
[08:15:05.114 --> 08:15:09.599]  The point is, is that 10% off, no one offers that.
[08:15:09.639 --> 08:15:13.843]  Now we're offering 15 just this week.
