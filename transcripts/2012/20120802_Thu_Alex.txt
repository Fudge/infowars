[00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:09.739]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:11.320]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.862]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:17.065]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:21.149]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:46.197]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, and it is another worldwide broadcast today.
[00:00:46.197 --> 00:00:50.479]  I want to thank you all for joining me.
[00:00:50.479 --> 00:01:02.144]  We're going to be here for the next three hours, and we have a very important transmission lined up for you.
[00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:04.284]  Guaranteed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:05.785]  Guaranteed.
[00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:07.606]  Important broadcast lined up for you.
[00:01:08.462 --> 00:01:20.770]  Bernadine Smith has been one of the most on-target researchers into the global crime syndicate that we've ever interviewed, and she hasn't been on with us in about a decade.
[00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.172]  I don't know, six, seven, eight years.
[00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:23.672]  I don't remember.
[00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:24.513]  It seems like a decade.
[00:01:24.513 --> 00:01:25.834]  I think it probably has been a decade.
[00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:29.456]  Seems like 2002 might have been the last time she was on with us.
[00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:35.320]  So she's going to be on the broadcast today, and she has sent me these three big giant
[00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:39.436]  We're good to go.
[00:01:54.482 --> 00:02:02.165]  But this is very, very important information dealing with the World Government Takeover Plan that has been in place since the 1930s.
[00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:04.906]  And they're following the same program.
[00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:06.786]  They're basically in control of the planet now.
[00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:08.907]  They're just mopping up resistance.
[00:02:08.907 --> 00:02:11.248]  And how this unofficial U.S.
[00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:15.950]  law and global memorandums deals with the total disarmament of the American people.
[00:02:16.758 --> 00:02:20.480]  I have three different big folders, and they are nothing less than mind-blowing.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:32.426]  We have the New York Times in here, back in the 30s, going over how there'd be nine FEMA regions, not ten.
[00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:36.367]  It is just unbelievable, the research and information.
[00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:42.450]  And I'll be honest with you, she sent me one of these folders about 14 years ago,
[00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:45.796]  And I loaned it to somebody.
[00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:51.581]  If memory serves, when I asked for it back, they said they didn't know what I was talking about.
[00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:58.666]  But she was kind enough to hand-make these for us and send these back to us.
[00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:01.788]  So, we're definitely going to do some other special reports on it.
[00:03:01.788 --> 00:03:11.576]  Here's an actual copy of 7277, where they say they're going to take all of our firearms, how they're going to disarm our military and only have the U.N.
[00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:12.477]  military get bigger.
[00:03:14.088 --> 00:03:22.490]  She's got all the original news articles back when they were introducing this like it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.132]  So that is just some of what we are going to be covering here today.
[00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:29.972]  I'm trying to find that New York Times.
[00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:34.974]  I was showing one of the guys this earlier and then it flipped right to it.
[00:03:34.974 --> 00:03:37.034]  Now I'm looking for it and can't find it.
[00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:39.275]  She's going to be joining us coming up in the
[00:03:41.613 --> 00:03:49.635]  Second hour today and the maker of Behold a Pale Horse that's got Charlie Daniels in it.
[00:03:49.635 --> 00:03:51.296]  It's very informative.
[00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:58.818]  He's going to be joining us for 30 minutes at the end of the transmission today.
[00:03:58.818 --> 00:04:07.180]  Obviously, when we come back from break, we will get into the news and information for you and
[00:04:09.196 --> 00:04:30.177]  I will attempt to not go into a rage on air or anything because I've been psychoanalyzing myself and I'm just constantly overwhelmed with anger by all the news and information and frustration in that the brain can instantly understand something and have a full analysis of it.
[00:04:30.177 --> 00:04:31.659]  How do you present that to people?
[00:04:32.818 --> 00:04:36.101]  I'm like a robot with smoke coming out my ears here.
[00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:40.584]  And the public more and more is either waking up or going into trance states.
[00:04:40.584 --> 00:04:42.926]  And so many of the public are in quasi-trance states.
[00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:44.508]  It's just, it's freaking me out.
[00:04:44.508 --> 00:04:48.050]  Television freaks me out.
[00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.652]  It's insane, the system we're living in.
[00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:52.073]  All right, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:52.073 --> 00:04:54.155]  We'll be back with all the news.
[00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:54.996]  Not fit to print.
[00:05:00.094 --> 00:05:05.595]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:08.016]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:17.098]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:17.098 --> 00:05:20.559]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:22.240]  There's no priming required.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.500]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.021]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:29.602]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:31.023]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:05:31.023 --> 00:05:34.185]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:37.568]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:41.711]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:44.453]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:05:44.453 --> 00:05:46.034]  It's what my family uses.
[00:05:46.034 --> 00:05:49.336]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:05:49.336 --> 00:05:54.600]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.783]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:05:58.783 --> 00:06:01.224]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.224 --> 00:06:06.808]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:06:06.808 --> 00:06:11.831]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:06:11.831 --> 00:06:16.855]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:22.619]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:24.920]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.743]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:06:29.743 --> 00:06:30.844]  And here's the best part.
[00:06:30.844 --> 00:06:33.926]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:37.549]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:40.731]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:42.952]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:43.873]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:48.956]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:06:48.956 --> 00:06:56.578]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:06:56.578 --> 00:06:59.540]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeaBank.com.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:06.062]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:07:06.062 --> 00:07:08.643]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:07:08.643 --> 00:07:13.685]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:07:14.025 --> 00:07:18.991]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:07:18.991 --> 00:07:26.659]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:30.523]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:07:30.523 --> 00:07:32.045]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:36.308]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:07:36.308 --> 00:07:39.230]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.012]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[00:07:42.012 --> 00:07:46.575]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:07:46.575 --> 00:07:47.216]  Don't wait!
[00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:49.097]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:49.097 --> 00:07:50.678]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:52.199]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[00:08:01.727 --> 00:08:08.353]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:21.063]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.063 --> 00:08:26.467]  All right, my friends, we are kicking off another worldwide transmission here.
[00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:33.034]  And we're going to have Bernadine Smith on with us coming up in the second hour.
[00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:35.656]  She's been fighting the globalists for more than four decades.
[00:08:35.656 --> 00:08:50.987]  She is probably the preeminent expert who first exposed Agenda 21, the UN global governance takeover, the fact that our own government created the UN, and they have a public plan to disarm us, end the family, bring in foreign troops.
[00:08:50.987 --> 00:08:54.349]  Of course, that all sounded crazy decades ago when she was talking about it.
[00:08:54.349 --> 00:08:55.851]  Now it's all out in the open.
[00:08:56.783 --> 00:09:03.765]  Of course, here's the deal with Bernadine Smith of the Second Amendment group.
[00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:06.606]  She documents everything meticulously.
[00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:07.466]  I don't have one.
[00:09:07.466 --> 00:09:09.367]  I don't have two.
[00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:15.849]  I have three giant binders that she mailed me.
[00:09:15.849 --> 00:09:18.670]  Now, she did this again over a decade ago.
[00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.611]  And I loaned them to somebody and they didn't give them back.
[00:09:21.611 --> 00:09:23.051]  Well, you're not getting these, okay?
[00:09:23.051 --> 00:09:25.112]  I'll tell the folks I loaned the other ones to, you're not getting these.
[00:09:26.946 --> 00:09:40.830]  This has the New York Times in the 30s calling for world government, nine FEMA regions, not 10, how they're going to get rid of the military, how they're going to get rid of the family, LA Times, State Department documents, congressional record.
[00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.031]  It is insane.
[00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:45.152]  The treasure trove of these.
[00:09:45.152 --> 00:09:46.232]  In fact, I'm going to talk to her.
[00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:49.233]  We've got to digitize this.
[00:09:49.233 --> 00:09:53.254]  We've got to digitize this and put it out as a PDF for people.
[00:09:53.254 --> 00:09:55.375]  Because, I mean, there's three of them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:58.274 --> 00:10:00.415]  Was three of them, I just spilt something on it.
[00:10:00.415 --> 00:10:03.437]  I tell you what, boy.
[00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:10.922]  Anyways, so here you have just all of this off the charts.
[00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:13.843]  Incredible!
[00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:18.666]  Absolutely incredible information.
[00:10:18.666 --> 00:10:20.648]  Now, I want to queue up the winner.
[00:10:21.812 --> 00:10:24.834]  A lot of it's just music, but we'll queue up a few minutes of this.
[00:10:24.834 --> 00:10:27.595]  The winner, the $10,000 winner of the Obama Dictator Contest.
[00:10:42.825 --> 00:10:49.290]  And the winners are Infowarriors land a direct hit on dictator Obama in person.
[00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.473]  Obama drives by and acknowledges the sign saying he's dictator scum.
[00:10:53.473 --> 00:10:59.658]  They got it on the local news and just had an overall devastating effect.
[00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:04.201]  And so they are the winners.
[00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:08.625]  And I, in the future, will put together a whole news piece properly giving credit
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.820]  to these folks.
[00:11:40.219 --> 00:11:45.784]  Coming up, but right now, we're going to play a few minutes for radio listeners.
[00:11:45.784 --> 00:11:48.886]  We'll also post this up at Infowars.com in the winter.
[00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:53.890]  Infowarriors Land Direct hit on Dictator Obama in person.
[00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:54.471]  Here is the winner.
[00:11:54.471 --> 00:11:55.531]  You get $10,000.
[00:11:55.531 --> 00:12:01.857]  So we'll need to get your contact info and get that check written to you by Monday or so.
[00:12:01.857 --> 00:12:04.959]  We'll even do it tomorrow if we get the info in.
[00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:06.841]  And I'm going to play this and then come back.
[00:12:07.947 --> 00:12:11.949]  And I'm going to clean the raw milk up off of the documents.
[00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:13.609]  Almost threw the glass through the wall.
[00:12:13.609 --> 00:12:15.550]  I am in a controlled rage right now.
[00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.831]  That's why we're even going to this video now.
[00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:21.252]  I don't think anyone even knows that just happened, even though I'm talking about it on air.
[00:12:21.252 --> 00:12:22.873]  And we will be right back.
[00:12:22.873 --> 00:12:23.293]  Stay with us.
[00:12:48.663 --> 00:12:50.265]  Obama deception?
[00:12:50.265 --> 00:12:57.931]  It's about how Obama lied about all the things he was campaigning for?
[00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:29.280]  No thanks.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:35.363]  About how he lied about how he got in the office?
[00:13:35.363 --> 00:13:48.229]  What he said he was going to do?
[00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:57.428]  We're good to go.
[00:14:20.874 --> 00:14:30.340]  It's called the Obama Deception, about how Obama lied about everything that he ran for.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:30.800]  What?
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.022]  I said fuck him, he did lie about everything.
[00:14:34.022 --> 00:14:34.902]  Woah.
[00:14:34.902 --> 00:14:35.743]  Oh my god!
[00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:58.517]  Okay, it doesn't translate too well over radio, I know, but there it is.
[00:14:58.517 --> 00:15:00.498]  The video's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:00.498 --> 00:15:02.039]  They are the winners.
[00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:07.662]  And again, I'm not really doing justice to anybody here that was part of this contest.
[00:15:07.662 --> 00:15:09.423]  It was amazing.
[00:15:09.423 --> 00:15:22.811]  And thousands of people in Phase 1 and Phase 2, total over a thousand, hung banners up all over the country against President Obama and his dictatorial actions, which shows a physical resistance and really freaks the system out.
[00:15:24.608 --> 00:15:33.691]  All over the country, there are reports of people on their business signs telling Obama that you didn't build my business, you piece of filth.
[00:15:33.691 --> 00:15:35.671]  They're even making comments like that.
[00:15:35.671 --> 00:15:42.613]  And it's good to defile these puppets, because we're meant to worship these puppets and worship government, and it's the opposite.
[00:15:42.613 --> 00:15:46.554]  In a free system, you disdain and distrust government.
[00:15:46.554 --> 00:15:51.956]  But when you're told to worship government all day, you're moving closer to a North Korean-style society.
[00:15:53.988 --> 00:15:56.009]  That's what's going on here.
[00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:58.450]  That's what's happening.
[00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.391]  Now, we have some really good news here.
[00:16:01.391 --> 00:16:14.757]  I just instinctively last week said, you know what, even if people out there don't agree with the owner of Chick-fil-A's view on same-sex marriage, you should really be freaked out.
[00:16:16.499 --> 00:16:21.961]  By calls in Chicago and Boston, the city's saying, we're gonna shut you down.
[00:16:21.961 --> 00:16:25.703]  Like the mafia, we don't like your views, we're gonna shut you down.
[00:16:25.703 --> 00:16:29.345]  Again, that's directly out of Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.
[00:16:29.345 --> 00:16:31.105]  That's really scary.
[00:16:31.105 --> 00:16:32.926]  I mean, I can't believe they're that brazen.
[00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:37.348]  But they're training us, just like when they have police all over the country.
[00:16:37.348 --> 00:16:42.510]  Prosecutors get up on the news and say, if you talk bad about Obama, we're gonna arrest you.
[00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:43.671]  Because we say it's a lie.
[00:16:45.575 --> 00:16:50.320]  They can only operate like this because so much of the public doesn't know which end is up.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.224]  And I made the point that even though I don't like fast food, I would have to go to Chick-fil-A.
[00:16:55.224 --> 00:16:56.586]  Their breakfast is okay.
[00:16:56.586 --> 00:17:00.890]  I'm not really into MSG dipped chicken.
[00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.191]  Talk about an assault on people.
[00:17:02.191 --> 00:17:05.635]  But as for fast food goes, they have clean, nice facilities.
[00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:12.331]  If I'm out on the road somewhere and there's nothing to eat but fast food on the road, I'll eat Chick-fil-A.
[00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:16.315]  Nothing to do with the fact that it's closed on Sunday and the guy's a devout Christian.
[00:17:16.315 --> 00:17:30.869]  But my entire office and everybody else I know has been going to Chick-fil-A now and it's being reported on all over the news that they have long lines and ran out of chicken yesterday, breaking a world record.
[00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:33.519]  Because people are there.
[00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.261]  This is setting off a culture war.
[00:17:35.261 --> 00:17:36.622]  And see, that's what I'm saying.
[00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:47.232]  The globalists are a tiny... And we're showing photos and news articles right now on screen if you're looking at prisonplanet.tv of lions out the door.
[00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:53.819]  The globalists get up there on the Olympics and want to show men humping each other and women kissing each other.
[00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:55.601]  And it's not even an attack on
[00:17:57.011 --> 00:18:04.036]  People of that persuasion to say, don't show sex to kids, don't push an agenda.
[00:18:04.036 --> 00:18:06.738]  That's creepy.
[00:18:06.738 --> 00:18:07.758]  That's really creepy.
[00:18:07.758 --> 00:18:13.542]  You know, leave our children alone.
[00:18:13.542 --> 00:18:14.943]  It's real simple.
[00:18:14.943 --> 00:18:16.965]  And now they want to attack our free speech.
[00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:23.229]  I mean, it's just like they came out after they clearly staged that shooting in Aurora and now got a drugged out, you know, Patsy up there.
[00:18:24.488 --> 00:18:24.909]  I don't know.
[00:18:40.748 --> 00:18:44.190]  And they go on to say that American people have turned against gun control.
[00:18:44.190 --> 00:19:03.141]  No, we've turned against tyrant control freaks taking our tax money, arming to the teeth against us, trying to train the military and police against us so offshore banks can rob this country.
[00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:04.822]  And so this is what's happening.
[00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:08.904]  They are trying to shut it down and instead it's making record profits.
[00:19:10.254 --> 00:19:12.679]  Record profits selling out of its food.
[00:19:12.679 --> 00:19:14.622]  Can't even supply enough of it.
[00:19:15.802 --> 00:19:18.284]  Because people are sick of it.
[00:19:18.284 --> 00:19:29.131]  They are tired of people that had parents that repressed them or whatever, who then become extreme, quote, liberals, and who just want to do a bunch of weird stuff to themselves.
[00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:35.156]  I mean, now sexual deviancy is getting to the point of people having arms and legs cut off because they think it's sexy.
[00:19:35.156 --> 00:19:37.778]  Okay, if you want to go chop your arms and legs off, do it.
[00:19:37.778 --> 00:19:40.580]  Just don't tell me about how great it is all day, okay?
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:40.940]  I mean, look.
[00:19:42.028 --> 00:19:46.092]  The point is, this is what happens in decadent societies right before societal collapse.
[00:19:46.092 --> 00:19:47.433]  It happens in every culture.
[00:19:47.433 --> 00:19:48.874]  People recognize that.
[00:19:48.874 --> 00:19:50.556]  And there's a rebellion against it.
[00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:51.457]  So, good!
[00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:52.938]  Get more radical.
[00:19:52.938 --> 00:19:53.759]  Push more stuff.
[00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.480]  Try to shut our businesses down.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.442]  Let's get it all out in the open.
[00:19:57.442 --> 00:20:00.485]  Alright, big economic and geopolitical news straight ahead.
[00:20:00.485 --> 00:20:05.249]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:20:05.249 --> 00:20:07.351]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:20:08.261 --> 00:20:17.224]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[00:21:03.139 --> 00:21:04.260]  Can't happen to you?
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.761]  Well, think again.
[00:21:05.761 --> 00:21:10.184]  Millions of honest, hard-working Americans have had their homes stolen by the banks.
[00:21:10.184 --> 00:21:11.565]  There is an answer.
[00:21:11.565 --> 00:21:14.568]  The answer is MortgageEndgame.com.

[00:22:30.084 --> 00:22:34.647]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:34.647 --> 00:22:40.471]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:40.471 --> 00:22:44.093]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:07.083]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.083 --> 00:24:09.324]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:24.685 --> 00:24:27.448]  We're good to go.
[00:24:47.245 --> 00:24:49.567]  All right, my friends, we are back live.
[00:24:49.567 --> 00:24:51.448]  Let me run through some of the news here.
[00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:56.192]  I already mentioned Chick-fil-A sets a world record.
[00:24:56.192 --> 00:24:59.755]  It's being reported by the Associated Press, the Weekly Standard, you name it.
[00:24:59.755 --> 00:25:02.437]  Selling out of chicken nationwide.
[00:25:02.437 --> 00:25:08.902]  So you get some mafia bully over Chicago going, we're going to shut you down.
[00:25:08.902 --> 00:25:10.724]  And everybody goes and buys their chicken up.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.641]  I mean, think about that.
[00:25:14.641 --> 00:25:26.808]  Somebody can't have their view that two men or two women shouldn't be able to get married and then have all the, you know, state conventions that are involved in it.
[00:25:26.808 --> 00:25:37.855]  I mean, regardless of which side of that debate you're on, you've got to agree you shouldn't shut down someone's business because the political commissars in a city or a town don't like what you're doing.
[00:25:37.855 --> 00:25:40.617]  That is the essence of oppression.
[00:25:41.465 --> 00:25:43.967]  And I meant to get to other news.
[00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:51.171]  It is so heartening to see the fact that people don't buy any of this anymore.
[00:25:51.171 --> 00:26:03.539]  Again, even if you were someone who had a non-conventional sexual orientation, do you really want to shut down businesses all over the U.S.
[00:26:03.539 --> 00:26:06.181]  because the company owner disagrees with you?
[00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:10.535]  And people defend this.
[00:26:10.535 --> 00:26:14.077]  This is what this liberal tyranny is all about.
[00:26:14.077 --> 00:26:17.439]  It's not liberal at all.
[00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:19.099]  It's about picking winners and losers.
[00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:31.987]  You take right here in Austin, Texas, if you don't go before the city council, and if you're not one of their little insider buddies that gives them campaign donations and hires their family members, you're not going to build anything in this town anymore.
[00:26:33.134 --> 00:26:35.955]  The code inspectors are out of control.
[00:26:35.955 --> 00:26:39.416]  They'll come to somebody and say, well, you've got a tree on your property.
[00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:40.476]  You can't build anything here.
[00:26:40.476 --> 00:26:43.457]  Do you have permission to cut a tree now?
[00:26:43.457 --> 00:26:49.558]  But then if their buddies want to build a golf course and cut down 10,000 trees, hey, knock it out.
[00:26:49.558 --> 00:26:51.419]  Cut down giant oak trees.
[00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:52.919]  Do whatever you want.
[00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:56.580]  Again, it's about selective enforcement in our society.
[00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:03.174]  Speaking of the nanny state, I have a stack of articles here.
[00:27:03.174 --> 00:27:05.197]  Are they going to ban knives?
[00:27:05.197 --> 00:27:09.261]  Xbox chat leads to a violent attack in Oakley.
[00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:19.679]  CBS 13, an online fight led to an in-person attack for a young man in Oakley, and he ended up with nearly two dozen stab wounds.
[00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:20.720]  Well, gotta ban knives.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.522]  It's not the fault of the guy that stabbed him.
[00:27:22.522 --> 00:27:24.583]  Here's one out of China Associated Press.
[00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:27.867]  Teenager kills eight, wounds five in China knife attack.
[00:27:27.867 --> 00:27:31.410]  His girlfriend broke up with him, so he went and stabbed everybody.
[00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.373]  Well, the answer is the Second Amendment did that over here in America.
[00:27:34.813 --> 00:27:41.098]  I mean, the Second Amendment caused Mexico to have problems when the government shipped the guns in and blamed the Second Amendment.
[00:27:41.098 --> 00:27:42.780]  Of course, Al-Qaeda, too, is a big problem.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.502]  That's why our criminal government's putting them into Libya and Syria.
[00:27:45.502 --> 00:27:48.544]  And that's all over the news, too, but it's not a big news issue.
[00:27:48.544 --> 00:27:49.865]  Oh, Al-Qaeda works for our government.
[00:27:49.865 --> 00:27:50.386]  Oh, yeah, but...
[00:27:51.581 --> 00:27:54.483]  That Alex Jones is bad for saying they did on 9-11.
[00:27:54.483 --> 00:28:04.089]  A teenager killed eight people with a knife and wounded five more in northeast China after falling out with his girlfriend, state media said Thursday.
[00:28:04.089 --> 00:28:12.053]  The teen killed two of her family members and six more people before fleeing, the state-run Legal Daily newspaper said.
[00:28:12.053 --> 00:28:16.156]  It reported he was caught but did not describe the circumstances.
[00:28:17.349 --> 00:28:27.554]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen, 17-year-old kills eight, wounds five, and you know whose fault that is, George Washington.
[00:28:27.554 --> 00:28:32.997]  They got a new ABC News show coming out called Founding Fathers that demonizes gun owners and Texans.
[00:28:32.997 --> 00:28:34.157]  I mean, absolutely.
[00:28:34.157 --> 00:28:45.723]  I mean, look, if somebody slips on a banana peel in South Africa, or Israel, or Germany, or Russia, you know who did it, George Washington.
[00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:46.664]  If you get a cold,
[00:28:47.503 --> 00:28:48.183]  You know who did it?
[00:28:48.183 --> 00:28:50.044]  Conservatives.
[00:28:50.044 --> 00:28:51.505]  Libertarians.
[00:28:51.505 --> 00:28:53.045]  All our fault.
[00:28:53.045 --> 00:28:55.266]  The number one terror threat is returning veterans.
[00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:58.147]  They're so evil.
[00:28:58.147 --> 00:28:58.667]  Oh, look at this.
[00:28:58.667 --> 00:29:00.048]  Washington Post.
[00:29:00.048 --> 00:29:05.630]  Two planes taking off from National put on collision course with plane trying to land.
[00:29:07.159 --> 00:29:09.782]  Three commuter jets came within seconds of mid-air collision.
[00:29:09.782 --> 00:29:12.985]  Of course, in the last few months, drones have almost crashed a couple times.
[00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:19.932]  But, of course, the answer is going to be make everything be robotically controlled by a central system, which globalists control, of course.
[00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:22.915]  And let all the cars be robotically run, and that will end all these problems.
[00:29:22.915 --> 00:29:25.217]  That's where the technocracy is going with all of this.
[00:29:25.217 --> 00:29:26.538]  I thought I would just... Oh, look!
[00:29:26.538 --> 00:29:29.501]  Missile defense staff warned to stop serving porn sites.
[00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:29.862]  Bloomberg!
[00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:34.851]  They can't even control themselves if they want to run our lives.
[00:29:34.851 --> 00:29:45.297]  Pelosi says, and Dems push Homeland Security for clarity on lesbian, gay, transgender people.
[00:29:45.297 --> 00:29:49.680]  So they're to get special rights and not be deported.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.061]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.061 --> 00:29:53.602]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.602 --> 00:29:56.284]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.072 --> 00:31:03.555]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[00:31:03.555 --> 00:31:09.499]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:31:09.499 --> 00:31:16.085]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:31:16.085 --> 00:31:21.789]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:25.432]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:31:25.612 --> 00:31:29.396]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[00:31:29.396 --> 00:31:34.021]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[00:31:34.021 --> 00:31:36.503]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[00:31:36.503 --> 00:31:40.367]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[00:31:40.367 --> 00:31:43.230]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[00:31:44.792 --> 00:31:47.736]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:31:47.736 --> 00:31:54.586]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:31:54.586 --> 00:31:58.832]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com
[00:31:59.913 --> 00:32:05.414]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:32:05.414 --> 00:32:07.815]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:32:07.815 --> 00:32:16.917]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:32:16.917 --> 00:32:20.357]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:32:20.357 --> 00:32:22.038]  There's no priming required.
[00:32:22.038 --> 00:32:24.318]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:32:24.318 --> 00:32:26.819]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:29.420]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.841]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:32:30.841 --> 00:32:34.003]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:32:34.003 --> 00:32:37.385]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:32:37.385 --> 00:32:41.527]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:32:41.527 --> 00:32:44.269]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:45.830]  It's what my family uses.
[00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.152]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[00:32:54.975 --> 00:32:56.296]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:32:56.296 --> 00:32:57.557]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:32:57.557 --> 00:33:00.419]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:40.532 --> 00:33:41.953]  Thanks for watching!
[00:34:04.671 --> 00:34:10.172]  It's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[00:34:10.172 --> 00:34:13.013]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[00:34:13.013 --> 00:34:16.634]  I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[00:34:16.634 --> 00:34:18.374]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[00:34:18.374 --> 00:34:20.635]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[00:34:20.635 --> 00:34:25.056]  Those that control my life and those that seek to control even more!
[00:34:25.056 --> 00:34:26.076]  I want freedom!
[00:34:26.076 --> 00:34:28.357]  That's what I want and that's what you should want!
[00:34:28.977 --> 00:34:37.323]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn loose just some of the greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities, because that is the central mode of control.
[00:34:37.323 --> 00:34:44.549]  Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:49.072]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[00:34:49.072 --> 00:34:51.874]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[00:34:51.874 --> 00:34:53.836]  The 21st century is going to be a new century.
[00:34:54.196 --> 00:35:03.482]  Not the century of slavery, not the century of lies, and even those of indifference, and classism, and statism, and all the rest of the modes of control.
[00:35:03.482 --> 00:35:08.465]  It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.
[00:35:08.465 --> 00:35:12.527]  What a bunch of garbage, liberal, democrat, conservative, republican.
[00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:15.669]  It's all there to control you, two sides of the same coin.
[00:35:15.669 --> 00:35:21.373]  Two management teams bidding for control, the CEO job of Slavery Incorporated.
[00:35:21.373 --> 00:35:23.734]  The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out
[00:35:23.834 --> 00:35:25.334]  This buffet of lies!
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.335]  I'm sick of it!
[00:35:26.335 --> 00:35:30.155]  And I'm not going to take a bite out of it!
[00:35:30.155 --> 00:35:32.176]  Do you got me?
[00:35:32.176 --> 00:35:33.836]  Human kind is too good!
[00:35:33.836 --> 00:35:35.837]  We're not a bunch of underachievers!
[00:35:35.837 --> 00:35:38.517]  We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings!
[00:35:38.517 --> 00:35:40.878]  We're going to defend the real things!
[00:35:40.878 --> 00:35:42.298]  The things that matter!
[00:35:42.298 --> 00:35:43.038]  Creativity!
[00:35:43.038 --> 00:35:47.239]  And the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[00:35:47.239 --> 00:35:47.819]  Well that's it!
[00:35:47.819 --> 00:35:48.960]  That's all I got to say!
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.720]  Continue your court!
[00:35:54.255 --> 00:35:59.479]  Again, I was just psychoanalyzing my own self why I'm so freaked out.
[00:35:59.479 --> 00:36:04.624]  And maybe it's because the Ayatollah that runs Iran, you know, Ahmadinejad's a puppet.
[00:36:04.624 --> 00:36:06.465]  They allow you to run over there and allow you to win.
[00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:09.888]  Kind of like our system.
[00:36:09.888 --> 00:36:12.270]  They said they're prepared for war in the next two weeks.
[00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:17.814]  The former head of the Mossad that quit about two years ago saying an attack on Iran is a very bad idea.
[00:36:17.814 --> 00:36:20.356]  He came out and told Iran, prepare to be attacked.
[00:36:20.356 --> 00:36:21.898]  Warning in the next 12 weeks.
[00:36:24.338 --> 00:36:29.361]  Which generally would be treason.
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:30.862]  I mean, if a U.S.
[00:36:30.862 --> 00:36:48.952]  former head of the CIA told the government, get ready to be hit in the next 12 weeks, even though that's a moral thing to do because the war is wrong and will destabilize things, it's a big deal to have someone come out and say, don't do that.
[00:36:48.952 --> 00:36:52.354]  We've had a bunch of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[00:36:54.192 --> 00:37:02.959]  We've had a bunch of them going back, what, six years or so, seven years, refused to attack Iran.
[00:37:02.959 --> 00:37:05.020]  And Yahoo's saying time's running out.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:16.088]  What's happening is the bankers are imploding the world economy right now, and they want a big political diversion to blame it all on, and to blame exploding oil prices and all the rest of it on.
[00:37:16.088 --> 00:37:17.389]  And that's the game plan.
[00:37:17.389 --> 00:37:20.592]  And the whole world is lining up for this
[00:37:22.185 --> 00:37:38.599]  Huge intensification of crises and the ships are massing and they've done this a lot over the last six, seven years, but now it's the most intense it's ever been.
[00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:49.848]  And then you add to that, they have not had the military ready for martial law and running checkpoints everywhere and openly admitting that they're gearing up for it and getting ready for it all over the place.
[00:37:54.998 --> 00:37:59.863]  I'm not saying we're going to have martial law in October as an October surprise with an attack on Iran.
[00:37:59.863 --> 00:38:02.826]  But all the evidence points in that direction.
[00:38:02.826 --> 00:38:03.947]  Can it be turned around?
[00:38:03.947 --> 00:38:04.828]  Maybe.
[00:38:04.828 --> 00:38:14.618]  And then I'm here on the air talking about people rebelling against political correctness and attacks on free speech by Chick-fil-A support.
[00:38:16.826 --> 00:38:22.109]  Congressman says we're still home of the brave, but we're not the land of the free anymore.
[00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.369]  Really?
[00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:28.293]  Are we still the land of the brave to morally admit that we have criminals that have hijacked our country?
[00:38:28.293 --> 00:38:30.174]  Yeah, there's a lot of brave people left in this country.
[00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:31.955]  There's a lot of brave people everywhere.
[00:38:31.955 --> 00:38:35.338]  But there's also a lot of people living in delusion.
[00:38:35.338 --> 00:38:37.099]  A group of freshman congressmen
[00:38:38.038 --> 00:38:47.570]  came out yesterday and said that a regulation issued under Obamacare and Health Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has taken freedom of religion away from Americans.
[00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.612]  Yeah, it has.
[00:38:49.612 --> 00:38:52.916]  You gotta fund abortion, you gotta hire people that aren't of your religion.
[00:38:52.916 --> 00:38:55.700]  Basically, it's killing free association.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.562]  And that's always been their plan.
[00:39:06.926 --> 00:39:18.393]  That's just some of the information that we have here in front of us today.
[00:39:18.393 --> 00:39:21.015]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:39:21.015 --> 00:39:23.676]  Look at this financial news.
[00:39:23.676 --> 00:39:27.338]  Fed holds off on new steps to stimulate U.S.
[00:39:27.338 --> 00:39:27.759]  economy.
[00:39:27.759 --> 00:39:34.683]  They have held back over a year with QE3, and you're in trouble if you do, you're in trouble if you don't.
[00:39:36.115 --> 00:39:39.076]  If they don't, the depression will accelerate.
[00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:46.397]  Most of my dad's patients that had good jobs five years ago have two low-paid jobs now.
[00:39:46.397 --> 00:39:50.578]  Everybody I talk to, you know Austin is per capita the wealthiest city in the country now.
[00:39:50.578 --> 00:39:55.459]  The best place to be, about half the restaurants I would go to in the past are closed.
[00:39:55.459 --> 00:40:00.861]  You go to stores, they've got about a third the people in them they had before.
[00:40:00.861 --> 00:40:02.041]  People are freaked out.
[00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.471]  And they tell us in the media, oh, the economy's great.
[00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:14.392]  Oh, but we never really got out of the recession three and a half years ago.
[00:40:14.392 --> 00:40:16.512]  Well, that's called a depression.
[00:40:16.512 --> 00:40:24.274]  And then meanwhile, you have these mega banks that are publicly above the law doing anything they want, tax exempt.
[00:40:24.274 --> 00:40:29.136]  And I was reading where the gold medals are, what, 1.5 percent gold, or was it 1.8?
[00:40:30.925 --> 00:40:31.146]  1.87.
[00:40:31.146 --> 00:40:33.611]  They're 1.87.
[00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:34.673]  Good job, CJ, knowing that.
[00:40:34.673 --> 00:40:36.276]  I saw the article yesterday.
[00:40:36.276 --> 00:40:40.104]  And the IRS is there to charge them.
[00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:40.806]  It's a gift.
[00:40:40.806 --> 00:40:41.627]  You're not supposed to even...
[00:40:42.861 --> 00:40:53.773]  They're setting a precedent where if somebody gives you a toy, you're supposed to pay taxes when you're a kid or if somebody gives you, I mean, they're going after swap meets and garage sales and lemonade stands.
[00:40:53.773 --> 00:41:03.725]  This is the new economy where any barter or underground, bake sales, whatever, the IRS is showing up and county and city people are showing up.
[00:41:03.905 --> 00:41:11.368]  They're not watching the mayor who's busy doing insider deals and making millions ripping people off, you know, in your town, in many cases.
[00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:16.471]  They're not busy watching the mass criminality or the UN kidnapping kids inside the U.S.
[00:41:16.471 --> 00:41:23.394]  in our diplomatic community and flying them to different countries and even comes out in the news and nobody gets in trouble.
[00:41:23.394 --> 00:41:25.315]  They're not worried about any of that.
[00:41:25.315 --> 00:41:31.958]  They're there saying we want, out of the tiny bit of gold, we want a couple hundred dollars out of those fake gold medals.
[00:41:34.465 --> 00:41:40.770]  And I just thought that just absolutely illustrates how the mega banks and these globalists are all tax-exempt.
[00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:44.332]  And what a joke it is, though, that they've got the tax enforcers.
[00:41:44.332 --> 00:41:47.154]  When they win a gold medal, they get a $10,000 per diem.
[00:41:47.154 --> 00:41:48.495]  They grab part of that.
[00:41:48.495 --> 00:41:51.357]  They grab part of their gold medal.
[00:41:51.357 --> 00:41:55.661]  Or they threaten to seize them if you don't immediately pay them.
[00:41:55.661 --> 00:42:02.826]  And the idea is you don't even get to pay, at the end of the year, the private Federal Reserve to their collection agency, the IRS.
[00:42:03.823 --> 00:42:07.845]  My dad was talking to a high-level IRS agent who's a whistleblower.
[00:42:07.845 --> 00:42:10.387]  Well, he's beginning to become a whistleblower.
[00:42:10.387 --> 00:42:11.187]  He's been there a while.
[00:42:11.187 --> 00:42:12.028]  We'll just leave it at that.
[00:42:12.028 --> 00:42:18.692]  He said, yeah, guess who we're raising 70% of our money off of now?
[00:42:18.692 --> 00:42:25.676]  And my dad met with him yesterday, and he's like, guess.
[00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:29.879]  70% of it, roughly, is coming from retirees because they've changed the regulations.
[00:42:31.195 --> 00:42:41.612]  Where now when you take money out of your 401k or whatever, they're taking retirees' houses and the guy says he can't do it anymore even though he's been there 20 plus years.
[00:42:41.612 --> 00:42:43.535]  He's a senior and he's gonna have to quit.
[00:42:44.634 --> 00:42:46.715]  Well, yeah.
[00:42:46.715 --> 00:42:51.718]  And he gives my dad all these documents and stuff, and a lot of it's not even secret or restricted.
[00:42:51.718 --> 00:42:53.079]  In fact, none of it is.
[00:42:53.079 --> 00:43:00.823]  It's stuff like the Grace Commission, but an original copy of it they have at the IRS, where all the money goes to offshore banks, none of it to run the country.
[00:43:00.823 --> 00:43:07.726]  And he was saying the IRS all over, because the biggest IRS office in the country is based here in Austin, Texas.
[00:43:07.726 --> 00:43:09.727]  Big, giant complexes all over the place.
[00:43:09.727 --> 00:43:11.088]  I think it's a five-state area.
[00:43:12.844 --> 00:43:21.986]  That everybody else has horrible morale because they realize they're only allowed to go after middle class or poor people and retirees.
[00:43:21.986 --> 00:43:26.667]  And he said they're taking retirees houses by the thousands a week.
[00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:31.808]  They come through just in the five state area where they're taking the houses.
[00:43:31.808 --> 00:43:33.749]  I mean, they're throwing retirees out of their houses.
[00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:39.482]  And this fella is basically retiree age, and they're understanding.
[00:43:39.482 --> 00:43:42.184]  Because you know who's coming across their desk?
[00:43:42.184 --> 00:43:45.708]  Retired government people are having their houses taken too.
[00:43:45.708 --> 00:43:47.950]  Oh yeah, you're gonna have everything taken.
[00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.392]  Let me just give that little message.
[00:43:50.392 --> 00:43:56.077]  In fact, they just threw an article about poverty increasing among retirees.
[00:44:00.609 --> 00:44:06.031]  Meanwhile, gas prices post rare steep rise in July ahead of war.
[00:44:06.031 --> 00:44:09.452]  Latest market glitch shows trading out of control.
[00:44:09.452 --> 00:44:12.533]  CNBC, it's not out of control, it's in control.
[00:44:12.533 --> 00:44:18.595]  It's the glitches when Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan come in and steal billions at a time.
[00:44:18.595 --> 00:44:22.857]  They're allowed to have their computers hooked right into the computers in front of everybody, because they run the government.
[00:44:24.281 --> 00:44:27.024]  And they know when they're going to drop it and bring it right back up.
[00:44:27.024 --> 00:44:29.046]  It's these flip trades they do.
[00:44:29.046 --> 00:44:32.930]  And there's different permutations of it.
[00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:36.054]  Again, it's just madmen running everything.
[00:44:36.054 --> 00:44:40.278]  Flood of errant trades is a black eye for Wall Street.
[00:44:40.278 --> 00:44:41.039]  New York Times.
[00:44:41.039 --> 00:44:43.602]  Oh, a black eye!
[00:44:43.602 --> 00:44:45.244]  Jobless claims increased.
[00:44:45.244 --> 00:44:46.105]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:44:48.274 --> 00:44:56.458]  Hyper Mario and Germany on the verge of all-out warfare over the fact that they want to basically hyperinflate in Italy, but Germany doesn't want to.
[00:44:56.458 --> 00:44:58.279]  Stunning crimes of the big banks.
[00:44:58.279 --> 00:45:00.321]  Worse than your wildest imaginations.
[00:45:00.321 --> 00:45:02.502]  Washington blog breaks these down.
[00:45:02.502 --> 00:45:04.263]  I wish I had time to go over this.
[00:45:04.263 --> 00:45:12.747]  And then I have the articles, again, where the IRS is waiting, demanding money on the spot.
[00:45:12.747 --> 00:45:15.409]  It's like a grandstanding.
[00:45:15.409 --> 00:45:16.669]  As if they can even do that.
[00:45:16.669 --> 00:45:17.650]  But that's the idea.
[00:45:18.683 --> 00:45:30.154]  That's why they passed a law last year in Louisiana, where you can't pay cash for things if they're secondhand.
[00:45:30.154 --> 00:45:31.755]  I mean, that's like a prison.
[00:45:31.755 --> 00:45:38.201]  You gotta buy your stuff from the company store, grapes or wrath, or we're gonna throw you out on the highway.
[00:45:38.201 --> 00:45:42.686]  I mean, all the old forms of bondage, everything horrible is coming back.
[00:45:43.893 --> 00:45:47.795]  And listen, it's by design, and that's why I'm just so freaked out.
[00:45:47.795 --> 00:45:51.756]  In my gut, I have never been this concerned.
[00:45:51.756 --> 00:45:59.160]  Because once they start the war with Iran and Syria and probably Russia, once they drop the hammer, they're going to blow up stuff all over the country.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:06.383]  They've got the police all ready to play the part of heroes, and they're going to say that the domestic groups are working with foreign governments.
[00:46:06.383 --> 00:46:08.343]  It won't matter how ridiculous it is.
[00:46:08.343 --> 00:46:11.425]  It won't matter if you point out that the Pentagon runs al-Qaeda publicly.
[00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:19.155]  A lot of people are just going to get in line, and they're going to march the police and military after the American people.
[00:46:19.155 --> 00:46:20.416]  I mean, they're gangsters, folks.
[00:46:20.416 --> 00:46:25.640]  They say, we're going to shut down your business if your owner doesn't like same-sex marriage.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.382]  I mean, these are gangsters.
[00:46:28.382 --> 00:46:33.926]  Mayor Bloomberg says he's going to tell you what you're going to eat.
[00:46:33.926 --> 00:46:38.369]  Obama has put in government health care, and his buddies are all exempt from having to do it.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:47.446]  I mean, it's all so over the top.
[00:46:47.446 --> 00:46:49.808]  And it's these crazy, arrogant people.
[00:46:49.808 --> 00:46:58.715]  It's like when I caught city people stealing and trying to destroy AXS TV eight, nine years ago.
[00:46:58.715 --> 00:47:02.398]  I wasn't even really on AXS TV anymore, but we still put our tapes in there.
[00:47:02.398 --> 00:47:05.260]  And I went in, I could tell while they were shutting down, I could tell how they were acting.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.262]  And I said, yeah, I have proof you're stealing money.
[00:47:08.407 --> 00:47:10.988]  And they all freaked out and said, no, you better not release that proof.
[00:47:10.988 --> 00:47:15.489]  And I kind of, you know, used a cop trick on them to get them to admit they'd done it.
[00:47:15.489 --> 00:47:17.570]  And then, of course, I recorded that.
[00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:21.872]  And I went and the city and the police wouldn't do anything because it went to the top of the city.
[00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:30.855]  And they were going to pay them all off to let them shut down access television just to get me off the air, even though I wasn't even on the air there anymore.
[00:47:30.855 --> 00:47:35.696]  And it was in the news and they sent one guy to prison, the director.
[00:47:35.696 --> 00:47:37.797]  But he was just the patsy and he was out in a couple of years.
[00:47:42.168 --> 00:47:43.789]  And it's just like that everywhere.
[00:47:43.789 --> 00:47:46.352]  These people don't know how to make things.
[00:47:46.352 --> 00:47:47.532]  They don't know how to create things.
[00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:49.754]  They just don't know how to steal stuff.
[00:47:49.754 --> 00:47:54.959]  And again, they don't care that if they rob everybody up front, then no one will produce.
[00:47:54.959 --> 00:47:55.479]  They don't care.
[00:47:55.479 --> 00:48:05.728]  They'd rather snatch everything, let society collapse, live in an armored neighborhood with police guarding them, and then everything goes to hell in a handbasket, instead of the American system
[00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:20.420]  Of all people are empowered and freedom and rugged individualism that produces such incredible wealth and all that's going out the window.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:27.365]  And I think about how the globalists have got all this worked out.
[00:48:28.729 --> 00:48:33.994]  And it's so transparent if you're informed, but you gotta realize the general public is not informed.
[00:48:33.994 --> 00:48:37.196]  They know not to trust the government now, and they know they're being lied to.
[00:48:37.196 --> 00:48:41.860]  But they don't really have an idea just how bad it is.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:51.488]  Or they just feel desperate and disempowered, and they're like, well, what can I do to this system?
[00:48:51.488 --> 00:48:52.089]  What can I do?
[00:48:53.595 --> 00:48:55.537]  You know, families are having problems.
[00:48:55.537 --> 00:48:56.999]  Individuals are having problems.
[00:48:56.999 --> 00:49:01.023]  There's record numbers of suicides in the country, but also worldwide.
[00:49:01.023 --> 00:49:04.607]  And it's because deep down we know it's a failed system.
[00:49:04.607 --> 00:49:08.512]  And deep down, just like birds know two days before, a hurricane's coming.
[00:49:09.465 --> 00:49:11.527]  I mean, they had a big study just came out a month ago.
[00:49:11.527 --> 00:49:18.733]  Guys, will you reprint that about science proves magnetic sensors in birds and fish?
[00:49:18.733 --> 00:49:19.814]  Of course, humans have them too.
[00:49:19.814 --> 00:49:22.196]  That's what the cell phones and stuff are doing to us.
[00:49:22.196 --> 00:49:26.560]  All of this electromagnetic stuff is screwing us up.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.262]  But again, we have those instincts.
[00:49:28.262 --> 00:49:29.182]  We have that discernment.
[00:49:29.182 --> 00:49:30.383]  We have incredible
[00:49:31.625 --> 00:49:34.307]  Systems built into us by the Creator.
[00:49:34.307 --> 00:49:39.329]  And everyone, if you don't intellectually know, we're in deep trouble.
[00:49:39.329 --> 00:49:41.410]  You deep down know it.
[00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:51.256]  And so men's wives get desperate, this happens in every culture, and get upset and get angry at their men, thinking that you can fix it if I just get on you.
[00:49:51.256 --> 00:49:57.519]  Well that might work if your husband didn't get up 10,000 years ago and go out and kill a deer and bring it back because your kids were hungry.
[00:50:00.708 --> 00:50:01.768]  That might have worked then.
[00:50:01.768 --> 00:50:03.149]  That's the woman's instinct.
[00:50:03.149 --> 00:50:04.469]  That doesn't work now.
[00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:09.331]  We're in an artificial system.
[00:50:09.331 --> 00:50:20.434]  And it's designed by people who are inbred, so they're highly aggressive, highly dominant, but inbred, so they got a twist of insanity.
[00:50:20.434 --> 00:50:28.877]  And so many of the current policies we live under were developed during major, pretty much across the board,
[00:50:30.017 --> 00:50:30.117]  I'm
[00:50:45.816 --> 00:50:49.539]  Which overlays the good that was in humanity, so there's two tracks.
[00:50:49.539 --> 00:50:58.345]  There's an overlay of just inbred syphilitic, you know, mad hatter, toxified craziness.
[00:50:58.345 --> 00:50:59.626]  More news straight ahead.
[00:50:59.626 --> 00:51:00.507]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.507 --> 00:51:07.031]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:51:07.031 --> 00:51:09.613]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:51:09.613 --> 00:51:14.657]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:51:14.997 --> 00:51:19.962]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:51:19.962 --> 00:51:27.609]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:51:27.609 --> 00:51:31.472]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:51:31.472 --> 00:51:33.274]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:51:33.274 --> 00:51:37.297]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.

[00:55:09.534 --> 00:55:10.915]  Things have gotten out of control.
[00:55:10.915 --> 00:55:25.784]  And it won't be like crises we've seen past civilizations because the weaponry is so powerful.
[00:55:25.784 --> 00:55:30.087]  And the individuals that are in control of things claim they want a world government.
[00:55:31.772 --> 00:55:34.894]  To end all these wars, but that's not really what's happening.
[00:55:34.894 --> 00:55:37.736]  They want to end individual freedom.
[00:55:37.736 --> 00:55:39.978]  They want to end sovereignty.
[00:55:39.978 --> 00:55:44.281]  They want to end choices.
[00:55:44.281 --> 00:55:53.989]  And if the UN ever gets in control, if the globalists ever get in full control, which they're close to doing, they have stated that they will kill the majority of us.
[00:55:53.989 --> 00:55:58.332]  And I know that's an incredible statement, but I mean, they've said it literally thousands of times.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.620]  Does it matter?
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:13.768]  UN Biological Diversity Assessments, State Department Memorandum 200, Ted Turner, Prince Charles, Prince Philip, that's their religion.
[00:56:13.768 --> 00:56:18.211]  And how do you get a sitcom drama TV watching public?
[00:56:19.218 --> 00:56:21.681]  To even imagine what they're facing.
[00:56:21.681 --> 00:56:32.476]  Even as they're being soft-killed by cancer implanted in vaccines decades before, they still just go off and are killed by the medical system and have no idea that it was done to them, in most cases.
[00:56:33.482 --> 00:56:34.823]  It's like fluoride.
[00:56:34.823 --> 00:56:39.505]  Seven-fold increase in men and boys, three-fold increase in women.
[00:56:39.505 --> 00:56:47.430]  New Harvard study looked at over 12 studies from 76 to 2011 and said, yeah, it brain damages you, it gives you cancer.
[00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:50.391]  And look, I know I said this yesterday and I said it the day before.
[00:56:50.391 --> 00:56:51.672]  It's a big deal, okay?
[00:56:51.672 --> 00:56:55.054]  I mean, the people running things knew that in the 20s, folks.
[00:56:55.054 --> 00:56:56.815]  There have been thousands of these studies.
[00:56:57.395 --> 00:57:01.337]  I always say hundreds, because I think, oh, that sounds too big.
[00:57:01.337 --> 00:57:17.804]  I'll lie and say less, because I don't want it to sound... The only time I lie, folks, and I catch myself doing this, it's involuntary, is when I know the real number, and people won't believe it, so I downgrade it.
[00:57:17.804 --> 00:57:18.924]  That's what I do.
[00:57:18.924 --> 00:57:21.085]  I generally don't exaggerate.
[00:57:21.085 --> 00:57:22.526]  And there's not much hyperbole here.
[00:57:23.336 --> 00:57:42.426]  Remember Aaron Dykes one time said, I heard you like 10 years ago, when I was going to UT, say that Madeline Albright could squat, you know, leg press 600 pounds, and I thought it was a joke, and then I was watching a news show the other day and they showed her doing it.
[00:57:42.426 --> 00:57:46.288]  Yeah, no, that was in the, she was bragging about it, I don't know if it's true or not.
[00:57:46.288 --> 00:57:52.471]  I mean, the point is, reality is so much crazier than anything I can describe to you.
[00:57:53.901 --> 00:57:59.406]  And so I'm just here, like you are, going, what do we do?
[00:57:59.406 --> 00:58:00.888]  I don't want a civil war.
[00:58:00.888 --> 00:58:03.170]  I don't want World War III.
[00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:12.558]  I don't like the bankers being tax exempt while they're taking retirees' houses after changing laws retroactively to rob them.
[00:58:12.558 --> 00:58:14.399]  Makes me angry.
[00:58:14.399 --> 00:58:15.581]  Makes me sick in my stomach.
[00:58:21.147 --> 00:58:22.828]  I don't even know what to say anymore at this point.
[00:58:22.828 --> 00:58:26.629]  We're just going to go to break, come back, and then we've got a big guest coming up.
[00:58:26.629 --> 00:58:32.472]  And I'm going to try to just sit back and let her go through the exhibits here on air.
[00:58:32.472 --> 00:58:35.033]  It's one thing to read these thousands of pages.
[00:58:35.033 --> 00:58:36.754]  It's another thing to try to uncover it on air.
[00:58:36.754 --> 00:58:37.754]  It's very frustrating.
[00:58:37.754 --> 00:58:47.078]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.421 --> 00:58:54.984]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.984 --> 00:58:55.884]  Number one.
[00:58:55.884 --> 00:58:59.307]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.307 --> 00:59:00.167]  Number two.
[00:59:00.167 --> 00:59:05.070]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:05.811]  It's true.
[00:59:05.811 --> 00:59:10.674]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.674 --> 00:59:11.514]  Number three.
[00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:15.097]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.097 --> 00:59:18.799]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.999 --> 00:59:19.800]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.562]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.562 --> 00:59:26.226]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.226 --> 00:59:27.027]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.027 --> 00:59:31.170]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:35.935]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.215 --> 00:59:40.377]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:00:09.976 --> 01:00:11.558]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.558 --> 01:00:13.120]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:17.304]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.304 --> 01:00:21.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:53.119]  All right, yeah, I know we're live here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:54.339]  Yes, I know we're live.
[01:00:54.339 --> 01:00:58.381]  Thank you for joining me today.
[01:00:58.381 --> 01:01:02.342]  We have a very special guest coming up during the next break.
[01:01:04.091 --> 01:01:10.176]  And we'll probably have her for like an hour and 20 minutes or so ahead of another guest that's going to be joining us.
[01:01:10.176 --> 01:01:16.580]  This stuff started coming in last week and I've been so busy I haven't had a lot of time to go back over it.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:23.485]  But she sent me these documents, I don't know, back in like 1998 or so.
[01:01:23.485 --> 01:01:28.389]  And back then I couldn't show people the documents like I can here with PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:44.422]  But she has all the education codes, she has all the police training manuals, she has all the news articles where they thought the American people were trusting after World War II and would do whatever they were told.
[01:01:44.422 --> 01:01:54.131]  So she's got New York Times, she's got LA Times, she's got everything, photocopies of it.
[01:01:55.954 --> 01:02:01.859]  Openly announcing the global government, the FEMA regions, the end of the family, UN troops in America.
[01:02:01.859 --> 01:02:06.222]  And this is why the old-timers knew all this was coming and people make fun of them.
[01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:17.931]  That was because before people rebelled against it in the 70s and 80s, they openly pushed all this.
[01:02:17.931 --> 01:02:20.573]  And I don't even know where to start when she comes on.
[01:02:22.779 --> 01:02:27.683]  I mean, they openly trained the San Diego Police Department on how to be communist.
[01:02:27.683 --> 01:02:29.585]  And this is like in the newspaper.
[01:02:29.585 --> 01:02:32.307]  I mean, wait till we go over all this.
[01:02:32.307 --> 01:02:48.781]  She's got all these news articles, all these documents, FEMA documents, 7277, and it is just so mind-blowing because it breaks down why we are facing all of this.
[01:02:50.305 --> 01:02:54.128]  Why things are so bad.
[01:02:54.128 --> 01:02:56.030]  Why things are so out of control.
[01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:58.452]  Because it's an exact plan.
[01:02:58.452 --> 01:03:05.357]  I've got criminal justice standards, goals, and recommendations for the National Advisory Commission for Criminal Justice Standards and Goals.
[01:03:05.357 --> 01:03:10.061]  How they destroyed the police and turned them into what they are now.
[01:03:10.061 --> 01:03:13.824]  How they're going to take all the guns, put troops in every city.
[01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:16.066]  This is all pre-Rand Corporation.
[01:03:16.066 --> 01:03:17.727]  This is Stanford Research Institute.
[01:03:23.385 --> 01:03:28.531]  Stanford Research Institute developed the Hurricane Control Weapons, certified 1967.
[01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:36.041]  I mean, it's all there.
[01:03:36.041 --> 01:03:37.542]  They have to write this stuff down.
[01:03:38.598 --> 01:03:44.439]  They have to write all this stuff down to be able to implement it, and they think we're dumb, so the plans are all right there.
[01:03:44.439 --> 01:03:46.379]  This is all a confession.
[01:03:46.379 --> 01:03:52.661]  How they're going to get rid of our troops, how they're going to bring in UN troops, how all our guns will be taken.
[01:03:52.661 --> 01:03:53.841]  It's all here.
[01:03:53.841 --> 01:03:58.162]  This is all Agenda 21 before they even called it Agenda 21.
[01:03:58.162 --> 01:04:00.462]  So we're going to let her lead.
[01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:05.363]  When we come in, I'm just going to try to give her the floor for the next hour and 20 minutes.
[01:04:09.093 --> 01:04:12.314]  She set up the Second Amendment Committee decades ago.
[01:04:12.314 --> 01:04:15.556]  Without people like her, we probably wouldn't even have a Second Amendment.
[01:04:15.556 --> 01:04:18.517]  And for the life of me, I don't even know why I haven't had her on in probably a decade.
[01:04:18.517 --> 01:04:19.297]  I don't remember how long.
[01:04:19.297 --> 01:04:20.598]  It's been close to a decade.
[01:04:20.598 --> 01:04:22.498]  We'll ask her when she gets on air with us.
[01:04:22.498 --> 01:04:27.400]  I just remembered her the other day, because commenters were going, why don't you get Bernadine Smith on?
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.901]  I'm like, yeah, I keep meaning to get her on.
[01:04:28.901 --> 01:04:31.242]  And you blink and 10 years goes by.
[01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.642]  You know how that is.
[01:04:32.642 --> 01:04:34.883]  We were watching old home movies last night over at my parents.
[01:04:34.883 --> 01:04:36.404]  I hadn't seen since I shot them.
[01:04:39.366 --> 01:04:41.007]  19 years ago.
[01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:42.869]  And it's in the same house my parents live in now.
[01:04:42.869 --> 01:04:47.992]  And I was sitting in the same chair I was sitting in, shooting video when I was watching it on TV.
[01:04:47.992 --> 01:04:50.633]  And everything was pretty much the same at my parents' house.
[01:04:50.633 --> 01:04:55.797]  Except now... 19 years have gone by, and I'm old.
[01:04:55.797 --> 01:04:57.138]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.138 --> 01:04:57.538]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.637 --> 01:05:10.764]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:05:10.764 --> 01:05:14.828]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:22.134]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.

[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:35.924]  Buy the 1 to 2 month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:35.924 --> 01:05:41.348]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[01:05:41.348 --> 01:05:43.329]  This is an amazing deal.
[01:05:43.329 --> 01:05:48.552]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[01:05:48.552 --> 01:05:50.734]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com
[01:05:51.594 --> 01:06:00.241]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[01:06:00.241 --> 01:06:06.405]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:06:06.405 --> 01:06:09.347]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:06:09.347 --> 01:06:14.751]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:06:14.751 --> 01:06:18.014]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.695]  Blowing up your food prices.
[01:06:19.695 --> 01:06:27.337]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[01:06:27.337 --> 01:06:31.198]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:06:31.198 --> 01:06:32.999]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:06:32.999 --> 01:06:37.020]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.621]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:06:39.921 --> 01:06:42.704]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[01:06:42.704 --> 01:06:47.268]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:06:47.268 --> 01:06:47.909]  Don't wait!
[01:06:47.909 --> 01:06:49.791]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:51.393]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[01:06:51.393 --> 01:06:52.894]  You can bet your life on efoods direct.
[01:07:00.061 --> 01:07:05.564]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:07:05.564 --> 01:07:07.966]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:07:07.966 --> 01:07:17.071]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:07:17.071 --> 01:07:20.513]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:07:20.513 --> 01:07:22.195]  There's no priming required.
[01:07:22.195 --> 01:07:24.476]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:07:24.476 --> 01:07:26.977]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:07:28.038 --> 01:07:29.558]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:07:29.558 --> 01:07:30.979]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:07:30.979 --> 01:07:34.140]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.521]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:41.662]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:07:41.662 --> 01:07:44.403]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:07:44.403 --> 01:07:45.983]  It's what my family uses.
[01:07:45.983 --> 01:07:49.284]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:07:49.284 --> 01:07:54.866]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[01:07:55.146 --> 01:07:57.829]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:07:57.829 --> 01:08:03.236]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.236 --> 01:08:06.580]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.501 --> 01:08:41.047]  Ladies and gentlemen, most radio shows will pick two or three topics to cover over two, three hours, and they will basically keep things at a very dumbed-down level.
[01:08:41.047 --> 01:08:43.268]  That is not what we do here on this broadcast.
[01:08:43.268 --> 01:08:55.934]  We are really trying to inform the public about the global six megabanks who have now announced that they have conquered the United States and Europe through derivatives fraud.
[01:08:57.256 --> 01:09:11.428]  And we are here pointing out that the new system of government they want to put us under is a synthesis of fascism and communism where they are exempt from laws and live in total luxury and we are slaves.
[01:09:11.428 --> 01:09:19.134]  Basically the model has been put into theatrical fiction form of the Hunger Games or Zardoz.
[01:09:19.134 --> 01:09:21.096]  It is a eugenics based system.
[01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:27.708]  Now, for the next hour and 20 minutes or so, we're going to have her until the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:27.708 --> 01:09:35.598]  We are joined by someone who hasn't been on with us for close to a decade, Bernadine Smith, the founder of the Second Amendment Committee.
[01:09:35.598 --> 01:09:39.183]  She is a political research writer and gun activist, gun rights activist,
[01:09:39.924 --> 01:09:53.334]  And she is the recipient of many different awards for patriotic achievements, and in 84 she formed the Second Amendment Committee, which is a nationwide organization that provides information of benefit to those seeking a peaceful resolution to the gun crisis.
[01:09:53.334 --> 01:10:05.743]  She is the only person to receive three awards from the American Pistol and Rifle Association, one of those awards for the authorship of the Hanford Pro-Gun Legislation, a measure which supports rights and states' rights in
[01:10:06.283 --> 01:10:06.583]  I don't know.
[01:10:22.143 --> 01:10:32.092]  I claim the Second Amendment Committee to be the number one gun defender in the nation, over and above the National Rifle Association and any other large pro-gun organization in the nation.
[01:10:32.092 --> 01:10:45.703]  Undoubtedly, Bernadine Smith with libertygunrights.com and the Second Amendment Committee, undoubtedly she has done groundbreaking research to understand the threat.
[01:10:45.703 --> 01:10:47.345]  Now, back in like 1998,
[01:10:49.471 --> 01:10:50.412]  She contacted me.
[01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:51.153]  She'd been a guest.
[01:10:51.153 --> 01:11:00.801]  She said, listen, I'm going to send you basically one-of-a-kind binders with all the proof from the government's own documents, public source, of the plan to end U.S.
[01:11:00.801 --> 01:11:02.162]  sovereignty, bring in U.N.
[01:11:02.162 --> 01:11:03.964]  troops, disarm us.
[01:11:03.964 --> 01:11:05.004]  Now, that's in the new U.N.
[01:11:05.004 --> 01:11:05.665]  treaty.
[01:11:05.665 --> 01:11:07.407]  It says Article 15, they'll send in
[01:11:08.087 --> 01:11:14.011]  Member states to disarm the other country that only governments can be armed but only enough for their internal security.
[01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:18.794]  And she's got all the documents, not just 7277, State Department memorandum, all of it.
[01:11:18.794 --> 01:11:25.879]  Now she sent me this time, because I loaned somebody one of these years ago and never got it back, she sent me all three of them at once.
[01:11:27.178 --> 01:11:29.239]  And one of these I hadn't had before.
[01:11:29.239 --> 01:11:31.540]  And they all tie together.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:43.446]  And again, it's just full of news articles in 1937, the New York Times calling for a global government and nine regions controlled inside the US and all this.
[01:11:44.451 --> 01:11:46.292]  Now we're under 10 regions.
[01:11:46.292 --> 01:11:50.313]  You understand the robber barons have been pushing for this for a long time.
[01:11:50.313 --> 01:11:51.714]  Now it's here.
[01:11:51.714 --> 01:11:54.315]  And so she's going to go over the Second Amendment.
[01:11:54.315 --> 01:12:02.899]  But to understand that, you've got to go back and understand the State Department, this all came out in congressional hearings, is run by these offshore banks now.
[01:12:02.899 --> 01:12:09.522]  That's why they've gotten to the point of admitting that we've been conquered by foreign banks on CNBC and all this.
[01:12:09.522 --> 01:12:12.823]  But they say it's good to be under this unelected global government.
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.083]  So this is probably the most important information out there.
[01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:24.673]  People like Rosa Corey write a great little 180-page book, Behind the Green Mask, that we sell at Infowarshop.com.
[01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:30.920]  It's great to give county, city, people so they understand the buzzwords and this global government standardization.
[01:12:31.761 --> 01:12:38.144]  But if you really want to understand the wider breadth and depth, Bernadine Smith.
[01:12:38.144 --> 01:12:40.084]  And so, Bernadine, it's great to have you here.
[01:12:40.084 --> 01:12:41.145]  You know I get excited.
[01:12:41.145 --> 01:12:45.307]  I'm going to try my best today to sit back and just guide us in and out of the breaks.
[01:12:45.307 --> 01:12:52.770]  And while you're talking, for a record, we also have cameras in here so I can show exhibits, as you mentioned, the page number.
[01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:55.651]  So just, you'll have the floor here to break down
[01:12:56.631 --> 01:13:18.747]  Your research, the big picture, then I'd like to begin at the start of it and go through the system we're now pretty much under and ways to turn this around because the knowledge of this blueprint that you've reverse engineered and that has been proven to be stunningly accurate is the only way out of this.
[01:13:18.747 --> 01:13:20.669]  If we can get this message to the people,
[01:13:21.349 --> 01:13:28.996]  Evidence shows that they will understand it's illegitimate and fraudulent, and that we can say no to it.
[01:13:28.996 --> 01:13:31.998]  So again, Bernadine Smith, great to have you with us.
[01:13:31.998 --> 01:13:34.901]  Where should we start here today?
[01:13:34.901 --> 01:13:49.473]  Well, I think we have to address the fact that the Small Arms Treaty is coming up, and every treaty has to have what they call enabling legislation, which applies
[01:13:50.031 --> 01:13:55.594]  To that particular member that is a party to the treaty.
[01:13:55.594 --> 01:14:09.203]  So there is legislation that is prepared, and if we allow it to continue, it will force us to be totally and completely disarmed.
[01:14:09.203 --> 01:14:14.186]  Even our military will no longer belong to our own country.
[01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:27.276]  As it is now, it practically doesn't because they use it for whatever they need to force other countries to comply with a plan for a world government.
[01:14:27.276 --> 01:14:39.982]  A world government, as you've probably had a lot of shows on that, people return once again to being serfs on the land that their forefathers had conquered.
[01:14:40.538 --> 01:14:46.460]  So, it isn't that we are trying to stop something that is good.
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.962]  We're trying to stop things that are bad.
[01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:56.545]  When people are totally and completely disarmed, they have no authority whatsoever.
[01:14:56.545 --> 01:15:03.648]  And as you know, everyone knows that the United States is a republic.
[01:15:03.648 --> 01:15:09.450]  And the definition of a republic is that the people themselves are
[01:15:10.123 --> 01:15:10.523]  We're good to go.
[01:15:37.529 --> 01:15:41.351]  To take away the guns from the people.
[01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:42.492]  You know that.
[01:15:42.492 --> 01:15:57.741]  And I think most people have seen this since, well at least since 1971 when they started out with the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.
[01:15:57.741 --> 01:16:04.865]  That was a guiding commission.
[01:16:05.606 --> 01:16:33.447]  That the federal government set up and they took over every state and they tried to get them to agree to changing, well they did, they got them to agree to changing their standards and their goals of operation within their criminal justice system throughout their whole state.
[01:16:36.293 --> 01:16:40.456]  A lot of the, well, all of the states comply.
[01:16:40.456 --> 01:17:02.787]  And the bottom line is that when the submission of their final version of improvements in their standards of operation and goals and so on, there were some pages that were unauthorized up to this point.
[01:17:03.656 --> 01:17:06.539]  All of the work had been authorized by the people.
[01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:14.806]  They were willing to update and make everything easier and more safe for the people.
[01:17:14.806 --> 01:17:22.512]  And that was the main theme was that they were going to reduce crime.
[01:17:22.512 --> 01:17:29.458]  But what the bottom line and the truth of it was that they were intending from the onset
[01:17:30.683 --> 01:17:32.584]  to take away the guns from the people.
[01:17:32.584 --> 01:17:36.285]  Now those two things are not synonymous.
[01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:52.330]  You cannot take away the people's guns and then have them live under liberty and have a republic where the people are the authority.
[01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:54.910]  Once they lose the guns, they're not the authority anymore.
[01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:56.151]  They're helpless.
[01:17:56.151 --> 01:18:00.412]  No matter what comes along, if they're not armed
[01:18:01.198 --> 01:18:08.924]  And able to resist, they are, you know, more or less served again.
[01:18:08.924 --> 01:18:26.856]  So, anyhow, we were fortunate enough that one very brave person had the nerve to go into a federal office in California, in Sacramento.
[01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:34.943]  He demanded that they give him certain documents.
[01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:40.064]  These are what they were up to, that they were planning secretly to get the gun.
[01:18:40.064 --> 01:18:45.945]  And, um, so he tried to get, um, and he did.
[01:18:45.945 --> 01:18:56.528]  He, uh, finally convinced the, um, man that was in charge of the office, uh, to allow him to go past the swinging gates.
[01:18:56.528 --> 01:18:58.068]  And, uh, he took
[01:18:58.986 --> 01:19:04.030]  Uh, enough documents to fill the back of his car.
[01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:17.139]  And, um, he came to see me because he knew that I was also fighting against the, um, gun grab and the plan for total and complete disarmament.
[01:19:17.139 --> 01:19:19.561]  Which is no, no secret.
[01:19:19.561 --> 01:19:23.003]  Anybody can go in the internet and look up Public Law 87297.
[01:19:25.784 --> 01:19:32.877]  And they'll see that our government is planning to give our military to the UN.
[01:19:32.877 --> 01:19:34.921]  We'll have no military whatsoever.
[01:19:34.921 --> 01:19:37.146]  No army, no navy, no air force.
[01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:49.281]  And we will be more or less captives of a communist world government.
[01:19:49.281 --> 01:19:53.164]  Well, Bernadine Smith, let's go over these documents because almost all these are public.
[01:19:53.164 --> 01:19:54.405]  We've got copies of them right here.
[01:19:54.405 --> 01:19:55.726]  We're showing viewers.
[01:19:55.726 --> 01:19:57.948]  Radio listeners can later watch this video.
[01:19:57.948 --> 01:20:00.710]  We'll post it at Infowars.com tomorrow.
[01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:02.591]  The worst drought in 50 years continues.
[01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:07.193]  And the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:20:07.193 --> 01:20:09.794]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:20:09.794 --> 01:20:15.176]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:20:15.176 --> 01:20:20.157]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:20:20.157 --> 01:20:27.460]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food costs to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.664]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:20:31.664 --> 01:20:33.466]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:20:33.466 --> 01:20:37.469]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[01:20:37.469 --> 01:20:40.372]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:20:40.372 --> 01:20:43.155]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[01:20:43.155 --> 01:20:47.719]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:20:47.719 --> 01:20:48.380]  Don't wait!
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:48.620]  Call 800-409-5633.

[01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:02.190]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:08.275]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[01:21:08.275 --> 01:21:16.482]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[01:21:16.482 --> 01:21:22.126]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.

[01:21:24.648 --> 01:21:34.695]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[01:22:00.012 --> 01:22:04.795]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:07.817]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:22:07.817 --> 01:22:16.123]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:22:16.773 --> 01:22:22.338]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:22:22.338 --> 01:22:33.708]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:22:33.708 --> 01:22:40.715]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:22:41.375 --> 01:22:45.678]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:22:45.678 --> 01:22:49.280]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:56.545]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:22:56.545 --> 01:22:57.826]  Protect your immune system.
[01:22:57.826 --> 01:22:58.847]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:22:59.997 --> 01:23:00.998]  Hi there.
[01:23:00.998 --> 01:23:02.519]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:06.341]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:23:06.341 --> 01:23:15.487]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:23:15.487 --> 01:23:22.212]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:23:22.212 --> 01:23:24.393]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:23:24.393 --> 01:23:29.477]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:23:30.197 --> 01:23:38.144]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:23:38.144 --> 01:23:43.729]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:43.729 --> 01:23:50.234]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:55.959]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:55.959 --> 01:23:57.220]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:24:12.082 --> 01:24:16.747]  Get up, stand up, stand up for your right.
[01:24:16.747 --> 01:24:19.310]  Get up, stand up, stand up for your right.
[01:24:34.323 --> 01:24:39.867]  Alright, this is a short 6-minute segment, big 18-minute segment coming up.
[01:24:39.867 --> 01:24:46.411]  And for about 20-30 minutes of the next hour, we'll open the phones up for Bernadine Smith if you've got any Second Amendment questions.
[01:24:46.411 --> 01:24:53.076]  Now again, if you're a radio listener, you can't see this, but I've got three big giant binders here.
[01:24:53.076 --> 01:24:54.437]  One of them is about...
[01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:58.091]  Four and a half inches thick, or more.
[01:24:58.091 --> 01:25:08.075]  It's got the actual copy from the State Department, Freedom from War, the United States program for general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world.
[01:25:08.075 --> 01:25:14.298]  It's got the New York Times, it's got the LA Times, actually calling for world government.
[01:25:15.322 --> 01:25:20.584]  And by the way, we sent guys down years later to UT, to the microfilm, to get the actual copies of this.
[01:25:20.584 --> 01:25:24.586]  That's why you see some of these in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:33.750]  Not that I was checking in on Bernadine Smith, I just wanted to show the microfilm spinning and, you know, have some shots of our guys down there, you know, for the film.
[01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:38.231]  Like, we went to the library, you know, as a way to illustrate it to people.
[01:25:38.231 --> 01:25:38.792]  It's there.
[01:25:38.792 --> 01:25:42.133]  Everything in there, everything she's got in here is at the library, folks.
[01:25:42.133 --> 01:25:43.033]  You know, at a big library.
[01:25:43.033 --> 01:25:44.114]  They'll have it in the microfiche.
[01:25:45.226 --> 01:25:49.487]  And this is what we're talking about.
[01:25:49.487 --> 01:25:51.328]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:25:51.328 --> 01:25:53.088]  It's all in congressional hearings.
[01:25:53.088 --> 01:25:54.009]  It's all admitted.
[01:25:54.009 --> 01:25:59.690]  The end of the family, the end of farms, the end of private property, the end of your guns.
[01:25:59.690 --> 01:26:00.750]  They've got to get that first.
[01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:01.631]  And now the U.N.
[01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:07.572]  Treaty says in Article 15, I want to go over some of that with her, that they're going to take your guns and use foreign governments to do it.
[01:26:07.572 --> 01:26:09.393]  Exactly what's in State Department memorandum.
[01:26:11.235 --> 01:26:12.936]  Exactly what's broken down by 7277.
[01:26:12.936 --> 01:26:15.457]  This is a plan.
[01:26:15.457 --> 01:26:17.378]  And people are like, well, we're waking up.
[01:26:17.378 --> 01:26:18.719]  Guns are more popular.
[01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:19.799]  We're reversing stuff.
[01:26:19.799 --> 01:26:21.480]  Yeah, but they don't care.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:31.925]  They've introduced bills now to ban all semi-autos and ban clips of 10 or larger and ban ammo sales online and register and all this stuff.
[01:26:31.925 --> 01:26:35.767]  And the media is saying we're conspiracy theorists if we think they want
[01:26:37.153 --> 01:26:44.855]  Our guns, even though when they're in control of a country or in control of a city like Newark or Chicago, they totally confiscate them.
[01:26:44.855 --> 01:26:56.118]  Bernardine, I'm going back to you here, but just before we go to this long segment coming up and really get into the history of this and the documents, and as you talk about them, I'll flip through them here for people watching at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:26:56.118 --> 01:27:02.320]  And again, tomorrow we'll archive this on InfoWars.com for everybody, the full video, and I hope everyone gets it out to people.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.340]  But this is the proof
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:11.582]  What is it like for you when they introduce bills to ban or restrict guns, and then say, we're conspiracy theorists, we don't want your guns?
[01:27:11.582 --> 01:27:14.643]  I mean, just the incredible level of deception.
[01:27:14.643 --> 01:27:25.446]  And then, what do you make of Time Magazine saying how guns won, and they admit America has turned against guns, but they go on to say it doesn't matter, they know best, they've got to ban our guns.
[01:27:25.446 --> 01:27:31.388]  What do you make of, in the three minutes we've got before we go to break again, what is the current state of the fight?
[01:27:31.388 --> 01:27:32.888]  You know, like the state of the union.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:47.886]  Well, the current state is that they're trying to introduce legislation to the Small Arms Treaty that all guns will be prohibited and you will have to surrender them.
[01:27:47.886 --> 01:27:53.489]  They even have plans for surrender agencies by which you have to turn in your guns.
[01:27:53.489 --> 01:27:57.371]  And if that isn't enough, they'll have foreign troops here.
[01:27:57.891 --> 01:28:06.319]  That will go house to house and search your home for any guns or any in your backyard that you may have hidden.
[01:28:06.319 --> 01:28:17.029]  They intend to trip us entirely of any possibility of remaining the ultimate power and keeping the Republic.
[01:28:17.029 --> 01:28:21.013]  They want a world government, as you know that.
[01:28:24.454 --> 01:28:36.363]  The main thing that I'm trying to bring out is that they have lied about having the permission of the people to take away the guns.
[01:28:36.363 --> 01:28:39.965]  They cannot take them away without our permission.
[01:28:39.965 --> 01:28:45.929]  So they have falsified the permission of the people to be disarmed.
[01:28:45.929 --> 01:28:53.035]  And that's the crux of the whole matter that has me publishing this
[01:28:53.942 --> 01:28:54.803]  We're good to go.
[01:29:13.982 --> 01:29:24.627]  When they studied the judicial system, and this was done in every state, not just California, we got to watch it in California.
[01:29:24.627 --> 01:29:34.052]  And we got to find out that they were slipping in at the back of a thick brown book that I sent you.
[01:29:34.052 --> 01:29:42.275]  They slipped in as an official entry that the people had given their permission to be disarmed.
[01:29:42.275 --> 01:29:42.936]  In other words,
[01:29:43.857 --> 01:29:44.878]  Stay there, stay there!
[01:29:44.878 --> 01:29:48.242]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.242 --> 01:29:49.503]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.586 --> 01:30:03.608]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:30:03.608 --> 01:30:08.631]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:30:08.631 --> 01:30:15.796]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:30:15.936 --> 01:30:21.558]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:30:21.558 --> 01:30:25.599]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:30:46.287 --> 01:30:49.168]  Hand cranked shortwave AM FM radios.

[01:32:00.508 --> 01:32:01.789]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.789 --> 01:32:07.372]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.372 --> 01:32:12.395]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.395 --> 01:32:17.438]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:32:17.958 --> 01:32:23.180]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:25.500]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:30.302]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.302 --> 01:32:31.422]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.422 --> 01:32:34.483]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:34.483 --> 01:32:37.784]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.104 --> 01:32:41.287]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.287 --> 01:32:43.509]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:43.509 --> 01:32:44.450]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:44.650]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:48.093]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:48.093 --> 01:32:49.835]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:04.727 --> 01:33:12.651]  We're going back to Bernadine Smith here in just a moment, but the message here is really very, very simple.
[01:33:12.651 --> 01:33:16.233]  There are public plans, public documents.
[01:33:16.233 --> 01:33:17.273]  You can read the U.N.
[01:33:17.273 --> 01:33:19.174]  Treaty.
[01:33:19.174 --> 01:33:21.275]  You can read 7277.
[01:33:21.275 --> 01:33:22.856]  You can read any of it.
[01:33:22.856 --> 01:33:25.117]  And then you're like, wow, that's what's happening today.
[01:33:26.297 --> 01:33:29.439]  And this is only part of the physical disarmament.
[01:33:29.439 --> 01:33:31.420]  Then they're going to cut off the power plants.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.721]  That's now starting.
[01:33:32.721 --> 01:33:34.963]  They're going to take your farms, your ranches.
[01:33:34.963 --> 01:33:39.245]  They're not going to let you sell things out in the country on the side of the highway.
[01:33:39.245 --> 01:33:40.226]  That's already happening.
[01:33:41.479 --> 01:33:44.341]  The only jobs are going to be government enforcers.
[01:33:44.341 --> 01:33:54.706]  They've had NLEO 9, 10, and 11, these FEMA drills, where FEMA put out press releases saying, troops from 15 nations are training to take on American terrorists.
[01:33:54.706 --> 01:33:58.728]  And they've got the ABC News shows demonizing militias and gun owners.
[01:33:58.728 --> 01:34:03.391]  News shows coming out like Founding Fathers, where evil Texans won't turn their guns in.
[01:34:03.391 --> 01:34:04.952]  But don't worry, they get what's coming to them.
[01:34:05.692 --> 01:34:16.197]  You have the training manuals that FEMA gets down to the police, where they say the gun owners are bad, the founders are bad, Ron Paul's bad, Alex Jones is bad, Chuck Baldwin's bad.
[01:34:16.197 --> 01:34:17.978]  There's hundreds of these.
[01:34:17.978 --> 01:34:19.919]  And it's actually woken up a lot of police.
[01:34:19.919 --> 01:34:25.522]  But for those of us that live studying this stuff, we know exactly what's going on.
[01:34:25.522 --> 01:34:33.506]  And it's frustrating to see other people out there who are not aware of what's happening.
[01:34:34.693 --> 01:34:45.349]  Now, as Bernadette Smith's been talking, I've been going over some of the documents that she's discussing, but I'm looking at one document here that is the New World Order.
[01:34:47.304 --> 01:34:51.005]  The 10 groups instead of the 50 states.
[01:34:51.005 --> 01:34:55.607]  And then she's got it out of the New York Times, April 21st, 1935.
[01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:57.827]  Sorry, I was thinking 37.
[01:34:57.827 --> 01:35:00.128]  Nine groups instead of 48 states.
[01:35:00.128 --> 01:35:13.072]  The map of the United States, as it might be redrawn under the revision of states' rights, would be abolished and the country would be divided into nine departments.
[01:35:13.072 --> 01:35:13.833]  Well, they divided them into 10.
[01:35:15.225 --> 01:35:21.491]  And so they have this parallel, and here's the original New York Times article, nine groups instead of 48 states.
[01:35:21.491 --> 01:35:26.976]  It talks about the great experts and how they're going to, and see, that's already been done.
[01:35:26.976 --> 01:35:33.122]  Notice it's pretty much the same regions too, just unbelievable how they've done all of this.
[01:35:33.122 --> 01:35:36.486]  And I've got to do a whole report just on this invaluable information.
[01:35:39.130 --> 01:35:40.351]  And then today's reality.
[01:35:40.351 --> 01:35:43.132]  So again, this is already in place.
[01:35:43.132 --> 01:35:50.175]  They're just, they're absorbing the old system and kind of leaving it there so they can point at it ceremonially.
[01:35:50.175 --> 01:35:53.217]  But the final thing they haven't gotten is our families and our guns.
[01:35:54.335 --> 01:36:00.178]  So now they have all these TV shows saying having a family is not normal, it's bad.
[01:36:00.178 --> 01:36:01.799]  It's not the new normal.
[01:36:01.799 --> 01:36:07.142]  They've got bombarding these images scientifically, like Miss Magazine was heard about the CIA.
[01:36:07.142 --> 01:36:10.964]  Not to empower women, to destroy them, to make sure they were alone.
[01:36:10.964 --> 01:36:13.246]  And so the state can now be their husband.
[01:36:13.846 --> 01:36:15.227]  And it's all in these documents.
[01:36:15.227 --> 01:36:19.070]  We have Charlotte Iserby on, who is the number two in the Department of Education.
[01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:21.532]  Dad and grandfather, you know, skull and bones.
[01:36:21.532 --> 01:36:23.714]  She spilled all that information.
[01:36:23.714 --> 01:36:25.315]  And it's their world.
[01:36:25.315 --> 01:36:29.458]  The point is, these documents, they did it.
[01:36:29.458 --> 01:36:31.020]  It happened.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:36.064]  I want to get back into the Second Amendment, the UN Treaty, where we are now, what their master plan is, Bernie Smith.
[01:36:38.119 --> 01:36:57.829]  What is it like for you to be fighting this 30, 40 years, you can correct me on the dates, and to now know that, I mean, you knew it was real, but to actually see them implementing it, and if you and others hadn't been there, I know they would have already had a lot of this implemented, what is the timeframe on all this?
[01:36:57.829 --> 01:37:00.370]  Well, I'm not able to tell you that.
[01:37:00.370 --> 01:37:04.692]  I mean, they're going to adjust their timeframe
[01:37:05.827 --> 01:37:27.858]  According to their progress, and they're making quite a bit of progress, because who has contested the law that was signed by Kennedy in 1961 that moves our armed forces to international control?
[01:37:27.858 --> 01:37:32.661]  In other words, the United Nations, which is composed of communists as well as
[01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:56.580]  The purpose behind the whole thing is to have a world army and a world government and people will be unarmed and unable to object to the fact that they can't own land anymore.
[01:37:57.068 --> 01:38:05.391]  That's one of the tenets of the New World Order is that all land belongs to the world government.
[01:38:05.391 --> 01:38:08.392]  You can pay rent on it, but you can't own it.
[01:38:08.392 --> 01:38:17.415]  And the use of your automobile will have to be prescribed according to what your needs are.
[01:38:17.415 --> 01:38:23.157]  If you can't carry your parcels, then maybe you can use your automobile.
[01:38:23.157 --> 01:38:24.638]  There's all kinds of
[01:38:25.293 --> 01:38:28.936]  Plans that are different from the American way of life.
[01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:53.796]  And for us, we have never given our permission, but the main thing is, that I'm objecting to, is that they have lied about having our permission to remove all arms and guns from personal possession.
[01:38:54.677 --> 01:39:05.542]  And without having arms, then we are not able to defend ourselves against these kinds of plans.
[01:39:05.542 --> 01:39:18.168]  The reason that they have been so slow, yes, it started in, well, even before Kennedy signed in 1961 for us to be completely disarmed.
[01:39:19.867 --> 01:39:32.571]  The reason it went so slow is that the people did grab on to what was happening, and the Internet, of course, gave us the opportunity to dig out these documents.
[01:39:32.571 --> 01:39:41.074]  Plus, by writing to the State Department, you could get publications that they had to send you.
[01:39:43.237 --> 01:39:46.558]  But they're claiming that we gave our permission.
[01:39:46.558 --> 01:40:08.529]  That is the thing that gets me, is that we never gave our permission to be disarmed or to have a world government or to get rid of our republic, which places limitations on the power that public officials can exercise over the people.
[01:40:09.486 --> 01:40:25.191]  And we would be very foolish not to defend what George Washington and our founding fathers did for us, because thereby we do have liberty and true freedom.
[01:40:25.191 --> 01:40:35.715]  So, like I have said before, Kennedy was the one that signed a bill which reads this way.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:41:04.515]  It says, the terms arms control and disarmament mean the identification, verification, inspection, limitation, control, reduction, or elimination of armed forces, of armed forces and armaments of all kinds under international agreement, including the necessary steps taken under such an agreement to establish an effective system of
[01:41:05.186 --> 01:41:14.273]  International control and to create and strengthen international organizations for the maintenance of peace.
[01:41:14.273 --> 01:41:23.419]  So the United Nations is a stand-in for what all they have lined up as a world government.
[01:41:23.419 --> 01:41:32.126]  I've seen three different constitutions that they have for world government and it will not bring
[01:41:32.902 --> 01:41:39.967]  Uh, the enjoyment of life that we have had under our Constitution.
[01:41:39.967 --> 01:41:44.470]  But the main thing is that we have never given our permission.
[01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:48.611]  And that is the thing that I'm trying to expose today.
[01:41:48.611 --> 01:41:49.112]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:41:49.112 --> 01:41:54.654]  Let's talk about State Department Document 7277 that I have a copy of right here in this binder you sent me.
[01:41:54.654 --> 01:41:58.576]  And again, I actually went to the University of Texas back when you first sent it to me.
[01:41:58.576 --> 01:42:02.057]  I guess it was in 98 or 97 and actually pulled it myself.
[01:42:02.057 --> 01:42:03.478]  And again, it wasn't that I didn't believe you.
[01:42:03.478 --> 01:42:06.519]  I wanted to have it myself and I checked one out.
[01:42:07.259 --> 01:42:09.441]  And it had the same blue cover and everything.
[01:42:09.441 --> 01:42:13.863]  Also later got one that was a brown cover, actually from the early 1960s.
[01:42:13.863 --> 01:42:17.366]  I guess later they issued them in a blue cover.
[01:42:17.366 --> 01:42:22.169]  But it states, we will have no military and the UN will be here.
[01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:24.050]  And that's actually in the new UN treaty.
[01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:33.456]  It says they will use, in Article 15, troops who are given, like mercenaries, to the UN will be sent into states to disarm the people.
[01:42:34.156 --> 01:42:49.868]  It's just absolutely incredible and it again it shows our military is getting small and then it shows the UN army building up and this is all from State Department 7277.
[01:42:49.868 --> 01:42:52.990]  It's also out of blueprint for the peace race.
[01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:58.755]  But we're not talking about peace, we're talking about no one being able to oppose them and
[01:42:59.938 --> 01:43:03.041]  Seeing this now, we see what the U.N.
[01:43:03.041 --> 01:43:08.506]  does all over the world, where they've seen it in the New York Times, that they send the U.N.
[01:43:08.506 --> 01:43:18.696]  into Uganda and Honduras and other areas, and actually they murder whole villages and take them over saying it's to be an environmental preserve, and I even saw a decade ago a
[01:43:20.905 --> 01:43:21.726]  What's that?
[01:43:21.726 --> 01:43:23.387]  National Geographic Magazine.
[01:43:23.387 --> 01:43:28.530]  And they were showing UN troops in Burma, driving people off the land to make it a UN sanctuary.
[01:43:28.530 --> 01:43:31.232]  But really, they were just taking it to mine it.
[01:43:31.232 --> 01:43:34.074]  I mean, the UN is such a murderous group.
[01:43:34.074 --> 01:43:38.937]  The sex slavery, the child kidnapping, the drug dealing, the diplomatic community.
[01:43:38.937 --> 01:43:39.278]  And now...
[01:43:39.938 --> 01:43:43.321]  These global interests are trying to give diplomatic immunity to the big banks.
[01:43:43.321 --> 01:43:45.042]  They're trying to give it to Monsanto.
[01:43:45.042 --> 01:43:53.269]  I mean, it's just a license to be like kings, as you said at the start of the interview, and we, the slaves or the serfs.
[01:43:53.269 --> 01:44:08.621]  But did you see CNBC a month ago admit that global government is here and run by foreign banks and that Europe is under dictatorial rule of the technocrats and that suddenly hundreds of news articles, Time, Newsweek, Financial Times,
[01:44:09.401 --> 01:44:15.466]  We've shown the articles here saying, yes we've been conquered, but it's a good thing and freedom is bad.
[01:44:15.466 --> 01:44:16.847]  I mean, so now...
[01:44:18.649 --> 01:44:22.771]  I mean, I'm sure you've seen it, but give us your take if you have, and then B... Yes, I have.
[01:44:22.771 --> 01:44:24.072]  Okay, so you have seen it.
[01:44:24.072 --> 01:44:26.553]  Why are they suddenly going from stealth?
[01:44:26.553 --> 01:44:29.114]  Because back in the 60s and 70s, you have the documents.
[01:44:29.114 --> 01:44:30.235]  They admitted the whole plan.
[01:44:30.235 --> 01:44:32.035]  Even back in the 30s, you have them.
[01:44:32.035 --> 01:44:35.197]  They implemented a lot of it, but then we slowed them down.
[01:44:35.197 --> 01:44:40.179]  Now, even though we're more awake than ever, are they racing to the finish line?
[01:44:40.179 --> 01:44:41.160]  Or am I wrong?
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.161]  I mean, do you agree that they're just racing right now?
[01:44:44.741 --> 01:44:48.724]  You know, I don't really have all the answers.
[01:44:48.724 --> 01:44:53.567]  The people vote the wrong kind of leaders into office.
[01:44:53.567 --> 01:44:59.451]  And it's because they don't understand what the problem is.
[01:44:59.451 --> 01:45:09.678]  And the problem is that they have said that we have agreed to be disarmed and that we want moral government.
[01:45:09.678 --> 01:45:10.498]  Now, these are lies.
[01:45:10.498 --> 01:45:12.119]  And I went to a
[01:45:15.968 --> 01:45:26.797]  Oh, I forget what they call her, but I had a statement made, um, by, um, oh, um, oh, what do you call it?
[01:45:26.797 --> 01:45:27.638]  A public, um...
[01:45:30.062 --> 01:45:42.346]  Anyway, it was an affidavit, and I had it attested to, that told that we had never actually studied the gun issue.
[01:45:42.346 --> 01:45:53.009]  I talked to a person when I was in Sacramento, at the time we were trying to stop what was going on, when it was in the highest limits of opposition.
[01:45:55.245 --> 01:45:57.406]  Two people brought this woman over.
[01:45:57.406 --> 01:46:06.811]  She was a member of one of the committees that was working under our state governor at that time, who happened to be Ronald Reagan.
[01:46:06.811 --> 01:46:12.653]  And she told me that they never studied the gun issue.
[01:46:12.653 --> 01:46:19.357]  She said, I have never missed a meeting of my committee or the subcommittees.
[01:46:19.357 --> 01:46:24.299]  She never missed any of the required meetings, or any of the meetings, period.
[01:46:25.232 --> 01:46:30.013]  And they never touched into the subject of the gun issue.
[01:46:30.013 --> 01:46:43.077]  And yet, when the final work came out, here was this book with the consent for the people, or from the people, to agree that their guns could be prohibited.
[01:46:44.176 --> 01:46:55.040]  And also, the other page which followed that page was number 341, which approved of change that they wanted.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.581]  The public wanted things changed.
[01:46:58.581 --> 01:47:12.966]  Well, we don't want things changed to a detriment, but we'd certainly like to change it that we could get rid of lying public officials and ones that want to overthrow our system and our republic.
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:23.957]  But this is where we stand now, is that they are pushing for us to honor them to the Small Arms Treaty.
[01:47:25.996 --> 01:47:38.881]  You know, we're going to have to give up our guns and what I'm trying to publicize for Alex is so that we can avoid a civil war because people are not going to go along with this.
[01:47:38.881 --> 01:47:49.425]  They're going to fight when they're told that they have to give up their guns and the government is going to fight because they're going to consider that they have our permission.
[01:47:49.425 --> 01:47:52.526]  So that is the crux of what
[01:47:53.672 --> 01:48:08.584]  The Civil War that can happen here will be centered around if that one group is going to say that you did give up your permission, the other group will say we didn't.
[01:48:08.584 --> 01:48:10.865]  Well, the fact is that they didn't.
[01:48:10.865 --> 01:48:12.146]  The people didn't.
[01:48:12.146 --> 01:48:19.832]  These pages were put into the work that was done, as we talked about in...
[01:48:21.585 --> 01:48:22.226]  Oh, okay.
[01:48:36.969 --> 01:48:37.650]  We're good to go.
[01:48:52.042 --> 01:48:52.222]  Well, um...
[01:49:16.155 --> 01:49:24.261]  We put the whole binder, I think there's 75 pages in that binder, and we put the whole binder on my website.
[01:49:24.261 --> 01:49:33.907]  And if anybody wants to see it, all they have to do is go into www.libertygunrights.com.
[01:49:33.907 --> 01:49:34.948]  I'll say it again.
[01:49:36.017 --> 01:49:43.560]  www.LibertyGunRights.com.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:46.302]  And I think it's the second category.
[01:49:46.302 --> 01:49:49.203]  We have a lot of documents on the website.
[01:49:49.203 --> 01:49:50.523]  It's a big website.
[01:49:50.523 --> 01:49:53.104]  And notice this is all Obama-style words.
[01:49:53.104 --> 01:49:55.365]  A national commitment to change.
[01:49:55.365 --> 01:49:57.706]  But again, federal encouragement.
[01:49:57.706 --> 01:50:00.087]  Explain to people what this document is again.
[01:50:00.087 --> 01:50:00.948]  The document itself.
[01:50:03.441 --> 01:50:07.984]  Well, you mean the one for the falsification?
[01:50:07.984 --> 01:50:09.145]  Yes.
[01:50:09.145 --> 01:50:15.970]  Well, I sent you a copy, but I've sent it around to important people.
[01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:24.755]  For one of them, it happens to be Rand Paul, and I've been checking with his office.
[01:50:24.755 --> 01:50:31.800]  I sent it about two weeks ago, and they tell me that whenever they get a package, it's held up in the mailroom.
[01:50:33.604 --> 01:50:33.985]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:50:33.985 --> 01:50:35.125]  We've got to go to break.
[01:50:35.125 --> 01:50:35.485]  Stay there.
[01:50:35.485 --> 01:50:37.026]  You're not understanding my question.
[01:50:37.026 --> 01:50:39.008]  There's a bunch of different documents in here.
[01:50:39.008 --> 01:50:46.492]  I'd like to name the documents for people, and I understand they're on your website, and I'd like to be able to direct them specifically to it.
[01:50:46.492 --> 01:50:53.716]  Because there's so many here, I want to know which ones specifically you're going to out of the 70-plus pages in this particular binder.
[01:50:53.716 --> 01:50:56.938]  Bernadine Smith is our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:56.938 --> 01:50:58.919]  Key information straight ahead.
[01:50:58.919 --> 01:51:00.280]  We've got the Enemy Zone documents.
[01:51:00.816 --> 01:51:06.822]  Would it save you time to get the best quality water filters and the best quality storable foods from one company?
[01:51:06.822 --> 01:51:07.843]  You bet it would!
[01:51:07.843 --> 01:51:09.225]  And now you can!

[01:52:00.450 --> 01:52:01.971]  We take a lot for granted.
[01:52:01.971 --> 01:52:04.333]  Lights, water, even food we eat.
[01:52:04.333 --> 01:52:05.915]  But what if these things went away?
[01:52:05.915 --> 01:52:09.318]  Would you know how to protect your family in a natural or man-made disaster?
[01:52:09.318 --> 01:52:10.779]  Would you know how to survive?
[01:52:10.779 --> 01:52:15.944]  When disaster hits, power and water are gone and the mobs go crazy grabbing food off the shelves.
[01:52:15.944 --> 01:52:18.926]  You and your family may be waiting in long lines for help.
[01:52:18.926 --> 01:52:20.187]  Don't be helpless.

[01:52:38.957 --> 01:52:42.398]  The government suggests we maintain an emergency supply of food and water.
[01:52:42.398 --> 01:52:47.659]  But do you know the 37 food items that will fly off grocery shelves are a simple way to treat unsafe drinking water?
[01:52:47.659 --> 01:52:49.060]  This information is critical.

[01:52:55.369 --> 01:52:56.831]  That's 123survivalplan.com.
[01:53:00.609 --> 01:53:01.610]  Hi there.
[01:53:01.610 --> 01:53:03.131]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:53:03.131 --> 01:53:06.953]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:53:06.953 --> 01:53:16.119]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:53:16.119 --> 01:53:22.824]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:53:22.824 --> 01:53:25.005]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:53:25.005 --> 01:53:30.089]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:53:30.809 --> 01:53:38.755]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:53:38.755 --> 01:53:44.339]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:53:44.339 --> 01:53:50.843]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:53:50.843 --> 01:53:56.567]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:53:56.567 --> 01:53:57.828]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:54:03.598 --> 01:54:10.231]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:54:10.231 --> 01:54:13.217]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:15.785 --> 01:54:18.327]  Bernadine Smith's going to be with us 30 minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:18.327 --> 01:54:20.388]  We're going to open the phones up.
[01:54:20.388 --> 01:54:23.191]  The last 20 minutes or so of that.
[01:54:23.191 --> 01:54:25.933]  But let me explain why this is so important.
[01:54:25.933 --> 01:54:29.355]  I know you know that the UN and the globalists want our guns.
[01:54:29.355 --> 01:54:32.397]  They disarm people all over the world and line them up and shoot them.
[01:54:32.397 --> 01:54:34.479]  Bring in Al-Qaeda in Libya, kill everybody.
[01:54:34.479 --> 01:54:37.421]  I mean, they're pure evil.
[01:54:37.421 --> 01:54:39.563]  Global government, eugenics bases are playing.
[01:54:40.461 --> 01:54:56.785]  But with this information, we can give them the State Department documents, public laws, the big law enforcement advisory commissions of Congress, and the Justice Department, and that's what I have right here, stating the goal is our total disarmament.
[01:54:56.785 --> 01:54:58.446]  This is what police chiefs are taught.
[01:54:59.844 --> 01:55:00.784]  Okay?
[01:55:00.784 --> 01:55:01.785]  This is what they're taught.
[01:55:01.785 --> 01:55:02.565]  This is their goal.
[01:55:02.565 --> 01:55:05.686]  So, it was never about public safety, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:05.686 --> 01:55:07.527]  It's about global government.
[01:55:07.527 --> 01:55:12.089]  They know in Chicago and New York it makes crime explode when they take lawful guns.
[01:55:12.089 --> 01:55:13.750]  They know all this.
[01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:15.791]  They want your guns to make you a slave.
[01:55:15.791 --> 01:55:17.271]  And I know you know that.
[01:55:17.271 --> 01:55:18.752]  Politicians love disarmed peasants.
[01:55:19.966 --> 01:55:20.607]  It's very simple.
[01:55:20.607 --> 01:55:25.531]  When Rome would come into an area, they'd take all the swords of the captured people, kill all the men.
[01:55:25.531 --> 01:55:27.192]  That's what this is all about.
[01:55:27.192 --> 01:55:28.994]  And now they're saying how guns won.
[01:55:28.994 --> 01:55:31.096]  We're winning the intellectual battle.
[01:55:31.096 --> 01:55:32.657]  But they don't care.
[01:55:32.657 --> 01:55:35.800]  They're saying, and in official public laws,
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:40.505]  That they've injected stuff into the law enforcement manuals that isn't part of the law.
[01:55:40.505 --> 01:55:41.887]  It's fraudulent.
[01:55:41.887 --> 01:55:43.409]  That's what she breaks down.
[01:55:43.409 --> 01:55:55.383]  They're teaching police chiefs and everybody with these federal advisory boards that she warned about 30 years ago that are now federalizing things publicly, saying that the people want their guns taken and saying it's a law.
[01:55:56.064 --> 01:56:03.152]  Just like they come to your door and want to know what kind of toilet you got and what type of bank statement you have under the census.
[01:56:03.152 --> 01:56:04.413]  And they say it's the law.
[01:56:04.413 --> 01:56:06.716]  No, it's the law to say how many people live there.
[01:56:06.716 --> 01:56:11.181]  That's what the code states, not what type of toilet you have or when you go to work in the morning.
[01:56:11.926 --> 01:56:14.088]  This is all fraud.
[01:56:14.088 --> 01:56:18.631]  And they know when they raise taxes in California, it's going to make it collapse.
[01:56:18.631 --> 01:56:23.995]  That's the other part of this global agenda, is Agenda 21 to shut off the resources.
[01:56:23.995 --> 01:56:25.837]  The guns are only one part of it.
[01:56:25.837 --> 01:56:36.104]  And man, when you're reading the New York Times and LA Times, saying they're going to have UN troops in every city, and now the Secretary of the Army is saying our military is under the UN and NATO, and they're going to be in every city.
[01:56:36.104 --> 01:56:37.666]  It's here, folks.
[01:56:37.666 --> 01:56:40.047]  Bernadine Smith, what is it like for you now
[01:56:40.928 --> 01:56:48.537]  To again, see them announcing world government, see them announcing troops in every city, but there are troops under NATO control.
[01:56:48.537 --> 01:56:52.241]  I mean, we're really deep into this, but it's a paradox.
[01:56:52.241 --> 01:57:01.471]  People are waking up, we've still got our guns, but the globalists are in control of the Federal Reserve, the federal government, they're looting us.
[01:57:02.452 --> 01:57:09.176]  So it's kind of a standoff, but it's not because they're busy shutting down our power plants, shipping GM to China.
[01:57:09.176 --> 01:57:11.158]  I mean, they're busy trying to bring us to our knees.
[01:57:11.158 --> 01:57:11.398]  Why?
[01:57:11.398 --> 01:57:18.242]  Just as you said before, they're looking for a complete world government.
[01:57:18.242 --> 01:57:23.466]  But, you know, the homeland security is one that really gets to me because
[01:57:24.267 --> 01:57:33.270]  It's against the law in our country to merge the military with the civilian law enforcement, and that has been done.
[01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:38.912]  If you do that, you move from being a republic to being a dictatorship.
[01:57:38.912 --> 01:57:46.214]  You cannot have the military and the civilian law enforcement together under one head, but we have that.
[01:57:46.883 --> 01:57:47.383]  I don't
[01:58:02.478 --> 01:58:13.426]  I'm hoping to get Rand Paul that would bring an investigation into these things, the changes in our system and the direction that they're taking us in.
[01:58:13.426 --> 01:58:19.750]  And if you get a large enough outcry in the country, you'll get some action.
[01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:20.590]  Exactly.
[01:58:20.590 --> 01:58:21.811]  We don't have that.
[01:58:21.811 --> 01:58:26.253]  We don't have as big an outcry as we need.
[01:58:26.253 --> 01:58:32.896]  People really should be telling their neighbors and their friends what is happening.
[01:58:32.896 --> 01:58:33.416]  Exactly.
[01:58:33.416 --> 01:58:33.896]  Stay there.
[01:58:33.896 --> 01:58:35.197]  Stay there.
[01:58:35.197 --> 01:58:35.997]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:35.997 --> 01:58:38.258]  Folks, America has been taken over.
[01:58:38.258 --> 01:58:41.359]  We've been occupied.
[01:58:41.359 --> 01:58:42.760]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.598 --> 01:59:07.073]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:59:07.073 --> 01:59:10.757]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:11.758 --> 01:59:24.529]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:59:24.529 --> 01:59:31.794]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[01:59:53.699 --> 01:59:56.079]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.079 --> 01:59:58.840]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:10.264]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.264 --> 02:00:11.865]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.865 --> 02:00:13.406]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.406 --> 02:00:17.609]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.609 --> 02:00:21.672]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.335 --> 02:00:39.676]  Bernadine Smith's our guest for another 30 minutes.
[02:00:39.676 --> 02:00:46.718]  If you want to talk to her, have any questions for her, the toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[02:00:46.718 --> 02:00:48.919]  And she founded the Second Amendment Committee.
[02:00:48.919 --> 02:00:52.500]  She's been a stalwart researcher on the global takeover.
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:01:00.690]  The best way to describe this is, robber barons in our own country in Europe set up the UN so they could transfer our sovereignty to it.
[02:01:00.690 --> 02:01:03.273]  It's not like the UN's taking us over.
[02:01:03.273 --> 02:01:08.680]  Traders within our government set it up to then parallel and move the power over into it.
[02:01:09.241 --> 02:01:15.784]  Now our military, they openly tell Congress, is under the UN and NATO, and now we're being told they're going to be on our streets.
[02:01:15.784 --> 02:01:22.346]  And we're told they're for us, the number one terrorist, conservative libertarians that believe in a world government.
[02:01:22.346 --> 02:01:24.127]  All the military training manuals say that.
[02:01:24.947 --> 02:01:27.788]  And they say we're insane, even as they announce it on the news.
[02:01:27.788 --> 02:01:36.173]  Bernadine, what about this paradox of world government doesn't exist and you're crazy if you say it, but world government's here to save you.
[02:01:36.173 --> 02:01:37.733]  I mean, that's just amazing.
[02:01:37.733 --> 02:01:40.455]  And then I want to continue along the lines of Rand Paul.
[02:01:40.455 --> 02:01:48.299]  Yes, we need to get Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, because no Democrat's going to win the Senate race now here in Texas up against him.
[02:01:49.494 --> 02:01:51.115]  Well, that's for sure.
[02:01:51.115 --> 02:01:53.056]  And what we're doing is we sent what you received from me, you know,
[02:02:13.875 --> 02:02:15.136]  Uh, the White Finder.
[02:02:15.136 --> 02:02:17.017]  Now, the White Finder is on my website.
[02:02:17.017 --> 02:02:19.739]  I just already talked about that on this program.
[02:02:19.739 --> 02:02:21.381]  It's 75 pages.
[02:02:21.381 --> 02:02:32.789]  But, um, all of this and the brown-covered book with the evidences of how they counterfeited our permission to disarm us.
[02:02:33.559 --> 02:02:49.386]  This has all been sent to Rand Paul and I think the best thing we can get people to do is to call Rand Paul's office and ask him to pursue this as an official study.
[02:02:49.386 --> 02:03:00.390]  Otherwise, I don't know how we're going to move without the cooperation of the federal government itself reporting on its own
[02:03:02.801 --> 02:03:04.543]  I don't know.
[02:03:15.071 --> 02:03:18.554]  But if they come for the guns, we have to resist.
[02:03:40.509 --> 02:03:41.309]  What's that again?
[02:03:41.309 --> 02:03:48.652]  Well that's what I'm saying, is that there will be a fight, people will not, they're not so ignorant as to turn in their guns when they get an order.
[02:04:00.228 --> 02:04:15.602]  They know better because without a republic... I can guarantee you, I can guarantee you most gun owners are going to hide their guns and then it'll make the gun culture even stronger and then a lot of people are going to start...
[02:04:16.610 --> 02:04:19.011]  Listen, Bernadine, that's what I've said.
[02:04:19.011 --> 02:04:21.453]  The plan is to start a civil war.
[02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:24.274]  I don't know if you ever hear my show, but I've been saying that every day for the last year.
[02:04:24.274 --> 02:04:31.658]  Well, unfortunately, I haven't heard it, but that's what I'm seeing is a civil war is in the offing.
[02:04:31.658 --> 02:04:38.521]  And unless this is brought out, we're not going to stop it.
[02:04:38.521 --> 02:04:40.762]  These facts have to be brought out.
[02:04:40.762 --> 02:04:45.505]  That's why you got what you got in the mailing with the white binder and the brown cover book.
[02:04:46.252 --> 02:04:46.813]  Absolutely.
[02:04:46.813 --> 02:04:52.623]  I want to come back and briefly get into the UN Treaty and talk about how they disarm people in other countries.
[02:04:52.623 --> 02:04:55.027]  And then we're going to take a few phone calls from Bernadine Smith.
[02:04:55.027 --> 02:04:58.513]  We'll give you her website so you can get to the PDFs of these documents.
[02:05:00.868 --> 02:05:07.393]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:05:07.393 --> 02:05:09.996]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:05:09.996 --> 02:05:15.380]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:18.643]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[02:05:18.823 --> 02:05:20.344]  Blowing up your food prices.
[02:05:20.344 --> 02:05:27.989]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[02:05:27.989 --> 02:05:31.852]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:05:31.852 --> 02:05:33.653]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:05:33.653 --> 02:05:37.676]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[02:05:37.676 --> 02:05:40.278]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:05:40.558 --> 02:05:43.341]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:05:43.341 --> 02:05:47.926]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:05:47.926 --> 02:05:48.566]  Don't wait!
[02:05:48.566 --> 02:05:51.029]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:05:51.029 --> 02:05:53.992]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:05:53.992 --> 02:05:55.533]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:06:00.678 --> 02:06:06.181]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:06:06.181 --> 02:06:08.603]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:06:08.603 --> 02:06:17.708]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:17.708 --> 02:06:21.151]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:06:21.151 --> 02:06:22.832]  There's no priming required.
[02:06:22.832 --> 02:06:25.113]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:06:25.113 --> 02:06:27.614]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:06:28.655 --> 02:06:30.195]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:06:30.195 --> 02:06:31.616]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:06:31.616 --> 02:06:34.777]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:06:34.777 --> 02:06:38.158]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:06:38.158 --> 02:06:42.299]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:06:42.299 --> 02:06:45.040]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:46.620]  It's what my family uses.
[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:49.921]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:06:49.921 --> 02:06:55.183]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[02:07:11.188 --> 02:07:12.168]  Why spend more?

[02:07:24.352 --> 02:07:27.754]  You could buy three Survival Seed Vaults for less than one of theirs.

[02:07:54.592 --> 02:08:06.309]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.309 --> 02:08:08.612]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:16.601 --> 02:08:16.681]  Yeah.
[02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:43.336]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen to this live worldwide broadcast.
[02:08:43.336 --> 02:08:51.065]  It is now already August 2nd 2012 here and Bernadine Smith with us for another 20 minutes or so.
[02:08:51.065 --> 02:08:53.608]  I want to go to some phone calls for her but if you just joined us
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:58.321]  She has been fighting for the Second Amendment for, I don't know, 30, 40 years.
[02:08:58.321 --> 02:09:00.541]  She can give us the exact date.
[02:09:00.541 --> 02:09:03.822]  And she went and ferreted out all the UN documents.
[02:09:03.822 --> 02:09:10.884]  She went and ferreted out their own admitted plans to disarm every man, woman, and child.
[02:09:10.884 --> 02:09:20.146]  Separately, we have other UN documents where they want to end the family, end our industrial society, and reduce our population forcibly.
[02:09:20.146 --> 02:09:21.726]  And now all that's on the news.
[02:09:22.932 --> 02:09:26.536]  So they went through a period in the 50s, 60s, and 70s kind of pushing it.
[02:09:26.536 --> 02:09:29.099]  Then they backed off and said, no, it doesn't exist.
[02:09:29.099 --> 02:09:32.522]  And then now they're back pushing it all and implementing a lot of it.
[02:09:32.522 --> 02:09:39.029]  And then I was in Aaron's office and saw this book that I've been meaning to cover, Future Government, Our Future World.
[02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:43.811]  And there's countless books like this that are in the public schools.
[02:09:43.811 --> 02:09:46.271]  And this is from the 80s.
[02:09:46.271 --> 02:09:50.293]  And it teaches kids that you'll have drones over your house watching you.
[02:09:50.293 --> 02:09:54.555]  You'll all live in communal government housing that's good for the earth.
[02:09:54.555 --> 02:09:56.135]  Everything you do will be surveilled.
[02:09:56.135 --> 02:10:01.717]  You'll talk to people via televisions instead of phones so you won't have to travel.
[02:10:01.717 --> 02:10:03.738]  World government will run everything.
[02:10:03.738 --> 02:10:05.019]  It actually says world government.
[02:10:06.259 --> 02:10:10.080]  War will never happen anymore because everyone will live in big bubble cities.
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:13.081]  And, of course, population will be controlled.
[02:10:13.081 --> 02:10:14.481]  Future weapons.
[02:10:14.481 --> 02:10:15.401]  That's a stealth bomber.
[02:10:15.401 --> 02:10:17.382]  This came out in 1980.
[02:10:17.382 --> 02:10:21.083]  But there's the loving stealth bomber before it was declassified.
[02:10:21.083 --> 02:10:24.763]  And war in space will keep us all safe with world government.
[02:10:24.763 --> 02:10:28.504]  Again, the New World, the planetary logo for world government.
[02:10:28.504 --> 02:10:29.425]  There that is right there.
[02:10:29.425 --> 02:10:31.905]  I'm going to do a whole piece on this soon.
[02:10:31.905 --> 02:10:35.086]  And then it breaks down how great the world government's going to be.
[02:10:36.621 --> 02:10:37.382]  I'm going from memory.
[02:10:37.382 --> 02:10:38.164]  This was published in 1980.
[02:10:38.164 --> 02:10:41.309]  Let me look it up.
[02:10:41.309 --> 02:10:42.551]  Let me see here.
[02:10:42.551 --> 02:10:44.895]  Where does it say it was published and when?
[02:10:47.202 --> 02:11:06.271]  Library of Congress catalog and publication data, Our Future World, discusses the idea of world government and the necessity for it in light of the present and future changes and the problems of our global community, international organization, juvenile literature, international, and it doesn't say the publication date.
[02:11:06.271 --> 02:11:08.071]  I thought I knew the publication of this.
[02:11:08.071 --> 02:11:11.193]  Yeah, I looked it up online.
[02:11:11.193 --> 02:11:13.614]  It's 1980 if I remember correctly.
[02:11:13.614 --> 02:11:15.095]  Normally they say the date on these.
[02:11:18.066 --> 02:11:21.253]  It says copyright 1980?
[02:11:21.253 --> 02:11:22.977]  I'm so flustered here, I can't even see it.
[02:11:22.977 --> 02:11:23.598]  Where does it say that?
[02:11:25.734 --> 02:11:27.295]  Oh, it's on the other side.
[02:11:27.295 --> 02:11:28.296]  Okay, I knew my memory was right.
[02:11:28.296 --> 02:11:28.736]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:28.736 --> 02:11:29.356]  Okay, copyright 1980.
[02:11:29.356 --> 02:11:31.858]  I looked at this at Bilderberg when somebody gave it to me.
[02:11:31.858 --> 02:11:32.859]  And I went and looked it up online.
[02:11:32.859 --> 02:11:34.540]  There's like dozens of these books.
[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:39.283]  And I remember this being in the elementary school library in Rockwall, Texas.
[02:11:39.283 --> 02:11:39.943]  That was weird.
[02:11:39.943 --> 02:11:44.987]  When the guy handed it to me, I said, wait, I've... And look, we're all on a spaceship, but we got to decide who's going to not live, though.
[02:11:44.987 --> 02:11:48.849]  There's only so many can live on this United World Federation.
[02:11:48.849 --> 02:11:50.130]  Oh, look, it's so much fun.
[02:11:52.116 --> 02:11:54.578]  And then they've got all the other ones here.
[02:11:54.578 --> 02:11:55.999]  Going back to Bernadine Smith.
[02:11:55.999 --> 02:12:00.942]  Bernadine Smith, I mean, it's wild to know these technocrats have come up with our future.
[02:12:00.942 --> 02:12:02.384]  They're implementing it.
[02:12:02.384 --> 02:12:04.905]  It doesn't matter if people are against abortion.
[02:12:04.905 --> 02:12:08.288]  It doesn't matter if we're against same-sex marriage.
[02:12:08.288 --> 02:12:10.870]  It doesn't matter if we don't want to turn our guns in.
[02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:14.712]  It doesn't matter if we don't want all, you know, to have the NSA spying on us.
[02:12:14.712 --> 02:12:16.654]  The system is just going ahead with it.
[02:12:18.288 --> 02:12:23.709]  It's true, and it's the same with demanding that you surrender your guns.
[02:12:23.709 --> 02:12:36.932]  They don't care what you think, but like I said, it's going to lead to a civil war because the people have never given their permission, and the federal government is lying about that.
[02:12:36.932 --> 02:12:44.513]  The Bill of Rights, as you know, is not subject to repeal, revoke, or rescinding process.
[02:12:48.519 --> 02:12:49.419]  I don't know.
[02:13:07.865 --> 02:13:14.851]  We could defuse the Civil War if we do bring this out because the Civil War is going to be fought over guns.
[02:13:14.851 --> 02:13:15.832]  That's what they're going to do.
[02:13:15.832 --> 02:13:36.589]  They're going to come in and they're going to kill people if they don't submit to letting their house be searched or, you know, they take all the information from the sales that are made by gun stores and they pretty much know, you know, gun clubs and they know who to start with.
[02:13:37.129 --> 02:13:41.651]  And that will frighten and terrorize the rest of the population.
[02:13:41.651 --> 02:13:44.392]  And Martinine, let me expand on what you were saying last hour.
[02:13:44.392 --> 02:13:52.396]  People are waking up, I mean even Time Magazine has to admit it, so we've got a chance to turn this around if people realize we've been occupied.
[02:13:52.396 --> 02:13:58.659]  Our government is run at the bureaucratic level by people that are part of this globalist cult.
[02:13:59.139 --> 02:14:07.803]  You don't get in unless you're part of it, and it's not to bring peace, it is to bring absolute bondage and enslavement in their own words.
[02:14:07.803 --> 02:14:24.771]  That's what's so sickening about this, and they admit that when they stage the crises and order the police and military to go out and get the guns, that it will cause a civil war, they're going to call us all terrorists, it will decimate the police and military, and then in all these documents we just showed,
[02:14:25.311 --> 02:14:27.692]  Then they bring in the foreign troops.
[02:14:27.692 --> 02:14:32.535]  They want Americans to kill each other first, then they come in.
[02:14:32.535 --> 02:14:35.016]  We've got to reach out to police and military.
[02:14:35.016 --> 02:14:45.881]  And Bernadine, I have been sent classified documents by Army, the Army then admitted three months ago it was real and responded saying it was classified, on re-education camps for Americans.
[02:14:45.881 --> 02:14:54.205]  I was then sent a document that was public, but it was tipped off to, where they have gun confiscation training in the military now.
[02:14:54.465 --> 02:14:57.627]  They will have resistance, of course, but they will kill a lot of people.
[02:15:19.372 --> 02:15:20.133]  Are you there?
[02:15:20.133 --> 02:15:22.116]  Yeah, no, no, I'm here listening to you.
[02:15:22.116 --> 02:15:26.803]  Yeah, they will kill a lot of people if they resist.
[02:15:26.803 --> 02:15:30.268]  Do you know how many police and military are going to get killed?
[02:15:30.268 --> 02:15:30.989]  Pardon?
[02:15:30.989 --> 02:15:33.572]  Well, they won't be working with our military.
[02:15:33.572 --> 02:15:35.175]  They'll be working with foreign troops.
[02:15:36.344 --> 02:15:41.825]  And they'll have them come in and go house to house and search properties.
[02:15:41.825 --> 02:15:44.686]  Now that's, Bernadine Igress, I disagree with you on that.
[02:15:44.686 --> 02:15:46.007]  That's phase two.
[02:15:46.007 --> 02:15:47.887]  Our troops are now under NATO-UN.
[02:15:47.887 --> 02:15:48.847]  They are the foreign troops.
[02:15:48.847 --> 02:16:02.711]  Even though they're good... Yeah, but they'll be bringing people that are from other countries because American boys will catch on too quick and they will not go into their relatives' homes or
[02:16:03.551 --> 02:16:06.053]  I don't think that the majority will be happy about it.
[02:16:06.053 --> 02:16:07.614]  I think they will be replaced by foreign troops.
[02:16:07.614 --> 02:16:08.195]  It won't be our boys.
[02:16:29.164 --> 02:16:32.146]  By the way, that's all official.
[02:16:32.146 --> 02:16:38.291]  We've been to a bunch of urban warfare drills where they have foreign troops trying to take our guns and admitting it.
[02:16:46.957 --> 02:16:51.481]  But I mean, let me tell you, that's just an invitation to civil war right there.
[02:16:51.481 --> 02:16:54.363]  But these globalists are just crazy enough to do it.
[02:16:54.363 --> 02:16:57.606]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Florida.
[02:16:57.606 --> 02:17:02.670]  You're on the air with Bernadine Smith, legend when it comes to defending the Second Amendment.
[02:17:02.670 --> 02:17:04.551]  Hey, how you doing, Bernadine?
[02:17:04.551 --> 02:17:06.333]  Oh, just fine, thank you.
[02:17:06.333 --> 02:17:07.393]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:17:07.393 --> 02:17:08.414]  Alright.
[02:17:08.414 --> 02:17:10.156]  Alright, I got two points.
[02:17:10.156 --> 02:17:11.417]  First of all, I want to say,
[02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:20.187]  When they do false flags and stuff, I wanted to make it a slang that that's a 9-11, because everybody knows at this point that it was fake.
[02:17:22.256 --> 02:17:23.717]  So it's like a police call letter.
[02:17:23.717 --> 02:17:25.839]  We got a 9-11 going on here.
[02:17:25.839 --> 02:17:26.939]  Yeah.
[02:17:26.939 --> 02:17:37.167]  And another thing I wanted to ask, since they're making rules for us that we wouldn't consent to, when do you think they're getting rid of the Constitution?
[02:17:37.167 --> 02:17:38.548]  Because it's obviously in their way.
[02:17:38.548 --> 02:17:41.650]  They're pulling things like this gun treaty.
[02:17:41.650 --> 02:17:42.851]  They're getting rid of it.
[02:17:42.851 --> 02:17:45.053]  Well, they already passed government control of health care.
[02:17:45.053 --> 02:17:46.654]  I mean, it's late in the game here.
[02:17:47.984 --> 02:17:59.955]  Yeah, because for every disaster they have, they ignore the Constitution, and it seems like your rights don't apply unless the court acknowledges your rights.
[02:17:59.955 --> 02:18:05.120]  Well, like I said, actually the Constitution is not the news.
[02:18:06.033 --> 02:18:08.475]  Because we have the Homeland Security.
[02:18:08.475 --> 02:18:10.196]  That is a dictatorship.
[02:18:10.196 --> 02:18:14.819]  I've been saying that for... Oh yeah, it's... We are under a dictatorship.
[02:18:14.819 --> 02:18:16.320]  No, no, we are under martial law.
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:17.781]  It's just an increment of it.
[02:18:17.781 --> 02:18:24.325]  It is there to absorb the old republic.
[02:18:24.325 --> 02:18:28.728]  Who in the Congress will stand up and protest what's happened?
[02:18:29.794 --> 02:18:32.135]  This is where we're failing.
[02:18:32.135 --> 02:18:44.399]  I don't know how we're going to get other people to replace some of these people that are our world leaders in the Senate.
[02:18:44.399 --> 02:18:46.440]  There's only 51 people that are opposing
[02:18:52.649 --> 02:18:59.393]  I really don't have all the answers of how we're going to stop it but I know it has to be stopped.
[02:19:10.546 --> 02:19:19.190]  Yeah, we're going to have to go to break here, Bernadine, and come back with a few final calls for you, but I want listeners to really have it hit them, the magnitude of this.
[02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:32.716]  We are occupied now by a foreign banking world government that is so arrogant and so sure of itself, it's telling us this now on the news, while the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center, foreign agents,
[02:19:33.576 --> 02:19:40.098]  Openly say we're insane and traitors and need to be arrested for saying there's a world government that's illegitimate.
[02:19:40.098 --> 02:19:41.779]  I mean, we are occupied.
[02:19:41.779 --> 02:19:43.719]  And now they're putting in the internet kill switches.
[02:19:43.719 --> 02:19:46.140]  They're getting ready to shut down talk radio.
[02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:49.801]  They're getting ready to start wars and false flags as a way to sell it.
[02:19:49.801 --> 02:19:53.002]  When I come back, I'll give you Bernadine Smith's website as well.
[02:19:53.002 --> 02:19:53.923]  Go there.
[02:19:53.923 --> 02:19:55.443]  Get the PDFs off there.
[02:19:55.443 --> 02:20:00.385]  We're going to mirror them at InfoWars.com and do a special report on this in the next few days.
[02:20:01.005 --> 02:20:07.152]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:20:07.152 --> 02:20:10.115]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:20:10.115 --> 02:20:15.502]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:20:15.502 --> 02:20:20.187]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:20:20.467 --> 02:20:28.115]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:20:28.115 --> 02:20:31.980]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:20:31.980 --> 02:20:33.782]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:20:33.782 --> 02:20:37.786]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:20:37.786 --> 02:20:40.409]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:20:40.689 --> 02:20:43.471]  The fact is, you can eat it any time to save money today.
[02:20:43.471 --> 02:20:48.013]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[02:20:48.013 --> 02:20:48.673]  Don't wait!

[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:05.523]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:07.624]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:21:08.551 --> 02:21:17.515]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:21:17.515 --> 02:21:22.437]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:22:06.681 --> 02:22:11.206]  The key is to maintain healthy testosterone levels, and now there's a way you can do it naturally.
[02:22:11.206 --> 02:22:12.127]  Here's the secret.
[02:22:12.127 --> 02:22:13.529]  It's all about Tgen.
[02:22:13.529 --> 02:22:18.314]  Tgen is an all-natural formula that contains ingredients proven to boost your own testosterone.
[02:22:18.314 --> 02:22:23.640]  Not only that, but these ingredients were shown to increase your sexual desire, enhance muscle growth with exercise,
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:24.260]  I think so.
[02:22:47.381 --> 02:22:53.025]  In a study of exercising men using the ingredient in TGen, a majority reported an improvement in sexual desire.
[02:22:53.025 --> 02:22:53.505]  Don't wait!

[02:24:14.290 --> 02:24:17.593]  Bernadine said something really important last hour.
[02:24:17.593 --> 02:24:22.757]  This is a global government, and they say they're good guys, but they're not.
[02:24:22.757 --> 02:24:29.524]  And if you study what the financial interests that run the UN are up to and what they do, I mean, they say they want you poor.
[02:24:29.524 --> 02:24:32.006]  They say they want you to not be able to have children.
[02:24:32.006 --> 02:24:34.108]  They say that
[02:24:35.185 --> 02:24:38.167]  Well, Prince Charles doesn't want you to be able to take a hot bath.
[02:24:38.167 --> 02:24:42.830]  But then he's got hundreds of palaces and aircraft and private trains.
[02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:45.631]  He actually told people, don't take hot baths this winter.
[02:24:45.631 --> 02:24:47.933]  It takes too much gas to heat the water.
[02:24:49.431 --> 02:24:56.975]  I mean, this is just like this instinct of these pigs to dominate us and block our development so they can control us.
[02:24:56.975 --> 02:25:00.077]  And then I've got all the white papers where it's stated.
[02:25:00.077 --> 02:25:06.320]  And then they sit there and tell us how they care about us and, oh, turn your guns and we want to take care of you.
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:10.822]  No, they want to be able to shut down any business they want, like Chick-fil-A in Chicago.
[02:25:10.822 --> 02:25:14.003]  They want to run our lives.
[02:25:14.003 --> 02:25:14.844]  Let's take another call.
[02:25:14.844 --> 02:25:16.825]  John in Texas, you're on with Bernadine Smith.
[02:25:18.191 --> 02:25:19.132]  Hi Alex.
[02:25:19.132 --> 02:25:19.392]  Hey buddy.
[02:25:19.392 --> 02:25:21.153]  Hi Bernardine.
[02:25:21.153 --> 02:25:33.439]  Bernardine, do you think, you talk about the Civil War, do you think this is going to be a Civil War like they had in Spain in 1937 where the nationalists are fighting against the globalist, communist, internationalist?
[02:25:33.439 --> 02:25:34.480]  Probably.
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:36.301]  Probably even worse.
[02:25:36.301 --> 02:25:45.586]  You know, we're larger and our country's population is greater.
[02:25:45.586 --> 02:25:47.027]  It will be a disaster.
[02:25:48.463 --> 02:26:02.908]  And the main thing that I wanted to get on, and the point I wanted to get over, is that there never was any permission to break the Second Amendment.
[02:26:02.908 --> 02:26:06.069]  The people have never approved of it.
[02:26:06.069 --> 02:26:08.550]  It has been falsified.
[02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:16.973]  And that point has to be brought to our Congress, and like I said, hopefully we can get Rand Paul to lead in that.
[02:26:17.663 --> 02:26:27.946]  If not, then gun clubs all over the country should be letting the people know that that's the predicament that we're in.
[02:26:27.946 --> 02:26:28.867]  Oh yeah!
[02:26:28.867 --> 02:26:39.510]  We're going to be stripped of our only defense, our only ability to fight against world communism.
[02:26:40.269 --> 02:26:55.932]  And, um, I would suggest that people go to my website and look under the category called Gun Prohibition and see the article that, uh, it's a 75-page, uh, report.
[02:26:55.932 --> 02:27:05.434]  Starts out, I call it, fabrication or a falsification of the people's approval for the prohibition of the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:27:05.434 --> 02:27:09.715]  And start from there, and if that word can get around,
[02:27:10.758 --> 02:27:15.260]  It will open up many of these subjects that you're talking about.
[02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:22.542]  Well, I totally agree with you because the average gun shop or gun range does nothing and just lays there as if that's going to keep them safe.
[02:27:22.542 --> 02:27:24.823]  And they go, I don't want the ATF to get mad at me.
[02:27:24.823 --> 02:27:26.203]  They're your servants.
[02:27:26.203 --> 02:27:27.664]  Get in their face.
[02:27:27.664 --> 02:27:29.184]  They're doing things that are illegal.
[02:27:29.184 --> 02:27:31.065]  They're shipping guns to Mexico.
[02:27:31.065 --> 02:27:33.946]  Stop laying down like sheep to these wolves.
[02:27:33.946 --> 02:27:35.046]  Thank you, John.
[02:27:35.046 --> 02:27:36.746]  Let's talk to Jason in California.
[02:27:36.746 --> 02:27:38.187]  You're on the air with Bernadine Smith.
[02:27:39.229 --> 02:27:42.091]  Hey Alex and Bernadine, long time listener.
[02:27:42.091 --> 02:27:44.513]  I just got a couple points and then a question.
[02:27:44.513 --> 02:27:47.876]  I mean, we knew that this was happening.
[02:27:48.827 --> 02:27:49.567]  Long ago.
[02:27:49.567 --> 02:27:51.548]  We knew that the false flag was coming.
[02:27:51.548 --> 02:27:57.590]  We saw the Department of Homeland Security with their videos saying, look out for white terrorists.
[02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:59.430]  Look out for homegrown terrorists.
[02:27:59.430 --> 02:28:00.411]  Look out.
[02:28:00.411 --> 02:28:01.371]  And you know what?
[02:28:01.371 --> 02:28:02.851]  It's been right under our nose.
[02:28:02.851 --> 02:28:08.913]  We knew it was coming and look, now we have one of the worst false flags in American history.
[02:28:08.913 --> 02:28:12.714]  Not because of the casualties, but because of what it's going to do to us.
[02:28:12.714 --> 02:28:15.135]  This is going to take our Second Amendment away.
[02:28:15.999 --> 02:28:23.807]  And we need full spectrum civil disobedience because we as the American people cannot let this happen.
[02:28:23.807 --> 02:28:24.388]  Exactly.
[02:28:24.388 --> 02:28:35.899]  Before the Civil War starts and the cities collapse and hundreds of thousands of police and citizens are killed, we have got to come together now and say, no, don't stage terror attacks.
[02:28:35.899 --> 02:28:37.240]  Don't blame it on us.
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:39.543]  And don't do it because it is pointless.
[02:28:39.983 --> 02:28:40.603]  Oh, it's quite a while.
[02:29:01.061 --> 02:29:12.915]  But the fact is that the people have never given their permission and that has to be brought out.
[02:29:12.915 --> 02:29:16.419]  I just hope that they will.
[02:29:19.887 --> 02:29:24.429]  Realize that they've got to complain now before a war starts.
[02:29:24.429 --> 02:29:24.929]  That's right.
[02:29:24.929 --> 02:29:26.330]  A war is inevitable.
[02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:28.131]  A war is going to come.
[02:29:28.131 --> 02:29:31.992]  Because they're going to go after the people's guns.
[02:29:31.992 --> 02:29:34.753]  That's the only way that they can protect themselves.
[02:29:34.753 --> 02:29:36.794]  And they're going to try to take them.
[02:29:36.794 --> 02:29:37.335]  That's right.
[02:29:37.335 --> 02:29:39.575]  The globalists have taken over the government.
[02:29:39.575 --> 02:29:41.636]  Now they want us individually enslaved.
[02:29:41.636 --> 02:29:43.517]  This is Hardcore Burning Smith.
[02:29:43.517 --> 02:29:44.738]  LibertyGunRights.com.
[02:29:44.738 --> 02:29:45.678]  We salute you.
[02:29:45.678 --> 02:29:47.039]  We'll be back with more key intel.
[02:29:47.039 --> 02:29:47.439]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.253 --> 02:29:53.237]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.237 --> 02:29:56.842]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.047 --> 02:30:11.154]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[02:30:11.154 --> 02:30:15.237]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:30:15.237 --> 02:30:22.544]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[02:30:22.544 --> 02:30:25.026]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:30:25.566 --> 02:30:30.409]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:30:30.409 --> 02:30:36.333]  Buy the 1 to 2 month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:36.333 --> 02:30:41.757]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[02:30:41.757 --> 02:30:43.739]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:30:43.739 --> 02:30:48.962]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:30:48.962 --> 02:30:51.144]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:30:52.004 --> 02:31:00.650]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:31:00.650 --> 02:31:07.174]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:31:07.174 --> 02:31:09.775]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:31:09.775 --> 02:31:15.159]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:31:15.159 --> 02:31:18.421]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[02:31:18.601 --> 02:31:20.122]  Blowing up your food prices.
[02:31:20.122 --> 02:31:27.766]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[02:31:27.766 --> 02:31:31.628]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:31:31.628 --> 02:31:33.429]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:31:33.429 --> 02:31:37.431]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[02:31:37.431 --> 02:31:40.053]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:31:40.333 --> 02:31:43.115]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:31:43.115 --> 02:31:47.679]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:31:47.679 --> 02:31:48.340]  Don't wait!
[02:31:48.340 --> 02:31:49.821]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[02:31:49.821 --> 02:31:51.803]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[02:31:51.803 --> 02:31:53.344]  You can bet your life on efoods direct.
[02:32:00.430 --> 02:32:04.971]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.971 --> 02:32:05.892]  Number one.
[02:32:05.892 --> 02:32:09.313]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.313 --> 02:32:10.173]  Number two.
[02:32:10.173 --> 02:32:15.055]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.055 --> 02:32:15.795]  It's true.
[02:32:15.795 --> 02:32:20.676]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.676 --> 02:32:21.497]  Number three.
[02:32:21.497 --> 02:32:25.078]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.078 --> 02:32:28.779]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.999 --> 02:32:29.800]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:32.543]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.543 --> 02:32:36.227]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.227 --> 02:32:37.028]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.028 --> 02:32:41.173]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.173 --> 02:32:45.938]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.218 --> 02:32:50.380]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.380 --> 02:32:52.180]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:54.421]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:54.421 --> 02:32:56.762]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:01.165 --> 02:33:03.326]  I've been everywhere, man.
[02:33:03.326 --> 02:33:05.228]  I've been everywhere, man.
[02:33:05.228 --> 02:33:07.409]  Across the desert, there, man.
[02:33:07.409 --> 02:33:09.290]  I breathe the mountain air, man.
[02:33:09.290 --> 02:33:11.852]  I travel like I had my share, man.
[02:33:11.852 --> 02:33:13.413]  I've been everywhere.
[02:33:13.413 --> 02:33:27.301]  I've been to Reno, Chicago, Fargo, Minnesota, Buffalo, Toronto, Winslow, Sarasota, Wichita, Tulsa, Ottawa, Oklahoma, Tampa, Panama, Mattawa, La Paloma, Bangor, Baltimore, El Salvador, Amarillo, Tocopelo, Barranquilla, and Padilla.
[02:33:27.301 --> 02:33:28.282]  I'm a killer.
[02:33:28.282 --> 02:33:29.002]  I've been everywhere.
[02:33:29.323 --> 02:33:30.765]  We're good to go.
[02:33:42.412 --> 02:33:52.396]  I'm also back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:52.396 --> 02:34:11.383]  with a live transmission weeknights 7 o'clock myself and the rest of the crew to the InfoWars Nightly News and again I get in here every day now and I'm at home and I'm researching news and I get in here and I cover a lot of it but I I tend to get so wound up by the time I even get on air I don't even know what to do
[02:34:12.702 --> 02:34:16.124]  I mean, it's just we've got total criminals overrunning us.
[02:34:16.124 --> 02:34:18.085]  Half the public's in a coma, literal.
[02:34:18.085 --> 02:34:24.508]  I mean, medical trance with the TV and the chemicals.
[02:34:24.508 --> 02:34:30.191]  The globalists are so evil and do so many horrible things that I'm in awe of that.
[02:34:31.323 --> 02:34:35.868]  It's kind of like John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos and it says he marveled at the beast.
[02:34:35.868 --> 02:34:36.709]  I mean, I marvel.
[02:34:36.709 --> 02:34:37.369]  It's like, what?
[02:34:37.369 --> 02:34:39.952]  I mean, why do they do this?
[02:34:39.952 --> 02:34:40.973]  Why are they?
[02:34:40.973 --> 02:34:43.216]  Well, they hate goodness.
[02:34:43.216 --> 02:34:45.278]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:34:47.771 --> 02:34:54.156]  It's kind of like Ted Knight says in Caddyshack, Danny, there's goodness and badness.
[02:34:54.156 --> 02:34:57.459]  Danny says, I want to be good, and he goes, good, very good.
[02:34:57.459 --> 02:35:01.083]  All right, I'm doing a stupid Caddyshack joke now.
[02:35:01.083 --> 02:35:05.787]  The point is, I know why people pull back into their shells and just give up.
[02:35:07.079 --> 02:35:10.020]  Because it's so overwhelming, but you cannot do that.
[02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:11.541]  And we're close to beating them.
[02:35:11.541 --> 02:35:15.362]  I mean, I keep going back to this Time Magazine cover, and the polls show it.
[02:35:15.362 --> 02:35:19.304]  In the 60s, they convinced about half the public to turn their guns in, and it was a good thing to do.
[02:35:19.304 --> 02:35:26.147]  Because it was the new, you know, uppity thing, and the government could be trusted, and we were all going to fly around in silver spacesuits, and it was all going to be great.
[02:35:26.687 --> 02:35:29.692]  Now, on most polls, it's over 70%.
[02:35:29.692 --> 02:35:32.617]  Scientific polls are just totally pro-gun.
[02:35:32.617 --> 02:35:34.019]  They don't want any restrictions.
[02:35:34.019 --> 02:35:37.465]  They say, let felons have them, just as long as I got mine.
[02:35:37.465 --> 02:35:39.629]  They get that we have a predatory government.
[02:35:40.868 --> 02:35:54.297]  They get that it's, I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'm blown away that the big banks publicly run Al-Qaeda and publicly run all the drugs and publicly run the aircraft and publicly they're putting Al-Qaeda into Syria and admitting it now.
[02:35:54.297 --> 02:35:56.919]  And it just came out, of course, Obama ordered it all.
[02:35:58.059 --> 02:36:01.281]  I mean, it's just so still over the top.
[02:36:01.281 --> 02:36:03.581]  It's over the top that Harvard even came out.
[02:36:03.581 --> 02:36:16.907]  I mean, we already knew this, but Harvard comes out and says, we've gone over all these studies in our own study and fluoride in the water is brain damaging us and destroying America and causing us to be stupid and we can't compete.
[02:36:16.907 --> 02:36:22.549]  Folks, the people running Harvard are the ones back in the 30s and 40s that put the fluoride in in the 50s.
[02:36:22.549 --> 02:36:23.610]  I've got those documents.
[02:36:24.278 --> 02:36:31.780]  I mean, what type of world is it where they put it in the water and then they tell us they did it to us, but then it stays in the water?
[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:36.601]  I mean, it's all just over the top.
[02:36:36.601 --> 02:36:37.721]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:36:37.721 --> 02:36:40.262]  I don't feel worthy to even bring you this info.
[02:36:40.262 --> 02:36:42.042]  There's so much of it.
[02:36:42.042 --> 02:36:45.983]  It's so crazy that I just beg of you.
[02:36:45.983 --> 02:36:48.744]  I beg of you, because you are the answer.
[02:36:49.741 --> 02:36:58.266]  To research this, find out it's true, and then grab your preacher by the arm and say, stop preaching Romans 13 out of context, we gotta do something.
[02:36:58.266 --> 02:37:10.492]  And you see a cop, pull over and talk to him, give him films, give him info, say, listen buddy, you're an American too, you better, this is the kind of stuff where we should be running around, well, like Alex Jones.
[02:37:10.492 --> 02:37:15.395]  People ask why I'm the biggest alternative media in the world, which I'm not proud of, that's scary.
[02:37:15.395 --> 02:37:18.377]  I feel like I'm not doing a good enough job with this position God's put me in.
[02:37:18.979 --> 02:37:23.424]  It's because I will get excited, I will run around like a chicken with my head cut off.
[02:37:23.424 --> 02:37:26.948]  Which is a normal response to being taken over and conquered.
[02:37:26.948 --> 02:37:32.475]  Now let me tell you, we got a fella here who helped us get Charlie Daniels on the show, a great patriot, who's really waking up.
[02:37:33.744 --> 02:37:37.726]  Chuck Undersea is a retired Army officer.
[02:37:37.726 --> 02:37:41.428]  Lives pretty much an Amish lifestyle out in Fredericksburg.
[02:37:41.428 --> 02:37:42.449]  Great guy.
[02:37:42.449 --> 02:37:44.730]  He and his wife got a chance to meet him.
[02:37:44.730 --> 02:37:50.953]  And they have produced Behold the Pale Horse, America's Last Chance, starring country music legend Charlie Daniels.
[02:37:50.953 --> 02:37:54.115]  It's available at InfoWarshop.com.
[02:37:54.115 --> 02:37:55.616]  Amazing cinematography.
[02:37:55.616 --> 02:37:56.296]  Incredible.
[02:37:58.217 --> 02:37:58.537]  We're good.
[02:38:28.456 --> 02:38:29.277]  Get sponsors.
[02:38:29.277 --> 02:38:30.718]  Pay for it if you have to.
[02:38:30.718 --> 02:38:32.699]  Free market.
[02:38:32.699 --> 02:38:34.060]  Make money from it.
[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:35.401]  Get a three hour show.
[02:38:35.401 --> 02:38:36.842]  Then next you'll have a weekday show.
[02:38:36.842 --> 02:38:38.944]  You'll get paid to be on the radio.
[02:38:38.944 --> 02:38:40.685]  You've just got to resist.
[02:38:40.685 --> 02:38:41.866]  Resistance is victory.
[02:38:44.249 --> 02:38:45.910]  Chuck Hunter sees an example of this.
[02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:48.592]  Behold the Pale Horse, available at Infowarshop.com.
[02:38:48.592 --> 02:38:50.554]  You support us, we support them.
[02:38:50.554 --> 02:38:52.495]  Get it, show it to everybody you know.
[02:38:52.495 --> 02:38:54.236]  Powerful new film.
[02:38:54.236 --> 02:39:00.260]  It was perfect to have Bernadine Smith on, on the UN agenda to disarm us, world government.
[02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:03.623]  And then it's great to have him in here with the rest of the New World Order agenda.
[02:39:03.623 --> 02:39:07.786]  Chuck, what do you think of what's happening in this world and how crazy things have gotten?
[02:39:09.238 --> 02:39:17.927]  Well, Alex, first let me say your passion for freedom is infectious and has the power to move mountains, so I deeply appreciate your interest in our film.
[02:39:17.927 --> 02:39:23.592]  And I guess the single word that comes to mind as to your question is domination.
[02:39:23.592 --> 02:39:31.700]  And I suppose I never fit that well as a military type because I didn't like people telling me what to do.
[02:39:34.344 --> 02:39:51.610]  My wife and I, I guess, are sort of the perfect target audience for the film, because we're just regular people clinging to Bible and Gun, and we wanted to do something that would be... You know, when I first got to L.A., we were out there 22 years, and an old producer told me, do what you know.
[02:39:51.610 --> 02:39:58.693]  So that's what we decided to do, to bring something to the party, as far as on our end.
[02:39:58.693 --> 02:40:00.594]  And this three-year odyssey has
[02:40:03.911 --> 02:40:09.137]  It's a trilogy, the film's a trilogy, and we have part two and three being edited right now.
[02:40:10.251 --> 02:40:17.016]  It's been a project, and the more, as you know, the more you peel away the layers, the bigger it gets.
[02:40:17.016 --> 02:40:23.681]  We started out with a one-year project and maybe eight or ten people to interview, and it grew to 42 people.
[02:40:23.681 --> 02:40:27.183]  Yeah, tell folks, some of the people that are in the film.
[02:40:27.183 --> 02:40:30.626]  I mean, Gerald Salente, this is a who's who.
[02:40:30.626 --> 02:40:37.771]  It's amazing how you travel the country on a shoestring to do this, and it just looks like a million bucks.
[02:40:39.065 --> 02:40:53.028]  Well, in part one we lead off about communist insurgency and where that's taking us in this country with Lieutenant General William Boykin, who many people may be familiar with.
[02:40:53.028 --> 02:40:58.689]  He was the commander of Mogadishu in the incident which later became known as Black Hawk Down, the movie.
[02:40:58.689 --> 02:41:04.370]  But he had an amazing military career, a founding member of Delta Force, a commander of special forces.
[02:41:05.208 --> 02:41:08.010]  Captured Noriega, I mean, just on and on.
[02:41:08.010 --> 02:41:27.807]  And so he starts out and is intercut throughout with Gerald Talenti, this is part one, Larry Pratt, Edwin Vieira, Joan Bion, Michael Shaw, Dr. Albrecht, Katherine Albrecht, Jim Mars, Dr. Stan, Joel Skousen, Butch Pa, Michael Badnari.
[02:41:30.703 --> 02:41:36.968]  It's funny because when you go to film these people, first of all, the object of the game is to find a celebrity.
[02:41:36.968 --> 02:41:49.439]  I did commercials in LA, we were out there 22 years, to find a celebrity because, to interweave the story, because the American people are, you know, unfortunately commercially trained to listen to celebrities.
[02:41:49.439 --> 02:41:52.882]  So I knew from being in commercials that if we could find someone that would
[02:41:53.874 --> 02:42:06.456]  Perhaps carry the day, and I can tell you it's not easy to find celebrities today who aren't looking over their shoulders on these issues, so I just was thrilled.
[02:42:06.456 --> 02:42:09.977]  It's hard to find people that aren't cowards, is what you mean.
[02:42:09.977 --> 02:42:12.017]  Yeah, to put it more succinctly.
[02:42:12.017 --> 02:42:20.139]  So I was thrilled when we got Charlie, and I had followed his blog or his soapbox on his charliedaniels.com site.
[02:42:20.658 --> 02:42:21.638]  And he's on it.
[02:42:21.638 --> 02:42:26.160]  And so, the funny story is, it still took me a long time to get in touch with him.
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:37.324]  And finally, his manager called and said, you know, I don't think Charlie would do this because he has a stroke and he's just not doing a lot of things besides his music right now.
[02:42:37.324 --> 02:42:38.785]  But this is the kind of thing he likes.
[02:42:38.785 --> 02:42:39.705]  I'm going to give him the script.
[02:42:39.705 --> 02:42:43.686]  Two days later, Charlie called me and said, I'm going to be in San Antonio next week.
[02:42:43.686 --> 02:42:45.007]  I want to meet with you.
[02:42:45.007 --> 02:42:45.467]  So he did.
[02:42:45.467 --> 02:42:46.828]  I met him in a hotel.
[02:42:46.828 --> 02:42:47.448]  My wife went.
[02:42:48.772 --> 02:42:54.776]  And we went over points of the script and of course mostly his part was scripted.
[02:42:54.776 --> 02:42:56.937]  And he said, I want to see you in Nashville in a week.
[02:42:56.937 --> 02:42:59.238]  So we were there and the rest is history.
[02:42:59.238 --> 02:43:02.340]  Well he does a great job and this film deserves to be seen.
[02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:04.602]  Behold the Pale Horse, America's Last Chance.
[02:43:05.262 --> 02:43:07.003]  Just a who's who.
[02:43:07.003 --> 02:43:11.145]  Tell us about the fella that he's in a lot of big movies and stuff.
[02:43:11.145 --> 02:43:14.726]  You've also got, I mean, this has got actors, you've got the Alamo in it.
[02:43:14.726 --> 02:43:17.888]  I don't know how you did this on the budget you had.
[02:43:17.888 --> 02:43:23.070]  You've got the fella that plays George Washington playing George Washington with quotes.
[02:43:23.070 --> 02:43:24.971]  I mean, it's really neat.
[02:43:24.971 --> 02:43:27.492]  This is something, too, that's really family-oriented.
[02:43:27.492 --> 02:43:29.973]  You can show homeschoolers this, churches.
[02:43:29.973 --> 02:43:33.755]  I mean, this is, it's hardcore, but it's smooth at the same time.
[02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:53.284]  Well, we've all got friends and family who glazed over the first thought of any of these issues, me included, and I wanted to have a primer, a tool to give people and start Part 1 off in a more easy mode.
[02:43:53.284 --> 02:43:55.105]  Part 2 and Part 3 were ramped up.
[02:43:56.374 --> 02:44:02.016]  But I wanted to get them started easily, and we've had a good response from that.
[02:44:02.016 --> 02:44:23.003]  But generally speaking, we went, luckily, in Dripping Springs with the movie set for the most recent film of the Alamo, and I knew the bottom line to me was that we, all Americans, and people of the world, in fact, have to draw our own line in the sand, as Travis did.
[02:44:23.536 --> 02:44:38.422]  So, I wanted this to have theatrical interest, and not just be your normal documentary, but have interviews intermixed with historical reenactments like Washington Crossing the Delaware, which will be shot near Valley Forge.
[02:44:38.422 --> 02:44:42.784]  But at the Alamo, we got, amazingly, a lot of the people that were actually in the movie,
[02:44:43.430 --> 02:44:43.950]  I don't know.
[02:44:57.427 --> 02:45:04.010]  After that scene, General Boykin comes back and says, we were all born for such a time as this.
[02:45:04.010 --> 02:45:07.431]  We have to put on the armor of God and we were all born for such a time as this.
[02:45:07.431 --> 02:45:09.752]  There were many poignant moments.
[02:45:09.752 --> 02:45:15.514]  I said Charlie's part was scripted, but he really comes up with zingers periodically.
[02:45:15.514 --> 02:45:20.756]  He suddenly shouted when we were filming in Nashville in a log cabin in freezing weather.
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:25.763]  I'm not going to allow these scumbags to steal my country.
[02:45:25.763 --> 02:45:28.865]  I'm in this fight for the long term.
[02:45:28.865 --> 02:45:39.032]  And in a couple of points he was talking about what we're losing, like D-Day and various things he experienced as a child growing up in World War II.
[02:45:39.032 --> 02:45:40.713]  And he started crying.
[02:45:40.713 --> 02:45:42.094]  And it was all real.
[02:45:42.094 --> 02:45:43.415]  And that's the thing about him.
[02:45:43.415 --> 02:45:48.078]  He's the perfect Americana icon because he's just real.
[02:45:49.861 --> 02:46:01.816]  Well, watching the globalists try to wreck our families, try to brainwash our children, to even turn on mainline television now, it is so sick what they do.
[02:46:01.816 --> 02:46:04.579]  And adults are like, oh, it's no big deal.
[02:46:04.579 --> 02:46:05.660]  Yeah, because you're an adult.
[02:46:06.678 --> 02:46:08.539]  Little children are watching this.
[02:46:08.539 --> 02:46:10.300]  The stuff, again, they're putting in the water.
[02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:11.041]  All of it.
[02:46:11.041 --> 02:46:13.382]  These are just bad people.
[02:46:13.382 --> 02:46:15.183]  And they've got to be dealt with.
[02:46:15.183 --> 02:46:18.425]  And films like yours is a serious weapon.
[02:46:18.425 --> 02:46:20.167]  Now, you cover the waterfront.
[02:46:20.167 --> 02:46:22.928]  That's also what I like about Behold a Pale Horse.
[02:46:22.928 --> 02:46:27.211]  You get into so many different facets.
[02:46:27.211 --> 02:46:30.173]  Break down, basically, in general, what you cover.
[02:46:32.074 --> 02:46:33.995]  The central point is it's time to stand up.
[02:46:33.995 --> 02:46:34.896]  It's time to say no.
[02:46:34.896 --> 02:46:39.799]  It's time to draw the line in the sand and explain what the globalists are up to.
[02:46:39.799 --> 02:46:43.542]  But you also cover a whole host of issues for people.
[02:46:43.542 --> 02:46:47.925]  I just think you've hit a home run here, and that's why I'm very, very excited to be promoting it.
[02:46:47.925 --> 02:46:50.407]  Again, folks, it's Behold a Pale Horse, America's Last Chance.
[02:46:51.127 --> 02:46:56.553]  Uh, starring country music legend Charlie Daniels, but so many others available at Infowarshop.com.
[02:46:56.553 --> 02:47:10.468]  I hope you get it today, but, um, Chuck Undersea, uh, the director and creator of this with his wife that works so hard, uh, you kind of give us a program here, uh, break down some of the key points of the film Behold a Pale Horse.
[02:47:11.417 --> 02:47:16.859]  Well, again, carrying the theme of the story is woven in and out of the story of Charlie.
[02:47:16.859 --> 02:47:25.201]  And some of the main issues, there are a lot of sidebars, but generally it begins with General Boykin and the communist insurgency that we're facing.
[02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:26.322]  It's world communism.
[02:47:26.322 --> 02:47:28.942]  It really doesn't matter, as he says, what you call it.
[02:47:28.942 --> 02:47:31.783]  As you know, it's socialism, fascism, communism.
[02:47:31.783 --> 02:47:33.944]  It's just bad guys.
[02:47:33.944 --> 02:47:37.145]  It's a bunch of criminals that want to collectivize things.
[02:47:38.328 --> 02:47:57.980]  So he breaks that down, and I would say there's an intense focus on Agenda 21, Michael Kaufman and Michael Shaw and Dr. Stan Monteith, and the surveillance state, the nanny state, RFID, secret societies.
[02:47:57.980 --> 02:48:07.286]  It has a whole lot to do, you know, I pondered, I was just in turmoil for three, this has taken three years, I was in turmoil for three years about, it's easy to illustrate the
[02:48:08.024 --> 02:48:12.587]  The issue, the real issue, is difficult, is the solution.
[02:48:12.587 --> 02:48:19.713]  And, you know, it really just comes down to, I finally, it just, you know, came to me, and less is more.
[02:48:19.713 --> 02:48:22.915]  It was a simple answer, and that is two things.
[02:48:22.915 --> 02:48:32.963]  One, we have to, you know, we the people are a little short on government these days, and we the people have to wake up from an intellectual stupor.
[02:48:32.963 --> 02:48:34.544]  And if we can educate people
[02:48:35.891 --> 02:48:38.192]  As quickly as possible.
[02:48:38.192 --> 02:48:43.093]  That's the solution, coupled with wearing out your knees praying.
[02:48:43.093 --> 02:48:45.934]  Because, you know, it's a spiritual war.
[02:48:45.934 --> 02:49:01.579]  And Dr. Stanton, when we filmed him in Monterey Bay, said, you know, it's all so complex and so infinite and so all-encompassing that the human mind could not comprehend it or could not initiate it.
[02:49:01.579 --> 02:49:02.019]  And of course,
[02:49:02.998 --> 02:49:06.601]  That's one description, but it's just basically the answer.
[02:49:06.601 --> 02:49:07.782]  No, it's exactly.
[02:49:07.782 --> 02:49:14.607]  The deeper you get into this, you realize there really is a dark force, and it wants to kill everything on this planet.
[02:49:14.607 --> 02:49:17.589]  And the globalists are its instruments.
[02:49:17.589 --> 02:49:20.171]  They are just minions of this.
[02:49:20.171 --> 02:49:29.698]  You made a comment a minute ago about the church and the earlier guest, but in part two, we have Pastor Butch Paul, and he goes over the 5.1.C.3.
[02:49:29.698 --> 02:49:31.660]  It breaks it down, but he said
[02:49:32.694 --> 02:49:43.099]  You know, during the revolution, the pulpits were aflame with righteous indignation against the tyranny of the crown.
[02:49:43.099 --> 02:49:45.059]  And of course today, you don't hear that.
[02:49:45.059 --> 02:49:46.780]  You rarely hear that.
[02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:55.264]  And if the pulpits could be turned around to preach reality to the people, this would be over.
[02:49:55.891 --> 02:50:01.173]  And of course, by design, we have the 501c3, which muzzles the shirt.
[02:50:01.173 --> 02:50:11.517]  But we have something I'm really excited that's going to wind up on our website pretty soon, and that is we're hoping this will go viral from a grassroots level, but we're hoping to tutor people.
[02:50:11.517 --> 02:50:21.160]  We're offering on one of our pages to tutor people to make an event out of showing a Blu-ray in a local theater.
[02:50:22.137 --> 02:50:30.847]  And we will sell DVDs wholesale and just stimulate people to make an event out of it, have local Patriot speakers come.
[02:50:30.847 --> 02:50:36.293]  But there's nothing like the experience of seeing any film on the big screen compared to television.
[02:50:37.834 --> 02:50:47.643]  We showed the film in Fredericksburg and they sold out 200 seats and they had turned away 40 people and when it was over people stood and clapped and cheered and whistled.
[02:50:47.643 --> 02:50:55.970]  So I think that around the country people don't realize you can just go to a theater and usually it's $250, $300 and you can rent the theater.
[02:50:55.970 --> 02:50:56.871]  Exactly!
[02:50:56.871 --> 02:50:57.632]  Exactly!
[02:50:57.632 --> 02:50:58.473]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:58.473 --> 02:50:59.053]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.053 --> 02:51:00.534]  We're striking back against tyranny.
[02:51:01.235 --> 02:51:02.556]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:51:02.556 --> 02:51:08.142]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:51:08.142 --> 02:51:13.167]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:51:13.167 --> 02:51:18.732]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:51:18.732 --> 02:51:23.417]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:51:23.937 --> 02:51:31.059]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:51:31.059 --> 02:51:32.179]  And here's the best part.
[02:51:32.179 --> 02:51:38.861]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:51:38.861 --> 02:51:42.061]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:51:42.061 --> 02:51:45.222]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:51:45.222 --> 02:51:45.402]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:51:53.084 --> 02:51:57.917]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:51:57.917 --> 02:52:00.324]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com

[02:54:15.781 --> 02:54:25.928]  Don't forget this radio broadcast in the media system we're building over 45 people now here at the Infowars.com command center and growing.
[02:54:25.928 --> 02:54:28.289]  Got a new newspaper magazine coming out next month.

[02:54:49.924 --> 02:54:50.845]  We couldn't do it without you.
[02:54:50.845 --> 02:54:52.607]  We don't have the big globalist sponsorship.
[02:54:52.607 --> 02:54:57.851]  We don't take your tax money and make your bailouts and give it to MSNBC like the globalists do.
[02:54:57.851 --> 02:55:01.434]  We have Mike Hanson's book back in print, Cult of Conspiracy.
[02:55:01.434 --> 02:55:02.175]  Very important.
[02:55:02.175 --> 02:55:06.999]  We have Dreams from My Real Father, Joel Gilbert, available at Infowarshop.com.
[02:55:06.999 --> 02:55:08.761]  A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City, 1995.
[02:55:08.761 --> 02:55:12.704]  The Money Masters, such an important film to understand the banksters.
[02:55:13.685 --> 02:55:17.129]  And of course, Clouded Titles, the book by David Krieger.

[02:55:21.473 --> 02:55:26.677]  And please support our local AminFM affiliate sponsors as well, including if you're a local business.
[02:55:27.628 --> 02:55:29.428]  Becoming a sponsor.
[02:55:29.428 --> 02:55:31.749]  There's a lot of ways to defeat the globalists.
[02:55:31.749 --> 02:55:33.929]  Many hands make light work.
[02:55:33.929 --> 02:55:39.570]  We're also carrying a new film, Nullification, The Right Remedy, about Tenth Amendment issues.
[02:55:39.570 --> 02:55:44.251]  Again, we got a few minutes left with Chuck Undersea of Behold a Pale Horse.
[02:55:44.251 --> 02:55:49.072]  Excited to hear part two and three are going to be out, I guess, in the next year or so.
[02:55:49.072 --> 02:55:50.972]  But very exciting film.
[02:55:50.972 --> 02:55:53.593]  Other points you'd like to add here at the end of the hour, Chuck?
[02:55:54.540 --> 02:56:05.502]  Yeah, we do hope to have the... We're editing currently for Part 2 and Part 3 and look forward to further collaboration with you, but the... I feel we can have them out by the election because, as we all know, time is short.
[02:56:05.502 --> 02:56:10.383]  I... You know, we live in a very remote area.
[02:56:10.383 --> 02:56:16.465]  In fact, I had to come to town to... I'm at National Headquarters Sheriff Richard Mack because I don't have a phone out there.
[02:56:16.465 --> 02:56:17.865]  We had to come use his phone.
[02:56:17.865 --> 02:56:22.906]  But the point is, I get up in the morning to feed the horses and the cattle are coming up and the chickens are crowing.
[02:56:23.758 --> 02:56:25.660]  And it's just idyllic.
[02:56:25.660 --> 02:56:27.941]  And we designed it to be that way, of course.
[02:56:27.941 --> 02:56:29.202]  And we don't have electricity.
[02:56:29.202 --> 02:56:30.343]  We don't have TV.
[02:56:30.343 --> 02:56:33.806]  We just wanted to get back to reality.
[02:56:33.806 --> 02:56:41.972]  But one of the poignant moments in the film was Michael Bednorik, who said, once you know, you can never not know.
[02:56:41.972 --> 02:56:44.574]  And I don't want to know.
[02:56:44.574 --> 02:56:45.534]  I'm sure you don't.
[02:56:45.534 --> 02:56:49.437]  It would be nice if the world were Norman Rockwell, but it's not.
[02:56:49.437 --> 02:56:53.040]  And I think we all have to realize slumber is over.
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:57:01.822]  You know, we should quit running around saying, God bless America, and focus on, bless God, America.
[02:57:01.822 --> 02:57:13.286]  What we have done through abortion and being the scourge of the globe and taking God out of everything in the country has created a situation where we're under judgment.
[02:57:13.286 --> 02:57:16.947]  And if we can turn it around, if we don't make the effort
[02:57:19.113 --> 02:57:20.014]  That's right.
[02:57:20.014 --> 02:57:24.959]  God is using people like you and many others to give people a final warning.
[02:57:24.959 --> 02:57:28.322]  And if we don't make a big turn now, it's going to be bad news.
[02:57:28.322 --> 02:57:31.865]  Chuck Undersea, we have huge breaking news in the final minutes of this hour.
[02:57:31.865 --> 02:57:32.506]  God bless you.
[02:57:32.506 --> 02:57:35.328]  Folks should get the film at Infowarshop.com.
[02:57:35.328 --> 02:57:36.309]  Behold a pale horse.
[02:57:36.309 --> 02:57:38.371]  We're going to talk to you in studio very soon.
[02:57:38.371 --> 02:57:41.654]  I want to get you and your wife in here so folks can take a look at you.
[02:57:41.654 --> 02:57:42.936]  I've had a chance to meet you in person.
[02:57:42.936 --> 02:57:43.556]  You're a great guy.
[02:57:43.556 --> 02:57:44.057]  God bless you.
[02:57:44.738 --> 02:57:45.138]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:57:45.138 --> 02:57:46.099]  Talk to you soon.
[02:57:46.099 --> 02:57:46.679]  You bet.
[02:57:46.679 --> 02:57:48.501]  I just looked at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:48.501 --> 02:57:53.584]  Believe it or not, the battery ran out in my wireless thing and I hadn't looked at it in about 30 minutes.
[02:57:53.584 --> 02:57:54.185]  Report!
[02:57:54.185 --> 02:57:57.327]  Russia moves nuclear missiles to Cuba.
[02:57:57.327 --> 02:57:58.508]  Wow!
[02:57:58.508 --> 02:58:00.309]  That's up at InfoWars.com.

[02:58:10.543 --> 02:58:11.763]  Man, I tell you, it's getting crazy.

[02:58:34.310 --> 02:58:34.930]  Wow!
[02:58:34.930 --> 02:58:38.291]  I mean, this is, it's just, it's getting crazy.
