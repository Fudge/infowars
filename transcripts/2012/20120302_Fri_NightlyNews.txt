[00:00:21.581 --> 00:00:29.984]  Well, I'm back in Austin, Texas after being out of town for more than a week and a half and broadcasting from the road, and it's good to be back in the studios with the crew.
[00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:32.145]  And we've got a doozy here.
[00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:35.667]  We could probably have four or five shows just out of what you're about to see tonight.
[00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:36.907]  I'm proud of the crew.
[00:00:36.947 --> 00:00:43.190]  They always overproduce because, well, they love liberty and they want to expose corruption and tyranny.
[00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.711]  Sunshine is the answer to the darkness.
[00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.033]  We've got Wayne Madsen formally with the NSA.
[00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:55.897]  We'll talk about Breitbart, some mysterious death, and more, and the threats that Wayne Madsen's been getting.
[00:00:56.737 --> 00:01:04.301]  Then I'm going to premiere here the hour and a half speech I gave in Dallas, my blueprint to defeat the New World Order.
[00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:15.731]  This is going to be like a three-hour transmission, or close to it, this evening on the InfoWars Nightly News for all of you out there watching.
[00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:20.435]  But first, I want to get into Texas Independence Day, because I forgot and didn't mention this on the radio today.
[00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:24.339]  My family on both sides was involved in Texas Independence.
[00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:25.580]  I've studied the history.
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.944]  My mother's part of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, and I can unequivocally tell you
[00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:39.397]  That despite what the government training camps try to teach you in public schools here in Texas and across the U.S., there was nothing racial about the war for independence.
[00:01:40.358 --> 00:01:41.699]  Slavery had nothing to do with it.
[00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:43.240]  It was all over the fact.
[00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:48.006]  That the earlier Mexican government was fair, let you have guns and own your property.
[00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:53.570]  Santa Ana overthrew the government, became a dictator, took people's property all over Mexico.
[00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.973]  He had rebellions in the south of Mexico as well.
[00:01:57.414 --> 00:01:58.975]  He later got overthrown, by the way.
[00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:04.040]  And that more than 35% of those that rebelled were Hispanic.
[00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:14.152]  Mexicans, who then became Texans, and the fellow, you can go read it online, Mainline History, University of Texas, who wrote the Texas Constitution, was Hispanic.
[00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:17.694]  So they try to steal the Texas birthright from Hispanics.
[00:02:17.774 --> 00:02:19.916]  I know because I went to public school, and I went to college.
[00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:21.077]  It was bad mouth Texas.
[00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:26.821]  They tried to ban Texas Independence Day at UT to make it some type of racial issue.
[00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:33.999]  And I'm not saying that in the years that followed there wasn't friction and stuff that went on, but it was not about race, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:49.429]  It was about private property, and that's why the war started when the Mexican troops came to Gonzales to take the cannons and guns they'd been given to be part of the Mexican militia, to defend against Indians and other things, and also outlaws.
[00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.434]  So they came to take the guns that the previous Mexican government, that was freer, had given them.
[00:02:56.872 --> 00:02:57.092]  I don't
[00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:16.577]  On this day, March 2nd, 1836, the Lone Star State was born.
[00:03:16.637 --> 00:03:22.142]  The only state that was its own country, and then opted in to the Republic.
[00:03:22.582 --> 00:03:25.164]  And Texas has the strongest rights under international law.
[00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:30.529]  We have the French Legation, all of it, because Texas is the Lone Star State.
[00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:35.994]  And I thought that I would just mention the true history of that, because the system attacks it because they don't want it.
[00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:40.847]  Hispanics to feel like they're Texans when they're as Texan as it gets.
[00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:45.809]  There's nobody more Texan than Hispanic Texans and they don't want you to have that birthright.
[00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:47.610]  Don't let them take it away from you.
[00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.552]  Okay, shifting gears into other news here today.
[00:03:52.052 --> 00:03:52.132]  Ah!
[00:03:53.652 --> 00:04:00.216]  The BMJ, British medical journal, admits anti-psychotic drugs kill far more people than terrorism.
[00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:10.282]  Well yeah, in the trials of Eli Lilly for Prozac in the early 80s, it massively increased psychotic breaks, suicidal behavior, you name it.
[00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:21.995]  A new report published by the British Medical Journal has found that dangerous anti-psychotic drugs are responsible for killing at least 1,800 dementia patients a year, which means that more people are killed by U.S.
[00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:29.403]  Food and Drug Administration FDA-approved dementia drugs every two years than died in 9-11 terror attacks.
[00:04:29.443 --> 00:04:30.804]  And that's a very low number.
[00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:35.311]  And of course you get into all the other killings and the rest of it from the other drugs.
[00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:39.498]  It's in the hundreds of thousands every year that these drugs are killing.
[00:04:39.538 --> 00:04:40.739]  I don't like illegal drugs either.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.308]  Heroin, cocaine, those are certainly bad for you, but they kill nothing compared to what prescription drugs that are just...
[00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.572]  Just synthetic versions souped up.
[00:04:50.193 --> 00:04:51.334]  You know where heroin comes from?
[00:04:52.035 --> 00:04:58.782]  They'd sawed off tens of thousands of arms and legs on both sides of the Civil War in the 1860s here.
[00:04:59.303 --> 00:05:00.544]  And people were addicted to opium.
[00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:07.271]  So a company, Big Pharma, came out with something that would cure you of opium addiction.
[00:05:08.072 --> 00:05:11.933]  It was heroin, something like 10 times stronger, souped up opium.
[00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:17.935]  It's kind of like, we'll get you off the heroin with the methadone, which I don't think is worse, but it's certainly not better.
[00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:19.375]  It's just crazy.
[00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:23.016]  So there's the true history of that.
[00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.677]  These are just drug pushers that are so established.
[00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:29.854]  That they've made all the organic drugs illegal because they're in competition with them.
[00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:32.455]  Okay, continuing here.
[00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:37.376]  This case really blew me away because it developed live on the air yesterday.
[00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:42.978]  We've got some clips of that from the radio slash TV show of this 11 to 2 Central as it developed.
[00:05:42.998 --> 00:05:45.239]  But first I want to tell you what happened after the show yesterday.
[00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:49.014]  During a three-minute break, I walk out.
[00:05:49.074 --> 00:05:51.115]  Derren McBrain says, man, they bowed up to us.
[00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:52.156]  They followed us out.
[00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:53.357]  They wouldn't talk to us.
[00:05:53.397 --> 00:05:58.460]  They said, this isn't a press conference, even though there was three other local news cameras there.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.641]  They were talking to them.
[00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:08.006]  They knew who we were from our last report, which was a pretty fair report, I thought, about all these gunboats they're buying that cost close to $700,000 a piece.
[00:06:08.967 --> 00:06:11.288]  So I go on air and I say, man, they bowed up to my reporters.
[00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.829]  They did all this.
[00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.311]  Then the phone starts ringing.
[00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:24.093]  I got one, two, three, four, five calls, text messages, program director, the manager, the news director, the producers.
[00:06:24.733 --> 00:06:36.117]  Turns out before we even went down there yesterday, for three days before, the state police were calling up producer numbers, their liaison in the news department and our local 590 affiliate.
[00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:40.738]  Asking weird questions about me and stuff.
[00:06:40.758 --> 00:06:47.120]  So we must have hit a nerve, because from what I've seen, these boats should cost about $150,000, the equivalent of another $100,000 to $200,000.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:53.203]  So it looks like they should pay $350,000 for these boats, not close to $700,000.
[00:06:53.263 --> 00:06:55.543]  So I think we hit a nerve here.
[00:06:55.824 --> 00:07:00.926]  We need to look at who they bought them from, what they did, because they are freaking out over this.
[00:07:01.586 --> 00:07:04.107]  And quite frankly, three months ago when the guys first did this report,
[00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:07.640]  Darren McBrain and others, I said, man, this is just a local issue.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.744]  So they're getting their own Navy.
[00:07:08.764 --> 00:07:11.252]  So they're going to have machine guns mounted on it.
[00:07:12.777 --> 00:07:13.477]  Okay, fine.
[00:07:13.897 --> 00:07:15.138]  But we got bigger fish to fry.
[00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:17.779]  Can I please have my killer flu story?
[00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:18.059]  Can I?
[00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.741]  Because again, most news departments, the news director, which I would be, tells you what the story is.
[00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.642]  I let the guys, most of the time, do their own stories.
[00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:29.183]  And occasionally I say what I want to be done.
[00:07:29.964 --> 00:07:32.965]  And they take that as optional, but it's not really optional.
[00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:34.325]  But they do a great job.
[00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:38.667]  And they're saying, no, the point is we're into freedom here.
[00:07:39.403 --> 00:07:41.825]  But now I realize their instinct to do this was good.
[00:07:42.206 --> 00:07:47.211]  Because, understand, they're calling up trying to basically get me off the air at 590.
[00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:49.012]  They called the program director.
[00:07:49.918 --> 00:07:56.141]  And we're like, Alex Jones is misrepresenting himself, one of their mind games, as 5'9", which is standard.
[00:07:57.442 --> 00:08:02.664]  Three months ago, when they called about, hey, we're coming to your press conference, because it said call first, I guess so they can spy on you.
[00:08:03.385 --> 00:08:08.107]  McBreen, you know, they said, okay, I guess that lady didn't know who I was.
[00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:11.049]  It turns out this head spokesman does.
[00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.789]  He says it on the tape.
[00:08:16.517 --> 00:08:18.879]  They say, AlexJonesInfoWars.com, and they say, what's that?
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.981]  Well, it's a radio TV host.
[00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:21.942]  Well, where's he on the radio?
[00:08:22.542 --> 00:08:22.923]  590 locally.
[00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:23.903]  Where's he on TV?
[00:08:23.943 --> 00:08:24.504]  Channel 10.
[00:08:24.884 --> 00:08:30.569]  So they took that, where I'm on radio and TV, and they spun it that we were misrepresenting ourselves.
[00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:33.111]  So this time they show up, they go, I'm not talking to you.
[00:08:33.391 --> 00:08:34.532]  You lied and said you're with 590.
[00:08:35.913 --> 00:08:39.796]  Well, we take these reports, those of you that listen in Austin, and play them this Sunday.
[00:08:40.077 --> 00:08:41.398]  I'm going to play this report on the radio.
[00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:49.055]  So, it's always about how we're bad, we're suspects, we're evil, and we're concerned about Alex Jones.
[00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:52.957]  Weird phone calls, different people, I guess trying to intimidate 590.
[00:08:53.518 --> 00:08:54.819]  Of course, it's the opposite.
[00:08:55.199 --> 00:08:56.500]  We just got the ratings.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.422]  In fact, I have the congratulations right here.
[00:08:59.963 --> 00:09:04.506]  You know, we're number one in Orlando, number one in Rochester, and many other areas.
[00:09:04.626 --> 00:09:08.249]  Number one, now that the instant people meters are coming out, replacing Arbitron.
[00:09:09.284 --> 00:09:13.347]  We're number one in several demographics for all radio in Central Texas.
[00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:18.792]  We're number two in the key demographic of, what, 18 to 54.
[00:09:18.872 --> 00:09:21.034]  In fact, where's my iPhone?
[00:09:21.074 --> 00:09:22.415]  He sent me the ratings on it today.
[00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:23.996]  He was telling me about it on the phone yesterday.
[00:09:24.277 --> 00:09:27.319]  And it was just like, oh, you know, we're so proud of what you're doing.
[00:09:27.339 --> 00:09:30.822]  We need to work on, you know, trying to get it on primetime, the show.
[00:09:30.842 --> 00:09:33.244]  Oh, there's Discovery Channel calling.
[00:09:33.264 --> 00:09:34.145]  I was supposed to call them back.
[00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:39.328]  I mean, here's this cop implying I'm not media and I'm lying I'm media.
[00:09:39.688 --> 00:09:43.070]  And here I am missing calls from Discovery Channel that wants to give me shows and stuff.
[00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:46.271]  I'm not bragging about how big we are.
[00:09:46.492 --> 00:09:47.472]  It's actually dangerous.
[00:09:47.812 --> 00:09:49.994]  I'm just sick of them playing their mind games.
[00:09:50.894 --> 00:09:51.534]  All right, enough.
[00:09:51.835 --> 00:09:52.915]  I kind of intro it here.
[00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:56.837]  It's just that... Let me give you those numbers here.
[00:09:56.857 --> 00:09:57.658]  Let me pull up those ratings.
[00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:01.420]  Tell you what we got going on here.
[00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:05.243]  No, it's 25 to 54.
[00:10:05.684 --> 00:10:08.509]  The key demographic, number two.
[00:10:10.095 --> 00:10:13.098]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and go to this piece.
[00:10:13.558 --> 00:10:17.722]  Here it is where the state police think they control the media now, like this is North Korea.
[00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:18.182]  Here it is.
[00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:22.886]  Now we are here for the unveiling of yet another DPS patrol vessel.
[00:10:23.226 --> 00:10:32.114]  Now this is the second boat of what will eventually be a total of six 34-foot shallow water interceptors to patrol the Rio Grande River.
[00:10:32.474 --> 00:10:36.057]  As the Texas Highway Patrol goes on a wild spinning spree,
[00:10:36.317 --> 00:10:40.261]  These hot rod boats cost approximately $600,000 each.
[00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:46.467]  And yes, that's taxpayer money to fight Al Qaeda and the small-time drug traffickers on the Texas rivers.
[00:10:47.148 --> 00:10:56.898]  They're buying these giant $690-something-thousand-dollar speed boats for lakes and rivers that have giant machine guns mounted all over them.
[00:10:58.451 --> 00:11:03.233]  And they didn't have the machine guns mounted three months ago when we first went out and talked to them in a lake.
[00:11:03.753 --> 00:11:04.654]  They didn't know who we were.
[00:11:04.674 --> 00:11:07.495]  We did a nice interview, put it on TV.
[00:11:07.675 --> 00:11:13.037]  I made my points about how we're going bankrupt, but they're constantly militarizing our police.
[00:11:13.497 --> 00:11:18.259]  Darren McBreen and John Brown went out there politely, and they were bowing up.
[00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:21.500]  They were saying, we're not going to talk to you, even though it was a press event that they called.
[00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:24.962]  They had state police standing right up in their space.
[00:11:25.462 --> 00:11:27.783]  And when they left, they had state police follow them.
[00:11:28.303 --> 00:11:30.485]  Out of the parking lot, over by the lake.
[00:11:30.685 --> 00:11:32.186]  I mean, here's my deal, man.
[00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:35.648]  I mean, you guys misrepresented yourselves with KLBJ.
[00:11:35.708 --> 00:11:37.650]  I called them and they're like, no, they don't work for us.
[00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.291]  It's not a misrepresentation.
[00:11:39.311 --> 00:11:40.932]  We're a broadcast on KLBJ.
[00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:42.433]  I mean, this is a public place.
[00:11:42.453 --> 00:11:44.535]  You're welcome to film.
[00:11:44.575 --> 00:11:47.256]  But there's not a media representative that'll talk to us?
[00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:47.637]  No.
[00:11:47.797 --> 00:11:50.859]  It goes on to say, are John Bowne and Darren McBreen on your staff?
[00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:51.960]  The DPS contacted.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.842]  Our DPS contact.
[00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:57.802]  And we're also affiliated with your show.
[00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.143]  Can you shed any light on this?
[00:11:59.163 --> 00:12:01.364]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:12:01.684 --> 00:12:07.948]  The state police are calling our local affiliate because, wait, the media's not supposed to ask us questions.
[00:12:08.348 --> 00:12:08.769]  Wait a minute.
[00:12:08.989 --> 00:12:10.990]  You're not supposed to discuss what's going on.
[00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.111]  You're supposed to take it.
[00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:14.992]  You're supposed to, we give you a press release and you read it on air.
[00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.233]  That's how America works.
[00:12:16.273 --> 00:12:18.194]  We don't have a free press in America.
[00:12:18.474 --> 00:12:19.975]  I mean, I have some talking points if you want to know.
[00:12:20.296 --> 00:12:21.696]  I have some talking points.
[00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.531]  I think we got those pretty much last time.
[00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:25.811]  I mean, they're pretty much the same.
[00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.632]  I know the cost of the boats and all that.
[00:12:28.212 --> 00:12:37.095]  But we're just kind of wondering about joint military exercises, stuff like that, you know, if there's any... I mean, yeah, there's no joint military exercises plan that I'm aware of.
[00:12:37.475 --> 00:12:38.476]  They're spending $600,000 on these... 600 plus!
[00:12:42.818 --> 00:12:44.999]  Yeah, for a total of six of them.
[00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:47.680]  And this is the unveiling of the second one.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.601]  With machine guns, militarizing, and they don't like it.
[00:12:50.881 --> 00:12:55.003]  It's wrong to sit there and try to violate press freedom in this country.
[00:12:55.343 --> 00:13:00.905]  Can you believe calling up our affiliate, trying to imply we're doing something wrong, playing weird legalese games?
[00:13:01.305 --> 00:13:03.726]  And by them following us, it seemed like intimidation.
[00:13:03.926 --> 00:13:05.266]  You know, it was pure intimidation.
[00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:06.327]  Well, I mean, he's calling!
[00:13:06.507 --> 00:13:09.448]  I know they plan on buying a lot of these unmanned drones.
[00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.873]  The state of Texas is not?
[00:13:15.454 --> 00:13:18.036]  Because there's like border patrol with the drones and all that.
[00:13:18.056 --> 00:13:22.161]  But they're working with federal agencies, that's what I mean.
[00:13:22.221 --> 00:13:30.670]  So it'd be like Homeland Security for example is federal, yet they provided a lot of the funding for these boats that are here in the state.
[00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.331]  So that's why I was wondering if there's any
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:33.940]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.901]  We don't have drones.
[00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:36.361]  Whose drones do we have access to?
[00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:36.921]  I'm not even sure.
[00:13:47.546 --> 00:13:48.226]  I hope you're right.
[00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:48.767]  I hope you're right.
[00:14:16.281 --> 00:14:16.621]  We are right.
[00:14:17.082 --> 00:14:24.366]  Well, you know, sometimes they do, you know, but like, you know, same with the Patriot Act was supposed to be just for terrorists and then they end up, you know, going after more than just terrorists.
[00:14:25.166 --> 00:14:26.347]  And these are just questions, man.
[00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:30.549]  A lot of people get offended by these questions like this, you know, so there's checks and balances, you know.
[00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:38.213]  Well, they were really shook up by Darren McBrain because after this happened, they were just going completely ape.
[00:14:39.214 --> 00:14:39.354]  And...
[00:14:40.305 --> 00:14:45.249]  We still got our interview because they were doing interviews before we got there and then said, oh, we're not doing interviews.
[00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:47.271]  Well, we just set up a camera 50 feet away.
[00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:48.152]  He asked the questions.
[00:14:48.192 --> 00:14:48.773]  There they are.
[00:14:50.094 --> 00:15:01.184]  And again, the state police haven't even been on my radar screen, but now you are on our radar screen trying to imply we're not media, trying to imply there we are with a microphone saying InfoWars.
[00:15:02.199 --> 00:15:03.920]  And you're like, well, you're not on 590.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.261]  Because before they said, well, where are you broadcast?
[00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:08.402]  Always implying, like, we're not media.
[00:15:08.802 --> 00:15:10.403]  And we're like, well, 590 Channel 10.
[00:15:10.803 --> 00:15:11.344]  Well, you're not 590.
[00:15:11.604 --> 00:15:16.947]  I liken this to, uh, Weldon Henson runs my shipping department.
[00:15:17.387 --> 00:15:19.068]  And he can fill up 500 people.
[00:15:19.848 --> 00:15:21.809]  He just played a couple thousand at the Houston Rodeo.
[00:15:24.349 --> 00:15:25.230]  That's his night job.
[00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.651]  His day job is working here.
[00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:31.433]  And that'd be like if he packs the Continental Club whenever he plays there once a month.
[00:15:31.954 --> 00:15:37.697]  If somebody called up the Continental Club and said, Weldon Henson, who plays country music, uh, does Weldon Henson work there?
[00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:39.598]  And they're like, well, no, but he plays here.
[00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.139]  Oh, he's a liar.
[00:15:41.159 --> 00:15:41.500]  He doesn't.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.181]  He's not at the Continental Club.
[00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:45.302]  I mean, it's like, it's like some kind of game.
[00:15:45.882 --> 00:15:51.386]  And they're calling up like everybody over there going, Alex Jones and his people are misrepresenting that they work with you.
[00:15:53.482 --> 00:15:56.363]  I don't know, I just go to their events and speak at their events and I'm on the radio there.
[00:15:56.703 --> 00:15:59.945]  Sure, I've got my own sprawling complex here.
[00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:02.306]  I mean, I'm on over a hundred AM and FM stations.
[00:16:02.726 --> 00:16:07.889]  Again, it shows the system cannot deal with the fact that you don't have air superiority anymore.
[00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:11.030]  You're not just going to do this to us in the dark anymore.
[00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:16.152]  Buddy, we have millions of listeners a day.
[00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:21.630]  Yeah, but that doesn't count.
[00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.933]  It doesn't count that on Alexa.com we're much bigger than MSNBC.com.
[00:16:24.953 --> 00:16:25.874]  You can go see it.
[00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:26.775]  It doesn't count.
[00:16:26.795 --> 00:16:28.236]  It doesn't count how many.
[00:16:28.256 --> 00:16:30.278]  It doesn't matter if I have 15 million listeners a week.
[00:16:30.619 --> 00:16:33.261]  It doesn't matter if I'm on the cover of Talker's Magazine.
[00:16:33.562 --> 00:16:34.362]  It doesn't matter.
[00:16:34.683 --> 00:16:35.544]  It doesn't matter.
[00:16:35.844 --> 00:16:41.750]  It doesn't matter because you are God and you're going to call up and imply I'm a lying dirtbag.
[00:16:45.734 --> 00:16:48.657]  Oh yeah, they determined you weren't media in Pittsburgh and arrested you.
[00:16:48.817 --> 00:16:51.199]  They said, oh, you're filming us attacking people.
[00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:54.822]  We're going to let all the mainstream media out, but you're not media.
[00:16:55.203 --> 00:16:55.883]  Well, we're suing them.
[00:16:56.964 --> 00:17:00.288]  And they've already tried to settle the dude, but that's not happening.
[00:17:01.589 --> 00:17:02.610]  There was no settlement made.
[00:17:04.572 --> 00:17:05.733]  You're not media.
[00:17:05.773 --> 00:17:06.593]  You're trash.
[00:17:06.633 --> 00:17:07.494]  You're scum.
[00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:08.495]  Okay?
[00:17:08.515 --> 00:17:11.198]  You're not a big corporate New World Order outfit that reads off a teleprompter.
[00:17:12.523 --> 00:17:14.986]  In fact, Darren, during that report, he's like, do you got any talking points?
[00:17:15.887 --> 00:17:19.111]  Like, like, you're gonna give me those and I'm gonna give you a sheet back.
[00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:20.613]  This is not real reporting.
[00:17:20.893 --> 00:17:26.520]  In the old days, government ran from reporters because they knew they were all there trying to get the muckraking story.
[00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:28.262]  That was the style of journalism.
[00:17:28.543 --> 00:17:29.784]  And news was exciting, man.
[00:17:29.824 --> 00:17:30.425]  It was like, you know.
[00:17:31.286 --> 00:17:38.632]  There was like every town, just the town, 60, 70 years ago, a town the size of Austin would have like 10 newspapers.
[00:17:39.112 --> 00:17:41.554]  There'd be three or four that came out at 5 a.m.
[00:17:41.734 --> 00:17:44.756]  There'd be one that came out at 10, one at noon, one at 5.
[00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:49.560]  Then there'd be the couple of evenings, that's why there's all these papers have names like Evening Standard.
[00:17:50.081 --> 00:17:54.124]  Because you know, it's like up-to-date news, like the internet, man, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[00:17:54.384 --> 00:17:56.165]  And you're like, oh, I want that one, I want that one.
[00:17:56.405 --> 00:17:57.967]  And it was all about the muckraking.
[00:17:58.894 --> 00:18:00.375]  Now it's about lazy reporters.
[00:18:00.695 --> 00:18:01.935]  I've seen it in radio and TV.
[00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:04.896]  Just a press release comes in and they just read what government tells them.
[00:18:06.097 --> 00:18:07.477]  Well, this is teleprompter free, folks.
[00:18:07.537 --> 00:18:08.318]  It didn't happen in here.
[00:18:10.058 --> 00:18:11.259]  Okay, I'm done.
[00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:11.979]  I gotta hurry up here.
[00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:13.259]  We got like two more hours coming up.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.041]  Breitbart, I've talked to a lot of big talk show hosts.
[00:18:18.101 --> 00:18:20.062]  I've talked to folks that knew Breitbart well.
[00:18:20.082 --> 00:18:21.743]  And I don't just mean the reporter we talked to yesterday.
[00:18:21.783 --> 00:18:23.163]  I mean folks that know him well.
[00:18:24.844 --> 00:18:25.164]  Well.
[00:18:26.524 --> 00:18:27.725]  About as well as you're gonna know him.
[00:18:28.636 --> 00:18:30.538]  And the consensus is they think he was murdered.
[00:18:31.538 --> 00:18:38.804]  And I've talked to Corsi on the radio today, who's been talking to Breitbart just a few days ago, and is releasing all this birth certificate stuff with Sheriff Arpaio.
[00:18:39.304 --> 00:18:41.706]  The Sheriff's Department thinks they may be being threatened.
[00:18:42.947 --> 00:18:43.848]  This may be the White House.
[00:18:44.148 --> 00:18:45.589]  And they've beefed up all their security.
[00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.730]  And that broke today.
[00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.431]  That's big.
[00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:49.312]  In fact, I've got to call our writers.
[00:18:49.893 --> 00:18:52.975]  It's like Sheriff Arpaio and, you know, getting more security.
[00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:54.937]  I mean, because of Obama.
[00:18:54.957 --> 00:18:56.178]  I mean, this is breaking news.
[00:18:57.692 --> 00:19:01.494]  And he talked to Breitbart hours before he died on the phone.
[00:19:04.255 --> 00:19:05.095]  Wow, this is huge.
[00:19:05.995 --> 00:19:06.976]  Getting calls from New York.
[00:19:07.036 --> 00:19:07.776]  Let's see who this is.
[00:19:08.296 --> 00:19:08.696]  Hello?
[00:19:10.857 --> 00:19:11.197]  Hey!
[00:19:14.018 --> 00:19:15.459]  Oh, hey, you're the Discovery Channel guy?
[00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:18.480]  I'm sorry, I went over.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.420]  I totally apologize.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.441]  Can I call you back during our break in like five minutes?
[00:19:23.282 --> 00:19:23.602]  I apologize.
[00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:24.122]  I'll call you right back.
[00:19:25.782 --> 00:19:28.151]  I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, it's total transparency.
[00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:31.282]  I'm like an octopus here just getting stuff done.
[00:19:33.371 --> 00:19:36.694]  Breitbart, wait till they see what happens March 1st.
[00:19:36.954 --> 00:19:45.841]  So it turns out he was going to release the video of Obama and Comey meetings, and all the stuff that would bring him down March 1st, and he died a few hours before in the early hours of March 1st.
[00:19:46.281 --> 00:19:49.703]  That's one of the biggest stories in the country right now, up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:19:49.743 --> 00:20:00.752]  Also, Breitbart's footage shows Obama palling around with terrorists, weather underground, and now the Breitbart folks are saying that the
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:05.043]  The footage will be released within the next two weeks.
[00:20:06.483 --> 00:20:08.284]  Well, I want to know why it's going to be released in the next two weeks.
[00:20:08.384 --> 00:20:09.345]  It should come out now.
[00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:16.689]  But we'll go ahead and go to some of the other cases where we've heard of them talking about we'll see the video in the next two weeks.
[00:20:16.709 --> 00:20:18.330]  You know, I've heard that before in Hollywood.
[00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.751]  It'll take two weeks.
[00:20:19.811 --> 00:20:20.851]  Here's your pomade.
[00:20:21.572 --> 00:20:22.172]  Two weeks?
[00:20:23.893 --> 00:20:24.333]  Excuse me?
[00:20:25.274 --> 00:20:25.754]  Two weeks?
[00:20:26.454 --> 00:20:27.395]  That don't do me no good.
[00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:29.256]  Two weeks?
[00:20:31.184 --> 00:20:32.406]  Two weeks!
[00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:35.732]  Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity?
[00:20:36.273 --> 00:20:36.994]  Two weeks from everywhere!
[00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:38.637]  The Red Cross!
[00:20:40.069 --> 00:20:42.110]  There's a set of tapes and we're going through it.
[00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.071]  The staff, you know, he attracted fighters.
[00:20:44.111 --> 00:20:47.832]  He attracted guys like Joel Pollack and Ben Shapiro and Larry O'Connor.
[00:20:48.392 --> 00:20:53.674]  The guys are going through a series of tapes of President Obama at Harvard.
[00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:56.996]  And they'll be, we'll come back to you in a week or two.
[00:20:57.016 --> 00:20:58.616]  I think a week to ten days.
[00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.978]  This is something, Andrew, we're very systematic about going through these things.
[00:21:02.218 --> 00:21:03.778]  So, two weeks.
[00:21:03.818 --> 00:21:04.599]  We're gonna get those.
[00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:07.160]  It was gonna come out March 1st, but now it's two weeks.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:18.910]  And I just realized we got breaking news here that Arpaio and Corsi and others are having to get more security because they're concerned and think this may have been a hit.
[00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.674]  Man, that is some amazing breaking news right there.
[00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:33.142]  And with more on the mysterious death of Andrew Breitbart, we're joined by investigative journalist, former officer at the National Security Agency, Wayne Madsen.
[00:21:33.482 --> 00:21:34.743]  The reason I wanted to get Wayne on
[00:21:35.683 --> 00:21:51.393]  Is he had to leave the country for four or five months last year because high-level sources told him that the word is the White House is going to kill you, especially if you keep going to Chicago and investigating the mafia ties, the CIA ties, the ties to communist groups.
[00:21:51.433 --> 00:22:01.520]  Well, Andrew Breitbart was set, we've now confirmed as we just covered, to release March 1st, yesterday, the footage of Obama at these communist meetings.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.141]  Now, it's going to be a few weeks until those get released.
[00:22:05.221 --> 00:22:07.622]  Is something going to be redacted?
[00:22:08.422 --> 00:22:11.383]  Joining us is Wayne Madsen of waynemadsenreport.com.
[00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:12.723]  Wayne, thanks for joining us.
[00:22:13.344 --> 00:22:17.365]  What's your early first take and what are your sources saying about what happened to Breitbart?
[00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:35.076]  Well, I was covering the Conservative Political Action Committee annual meeting here in Washington about two and a half weeks ago, and I remember Breitbart giving one of these impassioned presentations.
[00:22:35.757 --> 00:22:41.961]  I was told by others there, now I don't recall him saying this, I was told by others there that he had this smoking gun
[00:22:43.138 --> 00:22:46.779]  Evidence, he didn't get into any details.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:59.664]  I spoke to Larry Sinclair, who has some information on Breitbart, apparently called the LA Medical Examiner's office and
[00:23:02.024 --> 00:23:06.227]  I think we have to look at the, you know, the jaded record of the L.A.
[00:23:06.407 --> 00:23:09.589]  Medical Examiner's Office and high-profile deaths.
[00:23:09.929 --> 00:23:12.671]  I mean, starting with Marilyn Monroe and a few others.
[00:23:13.632 --> 00:23:17.375]  But I think we have to wait to see what the autopsy says.
[00:23:18.135 --> 00:23:24.620]  And look, even if there are drugs found, the word is that he was drinking
[00:23:25.894 --> 00:23:36.760]  In a bar earlier that evening before he died of an apparent heart attack on the sidewalk, I guess, in the Brentwood neighborhood.
[00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:45.265]  And I've been cautioned many times to watch my own unattended glass of wine.
[00:23:46.312 --> 00:23:55.640]  And various establishments I've been to here in Washington, because as you said, I received three credible threats from three credible sources.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.523]  So I, I don't take those threats lightly.
[00:23:58.543 --> 00:24:09.393]  And look, I mean, look, the history, we've had some journalists in this country who were, have been murdered, starting with Danny Casolaro, who was investigating
[00:24:09.973 --> 00:24:10.953]  George H.W.
[00:24:10.993 --> 00:24:15.394]  Bush and Gary Webb, who supposedly committed suicide.
[00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:17.094]  Both of these were said to be suicides.
[00:24:17.475 --> 00:24:25.576]  Gary Webb had done a seminal work on the whole CIA cocaine importation business in this country.
[00:24:26.036 --> 00:24:39.239]  So, you know, I don't take the fact that a journalist who may be on the verge of something dying suddenly, you know, I say let's wait for the evidence.
[00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:41.020]  Well, I know this.
[00:24:42.121 --> 00:24:51.910]  Kind of, you know, alternative Republican muckrakers like Michael Savage are hiding out, do have bodyguards.
[00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:57.675]  I knew this from private sources and never mentioned it, but now Savage has talked about the fact that he warned
[00:24:59.042 --> 00:24:59.402]  We're good to go.
[00:25:28.007 --> 00:25:32.150]  Not to look at this suspiciously, but yeah, he could have died of drugs, heart attack, whatever.
[00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:41.397]  The fact that it's the day he's saying he's going to release this stuff, and then now it hasn't been released, that just sends up big red flags for me.
[00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.931]  Well, you know, and let's look at whatever he had.
[00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:58.235]  If it's early footage or photographic evidence of Obama attending Marxist meetings or communist meetings, whether he was there with Bill Ayers or Bernie
[00:25:59.095 --> 00:26:01.376]  Bernadine Dorn or any of these people.
[00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:08.597]  My contention is that Obama was selected at a very young age to infiltrate these groups.
[00:26:08.757 --> 00:26:19.760]  And I got word, of course, from old members of the Black Panther Party in Chicago that when he showed up after he left that CIA job in Manhattan, when he showed up and
[00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:27.615]  Chicago suddenly and saying, hey, I'm Barry Obama, and I'm really, you know, I'm really in with you guys here.
[00:26:27.755 --> 00:26:32.236]  And they told me they knew he was a plant from the very beginning, because they said he was a phony.
[00:26:32.596 --> 00:26:38.937]  They knew he wasn't from their neighborhood, that he had been parachuted in, is the word I got.
[00:26:39.637 --> 00:26:47.319]  And they were, you know, having dealt with COINTELPRO and FBI infiltrators for years, they were very suspicious of him.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:27:05.041]  So, I think this has to be, this report, if true, has to be looked at in context that Obama was, you know, basically chosen to infiltrate these various groups because of his own background.
[00:27:06.311 --> 00:27:15.057]  Half African American, had an Indonesian stepfather, attended a Muslim school in Jakarta.
[00:27:15.637 --> 00:27:18.980]  So, you know, this was the perfect candidate.
[00:27:20.301 --> 00:27:23.183]  He's been an operative most of his life and lived around it.
[00:27:24.183 --> 00:27:27.885]  You've been to Indonesia, you've been to the Middle East, you've been to Libya, you've tracked all this.
[00:27:28.866 --> 00:27:35.049]  But you didn't start getting these death threats from sources saying, yeah, this is coming from the White House as a warning until last year.
[00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.471]  What was it you were working on?
[00:27:37.491 --> 00:27:38.951]  I mean, I know it was going to Chicago.
[00:27:39.472 --> 00:27:43.554]  What were you looking into that has got them threatening you?
[00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:46.596]  Because obviously, that's where we need to look closer.
[00:27:47.768 --> 00:27:57.053]  Yeah, well it wasn't the story that of course Larry Sinclair advanced about his, at least his bisexuality.
[00:27:57.913 --> 00:28:03.616]  What I was warned off on was the background of Obama in Indonesia.
[00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:06.938]  With the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:28:06.958 --> 00:28:09.359]  This is the one thing that they can't handle at the White House.
[00:28:09.379 --> 00:28:13.141]  The reason being is, they can handle this birth certificate story.
[00:28:13.162 --> 00:28:14.622]  They basically run Hawaii.
[00:28:15.323 --> 00:28:17.104]  Neil Abercrombie is the governor.
[00:28:17.204 --> 00:28:22.727]  He knew Stanley Ann Dunham, Obama's mother.
[00:28:22.947 --> 00:28:23.868]  He knew the family.
[00:28:23.888 --> 00:28:31.913]  And he's governor of Hawaii now, so of course he's in a position to tamp anything down on that front.
[00:28:32.353 --> 00:28:49.099]  But I always thought that the real issue with Obama and the one that they really can't handle is his links and his possible ties to the Central Intelligence Agency as early on as Occidental in L.A., but possibly
[00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:59.264]  Even traveling on an Indonesian passport after he reached the age of 18, going to Pakistan, going to India, traveling around on that.
[00:28:59.364 --> 00:29:13.372]  And that was basically confirmed to me by somebody who was very close to the Office of President of Indonesia, the current President of Indonesia, whose prior job, of course, was the head of the Indonesian intelligence service.
[00:29:14.215 --> 00:29:15.896]  Let's shift gears into NDAA.
[00:29:15.936 --> 00:29:21.580]  That's really blown up in Obama's face, the fact that he demanded the secret arrest provisions and the power to kill citizens.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.222]  It's obviously unconstitutional, but he says he has that power.
[00:29:24.802 --> 00:29:31.787]  Now he's saying he won't enforce it and has signed this executive directive to the bureaucracies.
[00:29:31.827 --> 00:29:38.632]  But when you have a president seeking the power to kill citizens, even in America, and then his political enemies start dying mysteriously,
[00:29:39.858 --> 00:29:42.979]  That pretty much convicts him right there that he was seeking this power.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.641]  I mean, could we see the implementation of NDAA taking place?
[00:29:46.981 --> 00:29:56.726]  We saw Judge Andrew Napolitano, who was anti-war and anti-Republican and Democratic establishment, with some of the highest ratings on Fox Business, fired.
[00:29:57.146 --> 00:29:58.587]  We saw the same week Buchanan.
[00:29:59.247 --> 00:29:59.647]  Fired.
[00:29:59.707 --> 00:30:03.389]  He said, he was told, don't criticize the war, don't criticize what Israel's doing.
[00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:10.713]  So I'm seeing a purge, and I've talked to high-level people in the media who've been told, leave Obama alone.
[00:30:11.173 --> 00:30:17.637]  Basically, Rupert Murdoch is being blackmailed by the Justice Department over his crimes in England.
[00:30:18.237 --> 00:30:21.919]  And sure enough, we now see his son leaving England, people getting arrested.
[00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:23.860]  I'm not saying what they did in England was okay.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:34.355]  It's just that I think we're seeing an internal power structure battle, because they're obviously for the same global corporate fascist system, but they're fighting over who gets to control that trough.
[00:30:34.796 --> 00:30:35.698]  What's your take on that?
[00:30:36.872 --> 00:30:52.523]  Well, look, I think this all started with Bush when we had the unitary executive basically become the law of the land, that the White House enjoys sovereign immunity, even over the Constitution of the United States.
[00:30:53.063 --> 00:30:56.245]  And then Obama's done nothing to give up any of those powers.
[00:30:56.325 --> 00:31:00.068]  As a matter of fact, he's taken on even more powers.
[00:31:00.128 --> 00:31:05.572]  For example, Obama is currently prosecuting at least seven
[00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:09.714]  People under the Espionage Act from 1917.
[00:31:10.315 --> 00:31:19.181]  Now, this is the law that Woodrow Wilson used to go after people who thought we shouldn't be getting into World War I on behalf of the United Kingdom.
[00:31:19.761 --> 00:31:23.264]  And it was, of course, it was upgraded in
[00:31:27.763 --> 00:31:42.554]  48 by Senator Pat McCarran of course it was the McCarran Act was finally passed in 1950 and that had to do with further establishing the national security state during the Alger Hiss investigation.
[00:31:42.614 --> 00:31:48.599]  So what we have are a Cold War and a World War I law being used now to stifle
[00:31:49.139 --> 00:32:06.345]  People in the government from reporting wrongdoing to journalists and we still have the government trying to put a New York Times reporter in jail for not going before a grand jury to reveal his sources.
[00:32:07.146 --> 00:32:07.786]  Jim Risen.
[00:32:08.386 --> 00:32:20.534]  So, in this respect, Obama is worse than Bush when it comes to this frontal attack on freedom of the press in this country.
[00:32:21.895 --> 00:32:33.742]  Now, would they go the extra mile and start doing things to journalists or bloggers or anyone else who they find is a threat?
[00:32:35.843 --> 00:32:42.084]  I'm still of an open mind because I received, like I said, I received three credible threats that I took seriously.
[00:32:42.185 --> 00:32:45.666]  So I wouldn't, I would not put it past them to do that.
[00:32:46.926 --> 00:32:52.128]  But I think we have to wait before we, you know, start saying anything else.
[00:32:52.248 --> 00:32:53.948]  Let's wait to see what the L.A.
[00:32:54.008 --> 00:32:56.049]  Medical Examiner's Office has to say.
[00:32:57.109 --> 00:33:01.230]  Sure, but again, I go back to that point that I made right as you were coming on.
[00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:09.453]  The fact that within two hours or a little bit less of him being announced dead, they were saying natural causes, nothing to worry about, move along, move along.
[00:33:10.033 --> 00:33:20.416]  And any other time I've seen it, like with Gary Webb or other cases you mentioned, when they do kill somebody, they immediately announce that it was suicide or natural causes when there is foul play.
[00:33:21.812 --> 00:33:42.725]  I'll tell you, I was almost as surprised to hear who his father-in-law was, Orson Bean, the old panelist on To Tell the Truth, who I think was one of the first people who indicated that it might have been from natural causes, but I frankly thought that Orson Bean had died years ago, so I was almost as surprised about that.
[00:33:42.745 --> 00:33:44.546]  I mean, it's very bizarre.
[00:33:46.428 --> 00:33:49.830]  And wasn't Orson Bean even blacklisted back during the Red Scare?
[00:33:50.834 --> 00:33:58.678]  Yeah, apparently he was an aspiring actor in Hollywood who was accused of attending Communist Party meetings, okay?
[00:33:58.718 --> 00:34:14.666]  So, you know, here we go, full circle, and he was sort of blacklisted in the 50s, so his career really had to do with appearing on, you know, as a panelist on To Tell the Truth and The Match Game with, you know, Bud Collier and Gene Rayburn.
[00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:17.601]  Beyond bizarre.
[00:34:18.062 --> 00:34:22.063]  Now, I always love the wild card here because we don't do pre-interviews with you, obviously.
[00:34:23.703 --> 00:34:35.827]  But you did, right before we went on, mention that you were at the CPAC event and you talked to Mr. Sinclair and he said he did talk to Andrew Breitbart.
[00:34:35.847 --> 00:34:40.069]  So tell us about that and then briefly any other things you're investigating right now.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.902]  Yeah, I spoke to Larry.
[00:34:43.422 --> 00:34:52.270]  I spoke to him at CPAC, but I talked to him this morning and there was an event called a Bloggers Bash at CPAC.
[00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:58.596]  I was not there, but Larry was there and he told me the next day that he had spoken to Breitbart.
[00:34:59.595 --> 00:35:09.064]  And Breitbart had told him about wait till March the 1st about something now in Breitbart speech to the whole CPAC audience.
[00:35:10.045 --> 00:35:14.029]  He said that they said something about some sort of.
[00:35:14.689 --> 00:35:15.349]  We have that clip.
[00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.750]  In fact, I was going to play it at the end of the interview.
[00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:19.971]  Do we have that clip right now?
[00:35:20.031 --> 00:35:20.251]  Yes.
[00:35:20.471 --> 00:35:21.552]  Yeah, let's go ahead.
[00:35:21.872 --> 00:35:22.892]  Can we play that where he can hear it?
[00:35:43.939 --> 00:35:44.459]  Okay, great.
[00:35:44.479 --> 00:35:44.799]  Yeah, I know.
[00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:45.860]  Here's the clip.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.341]  In fact, we put this out yesterday morning.
[00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:54.263]  We dug up where he told three different sources, yeah, I'm going to release the communist stuff on March 1st.
[00:35:54.343 --> 00:35:55.924]  Obama's going to really not like this.
[00:35:56.344 --> 00:35:57.225]  We're going to take him down.
[00:35:57.285 --> 00:36:01.146]  So yes, he did indeed say and do that, Wayne.
[00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:03.707]  Here is that clip of him at CPAC.
[00:36:04.068 --> 00:36:07.149]  And so what do we get now in Barack Obama?
[00:36:07.629 --> 00:36:09.190]  Well, I've got videos, by the way.
[00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.191]  This election, we're going to vet him.
[00:36:11.752 --> 00:36:12.592]  I've got videos.
[00:36:13.013 --> 00:36:36.408]  This election, we're going to vet him from his college days to show you why racial division and class warfare are central to what Hope and Change was sold in 2008.
[00:36:38.775 --> 00:37:06.696]  The videos are going to come out, the narrative is going to come out, that Barack Obama met a bunch of silver ponytails back in the 1980s, like Bill and Bernadine Dorn, who, equally radical, said, one day, we're going to have the presidency, and the rest of us slept while they plotted, and they plotted, and they plotted, and they oversaw hundreds of millions of dollars in the Annenberg Challenge, and they had real money!
[00:37:07.441 --> 00:37:08.662]  From real capitalists!
[00:37:08.922 --> 00:37:09.943]  So there it is, Wayne.
[00:37:09.983 --> 00:37:11.003]  You were there but missed that.
[00:37:11.023 --> 00:37:12.384]  But no, it's not a rumor.
[00:37:12.424 --> 00:37:12.865]  There it is.
[00:37:14.005 --> 00:37:14.566]  Right, right.
[00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:27.674]  And as I say, look, there's a lot of questions about Bill Ayers himself, whether he was in fact also a deep plant for the U.S.
[00:37:27.734 --> 00:37:28.915]  intelligence community to
[00:37:29.688 --> 00:37:36.692]  You know, basically root out, you know, confirmed members of the Weatherman faction of the SDS.
[00:37:36.733 --> 00:37:44.037]  Well, why did Bill Clinton pardon so many convicted communist bombers who had actually bombed police and people?
[00:37:44.357 --> 00:37:46.639]  That does point towards them actually being operatives.
[00:37:47.984 --> 00:37:58.793]  Yeah, and look, even Bill Clinton, we know that when he was at Oxford, he went over to Moscow and it was thought that he was ratting out members of the National Students Association.
[00:37:58.813 --> 00:38:05.978]  We know that the National Students Association was jam-packed full of informants.
[00:38:07.159 --> 00:38:14.085]  That the leader of the National Students Association included a later congressman named Howard Lowenstein from New York.
[00:38:14.865 --> 00:38:21.566]  Uh, was working for the CIA, at the same time that he was a leader of the National Students Association.
[00:38:21.827 --> 00:38:23.227]  This was a CIA front.
[00:38:23.447 --> 00:38:36.870]  And of course, their whole, the whole issue was to be invited to these communist-sponsored World Youth Conferences and, you know, every place from Havana to Belgrade to Moscow and other places to, uh, you know,
[00:38:39.057 --> 00:38:40.198]  Thank you very much.
[00:38:52.898 --> 00:38:55.139]  But it's not just they're infiltrating, as you just pointed out.
[00:38:55.459 --> 00:38:56.960]  Sometimes they're leading the groups.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.261]  They want to create their own opposition.
[00:38:59.301 --> 00:39:00.582]  It's like creating Al Qaeda.
[00:39:00.862 --> 00:39:02.162]  They're not just infiltrating it.
[00:39:02.843 --> 00:39:04.063]  It's full spectrum dominance.
[00:39:04.443 --> 00:39:09.766]  They're creating and controlling all points on the compass so they can control the outcome.
[00:39:11.024 --> 00:39:17.227]  Right, it's just like the FBI now setting up these people who are supposedly Muslims.
[00:39:18.707 --> 00:39:21.089]  They're saying, you know, we're playing some sort of an attack.
[00:39:21.429 --> 00:39:27.411]  We find out that the FBI is supplying them with the weapons, with the cash, with the, you know, everything.
[00:39:27.451 --> 00:39:35.095]  And this is sort of like engineered from the very beginning by the FBI and they get some dupe or a patsy.
[00:39:35.935 --> 00:39:37.076]  Uh, to go along with it.
[00:39:37.136 --> 00:39:43.382]  And then they charge that individual with some sort of conspiracy to commit some act of terrorism.
[00:39:43.562 --> 00:39:45.303]  It's happening all the time these days.
[00:39:46.444 --> 00:39:51.969]  Wayne, in closing, what are some of the other big stories you're working on right now at WayneMadsenReport.com?
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:40:02.347]  Well, the big story I broke yesterday was the fact that the warrantless NSA wiretapping program still exists.
[00:40:02.407 --> 00:40:07.972]  It's being used to target journalists and elected politicians, primarily.
[00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:21.403]  And because of the revelations about this program, which was codenamed Stellar Wind, by the way, it was never called the terrorist surveillance program.
[00:40:21.443 --> 00:40:22.804]  When Bush got caught doing it,
[00:40:24.463 --> 00:40:29.945]  During his administration, they put the word out, oh, this is called the Terrorist Surveillance Program.
[00:40:29.985 --> 00:40:30.965]  It was never called that.
[00:40:30.985 --> 00:40:32.306]  It was called The Program.
[00:40:33.406 --> 00:40:38.948]  Then they tried to backload the terrorist part into it to say, oh, yeah, but we're doing it to catch terrorists.
[00:40:39.128 --> 00:40:42.068]  They were never using it against terrorists.
[00:40:42.148 --> 00:40:50.551]  I got very good sources on this that said they were using this to go after journalists, people in the government who were leaking information to journalists, and elected politicians
[00:40:51.031 --> 00:40:57.475]  And now since NSA got caught, they've shifted the responsibility and the operations over to the U.S.
[00:40:57.555 --> 00:41:04.839]  Cyber Command, which happens to be also led by the same individual who leads the National Security Agency.
[00:41:05.139 --> 00:41:08.381]  In this case is General Keith Alexander.
[00:41:08.421 --> 00:41:15.825]  So they just moved it over to the cyber surveillance side of the house from the traditional NSA signals intelligence operations.
[00:41:16.499 --> 00:41:18.020]  Which, of course, you worked in the NSA.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:26.346]  Now remember, same thing happened nine years ago when Poindexter, the convicted crook of Iran-Contra, got caught spying on everything.
[00:41:26.386 --> 00:41:28.187]  Our credit card purchases, phone calls.
[00:41:28.487 --> 00:41:29.308]  He was bragging.
[00:41:29.888 --> 00:41:32.670]  So there was a big hubbub because he was bragging to the New York Times.
[00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:42.116]  They were trying to post 9-11, just kind of hide it in plain view and sell the idea of total surveillance, just like they tried to sell torture in the name of fighting terror.
[00:41:42.777 --> 00:41:43.998]  And when he got caught doing it,
[00:41:44.858 --> 00:41:49.140]  They just moved it over to a private group in Virginia, which was just their front.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.122]  So it's always like whack-a-mole, where it just jumps around, Wayne.
[00:41:54.382 --> 00:41:59.945]  Yeah, now we gotta look at Stratfor, too, with this recent release of their emails.
[00:41:59.985 --> 00:42:07.308]  It's very clear that, look, again, it's like the WikiLeaks stuff from the State Department cables.
[00:42:07.648 --> 00:42:09.129]  Look at the material.
[00:42:09.149 --> 00:42:11.810]  A lot of it's based on gossip, hearsay,
[00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:19.659]  Look, even some of the Stratfor emails, the people that were sending in this information, their English was, you know, horrible.
[00:42:19.679 --> 00:42:21.099]  Well, yeah, let me stop you right there.
[00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:29.801]  Isn't Stratfor really just a megaphone to put out Pentagon propaganda so they can act like, look, private intelligence groups are saying this?
[00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:32.141]  Because Stratfor is based here in Austin.
[00:42:32.181 --> 00:42:35.142]  They even had a local radio show on 590 apiece they would do.
[00:42:35.622 --> 00:42:39.603]  And I would listen, and it just sounded like propaganda, not real intelligence.
[00:42:40.163 --> 00:42:45.325]  But then, looking at these emails, it's like big news and Politico and everywhere today.
[00:42:45.746 --> 00:42:48.487]  Oh my gosh, there was a sealed indictment against Assange.
[00:42:48.827 --> 00:42:51.848]  You said that on my show eight, nine, ten months ago.
[00:42:52.148 --> 00:42:55.550]  Then I saw it in papers, mainstream papers.
[00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:03.033]  All Stratford was doing was reporting on what was already in the news and now the media is like, it's a private intelligence group.
[00:43:03.353 --> 00:43:06.695]  It's like God said it because it was in an email and
[00:43:07.665 --> 00:43:11.850]  You read it, it's just a bunch of, uh, a bunch of garbledy-gook.
[00:43:13.392 --> 00:43:19.660]  Yeah, and they fed this stuff directly into networks like CNN and Fox, uh, would pick up on that.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.382]  We know who their subscribers are now.
[00:43:21.903 --> 00:43:26.709]  And, and basically it's, it's the old mighty Wurlitzer where the CIA used to
[00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:29.059]  ...stuff directly to the media.
[00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:31.380]  They even had reporters on their payroll.
[00:43:32.701 --> 00:43:55.293]  The mighty Wurlitzer was to put this stuff out there, this information, and it looks like it's just been privatized and given off to companies like Stratfor, and also remember Blackwater had its own intelligence operation, Total Information Systems, which did the same type of thing.
[00:43:56.073 --> 00:43:59.056]  By the way, they just popped in my ear, Rob Dew.
[00:44:00.277 --> 00:44:07.183]  I've been out of town for a week and a half, and he just told me I was mentioned in a Stratford email.
[00:44:07.223 --> 00:44:08.304]  Come on in here, Dew.
[00:44:09.625 --> 00:44:16.752]  Because I saw some YouTube comments going, Jones, you know, they call you a kook in Stratford, and then I just didn't even believe that.
[00:44:17.913 --> 00:44:22.437]  And then now you just, next time you hear this, tell me, come in on the air, tell people what
[00:44:22.597 --> 00:44:24.698]  We put it in on your desk this morning.
[00:44:24.718 --> 00:44:26.959]  It was during the Osama Bin Laden death.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:35.584]  And they were saying, basically, I wish they would put this to bed and tell the truth so crazies like Glenn Beck and Alex Jones stop complaining.
[00:44:36.104 --> 00:44:38.305]  So that's basically what they said in the email.
[00:44:38.366 --> 00:44:40.687]  Oh wow, so they called me a crazy.
[00:44:40.727 --> 00:44:41.987]  Pretty much, yeah.
[00:44:42.047 --> 00:44:43.868]  And then the guy sent us more.
[00:44:43.908 --> 00:44:45.229]  We got this from a listener this morning.
[00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:45.689]  You know what?
[00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:50.072]  I'm going to challenge Dr. Friedman, because I've asked him on like 20 times over the years, literally.
[00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:51.991]  I've asked them.
[00:44:52.171 --> 00:44:53.992]  Oh, we're going to send our reporters down there.
[00:44:54.032 --> 00:44:54.412]  That's it.
[00:44:54.852 --> 00:44:56.232]  Because I am sick and tired.
[00:44:56.272 --> 00:44:56.812]  Oh, here it is.
[00:44:57.072 --> 00:44:57.553]  Lunatics.
[00:44:57.613 --> 00:44:58.013]  I'm sorry.
[00:44:58.053 --> 00:45:00.993]  OK, well, next time something I'm in WikiLeaks stuff, please.
[00:45:01.334 --> 00:45:03.854]  Yeah, I know it's on your desk and we actually had it.
[00:45:03.874 --> 00:45:04.334]  No, I know.
[00:45:04.374 --> 00:45:05.134]  I'm not mad at you.
[00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:06.375]  I just there's so much here.
[00:45:06.535 --> 00:45:07.215]  Yeah.
[00:45:07.255 --> 00:45:08.975]  Sorry, Wayne, breaking stuff here on air.
[00:45:09.356 --> 00:45:09.976]  What is where am I?
[00:45:11.536 --> 00:45:14.317]  The government needs to make body pics available.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:25.436]  Like the MX's do on OBL's pants pulled down to shut down lunatics like Alex Jones and Glenn Beck.
[00:45:26.818 --> 00:45:28.981]  That was, I guess, around the time Bin Laden was killed.
[00:45:29.807 --> 00:45:31.328]  That had to be like a couple days after.
[00:45:31.808 --> 00:45:36.811]  But they were reporting that they were getting intelligence that he was being taken to Dover Air Force Base.
[00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:40.814]  No, no, I saw WikiLeaks saying that he was really... That's all bull!
[00:45:40.974 --> 00:45:46.077]  They put out fake intelligence to argue the other intelligence is wrong, so you believe the general story.
[00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:50.319]  Just like they said, okay, he wasn't in a firefight, he didn't use his wife as a shield.
[00:45:50.659 --> 00:45:51.520]  They add all that.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.541]  Well, okay, but the main story's true.
[00:45:53.581 --> 00:45:54.041]  It's murky.
[00:45:54.061 --> 00:45:55.802]  And then they blow the SEALs up in the aircraft.
[00:45:55.822 --> 00:45:56.182]  Good job.
[00:45:56.222 --> 00:45:56.522]  Thank you.
[00:45:57.342 --> 00:45:57.663]  Thank you.
[00:45:57.683 --> 00:45:58.543]  Just breaking news here.
[00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:02.805]  Now, Wayne, you know, live newsroom here with this stuff happening as we do this interview.
[00:46:05.046 --> 00:46:07.167]  I talked to a current Navy SEAL.
[00:46:07.668 --> 00:46:08.328]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:46:08.348 --> 00:46:10.649]  I don't want to give out too much data or they'll be able to figure out who it is.
[00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.951]  And let's just say known to my family for a decade.
[00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:16.584]  Well, his dad is.
[00:46:16.864 --> 00:46:27.389]  And he's not in SEAL Team 6, but he said the SEALs do believe that helicopter, the second one that blew up, with the 20-something SEALs on it, was a hit.
[00:46:28.089 --> 00:46:31.951]  And now I was actually given the number to Navy SEALs, and I've been so busy I haven't gotten in touch with them.
[00:46:32.252 --> 00:46:35.413]  They're saying they're being told to get ready for another stage false flag.
[00:46:35.854 --> 00:46:39.816]  Remember Cheney, four years ago, five years ago, tried to have the SEALs attack U.S.
[00:46:39.856 --> 00:46:40.096]  ships.
[00:46:40.116 --> 00:46:40.496]  Remember that?
[00:46:40.516 --> 00:46:42.117]  Right, right.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:47:00.087]  Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, I was told by a source with SEAL Team 6, or SEAL Team 2, Navy SEAL Team 2, that it was definitely, they thought that that chopper was taken down to eliminate witnesses.
[00:47:00.147 --> 00:47:08.030]  Now we have the compound in Abbottabad being razed to the ground, and then when they're doing that, they find two English language Bibles
[00:47:08.911 --> 00:47:16.457]  Where the supposedly Obama, I'm sorry I did that, Osama Bin Laden had these secret codes.
[00:47:16.818 --> 00:47:22.803]  Now why would a guy who's a Saudi Arab be putting secret codes in an English language holy Bible?
[00:47:23.403 --> 00:47:27.567]  The whole thing smells, I mean it's ridiculous at face value.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.183]  And I, you know, but of course the media went and reported that nonsense.
[00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:33.143]  I agree with you.
[00:47:33.163 --> 00:47:46.793]  I think Stratfor, back when there was the 2000 coup against Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, I was contacted by a Stratfor person who was really interested in where my sources were that the CIA was involved with that coup.
[00:47:47.374 --> 00:47:49.856]  And of course I didn't give him any information.
[00:47:50.656 --> 00:48:08.850]  But he thought it was important that I find out that after I was quoted on that in a couple of newspapers, including the Guardian out of the UK and the Boston Globe, that Bush at his President's Daily Brief basically said,
[00:48:10.655 --> 00:48:19.699]  You know, blankety-blank whole think he is, talking about me, and he wanted to know what I thought of that, and I said, hey, if it's Bush that said it, I can just consider the source.
[00:48:19.759 --> 00:48:36.046]  So, Stratfor has always been involved in sort of this kind of media manipulation, which I see as just nothing more than a follow-on to Cord Myers and Frank Wisner, Senior's Mighty Wurlitzer operator.
[00:48:36.086 --> 00:48:36.286]  Sure.
[00:48:36.946 --> 00:48:54.659]  In closing, now that I've been given this WikiLeak that I'm in where I'm being called a lunatic along with Glenn Beck by these guys, that shows that Glenn Beck's fallen out of favor with them because he'll actually expose, you know, more of the left-right paradigm and how behind the scenes it's all run by the same group.
[00:48:54.699 --> 00:48:58.882]  As I've now confirmed from Fox sources, he was run out because he was going after Soros.
[00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:00.062]  He was told, shut up.
[00:49:00.483 --> 00:49:03.545]  And to his credit, even though I don't particularly like Beck, he's done some stuff to me behind the scenes,
[00:49:03.925 --> 00:49:04.085]  Yeah.
[00:49:16.189 --> 00:49:19.653]  I mean, because obviously Stratfor is bad news, but then you're right.
[00:49:19.853 --> 00:49:24.137]  WikiLeaks is fed info that certain groups like Soros want out.
[00:49:24.618 --> 00:49:27.981]  So there's different camps here, but now they're getting ready to burn Assange.
[00:49:28.021 --> 00:49:29.803]  I'm not saying he's a CIA agent.
[00:49:30.184 --> 00:49:32.766]  I've always said he's being used as the front.
[00:49:32.827 --> 00:49:33.728]  I know you've said that.
[00:49:34.208 --> 00:49:38.232]  So in summation, why would the system want to burn Stratfor?
[00:49:39.915 --> 00:49:42.076]  I mean, I understand it's not good guy, bad guy.
[00:49:42.457 --> 00:49:45.438]  It's more like different arms of the same structure fighting with each other.
[00:49:45.779 --> 00:49:51.162]  What do you think is going on between anonymous WikiLeaks and this Stratfor group?
[00:49:52.478 --> 00:49:54.299]  Well, you know, I think you're right.
[00:49:54.319 --> 00:50:02.202]  It could be various factions because the CIA is not a, you know, this monolithic organization.
[00:50:02.242 --> 00:50:09.744]  You've got a bunch of retirees from different administrations with different axes to grind.
[00:50:10.205 --> 00:50:12.626]  You've got the George H.W.
[00:50:12.666 --> 00:50:13.426]  Bush people.
[00:50:13.446 --> 00:50:19.108]  You've got the old agency people who were brought in by Stanfield Turner under Carter.
[00:50:19.868 --> 00:50:20.348]  You've got the
[00:50:22.049 --> 00:50:23.250]  People came in under Clinton.
[00:50:23.531 --> 00:50:28.496]  So they're all like, you know, none of them are singing from the same song sheet, certainly.
[00:50:28.997 --> 00:50:33.001]  And they could be linking stuff to various entities.
[00:50:34.743 --> 00:50:37.185]  But I put Stratford in the same category.
[00:50:37.226 --> 00:50:39.308]  There's an Israeli website called Debka.
[00:50:39.668 --> 00:50:40.668]  Yeah.
[00:50:41.188 --> 00:50:43.329]  Which does the same thing for the Mossad.
[00:50:43.649 --> 00:50:52.571]  And then there's a Stratford thing where they say, oh, the Israelis working with Kurdish guerrillas destroyed all of Iran's nuclear facilities.
[00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:58.913]  Well, anyone who believes that, you know, I mean, you know, would believe in the East.
[00:50:59.393 --> 00:51:00.653]  It's obviously some sort of
[00:51:01.346 --> 00:51:01.887]  I think so.
[00:51:15.819 --> 00:51:16.820]  Right, right.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:44.996]  So, you see, I mean, but the problem is, of course, that this lickspittle media, this group of stenographers out there, they pick up on everything and run it as... Well, there's this idea that, ooh, Stratfor, you know, I mean, I can start a group called Geniusor, even more awesomer, you know, it's, oh, oh my God, and you're right, it's a bunch of, you know, crusty guys and they're picking their nose, just like, just calling people lunatics and just spewing garbage up.
[00:51:46.212 --> 00:51:47.153]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:47.494 --> 00:51:56.086]  I never much put any faith in Stratfor after my encounter with them over the Chavez coup, the coup against Hugo Chavez in 2008.
[00:51:56.226 --> 00:51:56.667]  Exactly.
[00:51:56.727 --> 00:51:57.568]  I've got to be honest.
[00:51:57.688 --> 00:52:01.433]  I know Debka is an Israeli front, probably even Shembet domestically.
[00:52:02.134 --> 00:52:06.237]  But I found overall their stuff turns out to be more accurate than Stratfor.
[00:52:06.478 --> 00:52:09.860]  Because, you know, they were admitting that, yeah, they're using Al-Qaeda to attack Libya.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.863]  Yeah, you know, there's three groups invading Syria.
[00:52:13.143 --> 00:52:14.264]  This is going to happen in a few months.
[00:52:14.624 --> 00:52:16.606]  I found DEPCA has actually been pretty accurate.
[00:52:18.072 --> 00:52:27.260]  Yeah, they're probably a little more professional when it comes to this type of, you know, program than the clowns of the CIA are.
[00:52:28.241 --> 00:52:36.288]  But I think, you know, this is an information war, as you use the term correctly.
[00:52:36.629 --> 00:52:37.750]  It's an information war.
[00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:43.495]  And that's, and we're in a, you know, it's now pretty much a hot war with anonymous and
[00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:57.074]  And Wikileaks and all these other entities out there putting this information out on the Internet because it's like, let's say, it's basically a Carl Rosel paradigm.
[00:52:57.275 --> 00:53:02.080]  You throw something on the wall and see what sticks, whether it's true or not.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:07.561]  And overall it just creates a fog of war meant to confuse those that aren't that informed.
[00:53:07.801 --> 00:53:10.622]  That's why all I know is we're losing our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:53:11.042 --> 00:53:12.082]  I want my freedom back.
[00:53:12.262 --> 00:53:13.262]  I want my country back.
[00:53:13.502 --> 00:53:16.763]  And I'm against anybody who isn't for freedom and wants to take our liberties.
[00:53:17.103 --> 00:53:18.143]  And my job's simple.
[00:53:18.503 --> 00:53:19.263]  I'm an American.
[00:53:19.623 --> 00:53:21.464]  I'm an Info Warrior who stands for liberty.
[00:53:21.884 --> 00:53:24.064]  And I know that Wayne Madsen stands for that as well.
[00:53:24.384 --> 00:53:25.785]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:53:25.825 --> 00:53:26.685]  Thank you so much, Wayne.
[00:53:27.759 --> 00:53:28.500]  Better be with you, Alex.
[00:53:55.987 --> 00:53:57.587]  Okay, yeah, here's what was on my desk.
[00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:58.268]  Oh, there's more?
[00:53:58.288 --> 00:54:00.048]  There's a whole bunch of this?
[00:54:00.168 --> 00:54:01.028]  It's more on OBL.
[00:54:01.369 --> 00:54:02.129]  Oh my gosh.
[00:54:03.269 --> 00:54:04.509]  No wonder those stretch for guys.
[00:54:04.569 --> 00:54:07.270]  Every time I call to get them on as a guest, we'll never return our phone call.
[00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:08.391]  That's it!
[00:54:09.151 --> 00:54:10.531]  Next week, go down there.
[00:54:10.551 --> 00:54:12.732]  Isn't it downtown?
[00:54:12.752 --> 00:54:20.534]  Probably a bunch of guys literally just sitting there with chimpanzees at typewriters randomly typing stuff the way this is written.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.461]  Anyways, at least here we try to get it right and actually do some research, you know?
[00:54:26.761 --> 00:54:27.881]  That's why we've been so accurate.
[00:54:28.241 --> 00:54:29.302]  You want real intelligence?
[00:54:29.342 --> 00:54:31.442]  We're giving it to you just through open source research.
[00:54:31.722 --> 00:54:32.942]  And any of you can do it.
[00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:34.943]  Just use your common sense.
[00:54:35.163 --> 00:54:35.803]  Oh my gosh.
[00:54:38.244 --> 00:54:42.985]  Here's a little promo for the speech I gave in Dallas, Blueprint to Defeat the New World Order.
[00:54:43.285 --> 00:54:44.085]  I gotta be honest.
[00:54:45.034 --> 00:54:46.274]  I think it was a really good speech.
[00:54:46.314 --> 00:54:50.535]  I give it an A that I gave, but everybody told me the one in Orlando was an A+.
[00:54:50.575 --> 00:54:52.015]  So it's a great speech.
[00:54:53.076 --> 00:54:53.616]  It's coming up.
[00:54:53.636 --> 00:54:54.516]  I mean, I gave the speech.
[00:54:54.556 --> 00:54:59.717]  I haven't seen this video yet, but this is the high quality shoot of it for you, the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:54:59.757 --> 00:55:04.758]  That's coming up after Aaron Dykes comes in and interviews Cindy Sheehan.
[00:55:05.418 --> 00:55:08.299]  And then we'll air my hour and a half speech in total.
[00:55:09.079 --> 00:55:10.139]  I didn't see much of it.
[00:55:10.159 --> 00:55:11.140]  I just saw you guys editing it.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.660]  Did we add any of the question and answer?
[00:55:13.669 --> 00:55:16.390]  All those folks talking about how the InfoWars saves lives, huh?
[00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:19.071]  Your mic's not on.
[00:55:20.232 --> 00:55:22.213]  I tell you, every day the equipment changes in there.
[00:55:22.513 --> 00:55:23.973]  I think we have like 18 gremlins.
[00:55:23.993 --> 00:55:26.014]  I think there's like a gremlin breeding hive.
[00:55:26.054 --> 00:55:26.414]  Go ahead.
[00:55:27.315 --> 00:55:28.075]  Still can't hear you.
[00:55:28.175 --> 00:55:28.515]  Whatever.
[00:55:28.935 --> 00:55:31.456]  Who knows if there's question and answer in it.
[00:55:31.737 --> 00:55:32.077]  Yes!
[00:55:32.557 --> 00:55:33.877]  Three times the charm!
[00:55:34.658 --> 00:55:37.339]  Maybe if it wasn't so dark in there, you guys could see something.
[00:55:38.254 --> 00:55:39.136]  Talk about gremlins.
[00:55:39.156 --> 00:55:40.159]  Maybe you're the gremlins.
[00:55:40.961 --> 00:55:42.926]  I notice the more of you are in there, the worse things go.
[00:55:43.107 --> 00:55:44.470]  It's like... I'm just joking.
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:52.741]  Oh, it was so dark during the question and answer.
[00:55:52.961 --> 00:55:53.342]  It's fine.
[00:55:53.382 --> 00:55:55.563]  Let's put that out as a separate deal, because I thought that was even cooler.
[00:55:55.843 --> 00:55:56.984]  Anyways, great job, crew.
[00:55:58.004 --> 00:56:04.969]  And we'll be right back with Aaron Dykes and then the entirety of the speech that I gave in Dallas a week and a half ago.
[00:56:04.989 --> 00:56:06.570]  It's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:14.494]  If you're not a subscriber, it is those of you out there that are subscribers that are financing this, paying it forward for the millions that watch it every week, free on the web.
[00:56:14.755 --> 00:56:19.297]  You see it when you're a member here first, all the films, nine years now up and running for presentplanet.tv.
[00:56:20.638 --> 00:56:23.101]  And we got a 15-day free trial going right now.
[00:56:23.461 --> 00:56:35.555]  And if you are watching this out there on the web later, please think about becoming a subscriber so we can continue to expand our operations in the face of the New World Order's assaults, both InfoWars-wise and physical.
[00:56:36.136 --> 00:56:39.600]  All right, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.101]  Stay with us.
[00:56:43.046 --> 00:56:49.591]  America, right here at this center place where we live, make no mistake, is where the battle will be fought.
[00:56:49.871 --> 00:56:51.993]  It's where the decisions will be made.
[00:56:52.273 --> 00:56:57.157]  We are the great evil empire, but we are also the great deliverer from the tyranny.
[00:56:57.337 --> 00:56:59.699]  But we have to decide who we are!
[00:57:01.058 --> 00:57:02.179]  We have the power!
[00:57:02.479 --> 00:57:08.664]  What would make these criminals put poisons in our food and water to try to blind us and fog our vision?
[00:57:09.064 --> 00:57:10.706]  Because they're scared of you.
[00:57:11.186 --> 00:57:13.448]  The crooks know how humans work.
[00:57:13.768 --> 00:57:16.971]  They know the secret of humanity, but they seek to hide it.
[00:57:17.391 --> 00:57:20.093]  They seek to block you from ever fully developing.
[00:57:20.433 --> 00:57:24.797]  They seek to block you from ever becoming who you really are because they're scared of you.
[00:57:25.137 --> 00:57:26.258]  And always remember that.
[00:57:26.318 --> 00:57:27.058]  That's the secret.
[00:57:27.879 --> 00:57:35.166]  There was so much we didn't get to, so much that we couldn't cover, so much that we couldn't show you, how much crisis this world is in.
[00:57:36.628 --> 00:57:41.833]  Now with that said, I've given you the blueprint of madmen.
[00:57:41.853 --> 00:57:46.057]  I want to give you the blueprint to defeat the New World Order.
[00:57:50.106 --> 00:57:52.267]  Evil is coming down on our children.
[00:57:52.868 --> 00:57:54.548]  Evil is coming down on our communities.
[00:57:54.909 --> 00:58:01.632]  Evil is coming down on us with all their plagues, and all their disease, and all their corruption that they gain power out of.
[00:58:01.912 --> 00:58:08.616]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:58:08.876 --> 00:58:10.977]  You better believe you got one!
[00:58:17.187 --> 00:58:25.513]  One is a serial hypocrite who lobbied for Freddie Mac before the housing crisis and for the individual mandate before Obamacare.
[00:58:26.194 --> 00:58:33.639]  Another, a counterfeit conservative who opposes right to work, massively increased spending, and funded Planned Parenthood.
[00:58:33.979 --> 00:58:41.444]  Finally, a flip-flopper who's been on all sides, supported TARP bailouts, and provided the blueprint for Obamacare.
[00:58:41.844 --> 00:58:42.285]  Three men.
[00:58:43.106 --> 00:58:43.748]  One vision.
[00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.951]  More big government.
[00:58:45.533 --> 00:58:46.455]  More mandates.
[00:58:46.837 --> 00:58:47.538]  Less freedom.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:53.183]  One man stands apart, ready to deliver real change.
[00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:58.626]  Voting against every tax increase and every unbalanced budget, every time.
[00:58:58.926 --> 00:59:04.529]  A real plan to cut a trillion dollars year one and to balance the budget in three.
[00:59:04.889 --> 00:59:05.510]  Pro-life.
[00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:06.710]  Pro-liberty.
[00:59:07.231 --> 00:59:10.232]  Guided by faith and principle, Ron Paul.
[00:59:10.633 --> 00:59:13.474]  The one who will restore America now.
[00:59:14.395 --> 00:59:16.336]  I'm Ron Paul and I approve this message.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.541]  And it's time to get out of the comfort zone.
[00:59:46.581 --> 00:59:49.023]  Because these people aren't playing games.
[00:59:49.343 --> 01:00:02.474]  We're gonna organize.
[01:00:02.674 --> 01:00:04.335]  Humanity's gonna come together.
[01:00:05.616 --> 01:00:07.257]  We are swinging muskets here.
[01:00:07.557 --> 01:00:09.039]  Toe-to-toe with the globalists.
[01:00:09.059 --> 01:00:09.879]  They're bloodied.
[01:00:09.979 --> 01:00:10.680]  We're bloodied.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.062]  It is absolute total.
[01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:33.571]  We are back on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:36.052]  Now, we had an interview scheduled with Cindy Sheehan.
[01:00:36.072 --> 01:00:41.473]  She contacted us just a few minutes ago to let us know that something came up, so she's unable to make it today.
[01:00:41.874 --> 01:00:52.137]  I'm sure we'll talk to her again in the future, but she is, of course, being pursued by the IRS for not paying back taxes, which she openly didn't pay in protest of the wars going on.
[01:00:52.637 --> 01:00:58.099]  Of course, her son Casey was killed, and she's been protesting against the illegal wars ever since.
[01:00:58.779 --> 01:01:00.260]  We appreciate her standing up.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:00.880]  Yes.
[01:01:20.896 --> 01:01:23.657]  Opposition to Obama leading into the reelection.
[01:01:24.278 --> 01:01:25.418]  I think it's an important question.
[01:01:25.858 --> 01:01:36.124]  Anyway, you're not losing any real content tonight on the news because we have a special presentation of Alex's speech in Dallas, Texas on his blueprint to defeat the New World Order.
[01:01:36.164 --> 01:01:38.145]  Speaking to her, it's a great speech.
[01:01:38.525 --> 01:01:40.826]  I've watched Alex almost every day on air for more than
[01:01:41.626 --> 01:01:49.151]  Six years and I think his best moments are still captured during his live speaking events and so it's great if you can come out to see him.
[01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:55.454]  For those who can't, you can watch it on the recording even though in some ways you don't capture the same energy.
[01:01:55.854 --> 01:02:03.779]  Nonetheless, a lot of important points came up and in the question and answer sessions, many interesting stories come forward, people who cured themselves,
[01:02:04.059 --> 01:02:04.459]  Thank you so much.
[01:02:34.025 --> 01:02:34.285]  Good night.
[01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:48.034]  I know the gentleman that you guys are here for, the Mario Andretti, the Rock, all rolled into one.
[01:02:49.235 --> 01:02:51.236]  It's time for Alex Jones!
[01:02:57.267 --> 01:03:00.430]  Now look at all these articles and documents and notes I've got.
[01:03:00.471 --> 01:03:02.613]  Hell, I've got to do a good job with all you great people out here.
[01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:10.021]  You know, like I said earlier when I introduced that documentary we just showed, I am humbled by meeting you.
[01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:11.983]  I'm humbled by talking to you.
[01:03:12.023 --> 01:03:15.046]  And I know that it's in people like you that we're going to turn this around.
[01:03:18.888 --> 01:03:19.989]  Because we don't have a choice.
[01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:22.451]  How many times have we been lied to?
[01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:37.245]  How many times have we caught the system doing everything it can, not just to rob us, but to try to ruin our lives so that we're weak and poor and dominated by them so they can control our destiny?
[01:03:37.526 --> 01:03:38.286]  I don't like that!
[01:03:38.587 --> 01:03:40.709]  I want to see humanity doing well!
[01:03:47.307 --> 01:03:49.109]  I want to see humanity empowered.
[01:03:49.930 --> 01:04:01.402]  You know, my dad's a dentist, and at least once a year for more than 20 years, he's gone to Latin America to be part of these free clinics for these different doctors' organizations to take care of kids.
[01:04:01.862 --> 01:04:06.407]  And he's told me the same stories that my uncle told me, who did years of work as a missionary.
[01:04:06.966 --> 01:04:24.123]  in Central and South America, and he said, you know, you don't appreciate life, even though my uncle was in Vietnam, a helicopter pilot, until you see children at orphanages where the orphanages don't even have the money to pay for food, and there's little kids with their ribcages sticking out.
[01:04:24.984 --> 01:04:26.025]  That's what we're talking about.
[01:04:26.065 --> 01:04:29.828]  You have to realize, I have to realize, and really let it burn into our brains
[01:04:30.694 --> 01:04:42.986]  That more than 15 million children, according to the UN, in their own numbers, it's probably higher, 15 million children a year starve to death on this planet.
[01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:46.409]  And another 20 million adults.
[01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:54.978]  And our corrupt, stinking, corporate, fascist government pays farmers not to produce food!
[01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:06.001]  And it's not just that they're trying to protect our markets, then you find out that they've got all these endless white papers, as many as you could ever read.
[01:05:06.641 --> 01:05:17.444]  Every day, Aaron Dykes doing research, and others in my crew bring in, this is on the Rockefeller Foundation, this is on the Carnegie Foundation, this is on the Ford Foundation, here's a Planned Parenthood document, oh, where is it?
[01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:26.586]  It's on, you know, this university site, Archive, talking about how in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, we gotta shut food off to people to kill them!
[01:05:28.015 --> 01:05:30.476]  And then some people say, well, there are too many people.
[01:05:30.736 --> 01:05:38.259]  I love the yuppies that'll say, well, okay, there is a population control agenda, but there are too many of those people.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.060]  And I'm like, don't you get it?
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.761]  You little jackass bastard.
[01:05:43.141 --> 01:05:50.324]  You, you think you're part of the system, your water, your food, your vaccines.
[01:05:50.564 --> 01:05:52.545]  It's all jacked with the same stuff.
[01:05:52.765 --> 01:05:54.066]  You little piece of crap.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:07.587]  There is nothing more pathetic than some coward who is so cowardly, they play like a little dress-up game in their mind.
[01:06:07.607 --> 01:06:09.749]  A little make-believe game in their mind.
[01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:14.053]  That they're part of the winning team because they go along with all this.
[01:06:14.474 --> 01:06:16.816]  That it's like some kind of open joke.
[01:06:17.296 --> 01:06:18.738]  Like it's some type of game.
[01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:37.850]  I've had so-called establishment types, it's always somebody who's worth like $50 million and thinks they're part of the elite when that ain't even middle class or the globalists, who'll come up to me and say, well Alex, you know, maybe 9-11 is an inside job, but you know it takes things like that to get the people doing what they're supposed to.
[01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:47.356]  Like this sack of garbage thinks they're part of the system because they can understand false flag terror and understand that's what it takes to defend America.
[01:06:47.776 --> 01:06:47.916]  No.
[01:06:48.897 --> 01:06:52.661]  If they did evil things like that to defeat evil, it'd be evil.
[01:06:52.681 --> 01:06:57.385]  Because you can't become evil to defeat evil, like the ring of Sauron in Lord of the Rings.
[01:06:57.665 --> 01:06:58.646]  Doesn't work that way.
[01:06:58.946 --> 01:07:01.309]  But they're not using evil to defeat evil.
[01:07:01.469 --> 01:07:03.451]  They're not even following that fallacy.
[01:07:03.711 --> 01:07:06.834]  They have given themselves totally over to it.
[01:07:07.114 --> 01:07:12.959]  The globalists compete with each other to see who is the most wicked and ruthless.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:21.484]  And in that process, have become total madmen as I documented in this earlier presentation that you saw.
[01:07:21.844 --> 01:07:23.405]  And that was only the tip of the iceberg.
[01:07:24.186 --> 01:07:34.731]  Our problem in compiling that 40 minutes was that there was so much we didn't get to, so much that we couldn't cover, so much that we couldn't show you how much crisis this world is in.
[01:07:36.212 --> 01:07:39.514]  Now with that said, I've given you the blueprint
[01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:45.619]  of Mad Men, I want to give you the blueprint to defeat the New World Order.
[01:07:54.807 --> 01:08:01.110]  This world's engineers, the controllers of this planet, always seek to teach you that resources are finite.
[01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:06.052]  They always seek to teach you that for you to win, somebody else has got to lose.
[01:08:06.593 --> 01:08:08.714]  They know full well that's not how this world works.
[01:08:09.154 --> 01:08:11.415]  That we have unlimited potential.
[01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:13.436]  That we're made in the image of the Creator.
[01:08:13.616 --> 01:08:17.618]  Whether you believe in that or not, humankind has given us Beethoven, literature,
[01:08:18.158 --> 01:08:20.619]  They've given us all of the science, all of the beauty.
[01:08:21.099 --> 01:08:23.320]  They've given us people like Whitney Houston's voice.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.621]  All the things that are in humanity.
[01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:26.681]  All the good.
[01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:35.285]  And it's by recognizing that good and that potential, and by reaching for what's good and empowers us, that we have hope for the future.
[01:08:35.905 --> 01:08:41.948]  Our ancestors, and God knows they weren't perfect, understood sacrifice and standing up for what's right.
[01:08:42.188 --> 01:08:44.849]  And that's the only reason we're here today.
[01:08:45.249 --> 01:08:47.450]  Why do you think the United States
[01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:51.651]  Such a small area, geographically, for the land surface of this planet.
[01:08:53.412 --> 01:08:57.753]  And only 4.5% of the world's population.
[01:08:58.433 --> 01:08:57.753]  100%.
[01:08:59.294 --> 01:08:59.634]  7 million.
[01:09:00.074 --> 01:09:04.835]  The United States is 4.5 or 4.9, depending on which actuary you look at.
[01:09:05.136 --> 01:09:08.417]  But less than 5% of the world's population.
[01:09:08.797 --> 01:09:15.559]  Why did the United States, with less than 5% of the world's population, have more than half the wealth of the world?
[01:09:17.389 --> 01:09:17.789]  Freedom!
[01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:21.730]  And it doesn't mean that our higher level of freedom was perfect.
[01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:24.130]  Doesn't mean that there was an injustice.
[01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:25.731]  Didn't mean that there weren't problems.
[01:09:25.951 --> 01:09:41.154]  But compared to every other place in the world, we didn't have the corrupt elites on top of us, trying to shut down human destiny, shut down human ingenuity and creativity, because they're threatened by it, because they want a monopoly.
[01:09:41.494 --> 01:09:44.555]  Because the United States only had a few glimmers
[01:09:44.995 --> 01:09:49.037]  And moments of freedom, we developed the highest test scores.
[01:09:49.137 --> 01:09:51.418]  We developed the most scientific developments.
[01:09:51.658 --> 01:09:57.701]  We created the media and the literature and the art and the music that has conquered the world.
[01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:02.824]  And the globalists, the global scientific engineers saw that.
[01:10:03.124 --> 01:10:04.224]  They were aware of that.
[01:10:04.544 --> 01:10:05.405]  They knew that.
[01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:11.448]  And so they did everything they could to take that over and to take our energies and turn it against humanity.
[01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.509]  So now America is in a paradox.
[01:10:14.429 --> 01:10:21.013]  America, right here at this center place where we live, make no mistake, is where the battle will be fought.
[01:10:21.293 --> 01:10:23.434]  It's where the decisions will be made.
[01:10:23.714 --> 01:10:28.577]  We are the great evil empire, but we are also the great deliverer from the tyranny.
[01:10:28.777 --> 01:10:31.139]  But we have to decide who we are!
[01:10:37.694 --> 01:10:42.117]  That's why the struggle between good and evil is being decided here.
[01:10:42.858 --> 01:10:45.320]  Because we have the birthright of liberty.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.642]  Because we have the basic freedom.
[01:10:47.882 --> 01:10:52.325]  Because we are armed like no other nation on earth!
[01:10:52.685 --> 01:10:55.127]  The globalists have not taken this republic!
[01:10:55.147 --> 01:11:02.133]  All right, I've never been able to do this on the radio.
[01:11:02.193 --> 01:11:06.316]  I can never get to the second point without going off into rant.
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:13.723]  It may be a bad speech, it may be the best ever, but I'm going to attempt, with your help, to go through all these points.
[01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:27.931]  Alright, I'll start at the top.
[01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.753]  Again, I want to thank you all for being here.
[01:11:37.699 --> 01:11:42.643]  I want to thank my crew, but I also want to thank all of you.
[01:11:42.663 --> 01:11:45.245]  I love that Teddy Roosevelt quote.
[01:11:45.285 --> 01:11:50.029]  I should have had it here so I could quote it properly, but forget the critic, the person who's not in the arena.
[01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:54.453]  What matters is the person who is in the arena, who knows the great challenges, the great struggles.
[01:11:54.993 --> 01:11:57.936]  Because even if you fail, at least you tried to dare greatly.
[01:11:58.436 --> 01:11:59.177]  That's what matters.
[01:11:59.637 --> 01:12:00.298]  It's trying.
[01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:02.760]  That's where it all starts, is taking action.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.001]  That's what's fulfilling.
[01:12:07.779 --> 01:12:18.007]  And I want to say this to you here now, because I was told several times last week and again today that I am the 21st century Paul Revere.
[01:12:18.207 --> 01:12:24.491]  And I said, no, you are the 21st century Paul Revere.
[01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.336]  And this is not a battle.
[01:12:31.465 --> 01:12:37.433]  This is not a war against the undefeated British Imperial Redcoats, who'd never been defeated.
[01:12:38.495 --> 01:12:42.861]  And George Washington lost almost every battle for five years, but they persevered.
[01:12:43.322 --> 01:12:45.024]  It was the continuing to fight.
[01:12:45.465 --> 01:12:47.368]  It was the resistance that was the victory.
[01:12:48.319 --> 01:12:50.222]  And that's why the system attacks that victory.
[01:12:50.482 --> 01:12:51.283]  Because it hates it.
[01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:55.930]  Anything the new world order attacks, you better believe that's where the liberty is.
[01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:56.751]  That's where the freedom is.
[01:12:56.791 --> 01:12:57.512]  That's what's good.
[01:12:58.133 --> 01:13:02.278]  Not because it's perfect, but like King David of the Bible, the heart is right.
[01:13:02.919 --> 01:13:03.821]  That's what matters.
[01:13:04.101 --> 01:13:05.022]  None of us are perfect.
[01:13:05.603 --> 01:13:09.447]  And the system will try to tell us how we're bad and how we're impure and how we're not good.
[01:13:09.967 --> 01:13:10.788]  None of that matters.
[01:13:11.148 --> 01:13:12.910]  It's our hearts that matter.
[01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:14.591]  It's what we stand for.
[01:13:14.852 --> 01:13:18.335]  It's who we are in the final equation that matters.
[01:13:19.977 --> 01:13:25.339]  Do we serve light, or do we serve the murdering, destructive darkness?
[01:13:25.879 --> 01:13:30.480]  That's the question that you must decide, and it's a decision you must make!
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:39.203]  The system tells you there's not that decision, because that decision is there, and that decision is where all the power in this universe resides.
[01:13:39.423 --> 01:13:43.484]  As Martin Luther King said, the universe bends towards justice.
[01:13:43.864 --> 01:13:46.005]  Providence is on the side of justice.
[01:13:49.861 --> 01:14:01.327]  The minute, the second you commit yourself to liberty and freedom and justice, even your body be killed, your spirit truly has victory!
[01:14:08.471 --> 01:14:10.052]  So I say it to you now.
[01:14:11.499 --> 01:14:14.120]  We are all Paul Revere.
[01:14:15.081 --> 01:14:18.163]  And we're not just fighting for freedom in North America.
[01:14:18.483 --> 01:14:18.783]  This is 1776!
[01:14:18.843 --> 01:14:19.303]  Worldwide!
[01:14:27.711 --> 01:14:39.101]  Our Republic's wealth and everything it is and all of its challenges has now been teamed up, pulling the globalist system of enslavement and war and death.
[01:14:39.581 --> 01:14:42.463]  We are now in bondage to pure evil.
[01:14:42.864 --> 01:14:48.288]  Our energies and everything our ancestors built is now slave to this evil.
[01:14:48.509 --> 01:14:50.710]  And we must break the chains of slavery!
[01:14:51.111 --> 01:14:52.492]  We must break them now!
[01:14:52.752 --> 01:14:54.654]  We must declare liberty!
[01:15:03.376 --> 01:15:05.777]  Now those are just the notes up here on the top of the page.
[01:15:07.137 --> 01:15:13.299]  Because, I mean, I'm sitting there writing key points I want to cover, and just thinking, I'm not worthy to bring you this message.
[01:15:13.559 --> 01:15:14.500]  But it doesn't matter!
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.761]  Because it's a mission we must all carry out!
[01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:20.041]  And what matters is that we give 110%!
[01:15:25.987 --> 01:15:36.438]  Now I gave you their blueprint for madness and all the crazy stuff these globalists are doing trying to play God and trying to get the super weapon so they can threaten everybody and get their world government.
[01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:40.683]  And in the process probably destroying us all if we don't turn this around.
[01:15:41.243 --> 01:15:46.068]  But I, on the first point, want to tell you we are winning and I'll get more into it in this speech but
[01:15:47.222 --> 01:15:47.903]  My God!
[01:15:48.783 --> 01:15:54.147]  I remember 17 years ago first getting on radio and TV and people, probably half the people, saying I was crazy.
[01:15:54.727 --> 01:15:56.908]  Totally crazy for having documents, having facts.
[01:15:57.309 --> 01:15:58.550]  I don't hear that now.
[01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:02.892]  I hear almost no one disagree with us on the facts because it's all out in the open.
[01:16:03.133 --> 01:16:04.133]  The enemy's uncloaked.
[01:16:04.173 --> 01:16:06.875]  It's moving in on us a million miles an hour right now.
[01:16:07.215 --> 01:16:10.518]  Instead they say, fine, but you can't do anything about it.
[01:16:11.578 --> 01:16:12.339]  So we've gone
[01:16:13.581 --> 01:16:19.425]  We've gone from denying this is going on to, okay, it's going on, but you can't do anything about it.
[01:16:22.647 --> 01:16:23.187]  That's right.
[01:16:23.968 --> 01:16:24.468]  That's right.
[01:16:25.148 --> 01:16:28.070]  When the enemy comes in, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:32.193]  And I hate to preach at you, but that's just what comes out of me as we face this evil.
[01:16:32.333 --> 01:16:35.995]  Because the New World Order, they believe, and let me tell you what they believe in.
[01:16:36.215 --> 01:16:40.278]  You can give it any name you want, and quite frankly, devil ain't evil enough for it.
[01:16:42.196 --> 01:16:46.919]  Now continuing here, we must develop a blueprint to defeat the New World Order.
[01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:47.939]  We are winning.
[01:16:47.999 --> 01:16:49.300]  We are having victories.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.901]  Because humanity has power.
[01:16:52.302 --> 01:17:00.426]  And real men and women who have power, who have love, who have strength, who have courage, we always are ashamed of our power.
[01:17:00.786 --> 01:17:03.608]  We're always meek and humble in the face of evil.
[01:17:04.128 --> 01:17:06.770]  And we think that it's just our job to lay down to it.
[01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:10.332]  I'm here to tell you, it's time for humanity to stand up.
[01:17:11.584 --> 01:17:15.845]  Because evil, evil is coming down on our children.
[01:17:16.445 --> 01:17:18.125]  Evil is coming down on our communities.
[01:17:18.485 --> 01:17:25.227]  Evil is coming down on us with all their plagues and all their disease and all their corruption that they gain power out of.
[01:17:25.487 --> 01:17:32.188]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:34.549]  You better believe you got one!
[01:17:44.491 --> 01:17:49.835]  I can't tell you, and I'm going to get to this in a moment, how many people tell me, I can't believe you did this or you did that, aren't they going to get you?
[01:17:50.055 --> 01:17:51.336]  Listen, these enemies are weak!
[01:17:52.117 --> 01:17:54.899]  And the minute you don't care if they kill you, they lose all their power!
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.561]  I don't want to die, I love life a lot!
[01:17:57.902 --> 01:18:00.684]  I want to stay with my wife and children, but you kill me!
[01:18:00.984 --> 01:18:04.487]  You only give this system against you ten times the power!
[01:18:04.707 --> 01:18:07.089]  And that's why they haven't killed me yet, because they know it!
[01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:14.291]  So you have the power.
[01:18:14.631 --> 01:18:16.152]  Humanity has the power.
[01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:17.733]  We have the power.
[01:18:18.054 --> 01:18:24.218]  What would make these criminals put poisons in our food and water to try to blind us and fog our vision?
[01:18:24.618 --> 01:18:26.259]  Because they're scared of you.
[01:18:26.739 --> 01:18:29.001]  The crooks know how humans work.
[01:18:29.321 --> 01:18:32.543]  They know the secret of humanity, but they seek to hide it.
[01:18:32.943 --> 01:18:35.645]  They seek to block you from ever fully developing.
[01:18:35.985 --> 01:18:40.348]  They seek to block you from ever becoming who you really are because they're scared of you.
[01:18:40.689 --> 01:18:41.829]  And always remember that.
[01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:42.610]  That's the secret.
[01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:45.572]  Got another line here, point number 3 of about 40.
[01:18:46.572 --> 01:18:53.356]  Technotronic and technocratic power is built on illusion.
[01:18:54.237 --> 01:18:55.598]  It's built on fraud.
[01:18:56.358 --> 01:18:57.819]  It's built on lies.
[01:18:58.179 --> 01:19:01.441]  And you don't have to listen to what I say or believe what I say.
[01:19:01.781 --> 01:19:03.883]  All you gotta do is start looking around.
[01:19:04.243 --> 01:19:05.744]  Start thinking for yourself.
[01:19:06.104 --> 01:19:07.525]  Start investigating things.
[01:19:08.105 --> 01:19:10.547]  And you will see it all right there.
[01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:15.471]  You do that, you get past your fear, you start reaching out to others.
[01:19:15.772 --> 01:19:21.523]  So many people reach out to people and they're like, I know this sounds kooky, I know it's bad and crazy, but I think we shouldn't trust the government.
[01:19:22.766 --> 01:19:23.547]  I mean, what?
[01:19:24.477 --> 01:19:38.691]  A government with over 10,000 plus admitted programs, some programs, tens of thousands apiece, killing foster children, radiating people, shooting people up with syphilis, nerve gassing troops.
[01:19:39.071 --> 01:19:40.172]  I mean, it just goes on.
[01:19:40.813 --> 01:19:41.934]  Oh my God, I'm sorry.
[01:19:41.954 --> 01:19:44.096]  I think we might not trust these people.
[01:19:44.456 --> 01:19:45.457]  They only killed a whole bunch.
[01:19:46.218 --> 01:19:50.886]  They only had troops over and over again march into radiation after they dropped A-bombs and hydrogen bombs.
[01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:55.394]  They had the troops use depleted uranium, which their own handbooks say is going to kill them down the road.
[01:19:55.434 --> 01:19:57.798]  I'm sorry I'm talking bad about these people.
[01:19:57.819 --> 01:19:58.880]  I apologize.
[01:20:00.936 --> 01:20:03.099]  I mean, think of how crazy that is.
[01:20:03.579 --> 01:20:05.522]  They just convinced us because it's the system.
[01:20:05.802 --> 01:20:06.824]  It's the establishment.
[01:20:07.084 --> 01:20:07.925]  And all of us do it.
[01:20:07.945 --> 01:20:09.667]  We're all part of the system one way or another.
[01:20:09.928 --> 01:20:12.972]  So, you know, well, you've done well now in the system.
[01:20:13.292 --> 01:20:17.317]  Now time to go to the next level and join the team and be pragmatic.
[01:20:17.698 --> 01:20:18.979]  That's the speech you'll get.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:25.943]  And it's a load of bull, because the people above you that are inviting you into their New World Order, they're slaves.
[01:20:26.283 --> 01:20:27.343]  They've sold out to it.
[01:20:27.964 --> 01:20:29.564]  They're blind or they're cowards.
[01:20:29.844 --> 01:20:30.865]  You don't want to be part of them.
[01:20:31.065 --> 01:20:34.967]  Like Patrick Henry said, hey, forget you are our brethren, our brothers.
[01:20:35.567 --> 01:20:36.727]  Go from us in peace.
[01:20:37.047 --> 01:20:39.609]  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[01:20:39.849 --> 01:20:42.570]  Let your chains sit lightly upon you.
[01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:47.472]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:20:55.117 --> 01:21:06.602]  You don't think the central bankers, through fraud and just fiat garbage they made up and paid politicians to save us the money, took over, and went, I can't believe we took over with this con game.
[01:21:06.982 --> 01:21:07.522]  What are we going to do?
[01:21:07.842 --> 01:21:10.343]  We've got some scientists that say if you start poisoning the water, it'll dumb them down.
[01:21:10.804 --> 01:21:12.944]  We can get rid of a bunch of them and they won't wake up to this.
[01:21:13.245 --> 01:21:14.045]  This is really a good deal.
[01:21:14.205 --> 01:21:16.446]  We've got some scientists that say they can make you live forever, too.
[01:21:18.097 --> 01:21:19.258]  Well, hell, let's kill all these people!
[01:21:19.278 --> 01:21:20.018]  I mean, you know.
[01:21:20.478 --> 01:21:21.599]  I mean, listen.
[01:21:21.859 --> 01:21:22.719]  The Romans did it.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.321]  Every culture went in and wiped out everybody they conquered.
[01:21:25.841 --> 01:21:27.902]  I mean, this is just being done high-tech to everybody.
[01:21:28.142 --> 01:21:29.543]  And they just zombify you.
[01:21:29.583 --> 01:21:30.744]  They wipe out your mind.
[01:21:31.004 --> 01:21:32.064]  They wipe out your soul.
[01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:39.248]  But humanity is so strong, despite this fog we're walking through, despite everything they've done to us, we're still here.
[01:21:39.568 --> 01:21:40.068]  And you know what?
[01:21:40.108 --> 01:21:41.189]  It's going to boomerang on them.
[01:21:41.469 --> 01:21:46.612]  Because once humanity knows it's under attack, and once humanity knows what's going on,
[01:21:47.092 --> 01:21:48.935]  Nothing on earth is going to stop us.
[01:21:49.776 --> 01:21:50.176]  Nothing!
[01:21:55.424 --> 01:22:02.914]  And I'll issue another message to the global controllers and their camp followers and all their servants and all their slaves.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.121]  We're not just trying to save humanity here.
[01:22:06.461 --> 01:22:08.862]  You people are clearly going to destroy yourselves.
[01:22:09.183 --> 01:22:10.023]  I covered that earlier.
[01:22:10.523 --> 01:22:13.845]  I mean, the genetic engineering, the weapons, the antimatter weapons, all of it.
[01:22:14.105 --> 01:22:16.927]  All the crazy stuff you guys are doing, trying to one-up each other.
[01:22:16.947 --> 01:22:17.927]  Oh, really?
[01:22:17.967 --> 01:22:18.448]  You did that?
[01:22:18.468 --> 01:22:21.329]  We just produced something that'll kill 99% of people when we release it.
[01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:22.590]  Oh, that's really great!
[01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:25.151]  Oh, you've got underground bunkers to protect you from that.
[01:22:25.371 --> 01:22:28.173]  You're going to be down in the bunkers with a bunch of people like you?
[01:22:28.853 --> 01:22:29.954]  You vampires!
[01:22:30.454 --> 01:22:33.256]  You vampires only exist off of us!
[01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:42.862]  Can you imagine some crypt a mile under the ground or under some mountain with all these vampires who've killed us if they succeed living with each other?
[01:22:43.682 --> 01:22:45.223]  I don't think they've thought this out.
[01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:53.269]  Now we've gotten to point number four now.
[01:22:59.033 --> 01:23:01.775]  And I already pretty much covered this three times, so I'll just make it brief.
[01:23:02.075 --> 01:23:03.656]  What does waking up mean?
[01:23:04.841 --> 01:23:05.641]  What does waking up mean?
[01:23:05.661 --> 01:23:07.222]  It means you're no longer in a dream.
[01:23:07.502 --> 01:23:12.744]  Like George Carlin, he said, yeah, it's the American dream, because you've got to be asleep to believe it.
[01:23:21.028 --> 01:23:22.809]  And if you expand on that,
[01:23:24.813 --> 01:23:25.934]  What does it mean to be a white?
[01:23:26.614 --> 01:23:28.515]  It just means you look into things.
[01:23:28.655 --> 01:23:31.776]  It means you don't just automatically buy what you're being told.
[01:23:31.836 --> 01:23:35.338]  It means, again, people say, oh Alex Jones wants people to believe the way he wants.
[01:23:35.598 --> 01:23:36.519]  Believe the way I want.
[01:23:38.177 --> 01:23:42.318]  I mean, I'm so tuned into what's going on in the world, I can't even handle the stream of information.
[01:23:42.378 --> 01:23:45.259]  I'm more like an egg frying on a pan or something.
[01:23:45.699 --> 01:23:48.679]  Talk about brain on drugs, talk about brain on reality.
[01:23:49.159 --> 01:23:53.300]  Look, I know why people tune out of reality, because it's hardcore.
[01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:57.741]  I don't need any drug to take a ride on this machine.
[01:23:59.282 --> 01:24:01.802]  And I'm not just talking about the ugly things in the world.
[01:24:02.502 --> 01:24:04.863]  Let me tell you something, I watch my young daughters running around,
[01:24:05.834 --> 01:24:08.456]  Playing games, or drawing, or fighting with each other.
[01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:09.937]  I mean, that's entertainment.
[01:24:10.297 --> 01:24:12.499]  These are happy, energetic creatures.
[01:24:12.559 --> 01:24:14.580]  My son, these are beautiful creatures.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.061]  Just like every other child I see.
[01:24:16.462 --> 01:24:17.682]  That's the spirit of humanity.
[01:24:17.923 --> 01:24:20.765]  That's what humans are before the world corrupts them.
[01:24:21.245 --> 01:24:22.686]  And that's the thing that makes me the sickest.
[01:24:23.046 --> 01:24:27.369]  The way this global system seeks to corrupt our youth and turn them against their parents.
[01:24:27.690 --> 01:24:30.091]  And the way Madison Avenue... You know, we're winning.
[01:24:30.411 --> 01:24:33.414]  But when we really win is when we realize status means nothing.
[01:24:33.654 --> 01:24:35.355]  How much money you make means nothing.
[01:24:36.368 --> 01:24:37.128]  It means nothing.
[01:24:37.528 --> 01:24:38.589]  It means nothing.
[01:24:39.549 --> 01:24:43.171]  What matters is your heart and your soul and what you stand for.
[01:24:43.471 --> 01:24:44.491]  That's the value.
[01:24:45.131 --> 01:24:45.972]  That's eternal.
[01:24:47.252 --> 01:24:47.993]  That's what's good.
[01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:56.216]  And that brings us now to the subject of trendies.
[01:24:58.663 --> 01:25:00.784]  Now, when I say trendies, what am I talking about?
[01:25:01.265 --> 01:25:06.268]  Well, that gets into Edward Bernays and psychological warfare and Madison Avenue and advertisement.
[01:25:07.309 --> 01:25:11.412]  But it goes back thousands of years, really to China, but other cultures did it as well.
[01:25:12.792 --> 01:25:19.057]  They would get the Chinese royalty to bound their women's feet where they couldn't even walk.
[01:25:19.963 --> 01:25:22.144]  And the priest class would tell them, because it was stylish.
[01:25:22.644 --> 01:25:23.605]  And you've got to be stylish.
[01:25:23.645 --> 01:25:24.305]  You're royalty.
[01:25:24.405 --> 01:25:25.146]  You don't walk.
[01:25:25.666 --> 01:25:26.507]  We feed you.
[01:25:27.127 --> 01:25:28.548]  And they said, well, God, if it's trendy.
[01:25:30.129 --> 01:25:39.314]  That was the governmental class, the national security class, taking control of the great grandkids of some Chinese warlord that had taken over the area.
[01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:44.336]  But they explained, first you wear big fancy outfits and crowns, so you impress everybody.
[01:25:44.596 --> 01:25:47.158]  But next, you're so royal, you don't
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:57.479]  And to make sure you don't walk, we're going to bind your feet where you can't walk so that now the bureaucratic security class we see now taking over TSA
[01:25:58.254 --> 01:25:59.055]  is in control.
[01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:02.316]  And you can look at it in Babylon, you can look at it in ancient Egypt.
[01:26:02.757 --> 01:26:04.217]  Every culture did this.
[01:26:04.237 --> 01:26:10.501]  And you go back 500 years ago, it was illegal all over Europe to wear certain colors or wear certain outfits.
[01:26:10.621 --> 01:26:12.082]  Only the gentry could wear that.
[01:26:12.142 --> 01:26:13.482]  Only the royalty could wear that.
[01:26:13.843 --> 01:26:15.303]  Only the elite could wear that.
[01:26:15.724 --> 01:26:19.326]  And so people would kill steel to wear a certain color cloak.
[01:26:20.106 --> 01:26:23.812]  They would kill for that pair of Air Jordans like you've seen in the news.
[01:26:24.353 --> 01:26:25.675]  It's the same thing.
[01:26:26.036 --> 01:26:32.426]  And that way the system doesn't just make money every year, gotta throw out that wardrobe, it's not cool anymore.
[01:26:33.348 --> 01:26:34.389]  Now you've got to
[01:26:36.721 --> 01:26:39.143]  Get into the mindset and the idea.
[01:26:39.263 --> 01:26:47.031]  And so what they took with fashion, which, bowing people's feet, or in some cultures, putting big boards on people's heads, so like cone heads.
[01:26:47.431 --> 01:26:49.032]  I mean, this is what priest class did.
[01:26:49.453 --> 01:26:50.934]  And the priest class would always sit back and laugh.
[01:26:51.335 --> 01:26:56.439]  Oh, we got the royals, who used to run us a hundred years ago, wearing big boards on their heads.
[01:26:56.479 --> 01:26:57.380]  They can't even walk.
[01:26:58.681 --> 01:27:00.023]  Because it's stylish!
[01:27:01.348 --> 01:27:06.810]  And of course, the average tribespeople, oh my God, you've got a bunch of rings around your neck and a big cone head!
[01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:08.170]  Let me bow down to you!
[01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:13.692]  Or you can't even walk, or you're wearing some big giant Queenie outfit in England, or whatever.
[01:27:14.632 --> 01:27:18.894]  This is the type of stuff that they would do over and over again.
[01:27:19.958 --> 01:27:24.060]  So, so many people, they get off on New World Order, global government.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.261]  I heard the TV laugh at that.
[01:27:26.781 --> 01:27:27.622]  I'm trendy!
[01:27:29.883 --> 01:27:33.384]  I mean, this is a pathetic victim of style.
[01:27:34.165 --> 01:27:36.206]  This is a pathetic victim of trendiness.
[01:27:36.646 --> 01:27:42.409]  And again, if you want to have purple hair, if you want to have 18 million tattoos, or none, or a big cowboy hat,
[01:27:43.209 --> 01:27:48.111]  I don't care what you're doing as long as that's what you like, because I don't see what you look like or what you're wearing.
[01:27:48.151 --> 01:27:49.812]  I see the content of your deeds.
[01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:55.574]  The point is, the globalists know how to sell you through trendiness.
[01:27:56.114 --> 01:27:58.535]  That is one of their main systems of control.
[01:27:58.936 --> 01:28:09.100]  I mean, I still have reporters call me up, or Nightline show up, or MSNBC, or Rolling Stone, or you name it, and they go, so you're imagining a world government.
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:14.145]  And I go, well, let me take you to a computer and show you, I don't know, a couple thousand mainstream articles saying world government is being established.
[01:28:14.785 --> 01:28:17.027]  And they go, oh no, we don't want to look at those.
[01:28:17.928 --> 01:28:23.634]  Literally, literally, Nightline, like ABC Nightly News host, looked at me.
[01:28:24.294 --> 01:28:25.956]  He said, no, we don't want to look at those.
[01:28:25.996 --> 01:28:27.798]  We just want to ask you about why you think it's real.
[01:28:29.966 --> 01:28:35.108]  And I said, it was like a year ago, and I said, I'm not going to do this interview unless you come and watch this.
[01:28:36.108 --> 01:28:43.010]  So I showed him Al Gore, the head of the EU, Herman Van Rompuy, British Prime Minister at the time, Gordon Brown, George Bush, world government.
[01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:45.031]  I showed him what the world government means, corporate fascist state.
[01:28:45.051 --> 01:28:48.392]  And he looked at me, he said, this happened in my office.
[01:28:48.412 --> 01:28:50.993]  He goes, they don't mean the same world government as you.
[01:28:54.214 --> 01:28:54.394]  Yeah.
[01:28:56.146 --> 01:28:58.428]  And then I'll have Media Matters call me up.
[01:28:59.289 --> 01:29:00.590]  Ring, ring, Media Matters.
[01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:02.492]  It's the editor of Media Matters.
[01:29:02.532 --> 01:29:04.313]  I go, oh, you're funded by George Soros.
[01:29:04.653 --> 01:29:05.694]  No, we're not, Alex.
[01:29:06.115 --> 01:29:11.960]  I pull up the Federal Elections Commission stuff where they're funding it and the different filings for non-profits.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.042]  I go, well, it says a million here, a million there.
[01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:15.303]  I mean, it shows he's the head guy.
[01:29:15.323 --> 01:29:17.085]  And they go, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:29:19.252 --> 01:29:21.934]  I mean, here's my biggest frustration.
[01:29:22.234 --> 01:29:29.459]  These people operate in a world where they're just used to everyone not knowing the three branches of government, not knowing anything.
[01:29:29.979 --> 01:29:31.941]  And then they just say, there's no world government.
[01:29:31.961 --> 01:29:33.061]  They go, there's no world government.
[01:29:33.381 --> 01:29:35.103]  I read these police training manuals.
[01:29:35.143 --> 01:29:36.243]  They come in daily now.
[01:29:37.344 --> 01:29:40.606]  And it's like, if they talk about a world government run by banks,
[01:29:42.045 --> 01:29:44.507]  I'd actually see one that says, go ahead and bring them in.
[01:29:45.007 --> 01:29:49.311]  And chiefs, don't get mad if your guys bring them in, because they're probably a terrorist.
[01:29:50.411 --> 01:29:56.156]  I mean, you can watch European C-SPAN, those different feeds.
[01:29:56.216 --> 01:29:59.799]  It's all world government, mega banks taking over, but they're telling the cops.
[01:30:00.839 --> 01:30:03.841]  If somebody talks about this, go ahead and arrest them.
[01:30:04.162 --> 01:30:05.803]  They're probably a terrorist and they want to kill you.
[01:30:06.323 --> 01:30:08.205]  But see, it's having an opposite effect.
[01:30:08.745 --> 01:30:18.753]  As people wake up to the hoax, as the world wakes up to this fraud, it has the opposite effect because they're like, well, everybody's saying world government, but you say it doesn't exist.
[01:30:19.253 --> 01:30:22.596]  The minute the public loses their trust in this system, it's over.
[01:30:23.096 --> 01:30:28.741]  The system has gone so over the top that that's their weakness.
[01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:32.595]  And so the question is, is humanity scum?
[01:30:33.898 --> 01:30:34.820]  Is humanity weak?
[01:30:35.919 --> 01:30:40.181]  Will we give in to this technological tyranny?
[01:30:40.682 --> 01:30:42.923]  Will we be conned by it?
[01:30:43.363 --> 01:30:47.085]  Or can we see through this elaborate giant hoax?
[01:30:47.465 --> 01:30:52.688]  Because it was Hitler that said, the bigger the lie the better, the more they'll believe it.
[01:30:53.108 --> 01:31:03.074]  And so when something is so giant, so huge, and everyone around you, who's a bunch of trendies, who goes along with whatever's said, because they're in the in-group, they're yes-men,
[01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:06.432]  They make being followers and yes-men cool.
[01:31:06.632 --> 01:31:07.592]  That's what trendiness is.
[01:31:08.052 --> 01:31:12.973]  When all the trendies are saying it must be that way, you've got to be the person that says no.
[01:31:13.653 --> 01:31:15.434]  But you can't do it in a timid way.
[01:31:16.154 --> 01:31:22.815]  You are literally fighting for free humanity and talking to someone who's in a zombie-like state.
[01:31:23.256 --> 01:31:24.796]  And so how you deal with them is your
[01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:27.348]  You're prerogative.
[01:31:28.248 --> 01:31:34.033]  I agree with Jim Mars that sometimes it's good not to preach, but just ask questions.
[01:31:34.553 --> 01:31:41.758]  But in my humble view, on average, it's best to hit somebody in the head with a 2x4, politically.
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:43.480]  It is!
[01:31:45.953 --> 01:31:53.396]  No, I mean, it is, because here, I'm spending my time trying to warn somebody about something.
[01:31:53.676 --> 01:31:57.058]  I mean, I'm talking to some yuppie or trendy who's saying something to me.
[01:31:57.418 --> 01:32:05.942]  They come up and make a joke when I'm in the grocery store, and I turn around and look at them, and they think their disdain has any effect on me, except for me having pity on them.
[01:32:06.882 --> 01:32:11.404]  So I guess it does have an effect, and they're laughing at me, and I just tell them,
[01:32:12.895 --> 01:32:13.596]  Well, okay.
[01:32:13.636 --> 01:32:20.723]  I mean, if you really think things are going good, and you really think the government doesn't lie to you, and you really think everything's wonderful, I guess you're right.
[01:32:21.403 --> 01:32:22.845]  I guess everything is okay.
[01:32:22.905 --> 01:32:27.229]  And you've got a lot of power groveling to the system.
[01:32:27.409 --> 01:32:29.231]  And I've turned away from them on my shopping cart.
[01:32:29.251 --> 01:32:30.172]  It's happened like 20 times.
[01:32:30.725 --> 01:32:32.867]  And they start going, no, no, I agree with you, it's a problem.
[01:32:33.287 --> 01:32:41.634]  Oh, oh wait, you just wanted to feel powerful and make me feel like I was shunned for some little petty, petty power trip you're on.
[01:32:41.875 --> 01:32:43.456]  I'm way beyond that.
[01:32:43.776 --> 01:32:47.399]  I've done this with police many times when they're threatening to arrest me protesting or whatever.
[01:32:47.419 --> 01:32:50.602]  And I just go, oh, you really like your kids growing up in this tyranny?
[01:32:51.003 --> 01:32:52.404]  You really like playing these games with me?
[01:32:52.564 --> 01:32:53.505]  Just go ahead and arrest me.
[01:32:53.665 --> 01:32:54.766]  Go ahead and beat my head in.
[01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:58.067]  Go ahead and shoot me in the back of your patrol car, because you've got all the power.
[01:32:58.287 --> 01:33:02.748]  But know this, I'm not shelling out like you are, so go ahead and do it!
[01:33:09.711 --> 01:33:18.553]  And at that point, those groveling to the system lose all their power, because I don't care anymore, and I'm beyond all your games!
[01:33:18.873 --> 01:33:22.615]  I'm beyond your whole matrix, your whole system of bullshit!
[01:33:22.875 --> 01:33:23.395]  It's over!
[01:33:27.162 --> 01:33:33.485]  When I talk to you, when I meet you in person, I'm just like, my God, why am I the person even up here doing this?
[01:33:34.346 --> 01:33:37.087]  I mean, humanity has got so much strength.
[01:33:37.907 --> 01:33:40.729]  We've got all the cards in our hand if we just play them.
[01:33:41.389 --> 01:33:42.250]  That's all we've got to do.
[01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:44.051]  Human destiny.
[01:33:44.391 --> 01:33:45.991]  We control our environment.
[01:33:46.612 --> 01:33:48.553]  Technocrats are engineering us.
[01:33:50.434 --> 01:33:52.475]  There's no other creature
[01:33:53.599 --> 01:33:59.101]  on this planet that can do one one thousandth of what we do.
[01:33:59.761 --> 01:34:04.243]  There are no creatures that can even begin to do anything.
[01:34:04.283 --> 01:34:05.584]  And let me tell you, I love elephants.
[01:34:05.604 --> 01:34:06.404]  I love whales.
[01:34:07.164 --> 01:34:10.926]  I love the raccoons that break into my garage and rob the refrigerator.
[01:34:11.686 --> 01:34:13.147]  I even set a camera up to watch them.
[01:34:14.187 --> 01:34:15.808]  About ten of them invaded my dad's house.
[01:34:15.828 --> 01:34:19.049]  He took photos of them sitting on the counter sitting there eating apples.
[01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:27.234]  But they're not designing rockets, they're not building computers, they're not making beautiful music.
[01:34:27.954 --> 01:34:30.276]  And again, just value who you are.
[01:34:30.756 --> 01:34:38.282]  So much of defeating the globalists, everything they do is about making you think you're crap, making you think you're worthless, making you think you're petty.
[01:34:38.522 --> 01:34:47.288]  So you need to buy into their system when every human being on this world is beautiful and is amazing and is a creature of unlimited potential.
[01:34:54.226 --> 01:34:56.328]  But we are able to control our environment.
[01:34:56.789 --> 01:35:04.577]  So an inbred group of psychopaths that I'll get to in a moment, they are creating a false environment.
[01:35:04.617 --> 01:35:06.058]  Like we're at the zoo or something.
[01:35:06.098 --> 01:35:06.899]  That's how they see us.
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:09.982]  Henry Kissinger writes books calling the military dumb animals.
[01:35:10.643 --> 01:35:14.705]  I mean, they constantly talk about how we're animals, we're scum, we're trash.
[01:35:15.045 --> 01:35:18.847]  That's how they always sell their abuse on different groups of people.
[01:35:19.107 --> 01:35:26.870]  And now across the board, we're dumb animals, we don't have a soul, they have a soul because they're illuminated, and they deserve to go on and we deserve to die.
[01:35:27.230 --> 01:35:35.075]  No, we're just not twisted freaks like you that would figure out elaborate scams to cheat and hammer and screw everybody.
[01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:38.418]  It's you, the cancer, that is the aberrant problem.
[01:35:38.658 --> 01:35:41.140]  It's you that needs to be kicked off this planet!
[01:35:47.524 --> 01:35:55.149]  So, we control our environment, just like this theater, this coliseum, this cathedral we're meeting in, that was built in the 1930s.
[01:35:56.681 --> 01:35:57.682]  80-something years ago.
[01:35:58.122 --> 01:36:00.123]  We control the environment.
[01:36:00.583 --> 01:36:06.126]  You individually, everything you stand for is incredibly powerful.
[01:36:06.406 --> 01:36:09.248]  Don't ever forget how powerful you are.
[01:36:13.283 --> 01:36:17.286]  So, the social engineers have created this artificial system.
[01:36:17.686 --> 01:36:18.687]  It's not complete yet.
[01:36:18.967 --> 01:36:21.249]  People say, well, are they in total control, Alex?
[01:36:21.689 --> 01:36:21.849]  No.
[01:36:22.349 --> 01:36:24.131]  They're trying to get in control.
[01:36:24.931 --> 01:36:32.737]  They've got a lot of power, they're able to steer things, and we're in there trying to steer the ship away from despotism, towards freedom.
[01:36:33.477 --> 01:36:34.418]  And that's the issue.
[01:36:35.438 --> 01:36:37.841]  There's nothing they can do against people power.
[01:36:38.181 --> 01:36:51.635]  There's nothing they can do when the individual is enlightened, when the individual is aware, when the individual is involved, when the individual realizes that every little thing they do adds together and that many hands make light work.
[01:36:52.316 --> 01:36:56.160]  That is what the global system is afraid of.
[01:36:58.086 --> 01:37:01.047]  So they are creating an artificial environment for us all.
[01:37:01.527 --> 01:37:02.948]  We should become aware of it.
[01:37:03.248 --> 01:37:12.532]  We should realize all electronics, all systems we're given on record, I've interviewed Dr. Stallman, all the big engineers, are designed to control us.
[01:37:12.932 --> 01:37:18.254]  We're paying with the iPhones and all the rest of it for the back doors that they built into it.
[01:37:18.594 --> 01:37:23.416]  And I'm not saying, oh my God, don't use an iPhone because they control it, they're tracking us.
[01:37:23.876 --> 01:37:26.397]  Just realize you've got a powerful enemy weapon.
[01:37:26.997 --> 01:37:30.458]  That's meant to be used against you, and you better use it against them.
[01:37:30.698 --> 01:37:36.940]  Because a weapon can be used by whoever's hands it's in.
[01:37:38.761 --> 01:37:41.222]  Realize, this is powerful technology.
[01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:43.363]  This is Star Trek right here.
[01:37:44.383 --> 01:37:49.085]  And this wasn't given to us because they want us to buy their $200 phone made by slaves.
[01:37:50.105 --> 01:37:52.646]  This was given to us because it's meant to track and control us.
[01:37:53.817 --> 01:37:55.979]  But we're going to use this tool against them.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:38:00.804]  And while we use the tool, we're going to talk about the Trojan horse built into it.
[01:38:00.824 --> 01:38:02.766]  You understand that?
[01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:09.752]  We're getting in the ring with the system.
[01:38:10.473 --> 01:38:11.394]  That's what we're doing.
[01:38:12.135 --> 01:38:15.278]  And we're aware of who we're in the ring with.
[01:38:17.321 --> 01:38:18.441]  Now moving quicker here.
[01:38:19.302 --> 01:38:21.143]  Fighting tyranny is not work.
[01:38:21.523 --> 01:38:22.443]  It is destiny.
[01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:23.644]  It is fulfillment.
[01:38:23.984 --> 01:38:25.304]  Survival is winning.
[01:38:25.945 --> 01:38:27.165]  Wonderment is winning.
[01:38:27.585 --> 01:38:34.068]  Realizing how beautiful life is, watching flowers grow outside your house, or ants building a
[01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:38.170]  a ant bed or watching your children play.
[01:38:38.611 --> 01:38:44.434]  This is all incredible and we're not going to get fulfillment from the globalist brainwashing corporate system.
[01:38:44.675 --> 01:38:54.341]  We're going to get fulfillment from what it is to be alive on a planet hurtling through space orbiting the sun in the Milky Way Galaxy!
[01:38:57.315 --> 01:38:59.696]  And with that, I've got to give you a line from a Rush Song.
[01:39:00.136 --> 01:39:03.997]  Put aside the alienation, get on with the fascination.
[01:39:04.457 --> 01:39:07.377]  The real relation, the underlying theme.
[01:39:08.298 --> 01:39:09.758]  Reality is what matters.
[01:39:10.858 --> 01:39:17.580]  Look, I can talk to millions of people, more than 3 million people a day, but there is so much more energy.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:21.661]  It is so much more real to actually be here with you now.
[01:39:22.001 --> 01:39:23.101]  And I want to talk about this.
[01:39:24.687 --> 01:39:29.471]  Here's Wired Magazine, the latest issue that Rob Jacobson bought and brought to me.
[01:39:30.031 --> 01:39:32.293]  Your next car will drive itself.
[01:39:35.495 --> 01:39:36.416]  And they've already said.
[01:39:36.436 --> 01:39:41.059]  And a whole bunch of states already have robot 18 wheelers and robot cars.
[01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:47.664]  And they're already saying, as I said they would do five years ago, the robot cars have less wrecks.
[01:39:48.264 --> 01:39:50.206]  Maybe you shouldn't be allowed to drive.
[01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:54.732]  And the robot cars are watching you.
[01:39:56.053 --> 01:39:58.976]  And the robot cars know when you've been nodding.
[01:40:01.297 --> 01:40:06.201]  And I've got all these articles, how they're going to do it, just like all the drones.
[01:40:06.682 --> 01:40:09.704]  Oh, you think the military loves Ron Paul and is waking up?
[01:40:10.025 --> 01:40:10.265]  Yeah.
[01:40:11.286 --> 01:40:18.852]  We got like 10 years till everything's combat droids on the ground and AI self-aware.
[01:40:20.436 --> 01:40:21.938]  Autonomous kill drones.
[01:40:23.199 --> 01:40:29.826]  The New World Order is taking all your energy, all your work, all the science you develop, all the things you do, and building a Skynet.
[01:40:30.967 --> 01:40:34.331]  You know Skynet predates the Terminator.
[01:40:35.768 --> 01:40:40.449]  The Terminator isn't life imitating art, it's art imitating life.
[01:40:41.050 --> 01:40:48.972]  You can go pull up Pentagon documents about a SkyGrid Skynet from the 70s and all the drones they were going to have.
[01:40:49.052 --> 01:40:51.473]  And then I interviewed the former head of Star Wars program.
[01:40:51.833 --> 01:41:04.315]  He said by the late 70s, you were told it was launched in the 80s, they already had hundreds of drones in orbit with SABO DU rounds that could decapitate every government on earth in one hour.
[01:41:05.015 --> 01:41:06.456]  In the 1970s.
[01:41:07.216 --> 01:41:09.636]  That's where the national security state is.
[01:41:09.956 --> 01:41:11.016]  That's where your money went.
[01:41:11.396 --> 01:41:13.297]  That was almost 40 years ago.
[01:41:13.837 --> 01:41:15.297]  Why do you think they're so arrogant?
[01:41:15.957 --> 01:41:20.338]  But despite the fact that they have all that power, they're still scared of you.
[01:41:20.799 --> 01:41:21.540]  For a good reason.
[01:41:23.383 --> 01:41:29.333]  If we can turn this around before they get their automated robot system in place, we've got a good chance of beating them.
[01:41:30.214 --> 01:41:33.981]  Once that robot system's in place, then it's time for God to step in.
[01:41:42.645 --> 01:41:46.126]  And just like Nineveh was given a hundred year reprieve, we can have that.
[01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:49.767]  But we have to stand up and do what's right, even if you don't believe in God.
[01:41:50.327 --> 01:41:52.707]  The point is, the New World Order believes in evil.
[01:41:54.088 --> 01:41:55.068]  So what do you believe in?
[01:41:55.088 --> 01:41:56.708]  You better ask yourself that question.
[01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:05.570]  The Controllers know that we are not animals.
[01:42:06.031 --> 01:42:09.591]  They know that we are builders and creators, as I said earlier.
[01:42:10.352 --> 01:42:11.672]  And they are attempting
[01:42:12.625 --> 01:42:15.466]  To not just play God, but to become God.
[01:42:15.826 --> 01:42:17.446]  The problem is, they're not God.
[01:42:18.027 --> 01:42:23.508]  And that's why everything they create... It now turns out it was 40 years ago they cloned rabbits and sheep.
[01:42:23.588 --> 01:42:25.609]  Probably earlier with the Nazis, but admitted now.
[01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:28.090]  They were cloning humans 30 years ago.
[01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:29.150]  You can pull this up.
[01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:32.711]  They would, quote, kill them when they were in the embryonic phase.
[01:42:33.171 --> 01:42:34.892]  If you believe that, I've got a bridge I'm going to sell you.
[01:42:36.292 --> 01:42:39.993]  And everything they've done has been a poisonous abomination.
[01:42:40.414 --> 01:42:41.234]  None of it works.
[01:42:42.173 --> 01:42:44.876]  Neutron bombs, hydrogen bombs, everything.
[01:42:45.076 --> 01:42:46.077]  I showed you a video earlier.
[01:42:47.018 --> 01:42:48.259]  This is on the national news.
[01:42:48.779 --> 01:42:54.785]  Oh, we fired several hundred high-powered hydrogen bombs into the atmosphere to see if we could ignite the planet's atmosphere.
[01:42:55.406 --> 01:42:57.367]  And they ask them, so it would burn the Earth up?
[01:42:57.407 --> 01:42:58.328]  Well, that was the test.
[01:42:59.049 --> 01:43:00.150]  You're like, well, why'd you do that?
[01:43:00.170 --> 01:43:00.751]  It could kill us.
[01:43:01.091 --> 01:43:02.532]  Well, because we're scientists.
[01:43:03.793 --> 01:43:06.456]  Again, it's this power trip that they're on.
[01:43:08.407 --> 01:43:10.889]  The controllers know, again, that we're not animals.
[01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:18.574]  They all day try to teach us that we're animals, that we don't have free will, because they want us just to believe that we're these programmable creatures.
[01:43:19.755 --> 01:43:21.436]  They're attacking our free will.
[01:43:21.596 --> 01:43:25.119]  They're buying and selling men's psyches, women's psyches.
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:30.923]  They are counterfeits to everything good and wholesome in life.
[01:43:32.224 --> 01:43:36.367]  They want our free will shut down, just like the John Carpenter film.
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.241]  They live, we sleep.
[01:43:40.401 --> 01:43:43.722]  Well, I'm ready for us to stop sleeping and to wake up.
[01:43:43.982 --> 01:43:44.682]  What about you?
[01:43:49.844 --> 01:43:52.505]  Are you awake or do you sleep?
[01:43:57.267 --> 01:43:59.607]  When you're awake, it doesn't mean you see what I see.
[01:43:59.627 --> 01:44:01.028]  You got your own two eyes.
[01:44:02.068 --> 01:44:02.949]  Are you awake?
[01:44:03.069 --> 01:44:03.889]  What do you see?
[01:44:06.311 --> 01:44:07.051]  Tyranny!
[01:44:07.752 --> 01:44:09.793]  You see a bunch of control freaks.
[01:44:10.313 --> 01:44:15.796]  My God, in my own life, I'm embarrassed of power because power is dangerous.
[01:44:16.156 --> 01:44:20.218]  Like the uncle of Spider-Man tells him, with great power comes great responsibility.
[01:44:20.538 --> 01:44:24.360]  But these wicked people, they're not ashamed of power.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.421]  They're ready to use it!
[01:44:29.522 --> 01:44:30.983]  Now I'm going to get into solutions.
[01:44:32.148 --> 01:44:38.274]  Number one, the state is not God and it cannot deliver you freedom or security.
[01:44:38.774 --> 01:44:49.504]  In every case in history, whether it was Katrina or whether it was what happened in World War II, the state cannot and will not protect you.
[01:44:51.892 --> 01:44:58.634]  The police will tell you they have no liability and no statutory responsibility to protect you.
[01:44:58.914 --> 01:45:06.235]  Does that not mean there aren't great cops everywhere that go out and shoot bad guys, arrest scumbags, stop people that are out of control?
[01:45:06.455 --> 01:45:06.655]  No.
[01:45:06.915 --> 01:45:12.277]  A lot of times there are good police that do a great job, but on average they respond 11 minutes after a 911 call.
[01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:17.898]  The state cannot and will not protect you.
[01:45:18.418 --> 01:45:22.202]  And the people at the top of this pyramid do not want to protect you.
[01:45:22.242 --> 01:45:23.003]  So remember that.
[01:45:23.403 --> 01:45:28.348]  The mommy state, anything it gives you is for a reason.
[01:45:28.848 --> 01:45:34.934]  Anything it does for you, in the final equation, has a larger meaning.
[01:45:35.975 --> 01:45:37.817]  There's a lot of examples I could give to that.
[01:45:39.161 --> 01:45:44.383]  I'll use one right now that's just absolutely disgusting and painful to my soul as I think about all the children.
[01:45:45.103 --> 01:45:46.644]  And I'll just tell the story briefly here.
[01:45:48.845 --> 01:45:50.105]  But I've looked at the statistics.
[01:45:51.385 --> 01:45:54.787]  And it doesn't mean that the system they were getting rid of was good.
[01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:55.927]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:45:56.787 --> 01:46:00.009]  It's like you find somebody with a broken leg on the street and you say, you want me to fix that?
[01:46:00.409 --> 01:46:01.229]  And they say, yeah.
[01:46:01.429 --> 01:46:02.810]  Okay, well, I'm going to shoot you in the head.
[01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:05.991]  Well, how about you just fix my broken leg?
[01:46:07.165 --> 01:46:16.850]  In the 1950s, after World War II, all these black veterans were coming back who'd been in combat, and they said, listen, I'm not going to be bossed around anymore and told I'm your property and I'm a second-class citizen.
[01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:20.792]  And I thought this was the side of the Civil War.
[01:46:20.812 --> 01:46:27.675]  And so the system said, all right, the federal government will get involved and we'll come in and fix everything.
[01:46:29.055 --> 01:46:36.339]  And there's all these TV shows and all these movies and all these stories about how great it's been for black Americans with the system's so-called solution.
[01:46:38.936 --> 01:46:47.542]  But when you look at the numbers, 35-40% illegitimacy, one child families in 1952, 92% today.
[01:46:49.103 --> 01:46:54.687]  More than half of black males are even higher in statistics in prison with HIV or other issues.
[01:46:55.708 --> 01:46:58.270]  The family completely broken down, everything destroyed.
[01:46:58.310 --> 01:47:01.592]  The mothers paid not to have men in the house.
[01:47:01.672 --> 01:47:03.033]  The system totally broke down.
[01:47:04.334 --> 01:47:04.454]  And 50%
[01:47:07.431 --> 01:47:13.414]  1% of all black babies since 1974 were cut up and killed and never born.
[01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:15.555]  That's what this was all about.
[01:47:15.575 --> 01:47:18.977]  And listen, listen, but here's the thing.
[01:47:20.938 --> 01:47:22.839]  That was a beta test for everybody else.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:28.262]  That was a beta test, and I'm sorry to get into subjects like this, but this is what we're talking about.
[01:47:28.663 --> 01:47:33.925]  The system didn't come and try to right some previous wrong to try to empower people.
[01:47:34.786 --> 01:47:37.687]  It did what it did to take control of a population.
[01:47:38.027 --> 01:47:43.349]  As Margaret Sanger said, we're going to pose as liberals so we can kill these black weeds.
[01:47:43.389 --> 01:47:44.510]  You can pull those quotes up.
[01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:46.070]  Universities have her letters.
[01:47:48.091 --> 01:47:49.632]  She's burning in hell now, don't worry.
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:48:01.386]  The point is, as a non-sequitur, MSNBC will call me up and they say, you believe in a new world order, does that mean you're a racist?
[01:48:01.806 --> 01:48:08.393]  I don't know, I'm not like a liberal fake scumbag like you, who's out there promoting the killing of 51% of black people.
[01:48:09.794 --> 01:48:13.337]  I mean listen, 74, 74 is the year I was born.
[01:48:13.357 --> 01:48:13.878]  38 years ago.
[01:48:17.788 --> 01:48:22.835]  Half the black people, and let's say there's some racists here or tribalists or whatever, whatever.
[01:48:23.135 --> 01:48:24.317]  I get everybody's fighting with each other.
[01:48:24.337 --> 01:48:24.977]  I get it.
[01:48:24.997 --> 01:48:25.518]  I understand it.
[01:48:25.798 --> 01:48:27.060]  Everybody's been screwed by everybody.
[01:48:27.521 --> 01:48:28.121]  I understand it.
[01:48:28.422 --> 01:48:28.722]  Okay.
[01:48:29.003 --> 01:48:32.307]  I understand from the black perspective, white perspective, Mexican, everything.
[01:48:32.347 --> 01:48:32.727]  I get it.
[01:48:33.228 --> 01:48:33.588]  I get it.
[01:48:34.028 --> 01:48:36.410]  The point is, I don't agree with it, but I get it.
[01:48:36.730 --> 01:48:37.470]  I know why people do this.
[01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:43.333]  The point is, are you going to sit there with 51% of the black kids and line them up and shoot them in the head yourself?
[01:48:43.693 --> 01:48:50.917]  Because if you're not going to sit there with little black children and shoot them right in the head yourself because, well, they don't deserve to live, boom!
[01:48:51.237 --> 01:48:53.638]  Then don't give me that bull.
[01:48:53.878 --> 01:48:57.820]  If you don't have the nerve to line those kids up and blow their heads off, I don't want to hear it.
[01:49:00.185 --> 01:49:01.546]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:49:01.866 --> 01:49:06.007]  This is an anti-human agenda that's being done against us all.
[01:49:06.267 --> 01:49:07.428]  And it's gotta come down.
[01:49:07.688 --> 01:49:08.648]  It's gotta be defeated.
[01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:09.849]  It's gotta be changed.
[01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:13.190]  Cancer's up by over 2,000% in the last 50 years.
[01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:15.691]  Diabetes by 3,000-plus percent.
[01:49:15.991 --> 01:49:18.372]  Neurological disorders, thousands of percent.
[01:49:18.692 --> 01:49:19.653]  Autism, 10,000%.
[01:49:20.473 --> 01:49:22.134]  The plague is everywhere.
[01:49:22.314 --> 01:49:23.474]  We're all being killed.
[01:49:23.674 --> 01:49:24.775]  We're all being attacked.
[01:49:24.955 --> 01:49:27.096]  We're all being aborted after we're born!
[01:49:27.316 --> 01:49:28.196]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:49:28.376 --> 01:49:29.897]  And it's time for the New World Order!
[01:49:30.178 --> 01:49:31.253]  To back off!
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:47.425]  Because make no mistake, I don't have the words or the will to express to you how real this is.
[01:49:47.885 --> 01:49:49.987]  You're experiencing it, how real it is.
[01:49:50.527 --> 01:49:54.070]  And they start World War III, you're really going to see how real it is.
[01:49:54.290 --> 01:49:59.694]  Because these globalists are so ruthless, 9 out of 10 nuclear reactors are now openly leaking.
[01:49:59.954 --> 01:50:01.175]  And what does the EPA do?
[01:50:01.375 --> 01:50:06.039]  They raise the level of radioactive waste at SAFE 100,000 times!
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:09.181]  Go look at the EPA's own website!
[01:50:09.402 --> 01:50:10.823]  These are crazy people!
[01:50:12.728 --> 01:50:15.412]  My God, I've almost gone crazy just watching them!
[01:50:16.294 --> 01:50:17.335]  God Almighty!
[01:50:17.756 --> 01:50:19.759]  When does this crazy land in?
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:21.542]  When does humanity wake up?
[01:50:21.862 --> 01:50:23.445]  When does humanity say no?
[01:50:23.786 --> 01:50:27.491]  When does humanity start stomping some globalist guts?
[01:50:34.306 --> 01:50:35.547]  Make no mistake.
[01:50:36.288 --> 01:50:37.950]  Make no mistake, humanity.
[01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:40.452]  The globalists are watching right now.
[01:50:40.932 --> 01:50:43.535]  I want to hear Humanity's wardrobe!
[01:50:43.555 --> 01:50:52.283]  I don't care what you do to me!
[01:50:52.643 --> 01:50:55.166]  I'm coming on hard, you son of a bitch!
[01:51:02.438 --> 01:51:12.103]  Do we really want to turn our species over and everything we are and everything we're ever going to be to a bunch of inbred psychopath globalist trash?
[01:51:16.406 --> 01:51:20.328]  I consider it an honor to run up against their barbed wire.
[01:51:20.688 --> 01:51:23.670]  I consider it an honor to crush globalist scum.
[01:51:30.970 --> 01:51:41.660]  This war we face is run by a bunch of chicken-necked, globalist, cowardly nerds who think we're weak, and they've learned how to attack real men through sneaky means.
[01:51:42.181 --> 01:51:50.169]  Real men and women have to wake up to what they've done, get scientific, realize it, spread the word, and we're gonna kick their ass!
[01:51:58.322 --> 01:52:07.148]  You know, George W. Bush, after he staged 9-11 with his daddy, he said, you're either with us, or with those al-Qaeda terrorists they hired on record.
[01:52:08.029 --> 01:52:09.710]  Well, I got news for the New World Order.
[01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:14.073]  You're either with humanity, or you're against us, and we're coming!
[01:52:14.093 --> 01:52:24.120]  I gotta get moving here, there's only three pages left.
[01:52:27.213 --> 01:52:28.994]  I gotta save some voice for the radio tomorrow.
[01:52:31.536 --> 01:52:33.838]  God, I just think about the chips.
[01:52:34.719 --> 01:52:36.120]  I think about the cost.
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.481]  I think about what we're up against.
[01:52:38.062 --> 01:52:39.743]  God Almighty, if people knew what I knew.
[01:52:39.763 --> 01:52:43.546]  If people knew this wasn't a bunch of bull and had actually looked into it.
[01:52:43.586 --> 01:52:47.089]  I know a lot of you looked into it, but if you looked into it, this rabbit hole is so deep.
[01:52:48.510 --> 01:52:53.693]  Things I've seen are so out of control, it's ridiculous that anybody would serve this system.
[01:52:53.873 --> 01:52:57.595]  That anybody could think that you're going to win serving this evil.
[01:52:57.615 --> 01:52:59.696]  The only thing you're going to do is destroy your family.
[01:53:00.136 --> 01:53:02.238]  There's not even a choice here fighting this New World Order.
[01:53:02.878 --> 01:53:03.858]  There's not even a debate.
[01:53:04.179 --> 01:53:07.080]  There's not even a discussion once you've seen what I've seen.
[01:53:07.701 --> 01:53:08.861]  And I know a lot of you have seen it.
[01:53:08.881 --> 01:53:10.482]  A lot of you have seen things I haven't seen.
[01:53:11.142 --> 01:53:13.664]  How the hell could we give ourselves over to this evil?
[01:53:14.044 --> 01:53:15.385]  How could we be part of this?
[01:53:16.656 --> 01:53:23.402]  All I know is it's a choice and I'm saying I'm not part of this and I'm putting all in against this right now.
[01:53:24.543 --> 01:53:25.084]  Right now!
[01:53:25.764 --> 01:53:26.925]  Right now on the table!
[01:53:29.227 --> 01:53:30.829]  And that's what it is to be alive.
[01:53:31.289 --> 01:53:32.771]  You want to be alive?
[01:53:35.813 --> 01:53:38.476]  You're not going to find it in some Armani suit.
[01:53:39.617 --> 01:53:42.840]  You're not going to find it in a mansion or some bling.
[01:53:43.655 --> 01:53:47.858]  You're gonna find truth defending the innocent against evil!
[01:53:48.178 --> 01:53:50.160]  That's the only place you're gonna find it.
[01:53:56.965 --> 01:54:03.150]  I've put my name, my children, my wife, my treasure on the line.
[01:54:03.730 --> 01:54:04.951]  And I am committed.
[01:54:05.591 --> 01:54:10.015]  And when you're committed, there's nothing that can stop you!
[01:54:20.213 --> 01:54:23.594]  Can you imagine the awakening that's going to happen if they release those bioweapons?
[01:54:24.335 --> 01:54:25.655]  After we've warned people so much?
[01:54:25.715 --> 01:54:30.057]  God Almighty, I hope the next phases of what we've broken down don't happen.
[01:54:30.597 --> 01:54:32.338]  God Almighty, I hope they don't.
[01:54:33.399 --> 01:54:34.199]  But I know one thing.
[01:54:34.279 --> 01:54:35.179]  I'm sure selfish.
[01:54:35.259 --> 01:54:36.640]  I've sure gotten my family ready.
[01:54:37.941 --> 01:54:39.001]  What are the solutions?
[01:54:40.422 --> 01:54:41.922]  Well, first off, it's to wake up.
[01:54:42.122 --> 01:54:43.543]  And I've already talked about what that means.
[01:54:44.343 --> 01:54:45.744]  That's different for every person out there.
[01:54:46.957 --> 01:54:49.258]  But to wake up is to tune into something powerful.
[01:54:49.698 --> 01:54:50.138]  Know that.
[01:54:50.478 --> 01:54:54.620]  The reason many people tune into reality and tune right out is because they can't handle it.
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:56.260]  The question is, can you handle it?
[01:54:57.501 --> 01:54:59.441]  Wake others up once you're awake.
[01:54:59.561 --> 01:55:00.402]  That is the key.
[01:55:01.062 --> 01:55:05.103]  Realize that you are the most important of missions.
[01:55:05.263 --> 01:55:12.506]  You are on an incredible mission, alive in an amazing time, in a struggle against death and life.
[01:55:12.986 --> 01:55:14.707]  I had good and evil here, but that's not right.
[01:55:14.747 --> 01:55:15.507]  It's death and life.
[01:55:16.530 --> 01:55:17.230]  The New World Order.
[01:55:17.250 --> 01:55:20.011]  I used to read the Bible as a child and I didn't understand it.
[01:55:20.771 --> 01:55:22.932]  The devil comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:55:22.952 --> 01:55:24.913]  That's all it wants.
[01:55:26.033 --> 01:55:27.994]  That's all it's here to do is destroy this planet.
[01:55:28.834 --> 01:55:30.654]  And it's a great contest that we're involved in.
[01:55:31.835 --> 01:55:35.776]  And the system tells us it doesn't matter what we do, it's all preordained, but that's a lie.
[01:55:36.616 --> 01:55:41.638]  Because if you really know the history and the world, we are deciding what we do.
[01:55:42.018 --> 01:55:45.459]  What we stand for brings in God's providence.
[01:55:50.399 --> 01:55:52.040]  I already talked about this earlier.
[01:55:52.821 --> 01:55:59.026]  The devil's greatest trick is convincing the world he doesn't exist.
[01:55:59.526 --> 01:56:01.148]  Again, I'll say this to you now.
[01:56:01.508 --> 01:56:08.614]  If you're an atheist, if you're whatever you are, the point is the elite, I've studied them, they believe in a devil.
[01:56:09.454 --> 01:56:10.916]  They believe in Lucifer.
[01:56:11.176 --> 01:56:12.737]  They worship a Lucifer.
[01:56:12.957 --> 01:56:19.843]  And whether it's real or not, they're manifesting it at Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove and all the rest of it.
[01:56:21.434 --> 01:56:23.375]  They revel in hurting innocents.
[01:56:23.636 --> 01:56:25.177]  They revel in hurting children.
[01:56:25.597 --> 01:56:29.500]  Everything they stand for is the opposite of what we stand for.
[01:56:30.781 --> 01:56:31.461]  Think about that.
[01:56:31.862 --> 01:56:38.827]  Look at history before you deny or scoff, because those that ignore history are fools and they will repeat it.
[01:56:39.287 --> 01:56:41.429]  I seek to not repeat history.
[01:56:42.490 --> 01:56:44.111]  I seek a reprieve.
[01:56:48.547 --> 01:56:57.771]  Realize that you're on the most important mission of missions and that you represent the survival of humanity and the struggle of good versus evil.
[01:56:59.092 --> 01:57:00.632]  An infinity of activism.
[01:57:00.792 --> 01:57:03.173]  Everything you do, you won't hear it back.
[01:57:04.894 --> 01:57:06.495]  At least the first day of the first year.
[01:57:07.115 --> 01:57:08.916]  But you, it will come back to you.
[01:57:08.956 --> 01:57:11.397]  The question is, do you realize it's like a rock in a pond?
[01:57:12.097 --> 01:57:13.538]  What is that activism doing?
[01:57:13.618 --> 01:57:14.939]  What does that activism say?
[01:57:15.279 --> 01:57:17.900]  What is it going to create in the larger destiny?
[01:57:18.871 --> 01:57:19.671]  That's the question.
[01:57:20.612 --> 01:57:22.433]  And again, it's that right purpose.
[01:57:22.493 --> 01:57:23.353]  It's that commitment.
[01:57:23.393 --> 01:57:26.895]  It's not that you even think you're going to save the world by your actions.
[01:57:27.215 --> 01:57:34.438]  It's that the spirit of liberty and freedom and truth and justice and that you do the right thing because you're compelled to do it.
[01:57:35.099 --> 01:57:37.420]  And that's an unstoppable order in the world.
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:39.221]  That's a transmission.
[01:57:39.281 --> 01:57:40.521]  That's a coded message.
[01:57:40.741 --> 01:57:41.822]  That's a command.
[01:57:42.182 --> 01:57:43.262]  It's a demand.
[01:57:43.723 --> 01:57:44.083]  It is
[01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:48.152]  Calling down the power of the Creator of the Universe.
[01:57:48.472 --> 01:57:49.352]  And nothing can stop that.
[01:57:49.393 --> 01:57:53.355]  You're not going to find it in these 501c3, sold out, New World Order churches.
[01:57:53.655 --> 01:57:56.937]  You're going to find it facing evil.
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:05.342]  Recognize false paradigms and help others recognize them.
[01:58:05.602 --> 01:58:07.483]  And there's just countless false paradigms.
[01:58:08.564 --> 01:58:11.526]  And no one's pure, so everything's false to a certain extent.
[01:58:12.247 --> 01:58:17.529]  There is all these false systems of thought and dichotomies, but they're always about playing ribs off against each other.
[01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:18.990]  They're always about division.
[01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:20.331]  They're always about infighting.
[01:58:20.631 --> 01:58:23.572]  They're always seeking to divide the people.
[01:58:24.372 --> 01:58:26.133]  And you can recognize them once you're awake.
[01:58:26.233 --> 01:58:28.114]  Once you have discernment, you will recognize them.
[01:58:29.715 --> 01:58:32.876]  Map the artificial habitat, proto-matrix grid.
[01:58:33.717 --> 01:58:36.258]  A proto-matrix is a matrix that's not complete yet.
[01:58:37.196 --> 01:58:41.680]  The Matrix movie, as I said with Terminator, was actually written about, again, in the 70s.
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:42.701]  You can pull this up.
[01:58:42.721 --> 01:58:44.383]  It's in my book, Descent into Tyranny, online.
[01:58:44.643 --> 01:58:45.644]  It's free online everywhere.
[01:58:46.565 --> 01:58:54.051]  Where the Pentagon talked about all the things you basically see in the Matrix as their own crazy vision of how we're all plugged into machines.
[01:58:54.632 --> 01:58:56.834]  Incrementally, we're being programmed towards
[01:58:57.293 --> 01:59:22.422]  interfacing with the machines, into buying into the false reality, buying into the robot cars, the robot houses, the robot helicopters, the robot drones, a system where we're displaced from everything, and these big automated systems run everything, so that we don't have a choice, so we don't live on the land, so we're not independent, and all the government documents, and all the government training is attacking those Amish, and those farmers, and those
[01:59:22.942 --> 01:59:26.903]  separatists and those people that want to be left alone and grow their own food.
[01:59:26.943 --> 01:59:27.983]  They've got to be watched.
[01:59:28.023 --> 01:59:33.284]  They're dangerous because it wants to force you into its system where it controls you.
[01:59:33.664 --> 01:59:34.644]  Realize that!
[01:59:35.124 --> 01:59:35.764]  It's happening.
[01:59:35.804 --> 01:59:39.245]  It's part of this dependence control grid that we're facing.
[01:59:46.946 --> 01:59:49.427]  Don't underestimate the enemy's twisted designs.
[01:59:50.578 --> 01:59:52.860]  If you can think of it, they're doing it.
[01:59:54.121 --> 01:59:55.343]  I've played this game at the office.
[01:59:55.363 --> 01:59:57.925]  We can come up with the most wild thing you can imagine, and the government's doing it.
[01:59:58.326 --> 01:59:59.427]  Just type it into a search engine.
[01:59:59.487 --> 02:00:00.107]  Oh, they're doing it.
[02:00:00.648 --> 02:00:02.249]  Oh, they've been doing it 20 years.
[02:00:03.210 --> 02:00:06.353]  It is mind-blowing to see this going on.
[02:00:06.914 --> 02:00:08.876]  It is mind-blowing to see this happening.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:15.303]  But don't underestimate your power and the power of action.
[02:00:16.043 --> 02:00:17.384]  And I'm going to give you some examples of this.
[02:00:18.204 --> 02:00:21.166]  Last night I'm driving up here and we wanted to get some bottled water.
[02:00:22.186 --> 02:00:28.270]  So we we pull in to a CVS pharmacy partway to Dallas.
[02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:37.615]  And I'll walk in and there's like giant take your flu shot signs and there's a fluoride water for babies everywhere.
[02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:47.956]  So I shoot like a two minute video and like a third of the comments were, I can't believe he wasn't thrown out.
[02:00:49.415 --> 02:00:53.077]  I can't believe he got away with this.
[02:00:53.137 --> 02:00:57.159]  And I'm like, I had to wait 10 minutes for one cashier to show up.
[02:00:57.639 --> 02:01:03.982]  These are all corporate robot drone systems shutting down our economy by design to make us dependent.
[02:01:04.262 --> 02:01:05.062]  There was no one there.
[02:01:05.362 --> 02:01:05.963]  So what did they do?
[02:01:06.483 --> 02:01:07.343]  Hey, I'm shopping here.
[02:01:07.383 --> 02:01:12.686]  I want to show you're selling mercury-filled shots to people and fluoride on record that gives kids brain cancer and bone cancer.
[02:01:13.026 --> 02:01:13.706]  I mean, so what?
[02:01:19.946 --> 02:01:27.048]  But what's amazing about this is, is that people didn't believe I did it.
[02:01:27.148 --> 02:01:28.508]  Like, it was so bold.
[02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:31.149]  He walked in for two minutes and showed somebody something.
[02:01:31.429 --> 02:01:35.670]  That's... That guy's... It's gotta be fake.
[02:01:37.851 --> 02:01:42.112]  I mean, who are these people that they think to turn up... I mean, literally.
[02:01:42.552 --> 02:01:46.493]  I'm walking along to get some bottled water, and I'm like, it's all got fluoride in it for babies.
[02:01:47.353 --> 02:01:49.254]  And I'm just going, oh, we got this going on here.
[02:01:49.878 --> 02:01:50.759]  Yeah.
[02:01:50.839 --> 02:01:51.819]  And people think it's fake.
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:58.443]  So, don't underestimate the enemy's twisted designs, but don't underestimate your own power.
[02:01:59.904 --> 02:02:02.685]  I mean, looking at this, I sneak into Bohemian Grove.
[02:02:03.185 --> 02:02:04.706]  People can't believe I actually did it.
[02:02:08.969 --> 02:02:16.833]  No, but... There are hundreds of examples of stuff I've done, and I'm nobody.
[02:02:17.905 --> 02:02:22.531]  Any of you could do similar things, as long as you're mission-oriented.
[02:02:23.031 --> 02:02:26.696]  Hell, my dogs can go out and catch rabbits or squirrels all day and kill them.
[02:02:27.136 --> 02:02:29.238]  Not because they're superheroes, they just go out and do it.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:31.481]  I mean, it's not hard.
[02:02:31.821 --> 02:02:34.164]  But my point is, is that
[02:02:37.466 --> 02:02:41.368]  I just went through, I BS'd the Secret Service, I got the footage, I got out.
[02:02:41.808 --> 02:02:45.249]  People were like, it's impossible, no one can get in there, no one can do that.
[02:02:45.569 --> 02:02:47.070]  Then I stormed the Texas Capitol.
[02:02:47.290 --> 02:02:48.190]  I was ready to be arrested.
[02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:49.191]  I stormed in.
[02:02:49.451 --> 02:02:53.232]  Hey, you're going to let the TSA grope everybody after you unanimously voted to do it?
[02:02:54.093 --> 02:03:00.295]  And people said, people said, they said, it must be fake.
[02:03:00.475 --> 02:03:01.916]  No one can do something like that.
[02:03:02.492 --> 02:03:05.654]  Well, I bet there's people in this audience who stormed the Capitol with me.
[02:03:05.954 --> 02:03:07.015]  Not once, but twice.
[02:03:07.515 --> 02:03:08.195]  Right over here!
[02:03:09.296 --> 02:03:11.697]  What, are you a government agent, part of a Hollywood film?
[02:03:13.138 --> 02:03:14.199]  Yes, he is.
[02:03:14.239 --> 02:03:14.859]  He says he is.
[02:03:15.439 --> 02:03:16.020]  The point is...
[02:03:17.225 --> 02:03:21.868]  Is that hundreds of times, I have done things that were easy to do.
[02:03:22.389 --> 02:03:24.190]  And everybody's like, that couldn't be real.
[02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:24.530]  Why?
[02:03:24.590 --> 02:03:26.471]  He couldn't possibly do that.
[02:03:26.892 --> 02:03:29.053]  And that's this idea that you're little.
[02:03:29.493 --> 02:03:30.454]  You don't have power.
[02:03:30.794 --> 02:03:31.995]  You can't get stuff done.
[02:03:32.375 --> 02:03:33.256]  It's ridiculous.
[02:03:33.856 --> 02:03:37.859]  I never intended 17 years ago getting an access television show in Austin, Texas.
[02:03:38.599 --> 02:03:46.865]  I never intended to now, 17 years later, conservatively be reaching 15 million people every week.
[02:03:47.944 --> 02:04:01.190]  I mean, I never even... But listen, I'm just an average guy from Dallas, Texas, who woke up to the New World Order.
[02:04:03.331 --> 02:04:06.713]  I mean, listen, again, I am nothing special.
[02:04:07.393 --> 02:04:08.534]  I'm just an average person.
[02:04:09.354 --> 02:04:11.835]  You attack me, I'm going to attack right back.
[02:04:13.476 --> 02:04:16.838]  It is such a simple equation.
[02:04:18.004 --> 02:04:24.529]  I've simply stood up 17 years ago, and I've seen devastating effects on the globalists.
[02:04:24.609 --> 02:04:30.633]  I've had victory after victory after victory after victory after victory.
[02:04:36.417 --> 02:04:38.419]  But I will tell you the key ingredients.
[02:04:38.539 --> 02:04:42.742]  Hard work, research, doggedness, and fearlessness.
[02:04:44.043 --> 02:04:45.684]  Because once you commit to something,
[02:04:46.909 --> 02:04:47.870]  That's just the way it is.
[02:04:48.290 --> 02:04:49.490]  And that's nothing special.
[02:04:49.731 --> 02:04:54.533]  That's a human trait that I share with my ancestors and that you share with your ancestors.
[02:04:54.833 --> 02:04:58.155]  And the globalists cannot take that away from you.
[02:04:58.375 --> 02:04:59.056]  Here are some of the points.
[02:04:59.336 --> 02:05:00.156]  Bohemian Grove.
[02:05:00.236 --> 02:05:01.617]  People didn't believe that was real.
[02:05:01.817 --> 02:05:03.258]  Even though they admitted it and were threatening me.
[02:05:05.215 --> 02:05:06.816]  I've called the FBI on air.
[02:05:06.856 --> 02:05:07.996]  I've called the White House.
[02:05:08.056 --> 02:05:09.217]  I've called Homeland Security.
[02:05:09.917 --> 02:05:12.258]  Yeah, I've interviewed witnesses.
[02:05:12.278 --> 02:05:14.039]  The underwear bomber was put on the plane by the U.S.
[02:05:14.059 --> 02:05:15.800]  government months before it came out.
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:18.581]  And they're like, we're not going to take that report.
[02:05:18.721 --> 02:05:19.061]  Click.
[02:05:20.262 --> 02:05:23.743]  And listeners see this on the air and on TV and they go, that couldn't be real.
[02:05:23.983 --> 02:05:25.184]  He wouldn't call the FBI.
[02:05:25.204 --> 02:05:26.064]  That's Jack Bauer.
[02:05:26.084 --> 02:05:28.465]  They'd come cut his body parts off.
[02:05:28.485 --> 02:05:28.886]  That's fake.
[02:05:31.328 --> 02:05:33.169]  Bohemian Grove calling the FBI.
[02:05:33.349 --> 02:05:34.809]  They didn't believe the CVS was real.
[02:05:34.889 --> 02:05:35.849]  That's not like it's courage.
[02:05:35.869 --> 02:05:37.170]  Like, oh, I videotaped something.
[02:05:37.410 --> 02:05:37.950]  My God!
[02:05:38.170 --> 02:05:38.890]  It can't be real!
[02:05:39.250 --> 02:05:43.132]  He actually videotaped it in a store, like I care what some store clerks say.
[02:05:43.532 --> 02:05:47.853]  Like if a store clerk comes around the corner, uh, sir, you're not allowed to videotape it here.
[02:05:48.473 --> 02:05:56.315]  Oh, God, my life's so... I mean, oh, really?
[02:05:56.335 --> 02:05:57.976]  This is really getting to me right now.
[02:06:00.171 --> 02:06:03.814]  Now if somebody calls up and threatens to kill your family, that does have an effect.
[02:06:03.854 --> 02:06:04.675]  You just double down.
[02:06:05.215 --> 02:06:09.598]  The point is, is that the average person is so disempowered and it's sad.
[02:06:10.239 --> 02:06:11.380]  Ken, you got power.
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:12.160]  Use it.
[02:06:12.241 --> 02:06:12.841]  Stand up.
[02:06:13.141 --> 02:06:14.182]  You're only alive once.
[02:06:14.202 --> 02:06:16.003]  You only got red blood pumping through your veins.
[02:06:16.044 --> 02:06:17.044]  We all got red blood.
[02:06:17.365 --> 02:06:18.966]  You only got it one time, folks.
[02:06:19.386 --> 02:06:19.826]  That's it.
[02:06:20.127 --> 02:06:20.987]  It's all a test.
[02:06:24.915 --> 02:06:29.677]  And at the end of my life I can say, I've made a lot of mistakes, I've had a lot of problems, but you know what?
[02:06:30.017 --> 02:06:32.539]  I didn't coward a bunch of scum and I stood up to them.
[02:06:33.059 --> 02:06:33.739]  That's what matters.
[02:06:39.522 --> 02:06:43.083]  We're told these lies that you can't fight City Hall.
[02:06:43.844 --> 02:06:50.347]  Every time I see people actually get together and keep fighting City Hall, if they've got justice on their side, if they're right,
[02:06:51.229 --> 02:07:03.894]  If the system's wrong, they may lose two, three, four times, but everybody I've ever seen who keeps going and going and going and going and saying, I don't care whether I win or lose, I'm going to keep on a coming.
[02:07:04.394 --> 02:07:06.015]  Nobody can stand up against that.
[02:07:06.035 --> 02:07:19.820]  In fact, it was the founder of the Texas Rangers that said, I'm going to probably butcher this from memory, but a man in the wrong can't win against a man in the right who keeps on a coming.
[02:07:22.347 --> 02:07:28.029]  It is that commitment to keep on a coming that is going to defeat the globalists.
[02:07:28.949 --> 02:07:30.310]  Continuing with successes.
[02:07:32.051 --> 02:07:33.271]  We can fight City Hall.
[02:07:33.311 --> 02:07:34.471]  We are fighting City Hall.
[02:07:34.712 --> 02:07:35.652]  Look at We Are Change.
[02:07:37.152 --> 02:07:40.314]  A 19-year-old kid, part of New York 9-11 Truth.
[02:07:41.394 --> 02:07:45.575]  Luke Rudowsky gets kicked out of 9-11 Truth because it's foundation funded in New York.
[02:07:45.956 --> 02:07:47.296]  He's getting into the New World Order.
[02:07:47.556 --> 02:07:49.917]  He's getting into how America's controlled by these banking interests.
[02:07:50.699 --> 02:07:53.661]  He's not just blaming America like the globalists wanted him to.
[02:07:53.921 --> 02:07:57.743]  He's actually realizing there's a group above America using us as their power slave.
[02:07:58.543 --> 02:07:59.724]  And they tell him, you're out of the group.
[02:08:00.424 --> 02:08:01.305]  Then I get calls.
[02:08:01.445 --> 02:08:02.586]  I get invited to join.
[02:08:02.646 --> 02:08:05.187]  Oh, these people want to meet with you and all these fancy rich people.
[02:08:05.247 --> 02:08:06.188]  No, I don't want to meet with you either.
[02:08:06.508 --> 02:08:09.149]  So I call Luke up and I say, well, they don't want me to talk to you.
[02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:10.010]  I better get you on.
[02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:15.253]  And I get this one, one 19 year old kid from New York.
[02:08:15.433 --> 02:08:17.734]  There's now like 400 plus groups all over the world.
[02:08:17.994 --> 02:08:19.455]  We are change, real change.
[02:08:20.469 --> 02:08:21.730]  Not fighting the globalists.
[02:08:23.051 --> 02:08:26.053]  Another example of what action does.
[02:08:26.433 --> 02:08:28.094]  The universe responds to it.
[02:08:28.915 --> 02:08:32.557]  The universe responds to commitment and honor and sacrifice.
[02:08:34.158 --> 02:08:36.620]  That's one of the biggest solutions here and I'm going to get to it right now.
[02:08:38.441 --> 02:08:39.482]  Look at Ron Paul.
[02:08:47.988 --> 02:08:48.829]  In the space
[02:08:50.126 --> 02:08:54.988]  Of four years, he's more than doubled, in all these states, the amount of votes he's getting.
[02:08:55.269 --> 02:09:06.134]  He's winning almost all the stroll polls, the debates, being short-shift on the time on the debates, being attacked, everything, and now it's all over the news, Washington Post, you name it.
[02:09:06.414 --> 02:09:07.734]  Oh, he really did win Maine.
[02:09:08.095 --> 02:09:11.616]  Oh, there was, they are throwing the election out in Iowa, but we're not going to say why.
[02:09:12.677 --> 02:09:13.717]  The same thing in Nevada.
[02:09:14.198 --> 02:09:17.959]  Look, Ron Paul, look, you see a hundred Ron Paul stickers.
[02:09:17.979 --> 02:09:19.260]  Well, I've never seen a Mitt Romney sticker.
[02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:21.049]  Have you?
[02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.390]  Have you?
[02:09:22.410 --> 02:09:23.351]  I've been all over the country.
[02:09:23.711 --> 02:09:26.593]  Have you ever seen a Newt Gingrich sticker?
[02:09:28.154 --> 02:09:28.334]  No.
[02:09:29.475 --> 02:09:29.635]  No.
[02:09:30.055 --> 02:09:31.696]  You've not seen a Santorum sticker?
[02:09:33.938 --> 02:09:41.283]  And they can steal these elections, but they cannot steal the fact that it changes month to month.
[02:09:41.323 --> 02:09:43.604]  He gets between 71% and 75% of all military donations.
[02:09:52.841 --> 02:09:53.781]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:09:54.542 --> 02:09:55.382]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:09:55.783 --> 02:09:59.484]  Do you think that scares the hell out of the New World Order?
[02:09:59.504 --> 02:10:07.189]  I mean, they're like, get the drones in the air and the robots on the ground as fast as possible.
[02:10:08.089 --> 02:10:11.111]  And I get all the DHS memos, the police, the military send them to me.
[02:10:11.411 --> 02:10:13.372]  It's all, the veterans are terrorists, get ready to kill them.
[02:10:13.512 --> 02:10:17.714]  I mean, it's just like, remember four years ago when I got those documents and nobody believed them?
[02:10:18.034 --> 02:10:20.616]  Where it's like, the returning veterans are the number one threat.
[02:10:21.776 --> 02:10:27.637]  Ron Paul supporters are number two, and there's an anti-tax movie by Aaron Russo that's number three.
[02:10:28.518 --> 02:10:32.418]  These people don't like the Federal Reserve, which we all know is government.
[02:10:32.678 --> 02:10:33.839]  They actually told the cops that.
[02:10:34.419 --> 02:10:36.219]  And then the cops go look it up and find out it's private.
[02:10:37.579 --> 02:10:40.780]  See, the lying runs out at a certain point.
[02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:48.282]  And I can't tell you how many military people, brass, you name it, talk to me on and off air, and they tell me,
[02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:54.573]  About 80% of my commands awake, 70% rarely it's below 50.
[02:10:55.674 --> 02:10:57.456]  And I mean, they're waking up fast.
[02:10:57.496 --> 02:10:58.777]  They're waking up fast.
[02:10:58.817 --> 02:10:59.998]  They're waking up fast.
[02:11:00.858 --> 02:11:08.204]  And the globalists, the globalists, they want to get us into a new war because they know Americans once we're in a war will kind of, well, I don't trust the government, but we're in a war.
[02:11:08.284 --> 02:11:09.946]  You know, I better do what I'm told.
[02:11:10.446 --> 02:11:12.568]  The point is that trick only works so far.
[02:11:13.208 --> 02:11:18.973]  The fact that we've gone from Ron Paul 15 years ago, 16 years ago, when I was first interviewing him, getting
[02:11:19.816 --> 02:11:27.113]  No co-sponsors to audit the private Federal Reserve, to passing it in the House, and the Senate had to kill it procedurally.
[02:11:27.133 --> 02:11:28.436]  You're like, well, they still killed it.
[02:11:28.826 --> 02:11:30.467]  Oh yeah, he's about to get the votes again.
[02:11:30.747 --> 02:11:33.148]  The point is we've gone from nothing to passing it.
[02:11:33.728 --> 02:11:36.209]  The point is, okay, they're cheating Ron Paul.
[02:11:36.510 --> 02:11:38.190]  We show everybody how they cheat him.
[02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:40.791]  And he goes around and educates people.
[02:11:41.092 --> 02:11:42.492]  Resistance is victory.
[02:11:42.892 --> 02:11:49.295]  Every time we decide to stand up to these bullies, we get stronger each and every time!
[02:11:49.315 --> 02:11:50.536]  Don't you see it?
[02:11:58.649 --> 02:11:59.471]  More solutions.
[02:12:00.653 --> 02:12:05.202]  15 years ago, 13 years ago, you couldn't find organic food on a store shelf.
[02:12:06.311 --> 02:12:09.895]  Now, even at mainline grocery stores, half of it's organic, or at least they say it is.
[02:12:10.215 --> 02:12:12.457]  The point is, we're winning, voting with our dollars.
[02:12:12.838 --> 02:12:15.280]  That's a blueprint to defeat the New World Order.
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:29.455]  Did I mention all of this is the fact that we have the power, we've got the energy, we're the people, we're the mass, we're humanity, and these globalists that think they're God are a bunch of malfunctioning, aberrant psychopaths!
[02:12:35.083 --> 02:12:36.664]  The in the Fed movement's exploding.
[02:12:36.684 --> 02:12:38.064]  The organic movement's exploding.
[02:12:38.845 --> 02:12:43.127]  Suddenly, every grocery store I go to, two years ago it was like the trendy places.
[02:12:43.607 --> 02:12:45.448]  Now it's regular grocery stores.
[02:12:45.748 --> 02:12:50.290]  Oh, we don't have BPA in our plastic baggies that sterilize you, give you cancer.
[02:12:50.630 --> 02:12:51.490]  Women, breast cancer.
[02:12:51.610 --> 02:12:52.951]  Men, prostate cancer.
[02:12:53.431 --> 02:12:54.271]  We don't have BPA.
[02:12:54.311 --> 02:12:55.072]  We don't have fluoride.
[02:12:55.092 --> 02:12:56.773]  We don't have, oh God, we're not any part of that.
[02:12:56.813 --> 02:12:57.313]  No, no, no.
[02:12:57.333 --> 02:12:57.913]  Buy our stuff.
[02:12:58.833 --> 02:12:59.054]  See?
[02:12:59.434 --> 02:13:02.055]  You take action, nothing can... That's why
[02:13:02.844 --> 02:13:07.385]  If you look at three years ago, when it came out, the swine flu doubled your chances, the vaccine.
[02:13:07.765 --> 02:13:10.466]  Doubled your chances if you took the vaccine to get the flu the next year.
[02:13:11.026 --> 02:13:12.046]  Had all these health problems.
[02:13:12.066 --> 02:13:14.687]  Didn't protect you from swine flu, which was non-existent.
[02:13:16.747 --> 02:13:18.888]  You know, the H1N1, all this garbage.
[02:13:20.548 --> 02:13:25.269]  As soon as all that happened, suddenly everywhere you go it's flyers.
[02:13:25.309 --> 02:13:28.990]  People come into your office, we'll bring a chocolate cake and shots.
[02:13:29.150 --> 02:13:29.710]  They're free.
[02:13:33.070 --> 02:13:46.716]  Oh, a big mega-corporation like Bayer Pharmaceutical that worked with the Nazis, caught for 10 years shipping out tainted blood to hemophiliacs a few years ago, and Merck and all you, you got a free cake?
[02:13:46.956 --> 02:13:52.379]  And then they call them, look this up, I'm not lying, a vaccine party.
[02:13:55.782 --> 02:14:03.948]  And we knew right then, it turns out, that stuff was a simulant virus they released that's some type of trigger and is carrying a whole other virus.
[02:14:03.989 --> 02:14:04.729]  You can look this up.
[02:14:04.769 --> 02:14:06.150]  I mean, they'd sue me if it wasn't true.
[02:14:06.170 --> 02:14:06.931]  You can look it up right now.
[02:14:07.271 --> 02:14:09.032]  There's a whole carrier virus.
[02:14:09.053 --> 02:14:10.494]  They said, oh, it's contaminated.
[02:14:10.514 --> 02:14:11.554]  It just came out a few months ago.
[02:14:11.755 --> 02:14:12.976]  There is an extra virus in there.
[02:14:12.996 --> 02:14:13.936]  Don't look at it.
[02:14:14.016 --> 02:14:15.878]  Don't look at it under an electron microscope.
[02:14:16.759 --> 02:14:18.960]  Just enjoy what's about to happen to you.
[02:14:20.504 --> 02:14:23.889]  I mean, I mean, this is beyond wild.
[02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:27.533]  It's just like they're already killing all these people around us.
[02:14:27.974 --> 02:14:28.455]  They're dying.
[02:14:28.475 --> 02:14:29.937]  They're dropping dead left and right.
[02:14:30.397 --> 02:14:30.778]  Okay.
[02:14:30.798 --> 02:14:33.241]  I mean, again, I'm not scared of you.
[02:14:34.002 --> 02:14:34.563]  I'm free.
[02:14:34.983 --> 02:14:35.524]  I'm free now.
[02:14:36.485 --> 02:14:37.265]  And I'm free.
[02:14:37.705 --> 02:14:38.185]  I'm free.
[02:14:38.205 --> 02:14:38.746]  You got that?
[02:14:38.766 --> 02:14:39.206]  I'm free.
[02:14:39.566 --> 02:14:40.306]  I'm free of you.
[02:14:40.586 --> 02:14:41.406]  I'm free of fear.
[02:14:41.666 --> 02:14:42.407]  I'm free of it all.
[02:14:42.707 --> 02:14:45.807]  I'm not going to watch you sit there and kill people all day any longer.
[02:14:46.188 --> 02:14:46.888]  You want to kill me?
[02:14:46.968 --> 02:14:47.468]  Go ahead.
[02:14:48.028 --> 02:14:50.169]  All I know is, at the end of the day, you're going down.
[02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:58.631]  Continuing here, states' rights is exploding.
[02:14:59.991 --> 02:15:03.192]  Nullification of out-of-control globalist edicts through our federal government.
[02:15:03.871 --> 02:15:04.431]  are exploding.
[02:15:04.792 --> 02:15:11.777]  Cities, from the one in Tampa with a million people, to Calgary up in Canada, to all over, are removing fluoride.
[02:15:13.037 --> 02:15:13.298]  Oh yeah.
[02:15:14.358 --> 02:15:14.578]  Oh yeah.
[02:15:14.879 --> 02:15:19.862]  They have the scientists come in and go, seven-fold increase in bone cancer, brain damage, here's all the documents.
[02:15:20.162 --> 02:15:22.284]  And they go, okay, you're right, we're going to take it out.
[02:15:23.084 --> 02:15:32.531]  And people are like, well Alex, even though you're having some successes, the states of New Jersey and Arkansas are just passing laws to forcibly fluoridate the water.
[02:15:33.626 --> 02:15:34.946]  They're like, see, you failed.
[02:15:34.986 --> 02:15:36.127]  The feds came in and got that.
[02:15:36.147 --> 02:15:37.307]  I'm like, I failed?
[02:15:37.947 --> 02:15:42.469]  We pointed out it's not the law and made them respond counterattacking.
[02:15:42.789 --> 02:15:43.589]  I'm in the fight.
[02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:44.830]  I'm not failing.
[02:15:47.271 --> 02:15:52.112]  I'm not just laying here and taking somebody attacking me.
[02:15:52.573 --> 02:15:55.193]  And you think I've just begun to fight?
[02:15:55.293 --> 02:15:56.554]  I haven't even gotten started.
[02:15:59.554 --> 02:16:01.375]  Look, they can't kill this message.
[02:16:01.836 --> 02:16:02.636]  They've learned that.
[02:16:03.217 --> 02:16:04.077]  You're there.
[02:16:04.257 --> 02:16:05.518]  You are the future.
[02:16:05.598 --> 02:16:06.539]  You are the leaders.
[02:16:06.599 --> 02:16:07.580]  You are the resistance.
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:10.922]  That's not just something here for a crowd to make you feel good.
[02:16:11.223 --> 02:16:13.224]  I mean it right here in my heart!
[02:16:15.105 --> 02:16:17.107]  You are the resistance!
[02:16:17.487 --> 02:16:19.048]  You are the future!
[02:16:19.349 --> 02:16:21.370]  Your children are the future!
[02:16:22.031 --> 02:16:27.655]  You are what's standing between us and the eugenicist death cult of the New World Order!
[02:16:29.451 --> 02:16:30.512]  You understand that?
[02:16:31.393 --> 02:16:33.194]  You realize that responsibility?
[02:16:34.835 --> 02:16:35.836]  What are you going to do?
[02:16:36.076 --> 02:16:37.497]  Let me hear your war grill!
[02:16:37.818 --> 02:16:46.505]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:16:47.185 --> 02:16:48.346]  This is the hiatus.
[02:16:48.386 --> 02:16:49.347]  This is the honeymoon.
[02:16:49.607 --> 02:16:51.108]  This is the calm before the storm.
[02:16:51.449 --> 02:16:57.894]  All this tyranny you've seen, all this craziness getting out in the open, that's the enemy uncloaking to line up their forces.
[02:16:58.933 --> 02:17:02.396]  The only reason you can see them now is because they're massing, they're lining up.
[02:17:03.177 --> 02:17:08.962]  Let me tell you, but the good thing is, once they fully attack, the gloves are off, it's all out in the open.
[02:17:09.203 --> 02:17:10.944]  You think we've seen an awakening right now?
[02:17:12.165 --> 02:17:15.889]  It doesn't matter whether I make it through this or not, or whether you do individually.
[02:17:16.209 --> 02:17:22.055]  The message has been sent, the horn has been blown, the warning has been issued!
[02:17:27.054 --> 02:17:39.604]  I will tell you again, you are the Paul Reveres of the 21st century, and on your decision to take action rests the future of this species!
[02:17:39.624 --> 02:17:52.615]  Alright, in conclusion, they've got some microphones over here and I'll take some questions.
[02:17:54.909 --> 02:17:56.811]  There's a lot of other solutions I didn't get to.
[02:17:56.831 --> 02:17:58.793]  You know, homeschooling's exploding everywhere.
[02:17:58.833 --> 02:18:00.975]  It's not just for the Amish anymore.
[02:18:02.356 --> 02:18:03.117]  State's rights.
[02:18:04.699 --> 02:18:11.445]  Police and military are waking up everywhere, as I said, and refusing to do gun confiscation drills in places like Arcadia, Iowa.
[02:18:13.147 --> 02:18:14.248]  All of this is going on.
[02:18:15.580 --> 02:18:16.680]  I want to give you a quote.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:18.781]  George Washington gave one like it.
[02:18:18.821 --> 02:18:19.861]  Thomas Jefferson gave one.
[02:18:19.881 --> 02:18:20.661]  They're all similar.
[02:18:21.261 --> 02:18:27.623]  But all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish, grow like big trees, flourish.
[02:18:29.163 --> 02:18:35.805]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[02:18:36.785 --> 02:18:37.325]  Nothing.
[02:18:37.966 --> 02:18:40.366]  You could just do something and stop these people.
[02:18:40.746 --> 02:18:41.607]  They're scared of you.
[02:18:41.927 --> 02:18:43.307]  I cannot express that hard enough.
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:56.285]  And finally, for solutions, constructive criticism is given in a friendly way, in a loving way.
[02:18:56.965 --> 02:18:59.647]  And constructive criticism is good, and I take it from everyone.
[02:19:01.147 --> 02:19:06.611]  But it's generally done privately, or it's done with, we're doing great work, but I think this is a better idea, or what do you think of this?
[02:19:07.151 --> 02:19:12.234]  When you see people operating as patriots, and you see them
[02:19:13.596 --> 02:19:28.667]  operate and then start attacking others savagely, while not attacking the greater evil, you can be assured that by contract or by spirit, unconsciously, they are serving the globalists.
[02:19:29.048 --> 02:19:30.208]  I already knew this years ago.
[02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:31.449]  COINTELPRO, you name it.
[02:19:31.850 --> 02:19:34.912]  But Cass Sunstein, three years ago, the White House regulations are set.
[02:19:35.352 --> 02:19:39.135]  We will pose as conspiracy theorists, those that question known liars.
[02:19:39.155 --> 02:19:40.156]  That's the definition of that.
[02:19:40.456 --> 02:19:42.918]  You question known, confirmed liars, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:19:43.427 --> 02:19:45.489]  Think for yourself, read government documents, your conspiracy theories.
[02:19:46.169 --> 02:19:49.452]  We will infiltrate their ranks and we will attack them.
[02:19:49.853 --> 02:19:54.136]  We will cause infighting, we will put out fake theories, we will do all of this.
[02:19:57.479 --> 02:20:01.603]  And you need to understand that infighting is the globalist tool.
[02:20:02.697 --> 02:20:06.319]  They intend, and let's say you totally disagree with somebody about something.
[02:20:06.699 --> 02:20:09.540]  The point is, do they have the power to tax, the power to destroy?
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:11.461]  Are they pushing vaccines on you?
[02:20:11.721 --> 02:20:12.802]  Are they the system?
[02:20:13.122 --> 02:20:14.482]  Are they the man?
[02:20:15.643 --> 02:20:26.228]  Because let me tell you something, we can all kill each other later if we want, after we've dealt with David Rockefeller and Bill Gates and all these... Listen, listen, listen.
[02:20:27.188 --> 02:20:29.929]  I could call them Nazis, but everybody uses that term.
[02:20:30.209 --> 02:20:31.210]  These are not Nazis.
[02:20:32.352 --> 02:20:37.799]  This is the creature that gave birth to the Nazis.
[02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:40.483]  This is the creature that gave birth to the Communists.
[02:20:40.923 --> 02:20:48.514]  When you study the New World Order, the mega-banks out of England, they are the ones on record who funded all the authoritarian movements.
[02:20:50.127 --> 02:20:56.251]  And Carol Quigley at Georgetown, Bill Clinton's mentor, wrote a 900-page book admitting this.
[02:20:57.031 --> 02:20:58.833]  And what's crazy is I don't just believe his book.
[02:20:59.153 --> 02:21:00.734]  I've separately looked at all the documents.
[02:21:01.054 --> 02:21:08.700]  He's writing a book, only 1,000 copies, for the State Department so that their own CIA section chiefs and others could understand this.
[02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:11.622]  They've got to write a book like, here's how the evil works.
[02:21:12.322 --> 02:21:14.764]  We fund the fascists, the communists, we fund it all.
[02:21:15.084 --> 02:21:15.865]  Here it is.
[02:21:16.225 --> 02:21:17.326]  And of course, one leaked out.
[02:21:17.606 --> 02:21:18.627]  Quigley admitted it was his.
[02:21:20.506 --> 02:21:21.507]  They fund it all.
[02:21:21.807 --> 02:21:23.808]  They're just, they're hyper-dominant.
[02:21:24.008 --> 02:21:26.089]  You ever run into somebody who's really dominant?
[02:21:26.490 --> 02:21:28.371]  Just absolutely has to be in control of everything?
[02:21:28.851 --> 02:21:30.872]  Well, imagine these people like ten times that.
[02:21:31.433 --> 02:21:33.514]  And if they can get the power, they're going to do it.
[02:21:33.854 --> 02:21:35.755]  If they can dominate you, they're going to do it.
[02:21:36.115 --> 02:21:39.778]  And listen, they're like any other bully or some guy that thinks he's the king of the hill.
[02:21:40.198 --> 02:21:41.899]  He's just gonna have to get his butt stomped.
[02:21:42.559 --> 02:21:42.879]  Okay?
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:44.841]  And I mean, that's what it comes down to.
[02:21:45.941 --> 02:21:46.942]  Alright, continuing here.
[02:21:49.929 --> 02:21:52.251]  We are at the crossroads of human destiny.
[02:21:52.291 --> 02:21:54.013]  The universe lays before us.
[02:21:54.593 --> 02:21:57.335]  The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard what God's got in store for us.
[02:21:57.876 --> 02:22:12.068]  The Psychopath Guild known and knows that humanity is awakening and has used our energy, our skills, to construct a global chemical, biological, electronic, spiritual concentration camp.
[02:22:12.947 --> 02:22:17.948]  But our spiritual discernment and our ancestral genetics have sensed the threat.
[02:22:18.468 --> 02:22:22.189]  And for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:22:22.569 --> 02:22:25.529]  And you are that shield of humanity.
[02:22:30.470 --> 02:22:34.691]  In closing, they are coming for us.
[02:22:36.231 --> 02:22:40.112]  And we are facing them down and coming for them.
[02:22:47.315 --> 02:22:50.957]  The globalists are girded for war against us, as I mentioned earlier.
[02:22:51.617 --> 02:22:53.698]  Spy satellites are now watching farmers.
[02:22:54.639 --> 02:22:57.880]  Artificial, intelligent, weaponized, autonomous drones are in our skies.
[02:22:58.460 --> 02:23:00.761]  Biometric cameras scan our faces, our cars.
[02:23:00.861 --> 02:23:03.243]  Soon to buy and sell, they admit, will have to scan.
[02:23:04.303 --> 02:23:12.667]  They can add fines and fees and taxes to that, and Homeland Security has said, as I told you TSA would come to Dallas, they're now on the streets, you will face scan to buy and sell.
[02:23:12.887 --> 02:23:14.348]  Whether you're a Christian or not, it's here.
[02:23:16.255 --> 02:23:19.356]  Ambient, soft-kill, full-spectrum weapons are already being used.
[02:23:19.377 --> 02:23:22.178]  The chemicals, the biologicals, the radiologicals, the GMO.
[02:23:23.638 --> 02:23:28.801]  Anti-family dependency is they destroy our families and turn us against each other and wreck our society.
[02:23:30.121 --> 02:23:37.245]  And all the pollution and curses that come from it, the crime, everything, then they pose as the saviors after they've wrecked our society.
[02:23:38.306 --> 02:23:39.947]  Agenda 21, siege.
[02:23:40.247 --> 02:23:43.429]  The oldest form of war is siege.
[02:23:43.870 --> 02:23:46.491]  And that's what Agenda 21 was set up for.
[02:23:46.552 --> 02:23:54.437]  It's what it was designed for, was to shut down our society, shut down our infrastructure, shut down our systems through taxes and regulations, so we're dependent on them.
[02:23:55.177 --> 02:23:56.818]  Realize they are against us.
[02:23:58.319 --> 02:24:00.941]  They are engaged in slave disarmament, as they call it.
[02:24:01.243 --> 02:24:01.743]  We're good to go.
[02:24:21.058 --> 02:24:23.460]  Classic police state checkpoints on the highways.
[02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:26.702]  A national security state operating in secret.
[02:24:26.922 --> 02:24:30.965]  And even when it gets caught shipping in drugs or guns to Mexico, they don't get in trouble.
[02:24:32.786 --> 02:24:37.189]  I close with Ron Paul and a quote from his book, In the Fed.
[02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:46.015]  It is no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking.
[02:24:46.815 --> 02:24:48.096]  Ron Paul, In the Fed.
[02:24:48.116 --> 02:24:49.257]  Let me say that again.
[02:24:50.982 --> 02:24:58.965]  It is no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking.
[02:24:59.026 --> 02:24:59.526]  Ron Paul.
[02:25:07.569 --> 02:25:12.591]  Americans come from diverse backgrounds, but everyone came here through adversity.
[02:25:12.611 --> 02:25:16.473]  We're a strong, vibrant, but also warlike country.
[02:25:17.133 --> 02:25:20.994]  And it's easy for us to have an enemy dangled in front of us and we charge off to destroy them.
[02:25:21.594 --> 02:25:26.996]  Let's not be mindless beasts of war for the globalists to destroy countries they want to take over.
[02:25:27.036 --> 02:25:38.099]  Let's become conscious of this and realize the real enemy has taken over our nation, as Cicero said, not with a banner openly against our walls, but from within as the traitor, as the plague.
[02:25:39.779 --> 02:25:42.180]  We must cut off the enemy's blood supply.
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:45.721]  We must outlaw fractional reserve banking.
[02:25:46.877 --> 02:25:49.109]  The true power of the money changer.
[02:25:54.682 --> 02:26:04.648]  It is only by ending derivatives, fractional reserve banking, the Federal Reserve, where these rich families issue zeros and ones, we go into debt to them out of nothing.
[02:26:05.308 --> 02:26:08.310]  That is the root, the heart of the New World Order.
[02:26:08.891 --> 02:26:17.596]  The love of money, I wouldn't say is the root of all evil, it is to a certain extent, but it's the creation of money that is the root of evil's control.
[02:26:20.338 --> 02:26:21.378]  And that's what we face.
[02:26:22.419 --> 02:26:24.160]  So I have given you here
[02:26:26.172 --> 02:26:34.896]  What I believe, and from my research what I have seen, is the clearest path towards resisting the globalists.
[02:26:35.936 --> 02:26:52.663]  And certainly you can add upon this, it doesn't mean I have all the answers, I know the best ways to deal with all of this, but I have fought hard against these people and I've studied them deeply and committed my entire intellect and being and psyche and will and spirit to this fight.
[02:26:53.543 --> 02:26:55.284]  And I know that they can be defeated.
[02:26:56.317 --> 02:27:01.361]  I know that they will be defeated if you, humanity, makes the decision to stand against them.
[02:27:01.761 --> 02:27:03.483]  But I've done what I can do.
[02:27:04.363 --> 02:27:06.565]  The ball is in your court.
[02:27:07.286 --> 02:27:09.487]  You will decide the destiny.
[02:27:09.527 --> 02:27:12.470]  When we act, God will provide the providence.
[02:27:12.870 --> 02:27:20.196]  But it's up to you to decide whether or not you want to resist these guys or play along with it for a while and hope that you're not affected.
[02:27:21.345 --> 02:27:22.926]  The choice is up to you.
[02:27:22.946 --> 02:27:26.930]  I want to thank everybody here in Dallas for coming out and people driving.
[02:27:31.874 --> 02:27:37.038]  People driving from Arkansas and Louisiana and New Mexico.
[02:27:37.058 --> 02:27:38.579]  I salute you!
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:39.880]  God bless you!
[02:27:39.900 --> 02:27:44.984]  You're awesome!
[02:27:45.044 --> 02:27:47.767]  Ask yourselves, what are you doing in this time of great challenge?
[02:27:48.667 --> 02:27:50.249]  What are you doing to unlock minds?
