[00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:05.385]  Hi and welcome.
[00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:07.866]  I'm Christy Hightower here from Planet InfoWars.
[00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:15.228]  I'm here with our guest, Alex Jones, who's actually answering your questions from the Ask Alex group on PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:19.969]  This is a special edition marathon version.
[00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.610]  So we're doing 50 questions.
[00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.771]  We'll probably cut it up into little parts so that you can stay tuned.
[00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:27.632]  So let's get started, Alex.
[00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:28.772]  Now, keep that in mind.
[00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:29.332]  Keep them short.
[00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:30.813]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:31.273]  All right.
[00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:40.964]  This first one comes to you from Chuck and he says, you recently had Webster Tarpley on your radio show and asked some great questions such as, are you a communist?
[00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:47.693]  To which Webster replied and elaborated on what he believes and explained as a true American political economic system.
[00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:58.621]  Um, and a lot has been going on and I know that you have numerous issues to cover and very little time, but I'd be interested in hearing what you think of Tarpley's comments about this political system.
[00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:03.064]  He speaks of and he takes, he takes a part on libertarians.
[00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:06.067]  He had a wealth of information to support his ideas.
[00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:08.008]  So, no, that's enough.
[00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:12.991]  Yeah, no, I mean, I, cause I, I did the interview, so I hadn't read the question, but I, I remember it.
[00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:20.917]  Look, it's a difference of views, and he claims the American system is this state-directed system, and it really isn't.
[00:01:21.877 --> 00:01:36.247]  Some of what he said is true, and it's all a philosophy, but if you don't have an engaged, informed population that demands liberty and freedom, you're going to have corruption take over, whether it's a libertarian, laissez-faire system, whether it's a state-directed system.
[00:01:36.747 --> 00:01:41.310]  When the public becomes a bunch of TV head jellyfish, everything is going to go to hell in a handbasket.
[00:01:41.946 --> 00:01:49.710]  And so I, you know, have open debates about a fiat currency run by government or a gold or silver backed or Ron Paul, Von Mies view.
[00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:58.996]  But overall, government centralized systems get taken over by special interest and become extremely corrupt and generally are the worst system.
[00:01:59.356 --> 00:02:01.677]  So, I mean, I've thought long and hard about this.
[00:02:01.877 --> 00:02:09.542]  I've read the literature and history across the spectrum and Tarpley's great on history and great on power structures and the eugenicist.
[00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:10.943]  God love him.
[00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:14.065]  I saw one commenter one time when somebody called in and asked about him.
[00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:17.127]  He said, don't be two-faced behind his back telling this to his face.
[00:02:17.147 --> 00:02:19.268]  This is on the radio and TV.
[00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:20.629]  This is not behind Tarpley's back.
[00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.052]  But I promise, next time he's on, I'm going to say, Tarpley, you've got some blind spots.
[00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:29.375]  You think we should all take all the vaccines because it's some weird communal proletariat thing.
[00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:30.636]  You like McDonald's.
[00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:32.397]  You like aspartame, Diet Coke.
[00:02:33.037 --> 00:02:34.078]  I mean, he's very proud of this.
[00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:36.240]  He goes, what are you going to do, Robinson Crusoe?
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.660]  And I go, no.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.245]  Robinson Caruso isn't not taking shots and drinking aspartame and eating Chicken McNuggets with silicone in them.
[00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:50.049]  So Tarpley's a really smart guy, almost savantish in many ways, because I've been around him personally.
[00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.510]  He speaks like five languages fluently.
[00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.512]  But look, I'm savantish in a way.
[00:02:54.532 --> 00:02:55.392]  I'm sure everybody is.
[00:02:55.972 --> 00:02:58.694]  I've got some spots that are lacking.
[00:02:58.754 --> 00:02:59.415]  I like Tarpley.
[00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:03.295]  He's kind of like a, you know, entertaining mascot around here.
[00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.518]  I mean, we all like Tarpley as a person.
[00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:14.249]  It's just his belief in the state and that the state is the arbiter and is the birth from which all goodness flows.
[00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.352]  I think he's assed backwards in history.
[00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:21.414]  Uh, so I disagree with him and that's what I have to say about Mr. Tarpley.
[00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:22.135]  Good question.
[00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:23.436]  Had to have a longer answer.
[00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:27.859]  We've got one, we're one question down here at PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:31.141]  Folks, this is where you meet, this is where you get involved, this is where you take action.
[00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:33.003]  We're going to have a letter to the editor's section.
[00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:34.124]  I want to get that set up at the time.
[00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:42.512]  So folks can send, not things that I'm going to comment on, but we're going to have Christy sit here and read.
[00:03:42.552 --> 00:03:44.554]  And then if you have a comment, that's great.
[00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:47.076]  I think once a week you should read maybe 20 letters.
[00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:48.818]  That'd be awesome.
[00:03:48.898 --> 00:03:50.159]  Or four paragraphs or less.
[00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.900]  Could I have a rule on that?
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.841]  And then just read them.
[00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:54.484]  That way your view unfettered goes out.
[00:03:55.405 --> 00:03:56.045]  Or I could read them.
[00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:56.666]  I mean, whatever.
[00:03:56.686 --> 00:03:57.587]  That would be interesting.
[00:03:57.607 --> 00:03:58.528]  Erin could read them.
[00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:02.704]  Aaron over there running the camera right now, because he does such a darn good job.
[00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.745]  He has a Facebook following, actually, Aaron.
[00:04:05.085 --> 00:04:05.586]  Oh, Aaron.
[00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:07.387]  Aaron's a rock star over there of Liberty.
[00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:08.327]  All right, go ahead.
[00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:13.491]  All right, well, this next one comes to you from Keisha, and she says, Alex, if you could go back in time, it's kind of a fun question, actually.
[00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:20.356]  If you could go back in time, and when you were younger, but still keep all of the knowledge that you have right now, what would that look like?
[00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:23.118]  Imagine coming home to the first day of kindergarten being a genius.
[00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:24.359]  Oh, yeah.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.360]  Don't we all wish for that?
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.981]  I don't want to say I'm a genius now.
[00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:35.963]  I've often thought, I think everybody's thought of, I think all the mistakes I made, what if I knew all that, you know, back then.
[00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:38.104]  And I think that's where listening to your parents comes from.
[00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:46.751]  But we almost genetically are designed to want to get out of the nest, start our own hut, get out of the system, and our parents are telling us things and we're like not listening to them.
[00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.812]  So there's three ways to learn, I guess.
[00:04:48.832 --> 00:04:50.933]  There's by revelation, we're just beaming to your head.
[00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.996]  There's by experience and there's by being taught.
[00:04:54.936 --> 00:05:06.265]  And experience is a great teacher because you really remember it, but it would be better for young folks out there, even if your old man or mom aren't perfect, they're gonna, they care about you, they're gonna give you some overall advice that's good.
[00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:12.810]  So it's best to not, you know, detest them, because in a way you're detesting yourself.
[00:05:13.551 --> 00:05:17.074]  And so boy, I wish I knew back then what I know now.
[00:05:17.114 --> 00:05:17.294]  What?
[00:05:17.314 --> 00:05:19.456]  Is there a particular day you would want to go back to?
[00:05:19.476 --> 00:05:21.157]  Like, that you think about?
[00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:29.886]  I wish that when some bully started a fight with me that I just learned to back down when I could because it was just pointless.
[00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:35.610]  I don't like all those brain cells I'm missing from my head slamming the concrete and going to jail and stuff like that.
[00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.572]  I mean, I would have been less confrontational.
[00:05:38.522 --> 00:05:44.968]  But in a way, again, that's Catch-22, because I wouldn't be who I am today if I hadn't grown up where I did in Dallas and seen the things I saw.
[00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:46.250]  So, whatever.
[00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.251]  I mean, there's no going back.
[00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.133]  Unless you try to teach your children what you've gone through.
[00:05:50.454 --> 00:05:52.896]  But they haven't experienced it yet, so they're not going to listen.
[00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:55.919]  You know, later you're like, oh, Dad, Mom, you were sure right about that.
[00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.561]  Man, I wish I'd listened to you.
[00:05:57.821 --> 00:05:59.583]  Older you get, the more right your parents get.
[00:05:59.643 --> 00:06:01.464]  It's kind of scary, actually.
[00:06:01.484 --> 00:06:01.845]  Yeah.
[00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:05.689]  Alright, well this next one comes to you from Chris and he says, Alex, a question.
[00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.532]  Are things so different here in the UK?
[00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:14.298]  One thing I've noticed from campaigning in the UK is that the US campaigning is so much more vitriolic.
[00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:20.404]  Do you feel you need a louder voice in the US to get noticed or is it just plain wrong?
[00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:31.414]  Well, I mean, you can do stunts in the media to get noticed, but I've noticed we've inadvertently done stunts before, where it's the right thing the media picks up, but then they still control the message.
[00:06:31.854 --> 00:06:36.976]  It's like you put out something that they're ready to pick up and make big, it's because they can spin it to their advantage.
[00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:37.516]  Right.
[00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:39.877]  So I've never really been calculating about what I do.
[00:06:39.897 --> 00:06:45.199]  You know, it's more of, I think this is important, this is what I'm thinking, feeling, I'd like to impart this.
[00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.120]  And some of it resonates with people, some of it doesn't.
[00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.310]  So it is what it is.
[00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:56.453]  That's why it's important with things like PlanetInfoWars.com that people get together there, start their own campaigns, get involved, meet others.
[00:06:56.853 --> 00:07:06.676]  Because there are people watching out there right now who are smarter than I am, more eloquent than I am, more informed, who've had life experiences that are going to be, you know, bring pieces of the puzzle that I can't cover.
[00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:14.278]  That's why I'm trying to hire all these great reporters and bring in other graphics people and expend the capital I've accrued to try to really go to the next level.
[00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.932]  Because I realize this is a very important position we're in.
[00:07:18.653 --> 00:07:21.417]  And that's why a lot of times it'll be midnight and I shoot a video and upload it.
[00:07:21.897 --> 00:07:25.962]  It's because I realize, man, we've got this limited window to actually effect change for the good.
[00:07:25.982 --> 00:07:27.204]  It's a key time in history right now.
[00:07:27.224 --> 00:07:28.085]  What question are we up to now?
[00:07:28.546 --> 00:07:29.567]  We're up to number four.
[00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:30.588]  Am I moving fast?
[00:07:30.608 --> 00:07:31.830]  You are moving fast.
[00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.272]  Continue the interrogation.
[00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:34.252]  Here it goes.
[00:07:34.632 --> 00:07:36.493]  This is actually from user Tofu.
[00:07:36.573 --> 00:07:37.533]  Clever username.
[00:07:38.234 --> 00:07:40.274]  I'm a former active duty Marine.
[00:07:40.654 --> 00:07:44.896]  I live in Okinawa, Japan, and I listen to your show every day over and over.
[00:07:45.076 --> 00:07:46.836]  The rebroadcast and all of that.
[00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.417]  I believe in you, Alex.
[00:07:48.477 --> 00:07:52.258]  So, I've woken up a few friends and they listen to me like you do.
[00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:59.364]  When I go on Airbase, they scan our civilian ID cards and I'm a prepper.
[00:07:59.724 --> 00:08:02.427]  But my friends think I'm a kook, which I thought was kind of cute language.
[00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:06.572]  Do you think things would become bad for American citizens living abroad like me?
[00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:19.824]  Statistically, in a world financial collapse that's designed to bring in world government, it will be worse to be in areas where you're not indigenous because you don't fit in, you don't blend in with the culture.
[00:08:20.424 --> 00:08:22.966]  When things get rough, you'll be the first person gets turned on.
[00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:30.831]  I don't want to geographically say something about, you know, an island off Japan because you know more about that area than I do because you live there.
[00:08:31.332 --> 00:08:36.636]  So, I think your question states the concern and the knowledge you already have.
[00:08:37.696 --> 00:08:37.896]  But,
[00:08:38.817 --> 00:08:43.620]  You know, cultural bounds mean nothing because we're all human in the final equation.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.124]  If you've got really good friends you've known for years, you know, the cultural differences can be bridged there.
[00:08:49.384 --> 00:08:54.807]  It's just that, I don't know, the Japanese are known for being the opposite of lawless.
[00:08:56.067 --> 00:08:57.868]  Japan's a pretty good place to be during a crisis.
[00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:02.570]  You think Americans would act that polite and nice during a nuclear meltdown?
[00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:09.534]  It'd be looting, mass murder, and death, and burning cities if we had something like you had.
[00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.654]  I mean, instead, like, crime went down when they got hit by tidal waves and had reactors blow up.
[00:09:14.814 --> 00:09:15.074]  Crazy.
[00:09:15.315 --> 00:09:17.176]  Instead, here, it'd be like... Oh, yeah.
[00:09:17.196 --> 00:09:18.237]  So, I mean, I don't know.
[00:09:18.277 --> 00:09:24.943]  Now, if you're thinking about your geographic and cultural locale, even though it's an island, things are more expensive.
[00:09:25.384 --> 00:09:27.145]  You're an island off an island in Okinawa, right?
[00:09:27.165 --> 00:09:27.286]  Mm-hmm.
[00:09:27.326 --> 00:09:31.449]  You know, that's a problem for cost during a collapse, but I don't know.
[00:09:31.469 --> 00:09:32.370]  I mean, there couldn't be a more...
[00:09:34.693 --> 00:09:35.694]  Kind, forgiving people?
[00:09:36.014 --> 00:09:42.039]  Yeah, I mean, just orderly, focused, people too prideful to be crooks, on average, in the Japanese.
[00:09:42.079 --> 00:09:45.222]  So I'm not going to judge it, but it's a mixed bag.
[00:09:46.463 --> 00:09:56.231]  Alright, this next one comes to you from Noah, and he says, is there any proof that British Labour Party politicians John Smith and Robin Cook were assassinated by associates of Tony Blair?
[00:09:56.988 --> 00:09:58.068]  I think that kind of alludes to it.
[00:09:58.088 --> 00:09:59.849]  Yeah, there's overwhelming evidence that happened.
[00:09:59.869 --> 00:10:00.749]  People can look into it.
[00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.631]  When they would come out and see Al Qaeda's fake, the government runs it, boom, you'd have a heart attack next day.
[00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:07.372]  So yeah, no, I mean, they kill people all the time.
[00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:08.993]  I mean, you had Dr. David Kelly.
[00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:12.214]  Shit, they've told me I'll be killed and found in the woods if I tell you, but it's all fake.
[00:10:12.234 --> 00:10:13.054]  There's no WMDs.
[00:10:13.094 --> 00:10:16.956]  And then a guy walking his dog sees five guys in black uniforms leaving the body, running away.
[00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:19.237]  The wrists are slit, no blood at the scene.
[00:10:19.457 --> 00:10:22.178]  Then they say he took pills and died, but two undissolved pills were in his stomach.
[00:10:23.072 --> 00:10:27.176]  This one comes to you from, forgive me if I can't say it right, Vthom, I think.
[00:10:28.116 --> 00:10:36.283]  Alex, I've heard you mention some things about Ronald Reagan's assassination attempt and the medical care he received afterwards that somehow diminished his mental capacity.
[00:10:36.684 --> 00:10:38.726]  I've been unable to find anything else on this.
[00:10:38.766 --> 00:10:40.287]  Could you expand on the topic a bit?
[00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:42.189]  Maybe provide a resource material?
[00:10:42.349 --> 00:10:44.350]  Well, here's the good news and the bad news.
[00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.914]  I'm not looking at these questions beforehand.
[00:10:47.994 --> 00:10:51.680]  Sometimes she'll ask me a question about one of them because she wants to know before we go to them.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.268]  But I have not seen your questions so I don't have time to go look up the stuff because if we did we'd never even get to this.
[00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:00.453]  Multiple guests over the years.
[00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:08.180]  I think TV news pieces were done at the time that, you know, Reagan was incapacitated a few weeks because of some cold blood he was given.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.083]  And if you do that, it can cause kind of like an overall stroke-like effect in the brain.
[00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:18.928]  The fact that he would be asleep for days and then suddenly be animated, and the word is they use that to kind of get control of him medically.
[00:11:19.108 --> 00:11:20.229]  But we should look into that.
[00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:28.416]  Perhaps you can do it, Christy, for next time, so we can like put a star and then come back and say, before we get to new questions, let's go to a question from last time.
[00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:33.580]  Yeah, we're going to have to do kind of a recap of some past episodes where we finalized some answers there.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.243]  Yeah, because again, I mean, I already said it.
[00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:43.008]  The problem is I can't sit here and then have a documented, bibliographed answer every time.
[00:11:43.028 --> 00:11:45.530]  Well, no, none of it's on the fly.
[00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:46.271]  None of it's on the fly.
[00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:46.852]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:11:47.592 --> 00:11:48.833]  This next one comes to you from Glenn.
[00:11:48.893 --> 00:11:50.654]  He says, smoking used to be ubiquitous.
[00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:51.755]  It was everywhere.
[00:11:51.815 --> 00:11:54.417]  TV, billboards, movies, even in comic books.
[00:11:54.978 --> 00:11:57.680]  Smokers are some of the most stubborn people I know.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.003]  In your opinion, is smoking a beta test for getting rid of an individual's rights?
[00:12:02.984 --> 00:12:03.625]  Yes, it is.
[00:12:03.865 --> 00:12:11.574]  I mean, it was Edward Bernays and other propagandists that helped sell that, you know, be radical, be a feminist, smoke cigarettes in the 20s and 30s, liberty torches.
[00:12:12.255 --> 00:12:17.781]  And then the system decided, you know, for whatever reason, okay, well, we can kill them through vaccines and GMO.
[00:12:18.382 --> 00:12:21.926]  Let's have the test to ban something that people know is unhealthy.
[00:12:23.257 --> 00:12:27.780]  And the next it's popcorn, milk products and soft drinks and salt.
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.261]  Now, not in New York, but spreading all over.
[00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:35.405]  So it's kind of a globalist system where they try to get standardized laws all over the world.
[00:12:35.465 --> 00:12:36.906]  And yes, it was undoubtedly a beta test.
[00:12:37.452 --> 00:12:42.055]  I mean, they're one of the oldest men in the world, over 105 years old, smokes a pack of cigarettes every day.
[00:12:42.456 --> 00:12:43.457]  I'm not saying it's good.
[00:12:43.537 --> 00:12:45.238]  Genetically, some people can handle it.
[00:12:45.618 --> 00:12:46.839]  Other people, it's a death warrant.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.102]  Not a good idea to be pulling a bunch of dirty smoke.
[00:12:50.362 --> 00:12:51.262]  It's not just the tobacco.
[00:12:51.302 --> 00:12:55.546]  They add hundreds of chemicals into those things to make them more addictive, to make you smoke more.
[00:12:56.546 --> 00:12:59.669]  So, you know, the weird thing is I've always smoked on and off.
[00:12:59.729 --> 00:13:00.990]  Cigars, cigarettes, you name it.
[00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:01.850]  I'm a big tobacco guy.
[00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:06.715]  But one time for six years I quit where suddenly it stunk and I didn't like it.
[00:13:07.315 --> 00:13:11.359]  And finally again about a year ago I quit and now it stinks and it's horrible I have no desire for it.
[00:13:11.939 --> 00:13:19.305]  So it's like thank God I actually prayed to get me off those things and it happened because now when I smell somebody smoking a cigarette makes me want to throw up.
[00:13:19.946 --> 00:13:25.250]  I used to wonder why I'd be outside a restaurant or something smoking a cigarette and people walk by go oh we got to smell your smoke I'd get mad at them.
[00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:29.054]  But now I really get it it's like as I smell it it just smells like
[00:13:29.847 --> 00:13:31.708]  It's interesting what knowledge does to you, too.
[00:13:31.808 --> 00:13:36.651]  I mean, the more you learn about how bad something is, you, like, cultivate this desire to really get rid of it.
[00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:40.733]  I mean, the idea of, like, what it does to your lungs, or how it affects your body.
[00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:43.655]  Oh, it's, well, it's also, you know how many radioactive isotopes are in it?
[00:13:43.795 --> 00:13:44.556]  Oh, I don't even, I don't.
[00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:56.423]  I didn't even know this, but, like, somehow, it's strange, the tobacco puts, it's weird, people can look it up, it sounds crazy, but I had, during Fukushima, I'd already quit smoking, so it's over a year now, but I had,
[00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:00.961]  Nuclear physicist Dr. Bob Bowman on the show.
[00:14:01.662 --> 00:14:03.482]  He was like, well, don't worry too much about Fukushima.
[00:14:03.502 --> 00:14:04.602]  They're getting a lot of radiation.
[00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:07.523]  But what we get is less than somebody that smokes cigarettes for a few years.
[00:14:08.083 --> 00:14:10.523]  He goes, you know, you get all these rads off of smoking.
[00:14:10.543 --> 00:14:11.923]  And I went and I thought, that's crazy.
[00:14:11.943 --> 00:14:12.644]  So I'm looking it up.
[00:14:13.024 --> 00:14:14.464]  I didn't know it was like well known.
[00:14:15.284 --> 00:14:16.684]  The tobacco, I guess.
[00:14:17.304 --> 00:14:17.864]  Side issue.
[00:14:17.884 --> 00:14:18.625]  Go ahead to the next point.
[00:14:18.645 --> 00:14:19.625]  Yeah, no, it's fascinating.
[00:14:19.745 --> 00:14:21.185]  We're obviously going to get through 50.
[00:14:21.225 --> 00:14:21.485]  Let's do 20.
[00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:22.185]  We'll do 25 tomorrow.
[00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:23.365]  OK, well, what's the next one?
[00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:29.567]  This one is actually a more complex question.
[00:14:29.587 --> 00:14:32.748]  It says, Allied governments are covering up non-HIV cases.
[00:14:33.588 --> 00:14:38.829]  And this girl actually, her name is Kayla, and she says, like mine, under the chronic fatigue syndrome.
[00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:45.811]  And how can HIV deemed to cause AIDS when there are millions of non-HIV AIDS cases?
[00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:48.212]  And I actually researched a little bit of this on my own.
[00:14:48.252 --> 00:14:54.314]  In 1993, the CBC actually said that if your T cell count is less than 200, then
[00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:57.910]  You have HIV.
[00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.072]  And so it skyrocketed, those number of cases.
[00:15:02.253 --> 00:15:05.615]  So, I mean... Yeah, you don't have the virus, but you have an autoimmune disorder.
[00:15:05.695 --> 00:15:05.956]  Right.
[00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:11.079]  Which is actually things they've done through different vaccines, foods, and things.
[00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:15.062]  They're actually engineering it, and it's a very complex issue.
[00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:19.685]  And then HIV is really the cover for other bioweapons they're running in Africa.
[00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:25.449]  I mean, why is it that the BBC even had to admit, like a decade ago, that they went and checked all these women, young women that had
[00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:30.126]  HIV and they checked him and they'd never had intercourse.
[00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:34.589]  So, how did they have HIV?
[00:15:34.609 --> 00:15:38.211]  And they said, well, it must have been dirty needles in the vaccine process.
[00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:46.396]  So, how is it that someone in the West can have hundreds of partners and not get it, but people that haven't ever had any partners, oh, they're having a lot of sex over in Africa.
[00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:48.477]  No, no, no, they're shooting them up with it.
[00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:51.319]  And then with it is a trace virus.
[00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:54.961]  HIV, which they're always claiming is changing.
[00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:58.804]  It's just a covered excuse for bioweapons operations that are going on.
[00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:02.786]  So it's a very sophisticated, very sophisticated topic.
[00:16:03.126 --> 00:16:03.387]  Yeah.
[00:16:03.727 --> 00:16:08.070]  Something about it expanded to like pneumonia, like all the STDs.
[00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.071]  I mean, it was like a huge, huge situation.
[00:16:10.111 --> 00:16:10.932]  That'd be an interesting one.
[00:16:10.992 --> 00:16:12.853]  It's just a general cover name.
[00:16:13.213 --> 00:16:17.076]  And then Big Pharma sells a bunch of drugs to people that are like chemo drugs that kill them.
[00:16:17.256 --> 00:16:20.847]  Yeah, AZT was actually like the number one causing killer for liver.
[00:16:20.987 --> 00:16:23.354]  Like, your liver would fail if you took AZT back in the 80s.
[00:16:23.755 --> 00:16:23.896]  Yeah.
[00:16:24.315 --> 00:16:25.996]  Anyways, sorry, side note.
[00:16:27.017 --> 00:16:31.580]  This is actually kind of a combination of questions, but it's along the same topic.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.443]  It's from Blade Runner, an authoritarian hater.
[00:16:35.683 --> 00:16:40.387]  So, when I tell sheeple about aspartame and smart meters, they all look at me like I'm nuts.
[00:16:40.847 --> 00:16:44.970]  So, their answer to my aspartame warning is, yeah, right, I feel fine.
[00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.511]  I don't have rashes, headaches, etc.
[00:16:47.372 --> 00:16:48.292]  So how do I explain it?
[00:16:48.973 --> 00:16:50.033]  The same with the smart meters.
[00:16:50.053 --> 00:16:54.035]  They don't believe me, and they say so, and then they tell me to prove it.
[00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:59.278]  And it seems to me like they just want to contradict the idea that it's so out there.
[00:16:59.358 --> 00:16:59.758]  Sure, sure.
[00:16:59.778 --> 00:17:01.859]  They've been given hypnotic programming.
[00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:03.740]  This is on record through the television.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.361]  They're in a near-dreamlike state.
[00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:09.563]  When you upset them out of their trance state, they get upset and say, prove it, prove it.
[00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:11.364]  And even if you prove it, they don't want to hear it.
[00:17:11.384 --> 00:17:11.864]  Right.
[00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:14.885]  I mean, it's admitted aspartame is causing all these medical problems.
[00:17:14.945 --> 00:17:15.606]  It's not debated.
[00:17:16.306 --> 00:17:18.049]  Back in the 80s when they approved it, they knew that.
[00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:24.558]  It's not debated there's a world government, but they'll still laugh at you and say it doesn't exist, even though it's in the newspapers.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.203]  And people like that are just damaged goods.
[00:17:28.223 --> 00:17:29.905]  You gotta move on past them.
[00:17:31.027 --> 00:17:37.109]  Because they're so afraid at a subconscious level, and they've been so programmed, they're going to put up a defense.
[00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:40.390]  It's like an obsessive, compulsive thing.
[00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:45.472]  And a lot of them think you're showing off when you try to warn them, because they would never try to warn anybody.
[00:17:45.492 --> 00:17:49.233]  They've got such a low self-image that they don't care about warning others.
[00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:52.494]  So they think you're showing off to them, and like they're pathetic.
[00:17:53.394 --> 00:17:58.596]  And it's also a childlike delusionalism, where they think if they deny something magically it goes away.
[00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:05.191]  So there's a lot of psychological things, and they are sad little victims, that we gotta triage them.
[00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:09.952]  We try to warn them, don't feel bad when they attack you, move on to the next zombie.
[00:18:10.012 --> 00:18:14.393]  Some zombies have not succumbed to the full zombie-osis yet, okay?
[00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:18.275]  And so you just have to move on from that person to the next person.
[00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:20.775]  Okay, this one I can't help, I've gotta move on.
[00:18:20.795 --> 00:18:21.415]  That's awesome.
[00:18:21.756 --> 00:18:23.096]  Yeah, keep moving forward, I like that.
[00:18:23.888 --> 00:18:30.512]  But it's not just zombies, and there's vampire control agents, to use a popular term, who are like into the evil.
[00:18:30.532 --> 00:18:32.913]  They know something's going on, like moths to flame.
[00:18:32.933 --> 00:18:36.215]  They want to serve it like Renfield, as if they're going to get out of it by doing that.
[00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:37.675]  And they know they can manipulate.
[00:18:37.696 --> 00:18:38.836]  They know the public's asleep.
[00:18:39.236 --> 00:18:47.481]  And they're swimming around like a vampire eel around the unconscious person, going, don't wake him up, like a little bulldog swimming around him.
[00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:54.562]  Loving the fact that they're on, and they can program them, getting off on the power that they have a sleeping person they can manipulate.
[00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:55.882]  You understand that?
[00:18:55.902 --> 00:18:58.063]  So many sci-fi movies just popped into my head right now.
[00:18:58.083 --> 00:19:08.245]  Well, I mean, there's so many levels to this, but there's a lot of yuppies and people that are into the, like, oh, I can make money and be powerful in the system, but, but they're, they're asleep at another level as well.
[00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:12.525]  It's only master, you know, social engineer level that has the whole image in their mind.
[00:19:12.765 --> 00:19:15.306]  It's a desire for truth that I think people are truly scared of.
[00:19:16.403 --> 00:19:18.464]  All right, so this comes from Jisk.
[00:19:19.545 --> 00:19:21.566]  He actually wrote an accompanying article for it.
[00:19:21.626 --> 00:19:22.886]  I'll reference it here in a second.
[00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:27.468]  He says, have you looked into Leo Wanta and these trillions of dollars?
[00:19:27.608 --> 00:19:28.089]  Not true.
[00:19:28.189 --> 00:19:28.609]  Not real.
[00:19:28.809 --> 00:19:29.429]  It's not true.
[00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:29.930]  Not true.
[00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:30.410]  Not real.
[00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.210]  Well, there you go.
[00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:31.750]  There you have it.
[00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:37.753]  I mean, I mean, I mean, yeah, it's not as real as the Easter Bunny.
[00:19:37.773 --> 00:19:39.534]  I mean, you know, it's not as real.
[00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:40.455]  I love talking about Easter Bunny.
[00:19:40.475 --> 00:19:41.235]  It's an old joke.
[00:19:41.255 --> 00:19:42.495]  You always make me giggle when you say that.
[00:19:42.676 --> 00:19:43.256]  Whatever.
[00:19:43.276 --> 00:19:43.836]  I overdo it.
[00:19:43.856 --> 00:19:44.957]  The point is so ridiculous.
[00:19:46.232 --> 00:19:48.493]  It's as real as those Nigerian letters you get in the mail.
[00:19:49.474 --> 00:19:49.734]  Okay.
[00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:51.555]  The scammish idea.
[00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:52.695]  Well, maybe they're real.
[00:19:52.835 --> 00:19:56.317]  I mean, people, I've had people call me up and go, Hey, I got this Nigerian letter.
[00:19:56.337 --> 00:19:57.357]  They're offering me a million dollars.
[00:19:57.397 --> 00:19:58.258]  I pay them 5,000.
[00:19:58.298 --> 00:19:59.418]  They want to believe their ships come in.
[00:20:00.139 --> 00:20:02.240]  And I go, no, that's about a 10 year old internet scam.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:02.780]  It's not real.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.622]  And I've had families, distant families say, no, my million is here.
[00:20:06.642 --> 00:20:07.182]  I'm sending my 5,000.
[00:20:07.622 --> 00:20:12.685]  And then you send your 5,000 and then you get the, you get the email back on.
[00:20:12.765 --> 00:20:13.645]  Oh, that wasn't quite enough.
[00:20:13.665 --> 00:20:14.186]  5,000 more is needed.
[00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:17.403]  And sometimes they do four or five payments.
[00:20:17.984 --> 00:20:20.906]  And you know who they're angry at after they get ripped off?
[00:20:21.226 --> 00:20:21.987]  You for telling them.
[00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:24.389]  They're not angry at the Nigerian scammer.
[00:20:24.869 --> 00:20:27.772]  Because they always get emailed that Prince Habib got arrested.
[00:20:27.792 --> 00:20:29.393]  Of course.
[00:20:29.513 --> 00:20:32.415]  I mean, it wasn't that he couldn't... Prince Habib got arrested.
[00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:37.679]  People, once they're getting scammed, they just get deeper and deeper into the fraud.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.421]  Yeah.
[00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:42.663]  I mean, and that's what they want.
[00:20:42.683 --> 00:20:43.144]  It's what they get.
[00:20:43.916 --> 00:20:55.823]  This next one comes to you from John, and he says, Alex, did you know that in the big re-education camp PDF that you discovered weeks ago, there was a section where they talk about the Army squatting community centers.
[00:20:56.183 --> 00:21:01.486]  Can you clarify what a FEMA DRC, Disaster Recovery Center, actually is?
[00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:03.387]  There's actually one located near me.
[00:21:04.551 --> 00:21:08.834]  Well, again, there are real disasters, there's real reasons for this.
[00:21:08.874 --> 00:21:13.258]  So they kind of cluster real issues of hurricanes, earthquakes within it.
[00:21:13.318 --> 00:21:13.898]  That's part of it.
[00:21:14.278 --> 00:21:17.741]  And then it just has takeover of local government, gun confiscation.
[00:21:18.722 --> 00:21:22.204]  So there's some legitimate functions, and that's how they always sell it.
[00:21:22.224 --> 00:21:25.567]  Kind of like the Army does Jaws of Life for car wrecks.
[00:21:25.587 --> 00:21:27.068]  Like, well, are you against the Army being here?
[00:21:27.088 --> 00:21:28.269]  They're just helping this poor man.
[00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:29.130]  Yeah.
[00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.812]  Are you against the Air Force spraying mosquitoes in Florida?
[00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.692]  That's our military getting the job done.
[00:21:35.393 --> 00:21:42.162]  So there's just this mission creep where it's just an acclamation and they do things that they think are going to be popular up front.
[00:21:42.522 --> 00:21:44.184]  So the troops feel good being in the community.
[00:21:44.545 --> 00:21:45.846]  The troops being brainwashed too.
[00:21:46.968 --> 00:21:49.931]  So it's just a conditioning process for the police, the military, the public.
[00:21:50.252 --> 00:21:51.173]  We're all in the same boat.
[00:21:51.493 --> 00:21:51.694]  Yeah.
[00:21:52.765 --> 00:21:55.287]  Well, this next one actually comes to you from Freedom Angel.
[00:21:55.987 --> 00:21:58.409]  What do you know about Project Athena?
[00:21:58.689 --> 00:22:04.913]  How come Catherine Albrecht never talked about it being from MIT as she had some dealings with them?
[00:22:06.054 --> 00:22:06.815]  I have no idea.
[00:22:07.215 --> 00:22:08.075]  You'll have to look into this.
[00:22:08.456 --> 00:22:09.556]  We'll star that question.
[00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:13.119]  Might as well ask me about Lucky Charms or something.
[00:22:13.139 --> 00:22:15.320]  Sometimes they jump over the rainbow.
[00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:17.482]  Yeah, no, I mean, all that was Greek.
[00:22:18.044 --> 00:22:28.067]  All right, well, this next one comes to you from Tori, and she says, why do some states like Texas have state guards, and how powerful are they in relation to the police departments, the regular military?
[00:22:28.087 --> 00:22:29.387]  Ooh, that's a good question.
[00:22:29.407 --> 00:22:31.888]  Yeah, you kind of touched on that today in today's show.
[00:22:32.028 --> 00:22:35.149]  I heard you say something about state police or something to that effect, so.
[00:22:35.449 --> 00:22:37.730]  Well, I mean, I'm actually trying to work on a piece on this.
[00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:39.750]  It's funny that they asked that question.
[00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.051]  That's the original vestigial
[00:22:44.207 --> 00:22:45.690]  Shadow of the state militia.
[00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:51.122]  Because all the state militia was they demonized in the news was a posse or a civil defense.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:23:02.543]  So that if the sheriff, who's elected, needs a group of people for fires or for whatever, he can go around and find out, or she can go around and find out, whoever they think's good, and whoever's willing to get something done.
[00:23:02.943 --> 00:23:06.384]  Hey, you know, you got bulldozers, there's fires coming this way, get over here.
[00:23:06.764 --> 00:23:09.185]  You know, get on the radio, get on local radio, TV.
[00:23:09.485 --> 00:23:10.966]  Back in the old days, you know, ride on your horse.
[00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:12.446]  Hey, get down here, we need help.
[00:23:12.486 --> 00:23:14.647]  You know, get your buckets, the town's on fire.
[00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:19.468]  And so, states have guards, and then they also have the National Guard.
[00:23:19.768 --> 00:23:22.449]  Originally it was state guards, then they set up National Guard, it was under the governors.
[00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:27.871]  Now they've basically federalized those, where they're federal, so they're even getting rid of the state, having it's quote, National Guard.
[00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:30.352]  And so, it's really what's left of the militia.
[00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:34.842]  Awesome, that's actually really informative.
[00:23:35.142 --> 00:23:38.083]  Mitsteer E is this user.
[00:23:38.463 --> 00:23:43.085]  What do you think about Romney saying no congressional approval needed to bomb Iran?
[00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:44.705]  And he's not alone in saying that.
[00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:46.786]  Hey, he likes Obama's health care.
[00:23:47.606 --> 00:23:49.347]  He says he's against it, but he helped write it.
[00:23:49.647 --> 00:23:53.308]  But we've got to do what the Supreme Court said and the IRS taxing us isn't a tax.
[00:23:54.128 --> 00:23:55.529]  And it's a standard NDAA.
[00:23:55.569 --> 00:24:02.914]  He supports secret arrest, drone killing, endless war, warrantless wiretappings, open borders, carbon taxes.
[00:24:03.315 --> 00:24:05.416]  He's bought and paid for by the exact same people.
[00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:10.920]  Bain's given double the money that he's part owner of and used to head to Obama than they even gave him.
[00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.571]  I don't think so.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.860]  Yeah, of course.
[00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:37.742]  Do you see that cartoon we had on InfoWars today?
[00:24:38.002 --> 00:24:42.403]  It was the sheep and it was like, whichever way you choose, and it all funneled into the same place.
[00:24:42.703 --> 00:24:44.144]  I didn't see it, but yeah.
[00:24:44.164 --> 00:24:45.124]  It fits into that.
[00:24:45.685 --> 00:24:54.228]  Vaughn comes to you and he asks, Alex, I'm curious to get your take on the inevitable emerging cloning technology and the implications on society.
[00:24:56.434 --> 00:25:01.857]  Well, clones have inherent genetic problems, and it's all part of humanity playing God.
[00:25:02.857 --> 00:25:18.504]  Just like an iPhone has tech built into it that you pay for when you buy it to spy on you, the globalists have said with their medical tyranny that they're not going to give us any, like they sterilize us, but then come and say we have a technology so you can have a child.
[00:25:18.944 --> 00:25:21.566]  But then they're going to get rid of traits that are bad in the child.
[00:25:22.286 --> 00:25:24.347]  That means build into it what they want.
[00:25:25.819 --> 00:25:43.466]  And so this whole thing is a medical mad scientist tyranny and it's Strap yourselves in we're gonna see some very very crazy times, but we should do a whole special on cloning because we're already eating clone meat milk from clone cows They're doing cross-species weird clones.
[00:25:43.506 --> 00:25:49.388]  I mean it's the sky's the limit we're living in this planet is like a giant biological weapons experiment or something and
[00:25:50.697 --> 00:25:51.798]  Yeah, you don't know what's real anymore.
[00:25:52.898 --> 00:25:55.799]  Glitch says, as a child I read Prisoners of Power.
[00:25:55.839 --> 00:25:58.420]  It's a sci-fi book written by a Russian duo.
[00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:01.902]  And the brothers back in the night, they wrote it in the 1960s.
[00:26:02.282 --> 00:26:06.324]  Since then, I've read the book many times, discovering new aspects of the world that they painted.
[00:26:06.744 --> 00:26:12.308]  In 2010 and 2011, the biggest sci-fi movie ever made in Russia came out in two parts.
[00:26:12.849 --> 00:26:18.353]  The name of the movie was Inhabited Island, and essentially the story parallels many of today's trends.
[00:26:18.453 --> 00:26:25.379]  So probably some of the most notable of them are radiation towers affecting people's minds, propaganda, brainwash, etc.
[00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:30.683]  So, uh, I'm not... Sorry, I kind of lost my question.
[00:26:31.926 --> 00:26:34.551]  Can we find other articles that are like that?
[00:26:34.591 --> 00:26:38.137]  Is there any other sci-fi movie or anything else that you've seen?
[00:26:38.838 --> 00:26:42.304]  I've noticed articles that, you know, we see a cartoon that it's painted the future, etc.
[00:26:43.749 --> 00:26:46.270]  Yeah, I mean, all these movies and culture show a dystopia.
[00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.830]  It's like, just get ready for it.
[00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:48.610]  That's what happens.
[00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.791]  In the future, the government says, how many kids you can have?
[00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:56.693]  In the future, you're going to be watched and controlled, because eugenicists developed most of the modern technologies we have.
[00:26:56.733 --> 00:26:57.313]  They steered them.
[00:26:57.333 --> 00:26:57.973]  They controlled them.
[00:26:58.734 --> 00:27:04.035]  Robber barons and royalty believed in all this, so they've built the culture we're in, and this is the world they're taking us to.
[00:27:04.875 --> 00:27:07.476]  I haven't seen that film or read that book, but it sounds intriguing.
[00:27:07.696 --> 00:27:07.956]  Yeah.
[00:27:08.417 --> 00:27:09.637]  Well, maybe we'll follow up with that, too.
[00:27:12.111 --> 00:27:21.577]  Everyone, this is from Freedom Spear, and he says, everyone knows that having preventative medicine, surgery and dental work, whatever, is not an inalienable right.
[00:27:21.597 --> 00:27:24.158]  And we actually touched on that in one of the last Ask Alex segments.
[00:27:24.718 --> 00:27:30.722]  Moreover, passing a law that mandates purchasing such services, products, anything else is completely unconstitutional and very illegal.
[00:27:31.022 --> 00:27:31.742]  Again, we've covered it.
[00:27:32.263 --> 00:27:40.167]  What organization or enforcement arm has the authority to arrest the Supreme Court justices responsible for this illegal activity?
[00:27:41.348 --> 00:27:42.768]  Congress can defund them.
[00:27:43.949 --> 00:27:47.090]  Congress, it's not really a separation of powers the way we've been taught.
[00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.411]  Congress is dominant, then there's the courts, then there's the executive.
[00:27:51.891 --> 00:27:57.152]  So there's a separation of powers, but because Congress is 500 plus people, it's got the real power.
[00:27:57.172 --> 00:28:06.035]  And that's why the globalists have sold it out and gotten it to be weakened and transferred into nine justices they can control and one president and then a bureaucracy.
[00:28:07.353 --> 00:28:12.137]  But it's up to the states to nullify and not follow and fight.
[00:28:12.157 --> 00:28:13.359]  It's up to us individually.
[00:28:13.379 --> 00:28:18.283]  Because it's not like they're trying to give free health care to people that others pay for.
[00:28:18.664 --> 00:28:22.988]  These are eugenicist tyrants that are now using this to control people.
[00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:25.671]  So that's the main issue with the health care takeover.
[00:28:27.881 --> 00:28:30.682]  The next one is from Thomas, and he says... And what's the bottom one?
[00:28:30.882 --> 00:28:32.463]  We'll do this page, we'll do the other half tomorrow.
[00:28:32.743 --> 00:28:33.543]  Oh, okay.
[00:28:33.604 --> 00:28:34.844]  We'll do 24, that's just about half.
[00:28:35.424 --> 00:28:37.285]  Yeah, we'll finish this page.
[00:28:38.005 --> 00:28:40.527]  I said I'd do 50, but my goodness gracious.
[00:28:40.547 --> 00:28:41.707]  Hey, I'm moving quick, though.
[00:28:41.727 --> 00:28:42.467]  I'm very impressed.
[00:28:42.527 --> 00:28:44.068]  I feel like I'm being interrogated, though.
[00:28:44.488 --> 00:28:45.069]  Where's the light?
[00:28:45.109 --> 00:28:45.669]  Right over your head.
[00:28:46.489 --> 00:28:51.751]  If you don't, this is from Thomas, and he says, if you don't know your history, you're doomed to repeat it, which I think is valid.
[00:28:52.111 --> 00:28:58.413]  My question is, you started talking about Vietnam, Yugoslavian wars, etc., and what was the real cause, I was wondering?
[00:28:58.473 --> 00:29:04.916]  And I understood the breaking news about the New World Order every day, but I would love to hear a history lesson from your perspective.
[00:29:07.196 --> 00:29:10.078]  Well, it's not that the communists in Vietnam were good guys.
[00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:13.321]  Ho Chi Minh came to the CIA and the U.S.
[00:29:13.361 --> 00:29:16.724]  government said, I want to set up a system with you, a free system.
[00:29:17.364 --> 00:29:21.828]  And they said, no, we're going to have the corrupt narcotics traffickers in the South still run things.
[00:29:21.848 --> 00:29:22.569]  We're going to prop up.
[00:29:23.407 --> 00:29:25.948]  You know, the Indochina French model.
[00:29:27.168 --> 00:29:28.849]  And so they turned against us.
[00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:35.192]  And CIA staged bombings to blame the North to get the war going and put advisors in in 1960, early 59, and the rest is history.
[00:29:39.153 --> 00:29:45.998]  But does it mean, you know, the Chinese then backing the Northern Vietnamese, that doesn't mean they're good.
[00:29:46.038 --> 00:29:49.380]  It's like, just because our government's corrupt doesn't mean Iran's good.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.202]  It's like corruption across the board.
[00:29:52.142 --> 00:29:55.385]  As for Yugoslavia, I mean, you have Tito, who was a balancing force.
[00:29:55.425 --> 00:29:56.826]  They get rid of him, they break it up.
[00:29:57.466 --> 00:30:00.268]  They engage in the bombing of Belgrade with the depleted uranium.
[00:30:00.308 --> 00:30:05.451]  I mean, it's all just about destroying nation states that the bankers don't control.
[00:30:05.912 --> 00:30:12.016]  And as bad as Assad is in Syria or Gaddafi was in Libya, they're putting something far worse in.
[00:30:12.036 --> 00:30:20.321]  So when you hear about, oh, freedom fighters are trying to protest, it's al-Qaeda blowing up police stations and lining up black people in Libya and shooting them.
[00:30:20.882 --> 00:30:23.443]  And the media is like, oh, this guy might have said a word.
[00:30:23.463 --> 00:30:24.484]  We better fire him.
[00:30:24.744 --> 00:30:26.325]  But, oh, you're lining up blacks and shooting them?
[00:30:26.345 --> 00:30:27.046]  Well, that's nice.
[00:30:28.867 --> 00:30:30.728]  Bill Gates has a shot for the little black child.
[00:30:31.468 --> 00:30:33.529]  George Bush is hugging one of the child's crying.
[00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:36.711]  You know it's all just an AFRICOM invasion PR.
[00:30:36.731 --> 00:30:50.659]  Yeah they've done actually studies where the government has proven that you know they had this skepticism of advertising working and I studied a case study in college on it and it was basically they they went in with the idea that it doesn't work but obviously they know it works and
[00:30:51.411 --> 00:30:52.352]  I don't know.
[00:31:07.714 --> 00:31:09.975]  I mean, people will be like, my God, Alex, this is ridiculous.
[00:31:09.995 --> 00:31:12.616]  But then it's George Bush and the photos everywhere.
[00:31:12.636 --> 00:31:16.978]  Meanwhile, AFRICOM is running and just slaughtering everybody, arming the dictators.
[00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:23.421]  And they're doing it in North Africa and South Africa, thousands of miles from Kony, who hadn't been seen in five years.
[00:31:24.322 --> 00:31:25.903]  And they admit, oh, yeah, it's transparent.
[00:31:26.003 --> 00:31:28.584]  I mean, it's just like... Right.
[00:31:28.724 --> 00:31:36.728]  I mean, the UN is in Africa, in Uganda, where they're talking about Kony, on record lining up people and killing whole villages to take their property.
[00:31:37.731 --> 00:31:40.593]  And you go tell a trendy, they're like, look, dude, I got tattoos.
[00:31:40.754 --> 00:31:41.414]  I got all this.
[00:31:41.434 --> 00:31:42.635]  I'm like, OK, I don't care if you got tattoos.
[00:31:42.655 --> 00:31:44.116]  I'm not against those.
[00:31:44.176 --> 00:31:44.937]  I'm dressed trendy.
[00:31:45.938 --> 00:31:47.319]  Don't tell me he's not cool.
[00:31:47.339 --> 00:31:48.720]  And I'm like, but it's slaughtering people.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.523]  They go, dude, your hair does not look like mine.
[00:31:52.563 --> 00:31:55.326]  And I'm just like, OK, I understand you're super trendy and everything.
[00:31:55.366 --> 00:31:57.107]  But, you know, I mean, come on.
[00:31:57.568 --> 00:32:01.051]  It's just like they're like, look, I choose to believe we're helping Africa.
[00:32:01.071 --> 00:32:01.751]  And I'm just like, OK.
[00:32:02.872 --> 00:32:03.833]  Like, be quiet, racist.
[00:32:04.614 --> 00:32:04.954]  Yeah.
[00:32:05.595 --> 00:32:07.175]  And she's like, OK, all right.
[00:32:07.215 --> 00:32:10.397]  I mean, it's buying into the delusion.
[00:32:10.437 --> 00:32:11.478]  It's like, I'm a winner.
[00:32:11.498 --> 00:32:13.258]  I buy into the propaganda.
[00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:16.160]  The next question comes to you from Husband and Dad.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.040]  That's the username.
[00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:22.263]  Alex, you present yourself extremely well as a benchmark of civil disobedience.
[00:32:22.623 --> 00:32:28.306]  And there is a large number, there are a large number of activists that would do better if they were just a bit more civil.
[00:32:28.706 --> 00:32:31.908]  So could you, in your own words, define civil disobedience?
[00:32:34.841 --> 00:32:43.509]  Well, I don't think I'm the benchmark of anything really, but maybe alternative media success, but that's just because a lot of people aren't trying.
[00:32:46.532 --> 00:32:50.996]  Civil disobedience just means you're not Molov cocktailing the police station.
[00:32:52.237 --> 00:33:00.224]  Instead, you're saying no to things that are clearly wrong and kind of peacefully sabotaging the system and putting yourself against the machinery.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.521]  Very succinct.
[00:33:02.541 --> 00:33:03.201]  I like that.
[00:33:04.342 --> 00:33:09.887]  Charles asks you, he says, Alex, my question is, can we abolish the Fed without the government's help?
[00:33:10.348 --> 00:33:11.188]  Or is it impossible?
[00:33:12.369 --> 00:33:15.953]  Yes, just like people are abolishing GMO foods by demanding organic.
[00:33:16.553 --> 00:33:19.216]  And none of it's perfect, but there's a process there, voting with dollars.
[00:33:19.236 --> 00:33:25.581]  That's why they want to get a tyranny in, because they're scared if we just vote with our dollars and our actions and the little things we do, it's over for them.
[00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:26.202]  It's game over.
[00:33:26.442 --> 00:33:26.783]  Absolutely.
[00:33:30.672 --> 00:33:37.340]  Yes, if everybody started doing more barter, that's why they're attacking all these little farms and Amish and these community co-ops, things that really scares them.
[00:33:38.461 --> 00:33:40.644]  Getting back to old-fashioned activities in any way.
[00:33:42.642 --> 00:33:44.762]  Women, men, learning how to make their own clothes.
[00:33:45.183 --> 00:33:46.743]  That's one of the biggest things that scares the system.
[00:33:46.763 --> 00:33:49.583]  I say that because you said your mom made that nice coat you got.
[00:33:49.963 --> 00:33:52.604]  Jacket, sports jacket, whatever you call it.
[00:33:53.244 --> 00:33:54.604]  I mean, they're really scared of that.
[00:33:54.664 --> 00:33:57.605]  Just the idea of little things cuts into their monopoly.
[00:33:58.965 --> 00:34:02.946]  Picture the New World Order as this giant box store that basically resorbs you or absorbs you.
[00:34:04.226 --> 00:34:05.266]  So, what was the question?
[00:34:05.986 --> 00:34:09.287]  It was just, you know, how to be civil, disobedient.
[00:34:09.607 --> 00:34:10.067]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:34:11.152 --> 00:34:12.092]  Oh no, that was the last question.
[00:34:12.173 --> 00:34:13.093]  I'm so sorry.
[00:34:13.373 --> 00:34:16.374]  Destroying the Fed without intervention from the government.
[00:34:16.394 --> 00:34:17.455]  You just criticize it.
[00:34:17.475 --> 00:34:18.936]  You expose it as a private fraud.
[00:34:18.976 --> 00:34:20.596]  That it's the biggest welfare recipient.
[00:34:21.036 --> 00:34:22.797]  That it's taken over our country and the world.
[00:34:22.817 --> 00:34:24.338]  That they brag they've conquered us.
[00:34:24.358 --> 00:34:25.518]  Look how arrogant they are.
[00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.560]  And using local alternative currencies.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.901]  They've got all sorts of them all over the country, all over the world.
[00:34:32.442 --> 00:34:33.582]  And just realizing they're the enemy.
[00:34:33.602 --> 00:34:35.703]  You know, Obama comes.
[00:34:36.904 --> 00:34:38.024]  Politicians come and go.
[00:34:38.064 --> 00:34:39.945]  But still the big fat bankers are sitting there.
[00:34:41.235 --> 00:34:41.655]  I like that.
[00:34:41.915 --> 00:34:42.295]  Barter.
[00:34:42.436 --> 00:34:45.397]  Well, the Civil Rights Movement was a huge part of that.
[00:34:45.437 --> 00:34:47.398]  They withdrew from riding the buses.
[00:34:47.978 --> 00:34:49.498]  And then they started... Well, exactly.
[00:34:49.658 --> 00:34:52.980]  And also supporting local businesses.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.921]  And it doesn't mean you're a purist, because you can't be.
[00:34:54.941 --> 00:34:57.762]  I mean, you can't buy a locally made...
[00:35:00.358 --> 00:35:01.659]  Electro voice microphone.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.462]  I think that's made in Germany or Japan.
[00:35:03.482 --> 00:35:04.543]  I mean, this is made in Germany.
[00:35:05.905 --> 00:35:07.206]  And nothing against the Germans.
[00:35:07.226 --> 00:35:08.308]  This is actually a quality product.
[00:35:08.328 --> 00:35:11.532]  We actually hire some workers that actually, you know, get something out of it, which is good.
[00:35:11.572 --> 00:35:12.553]  They put back in the economy.
[00:35:13.814 --> 00:35:16.478]  But buying local really does do something.
[00:35:18.272 --> 00:35:28.902]  If fractional reserve banking would be replaced by another system, what would it be replaced with?
[00:35:29.182 --> 00:35:31.625]  For example, an interest-free monetary system?
[00:35:31.645 --> 00:35:32.906]  Would that work in practice?
[00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:35.236]  We debated that.
[00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:37.437]  It could be interest-free from state banks.
[00:35:37.457 --> 00:35:39.778]  I don't know about a federal bank, because that can always get taken over.
[00:35:39.798 --> 00:35:43.220]  But if you had state banks, they've had some big successes with that.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:54.845]  And that's what we talked about in the first question, or one of the first, was this issue where people go, well, you've got Tarpley on, who's for an interest-free system, but by a big federal bank, the Hamiltonian model.
[00:35:55.066 --> 00:36:00.468]  And then you've got Ron Paul on over here, who is talking about gold or silver back.
[00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:03.971]  Any of these systems can be manipulated and gamed.
[00:36:04.331 --> 00:36:10.796]  It's mainly about a debate and monetary, people being informed monetarily, so the system, because they can corrupt any system.
[00:36:11.196 --> 00:36:14.959]  But if the people are informed about monetary systems, that gives a leg up against it.
[00:36:16.263 --> 00:36:19.966]  Knowledge is where you start, and then it's action from there that's leading to.
[00:36:20.886 --> 00:36:30.913]  Warwick asks, Alex, mainstream media is now openly reporting horrific things such as the idea of afterbirth abortion, thousands of elderly people being intentionally killed.
[00:36:32.154 --> 00:36:33.495]  Is this mainstream news?
[00:36:35.677 --> 00:36:38.298]  Ultimately, he's asking, is this showing that we're winning?
[00:36:38.438 --> 00:36:42.862]  Like, they're actually reporting on something that we find to be true?
[00:36:42.882 --> 00:36:44.623]  Or are they just kind of throwing us a bone?
[00:36:45.905 --> 00:36:50.528]  I used to think that all this stuff coming out was victories.
[00:36:51.049 --> 00:36:53.250]  And it's a mixed bag.
[00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:56.332]  Sometimes a reporter gets it through, an editor says it's the right thing to do.
[00:36:56.913 --> 00:37:03.577]  And I think, I don't think, I know in the last decade, that last five or six years, that really started where people went out and did real reporting.
[00:37:04.017 --> 00:37:10.342]  Their boss backed them, because maybe the newspaper editors knew World Order, but now their kid's autistic, they figure out this is important.
[00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:11.743]  They allow it out.
[00:37:11.843 --> 00:37:14.385]  So more and more people started getting the truth out.
[00:37:14.745 --> 00:37:17.747]  So the system kind of just went, OK, yeah, we're going to kill all people.
[00:37:17.767 --> 00:37:18.348]  What's the big deal?
[00:37:18.368 --> 00:37:20.409]  Yeah, we're going to kill kids up to age three if we want.
[00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.894]  So it's people telling the truth and hitting the barbed wire to get the truth out.
[00:37:25.914 --> 00:37:28.256]  That is a victory.
[00:37:28.276 --> 00:37:29.797]  But there's also a lot of just acclimating.
[00:37:30.738 --> 00:37:31.959]  Oh, you want the truth to come out?
[00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:32.239]  Yeah.
[00:37:32.399 --> 00:37:33.240]  Open the floodgates.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.962]  And suddenly in hundreds of papers, we're run by foreign banks.
[00:37:36.102 --> 00:37:36.983]  We're your slaves.
[00:37:37.363 --> 00:37:38.764]  You've been conquered by world government.
[00:37:38.784 --> 00:37:39.805]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:37:40.751 --> 00:37:46.096]  So see, it's kind of like the system's gone from denying all this because they realized people weren't listening to them.
[00:37:46.116 --> 00:37:49.458]  It was discrediting them, denying things.
[00:37:49.819 --> 00:37:52.421]  So they've kind of just gone to a now open the floodgates.
[00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:54.222]  Oh, you think there's some tyranny?
[00:37:54.262 --> 00:37:56.264]  Yeah, this is what you didn't know was going on.
[00:37:56.304 --> 00:37:57.225]  What you gonna do about that?
[00:37:58.366 --> 00:38:00.628]  You're like, oh my God, there's hell itself right there.
[00:38:00.648 --> 00:38:01.569]  And they're like, yeah.
[00:38:02.469 --> 00:38:04.371]  So it's a lot of things.
[00:38:04.951 --> 00:38:07.313]  And also their agenda now is moving into light speed.
[00:38:07.694 --> 00:38:09.035]  So they can't hide it anymore.
[00:38:09.448 --> 00:38:12.248]  You know, they also do this in a monotone voice, if you notice.
[00:38:12.268 --> 00:38:15.229]  Yeah, they don't want you being emotional.
[00:38:15.949 --> 00:38:20.450]  I was never successful on purpose, whereas I wasn't angry.
[00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.570]  They're always like, don't get upset in politics.
[00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:23.930]  Be calm.
[00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:25.351]  That's how you get through to people.
[00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:26.331]  Bullcrap.
[00:38:26.911 --> 00:38:36.473]  When everybody is in a drone, mesmerized state, they need to be awakened by it, by having their survival mechanisms in their mind activated.
[00:38:36.733 --> 00:38:38.553]  And I'm a guy hopping around like a dog barking.
[00:38:39.053 --> 00:38:48.577]  I mean, it'd be like if robbers were breaking into your house, you get up and they're crowbarring up in your garage or whatever, your car, and you look at the German Shepherd and you go, shut up, I can't believe you were barking.
[00:38:48.938 --> 00:38:51.059]  That is so extreme of you to be barking at them.
[00:38:51.459 --> 00:38:54.740]  You know, we get upset and motivated for a reason.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.562]  So I'm kind of like, rrr, rrr, rrr, rrr.
[00:38:57.582 --> 00:39:00.183]  They're like, no, no, no, that's not how you get through to people.
[00:39:00.203 --> 00:39:02.704]  Everybody's like in a zombie state of sleep, and I'm like, rrr.
[00:39:04.212 --> 00:39:05.975]  And they're like, no, that's extreme.
[00:39:06.376 --> 00:39:07.418]  Don't listen to him.
[00:39:07.498 --> 00:39:09.542]  There is nothing going on out there.
[00:39:15.234 --> 00:39:24.100]  I See the Future user asks you, in 1998 the movie Ants shows grass lawn made into exact shapes of New York twin Tin Tower skyline.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.622]  How does Hollywood know of false flag years in advance?
[00:39:27.982 --> 00:39:29.103]  Obviously it's all kind of coordinated.
[00:39:29.223 --> 00:39:37.569]  I haven't seen that clip, but there are literally, no exaggeration, 60, 70, I was about to say hundreds, it's probably in the hundreds, of news articles, things about pre 9-11.
[00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:41.771]  And the worst example, best example, it's horrible, is
[00:39:43.163 --> 00:39:50.605]  Fox Television had the lone gunman spinoff of that big hit show they had, X-Files.
[00:39:51.726 --> 00:40:03.449]  And in it, the government hijacks a jumbo passenger jet to fly to the World Trade Centers to blame it on Afghanistan, and they use a drill to claim that hijackers got on board to cover up the fact that it's really remote controlled.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.201]  Now that's exactly what happened six months later.
[00:40:06.841 --> 00:40:18.125]  So I'm pointing out this is a government op, and then I get a call, Dean Hagelin, the star of the show, he's in the X-Files too, wants to come to my house and talk to me, and he shows up, it's Dean Hagelin from television, and he goes, yeah, the CIA approach disimplanted that story.
[00:40:18.465 --> 00:40:19.206]  They did it with others.
[00:40:19.266 --> 00:40:20.046]  Well, I mean, obviously.
[00:40:20.566 --> 00:40:21.666]  Why do they do that then?
[00:40:22.107 --> 00:40:23.647]  It's like a pre-programming thing?
[00:40:23.827 --> 00:40:25.528]  Ties back into that news idea.
[00:40:26.502 --> 00:40:39.533]  Yes, so subconsciously you're ready for it, but also it's a message so the bankers that run the CIA, they can say to the Russians and others, we're not going to say who did 9-11, but did you see Fox's lone gunman?
[00:40:40.614 --> 00:40:42.395]  Don't play games with us, okay?
[00:40:42.415 --> 00:40:43.576]  If we'll do that, we'll do anything.
[00:40:43.596 --> 00:40:44.917]  We're ready for nuclear war with you.
[00:40:45.278 --> 00:40:49.081]  You submit and do what we want and you shoot your people up with cancer viruses or you're all dead too.
[00:40:50.222 --> 00:40:54.866]  So they put these in messages, so they can go, we're not going to tell you what we're going to do, but have you seen this movie?
[00:40:55.306 --> 00:40:57.488]  How many other movies we make come true?
[00:40:58.629 --> 00:41:00.671]  And I saw this with Gary Hart.
[00:41:02.472 --> 00:41:08.217]  I saw this with Gary Hart when he wrote a letter to Ahmadinejad saying, we've staged terror attacks before, we'll do it again.
[00:41:08.257 --> 00:41:09.358]  He published it in the Huffington Post.
[00:41:09.818 --> 00:41:15.363]  And when Luke Radowsky, or it was other folks we interviewed, I forget, but it's in our film, Truth Rising.
[00:41:17.401 --> 00:41:17.921]  They confront him.
[00:41:17.941 --> 00:41:18.682]  He goes, I didn't write that.
[00:41:18.702 --> 00:41:20.022]  When they pull the letter, he goes, oh, I did.
[00:41:20.062 --> 00:41:20.803]  But it's immaculate.
[00:41:20.823 --> 00:41:22.163]  He's sweating and freaking out.
[00:41:22.483 --> 00:41:23.784]  Like, I got one that can see.
[00:41:23.824 --> 00:41:25.285]  He couldn't believe that was happening.
[00:41:26.165 --> 00:41:28.806]  I mean, that's a really great question right there that they just asked.
[00:41:29.027 --> 00:41:30.107]  What's the last one for today?
[00:41:30.127 --> 00:41:31.368]  26 tomorrow.
[00:41:31.688 --> 00:41:34.809]  I just did 24, and I'm going to go shoot the news right now.
[00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.650]  No rest for the wicked.
[00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:37.651]  I didn't know I was this wicked.
[00:41:38.775 --> 00:41:42.538]  Alright, so Sovereign Think asks you, this is the last question so this is technically 24.
[00:41:43.399 --> 00:41:46.561]  What are your thoughts on the NSTIC program?
[00:41:47.022 --> 00:41:48.283]  Is it dangerous as I think?
[00:41:48.343 --> 00:41:52.086]  Is it as dangerous as I think required biometric access for the internet?
[00:41:54.208 --> 00:42:05.877]  Five years, three or four years ago they already had that built into the new Microsoft stuff and that's what they plan is an internet ID so they can tax you, track you, trace you and Google's already changing stuff so they know who you really are.
[00:42:05.897 --> 00:42:08.259]  You have multiple accounts so they can ban you from the internet.
[00:42:09.042 --> 00:42:10.243]  I'm not familiar with it.
[00:42:10.283 --> 00:42:11.783]  Is it like a thumbprint situation?
[00:42:11.803 --> 00:42:15.345]  Yeah, they're going to make you thumbprint and face scan to buy and sell, get on the internet, you name it.
[00:42:15.365 --> 00:42:18.906]  If you're not a good globalist, you can't travel, you can't live, you can't do anything.
[00:42:19.186 --> 00:42:20.607]  And people will be like, I don't want to help you.
[00:42:20.647 --> 00:42:21.988]  They'll turn my ID off.
[00:42:22.568 --> 00:42:23.728]  And so it'll be the ultimate fear.
[00:42:23.748 --> 00:42:26.210]  And if they get to that point, it's going to be devastating.
[00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.130]  Like, I can't upload Alex Jones videos.
[00:42:28.531 --> 00:42:29.511]  He's been banned before.
[00:42:29.591 --> 00:42:32.312]  And if you do, you get banned from the system.
[00:42:32.372 --> 00:42:34.153]  I need my creds on my card.
[00:42:34.193 --> 00:42:35.354]  And I need it.
[00:42:35.434 --> 00:42:35.914]  I need it.
[00:42:36.553 --> 00:42:40.564]  So I mean, it is absolute takeover by that little criminal Bill Gates.
[00:42:42.385 --> 00:42:43.586]  And that is a hell of a way to end it.
[00:42:43.626 --> 00:42:45.828]  I want to start back with that when I'm fresh tomorrow.
[00:42:45.848 --> 00:42:47.470]  Alright, we'll just reissue that.
[00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.973]  We'll start over with 24 because that is an incredibly important question.
[00:42:51.393 --> 00:42:52.134]  All of them were great.
[00:42:52.474 --> 00:42:54.496]  PlanetinfoWars.com.
[00:42:54.836 --> 00:42:55.316]  Go there.
[00:42:55.436 --> 00:42:55.697]  Meet.
[00:42:56.017 --> 00:42:57.458]  Use the web while we've still got it.
[00:42:57.899 --> 00:42:58.519]  Organize.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.843]  It's in beta, but it's working a lot better than it was a few months ago when we first launched it.
[00:43:02.863 --> 00:43:03.383]  Absolutely.
[00:43:03.463 --> 00:43:04.284]  Spread the word about it.
[00:43:04.324 --> 00:43:05.645]  Make your own YouTube videos about it.
