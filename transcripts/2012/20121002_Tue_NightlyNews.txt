[00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:16.465]  It's time for you men to stand up in the info room.
[00:00:40.892 --> 00:00:42.573]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:43.893]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:47.294]  This is what we have in store for you for this Tuesday, October 2nd, 2012 edition.
[00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.451]  Tonight, U.S.
[00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:59.316]  Army characterizes people frustrated with mainstream ideologies as terrorists.
[00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:03.980]  Then, 5 million volt cattle prod developed for crowd control.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.924]  And Richard Belzer talks to Jakari Jackson about his book, Dead Wrong.
[00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:11.446]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:21.837 --> 00:01:22.337]  Welcome back.
[00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:23.858]  Top story headline.
[00:01:24.278 --> 00:01:24.498]  U.S.
[00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:28.479]  characterizes people frustrated with mainstream ideologies as terrorists.
[00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:32.720]  Just another in the long laundry list of reasons that you would be a terrorist.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080]  You see the article there.
[00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:39.902]  It talks about how they also frame people who believe in government conspiracies as violent radicals.
[00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:42.843]  We've seen in recent weeks everything from
[00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:45.585]  Bumper stickers to paying with cash.
[00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:50.228]  I mean, just the list goes on and on, reasons that you would be a terrorist.
[00:01:50.608 --> 00:02:05.178]  And there's one thing in particular, if we could freeze it right there, guys, that they talk about in the article, how being socially awkward, I guess, is some type of potential terrorist, terrorism activity, but also using social networks.
[00:02:05.618 --> 00:02:11.579]  So let's say you're a shy guy, you live out in a ranch, or you're out in an apartment by yourself, it's you and the dog and you want to mind your own business.
[00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:20.221]  That means you're a potential terrorist, but also if you like to micromanage your entire life for everybody to see on Twitter, that also makes you a terrorist.
[00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:29.223]  So that along with paying cash and wearing blue jeans, and if you burn yourself curling your hair, ladies, that would make you a terrorist as well.
[00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:33.164]  So just, it's more of the same that we keep seeing.
[00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:39.028]  Every week there's another reason that you're a terrorist, so go ahead and keep tweeting, you dirty terrorist.
[00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:51.698]  And actually that reminds me of an article, you guys won't have to rush to pull this up, but Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York, Twitter surrendered their tweets to the NYPD.
[00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:57.383]  So if you think everything's sacred, well we know if you put stuff on the internet it's pretty much there forever anyway.
[00:02:58.462 --> 00:03:00.688]  But Twitter surrendered.
[00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:02.673]  It wasn't the cops who went and dug all this stuff up.
[00:03:02.693 --> 00:03:07.344]  Twitter surrendered, occupied Wall Street protesters' tweets.
[00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:08.915]  To the NYPD.
[00:03:38.314 --> 00:03:42.940]  Professor says drones will soon be able to kill without human assistance.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.524]  So, I mean, does it get any scarier than that?
[00:03:47.124 --> 00:03:54.933]  Ronald Arkin, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, believes that drones will soon be able to kill enemies on their own, independently.
[00:03:55.414 --> 00:03:56.555]  This is just a few weeks.
[00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:57.736]  Actually, I think it was last week.
[00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:02.120]  I reported on how the Pentagon does not trust their own robots.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.883]  So we go from last week, the Pentagon doesn't trust their own robots.
[00:04:05.923 --> 00:04:12.408]  It was last week because Marcos made that swank graphic of the robots stomping on the Pentagon.
[00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:19.654]  So they don't trust their own robots at the Pentagon, but they feel, hey, it's fine for these things to fly themselves, pick their own targets.
[00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:21.676]  And the reason they do this is because
[00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:23.617]  Then they don't have anybody to blame.
[00:04:23.957 --> 00:04:30.241]  So the next time a drone goes and knocks out an entire wedding party to kill two guys, oh, it's a malfunction.
[00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:39.846]  Or the next time a drone knocks down an entire apartment complex of 100 people, apartment building of 100 people, to kill maybe two guys who may have done something, it's a malfunction.
[00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:46.030]  And it's also saying that drone operators are getting post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.150]  That, I mean, this is a real article.
[00:04:49.251 --> 00:05:06.835]  Drone operators get Post Traumatic Stress Disorder because they're feeling guilty about killing their targets because they scope out their targets, they follow them around for however many hours or days until they take them out, and they get to know them, kind of like a reality show, I guess you would say, and then they kill them, but they say, hey, you didn't kill that guy, the drone killed him.
[00:05:07.195 --> 00:05:09.336]  So there is, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:12.757]  Yes, if you killed somebody in a drone, you killed them, and hey, that's on you.
[00:05:13.577 --> 00:05:13.957]  There you go.
[00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:17.860]  Uh, they're getting pretty stressed, uh, killing people with those drones.
[00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:20.924]  But don't worry, they'll replace you anyway soon.
[00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:22.265]  Next story.
[00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:27.510]  5 million, 5 million volt cattle prod deployed for crowd control.
[00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:28.812]  Wow!
[00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:30.874]  I mean, I thought crowd control was a...
[00:05:31.448 --> 00:05:34.291]  Was a, you know, steel gate or something you dropped on the ground.
[00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:38.274]  But no, it's a 5 million volts.
[00:05:38.514 --> 00:05:39.775]  And you see the video right there.
[00:05:39.795 --> 00:05:50.145]  The article goes in to say that this cattle prod, which is, you can see it right there, actually when a guy shocks the rod, it glitches the screen.
[00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:51.986]  That's how powerful this thing is.
[00:05:52.287 --> 00:05:53.848]  But if you compare this to a taser,
[00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:00.993]  Which is about 50,000 volts, compared to this one, which is 5 million volts.
[00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:03.555]  I mean, you can see a stark contrast.
[00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:17.044]  And the guy in the video, and we'll show that clip here in one second, he says, if you grab any part of this rod, it's not just the tip of it, I mean, if you grab any part of the rod, it will shock you with 5 million volts, the guy says.
[00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:20.286]  It leaves you incapacitated for up to 20 minutes.
[00:06:20.306 --> 00:06:21.647]  So let's take a look at that clip now.
[00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:22.528]  Battlefrog.
[00:06:22.808 --> 00:06:23.589]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:24.149]  Do it.
[00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:27.204]  I can see it's glitching the screen.
[00:06:27.224 --> 00:06:28.045]  What is important about this?
[00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:40.984]  Well, this is the first, uh, industry and world's first rifle mountable, weapon mountable, stun baton, non-lethal, gives you instant non-lethal on your very lethal weapon for subject, non-lethal subject, and crowd control.
[00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:58.348]  And speaking of tasing and cattle prods, we have a clip of Mr. Alex Jones being tasered in the film Scanner Darkly.
[00:06:58.388 --> 00:06:59.169]  Let's take a look at that.
[00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:01.969]  Where did Substance D come from?
[00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.390]  Why can't we stop it?
[00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.131]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose, the more Substance D is on our streets!
[00:07:09.611 --> 00:07:10.851]  Can't you figure this out?
[00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:11.912]  Look around here!
[00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:13.752]  Look how far we've come!
[00:07:13.812 --> 00:07:16.373]  Humanity wasn't meant to live like this!
[00:07:16.493 --> 00:07:19.773]  Our every waking moment traps and traits and scams!
[00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:22.194]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:07:22.294 --> 00:07:24.294]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.675]  Uh-oh, it's our tax dollars at work!
[00:07:27.668 --> 00:07:29.770]  Hey guys, I used to be one of you!
[00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.851]  Stop selling out your own species!
[00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:33.873]  Ah, there we go.
[00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:37.676]  I feel safer knowing that Alex Jones got tased.
[00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:38.717]  Whoa, man.
[00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:42.480]  Okay, so I feel safer knowing that Alex Jones got tased.
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.902]  Even in that fictional clip, that makes me feel better.
[00:07:46.003 --> 00:07:54.008]  So going from tasers and cattle prods, we'll go now to a different type of control, a RFID chip.
[00:07:54.668 --> 00:08:04.174]  Melissa Melton and I had a chance to go down to San Antonio, Texas last week, and when we weren't being questioned by the NSA, we managed to get out to a student RFID protest.
[00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:06.616]  You know, they're trying to track the kids down there.
[00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:11.038]  One young brave lady is standing up against the tyranny, and this is her story.
[00:08:11.098 --> 00:08:12.039]  Let's take a look at this clip now.
[00:08:20.515 --> 00:08:22.916]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:08:23.516 --> 00:08:35.940]  Although we have all been conditioned to accept that technology will be spying on us all the time in this police state control grid we now find ourselves living in, families here in San Antonio, Texas are standing up against this intrusion on their privacy and freedom.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:42.903]  Protesting the RFID tracking chips the school district here is forcing students to wear just so that they can attend school.
[00:08:43.443 --> 00:08:46.384]  Mr. Hernandez, why did you organize this protest here today?
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.023]  Well, the reason I organized this is because I'm protesting these RFID tracking chips.
[00:08:51.483 --> 00:08:52.724]  The children don't need to be tracked.
[00:08:53.384 --> 00:08:57.127]  You know, and it steps on my religious freedom and the religious freedom of my children and my family.
[00:08:57.147 --> 00:08:59.748]  Then there's other things you can look at.
[00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:01.590]  Civil liberties, rights, privacy.
[00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.012]  All these things, they didn't take into account when they implemented this program.
[00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.914]  And for us, first and foremost, it's our religious freedom.
[00:09:09.094 --> 00:09:11.156]  That's our fight, and they're trying to take it away from us.
[00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:18.449]  And you told me just a second ago that your daughter has actually been threatened with recourse by the schools for this protest?
[00:09:18.689 --> 00:09:19.470]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.772]  What they told me on the 20th of September, they offered us a compromise.
[00:09:23.832 --> 00:09:27.774]  And the compromise was that they would allow her to wear a badge that didn't have a chip in it.
[00:09:28.654 --> 00:09:32.816]  But she had to fall in line like the rest of them and show support for the program.
[00:09:33.497 --> 00:09:36.638]  So the Constitution ends once students step foot on school property?
[00:09:36.938 --> 00:09:37.519]  Pretty much for them.
[00:09:37.539 --> 00:09:38.139]  Yes, ma'am, it does.
[00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:42.137]  Why do you feel that wearing the RFID chips is a bad thing?
[00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:45.000]  Well, I feel it's an invasion of my religious beliefs.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.123]  I feel that it's the implementation of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:09:48.184 --> 00:09:53.730]  I feel that it's an invasion of my privacy and it's an invasion of all my rights as a citizen.
[00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.010]  Does this in any way make you feel safer?
[00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.131]  No, it doesn't.
[00:09:58.191 --> 00:10:07.416]  It actually bothers me a whole lot and I feel completely unsafe knowing that this can be hacked by pedophiles and dangerous offenders that live around my area because I walk home.
[00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:11.258]  Dangerous offenders can pick up on my signal and, you know, anybody.
[00:10:11.898 --> 00:10:13.059]  My name is John Henry Liberty.
[00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:14.700]  I'm a congressional candidate for U.S.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.881]  House of Representatives, District 21 of Texas.
[00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:20.883]  And why did you attend this protest on RFID tracking chips today?
[00:10:21.448 --> 00:10:23.030]  Because I find the program to be abhorrent.
[00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.874]  This is a textbook case of Orwellian authoritarianism in action.
[00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:32.579]  Tracking our children is not going to solve the problem that they want it to solve.
[00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:34.580]  And it's just going to cost us $500,000.
[00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:39.865]  They say it's cost neutral, but really this still costs us $500,000 and then $136,000 annually to keep it up.
[00:10:39.886 --> 00:10:40.967]  And this is money that's allocated for education.
[00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:47.074]  Don't ship me bro!
[00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:48.597]  Don't ship me bro!
[00:10:52.588 --> 00:10:58.110]  When protesters decided to take their concerns inside, the school board attempted to silence them.
[00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.752]  The RFID chip issue was not even an included item on the night's agenda.
[00:11:03.232 --> 00:11:11.776]  And although many community members turned up to voice their concerns, the board would only allow five people to speak on the issue for only three minutes apiece.
[00:11:12.176 --> 00:11:17.278]  The board may not provide a public forum for every citizen wishing to express an opinion on a matter.
[00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:25.455]  It is my recommendation to the board that we do limit some of those people.
[00:11:25.475 --> 00:11:29.758]  They don't want to hear from us because they know that we're right.
[00:11:29.938 --> 00:11:32.820]  This is absurd and we're going to fight them now more than ever.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.921]  You want to talk about history?
[00:11:35.201 --> 00:11:38.323]  We know that the Jews were tattooed during the Holocaust.
[00:11:38.543 --> 00:11:39.524]  What are you doing here?
[00:11:40.183 --> 00:11:48.285]  I think that until we have a health impact study that determines that it is safe for our children, we should not be subjecting them to experimental technology.
[00:11:49.265 --> 00:11:51.946]  Everything about this screams Orwellian authoritarianism.
[00:11:53.026 --> 00:11:54.867]  It is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:11:55.287 --> 00:11:57.328]  It is a violation of these students' rights to privacy.
[00:11:57.768 --> 00:11:58.688]  Bottom line is this.
[00:11:59.228 --> 00:12:00.969]  My daughter has rights, okay?
[00:12:01.689 --> 00:12:04.530]  You can't reinstate rights to her that she already has.
[00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.270]  She has rights.
[00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.491]  None of you up here can ask us
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.342]  To give up our religious freedom.
[00:12:13.343 --> 00:12:19.889]  Finally, and most importantly, is the disgusting abuse of power resulting in the violation of these students' religious freedom.
[00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:21.171]  And it's not just Andrea.
[00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:31.381]  This program and the expressed consequences with not falling in line with it have created a chilling effect in the students in these schools and making them afraid to stand up for themselves.
[00:12:31.806 --> 00:12:33.327]  What they're doing to the people is wrong.
[00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:34.628]  And you know what?
[00:12:34.848 --> 00:12:36.029]  Now I'm going to fight even harder.
[00:12:36.049 --> 00:12:38.090]  And you're going to see my face postured everywhere.
[00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.893]  I'm going to come at them like a bull in a glass china shop.
[00:12:42.113 --> 00:12:42.993]  I'm coming at them now.
[00:12:43.254 --> 00:12:44.835]  They're going to regret what they just did to us.
[00:12:47.051 --> 00:13:00.638]  In a time more and more when we're being tracked, traced, and controlled at our every step, organizations such as schools are using children as test subjects for these RFID programs because they know they're easy targets for police state control conditioning.
[00:13:01.298 --> 00:13:10.843]  But as the parents you saw here today at this protest, we need to stand up against this and stand up for our freedom and our rights to liberty before we don't have any freedom left.
[00:13:11.443 --> 00:13:14.025]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:13:14.713 --> 00:13:23.081]  I'd really like to see more parents come down, more students come down and fight this, because this is something that's going to affect not just these school districts, but all school districts in Texas.
[00:13:23.421 --> 00:13:29.507]  This is setting a precedence that is acceptable to treat children like cattle, and that just cannot stand.
[00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:43.135]  So there you go, a mighty fine report from Melissa Melton with a little camera work from myself.
[00:13:43.836 --> 00:13:45.859]  I'm particularly proud of it.
[00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:50.204]  The money shot seems to be the lady on the school board or whatever she is.
[00:13:50.224 --> 00:13:51.166]  She's making all those faces.
[00:13:54.109 --> 00:13:56.811]  But, yeah, it was a good protest.
[00:13:56.851 --> 00:13:58.992]  We met a lot of good patriots out there.
[00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:11.460]  Some of those people, if you want to go juxtapose that, some of those people were in, I think it was, either David Ortiz's or Dan Badondi's piece when they went down to San Antonio and they were asking people, is that a protest or something?
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.541]  I don't think it was the Alamo video, it was another video.
[00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:16.183]  So you can check that out as well, and we'll move on.
[00:14:17.003 --> 00:14:18.125]  Letter to Monsanto.
[00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:20.528]  Thank you for making the world better.
[00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:21.610]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.374]  Somebody takes time out of their day to thank Monsanto.
[00:14:24.414 --> 00:14:25.535]  I'll read a little bit of it here.
[00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:32.926]  Dear Monsanto, I want to write you this letter thanking you for all your hard work leading the food industry towards the future.
[00:14:33.287 --> 00:14:33.367]  Aww.
[00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:42.207]  I have seen some incredible things as of late and I believe that your efforts have been the main reason I and others have been so fortunate.
[00:14:42.547 --> 00:14:44.829]  Now obviously this is a satire piece.
[00:14:45.329 --> 00:14:51.614]  This is an incredible satire piece that you can find on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:52.054 --> 00:14:55.716]  And also on Planet InfoWars is where this actually originated.
[00:14:55.736 --> 00:15:00.299]  And if you take a look here, if you subscribe to Planet InfoWars up there in the corner, you can see it on your screen.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.200]  You can go to write articles.
[00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:07.284]  And then you may be featured right here on the InfoWars Nightly News or on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:07.304 --> 00:15:10.866]  And I think this article has actually been linked other places as well.
[00:15:10.906 --> 00:15:13.648]  So congratulations to you, Benjamin Lance.
[00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:15.369]  And hope to see more from you.
[00:15:15.469 --> 00:15:18.251]  And hey, if you want to get your article featured, submit yours as well.
[00:15:18.671 --> 00:15:19.912]  We'll move on to our next story.
[00:15:21.258 --> 00:15:26.522]  I don't think you should feed this to the calf, but you want to give this to a human baby?
[00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:27.262]  It's completely ridiculous.
[00:15:27.282 --> 00:15:27.842]  I want to read this line.
[00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:51.757]  Genetically modified, mutant, cloned cow.
[00:15:52.297 --> 00:15:54.157]  How much more ridiculous can you get?
[00:15:54.177 --> 00:15:56.057]  And I'm not talking about Mike Adams as the writer.
[00:15:56.097 --> 00:15:58.658]  I mean, that's really how you have to describe these things.
[00:15:58.938 --> 00:16:01.919]  Genetically modified, mutant, cloned cow.
[00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:11.320]  And when they're not, you know, making designer, trendy cows, they're feeding them gummy bears and sugar daddies and all other types of candy.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.821]  You can look that article up for yourself.
[00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:25.727]  But yeah, genetically modified cows, and they say even this cow in question was born without a tail, so maybe your child will be born without a finger or so.
[00:16:25.748 --> 00:16:33.512]  But hey, that's okay, because Monsanto loves you, and they're producing nice, wholesome, cloned cow's milk.
[00:16:33.852 --> 00:16:34.232]  We're good to go.
[00:16:51.102 --> 00:16:53.925]  Uh, big tumors that they can drag around like they gave to the rats.
[00:16:53.945 --> 00:16:56.287]  So, that ties in with our last article.
[00:16:56.367 --> 00:16:59.269]  And don't forget, Monsanto loves you very much.
[00:16:59.589 --> 00:17:02.812]  Please write them a letter, handwritten, so that they know that you really care.
[00:17:03.232 --> 00:17:03.773]  Next article.
[00:17:05.268 --> 00:17:07.390]  Dutch abortion boat heads to Morocco.
[00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.132]  This is a real story.
[00:17:10.573 --> 00:17:11.955]  I found this story this morning.
[00:17:12.075 --> 00:17:13.316]  I was like, is this true?
[00:17:13.656 --> 00:17:15.658]  They said, cancel your trip to Disney World.
[00:17:15.678 --> 00:17:17.019]  Cancel the Disney crew.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.004]  You can talk to Dan Badani and all the reasons why you shouldn't take a Disney cruise, but that's another issue.
[00:17:22.024 --> 00:17:23.246]  Let's take a look at the article.
[00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:32.449]  The organization, Women on Waves, provides abortion and contraceptive information outside territorial waters in countries where abortion is illegal.
[00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:41.313]  Over the past 11 years, a Women on Waves ship has arrived in Ireland, Poland, Portugal, and Spain, sparking protests
[00:17:42.694 --> 00:18:06.709]  They got this abortion boat that you can go on and I mean I don't like government telling people what to do but I am anti-abortion and it's I don't know who's regulating this for I mean for the ladies themselves who will go on this boat and put their health in the hands of whoever these people are I mean who's regulating to make sure that
[00:18:07.452 --> 00:18:15.017]  Even, I mean, I don't know if there's such thing as a reputable abortionist, but I mean, who's making sure that you're safe on this boat?
[00:18:15.357 --> 00:18:28.606]  That actually ties into something that if you guys missed the Alex Jones Radio Show today, we had Pastor Childress on from blackgenocide.org, where he broke down the history of abortion in this country, and let's take a look at that clip now.
[00:18:29.326 --> 00:18:31.868]  This racism has very well been disguised.
[00:18:32.552 --> 00:18:43.199]  And people, and I believe it's because, well, this is a two-party nation, I know, and Republican Party was begun to stop slavery and usually takes the higher ground.
[00:18:43.799 --> 00:19:00.349]  But in the black community, the deception has been that the Democratic Party, because of quote-unquote being liberal and more humanistic when it comes to their thinking politically, are not going to perpetrate racism when they've been the greatest advocates
[00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:05.334]  of racism, basically, this country's ever known, under deception.
[00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:10.857]  Now, the reason why that happens, though, is just like, believe it or not, what Malcolm X said.
[00:19:11.418 --> 00:19:14.480]  You know, you have the house Negro and you have the field Negro.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:29.750]  Well, Jake Jackson, Al Sharpton, the Congressional Black Caucus have somewhat become profiteers from this dilemma, this particular genocide that's been going on in our community.
[00:19:30.765 --> 00:19:32.606]  With abortion, but education also.
[00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:39.431]  And it is more or less there now just to keep African Americans in line and dumb to the truth.
[00:19:40.072 --> 00:19:49.358]  And your program is especially important in a program like this that will expose the truth of genocide, expose the true perpetrators of it.
[00:19:49.918 --> 00:19:52.660]  And unfortunately, our leadership has sold out.
[00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:55.502]  As Malcolm said, they have become house Negroes.
[00:19:55.562 --> 00:19:59.405]  I don't espouse the Muslim faith, but I do know truth when I hear it.
[00:20:00.018 --> 00:20:05.860]  And they are profiting from it and it's the main reason why Al Sharpton's on MSNBC.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:19.205]  These people basically are given a platform and African Americans by nature are very suspicious of any other source other than the sources that they have chosen for news.
[00:20:19.825 --> 00:20:22.186]  And so they infiltrate those sources.
[00:20:22.917 --> 00:20:27.719]  Um, and bought off the, as Margaret Sanger said, she'll hire a colored minister.
[00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:29.500]  Well, that's what basically has happened.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.241]  They've been hired, bought out, and the Holocaust continues.
[00:20:33.682 --> 00:20:37.103]  Educational Holocaust continues, and... So there you go.
[00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:39.004]  Excellent points by Pastor Childress.
[00:20:41.546 --> 00:20:46.710]  He's actually featured in a film we carry here in the Infowars store, titled Moffa 21.
[00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.753]  It's a history of black genocide in this country, so definitely take a look at that.
[00:20:51.093 --> 00:20:57.858]  And also, if you'd like to see more of Pastor Childress, you can check out PrisonPlanet.tv in the Special Reports Archive section.
[00:20:58.178 --> 00:21:00.960]  You can see a special interview with Pastor Childress.
[00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:04.003]  Just another reason, one of the many great reasons to join
[00:21:04.423 --> 00:21:05.524]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:06.704]  You support this broadcast.
[00:21:07.004 --> 00:21:09.966]  You get to see great special reports by guys from Pastor Childress.
[00:21:10.266 --> 00:21:11.727]  So hey, just take a look at that.
[00:21:12.027 --> 00:21:13.988]  That brings us now to our quote of the day.
[00:21:14.788 --> 00:21:15.889]  This one from JFK.
[00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:21.191]  Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.
[00:21:21.572 --> 00:21:22.912]  That's from JFK.
[00:21:23.232 --> 00:21:25.914]  That actually ties into where we're going next after this break.
[00:21:26.314 --> 00:21:32.537]  I have an interview with Mr. Richard Belzer as he discusses his book, Dead Wrong, and of many things.
[00:21:32.817 --> 00:21:34.138]  JFK is mentioned in that.
[00:21:34.498 --> 00:21:44.996]  So definitely stay tuned for that after this break and also stay tuned after the Belzer interview because I'll sit down with Aaron Dykes as he breaks down his special report of GMO foods at Whole Foods.
[00:21:45.257 --> 00:21:45.758]  Stay tuned.
[00:22:14.972 --> 00:22:19.496]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:25.641]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn about the incredible health effects of longevity products.
[00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:28.363]  Erin Dykes lost 92 pounds.
[00:22:28.743 --> 00:22:31.646]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[00:22:32.066 --> 00:22:33.848]  Aaron, break down what happened.
[00:22:33.868 --> 00:22:34.429]  Your story.
[00:22:34.709 --> 00:22:39.775]  I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get the results.
[00:22:39.815 --> 00:22:40.696]  It just didn't happen.
[00:22:40.997 --> 00:22:43.580]  Then I saw what you were doing with Infowarsteam.com.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.865]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[00:22:47.905 --> 00:22:48.285]  I wanted that
[00:22:48.605 --> 00:22:54.388]  I don't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals, but the products did that for me.
[00:22:54.728 --> 00:23:02.491]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods, and they don't even advertise it as weight loss!
[00:23:02.812 --> 00:23:06.353]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com.
[00:23:06.893 --> 00:23:12.116]  Sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing discounts at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:20.560]  My friends, Alex Jones here with a very important announcement.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.805]  We are launching a new salvo in the info war, because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:23:27.445 --> 00:23:33.571]  You know that the globalists are trying to get everybody online, and only online, so they can control and surveil information.
[00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:37.753]  And also erase books, videos, whatever they want to, en masse.
[00:23:38.473 --> 00:23:43.576]  That's why we're launching our answer to the internet kill switch, InfoWars Magazine.
[00:23:44.016 --> 00:23:50.459]  The first issue, we printed over 90,000 copies of the September issue, and it sold out in less than two days.
[00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:56.122]  So get your copy of the new technocratic elite issue today before it sells out.
[00:23:56.622 --> 00:24:02.165]  Again, we cover from the technocratic social engineers' own words, their own admissions, their plan
[00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:07.107]  To take over our society and replace us with robots.
[00:24:07.387 --> 00:24:10.909]  But we don't just stop with the rise of the robots and the end of humanity.
[00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:13.711]  Or, will humanity survive the singularity?
[00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:19.353]  We get into the government buying now 1.6 billion bullets against the American people.
[00:24:19.714 --> 00:24:25.396]  We get into Big Sis' surveillance of this magazine and my website, Infowars.com.
[00:24:25.837 --> 00:24:30.419]  We cover QE3 and what hyperinflation means to you and your family.
[00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:35.544]  Whatever you do, don't look back later and wish that you would have taken action.
[00:24:35.604 --> 00:24:36.726]  Take action now.
[00:24:36.846 --> 00:24:40.310]  People have never been more ready for this information.
[00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:44.314]  People have never been this hungry, starving for the truth.
[00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:49.080]  And it is contained in the new issue of InfoWars Magazine.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.782]  This is a time capsule.
[00:24:51.382 --> 00:24:53.164]  It is so important we get it out to everyone.
[00:24:53.565 --> 00:24:59.492]  If you subscribe now for 12 issues, we will give you the first issue absolutely free.
[00:24:59.552 --> 00:25:03.076]  So that's 13 issues for our 13 colonies.
[00:25:03.497 --> 00:25:05.539]  Part of restoring the spirit of 1776 worldwide.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:15.086]  Again, go to Infowarsstore.com and order 10 packs, up to 100 packs at cost and give them out to people in your area.
[00:25:15.386 --> 00:25:17.588]  The response last month was incredible.
[00:25:17.908 --> 00:25:22.231]  People are hungry to actually hold this information in their hands.
[00:25:23.292 --> 00:25:29.577]  You can also subscribe and get 12 issues delivered to your door and get the first inaugural issue free.
[00:25:30.517 --> 00:25:36.002]  I'm Alex Jones, thanking all of you for your support and making our operation a huge success.
[00:25:53.499 --> 00:25:54.140]  And welcome back.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.222]  Our guest tonight is Mr. Richard Belzer.
[00:25:56.382 --> 00:26:01.347]  He's an actor and comedian, best known for his work on the hit TV show Law & Order Special Victims Unit.
[00:26:01.748 --> 00:26:05.952]  He's also a writer who has written such works as UFOs, JFK, and Elvis.
[00:26:06.312 --> 00:26:09.175]  In his current work, Dead Wrong is available at the InfoWars store.
[00:26:09.476 --> 00:26:10.156]  He joins us now.
[00:26:10.357 --> 00:26:12.459]  Mr. Richard Belzer, thank you for joining us, Richard.
[00:26:12.879 --> 00:26:13.781]  Well, thanks for having me.
[00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:21.851]  I love doing the show and as I was saying to you off the air, last time I did Alex's show, my book sales spiked very heavily, so.
[00:26:22.512 --> 00:26:24.675]  Okay, can you tell us, how's the book doing?
[00:26:24.695 --> 00:26:25.596]  You said it's doing well.
[00:26:26.297 --> 00:26:28.360]  It was on the New York Times Best Seller list.
[00:26:29.361 --> 00:26:37.687]  For a moment, which I think is directly attributable to Alex, at least in part, and it's selling steadily and very well.
[00:26:38.127 --> 00:26:42.490]  I keep promoting it because I feel it's an important book.
[00:26:43.211 --> 00:26:46.913]  As we say, straight facts on the country's most controversial cover-ups.
[00:26:47.434 --> 00:26:52.177]  I think the public is ready for the truth about their government.
[00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:56.940]  We've been patronizing and information has been filtered too much.
[00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:03.663]  I was just really happy to have the book be put, it's in the history section, it's not a conspiracy book.
[00:27:04.023 --> 00:27:05.704]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:18.828]  Yeah, so it's going really well and I'm doing a lot of press this week and people are stopping me in the street and I'm giving it to some pretty heavy hitters, so it's really doing well.
[00:27:19.348 --> 00:27:20.529]  Great, I'm glad to hear that, Richard.
[00:27:20.849 --> 00:27:27.411]  Now to intro, can you tell us a little bit about the book and what prompted you to write it along with your co-writer, Mr. David Wayne?
[00:27:27.836 --> 00:27:42.061]  Yeah, David Wayne is a micro-analyst of media, meaning he has studied for at least 25-30 years how the media covers events like the JFK murder, the Martin Luther King murder, Vince Foster, and all these events.
[00:27:42.881 --> 00:27:44.802]  In our book are 10 cases
[00:27:45.382 --> 00:27:57.811]  That there was clearly cover-ups involved, and in most cases, murder by people, maybe not necessarily the government as an institution, but elements within the government.
[00:27:58.452 --> 00:28:12.222]  And we start with Frank Olson, who worked at the CIA and was a very bright guy, and who was witnessing, they were doing renditions then, by the way, you know, torture and
[00:28:14.163 --> 00:28:29.098]  He knew that we used anthrax in Korea or using LSD and torturing people and he was getting very upset about it and so they said that he committed suicide.
[00:28:29.739 --> 00:28:29.919]  Okay.
[00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:52.192]  So he was murdered because he was repelled at torture techniques that our government was using in the fifties.
[00:28:53.173 --> 00:28:56.014]  And we got a great letter from his son who thanked us.
[00:28:56.734 --> 00:29:03.236]  Frank Olson's son sent us a letter thanking us for what we wrote in the book about his dad and covering this information.
[00:29:03.796 --> 00:29:04.817]  It's pretty chilling stuff.
[00:29:04.837 --> 00:29:07.718]  And here's one footnote to this that I know everyone's going to
[00:29:10.409 --> 00:29:12.049]  Get a kick out of him.
[00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:12.950]  Sure.
[00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:20.913]  Okay, Cheney and Rumsfeld were working for President Ford when they made this settlement with Frank Olson's family.
[00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:24.834]  They were trying to suppress the information, but they finally paid the family $750,000.
[00:29:25.835 --> 00:29:26.455]  Wow.
[00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:33.077]  But it's Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld in the 70s, you know, hiding evil things from us.
[00:29:33.237 --> 00:29:34.438]  Oh yeah, they started early.
[00:29:34.818 --> 00:29:36.138]  These guys started early.
[00:29:36.478 --> 00:29:42.880]  But we also, in the book, I think, this is probably the first book that conclusively proves that Marilyn Monroe was murdered.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.401]  You know, people say she committed suicide or the Kennedys murdered her.
[00:29:47.761 --> 00:29:49.882]  The Kennedys didn't murder her, but she was murdered.
[00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:51.882]  There's no question about that.
[00:29:51.943 --> 00:29:55.603]  We've got forensic evidence and we've interviewed police that were on the scene.
[00:29:55.663 --> 00:30:01.005]  And that's what's so good about the book is that no one's been able to refute anything in it yet, which is very comforting.
[00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.212]  Now if I could interject for one second, Richie, you make a very interesting point.
[00:30:04.252 --> 00:30:05.933]  I like what you said about Miss Marilyn Monroe.
[00:30:06.453 --> 00:30:09.996]  Of all the people in your book, you have Dr. King and JFK.
[00:30:10.336 --> 00:30:16.681]  As popular as Marilyn is, the circumstances of her death are probably not as well known as the other people.
[00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:26.728]  So can you tell us a little bit about, I know your book says, that you say the first responders, they walk in the room and they say, this is not a suicide, this is a murder scene.
[00:30:27.068 --> 00:30:28.309]  Yeah, they said stage.
[00:30:28.569 --> 00:30:29.069]  It was stage.
[00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:39.196]  Yeah, the first officer on the scene just said, stay, this is stage, because they said that she took dozens of Nembutal, which is a sleeping pill.
[00:30:40.017 --> 00:30:46.061]  And as anyone knows, I mean, we've spoken to, we've gotten forensic evidence with, you know, the ME's reports.
[00:30:46.121 --> 00:30:47.923]  I mean, we did very extensive
[00:30:49.043 --> 00:30:59.052]  Research on this has been corroborated in multiple ways, but if you take Nembutal to commit suicide, you die before they're all digested.
[00:31:00.253 --> 00:31:03.675]  And there's crystals and there's stuff left in your intestines and stomach.
[00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.457]  Marilyn Monroe's stomach was empty.
[00:31:06.237 --> 00:31:07.138]  There was nothing in it.
[00:31:07.178 --> 00:31:10.541]  There were no crystals, there were no refractions from the pills.
[00:31:11.282 --> 00:31:14.004]  There were no injection marks on her body.
[00:31:14.464 --> 00:31:15.385]  There were bruises.
[00:31:15.865 --> 00:31:17.627]  When the first officer came into her room,
[00:31:18.067 --> 00:31:18.147]  Sure.
[00:31:33.926 --> 00:31:39.850]  And they said that she drank, you know, there was a glass next to her bed and empty pill bottles.
[00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.332]  Her bathroom sink was broken, so there was no source for her to have water.
[00:31:44.352 --> 00:31:48.174]  Her window in her bedroom was broken from the inside, not the outside.
[00:31:49.115 --> 00:31:52.537]  She was on the phone with a friend and said, I just heard something.
[00:31:52.937 --> 00:31:53.677]  Hold on a second.
[00:31:53.717 --> 00:31:54.818]  Never came back to the phone.
[00:31:55.378 --> 00:31:56.059]  So it's been
[00:31:57.654 --> 00:32:07.021]  Pretty much conclusively, well I'll say conclusive, that she was injected with an injectable enema, not the traditional enema, but more like a syringe type thing.
[00:32:07.722 --> 00:32:10.324]  She was given an enema, and that's what killed her.
[00:32:10.344 --> 00:32:20.692]  And she was killed to embarrass the Kennedys, because the plotters thought, okay, Marilyn Monroe committed suicide, it's the President's girlfriend, it'll be humiliation.
[00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:21.812]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:51.145]  Kennedy had nothing to do with the murder, but the fact that he was there that day, which they denied when we later found that a car was pulled over, and Kennedy was in the car that day, so the cop recognized him because it was his boss, the Attorney General.
[00:32:51.865 --> 00:32:52.925]  So, he was there.
[00:32:54.506 --> 00:33:04.349]  But he didn't kill, he had nothing to do with the murder, but the plotters, he'd been at the FBI or the mob, you know, the house bugged and they knew that he was an administrative or a killer,
[00:33:04.989 --> 00:33:07.911]  Make it look like a suicide, and then the Kennedys would get swept into it.
[00:33:08.431 --> 00:33:18.638]  So the Kennedys had to be involved in the cover-up, because if it was a murder, and the Attorney General was there that day, they didn't want the Attorney General being caught up in a murder investigation.
[00:33:19.098 --> 00:33:19.218]  Oh.
[00:33:19.899 --> 00:33:24.782]  They kind of were complicitous in making it look like a suicide also.
[00:33:25.482 --> 00:33:30.706]  Not because they murdered her, but because it would drag in the Jack and Robert problems.
[00:33:31.266 --> 00:33:32.547]  Moving around with Marilyn.
[00:33:33.027 --> 00:33:34.708]  Marilyn had a hair appointment the next day.
[00:33:34.768 --> 00:33:36.269]  She was involved in three projects.
[00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:43.954]  She was the least suicidal person anyone who had spoken to her has seen her in the days leading up to it.
[00:33:44.754 --> 00:33:49.657]  And the two doctors, the cops said everyone was acting really fishy when they came on the scene.
[00:33:50.297 --> 00:33:52.078]  They didn't call the police for six hours.
[00:33:52.098 --> 00:33:55.961]  You know, when they got there, they were washing her sheets and cleaning the place.
[00:33:55.981 --> 00:33:57.041]  You know, I mean, it's a murder scene.
[00:33:58.722 --> 00:34:00.323]  It was just ridiculous.
[00:34:02.804 --> 00:34:11.727]  There's no doubt she was murdered, but it backfired because the plot was to embarrass the Kennedys, but the police weren't called for six hours.
[00:34:12.207 --> 00:34:12.427]  Wow.
[00:34:12.867 --> 00:34:19.410]  Pretty damning evidence, and you've got those people in pretty high places who have a stake in getting the scene cleaned up.
[00:34:19.841 --> 00:34:33.811]  You know what's interesting about some of these crimes is that sometimes an element within the government will commit some heinous act, but then the government as an institution who wasn't in on it has to cover it up out of embarrassment.
[00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:34.451]  Yeah.
[00:34:34.711 --> 00:34:40.235]  That's like when Jack Kennedy was murdered, I mean there were people, that was not a coup d'etat.
[00:34:41.656 --> 00:34:42.577]  That was a correction.
[00:34:44.538 --> 00:34:48.259]  There were people in the government that had no knowledge of the murder, and there were people that did.
[00:34:48.299 --> 00:34:54.281]  There were elements within the government, you know, with the CIA and Cuban exiles and white citizens.
[00:34:54.441 --> 00:34:55.622]  I mean, there was a cabal.
[00:34:56.282 --> 00:35:04.324]  And we already had executive action in place, which were these shooter teams that were trained to kill heads of state, because they were trying to assassinate Castro.
[00:35:04.824 --> 00:35:12.807]  And as we say, a lot of people say in the research community, you know, they just turned the guns around, because you have people trained at killing heads of state.
[00:35:13.507 --> 00:35:17.669]  And in Dallas on that day, you or I could have killed Kennedy.
[00:35:17.969 --> 00:35:25.271]  There were windows open all over the plaza, an army division that's supposed to generally guard the president was told to stand down.
[00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:28.232]  It was like, you know, it was kind of a joke.
[00:35:28.332 --> 00:35:30.753]  There was no protection for him that day.
[00:35:33.175 --> 00:35:40.461]  A lot of times you'll see that the government covers something up that they didn't have knowledge of when it happened, which makes it even more complicated.
[00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:41.502]  You know what I mean?
[00:35:41.522 --> 00:35:43.103]  Yeah, you make a very good point there.
[00:35:43.123 --> 00:35:59.678]  You talk about the Warren Commission in your book, and you say when the Warren Commission did their supposed scenarios of the shooter in Dallas, they have their, I guess, Patsy or whoever run the steps to see, you know, so they can time it, but they make the guy slow down,
[00:36:00.078 --> 00:36:08.062]  And also the officer who was supposedly on the scene at the time who ran up the stairs and saw Oswald, was it on the second floor drinking a Coke?
[00:36:08.462 --> 00:36:22.449]  Yeah, Officer Bear, he was a veteran, an Army veteran, he was on his motorcycle, he heard gunshots, and being in the military, he knew they were from above him, either from the Dalvax building or from the depository.
[00:36:22.909 --> 00:36:25.791]  He parked his motorcycle, ran up the front stairs,
[00:36:26.511 --> 00:36:30.772]  of the depository bumped into Roy Trulli, the manager of the Book Depository.
[00:36:31.112 --> 00:36:45.935]  They got to the second floor, they saw Oswald through a glass window door thing at a Coke machine, calmly standing there with a Coke in his hand, and Roy Trulli said to Officer Berry, he's okay, he works here.
[00:36:46.255 --> 00:36:47.595]  And then they kept wrapping up.
[00:36:48.155 --> 00:36:55.837]  But it's like, you know, there's a joke that this writer wrote about, you know, when cops come on a scene, they always go, nobody move.
[00:36:56.357 --> 00:36:56.557]  Yeah.
[00:36:56.978 --> 00:36:58.779]  I mean, this cop said, everybody move.
[00:37:00.981 --> 00:37:07.086]  Essentially, because first of all, Oswald never was on the sixth floor, never fired a shot.
[00:37:07.647 --> 00:37:13.332]  He was seen having lunch on the first floor about six minutes before the assassination.
[00:37:14.052 --> 00:37:19.597]  As a matter of fact, the reason we know this is because in the little written
[00:37:20.598 --> 00:37:31.786]  Record of what Oswald said he was interviewed all the notes were destroyed But some of the notes were did survive and one of the things Oswald said Then he said I was in the lunchroom
[00:37:32.599 --> 00:37:36.762]  And he said, and he named two people that were in the lunchroom.
[00:37:36.782 --> 00:37:37.503]  Okay.
[00:37:37.803 --> 00:37:42.186]  And one of them, there were two black gentlemen that worked in the depository in a floor above Oswald's.
[00:37:43.026 --> 00:37:46.348]  Um, he named one, one's guy, one guy's name was junior.
[00:37:46.388 --> 00:37:47.329]  And I forget the other guy's name.
[00:37:47.409 --> 00:37:48.250]  Oswald didn't know it either.
[00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.451]  He said, yeah, I saw a junior.
[00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:51.052]  What's his name in there.
[00:37:51.092 --> 00:37:56.015]  Now those two gentlemen went in and said they saw Oswald in the lunchroom.
[00:37:56.275 --> 00:38:00.838]  So for him to guess out of all the employees that those were the two guys,
[00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:03.079]  Ridiculous.
[00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:12.321]  Plus, there was a woman who was pregnant, working at the depository, who had to go to the washroom like every 20 minutes or so, and pregnant women will know.
[00:38:12.341 --> 00:38:14.381]  You know, women do that a lot.
[00:38:14.841 --> 00:38:21.702]  And so she knew time, and she was going through the lunchroom about 12.23, and she remembers seeing all of them.
[00:38:22.162 --> 00:38:29.724]  So that means he would have to have run up those five flights, fire off those three shots with that, you know, half-assed rifle.
[00:38:31.184 --> 00:38:31.344]  Yeah.
[00:38:47.794 --> 00:39:05.508]  And, you know, when you see books written about this that say Oswald did, they show the diagram, like Posner and these other people, of the Book Depository, sixth floor, and the window where Oswald supposedly fired from, and the door that he had to go through on the other side of the floor to go downstairs, in a straight line.
[00:39:05.849 --> 00:39:08.331]  But in reality, there were stacks of books
[00:39:09.011 --> 00:39:09.972]  All over that floor.
[00:39:10.032 --> 00:39:18.000]  So he had, whoever the shooter was, it wasn't Oswald, but if it was Oswald, he had to fire the three shots, you know, recite each time.
[00:39:20.202 --> 00:39:23.966]  The best marksman on Earth tried to do that and he couldn't do it.
[00:39:23.986 --> 00:39:30.373]  Yeah, there's also an episode of Conspiracy Theory where Jesse Ventura did the, recreated the same shot.
[00:39:30.773 --> 00:39:31.754]  And he's a cracked shot.
[00:39:31.814 --> 00:39:32.314]  He couldn't do it.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.061]  But also the best marksman in the world trying.
[00:39:35.421 --> 00:39:43.405]  But the thing is, when you fire a gun like that, you have to drop it a little bit to work the bolt and then re-sight.
[00:39:43.745 --> 00:39:44.945]  Of course, bolt action rifle.
[00:39:45.465 --> 00:39:48.987]  Yeah, and then, by the way, the scope was misaligned.
[00:39:49.327 --> 00:39:51.488]  Plus there was a tree in the way, literally.
[00:39:51.968 --> 00:39:53.249]  Yeah, that's a tough shot.
[00:39:54.218 --> 00:39:56.520]  It's the last place in the world a shooter would be.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.563]  It would be the other shot when he was coming down the other street towards the depository.
[00:40:02.003 --> 00:40:10.008]  At any rate, so if Oswald did say he does that, he fires the three shots and the three shells miraculously land right next to each other on the floor.
[00:40:10.668 --> 00:40:15.371]  And then he's supposed to go across the floor and wedge the rifle behind the boxes, then go down.
[00:40:16.052 --> 00:40:19.094]  The door to the stairway, by the way, is really heavy.
[00:40:19.754 --> 00:40:23.476]  So, you know, I'm saying that because everything we're talking about seconds here.
[00:40:23.936 --> 00:40:29.338]  The Warrant Commission said that Oswald did it and then he got to the second floor in 90 to 95 seconds.
[00:40:30.519 --> 00:40:40.223]  According to Officer Berry and the recreation, the FBI agent who was supposed to be Oswald, when he went in a straight line, he didn't dodge books.
[00:40:40.583 --> 00:40:43.584]  That's very important, Richard, if you could definitely hit that one home.
[00:40:43.904 --> 00:40:48.366]  That he did not run in a straight line, because as you point out, there are stacks of books.
[00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:50.967]  It's a field, I guess you'd call it a field library.
[00:40:51.367 --> 00:40:53.048]  So he can't run in a straight line.
[00:40:53.088 --> 00:40:54.208]  He's dodging bookshelves.
[00:40:54.828 --> 00:40:55.809]  Like an obstacle course.
[00:40:56.189 --> 00:40:59.990]  So even if he was running, he didn't have to stop and go around.
[00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:07.373]  But the FBI agent just went across the floor, didn't wedge the rifle behind boxes the way they say it was found.
[00:41:07.393 --> 00:41:08.874]  He laid it on the ground.
[00:41:09.654 --> 00:41:11.275]  Anyone down to the second floor.
[00:41:11.755 --> 00:41:31.488]  And that's key, because to wedge it behind boxes is a few seconds, to dodge the books is a few seconds, to pull that door is a few seconds, to go down eight short flights, not four, to cross the second floor, to put a coin in a machine, to open a drink and not be out of breath, and sipping it calmly
[00:41:32.409 --> 00:41:32.909]  I mean, you know.
[00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:45.738]  So, what I figured, what I believe is, if it was someone on the 6th floor getting into the 6th floor, it would have been a minute, 60 seconds, which is physically impossible.
[00:41:46.098 --> 00:41:48.180]  So he didn't fire a shot.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:42:01.989]  And, of course, you know the story that the Undertaker was at the morgue and two FBI agents came in and rolled some ink on Oswald's hand and pressed it on the rifle and left.
[00:42:02.529 --> 00:42:05.870]  Because they found no prints on the rifle at the scene.
[00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.471]  There were three rifles found in the book depository that day.
[00:42:09.871 --> 00:42:13.751]  A Mannlicher Carcano, a German Mauser, and a British Enfield rifle.
[00:42:14.752 --> 00:42:20.913]  And there's good evidence to the first people to identify the weapon called it a Mauser.
[00:42:21.273 --> 00:42:24.314]  And the gentleman who identified it was a gun dealer.
[00:42:24.654 --> 00:42:26.394]  So, you know, they say, oh, he made a mistake.
[00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:27.174]  No, no, no.
[00:42:27.474 --> 00:42:29.435]  That's a pretty accurate description.
[00:42:29.995 --> 00:42:33.317]  Yeah, his name was Weisberg, I think, not Weisberg, something like that.
[00:42:33.337 --> 00:42:37.439]  Anyway, he was a gun shop owner, and he said, yeah, it was a Mauser, you know.
[00:42:37.879 --> 00:42:46.504]  And then we saw, there's pictures of them carrying out an infield, a British infield rifle, which was found on the roof, and shells were found on the roof.
[00:42:47.244 --> 00:42:56.829]  But also, what a lot of people don't talk about, is the shot that killed Kennedy, well, the shot, the big head shot, he was hit twice.
[00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:58.150]  I think?
[00:43:13.636 --> 00:43:17.358]  Dozens of pieces of like, little star-like metal.
[00:43:17.919 --> 00:43:19.960]  Because that bullet, when it hit his head, it exploded.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.901]  The bullet hit him in the back and didn't go through.
[00:43:23.482 --> 00:43:26.443]  And the bullet hit him in the throat, with the size of a pencil.
[00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:28.685]  One of the bullets was found intact.
[00:43:28.745 --> 00:43:32.267]  So, he was hit by different types of rounds, even.
[00:43:32.447 --> 00:43:33.267]  Different angles, yeah.
[00:43:33.748 --> 00:43:35.409]  Yeah, so there were, you know, there was at least
[00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.749]  I think?
[00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:00.964]  None of those people, by the way, were caught by the foreign press.
[00:44:01.384 --> 00:44:02.645]  Of course not.
[00:44:02.685 --> 00:44:06.807]  So, I mean, you know, it's just astounding.
[00:44:07.347 --> 00:44:14.431]  The information is still coming out, but there's no question that Kennedy was murdered by a conspiracy.
[00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:17.292]  And people say to me, who killed Kennedy?
[00:44:17.372 --> 00:44:18.273]  I say, who didn't kill him?
[00:44:19.653 --> 00:44:20.674]  That's about what you got.
[00:44:20.994 --> 00:44:22.835]  And I like how in your book early on,
[00:44:23.488 --> 00:44:30.491]  I'm just now starting it myself, but early on you talk about the term conspiracy, and people think it's some nutty, kooky term.
[00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:34.092]  It just basically means a group of people acting in concert.
[00:44:34.513 --> 00:44:37.874]  Two or more people acting in concert to achieve said goal.
[00:44:38.554 --> 00:44:39.214]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:39.254 --> 00:44:41.515]  I mean, millions of conspiracies happen every day.
[00:44:42.116 --> 00:44:43.996]  The American Revolution was a conspiracy.
[00:44:44.036 --> 00:44:45.297]  Watergator and Contra.
[00:44:45.857 --> 00:44:47.678]  Medical experiments at Tuskegee.
[00:44:47.698 --> 00:44:50.199]  You know, guns for hostages.
[00:44:50.259 --> 00:44:52.780]  I mean, there's conspiracies going on all the time.
[00:44:53.959 --> 00:45:12.826]  It's just that the word has been demonized and marginalized because the government has a vested interest in making people who go really deep and find the truth, they try to, you know, make them into crazy or clowns or, you know, they try to conflate it with, oh yeah, Elvis is alive and Martians are here.
[00:45:12.846 --> 00:45:14.947]  You know, I've been through it all.
[00:45:15.007 --> 00:45:21.629]  I've written several books, so that's why I'm really proud of Dead Wrong because no one has been able to refute anything in it.
[00:45:22.284 --> 00:45:23.045]  That's good, that's good.
[00:45:23.525 --> 00:45:41.119]  And early in the book, I was reading through the introduction and one of the things you first start with is the issue of Dr. Martin Luther King and how in 1999 new evidence came out concerning his assassination which never made it into the quote mainstream media.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:48.065]  So can you tell us first what that information was that was discovered in 1999 and also why you think it was covered up?
[00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:49.951]  Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:45:50.671 --> 00:45:51.772]  Anybody can look this up.
[00:45:52.112 --> 00:46:05.318]  A jury, okay, a civil jury in Tennessee in 1999 found that the government, the United States government, was involved in the conspiracy to murder Dr. King.
[00:46:05.918 --> 00:46:10.541]  Now, not many people know that, but that was a jury finding in Tennessee.
[00:46:11.421 --> 00:46:20.566]  And clearly, you know, the corporate press may have, you know, and obviously it's in the public domain because it was a trial, so we could find the information.
[00:46:20.586 --> 00:46:21.866]  Easily, yeah.
[00:46:21.906 --> 00:46:25.008]  Yeah, the press really wasn't, you know, here's what happens.
[00:46:25.428 --> 00:46:32.912]  The press will, like that for instance, if they, you know, reported that in a big way, everyone's going to say, well, where were you?
[00:46:33.632 --> 00:46:43.180]  You know, the press has dropped the ball on Jack Kennedy's murder, Bobby Kennedy's murder, Malcolm's murder, for Hampton's murder, Medgar's murder.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:47.304]  I mean, they just don't because they missed the initial story.
[00:46:47.824 --> 00:46:50.527]  Then they have, you know, then they gather the wagons.
[00:46:50.627 --> 00:46:56.272]  And, you know, there are reporters to this day who know that there was a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy.
[00:46:57.292 --> 00:47:09.498]  But at the time, they thought they were good patriots and didn't want the rest of the world to think we were a banana republic, so they stuck to the party line that it was a lone assassin who wanted to be a communist and stuck with it.
[00:47:09.618 --> 00:47:13.540]  And now they have to stick with it because they're embarrassed or worse.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.481]  Complicitous.
[00:47:16.602 --> 00:47:20.824]  But as far as Dr. King, what was the new information that you found?
[00:47:21.363 --> 00:47:25.006]  Yeah, well, first of all, James Earl Ray was innocent.
[00:47:25.346 --> 00:47:27.248]  Dr. King's family believed him.
[00:47:27.668 --> 00:47:31.151]  He pleaded guilty so he wouldn't get the death penalty.
[00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:36.355]  The bathroom that he allegedly fired the shot from, there's a bathtub next to the window.
[00:47:36.976 --> 00:47:39.538]  So you have had to have straddled that tub.
[00:47:40.038 --> 00:47:42.240]  Plus, the weapon that they retrieved
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:55.952]  Did not match the round that killed Dr. King, plus the famous picture on the balcony of the people pointing up to where the shot came from, where James Earl Ray was.
[00:47:55.972 --> 00:47:59.495]  It was a direct straight line across from the terrace where Dr. King was.
[00:47:59.895 --> 00:48:01.757]  The shot came from above right.
[00:48:02.097 --> 00:48:06.961]  So, you know, immediately on the scene, then they pointed to where the shooter was, where Earl Ray wasn't.
[00:48:07.902 --> 00:48:11.845]  He offered thousands of dollars in airplane tickets.
[00:48:11.905 --> 00:48:14.027]  He was a patsy like Oswald.
[00:48:16.269 --> 00:48:17.850]  Dr. King's family believes he's innocent.
[00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.494]  And then a jury 14 years ago finds there was government involvement.
[00:48:22.794 --> 00:48:29.400]  And we do know that there was an elite army unit in town that day.
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:34.224]  Plus, Dr. King was being tailed everywhere he went.
[00:48:34.989 --> 00:48:40.013]  So, you know, if there was a plot or if there was something else, the government would have known and could have stopped it.
[00:48:40.434 --> 00:48:44.537]  So, you know, that's why they clearly were involved because they knew everything he was doing.
[00:48:44.557 --> 00:48:57.748]  As a matter of fact, Hoover made these fake tapes of Dr. King, the orgies and stuff, which were all doctored and not true, sent to Dr. King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, and said, you should commit suicide.
[00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:59.530]  We'll release this.
[00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.452]  I mean, they did everything they could.
[00:49:01.952 --> 00:49:10.437]  And then when Dr. King won the Nobel Prize because, you know, he came out against the Vietnam War, why should poor American kids go and die across the world?
[00:49:10.817 --> 00:49:14.740]  You know, he was, that's when I think they said, okay, this guy's got to go.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:22.324]  It's enough that he's, you know, doing the civil rights stuff, but now he's doing, he's winning Nobel Prizes and, you know, he's talking about it against the war.
[00:49:22.424 --> 00:49:25.026]  I just think they said, that's it.
[00:49:25.586 --> 00:49:25.847]  You know.
[00:49:26.348 --> 00:49:26.809]  Exactly.
[00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.258]  Now you touched on the lone gunman a little bit.
[00:49:30.318 --> 00:49:32.924]  Why do you think they love that scenario of a lone gunman so much?
[00:49:33.447 --> 00:49:50.240]  It's funny, my friend Gaurav Dahu, rest in peace, he would say that, have you ever noticed that all these diaries that they find, like Oswald and Richard Gremer, the guy that shot George Wallace, they're all kind of written by the same guy at the CIA, who's a frustrated novelist.
[00:49:50.841 --> 00:49:56.185]  It's always easy to, you know, the lone gunman is, and now it's a cliche and a joke,
[00:49:57.646 --> 00:50:00.729]  It's just an easy way to say, you know, this little nut did it.
[00:50:01.089 --> 00:50:08.976]  And then you marginalize people and say, well, this is a little bit more complicated than some fake defector, you know, who couldn't shoot the side of a barn.
[00:50:08.996 --> 00:50:13.140]  You know, Oswald, in the late 50s, there were about 18 or 19
[00:50:15.041 --> 00:50:23.985]  Marines and soldiers that were recruited to become fake defectors and pretend they were defecting from America and go to Russia to spy.
[00:50:24.365 --> 00:50:26.526]  The Russians knew every single one of them.
[00:50:28.026 --> 00:50:29.587]  They knew Oswald was what he was.
[00:50:30.287 --> 00:50:31.288]  He had a great apartment.
[00:50:31.308 --> 00:50:33.489]  He worked in a radio factory in Minsk.
[00:50:33.529 --> 00:50:34.449]  They kept an eye on him.
[00:50:34.909 --> 00:50:38.391]  He miraculously marries the daughter of a KGB colonel.
[00:50:39.151 --> 00:50:46.697]  And gets back in the country very easily, after saying he's going to give up secrets, and you know, the whole thing is very fishy.
[00:50:46.997 --> 00:50:48.258]  But he was a fake defector.
[00:50:48.759 --> 00:51:06.132]  And there were two Oswalds, we know that now, because when he was arrested in the movie theater, as you recall, several people saw a man run out of the back of the theater as Oswald was being arrested, that looked pretty, a lot like Oswald.
[00:51:07.634 --> 00:51:09.075]  That's probably the real shooter.
[00:51:09.095 --> 00:51:10.615]  And Oswald was the patsy.
[00:51:12.136 --> 00:51:21.241]  But, you know, just aside from that, you know, there's so many elements to the case, you know, people get, you know, confused or it's complicated.
[00:51:21.401 --> 00:51:23.782]  The reality is Oswald didn't fire a shot.
[00:51:24.102 --> 00:51:25.263]  Let's start from there.
[00:51:26.023 --> 00:51:27.784]  You know, it's like, and that's provable.
[00:51:28.484 --> 00:51:32.306]  And the President was hit by different types of bullets.
[00:51:32.826 --> 00:51:33.527]  That's provable.
[00:51:33.647 --> 00:51:36.148]  So, I mean, there are basic irrefutable things.
[00:51:36.708 --> 00:51:37.670]  Thank you for having me.
[00:51:52.648 --> 00:51:58.432]  You could take this device and, like, erase things and change on the film.
[00:51:58.932 --> 00:52:05.496]  There's another film that was shot by a gentleman named Orville Nix from the other side of the street.
[00:52:05.996 --> 00:52:10.779]  And if you match up the two films side by side, they don't match in time.
[00:52:10.799 --> 00:52:19.064]  It's because the Pruder film was doctored to meet... Meet their circumstances.
[00:52:19.644 --> 00:52:20.605]  The car stopped.
[00:52:22.365 --> 00:52:32.393]  In any version of the Suprema film that we see, it slows down, but everyone said the car stopped, the driver looked around until Kenny's head was exploded, and then he took off.
[00:52:32.953 --> 00:52:34.595]  So, come on.
[00:52:35.956 --> 00:52:37.237]  Make sure he's dead back there, yeah.
[00:52:37.817 --> 00:52:46.304]  Read the manual of the CIA, excuse me, the Secret Service protector, the manual, and if you hear a gunshot, even if it's three blocks away, you floor it.
[00:52:48.611 --> 00:52:50.954]  Even if the tires are shot out, you floor it.
[00:52:51.294 --> 00:52:54.277]  Here's the guy, here's a gunshot, and puts on the brakes.
[00:52:55.237 --> 00:52:55.518]  Yeah.
[00:52:56.038 --> 00:52:57.440]  With the President in the car.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.682]  Yeah, if nothing else, he'd be concerned for himself.
[00:53:00.382 --> 00:53:01.944]  You know, and he's gonna stop and look around.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.602]  Exactly, but he, you know, he knew what was... There was a lot of foreknowledge.
[00:53:06.662 --> 00:53:11.265]  You know, some people have written books and saying Johnson ordered the murder.
[00:53:11.585 --> 00:53:12.246]  I don't believe that.
[00:53:12.266 --> 00:53:14.587]  I believe Johnson was told it was going to happen.
[00:53:15.527 --> 00:53:18.029]  I don't think he ordered it, per se.
[00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.769]  Okay.
[00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:20.490]  Now, if we could switch gears a little bit.
[00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:25.693]  I saw an interview you did with Mr. Gilbert Godfrey, of all people.
[00:53:25.793 --> 00:53:27.734]  Was it on the Intelligence Channel?
[00:53:27.774 --> 00:53:28.375]  Is that correct, sir?
[00:53:29.284 --> 00:53:30.847]  Uh, Intelligent Television, yeah.
[00:53:30.867 --> 00:53:32.469]  Intelligent Television, on YouTube, yes.
[00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:37.116]  And the reason why I brought this up, I was watching this earlier when I was prepping for this interview.
[00:53:37.576 --> 00:53:44.607]  There's a part in there where you ask Gilbert about a joke he did on 9-11 shortly thereafter, I believe it was at a Hugh Hefner roast.
[00:53:45.047 --> 00:53:45.268]  Yes.
[00:53:45.988 --> 00:53:54.278]  And you guys bring up the point of how, you know, even though he was off color at the time, I think it was a week after 9-11 or so, he goes out there and does his 9-11 jokes.
[00:53:54.619 --> 00:54:03.089]  But you guys bring up a good point that just because, you know, whatever happened on 9-11, you can't just give up your life and, you know, sit in a box and curl up and cry.
[00:54:03.409 --> 00:54:04.891]  I mean, you have to go on enjoying life.
[00:54:05.992 --> 00:54:21.688]  There was nothing more American to me than turning this horrific event into something that we can all have a cathartic laugh about, to show the terrorists that, yeah, you may have killed us, but here we are celebrating.
[00:54:21.988 --> 00:54:22.769]  We're Americans.
[00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:24.370]  You're not going to win.
[00:54:28.774 --> 00:54:36.682]  Uh, I forget what the joke was, but, you know, that, you know, he had a stopover, you know, he had a flight and there was a stopover at the Empire State Building.
[00:54:36.702 --> 00:54:41.927]  You know, just some joke that was, you know, too soon, and there was a gasp.
[00:54:41.987 --> 00:54:48.933]  But then he went into, he did this famous joke, The Aristocrats, which is, you know, one of the dirtiest, funniest jokes.
[00:54:48.953 --> 00:54:49.914]  It's a legendary joke.
[00:54:49.954 --> 00:54:51.495]  Yeah, there's nothing we can say on there.
[00:54:52.585 --> 00:55:03.233]  You don't need to, but the point is, it was the most scatological, you know, it's a funny, disgusting, long joke that everyone was on the floor laughing about, you know.
[00:55:03.654 --> 00:55:10.279]  And so it's okay to talk about incest and excrement and all those terrible things, but don't make a joke about 9-11.
[00:55:10.799 --> 00:55:12.681]  It's like, wait a minute, what are our priorities?
[00:55:12.701 --> 00:55:20.707]  You know, it's like, our role is to whistle past the graveyard and keep our chin up and not let them crush our spirit.
[00:55:21.414 --> 00:55:21.614]  Yeah.
[00:55:22.235 --> 00:55:24.276]  Alright, our guest is Mr. Richard Belzer.
[00:55:24.996 --> 00:55:26.717]  Richard, are you working on anything new?
[00:55:26.777 --> 00:55:28.118]  Can we look forward to any new works?
[00:55:28.819 --> 00:55:42.427]  Yes, well, I'm working on another book called Hit List, about all the people that were murdered or committed suicide that were witnesses or had information about the JFK assassination.
[00:55:44.296 --> 00:55:45.457]  That'll come out in the spring.
[00:55:45.917 --> 00:55:48.259]  And then I'm working on another book, Dead Wrong 2.
[00:55:48.439 --> 00:56:01.408]  Then I'm working on still another book, which would be an anthology of all the best scholarship and writing about the murder, the Janet Kaye assassination.
[00:56:01.428 --> 00:56:04.411]  That will be timed for the 50th anniversary of the assassination.
[00:56:05.757 --> 00:56:11.099]  And of course I'm on Law & Order SVU, and my talk show that you mentioned is on YouTube, Richard Belzer's Conversation.
[00:56:11.719 --> 00:56:12.219]  Okay.
[00:56:12.819 --> 00:56:18.861]  And iced tea, and Dick Cavett, and you know, a lot of interesting people.
[00:56:19.362 --> 00:56:24.743]  Okay, now we've had a lot of questions since you've been on our show about the Funny or Die skit with Christopher Walken.
[00:56:24.763 --> 00:56:25.904]  Has it aired yet?
[00:56:26.924 --> 00:56:34.947]  If it has, I haven't seen it, but a lot of people are asking questions, so can you tell us a little bit about that situation, or what's going on with that?
[00:56:37.888 --> 00:56:43.933]  Funny or Die wanted to do something with Chris because he's virally Chris Spalking.
[00:56:44.433 --> 00:56:47.856]  He's like a big presence on the net.
[00:56:48.016 --> 00:56:48.737]  People love him.
[00:56:48.757 --> 00:56:50.559]  He's funny, he's interesting, he's cool.
[00:56:51.179 --> 00:56:52.740]  And they wanted him to do this cooking thing.
[00:56:53.621 --> 00:57:09.010]  You know, because he cooks and they wanted him to pair him with another celebrity where they go and shop, you know, and talk, you know, interview each other and go shopping, then go to his house and cook and then eat and the whole time just, you know, rapping and talking.
[00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:15.413]  And they gave him a list of celebrities and, you know, Angelina Jolie and all these people.
[00:57:16.094 --> 00:57:17.214]  My name wasn't on the list.
[00:57:17.274 --> 00:57:21.357]  And Chris said, well, you know, my friend Richard Belzer, he lives in
[00:57:22.583 --> 00:57:23.043]  Friends.
[00:57:24.244 --> 00:57:25.504]  You know, he's a gourmet.
[00:57:25.524 --> 00:57:26.825]  I want to do it with him.
[00:57:27.325 --> 00:57:27.525]  Yeah.
[00:57:28.046 --> 00:57:29.726]  So we did it together.
[00:57:29.766 --> 00:57:34.889]  We went shopping and we cooked and we ate the meal.
[00:57:34.929 --> 00:57:35.769]  But it was hysterical.
[00:57:35.949 --> 00:57:37.790]  These two beautiful girls that were helping us.
[00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:41.772]  And I mean, Chris and I have known each other for, I don't know, 30 or whatever.
[00:57:42.232 --> 00:57:42.332]  Wow.
[00:57:43.593 --> 00:57:47.196]  We just go way back and we're very comfortable with each other.
[00:57:47.236 --> 00:57:51.980]  So it was almost like the cameras were eavesdropping because we weren't really performing.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.981]  We were just talking and telling stories.
[00:57:54.061 --> 00:58:00.326]  I mean, I interviewed him and asked him about films and plays and acting and food and movies.
[00:58:00.787 --> 00:58:04.710]  But it was just he and I reminiscing about the old days when we were younger and stuff.
[00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:07.872]  So it was quite funny and cool, you know.
[00:58:08.973 --> 00:58:11.314]  I'm anxious to see how they cut it together.
[00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:12.675]  Hopefully it'll be out soon.
[00:58:13.415 --> 00:58:13.835]  All right.
[00:58:14.796 --> 00:58:16.477]  Chris Walken.
[00:58:16.537 --> 00:58:20.279]  Everybody, we've had the cowbell jokes good and plenty.
[00:58:20.819 --> 00:58:36.407]  It's so funny, I remember I was watching that back when I was at home before I moved down here to Austin for the job and I was wishing, I was like, man, I wish I could be there so I could do the, you know, the voice for the, to the night, you know, tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News and I could do some cowbell joke.
[00:58:36.927 --> 00:58:41.349]  Christopher Walken has a fever, and the only cure is more Info Wars.
[00:58:41.429 --> 00:58:42.529]  You know, something like that.
[00:58:43.049 --> 00:58:48.832]  But our guest is Mr. Richard Belzer, and they can get a hold of you on iBells.com, correct?
[00:58:49.312 --> 00:58:49.572]  Yes.
[00:58:50.172 --> 00:58:53.533]  BelzerBook.com is all about my book.
[00:58:54.154 --> 00:58:54.994]  It's a great website.
[00:58:55.014 --> 00:58:56.534]  There's a lot of footage on there and stuff.
[00:58:57.235 --> 00:59:02.737]  And my website is iBells.com, and my Twitter is Mr. Belzer.
[00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:03.870]  OK.
[00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:13.878]  The book is available through Alex's outlet, but it's also on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and I really appreciate you guys having me on.
[00:59:14.418 --> 00:59:18.301]  Oh, no, we'll definitely try to get you back on the radio show so you can take calls.
[00:59:18.561 --> 00:59:19.742]  That's one thing you mentioned today.
[00:59:19.782 --> 00:59:22.244]  So we'll definitely try to get you hooked back up with Alex.
[00:59:22.304 --> 00:59:23.905]  And you guys can go at it again.
[00:59:23.985 --> 00:59:25.506]  And I see you got your guest back there.
[00:59:25.526 --> 00:59:26.227]  I see Cartman.
[00:59:26.287 --> 00:59:28.629]  And I can't say who that is over your shoulder.
[00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.909]  Jack Kennedy.
[00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.830]  Oh, OK.
[00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.551]  All right.
[00:59:32.444 --> 00:59:33.825]  Yeah, I can see him now.
[00:59:33.905 --> 00:59:34.466]  I can see him now.
[00:59:35.147 --> 00:59:36.668]  Yeah, I'm not too obsessed.
[00:59:37.048 --> 00:59:44.195]  Alright, Mr. Richard Belz, it is a pleasure meeting you, sir, and hopefully you'll be back on the radio show again soon.
[00:59:44.695 --> 00:59:47.498]  And please tell Alex I told him to rest and feel better.
[00:59:48.007 --> 00:59:48.768]  Okay, thank you, Richard.
[00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.769]  Take care, buddy.
[00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:52.352]  All right, there's our guest, Mr. Richard Belzer.
[00:59:52.673 --> 00:59:55.456]  The book is Dead Wrong, available at the InfoWars shop.
[00:59:55.797 --> 00:59:56.417]  It's a great read.
[00:59:56.437 --> 01:00:03.926]  Like I said, I just started reading it myself, but thus far, even the introduction gave me something I had never known before, so definitely appreciate him and his time.
[01:00:04.227 --> 01:00:05.588]  And while you're at the InfoWars shop...
[01:00:06.229 --> 01:00:07.590]  The new InfoWars magazine.
[01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:08.470]  It's a great read.
[01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:10.211]  We got subscriptions coming out.
[01:00:10.531 --> 01:00:12.152]  You can get them individually.
[01:00:12.172 --> 01:00:14.173]  You can get the PDFs, I believe.
[01:00:14.533 --> 01:00:15.394]  A lot of great stuff.
[01:00:15.674 --> 01:00:16.915]  And support this broadcast.
[01:00:16.975 --> 01:00:23.058]  If you want to see more guests like Richard Belzer, Jesse Ventura, whoever else, support us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:24.198]  Get yourself a subscription.
[01:00:24.558 --> 01:00:25.599]  About $6 a month.
[01:00:25.639 --> 01:00:31.022]  You waste $6 a month on Starbucks coffee and a lot of other GMO and other crap.
[01:00:31.302 --> 01:00:33.043]  But it's something good, something tangible.
[01:00:33.823 --> 01:00:38.564]  The Nightly News, the radio show, Alex's freak-outs and rants.
[01:00:38.624 --> 01:00:41.325]  It's a lot of good stuff on there, so be sure to check that out.
[01:00:41.685 --> 01:00:48.126]  So we'll be back right after this break with Mr. Aaron Dykes and his special report on the GMO at Whole Foods.
[01:00:48.466 --> 01:00:48.966]  Stay tuned.
[01:00:53.707 --> 01:00:58.608]  Hello, this is Linda West with a special report for InfoWars.com.
[01:00:59.545 --> 01:01:04.767]  A new DVD has come out by GMO expert and scholar Jeffrey Smith.
[01:01:05.488 --> 01:01:07.168]  It's entitled Genetic Roulette.
[01:01:08.489 --> 01:01:22.095]  It exposes the shockingly unbelievable connection between the proliferation of GMOs by huge agri-corporations and the huge increase in disease in America.
[01:01:22.415 --> 01:01:24.296]  Things we're seeing today aren't normal.
[01:01:26.007 --> 01:01:28.469]  We didn't say I'm 30 years ago or 50 years ago.
[01:01:28.489 --> 01:01:31.411]  Illnesses that weren't epidemic before are now epidemic.
[01:01:31.912 --> 01:01:46.703]  With this new comprehensive information, we can finally solve the mystery between the rising disease, cancer, allergies, Alzheimer's, premature aging, and even autism.
[01:01:51.113 --> 01:02:02.545]  I'm concerned about all the health issues that I'm seeing, but the one that I am most alarmed about is autistic spectrum, which is literally skyrocketed.
[01:02:03.065 --> 01:02:09.432]  We can't say for sure that GMOs have anything to do with autism, but we can say for sure that it doesn't.
[01:02:10.239 --> 01:02:23.763]  In fact, there's been an increase in autism since GMOs were introduced, and animals that eat GMOs, both in laboratory and in livestock situations, have shown some tell-tale signs that some practitioners say are linked with autism.
[01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:36.926]  Jeffrey Smith has done the scientific research that finally reveals the truth about GMOs that Big Agricorps and the government has tried so hard to cover up.
[01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:39.607]  This food conspiracy
[01:02:40.566 --> 01:02:44.024]  Is making them billionaires and us sick.
[01:02:44.574 --> 01:02:49.498]  He said he lost about 90% of his miniature steers.
[01:02:50.039 --> 01:02:57.565]  What the problem was is I guess he said that they weren't able to process the food correctly and they would bloat up and die from it.
[01:02:57.845 --> 01:03:00.847]  Now that we have the real information, we can make changes.
[01:03:01.208 --> 01:03:09.354]  Now we know exactly why diseases are on the rise, surgeries are on the rise, and so many small minds are being stolen from autism.
[01:03:09.574 --> 01:03:12.597]  I know today we all have a lot on our plate.
[01:03:13.817 --> 01:03:17.103]  But what's on our plate today is killing us.
[01:03:18.145 --> 01:03:22.613]  This is Linda West wishing your family a happy
[01:03:23.436 --> 01:03:24.977]  And healthy future.
[01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:55.136]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:03:55.316 --> 01:03:56.637]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:03:56.757 --> 01:03:59.637]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:03.118]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:04:03.338 --> 01:04:07.359]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:04:07.519 --> 01:04:10.119]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:04:10.259 --> 01:04:11.579]  It's what my family uses.
[01:04:11.859 --> 01:04:15.080]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:20.501]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[01:04:21.061 --> 01:04:22.307]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:04:32.645 --> 01:04:38.229]  Christy Hightower here with PlanetInfoWars.com to give you a quick update on what's going on on the site.
[01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:40.531]  Now, Alex says it all the time.
[01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:41.992]  You are the resistance.
[01:04:42.192 --> 01:04:46.415]  And if you're watching this broadcast right now, you're already making the effort to educate yourself.
[01:04:46.915 --> 01:04:49.957]  Now, I'm asking you to make the effort to get involved.
[01:04:50.497 --> 01:04:55.041]  And what better place and what better time than now to join PlanetInfoWars.com.
[01:04:55.521 --> 01:04:56.562]  Now, I want to put this out there.
[01:04:56.602 --> 01:05:00.905]  You don't have to be a member to see some of the articles and the missions that I'm going to mention.
[01:05:01.798 --> 01:05:06.482]  But, obviously, you can get involved, and you can see comments, and you can be more active if you're a member.
[01:05:06.962 --> 01:05:08.563]  So, PlanetAndFours.com.
[01:05:08.583 --> 01:05:13.447]  But, on that note, I wanted to move into this article written by PlanetAndFours user Exilus.
[01:05:14.047 --> 01:05:18.311]  And it really struck a chord with me, because, here, let me read that first line to you.
[01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:30.940]  It says, You've severed ties with friends whose time is no longer worth your own because they have made it clear they are too attached with the false reality they've grown up with and fed on a daily basis.
[01:05:31.881 --> 01:05:33.101]  Now, you can go finish this.
[01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:36.742]  It's titled, Woes of the Awakened, and it's in the Offbeat category.
[01:05:36.842 --> 01:05:39.503]  So, Offbeat category, Woes of the Awakened.
[01:05:39.543 --> 01:05:40.043]  Check it out.
[01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:43.584]  I really appreciate your heartfelt post, Exilus.
[01:05:43.824 --> 01:05:44.464]  I appreciate it.
[01:05:44.604 --> 01:05:46.764]  Alright, so, moving on.
[01:05:46.804 --> 01:05:50.365]  There's actually another article I came across, and it was posted by Now.
[01:05:50.425 --> 01:05:51.486]  The user is Now.
[01:05:52.006 --> 01:05:57.387]  And it says, Critics say you libertarians are soulless materialists.
[01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:04.153]  I don't know what you guys think about this, so go and put your comments below at the bottom of the article.
[01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.596]  If you sign in, you can post your comment.
[01:06:06.656 --> 01:06:09.259]  I'm really curious to see what you guys have to say about this.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:17.567]  And then lastly, there's this awesome mission, and it's by The Resistance Group, one of many awesome active groups.
[01:06:18.048 --> 01:06:18.989]  And the mission is simple.
[01:06:19.369 --> 01:06:26.296]  It asks you to list what are the top five subjects you feel people should be talking about.
[01:06:26.757 --> 01:06:28.539]  So there's anything people have already posted.
[01:06:29.139 --> 01:06:38.910]  There's anything from Monsanto and GMOs, which we've seen a lot about lately, to the Federal Reserve, war crimes, economic collapse, preparedness.
[01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:41.191]  You name it, it's on the site.
[01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:46.133]  So it's great that people are already saying that this is what they want to see more of.
[01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:48.674]  So you think you can change the world?
[01:06:50.254 --> 01:06:54.556]  Well, those of you that can, and those of you that cannot, are both usually right.
[01:06:55.356 --> 01:07:13.736]  So, lastly, I wanted to say that if you haven't signed up for your free e-subscription for the InfoWars magazine, this is the October edition, number two, go to InfoWarsShop.com to buy it in bulk or you can go to InfoWars.com slash newsletter and sign up for it there.
[01:07:13.776 --> 01:07:15.417]  We'll be sending out the digital copy
[01:07:16.058 --> 01:07:17.059]  Hopefully in the next few days.
[01:07:17.179 --> 01:07:19.180]  So go ahead and sign up ASAP.
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.482]  And then also, don't forget to follow us, Planet Infowars.
[01:07:22.522 --> 01:07:23.203]  We tweet out.
[01:07:23.283 --> 01:07:25.364]  We have an at real P-I-W.
[01:07:25.444 --> 01:07:27.125]  It's at real P-I-W.
[01:07:28.326 --> 01:07:29.407]  So you can find any of our tweets.
[01:07:29.427 --> 01:07:31.028]  You can also do a hashtag P-I-W.
[01:07:31.068 --> 01:07:31.888]  You can find us that way.
[01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:36.171]  And we're also on Facebook, slash realplanetinfowars.
[01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:38.832]  Or you can find us through Alex Jones' Facebook.
[01:07:38.892 --> 01:07:40.653]  So we're just trying to keep you updated.
[01:07:40.693 --> 01:07:41.693]  We ask you questions.
[01:07:41.733 --> 01:07:43.094]  We want to see what you've got going on.
[01:07:43.134 --> 01:07:45.995]  We like to tweet out cool missions that we find on the site.
[01:07:46.035 --> 01:07:47.195]  We like to send out articles.
[01:07:47.576 --> 01:07:56.559]  So if you kind of get intimidated, the website Planet Enforce can be a little messy because there's so many cool articles and there's so many cool groups and missions.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.761]  So we try to narrow it down a little bit for you there.
[01:08:00.361 --> 01:08:02.062]  And thank you, Patriots.
[01:08:02.242 --> 01:08:04.002]  You all are talking and we're listening.
[01:08:04.262 --> 01:08:05.083]  So until next time.
[01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:13.169]  And welcome back.
[01:08:13.649 --> 01:08:22.593]  GMOs at Whole Foods have become a hot topic of debate as of late, and I actually have this very short piece I'd like to read from the official Whole Food Market blog.
[01:08:23.033 --> 01:08:28.855]  It reads, some products in our store do contain GMOs, just like any food store in the country.
[01:08:29.195 --> 01:08:33.817]  And for the relevance of such a topic, we will turn now to Mr. Aaron Dice.
[01:08:34.157 --> 01:08:34.357]  Aaron.
[01:08:34.597 --> 01:08:35.757]  Hey, how are you doing, Jakari?
[01:08:35.777 --> 01:08:36.537]  Great to talk to you on camera.
[01:08:36.557 --> 01:08:37.218]  Doing good, doing good.
[01:08:37.578 --> 01:08:43.499]  Now, we see this statement by Whole Foods saying that they carry GMOs, but so does everybody else.
[01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:47.120]  So what's the relevance of Whole Foods carrying a GMO product?
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:52.741]  Well, for people who don't know the Whole Foods store, they've become the biggest advancers of organic produce.
[01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:56.862]  All their marketing is aimed towards the fact that they have purely organic foods.
[01:08:57.382 --> 01:09:01.283]  But, you know, they're a grocery store, so they have to make other foods available as well.
[01:09:01.923 --> 01:09:10.752]  Now the larger problem is that GMOs have infiltrated our food supply so much, they've got 90% of all corn coming from purely GMO sources.
[01:09:10.832 --> 01:09:14.536]  Same with soy, same with cottonseed oil, and same with canola.
[01:09:14.856 --> 01:09:19.360]  And they put byproducts of that corn, the canola, the soy, in all kinds of foods.
[01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.603]  Pancake mixes and breadings and
[01:09:22.123 --> 01:09:24.024]  And just anything you find off the shelf.
[01:09:24.065 --> 01:09:31.830]  So there's a lot of GMO food ingredients in Whole Foods even though they have definitely made an effort to push for organic foods.
[01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:35.573]  Now the problem though is there's been pressure behind the scenes.
[01:09:35.973 --> 01:09:41.717]  They're clearly trying to clamp down on the organic market as Monsanto continues to try to take over the market.
[01:09:42.117 --> 01:09:44.718]  And we're really looking at a cornered beast with Monsanto.
[01:09:45.038 --> 01:09:48.559]  You've got a lot of people in America who have woken up to the dangers of GMO.
[01:09:48.599 --> 01:09:54.501]  You've got videos like Jeffrey M. Smith's video, a lot of studies, research that's been done.
[01:09:54.561 --> 01:10:02.444]  We just saw the big GMO corn study showing that it does cause tumors in rats when they do a long-term study instead of just a short-term study.
[01:10:02.604 --> 01:10:02.744]  Right.
[01:10:02.924 --> 01:10:05.044]  There's a lot of really bad dangers with GMO.
[01:10:05.084 --> 01:10:07.005]  People's lives are at stake over this issue.
[01:10:07.045 --> 01:10:16.098]  Now, before we get too far into this, GMOs are genetically modified organisms, or things that are made in a laboratory, most famously by companies like Monsanto.
[01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:19.803]  Like you said, they have corn and many other crops.
[01:10:20.544 --> 01:10:23.989]  So, can you tell us a little bit about the GMO process and why these things are dangerous?
[01:10:24.488 --> 01:10:32.013]  Well, they've got genetically modified, basically bacteria strains that they change certain traits in that they think will produce something they want.
[01:10:32.393 --> 01:10:35.535]  The most popular GMO crops are pesticide resistant.
[01:10:35.915 --> 01:10:45.841]  They're designed so you can spray copious amounts of Monsanto's Roundup on them or other herbicides and the plants will resist it and continue to grow and it will kill all the other weeds.
[01:10:46.361 --> 01:10:53.446]  The problem is we end up eating that pesticide, or in another variety of the same crops, they produce their own pesticide.
[01:10:53.526 --> 01:11:04.954]  Either way, we end up eating a lot more pesticide, the environment sucks up a lot more pesticide, and the plants themselves mutate over time, as do the insects that come across them, and so on and so forth.
[01:11:05.014 --> 01:11:07.416]  It's really this larger playing with God issue.
[01:11:08.116 --> 01:11:30.258]  And the bottom line is, our bodies have learned to process certain kinds of foods, have learned what the body wants over thousands of years, and there's little codes inside the DNA of the different particles of food, and that interacts with the body in a certain way, and we're just looking at new varieties of food the body isn't used to, it doesn't know how to produce, and that's why we're seeing allergies crop up and
[01:11:31.119 --> 01:11:36.641]  All new numbers, different kinds of diseases, new autoimmune and digestive disorders.
[01:11:37.041 --> 01:11:43.304]  All these things are springing up and the numbers are skyrocketing as we see GMOs introduced into our food supply.
[01:11:43.504 --> 01:11:53.088]  Now, speaking of allergies, there's an article that just came out, I believe it was today, Natural News, Mike Adams, they posted something talking about GMO cows.
[01:11:53.697 --> 01:12:04.682]  How they've cloned these cows to produce genetically modified milk that are supposed to be allergen free or at least have a reduced number of allergens in them.
[01:12:04.702 --> 01:12:06.083]  I'm sure they have a bunch of other stuff.
[01:12:06.303 --> 01:12:10.765]  They say even in an article they claim that the cow that they cloned was born without a tail.
[01:12:11.451 --> 01:12:15.753]  You know, so it maybe doesn't have any allergens, but probably has other things in there that can harm you and your family.
[01:12:15.933 --> 01:12:18.034]  It's really creepy what they're doing with this stuff.
[01:12:18.154 --> 01:12:28.759]  Even if it wasn't physically dangerous to us, it's still a really bad practice because of the monopoly and because we don't want to eradicate natural supplies of food and livestock and so forth.
[01:12:28.779 --> 01:12:31.361]  We don't need purely synthetic breast milk.
[01:12:32.021 --> 01:12:36.003]  We probably should just promote mothers still producing breast milk for their own children.
[01:12:36.563 --> 01:12:41.426]  That seems like a common sense approach, but the fact is it is causing a lot of physical harm.
[01:12:41.727 --> 01:12:44.348]  And Monsanto and the other biotech firms know this.
[01:12:44.448 --> 01:12:47.010]  They know that consumers don't want to eat GMOs.
[01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:53.695]  They've done different studies on the degree to which people avoid buying GMOs when it's labeled when they're informed.
[01:12:54.055 --> 01:13:01.580]  That's why Monsanto has been working so hard to keep mandatory labeling away from the American consumer so that we don't know what's in our food.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.562]  And that's why it's a big issue right now in California.
[01:13:04.582 --> 01:13:06.084]  You've heard about Prop 37.
[01:13:06.664 --> 01:13:12.089]  Yes, which requires them to put mandatory laboring of things that are genetically modified.
[01:13:12.529 --> 01:13:20.716]  Right, and you've got a lot of, you know, organic advocates fighting against it, saying they want to see Prop 37 approved, they want to see it become law.
[01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:27.501]  You've got Monsanto, you've got Pepsi and Coca-Cola, other people producing genetically modified organisms.
[01:13:27.561 --> 01:13:28.042]  They've spent
[01:13:28.662 --> 01:13:35.448]  In excess of $25 million opposing Prop 37, trying to make sure this does not become a precedent in the U.S.
[01:13:35.848 --> 01:13:45.316]  or anywhere else around the world, and they've also got all these newspapers lined up preaching how horrible it would be if we just had to label food, if consumers had to know what they were eating.
[01:13:45.336 --> 01:13:51.061]  Oh, that'd be such a hassle to read extra lines saying that, hey, this is a genetically modified organism.
[01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:52.411]  That'd be so terrible.
[01:13:52.792 --> 01:14:01.984]  But speaking of the Proposition 37, in this Whole Foods blog here that they've released, they even list their support for Proposition 37.
[01:14:02.545 --> 01:14:05.929]  So do you think that that does anything to put a kinder, gentler face?
[01:14:06.670 --> 01:14:09.772]  On Whole Foods, if they do support Proposition 37?
[01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:16.337]  Well, Whole Foods is becoming its own controversy because they've been for decades the leading advocate for organic foods.
[01:14:16.357 --> 01:14:19.079]  They've been against genetically modified foods in many ways.
[01:14:19.479 --> 01:14:20.640]  They've helped put it on the shelves.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:21.461]  Oh, that's great!
[01:14:22.001 --> 01:14:33.050]  But in recent years there's been political pressure and, you know, a lot of the critics within the organic foods movement have began calling attention to that, questioning their motives, and they've posted a lot of that evidence.
[01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:40.936]  I've started looking into it, and that's why we're here today, because Organic Spies is one of the groups that tried to put a spotlight on Whole Foods' practices.
[01:14:41.536 --> 01:14:42.416]  Questioning what they did.
[01:14:42.456 --> 01:14:43.697]  So they did a hidden video.
[01:14:44.057 --> 01:14:55.241]  They went into Whole Foods stores in California, knowing that Prop 37 was coming up, and wanting to point out the fact that Whole Foods has not donated financially to Prop 37, even though they've been promoting it.
[01:14:56.135 --> 01:14:56.656]  In theory.
[01:14:57.116 --> 01:15:04.463]  And they further are trying to expose the fact that there's so many ingredients that contain or may contain GMO ingredients that are sold at Whole Foods.
[01:15:04.903 --> 01:15:07.125]  So they talked to different employees and that video went up.
[01:15:07.266 --> 01:15:08.607]  It was an interesting expose.
[01:15:08.627 --> 01:15:10.228]  It was starting to go viral.
[01:15:10.308 --> 01:15:12.851]  Mike Adams, other people on the internet wrote about it.
[01:15:13.491 --> 01:15:14.792]  We ran the story a few days ago.
[01:15:14.852 --> 01:15:20.877]  Whole Foods knowingly engages in massive GMO deception, says undercover video by organic spies.
[01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:22.338]  And they made their argument.
[01:15:22.458 --> 01:15:23.119]  Maybe they're right.
[01:15:23.259 --> 01:15:25.701]  You can decide for yourself if you could watch the video.
[01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:27.862]  The problem is, they pulled that video today.
[01:15:28.143 --> 01:15:28.323]  Yeah.
[01:15:28.623 --> 01:15:31.145]  You guys can see it right there on the screen.
[01:15:32.796 --> 01:15:34.318]  This video has been removed.
[01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:35.139]  It has.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:41.167]  And so then Whole Foods followed up on that video by officially responding to it on their blog.
[01:15:41.488 --> 01:15:43.370]  That's what you were reading from just a minute ago.
[01:15:43.771 --> 01:15:46.514]  And they admit that they do have ingredients with GMOs.
[01:15:46.534 --> 01:15:47.355]  So debate over.
[01:15:47.796 --> 01:15:48.676]  They sell GMOs.
[01:15:49.117 --> 01:15:51.258]  They are against GMOs in many respects.
[01:15:51.298 --> 01:15:58.582]  They promote organic foods, and we should support them where they're doing that, but we have to call out the fact that there's a lot of deceptive labeling going on.
[01:15:59.162 --> 01:16:03.544]  Chief among that is this whole sub-movement where a lot of products are now labeled natural.
[01:16:03.985 --> 01:16:06.246]  They'll say natural peanut butter, natural this.
[01:16:06.706 --> 01:16:08.027]  Sounds like it's probably organic.
[01:16:08.527 --> 01:16:09.147]  Sounds that way.
[01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:14.289]  But actually, natural is just a buzz term that allows them to put pretty much any ingredients in there.
[01:16:14.969 --> 01:16:19.970]  You know, there's probably a few things that don't fall under natural, but there's no regulation for these labels, and that's the big problem.
[01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:34.854]  So, we see a mislabeling, or at least kind of a misinformation campaign, to where you go, you pick up, let's say you get some natural peanut butter, makes you think that you have some nice, wholesome peanuts and sugar and maybe some other things in there, but you don't expect
[01:16:35.695 --> 01:16:45.246]  Yeah, it's become a specifically deceptive term.
[01:16:45.286 --> 01:16:48.670]  I mean, working families, who has time to sit there and read every ingredient?
[01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:54.217]  I've tried to make a practice of it myself, but even when I get used to a product, I start reaching for it on the shelf.
[01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:58.641]  The next time I'm there, and months later, if they change it, am I still reading that label?
[01:16:59.141 --> 01:17:07.669]  It's a good question, but the reason we're talking about Whole Foods is because they have been proponents of GMO labeling, but they haven't backed Prop 37.
[01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:09.091]  And the question is why?
[01:17:09.451 --> 01:17:13.975]  And a lot of people point to a meeting that happened a year and a half ago with the USDA.
[01:17:14.015 --> 01:17:14.616]  That's the U.S.
[01:17:14.656 --> 01:17:15.817]  Department of Agriculture.
[01:17:16.337 --> 01:17:18.739]  The head of that under Obama is Tom Vilsack.
[01:17:19.574 --> 01:17:25.700]  He used to be the governor of Iowa, which as you know is the largest corn-producing state in the nation.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:27.602]  Most of that corn is now GMO.
[01:17:27.962 --> 01:17:33.187]  So it's a huge Monsanto-oriented biotech GMO lobby based in Iowa.
[01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:37.832]  They clearly have influence with people like Tom Vilsack, and we're going to go through a lot of those articles.
[01:17:38.192 --> 01:17:47.079]  But a year and a half ago there was a big debate over whether or not to deregulate, in other words to allow Monsanto to grow genetically engineered alfalfa.
[01:17:47.319 --> 01:17:54.985]  Now that's a crop they feed to a lot of livestock, humans eat it too, but it's mainly used to feed the animals that we later eat in these stores.
[01:17:55.345 --> 01:17:57.587]  And so if you're feeding them genetically engineered foods,
[01:17:58.327 --> 01:17:59.788]  Should there be a label required for that?
[01:17:59.849 --> 01:18:00.849]  That's part of the debate.
[01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:06.354]  Now, Whole Foods, along with several other big organic labels, went to this meeting.
[01:18:06.414 --> 01:18:08.676]  They agreed to sit down at the table with Monsanto.
[01:18:08.716 --> 01:18:15.181]  They agreed to sit down with Tom Vilsack of the USDA in order to do a compromise deal, what they call a coexisting.
[01:18:15.401 --> 01:18:15.721]  Right.
[01:18:15.761 --> 01:18:30.148]  And they had reasons to believe that this was a good position because they were told they would not consider an outright ban, that basically one way or another Monsanto and the other companies, DuPont among them, would be allowed to grow alfalfa and that opens the door for so many other crops.
[01:18:30.488 --> 01:18:32.969]  So they had great expectations going into that meeting.
[01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:34.310]  Maybe they had the right intentions.
[01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:39.993]  It turned out USDA won't impose restrictions on biotech alfalfa crop.
[01:18:40.273 --> 01:18:45.577]  That was in the Wall Street Journal, so they decided they're going to abandon a proposal to restrict Monsanto.
[01:18:46.397 --> 01:19:01.688]  That went through, and this led to Ronnie Cummings, he's from the Organic Consumers Association and other organic associations, looking closer at Whole Foods, criticizing their connections, in particular the alleged coziness between Tom Vilsack, who again is
[01:19:02.228 --> 01:19:11.630]  The Agriculture Secretary here in the US, his cozy relationship with Monsanto, and the allegation that they've been personal friends, that there's been campaign contributions.
[01:19:12.011 --> 01:19:15.151]  You see this headline, Organic Elite Surrenders to Monsanto.
[01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:15.932]  Now what?
[01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:21.033]  And it talks about the disappointment of why would they compromise when they've been fighting so hard on this?
[01:19:22.114 --> 01:19:32.966]  And again, why aren't they supporting Prop 37 now, when Monsanto and the other players have put so much money into killing that bill, when it could be a very helpful bill for the very things Whole Foods have been fighting for for all these years.
[01:19:33.026 --> 01:19:34.668]  And you guys can see the article right there on the screen.
[01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:41.633]  You've got Whole Foods CEOs disappointed about that USAID decision on alfalfa.
[01:19:42.034 --> 01:19:43.214]  Walter Raab is one of them.
[01:19:43.254 --> 01:19:46.056]  He's the co-CEO of Whole Foods.
[01:19:46.597 --> 01:19:49.459]  And so when did Whole Foods begin to get pressured?
[01:19:49.839 --> 01:19:56.063]  Alex pointed out on air today there was SEC filings against Whole Foods other CEO John Mackey.
[01:19:56.143 --> 01:20:04.869]  He had written some comments anonymously online targeting other organic competitors and they brought an antitrust lawsuit against him, told him
[01:20:05.309 --> 01:20:08.211]  Basically, that they were considering prosecuting him full-time.
[01:20:08.612 --> 01:20:10.293]  That hasn't happened, at least yet.
[01:20:10.353 --> 01:20:11.914]  That was back in 2007.
[01:20:12.275 --> 01:20:17.098]  But you see in Forbes, you see in New York Times, that they began to acquire Whole Foods' chief.
[01:20:17.519 --> 01:20:20.541]  So is that when they began to bend on Monsanto?
[01:20:20.621 --> 01:20:22.963]  Is that when they began to give in to some of the pressure?
[01:20:23.583 --> 01:20:26.606]  Well, we don't know all the answers, but those are important questions.
[01:20:27.286 --> 01:20:30.489]  And then, so I started looking into the campaign contributions.
[01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:31.949]  Follow the money.
[01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:33.130]  Follow the money.
[01:20:33.190 --> 01:20:34.230]  I looked up John Mackey.
[01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:35.251]  We'll get to him in a minute.
[01:20:35.571 --> 01:20:37.512]  But I also looked up the co-CEO.
[01:20:37.572 --> 01:20:38.712]  His name is Walter Robb.
[01:20:39.092 --> 01:20:42.454]  He's been with the company for 20 years or so, since 1991.
[01:20:42.874 --> 01:20:44.135]  He's based in California.
[01:20:44.455 --> 01:20:46.236]  He's been a big Democratic contributor.
[01:20:46.556 --> 01:20:47.196]  I don't mind that.
[01:20:47.516 --> 01:20:48.457]  That's not who I support.
[01:20:49.817 --> 01:20:54.840]  We're going to get into how Barack Obama has bent over backwards for Monsanto and the biotech industry.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.881]  So did Romney 20 years ago.
[01:20:57.001 --> 01:20:57.962]  So did Clinton.
[01:20:58.022 --> 01:20:59.043]  So did both Bushes.
[01:20:59.443 --> 01:21:00.383]  So it's a real problem.
[01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:02.024]  Our whole government has been bought out.
[01:21:03.345 --> 01:21:05.026]  But he did donate to Barack Obama.
[01:21:05.066 --> 01:21:09.869]  But the one that's even more striking is that he donated to Christy Vilsack.
[01:21:10.169 --> 01:21:19.978]  Christy Vilsack is the wife of Tom Vilsack, the USDA Secretary of Agriculture we were just discussing, who's got this long relationship with Monsanto.
[01:21:19.999 --> 01:21:21.520]  There you go, you see it right there on the screen.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.961]  Six reasons why Obama appointed him.
[01:21:22.981 --> 01:21:31.710]  So why, why, why would Walter Raab donate to someone who has done everything to destroy the organic movement and roll over to let Monsanto have a monopoly in this country?
[01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:33.812]  Why would he donate to that guy's wife?
[01:21:34.392 --> 01:21:35.092]  Good question.
[01:21:35.132 --> 01:21:36.973]  What else you got in your stock?
[01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:38.433]  Well, we got some supporting stuff.
[01:21:38.473 --> 01:21:41.034]  This goes back to when Obama was coming into office.
[01:21:41.414 --> 01:21:44.295]  It's meet Monsanto's number one lobbyist, Barack Obama.
[01:21:44.855 --> 01:21:48.196]  Now, among the people he put in his cabinet were Michael Taylor.
[01:21:48.256 --> 01:21:50.337]  He used to be a vice president for Monsanto.
[01:21:50.397 --> 01:21:52.738]  Before that, he was a lobbyist for Monsanto.
[01:21:52.778 --> 01:21:54.778]  Before that, he was a lawyer for Monsanto.
[01:21:55.138 --> 01:21:58.319]  He's been with Monsanto and related companies for many years.
[01:21:58.859 --> 01:22:03.701]  And Obama put him in as food safety deputy czar of the FDA.
[01:22:04.321 --> 01:22:06.903]  This guy is in charge of our food safety regulation.
[01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:09.005]  You've seen the studies since you've been here.
[01:22:09.085 --> 01:22:12.428]  I don't know if you were paying close attention to GMO before you started working here.
[01:22:12.688 --> 01:22:13.448]  I knew of it.
[01:22:13.508 --> 01:22:16.551]  I didn't know how deep the rabbit hole went, so to speak.
[01:22:16.571 --> 01:22:20.214]  But you got a guy from Monsanto that they've...
[01:22:21.114 --> 01:22:27.418]  You've got all these studies showing that Monsanto's GE crops may be dangerous, harmful to your health, causing tumors and rats.
[01:22:27.818 --> 01:22:33.261]  And here's this guy from Monsanto in our government, supposedly regulating through the FDA.
[01:22:33.801 --> 01:22:36.082]  Well, you know he's just rubber stamping for their policies.
[01:22:36.442 --> 01:22:39.764]  Even if you want to be objective, it's hard not to when you know people personally.
[01:22:40.144 --> 01:22:43.846]  That's why there used to be codes of ethics for not having a conflict of interest.
[01:22:44.366 --> 01:22:45.987]  Meaning you can't serve two masters.
[01:22:46.047 --> 01:22:47.268]  Nobody can serve two masters.
[01:22:47.708 --> 01:23:02.978]  So there's Michael Taylor at the FDA, hugely questionable figure, and again we have Whole Foods co-CEO Walter Raab donating politically, financially, to the wife of Tom Vilsack, who Obama also appointed, and he's been involved in all kinds of things.
[01:23:03.018 --> 01:23:15.626]  Here's one article, six reasons why Obama appointing Monsanto's buddy, former Iowa Governor Vilsack, for USD head would be a terrible idea, and it gets into his support for pharmaceutical crops.
[01:23:16.766 --> 01:23:22.409]  It gets into how he's a friend of biotech bullies pushing GE drugs in corn crops.
[01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:29.293]  That's where they were growing herpes virus treatment, AIDS virus treatment, all open air in Iowa.
[01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:30.814]  There's a big controversy over that.
[01:23:31.294 --> 01:23:42.901]  I wrote an article on it just looking back at the fact that circa 2002, you had escaped admittedly cross-pollinated diseased GMAs that was growing pharmaceuticals.
[01:23:43.121 --> 01:23:43.181]  Wow.
[01:23:43.261 --> 01:23:44.802]  And it was mixing with the food supply.
[01:23:45.482 --> 01:23:47.044]  There were some minor fines.
[01:23:49.166 --> 01:24:02.757]  Tom Vilsack has also been involved in cloned meat and all kinds of stuff with Monsanto, with the other biotech people, and there's no way somebody like Walter Robb of Whole Foods wouldn't be aware of those issues, wouldn't find them important.
[01:24:03.078 --> 01:24:10.544]  The fact that he's donating to the wife of Tom Vilsack is extremely troubling because he has to be one of the most informed people on this issue.
[01:24:11.065 --> 01:24:11.205]  Wow.
[01:24:11.701 --> 01:24:13.764]  I mean, he's been involved with it for 20 plus years.
[01:24:13.964 --> 01:24:17.208]  Well, Aaron, in the short time we have left, do you have a few more articles you'd like to run through?
[01:24:17.228 --> 01:24:22.515]  Yeah, I mean, I just want to point out how much this has pervaded the entire government at the executive branch.
[01:24:22.895 --> 01:24:26.600]  It is in no way just Obama, although he's been completely subservient.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:27.160]  Thank you.
[01:24:45.974 --> 01:24:47.615]  I don't know if you can see that on camera.
[01:24:47.995 --> 01:24:57.561]  And Gary Johnson, that's fine, I'm not against these people donating money to candidates if they want to support them, but why would someone so high up in the organic movement be supporting these terrible candidates?
[01:24:58.141 --> 01:25:03.044]  And then you got this article, does Monsanto man Mitt Romney secretly eat organic?
[01:25:03.884 --> 01:25:05.045]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:25:05.745 --> 01:25:08.807]  He does, and it gets into how he and his wife are obsessed with this stuff.
[01:25:08.867 --> 01:25:24.694]  But you know, Alex and I covered this in that mini-documentary, New World Order, Blueprint of Mad Men, how all these elite people pushing GMO crops on the entire world, Bill Gates among them, David Rockefeller, all saying everybody's got to eat this stuff, it's good for the earth, this is how we're going to feed the world.
[01:25:25.074 --> 01:25:30.357]  They all obsessively avoid GMO, and this article gets into how that was true of Clinton,
[01:25:30.857 --> 01:25:34.920]  His family, while they were in office, it was true of George W. Bush when they were in office.
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:40.043]  And right here in the world, according to Monsanto, you see footage of George H.W.
[01:25:40.083 --> 01:25:49.730]  Bush, along with Dan Quayle, getting GMOs fast-tracked, approved in the government, getting them to bypass the ordinary FDA regulations, lowering the regulations.
[01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:55.534]  And you see footage of him inspecting some of this pharmaceutical-grade GMO crop.
[01:25:56.134 --> 01:25:58.695]  And you're telling me these people don't know what's going on.
[01:25:58.895 --> 01:26:00.816]  They have their own private garden at the White House.
[01:26:01.116 --> 01:26:03.137]  Yeah, that's the kind of stuff we're talking about.
[01:26:03.197 --> 01:26:18.644]  But they put in these Monsanto people in the regulatory positions and ordinary people have to eat this GMO crud, which again the studies suggest could be causing cancer, sterility, a hidden sleeper, third-generation sterility where it doesn't show up until your grandchildren.
[01:26:19.684 --> 01:26:23.586]  This is epidemic-level stuff, and we're not being told the truth about it.
[01:26:23.746 --> 01:26:30.389]  There's a cover-up at the top, and the organic elites, the presidential elites, everybody else, they are avoiding the GMOs.
[01:26:30.809 --> 01:26:32.110]  By the way, there's one more article.
[01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:34.811]  GM food banned in Monsanto canteens.
[01:26:35.411 --> 01:26:38.613]  The scientists don't eat the GMO food that they produce at Monsanto.
[01:26:38.633 --> 01:26:42.934]  I don't know if you guys can get a shot of that or not, but... So, that's just a little bit down the rabbit hole for you.
[01:26:42.974 --> 01:26:44.535]  This research is endless.
[01:26:44.775 --> 01:26:48.497]  I'm not the most perfect presenter of it, but I assure you the information is there.
[01:26:48.957 --> 01:26:51.259]  It's another solid report from Aaron Dykes.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.622]  This is a great, great eye-opener.
[01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:56.825]  I learned a lot of stuff just sitting there and listening to you.
[01:26:57.205 --> 01:27:01.350]  And like you said, GM, genetically modified food is banned at Monsanto.
[01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:04.453]  They don't even eat their own food that they produce.
[01:27:04.853 --> 01:27:07.895]  So we see another incredibly in-depth report from Mr. Aaron Dykes.
[01:27:07.915 --> 01:27:09.056]  We would definitely like to thank him.
[01:27:09.076 --> 01:27:11.858]  We encourage you at home to read these articles.
[01:27:11.898 --> 01:27:12.918]  Check them out for yourselves.
[01:27:13.299 --> 01:27:15.140]  Make sure that everything he said was accurate.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.761]  I'm sure you will find that is the case.
[01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:18.982]  So that's it for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:27:19.002 --> 01:27:20.003]  I want to thank Aaron.
[01:27:20.023 --> 01:27:21.224]  I want to thank Richard Belzer.
[01:27:22.204 --> 01:27:29.489]  Congratulations to Melissa Milton for that great piece and giving all our support to those in San Antonio fighting for the RFID freedom.
[01:27:29.809 --> 01:27:32.070]  And I'm Ja'Kari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
