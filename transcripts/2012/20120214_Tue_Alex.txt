[00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:07.525]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:08.986]  You want answers?
[00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.627]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:14.889]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.572]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:43.116]  Well, we've got another insanely important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:45.302]  It is Valentine's Day, February...
[00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:52.509]  14th, 2012, and we are going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:54.930]  We're going to have open phones as well.
[00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.011]  Adam Kakesh is going to be joining us for about 20 minutes at the start of the hour.
[00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:07.873]  He's organizing a big march of veterans to the Capitol in support of Ron Paul.
[00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:13.894]  And there's some new TV ads running that point out that he is getting 70 plus percent.
[00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:15.275]  They've got the graphs and the numbers.
[00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:24.718]  Of the support that the military is giving all the Republican candidates and Obama combined, he gets 70 plus percent.
[00:01:25.478 --> 00:01:31.380]  Showing that our military is full of patriotic Americans who are awake more than anybody else.
[00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:41.143]  Now again, they've gotten bad apples out of the military, or those that are dumbed down, and trained them to carry out illegal operations domestically.
[00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:45.325]  And that's what I'm being told by the military is the big thing waking folks up.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:54.502]  Because it is really causing an issue because up until now they were taught the Constitution, Bill of Rights, they were taught you don't do these type of things.
[00:01:54.962 --> 00:02:00.103]  Secret arrests, torture, spying on Americans, training to have war with American people.
[00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:06.725]  They know this is what they were taught the Soviet Russians did and the Communist Chinese and the bad guys do.
[00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:08.945]  Everybody knows what the bad guys do.
[00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:14.507]  And what the bankers are doing that have taken over America, it's very elementary.
[00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:15.307]  It's very simple.
[00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.772]  My dear Watson, is establishing classical tyranny.
[00:02:20.553 --> 00:02:21.454]  This is not freedom.
[00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:23.115]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:25.858]  That's why I tend to get so frustrated all the time.
[00:02:26.678 --> 00:02:30.422]  Because this stuff is so obvious, so ridiculously crystal clear.
[00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:37.450]  So, we've got Adam Kokesh popping in via video Skype for radio and TV listeners and viewers.
[00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:44.878]  And then, having been on about a month and a half or so, always enjoy having the one, the only, fiery Max Keiser on with us.
[00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:49.603]  He'll be on to talk about the global economy and what's happening in our world today.
[00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:59.812]  Now, there's an article that we put out yesterday afternoon that's now up on Drudge Report on the left-hand side, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:03:00.772 --> 00:03:04.395]  It's good to go there because it's already scrolled off the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:06.057]  That's a problem we've got.
[00:03:06.077 --> 00:03:11.762]  We're trying to work on a way to have our really key top stories stay somewhere on the front page.
[00:03:11.802 --> 00:03:14.104]  Maybe we'll create a new subsection
[00:03:15.293 --> 00:03:21.897]  That is a little bit larger than the featured area at the bottom that's just our authors' stories.
[00:03:22.997 --> 00:03:24.778]  And we've got so many writers and authors now.
[00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.019]  I don't know.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.521]  I mean, how do you pick a story that you think's the most important?
[00:03:30.302 --> 00:03:31.322]  I guess I could do that.
[00:03:31.342 --> 00:03:36.185]  Or I guess you could do, like a lot of folks do, whatever gets the most comments is voted up.
[00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:43.249]  But sometimes it's silly stories that, or a comedy story that ends up getting, you know, a thousand comments, so it'd be the top story.
[00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:47.111]  But I guess that's what the people think's important, so I guess go with that.
[00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:48.632]  I don't know, we're working on that.
[00:03:48.652 --> 00:03:53.718]  The point is, Obama to unleash truth teams to counter negative coverage.
[00:03:53.738 --> 00:03:55.540]  And this article went up at the end of the show yesterday.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.222]  I didn't cover it much, but I'm gonna try to dig up.
[00:03:58.623 --> 00:04:01.105]  I know it's on YouTube, last time I checked a few years ago.
[00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:10.536]  The newscast, where they actually say, we have the transcript in here, they actually say, if you criticize Obama, we're going to arrest you.
[00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:14.458]  Because criticizing him is lying about him.
[00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:19.160]  I mean, this is worse than North Korea or something.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.763]  Just absolutely, absolutely bizarre.
[00:04:25.038 --> 00:04:26.639]  I have this type of stuff going on.
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.943]  So we're going to be going over that because they're back at it yet again today.
[00:04:31.963 --> 00:04:40.668]  A little side note, Oliver Stone's son converts to Islam in Iran and some people are asking if this is a publicity stunt.
[00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:49.334]  I know Sean Stone and he was telling me he might convert to Islam.
[00:04:52.418 --> 00:04:54.400]  And I guess he's done it, so that's big news.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.722]  But look, all the news is coming up.
[00:04:56.742 --> 00:04:57.283]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:00.165]  I had tried everything.
[00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:02.367]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:05:02.587 --> 00:05:05.290]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.215]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:16.921]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:27.867]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:05:28.607 --> 00:05:32.749]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.091]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:39.113]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:40.494]  Now that's results.
[00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:47.320]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.024]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:05:55.966 --> 00:05:57.227]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[00:05:58.612 --> 00:05:59.873]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:59.913 --> 00:06:05.275]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:06:05.516 --> 00:06:10.138]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:06:10.518 --> 00:06:10.918]  It's true.
[00:06:10.998 --> 00:06:15.561]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.804]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:23.246]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:28.249]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:29.330]  And here's the best part.
[00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.332]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:06:32.632 --> 00:06:35.914]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:39.096]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:06:39.437 --> 00:06:41.318]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:06:41.658 --> 00:06:42.579]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:47.983]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:54.971]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:06:55.272 --> 00:06:57.675]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:01.327]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[00:07:01.607 --> 00:07:05.109]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:05.789]  Number 10.
[00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:08.110]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.590]  Number 9.
[00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.911]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:14.232]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:14.232]  7.
[00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:16.613]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[00:07:17.834 --> 00:07:16.613]  6.
[00:07:18.194 --> 00:07:20.335]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.

[00:07:24.596 --> 00:07:28.317]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[00:07:28.577 --> 00:07:31.658]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.079]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:42.121]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:43.261]  Folks, don't wait.
[00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.622]  Get prepared now.
[00:07:44.682 --> 00:07:46.363]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:51.585]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[00:07:51.725 --> 00:07:57.647]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:59.748 --> 00:08:02.029]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:05.310]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.803 --> 00:08:28.019]  Well, we've got a clip of it in the Obama deception news out of Missouri saying if you run a misleading ad and they're going to decide, the police are, about Obama saying he's not a Christian or he's a socialist, that you're going to be arrested.
[00:08:29.554 --> 00:08:37.600]  And that was announced in Illinois, Missouri, Florida, Vermont, of all places, which is usually a pretty free state.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:56.614]  Well, they're back announcing it again, having prosecutors and police and others say that if you say something about Obama that they say is not true, not found by a court, not found by a civil court, but if they say you're lying about our great dear leader, that I guess you can be, you know, disappeared.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.401]  And here's the headline.
[00:08:58.461 --> 00:09:01.645]  Obama to unleash truth squads to counter negative coverage.
[00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:06.992]  GOP describes squads of supporters as propaganda teams to deceive voters.
[00:09:07.032 --> 00:09:09.034]  Well, they're saying Obama's deceiving.
[00:09:09.655 --> 00:09:10.656]  Not allowed to say that.
[00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:11.998]  I guess arrest the GOP.
[00:09:13.755 --> 00:09:15.596]  So there is that report.
[00:09:16.197 --> 00:09:19.699]  Here's another one out of the Washington Times, just some miscellaneous news out of the gates here.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.103]  Fed shut down Amish Farm for selling fresh milk to their neighbors.
[00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:28.525]  And they say they're going to shut the farm down altogether now.
[00:09:29.046 --> 00:09:42.115]  And you know, I actually have a raw milk from outside San Antonio here that I drink every morning as I go on air with whey protein, which itself comes from raw milk, the brand I use.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.041]  Pure evil.
[00:09:47.203 --> 00:09:47.603]  Pure evil.
[00:09:47.643 --> 00:09:48.384]  I'm having my breakfast.
[00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:49.426]  I've been up since 6am.
[00:09:49.446 --> 00:09:50.127]  I'm having my breakfast.
[00:09:50.748 --> 00:09:53.052]  As I go on air, I'm a bad terrorist.
[00:09:54.113 --> 00:09:55.796]  And by the way, I'm not joking.
[00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:57.098]  According to the government, I'm evil.
[00:09:58.243 --> 00:10:04.705]  They've said that it's a felony to even buy the stuff according to their new interpretations.
[00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:10.487]  Doesn't matter if the Queen of England will only drink it and the rich elite are obsessed with it and fine restaurants serve it.
[00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:12.128]  They're all going to be left alone.
[00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:18.350]  You are going to drink the boiled, pasteurized, homogenized sludge.
[00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.592]  And why did, if you go back in the 50s on record, big dairies
[00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:35.834]  Lobby, and people like Kraft, lobby that produce cheese, or so-called cheese, to have raw milk banned for over-the-counter sale.
[00:10:36.895 --> 00:10:40.396]  Before you got it delivered every day, a little truck came by, put it right there at your door.
[00:10:41.537 --> 00:10:41.817]  Why?
[00:10:41.977 --> 00:10:49.139]  It lasts longer, it tastes better, it's a probiotic, good for your guts, good for your bacteria flora, because big
[00:10:51.431 --> 00:10:57.853]  Agra was basically bought up by Big Pharma, and they don't like to have to feed you something fresh.
[00:10:58.313 --> 00:11:06.236]  Because if any blood, or any pus, or any cow manure gets into regular fresh milk, the whole thing has to be thrown out.
[00:11:06.736 --> 00:11:09.617]  You've got to keep it neurotically clean.
[00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:16.960]  And it's very hard for big industries to industrialize producing fresh milk.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.381]  It's a small operation is what it's designed for.
[00:11:21.024 --> 00:11:25.105]  But if you boil it and cook it three or four times, it can have feces in it.
[00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:26.865]  Now, under regulations, it's allowed to.
[00:11:27.405 --> 00:11:28.586]  It can have blood and pus.
[00:11:28.626 --> 00:11:31.886]  They can overwork the cows and give them synthetic growth hormone.
[00:11:32.707 --> 00:11:33.547]  And that's what they do.
[00:11:34.847 --> 00:11:37.428]  So, they want to feed you.
[00:11:38.128 --> 00:11:43.289]  And by the way, my family's farmers on my dad's side and, you know, been involved in the dairy the whole nine yards.
[00:11:43.349 --> 00:11:44.149]  I've milked cows.
[00:11:44.689 --> 00:11:46.409]  I've had dairy experts on.
[00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:47.610]  I've had historians on.
[00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.670]  This is a fact.
[00:11:49.952 --> 00:11:54.714]  And it's the same way they put all these preservatives in garbage and food, so they can feed you rotten food.
[00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:55.775]  That's what MSG is.
[00:11:56.215 --> 00:12:04.740]  World War I, the Japanese learned on record how to add this toxic chemical, MSG, monosodium glutamate, a variant of salt.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.882]  They've changed the molecules so that even rotten meat would taste good.
[00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:14.805]  Because the Japanese didn't like eating rotten horse meat and stuff that was canned.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.503]  But the Japanese basically developed what got turned into spam today.
[00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:27.409]  And it's very toxic, but makes you want to eat more, more, more, and makes a rotten surat taste like mama's cherry pie.
[00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:39.258]  So that's what's going on on that front, and they proudly announced the FDA wanted a two-year fight to shut down an Amish farmer who was selling fresh raw milk to eager customers.
[00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:42.282]  And so that is that.
[00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:46.285]  And they are announcing they're going to start coming after everybody.
[00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:52.669]  I know until about two years ago I could go once a week to the farmer's market in Austin.
[00:12:54.412 --> 00:13:05.595]  And they had Mennonite folks selling, driving down from near Waxahachie, selling cheese from raw milk and selling vegetables and stuff.
[00:13:06.295 --> 00:13:13.136]  And if you walked around by the back of their van and said, this is a private sale, you know, you're buying this privately from me.
[00:13:13.156 --> 00:13:16.437]  That's how it gets around all the federal and state garbage.
[00:13:16.777 --> 00:13:20.418]  You could buy a couple gallons of delicious milk that that
[00:13:21.437 --> 00:13:25.102]  Farmer had been pumping out the night before, or 3 a.m.
[00:13:25.142 --> 00:13:29.749]  in the morning some days, putting in the containers and driving it down to Austin.
[00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:33.726]  I mean, sometimes you got it, it was still warm.
[00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:41.313]  Not anymore, because they sent inspectors and harassers out there to shut all that down, outside of law.
[00:13:41.713 --> 00:13:42.714]  And they're shutting everything down.
[00:13:42.935 --> 00:13:45.477]  You try to sell peaches, side of the road, ain't happening.
[00:13:45.857 --> 00:13:48.840]  Try to sell cactuses to tourists, side of the road, ain't happening.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.042]  Try to have a lemonade stand, ain't happening.
[00:13:52.583 --> 00:13:59.426]  Girl Scout cookies ain't happening because they're here to crack down on the old-fashioned market and call it black market.
[00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:01.887]  You're not gonna associate with your neighbors.
[00:14:02.507 --> 00:14:15.993]  The Food Safety Act, pushed by Big Pharma and Big Agra, doesn't allow you to can strawberries and give them to your neighbor, or put carrots in a container and can them, or pickles.
[00:14:17.116 --> 00:14:19.717]  You cannot even give it to your neighbor.
[00:14:19.757 --> 00:14:23.479]  You cannot serve it to your neighbor when they come to your home.
[00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:25.740]  It's just the end of basic humanity.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.522]  It's humans being inserted into the modern Agenda 21 prison that is totally unsustainable.
[00:14:32.083 --> 00:14:33.283]  But they call it sustainable.
[00:14:33.663 --> 00:14:43.728]  They always create counterfeits and take over any movement for sustainability, for the environment, and say it's about carbon dioxide, not about GMO and toxic waste.
[00:14:46.522 --> 00:14:50.406]  It's about carbon dioxide and taxing you and shutting down your farm and ranch.
[00:14:50.966 --> 00:14:57.272]  It's not about 9 out of 10 reactors worldwide publicly leaking radiation because they're 30, 40, 50 years old rotting.
[00:14:59.835 --> 00:15:02.157]  It's not about the troops using DU a death sentence.
[00:15:02.638 --> 00:15:08.844]  It's about carbon dioxide that you exhale and that plants respirate from.
[00:15:10.307 --> 00:15:11.188]  So, uh, there it is.
[00:15:11.228 --> 00:15:12.209]  They're very, very proud of that.
[00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.653]  London Guardian article, News Corp executives at risk of U.S.
[00:15:15.673 --> 00:15:17.374]  prosecution for willful blindness.
[00:15:18.195 --> 00:15:27.405]  American anti-corporation law holds company chiefs culpable for consciously avoiding knowledge of corrupt deeds at News Corp.
[00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.794]  And they're gearing up, I guess, for the Justice Department to look at clapping old Rupert Murdoch in irons.
[00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.275]  And boy, you see Fox News now.
[00:15:36.756 --> 00:15:39.357]  There's a lot of Obama worshipping going on.
[00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:45.101]  A lot of hosts are saying he's a man of the Lord, he's good, he cares about us.
[00:15:45.701 --> 00:15:47.783]  After all, the truth squads say he might be arrested.
[00:15:49.224 --> 00:15:50.665]  We're all learning about our new freedom.
[00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:51.666]  Of course, it doesn't even matter.
[00:15:51.706 --> 00:15:54.428]  Obama, I mean, if we don't get Ron Paul, it's Mitt Romney.
[00:15:54.448 --> 00:15:59.092]  I mean, that's a guy who's Barack Obama from a different party.
[00:16:00.733 --> 00:16:04.155]  I mean, he's a brother from another mother.
[00:16:05.617 --> 00:16:10.100]  These guys, the only difference is one has a D before his name, the other has an R before his name.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:17.706]  Exact same policies, but it's so much fun to hate Obama and to feel like you're a winner if your guy gets into office.
[00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:22.872]  Alright, that's just some of the little incendiary news articles.
[00:16:22.912 --> 00:16:23.512]  Here's another one.
[00:16:24.353 --> 00:16:29.457]  Vladimir Putin ridiculed after demanding Russians have more sex to halt declining population.
[00:16:30.478 --> 00:16:35.182]  Yeah, their population is smaller than Pakistan and Bangladesh now.
[00:16:35.983 --> 00:16:39.706]  It's gone down from 200 million to 142 million in the last 30 years.
[00:16:40.126 --> 00:16:41.708]  Communism didn't do too good for them.
[00:16:41.808 --> 00:16:42.469]  It was eugenics.
[00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:45.225]  And they do pay people to get married.
[00:16:45.245 --> 00:16:47.467]  They do encourage people to have children, large families.
[00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.448]  They got billboards up.
[00:16:48.928 --> 00:16:50.409]  The government pays you to have children.
[00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.471]  Boy, look at the difference.
[00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.792]  Again, I'm no fan of Putin.
[00:16:54.592 --> 00:16:55.773]  KGB guy, all this.
[00:16:55.793 --> 00:17:01.998]  But compared to the New World Order, he's just old-fashioned strongman trying to hold his crumbling country together.
[00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:06.531]  The globalists running our country are poisoning our food and water.
[00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:09.453]  Our population's at 1.3 replacement rate.
[00:17:09.473 --> 00:17:13.456]  For every two adults, they have 1.3 children, except for the giant immigrant influx.
[00:17:14.077 --> 00:17:15.898]  Western culture is completely dying.
[00:17:15.938 --> 00:17:17.720]  Pat Buchanan's written about it in Death of the West.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.201]  Japan's dying.
[00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:20.262]  They have 1.2.
[00:17:20.662 --> 00:17:21.022]  Italy's 1.2.
[00:17:21.363 --> 00:17:26.387]  I mean, all these cultures are dying because we're under the eugenic system.
[00:17:27.708 --> 00:17:32.896]  I mean, and then Putin's bad for saying there should be Russians in the future.
[00:17:34.389 --> 00:17:34.689]  I don't know.
[00:17:34.729 --> 00:17:45.659]  I mean, I don't want to see there being, you know, no South Africans in the future, or no Japanese in the future, or no Mexicans in the future, or no Germans in the future.
[00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:46.940]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:18:00.572]  The eugenicists have taught us to all hate ourselves and all hate our cultures, but only love the plastic, fake, MSG, aspartame, Miley Cyrus, garbage culture.
[00:18:01.292 --> 00:18:02.656]  Justin Bieber garbage.
[00:18:03.339 --> 00:18:06.508]  We have been totally and completely force-fed this death.
[00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:08.218]  And it's all by design.
[00:18:08.238 --> 00:18:14.001]  We have all the documents, how they destroy the family in the 20s and 30s, how they break it up, how they create welfare to make you dependent.
[00:18:14.362 --> 00:18:23.746]  Once you're dependent, then they play the welfare class off against the middle class, the real enemy, and force sterilization, then of the poor, in that next phase, and we're entering that next phase.
[00:18:24.327 --> 00:18:29.870]  And I read to you World Bank documents yesterday, where they said, have mobile sterilization vans.
[00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.271]  If you want to get your welfare, you'll have to be sterilized.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.741]  Of course, then it'll be moved on to everybody else as well.
[00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:40.723]  And then, of course, the Detroit newspaper came out yesterday and said, put steroids in the water for everybody.
[00:18:40.963 --> 00:18:42.204]  I got news for you, Jack.
[00:18:43.044 --> 00:18:44.384]  I got the White House science czar.
[00:18:44.404 --> 00:18:45.665]  I got the Rockefeller documents.
[00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:46.505]  I got them all.
[00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:48.106]  It's on record.
[00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:50.327]  They're already jacking the water.
[00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:52.828]  They're already jacking the food.
[00:18:53.328 --> 00:18:55.069]  They're already doing it.
[00:18:57.401 --> 00:19:10.706]  That's why people ask, well, why can the inner city people still have kids, whether they're black, white, Hispanic, but yuppies that are mainly white, but also Hispanic and black, why can't they have kids?
[00:19:10.746 --> 00:19:11.367]  It's real simple.
[00:19:13.428 --> 00:19:18.069]  When they're hitting you with soft kill stuff, if you're 16 or 17, you can still have a child on average.
[00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:23.832]  This stuff is cumulative to build up, so it can't be directed and pointed at one causal instrument.
[00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:27.768]  So you wait to be 30, 35, 40 to have a kid?
[00:19:27.788 --> 00:19:30.956]  You're gonna have to go get Buck Rogers type technology.
[00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:34.779]  To be able to have that child, which is exactly what the globalists want.
[00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:39.081]  They'll then sell you the treatments to have a child after they've made you infertile.
[00:19:39.462 --> 00:19:53.050]  But, by law, they're now announcing, as I said they would years ago, saying, but if you're going to get these therapies, we've got to be able to change genes that we say are bad, because now there's government funding involved under the socialist healthcare.
[00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.031]  So your child's going to have three parents.
[00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:58.053]  We're going to put somebody else's genetics in there to fix it.
[00:19:59.352 --> 00:20:04.713]  If you're having any problems with the IRS or a local revenue agency, I understand and I can help.
[00:20:05.393 --> 00:20:06.874]  I'm Tax Attorney Tony Dennison.
[00:20:07.294 --> 00:20:11.915]  When I was a kid, the IRS came after my mother's house because of mistaken information.
[00:20:12.355 --> 00:20:17.196]  Ever since then, I've dedicated my life to defending people in trouble with the IRS.
[00:20:17.576 --> 00:20:26.158]  I'm a real tax attorney, which means I have two law degrees, a standard law degree known as a JD, and a tax law degree known as a Masters of the Laws in Taxation.
[00:20:26.698 --> 00:20:31.200]  I've been practicing for 10 years and I've helped many of your fellow citizens in tax trouble.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:37.122]  If you're in tax trouble, you don't need to be alone and you don't need to call one of those fake lawyer clearinghouses.

[00:23:17.722 --> 00:23:18.682]  You already know why.
[00:23:18.942 --> 00:23:22.944]  It's the very real and growing dangers reported in the media every day.
[00:23:23.124 --> 00:23:24.365]  Now it's the what you must do.

[00:23:48.275 --> 00:23:48.755]  Or call 877-403-7076.
[00:23:48.775 --> 00:23:48.835]  877-403-7076.
[00:23:48.855 --> 00:23:49.436]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:24:15.236 --> 00:24:16.479]  We are back live.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:24.818]  I'm playing this because I saw in the news today that they're going to put more women in frontline combat in the Marine Corps and in the Army.
[00:24:26.058 --> 00:24:40.691]  That's what that old piece of propaganda was about with Jessica Lynch when they said that she had engaged in all this incredible combat and killed all of these Iraqi troops while the men cowered.
[00:24:40.711 --> 00:24:46.156]  And of course it turned out the whole thing was a big Pentagon PR lie so that they can basically
[00:24:46.596 --> 00:24:56.202]  In the future, have a national draft that the federal government's been promoting to then conscript our daughters in to basically be camp women for the military.
[00:24:56.582 --> 00:25:00.764]  And of course, rape is just epidemic when you put women in combat.
[00:25:01.345 --> 00:25:06.628]  Every culture, in every war, the soldiers get out of control and tend to rape.
[00:25:07.348 --> 00:25:09.189]  The women of the countries they're occupying.
[00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.791]  It's just what happens.
[00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:14.893]  I have to say that the British marveled in the Revolutionary War.
[00:25:15.753 --> 00:25:21.557]  Almost all of George Washington's soldiers never engaged in any types of disreputable activity.
[00:25:21.837 --> 00:25:22.418]  And you know why?
[00:25:22.438 --> 00:25:24.179]  Because George Washington hung people.
[00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:32.124]  See, the minute a military lets their troops engage in any type of activity like this, everything goes to the devil.
[00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.432]  Everything just goes completely wild.
[00:25:34.993 --> 00:25:38.077]  Once you give in to this type of activity, society collapses.
[00:25:38.598 --> 00:25:42.624]  That's why George Washington executed people and made examples out of it.
[00:25:42.864 --> 00:25:45.988]  Oh, you did something disreputable?
[00:25:46.089 --> 00:25:46.770]  You're dead!
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:54.285]  Because George Washington understood and wrote about the fact that A, it was the moral thing to do, but B, that's how they're going to win the hearts and minds.
[00:25:54.826 --> 00:26:06.755]  It's not behaving like the Redcoats, who'd been burning and pillaging all over the world, and came to the United States, came to the colonies, and were burning down churches, raping women, engaging in all sorts of war crimes.
[00:26:07.196 --> 00:26:15.663]  That, of course, worked against them, and began to turn the population who were British subjects towards the rebellion that was only 3% of the population.
[00:26:16.263 --> 00:26:28.448]  That's why the globalists are going to stage false flag attacks in the future to be blamed on the Liberty Movement or try to provocateur people into doing things.
[00:26:28.908 --> 00:26:31.189]  Patriots never target civilian targets.
[00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.991]  Patriots never start a fight.
[00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:36.252]  You understand that?
[00:26:37.152 --> 00:26:38.633]  Patriots give quarter.
[00:26:39.953 --> 00:26:41.534]  Patriots don't lie.
[00:26:42.631 --> 00:26:43.931]  And patriots have courage.
[00:26:44.432 --> 00:26:45.412]  That's what patriots do.
[00:26:45.452 --> 00:26:49.953]  They're patriots to basic liberty and basic freedom.
[00:26:50.353 --> 00:27:04.077]  Now, if you go to InfoWars.com, we have the headline, our top story, award-winning filmmaker and, of course, TV star, movie star, former head of the Screen Actors Guild.
[00:27:06.698 --> 00:27:18.123]  Ed Asner has come out and said that he has Navy SEAL sources, and those sources are known to yours truly, and I'm going to try to talk to some of them today.
[00:27:18.143 --> 00:27:30.088]  They've been told by active duty SEALs that the staged terror attack event is on, and that the events would be staged very, very soon internationally and domestically, but mainly in the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:37.534]  As a pretext to launch a wider war, obviously against Iran.
[00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:50.165]  Now, Mr. Clapper, the head of the National Security Council, the head advisor, has come out and said we should have provocations in the Brookings Institute papers, like the general public doesn't read that.
[00:27:50.946 --> 00:27:55.490]  Gary Hart's written letters about staging false flag terror attacks and warning Iran
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:03.062]  We have all this other news unfolding on this subject, and it's perfect timing.
[00:28:03.082 --> 00:28:19.086]  We also have Dick Cheney, who Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Cy Hirsch exposed four years ago, was planning to, and was ordering the SEALs to paint up their own boats like Iranian blue patrol boats, missile boats, to attack a U.S.
[00:28:19.126 --> 00:28:19.606]  destroyer.
[00:28:21.287 --> 00:28:24.548]  And, uh, Admiral Fallon got word of this.
[00:28:24.568 --> 00:28:25.808]  It actually happened five years ago.
[00:28:25.828 --> 00:28:29.289]  We learned of it three and a half years ago as soon as Cheney left office.
[00:28:29.649 --> 00:28:36.311]  Hirsch was ready to talk about it for his safety and had White House sources, and it was later confirmed he's a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner.
[00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:39.932]  But the issue here is, is that this is in the cards.
[00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:50.777]  And it's a very, very credible, real, specific threat that criminal elements running our government, the Israeli government, and NATO are set to stage these, and Navy SEALs are warning people.
[00:28:51.557 --> 00:28:55.039]  And of course it's the Navy SEALs doing it, because they were the ones told
[00:28:55.859 --> 00:29:05.821]  To do this attack and prepare it, and Fox Fallon, the head of CENTCOM, flipped out and said, I'm not going to do this, and went public and said, we're not attacking Iran on my watch.
[00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:07.341]  We're pulling the ships back.
[00:29:07.702 --> 00:29:10.882]  We're not going to have a straight-a-hormoose conflict like some people want.
[00:29:11.562 --> 00:29:13.363]  And, of course, he got removed.
[00:29:14.603 --> 00:29:23.265]  Admiral Mullen, two years ago, who was then Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, went to Israel and said, do not stage a USS Liberty.
[00:29:24.147 --> 00:29:25.488]  That was even in the Washington Post!
[00:29:26.589 --> 00:29:27.670]  I mean, this is serious.
[00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:28.371]  This is real.
[00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:33.235]  And so it's Fox Fallon, it's Admiral Mullen, now it's Navy SEALs.
[00:29:33.575 --> 00:29:35.236]  I know one of their names.
[00:29:35.457 --> 00:29:36.097]  Got their number.
[00:29:37.018 --> 00:29:38.219]  I'm gonna contact them today.
[00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:44.364]  Got it yesterday from Ed Asner, but that article and video is up at InfoWars.com.
[00:29:44.804 --> 00:29:48.047]  Coming up, TSA forces woman to use naked body scanner three times.
[00:29:48.067 --> 00:29:48.808]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.308 --> 00:29:50.829]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:54.662]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.124 --> 00:30:04.546]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:05.787 --> 00:30:10.549]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:17.692]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:19.656 --> 00:30:26.030]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:30:28.135 --> 00:30:32.037]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:30:32.718 --> 00:30:35.819]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.400]  Others don't.
[00:30:37.801 --> 00:30:39.682]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:39.942 --> 00:30:41.443]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:41.723 --> 00:30:44.284]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:44.604 --> 00:30:50.868]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:30:51.248 --> 00:30:53.449]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.971]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:30:56.311 --> 00:30:56.811]  Others don't.
[00:30:58.436 --> 00:31:05.419]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:31:05.659 --> 00:31:23.285]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:31:23.545 --> 00:31:27.647]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:31:27.927 --> 00:31:29.508]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:31:29.708 --> 00:31:37.553]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:31:37.874 --> 00:31:44.118]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:31:44.178 --> 00:31:45.219]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:31:45.459 --> 00:31:46.199]  It's incredible.
[00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:55.365]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:31:55.545 --> 00:31:57.387]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:58.167 --> 00:32:02.410]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:03.331]  Number one.
[00:32:03.631 --> 00:32:06.793]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:07.073 --> 00:32:07.634]  Number two.
[00:32:07.934 --> 00:32:12.477]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:12.817 --> 00:32:13.258]  It's true.
[00:32:13.558 --> 00:32:18.121]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:18.441 --> 00:32:18.982]  Number three.
[00:32:19.262 --> 00:32:22.544]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:22.844 --> 00:32:26.527]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:26.747 --> 00:32:27.288]  Number 4.
[00:32:27.548 --> 00:32:29.910]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:33.694]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:33.995 --> 00:32:34.515]  Number 5.
[00:32:34.775 --> 00:32:38.700]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.685]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:43.965 --> 00:32:47.988]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:48.128 --> 00:32:49.689]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.011]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:54.533]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:22.188 --> 00:33:23.408]  We are back live.
[00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:25.589]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:31.431]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:31.451 --> 00:33:32.031]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:32.071 --> 00:33:32.451]  Central.
[00:33:32.471 --> 00:33:33.671]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:34.091]  Eastern.
[00:33:36.212 --> 00:33:43.134]  And we got Max Keiser coming up in the third hour for a full hour to take your phone calls on the economy and more.
[00:33:44.094 --> 00:33:47.295]  And we have Adam Kokesh popping in and dealing with Ron Paul.
[00:33:48.266 --> 00:33:58.078]  And the amazing job he's doing, getting 70 plus percent of military donations, compared to all other candidates, not just Republican, but also to Obama.
[00:33:58.698 --> 00:34:04.706]  The troops, because they're in on what's really going on, more than the general public, know Ron Paul's the way to go.
[00:34:06.189 --> 00:34:12.131]  I love how the corporate prostitute Decepticon media is always acting like the troops want us to stay in war.
[00:34:12.792 --> 00:34:15.633]  You know, for the troops, let's stay in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:34:16.013 --> 00:34:19.054]  For the troops, let's keep bases in 160 plus countries.
[00:34:20.274 --> 00:34:28.118]  And then you pull the troops, the vast majority want to cut back the size of the military, want to get out of a bunch of countries and want to come home.
[00:34:29.118 --> 00:34:33.880]  Now, are there people who believe the propaganda that America is really under threat and who want to fight for this country?
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.140]  Yes.
[00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:37.904]  Are there guys just flat out addicted to combat?
[00:34:38.928 --> 00:34:39.631]  Oh, certainly.
[00:34:41.607 --> 00:34:52.953]  But the majority of them are amazing professionals who love this country and know that Ron Paul, who's a veteran himself, is trying to uphold our Republic and the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:58.836]  In fact, there's an ad with an Air Force commander that Ron Paul's been running that we played on the nightly news last night.
[00:34:59.196 --> 00:35:00.117]  Darren McBrain's got it.
[00:35:00.137 --> 00:35:05.900]  Will you guys get that so that when Kokesh, a veteran of the Marine Corps in Iraq himself, joins us, we can
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.402]  We can play that because I really think it puts it in perspective.
[00:35:10.422 --> 00:35:13.604]  And there's a graph that shows, I think in that graph it's 73%.
[00:35:14.985 --> 00:35:22.349]  I've seen the numbers 71, 73, 74, depending on what mainstream news article you look at from the Federal Elections Commission, it varies.
[00:35:22.389 --> 00:35:28.053]  But over 70% of military support, Ron Paul.
[00:35:28.353 --> 00:35:29.594]  What does that tell you?
[00:35:29.634 --> 00:35:36.258]  See, they can steal elections at the county, state, and federal level in many areas.
[00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:40.341]  It's not total fraud, but they're able to manipulate and twist things.
[00:35:40.561 --> 00:35:41.822]  They've been caught over and over again.
[00:35:42.363 --> 00:35:44.805]  Ron Paul's pointing out the obvious because he has to.
[00:35:44.865 --> 00:35:45.545]  It's reality.
[00:35:46.946 --> 00:35:47.967]  He really did win Maine.
[00:35:48.307 --> 00:35:51.209]  The anomalies are just like they were in other states he won but got cheated.
[00:35:54.172 --> 00:36:00.797]  But you see, they can't cheat the small individual donations because those get reported.
[00:36:01.858 --> 00:36:06.181]  And so he gets three to one more small donations than any other candidate.
[00:36:06.241 --> 00:36:07.362]  Same thing four years ago.
[00:36:08.564 --> 00:36:14.586]  He gets more than three to one all the other candidates from the military.
[00:36:16.167 --> 00:36:25.950]  Just like you can't cover up, he has more signs, he has more bumper stickers, he wins all the online polls, he wins all the major straw polls, all the things they can't rig, he wins.
[00:36:28.591 --> 00:36:35.974]  And he's doubled or more than doubled all of his major vote tallies
[00:36:37.699 --> 00:36:46.007]  Except for Nevada, where he statistically got the exact number of votes and delegates in Nevada that he got four years ago.
[00:36:46.447 --> 00:36:57.978]  Now, does anybody believe that in some states he got 100%, others 200%, others 90% increase, but then, four years later, he gets the exact same thing in Nevada?
[00:36:58.399 --> 00:36:59.039]  The fix was in.
[00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:02.102]  They didn't even bother to upgrade the computer fraud algorithm.
[00:37:02.783 --> 00:37:02.983]  Okay.
[00:37:04.517 --> 00:37:15.384]  Let me get a few more news articles and then what I'm going to do is go to some of your phone calls ahead of Kokesh on any of the issues I've raised.
[00:37:15.484 --> 00:37:16.224]  I want to hear from you.
[00:37:16.404 --> 00:37:18.926]  Quick comments so we can get to some people and move on.
[00:37:18.946 --> 00:37:18.986]  800-259-9231.
[00:37:19.006 --> 00:37:19.646]  800-259-9231.
[00:37:19.686 --> 00:37:20.187]  First-time callers.
[00:37:20.207 --> 00:37:21.888]  Let me add that caveat.
[00:37:21.948 --> 00:37:22.648]  First-time callers right now.
[00:37:22.668 --> 00:37:22.708]  800-259-9231.
[00:37:34.895 --> 00:37:38.719]  Now here's some of the other news I'm going to get to more after Adam Kokesh pops in for 20 minutes.
[00:37:39.519 --> 00:37:43.363]  Female passengers say they're targeted by TSA.
[00:37:44.083 --> 00:37:45.545]  CBF, DFW.
[00:37:46.772 --> 00:37:51.175]  And of course, Paul Watson did his more detailed article that's linked on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:37:51.495 --> 00:37:53.396]  It's also the top story at InfoWars.com.
[00:37:53.976 --> 00:38:01.641]  TSA forces woman to use naked body scanner three times because of cute figure and told her that.
[00:38:02.121 --> 00:38:06.504]  Now, remember a few years ago at another Texas airport, what was it?
[00:38:08.025 --> 00:38:08.545]  Amarillo?
[00:38:08.565 --> 00:38:10.646]  You can pull it up.
[00:38:10.687 --> 00:38:12.047]  Was it Amarillo or Midland?
[00:38:12.127 --> 00:38:12.868]  I'm going from memory.
[00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:21.844]  They came over, made her pull her shirt off, and three men commented on how attractive her mammary glands were.
[00:38:23.965 --> 00:38:27.747]  I guess those haven't been outlawed, like Amish showing, well, I'm on a side issue.
[00:38:28.027 --> 00:38:32.310]  The point is, is they'll try to outlaw that too, just being a mother, they're demonizing breastfeeding.
[00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.171]  I'm being serious, that wasn't attempted humor.
[00:38:34.991 --> 00:38:43.196]  The point is, they all come over, they get in their face, tell her she's gorgeous, she's crying, and a supervisor comes over and tries to give her his number.
[00:38:44.554 --> 00:38:46.156]  Like, baby, you are looking good.
[00:38:46.216 --> 00:38:46.816]  Here's my number.
[00:38:47.277 --> 00:38:48.598]  They're that detached.
[00:38:48.839 --> 00:38:51.081]  I mean, they're ripping colostomy bags off old people.
[00:38:51.261 --> 00:38:55.606]  They're making 95-year-old women that can't walk be picked up by people out of their wheelchairs.
[00:38:55.706 --> 00:38:57.388]  It's total prisoner training.
[00:38:58.789 --> 00:39:02.933]  Zero tolerance, mindlessness, training you to submit to total tyranny.
[00:39:05.256 --> 00:39:06.978]  Now, continuing here,
[00:39:13.137 --> 00:39:21.558]  TSA forces woman to use naked body scanner three times because of cute figure.
[00:39:22.019 --> 00:39:31.020]  Now remember, they denied the whole breast thing in Texas until she filed suit and got the video and then they settled with her.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:41.402]  They denied Miss USA until they got the video and had to admit they went in her underwear and into her body.
[00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:44.823]  I mean, I've been there at the airport and seen when they check to see what it is.
[00:39:45.924 --> 00:39:48.687]  I've got an ABC News headline that I can't even say on the air.
[00:39:49.768 --> 00:39:54.912]  TSA, twisting bleeps, taking off clothes.
[00:39:56.053 --> 00:39:58.095]  They actually squeeze to check.
[00:39:58.435 --> 00:40:01.358]  I mean, Ron Paul has pointed out on this show, it's painful.
[00:40:01.758 --> 00:40:02.759]  He's a medical doctor.
[00:40:02.779 --> 00:40:04.240]  He calls it disgusting and painful.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:08.064]  I mean, you've got to be a medical doctor to know how to squeeze on men.
[00:40:10.626 --> 00:40:11.747]  To know what to do with women.
[00:40:11.787 --> 00:40:13.708]  I mean, this is a medical exam.
[00:40:14.429 --> 00:40:16.551]  That's why they have specialists when the police arrest you.
[00:40:17.091 --> 00:40:18.652]  That, you know, come in and do things like that.
[00:40:21.114 --> 00:40:26.058]  You are in a custodial arrest, and they're doing this to your family, your children, training them to be abused.
[00:40:27.159 --> 00:40:31.603]  And my point here is, they're going to end up trying to deny this, like they always do.
[00:40:32.223 --> 00:40:35.186]  They denied Miss USA.
[00:40:36.653 --> 00:40:37.433]  Turned out it was true.
[00:40:37.773 --> 00:40:41.875]  They denied they were stripping all those old ladies at JFK.
[00:40:42.175 --> 00:40:44.956]  Later had to apologize and admit they're doing it, but they're going to keep doing it.
[00:40:45.936 --> 00:40:51.037]  They lied about taking the woman's shirt off and commenting on her breast and hitting on her.
[00:40:51.257 --> 00:40:51.998]  They had to settle.
[00:40:53.218 --> 00:40:59.180]  They're out of their minds crazy because the government can only hire lunatics to do something that nobody else would do.
[00:41:01.485 --> 00:41:07.029]  So TSA forced this woman to use a naked body scanner three times because they said she had a cute figure.
[00:41:08.029 --> 00:41:13.833]  Remember in England they used naked body scanners on different TV stars and tried to deny it.
[00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:31.075]  TSA, again, forces women to use naked body scanner three times because of cute figure.
[00:41:31.095 --> 00:41:33.577]  Again, I just keep repeating this headline here.
[00:41:34.338 --> 00:41:41.183]  New legislation will force TSA to install passenger advocates at every airport.
[00:41:41.444 --> 00:41:48.969]  That's kind of like you can go to the warden if you don't like what's happening, or you don't like getting your leg blown off, you can go to an army counselor.
[00:41:49.775 --> 00:41:51.257]  This is putting perfume on a pig.
[00:41:51.918 --> 00:42:05.573]  And it's the CBS News report out of Dallas with these women talking about how when they see a hottie, a good looking woman, and of course when they see little girls especially, a lot of these guys are pedophiles, they run them in there.
[00:42:06.704 --> 00:42:12.452]  And they scan them over and over again and make a big joke out of it, and then on top of it do the physical search.
[00:42:13.053 --> 00:42:15.877]  Is there nothing the American people won't take?
[00:42:16.317 --> 00:42:21.724]  And I've had members of the state legislature on that introduced the bills, remember in Texas, to try to stop this?
[00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:28.987]  And describing their children and wives being groped, the family crying, the TSA laughing.
[00:42:29.528 --> 00:42:31.068]  And you know what Austin did?
[00:42:31.789 --> 00:42:37.072]  They now have responded by groping everyone and body scanning everyone that flies out of Bergstrom.
[00:42:38.313 --> 00:42:42.615]  And I've had members of the Statehouse on who believe they're being singled out now.
[00:42:43.076 --> 00:42:44.556]  When they go through, look out.
[00:42:44.636 --> 00:42:46.217]  They get out the walnut crushers.
[00:42:46.778 --> 00:42:52.121]  I mean, this is all about total and complete domination over the population.
[00:42:54.798 --> 00:42:56.880]  Again, female passengers say they're targeted.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.403]  Of course, the TSA says that's not true, that they randomly select people.
[00:43:01.884 --> 00:43:02.344]  That's bull.
[00:43:02.744 --> 00:43:05.527]  They decide when they want to check your car to put you through.
[00:43:05.547 --> 00:43:06.547]  But I fly a lot.
[00:43:07.028 --> 00:43:09.710]  Not as much as I used to, but I fly to cover media events.
[00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.072]  And I see them pull out the good-looking women.
[00:43:13.473 --> 00:43:15.374]  Eric Muller, Mancow Muller, talks about it.
[00:43:15.414 --> 00:43:16.255]  His wife's good-looking.
[00:43:16.675 --> 00:43:18.237]  Every time the groping begins.
[00:43:18.977 --> 00:43:20.318]  It is a sick joke.
[00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:26.920]  TSA people have been caught raping women in the parking lot, molesting children, hitting on women.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.661]  It's constant.
[00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:31.622]  Putting notes in their bags, how they want to have sex with them.
[00:43:32.322 --> 00:43:33.462]  The list goes on and on.
[00:43:33.522 --> 00:43:37.864]  This is a nightmare of federal brown shirts now expanding on the streets.
[00:43:38.404 --> 00:43:40.505]  I'm going to play that clip coming up later.
[00:43:41.983 --> 00:43:46.307]  And I'm also going to play a clip of this coming up later after we take calls and talk to Adam Kokesh.
[00:43:46.848 --> 00:43:53.114]  Obama's CFR economic council director calls for global tax on C-SPAN.
[00:43:54.395 --> 00:43:55.957]  The head of his economic council,
[00:43:57.335 --> 00:44:00.256]  The folks shutting down other power plants but letting GE operate.
[00:44:00.996 --> 00:44:04.917]  They are saying, on C-SPAN, we need a global tax.
[00:44:05.657 --> 00:44:08.737]  Now, you've already got it through the IMF and World Bank, but our governments pay them.
[00:44:09.217 --> 00:44:11.358]  Now they're announcing the global airline tax.
[00:44:12.098 --> 00:44:13.598]  Then the global automobile tax.
[00:44:13.678 --> 00:44:14.959]  Then the other carbon taxes.
[00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.639]  All to be paid to private banks.
[00:44:17.699 --> 00:44:18.299]  That's admitted.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.960]  They're skipping even paying the UN the money.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.921]  They're going right to paying the big global megabanks.
[00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:27.992]  And it's not just our article.
[00:44:28.714 --> 00:44:30.578]  Weekly Standard picked it up as well.
[00:44:30.899 --> 00:44:32.162]  White House Economic Advisor.
[00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:33.786]  We need a global minimum tax.
[00:44:34.287 --> 00:44:36.272]  And that's what the OECD calls for.
[00:44:37.734 --> 00:44:45.299]  And the Ex-Im Bank and the International Bank of Settlements, they all call for global tax standardization and a global tax.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.681]  What did Ban Ki-moon call for a week and a half ago?
[00:44:48.342 --> 00:44:50.263]  World government and world tax.
[00:44:51.204 --> 00:44:52.164]  Simultaneously.
[00:44:52.184 --> 00:45:02.772]  ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, fired reports out to police and publicly that day, saying it doesn't exist, report anyone talking about it.
[00:45:03.757 --> 00:45:08.466]  In the New York Times, in the Desert News, in the Associated Press, all happening.
[00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:10.751]  Boom!
[00:45:10.951 --> 00:45:12.253]  Police doesn't exist.
[00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:17.330]  I mean, that's the type of brainwashing we're dealing with.
[00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:18.191]  So that's coming up.
[00:45:18.211 --> 00:45:22.994]  I also want to go over 20 things we can learn about the future of the American dream from the death of Detroit.
[00:45:23.354 --> 00:45:24.575]  I absolutely agree with this article.
[00:45:24.615 --> 00:45:27.638]  It's up at InfoWars.com from the Economic Collapse blog.
[00:45:28.378 --> 00:45:34.222]  We've also got Moody's Investors Service downgrading Europe big time.
[00:45:34.242 --> 00:45:35.123]  That's all part of the plan.
[00:45:35.143 --> 00:45:36.104]  We told you that was coming.
[00:45:37.392 --> 00:45:40.434]  Again, these countries are bankrupt because they're under banker management.
[00:45:40.695 --> 00:45:45.638]  Then the bankers own rating agencies that AAA rate their derivatives crud to sell the governments.
[00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:58.208]  Now the governments have signed on to their debt, and then the bankers' rating agency downgrades the countries to put them into hock to the very banks that the countries are in hock to because they bailed out the bankers.
[00:45:59.689 --> 00:46:02.271]  It's so simple and over the top it's hard to even grasp, isn't it?
[00:46:02.691 --> 00:46:04.073]  We give the bankers our money.
[00:46:04.373 --> 00:46:05.534]  Then we're in debt to them.
[00:46:05.574 --> 00:46:06.955]  They loan it back to us in interest.
[00:46:08.106 --> 00:46:09.767]  And then downgrade our sovereignty.
[00:46:10.788 --> 00:46:16.793]  To them, to establish a world government we pay taxes to, and they're publicly announcing it everywhere.
[00:46:17.733 --> 00:46:21.156]  The Economist magazine, Reuters, Associated Press, every day.
[00:46:21.176 --> 00:46:22.997]  Global government's the answer.
[00:46:23.017 --> 00:46:24.459]  Global tax is the answer.
[00:46:24.719 --> 00:46:31.104]  But simultaneously, the White House-run Media Matters, on record, is saying I'm deadly dangerous.
[00:46:31.892 --> 00:46:34.813]  And they've got national news asking, should I be arrested?
[00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:39.675]  And the White House regulations are saying, start arresting people like Alex Jones.
[00:46:40.115 --> 00:46:44.517]  Because I will sit here with clear understanding that two plus two equals four.
[00:46:44.977 --> 00:46:46.998]  I'm like the three-year-old in the Emperor's New Clothes.
[00:46:47.478 --> 00:46:50.519]  The Emperor's butt naked in the street at a parade.
[00:46:50.599 --> 00:46:54.241]  Nobody wants to tell him he's been conned by the... Guys, will you guys print me?
[00:46:55.305 --> 00:46:59.051]  The Parable of the Emperor's New Clothes, a synopsis of it.
[00:46:59.813 --> 00:47:01.275]  I need to tell that story today.
[00:47:01.876 --> 00:47:04.981]  I want to go to calls, but I need to tell that story today.
[00:47:07.014 --> 00:47:09.716]  Because con artists come to town briefly.
[00:47:10.096 --> 00:47:11.357]  I'll read the whole thing later if I have time.
[00:47:11.677 --> 00:47:19.482]  Con artists come to town and they say, this is such a beautiful weaving of gold we're going to do that only royalty can see its pure beauty.
[00:47:19.802 --> 00:47:21.863]  The profane cannot see it.
[00:47:22.263 --> 00:47:23.384]  So they say, here's your cloak.
[00:47:23.704 --> 00:47:24.525]  Well, he can't see it.
[00:47:24.565 --> 00:47:26.346]  He doesn't want to say he's not high class.
[00:47:26.606 --> 00:47:27.447]  He's not trendy.
[00:47:27.667 --> 00:47:28.988]  This is what trendiness is all about.
[00:47:29.728 --> 00:47:31.512]  Okay, that's why I make jokes about trendiness, you know.
[00:47:32.053 --> 00:47:38.907]  And so he starts wearing it, and he marches in front of everyone, everybody knows he's naked, but nobody wants to say he's naked because they'll be arrested.
[00:47:39.588 --> 00:47:40.089]  Or laughed at.
[00:47:41.502 --> 00:47:47.045]  And finally, they're selling more and more expensive cloaks, you know, for hundreds of thousands of talons of gold and stuff.
[00:47:47.746 --> 00:47:52.228]  And finally, a three-year-old steps forward and says the emperor is naked, and everybody else starts laughing.
[00:47:52.489 --> 00:47:52.649]  Okay?
[00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:53.769]  I mean, I'm not smart.
[00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:59.433]  I'm here going, here they are, world government, poisoning our food and water, publicly, the emperor's butt naked.
[00:48:01.124 --> 00:48:02.085]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[00:48:02.986 --> 00:48:03.667]  It's all coming up.
[00:48:04.188 --> 00:48:05.649]  War with Syria, openly.
[00:48:05.689 --> 00:48:06.811]  Hillary out of control.
[00:48:06.931 --> 00:48:08.973]  I mean, I'm living in the twilight zone here.
[00:48:09.273 --> 00:48:10.935]  AB in Ohio, thanks for holding.
[00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:11.256]  Welcome.
[00:48:12.884 --> 00:48:14.905]  Hey, Alex, this is Abe.
[00:48:15.045 --> 00:48:18.507]  I'm an OU student senior at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio.
[00:48:19.168 --> 00:48:23.470]  I'm also a candidate for my local government here in Athens County.
[00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:27.893]  I'm running for Athens County Treasurer, but I have three things I want to talk to you about, Alex, so I'll make them quick.
[00:48:27.933 --> 00:48:29.074]  I know you're in a rush.
[00:48:29.514 --> 00:48:33.056]  The first thing is about my local county sheriff here in Athens.
[00:48:33.336 --> 00:48:36.818]  He's a former Blackwater agent.
[00:48:36.838 --> 00:48:39.100]  He went out and trained in between re-elections.
[00:48:39.921 --> 00:49:00.200]  Uh, some Blackwater troops in Iraq, and he's, uh, now trying to move our auditor, our local auditor's raising, uh, some heck about it, how he wants to move $200,000, him and the local prosecutor, or him and the, uh, county prosecutor, outside of her scope of oversight into a private bank account, which I think is just complete fraud, and who knows what could happen with that.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.601]  And it really worries me.
[00:49:02.161 --> 00:49:05.584]  Well, sir, that's standard with county and city governments.
[00:49:05.904 --> 00:49:07.846]  They always have their little secret budgets.
[00:49:08.727 --> 00:49:11.209]  But, I mean, particularly, where are you located?
[00:49:11.249 --> 00:49:11.789]  What's happening?
[00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:17.434]  Well, Athens County, Ohio, southeastern Ohio, right close to the West Virginia border.
[00:49:18.275 --> 00:49:19.596]  But it's happening.
[00:49:19.636 --> 00:49:23.959]  He got a Department of Homeland Security grant for a mobile command center.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.143]  It is a massive, looks like a box truck that can
[00:49:28.903 --> 00:49:32.004]  Well, listen, you know what the feds say on record.
[00:49:32.024 --> 00:49:36.264]  If you get involved in your government and criticize them being taken over by the feds, you're the terrorist.
[00:49:36.284 --> 00:49:37.605]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:49:37.665 --> 00:49:40.725]  And so it just gives license to all these... I mean, there are police forces of five cops.
[00:49:57.128 --> 00:50:04.986]  Where they're buying machine guns, getting armored vehicles from the army, going under federal training, spying on old Billy Bob at the coffee shop.
[00:50:05.914 --> 00:50:22.288]  I mean I was watching this morning a TSA airport video where a woman didn't want to be patted down and they call like eight cops and the cops are hyperventilating and all have their arms behind their backs and like and you know running around like they've caught Al Qaeda with a woman and her kids.
[00:50:22.748 --> 00:50:30.195]  I mean it's just it's it's like a bunch of paranoid crazy government people telling us we're crazy because we don't like their crazy evil.
[00:50:31.884 --> 00:50:33.386]  And I have one more thing.
[00:50:33.406 --> 00:50:35.367]  This is a little bit about Poisoning the Water.
[00:50:35.707 --> 00:50:40.291]  Me and about six other friends have been going to the Athens City Council meeting.
[00:50:40.351 --> 00:50:40.712]  Stay there.
[00:50:40.772 --> 00:50:41.892]  I want to hear about it on the other side.
[00:50:41.913 --> 00:50:43.494]  And then we'll get Abe.
[00:50:43.514 --> 00:50:44.675]  Then we'll get to Jacob.
[00:50:44.695 --> 00:50:48.358]  We'll get to Nicholas, Dylan, Brian.
[00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:56.785]  And then at 8 after for two segments, we got Adam Kokesh organizing a veterans march that's going to be very effective if it gets media attention for Ron Paul and Max Kaiser.
[00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.789]  Attention!
[00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.893]  Information in this one-minute message could save your life.
[00:51:03.153 --> 00:51:04.955]  Don't wait for the next emergency to happen.
[00:51:05.255 --> 00:51:06.736]  Act now to be prepared.
[00:51:07.017 --> 00:51:15.125]  Now, more than ever, civilians and communities must communicate with family, friends, and neighbors in the event of civil unrest, natural disasters, or other emergencies.
[00:51:15.325 --> 00:51:17.547]  That's why there's CivilDispatch.com.

[00:52:08.701 --> 00:52:13.263]  They decide what devices you receive, when you get replacement equipment, and even what you pay.
[00:52:13.583 --> 00:52:15.244]  Why limit the quality of your treatment?
[00:52:15.564 --> 00:52:20.306]  Break away from institutionalized health care and shop where you set the sleep therapy standard.

[00:54:25.563 --> 00:54:31.006]  We're going to go back to Abe listening on 770 AM WAIS in Ohio.
[00:54:31.146 --> 00:54:32.166]  Great affiliate out there.
[00:54:32.987 --> 00:54:34.228]  And then others here in a moment.
[00:54:35.488 --> 00:54:44.873]  But I do want to plug that we've sold, I don't know, like 65, 70% of the tickets for the event coming up in a week and a half in Orlando the 26th of February.
[00:54:44.893 --> 00:54:53.958]  I'm going to premiere a short documentary titled, well I'm not going to tell you the title of it, it's going to be a surprise, but my speech is titled Blueprint to Defeat the New World Order.
[00:54:55.163 --> 00:54:56.926]  There's going to be some surprises as well.
[00:54:57.788 --> 00:55:00.292]  One of the surprises I can tell you about at the Dallas event...
[00:55:01.195 --> 00:55:08.760]  And there's still about 40% of the tickets left for that, but that usually happens, then it sells out a few days before or on the day.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:18.567]  So if you want to come, I want to see you there this Sunday, the 19th of February at the Lakewood Theater, 1825 Abrams Parkway, Dallas, Texas.
[00:55:19.087 --> 00:55:25.251]  And if you want to call and get tickets, it's 214-821-7469 or lakewoodtheater.com.
[00:55:25.271 --> 00:55:30.695]  You can find it there in their calendar of events, or just go to infowars.com forward slash events.
[00:55:31.355 --> 00:55:36.157]  And there's also the event we're doing there in Orlando on the 26th.
[00:55:36.477 --> 00:55:40.078]  You can find that at InfoWars.com forward slash events.
[00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:41.859]  Jim Mars.
[00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:43.780]  Richard Reeves is going up there with me.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.861]  He said, you know, you had Jim there five years ago when you last spoke in Dallas.
[00:55:47.987 --> 00:55:51.728]  When you premiered Terror Storm, you ought to have Jim speak again.
[00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:54.089]  So Jim is going to speak first.
[00:55:54.529 --> 00:56:01.551]  He's going to be on the radio with me that day, the Sunday show, right before I go out and give my speech and premiere this surprise film.
[00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:03.352]  And it is a surprise.
[00:56:05.072 --> 00:56:08.634]  But Jim Marr is going to be there and speak for about 30 minutes and introduce me.
[00:56:09.014 --> 00:56:10.674]  So he'll be there as well.
[00:56:11.375 --> 00:56:15.196]  That is coming up this Sunday in Dallas.
[00:56:15.236 --> 00:56:16.037]  Hope to see you there.
[00:56:16.097 --> 00:56:19.658]  Infowars.com forward slash events.
[00:56:20.258 --> 00:56:23.400]  Okay, let's go back to Abe in Ohio, listening on 770 AM WAIS.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:28.422]  Abe, go ahead and make your point about the poison fluoride in the water.
[00:56:29.282 --> 00:56:33.344]  Yeah, well, I've been going to our local city council meeting here in Athens City, Ohio.
[00:56:34.254 --> 00:56:41.719]  And I've been going off and on for about four years since I was a senior in high school, and now I'm a senior at OU here in Athens.
[00:56:41.739 --> 00:56:43.860]  And there's some people in the movement.
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:57:00.070]  And since the beginning of the year, we had a new council, so me and my friends and some other just concerned citizens went to meetings, every meeting since the beginning of the year, and just let them have 35 to 40 minutes every meeting at the end of the meeting for Citizen Out to speak.
[00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:02.245]  And we've just been giving it to him.
[00:57:02.265 --> 00:57:15.463]  Well, at the last meeting, the law director feels the need to give us a 15 minute lecture at the beginning of the meeting saying that there's an EPA mandate and how City Hall or the City Council cannot do anything because it's a
[00:57:17.624 --> 00:57:23.268]  Yeah, and again, a mandate means the feds say you need to do it.
[00:57:23.389 --> 00:57:29.173]  And then what you bring up is 90 plus percent of the EPA's own scientists have gone public saying it's deadly.
[00:57:29.653 --> 00:57:31.454]  They're pulling it out all over the world.
[00:57:31.875 --> 00:57:36.298]  So he basically sits up there and lies to people and just implies it's a federal or state law.
[00:57:36.926 --> 00:57:37.887]  Totally agree!
[00:57:38.187 --> 00:57:48.653]  And the problem is, Athens, the city, voted it down twice in the 60s, and then through a referendum after the state legislator passed this mandate, had a chance to opt out of it in 1970 through a loophole, and they did.
[00:57:48.994 --> 00:57:54.577]  But in 1989, on a lame duck council, on a 4-3 vote, it got voted into the water.
[00:57:54.857 --> 00:58:01.041]  And I've even talked to the head water director at the city water plant, and she's opposed to it, but I mean, she's
[00:58:01.876 --> 00:58:02.516]  Yeah, sue them.
[00:58:02.697 --> 00:58:03.017]  Sue them.
[00:58:03.037 --> 00:58:04.137]  They're assaulting you.
[00:58:04.658 --> 00:58:13.082]  As soon as it gets into court that there's hundreds of chemicals in the so-called fluoride, because they'll argue fluoride's good for you even though it kills you deader than a hammer over time.
[00:58:13.822 --> 00:58:14.883]  Just point out that
[00:58:16.522 --> 00:58:20.544]  You start doing the interrogatives, the requests for the exact mix they've got.
[00:58:20.584 --> 00:58:22.005]  It's all got a bunch of poison in it.
[00:58:22.485 --> 00:58:25.527]  They're going to pull it out real quick and move on to others they want to brain damage.
[00:58:26.127 --> 00:58:31.050]  And see what they do is, they make your town pay for the toxic waste.
[00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:34.732]  You're paying them to have them brain damage you and your family.
[00:58:35.232 --> 00:58:35.813]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:41.236 --> 00:58:45.198]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:49.653 --> 00:58:51.175]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.375 --> 00:58:56.421]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:56.701 --> 00:58:58.063]  Saving means to make money.
[00:58:58.223 --> 00:59:07.013]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:07.754 --> 00:59:14.859]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:15.279 --> 00:59:22.904]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:23.284 --> 00:59:28.207]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:59:51.479 --> 00:59:53.400]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:56.622]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:03.274 --> 01:00:07.476]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:08.117 --> 01:00:08.917]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.697 --> 01:00:10.598]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.258 --> 01:00:14.860]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.503]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:30.612]  Alright, we're going to continue to take your calls and after Adam Kokesh leaves us here at the bottom of the hour, I'll continue with calls.
[01:00:31.473 --> 01:00:34.134]  And the open announcement of global government and global taxes.
[01:00:34.234 --> 01:00:38.016]  Obama's economic council head calling for it.
[01:00:38.076 --> 01:00:47.780]  Hillary is calling for peace troops to invade Syria like they invaded and dropped love bombs over Libya so Al-Qaeda could take control.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:49.601]  That's all coming up.
[01:00:50.501 --> 01:00:52.422]  But right now, let's go to Jacob at Indiana.
[01:00:53.447 --> 01:00:55.529]  And he's watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:56.550]  Jacob, welcome.
[01:00:58.051 --> 01:00:59.172]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:00:59.272 --> 01:00:59.672]  Good sir.
[01:01:00.673 --> 01:01:02.395]  I just wanted to bring up a few things.
[01:01:02.475 --> 01:01:12.063]  I'm a big Ron Paul supporter and actually we're starting a rally in Northwest Indiana in the Chicago area on the 25th I think.
[01:01:12.964 --> 01:01:17.408]  And I just wanted to bring up a point about that milk that you were talking about, the raw milk.
[01:01:18.171 --> 01:01:18.491]  Yes sir.
[01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:20.453]  And how bad regular milk is?
[01:01:21.273 --> 01:01:21.514]  Yes.
[01:01:21.634 --> 01:01:32.682]  I went on this diet where I didn't drink any milk for like a month and then I went off of it and I started drinking regular milk again and I couldn't believe how sick it was making me feel.
[01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:40.628]  Well I've had medical doctors on, I've had scientists on, I've had old-time farmers and dairy people on.
[01:01:41.328 --> 01:01:42.029]  So-called
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:54.947]  Homogenized milk, milk that has been cooked, is nothing but a trans-fat cheese that clogs your arteries.
[01:01:55.047 --> 01:01:55.808]  It is not milk.
[01:01:55.868 --> 01:02:04.033]  See, they ban real milk and then bring in their counterfeit and then call everybody extremists who want real milk while the elite are obsessed with real milk.
[01:02:04.613 --> 01:02:08.396]  That's the only reason they haven't shut down the few pockets of it is because the elite all drink it.
[01:02:09.778 --> 01:02:12.219]  And they know the Queen of England, all of them.
[01:02:12.319 --> 01:02:13.219]  Because it's milk.
[01:02:13.279 --> 01:02:14.219]  It's not raw milk.
[01:02:14.379 --> 01:02:15.139]  It's milk.
[01:02:15.739 --> 01:02:19.020]  And the stuff you're given is not milk.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.581]  It is pasteurized, homogenized, boiled garbage.
[01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:26.942]  Because they're feeding you feces and blood and pus.
[01:02:27.682 --> 01:02:29.522]  But you can't do that with real milk.
[01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:32.503]  If there's anything in it, you can't get away with it.
[01:02:33.123 --> 01:02:33.943]  I'm sorry, go ahead sir.
[01:02:34.804 --> 01:02:36.524]  Yeah, I just wanted to point that out.
[01:02:37.367 --> 01:02:37.527]  No, no.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.681]  There's no doubt Ron Paul is the winner.
[01:03:03.721 --> 01:03:04.702]  They're stealing it from him.
[01:03:05.302 --> 01:03:06.803]  And I didn't say this four years ago.
[01:03:06.903 --> 01:03:10.546]  I said there's some cheating going on in New Hampshire and other areas.
[01:03:11.126 --> 01:03:14.368]  You know, so he's in fourth place instead of second like he should be.
[01:03:14.788 --> 01:03:15.829]  But he's not the frontrunner.
[01:03:16.129 --> 01:03:17.970]  Ron Paul is now the frontrunner.
[01:03:18.351 --> 01:03:20.252]  We've done an analysis and they're stealing it from him.
[01:03:20.752 --> 01:03:21.673]  It's what the criminals do.
[01:03:23.015 --> 01:03:27.477]  They're known criminals that lie continually and have been caught in election fraud perpetually.
[01:03:27.797 --> 01:03:30.858]  We'd be idiots not to know they're doing it and all the evidence is there.
[01:03:31.238 --> 01:03:35.580]  Look at how they gamed the debates and gamed the coverage and told you he couldn't win.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.561]  And now they can't be proven wrong because you're not listening to them.
[01:03:39.581 --> 01:03:41.562]  Go ahead.
[01:03:41.582 --> 01:03:44.183]  Yeah, it's just all ridiculous.
[01:03:44.263 --> 01:03:52.106]  I just wanted to know if there's any films or anything that you have that would show a good thing about Ron Paul.
[01:03:52.794 --> 01:03:59.283]  Have you put together any films that would be like a click that you could show people that maybe necessarily don't know all about Ron Paul?
[01:04:00.902 --> 01:04:04.704]  Yeah, there's a video we're about to play coming out of break and the audio.
[01:04:05.704 --> 01:04:07.405]  There's a whole series of these ads.
[01:04:07.745 --> 01:04:09.506]  In fact, I'll get the titles of these ads.
[01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:12.287]  If you guys can get that off the Ron Paul website for me, that'd be awesome.
[01:04:13.108 --> 01:04:14.448]  And we'll give you the name of the ad.
[01:04:14.468 --> 01:04:19.310]  We've posted it at Infowars.com as well, last week when it first came out.
[01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:20.591]  But there's a whole bunch of great ads.
[01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:27.614]  I would just go to the Ron Paul official website or YouTube page and get, you know, the ads that you think are most effective and send them to people.
[01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:32.111]  And they're refreshing because you've never seen political ads like this.
[01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:34.012]  Because it's about the Constitution.
[01:04:34.072 --> 01:04:36.533]  It's about America and what made the country great.
[01:04:37.053 --> 01:04:39.294]  It's about just being decent people again.
[01:04:40.254 --> 01:04:41.535]  But no, we can't have that.
[01:04:41.555 --> 01:04:45.336]  We've got to be an empire run by a bunch of psycho-eugenicist globalists.
[01:04:46.036 --> 01:04:46.416]  All right.
[01:04:47.397 --> 01:04:54.279]  Speaking of Ron Paul, one of his big supporters, talk show host, Marine Corps veteran of Vietnam, Adam Kokesh, coming up.
[01:04:54.299 --> 01:04:55.760]  He's got a veterans march planned.
[01:04:58.874 --> 01:05:01.495]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[01:05:01.795 --> 01:05:05.277]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[01:05:05.477 --> 01:05:05.697]  Number 10.
[01:05:05.997 --> 01:05:08.278]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:08.758]  Number 9.
[01:05:09.278 --> 01:05:11.099]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[01:05:11.559 --> 01:05:14.400]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:14.400]  7.
[01:05:15.341 --> 01:05:16.801]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:16.801]  6.
[01:05:18.362 --> 01:05:20.523]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[01:05:21.603 --> 01:05:24.484]  I always have access to high quality and delicious food.
[01:05:24.744 --> 01:05:28.505]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[01:05:28.745 --> 01:05:31.845]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[01:05:32.126 --> 01:05:36.247]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[01:05:36.447 --> 01:05:42.288]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[01:05:42.668 --> 01:05:43.429]  Folks, don't wait.
[01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:44.791]  Get prepared now.
[01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:46.534]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:46.814 --> 01:05:49.358]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[01:05:49.398 --> 01:05:51.802]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:05:59.332 --> 01:06:00.854]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.054 --> 01:06:06.099]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:06:06.359 --> 01:06:07.740]  Saving means to make money.
[01:06:07.901 --> 01:06:16.689]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:24.514]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:06:24.954 --> 01:06:32.558]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:37.880]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:06:38.181 --> 01:06:40.362]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:06:57.924 --> 01:07:04.906]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:22.732]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:07:22.992 --> 01:07:28.994]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:07:29.194 --> 01:07:37.036]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:07:37.336 --> 01:07:40.437]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:43.601]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:07:43.661 --> 01:07:44.703]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:07:44.923 --> 01:07:45.664]  It's incredible.

[01:08:03.376 --> 01:08:07.580]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:09.021]  You want answers?
[01:08:09.802 --> 01:08:10.803]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:11.344 --> 01:08:14.967]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.527 --> 01:08:19.631]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:40.501]  All right, we're going to Adam Kokesh here in just a moment.
[01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:45.542]  I agree with Adam's point and the point that many others have made.
[01:08:46.103 --> 01:08:58.386]  The fact that Ron Paul consistently has gotten 70 plus percent of all presidential donations for Republicans and Obama combined, and we're going to show you a video graph of that in a moment,
[01:08:59.938 --> 01:09:06.428]  Really illustrates that the military's awake and are good patriots compared to the average American.
[01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.731]  They're more informed about what's going on.
[01:09:08.751 --> 01:09:11.455]  I have to say that's what it conclusively shows.
[01:09:11.716 --> 01:09:15.562]  A, and B, it just, it fits into all the other evidence we've got.
[01:09:16.738 --> 01:09:36.153]  The most bumper stickers, the number one Twitters, the Google search terms, winning the straw polls, winning the scientific polls, winning the internet polls, having the biggest crowds, everyone I know, everywhere I go, Ron Paul, Ron Paul, Ron Paul, but the establishment saying he can't win, he can't win, he can't win.
[01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:43.467]  And now Ron Paul's come out and said there are anomalies, it looks like fraud, we're contesting Maine.
[01:09:43.487 --> 01:09:47.531]  Yeah, and there was total fraud confirmed three weeks after Paul didn't contest it in Iowa.
[01:09:57.179 --> 01:09:59.640]  And there was fraud, of course, in Nevada.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.362]  Because they can't have him winning, because then he'd get the nomination and he'd win.
[01:10:03.602 --> 01:10:05.883]  But no, he is the nominee.
[01:10:06.223 --> 01:10:07.884]  He is our president.
[01:10:08.924 --> 01:10:09.225]  He is.
[01:10:09.265 --> 01:10:10.145]  He would beat Obama.
[01:10:10.805 --> 01:10:11.346]  Hands down.
[01:10:11.366 --> 01:10:12.686]  They've got Gallup polls on that.
[01:10:13.286 --> 01:10:17.228]  The polls always show he'd be winning, but magically something happens.
[01:10:17.869 --> 01:10:25.132]  Remember that Republican Fox News correspondent on the radio in Ames saying, don't worry, I've talked to the insiders, he's not going to be allowed to win.
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.985]  And on record, they just didn't allow the calls to be called in.
[01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:36.136]  And then Karl Rove and others met and bragged that they decided Santorum would be above Paul and that it would go to Mitt Romney.
[01:10:36.577 --> 01:10:38.640]  And they're so arrogant, they tell you that!
[01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:42.572]  Now, here is an ad that I think is one of the best ones I've seen.
[01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:48.734]  Adherence to the Oath, and we've got it posted up at Infowars.com, but that's the name of this new ad running.
[01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:53.536]  Then we'll go to Adam Kokesh, who's organizing a big rally of veterans there in D.C.
[01:10:53.896 --> 01:11:00.078]  to point out they support Ron Paul, and hopefully break this hoax that Ron Paul doesn't have military support.
[01:11:00.358 --> 01:11:05.280]  You notice during the debates and in the media, they keep saying, military doesn't like you because you're against all these wars.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.061]  When it's the exact opposite, and they know it.
[01:11:08.341 --> 01:11:18.943]  It's all part of their hatred of the American people, and their disdain, and their hubris, chutzpah, arrogant, over-the-top deception.
[01:11:19.504 --> 01:11:22.604]  Like Hitler said, the bigger the lie, the better, because the more people will believe it.
[01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:26.746]  And once you buy into something so big, you don't want to admit you've been conned later.
[01:11:27.066 --> 01:11:28.346]  Here is that video.
[01:11:30.336 --> 01:11:34.058]  That we were brought up loving our country and our Constitution.
[01:11:34.078 --> 01:11:37.739]  That in the United States of America, we were free.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.701]  And that's an attitude that we've tried to instill in our children.
[01:11:41.721 --> 01:11:45.403]  I met my wife while in the Air Force.
[01:11:45.503 --> 01:11:47.223]  I was a combat pilot in Vietnam.
[01:11:47.824 --> 01:11:49.624]  I served in Desert Storm as a commander.
[01:11:51.025 --> 01:11:54.687]  When I graduated from the Academy, I took the oath of office.
[01:11:55.587 --> 01:11:59.429]  And as a commander, I administered that oath to many people.
[01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:09.718]  Now I wonder about the understanding people have of our Constitution, and I think about our candidates for President of the United States.
[01:12:11.678 --> 01:12:25.981]  It's interesting to see the support Ron Paul gets from the military and if we think back to the Code of Conduct and people raising their right hand that they were going to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[01:12:26.921 --> 01:12:31.722]  Why would those same people support in great numbers Ron Paul?
[01:12:33.702 --> 01:12:37.603]  I think it's because they know that he supports the Constitution of the United States.
[01:12:38.567 --> 01:12:41.249]  It doesn't mean you have to go to war to do it.
[01:12:41.269 --> 01:12:53.636]  It means you have to understand what the Constitution is and be a supporter inside of your own country, whether you're in the military or not, of that Constitution and make the United States strong.
[01:12:54.697 --> 01:12:56.318]  And Ron Paul does that.
[01:12:56.878 --> 01:12:57.619]  That's his feeling.
[01:12:57.699 --> 01:12:58.459]  That's his thrust.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.982]  And that's why if you look at the percentages
[01:13:02.862 --> 01:13:06.727]  That support him and the military, it's huge.
[01:13:07.468 --> 01:13:08.049]  Why is that?
[01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:14.118]  Because they've raised their right hands and they're putting their lives on the line for us here in the United States.
[01:13:14.738 --> 01:13:16.381]  And they know that Ron Paul does the same.
[01:13:20.245 --> 01:13:24.169]  Okay, so get that video out to everybody.
[01:13:24.369 --> 01:13:35.239]  Now going to Adam Kokesh, radio talk show host, TV host, investigative reporter, United States Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War where he was a corporal.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.921]  And he joins us now.
[01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:43.662]  He's organizing a march for veterans, supporting Ron Paul.
[01:13:43.702 --> 01:13:46.163]  The headline is, Ron Paul is the choice of the troops.
[01:13:46.603 --> 01:13:48.984]  March on the White House, and then I guess to the Capitol.
[01:13:49.484 --> 01:13:50.525]  Very, very exciting.
[01:13:50.585 --> 01:13:53.525]  Get this out to everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:53.986 --> 01:14:01.028]  In fact, I know we've already posted it, but I want to repost, ask one of the web guys to repost this bulletin to the front page of InfoWars.com.
[01:14:01.748 --> 01:14:05.470]  Adam, I think that's a pretty powerful ad that the Revolution Pack put out.
[01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:07.171]  They're doing a great job for Ron Paul.
[01:14:09.092 --> 01:14:13.335]  Tell us why you're organizing this event and when it is and how folks can get involved.
[01:14:14.019 --> 01:14:31.041]  Absolutely, and thank you so much for having me on, Alex, and giving me the opportunity to promote this to your audience, because I know it's something that you care so much about, and I know it's something that they care about, and I know that there are a lot of veterans and active duty troops who listen to your show who are also inspired by the message of liberty that Ron Paul shares, and that's why we're doing this, because
[01:14:31.682 --> 01:14:33.343]  Ron Paul is the choice of the troops.
[01:14:33.383 --> 01:14:34.283]  That's the name of the event.
[01:14:34.323 --> 01:14:35.904]  That's the message we're trying to get across.
[01:14:36.264 --> 01:14:50.330]  Because if this weren't true about any other candidate, this inconvenient little fact that he's gotten more campaign contributions from active duty troops than all others put together, as far as the media is concerned, the race would be over and whoever they could say that about would have the nomination clinched.
[01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:55.532]  But if it's Ron Paul and they don't understand why, they're gonna sweep that fact under the rug instead.
[01:14:55.872 --> 01:14:58.294]  And it's not despite his foreign policy.
[01:14:58.334 --> 01:14:59.054]  It's not, well,
[01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:03.677]  The Constitution, but at least Ron Paul is a veteran.
[01:15:03.737 --> 01:15:09.561]  No, it's because of the foreign policy that the troops overwhelmingly support Ron Paul.
[01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:14.264]  It's because of a constitutional non-interventionist foreign policy, but it's really
[01:15:14.884 --> 01:15:20.208]  For the same reasons that any other American votes a particular way or really does anything.
[01:15:20.248 --> 01:15:25.052]  We're not such a distinct subculture that we're not also creatures of pragmatism.
[01:15:25.413 --> 01:15:43.948]  And when you're the ones with your lives on the line, when you're the ones who have to face the combat and have to face that reality and want a commander-in-chief who's going to be decisive, who's going to put America's security interests first, who is only going to send you into harm's way with a clear moral imperative, or as Ron Paul would call it, a constitutional declaration of war,
[01:15:44.528 --> 01:15:56.745]  You're kind of motivated to do the research, to do the homework, to look behind the illusions of the mainstream media, to see why is it that all of these other candidates are supporting this globalist foreign policy.
[01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:59.348]  Why are they supporting a policy that would make me
[01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:01.991]  A tool of the globalists.
[01:16:02.031 --> 01:16:05.675]  And that really inspires the troops to support Ron Paul.
[01:16:05.715 --> 01:16:19.288]  And while we have this beautiful statistic as to how much the active duty support him because they list their employers when they donate to the presidential campaign, we're having this event in part to show that there's a similar parallel of support within the veterans community.
[01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:21.750]  But also we're inviting active duty to join us.
[01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:40.686]  We have a lot of guys from active duty that are joining us for this event which is very exciting because we're creating an opportunity for active duty troops and veterans within their communities to reach out to each other and talk to each other about the message of Ron Paul and talk to each other about why we need to have a moral imperative and some real principle behind our foreign policy.
[01:16:40.746 --> 01:16:43.849]  So at noon next Monday on President's Day
[01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:48.213]  We are going to be rallying at the Sylvan Theater at the base of the Washington Monument.
[01:16:48.233 --> 01:16:54.419]  We're going to have a series of speakers based on who has done the best job promoting this event through our YouTube video contest.
[01:16:54.439 --> 01:17:00.906]  So the message of this event beyond Ron Paul is the choice of the troops is really going to be defined by the participants.
[01:17:00.926 --> 01:17:06.891]  We're very excited to see that we've had over 20 video entries already and people are really jumping on board with us to support it because
[01:17:07.512 --> 01:17:09.593]  It's an event that people were waiting to happen.
[01:17:09.673 --> 01:17:20.721]  So at 2 o'clock, 1400 hours, we're going to be forming up in a full military formation on 15th Street, facing towards Constitution Avenue and stepping off towards the White House.
[01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:37.112]  Everyone in formation will be required to present proof of service, but we also invite family members of service members to march behind us and for supporters to line the route and to be with us at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue when we form up again in front of the White House.
[01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:43.417]  To do an about-face and turn our backs on the President in a repudiation of his foreign policy.
[01:17:43.457 --> 01:17:55.467]  The foreign policy of imperialism, of globalism, of using the troops as cannon fodder, or as Henry Kissinger so famously referred to us as, dumb stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy.
[01:17:56.067 --> 01:18:07.780]  And after turning our backs on the White House, we are going to hold a flag-folding ceremony and hold a hand salute for as many seconds as troops have died both abroad and by suicide since Obama took office.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.282]  And it's going to be over half an hour.
[01:18:09.322 --> 01:18:10.584]  It's going to be a long salute.
[01:18:11.024 --> 01:18:14.869]  And it's going to be a pretty dramatic visual that we hope the mainstream media can't ignore.
[01:18:14.909 --> 01:18:16.871]  And if they do, they do so at their own peril.
[01:18:17.232 --> 01:18:21.477]  Because to ignore the troops is to ignore a voice that the American people hold so dear.
[01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:28.486]  And as all military regulations regarding free speech have been designed to keep the troops quiet, to keep voices of dissent silent,
[01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:40.490]  To keep the troops serving only as pretty backdrops for presidential speeches, or when Ben Bernanke wants to go down to Fort Hood and use the troops as political pawns, as backdrops for his economic schemes.
[01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:42.191]  Well, we're saying no more.
[01:18:42.311 --> 01:18:42.911]  Not anymore.
[01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:44.352]  The voice of the troops will be heard.
[01:18:44.392 --> 01:18:45.932]  The voice of the veterans will be heard.
[01:18:46.192 --> 01:18:52.715]  And it will be made clear to the American people that Ron Paul is the choice of the troops on Monday, February 20th, President's Day.
[01:18:53.075 --> 01:18:56.757]  We really encourage people to get involved, and like I said, I'm so grateful for the opportunity.
[01:18:57.077 --> 01:18:57.657]  Are you kidding?
[01:18:57.697 --> 01:19:02.699]  We're grateful for the work you're doing and all the veterans and currently serving active duty that are going to be out there.
[01:19:03.579 --> 01:19:09.041]  And again, it won't matter if the dinosaur corporate whore media, traitor media, globalist sellout media isn't there, Adam.
[01:19:09.302 --> 01:19:11.642]  The real media that's exploding is going to be there.
[01:19:12.063 --> 01:19:14.924]  That's why the system's rushing in trying to start censoring us.
[01:19:15.464 --> 01:19:18.047]  We've just had some new behind-the-scenes attempts at censoring.
[01:19:18.627 --> 01:19:20.469]  I'll be announcing that later in the week or next week.
[01:19:20.509 --> 01:19:23.472]  But we're all under attack because we're over the target.
[01:19:24.052 --> 01:19:32.360]  And as that ad I played earlier said, we need to defend the Constitution here, all of us, veterans, Americans, anybody who loves liberty.
[01:19:32.681 --> 01:19:33.502]  But your idea...
[01:19:34.497 --> 01:19:43.403]  is genius to force out the fact that 70 plus percent of the troops support Ron Paul and that there's a hoax covering that up.
[01:19:43.763 --> 01:19:50.367]  Because if that fact gets out there to the general public, they'll even see the media cover up to a greater extent.
[01:19:50.627 --> 01:19:52.148]  And I want to get your take after the break too.
[01:19:52.168 --> 01:19:55.430]  Do you agree that clearly he's the frontrunner if you look at all the polls and stuff?
[01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:57.031]  They're just cheating Ron Paul.
[01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:58.532]  We'll be right back with Adam Kokesh.
[01:19:58.772 --> 01:20:04.277]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[01:20:04.617 --> 01:20:07.739]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.

[01:20:49.359 --> 01:20:51.642]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.

[01:20:55.609 --> 01:20:58.093]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[01:20:58.795 --> 01:20:59.576]  IRS.
[01:20:59.937 --> 01:21:02.239]  The three most dreaded letters of the alphabet.
[01:21:02.499 --> 01:21:12.871]  If you owe back taxes, have unfiled tax returns, are receiving threatening letters, or have IRS agents coming to your home or place of business, you need an experienced IRS agent fighting on your side.

[01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:36.917]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:36.977 --> 01:22:37.718]  This capitalism?
[01:22:37.778 --> 01:22:43.922]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:44.863]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:44.903 --> 01:22:48.005]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:22:48.165 --> 01:22:48.965]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:22:50.686 --> 01:22:50.967]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:58.011 --> 01:23:00.333]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[01:23:00.533 --> 01:23:02.375]  Storable foods are also in high demand.

[01:24:05.117 --> 01:24:10.241]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[01:24:10.681 --> 01:24:14.144]  I've never been with anything less than a dime.
[01:24:14.685 --> 01:24:15.065]  So fine.
[01:24:15.643 --> 01:24:35.028]  Alright, what we're going to do is, this is important, I've linked to it in the last few days, but I got Curt Nemo doing a big article about this too with all the links to Adam Kokesh's website, to the Facebook where it's being promoted, and also to the video, Adherence to the Oath, that I think is the best Ron Paul ad out there, bar none.
[01:24:35.828 --> 01:24:37.048]  Put out by Revolution Pack.
[01:24:37.388 --> 01:24:38.909]  You gotta give Gary Franchi credit.
[01:24:39.329 --> 01:24:44.470]  I mean, he's another example of people that take action, don't in-fight, and cover real issues can do.
[01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:50.313]  Most other people just get tied up in knots by Cass Sunstein cognitive dissonance type stuff.
[01:24:50.733 --> 01:24:54.835]  Look at him now, producing better TV ads than the Ron Paul campaign is.
[01:24:55.876 --> 01:24:58.297]  You know, really getting the truth out and having a big effect.
[01:24:58.597 --> 01:25:04.120]  And that's why MSNBC and other trader groups, other foreign groups, not really traders, they represent foreign banks.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.041]  I guess they're not traders.
[01:25:05.421 --> 01:25:09.843]  They're just occupiers, are freaking out about and demonizing him for.
[01:25:12.486 --> 01:25:22.980]  Overall, what do you think about, obviously the point I'm making, that this is the Achilles heel here, this hoax, that the troops don't support Ron Paul when it's the opposite?
[01:25:25.131 --> 01:25:31.335]  It's so important to put it in their face that Ron Paul is the choice of the troops and come out with the numbers that make it undeniable to show that.
[01:25:31.395 --> 01:25:40.402]  I mean, I would challenge any other candidates to have a veterans organization to show this kind of support for them to host an event like this and turn out the numbers that we're going to turn out.
[01:25:40.442 --> 01:25:48.267]  But that's why it's so critical, Alex, exactly because of what you just stated, that this is the most inconvenient fact about Ron Paul to the establishment.
[01:25:48.527 --> 01:25:49.828]  Let's put that in their faces.
[01:25:49.868 --> 01:25:52.010]  Let's take the most difficult thing for them to accept.
[01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:56.993]  And force them to acknowledge that this is what the troops are seeing and that this is what the troops want.
[01:25:57.253 --> 01:26:04.918]  Now, when I first had this idea, this vision, I want to thank Nathan Cox, the co-founder of Veterans for Ron Paul, for helping me out with this event.
[01:26:05.318 --> 01:26:14.925]  But when we put this idea together, we thought if we just had a platoon-sized element, if we just had 40 guys and gals in this march, it would create the right visual, it would work.
[01:26:15.445 --> 01:26:21.389]  And we floated the idea around online a few different places and saw that the reaction in the Ron Paul community and the movement was just
[01:26:22.372 --> 01:26:23.576]  No, it's got to be huge.
[01:26:24.058 --> 01:26:24.219]  Yeah.
[01:26:25.114 --> 01:26:25.534]  No, we're good.
[01:26:25.554 --> 01:26:28.075]  My goal is, you know, it's the last week, we've got less than a week to go.
[01:26:28.115 --> 01:26:33.376]  Well, if you have a good formation up front that goes, or a whole bunch of formations, it'll really look good.
[01:26:33.956 --> 01:26:34.436]  Oh, no.
[01:26:34.476 --> 01:26:46.959]  Well, like I said, we've got less than a week to go, so it's really this critical crunch time right now, and any help that people can give us, getting the word out, or donating to Support the Cause to help get some veterans that can't afford to travel, we really appreciate it.
[01:26:47.459 --> 01:26:53.081]  And the place to do that is adamvstheman.com slash VFRP, Veterans for Ron Paul.
[01:26:54.301 --> 01:26:58.246]  I'm pretty confident we're going to have about 500 veterans there, at least at this point.
[01:26:58.286 --> 01:27:00.548]  We've got 1,500 RSVP'd on Facebook.
[01:27:00.568 --> 01:27:07.757]  We're getting a lot of emails from active duty guys saying, well, you know, I can't quite put my name on this thing, but I'll be there with my whole squad.
[01:27:07.817 --> 01:27:09.419]  I mean, it's really incredible.
[01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:10.460]  There should be a lot more than 500.
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:16.608]  You need to get all the motorcycle veterans groups that, you know, are usually worshipping whatever Republicans around.
[01:27:16.968 --> 01:27:18.930]  They need to get out there and support Ron Paul.
[01:27:19.171 --> 01:27:20.713]  There needs to be 100,000 people.
[01:27:20.753 --> 01:27:24.818]  But regardless, it certainly illustrates the type of support Ron Paul has.
[01:27:25.238 --> 01:27:26.099]  Now, shifting gears.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.902]  Clearly now looking at all the evidence.
[01:27:29.322 --> 01:27:30.583]  Ron Paul's the frontrunner.
[01:27:30.983 --> 01:27:32.544]  They're stealing the election from him.
[01:27:33.005 --> 01:27:38.509]  He doesn't want to look like a sore loser or a bad sport, but finally he's coming out and saying they're going to contest Maine.
[01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:40.090]  Adam, what's your view?
[01:27:40.330 --> 01:27:42.632]  You've been involved in congressional races and things.
[01:27:43.012 --> 01:27:44.293]  What's your view of what's going on?
[01:27:45.558 --> 01:27:51.781]  Well, it's, you know, I'm not surprised at all that this is happening and that they're cheating around the edges and doing what it takes.
[01:27:51.841 --> 01:28:06.207]  I don't think it's the kind of widespread fraud, because I saw this in, you know, I mean, I don't mean to say that it's not having the full impact of what widespread fraud might be, but just that it's not so necessary when you have
[01:28:06.847 --> 01:28:13.935]  A system that so favors the establishment in the very process of determining who's going to be the nominee.
[01:28:13.975 --> 01:28:18.100]  And I saw this firsthand in Iowa, watching polls there.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:23.526]  I actually made sure that one more vote was counted for Michelle Bachmann.
[01:28:24.526 --> 01:28:27.047]  When she was under-tallied at that event.
[01:28:27.347 --> 01:28:28.767]  And that was the mistake.
[01:28:28.927 --> 01:28:34.189]  It's just amazing to see how easy it is to get these mistakes.
[01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:40.111]  I don't know if it's that Republican establishment party-hack volunteers don't know how to count.
[01:28:40.491 --> 01:28:41.811]  I don't think that's always the case.
[01:28:42.231 --> 01:28:45.512]  But it's such a muddled process.
[01:28:45.672 --> 01:28:47.953]  It's such an untransparent process.
[01:28:48.593 --> 01:28:58.984]  It's a process where really the whims of local party officials hold way more sway than they're supposed to, or that we would hope they would.
[01:28:59.384 --> 01:29:09.635]  And it's not just necessarily the fraud, but even the way that the system is set up to favor those in the establishment to be able to tilt the contest in their favor.
[01:29:09.855 --> 01:29:13.556]  The system itself has become twisted and gamed and tilted.
[01:29:13.936 --> 01:29:19.417]  I want to do a few more minutes with you, then I'm going to your calls, folks, and getting to that world government news that Obama's calling for.
[01:29:19.457 --> 01:29:20.597]  But Adam, stay there.
[01:29:20.637 --> 01:29:32.199]  I want to get your take as a veteran and as a libertarian, your view on the upcoming Iran war, the upcoming peace invasion by the UN of Syria.
[01:29:32.619 --> 01:29:33.859]  I mean, when is this going to end?
[01:29:34.259 --> 01:29:38.360]  The NDAA, SOPA, everything we talked about
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.603]  It is now coming true.
[01:29:40.623 --> 01:29:42.445]  It is just wild.
[01:29:42.486 --> 01:29:44.308]  I want to get your take on that straight ahead.
[01:29:44.328 --> 01:29:45.730]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:46.391]  Spread the word.
[01:29:46.451 --> 01:29:47.814]  InfoWars.com.
[01:29:47.854 --> 01:29:48.735]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.256 --> 01:29:50.818]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.838 --> 01:29:54.463]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.544 --> 01:29:59.804]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:59.864 --> 01:30:05.206]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:05.446 --> 01:30:10.068]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:10.468 --> 01:30:15.490]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:20.733]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:21.254 --> 01:30:23.175]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:30:23.575 --> 01:30:28.178]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:28.378 --> 01:30:29.279]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:29.479 --> 01:30:32.261]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:30:32.561 --> 01:30:35.863]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:36.184 --> 01:30:39.025]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:39.366 --> 01:30:41.267]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:41.587 --> 01:30:42.508]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:46.150 --> 01:30:47.170]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:54.892]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:55.212 --> 01:30:57.672]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:59.172 --> 01:31:13.595]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:14.625 --> 01:31:18.346]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:19.327 --> 01:31:31.331]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:32.091 --> 01:31:39.354]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:40.054 --> 01:31:49.638]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:31:50.418 --> 01:31:53.679]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:57.441]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:58.447 --> 01:32:01.069]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[01:32:01.369 --> 01:32:04.852]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:05.533]  Number 10.
[01:32:05.573 --> 01:32:07.855]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[01:32:08.115 --> 01:32:08.335]  Number 9.
[01:32:08.875 --> 01:32:10.677]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[01:32:10.697 --> 01:32:13.979]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:13.979]  7.
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.381]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[01:32:16.882 --> 01:32:16.381]  6.
[01:32:17.943 --> 01:32:20.104]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[01:32:21.185 --> 01:32:24.048]  I always have access to high-quality and delicious food.
[01:32:24.348 --> 01:32:28.092]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[01:32:28.332 --> 01:32:31.435]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[01:32:31.715 --> 01:32:35.839]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[01:32:36.039 --> 01:32:41.885]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[01:32:42.245 --> 01:32:43.006]  Folks, don't wait.
[01:32:43.186 --> 01:32:44.367]  Get prepared now.
[01:32:44.428 --> 01:32:46.109]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:48.952]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[01:32:48.973 --> 01:32:51.375]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:33:19.121 --> 01:33:21.524]  All right, we're going back to Adam Kokesh in a moment.
[01:33:22.345 --> 01:33:33.337]  Then I'm going to get to a clip of a Dallas CBS newscast where the women, just like the old women in New York, were saying, hey, they can take us behind closed doors and take our clothes off, take our diapers off.
[01:33:33.377 --> 01:33:35.940]  Some of them 90 plus years old scream at us.
[01:33:36.801 --> 01:33:38.402]  And the TSA said, we're not doing that.
[01:33:38.422 --> 01:33:41.924]  Kind of like they said, we're not groping small children or going in their diapers.
[01:33:42.144 --> 01:33:43.565]  Caught on video hundreds of times.
[01:33:43.865 --> 01:33:45.166]  We're going to stop that now.
[01:33:45.506 --> 01:33:46.126]  Never stop.
[01:33:46.406 --> 01:33:48.127]  There's no radiation from the scanners.
[01:33:48.187 --> 01:33:49.048]  Get caught lying.
[01:33:50.909 --> 01:33:52.029]  On and on and on.
[01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:54.871]  And the incredible proclivity for crime.
[01:33:55.271 --> 01:34:02.575]  Well, who do you think, on average, is going to want a job bullying innocent people all day and sticking your hands down people's pants?
[01:34:03.567 --> 01:34:08.068]  I had a guy trying to grope me at the Vegas airport, and I said, first off, those gloves are filthy.
[01:34:08.708 --> 01:34:09.708]  How long you had those on?
[01:34:09.728 --> 01:34:10.889]  Oh, I've had them on about an hour.
[01:34:10.909 --> 01:34:13.289]  You've been searching people for an hour.
[01:34:13.789 --> 01:34:14.890]  How long you gonna wear those?
[01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:17.490]  Oh, why are you wearing gloves then?
[01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:20.131]  Oh, to protect you, you fat slob!
[01:34:21.611 --> 01:34:22.131]  Not me!
[01:34:22.832 --> 01:34:25.572]  Gonna walk through your MRSA and athlete's foot?
[01:34:26.312 --> 01:34:26.832]  I'm ranting.
[01:34:27.853 --> 01:34:28.753]  That's coming up.
[01:34:30.054 --> 01:34:32.635]  And I'm going to get to this world tax, world government announcement.
[01:34:32.895 --> 01:34:34.416]  First it's Ban Ki-moon last week.
[01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:35.956]  Now it's Obama!
[01:34:36.396 --> 01:34:37.437]  But it doesn't exist.
[01:34:37.477 --> 01:34:43.859]  The Southern Poverty Law Center will write a big report on you and say you're dangerous and send alerts out to law enforcement if you're a real American.
[01:34:44.799 --> 01:34:46.020]  Well, sorry, game over.
[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:47.160]  I talked to the military.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:47.941]  I talked to police.
[01:34:47.961 --> 01:34:48.981]  They're all starting to wake up.
[01:34:50.333 --> 01:34:56.422]  They still got some goons and idiots in the police force here and there, but we are gaining momentum.
[01:34:56.442 --> 01:34:57.423]  That's why the system's panicking.
[01:34:57.484 --> 01:35:00.708]  We're going back to Adam Kokesh to get his take on all this here in just a moment.
[01:35:01.633 --> 01:35:06.616]  We're carrying a lot of new books on the online video slash apparel store at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:06.756 --> 01:35:11.658]  We're selling a whole combo pack of different InfoWars.com bumper stickers.
[01:35:11.678 --> 01:35:12.799]  Got a lot of new ones in.
[01:35:13.199 --> 01:35:14.399]  Color stickers, you name it.
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:15.520]  At cost.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:16.701]  At cost.
[01:35:17.401 --> 01:35:17.921]  At cost.
[01:35:18.301 --> 01:35:21.043]  And we have stencils so you can spray paint your barn or car.
[01:35:21.703 --> 01:35:22.824]  Big three foot stencils.
[01:35:23.264 --> 01:35:23.884]  At cost.
[01:35:24.084 --> 01:35:24.905]  Six bucks a piece.
[01:35:26.607 --> 01:35:38.838]  It's all available at InfoWars.com, and then we have things we make a profit off of, like, well, we're running it till the end of the month, all 18 of my films and Jason Burmese's film, Invisible Empire, 70-plus percent off.
[01:35:42.134 --> 01:35:42.914]  $99.95 would be normally $380.
[01:35:43.114 --> 01:35:46.015]  Okay, we do make a small profit on that.
[01:35:46.035 --> 01:35:47.996]  You get a free Citizen Rule book and bumper stickers.
[01:35:48.456 --> 01:35:49.617]  And the Fed bumper sticker too.
[01:35:49.997 --> 01:35:51.298]  And your purchase supports the show.
[01:35:51.598 --> 01:35:52.878]  You want to meet like-minded people?
[01:35:52.918 --> 01:35:54.679]  Buy some InfoWars.com t-shirts.
[01:35:55.039 --> 01:35:57.280]  Put an InfoWars.com bumper sticker on your car.
[01:35:57.781 --> 01:36:01.882]  Whatever you do, don't stick them on government buildings or globalist propaganda outlets.
[01:36:02.463 --> 01:36:03.903]  You shouldn't do that.
[01:36:03.943 --> 01:36:06.304]  Just roll over and take the vaccines immediately.
[01:36:06.605 --> 01:36:06.865]  Okay.
[01:36:07.885 --> 01:36:09.546]  Being serious here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:10.286 --> 01:36:13.007]  We've also got Bloodlines Illuminati available.
[01:36:13.447 --> 01:36:16.989]  We've also got John Wesley Rawls' new book by popular demand.
[01:36:17.049 --> 01:36:18.529]  He's on, I think, what is it, Thursday?
[01:36:19.210 --> 01:36:20.010]  That's available.
[01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:23.131]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:23.591 --> 01:36:30.174]  And don't forget, you can still get tickets where I'm going to give a speech and premiere a 30-minute documentary this Sunday in Dallas.
[01:36:31.215 --> 01:36:31.635]  Find out
[01:36:32.535 --> 01:36:37.940]  More and showtimes and location at Infowars.com forward slash events.
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:41.103]  But now, without further ado, going back to Adam Kokesh.
[01:36:41.703 --> 01:36:45.407]  Adam, it's all coming true.
[01:36:45.547 --> 01:36:48.569]  I mean, we were the kooks to warn about using the military on the streets.
[01:36:48.649 --> 01:36:49.130]  It's happening.
[01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:52.073]  NDAA, police state, all of it.
[01:36:52.113 --> 01:36:53.454]  World government being announced.
[01:36:53.494 --> 01:36:54.575]  I mean, it's crazy, Adam.
[01:36:55.523 --> 01:37:06.752]  That's why it's so important to have an event like this, the Ron Paul's The Choice of the Troops March, to be able to create a way to reach out to guys on active duty, because when it comes to that, we have to ensure that they know that they're still human beings.
[01:37:07.392 --> 01:37:12.216]  This is why the work of Oath Keepers is so important, ensuring that they honor their oath rather than their illegal orders.
[01:37:12.256 --> 01:37:23.805]  But Alex, if I may for just a minute, I have one more important announcement about this event coming up, because we have an incredible lineup for the after-party of musicians, the cream of the crop of the musical talent of the Freedom Movement.
[01:37:24.045 --> 01:37:25.045]  Who support the troops?
[01:37:25.346 --> 01:37:26.406]  Who support Ron Paul?
[01:37:26.646 --> 01:37:34.869]  And we're going to have Amy Allen, Jordan Page, Golden State with your good friend James Grundler, shout out to him for stepping up for this, and Rebel Inc.
[01:37:34.909 --> 01:37:37.310]  But we also have an exciting last-minute addition.
[01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:46.093]  Michael Graves, the former Misfits frontman, came out on Adam vs. the Man just last week to announce that he's endorsing Ron Paul and will be performing for us at this event.
[01:37:46.113 --> 01:37:50.195]  So the website is March 2, the number 2, March2WhiteHouse.com.
[01:37:51.135 --> 01:37:54.599]  And we're going to be selling these tickets out, so if you want to get in on this, get in now.
[01:37:57.923 --> 01:37:59.986]  But you're not going to have Danzig there from the Misfits.
[01:38:01.748 --> 01:38:02.869]  No, no, no.
[01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:06.754]  Well, if you look at his politics, it's a little scarier.
[01:38:06.794 --> 01:38:10.037]  I'm much more excited to have someone who's woken up on our side.
[01:38:11.417 --> 01:38:11.898]  It's awesome.
[01:38:11.938 --> 01:38:13.058]  It's incredible what's happening.
[01:38:13.618 --> 01:38:15.719]  And I wasn't making fun of that lead singer.
[01:38:15.759 --> 01:38:19.021]  I was just acting trendy that I know who the original lead singer was.
[01:38:19.501 --> 01:38:20.902]  See, I'm trendy, Adam.
[01:38:21.422 --> 01:38:22.542]  Extremely trendy.
[01:38:23.023 --> 01:38:30.846]  Well, you know, one of the things that I've realized is that a lot of these celebrities who are coming out and saying, well, I support Ron Paul here or there, you know, and they're kind of anxious about it.
[01:38:31.146 --> 01:38:35.728]  A lot of it's, you know, we can say things like, well, you know, they don't want to compromise their sales.
[01:38:35.748 --> 01:38:39.310]  They're afraid of being political and polarizing and alienating people.
[01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:45.172]  But, you know, we saw Kelly Clarkson do a tweet for Ron Paul that spiked her sales through the roof.
[01:38:45.772 --> 01:38:53.234]  And, you know, that's really incredible to see that we have a movement that is such an economic force, as I'm sure you know with your massive listening base.
[01:38:53.714 --> 01:38:58.035]  But, you know, that they're lacking the confidence.
[01:38:58.055 --> 01:39:04.257]  A lot of them, you know, you and I take it for granted as people that are steeped with backgrounds in politics and current events.
[01:39:04.717 --> 01:39:34.197]  Well yeah of course they should be coming out and advocating for Rod Paul and you leveraging their celebrity and getting out and talking to everybody they can and yada yada yada and everything we would hope and dream for them to do but a lot of them don't have the confidence and the background to be able to say stand behind their beliefs and articulate them clearly and one of the things I've learned is that as activists we can do a lot to help them out and as you know with your personal friendship with Charlie Sheen and that effort there I hope that's ongoing and that
[01:39:34.477 --> 01:39:40.220]  That he's able to do more for the cause, but at least we've got these five incredible headliners coming out for this event.
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.120]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:43.802]  People say, well, Charlie Sheen's got all this wild stuff in his background.
[01:39:43.902 --> 01:39:44.682]  That isn't the point.
[01:39:45.002 --> 01:39:48.804]  It brings massive attention to something, and in the media, that is key.
[01:39:48.844 --> 01:39:52.626]  Now, Adam, I want to get your perspective, though, on the Iran situation.
[01:39:53.166 --> 01:40:06.977]  I talked to Ed Asner, speaking of celebrities yesterday, and he was saying that he's talked to Navy SEALs, gave me their names and numbers and info, that they're saying, they're talking to current SEALs, that there is a false flag staged terror attack in the works to be blamed on Iran.
[01:40:08.438 --> 01:40:12.902]  It doesn't surprise me at all, Alex, but you know, I have an offer for you if you're interested.
[01:40:12.942 --> 01:40:22.189]  I'll let you respond off the air, but I'm trying to organize a trip to Iran and I'd like to have an opportunity as a journalist, if you want to call me that, to show the American people
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:31.523]  All of the shared humanity that we have with the people of Iran and let them see what we stand to lose by not stopping this war from happening.
[01:40:31.904 --> 01:40:43.048]  By not letting the globalists have their way and convince us to have another war that's obviously not in the best interest of anybody involved except those that fund it from both sides.
[01:40:43.108 --> 01:40:49.130]  So if that's of interest to you and you'd like to have a correspondent in Iran, I'd love to work with you.
[01:40:49.150 --> 01:40:52.672]  But I do think it's very scary to see that this is just kind of
[01:40:53.112 --> 01:40:53.452]  We're good.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:15.661]  It's amazing to see that no matter how much truth you show people, they still fall for this war propaganda.
[01:41:15.681 --> 01:41:17.381]  I mean, why do they do war propaganda?
[01:41:17.762 --> 01:41:18.602]  Because it works.
[01:41:18.682 --> 01:41:28.343]  And that's what's so sad about the human condition today, but it's because of journalists like yourself that we're able to fight back, we're able to change that, and I'm really hopeful.
[01:41:28.363 --> 01:41:33.964]  You know, I take the long view of human history, and I see the power of the internet coming into play like never before.
[01:41:34.024 --> 01:41:37.305]  I see the ability for people to tune into your show online, to get
[01:41:37.885 --> 01:41:41.027]  Infowars.com and everything that's so key there.
[01:41:41.327 --> 01:41:43.588]  And to see the counterpoints to that propaganda.
[01:41:43.608 --> 01:41:49.151]  So I'm very anxious and I want to be on the side of the counter propaganda.
[01:41:49.311 --> 01:41:52.113]  And I'd really appreciate your help if you're interested in getting involved.
[01:41:52.133 --> 01:42:01.138]  But being able to show that counter narrative, being able to show that there's a common humanity between the people of the United States and Iran, it's hard to deny.
[01:42:01.158 --> 01:42:02.358]  It's hard to deny.
[01:42:02.398 --> 01:42:04.359]  It's easy if you watch the mainstream media.
[01:42:04.379 --> 01:42:05.280]  It's easy if you just
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:15.662]  You know, like Thomas Jefferson said, if you are a man who reads the newspapers and are less educated than someone who reads nothing at all, if you just get that mainstream message, it's really easy to forget that.
[01:42:16.883 --> 01:42:24.945]  I agree, and as you were saying, though, exactly, but as you were saying, I mean, the wages of this are enslavement.
[01:42:25.185 --> 01:42:28.426]  They're going to use these new wars to clamp down our freedoms even more.
[01:42:28.986 --> 01:42:29.486]  I mean, here is
[01:42:31.026 --> 01:42:32.808]  The Foreign Policy Review.
[01:42:33.188 --> 01:42:37.831]  Clinton gave a speech yesterday saying we need Assad's consent to put troops in Syria.
[01:42:38.212 --> 01:42:43.735]  The UN is now saying they may listen to the Arab League and basically invade.
[01:42:44.536 --> 01:42:48.699]  There's already special forces reportedly advising Wahhabist Al-Qaeda.
[01:42:48.959 --> 01:42:53.222]  I mean, what do you make of the admission that Al-Qaeda, real Al-Qaeda, has been given Libya?
[01:42:54.443 --> 01:42:56.184]  They're now being given areas of Syria.
[01:42:56.544 --> 01:43:01.866]  They've thrown their old dictator out, Assad, and put another military dictatorship in Egypt.
[01:43:02.286 --> 01:43:06.448]  I mean, this is crazy to see Al-Qaeda openly working for NATO.
[01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.629]  Crazy?
[01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:21.915]  You're the last person I would expect to call that crazy, considering your familiarity with the history of Al-Qaeda, Alex, that you would be surprised that our government is making enemies, deliberately setting them up, and then saying, whoops!
[01:43:22.475 --> 01:43:23.597]  Sorry about that.
[01:43:23.757 --> 01:43:29.446]  Our meddling led to more American enemies that we now have to create more wars to go and vanquish.
[01:43:29.486 --> 01:43:33.873]  I mean, come on, you know Alex, you know that this is all part of the setup.
[01:43:34.794 --> 01:43:37.358]  Sure, but I'm saying what's crazy, to be clear, is that
[01:43:38.864 --> 01:43:40.025]  And I'm glad you brought that out.
[01:43:40.325 --> 01:43:56.796]  What is crazy, Adam, is that they're openly using Al-Qaeda, working for the globalists, yes I know they created them and they work for them, while still saying TSA's got to grope your wife and daughter because of Al-Qaeda, and then now Al-Qaeda, who we knew worked for them, openly works for them.
[01:43:57.037 --> 01:43:58.838]  It's crazy how dumb they think we are!
[01:43:59.858 --> 01:44:16.993]  Yes, that is what's crazy, and if that doesn't get you fired up, if that doesn't make you want to repost this video, if that doesn't make you want to bring another listener to Alex Jones, if that doesn't make you want to wake somebody else up and pull them out of the mainstream media hypnosis, I don't know what does.
[01:44:17.033 --> 01:44:17.974]  When you listen to that,
[01:44:21.255 --> 01:44:22.155]  The result is death.
[01:44:22.675 --> 01:44:24.816]  When you tune out, we can save lives.
[01:44:24.976 --> 01:44:39.759]  Simply in the act of tuning out, simply in the act of accepting a different take on reality, a more honest take on reality, a direct take on reality that's not trying to deceive you into doing anything that supports this globalism that we're seeing.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:45.721]  And so I just, like this, what you're saying, my only conclusion that I would throw back at you is
[01:44:46.141 --> 01:44:48.282]  You know, you've got to listen to people like yourself.
[01:44:48.322 --> 01:44:50.022]  You've got to listen to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:50.382 --> 01:44:55.424]  You've got to check out Adam vs. the Man, although I'm not doing the same thing exactly as Alex.
[01:44:55.764 --> 01:44:58.705]  You've got to make sure that you're unplugged from that main screen.
[01:44:58.725 --> 01:45:02.166]  Well, all of us are helping to accelerate the awakening, including our own awakenings.
[01:45:02.606 --> 01:45:07.528]  Adam, we're going to be talking to you again on the Nightly News tomorrow night, and we're going to write a big article about the march and the event.
[01:45:07.748 --> 01:45:12.250]  Everybody who wants to march on the White House peacefully, get there, be there.
[01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:13.230]  We are the media.
[01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:17.051]  Upload it all to the web, to all the BitTorrents and YouTube.
[01:45:17.351 --> 01:45:18.312]  We are the media.
[01:45:18.372 --> 01:45:21.173]  We don't even really care if the corporate whores don't show up.
[01:45:21.193 --> 01:45:26.135]  That just makes them that much more illegitimate, and more and more they're dying.
[01:45:26.215 --> 01:45:27.095]  Adam, thank you so much.
[01:45:27.535 --> 01:45:27.755]  Thanks.
[01:45:27.815 --> 01:45:29.036]  March2WhiteHouse.com.
[01:45:29.076 --> 01:45:32.637]  You can get the details of the event and where to buy tickets for the after party.
[01:45:32.677 --> 01:45:33.578]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:45:33.678 --> 01:45:34.038]  You bet.
[01:45:34.138 --> 01:45:35.558]  March2WhiteHouse.com.
[01:45:35.598 --> 01:45:36.139]  Very exciting.
[01:45:36.159 --> 01:45:36.919]  All right, there goes Adam.
[01:45:37.159 --> 01:45:47.103]  Now, look, I got a bunch of calls, people that are holding, people like Nichols and Val and Marty and Jay and Dan.
[01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:48.083]  I'm going to get to you.
[01:45:48.664 --> 01:45:51.605]  We're going to have Kaiser on at the 8 after, you know, second segment of the next hour.
[01:45:52.895 --> 01:46:02.822]  But I need to go ahead and get to this news because we're so close to Agenda 21 and global corporate governance and corporatocracy and all this that we tend to not cover it when it finally goes mainstream.
[01:46:03.242 --> 01:46:07.285]  When we're validated and just confirmed to be absolutely on target yet again.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:10.521]  But here's Kurt Nimmel's article about it.
[01:46:10.661 --> 01:46:15.622]  Obama's CFR economic council director calls for global tax.
[01:46:16.502 --> 01:46:19.243]  And if you think he spoke incorrectly, Politico links to it.
[01:46:20.164 --> 01:46:22.184]  So does Fact Check and others.
[01:46:22.484 --> 01:46:24.105]  And they're talking about global tax.
[01:46:24.725 --> 01:46:26.567]  Global government and are calling for all of it.
[01:46:26.607 --> 01:46:27.607]  Davos called for it.
[01:46:28.008 --> 01:46:30.290]  Ban Ki-moon last week, head of the UN, called for it.
[01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:32.872]  That's Kurt Nemo's article on that.
[01:46:33.452 --> 01:46:36.154]  Here is Weekly Standard, also has a similar headline.
[01:46:36.454 --> 01:46:40.137]  White House economic advisor, we need a global minimum tax.
[01:46:40.778 --> 01:46:47.984]  And then dovetailing with that, UN may get global carbon tax on air travel to avert trade war.
[01:46:49.011 --> 01:46:58.815]  Now because the Chinese are refusing to be part of it, the Financial Times of London and others are reporting that, oh, they'll just get a global agreement on the global tax that they just called for.
[01:46:59.075 --> 01:47:02.697]  They use a problem and our reaction as the solution.
[01:47:04.226 --> 01:47:07.888]  They've also got new bills out to track everything you're doing in real time.
[01:47:07.928 --> 01:47:09.889]  It's already going on, but they want to just legalize it.
[01:47:10.730 --> 01:47:13.332]  That's out of the Montreal Gazette.
[01:47:13.972 --> 01:47:15.653]  Bill provokes privacy fears.
[01:47:15.753 --> 01:47:18.775]  Net cell phone police could probe without warrant.
[01:47:18.915 --> 01:47:20.196]  I mean, it's all happening.
[01:47:20.896 --> 01:47:24.819]  Tyranny is moving in every nation right now as it's global corporate standardization.
[01:47:25.679 --> 01:47:31.503]  But these reports about his economic council director saying global minimum tax
[01:47:34.693 --> 01:47:39.156]  A global government standardized taxes at one level and have a global tax on top of it.
[01:47:39.696 --> 01:47:40.957]  All out in the open right now.
[01:47:41.918 --> 01:47:52.425]  And so next time you're a police officer and they call you into the briefing room and are reading to you ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center anti-American garbage, you'll stand up and go, well here's the Associated Press calling for global government.
[01:47:52.725 --> 01:47:53.486]  What is this?
[01:47:54.026 --> 01:47:55.067]  Break the trance!
[01:47:55.167 --> 01:48:00.331]  Stop letting the traitors that have hijacked the country turn you against the American people!
[01:48:02.694 --> 01:48:04.075]  I mean, it's coming down to it.
[01:48:04.095 --> 01:48:10.101]  When they start staging terror attacks, there could be any time if we don't get the word out, they're going to start trying to clamp down on the press.
[01:48:11.202 --> 01:48:12.904]  The globalists are going for broke.
[01:48:13.404 --> 01:48:14.165]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:48:14.205 --> 01:48:14.585]  Here it is.
[01:48:15.886 --> 01:48:19.330]  Here's the economic advisor calling for the global minimum tax.
[01:48:22.833 --> 01:48:44.364]  He supports corporate tax reform that would reduce expenditures and loopholes, lower rates for people investing and creating jobs in the U.S., do so further for manufacturing, and that we need to, as we have the Buffett Rule and the individual tax reform, we need a global minimum tax so that people have the assurance
[01:48:45.244 --> 01:49:00.358]  That nobody is escaping doing their fair share as part of a race to the bottom, or having our tax code actually subsidize and facilitate people moving their funds to tax havens.
[01:49:00.378 --> 01:49:02.380]  All right, let's stop right there.
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:06.283]  It goes on and on, the full clips at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:06.303 --> 01:49:07.204]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:49:08.325 --> 01:49:11.108]  The globalists set up the system where the mega-rich are exempt.
[01:49:12.853 --> 01:49:15.854]  They set up the system for tax incentives to move jobs overseas.
[01:49:16.674 --> 01:49:23.397]  They set up on record the entire system they're discussing and globalism, which is the race to the bottom.
[01:49:24.377 --> 01:49:26.098]  Doesn't even build up China, who is the bottom.
[01:49:26.698 --> 01:49:28.359]  Doesn't build up Mexico, who's close to the bottom.
[01:49:29.258 --> 01:49:31.659]  It drives those wages down in the aggregate as well.
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:34.021]  It's about a consolidation of power.
[01:49:34.961 --> 01:49:44.746]  Transferring out of the free market, through crony inside deals, into a corporate fascist managed Agenda 21 sustainable global grid, in their own words.
[01:49:45.287 --> 01:49:46.487]  A post-industrial world.
[01:49:46.847 --> 01:49:47.948]  A post-family world.
[01:49:50.009 --> 01:49:53.111]  Then they sick the social workers on you when you're out of work and take your kids.
[01:49:53.151 --> 01:49:55.272]  This is the stated plan in their documents.
[01:49:56.826 --> 01:50:04.720]  So, they're now going to save you from the globalism they've created, with a global authority to set global minimum taxes and raise taxes on the rich.
[01:50:05.281 --> 01:50:07.766]  The problem is, the ultra-rich will still be exempt.
[01:50:09.110 --> 01:50:15.916]  They mean sick them on business owners, millionaires, people making a couple hundred thousand dollars a year that actually keep the economy going.
[01:50:16.296 --> 01:50:20.219]  It's always the ultra-rich sicking the government on their competition.
[01:50:20.499 --> 01:50:32.830]  And that's what the Buffett rule does, that's what this global minimum tax, they say in the OECD, that's the model of this, that was the group, the corporation that was set up to take over Europe during Reconstruction, during the Marshall Plan.
[01:50:34.451 --> 01:50:36.714]  It's the model of taking over regions and bankrupting them.
[01:50:36.954 --> 01:50:39.418]  That's what the EU is, is an expansion of the Marshall Plan.
[01:50:39.978 --> 01:50:46.927]  They say the French model of 87% taxes in one form or another is the global model.
[01:50:47.508 --> 01:50:48.950]  Eighty-seven.
[01:50:49.891 --> 01:50:52.314]  Eighty-seven percent.
[01:50:56.210 --> 01:51:05.482]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:51:05.723 --> 01:51:07.986]  And my research led me to a well-known fact.
[01:51:08.226 --> 01:51:23.153]  That most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:51:23.413 --> 01:51:29.356]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Youngevity.
[01:51:29.536 --> 01:51:37.280]  The Youngevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:53:49.199 --> 01:53:49.719]  Terragonics.
[01:53:49.759 --> 01:53:50.460]  Life's getting better.
[01:54:01.658 --> 01:54:04.284]  Okay, I'm gonna take some calls in the next little short segment.
[01:54:04.324 --> 01:54:09.334]  Max Keiser's then coming on and we'll continue with calls while he's with us for those that are patiently holding.
[01:54:11.294 --> 01:54:23.478]  But you know last week the FDA came out and said they want to start regulating sugar as if it's a poison, but then they're going to let you have aspartame and bisphenol A and melamine and fluoride, all the real poisons.
[01:54:23.538 --> 01:54:25.258]  Now I'm not saying raw sugar is good for you.
[01:54:25.859 --> 01:54:27.039]  A lot of it's obviously bad.
[01:54:27.319 --> 01:54:32.821]  Like I'm not going to drink this Mexican Coke that's absolutely delicious and I'm lusting after it right now.
[01:54:33.261 --> 01:54:35.922]  The guys went to a local Mexican
[01:54:37.262 --> 01:54:39.603]  A barbecue chicken joint that's just awesome.
[01:54:40.084 --> 01:54:43.986]  A million times better than some big chain that soaks their meat in MSG.
[01:54:45.046 --> 01:54:48.528]  And they always get these Mexican Cokes that taste like Coke did when I was a kid.
[01:54:48.828 --> 01:54:54.451]  But that's another example of people demanding quality and displacing the corn syrup crud.
[01:54:54.751 --> 01:54:55.731]  High fructose corn syrup.
[01:54:56.252 --> 01:55:01.695]  Many areas of Austin now, you can't even go in a convenience store and find the modern crud Coke.
[01:55:02.415 --> 01:55:04.396]  The Mexican Coke has displaced everything.
[01:55:06.974 --> 01:55:09.616]  Just like we voted with our dollars and demanded organic food.
[01:55:10.457 --> 01:55:18.344]  The thing is about this Mexican place we go to is it's barbecued, charcoal barbecued.
[01:55:18.924 --> 01:55:19.304]  Awesome.
[01:55:20.746 --> 01:55:22.027]  No preservatives on it.
[01:55:22.907 --> 01:55:23.428]  Healthy.
[01:55:23.768 --> 01:55:31.875]  Tastes a million times better than Kentucky Fried Chicken soaked in MSG that gives you a headache for a week or Popeyes or churches or whatever the case is.
[01:55:32.355 --> 01:55:35.118]  And costs less for quality fresh food made.
[01:55:36.462 --> 01:55:38.063]  Now America used to have stuff like this.
[01:55:38.523 --> 01:55:44.047]  Just Mexico is still old-fashioned in some respects, so we have to go and get everything from Mexico.
[01:55:46.088 --> 01:55:50.211]  Because they haven't gotten around to poisoning that culture completely yet, when it comes to those areas.
[01:55:50.731 --> 01:55:53.593]  We need to go back to Americana, back to what was good.
[01:55:56.158 --> 01:55:58.800]  Or hamburgers are good too, but I'm on this diet so I'm just eating the chicken.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:03.882]  I feel good too, not eating as much because I'm taking my tangy tangerine.
[01:56:04.323 --> 01:56:07.965]  And by the way, incredible products, infowarsteam.com.

[01:56:19.992 --> 01:56:21.472]  Now, here's my next little piece.
[01:56:21.492 --> 01:56:25.675]  I already covered it some, and I said I would get into it more detail in this hour.
[01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:30.242]  But it's from CBS News.
[01:56:30.402 --> 01:56:34.664]  Our report is up on DrudgeReport.com right now as well.
[01:56:34.985 --> 01:56:40.748]  TSA forces woman to use naked body scanner three times because of a cute figure.
[01:56:41.909 --> 01:56:44.190]  Let's go ahead and play part of that clip.
[01:56:44.210 --> 01:56:47.972]  And of course the TSA will deny it, but they've already been caught doing stuff like this before.
[01:56:48.372 --> 01:56:49.173]  If you're good looking,
[01:56:50.424 --> 01:56:55.331]  And you're a guy, and it's women sometimes they naked body you and laugh about it, that's on record.
[01:56:55.631 --> 01:56:59.336]  And if you're a girl, and there's guys and they like it, they naked body scan you.
[01:56:59.796 --> 01:57:00.638]  Here's part of that clip.
[01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:03.151]  CBS 11 News investigation.
[01:57:03.171 --> 01:57:09.973]  A North Texas woman is angry and embarrassed about the way she says TSA agents treated her at DFW Airport.
[01:57:10.353 --> 01:57:14.054]  She says she was repeatedly asked to step into the body scanning machine.
[01:57:14.134 --> 01:57:18.395]  And now she believes the focus of her screening had nothing to do with national security.
[01:57:18.695 --> 01:57:23.337]  CBS 11's Ginger Allen dug into TSA records and understand that you have found a pattern of complaints.
[01:57:23.806 --> 01:57:24.066]  I did.
[01:57:24.086 --> 01:57:28.493]  You know, TSA has a policy of randomly selecting people for extra screening.
[01:57:28.853 --> 01:57:32.819]  But some travelers believe there is nothing random about the way they were picked.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:38.628]  They're complaining that agents are hand-selecting certain women for voyeuristic reasons.
[01:57:39.724 --> 01:57:44.367]  I feel like I was standing there fully exposed for some guys in a back room watching on a video camera.
[01:57:44.587 --> 01:57:46.528]  Ellen Terrell of Dallas is a mother.
[01:57:46.548 --> 01:57:47.889]  They wanted a nice good look.
[01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.669]  A wife.
[01:57:48.969 --> 01:57:52.331]  Getting a good look and then doing it again two more times.
[01:57:52.631 --> 01:57:55.653]  And possibly a victim of sexual discrimination.
[01:57:55.673 --> 01:57:56.333]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:57:56.353 --> 01:57:59.135]  You call this... Folks, it's all sexual assault.
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:05.125]  You know, they say in Denver, women can't fly now because they can't get enough female TSA agents.
[01:58:05.145 --> 01:58:06.166]  That's Denver Post.
[01:58:06.566 --> 01:58:13.152]  They're saying, yes, if we don't have female screeners to grope you, you can't fly now because you're a terrorist.
[01:58:13.873 --> 01:58:14.573]  You're all terrorists.
[01:58:14.593 --> 01:58:15.414]  You're the American people.
[01:58:15.454 --> 01:58:16.335]  We work for foreign banks.
[01:58:16.375 --> 01:58:19.698]  We're actually the terrorists, but we're going to call you terrorists and teach you to feel guilty.
[01:58:23.493 --> 01:58:25.714]  They're saying, well, we don't have any women here today, you can't fly.
[01:58:26.174 --> 01:58:28.294]  They're just like, get out of here, sweetcakes.
[01:58:29.155 --> 01:58:32.135]  Well, I mean, would it be okay for a man to rape a man?
[01:58:32.155 --> 01:58:36.337]  I mean, I don't want anybody grabbing me or my family, you scumbag, Phil.

[01:58:48.903 --> 01:58:49.903]  I had tried everything.
[01:58:49.963 --> 01:58:55.025]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:58:55.465 --> 01:58:59.946]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:59:00.286 --> 01:59:06.648]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:59:07.148 --> 01:59:17.636]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:59:18.357 --> 01:59:22.500]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:28.865]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:59:29.105 --> 01:59:30.246]  Now that's results.
[01:59:30.646 --> 01:59:43.157]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products, and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[02:00:03.171 --> 02:00:07.333]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:07.994 --> 02:00:08.814]  You want answers?
[02:00:09.575 --> 02:00:10.475]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:11.136 --> 02:00:14.778]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.318 --> 02:00:19.420]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.801 --> 02:00:23.743]  The one, the only Max Keiser coming up and your calls continuing.
[02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:26.924]  Let's go to Nicholas in Illinois right now.
[02:00:26.944 --> 02:00:29.166]  And then we'll go to Jay.
[02:00:29.926 --> 02:00:30.827]  Nicholas, you're on the air.
[02:00:30.867 --> 02:00:31.207]  Welcome.
[02:00:32.378 --> 02:00:36.360]  AJ, you're doing a great job, and I know it's been a lot of company hours.
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:37.900]  I think you need a little vacay.
[02:00:38.461 --> 02:00:41.902]  I grant you as a fellow shareholder, I think you should get a couple days vacation, you know?
[02:00:42.042 --> 02:00:42.802]  It'd be good for you.
[02:00:44.483 --> 02:00:49.065]  Well, you know, the info war never rests, but I am going to be on the road for a week.
[02:00:50.165 --> 02:00:52.166]  When I speak in Dallas and then in Florida.
[02:00:53.607 --> 02:00:55.909]  But I'll be doing the radio show every day and actually working on the road.
[02:00:55.929 --> 02:00:56.829]  This is not work.
[02:00:57.450 --> 02:01:03.253]  When a bunch of scum is taking over your society and thinks they're winning, let me tell you, I can't control myself.
[02:01:03.313 --> 02:01:04.494]  I don't even see this as work.
[02:01:04.534 --> 02:01:09.517]  The problem is I probably work too much and then the quality goes down.
[02:01:10.318 --> 02:01:12.399]  But this is not work, my friend.
[02:01:12.519 --> 02:01:14.260]  I hate these people something fierce.
[02:01:15.661 --> 02:01:16.642]  Great attitude.
[02:01:16.702 --> 02:01:18.723]  But I'm more here to talk to you, AJ.
[02:01:18.743 --> 02:01:19.464]  I want to talk to
[02:01:20.336 --> 02:01:21.078]  We're good to go.
[02:01:26.115 --> 02:01:35.561]  I have more disrespect for the people that have been informed of the information but are afraid to speak out than people in the zombies that have never even been exposed to it because they just don't know the information.
[02:01:35.721 --> 02:01:39.223]  Well, I mean, Newsweek admitted that the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[02:01:39.263 --> 02:01:39.683]  bases.
[02:01:40.164 --> 02:01:42.925]  And I've interviewed the embassy heads that say they were ordered to protect them.
[02:01:43.306 --> 02:01:44.727]  The underwear bomber was protected.
[02:01:44.767 --> 02:01:46.087]  It's all hiding in plain view.
[02:01:46.348 --> 02:01:48.229]  I'm not saying there aren't some Muslim terrorists.
[02:01:48.789 --> 02:01:50.790]  My point is, is that they work for NATO.
[02:01:52.912 --> 02:01:53.392]  Absolutely.
[02:01:54.386 --> 02:02:15.259]  Uh, what I've personally done to try to, uh, awaken people, which I call awakening pamphlets, I've, uh, went online and bought some refill Monopoly money, um, pretty cheap, and just put a little flyer on the back of it, uh, asking people to please watch certain YouTube movies such as, uh, Loose Change, Final Cut, 9-11, uh, Truth, Hollywood Speaks Out, Obama's Inception, and, uh, just hand them out to people that I feel need to be awakened.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:21.984]  Um, I do frequently hand them out to police officers, you know, and I have a little conversation, I'm like, have you heard of, uh, this Obama Inception?
[02:02:22.244 --> 02:02:23.745]  Uh, supposedly the guy that fired
[02:02:24.198 --> 02:02:24.478]  I think so.
[02:02:42.116 --> 02:02:46.138]  Maybe if I see you at this coffee shop again or at the grocery store again, tell me what you think.
[02:02:47.478 --> 02:02:48.879]  Or give them your own little business card.
[02:02:48.899 --> 02:02:51.340]  Give yourself an organization name.
[02:02:53.201 --> 02:02:54.301]  Whatever the name of your town is.
[02:02:55.662 --> 02:02:57.322]  Happyville for Freedom or whatever.
[02:02:57.823 --> 02:02:59.143]  Or Austinites for Liberty.
[02:02:59.563 --> 02:03:03.525]  Give them the card with a little blog or website or Facebook on it.
[02:03:03.965 --> 02:03:05.146]  Give them a free DVD.
[02:03:05.186 --> 02:03:07.427]  Give them some info and say, hey, contact me.
[02:03:07.447 --> 02:03:08.127]  Tell me what you think.
[02:03:09.261 --> 02:03:09.781]  God bless you.
[02:03:09.801 --> 02:03:10.562]  Good to hear from you.
[02:03:10.862 --> 02:03:12.403]  Let's go ahead and go to Jay in New York.
[02:03:12.463 --> 02:03:13.304]  Jay, you're on the air.
[02:03:14.484 --> 02:03:14.804]  Hello?
[02:03:15.245 --> 02:03:15.585]  Hey, buddy.
[02:03:15.765 --> 02:03:15.985]  Hello.
[02:03:17.026 --> 02:03:17.246]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:17.326 --> 02:03:17.586]  Alex?
[02:03:17.966 --> 02:03:18.126]  Yep.
[02:03:18.146 --> 02:03:18.347]  Hi.
[02:03:19.087 --> 02:03:20.808]  Wow, you really don't censor anything.
[02:03:21.529 --> 02:03:22.529]  What do you mean?
[02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.630]  What do you mean?
[02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:29.433]  Well, people lie and say all my calls are fake and we screen them, but as you notice, we don't screen them, but go ahead.
[02:03:30.434 --> 02:03:35.557]  My real concern is about this chemtrails and stuff.
[02:03:35.597 --> 02:03:38.219]  My friend found out about this not too long ago.
[02:03:39.858 --> 02:03:46.322]  And he just freaked out and he's just like putting himself in the house, not even coming out and stuff like that.
[02:03:46.723 --> 02:03:47.683]  No, that's silly.
[02:03:47.703 --> 02:03:51.426]  You're not going to get away from the aluminum dioxide, barium salts and other things that way.
[02:03:51.446 --> 02:03:55.989]  It's all part of a giant admitted terra-farming geoengineering program.
[02:03:56.969 --> 02:03:58.210]  And so it's ongoing.
[02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:59.451]  You can't hide in the house from it.
[02:04:00.772 --> 02:04:07.276]  One of the things also that I recognized recently is that when I'm actually sleeping at night, I'm hearing this humming noise.
[02:04:07.436 --> 02:04:08.037]  What is that?
[02:04:08.117 --> 02:04:08.477]  Do you know?
[02:04:09.861 --> 02:04:16.105]  Well, there was the Kokomo Hum in Indiana that ABC News reported on about 15 years ago.
[02:04:16.845 --> 02:04:25.890]  It's been associated a lot of times with government underground tunneling, where they're building railways that will cause a vibrational hum.
[02:04:26.411 --> 02:04:30.553]  There's also earthquakes and things that happen super deep that can cause hums.
[02:04:31.053 --> 02:04:36.677]  Or it could be a transformer or a piece of equipment nearby that's oscillating with your roof or something in your home.
[02:04:38.198 --> 02:04:51.815]  And DARPA does admit, and this must give the schizophrenics nightmares, that they have developed systems that go on top cell towers that can affect people's moods, and they're testing these psychotronic weapons on the public.
[02:04:52.596 --> 02:04:55.960]  The fact that they're testing them is admitted, but the details are classified.
[02:04:58.925 --> 02:05:04.286]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:05.567 --> 02:05:10.328]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:10.708 --> 02:05:17.510]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:21.731]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:23.511 --> 02:05:25.772]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:27.793 --> 02:05:31.795]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:05:32.515 --> 02:05:35.656]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:05:36.357 --> 02:05:37.177]  Others don't.
[02:05:37.597 --> 02:05:39.478]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:39.738 --> 02:05:41.239]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:41.519 --> 02:05:44.080]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:50.663]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:51.023 --> 02:05:53.244]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:53.724 --> 02:05:55.765]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:05:56.105 --> 02:05:56.966]  Others don't.
[02:05:59.281 --> 02:06:00.803]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:01.003 --> 02:06:06.028]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:06:06.308 --> 02:06:07.669]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:16.638]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:06:17.359 --> 02:06:24.464]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:06:24.904 --> 02:06:32.509]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:32.909 --> 02:06:40.293]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:06:43.075 --> 02:06:45.998]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:06:46.278 --> 02:06:48.500]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:50.782]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:06:57.890 --> 02:07:04.873]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:07:05.113 --> 02:07:22.742]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:07:23.002 --> 02:07:27.104]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:07:27.384 --> 02:07:28.965]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:07:29.165 --> 02:07:37.011]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:07:37.311 --> 02:07:43.435]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:07:43.635 --> 02:07:44.676]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:07:44.916 --> 02:07:45.656]  It's incredible.
[02:07:45.796 --> 02:07:54.822]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:07:55.003 --> 02:07:56.844]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:07:59.986 --> 02:08:06.012]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:06.612 --> 02:08:09.655]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.318 --> 02:08:14.159]  Well, there is a plethora
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:21.427]  A cornucopia, a wide spectrum of issues I want to discuss with Max Keiser.
[02:08:22.128 --> 02:08:28.296]  He's a filmmaker, broadcaster, TV host, inventor of virtual specialist technology, Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[02:08:29.517 --> 02:08:32.678]  And we really appreciate him joining us here today.
[02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:34.939]  MaxKaiser.com is his website.
[02:08:35.359 --> 02:08:36.460]  MaxKaiser.com.
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:42.722]  And again, our websites are InfoWars.com and InfoWarsNews.com, as well as PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:42.762 --> 02:08:45.523]  And remember, the globalists are coming in more and more.
[02:08:46.043 --> 02:08:50.445]  I've got stacks of it today, calling for total censorship, total surveillance.
[02:08:51.245 --> 02:08:57.208]  They're now saying they're going to shut down your website separate from SOPA with this ACTA,
[02:08:58.254 --> 02:09:09.118]  This global treaty, if someone claims trademark or, I'm going to go to Max here in a moment, trademark or copyright just claims it.
[02:09:10.798 --> 02:09:20.942]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I got a letter two years ago from Taser International out of Scottsdale, Arizona, saying, do not use the word Taser in your articles.
[02:09:21.082 --> 02:09:24.603]  It is a trademark and copyrighted.
[02:09:24.623 --> 02:09:27.404]  I called the lawyer up and I said, you think I'm stupid?
[02:09:28.755 --> 02:09:32.997]  I said, I know this is part of the English language and is a news article under the First Amendment.
[02:09:33.617 --> 02:09:35.678]  I said, I'm not selling products under the name Taser.
[02:09:35.998 --> 02:09:37.759]  And I said, don't try to slap with me.
[02:09:37.799 --> 02:09:39.699]  And he went, oh, just disregard that.
[02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:41.240]  We send out thousands of those.
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:42.681]  Thousands?
[02:09:43.441 --> 02:09:44.281]  You do, huh?
[02:09:44.942 --> 02:09:51.464]  Well, I got a new one yesterday threatening us to not use, but you know what?
[02:09:51.584 --> 02:09:52.945]  I'm going to wait till I talk about it.
[02:09:53.609 --> 02:09:56.831]  Because they're threatening us and stuff and saying that they have this right.
[02:09:58.291 --> 02:10:01.513]  It's not a battle I want to take on, but I'll definitely take it on if I have to.
[02:10:01.873 --> 02:10:03.414]  They want to kill the language.
[02:10:03.754 --> 02:10:09.858]  Remember they were going to get a trademark on the word SEAL Team 6, Disney was, and then no one could use SEAL Team 6.
[02:10:11.923 --> 02:10:13.284]  And you're like, but that's the language.
[02:10:13.785 --> 02:10:17.229]  This is how they're inverting private property rights.
[02:10:17.289 --> 02:10:23.655]  The big globalists steal real property, like Max Keiser's virtual trading system, and don't pay him a dime.
[02:10:23.856 --> 02:10:26.198]  But then when you try to use English, they come after you.
[02:10:26.238 --> 02:10:26.839]  Side issue.
[02:10:27.179 --> 02:10:30.583]  The reason I'm plugging the website says, you better appreciate them.
[02:10:30.903 --> 02:10:34.547]  I don't talk about half the stuff, even less than half the stuff that goes on around here.
[02:10:35.461 --> 02:10:36.602]  The stuff we've already gone through.
[02:10:36.843 --> 02:10:38.044]  They're coming for the web.
[02:10:38.084 --> 02:10:40.287]  You better use Infowars.com now.
[02:10:40.547 --> 02:10:46.575]  You better appreciate the articles like Holdren at Science Budget Briefing.
[02:10:48.077 --> 02:10:52.422]  Leaner and meaner despite $2.6 billion for global change research.
[02:10:53.348 --> 02:10:53.788]  Another one.
[02:10:54.489 --> 02:10:55.790]  No one but Ron Paul.
[02:10:55.890 --> 02:10:56.411]  Money bomb.
[02:10:56.511 --> 02:10:57.612]  Aims to raise $3 million.
[02:10:57.872 --> 02:10:58.393]  Here's another one.
[02:10:58.853 --> 02:11:04.658]  Navy SEALs say false flag to be blamed on Iran may happen at any time.
[02:11:04.678 --> 02:11:06.480]  I think that's a pretty big article.
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:13.206]  A TSA forces woman to use naked body scanner three times because she's cute.
[02:11:14.547 --> 02:11:15.027]  They tell her.
[02:11:15.668 --> 02:11:19.871]  Obama's CFR Economic Council director calls for global tax.
[02:11:20.711 --> 02:11:22.652]  That might be something you might be concerned about.
[02:11:23.292 --> 02:11:27.553]  New World Trade Center site to become military-grade police state hub.
[02:11:28.273 --> 02:11:31.354]  Russian army chief decision on attacking Iran to be made by summer.
[02:11:32.134 --> 02:11:32.974]  It just goes on and on.
[02:11:33.375 --> 02:11:35.595]  I mean it is all cuckoo land.
[02:11:36.716 --> 02:11:46.038]  All over the country from New York City to Chicago to LA they're stopping people and doing frisk with no due process or stopping people on the streets and frisking them.
[02:11:46.318 --> 02:11:48.259]  What the TSA is beta testing
[02:11:49.079 --> 02:11:50.600]  Police are going, I can do that too?
[02:11:52.781 --> 02:11:53.741]  It's crazy.
[02:11:54.161 --> 02:11:56.322]  Now, I want to get Max Keiser on about everything.
[02:11:56.663 --> 02:12:09.729]  I want to talk about the economy, about the latest on MF Global, about the global meltdown, about Moody's devaluing a whole bunch of European countries again, when it's Moody's that works for the big banks that sold everybody the garbage, who are really insolvent.
[02:12:11.681 --> 02:12:12.682]  First of all, what is a psychotronic weapon?
[02:12:12.702 --> 02:12:13.382]  That's what I want to know.
[02:12:39.871 --> 02:12:47.536]  It's just electronic, ultra-low frequency, high frequency, different combinations that can make you sick, make you happy, make you aroused.
[02:12:48.257 --> 02:12:50.498]  They've had them for more than 60 years.
[02:12:51.659 --> 02:12:53.921]  Different wavelengths that affect brain chemistry.
[02:12:54.929 --> 02:13:02.434]  Yeah, because I know they have those laser sound now, where they can pinpoint an individual with a sound from a hundred yards away.
[02:13:02.454 --> 02:13:04.215]  It projects into the middle ear, yes.
[02:13:06.076 --> 02:13:07.677]  That's a patent in the 40s, yes.
[02:13:07.717 --> 02:13:12.480]  They have that, but now they're moving just to frequencies that are broadcast through the cell towers.
[02:13:12.841 --> 02:13:17.644]  On record, DARPA admits this, that can affect mood, but details remain classified, Max.
[02:13:17.864 --> 02:13:22.987]  Kind of like the White House science arm admits there's spraying stuff in the air, but details are classified, Max.
[02:13:23.247 --> 02:13:24.148]  You don't need to know about that.
[02:13:25.410 --> 02:13:44.284]  Oh, did you see that in the United Kingdom that somebody, there was a case with the Rothschilds where somebody called the Rothschilds a puppet master and the courts in the UK said this is not libelous, that in fact the Rothschilds, you can call them puppet master.
[02:13:44.484 --> 02:13:46.926]  This was just broken in the UK press like two days ago.
[02:13:46.946 --> 02:13:48.047]  You probably already covered it.
[02:13:48.704 --> 02:13:57.528]  You know, I did mention it, but it was Daily Mail got sued by him and the head Rothschild said, I don't meet with oligarchs, I don't control Russian oligarchs.
[02:13:57.988 --> 02:14:07.472]  Even though, as you know, it'd come out that whenever they would bust an oligarch, Putin would, they would learn that the billions of dollars were really belong to the Rothschilds and the guy was a front.
[02:14:07.812 --> 02:14:09.973]  I mean, I remember that in a bunch of news articles.
[02:14:10.293 --> 02:14:16.136]  And so I know that the paper won the suit and has now found photos of him actually over in Russia with them.
[02:14:16.894 --> 02:14:29.683]  Yeah, so, um, Stacey, of course, uh, my, um, my companion, girlfriend, and Valentine Day lover, uh, immediately said, oh, there Alex Jones is right again!
[02:14:29.703 --> 02:14:36.107]  I wish I wasn't right, I wish you weren't right, the NDA, all of it, Max.
[02:14:36.368 --> 02:14:40.991]  Well, what do you make of that, of him going, I don't run anything, I don't have any power, look over there!
[02:14:43.900 --> 02:14:46.843]  Well, I tell you, you ask me what's on my mind these days.
[02:14:46.863 --> 02:14:52.768]  I mean, I think the MF Global story is an important change, a sea change.
[02:14:52.788 --> 02:14:57.312]  It's the end of one era and the beginning of a new era.
[02:14:58.353 --> 02:15:03.537]  Nobody questions, nobody doubts now that what happened was that
[02:15:04.478 --> 02:15:12.341]  A bank, a bank in this case, JP Morgan, simply went into customers' accounts and took over a billion dollars.
[02:15:12.541 --> 02:15:21.365]  And this is, I think that we have to understand now that the hope of reforming the banking system in some way is over.
[02:15:21.485 --> 02:15:24.006]  You know, that battle is now lost.
[02:15:24.086 --> 02:15:25.027]  We lost that battle.
[02:15:25.367 --> 02:15:29.849]  Because there's no investigation, there's no anything going on.
[02:15:31.349 --> 02:15:33.830]  Is the beginning of a new era.
[02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:39.432]  These bankers can just reach in and take money without even anyone questioning it.
[02:15:39.512 --> 02:15:44.715]  So I'm focusing now actually on copyright as in Hollywood and the SOPA and ACTA.
[02:15:45.195 --> 02:15:50.617]  I'm going to focus less on banks and bank criminals because I just think that's over now.
[02:15:50.657 --> 02:15:51.357]  We lost.
[02:15:51.377 --> 02:15:55.719]  The MF Global signifies the end of any hope of any reform.
[02:15:56.159 --> 02:15:59.505]  It signals divine right of international bankers instead of kings.
[02:16:00.406 --> 02:16:05.514]  If they want to take your money and then get caught lying to Congress, they're going to do it.
[02:16:05.875 --> 02:16:07.377]  Here's the headline of the London Telegraph.
[02:16:07.698 --> 02:16:10.582]  Nathaniel Rothschild loses high court libel battle.
[02:16:11.363 --> 02:16:23.611]  And it says Nathaniel Rothschild, the billionaire financier, has lost a high court libel action over a claim that he was the puppet master behind the deal involving Lord Mandelson and a Russian oligarch.
[02:16:23.931 --> 02:16:31.136]  And of course it all went to pot when he said that he'd never met with these people and the photos and videos got released of them all in meetings in Russia.
[02:16:34.972 --> 02:16:35.572]  So there you go.
[02:16:35.632 --> 02:16:44.178]  So that now can be the so-called conspiracy theory relating to that family is now a conspiracy fact.
[02:16:44.878 --> 02:16:51.523]  And again, you know, the Alex Jones is always six months ahead of everybody else or two years ahead of everyone else.
[02:16:52.964 --> 02:16:54.424]  So I think that the SOPA
[02:16:55.365 --> 02:17:04.968]  And ACT-A battles can be won because with people like Anonymous on the web and others, they're really winning battles.
[02:17:04.988 --> 02:17:12.731]  You know, with the SOPA battles... What would you do if you got a letter threatening to sue you from a major publisher saying you can no longer use the word dummies?
[02:17:13.651 --> 02:17:16.412]  Well, you know, Facebook is trying to trademark the word face.
[02:17:17.968 --> 02:17:19.950]  To give you an idea of how crazy this is getting.
[02:17:19.970 --> 02:17:22.992]  Yeah, in fact, News Corp, didn't they sue Skype?
[02:17:23.012 --> 02:17:24.954]  Because it has the word sky in it.
[02:17:25.454 --> 02:17:28.256]  I mean, now it's like pick a word out of another word.
[02:17:28.276 --> 02:17:30.238]  I mean, it's just reached cartoon level.
[02:17:30.948 --> 02:17:33.269]  They wanted to trademark fair and balanced.
[02:17:33.369 --> 02:17:45.555]  And of course, Murdoch, not only was he caught spying on people, which is now a huge scandal, but now there's another huge scandal in the Murdoch press about police bribing.
[02:17:45.796 --> 02:17:48.457]  So, you know, Rupert Murdoch, who's the mainstream media,
[02:17:48.917 --> 02:17:54.422]  Not only is he a horrible lawbreaker, but he's a horrible businessman.
[02:17:54.682 --> 02:17:56.604]  You know, he sold MySpace.
[02:17:56.644 --> 02:18:05.132]  He bought MySpace for $500 million, sold it for $34 million to a group of investors, including some young musicians.
[02:18:05.512 --> 02:18:08.335]  Now it's signing up 40,000 people a day.
[02:18:08.375 --> 02:18:09.476]  It's becoming a hit, big hit.
[02:18:09.816 --> 02:18:19.279]  Again, Rupert Murdoch is a horrible businessman, but that's the kind of people who have incredible power because they use the power of the press, the mainstream media, to influence political outcomes.
[02:18:19.299 --> 02:18:29.523]  You know, Tony Blair was beholden to Murdoch, Bill Clinton and the Bushes, and Obama's beholden to the mainstream media, and they use copyright as leverage.
[02:18:29.563 --> 02:18:31.063]  They use copyright as a weapon.
[02:18:31.103 --> 02:18:32.924]  They use it as a way to control people.
[02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:36.745]  I think this is a battle that can be won because the
[02:18:37.205 --> 02:18:43.578]  Hackers and the pirates and the anonymous group have always proven to be one step ahead.
[02:18:46.518 --> 02:18:58.830]  ...is when of course Wikipedia went dark for a day and suddenly people understood that there was an opposing force against this copyright legislation and they immediately backed out.
[02:18:58.890 --> 02:19:06.658]  Yeah, but even the trademark rule doesn't mean that a journalist or someone can't... I mean, if you trademark the word Titanic, I can still write about the Titanic.
[02:19:06.958 --> 02:19:09.300]  They're even claiming you can't even say the word
[02:19:09.881 --> 02:19:24.015]  That's like when McDonald's 15 years ago sued the McDonald's family of Scotland, who's royal, who owns a castle, because they had a castle farm and a castle pub that for a thousand years plus had sold beer and cheese.
[02:19:24.375 --> 02:19:26.958]  And they said you can't call it McDonald's pub!
[02:19:28.578 --> 02:19:45.684]  Yeah, or I just read that Warner Brothers is suing Disney over The Wizard of Oz because the book mentions red slippers and does not, and the movie does, and they can't make a remake because the book is on copyright and the movie is off, and it just goes back and forth.
[02:19:45.924 --> 02:19:57.428]  They're using copyright, as you point out, to control language in an insidious manner that's creeping into our civil liberties in a way that's completely unconscionable.
[02:19:57.588 --> 02:19:58.709]  We'll be back, absolutely.
[02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:21.430]  Wealth, longevity, and freedom.
[02:20:21.630 --> 02:20:28.855]  This low-cost business opportunity is designed for full-time or part-time so you can work as little or as much as you'd like.
[02:20:29.135 --> 02:20:31.396]  It is you that defines the reward level.
[02:20:31.536 --> 02:20:38.460]  Whether you are seeking a few hundred extra dollars per month or a six or even seven figure annual income, it's up to you.
[02:20:38.701 --> 02:20:39.621]  Want to find out more?
[02:20:39.741 --> 02:20:46.125]  Shoot an email with InfoWars Team in the subject line to InfoWars Team Coordinator, MZ, and tell him a little bit about yourself.
[02:20:46.365 --> 02:20:49.109]  That's the initials MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[02:20:49.129 --> 02:20:51.552]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[02:20:51.753 --> 02:20:55.458]  I only promote products that I truly believe in, and these are phenomenal.
[02:20:55.518 --> 02:20:58.002]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[02:21:01.735 --> 02:21:06.478]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:21:06.918 --> 02:21:08.639]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:21:08.779 --> 02:21:11.961]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[02:21:12.302 --> 02:21:19.486]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:21:19.786 --> 02:21:23.989]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:21:24.289 --> 02:21:30.033]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:21:30.353 --> 02:21:31.934]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:21:32.155 --> 02:21:38.480]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:47.487]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[02:21:47.788 --> 02:21:53.232]  Call 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[02:21:53.512 --> 02:21:56.455]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[02:21:58.638 --> 02:22:04.002]  If you're having any problems with the IRS or a local revenue agency, I understand and I can help.
[02:22:04.683 --> 02:22:06.164]  I'm tax attorney Tony Dennison.
[02:22:06.584 --> 02:22:11.208]  When I was a kid, the IRS came after my mother's house because of mistaken information.
[02:22:11.648 --> 02:22:16.492]  Ever since then, I've dedicated my life to defending people in trouble with the IRS.
[02:22:16.872 --> 02:22:25.479]  I'm a real tax attorney, which means I have two law degrees, a standard law degree known as a JD, and a tax law degree known as a Masters of the Laws in Taxation.
[02:22:25.999 --> 02:22:30.521]  I've been practicing for 10 years and I've helped many of your fellow citizens in tax trouble.
[02:22:31.162 --> 02:22:36.444]  If you're in tax trouble, you don't need to be alone and you don't need to call one of those fake lawyer clearinghouses.
[02:22:36.964 --> 02:22:45.528]  Call me, Tony Denison, at Denison Tax Law, 952-886-7141 or on the web at denisontaxlaw.com.
[02:22:45.909 --> 02:22:47.469]  It may be the best call you make all year.
[02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:48.830]  Denison Tax Law, 952-886-7141.
[02:22:53.152 --> 02:22:56.794]  And again, on the web at denisontaxlaw.com.
[02:22:57.775 --> 02:23:02.858]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[02:23:03.158 --> 02:23:09.402]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes!
[02:23:09.563 --> 02:23:13.265]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now!
[02:23:14.386 --> 02:23:17.948]  123survivalplan.com has set up a for patriots only video,
[02:23:18.388 --> 02:23:23.770]  Inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.
[02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:32.913]  The video on 123survivalplan.com has crucial information you and your family need to prepare for any disaster, natural or man-made.
[02:23:33.233 --> 02:23:37.915]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry or being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.
[02:23:38.115 --> 02:23:43.258]  See the video that over one million other smart patriots have already seen in the last four months.
[02:23:43.518 --> 02:23:44.439]  Prepare now.
[02:23:44.779 --> 02:23:50.442]  Go to 123survivalplan.com and learn which 37 food items you should hoard.
[02:23:50.642 --> 02:23:51.403]  Easy to remember.
[02:23:51.423 --> 02:23:52.023]  123survivalplan.com.
[02:23:52.043 --> 02:23:53.764]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:12.585]  Okay, I want to get back with Max Keiser into this open globalist assault on free speech.
[02:24:12.605 --> 02:24:14.167]  You got Twitter, Facebook, Google.
[02:24:14.767 --> 02:24:21.214]  Every day I see three or four articles, I know you're seeing them as well, where they say, oh, we're going to comply with this government or that.
[02:24:21.794 --> 02:24:25.998]  If people are saying where speed traps are on Twitter, we're going to block them.
[02:24:28.448 --> 02:24:33.173]  If people are criticizing the Indonesian government, we're going to ban them.
[02:24:33.253 --> 02:24:36.055]  Yeah, Google's going to take down or block videos that the U.S.
[02:24:36.095 --> 02:24:38.478]  government says are critical of the government.
[02:24:39.038 --> 02:24:48.447]  And now documents have come out that Big Sis is spying on the Drugs Report and others to attract people that are criticizing the government because that hurts their capability to protect us.
[02:24:48.988 --> 02:24:50.589]  We've got to enslave you to protect you.
[02:24:50.609 --> 02:24:53.332]  I want to get back into that, Max, but in this short segment,
[02:24:54.352 --> 02:24:55.673]  What does it signify?
[02:24:55.973 --> 02:24:57.073]  Because this was my concern.
[02:24:57.794 --> 02:25:00.515]  If they can now say at MF Global, we're going to go ahead and keep your money.
[02:25:00.996 --> 02:25:01.836]  Yes, it's illegal.
[02:25:02.877 --> 02:25:04.397]  And yes, we did lie.
[02:25:04.818 --> 02:25:12.662]  And the head of the CF, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, comes out and says, Corzine lied.
[02:25:14.165 --> 02:25:15.266]  I don't know.
[02:25:34.905 --> 02:25:35.465]  I don't
[02:25:53.072 --> 02:25:57.095]  The manager would come around and say, break any law you want.
[02:25:57.155 --> 02:25:58.116]  We got lawyers.
[02:25:58.616 --> 02:26:05.121]  As a matter of fact, unless you had at least one client suing you, you weren't considered to be showing enough initiative.
[02:26:05.781 --> 02:26:14.688]  Because the entire industry was set up that any complaints went to binding arbitration before a panel of brokers and bankers.
[02:26:14.728 --> 02:26:15.869]  You do not go to a jury.
[02:26:16.650 --> 02:26:19.011]  But that mentality has gone global.
[02:26:19.372 --> 02:26:22.474]  And it's gone into a multi-hundred billion dollar
[02:26:23.069 --> 02:26:23.449]  Thank you.
[02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:48.838]  Debt that they themselves had nothing to do to incur.
[02:26:49.058 --> 02:26:53.761]  The Greek people did not create 500 billion dollars of debt.
[02:26:54.661 --> 02:26:57.683]  That debt was passed to them through their governments from foreign banks.
[02:26:57.923 --> 02:26:59.444]  The same thing's happening in the U.S.
[02:26:59.544 --> 02:27:01.425]  as you know, the same thing happening all over the world.
[02:27:01.805 --> 02:27:04.426]  But there's no, absolutely no recourse.
[02:27:04.727 --> 02:27:06.227]  There's no rule.
[02:27:06.407 --> 02:27:12.911]  There's no, no body, no jurisdiction that is making any case
[02:27:13.511 --> 02:27:23.023]  I don't want to pull the Nazi card because it's overly done, but you have to really go back to the 1930s and see what was done in Germany to folks.
[02:27:32.254 --> 02:27:33.534]  And it was all legal, of course.
[02:27:33.554 --> 02:27:36.255]  This is what you hear all the time, Alex, from the mainstream media.
[02:27:37.095 --> 02:27:38.636]  And Obama says the same thing.
[02:27:38.816 --> 02:27:40.456]  He says, it's all legal.
[02:27:40.756 --> 02:27:42.316]  What they did was all legal.
[02:27:42.636 --> 02:27:45.197]  Yes, what Hitler did was all legal too, Alex.
[02:27:45.957 --> 02:27:53.679]  He passed the laws to make it legal to confiscate wealth and to put people into a ghetto and to cremate them.
[02:27:53.979 --> 02:28:01.765]  What's happening in Greece right now is we're heading toward a financial holocaust and those people are going to end up with the same final solution.
[02:28:02.245 --> 02:28:10.431]  And the bankers at Davos will say, well this is great because this is the deflation we need to offset the inflation of all our money printing.
[02:28:10.791 --> 02:28:16.176]  We'll offset our inflation by incinerating a few thousand people, or a million people.
[02:28:16.637 --> 02:28:18.999]  It's the exact same mentality.
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:21.362]  The exact same playbook.
[02:28:21.822 --> 02:28:23.143]  It's happening again.
[02:28:23.684 --> 02:28:25.306]  And there's nobody standing up to it.
[02:28:25.526 --> 02:28:31.291]  And of course if, in the case of, let's say, and you make this point all the time, in the United States of course,
[02:28:32.293 --> 02:28:47.914]  If it's not the Super Bowl one weekend, or the Academy Awards the next weekend, or, you know, mass sopping over the death of Whitney Houston on any given day, there's no space in the nightly news other than your news.
[02:28:48.354 --> 02:28:56.779]  Where people are talking about the fact that there is a holocaust, a financial holocaust, happening in Greece right now.
[02:28:57.139 --> 02:28:58.220]  That's not discussed.
[02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:04.524]  So that means that the people in the United States who don't talk about this are, by extension, participating in it.
[02:29:04.944 --> 02:29:07.566]  But they are ameliorated with
[02:29:08.246 --> 02:29:14.770]  The entertainment value, and the ultra-cheap food, and the ultra-cheap energy that's still available in the U.S.
[02:29:15.151 --> 02:29:17.252]  And so then, it's just not talked about.
[02:29:17.292 --> 02:29:26.699]  But as I said, I think we're in a new era now, because there's absolutely no, um, no, no, no pushback at all against the GameStop.
[02:29:26.719 --> 02:29:30.741]  And that's my next question when we come back, and then get into other news and go to calls, Max Keiser.
[02:29:31.342 --> 02:29:32.502]  What's coming next?
[02:29:32.562 --> 02:29:34.324]  I mean, if they can get away with anything.
[02:29:34.964 --> 02:29:36.484]  Sticking their hands down our pants.
[02:29:37.025 --> 02:29:38.325]  Stealing our bank accounts.
[02:29:38.825 --> 02:29:39.865]  Lying to Congress.
[02:29:40.225 --> 02:29:42.626]  Shipping guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:29:43.326 --> 02:29:44.907]  Putting toxic poison in the water.
[02:29:46.047 --> 02:29:47.007]  What's coming next?
[02:29:47.687 --> 02:29:48.587]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.088 --> 02:29:50.688]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.628 --> 02:29:54.289]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.669 --> 02:30:01.311]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[02:30:01.611 --> 02:30:05.093]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[02:30:05.293 --> 02:30:05.774]  Number 10.
[02:30:05.814 --> 02:30:08.095]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[02:30:08.356 --> 02:30:08.576]  Number 9.
[02:30:09.096 --> 02:30:10.917]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[02:30:10.937 --> 02:30:14.219]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:14.219]  7.
[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:16.601]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[02:30:16.641 --> 02:30:16.601]  6.
[02:30:16.661 --> 02:30:20.344]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[02:30:21.404 --> 02:30:24.287]  I always have access to high-quality and delicious food.
[02:30:24.587 --> 02:30:28.330]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[02:30:28.570 --> 02:30:31.652]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[02:30:31.953 --> 02:30:36.076]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[02:30:36.256 --> 02:30:42.121]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[02:30:42.481 --> 02:30:43.242]  Folks, don't wait.
[02:30:43.422 --> 02:30:44.603]  Get prepared now.
[02:30:44.663 --> 02:30:46.344]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[02:30:46.624 --> 02:30:49.186]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[02:30:49.206 --> 02:30:51.608]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:30:58.103 --> 02:31:02.325]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:02.645 --> 02:31:02.926]  Number 1.
[02:31:03.566 --> 02:31:06.708]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:06.988 --> 02:31:07.548]  Number 2.
[02:31:07.848 --> 02:31:12.391]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:12.731 --> 02:31:13.171]  It's true.
[02:31:13.471 --> 02:31:18.034]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:18.354 --> 02:31:18.874]  Number 3.
[02:31:19.174 --> 02:31:22.456]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:22.756 --> 02:31:26.438]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:26.658 --> 02:31:27.219]  Number 4.
[02:31:27.459 --> 02:31:29.822]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:30.223 --> 02:31:33.607]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:33.907 --> 02:31:34.108]  Number 5.
[02:31:34.688 --> 02:31:38.613]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:38.854 --> 02:31:43.620]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:47.901]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:48.062 --> 02:31:49.622]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:49.842 --> 02:31:51.923]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:52.103 --> 02:31:54.424]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:59.827 --> 02:32:03.448]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:03.788 --> 02:32:11.889]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:32:12.649 --> 02:32:16.670]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:28.092]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:32:28.712 --> 02:32:37.720]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:38.241 --> 02:32:43.285]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:32:43.666 --> 02:32:50.832]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:51.152 --> 02:32:53.915]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:33:20.085 --> 02:33:43.116]  is that I've done some basic studying of history and I've studied the corptocracy of kleptocrats that we have running things and they are definitely clinically ill from a case of megalomaniacal chutzpah.
[02:33:45.057 --> 02:33:46.859]  Megalomaniacal bravado.
[02:33:47.779 --> 02:33:49.741]  Megalomaniacal craziness.
[02:33:49.761 --> 02:33:51.642]  I mean, look at Corzine.
[02:33:51.943 --> 02:34:09.536]  40 to 1 bet, other people's money, lies before Congress, gets caught lying, and now the entire corporate media structure, the whole system is coming out and saying, we don't know where the money went.
[02:34:09.837 --> 02:34:12.439]  And as I pointed out three months ago when this all started,
[02:34:16.932 --> 02:34:20.995]  It was in Forbes, it was in the Associated Press that most of the money had been wired to London to J.P.
[02:34:21.035 --> 02:34:21.375]  Morgan.
[02:34:22.395 --> 02:34:23.376]  But then I guess J.P.
[02:34:23.396 --> 02:34:26.898]  Morgan said, hey, don't say it came to us, just say it's a mystery where it went.
[02:34:28.539 --> 02:34:38.806]  And so now everybody says we don't know where it went, and federal regulators are in the news, the financial news, every week saying, gee, we don't know where it is.
[02:34:40.185 --> 02:34:48.272]  Now, if you wire $1,000, there's a record of it, you wire $10,000, there is a criminal investigation opened, called a Suspicious Transactions Report.
[02:34:48.292 --> 02:34:52.776]  It's global rules, Homeland Security runs the whole thing worldwide, it's standardized.
[02:34:52.796 --> 02:34:56.699]  Because the globalists want to know where money is going so they can steal it.
[02:34:58.340 --> 02:35:00.502]  They only shut down the drug dealers, they want to shut down.
[02:35:00.542 --> 02:35:02.424]  They only shut down the money launderers, they want to shut down.
[02:35:03.766 --> 02:35:08.687]  Goldman Sachs, all these people that are involved taking over countries, they're conquerors.
[02:35:09.367 --> 02:35:11.828]  They're crooks, and that's what Max is talking about.
[02:35:12.628 --> 02:35:21.370]  And now, they're playing along like they don't know where the money went when it's public where it went, and the so-called media is playing along.
[02:35:22.250 --> 02:35:24.851]  I mean, Max, that's what's really frightening here.
[02:35:24.891 --> 02:35:26.711]  It's not just that the globalists are thieves.
[02:35:27.291 --> 02:35:30.552]  It's that, just like Caligula or Hitler or anybody,
[02:35:31.312 --> 02:35:40.781]  They get so arrogant they start going wild and always bring themselves down, but generally they bring tens of millions down with them.
[02:35:40.801 --> 02:35:42.763]  You know, demo side in the 20th century, Max.
[02:35:43.902 --> 02:35:51.005]  Killed more people than anything else, and it's an academic term, well-known in academia, but not ever on the news.
[02:35:51.725 --> 02:35:53.285]  Of course, that's death by government.
[02:35:53.745 --> 02:35:57.987]  They killed 264 million people last century, conservatively, Max.
[02:35:58.187 --> 02:36:00.808]  Not counting warfare, not counting troop casualties.
[02:36:02.889 --> 02:36:06.190]  With this type of insanity at this level, what's coming next?
[02:36:07.622 --> 02:36:29.551]  Well, just to be clear, again, the significance of the global story and my experience as a stock broker on Wall Street for many years, there was a barrier called segregated accounts that no lunatic who even was bent all the rules or broke all the rules, you would never go into a segregated customer account.
[02:36:29.691 --> 02:36:33.113]  It's heavily coded as such within the system.
[02:36:34.833 --> 02:36:43.496]  I mean, of all the crimes that we did, we did forgery all the time, we did all kinds of criminal behavior.
[02:36:43.516 --> 02:36:49.057]  I mean, every single stop, by definition, if you have your Series 7 license, you are a criminal.
[02:36:49.598 --> 02:36:52.759]  That's pretty much the business model of Wall Street.
[02:36:52.779 --> 02:37:00.621]  And I've told you some of the tricks that we used to use, look back trades and other things we used to use to just print money all day long.
[02:37:01.181 --> 02:37:21.353]  But when you go into the segregated account and just steal from a customer like that, that's a whole other dimension to this history of bank collapse and criminality that we've seen when the Lehman Brothers collapsed and the big TARP bailout that Hank Paulson engineered by threatening Congress with martial law.
[02:37:21.613 --> 02:37:22.994]  I mean, this is a new chapter.
[02:37:23.234 --> 02:37:30.278]  And it literally means that people's bank accounts and their brokerage accounts are not safe from the meddling
[02:37:30.658 --> 02:37:35.688]  Fingers of somebody who simply can reach in there and steal their money.
[02:37:35.989 --> 02:37:39.255]  And this is something that is just a new chapter.
[02:37:39.295 --> 02:37:41.359]  So I anybody who had a
[02:37:42.506 --> 02:37:46.608]  An escape plan, and I noticed I just saw a story on Reuters and I sent you the link.
[02:37:47.128 --> 02:37:50.169]  The number of people who are renouncing their U.S.
[02:37:50.249 --> 02:37:53.691]  citizenship in the last 12 months has skyrocketed.
[02:37:54.031 --> 02:38:01.494]  People are getting out of the U.S., they are renouncing their citizenship, and they're getting out of the United States.
[02:38:01.554 --> 02:38:03.475]  They don't trust the United States.
[02:38:03.855 --> 02:38:06.736]  Anyone with any means at all is leaving.
[02:38:07.096 --> 02:38:10.518]  The embassies are chock-a-block, they're stuffed with people
[02:38:11.178 --> 02:38:30.233]  trying to get to their exit interviews because in order to renounce your citizenship you have to go into the embassy or uh... you know an affiliated uh... institutional branch and you have to go through an exit interview and they then give you a certificate which formally you have renounced your citizenship and from that moment forward the U.S.
[02:38:30.493 --> 02:38:32.655]  is uh... no longer has claim to you.
[02:38:32.675 --> 02:38:38.400]  But the number of people at embassies around the world who are waiting to do this they can't handle the volume
[02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:45.265]  Anyone who's really got anything to protect realizes that when, for example, they shut down Switzerland.
[02:38:45.326 --> 02:38:45.646]  Why?
[02:38:46.006 --> 02:38:49.789]  Because those American banks wanted to get into the money laundering business.
[02:38:50.109 --> 02:38:53.092]  The American banks wanted to get into the secret bank account business.
[02:38:53.332 --> 02:38:58.416]  It's not that Switzerland was closed down as a place to launder money or hide money.
[02:38:58.496 --> 02:38:58.677]  No.
[02:38:58.977 --> 02:39:02.300]  The United States, the Wall Street banks, wanted that business for themselves.
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:04.842]  Well, more than that, Max, as you know, they admit
[02:39:05.562 --> 02:39:10.526]  And I was just playing a clip earlier about this global government they want to get all the little guys money.
[02:39:11.006 --> 02:39:14.468]  Somebody who put $20 million in over 30 years.
[02:39:14.789 --> 02:39:16.190]  That sounds like a lot to most people.
[02:39:16.230 --> 02:39:19.212]  That's nothing to a globalist who's stolen tens of billions.
[02:39:19.552 --> 02:39:21.473]  They want to rob all the little guys.
[02:39:21.533 --> 02:39:26.417]  And you notice when they have gone after Swiss banks, it's always, you know, for $2, $3, $5, $10 million.
[02:39:27.317 --> 02:39:28.858]  It's always just setting that precedent.
[02:39:30.129 --> 02:39:46.561]  Expanding on that, Max, and looking at this, I ran into some of the family, and after I met them and talked to them, I went and looked them up, it really was them, of John Wayne's kids, some of John Wayne's children, a famous actor.
[02:39:47.181 --> 02:39:52.946]  And they were leaving the United States and selling everything they had.
[02:39:52.986 --> 02:39:55.788]  They had a ranch outside Austin.
[02:39:56.829 --> 02:39:59.210]  And that was two years ago.
[02:39:59.230 --> 02:40:01.351]  They've now left the United States to Costa Rica.
[02:40:02.291 --> 02:40:09.194]  And I asked them why, and they said, because the government's going to raise taxes and rob everybody, and it's changing the rules, and all the money's leaving.
[02:40:09.634 --> 02:40:12.216]  And I've talked to a lady who is worth over $3 billion.
[02:40:13.914 --> 02:40:14.394]  I don't think so.
[02:40:39.404 --> 02:40:41.505]  But see, that's not like, oh great, I've been right.
[02:40:41.905 --> 02:40:43.346]  It's horrible news, Max.
[02:40:43.626 --> 02:40:46.587]  The money is running like they're scared to death.
[02:40:46.647 --> 02:40:47.448]  What are they scared of?
[02:40:48.028 --> 02:40:53.130]  Well, you know, first of all, it's not about taxes or raising taxes.
[02:40:53.391 --> 02:40:56.232]  It's more about what you see at the TSA now.
[02:40:56.572 --> 02:41:00.214]  We get reports all the time about TSA agents
[02:41:01.581 --> 02:41:05.504]  Just stealing money and shaking people down, basically, and stealing property.
[02:41:05.764 --> 02:41:08.146]  And this is now becoming endemic throughout the U.S.
[02:41:08.846 --> 02:41:11.708]  in every tier, right up to the level of J.P.
[02:41:11.748 --> 02:41:12.088]  Morgan.
[02:41:12.108 --> 02:41:13.990]  You know, Jamie Dimon, who runs J.P.
[02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:16.491]  Morgan, stealing money from MF Global clients.
[02:41:16.552 --> 02:41:21.315]  And by the way, that number, I just saw a report, was raised again to $1.6 billion that they say that they can't find.
[02:41:24.477 --> 02:41:35.201]  You know, it's an incredible economy where Walmart can tell you where a razor blade they sold three years ago is in a landfill somewhere with some of the RFID tag.
[02:41:35.521 --> 02:41:39.322]  But the major bank on Wall Street has misplaced $1.6 billion.
[02:41:39.482 --> 02:41:47.925]  I mean, that's an amazing admission in this day and age where everything is known by everyone on the corporation front and on Wall Street.
[02:41:48.285 --> 02:41:54.471]  But you've got, right up from the top, the Jamie Dimons of the world, right down to the TSA agent, they simply now steal.
[02:41:54.751 --> 02:41:56.373]  Stealing has become legitimized.
[02:41:56.393 --> 02:42:03.280]  You know, I've said, since I've been coming on your show, that the closest antecedent to what's happening in the U.S.
[02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:05.222]  has got to be Argentina, 2000-2001.
[02:42:05.602 --> 02:42:11.488]  And there's a brilliant 12-part series on YouTube, a documentary, where they show
[02:42:12.509 --> 02:42:20.035]  The rich loading up trucks, armored vehicles, and driving the money out of Buenos Aires.
[02:42:20.416 --> 02:42:23.878]  Leaving the people with nothing but pots and pans.
[02:42:24.439 --> 02:42:27.982]  And if you look what's happening in Greece, this is exactly what just happened in Greece.
[02:42:28.222 --> 02:42:33.186]  Those people had 400 billion dollars of their GDP stolen.
[02:42:33.506 --> 02:42:35.688]  They're sitting there with pots and pans now.
[02:42:35.748 --> 02:42:36.729]  They've got nothing.
[02:42:36.869 --> 02:42:47.194]  And it's not even their debt again, and they admit the megabanks that did it, that infiltrated their government, are now taking over the country and they're not going to be able to vote anymore.
[02:42:47.834 --> 02:42:50.696]  But look, in Argentina, that was the template.
[02:42:50.736 --> 02:42:55.918]  The debt was from Citibank, that the Argentinian government nationalized.
[02:42:56.259 --> 02:42:58.160]  And they passed a law, and of course it's all legal.
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:42:59.160]  This is what you always hear.
[02:42:59.500 --> 02:43:00.521]  It's completely legal.
[02:43:01.821 --> 02:43:06.742]  They nationalized all this foreign debt, and then they forced it onto the people in the terms of austerity.
[02:43:06.822 --> 02:43:07.522]  Same thing in Greece.
[02:43:07.762 --> 02:43:17.004]  Same thing in all of these situations where you find the IMF and the other Troika members meddling around, involved in these massive scams.
[02:43:17.084 --> 02:43:28.207]  And in the U.S., of course, now you see it happening with the TSA agent is a perfect metaphor for what's happening throughout the entire economy, right up to the CEO's office of the biggest banks in America.
[02:43:28.427 --> 02:43:30.949]  They simply steal your money.
[02:43:31.850 --> 02:43:43.241]  They're not doing some leveraged derivatives trade as a way to move risk from one balance sheet to another as keeping liquidity or making a market.
[02:43:43.361 --> 02:43:44.743]  No, none of that is happening.
[02:43:44.803 --> 02:43:45.844]  They're just stealing.
[02:43:46.605 --> 02:43:50.929]  And this has gone to the point where people now are renouncing their U.S.
[02:43:50.969 --> 02:43:53.492]  citizenship in record numbers.
[02:43:53.552 --> 02:43:56.935]  Since they started tracking this, the number has never been higher.
[02:43:56.955 --> 02:43:58.697]  It's up 200 or 300 percent from last year.
[02:43:58.717 --> 02:44:02.762]  And the lines and emphases around the world to renounce U.S.
[02:44:02.802 --> 02:44:04.704]  citizenship are growing every single day.
[02:44:06.706 --> 02:44:07.647]  How bad is it going to get?
[02:44:10.723 --> 02:44:13.065]  Well, I mean, in the U.S., the U.S.
[02:44:13.125 --> 02:44:21.012]  is in a very interesting position because it has been the chief beneficiary of these banking scandals for decades.
[02:44:21.072 --> 02:44:29.220]  And what I mean by that is that in the U.S., the price of energy and food is still, compared to other countries, very cheap.
[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:45.865]  So, somebody making $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 a year can actually have a reasonable life because the, you know, lifestyle even, because the cost of energy and food as compared with these other countries is still relatively cheap because the U.S.
[02:44:45.905 --> 02:44:49.046]  has a reserve currency and because so much of the U.S.
[02:44:49.066 --> 02:44:50.007]  economy is subsidized.
[02:44:50.047 --> 02:44:56.009]  You know, when the Republicans say they hate big government, that is a big joke because the economy of the U.S.
[02:44:56.189 --> 02:44:56.989]  is nothing but
[02:44:57.469 --> 02:44:59.951]  Underwritten and subsidized by big government.
[02:45:00.011 --> 02:45:01.072]  The agriculture industry.
[02:45:01.112 --> 02:45:06.696]  You talked about the Mexican Coca-Cola being sweeter than the American Coca-Cola and the high fructose corn syrup.
[02:45:06.716 --> 02:45:17.283]  That's because corn is subsidized by big government to the point where the price of corn is so cheap that they inject it into food into America.
[02:45:17.543 --> 02:45:24.428]  And 60% of every calorie you take in in the United States is from high frequency, high and high fructose corn syrup.
[02:45:25.028 --> 02:45:27.010]  Because of the underwriting that comes from the government.
[02:45:27.210 --> 02:45:35.292]  They just come in and lobby the corporations and the food makers to put it in there, basically giving it to them, and it's the same thing with fluoride in the water, everything.
[02:45:35.312 --> 02:45:38.253]  Special interests come in and make you do this.
[02:45:38.633 --> 02:45:42.094]  The price of food ends up being extraordinarily cheap.
[02:45:42.394 --> 02:45:49.136]  It's horrible for you, and you end up having to take supplements to survive, but the basic food at the fast food joint is incredibly cheap.
[02:45:49.236 --> 02:45:50.117]  Same thing for energy.
[02:45:50.257 --> 02:45:50.877]  Oil prices
[02:45:52.839 --> 02:45:57.844]  ...do not reflect the world market because America's got wars going on all over the world.
[02:45:58.125 --> 02:46:00.547]  The biggest buyer of gasoline is the Pentagon.
[02:46:00.808 --> 02:46:02.149]  They spend $230 million a day on gas.
[02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:18.519]  To gas up all those vehicles for the Pentagon, to go into all these countries and just kill shoot people indiscriminately because, for fun, $230 million a day they spend on gas.
[02:46:19.099 --> 02:46:31.509]  Okay, now to keep that flowing, they've got relationships with Saudi Arabia, which of course, then you open up that whole Mideast quandary, and you see how the propaganda comes out, and how we're targeting Iran,
[02:46:31.949 --> 02:46:38.378]  And why Siri is bad, but Bayran is good, and you know, you end up in this incredible quagmire.
[02:46:38.398 --> 02:46:45.027]  Let me raise that for you and then go to calls, Max, because that's the next issue I wanted to raise with you here today.
[02:46:45.047 --> 02:46:45.107]  Why
[02:46:49.562 --> 02:47:02.847]  Is the establishment so arrogant that they're openly putting Al Qaeda in charge in the areas of Syria they've invaded, Al Qaeda in charge of Libya, Al Qaeda now being put in everywhere, and the media admitting that the U.S.
[02:47:02.887 --> 02:47:04.968]  and Israel are using Al Qaeda terror groups?
[02:47:05.408 --> 02:47:07.469]  That was in NBC News a few nights ago.
[02:47:08.129 --> 02:47:09.150]  Like it's a good thing.
[02:47:09.430 --> 02:47:22.439]  Like I've got to have a pot-bellied pervert grab my genitals and try to grope my children at the airport and go after my wife because terrorists are everywhere, Al-Qaeda, but Al-Qaeda openly works for the government.
[02:47:22.719 --> 02:47:25.741]  But then I'm bad to say 9-11's an inside job.
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:31.742]  Well, the Al Qaeda worked for the government, you know, to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
[02:47:32.602 --> 02:47:35.103]  Bin Laden was on the, you know, working for the U.S.
[02:47:35.143 --> 02:47:36.824]  and then he wasn't working for the U.S.
[02:47:36.884 --> 02:47:39.225]  and now the Al Qaeda is working for the U.S.
[02:47:39.285 --> 02:47:41.305]  and the history of the U.S.
[02:47:41.325 --> 02:47:42.606]  foreign policy is like this.
[02:47:42.826 --> 02:47:44.066]  They flip and swap.
[02:47:44.146 --> 02:47:46.207]  There's no ideology behind it.
[02:47:46.387 --> 02:47:50.689]  It's simply an empire out there trying to get secure resources
[02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:53.470]  For the cheapest possible price.
[02:47:53.570 --> 02:47:55.911]  That's the whole methodology to it.
[02:47:55.931 --> 02:47:57.092]  There is no ideology.
[02:47:57.132 --> 02:48:00.113]  There is no democracy building.
[02:48:00.554 --> 02:48:01.534]  None of that happens.
[02:48:02.235 --> 02:48:04.416]  They've got drones destroying schools.
[02:48:04.436 --> 02:48:05.936]  They're not out there building schools.
[02:48:06.217 --> 02:48:07.677]  They're just out there securing oil.
[02:48:07.737 --> 02:48:12.300]  Because the price of oil in the U.S., even at $4 or $4.50 a gallon, is incredibly cheap compared to Europe.
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:13.800]  It's $12, $13, $14 a gallon now to buy gas in Paris.
[02:48:21.224 --> 02:48:26.527]  Because France doesn't have the Pentagon going around the world blowing people up for their oil reserves.
[02:48:26.927 --> 02:48:38.033]  So America's... So I'm saying, you know, America, this is what makes America very interesting is that even though they're getting screwed horribly, the average person still has cheap food, cheap gas, you know, they have a...
[02:48:39.754 --> 02:48:44.458]  They have a reasonably comfortable life, even at this late stage of the game.
[02:48:44.879 --> 02:48:45.659]  So the U.S.
[02:48:45.739 --> 02:48:51.845]  is not motivated, even though you can tell them how bad things are, the average person is still not feeling it.
[02:48:52.425 --> 02:48:56.188]  And this is what the guardians of this empire in Washington know.
[02:48:56.629 --> 02:49:02.314]  The guys, the neocons, the Rumsfelds, the Cheneys, they know that their job is to just get
[02:49:02.634 --> 02:49:19.782]  Resources as cheaply as possible to take the flack to take all the jibes and the sarcasm and to be portrayed as bad guys, but they they're they believe that they're doing the job of keeping the masses, you know in cheap oil and cheap food and and and they've done a job doing that now.
[02:49:20.463 --> 02:49:29.407]  Unfortunately, and what you're saying what I'm saying what Gerald Solente is saying and what other people are saying is that there reaches a point where
[02:49:30.027 --> 02:49:46.218]  There is, it can't sustain, it's unsustainable and that shift when suddenly the debt bomb that has blown up Greece and blown up other countries finally blows up the US economy and prices double and triple overnight.
[02:49:48.034 --> 02:49:52.797]  The very top, those people who orchestrated this whole campaign, they're going to be gone.
[02:49:52.837 --> 02:49:54.158]  They're not going to be in the United States.
[02:49:54.178 --> 02:49:55.239]  They're going to be living elsewhere.
[02:49:55.279 --> 02:49:56.260]  And there's the answer.
[02:49:56.300 --> 02:49:56.900]  There's the answer.
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:59.802]  We're going to do a few more segments of calls after the break, but you're right.
[02:49:59.882 --> 02:50:05.706]  That's why the rich are leaving, is because when they finally implode the U.S., they're going to totally implode it.
[02:50:06.366 --> 02:50:11.210]  And you're just going to leave us behind with a bunch of militarized police and TSA running around.
[02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:16.394]  And boy, I wouldn't want their jobs, because you're going to have 400 million guns and a bunch of angry people.
[02:50:17.716 --> 02:50:18.917]  It's going to be a mess, Max.
[02:50:20.963 --> 02:50:21.563]  Well, yeah.
[02:50:21.683 --> 02:50:43.144]  I mean, I believe that the timing is, you know, all the signs are there, but I also can understand why people are not motivated to get up and do anything right now, because they still have a reasonable lifestyle, and they still feel that the risk of losing their reasonable comfort level is not worth risking.
[02:50:43.785 --> 02:50:48.334]  They just don't know that by letting the New World Order come in, they're ensuring their destruction.
[02:50:48.614 --> 02:50:49.797]  But they'll find out soon enough.
[02:50:50.117 --> 02:50:53.003]  Call straight ahead with Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:50:58.641 --> 02:51:05.545]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[02:51:05.765 --> 02:51:23.236]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:51:23.496 --> 02:51:27.599]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:51:27.859 --> 02:51:29.419]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:51:29.599 --> 02:51:37.381]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:51:37.701 --> 02:51:43.722]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:51:43.942 --> 02:51:44.982]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:51:45.223 --> 02:51:45.963]  It's incredible.
[02:51:46.083 --> 02:51:55.024]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:51:55.205 --> 02:51:57.085]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:51:58.479 --> 02:52:01.522]  Will I have garlic breath after I take Ali-C?
[02:52:01.842 --> 02:52:05.865]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[02:52:06.186 --> 02:52:14.713]  And the answer is, Ali-C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[02:52:15.033 --> 02:52:22.019]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:52:22.299 --> 02:52:26.164]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[02:52:26.444 --> 02:52:30.268]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[02:52:30.548 --> 02:52:37.296]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal and viral infections, and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:52:37.436 --> 02:52:39.358]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[02:52:39.519 --> 02:52:42.442]  Boost resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.
[02:52:42.762 --> 02:52:48.089]  Ali C. For more information and to order Ali C., call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:52:48.129 --> 02:52:49.992]  That's 877-888-7126 or GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:52:50.012 --> 02:52:50.833]  Fight back with Ali C.
[02:52:58.022 --> 02:52:58.803]  IRS.
[02:52:59.163 --> 02:53:01.444]  The three most dreaded letters of the alphabet.
[02:53:01.724 --> 02:53:12.090]  If you owe back taxes, have unfiled tax returns, are receiving threatening letters, or have IRS agents coming to your home or place of business, you need an experienced IRS agent fighting on your side.
[02:53:12.270 --> 02:53:15.772]  Call the Tax Relief Division of the Law Offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-798-7085.
[02:53:18.453 --> 02:53:28.158]  Spearheaded by a former IRS agent, we know how to negotiate a reduction in the tax you owe, stop wage garnishments, lift bank levies, and negotiate an affordable repayment plan.
[02:53:28.318 --> 02:53:35.241]  With 17 years as a practicing attorney and an A-plus Better Business rating, we'll get the IRS off your back once and for all.
[02:53:35.421 --> 02:53:39.723]  In fact, recently, when an IRS employee had a tax problem, she called us.
[02:53:40.043 --> 02:53:43.504]  Stop being afraid and call right now for your free consultation at 800-798-7085.
[02:53:43.524 --> 02:53:45.085]  The phone call is free and there's no obligation, so call 800-798-7085.
[02:53:45.105 --> 02:53:45.425]  Again, that's 800-798-7085.
[02:53:45.545 --> 02:53:47.186]  Actual results based on individual client circumstances.
[02:54:07.369 --> 02:54:08.313]  Yeah.
[02:54:15.188 --> 02:54:21.130]  Folks, if you go to InfoWars.com, you can see our big article up there concerning Navy SEAL sources.
[02:54:21.651 --> 02:54:23.671]  They say the false flag is in the offing.
[02:54:23.711 --> 02:54:28.953]  That is big news, and they say warn people before it happens, because there's one thing these bankers love to pull.
[02:54:28.973 --> 02:54:31.334]  That's a war to grab even more power.
[02:54:31.354 --> 02:54:35.936]  Let's take a few calls in this short segment and the next with Max Keiser, our guest.
[02:54:36.516 --> 02:54:39.397]  Val in Montana, you're on the air with both of us.
[02:54:39.437 --> 02:54:39.758]  Welcome.
[02:54:41.578 --> 02:54:41.998]  Hi there.
[02:54:42.339 --> 02:54:43.099]  Thanks for the honor, Alex.
[02:54:44.326 --> 02:54:44.946]  Thank you, go ahead.
[02:55:15.191 --> 02:55:19.533]  Yeah, it's my term of endearment for them, among others.
[02:55:19.553 --> 02:55:29.998]  I pay homage to Solante every now and then I'll refer to him as Mustang Ranch.
[02:55:30.098 --> 02:55:32.539]  The prostitute media, the chicken ranch.
[02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:35.381]  Yeah, I heard him call him that.
[02:55:36.021 --> 02:55:43.565]  I want to ask you guys, if you know Rush Limbaugh well enough to tell me
[02:55:44.867 --> 02:56:01.416]  Why he will, you know, because he, he, I was, Max was, um, talking about different ways of, um, getting people to, to really move this thing in the other direction and, and real vocal people like yourself and, and others, um, have made so much progress.
[02:56:01.997 --> 02:56:09.601]  Here we have, uh, Rush Limbaugh who will go so far and he could just, he could tip this thing over on the, um, you know, the tipping point.
[02:56:09.661 --> 02:56:13.803]  It could be, he could move this thing the other way with, um, Ron Paul and so forth.
[02:56:14.384 --> 02:56:14.544]  What,
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:16.820]  What is he doing?
[02:56:17.260 --> 02:56:18.721]  How can he go so far?
[02:56:18.941 --> 02:56:25.322]  Well, I mean, they're in there to be steam valves and control people, and that's why the system has put him forward.
[02:56:25.902 --> 02:56:34.124]  There's a lot of people with more talent than Rush Limbaugh, but he's put up there as the Big King Daddy because he'll play along with the establishment system.
[02:56:34.584 --> 02:56:40.505]  I mean, that's a very, very, you know, easy answer, and the sewer stream media
[02:56:41.502 --> 02:56:42.366]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:42.567 --> 02:56:43.331]  That's a good question.
[02:56:43.652 --> 02:56:45.983]  Max, where do you see the sewer stream media going?
[02:56:47.386 --> 02:56:58.168]  Well, I mean, this is an interesting question because Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly and Michael Savage, these guys are what I call the shock right.
[02:56:58.308 --> 02:56:59.669]  The right wing on the shock.
[02:56:59.729 --> 02:57:03.229]  I know, I don't want to get into a whole discussion about right versus left.
[02:57:03.269 --> 02:57:06.890]  I just want to, for the purposes of making this point, let me digress.
[02:57:07.390 --> 02:57:10.351]  Okay, he is on the shock right.
[02:57:10.551 --> 02:57:15.172]  There is nobody in America who's on the shock left.
[02:57:15.632 --> 02:57:20.294]  There is, on MSNBC, you've got Rachel Maddow.
[02:57:21.174 --> 02:57:21.974]  She's a centrist.
[02:57:22.234 --> 02:57:24.555]  You've got Amy Goodman of Democracy Now!
[02:57:24.695 --> 02:57:25.896]  She's in the center.
[02:57:26.396 --> 02:57:28.137]  Tom Hartman, who's on RT.
[02:57:28.197 --> 02:57:32.718]  He's also the biggest so-called progressive radio host in America.
[02:57:33.138 --> 02:57:35.519]  I don't even think he's on the left either.
[02:57:35.559 --> 02:57:36.340]  He's a centrist.
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:37.800]  There is no left.
[02:57:37.820 --> 02:57:38.801]  There is no shock left.
[02:57:38.881 --> 02:57:45.503]  Imagine if Max Keiser had a three-hour, every morning, talk show on a major
[02:57:45.523 --> 02:57:46.784]  But Max, I wouldn't call you left.
[02:57:46.804 --> 02:57:48.486]  I don't even go off those terms.
[02:58:04.542 --> 02:58:06.804]  They've tried to put up the young turd guy.
[02:58:06.824 --> 02:58:22.817]  I don't want to digress into this whole right-left business, but in the case of the radio landscape in America, and you've got your show, which is completely independent, and you've cobbled together this massive audience by dint of sheer
[02:58:23.558 --> 02:58:25.239]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:25.279 --> 02:58:26.479]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:48.849 --> 02:58:49.870]  I had tried everything.
[02:58:49.930 --> 02:58:54.993]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:58:55.413 --> 02:58:59.896]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:59:00.236 --> 02:59:06.620]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:59:07.100 --> 02:59:17.585]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:59:18.326 --> 02:59:22.448]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:59:22.788 --> 02:59:28.831]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:59:29.051 --> 02:59:30.192]  Now that's results.
[02:59:30.612 --> 02:59:42.637]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[02:59:43.117 --> 02:59:45.358]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[02:59:45.678 --> 02:59:47.419]  Infowarsteam.com.
[02:59:49.280 --> 02:59:50.440]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:50.821 --> 02:59:52.221]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:52.881 --> 02:59:56.083]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:06.823]  When your country is being turned into a 21st century banana republic police state.
[03:00:07.643 --> 03:00:10.364]  Silence isn't golden, it's yellow.
[03:00:11.084 --> 03:00:15.886]  You are listening to Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:16.446 --> 03:00:20.128]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:22.069 --> 03:00:26.771]  You know Max, we should have you back up next week if you could do it to just have a media discussion.
[03:00:28.103 --> 03:00:30.544]  But I was just looking at the Rothschilds on Wikipedia.
[03:00:30.964 --> 03:00:34.685]  Hundreds of palaces, castles, more than the royal family of England.
[03:00:35.966 --> 03:00:38.967]  Just owning giant combines all over the world.
[03:00:39.507 --> 03:00:41.708]  Major stock in every major central bank.
[03:00:42.548 --> 03:00:45.289]  Unknown trillions in overall aggregate wealth.
[03:00:45.669 --> 03:00:49.331]  And they'll sue a newspaper for saying he's a puppet master.
[03:00:50.291 --> 03:00:52.072]  Uh, and manipulating Russian oligarchs.
[03:00:52.593 --> 03:00:57.696]  I mean, it just shows how they try to use the courts now against people, but thank God the courts ruled against them.
[03:00:57.716 --> 03:01:00.999]  Uh, it's just, it's super creepy, Max.
[03:01:01.923 --> 03:01:09.947]  Well, first of all, you know, I want to ask, is there something I should read into the fact that you're having me on your show on Valentine's Day?
[03:01:09.967 --> 03:01:14.909]  I mean, I know you like me and I like you, but I don't know if I like you like that.
[03:01:15.329 --> 03:01:21.672]  Okay, Max, I just want to say, I told him about a week ago, I said, I want to get Max Keiser on and they set you up today.
[03:01:22.012 --> 03:01:23.973]  And so, yeah, that's what's going on.
[03:01:25.054 --> 03:01:28.575]  Was that intentional that somebody set him up on Valentine's Day?
[03:01:28.595 --> 03:01:30.076]  Oh, it's so sweet.
[03:01:30.136 --> 03:01:31.497]  I didn't know he thought of me like that.
[03:01:32.325 --> 03:01:37.587]  Well, Max, I have to be honest, I didn't ever even think of such a thing until now.
[03:01:37.607 --> 03:01:40.267]  But thanks to you, you've entered that into my mind.
[03:01:40.287 --> 03:01:47.950]  And here I am, just, you know, enjoying a nice glass of tangy tangerine, having a fantastic time.
[03:01:48.470 --> 03:01:59.233]  Now anyway, so the Rothschilds are, in fact, they have, you know, that scene in, you know, a good movie reference is in the movie The Sting.
[03:01:59.753 --> 03:02:04.319]  Where the criminal is on the golf course, and he says, I want you to go break that guy's legs.
[03:02:04.699 --> 03:02:07.082]  And he says, gee, boss, he's just a low-level grifter.
[03:02:07.563 --> 03:02:12.589]  And he goes, well, you know, if we let a low-level grifter get away, you know, someday they'll be coming after us.
[03:02:12.649 --> 03:02:15.132]  We gotta be, you know, take care of this.
[03:02:15.532 --> 03:02:16.492]  And this is the way they think.
[03:02:16.572 --> 03:02:25.356]  If there's any challenge at all, in any sense, they will go after you with the full force of everything they have to put you down.
[03:02:25.716 --> 03:02:38.522]  Because they don't want a single scintilla of dissent to any way to challenge their monopoly, pricing, rent-seeking, empire-building kleptocracy.
[03:02:40.714 --> 03:02:46.796]  Well, you're right, and they want a global government with carbon taxes to shut everybody down while ignoring all the real problems in the environment.
[03:02:47.256 --> 03:02:53.618]  Why are the elites allowing all this GMO stuff that's destroying the Earth's original biosphere and endangering everything?
[03:02:53.658 --> 03:02:57.859]  And why do the elites allow the military to detonate hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere?
[03:02:57.879 --> 03:03:01.600]  I mean, it's like they're trying to destroy the planet or something.
[03:03:02.486 --> 03:03:18.395]  Well Monsanto, of course the big seller of genetically modified seeds, the business model is quite remarkable because they figured out that you could trade seeds like a currency, in this case the Monsanto Terminator seeds, that don't reproduce.
[03:03:18.796 --> 03:03:22.338]  So you have to buy those seeds continuously every single year.
[03:03:23.018 --> 03:03:25.039]  And you have to borrow money to buy those seeds.
[03:03:25.079 --> 03:03:40.903]  This is why the exact number I don't have in my fingertips, but something like 2,000 Indian farmers a month commit suicide because Monsanto has priced agriculture so far out of reach of the average Indian farmer that they simply kill themselves.
[03:03:41.023 --> 03:03:47.365]  They approach agriculture the way Jamie Dimon and JP Morgan approach the credit markets or approach
[03:03:47.845 --> 03:03:48.706]  The finance market.
[03:03:48.906 --> 03:03:50.187]  They fill it with derivatives.
[03:03:50.527 --> 03:03:56.432]  They completely overextend it with massive financialization of something called agriculture.
[03:03:57.092 --> 03:04:06.159]  And then they subject the people who are supposed to be using this product, farmers, to onerous debt loads to the point where they're indentured servants or they kill themselves.
[03:04:06.599 --> 03:04:08.080]  And quite frankly, they don't care.
[03:04:08.381 --> 03:04:19.710]  Monsanto, of course, has a track record of this type of behavior, going back to Agent Orange and the Vietnam War, and all kinds of other transgressions that the company's been guilty of, that makes them an extraordinary amount of money.
[03:04:20.110 --> 03:04:30.579]  The board of directors is full of the same guys on the board of directors for Halliburton or Exxon or any of these other major corporations who are part of the Pentagon or part of the Wall Street banking establishment.
[03:04:30.859 --> 03:04:32.960]  And they all swap notes, and they go to Davos.
[03:04:33.340 --> 03:04:41.362]  And of course, remember last year at Davos, they floated the idea of recapitalizing the global economy with $100 trillion worth of fresh debt.
[03:04:41.502 --> 03:04:43.923]  Which will all go to them, and then they'll pose as our saviors.
[03:04:43.963 --> 03:04:45.163]  Sorry to some of the other callers.
[03:04:45.583 --> 03:04:46.423]  Didn't get to you.
[03:04:46.883 --> 03:04:47.844]  Max, great job.
[03:04:47.884 --> 03:04:52.285]  Thank you for joining us and chronicling our spiraling descent into the New World Order.
[03:04:52.605 --> 03:04:54.945]  The answer is, say no to the New World Order.
[03:04:55.146 --> 03:04:56.466]  See you back tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:04:58.641 --> 03:05:05.575]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[03:05:05.815 --> 03:05:10.665]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
