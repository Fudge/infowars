[00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:02.801]  We're good.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.644]  Good evening and welcome to InfoWars Nightly News on this April 20, 2012 edition.
[00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:42.566]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:50.232]  Tonight, on the InfoWars Nightly News, our story on mandatory black boxes in cars is making waves in the mainstream media.
[00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:59.038]  Paul Joseph Watson covers this, and he shows you the law where by 2015, every car in America will have a black box that will track and trace you.
[00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.681]  Plus, 29 ways the government is now wasting your money.
[00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:04.042]  Included in that list?
[00:01:04.342 --> 00:01:05.003]  Studying white
[00:01:05.103 --> 00:01:07.345]  Chimps throw poop.
[00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:15.450]  Also, new insights of CIA involvement in the JFK assassination, like we didn't know that already.
[00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.055]  And Rob Dew sits down with Stuart Rhodes, head of Oath Keepers, to discuss the NDAA and other ways our freedoms are being taken.
[00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:26.238]  All this and more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:30.040]  We take you now to London, England and Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:39.713 --> 00:01:41.674]  Okay, folks, let's get straight to the news.
[00:01:41.954 --> 00:01:48.258]  First headline tonight, Bill allowing IRS to revoke passports described as, quote, Stalinist.
[00:01:48.598 --> 00:02:08.050]  The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, Mark 21, is so crammed full of unconstitutional provisions that even the mainstream media is up in arms, with an Investors Business Daily editorial describing the section that allows the IRS to revoke passports of accused tax delinquents as, quote, Stalinist.
[00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:22.919]  And this, of course, is the legislation, or at least one part of it, we'll go on to discuss others later, which empowers the IRS to suspend travel rights of American citizens simply accused of owing $50,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.522]  And you've heard our take on it over the past week or so.
[00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:35.405]  This is what Investors Business Daily, a prominent mainstream newspaper, had to say.
[00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:37.846]  That's not me saying that.
[00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:39.647]  That's not Alex Jones saying that.
[00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:43.748]  That's a typically mainstream, middle-of-the-road newspaper saying that.
[00:02:55.066 --> 00:03:07.697]  And they go on basically to describe this IRS provision as the biggest threat to mobility rights since the domination of Eastern Europe by the Communist Party and the Berlin Wall.
[00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:20.808]  And it's basically, they say, a recreation of Stalin's internal passport system whereby Soviet comrades weren't allowed to leave their area of residence without permission from the government.
[00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.293]  And this is what's being drafted into law under this new bill if it gets past the House.
[00:03:27.334 --> 00:03:27.774]  Quote!
[00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:47.686]  There remain few things more prized than American citizenship, yet now our ever-expanding leviathan of a government is forcing Americans abroad out, and it might soon build its own Berlin Wall, restricting our freedom of world travel, as Reagan put it, even when there is no conviction from a court, states the editorial.
[00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:49.588]  And they make the connection, of course, that
[00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:55.390]  The recent news that Americans in record numbers are renouncing their citizenship for this exact reason.
[00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.131]  The Fed's praying into their financial affairs.
[00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:02.673]  And this ties into our next story, which is about the same bill.
[00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:09.016]  Forbes writer scoffs at InfoWars' freak-out on mandatory black boxers.
[00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:22.935]  And so, as you've read, we've reported this week on the mandatory event data recorders that are also in this MAP 21 legislation that includes the IRS empowerment to revoke passports.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:34.264]  And in subsequent articles on the matter, we explored the fact that we know these black boxes are already in most new vehicles, aside from a few manufacturers.
[00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:37.946]  I mean, Alex Jones has been talking about this since the 1990s.
[00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:46.490]  The point is, they're trying to make them mandatory now, because this is how they're going to implement the carbon tax by the mile system.
[00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.092]  Which, you know, the Obama administration has been pushing for for years.
[00:04:51.672 --> 00:04:57.595]  This is how they will generate the automatic speeding fines and charge it directly to your bank account.
[00:04:58.015 --> 00:05:00.436]  You know, fines for not wearing your seatbelt.
[00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:05.358]  Insurance premiums going up based on these fines.
[00:05:05.418 --> 00:05:08.540]  This is all going to be recorded by this black box.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.640]  That's the point of it.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.281]  Total invasion of privacy.
[00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:23.571]  But this trendy at Forbes magazine called Cashmere Hill, this so-called privacy expert, who if you read a blog actually couldn't care less for privacy, she comes out with this snivelling piece.
[00:05:23.952 --> 00:05:27.595]  Hate to break it to you, but your car likely has a black box spying on you already.
[00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:40.089]  Which, we already knew the fact, but she basically accuses us of, you know, freaking out and then says, unbelievably, that Map 21 is, quote, good for privacy!
[00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:43.571]  That's right, good for privacy, according to this Forbes writer.
[00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:51.618]  I mean, it empowers the IRS to share your intimate financial information with the TSA and US immigration authorities.
[00:05:52.219 --> 00:06:01.447]  It implements this mandatory black box to track where you go, how far you drive, imposes fines and penalties if you deactivate it.
[00:06:02.168 --> 00:06:11.437]  And it also lays the groundwork, as I also covered, for this vehicle-to-infrastructure communication system, which is basically a bug implanted in your car.
[00:06:12.117 --> 00:06:20.024]  It works, or will work, with these IntelliStreets light poles that have got computer systems that broadcast two-way information.
[00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:25.168]  They've also been slated to be used to listen to conversations.
[00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:32.573]  So all this is going to be hooked into this black box tracker, as well as the vehicle to infrastructure communication systems.
[00:06:32.593 --> 00:06:36.615]  But according to this trendy at Forbes, it's good for privacy.
[00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:39.798]  The bill is good for privacy, even though it destroys privacy.
[00:06:40.808 --> 00:06:58.803]  So I guess that's why CIA Chief David Petraeus recently bragged that the government wouldn't have to bother implanting a bug in your house or your car because the people were doing it to themselves through this Internet of Things of which your car will become a part once this bill gets through.
[00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:06.914]  So again, Forbes writer Kashmir Hill says it's good for privacy when it destroys your privacy.
[00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:10.577]  I mean, it's obvious she hasn't even read the bill.
[00:07:10.617 --> 00:07:15.560]  She doesn't even mention IRS revoking passports or the two-way bug implants.
[00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:26.668]  But to their credit, some other journalists and columnists in the mainstream media are giving this subject its proper dues, which we'll now explore.
[00:07:27.702 --> 00:07:32.224]  Meet the bill that wants to put plane-like black boxes in our cars.
[00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:34.986]  This is Megan Garger out of the Atlantic.
[00:07:35.926 --> 00:07:43.470]  InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson reading through section 31406 of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act.
[00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.272]  Map 21 bill that's currently making its way through Congress made a nice catch.
[00:07:48.332 --> 00:07:53.955]  The bill calls for, quote, mandatory event data recorders to be installed in all new vehicles starting in the year 2015.
[00:07:55.456 --> 00:08:02.681]  So, you know, it's nice to be given credit by some journalists, and they're actually recognizing the threat that this bill poses to privacy.
[00:08:04.343 --> 00:08:23.197]  After our article on Wednesday, it was also mentioned in the Business Insider, and now it seems that this black box tracking system is starting to get more and more attention, so hopefully the resistance to this bill will begin to build to a crescendo, because at the moment it's going to sail through the House
[00:08:23.757 --> 00:08:33.187]  With barely a whimper of protest, so the fact that it's getting more and more attention is a good thing for the purposes of trying to stop it from getting passed.
[00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:34.526]  Moving on.
[00:08:34.606 --> 00:08:36.408]  Spy drones over America.
[00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:40.832]  Lawmakers demand answers on privacy safeguards by Steve Watson.
[00:08:41.413 --> 00:08:53.505]  A bipartisan pair of congressmen joined forces Thursday to put important questions to the Federal Aviation Administration regarding the agency's plans to open up American skies to thousands of surveillance drones.
[00:08:54.306 --> 00:09:05.834]  They've also actually now, after a threat of lawsuit, published this map which shows you which states have given permission for these surveillance drones to be used in.
[00:09:05.854 --> 00:09:18.502]  Hawaii has barred it and there are also a handful of other US states that have prevented permission, refused to grant permission for these surveillance drones to be flown in those particular states.
[00:09:19.043 --> 00:09:23.506]  So basically these congressmen have written a letter to the FAA asking
[00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:27.629]  How this relates to privacy, how it's going to violate people's privacy.
[00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:43.340]  But, you know, I guess if we listen to the trendies over at Forbes, the same people who say Bill Gates is a hero and drones used to hunt insurgents in Afghanistan are, you know, good for privacy, I guess, then I suppose that
[00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:47.467]  The mass use of drones in law enforcement is good for privacy.
[00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:50.512]  I mean, that's the new trendy double think.
[00:09:51.053 --> 00:09:54.158]  Everything that destroys privacy is in fact good for privacy.
[00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:56.542]  That's what the trendies say over at Forbes.
[00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:03.147]  Moving on, Climate Alarmist calls for burning down skeptics' homes.
[00:10:03.948 --> 00:10:08.113]  And this is actually featured over the Drudge Report today as one of their top headlines.
[00:10:08.153 --> 00:10:11.877]  And once again, eco-fascism raises its ugly head.
[00:10:12.338 --> 00:10:14.720]  And this is Steve Zwick writing for...
[00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:28.413]  You guessed it, Forbes Magazine once again, destroying privacy is good for privacy, and basically says if you dare to challenge the brainwashing on climate change, then your house should be allowed to burn to the ground.
[00:10:29.034 --> 00:10:35.440]  Quote, we know who the active denialists are, not the people who buy the lies, mind you, but the people who create the lies.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:41.685]  Let's start keeping track of them now, and when the famines come, let's make them pay.
[00:10:42.426 --> 00:10:44.888]  Let's let their houses burn!
[00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:47.791]  Let's swap their safe land for submerged islands.
[00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:55.998]  Let's force them to bear the cost of rising food prices, writes Zwick, adding they broke the climate, why should the rest of us have to pay for it?
[00:10:56.578 --> 00:11:00.702]  So again, the alarmists have lost the debate.
[00:11:01.162 --> 00:11:05.066]  The polls show belief in man-made global warming is plummeting.
[00:11:06.095 --> 00:11:17.640]  And the alarmists have resorted to using threats and intellectual coercion because the pseudoscience behind their fictional control freak agenda is collapsing.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.201]  You know, we had the article last week.
[00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:28.485]  Arctic sea ice expanding, polar bears thriving, emperor penguins thriving, Himalayan glaciers expanding.
[00:11:29.892 --> 00:11:32.893]  You know, coldest April in Britain for a hundred years.
[00:11:34.634 --> 00:11:39.517]  But our houses need to burn for simply pointing that information out, apparently, according to Zwick.
[00:11:40.397 --> 00:11:41.958]  So I just say keep them coming.
[00:11:41.998 --> 00:11:50.522]  I mean, they're only discrediting themselves in the public arena with each successive temper tantrum that these climate alarmists have.
[00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:53.899]  And you know, this is by no means the worst of it.
[00:11:54.559 --> 00:12:04.647]  People have called for putting sceptics up on Nuremberg war crimes trials, treating them for mental disorders, labelling them as racists.
[00:12:04.687 --> 00:12:14.936]  We had the 1010 Global organisation with its satire ad showing kids who refused to lower their carbon footprints being blown up in an explosion of blood and guts.
[00:12:16.363 --> 00:12:26.048]  I mean, there was an article today out of the Telegraph where this green Nazi control freak actually tried to say that climate change was a feminist issue.
[00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:31.111]  So again, anything, everything to shift it away from the fact that
[00:12:32.432 --> 00:12:35.174]  You know, the case is collapsing.
[00:12:35.214 --> 00:12:37.816]  That's why they refuse to debate the sceptics anymore.
[00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:42.580]  They just call for them to be strung up, put on trial, killed, houses burned down.
[00:12:44.101 --> 00:12:47.384]  And the fact is, these people don't care about real environmental problems.
[00:12:47.404 --> 00:12:51.987]  They're not concerned about the horrors that Monsanto are inflicting upon the planet.
[00:12:52.768 --> 00:12:57.352]  The eugenicists, they're the ones that are set to make all the power and money off the global carbon tax.
[00:12:58.092 --> 00:13:01.173]  And they're pushing a dogma that's anti-human.
[00:13:01.653 --> 00:13:06.654]  It seeks to demolish the very underpinnings of what makes a free and prosperous society.
[00:13:07.055 --> 00:13:26.080]  And they want to replace it with their scientific dictatorship, planned-opolis nightmare, which is why they're coming out with all these threats and intimidation that we need to shut up, otherwise we're going to be targeted as personally responsible when their whole scientific technocracy comes into being.
[00:13:27.987 --> 00:13:30.212]  Next, story on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:35.242]  Chimps throwing poop and 29 other mind-blowing ways the government is wasting your money.
[00:13:36.909 --> 00:13:46.937]  And a lot of this, funnily enough, is actually the same kind of scientists that milk the gravy train of global warming that gives them all these millions of dollars in federal government grant money.
[00:13:47.477 --> 00:14:05.351]  So this article at Economic Collapse Blog basically just lists some of the mind-blowingly pointless things that the federal government is funding to the tune of hundreds of thousands, and in some cases billions of dollars, while the people are told, you know, they must labor under poverty and austerity.
[00:14:06.604 --> 00:14:07.725]  And here's just a few of them.
[00:14:07.765 --> 00:14:10.507]  You can read the full list at the original article.
[00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:21.836]  In 2011, National Institutes of Health spent $592,000 on a study that sought to figure out, once and for all, why chimpanzees throw poop.
[00:14:22.717 --> 00:14:25.519]  Because obviously that's very important to understand.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:37.489]  You know, food stamp usage is at record levels, the debt's out of all control, but they're spending nearly $600,000 on figuring out why chimps throw poo at each other.
[00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.351]  Okay, that's great.
[00:14:39.991 --> 00:14:40.632]  Here's another one.
[00:14:41.877 --> 00:14:50.801]  National Institutes of Health, again, spent more than $5 million on a website called Sex Pulse that's targeted at men who use internet to seek sex with men.
[00:14:51.201 --> 00:14:53.962]  Again, your tax dollars at work.
[00:14:55.383 --> 00:15:01.666]  Federal government is spending millions of dollars to train Asian call centre workers, outsourcing your jobs in the process.
[00:15:02.306 --> 00:15:10.350]  The federal government spent $175,000 to determine if cocaine makes Japanese quail engage in sexually risky behaviour.
[00:15:11.303 --> 00:15:18.005]  That's obviously, you know, I guess it's a national security issue or something.
[00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:27.388]  $600,000 spent or given to researchers at Columbia University by the federal government to study how heterosexuals use the internet to find love.
[00:15:28.008 --> 00:15:28.288]  Again.
[00:15:29.588 --> 00:15:32.169]  That's worth $600,000 of your money any day.
[00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:41.334]  They also gave $3,000,000 to researchers at the University of California at Irvine to fund their research into video games such as World of Warcraft.
[00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.215]  Another worthy cause.
[00:15:44.196 --> 00:15:45.657]  National Institutes of Health.
[00:15:47.372 --> 00:15:55.155]  $400,000 to study why gay men in Argentina engage in risky sexual behavior when they're drunk.
[00:15:55.835 --> 00:16:05.938]  Maybe we should, you know, spend another half a million on seeing if that's connected to the Japanese quails who also engage in sexually risky behavior, God knows.
[00:16:06.786 --> 00:16:08.748]  But that's just a few of them.
[00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:24.643]  There's literally, there's about 30 different ones and you can go to the original article and read about it, but it's just an illustration of out-of-control government spending and all kinds of ridiculous crap while we're being told that we've got to pay for the bailouts and everything else.
[00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:26.384]  Moving on.
[00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:32.841]  Mary Pinchot Meyer, JFK mistress, assassinated by CIA, new book says.
[00:16:33.481 --> 00:16:34.842]  This is out of the Huffington Post.
[00:16:35.442 --> 00:16:43.046]  Conspiracy theorists who question President John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 have, over the years, become obsessed with another murder.
[00:16:43.066 --> 00:16:56.513]  On October 12, 1964, socialite and artist Mary Pinchot Meyer, a long-time Kennedy mistress, was shot execution-style in broad daylight while walking along the Georgetown Canal towpath.
[00:16:57.438 --> 00:17:00.701]  Within hours, police charged day laborer Ray Crump Jr.
[00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:01.481]  with murder.
[00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:10.249]  They never found the gun, however, and a jury acquitted Crump after an eyewitness described the killer as much bigger than the diminutive defendant.
[00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:15.954]  In the ensuing years, the case has become one of Washington's most infamous unresolved murder cases.
[00:17:16.895 --> 00:17:18.776]  And there's a new book coming out about this.
[00:17:19.197 --> 00:17:22.740]  Obviously, no time to delve into such a gargantuan subject now, but
[00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:36.224]  Jim Mars in his book actually lists over a hundred people who died in mysterious circumstances, mainly accidents or suicides, who were eyewitnesses to the JFK assassination.
[00:17:37.944 --> 00:17:46.628]  Earlier this month we had the Secret Service agent come out and said that Jackie Kennedy's last words were, quote, Oh Jack, what have they done?
[00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:50.912]  Obviously the word they being suggestive of a wider plot.
[00:17:52.033 --> 00:18:01.876]  You know, in the past we've had Madeleine Duncan Brown, LBJ's mistress, who gave an interview saying basically LBJ conspired the night before to have JFK killed.
[00:18:02.696 --> 00:18:07.918]  The quote, according to her, those SOBs will never embarrass me again.
[00:18:08.318 --> 00:18:12.560]  That's what LBJ said about the Kennedys the night before the assassination.
[00:18:14.188 --> 00:18:20.794]  Again, just a baseless conspiracy theory, as much of the JFK material is still treated by the establishment.
[00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:28.122]  Barr McClellan, the father of the former White House Press Secretary, he came out and said that it was an LBJ plot.
[00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:36.230]  Of course, E. Howard Hunt, who came on, we had his son come on with the revelations on the Alex Jones Show a few years ago about
[00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:44.770]  How he was a benchwarmer in the plot to kill JFK and he also implicated LBJ in the plot.
[00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:57.137]  Then of course we got the famous wink from Congressman Albert Thomas that he gave to LBJ as Johnson was being sworn in as, you know, JFK's replacement when he became president after his death.
[00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:00.169]  So, the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:19:00.729 --> 00:19:22.880]  It would take a 2,000-word book to lay it out, but obviously the polls show the vast majority of Americans disbelieve the official conspiracy theory about JFK, but the establishment still uses this grassy-knoll cliché to debunk anyone who attempts to challenge the establishment orthodoxy on any modern event.
[00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:27.683]  So, new book coming out with new revelations about JFK, so we'll await that one.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.301]  Final story tonight on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:19:31.701 --> 00:19:39.702]  Roundup herbicide linked to Parkinson's related brain damage from greenmedinfo.com.
[00:19:40.062 --> 00:19:58.066]  Alarming new research published in the journal Neurotoxicology and Keratology supports the emerging connection between glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup herbicide, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonian disorders.
[00:19:58.926 --> 00:20:08.951]  And basically, this article lists different modes of toxicity that this Monsanto-produced herbicide, Roundup, has been linked with.
[00:20:10.311 --> 00:20:16.134]  And of course, this is the product that was previously labelled by Monsanto, safe as table salt!
[00:20:17.014 --> 00:20:20.016]  So you can sprinkle it on your chips and eat it, it's that safe!
[00:20:20.967 --> 00:20:31.991]  But of course, the studies have shown that it's the primary cause of colony collapse disorder, this mass die-off of bees, as well as the die-offs of other insects, including butterflies.
[00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:41.774]  So, you know, we know that Monsanto recently bought out one of the companies responsible for researching colony collapse disorder.
[00:20:42.054 --> 00:20:46.056]  That's right, they actually bought the group that was studying why the bees were dying,
[00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:54.866]  I mean, why doesn't Monsanto just buy up all the organisations that are looking into the causes of Parkinson's disease?
[00:20:55.306 --> 00:20:59.528]  It's like some kind of bizarre Borg assimilation process.
[00:21:00.088 --> 00:21:03.030]  You know, you have an organisation that links Monsanto with
[00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:11.416]  Mass die-offs of bees, neurological disorders, and Monsanto just says, right, we're just going to buy up the company and bury the data.
[00:21:11.957 --> 00:21:15.760]  You will be assimilated into the Monsanto board.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.404]  Unfortunately for them, though, they can't assimilate the thousands of activists
[00:21:22.105 --> 00:21:32.191]  Committed campaigners who have successfully evicted Monsanto out of several European and South American countries.
[00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:39.195]  So while Monsanto will continue to try and buy up anyone who points out that they're responsible for killing off
[00:21:39.795 --> 00:21:52.665]  Bees, butterflies, and innumerable other insects, as well as links to neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, the war against their deadly GMO poison continues.
[00:21:53.205 --> 00:22:07.696]  And if you're looking to find out more information on Monsanto's war on the environment and family farms, I encourage you to check out the documentary, Farmageddon, The Unseen War on American Family Farms, which is available at the Info Wars store today.
[00:22:07.776 --> 00:22:08.337]  Check it out.

[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:54.705]  Coming up after the break, Rob Dew sits down for an interview with Stuart Rhodes to talk about the widening resistance against the National Defense Authorization Act with anti-NDAA resolutions in Virginia and Arizona.
[00:22:54.745 --> 00:22:56.245]  So stay tuned for that interview.
[00:23:02.557 --> 00:23:11.580]  In what will become the largest domestic spying operation in history, the National Security Agency, or NSA, is building a top-secret facility just south of Salt Lake City, Utah.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:25.224]  The Utah Data Center, which is currently under construction at the southern end of Camp Williams, a Utah National Guard base, is slated to be a one million square foot repository of all digital communications in the United States and abroad.
[00:23:26.144 --> 00:23:37.890]  As this report will show you, there is a growing connection between the NSA and the LDS Church, also known as the Mormons, connected to the church's long-standing practice of sending missionaries out to foreign countries.
[00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:52.857]  Missionaries, who typically serve two-year terms as messengers of their religion, often travel to foreign countries, earn top-secret clearances, and learn language skills at the Missionary Training Center near Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.
[00:23:53.658 --> 00:23:57.525]  A deeper, darker course is also being taught, however, at BYU.
[00:23:58.146 --> 00:24:03.555]  One which may involve those who return from their missionary travels spying on American citizens.
[00:24:04.468 --> 00:24:07.790]  Well, we look at the mathematics behind cryptography.
[00:24:08.431 --> 00:24:14.655]  We look at classical encryptions, something as easy as a substitution cipher or a cryptogram puzzle.
[00:24:15.456 --> 00:24:27.705]  But then we also look at more modern methods of encryption and methods of sharing data that use more sophisticated mathematics.
[00:24:28.385 --> 00:24:31.768]  Now, the mathematics behind this is, you know,
[00:24:33.042 --> 00:24:39.486]  It's at a level that undergraduate students can't understand it with just a little bit of math background.
[00:24:39.546 --> 00:24:42.927]  In fact, we've taught this to incoming freshmen here at BYU.
[00:24:42.947 --> 00:24:43.628]  Here we are.
[00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:44.508]  What's your name, sir?
[00:24:44.548 --> 00:24:45.248]  My name is Chris.
[00:24:45.769 --> 00:24:45.909]  Chris.
[00:24:45.929 --> 00:24:47.169]  And where are you from, Chris?
[00:24:47.189 --> 00:24:48.090]  Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.311]  Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:24:49.411 --> 00:24:51.432]  And are you having a good time here in Nashville, Tennessee?
[00:24:51.452 --> 00:24:51.812]  Yes, I am.
[00:24:51.952 --> 00:24:52.332]  Awesome.
[00:24:52.812 --> 00:24:55.094]  And do you know who Barry Satoro is?
[00:24:55.154 --> 00:24:56.014]  No, I do not.
[00:24:56.074 --> 00:24:57.575]  You don't know who Barry Satoro is.
[00:24:58.275 --> 00:25:05.702]  What would you say if I told you that Barry Satoro is the real name of Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States of America?
[00:25:06.503 --> 00:25:09.465]  Uh, I guess I'd learn something new today.
[00:25:09.485 --> 00:25:16.472]  Downtown Nashville to talk to the Johnson Creek Stranglers man to find out if they know who Barry Satoro is.
[00:25:17.959 --> 00:25:19.119]  Excuse me, sir, can I have your name?
[00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:20.620]  My name is Joe Sanders.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.100]  Joe Sanders, and you are?
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:22.760]  Johnny Outlaw.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.700]  Johnny Outlaw, and you are?
[00:25:25.181 --> 00:25:25.921]  Mofford Pickens.
[00:25:26.141 --> 00:25:30.082]  Mofford Pickens, and do you all know who Barry Satoro is?
[00:25:30.442 --> 00:25:32.582]  I don't know who Barry Satoro is.
[00:25:32.602 --> 00:25:38.863]  This is Flashpoint Radio, and I am your host, Jay Z. It is Monday, April the 16th, 2012.
[00:25:42.612 --> 00:26:11.673]  uh... and yes i am going to court along with my eight-plus month pregnant wife to uh... maplewood where we used to live where i went to court last time because no animal license phil gold building inspector phil gold cited me then i suppose phil gold being a simple business building inspector could not actually write a citation uh... got officer JG Williams
[00:26:13.086 --> 00:26:15.408]  To write an actual uniform citation.
[00:26:16.488 --> 00:26:16.829]  J.G.
[00:26:16.889 --> 00:26:30.018]  Williams states under... This ticket says, as all tickets, I, knowing that false statements on this form are punishable by law, state that I have probable cause to believe that we have cats on the premises.
[00:26:30.318 --> 00:26:32.420]  This gentleman has never been in my apartment.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.402]  This gentleman has never seen any cats.
[00:26:35.822 --> 00:26:38.184]  He is claiming he did on March 14th.
[00:26:38.525 --> 00:26:40.066]  We will see at court tonight.
[00:26:40.186 --> 00:26:49.155]  Thank you so much, Maplewood, for your simple tyranny that I will defeat so easily with the truth and my pocket constitution.
[00:26:50.056 --> 00:26:54.040]  Well... Aw, look at the sweet little old man.
[00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:57.383]  Why, he could be just about anyone's grandfather.
[00:26:58.604 --> 00:26:59.305]  But who is he?
[00:27:00.908 --> 00:27:08.337]  Is he multi-billionaire businessman philanthropist the Oracle of Omaha?
[00:27:09.939 --> 00:27:16.947]  Or, as he has also been referred to, the scumbag Warren Buffet ice cream demon?
[00:27:18.749 --> 00:27:19.370]  You decide.
[00:27:21.187 --> 00:27:24.528]  Hi there, and welcome back to the Real Story News Underground Studios.
[00:27:25.188 --> 00:27:31.550]  It is Tuesday, April 17, 2012, and I'm Douglas Piper reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.271]  Now this evening I'm going to talk about Warren Buffett.
[00:27:37.912 --> 00:27:46.634]  First off, I'll talk briefly about the Buffett Rule, the proposed new tax law that Obama is pushing for.
[00:27:48.963 --> 00:27:57.690]  Then I'm going to move on to a whole separate side of Warren Buffett, the cute little old grandfatherly man.
[00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:03.074]  A more disturbing side, so stick around for that.
[00:28:04.555 --> 00:28:16.684]  Coming up later in the segment, a cryptologist, a government codebreaker who says that he knew about 9-11 before it happened and even tried to warn his bosses.
[00:28:17.557 --> 00:28:19.098]  But first, the news.
[00:28:19.878 --> 00:28:23.599]  Over the years, it has been one thing after the next with our food supply.
[00:28:24.299 --> 00:28:29.541]  GMOs, high fructose corn syrup, MSG, aspartame, and food coloring.
[00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:33.222]  It's leading consumers to wonder, what next?
[00:28:34.843 --> 00:28:37.684]  By now you're familiar with the term, pink slime.
[00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:49.984]  The mixture of eyeballs, tendons, muscles, and probably even some blood to give it that nice pink color.
[00:28:51.064 --> 00:28:53.045]  That stuff that ended up on our plates.
[00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:57.266]  Now when this story broke, I thought it was rather suspicious.
[00:28:57.726 --> 00:29:03.468]  I wanted to know what took them 50 years to break the story and why now?
[00:29:04.168 --> 00:29:05.949]  Well, as we see in news today,
[00:29:06.676 --> 00:29:10.197]  Beef manufacturers are raising the price of their food.
[00:29:10.797 --> 00:29:16.918]  Just another food spike increase that we've seen lately and there's definitely more to come.
[00:29:17.478 --> 00:29:34.922]  Now all of this coming on the coattails of the news that corporations such as Pepsi have actually been using fetal cells of aborted babies and using this for testing and these products in their foods.
[00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:37.102]  This is outrageous!
[00:29:37.302 --> 00:29:40.503]  This is Chris Gordon reporting for InfoWars San Francisco.
[00:29:40.863 --> 00:29:42.664]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:29:43.064 --> 00:29:46.265]  An information war that Hillary admits they're losing.
[00:29:46.365 --> 00:29:50.126]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[00:29:50.226 --> 00:29:54.108]  The game of global domination that used to be played by brute force.
[00:29:54.708 --> 00:30:01.696]  It's now candid and bureaucratic, to the point where there's actually a tangible document outlining its strategy.
[00:30:02.257 --> 00:30:07.843]  It's called by the UN, Agenda 21, because it is the agenda for the 21st century.
[00:30:09.525 --> 00:30:13.167]  And it sets to literally reconstruct all of life as we know it.
[00:30:13.947 --> 00:30:21.270]  Among those bringing light to this subject is Rosa Corey, who's not your typical California gay pro-choice feminist liberal democrat.
[00:30:21.751 --> 00:30:26.473]  Her speeches are winning over Tea Party members and stirring up city planning meetings.
[00:30:27.313 --> 00:30:36.843]  After discovering this plan while working with landowners responding to imminent domain, she's decided to retire early in her career just to speak out with the following such warnings.
[00:30:37.064 --> 00:30:41.288]  Agenda 21 is a plan to inventory and control
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:49.304]  Hi everyone, this is Sonya up in Montreal reporting for InfoWars.com and I'd like to talk to you about GMOs.
[00:30:49.344 --> 00:30:52.386]  Just a few years ago most people had no idea what GMOs even were.
[00:31:09.468 --> 00:31:18.096]  But now, as there are devastating effects on humans and the environment are coming to light, GMOs are getting more and more widespread attention.
[00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:24.041]  Lately, Monsanto has been getting sued by individuals and in class action lawsuits.
[00:31:24.742 --> 00:31:32.709]  States like Vermont are trying to have the right to label GMO food, even though Monsanto is threatening to sue them.
[00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.092]  Countries such as some in Europe have
[00:31:36.547 --> 00:31:41.990]  We've been trying very hard to keep GMOs banned, and recipients of U.S.
[00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.371]  food aid have been burning GMO seeds.
[00:31:46.091 --> 00:31:56.016]  And yet, despite all this damning evidence coming out against GMOs, we're repeatedly being told that they're safe by groups such as the Council for Biotechnology Information.
[00:31:56.256 --> 00:32:01.739]  Harvard development expert says biotech crops are solution for food and environmental challenges.
[00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:10.686]  I guess if the challenge is to destroy the food supply and the environment, then yeah, GMOs are the perfect solution.
[00:32:15.202 --> 00:32:17.304]  Fight a war against Iran with Syria to our back.
[00:32:17.384 --> 00:32:19.546]  Syria is a very strong military.
[00:32:19.827 --> 00:32:22.910]  They are supplied and equipped with the latest in Russian military technology.
[00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:33.680]  I'm talking S-300 surface-to-air missiles and Iskander or Alexander ballistic missiles capable of carrying and deploying chemical weapons whether they have them or not.
[00:32:34.321 --> 00:32:38.304]  Who knows, but they have the capabilities, the important factor.
[00:32:38.664 --> 00:32:40.185]  They can strike anywhere in the region.
[00:32:40.545 --> 00:32:49.211]  So if we were to, and they are open allies of the Iranians and the Russians, so if we were to strike at Iran, we would be leaving a very strong enemy to our back.
[00:32:49.331 --> 00:32:53.934]  Not only to mention that they also support, arm, and help equip and train Hezbollah.
[00:32:54.234 --> 00:33:00.939]  So we would be fighting a three-fronted war, which even as egotistical and arrogant as some of our military and civilian leaders may be,
[00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:10.304]  It is fundamentally impossible to fight a three-fronted war against three relatively strong armies with the small forces that both we and the Israelis have.
[00:33:10.944 --> 00:33:18.249]  So, why is the enterprise now, to go back around, why is the enterprise in the Mediterranean?
[00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:23.191]  I think the American people need to prepare themselves for a Gulf of Tonkin-like scenario.
[00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:28.414]  This is the last deployment of the USS Enterprise, and it is very important that it is being deployed to
[00:33:29.815 --> 00:33:31.796]  I'm announcing our biggest contest ever!
[00:33:57.984 --> 00:34:04.150]  And we're looking for people who love freedom and who want to be all in in the resistance to tyrants.
[00:34:07.894 --> 00:34:10.156]  So you say you want to fight the New World Order.
[00:34:10.917 --> 00:34:17.083]  Why, if you were on the radio, if you were Alex Jones, you'd really kick some globalist ass.
[00:34:18.384 --> 00:34:19.405]  Well, here's your chance.
[00:34:20.242 --> 00:34:31.331]  We're hiring not one, but two new reporters whose reports are going to be on the radio, whose reports are going to be on the nightly news, who will even anchor the show.
[00:34:32.452 --> 00:34:39.418]  If you're ready, here's your chance to step into my shoes, and I hope you surpass what I've done.
[00:34:40.413 --> 00:34:48.978]  Two winners, $10,000 in prizes, and a shot to be a reporter inside the Infowars.com command center.
[00:34:49.558 --> 00:34:53.601]  We're looking to hire one male reporter and one female reporter.
[00:34:54.818 --> 00:35:11.031]  And when you win, you win $5,000, your video gets seen by hundreds of thousands if not millions of people on YouTube, and you get put into the very front of the running to be hired as a reporter slash anchor right here in our operation.
[00:35:13.407 --> 00:35:15.828]  Do you have what it takes to be the next Info Warrior?
[00:35:16.728 --> 00:35:20.869]  The rules are posted below me here and at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:21.209 --> 00:35:22.229]  This is a big deal.
[00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:25.390]  You know, the globalists are expanding their global empire.
[00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.671]  But at the same time, the people are waking up all over the world.
[00:35:29.851 --> 00:35:32.012]  We've expanded our operations in the last year.
[00:35:32.352 --> 00:35:34.232]  We've added the nightly news five nights a week.
[00:35:34.552 --> 00:35:35.973]  We're making more special reports.
[00:35:36.393 --> 00:35:39.393]  We're reaching 15 million people every week.
[00:35:40.114 --> 00:35:41.594]  In a year, I want that to be 30 million.
[00:35:43.154 --> 00:35:44.794]  This is your chance to join the team.
[00:35:45.455 --> 00:35:46.955]  I want to see what you can do.
[00:35:47.715 --> 00:35:49.016]  But a big hint is this.
[00:35:49.756 --> 00:35:52.276]  Can your news piece make the news?
[00:35:53.577 --> 00:35:56.238]  Does it get people's attention?
[00:35:56.558 --> 00:35:57.878]  Does it educate people?
[00:35:58.098 --> 00:35:59.458]  Does it open minds?
[00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:06.320]  That's more important than being beautiful or speaking with perfect eloquence as an orator.
[00:36:07.561 --> 00:36:09.101]  All of that is important.
[00:36:10.236 --> 00:36:15.138]  But we're looking for people that have that magic spark, that fire of liberty in their heart.
[00:36:15.879 --> 00:36:17.580]  Because I want you to join our team.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:23.183]  I want to give you a launch pad so you can really take off and engage the globalists.
[00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:29.626]  And if this works, we'll have contests all the time and we'll continue to build this operation.
[00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:37.250]  I'm involved in a talent search looking for people who have the fires of liberty burning in their hearts and their minds.
[00:36:38.482 --> 00:36:41.565]  You've got until April 30th to complete your news report.
[00:36:42.206 --> 00:36:44.448]  And then we'll announce the winners one week later.
[00:36:45.308 --> 00:36:47.410]  Are you gonna join the InfoWar?
[00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:49.352]  Do you have what it takes?
[00:36:49.372 --> 00:36:51.134]  It's up to you.
[00:36:53.547 --> 00:36:56.969]  All serious entries will be posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:36:57.709 --> 00:36:58.569]  So everybody wins.
[00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.131]  You're getting the message of liberty out.
[00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:02.651]  And that's what really matters.
[00:37:03.412 --> 00:37:06.913]  But in the final equation, it's not about showing Alex Jones what you got.
[00:37:07.314 --> 00:37:14.257]  It's about showing the world and the globalist that no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[00:37:15.117 --> 00:37:16.798]  Join me in the InfoWar.
[00:37:22.688 --> 00:37:25.012]  So you say you want to fight the Infowar.
[00:37:25.834 --> 00:37:28.578]  You say you want to go head up against the New World Order.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.103]  You can do a better job than Alex Jones?
[00:37:32.165 --> 00:37:33.026]  I know you can.
[00:37:33.908 --> 00:37:35.350]  And here's your chance to prove it.
[00:38:04.078 --> 00:38:10.166]  I really enjoy it when the globalists try to poison us and, well, we resist them via a free market system.
[00:38:11.104 --> 00:38:18.053]  Hello my fellow info warriors, Alex Jones here introducing you to the ProPure family of gravity-fed filters.
[00:38:18.494 --> 00:38:25.463]  Now, you know that the globalists are filling our water with radioactive isotopes, fluoride, lead, mercury, arsenic.
[00:38:26.144 --> 00:38:35.516]  And one of the few systems that can efficiently and economically remove or reduce down to non-detectable levels these poisons are gravity-fed filters.
[00:38:35.957 --> 00:38:38.220]  And ProPure is the top of the line.
[00:38:38.721 --> 00:38:41.304]  Their filters are impregnated with silver.
[00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:43.306]  A natural antibiotic.
[00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:47.328]  On top of that, they're bigger, so they filter faster.
[00:38:47.628 --> 00:38:50.729]  You don't have to prime these the first time you use them.
[00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.750]  It's amazing.
[00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:57.593]  Go to InfoWars.com and click on the shopping cart link to see the entire family of these babies.
[00:38:58.624 --> 00:39:03.626]  Now, the fluoride they add to our water is so tiny that most filters can't cut it out.
[00:39:03.886 --> 00:39:09.849]  But ProPure has their system that will, again, reduce it to non-detectable levels.
[00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:11.829]  Almost get all of it out of there.
[00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.150]  That's also available.
[00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:25.435]  And if you look at the different systems they offer, the ProPure Big Brush Finish is on a stand, so it's easier on a table or at your restaurant or wherever you have it to go up with a glass or a mug and fill it up.
[00:39:25.555 --> 00:39:29.597]  Then there's this big baby right here, the Pro-Pure King large version.
[00:39:29.838 --> 00:39:31.939]  Got a lot of different options that come with it.
[00:39:32.299 --> 00:39:36.622]  Also, they have the Pro-Pure Big, probably one of the best values out there.
[00:39:36.902 --> 00:39:38.883]  And of course, it's burnished stainless steel.
[00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:46.648]  And then, what I use on my RV, something that's great for your hunting cabin or the back porch, is the Pro-Pure Traveler.
[00:39:47.188 --> 00:39:52.375]  Small and portable but packs a huge punch, cleans out all that garbage.
[00:39:52.755 --> 00:39:59.444]  They also have a glass site spigot so you don't have to take the top off and look in the bottom area to see how much water.
[00:39:59.484 --> 00:40:02.949]  You can see how fast it's filtering with this optional system.
[00:40:03.189 --> 00:40:03.850]  The Globalist
[00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.031]  Obviously, you're hitting us through our water.
[00:40:06.332 --> 00:40:08.013]  It's time to take control of our lives.
[00:40:08.273 --> 00:40:16.179]  It's time to not give our children and families these poisons, and these systems cut it down to non-detectable levels across the board.
[00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:18.781]  ProPure is the name.
[00:40:19.301 --> 00:40:21.303]  I only promote what I believe in.
[00:40:21.923 --> 00:40:25.487]  And I use ProPure in my home and my office.
[00:40:25.787 --> 00:40:30.052]  And I recommend that you check out the information on ProPure at Infowars.com.
[00:40:30.272 --> 00:40:36.498]  We already have the lowest price at Infowars.com on the ProPure gravity filter system.
[00:40:37.279 --> 00:40:45.266]  But when you add in the 10% off when InfoWarriors use the product code WATER at InfoWars.com, nobody can top it.
[00:40:45.646 --> 00:40:47.007]  So again, it's a win-win-win.
[00:40:47.067 --> 00:40:55.735]  Stop drinking the poison water, checkmate the globalists when it comes to your health, and support InfoWars.com and the work we're doing here.
[00:40:56.095 --> 00:41:00.378]  You know, many revolutionaries rob banks and things and kidnap people for funds.
[00:41:00.778 --> 00:41:05.362]  We promote in the free market the products we use that are about preparedness.
[00:41:05.702 --> 00:41:15.889]  That's how we fund this revolution against the New World Order in our move to restore our constitutional republic and a spirit of 1776 worldwide.
[00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:17.811]  Check it out at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:26.979]  ProPure, top of the line, number one, most powerful and effective and economical gravity-fed water system in the world.
[00:41:27.279 --> 00:41:31.002]  ProPure, available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:31.282 --> 00:41:33.704]  Don't forget product code WATER to save 10%.
[00:41:34.685 --> 00:41:37.327]  It's the latest generation, years in development.
[00:41:37.768 --> 00:41:39.930]  ProPure is the name.
[00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:46.112]  Welcome back to InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:41:46.212 --> 00:41:47.554]  I'm your host, Rob Dooves.
[00:41:48.054 --> 00:41:54.781]  Sitting over here in Austin, Texas, thanks to Paul Joseph Watson for covering the news and all the issues important to today.
[00:41:54.801 --> 00:42:05.592]  We really appreciate his work out there in England with PrisonPlanet.com and his brother Steve Watson tirelessly working and giving us stuff to cover by the time we get in the office in the morning.
[00:42:05.632 --> 00:42:07.174]  It's a real pleasure working with those guys.
[00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:13.939]  I hope you enjoyed watching those segments of the people who've entered the reporter contest.
[00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:22.632]  If you're interested, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash reporter dash contest and you can look at all the details you have until April 30th.
[00:42:24.073 --> 00:42:24.313]  to get
[00:42:54.273 --> 00:43:03.301]  He's having to deal with some cat issues and cat tags, but he's taking them to court and he's putting it out there so other people can see what he's doing and, you know, sharing information.
[00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:04.542]  That's what it's all about with the Internet.
[00:43:05.743 --> 00:43:08.385]  Our guest today, Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers.
[00:43:09.025 --> 00:43:10.146]  He's the founder of Oath Keepers.
[00:43:10.206 --> 00:43:19.054]  I met him a couple years ago up in Massachusetts where they were having the, what was this, Concord and, Stuart, where were we at then?
[00:43:19.622 --> 00:43:27.409]  We were April 19, 2009 at Lexington Green, where the first shots were fired in the American Revolution.
[00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:28.049]  That's it.
[00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.310]  Thank you for that, Stuart.
[00:43:30.391 --> 00:43:33.114]  So we met him and a bunch of other Oath Keepers there.
[00:43:33.134 --> 00:43:38.519]  It was a great ceremony that we had on the day of the anniversary of the shot heard around the world.
[00:43:38.539 --> 00:43:41.881]  I went over to Concord Bridge, watched the reenactment there.
[00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:43.663]  It was pretty interesting stuff.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.721]  We had to deal with some local issues there.
[00:43:46.741 --> 00:43:47.481]  It was very interesting.
[00:43:47.501 --> 00:43:49.883]  But anyway, I turn to my friend, Stuart Rhodes.
[00:43:49.903 --> 00:43:50.663]  How are you doing, Stuart?
[00:43:51.324 --> 00:43:51.944]  Doing fine.
[00:43:52.024 --> 00:43:55.026]  Speaking of April 19th, yesterday was April 19th.
[00:43:55.626 --> 00:44:03.090]  And oddly enough, or no surprise, Obama and the rest of the federal government made no mention whatsoever of April 19th, 1775.
[00:44:05.371 --> 00:44:05.772]  We're good to go.
[00:44:34.615 --> 00:44:38.157]  Well, they don't want to give real patriots any press, you know.
[00:44:38.197 --> 00:44:39.777]  That would then validate the fight.
[00:44:39.918 --> 00:44:43.399]  That would remind you of a revolution against your own government.
[00:44:43.459 --> 00:44:43.659]  Sure.
[00:44:43.719 --> 00:44:44.940]  That's what we were doing back then.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.541]  We were going against our own government, against the crown.
[00:44:48.021 --> 00:44:51.182]  So no government wants to remind their citizenry about that history.
[00:44:51.423 --> 00:44:52.263]  And what were they doing?
[00:44:52.283 --> 00:44:52.943]  What were they fighting?
[00:44:52.963 --> 00:44:54.324]  They were coming to take their guns.
[00:44:54.744 --> 00:44:59.586]  The British troops were coming to take their guns and the people rose up and said, no, not today.
[00:44:59.946 --> 00:45:00.987]  You're not going to do it to us.
[00:45:02.142 --> 00:45:02.522]  Exactly.
[00:45:02.562 --> 00:45:13.131]  And they're also coming to black bag and enemy combatant, you know, detain John Adams, I mean Sam Adams, and also Hancock.
[00:45:13.692 --> 00:45:15.593]  So they're coming for the Patriot leaders.
[00:45:15.633 --> 00:45:22.099]  They're going to take them off to a Navy ship and take them across the seas to be tried in England.
[00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:25.742]  So the same kind of nonsense we're facing now with the NDAA.
[00:45:25.822 --> 00:45:27.203]  That's what sparked the American Revolution.
[00:45:27.614 --> 00:45:29.014]  Same nonsense, different day.
[00:45:29.034 --> 00:45:35.176]  I want to go to this article that I sent you and that we covered a few days ago, The Facade of Federal Justice.
[00:45:35.216 --> 00:45:44.659]  This was sent to us by one of our listeners up in Montana, and it talks about a Butte, Montana City Judge, Steve Kambich, who was convicted of bribery in federal court.
[00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:51.341]  He receives a $5,000 fine, which was less than the total of his bribes, and five years of probation.
[00:45:52.042 --> 00:45:56.283]  And then they contrast this with the guy, Chris Lindsey, who's facing
[00:45:57.645 --> 00:46:05.041]  690 years to 25 consecutive life sentences, basically for owning firearms and providing medical marijuana to people.
[00:46:05.161 --> 00:46:06.283]  What is going on, Stuart?
[00:46:07.196 --> 00:46:11.217]  Well, this is an example of why the justice system should be called the injustice system.
[00:46:11.237 --> 00:46:25.383]  I mean, first of all, this is a raid on the medical marijuana providers after Eric Holder promised, and Pinky promised, that they would not use federal laws to raid medical marijuana providers.
[00:46:25.643 --> 00:46:31.525]  And these are medical marijuana providers who were operating under state law, totally legal in Montana.
[00:46:31.865 --> 00:46:33.846]  It had been passed by a resolution of the people.
[00:46:34.546 --> 00:46:46.795]  The referendum of the people of Montana who wanted medical marijuana, and so they were operating, you know, both with the promise that the feds wouldn't come get them, and under protection, they thought, of state law being completely legal.
[00:46:47.276 --> 00:46:58.504]  And yet, the feds came in and raided them, and all the local, unfortunately all the local police and sheriff's departments complied and participated and assisted in these unconstitutional raids.
[00:46:58.884 --> 00:47:00.926]  You know, a direct violation of the idea
[00:47:01.446 --> 00:47:05.287]  Of state sovereignty and the separation of powers between the federal government and the states.
[00:47:05.847 --> 00:47:18.589]  And this is where we are because of the growth of the commerce powers through judicial fiat, increasing the power of Congress to now they can regulate almost anything, absolutely anything.
[00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:20.849]  I can't think of one thing they can't regulate.
[00:47:21.149 --> 00:47:29.471]  And so they come in and even though you pass something in your state that legalizes whatever it might be, gun possession, marijuana possession, whatever,
[00:47:30.231 --> 00:47:36.136]  The feds claim they can go ahead and criminalize it at the federal level and come slap you with charges.
[00:47:36.497 --> 00:47:42.722]  And in this case, what they did is they tacked on all these firearms charges because, hey, guess what?
[00:47:43.043 --> 00:47:45.645]  People in Montana have guns and they wanted guns.
[00:47:46.065 --> 00:47:46.846]  I can't believe that.
[00:47:47.287 --> 00:47:48.328]  They have guns in Montana?
[00:47:49.488 --> 00:47:51.389]  I know, outrageous, isn't it?
[00:47:51.429 --> 00:47:51.609]  Wow.
[00:47:51.649 --> 00:48:02.014]  But once you're accused of committing a crime, then they say, well, any gun that is on the premises is a gun that's possessed in furtherance of a crime, and they tack on additional sentences.
[00:48:02.034 --> 00:48:07.677]  And that's why he's facing 25 consecutive life years, plus 85 years.
[00:48:08.117 --> 00:48:13.119]  He's facing like 380 years in prison, or 25 consecutive life years.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.400]  It's an absurdity.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.422]  And you can thank the NRA for this kind of nonsense.
[00:48:17.542 --> 00:48:18.002]  Exactly.
[00:48:18.642 --> 00:48:31.486]  It's always going on about, we've got to make sure that we enforce all the drug, all the gun laws that are in there to the hilt, and make sure that any criminal who uses a gun in the crime gets punished with minimum sentences.
[00:48:31.907 --> 00:48:33.387]  And that's what the NRA has done.
[00:48:33.567 --> 00:48:41.890]  So that means that any of you, or me, all of us, if we were accused of anything by the feds, and we happen to be gun owners, we're going to tack on.
[00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:43.970]  A whole bunch of additional charges.
[00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.651]  And why do they do this?
[00:48:47.111 --> 00:48:50.051]  They're threatening this guy with 25 consecutive life sentences.
[00:48:50.332 --> 00:48:51.792]  What do you think he's going to do?
[00:48:51.932 --> 00:48:53.032]  Is he going to go to trial?
[00:48:53.052 --> 00:48:55.573]  Or are they going to coerce him into a friggin' plea bargain?
[00:48:56.073 --> 00:49:02.154]  So they threaten you with these outrageous sentences to get you to go to a plea bargain, and it's all based on your gun possession.
[00:49:02.394 --> 00:49:07.715]  So this is an example of how the stupidity of conservatives, drug war,
[00:49:08.935 --> 00:49:13.581]  What I think is ridiculous with this conservative mindset is that
[00:49:28.875 --> 00:49:46.109]  If this guy takes jail time, we're then taking a productive member of society out of the workplace, putting him in this controlled prison environment, this prison industrial complex where we have to feed him, clothe him, give him medical care, and this guy didn't do anything, except provide people with medicine.
[00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:56.218]  I mean, I really can't understand it, and this, you know, being 420 and this is like the Smokers' Holiday, which is one of the reasons why I pulled this story out, you know.
[00:49:57.859 --> 00:50:03.700]  To me, in my lifetime, I feel I will have failed if we don't get rid of drug prohibition.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.240]  Especially marijuana.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:18.723]  I mean, if we can't have people getting access to medicine, people using it recreationally, people growing it for fuel, for clothing, most of the basic needs can be met with this plant.
[00:50:18.763 --> 00:50:22.623]  If we don't have that by the time I'm dead, I'm going to feel like a complete failure, honestly.
[00:50:22.663 --> 00:50:23.603]  Because it's a plant.
[00:50:23.884 --> 00:50:26.384]  And it's a useful plant, and we should be using it and growing it.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:35.485]  And under our Constitution, as originally designed by the Founders, you would be able to do so as Montanans did at the state level.
[00:50:35.625 --> 00:50:35.826]  Right.
[00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:44.752]  The Feds have no jurisdiction, they've got no authority, no power under the Constitution to regulate anything that's done inside the state.
[00:50:45.312 --> 00:50:51.116]  If it's not for interstate commerce, if it's just for your own use inside your own state, they have no jurisdiction over it.
[00:50:51.156 --> 00:50:52.797]  But yet they claim jurisdiction over it.
[00:50:53.537 --> 00:50:57.320]  The problem is that under the Founders' original design for a constitutional republic,
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:58.460]  We're good.
[00:51:27.952 --> 00:51:28.412]  We're good to go.
[00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:49.871]  Any law it wants to, but anything it wants to.
[00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:51.872]  And you can thank the drug lawyers for that.
[00:51:52.352 --> 00:52:01.996]  You have the race case, where the woman was growing marijuana in her own backyard, not for sale, not for interstate commerce, just for her own personal use, because she was a suffragette dancer.
[00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:25.874]  And they ruled, because Scalia doesn't like drugs, he sided with the liberals on the court who like federal power, and they ruled, the majority decision, that Congress can regulate even her growing of a plant in her own backyard, not for sale, because they said that her growing that plant impacts the market, the legal market for marijuana, the black market for marijuana.
[00:52:26.195 --> 00:52:27.095]  It's absolutely absurd.
[00:52:27.563 --> 00:52:35.609]  And so, because of the drug lawyers, you now have a wide-open police power, the power to make laws about anything, in Congress.
[00:52:35.769 --> 00:52:36.509]  This is what you get.
[00:52:36.989 --> 00:52:38.891]  And it directly impacts on gun rights.
[00:52:39.351 --> 00:52:45.675]  You have the Meade, Montana gun bill that was passed by the legislature and signed by the governor, signed by Governor Schwartz or a Democrat.
[00:52:46.876 --> 00:52:56.763]  And yet, that's likely to fail in a federal court case, because the court will defer back to the race case and say, well look, if you can regulate a woman growing
[00:52:57.401 --> 00:53:04.043]  A pot plant for her own personal use, not for sale, then surely you can regulate someone manufacturing a firearm in Montana.
[00:53:04.523 --> 00:53:05.864]  So that's what's going to happen with that case.
[00:53:05.904 --> 00:53:20.309]  So, you know, this is the absurdity of the conservative obsession with the drug war that has led to the destruction of the idea of state sovereignty and the idea of people deciding their own way to live in each state.
[00:53:20.751 --> 00:53:21.532]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:53:21.972 --> 00:53:31.679]  The only silver lining I can see to this is right now you have a lot of South American, Central American presidents, former presidents, Vincente Fox just said it, that we need to end the drug war.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.021]  And it's going to happen.
[00:53:34.762 --> 00:53:44.689]  It needs to happen sooner rather than later because we're ruining, you know, we're continuing to ruin lives over this needless ferreting around, digging into people's business and what they want to do with their bodies.
[00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:49.854]  It's a good example.
[00:53:50.094 --> 00:53:57.380]  Back in the 20s, they had to pass a constitutional amendment in order to criminalize alcohol in this country.
[00:53:57.661 --> 00:53:59.862]  And then they realized their mistake and they repealed it.
[00:54:00.223 --> 00:54:00.863]  How quaint.
[00:54:01.264 --> 00:54:03.986]  Nowadays, that's what they should have to do is pass an amendment.
[00:54:04.266 --> 00:54:06.889]  You want to give Congress the power to regulate everything under the sun?
[00:54:06.909 --> 00:54:09.331]  Then sponsor an amendment and get it passed.
[00:54:09.431 --> 00:54:11.393]  Otherwise, go stuff it.
[00:54:12.727 --> 00:54:13.148]  You're right.
[00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:18.917]  Eventually this country will realize that we're making the same exact mistake as during Prohibition.
[00:54:18.957 --> 00:54:20.300]  It's growing the cartels.
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.244]  It's feeding these criminal underground gangs.
[00:54:23.585 --> 00:54:25.889]  It's only going to get worse and it's also growing corruption.
[00:54:27.133 --> 00:54:27.814]  Totally agree.
[00:54:28.514 --> 00:54:30.016]  I'm not going to find any argument there.
[00:54:31.037 --> 00:54:34.921]  Moving on, I get a few emails from people wanting to know an update on the case.
[00:54:35.542 --> 00:54:37.924]  I haven't said anything about it since we went to Pittsburgh.
[00:54:37.964 --> 00:54:43.069]  I made a little video where I went to the spot actually where the incident took place.
[00:54:43.129 --> 00:54:45.612]  I shot some iPhone video.
[00:54:47.765 --> 00:54:49.166]  There it is up on screen now.
[00:54:49.306 --> 00:55:01.151]  It's right in front of the Cathedral of Learning where the Pittsburgh Police and other police agencies around the country came in for this big party to push around Pitt students.
[00:55:01.792 --> 00:55:04.473]  This is after they were done running security for the G20.
[00:55:04.513 --> 00:55:09.075]  So anyway, sir, why don't you give everybody an update on that?
[00:55:10.373 --> 00:55:17.175]  Well, what it does is that they're offering $10,000 as their way of the settlement offer.
[00:55:17.235 --> 00:55:19.676]  That's about the best we're going to get as an offer.
[00:55:19.796 --> 00:55:22.097]  And so, you know, this is AIG on the other side.
[00:55:22.557 --> 00:55:24.558]  That's the insurance company, so it's no surprise.
[00:55:24.778 --> 00:55:25.018]  Yeah.
[00:55:25.198 --> 00:55:27.579]  And so, you know, it's an absurdity as you call it.
[00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:28.359]  What did you call it earlier?
[00:55:28.399 --> 00:55:30.500]  You called it shoe money?
[00:55:32.181 --> 00:55:32.641]  What was that?
[00:55:33.692 --> 00:55:35.032]  Shoofly, buddy, what did you call me?
[00:55:35.152 --> 00:55:35.553]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:55:35.593 --> 00:55:36.613]  Shoofly, get out of here.
[00:55:37.053 --> 00:55:37.633]  Get out of here.
[00:55:37.813 --> 00:55:38.393]  Here's some money.
[00:55:38.493 --> 00:55:38.953]  Get out of here.
[00:55:39.313 --> 00:55:40.674]  Don't stand up for the First Amendment.
[00:55:40.714 --> 00:55:48.536]  And that's kind of what, you know, when we were in that meeting, you know, that's what I felt like it was the entire time.
[00:55:48.656 --> 00:55:54.598]  I felt that it was just, you know, we've got to deal with this person because he actually decided to stand up for himself.
[00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:59.579]  So let's throw him a little bone, get him out of here, and, you know, we can keep
[00:56:00.399 --> 00:56:03.420]  Getting bailout money is until the sun stops shining.
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:06.400]  And, you know, I totally agree with what you said.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.401]  You said, let's fight this.
[00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:08.661]  This is a fight worth fighting.
[00:56:08.701 --> 00:56:10.201]  And it's a First Amendment fight.
[00:56:10.241 --> 00:56:15.322]  So, you know, from here, it'll probably be years before this thing is finally done.
[00:56:15.943 --> 00:56:18.163]  But I think it's a fight worth fighting.
[00:56:18.223 --> 00:56:25.285]  These cops, you know, totally went out of their way to create a situation that was going to breed
[00:56:26.545 --> 00:56:28.666]  People coming out and seeing what was going on.
[00:56:28.686 --> 00:56:31.707]  It was totally going to breed people telling the cops to go home.
[00:56:32.908 --> 00:56:35.069]  By them being there, I think they created the problem.
[00:56:35.489 --> 00:56:37.550]  I don't think there was a problem before that.
[00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:43.472]  There were some people holding a demonstration in a park that could hold those people.
[00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:44.833]  It was only 50 people in the park.
[00:56:45.153 --> 00:56:46.274]  They surrounded the park.
[00:56:47.202 --> 00:56:48.002]  We're good to go.
[00:57:05.931 --> 00:57:11.076]  And, you know, there's a shot that I put online of them letting out a reporter before me.
[00:57:11.557 --> 00:57:12.618]  She showed them a press pass.
[00:57:12.638 --> 00:57:13.639]  They let her through the line.
[00:57:13.739 --> 00:57:17.943]  I walked up right after that with my camera, asking them, you know, hey, I'm pressed too.
[00:57:17.963 --> 00:57:18.704]  Can I get out of here?
[00:57:20.001 --> 00:57:26.887]  And the first guy, you know, said, you're with the press, and started telling me, you know, I have to leave the area, which I was going to comply with.
[00:57:26.927 --> 00:57:29.769]  And then someone else showed up and said, no, he's not with the press, and that was it.
[00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:38.357]  And then it was 10 hours in chains, being talked down to, looked down upon, being cold, thrown out in the rain.
[00:57:38.377 --> 00:57:41.239]  It was 50 degrees that night.
[00:57:41.299 --> 00:57:44.182]  I was only in shorts and a t-shirt, because I didn't even have time to change.
[00:57:44.242 --> 00:57:46.243]  I was covering events the whole day.
[00:57:46.303 --> 00:57:47.785]  I was working my butt off that day.
[00:57:48.385 --> 00:57:50.886]  You know, that's what I do for a living, is cover events.
[00:57:51.266 --> 00:57:57.307]  So, we'll see how that goes, but I'm sure I'm glad I have the head of Oath Keepers on my side for this one.
[00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:03.509]  Well, you know, it's going to be like a fight, we're up against a big dragon, you know, AAG, and they don't care about anything.
[00:58:03.889 --> 00:58:11.071]  The absurd and disgusting thing is that they get to use bailout money from taxpayers to fund the litigation.
[00:58:11.391 --> 00:58:11.631]  Yeah.
[00:58:11.671 --> 00:58:11.911]  You know?
[00:58:12.051 --> 00:58:13.752]  So they're fighting us with their own money.
[00:58:14.514 --> 00:58:14.955]  Exactly.
[00:58:15.155 --> 00:58:19.500]  Defending themselves from us, and we're paying for it.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:20.781]  It's totally ridiculous.
[00:58:20.801 --> 00:58:23.244]  Defending ourselves from the Constitution with our own money.
[00:58:25.017 --> 00:58:28.019]  And I think we're going to have a repeat of this in Chicago.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:40.748]  They're already running war games and drills out there now with Black Hawk helicopters flying around the city at low altitudes with guys sticking, you know, sitting out there with machine guns trying to create that presence of, hey, we're in charge here.
[00:58:41.088 --> 00:58:41.748]  Get out of the way.
[00:58:41.788 --> 00:58:42.929]  We're bringing in world leaders.
[00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:44.370]  Don't speak up about it.
[00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:45.491]  We're going to have fines.
[00:58:45.531 --> 00:58:48.853]  You've got to get permits to even stand on the street and say anything.
[00:58:50.134 --> 00:58:55.057]  It's going to be mayhem, because I think the people at, by this point, you know, Pittsburgh was 09.
[00:58:55.617 --> 00:59:01.540]  There's a lot more people who haven't been working, a lot more people who are hungry, and a lot more people who know who the criminals are now.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:06.483]  So I think you're going to see, you're going to see something going on in Chicago, and it's not going to be nice.
[00:59:06.523 --> 00:59:09.324]  What's your take on what's going on in Chicago with this NATO summit?
[00:59:10.325 --> 00:59:16.628]  Why do they need to have a meeting for NATO in downtown Chicago with all these so-called dignitaries?
[00:59:16.768 --> 00:59:18.830]  What they're really doing is creating a G20 incident.
[00:59:20.206 --> 00:59:24.729]  Let's go close down the downtown area of Chicago, of all places.
[00:59:25.209 --> 00:59:39.518]  And let's make sure that we, because of that, we have all these heightened security alerts, and searches, and coordinates search, and barricades, and guys flying around in choppers, hanging from choppers with submachine guns, who are supposed to have nothing to do with this, but obviously do.
[00:59:40.098 --> 00:59:44.480]  They could have a meeting for NATO in the middle of Kansas someplace.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.401]  Someplace that's not in the middle of a big city.
[00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:49.602]  But no, they want to have a big show.
[00:59:49.702 --> 00:59:54.904]  And they want to have a good excuse to come in there and do the exact same thing they did in G20.
[00:59:55.284 --> 00:59:57.405]  This is dog training for the American people.
[00:59:57.625 --> 00:59:58.845]  We're going to cordon off areas.
[00:59:58.865 --> 00:59:59.926]  We're going to search your bags.
[00:59:59.946 --> 01:00:03.267]  We're going to do what we want because we say it's for security.
[01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:06.368]  And when we say it's for security, we can do whatever we want.
[01:00:06.388 --> 01:00:07.349]  We can TSA you.
[01:00:08.494 --> 01:00:13.158]  Letting us know that, hey, there are certain world elites that trump us.
[01:00:13.678 --> 01:00:14.939]  They're more important than us.
[01:00:14.999 --> 01:00:31.873]  They can go in and blockade a whole city, do all this nonsense, because they're somehow superior to the rest of us, and we better get in line and submit to the searches and submit to their free speech zones someplace outside of the area where they're going to be, all that kind of nonsense.
[01:00:32.233 --> 01:00:34.655]  It's as though each one of those foreign, you know,
[01:00:35.191 --> 01:00:37.358]  Officials were the President of the United States.
[01:00:37.438 --> 01:00:42.031]  They treated him with the same kind of care and the same kind of deference.
[01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:43.346]  Yeah, it's sick.
[01:00:43.386 --> 01:00:52.473]  And now we've got in Houston, Sheila Jackson Lee is partnering up with the DHS and they're going to put TSA workers in disguises on city buses.
[01:00:52.693 --> 01:00:56.496]  I mean, that is just ridiculous beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[01:00:56.556 --> 01:01:05.363]  I can't even believe that I'm reading this story in 2012, that we're going to have secret police running around trying to catch people, doing whatever, whatever.
[01:01:05.443 --> 01:01:07.384]  I mean, being people.
[01:01:07.524 --> 01:01:09.586]  People are mad that the economy is not good?
[01:01:11.263 --> 01:01:16.647]  Yeah, I mean, there's no crime even being committed, unless riding on a bus is a crime now.
[01:01:16.687 --> 01:01:18.208]  I mean, did that become a crime in Houston?
[01:01:18.328 --> 01:01:18.748]  I don't know.
[01:01:18.788 --> 01:01:21.030]  But now we have to have police officers on the buses?
[01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:23.971]  And they're not even police officers in uniform.
[01:01:24.012 --> 01:01:25.913]  They're fake police officers.
[01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:28.514]  They don't take an oath to the Constitution.
[01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:42.703]  They have a fake badge, they have this fake authority given to them by the federal government and the DHS, Janet Dungbeil Napolitano, and they're going to be going around looking for things to do.
[01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:44.985]  They're going to be looking for crimes.
[01:01:45.026 --> 01:01:46.587]  This is pre-crime on a whole new level.
[01:01:46.627 --> 01:01:47.448]  What's your take on that?
[01:01:48.644 --> 01:01:58.988]  Yeah, what I've been talking about, looking for a situation where they have probable cause that a crime has been committed, or particular people or places to be searched, this is direct violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:01:59.008 --> 01:02:05.870]  This is exactly the kind of phishing expedition and suppression and intimidation that the Fourth Amendment was meant to stop.
[01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:09.271]  When the founders had gone through the warrantless searches,
[01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:10.068]  I think so.
[01:02:27.106 --> 01:02:36.871]  Yeah, it's the totalitarian tiptoe and it's happening every day, every week.
[01:02:37.051 --> 01:02:41.874]  They just notch it up a little bit so maybe some people don't see it, so they don't care.
[01:02:42.394 --> 01:02:53.841]  Some people are affected by it but they're such a small minority that they can't speak out or they don't speak out and it just keeps going and going and going and pretty soon in 10 years we're going to look back and go, how the hell did we get here?
[01:02:54.321 --> 01:02:56.063]  You know, we're all wearing tracker bracelets.
[01:02:56.363 --> 01:02:58.224]  Our cars are going to have tracker chips in them.
[01:02:58.304 --> 01:03:00.767]  I mean, it's just, it's beyond the pale at this point.
[01:03:01.627 --> 01:03:02.548]  Look, go to the airport.
[01:03:02.608 --> 01:03:05.190]  That's what America is going to be eventually everywhere.
[01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:05.931]  Yeah.
[01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:08.033]  And eventually they'll have sidewalk checkpoints.
[01:03:08.173 --> 01:03:09.714]  Landmark checkpoints on the sidewalk.
[01:03:10.014 --> 01:03:14.118]  You have to go through a metal detector and get patted down and felt up by some guy with blue gloves on.
[01:03:14.498 --> 01:03:15.439]  That's what they want.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.843]  The long-term goal is to make all of America like an airport.
[01:03:20.697 --> 01:03:23.280]  Well, some people are fighting back, yourself included.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:30.768]  You've got a site called theintolerableacts.org, and you're helping people write NDAA nullification legislation.
[01:03:31.569 --> 01:03:35.613]  We just had a bill passed in Virginia, which is ready to be signed.
[01:03:35.693 --> 01:03:36.935]  It's passed the House and Senate.
[01:03:37.675 --> 01:03:42.581]  We had one just passed in... How's the one going in Arizona right now?
[01:03:43.277 --> 01:03:48.800]  Well, as far as I know, the past year, Arizona legislature as well is waiting for Jan Brewer, the governor, to sign it.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.422]  We're urging her to sign that piece of legislation.
[01:03:52.262 --> 01:04:06.230]  I co-authored a model bill along with Richard Frey, Patriot Coalition, and it's being considered in Oklahoma, North Carolina, and also in Kansas, and I'm flying out to Kansas on Wednesday to testify at a hearing on that bill.
[01:04:07.232 --> 01:04:14.596]  And people can go to the site IntolerableActs.org to find information and you've got resolutions written for all types of situations.
[01:04:14.636 --> 01:04:15.777]  Tell everybody a little bit about that.
[01:04:15.797 --> 01:04:16.998]  Absolutely.
[01:04:17.018 --> 01:04:19.379]  We've got resolutions there for your county sheriff's sign.
[01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:29.245]  He can just go ahead and pass his own resolution nullifying NDAA and pledging to defend the people of his county against any such attempt to kidnap them.
[01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:30.105]  I'm good.
[01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:39.030]  Well, that's good.
[01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:40.911]  I'm glad people are fighting back.
[01:04:41.292 --> 01:04:43.753]  We get a lot of updates from the Tenth Amendment Center.
[01:04:43.833 --> 01:04:47.875]  They seem to be taking a lead on this as well, in addition to yourself.
[01:04:48.456 --> 01:04:50.937]  So, people are fighting back, and that is a good sign.
[01:04:51.438 --> 01:04:52.558]  I think we're going to beat this stuff.
[01:04:52.578 --> 01:04:57.921]  We've just got to keep shining a light on the roaches and just making them scatter, because when they're scattering, they're not coming after us.
[01:04:57.941 --> 01:05:00.022]  They're trying to hide their tail and run.
[01:05:00.543 --> 01:05:04.685]  Stuart Rhodes of OathKeepers.org, thank you very much, and we'll be talking to you in the future.
[01:05:05.265 --> 01:05:05.686]  Good to go.
[01:05:05.706 --> 01:05:05.926]  Thank you.
[01:05:06.823 --> 01:05:14.470]  Great interview with Stuart, he's a good friend of mine, and check out that site intolerableacts.org and start talking to your state legislatures.
[01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:22.457]  Let's get this thing, this NDAA, these provisions to black bag Americans and take them away without trial, just being accused of a crime.
[01:05:22.797 --> 01:05:26.820]  Let's get that stopped and let these people know that they can't just treat us like slaves.
[01:05:27.381 --> 01:05:28.962]  And with that, we're going to go to the quote of the day.
[01:05:29.162 --> 01:05:30.424]  In honor of 420, we've got Willie Nelson.
[01:05:34.599 --> 01:05:39.125]  I think people need to be educated to the fact that marijuana is not a drug.
[01:05:39.906 --> 01:05:41.928]  Marijuana is a herb and a flower.
[01:05:42.969 --> 01:05:43.790]  God put it here.
[01:05:44.371 --> 01:05:50.298]  If he put it here and he wants it to grow, what gives the government the right to say that God is wrong?
[01:05:50.739 --> 01:05:52.902]  Willie Nelson, quote on marijuana.
[01:05:54.178 --> 01:05:55.319]  Happy 420, everybody!
[01:05:55.379 --> 01:05:56.239]  It's the end of our week.
[01:05:56.259 --> 01:05:57.200]  We had a lot of news.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.260]  This is a great week.
[01:05:58.781 --> 01:06:04.764]  We put together a lot of stuff, and we're going to keep coming and doing it every day of the week as long as we can.

[01:06:23.875 --> 01:06:24.735]  We went on time.

[01:06:30.317 --> 01:06:31.417]  We're working out the kinks.
[01:06:31.857 --> 01:06:32.898]  We're making stuff happen.
[01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:39.079]  We're building really cool graphics and hopefully bringing you the information to empower yourselves out there because that's the most important thing.
[01:06:39.419 --> 01:06:40.700]  It's not how flashy it looks.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:46.662]  It's are we giving you information to help yourself in your life and escape tyranny when you can.
[01:06:47.362 --> 01:06:48.342]  With that, I'm Rob Due.
[01:06:48.822 --> 01:06:51.403]  Thank you very much for watching CINFO Wars Nightly News.
