[00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:10.078]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.078 --> 00:00:11.679]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.219]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.401]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.523]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:55.782]  It is Friday the 16th day of March 2012 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:55.782 --> 00:01:02.824]  I am going to attempt to at least mention the headline and give you an analysis comment on all these articles I've got here because it's
[00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.875]  It's all very, very important, and some of it extremely interesting.
[00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:16.498]  Like, I'd rather focus on things like a record skydive from 13 miles above the Earth in a space suit.
[00:01:16.498 --> 00:01:21.480]  Incredible photos that are with that article.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.182]  And radio listeners can watch it, PrisonPlanet.tv, when we get to that.
[00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:29.677]  a little bit later.
[00:01:29.677 --> 00:01:40.686]  We are going to have a congressperson joining us later in the second hour to deal with some very important developments in Congress, but I'll just leave it at that.
[00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:53.619]  And then we are going to have Patrick Henningsen, who's an American but who's visiting here from England, where he writes for InfoWars.com.
[00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:02.783]  He is going to be joining us and overlapping with a lady that goes by the Ugandan Girl.
[00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:16.562]  Who's video, one version, has been seen over three million times, where she says, look, what you're seeing in this Kony 2012 film is not the reality of what's going on.
[00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:28.552]  Now, expanding on that information, George Clooney has gone to the White House, and they're doing all this as part of a coordinated campaign.
[00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:31.124]  The County 2012 thing comes out.
[00:02:31.124 --> 00:02:33.325]  Oh, here's the new demon we've got to invade.
[00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:35.567]  Oh, AFRICOM wants to go into nine countries.
[00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.748]  Oh, the French and the Australians and the British Special Forces and U.S.
[00:02:38.748 --> 00:02:40.750]  Special Forces are already there.
[00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:56.559]  Oh, they just had a conviction at the World Court, ICC, which is totally illegitimate, with Angelina Jolie there, angrily, you know, in the gallery, glaring at the criminal because she is a wondrous
[00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:59.043]  Good little hero.
[00:02:59.043 --> 00:03:05.945]  And we need the ICC to arrest more people and also for environmental crimes and world government is the answer.
[00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:21.468]  And then George Clooney, he goes to the White House and he comes out and says, oh my gosh, I'm spurring the president to want to do something militarily in Sudan.
[00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:25.629]  So it's there to create the perception that the people
[00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:35.251]  Are calling for these wars and that the wars are humanitarian when you read the State Department documents that we go over, the different memorandums.
[00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:45.435]  It's all about going in there and overthrowing countries or propping up countries that are doing what the globalists want and taking out groups of people who are good, bad, indifferent.
[00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:52.681]  It varies in the name of humanitarianism, but it's all about natural resource power grabs.
[00:03:52.681 --> 00:04:06.753]  And then some send me emails, a minority of people, and they say, well, Alex, we need to be in places like Uganda, because you know what?
[00:04:06.753 --> 00:04:10.317]  Even though our government's bad, Joseph Kony's bad, and he needs to be dealt with.
[00:04:11.241 --> 00:04:13.782]  And besides, we do need those resources.
[00:04:13.782 --> 00:04:17.524]  There's this idea like, well, it's humanitarian, but hey, we're getting something.
[00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:23.987]  I mean, I've had good old boys for years go, hey, Alex, I know it's probably immoral to be in Iraq, but we need the oil.
[00:04:23.987 --> 00:04:26.308]  We don't get the oil.
[00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:29.449]  It's all about the big oil companies keeping prices high.
[00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.992]  They've been caught doing that, being able to create cartels and shut down the amount.
[00:04:33.992 --> 00:04:36.473]  They were mad at Saddam because he was, quote, over pumping.
[00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:36.853]  Remember that?
[00:04:38.587 --> 00:04:45.353]  OPEC kept getting mad because he wanted to pay off his debts for the Iran-Iraq War, so he was selling more than what OPEC said he could.
[00:04:45.353 --> 00:04:47.215]  Remember how low oil prices were?
[00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:50.197]  They fixed that, though, before the Iraq War eight years ago.
[00:04:50.197 --> 00:04:51.659]  What was gas like?
[00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.360]  $2 a gallon?
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.842]  Oh, you sure got that free oil, didn't you?
[00:04:55.842 --> 00:04:59.646]  No, you got ripped off, because the big oil companies hate you as much as they hate the Iraqis.
[00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:07.738]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.738 --> 00:05:12.882]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:21.610]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.674]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:25.674 --> 00:05:28.036]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:34.685]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:38.527]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:05:38.527 --> 00:05:39.768]  Others don't.
[00:05:39.768 --> 00:05:41.909]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.690]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.571]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:50.813]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:05:50.813 --> 00:05:53.195]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:55.896]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.896 --> 00:05:58.277]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:05:58.277 --> 00:05:59.158]  Others don't.
[00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:07.690]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:25.579]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:29.681]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:31.722]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:06:31.722 --> 00:06:39.908]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:06:39.908 --> 00:06:46.212]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:47.473]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:48.373]  It's incredible.
[00:06:48.373 --> 00:06:57.580]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.401]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:04.702]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.702 --> 00:07:05.622]  Number one.
[00:07:05.622 --> 00:07:09.023]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:09.023 --> 00:07:09.903]  Number two.
[00:07:09.903 --> 00:07:14.784]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:15.524]  It's true.
[00:07:15.524 --> 00:07:20.405]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:21.225]  Number three.
[00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:24.805]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:28.506]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:29.507]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.507 --> 00:07:32.270]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.954]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:36.755]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:40.900]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.665]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.945 --> 00:07:50.107]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.107 --> 00:07:51.887]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:54.148]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:56.989]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.989 --> 00:08:04.492]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.492 --> 00:08:07.313]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:19.765]  We've got a power-packed transmission lined up for you today.
[00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:22.227]  We have a congressperson joining us.
[00:08:22.227 --> 00:08:26.010]  I'm just going to leave that as a surprise.
[00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.212]  And it deals with an issue that has been on our radar screen in a big way.
[00:08:29.212 --> 00:08:30.933]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:36.057]  But we're going to surprise you with that congressional visit to the show.
[00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.879]  And that is lockdown, correct Chris?
[00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:41.718]  100% that's locked down to that Congress.
[00:08:41.718 --> 00:08:43.100]  Congressman's on?
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.482]  Okay, good.
[00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.343]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:08:45.343 --> 00:08:45.743]  That's good.
[00:08:45.743 --> 00:08:49.588]  I just want to leave it as a surprise because, well, I have my reasons.
[00:08:49.588 --> 00:08:53.553]  Now that's coming up later in the broadcast in the second hour.
[00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:56.877]  Sunia, a young lady from Uganda.
[00:08:58.243 --> 00:09:00.926]  Who has, uh, both her parents are from Uganda.
[00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:05.351]  She has put out a very eloquent video, and I've done the research, it's very accurate.
[00:09:05.351 --> 00:09:13.640]  It's been seen more than three million times, countering the Kony 2012 State Department, Bill and Melinda Gates, George Soros.
[00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:23.133]  Invasion propaganda and she's going to be popping in with us as is our writer Patrick Henningsen who is visiting the United States.
[00:09:23.133 --> 00:09:35.418]  He is a US citizen but he works in England and he's going to be joining us in studio to talk about Coney 2012 and these new proxy wars being launched around the world.
[00:09:35.418 --> 00:09:36.359]  It doesn't mean that
[00:09:37.319 --> 00:09:38.399]  Kony's a good guy.
[00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:41.521]  It just means this war is about resource grabbing.
[00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:42.701]  That's why we're against it.
[00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:45.922]  We're not saying that Qaddafi is a good guy.
[00:09:45.922 --> 00:09:48.964]  The point is he was working with the West, building up his country.
[00:09:48.964 --> 00:09:51.465]  Now it is in a bombed out shambles.
[00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:53.085]  Exactly what the globalists wanted.
[00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:55.366]  They were not trying to bring freedom.
[00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:57.207]  Qaddafi was not attacking protesters.
[00:09:58.147 --> 00:10:05.531]  In fact, they were Al-Qaeda forces armed by the West, and that's now admitted, even in the LA Times.
[00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:07.231]  And they're lining the blacks up and killing them.
[00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.272]  That's why we were against that war.
[00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:23.999]  We're not saying that the quasi-dictator Assad, who by the way has been reforming, that's why he's being rewarded with this, he did take the iron fist off, and that let the West bring in its CIA, Mossad, MI6 agitators.
[00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:25.120]  So all of that
[00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:30.389]  is going on and that's why we've been against all these humanitarian wars.
[00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:36.753]  Now, I'm going to get into all the other world news and open the phones up here because we're going to be covering this in the third hour.
[00:10:36.753 --> 00:10:46.459]  I just wanted to point out to everybody that you know when they're about to launch new wars because you see the propaganda provocations.
[00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:54.104]  And when you see Kony12 come out last week, now about 10 days ago, you see all the mainstream corporate media praising it.
[00:10:54.935 --> 00:10:58.796]  You see the colleges flooded with the propaganda.
[00:10:58.796 --> 00:11:01.517]  They're here at South by Southwest in Austin.
[00:11:01.517 --> 00:11:04.258]  Posters, trucks, huge money behind it.
[00:11:04.258 --> 00:11:07.499]  It's not about helping Africans.
[00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:15.701]  When all this globalist money, George Soros, Bill and Melinda Gates, all of them get behind something, it's being done to launch a new war.
[00:11:17.256 --> 00:11:22.402]  And we've now confirmed doing the research and we've written articles about it.
[00:11:22.402 --> 00:11:26.446]  I've done a video titled Secrets Coney 2012 is Desperate to Hide.
[00:11:26.446 --> 00:11:33.154]  It's up at Infowars.com that breaks down every facet of this.
[00:11:37.048 --> 00:11:40.991]  We prove that, well quite frankly, it was worse than I even thought a week ago.
[00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:55.140]  That it's purely Samantha Powers at the White House, purely the big tax-free foundations, and there's all these white papers where they say, we're going to rebrand war as peace, we're going to call it humanitarian, we're going to fund proxy groups to attack governments we want to get rid of.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:02.524]  Then we're going to say that they're peaceful protesters as they use the machine guns we gave them and rocket launchers to blow stuff up.
[00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:08.008]  Then we're going to come in with special forces and aircraft behind them and overthrow the governments.
[00:12:08.008 --> 00:12:09.389]  Or, if we're for a government,
[00:12:10.276 --> 00:12:13.580]  Like the Ugandan genocidal government of 26 years.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:23.111]  But that government's having trouble with our weapons, killing all the villagers and running all the people off their land, where people actually have the deed and title of their land.
[00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:28.336]  When these tribes give us trouble, we'll just say, hey, we'll pick somebody like Kony, hadn't been seen in almost six years.
[00:12:29.714 --> 00:12:38.622]  And we'll just hype up, hey, there's a bad man, five minutes of hate directly out of 1984, and attack the country.
[00:12:38.622 --> 00:12:39.923]  And so that's what's going on.
[00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:41.124]  That's what's happening.
[00:12:41.124 --> 00:12:44.667]  That's what's developing right now.
[00:12:44.667 --> 00:12:46.209]  And we're going to be breaking it down.
[00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:49.091]  We're going to be covering it.
[00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:52.934]  Now, right on clockwork,
[00:12:54.036 --> 00:12:56.297]  Exactly as we predicted.
[00:12:56.297 --> 00:13:06.343]  You got Kony 2012 come out, you've got the ICC announcing a conviction of an African warlord for using child soldiers, which I'm not saying is good, but they all do it.
[00:13:06.343 --> 00:13:10.125]  That's better than the UN just lining you up and blowing your head off or finding a group to do it.
[00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:11.906]  But again, that's trendy and liberal when you do that.
[00:13:11.906 --> 00:13:16.709]  You know, when you shoot people up with HIV or shoot them up with sterilants, that's nice.
[00:13:16.709 --> 00:13:20.971]  When you shoot them up with live polio and they die, you know, that's nice.
[00:13:20.971 --> 00:13:22.312]  When you cut off their resources,
[00:13:23.638 --> 00:13:25.820]  And fund a country to attack its neighbor?
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.381]  That's nice!
[00:13:27.612 --> 00:13:36.015]  Because, you know, it's all right because for every, you know, group of people you slaughter, you have a bunch of the starving kids that you've actually cut the food off to.
[00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:46.538]  Then you pull up with a truck, set up a tent, and have Angelina Jolie or George Clooney get out there and drop some rice in their hands as the little skeletal people dying, you know, beg for food.
[00:13:46.538 --> 00:13:49.398]  And people say, look at those Africans, they don't even know how to feed themselves.
[00:13:49.398 --> 00:13:51.719]  You know, why don't they go where there's food?
[00:13:51.719 --> 00:13:54.600]  Well, they can't go where there's food because they're under attack.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:09.102]  Then the UN will use the last mass murder that they've organized, just as Memorandum 200 out of the State Department stated, use war, use famine, use proxy armies, use neighbors attacking neighbors to reduce population.
[00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:16.424]  They then point at the carnage and say, oh my gosh, raise money for us to protect everyone.
[00:14:16.424 --> 00:14:20.504]  Raise money for us to go in and help people.
[00:14:20.504 --> 00:14:24.285]  And they, they, for every
[00:14:27.463 --> 00:14:34.825]  Group of people that they engage in carnage against versus who they actually help.
[00:14:34.825 --> 00:14:49.389]  There are some people that the UN and these orphanages and people actually help, but that's always done just for appearances and just enough to get the trendies in Hollywood and in the clothing lines and in the cosmetic industries.
[00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.029]  I mean, it is the big cause celeb.
[00:14:51.029 --> 00:14:52.270]  It's a giant industry.
[00:14:53.010 --> 00:15:03.514]  That all these big celebs, many of them have these large tax-free foundations, where they actually, their helicopters, their homes, their businesses, are all tax-free.
[00:15:03.514 --> 00:15:12.038]  And they'll be like Bono, who gives less than 1.5% of the profits, which are tax-free, to the Africans.
[00:15:12.038 --> 00:15:14.819]  And then when that's done, it's only for PR purposes.
[00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:18.297]  And Bill and Melinda Gates do the same thing.
[00:15:18.297 --> 00:15:20.319]  It is totally cold-blooded.
[00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:26.344]  Instead of paying taxes, Bill and Melinda Gates put $80 billion in a tax-free foundation.
[00:15:26.344 --> 00:15:34.871]  And then, now their businesses operate and make profits, and then only part of the profit actually goes to help the Africans.
[00:15:34.871 --> 00:15:39.075]  So, I've been spending a lot of time on this because the big rollout has happened now.
[00:15:39.075 --> 00:15:40.516]  You know, in the Obama deception,
[00:15:43.203 --> 00:15:57.927]  Three and a half years ago, we laid out how under the name of humanitarian intervention and going after strongmen that they would invade and we list Uganda, we list Sudan, we list Libya, we list Egypt.
[00:15:57.927 --> 00:16:02.909]  We show and list who they're going to invade and how they're going to do it.
[00:16:02.909 --> 00:16:03.789]  And you know how we did that?
[00:16:05.219 --> 00:16:14.129]  The very State Department that was in charge then, even though Bush had just left office, we were making the film when he was still President and Obama was President-elect.
[00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:15.170]  We knew the policy.
[00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.012]  We knew the next phase.
[00:16:17.012 --> 00:16:21.477]  They were going to switch from overt, we've got to attack all these countries because WMDs and Al Qaeda.
[00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:27.868]  To, oh, Al-Qaeda's now good, and we're going to use Al-Qaeda in all these countries.
[00:16:27.868 --> 00:16:37.598]  Sometimes they use Al-Qaeda to attack the government, other times they say we're going to invade because of Al-Qaeda, when Al-Qaeda publicly works for them, or they say we've got to get this Christian warlord
[00:16:38.746 --> 00:16:41.127]  With the Lord's Resistance Army, Joseph Kony.
[00:16:41.127 --> 00:16:44.188]  So it doesn't matter because the public's not really paying attention.
[00:16:44.188 --> 00:16:45.649]  It's just, hey, here's a new guy.
[00:16:45.649 --> 00:16:46.349]  He's worse than Hitler.
[00:16:46.349 --> 00:16:47.489]  We're going to invade.
[00:16:47.489 --> 00:16:52.991]  And you can always tell it's telltale because they love a boogeyman nobody's seen for years.
[00:16:52.991 --> 00:16:55.132]  That's a big telltale.
[00:16:55.132 --> 00:17:01.535]  Because somebody who isn't really dead or isn't in some secret prison, they're going to speak out.
[00:17:01.535 --> 00:17:03.995]  They're not going to play along.
[00:17:03.995 --> 00:17:07.837]  So the telltale sign of a Bin Laden or a Kony is they're already dead.
[00:17:09.185 --> 00:17:16.228]  And so, but you use a boogeyman who's dead because then they can't argue.
[00:17:16.228 --> 00:17:21.491]  And that's why Ugandans all over the country, I mean, it's all over the news, are going, well, none of this is even true.
[00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:25.212]  Nobody's seen this guy in almost six years and he was a very small force at the time.
[00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:33.296]  And whatever's left of his group is on a couple hundred square miles in the north and isn't even a factor.
[00:17:33.296 --> 00:17:34.317]  Well, what is this?
[00:17:35.439 --> 00:17:37.980]  Our problem is the government's taking our property.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.981]  But that's the cover.
[00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:39.601]  Why are U.S.
[00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:40.602]  troops going to be there?
[00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:43.043]  Why is increased funding going to take place?
[00:17:43.043 --> 00:17:47.885]  Because they're going to move people off their land at gunpoint.
[00:17:47.885 --> 00:17:49.346]  And that's admitted.
[00:17:49.346 --> 00:17:51.947]  And that's why I get angry at Angelina Jolie and George Clooney.
[00:17:51.947 --> 00:17:55.108]  Now, you've seen all this rollout, all this PR.
[00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:56.249]  What's the government going to do?
[00:17:56.249 --> 00:17:57.910]  Making it look like it's the people.
[00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.151]  And I'm not saying what's happening in Sudan is good.
[00:18:01.209 --> 00:18:05.431]  You've got the Muslims killing Christians for a very, very long time.
[00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:09.692]  You've got the left quietly involved financing both sides.
[00:18:09.692 --> 00:18:12.733]  I don't like what the Muslim groups are doing there to Christians.
[00:18:12.733 --> 00:18:14.734]  This isn't even, for me, a Muslim-Christian issue.
[00:18:14.734 --> 00:18:19.776]  It's just that that's the... Just like they use Muslims as the pretext to go after the Serbs.
[00:18:19.776 --> 00:18:22.677]  I'm not saying the Serbs were blameless or guiltless.
[00:18:22.677 --> 00:18:30.360]  The point is that if you look at the numbers, the Croats and the Muslims, roughly, and the UN admits this, killed double what the Serbs did in all those conflicts.
[00:18:31.738 --> 00:18:33.719]  In the Balkans.
[00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:36.401]  So why did the UN side with the Muslims in that case?
[00:18:36.401 --> 00:18:41.324]  Because they were going after the most powerful group in the area, the Serbs, to break them up and weaken them.
[00:18:41.324 --> 00:18:44.266]  The globalists admit their strategy is micro-stakes.
[00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:48.669]  The globalists admit that it's a strategy of tension and of inter-sectarian fighting.
[00:18:49.505 --> 00:19:02.273]  And so, now you see George Clooney, he goes to the White House, he says, I think Obama's gonna do something about Sudan, right as all this is being launched, right as we're hearing, oh, AFRICOM's going in, after the bases are built and set up.
[00:19:02.273 --> 00:19:10.379]  This is the new beachhead, going into Uganda, going into Sudan, going in to Tanzania, going into Kenya, they're talking about.
[00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:11.640]  Kenya.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.962]  And again, the West will destabilize it through proxies and then come in.
[00:19:15.962 --> 00:19:17.964]  Now he's been arrested at the Sudanese embassy.
[00:19:18.684 --> 00:19:19.785]  Storming the embassy.
[00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:22.966]  He tried to walk in and talk to them.
[00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:25.067]  Notice they arrested him because they wanted publicity.
[00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:29.929]  They didn't arrest me twice when I stormed the Texas Capitol over the TSA.
[00:19:29.929 --> 00:19:32.530]  Because they knew it was a unifying issue that everybody's angry about.
[00:19:33.638 --> 00:19:38.260]  And the police were told to just stand down as I marched there with hundreds of people screaming at them.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.280]  Screaming at the politicians.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.521]  I went in the governor's office and screamed at them.
[00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:43.261]  But they'd all been told to stand down.
[00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:45.962]  Don't give Jones attention on a real issue.
[00:19:45.962 --> 00:19:48.063]  But on the Clooney thing, oh my gosh!
[00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.083]  Poor guy got arrested.
[00:19:49.083 --> 00:19:50.404]  He's this hero.
[00:19:50.404 --> 00:19:51.644]  Clooney is smart.
[00:19:51.644 --> 00:19:54.685]  He knows full well he's a globalist operative.
[00:19:54.685 --> 00:19:58.866]  He's about as liberal as Richard Nixon.
[00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:00.767]  I mean, it's just a total actor front.
[00:20:02.363 --> 00:20:05.745]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[00:24:49.031 --> 00:24:51.293]  And coming up, Greece on the breadline.
[00:24:51.293 --> 00:24:54.676]  HIV and malaria make a comeback.
[00:24:54.676 --> 00:24:56.137]  Malaria!
[00:24:56.137 --> 00:24:59.580]  In the Mediterranean, people are starving to death.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.263]  People are dumping their kids out on the street.
[00:25:02.263 --> 00:25:05.245]  Austerity is meant to shut down your economy.
[00:25:05.245 --> 00:25:07.587]  Most of the debt was not their debt.
[00:25:07.587 --> 00:25:11.010]  It was the debt of the big mega-banks that took control of their country.
[00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.171]  And you want to see our future?
[00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:14.313]  It's Greece.
[00:25:14.313 --> 00:25:16.355]  The National Park's going to private bankers.
[00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:19.262]  Not even to Goldman Sachs.
[00:25:19.262 --> 00:25:20.203]  This is the future.
[00:25:20.203 --> 00:25:21.944]  I'm going to be breaking that down.
[00:25:21.944 --> 00:25:27.167]  This is what they want to do here, and this is what they'll get away with if we let them.
[00:25:27.167 --> 00:25:31.030]  Now, just briefly, finishing up with this whole new PR rollout.
[00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.631]  You've heard of WMDs in Iraq.
[00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:34.672]  You've heard of babies thrown out of incubators.
[00:25:34.672 --> 00:25:40.976]  You've heard of Gaddafi rape gangs and people fueled by Viagra.
[00:25:40.976 --> 00:25:42.417]  All lies.
[00:25:42.417 --> 00:25:44.879]  But you find out it's a lie after the war is launched.
[00:25:46.021 --> 00:25:49.082]  That's why when you're talking to known liars, you're an idiot.
[00:25:49.082 --> 00:25:55.523]  If after someone's lied to you hundreds of times and been caught, then you still trust them.
[00:25:55.523 --> 00:26:00.345]  I think people just feel powerless, so they just decide to be comfortable with the fact that you're being lied to.
[00:26:00.345 --> 00:26:03.565]  But George Clooney arrested at Sudanese embassy.
[00:26:03.565 --> 00:26:09.827]  So he goes over to Obama's White House office and says, I want you to do something about the problems in Sudan.
[00:26:10.655 --> 00:26:19.243]  And the answer is, well, we'll just send in the United Nations to arrest the leader there.
[00:26:19.243 --> 00:26:23.027]  And what does Kony say?
[00:26:23.027 --> 00:26:24.088]  Kony says the same thing.
[00:26:24.088 --> 00:26:26.690]  They say, look, this is about awareness of all of Africa.
[00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.072]  We want to help people everywhere.
[00:26:28.072 --> 00:26:30.354]  And there's Clooney with the Kony.
[00:26:32.349 --> 00:26:34.712]  The Clooney-Koney connection.
[00:26:34.712 --> 00:26:36.334]  He's the good humanitarian.
[00:26:36.334 --> 00:26:37.836]  He's the good actor.
[00:26:37.836 --> 00:26:39.898]  He's the one that cares about you.
[00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:42.141]  He supports taking your guns.
[00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:44.865]  He supports taking your property, Agenda 21.
[00:26:44.865 --> 00:26:46.266]  He supports open borders.
[00:26:46.266 --> 00:26:47.768]  He supports globalism.
[00:26:47.768 --> 00:26:49.050]  He's a good guy.
[00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.213]  The corporate whore media told you so.
[00:26:53.288 --> 00:26:57.272]  And he's nothing but a manufactured globalist.
[00:26:57.272 --> 00:27:02.036]  He's nothing but an empty suit who thinks you're all a big joke.
[00:27:02.036 --> 00:27:08.662]  And let me tell you, somebody like Clooney, who is smart, he knows full well the stunts he's pulling.
[00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:21.874]  He knows full well what he's doing, and it's sick they get off on this idea of being these selfless, caring, good people, and Angelina Jolie.
[00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:26.896]  Now, I'm not calling for George Clooney's arrest because he's not officially an envoy of the UN.
[00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:36.500]  He doesn't officially go stand at the dock when they're, you know, convicting somebody in a kangaroo court, calling them the bad man, but the UN doing, you know, a hundred to one murder is the good guy.
[00:27:37.512 --> 00:27:45.339]  She's an actual agent of this going to Tunisia for months agitating for war with Libya and destroying their infrastructure.
[00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:48.361]  She goes and agitates for an invasion of Syria.
[00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:50.963]  She goes and agitates for a war against Iran.
[00:27:50.963 --> 00:27:57.589]  She goes and agitates for an invasion of Uganda to back up the government sweeping the people.
[00:27:57.589 --> 00:27:59.571]  She is an agent of this.
[00:27:59.571 --> 00:28:00.832]  Clooney's got his free speech.
[00:28:03.017 --> 00:28:08.342]  Oh, let's, you know, let a humanitarian mission come into Sudan.
[00:28:08.342 --> 00:28:12.346]  You saw the humanitarian mission of Libya, right?
[00:28:12.346 --> 00:28:14.308]  They said, well, bombing is kinetic action.
[00:28:14.308 --> 00:28:15.649]  It's not war.
[00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:18.571]  And yeah, we're bombing apartment buildings and all of this.
[00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:19.472]  But you know what?
[00:28:19.472 --> 00:28:22.015]  Qaddafi might have roughed up some protesters.
[00:28:22.015 --> 00:28:27.580]  You mean protesters with bazookas and rocket launchers, RPGs and aircraft and tanks?
[00:28:28.752 --> 00:28:37.200]  You mean those guys that were lining people up on the highway if they weren't part of the Al-Qaeda, Wahhabi groups, and shooting them?
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.202]  And on video, hacking families up with machetes?
[00:28:40.202 --> 00:28:42.244]  You mean those guys?
[00:28:42.244 --> 00:28:49.431]  This was already going on in the east of Libya while Joe Lee was running around praising these people, saying it was wonderful.
[00:28:49.431 --> 00:28:54.896]  Again, the West goes in, funds a uprising, calls it peaceful, and then bombs the country.
[00:28:56.755 --> 00:29:12.873]  Now, I've got to say, humanitarian intervention in Sudan is a lot more reasonable than it would be in Libya or Uganda, where Uganda, our government in the West, is backing the dictator who's killed millions of people in 26 years, on record.
[00:29:12.873 --> 00:29:17.138]  There, it's purely naked aggression and excuse to grab oil and other minerals.
[00:29:18.413 --> 00:29:22.317]  In the case of Sudan, the Muslims are the aggressors.
[00:29:22.317 --> 00:29:24.279]  They are pushing the Christians back.
[00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:25.480]  There is genocide.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.843]  But you better believe that if the U.S.
[00:29:28.843 --> 00:29:32.806]  goes in there, it's for the resources and the people are going to end up even being worse off.
[00:29:33.507 --> 00:29:42.715]  In fact, from what I've seen in the past, the West will go in, take over, and then put in a new Muslim leader, like Odinga in Kenya, and they'll start killing Christians at a hundred times the rate.
[00:29:42.715 --> 00:29:43.736]  That's my point.
[00:29:43.736 --> 00:29:46.158]  You can't get good out of this new world order.
[00:29:46.158 --> 00:29:48.741]  They've always got an excuse for why they're doing something.
[00:29:48.741 --> 00:29:51.463]  But it never ends up... We're on the march.
[00:29:51.463 --> 00:29:54.005]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.005 --> 00:29:56.668]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:24.682 --> 00:33:32.645]  Alright, we've got a congressman scheduled to be popping in with us on some really important news coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:33:32.645 --> 00:33:41.709]  We have Sonia, a girl from Uganda, who's been countering the globalist pro-invasion propaganda and reaching millions and millions of people.
[00:33:41.709 --> 00:33:45.891]  She's going to be popping in, and Patrick Henningsen as well, in studio.
[00:33:47.782 --> 00:34:00.794]  Now, that said, I do want to go to your phone calls, and I'm not going to spend any more time, unless you bring it up in your calls, until we get into the third hour on this Kony 2012 thing.
[00:34:00.794 --> 00:34:11.865]  But again, that was just the cap in the back of the cartridge igniting the powder in the cartridge, pushing the projectile, the bullet, down the barrel.
[00:34:13.576 --> 00:34:19.358]  And before this projectile leaves the barrel, I just want people to understand exactly what's happening.
[00:34:19.358 --> 00:34:23.179]  This is target Africa for globalist invasion.
[00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:32.642]  And so many people over the years have, on the street, in an email, have commented to me, hey Alex, you know what?
[00:34:32.642 --> 00:34:35.323]  You like your standard of living?
[00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:38.984]  Well then you better be for all these invasions because that's what keeps your standard of living up.
[00:34:40.407 --> 00:34:44.818]  And I've made an economic study of that, and that's not really true.
[00:34:46.243 --> 00:34:57.489]  The United States became wealthy because of its inventiveness and because of its wealth and had over 10% growth rates for the first hundred plus years of its expansion.
[00:34:57.489 --> 00:35:03.091]  And some of that was exploitive, but the Indians, the natives, were killing each other.
[00:35:03.091 --> 00:35:06.133]  They would come and say, help me go knock out the other tribe.
[00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:06.993]  Humans are humans.
[00:35:06.993 --> 00:35:08.974]  They were acting the exact same way.
[00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:11.496]  It was just that the Europeans had more advanced technologies.
[00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:12.396]  I don't
[00:35:31.067 --> 00:35:33.788]  On paper, they would.
[00:35:33.788 --> 00:35:38.610]  So a lot of this has been romanticized, when in reality it was something else.
[00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:46.533]  My point is, we pay for the empire, and we lose a lot more supporting the empire than we actually gain from it.
[00:35:46.533 --> 00:35:51.275]  And that idea that we're getting ahead because of the New World Order.
[00:35:51.275 --> 00:35:58.458]  This entire New World Order system is going after our freedoms as well.
[00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:00.279]  The globalists see all humans the same.
[00:36:01.175 --> 00:36:09.357]  To be exploited, to be dumbed down, to be controlled, to be killed, if they can get away with it, if you don't have anything that offers something up to them.
[00:36:09.357 --> 00:36:15.899]  It's all about raw, pure power, and the globalists see that as the greatest attribute.
[00:36:15.899 --> 00:36:21.181]  That they are ruthless, and they see those of us that aren't as weak.
[00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:27.683]  All right, so let me go through a smattering of other important news that ties into this.
[00:36:27.683 --> 00:36:28.523]  Look at this report.
[00:36:29.935 --> 00:36:41.040]  Greece on the breadline, HIV and malaria make a comeback, and this is from the London Guardian.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:55.987]  The savage cuts to Greece's health services budget, well once you get socialist health care, all you got is the government, have led to sharp rise in HIV, AIDS and malaria in the beleaguered nation, said a leading aid organization yesterday.
[00:36:56.943 --> 00:37:08.393]  The incidence of AIDS among intravenous drug users in central Athens soared by 1,250% in the first 10 months of 2011, compared with the same period the previous year, according to the head.
[00:37:08.393 --> 00:37:10.955]  And it goes through the group.
[00:37:10.955 --> 00:37:19.603]  Also, they report that malaria is becoming epidemic in the South for the first time since the rule of the colonels, which ended the 1970s.
[00:37:21.351 --> 00:37:23.392]  And it just goes on.
[00:37:23.392 --> 00:37:30.357]  Folks, they are being forced to dump their children on the street and government orphanages are running out of food.
[00:37:30.357 --> 00:37:33.339]  There are power outages now.
[00:37:33.339 --> 00:37:36.621]  And you're like, wow, that's terrible.
[00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:39.563]  Well, the globalists want to have their society fall apart.
[00:37:40.123 --> 00:37:56.399]  Because then, confidence dries up, terrorism dries up, things will completely fall apart, and in the next five years or so, the globalists can go in and buy up everything for pennies on the dollar, and then they'll have certain economic zones that they turn back on, but only those zones.
[00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:59.763]  Everything else will be in squalor, in a high-security type system.
[00:38:01.493 --> 00:38:06.596]  And that's why you're going into the Checkpoint Society, because the elites want to be safe within their system.
[00:38:06.596 --> 00:38:09.457]  And they want to make you poor as a tool of control.
[00:38:09.457 --> 00:38:12.319]  But also, really corrupt elites have written about this.
[00:38:12.319 --> 00:38:17.101]  They enjoy, it's called feudalism, it's a system of poverty for control.
[00:38:17.101 --> 00:38:27.727]  Seeing you poor, that makes their caviar and mistresses and kids they rape and kill for fun, that makes it that much more enjoyable.
[00:38:28.527 --> 00:38:33.210]  You see, they don't like seeing people do well.
[00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:43.076]  You've all run into people out there that hate it when somebody's doing well, instead of like, oh, I'm glad you're doing well, or wow, you're really beautiful, I admire that, or you're really talented, I admire that.
[00:38:43.076 --> 00:38:45.838]  There are a lot of people out there who hate it.
[00:38:45.838 --> 00:38:48.660]  Well, that's the globalist.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:52.142]  The globalists at their core hate other people's success.
[00:38:52.142 --> 00:38:53.103]  They hate
[00:38:53.982 --> 00:38:54.382]  Beauty.
[00:38:54.382 --> 00:38:55.443]  They hate independence.
[00:38:55.443 --> 00:38:56.584]  They hate freedom.
[00:38:56.584 --> 00:39:00.747]  They want you to be so poor that you've got to grovel to them.
[00:39:00.747 --> 00:39:01.668]  And they write about this.
[00:39:01.668 --> 00:39:06.372]  Every year at Bilderberg we get from Tucker and others who have sources inside, and I have some sources that...
[00:39:07.523 --> 00:39:09.484]  Are in the second echelon of Bilderberg.
[00:39:09.484 --> 00:39:11.345]  I'll just leave it at that that I've developed.
[00:39:11.345 --> 00:39:14.447]  The first thing they say is look at those protesters out there.
[00:39:14.447 --> 00:39:20.950]  We've got to shut down the economy where they don't even have money to heat their house or have a car or be here.
[00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:29.154]  We're hiding out in the mountains of Switzerland and there's 800 protesters out there with members of the Swiss government demanding to be let in here.
[00:39:30.171 --> 00:39:31.432]  What is the problem?
[00:39:31.432 --> 00:39:35.177]  I want the economy shut down and I want it shut down now.
[00:39:35.177 --> 00:39:43.446]  And then they cut to debates and say, well, listen, your excellency, if we cut off the resources too quickly, they're going to riot against us and overthrow us.
[00:39:43.446 --> 00:39:45.728]  So we've got to do it slowly.
[00:39:45.728 --> 00:39:49.353]  And then later, I'll be told something by Tucker or my other sources.
[00:39:51.132 --> 00:39:59.698]  And like two years later I'll see him at Davos say this thing on the stage that I was told word for word by name who said what two years before.
[00:39:59.698 --> 00:40:05.182]  So a lot of times they'll... I mean, Tucker's like, they're gonna have the fall of the Berlin Wall in one year.
[00:40:05.182 --> 00:40:07.583]  They've decided with the Soviets to do it.
[00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:13.908]  It's to make everybody think communism's dead, but in a way it's true because they can't hold their system together.
[00:40:13.908 --> 00:40:15.469]  So it was both.
[00:40:15.469 --> 00:40:15.909]  Boom.
[00:40:15.909 --> 00:40:16.729]  Everybody laughed at him.
[00:40:16.729 --> 00:40:18.210]  Happened.
[00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:20.072]  He's like, they'll be firing Margaret Thatcher.
[00:40:21.496 --> 00:40:26.400]  It's scary when you can't do a gruff old man voice, and you do it, and you find out it's your own voice.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.223]  But he's like, Margaret Thatcher will be out within six months.
[00:40:31.223 --> 00:40:32.124]  They're done with her.
[00:40:32.124 --> 00:40:33.245]  Everybody's like, oh yeah, right.
[00:40:33.245 --> 00:40:34.866]  Boom, she's gone.
[00:40:34.866 --> 00:40:38.709]  George Bush will, within the next two months, endorse carbon taxes.
[00:40:38.709 --> 00:40:39.850]  He'd been totally against it.
[00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.071]  Boom, it happened.
[00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:48.656]  I mean, just gas prices will go from $45 a barrel to about $150 in the next year.
[00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:49.897]  Everybody's like, that's ridiculous.
[00:40:49.897 --> 00:40:50.618]  Boom, happened.
[00:40:51.642 --> 00:40:53.423]  Then, Bilderberg's now concerned.
[00:40:53.423 --> 00:40:55.243]  2008, he said on my show.
[00:40:55.243 --> 00:40:57.544]  I was up at Bilderberg covering it in Virginia.
[00:40:57.544 --> 00:41:06.047]  He's like, well, my source told me that they're a little worried, people on the edge of revolt, so they will now lower it to below 60.
[00:41:06.047 --> 00:41:06.887]  Boom, starts.
[00:41:06.887 --> 00:41:12.129]  I mean, it's just like, these people really are running things.
[00:41:12.129 --> 00:41:15.230]  That's the incredible proof of it.
[00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.931]  They're steering it to a great degree.
[00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:20.692]  They want global government so that they can fully control society.
[00:41:21.604 --> 00:41:24.406]  And if you have no privacy, you have no freedom.
[00:41:24.406 --> 00:41:31.770]  If they have total transparency into your life, and know what you're doing, they can predict what you're going to do next and totally control you.
[00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:45.299]  So government and the elites are all secret, that's the New World Order, and exempt from their own laws they pass, that are unconstitutional and tyrannical, and then you live under total transparency with no privacy, and there's all these laws piled on you.
[00:41:45.299 --> 00:41:46.680]  That's the essence of slavery.
[00:41:48.123 --> 00:41:53.186]  And we're sold that it's liberty, we're sold that it's freedom, we're sold that it's this great thing.
[00:41:53.186 --> 00:41:56.427]  And it's not.
[00:41:56.427 --> 00:41:58.728]  So that's what I'm trying to get at here.
[00:41:58.728 --> 00:42:02.831]  And we told you austerity was coming three and a half years ago in the Obama deception.
[00:42:02.831 --> 00:42:11.635]  I told you 12 years ago that they would use the derivatives as a weapon to infect all the treasuries and all the other investments.
[00:42:11.635 --> 00:42:12.816]  They would hold people hostage.
[00:42:14.147 --> 00:42:14.347]  I think?
[00:42:34.943 --> 00:42:39.025]  First it's gradual, then it's kind of steps downward, and then they do plan some plunging.
[00:42:39.025 --> 00:42:39.825]  But not yet.
[00:42:39.825 --> 00:42:44.187]  They've got to get everything in order first, because a big plunge too early would actually expose them.
[00:42:44.187 --> 00:43:03.156]  I mean, think about how ridiculous it is that the very six megabanks that have engineered the fraud and put their politicians in, then sign Greece and Ireland and Iceland and United States and Europe, Germany, France, England, on to their debt.
[00:43:03.576 --> 00:43:20.461]  Well, yes, 92% in Iceland and 91% in Greece and 89% in this country or that is derivatives that the country signed on to, to the very bankers who are now announcing themselves the bosses and putting their presidents and prime ministers in.
[00:43:20.461 --> 00:43:22.102]  That's not very sophisticated.
[00:43:22.102 --> 00:43:23.522]  That's pretty clear.
[00:43:23.522 --> 00:43:27.163]  It's being conquered by financial fraud.
[00:43:27.163 --> 00:43:32.345]  And they cut the police, they cut the fire, they cut the teachers, they cut the health care, they cut everything.
[00:43:33.345 --> 00:43:42.892]  And tell you, well, you deserve this because you were on welfare when they made you go under socialist health care in Greece and other places.
[00:43:42.892 --> 00:43:45.794]  Paul Watson's over in England.
[00:43:45.794 --> 00:43:51.398]  He has had a chest cold for a month.
[00:43:51.398 --> 00:43:56.122]  And I would call him, he'd go, no, I'm still really sick, Alex, it's terrible.
[00:43:56.122 --> 00:44:00.325]  And he goes, I'm still fighting to get in to see the government doctor.
[00:44:00.325 --> 00:44:01.966]  And I said, but I read England's got
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.941]  Private doctors.
[00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:06.341]  And of course, I knew the answer.
[00:44:06.341 --> 00:44:07.162]  I don't know why I said that.
[00:44:07.162 --> 00:44:16.865]  And he goes, yes, Alex, but you've got to go to the government first, and then they've got to allow you and they refer you to a private practitioner.
[00:44:16.865 --> 00:44:19.866]  And he was starting to really get concerned.
[00:44:19.866 --> 00:44:25.428]  He was, you know, laying out in the sun in the cold weather trying to get, you know, vitamin A and stuff.
[00:44:25.428 --> 00:44:26.909]  He was taking all vitamins, minerals.
[00:44:28.385 --> 00:44:28.885]  All this stuff.
[00:44:28.885 --> 00:44:31.427]  There's been some really bad chest colds going around the world, as you know.
[00:44:31.427 --> 00:44:36.590]  There's all these drug-resistant bacteria and mutated viruses because of antibiotics and things.
[00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:40.452]  And he finally got in to see the government health care people.
[00:44:40.452 --> 00:44:44.854]  And I've watched the House of Lords debates many times.
[00:44:44.854 --> 00:44:46.535]  It's quite a spectacle.
[00:44:46.535 --> 00:44:48.917]  And I mean, I remember Tony Blair in there over and over again.
[00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:49.117]  They'd go,
[00:44:50.625 --> 00:44:59.209]  Prime Minister, is it not true that people on average are waiting 18 months for brain surgeries that are close to 100% operable?
[00:44:59.209 --> 00:45:01.510]  That means they can fix it.
[00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:07.352]  If you have the surgery within three months, but almost completely fatal after one year.
[00:45:07.352 --> 00:45:10.314]  And he stands up, yes it's true, we're working on that.
[00:45:10.314 --> 00:45:12.455]  I mean, this is what we want here.
[00:45:12.455 --> 00:45:12.895]  And big
[00:45:14.051 --> 00:45:24.260]  Bank-owned, insurance company-owned health care providers wrote the health care bill and then acted like, you know, the greedy HMOs didn't want it when they wrote it.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:33.369]  And now they've changed their Supreme Court pleadings so that Anthony Scalia, they're saying, that's in the news today, may vote and say the government can make you buy a product.
[00:45:34.545 --> 00:45:38.567]  As if we need any debate about whether that's constitutional or not.
[00:45:38.567 --> 00:45:40.868]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:45:40.868 --> 00:45:42.169]  And it's part of this nanny state.
[00:45:42.169 --> 00:45:44.150]  Well, we make you get car insurance.
[00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.911]  You didn't used to.
[00:45:44.911 --> 00:45:47.332]  You used to run somebody over.
[00:45:47.332 --> 00:45:49.593]  You got arrested for reckless driving.
[00:45:49.593 --> 00:45:50.974]  Or they'd come take your house.
[00:45:50.974 --> 00:45:56.097]  Or they'd throw you in jail.
[00:45:56.097 --> 00:45:56.737]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:45:56.737 --> 00:45:58.118]  National Health Service.
[00:45:58.118 --> 00:46:00.799]  Waiting time increases may cost lives, doctors warn.
[00:46:02.924 --> 00:46:05.668]  May cost lives, it's already costing lives.
[00:46:05.668 --> 00:46:07.931]  That too out of London Guardian.
[00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.833]  That's the trap of socialist healthcare.
[00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:14.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, everyone's always been able to get healthcare in this country.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.443]  I mean, I've had an injury before, gone to the hospital on the weekend.
[00:46:19.648 --> 00:46:23.930]  I've got insurance, I've got money in my wallet, I've got credit cards.
[00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:34.355]  I sat at the back of the line with a finger dangling by a piece of skin as the illegal aliens on record were just waved in, not even to debate, they get instant coverage.
[00:46:34.355 --> 00:46:42.218]  I had a crew member who had a big surgery he had to have because of a pre-existing condition, he couldn't get it, he'd been thrown off insurance.
[00:46:42.218 --> 00:46:42.879]  I said, don't worry.
[00:46:43.936 --> 00:46:46.458]  They're supposed to give you 30% charity care.
[00:46:46.458 --> 00:46:47.679]  They don't want to tell you about this.
[00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:49.680]  Only the illegals are taught how to access it.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.902]  He went and got the whole thing paid for.
[00:46:51.902 --> 00:46:53.063]  Like a $40,000 surgery.
[00:46:53.063 --> 00:46:54.344]  He couldn't believe it.
[00:46:54.344 --> 00:47:00.968]  I'm like, listen, medicine is supposed to be taking care of people.
[00:47:00.968 --> 00:47:10.695]  Again, but now under the healthcare rules, under Obama, they're allowing hospitals to get rid of those mandates that have always just been there as part of your Hippocratic Oath.
[00:47:10.695 --> 00:47:11.036]  So see,
[00:47:12.128 --> 00:47:19.733]  No one gets turned away from health care unless you're ignorant and they don't teach American citizens how to access all of this.
[00:47:19.733 --> 00:47:21.594]  So now all of that's going to be gone.
[00:47:21.594 --> 00:47:22.615]  Look at Greece.
[00:47:22.615 --> 00:47:33.562]  Once they get you, once they get you addicted to this, once they get you
[00:47:36.377 --> 00:47:40.201]  To where you don't have any other choice than to say, yeah, you get your health care if you've had all your vaccines.
[00:47:40.201 --> 00:47:42.803]  Yeah, you get your health care if you take this anti-racism drug.
[00:47:42.803 --> 00:47:46.706]  They're not making you do that, they're saying.
[00:47:46.706 --> 00:47:48.308]  They're pushing to make people do that.
[00:47:48.308 --> 00:47:54.714]  I mean, it's a total nightmare nanny state controlling every facet of your life.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.801]  And they always sell their tyranny.
[00:48:00.801 --> 00:48:02.141]  Taking private property.
[00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:03.462]  Taking your guns.
[00:48:03.462 --> 00:48:04.822]  Banning sports.
[00:48:04.822 --> 00:48:06.063]  Banning tag.
[00:48:06.063 --> 00:48:08.444]  Banning drawing a gun in art class.
[00:48:08.444 --> 00:48:11.745]  In the name of keeping your body safe, invading Africa.
[00:48:11.745 --> 00:48:12.605]  We gotta keep somebody safe.
[00:48:12.605 --> 00:48:14.546]  We gotta bomb Libya, because we love them.
[00:48:15.523 --> 00:48:19.286]  They always sell it with, we come in peace, we're friends.
[00:48:19.286 --> 00:48:21.248]  It's total camouflage.
[00:48:21.248 --> 00:48:22.589]  It's a total front.
[00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:25.771]  George Clooney is a loving liberal who's just an idiot and means well.
[00:48:25.771 --> 00:48:26.732]  Total front.
[00:48:26.732 --> 00:48:29.414]  It's a raving, dangerous criminal.
[00:48:29.414 --> 00:48:30.755]  Angelina Jolie.
[00:48:30.755 --> 00:48:32.897]  All of them.
[00:48:32.897 --> 00:48:36.800]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.583]  And it's time to stop being naive and realize these aren't idiots.
[00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:42.018]  They're in charge.
[00:48:42.018 --> 00:48:50.360]  They've been given power because they play ball with the new world order.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.900]  It's that simple.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.121]  And so it's going to take doing real research, folks, to be informed.
[00:48:57.121 --> 00:49:00.301]  I mean, look at this.
[00:49:00.301 --> 00:49:04.302]  There's a big article saying Bernanke's been caught lying about inflation in the U.S.
[00:49:04.302 --> 00:49:06.342]  in Bloomberg.
[00:49:06.342 --> 00:49:08.363]  Well, no one buys that inflation's low.
[00:49:08.363 --> 00:49:09.683]  Everybody knows inflation's up.
[00:49:10.586 --> 00:49:18.712]  Even though they've depressed the economy, still there's inflation.
[00:49:18.712 --> 00:49:20.374]  An inflationary depression.
[00:49:20.374 --> 00:49:26.498]  That's supposed to be impossible in the economic Keynesian system, but it's not because we live in a rigged economy.
[00:49:26.498 --> 00:49:30.902]  It's the double super-whammy.
[00:49:30.902 --> 00:49:34.905]  Here's another one.
[00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:37.126]  Obama shifts healthcare defense.
[00:49:37.126 --> 00:49:39.989]  Again, I mentioned that article to you.
[00:49:41.175 --> 00:49:46.359]  But I have another article here dealing with David Cameron.
[00:49:46.359 --> 00:49:52.304]  And I'm going to cover that after I get to some calls when we come back in the next segment because I want to get to your calls.
[00:49:52.304 --> 00:49:57.569]  Starstruck David Cameron's embarrassing fawning over Barack Obama and his beautiful words.
[00:49:57.569 --> 00:49:59.370]  That's a quote, Daily Mail.
[00:49:59.370 --> 00:49:59.911]  Here's another one.
[00:49:59.911 --> 00:50:01.712]  Cameron meets New York financiers.
[00:50:01.712 --> 00:50:02.433]  Financial Times in London.
[00:50:03.697 --> 00:50:12.461]  When David Cameron, the supposed conservative, came over here, he's about like a Mitt Romney, he wouldn't even meet with the Republican leadership.
[00:50:12.461 --> 00:50:14.642]  He wouldn't even meet with the Republican Congress.
[00:50:14.642 --> 00:50:17.723]  And he bad-mouthed them in speeches with Obama.
[00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:20.665]  But guess where he really spent his time while he was here?
[00:50:20.665 --> 00:50:23.246]  Financial Times reports.
[00:50:23.246 --> 00:50:28.228]  Fawning over the head of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein.
[00:50:28.228 --> 00:50:31.870]  Well, yeah, he came to see the big bosses.
[00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:37.274]  And who is Lloyd Blankfein?
[00:50:37.274 --> 00:50:47.101]  These are people who openly, their own executives have quit and said, sit around and call their customers scum and idiots and suckers.
[00:50:47.101 --> 00:50:49.442]  Because it's a culture of destruction.
[00:50:49.442 --> 00:50:54.746]  These are the parasites we bail out, who then loan us our own money back to us.
[00:50:54.746 --> 00:50:57.448]  And Cameron's here, fawning at their feet.
[00:50:57.448 --> 00:51:02.051]  We'll be back with your calls.
[00:51:02.051 --> 00:51:03.372]  Don't answer it!

[00:51:19.833 --> 00:51:24.096]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[00:53:55.486 --> 00:53:57.489]  Civilian Emergency Dispatch System.
[00:53:57.489 --> 00:53:58.631]  Peace through preparedness.
[00:54:12.962 --> 00:54:27.466]  You know, the kind of news I want to cover is stuff like a gentleman who in the 1970s went up reportedly 30 plus miles in a balloon of some type and they say really holds the record for skydiving.
[00:54:27.466 --> 00:54:29.006]  I'd like to try to get that guy on.
[00:54:29.006 --> 00:54:30.167]  I mean, that is really neat.
[00:54:30.167 --> 00:54:31.767]  That's the kind of news I'm really into.
[00:54:31.767 --> 00:54:38.189]  But we've got to deal with these globalists who are trying to destroy our planet.
[00:54:38.189 --> 00:54:38.849]  They're not trying.
[00:54:38.849 --> 00:54:41.550]  They're sure doing a good job without trying.
[00:54:42.702 --> 00:54:50.045]  Instead of, you know, focusing on all this negative stuff, I would rather focus on interesting things.
[00:54:50.045 --> 00:54:54.988]  Like, record-seeking skydiver makes 13-mile test jump.
[00:54:54.988 --> 00:55:01.290]  Skydiving daredevil, Felix... How do you pronounce that?
[00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:06.813]  Baumgartner, is more than halfway towards his goal of setting a world record for the highest jump.
[00:55:08.192 --> 00:55:10.174]  And it says that he jumped from 71,581 feet.
[00:55:10.174 --> 00:55:12.276]  Looks like he's in space, but he's not.
[00:55:12.276 --> 00:55:13.557]  He's in a spacesuit.
[00:55:13.557 --> 00:55:16.379]  They're saying the record is 19.5 miles, but they're arguing that...
[00:55:22.503 --> 00:55:26.844]  Others may have actually done it from higher, just not properly documented it.
[00:55:26.844 --> 00:55:28.844]  Talk about adventurous.
[00:55:28.844 --> 00:55:33.305]  Then you got the woman who reportedly committed suicide with a chainsaw.
[00:55:33.305 --> 00:55:34.745]  Maybe that's like an Arkansas.
[00:55:34.745 --> 00:55:38.606]  Maybe somebody did it and they made her leave a note before they did it.
[00:55:38.606 --> 00:55:39.066]  Who knows?
[00:55:39.066 --> 00:55:41.986]  I mean, there's just so much crazy stuff going on.
[00:55:41.986 --> 00:55:47.367]  Right now, let's start going to your phone calls for the next 30, 40 minutes before a congressman joins us.
[00:55:47.367 --> 00:55:49.728]  Brandon in Canada, you're on the air.
[00:55:49.728 --> 00:55:50.708]  Welcome.
[00:55:50.708 --> 00:55:51.428]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:55.953]  Um, yeah, going back to this Kony 2012 thing, I just had an idea.
[00:55:55.953 --> 00:56:04.798]  What if someone made a film in the same style, but, like, have it like Bush-Cheney 2012 or something like that?
[00:56:04.798 --> 00:56:06.259]  You know, I actually thought of that.
[00:56:06.259 --> 00:56:10.381]  I actually thought of that, and that would really get people's attention.
[00:56:10.381 --> 00:56:11.201]  Bush-Cheney 2012.
[00:56:12.987 --> 00:56:17.010]  And then it would connect people's mind to, hey, here's the real war crimes.
[00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:18.711]  Here's what they did.
[00:56:18.711 --> 00:56:25.857]  Or Clinton 2012, because the Clintons did a bunch of mass murder in the 90s as well.
[00:56:25.857 --> 00:56:27.298]  Absolutely.
[00:56:27.298 --> 00:56:28.779]  Yeah, no, that's a great idea.
[00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:32.322]  And you know, you could have like a little boy looking at pictures of Bush and Cheney and things.
[00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:33.143]  This is a bad man.
[00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:37.253]  Well, I've said that's what propaganda has come down to now.
[00:56:37.253 --> 00:56:39.515]  It's just like, there's the bad man, get him!
[00:56:39.515 --> 00:56:50.086]  But again, I wouldn't have just focused on this charity the last week off and on if it was just about the charity, you know, being a scam from my research and in my view.
[00:56:51.167 --> 00:57:04.236]  I've been focused on this because it is the opening salvo for a bunch of PR from the UN calling for invasions humanitarily, George Clooney getting arrested, Angelina Jolie at the UN pushing for it.
[00:57:04.236 --> 00:57:09.679]  I mean, I told folks, watch, this is gonna launch a big PR drive and it's just begun.
[00:57:09.679 --> 00:57:11.721]  I mean, it's everywhere now.
[00:57:11.721 --> 00:57:12.941]  Send troops to Africa!
[00:57:12.941 --> 00:57:13.722]  We demand it!
[00:57:14.875 --> 00:57:20.078]  Look, another thing, too, Alex, is I was thinking about you being the tip of the spear and your network.
[00:57:20.078 --> 00:57:24.401]  I mean, like, you know guys like George Noorie, Jesse Ventura, all these guys.
[00:57:24.401 --> 00:57:35.548]  I mean, what if you created a forum where all you men and women got together, where you couldn't be, like, not listened to, you know, undeniably a voice?
[00:57:37.025 --> 00:57:55.851]  Well, you know, people like George Norrie and Jesse Ventura and Ron Paul and others, they're all real independent and they understand that a lot of times when people just try to get organized, have like a conference or something, everybody feels really important and there's resolutions passed and then people say, okay, we're going to move forward in this way.
[00:57:57.236 --> 00:57:58.797]  And nothing really comes out of it.
[00:57:58.797 --> 00:58:05.323]  What's better is just for all of us to attack in different directions, but in the same directions as well against tyranny.
[00:58:05.323 --> 00:58:08.786]  And the general fight is happening and ongoing right now.
[00:58:08.786 --> 00:58:16.071]  I mean, notice how the globalists now are going out and launching PR to attack things, but making it look like it's coming from the grassroots, see?
[00:58:16.792 --> 00:58:18.694]  The system's already lost credibility.
[00:58:18.694 --> 00:58:22.998]  So they're going to now try to pose as, oh, the grassroots wants war.
[00:58:22.998 --> 00:58:24.460]  Oh, the peace groups want it.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.621]  George Clooney wants it.
[00:58:25.621 --> 00:58:30.646]  Well, then, that's... But the White House documents are there with Samantha Powers and others.
[00:58:30.646 --> 00:58:36.031]  Chang, three years ago, this would be their model to launch all the new wars.
[00:58:36.031 --> 00:58:37.012]  That's what they've done.
[00:58:37.012 --> 00:58:38.773]  Have the left call for it.
[00:58:43.482 --> 00:58:47.453]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.928 --> 00:58:58.150]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:15.736]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:59:16.016 --> 00:59:22.202]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[00:59:22.202 --> 00:59:30.371]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:59:30.371 --> 00:59:33.454]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[00:59:33.874 --> 00:59:36.655]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:59:36.655 --> 00:59:37.936]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:59:37.936 --> 00:59:38.816]  It's incredible.
[00:59:38.816 --> 00:59:48.020]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:53.903]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:59:53.903 --> 00:59:56.284]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.284 --> 00:59:59.045]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.402]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.402 --> 01:00:12.002]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.002 --> 01:00:13.543]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:17.724]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.724 --> 01:00:21.825]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.312 --> 01:00:52.311]  We are now into our number two and coming up reportedly in about 35 minutes or so we're gonna have a congressman pop in with some breaking news for us then we're going to have
[01:00:53.399 --> 01:01:04.302]  A Ugandan woman on whose one video has been watched more than three million times exposing that Kony 2012 and this whole call for an invasion over there is not what the population has been wanting.
[01:01:04.302 --> 01:01:17.565]  There have been riots and stonings and people doing all sorts of stuff over there when they see the film because it's just complete bull watching trendies hop around and act like they're saviors calling for invasion forces.
[01:01:17.565 --> 01:01:18.565]  So that's all coming up.
[01:01:20.214 --> 01:01:26.598]  Also, we've got a lot of economic news on the inflation front, and on the government healthcare front, and the Iran front.
[01:01:26.598 --> 01:01:29.120]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.682]  Bryce in Missouri, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:34.818]  Thanks Alex for taking my call.
[01:01:34.818 --> 01:01:42.583]  I really appreciate what you folks are doing and we're all in this war together and stuff like that.
[01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:46.485]  Although I can get discouraged because I put out a movie about a month ago.
[01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:50.967]  I won't name names because I respect your show and everything like that.
[01:01:50.967 --> 01:01:58.471]  But No Traction got on it and then you got this globalist funded movie that comes out and millions and millions of people see it.
[01:01:58.471 --> 01:02:01.053]  And I just pray and ask God
[01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:03.470]  What's going on here?
[01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.632]  What's wrong with this pitcher?
[01:02:05.632 --> 01:02:07.453]  What's your take on that?
[01:02:07.453 --> 01:02:11.175]  I mean, specifically, what's wrong with what pitcher?
[01:02:11.175 --> 01:02:16.219]  Well, the same idea is we're all in this together fighting the info war.
[01:02:16.219 --> 01:02:24.945]  So you put out a movie on YouTube and you don't get as much traction as, let's say, you know, Kony2012 or whatever.
[01:02:24.945 --> 01:02:28.287]  I mean, what can we do to kind of just up the ante, up the
[01:02:29.952 --> 01:02:32.194]  I guess the hits on the video or something.
[01:02:32.194 --> 01:02:34.756]  How can I get my message across?
[01:02:34.756 --> 01:02:35.957]  All right.
[01:02:35.957 --> 01:02:40.921]  Look, I appreciate your call.
[01:02:40.921 --> 01:02:44.364]  Let's just take YouTube alone as one venue we reach people through.
[01:02:44.364 --> 01:02:55.334]  Conservatively, conservatively now, because I've gone back and actually added it up, in the last three years or so, we've had about 500 million views conservatively
[01:02:56.292 --> 01:02:58.494]  One way or another on YouTube.
[01:02:58.494 --> 01:03:02.056]  500 million.
[01:03:02.056 --> 01:03:22.509]  Something like Kony that has big foundations behind it, and George W. Bush, and Bill Gates, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, and the National Security Council, and the White House, and the Carter Center, and the Open Society Foundation, and the International Coalition for Responsibility to protect all these groups.
[01:03:22.509 --> 01:03:24.791]  They launch something and push it.
[01:03:26.243 --> 01:03:35.489]  for a year and then release it and then have thousands of newspapers and hundreds of TV systems under their control promote it.
[01:03:35.489 --> 01:03:42.394]  And all it gets is, I don't know, all versions together, maybe over a hundred million views.
[01:03:42.394 --> 01:03:49.519]  And then there are tens of thousands of videos with hundreds of thousands, hundreds of videos with over a million views.
[01:03:49.519 --> 01:03:55.303]  If you put all my county videos I did together, probably three million views last week.
[01:03:57.870 --> 01:04:08.620]  But then I saw hundreds and hundreds of other people put out videos and then people from Uganda come out and respond to my videos and their videos got hundreds of thousands and millions and you name it.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:13.184]  And so you add it together, we, they had to shut down comments on the video.
[01:04:13.184 --> 01:04:14.305]  They had to back off.
[01:04:14.305 --> 01:04:16.247]  They're having to respond now.
[01:04:16.247 --> 01:04:21.632]  And then mainstream media even picked it up and said, yeah, this is a, this is a distortion.
[01:04:21.632 --> 01:04:23.854]  So I think we absolutely kicked their butt.
[01:04:24.963 --> 01:04:30.567]  I mean, they had to fake a grassroots campaign just to get the viral spread they did get.
[01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:34.590]  And so, I don't know how people always take everything as a loss when it's a win.
[01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:37.272]  I mean, we've had a big win on this.
[01:04:38.703 --> 01:04:43.548]  And now they got Clooney getting arrested, now they got Angelina Jolie at the court doing stunts.
[01:04:43.548 --> 01:04:49.394]  They're doing their big rollout for new wars, calling it liberal, war is peace, and we're countering it.
[01:04:49.394 --> 01:04:55.320]  And, you know, it took six months for Obama to go negative in the polls when he had a 90% approval rating or higher.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.803]  I mean, these guys are wearing out quick now.
[01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:02.216]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.216 --> 01:05:07.798]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:07.798 --> 01:05:12.820]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:17.862]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:23.626]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:23.626 --> 01:05:25.947]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:05:25.947 --> 01:05:30.751]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:30.751 --> 01:05:31.851]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:31.851 --> 01:05:34.914]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:05:34.914 --> 01:05:38.216]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:38.536 --> 01:05:41.718]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:41.718 --> 01:05:43.939]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:44.899]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:45.139]  That's 877-327-0365.

[01:08:05.799 --> 01:08:10.625]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.625 --> 01:08:12.227]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.227 --> 01:08:13.769]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.769 --> 01:08:17.974]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.974 --> 01:08:22.019]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.162 --> 01:08:42.747]  As you know, there has been a near total blackout in the last week and a half on the fact that impeachment proceedings have begun in the House and Senate via the treason of Obama announcing our military is under U.N.
[01:08:42.747 --> 01:08:43.828]  command.
[01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:49.430]  And now, of course, the Marines aren't allowed to have their guns around the Secretary of Defense because they can't be trusted.
[01:08:50.782 --> 01:08:55.724]  This is the bizarro world we live in under the New World Order.
[01:08:55.724 --> 01:09:03.427]  Now, coming up, we have a congressman, a surprise visit popping in to speak about some very important news.
[01:09:03.427 --> 01:09:07.289]  And we have some other guests as well, but right now, I am going to your phone calls.
[01:09:07.289 --> 01:09:15.552]  I first want to mention this little article by Paul Joseph Watson, and this story has been picked up
[01:09:16.721 --> 01:09:17.602]  By the Drudge Report.
[01:09:39.625 --> 01:09:42.926]  By the Wall Street Journal, Market Watch, and some other outfits.
[01:09:42.926 --> 01:09:47.928]  And they've confirmed that Matt Drudge and Alex Jones are in government documents.
[01:09:47.928 --> 01:10:04.755]  They've admitted that the Total Sexual Assault group, the TSA, or the Toilet Safety Administration, as South Park calls them, but I like Total Sexual Assault, that's what it is, has our names and websites in the database.
[01:10:04.755 --> 01:10:08.157]  When they did that national stand down of the scanners on National Opt Out Day.
[01:10:08.973 --> 01:10:10.534]  You know, to say no to the scanners.
[01:10:10.534 --> 01:10:13.216]  And so for a year and a half, they've been trying to get those documents.
[01:10:13.216 --> 01:10:19.661]  The government has admitted that, indeed, those names are involved in secret communiques.
[01:10:19.661 --> 01:10:22.042]  Matt Drudge, Alex Jones, you name it.
[01:10:22.042 --> 01:10:24.464]  But they will not release the nine pages.
[01:10:24.464 --> 01:10:26.666]  They released some of it, but it's redacted.
[01:10:26.666 --> 01:10:29.828]  So Bob Barr has filed suit on them.
[01:10:29.828 --> 01:10:32.370]  I want to find out what they're saying about me.
[01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:36.734]  I mean, I'm really honored to be on the White House enemies list.
[01:10:36.734 --> 01:10:40.701]  And I'm really honored to be on a TSA enemies list, but I want to know what they're saying about me.
[01:10:41.465 --> 01:10:49.050]  I mean, I love it that I'm in the WikiLeaks with Stratfor attacking me, calling me crazy, because I didn't believe that whole Bin Laden fairy tale.
[01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:51.812]  But then they go on to say they don't believe he was thrown in the ocean.
[01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:52.172]  Well, what?
[01:10:52.172 --> 01:10:54.974]  You're supposed to just believe whatever Obama tells you?
[01:10:54.974 --> 01:10:56.715]  I thought I'm a crazy man!
[01:10:56.715 --> 01:11:00.717]  I mean, I like it when I know we're getting under their skin.
[01:11:00.717 --> 01:11:07.682]  Last year when I exposed, because it was in their own documents, they want to shut down power plants to double profits for GE and others, because they're allowed to stay open.
[01:11:08.934 --> 01:11:14.684]  I was excited when the White House spokesman Jay Carney came out and said we were crazy.
[01:11:14.684 --> 01:11:19.312]  I mean, that is exciting, to really know you're having an effect.
[01:11:20.848 --> 01:11:28.873]  You know why folks always say, please, just give me your John Hancock, you know, when you're at the bank taking out a loan or they want you to sign a credit card receipt or at a hotel.
[01:11:28.873 --> 01:11:30.274]  Give me your John Hancock, please.
[01:11:30.274 --> 01:11:32.255]  That was kind of an old saying back when folks knew U.S.
[01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:32.995]  history.
[01:11:32.995 --> 01:11:33.656]  John Hancock.
[01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:40.300]  Everybody signing that Declaration of Independence was signing a warrant that they would be arrested, killed, attacked if they didn't win.
[01:11:41.604 --> 01:11:41.964]  I don't know.
[01:12:12.014 --> 01:12:16.255]  No, it's so important, I want to make this point again.
[01:12:16.255 --> 01:12:19.156]  We're not fighting tyranny because we're heroes.
[01:12:19.156 --> 01:12:22.477]  We're fighting it because I don't want to be a slave.
[01:12:22.477 --> 01:12:23.537]  It's selfishness.
[01:12:23.537 --> 01:12:27.178]  I want to explain that to people.
[01:12:27.178 --> 01:12:29.378]  Selfishness.
[01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:31.939]  I want my children to be free.
[01:12:31.939 --> 01:12:33.619]  I want you to be free.
[01:12:33.619 --> 01:12:36.140]  I don't like scum getting it over on me.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.840]  You ever had your house robbed?
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.621]  Growing up in Dallas, we got robbed, I don't know, five, six times.
[01:12:42.697 --> 01:12:48.118]  It's not just that they get grandpa's gun, or it's not just that they steal the electricity glow ball.
[01:12:48.118 --> 01:12:49.638]  Remember those in the 80s?
[01:12:49.638 --> 01:12:52.899]  It's not just they steal, you know, my dad's favorite turntable.
[01:12:52.899 --> 01:12:56.560]  It's that somebody broke in your house.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.561]  You know, the biggest insult is to go into the refrigerator and they drink your beer.
[01:13:01.561 --> 01:13:03.681]  Or your Coca-Cola, you know.
[01:13:03.681 --> 01:13:04.522]  Like, look at this!
[01:13:04.522 --> 01:13:07.222]  They even took the beer!
[01:13:07.222 --> 01:13:08.522]  Uncool!
[01:13:08.522 --> 01:13:11.403]  You know, it's the violation!
[01:13:12.947 --> 01:13:14.649]  People are like, yeah, you know, toughen up.
[01:13:14.649 --> 01:13:20.777]  Let the TSA grab your genitals.
[01:13:20.777 --> 01:13:21.879]  Yo, yo, get tough.
[01:13:21.879 --> 01:13:22.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.383]  All right, well, how about I just go in the parking lot, the TSA person.
[01:13:25.383 --> 01:13:25.964]  Get tough.
[01:13:25.964 --> 01:13:26.625]  I'm going to grab yours.
[01:13:27.719 --> 01:13:29.200]  It's a violation!
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:34.363]  There's a reason anybody else grabs your genitals in a park, they can get five years in prison for it!
[01:13:34.363 --> 01:13:35.984]  Man, that's a big no-no!
[01:13:35.984 --> 01:13:40.527]  It's not get tough, it's like, more like get out of my face, pervs!
[01:13:40.527 --> 01:13:45.530]  Stop trying to teach me and my children that weirdos are gonna grab their rear end!
[01:13:46.681 --> 01:13:48.402]  I mean, folks, they don't just patch your rear end.
[01:13:48.402 --> 01:13:52.904]  You know, you see the police frisk, you know, if they find drugs or guns and they want to check.
[01:13:52.904 --> 01:13:56.365]  Okay, you know, they're actually, you know, checking for things.
[01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:59.706]  Not, well, let me really, let me see what those are.
[01:13:59.706 --> 01:14:00.367]  Come on!
[01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:01.647]  All right, I'm done ranting.
[01:14:01.647 --> 01:14:03.548]  I got to go to your calls.
[01:14:03.548 --> 01:14:05.529]  Shut up, Jones, and go to the calls.
[01:14:05.529 --> 01:14:07.709]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.270]  Welcome.
[01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.291]  Hi, Alex.
[01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:10.551]  Hey, buddy.
[01:14:10.551 --> 01:14:13.152]  You know, you talked about inflation a little bit.
[01:14:13.152 --> 01:14:15.553]  About a year ago, I was buying ground turkey for 99 cents a roll.
[01:14:17.555 --> 01:14:22.019]  And a few months ago it was up to $2.65, and the last time I looked it was like $3.19 now.
[01:14:22.019 --> 01:14:24.801]  Oh, and I love ground turkey, man.
[01:14:24.801 --> 01:14:27.543]  It makes the best sloppy joes out there, doesn't it?
[01:14:27.543 --> 01:14:33.727]  It does, but it's going up in price and so is everything else as far as the... You know, my wife pointed that out on Turkey Bacon.
[01:14:33.727 --> 01:14:36.590]  She said this is like three times what it was a year ago.
[01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:40.793]  Everything's going up, but no, there's no inflation, John, because the government said so.
[01:14:40.793 --> 01:14:42.194]  And don't be a conspiracy terrorist.
[01:14:43.905 --> 01:14:46.586]  Another thing, Alex, about the United Nations system.
[01:14:46.586 --> 01:14:51.668]  We're into it a lot of big ways, but we're into it in small ways, too.
[01:14:51.668 --> 01:15:02.111]  I'm looking at a box of firecrackers left over from New Year's, and it used to be, when I was a kid, it said Class C common fireworks, but now it says UN 1.4G.
[01:15:02.111 --> 01:15:05.072]  That's a United Nations designation on it.
[01:15:05.072 --> 01:15:09.914]  And when you buy small arms ammunition, if you buy it by the case that comes, it's got a UN designation on the side.
[01:15:10.788 --> 01:15:11.529]  They got the U.N.
[01:15:11.529 --> 01:15:14.510]  signs up in front of National Forest saying, hey, that we own the property now.
[01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.431]  You know what's funny?
[01:15:15.431 --> 01:15:16.832]  They even put up U.N.
[01:15:16.832 --> 01:15:21.535]  NGOs at the hike and bike trails, and I'm so conditioned now.
[01:15:21.535 --> 01:15:24.597]  I left my iPhone, you know, hidden in the trunk of my car.
[01:15:24.597 --> 01:15:29.080]  I was going on a hike, and I didn't even go back and get it because it was on down the path about a quarter mile.
[01:15:30.822 --> 01:15:40.567]  I've been conditioned to just accept it, and I did see a blurb where there's UN designations under the UNIDIR regulation on ammo.
[01:15:40.567 --> 01:15:52.913]  For now, about two years, they denominate postal service on international shipments according to SDRs, which is that global cashless currency.
[01:15:52.913 --> 01:15:56.694]  And you're right, we're already in this thing, and we're just taking it.
[01:15:58.365 --> 01:16:01.046]  I heard this six months ago and didn't believe it until I saw it.
[01:16:01.046 --> 01:16:09.869]  New ammo is being shipped out internationally, I guess if it's for the military, and they're micro-etching some of the bullets.
[01:16:09.869 --> 01:16:11.010]  And I didn't believe that.
[01:16:11.010 --> 01:16:13.330]  They're just doing whatever they want.
[01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:14.631]  They're doing whatever they want, John.
[01:16:16.526 --> 01:16:17.407]  Go to a toy store.
[01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:21.548]  Go to a toy store and look at toy army soldiers and see something that says U.S.
[01:16:21.548 --> 01:16:22.789]  Army Fighting Men or U.S.
[01:16:22.789 --> 01:16:23.950]  Army Soldiers.
[01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:24.470]  It's not there.
[01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:26.211]  It's all World Peacekeepers now.
[01:16:26.211 --> 01:16:27.931]  I have made that point for 10 years.
[01:16:27.931 --> 01:16:31.013]  In fact, will you run back to Tim Fruge because they cleaned out the warehouse?
[01:16:31.733 --> 01:16:38.780]  And there were all the props, things I'd bought over 15 years, have just continually gotten put into, you know, different offices.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:47.028]  And there was a big pile of toys I'd seen in stores where it was all UN soldier this, UN soldier that, global peace force.
[01:16:47.028 --> 01:16:47.588]  And I said, hey,
[01:16:48.989 --> 01:17:11.349]  Give me that a few weeks ago, and I'm not where they just ask him give me the UN toys Just just folks run get him to bring me the UN toys listen I've been in stores, and you can't find cuz I've got three children you cannot find tanks or Airplanes or army men that don't say you in and the cartoons are all the same, but the propaganda has gone on a long time
[01:17:11.869 --> 01:17:16.856]  I let my children watch the old cheesy 60's Godzilla movies when they're really good and do good at their homeschool.
[01:17:16.856 --> 01:17:21.502]  Like once a month, because it's guys in a gorilla suit or a dinosaur suit.
[01:17:21.502 --> 01:17:24.386]  Like last night we watched half of King Kong versus...
[01:17:25.782 --> 01:17:26.603]  Godzilla.
[01:17:26.603 --> 01:17:27.824]  Totally cheesy.
[01:17:27.824 --> 01:17:29.105]  Great comedy for adults.
[01:17:29.105 --> 01:17:34.791]  A guy in what looks like a $100 monkey suit fighting with a guy in a $100 dinosaur suit.
[01:17:34.791 --> 01:17:39.195]  And, I mean, even the four-year-old doesn't get scared by it, so we let him watch that every once in a while.
[01:17:39.195 --> 01:17:40.556]  But the whole thing is how the U.N.
[01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:41.577]  army's this, the U.N.
[01:17:41.577 --> 01:17:42.798]  army that, the U.N.
[01:17:42.798 --> 01:17:43.679]  sub, the U.N.
[01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:44.440]  satellite.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.882]  The propaganda's always been there.
[01:17:46.882 --> 01:17:47.803]  It's everywhere.
[01:17:47.803 --> 01:17:50.005]  I even let the kids occasionally watch Mayberry.
[01:17:51.027 --> 01:17:53.751]  You know, the Andy Griffith Show.
[01:17:53.751 --> 01:17:55.974]  And it's got propaganda in it.
[01:17:55.974 --> 01:17:56.896]  Well said, my friend.
[01:17:58.123 --> 01:18:06.467]  Another thing, Alex, is that I don't understand how... I mean, we're totally in the system, it's totally in our face, and I don't know how people can deny it now.
[01:18:06.467 --> 01:18:08.308]  There's no denying it anymore.
[01:18:08.308 --> 01:18:14.511]  Well, questioning known liars, they actually say, I've seen articles saying it's a conspiracy theory that there's higher inflation.
[01:18:14.511 --> 01:18:17.073]  It's a conspiracy theory there's world government.
[01:18:17.073 --> 01:18:19.114]  Questioning known liars.
[01:18:19.114 --> 01:18:21.495]  I know I say this a lot, folks, because it's so true.
[01:18:21.495 --> 01:18:23.356]  If you question known liars,
[01:18:24.443 --> 01:18:26.805]  You are a conspiracy theorist.
[01:18:26.805 --> 01:18:28.706]  You're supposed to just believe known liars.
[01:18:28.706 --> 01:18:29.746]  Thank you for the call.
[01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:32.248]  Peter in Washington, and I'll hold you over if your call goes long.
[01:18:32.248 --> 01:18:34.729]  Go ahead.
[01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:35.310]  Hello?
[01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:36.751]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:36.751 --> 01:18:39.152]  Yeah, this is a small thing.
[01:18:39.152 --> 01:18:46.757]  I want to read the, refer to the Stanford Magazine, which is well known as the Harvard of the West.
[01:18:48.101 --> 01:18:58.847]  And the cover story says, the help with the fortune that made from eBay and the cachet of Hollywood, Jeff Skoll, tackles the world's most dire problems.
[01:18:58.847 --> 01:19:03.329]  Now, I'm not going to refer to much of the article, but I'll read this sentence.
[01:19:03.329 --> 01:19:12.094]  Skoll, who has promised to give away the majority of his wealth as part of the Bill Gates-Warren Buffett philanthropic pledge, seems personally content.
[01:19:13.713 --> 01:19:17.775]  Uh, just one more name to add to your list, and that's all I'll say.
[01:19:17.775 --> 01:19:18.915]  Okay?
[01:19:18.915 --> 01:19:19.635]  Thank you, sir.
[01:19:19.635 --> 01:19:27.819]  I mean, the point here is, this is a club the billionaires get in where they're tax-exempt and get to make even bigger profits.
[01:19:27.819 --> 01:19:31.200]  I hope folks understand this is all a scam.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.962]  I understand it's a scam, and I just wanted one more name to the list, okay?
[01:19:35.962 --> 01:19:36.742]  No, no, thank you, sir.
[01:19:36.742 --> 01:19:37.662]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:19:41.155 --> 01:19:47.379]  I'll just say that I graduated from Stanford many years ago, and I've watched the trend.
[01:19:47.379 --> 01:19:55.283]  It's gone from liberal to globalist liberal, and I just thought I'd mention it on the show.
[01:19:55.283 --> 01:19:56.524]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:19:56.524 --> 01:19:57.104]  Thank you, sir.
[01:19:57.104 --> 01:19:59.806]  We'll be right back with some big news on the TSA that just broke.

[01:21:31.577 --> 01:21:36.140]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:41.944]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:21:41.944 --> 01:21:45.586]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:23:01.698 --> 01:23:05.061]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:23:05.061 --> 01:23:13.248]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:23:13.248 --> 01:23:18.572]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.

[01:23:30.622 --> 01:23:34.625]  In a coming-apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:38.427]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA.
[01:23:38.427 --> 01:23:44.010]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, towline, or boating.

[01:23:55.937 --> 01:23:58.579]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:15.059]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, you can see just a smattering of children's toys.
[01:24:15.059 --> 01:24:16.420]  You can get at Toys R Us or anywhere.
[01:24:17.526 --> 01:24:25.509]  That's police and military heroes set wearing black ski masks and they've all got hateful looks on their faces.
[01:24:25.509 --> 01:24:33.652]  When I was just a child, you know, the bad guys would have those type of looks on their faces and the good guys would be smiling or have a normal face.
[01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:37.854]  But now the good guys have hateful looks showing their teeth.
[01:24:37.854 --> 01:24:41.095]  And they'll have a good checkpoint for you and give you a forced inoculation.
[01:24:41.095 --> 01:24:43.156]  And if you pan over here, almost every toy.
[01:24:44.278 --> 01:24:45.099]  Well, not almost.
[01:24:45.099 --> 01:24:46.180]  I can never find U.S.
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:48.422]  military toys.
[01:24:48.422 --> 01:24:50.023]  World Peacekeepers.
[01:24:50.023 --> 01:24:59.211]  And every show, whether it's the Fantastic Four, old or new, whatever show I see, cartoons, because quite frankly, when I do watch TV occasionally, I don't watch cartoons.
[01:24:59.211 --> 01:25:02.253]  I mean, it's just all anti-family, anti-America, U.N.
[01:25:02.253 --> 01:25:03.054]  saving us.
[01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:06.196]  When aliens attack the Earth, it's the U.N.
[01:25:06.196 --> 01:25:07.638]  It's predictive programming.
[01:25:07.638 --> 01:25:10.280]  World Peacekeepers.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.121]  12 inches, fully.
[01:25:12.878 --> 01:25:23.081]  Posable action figure and accessories and he is a military special force of world peacekeeping.
[01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:38.706]  And now I see the military ads and it's like something out of a dystopic futuristic movie where if I wanted to show an evil force but it's propaganda ads of a force for good, a force to fight evil and tyranny everywhere.
[01:25:39.486 --> 01:25:41.767]  That's the Marines!
[01:25:41.767 --> 01:25:43.247]  And it's not even a good voiceover guy.
[01:25:43.247 --> 01:25:45.028]  I was watching this in the office the other night.
[01:25:45.028 --> 01:25:50.689]  It sounds like a guy trying to sound fake tough like, A force for good.
[01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:54.170]  A force globally for freedom.
[01:25:54.170 --> 01:25:58.031]  We run towards the threat.
[01:25:58.031 --> 01:26:02.113]  But it wasn't even like a cool voice like, Battling tyranny worldwide.
[01:26:02.113 --> 01:26:03.973]  Doing what it takes to defend the Republic.
[01:26:03.973 --> 01:26:06.574]  It was like, I'm big, I'm bad!
[01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:13.011]  Even more awesomer!
[01:26:13.011 --> 01:26:13.992]  Alright, I'm now ranting.
[01:26:13.992 --> 01:26:29.243]  If you're not watching on the radio, all you gotta do is, if you're not watching on prisonpanda.tv and you're listening to the radio, all you gotta do is just pull into a toy store and walk into the military toy section, and it's all global government.
[01:26:29.243 --> 01:26:30.283]  These are the good guys right here.
[01:26:33.223 --> 01:26:35.704]  That's the tough guys over there.
[01:26:35.704 --> 01:26:37.184]  Radio listeners are like, what are you talking about?
[01:26:37.184 --> 01:26:38.405]  Well, anybody with children's seen it.
[01:26:38.405 --> 01:26:43.427]  For the last decade, you can find nothing but UN police toys.
[01:26:43.427 --> 01:26:44.667]  Even the Playmobil things.
[01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:47.949]  It's like, oh, Checkpoint Police.
[01:26:47.949 --> 01:26:49.889]  Oh, Checkpoint Army.
[01:26:49.889 --> 01:26:50.970]  Oh, TSA Police.
[01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:54.391]  It actually shows the Playmobil groping people.
[01:26:54.391 --> 01:26:56.212]  So this is just the full conditioning.
[01:26:56.212 --> 01:26:57.952]  They have microwave oven little deals.
[01:26:57.952 --> 01:26:59.753]  Oh, put the toy in there.
[01:26:59.753 --> 01:27:01.053]  Let's go to Dennis in Iowa.
[01:27:01.053 --> 01:27:01.934]  Dennis, you're on the air.
[01:27:01.934 --> 01:27:02.254]  Welcome.
[01:27:03.325 --> 01:27:05.166]  Hey, it's a pleasure to talk to you, Alex.
[01:27:05.166 --> 01:27:07.106]  You do a hell of a job, buddy.
[01:27:07.106 --> 01:27:08.767]  Well, I try.
[01:27:08.767 --> 01:27:09.807]  Yeah, well, you try.
[01:27:09.807 --> 01:27:10.527]  Very good.
[01:27:10.527 --> 01:27:21.830]  Hey, I was wondering, for your listeners, and I want to ask you if you also know about this, Chuckie G. Schumer and Scott Brown have been putting legislation out there.
[01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:26.752]  They want to bring in 11,000 more E3 visa workers.
[01:27:26.752 --> 01:27:30.033]  In this country, when so many Americans are out of work now,
[01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:37.769]  And then by the time you add into the visas for all their spouses and children, this is a big deal in my mind.
[01:27:37.769 --> 01:27:38.851]  Have you heard about it?
[01:27:38.851 --> 01:27:43.056]  And I just wanted to let your listeners know about it, in case they haven't heard about it.
[01:27:43.056 --> 01:27:45.559]  Yeah, that's the highly skilled people, right?
[01:27:45.559 --> 01:27:46.240]  No, no.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.822]  That's the low skilled.
[01:27:50.558 --> 01:27:54.239]  Is that they have two years of minimal work experience in the field?
[01:27:54.239 --> 01:27:54.939]  No, I've seen that.
[01:27:54.939 --> 01:27:59.220]  I've seen that they want the unskilled visas, which are pointless, and they want more high-skilled ones.
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:10.524]  All I know is that the high-skilled people come here, learn their trade, and then are sent back by the globalists to set up factories overseas, and then there's tax incentives to leave the United States.
[01:28:10.524 --> 01:28:15.165]  But yeah, I did see a blurb a few weeks ago that they want more unskilled visas, which are just pointless.
[01:28:16.065 --> 01:28:17.286]  So that's a good point.
[01:28:17.286 --> 01:28:20.887]  I mean, look, none of these other countries allow this type of exploitation.
[01:28:20.887 --> 01:28:23.348]  Globalism has not been good for our country.
[01:28:23.348 --> 01:28:24.588]  And I'm glad you mentioned that.
[01:28:24.588 --> 01:28:30.850]  I get confused all the visa terms and names, but I need to look into that more.
[01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:33.291]  Another short funny thing for you, Alex.
[01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:35.492]  I'm a registered independent.
[01:28:35.492 --> 01:28:44.735]  I have gotten like five times now in the mail this crap from Obama campaign with this pretty little black and white picture in it wanting me to donate.
[01:28:45.572 --> 01:28:52.839]  I pull the envelope out, and even on the envelope it says you can save our campaign money if you place a stamp on it.
[01:28:52.839 --> 01:28:58.184]  It is postage paid, but you can save us money if you put your own stamp on it.
[01:28:58.184 --> 01:29:00.026]  I don't put a stamp on it.
[01:29:00.026 --> 01:29:03.850]  I drop a washer in the envelope, I seal it, and I mail it back to them.
[01:29:06.389 --> 01:29:08.110]  Just a little, just a little humor there.
[01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:25.142]  The funny thing is, as I keep getting them back again, I mean, the same thing in the mail.
[01:29:25.142 --> 01:29:28.363]  I mean, you would think they would stop and, hey, let's do it.
[01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:35.307]  It's all robotically done, and that's how you can beat this automated globalist system, is that they just count on you complying with it.
[01:29:35.307 --> 01:29:39.308]  By the way, the TSA now says, pay them $100, and they won't grope you.
[01:29:39.308 --> 01:29:40.449]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:29:40.449 --> 01:29:41.630]  I'm not joking.
[01:29:41.630 --> 01:29:46.032]  $100 to fly through the airport without a groping.
[01:29:46.032 --> 01:29:47.412]  Pay them protection money.
[01:29:47.412 --> 01:29:48.313]  I might actually pay it.
[01:29:48.313 --> 01:29:48.733]  I'm joking.
[01:29:50.236 --> 01:29:54.158]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.158 --> 01:30:01.482]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.482 --> 01:30:02.562]  I had tried everything.
[01:30:02.562 --> 01:30:08.045]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:30:08.045 --> 01:30:12.868]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:30:12.868 --> 01:30:19.251]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:30.937]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:30.937 --> 01:30:35.419]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:30:35.419 --> 01:30:41.662]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:41.662 --> 01:30:42.823]  Now that's results.

[01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:27.710]  We are back live.
[01:33:27.710 --> 01:33:30.951]  I'm Alex Jones, your host here on this Friday edition.
[01:33:30.951 --> 01:33:33.252]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:33.252 --> 01:33:41.495]  We have Congressman Jones joining us, and I really appreciate Representative Walter B. Jones coming on.
[01:33:41.495 --> 01:33:42.996]  He was first one of the U.S.
[01:33:42.996 --> 01:33:48.918]  House of Representatives in 95, after serving 10 years as an elected member of the North Carolina General Assembly.
[01:33:48.918 --> 01:33:55.160]  He's currently serving his ninth term in Congress, and he's the only member of Congress I've read about who's actually personally signed a letter
[01:33:56.229 --> 01:34:07.038]  To each and every family and written a personal letter to 10,000 plus families of servicemen that have been killed in the line of duty.
[01:34:07.038 --> 01:34:11.162]  And again, that is a personal touch.
[01:34:11.162 --> 01:34:18.228]  It is so important that members of Congress do that when they are ultimately sending people into these wars.
[01:34:18.228 --> 01:34:19.629]  We appreciate him doing that as well.
[01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:20.951]  I don't
[01:34:36.627 --> 01:34:41.888]  That was wrong when he said, no, we don't need congressional approval or authorization to go to war.
[01:34:41.888 --> 01:34:43.889]  We get that from the UN and NATO.
[01:34:43.889 --> 01:34:51.651]  We've seen members of the Supreme Court, current and former, say we should get our law from the UN, which has such a terrible past.
[01:34:51.651 --> 01:34:55.472]  America has been the example of liberty, not the United Nations.
[01:34:55.472 --> 01:35:02.014]  But the Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 states it's a high crime impeachable if any president
[01:35:02.674 --> 01:35:05.055]  Launches wars without congressional approval.
[01:35:05.055 --> 01:35:13.260]  Now when you do that, not just on your own, but say a foreign power authorizes you, I think that rises even above a high crime.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:17.743]  And joining us is the congressman from North Carolina, Walter Jones.
[01:35:17.743 --> 01:35:27.728]  Sir, thank you very much for joining us and introducing legislation to hold any president accountable if they try to launch wars without congressional approval.
[01:35:27.728 --> 01:35:28.349]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:35:29.178 --> 01:35:30.359]  Well Alex, thank you.
[01:35:30.359 --> 01:35:37.464]  My concern goes back, the initial concern was when President Clinton decided to bomb Bosnia without approval of Congress.
[01:35:37.464 --> 01:35:42.827]  I joined 31 members of the House, 3 Democrats and 28 Republicans.
[01:35:42.827 --> 01:35:49.892]  Joined Congressman at the time, Tom Campbell, who now is a constitutional law professor at Stanford University.
[01:35:49.892 --> 01:35:53.815]  We went to the federal courts by saying that the President had bypassed Congress.
[01:35:54.415 --> 01:36:01.004]  And the courts did not take the lawsuit because they said, well, you in Congress have the authority to cut the budgets.
[01:36:01.004 --> 01:36:09.656]  And I mention that, Alex, because that's always difficult for members to cut the funding for war because they don't want to leave the kids over there without adequate equipment.
[01:36:10.337 --> 01:36:20.921]  And then, when Mr. Obama went into Libya and he bypassed Congress, except he did say that he had spoken to the leadership, well that made me even more anxious.
[01:36:20.921 --> 01:36:25.962]  I joined Dennis Kucinich and Jonathan Turley, who's a constitutional lawyer at George Washington University.
[01:36:25.962 --> 01:36:27.243]  We went back to the courts.
[01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:34.197]  The courts did not accept by using the same position where you have the authority to cut the funding.
[01:36:34.197 --> 01:36:35.918]  Well, that never happens.
[01:36:35.918 --> 01:36:46.622]  I've been so anxious and upset that we in Congress, we never get a chance to debate the policy of should we still be in war or not in war.
[01:36:46.622 --> 01:36:47.923]  So I decided to put this
[01:36:48.584 --> 01:36:58.219]  Uh, House Concurrent Resolution 107, and before I even knew about, uh, uh, uh, Secretary Sessions, excuse me, Senator Sessions and Secretary of Defense Panetta.
[01:36:59.008 --> 01:37:06.491]  And I would like to read two quotes that I think give so much credibility to what we're trying to do with this resolution.
[01:37:06.491 --> 01:37:08.892]  One is from Vice President Dick Cheney.
[01:37:08.892 --> 01:37:13.413]  When we went into Iraq, which was an unnecessary war, I came out against it.
[01:37:13.413 --> 01:37:18.155]  And Vice President Cheney made the statement that I want to read to your listeners.
[01:37:18.975 --> 01:37:24.282]  Uh, the President does not need authorization from Congress before launching a military offensive.
[01:37:24.282 --> 01:37:28.727]  That was Dick Cheney during the, uh, President George Bush administration.
[01:37:28.727 --> 01:37:34.413]  Now let me read to you a candidate, uh, Senator Obama in 2007, and these are his words.
[01:37:36.644 --> 01:37:48.115]  The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual immediate threat to the nation.
[01:37:48.115 --> 01:37:51.758]  That's exactly what I'm saying with this resolution.
[01:37:51.758 --> 01:37:55.462]  If we are attacked, then the President does have the authority based on the Constitution.
[01:37:55.962 --> 01:38:04.947]  But he does not have the constitutional power just to make a decision, well, I don't like the dictator in Libya so we're going to go there and bomb him.
[01:38:04.947 --> 01:38:12.771]  I mean, we need to go back to the Constitution and this will help Congress be more involved in the debate when we go to war.
[01:38:14.434 --> 01:38:16.216]  Well said, Congressman.
[01:38:16.216 --> 01:38:30.750]  Of course, Senator Sessions said that he almost lost his breath whenever he kept saying to Panetta over and over again, the Secretary of Defense last week, Sir, you know Congress is over the war powers and you do need our authorization.
[01:38:31.391 --> 01:38:34.712]  And Panetta would say, no, we get that from the UN.
[01:38:34.712 --> 01:38:41.033]  So for me, this is beyond the constitutional question of a president launching wars without congressional approval.
[01:38:41.033 --> 01:38:42.113]  We know that's a high crime.
[01:38:42.113 --> 01:38:43.373]  It's in the Constitution.
[01:38:43.373 --> 01:38:45.593]  A five-year-old that can read can see that.
[01:38:45.593 --> 01:38:46.994]  That's a no-brainer.
[01:38:46.994 --> 01:38:49.174]  Because why even have Congress if that's the case?
[01:38:49.174 --> 01:38:52.075]  If the president can do whatever he wants, you've got to have checks and balances.
[01:38:52.075 --> 01:38:59.876]  But to go further and say we're getting the authority from foreign governments in the UN, I mean, that's like being a foreign agent of a foreign power, sir.
[01:39:01.107 --> 01:39:02.990]  Alex, it is not acceptable.
[01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:09.001]  We have a Constitution like we have a Bible, and the Constitution says that Congress will declare war.
[01:39:09.815 --> 01:39:19.904]  That is why I've been so upset, and I just mentioned to you just a moment ago, my history on this whole issue that went back to President Clinton in Bosnia in 1999.
[01:39:19.904 --> 01:39:25.788]  For too long, Congress has been a spectator in the debate on war.
[01:39:25.788 --> 01:39:35.517]  And when you see the amount of money that we spend, and more important than the money, the number of kids who have died and lost their legs, their arms, the American people should get behind.
[01:39:35.517 --> 01:39:38.259]  And I'm pleased to tell you today, I was honored to be on your show.
[01:39:39.079 --> 01:39:49.702]  That we have had calls since Friday of last week that we have heard from people in 49 different states who have called and said, thank you, Congressman Jones.
[01:39:49.702 --> 01:39:54.363]  We want to help you get this resolution to the floor of the House and get this thing passed.
[01:39:54.363 --> 01:39:56.843]  And I want to thank you again for this opportunity.
[01:39:56.843 --> 01:39:58.464]  I want to thank you, sir.
[01:39:58.464 --> 01:40:03.185]  Now, he's already launched the Libya war last year, and Congress said, you've got to get our approval.
[01:40:03.185 --> 01:40:04.265]  By the way, we're for it.
[01:40:04.625 --> 01:40:04.945]  I don't know.
[01:40:25.573 --> 01:40:29.196]  The Congress has been handing over its authority, but still doesn't mean that it's legitimate.
[01:40:56.313 --> 01:40:58.914]  Well, I have publicly endorsed Ron Paul.
[01:40:58.914 --> 01:41:06.116]  I am a big supporter of Ron Paul's, and I do agree with him totally, and you made mention of this.
[01:41:06.116 --> 01:41:14.278]  What happened was our own Republican leadership, Alex, would not allow even a weak resolution to condemn
[01:41:14.998 --> 01:41:16.939]  What the President had done in Libya.
[01:41:16.939 --> 01:41:19.379]  He would allow Republicans to bring it to the floor.
[01:41:19.379 --> 01:41:27.942]  I was so disappointed in our leadership, Republican leadership, because they just sat back and, like I was saying a while ago, they became spectators.
[01:41:27.942 --> 01:41:33.203]  We have got to fight to defend the constitutional right of the Congress to declare war.
[01:41:33.203 --> 01:41:35.424]  And this is a step in that direction.
[01:41:35.424 --> 01:41:39.065]  We will get a hearing, I hope, I hope, in the Judiciary Committee.
[01:41:39.685 --> 01:41:49.352]  I know that the Judiciary Committee chaired by Congressman Lamar Spear from Texas, who's a fine man, and the Ranking Member, who's a fine man, John Conyers.
[01:41:49.352 --> 01:41:53.635]  And we need to hold a hearing on this whole issue of Congress and war.
[01:41:53.635 --> 01:41:54.596]  And this is a start.
[01:41:54.596 --> 01:41:59.519]  This resolution is a major step in that direction.
[01:41:59.519 --> 01:42:01.320]  Well said, Congressman.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:06.384]  What can we do to help move this legislation through the House and get it passed?
[01:42:07.279 --> 01:42:25.645]  If your listeners would call their members of the United States House of Representatives, and I hope soon we'll have a Senate Senator to introduce the same legislation, but right now, if your listeners would call their members of Congress and say, please co-sponsor HCON Resolution 107,
[01:42:27.612 --> 01:42:41.871]  All they have to do is to call their member of Congress or email them or fax them and just say, please join in this house effort to bring back the constitutional authority of Congress to be involved when it comes to debating war.
[01:42:42.646 --> 01:42:43.787]  And that's what they need to do.
[01:43:13.907 --> 01:43:30.200]  Again, we're talking to Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina, and I'm glad people are calling and thanking him, but I think what's more important is to call the head of the Judiciary Committee to ask them to get behind it and start promoting it, to call the media and say, don't black this out.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:40.765]  And to call people like Senator Rand Paul and say, look, you've talked a lot about this war power issue, your father has, you need to co-sponsor this immediately in the Senate.
[01:43:40.765 --> 01:43:43.626]  I would imagine that Senator DeMint would want to get behind this.
[01:43:43.626 --> 01:43:50.069]  I would imagine that Senator Sessions, who was so flabbergasted, Congressman, would want to get behind this right now.
[01:43:51.035 --> 01:43:53.075]  Well, I'm going to reach out to him Monday.
[01:43:53.075 --> 01:43:54.556]  We will be back in Washington.
[01:43:54.556 --> 01:44:00.397]  I've already asked my staff to call his office to see if he could give me 10 minutes by telephone.
[01:44:00.397 --> 01:44:04.898]  I think he will see the value of trying to introduce us on the Senate side.
[01:44:04.898 --> 01:44:06.478]  And let's debate this issue.
[01:44:06.478 --> 01:44:13.680]  It is time for Congress to get out of the stands and get on the field when we talk about sending our young men and women to die.
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:17.461]  What are folks saying in North Carolina, especially in your district, the 3rd District?
[01:44:19.433 --> 01:44:21.754]  Alex, I'm not, I don't want to mislead anything.
[01:44:21.754 --> 01:44:30.136]  I'm a man of integrity and honesty and I would tell you that the phones, the emails have been overwhelming in behalf of this legislation.
[01:44:30.136 --> 01:44:31.797]  So, well that's what I've seen.
[01:44:31.797 --> 01:44:33.777]  Now, what about the semi-blackout?
[01:44:33.777 --> 01:44:35.658]  Drudge Report covered it.
[01:44:35.658 --> 01:44:36.298]  I've covered it.
[01:44:36.298 --> 01:44:37.779]  InfoWars.com covered it.
[01:44:37.779 --> 01:44:38.879]  WorldNetDaily covered it.
[01:44:38.879 --> 01:44:40.039]  I do a search every day.
[01:44:40.039 --> 01:44:44.180]  A few local newspapers in North Carolina mentioned it.
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:45.661]  Other than that, nothing.
[01:44:46.261 --> 01:44:46.662]  Nothing.
[01:44:46.662 --> 01:44:58.471]  You would think that a law to begin impeaching any president who tries to power grab like this, that a move towards that could lead to impeachment, that would be huge news.
[01:44:58.471 --> 01:45:03.154]  And you can tell they're scared of this because there's been such a blackout.
[01:45:03.154 --> 01:45:05.016]  How do we force this issue out there?
[01:45:06.465 --> 01:45:12.169]  Alex, I think letters to the editors or emails to the national papers or local papers.
[01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:20.755]  My local paper, they did an editorial that they did not understand that we had changed the word the president, which means only Obama, to a president.
[01:45:20.755 --> 01:45:21.855]  And they wrote an editorial.
[01:45:21.855 --> 01:45:25.538]  It was not overly critical, but it just did not understand the intent.
[01:45:25.538 --> 01:45:26.518]  I called the editor.
[01:45:26.518 --> 01:45:27.699]  He's a very nice young man.
[01:45:27.699 --> 01:45:36.025]  And I said, I wish you'd call me before you did that editorial, because you would understand that this deals primarily with getting Congress back into the debate.
[01:45:36.685 --> 01:45:45.892]  I am sick and tired of being told, well, the only time you can debate whether we should be or not be in Afghanistan is when we have the appropriations bill dealing with funding the war.
[01:45:45.892 --> 01:45:47.493]  Yeah, I'm going to be, sure.
[01:45:47.493 --> 01:45:48.154]  Excuse me.
[01:45:48.154 --> 01:45:48.714]  Go ahead.
[01:45:48.714 --> 01:45:49.035]  I'm sorry.
[01:45:49.035 --> 01:45:49.635]  No, no, you go ahead.
[01:45:49.635 --> 01:45:50.476]  I interrupted you.
[01:45:50.476 --> 01:45:51.977]  No, no, no, no.
[01:45:51.977 --> 01:46:00.884]  We should have the authority to have, when President Obama is saying, well, you gave President Bush the authority in 2001 or 2002, and that's the authority I'm using.
[01:46:03.744 --> 01:46:11.974]  For goodness sakes, 11 years later, we shouldn't be debating whether we should be there or not be there sometime in that 11 year period of time.
[01:46:11.974 --> 01:46:14.618]  So this is a start on that whole debate, quite frankly.
[01:46:16.104 --> 01:46:19.147]  Well, Congressman, we've only got about five minutes left with you, and you've got to run.
[01:46:19.147 --> 01:46:20.769]  We just appreciate what you're doing.
[01:46:20.769 --> 01:46:23.792]  My question is, why don't we see more people?
[01:46:23.792 --> 01:46:25.654]  Why is it just you, Ron Paul?
[01:46:25.654 --> 01:46:32.381]  Dennis Kucinich, you know, got redistricting out of his constituency, railroaded out.
[01:46:32.381 --> 01:46:36.325]  And so there's not many people that'll just stand for the basic Constitution.
[01:46:36.325 --> 01:46:37.527]  For those that don't know history,
[01:46:38.587 --> 01:46:41.689]  It happens in third world countries, it happened in Rome with Caesar.
[01:46:41.689 --> 01:46:50.815]  When a president or a leader, the chief executive, starts trying to take the military under their own control, that's always the biggest red flag.
[01:46:50.815 --> 01:47:05.644]  As you said in your letter dealing with this, the cornerstone of our republic is the war powers, is that the Congress is in control of this, and this is one of the biggest issues out there.
[01:47:05.644 --> 01:47:07.966]  Alex, our country is financially broke.
[01:47:08.948 --> 01:47:15.570]  We're just the young men and women that have fought for this country in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:16.931]  I've seen the broken legs.
[01:47:16.931 --> 01:47:18.231]  I've seen the amputated legs.
[01:47:18.231 --> 01:47:20.392]  I've seen the paralyzed bodies.
[01:47:20.392 --> 01:47:30.096]  The American people need to say that we no longer will send our young men and women to fight overseas unless Congress does its job that is based on the Constitution.
[01:47:30.096 --> 01:47:36.258]  And again, HCON Resolution 107 is a start to get Congress back into the game of war.
[01:47:38.749 --> 01:47:39.630]  Well said.
[01:47:39.630 --> 01:47:43.193]  Look, I'm not trying to tell Ron Paul, sir, what to do.
[01:47:43.193 --> 01:47:44.594]  And I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
[01:47:44.594 --> 01:47:55.082]  But what about, if this gets ignored, just going ahead because the crime is ongoing, now they want to send AFRICOM into all these countries for the globalists to grab resources.
[01:47:55.082 --> 01:47:57.544]  They're trying to expand all these other wars, proxy wars.
[01:47:58.685 --> 01:48:02.186]  What about just going ahead with a move for impeachment?
[01:48:02.186 --> 01:48:07.067]  Perhaps if they're ignoring a law that says if you don't do this, impeachment's triggered.
[01:48:07.067 --> 01:48:09.508]  What about just going ahead with the impeachment?
[01:48:09.508 --> 01:48:13.509]  I mean, why doesn't Ron Paul just go ahead and introduce articles of impeachment?
[01:48:13.509 --> 01:48:16.129]  We've got plenty of it to go after Obama.
[01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:20.050]  And I understand you're seeing any president, but I don't care if it's political.
[01:48:20.050 --> 01:48:26.492]  I mean, I know you were critical of this when Republicans were doing things similar, but not rising to this level.
[01:48:27.688 --> 01:48:43.147]  Well, Alex, I think if people like you across this nation will continue to beat the drum for HCON Resolution 107, I think this will lead to other avenues that need to be led to that you're making mention of.
[01:48:43.806 --> 01:48:59.151]  But right now, to show that my leadership in the Republican House, we are the majority in the House, they need to be speaking out about bringing this bill to the Jay Committee, because it's important, because we're talking about the Constitution.
[01:48:59.151 --> 01:48:59.632]  I'm with you 100%.
[01:49:01.496 --> 01:49:08.722]  Well, Congressman, I want to give you closing comments here in the last three minutes or so, but just bring up another issue that's part of this.
[01:49:08.722 --> 01:49:19.470]  The National Defense Authorization Act that Obama said he wouldn't sign, then it turns out he demanded this power to secretly arrest and disappear Americans right out of Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.
[01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:24.634]  Then he signed it, you know, on New Year's Eve so nobody would notice.
[01:49:24.634 --> 01:49:26.455]  I mean, this is really creepy.
[01:49:26.455 --> 01:49:28.317]  What's the sense of Congress about this?
[01:49:29.195 --> 01:49:37.378]  Well, Alex, I don't have the record, but I think I was one of about six or seven Republicans that voted no for that simple reason.
[01:49:37.378 --> 01:49:49.481]  That provision in there gives unlimited authority to a president, no matter who that president is, to determine who he thinks is a terrorist, and it could be an American citizen, and take him out.
[01:49:49.481 --> 01:49:50.842]  I'm with you 100% on that.
[01:49:50.842 --> 01:49:51.902]  That's why I voted against it.
[01:49:52.537 --> 01:49:53.678]  Well I'm glad you're there.
[01:49:53.678 --> 01:49:57.721]  Ron Paul says he's going to retire if he doesn't win the presidency.
[01:49:57.721 --> 01:50:04.347]  I'd like him to reconsider that and I hope you keep running and keep winning because there's not many good guys up there.
[01:50:04.347 --> 01:50:06.429]  Is anybody else starting to wake up up there?
[01:50:07.742 --> 01:50:16.566]  Slowly there are a few that are beginning to wake up, and Justin Amash from Michigan is a disciple of Ron Paul.
[01:50:16.566 --> 01:50:18.287]  He's a wonderful young member of Congress.
[01:50:18.287 --> 01:50:28.031]  He's only been there one year, but he values the words in the Constitution like I do, and there's no two more important documents than the Bible and the Constitution.
[01:50:28.031 --> 01:50:29.052]  They've got to be protected.
[01:50:29.813 --> 01:50:38.837]  Wow, Congressman Walter Jones, thank you for your courage and thank you for standing up for our Republic in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:50:38.837 --> 01:50:41.619]  Thank you so much for your time and hopefully you can give us an update in a few weeks.
[01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:43.669]  Alex, I look forward to that.
[01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:44.870]  Thank you for this opportunity.
[01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:47.490]  God, please continue to bless our men and women in uniform.
[01:50:47.490 --> 01:50:48.251]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:48.251 --> 01:50:49.411]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:49.411 --> 01:50:54.452]  All right, there goes Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina.
[01:50:54.452 --> 01:50:58.873]  We've got more of your calls coming up, and I just got handed an InfoWars article that blew me away.
[01:50:58.873 --> 01:51:00.034]  I'll tell you, I don't want to get back.
[01:51:00.034 --> 01:51:00.234]  Whoa.
[01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:01.394]  Whoa!
[01:51:01.394 --> 01:51:03.955]  I've seen the Longevity products work for many others.
[01:51:03.955 --> 01:51:10.076]  And so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[01:51:10.076 --> 01:51:14.277]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds.
[01:51:14.277 --> 01:51:17.998]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.
[01:51:17.998 --> 01:51:21.478]  I started taking the Longevity products and it's been incredible.
[01:51:21.478 --> 01:51:23.599]  37 pounds in two months.
[01:51:24.099 --> 01:51:27.580]  Our bodies are amazing, and God gave us an incredible gift.
[01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:36.464]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[01:51:36.464 --> 01:51:37.664]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[01:51:37.664 --> 01:51:41.926]  I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself and I truly believe in.
[01:51:41.926 --> 01:51:48.009]  And the amazing supplements available at mfallwarsteam.com have certainly delivered my life.
[01:51:48.009 --> 01:51:49.049]  I hope you'll give them a try.
[01:51:49.249 --> 01:51:58.335]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:51:58.335 --> 01:52:00.116]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:52:04.195 --> 01:52:09.378]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:52:09.378 --> 01:52:11.239]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:52:11.239 --> 01:52:14.761]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:22.245]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:52:22.245 --> 01:52:26.728]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:52:26.728 --> 01:52:32.471]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:52:32.811 --> 01:52:34.612]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[01:52:34.612 --> 01:52:41.277]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:52:41.277 --> 01:52:50.223]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[01:52:50.223 --> 01:52:55.967]  Call 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[01:52:55.967 --> 01:52:58.909]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[01:53:03.424 --> 01:53:04.665]  Claire, it's Anne.
[01:53:04.665 --> 01:53:07.626]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[01:53:07.626 --> 01:53:08.667]  The all-natural one.
[01:53:08.667 --> 01:53:09.127]  Ambrin?
[01:53:09.127 --> 01:53:10.568]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[01:53:10.568 --> 01:53:17.752]  Not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[01:53:17.752 --> 01:53:19.573]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[01:53:19.573 --> 01:53:20.094]  It's gone.
[01:53:20.094 --> 01:53:22.555]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[01:53:22.555 --> 01:53:23.396]  I feel great.
[01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:23.916]  Give me a call.
[01:53:24.056 --> 01:53:27.737]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[01:53:27.737 --> 01:53:31.538]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[01:53:31.538 --> 01:53:35.960]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:38.221]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[01:53:38.221 --> 01:53:41.322]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[01:53:41.322 --> 01:53:45.783]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.
[01:53:45.783 --> 01:53:51.225]  Be one of the first 50 callers right now, and they'll send you a complimentary risk-free trial with a 30-day supply.
[01:53:51.545 --> 01:53:53.566]  Oh yeah, strange days have found us alright.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:26.163]  Okay, we have Richard Stallman, one of the inventors of GNU that became Linux on, you know, a real expert on how all these systems are integrated.
[01:54:26.163 --> 01:54:35.066]  And he agreed with my analysis that these megacorporations allied with government are engineering into all major appliances globally.
[01:54:35.066 --> 01:54:38.447]  You pay for it in the product.
[01:54:38.447 --> 01:54:43.629]  It costs more, but every product has it, so it's a hidden tax, so they can surveil you.
[01:54:43.629 --> 01:54:45.470]  You think smart meters are bad.
[01:54:46.584 --> 01:54:51.368]  You've not seen anything yet.
[01:54:51.368 --> 01:55:01.637]  All of the new washing machines, dryers, computers, iPhones, have cameras that are two-way, have audio that's two-way, and they admit they're tracking you, and
[01:55:03.035 --> 01:55:18.721]  There is a report out of Wired Magazine with public statements by Petraeus, now the head of the CIA, that they are watching everybody through their appliances without warrants and they'll do whatever they want.
[01:55:18.721 --> 01:55:21.822]  And you're not a suspect, you're a person of interest.
[01:55:21.822 --> 01:55:23.643]  What, because we expose that you run Al-Qaeda?
[01:55:23.643 --> 01:55:26.484]  You mean stuff like that?
[01:55:26.484 --> 01:55:32.006]  So these people are just going into a new phase of flaunting it all in our face.
[01:55:34.730 --> 01:55:42.558]  Wow, he's quoted in here, global information surveillance grid being constructed, willing Americans embrace gadgets, use a spy on them.
[01:55:42.558 --> 01:55:46.722]  CIA head, we will spy on Americans through electrical appliances.
[01:55:46.722 --> 01:55:57.112]  And now that we've exposed that Google was founded by NSA, CIA, they just admit now that, oh yeah, the former head of DARPA runs it, and yeah, it's all...
[01:55:58.095 --> 01:56:07.642]  CIA Director David Petraeus said that the rise of smart gadgets means the Americans are effectively bugging their own homes, saving U.S.
[01:56:07.642 --> 01:56:11.244]  spy agencies a job when it identifies any persons of interest.
[01:56:11.244 --> 01:56:14.847]  And so it's like a big joke in a question and answer he did.
[01:56:14.847 --> 01:56:16.728]  He's like, we're just tracking you!
[01:56:16.728 --> 01:56:24.554]  See, they just convicted that guy who put the webcam in their room with his roommate having sex with another guy.
[01:56:26.022 --> 01:56:31.665]  And they're not convicting him for spying and violating somebody's privacy, it's that it was hateful.
[01:56:31.665 --> 01:56:36.807]  So see, I guess it's only illegal if it's against a gay person.
[01:56:36.807 --> 01:56:38.668]  See, that's that political correctness.
[01:56:38.668 --> 01:56:40.349]  How about it's illegal for everybody?
[01:56:40.349 --> 01:56:46.652]  But why when schools give you laptops that you paid for, but they say they're free, another lie, then they watch you at home.
[01:56:46.652 --> 01:56:47.672]  Remember that?
[01:56:47.672 --> 01:56:50.153]  It's happened in California and Pennsylvania.
[01:56:50.153 --> 01:56:52.414]  It's like, oh yeah, well that's all right, the courts say.
[01:56:52.414 --> 01:56:53.575]  Government can do that, but
[01:56:54.349 --> 01:56:57.690]  But if somebody else does, you're going to jail.
[01:56:57.690 --> 01:57:03.593]  Speaking at a summit for In-Q-Tel, that's the folks that founded, that's the CIA investment arm that founded Google.
[01:57:03.593 --> 01:57:05.194]  A little side issue.
[01:57:05.194 --> 01:57:07.575]  You know, when you're informed, you know stuff like that.
[01:57:07.575 --> 01:57:21.481]  The CIA's technology investment operation, Petraeus, made the comments when discussing new technologies which aim to add processors and web connections to previously dumb household appliances such as fridges, ovens, and lighting systems.
[01:57:21.481 --> 01:57:21.601]  Yeah.
[01:57:21.821 --> 01:57:38.026]  I told you, the police stations all over the country now are getting federal grants for these new light bulbs that can actually have data over the power, that it resonates with new chips in the computers that then spy in your house, and the lights are programming things in your house.
[01:57:38.026 --> 01:57:40.467]  And of course, the cops are the first ones to have it put on them.
[01:57:40.467 --> 01:57:47.029]  Transformational is an overused word, but I do believe it properly applies to these technologies, Petraeus enthused.
[01:57:47.029 --> 01:57:49.710]  Particularly the effect on clandestine tradecraft.
[01:57:50.558 --> 01:57:58.105]  Items of interest, you criminal Petraeus, will be located, identified, monitored, and remotely controlled through technology such as radio frequency identification.
[01:57:58.105 --> 01:57:59.707]  Oh, RFID is a spy on us.
[01:57:59.707 --> 01:58:01.568]  I thought I was a conspiracy theorist.
[01:58:01.568 --> 01:58:11.658]  Sensor networks, tiny embedded servers, and energy harvesters all connected to the next generation of internet using abundant low-cost and high-powered computing.
[01:58:11.658 --> 01:58:12.919]  That's the smart meters.
[01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:14.800]  Everything's a smart spy.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:15.881]  A smart trendy.
[01:58:16.542 --> 01:58:18.322]  By the way, we're getting a bunch of emails and stuff.
[01:58:18.322 --> 01:58:19.603]  People are going crazy.
[01:58:19.603 --> 01:58:22.063]  People in the office are getting it from family.
[01:58:22.063 --> 01:58:24.984]  What is that shirt Alex Jones is wearing?
[01:58:24.984 --> 01:58:26.244]  I haven't plugged anything yet.
[01:58:26.244 --> 01:58:28.745]  You want to fund this, but this is crash commercial.
[01:58:28.745 --> 01:58:29.345]  Plugging.
[01:58:29.345 --> 01:58:32.746]  It's Liberty or Death, Don't Tread on Me, Red and Black T-shirt.
[01:58:32.746 --> 01:58:34.086]  It's already our bestseller.
[01:58:34.086 --> 01:58:37.847]  It's available at Infowars.com.
[01:58:37.847 --> 01:58:41.808]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:41.808 --> 01:58:43.308]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.305 --> 01:58:51.247]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.247 --> 01:58:58.468]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:58:58.468 --> 01:59:11.672]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[01:59:11.892 --> 01:59:16.333]  That our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:59:16.333 --> 01:59:22.515]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there, and discovered Longevity.
[01:59:22.515 --> 01:59:30.677]  The Longevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:59:30.677 --> 01:59:32.117]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.

[01:59:54.194 --> 01:59:56.575]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.575 --> 01:59:59.338]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.936 --> 02:00:10.779]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.779 --> 02:00:12.360]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:13.901]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.901 --> 02:00:18.104]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.104 --> 02:00:22.167]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.127 --> 02:00:25.928]  No one will be able to stop Cobra.
[02:00:25.928 --> 02:00:29.770]  All appliances will be implanted with tracking systems.
[02:00:29.770 --> 02:00:34.052]  The fools will allow me to surveil and control them.
[02:00:34.052 --> 02:00:37.314]  Beyond 1984 is the plan.
[02:00:37.314 --> 02:00:40.695]  Hail Cobra!
[02:00:40.695 --> 02:00:41.796]  We are back live.
[02:00:43.877 --> 02:00:52.344]  Oh man, I tell you, I already knew all this, but just to have, at public meetings, the head of the CIA going, yeah, we're spying on everything you do.
[02:00:52.344 --> 02:00:55.807]  And he goes on to say, this changes our notion of security.
[02:00:55.807 --> 02:00:58.029]  This is their new shy-op, it's just hide it and blame you.
[02:00:58.029 --> 02:01:00.451]  Yeah, we're putting drugs in the water.
[02:01:00.451 --> 02:01:04.354]  Yeah, cancer viruses, we killed most of your family out of cancer.
[02:01:04.354 --> 02:01:06.476]  Free safety, fight Al Qaeda.
[02:01:06.476 --> 02:01:08.638]  Yeah, we're tracking everything you do.
[02:01:08.638 --> 02:01:11.640]  Yeah, yeah, we're gonna control how hot or cold your house is.
[02:01:12.639 --> 02:01:15.061]  You know those new light bulbs were mandated?
[02:01:15.061 --> 02:01:16.542]  They're controlling computers!
[02:01:16.542 --> 02:01:18.263]  They'll control all the appliances!
[02:01:18.263 --> 02:01:23.427]  Because we're the good guys!
[02:01:23.427 --> 02:01:28.231]  I mean, it's just like... Yeah, world government's gonna run everything!
[02:01:28.231 --> 02:01:28.892]  You don't like it?
[02:01:28.892 --> 02:01:33.515]  It doesn't exist, though!
[02:01:33.515 --> 02:01:34.376]  We're the good guys.
[02:01:34.376 --> 02:01:37.018]  We don't trust ourselves around the troops when they got guns, though.
[02:01:38.186 --> 02:01:41.227]  Drink more of that fluoride, we love you!
[02:01:41.227 --> 02:01:44.407]  Sarah in Kentucky, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:01:44.407 --> 02:01:45.247]  Hi Alex.
[02:01:45.247 --> 02:01:46.948]  Hi.
[02:01:46.948 --> 02:01:50.028]  I was calling because my husband went to L.A.
[02:01:50.028 --> 02:01:54.129]  recently for a business trip and he works for an I.T.
[02:01:54.129 --> 02:02:06.112]  contractor and one of the men, they were drinking, of course, and he started kind of running his mouth about the security clearance level he had within, you know,
[02:02:07.009 --> 02:02:10.271]  Intelligence or whatever, because most of it's like software.
[02:02:10.271 --> 02:02:15.733]  Oh yeah, a lot of people would slit their children's throats just to be given a security clearance and feel powerful, yeah.
[02:02:15.733 --> 02:02:25.458]  Yes, well he was talking about this and so my husband jumped on it and he said, you know, my wife, you know, reads about this stuff all the time, talks about this stuff all the time.
[02:02:25.458 --> 02:02:35.023]  He's like, you know, the big fence with the inward barbed wire at LAX and underground bunkers under Denver International Airport.
[02:02:36.164 --> 02:02:40.829]  The guy just looked at him and he was like, oh, it's way worse than that.
[02:02:40.829 --> 02:02:48.378]  And he talked to him a little bit about, you know, his security clearance and what all he was allowed to know and everything.
[02:02:48.378 --> 02:02:52.143]  And then he kind of cut him off and said, you know, I'm talking too much about my work.
[02:02:54.226 --> 02:02:58.951]  Yeah, well we don't need to, you know, these guys all think, they classify stuff that's actually public.
[02:02:58.951 --> 02:03:03.517]  I mean, last time I checked, hundreds of millions of news articles have been classified.
[02:03:03.517 --> 02:03:06.340]  They would classify Washington Post articles.
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:12.727]  And what that means is, when they read something in an agency, they go, this is classified within the agency, because they don't want folks reading it.
[02:03:13.388 --> 02:03:17.794]  Like J. Edgar Hoover would classify within the FBI, you know, reports critical of him.
[02:03:17.794 --> 02:03:22.119]  So really, nobody's as deceived as people inside the system.
[02:03:22.119 --> 02:03:24.021]  But they feel like they've arrived.
[02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:26.585]  They're part of the party.
[02:03:26.585 --> 02:03:30.189]  Look, it's a civilian inmate labor camp program.
[02:03:31.607 --> 02:03:34.288]  It's enemy combatant detainment program.
[02:03:34.288 --> 02:03:36.909]  It's civil unrest detainment program.
[02:03:36.909 --> 02:03:47.353]  Everything that's in the Emergency Centers Establishment Act is exactly what we'd already reverse engineered from congressional stuff, news articles, other things, and sources.
[02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:52.095]  So, I mean, when that came out, it's like they wanted to expand the funding for what was already there.
[02:03:52.095 --> 02:03:52.475]  And it's a
[02:03:53.415 --> 02:03:57.157]  The new economy is going to be arresting people.
[02:03:57.157 --> 02:03:59.678]  The new economy is to disappear people.
[02:03:59.678 --> 02:04:03.920]  The new economy is to turn the military loose domestically.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.221]  And I'm telling you, they're going to have big trouble.
[02:04:06.221 --> 02:04:08.482]  They're already behind with their TSA, all of it.
[02:04:08.982 --> 02:04:11.964]  And a lot of folks are just going to say, you know, I'm tired of this.
[02:04:11.964 --> 02:04:14.906]  And when they try to come for them, they're going to come looking for them.
[02:04:14.906 --> 02:04:23.011]  So all you little, you know, types that love the system and hate America and hate freedom and think you're on the winning team, boy, you're sticking your hand in the alligator's mouth.
[02:04:23.011 --> 02:04:28.214]  I mean, these little punks have no idea that once they start fights, they're not going to be able to finish them.
[02:04:28.974 --> 02:04:30.516]  And I don't want it to go there.
[02:04:30.516 --> 02:04:32.118]  I'd rather him wake up and be good people.
[02:04:32.118 --> 02:04:33.399]  But you know what?
[02:04:33.399 --> 02:04:36.123]  Scums sometimes have got to get run over.
[02:04:36.123 --> 02:04:37.705]  And they're going to get run over.
[02:04:37.705 --> 02:04:39.627]  I mean, what does your husband say to this guy?
[02:04:39.627 --> 02:04:41.329]  I mean, was he proud of the tyranny?
[02:04:41.329 --> 02:04:42.831]  Or was he, like, just kind of bragging?
[02:04:43.871 --> 02:04:49.975]  Well, I think he was kind of bragging, but the mentality gets me that Hitler did the same thing.
[02:04:49.975 --> 02:04:55.959]  He went after, like, all the intelligent people and all the wealthy business people who'd supported him first.
[02:04:55.959 --> 02:04:57.500]  Oh, they'll all find out exactly.
[02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:58.621]  These people are complete idiots.
[02:05:01.764 --> 02:05:06.748]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[02:06:01.001 --> 02:06:05.543]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.543 --> 02:06:06.464]  Number one.
[02:06:06.464 --> 02:06:09.886]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.886 --> 02:06:10.746]  Number two.
[02:06:10.746 --> 02:06:15.649]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:16.389]  It's true.
[02:06:16.389 --> 02:06:20.932]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.252 --> 02:06:22.073]  Number 3.
[02:06:22.073 --> 02:06:25.656]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.656 --> 02:06:29.580]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:30.380]  Number 4.
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:33.143]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:33.143 --> 02:06:36.826]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.826 --> 02:06:37.607]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.607 --> 02:06:41.751]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.751 --> 02:06:46.515]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.795 --> 02:06:50.958]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.958 --> 02:06:52.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:55.022]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:07:02.745 --> 02:07:06.706]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:06.706 --> 02:07:15.567]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:15.567 --> 02:07:20.188]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:20.188 --> 02:07:31.010]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:31.650 --> 02:07:41.152]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:41.152 --> 02:07:46.574]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:46.574 --> 02:07:54.075]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:54.075 --> 02:07:56.836]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:02.748 --> 02:08:09.390]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.390 --> 02:08:19.833]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.833 --> 02:08:22.674]  Sean Yu is about to join us via video Skype.
[02:08:22.674 --> 02:08:24.334]  She's a Ugandan-American.
[02:08:24.334 --> 02:08:26.015]  Both parents are from Uganda.
[02:08:27.062 --> 02:08:28.923]  And her YouTube video is Coney2012.
[02:08:28.923 --> 02:08:30.243]  Video is misleading.
[02:08:30.243 --> 02:08:31.804]  Has over 3 million views.
[02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:32.584]  I thought we'd get her on.
[02:08:32.584 --> 02:08:34.764]  We're going to her here in just one moment.
[02:08:34.764 --> 02:08:42.407]  And Patrick Henningsen later is going to ride shotgun with her and I. But it's such big news, I thought I would mention it.
[02:08:43.371 --> 02:08:46.552]  Again, Wired's reporting it.
[02:08:46.552 --> 02:08:58.055]  It's direct public statements he made on a stage that the CIA is surveilling the American people through household appliances, smart meters, iPhones, refrigerators, most of the new ones.
[02:08:58.055 --> 02:09:01.816]  And they're talking about by law, they're going to have an internet connection, the overpower.
[02:09:02.316 --> 02:09:06.421]  Data over power lines, watching you, listening to you.
[02:09:06.421 --> 02:09:13.849]  Even the New York Times is admitting that the smart meters can control all the appliances in your house or pick up data off of them depending on the system.
[02:09:13.849 --> 02:09:15.251]  I mean, it is so incredible.
[02:09:15.251 --> 02:09:16.492]  I read his quotes last hour.
[02:09:17.553 --> 02:09:21.154]  Uh, where he just says, I mean, this is just the total end of everything.
[02:09:21.154 --> 02:09:25.595]  The TSA sticking their hands down our pants, no personal privacy, no Fourth Amendment.
[02:09:25.595 --> 02:09:30.636]  The CIA is operating domestically totally illegally, just saying, yeah, we're spying on you.
[02:09:30.636 --> 02:09:35.337]  Uh, and we're going to launch wars under UN order and, uh, America's done.
[02:09:35.337 --> 02:09:40.939]  And now they're saying, yeah, if Obama gets reelected, they may just go ahead and ban guns through an executive order.
[02:09:40.939 --> 02:09:43.439]  I mean, that, and the NRA's warning that that's going to happen.
[02:09:43.439 --> 02:09:46.140]  I mean, it's, and I used to think they could never move this quick.
[02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:46.620]  They'll do it.
[02:09:48.041 --> 02:09:54.166]  I mean, this is a group of crooks operating out in the open in front of everybody.
[02:09:54.166 --> 02:09:58.450]  And they're so over the top that it flummoxes a lot of people.
[02:09:58.450 --> 02:10:01.493]  Even myself, I'm like, I can't believe this.
[02:10:01.493 --> 02:10:02.594]  Now, I told you it was coming.
[02:10:03.533 --> 02:10:10.840]  Kony 2012, State Department, Hillary Clinton, Samantha Powers, I've got documents linked and videos we've done.
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:16.065]  The latest one that's got heavy documentation is secrets Kony 2012 is desperate to hide.
[02:10:16.065 --> 02:10:16.906]  Get it out.
[02:10:16.906 --> 02:10:20.870]  And what I thought a week and a half ago has been proven correct in spades.
[02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:21.450]  In triplicate.
[02:10:22.222 --> 02:10:23.422]  In fact, worse than I thought.
[02:10:23.422 --> 02:10:25.083]  In fact, I'm actually wrong.
[02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:27.483]  I can't say I predicted it because it's worse than I said.
[02:10:27.483 --> 02:10:30.524]  It is total propaganda for a boogeyman.
[02:10:30.524 --> 02:10:33.625]  You can just move around and they're saying, well, not just Kony.
[02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:38.186]  The resolution in the House says anybody that we say is hurting civilians.
[02:10:38.186 --> 02:10:39.747]  The West doesn't care about civilians.
[02:10:39.747 --> 02:10:44.208]  In fact, State Department memorandum says they want them dead.
[02:10:44.208 --> 02:10:45.348]  State Department memorandum 200.
[02:10:45.348 --> 02:10:46.409]  Henry Kissinger, look it up.
[02:10:46.409 --> 02:10:48.269]  It's in our film.
[02:10:48.269 --> 02:10:50.670]  The 10-minute piece, The Secrets of Kony 2012.
[02:10:53.177 --> 02:10:54.398]  It is so diabolical.
[02:10:54.398 --> 02:10:56.819]  So it's just this, hey, here's the bad man.
[02:10:56.819 --> 02:11:00.800]  Here's the bad man at a Sesame Street three-year-old level.
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:05.042]  They even talk to the adults in the video like, who is the bad man?
[02:11:05.042 --> 02:11:06.523]  That's the bad man.
[02:11:06.523 --> 02:11:11.485]  Now call us and book a screening and dance around in front of people.
[02:11:11.485 --> 02:11:17.068]  And then you find out it's all White House run and they have Clooney getting arrested at the Sudanese
[02:11:18.473 --> 02:11:25.076]  Embassy today, old president, you know, help the people of the humanitarian mission like Libya.
[02:11:25.076 --> 02:11:30.558]  Bomb the country, have the Arabs come in and line the black Libyans up and shoot them, 40,000 dead.
[02:11:30.558 --> 02:11:31.919]  This is not debated now.
[02:11:31.919 --> 02:11:37.721]  We broke it here with people like Dr. Tarpley that went there and risked his life and was in bombardments.
[02:11:37.721 --> 02:11:39.682]  Bombs went off, you know, a quarter mile from him.
[02:11:40.529 --> 02:11:44.250]  He went through checkpoints, you know, saw tracers shooting by his car.
[02:11:44.250 --> 02:11:46.531]  He's the type that doesn't like to talk about it, but I've talked to him privately.
[02:11:46.531 --> 02:11:51.792]  I mean, he was there when his phone would be knocked out while he was on the air via cell phone.
[02:11:51.792 --> 02:11:53.492]  And it was total carnage.
[02:11:53.492 --> 02:11:58.634]  So the new war is launched by a bunch of liberal trendies.
[02:11:58.634 --> 02:12:03.035]  No more WMDs, we gotta go to Iraq, or Saddam throwing babies out of incubators.
[02:12:03.035 --> 02:12:06.176]  Now, it's, oh, we're gonna save Africa.
[02:12:07.079 --> 02:12:19.885]  When the Ugandan president's been connected to all these problems, nobody's seen Connie in years, this young lady has really articulated as a Ugandan what's really going on.
[02:12:19.885 --> 02:12:20.945]  And it's not just her.
[02:12:20.945 --> 02:12:29.169]  Thousands of Ugandans, Americans, who happen to be of Ugandan descent, Ugandans in Uganda, the few that have internet access, they're having showings.
[02:12:29.169 --> 02:12:33.651]  In fact, show that London Telegraph article, where they show it and the people riot!
[02:12:33.651 --> 02:12:34.472]  It's such bull!
[02:12:35.871 --> 02:12:45.056]  And then you learn that Bono, who's involved in all this, gives 1% of the money for his African charity, or 1.5, to Africans with strings attached.
[02:12:45.056 --> 02:12:47.237]  You learn Bill and Melinda Gates are running scams.
[02:12:47.237 --> 02:12:50.179]  You learn this group only gives a little bit of the money.
[02:12:50.179 --> 02:12:51.359]  It is so outrageous.
[02:12:51.359 --> 02:12:58.944]  So I wanted to bring her up here in the aftermath of her video, just one version getting over 3 million views, to
[02:13:00.168 --> 02:13:01.389]  to go over this.
[02:13:01.389 --> 02:13:07.614]  Now the Ugandan government has now halted the screenings because it makes Ugandans so angry.
[02:13:07.614 --> 02:13:13.878]  So it's not just this young lady who the pro-Kony 2012 propagandist out there savaged.
[02:13:13.878 --> 02:13:15.299]  She put her video out a week ago.
[02:13:15.299 --> 02:13:16.881]  She's been proven absolutely right.
[02:13:17.955 --> 02:13:19.536]  So she joins us.
[02:13:19.536 --> 02:13:22.777]  Sanyu, thank you so much for joining us here today.
[02:13:22.777 --> 02:13:23.898]  You've got the floor.
[02:13:23.898 --> 02:13:33.021]  Tell folks the truth of what's happened, and now in hindsight, the video you put out a week ago, what we've learned.
[02:13:33.021 --> 02:13:33.862]  Hi.
[02:13:33.862 --> 02:13:35.402]  Hi.
[02:13:35.402 --> 02:13:41.685]  The video that I actually made was originally for students at my high school.
[02:13:41.685 --> 02:13:43.306]  I'm here in high school right now.
[02:13:44.862 --> 02:13:56.166]  And what they were getting from that Kony 2012 video was that there was a war and that we had to stop the war in Uganda and help these Ugandans.
[02:13:56.166 --> 02:13:58.247]  And I was like, what?
[02:14:01.001 --> 02:14:10.126]  And so I see on Twitter when they have the most trending topics, and Uganda was one of them, and then Kony.
[02:14:10.126 --> 02:14:15.569]  And in the video, I mainly talk about how this isn't affecting Uganda right now.
[02:14:15.569 --> 02:14:17.190]  We're actually moving on from that.
[02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:18.631]  We have moved on from that.
[02:14:18.631 --> 02:14:22.793]  And I know that a lot of people are like, oh, well, the LRA has moved to other places.
[02:14:23.433 --> 02:14:26.214]  But that is not what the video focused on.
[02:14:26.214 --> 02:14:37.136]  It focused mainly on Uganda, which really, really upset me, because every time that I go and I visit, I go to all different parts.
[02:14:37.136 --> 02:14:38.956]  I have a grandmother that lives in the city.
[02:14:38.956 --> 02:14:42.097]  I have my other grandmother who lives in the villages.
[02:14:42.097 --> 02:14:44.757]  And I get the best of both worlds when I go there.
[02:14:44.757 --> 02:14:51.779]  And every single time that I've gone there, I've never, ever had to, like, deal with this Kony drama.
[02:14:54.551 --> 02:14:58.935]  Well, a lot of Ugandans have pointed out that he hasn't been seen in close to six years.
[02:14:58.935 --> 02:15:00.197]  And this U.S.
[02:15:00.197 --> 02:15:09.847]  resolution just says, Kony, anybody that helps him, or anybody we say is hurting civilians, it gives AFRICOM this excuse just to go into any country it wants.
[02:15:10.658 --> 02:15:11.338]  Exactly.
[02:15:11.338 --> 02:15:20.562]  A lot of people don't know about AFRICOM and how it's not only going to affect Uganda, it's going to affect all countries of Africa.
[02:15:20.562 --> 02:15:27.085]  And my mom does not have the conversation about Kony with me because she really believes that Kony is dead.
[02:15:28.135 --> 02:15:28.836]  Every single time.
[02:15:28.836 --> 02:15:32.239]  I'll just be like, Mom, what do you think about the Kony 2012?
[02:15:32.239 --> 02:15:33.239]  Uh-uh.
[02:15:33.239 --> 02:15:34.500]  Kony is dead.
[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:36.042]  And that's all she says.
[02:15:36.042 --> 02:15:44.129]  And if he hasn't been active for that long, and there are reports that Bush bombed his last known location, it kind of makes sense.
[02:15:44.129 --> 02:15:50.214]  I mean, the LRA can move and expand and do whatever they do without having Kony in charge.
[02:15:50.774 --> 02:15:52.555]  Well, now they're saying it isn't about Kony.
[02:15:52.555 --> 02:15:57.959]  They just wanted to draw attention to him, but they're like, first there was Hitler, then there was Bin Laden, now there's Kony.
[02:15:57.959 --> 02:16:09.167]  But don't worry, the UN's gonna get all these Konys, and there just so happens to be one in every country where they want to bring in military force, and we've seen what Western military's done in Africa there.
[02:16:09.167 --> 02:16:10.208]  What's your view on that?
[02:16:10.208 --> 02:16:16.813]  I mean, do you agree with my assessment that this is a pretext to just start invading African countries, backing up dictators and others?
[02:16:17.705 --> 02:16:18.606]  I do believe that.
[02:16:18.606 --> 02:16:24.451]  I do know how horrible President Museveni is and I also do know that he is an ally to the U.S.
[02:16:24.451 --> 02:16:27.434]  government.
[02:16:27.434 --> 02:16:37.663]  I also believe that the fact that they just discovered a lot of oil in Uganda on the border of the Congo as well is very appealing to the U.S.
[02:16:37.663 --> 02:16:41.827]  and how they're not happy with them trading with China.
[02:16:41.827 --> 02:16:42.567]  I just feel like
[02:16:43.208 --> 02:16:43.688]  The U.S.
[02:16:43.688 --> 02:16:45.870]  always has to put their hands on everything.
[02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:52.495]  If the Ugandan government and the Sudanese government and others surrounding Kenya, they can all help out.
[02:16:52.495 --> 02:16:56.498]  And if they wanted to stop these things, they could stop them on their own.
[02:16:56.498 --> 02:16:59.241]  But all these governments are corrupt on their own.
[02:16:59.241 --> 02:17:03.684]  And to have America come in and act as the superhero, they can't.
[02:17:03.684 --> 02:17:05.866]  Because our own government isn't even that stable.
[02:17:06.311 --> 02:17:08.632]  Well, look at our supposed government.
[02:17:08.632 --> 02:17:13.956]  I mean, anybody that thinks they launched the war in Iraq because Iraq was involved in 9-11 needs their head examined.
[02:17:13.956 --> 02:17:17.558]  Anybody that thinks they went into Libya to help people.
[02:17:17.558 --> 02:17:23.662]  I mean, Obama says that was a peace war and that that was humanitarian action.
[02:17:23.662 --> 02:17:31.347]  And I know that most African countries, and I've seen the polls, no Africans I know are buying that, that that was actually to help Libya.
[02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:33.009]  Exactly.
[02:17:33.009 --> 02:17:42.031]  I don't think it was either and I don't think that this video that they put up is really bettering Africa in any way.
[02:17:42.031 --> 02:17:45.592]  It belittles Africa to me actually.
[02:17:45.592 --> 02:17:50.793]  Why do you think people are rioting all over Uganda when they see this film and demanding it not be shown?
[02:17:50.793 --> 02:17:58.735]  Even tribes that aren't associated with groups that Kony was in the north and the government's now saying they don't want it shown in the country.
[02:17:58.735 --> 02:17:59.435]  I think because
[02:18:01.257 --> 02:18:02.598]  That's a good question.
[02:18:02.598 --> 02:18:16.129]  I think the reason why they don't want it shown is also they don't want these outsiders coming in and thinking that they have a really big outlook on Uganda and through other surrounding countries because of this video.
[02:18:16.129 --> 02:18:16.929]  That's not it.
[02:18:16.929 --> 02:18:22.194]  Like, you can't form a relationship with Africa because of this one YouTube video.
[02:18:22.194 --> 02:18:24.515]  And I think that that is what's angering, especially for
[02:18:26.256 --> 02:18:51.347]  a place in the world that has such a little technology interaction and the fact that you have all these people wearing these t-shirts buying these bracelets like you don't know the roots of Africa you don't know the history thoroughly of Africa and what has gone on with like Idi Amin and you don't know like what President Museveni is doing like other problems that they are going through
[02:18:51.727 --> 02:18:58.792]  And I know you've got family there, so you probably don't want to say too much about him, but we've had experts like Dr. Tarpley, whose research hadn't been there.
[02:18:58.792 --> 02:19:05.658]  Estimates are that president is connected to groups and organizations that himself, in the last 26 years, 7 million dead.
[02:19:05.658 --> 02:19:10.361]  And they're talking about Kony, who is, like, microscopic compared to that?
[02:19:10.361 --> 02:19:11.062]  Exactly.
[02:19:11.062 --> 02:19:20.990]  And what got to me was the fact that Kony had child soldiers after President Museveni did.
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:27.968]  And so I was like, you're acting like he's the only man in this world who has done this.
[02:19:27.968 --> 02:19:37.640]  And the fact that they advertise him as the world's worst war criminal is just so, it's so humoring to me.
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:39.102]  Like I just, I think it's funny.
[02:19:40.562 --> 02:19:48.191]  Well, it is funny until you realize that these fake liberals prancing around are really war propagandists trying to sell Americans on getting behind new wars.
[02:19:48.191 --> 02:19:53.637]  Because Americans do want to help Africa on average, so they have trendies dance around and say, we're going to help Africa.
[02:19:53.637 --> 02:19:56.279]  People will get behind it, so it's dangerous.
[02:19:56.279 --> 02:19:57.941]  Stay there, Sanyu.
[02:19:57.941 --> 02:19:58.842]  Amazing testimony.
[02:19:58.842 --> 02:20:01.105]  I want to come back with you and Patrick Hennigsen straight ahead.
[02:20:01.545 --> 02:20:02.846]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.846 --> 02:20:08.450]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:13.473]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.473 --> 02:20:18.517]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:20:19.037 --> 02:20:24.261]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:24.261 --> 02:20:26.582]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:20:26.582 --> 02:20:31.385]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[02:20:35.548 --> 02:20:39.191]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:56.538]  Spelled L-E-C-I-G.com.
[02:23:56.538 --> 02:23:59.486]  LeCig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[02:24:12.577 --> 02:24:23.524]  Patrick Henningsen, investigative journalist at Infowars.com, reporter, is also in studio with us, and he'll go a little bit in the next hour with us riding shotgun.
[02:24:23.524 --> 02:24:26.466]  Sanyu is a high school student here in America.
[02:24:26.466 --> 02:24:29.428]  Both her parents are from Uganda.
[02:24:29.428 --> 02:24:36.132]  She visits Uganda, has her grandparents there, and the Ugandans everywhere are freaking out when they see this coming 2012.
[02:24:37.233 --> 02:24:41.694]  And now the Kony Colt people are saying, I don't care what you say.
[02:24:41.694 --> 02:24:42.855]  I'm liberal.
[02:24:42.855 --> 02:24:43.815]  I'm trendy.
[02:24:43.815 --> 02:24:45.696]  I want military action in Uganda.
[02:24:45.696 --> 02:24:50.437]  I want the AFRICOM to invade these countries.
[02:24:50.437 --> 02:24:53.658]  And so, yes, it's funny at one level that it's so ridiculous, but
[02:24:54.608 --> 02:25:02.051]  It's very dangerous, because they'll tell America that we're over there saving people, and America will get behind carpet bombing the entire continent.
[02:25:02.051 --> 02:25:04.112]  People need to understand, this is dangerous.
[02:25:04.112 --> 02:25:06.433]  The trendies are about as vicious as it gets.
[02:25:06.433 --> 02:25:08.854]  And they're never going to be told they're wrong.
[02:25:08.854 --> 02:25:13.456]  They're going to call for probably napalming the entire continent now, just because people are telling them they don't like it.
[02:25:13.456 --> 02:25:14.597]  They're like, you don't like it?
[02:25:14.597 --> 02:25:18.019]  Here's some napalm, Sonyu.
[02:25:18.019 --> 02:25:20.660]  Other points you'd like to add joining us from your high school today?
[02:25:24.011 --> 02:25:38.130]  Really it's just I have gotten obviously like a lot of negative response for these videos and people are judging me saying that I don't care about these kids and I'm like people need to realize
[02:25:40.012 --> 02:25:44.317]  When they're talking about the LRA, they're talking about the children that they want to save.
[02:25:44.317 --> 02:25:52.566]  And when there's military intervention, those lives of those child soldiers that have been taken are going to be lost.
[02:25:52.566 --> 02:25:56.611]  And I think that a lot of people really need to open their eyes up and realize that.
[02:25:58.288 --> 02:26:02.672]  Well, plus, I mean, that's going on in every culture throughout history.
[02:26:02.672 --> 02:26:04.754]  Sometimes there's been pressing of children into service.
[02:26:04.754 --> 02:26:05.614]  I'm not saying it's good.
[02:26:05.614 --> 02:26:06.515]  It's terrible.
[02:26:06.515 --> 02:26:07.856]  Kony, I think, is a bad guy.
[02:26:07.856 --> 02:26:12.400]  But, again, you notice they always pick somebody like Bin Laden, who hadn't been seen in years.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:13.781]  It's a perfect boogeyman.
[02:26:13.781 --> 02:26:15.162]  Like, he might be under the table.
[02:26:15.162 --> 02:26:16.604]  He might be in the closet.
[02:26:16.604 --> 02:26:21.068]  He, you know, he might be... Maybe Kony's hiding there at your high school.
[02:26:21.068 --> 02:26:24.551]  I actually, like...
[02:26:26.417 --> 02:26:28.559]  I just, I don't know, it's just so weird.
[02:26:28.559 --> 02:26:38.085]  It's the fact that if he's hiding somewhere, I do not believe that he has enough money to, you know, have a nice house to stay somewhere.
[02:26:38.085 --> 02:26:44.930]  Like, he is probably somewhere in a jungle, in like a hut or something.
[02:26:44.930 --> 02:26:52.335]  Like, I don't think that people... But if, but if, but if AFRICOM invades all the countries, that'll get him though.
[02:26:52.335 --> 02:26:53.556]  It's not going to get him.
[02:26:54.172 --> 02:26:58.014]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:26:58.014 --> 02:27:01.636]  You got over 90% support on one of your videos.
[02:27:01.636 --> 02:27:02.817]  It got over 3 million views.
[02:27:02.817 --> 02:27:09.421]  So most people are seeing through this, but what type of hate has been thrown at you by the Trendies?
[02:27:09.421 --> 02:27:22.169]  Well, obviously I can tell that they're a bunch of really young people or even the people that are just so... My voice really needs to be heard and through this it can be heard and I can make a difference in the world and everyone is just like...
[02:27:23.148 --> 02:27:24.329]  I don't think so.
[02:27:38.649 --> 02:27:39.189]  Got me.
[02:27:39.189 --> 02:27:44.333]  What was kind of confusing was someone was like, you are so ungrateful.
[02:27:44.333 --> 02:27:55.600]  Our country helps so many savages like you and just because we want to help out your savage country and save all the savages in that country, you want to get mad.
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:56.281]  And I was like...
[02:27:56.801 --> 02:27:57.723]  Wow, wow.
[02:27:57.723 --> 02:27:59.726]  Patrick Henningsen, investigative journalist, is in here.
[02:27:59.726 --> 02:28:00.888]  You want to comment on this?
[02:28:00.888 --> 02:28:01.208]  I don't know.
[02:28:01.208 --> 02:28:11.865]  When I hear stuff like this from Sonia, it really gets me fired up, Alex, because it's the classical Orientalist view that Westerners have been trained over 200 years to look at places like Africa.
[02:28:12.305 --> 02:28:18.910]  And carrying the white man's burden, we're going to come in and we're going to save the Africans, we're going to save the Afghans.
[02:28:18.910 --> 02:28:37.125]  You know, all the liberals who are backing Kony 2012, if you're listening now, just be aware, okay, that the agenda for Uganda and the rest of Africa was signed, sealed, and delivered in 2007 by George Bush Jr., okay, and every liberal hates George Bush Jr., but he, that's why he's endorsing Kony 2012!
[02:28:37.825 --> 02:28:41.246]  Well, he put AFRICOM into motion in 2007.
[02:28:41.246 --> 02:28:50.789]  AFRICOM, if the African Central Command objective is a child of the project of a new American century, it's the stepchild of that.
[02:28:50.789 --> 02:28:54.090]  You have CENTCOM in Qatar, you have AFRICOM in Africa.
[02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:59.416]  And you have these organizations, they sprout out of the... It's a globalist invasion.
[02:28:59.416 --> 02:29:00.458]  You've got all the documents.
[02:29:00.458 --> 02:29:02.941]  We're going to go over those when we come back from break.
[02:29:02.941 --> 02:29:05.685]  But going back to our guest who's joining us from her high school.
[02:29:05.685 --> 02:29:08.629]  You know, I'm really glad that your high school let you do this today.
[02:29:08.629 --> 02:29:09.671]  And I appreciate you coming on.
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:14.602]  Yeah, they really support what I had to say.
[02:29:14.602 --> 02:29:20.844]  Especially my world history teacher, and my government teacher, and even my arts teacher.
[02:29:20.844 --> 02:29:24.185]  Everyone has been really supportive at my school, so I'm really grateful for that.
[02:29:24.185 --> 02:29:28.407]  Yeah, so you're finding most people there, they're not buying the Kony Bowl?
[02:29:28.407 --> 02:29:30.368]  They did until I made my video.
[02:29:31.107 --> 02:29:31.868]  Well, that's good, though.
[02:29:31.868 --> 02:29:35.971]  See, they were well-meaning, and then you're there and going, hey, I go to Uganda.
[02:29:35.971 --> 02:29:37.112]  People aren't buying this.
[02:29:37.112 --> 02:29:39.513]  And then now, a week later, you've been proven right.
[02:29:39.513 --> 02:29:42.215]  The government's like, don't show this movie anymore.
[02:29:42.215 --> 02:29:44.157]  People really are getting angry.
[02:29:44.157 --> 02:29:44.497]  Stay there.
[02:29:44.497 --> 02:29:46.178]  We'll do about 10 more minutes with you.
[02:29:46.178 --> 02:29:47.599]  Patrick Henningsen's with us.
[02:29:47.599 --> 02:29:48.780]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:50.682]  You're getting what's really happening right now.
[02:29:50.682 --> 02:29:52.083]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.083 --> 02:29:54.605]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.605 --> 02:29:57.287]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.804 --> 02:30:02.864]  I had tried everything.
[02:30:02.864 --> 02:30:05.225]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:30:05.225 --> 02:30:08.346]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:30:08.346 --> 02:30:13.188]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[02:30:13.188 --> 02:30:20.031]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:30:20.031 --> 02:30:30.495]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:30:31.255 --> 02:30:35.717]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:30:35.717 --> 02:30:41.979]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:30:41.979 --> 02:30:43.559]  Now that's results.
[02:30:43.559 --> 02:30:50.341]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[02:30:50.341 --> 02:30:56.063]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[02:30:56.063 --> 02:30:58.604]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[02:30:58.604 --> 02:31:00.225]  Infowarsteam.com.
[02:31:01.308 --> 02:31:02.629]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:02.629 --> 02:31:08.211]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:08.211 --> 02:31:13.233]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:13.233 --> 02:31:18.255]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:31:18.795 --> 02:31:24.019]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:31:24.019 --> 02:31:26.341]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:31:26.341 --> 02:31:31.145]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:31.145 --> 02:31:32.266]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:32.266 --> 02:31:35.328]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:31:35.328 --> 02:31:38.611]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:38.931 --> 02:31:42.112]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:42.112 --> 02:31:44.353]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:44.353 --> 02:31:45.134]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:45.134 --> 02:31:45.434]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:45.434 --> 02:31:48.915]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:48.915 --> 02:31:50.656]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:01.539 --> 02:32:06.543]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[02:32:06.543 --> 02:32:19.052]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.
[02:32:19.052 --> 02:32:21.474]  eFoods Direct Family Packs are the answer.

[02:32:25.077 --> 02:32:25.397]  I think so.
[02:32:48.959 --> 02:32:54.662]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:32:54.662 --> 02:33:02.527]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:33:02.527 --> 02:33:08.570]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:08.570 --> 02:33:11.132]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:12.398 --> 02:33:16.359]  All right, Sanyu is joining us from her high school.
[02:33:16.359 --> 02:33:21.781]  We won't give you her last name or where she's at for her own privacy.
[02:33:21.781 --> 02:33:28.662]  But she had the courage a little over a week ago to say, hey, this whole Kony 12 thing, I've got family there.
[02:33:28.662 --> 02:33:29.583]  My parents are from there.
[02:33:29.583 --> 02:33:30.023]  I visit.
[02:33:31.047 --> 02:33:33.469]  He's not even been an issue for many years.
[02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:35.050]  Something's going on here.
[02:33:35.050 --> 02:33:38.313]  And she got overwhelming support, but some still attacked her.
[02:33:38.313 --> 02:33:41.776]  Now, since then, you know, a lot has developed.
[02:33:41.776 --> 02:33:44.037]  Our worst fears about this have been proven true.
[02:33:44.037 --> 02:33:48.521]  It's a total CIA front, invasion force plan.
[02:33:48.521 --> 02:33:52.825]  Patrick was just making the point during the break, it's like the last days of Hitler, the Hitler youth.
[02:33:52.825 --> 02:33:55.306]  When the propagandists start targeting high school kids,
[02:33:56.249 --> 02:33:57.450]  You know you're in trouble.
[02:33:57.450 --> 02:34:00.672]  I mean, the system is now trying to see if they can get kids hyping war.
[02:34:00.672 --> 02:34:20.166]  You know, go to your parents, tell them, call for an invasion, a peace war like Libya, and then you find out that's their whole program, this is their new push, they got George Clooney running around, Angelina Jolie, you know, just in five minutes or so, because I know you've got to get back to class there, points you'd like to make to the world now, you know, since you originally put that video out.
[02:34:22.109 --> 02:34:24.991]  A couple points that I do have to put out.
[02:34:24.991 --> 02:34:30.174]  Through that video, some people thought that maybe I wasn't in favor of Kony getting justice.
[02:34:30.174 --> 02:34:32.235]  Yes, I do think he's a horrible man.
[02:34:32.235 --> 02:34:42.702]  But, like I always say, people really do need to do their own research, not just base it off of this one video that they saw through great editing and effects.
[02:34:44.351 --> 02:34:49.833]  I don't believe that they needed to exaggerate what they did in that video.
[02:34:49.833 --> 02:34:53.234]  And the footage that they used was outdated.
[02:34:53.234 --> 02:35:03.217]  And I just really, I just educate people like, just educate yourselves and research.
[02:35:03.217 --> 02:35:04.178]  Do your own research.
[02:35:04.178 --> 02:35:07.819]  Maybe you'll find something that I may not know and you can come to me and tell me that.
[02:35:10.322 --> 02:35:11.103]  Very well said.
[02:35:11.103 --> 02:35:12.364]  I see somebody's trying to talk to you.
[02:35:12.364 --> 02:35:13.045]  Is that your teacher?
[02:35:13.045 --> 02:35:14.326]  Yeah.
[02:35:14.326 --> 02:35:16.028]  Well, go ahead and talk to your teacher for a moment.
[02:35:16.028 --> 02:35:20.192]  Go ahead.
[02:35:20.192 --> 02:35:22.254]  Or if you don't need to speak to her, that's okay.
[02:35:22.254 --> 02:35:26.358]  You can leave her up just so I know.
[02:35:26.358 --> 02:35:27.659]  Okay, great.
[02:35:27.659 --> 02:35:32.003]  Well, we just appreciate your courage.
[02:35:32.003 --> 02:35:33.224]  We just appreciate your courage.
[02:35:33.224 --> 02:35:33.745]  Yes, you're on air.
[02:35:37.898 --> 02:35:39.340]  Okay, her video broke up.
[02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:40.181]  Alright.
[02:35:40.181 --> 02:35:46.108]  Sanyu, can you hear me?
[02:35:46.108 --> 02:35:46.789]  She's frozen.
[02:35:46.789 --> 02:35:48.030]  Alright, we'll try to...
[02:35:49.332 --> 02:35:52.533]  Sometimes if you reclick it, it'll come right back.
[02:35:52.533 --> 02:35:52.793]  Great.
[02:35:52.793 --> 02:35:53.693]  And then we'll see when we get her.
[02:35:53.693 --> 02:35:55.674]  Wow.
[02:35:55.674 --> 02:35:59.294]  Patrick, you have this whole presentation ready for this hour and they have to book her right during that time.
[02:35:59.294 --> 02:36:01.615]  But you are going to come in and expose Kony.
[02:36:01.615 --> 02:36:02.835]  You've got all the documents there.
[02:36:02.835 --> 02:36:04.556]  I mean, this is an open and shut.
[02:36:04.556 --> 02:36:09.777]  And it's so creepy to see them now literally going with the 1984 paradigm of war is peace.
[02:36:10.973 --> 02:36:15.995]  Yeah, the Kony issue actually goes right back to 1987, okay?
[02:36:15.995 --> 02:36:19.496]  This guy's been running around the jungles of Uganda in 1987.
[02:36:19.496 --> 02:36:25.698]  Okay, let's take a logical, deductive, logic sort of view of things.
[02:36:25.698 --> 02:36:31.280]  You've got a resistance army, a guerrilla army, hiding in the jungles of Uganda, okay?
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:32.901]  This sounds very familiar.
[02:36:32.901 --> 02:36:37.843]  We've seen this in Central America, we've seen this in other African countries all over the planet.
[02:36:38.283 --> 02:36:51.551]  There is a slight possibility, and I would actually wager money on it, Alex, that the Lord's Resistance Army has links to either the CIA or the MI6 or the Mossad or something like this, okay?
[02:36:51.551 --> 02:36:53.612]  It's not out of the realms of possibility.
[02:36:53.612 --> 02:36:56.734]  And I know people are going to say, oh my God, how can you say such a thing?
[02:36:56.734 --> 02:36:58.775]  Well, history is my guide.
[02:36:58.775 --> 02:37:00.156]  Well, that's actually been flagged now.
[02:37:00.156 --> 02:37:01.537]  There are some connections.
[02:37:01.897 --> 02:37:07.219]  Yeah, if there's even a remote connection, Alex, you know that the whole thing is absolutely filthy, okay?
[02:37:07.219 --> 02:37:09.399]  Well, they always finance both sides.
[02:37:09.399 --> 02:37:14.341]  What Mussolini did, he did a deal with Obama, okay, in 2009.
[02:37:14.341 --> 02:37:19.022]  He said, well, I'm going to help you fight Muslim extremists in Somalia.
[02:37:19.022 --> 02:37:21.323]  Mussolini is the president for life in Uganda.
[02:37:21.323 --> 02:37:24.084]  He's more or less a dictator in those terms.
[02:37:24.084 --> 02:37:27.285]  He said, I'm going to help you fight the Muslim extremists or the Al-Qaeda.
[02:37:28.814 --> 02:37:45.599]  I'm gonna help you fight them in Somalia and the reward Uganda got for that is 45 million dollars of military equipment which was delivered in 2010 and 2011 so the deal between the US State Department and the Ugandan dictator has been going on since Obama
[02:37:46.099 --> 02:37:46.419]  I think?
[02:38:04.634 --> 02:38:11.258]  And we know the State Department plan, who's running all this, is to cut off resources and kill Africans deader than a hammer.
[02:38:11.258 --> 02:38:15.660]  So, it's not just like, oh, they're wanting to run things, they're kicking out some bad guys.
[02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:26.486]  They're just projecting on the ICC website, every country's got a phantom boogie guy who hasn't been seen in a long time, that they're going to invade, but the resolutions say, anybody else we want to kill.
[02:38:26.486 --> 02:38:28.127]  I mean, it's just a license to invade.
[02:38:28.527 --> 02:38:30.908]  And let me tell you, I'm glad this girl came forward, okay?
[02:38:30.908 --> 02:38:34.608]  Because she's speaking from a point of real experience and reality.
[02:38:34.608 --> 02:38:42.470]  I went to an ICC hearing in London near the Houses of Parliament about a year and a half ago, and they were going after the Sudanese president at the time.
[02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:45.831]  So they had a big multi-panel debate on the subject.
[02:38:45.831 --> 02:38:49.332]  And all the Sudanese there were like, how dare you?
[02:38:49.332 --> 02:38:51.593]  How dare you violate our national sovereignty?
[02:38:51.593 --> 02:38:55.113]  You don't think that we can bring our own criminals to justice?
[02:38:55.113 --> 02:38:57.534]  We don't want a UN or an ICC coming into our
[02:38:57.634 --> 02:38:58.675]  Well, the U.N.
[02:38:58.675 --> 02:39:01.318]  only goes after people that resist them, whether they're good or bad.
[02:39:01.318 --> 02:39:03.641]  They go after some guys that are bad, some that are good.
[02:39:03.641 --> 02:39:07.065]  They go after anybody that doesn't let them rob their country.
[02:39:07.065 --> 02:39:09.868]  It's a question of national sovereignty with the International Criminal Court.
[02:39:09.868 --> 02:39:10.849]  That's what it is.
[02:39:10.849 --> 02:39:11.550]  Well, exactly.
[02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:12.191]  The U.N.
[02:39:14.193 --> 02:39:22.424]  That's what this is all about is selling that the ICC is the final arbiter and Obama is saying the Supreme Court justices are saying the ICC is their boss.
[02:39:22.424 --> 02:39:24.106]  They're saying they're the boss over our military.
[02:39:24.106 --> 02:39:25.207]  This is global government.
[02:39:25.207 --> 02:39:27.771]  The kids toys all say UN Force now.
[02:39:27.771 --> 02:39:28.892]  It's no more US Army.
[02:39:30.359 --> 02:39:44.488]  And all the feel-good people on Facebook and Twitter who are backing Kony 2012, be aware that your country, the United States, is one of the only countries in the world that didn't sign up to the bogus ICC criminal court in the first place.
[02:39:44.488 --> 02:39:55.215]  Because if we did, if the United States did sign up to the ICC, Ronald Reagan would have been in the dock for mining the Nicaraguan harbors, and there's a whole litany of crimes.
[02:39:55.215 --> 02:39:57.517]  Well, Iraq's a war crime if there ever was one!
[02:39:57.777 --> 02:40:00.059]  The end, the list is endless, okay?
[02:40:00.059 --> 02:40:05.222]  That's why the United States is not signed up to this global... But then backs it!
[02:40:05.222 --> 02:40:06.763]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[02:40:06.763 --> 02:40:10.526]  I mean, England would be on there, France, I mean, Libya is a war crime.
[02:40:10.526 --> 02:40:14.068]  All of these are classic war crimes, and it's incredible.
[02:40:14.068 --> 02:40:17.311]  Sonia is back, she's there at high school.
[02:40:17.311 --> 02:40:21.574]  Sonia, you were trying to finish, any other points that you'd like to make before you go?
[02:40:23.341 --> 02:40:35.871]  Really I feel like I've said most of everything that I needed to say but I just do think that people should not try and follow into this trend because it's more than just a trend.
[02:40:35.871 --> 02:40:43.857]  Especially that on their website they tell you just to sign your name and your email and these people don't know what they're signing into and it's really
[02:40:45.456 --> 02:40:50.045]  You're supporting military troops getting sent over to Africa.
[02:40:50.045 --> 02:40:53.953]  And for all these peace people are like, no, we don't want more people to die.
[02:40:53.953 --> 02:40:56.638]  This is going to cause more harm than good.
[02:40:57.622 --> 02:41:06.228]  What do you think about the way they talk to, this is targeting high school and college students, they talk to them like at a Sesame Street level in some of these videos, like the Coney movie screening.
[02:41:06.228 --> 02:41:13.212]  People thought I was joking on radio when I went, you know, they're dancing like, ah, ah, oh, send the troops, oh.
[02:41:13.212 --> 02:41:24.420]  They actually are doing that, and it's so, it's like a Monty Python skit, but it's war, but they're all dressed in, you know, pink pastels, you know, with effeminate guys going, get Coney, get Coney.
[02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:27.382]  I mean, it's a, boy, let me tell you, the globalists are getting desperate here.
[02:41:27.922 --> 02:41:29.664]  I mean, this is some sick propaganda.
[02:41:29.664 --> 02:41:30.726]  What did you think about that?
[02:41:30.726 --> 02:41:40.577]  I mean, I don't think Africans, who are on record pretty serious folks, like also the fact that the film looks like it's targeting children and is very mindless.
[02:41:41.676 --> 02:41:42.417]  Yeah it does.
[02:41:42.417 --> 02:41:43.798]  I believe it targets children.
[02:41:43.798 --> 02:41:54.146]  It reminded me of when I was in elementary school and middle school when they would come in and have you like sell things for them and you would make the money but you wouldn't really earn the money.
[02:41:54.146 --> 02:41:59.591]  It would go to them so you'd win a little prize and this is exactly like the same things that they're doing except
[02:42:00.990 --> 02:42:03.312]  They're making money on their own for this.
[02:42:03.312 --> 02:42:06.914]  I think they're connecting by giving you $5 off a t-shirt.
[02:42:06.914 --> 02:42:11.377]  They came to my cousin's high school and she's like, yeah, the t-shirts were like $15.
[02:42:11.377 --> 02:42:14.159]  And I was like, they're more expensive on the website.
[02:42:14.159 --> 02:42:24.165]  But they try and make it seem like you're special and that you have all this power when it's really, yeah, you may do, but you don't know how to use it just yet.
[02:42:24.165 --> 02:42:28.709]  What do you think of Bono, the papers, even the BBC reports, gives about 1.5% of the money
[02:42:31.932 --> 02:42:33.074]  Uh oh, a fire drill.
[02:42:33.074 --> 02:42:34.336]  We better say bye to her.
[02:42:34.336 --> 02:42:39.024]  Oh no, that was actually my cell phone.
[02:42:39.024 --> 02:42:42.930]  What do you make of this whole business of African charities and it turns out it's a total scam?
[02:42:44.159 --> 02:42:48.401]  Well, it is, like 1.5% you said, that's nothing.
[02:42:48.401 --> 02:42:50.062]  A little less than that, yeah.
[02:42:50.062 --> 02:42:53.904]  That's nothing, like how they donate 30%, that's nothing.
[02:42:53.904 --> 02:43:02.348]  I looked into like Feed My Starving Children, and they donate 93% of the proceeds, and only 7% goes to fundraising and advertising.
[02:43:02.348 --> 02:43:04.749]  That's right, plug, there are groups that give over 90%, plug them right now.
[02:43:06.232 --> 02:43:15.757]  And like, well, I know for sure that, um, Feed My Starving Children, there are always those food drives where you could just give food cans and they would give them directly to the people.
[02:43:15.757 --> 02:43:17.958]  Exactly.
[02:43:17.958 --> 02:43:26.522]  It's just, there's so much, there's more than just invisible children, and that's what people get through this YouTube video, and they blind everything else.
[02:43:26.522 --> 02:43:34.786]  Yeah, it's not just, let's just help people with dams and water treatment and seeds, that's what really helps folks, and shovels, or food.
[02:43:35.166 --> 02:43:37.429]  It's, oh, let's have an invasion!
[02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:38.050]  It's liberal!
[02:43:38.050 --> 02:43:41.094]  And you're like, no, this is a State Department-run pro-war plan.
[02:43:41.094 --> 02:43:42.015]  Here's the documents.
[02:43:42.015 --> 02:43:42.496]  Shut up!
[02:43:42.496 --> 02:43:44.719]  You just hate the Africans!
[02:43:44.719 --> 02:43:46.501]  Yeah, that's exactly what they say.
[02:43:48.281 --> 02:43:52.523]  Yeah, you can feel good for posting a Twitter status, but that's not going to change anything.
[02:43:52.523 --> 02:43:59.605]  And you can donate $10 to Invisible Children and there's a 70% chance it's not going to touch those kids.
[02:43:59.605 --> 02:44:01.466]  And what does is going to come with strings.
[02:44:01.466 --> 02:44:02.887]  Final question for you.
[02:44:02.887 --> 02:44:07.869]  I'm sick of Angelina Jolie always there with the starving kids reaching at her for a photo op.
[02:44:07.869 --> 02:44:08.929]  I mean, that is disgusting.
[02:44:09.329 --> 02:44:09.809]  I don't know.
[02:44:39.502 --> 02:44:41.243]  Was that directed towards Sonia?
[02:44:41.243 --> 02:44:44.865]  Yes, yes, yes, Sonia, you.
[02:44:44.865 --> 02:44:46.346]  It doesn't sit well with me.
[02:44:46.346 --> 02:44:48.587]  People don't get it.
[02:44:48.587 --> 02:44:57.192]  You can't just invade someone else's country and think that everyone is going to be happy about it and you're going to say you're coming for peace with a big gun in your hand.
[02:44:57.192 --> 02:44:57.632]  No.
[02:44:57.632 --> 02:44:59.754]  You're going to scare innocent people.
[02:44:59.754 --> 02:45:02.395]  Innocent people are going to react not in a good way.
[02:45:04.747 --> 02:45:11.113]  Like I said, it's just going to, it's going to add up and it's not going to add up well and it's not going to end well.
[02:45:11.113 --> 02:45:11.613]  You're right.
[02:45:11.613 --> 02:45:15.057]  Well listen, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:45:15.057 --> 02:45:22.604]  Give folks your YouTube channel or any other ways media can contact you if they want to actually hear what you have to say instead of what the Kony minions are saying.
[02:45:23.297 --> 02:45:25.138]  Okay, thanks.
[02:45:25.138 --> 02:45:29.819]  You can just look at my YouTube channel, Son You Said It.
[02:45:29.819 --> 02:45:40.262]  My Kony video is like the second video right under the first phony Kony video that Invisible Children made, so if you want to find me, you can message me through there and we can talk further.
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:43.101]  Alright, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:45:43.101 --> 02:45:45.162]  Thank you, take care.
[02:45:45.162 --> 02:45:48.964]  What an amazing young lady, and people are waking up.
[02:45:48.964 --> 02:45:49.925]  You're chomping at the bit.
[02:45:49.925 --> 02:45:51.586]  You've got the floor, Patrick.
[02:45:51.586 --> 02:45:58.830]  Look, the Kony 2012 campaign, this is the ultimate act of desperation, okay?
[02:45:58.830 --> 02:46:01.071]  What they're doing is, when you have to employ children,
[02:46:01.551 --> 02:46:04.873]  When you have to put children as troops on the field, okay?
[02:46:04.873 --> 02:46:08.154]  Like the last days of Berlin, right before the Reich fell.
[02:46:08.154 --> 02:46:11.416]  The last people out, all the other soldiers had already high-tailed it out.
[02:46:11.416 --> 02:46:12.556]  They saw the Russians coming in.
[02:46:12.556 --> 02:46:13.417]  Who was left?
[02:46:13.417 --> 02:46:14.497]  The kids were left.
[02:46:14.497 --> 02:46:18.019]  The kids and a few hardcore people hanging deserters, okay?
[02:46:18.019 --> 02:46:24.562]  This really sad, sad sort of point when you get to, and for instance, Stalingrad, they're dead.
[02:46:24.562 --> 02:46:27.524]  Nobody left to run the front line, so they had to get the 13, 14 year olds up.
[02:46:28.684 --> 02:46:30.545]  Throw a gun in their hand.
[02:46:30.545 --> 02:46:32.406]  This is not much different than that, Alex.
[02:46:32.406 --> 02:46:35.168]  This is looking at our civilization.
[02:46:35.168 --> 02:46:43.353]  Our politicians can no longer sell these bogus proxy wars, these foundation-funded Trojan Horses interventions.
[02:46:43.353 --> 02:46:52.878]  Look, the new system, Alex, the CIA shell company system that worked in the 50s and 60s and 70s and 80s, that's obsolete now.
[02:46:52.878 --> 02:46:55.340]  Now they've replaced that with a foundation-funded
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:47:01.383]  Propaganda, Trojan horses, NGOs, and these sort of feel-good campaigns like this.
[02:47:01.383 --> 02:47:08.207]  I'm sure that our friends from the Soros Foundations and the Ford, the National Democracy, etc.
[02:47:08.207 --> 02:47:10.328]  They've probably got their hands in the Coney 20.
[02:47:10.328 --> 02:47:11.208]  No, we've done the research.
[02:47:11.208 --> 02:47:11.589]  They do.
[02:47:11.589 --> 02:47:12.629]  State Department, everything.
[02:47:12.629 --> 02:47:16.171]  And, you know, I didn't even see that, Alex, and I could just make an educated guess.
[02:47:16.171 --> 02:47:23.395]  I can walk into the New World Order casino, and I can lay bets down, and I can, I'm just winning, winning, winning, without even seeing
[02:47:23.955 --> 02:47:27.358]  Because you don't even need to see the documentation.
[02:47:27.358 --> 02:47:29.360]  I was speaking to Kurt Nimmo earlier.
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:42.831]  We found some women's organization in Morocco who's opposing this new rape thing and they're all going crazy in Morocco over this incident of this woman who committed suicide because she was forced to marry a rapist, okay?
[02:47:42.831 --> 02:47:46.754]  National League of Democratic Women or something like that in Morocco.
[02:47:46.754 --> 02:47:51.138]  Sure enough, there's a foundation connection which traces back to America, okay?
[02:47:51.138 --> 02:47:52.339]  I didn't even need to see the link.
[02:47:52.739 --> 02:47:55.183]  And it's not going to end up helping women.
[02:47:55.183 --> 02:48:01.011]  It's just some type of background thing to make folks mad at Muslims so when they blow up Iran, well, they deserved it.
[02:48:01.011 --> 02:48:06.940]  The tear-jerking point in the Middle East and Central Asia is women.
[02:48:06.940 --> 02:48:08.202]  Look how they treat their women.
[02:48:08.542 --> 02:48:10.023]  And in Africa, it's going to be children.
[02:48:10.023 --> 02:48:11.004]  Exactly.
[02:48:11.004 --> 02:48:12.525]  And better than children, Alex.
[02:48:12.525 --> 02:48:22.972]  Through the 80s, from Live Aid, from 1984-85, and Save the Children, and all these UNICEF commercials that we've had a steady diet of for about 30 years.
[02:48:22.972 --> 02:48:24.152]  That's the cover for the U.N.
[02:48:24.152 --> 02:48:25.033]  slaughtering everybody.
[02:48:25.253 --> 02:48:27.015]  That's conditioning, Alex.
[02:48:27.015 --> 02:48:29.418]  That's media conditioning of African children.
[02:48:29.418 --> 02:48:35.086]  And now we've got two, three generations who are totally indoctrinated into this image of African children.
[02:48:35.086 --> 02:48:43.477]  You've got Madonna running down, adopting some black baby from... And really, what the UN is, is the new colonial government.
[02:48:43.917 --> 02:48:46.798]  Yeah, this is the new neocolonial government.
[02:48:46.798 --> 02:48:48.178]  Why are they so desperate, Alex?
[02:48:48.178 --> 02:48:48.898]  You're wondering.
[02:48:48.898 --> 02:48:55.200]  When you have to use kids to fast-track a foreign intervention policy, there is a reason behind this.
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:49:00.821]  The reason they're desperate, Alex, okay, is because they are 15 years behind China in Africa.
[02:49:00.821 --> 02:49:10.364]  While we've been diddling around in the Middle East, trying to shore up our geopolitical arc of tension right from Central Asia right around to Europe.
[02:49:10.364 --> 02:49:10.884]  Ukraine, yeah.
[02:49:11.184 --> 02:49:18.492]  We, uh, while they've been diddling around, China has been slowly and steadily, uh, investing actual money, building infrastructure.
[02:49:18.492 --> 02:49:23.298]  They're there with generators and wells, and like, oh, you're not shoving a machine gun in my face?
[02:49:23.298 --> 02:49:25.640]  You're actually here trying to give me a job?
[02:49:26.121 --> 02:49:28.123]  Yeah, what the U.S.
[02:49:28.123 --> 02:49:31.345]  has been doing for the last 40 years is their foreign aid program, okay?
[02:49:31.345 --> 02:49:32.847]  Here's some poison food!
[02:49:32.847 --> 02:49:33.727]  Here's some vaccines!
[02:49:33.727 --> 02:49:36.630]  Yeah, the foreign aid, or food aid, military aid, whatever it is.
[02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:45.898]  It's basically, hey, here's a billion dollars, come shop in my shop, which is Shop USA, and you can buy whatever you want as long as it's from Shop USA.
[02:49:45.898 --> 02:49:47.599]  It's about buying loyalty.
[02:49:47.599 --> 02:49:53.344]  So they've been able to buy off Egypt, they've been able to buy off the government of India, they've been able to buy off Israel.
[02:49:53.664 --> 02:49:53.884]  We're good.
[02:50:08.558 --> 02:50:14.764]  American corporations, yeah, maybe it's made in China or Taiwan, but the shop front's in America.
[02:50:14.764 --> 02:50:16.945]  But this is the new colonial system.
[02:50:16.945 --> 02:50:18.527]  Now, okay, there's a problem now.
[02:50:18.527 --> 02:50:23.111]  The old colonial system, they raped and pillaged Africa for things like diamonds, okay?
[02:50:23.111 --> 02:50:28.856]  For things like certain kind of textiles, silk, whatever, agriculture products.
[02:50:28.856 --> 02:50:31.899]  Now, the new colonial, the neo-colonial paradigm,
[02:50:32.319 --> 02:50:38.342]  Yeah, we're gonna come back and get into that, and on the back of it, we're told it's for the children.
[02:50:38.342 --> 02:50:41.743]  I've got a new image t-shirt I want to show you on the screen after the break.
[02:50:53.408 --> 02:50:59.312]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good sized meal, I was still starving.
[02:51:08.917 --> 02:51:26.621]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:51:26.621 --> 02:51:32.742]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Youngevity.
[02:51:32.742 --> 02:51:37.863]  The Youngevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that,
[02:51:38.163 --> 02:51:40.825]  You don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:51:40.825 --> 02:51:47.088]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:51:47.088 --> 02:51:48.349]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:51:48.349 --> 02:51:49.229]  It's incredible.
[02:51:49.229 --> 02:51:58.335]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:51:58.335 --> 02:52:00.236]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:52:04.093 --> 02:52:05.314]  Claire, it's Anne.
[02:52:05.314 --> 02:52:08.275]  Hey, you know that hormone-balancing product we talked about before?
[02:52:08.275 --> 02:52:09.336]  The all-natural one.
[02:52:09.336 --> 02:52:09.776]  Ambrin?
[02:52:09.776 --> 02:52:11.217]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[02:52:11.217 --> 02:52:18.421]  Not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[02:52:18.421 --> 02:52:20.242]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[02:52:20.242 --> 02:52:20.762]  It's gone.
[02:52:20.762 --> 02:52:23.223]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[02:52:23.223 --> 02:52:24.064]  I feel great.
[02:52:24.064 --> 02:52:24.584]  Give me a call.
[02:52:24.704 --> 02:52:28.385]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:52:28.385 --> 02:52:32.206]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[02:52:32.206 --> 02:52:36.607]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[02:52:36.607 --> 02:52:38.867]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[02:52:38.867 --> 02:52:41.968]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[02:52:41.968 --> 02:52:46.449]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.

[02:54:04.901 --> 02:54:05.842]  Don't worry.
[02:54:05.842 --> 02:54:07.904]  This show is documented.
[02:54:07.904 --> 02:54:11.348]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:11.348 --> 02:54:16.894]  And let's be clear, I'm not saying the Communist Chinese and what they're doing is some wonderful thing, but I've looked at their strategy.
[02:54:16.894 --> 02:54:25.923]  They've gone in and bought off the government of Australia and are getting something like 98% of the rare earth minerals that are mined out of Australia are now by the Chinese government.
[02:54:27.006 --> 02:54:29.570]  Backed corporate interest.
[02:54:29.570 --> 02:54:30.110]  What, over 90%?
[02:54:30.110 --> 02:54:34.176]  It's like 91% worldwide the Chinese are getting the rare earth minerals.
[02:54:34.176 --> 02:54:40.224]  They're actually trying to compete in a more free market way than what the military industrial complex does here.
[02:54:41.078 --> 02:54:55.206]  Yeah, the Chinese actually, Obama just fired off a couple of salvos at the Chinese today, or yesterday, and he's going to use the WTO in order to play the part of the pit bull.
[02:54:55.206 --> 02:54:56.887]  So, you know, the U.S.
[02:54:56.887 --> 02:54:58.047]  used to be an economic power.
[02:54:58.047 --> 02:54:59.768]  We used to have a manufacturing base.
[02:54:59.768 --> 02:55:02.390]  What we've got left is the service industry.
[02:55:02.390 --> 02:55:04.111]  We've got a bit of media and software.
[02:55:04.831 --> 02:55:07.172]  And we've got retail, okay?
[02:55:07.172 --> 02:55:14.296]  The retail industry is totally dependent, electronics, everything, and the defense industry on rare earth minerals.
[02:55:14.296 --> 02:55:17.318]  But if they're so worried about those, why do they let the Chinese dominate?
[02:55:17.318 --> 02:55:20.200]  Again, why did the West give them the Panama Canal?
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:22.181]  Oh, here, we built it, have it.
[02:55:22.181 --> 02:55:28.364]  Oh, here, we'll put tax incentives to move our companies over there, because the globalists are playing us off against each other.
[02:55:28.564 --> 02:55:29.925]  Yep, yep, exactly.
[02:55:29.925 --> 02:55:38.751]  China is very much in the fabric of the New World Order setup, as we are, or as Europe is, or as some of these emerging BRICS countries.
[02:55:38.751 --> 02:55:40.492]  Go over some of those notes, you've got a bunch.
[02:55:40.492 --> 02:55:52.860]  Okay, well, a lot of people don't realize, know much about rare earth minerals, and I'll tell you what, you better learn about rare earth minerals, because everything that we enjoy as far as technological advances, from your iPod, to your cell phone, to your laptop,
[02:55:53.881 --> 02:55:55.782]  To electric cars, okay?
[02:55:55.782 --> 02:55:57.143]  To solar energy.
[02:55:57.143 --> 02:56:00.366]  Solar energy is dependent on lithium batteries, okay?
[02:56:00.366 --> 02:56:03.108]  There is a finite amount of lithium on the planet.
[02:56:03.108 --> 02:56:05.189]  The other one we've got is a promethium.
[02:56:05.189 --> 02:56:07.331]  That's nuclear batteries, okay?
[02:56:07.331 --> 02:56:10.834]  You know, europium and neodymium, okay?
[02:56:10.834 --> 02:56:15.357]  These are for guided missiles and a lot of advanced military technology.
[02:56:15.357 --> 02:56:16.278]  Lithium!
[02:56:16.278 --> 02:56:18.099]  Lasers and things like this.
[02:56:18.099 --> 02:56:18.520]  Lithium.
[02:56:22.262 --> 02:56:36.606]  Gadolinium, okay, this is a laptop and neodymium cell phones, so cobalt and holonium, nuclear rod, nuclear control rods, all these, you know, they're rampant, they're building nuclear power plants like it's going out of style right now.
[02:56:36.606 --> 02:56:46.208]  And let me tell you something else, the whole Darfur incident, and this is told to me by a top consultant to the European Union as far as, on the energies department,
[02:56:46.548 --> 02:56:50.090]  He said there is a peak uranium issue, okay?
[02:56:50.090 --> 02:56:51.490]  This is a real peak issue.
[02:56:51.490 --> 02:56:58.513]  Not like peak oil that people talk about where there's plenty of oil on the planet to keep consumption for the next 200 years.
[02:56:58.513 --> 02:56:59.894]  There's a peak uranium.
[02:56:59.894 --> 02:57:01.214]  And where's all the uranium?
[02:57:01.214 --> 02:57:02.315]  Sudan.
[02:57:02.315 --> 02:57:04.095]  The biggest deposit of untapped uranium.
[02:57:04.095 --> 02:57:07.297]  And George Clooney wants to help them!
[02:57:07.297 --> 02:57:07.877]  Trendy!
[02:57:08.257 --> 02:57:08.397]  That's
[02:57:26.472 --> 02:57:29.474]  Strategic important thing for America.
[02:57:29.474 --> 02:57:31.715]  What do you think of my attack on Angelina Jolie?
[02:57:31.715 --> 02:57:33.196]  Obviously I did it so we get attention.
[02:57:33.196 --> 02:57:35.837]  You say arrest Kofi Ann and her band Kaimuna, it doesn't happen.
[02:57:35.837 --> 02:57:38.119]  You say arrest her, that'll bring attention to it.
[02:57:38.119 --> 02:57:41.961]  But I think if she wants to say arrest Kony and everybody, well I think she's arrestable then.
[02:57:42.836 --> 02:57:49.002]  Well, you know, people put so much weight and importance on celebrities like Angelina Jolie and George Clooney.
[02:57:49.002 --> 02:57:58.570]  And believe me, Alex, some of my dearest best friends, they just fall over for George Clooney, anything he does or any campaign that he endorses, like he's some kind of saint.
[02:57:58.570 --> 02:57:59.851]  He's probably a nice guy.
[02:57:59.851 --> 02:58:00.852]  He's a very intelligent guy.
[02:58:00.852 --> 02:58:02.794]  He's made some damn good films, right?
[02:58:02.794 --> 02:58:03.915]  But he's not going to tell me.
[02:58:05.616 --> 02:58:09.858]  Well, listen, I like George Clooney as an actor, but I hate his guts because he is smart.
[02:58:09.858 --> 02:58:12.699]  He knows good and well he's a warmongering piece of trash.
[02:58:12.699 --> 02:58:13.699]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:58:13.699 --> 02:58:16.281]  He's pushing all this while saying he's a saint.
[02:58:16.281 --> 02:58:21.363]  That's even worse than George Bush, who was a demonic goblin, but just was launching wars because he wanted to.
[02:58:21.363 --> 02:58:23.143]  Because they're doing it under liberal cover.
[02:58:23.143 --> 02:58:24.224]  Yes, it's disgusting.
[02:58:24.784 --> 02:58:30.610]  Just like Obama's, liberal cover, a liberal umbrella, a force field, a magic cloak, a liberal mask.
[02:58:30.610 --> 02:58:31.370]  I'm liberal!
[02:58:31.370 --> 02:58:43.682]  I mean, look, they have people now dress up in pink and green plaid shirts and literally go, uh, uh, war, trendy, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[02:58:43.682 --> 02:58:46.905]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:03.821 --> 02:59:12.547]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[02:59:29.465 --> 02:59:30.705]  Others don't.

[03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:22.281]  All right, Patrick Henningsen here visiting with us.
[03:00:22.281 --> 03:00:25.663]  Congressman Walter Jones is coming up.
[03:00:25.663 --> 03:00:33.246]  We talked to him today and in the retransmission that streams out to everybody, and some stations carry the fourth hour that's rebroadcast the first.
[03:00:33.246 --> 03:00:37.168]  We've got Congressman Walter Jones on impeachment of Obama, that's big news.
[03:00:37.168 --> 03:00:39.389]  Patrick Henningsen, investigative journalist, joins us.
[03:00:39.389 --> 03:00:45.032]  You've got the floor in the last few minutes we've got here to break down your investigation of this huge AFRICOM invasion.
[03:00:45.692 --> 03:01:01.953]  I wrote an article April 13, 2011, okay, for 21st Century Wire, and it was called The New Cold War in Libya, and it was about the Chinese investments in Libya, and how Chinese took a major hit with the no-fly zone and the bombing of Libya.
[03:01:02.453 --> 03:01:03.955]  Okay, China's everywhere in Africa.
[03:01:03.955 --> 03:01:05.536]  They're in Angola.
[03:01:05.536 --> 03:01:06.958]  They're in Zambia.
[03:01:06.958 --> 03:01:08.019]  They're in Sudan.
[03:01:08.019 --> 03:01:09.460]  They're in Tanzania.
[03:01:09.460 --> 03:01:11.602]  They're in, uh, what's the other one?
[03:01:11.602 --> 03:01:12.683]  Mozambique?
[03:01:12.683 --> 03:01:14.145]  They're big in South Africa.
[03:01:14.145 --> 03:01:16.347]  They have been for the last 20 years.
[03:01:16.347 --> 03:01:19.430]  Okay, China's got a major foothold all over Africa.
[03:01:19.770 --> 03:01:29.836]  Okay, AFRICOM has in its documents, and I linked to this on previous articles, it says specifically, AFRICOM is a bit of a trick as well, Alex.
[03:01:29.836 --> 03:01:41.622]  They say that the People's Republic Army of China might be deployed to deal with things in Africa, and that's why they set up AFRICOM, so the Chinese wouldn't put troops in the African countries.
[03:01:41.622 --> 03:01:46.805]  Now, I would wager to bet that China has no interest in military putting boots on the ground in Africa.
[03:01:46.805 --> 03:01:48.606]  China doesn't do their business like that.
[03:01:48.826 --> 03:01:50.687]  Look at China's record in Africa.
[03:01:50.687 --> 03:01:54.390]  They're into building, investing, creating economies of scale.
[03:01:54.390 --> 03:01:57.151]  They put a port in Angola.
[03:01:57.151 --> 03:02:02.935]  That country's been raped and pillaged by the De Beers and all these corporations for over 100 years.
[03:02:02.935 --> 03:02:07.178]  They have now a state-of-the-art modern seaport in Angola.
[03:02:07.278 --> 03:02:09.000]  But again, what's the schizophrenia here?
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:15.309]  Because the Chinese leadership is really wicked and works with the globalists, even reducing their own population.
[03:02:15.309 --> 03:02:16.911]  It's like a weird double game.
[03:02:16.911 --> 03:02:24.120]  Because the West is saying, get ready for war with China, but then on the other side of that, they're investing with the Chinese.
[03:02:24.120 --> 03:02:24.741]  It's really weird.
[03:02:25.121 --> 03:02:29.507]  China's just securing its own... Look at China as a corporation.
[03:02:29.507 --> 03:02:31.690]  The People's Republic Incorporated, okay?
[03:02:31.690 --> 03:02:38.640]  They're securing their raw materials interests, their rare earth interests, and other... Because the Chinese, you know, good things take a long time to grow.
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:39.982]  It's more of a long-term view.
[03:02:40.242 --> 03:02:52.151]  Yeah, if you read the I Ching, which every Chinese emperor had to have next to him since the Qing Wei dynasty 5,000 years ago, okay?
[03:02:52.151 --> 03:03:02.280]  It's all about long-term plans, it's about thinking ahead, it's about the actions that you do today, what sort of plants will they reap, what flowers will they sow in the future?
[03:03:02.280 --> 03:03:04.201]  That's Chinese philosophy, okay?
[03:03:04.201 --> 03:03:07.624]  Japanese is very similar, they do everything in 5 and 10 year blocks.
[03:03:08.104 --> 03:03:13.388]  We do everything on quarterly reports, which is three months, you know, six months, twelve months.
[03:03:13.388 --> 03:03:18.131]  That's how our corporate culture has become that sort of habit.
[03:03:18.131 --> 03:03:22.755]  But, you know, the thing that really kills me about Kony 2012, Alex, okay?
[03:03:22.755 --> 03:03:24.836]  They put a December deadline in it.
[03:03:24.836 --> 03:03:25.837]  And notice the word 2012, okay?
[03:03:27.458 --> 03:03:27.899]  This is
[03:03:43.802 --> 03:03:45.143]  It's tied to Obama.
[03:03:45.143 --> 03:03:46.283]  It's like a campaign slogan.
[03:04:08.354 --> 03:04:10.855]  Seances and Ouija boards, okay?
[03:04:10.855 --> 03:04:12.696]  This is really getting into the heart.
[03:04:12.696 --> 03:04:17.998]  This is where New Age culture is really invading into our lives, okay?
[03:04:17.998 --> 03:04:21.099]  Our political realities, our social realities.
[03:04:21.099 --> 03:04:24.020]  Using Facebook and Twitter to share, share, share.
[03:04:24.020 --> 03:04:25.661]  Let's everybody share, share, share.
[03:04:25.661 --> 03:04:26.741]  Click, click, share, share.
[03:04:26.741 --> 03:04:27.642]  Click, click.
[03:04:27.642 --> 03:04:31.963]  This is our... They're like, come on, pass it on, get behind it, help!
[03:04:31.963 --> 03:04:33.844]  Northcom wants to love us!
[03:04:34.144 --> 03:04:38.925]  Facebook and Twitter has been used in the Arab Spring to create a more of a significance than was actually there.
[03:04:38.925 --> 03:04:43.246]  In Russia, they tried the same thing with the last presidential election two weeks ago.
[03:04:43.246 --> 03:04:46.527]  They tried to make a big social network sort of presence there.
[03:04:46.527 --> 03:04:48.947]  You know, it's a virtual presence.
[03:04:48.947 --> 03:04:50.007]  It's not real.
[03:04:50.007 --> 03:04:54.548]  The exit polls for Putin were around the same as the votes that were tallied for him.
[03:04:54.548 --> 03:04:58.089]  So that means that there was hardly any... All right, Patrick, great job.
[03:04:58.089 --> 03:04:59.449]  We'll cover it more on the nightly news.
[03:04:59.449 --> 03:05:00.950]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:01.410]  Amazing.
[03:05:01.410 --> 03:05:02.010]  More coming up.
