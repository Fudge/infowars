[00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:17.323]  Black Ops 2, the sequel to the best-selling game of all time, places the player in a year 2025 that isn't very far-fetched.
[00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:20.084]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:23.646]  The original game was praised for its moderate historical accuracy.
[00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:28.068]  Let's analyze these new trailers to see if the same can be said for 2's dystopic future.
[00:00:28.388 --> 00:00:29.149]  Spoiler alert.
[00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:39.334]  Unmanned armies, and no one ever asks... What happens when the enemy steals the keys?
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.082]  Let's start with a look at future technologies.
[00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.834]  Now believe it or not, everything in that clip is in various stages of production or completion.
[00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:02.995]  Take the nuke.
[00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:10.343]  The Brookings Institute reports that over 67,000 nuclear missiles have been built since 1951, a conservative number.
[00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.820]  Next, the tilt-rotor vehicles.
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.263]  The Osprey V-22 has come a long way since George LaBerger patented the tilt-rotor design in 1930.
[00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:25.006]  The walking tank is making fast strides at DARPA, as is the Pegasus drone.
[00:01:26.907 --> 00:01:28.647]  And drones are already flying the U.S.
[00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:33.830]  skies, even though they're vulnerable to hacks and the Pentagon admits that they do not trust their own robots.
[00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:38.083]  Call of Duty chose a different approach with their villain this time, a hacker.
[00:01:39.143 --> 00:01:46.445]  People in America idolizing their hero has wiped them out!
[00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:54.407]  Cyber attacks are constantly in the news, but what's often left on the cutting room floor is that organizations such as the FBI have used hackers for illegal activities.
[00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:59.069]  And the NSA doesn't need hackers because they can tap your phone without a warrant.
[00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.130]  The enemy could be anywhere, and it could be anyone.
[00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:11.203]  The voice in the last clip belongs to Oliver North, the man at the center of the Iran-Contra scandal, where he and others sold U.S.
[00:02:11.343 --> 00:02:13.364]  arms to a foreign country outside of U.S.
[00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:13.684]  law.
[00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:18.246]  But if you try to buy a few boxes of bullets, you may get a call from your local state police.
[00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:24.708]  At the Contra hearings, North was also questioned about continuity of government plans, also known as Rex 84.
[00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:27.829]  Let's take a look at this clip that exposes the cover-up.
[00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.390]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC,
[00:02:32.742 --> 00:02:38.844]  Were you not assigned at one time to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?
[00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:40.744]  Mr. Chairman?
[00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:53.848]  I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area, so may I request that you not touch upon that, sir?
[00:02:54.688 --> 00:02:58.589]  A contingency plan in the event of an emergency that would suspend the
[00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:03.043]  The cause of war in this game is the control of rare earth materials.
[00:03:03.063 --> 00:03:08.065]  Currently, China has a monopoly of over 95% of the materials.
[00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:28.256]  We're bringing a new trade case against China.
[00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:39.738]  This case involves something called rare earth materials, which are used by American manufacturers to make high-tech products like advanced batteries that power everything from hybrid cars to cell phones.
[00:03:40.258 --> 00:03:41.319]  It's time for the spoiler.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:54.182]  At some point in the game, drones are hacked and attack the G20 summit in the year 2025, leaving the player to defend the US president in a war-torn Los Angeles.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.541]  So there you go.
[00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:06.249]  Give up all your rights and sign up for the Internet ID, or Anonymous is going to team up with the Dulcegizman and start blowing stuff up.
[00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.273]  Black Ops 2 is scheduled for release in mid-November.
[00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:11.876]  I'm Ja'Kari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
