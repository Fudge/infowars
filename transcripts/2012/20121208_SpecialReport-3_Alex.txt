[00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:20.508]  Melissa Melton here at the Drone Mob with Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:22.490]  It was a good day.
[00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.712]  I think we had about 100 people show up at various times since we got out here.
[00:00:26.732 --> 00:00:30.234]  It was actually pretty good because we had to move from our original location.
[00:00:30.754 --> 00:00:32.035]  So people still found us.
[00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:32.915]  We had a good time.
[00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:34.676]  A few people brought drones.
[00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:35.997]  I think we broke most of ours.
[00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:36.837]  Yeah, we did.
[00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.599]  Some of those are not going to be repairable.
[00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.720]  Or other people broke, but that's okay.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.743]  It was all good fun and we had a good crowd and a lot of people, most people came out were pretty, you know, up on drone issues.
[00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:50.304]  They at least, you know, knew about domestic drone use.
[00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:52.065]  It's a great time to come out here.
[00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:55.267]  We had people, I met people from San Antonio, some people came from Dallas.
[00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:57.808]  So it's definitely a great time and people do have power.
[00:00:58.048 --> 00:00:58.789]  You have power!
[00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:00.429]  You have power!
[00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.951]  And remember, they're about to set to fill our skies with 30,000 drones at FASA by 2015.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.183]  People say, why do you, you know, use drones to protest drones?
[00:01:21.203 --> 00:01:21.924]  I mean, these are toys.
[00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:26.490]  This is, I mean, if it survived today, which I don't know, Alex would probably shoot it anyway.
[00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.291]  I don't know about that.
