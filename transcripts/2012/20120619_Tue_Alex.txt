[00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:06.133]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.894]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.894 --> 00:00:09.655]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:11.256]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:12.797]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:16.979]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:21.102]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.115]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the 19th day of June 2012.
[00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:44.558]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.558 --> 00:00:50.963]  Coming up in the next hour, investigative journalist, best-selling author, Daniel Estelin.
[00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:53.524]  Will be joining us.
[00:00:53.524 --> 00:01:02.407]  You know, Daniel Estelin got invited after he wrote a book on Bilderberg to Cuba to talk to Fidel Castro a few years ago.
[00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:18.413]  And I was so hyped up whenever I was running around like a piranha, a land piranha at the Bilderberg meeting, foaming at the mouth, covering things, that when I had him on the show, he was in Spain, I was in Virginia,
[00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:23.199]  Walking along the street protesting, you gotta love technology, while I interviewed him.
[00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:25.982]  But I never brought that up, but that's not why he's joining us.
[00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:30.766]  That just popped in my head as I was about to tell you that he was coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:35.031]  Daniel's never contacted us to come on, we always contact him to come on.
[00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:41.677]  But he contacted us because he's got such big news, he wants to break here on Bilderberg.
[00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:58.089]  So Daniel Esselin from Spain, a guy in Europe more than anybody who's exposed Bilderberg, it's Jim Tucker and myself now here in the United States, and of course Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com has really helped break that dam completely down.
[00:01:58.089 --> 00:02:06.116]  But he's got sources inside Bilderberg, in fact one of his sources just separately, he probably doesn't know I know this, I discovered who one of his sources is.
[00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:07.036]  But I'll just leave it at that.
[00:02:09.577 --> 00:02:11.318]  It's very, very interesting.
[00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:13.199]  That is coming up in the second hour.
[00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.261]  I've got a huge amount of very important news.
[00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:31.248]  The good news is, down in Rio, where they've started the big UN World Government Conference, women in mass are protesting the green economy and austerity, saying it will destroy their country.
[00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:33.329]  So, all over South America,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.083]  In Argentina and Brazil and other areas, people are really getting it down there.
[00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:43.745]  In fact, my radio show is extremely popular down there.
[00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:48.008]  I know routinely because I see copies of it online and I mail copies of it.
[00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:49.108]  I love Latin America.
[00:02:49.108 --> 00:02:49.809]  They don't ask.
[00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:55.091]  They just take InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com articles.
[00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:56.832]  Plus it's well known that I authorize that.
[00:02:56.832 --> 00:02:58.272]  I want my info out.
[00:02:58.272 --> 00:03:00.313]  I want it to be republished.
[00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.934]  As long as you don't alter it.
[00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:04.615]  That's what I reserve copyright on.
[00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:07.436]  And they publish our articles in Latin America is the point.
[00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:08.837]  And they know what's going on.
[00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:10.398]  And they're like, no thank you.
[00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:14.776]  We're suing Monsanto over their GMO crops.
[00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:16.577]  We're suing over pesticide.
[00:03:16.577 --> 00:03:18.978]  We're suing over real issues.
[00:03:18.978 --> 00:03:22.799]  We don't want to have our carbon dioxide output taxed.
[00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.981]  Thank you very much.
[00:03:24.981 --> 00:03:37.166]  We've got what Mark Moreno is tomorrow from that event of climatedepot.com and then we've got Lord Monckton on Friday if he hasn't been beaten up or arrested as has happened repeatedly.
[00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.267]  He's been blocked out of the conferences.
[00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:39.627]  He was in
[00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:46.615]  South Africa late last year and had to parachute in to the controlled area kind of like G20.
[00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:48.737]  They locked down a large area of Durban.
[00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:56.226]  He parachuted in and then they backed off at that point because they realized that arresting him would be a big issue.
[00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:57.447]  He's just something else.
[00:03:57.447 --> 00:03:58.609]  You gotta love him.
[00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.410]  What a character.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.882]  So that is coming up here on the broadcast.
[00:04:03.882 --> 00:04:06.803]  Speaking of Drudge Report, this story is up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:12.426]  We covered it yesterday, but it dovetails with another article out of Business Insider.
[00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:13.306]  Leaked!
[00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:16.908]  Microsoft master plan to take over the living room with the new Xbox.
[00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:18.789]  Well, that's always been their plan.
[00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.091]  And their Kinect system, on record, spies on you in your home.
[00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:28.581]  But that integrates in with Apple's iOS 6, includes government alerts, forced government alerts.
[00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:31.826]  You're talking to your son or daughter, your wife or husband, it cuts you off.
[00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.180]  Uh, you're, you're, you're an emergency phone call?
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.560]  A business phone call?
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.042]  Everyone will get the Supreme Leader's, uh, break-in and then it'll be phased in to be local police as well.
[00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:50.325]  So, anything you see in a science fiction dystopia movie or novel, the globalists are adopting it, saying, that's a good idea.
[00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:54.606]  By the way, they're back promoting taser bracelets for all who fly.
[00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:58.748]  Put the taser bracelet on the three-year-old now, after the groping by the pedo.
[00:04:58.748 --> 00:04:59.168]  We'll be back.
[00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.632]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:05:05.632 --> 00:05:08.053]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:17.138]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:17.138 --> 00:05:20.599]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.280]  There's no priming required.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.541]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:27.062]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:29.644]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:31.065]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:34.226]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:37.608]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:39.489]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:41.750]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.491]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:46.072]  It's what my family uses.
[00:05:46.072 --> 00:05:49.374]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:05:49.374 --> 00:05:54.937]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:05:55.197 --> 00:05:58.821]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:01.323]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.323 --> 00:06:06.908]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:11.933]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:06:11.933 --> 00:06:16.978]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:06:17.498 --> 00:06:22.719]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:25.040]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.841]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:30.961]  And here's the best part.
[00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:34.022]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:06:34.022 --> 00:06:37.303]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:06:37.643 --> 00:06:40.825]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:43.046]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:43.046 --> 00:06:43.986]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:44.186]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:06:44.186 --> 00:06:47.628]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:06:47.628 --> 00:06:49.389]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:59.654 --> 00:07:04.076]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods Direct.
[00:07:04.076 --> 00:07:08.217]  As a listener, you know why you need to have a supply of the best storable food on the planet.

[00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.060]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.800]  Food.

[00:07:56.354 --> 00:08:01.277]  More the best for less guarantee.
[00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:03.518]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:06.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.482]  Incredibly important worldwide transmission lined up for you today.
[00:08:22.482 --> 00:08:25.224]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:25.224 --> 00:08:32.067]  Coming up from Spain, Daniel Estlin, investigative journalist, has big breaking news.
[00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:35.989]  So big, he actually contacted our office, something he's never done, wanting to get on the show.
[00:08:35.989 --> 00:08:40.692]  We've normally got to twist his arm onto coming on, because he likes to write instead of really doing interviews.
[00:08:41.232 --> 00:08:47.320]  But he's got big breaking Bilderberg news for us dealing with the globalist and some of their plans.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:55.290]  And I do know for a fact he has multiple Bilderberg sources because separately through my Hollywood connections, I was able to discover who one of them is.
[00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.452]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:08:57.452 --> 00:08:59.695]  Also, Larry Summers has come out.
[00:09:00.476 --> 00:09:02.958]  And talked about a total catastrophe globally.
[00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:12.527]  Well sure, the globalists are engineering that, but they want to milk each country, bailout after bailout, always promising that this bailout will fix the global economy.
[00:09:12.527 --> 00:09:18.973]  Whether it's in Ireland, or Greece, or Spain, or Italy, or the United States, or England, they're not bailouts.
[00:09:18.973 --> 00:09:24.879]  They're direct taxes to the six megabanks that issue the currency and credit of the world.
[00:09:26.246 --> 00:09:29.728]  G20 Summit, Barroso blames Eurozone crisis on U.S.
[00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:35.051]  banks and on the American people and demands a stronger Euro.
[00:09:35.051 --> 00:09:36.032]  And that's always been the plan.
[00:09:36.032 --> 00:09:40.495]  They're going to collapse the old Euro and bring the people into the new dictatorial one.
[00:09:40.495 --> 00:09:41.676]  And that's their own words.
[00:09:41.676 --> 00:09:43.457]  I mean, this is out in the open.
[00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:45.118]  Look, I can't stand Barack Obama.
[00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:46.979]  We're going to be exposing him.
[00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:50.781]  He needs to be politically destroyed and not just sail off into the sunset.
[00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:51.802]  He needs to be punished.
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.161]  That said, it's clear the political winds are turning against Mr. Obama.
[00:09:58.161 --> 00:10:02.102]  Politico reports Kissinger headlines Romney event.
[00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:07.003]  Of course, he also headlined four years ago a Sarah Palin event.
[00:10:07.003 --> 00:10:08.824]  So that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
[00:10:08.824 --> 00:10:10.764]  But you add it together with this.
[00:10:10.764 --> 00:10:14.725]  At the party, Bloomberg tips hand on endorsement New York Times.
[00:10:14.725 --> 00:10:15.846]  Oh yes, it's a leak.
[00:10:15.846 --> 00:10:18.006]  No, it's on purpose.
[00:10:18.006 --> 00:10:21.207]  Obviously, saying that he thinks Mitt Romney is better.
[00:10:22.867 --> 00:10:28.229]  Not a good sign when Bloomberg likes you, a guy that wants to ban civilian ownership of firearms.
[00:10:28.229 --> 00:10:38.253]  By the way, other states I saw on the news today are following suit, and other cities as well, to ban soft drinks, popcorn, milk products.
[00:10:38.253 --> 00:10:52.198]  I mean, government literally in your bathroom, in your toilet, telling you which size toilet you can have, in your light bulbs, in your computer, watching, listening to you, Google driving around with text
[00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:56.862]  Snorkels sticking up, stealing passcodes and downloading everyone's info.
[00:10:56.862 --> 00:11:00.685]  I mean it's beyond 1984 and they're just getting started.
[00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:07.291]  But see what's happening here is there's two parallels because there's been so much liberty and freedom in this country in our history.
[00:11:09.192 --> 00:11:09.452]  I don't know.
[00:11:27.276 --> 00:11:50.650]  With the power structure, with the TSA and its federal power grab, and its attempt to break us, and now rolling out on the streets, and drones, and wars, and checkpoints, and all the new taxes, and regulations, and surveillance, and prisons, and government shipping drugs in with major corporations to destabilize the country and corrupt police.
[00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.231]  Our country's like a nervous system.
[00:11:53.305 --> 00:11:56.026]  Forget the government, but the people, the culture.
[00:11:56.026 --> 00:12:07.992]  And it's under constant bombardment, just as we are individually with propaganda, with chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals, the GMO, the aspartame, the additives.
[00:12:07.992 --> 00:12:12.035]  The globalist's favorite saying is, as above, so below.
[00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:20.379]  What you see writ large on the universe is also writ tiny in the very makeup of matter.
[00:12:21.468 --> 00:12:28.310]  And so everything you see on the mass scale is going on on the tiny scale against you and your family.
[00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.770]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:30.831]  So it's a struggle.
[00:12:30.831 --> 00:12:33.111]  They don't have world government yet.
[00:12:33.111 --> 00:12:38.713]  They're in control of the money, in control of most of the governments, but there's still too much free human activity going on.
[00:12:38.713 --> 00:12:41.474]  And they can't move out in the open against the Second Amendment.
[00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:47.766]  At least until now, because people have refused to budge and understand what it's all about.
[00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:50.948]  They're losing their fight pushing abortion worldwide.
[00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:53.549]  They're losing their fight worldwide on vaccinating.
[00:12:53.549 --> 00:12:54.830]  People are learning about that.
[00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.051]  They're losing their fight pushing GMO.
[00:12:57.051 --> 00:13:02.835]  They're losing their fight, but they're losing it intellectually and in the court of public opinion.
[00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:05.316]  Congress with a 9% approval rating.
[00:13:05.316 --> 00:13:07.718]  Some of the parliaments of Europe have even lower than 9%, but the system
[00:13:11.036 --> 00:13:12.816]  We're in a paradox.
[00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:19.898]  Best of times, worst of times, because the system is still just going full tilt against us.
[00:13:19.898 --> 00:13:24.678]  It's still just rolling out its attacks, even though we're awake.
[00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:38.161]  Now, we've got some big activism first, and I'm going to explain why we're doing this in more detail after the break, but taking us into the break, this article and video is posted right now, red-linked, at the top of InfoWars.com and Featured News.
[00:13:38.161 --> 00:13:39.461]  Explosive activism.
[00:13:40.515 --> 00:13:44.939]  Stop Obama Dictator Contest.
[00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:50.364]  And the point is, his office is being turned into an executive dictatorship.
[00:13:50.364 --> 00:13:57.010]  So I'm calling for everyone to take action with this contest, and if everyone does it, I'm going to do it myself today or tomorrow.
[00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.573]  I've just got so much to do, but I'm going to get it done today or tomorrow.
[00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:02.615]  I'm going to go out and hang these posters up all over Austin.
[00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:14.927]  If our listeners, if everyone listening hangs up at least a few of these in legal and lawful commons areas or hands out a bunch, it is going to have a huge response.
[00:14:14.927 --> 00:14:21.134]  I'll explain why coming up, but here is the video and audio for radio and TV viewers.
[00:14:21.134 --> 00:14:23.776]  It's titled Stop Obama Dictator Contest.
[00:14:23.776 --> 00:14:24.117]  Here it is.
[00:14:31.525 --> 00:14:37.120]  America is starting to wake up to the fact that Barack Obama is becoming a dictator.
[00:14:37.867 --> 00:14:51.758]  You know about him launching wars in Libya, Syria, and other areas, and when Congress comes to him and says, you've got to get authorization from us under the law, under the Constitution, he says, no I don't, because I have the UN and NATO.
[00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:53.119]  That is treason.
[00:14:53.119 --> 00:15:00.124]  Obama has been having the ATF put in new anti-gun regulations outside of law.
[00:15:00.124 --> 00:15:04.668]  Now the ATF's talking about banning most shotguns with a new regulation.
[00:15:05.714 --> 00:15:20.784]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to stand up to Barack Obama and let him know, and let the prestitute, accomplice, collaborator media know that America is waking up and will not put up with this type of executive abuse.
[00:15:20.784 --> 00:15:22.285]  The latest outrage?
[00:15:22.285 --> 00:15:23.786]  Obama came out last Friday.
[00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:32.672]  And he said, I'm going to legalize 80,000 illegal aliens to begin with because I can't get Congress to pass the law.
[00:15:32.672 --> 00:15:38.853]  Just a few years before that, he said that he'd like to act like a dictator, but that he couldn't because of the Constitution.
[00:15:38.853 --> 00:15:44.375]  I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own.
[00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:48.636]  Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting.
[00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:51.956]  Now he's saying he can do this if he wants to.
[00:15:51.956 --> 00:15:53.757]  This is treason.
[00:15:54.577 --> 00:15:58.959]  It is important to create a grassroots campaign to say no to this.
[00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:01.080]  So we're doing something new.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.102]  Two new contests.
[00:16:04.102 --> 00:16:12.086]  $5,000 prize for whoever creates Barack Obama flyer posters and posts them in legal and lawful areas.
[00:16:12.086 --> 00:16:13.566]  Check your local laws.
[00:16:13.566 --> 00:16:15.027]  Videotapes it.
[00:16:15.027 --> 00:16:17.989]  Uploads it to YouTube so it can go viral.
[00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:20.110]  You've only got four and a half days.
[00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.610]  Midnight.
[00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:38.035]  This Friday, print off the flyers at InfoWars.com or create your own poster, post them in legal lawful areas, shoot video of it, upload it to YouTube, send it to Contest at InfoWars.com, and we're going to announce the winner next Monday.
[00:16:38.695 --> 00:16:41.538]  You're not going to have to wait very long on this contest.
[00:16:41.538 --> 00:16:47.566]  And then two weeks after that, three Fridays from now, we're going to have part two of the contest.
[00:16:47.566 --> 00:16:51.430]  And if you win part one, you can still be in part two.
[00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.291]  $10,000 prize.
[00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:58.759]  Now what we're going to do is take these videos and post them so that other people will see the example and go out and post more.
[00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:03.125]  We did this a few years ago with the Joker contest.
[00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:04.647]  Obama as a Joker.
[00:17:04.647 --> 00:17:05.968]  And the media took our bait.
[00:17:05.968 --> 00:17:10.054]  They said, how dare you show our gracious Fuhrer as a Joker.
[00:17:10.054 --> 00:17:11.075]  This should be illegal.
[00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:14.419]  It is a poster showing the president made up like the Joker.
[00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:19.404]  And as West News' Amanda Ober reports, whoever is responsible may face criminal charges.
[00:17:19.404 --> 00:17:21.826]  You shouldn't be able to criticize Obama.
[00:17:21.826 --> 00:17:24.909]  It was in hundreds of newspapers, more than 20, 30, 40, 50.
[00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:27.072]  I lost count.
[00:17:27.072 --> 00:17:31.036]  TV stations from Japan to Ireland to the United States.
[00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:42.461]  This is going to be even bigger, because these authoritarian pigs of the New World Order are going to try to say it's wrong to show Obama as a dictator.
[00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:49.544]  In fact, some of the posters we're making say, Murdering Dictator, His Face, Infowars.com or
[00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:55.288]  Scumbag dictator, Obama's face, Infowars.com.
[00:17:55.288 --> 00:18:00.872]  Our forebearers in the 10 years leading up to the revolution in 1776 did the same thing.
[00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:02.413]  They decried King George III.
[00:18:02.413 --> 00:18:07.617]  They decried the corrupt system and were basically politically demonized for it.
[00:18:07.617 --> 00:18:20.127]  We have to identify that Obama is becoming a dictator because the powers that the executive is grabbing will just be passed on to the next president unless we decry them now.
[00:18:20.407 --> 00:18:25.671]  The traitorous Congress has been told they're slaves of the executive and have gone along with it.
[00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:29.074]  So it's important to let that scum know that we're aware of them.
[00:18:29.074 --> 00:18:31.937]  Follow the link below me for the contest rules.
[00:18:31.937 --> 00:18:33.298]  It's very, very easy.
[00:18:33.298 --> 00:18:47.470]  This country is in deep trouble and we the people will call out this criminal who is saying he'll arrest us under the NDAA, he'll kill us, he'll shut down the internet, he'll hijack our smartphones and take it over with his propaganda messages.
[00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.531]  That he'll launch wars without congressional approval, that he'll do whatever he wants.
[00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.311]  Enough is enough.
[00:18:54.311 --> 00:19:04.033]  Let the maggot, Barack Obama, and all of his criminal mafia that worked for him, that staged Fast and Furious, and so many other crimes, know that you're awake to them.
[00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:07.534]  Last time, the Obama Joker poster went super viral.
[00:19:07.534 --> 00:19:09.535]  This time, it's gonna go even bigger.
[00:19:09.535 --> 00:19:10.695]  Last time, it was only $1,000 in prizes.
[00:19:10.695 --> 00:19:10.875]  This is $15,000.
[00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:12.715]  Part one and part two of the contest.
[00:19:16.576 --> 00:19:25.043]  This is your chance to strike a blow against tyranny and exercise your First Amendment and to have a chance to win up to $15,000.
[00:19:25.043 --> 00:19:29.427]  It's all posted at InfoWars.com and at the link below.
[00:19:29.427 --> 00:19:33.131]  I leave you with the words of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.513]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:19:36.147 --> 00:19:39.370]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:48.199]  It's time that would-be dictators know the sleeping giant that is America and free humanity is awakening.
[00:19:48.199 --> 00:19:52.883]  It's Stop Dictator Obama Contest at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:52.883 --> 00:19:55.086]  Control freak tyrants are gonna hate this.
[00:19:57.878 --> 00:19:59.819]  We'll be right back with more.
[00:19:59.819 --> 00:20:00.340]  Stay with us.
[00:20:28.098 --> 00:20:29.919]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:31.339]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:34.520]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.901]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:20:37.901 --> 00:20:42.043]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:20:42.043 --> 00:20:44.784]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:20:44.784 --> 00:20:46.344]  It's what my family uses.
[00:20:46.344 --> 00:20:49.665]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:55.227]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[00:21:29.594 --> 00:21:38.920]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:46.005]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:46.005 --> 00:21:46.866]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:46.866 --> 00:21:50.128]  Unplacing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.042]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:11.749]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:11.749 --> 00:24:14.631]  Coming up, we've got an exclusive here.
[00:24:14.631 --> 00:24:24.319]  World War II veteran, highly decorated, liberated a prisoner of war camp by parachuting in to a Japanese prisoner of war camp holding U.S.
[00:24:24.319 --> 00:24:24.840]  soldiers.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.961]  I mean, we're talking about the stuff movies are made of.
[00:24:27.882 --> 00:24:29.003]  He's bankrupt.
[00:24:29.003 --> 00:24:30.503]  He's a World War II vet.
[00:24:30.503 --> 00:24:35.986]  They're taking his little piece of property and his house and making him dig up his dead wife.
[00:24:35.986 --> 00:24:38.327]  You cannot make this up.
[00:24:38.327 --> 00:24:47.972]  And remember, this is the age where mega banks take houses that aren't even theirs, that they don't even have deeds to, that are actually paid for and were paid for in cash.
[00:24:48.877 --> 00:24:50.679]  This is the criminality.
[00:24:50.679 --> 00:24:55.345]  The sheriff is refusing to be part of it so the feds are getting ready to come after him.
[00:24:55.345 --> 00:25:00.010]  We're going to try to draw some attention to this thanks to Oath Keepers with Stuart Rhodes.
[00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.693]  We have some clips of an interview he did with a gentleman.
[00:25:02.693 --> 00:25:03.294]  Amazing!
[00:25:03.294 --> 00:25:05.016]  A prisoner of war story as well.
[00:25:07.347 --> 00:25:10.148]  Well, I mean, we can get the number from Stewart.
[00:25:10.148 --> 00:25:12.910]  Actually, when you talk to Stewart, he's agreed to come on.
[00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:18.892]  Get the Vets number so we can probably try to get him on as well, or if not, in a Part 2 interview.
[00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:19.693]  Get that from Stewart.
[00:25:19.693 --> 00:25:20.913]  Thank you.
[00:25:20.913 --> 00:25:30.458]  We have that video now up at InfoWars.com of that powerful 25-minute interview, but we'll be talking to Stewart coming up in the last 30 minutes of the third hour.
[00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:33.239]  Again, Daniel Esselstyn with Breaking News is coming up.
[00:25:35.802 --> 00:25:38.505]  In fact, in the next segment, I'm going to go through a bunch of news.
[00:25:38.505 --> 00:25:41.328]  Holder agrees to meet with Issa, how gracious of him.
[00:25:41.328 --> 00:25:47.494]  Syria, Iran, Russia, and China plan joint war games, Iranian news agency reports.
[00:25:47.494 --> 00:25:51.177]  We told you last week the Russians were sending Marines and ships.
[00:25:51.177 --> 00:25:52.599]  Then the media said it wasn't true.
[00:25:52.599 --> 00:25:54.481]  Now Russia confirms it's true.
[00:25:54.481 --> 00:25:57.423]  McCain urges U.S.-led war in Syria.
[00:25:58.044 --> 00:25:58.984]  That's raw story.
[00:25:58.984 --> 00:26:01.385]  He wants boots on the ground.
[00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:02.865]  Big developments in Europe.
[00:26:02.865 --> 00:26:05.266]  The design implosion accelerates.
[00:26:05.266 --> 00:26:07.147]  Avoid a global catastrophe.
[00:26:07.147 --> 00:26:11.608]  Larry Summers has written an article in the Washington Post saying give the bankers total control.
[00:26:11.608 --> 00:26:15.569]  And just each time they get trillions more, trillions more.
[00:26:15.569 --> 00:26:16.449]  Give us more power.
[00:26:16.449 --> 00:26:17.810]  Make us above the law.
[00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.711]  Make our carbon trading diplomatic immune worldwide.
[00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:24.812]  Just give us total power and we'll turn the economy back on.
[00:26:24.812 --> 00:26:25.592]  Are they doing that?
[00:26:27.318 --> 00:26:28.360]  The answer is no.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.561]  I've also got a very important stack of technology news that we're going to be breaking down, but let me just stop there.
[00:26:35.561 --> 00:26:37.742]  Let me just stop there.
[00:26:37.742 --> 00:26:59.048]  I put up this video, well I shot the video yesterday afternoon, Aaron edited it, had it up by yesterday evening at InfoWars.com, and I right away noticed Obama supporters, not web bots, not fake Department of Justice or defense bots, we can tell how those operate by watching them for years, and the Pentagon admits they have those, but actual Obama supporters
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:06.224]  Because I would go look at their comment, look at their channel last night and this morning, and they've been posting for years.
[00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:08.525]  Many of them are accomplished people.
[00:27:08.525 --> 00:27:10.187]  It's their official channels.
[00:27:10.187 --> 00:27:18.973]  And they're basically engaged in veiled threats that, oh, you'll get your butt kicked if you post a poster bad of Obama.
[00:27:18.973 --> 00:27:20.834]  And, oh, you know, you're not allowed to do that.
[00:27:20.834 --> 00:27:22.755]  Or, oh, you're going to get arrested.
[00:27:22.755 --> 00:27:25.197]  Well, not if it's in legal or lawful areas.
[00:27:25.197 --> 00:27:29.140]  And again, if they try to selectively enforce a law or claim a law doesn't exist,
[00:27:30.655 --> 00:27:37.377]  If they've been hanging garage sale stuff on telephone poles for 20 years and nobody ever got a ticket for it, well then that's up to your discretion at your own risk.
[00:27:37.377 --> 00:27:40.258]  But I'm going to be out hanging them up in commons areas.
[00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:45.780]  I've checked the local laws, and if it's in a commons area, nobody gets tickets for that.
[00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:50.468]  So, I'm going to go do it today or tomorrow.
[00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:53.691]  I'm going to hang up a bunch of Obama dictator posters.
[00:27:53.691 --> 00:27:57.174]  In fact, I need to go ahead and give the order to somebody in my tiny crew.
[00:27:57.174 --> 00:27:59.516]  I don't like giving orders to people that don't exist.
[00:27:59.516 --> 00:28:14.369]  We need to go ahead and get a bunch of these PDFs and get a bunch of these printed, but I want to send them to a print shop and get some double size, you know, double what a regular page printout is, and then a few hundred smaller ones that I'm going to go out myself and
[00:28:15.504 --> 00:28:20.686]  Hang up and staple up or tape up tomorrow, probably tomorrow, at the latest.
[00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:23.788]  I'll do it Thursday.
[00:28:23.788 --> 00:28:27.550]  But the point is we're doing this contest for a reason.
[00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.591]  We're doing this to show the power of the people.
[00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:31.912]  They try to shut the web down with a fake cyber attack.
[00:28:32.947 --> 00:28:36.128]  That could happen, you know, if the globalists do a false full flag.
[00:28:36.128 --> 00:28:37.029]  They've talked about doing it.
[00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:38.949]  They admit Obama has a kill switch.
[00:28:38.949 --> 00:28:40.770]  Or maybe Romney down the road.
[00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:46.472]  People need to know the power of going out and hanging up provocative posters.
[00:28:46.472 --> 00:28:50.014]  Like V for Victory the French did against the Nazis.
[00:28:50.974 --> 00:28:56.140]  Or what our forebearers did during the 1776 adventure, and leading up to it.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.742]  And it's meant to be provocative.
[00:28:57.742 --> 00:29:00.024]  Obama is launching wars that are illegal.
[00:29:00.024 --> 00:29:02.006]  He is killing whole families with drones.
[00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:03.267]  He is a murderer.
[00:29:03.267 --> 00:29:11.196]  And I know he's a puppet, but if I go hang up Henry Kissinger's image, or David Rockefeller, or somebody, it won't get any media attention.
[00:29:11.196 --> 00:29:12.718]  You gotta go after their puppet.
[00:29:14.238 --> 00:29:20.761]  We did this three years ago with the Obama poster because another person hung up some Obama posters and they tried to arrest him.
[00:29:20.761 --> 00:29:21.682]  So I said, that's it.
[00:29:21.682 --> 00:29:22.802]  We're going all the way.
[00:29:22.802 --> 00:29:23.403]  And it was huge.
[00:29:23.403 --> 00:29:27.925]  And they tried to get people there, but they would call police and say, arrest this person, arrest that.
[00:29:27.925 --> 00:29:30.166]  They couldn't because it's free speech.
[00:29:30.166 --> 00:29:35.469]  As long as you don't put it on somebody's private property or don't put it on federal stuff, you know, like, um,
[00:29:36.647 --> 00:29:38.348]  What do you call them, post office boxes?
[00:29:38.348 --> 00:29:42.129]  Put it in the big commons area, legal awful areas, the side of your barn, whatever.
[00:29:42.129 --> 00:29:44.830]  And I'm gonna finish up with this when we come back.
[00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.911]  Folks trying to intimidate us.
[00:29:46.911 --> 00:29:49.652]  Straight ahead and in the news.
[00:29:49.652 --> 00:29:51.053]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.053 --> 00:29:53.574]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.574 --> 00:29:56.255]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.771 --> 00:30:07.433]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:07.433 --> 00:30:12.575]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:12.575 --> 00:30:21.298]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:21.298 --> 00:30:25.360]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.580]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:30:29.656 --> 00:30:34.377]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:30:34.377 --> 00:30:38.199]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:30:38.199 --> 00:30:39.439]  Others don't.
[00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:41.600]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.380]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.261]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:52.883]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:30:52.883 --> 00:30:57.965]  Order yours at gusset.com Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:30:57.965 --> 00:30:58.465]  Others don't.
[00:30:59.978 --> 00:31:05.483]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:31:05.483 --> 00:31:07.905]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:31:07.905 --> 00:31:17.012]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:17.012 --> 00:31:20.455]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[00:31:24.418 --> 00:31:26.920]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:31:27.961 --> 00:31:29.502]  Easy to set up and use.

[00:31:30.924 --> 00:31:34.086]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:31:34.086 --> 00:31:37.469]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:31:37.469 --> 00:31:41.612]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:31:41.612 --> 00:31:44.354]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:31:44.354 --> 00:31:45.916]  It's what my family uses.

[00:33:05.647 --> 00:33:11.689]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:11.689 --> 00:33:14.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:21.274]  I want to just say one little note here real fast before I forget to make it because I've been thinking about the last few days.
[00:33:21.274 --> 00:33:27.140]  I know why Rand Paul endorsed Mitt Romney.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.404]  I understand the political decision and I think Rand Paul's a great guy.
[00:33:31.404 --> 00:33:33.185]  So is Ron Paul, but he's not Ron Paul.
[00:33:33.185 --> 00:33:40.072]  I mean that's true what Lou Rockwell and others have said, but I understand the need and the desire
[00:33:42.062 --> 00:34:00.811]  To want to make things better and to project onto someone like Mitt Romney that well maybe they're better than Obama because they were nice to me and because they sat in a room with me and said they agreed with me that abortion's bad and agreed that the Second Amendment's good.
[00:34:00.811 --> 00:34:03.812]  The problem is Mitt Romney has always been against those things.
[00:34:03.812 --> 00:34:10.956]  But maybe because he is a Republican, I see the argument that he won't be able to go against those type of issues.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.662]  Because of his constituents won't let him.
[00:34:14.662 --> 00:34:16.643]  I still think that's an overall naive view.
[00:34:16.643 --> 00:34:29.773]  But I was hurt at first and angry at Ron Paul because now they've had campaign people come out and say in press releases, I saw it last night, that yes, of course, Ron Paul helped coordinate that.
[00:34:29.773 --> 00:34:33.035]  So, you know, don't be mad at Rand because Ron's involved.
[00:34:33.035 --> 00:34:34.677]  They're now using that.
[00:34:34.677 --> 00:34:36.358]  Well, obviously, Ron Paul was involved.
[00:34:37.202 --> 00:34:42.363]  And I got mad at people lecturing me, saying, oh, Ron Paul didn't know, or Ron Paul's not involved.
[00:34:42.363 --> 00:34:46.344]  Give me a break, okay?
[00:34:46.344 --> 00:34:48.804]  And I know the Poles are tired of running against the wind.
[00:34:48.804 --> 00:34:53.225]  They're tired of always trying like salmon to swim upstream.
[00:34:53.225 --> 00:34:57.866]  But that's why Ron Paul's been so successful and stood out, because he never compromised.
[00:34:57.866 --> 00:34:59.226]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:34:59.226 --> 00:35:00.326]  I get why they did it.
[00:35:00.326 --> 00:35:01.187]  I understand it.
[00:35:01.187 --> 00:35:02.487]  Look, Obama is so bad.
[00:35:03.703 --> 00:35:08.987]  I've described this myself, that I have this thought process that, oh, maybe Mitt Romney is good.
[00:35:08.987 --> 00:35:11.168]  But then I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute, Alex.
[00:35:11.168 --> 00:35:12.429]  Pinch yourself.
[00:35:12.429 --> 00:35:16.131]  You know that this is all part of a globalist operation.
[00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:19.373]  I mean, we've got Mayor Bloomberg now endorsing Mitt Romney.
[00:35:19.373 --> 00:35:25.217]  And that isn't even saying that Mitt Romney's worse than Obama.
[00:35:25.217 --> 00:35:31.882]  Because somebody so bad, like Mr. Tyrant-in-Chief over New York, Bloomberg is endorsing him.
[00:35:34.895 --> 00:35:38.037]  That's happening because the elite are done with Obama.
[00:35:38.037 --> 00:35:39.717]  He was never anybody.
[00:35:39.717 --> 00:35:40.758]  He was a husk.
[00:35:40.758 --> 00:35:42.059]  He was a front man.
[00:35:42.059 --> 00:35:45.700]  He was a puppet, just like all these other high-level politicians.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:51.903]  And that's what's sad, because the process of compromising turns you into a puppet.
[00:35:51.903 --> 00:36:01.628]  So I think it's good that we've let Ron Paul and Rand Paul and their media people know that we're upset, but it shouldn't be something that demoralizes everybody.
[00:36:01.628 --> 00:36:03.189]  I've now had a week and a half to think about this.
[00:36:04.585 --> 00:36:11.545]  Now shifting gears, why am I going up against Obama if he is politically like garbage that's to be taken out of the curb?
[00:36:12.742 --> 00:36:14.723]  Because he's not gone yet.
[00:36:14.723 --> 00:36:18.746]  He could stage a terror attack, as a lot of his top advisors have been telling him to do.
[00:36:18.746 --> 00:36:25.151]  Even though he's a puppet, there are different factions of the power structure that are in the Democrat and Republican parties.
[00:36:25.151 --> 00:36:30.435]  They may want to hold on to power like Clinton before the election and Oklahoma City.
[00:36:30.435 --> 00:36:40.302]  And they've got all those fundraising letters and statements in the Financial Times of London by Shapiro and others about an Oklahoma City or 9-11 would really help us win.
[00:36:42.128 --> 00:36:43.309]  The election.
[00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:48.213]  And so some of their underlings or some of the minions of the system could do anything.
[00:36:48.213 --> 00:36:50.135]  A fake assassination attempt.
[00:36:50.135 --> 00:36:52.297]  That would give him probably 15 points.
[00:36:52.297 --> 00:36:53.198]  Right through the election.
[00:36:53.198 --> 00:36:54.940]  Probably 30 or 40 at first.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.920]  For a week or so.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.302]  You know, a sympathy vote.
[00:36:57.302 --> 00:36:58.523]  Of people just getting into the hype.
[00:37:01.325 --> 00:37:06.967]  But 15 up to the election, say, if it happened next week, God forbid.
[00:37:06.967 --> 00:37:07.827]  He could do anything.
[00:37:07.827 --> 00:37:11.448]  They could start a new war in Syria that a lot of them are pushing.
[00:37:11.448 --> 00:37:12.528]  I mean, a hot war.
[00:37:12.528 --> 00:37:16.409]  Boots on the ground, as they're calling for all over the news.
[00:37:16.409 --> 00:37:18.630]  Remember, six months ago, I said they want boots on the ground.
[00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.190]  Oh, conspiracy theory, fear monger.
[00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.090]  It's not going to happen now.
[00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:21.731]  It's happening.
[00:37:21.731 --> 00:37:23.451]  And they're using al-Qaeda to start the war.
[00:37:23.451 --> 00:37:24.371]  It's incredible.
[00:37:24.371 --> 00:37:27.092]  Who could make something that crazy up?
[00:37:27.092 --> 00:37:29.433]  Give all your rights up, because al-Qaeda is hiding under your toilet.
[00:37:31.889 --> 00:37:34.972]  Don't worry, the Toilet Safety Police will grope you to keep you safe.
[00:37:34.972 --> 00:37:39.195]  But, the globalists that have hijacked our country are using Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria.
[00:37:39.195 --> 00:37:41.837]  I know, I'm digressing.
[00:37:41.837 --> 00:37:44.459]  He could do anything.
[00:37:44.459 --> 00:37:49.103]  And again, people are like, well, what's the point of just being Mitt Romney anyways?
[00:37:49.103 --> 00:37:57.490]  Well, different factions could escalate things into a crisis instead of a gentle handover of power to the next puppet.
[00:37:58.715 --> 00:38:05.078]  So we're in a very dangerous, critical time right now.
[00:38:05.078 --> 00:38:12.521]  An extremely, extremely important time at this juncture right now.
[00:38:12.521 --> 00:38:16.842]  And our First Amendment's under attack now more than ever.
[00:38:16.842 --> 00:38:25.086]  And because the election's heated up, I see threats on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, on the Obama deception, one version's got like,
[00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:27.871]  Almost 11 million views on YouTube.
[00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:31.472]  I see threats on there that we're going to get you guys.
[00:38:31.472 --> 00:38:33.452]  And then you go to the sites, it's real people.
[00:38:33.452 --> 00:38:39.594]  You go to the YouTube pages who really think it's racist to criticize Obama.
[00:38:39.594 --> 00:38:47.537]  And that's because MSNBC and others say if you even show an image of a black person in a newspaper doing something wrong, it's racist.
[00:38:48.447 --> 00:38:59.572]  And I've talked about experiencing this myself, catching a white guy paying off two black guys to go give a testimony and pose as gang members to say restrict guns, you know, gangbangers like us are dangerous.
[00:38:59.572 --> 00:39:02.793]  I exposed that and the paper called me up and said, are you racist?
[00:39:02.793 --> 00:39:03.874]  And I said, is this a joke?
[00:39:03.874 --> 00:39:05.155]  And they said, no.
[00:39:05.155 --> 00:39:07.776]  And I thought it was a prank call and said, give me your number.
[00:39:07.776 --> 00:39:09.917]  I'll call you back at the statesman.
[00:39:09.917 --> 00:39:10.937]  The guy gave me his number.
[00:39:10.937 --> 00:39:13.658]  I called him back, transferred through, got him.
[00:39:13.658 --> 00:39:14.739]  And I was like, this is real?
[00:39:15.776 --> 00:39:19.778]  And he said, yeah, would you have done that report if they'd have been white being paid off?
[00:39:19.778 --> 00:39:21.679]  And I said, is that a joke?
[00:39:21.679 --> 00:39:24.000]  And the guys went to print with that.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.502]  That's what these people do.
[00:39:28.502 --> 00:39:32.584]  Okay, that's what Bill Maher does.
[00:39:32.584 --> 00:39:36.166]  You know, the mayor of DC says Asians shouldn't be allowed to live there.
[00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.507]  He puts an image of him up.
[00:39:38.507 --> 00:39:40.728]  The former mayor, boom, it's racist.
[00:39:41.743 --> 00:39:43.288]  Bill Maher says drudges.
[00:39:43.288 --> 00:39:48.303]  This is how they operate and they know full well that
[00:39:49.602 --> 00:39:52.683]  People aren't predominantly going after Obama because he's black.
[00:39:52.683 --> 00:39:53.524]  You know what?
[00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:58.846]  White people are the folks that put Obama in there, put him over the top with a big win.
[00:39:58.846 --> 00:40:02.468]  White people hoped this would bring racial reconciliation.
[00:40:02.468 --> 00:40:08.871]  A lot of conservatives who are kind of mainline voted for him just to try to create friendliness.
[00:40:08.871 --> 00:40:11.052]  It didn't work because the system never wanted that.
[00:40:11.052 --> 00:40:13.013]  It's about driving a wedge.
[00:40:13.013 --> 00:40:13.873]  That's why they want
[00:40:14.173 --> 00:40:22.360]  Unlimited illegal aliens here to be put on welfare and be clients of the government who can then be legalized with all these motor voter things.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.643]  I mean, I saw an article today where dogs are getting registered and able to vote.
[00:40:26.643 --> 00:40:35.050]  And they can then, I mean, that's the old trick of the book, bring in foreigners who will go along with the corrupt bankers that have hijacked the country to sell the nation out.
[00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.853]  This is treason that we're talking about here.
[00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:40.815]  And I don't just use those words lightly.
[00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:54.430]  So before I get into the news, banning of gardens, you name it, this is the type of comments, there's a whole bunch of them on the video, that's at Infowars.com, titled, Stop Obama Dictator Contest, linked in red.
[00:40:54.430 --> 00:41:07.442]  Please email the video out to everybody, even if you're not gonna take, and again, the contest just makes it fun, the $5,000 prize that I'll announce next Monday, I'm putting myself on a time frame here, where it's gonna move quick.
[00:41:09.045 --> 00:41:10.567]  I'll announce it Monday night on the Nightly News.
[00:41:10.567 --> 00:41:15.351]  We're on hiatus this week while we get some new people hired and finish up a few things.
[00:41:15.351 --> 00:41:28.264]  I've just bitten off so much I can't even complete half the stuff I got in the pike to be completed so I'm doing another pit stop and then we're going to relaunch the Nightly News, you know, five nights a week next Monday and I'll announce the winner at the end of the $5,000 prize.
[00:41:28.264 --> 00:41:29.685]  But that just makes it fun.
[00:41:29.685 --> 00:41:32.468]  Everybody wins by exercising the First Amendment.
[00:41:33.905 --> 00:41:44.492]  And I see the comments on the video in there, on YouTube itself, and it's, ha ha ha ha ha, Alex Jones is trying to get you killed in a big way.
[00:41:44.492 --> 00:41:46.694]  See, that's the message.
[00:41:46.694 --> 00:41:53.619]  Why don't you, Alex, lead your pack of followers and be the first to make up a poster and post them everywhere?
[00:41:55.558 --> 00:41:56.959]  Well, we did that.
[00:41:56.959 --> 00:41:58.921]  We did that three years ago.
[00:41:58.921 --> 00:42:00.542]  We were the first to go out and hang them up.
[00:42:00.542 --> 00:42:02.003]  I mean, I go out in public all the time.
[00:42:02.003 --> 00:42:06.906]  I mean, local talk show hosts have bodyguards.
[00:42:06.906 --> 00:42:13.852]  I just went right out to Bilderberg with no bodyguard for four days with plainclothes Marines trying to set us up with bomb threats.
[00:42:13.852 --> 00:42:23.579]  I mean, I'm not up here saying I'm a tough guy, but, you know, I always love these absolute cowards on the Internet trying to imply there's some actual threats in here by some of these guys.
[00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:33.468]  You know, these people trying to act like, A, I'm a coward, B, we're all cowards, and C, we better watch our back.
[00:42:33.468 --> 00:42:36.953]  That's the reason we're doing this, Jack.
[00:42:36.953 --> 00:42:38.636]  And I went to the guy's website.
[00:42:38.636 --> 00:42:40.940]  He's a somewhat successful black rapper.
[00:42:42.073 --> 00:42:43.514]  That said this.
[00:42:43.514 --> 00:42:46.136]  And he goes on to say, including on your front lawn.
[00:42:46.136 --> 00:42:47.877]  Oh, the implication is, I'll get it.
[00:42:47.877 --> 00:42:51.180]  And let's see how it fares out.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.122]  Well, I would really hate anybody that did something in my house.
[00:42:54.122 --> 00:42:56.784]  That would not be advised when I'm there.
[00:42:56.784 --> 00:43:00.147]  That would not be a healthy move.
[00:43:00.147 --> 00:43:05.051]  Number two, if I did live in the city, I would put some in my front yard.
[00:43:05.051 --> 00:43:08.974]  I live back in the woods, you see, with the woman and the kids and the dogs in me.
[00:43:10.094 --> 00:43:13.079]  I got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive.
[00:43:13.079 --> 00:43:14.441]  And a .50 cal.
[00:43:14.441 --> 00:43:15.342]  And more.
[00:43:15.342 --> 00:43:16.624]  And still more.
[00:43:16.624 --> 00:43:18.948]  So... And still more.
[00:43:18.948 --> 00:43:22.132]  And so... And cameras everywhere.
[00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:22.773]  And still more.
[00:43:24.144 --> 00:43:27.867]  And not just the little French bulldogs you see on video.
[00:43:27.867 --> 00:43:29.429]  No, those aren't the only dogs.
[00:43:29.429 --> 00:43:38.416]  So, I'm here trying to understand, I'm bad and I better watch it, and I'm gonna get people hurt, not if they're out legally and lawfully, hanging up signs.
[00:43:38.416 --> 00:43:44.942]  And if somebody did try to do something to that, that's that person's problem, not my problem, that people don't respect free speech in this country.
[00:43:46.798 --> 00:43:53.402]  So don't give in to the punks out there that are trying to shoot their mouths off like big men on the internet, but never in person.
[00:43:53.402 --> 00:43:56.524]  That you better not dare hang up stuff and defile the great leader.
[00:43:56.524 --> 00:43:58.005]  That's why I did this three years ago.
[00:44:00.606 --> 00:44:13.778]  It was because somebody was hanging these up in Los Angeles, similar to what we had put up, an Obama joker, and they were talking about arresting him, and the news was saying, oh, it's illegal not to hang stuff up in public commons, but to criticize Obama.
[00:44:13.778 --> 00:44:20.223]  Local papers in Central Texas, the Kyle paper, called it hate speech, and said, should I be arrested?
[00:44:20.223 --> 00:44:23.686]  Because people were hanging him up on telephone poles.
[00:44:23.686 --> 00:44:27.109]  Not because it was, they say, illegal to hang him up on telephone poles,
[00:44:28.067 --> 00:44:32.476]  That's a commons, people have been posting it, then it's common law, you can do it.
[00:44:32.476 --> 00:44:35.222]  No, because we were criticizing him.
[00:44:35.222 --> 00:44:37.947]  Listen, I'll criticize anybody I want.
[00:44:37.947 --> 00:44:38.408]  People are like...
[00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:41.867]  On the other hand, they're like, Alex has got to be a Fed.
[00:44:41.867 --> 00:44:48.633]  Nobody could hang up posters like this calling Obama a murderer and get away with it if they weren't.
[00:44:48.633 --> 00:44:57.120]  Listen, just because you've never done anything in your life, just because you're gripped by fear, don't associate your fear with me, okay?
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:06.708]  I have committed to this fight and it's nothing, nothing to tell people to go hang up some signs exposing that Obama's becoming a dictator.
[00:45:07.932 --> 00:45:22.998]  And the fact that people, A, are threatening us over it, and others, and B, saying it's impossible, no one could be this bold, no one could go with several thousand people over five days and bullhorn world leaders and heads of state at point-blank range into their vehicles.
[00:45:22.998 --> 00:45:26.239]  The reason we have the First Amendment is because we're exercising it.
[00:45:26.239 --> 00:45:30.541]  They're trying to get rid of it all over the world, free speech in general, and the First Amendment here.
[00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:33.682]  The reason we have the right to film police is because we're exercising it.
[00:45:34.571 --> 00:45:38.892]  You understand there's a parallel track of liberty on one side and tyranny on the other.
[00:45:38.892 --> 00:45:44.014]  And if we don't exercise the liberty muscles, they will atrophy and the tyrants will take over.
[00:45:44.014 --> 00:45:50.556]  This is an eternal, continual struggle over every inch of dirt.
[00:45:50.556 --> 00:45:59.939]  You know, I think about my grandfather, who always told everybody that he was, my dad's dad, that he was a cook in the Army Air Corps.
[00:45:59.939 --> 00:46:03.000]  Until decades after he died, he died back in like 1981,
[00:46:09.252 --> 00:46:16.898]  Decades after he was dead, my grandmother had died and my dad got his... Well, my uncle actually got him, but my dad got to look at him.
[00:46:16.898 --> 00:46:19.380]  We got to look at him and take some photos of it.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:26.366]  My grandfather's Army Air Corps graduation book, and then the letters and medals and stuff like that.
[00:46:26.366 --> 00:46:29.168]  And, you know, he only had to do the basic missions over Europe.
[00:46:30.885 --> 00:46:33.446]  And on average, yeah, only 22 missions.
[00:46:33.446 --> 00:46:36.947]  That's why I say catch 22, but half the time in those missions, they were dying.
[00:46:36.947 --> 00:46:38.407]  That's how dangerous it was.
[00:46:38.407 --> 00:46:43.569]  Imagine the people that did even more and never wanted to be known about.
[00:46:43.569 --> 00:46:52.512]  See, that's why we admire people in the military, is the memory of when our military actually went into situations where half the people died, in many cases.
[00:46:53.908 --> 00:47:02.970]  Or I think about my uncle, who flew helicopters in Vietnam and got shot up and was highly decorated and I know listening to the show right now never wants to talk about it.
[00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:12.253]  That's the difference, that's what a warrior is, even if the war is wrong, in the case of Vietnam, is when you're actually facing other men with weapons that can resist you.
[00:47:12.253 --> 00:47:20.095]  Not cowardly drones flying around killing whole families so you can say you get one terrorist and then they want to use the drones against us.
[00:47:22.165 --> 00:47:29.386]  And then they want to criticize Syria if one child gets killed when the West is funding Al-Qaeda to attack their government, and that government's responding.
[00:47:29.386 --> 00:47:34.628]  We're supposed to get sad about the one dead girl, but not care about the thousands, well, millions of other dead.
[00:47:34.628 --> 00:47:37.568]  This is all being done in our name.
[00:47:37.568 --> 00:47:50.791]  And I think about modern Americans who are shocked that I would dare say hang up signs pointing out that Obama is becoming a dictator, launching wars without approval, shutting down power plants, gun control, legalizing illegals.
[00:47:50.791 --> 00:47:51.651]  I mean, this is treason.
[00:47:53.919 --> 00:48:01.228]  We ought to create a poster that says, got treason with Obama, maybe as Mao.
[00:48:01.228 --> 00:48:01.769]  We'll do that.
[00:48:01.769 --> 00:48:03.991]  I mean, whatever poster you want, just exposing.
[00:48:03.991 --> 00:48:06.414]  $5,000 prize.
[00:48:08.868 --> 00:48:12.409]  This Friday, I'll give it out next Monday and then two Fridays later, 10,000.
[00:48:12.409 --> 00:48:13.629]  Just phase two.
[00:48:13.629 --> 00:48:15.450]  You win the first prize, you can win the second prize.
[00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:16.050]  Do it now.
[00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:17.871]  It's about taking action.
[00:48:17.871 --> 00:48:22.272]  And then I think about how people can't believe that I would do something like this because I'm supposed to live in fear.
[00:48:22.272 --> 00:48:30.235]  And I think about World War II veteran being forced out of his home because he's bankrupt and forced to exhume his wife's body.
[00:48:30.235 --> 00:48:31.175]  He owns the land.
[00:48:32.432 --> 00:48:32.812]  Outright.
[00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:15.120]  Larger numbers, that's what people were like in the past, and now Americans can't believe I would get up here and say Obama's a dictator.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.401]  I mean, I'm a hero, I've got courage.
[00:49:18.401 --> 00:49:20.683]  No, I'm not, and I'm sick of it.
[00:49:20.683 --> 00:49:27.646]  The bar has been lowered so much in this country, down to almost nothing.
[00:49:27.646 --> 00:49:32.729]  By the way, you know the story about that gentleman who was beaten to death?
[00:49:35.054 --> 00:49:37.897]  Out in California, what was his name?
[00:49:37.897 --> 00:49:38.938]  Thomas Kelly.
[00:49:38.938 --> 00:49:44.723]  Out in the same area, another schizophrenic person was beaten to death and tortured to death the very same way.
[00:49:44.723 --> 00:49:52.911]  And these videos get released and they aren't even resisting and the cops just take their time beating your brains out and breaking your ribs and breaking your throat.
[00:49:52.911 --> 00:49:55.814]  And I just think about what we've become.
[00:49:55.814 --> 00:49:59.598]  What is tough today is being a big fat bully.
[00:50:02.173 --> 00:50:12.123]  Is attacking somebody with a drone or attacking somebody when there's 10 cops and some hundred pound schizophrenic person, you know, who thinks you're, you know, thinks you're monsters.
[00:50:12.123 --> 00:50:18.790]  And to hear these guys when they cry and beg as they're slowly killed, crying for their mommies and their daddies and the cops are getting all excited.
[00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:20.251]  I mean, wow.
[00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:22.173]  Steroids does that to you?
[00:50:22.173 --> 00:50:24.956]  Because I mean, I don't know how somebody normally gets off on that.
[00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:38.994]  I mean, yeah, if you're in a fight, somebody attacks you, they're hurting you pretty bad, and you finally get the better of them, and I get being vicious and banging their head in the ground a few times to make sure they don't get back up, that's a satisfying feeling because you won.
[00:50:38.994 --> 00:50:40.515]  But they started it.
[00:50:40.515 --> 00:50:46.779]  I don't understand wanting to sit there and go brutal on men, women, and children.
[00:50:46.779 --> 00:50:49.240]  I don't understand how we became like this as a society.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.301]  And I'm already digressing.
[00:50:50.301 --> 00:50:54.284]  When we come back, all over the country, they're de facto banning gardens.
[00:50:54.884 --> 00:50:56.390]  And I told you where it would start.
[00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:58.096]  Tulsa, Oklahoma.

[00:52:00.848 --> 00:52:04.829]  Lied to by corrupt Washington politicians and the Wall Street propaganda machine.
[00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:07.710]  My name is Brett Kitchen and I want to give you a free copy of my Inc.
[00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:21.056]  Magazine best-selling book, Safe Money Millionaire, because more Americans than ever are worried about having enough money in retirement, frustrated with losses in their 401ks or mutual funds, and upset about skyrocketing government debt and being ravaged by taxes.
[00:52:21.556 --> 00:52:25.941]  The Wall Street Casino has recently had all the previous gains of 2012 wiped out.
[00:52:25.941 --> 00:52:31.026]  And after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed several years ago, I said enough.
[00:52:31.026 --> 00:52:35.391]  Since then I discovered an IRS approved way to safely grow my money 12 to even 17%, cut taxes dramatically,
[00:52:37.933 --> 00:52:38.454]  We're good to go.

[00:54:23.768 --> 00:54:29.932]  I'm going to get into the attack on true sustainability and just trying to be self-sufficient here in a moment.
[00:54:30.856 --> 00:54:40.128]  But first off, I want to tell you about some of the great products that I personally use and that are discounted and available at InfoWarsHop.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:54:40.128 --> 00:54:42.812]  The Modo Phylon is the best.
[00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:45.135]  We did a lot of research because I wanted to start taking this myself.
[00:54:45.996 --> 00:54:52.102]  The best brown seaweed and it comes from New Zealand so there's no radiation in it from Fukushima.
[00:54:52.102 --> 00:54:53.603]  It's the most concentrated out there.
[00:54:53.603 --> 00:54:56.606]  I talked to so many experts and they all said this is the brand.
[00:54:56.606 --> 00:55:02.271]  It's discounted with a free citizen rule book and more at InfoWars.com or InfoWarsShop.com.

[00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:18.139]  None of the plastic and the garbage in it blows the competition away.

[00:55:30.532 --> 00:55:33.194]  I'm getting ready for another trip soon, folks, and a new investigation.
[00:55:33.194 --> 00:55:37.838]  The point is we've got the ProPure systems 10% off with the promo code WATER.
[00:55:37.838 --> 00:55:41.741]  Nobody has got it even near that price at InfoWarshop.com.

[00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:55.072]  If you have friends and family that don't understand,
[00:55:55.672 --> 00:55:59.341]  That A, it's not the law, and B, the dangers.
[00:55:59.341 --> 00:56:00.885]  The new film, it's award-winning.
[00:56:00.885 --> 00:56:02.509]  It's won a whole bunch of major...
[00:56:03.959 --> 00:56:08.683]  Major, I don't know, it's won more than 15 film festivals, big ones.
[00:56:08.683 --> 00:56:10.004]  It's available, The Greater Good.
[00:56:10.004 --> 00:56:11.906]  I'm going to get these folks on next week.
[00:56:11.906 --> 00:56:15.789]  This is available at InfoWars.com or InfoWarshop.com.

[00:56:31.763 --> 00:56:34.886]  You can also call 888-253-3139.
[00:56:34.886 --> 00:56:45.516]  I'll cover this more in the third hour when I get into all the other news that Daniel Esselstyn leaves us, because it dovetails into banks taking people's property.
[00:56:45.516 --> 00:56:47.859]  I thought they had homesteading rules in most states.
[00:56:47.859 --> 00:56:50.321]  I don't know how they're taking this World War II vets, but...
[00:56:52.921 --> 00:56:54.322]  Stuart Rhodes has been out there to interview him.
[00:56:54.322 --> 00:56:55.443]  He's on with us.
[00:56:55.443 --> 00:56:56.884]  And we do have the vet coming on as well.
[00:56:56.884 --> 00:56:59.106]  He's going to be at the VA or driving to the VA when he comes on.
[00:56:59.106 --> 00:56:59.827]  World War II vet.
[00:56:59.827 --> 00:57:01.588]  World War II hero.
[00:57:01.588 --> 00:57:03.349]  Not many of them left.
[00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:05.972]  And Stuart's a constitutional lawyer.
[00:57:05.972 --> 00:57:06.512]  Award winning.
[00:57:06.512 --> 00:57:08.313]  I think it was top of his class.
[00:57:08.313 --> 00:57:09.635]  Won the big treatise award.
[00:57:09.635 --> 00:57:11.276]  Was it Princeton or Yale?
[00:57:11.276 --> 00:57:12.137]  It was Princeton, wasn't it?
[00:57:12.137 --> 00:57:14.258]  The point is, he's gone and looked over it.
[00:57:14.258 --> 00:57:14.799]  It's true.
[00:57:14.799 --> 00:57:15.719]  He's investigated it.
[00:57:15.719 --> 00:57:18.622]  And I don't know how they take your property.
[00:57:21.087 --> 00:57:24.468]  When it's already paid for just because you went bankrupt.
[00:57:24.468 --> 00:57:35.173]  But, you know, we saw an article out of England yesterday where they kicked people out of the military 22 years in, right as they're about to be able to retire with full benefits.
[00:57:35.173 --> 00:57:38.194]  Full benefits was 12,000 pounds a year.
[00:57:38.194 --> 00:57:41.256]  How do you live on 12,000 pounds a year?
[00:57:41.256 --> 00:57:43.817]  That's like $18,000.
[00:57:43.817 --> 00:57:46.498]  In England, folks, England is so expensive.
[00:57:46.498 --> 00:57:46.838]  That's like $6,000.
[00:57:49.326 --> 00:57:52.829]  I mean, how would you live on $6,000, $7,000 a year?
[00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:59.615]  Some of these guys have, like, you know... I was also reading, well, they do it here, where you have disabled people they're trying to cheat.
[00:57:59.615 --> 00:58:01.777]  And again, they claim everything is about the troops.
[00:58:01.777 --> 00:58:04.559]  Yeah, soon they'll have the robots and the drones, they won't need you.
[00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:07.962]  But here it is, News on 6.
[00:58:07.962 --> 00:58:11.685]  Woman sues City of Tulsa for cutting down her edible garden.
[00:58:11.685 --> 00:58:15.268]  They said you're not allowed to have it in the front or the back, and it was a very pretty little garden.
[00:58:15.268 --> 00:58:16.349]  I've seen the newscast.
[00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:18.570]  This is up at Infowars.com.
[00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:19.250]  We're linked to it.
[00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:21.251]  But, uh, Woman Sues City.
[00:58:21.251 --> 00:58:29.273]  And remember three years ago, it was the city council tried to pass a law in Tulsa that you have to have an inspection to make sure there's not marijuana.
[00:58:29.273 --> 00:58:32.153]  Because, see, you're guilty until proven slave.
[00:58:32.153 --> 00:58:34.874]  You don't let prisoners have a garden in America.
[00:58:34.874 --> 00:58:38.735]  Well, now they just send code enforcers in, and they chop it down and give you a bill.
[00:58:43.172 --> 00:58:50.316]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.316 --> 00:58:54.858]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.858 --> 00:58:59.200]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:04.943]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.943 --> 00:59:10.246]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.566 --> 00:59:11.387]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.387 --> 00:59:14.972]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.972 --> 00:59:18.897]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.897 --> 00:59:19.678]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.678 --> 00:59:22.462]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.462 --> 00:59:25.807]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.107 --> 00:59:31.049]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.049 --> 00:59:36.110]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:40.272]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.272 --> 00:59:42.072]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.072 --> 00:59:46.674]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:53.433 --> 00:59:55.834]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.834 --> 01:00:05.179]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.179 --> 01:00:06.500]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.261]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.261 --> 01:00:10.022]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.022 --> 01:00:11.603]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.603 --> 01:00:13.163]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.163 --> 01:00:17.346]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.346 --> 01:00:21.408]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:47.774]  There are really three rails in society, but the middle rail is a no-man's land of lukewarm foolishness.
[01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:52.815]  There is conscience, calculated, organized evil.
[01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:55.656]  That's one rail.
[01:00:55.656 --> 01:00:59.297]  And there is uncoordinated good in the world.
[01:00:59.297 --> 01:01:01.438]  Good is very rarely coordinated.
[01:01:02.731 --> 01:01:23.090]  And every good action, every loving action, every strong action, every action of courage, when you don't back down from being lied to, when you're lied to you confront somebody, when you don't back down from somebody trying to intimidate you, when you don't back down when someone tries to bully you, when you help
[01:01:24.025 --> 01:01:45.610]  Those that are weak, when you make yourself look deeper into the more complex meanings, when you build up strong things, when you work hard, when you invent things, when you appreciate the world, when you appreciate beauty, when you recognize good from evil, and then make the right choice, it makes the world a better place.
[01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:51.892]  Not the Illuminati thousand points of light, but seven billion points of light, bringing light to the world.
[01:01:52.927 --> 01:01:54.268]  People say, that's Illuminati.
[01:01:54.268 --> 01:02:01.154]  No, the Illuminati, the globalists, take every archetype that's real and good, and they expropriate it.
[01:02:01.154 --> 01:02:03.175]  They've expropriated our American flag.
[01:02:03.175 --> 01:02:09.841]  They've expropriated all of our sacred ideas, everything that's written on our heart.
[01:02:09.841 --> 01:02:12.303]  And they have set up their world government.
[01:02:12.303 --> 01:02:13.784]  It's not complete yet, though.
[01:02:13.784 --> 01:02:15.565]  They have to eradicate the common sense.
[01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:19.649]  They have to eradicate the private property, the parental rights, the Second Amendment.
[01:02:21.015 --> 01:02:34.859]  They have to eradicate all the major religions that aren't into devil worship because they don't fit in to that larger system of total control where the state and the globalist and the petty hype system is God.
[01:02:34.859 --> 01:02:47.883]  The New World Order's greatest crime is attacking the innocents and seeking to dumb down people and keep them from learning true knowledge.
[01:02:47.883 --> 01:02:50.224]  It's all a riddle wrapped in an enigma.
[01:02:53.971 --> 01:03:03.553]  We've got Daniel Estelin coming up in the next segment with some breaking news.
[01:03:03.553 --> 01:03:09.734]  And we're going to look at this report here out of the Washington Post today.
[01:03:09.734 --> 01:03:12.675]  Avoiding a Global Catastrophe by Larry Summers.
[01:03:12.675 --> 01:03:16.436]  This is the guy that helped get rid of Glass-Steagall cell derivatives, not just here, but worldwide.
[01:03:16.436 --> 01:03:18.716]  We're going to get into him.
[01:03:18.716 --> 01:03:19.536]  G20 Summit.
[01:03:19.536 --> 01:03:21.897]  Barroso Blames Eurozone Crisis on U.S.
[01:03:21.897 --> 01:03:22.157]  Banks.
[01:03:24.124 --> 01:03:26.225]  Well, it's the same banks that run Europe run the U.S.
[01:03:26.225 --> 01:03:29.187]  It's like the left hand is blaming the right hand.
[01:03:29.187 --> 01:03:30.908]  In a way, it's true.
[01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:31.708]  But it's a spin.
[01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:34.690]  We're going to be going over all of that.
[01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:39.032]  The big news here, obviously, McCain urges U.S.-led war against Syria.
[01:03:39.032 --> 01:03:42.294]  Syria, Iran, Russia, and China plan joint war games.
[01:03:42.294 --> 01:03:44.575]  Iran News Agency reports.
[01:03:44.575 --> 01:03:50.558]  There's also reports out that Putin lectured Obama at the meeting yesterday.
[01:03:50.558 --> 01:03:51.999]  They were both very, very tense.
[01:03:52.955 --> 01:03:55.397]  The Weekly Standard is reporting.
[01:03:55.397 --> 01:03:57.058]  There's video of that.
[01:03:57.058 --> 01:03:58.979]  Looks like Putin got in his face.
[01:03:58.979 --> 01:04:02.482]  And again, Putin is a globalist, but he wants his own New World Order.
[01:04:02.482 --> 01:04:07.786]  Putin is a KGB guy, FSB guy.
[01:04:07.786 --> 01:04:12.969]  But all that's happening is, that's one group competing with the other group.
[01:04:12.969 --> 01:04:18.753]  The big, dominant group that
[01:04:20.117 --> 01:04:24.460]  That is, the most virulent is the group that's hijacked the West.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.282]  It's not Putin.
[01:04:26.282 --> 01:04:32.907]  It's not the Chicoms that are putting drones in the skies and cancer viruses in our vaccines.
[01:04:32.907 --> 01:04:33.487]  Well, cancer...
[01:04:34.847 --> 01:04:39.152]  China actually works with the globalists to do a lot of that.
[01:04:39.152 --> 01:04:41.635]  They made that deal back in the 70s to carry out eugenics.
[01:04:41.635 --> 01:04:43.957]  And we'll get into that with Daniel Esselstyn as well.
[01:04:43.957 --> 01:04:47.301]  He's going to give us some amazing breaking information straight ahead.
[01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:50.465]  Best-selling author and researcher Daniel Esselstyn is scheduled straight ahead.

[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.642]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.078 --> 01:08:27.321]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, and broadcasting worldwide.
[01:08:27.321 --> 01:08:29.804]  Blasting out on XM-166.
[01:08:29.804 --> 01:08:32.126]  Over 100 AM and FM affiliates.
[01:08:32.126 --> 01:08:38.133]  Shymalcast at PrisonPlanet.tv with video feeds and on the audio streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:40.509 --> 01:08:43.692]  Joining us for the full hour is Daniel Estelin.
[01:08:43.692 --> 01:08:48.256]  He is a best-selling author, researcher who lives in Spain.
[01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:51.699]  His true story of the Bilderberg Group is an international bestseller.
[01:08:51.699 --> 01:08:58.646]  I forget how many countries it's been published in and it's also available on a trying day right here in the United States.
[01:08:58.646 --> 01:09:05.712]  Daniel Estelin, E-S-T-U-L-I-N dot com, danielestelin.com is his excellent website.
[01:09:07.153 --> 01:09:09.054]  Daniel is a hard guy to get on.
[01:09:09.054 --> 01:09:09.914]  He's very busy.
[01:09:09.914 --> 01:09:14.876]  There's a lot of interviews in Europe and the national TV shows of all the big countries.
[01:09:14.876 --> 01:09:18.497]  He can't travel a lot because they try to block him flying to the U.S.
[01:09:18.497 --> 01:09:21.499]  They wouldn't let him in last time to be on Ventura's TV show.
[01:09:21.499 --> 01:09:21.959]  He had to come...
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.562]  A week later, Ventura confirmed that it happened.
[01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.985]  He's had death threats, you name it.
[01:09:28.985 --> 01:09:32.388]  And I've never had him contact us and say, hey, I want to come on.
[01:09:32.388 --> 01:09:33.529]  I got breaking news.
[01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:39.013]  So it must be big if Daniel Esselstyn is wanting to talk to people in North America.
[01:09:39.013 --> 01:09:42.156]  We're also listened to, obviously, around the world.
[01:09:42.156 --> 01:09:45.419]  And I'm just now discovering during the break when we got him on what it's about.
[01:09:45.419 --> 01:09:49.322]  And it's the latest from Milderberg, because you always learn a few weeks later
[01:09:50.163 --> 01:09:58.787]  After the meeting is when you get the really good leaks, and it ties into exactly what he predicted two, three weeks ago, daring it with his initial sources.
[01:09:58.787 --> 01:10:00.908]  So this is a bird's eye view into the globalists.
[01:10:00.908 --> 01:10:12.513]  But we have Larry Summers, who helped engineer so much of this, you know, the head guy for Clinton, openly saying that we could have a total collapse now if you don't give total power to the banksters.
[01:10:12.513 --> 01:10:15.094]  That's in an article titled Avoiding the Global Catastrophe.
[01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:20.541]  We've got Syria, Iran, Russia and China planning joint war games.
[01:10:20.541 --> 01:10:24.446]  Iran News Agency reports McCain says prepare for boots on the ground.
[01:10:24.446 --> 01:10:26.589]  They're calling for war in Syria.
[01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:32.417]  The West is using Al-Qaeda in Libya to take over and now Syria and admitting it.
[01:10:33.123 --> 01:10:45.828]  I know Bilderberg last year was upset from our sources that it was even in the LA Times that, yes, the West uses Al-Qaeda, because that messes up their system of using them to take our liberties, the imaginary or semi-imaginary threat.
[01:10:45.828 --> 01:10:52.411]  So joining us to break all this down is Daniel Estelin, joining us from Spain.
[01:10:52.411 --> 01:10:53.792]  You're in Spain right now, correct, Daniel?
[01:10:54.292 --> 01:11:02.158]  I'm in Madrid right now, but I'm not sure how long I'm going to be in Madrid or Spain, because Spain is going to hell in a handbasket trap.
[01:11:02.158 --> 01:11:06.842]  You can see the systemic collapse in Spain over the past six months.
[01:11:06.842 --> 01:11:09.304]  It's been tremendous, because I live here.
[01:11:09.304 --> 01:11:12.026]  I can tell you what I've been witnessing over the past six months.
[01:11:13.587 --> 01:11:14.027]  I don't know.
[01:11:36.817 --> 01:11:45.086]  Let's just start, because again, this is important information, with the elections in Greece, which is, again, Greece obviously was on the agenda at Bilderberg this year.
[01:11:45.086 --> 01:11:58.801]  But, you know, regardless of what we're seeing in the mainstream press, regardless of consequences, the European Union, the largest economy in the world, is now suffering under the weight of two, not one, but two
[01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:10.229]  Traumatic crisis striking simultaneously, and these two crises striking simultaneously, literally mean doom for the United States and for the Western world.
[01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:11.330]  Trauma, number one.
[01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:13.812]  Europe's governments are in big trouble.
[01:12:13.812 --> 01:12:19.556]  Debt is out of control, tax revenues are plunging, and interest rates and interest costs are surging.
[01:12:19.556 --> 01:12:23.619]  And these are obviously the things that Bilderbergers were very, very concerned about.
[01:12:23.619 --> 01:12:26.221]  The elections in Greece have not changed that at all.
[01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:27.302]  I don't think so.
[01:12:45.939 --> 01:12:46.900]  We're good to go.
[01:13:12.578 --> 01:13:13.159]  We're good.
[01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:30.358]  But that's not all.
[01:13:30.358 --> 01:13:58.384]  As I just found out from our sources, one of the concerns of the Bilderberg meeting was that they're concerned not only of these big countries, as they call southern European nations and Ireland, but also they're concerned with countries such as France's debt is almost as large as Italy at almost two trillion, and Germany, which is the motor of the European economy and supposedly the only nation that can save the world from oblivion, its debt is actually larger than it
[01:13:58.524 --> 01:13:59.925]  We're good to go.
[01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:25.708]  Thank you.
[01:14:36.584 --> 01:14:46.448]  Now, I know you have some amazing sources inside Bilderberg, so I've got some questions along those lines, but every country, Greece, Spain, people ask, why is it called the PIGS?
[01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:51.990]  You've got Portugal, you've got Italy, you've got Greece, Spain, that spells out PIGS.
[01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:58.312]  And as the megabanks bail their own debt out, they have the media push and say that most of the debt
[01:14:59.349 --> 01:15:02.790]  Was actually the populations, but we've done those numbers.
[01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:13.314]  In some countries, it's over 90% of the debt that they're being told is their debt, is actually Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, their European divisions.
[01:15:13.314 --> 01:15:20.657]  And Barroso, who's a big New World Order guy, as you know, he came out, the London Guardian, and blamed US banks.
[01:15:20.657 --> 01:15:22.517]  But that's like blaming your other hand.
[01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:25.598]  So we're getting down towards the endgame.
[01:15:25.598 --> 01:15:27.159]  No matter how many bailouts there are,
[01:15:28.564 --> 01:15:29.685]  They always need more.
[01:15:29.685 --> 01:15:40.670]  I want to explain something about this whole, you know, there's a lot of, a great deal of debt buying going around, in Europe especially, and a lot of people are asking, are wondering, what does that do?
[01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:50.675]  Now the thing is that the banks are buying it because the idea is to bankrupt nations, it's not to save the world from destruction, it's actually to destroy the nations.
[01:15:50.675 --> 01:15:55.858]  This is the old Venetian game in having your adversary go so far in debt
[01:15:56.338 --> 01:15:57.259]  We're good to go.
[01:16:20.211 --> 01:16:21.291]  We're good to go.
[01:16:48.039 --> 01:16:55.982]  Let me ask you this, why does Bilderberg want a post-industrial world?
[01:16:55.982 --> 01:16:58.702]  Why do they want to reduce the population?
[01:16:58.702 --> 01:17:06.445]  Because they're meeting right now in Rio, and they're saying they want a post-industrial world, and here's AFP, Women March in Rio.
[01:17:07.526 --> 01:17:11.409]  To protest a green economy because it's not really a green economy.
[01:17:11.409 --> 01:17:17.493]  Why is Bilderberg so obsessed with reducing population and wrecking economies, Daniel Estelin?
[01:17:17.493 --> 01:17:26.279]  Well, you know, Alex, again, it goes back to the, you know, we're living on a very small planet of 7 billion people with natural, limited natural resources.
[01:17:26.279 --> 01:17:29.802]  In a generation, we're going to get to 10, 11 billion, 15, 20, 40.
[01:17:29.802 --> 01:17:33.384]  It's going to get to the point there's simply not enough food.
[01:17:33.784 --> 01:17:34.425]  We're good to go.
[01:17:58.561 --> 01:17:59.422]  We're good to go.
[01:18:23.417 --> 01:18:25.358]  Post-Industrial Age, as you said.
[01:18:25.358 --> 01:18:36.125]  You know, you and I talked about this after the 2006 Bilderberg meeting in Canada, when we were working on the Endgame documentary, and you were interviewing me for that documentary.
[01:18:36.125 --> 01:18:49.473]  We were talking about it, so if people haven't seen Endgame, go back and see what Alex Jones did back in 2006, so that people can understand that this isn't some nonsense or some conspiracy freak.
[01:18:49.473 --> 01:18:50.693]  This is real.
[01:18:50.693 --> 01:18:51.574]  And what they're doing is,
[01:18:51.954 --> 01:19:11.302]  They're destroying nation-state republics and creating this World Company Limited, a concept which was first brought up at the 1968 Bilderberg Conference in Canada by none other than George Ball of Lehman Brothers, who announced the project to build this World Company.
[01:19:11.302 --> 01:19:12.183]  And the idea is
[01:19:12.763 --> 01:19:18.126]  That nation states of the time, this is 1968, they're outmoded.
[01:19:18.126 --> 01:19:20.508]  They're an archaic form of government.
[01:19:20.508 --> 01:19:23.429]  In a Malthusian world, they can't be relied on.
[01:19:23.429 --> 01:19:31.714]  They tend to believe that the resources in their countries, most countries, belong to the people who run the world, the Rockefellers and company.
[01:19:31.714 --> 01:19:39.619]  And so what they've done, in order to control the natural resources, they created a new form of government that decided in a corporation.
[01:19:39.619 --> 01:19:41.620]  So that's what the World Corporation is.
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:44.301]  That's right, and you don't have a vote in it.
[01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:49.402]  That's why in the 1974 network, they call Howard Beal in and explain it all to him.
[01:19:49.402 --> 01:19:55.965]  When we come back, I want to continue with the latest info you've got from inside Bilderberg, Daniel Estelin, danielestelin.com.
[01:19:55.965 --> 01:20:00.046]  We'll also look at all the military battle lines being drawn right now.
[01:20:00.726 --> 01:20:06.230]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:08.652]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:20:08.652 --> 01:20:17.738]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:20:17.738 --> 01:20:21.181]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:22.882]  There's no priming required.
[01:20:22.882 --> 01:20:25.144]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:20:25.144 --> 01:20:27.665]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:20:28.706 --> 01:20:30.227]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:20:30.227 --> 01:20:31.648]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:20:31.648 --> 01:20:34.831]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:38.214]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:20:38.214 --> 01:20:40.115]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:20:40.115 --> 01:20:42.357]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:20:42.357 --> 01:20:45.079]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:20:45.079 --> 01:20:46.660]  It's what my family uses.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:49.983]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:20:49.983 --> 01:20:52.525]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout,
[01:20:52.665 --> 01:20:55.806]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWars.com.

[01:21:00.628 --> 01:21:03.369]  Survival is not about the end of the world.
[01:21:03.369 --> 01:21:07.430]  It's not about a hypothetical plane crash or the latest violent storm.
[01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:15.734]  Survival is about the satisfaction of knowing you can take care of yourself and your family in any situation, anytime, anywhere.
[01:21:15.734 --> 01:21:18.294]  CampingSurvival.com was started in 1956.
[01:21:19.775 --> 01:21:22.858]  No, not the dot-com part, the survival part.

[01:21:32.347 --> 01:21:37.352]  We look around to make sure we have the lowest prices, and CampingSurvival.com is
[01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:42.634]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:21:42.634 --> 01:21:44.395]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:22:08.039 --> 01:22:17.003]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:22:17.003 --> 01:22:21.925]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:24:17.063 --> 01:24:25.265]  I'm not trying to shoot our guest horn, but he really has had a dramatic effect on the landscape and has amazing sources.
[01:24:25.265 --> 01:24:34.907]  Vanity Fair, the Wall Street Journal of Italy, you name it, have pointed out just recently that he's one of the top researchers in this area.
[01:24:34.907 --> 01:24:38.268]  And of course, a few years ago, I'll ask him about this before he leaves us.
[01:24:39.512 --> 01:24:42.993]  At the end of the hour, Fidel Castro invited him to Cuba.
[01:24:42.993 --> 01:24:56.338]  And again, regardless of what you think of Castro's political bent, here is Fidel Castro, in fact a photo on screen, inviting Daniel Estelin, whose books he reads, to Cuba.
[01:24:56.338 --> 01:25:00.820]  So it just shows that he knows who runs the world, these banksters.
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:03.681]  So we'll be talking more with Daniel about that.
[01:25:03.681 --> 01:25:05.041]  This is a short segment, Daniel.
[01:25:06.582 --> 01:25:18.346]  I wanted to get into what's happening geopolitically, because the world is obviously, as it economically collapses by design, to consolidate, it's militarily, the battle lines are being drawn.
[01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:28.950]  I mean, Russia, it's not even really in our news, but it's all over European news, as you know, has said three times the last two months, Medvedev and Putin, we will nuke you if you keep moving missiles in.
[01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:30.151]  Now they're sending spitsnats.
[01:25:31.071 --> 01:25:38.664]  Special Forces and Marine Spetsnaz and ships into Syria, all sorts of high-tech weapons.
[01:25:38.664 --> 01:25:40.107]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:25:40.107 --> 01:25:43.973]  Daniel, what is your Bilderberg sources telling you on these fronts?
[01:25:45.489 --> 01:25:53.132]  Well, you know, the biggest Bill of Rights top headache in the foreseeable future continues to be Putin, and that's something that they've all agreed on.
[01:25:53.132 --> 01:26:03.476]  Key areas of concern for the secretive organization is Russia's opposition to war in Syria and Iran, be they in spite of humanitarian bombing or colored revolutions.
[01:26:03.476 --> 01:26:10.138]  Particular concern for Bill of Rights is Russia's insistence on maintaining state sovereignty intact.
[01:26:10.138 --> 01:26:14.240]  That's something that Putin has mentioned quite a few times, and that's something that the American media, at least,
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.801]  We're good to go.
[01:26:38.277 --> 01:26:38.598]  I think so.
[01:26:54.438 --> 01:26:55.518]  We're good to go.
[01:27:15.686 --> 01:27:37.228]  The Bilderbergers agree that an inflexible proposition could leave Russia out of many international future understandings for Syria, and I quote from one of the Bilderbergers, they said, Russia was completely left out of Libya, and they won't want to risk being shut out of Syria as well, said one high-ranking US diplomat attending the Bilderberg conference.
[01:27:37.228 --> 01:27:38.449]  Now, Bilderberg is convinced
[01:27:38.949 --> 01:27:39.429]  Incredible!
[01:28:07.947 --> 01:28:12.232]  Shifting gears, and I've got Aaron Dyke, since you mentioned it earlier, trying to find it.
[01:28:12.232 --> 01:28:14.274]  It's almost a three hour film.
[01:28:14.274 --> 01:28:20.661]  In 2006, almost two years before the housing collapse began, and no one was talking about it,
[01:28:21.744 --> 01:28:44.759]  Your sources said that in that meeting, because I talked to you that night right after it ended, you hadn't had any sleep in over two days because you'd flown in from Spain, that, and it's in endgame, that they were going to implode the housing market and begin a recession that would lead to global depression, the derivatives, the imploding economy, Europe, then the United States.
[01:28:44.759 --> 01:28:46.420]  So you lay it all out in endgame.
[01:28:47.602 --> 01:28:48.784]  And there it is.
[01:28:48.784 --> 01:28:54.437]  All these crises that they act like are just now starting and the globalists have a solution to them.
[01:28:54.437 --> 01:28:57.023]  We have them on record engineering them.
[01:28:58.336 --> 01:29:13.493]  That's one of the reasons why we get the Wall Street Italy, which is not exactly a slouch, giving me front page coverage, an entire page, talking about my 2012 Bilderberg report, and saying, as you just mentioned, one of the few people who actually got the inside information from the people at the meeting.
[01:29:13.493 --> 01:29:18.839]  These are people who are very, very serious about what's going on, and again, Bilderberg has a lot of opposition.
[01:29:19.179 --> 01:29:24.801]  I'll tell you what, long segment, sorry to interrupt, long segment, stay there.
[01:29:24.801 --> 01:29:30.964]  Tell us about opposition to Bilderberg, inside, a lot more, what's happening in Italy, back in just a few minutes.
[01:29:49.895 --> 01:29:53.818]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.818 --> 01:30:00.643]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.643 --> 01:30:01.944]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:01.944 --> 01:30:07.528]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:07.528 --> 01:30:12.551]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:12.551 --> 01:30:17.575]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:30:18.115 --> 01:30:23.341]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:23.341 --> 01:30:30.449]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:30.449 --> 01:30:31.570]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:37.937]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:38.257 --> 01:30:41.440]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.661]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:43.661 --> 01:30:44.602]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:44.602 --> 01:30:45.002]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:45.002 --> 01:30:48.245]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:48.245 --> 01:30:49.966]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:01.294 --> 01:31:16.763]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:16.763 --> 01:31:21.466]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:21.466 --> 01:31:25.528]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:31:26.127 --> 01:31:34.210]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your Silver Solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:34.210 --> 01:31:42.174]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:42.174 --> 01:31:51.758]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lung System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lung System works.

[01:32:00.184 --> 01:32:04.627]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoods Direct.
[01:32:04.627 --> 01:32:08.310]  As a listener, you know why you need to have a supply of the best affordable food on the planet.

[01:32:14.974 --> 01:32:16.575]  Your greatest dependency.

[01:33:21.607 --> 01:33:23.991]  Okay, we did dig out the clip.
[01:33:23.991 --> 01:33:28.219]  This is from Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:33:28.219 --> 01:33:32.707]  I also then updated it in my Obama Deception film of almost four years ago.
[01:33:34.381 --> 01:33:45.324]  And this is Daniel Estillan in the hotel lounge at around 11 o'clock at night with Jim Tucker as they're exchanging notes from their sources.
[01:33:45.324 --> 01:33:49.245]  I mean, this shows the power the Bilderberg Group has.
[01:33:49.245 --> 01:33:50.846]  Are they the absolute rulers?
[01:33:50.846 --> 01:34:02.009]  No, but they're as high as it gets in this Atlantic-European-US-England alliance, but not of our countries, of the global bankers that have hijacked us and conquered us.
[01:34:02.589 --> 01:34:09.215]  And are trying to leverage our military, our tax money, our science against the rest of the world.
[01:34:09.215 --> 01:34:11.638]  Does that mean Russia and China are good guys?
[01:34:11.638 --> 01:34:12.759]  No!
[01:34:12.759 --> 01:34:19.225]  It simply means that we are under the control of the most vicious group who want total extermination.
[01:34:19.225 --> 01:34:22.088]  I mean, Putin pays people to get married and have kids.
[01:34:22.088 --> 01:34:23.689]  Here, they don't want you to.
[01:34:23.689 --> 01:34:25.271]  Again, it's a different group.
[01:34:27.313 --> 01:34:30.774]  Again, the Chinese, the Russians, they're not the ones taking over the U.S.
[01:34:30.774 --> 01:34:33.796]  The Chinese are, to a certain extent, they're allied with the globalists more.
[01:34:33.796 --> 01:34:37.477]  But I'll get Daniel's sources on that and see if he agrees with that statement.
[01:34:37.477 --> 01:34:42.779]  We're going to get into what he was saying in Europe and then in the military situation in a moment, where he left off in Italy.
[01:34:42.779 --> 01:34:47.581]  But first, here's that clip from Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:50.762]  By the way, it's free online if you want to watch it.
[01:34:50.762 --> 01:34:52.363]  It's a very important film.
[01:34:52.363 --> 01:34:52.723]  Here it is.
[01:34:54.793 --> 01:35:01.802]  Well, one of the things that, you know, we're getting from this morning and this afternoon's conference, this morning's conference was about the energy crisis, the press of war.
[01:35:01.802 --> 01:35:11.054]  The afternoon conference, which started about 4 o'clock, 4-4-30, they were talking about one of the American delegates, I wasn't told who exactly it was, was talking about the
[01:35:12.396 --> 01:35:18.360]  The concern that the American citizens have had with the housing prices going down, so they're not investing that money.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.143]  So what they needed to do is they needed to create the illusion that everything is going well.
[01:35:22.143 --> 01:35:26.687]  So what they're going to do over the next year, year and a half, is to bring the market back up to 1998, 1999 levels.
[01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:31.310]  They're going to get all the suckers to invest whatever little money they have left over.
[01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:33.832]  And that's when they're going to make the economy.
[01:35:34.913 --> 01:35:35.574]  Bottom dropout.
[01:35:35.574 --> 01:35:49.546]  They need to destroy the economy because as we're running out of oil, when people don't travel, at least that's what they're saying, when people don't travel, when people don't have money, they don't travel, they don't spend any money, which means you don't waste a lot of oil and natural gas.
[01:35:49.546 --> 01:35:50.848]  That's the afternoon's conversation.
[01:35:52.529 --> 01:35:53.710]  So you have the sources?
[01:35:53.710 --> 01:35:56.571]  Well, actually there are two people who are members of the Bill of Rights Club.
[01:35:56.571 --> 01:35:58.312]  Okay, that's good.
[01:35:58.312 --> 01:36:02.194]  And again, that's a really bad internet clip, just the first one we could find.
[01:36:02.194 --> 01:36:08.716]  There's higher quality ones available online of Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:08.716 --> 01:36:16.700]  But there is that clip, and you go on repeatedly in the film to just predict everything that's going to unfold.
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:17.801]  Let's continue now.
[01:36:17.801 --> 01:36:20.242]  Tell us what they're planning now.
[01:36:21.102 --> 01:36:22.323]  to do to the economy.
[01:36:22.323 --> 01:36:34.955]  You had left off with the fact that there's people within Bilderberg that don't like what's happening and that a lot of the nationalistic structures that are left are finally realizing that the New World Order is going to destroy their countries.
[01:36:34.955 --> 01:36:35.516]  Please continue.
[01:36:36.428 --> 01:36:40.590]  Well, I want to mention, just comment on what you said about the Chinese taking over the United States.
[01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:47.092]  You know, one of the key conclusions from the Olympic meeting is that the United States will manipulate the fall of the U.S.
[01:36:47.092 --> 01:36:49.693]  dollar in value against the Chinese yuan.
[01:36:49.693 --> 01:36:54.535]  Now, the thinking behind it is that a devalued dollar will inflate American debt
[01:36:55.115 --> 01:36:55.615]  We're good to go.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:20.301]  We're good to go.
[01:37:40.274 --> 01:37:46.557]  We've been financed by the Rockefeller Corporation, by the Ford Corporation for many, many years.
[01:37:46.557 --> 01:37:48.618]  Now, collusion between the U.S.
[01:37:48.618 --> 01:37:52.259]  government and the Chinese government is in progress.
[01:37:52.259 --> 01:38:01.123]  Now, you would think, Alex, this should be the front page news in the New York Times, in the Washington Post, in the Financial Times, in Time Magazine.
[01:38:01.123 --> 01:38:05.565]  Now, you will not see any of this because, needless to say, what we're seeing is the
[01:38:06.025 --> 01:38:34.027]  An active participant in the debate on the destruction of the American dollar at the expense of the Chinese currency, Yuan, are also involved in the Bilderberg meeting this year, who also participated in the collusion, Cheng Li, the Director of Research and Senior Fellow at John Thornton China Center with Brookings Institute, and of course, Kurt Rubin, the former Secretary of the Treasury and also co-chairman of the powerful Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:38:34.027 --> 01:38:35.288]  These are the individuals
[01:38:36.065 --> 01:38:36.366]  Yes sir.
[01:38:36.366 --> 01:38:37.968]  And paying 22 billion dollars of US tax money to move
[01:38:51.305 --> 01:38:54.949]  General Motors, Volt and Cadillac factories to China.
[01:38:54.949 --> 01:39:01.575]  So we don't just pay and then our traitorous globalist government has tax incentives to move our jobs to China.
[01:39:01.575 --> 01:39:05.158]  But now our government pays to shut us down.
[01:39:05.158 --> 01:39:13.186]  Let me ask you this detailed question because from my sources going back to 75 and those agreements with Nixon there is a strategic plan
[01:39:14.628 --> 01:39:15.008]  We're good.
[01:39:28.339 --> 01:39:36.762]  You know, basically, well, that Russia said no, and so the deal was made for the, quote, US, the bankers, to go with China.
[01:39:36.762 --> 01:39:41.344]  But then you have the double game of bases being set up around China.
[01:39:41.344 --> 01:39:45.805]  So I guess the globalists make deals with them, the carrot, but then have the stick.
[01:39:45.805 --> 01:39:48.567]  Does that mesh with your deep sources and research?
[01:39:48.567 --> 01:39:52.188]  What's the real lay of the land with the three power blocks, or four?
[01:39:52.648 --> 01:39:58.015]  But Europe and the United States and England and the Commonwealth is one or two, depending on how you look at it.
[01:39:58.015 --> 01:40:06.326]  Russia, and then of course what's happening with China, with Japan basically allied out there with the United States.
[01:40:06.326 --> 01:40:08.469]  What's the real power breakdown globally?
[01:40:09.495 --> 01:40:11.398]  Well, actually it's a very, very good question.
[01:40:11.398 --> 01:40:13.421]  You brought up a very interesting point.
[01:40:13.421 --> 01:40:24.878]  Now, if you have to go back, actually, to the fact that the critical breakdown which the Bilderbergers and their cohorts have been working on intensely, as you said, you know, going back to the 70s, actually since the 1960s,
[01:40:26.179 --> 01:40:26.580]  I don't know.
[01:40:45.103 --> 01:40:48.747]  Talking about these divisions between different countries and the Chinese and the Russians.
[01:40:48.747 --> 01:41:01.558]  Now, the European oligarchy was intent on breaking up the system that FDR had set up for post-World War II order that was premised on the decolonization of the planet.
[01:41:01.558 --> 01:41:08.244]  So what they've done, you know, the elite, they took a series of steps in the mid to late 1960s in Britain, for example,
[01:41:08.885 --> 01:41:09.525]  We're good to go.
[01:41:25.919 --> 01:41:26.559]  Okay.
[01:41:26.559 --> 01:41:29.520]  Another individual involved was, of course, George Shultz.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:39.284]  So you see, the stage was set to go from a system of fixed exchange rate that gave an advantage to real productive development and investment.
[01:41:39.284 --> 01:41:42.786]  And after 1971, everything went in favor of the speculators.
[01:41:42.786 --> 01:41:43.406]  And that again,
[01:41:44.026 --> 01:41:44.326]  I think so.
[01:41:59.958 --> 01:42:00.218]  I think so.
[01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:21.530]  We're good.
[01:42:36.557 --> 01:42:38.398]  How does Russia play into this?
[01:42:57.409 --> 01:42:59.411]  Well, you know, Putin is in an interesting position.
[01:42:59.411 --> 01:43:04.918]  On the one hand, the Russians and the Chinese, they obviously understand that, you know, they have to work together.
[01:43:04.918 --> 01:43:15.090]  But if they don't work together, you have, you know, the United States government, you have Bilderberg, you have, you know, London, you have all these nations actually going up against the interests of,
[01:43:15.971 --> 01:43:17.072]  Uh, of the Russians.
[01:43:17.072 --> 01:43:25.179]  But also, on the other hand, you know, the Russians are fully aware that the Chinese and the Americans are working together, you know, destroying the United States dollar.
[01:43:25.179 --> 01:43:31.245]  So what the Russians are actually doing, working on right now, is bilateral agreements with the Chinese.
[01:43:31.245 --> 01:43:36.430]  And of course, Russia's strength, you know, and they're playing to its strength, is its energy reserve.
[01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:41.134]  And that's one of the things they talked about at the meeting, is particularly concerned
[01:43:41.534 --> 01:43:49.100]  About this thing called South Stream Pipeline, which is a mega project of over 20 billion dollars.
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:44:05.554]  Now, South Stream Gas Pipeline is to transport Russian natural gas under the Black Sea to the southern part of the European Union through Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, and Slovakia, and then on to Italy and Austria, supplying over 60 billion cubic meters of gas
[01:44:06.074 --> 01:44:06.374]  I don't know.
[01:44:27.108 --> 01:44:28.428]  We're good to go.
[01:44:54.673 --> 01:45:04.962]  Well, if you look at what the West has been doing in Pakistan, is driving Pakistan, who's hated the Russians and the Chinese to a certain extent, into the arms of the Chinese.
[01:45:04.962 --> 01:45:10.647]  So again, you see a double game where Kissinger and these people actually have more investments in China.
[01:45:10.647 --> 01:45:14.770]  So in the final equation, they just want to have it all balanced out.
[01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:18.593]  And in the final equation, sell the United States down the river.
[01:45:18.593 --> 01:45:19.734]  As you said, we're just more
[01:45:20.635 --> 01:45:22.376]  More real estate to them.
[01:45:22.376 --> 01:45:24.257]  How are things going for them?
[01:45:24.257 --> 01:45:25.457]  Because the break interrupted you.
[01:45:25.457 --> 01:45:27.338]  We never went back to Italy.
[01:45:27.338 --> 01:45:30.159]  I mean, how are things going for the banksters?
[01:45:30.159 --> 01:45:32.601]  How are things going for the money changers?
[01:45:32.601 --> 01:45:35.382]  Are things going well or are they going badly?
[01:45:35.922 --> 01:45:38.523]  Well, things are not going as well as they had hoped.
[01:45:38.523 --> 01:45:42.044]  Obviously, Europe is in a systemic breakdown.
[01:45:42.044 --> 01:45:45.045]  The United States is in a terrible situation.
[01:45:45.045 --> 01:45:57.990]  You have all these nations, such as Russia, which allegedly were almost subjugated back in the 1990s with that alcoholic usurper by the name of Yeltsin, and now Putin steps in and he turns the whole thing around and he basically
[01:45:58.610 --> 01:45:59.491]  I don't think so.
[01:46:25.113 --> 01:46:25.734]  I don't think so.
[01:46:41.313 --> 01:47:00.945]  And while Bill Clinton continues to finance Kasparov's United Civil Front in hopes of stirring up trouble in Russia, the secretive cabal is out looking for wiser and smarter and more charismatic figures to give Putin a run for his money and they're going to have a hell of a hard time doing this because Putin is a very, very, very, very difficult nut to break.
[01:47:00.945 --> 01:47:04.427]  Now, going to Italy, I don't know how much time we have, but just a few words about that.
[01:47:05.027 --> 01:47:06.709]  Italy is not Spain.
[01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:08.712]  Spain is being wiped out.
[01:47:08.712 --> 01:47:10.955]  It's actually, you know, it's being given up for dead.
[01:47:10.955 --> 01:47:12.677]  That's what Bill Lindbergh has agreed on.
[01:47:12.677 --> 01:47:19.645]  Now, Italy is in a much better situation because, unlike Spain, Italy has never had much of a real estate bubble.
[01:47:19.645 --> 01:47:23.190]  Second of all, Italy, unlike Spain, has very little private debt.
[01:47:24.025 --> 01:47:38.532]  And also, Italy is home to the Venetian Black Nobility and its far-reaching first-rate banking apparatus, stretching back almost 750 years, as well as hundreds of first-rate companies with secure niches in the world's export markets.
[01:47:38.532 --> 01:47:47.917]  And most of these companies, they form an important part of some of the world's most powerful secret societies and private organizations, such as Buildable Group.
[01:47:47.917 --> 01:47:50.718]  Then, of course, there's another very important link in Italy.
[01:47:50.718 --> 01:47:53.380]  There's an interlocked relationship between the mafia,
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:54.281]  We're good.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:12.561]  I don't think so.
[01:48:26.246 --> 01:48:29.128]  What about domestic things here in the U.S.?
[01:48:29.128 --> 01:48:30.629]  Tidbits.
[01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:33.731]  I see the media swinging towards Mitt Romney.
[01:48:33.731 --> 01:48:37.253]  I see the left establishment coming out against Obama.
[01:48:37.253 --> 01:48:39.695]  I see a lot of kingmakers drifting towards him.
[01:48:39.695 --> 01:48:45.179]  I see Bloomberg coming out and doing a purposed leak, saying he's endorsing Romney.
[01:48:45.179 --> 01:48:48.801]  Did you get any word on who the Bilderberg Group wants for the U.S.
[01:48:48.801 --> 01:48:49.522]  elections?
[01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:52.524]  Because our information looks like they're leaning towards Romney.
[01:48:53.476 --> 01:48:54.897]  You know, I'd say the same thing.
[01:48:54.897 --> 01:49:05.206]  I don't have a lot of information on that, but from bits and pieces I have heard, that makes a lot of sense, because Obama, you know, he's spent, you know, he's good.
[01:49:05.206 --> 01:49:08.069]  You know, there's just too many people that figured his game.
[01:49:08.069 --> 01:49:11.692]  And if they figured out Obama's game, he's no good to the Build-A-Burners.
[01:49:11.692 --> 01:49:14.074]  So they need somebody else with fresh taste, with fresh ideas.
[01:49:14.534 --> 01:49:22.461]  So I see quite likely, because I also see a lot of positioning behind the scenes.
[01:49:22.461 --> 01:49:30.529]  There's a lot in the intelligent world, in the intelligence world, there's a lot of consistently games being played and systems being tested.
[01:49:31.029 --> 01:49:31.710]  We're good to go.
[01:49:50.985 --> 01:49:54.787]  Obama is going to be the candidate, and it's his presidency to lose.
[01:49:54.787 --> 01:50:00.490]  He won the presidency, he didn't do as well as they had hoped, now four years later, a new man is going to come in.
[01:50:00.490 --> 01:50:03.591]  Again, that all depends on Romney, it doesn't depend on Bilderberg.
[01:50:03.591 --> 01:50:18.438]  They can pick a candidate, you know, they got two, you know, two horses in this race, the Democrats and the Republicans, but it's up to Romney to actually make a plane and convince, you know, quote-unquote, the Americans that he is going to be the leader to lead America, you know, through the difficult period.
[01:50:19.252 --> 01:50:22.827]  So at a certain point, as long as they own both the candidates, they'll let them battle it out.
[01:50:23.626 --> 01:50:25.287]  Exactly, they always own the candidate.
[01:50:25.287 --> 01:50:27.969]  You know, the game plan has been set.
[01:50:27.969 --> 01:50:29.129]  You know, the pieces are in place.
[01:50:29.129 --> 01:50:35.013]  It's just a question of... There's always, you know, 10-15% unknown factors of what could actually happen.
[01:50:35.013 --> 01:50:43.878]  You know, we talked about this scenario, you know, back in 2006-2007 when there was plans to at least talk about assassinating Ron Paul.
[01:50:43.878 --> 01:50:48.361]  And, you know, the trial balloon at the time was what would happen if this were to happen.
[01:50:48.361 --> 01:50:49.681]  That thankfully didn't happen.
[01:50:49.681 --> 01:50:52.323]  But the point is that these are the kinds of games that they play.
[01:50:52.563 --> 01:51:00.948]  Hold on, I want to hear in our final segment what you're getting at with that amazing information with Daniel Estelin, danielestelin.com.
[01:51:00.948 --> 01:51:02.249]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.249 --> 01:51:07.833]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.833 --> 01:51:12.856]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.856 --> 01:51:17.879]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.419 --> 01:51:23.643]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:25.964]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:25.964 --> 01:51:30.767]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.767 --> 01:51:31.888]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.888 --> 01:51:34.950]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:38.573]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.573 --> 01:51:41.755]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:49.982 --> 01:51:57.615]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.615 --> 01:51:59.998]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:09.432 --> 01:54:19.097]  Alright, he's with us about five minutes into the next hour, then a big news blitz ahead of a guest joining us who's having his home taken, a World War II hero.
[01:54:19.097 --> 01:54:22.698]  Daniel, you were finishing up with Ron Paul, then I want to ask you about the U.S.
[01:54:22.698 --> 01:54:28.361]  economy briefly, and then a few years ago you got invited by Fidel Castro to Cuba.
[01:54:28.361 --> 01:54:29.402]  Tell us what that was like.
[01:54:29.402 --> 01:54:30.002]  You've got the floor.
[01:54:32.987 --> 01:54:36.890]  Yeah, I actually went to see him in August 2010, at the end of August.
[01:54:36.890 --> 01:54:37.651]  And he loved the book.
[01:54:37.651 --> 01:54:39.152]  He didn't know anything about it.
[01:54:39.152 --> 01:54:44.536]  I'm not sure whether he knew or built it, but he certainly understands the world politics and geopolitics.
[01:54:44.536 --> 01:54:45.417]  And he invited me to QI.
[01:54:45.417 --> 01:54:47.198]  I spent one week with him.
[01:54:47.198 --> 01:54:53.423]  We had a three-and-a-half hour meeting, which was divided into an hour-and-a-half meeting with him and I and other journalists.
[01:54:54.023 --> 01:54:54.864]  We're good to go.
[01:55:12.364 --> 01:55:13.125]  We're good to go.
[01:55:34.983 --> 01:55:35.223]  I think?
[01:56:08.406 --> 01:56:13.950]  Well, I know that early on the CIA worked with him, but then supposedly there was a falling out.
[01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:18.453]  Well, you know, there's obviously, you know, I can tell you one thing, he has tremendous security.
[01:56:18.453 --> 01:56:26.899]  And if I actually got in to see him, you know, I was first ten times over, obviously, you know, he had, I don't know, twenty, thirty bodyguards around him.
[01:56:26.899 --> 01:56:29.301]  But we actually sat down, you know, for our meeting.
[01:56:31.022 --> 01:56:33.703]  The atmosphere was very relaxed, very, you know, outgoing.
[01:56:33.703 --> 01:56:35.484]  And he's a very, very funny man.
[01:56:35.484 --> 01:56:44.188]  And, you know, after the meeting, they took me throughout the week that I was actually there to see the Chernobyl Center.
[01:56:44.188 --> 01:56:51.311]  One of the kids from the Soviet Union, from Ukraine, was there actually being nursed back to health.
[01:56:51.311 --> 01:56:52.711]  And over the past 20 years, over 20,000 kids
[01:56:54.512 --> 01:56:55.372]  We're good to go.
[01:57:19.252 --> 01:57:23.754]  Well, what's interesting is that he invited you there because he'd read your book.
[01:57:23.754 --> 01:57:25.354]  I saw that in Reuters everywhere.
[01:57:25.354 --> 01:57:31.056]  You know, that Fidel Castro's looking into the New World Order because it really is the real politics.
[01:57:31.056 --> 01:57:36.699]  Whether you like Castro or hate him or are indifferent, the fact is, this is real.
[01:57:36.699 --> 01:57:41.020]  There are shadowy banking cartels that are trying to govern our planet.
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:43.601]  They're trying to get a total world government.
[01:57:43.601 --> 01:57:45.042]  The question is, will we let them?
[01:57:45.922 --> 01:57:48.708]  Of all the ideologies, the globalists are the worst.
[01:57:48.708 --> 01:57:53.016]  They want global government, the end of the family, and mass extermination.
[01:57:53.016 --> 01:57:57.264]  They are like aliens from another planet come to kill us.
[01:57:58.072 --> 01:58:01.356]  Well, you know, if we're going to take our country, our country is back.
[01:58:01.356 --> 01:58:07.884]  We have to do it now before any more rights are taken and any more people disappear and before we lose all control.
[01:58:07.884 --> 01:58:15.514]  So we have to stand up, understand that this is real, understand this isn't some figment of imagination of some guy who writes a book.
[01:58:15.974 --> 01:58:16.515]  Stay there!
[01:58:16.515 --> 01:58:16.975]  Stay there!
[01:58:16.975 --> 01:58:18.076]  Stay there!

[01:59:21.641 --> 01:59:24.802]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds and wells.
[01:59:24.802 --> 01:59:28.203]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:59:28.203 --> 01:59:32.344]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:59:32.344 --> 01:59:35.065]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

[01:59:47.173 --> 01:59:48.475]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.475 --> 01:59:54.541]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.475 --> 02:00:10.298]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.298 --> 02:00:11.878]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.878 --> 02:00:13.819]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.819 --> 02:00:17.622]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.622 --> 02:00:21.684]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.958 --> 02:00:27.441]  All right, we're doing five more minutes with Daniel Estelin left over from the last hour.
[02:00:27.441 --> 02:00:31.104]  Finishing up, he's written non-fiction books that are best sellers.
[02:00:31.104 --> 02:00:36.087]  He's got a fiction, but he can put more reality in that than a regular book and get away with it.
[02:00:36.087 --> 02:00:38.309]  The Octopus Conspiracy is coming out in the U.S.
[02:00:38.309 --> 02:00:38.829]  in September.
[02:00:38.829 --> 02:00:41.231]  We're going to get him on about that in September.
[02:00:41.231 --> 02:00:44.073]  Look forward to carrying it at InfoWarshop.com.
[02:00:44.073 --> 02:00:46.334]  But Daniel, finishing up the point you were making.
[02:00:46.334 --> 02:00:48.916]  Yeah, you're speaking to the EU Parliament.
[02:00:48.916 --> 02:00:51.218]  You're, you know, you're not just going to visit with Fidel Castro.
[02:00:51.738 --> 02:00:54.301]  This information is really breaking through.
[02:00:54.301 --> 02:00:56.484]  That's why they never wanted to admit it existed.
[02:00:56.484 --> 02:01:08.918]  Because once you admit there's cabals running things and that presidents and prime ministers are puppets in the West, we could begin to have a real political debate and maybe get our power back, get our countries back.
[02:01:09.674 --> 02:01:11.955]  Well, you know, this is exactly what's happening.
[02:01:11.955 --> 02:01:24.121]  Now, the thing is that a lot of the Bilderbergers way back when, you know, when I wrote my first book in 2005 on True Story of the Bilderberg Group, you know, people were taking us for freaks, saying that this is nonsense, doesn't exist.
[02:01:24.121 --> 02:01:31.744]  Well, of course, okay, it does exist, but these people just are, you know, a pointless debating society, they don't really do any harm.
[02:01:31.744 --> 02:01:32.885]  That's what a lot of people were saying.
[02:01:32.885 --> 02:01:39.128]  And now we're getting mainstream publications, such as Vanity Fair in Spain, they gave me three pages.
[02:01:39.568 --> 02:01:43.731]  A couple of weeks ago, Wall Street Italy, you know, full-page coverage.
[02:01:43.731 --> 02:01:46.013]  We have Costa, we have European Parliament.
[02:01:46.013 --> 02:01:55.099]  Mario Borghese, one of the most important European parliamentarians, you know, he's always promoting me in the European Parliament, talking about Bilderberg, you covered that.
[02:01:55.499 --> 02:01:56.119]  I think so.
[02:02:12.987 --> 02:02:14.168]  Hold on, that's big!
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:29.860]  I don't
[02:02:48.356 --> 02:03:06.722]  People are not, the individual that I'm talking about, their last name is not Brockchild, but they're obviously a very high level of Brockchild Corporation in Europe, so they understand what's going on, besides some, you know, Joe Blow, Joe Sixpack, who doesn't know anything at all.
[02:03:06.722 --> 02:03:13.545]  These people know who runs the world, and so they have no qualms at all saying, you're absolutely right, we just can't say it.
[02:03:14.265 --> 02:03:15.105]  We're good to go.
[02:03:28.951 --> 02:03:29.972]  We're good to go.
[02:03:54.776 --> 02:04:01.065]  Final question in the one minute we have Daniel Esselin, danielesselin.com and obviously I want to get you back for the film and the book.
[02:04:01.065 --> 02:04:04.410]  Are there any breaks inside the elite families themselves?
[02:04:04.410 --> 02:04:09.157]  Are any of them not liking what their families are doing?
[02:04:10.919 --> 02:04:18.883]  I think so, because you know, you're talking about a close-knit circle of the elite themselves, and you have the others who come and join these meetings, but they're not as important.
[02:04:18.883 --> 02:04:26.747]  It's for these others who come and join on regular, not so regular basis, that you're seeing a lot of discontent by the elite themselves.
[02:04:26.747 --> 02:04:32.410]  It's a small nucleus, and they're united, they understand their goals, and it's like a close-knit family.
[02:04:32.410 --> 02:04:35.412]  They have a common enemy, that's us, and they're working at getting started.
[02:04:36.007 --> 02:04:37.008]  We are their enemy.
[02:04:37.008 --> 02:04:37.428]  Wow.
[02:04:37.428 --> 02:04:38.348]  Powerful interview.
[02:04:38.348 --> 02:04:39.609]  There's the name of the interview right there.
[02:04:39.609 --> 02:04:42.330]  We posted on the web after it's live today.
[02:04:42.330 --> 02:04:43.811]  Just aired.
[02:04:43.811 --> 02:04:45.672]  The Bilderberg's enemy.
[02:04:45.672 --> 02:04:46.932]  The Bilderberg has an enemy.
[02:04:46.932 --> 02:04:47.893]  It's us.
[02:04:47.893 --> 02:04:48.913]  Or Bilderberg.
[02:04:48.913 --> 02:04:50.054]  I gotta think about that.
[02:04:50.054 --> 02:04:52.635]  Daniel Esselstyn, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:52.635 --> 02:04:53.496]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:04:53.496 --> 02:04:54.376]  To you.
[02:04:54.376 --> 02:04:56.617]  Alright, we'll be right back with a big news blitz.
[02:04:56.617 --> 02:04:59.879]  Then we've got a World War II veteran, a hero, having his house taken.
[02:05:01.254 --> 02:05:07.919]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:07.919 --> 02:05:13.063]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.063 --> 02:05:21.790]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:25.853]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:25.853 --> 02:05:27.814]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.114 --> 02:05:34.856]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:05:34.856 --> 02:05:38.698]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:05:38.698 --> 02:05:39.938]  Others don't.
[02:05:39.938 --> 02:05:42.079]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.079 --> 02:05:43.860]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:46.741]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:08:22.566 --> 02:08:29.094]  Okay, coming up at the bottom of the hour, Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers is going to be joining us.
[02:08:29.094 --> 02:08:32.137]  This article is up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:08:32.137 --> 02:08:37.744]  World War II war hero has land and home stolen.
[02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:41.431]  And they are coming to take us home.
[02:08:41.431 --> 02:08:43.571]  They've already announced it's theirs.
[02:08:43.571 --> 02:08:48.293]  And, again, it wasn't the mortgage from the info I have from Stuart Rhodes.
[02:08:48.293 --> 02:08:50.774]  It is that he's bankrupt, so now they're going to take his house.
[02:08:50.774 --> 02:08:53.755]  Don't they have homesteads where this guy's based?
[02:08:53.755 --> 02:08:55.035]  We're trying to get him on as well.
[02:08:55.035 --> 02:08:59.357]  His hearing's not good, and he's on his way to the VA right now.
[02:08:59.357 --> 02:09:05.459]  But I've just seen how these banks and people prey on old people, and it makes me really, really, really angry.
[02:09:05.459 --> 02:09:08.140]  You know, we bail them out with tens of trillions of dollars, and then
[02:09:09.608 --> 02:09:10.528]  For creditors.
[02:09:10.528 --> 02:09:15.030]  He's saying for medical bills and credit card bills, they're taking his house.
[02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:20.411]  So it looks like it's the trustee of the bankruptcy.
[02:09:20.411 --> 02:09:24.693]  That's who he needs to have a talking to about this stuff.
[02:09:24.693 --> 02:09:27.374]  Just amazing to see this kind of stuff happening.
[02:09:27.374 --> 02:09:30.395]  Don't forget, I talked about this in the first hour.
[02:09:30.395 --> 02:09:33.436]  I'm launching a nationwide contest.
[02:09:33.436 --> 02:09:37.377]  Before I get into the news, I want to talk about this briefly again.
[02:09:38.723 --> 02:09:44.327]  To expose the fact that the presidency is becoming a dictatorship.
[02:09:44.327 --> 02:09:47.289]  And the president right now is Obama.
[02:09:47.289 --> 02:09:53.233]  And we did another one of these operations three years ago and media all over the U.S.
[02:09:53.233 --> 02:09:58.677]  implied it was illegal to criticize the president.
[02:09:58.677 --> 02:10:03.641]  And we have clips of those newscasts actually in a video posted there titled, Stop Dictator Obama.
[02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:06.481]  Now there's $15,000 in prizes.
[02:10:06.481 --> 02:10:11.925]  By the way, I will announce the $10,000 winners, $5,000 apiece, next Thursday.
[02:10:11.925 --> 02:10:14.987]  We're going to start today posting the finalists.
[02:10:14.987 --> 02:10:15.968]  We've got it down to about...
[02:10:18.012 --> 02:10:19.213]  Down to about a hundred.
[02:10:19.213 --> 02:10:23.956]  I mean, I'm going to have to stay up here late tonight because there's so many good people.
[02:10:23.956 --> 02:10:26.698]  Over 600 entries for the Reporter Contest.
[02:10:26.698 --> 02:10:29.240]  And I've had to not do the TV show this week because of this.
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:30.921]  I'm not complaining.
[02:10:30.921 --> 02:10:31.942]  It's my fault.
[02:10:31.942 --> 02:10:34.083]  I bite off more than I can chew routinely.
[02:10:34.083 --> 02:10:40.187]  You know, I start a fight with somebody I can't whoop, as they say.
[02:10:40.187 --> 02:10:41.808]  Because, wow, look at that sign.
[02:10:41.808 --> 02:10:42.869]  Infowars.com.
[02:10:42.869 --> 02:10:43.650]  Dictatorscum.
[02:10:43.650 --> 02:10:44.850]  Resign.
[02:10:44.850 --> 02:10:45.571]  Who came up with that?
[02:10:48.675 --> 02:10:49.936]  Oh, Marcos did that.
[02:10:49.936 --> 02:10:52.138]  Wow.
[02:10:52.138 --> 02:10:53.259]  Wow, well let's put that up.
[02:10:53.259 --> 02:10:54.359]  That's a great graphic.
[02:10:54.359 --> 02:10:57.162]  Yeah, you can use our graphics and hang them or make your own.
[02:10:57.162 --> 02:10:58.062]  Doesn't matter.
[02:10:58.062 --> 02:11:02.426]  It's whoever hangs up the most in the most dramatic, legal and lawful way.
[02:11:02.426 --> 02:11:08.931]  That means if you can get on the stage legally and lawfully of a national TV show and go, look at my flyer, you'd probably win.
[02:11:08.931 --> 02:11:12.193]  Whoever has the biggest effect.
[02:11:12.193 --> 02:11:13.494]  Friday at midnight.
[02:11:13.494 --> 02:11:14.095]  Do it.
[02:11:14.095 --> 02:11:15.416]  Upload the video to YouTube.
[02:11:16.690 --> 02:11:19.432]  Download our flyers or make your own.
[02:11:19.432 --> 02:11:23.295]  That's phase one, $5,000 to get the media to cover it.
[02:11:23.295 --> 02:11:26.497]  And undoubtedly, they're going to end up attacking the First Amendment.
[02:11:26.497 --> 02:11:29.639]  That's how we defend it, showing these tyrants are coming after it.
[02:11:29.639 --> 02:11:31.381]  Then, over the next two weeks, $10,000.
[02:11:31.381 --> 02:11:35.424]  It's two winners.
[02:11:35.424 --> 02:11:36.644]  One will be $5,000, one will be $10,000.
[02:11:36.644 --> 02:11:38.366]  It's not a first and second place.
[02:11:38.366 --> 02:11:39.727]  It's two different contests.
[02:11:40.609 --> 02:11:42.250]  Same operation.
[02:11:42.250 --> 02:11:46.172]  And if you're the best and win round one, you can win round two, too.
[02:11:46.172 --> 02:11:50.735]  This is not some communist system where, oh, well, you've already won.
[02:11:50.735 --> 02:12:02.742]  Now I'm reading about swim teams, even big swim teams, where if somebody keeps winning all the blue ribbons and all the best at the meet in their age group that they're now not going to let you have,
[02:12:03.542 --> 02:12:05.423]  Have it the second time?
[02:12:05.423 --> 02:12:12.225]  And I'm hearing about people that win spelling bees at schools now aren't allowed to win the next time or disqualified.
[02:12:12.225 --> 02:12:15.526]  This is actually in the news.
[02:12:15.526 --> 02:12:20.668]  So I guess on swim team, my son and my daughter both win the blue ribbons almost every time.
[02:12:22.338 --> 02:12:24.499]  I was a good swimmer as well.
[02:12:24.499 --> 02:12:25.340]  Man, I'm out of state in it.
[02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:29.402]  I swam like three seasons and was winning almost every time.
[02:12:29.402 --> 02:12:32.544]  And I was like 12 and looked at my parents and said, I don't want to do this anymore.
[02:12:32.544 --> 02:12:36.887]  And they said, okay.
[02:12:36.887 --> 02:12:41.610]  Okay, you don't have to do this anymore.
[02:12:41.610 --> 02:12:44.212]  I wish that I would have been made to continue to do it.
[02:12:44.212 --> 02:12:46.053]  But that's another side issue.
[02:12:46.053 --> 02:12:47.254]  I am getting bleed over.
[02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:56.292]  And I don't know if I'm getting it from Genesis up in Minnesota, or I don't know if I'm getting it in here.
[02:12:56.292 --> 02:13:01.653]  But it is driving me absolutely crazy.
[02:13:01.653 --> 02:13:08.295]  It's probably from Genesis, because it's another show.
[02:13:08.295 --> 02:13:10.716]  But it is extremely irritating.
[02:13:10.716 --> 02:13:12.736]  Very irritating.
[02:13:12.736 --> 02:13:16.237]  Okay, I mean, I don't know how you're supposed to do a radio show with somebody spitting in your ear.
[02:13:16.237 --> 02:13:18.218]  And if you guys can't hear it, I can hear it.
[02:13:18.218 --> 02:13:19.138]  I can... I can...
[02:13:20.165 --> 02:13:29.228]  Yeah, no, I'm just letting everybody know, because we always go through that process of, you know... Just went away.
[02:13:29.228 --> 02:13:30.948]  Must have been on Genesis 10.
[02:13:30.948 --> 02:13:34.729]  Thank you, John.
[02:13:34.729 --> 02:13:36.690]  Wait a minute.
[02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:37.990]  It's me.
[02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:39.270]  It's a second delay.
[02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:41.811]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:13:41.811 --> 02:13:44.352]  Echo!
[02:13:44.352 --> 02:13:44.632]  Echo!
[02:13:48.089 --> 02:13:49.530]  Boy, nobody's more annoying than me.
[02:13:49.530 --> 02:13:50.851]  I have to hear myself.
[02:13:50.851 --> 02:13:53.393]  People have my show on even at night up here listening to it.
[02:13:53.393 --> 02:13:55.214]  I walk around the office going, turn it off!
[02:13:55.214 --> 02:13:56.335]  Turn it off!
[02:13:56.335 --> 02:13:58.176]  Don't make me listen to that guy anymore.
[02:13:58.176 --> 02:14:03.359]  Once is enough!
[02:14:03.359 --> 02:14:04.800]  I said I'd cover news, didn't I?
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:06.121]  Well, I've already read all this news.
[02:14:06.121 --> 02:14:08.303]  I covered a bunch of them when I first got on air, but...
[02:14:09.795 --> 02:14:12.037]  It is all so crazy.
[02:14:12.037 --> 02:14:13.898]  Okay, let me just go over this report.
[02:14:13.898 --> 02:14:15.379]  Let's just start somewhere.
[02:14:15.379 --> 02:14:18.461]  Woman arrested for groping TSA supervisor.
[02:14:18.461 --> 02:14:25.206]  Federal agency characterizes incident as act of violence.
[02:14:25.206 --> 02:14:30.890]  And it goes on here that the woman was a former TSA person but quit doing it.
[02:14:30.890 --> 02:14:32.372]  And then she was flying out.
[02:14:33.804 --> 02:14:34.345]  I don't know.
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:15:01.045]  So again, they're going to sexually assault you, and if a cop did this, without it being an emergency situation, they'd get charged, but these people can do it because the federal government says so.
[02:15:01.045 --> 02:15:09.108]  Carol Price, herself a former TSA screener, was traveling to her brother's funeral in Cleveland, Ohio by way of Southwest Florida International Airport.
[02:15:09.108 --> 02:15:12.129]  After Price became infuriated,
[02:15:14.508 --> 02:15:22.517]  ...at receiving a pat-down which included touching her breast and genitals, a violation of the protocols she herself had been trained to carry out.
[02:15:22.517 --> 02:15:24.560]  Well, you were there in the old days, lady.
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:26.382]  They take babies' diapers off now.
[02:15:26.382 --> 02:15:31.568]  The Lee County woman voiced her complaint to a TSA supervisor by physically demonstrating how she was groped.
[02:15:32.358 --> 02:15:39.560]  The video shows Price briefly running her hands up and down and inside the thigh and crotch of the TSA supervisor.
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:46.041]  Well, if they didn't resist, that's how TSA gets away with this, by the way, then you could say it was consensual.
[02:15:46.041 --> 02:15:49.202]  That's what she needs to have her lawyers say that, oh, she said I could show her how it's done.
[02:15:49.202 --> 02:15:50.562]  Oh, but then it's assault.
[02:15:50.562 --> 02:15:51.382]  You don't do that to me.
[02:15:51.382 --> 02:15:53.883]  I do that to little, little, little old ladies all day.
[02:15:55.936 --> 02:15:57.257]  It continues here.
[02:15:57.257 --> 02:16:04.140]  Price believed she was being targeted for harsh treatment by her former co-worker for personal reasons.
[02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:10.002]  She was removed from her flight, missed her brother's funeral, handcuffed, and taken to jail.
[02:16:10.002 --> 02:16:12.664]  Okay, continuing, moving right along here.
[02:16:12.664 --> 02:16:16.385]  I mentioned this earlier, but I want to get into it a little bit now.
[02:16:16.385 --> 02:16:22.008]  Woman sues city of Tulsa for cutting down her edible garden.
[02:16:22.008 --> 02:16:24.789]  And later, if we have time, we'll play a short clip of that.
[02:16:32.658 --> 02:16:42.641]  Continuing here, a Tulsa woman is suing the city's code enforcement officers after she said they cut down her garden with no cause.
[02:16:42.641 --> 02:16:47.703]  Denise Morrison said she had more than 100 plant varieties in her front and backyard.
[02:16:47.703 --> 02:16:48.843]  You don't do that, prisoner!
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:51.602]  This is a super max.
[02:16:51.602 --> 02:16:54.024]  Only medium and low max have gardens.
[02:16:54.024 --> 02:16:55.706]  You're in a super max.
[02:16:55.706 --> 02:16:56.927]  You scum American.
[02:16:56.927 --> 02:17:05.034]  Denise Morrison said she has more than 100 plant varieties in her front and backyard and all of them are edible or have a purpose.
[02:17:06.397 --> 02:17:08.819]  And it goes on.
[02:17:08.819 --> 02:17:10.320]  There's not even a rule in Tulsa.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:11.441]  They tried a few years ago.
[02:17:11.441 --> 02:17:12.441]  We covered it.
[02:17:12.441 --> 02:17:19.106]  I mean, there was the mayor and city council people in the news saying, you might grow marijuana, so you've got to have an inspection.
[02:17:19.106 --> 02:17:20.306]  They tried to get a law passed.
[02:17:20.306 --> 02:17:22.708]  You've got to have a government inspection.
[02:17:22.708 --> 02:17:26.471]  Well, they couldn't get that passed, so now they just come out, cut it down, saying it's a nuisance.
[02:17:27.771 --> 02:17:29.532]  I saw the newscast.
[02:17:29.532 --> 02:17:30.432]  Just amazing.
[02:17:30.432 --> 02:17:33.534]  And it's a nice little garden she's got.
[02:17:33.534 --> 02:17:34.074]  Very pretty.
[02:17:34.074 --> 02:17:35.755]  I wish I had one that nice.
[02:17:35.755 --> 02:17:37.435]  And it's all gone!
[02:17:37.435 --> 02:17:40.237]  You're not going to grow lemons in your front yard, slave.
[02:17:40.237 --> 02:17:40.697]  Okay?
[02:17:40.697 --> 02:17:43.598]  What do you think this is, America?
[02:17:43.598 --> 02:17:46.159]  You're in North Korea, honey!
[02:17:46.159 --> 02:17:47.500]  Continuing here with the news.
[02:17:48.519 --> 02:17:52.623]  Big article from the American Dream blog up at Infowars.com.
[02:17:52.623 --> 02:18:01.032]  All over America, government control freaks are forcing preppers back onto the grid.
[02:18:01.032 --> 02:18:05.116]  And there's article after article in this long story of them.
[02:18:06.158 --> 02:18:09.319]  People who hook up their own solar.
[02:18:09.319 --> 02:18:14.060]  In California they're coming out and saying you're not allowed to have your own solar, you gotta be hooked into the grid if you have solar.
[02:18:14.060 --> 02:18:16.280]  People out in the country are being harassed.
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:20.641]  People that have had outhouses for 50 years are being told they can't have them.
[02:18:20.641 --> 02:18:23.882]  Nuisance abatement teams are going into the countryside everywhere.
[02:18:23.882 --> 02:18:27.183]  I mean, just article after article after article.
[02:18:31.671 --> 02:18:34.913]  And it's just incredible to see.
[02:18:34.913 --> 02:18:36.394]  This is how they're bringing in the tyranny.
[02:18:36.394 --> 02:18:44.258]  This is part of Agenda 21, is this system of using zoning, unified global zoning, to harass the daylights out of you.
[02:18:44.258 --> 02:18:47.600]  Oh, $2,000 a day fines for hay dust in a barn.
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:49.741]  Hay dust is bad, is a pollutant.
[02:18:49.741 --> 02:18:54.303]  Oh, when there's a rain, if any mud runs off in the creek because you have cows, huge fines.
[02:18:54.303 --> 02:18:58.726]  Oh, oh, you're, I mean, meanwhile, Big Agra is totally left alone to do whatever they want.
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:01.582]  GMOs left alone, all of it.
[02:19:01.582 --> 02:19:06.806]  They're trying to ban chickens in small towns everywhere, even killing people that have them.
[02:19:06.806 --> 02:19:10.289]  Remember the chicken man up in Georgia there in Roswell, Georgia?
[02:19:11.229 --> 02:19:22.015]  Holder, oh by the way, just because our guys went up there and tried to talk to them, they put a million dollar security fence and barricades in because they're so scared that media came and talked to them in Georgia.
[02:19:22.015 --> 02:19:25.257]  I mean, that's how flipped out and crazy government's gotten.
[02:19:25.257 --> 02:19:27.058]  Holder agrees to meet with us.
[02:19:27.058 --> 02:19:28.459]  He's been in contempt.
[02:19:28.459 --> 02:19:32.281]  So now I guess he says, okay, I agree to meet, but he hasn't given them the documents.
[02:19:32.281 --> 02:19:33.782]  So we'll see what's going to happen with that.
[02:19:33.782 --> 02:19:35.363]  That's out of the Hill newspaper.
[02:19:35.363 --> 02:19:36.103]  Baseballs.
[02:19:37.344 --> 02:19:40.065]  Roger Clemens, acquitted of all charges.
[02:19:40.065 --> 02:19:43.886]  He lied to Congress, they claim, and they wanted to spend $3 million going after him.
[02:19:43.886 --> 02:19:45.386]  What about Eric Holder?
[02:19:45.386 --> 02:19:47.487]  They always want to go after some petty sportsperson.
[02:19:47.487 --> 02:19:55.629]  In fact, I'm going to cover that when we come back, and then we'll see if we can play a clip off that local news where you're not allowed to have a garden in Tulsa because you're a president.
[02:19:55.629 --> 02:19:56.149]  Stay with us.
[02:19:56.149 --> 02:19:57.049]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:03.706 --> 02:20:08.172]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:20:08.172 --> 02:20:11.516]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:20:11.516 --> 02:20:15.921]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:20:15.921 --> 02:20:16.923]  Here's why.
[02:20:16.923 --> 02:20:22.710]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:27.894]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:20:27.894 --> 02:20:34.280]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:38.124]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:20:38.124 --> 02:20:44.069]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:20:44.069 --> 02:20:49.414]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:20:49.674 --> 02:20:52.678]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[02:20:52.678 --> 02:21:00.907]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.

[02:21:37.068 --> 02:21:41.069]  Go to StunGunMics.com, spelled just like it sounds.
[02:21:41.069 --> 02:21:44.070]  StunGunMics.com.

[02:22:00.652 --> 02:22:03.635]  GCN listeners are wise when it comes to preparation.
[02:22:03.635 --> 02:22:10.082]  They know the realities of unemployment, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, nuclear meltdowns, and the debt crisis.
[02:22:10.082 --> 02:22:15.428]  The very real threat of food price inflation and food shortages loom on the near horizon.
[02:22:15.428 --> 02:22:21.314]  If you want great value for your hard-earned storable food dollar, you want Legacy Premium from PrepareWise.com.
[02:22:21.374 --> 02:22:21.754]  I think so.
[02:22:41.625 --> 02:22:46.887]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:22:46.887 --> 02:22:48.788]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:08.849 --> 02:23:17.992]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:17.992 --> 02:23:22.894]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:23:23.530 --> 02:23:34.903]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:23:34.903 --> 02:23:41.912]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:23:42.592 --> 02:23:46.897]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:23:46.897 --> 02:23:50.502]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:23:50.502 --> 02:23:57.770]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:23:57.770 --> 02:23:59.031]  Protect your immune system.
[02:23:59.031 --> 02:24:00.073]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:11.123 --> 02:24:17.307]  We ain't nothing if we can't have little gardens in the front of our yards, in the back of our yards.
[02:24:17.307 --> 02:24:18.847]  The government doesn't like it.
[02:24:18.847 --> 02:24:22.429]  Tulsa says they don't like people growing gardens.
[02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:23.970]  And I've seen it in other areas.
[02:24:23.970 --> 02:24:27.012]  People have been arrested before for gardens.
[02:24:27.012 --> 02:24:29.293]  And then the code inspector shows up and people show them.
[02:24:29.293 --> 02:24:31.815]  They go, well it says I can have a garden, city ordinance.
[02:24:32.679 --> 02:24:37.842]  Well, I say it's objectionable, and you notice it says anything that we find objectionable.
[02:24:37.842 --> 02:24:40.664]  Well, I guess you're God then, Code Inspector.
[02:24:40.664 --> 02:24:44.507]  I've run into some code inspectors that are the scum of the earth.
[02:24:44.507 --> 02:24:47.569]  I've run into some others that are real nice people.
[02:24:47.569 --> 02:24:52.732]  But more and more they want to hire people that hate private property and hate people's freedom.
[02:24:54.552 --> 02:24:55.674]  But maybe I'm an extremist.
[02:24:55.674 --> 02:25:01.119]  I mean, maybe the right for the Amish to have milk, maybe the right to have your own privacy in your home is wrong.
[02:25:01.119 --> 02:25:02.180]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:02.801]  Look at this.
[02:25:02.801 --> 02:25:04.963]  NYPD stop and frisk.
[02:25:04.963 --> 02:25:08.027]  They had 200 plus thousand in the first three months of this year.
[02:25:08.027 --> 02:25:09.488]  We haven't gotten new numbers.
[02:25:09.488 --> 02:25:14.353]  This has happened to yours truly in England and in London, England and in New York.
[02:25:15.054 --> 02:25:20.699]  Where the police search your car, search your person, and if you say, well, what about the Fourth Amendment?
[02:25:20.699 --> 02:25:24.422]  They scream at you and threaten to taser you and take you to jail.
[02:25:24.422 --> 02:25:27.064]  I have some of this on video in martial law.
[02:25:27.064 --> 02:25:30.827]  I'm walking down the street and a cop comes over and says, what are you doing with a video camera?
[02:25:30.827 --> 02:25:31.628]  And I said, well, I'm media.
[02:25:32.608 --> 02:25:38.914]  Because about 400 yards away was the big facility where they were holding the protesters out there on Pier 57.
[02:25:38.914 --> 02:25:44.679]  And he started screaming at me saying, you shut up, you know, you filth and all this stuff.
[02:25:44.679 --> 02:25:48.303]  And it's just like, wow, you really are a gang member with a badge and gun.
[02:25:48.303 --> 02:25:51.226]  You are like a North Korean police officer.
[02:25:51.226 --> 02:25:53.528]  You're everything wrong with this country.
[02:25:54.833 --> 02:25:56.676]  And imagine living in New York.
[02:25:56.676 --> 02:25:59.440]  None of it has anything to do with the staged events of 9-11.
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:02.564]  The cops that breathe the deadly dust are treated like garbage.
[02:26:02.564 --> 02:26:03.625]  They don't care.
[02:26:03.625 --> 02:26:05.448]  As long as they can bully some people.
[02:26:05.448 --> 02:26:08.873]  And again, we don't want police to become like this everywhere.
[02:26:08.873 --> 02:26:10.054]  That's why we're criticizing it.
[02:26:10.675 --> 02:26:13.938]  Bloomberg remains firm on stop-and-frisk policy.
[02:26:13.938 --> 02:26:15.799]  It's not a law.
[02:26:15.799 --> 02:26:16.940]  It's a policy.
[02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:21.063]  It's a policy for the TSA to grope your daughter, your wife, your son.
[02:26:21.063 --> 02:26:23.765]  It's a policy to put you in a microwave system.
[02:26:23.765 --> 02:26:25.847]  It's a policy.
[02:26:25.847 --> 02:26:29.890]  A policy.
[02:26:29.890 --> 02:26:30.291]  Look at this.
[02:26:31.326 --> 02:26:35.489]  Curt Nemo article, Infowars.com, linked to Declan McCullough of CNET News.
[02:26:35.489 --> 02:26:36.810]  This is not a joke.
[02:26:36.810 --> 02:26:39.912]  FBI wants to outlaw new internet technology.
[02:26:39.912 --> 02:26:47.617]  They say that they don't want to force companies to give them back doors to everything, just outlaw new forms of internet communications.
[02:26:47.617 --> 02:26:49.078]  I'm not joking.
[02:26:49.078 --> 02:26:55.382]  The FBI wants Congress to pass a law that would prevent the implementation, talk about a Luddite, of new
[02:26:56.730 --> 02:27:05.997]  And more effective internet communications protocol, it proposes IPv6 because it is more difficult to trace users.
[02:27:05.997 --> 02:27:08.559]  IPv5 makes surveillance easier.
[02:27:08.559 --> 02:27:11.722]  So they want IPv6 banned.
[02:27:11.722 --> 02:27:15.845]  The FBI Drug Enforcement Administration, because somebody might commit a crime on the internet.
[02:27:15.845 --> 02:27:20.208]  Somebody might grow pot in their garden so you can't have one in Tulsa.
[02:27:20.208 --> 02:27:22.210]  There's no law, but we have guns!
[02:27:23.396 --> 02:27:26.398]  Now there it is on screen if you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:26.398 --> 02:27:37.404]  FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Royal Canadian Mounted Police Officers have told industry representatives that IPV6 traceability is necessary to identify people suspicious of crimes.
[02:27:37.404 --> 02:27:42.407]  The FBI has even suggested that the new law may be necessary if the private sector doesn't do enough voluntarily.
[02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:45.169]  The FBI is upset about going dark problem.
[02:27:45.169 --> 02:27:49.071]  In other words, it's having difficulty keeping up with changes in technology.
[02:27:49.071 --> 02:27:52.794]  It's formed the Domestic Communications Assistance Center to keep up with the speed.
[02:27:52.794 --> 02:28:03.542]  Instead of figuring out how to trace the new protocol, the FBI wants the federal government to come up with law that prevents ISPs, the agency describes as lazy, from using more efficient technology.
[02:28:05.049 --> 02:28:09.472]  So they want to ban people using one type because they say it's not as easy for them.
[02:28:09.472 --> 02:28:18.078]  The IP also wants to force ISPs, Internet Service Providers, to spend their own money and time keeping records of what IP addresses their customers are assigned.
[02:28:18.078 --> 02:28:21.601]  Congress approves this burdensome requirement last year.
[02:28:21.601 --> 02:28:26.644]  Well, I mean, IP addresses are public dodos!
[02:28:26.644 --> 02:28:29.586]  So, for websites and things, why don't you just do it?
[02:28:29.586 --> 02:28:32.588]  Again, under the entire... I just called them a bad name.
[02:28:32.588 --> 02:28:34.170]  I called the FBI dodos.
[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:37.461]  I sound like my grandmother's grandmother now.
[02:28:37.461 --> 02:28:41.102]  You nasty little dodo!
[02:28:41.102 --> 02:28:44.543]  My grandmother's mother wouldn't even say the word spit.
[02:28:44.543 --> 02:28:48.164]  Look how far we've slumped towards Gomorrah here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:48.164 --> 02:28:50.684]  Spit, spit, spittle, spat!
[02:28:50.684 --> 02:28:52.345]  Ah-ha!
[02:28:52.345 --> 02:28:54.165]  Ah-ha!
[02:28:54.165 --> 02:28:54.905]  Ah-ha!
[02:28:54.905 --> 02:28:56.146]  Anyways, continuing here.
[02:28:56.146 --> 02:28:59.447]  I'm going crazy reading all this news.
[02:28:59.447 --> 02:29:02.528]  Big article with big mainline studies.
[02:29:02.528 --> 02:29:03.528]  You gotta read this.
[02:29:04.662 --> 02:29:06.503]  I meant to spend like an hour on this today.
[02:29:06.503 --> 02:29:14.909]  Vaccinated children have up to 500 more diseases, excuse me, 500% more diseases than unvaccinated children.
[02:29:14.909 --> 02:29:16.590]  Yeah, look at all the Canadian studies.
[02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:21.514]  Doubles your chances of getting the flu the next year if you take the flu shot.
[02:29:21.514 --> 02:29:22.615]  Just look that up.
[02:29:22.615 --> 02:29:23.976]  I mean it fries people.
[02:29:24.884 --> 02:29:26.124]  This came out earlier this year.
[02:29:26.124 --> 02:29:37.147]  Most of the new, it was something like 65%, I forget the exact number, it was over 60% of the whooping cough cases in California that they're using as an excuse, the increase, to try to push vaccination.
[02:29:37.147 --> 02:29:40.588]  The increase was caused by vaccinated children getting it.
[02:29:40.588 --> 02:29:50.270]  Just like 46,000 plus cases of polio that killed over 10,000 from the UN's polio program last year in India alone.
[02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:51.670]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:53.171]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.196 --> 02:30:00.861]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.861 --> 02:30:05.424]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.424 --> 02:30:09.767]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.767 --> 02:30:15.511]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.511 --> 02:30:20.815]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.115 --> 02:30:21.936]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.936 --> 02:30:25.519]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.519 --> 02:30:29.443]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.443 --> 02:30:30.243]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.243 --> 02:30:33.006]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.006 --> 02:30:36.689]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.689 --> 02:30:37.470]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.470 --> 02:30:41.614]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.614 --> 02:30:45.297]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.
[02:30:45.297 --> 02:30:46.378]  One of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:08.292 --> 02:32:17.399]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:17.399 --> 02:32:20.842]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:32:20.842 --> 02:32:22.543]  There's no priming required.
[02:32:22.543 --> 02:32:24.805]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:32:24.805 --> 02:32:27.307]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:32:28.368 --> 02:32:29.889]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:32:29.889 --> 02:32:31.309]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:32:31.309 --> 02:32:34.471]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:32:34.471 --> 02:32:37.853]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:32:37.853 --> 02:32:41.995]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:32:41.995 --> 02:32:44.736]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:32:44.736 --> 02:32:46.317]  It's what my family uses.

[02:32:56.863 --> 02:32:58.246]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:28.436 --> 02:33:35.581]  Okay ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here and this is an amazing report we're about to break down here.
[02:33:35.581 --> 02:33:49.730]  I would like to get our guest on sometime, just because there are so few World War II vets left out there, especially those that have seen the type of things that he's seen.
[02:33:51.028 --> 02:34:11.216]  The gentleman that is having his home and his land taken and they want him to exhume his wife is Warren C. Bodeker, 89-year-old World War II Army airborne combat veteran and war hero living in Montana who's being thrown off his own land and thrown out of his own house by Montana federal bankruptcy trustee.
[02:34:12.642 --> 02:34:15.065]  And again, a house and land for what I know are paid for.
[02:34:15.065 --> 02:34:23.495]  Correct me if I'm wrong, we're going to Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, himself a paratrooper of a later era, and he's also a constitutional lawyer.
[02:34:23.495 --> 02:34:29.001]  He's also representing Rob Dewey in his suit against the G20 for our reporter getting arrested a few years ago.
[02:34:29.001 --> 02:34:29.722]  That's another issue.
[02:34:31.784 --> 02:34:38.948]  Warren C. Boedeker was one of the people involved in the Los Banos raid.
[02:34:38.948 --> 02:34:44.712]  It's one of the most celebrated textbook examples of a perfect rescue operation in military history.
[02:34:44.712 --> 02:34:48.214]  And you can read about it there in the link that's at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:48.214 --> 02:34:52.696]  World War II war hero is having his land and home stolen over at Oath Keepers.
[02:34:52.696 --> 02:34:54.277]  They also have the article.
[02:34:54.277 --> 02:34:57.559]  That's where it originates from.
[02:34:57.559 --> 02:35:00.441]  And it just goes over all the
[02:35:01.101 --> 02:35:01.601]  Different things.
[02:35:01.601 --> 02:35:11.747]  I mean, a real live war hero was part of one of the most famous rescue operations ever, parachuting behind enemy lines to fight a larger force of Japanese who'd been killing U.S.
[02:35:11.747 --> 02:35:15.909]  and British troops as they left the POW camps that they had as they retreated.
[02:35:15.909 --> 02:35:20.071]  So they went in and shaved the people before they could kill any of them.
[02:35:20.071 --> 02:35:21.252]  And he had to go to the V.A.
[02:35:21.252 --> 02:35:21.512]  today.
[02:35:21.512 --> 02:35:22.552]  He's driving down the road.
[02:35:22.552 --> 02:35:23.853]  He's getting to a better sell spot.
[02:35:23.853 --> 02:35:25.074]  We're gonna call Warren here.
[02:35:25.914 --> 02:35:26.695]  Uh, in a few minutes.
[02:35:26.695 --> 02:35:34.820]  In fact, he's online with us now, but I wanted, I wanted to bring Stuart Rhodes up first, who's gone and shot a video interview that's posted at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:37.482]  We're going to play part of that coming up as well.
[02:35:37.482 --> 02:35:40.985]  But Stuart, because you're a lawyer, you've met with him, you know the case.
[02:35:40.985 --> 02:35:52.853]  Give us the specifics, because, you know, this is happening to veterans all over the country, and not just veterans, the citizens, and the big banks have been caught taking houses that are totally paid for, they don't even have deeds to.
[02:35:52.853 --> 02:35:54.875]  In this case, though, I didn't know
[02:35:55.655 --> 02:36:06.807]  That you could take people's houses if they were retired and they were homesteaded, their house, if it was their only residence, and if they were retired, at least in Texas and most other states.
[02:36:06.807 --> 02:36:11.592]  I know you're up in Montana as well, so you're the one breaking the story.
[02:36:11.592 --> 02:36:14.895]  Constitutional lawyer Stuart Rhodes, what do you make of this?
[02:36:14.895 --> 02:36:15.616]  What's happening?
[02:36:15.616 --> 02:36:18.039]  And tell us about Warren C. Boedeker.
[02:36:18.991 --> 02:36:21.172]  Well, what this really is, is elder abuse.
[02:36:21.172 --> 02:36:29.674]  What they did is, he didn't disclose some silver coins that he had, that him and his wife had been storing away since 1964.
[02:36:29.674 --> 02:36:37.756]  You know, they store food, they're LDS, they've stored food all their lives, and they also socked away some silver, and they never spent it.
[02:36:37.756 --> 02:36:39.637]  And in his mind, this was his retirement.
[02:36:40.197 --> 02:36:41.519]  And so he didn't disclose it.
[02:36:41.519 --> 02:36:48.767]  Because he didn't disclose that, and he had a relative of his, unfortunately, rat him out to the court, his stepson.
[02:36:48.767 --> 02:36:52.771]  And when they found that out, then they dropped a hammer on him and said, you didn't disclose this.
[02:36:52.771 --> 02:36:54.453]  And so we're going to take everything you own.
[02:36:54.453 --> 02:36:55.955]  We're going to do an adversarial proceeding.
[02:36:55.955 --> 02:36:56.736]  But that's ridiculous.
[02:36:56.736 --> 02:36:59.159]  If he had something back in the 60s, I mean, that's his.
[02:37:00.458 --> 02:37:03.079]  Well, you know, he should have disclosed it.
[02:37:03.079 --> 02:37:04.820]  Even if it's exempt, they're supposed to disclose it.
[02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:05.821]  This is the problem.
[02:37:05.821 --> 02:37:15.346]  Here's a man who doesn't understand complex legal issues, doesn't understand bankruptcy, and they get him in this position, and once they got something on him, they just went after him like a mad dog.
[02:37:15.846 --> 02:37:21.027]  And they just said, you know, if you fight us, we'll take everything you have and you'll wind up penniless.
[02:37:21.027 --> 02:37:22.368]  We'll attack your homestead.
[02:37:22.368 --> 02:37:23.728]  We'll void your homestead.
[02:37:23.728 --> 02:37:25.269]  We'll deny you the discharge.
[02:37:25.269 --> 02:37:35.291]  And so they pressured him into signing a stipulation that agreed to waive his homestead and give up his bankruptcy.
[02:37:35.291 --> 02:37:36.992]  And so he won it with nothing in the end.
[02:37:36.992 --> 02:37:38.092]  He didn't get anything out of it.
[02:37:38.092 --> 02:37:40.613]  They went ahead and denied him the bankruptcy.
[02:37:41.693 --> 02:37:44.664]  Well, over some coins, losing a house, land, everything.
[02:37:48.010 --> 02:37:54.796]  Right, and so they pressured him into signing this, and we're going to challenge this on his capacity to understand what he was signing.
[02:37:54.796 --> 02:37:57.999]  His lawyer at the time gave him, I think, horrendous advice.
[02:37:57.999 --> 02:38:00.981]  There's no way they're going to put an old man like this in prison.
[02:38:00.981 --> 02:38:07.147]  So it was an empty threat, but they pressured and threatened him with prison time, and they pressured him into signing away his right to his homestead.
[02:38:07.147 --> 02:38:11.250]  And as you said earlier, when you have a homestead like that, creditors can't get it.
[02:38:11.250 --> 02:38:15.314]  So he'd have been better off if he just unplugged his phone and threw all the bills in the trash
[02:38:15.714 --> 02:38:15.834]  That's
[02:38:31.448 --> 02:38:32.328]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:32.328 --> 02:38:33.369]  And this is the problem.
[02:38:52.463 --> 02:39:01.430]  From what I know of bankruptcy, and after calling, I'm not a bankruptcy lawyer, but I called several, and they said, well, the trustee gets a percentage of whatever she can bring into the estate.
[02:39:01.430 --> 02:39:09.697]  And so if she can attack, successfully attack, his homestead and bring the home into the estate for the creditors, then she gets a cut.
[02:39:09.697 --> 02:39:17.663]  And this is the other thing, is this trustee hired herself as the lawyer for the estate and as the lawyer for the trustee.
[02:39:17.663 --> 02:39:19.285]  So she's her own lawyer.
[02:39:19.285 --> 02:39:21.967]  And so she's charging legal fees to advise herself
[02:39:22.547 --> 02:39:23.928]  And to advise the estate.
[02:39:23.928 --> 02:39:28.450]  And then she's being paid a percentage, apparently, a percentage of the take for the whole thing.
[02:39:28.450 --> 02:39:33.593]  Oh, boy, I tell you, so this is a whole ball of worms here, Stewart, as a constitutional lawyer.
[02:39:33.593 --> 02:39:39.776]  I know, top of your class, but what was, I mean, this is a whole other legal hat to wear here, but I'm not a lawyer.
[02:39:39.776 --> 02:39:44.898]  But this looks like somebody's going to be in some big trouble, unless the local judge and everybody are in on it.
[02:39:44.898 --> 02:39:45.658]  Here's the problem.
[02:39:45.658 --> 02:39:47.999]  This guy is a famous war hero.
[02:39:47.999 --> 02:39:50.841]  Tell us about that, and then we're going to bring Warren C. Boedeker up.
[02:39:51.465 --> 02:39:55.169]  Well, as I said earlier, he's part of one of the most famous rescues.
[02:39:55.169 --> 02:40:07.081]  He, along with 121 other paratroopers, they parachuted in at 7 o'clock in the morning, first thing in the morning when they knew the Japanese guards would be out exercising, and they caught them with their pants down.
[02:40:07.081 --> 02:40:13.688]  They rescued over 2,000 civilians and also military, including men, women, and children.
[02:40:13.888 --> 02:40:16.789]  And they knew that the Japanese were going to slaughter them all.
[02:40:16.789 --> 02:40:17.450]  And they knew that.
[02:40:17.450 --> 02:40:18.410]  That's why they did this.
[02:40:18.410 --> 02:40:21.351]  They went in behind enemy lines, got them out.
[02:40:21.351 --> 02:40:33.997]  And when they came back and the Japanese retook the area, they took revenge on the local population and killed 1,500 Filipino men, women, and children villagers to get revenge on them for aiding the raid.
[02:40:33.997 --> 02:40:35.578]  And so this is a good example.
[02:40:35.578 --> 02:40:40.220]  I mean, if Warren hadn't done this, and him and his fellow paratroopers had not done this,
[02:40:40.820 --> 02:40:44.403]  All 2,200 of those prisoners would have been slaughtered.
[02:40:44.403 --> 02:40:46.824]  And then they would never have had children and grandchildren.
[02:40:46.824 --> 02:40:49.826]  You can probably figure about 50,000 people wouldn't exist on this planet.
[02:40:49.826 --> 02:40:52.268]  And by the way, I've never been in the military.
[02:40:52.268 --> 02:40:54.770]  I'm not even a history buff when it comes to the military.
[02:40:54.770 --> 02:41:00.694]  I knew about this raid because I remember over a decade ago seeing a show on it, I think it was History Channel, about this.
[02:41:00.694 --> 02:41:01.915]  This is a very famous...
[02:41:02.455 --> 02:41:02.895]  I can't believe it.
[02:41:34.597 --> 02:41:39.299]  I can't believe what they're doing.
[02:41:39.299 --> 02:41:43.181]  My wife and me built a home.
[02:41:43.181 --> 02:41:44.802]  Bought the property.
[02:41:44.802 --> 02:41:46.523]  Paid for it.
[02:41:46.523 --> 02:41:52.285]  We wanted this property to remain in the family.
[02:41:52.285 --> 02:41:53.126]  Never to be sold.
[02:41:53.126 --> 02:41:56.207]  For the rest of our lives.
[02:41:56.207 --> 02:41:59.549]  The rest of our prosperity.
[02:41:59.549 --> 02:42:03.811]  And we both agreed we both wanted to be buried on the property.
[02:42:05.012 --> 02:42:10.276]  She died July 3rd of last year with cancer and I buried her.
[02:42:10.276 --> 02:42:14.620]  Now they tell me I've got to dig her up and move her in 30 days time.
[02:42:14.620 --> 02:42:17.642]  That is cruel and very abusive.
[02:42:17.642 --> 02:42:19.403]  I mean, just to interrupt to ring Stewart Rhodes up.
[02:42:19.403 --> 02:42:22.666]  Stewart, I mean, isn't this a lawsuit waiting to happen?
[02:42:22.666 --> 02:42:24.928]  I mean, this type of cruel behavior towards somebody?
[02:42:25.618 --> 02:42:29.440]  Well, unfortunately, they've let the Nazis legalize everything they did.
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:31.561]  Apparently, this is now legal.
[02:42:31.561 --> 02:42:33.122]  They've made it legal.
[02:42:33.122 --> 02:42:38.085]  In fact, he was in the hospital last week being tested for prostate cancer.
[02:42:38.085 --> 02:42:39.726]  He's been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
[02:42:40.299 --> 02:42:43.703]  And they had a hearing on this, and he was not able to attend.
[02:42:43.703 --> 02:42:49.409]  He, from his hospital bed, he sent, he faxed in a motion to continue, and the judge denied it.
[02:42:49.409 --> 02:42:51.531]  So there's no excuse for him not being there.
[02:42:51.531 --> 02:42:52.452]  My God, who is okay?
[02:42:52.452 --> 02:42:53.433]  Well, I'm gonna go back to him.
[02:42:53.433 --> 02:42:56.055]  We obviously need to get on this judge with the public.
[02:42:56.055 --> 02:42:59.479]  And Montana, if you don't go stand up for this guy, you get what you deserve.
[02:42:59.479 --> 02:43:00.260]  The rest of America.
[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:03.181]  I'm sick of watching them pick on old people.
[02:43:03.181 --> 02:43:16.006]  This is how I got started on air 17 years ago as people remember those newscasts I did with them taking old people's land for three inch grass with the health department claiming that it was a zone violation.
[02:43:16.006 --> 02:43:21.448]  So I started going to city council people's houses and showing they had taller grass and demanding that they get in trouble.
[02:43:22.250 --> 02:43:23.351]  And they backed off.
[02:43:23.351 --> 02:43:26.912]  Where are people standing up for old folks?
[02:43:26.912 --> 02:43:33.315]  I'm gonna go back to Wren here in just a minute, but Stewart, tell us how you got in contact with him and then you can ask him the question since you know him.
[02:43:34.346 --> 02:43:41.370]  Well, I went down to a VFW hall to give an Oath Keeper presentation in Sanders County in Plains, where he lives.
[02:43:41.370 --> 02:43:44.392]  And the other veterans there told me about this.
[02:43:44.392 --> 02:43:47.134]  And then I got in contact direct with him.
[02:43:47.134 --> 02:43:49.475]  We're trying to find him a really good bankruptcy lawyer.
[02:43:49.475 --> 02:43:50.556]  I'm not a bankruptcy lawyer.
[02:43:50.556 --> 02:43:52.137]  I just don't know that system.
[02:43:52.137 --> 02:43:56.380]  And so we've got to find somebody who's an ace bankruptcy lawyer who will go in there and fight.
[02:43:56.380 --> 02:44:03.124]  My lawyer is Eric Tabb here in town, but he beats the city all the time and the feds, but I don't think he can practice in Montana.
[02:44:03.803 --> 02:44:08.866]  Well, if he's admitted to federal bankruptcy court, I believe he can be admitted pro hi-vice.
[02:44:08.866 --> 02:44:10.066]  So I think he could.
[02:44:10.066 --> 02:44:11.607]  So please put him in touch with me.
[02:44:11.607 --> 02:44:12.108]  All right, I will.
[02:44:12.108 --> 02:44:14.169]  I'll call my lawyer.
[02:44:14.169 --> 02:44:15.229]  Let's go back to Wren.
[02:44:15.229 --> 02:44:20.212]  I mean, why don't you ask him some of the questions here, Stuart, since you know him?
[02:44:20.212 --> 02:44:22.873]  Well, Wren, just give the people here a background.
[02:44:22.873 --> 02:44:26.856]  Like you said earlier, you planned on being buried there with your wife.
[02:44:26.856 --> 02:44:28.396]  You never intended to sell your property.
[02:44:28.396 --> 02:44:28.937]  Isn't that right?
[02:44:28.937 --> 02:44:31.298]  That's correct.
[02:44:31.298 --> 02:44:33.139]  And why'd you sign this stipulation?
[02:44:34.830 --> 02:44:40.775]  Did they threaten you with prison and with taking everything away from you and leaving you penniless?
[02:44:40.775 --> 02:44:51.623]  Yes, they said I could face federal prison under the Fraud Act and that I could end up in prison if I didn't make some changes.
[02:44:51.623 --> 02:45:02.652]  I don't remember exactly how they ordered it or anything else, but they had me sign a waiver on the bankruptcy that I went along with them not allowing my bankruptcy.
[02:45:03.988 --> 02:45:16.680]  And I don't remember the details exactly how it was they put it to me to release my homestead, which I ended up signing off on my homestead so that they could pay the creditors.
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:17.380]  Right.
[02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:18.581]  I do remember the details.
[02:45:18.581 --> 02:45:24.427]  The stipulation says that in exchange for them not doing it through an adversarial process,
[02:45:25.211 --> 02:45:25.912]  Thank you.
[02:45:36.565 --> 02:45:46.154]  And so, you really got nothing out of it, except they told you, well, if you don't do it this way, we'll eat up all of it with attorney's fees and costs, and in the end, you'll want a pennyless.
[02:45:46.154 --> 02:45:47.134]  Let me ask Wren this.
[02:45:47.134 --> 02:45:50.137]  Wren, are they preying on other elderly folks in your area?
[02:45:50.137 --> 02:45:57.424]  Because I've seen a pattern nationwide of shaking down and getting people to sign documents they don't understand.
[02:45:58.124 --> 02:46:06.226]  Uh, here in this, uh, this sickening country we live in where they, where they, you know, Time Magazine and Newsweek glorify euthanizing people like you.
[02:46:06.226 --> 02:46:10.087]  Uh, do you know other veterans or folks in your area being preyed on?
[02:46:10.087 --> 02:46:11.428]  No, I don't.
[02:46:11.428 --> 02:46:13.168]  Uh, not as such.
[02:46:13.168 --> 02:46:26.712]  I've heard, as I've watched the different things on the computer, I've read different things like in Florida and other places where they're doing not the exact same thing, but they are taking homes away from the veterans and putting them out on the street.
[02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:30.221]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:46:30.221 --> 02:46:31.161]  It's terrible.
[02:46:31.161 --> 02:46:34.423]  You know, all over the United States.
[02:46:34.423 --> 02:46:40.765]  How long do you have until they make you exhume your wife and move off your property?
[02:46:40.765 --> 02:46:50.189]  They have not sent me a notice in the mail, but at that hearing on the 12th that I couldn't be to, they said I had to move her off in 30 days time.
[02:46:50.189 --> 02:46:53.211]  So you're in the hospital and you sent that into the judge.
[02:46:53.211 --> 02:46:54.191]  Who is this judge?
[02:46:54.191 --> 02:46:56.472]  Do we know, Stuart, who this judge is?
[02:46:57.423 --> 02:46:59.025]  Yes, his last name is Kirshner.
[02:46:59.025 --> 02:47:03.631]  He's the federal judge for Montana for bankruptcy.
[02:47:03.631 --> 02:47:11.621]  The doctor sent in an affidavit to the judge that it was impossible for me to leave the hospital.
[02:47:11.621 --> 02:47:14.925]  And I believe, the way I heard it, the attorney for the veteran
[02:47:15.620 --> 02:47:20.403]  There in Fort Harrison also contacted the judge and told him I couldn't be there.
[02:47:20.403 --> 02:47:22.985]  The judge says it doesn't matter.
[02:47:22.985 --> 02:47:26.087]  It just went ahead with the trial without me there.
[02:47:26.087 --> 02:47:36.334]  I had this lady that's really been helping me, Roxanne Ryan, and I gave her power of attorney to act for me and they wouldn't pay any attention to what she said.
[02:47:36.334 --> 02:47:41.358]  And they ended up giving the property, selling the property that's worth between
[02:47:42.754 --> 02:47:48.298]  $350,000-$400,000 for $155,000 to this party.
[02:47:48.298 --> 02:47:53.422]  They gave us until last night, actually it was Sunday night, to be out of my home.
[02:47:53.422 --> 02:48:04.490]  With all my stuff at 3 o'clock yesterday, they were going to send the sheriff or a deputy and a locksmith to change the locks on my door so I could no longer get in.
[02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:06.611]  Yeah, I should have added how immediate this is.
[02:48:06.611 --> 02:48:11.613]  You're going to the VA right now, you've pulled over just to this interview for treatment for cancer.
[02:48:11.613 --> 02:48:15.856]  I mean, this is out, this is insane.
[02:48:15.856 --> 02:48:19.497]  Correct me if I'm wrong, Stuart, but you told me off-air, you told Dew off-air.
[02:48:19.497 --> 02:48:24.600]  Is it true the sheriff refused yesterday to go throw him out and told the feds they can just do it themselves?
[02:48:25.646 --> 02:48:45.014]  That's right, the Sheriff of Sanders County, Tom Rummel, I met him down at Sheriff Mack's Sheriff's Conference and he called the trustee yesterday and let her know that he believes that Wren, his due process rights were denied and he wasn't allowed to be at the hearing, he couldn't be at the hearing, he wasn't allowed to continue the hearing and they went without him.
[02:48:45.014 --> 02:48:45.954]  So he said, I'm not going to
[02:48:46.434 --> 02:48:48.276]  I'm not going to give you a deputy to do a standby.
[02:48:48.276 --> 02:48:51.678]  That's what they usually do, is they send a deputy along whenever they evict somebody.
[02:48:51.678 --> 02:48:52.899]  And he said, I'm not going to send a deputy.
[02:48:52.899 --> 02:48:54.661]  You'll have to do it on your own.
[02:48:54.661 --> 02:48:56.902]  Go find somebody else to be your muscle.
[02:48:56.902 --> 02:49:00.845]  So I think that's one silver lining in this horrible story.
[02:49:00.845 --> 02:49:02.046]  She did not show up.
[02:49:02.046 --> 02:49:05.149]  In fact, the locksmith did not show up.
[02:49:05.149 --> 02:49:06.009]  Neither did the buyer.
[02:49:06.009 --> 02:49:07.070]  No one showed up yesterday.
[02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:07.851]  They all stayed away.
[02:49:08.411 --> 02:49:10.993]  I think they're like cockroaches scurrying from the light.
[02:49:10.993 --> 02:49:13.916]  They don't want to confront us angry veterans.
[02:49:13.916 --> 02:49:15.317]  They don't want to confront the news media.
[02:49:15.317 --> 02:49:16.678]  We call the local media out there.
[02:49:16.678 --> 02:49:27.487]  Well, as you know, we sent reporters up to Georgia where that man who'd had chickens for decades in the edge of town, they were trying to take his house.
[02:49:27.487 --> 02:49:32.211]  And we found out the Sheriff's Department, the police, none of them were there.
[02:49:32.211 --> 02:49:35.954]  My intel is they had army from Brigade Homeland dressed up
[02:49:37.216 --> 02:49:39.959]  To carry out the eviction, and that's what happened.
[02:49:39.959 --> 02:49:48.949]  And I've confirmed, Stuart, they have military dressed up all over the country now, helping carry out federal takeovers of property.
[02:49:48.949 --> 02:49:50.291]  Have you gotten any info on that?
[02:49:51.269 --> 02:49:52.710]  No, not here in Montana.
[02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:53.890]  And there was nobody there.
[02:49:53.890 --> 02:49:57.512]  Only the volunteers and us veterans who were there to help him get his stuff out.
[02:49:57.512 --> 02:49:58.853]  Oh, that's why they didn't show up.
[02:49:58.853 --> 02:50:09.739]  No, I'm just saying, around the country we've confirmed that they're trying to... I'm sure you saw the head of the Army two weeks ago in the CFR called for garrisoning regular troops in every city.
[02:50:09.739 --> 02:50:10.239]  Yes, I did.
[02:50:10.239 --> 02:50:11.039]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:50:11.039 --> 02:50:12.420]  Just amazing times to be alive.
[02:50:14.434 --> 02:50:18.055]  I mean, I'd like to get you on sometime just to talk about that rescue operation.
[02:50:18.055 --> 02:50:28.739]  But, you know, way back then in 1945, rescuing those thousands of people, could you ever have imagined that they'd be trying to take your homestead?
[02:50:28.739 --> 02:50:32.201]  No way.
[02:50:32.201 --> 02:50:41.104]  I was fighting for people to save their lives and for this country and the freedom and the Constitution.
[02:50:41.104 --> 02:50:42.985]  And it's been totally reversed on me.
[02:50:45.589 --> 02:50:51.252]  Well, that's why we had laws against taking people's homestead because of these criminal carpetbaggers.
[02:50:51.252 --> 02:50:52.633]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:50:52.633 --> 02:50:56.596]  But now we're a nation, we are a nation ruled by carpetbagging banksters.
[02:50:56.596 --> 02:50:57.576]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Stuart.
[02:50:57.576 --> 02:50:59.757]  Well, that's a good point.
[02:50:59.757 --> 02:51:03.660]  The founders put bankruptcy in place to help people who were in financial trouble.
[02:51:03.660 --> 02:51:05.801]  And now it's being turned into a weapon.
[02:51:05.801 --> 02:51:07.582]  And these banks are like a bunch of pirates.
[02:51:07.582 --> 02:51:09.783]  And these trustees are the same way.
[02:51:09.783 --> 02:51:12.685]  They get bailed out, but Ren gets no mercy.
[02:51:12.685 --> 02:51:13.726]  And I wanted to ask Ren.
[02:51:15.370 --> 02:51:18.553]  If you had been captured by the Japanese, you know what they did to POWs.
[02:51:18.553 --> 02:51:28.604]  Let me ask, would you rather be captured by the Japanese and tortured and starved, or would you rather have happened to you what just happened to you just now, being forced to dig your wife's body up?
[02:51:28.604 --> 02:51:31.127]  Which one do you think is worse?
[02:51:31.127 --> 02:51:32.628]  I missed part of what you said.
[02:51:32.628 --> 02:51:34.410]  I guess we're... Let me ask you this.
[02:51:34.410 --> 02:51:35.171]  Oh, wait, wait.
[02:51:35.171 --> 02:51:36.793]  Have you already had to dig your wife up, sir?
[02:51:38.274 --> 02:51:40.537]  No, I have not yet.
[02:51:40.537 --> 02:51:44.801]  Well, I would understand if I'd have been captured by the Japanese because we were in war.
[02:51:44.801 --> 02:51:45.522]  I would have understood.
[02:51:59.679 --> 02:52:01.240]  Well, see, here's the big lie.
[02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:05.523]  They hound you and push you to pay off medical bills, I was told, is what a lot of it is.
[02:52:05.523 --> 02:52:09.886]  Well, you can't... I mean, medical bills are not supposed to hound you for those to begin with.
[02:52:24.535 --> 02:52:29.438]  And, you know, here you are, people locally make a business all over the country out of taking old folks' homes.
[02:52:29.438 --> 02:52:30.859]  I've seen it myself.
[02:52:30.859 --> 02:52:47.269]  And then you get manipulated into this, and now because you had some silver coins set aside as your emergency backup, and you live in a modest home, a modest piece of property, they're trying now, threatening you with prison, to induce you to waive your rights to get the property.
[02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:52.712]  I mean, if that isn't racketeering right there from just what I've seen, I don't know what is, Stuart Rhodes.
[02:52:54.090 --> 02:52:55.431]  Well, I think it is.
[02:52:55.431 --> 02:52:58.292]  I think it's, like I said, it's elder abuse.
[02:52:58.292 --> 02:53:01.033]  It's a systematic pressuring.
[02:53:01.033 --> 02:53:02.973]  I mean, this is not justice.
[02:53:02.973 --> 02:53:09.356]  A government lawyer, under the ethics rules for lawyers, their first obligation is to do justice.
[02:53:10.189 --> 02:53:14.911]  If he did something that he should not have done, if he should have disclosed assets, fine.
[02:53:14.911 --> 02:53:16.771]  But don't give him the bankruptcy.
[02:53:16.771 --> 02:53:20.532]  Have him pay his creditors out of that money, out of those coins.
[02:53:20.532 --> 02:53:22.093]  That is justice.
[02:53:22.093 --> 02:53:32.216]  To go from that and go forward and then take his home, take his land, force him to dig up his wife's body so he can be buried next to her someplace else, that is not justice.
[02:53:32.216 --> 02:53:33.156]  That's brutality.
[02:53:33.156 --> 02:53:34.316]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:53:34.316 --> 02:53:35.497]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:53:35.497 --> 02:53:37.077]  Oh, go ahead.
[02:53:37.077 --> 02:53:39.018]  How many coins did you have, Ren?
[02:53:44.053 --> 02:53:44.933]  I don't think you can hear me.
[02:53:44.933 --> 02:53:49.514]  Ren, can you hear me?
[02:53:49.514 --> 02:53:50.414]  We'll call him back.
[02:53:50.414 --> 02:53:52.255]  He's out there in the middle of nowhere in Montana.
[02:53:52.255 --> 02:53:53.355]  We'll call him back.
[02:53:53.355 --> 02:53:54.775]  Stewart, do you know how many coins there were?
[02:53:54.775 --> 02:53:57.876]  Because like you said, they should have just said, use these to pay off creditors.
[02:53:57.876 --> 02:54:01.116]  I think he had a pretty good stack.
[02:54:01.116 --> 02:54:05.017]  He had like, I believe it was like 600 coins, 600 ounces.
[02:54:05.017 --> 02:54:07.578]  So he had a pretty good, I'm not sure though.
[02:54:07.578 --> 02:54:09.638]  But one thing about it is the person that
[02:54:10.327 --> 02:54:11.067]  That's what's happening here.
[02:54:27.273 --> 02:54:27.914]  You're kidding?
[02:54:27.914 --> 02:54:29.975]  No, I'm serious.
[02:54:29.975 --> 02:54:30.756]  Oh my God.
[02:54:30.756 --> 02:54:31.917]  Well, what is that?
[02:54:31.917 --> 02:54:41.264]  I mean, that is, this country is just... And Ren asserts that this man also stole, I believe, about 60 ounces of silver from him.
[02:54:41.264 --> 02:54:46.688]  So I don't think of the exact figure from Ren, but he thinks the guy, you know, it came back lighter than what he gave him.
[02:54:47.595 --> 02:54:51.137]  Oh my gosh, so he's a trusting old veteran.
[02:54:51.137 --> 02:54:54.700]  Man, who are these people that prey on old people?
[02:54:54.700 --> 02:55:00.824]  And I'm sure you've seen all the Time Magazine and Newsweeks talking bad about old people and how they need to be done away with.
[02:55:00.824 --> 02:55:07.368]  I mean, this country's run by a bunch of demonic, snaggletooth, snot-nosed yuppies, I'm telling you right now.
[02:55:08.775 --> 02:55:09.656]  Well, that's like ghouls.
[02:55:09.656 --> 02:55:14.020]  That's what really upsets me is that this shouldn't be done to anybody, first of all.
[02:55:14.020 --> 02:55:15.582]  Any elderly person.
[02:55:15.582 --> 02:55:21.888]  But to do this to a war hero like this, a guy who gave up everything to go fight for his country.
[02:55:22.849 --> 02:55:30.436]  Well, the whole system is primed for these ghouls to work it.
[02:55:30.436 --> 02:55:32.078]  We've got Ren back, his phone cut out.
[02:55:32.078 --> 02:55:34.941]  Ren, anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[02:55:34.941 --> 02:55:36.162]  Anything we can do for you?
[02:55:36.162 --> 02:55:41.627]  I mean, I know the veterans are trying to hang out there and, you know, be with you, but I mean, I guess they could come at any time.
[02:55:41.627 --> 02:55:44.610]  We need to give, you know, the name of the town.
[02:55:44.610 --> 02:55:47.112]  I mean, is there anything anybody can do?
[02:55:47.112 --> 02:55:47.933]  Any ideas, Ren?
[02:55:49.127 --> 02:56:00.113]  Well, we're totally kicked out of our home and almost everything, a few items we did not get that was outside as of last night.
[02:56:00.113 --> 02:56:07.176]  The biggest thing, we all need to stand up for our freedom and for the Constitution of this country.
[02:56:07.176 --> 02:56:10.298]  If we don't stand up and start standing up now en masse,
[02:56:11.118 --> 02:56:14.901]  We'll all be treated like I have been treated over the last few months.
[02:56:14.901 --> 02:56:18.243]  No, he has no connection with the people that are getting the house at all.
[02:56:18.243 --> 02:56:19.104]  He's my former stepson.
[02:56:19.104 --> 02:56:24.308]  No, Ren, the other guy, Richard, that was helping you with the silver, wasn't it his girlfriend?
[02:56:39.062 --> 02:56:39.882]  What a nice fella!
[02:56:58.871 --> 02:56:59.631]  Yeah.
[02:56:59.631 --> 02:57:07.155]  And then this other guy that was helping with the silver, he also went to the court and said, I know where the silver is.
[02:57:07.155 --> 02:57:11.978]  Let me tell you, as this country unravels, it's going to get bad.
[02:57:11.978 --> 02:57:14.379]  Can you imagine all the rats running around out there, Stuart?
[02:57:15.410 --> 02:57:16.331]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[02:57:16.331 --> 02:57:19.473]  There's no more honor in this country and no more sense of justice.
[02:57:19.473 --> 02:57:26.078]  And people just do... I mean, not everybody, but there's so many like this who just do whatever it takes to get something for themselves.
[02:57:26.078 --> 02:57:27.039]  And they act like pirates.
[02:57:27.039 --> 02:57:32.062]  Yeah, it'd be one thing if you ratted somebody out, an old man, because you thought they were supposed to turn in some silver.
[02:57:32.062 --> 02:57:32.803]  I wouldn't do that.
[02:57:32.803 --> 02:57:33.664]  That's dirty.
[02:57:33.664 --> 02:57:40.849]  But to do it for yourself... Those folks are buying so much bad luck with what they've done, they might as well be Judas Iscariot.
[02:57:41.997 --> 02:57:43.138]  That's right.
[02:57:43.138 --> 02:57:47.280]  How many ounces of silver do you believe this man stole from you?
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:49.262]  How many ounces of silver?
[02:57:49.262 --> 02:57:52.044]  I've had a total of 1,300 ounces stolen from me.
[02:57:52.044 --> 02:57:54.045]  I had a total of 2,600 ounces of silver.
[02:58:01.136 --> 02:58:14.594]  One part of this last part is that it was supposed to have been a friend and that husband or whatever the gal is buying the property, they stole 360 ounces of silver while it was in their hands before it went to the court.
[02:58:14.594 --> 02:58:16.677]  And my stepson that was in the
[02:58:17.995 --> 02:58:23.658]  He took care of my house when I took my wife to the clinic when she had the cancer.
[02:58:23.658 --> 02:58:26.160]  That was the first silver that was missing.
[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:27.440]  It was in his car.
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:28.081]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:28.081 --> 02:58:30.142]  I wonder where they got the money to buy the house.
[02:58:30.142 --> 02:58:31.282]  I tell you what.
[02:58:31.282 --> 02:58:31.783]  One minute break.
[02:58:31.783 --> 02:58:35.585]  We're going to come right back and finish up with both these gentlemen back in 60 seconds.
[02:58:35.585 --> 02:58:37.706]  This needs to be investigated right now.
[02:58:37.706 --> 02:58:39.127]  The story's at Infowars.com.
[02:58:39.127 --> 02:58:44.270]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.221 --> 02:58:51.123]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.123 --> 02:58:52.424]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.424 --> 02:58:58.026]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:58.026 --> 02:59:03.028]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:03.028 --> 02:59:08.070]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:59:08.610 --> 02:59:13.836]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:13.836 --> 02:59:16.158]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:59:16.158 --> 02:59:20.944]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:20.944 --> 02:59:22.065]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:22.065 --> 02:59:25.148]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:59:25.148 --> 02:59:28.432]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:28.752 --> 02:59:31.936]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:31.936 --> 02:59:34.158]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:34.158 --> 02:59:35.099]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:35.099 --> 02:59:35.299]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:35.299 --> 02:59:38.743]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:38.743 --> 02:59:40.505]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:51.997 --> 02:59:55.581]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.581 --> 02:59:58.904]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:58.904 --> 03:00:01.026]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:01.026 --> 03:00:02.507]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.659 --> 03:00:16.863]  Alright, coming up, we're going to be breaking down Obama saying he is a dictator, basically.
[03:00:16.863 --> 03:00:18.605]  He can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants.
[03:00:18.605 --> 03:00:20.766]  Wars, legalizing illegals.
[03:00:20.766 --> 03:00:25.510]  Warren C. Boedeker goes by Wren.
[03:00:25.510 --> 03:00:31.335]  World War II war hero, rescued more than 2,000 people in the Los Banos raid.
[03:00:31.335 --> 03:00:35.058]  He's out in Montana, and this stuff's going on everywhere.
[03:00:35.058 --> 03:00:37.920]  And they're claiming because he kept some silver in a bankruptcy.
[03:00:39.611 --> 03:00:40.711]  No, I didn't.
[03:00:40.711 --> 03:00:47.734]  And that silver and gold that we've collected over all those years, we never spent one dime for buying anything.
[03:00:47.734 --> 03:00:51.355]  When we needed a car, I let my teeth go, everything.
[03:00:51.355 --> 03:00:54.276]  Because that was for our future when we got old age.
[03:00:54.276 --> 03:00:55.196]  The home was built for that.
[03:01:08.615 --> 03:01:14.241]  With no steps or anything, it was built strictly for our retirement and old age.
[03:01:14.241 --> 03:01:15.903]  Yeah, I know there's been some federal rulings.
[03:01:15.903 --> 03:01:20.608]  You can calculate the value of that of what you bought it in at the time, too, so it's probably a lot reduced.
[03:01:20.608 --> 03:01:22.270]  But the point is, you didn't know.
[03:01:22.270 --> 03:01:23.932]  Stewart, where do we go from here?
[03:01:23.932 --> 03:01:27.536]  I would think that we need the local police if they've got any honor.
[03:01:27.536 --> 03:01:29.177]  This is the feds doing this.
[03:01:29.998 --> 03:01:36.300]  They should dig into these other people, get warrants, look at deposits, silver sold.
[03:01:36.300 --> 03:01:45.062]  I would go around to local places, even in towns a hundred miles away, and get records of the silver sold with warrants to see if they were indeed selling his silver.
[03:01:45.062 --> 03:01:47.882]  And then you could build a case backing up what he's saying.
[03:01:47.882 --> 03:01:53.064]  This was an organized deception the whole time, planning to get him into bankruptcy to do this.
[03:01:53.064 --> 03:01:57.445]  Again, I don't know all this, but that's what my gut hound dog tells me to look into.
[03:01:57.445 --> 03:01:58.665]  What do you say to that right there?
[03:01:59.414 --> 03:02:01.836]  Well, there's two different strategies of attack on this.
[03:02:01.836 --> 03:02:04.919]  On the one hand, he needs a really good bankruptcy lawyer.
[03:02:04.919 --> 03:02:15.007]  We've got an appointment set with him to go see a psychologist who's going to do an assessment of his capacity to see whether he could understand what he was agreeing to.
[03:02:15.007 --> 03:02:19.511]  So we'll attack the stipulation and try to wipe that out and then put him back where he was.
[03:02:20.171 --> 03:02:24.275]  Back with his homestead, and then they can then try to go ahead and do an adversarial proceeding.
[03:02:24.275 --> 03:02:25.636]  We'll fight them all the way.
[03:02:25.636 --> 03:02:31.402]  But the other strategy, I mean, it'd be nice to have somebody look into the theft of his silver, but I think that's a second issue.
[03:02:31.402 --> 03:02:33.364]  So we need a two-pronged strategy there.
[03:02:33.364 --> 03:02:40.030]  And we also had folks contact us, friends of mine through Oath Keepers, who were trying to raise the money to buy his house back.
[03:02:40.230 --> 03:02:44.935]  Yeah, that's all great, but I mean, if we try to always buy people out of their trouble, you know, it's a losing battle.
[03:02:44.935 --> 03:02:46.796]  It's important in this case to help them.
[03:02:46.796 --> 03:02:51.321]  I think bringing the people involved in this to justice if they've done something wrong, I think that's what's important.
[03:03:04.721 --> 03:03:08.483]  Well, sure, if he can, but this is, you know, this is why I don't mess with the law much.
[03:03:08.483 --> 03:03:13.025]  It's such a corrupt system and it's already so far gone.
[03:03:13.025 --> 03:03:25.751]  I mean, the court let this trustee hire herself as the lawyer for the trustee and for the estate and said, in its order, allowing this, that she's not biased, that she has no conflict of interest.
[03:03:25.751 --> 03:03:27.332]  This is ridiculous.
[03:03:27.332 --> 03:03:30.193]  And so the law in this country has deteriorated into being a weapon.
[03:03:30.693 --> 03:03:37.639]  And so, I don't think there's, you know, in the big picture, I don't think anybody involved in this is going to be, you know, prosecuted for anything.
[03:03:37.639 --> 03:03:39.821]  But we can restore his homestead.
[03:03:39.821 --> 03:03:41.162]  I think that's possible.
[03:03:41.162 --> 03:03:43.744]  You know, it was Montana with that weird Hardin stuff.
[03:03:43.744 --> 03:03:45.906]  A lot of weirdness going on up there.
[03:03:45.906 --> 03:03:51.691]  I know it's a lot of good people, but also has that weird old mining thing going on.
[03:03:51.691 --> 03:03:54.253]  In closing, Wren, anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[03:03:55.393 --> 03:04:12.963]  Well, I was just thinking as you were talking there, you know, you and Stuart Rhodes and the Oath Keepers, all of you that's taking a hand and helping me here, whether you realize it or not, you're making a combat jump into enemy territory just like I did.
[03:04:12.963 --> 03:04:15.524]  No, no we're not.
[03:04:15.524 --> 03:04:18.966]  Listen, we just know that if people are feeding on old folks, none of us are safe.
[03:04:18.966 --> 03:04:22.689]  So, it's real simple.
[03:04:22.689 --> 03:04:24.930]  I thank you for the time that you've spent with me.
[03:04:26.215 --> 03:04:27.877]  Look forward to hearing more from you.
[03:04:44.471 --> 03:04:45.032]  Yes, they can.
[03:04:45.032 --> 03:04:46.333]  They can go there to donate.
[03:04:46.333 --> 03:04:49.155]  It's directly to Wren's legal defense fund.
[03:04:49.155 --> 03:04:49.716]  No, no, no.
[03:04:49.716 --> 03:04:51.117]  He needs legal defense right now.
[03:04:51.117 --> 03:04:52.458]  Great job, Stuart.
[03:04:52.458 --> 03:04:56.442]  And I'll get a hold of my lawyer, too, and maybe get you guys on the phone.
[03:04:56.442 --> 03:04:57.563]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[03:04:57.563 --> 03:04:58.263]  Alright, thank you.
[03:04:58.263 --> 03:04:59.004]  Big news coming up.
