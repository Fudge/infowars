[00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.024]  Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting.
[00:00:13.844 --> 00:00:18.628]  This notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.
[00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:21.249]  We are doing everything we can administratively.
[00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.491]  There are laws on the books that I have to enforce.
[00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:28.755]  There's been a great disservice done to the cause of getting
[00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:39.610]  The Dream Act passed and getting comprehensive immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow, by myself, I can go and do these things.
[00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:41.511]  It's just not true.
[00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:42.812]  We live in a democracy.
[00:00:43.412 --> 00:00:48.534]  You have to pass bills through the legislature and then I can sign it.
[00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:57.997]  And if all the attention is focused away from the legislative process, then
[00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:01.370]  That is going to lead to a constant dead end.
[00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:06.414]  These last few years we've seen an unacceptable abuse of power.
[00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:10.417]  Having a president whose priority is expanding his own power.
[00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:12.939]  Any guess on who said that?
[00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.143]  Mr. Speaker, it was Senator Barack Obama.
[00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:19.051]  Here's another one.
[00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:24.633]  No law can give Congress a backbone if it refuses to stand up as a co-equal branch.
[00:01:25.213 --> 00:01:26.434]  The Constitution made it.
[00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.675]  Senator Barack Obama.
[00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:39.798]  What do we do with a president who can basically change what Congress passed by attaching a letter saying, I don't agree with this part or that part?
[00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:43.859]  Senator Barack Obama.
[00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.120]  What if the whole purpose of government was to negate freedom?
[00:01:48.032 --> 00:01:49.117]  What if freedom was a myth?
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.289]  What if the Constitution meant nothing to the government?
[00:01:53.032 --> 00:01:56.273]  What if everything the government has or owns or controls has been stolen?
[00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:02.276]  So wherever and whenever I can go ahead and help families like yours, I've got the legal authority to do it.
[00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:03.236]  I'm going to do it.
[00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:17.122]  On the subject of immigration, later today we'll have a press conference with some members who are urging the president to act, to use his executive authority to improve the situation.
[00:02:17.922 --> 00:02:20.903]  The president not only has the legal authority to act,
[00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:29.108]  About all the precedents of presidents before, from Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon.
[00:02:29.308 --> 00:02:35.849]  You know most of them before you were born, some of you, but Nixon, Ford, Carter.
[00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.790]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president.
[00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.671]  The same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:52.192]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.743]  What you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law.
[00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:26.536]  Now, this is an issue not really focusing on immigration, but instead is an issue about how the President is violating the Constitution by imposing his own powers that really reside with Congress.
[00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:40.363]  So we certainly are hopeful that Congress is going to view this as a motivation, you might say, to try to take action finally on common sense, comprehensive immigration reform that'd be good for border security, that'd be good for national security.
[00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:46.784]  What I'd like to see the President do is finally acknowledge all of the people that have been killed by illegal aliens.
[00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:48.864]  This is not a story about my son.
[00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:56.886]  This is a story about over 100,000 people that have been killed since the last amnesty and are getting killed at the rate of 5,000 a year.
[00:03:57.206 --> 00:04:08.428]  Most of them, about 60%, are being killed by people that are in the country illegally but have not committed any what the administration calls serious crimes.
[00:04:08.908 --> 00:04:14.932]  These borders being wide open, it's not just the people from Mexico and South America who are coming across our borders now.
[00:04:15.192 --> 00:04:17.293]  There are bigger issues that we need to be worried about.
[00:04:18.294 --> 00:04:21.015]  And there's no time spent in jail for most of these felons.
[00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:38.526]  In 2013, they released over 36,000, not 300 or 3,000, 36,000 illegals from our jails and detention centers to go back onto our streets and commit more crimes because there is no protocol with the government of how they're handling these criminals.
[00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:44.767]  You told the world that you were going to deport these four people with ties to terrorist organizations.
[00:04:45.047 --> 00:04:46.008]  That's not what happened.
[00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:48.168]  Two of them were released.
[00:04:48.408 --> 00:04:50.149]  They're in deportation proceedings.
[00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.550]  An immigration judge released two of the four.
[00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.510]  And they fled to Canada.
[00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.471]  My intent is that they be deported.
[00:05:01.671 --> 00:05:03.812]  But two of them are in Canada seeking asylum.
[00:05:04.482 --> 00:05:09.186]  Where did these two, where were they anticipated going and where did they actually go?
[00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.388]  I'm not sure of their exact whereabouts, sir.
[00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.129]  Mr. Secretary, this is the problem.
[00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:21.415]  You come and you say, you tell the world that you're going to deport these four people tied to terror.
[00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:22.435]  These are terrorists!
[00:05:23.316 --> 00:05:23.856]  And you don't!
[00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:24.757]  They get released!
[00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:28.140]  They go to, my understanding is, they go to Arizona.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.081]  They go to the state of Washington.
[00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.002]  They cross illegally into Canada.
[00:05:32.282 --> 00:05:34.904]  They each put up $25,000 bonds.
[00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:40.548]  Doesn't that beg a lot of questions about what you're doing in deporting criminals?
[00:05:40.628 --> 00:05:42.129]  These people have terrorist ties.
[00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:50.054]  And I'm getting tired of the Democrats with this righteous indignation saying that we can't find a Congress we can work with.
[00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:57.917]  Well, the first two years of the Obama administration, the Democrats had the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and they did nothing on immigration.
[00:05:58.057 --> 00:05:59.298]  I sat on the subcommittee.
[00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:01.799]  They brought Stephen Colbert in to testify.
[00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:02.819]  That's how bad it was.
[00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:10.422]  It is confusing, and it poses a bit of a hypocrisy, I think, to the American people, because then after the election, he reversed his course.
[00:06:11.525 --> 00:06:16.848]  After the election, he says that now he does have the legal authority to move forward.
[00:06:17.388 --> 00:06:19.710]  And so we don't know, who should we believe?
[00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.192]  The president before the election who said he didn't have legal authority to take this action?
[00:06:25.213 --> 00:06:30.616]  Or the president after the election who says that he does have the authority to take this executive action?
[00:06:32.383 --> 00:06:42.687]  Congressman, what I know is we spent months developing these reforms, and we spent a lot of time with lawyers, very close consultation with lawyers.
[00:06:42.707 --> 00:06:54.831]  There were some things that they told us they thought we did not have the legal authority to do, which is reflected in the OLC opinion, and there were things they told us very clearly that we did have the legal authority to do.
[00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:58.652]  The analysis was very thoughtful, very time-consuming.
[00:06:59.341 --> 00:07:10.265]  I have no doubt with respect to your integrity, but I think the timing of these statements makes it look more political to me, that this is a political decision rather than a policy decision.
[00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.806]  Nearly 20 million Americans woke up this morning either
[00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:30.591]  Unemployed or underemployed.
[00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:40.954]  Now the President didn't mention these Americans when he announced his plan to grant de facto amnesty and work permits to up to 5 million illegal immigrants.
[00:07:41.715 --> 00:07:48.657]  He didn't discuss the competition this would create for them or the impact it would have on their pocketbooks.
[00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:56.939]  And your series of memoranda outlining this policy for him didn't mention them either.
[00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:11.528]  To address this problem and protect the American worker, I introduced legislation prior to the President's announcement that would make clear that illegal immigrants benefiting from his executive amnesty are not authorized to work in the United States.
[00:08:12.528 --> 00:08:20.571]  When it comes to illegal immigration, the conversation is always about the illegal immigrant, not about the people that it will affect.
[00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:24.032]  And you see, Mr. Secretary, I don't think it's fair.
[00:08:25.643 --> 00:08:31.326]  Especially around the holidays to put illegal immigrants ahead of the American worker.
[00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:38.569]  Secretary Johnson, the President, keeps saying that his executive action will boost the economy.
[00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:50.574]  So tell me, how will adding at least 5 million new competitors to the workforce make it easier for the unemployed Americans to find a job?
[00:08:52.981 --> 00:09:00.850]  Congressman, the fact is, as I'm sure you know, that we have lots of undocumented in this country working off the books.
[00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:07.537]  And if that's not apparent, then I suggest you spend some time in a restaurant here in the Washington, D.C.
[00:09:07.597 --> 00:09:09.359]  area to see it for yourself.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.804]  What we want to do is encourage those people to get on the books.
[00:09:14.953 --> 00:09:19.955]  And I will provide them a work authorization so that they may legally continue in the environment.
[00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:21.876]  But how does that make it easier for the American worker?
[00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:23.256]  We keep talking about the illegal immigrant.
[00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:26.758]  Here we go again, talking about the illegal immigrant and how we can make it easier for them.
[00:09:27.238 --> 00:09:32.040]  How does this help the American worker who can't find work and can't provide for his family?
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.380]  Who's fighting for them?
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:40.983]  My question for you, Mr. Secretary, is what do you say to someone who believes the President took action to change the law?
[00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:44.575]  We did not change the law.
[00:09:44.735 --> 00:09:45.796]  We acted within the law.
[00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:48.016]  Can you play the clip?
[00:09:48.036 --> 00:09:49.837]  This is from November 25th.
[00:09:50.077 --> 00:09:53.838]  This is the President in Nevada talking about this.
[00:09:54.578 --> 00:10:01.039]  What you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.961]  So you say he didn't change the law, but the President says he changed the law.
[00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:08.341]  We acted within existing law.
[00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:11.382]  We acted within our existing legal authority.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.202]  Listen, I've been a lawyer 30 years.
[00:10:13.242 --> 00:10:18.068]  Somebody plays me an 8 word excerpt from a broader speech, I know to be suspicious.
[00:10:18.588 --> 00:10:26.298]  At one point he said, I just took action to change the law.
[00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:33.925]  Did the president misspeak in a moment of sort of passion to try to calm the crowd?
[00:10:34.145 --> 00:10:40.471]  Or does he fundamentally, and do you fundamentally believe that he has taken action to change the law?
[00:10:40.631 --> 00:10:42.012]  I think he was speaking colloquially.
[00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:49.239]  What you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law.
[00:10:56.738 --> 00:10:59.000]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
