[00:00:01.631 --> 00:00:10.739]  As citizens in New York refuse to register their weapons with politicians who have armed bodyguards, new schemes to infringe upon Second Amendment rights are already in the works.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.504]  The Justice Department is clamoring for American gun owners to have smart guns.
[00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:21.649]  Smart guns that wouldn't operate without biometrics and or some type of proximity device such as a watch.
[00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.250]  You may say, well, what's wrong with that?
[00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:32.352]  In Iowa, a father was forced to leave a gun range because the state said his daughters were too young to fire a handgun even with adult supervision.
[00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:35.892]  You may also be saying, guns and children don't mix.
[00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:38.973]  A child should never be allowed anywhere near a gun.
[00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:44.034]  A male enters, he has a gun in his hand, and he points it toward this young man.
[00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:49.295]  At that point, the young man fired his handgun at the suspect, and the suspect was hit.
[00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:55.519]  It surprised me a little bit, you know, that he would do something like this, but I'm glad he did.
[00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.739]  I'm glad his father trained him for this.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.121]  When I was back there on the phone with 911, I heard the bathroom light turn on that was leading to the closet.
[00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:11.883]  And when I saw the door handle turn, I shot him.
[00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:16.785]  I guess it went through the door and went through him and went through the wall.
[00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:24.354]  A 15-year-old boy and his 12-year-old sister had been home alone in the Mount Royal Village subdivision.
[00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:30.657]  At about 2.30, a pair of home invaders tried the front and back doors, then broke a back window.
[00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:34.839]  The brother grabbed his father's assault rifle and knew what to do with it.
[00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.481]  Two suspects showed up at Tombow Hospital.
[00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:42.023]  One, the adult, had multiple gunshot wounds and was flown to Memorial Hermann Hospital.
[00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:51.089]  But under laws such as those in Iowa, those children wouldn't have been able to defend themselves, especially if the weapons they used were their parents' registered smart guns.
[00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.035]  So as the establishment continues to put perfume on the pig known as gun control, remind them that the Second Amendment shall not be infringed.
