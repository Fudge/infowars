[00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.611]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:07.371]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:09.152]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:10.733]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.253]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:16.454]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:20.576]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.213 --> 00:00:47.159]  Well, as usual, last night, this morning, and now sitting here in front of all these stories going over, and before we went live moments ago, I don't know where to start, because there's just so much crazy, out-of-control news going on.
[00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.842]  You never know when the public's going to have their attention captured by corruption.
[00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:59.985]  Huge, horrible things can go on for a long time, and then suddenly the straw breaks the camel's back.
[00:01:01.798 --> 00:01:15.245]  But the cover-up of the death list, now going back to 2008, of veterans at the VA hospital system is really making the public angry.
[00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:18.767]  And my point is, are you angry about that?
[00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:30.834]  More than you're angry about the Pentagon, Homeland Security, and local police departments publicly training to take on veterans and gun owners, saying they're the number one enemy, the number one threat?
[00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:35.703]  I mean, that's Twilight Zone level.
[00:01:35.703 --> 00:01:39.625]  And I use that term Twilight Zone Outer Limits because it's such a big deal.
[00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:43.247]  And this is starting to capture people's attention.
[00:01:43.247 --> 00:01:54.293]  After we covered it last week and DrugsReport.com carried it Sunday and Monday, there are a bunch of news articles in local newspapers responding
[00:01:56.121 --> 00:02:02.386]  As the media, the local media, that's mainstream media, but more alternative because at least they report some important stories.
[00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:03.947]  They're not totally controlled.
[00:02:03.947 --> 00:02:09.051]  I'm a bigger fan of local mainstream media than I am of national, globalist, state-run media.
[00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:11.213]  But still they regurgitate so much of it.
[00:02:11.213 --> 00:02:13.495]  It's a hybrid of the two in my view.
[00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:16.777]  Police site protection is need for heavily armored truck.
[00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:18.619]  That's out of the Northwestern newspaper.
[00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.921]  And I've got several others here.
[00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:21.941]  Wisconsin police
[00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:27.783]  Reassure residents they won't be shot at from military truck.
[00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:33.067]  And so, we're starting to force a debate about this.
[00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:46.577]  Kind of like, four months ago, I sent Jakari Jackson and crew out to the West Coast because of increased radiation levels, and they cited our report in a bunch of newspapers.
[00:02:48.243 --> 00:03:01.612]  As the reason that the news started to cover it, and now the Navy's involved, the Department of Energy's involved, and is confirming all sorts of increased radiation, different isotopes associated with Fukushima, but also illegal dumping all over the West Coast.
[00:03:01.612 --> 00:03:03.274]  And again, I'm not bragging.
[00:03:03.274 --> 00:03:07.877]  Hey, we reported on something and now, you know, it's getting picked up.
[00:03:10.137 --> 00:03:12.198]  I'm saying you have that power too.
[00:03:12.198 --> 00:03:22.264]  The issue is when dinosaur media won't cover serious issues, we can't just sit there and complain and say, you know, they're setting the agenda.
[00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:29.529]  We have to go out and start our own YouTube channels, AXS TV shows, local radio shows.
[00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.490]  That's how you get a syndicated radio show.
[00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.871]  The Journey of a Thousand Miles starts with a single step.
[00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:36.853]  If you go out with a camera and report on things with your own Geiger counter,
[00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:46.317]  Or if you go out and report on crime in your area, you'll end up having a bigger audience than mainstream media because you're reporting on what you think is important.
[00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:47.698]  And guess what?
[00:03:47.698 --> 00:03:51.922]  Nine times out of ten, it's going to resonate with other people in your area.
[00:03:51.922 --> 00:03:55.846]  And your goal isn't to have a website with a bunch of traffic and just make money.
[00:03:55.846 --> 00:04:02.632]  But it's good to go out, have your advocacy for truth and justice, and make money to fund a better platform.
[00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:06.508]  The two things go together like a horse and carriage.
[00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:14.478]  That's why the White House memos that came out from Clinton a few months ago and the rest of it point to the fact that the system is obsessed
[00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:34.735]  With any type of economy, be it media, be it food, information, whatever it is, they don't want you going to farmers markets, they don't want you buying milk from Amish, they don't want you starting your own website, they don't want you supporting a local independent radio show, they don't want you to do that because they want to control the whole game and have you only go through their system.
[00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:40.459]  We start revolutionary thought of just changing our activities, our behavior, a little bit.
[00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:44.500]  And it'll shift the whole paradigm, because people are so hungry for that.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.341]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:48.504]  Huge news on China and a web war.
[00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:51.967]  Huge news on an invasion of Libya.
[00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:54.149]  China and Vietnam on the edge of war.
[00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:57.652]  I mean, the world's going into hyperdrive like I told you it would.
[00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:00.492]  I don't know what it is.
[00:05:00.492 --> 00:05:02.373]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[00:05:02.373 --> 00:05:06.496]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[00:05:06.496 --> 00:05:08.097]  It's like I don't even exist.
[00:05:08.097 --> 00:05:10.039]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.420]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.142]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[00:05:14.142 --> 00:05:19.566]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:24.630]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.332]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:27.772]  Look it up.
[00:05:27.992 --> 00:05:34.879]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.021]  Security.
[00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:07.541]  Alert.

[00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:19.363]  Prime Directive.
[00:06:19.363 --> 00:06:20.944]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:23.844]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:23.844 --> 00:06:26.945]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:31.007]  I don't know what he is, except a conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:33.228]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:06:33.228 --> 00:06:35.909]  They are never going to stop.
[00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.011]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:06:48.096 --> 00:06:50.197]  Deploy prison senate TV.
[00:06:50.197 --> 00:06:52.918]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about the enemy.
[00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:57.076]  Well actually, it's for kind, you can feel it!
[00:06:59.187 --> 00:07:03.229]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:07.590]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.252]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:07:11.252 --> 00:07:14.293]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:07:14.293 --> 00:07:21.876]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:25.497]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:07:25.717 --> 00:07:30.180]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:36.165]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:40.127]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:42.849]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:44.350]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.711]  It's time to take action.
[00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:47.553]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:08:20.632 --> 00:08:23.936]  Central, we are here live.
[00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:27.541]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:30.044]  Sundays, we have the live transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:30.044 --> 00:08:32.047]  Central, with the Sunday edition.
[00:08:32.047 --> 00:08:33.329]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:40.302]  Okay, it is an absolute total overload of news and information today.
[00:08:40.302 --> 00:08:42.544]  I'm going to do my best to cover it all.
[00:08:42.544 --> 00:08:45.906]  China halts cyber security cooperation after U.S.
[00:08:45.906 --> 00:08:48.228]  spying charges.
[00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:52.231]  That is breaking via Bloomberg right now.
[00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:56.774]  And of course there's now espionage charges that the quote U.S.
[00:08:56.774 --> 00:08:59.536]  is levying against Chinese individuals.
[00:09:00.276 --> 00:09:03.957]  China's decision to suspend its involvement in the cybersecurity working group of the U.S.
[00:09:03.957 --> 00:09:10.779]  after being accused of commercial spying threats to undo efforts aimed at finding common ground to tackle hacking.
[00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:15.121]  China halted the dialogue and threatened further retaliation after the U.S.
[00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:19.422]  indicted five Chinese military officials yesterday for allegedly stealing trade secrets.
[00:09:19.422 --> 00:09:20.922]  China's foreign ministry called the U.S.
[00:09:20.922 --> 00:09:26.264]  move a serious violation of the basic norms of international relations, while China's State Internet Information Office
[00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:41.742]  I mean, the Clintons were famous for transferring missile secrets, computer secrets, avionics to the Communist Chinese government.
[00:09:42.822 --> 00:09:44.843]  So, this is getting serious.
[00:09:44.843 --> 00:09:46.484]  China has now summoned the U.S.
[00:09:46.484 --> 00:09:47.404]  envoy.
[00:09:47.404 --> 00:09:50.486]  Reuters is reporting China summoned the U.S.
[00:09:50.486 --> 00:10:06.174]  ambassador after the United States accused five Chinese military officials of hacking into American companies to steal trade secrets, warning Washington it could take further action, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
[00:10:06.174 --> 00:10:09.936]  So, things are heating up big time right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:10.998 --> 00:10:19.144]  I'm going to play a clip in a moment of the Russian Prime Minister saying we're, quote, approaching a second Cold War.
[00:10:19.144 --> 00:10:24.267]  Notice you've got Thailand declaring martial law and shutting down the media that they don't control.
[00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:29.551]  You notice you've got China massing troops on its border with Vietnam, basically threatening to invade.
[00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:36.776]  You notice you've got all hell breaking loose in a globalist-sponsored civil war, proxy war in Ukraine.
[00:10:36.776 --> 00:10:40.399]  And we've got another Reuters headline here today.
[00:10:41.963 --> 00:10:42.544]  U.S.
[00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:47.311]  moves more forces closer to Libya as unrest grows.
[00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:58.067]  And the Lansink Medical Journal admits that it is a totally failed society run by Al-Qaeda since it was, quote, liberated three years ago by NATO backing Al-Qaeda forces.
[00:10:59.935 --> 00:11:11.967]  The only industrialized country in the North or Central Africa, South Africa is partially industrialized in some of its city areas, very high tech in some of its cities, but still kind of like a first world and then a third world.
[00:11:11.967 --> 00:11:20.656]  Africa is literally being destabilized and the globalists put Al Qaeda in charge, use it to then destabilize the whole area.
[00:11:21.477 --> 00:11:24.518]  Not just Northern Africa, but Western, Central, Eastern Africa.
[00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:27.360]  And then the answer is, move in U.S.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.922]  troops to take control of airfields for drone bases to quote, fight the Al-Qaeda they've put in charge.
[00:11:33.922 --> 00:11:40.585]  The same Al-Qaeda that was running security in Benghazi that went over during the stand down to kill the ambassador.
[00:11:40.585 --> 00:11:41.986]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:48.865]  And the Turkish head ambassador was there as well, hours before Stevens was killed.
[00:11:48.865 --> 00:11:51.786]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:11:51.786 --> 00:11:55.008]  And let me explain what a world war is.
[00:11:55.008 --> 00:11:59.011]  My lay definition.
[00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:02.313]  It's when you have multiple major powers.
[00:12:03.817 --> 00:12:09.280]  Fighting simultaneous two front wars on multiple continents.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.101]  Let's see if my definition is good.
[00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:16.164]  Guys, search engine the definition of a world war.
[00:12:16.164 --> 00:12:20.807]  But the point is, is that that's what's happening, ladies and gentlemen, and
[00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:25.528]  The first artificially intelligent computers aren't coming, they're here.
[00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:29.171]  They can predict the future in mass movements, even individual movements.
[00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:38.918]  When Amazon can predict what you're going to order before you order it, and is already having a robot package it, that's AI.
[00:12:38.918 --> 00:12:42.441]  And when you've got regional wars going on everywhere, that's a World War.
[00:12:42.441 --> 00:12:48.426]  World War III, they call the Cold War, well if this is World War IV via proxies, it's begun.
[00:12:48.426 --> 00:12:50.047]  I would say World War IV is beginning.
[00:12:52.179 --> 00:13:12.548]  Definition of World War, according to what Webster, a war engaged in by all or most of the principal nations of the world, especially capitalized both WS, either to such wars of the first of the 20th century.
[00:13:12.548 --> 00:13:13.028]  That's right.
[00:13:13.028 --> 00:13:20.371]  Major powers involved in multi-continent warfare is generally the definition that I was taught.
[00:13:20.371 --> 00:13:21.552]  But when you look at
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:28.802]  China threatening to attack Japanese islands, threatening to take Philippine islands.
[00:13:28.802 --> 00:13:32.624]  They're acting just like Japan did in the 30s.
[00:13:32.624 --> 00:13:34.745]  In the lead up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.
[00:13:34.745 --> 00:13:43.028]  When you've got China belligerently grabbing oil-rich waters off the coast of Vietnam that are not theirs.
[00:13:43.028 --> 00:13:46.569]  That's how the Japanese behaved back in the 30s.
[00:13:46.569 --> 00:13:50.051]  When they actually invaded Vietnam.
[00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:55.265]  To get the rubber trees and a bunch of other stuff and the slave labor.
[00:13:55.265 --> 00:14:00.266]  When you've got North Korea acting belligerently and constantly pulling stuff now and artillery barrages.
[00:14:00.266 --> 00:14:05.527]  When you've got the proxy war for the EU into Ukraine.
[00:14:05.527 --> 00:14:15.528]  When you've got the destabilization of the Middle East using Al-Qaeda with the US then and NATO bringing troops up in the rear.
[00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:18.409]  And you add all the other stuff that's going on around the world
[00:14:20.086 --> 00:14:22.288]  This is the beginning of World War 4.
[00:14:22.288 --> 00:14:24.590]  The Pentagon calls the Cold War World War 3.
[00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:30.034]  They say World War 3 was already fought.
[00:14:30.034 --> 00:14:42.644]  And it went on from the 50s with Korea right through up until the fall of the quote Soviet Union in the late 1980s up until 1991 and Boris Yeltsin and all the rest of it.
[00:14:42.644 --> 00:14:45.647]  But there's major resets going on right now.
[00:14:46.704 --> 00:14:51.207]  And it has to do with the global devaluation of currencies, not just the dollar.
[00:14:51.207 --> 00:14:56.010]  It has to do with, you've got inflation in some sectors, deflation in others, by design.
[00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:08.358]  You've got a managed, controlled global economy, with the Anglo-American establishment at the top, but China and Russia as major players.
[00:15:08.358 --> 00:15:09.839]  This is a serious situation.
[00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:13.346]  And I know I state the obvious here.
[00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:20.768]  You got major gas deals going on right now between Russia and China to supply China all the oil and gas they need.
[00:15:20.768 --> 00:15:22.269]  That's what's happening.
[00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:23.569]  And this is not being done.
[00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:28.851]  The globalists are not trying to destabilize Russia and China right now because they want to help America.
[00:15:28.851 --> 00:15:29.911]  They want Russia down.
[00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:31.211]  They want China down.
[00:15:31.211 --> 00:15:32.052]  They want the U.S.
[00:15:32.052 --> 00:15:32.272]  down.
[00:15:33.243 --> 00:15:38.306]  But with China as the strongest overall to be the main UN police force in the future.
[00:15:38.306 --> 00:15:45.950]  That's all been stated by David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and you can go pull up op-eds they've both written in the New York Times on that subject.
[00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.712]  Endorsing Chinese communism as the model.
[00:15:49.712 --> 00:15:55.955]  Because it isn't really communism, it's a tiny elite with slave factories everywhere calling it communism.
[00:15:55.955 --> 00:16:01.898]  In fact, the last Chinese president, before the new one came in, was in the BBC, was quoted and he said,
[00:16:03.243 --> 00:16:04.284]  I forget his name.
[00:16:04.284 --> 00:16:06.026]  I just remember reading the quote over and over again on air.
[00:16:06.026 --> 00:16:09.689]  In fact, people can probably search engine this.
[00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:17.736]  Chinese communism is the ultimate expression of pure, perfect capitalism, was the quote.
[00:16:17.736 --> 00:16:24.563]  Chinese communism, Chinese style communism, is the perfect and pure expression of capitalism.
[00:16:25.563 --> 00:16:27.704]  And people said that doesn't make any sense.
[00:16:27.704 --> 00:16:29.225]  No, no, to the globalist it does.
[00:16:29.225 --> 00:16:40.631]  It's a managed capitalism with elites offshore above the law, with inner party members over each country, worth billions and billions living in giant pleasure palaces.
[00:16:40.631 --> 00:16:49.396]  You live in a loincloth in a coffin apartment that's less than 100 square feet when they're done with you.
[00:16:49.396 --> 00:16:52.278]  They live in giant palatial palaces with guards everywhere.
[00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:53.959]  Do you understand that?
[00:16:54.878 --> 00:16:56.719]  They want you poor to control you.
[00:16:56.719 --> 00:17:06.346]  Now let's play the Russian Prime Minister coming out and saying a new Cold War is basically starting.
[00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:08.027]  Some decisions taken by the U.S.
[00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.888]  administration are disappointing.
[00:17:09.888 --> 00:17:11.869]  We have indeed done a lot for Russian-U.S.
[00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:12.830]  relations.
[00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:14.791]  I believe doing so was right.
[00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:17.733]  The agreements that were reached with America were useful.
[00:17:17.733 --> 00:17:23.117]  And I'm very sorry that everything that has been achieved is now being eliminated by those decisions.
[00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:29.242]  Basically, we are slowly but surely approaching a second Cold War that nobody needs.
[00:17:29.242 --> 00:17:30.583]  Why am I saying this?
[00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:40.552]  Because a competent politician knows how to make reserved, careful, subtle, wise and intelligent decisions, which I believe Mr. Obama succeeded at for a while.
[00:17:40.552 --> 00:17:43.615]  But what is being done now, unfortunately, proves that the U.S.
[00:17:43.615 --> 00:17:48.420]  administration has run out of those resources, and the United States is one of the parties to suffer from this.
[00:17:50.868 --> 00:17:54.989]  But the globalists want more weapons sales.
[00:17:54.989 --> 00:17:59.430]  They want Russia to have to spend its money on weapons instead of development.
[00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.871]  And then the globalists, by creating destabilization, they stand to gain.
[00:18:03.871 --> 00:18:07.691]  And I know I'm stating the obvious here, it's just that it's hiding in plain view.
[00:18:07.691 --> 00:18:14.693]  And the general public, I'm actually starting to hear anti-Russian talk in restaurants and on the streets and on talk radio.
[00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:18.694]  And it is just ultimately stupid.
[00:18:18.694 --> 00:18:20.396]  The Russians are collapsing.
[00:18:20.396 --> 00:18:22.057]  Their population is collapsing.
[00:18:22.057 --> 00:18:23.279]  The Soviet Union collapsed.
[00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:25.701]  They're just trying to get back on their feet.
[00:18:25.701 --> 00:18:30.126]  And we don't stand to gain by a Cold War with the Russians.
[00:18:30.126 --> 00:18:35.331]  Any more than we do having the Middle East destabilized and al-Qaeda put in charge everywhere.
[00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:36.432]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:18:37.458 --> 00:18:40.439]  And we'll open the phones up and get your take on this as well.
[00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:42.620]  But do you see how everything's moving at once?
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:49.363]  They're rolling out that, yeah, the domestic military and militarized police and armored vehicles and tanks is for veterans and gun owners.
[00:18:49.363 --> 00:18:50.263]  Yeah.
[00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:53.124]  Yeah, we think you're going to start blowing stuff up.
[00:18:53.124 --> 00:19:00.587]  Any moron can see that the globalists are the ones that have the motive, the history and the means to do it.
[00:19:00.587 --> 00:19:05.109]  So we're just waiting for that shoe to drop, that balloon to go up.
[00:19:05.109 --> 00:19:06.690]  I'm going to get into this Libya situation.
[00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:12.212]  We're going to get into study shows, no shortage of high-tech workers in the U.S.
[00:19:12.212 --> 00:19:14.292]  Yeah, there's a glut of high-tech workers.
[00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:16.453]  They want to drive down the wages even more.
[00:19:16.453 --> 00:19:17.313]  People say, well, that's fine.
[00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:18.193]  That's free market.
[00:19:18.193 --> 00:19:24.135]  No, it's not free market to compete with India and China that basically are in slavery.
[00:19:24.135 --> 00:19:26.335]  Or people live 20 people to a room.
[00:19:26.335 --> 00:19:27.535]  It's a race to the bottom.
[00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:28.736]  Ross Perot was right.
[00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:30.436]  It's basic economics.
[00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:34.037]  But, Canada opened up free trade with us five years ago.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.423]  Their average worker, industrial, was getting $35 an hour.
[00:19:38.423 --> 00:19:40.685]  It's $15 an hour five years later.
[00:19:40.685 --> 00:19:42.847]  Our average industrial worker, $20 an hour.
[00:19:42.847 --> 00:19:45.469]  You go to Mexico, it's gonna drop down to $10.
[00:19:45.469 --> 00:19:48.432]  Now, you want that to happen.
[00:19:48.432 --> 00:19:51.595]  This is not gonna build up society, it's gonna implode it.
[00:19:51.595 --> 00:19:55.278]  Well, I tell you what, Ross Perot was 110% correct.
[00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:57.660]  But Al Gore laughed at him, and that's all that mattered.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.102]  He was right, Al Gore.
[00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:06.207]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement.
[00:20:06.207 --> 00:20:08.308]  But only if they can detect a signal.

[00:20:29.153 --> 00:20:38.458]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:39.238]  This capitalism?
[00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:45.401]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:45.401 --> 00:20:49.103]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:22:06.516 --> 00:22:14.639]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:22:14.639 --> 00:22:19.161]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.

[00:24:27.244 --> 00:24:33.765]  I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car.
[00:24:33.765 --> 00:24:37.366]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:24:37.366 --> 00:24:42.427]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24:42.427 --> 00:24:43.328]  Where to start?
[00:24:43.328 --> 00:24:47.129]  Let me just give you some of the headlines that are coming up.
[00:24:47.129 --> 00:24:51.790]  White House vows CIA will not stage fake vaccine programs.
[00:24:54.246 --> 00:25:02.576]  Former Prime Minister of Malaysia accuses CIA of covering up MH370 disappearance.
[00:25:02.576 --> 00:25:04.198]  That's some of the news on that front.
[00:25:04.198 --> 00:25:09.464]  Fed's latest land grab designates contested New Mexico area a national monument.
[00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:11.307]  We're going to be getting into that report.
[00:25:14.411 --> 00:25:18.853]  We're going to be breaking down this extremely important article.
[00:25:18.853 --> 00:25:21.073]  It's the top story up on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:21.073 --> 00:25:26.756]  In fact, I'm going to have this story red-linked because it's so important.
[00:25:26.756 --> 00:25:29.517]  The plan to kill the Internet uncovered.
[00:25:29.517 --> 00:25:31.437]  Breaking.
[00:25:31.437 --> 00:25:38.960]  Ten ways the freedom of the World Wide Web is being dismantled.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.602]  Or ten ways the Internet is being dismantled piece by piece.
[00:25:45.071 --> 00:25:46.452]  Is what I would say.
[00:25:46.452 --> 00:25:49.835]  Paul Watson and I both wrote this article together.
[00:25:49.835 --> 00:25:52.537]  And it breaks down the 10 ways they're killing it.
[00:25:52.537 --> 00:25:58.501]  We're going to be going over that starting at the beginning of the next segment.
[00:25:58.501 --> 00:26:04.005]  And this subject's going to be the main focus of the next issue of the magazine.
[00:26:04.005 --> 00:26:07.128]  And again, you can say, well, I don't care if the Internet's free.
[00:26:07.128 --> 00:26:09.089]  I don't care if they don't censor.
[00:26:09.089 --> 00:26:10.130]  It's going to be economic.
[00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.653]  They first have to censor political speech.
[00:26:14.918 --> 00:26:17.280]  And then they can censor everything else, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.241]  That's how it works.
[00:26:18.241 --> 00:26:29.631]  They want to economically be able to keep you from having your businesses, your products online, or charge you a prohibitive rate for access to it via the telecoms.
[00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:31.413]  You're already paying for it with your connection.
[00:26:31.413 --> 00:26:34.235]  You're already paying for the bandwidth of Netflix and everything else.
[00:26:34.235 --> 00:26:41.842]  The attempt to charge Netflix and the end consumer to get to Netflix or to get to InfoWars.com or DrudgeReport.com
[00:26:42.942 --> 00:26:43.803]  And it's not just that.
[00:26:43.803 --> 00:26:47.045]  The head of the FCC came out.
[00:26:47.045 --> 00:26:47.966]  See, I'm already covering this.
[00:26:47.966 --> 00:26:49.146]  I'll cover it in the next segment.
[00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:58.993]  Last week and said, look, they want to bring in Fairness Doctrine, federal elections commissions, the same folks that have had Dinesh D'Souza arrested.
[00:26:58.993 --> 00:26:59.834]  He's now pled guilty.
[00:26:59.834 --> 00:27:07.799]  I guess because they'll go light on him if he just gets probation for getting his friends to donate money, something Obama does, times a billion, literally.
[00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:10.121]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:27:11.826 --> 00:27:19.108]  Obama's gotten billions and billions and billions and billions and billions, most of it seedy, corrupt donations, illegal donations.
[00:27:19.108 --> 00:27:23.229]  And Dinesh D'Souza, what was it, like $30,000 he got his friends to give?
[00:27:23.229 --> 00:27:25.450]  Bundling?
[00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.790]  Now they're saying, well, it's not $30,000, it's $15,000.
[00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.891]  To a U.S.
[00:27:30.891 --> 00:27:35.912]  Senate campaign of his friend.
[00:27:35.912 --> 00:27:37.353]  I mean, this is just wild.
[00:27:38.342 --> 00:27:42.306]  The intimidation of political giving that isn't the Democrats.
[00:27:42.306 --> 00:27:45.889]  If people were persecuting the Democrats like this, I'd come out against it.
[00:27:45.889 --> 00:27:48.191]  And this is serious.
[00:27:48.191 --> 00:27:50.613]  You shouldn't go after the pro-lifers or everybody else.
[00:27:50.613 --> 00:27:55.978]  Obama supporter brags about illegal foreign donations on President's own website.
[00:27:55.978 --> 00:27:56.719]  Remember that article?
[00:27:57.888 --> 00:27:59.710]  Print me that, please.
[00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:11.922]  It's so incredible how open they are with the foreign donations, all of it, and the hypocrisy of it, the corruption of it, is mind-boggling.
[00:28:11.922 --> 00:28:13.403]  So we're going to get into that report.
[00:28:13.403 --> 00:28:14.805]  We've got a new report.
[00:28:14.805 --> 00:28:19.970]  Wisconsin police reassure residents they won't be shot at from military truck.
[00:28:21.189 --> 00:28:29.271]  But then we have in Indiana, the police getting the same giant armored vehicles from Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:28:29.271 --> 00:28:31.812]  The Globalist has produced more and said, oh, it's surplus.
[00:28:31.812 --> 00:28:32.612]  Here's a brand new one.
[00:28:32.612 --> 00:28:34.232]  By the way, they're building more.
[00:28:34.232 --> 00:28:36.113]  Oh, yeah, that's surplus too.
[00:28:36.113 --> 00:28:40.054]  No, they are arming and training the local police.
[00:28:40.054 --> 00:28:41.554]  And in their own words, we'll play the clip again.
[00:28:43.317 --> 00:28:44.598]  It's for veterans.
[00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:45.799]  They're the enemy.
[00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:47.841]  We need this for the veterans.
[00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:50.623]  What did Big Sis say six years ago in those internal documents?
[00:28:50.623 --> 00:28:53.506]  And then she doubled down and defended it to the Associated Press.
[00:28:53.506 --> 00:29:00.132]  Returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, pro-lifers, Ron Paul supporters, Chuck Baldwin supporters.
[00:29:01.937 --> 00:29:04.239]  You know, I wasn't in that first MIAC report.
[00:29:04.239 --> 00:29:08.702]  Aaron Russo, posthumously, he'd been dead for a couple years when that came out.
[00:29:08.702 --> 00:29:13.826]  They said his movie, America, Freedom to Fascism, just exposes the fraud of the IRS.
[00:29:13.826 --> 00:29:16.748]  Why, that's terrorism!
[00:29:16.748 --> 00:29:22.573]  Now, on many of the other reports, I'm very honored by that, but I want to be on the list and the top of all the lists.
[00:29:22.573 --> 00:29:25.555]  Like John Hancock, you know, signed his signature so big.
[00:29:25.555 --> 00:29:26.836]  It was a death warrant to do it.
[00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:32.639]  If they didn't succeed, your family, your children, your treasure, your name.
[00:29:32.639 --> 00:29:37.783]  So he signed it bigger than everybody else's John Hancock.
[00:29:37.783 --> 00:29:42.166]  And I am just completely insulted that I was not in that original report.
[00:29:42.166 --> 00:29:45.728]  But now, of course, now I'm in all the big new ones and I appreciate that.
[00:29:45.728 --> 00:29:48.110]  In the White House reports, you name it, thank you.
[00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.411]  That's a badge of honor.
[00:29:49.411 --> 00:29:51.552]  That's like the Congressional Medal of Honor for me.
[00:29:51.552 --> 00:29:54.795]  To have enemy traitors like you demonizing me.
[00:29:54.795 --> 00:29:56.436]  Benedict Arnold, scum.
[00:29:56.436 --> 00:29:57.717]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:29:59.793 --> 00:30:02.834]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:04.995]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:30:04.995 --> 00:30:11.178]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:30:11.178 --> 00:30:16.261]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:30:16.261 --> 00:30:21.143]  The new InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:30:21.143 --> 00:30:25.645]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:30:25.945 --> 00:30:34.547]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:30:34.547 --> 00:30:36.708]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:30:36.708 --> 00:30:47.890]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:55.292]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.

[00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:02.917]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:31:02.917 --> 00:31:08.060]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:16.165]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:20.688]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:31:20.688 --> 00:31:24.510]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:30.594]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:31:30.594 --> 00:31:33.776]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:31:33.776 --> 00:31:39.160]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:47.305]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:47.525]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:31:54.830 --> 00:32:06.097]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:32:06.097 --> 00:32:09.398]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:32:09.398 --> 00:32:11.179]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:17.363]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:32:17.543 --> 00:32:23.586]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security on sticking their hands down on the pants on the streets?
[00:32:23.586 --> 00:32:27.548]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:32:27.548 --> 00:32:30.489]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:32:30.489 --> 00:32:38.893]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:32:38.893 --> 00:32:40.994]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:32:40.994 --> 00:32:42.055]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:32:42.395 --> 00:32:51.358]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:32:51.358 --> 00:32:54.019]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:32:54.019 --> 00:32:58.300]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[00:33:03.627 --> 00:33:05.488]  We are on the march.
[00:33:05.488 --> 00:33:08.651]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:08.651 --> 00:33:15.516]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.516 --> 00:33:20.279]  Web freedom, ladies and gentlemen, is being butchered.
[00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:27.004]  And they're using the same cocktail of programs from Communist China to France to the United States to get the job done.
[00:33:28.615 --> 00:33:36.802]  The plan to kill internet freedom uncovered 10 ways the freedom of the world wide web is being butchered.
[00:33:36.802 --> 00:33:41.647]  10 ways the freedom of the web is being butchered world wide.
[00:33:41.647 --> 00:33:43.829]  Completely dismantled.
[00:33:43.829 --> 00:33:52.837]  And the story is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and you can also go to InfoWars.com and see
[00:33:54.727 --> 00:33:56.408]  The new look of the website.
[00:33:56.408 --> 00:34:02.470]  We're leaving it basically the way it looked before, just with a new font and new coding so that it works better.
[00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:08.892]  And then we're going to phase it in in about another month with a more responsive, wider page.
[00:34:08.892 --> 00:34:12.714]  And then just incrementally over the next six months, we're going to transform the site.
[00:34:13.294 --> 00:34:15.475]  We've got a good company to do that.
[00:34:15.475 --> 00:34:19.777]  So that's what we're doing right now with InfoWars.com.
[00:34:19.777 --> 00:34:22.038]  You can see how the new pages load.
[00:34:22.038 --> 00:34:29.261]  We're getting pretty much unanimous reviews that people like the way the site looks.
[00:34:29.261 --> 00:34:35.544]  And the top half of the front page of InfoWars.com looks the same.
[00:34:35.544 --> 00:34:38.705]  The article pages have a new font, a new layout, and a new look.
[00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:53.364]  The nav bar at the top is different, but what's really important is the bottom half of InfoWars is a more responsive system based on breaking news and is a lot easier to navigate.
[00:34:54.565 --> 00:35:15.361]  So be sure and check out the newinfoawards.com and then again we're going to try out some other designs with prisonplanet.com but we tried a couple other designs people didn't like we launched this last night we're getting up to say 95% positive reviews so I think we're going to stick with this and then as I said phase it into something that looks more like the London Guardian meets
[00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.971]  Wired Magazine or something over the next six months.
[00:35:20.971 --> 00:35:22.452]  It won't look the same in six months.
[00:35:22.452 --> 00:35:28.973]  It's just that people cannot stand a whole new look even if it's clean.
[00:35:28.973 --> 00:35:33.535]  We can't damage the fact that this site has over a million people that visit it every day.
[00:35:33.535 --> 00:35:36.976]  It's one of the largest alternative media sites in the world.
[00:35:37.978 --> 00:35:40.721]  So it's got an old eight-year design that's been great.
[00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:43.503]  It was great eight years ago when Kurt Nemo designed it.
[00:35:43.503 --> 00:35:47.888]  It's just been on a date for a few years and so Kurt's really worked with everybody to update it.
[00:35:47.888 --> 00:35:50.690]  We appreciate his fine work and the whole team.
[00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:54.914]  Buckley Hammond, Anthony Gucciardi,
[00:35:57.728 --> 00:36:02.050]  Molly Rogers and so many others, the whole crew here.
[00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.670]  Tim Fouchier, everybody's just done a great job.
[00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.692]  There's no way to thank everybody that worked on getting it updated.
[00:36:06.692 --> 00:36:08.853]  But again, InfoWars.com.
[00:36:08.853 --> 00:36:10.493]  Then, of course, you have the Backup Mirror site.
[00:36:10.493 --> 00:36:17.116]  It's not really a mirror, but it has most of the same news, but a lot of news that doesn't ever get to InfoWars for some reason ends up on Prison Planet.
[00:36:17.116 --> 00:36:21.998]  So you need to visit both sites, obviously, and we appreciate you clicking on the sponsors as well to support the broadcast.
[00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:30.117]  And finally, I was going to do it this week again, but then I've been messing with a whole bunch of other stuff we're rolling out.
[00:36:30.117 --> 00:36:34.882]  I tend to bite off more than I can chew, but I'm learning to eat the elephant one bite at a time.
[00:36:34.882 --> 00:36:36.503]  We're getting close to launching in the new studio.
[00:36:37.472 --> 00:36:43.057]  And if it's not later in the week, it'll be next week that I'll start hosting the news in the new studio.
[00:36:43.057 --> 00:36:53.868]  It's just that, again, we've been working mainly on the satellite uplinks and, you know, the format of the TV show and a bunch of other things we've been doing and just keeping all the other plates in the air, all the other balls in the air.
[00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:58.613]  It's like a cartoon where the character has like a hundred plates in each hand, trying to balance it, but we're getting there.
[00:36:59.514 --> 00:37:00.375]  We're getting there.
[00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:08.560]  Part of our strength is we're totally independent and don't have consultants really, and I kind of built this on my own just from the ground up.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:18.967]  So that's what made it resilient, successful, and avant-garde in many respects, but also sloth-like and quirky in other ways.
[00:37:18.967 --> 00:37:20.467]  We move at light speed in some ways.
[00:37:21.485 --> 00:37:24.487]  Kind of rattle-trapping others, but it's getting better and better.
[00:37:24.487 --> 00:37:30.412]  And we've just got a superlative team overall that are staying on mission and focus and doing a better and better job.
[00:37:30.412 --> 00:37:35.996]  I think everybody can hear that with the radio show, see that with the Simulcast with TV, and so much more.
[00:37:35.996 --> 00:37:42.461]  And you the listeners taking action out there, we should not take the fact that this show is on the air for granted.
[00:37:42.461 --> 00:37:47.185]  We should not take other libertarian, freedom-based sites for granted.
[00:37:47.185 --> 00:37:49.447]  Because, just because we're starting to win the InfoWar,
[00:37:51.462 --> 00:37:58.145]  Does not mean that the globalists aren't going to strike back and aren't striking back.
[00:37:58.145 --> 00:38:06.530]  Starting all these wars worldwide, economic crises, health crises that they can either exacerbate or stage.
[00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.352]  It's a critical juncture and you see the world speeding up, the quickening, the
[00:38:13.786 --> 00:38:14.386]  We're good to go.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:41.002]  of major trends and futurist paradigms and projecting the lines forward.
[00:38:41.002 --> 00:38:42.102]  People think of that as work.
[00:38:42.102 --> 00:38:43.382]  Hey, let's just go party.
[00:38:43.382 --> 00:38:44.702]  Let's just go have fun.
[00:38:44.702 --> 00:38:48.623]  Well, you need balance in life.
[00:38:48.623 --> 00:38:58.546]  And if you don't spend any time learning about the mysteries of the universe, you're going to be a very dull, unhappy, narcissistic person who only cares about vanity.
[00:38:58.546 --> 00:39:00.246]  And vanity will fade.
[00:39:01.624 --> 00:39:03.886]  Or the looks that you're vain about.
[00:39:03.886 --> 00:39:08.730]  Or the baubles, the toys, will fade.
[00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:15.295]  And will not deliver to you, in my experience, but historically this has been well documented.
[00:39:15.295 --> 00:39:16.957]  This is a lot of common sense I'm putting out here.
[00:39:16.957 --> 00:39:19.198]  I'm not reinventing the wheel.
[00:39:19.198 --> 00:39:21.660]  Vanity will destroy you.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.622]  Worldliness will destroy you.
[00:39:23.622 --> 00:39:29.387]  Baubles, goods, the worship of things in the final equation,
[00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:34.095]  Will not fulfill you.
[00:39:34.095 --> 00:39:42.388]  But at the same time, if the globalists can keep you poor, never attaining goods, you will never know that they really don't matter in the final equation.
[00:39:42.388 --> 00:39:46.174]  Once you have good shelter, good transportation, and basic health care.
[00:39:48.112 --> 00:39:56.856]  Then you go, oh wow, I want to go on and help other people, or I want to go on and create art, I want to go on and explore, I want to trailblaze, I want to invent.
[00:39:56.856 --> 00:39:58.337]  That's the real human spirit.
[00:39:58.337 --> 00:40:06.521]  So they try to keep you suppressed and not getting those basic things you need so that you will stay basically trapped in their paradigm.
[00:40:06.521 --> 00:40:10.843]  So I'm not saying that material things don't matter.
[00:40:10.843 --> 00:40:13.525]  If you didn't have material things, they're going to matter.
[00:40:13.525 --> 00:40:15.746]  If you can't get the money to pay for your children's
[00:40:16.846 --> 00:40:18.467]  Root canal, it's going to be a big deal.
[00:40:18.467 --> 00:40:34.217]  If you can't get money to put fuel in your tank to get to work, it hurts bad when you're speeding because you're late 10 miles over the speed limit and the cop pulls you over and writes you that $200 ticket that you don't have.
[00:40:34.217 --> 00:40:39.041]  So everything in this world is balance and obviously a paradox, but I'm digressing.
[00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:43.664]  I want to get into the attack on the internet first, then these other reports.
[00:40:44.915 --> 00:40:55.640]  Coming up in the third hour, it's so crazy, the audio is so crazy, that I'm going to air it just to illustrate how out of control Satanists are.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:06.265]  Dan Bodondi, last week, was up there at that Black Mass in Connecticut.
[00:41:06.265 --> 00:41:09.447]  That was at the major college there that got so much attention.
[00:41:09.447 --> 00:41:11.188]  You guys brought that into my stack, where is that?
[00:41:14.266 --> 00:41:20.190]  No, no, I asked for you to print me some more on the Black Mass at the start of the show, and I saw you doing it.
[00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.332]  I just wanted the details of that.
[00:41:22.332 --> 00:41:23.533]  Thank you.
[00:41:23.533 --> 00:41:28.837]  But the point is, is that Dambadandi mailed us the footage.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:40.745]  I guess he had trouble uploading it or whatever, but the point is, is that we got the footage Friday, we saw it yesterday, and we're gonna premiere some of it here, because none of this has been on the news.
[00:41:40.745 --> 00:41:42.926]  Little short sound bites have been on the news.
[00:41:42.926 --> 00:41:45.107]  We have like an hour of this.
[00:41:45.107 --> 00:41:49.669]  We have ten minutes of it boiled down that is sensational.
[00:41:49.669 --> 00:41:52.890]  Now five minutes of it, I'll get posted to InfoWars.com.
[00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:56.392]  It was on the nightly news last night.
[00:41:56.392 --> 00:41:56.612]  But,
[00:41:58.769 --> 00:42:00.310]  We have 10 minutes that hasn't been seen.
[00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.271]  I'm going to premiere coming up in the third hour.
[00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:08.934]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free video feeds if you want to see it or you can listen to it.
[00:42:08.934 --> 00:42:12.876]  But the Satanists are running around saying, we will kill you Christians.
[00:42:12.876 --> 00:42:14.117]  There will be blood everywhere.
[00:42:14.117 --> 00:42:15.778]  We want your blood.
[00:42:15.778 --> 00:42:22.281]  And I mean, these Satanists, their eyes, I think it's a trick of the lights, but they're actually glowing in the dark.
[00:42:22.281 --> 00:42:24.502]  I mean, it's like something out of a movie, folks.
[00:42:24.502 --> 00:42:25.983]  These are like real Satanists.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:30.581]  Yeah, they say they own our children, just like MSNBC.
[00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:32.721]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[00:42:32.721 --> 00:42:37.422]  And the Christians are out there.
[00:42:37.422 --> 00:42:42.383]  And some of them are as hokey as the Satanists are crazy.
[00:42:42.383 --> 00:42:49.505]  And some of these Satanists doing this at Harvard, at the church, sanctioned by the university, they're prominent Satanists.
[00:42:49.505 --> 00:42:54.106]  They're the ones that want to get the public plaques of Baphomet with the children lovingly sitting in his lap.
[00:42:56.584 --> 00:43:02.088]  And I just want to illustrate the type of people this culture is creating.
[00:43:02.088 --> 00:43:05.911]  But, it was not cancelled because of protest.
[00:43:05.911 --> 00:43:24.065]  Harvard had agreed that they could, quote, recreate the Black Mass, but when the Satanists showed up, they were so out of control, desecrating the church and doing stuff in it, reportedly, this is what Bonandi has reported and was there, and that's some of it on tape, that that's when the school said, look, you gotta get out of here.
[00:43:24.963 --> 00:43:29.985]  Because these people were running around howling and were completely out of control.
[00:43:29.985 --> 00:43:35.167]  And I gotta be honest with you, I had a real instinct to want to punch these people in the nose.
[00:43:35.167 --> 00:43:38.788]  People against goodness and normalcy.
[00:43:38.788 --> 00:43:40.929]  P-A-G-A-N.
[00:43:40.929 --> 00:43:42.450]  Pagan.
[00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:43.130]  Ah!
[00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:51.653]  There are two who have not yet sipped the nectar of shaitan!
[00:43:51.653 --> 00:43:53.634]  Now see folks, that's a pagan party right there.
[00:43:55.233 --> 00:43:55.974]  Some pills.
[00:44:08.726 --> 00:44:16.149]  By the way, in high school growing up, I actually got taken, I said this on air, I got taken to a couple of just regular pagan parties.
[00:44:16.149 --> 00:44:19.391]  And then one time I didn't know where I was going in college and they took me to one.
[00:44:19.391 --> 00:44:21.972]  Because those are super widespread.
[00:44:21.972 --> 00:44:26.094]  And that's just a bunch of crazy people wanting to party.
[00:44:26.094 --> 00:44:29.275]  Usually led by Satanists at the top that want to manipulate and control people.
[00:44:29.275 --> 00:44:30.276]  It is a cult and it's bad.
[00:44:31.243 --> 00:44:34.766]  But the Satanists are an entirely different ball of wax.
[00:44:34.766 --> 00:44:40.750]  Then you've got the Luciferians, and of course you can argue the pagans are really worshipping Satan, which they are.
[00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:46.254]  The horned God, you know, the Druids and people get mad and say that's not who our God is.
[00:44:46.254 --> 00:44:48.036]  We don't sacrifice people.
[00:44:48.036 --> 00:44:49.297]  Look, that's pure bull.
[00:44:49.297 --> 00:44:51.598]  Go take an anthropology course.
[00:44:51.598 --> 00:44:53.880]  Stop saying you don't sacrifice kids.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.142]  Then you're not following a Druidic right.
[00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:01.952]  Then you're not following a Celtic system.
[00:45:01.952 --> 00:45:02.772]  Okay?
[00:45:02.772 --> 00:45:05.933]  You're not following a Babylonian system.
[00:45:05.933 --> 00:45:10.955]  Worldwide, every culture sacrifices children on fire altars.
[00:45:10.955 --> 00:45:11.315]  Okay?
[00:45:11.315 --> 00:45:12.535]  Every culture.
[00:45:12.535 --> 00:45:14.536]  The Aztecs did it.
[00:45:14.536 --> 00:45:16.036]  Everybody did it.
[00:45:16.036 --> 00:45:19.758]  The Aztecs mainly cut their hearts out, but they also drowned them and burned them.
[00:45:19.758 --> 00:45:20.718]  Every culture did it.
[00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:22.839]  Even the ancient Chinese had some of it going on.
[00:45:22.839 --> 00:45:24.899]  The Chinese were the first to stop it.
[00:45:24.899 --> 00:45:26.080]  I've got to give them credit, 5,000 years ago.
[00:45:30.191 --> 00:45:35.675]  So let's just act, because I always love the Wiccans, send me emails and stuff and they get real mad.
[00:45:35.675 --> 00:45:39.739]  And they say, Alex, what's saying we're Satanist and we, you know, that we sacrifice kids?
[00:45:39.739 --> 00:45:43.201]  Well, you're not really a Wiccan then.
[00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:51.088]  You're a modern kind of bleached out fake one who just says that they, you know, follow Mother Earth stuff and all this stuff.
[00:45:51.088 --> 00:45:52.349]  Fine, whatever.
[00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:54.310]  I'm not even saying you're a bad person.
[00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:55.611]  Let's just be honest about it.
[00:45:55.611 --> 00:45:56.472]  I'm not judging you.
[00:45:57.628 --> 00:46:03.809]  I'm just telling you at the bottom of the rat hole is the murder of children and I don't like it.
[00:46:03.809 --> 00:46:05.529]  The exploitation of children.
[00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:13.231]  So that's coming up in the third hour.
[00:46:13.231 --> 00:46:16.291]  I'll play that ten minute report and give commentary on it.
[00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:18.632]  We will premiere that here.
[00:46:18.632 --> 00:46:23.273]  So we should tweet out that we're going to show the black mass in fights.
[00:46:23.273 --> 00:46:24.513]  I don't know how you describe it.
[00:46:24.513 --> 00:46:25.373]  I mean I came up with words.
[00:46:28.144 --> 00:46:33.208]  Satanists battle Christians in the streets of Connecticut?
[00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:35.129]  Satanists call for blood of Christians?
[00:46:35.129 --> 00:46:44.536]  I mean, these people are literally foaming at the mouth in a demonic rage.
[00:46:44.536 --> 00:46:45.497]  And I'm just saying.
[00:46:45.497 --> 00:46:47.639]  I'm just saying.
[00:46:47.639 --> 00:46:49.100]  I'm just saying.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.681]  I'm not trying to act tough, folks.
[00:46:50.681 --> 00:46:51.362]  I'm not tough.
[00:46:51.362 --> 00:46:55.525]  I've had a broken leg in a fight, been in the hospital, I've had my butt kicked plenty of times.
[00:46:58.064 --> 00:47:01.965]  But if these Satanists got in my face for saying stuff, I'm telling you, I could not help it.
[00:47:01.965 --> 00:47:04.625]  I would definitely punch them in the nose.
[00:47:04.625 --> 00:47:07.126]  Then they'd be like, look at the Christian being aggressive.
[00:47:07.126 --> 00:47:10.846]  You're calling for people's blood and saying your children belong to us.
[00:47:10.846 --> 00:47:16.147]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:47:16.147 --> 00:47:23.929]  No, I'm not saying we should burn them at the stake or anything.
[00:47:23.929 --> 00:47:24.749]  I don't know, man.
[00:47:24.749 --> 00:47:25.729]  It's just out of control.
[00:47:27.332 --> 00:47:33.155]  Tie some waterlogged logs to them, throw them in the water, see if they sink.
[00:47:33.155 --> 00:47:34.956]  If they sink, it means they're innocent, but they die.
[00:47:34.956 --> 00:47:36.237]  If they float, they're a witch.
[00:47:36.237 --> 00:47:36.817]  A witch!
[00:47:36.817 --> 00:47:37.538]  A witch!
[00:47:37.538 --> 00:47:38.498]  I'm joking, folks.
[00:47:38.498 --> 00:47:39.619]  I'm not saying do that.
[00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:42.360]  I'm quoting Monty Python.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.623]  The point is, we don't just air stuff because it's entertaining, but this is sensational.
[00:47:46.623 --> 00:47:52.166]  So, we're going to play that coming up in the third hour and tie it into Bohemian Grove and Luciferianism.
[00:47:52.166 --> 00:47:54.347]  What is Luciferianism versus Satanism?
[00:47:56.963 --> 00:48:00.305]  Versus pagan parties.
[00:48:00.305 --> 00:48:02.446]  Which are just ubiquitous.
[00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.627]  Ubiquitous.
[00:48:03.627 --> 00:48:13.153]  They've had articles in Texas Monthly, you know, with years ago with Democratic officials that go out and literally a bunch of women go out and howl at the moon and, you know, do witchcraft.
[00:48:13.153 --> 00:48:16.755]  I mean, it's just that mainstream, folks.
[00:48:16.755 --> 00:48:18.736]  So, it's all going to get broken down today.
[00:48:18.736 --> 00:48:24.620]  We're going to go to break and I promise I'm going to come back and get into how they're going to kill the internet and how we can stop it.
[00:48:25.532 --> 00:48:43.264]  The plan to kill the internet uncovered, it's red linked up at Infowars.com and I am begging you to get this out to friends and family and everybody else because I gotta be honest, no one even seems to know how it's being done.
[00:48:43.264 --> 00:48:45.625]  People all debate one little part or the other part.
[00:48:45.625 --> 00:48:51.469]  We're not just looking at the Hydra heads, we're looking at the necks and the body and the legs and the belly and the tail.
[00:48:54.628 --> 00:48:58.271]  Of what's doing this and what the end game goal is.
[00:48:58.271 --> 00:49:01.314]  And it's an article Paul Watson and I put together last night and this morning.
[00:49:01.314 --> 00:49:03.116]  Worked on it last night and this morning.
[00:49:03.116 --> 00:49:06.298]  And we're going to be getting to that when we come back from break.
[00:49:06.298 --> 00:49:15.266]  Briefly, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot tell you enough how powerful super male vitality is.
[00:49:15.266 --> 00:49:17.208]  And it works on men and women.
[00:49:17.208 --> 00:49:18.209]  We do have a female version.
[00:49:18.209 --> 00:49:21.392]  That's actually a totally new formula coming out that's been tested on
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:28.044]  Well, Steiner's wife took it and some other guy's wife took it and didn't even tell him to say it.
[00:49:28.044 --> 00:49:31.347]  Didn't give him a placebo, said, hey, what do you think of this?
[00:49:31.347 --> 00:49:33.609]  And it just really gave him a lot of vitality.
[00:49:33.609 --> 00:49:36.011]  Energy, libido, workout, you name it.
[00:49:36.011 --> 00:49:38.113]  This is the most concentrated stuff out there.
[00:49:38.113 --> 00:49:40.375]  That, by the way, comes out next week.
[00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:42.857]  Female, super feminine vitality.
[00:49:44.557 --> 00:49:49.221]  A true fusion of herbs concentrated for female fusion.
[00:49:49.221 --> 00:49:50.682]  That is coming out next week.
[00:49:50.682 --> 00:49:54.485]  In fact, it gets delivered from the laboratory tomorrow.
[00:49:54.485 --> 00:49:59.289]  But we will sell no wine until it's time to quote the late great Orson Welles.
[00:49:59.289 --> 00:50:04.193]  Super Male Vitality is available right now with the 8 concentrated herbs.
[00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:09.893]  And fruit extracts, totally organic, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:50:09.893 --> 00:50:11.594]  So you really can't miss.
[00:50:11.594 --> 00:50:13.815]  Just order it, know your support in the broadcast.
[00:50:13.815 --> 00:50:23.761]  We have a special right now, the Super Mel Vitality with a survival shield, nascent iodine, where you save, I don't know, what is that, like 40% total off the regular cost?
[00:50:23.761 --> 00:50:26.163]  I mean, this is very expensive to produce.
[00:50:26.163 --> 00:50:29.845]  Leading competitors are twice this price and are not even organic from our research.

[00:51:34.011 --> 00:51:40.576]  Criminals know that your wooden door frames are weak and your alarm system can't keep them out.
[00:51:40.576 --> 00:51:43.919]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel.
[00:51:43.919 --> 00:51:47.342]  Standard locks, deadbolts, and alarm systems can't prevent forced entry.
[00:51:47.342 --> 00:51:49.964]  Harden your door and door jam with the Door Sentinel.

[00:51:58.692 --> 00:52:02.713]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:52:02.713 --> 00:52:07.035]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:52:07.035 --> 00:52:10.656]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:52:10.656 --> 00:52:13.677]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:52:13.677 --> 00:52:21.159]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:24.800]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.463]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:52:29.463 --> 00:52:35.367]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:52:35.367 --> 00:52:39.289]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:42.011]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:52:42.011 --> 00:52:43.512]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:52:43.512 --> 00:52:44.853]  It's time to take action.
[00:52:44.853 --> 00:52:46.674]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:52:57.322 --> 00:52:59.684]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:52:59.684 --> 00:53:03.347]  Why do police go undercover and why do countries send out spies?
[00:53:03.347 --> 00:53:03.908]  Simple.
[00:53:03.908 --> 00:53:08.832]  If you can guess from intelligence what the other guy is doing, you have the battle won before it starts.
[00:53:08.832 --> 00:53:11.575]  Let's see what intelligence we have about your food situation.
[00:53:11.775 --> 00:53:13.676]  We're having the worst disasters ever.
[00:53:13.676 --> 00:53:16.317]  Storms, earthquakes, floods, and terrible drought.
[00:53:16.317 --> 00:53:20.558]  Half our population needs food stamps and other subsidies to afford their food now.
[00:53:20.558 --> 00:53:24.220]  Prices have just hit their all-time high, with more terrible costs coming.
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:27.701]  Your food, and now your water, are being sold to other starving countries.
[00:53:28.181 --> 00:53:32.904]  Still, one-third of our corn goes to expensive gas instead of feeding livestock and people.
[00:53:32.904 --> 00:53:36.747]  What few dollars you have, China expects to devalue to uselessness.
[00:53:36.747 --> 00:53:44.992]  If it's possible to get the most of the best food and freeze the availability and cost before it disappears and is unavailable, you don't dare miss the opportunity.
[00:53:44.992 --> 00:53:46.633]  Go to MyFarmInABox.com or call 855-918-3663.
[00:53:46.633 --> 00:53:47.714]  That's MyFarmInABox.com or 855-918-3663.
[00:54:12.077 --> 00:54:21.442]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to a hundred and three.
[00:54:21.442 --> 00:54:23.083]  A hundred and three.
[00:54:23.083 --> 00:54:26.925]  A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid.
[00:54:26.925 --> 00:54:28.366]  So.
[00:54:28.366 --> 00:54:29.387]  So.
[00:54:29.387 --> 00:54:32.188]  Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[00:54:32.188 --> 00:54:33.529]  Grave Digger.
[00:54:33.529 --> 00:54:34.790]  Grave Digger.
[00:54:36.121 --> 00:54:38.322]  Will you dig my grave?
[00:54:38.322 --> 00:54:40.824]  Will you dig it shallow?
[00:54:40.824 --> 00:54:42.505]  So I can feel the rain.
[00:54:42.505 --> 00:54:46.487]  So I can feel the rain.
[00:54:46.487 --> 00:54:54.412]  Must be some old Texas saying, which Willie Nelson comes from the same area as my dad.
[00:54:54.412 --> 00:55:05.058]  But that's an old saying, like, I just want to be married with no box close to the surface so I can feel the rain and
[00:55:06.624 --> 00:55:13.090]  Bury me under an apple tree so I may touch your lips or taste your lips again.
[00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:13.930]  That's a great idea.
[00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:18.675]  I'd like to be buried about three feet in the ground under an apple orchard.
[00:55:18.675 --> 00:55:23.259]  Plant a bunch of apple trees on top of me.
[00:55:23.259 --> 00:55:26.421]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's get into how they plan to kill the Internet.
[00:55:26.421 --> 00:55:27.703]  The plan to kill the Internet?
[00:55:27.703 --> 00:55:28.603]  Uncovered.
[00:55:28.603 --> 00:55:32.547]  Ten ways the freedom of the World Wide Web is being dismantled.
[00:55:34.537 --> 00:55:55.394]  The Internet has emerged as the most empowering tool of individual freedom since the Gutenberg Press, affording billions of people worldwide not only the tool of instant communication, but access to the wealth of liberating information, freedom from the chains of received consensus, and the opportunity to become their own media platform, as well as commerce.
[00:55:56.707 --> 00:55:59.029]  And ideas, it's just across the board.
[00:55:59.029 --> 00:56:11.721]  This represents an ever-increasing threat to the status quo of the elite, which is why the establishment is working feverishly to dismantle the freedom granted by the World Wide Web in its current form.
[00:56:11.721 --> 00:56:16.465]  And we go through the death of net neutrality worldwide that's openly being announced.
[00:56:16.465 --> 00:56:21.389]  Number two, intelligence agencies are manipulating Internet with deliberate disinformation.
[00:56:22.441 --> 00:56:26.606]  And governments are paying trolls to sway public opinion.
[00:56:26.606 --> 00:56:29.869]  Media news websites are killing comment sections.
[00:56:29.869 --> 00:56:34.795]  The Obama administration's cognitive infiltration of the internet with Cass Sunstein to create disinfo.
[00:56:34.795 --> 00:56:37.158]  False flag cyber security attacks.
[00:56:37.158 --> 00:56:42.664]  FBI, CIA releasing worms on purpose to then bring the web down as a pretext for increased web regulation.
[00:56:43.939 --> 00:56:54.427]  Number seven, Fairness Doctrine for the Internet is being openly announced, and the head of the FCC has said it's a plan to target libertarian media, like Matt Drudge.
[00:56:54.427 --> 00:57:05.395]  Homeland Security's internet kill switch, number eight, which they openly announced they're putting the hubs in to do it, just like Thailand just killed the internet, basically, for news, under martial law.
[00:57:05.395 --> 00:57:10.799]  Number nine, new taxes and regulations set to stop all communications and sales on the web and to surveil it.
[00:57:11.619 --> 00:57:15.661]  Web IDs, SOPA and CISPA, and the FBI's Internet backdoor.
[00:57:15.661 --> 00:57:18.242]  We should probably add a few bonuses at the end.
[00:57:18.242 --> 00:57:21.904]  The Web ID they're pushing, and a lot of other stuff.
[00:57:21.904 --> 00:57:26.046]  But that's the 10 big ways they're doing it.
[00:57:26.046 --> 00:57:27.487]  And actually, I talked about this with Paul.
[00:57:27.487 --> 00:57:28.828]  He did a transcript of some of what I said.
[00:57:28.828 --> 00:57:35.151]  We need to add Internet 2, where they create the Fast Lane Internets, to quote Bush.
[00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:37.052]  Internets.
[00:57:37.052 --> 00:57:37.752]  We need to add
[00:57:39.795 --> 00:57:45.878]  The 10, but then say, and incidentally, the last two are even more important.
[00:57:45.878 --> 00:57:47.359]  Two bonus ones.
[00:57:47.359 --> 00:57:48.239]  I'm going to call Watson.
[00:57:48.239 --> 00:57:49.020]  I want to get at it.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:53.542]  The internet fast lanes is net neutrality, but it's another way of doing it.
[00:57:53.542 --> 00:57:57.284]  Where they build a quote, new internet, and then attack the old internet.
[00:57:57.284 --> 00:58:06.228]  That's the key to this whole article is that they've created a new internet that's quote, safe, but you don't have any rights on it because they're not attacking it.
[00:58:06.228 --> 00:58:07.809]  And then they just phase out the old one.
[00:58:09.389 --> 00:58:10.310]  And then Internet ID.
[00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:20.997]  And I know that's in there, but we need to really state the key to it, as people understand, is kill the old Internet with all this weight, collapse it like they collapse societies, and then bring in their solution.
[00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:25.600]  Just like they've collapsed Libya with Al-Qaeda in the last four years, now they're going to send in U.S.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:31.704]  troops to take control of it, and then have some fake skirmishes with the Al-Qaeda groups they're openly funding.
[00:58:31.704 --> 00:58:33.184]  But the Al-Qaeda will actually kill our troops.
[00:58:34.145 --> 00:58:34.726]  It's real.
[00:58:34.726 --> 00:58:36.808]  It's just the globalists are running both puppets.
[00:58:36.808 --> 00:58:38.069]  We'll be back with a second hour.
[00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.850]  Stay with us.
[00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:40.312]  Have a special guest joining us.
[00:58:40.312 --> 00:58:41.093]  Tons of news.
[00:58:41.093 --> 00:58:43.555]  We haven't even skimmed the surface.
[00:58:43.555 --> 00:58:45.057]  But it did cover a lot.
[00:58:45.057 --> 00:58:46.538]  Give us an A-plus for that hour.
[00:58:46.538 --> 00:58:46.859]  Stay with us.
[00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:50.802]  I don't know what it is.
[00:58:50.802 --> 00:58:52.683]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[00:58:52.683 --> 00:58:56.806]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[00:58:56.806 --> 00:58:58.408]  It's like I don't even exist.
[00:58:58.408 --> 00:59:00.349]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:01.710]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:04.452]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[00:59:04.452 --> 00:59:09.877]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[00:59:09.877 --> 00:59:14.920]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.643]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[00:59:17.643 --> 00:59:18.063]  Look it up.
[00:59:18.303 --> 00:59:25.172]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:45.791]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:45.791 --> 00:59:47.332]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:09.449]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.449 --> 01:00:11.030]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:12.571]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.571 --> 01:00:16.775]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.775 --> 01:00:20.858]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:40.230]  We are now into our number two.
[01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:42.971]  And we have the moves to censor and kill the internet as we know it.
[01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:44.411]  We've been breaking down.
[01:00:44.411 --> 01:00:46.012]  We have new breaking news.
[01:00:46.012 --> 01:00:46.992]  We're all over the country.
[01:00:46.992 --> 01:00:55.396]  Locals are saying, why are you getting giant brand new war tanks, wheeled war tanks?
[01:00:55.396 --> 01:00:56.896]  And why are you setting up checkpoints?
[01:00:56.896 --> 01:00:59.957]  And why are you buying all these guns and weapons for us?
[01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:01.138]  Well, Wisconsin police
[01:01:02.443 --> 01:01:07.665]  Reassure residents they won't be shot at from military truck.
[01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:12.347]  Police work to dispel negative public perception of use of military domestically.
[01:01:12.347 --> 01:01:13.647]  Don't run.
[01:01:13.647 --> 01:01:16.368]  We are your friends.
[01:01:16.368 --> 01:01:22.391]  To quote Mars Attacks or Waco, the tank, the Bradley fighting vehicle, smashing in and shooting the people.
[01:01:22.391 --> 01:01:24.611]  They were saying this is not an assault, this is not an assault.
[01:01:24.611 --> 01:01:25.872]  Come out with your hands up and they'd kill them.
[01:01:27.008 --> 01:01:29.208]  To teach them a lesson, including the little kids.
[01:01:29.208 --> 01:01:44.231]  When the ATF opened fire on the Davidians as a PR stunt, and the Davidians fought back, the ATF put their hands up, they let them retreat, and they came back, encircled them for 50 plus days, and then burned the place down, with the children inside.
[01:01:44.231 --> 01:01:52.933]  So, that's what's happening, and we're gonna have pharmacist Ben Fuchs on, GCN host, one of my favorite guests, because I heard him a few weeks ago on his own show,
[01:01:54.181 --> 01:02:08.164]  Breaking down the epigenetics and quoting the studies, and he always sends us great bibliographies of what he breaks down, about how the conspiracy to not breastfeed is so incredible.
[01:02:08.164 --> 01:02:14.706]  And to end the human family as we know it, people have much smaller brains, they're brain damaged.
[01:02:14.706 --> 01:02:17.567]  Now, you might have had 170 IQ, but you didn't get breastfed, so it's 120.
[01:02:19.767 --> 01:02:24.252]  And I'm not saying you're a bad person because you weren't breastfed, but this is a big deal.
[01:02:24.252 --> 01:02:26.655]  And this is something people need to know.
[01:02:26.655 --> 01:02:34.444]  So we'll look at epigenetics and how we're treated as a child, as a baby, expresses the genes that are already in us.
[01:02:34.444 --> 01:02:36.467]  They always debate, is it nature or is it nurture?
[01:02:36.467 --> 01:02:37.348]  And those are the two schools.
[01:02:38.783 --> 01:02:43.967]  Well, it is nature, but nurture is how those genes are activated.
[01:02:43.967 --> 01:02:45.868]  And that's been proven now.
[01:02:45.868 --> 01:02:47.249]  They've encoded the genes.
[01:02:47.249 --> 01:02:48.670]  It's incredible.
[01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.392]  It's not just in mammals.
[01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:55.376]  And the globalists are trying to program our genes to keep them from expressing certain ways.
[01:02:55.376 --> 01:02:57.397]  So they don't have to even engineer us.
[01:02:57.397 --> 01:02:59.799]  They can engineer our genes from the outside.
[01:02:59.799 --> 01:03:03.642]  They don't have to change it before the embryo forms in the zygote.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:10.442]  They don't have to change it in genetic engineering of the sperm and the egg, or the systems they use.
[01:03:10.442 --> 01:03:13.644]  And they've got literally thousands of chimeras, part monkey, part human.
[01:03:13.644 --> 01:03:15.224]  That's in the news today.
[01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.285]  In fact, that's in my stack.
[01:03:16.285 --> 01:03:17.525]  I was trying to find it.
[01:03:17.525 --> 01:03:18.826]  The era of chimeras.
[01:03:18.826 --> 01:03:22.288]  Scientists fearlessly create bizarre human-animal hybrids.
[01:03:22.288 --> 01:03:29.771]  We're going to talk with Ben Fuchs about what they're not doing that's natural, like breastfeeding and stuff, and then what they're moving ahead with.
[01:03:32.318 --> 01:03:36.559]  To break down monkeys that are part jellyfish, dogs that are part human.
[01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:40.700]  They've got fish that have got more than 50 different plants, animals, insects in them.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:46.841]  And this is causing zoological spread, cross-species jumping of things that shouldn't.
[01:03:46.841 --> 01:03:49.942]  I mean, this is definitely beyond the island of Dr. Maru.
[01:03:49.942 --> 01:03:57.183]  But just like I told you they were putting brain chips in troops 10 years ago, now it's declassified they've been doing it for 10 years, like I told you.
[01:03:57.183 --> 01:03:58.964]  Or just like I told you they were taking baby's blood,
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.620]  I told you that in 1996 because a nurse at a military base gave me all the documents.
[01:04:05.862 --> 01:04:07.762]  It took more than a decade until 2006.
[01:04:07.762 --> 01:04:11.823]  That broke in Texas and in Minnesota.
[01:04:11.823 --> 01:04:19.584]  My listener sued, found out it was true, and it goes in a secret Rockefeller Brothers, Cold Springs Harbor, U.N.
[01:04:19.584 --> 01:04:20.605]  facility.
[01:04:20.605 --> 01:04:26.326]  The most famous eugenics facility in the world, after the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, is Cold Springs Harbor.
[01:04:26.326 --> 01:04:28.846]  That's the genome project under IBM.
[01:04:28.846 --> 01:04:32.647]  Your blood goes there, and it's for bioweapons.
[01:04:32.647 --> 01:04:34.367]  They can create a bioweapon that just kills you.
[01:04:36.274 --> 01:04:38.156]  They've got it all.
[01:04:38.156 --> 01:04:40.398]  And that's the main master center.
[01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:42.520]  They've got a big underground base there.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.542]  The NSA's freaking out over that statement.
[01:04:44.542 --> 01:04:46.944]  Yes, I have the secret intel.
[01:04:46.944 --> 01:04:47.825]  And the globalists know it.
[01:04:47.825 --> 01:04:49.467]  That's why they have all my phones tapped and everything else.
[01:04:49.467 --> 01:04:51.349]  It doesn't matter.
[01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:55.032]  I got this information a long time ago.
[01:04:55.032 --> 01:04:56.353]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:56.353 --> 01:04:56.754]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.904 --> 01:05:03.926]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:05:03.926 --> 01:05:08.308]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:05:08.308 --> 01:05:11.970]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:15.011]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:22.575]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:05:22.575 --> 01:05:26.217]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:05:26.477 --> 01:05:30.902]  New filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:05:30.902 --> 01:05:36.868]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:05:36.868 --> 01:05:40.813]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:05:40.813 --> 01:05:43.555]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:05:43.555 --> 01:05:44.897]  The establishment's not gonna do it.
[01:05:45.037 --> 01:05:46.417]  It's time to take action.
[01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:48.238]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:06.902]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:06:07.042 --> 01:06:09.403]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:06:09.403 --> 01:06:14.665]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:06:14.665 --> 01:06:19.848]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:06:19.848 --> 01:06:22.889]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:06:23.169 --> 01:06:27.232]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:06:27.232 --> 01:06:31.575]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:06:31.575 --> 01:06:41.803]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[01:06:41.803 --> 01:06:44.305]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:06:44.505 --> 01:06:52.708]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:56.670]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:59.671 --> 01:07:02.713]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:02.713 --> 01:07:04.874]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[01:07:04.874 --> 01:07:11.057]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[01:07:11.057 --> 01:07:16.140]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:21.022]  The new InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[01:07:21.022 --> 01:07:25.525]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[01:07:25.825 --> 01:07:34.428]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:07:34.428 --> 01:07:36.589]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:47.753]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.584]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:08.865]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:38.626 --> 01:08:44.268]  My friends, I want to try to boil this down very calmly for you and for myself.
[01:08:44.268 --> 01:08:46.309]  I want to just get this out.
[01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:48.790]  What we have is a breakaway civilization.
[01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:57.954]  The establishment, the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group, openly call themselves technocrats.
[01:08:57.954 --> 01:09:01.736]  And the vein that runs through all of their public communications
[01:09:03.786 --> 01:09:24.650]  Is that they are the anointed, they are the high priests of the world, they are the scientists, they are going to get life extension technology, they are going to become God, they are going to merge with the singularity, and that you, the profane, do not deserve to go into this new age technocracy that they're building.
[01:09:31.897 --> 01:09:35.479]  We are going to become gods.
[01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:36.000]  Period.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.422]  If you don't like it, get off.
[01:09:39.422 --> 01:09:40.803]  You don't have to contribute.
[01:09:40.803 --> 01:09:43.064]  You don't have to participate.
[01:09:43.064 --> 01:09:51.609]  But if you're going to interfere with me becoming god, then you're going to have big trouble.
[01:09:51.609 --> 01:09:53.850]  Then we'll have warfare.
[01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:59.714]  That's Richard Seed, big physicist, and that's the standard thing that Bill Joy wrote in
[01:10:01.272 --> 01:10:08.356]  Why the Future Doesn't Need Us article 14 years ago for Wired Magazine, the owner of Sun Microsystems, the chairman.
[01:10:08.356 --> 01:10:17.542]  He said, I was in a meeting with 200 elite, top tech company owners, and the discussion over the weekend was, do we kill everybody?
[01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:20.304]  Or do we let people just be entertained like in the movie WALL-E?
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:28.262]  And just lay around with robots servicing them all day, you know, taking care of them, bringing us pina coladas.
[01:10:28.262 --> 01:10:36.403]  And the elite have made the decision that that's a waste of resources and that they need to decide how to just get rid of us.
[01:10:36.403 --> 01:10:46.386]  As humanely as possible, of course, so that they can ascend and transcend in the transcendence.
[01:10:46.386 --> 01:10:47.726]  And safeguard the Earth.
[01:10:49.298 --> 01:10:52.339]  As the new Johnny Depp movie basically sells.
[01:10:52.339 --> 01:10:59.482]  A guardian nanotech to control everything and reduce the population.
[01:10:59.482 --> 01:11:16.048]  There's an article up on Infowars.com by Michael Schneider, excellent writer, and he has a big bibliography here from the Daily Mail, the Associated Press, The Independent, Slate.com, TheAge.com,
[01:11:18.015 --> 01:11:25.563]  And the reason I mention the bibliography of this, the sources, is whenever I talk about this, we invariably get emails and calls and I'm crazy.
[01:11:25.563 --> 01:11:28.106]  That's how ignorant the public is.
[01:11:28.106 --> 01:11:34.512]  They don't know that for 50 years they've been cloning rabbits.
[01:11:34.512 --> 01:11:38.136]  They don't know that it was declassified in the mid-90s, that 20 years before.
[01:11:41.983 --> 01:11:53.186]  In laboratories in South Korea and in England and other places, they had cloned humans in the test tube, but reportedly killed the embryo before it grew.
[01:11:53.186 --> 01:12:01.848]  And then they passed laws saying, yes, cloning is banned if you, you know, get rid of it at, say, a month old.
[01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:16.614]  And they've got facilities growing humanoids and harvesting it, but they don't have rights because they've got pig DNA, rat DNA, guinea pig DNA, fish DNA, lizard DNA.
[01:12:16.614 --> 01:12:17.895]  It's beyond anything.
[01:12:17.895 --> 01:12:25.357]  I remember seeing a Washington Post footnote about 10 or 12 years ago when I was on Coast to Coast AM with a guy named Ian Punnett.
[01:12:26.638 --> 01:12:34.261]  And I brought it up and he was freaking out and he goes, I want to see where there's pharmacological crops that grow HIV virus in them in Texas.
[01:12:34.261 --> 01:12:37.663]  He looked it up and freaked out there it was.
[01:12:37.663 --> 01:12:39.543]  People didn't know back then that crops can grow anything.
[01:12:39.543 --> 01:12:41.284]  You can program a plant to grow basically anything.
[01:12:41.284 --> 01:12:49.747]  You can have it grow chemicals, whatever you want, viruses, whatever you want.
[01:12:49.747 --> 01:12:53.289]  And then I said, well, if you think that's a big deal, then we're going to go to our guest.
[01:12:54.670 --> 01:13:01.392]  You know, I said, I saw a Washington Post article where it mentioned they had a Humanzes at a Costa Rica U.S.
[01:13:01.392 --> 01:13:07.494]  government-funded lab, but because it's part chimpanzee, part human, it has no rights.
[01:13:07.494 --> 01:13:10.976]  And he freaked out about that, and we went and pulled it up, and there it was.
[01:13:10.976 --> 01:13:14.217]  And I don't blame people going, oh, come on, you know.
[01:13:14.217 --> 01:13:16.718]  This is going on, folks.
[01:13:16.718 --> 01:13:20.699]  And I've told the story a hundred times or more.
[01:13:20.699 --> 01:13:22.900]  My wife was pregnant, so it was about 12 years ago.
[01:13:24.637 --> 01:13:29.440]  And I was at the pizza place and a guy poked me in the back and said, I used to listen to you, but you're a liar.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.141]  Now, you know, I went to UT and I didn't have a biology degree.
[01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:35.403]  There's no such thing as a part goat, part spider.
[01:13:35.403 --> 01:13:43.187]  And I just said, yeah, there is, and get out of my face.
[01:13:43.187 --> 01:13:46.248]  And I still get that.
[01:13:46.248 --> 01:13:50.590]  It's like the globalists are on record saying they put fluoride in the water to brain damage you and your family.
[01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:52.051]  They should all be arrested.
[01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:53.292]  Ecoscience, why not science, sir?
[01:13:54.465 --> 01:14:00.049]  They're public, not caring if 91% of the 400 plus reactors are leaking worldwide.
[01:14:00.049 --> 01:14:01.870]  They don't care.
[01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:04.772]  They're public saying your kids belong to them.
[01:14:04.772 --> 01:14:11.858]  They're public, if you go back to the 50s, knowing that when they gave babies formula, that it wasn't even set up right.
[01:14:11.858 --> 01:14:21.685]  Not to mention the colostrum and the antibodies and the fact that it's your mother's vaccines and her entire mitochondrial history of immunities passed on from women going back into the
[01:14:23.407 --> 01:14:34.997]  Fogs shrouded past that they're breaking that chain of literal programming juice and pharmacist Ben Fuchs is a top formulator in the country and compounding pharmacist and smarter than most doctors I know.
[01:14:34.997 --> 01:14:36.518]  Most doctors I know say talk to a pharmacist.
[01:14:36.518 --> 01:14:38.120]  Well, that's what we talked to.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:51.131]  He can quantify with the studies, I have a stack of them, how the first three months of milk is literally activation juice and it doesn't carry the memories, the race memories, it activates the race memories.
[01:14:53.977 --> 01:15:07.604]  And it's also designed for the stress the woman's under, what is she facing, what's happening with her will affect her milk to then program the baby with the type of threat they're facing to select the genes to be flipped on.
[01:15:07.604 --> 01:15:09.205]  That's in the studies.
[01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:12.887]  Now how nanotech is that of God?
[01:15:12.887 --> 01:15:14.148]  Or the universe, whatever you want to call it.
[01:15:17.634 --> 01:15:39.087]  Whatever the woman's going through in her pregnancy, her stress, whatever she's going through, whatever she's got deficiencies in, everything, while the baby's in utero, through the placenta the body's trying to get the baby ready for whatever it's facing in the environment, when the baby comes out, the milk is now programming for whatever the woman's facing through the baby to activate genes.
[01:15:39.087 --> 01:15:40.327]  And that's in major studies.
[01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:44.730]  He's here to join us just on that one area.
[01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:46.011]  You go look at the major
[01:15:47.469 --> 01:15:48.430]  In fact, you guys can do this.
[01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:52.013]  Run to H-E-B and buy me a couple of the establishment formulas right now.
[01:15:52.013 --> 01:15:52.714]  I got some.
[01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:53.955]  I don't have any cash left in my wallet.
[01:15:53.955 --> 01:15:55.116]  Just grab it from Weldon.
[01:15:55.116 --> 01:15:58.198]  Run there quick before Fuchs has to leave us 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:15:59.172 --> 01:16:00.853]  Because I meant to do this and I forgot to do it.
[01:16:00.853 --> 01:16:04.534]  I want to show you what we've done on air before with Mike Adams when he came in.
[01:16:04.534 --> 01:16:12.838]  I mean, it's like 50% sugar or high fructose corn syrup, 25% more sugar, 75% sugar, almost no fat.
[01:16:12.838 --> 01:16:14.058]  And then it's not even the type of fat you need.
[01:16:14.058 --> 01:16:18.360]  Then it's soy that basically programs the male babies to be feminine.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:23.062]  I mean, we've got the expert here to join us, BrightSideBen.com.
[01:16:23.062 --> 01:16:25.944]  He joins us now to break this down.
[01:16:25.944 --> 01:16:28.305]  But imagine the diabolical nature.
[01:16:29.825 --> 01:16:31.607]  I mean, women have breasts for a reason.
[01:16:31.607 --> 01:16:32.687]  All mammals have them.
[01:16:32.687 --> 01:16:33.468]  Whales, you name it.
[01:16:33.468 --> 01:16:35.249]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:16:35.249 --> 01:16:37.710]  Babies need mother's milk.
[01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:41.592]  That's why, genetically, men like women with nice breasts.
[01:16:41.592 --> 01:16:44.174]  Genetically, we're saying that can produce a lot of milk.
[01:16:44.174 --> 01:16:46.775]  Women with wide hips, that's Marilyn Monroe.
[01:16:46.775 --> 01:16:48.656]  This is a woman that can have kids.
[01:16:48.656 --> 01:16:50.958]  This is a woman that's feminine and wants to take care of babies.
[01:16:51.618 --> 01:16:52.819]  Well, they don't want women feminine.
[01:16:52.819 --> 01:16:54.359]  They don't want men to be warriors.
[01:16:54.359 --> 01:17:00.342]  They're attacking the species like the globalists are an alien programming group.
[01:17:00.342 --> 01:17:03.583]  And I don't believe that's what they are, but I'm saying it might as well be that.
[01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:09.246]  They're psychopaths who are alien to the normal human activity, who have scientifically decided to destroy us.
[01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:11.447]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, we're skipping this network break.
[01:17:11.447 --> 01:17:12.528]  It's so important.
[01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:14.649]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:17:14.649 --> 01:17:19.010]  You've heard my layman's breakdown of these reports we're going to go over.
[01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:19.871]  Break it down for us.
[01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.543]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:17:21.543 --> 01:17:24.947]  Epigenetics means power, and it means power for us.
[01:17:24.947 --> 01:17:29.352]  Genetics, the notion of genetics has to do with destiny.
[01:17:29.352 --> 01:17:31.994]  It says that whatever is in your genes is the way you're going to be.
[01:17:31.994 --> 01:17:35.558]  And this is one of the most disempowering ideas in all of health and in all of biology.
[01:17:35.558 --> 01:17:42.746]  The idea of epigenetics and the idea of a transcendent level of control over the genome, which is what breast milk represents, by the way,
[01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:53.515]  Put the power back in the hands of the individual, takes the power away from the hands of the Leviathan, as I call it, the beast, the state, the model, however you want to term it.
[01:17:53.515 --> 01:17:56.318]  And this is one of the most powerful ideas that we have in all of health.
[01:17:56.318 --> 01:18:07.248]  And it's something that we've known about for a long time, but because of the hegemony of the medical model, the hegemony of the medical professionals, most people believe that whatever is in their genes is the way that they're going to be.
[01:18:07.925 --> 01:18:12.867]  How many times have you heard people say, oh, it's just in my genes, oh, that's my genetics, oh, it runs in the family.
[01:18:12.867 --> 01:18:24.651]  The notion that there is a control point that is transcendent or epi, that's what the word epi means, to genetic destiny is a powerful, powerful idea for the individual and it's something that we want to exploit.
[01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:29.933]  You were bringing to the forefront the idea of breast milk.
[01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:41.879]  Breast milk is an epigenetic vehicle that is designed to turn genes on and off in response to the environment that both the mother is confronting and the baby is confronting.
[01:18:41.879 --> 01:18:46.082]  Please, mothers, breast milk is a divine programming source.
[01:18:46.082 --> 01:18:47.302]  Alex, you hit the nail on the head.
[01:18:47.302 --> 01:18:50.384]  You called it a high-tech programming device.
[01:18:50.384 --> 01:18:51.405]  That's really what it is.
[01:18:51.405 --> 01:18:55.607]  It's a divine programming device that's designed to keep a baby healthy.
[01:18:55.607 --> 01:18:58.909]  We know that epigenetic factors in breast milk... Women's breasts are magical!
[01:19:00.009 --> 01:19:00.929]  That's right.
[01:19:00.929 --> 01:19:02.290]  Everything about them is magical.
[01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:04.430]  But what they secrete is especially magical.
[01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:19.113]  In terms of epigenetics, the factors in breast milk, aside from the nutritional factors, you know, you can get formula that has the vitamins and you can get formula that has the minerals and some of the co-factors, but these epigenetic factors are things that we've just begun to understand over the last 20 or 30 years.
[01:19:19.113 --> 01:19:20.293]  Formulas don't contain those.
[01:19:20.293 --> 01:19:22.394]  It's literally full of the antibodies, everything.
[01:19:23.135 --> 01:19:28.021]  And again, quantifying this from the studies, but I want you to expand on it with your expertise, studying this for years.
[01:19:28.021 --> 01:19:37.494]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs joining us, is that suddenly there's all these genetic disorders and people are suddenly, you know, 10,000% increases in pediatric children's cancers, 3,000% in breast cancer.
[01:19:38.715 --> 01:19:40.436]  And they go, oh, it's because you have bad genes.
[01:19:40.436 --> 01:19:46.919]  Well, of course, if you're not getting what you need, you are predisposed in your genes to malfunction this way.
[01:19:46.919 --> 01:19:53.983]  If you don't have the building blocks and you weren't breastfed, and instead you're given a bunch of deadly vaccines, they want their system.
[01:19:53.983 --> 01:19:57.165]  I mean, why should anyone get a hepatitis shot at birth?
[01:19:57.165 --> 01:20:00.006]  I mean, is the baby going to be having, you know, sex?
[01:20:00.006 --> 01:20:02.428]  Is the baby going to be injecting heroin?
[01:20:02.428 --> 01:20:03.048]  It's incredible.
[01:20:03.328 --> 01:20:05.791]  Breast milk is the best vaccination you could get.
[01:20:05.791 --> 01:20:07.393]  It's God's vaccination.
[01:20:07.393 --> 01:20:15.682]  Breast milk protects us from fatty liver disease, it protects us from autoimmune disease, it protects us from cancer, it protects us from cholesterol and blood fats, it protects us from heart disease.
[01:20:15.682 --> 01:20:20.448]  These are factors that are in breast milk that the baby is going to get and that are going to impart protection for the baby.
[01:20:20.908 --> 01:20:23.149]  For the rest of the baby's life.
[01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:29.530]  This is so important, and that doesn't even include the psychological benefits to these epigenetic factors.
[01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:40.512]  We know lack of these epigenetic factors can result in stress diseases, in alert helplessness, emotional disorders, autism, schizophrenia.
[01:20:40.512 --> 01:20:44.053]  This is above and beyond the protection that we get from physical malady.
[01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:50.076]  By the way, while you're talking, I'm showing mainstream research papers from prestigious universities.
[01:20:50.076 --> 01:20:51.337]  This is well known.
[01:20:51.337 --> 01:20:52.378]  This has been well known.
[01:20:52.378 --> 01:20:53.979]  I graduated pharmacy school in 1986.
[01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:57.161]  I had professors telling me about epigenetics back then.
[01:20:57.161 --> 01:21:04.805]  Today, we're starting to hear about it more and more, but we've known about a control point of the genetics, a control point to genes for 50 or 60 years.
[01:21:04.805 --> 01:21:08.427]  In fact, the word epigenetics was coined in the 1950s, I believe.
[01:21:08.427 --> 01:21:09.868]  So these are not new ideas.
[01:21:09.868 --> 01:21:13.370]  These may be new ideas to the mainstream, but these are not new ideas to biologists.
[01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:20.394]  By the way, I'm showing .gov, the Centers for Disease Control, the NIH, you name it, they're all admitting this.
[01:21:20.394 --> 01:21:24.936]  Well, geneticists know this idea of one gene, one protein, one gene, one disease.
[01:21:24.936 --> 01:21:27.557]  Today I was reading about how they found the gene for baldness.
[01:21:27.557 --> 01:21:29.138]  You know how you hear this every once in a while?
[01:21:29.138 --> 01:21:31.159]  Oh, they found the gene for Alzheimer's disease.
[01:21:31.159 --> 01:21:33.000]  They found the gene for cancer.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.463]  There is no one gene for baldness or for Alzheimer's disease or for cancer.
[01:21:37.463 --> 01:21:41.965]  Genes turn on and off based on epigenetic factors that are nutritional, that are emotional,
[01:21:42.165 --> 01:21:42.345]  Thank you!
[01:22:01.152 --> 01:22:03.374]  And you never have no idea what you're going to be getting.
[01:22:03.374 --> 01:22:12.883]  This is such an important idea for scientists who, to be so glib with the fundamental component of the intelligence of life, which is what the genome is, is horrific.
[01:22:12.883 --> 01:22:16.105]  Well, obviously mammals need their mother's milk.
[01:22:17.006 --> 01:22:20.990]  And they've pretty much got up to the point where they harass women that try to breastfeed.
[01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:22.432]  The media acts like it's weird.
[01:22:22.432 --> 01:22:29.459]  I mean, if they have their way, someday it will be a conspiracy theory to say that women ever even breastfed or even gave birth.
[01:22:29.459 --> 01:22:36.806]  Notice how they, like 60-something percent of hospitals now, force women to have cesareans because then every other baby, they get to do that.
[01:22:36.806 --> 01:22:37.887]  It affects the child.
[01:22:37.887 --> 01:22:40.130]  I mean, it's just a scam.
[01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:48.577]  When a baby comes out of the womb, it's coated with bacteria, and that bacteria become that baby's personal health guardians for the rest of that baby's life.
[01:22:48.577 --> 01:22:57.844]  That bacteria, those bacteria that coat the baby as it leaves the womb and enters into the world, they get into the baby's mouth, they go into the baby's digestive tract, they implant in the baby's womb.
[01:22:57.844 --> 01:23:03.709]  Those bacteria protect a baby from colon cancer, from digestive distress, from heart disease, from
[01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:05.310]  It's no
[01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:33.764]  It's no wonder people are on antibiotics from birth till death.
[01:23:33.764 --> 01:23:38.532]  It's no wonder people glow in the dark now and, you know, look like they can't even pick up a five pound weight.
[01:23:38.888 --> 01:23:52.496]  Oh, and we haven't even gotten to the bisphenol A and the pesticides and the toxic effects of epigenetics, the relationship between poisons, the relationship between pollutants, the relationship between prescription medications and the genome.
[01:23:52.496 --> 01:24:05.845]  Well, I want you to get into that in the next segment, but right now, because I heard your show a few weeks ago, you were breaking it all down, get into the science, the different co-factors that's in the breast milk, so people understand how important this is, that the major wiring of the brain happens the first two years,
[01:24:06.865 --> 01:24:09.667]  Uh, you know, and then up to age 5, it's fully mapping.
[01:24:09.667 --> 01:24:11.188]  I mean, this is the time.
[01:24:11.188 --> 01:24:13.509]  They tell, put kids on low-fat diets.
[01:24:13.509 --> 01:24:15.610]  Well, it's trans fats that are bad.
[01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:17.912]  Don't children need more fat than adults?
[01:24:17.912 --> 01:24:18.552]  Heck yes!
[01:24:18.552 --> 01:24:20.533]  And what's more, they need more cholesterol than adults.
[01:24:20.533 --> 01:24:21.534]  How do you like that?
[01:24:21.534 --> 01:24:25.096]  Cholesterol, which we've been talking about, and you and I have been talking about it for probably for...
[01:24:25.356 --> 01:24:27.397]  Three or four years now about how poor cholesterol is.
[01:24:27.397 --> 01:24:34.680]  Cholesterol is a prime building substance, not just for cells, not just for muscles, but for the brain and for the nervous system.
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.341]  Alex, it's like there's a conspiracy to destroy our minds.
[01:24:38.341 --> 01:24:41.642]  There's a conspiracy to destroy our ability to think clearly.
[01:24:41.642 --> 01:24:48.805]  There's a conspiracy to destroy the prefrontal cortex, the executive center, the choice center, the part of our brain that makes us human.
[01:24:49.185 --> 01:24:58.430]  There's a conspiracy to promote the lizard brain, the reptilian brain, the survival brain, the fear brain, the part of our brain that shuts down our ability to heal and to thrive.
[01:24:58.430 --> 01:25:09.577]  We are in survival mode psychologically, we're in survival mode emotionally, and now we're in survival mode epigenetically and physically through manipulation of the genome, through prescription drugs, through poisons in the environment.
[01:25:10.237 --> 01:25:17.403]  And through lack of information, through misunderstandings that promote the idea that we have to be what our genetics say we are.
[01:25:17.403 --> 01:25:28.571]  The fact of the matter is you go to any geneticist and they'll tell you that this idea of one gene being related to one protein or one gene being related to one kind of specific physical feature is not true.
[01:25:28.571 --> 01:25:33.275]  It's simplistic and it's ignorant and what's worse, it's a control trip.
[01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:41.498]  And it's a profit center as well because it allows pharmaceutical companies to come up with medications that manipulate the genes.
[01:25:41.498 --> 01:25:45.299]  And this is what the latest pharmaceuticals do.
[01:25:45.299 --> 01:25:56.143]  They work at the genetic level with this idea that by pharmacologically addressing the gene, by pharmacologically changing the gene, you can impart health.
[01:25:56.143 --> 01:25:59.905]  How the heck can a human being who knows nothing
[01:26:00.305 --> 01:26:04.168]  About the genetics of the body, which is really basically what we know.
[01:26:04.168 --> 01:26:06.589]  One to two percent of the gene is thought to be active.
[01:26:06.589 --> 01:26:07.170]  Let me interrupt.
[01:26:07.170 --> 01:26:10.532]  Just look at what antibiotics were great, but overused.
[01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:12.053]  All the nightmares they created.
[01:26:12.053 --> 01:26:14.935]  Look at how everything ends up turning out to be worse down the road.
[01:26:14.935 --> 01:26:18.517]  Now they've got thousands of facilities with gene guns, as you know.
[01:26:18.517 --> 01:26:22.580]  Just randomly splicing RNA, DNA, chimeras.
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:23.661]  Talk about that some.
[01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:25.122]  What do you make of crossing...
[01:26:26.062 --> 01:26:27.044]  Yeah, well, H.G.
[01:26:27.044 --> 01:26:28.806]  Wells wrote... How do you like the fact that H.G.
[01:26:28.806 --> 01:26:33.131]  Wells wrote The Island of Dr. Moreau in 1896?
[01:26:33.131 --> 01:26:42.443]  120 years ago, he knew that there would be this idea of manipulating genomes of different animals, building things together, creating these... He wrote about atomic wars in 1900.
[01:26:42.443 --> 01:26:43.805]  He was a master Illuminati.
[01:26:43.945 --> 01:26:46.487]  Isn't that amazing how he knew all this stuff?
[01:26:46.487 --> 01:26:46.827]  It's crazy.
[01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:49.729]  But the idea of chimeras is really what we're confronting.
[01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:53.092]  This is the next likely step in genetic modification.
[01:26:53.092 --> 01:26:56.354]  We have GMO plants, which are basically chimera plants.
[01:26:56.354 --> 01:26:59.376]  How big a leap is it to chimera animals?
[01:26:59.376 --> 01:27:02.819]  How big a leap is it to chimera humanoids, for that matter?
[01:27:04.175 --> 01:27:04.856]  They've already done it.
[01:27:04.856 --> 01:27:05.596]  They don't have any rights.
[01:27:05.596 --> 01:27:06.677]  They just keep them in laboratories.
[01:27:06.677 --> 01:27:08.138]  It's on record.
[01:27:08.138 --> 01:27:13.041]  But I mean, you know, the animal rights groups talk about animals having rights, which I agree they do have some, obviously.
[01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:15.283]  How we treat animals is how we treat ourselves.
[01:27:15.283 --> 01:27:17.885]  Especially the higher order elephants, dogs, you name it.
[01:27:17.885 --> 01:27:19.766]  But what about these chimeras?
[01:27:19.766 --> 01:27:20.707]  Don't they have rights?
[01:27:20.707 --> 01:27:23.409]  These pigs that have human genetics in them?
[01:27:25.091 --> 01:27:26.332]  That's the next step.
[01:27:26.332 --> 01:27:31.298]  It truly is a scary world that we're confronting.
[01:27:31.298 --> 01:27:36.163]  But Alex, I'll tell you, I've said this so many times, we can't let fear get the best of us.
[01:27:36.163 --> 01:27:37.665]  We've got to expose this.
[01:27:37.665 --> 01:27:38.686]  We've got to not
[01:27:38.986 --> 01:27:39.447]  I agree.
[01:27:39.447 --> 01:27:41.189]  In the next segment, I want to get into solutions.
[01:28:01.329 --> 01:28:04.192]  And I want to be clear, and I'm not saying you're saying this, but I want to be clear.
[01:28:04.192 --> 01:28:05.854]  I'm not fear-mongering.
[01:28:05.854 --> 01:28:10.980]  I want people to know how bad it is, like telling my neighbor, hey, your house is on fire.
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.061]  Right, you have to know.
[01:28:12.061 --> 01:28:15.325]  Exactly, because people need to know we're already deep into this.
[01:28:17.196 --> 01:28:18.337]  We are deep into this.
[01:28:18.337 --> 01:28:19.278]  That's absolutely the case.
[01:28:19.278 --> 01:28:25.445]  I mean, by the time the lay public hears about something, it's already been in the scientific literature for decades.
[01:28:25.445 --> 01:28:27.727]  Sometimes for three or four, even five decades.
[01:28:27.727 --> 01:28:37.497]  So, if you hear about something in the New York Times, or in the Daily News, or in Time Magazine, or Newsweek, you can rest assured that scientists have been discussing this in the literature for decades, and it's the same with epigenetics and genetics.
[01:28:38.178 --> 01:28:45.164]  Genetics, the genome was discovered in the 1950s, epigenetics, the ideas of epigenetics was discovered shortly thereafter.
[01:28:45.164 --> 01:28:54.571]  Today we know that our genes blink on and off like Christmas tree lights, but still, not only does the average person not understand this, the average medical professional doesn't understand this.
[01:28:54.571 --> 01:28:59.495]  That our genes are as flexible as our environment, and this is the beautiful thing about epigenetics.
[01:28:59.495 --> 01:29:04.438]  Epigenetics is the way that the genes read the environment.
[01:29:04.438 --> 01:29:07.361]  Could it become a drug to have lactating women?
[01:29:08.221 --> 01:29:11.602]  Uh, start selling their colostrum to people that never had it?
[01:29:11.602 --> 01:29:16.703]  Even though you won't get your family's genetic history, you will get the genetic history of those people?
[01:29:16.703 --> 01:29:23.505]  You know, if you think breast milk is powerful, and breast milk is powerful medicine, colostrum is, is the breast milk of the breast milk.
[01:29:23.505 --> 01:29:25.586]  It's the, it's the core of the breast milk.
[01:29:25.586 --> 01:29:27.786]  It is the most concentrated food on the planet.
[01:29:27.786 --> 01:29:36.589]  I want you to describe what comes out the first few days, then the weeks, then months, and then I want to get into solutions, and then I also want to look at what you're saying about epigenetics, the negative stuff.
[01:29:37.609 --> 01:29:39.370]  What is the bisphenol A doing?
[01:29:39.370 --> 01:29:43.491]  What is the other chemicals out there like the glyphosate?
[01:29:43.491 --> 01:29:45.171]  What is it doing with our genes?
[01:29:45.171 --> 01:29:45.631]  Well, they admit it.
[01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:47.372]  It's flipping on the breast cancer.
[01:29:47.372 --> 01:29:48.372]  We'll be right back with Ben Fuge.
[01:29:48.372 --> 01:29:49.312]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.312 --> 01:29:50.693]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.693 --> 01:29:53.213]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.213 --> 01:30:01.256]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.256 --> 01:30:02.156]  In the near future,
[01:30:02.739 --> 01:30:05.040]  Do you realize how fake it all is?
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.581]  The football, the basketball.
[01:30:06.581 --> 01:30:07.181]  Alert.
[01:30:07.181 --> 01:30:07.901]  Security.
[01:30:07.901 --> 01:30:08.421]  Alert.
[01:30:08.421 --> 01:30:10.462]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:30:10.462 --> 01:30:11.362]  Analysis.
[01:30:11.362 --> 01:30:14.164]  InfoWars building independent media operation.
[01:30:14.164 --> 01:30:19.206]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:30:19.206 --> 01:30:20.266]  Crime directive.
[01:30:20.266 --> 01:30:21.827]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:30:21.827 --> 01:30:24.748]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:30:24.748 --> 01:30:27.849]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:30:28.129 --> 01:30:31.890]  I don't know what he is except a conspiracy theorist.
[01:30:31.890 --> 01:30:34.791]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:30:34.791 --> 01:30:36.792]  They're never going to stop.
[01:30:36.792 --> 01:30:40.913]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:30:40.913 --> 01:30:43.734]  Block free iPhone app at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:44.574 --> 01:30:53.825]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[01:30:53.825 --> 01:30:55.386]  Intellectually, it's begun!
[01:30:55.386 --> 01:30:56.087]  You can feel it!
[01:31:00.114 --> 01:31:02.616]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[01:31:02.616 --> 01:31:09.300]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:12.102]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[01:31:12.102 --> 01:31:14.043]  If not, then I want to know why.
[01:31:14.043 --> 01:31:16.345]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[01:31:16.345 --> 01:31:20.508]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[01:31:20.828 --> 01:31:21.989]  I say, so what?
[01:31:21.989 --> 01:31:24.190]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:27.573]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[01:31:27.573 --> 01:31:31.836]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[01:31:31.836 --> 01:31:36.159]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[01:31:36.539 --> 01:31:37.660]  I'm still fighting.
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.884]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[01:31:40.884 --> 01:31:42.705]  The Infowar is worldwide.
[01:31:42.705 --> 01:31:47.050]  Tell your friends about Infowars and let them know that Infowars doesn't print bull.
[01:31:47.050 --> 01:31:50.754]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[01:31:50.754 --> 01:31:58.021]  Step up and take your friends and family to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfowars.com.
[01:31:58.021 --> 01:31:59.563]  The truth will set them free.
[01:32:00.063 --> 01:32:04.127]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:32:04.127 --> 01:32:08.471]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:32:08.471 --> 01:32:12.154]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:32:12.154 --> 01:32:15.177]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:32:15.177 --> 01:32:22.744]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:32:22.744 --> 01:32:26.387]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:32:26.587 --> 01:32:31.073]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:32:31.073 --> 01:32:37.061]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:32:37.061 --> 01:32:40.986]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:32:40.986 --> 01:32:43.729]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:45.051]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:32:45.211 --> 01:32:46.592]  It's time to take action.
[01:32:46.592 --> 01:32:48.414]  It's time to filter our water.
[01:32:48.414 --> 01:32:55.800]  Visit InfowarsThor.com and use promo code WATER to get 10% off their entire family of incredible products.
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:33:02.706]  Or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:02.706 --> 01:33:06.288]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:06.288 --> 01:33:10.432]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:40.984 --> 01:33:52.548]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, pharmacist Ben Fuchs works with me at InfoWarsHealth.com with the products that we've got there that have really turned my life around.
[01:33:52.548 --> 01:34:02.911]  With the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, the PolymBurst Plus, the different chondroitin products they have for joints and things when I've had sports injuries.
[01:34:02.911 --> 01:34:08.593]  I used to be a big exercise guy and then for 15 years stopped working out except for hiking and literally gained almost 100 pounds.
[01:34:10.282 --> 01:34:21.501]  I've lost now total about 60 pounds of that I need to lose about another 35 pounds and I'll be back to what I weighed in the past and while I know
[01:34:24.133 --> 01:34:30.538]  Errol Flynn today, I will undoubtedly, the way I've been doing it slowly, get back to where I was.
[01:34:30.538 --> 01:34:36.042]  But what's really supercharged me and took me the rest of the way is not just the InfoWarsHealth.com products.
[01:34:36.042 --> 01:34:42.708]  You can go there and sign up and get auto-ship and get free shipping and other discounts at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:34:42.708 --> 01:34:48.932]  If you go to InfoWarsLife.com, you have the proprietary products that we have put out working with
[01:34:49.977 --> 01:34:52.638]  People like Dr. Edward Group and others.
[01:34:52.638 --> 01:34:59.442]  Super male vitality with eight concentrated herbs and fruit extracts that gives me better libido, energy, stamina.
[01:34:59.442 --> 01:35:03.264]  I mean, quite frankly, folks, it's simply amazing.
[01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:05.865]  You've heard the rave reviews from listeners.
[01:35:05.865 --> 01:35:10.967]  There's a video called Alex Jones is a fat ass up on Infowars.com.
[01:35:10.967 --> 01:35:13.209]  People say, has the site been hacked?
[01:35:13.209 --> 01:35:13.929]  No, it's a joke.
[01:35:15.663 --> 01:35:20.986]  Because it shows videos when I got to my biggest, and it's meant to be a catchy headline.
[01:35:20.986 --> 01:35:26.349]  And it's got some of the testimonials right there on the site, some of the feedback from people.
[01:35:26.349 --> 01:35:30.992]  But Super Mill Vitality is no joke, and it ends up funding our operation as well.
[01:35:30.992 --> 01:35:42.318]  Tip of the spear promoting freedom, free internet, free speech, religious freedom, health freedom, Second Amendment freedom, national sovereignty, supporting women to be women, men to be men.
[01:35:42.318 --> 01:35:45.020]  If you want to be something else, that's your issue, but don't attack us.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:50.687]  It's all up at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:35:50.687 --> 01:35:56.516]  We'll also add on the front page of InfoWarsLife.com the new video that is titled Alex Jones is a Fat Ass.
[01:35:56.516 --> 01:35:59.120]  So go check that out at InfoWars.com if you want.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.381]  And I still have a little bit of...
[01:36:02.597 --> 01:36:05.659]  Belly fat and a little bit on my face.
[01:36:05.659 --> 01:36:09.822]  But I'm telling you, soaking wet out of the shower, folks, I look like a new person.
[01:36:09.822 --> 01:36:14.966]  And soon I'm gonna take some photos of myself in shorts just to show people the transformation.
[01:36:14.966 --> 01:36:16.928]  Then I got family photos of me about five years ago.
[01:36:17.668 --> 01:36:17.948]  That's right.
[01:36:35.575 --> 01:36:38.918]  And it was all not having the proper supplements.
[01:36:38.918 --> 01:36:44.622]  So the Longevity products and Infowarshealth.com brought me a long way and they're a big part of it.
[01:36:44.622 --> 01:36:48.005]  But the Infowars Life products are really bringing me the rest of the way.
[01:36:48.005 --> 01:36:49.386]  I mean, I still work till 2 a.m.
[01:36:49.386 --> 01:36:49.927]  some mornings.
[01:36:49.927 --> 01:36:51.088]  I still go out and do stuff.
[01:36:51.088 --> 01:36:54.310]  I still fly to places and don't sleep.
[01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:58.353]  And this stuff literally is more important to me than coffee now.
[01:36:58.353 --> 01:37:00.015]  We do sell high-quality organic
[01:37:01.474 --> 01:37:04.456]  Shade Grown Volcanic Coffee from Southern Mexico.
[01:37:04.456 --> 01:37:05.696]  The Lake of America Coffee.
[01:37:05.696 --> 01:37:09.178]  It's all on Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:09.178 --> 01:37:09.879]  Super Male.
[01:37:09.879 --> 01:37:11.400]  I take a little more than recommended dose.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.441]  For a while I took half of it because I couldn't handle it.
[01:37:13.441 --> 01:37:15.502]  Now I've gotten where I've got a tolerance.
[01:37:15.502 --> 01:37:18.384]  I take it morning, noon, and night.
[01:37:18.384 --> 01:37:21.285]  And here is my noon dose at 1237 Central.
[01:37:24.619 --> 01:37:28.321]  And then we have the proprietary survival shield nascent iodine.
[01:37:28.321 --> 01:37:30.903]  There's no other iodine like this anywhere.
[01:37:30.903 --> 01:37:34.445]  There will be a new iodine starting next week.
[01:37:34.445 --> 01:37:37.066]  I've got to say, folks, I wouldn't even call it improvement.
[01:37:37.066 --> 01:37:38.007]  It's different.
[01:37:38.007 --> 01:37:39.207]  We're going to break all that down.
[01:37:39.207 --> 01:37:41.229]  But this is simply amazing.
[01:37:41.229 --> 01:37:43.730]  This is what helped my skin get healthier.
[01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:47.072]  I wasn't getting tans.
[01:37:47.072 --> 01:37:48.593]  Even though I'd go out in the sun, I would just burn.
[01:37:49.634 --> 01:37:53.216]  Until I started taking this type of niacin iodine.
[01:37:53.216 --> 01:37:55.917]  And I heard Pharmacist Ben Fuchs talking about it himself.
[01:37:55.917 --> 01:37:59.439]  So when I was looking at the best products to come out with, I did a deep research.
[01:37:59.439 --> 01:38:02.140]  Trying out a bunch of different brands, trying out different systems.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:06.802]  And then I found what Pharmacist Ben Fuchs was about to come out with, and I was like, wow, this is the way to go.
[01:38:06.802 --> 01:38:09.804]  And it turned out a lab had been making it for 20 years, but nobody knew about it.
[01:38:10.655 --> 01:38:16.179]  So, the Survival Shield Nascent Iodine, available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:38:16.179 --> 01:38:19.102]  There's a bunch of other great products, the Lung Cleanse, you name it.
[01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:20.723]  So good for my allergies.
[01:38:20.723 --> 01:38:28.890]  Just try the challenge, you'll find out how real these products are, and then you'll continue to purchase them, and that makes it possible for us to put out this information.
[01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:34.294]  So get revolutionary health products, supplements, while supporting revolutionary media.
[01:38:36.636 --> 01:38:43.679]  And I want to thank you all for being patrons of InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsHealth.com.

[01:38:49.201 --> 01:38:55.784]  Our polite crew of customer service is ready to take your calls until 6 o'clock every night, then it rolls over to the call answering center.
[01:38:55.784 --> 01:38:58.465]  They're great folks as well, but they can't answer all your questions.
[01:38:58.465 --> 01:38:59.306]  They can just take your order.
[01:39:00.230 --> 01:39:00.290]  888-253-3139.
[01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:00.350]  888-253-3139.
[01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:03.375]  And again, it is your purchases, your presentplanet.tv memberships.
[01:39:11.834 --> 01:39:15.276]  When you buy the ProGun t-shirts, whatever the case is, that makes this possible.
[01:39:15.276 --> 01:39:21.421]  We don't take your money from taxpayers like NPR and from the Rockefeller Foundation like MSNBC.
[01:39:21.421 --> 01:39:24.783]  We get it from listeners and viewers like you supporting us.
[01:39:24.783 --> 01:39:30.067]  All right, going back to Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, I'm going to shut up now as much as I can for the balance of the hour.
[01:39:30.067 --> 01:39:41.595]  Get into what's in colostrum, what's in breast milk, and then get into other epigenetics, positive things people can do from your deep research and all the studies you sent me.
[01:39:41.937 --> 01:39:43.918]  Well, we'll talk about the positive things here in a second.
[01:39:43.918 --> 01:39:54.784]  By the way, there's a whole new branch, it's not that new, it's probably about 20 years old, of science called Neutrogenomics, which is the study of the effect of nutrients on the genome.
[01:39:54.784 --> 01:39:57.066]  As it turns out, nutrients are powerful epigenetic factors.
[01:39:57.066 --> 01:40:01.788]  As a matter of fact, most women know that when they're pregnant, they gotta take folic acid to prevent birth defects.
[01:40:01.788 --> 01:40:02.709]  Well, as it turns out,
[01:40:03.349 --> 01:40:03.990]  Folic Acid
[01:40:33.710 --> 01:40:35.991]  The first milk that the baby gets.
[01:40:35.991 --> 01:40:39.514]  And like breast milk, it contains immune regulating substances.
[01:40:39.514 --> 01:40:41.036]  Substances that build the immune system.
[01:40:41.036 --> 01:40:43.938]  Something called PRP, Proline Rich Peptide.
[01:40:43.938 --> 01:40:49.322]  It's a hormone-like substance that stimulates the thymus, which is the body's main immune gland.
[01:40:49.322 --> 01:40:54.427]  This idea of the immune system being built by mother's milk and by colostrum is very important to recognize.
[01:40:54.427 --> 01:40:57.289]  And by the way, when I say the immune system, I mean the digestive system.
[01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:58.009]  I think so.
[01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:24.732]  And their digestive system are not fully mature.
[01:41:24.732 --> 01:41:32.359]  And this is a big problem because toxins get into the body through the digestive tract and the immune system that is suppressed will compromise the baby.
[01:41:32.359 --> 01:41:43.509]  So nature has devised this wonderful system for growing the digestive tract, for supporting the growth of the immune system, for supporting the growth of the digestive tract and supporting the healthy immune system.
[01:41:43.509 --> 01:41:45.851]  And that is what mother's milk and that's what breast milk is.
[01:41:46.311 --> 01:42:02.337]  And that's why when you say what's in breast milk, it's hard to quantify all the different things because there are so many of these growth factors and immune factors and anti-inflammatory factors and transfer factors and antibiotic-like substance, something called lactoferrin, something called transferrin.
[01:42:02.337 --> 01:42:04.878]  These are substances that bind iron.
[01:42:04.878 --> 01:42:06.419]  Iron being very important for bacteria.
[01:42:06.419 --> 01:42:10.220]  But that's just junk that came out of the creature that just made you.
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:10.540]  Right.
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:12.541]  I mean, why would this female have anything
[01:42:12.921 --> 01:42:13.661]  Yeah.
[01:42:13.661 --> 01:42:16.802]  For the creature, it literally just wove in its womb.
[01:42:16.802 --> 01:42:22.843]  I mean, you're a weirdo to think that babies need what came from the place it was just created.
[01:42:22.843 --> 01:42:24.064]  I mean, that's crazy.
[01:42:24.064 --> 01:42:25.484]  Alex, we all need breast milk.
[01:42:25.484 --> 01:42:26.584]  It's not even just babies.
[01:42:26.584 --> 01:42:32.766]  Everybody needs breast milk, but especially developing infants whose cells are dividing rapidly and who can't eat food.
[01:42:33.226 --> 01:42:33.306]  Yeah.
[01:42:48.183 --> 01:42:48.503]  We're good!
[01:43:13.496 --> 01:43:13.656]  I don't
[01:43:31.312 --> 01:43:37.495]  30% of Americans have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, another sort of digestive problem.
[01:43:37.495 --> 01:43:41.037]  How much of this is related to the fact that babies are being born cesarean?
[01:43:41.037 --> 01:43:44.538]  How much of this is related to the fact that babies are not being breastfed?
[01:43:44.538 --> 01:43:55.084]  How much of this is related to the fact that even if mothers are savvy enough to be breastfeeding, they're typically not going to be breastfeeding long enough, or they're nutritionally deficient and their breast milk will be nutritionally deficient?
[01:43:55.084 --> 01:43:55.744]  How much of our
[01:43:56.184 --> 01:43:56.884]  We're good to go!
[01:44:26.132 --> 01:44:26.553]  I think?
[01:44:42.048 --> 01:44:42.208]  That's
[01:45:01.144 --> 01:45:01.524]  I don't know.
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:24.384]  Breast milk is a wonderful source of these vitamin-binding proteins.
[01:45:24.384 --> 01:45:32.551]  Speaking of vitamins, the fatty vitamins, which are so important for health and so important for building tissue, are packed in breast milk, as are all fats.
[01:45:32.551 --> 01:45:36.615]  Breast milk is loaded with fat, probably 60% or so of breast milk is fat.
[01:45:36.615 --> 01:45:37.675]  And by the way, you mentioned how...
[01:45:38.456 --> 01:45:48.142]  We've been just hypnotized with this idea of low-fat this and low-fat that and you've got to watch your fats and you've got to stay away from saturated fats.
[01:45:48.142 --> 01:46:01.770]  Today, savvy nutritionists understand that not only is fat important as a source of energy for the heart and for the brain, but when you eat fat, that allows your body to access and transport fatty vitamins.
[01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:05.933]  Vitamins D, Vitamins E. Well, I even see in mainstream news now, what you and others were saying decades ago,
[01:46:06.753 --> 01:46:10.657]  They're now admitting that so many people have Alzheimer's because they're on these low-fat diets.
[01:46:10.657 --> 01:46:10.998]  That's right.
[01:46:10.998 --> 01:46:16.504]  And you need the coconut oil, all of it, that they got taken out of the popcorn back in the early 90s.
[01:46:16.504 --> 01:46:18.886]  I mean, look, the system knows what they're doing.
[01:46:18.886 --> 01:46:25.574]  And then you put people on statins that on record literally just eat your brain because your brain's made out of cholesterol.
[01:46:25.574 --> 01:46:26.455]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:46:26.895 --> 01:46:34.480]  Alex, the quintessential human biomolecule which separates human beings and animals from plants is cholesterol.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.803]  If you want to be a fern plant, stop making cholesterol.
[01:46:37.803 --> 01:46:41.225]  That's the distinction between a plant which sits in the ground and doesn't move.
[01:46:41.225 --> 01:46:48.290]  Women wonder why their bodies fall apart, why their skin falls apart, and they're putting basically cholesterol creams on their face instead of eating it.
[01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:51.932]  And by the way, one of the most important elements for your skin is cholesterol.
[01:46:51.932 --> 01:46:53.813]  You can't have healthy skin without cholesterol.
[01:46:53.813 --> 01:47:01.556]  Many skin diseases, like eczema and psoriasis, are associated with problems processing cholesterol in the skin.
[01:47:01.556 --> 01:47:06.899]  In fact, one of the best things you could ever do for your skin is eat liver, and eat eggs, and drink milk, and eat cholesterol-containing food.
[01:47:06.899 --> 01:47:15.964]  I was about to say, I've read Michelle Obama's, you know, because she tells us what our kids are supposed to eat in schools, and then what she wants is what they eat, and it's literally present food.
[01:47:16.864 --> 01:47:20.589]  It doesn't ever say GMO is bad, or aspartame is bad, or sugar is bad.
[01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:24.413]  What they say is bad is just any amount of fat, period.
[01:47:24.413 --> 01:47:34.445]  They don't differentiate trans fat, some artificial fat, that they allow us to eat, which probably should be illegal, instead of the good healthy fats.
[01:47:34.445 --> 01:47:35.446]  So what are healthy fats?
[01:47:35.566 --> 01:47:39.089]  Even on the food pyramid, it just says fats and oils.
[01:47:39.089 --> 01:47:42.871]  It doesn't distinguish trans fats, processed fats from all the other kinds of fats.
[01:47:42.871 --> 01:47:44.372]  It's just fats and oils.
[01:47:44.372 --> 01:47:45.533]  What are some of the good fats?
[01:47:45.533 --> 01:47:48.235]  Well, as long as it's not processed, it's probably a good fat.
[01:47:48.235 --> 01:47:49.276]  Saturated fats?
[01:47:49.276 --> 01:47:50.117]  Good fat.
[01:47:50.117 --> 01:47:55.540]  Despite what you may have heard, saturated fats are very important, especially for cardiovascular health and even for brain health.
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:57.282]  Coconut oil fat, palm oil fat.
[01:47:58.002 --> 01:47:58.503]  I'm good.
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:20.346]  Very, very important for blood health and for cardiovascular health, for brain health, for skin diseases like eczema and psoriasis.
[01:48:20.346 --> 01:48:22.348]  Fish oil capsules can be very helpful.
[01:48:22.348 --> 01:48:27.292]  Omega-6 fats, for a long time, nutritionists were telling you, oh, you don't need to eat Omega-6 fats.
[01:48:27.292 --> 01:48:28.893]  Everybody's got enough Omega-6 fats.
[01:48:28.893 --> 01:48:30.995]  Well, as it turns out, that's not true.
[01:48:30.995 --> 01:48:33.757]  We need Omega-6 fats and we need Omega-3 fats.
[01:48:33.757 --> 01:48:36.640]  And here's the thing about fats that people miss, Alex.
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:39.402]  When you eat fat, it helps your body
[01:48:39.742 --> 01:48:44.905]  Transport and Access Fatty Nutrients That Are In Those Fatty Foods!
[01:48:58.973 --> 01:48:59.333]  I'm good.
[01:49:14.949 --> 01:49:18.152]  Beneficial effects on literally every single system in your body.
[01:49:18.152 --> 01:49:22.575]  There's an important distinction, by the way, between watery substances and fatty substances.
[01:49:22.575 --> 01:49:29.520]  Watery materials, like the B vitamins and vitamin C and electrolytes, these are nutritional substances that dissolve in water.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:32.883]  These watery substances are used by the body quickly.
[01:49:32.883 --> 01:49:34.785]  Because they're watery, they go right to work.
[01:49:34.785 --> 01:49:36.146]  They're used for energy.
[01:49:36.146 --> 01:49:38.708]  They give your heart energy, they give your brain energy.
[01:49:38.708 --> 01:49:40.709]  Let me shift gears into another subject.
[01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:43.992]  Why is iodine, because you always say it's so important in epigenetics,
[01:49:44.512 --> 01:49:46.433]  Iodine is crazy, crazy important.
[01:49:46.433 --> 01:49:52.238]  Iodine, well first of all, if you ask your average doctor, your average layperson about iodine, they'll tell you about the thyroid, and that's true.
[01:49:52.238 --> 01:49:57.541]  Iodine is a very important element for the thyroid, but it's way more important than just for the thyroid.
[01:49:57.541 --> 01:50:00.103]  Iodine is a glandular support vitamin.
[01:50:00.103 --> 01:50:08.429]  That means the various glands in the body, the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands and the pancreas and the thymus, these glands secrete
[01:50:08.789 --> 01:50:09.770]  We're good to go!
[01:50:31.423 --> 01:50:36.845]  Iodine is important for the functioning of every single cell in the body.
[01:50:36.845 --> 01:50:38.326]  That makes it vitally important.
[01:50:38.326 --> 01:50:46.810]  And what's scary about iodine is if you're not using your nascent iodine, if you're not supplementing with iodine, it's very difficult to get from food unless you're eating a lot of seafood.
[01:50:46.810 --> 01:50:54.513]  Iodine is basically an ocean mineral, and this is why people who live in the middle part of the country, where they're not getting a lot of seafood, tend to suffer from goiter and other iodine diseases.
[01:50:54.513 --> 01:50:55.693]  And they're so obese.
[01:50:55.693 --> 01:50:56.674]  Absolutely.
[01:50:56.674 --> 01:50:58.114]  The brain is also very obese.
[01:50:58.114 --> 01:50:58.454]  Stay there.
[01:50:58.454 --> 01:50:59.535]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[01:51:00.117 --> 01:51:01.197]  Clean your house!
[01:51:01.197 --> 01:51:02.198]  It's a mess!

[01:54:22.273 --> 01:54:34.202]  Coming up after Pharmacist Ben Fuchs leaves us, Top Obama Aides has many more executive actions to come, including legalizing illegal aliens and restricting the Second Amendment.
[01:54:34.202 --> 01:54:37.784]  A record 10,996.
[01:54:37.784 --> 01:54:42.808]  447 are now on disability in this country.
[01:54:42.808 --> 01:54:45.530]  That story's up at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:48.152]  Stocks tumble amid Fed rate talk.
[01:54:49.192 --> 01:54:49.732]  That's right.
[01:54:49.732 --> 01:54:53.835]  CNBC is reporting stocks decline amid Fed rate talk.
[01:54:53.835 --> 01:54:55.737]  Dow drops 150 points.
[01:54:55.737 --> 01:54:55.897]  U.S.
[01:54:55.897 --> 01:55:07.225]  stocks fell sharply today after two-session rise with the Fed's Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser saying the central bank might have to raise rates sooner than some have expected.
[01:55:07.225 --> 01:55:09.046]  That would signal the end of QE Unlimited.
[01:55:10.506 --> 01:55:13.467]  In a very serious situation, obviously.
[01:55:13.467 --> 01:55:14.607]  Farmers has been fixable with us.
[01:55:14.607 --> 01:55:18.508]  20 minutes to the next hour, we'll get to a bunch of breaking news.
[01:55:18.508 --> 01:55:22.070]  Bunch of articles up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:25.571]  Paul Craig Roberts has a new article out called Militarist Buncombe.
[01:55:25.571 --> 01:55:30.392]  Getting into Obama's claims, he can attack anybody he wants anytime, without even congressional authorization.
[01:55:30.392 --> 01:55:35.274]  There's a new video out, college students are experts on feral.
[01:55:35.274 --> 01:55:35.874]  Who's feral?
[01:55:37.465 --> 01:55:38.467]  That's Pharrell.
[01:55:38.467 --> 01:55:39.209]  Pharrell?
[01:55:39.209 --> 01:55:40.573]  Yeah, Despicable Me.
[01:55:40.573 --> 01:55:41.235]  All the music.
[01:55:41.235 --> 01:55:42.518]  Oh, Despicable Me.
[01:55:42.518 --> 01:55:45.085]  But have no idea what Benghazi is.
[01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:47.750]  Well, see, I don't know what Pharrell is.
[01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:49.051]  I know what Benghazi is.
[01:55:49.051 --> 01:55:52.032]  The plan to kill the internet by Paul Joseph Watson and myself.
[01:55:52.032 --> 01:55:53.232]  You want to know how they're planning to kill it?
[01:55:53.232 --> 01:55:54.033]  You want to try to stop it?
[01:55:54.033 --> 01:55:55.033]  There it is.
[01:55:55.033 --> 01:56:01.335]  Wisconsin police reassure residents they won't be shot at from military trucks they're getting.
[01:56:01.335 --> 01:56:04.716]  Report says 50% of people are conspiracy theorists.
[01:56:04.716 --> 01:56:05.917]  You're probably one of them.
[01:56:05.917 --> 01:56:07.137]  I want to go over that article.
[01:56:07.137 --> 01:56:11.939]  Because it says, do you believe the government wants to suppress alternative medicine?
[01:56:11.939 --> 01:56:15.760]  You're mentally ill and have, you know, opposition to authority disorder.
[01:56:16.445 --> 01:56:18.169]  Do you believe government ever does anything wrong?
[01:56:18.169 --> 01:56:19.050]  You're insane!
[01:56:19.050 --> 01:56:22.818]  Do you believe pigs can fly and that Obama's God?
[01:56:22.818 --> 01:56:23.419]  You're normal!
[01:56:25.501 --> 01:56:30.582]  So that's just some of the news that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:56:30.582 --> 01:56:31.742]  There's a ton more, obviously.
[01:56:31.742 --> 01:56:33.963]  You can check out the new site design.
[01:56:33.963 --> 01:56:35.943]  We're slowly augmenting the site.
[01:56:35.943 --> 01:56:40.364]  It's got a new whole bottom area with new subsections and new articles.
[01:56:40.364 --> 01:56:44.845]  So be sure and scroll down on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[01:56:44.845 --> 01:56:52.286]  Getting back in the three or four minutes we have left here, obviously I'm bringing up iodine because I sell what I believe is the best quality iodine out there, True Nascent.
[01:56:52.286 --> 01:56:54.927]  Turns electric blue on paper, not black.
[01:56:56.465 --> 01:57:04.952]  And that's because, from what we looked at, it's not bound and literally goes right into the bloodstream from what Dr. Group and others have said.
[01:57:04.952 --> 01:57:11.277]  And we've also been tweaking with it and doing tests with an even more supercharged type, but that'll be announced soon.
[01:57:11.277 --> 01:57:14.379]  But, I mean, look, I was looking at what to use.
[01:57:14.379 --> 01:57:19.443]  I used this for three or four months before I decided to roll out with it and mass produce it.
[01:57:19.443 --> 01:57:20.564]  Life-changing!
[01:57:20.564 --> 01:57:23.106]  The clarity, the mental clarity, my skin,
[01:57:25.012 --> 01:57:30.615]  I'm able to get a really good chestnut tan now with a lot less sun and I don't burn.
[01:57:30.615 --> 01:57:32.877]  What's going on with the iodine in a minute and a half?
[01:57:33.533 --> 01:57:35.774]  Iodine is extremely important for brain health.
[01:57:35.774 --> 01:57:41.815]  In fact, one of the leading causes of mental retardation around the world in babies and children is iodine deficiency.
[01:57:41.815 --> 01:57:47.097]  As I was saying earlier, in landlocked countries, countries that don't have access to seafood, iodine deficiency is somewhat common.
[01:57:47.097 --> 01:57:56.920]  And by the way, one of the best ways for women to protect themselves from breast cancer, which now affects one out of every eight women, aside from breastfeeding, breastfeeding is a great way to protect yourself from breast cancer.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.141]  That's right.
[01:58:18.198 --> 01:58:25.100]  Uh, issues with breast diseases of any kind, to reduce issues with menstrual cramps and PMS for the female reproductive system.
[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:27.001]  We know what a big problem endometriosis is.
[01:58:27.001 --> 01:58:28.521]  You go to a doctor for endometriosis.
[01:58:28.521 --> 01:58:29.701]  It's so elementary!
[01:58:29.701 --> 01:58:32.282]  We don't have breast milk, we don't have iodine.
[01:58:32.282 --> 01:58:34.183]  I mean, they're just targeting us at every level.
[01:58:34.183 --> 01:58:36.263]  They take out iodine, they add bromine.
[01:58:36.263 --> 01:58:37.343]  I mean, it's a conspiracy.
[01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:38.584]  Let's come back and talk about it.
[01:58:38.584 --> 01:58:41.725]  We're an hour coming up from Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, folks.
[01:58:41.725 --> 01:58:44.285]  Check out his website, RightSideBen.com.
[01:58:44.285 --> 01:58:45.526]  PharmacistBen.com.
[01:58:45.526 --> 01:58:46.526]  Alright, stay with us.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:57.168]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:58:57.168 --> 01:58:59.510]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:58:59.510 --> 01:59:04.796]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:59:04.796 --> 01:59:09.741]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:59:09.961 --> 01:59:13.282]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:59:13.282 --> 01:59:17.343]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:59:17.343 --> 01:59:21.664]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:59:21.664 --> 01:59:31.887]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:59:31.887 --> 01:59:34.408]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:59:34.808 --> 01:59:37.130]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.847 --> 02:00:09.670]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.670 --> 02:00:11.271]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.271 --> 02:00:12.811]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.811 --> 02:00:17.014]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.014 --> 02:00:21.116]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.179 --> 02:00:32.641]  Again, it is May 20th, 2014 on this Tuesday edition.
[02:00:32.641 --> 02:00:37.103]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is with us another 20 minutes or so.
[02:00:37.103 --> 02:00:38.824]  There's so much going on in health news.
[02:00:38.824 --> 02:00:43.307]  I've got so many questions, but I notice they stopped spraying iodine mixed with...
[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:45.900]  I don't think so.
[02:01:04.218 --> 02:01:06.820]  Who is making all these decisions, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs?
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:08.261]  What do you think is going on?
[02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:13.145]  I mean, clearly it is a program to make us absolutely dumber than a box of rocks.
[02:01:13.145 --> 02:01:14.246]  And it's working, too.
[02:01:14.246 --> 02:01:17.449]  I mean, look what's happening around the world.
[02:01:17.449 --> 02:01:31.580]  Why are people accepting poisoning of the air through chemtrails, poisoning of the water with antibiotics and drugs, poisoning everywhere, poisoning the food we eat with pesticides and poisoning the very genetics of the food we're eating with GMO crops?
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:32.561]  Why do we accept this?
[02:01:33.061 --> 02:01:38.086]  How does this even become something that we don't question?
[02:01:38.086 --> 02:01:51.839]  It's because we have been dumbified and made docile and mollified through fluoride in the water, through prescription drugs, through television, and through subliminal programming for the last hundred years, maybe even more, Alex.
[02:01:51.839 --> 02:01:53.821]  And it's time we wake up.
[02:01:54.201 --> 02:02:00.425]  And this is the beautiful thing about what you're doing is and what people like you are doing is we're waking people up.
[02:02:00.425 --> 02:02:10.010]  We're helping people understand that the ones who are making the decisions for us are government people, medical people, health care professionals who are making these kinds of decisions don't have
[02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:12.632]  Our interest in mind.
[02:02:12.632 --> 02:02:14.674]  The first step is to wake up to this.
[02:02:14.674 --> 02:02:17.256]  The second step is to start to take control.
[02:02:17.256 --> 02:02:34.130]  We can no longer participate in the medical model, in doing what the doctor says, in going and driving through McDonald's and Taco Bell and participating in eating the corporate swill, in taking prescription drugs and even worse, submitting our children to prescription drug poisonings.
[02:02:34.130 --> 02:02:39.254]  We absolutely have to take the ball and put it back into our own court by eating correct food.
[02:02:39.614 --> 02:03:00.989]  By eating less food, by making sure you're getting on a good nutritional supplement program, by using the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, by using the nascent iodine, by listening to InfoWars, by participating and gathering information for your own, being a researcher yourself, understanding that this new world order that we're living in, this globalist culture that we're living in, does not
[02:03:01.309 --> 02:03:05.753]  Have the individual's benefits in mind.
[02:03:05.753 --> 02:03:11.779]  The New World Order, the corporatocracy, the global government is not about the individual.
[02:03:11.779 --> 02:03:15.242]  The individual has to be about the individual.
[02:03:15.242 --> 02:03:17.364]  And that means we have to do things ourselves.
[02:03:18.004 --> 02:03:19.045]  I believe we can.
[02:03:19.045 --> 02:03:24.610]  I believe, just like you do, Alex, that there is a greatness inherent in being a human being.
[02:03:24.610 --> 02:03:26.712]  This greatness is expressed through our genetics.
[02:03:26.712 --> 02:03:28.734]  This greatness is expressed through our cells.
[02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:31.176]  This greatness is expressed through our immune system.
[02:03:31.176 --> 02:03:37.362]  This greatness is expressed through our body's ability to heal and regenerate itself on a moment-to-moment basis.
[02:03:37.362 --> 02:03:39.444]  What we have to begin to do is acknowledge
[02:03:39.744 --> 02:03:40.104]  Well said.
[02:03:40.104 --> 02:03:44.266]  We're going to go to break and come back in one final long segment with you and I thought
[02:04:08.206 --> 02:04:14.692]  Maybe we should open the phones up right now for specific questions.
[02:04:14.692 --> 02:04:20.997]  Supplement questions, pharmacy questions, breastfeeding questions, iodine questions for you.
[02:04:20.997 --> 02:04:22.138]  You want to take a few calls?
[02:04:22.138 --> 02:04:23.159]  I'd love to.
[02:04:23.159 --> 02:04:25.100]  Alright folks, for Ben Fuchs.
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:26.602]  Questions, quick question, quick answer.
[02:04:28.797 --> 02:04:31.699]  He's only with us for one more segment so we'll get right to you.
[02:04:31.699 --> 02:04:31.759]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:31.759 --> 02:04:34.181]  Your questions for pharmacist Ben Fuchs and I'll also get his take on Obamacare.
[02:04:44.167 --> 02:04:45.268]  People call it a train wreck.
[02:04:45.268 --> 02:04:48.370]  It's designed to wreck the economy and bring in eugenics control.
[02:04:48.370 --> 02:04:49.911]  We'll get his brief take on that as well.
[02:04:49.911 --> 02:04:49.991]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:49.991 --> 02:04:51.531]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:51.531 --> 02:04:53.993]  Our news sites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:05:00.029 --> 02:05:01.090]  I don't know what it is.
[02:05:01.090 --> 02:05:02.971]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[02:05:02.971 --> 02:05:07.094]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[02:05:07.094 --> 02:05:08.695]  It's like I don't even exist.
[02:05:08.695 --> 02:05:10.657]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[02:05:10.657 --> 02:05:12.018]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:05:12.018 --> 02:05:14.740]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:20.164]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[02:05:20.164 --> 02:05:25.228]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[02:05:25.228 --> 02:05:27.930]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[02:05:27.930 --> 02:05:28.370]  Look it up.
[02:05:28.590 --> 02:05:35.475]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.
[02:05:35.475 --> 02:05:40.739]  Energize the man in your life with Super Male Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:40.739 --> 02:05:44.462]  It's designed to aid the body in ways that help invigorate your natural systems.

[02:05:59.947 --> 02:06:06.092]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:06:06.092 --> 02:06:09.415]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:06:09.415 --> 02:06:11.177]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[02:06:11.177 --> 02:06:17.522]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:17.522 --> 02:06:23.427]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[02:06:23.567 --> 02:06:27.529]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:06:27.529 --> 02:06:30.451]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:06:30.451 --> 02:06:38.876]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:06:38.876 --> 02:06:40.977]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:06:40.977 --> 02:06:42.018]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:06:42.378 --> 02:06:51.347]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[02:06:51.347 --> 02:06:53.990]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[02:06:59.892 --> 02:07:02.954]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:02.954 --> 02:07:05.116]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[02:07:05.116 --> 02:07:11.280]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:16.383]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[02:07:16.383 --> 02:07:21.267]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[02:07:21.267 --> 02:07:25.770]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:34.672]  The InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:07:34.672 --> 02:07:36.813]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[02:07:36.813 --> 02:07:47.996]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[02:07:47.996 --> 02:07:55.418]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.
[02:07:55.658 --> 02:07:58.840]  And find other amazing supplements at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:18.192]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.192 --> 02:08:21.174]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to go over an article at Infowars.com
[02:08:24.238 --> 02:08:35.828]  JAMA, one of the big medical journals, says you're insane if you believe cell phones are causing cancer.
[02:08:35.828 --> 02:08:36.828]  I'm not kidding.
[02:08:36.828 --> 02:08:39.991]  And that the government is refusing to act.
[02:08:39.991 --> 02:08:42.653]  GMOs are being used for population control.
[02:08:42.653 --> 02:08:44.495]  The government suppresses alternative medicine.
[02:08:44.495 --> 02:08:47.037]  Vaccinations cause autism.
[02:08:47.037 --> 02:08:50.600]  HIV was intentionally being sent to African communities.
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:51.641]  In Africa.
[02:08:51.641 --> 02:08:53.022]  All of those are true on record.
[02:08:54.249 --> 02:08:56.950]  And by the way, to illustrate that, I'm going to cover it more in the next segment.
[02:08:56.950 --> 02:09:00.392]  Here is AP.
[02:09:00.392 --> 02:09:06.535]  The chemicals chosen for bisphenol A, the plastic formula, is one of the few that actually has estrogen mammakers.
[02:09:06.535 --> 02:09:08.416]  It's done on purpose.
[02:09:08.416 --> 02:09:09.797]  The glyphosate was chosen.
[02:09:09.797 --> 02:09:13.058]  It causes absolute reproductive problems in women.
[02:09:13.058 --> 02:09:14.019]  On record, that's not debated.
[02:09:14.019 --> 02:09:18.061]  We're going to talk to pharmacists and take your calls about that.
[02:09:18.061 --> 02:09:22.163]  But the printer ink universally has the chemicals in it.
[02:09:24.178 --> 02:09:26.840]  The plastic leaching, the everything.
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:29.021]  This is AP.
[02:09:29.021 --> 02:09:32.944]  But remember doctors, there's no population control.
[02:09:32.944 --> 02:09:43.510]  The chemical that's added to it, how do you pronounce that again?
[02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:48.514]  Minnesota bans antibacterial chemical from soaps.
[02:09:48.514 --> 02:09:51.836]  Minnesota bans antibacterial chemicals from soaps.
[02:09:56.263 --> 02:09:58.404]  Trickle of sand.
[02:09:58.404 --> 02:10:05.728]  Minnesota bans common anti-bacterial chemical from soaps as pressure on industry grows.
[02:10:05.728 --> 02:10:06.369]  Trickle of sand.
[02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:14.833]  And it says it's in 70 plus percent of the, quote, antibacterials and soaps, period.
[02:10:14.833 --> 02:10:15.813]  And guess what?
[02:10:15.813 --> 02:10:18.854]  Triclosan is used and estimated at 75 percent.
[02:10:18.854 --> 02:10:24.376]  But now the Food and Drug Administration has said that it needs to be removed because guess what?
[02:10:24.376 --> 02:10:30.878]  It mimics and disrupts hormones critical, reading from the AP, for reproduction and development.
[02:10:32.159 --> 02:10:39.083]  At least in lab animal tests, and contribute to the development of resistant bacteria.
[02:10:39.083 --> 02:10:42.085]  And again, that shows the government's not pure evil.
[02:10:42.085 --> 02:10:58.074]  The FDA's own scientist in 2001, and then again in 2010, almost unanimously, thousands of toxicologists, scientists, medical doctors, sent briefs in saying, take hydrofluorosilicic acid out of the water.
[02:10:58.074 --> 02:11:00.616]  It's brain damaging, it doesn't help the teeth, it's horrible.
[02:11:02.205 --> 02:11:04.487]  Finally, there were lawsuits and they can't use it as a pesticide.
[02:11:04.487 --> 02:11:06.870]  It's supposed to be phased out.
[02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:08.972]  Kills bugs.
[02:11:08.972 --> 02:11:10.474]  The old-fashioned bug killer was that.
[02:11:10.474 --> 02:11:12.956]  I'm going to keep Fuchs to the bottom of the hour if I can do it to take these calls.
[02:11:12.956 --> 02:11:23.908]  The point is, is that here's an illustration of how JAMA, the big journal of medicine, comes out and says, doctors, look out for conspiracy theorists.
[02:11:23.908 --> 02:11:24.489]  How do you tell?
[02:11:25.697 --> 02:11:29.139]  Well, they think GMOs are designed to reduce population.
[02:11:29.139 --> 02:11:35.622]  In all the rat studies, they make them sterile by three generations almost completely.
[02:11:35.622 --> 02:11:39.104]  I mean, they piggyback stuff on all the computers to spy on us.
[02:11:39.104 --> 02:11:42.345]  They're piggybacking in the gene traits and it's come out.
[02:11:42.345 --> 02:11:48.669]  I mean, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institutes, for heaven's sakes, now is one of the biggest groups in Germany with GMOs under a new name.
[02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:53.991]  Cold Springs Harbor didn't even change the name of the worldwide command base of eugenics.
[02:11:53.991 --> 02:11:55.212]  They're the ones behind all of this.
[02:11:56.368 --> 02:11:57.891]  The fertility's dropping.
[02:11:57.891 --> 02:12:01.136]  The third world fertility didn't drop until 15 years ago.
[02:12:01.136 --> 02:12:03.299]  They started adopting all these chemicals.
[02:12:03.299 --> 02:12:04.741]  And you can say, well, there's too many people.
[02:12:04.741 --> 02:12:05.883]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:12:05.883 --> 02:12:08.668]  Let's just be honest about what's going on here is my point.
[02:12:10.598 --> 02:12:14.179]  Let's stop being dishonest about what's happening and what's going on.
[02:12:14.179 --> 02:12:33.725]  We're being manipulated in a petri dish, scientifically, and the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, currently serving, wrote a book the year I was born, 40 years ago, with other eugenicists, Paul Ehrlich and his wife, Ann Ehrlich, calling for world government, calling for forced sterilization, calling for chemicals to be put in the water.
[02:12:33.725 --> 02:12:33.985]  Okay?
[02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:35.941]  The pharmacist has been fixed.
[02:12:35.941 --> 02:12:41.745]  I want to go to phone calls and quick questions for you, but there's an illustration right there of how JAMA...
[02:12:42.884 --> 02:12:47.707]  is coming out saying, look out for people that think, quote, cell phones are causing cancer.
[02:12:47.707 --> 02:12:53.890]  The London Guardian came out with a major British study last week and said undoubtedly it's causing brain cancer.
[02:12:53.890 --> 02:12:55.311]  It's a microwave system.
[02:12:55.311 --> 02:12:57.773]  I mean, GMOs are being used for population control.
[02:12:57.773 --> 02:12:58.493]  Of course they are.
[02:12:58.493 --> 02:13:00.534]  Government's suppressing alternative medicine.
[02:13:00.534 --> 02:13:01.115]  Of course they are.
[02:13:01.115 --> 02:13:02.395]  What do you think the FDA does?
[02:13:02.395 --> 02:13:04.336]  Vaccinations are causing autism.
[02:13:04.336 --> 02:13:06.177]  They're on record linked to it.
[02:13:06.177 --> 02:13:09.399]  HIV intentionally being sent to African Americans in Africa.
[02:13:09.399 --> 02:13:11.621]  I mean, they shot black people up with syphilis.
[02:13:12.694 --> 02:13:13.814]  What do you say to this?
[02:13:13.814 --> 02:13:16.335]  It's not, what I say to it is it's not a theory.
[02:13:16.335 --> 02:13:20.556]  And it's definitely a conspiracy because it's multiple people.
[02:13:20.556 --> 02:13:23.677]  By definition, it's a conspiracy and it's not theoretical.
[02:13:23.677 --> 02:13:30.959]  The fact of the matter is, is that government has an interest in maintaining itself, like all organizations do.
[02:13:30.959 --> 02:13:35.280]  There's an antagonistic relationship between the government and the individual.
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:37.681]  You and I are individuals.
[02:13:37.681 --> 02:13:44.485]  That means, by nature, there is going to be an antagonistic relationship between the governed and the governed.
[02:13:44.485 --> 02:13:46.145]  Between government and the governed.
[02:13:46.145 --> 02:13:49.027]  And that's unfortunate, and it's not a theory, no matter what JAMA says.
[02:13:49.027 --> 02:14:03.034]  And how the heck can they dispute the fact that electronics, like a cell phone, will tweak the genome and manipulate the cell, which at the end of the day is a bioelectrical system?
[02:14:03.034 --> 02:14:03.775]  How can it be avoided?
[02:14:07.233 --> 02:14:11.776]  But, I mean, they knew 30 years ago when they did cell phone studies that it was giving rats cancer.
[02:14:11.776 --> 02:14:12.437]  Of course.
[02:14:12.437 --> 02:14:15.619]  It vibrates the DNA at point-blank range into your brain.
[02:14:15.619 --> 02:14:18.461]  The contract says don't hold the phones up to your head.
[02:14:18.461 --> 02:14:19.661]  DNA is electrical.
[02:14:19.661 --> 02:14:21.483]  DNA emits electrical energy.
[02:14:21.483 --> 02:14:24.465]  DNA is a radio frequency transmitter.
[02:14:24.465 --> 02:14:25.846]  DNA emits light.
[02:14:25.846 --> 02:14:28.067]  DNA emits something called biophotons.
[02:14:28.067 --> 02:14:29.188]  I'm not making this up.
[02:14:29.188 --> 02:14:30.369]  Go on Google and look it up.
[02:14:30.369 --> 02:14:31.970]  No, no, that's how jellyfish go in the dark.
[02:14:32.898 --> 02:14:35.521]  Bioluminescence and your DNA is the same thing.
[02:14:35.521 --> 02:14:41.149]  So, of course, if you have an electrical system, you can interfere with it with another electrical system.
[02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:42.410]  That's not rocket science.
[02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:45.394]  I mean, literally, it's a microwave relay system.
[02:14:45.394 --> 02:14:48.238]  You put it right up to your head and they get the brain tumor right on the side.
[02:14:48.706 --> 02:14:50.627]  And what do you think happens when you put it next to a cell?
[02:14:50.627 --> 02:14:52.188]  Of course you're going to create changes.
[02:14:52.188 --> 02:14:54.210]  Epigenetic changes, by the way.
[02:14:54.210 --> 02:15:05.257]  And all the changes that we're talking about in a cell that occur with fluoride, that occur with BPA and estrogen mimickers, these are, by definition, epigenetic modifications.
[02:15:05.257 --> 02:15:10.380]  The gene, this is so important, Alex, the gene is responsive to the environment.
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:12.221]  The gene listens to the environment.
[02:15:12.281 --> 02:15:16.944]  No, you just have a gene to get a brain tumor on the side of your head where you use the phone.
[02:15:16.944 --> 02:15:18.965]  You deserve to get it because you had bad genes.
[02:15:18.965 --> 02:15:21.667]  No, your genes save you put a microwave oven.
[02:15:21.667 --> 02:15:26.570]  But don't worry, the Leningradians said it's only for those that use it 15 hours a week.
[02:15:26.570 --> 02:15:32.334]  I see people with their kids everywhere holding them up to their heads and they literally tell me I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[02:15:32.334 --> 02:15:40.359]  How come with the trillions of dollars in the last 50 years that we spent on this war on cancer, cancer rates are just as high if not higher as they were 40 years ago?
[02:15:41.650 --> 02:15:42.471]  Well, they're a lot higher.
[02:15:42.471 --> 02:15:47.480]  I've seen a seven-fold increase in women's lung cancer.
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:50.805]  That was a really strange report I saw on ABC News last year.
[02:15:50.805 --> 02:15:52.347]  It seems like women are getting hit harder.
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:57.782]  Well, women have more fat in their bodies and toxins tend to accumulate in fat.
[02:15:57.782 --> 02:16:03.405]  Women are also producing more estrogen and estrogen tends to be a hormone that's associated with the stress response.
[02:16:03.405 --> 02:16:15.711]  So between estrogen and body fat, women are much more, and dealing with men for that matter, women are much more predisposed to diseases like cancer and autoimmune diseases than men are.
[02:16:15.711 --> 02:16:17.132]  Listen to you kissing up to the women.
[02:16:19.258 --> 02:16:20.859]  Oh my goodness.
[02:16:20.859 --> 02:16:21.360]  Oh boy.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:22.681]  We have to put up with them though, too.
[02:16:22.681 --> 02:16:25.904]  I mean, come on.
[02:16:25.904 --> 02:16:28.186]  Alright, let's go to some phone calls here.
[02:16:28.186 --> 02:16:29.267]  But you heard it!
[02:16:29.267 --> 02:16:30.588]  I just showed you the London Guardian.
[02:16:30.588 --> 02:16:32.549]  Let's put that back up on screen.
[02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:33.150]  But JAMA...
[02:16:37.170 --> 02:16:40.492]  Again, that's the Journal of the American Medical Association.
[02:16:40.492 --> 02:16:44.334]  Intensive mobile phone users at higher risk of brain cancer.
[02:16:44.334 --> 02:16:46.475]  Study says one of thousands.
[02:16:46.475 --> 02:16:49.957]  But don't worry, it's only 15 hours each month.
[02:16:49.957 --> 02:16:54.720]  Almost everybody I know is on the cell phone 15 hours a month.
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:17:05.026]  They literally give us devices to hard boil our brains, and then they have JAMA making fun of us, telling their doctors, you know, look out if your patient talks like this.
[02:17:06.124 --> 02:17:08.185]  This is crazy, isn't it, Fuchs?
[02:17:08.185 --> 02:17:10.086]  Conspiracy theorist.
[02:17:10.086 --> 02:17:12.808]  It's not a theory, that's all I have to say.
[02:17:12.808 --> 02:17:14.929]  Whatever, they said it's not real.
[02:17:14.929 --> 02:17:16.910]  There are no brain tumors, be quiet.
[02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:19.851]  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[02:17:19.851 --> 02:17:24.654]  Scott in Minnesota, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:17:24.654 --> 02:17:27.755]  Michigan, go ahead.
[02:17:27.755 --> 02:17:29.536]  That was an exciting phone call.
[02:17:29.536 --> 02:17:32.698]  Let's talk to Danny in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:35.071]  Hey Alex, how's it going today?
[02:17:35.071 --> 02:17:35.611]  Pretty good, brother.
[02:17:35.611 --> 02:17:36.992]  What's on your mind?
[02:17:36.992 --> 02:17:38.573]  I just had a question for Ben.
[02:17:38.573 --> 02:17:40.554]  I've got a 17-year-old son.
[02:17:40.554 --> 02:17:56.581]  He's got, um, he's a big kid, but he goes through mood swings, and I was just wanting to know if there was any kind of supplement out there that I could get him to kind of even out his, uh, his mood swings, because I'm, like y'all, I'm big anti-pharmaceutical.
[02:17:56.581 --> 02:17:58.963]  I don't want him on any kind of prescription.
[02:17:58.963 --> 02:18:01.324]  I would say, uh, how much exercise is he getting?
[02:18:03.145 --> 02:18:05.767]  Well, Alex, he's very big into sports.
[02:18:05.767 --> 02:18:08.349]  He plays three sports in schools.
[02:18:08.349 --> 02:18:12.552]  I mean, he's a very active kid.
[02:18:12.552 --> 02:18:18.337]  Activity sometimes can be a problem, because activity, especially if he's athletic, he's burning through protein.
[02:18:18.337 --> 02:18:23.941]  When kids are burning through protein, if they don't have access to a steady stream of protein, they're going to eat a lot of sugar.
[02:18:23.941 --> 02:18:26.724]  And by sugar, I mean bread and pasta.
[02:18:26.724 --> 02:18:28.085]  That messes with the dopamine, right?
[02:18:28.305 --> 02:18:30.666]  Alex, the only supplement I've got him on right now is the whey protein that you advertised.
[02:18:55.011 --> 02:18:56.793]  Yeah, milk protein's good.
[02:18:56.793 --> 02:18:58.774]  Pharmacist Fuchs, you're the expert.
[02:18:58.774 --> 02:19:04.719]  Iodine, B vitamins, essential fatty acids, the mighty 90 essential nutrients, and more protein.
[02:19:04.719 --> 02:19:06.361]  That's the remedy, that's the way I would handle it.
[02:19:06.361 --> 02:19:22.695]  I would get him beyond tangy tangerine because, at InfoWarsHealth.com, because, you know, if he's that active, it's either the problem is they're too active or they're not active, is what I've experienced, and he might be deficient in something, and then that can be linked to it, correct, pharmacist?
[02:19:23.137 --> 02:19:24.578]  That's exactly right.
[02:19:24.578 --> 02:19:33.584]  When kids are athletic, they're burning through protein, and the tendency when you're burning through protein is to start to snack on things, and that's a big problem when it comes to bipolar issues or anxiety or depression.
[02:19:33.584 --> 02:19:34.064]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:19:34.064 --> 02:19:34.304]  No, no, no.
[02:19:34.304 --> 02:19:37.667]  That's why I'm so fat is I used to be a big jocks, but I ate whatever I wanted.
[02:19:37.667 --> 02:19:38.867]  Right.
[02:19:38.867 --> 02:19:41.809]  You're burning through protein, and then you were snacking on foods to get energy.
[02:19:41.809 --> 02:19:45.071]  And then I quit working out and turned into the job of the hut.
[02:19:45.071 --> 02:19:48.834]  Caller, I hope that answers your question, but, I mean, again, I would just try different things.
[02:19:48.834 --> 02:19:49.534]  Thank you so much.

[02:23:01.835 --> 02:23:04.596]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:23:04.596 --> 02:23:07.337]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:23:28.744 --> 02:23:31.466]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:23:31.466 --> 02:23:35.770]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:23:35.770 --> 02:23:37.171]  SilverLungs.com.
[02:23:37.171 --> 02:23:39.833]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:23:39.833 --> 02:23:42.836]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:23:42.836 --> 02:23:45.197]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[02:23:45.197 --> 02:23:47.099]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:23:47.099 --> 02:23:52.663]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:23:52.663 --> 02:23:56.467]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[02:23:56.467 --> 02:23:57.968]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[02:23:59.949 --> 02:24:04.172]  Come with me, into the trees.
[02:24:04.172 --> 02:24:09.575]  We lay on the grass and let hours pass.
[02:24:09.575 --> 02:24:14.157]  Take my hand, come back to the land.
[02:24:14.157 --> 02:24:18.960]  Let's get away, just for one day.
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:21.762]  Let me see you stripped.
[02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:35.765]  Let me see you stripped.
[02:24:35.765 --> 02:24:40.288]  The globalists want to strip you of your humanity.
[02:24:40.288 --> 02:24:45.132]  Let me hear your opinions that you didn't get from television.
[02:24:45.132 --> 02:24:51.276]  Let me hear you speak just for me.
[02:24:51.276 --> 02:24:52.417]  Love this part of the song, crank it up.
[02:25:08.139 --> 02:25:19.744]  All right, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our guest.
[02:25:19.744 --> 02:25:21.565]  Really appreciate his time with us.
[02:25:21.565 --> 02:25:24.847]  So Rammstein bringing us in.
[02:25:24.847 --> 02:25:26.547]  Forgotten how good their music is, at least to me.
[02:25:26.547 --> 02:25:28.408]  It might sound like torture to some of you.
[02:25:28.408 --> 02:25:33.130]  Let's go ahead and talk to New Jersey, from New Jersey, here on the air.
[02:25:33.130 --> 02:25:34.311]  You got your question for Ben.
[02:25:34.311 --> 02:25:34.651]  Go ahead.
[02:25:35.319 --> 02:25:35.980]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:37.321]  It is so good to talk to you again.
[02:25:37.321 --> 02:25:41.425]  We met on September 11th of 2007, and it's been a very long time.
[02:25:41.425 --> 02:25:43.728]  So God bless you and your family.
[02:25:43.728 --> 02:25:46.651]  Ben, my wife, we just found out she's pregnant.
[02:25:46.651 --> 02:25:48.032]  We cannot be more excited.
[02:25:48.032 --> 02:25:49.414]  She's five weeks.
[02:25:49.414 --> 02:25:54.419]  We already eat extremely healthy, as much farm-to-table as possible, as much organic as possible.
[02:25:54.932 --> 02:26:04.035]  And just curious if there's a website or a book that I should get to read more about these epigenetics and just better food sources and what she should be taking if that's in the folic acid she's already on.
[02:26:04.035 --> 02:26:06.156]  Get Dr. Wallach's new book, Epigenetics.
[02:26:06.156 --> 02:26:11.098]  My recommendation, in my opinion, it's one of the best books on epigenetics and the easiest ones to read.
[02:26:11.098 --> 02:26:15.779]  Because he was a top zoologist and kept noticing why the animals were dying in the zoos.
[02:26:15.779 --> 02:26:17.260]  They weren't getting the trace minerals, but go ahead.
[02:26:17.694 --> 02:26:26.278]  There's another one called DNA Pirates of the Sacred Spiral by a guy named Len Horowitz, who's really, really quite elegant about the idea of manipulation of the genome.
[02:26:26.278 --> 02:26:27.999]  Those are two good books that I'd recommend.
[02:26:27.999 --> 02:26:39.986]  For babies, for moms who are pregnant, who are building a baby, protein is the key building substance, and it's the one macronutrient that seems to be deficient in most of our diets.
[02:26:39.986 --> 02:26:44.808]  Making sure that the mom is on whey protein is a great idea, also egg protein.
[02:26:44.808 --> 02:26:46.109]  These are building proteins.
[02:26:46.869 --> 02:26:47.310]  I think?
[02:27:02.724 --> 02:27:03.145]  That's right.
[02:27:03.145 --> 02:27:04.106]  Grains contain natural opiates.
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:22.140]  That's
[02:27:43.086 --> 02:27:45.207]  What about where they say you can get too much folic acid?
[02:27:45.207 --> 02:27:46.548]  You can't from a natural source like spinach, right?
[02:28:05.563 --> 02:28:07.585]  Well, there's different kinds of folic acid.
[02:28:07.585 --> 02:28:10.707]  There's the synthetic kind of folic acid and there's the natural kind of folic acid.
[02:28:10.707 --> 02:28:14.170]  Certainly the natural folic acid is better than the synthetic kind.
[02:28:14.170 --> 02:28:16.872]  I don't know about taking too much folic acid because it's water-soluble.
[02:28:16.872 --> 02:28:17.753]  You'll probably excrete it.
[02:28:17.753 --> 02:28:23.117]  But what you want to do is when you're taking your folic acid, you want to take it with the entire B-complex.
[02:28:23.117 --> 02:28:27.521]  Last but not least, omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids are all very important.
[02:28:27.521 --> 02:28:34.327]  Using an essential fatty acid supplement, making sure you're eating fish, which has a reputation for being brain food for the fetus, is very important.
[02:28:34.947 --> 02:28:36.849]  And then coconut oil and some of the saturated fats.
[02:28:36.849 --> 02:28:40.051]  Yeah, I love to eat fish at night because I have great dreams when I eat it.
[02:28:40.051 --> 02:28:41.392]  It's important for the brain, absolutely.
[02:28:41.392 --> 02:28:46.055]  Choline, lecithin... No, I mean, why is fish... fish is almost like a hallucinogen.
[02:28:46.055 --> 02:28:47.076]  It's amazing.
[02:28:47.076 --> 02:28:49.278]  It contains two very important elements for the brain.
[02:28:49.278 --> 02:28:50.659]  Actually, three important elements for the brain.
[02:28:50.659 --> 02:28:58.465]  It's got iodine, it's got omega-3 derivatives, and it's got something called choline, C-H-O-L-I-N-E, which is also a very important epigenetic factor.
[02:28:58.465 --> 02:29:04.189]  As it turns out, for the mom-to-be, for the questioner, using choline supplements can also be very important for the
[02:29:04.269 --> 02:29:06.110]  Alright caller, I hope that answers your question.
[02:29:06.110 --> 02:29:08.150]  You know what, Ben, if you gotta go, you gotta go.
[02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:09.891]  Can you come back and talk to three more callers?
[02:29:09.891 --> 02:29:10.411]  Sure!
[02:29:10.411 --> 02:29:11.551]  Alright, you're awesome.
[02:29:11.551 --> 02:29:13.052]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our guest.
[02:29:13.052 --> 02:29:14.172]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:14.172 --> 02:29:18.913]  We can only talk to him about four minutes, because I've got the Satanist audio and video.
[02:29:18.913 --> 02:29:20.734]  I don't even know what to call this that's coming up.
[02:29:21.835 --> 02:29:25.439]  But it illustrates that there's these type of crazy people out there.
[02:29:25.439 --> 02:29:29.743]  But then the Christians that are going after them, they seem pretty weird too.
[02:29:29.743 --> 02:29:31.846]  I guess different strokes for different folks.
[02:29:31.846 --> 02:29:40.195]  But we got the video now from last Friday and Harvard's satanic debacle, lessons from a black mass cancellation.
[02:29:40.195 --> 02:29:42.397]  And you'll get to see and hear the Satanists go crazy.
[02:29:43.471 --> 02:29:48.538]  And it just illustrates these people really do exist, and they're tuned into some really bad energy, folks.
[02:29:48.538 --> 02:29:49.199]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:49.199 --> 02:29:49.599]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.599 --> 02:29:50.921]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.921 --> 02:29:52.503]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.503 --> 02:29:56.609]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network at empireworks.com.
[02:29:56.609 --> 02:29:58.872]  You'll all be able to see it radio listeners.
[02:30:00.359 --> 02:30:04.402]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:30:04.402 --> 02:30:08.765]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:30:08.765 --> 02:30:12.427]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:30:12.427 --> 02:30:15.469]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:30:15.469 --> 02:30:23.034]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:30:23.034 --> 02:30:26.677]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:30:26.897 --> 02:30:31.362]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:30:31.362 --> 02:30:37.349]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:41.393]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:30:41.393 --> 02:30:44.016]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:30:44.016 --> 02:30:45.358]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:30:45.498 --> 02:30:46.899]  It's time to take action.
[02:30:46.899 --> 02:30:48.700]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:03.232]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:31:03.232 --> 02:31:08.375]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:31:08.375 --> 02:31:16.501]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:31:16.501 --> 02:31:21.023]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:31:21.023 --> 02:31:24.846]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:31:24.986 --> 02:31:30.930]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:31:30.930 --> 02:31:34.092]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:31:34.092 --> 02:31:39.496]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:31:39.496 --> 02:31:47.661]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:31:47.661 --> 02:31:47.841]  That's 866-229-0927.
[02:31:57.307 --> 02:32:08.654]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[02:32:08.654 --> 02:32:10.875]  All the major networks are state-run.
[02:32:10.875 --> 02:32:13.577]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[02:32:13.577 --> 02:32:17.939]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[02:32:17.939 --> 02:32:20.981]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[02:32:21.001 --> 02:32:28.629]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:32:28.629 --> 02:32:32.953]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[02:32:32.953 --> 02:32:34.755]  We are the true media.
[02:32:34.755 --> 02:32:37.358]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[02:32:37.418 --> 02:32:41.181]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[02:33:17.336 --> 02:33:22.838]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:22.838 --> 02:33:33.563]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.563 --> 02:33:38.405]  The music's fitting for the Satanists that are coming up.
[02:33:38.405 --> 02:33:44.267]  People that just want to dominate everyone are all about themselves.
[02:33:44.267 --> 02:33:45.288]  The thing is, they're weak.
[02:33:47.037 --> 02:33:50.018]  You really know who they are.
[02:33:50.018 --> 02:33:59.422]  They only thrive in societies that, for some reason, tolerate them.
[02:33:59.422 --> 02:34:00.702]  That's coming up in a few minutes.
[02:34:00.702 --> 02:34:04.204]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our guest.
[02:34:04.204 --> 02:34:06.104]  Let's talk to Barbara in Florida.
[02:34:06.104 --> 02:34:07.985]  You got your questions for Ben?
[02:34:07.985 --> 02:34:08.785]  You've got questions?
[02:34:08.785 --> 02:34:09.826]  I think he's got answers.
[02:34:09.826 --> 02:34:10.206]  Go ahead.
[02:34:11.468 --> 02:34:13.809]  Well, I want to say thank you very much for taking my call.
[02:34:13.809 --> 02:34:14.809]  You're awesome.
[02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:18.911]  And I want to know about thyroiditis.
[02:34:18.911 --> 02:34:22.012]  I have two nodules on my thyroid.
[02:34:22.012 --> 02:34:27.735]  My blood work came back, they say normal, but I would think it's in the higher range of the normal.
[02:34:27.735 --> 02:34:30.156]  And I was taking nascent iodine for the past five months.
[02:34:30.156 --> 02:34:33.497]  I didn't know if that aggravated a condition that I may already have.
[02:34:35.019 --> 02:34:37.601]  And I have a good diet.
[02:34:37.601 --> 02:34:41.063]  I've conquered chronic fatigue and my allergies by changing everything.
[02:34:41.063 --> 02:34:43.505]  So, any suggestions?
[02:34:43.505 --> 02:34:46.367]  Yeah, you're dealing with a residual probably from your chronic fatigue.
[02:34:46.367 --> 02:34:53.232]  There's a very important relationship between the thyroid and your body's stress gland, which is called the adrenal glands.
[02:34:53.232 --> 02:34:55.193]  When the adrenal glands become overworked and they're
[02:34:55.333 --> 02:34:55.573]  Thank you!
[02:35:13.738 --> 02:35:18.420]  I would guess that you had something going on in terms of your diet, in terms of your digestive system.
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:22.762]  That's usually what's involved with thyroid problems.
[02:35:22.762 --> 02:35:27.304]  If you're not taking the iodine, or if you stop taking the iodine, I would get back on it.
[02:35:27.304 --> 02:35:28.785]  Iodine is extremely important for the thyroid.
[02:35:28.785 --> 02:35:32.927]  Well, explain that, because you have to have that, but if you don't have it, the body will use something else, right?
[02:35:33.007 --> 02:35:42.815]  Well, the body will use bromine, or chlorine, and most of us are getting plenty of chlorine through tap water, so if you're not getting iodine, your body will absorb chlorine and bromine more effectively.
[02:35:42.815 --> 02:35:44.176]  In fact, your thyroid will attempt to use it.
[02:35:44.176 --> 02:35:46.178]  Now, what's the detoxing thing that does that?
[02:35:46.178 --> 02:35:47.058]  I was about to say that.
[02:35:47.058 --> 02:35:48.299]  It's very interesting, Alex.
[02:35:48.299 --> 02:36:00.369]  When you start taking iodine, all the bromine and chlorine that have been accumulating in your thyroid, because you didn't have the iodine, will come out in your blood, and you'll start to experience some of the toxicity associated with excess bromine in the blood.
[02:36:00.589 --> 02:36:02.510]  I don't want to get gross here, but he warned me... Diarrhea?
[02:36:02.510 --> 02:36:02.930]  Loose stools?
[02:36:02.930 --> 02:36:04.671]  Well, not even that, but I was warned by Dr. Ed Group.
[02:36:04.671 --> 02:36:05.052]  He said,
[02:36:21.121 --> 02:36:21.301]  Yeah.
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:47.582]  As your body fat was breaking down, as you were losing fat, all the toxins that were stored in the fat, that's one of the things the body will do when it can't handle toxicity, it'll store it in fat.
[02:36:47.582 --> 02:36:58.425]  It'll store it in fat in the gut, it'll store it in fat in the breasts, it'll store it in fat in the glutes, and as you start to lose weight, as you start to lose body fat, all those toxins will end up in your blood, and that's probably what you experience.
[02:36:58.425 --> 02:37:01.526]  Can it be when you take iodine and you have all those toxins in your thyroid, it pumps them out?
[02:37:01.786 --> 02:37:02.667]  Correct.
[02:37:02.667 --> 02:37:09.074]  That's called brominosis and that's one of the things that happen when people start to supplement with a good iodine supplement like the nascent iodine.
[02:37:09.074 --> 02:37:11.177]  But that's not a reason not to use the iodine.
[02:37:11.177 --> 02:37:16.503]  That's a reason to continue using the iodine and make sure that the bromine doesn't reattach to the thyroid.
[02:37:16.783 --> 02:37:18.685]  So I'd be staying on the iodine supplements.
[02:37:18.685 --> 02:37:25.573]  And by the way, there's other nutrients that are very helpful for the thyroid, especially the B vitamins and also vitamin A and also essential fatty acids.
[02:37:25.573 --> 02:37:27.395]  And don't forget about the digestive link.
[02:37:27.395 --> 02:37:36.044]  There's a very, very important digestive connection to thyroid issues, especially Graves' disease and autoimmune disease, Hashimoto's thyroid and other autoimmune diseases of the thyroid.
[02:37:36.044 --> 02:37:37.306]  Ma'am, I hope that answers your question.
[02:37:37.306 --> 02:37:38.267]  Does that answer your question, Barbara?
[02:37:39.452 --> 02:37:44.613]  I would want to know if I should take the nascent iodine again or stop taking it.
[02:37:44.613 --> 02:37:46.693]  Yes, yes, I would.
[02:37:46.693 --> 02:37:47.493]  That's what I would do.
[02:37:47.493 --> 02:37:48.434]  I mean, I'm not telling you what to do.
[02:37:48.434 --> 02:37:55.155]  I mean, maybe she should get it out of salt if she's having an issue with another brand, or maybe she could talk to her physicians.
[02:37:55.155 --> 02:37:56.915]  What I would tell you, I'm not going to give you advice.
[02:37:56.915 --> 02:37:58.916]  I'm just a lay person here.
[02:37:58.916 --> 02:38:01.176]  But, I mean, you need iodine, period.
[02:38:01.176 --> 02:38:02.616]  You need iodine.
[02:38:02.616 --> 02:38:04.357]  Alex and Barbara, these are essential.
[02:38:04.357 --> 02:38:05.977]  We're talking about something that is essential.
[02:38:05.977 --> 02:38:06.817]  It's not optional.
[02:38:06.937 --> 02:38:07.737]  You'll die without it.
[02:38:07.737 --> 02:38:09.338]  You'll die without it, exactly.
[02:38:09.338 --> 02:38:12.239]  This is something that the body cannot make and must have.
[02:38:12.239 --> 02:38:13.739]  That's what it means to be essential.
[02:38:13.739 --> 02:38:19.301]  So if you deprive yourself of supplemental iodine, you better make sure you're eating a lot of fish and not eating a lot of seafood.
[02:38:19.301 --> 02:38:21.302]  That's pretty much the only place where you're going to get the cost of iodine.
[02:38:21.302 --> 02:38:23.363]  Alright, we're almost out of time because I've got to play this piece coming up.
[02:38:23.363 --> 02:38:24.663]  Let's go to Randy in Oklahoma.
[02:38:24.663 --> 02:38:26.304]  Quick question, Randy.
[02:38:26.304 --> 02:38:27.984]  Okay, real quick here.
[02:38:27.984 --> 02:38:28.945]  Way to go, T-Rex.
[02:38:28.945 --> 02:38:29.925]  Keep it up, by the way.
[02:38:30.999 --> 02:38:34.822]  A question on policy and at the time a medical one.
[02:38:34.822 --> 02:38:40.407]  On policy, I'm on the ballot for a House district up here in Oklahoma.
[02:38:40.407 --> 02:38:49.594]  I'd like to get in where we can stop the domination of doctor training and the curriculum in medical schools.
[02:38:49.594 --> 02:38:53.958]  Have you seen any groups that have any good suggestions
[02:38:54.947 --> 02:38:58.690]  You know, for making changes in that, or am I off track on that?
[02:38:58.690 --> 02:39:07.738]  We as individuals have to begin to understand that this deification of the medical model is self-serving and is perpetuated by the medical model itself.
[02:39:07.738 --> 02:39:09.299]  It's not in our interest.
[02:39:09.299 --> 02:39:10.780]  These are not deities.
[02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:13.782]  And there's nothing divine about the medical model.
[02:39:13.782 --> 02:39:16.004]  In fact, it is anti-divine.
[02:39:16.004 --> 02:39:20.548]  And to deify the medical model is only in the interest of the medical model itself.
[02:39:20.548 --> 02:39:21.769]  It's not in the interest of the people.
[02:39:21.929 --> 02:39:23.090]  I'm sorry to the other callers.
[02:39:23.090 --> 02:39:23.891]  I'm sorry to Ben Fuchs.
[02:39:23.891 --> 02:39:24.732]  I gotta get to this piece.
[02:39:24.732 --> 02:39:26.413]  Ben, thank you for all the time.
[02:39:26.413 --> 02:39:31.818]  Your show comes on every day on GCNLive.com and syndicated across the country right before this transmission.
[02:39:31.818 --> 02:39:32.679]  Thank you so much.
[02:39:32.679 --> 02:39:33.880]  It was great having you on.
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:34.721]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:39:34.721 --> 02:39:35.942]  There goes pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:39:35.942 --> 02:39:37.183]  Spent about an hour and a half with us.
[02:39:38.749 --> 02:39:42.991]  This next piece, ladies and gentlemen, is self-explanatory.
[02:39:42.991 --> 02:39:55.016]  This is our own reporter, Dan Bodondi, went out to Harvard, where they were going to have the Satanic Black Mass, when the Satanists ran around wild, reportedly, cursing and yelling and things in the church.
[02:39:55.016 --> 02:39:56.817]  Harvard said, you know what, it's canceled.
[02:39:56.817 --> 02:40:06.582]  So this ensued outside between the Satanists and the Christians, and it just illustrates how many out-of-their-gourd people there are out there.
[02:40:07.502 --> 02:40:10.224]  Uh, and it just turned into a total kook-fest.
[02:40:10.224 --> 02:40:16.268]  But, but here is inside the mind of these Satanists chanting and calling for the blood of the Christians.
[02:40:16.268 --> 02:40:17.108]  Here it is.
[02:40:17.108 --> 02:40:19.409]  Um, but I think something more important than me is going on.
[02:40:19.409 --> 02:40:25.713]  It seems like those friendly Christians are not being so friendly, so... YOU WANNA BE LOUD!
[02:40:25.713 --> 02:40:27.454]  YOU WANNA BE LOUD!
[02:40:27.454 --> 02:40:28.795]  LET THIS BE YOUR VICTORY!
[02:40:28.795 --> 02:40:30.096]  CHRISTIAN BLOOD!
[02:40:37.109 --> 02:40:38.571]  These people do this to get back at their parents.
[02:40:38.571 --> 02:40:41.393]  The Trumpet of Michael cannot silence the truth!
[02:40:41.393 --> 02:40:45.998]  The Trumpet of Michael will not silence the truth!
[02:40:45.998 --> 02:40:50.322]  The Trumpet of Michael can never silence the truth!
[02:40:50.322 --> 02:40:52.324]  You have the Christians blowing the horns.
[02:40:52.324 --> 02:40:53.105]  You're children!
[02:40:53.105 --> 02:40:53.465]  You're children!
[02:40:53.465 --> 02:40:54.106]  You go to 9 to 5!
[02:40:55.669 --> 02:40:57.572]  Dan Badandi for the InfoWars and Nightly News.
[02:40:57.572 --> 02:41:03.039]  I'm at Harvard University where a black satanic mass is supposed to take place later tonight.
[02:41:03.039 --> 02:41:07.845]  Protestors have gathered here to demand Harvard not to have the satanic mass.
[02:41:07.845 --> 02:41:09.106]  So are you all here protesting?
[02:41:09.815 --> 02:41:11.276]  I'm here to pray today.
[02:41:11.276 --> 02:41:21.766]  The first report was they moved the Black Mass off of campus, and it was going to go to a restaurant in Central Square, and now we've received a report from the New England Cable News that it's been cancelled altogether, so we're absolutely delighted.
[02:41:21.766 --> 02:41:25.809]  Apparently, protests do have an effect, even on Harvard.
[02:41:25.809 --> 02:41:31.995]  Harvard University was actually started as a Bible school, a place to train up people to be radical for Christ.
[02:41:33.877 --> 02:41:36.758]  Great abomination before God.
[02:41:36.758 --> 02:41:41.719]  I heard about the satanic ritual about a week ago and I've been following the events and decided to come down here and pray.
[02:41:41.719 --> 02:41:42.999]  And where are you from?
[02:41:42.999 --> 02:41:44.679]  Hopkinton, Massachusetts.
[02:41:44.679 --> 02:41:51.821]  We're not going to sit down and let people take what is most sacred to us and trample it underfoot.
[02:41:51.821 --> 02:41:59.943]  Just talking about some free expression or right to assemble or whatever is really just a subterfuge.
[02:42:00.763 --> 02:42:03.946]  They have speech codes at Harvard like everywhere else.
[02:42:03.946 --> 02:42:14.834]  And if they can't recognize this as the same kind of hate speech that they routinely shut down when it is from groups of a traditionalist bent, then they really have no business talking about hate speech as a principle at all.
[02:42:14.834 --> 02:42:16.855]  These Christians are very well spoken.
[02:42:16.855 --> 02:42:20.858]  It's our job to come out and speak the truth calmly and do something for God.
[02:42:20.858 --> 02:42:22.760]  Some of them are out of their minds.
[02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:23.881]  When he's being attacked.
[02:42:24.501 --> 02:42:34.868]  Uh, it makes me afraid, not for myself personally, but for society, for children, for these poor people that come to these things that are curious, because this stuff's dangerous.
[02:42:34.868 --> 02:42:35.408]  This is real.
[02:42:35.408 --> 02:42:36.569]  It's dangerous.
[02:42:36.569 --> 02:42:39.130]  I am here to witness the black mass, yes.
[02:42:39.130 --> 02:42:40.772]  Okay, now, would you want to take part of it?
[02:42:40.772 --> 02:42:42.533]  Are you protesting?
[02:42:42.533 --> 02:42:44.334]  I would have taken part in the black mass.
[02:42:44.334 --> 02:42:45.134]  Why not?
[02:42:45.134 --> 02:42:46.475]  I've taken part in their mass.
[02:42:46.475 --> 02:42:48.156]  Why not the black mass?
[02:42:48.156 --> 02:42:49.777]  Hey, how you doing, man?
[02:42:49.777 --> 02:42:50.638]  Oh, I'm a girl.
[02:42:52.062 --> 02:42:54.225]  Look how inherently weak these Satanists are.
[02:42:54.225 --> 02:42:55.026]  I'm good.
[02:42:55.026 --> 02:42:58.210]  That other guy just called me that, so I was confused.
[02:42:58.210 --> 02:43:00.172]  I think it's a violation of their rights.
[02:43:00.172 --> 02:43:08.663]  If they wanted to hold a satanic ritual, like, again, as I said, as long as it's not hurting anyone, as long as no one's harmed during it, there should be no reason why it needs to be canceled.
[02:43:08.663 --> 02:43:09.885]  They're banning Christian groups all over the country.
[02:43:11.269 --> 02:43:14.233]  As far as I can tell, there's no good reason to cancel the event.
[02:43:14.233 --> 02:43:18.519]  There's no violent crowds out here.
[02:43:18.519 --> 02:43:21.023]  Everyone seems to be peacefully minding their own business.
[02:43:21.023 --> 02:43:22.826]  These are all death metal people trying to get publicity.
[02:43:23.848 --> 02:43:24.408]  They're anti-
[02:43:42.739 --> 02:43:43.379]  We are pro-Satan.
[02:43:43.379 --> 02:43:43.939]  We are anti-Satan.
[02:43:43.939 --> 02:43:44.660]  And pro-anti-pro-God.
[02:43:44.660 --> 02:43:45.160]  So pro-God.
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:45.860]  Men were yelling at each other.
[02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:52.702]  So I'm saying maybe like not men yelling would be like a third thing as opposed to God versus Satan.
[02:44:06.626 --> 02:44:07.587]  All right, thank you, ma'am.
[02:44:07.587 --> 02:44:08.807]  Yeah, totally.
[02:44:08.807 --> 02:44:15.629]  Still, I just find it kind of funny how, like, the Christians won't allow anyone to have a satanic black mass, but they can have their own mass and no one protests.
[02:44:15.629 --> 02:44:17.550]  Because historically, black masses, they kill babies.
[02:44:17.550 --> 02:44:19.151]  They're saying they're right.
[02:44:19.151 --> 02:44:22.132]  And the way they think is the only way to think.
[02:44:22.132 --> 02:44:25.053]  And if you think on the opposite side, in satanism, you're wrong and stupid.
[02:44:25.433 --> 02:44:39.438]  Well, the reason I'm here is to make sure that the actual message of the so-called adversary, Satan, Satan means enemy, I don't know if everyone knows that, but the so-called adversary is not actually what Satan's about.
[02:44:39.438 --> 02:44:42.439]  Satan's about love, kindness, acceptance, liberty, truth.
[02:44:42.439 --> 02:44:45.941]  Those are just five of the bullet points, the five points of the pentagram.
[02:44:47.386 --> 02:45:01.553]  My god is Bast, the Egyptian god of war, and I just yesterday invited Giza into my heart, which is a female Jesus, more scantily clad than a regular Jesus.
[02:45:01.553 --> 02:45:03.514]  Lucian Greaves is not even his name.
[02:45:03.514 --> 02:45:05.095]  His real name is Doug Mesner.
[02:45:05.095 --> 02:45:08.136]  He is a fake to the extreme.
[02:45:08.136 --> 02:45:10.957]  Anybody that reads his page knows this.
[02:45:10.957 --> 02:45:12.418]  He's admitted he's not a fake.
[02:45:12.418 --> 02:45:14.559]  So now we have Satanist saying other people aren't really Satanists.
[02:45:14.599 --> 02:45:16.720]  So what he's trying to do is piss people off, so to speak?
[02:45:42.054 --> 02:45:44.555]  Let me tell you, Satanists aren't going to get many followers.
[02:45:44.555 --> 02:45:46.595]  Women are ugly.
[02:45:46.595 --> 02:45:48.335]  We all despise them.
[02:45:48.335 --> 02:45:49.496]  Are you a Satanist yourself?
[02:45:49.496 --> 02:45:50.156]  Yes, I am.
[02:45:50.156 --> 02:45:54.157]  So basically what you're saying, he's not a real Satanist?
[02:45:54.157 --> 02:45:55.897]  He's not a Satanist on any level.
[02:45:55.897 --> 02:45:57.217]  He's admitted to it.
[02:45:57.217 --> 02:46:10.800]  The statue in Oklahoma and the Black Mass statue were completely separate and I was a little disappointed at all the press we got for the Black Mass because I feel it overshadows the more important issue of the monument.
[02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:16.743]  Um, and he's working the stature they want to put up in Oklahoma, and here's the real kick in the head.
[02:46:16.743 --> 02:46:23.708]  The person whose name is on the papers that is actually enabling him to do this is the wife of a convicted sex offender.
[02:46:23.708 --> 02:46:27.130]  The satanic church is in the back of Adam and Kelsey Daniels' home.
[02:46:27.310 --> 02:46:27.970]  Look at these people.
[02:46:42.995 --> 02:46:43.996]  You know what?
[02:46:43.996 --> 02:46:46.337]  Satan is here, and he ain't going anywhere.
[02:46:46.337 --> 02:46:54.142]  We have your children, we have everyone that we need to defeat you, because in the last war, there was one third and we almost won.
[02:46:54.142 --> 02:46:58.164]  Michael, Anu, I don't care what you go by now, we will defeat you.
[02:46:58.164 --> 02:47:03.147]  Now, does this scare you or infuriate you that this stuff is now going on in the public?
[02:47:03.892 --> 02:47:15.010]  It actually infuriates me, but it also strengthens my faith and makes me want to become a militant for my church and come out and stand up for the truth and what's good and right.
[02:47:15.010 --> 02:47:17.354]  I think it shocks and disappoints me more than anything else.
[02:47:17.904 --> 02:47:23.492]  Now Homeland Security, now our own government is now classifying the average Christian now as a domestic terrorist.
[02:47:23.492 --> 02:47:26.516]  Now how does that make you feel that our government is now targeting us?
[02:47:26.516 --> 02:47:33.586]  I do know that I've seen a lot of Democrat political figures talking about Christians as terrorists.
[02:47:34.207 --> 02:47:47.657]  Well, I guess it makes me know that the people in my government are no longer representing me and that I have to continue to know my faith and believe in my faith and trust in God that in the end he will prevail.
[02:47:47.657 --> 02:47:55.584]  I expect that saying what the Bible teaches eventually is going to be illegal and so be it.
[02:47:55.584 --> 02:47:57.225]  We have to keep saying it.
[02:47:57.225 --> 02:47:58.426]  We live in dangerous times.
[02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:01.169]  I think it's horrible.
[02:48:01.169 --> 02:48:03.630]  I mean, what else is there to say?
[02:48:03.630 --> 02:48:21.554]  All sorts of organizations, disreputable organizations that have their own agendas, like the Southern Poverty Law Center and groups like that, demonize Christians who want to publicly profess their faith, like we are, and who oppose all sorts of abominations against marriage, abortion... And that's all considered to them hate speech.
[02:48:21.994 --> 02:48:23.235]  Yeah, it's considered hate speech.
[02:48:23.235 --> 02:48:29.598]  But of course they engage in their own hate speech by vilifying us, and there's a nice double standard that they have for themselves.
[02:48:29.598 --> 02:48:34.580]  The protesters that say otherwise, unfortunately, are... they're just believing what they're told.
[02:48:34.580 --> 02:48:37.862]  I mean, not everyone has a genius IQ like me and Kanye West.
[02:48:38.582 --> 02:48:41.904]  So it's really hard for everyone else to figure it out.
[02:48:41.904 --> 02:48:43.325]  But I figured it out, I can tell you.
[02:48:43.325 --> 02:48:46.467]  We were physically pushed out of the airport by anyone.
[02:48:46.467 --> 02:48:47.848]  He didn't touch nobody.
[02:48:47.848 --> 02:48:51.631]  These are violent... We got thrown out of a public space.
[02:48:51.631 --> 02:48:53.792]  We were physically shoved, darned pushed.
[02:48:58.035 --> 02:49:00.078]  I bet Joe wanted a blowjob, didn't you?
[02:49:00.078 --> 02:49:07.747]  So right here at the church behind us, the gentlemen who were leading this event tonight actually came in to the pulpit.
[02:49:07.747 --> 02:49:10.710]  I was kind of walking away and headed back to the parking garage.
[02:49:10.710 --> 02:49:17.878]  They came into this church right here, went behind the pulpit, pushed people out from behind the pulpit, and started screaming aggressively, Hail Satan, etc.
[02:49:18.779 --> 02:49:19.059]  Yeah.
[02:49:19.059 --> 02:49:22.282]  Just basically trying to worship Satan in this house of God right here.
[02:49:22.282 --> 02:49:23.082]  That's why they got thrown out.
[02:49:23.082 --> 02:49:25.344]  So I did go in and just kind of told them they needed to leave.
[02:49:25.344 --> 02:49:29.246]  And at that point, several gentlemen from the church behind us did escort them out.
[02:49:29.246 --> 02:49:30.287]  They did not go willingly.
[02:49:30.287 --> 02:49:32.548]  They were actually violent in the process.
[02:49:32.548 --> 02:49:37.532]  And they were screaming and trespassing until the police actually came about five minutes later.
[02:49:37.532 --> 02:49:38.953]  And then they changed their whole story.
[02:49:38.953 --> 02:49:40.393]  So that's what happened.
[02:49:40.393 --> 02:49:45.457]  And as you can see, it's a great spiritual divide as we got comments from people from both sides of the fence.
[02:49:45.457 --> 02:49:46.938]  But yeah, this is the question.
[02:49:47.498 --> 02:49:56.848]  Could this be another attempt by the mainstream media and the government to not only divide the American citizen politically and racially, but also spiritually as well?
[02:49:56.848 --> 02:49:58.530]  That's a question you may want to ask.
[02:49:58.530 --> 02:50:02.834]  And this is Dan Bodondi for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:50:02.834 --> 02:50:08.941]  I fear losing Christ more than I do of this in itself, because Christ is greater than this.
[02:50:10.492 --> 02:50:13.494]  Well, the Christians were very well-spoken overall.
[02:50:13.494 --> 02:50:15.715]  There was a few kooky ones, but that's to be expected.
[02:50:15.715 --> 02:50:27.342]  And people get passionate, but the Satanists, when you watch the video, I'm going to have the video posted right now on InfoWars.com, we'll tweet it out at RealAlexJones, are just hateful people.
[02:50:27.342 --> 02:50:29.423]  And they want our children.
[02:50:29.423 --> 02:50:32.425]  In fact, they say our children belong to them.
[02:50:32.425 --> 02:50:39.910]  And all I can say is, is that if one of those people, if I was in that church, put their hands on me, I'll show them how powerful Satan is.
[02:50:41.223 --> 02:50:45.244]  The Satan's not going to be able to do jack squat for him when I knock their teeth out.
[02:50:45.244 --> 02:50:47.245]  Those people are weak, and that's why they worship Satan.
[02:50:47.245 --> 02:50:48.685]  They're looking for power.
[02:50:48.685 --> 02:50:54.707]  If they had real power, they'd hit their knees before the creator of the universe and stop being such worm-like scum.
[02:50:54.707 --> 02:50:58.448]  But they love their father, and they love weakness because they're failures.
[02:50:58.448 --> 02:50:58.908]  We'll be back.
[02:50:58.908 --> 02:50:59.368]  Stay with me.
[02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:04.563]  Clean water at home, clean water at the office, clean water on the go.

[02:51:30.552 --> 02:51:35.115]  Memorial Day is a time of remembrance of our fallen soldiers who died for our freedom.

[02:52:01.047 --> 02:52:03.468]  Texas is facing a killer drought.
[02:52:03.468 --> 02:52:12.931]  For 50 years, projects which could have protected us from this were sabotaged by Wall Street profiteering and the Zero Growth Anti-Science Green Agenda.
[02:52:12.931 --> 02:52:15.532]  Today, these projects will not be enough.
[02:52:15.532 --> 02:52:19.394]  We need a revolution in real science to take the lid off human progress.
[02:52:20.134 --> 02:52:21.335]  I'm Keisha Rogers.
[02:52:21.335 --> 02:52:25.417]  When you vote for me on May 27th in the Democratic runoff election for U.S.
[02:52:25.417 --> 02:52:38.685]  Senate, you will be voting to put our space program back to work, to bring online thermonuclear fusion energy, and discover how the sun influences atmospheric dynamics and climate, so we can control these things for the benefit of mankind.
[02:52:39.245 --> 02:52:41.647]  We must stop this fracking nonsense.
[02:52:41.647 --> 02:52:43.768]  Shell gas is not an economic boom.
[02:52:43.768 --> 02:52:45.809]  It's a backward strategy for doom.
[02:52:45.809 --> 02:52:55.295]  Vote for me, Kesha Rogers, in the Democratic runoff on May 27 to reject Wall Street sabotage and ensure a fruitful and productive future for Texas and the nation.
[02:52:55.295 --> 02:52:57.437]  I'm Kesha Rogers and I authorize this message.
[02:52:57.437 --> 02:52:58.898]  Paid for by Kesha Rogers for U.S.
[02:52:58.898 --> 02:52:59.178]  Senate.
[02:53:00.103 --> 02:53:02.926]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:53:02.926 --> 02:53:08.050]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:53:08.050 --> 02:53:16.177]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:53:16.177 --> 02:53:20.702]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:53:20.702 --> 02:53:24.505]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:53:24.665 --> 02:53:30.606]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:53:30.606 --> 02:53:33.767]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:53:33.767 --> 02:53:39.148]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:53:39.148 --> 02:53:47.310]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:53:47.310 --> 02:53:47.630]  That's 866-229-0927.
[02:53:47.630 --> 02:53:48.110]  Do business
[02:53:54.551 --> 02:53:57.914]  Well, I predicted it back when it all went down over three years ago.
[02:54:17.605 --> 02:54:20.346]  When it all started, it took him a year to oust Gaddafi.
[02:54:20.346 --> 02:54:25.489]  Not a good guy, but compared to the globalists, he was building up Africa, he was working with the West.
[02:54:25.489 --> 02:54:25.929]  The U.S.
[02:54:25.929 --> 02:54:28.590]  moves more forces closer to Libya as unrest grows.
[02:54:28.590 --> 02:54:32.572]  Reuters, the United States has increased the number of Marines and aircraft stationed in Sicily.
[02:54:32.572 --> 02:54:35.114]  They're going to be called upon to evacuate Americans from the U.S.
[02:54:35.114 --> 02:54:36.214]  Embassy in Tripoli.
[02:54:36.214 --> 02:54:37.895]  As unrest in Libya grows, two U.S.
[02:54:37.895 --> 02:54:39.716]  officials said Monday.
[02:54:39.716 --> 02:54:45.219]  And they've just basically turned the whole country over to Al Qaeda, and now there's talk of having to go in and, quote, stabilize the country.
[02:54:45.947 --> 02:54:48.189]  Create the crisis, offer the solution.
[02:54:48.189 --> 02:54:50.191]  And again, the average troops don't even know what's going on.
[02:54:50.191 --> 02:54:52.653]  It's just so immoral.
[02:54:52.653 --> 02:54:55.755]  I mentioned this earlier, but it's so incredible to me.
[02:54:55.755 --> 02:55:00.359]  Report says 50% of people are conspiracy theorists.
[02:55:00.359 --> 02:55:02.961]  You're probably one of them.
[02:55:02.961 --> 02:55:07.165]  That's up on Infowars.com by Elizabeth Rentner.
[02:55:07.165 --> 02:55:10.968]  And it's JAMA, the Journal of American Medical Association.
[02:55:13.078 --> 02:55:24.466]  And they said that you can be a simple-minded, that's a eugenics term, medical conspiracy kook is what they write about, if you believe the following.
[02:55:24.466 --> 02:55:38.975]  Now imagine this, this is what doctors reading the American Medical Association's journal, JAMA, that if your patient says this, this is a bad person, and the doctor can laugh at you and feel like an authority.
[02:55:41.710 --> 02:55:46.791]  Because you believe cell phones are causing cancer and the government is refusing to act.
[02:55:46.791 --> 02:55:50.512]  Yes, and you believe the sun came up this morning as well, and other kooky things.
[02:55:50.512 --> 02:55:53.692]  GMO labeling used for population control.
[02:55:53.692 --> 02:55:56.733]  Or GM- I had a Freudian slip, I wish we had GMO labeling.
[02:55:56.733 --> 02:56:00.174]  It's GMOs being used for population control.
[02:56:00.174 --> 02:56:03.334]  Well, that's what they're piggybacking into many of the GMOs.
[02:56:03.334 --> 02:56:06.475]  The government's suppressing alternative medicine.
[02:56:06.475 --> 02:56:08.335]  Well, that's on record they are.
[02:56:08.335 --> 02:56:11.196]  And that vaccinations are causing autism, and they're clearly linked to it.
[02:56:13.004 --> 02:56:18.386]  And HIV was intentionally being sent into African-American communities.
[02:56:18.386 --> 02:56:24.947]  Well, it's definitely race-specific and affects non-Northern Europeans more.
[02:56:24.947 --> 02:56:34.230]  The virus from medical doctors we've had on, the T lymphocytes of Northern Europeans don't have the same
[02:56:35.802 --> 02:56:40.347]  Receptor sites is what I, and again I'm not a doctor, I'm just going off what's been broken down.
[02:56:40.347 --> 02:56:49.077]  It's very hard, this is in mainline medical literature, you can look it up, for what is known as Aryans to get HIV.
[02:56:49.077 --> 02:56:55.904]  It does happen mainly from massive anal sex or run down immune systems and intravenous drug use.
[02:56:56.803 --> 02:57:04.551]  Where you've been using bad drugs that have heavy metals and grignard reagents and other things in it, that already kill your T-lymphocytes.
[02:57:04.551 --> 02:57:07.814]  And then the virus is able to move in, you get the cancers, the rest of it.
[02:57:07.814 --> 02:57:09.876]  And I've had so many scientists on about this, but...
[02:57:11.414 --> 02:57:18.842]  Nearly half of 49% of participants in the study conducted by JAMA said they believe with at least one of the theories.
[02:57:18.842 --> 02:57:22.466]  So JAMA is shaking their hands in fear.
[02:57:22.466 --> 02:57:26.249]  My gosh, my gosh, they think cell phones are hurting them.
[02:57:26.249 --> 02:57:28.432]  I mean, it's been on record since the things came out.
[02:57:30.202 --> 02:57:45.088]  Meanwhile, it's come out now that they're going to remove most of the soap off the store shelves because 75% of it is called antibacterial and has a chemical known to manipulate your hormones and reduce fertility and do a bunch of other horrible things.
[02:57:45.088 --> 02:57:47.249]  It's done by design.
[02:57:47.249 --> 02:57:50.530]  Through things that are ubiquitously used.
[02:57:50.530 --> 02:57:51.891]  Printer ink.
[02:57:51.891 --> 02:57:54.131]  Water.
[02:57:54.131 --> 02:57:55.052]  Plastic linings.
[02:57:56.155 --> 02:58:03.623]  They get us coming and going, and it's in the White House Science Czar's book, written the year I was born, 40 years ago.
[02:58:03.623 --> 02:58:04.504]  1974.
[02:58:04.504 --> 02:58:07.868]  Ecoscience.
[02:58:07.868 --> 02:58:13.795]  I mean, these people think you're so dumb, this stuff's all hiding in plain view.
[02:58:13.795 --> 02:58:15.257]  Pricklesand is the name of the chemical.
[02:58:16.616 --> 02:58:17.937]  And don't believe them.
[02:58:17.937 --> 02:58:19.558]  I mean, mothers never nurse their babies.
[02:58:19.558 --> 02:58:22.220]  They gave their babies trickle sand at birth.
[02:58:22.220 --> 02:58:23.341]  Satan is here.
[02:58:23.341 --> 02:58:25.382]  And he ain't going anywhere.
[02:58:25.382 --> 02:58:27.304]  We have your children.
[02:58:27.304 --> 02:58:31.086]  We have everyone that we need.
[02:58:31.086 --> 02:58:33.949]  And that is that punk Satan that slowed down.
[02:58:33.949 --> 02:58:35.189]  Isn't he scary?
[02:58:35.189 --> 02:58:36.530]  Aren't you scared of him?
[02:58:36.530 --> 02:58:38.492]  Don't you want to stomp his head in the ground?
[02:58:38.492 --> 02:58:39.372]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:58:39.372 --> 02:58:40.813]  I'm going to do a little bit of overdrive here.
[02:58:40.813 --> 02:58:41.434]  I don't want to do that.
[02:58:41.434 --> 02:58:42.535]  I want to love you.
[02:58:44.066 --> 02:58:46.027]  You'll find he's just a nerd who's scared.
[02:58:46.027 --> 02:58:50.390]  I don't think he really wants to know Satan.
[02:58:50.390 --> 02:58:52.871]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[02:58:52.871 --> 02:58:59.575]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[02:58:59.575 --> 02:59:02.356]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[02:59:02.356 --> 02:59:04.297]  If not, then I want to know why.
[02:59:04.297 --> 02:59:06.599]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[02:59:06.599 --> 02:59:10.821]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[02:59:11.081 --> 02:59:12.242]  I say, so what?
[02:59:12.242 --> 02:59:14.443]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[02:59:14.443 --> 02:59:17.825]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[02:59:17.825 --> 02:59:22.087]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[02:59:22.087 --> 02:59:26.410]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[02:59:26.670 --> 02:59:27.911]  And I'm still fighting.
[02:59:27.911 --> 02:59:31.154]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[02:59:31.154 --> 02:59:32.976]  The Infowar is worldwide.
[02:59:32.976 --> 02:59:37.300]  Tell your friends about Infowars and let them know that Infowars doesn't print bull.
[02:59:37.300 --> 02:59:41.023]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[02:59:41.023 --> 02:59:48.269]  Step up and take your friends and family to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfowars.com.
[02:59:48.269 --> 02:59:49.731]  The truth will set them free.
[02:59:51.314 --> 02:59:54.922]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.922 --> 02:59:58.109]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.700 --> 03:00:10.605]  They made a male clone of a cross between Janet Reno
[03:00:27.731 --> 03:00:32.758]  Janet Napolitano, Rachel Maddow, then Maddow plays the part of a guy too.
[03:00:32.758 --> 03:00:34.821]  Who's the other host on there she plays the part of?
[03:00:34.821 --> 03:00:36.644]  She's an accomplished actress.
[03:00:36.644 --> 03:00:39.128]  Who's the guy on there that she looks like?
[03:00:40.290 --> 03:00:48.912]  If you crossed all of them together, you would get this, and his name is Dung Beetle the Satanist.
[03:00:48.912 --> 03:00:52.853]  This is outside the Black Mass in Harvard, as he announces how powerful he is.
[03:00:52.853 --> 03:00:56.814]  He probably lives on the street, because Satan has given him so much power.
[03:00:56.814 --> 03:00:59.894]  And I'm sorry to talk like a tough guy, I don't usually do that.
[03:00:59.894 --> 03:01:03.235]  I just literally want to
[03:01:05.828 --> 03:01:10.870]  Well, I just really want to stomp on these people when I see them dancing around and acting tough.
[03:01:10.870 --> 03:01:14.811]  I just, there's, like, I don't see anybody and I want to attack them.
[03:01:14.811 --> 03:01:20.933]  But these gutter Satanists, I literally sing They've Got Our Kids, but I'm not saying attack them, I wouldn't attack them.
[03:01:20.933 --> 03:01:25.634]  I'm saying I'm having a visceral response of revulsion.
[03:01:25.634 --> 03:01:28.475]  And I think it's to the weakness.
[03:01:28.475 --> 03:01:31.496]  The weak, soul-sucked, pathetic wraith
[03:01:32.455 --> 03:01:34.196]  Uh, saying our kids belong to him.
[03:01:34.196 --> 03:01:38.158]  But I guess, in a way, the higher level Satanists and Luciferians do run the planet.
[03:01:38.158 --> 03:01:40.560]  Can we kill the MSNBC where she says the kids belong to us?
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:45.543]  Because that's always the refrain, your children belong to us.
[03:01:45.543 --> 03:01:46.803]  Uh, whatever that lady's name is.
[03:01:46.803 --> 03:01:48.644]  She has the same gleam in her eye.
[03:01:48.644 --> 03:01:50.826]  Melissa Harris Perry.
[03:01:50.826 --> 03:01:55.068]  So let's go ahead and go to this, uh, creature, uh, this, this thing.
[03:01:55.068 --> 03:01:55.809]  There it sits.
[03:01:55.809 --> 03:01:56.349]  Here it is.
[03:01:56.349 --> 03:01:57.449]  Satan is here.
[03:01:57.449 --> 03:01:58.650]  And he ain't going anywhere.
[03:01:58.650 --> 03:02:00.091]  We have your children.
[03:02:00.091 --> 03:02:01.632]  We have everyone that we need.
[03:02:04.643 --> 03:02:06.765]  Let's play the longer clip of that guy.
[03:02:06.765 --> 03:02:07.465]  What's his name?
[03:02:07.465 --> 03:02:12.870]  You guys didn't get his name when you were there?
[03:02:12.870 --> 03:02:16.254]  I mean, look, it's just unbelievable.
[03:02:16.254 --> 03:02:24.061]  I mean, wanting to be bad and then saying Satan gives you love and Satan gives you liberty.
[03:02:27.771 --> 03:02:28.251]  That's for us.
[03:02:46.772 --> 03:02:54.694]  No, it makes me like when I see a big cockroach, I go turn my lights on at night, and there's a big, big palmetto bug on the sink eating a piece of bread or something.
[03:02:54.694 --> 03:02:56.274]  That's how I feel about you.
[03:02:56.274 --> 03:02:57.234]  I don't feel scared.
[03:02:57.234 --> 03:03:06.476]  I have this instinct, like I do with a roach, a real serious desire that you not escape.
[03:03:06.476 --> 03:03:07.856]  I'm sorry.
[03:03:07.856 --> 03:03:12.397]  I mean, people saying, because just, you know, earlier in the clip, he's talking about how
[03:03:13.470 --> 03:03:16.357]  Satan loves you to give you freedom, but you have our kids.
[03:03:16.357 --> 03:03:17.078]  Our kids!
[03:03:17.078 --> 03:03:19.904]  You want our kids because you're so into liberty, right?
[03:03:22.756 --> 03:03:31.819]  Let's go ahead and go to the technocrat, the anti-family socialist on MSNBC in their promo, echoing the satanist.
[03:03:31.819 --> 03:03:40.101]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[03:03:40.101 --> 03:03:44.883]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[03:03:44.883 --> 03:03:47.924]  And then they have the famous communist slogan, lean forward.
[03:03:47.924 --> 03:03:49.864]  Imagine her and that satanist at dinner.
[03:03:49.864 --> 03:03:51.925]  They're both seeking after temporal power.
[03:03:52.665 --> 03:03:56.006]  They both are convinced of how great they are and they should run everything.
[03:03:56.006 --> 03:03:59.147]  I got an idea for you and the Satanist, Perry.
[03:03:59.147 --> 03:04:01.168]  Keep your hands off our children.
[03:04:01.168 --> 03:04:02.209]  Stay out of our life.
[03:04:02.209 --> 03:04:03.249]  You're a wreck.
[03:04:03.249 --> 03:04:04.890]  You're a powerless joke.
[03:04:04.890 --> 03:04:11.192]  That's why you seek to use our goodwill to go along with your orders as if you're the moral high ground.
[03:04:11.192 --> 03:04:16.094]  You are the same as that dirtbag devil worshipper.
[03:04:16.094 --> 03:04:18.695]  You are weak from the foundations of the earth.
[03:04:18.695 --> 03:04:19.455]  You are scum.
[03:04:21.463 --> 03:04:45.219]  All of you that seek to hurt innocents, that seek to mutate the planet, and the genetic code that God created, you are an abomination, desolation, and you will beg, if the New World Order comes into full fruition in your lifetime, you will beg God for forgiveness, in the final equation, because you're so cowardly, and so pathetic, and so chicken-necked, and so unbelievably weak,
[03:04:46.124 --> 03:04:47.746]  You are weak!
[03:04:47.746 --> 03:04:51.310]  And it is so sad to see someone so pathetic.
[03:04:51.310 --> 03:04:55.375]  I didn't know they piled crap that high, Perry.
[03:04:55.375 --> 03:04:56.637]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
