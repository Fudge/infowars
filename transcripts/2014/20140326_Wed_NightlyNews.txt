[00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:21.572]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.652 --> 00:00:22.933]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:27.015]  It's March 26, 2014, and let's get straight into our news tonight.
[00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:31.098]  Top story, troops practice storming a university building in Fort Lauderdale.
[00:00:31.578 --> 00:00:40.223]  Residents in Fort Lauderdale were shocked to see Navy SEALs practicing storming a university building from a black hot chopper as part of military drills taking place this week.
[00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:52.225]  As we reported yesterday, the media only announced that the Department of Defense exercises were taking place across the country after panic residents reported low-flying military helicopters on Monday evening.
[00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:58.606]  And it's not just in Fort Lauderdale, because they're having these drills right here in Austin, Texas, but they're not with Black Hawk choppers.
[00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:03.547]  They're with largely unmarked planes that have little Navy logos that we think we can make out.
[00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:07.268]  But regardless, we want to find out what's going on, so let's talk to the airport right now.
[00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.372]  Aviation Public Information, this is Jason.
[00:01:11.992 --> 00:01:15.333]  Yes, this is Jakari Jackson, reporter for InfoWars.com.
[00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:16.593]  Hey Jakari.
[00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:17.273]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:20.534]  I had a question about the plane that's flying around today.
[00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:22.615]  It was a white plane, largely unmarked.
[00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:25.096]  I think I may have spotted a Navy logo on it.
[00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:26.456]  Do you guys know anything about that?
[00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:30.938]  Yeah, we've heard that it's an E-6.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.583]  B-707 aircraft that's doing touch-and-go practice landings on our west runway.
[00:01:41.444 --> 00:01:44.045]  Practice touch-and-go landings are very common.
[00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:50.227]  And we're not just a commercial airport, we're also a general aviation and military.
[00:01:50.247 --> 00:01:58.150]  We also have a lot of military aircraft that come in and out, so it's not unusual to have touch-and-go landings.
[00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:02.232]  When they're performing the touch-and-go landings, their altitude stays at a pretty low
[00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:04.442]  No, that's a question for the FAA.
[00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:06.223]  We don't have any of that information.
[00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:09.305]  They're the ones that basically have to file with the FAA on their activity.
[00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.783]  I have a public affairs number if you want to reach out to the FAA.
[00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:36.843]  Sure, just one second.
[00:02:36.863 --> 00:02:38.225]  Can you give me the type of plane?
[00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:41.687]  You said it was an E6B?
[00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:42.008]  B707.
[00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:42.448]  B707.
[00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:43.229]  Okay.
[00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.211]  And have you got any other calls?
[00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:47.832]  Anybody else calling in concerned about this?
[00:02:49.874 --> 00:02:59.202]  Yeah, we've had just some inquiries into the plane and what it's doing and why it's flying basically lower than
[00:03:00.134 --> 00:03:06.335]  What is normally, they normally see aircraft flying at that altitude in and out of the airport.
[00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:09.316]  I think mainly because of its size.
[00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:10.536]  Right.
[00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:14.217]  And also because it's rush hour right now, so a lot of people are seeing it.
[00:03:14.797 --> 00:03:17.458]  But it's been performing this throughout the day, off and on.
[00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958]  And you guys had a similar drill sometime last year, did you not?
[00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.619]  Yeah, I believe so.
[00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:29.820]  A similar aircraft, I think the same size aircraft, I don't know if it was the same one or not.
[00:03:30.524 --> 00:03:40.193]  And like I said, it's a common occurrence at the airport, just usually not an aircraft of this size, and so that's why it's garnering more attention.
[00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:48.581]  More times than not, it's usually like the general aviation plane, so they're very small and people don't take note of it as much as they do something this size.
[00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:50.483]  Well, thank you so much for your time.
[00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:51.184]  No problem.
[00:03:51.204 --> 00:03:51.484]  Take care.
[00:03:51.504 --> 00:03:51.924]  All right.
[00:03:51.984 --> 00:03:52.205]  Goodbye.
[00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:52.645]  Bye.
[00:03:53.874 --> 00:03:55.335]  So we tried to talk to the FAA.
[00:03:55.395 --> 00:04:03.360]  Their representative was not immediately available for comment, but we were told by the Austin PIO that the plane was indeed a E6B707.
[00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:05.362]  So they're running drills.
[00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:06.643]  Not exactly sure why.
[00:04:06.683 --> 00:04:09.504]  He also confirmed that they ran a similar drill last year.
[00:04:09.524 --> 00:04:13.527]  You guys may recall that incident where the plane was flying low just like it was today.
[00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.109]  So I'm not sure why they are running these drills.
[00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:18.851]  Do they have some type of plot involved?
[00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:20.132]  Is it just to acclimate the public?
[00:04:20.172 --> 00:04:20.592]  Who knows?
[00:04:20.852 --> 00:04:23.554]  But we'll keep an eye on it right here at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:27.176]  Woman claims police forced her to poop in her yard.
[00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:28.336]  That's quite the transition.
[00:04:28.797 --> 00:04:37.021]  In a lawsuit, Brooks claims the officers refused to let her go to the bathroom inside of her home and or use the officer's truck when she was let out in handcuffs.
[00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:43.985]  Officers reportedly told her just to use the restroom right there in her front yard, said the District Judge Rory Dalton Jr.
[00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:50.471]  Judge Dalton dismissed the claims last week and Brooks can amend her civil rights complaint until April 4th.
[00:05:05.768 --> 00:05:11.650]  Girlfriend was on her cycle and she did not have the proper toiletries to, you know, keep herself clean the way she wanted to.
[00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:19.654]  She had blood running down her legs and nobody really seemed to care because, you know, they were in Fallujah mode treating American citizens as if they were enemy combatants.
[00:05:19.934 --> 00:05:24.576]  And that's what happens in this country and people just get acclimated to it, they get used to it, and it becomes the norm.
[00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:27.277]  I don't want these type of things to be the norm where you have to poop
[00:05:29.898 --> 00:05:34.981]  That's not the type of law enforcement we need in our country.
[00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:39.644]  If you do have an ear to law enforcement or military personnel, make sure they do not act in such a way.
[00:05:39.684 --> 00:05:44.267]  This is how they treated people in Guantanamo Bay or continue to treat people in Guantanamo Bay.
[00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:45.568]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.977 --> 00:06:09.265]  Police say Silva began whirling the syringe around in a swinging motion and was able to stab one of the guards several times with the contaminated needle.
[00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:16.613]  But a concealed carrier pulled out their pistol and faced with the threat of deadly force, the suspect stopped fighting and complied with the order.
[00:06:17.013 --> 00:06:18.395]  And that's sometimes all it takes.
[00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:21.877]  Because you don't have to pull out your gun and start shooting indiscriminately.
[00:06:21.897 --> 00:06:27.000]  You can just pull out your gun, draw down and say, this is about to get very serious if you do not handle yourself accordingly.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.381]  And that's what happened in this situation.
[00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.643]  The man decided to drop his attack just like we saw the stories.
[00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:37.046]  The stories that don't get told in the mainstream about people pulling out their pistols and they end the conflict.
[00:06:37.247 --> 00:06:39.328]  There's a situation of the man in the mall shooting.
[00:06:39.748 --> 00:06:40.128]  I think so.
[00:07:02.682 --> 00:07:11.245]  Russia's state-owned news agency claims that the junta in Kiev has hired a Blackwater spinoff to act as a political police force in the eastern part of the country.
[00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:21.149]  Ukrainian authorities believe that the security service is not able to suppress the protest mood and neutralize the leadership and activists of the pro-Russian movement in the eastern region.
[00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:30.732]  Therefore, it was decided to attract foreign mercenaries who will serve as political police and state security protection, said the representative of the security service.
[00:07:31.212 --> 00:07:43.862]  Now, of course, our viewers know that Blackwater is most famous, or infamous, for a 2007 incident where they opened fire and killed 17 civilians in Iraq, as well as many other misdeeds along the way.
[00:07:43.902 --> 00:07:48.726]  We saw a guy who was at least wearing a Blackwater hat at South by Southwest last week, the week before.
[00:07:49.066 --> 00:07:50.027]  He denied it, but you know.
[00:07:50.894 --> 00:07:51.734]  We look like one to me.
[00:07:52.215 --> 00:07:58.478]  Regardless, you know, that's why they bring in these mercenary groups or these people who don't have a real emotional attachment to the people that they're policing.
[00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:05.422]  Just like we see them bringing in Russian troops to train with FEMA or at least the Russian government has put out press releases saying that that is the case.
[00:08:05.682 --> 00:08:09.804]  They plan to bring Russian troops over here to train for emergency disaster events.
[00:08:10.104 --> 00:08:13.006]  So for whatever reason things turn south and they have to deal with a
[00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:20.991]  I don't think it's a very good idea, but I don't really agree with a whole lot that's going on either in this country or the situation being handled in Ukraine.
[00:08:39.744 --> 00:08:46.891]  Pelletier allegedly suffers from a mitochondrial disease, a rare and controversial disorder where the body's cells can't produce energy.
[00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:57.803]  Her parents brought Justina to the Children's Hospital ER and they say the doctors quickly cast aside her diagnosis and instead concluded her problems were of a psychiatric origin.
[00:08:58.183 --> 00:08:58.683]  We're good to go.
[00:09:16.235 --> 00:09:18.496]  And if you have a problem with that, they'll take your child away.
[00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:21.717]  And that may seem like an extreme example, but that's exactly what's happening.
[00:09:22.017 --> 00:09:24.138]  The state is telling you what you can and cannot do.
[00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:27.079]  There was a story about the woman who had a SWAT team raid.
[00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.299]  They drove a tank up to her house.
[00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:36.722]  I believe this was a Natural News article a few years ago, where they come busting this woman's house because she refused to go with the treatments the state prescribed for her daughter.
[00:09:36.962 --> 00:09:37.702]  And that's what they do.
[00:09:37.802 --> 00:09:38.903]  They'll do what they want to do.
[00:09:38.923 --> 00:09:40.784]  And this is what a tyrannical government looks like.
[00:09:41.024 --> 00:09:42.624]  People say, what's this tyranny you guys talk about?
[00:09:42.644 --> 00:09:43.584]  This is the tyranny.
[00:09:43.805 --> 00:09:44.925]  We will take your child away.
[00:09:45.245 --> 00:09:48.787]  If we don't like what you're doing, we'll take your child away if you smoke a little bit of marijuana.
[00:09:48.807 --> 00:09:54.589]  And I'm not saying you should go out and light up a joint right now, but if that's what you do, I don't think your child should be taken away for that.
[00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.271]  And it's the same thing we see in this situation right here.
[00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:01.573]  And if they can't take your child away from you, they'll at least try to indoctrinate them and just make them...
[00:10:02.353 --> 00:10:02.673]  Dumb!
[00:10:03.014 --> 00:10:05.135]  This is the story we have right now with Common Core.
[00:10:05.416 --> 00:10:08.278]  You have 2 plus 2 equals 5 and now you have this.
[00:10:08.698 --> 00:10:14.263]  And the teacher wrote a response to a student and said, correct answers, but let's find the friendly numbers like 200.
[00:10:15.224 --> 00:10:22.230]  So even if you do your math correctly, your teacher is going to tell you that you didn't find the most friendly answers, the friendly numbers.
[00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.274]  So it's still wrong and it has a big Common Core logo right there on the edge of the paper.
[00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:29.876]  So you can know who's responsible for this.
[00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:30.856]  It's Common Core.
[00:10:30.876 --> 00:10:31.997]  It's No Child Left Behind.
[00:10:32.057 --> 00:10:33.178]  It's dumbing our students down.
[00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:37.741]  The deliberate dumbing down of the American public, just like Charlotte Isby said all those years ago.
[00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:40.483]  You can also find her work on the InfoWars shop.
[00:10:40.923 --> 00:10:42.905]  Great books and videos there as well.
[00:10:43.485 --> 00:10:43.685]  U.S.
[00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:47.368]  Navy tests homes for radiation in the San Francisco Island areas.
[00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:49.110]  So let's find out what's going on here.
[00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:59.398]  In the coming weeks, the Navy officials will begin surveying about 600 homes on Treasure Island, a man-made landmass in the San Francisco Bay that once served as a naval base.
[00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:09.086]  In the event of a radiological survey of the housing unit reveals a health concern, the Navy will take immediate action to protect the residents, the Navy said in a statement.
[00:11:09.927 --> 00:11:16.611]  So if you're not hip to the activities of Treasure Island, this is where they shipped out parts for the Manhattan Project, of course, that brought us the atomic bomb.
[00:11:16.871 --> 00:11:26.296]  They also had ships come in, and if the ships had toxic paint or whatever, they would scrape off the paint into the water, so you have toxic paint from your boat going into the water.
[00:11:26.576 --> 00:11:36.842]  They also had a plethora of dead farm animals, so if you live on Treasure Island or around that area, it's a very good chance that you may be sitting on a graveyard of radioactive horses or ducks or
[00:11:37.922 --> 00:11:38.602]  Cows, whatever.
[00:11:38.642 --> 00:11:39.383]  I'm not making that up.
[00:11:39.403 --> 00:11:40.603]  You can go look that up for yourself.
[00:11:41.063 --> 00:11:43.244]  So it's a very contaminated area as it is.
[00:11:43.284 --> 00:11:46.526]  You know, the Navy and other groups did try to clean it up years back.
[00:11:46.566 --> 00:11:48.366]  I'm not exactly sure how clean it is now.
[00:11:48.747 --> 00:11:51.988]  But you have this on top of the Fukushima radiation coming over.
[00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:56.850]  Already made contact with the United States, or at least the North American continent.
[00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:01.052]  And I'm pretty sure we'll have more reports of the Fukushima radiation as time develops.
[00:12:01.352 --> 00:12:06.354]  But we also have things such as right outside of San Francisco, a little bit southwest,
[00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:10.056]  And, you know, at the towns down there, they have high levels of radiation.
[00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:17.000]  We went down there, personally found radiation levels to be in excess of 10 times of what's considered to be normal for that area.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.401]  So, things to worry about if you're on the West Coast.
[00:12:19.741 --> 00:12:21.042]  And we don't know where else it's going to be.
[00:12:21.082 --> 00:12:21.943]  Is it on the East Coast?
[00:12:22.003 --> 00:12:22.943]  Is it, you know, down South?
[00:12:22.963 --> 00:12:23.343]  Who knows?
[00:12:23.684 --> 00:12:28.106]  But we definitely found high levels of radiation when we went out to the San Francisco area.
[00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:30.187]  Let's talk about Drudge, the Drudge Report.
[00:12:30.468 --> 00:12:35.951]  And now we have how Matt Drudge and the others, victims of Obamacare, can escape from the Liberty Tax.
[00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:43.558]  For Drudge and other Americans who don't want to buy Obamacare due to personal objections, there is a little-known hitch in the IRS.
[00:12:43.578 --> 00:12:54.669]  You can go to section 1501 on page 148 and there is a mandate, an opt-out exemption of the health care plan for health care sharing ministry.
[00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:55.970]  So you can go find that out.
[00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.611]  I know there are various groups out there.
[00:12:57.631 --> 00:13:04.738]  I don't want to promote any particular one, but some guys in the office use these ministry exemptions, and it's something I'm actually looking into for myself.
[00:13:04.758 --> 00:13:06.719]  So hopefully there is a way out.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.042]  And our final story for the night, lies, lies, and more lies.
[00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:13.545]  Seattle police secretly keep drones despite promise.
[00:13:13.565 --> 00:13:17.188]  Because you remember, the Seattle mayor said that, hey, I don't want these drones in my city.
[00:13:17.228 --> 00:13:19.931]  The police said, okay, we'll fly the drones without your consent.
[00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:26.436]  So this is pretty much the story that we have here, and this is actually the story that's going to be our second in our second block tonight.
[00:13:26.596 --> 00:13:32.401]  We'll be talking about drones, whether they're drones here domestically, with these smaller drones, or the big predator drones, and all the drones in between.
[00:13:32.421 --> 00:13:33.281]  So stay tuned for that.
[00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:36.124]  These weaponized drones coming to a city near you.

[00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:23.822]  Many anthropologists and archaeologists believe that before man even discovered the power to harness and use fire, we were involved in agrarian activities.
[00:15:24.283 --> 00:15:29.044]  That is, taking the seeds of plants and then replanting them to produce more.
[00:15:29.684 --> 00:15:38.667]  The very foundation of our modern civilization and human culture is centered around the planting and cultivation of edible plants.
[00:15:39.207 --> 00:15:44.050]  Here are some of the amazing deals at InfoWarsSeedCenter at InfoWarsShop.com.

[00:16:06.646 --> 00:16:07.227]  And remember,
[00:16:08.088 --> 00:16:10.476]  The revolution against tyranny is growing.
[00:16:44.622 --> 00:16:44.722]  Oh!
[00:16:45.383 --> 00:16:45.723]  Superman!
[00:16:45.743 --> 00:16:46.003]  It's Connor!
[00:16:51.527 --> 00:16:52.828]  Looks pretty cool, doesn't it?
[00:16:53.308 --> 00:16:58.392]  The things we can do with modern technology, such as the drone that made that viral YouTube video.
[00:16:58.952 --> 00:17:03.475]  But just like much of our modern technologies, drones are ripe for abuse.
[00:17:04.095 --> 00:17:07.398]  When is a drone picture
[00:17:08.118 --> 00:17:09.559]  A benefit to society.
[00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:11.740]  When does it become stalking?
[00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:13.722]  When does it invade privacy?
[00:17:13.902 --> 00:17:15.943]  How close to a home can a drone go?
[00:17:15.963 --> 00:17:22.267]  I'm in my home and there's a demonstration out front and I go to peek out the window and there's a drone facing me.
[00:17:23.088 --> 00:17:27.911]  Well, whoever was running it turned it around quickly and it crashed.
[00:17:28.271 --> 00:17:36.977]  I'm not sure why anyone would want to peek in the window of Senator Feinstein, but regardless, I'm glad the Senator is at least speaking out about the issue of privacy.
[00:17:37.157 --> 00:17:39.819]  She had previously said that it's okay to spy on U.S.
[00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:43.482]  citizens and may now be rethinking her choice of words.
[00:17:44.142 --> 00:17:50.966]  Don't get me wrong though, there are plenty of harmless uses for a drone, such as land surveying or making YouTube videos.
[00:17:51.546 --> 00:17:54.988]  But when does that become a violation of someone's privacy?
[00:17:55.388 --> 00:18:00.871]  For example, is it an illegal search and seizure if police fly a drone over someone's property?
[00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:06.074]  The mayor of Seattle seems to think so, but there are plenty of other cities that would disagree.
[00:18:06.474 --> 00:18:10.678]  Deputies can fly this 50-pound Shadowhawk unmanned helicopter.
[00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:19.087]  A powerful camera on the front is controlled with this game-like console and the manufacturer says this one's even designed to carry weapons.
[00:18:19.147 --> 00:18:26.314]  You have a stun baton where you can actually engage somebody at altitude with the aircraft and a stun baton will essentially disable a suspect.
[00:18:26.534 --> 00:18:27.055]  Predator drones.
[00:18:27.075 --> 00:18:28.115]  You will never see it coming.
[00:18:47.133 --> 00:18:50.315]  We've seen how inaccurate lethal drones have been overseas.
[00:18:50.695 --> 00:18:52.356]  They've even killed US citizens.
[00:18:52.916 --> 00:18:56.899]  So why on earth would anyone want to bring these things to the states?
[00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:02.342]  It is great to see American machines helping to promote peace abroad.
[00:19:02.682 --> 00:19:09.526]  So then tell me, why can't we use these machines here at home?
[00:19:09.546 --> 00:19:13.268]  Why is America so robo-phobic?
[00:19:14.016 --> 00:19:22.067]  So in closing, if you're innocently filming a class project or trying to find the best place to install a pool on your land, then go ahead.
[00:19:22.608 --> 00:19:27.114]  But remember, while we're busy watching YouTube videos, they're busy watching us.
[00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:30.619]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:38.829 --> 00:19:47.834]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:19:47.914 --> 00:19:56.158]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:19:56.338 --> 00:20:01.020]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:21:54.912 --> 00:21:59.554]  You've called in, you've let us know that you're having some tremendous results from Supermail.
[00:21:59.934 --> 00:22:03.315]  We're going on this journey together against this daily assault.
[00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:08.917]  This includes the estrogen mimickers, the BPAs in the plastics, all the pharmaceuticals in the water.
[00:22:09.577 --> 00:22:14.401]  We have answered your call with this super male vitality, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:14.701 --> 00:22:21.547]  It is formulated with eight key herbs that are absolutely essential to helping your body balance its natural hormone levels.
[00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:25.550]  And on this journey with us has been Shane Steiner.
[00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:33.156]  Now you're about two months in and we have seen an absolutely amazing transformation that you have gone through.
[00:22:33.196 --> 00:22:37.019]  We took some before and after pictures of you at five weeks in.
[00:22:37.079 --> 00:22:39.060]  That's what this draws out of you.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.902]  Yeah, for me, the results have been amazing.
[00:22:43.103 --> 00:22:52.368]  The stuff that's been happening to me, both physically and mentally, I'm just really happy to be here talking about it.
[00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:09.167]  So how do you feel looking at yourself at pictures from five weeks in and now?
[00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:14.790]  Well, at five weeks, I was, you know, just trying to add some mass, put on, you know, actually gain muscle.
[00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.632]  And so when I go to the gym, I would, you know, lift weights.
[00:23:19.592 --> 00:23:22.034]  I was doing heavy weight eight to ten times.
[00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:23.835]  And that's what you do to add mass.
[00:23:24.475 --> 00:23:26.636]  And then after I saw the pictures, I thought, you know what?
[00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:31.419]  I would like to maybe slim down a little bit, you know, get a little more cut up.
[00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:43.593]  So all I did was, you know, change up my diet a little bit and do some cardio and start lifting more like 15 to 20 reps when I do my workouts.
[00:23:43.653 --> 00:23:49.140]  And what it does, it just allows your body to respond to whatever you want to happen.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:24:00.566]  Exactly, because that's quite an issue that people will have at the gym is that they'll just constantly be trying to lift and they won't gain any muscle mass or they try to lose weight and they just can't seem to shed the pounds.
[00:24:00.987 --> 00:24:06.610]  This super male vitality has helped to sort of regulate that to respond quickly.
[00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:10.132]  Yeah, I didn't really know how bad it was for me until I started taking it.
[00:24:10.332 --> 00:24:16.416]  I mean, I was like most of the guys in the gym that you see in there that just work out every day.
[00:24:16.436 --> 00:24:17.717]  You see them in there just
[00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:22.290]  Working really hard and you never see them look any different.
[00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.751]  They just stay the same.
[00:24:24.451 --> 00:24:26.272]  Immediately, I just started getting results.
[00:24:26.312 --> 00:24:28.072]  Whatever I wanted to happen.
[00:24:28.472 --> 00:24:30.133]  If I wanted to gain weight, I was gaining weight.
[00:24:30.173 --> 00:24:33.534]  If I wanted to slim up, you know, it's been remarkable really.
[00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:42.501]  So in the original testimony video that Alex shot on his phone, you mentioned that you were going through some, the winter blaws, and that this sort of had a great effect on you.
[00:24:42.541 --> 00:24:44.041]  Can you expand on that a little bit?
[00:24:44.341 --> 00:24:46.381]  Yeah, that's the depression I was talking about.
[00:24:46.741 --> 00:24:52.863]  And even after taking it for a couple of weeks, I was already starting to kind of come out of that a little bit.
[00:24:53.883 --> 00:24:55.343]  Nothing compared to what I am now.
[00:24:55.503 --> 00:24:58.924]  I mean, I'm like a completely different person, even from when that was shot.
[00:24:59.924 --> 00:25:07.148]  And my sense of well-being, and my overall attitude, and just my ability to stay focused.
[00:25:07.408 --> 00:25:17.334]  Even having a conversation, before I would, you know, my brain would splinter off into a million different ways, and now I can, you know, actually finish a sentence.
[00:25:18.834 --> 00:25:32.137]  Yeah, I think a lot of us have that sort of a little bit of ADD here, where we are constantly multitasking, so we're having to be in so many different places, and it's hard to sort of pull this information from the ether.
[00:25:32.557 --> 00:25:35.357]  This actually helped me to have mental clarity as well.
[00:25:35.417 --> 00:25:40.578]  I felt it in my third eye when I first started taking it, so I know exactly what you're speaking about.
[00:25:40.758 --> 00:25:43.819]  I like to take it first thing in the morning to help me get going.
[00:25:44.719 --> 00:25:48.482]  And then I'll take it about 30 minutes before I know I'm going to go to the gym.
[00:25:49.363 --> 00:25:53.466]  And, you know, you pretty much have to make the decision to go to the gym yourself.
[00:25:53.526 --> 00:25:59.951]  But once you get there, that's when the real power kicks in, when you actually start to get moving.
[00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:02.333]  It says take two dropper fulls.
[00:26:02.853 --> 00:26:04.154]  I take three dropper fulls.
[00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:09.639]  But again, you probably want to consult a physician before you do that because it does
[00:26:10.768 --> 00:26:12.149]  Get the blood pumping.
[00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:17.310]  Well, the suggested use is approximately two droppers in the morning and one in the afternoon.
[00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:19.331]  So you're kind of doubling up on that.
[00:26:20.132 --> 00:26:25.454]  To go from that big to now having such lean muscle, the before and after shots are incredible.
[00:26:27.054 --> 00:26:28.595]  I don't have results like that in the gym.
[00:26:29.435 --> 00:26:37.478]  Well, honestly, because I see myself every day, I didn't know it was going to be that big of a difference.
[00:26:38.198 --> 00:26:39.799]  But I was actually surprised myself.
[00:26:40.504 --> 00:26:40.724]  Right.
[00:26:40.784 --> 00:26:41.885]  What does your wife think about it?
[00:26:42.125 --> 00:26:45.168]  Well, I mean, I'm having to go buy all different clothes now.
[00:26:45.348 --> 00:26:49.731]  She's having to go with me and go shopping a lot, so be prepared to buy new wardrobes.
[00:26:50.231 --> 00:26:52.633]  It's very rewarding to see results that fast, though.
[00:26:52.973 --> 00:26:53.454]  It really is.
[00:26:53.794 --> 00:26:58.417]  And, you know, having the right hormone balance, I'm amazed at how quickly
[00:26:59.483 --> 00:27:01.684]  My body has been responding to the changes.
[00:27:01.924 --> 00:27:11.248]  That's the key, because you can diet well and you can exercise and you can do all of those things, but if your hormones are not in balance, you're not going to have that proper response.
[00:27:11.688 --> 00:27:18.991]  As soon as you have testosterone that can build muscle, that's when you'll be able to put on solid, lean muscle.
[00:27:19.191 --> 00:27:27.094]  Exactly, and the testosterone is also really important for women that want to get in the gym and slim down and build a little bit of muscle without looking like a bodybuilder.
[00:27:27.654 --> 00:27:33.340]  Yeah, because what it does is it just helps your body produce what it naturally needs to.
[00:27:33.881 --> 00:27:37.084]  So it's not like adding synthetic testosterone.
[00:27:37.444 --> 00:27:37.805]  You're right.
[00:27:38.225 --> 00:27:47.035]  To gain muscle and stuff, women do produce small amounts of testosterone, but all it's going to do is bring up the levels to where they need to be.
[00:27:47.651 --> 00:27:48.271]  Right, exactly.
[00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:51.592]  Well, we've got such a major assault coming at us in every way.
[00:27:51.712 --> 00:28:06.135]  We've already got increased levels of estrogen and now there's even more estrogen being, synthetic estrogens, being put our way to where women are getting now breast cancer and all sorts of ovarian cancer, cancers that weren't even around in the past.
[00:28:06.535 --> 00:28:12.557]  So we have this formulation here that helps to block those estrogen mimickers and it is going to help.
[00:28:12.637 --> 00:28:14.097]  I mean, obviously, it's sort of a
[00:28:14.597 --> 00:28:14.697]  Yes.
[00:28:32.702 --> 00:28:34.444]  I'm in such a good mood now all the time.
[00:28:34.984 --> 00:28:44.573]  Honestly, I'm really glad that Alex talked me into taking this because I've tried all kinds of products and they just never do what they say.
[00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:46.174]  This one actually does more.
[00:28:46.634 --> 00:28:48.196]  I've just been having great results with it.
[00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:53.100]  And mostly because of my attitude and the way I feel about things.
[00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:55.323]  That is great.
[00:28:55.623 --> 00:28:57.986]  Some people it will affect differently than it's affected me.
[00:28:58.908 --> 00:29:03.655]  And, you know, like we've said before, Alex Jones can fly when he takes this, so... Take some focus.
[00:29:04.436 --> 00:29:05.737]  Up, up, and away!
[00:29:07.765 --> 00:29:08.565]  Results may vary.
[00:29:08.906 --> 00:29:09.166]  Right.
[00:29:09.226 --> 00:29:21.091]  Well, I guess, too, it also just depends on how out of balance your hormones are, what your diet is like, what sort of things you're doing in your daily routine to assist these herbs that are working in your body.
[00:29:21.171 --> 00:29:25.033]  And you've just really taken it to the extreme and said, I'm dedicating myself to this.
[00:29:25.413 --> 00:29:26.193]  I'm going to go to the gym.
[00:29:26.233 --> 00:29:28.854]  I'm going to eat right and work with this product.
[00:29:28.874 --> 00:29:29.274]  That's right.
[00:29:29.395 --> 00:29:31.535]  If you're balanced, then your health will be better.
[00:29:31.596 --> 00:29:36.958]  If nothing else, you'll feel better and you will have a better mental clarity.
[00:29:37.563 --> 00:29:38.284]  Right, absolutely.
[00:29:38.304 --> 00:29:47.213]  Well, I know for myself, this has actually just improved my ability to just have a little bit of clarity, a little bit of pep in my step, if you will.
[00:29:47.714 --> 00:29:53.119]  But thank you so much for sharing your journey with us, and I guess we're going to have to have you in here for the next phase.
[00:29:53.139 --> 00:29:54.441]  Yeah, another five weeks, who hasn't?
[00:29:54.481 --> 00:29:54.901]  Yeah!
[00:29:55.422 --> 00:29:56.643]  Well, that's it for the show tonight.
[00:29:56.703 --> 00:29:59.426]  We will see you all here again at 7 p.m.
[00:29:59.506 --> 00:29:59.967]  Central.
[00:30:06.069 --> 00:30:09.450]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.790]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:20.352]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:30:20.612 --> 00:30:23.932]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:30:24.092 --> 00:30:34.434]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:30:34.734 --> 00:30:42.016]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:44.117]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:30:44.457 --> 00:30:52.039]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:58.562]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
