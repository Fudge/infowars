[00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:06.226]  I'm going to cover this and take your calls.
[00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:10.388]  School teaches kids the government gives us rights, close quote.
[00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:14.450]  God-given freedoms are in fact special privileges, close quote.
[00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.371]  Granted by the state, says handout.
[00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:20.573]  Hey, cops knew 30 years ago that driving wasn't a privilege.
[00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:21.594]  Now they'll tell you it's a privilege.
[00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:23.395]  They're now saying guns are a privilege.
[00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:24.335]  It's not true.
[00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:27.817]  I'm going to explain that coming up in a moment.
[00:00:28.277 --> 00:00:29.558]  It says being a good citizen.
[00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.516]  Emma, the little girl, filled that out.
[00:00:32.536 --> 00:00:33.176]  Isn't that cute?
[00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:35.077]  We'll be covering that in a moment.
[00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:38.319]  Also, two GOP presidents acted unilaterally on immigration.
[00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.419]  AP saying that's why Obama can do it.
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.920]  No.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.341]  I told you the Republicans are behind this.
[00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:44.861]  The Blue Bloods.
[00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:47.383]  But when Reagan did it, he had congressional approval.
[00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:49.904]  And so then he did it executively.
[00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.966]  And the same thing with another president, George H.W.
[00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:54.166]  Bush.
[00:00:55.325 --> 00:01:01.146]  It only encouraged more people to come and then more amnesty, so we're against that too, even though it was much smaller.
[00:01:01.407 --> 00:01:03.707]  Just because Republicans did something bad doesn't mean it's okay.
[00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:06.108]  Just because Democrats did something bad doesn't mean it's okay.
[00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:11.209]  But you watch, when Republicans get in, they're going to say, oh look, Obama did all this, just as we said they would.
[00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.011]  It doesn't set a precedent when you commit a crime to be able to keep committing more crimes unless we let you do it.
[00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.111]  And we're saying we're done.
[00:01:21.892 --> 00:01:23.172]  Joining us from Ferguson,
[00:01:24.472 --> 00:01:31.896]  That would be an understatement, Alex.
[00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:33.517]  It's about 20 degrees here.
[00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:35.018]  It is pretty cold, yes.
[00:01:35.898 --> 00:01:51.447]  We're actually standing outside, if you see the flag in the background waving around, we're standing right outside of the courthouse in Clayton, Missouri, and that's where the verdict is supposed to come down either today or tomorrow sometime this week, but it looks like it'll be tonight.
[00:01:52.069 --> 00:02:08.263]  Uh, on the verdict of whether or not Darren Wilson is found guilty of the murder of Mike Brown, uh, just a little bit ago, there were some protesters, uh, walking around, uh, through the streets, and, uh, immediately, a bunch of cop cars went right behind them, followed them down the road, and, uh, you know, tell them the whole way.
[00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:11.727]  Uh, that's starting to, uh, dissipate a bit, and everyone's starting to move out.
[00:02:12.067 --> 00:02:15.330]  Other than that, there's not a lot of people out on the streets right now.
[00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.732]  I think a lot of people are kind of, you know,
[00:02:19.482 --> 00:02:21.843]  Taking heed to the fact that something might happen.
[00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:30.105]  I mean, there's a pretty good chance from what you see that the buzz on social media, you know, saying, hey, if you board your windows up, that's not going to stop us.
[00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:31.506]  We'll just burn your building down.
[00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.287]  So there's a lot of tension going on around this area.
[00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:40.109]  And, you know, Clayton's only to the east, I'd say about a 20 minute drive from the downtown St.
[00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:44.190]  Louis area and about a 15 minute drive south of Ferguson.
[00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.270]  But this is where the St.
[00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.431]  Louis County Police Department's headquarters is.
[00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.591]  In the courthouse.
[00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:53.915]  So, this is where the action will begin if the verdict is released tonight.
[00:02:54.215 --> 00:03:00.140]  And, you know, like we say too, you know, NHL, Stanley Cup Finals, someone wins, they still riot.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.885]  So regardless, people are expecting to go crazy out here, and we're going to be here to document that for you guys to watch at home.
[00:03:07.657 --> 00:03:26.591]  That's right, you guys had hundreds of thousands of viewers at one time when you were doing live Ustreams that we had up on Infowars.com when Jakari got hit by the gas, you got hit by rubber bullets, they attacked the Al Jazeera camera people and then said they were helping them, then the police officer threatened to effing kill you with a shotgun for no reason.
[00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:27.531]  He got suspended.
[00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:32.715]  We're not here trying to get cops in trouble, but we have a right to be out there covering it.
[00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:36.078]  You went up and told them where the cache of Moloff cocktails were.
[00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:37.599]  I don't know.
[00:03:54.477 --> 00:04:00.639]  And it's one thing to say, hey, don't follow orders like Nuremberg, but at the same time, there's a lot of peer pressure.
[00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.960]  What is your gut telling you is going to happen when this announcement comes out?
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.702]  I know a lot of the groups have said they're still going to riot, even if they indict the cop.
[00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:14.003]  Yeah, well, my biggest fear is this time is the the agent provocateur.
[00:04:14.403 --> 00:04:18.525]  I think there's going to be a lot more undercover DHS employees.
[00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:22.006]  I've had one that maybe some National Guard
[00:04:22.654 --> 00:04:22.994]  I think so.
[00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:50.098]  You know, and state they're a militarized police state and lock us down again like martial law.
[00:04:50.418 --> 00:05:03.768]  You know, some people I know that, you know, do a lot of the computer stuff sent me a grid where it shows an outline of them, basically like a grid around the surrounding area where cops are going to be stationing.
[00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:12.814]  Uh, tonight possibly, and then closing in on everyone and locking it down, so... So you were sent by one of your sources the inside police perimeter grid.
[00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:17.395]  Will you please get that to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com or to Paul Watson, or one of the riders?
[00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:18.416]  That's big news, Joe.
[00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:20.497]  Yeah, I just got that earlier.
[00:05:21.017 --> 00:05:27.539]  So, right now, that kind of coincides with the fact that those DHS vehicles... You got a peddling map, is what you're saying.
[00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.220]  You got the map of how they're going to control people.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.782]  Yeah, they want to take that area, lock it down, and start pushing through like they did.
[00:05:34.457 --> 00:05:36.580]  Except this time it's going to be a much larger area.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.944]  But we know that they've brought in over 2,000 outside police officers.
[00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:43.228]  You know, we've seen the pictures of all those DHS vehicles.
[00:05:43.788 --> 00:05:50.156]  You know, over the past couple weeks, there's been multiple Apache helicopter sightings in the area that have never been seen.
[00:05:52.842 --> 00:05:59.969]  And by the way, last year they sent in the armored vehicles, the tanks, and said this was a preparation for civil unrest.
[00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.213]  Bizarre that they sent it to that very area, all over St.
[00:06:04.253 --> 00:06:11.700]  Louis, south and north, but near Ferguson as well, and did the training for martial law, and then magically this pops up there.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.223]  Again, the average cop who's compartmentalized doesn't know this, but we know
[00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:29.346]  From the Trayvon Martin case, it came out in mainstream Florida news that indeed the Justice Department was caught running the meetings, advising people to go out and loot Walgreens and to riot, trying to get it to blow up.
[00:06:29.386 --> 00:06:36.848]  Then the feds can come in when local cops respond, say they did something wrong, and set the precedent for federalization.
[00:06:37.108 --> 00:06:38.708]  This is all about federalization.
[00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:42.269]  That's why the feds want there to be riots all over the country.
[00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:44.849]  It's why MSNBC and others race bait
[00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.271]  With their FBI informant, of course, Al Sharpton.
[00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:51.292]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:58.335]  You know, a lot of the people around here that I've spoken to thus far, a lot of people are worried that something like this is going to happen.
[00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:07.359]  You know, when I spoke to the gun store owner the other day, he said most of the people that were coming in were families of the police officers that work in the St.
[00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:08.560]  Louis County Police Department.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.302]  So they're worried about the retaliation against police officers and their families as well.
[00:07:13.618 --> 00:07:15.260]  So those people are in fear for their lives.
[00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:24.312]  You know, you got a lot of protesters or antagonizers, whatever you want to call them, running around saying that, you know, that if you're white, you've got a good chance of being killed or shot.
[00:07:24.332 --> 00:07:26.155]  I mean, here's my problem.
[00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:27.937]  I don't care if you're black or white or what color you are.
[00:07:27.957 --> 00:07:29.600]  You threaten me, I'm going to get real mad.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:38.985]  And listen, all these gangbangers need to know, the citizens are all armed to the teeth, and I don't know what they think is going to happen if they try to go to some cop's house and kill people.
[00:07:39.485 --> 00:07:51.131]  I mean, this is going to get really nasty, and then if it blows up here, I think Obama, who's behind the scenes trying to stir this up, he's been caught once a race war, that could be his only surprise now in his last two years of office.
[00:07:51.151 --> 00:07:52.732]  I think it's a very serious situation.
[00:07:52.752 --> 00:07:55.173]  Well, I mean, he's trying to pass this amnesty bill.
[00:07:55.533 --> 00:08:02.042]  So it turns the Hispanic voter against the Republicans so he can, you know, have the Hispanic voter on the Democrat side.
[00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.987]  So, I mean, this is all a race war at the end of the day.
[00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:06.352]  Exactly.
[00:08:06.392 --> 00:08:10.436]  The problem is, Hispanic Americans in the polls aren't for open borders.
[00:08:10.956 --> 00:08:15.441]  In fact, I saw a poll where 31% of Democrats are supporting it, and that's dropping every day.
[00:08:15.902 --> 00:08:21.968]  If you're a Hispanic American, how does bringing 40 million unskilled people... I mean, we used to get skilled people from Mexico.
[00:08:22.228 --> 00:08:22.949]  At least they work.
[00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.270]  A lot of Americans are spoiled.
[00:08:24.691 --> 00:08:27.113]  So yeah, I mean, I'll grant it that...
[00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:32.665]  You know, Mexican laborers, carpenters, folks work their butts off are good people on average.
[00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.547]  The problem is now Latin America is collapsing.
[00:08:35.907 --> 00:08:38.509]  All the welfare queens from down there weigh 500 pounds.
[00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:39.470]  I'm not being mean.
[00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:44.434]  You know, 6X underwear, that's who's showing up are unaccompanied kids.
[00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:46.696]  This is a total drain on the system.
[00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:49.558]  We have high unemployment.
[00:08:50.058 --> 00:08:53.241]  If we had 100% or 98% employment, bring in foreigners.
[00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:54.402]  We don't need it.
[00:08:54.462 --> 00:08:55.983]  It's bad for the country.
[00:08:58.097 --> 00:08:58.797]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:59.058 --> 00:09:00.639]  And this stuff's not going to help at all either.
[00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:19.652]  I mean, you know, they're expecting things in Atlanta to pop off as well, Chicago, LA, and New York, you know, because after the initial protests that Jakari and Josh Owens and Marcos and I were at originally, you know, that was sparking protests all across the country.
[00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:25.656]  But if violence breaks out here, this sets a precedent for all these other big cities across the country.
[00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:30.586]  And a lot of people are going to follow in those steps just like they did back in August with the hands up, don't shoot thing.
[00:09:30.887 --> 00:09:38.231]  Now, once they start burning buildings down and they start attacking people who are innocent, walking up and down the street because of the color of their skin, it's going to happen everywhere.
[00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:39.391]  We're going to have a huge problem.
[00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:44.654]  And then you're going to see martial law just being locked down everywhere in all these major cities.
[00:09:45.074 --> 00:09:46.035]  It's going to be crazy.
[00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:52.118]  You know, people need to prepare for the worst, expect the best, but at the same time, you know,
[00:09:52.938 --> 00:09:54.139]  Just be smart about it.
[00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:57.200]  I mean, you know, being out here today, this is a pretty busy area.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.001]  We were out here yesterday driving around.
[00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:00.782]  There's a lot of people out walking around.
[00:10:00.822 --> 00:10:02.743]  Today, it's pretty dead.
[00:10:02.783 --> 00:10:07.045]  I think a lot of people are taking the threat seriously, and they're waiting to see what happens tonight.
[00:10:07.246 --> 00:10:08.206]  What about the bad weather?
[00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:13.869]  I was hoping bad weather, when the verdict came out, would keep people from going crazy.
[00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:15.870]  That's not going to happen at all.
[00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.651]  The people are still showing up.
[00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:19.012]  There's still talk on Twitter.
[00:10:19.272 --> 00:10:20.552]  You know, I found a lot of the people who
[00:10:22.105 --> 00:10:34.417]  Organize a lot of these protests for the area and coordinate a lot of that stuff and it from the you know The chatter I've seen on Twitter not one person is gonna be stopped by the weather whatsoever They're determined to come out here have their voices be heard
[00:10:34.793 --> 00:10:41.576]  And if they have to, in their opinions, get violent with the police and burn down buildings to get their point across, the snow will not stop them.
[00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:42.296]  Well, I'll say this.
[00:10:42.336 --> 00:10:43.276]  I've studied the law.
[00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:46.237]  When the police shoot our reporters rubber bullets, that's criminal.
[00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:48.678]  That's a felony attack on the First Amendment.
[00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:56.321]  But when so-called demonstrators on Twitter and Facebook say they're going to kill cops or burn things down, that is felonies as well.
[00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:58.002]  We need to get our reporters
[00:10:59.315 --> 00:11:05.360]  To go look at those, I've seen those myself, do articles, and say, why aren't the police arresting people calling for violence?
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:16.248]  Because you have a First Amendment, until you say, let's all meet up at the corner of, you know, 6th Street and Lavaca and, you know, attack stuff, hypothetically, in Austin.
[00:11:17.008 --> 00:11:23.473]  I mean, if I said that, they should hear that, it's probable cause, you don't even need a warrant, come arrest me!
[00:11:24.074 --> 00:11:28.177]  I mean, if I got on air and said, go kill people, go burn things down, let's go,
[00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:29.978]  Yeah, they would have been knocking on the door.
[00:11:30.258 --> 00:11:31.359]  Well, that's what you should do.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.782]  I mean, if I see somebody organizing to go kill somebody, I'm going to call the police.
[00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:43.270]  I mean, this is outrageous that they let Al-Qaeda and all these other groups, I notice, ISIS recruit on Facebook and Twitter, but our stuff gets censored.
[00:11:43.928 --> 00:11:54.032]  The funny thing is though is that we've got this whole buzz in the air that the KKK is going to be out here and that's another thing to incite violence and to piss off a lot of these people.
[00:11:54.072 --> 00:11:59.975]  You should go out and, I forgot that angle, ask locals if they know that most of the time these KKK demonstrations...
[00:12:01.476 --> 00:12:07.360]  You can print off like Orlando Sentinel, FBI, clan leader, FBI leader.
[00:12:07.621 --> 00:12:09.522]  It's not like they're in the group to watch them.
[00:12:09.782 --> 00:12:16.588]  They organize, they lead them, and it turns out the entire leadership will be feds or Southern Poverty Law Center to get stuff going.
[00:12:17.148 --> 00:12:28.017]  If you Google the man who's saying he is the head of the KKK area around here, Frank Ancona, the first two things that pop up on Google are his name on the FBI death list.
[00:12:29.974 --> 00:12:30.614]  What does that mean?
[00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:35.218]  People that are no longer alive that the FBI is dealing with.
[00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.220]  Oh yeah, I know that guy from Missouri.
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.141]  It turned out he wasn't informant.
[00:12:39.181 --> 00:12:39.682]  I saw that.
[00:12:39.982 --> 00:12:42.223]  But also a white supremacist leader and he's supposedly dead.
[00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.466]  Yes, he's on the FBI kill or dead list.
[00:12:45.766 --> 00:12:53.112]  And then, you know, some of these other people that have popped up, you know, the anonymous group put out a list of all the KKK members they found in this area.
[00:12:53.392 --> 00:12:55.634]  A lot of them are supposedly police officers,
[00:12:56.038 --> 00:12:58.160]  Well see that's the problem with anonymous.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.361]  Anonymous is anonymous.
[00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:01.863]  So sometimes it's good people, sometimes it's bad people.
[00:13:02.143 --> 00:13:03.364]  Anybody can use that name.
[00:13:04.965 --> 00:13:06.466]  Look folks, the PSYOP's in.
[00:13:06.846 --> 00:13:08.768]  We're trying to de-escalate the situation.
[00:13:09.268 --> 00:13:11.250]  Other people are trying to escalate the situation.
[00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:18.175]  The fact that there aren't arrests being made of these violent Facebook and Twitters is simply outrageous.
[00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:19.376]  These are terroristic threats.
[00:13:19.776 --> 00:13:21.698]  These are organizing criminal activity.
[00:13:22.018 --> 00:13:23.199]  This is racketeering.
[00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:23.920]  It's illegal.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.502]  And it makes good protesting look bad is why the feds are in it.
[00:13:27.602 --> 00:13:30.524]  I guarantee you it's the Justice Department quarterbacking this.
[00:13:30.824 --> 00:13:35.847]  We're going to skip this one network break so we can talk to Jakari Jackson and go to phone calls ahead of John Rappaport.
[00:13:36.447 --> 00:13:42.211]  Rhonda in Hawaii, Angela, Shamus, Ryan and Indico Kid will go to all of you.
[00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:45.613]  Thank you Joe Biggs for your courage to be there reporting this.
[00:13:45.973 --> 00:13:50.156]  You guys stay dry and stay focused and just keep filing reports.
[00:13:50.176 --> 00:13:50.676]  Great job.
[00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.457]  If you need somebody in Mexico, I'm there.
[00:13:54.005 --> 00:13:54.846]  You want to go to Mexico?
[00:13:55.446 --> 00:13:56.146]  I'll go anywhere.
[00:13:56.907 --> 00:13:58.228]  Well, it's going on the next few days.
[00:13:58.248 --> 00:13:58.848]  I've got to decide.
[00:13:58.868 --> 00:13:59.789]  But I know you like that.
[00:13:59.849 --> 00:14:01.130]  But you don't want to go to Mexico City.
[00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.951]  They say there's nothing more hellish.
[00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:04.973]  But it's also pretty in some ways.
[00:14:05.013 --> 00:14:06.954]  But we'll figure it out, Joe.
[00:14:06.994 --> 00:14:07.434]  Great job.
[00:14:07.454 --> 00:14:08.315]  Let me talk to Jakari.
[00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:08.695]  Thank you.
[00:14:09.075 --> 00:14:09.296]  All right.
[00:14:09.336 --> 00:14:16.881]  That's Joe Biggs from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq to Ferguson and the border and the rest of it.
[00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:19.543]  One of our investigative journalists there on the ground.
[00:14:20.683 --> 00:14:22.204]  I can see his teeth are chattering.
[00:14:22.604 --> 00:14:25.985]  So I want to get this interview with Jakari done and let them get back to a warm area.
[00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:32.148]  We could do it from the hotel rooms, but it looks better to have them out there in the snow-covered park across from the courthouse.
[00:14:32.568 --> 00:14:34.009]  Two great reporters and a great team.
[00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:39.312]  People keep asking why I send Jakari and Joe out together with Josh Owens when he can go.
[00:14:39.672 --> 00:14:40.612]  He's not there right now.
[00:14:41.393 --> 00:14:42.733]  It's because they work as a great team.
[00:14:43.914 --> 00:14:46.475]  Jakari, please don't freeze to death, my friend.
[00:14:47.424 --> 00:14:48.665]  I'm doing my best, Alex.
[00:14:48.725 --> 00:14:51.507]  I'm pretty layered up, but it is really cold out here.
[00:14:51.527 --> 00:14:54.828]  It's Gary Jackson reporting from Clayton, Missouri.
[00:14:54.848 --> 00:15:01.412]  Like Joe said, if you're just now joining us, we're right in front of the courthouse where they expect to hear the verdict on Officer Wilson.
[00:15:01.432 --> 00:15:08.497]  There are some people out here protesting earlier today, and I don't want everybody to lose the fact that there are peaceful protesters out here, peaceful demonstrators.
[00:15:09.037 --> 00:15:14.180]  They just recently finished, but you have peaceful people who are walking around just saying, hey, we want to find out what's going on.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.881]  We want to get to the bottom of the situation.
[00:15:16.226 --> 00:15:24.292]  You know, I know we hear a lot about the people threatening to burn things down and loot things, but we also have the peaceful people who just want to find out what's going on in their community.
[00:15:25.232 --> 00:15:33.518]  Well, that's why the feds are infiltrating and trying to radicalize things, because they can demonize demonstrations while acting like they're the saviors from the local police.
[00:15:33.578 --> 00:15:35.619]  What's your take on the overall PSYOP?
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.763]  Well, I think thus far, you know, it's been a real strong divide.
[00:15:41.904 --> 00:15:45.066]  They managed to get that racial divide in here pretty early, because we see
[00:15:46.055 --> 00:15:46.656]  I don't know.
[00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:29.106]  Questions a lot of speculation about what happened to Mike Brown and by the way, they indicted those cops But they got off and they really shouldn't have gotten off They should have gotten some prison time and of course notice that guy's dad was a cop So she cops are having their sons killed by crazy cops Yeah, I mean you're not safe from the system and like we were out here the original time back in August And I was talking to some of the SWAT officers I was like, you know your kids have to live in this country, too You know, so one day they want to come out here and protest about something
[00:16:29.771 --> 00:16:31.332]  They think it's wrong or they think it's right.
[00:16:31.672 --> 00:16:33.153]  You know, they have to deal with this police force.
[00:16:33.173 --> 00:16:39.236]  They have to deal with officers pointing rifles at them for just being in a crowd on a street in the United States of America.
[00:16:39.776 --> 00:16:41.817]  So hopefully the cool heads will prevail.
[00:16:41.877 --> 00:16:42.417]  Go ahead, Alex.
[00:16:42.597 --> 00:16:50.281]  What was it like for you when they were aiming M4s with real bullets at you when you're doing nothing and Joe's doing nothing?
[00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:53.222]  And then they're letting rioters operate a block away.
[00:16:53.602 --> 00:16:58.625]  Why do you think they were able to get the cops to just have such hatred for the press?
[00:17:00.146 --> 00:17:03.187]  I think, you know what it is, a lot of it, they didn't want the story to be told.
[00:17:03.267 --> 00:17:09.469]  Because the footage that we got, the first night we got here, because Mike got shot on a Saturday, I believe it was, we got here that following Tuesday.
[00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.110]  And, you know, they're aiming guns at people in the crowd.
[00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:14.311]  And as far as I know, we broke that story.
[00:17:14.331 --> 00:17:16.272]  You know, they're putting laser dots on people's chests.
[00:17:16.652 --> 00:17:26.836]  And even though there are some local news outlets out there, I didn't see that on any local news, that there are aiming guns at people in the crowd until, you know, a couple days later when, you know, CNN and the rest of the big boys came out here to play.
[00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.462]  So, you know, they don't want the press to get the story out.
[00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:31.262]  Of course, Al Jazeera, everybody knows that.
[00:17:31.282 --> 00:17:32.543]  I was right there when it happened.
[00:17:32.803 --> 00:17:36.264]  You know, they have the cameras, they have the lights set up, yelling, press, press.
[00:17:36.284 --> 00:17:37.805]  And I said, mama, they don't care that you press.
[00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:38.445]  They want to shoot you.
[00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:41.226]  So, you know, you have to be concerned about things like that.
[00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:42.927]  Will it continue tonight?
[00:17:43.087 --> 00:17:43.447]  I don't know.
[00:17:43.507 --> 00:17:46.968]  Thus far, we have not had any conflicts with the police.
[00:17:46.988 --> 00:17:48.569]  There are multiple police agencies out here.
[00:17:48.589 --> 00:17:54.871]  This is where the county police are, but some of the smaller towns, they all have their cars rolling around here just in case something happens.
[00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:56.932]  So, we'll be here to report it.
[00:17:56.972 --> 00:18:01.213]  Hopefully, we won't have any static like we did last time, but we do have the Infidel body armor.
[00:18:01.233 --> 00:18:04.874]  We're definitely thankful for that in case, well, they start shooting at us again.
[00:18:04.894 --> 00:18:06.895]  In case they pulled out some live ordnance.
[00:18:06.915 --> 00:18:10.016]  You know, of course, Joe Biggs got shot last time with a rubber bullet.
[00:18:10.036 --> 00:18:12.816]  And then, Joe, didn't they come out and say they didn't shoot any rubber bullets?
[00:18:13.917 --> 00:18:18.018]  They came out and said that in a press release by the St.
[00:18:18.058 --> 00:18:19.158]  Louis County Police that
[00:18:19.525 --> 00:18:25.907]  No rubber bullets were fired, no CS gas was used, no flashbangs, no baton rounds, and here we are.
[00:18:26.068 --> 00:18:29.289]  Even though you picked up dozens of them, big ol' .50 caliber ones.
[00:18:29.689 --> 00:18:34.911]  Whoever's in my office, in the reporter room, I have on my desk a CS canister.
[00:18:35.151 --> 00:18:36.471]  Picked that up, run it into Alex.
[00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:40.393]  Because we brought that back from Ferguson, Missouri, but they said that was never used.
[00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:43.074]  The rubber bullets that Joe has, they said...
[00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:53.847]  I had to retweet a whole bunch of pictures on Twitter, and it's now gone viral because everyone's saying, oh, maybe they didn't use it, and I had to go and publish them again to show what's being used because they're still lying.
[00:18:53.927 --> 00:18:54.687]  It's November.
[00:18:54.947 --> 00:18:55.867]  This happened in August.
[00:18:55.907 --> 00:18:58.127]  They still have the gall to lie about it again.
[00:18:58.247 --> 00:18:59.168]  Yeah, they're lying about it.
[00:18:59.268 --> 00:19:00.868]  And remember the night I got tear gas?
[00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:06.309]  We all got tear gas, and they came out to all the people who were in the free speech zone and said, that's not tear gas.
[00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:13.330]  And then, and some of the greatest footage that you'll never see on CNN, me and Joe, we had to run like three miles
[00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:16.102]  I was like, you guys are a bunch of cowards.
[00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:17.744]  You're not reporting the truth.
[00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:44.881]  I'm like, you guys need to be real Americans, do your job as a journalist, report what's going on, stop lying for these police officers, stop lying for the government, and tell them that you're using these baton rounds.
[00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:47.943]  Let them know that you're shooting at journalists with rubber bullets.
[00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:52.006]  Well, I was about to say, how can they cover up Ebola cases we know are in the U.S.?
[00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:53.066]  They're disappearing people.
[00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:57.109]  Because the Forbes writer said they all met and agreed before the press conference to lie.
[00:19:57.449 --> 00:19:58.470]  And that was even in Forbes.
[00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.732]  And confirming what we have eyewitnesses,
[00:20:02.532 --> 00:20:04.833]  And how do they cover up they're busing the illegals in?
[00:20:04.873 --> 00:20:05.573]  Hold on, Alex.
[00:20:05.613 --> 00:20:06.994]  We have a gentleman.
[00:20:07.014 --> 00:20:07.674]  Come on in here, sir.
[00:20:08.294 --> 00:20:10.575]  Now, tell us what you were just telling us when you walked up here.
[00:20:11.096 --> 00:20:14.077]  Well, I happened to observe a gentleman when he was speaking.
[00:20:14.157 --> 00:20:21.440]  I say, I can't believe that I finna walk to my truck and all the journalists and the newscasters that I ran into, they just been telling falsehood.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.401]  They just steady lying, covering up for one another.
[00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:30.264]  And I can't believe that they steady, steady asking questions like, what gonna happen after the verdict?
[00:20:30.304 --> 00:20:30.964]  And it's such and such.
[00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:32.745]  Everybody know what's going on.
[00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:37.847]  Everybody know from the governor down what's going on, the cover-up, and why they're doing what they're doing.
[00:20:38.387 --> 00:20:44.609]  To me, to be honest with you, I honestly think they're trying to incite a riot in St.
[00:20:44.629 --> 00:20:45.330]  Louis, Missouri.
[00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.050]  I guess it's for revenue purposes.
[00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.311]  I don't know what it's for, but I can say this.
[00:20:49.989 --> 00:20:50.710]  What they doing?
[00:20:51.230 --> 00:21:06.760]  It's uncaused for us, it's unjustice, and they stay in line because they want, they say it never was a call that came across the radio, was the officer approached the gentleman in the streets, and now 101 days later, you're saying that it was a call that came across the radio.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.560]  So what is the truth?
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.781]  You know, the truth don't need no support.
[00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:12.163]  And one thing about it, I'm glad that these gentlemen out here
[00:21:13.257 --> 00:21:20.261]  Expressing the truth, doing what needs to be done, and shame on all the other newscasters that's in St.
[00:21:20.281 --> 00:21:27.965]  Louis, Missouri, the reporters that's not putting out the truth, and you got to deal with that consequence yourself, because the blood is on everybody's hands.
[00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:28.485]  Absolutely.
[00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:29.326]  Ask him his name.
[00:21:29.346 --> 00:21:30.146]  If you choose to lie.
[00:21:30.186 --> 00:21:30.786]  What's your name, sir?
[00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:32.307]  My name is Andre Anderson.
[00:21:32.587 --> 00:21:33.548]  All right, good to talk to you.
[00:21:33.648 --> 00:21:34.448]  Steady lion.
[00:21:34.829 --> 00:21:35.849]  That's a good word to describe it.
[00:21:36.089 --> 00:21:38.150]  Jakari, we'll check in with you on the nightly news tonight.
[00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:40.132]  BreakingReportsInfoWorks.com.
[00:21:40.152 --> 00:21:40.772]  Fabulous job.
[00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:42.221]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:21:42.502 --> 00:21:43.282]  Thank you, Jakari.
[00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:46.024]  All right, folks, we're going to end this hour, come back, take some more calls.
[00:21:47.064 --> 00:21:51.367]  We're going to hold Rappaport until I'm done with Rhonda, Chad, Shamus, Ryan, Indico, Kibbe.
[00:21:51.387 --> 00:21:56.050]  We should get to him about 15 after or so on the Global Sterilization Program.
[00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.732]  We're just trying to report all sides and the facts wherever they take us.
[00:22:00.833 --> 00:22:02.654]  And that's what we're doing here at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:05.034 --> 00:22:06.054]  We are selling out.
[00:22:06.915 --> 00:22:19.660]  In fact, I think it'll be sold out by tomorrow of the Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, and it looks like it'll be about two weeks till more of that is out, and we will be sold out in the next few days of Secret 12.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:27.103]  We were able to get a little bit more of an N that'll be in next week, so I don't call that backordered, but we are officially sold out of what's in stock.
[00:22:28.183 --> 00:22:28.543]  I think so.
[00:22:50.658 --> 00:22:52.739]  Check it out for yourself and help support the transmission.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.082]  Secret 12, Survival Shield X2, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality.
[00:22:57.122 --> 00:22:59.183]  It's all available at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:22:59.223 --> 00:23:00.184]  Third hour coming up.
[00:23:00.444 --> 00:23:01.284]  Your calls and more.
[00:23:01.304 --> 00:23:01.765]  Stay with us.
[00:23:12.694 --> 00:23:19.856]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:23:19.957 --> 00:23:22.137]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:27.519]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:23:27.659 --> 00:23:32.761]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:23:32.901 --> 00:23:36.003]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:23:36.283 --> 00:23:40.206]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:23:40.426 --> 00:23:44.729]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:54.956]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:23:55.176 --> 00:23:57.738]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:23:58.058 --> 00:24:06.090]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
