[00:00:12.648 --> 00:00:16.670]  She recently did a story about a woman who bought a house in Detroit and wanted to sell it.
[00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.891]  But a squatter had taken over the house and refused to leave.
[00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:21.512]  The police were called.
[00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:25.013]  But Lynn the squatter claimed the homeowner tried to run her over.
[00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:29.075]  The homeowner went to jail and Lynn moved her stuff back in the house.
[00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:30.456]  Now you're caught up.
[00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:34.145]  After watching that clip, I began wondering how common squatting was.
[00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:36.367]  Turns out my investigation didn't even have to leave the city of Detroit.
[00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:57.660]  After the reporter helped expose the squatters, she was attacked and had racial obscenities hurled at her.
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.021]  Why do people squat?
[00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:02.364]  How do they manage to get away with it for so long?
[00:01:02.824 --> 00:01:10.712]  The Law.TV reports, for adverse possession to work, squatters have to stay in a home for a minimum time period as mandated by the state.
[00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:13.454]  This time frame varies widely by location.
[00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:17.738]  During that time, many states require the trespasser to have paid property taxes.
[00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:23.521]  Adverse possession was put on the books hundreds of years ago when the law primarily applied to farmland.
[00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:33.146]  Property records were easily lost and damaged then, and adverse possession was a way to keep the land in productive use when it wasn't clear who owned or inherited the land.
[00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:40.150]  So the origins of the practice began innocently enough, but the practice itself has been taken advantage of a great deal since then.
[00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:55.024]  Only an owner can initiate eviction proceedings and the problem here, this house is a foreclosure property that gave the squatters a loophole to hang out and ultimately trash this place and for a time, terrorize the neighborhood.
[00:01:55.584 --> 00:02:02.331]  Deputies went about it quickly and within moments, one tenant left with his bicycle, the other hopped on a skateboard and rolled away.
[00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:08.090]  So if you're a property owner, some of the best investments you can make would be steady fencing and sturdy locks.
