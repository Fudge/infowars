[00:00:00.831 --> 00:00:04.037]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:14.631]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:16.332]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:18.173]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:19.633]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:21.314]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.974 --> 00:00:25.556]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:30.218]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:49.393]  The Maine White House Propaganda Bureau openly run and administered by former White House operatives as officially
[00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:58.834]  Come out and attack yours truly and the Bundy supporters in the ongoing standoff with the tyrannical BLM.
[00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:11.061]  They have come out and officially called us extremist and terrorist, basically, and are busy demonizing the true independent free press in this country.
[00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:16.745]  And again, MSNBC lost 24% of their viewers last year.
[00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:18.887]  They are in a total freefall.
[00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:21.348]  Their top shows have half a million viewers.
[00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:22.569]  That is joke level.
[00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:36.000]  But the reason we report on them is that they are a talking point then, a battle order system, a telegraph system, to the rest of their operatives.
[00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:44.340]  And it goes from the White House directly to MSNBC, White House directly to CNN, White House directly to Media Matters.
[00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:48.469]  And of course, Media Matters literally has almost zero traffic.
[00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:51.810]  They're the size, online, maybe of a small-town newspaper.
[00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:05.658]  But the readers of it are the addled, what's left of the dinosaur media, who go there to scoop up the regurgitated lies, to re-regurgitate them on down the line against us.
[00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:06.919]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.041]  And it ties into what I got into some yesterday, but I'm going to cover in great detail.
[00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.162]  I'm just going to get to it in the first hour, so we covered it.
[00:02:14.327 --> 00:02:20.600]  And that is the documents released by the Clinton Library that we're going to be showing you on screen.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.830]  They're linked in the Breitbart article and they're linked in the WorldNetDaily article.
[00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:44.581]  Where they, three years before Drudge broke the big Clinton stories on the missiles, and the Monica Lewinsky, and the rapes, and the murders, and all the rest of it, Drudge was already operating then, but before he totally dominated, you know, the entire internet,
[00:02:45.382 --> 00:03:01.493]  The Western Journalism Center, run by Joseph Farah, was operating, and the system was accurately predicting how successful it would be, and that it must be defeated, and how to give talking points to the controlled corporate press.
[00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.555]  Now, it's a 300-plus page memo.
[00:03:03.595 --> 00:03:08.018]  The Clintons only released 30-something pages, and it is mind-boggling.
[00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:18.921]  Just to see how open they are about their program to tell the controlled press anyone that questions us is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:19.462 --> 00:03:20.824]  And this is how you shut them down.
[00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:28.002]  So we're going to be discussing that and how they fear grassroots media commentary or even ideas.
[00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:33.123]  You being able to say you don't like BLM having 90% of the land in Nevada.
[00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:39.004]  You saying you don't like Obama giving missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, to Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:46.746]  They want to be able to wall you off, make you feel like you're alone, and they describe how local news stories could get into
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:56.446]  The Western Journalism Center and other real conservative publications and then end up hitting regional papers, then national papers.
[00:03:56.926 --> 00:04:04.652]  And how investigations into criminal activity like Hillary's Cattlegate or Suicide Gate could come out.
[00:04:05.052 --> 00:04:11.397]  Can you imagine what's in the almost 300 pages that's redacted that we're not able to get?
[00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:13.999]  By the way guys, I had it yesterday.
[00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.020]  I just want it pulled out of the stack.
[00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:19.447]  In fact, here it is, you added it.
[00:04:20.088 --> 00:04:25.634]  Clinton administration fears Internet's ability to democratize news three years before drudge bombshell.
[00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:31.621]  And then a newly released Clinton document describes Internet as right-wing tool of conspiracy commerce.
[00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:40.050]  What they're afraid of is us creating our own system to self-fund, to not be dependent on Rockefeller money, federal money, big globalist money.
[00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:50.858]  Because again, they're afraid of us self-funding, voting with dollars, just like you couldn't get organic food 20 years ago, now it's displacing all the garbage food, and the price is dropping because of the market.
[00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:53.239]  More people are coming in to produce it.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.422]  They talk about that in the memo, that, oh my God, we can't give them any freedom.
[00:04:57.722 --> 00:05:01.344]  This is right around the time they lost the fairness doctrine to BandTalk Radio.
[00:05:01.364 --> 00:05:06.207]  So we're going to break that down today and tie it into the huge Bundy bombshells and more.
[00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:19.406]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:21.567]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:05:21.747 --> 00:05:22.448]  Fluoride!
[00:05:22.648 --> 00:05:24.229]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:30.873]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:05:31.133 --> 00:05:35.918]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:05:36.058 --> 00:05:42.124]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.546]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:05:44.806 --> 00:05:47.429]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.112]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:05:51.232 --> 00:05:56.437]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:56.657 --> 00:06:01.461]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:06:09.148 --> 00:06:13.734]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.858]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:06:16.998 --> 00:06:22.224]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:06:22.564 --> 00:06:24.226]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:25.828]  We are what we eat.
[00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.031]  Our food is devoid of nutrition.
[00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:28.652]  I don't know.
[00:06:46.753 --> 00:06:53.677]  The site is literally packed with audio and video featuring top health professionals who don't bow down to Big Pharma.
[00:06:53.817 --> 00:06:59.660]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[00:07:09.064 --> 00:07:16.188]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:16.328 --> 00:07:18.509]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:23.852]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:24.032 --> 00:07:29.155]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:29.275 --> 00:07:32.377]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:32.657 --> 00:07:36.578]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:41.099]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:51.321]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:51.541 --> 00:08:02.443]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:08:02.603 --> 00:08:07.106]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:21.255]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:21.615 --> 00:08:23.857]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:37.062]  Everyone should be asking themselves a very important question right now.
[00:08:38.443 --> 00:08:51.091]  Why do known admitted White House organs of propaganda directed by the White House and by former White House chiefs of staff and others
[00:08:52.048 --> 00:09:04.174]  Why does that rotating door system focus more and more the majority of its time attacking Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, WorldNetDaily?
[00:09:06.355 --> 00:09:07.095]  Why do they do that?
[00:09:08.817 --> 00:09:35.428]  They do that because we know their game plan, we know how the world works, and people have noticed that we know what we're talking about, and that we understand the globalist program, and that these people are not liberals, these people are avowed authoritarians that use socialism as a tool of domestication and control, and who themselves are fascist by any political yardstick.
[00:09:37.475 --> 00:09:43.042]  And the dominant political party of the globalist in this country is the Democrats.
[00:09:43.643 --> 00:09:47.147]  The Republicans are the loyal opposition, working with the elite.
[00:09:48.055 --> 00:10:09.345]  To make conservatives and libertarians and any other opposition feel like they've got somebody up there working for them so that they can never actually block the unpopular stuff that's happening, but only water it down a little bit to create the perception that we can still save the country by working through the current political system.
[00:10:11.826 --> 00:10:12.987]  Now, that said,
[00:10:15.046 --> 00:10:32.714]  When you see media matters openly, publicly run by the White House, they have weekly meetings run by their former White House Transition Chief, you are actually hearing what Obama and Hillary Clinton and The Globalist and John Kerry and Dianne Feinstein really have to say.
[00:10:33.957 --> 00:10:42.100]  And because they're basically front people for the globalists, you're hearing what the Davos group, what the Bilderberg group, what others are actually pitching.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:49.063]  Now there's an article up on Infowars.com that is linked in red that we'll put up on screen for viewers.
[00:10:49.923 --> 00:10:57.106]  MSNBC smears Bundy supporters as insurgents attacks Infowars drudge.
[00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:03.555]  Host Chris Hayes, who looks like another Rachel Maddow, why do they all look the same?
[00:11:03.595 --> 00:11:09.739]  It's just really weird, laments the Alex Jonesification of the GOP.
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.421]  Now, that's not what's really happening.
[00:11:13.822 --> 00:11:18.966]  I would love to be able to get up here and toot my horn, I guess, just for the sake of largesse and ego.
[00:11:19.607 --> 00:11:24.351]  But the truth is, I've just been telling the truth for 19 years on air.
[00:11:25.379 --> 00:11:29.940]  And now so much of it has come true because I was reading globalist battle plans that are public.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.300]  It was public the NSA spied on everything in 1996.
[00:11:33.641 --> 00:11:35.041]  It was in the Telecommunications Act.
[00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:37.461]  It's public they secretly kill American citizens.
[00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:38.721]  It's in the NDAA.
[00:11:39.362 --> 00:11:42.822]  It's public they put fluoride in the water to reduce fertility and lower IQ.
[00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:47.463]  The White House science czar wrote a book about it in 1974, the year I was born.
[00:11:48.383 --> 00:11:49.063]  Ecoscience.
[00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:52.324]  It's not that I'm radical.
[00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:57.262]  It's that I will cover the real radical garbage that's going on.
[00:11:57.282 --> 00:12:00.444]  So let me explain what's happening here, before I get into this and why it's so big.
[00:12:02.966 --> 00:12:10.852]  If you're faced with something so incredibly radical, so incredibly over-the-top, so incredibly evil, like 2 plus 2 equals 5,
[00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.354]  Is being taught in public schools nationwide to first, second, and third graders.
[00:12:16.855 --> 00:12:18.136]  That's been news for two years.
[00:12:18.597 --> 00:12:24.903]  When you're faced with radical Newsweek covers that say the case for killing granny, why death panels are good.
[00:12:26.765 --> 00:12:32.151]  While they simultaneously deny they exist in the bill, which is now law, and call us kooks.
[00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:46.562]  See, when you're faced with that level of full-spectrum lies and deceit, while also throwing it in your face, how do you respond to Peter Singer saying, let parents kill their children up to age two?
[00:12:48.462 --> 00:12:57.284]  How do you respond to the New York Times and the London Guardian calling for the arrest
[00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:01.593]  Of anyone that disagrees with anthropogenic global warming, or man-made global warming.
[00:13:01.913 --> 00:13:04.294]  How do you respond to 53 million aborted babies?
[00:13:04.954 --> 00:13:07.395]  How do you respond to 52% of blacks being aborted?
[00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:15.819]  How do you respond to illegals being able to come here and get everything free, including their babies born, but then citizens can't get that?
[00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:23.742]  How do you respond to tens of trillions of dollars stolen by offshore banks, where we sign on to the foreign debt?
[00:13:24.983 --> 00:13:27.604]  And then we're debt poppers and told how we were lazy.
[00:13:28.735 --> 00:13:33.417]  And the very people we give the money, then use the money to buy off all our politicians.
[00:13:33.657 --> 00:13:52.903]  How do you respond to Warren Buffett, being the biggest recipient of banker bailout money, and the biggest public lobbyist, spending over $300 million, look it up, in the last six years, promoting tax increases in TV ads, print ads, and underwriting ABC Nightly News, CNN, look it up!
[00:13:53.922 --> 00:14:01.128]  Did you know Warren Buffett and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation underwrite almost every major TV show and channel out there?
[00:14:02.869 --> 00:14:03.230]  Look it up.
[00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:11.376]  Hundreds of millions of dollars of your money used to prop up MSNBC, ABC Nightly News.
[00:14:11.656 --> 00:14:14.198]  They are paid to come out and attack their enemies.
[00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:15.620]  And who do they attack?
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.101]  They attack yours truly.
[00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.171]  Because they know, ladies and gentlemen, I've read the books they've written.
[00:14:22.651 --> 00:14:25.152]  They think you're so stupid that you'll never go read them.
[00:14:25.452 --> 00:14:26.472]  I've read their writings.
[00:14:26.652 --> 00:14:27.692]  I know who they are.
[00:14:28.172 --> 00:14:29.533]  I know who their minions are.
[00:14:30.033 --> 00:14:31.533]  I know what their game plan is.
[00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:40.655]  The truth is, up until about a year or two ago, they would tell the truth in policy papers what they were up to.
[00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:47.777]  Gary Hart would write in Huffington Post, we staged terror attacks and we may stage another one to launch a war against Iran.
[00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.610]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:14:50.871 --> 00:15:04.058]  They operate out in the open and have literally hundreds of books written by top futurists saying they're going to build a world government and exterminate the majority of the population, but first dumb us down and have us ask for our extermination.
[00:15:04.938 --> 00:15:26.249]  I mean, I've read stuff from the 20s and 30s about how they had to get children out of people's arms into baskets and into crates and into cradles and cribs to break the human connection to them because they found when they removed baby rats from their mothers, they were addled, stupid, fearful, and pathetic.
[00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.151]  I mean, the children don't get mother's milk.
[00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:32.813]  Their brains are a third smaller on average when given formula.
[00:15:33.593 --> 00:15:37.116]  There's a reason the public's dumb and cowardly and weak.
[00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:42.061]  I was hanging on my parents' neck like a monkey.
[00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:43.502]  I slept with them.
[00:15:43.802 --> 00:15:45.504]  I sat there and watched everything they did.
[00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:58.035]  I have memories when I was like a year and a half old of realizing I had a symbiotic relationship with my parents and fearing something would happen to them because they were my biological robot that did things for me.
[00:15:58.956 --> 00:16:06.179]  Kids supposed to be hanging like a monkey off their parents' neck, watching everything, developing into a seriously smart, aggressive creature.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.501]  Instead, you look at all these people, they're little kids.
[00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:17.464]  The SWAT teams, all of them, are trying to be men, trying to find their mother, trying to find their father, trying to find their tribe.
[00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:23.068]  That they have biologically, and now all the science is coming out in major universities.
[00:16:23.128 --> 00:16:28.292]  I saw one out of Princeton just the other day, another out of Calgary up in Canada.
[00:16:28.712 --> 00:16:31.794]  And the top professors are going, epigenetics, it's incredible.
[00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:34.236]  We need to be held and we need to be taught.
[00:16:34.256 --> 00:16:39.000]  We need to go through things when we're a kid so that it triggers our epigenetics and boosts the IQ.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:46.506]  And they're going, I can't believe that everything we do is to lower IQ and to lower human development and accessing our real programming.
[00:16:47.927 --> 00:16:50.608]  What, you just think you just discovered that this year, scientist?
[00:16:52.449 --> 00:16:54.870]  The new adulthood is at 25, it's about to be 30.
[00:16:55.170 --> 00:17:07.555]  These people, if a baby isn't held by their parents, if a baby isn't given the fat in the mother's milk, the baby releases hormones and chemicals and then activates genes.
[00:17:07.775 --> 00:17:08.515]  This is on record.
[00:17:11.294 --> 00:17:19.921]  To where they live in fear and are totally cowardly and have no idea what planet they're on and then have to be given antidepressants because they're so freaked out.
[00:17:20.242 --> 00:17:25.086]  Oh, when your 11-year-old daughter has anxiety because she's got zits for the first time and goes into puberty?
[00:17:25.686 --> 00:17:29.570]  It isn't go through the crisis, deal with it, learn how to deal with it.
[00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:34.154]  No, it's drug your daughter with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and stuff like that.
[00:17:35.407 --> 00:17:36.027]  Psychotropics.
[00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:42.892]  When your son gets beat up for the first time, or beats somebody up as they start a fight, the answer is drug them instead of giving them a medal.
[00:17:43.872 --> 00:17:47.254]  You're not allowed to go through any of the rites of passage.
[00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:50.236]  And I biologically realized this myself a long time ago.
[00:17:51.517 --> 00:17:56.540]  Because it's the rites of passage that then activate another chapter in who you are.
[00:18:00.542 --> 00:18:04.785]  And I don't believe in reincarnation, but it is a hundred percent fact
[00:18:05.714 --> 00:18:14.296]  That you are the generations that came before you, but you must have ritual, that's what ritual is, to activate the genes.
[00:18:14.356 --> 00:18:15.277]  And it's now been proven.
[00:18:15.497 --> 00:18:17.597]  And I'm going to get a string of scientists on.
[00:18:18.057 --> 00:18:22.818]  Top psychologists, top psychiatrists, top geneticists, top neurologists.
[00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:25.319]  I mean, there is a growing body of evidence.
[00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:27.800]  And of course, the elite knows this.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.001]  And everything they do is to block your ascension.
[00:18:33.942 --> 00:18:38.348]  Is to block your honorable development into manhood, into womanhood.
[00:18:38.588 --> 00:18:41.732]  You're supposed to be a man by the time you're 12 or 13, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:43.314 --> 00:18:47.399]  At least a man physically, a man in your desires, a man in your will.
[00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:52.806]  Not when you're 27, the new average age for lunch for an American male.
[00:18:56.294 --> 00:19:02.860]  And then the globalists bring the fake thug life, thug gangster system as that's supposed to be male to young men.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.781]  And I've already digressed.
[00:19:03.821 --> 00:19:18.975]  My point is, when you see MSNBC or CNN, this is hardcore, weaponized, anti-human, destructive systems to turn off your life force, to turn off your genetics, and to make you be an adult, weak, nanny state creature.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.183]  So that you can be absorbed into the singularity and so you won't struggle.
[00:19:24.423 --> 00:19:29.008]  They don't want alive conscious humans to try to struggle for control of their own destiny.
[00:19:29.248 --> 00:19:33.251]  They want to program your destiny and force you into a false collective.
[00:19:33.852 --> 00:19:36.494]  You're already part of a collective, all of your ancestors.
[00:19:37.015 --> 00:19:43.821]  And you live in the collective structures and literature and art and music and religion that they built.
[00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:48.090]  Do you understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.811]  And these people want to rob you of that.
[00:19:50.831 --> 00:19:53.892]  So when we come back, we're going to break down how to defeat them.
[00:19:54.492 --> 00:20:00.174]  We're going to break down they're desperately hitting the panic button, saying, GOP, do not listen to Alex Jones.
[00:20:00.194 --> 00:20:02.815]  They're trying to set the parameter, saying, do not listen to this man.
[00:20:03.075 --> 00:20:05.676]  Because if you listen to me, we will overthrow these people.
[00:20:06.516 --> 00:20:07.297]  We will be right back.
[00:20:07.317 --> 00:20:07.677]  Stay with us.
[00:20:09.401 --> 00:20:11.982]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[00:20:38.918 --> 00:20:48.189]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:48.229 --> 00:20:55.077]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:55.177 --> 00:20:58.819]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:22:07.918 --> 00:22:14.005]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:22:14.045 --> 00:22:17.369]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:19.051]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:25.338]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spears.
[00:22:25.418 --> 00:22:31.342]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:22:31.462 --> 00:22:35.224]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:22:35.404 --> 00:22:38.286]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:22:38.306 --> 00:22:46.492]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:48.773]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:22:48.833 --> 00:22:49.874]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:22:50.234 --> 00:22:58.943]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:23:19.034 --> 00:23:25.119]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.

[00:24:02.643 --> 00:24:04.504]  MyPatriotSupply.com.
[00:24:27.093 --> 00:24:28.494]  It's coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:28.534 --> 00:24:29.215]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:24:29.295 --> 00:24:36.800]  Alex Jones here live on this Tuesday, 22nd day of April, 2014 edition.
[00:24:38.482 --> 00:24:42.785]  But before I go any further, the story is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:43.245 --> 00:24:47.108]  MSNBC smears Bundy supporters as insurgents.
[00:24:47.228 --> 00:24:49.770]  And what happens to American citizens that are insurgents?
[00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:50.670]  NDAA.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.241]  You can be disappeared, according to Obama, if you really think he's a dictator.
[00:24:56.941 --> 00:25:09.484]  And Steve Watson wrote an article last night where the anti-Bundy people, the Democrats, are calling all over the place for the military to be used and to kill any land rights activists.
[00:25:09.524 --> 00:25:17.466]  Well, I've told you for 17 years of 19 years on air, because I didn't start going to urban warfare drills, so I've been on air about 2-3 years,
[00:25:18.837 --> 00:25:24.199]  That every time I went, they weren't trying to fight radical Muslims or the Russian military or the Chinese military.
[00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:30.522]  They were training to fight people wearing John Deere caps and screaming, I'm an American, please don't put me in the camp.
[00:25:30.942 --> 00:25:32.162]  I have a right to a second amendment.
[00:25:32.302 --> 00:25:41.686]  And I also have video of the urban warfare drills that we had to clandestinely shoot because the Marines threw me out both times.
[00:25:42.286 --> 00:25:43.627]  I got press passes and got in.
[00:25:43.687 --> 00:25:44.127]  They would have
[00:25:45.265 --> 00:25:50.147]  One case, Colonel Love ordered their PR guy, his name was Jones, to just freak out.
[00:25:50.167 --> 00:25:51.447]  I mean, he was violently angry.
[00:25:52.087 --> 00:25:54.828]  And some of that's on video, and they caught me getting the video.
[00:25:55.828 --> 00:25:58.949]  Of the executions of gun owners?
[00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.310]  It's all on video in Police State 2000.
[00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.732]  And people saw this, this was under Clinton, in 99.
[00:26:05.772 --> 00:26:10.113]  They were so freaked out by it that they thought the video must be fake.
[00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:17.351]  Hovercraft landing in San Francisco and Oakland, 3,000 troops, foreign troops as well.
[00:26:17.652 --> 00:26:18.452]  No, it's all real.
[00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:21.613]  The warrior fighting vehicles, all of it.
[00:26:21.893 --> 00:26:22.473]  It's all real!
[00:26:23.533 --> 00:26:24.893]  You wanna know what radicalized me?
[00:26:25.073 --> 00:26:25.534]  Reality.
[00:26:27.014 --> 00:26:33.135]  Reality and the research of reality and the facing of reality radicalized Alex Jones.
[00:26:33.556 --> 00:26:34.256]  We should tweet that.
[00:26:35.416 --> 00:26:39.077]  Reality is what radicalized me, Alex Jones.
[00:26:41.696 --> 00:26:57.119]  Reality and facing it is what radicalized me because when you're faced with hard core anti-human social engineers who get off on using social engineering to disempower us, the globalists hated Americans.
[00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:06.796]  So we've gone from the highest test scores, the highest IQs, the most patents, the most trailblazing, the toughest fighters.
[00:27:07.196 --> 00:27:07.717]  It was true.
[00:27:07.817 --> 00:27:17.282]  People all over the world, historians from France and Russia and Japan came here and lived here and wrote countless books saying these people are incredible.
[00:27:19.053 --> 00:27:20.453]  We're not too incredible now, are we?
[00:27:20.633 --> 00:27:21.414]  The most obese.
[00:27:21.614 --> 00:27:22.434]  The most cancer.
[00:27:22.914 --> 00:27:23.974]  The most autistic.
[00:27:24.134 --> 00:27:25.134]  The most diseases.
[00:27:25.455 --> 00:27:26.515]  The most diabetes.
[00:27:26.695 --> 00:27:27.555]  The most cancer.
[00:27:27.795 --> 00:27:28.815]  The most breast cancer.
[00:27:28.955 --> 00:27:29.896]  The most bone cancer.
[00:27:30.036 --> 00:27:30.476]  And why?
[00:27:31.136 --> 00:27:35.037]  Because we've been under chemical warfare by these eugenics bastards!
[00:27:36.737 --> 00:27:38.338]  And you know who makes little jokes about it?
[00:27:38.598 --> 00:27:41.518]  The White House pimps over at MSNBC.
[00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:47.680]  Do you people really think you're going to be part of the chosen elite when this New World Order singularity comes in?
[00:27:48.757 --> 00:27:50.418]  I don't know if the singularity is going to be real.
[00:27:50.658 --> 00:27:51.799]  I don't know if it's feasible.
[00:27:52.199 --> 00:27:54.941]  All I know is the elite believe it like a stinking religion.
[00:27:55.381 --> 00:27:57.843]  And let me tell you, I've seen what comes out of the other end of your religion.
[00:27:58.823 --> 00:28:01.405]  And it stinks, and it's poison, and it's bad.
[00:28:02.146 --> 00:28:03.747]  So you want to make me a Republican?
[00:28:04.048 --> 00:28:07.491]  You want to freak out and say, oh my gosh, the Jonesification of the GOP?
[00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:08.672]  That's not what's happening.
[00:28:09.172 --> 00:28:13.796]  You've had the Jonesification of America and the world, because it's not a Jonesification.
[00:28:14.296 --> 00:28:20.762]  It's a survival instinct that's in everyone, and I speak to it as an emergency beacon, nothing more.
[00:28:21.022 --> 00:28:22.023]  And here's the good news.
[00:28:22.383 --> 00:28:26.006]  I've already sent my transmission hundreds of thousands of times.
[00:28:27.102 --> 00:28:32.051]  And the transmission will only get stronger as you press down on the people.
[00:28:33.954 --> 00:28:37.901]  When you attack Rand Paul for being associated with me, his ratings go up.
[00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:42.940]  When you attack Drudge for being associated with me, his ratings go up.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:51.185]  When you attack the senator from Nevada, the one that's speaking out against Harry Reid, we're going to talk about, his ratings go up.
[00:28:51.526 --> 00:28:58.090]  People have a hunger for justice, a hunger for liberty, a hunger to thrive, a hunger to innovate, a hunger for the future.
[00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:03.154]  You people claim you're the egalitarians, trying to build up humanity, but in all your internal writings,
[00:29:03.894 --> 00:29:07.355]  That you think we're too stupid to read, and that you think we're too dumb to track.
[00:29:07.695 --> 00:29:11.836]  You talk about your hate and disdain for not just us, but yourselves.
[00:29:12.196 --> 00:29:14.716]  Because you got left in the crib.
[00:29:15.056 --> 00:29:16.917]  You sat in crap-filled diapers.
[00:29:17.197 --> 00:29:23.298]  Your parents were mean, inbred, psychopaths, and sociopaths, and sadists, and abused you.
[00:29:24.078 --> 00:29:26.959]  And because they did that to you, you want to do that to us.
[00:29:26.979 --> 00:29:27.599]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:28.839]  My parents loved me.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.540]  And their parents loved them.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:43.203]  And just because we've been naive, we're a lot stronger than you, we're a lot more powerful than you, we're more vicious than you, and you're going to find out about the real humanity.
[00:29:44.463 --> 00:29:46.704]  And you know in your gut you're gonna fail!
[00:29:47.604 --> 00:29:49.205]  You know in your gut you're going down.
[00:29:49.445 --> 00:29:50.605]  And I've already achieved victory.
[00:29:51.885 --> 00:29:57.207]  And anyone that steps into being a real human, and a real man, and honor, and a real woman, has already had the victory.
[00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.531]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.451 --> 00:30:05.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.154 --> 00:30:14.835]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda, they are manipulating our genetics.
[00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:23.298]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:30:23.618 --> 00:30:25.679]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[00:30:25.839 --> 00:30:39.729]  Pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:39.929 --> 00:30:47.554]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:47.954 --> 00:30:54.038]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:30:54.298 --> 00:31:02.923]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Supermail Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[00:31:03.043 --> 00:31:07.025]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality.
[00:31:07.205 --> 00:31:08.065]  InfoWarsLife.com
[00:31:09.497 --> 00:31:18.483]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:31:18.583 --> 00:31:26.808]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:26.988 --> 00:31:31.671]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:31:31.871 --> 00:31:38.275]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:38.635 --> 00:31:45.719]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:31:45.819 --> 00:31:52.682]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:31:52.842 --> 00:31:57.184]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:31:57.324 --> 00:32:00.526]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:32:00.706 --> 00:32:06.828]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:09.229]  Available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:17.491]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:32:17.731 --> 00:32:19.692]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:32:19.972 --> 00:32:22.594]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:32:22.675 --> 00:32:26.778]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:32:27.099 --> 00:32:30.261]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:37.548]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:32:37.728 --> 00:32:41.872]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:32:42.052 --> 00:32:43.734]  We are the true media.
[00:32:43.854 --> 00:32:46.436]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:32:46.516 --> 00:32:50.160]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[00:33:20.855 --> 00:33:27.115]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:48.913]  But the Alex Jonesification of the GOP is much bigger than the Bundy Ranch.
[00:33:49.433 --> 00:33:53.716]  Take Greg Brannan, Tea Party Republican candidate for Senate in North Carolina.
[00:33:54.116 --> 00:33:59.080]  He's running neck and neck with establishment favorite Tom Tillis for the Republican Senate nomination.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.162]  Notice they're playing Halloween slasher music the whole time.
[00:34:04.123 --> 00:34:08.286]  Like, oh my gosh, it's so frightening because they're all about setting the parameters.
[00:34:08.666 --> 00:34:14.050]  And I'm going to go over this whole report right now and then tie it in to the documents that have recently come out.
[00:34:15.431 --> 00:34:26.140]  Where Bill Clinton, as early as 1993, when he first got in office, they were putting out 300 plus page reports on how to shut down any free speech in America.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.684]  And they actually say, we don't want voices out there we don't control.
[00:34:32.825 --> 00:34:37.229]  And this is published on Bill Clinton's own presidential library website.
[00:34:41.186 --> 00:34:42.167]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:34:42.787 --> 00:34:45.230]  It shows exactly who these people are.
[00:34:49.894 --> 00:35:00.323]  Now, who are these very people today, the current Clintons that run Obama as their front man and who control media matters that writes the talking points for CNN and MSNBC on record?
[00:35:00.643 --> 00:35:02.445]  Who is the White House addressing and attacking?
[00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.332]  They're attacking Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, and WorldNetDaily.
[00:35:06.833 --> 00:35:11.096]  Infowars.com, DrudgeReport.com, WND.com.
[00:35:11.336 --> 00:35:13.838]  By the way, Joseph Ferre is in studio next Monday.
[00:35:15.319 --> 00:35:17.040]  He's going to be in studio next Monday.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.101]  We're going to be breaking all this down and more.
[00:35:19.121 --> 00:35:20.262]  Look forward to that.
[00:35:22.944 --> 00:35:28.008]  Oh good, so he's here in Texas shooting a film over the weekend, so he's going to be here Friday and Monday.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:29.960]  Okay, good.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.362]  Over the phone Friday, in studio Monday.
[00:35:32.442 --> 00:35:33.243]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:35:33.743 --> 00:35:39.708]  Now, long story short here, ladies and gentlemen, this is epic history happening right now.
[00:35:39.868 --> 00:35:46.514]  And when I get up in the morning and see that Paul Watson's written this article, and I watch this news piece, I did not get happy for me personally.
[00:35:48.495 --> 00:35:53.119]  My flesh, or my worldly side, went, man, you better watch it.
[00:35:54.062 --> 00:36:05.878]  Because when you've got ruthless mafia criminals like the Attorney General, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Obama, their front man, literally with you in their gun sights, it's not fun.
[00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:07.880]  So pray for us.
[00:36:08.806 --> 00:36:11.006]  There's no telling what they're going to pull.
[00:36:11.447 --> 00:36:12.227]  And they've pulled plenty.
[00:36:12.267 --> 00:36:15.387]  They've put FBI disinformation operatives on us.
[00:36:15.447 --> 00:36:17.868]  They've sent the white supremacists after us.
[00:36:17.988 --> 00:36:23.529]  Every time cops get killed, they plant evidence that the person's a follower of mine, and we have to go prove it isn't.
[00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:26.810]  I mean, they really want to bring me down.
[00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:37.152]  And they want to bring down Matt Drudge, obviously, target number one, and they want to bring down people like WorldNetDaily.
[00:36:37.172 --> 00:36:38.212]  And I'm going to say this again.
[00:36:39.562 --> 00:36:42.224]  I've never really attacked Glenn Beck, except when he attacks me.
[00:36:42.865 --> 00:36:44.907]  Or Rush Limbaugh, or Sean Hannity, or any of them.
[00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:45.847]  Because here's the deal.
[00:36:45.927 --> 00:36:49.030]  When the globalists take over, they will go after those people.
[00:36:49.791 --> 00:37:02.621]  Even if they've been part of a corrupt GOP establishment, they're going to extinct that just because the GOP stood for pro-life, and stood for low taxes, and stood for land rights and family rights.
[00:37:02.982 --> 00:37:04.483]  It will be eradicated.
[00:37:05.764 --> 00:37:06.805]  That's their goal number one.
[00:37:08.976 --> 00:37:12.997]  And then they'll split the Democratic Party in two different parties and continue the balkanization that way.
[00:37:13.457 --> 00:37:17.278]  They'll have a racial side of the Democratic Party and then kind of an economic side.
[00:37:18.639 --> 00:37:20.459]  And they've already said that's their plan.
[00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:23.480]  They do the same social engineering in Europe.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:33.923]  And they do it by saying they're not radical while pushing the most radical anti-human ideas and then demonizing mainline human values.
[00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:37.120]  And it's called the Overton Window.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.161]  Will you guys put up on screen a definition of the Overton Window?
[00:37:40.521 --> 00:37:40.841]  Thank you.
[00:37:42.142 --> 00:37:45.663]  And the Overton Window is basically a sociology idea that I agree with.
[00:37:46.043 --> 00:37:48.204]  It's a way of looking at it as an allegory.
[00:37:48.604 --> 00:37:52.866]  Imagine a political window that you're looking out of that you accept.
[00:37:54.363 --> 00:37:55.183]  Let me just read the definition.
[00:37:55.463 --> 00:38:00.764]  The Overton window is a political theory that describes a narrow window, the range of ideas the public will accept.
[00:38:01.244 --> 00:38:11.406]  On this theory, an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it fails or falls within the narrow window, rather than on politicians' individual preferences.
[00:38:11.926 --> 00:38:20.308]  It is named for its originator, Joseph P. Overton, 1960, a former vice president of the Center for Public Policy,
[00:38:20.828 --> 00:38:34.798]  At any given moment, the window includes a range of policies considered politically acceptable in the current climate of public opinion, which a politician can recommend without being considered too extreme to gain and keep the public's office.
[00:38:34.878 --> 00:38:43.144]  Now, what the White House does is, they have all their operatives and czars and minions come out and say, we should kill babies up to age two.
[00:38:43.204 --> 00:38:44.145]  We should kill old people.
[00:38:45.151 --> 00:38:47.392]  Yes, we're going to bankrupt healthcare and bring in death panels.
[00:38:47.772 --> 00:38:50.832]  Yes, we think men are inherently bad and all sex is rape.
[00:38:51.473 --> 00:38:52.673]  Yes, world government's good.
[00:38:52.973 --> 00:38:55.293]  Yes, we want to reduce the population down to 100 million.
[00:38:56.114 --> 00:38:59.214]  Yes, we're bringing in planetary government and putting fluoride in the water to brain damage you.
[00:38:59.855 --> 00:39:01.755]  Yes, we're going to teach 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:39:02.355 --> 00:39:03.956]  Yes, we want forced inoculations.
[00:39:04.516 --> 00:39:05.656]  Those are the surrogates.
[00:39:06.396 --> 00:39:09.377]  They're there to move the Overton window over into eugenics,
[00:39:10.257 --> 00:39:13.138]  Ultra-Hitlerian land, and then call it liberal.
[00:39:13.638 --> 00:39:17.900]  Call the cyanide-laced, Kool-Aid, uh, mother's milk, okay?
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:24.743]  I mean, they're meant to go on TV, on MSNBC, in a promo that runs every hour, and say, your kids belong to us.
[00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:29.445]  When you destroy the idea that your kids belong to parents, they belong to the state.
[00:39:30.145 --> 00:39:34.067]  And they say openly, we're going to destroy the idea of the family.
[00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.008]  And then call that liberal.
[00:39:37.915 --> 00:39:40.258]  Total authoritarian, sci-fi level evil.
[00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:42.099]  They're not on the left.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.861]  These people are in the pit of hell.
[00:39:44.943 --> 00:39:56.515]  I see things mainly as a circle with a black hole of tyranny at the middle that is a political gravity that sucks in all the other individually truly diverse ideas that form a renaissance society.
[00:39:58.792 --> 00:40:00.313]  A truly illuminated society.
[00:40:00.733 --> 00:40:06.715]  The Illuminati seeks to create darkness for everyone else, but they're illuminated with the knowledge, and you're basically blind.
[00:40:07.175 --> 00:40:08.736]  See, they're a counterfeit Illuminati.
[00:40:09.596 --> 00:40:10.797]  They're a counterfeit Christ.
[00:40:11.537 --> 00:40:12.557]  God eliminates.
[00:40:13.718 --> 00:40:19.980]  The devil creates a black sunshine that only his people can see in, but even they are blind to a certain level.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.961]  They're only allowed to operate in an evil spectrum.
[00:40:21.981 --> 00:40:23.982]  I mean, you're getting the deep knowledge here.
[00:40:24.022 --> 00:40:25.002]  I hope you're listening right now.
[00:40:26.974 --> 00:40:28.856]  This is the philosophy that they understand.
[00:40:29.096 --> 00:40:34.020]  They've chosen evil because it will give them temporal power on this planet.
[00:40:35.221 --> 00:40:37.242]  While they lose their soul.
[00:40:37.683 --> 00:40:41.466]  And by soul, if you don't believe in the soul, they lose their true free human intellect.
[00:40:42.767 --> 00:40:46.369]  They lose the incredible heights of free expression.
[00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:50.112]  But again, they label it as something good when it's something bad.
[00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:57.243]  Everything in these MSNBC and CNN pieces is accepted mainline politics.
[00:40:57.263 --> 00:40:58.084]  They say it over and over again.
[00:40:58.464 --> 00:40:59.824]  Normal politics!
[00:41:01.445 --> 00:41:04.046]  You know, should your child be taught death education at 5 or at 11?
[00:41:06.854 --> 00:41:09.495]  Well, all death education has been proven to increase suicide.
[00:41:09.756 --> 00:41:11.677]  Look at the numbers, all-time highs in youth.
[00:41:12.017 --> 00:41:13.017]  The drugging's caused that.
[00:41:13.258 --> 00:41:14.418]  Gee, is there a correlation?
[00:41:14.658 --> 00:41:15.379]  Of course there is.
[00:41:15.399 --> 00:41:24.083]  It's separating kids from their parents, giving them formula meant to shrink the size of their brain development and makes them adult little cowardly creatures.
[00:41:25.244 --> 00:41:26.085]  Is that a good idea?
[00:41:26.525 --> 00:41:28.226]  Everything they do is to hurt you.
[00:41:29.847 --> 00:41:33.809]  Everything they do is to rob freedom from you and the Promethean fire.
[00:41:35.265 --> 00:41:36.405]  These people are an abomination.
[00:41:37.246 --> 00:41:38.186]  They are a desolation.
[00:41:39.707 --> 00:41:41.707]  There is no way to describe how evil they are.
[00:41:42.027 --> 00:41:51.791]  So everything they do is to keep the Overton window as far towards evil, as far down the black hole as they can, while demonizing any free thinker outside of that paradigm.
[00:41:53.231 --> 00:41:57.352]  And trying to flog you and beat you over the head if you associate with anyone else.
[00:41:57.413 --> 00:42:01.294]  I mean, when we have people from the left on here, they really get upset.
[00:42:02.196 --> 00:42:22.396]  When we have Muslims on, or we have feminists on, or we reach across to people, when we get past the labels, they go into absolute chicken-with-a-head-cut-off mode because they need to keep you on a very narrow reservation that's continually radicalized, racing away from common sense.
[00:42:24.127 --> 00:42:26.308]  And so they're afraid because they know what I'm doing.
[00:42:26.629 --> 00:42:27.809]  I'm not apologizing.
[00:42:27.869 --> 00:42:29.551]  I'm not playing the game of being reasonable.
[00:42:30.191 --> 00:42:36.855]  I go on these shows and I say you are the enemy working for offshore banks to de-industrialize this country, disarm us and enslave us.
[00:42:37.156 --> 00:42:37.776]  You're the enemy.
[00:42:37.816 --> 00:42:38.496]  You're on notice.
[00:42:38.617 --> 00:42:39.077]  I see you.
[00:42:40.583 --> 00:42:41.184]  End of discussion.
[00:42:41.444 --> 00:42:53.654]  And because it's true, almost everyone recognizes the truth, because you already subconsciously have a very powerful mind, and your subconscious recognizes it, and in your gut, that's your subconscious, says, this man speaks the truth.
[00:42:54.735 --> 00:42:58.058]  So see, they can't allow a debate with someone that just cuts through it all.
[00:42:58.999 --> 00:43:01.341]  It doesn't play along with the larger game.
[00:43:03.396 --> 00:43:04.697]  So that's what they're up to here.
[00:43:05.518 --> 00:43:14.766]  And so everything they do is to teach you that you don't have any power and that you can only have power by being part of a collective that is their projection, their idea.
[00:43:17.749 --> 00:43:19.911]  And so they come out in a 15-minute report.
[00:43:20.151 --> 00:43:21.872]  The whole thing's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:24.034 --> 00:43:25.516]  And they demonize
[00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:27.887]  Anyone?
[00:43:43.065 --> 00:43:45.426]  200 vehicles, 400 agents we now learn.
[00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:48.668]  They're shooting the cattle illegally, breaking the water pipes.
[00:43:48.968 --> 00:43:52.610]  Federal judge says it's part of a criminal conspiracy to run everyone out of business.
[00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.431]  52 families are gone, one family's left.
[00:43:55.771 --> 00:43:58.613]  The image of them like Tiananmen Square, beating people up.
[00:43:58.953 --> 00:43:59.873]  Citizens respond.
[00:44:00.113 --> 00:44:05.256]  They come, most of them without guns, but some with guns, and say, if you're going to shoot us, go ahead and do it.
[00:44:05.596 --> 00:44:07.417]  We're going to then fight back against you.
[00:44:08.775 --> 00:44:25.439]  And the image of cowboys and men, women, and children walking across the line with a loudspeaker saying, we will shoot you, was like East Germans walking towards machine guns in the fall of Eastern Germany, of the Soviet nightmare, East Germany, and crossing over the Berlin Wall.
[00:44:26.419 --> 00:44:32.561]  It's that level of people engaged in real civil disobedience against dehumanization and wickedness.
[00:44:34.608 --> 00:44:35.569]  And they can't have that.
[00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:40.812]  So they've got to have Harry Reid, you know, they're upset that the other senator is saying this is patriotism.
[00:44:42.053 --> 00:44:56.062]  Because if that spreads, if that happens, and if the public ever realizes, wow, Drudge has like 10 million people visit his site a day, Alex Jones has over a million and a half to his sites and a million to his Facebook and Twitter and
[00:44:57.318 --> 00:45:01.760]  Three million terrestrial listeners every day, 15 million a week, and MSNBC has 500,000?
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.762]  Why are they setting the parameters?
[00:45:04.862 --> 00:45:06.143]  Why are they controlling the debate?
[00:45:06.523 --> 00:45:08.124]  Alex Jones doesn't tell me what to think.
[00:45:08.344 --> 00:45:11.665]  He says what he thinks, shows his evidence, just tells it like it is.
[00:45:12.326 --> 00:45:13.346]  I don't put on an act here.
[00:45:13.386 --> 00:45:16.068]  I don't talk real slow and talk to you like you're a five-year-old.
[00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.552]  The fact is, MSNBC is plunging in the ratings.
[00:45:24.892 --> 00:45:26.313]  We are exploding in the ratings.
[00:45:28.885 --> 00:45:33.212]  The truth is, they're dying, and they tried to suppress a free press in this country.
[00:45:33.233 --> 00:45:39.143]  They tried to stop talk radio being legalized, where you could just go on the air and say what you think, and take calls, because they don't want you having a platform.
[00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:46.191]  Only thing going up is MSNBC's web ratings, but they're still a lot lower than ours.
[00:45:46.532 --> 00:45:50.573]  Their actual physical ratings in TV are down 24% in one year.
[00:45:50.873 --> 00:45:56.896]  You type in the headline, MSNBC ratings dropped 24% in 2013.
[00:45:57.376 --> 00:45:58.336]  We'll put that on screen for you.
[00:45:58.597 --> 00:46:01.298]  Along with all the other globalist operations.
[00:46:01.938 --> 00:46:02.998]  We're gonna skip this network break.
[00:46:03.018 --> 00:46:04.279]  I gotta quit doing it, but I can't help it.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.801]  I wanna get to this video and this audio now, that we're analyzing here.
[00:46:10.662 --> 00:46:11.042]  Because
[00:46:12.745 --> 00:46:17.206]  They now understand that they're at freefall.
[00:46:18.527 --> 00:46:35.652]  They now understand that the idea of freedom is getting out there, so they want to brand the idea of libertarianism, constitutionalism, new renaissance, space exploration, humanity unifying globally around free will, not around autocratic forced systems.
[00:46:37.608 --> 00:46:39.653]  They're scared to death of real liberalism.
[00:46:40.375 --> 00:46:46.150]  And so they want to say, I'm GOP, so that all the Democrats get the word, oh, I don't want to go to a Tea Party.
[00:46:49.011 --> 00:46:50.011]  I don't want to be around those racists.
[00:46:50.051 --> 00:46:54.312]  I don't want to be around that Alex Jones who MSNBC says is deeply racist and then shows no proof.
[00:46:54.753 --> 00:46:56.793]  Or behind the Boston bombing and shows no proof.
[00:46:57.033 --> 00:46:58.093]  Why are they so scared of us?
[00:46:58.153 --> 00:47:04.755]  Because they know that we're not putting out talking points, we're putting out hardcore historical analysis with passion.
[00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:18.659]  People are listening, they're looking it up, they're finding out I'm accurate and then more, they're finding out their own information and they can see with their NSA systems how fast liberty is rising and they're hitting the panic button.
[00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:42.211]  Now also in this piece, and then we're going to play it, also in this piece, if you listen to it, you notice they go 9-11 truther Alex Jones, knowing that the Republicans and Democrats attacked 9-11 truthers under Bush, so they also want to make Republicans go, ooh, I better not support anything Alex Jones does, he's a 9-11 truther.
[00:47:42.471 --> 00:47:46.591]  Folks, the government's been caught running Al Qaeda all over the world, giving them stinger missiles now.
[00:47:47.692 --> 00:47:48.652]  That was in the news yesterday.
[00:47:49.861 --> 00:47:51.263]  There are real radical Muslims.
[00:47:51.303 --> 00:47:55.850]  My point is, they're being allowed to operate so that when they attack us, our liberties can be taken.
[00:47:56.831 --> 00:48:01.218]  And they just want to boil that down and say, oh, you know, he says the firefighters blew up the towers.
[00:48:01.618 --> 00:48:04.042]  That's something they've said on Fox and CNN.
[00:48:04.302 --> 00:48:04.883]  I never said that.
[00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:07.603]  They want you to be divided.
[00:48:07.823 --> 00:48:09.644]  They want conservatives divided away from me.
[00:48:09.885 --> 00:48:11.385]  They want liberals divided away from me.
[00:48:11.666 --> 00:48:31.758]  They want everybody because they don't want people understanding the unifying message of being aware of the social engineering globalists that are sitting on top of us using psychology, psychiatry, advertising, propaganda, spin, psyops, product placement, propaganda placement, behavior placement.
[00:48:31.918 --> 00:48:35.220]  You know, I coined the term propaganda placement and they now use it.
[00:48:36.152 --> 00:48:37.253]  They call it behavior placement.
[00:48:38.594 --> 00:48:39.334]  You don't have to.
[00:48:39.494 --> 00:48:41.636]  I'm here telling you the magic trick is fixed.
[00:48:42.016 --> 00:48:44.017]  And I'm telling you how he does the magic trick.
[00:48:44.377 --> 00:48:46.919]  And you're like a little kid, new listeners, going, oh no, it's real.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:48.420]  No, it's not.
[00:48:49.841 --> 00:48:58.246]  There's a compartment in that table where he reaches in and then there's a compartment in the top of the hat and he reaches through with a spring and grabs a rabbit out of the box under it.
[00:48:58.266 --> 00:49:00.147]  And you're like, well, I can't see it.
[00:49:00.948 --> 00:49:03.209]  Look, I'm telling you, there's a rabbit in that box.
[00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:05.431]  Go kick the box over, there's a rabbit in it.
[00:49:06.363 --> 00:49:07.865]  And they go, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:49:07.905 --> 00:49:09.967]  There's no rabbits in that box.
[00:49:10.027 --> 00:49:11.789]  He's magically materializing it.
[00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:13.591]  No, I'm not the conspiracy theorist.
[00:49:13.932 --> 00:49:18.757]  I'm telling you how these criminals are engaged in an open conspiracy against you.
[00:49:19.438 --> 00:49:26.466]  And they're so weak, they've got to dumb you down from birth so that they can manage you instead of empowering humanity.
[00:49:27.407 --> 00:49:28.488]  Now, I'm going to go to this piece.
[00:49:28.508 --> 00:49:29.529]  We're skipping this network break.
[00:49:29.849 --> 00:49:33.632]  Stations should not play ads over this because this is a network break.
[00:49:33.652 --> 00:49:37.976]  This costs us a lot of money to skip these ads, but I do it because airtime is so precious.
[00:49:38.716 --> 00:49:46.403]  Let's go ahead and go to the MSNBC piece, and I'll stop it here and there and analyze it, but I've basically already broken it down.
[00:49:47.438 --> 00:49:55.767]  They are so scared, they're saying, oh my gosh, GOP, ah ha ha, you're discredited, because more and more of you are really saying what you think.
[00:49:56.067 --> 00:49:58.269]  More and more of you are talking, you know, like radicals.
[00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.392]  More and more of you are being insurgents.
[00:50:00.732 --> 00:50:02.294]  More and more of you are being terrorists.
[00:50:02.694 --> 00:50:09.822]  Oh no, oh no, we're supposed to stage a revolution ourselves against you, and when you fight back as counterrevolutionaries, we're supposed to call you terrorists.
[00:50:10.242 --> 00:50:16.924]  You're not supposed to get on the offense with the moral high ground and call us out as criminals for Fast and Furious and Benghazi and all the rest of it.
[00:50:17.145 --> 00:50:18.665]  You're not supposed to restore the Republic.
[00:50:19.105 --> 00:50:20.526]  You're supposed to let us take your kids.
[00:50:20.546 --> 00:50:22.346]  You're supposed to let us break up your families.
[00:50:22.566 --> 00:50:24.247]  You're supposed to let us feed you GMO.
[00:50:24.487 --> 00:50:26.248]  You're supposed to let us have the moral high ground.
[00:50:26.408 --> 00:50:28.229]  You're supposed to let us lecture you all day.
[00:50:28.449 --> 00:50:30.689]  You're supposed to let us be the boss and do what we say.
[00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:34.751]  Don't listen to this one Texan who tells you you don't have to follow them.
[00:50:37.591 --> 00:50:40.454]  And then they try to patronize you and say you're following me.
[00:50:41.074 --> 00:50:43.156]  This is not the Jonesification of the world.
[00:50:43.376 --> 00:50:45.318]  This is survival instinct kicking in.
[00:50:47.079 --> 00:50:50.102]  And you know in your gut, but also intellectually, I'm real.
[00:50:52.564 --> 00:50:53.785]  I'm real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:53.885 --> 00:50:54.766]  Red-blooded.
[00:50:55.106 --> 00:50:55.687]  Big heart.
[00:50:55.927 --> 00:50:56.608]  Pumps blood.
[00:50:58.223 --> 00:50:59.244]  I don't like being a slave.
[00:50:59.264 --> 00:51:00.105]  I take it personal.
[00:51:00.445 --> 00:51:01.106]  I'm committed.
[00:51:01.787 --> 00:51:03.348]  I don't have any fear of these people.
[00:51:03.368 --> 00:51:07.753]  I only have fear that I'm too weak to really smash into the enemy.
[00:51:08.834 --> 00:51:11.857]  All I want is to bring this scum down and see humanity go to the next level.
[00:51:12.518 --> 00:51:13.259]  That's all I want.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.121]  And I know we're going to beat them.
[00:51:16.854 --> 00:51:17.494]  And I love you.
[00:51:18.034 --> 00:51:21.736]  And I love those of you that stand and work and bust your ass in this system.
[00:51:21.756 --> 00:51:26.357]  They're trying to make it as hard as they can to break up your families and shut down our society.
[00:51:26.397 --> 00:51:27.438]  They're waging war on us.
[00:51:27.698 --> 00:51:30.179]  But when humans know they're under attack, they get stronger.
[00:51:30.499 --> 00:51:34.180]  If you don't know you're under attack, you get weaker and learn to live under the slavery.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:37.161]  But when you know you're under attack, it only makes you stronger.
[00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:41.303]  So admit you're under attack and then take action against the enemy.
[00:51:42.076 --> 00:51:50.244]  Let's go to the enemy transmission directly from the White House, directed at the GOP and the real Libertarian Tea Party that is taking it over.
[00:51:50.504 --> 00:51:51.926]  They call us an infection.
[00:51:53.227 --> 00:51:55.610]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are the cure.
[00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:56.270]  Here it is.
[00:51:57.378 --> 00:52:00.099]  Heller says these men and women are patriots.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:05.522]  So does the website InfoWars, a paranoid online haven run by Alex Jones.
[00:52:05.943 --> 00:52:21.771]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist whose stories often make their way from his website InfoWars, where on any day you can find headlines about vaccines, mass fluoridation, and the 9-11 cover-up, into the so-called mainstream GOP establishment.
[00:52:22.331 --> 00:52:25.773]  Alex Jones was a champion of Clive and Bundy from the very beginning.
[00:52:26.033 --> 00:52:33.078]  Because he's saying he'll do whatever he has to to not be, you know, have his grazing rights stolen by these pirates.
[00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:37.542]  Drudge elevated the story and it made its way onto Fox News' Airwaves.
[00:52:38.303 --> 00:52:47.550]  Brannan is a connoisseur of a wide range of Jones-backed conspiracies, from Obamacare as socialist plot, to vaccines, to something called Agenda 21.
[00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:53.314]  Someone who is well acquainted with the right's favorite conspiracy theories, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.
[00:52:53.594 --> 00:52:57.457]  I'm pleased to be here to support a fellow physician, to support Greg Brannan.
[00:52:57.697 --> 00:52:59.779]  Rand Paul is also a fan of Alex Jones.
[00:53:00.179 --> 00:53:02.701]  He's been a guest on Jones' radio show over the years.
[00:53:03.401 --> 00:53:12.248]  Paul apparently takes his cues from Jones on fringe obsessions like Bilderberg, a yearly meeting of people that Jones believes secretly run the world.
[00:53:12.808 --> 00:53:14.489]  Do you know anything about the Bilderberg group?
[00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:16.551]  Only what I've learned from Alex Jones.
[00:53:17.712 --> 00:53:23.276]  Do you know, for the people who don't know what's going on, can you tell people who are the Bilderberg group, if you feel comfortable doing so?
[00:53:23.336 --> 00:53:33.324]  Yeah, well I'm not probably the world's expert on it, but I think it's people who get together, who are very wealthy people, who I think manipulate and use government to their own personal advantage.
[00:53:33.344 --> 00:53:39.188]  For more and more Republicans, if you're not out on the fringe, you're not in the party's mainstream.
[00:53:40.229 --> 00:53:46.715]  I've actually seen this discussed in all sorts of corners of the right-wing media and not just in the most conspiratorial circles.
[00:53:47.015 --> 00:53:55.382]  That the reason that the BLM came for Cliven Bundy's ranch is so that you could help the Chinese build a solar plant on that land.
[00:53:56.563 --> 00:53:57.403]  Back it up a little bit.
[00:53:57.864 --> 00:54:01.006]  And again, the full piece is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:01.647 --> 00:54:07.331]  Again, in the BLM's website, it said, as an environmental easement next to the corridor,
[00:54:08.112 --> 00:54:08.833]  That's how it works.
[00:54:08.913 --> 00:54:12.255]  They get to use one area, then they have to have an area that's in easement that's not being used.
[00:54:12.696 --> 00:54:16.179]  We're going to use the 600,000 acres of Clyde Bundy's rangeland.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:22.724]  Now, they took it off the BLM website, they took it off the Google site, we have it saved, Scribd has it saved.
[00:54:23.224 --> 00:54:24.325]  They do not deny it's real.
[00:54:25.266 --> 00:54:30.590]  They just come out and say that, you know, there's nothing going on with Harry Reid's son.
[00:54:31.431 --> 00:54:37.316]  Rory Reid is on record in over 100 publications, Reuters, AP, you name it, as a scandal
[00:54:38.373 --> 00:54:42.840]  That his dad got the deal with the Chinese who put him on the company board.
[00:54:44.563 --> 00:54:50.271]  But they prey on the MSNBC audience and sit there and say, huh, you know what's even crazier?
[00:54:50.492 --> 00:54:53.276]  They claim you're with the Chinese in the land grab, huh!
[00:54:55.779 --> 00:54:56.540]  Tell me another one.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.161]  Tell me Bill Clinton lies next.
[00:54:59.002 --> 00:55:00.443]  That's even better!
[00:55:00.703 --> 00:55:04.806]  Tell me they ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:55:05.147 --> 00:55:08.509]  Tell me Obamacare is increasing prices and you can keep your doctor.
[00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:10.131]  Or that you built your business.
[00:55:10.531 --> 00:55:13.714]  That's even funnier!
[00:55:14.314 --> 00:55:15.295]  I'm sorry, let's go back to it.
[00:55:16.508 --> 00:55:22.972]  I've actually seen this discussed in all sorts of corners of the right-wing media and not just in the most conspiratorial circles.
[00:55:23.272 --> 00:55:31.597]  That the reason that the BLM came for Cliven Bundy's ranch is so that you could help the Chinese build a solar plant on that land.
[00:55:31.617 --> 00:55:34.299]  Do you want to respond to that allegation?
[00:55:35.652 --> 00:55:36.332]  It's ridiculous.
[00:55:36.352 --> 00:55:37.893]  That'd be a great story if it were true.
[00:55:37.953 --> 00:55:42.274]  I don't represent anybody Chinese or otherwise that has an interest in developing anything on that land.
[00:55:42.334 --> 00:55:44.475]  I don't know what he was thinking.
[00:55:44.575 --> 00:55:44.895]  It paused.
[00:55:44.935 --> 00:55:45.335]  It paused.
[00:55:46.155 --> 00:55:49.156]  That land is listed in the documents as the environmental easement.
[00:55:49.557 --> 00:55:50.817]  You notice he said he's a lawyer.
[00:55:51.177 --> 00:55:55.719]  He goes, I don't represent the Chinese or anybody else on issues with that land.
[00:55:55.779 --> 00:55:56.699]  Back it up ten seconds.
[00:55:57.756 --> 00:56:01.719]  This is why they go, Alex Jones got caught lying again, not 1.6 billion.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.322]  It was 23 million bullets, Alex!
[00:56:05.142 --> 00:56:09.506]  And they do one line item of all the stuff that was 1.6 billion, now 2.6 or more.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.461]  Remember, there's no drones either in the skies.
[00:56:13.521 --> 00:56:14.461]  Alex Jones lied about that.
[00:56:15.921 --> 00:56:21.743]  There's no tax in Obamacare for small businesses of $5,000 per employee, even though it's hitting us this year.
[00:56:22.104 --> 00:56:23.724]  Matt Drudge says he's going to pay the fine.
[00:56:24.224 --> 00:56:25.205]  He's a liar, folks!
[00:56:25.225 --> 00:56:28.366]  There's no fees, even though they're setting up the IRS to take them.
[00:56:30.146 --> 00:56:39.010]  Let's go back to him lying to you with a Cheshire Cat grin confidence game with the male version of Rachel Maddow.
[00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:39.310]  Here it is.
[00:56:41.284 --> 00:56:41.964]  It's ridiculous.
[00:56:41.984 --> 00:56:43.505]  That'd be a great story if it were true.
[00:56:43.565 --> 00:56:48.026]  I don't represent anybody, Chinese or otherwise, that has an interest in developing anything on that land.
[00:56:49.166 --> 00:56:50.306]  I don't know what he was thinking.
[00:56:50.326 --> 00:56:52.247]  You know, he tends to be a reasonable guy.
[00:56:52.267 --> 00:56:54.347]  He supported immigration reform.
[00:56:54.407 --> 00:56:57.108]  He supported an extension of unemployment insurance.
[00:56:57.848 --> 00:57:08.831]  Maybe he just had a bad day last Friday, but I think those were unfortunate comments, and anything that is said that gives credence to those kind of ideas, I think, is misplaced.
[00:57:09.011 --> 00:57:11.257]  What about your father calling the folks there domestic terrorists?
[00:57:11.277 --> 00:57:12.901]  There's been a lot of backlash over that.
[00:57:13.222 --> 00:57:16.831]  That phraseology from him seemed to me a bit hyperbolic.
[00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:17.993]  What do you think of that?
[00:57:19.426 --> 00:57:27.071]  Well, if my job was to respond and comment on everything my dad said, I'd have another full-time job, so I'm going to decline that request.
[00:57:27.291 --> 00:57:27.611]  Oh, really?
[00:57:27.631 --> 00:57:28.292]  No, own what daddy did.
[00:57:28.432 --> 00:57:37.037]  I would say, though, that anybody that looks at that situation would realize that what those people are doing is simply inappropriate in America.
[00:57:37.057 --> 00:57:42.561]  If you don't agree with the government, you can't point... Well, they tried to come out with signs, and you tasered them and beat them up.
[00:57:43.507 --> 00:57:47.210]  You know, your dad appointed the BLM head that is part of land grabbing nationwide, not just there.
[00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:49.392]  They're about to grab 900,000 acres in Texas.
[00:57:49.712 --> 00:57:50.413]  They're just taking it.
[00:57:50.933 --> 00:57:52.194]  Claiming anything on the river is theirs.
[00:57:52.594 --> 00:57:53.655]  They're going to start with the Red River.
[00:57:54.876 --> 00:57:56.938]  And I'm sure you'll get a slice of that, you little bastard.
[00:57:58.039 --> 00:57:59.400]  I mean, that's mean to bastards.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.262]  I am so sick of these gangsters.
[00:58:01.722 --> 00:58:03.203]  These chicken-necked gangsters.
[00:58:04.384 --> 00:58:06.126]  These Vegas mob bosses.
[00:58:07.307 --> 00:58:08.608]  Literally, there it is.
[00:58:10.165 --> 00:58:13.068]  There it is, it's 90,000 acres of Texas land, excuse me.
[00:58:13.508 --> 00:58:14.389]  BLMI's that.
[00:58:14.849 --> 00:58:15.930]  That's what's going on here.
[00:58:17.552 --> 00:58:20.174]  And you show up with guns and everything, that's inappropriate.
[00:58:20.194 --> 00:58:25.800]  Look, I'm gonna, that's a few snippets of it, I'm gonna air the whole thing unedited at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:58:27.017 --> 00:58:29.758]  From the start, where they demonized the Bundys and more.
[00:58:29.798 --> 00:58:30.578]  But that's all coming up.
[00:58:30.858 --> 00:58:31.958]  I didn't plug anything this hour.
[00:58:31.978 --> 00:58:32.478]  Skip breaks.

[00:58:59.005 --> 00:59:01.606]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:59:33.777 --> 00:59:35.718]  This is not a low-grade formula.

[01:00:01.982 --> 01:00:03.925]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.386 --> 01:00:07.090]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:14.511]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:16.192]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:16.952 --> 01:00:18.032]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:18.692 --> 01:00:19.512]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:21.233]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:25.454]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.014 --> 01:00:30.115]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.576 --> 01:00:34.856]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:00:36.016 --> 01:00:37.537]  We are the tip of the star.
[01:00:38.157 --> 01:00:40.498]  The 50 stars up there on that flag.
[01:00:40.558 --> 01:00:41.878]  Can we restore
[01:00:43.464 --> 01:00:44.045]  The Republic.
[01:00:45.306 --> 01:00:47.227]  How do you say that in Spanish?
[01:00:47.688 --> 01:00:50.230]  How do you say it, guys?
[01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.511]  You can jump on the mic.
[01:00:54.113 --> 01:00:55.334]  You guys gotta turn the mic on.
[01:00:55.594 --> 01:00:56.796]  Punta de la Estrella.
[01:00:56.976 --> 01:00:57.316]  There you go.
[01:00:57.336 --> 01:00:58.017]  There's my cousin.
[01:00:59.118 --> 01:01:00.258]  My cousin was born in Guatemala.
[01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:01.319]  He speaks pretty good Spanish.
[01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:04.002]  Punta de la Estrella?
[01:01:04.682 --> 01:01:05.243]  Did I say it right?
[01:01:07.341 --> 01:01:17.089]  Anyways, I was trying to say tip of the spear in Spanish the other day and I said point of the star at dinner with my parents and kids and so I guess it's kind of the point of the spear, point of the star.
[01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:19.211]  How do you say point of the spear in Spanish?
[01:01:20.732 --> 01:01:21.292]  That'd be good.
[01:01:22.333 --> 01:01:23.214]  Go ahead and jump on the mic.
[01:01:24.795 --> 01:01:25.916]  You know how to say point of the spear?
[01:01:27.577 --> 01:01:28.818]  Well, does Nico know how to?
[01:01:29.459 --> 01:01:30.179]  We're looking it up.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.842]  You guys need to know how to say spear in Spanish.
[01:01:35.043 --> 01:01:36.084]  How do you say it in Latin?
[01:01:38.543 --> 01:01:44.047]  Well, yeah, I didn't even know that now that you say it.
[01:01:44.127 --> 01:01:46.228]  Hey, anyways, side issue.
[01:01:46.248 --> 01:01:55.074]  We're going to open the phones up in the next segment, get into some other news, but I want to finish when we come back, because this is a short segment, with the control of the media.
[01:01:55.475 --> 01:01:57.376]  Look, I'm nothing really that special, folks.
[01:01:57.776 --> 01:01:59.237]  I've studied tyranny, studied history.
[01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:00.458]  I know how tyranny operates.
[01:02:01.179 --> 01:02:02.980]  I've read so many history books, it repeats itself.
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.501]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[01:02:04.902 --> 01:02:06.643]  I forget who said that, but it's certainly true.
[01:02:08.797 --> 01:02:10.798]  Who did say those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it?
[01:02:11.498 --> 01:02:15.600]  Was that Lord Acton or did he say power corrupts and absolute power tends to corrupt?
[01:02:16.281 --> 01:02:16.881]  Absolutely.
[01:02:16.921 --> 01:02:17.842]  That's the actual quote.
[01:02:19.142 --> 01:02:21.523]  But we are the tip of the spear.
[01:02:24.025 --> 01:02:24.805]  The tip of the lance.
[01:02:26.386 --> 01:02:28.287]  And the system doesn't like it.
[01:02:29.554 --> 01:02:32.595]  But it shows how powerless they are when good people stand up.
[01:02:32.955 --> 01:02:38.877]  When you realize that Clinton was deathly afraid of the internet when Joseph Farah was first using it in 1993.
[01:02:40.658 --> 01:02:43.739]  And Matt Drudge was developing his internet list using email.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.200]  They were already watching them hatefully then.
[01:02:48.801 --> 01:02:50.802]  Knowing that they were planning a criminal takeover.
[01:02:50.842 --> 01:02:51.582]  It's Edmund Burke.
[01:02:52.422 --> 01:02:54.103]  Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[01:02:56.348 --> 01:03:04.811]  And so we're here simply pointing out that we're going down a very authoritarian, very tyrannical road, and we need to stand up against it and be aware of it.
[01:03:10.773 --> 01:03:20.796]  I mean, there's a bunch of new news, but the ranch is a microcosm of government oppression, hypocrisy, and tyranny that we look into and see our own reflection as a society in.
[01:03:21.636 --> 01:03:27.618]  And that's why it resonates, and that's why the system doesn't know what to do, because you know what they say in the movie Ants.
[01:03:27.658 --> 01:03:29.019]  I want to come in with that intro if we can.
[01:03:29.479 --> 01:03:33.280]  If you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up.
[01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:36.741]  They want to tell you you're worthless.
[01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:43.844]  They want to tell you that your words against them won't be heard, and that you don't have power, and that resistance is futile.
[01:03:45.244 --> 01:03:47.625]  It's all words, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:03:48.585 --> 01:03:50.946]  The Twilight Zone intro we have, we'll play that at the bottom of the hour.
[01:03:52.156 --> 01:04:15.135]  And the truth is, I'm only one guy who 22 years ago got out of high school and was going to community college and knew anti-American propaganda, anti-freedom when I heard it, who knew re-education when I heard it, who was smart enough to know what I was seeing and said, there's a problem, I better do something.
[01:04:16.004 --> 01:04:27.312]  And then when I began to stand up and fight and went on AXS TV 19 years ago, and radio 18 years ago, or almost 19 years ago now, people smarter than me gave me info and helped me.
[01:04:27.912 --> 01:04:32.115]  And they were mainly retired veterans, current military, firefighters, and police officers.
[01:04:33.296 --> 01:04:41.622]  And it's funny today, and engineers, and people inside the system, and executives, and patriots, and writers,
[01:04:43.956 --> 01:04:48.377]  And by the time I'd only been on air seven years, Kurt Vonnegut was a listener.
[01:04:48.617 --> 01:04:49.377]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:04:50.117 --> 01:04:54.678]  It's a testament to what you can do standing up and starting that journey.
[01:04:54.898 --> 01:04:56.779]  And there are people out there a lot smarter and better than I am.
[01:04:57.199 --> 01:05:05.421]  And I'm here getting the word out to rise up and raise up and activate other people that are going to bring down the New World Order.
[01:05:05.721 --> 01:05:06.921]  We're building an army.
[01:05:09.659 --> 01:05:13.662]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:05:13.682 --> 01:05:17.845]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:05:18.065 --> 01:05:21.488]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:05:21.728 --> 01:05:24.610]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:32.115]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:05:32.355 --> 01:05:35.978]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:05:36.238 --> 01:05:40.480]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:46.583]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:05:46.623 --> 01:05:50.425]  Fluoride, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:05:50.565 --> 01:05:53.107]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:05:53.307 --> 01:05:54.668]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:05:54.808 --> 01:05:56.048]  It's time to take action.
[01:05:56.188 --> 01:05:57.889]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:06:09.696 --> 01:06:16.861]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:06:16.981 --> 01:06:19.142]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:24.525]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:06:24.686 --> 01:06:29.809]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:06:29.929 --> 01:06:33.031]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:06:33.311 --> 01:06:37.234]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:06:37.434 --> 01:06:41.757]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:06:41.837 --> 01:06:51.984]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:06:52.184 --> 01:06:56.567]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:06:56.667 --> 01:07:03.111]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:08.955]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.

[01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:26.888]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:27.188 --> 01:07:31.893]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:32.073 --> 01:07:38.799]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:38.879 --> 01:07:45.966]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:46.046 --> 01:07:52.912]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:53.072 --> 01:07:57.413]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:57.533 --> 01:08:00.814]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:08.916]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:08.936 --> 01:08:09.136]  USA!
[01:08:09.156 --> 01:08:09.216]  USA!
[01:08:09.256 --> 01:08:09.376]  USA!
[01:08:09.416 --> 01:08:09.476]  USA!
[01:08:10.497 --> 01:08:11.917]  USA!
[01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:25.199]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:30.402]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:08:30.942 --> 01:08:34.965]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[01:08:35.786 --> 01:08:37.066]  It's not about food.
[01:08:37.787 --> 01:08:40.369]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:08:47.037 --> 01:08:48.758]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:49.178 --> 01:08:52.179]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:54.960]  It's not about the tortoise.
[01:08:56.381 --> 01:09:03.644]  It's about bankrupting every rancher nationwide, as the federal judge ruled just a few months ago in Nevada.
[01:09:04.284 --> 01:09:09.567]  Judge Jones called it a, quote, criminal conspiracy to bankrupt ranchers.
[01:09:10.615 --> 01:09:14.617]  By raising grazing fees to levels designed to bankrupt them.
[01:09:15.118 --> 01:09:22.082]  And it turned out that the Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club and others designed the program to bankrupt this entire country.
[01:09:22.542 --> 01:09:24.123]  It's called Agenda 21.
[01:09:26.064 --> 01:09:34.709]  And coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to play unedited the first five minutes of the MSNBC piece where they totally demonize.
[01:09:37.782 --> 01:09:40.824]  These people think the Chinese are involved in an energy deal.
[01:09:42.425 --> 01:09:43.746]  Rory's saying it ain't so.
[01:09:44.166 --> 01:09:46.347]  These people think there's a thing called Zoom 21.
[01:09:46.387 --> 01:09:47.188]  They're crazy!
[01:09:49.409 --> 01:09:54.292]  Just a UNESCO treaty that Bush Sr.
[01:09:54.332 --> 01:09:56.153]  signed onto, but the Congress didn't ratify.
[01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:04.959]  But in a larger issue, the reason this story is so important is they demonized the Drudge Report.
[01:10:08.098 --> 01:10:08.599]  And others.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.082]  And say that we're insurgents.
[01:10:12.802 --> 01:10:13.182]  And you know what?
[01:10:13.303 --> 01:10:22.971]  I guess if we have an occupied government run by the globalists that plan on looting the nation and making us poor for political control, making us dependent, I guess in an occupied America we are insurgents.
[01:10:24.132 --> 01:10:25.073]  What's left of America?
[01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:28.211]  and basic values.
[01:10:47.842 --> 01:11:00.225]  Attack on camera people everywhere by police under orders, the moves to bring in internet taxation, SOPA, CISPA, this new secret treaty that got leaked that Obama wants to sign with Asia to restrict free speech.
[01:11:00.245 --> 01:11:01.945]  He wants to sign it with the Chinese government.
[01:11:02.545 --> 01:11:07.126]  The Chinese government lobbying to have movies not be released that criticize communism.
[01:11:07.466 --> 01:11:08.486]  That's in the news all the time.
[01:11:09.467 --> 01:11:10.707]  From Red Dawn to X-Men.
[01:11:12.264 --> 01:11:16.967]  But MSNBC says there's no communist Chinese influence going on in America.
[01:11:17.768 --> 01:11:28.716]  When Bill Clinton was being exposed for missile secrets on the Drudge Report back in 97, I remember NBC News saying, is it racist to talk about Chinese spies?
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.161]  Is it racist to talk about Russian spies?
[01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:34.263]  Or Israeli spies?
[01:11:34.463 --> 01:11:35.684]  Or British spies?
[01:11:36.064 --> 01:11:40.927]  No, I think it's about our country being infiltrated by outside powers that have their interests and we have ours.
[01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:43.909]  But see, America is globally captured now.
[01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:50.814]  American elite developed the plan for planetary world government with the British government and created the United Nations.
[01:11:51.435 --> 01:11:53.076]  People always say, get us out of the UN.
[01:11:54.926 --> 01:12:04.990]  The robber barons couldn't politically defeat the American people by 1906, so they went and brought British intelligence over to set up Pratt House at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:12:05.290 --> 01:12:06.370]  This is all declassified.
[01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:15.513]  To use the British Empire intelligence model re-established here in the US to form the new super UK power structure.
[01:12:16.274 --> 01:12:17.974]  That doesn't mean England runs it all.
[01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:22.896]  Now America is the empire and actually treats the British arrogantly.
[01:12:23.615 --> 01:12:28.496]  The British people and the people of the UK in general have paid for the planetary world government.
[01:12:34.118 --> 01:12:37.799]  And I'm going to go over this document for folks here on air.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.880]  Did we print that last hour?
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:40.920]  Thank you.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.021]  I knew it was in the printer.
[01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:42.661]  May I please have it?
[01:12:43.161 --> 01:12:43.481]  Thank you.
[01:12:44.321 --> 01:12:48.062]  This document that I hold in my little paws.
[01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:50.263]  Let me copy Rush Limbaugh.
[01:12:51.443 --> 01:12:53.084]  This document that I hold here
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.683]  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
[01:12:57.703 --> 01:12:58.745]  Let me do it properly.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:07.882]  All right, there we go.
[01:13:07.902 --> 01:13:13.984]  MSNBC smears Bundy supporters as insurgent attacks Infowars and drugs.
[01:13:14.004 --> 01:13:18.426]  We're going to get to that in a moment and go over the latest in this news.
[01:13:18.846 --> 01:13:22.148]  Battle lines hardening in Nevada cattle ranch standoff with feds.
[01:13:22.368 --> 01:13:26.230]  LA Times, BLM eyes 90,000 acres of Texas land.
[01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:28.391]  They're going to take every major piece of land across rivers.
[01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:31.332]  That's been the Waterways Executive Order plan for a while.
[01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:38.190]  BLM confirms it killed six of Bundy's cattle, including prized bulls.
[01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:40.551]  They first denied that and called us conspiracy theorists.
[01:13:40.571 --> 01:13:41.192]  That's right, Barb.
[01:13:42.032 --> 01:13:42.872]  I blame both sides.
[01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:45.033]  Oklahoma militia members joined fight against feds.
[01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:48.995]  Nevada standoff, a symptom of increasing authoritarianism.
[01:13:49.035 --> 01:13:50.556]  A Ron Paul report we're going to be playing.
[01:13:52.397 --> 01:13:56.659]  IRS revokes conservative group's tax-exempt status over anti-Clinton statements.
[01:13:57.882 --> 01:14:01.043]  IRS rule change seen as limiting free speech for non-profit organizations.
[01:14:01.363 --> 01:14:02.403]  We're going to go over all that.
[01:14:02.684 --> 01:14:07.605]  But first off, I want to go over this document.
[01:14:09.586 --> 01:14:12.987]  Withdrawal Redaction Sheet.
[01:14:13.047 --> 01:14:25.611]  So folks try to go in, researchers and people, to the Clinton Library to get the hoard of his documents that are deposited in the bowels of the Infernal Facility.
[01:14:29.019 --> 01:14:39.146]  And this is only 20 something pages, if you don't count the cover sheets, of 300 plus that were allowed to be released.
[01:14:40.187 --> 01:14:55.758]  And in the document that I'm showing you here, from the Clinton Presidential Library, it talks about how they've got to deal with the Western Journalism Center, conservative newsletters like Ron Paul's,
[01:14:57.779 --> 01:15:02.764]  The American Spectator and the Pittsburgh Tribune Review.
[01:15:02.784 --> 01:15:04.966]  Now imagine, this is the White House.
[01:15:05.367 --> 01:15:18.881]  Then they say, stories that first develop here, then percolate into the Wall Street Journal, Washington Times, New York Post, and then from there percolate into the controlled, total controlled press.
[01:15:20.579 --> 01:15:22.201]  These operations are controlled pretty much now.
[01:15:22.502 --> 01:15:23.523]  Washington Times does some good work.
[01:15:23.903 --> 01:15:25.285]  So does the Wall Street Journal, but not as much.
[01:15:25.325 --> 01:15:26.546]  New York Post does some good stuff.
[01:15:26.827 --> 01:15:32.613]  The point is that you can see the strata, and they talk about how then it flows out of alternative media that was alternative.
[01:15:33.114 --> 01:15:35.317]  In its embryonic phase, Clinton wanted to abort it.
[01:15:36.581 --> 01:15:47.950]  With audits and harassment and demonization, and then it percolates into the Wall Street Journal and others, and then they say into the Washington Post and other publications, and then into the New York Times.
[01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:58.698]  And they go on in here, you ought to go read it for yourself, it's up on Infowars.com, to actually say they then can't control all the info, and it gives the general public a voice.
[01:15:58.938 --> 01:16:00.960]  Oh, you cannot have any alternative.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:05.763]  You can't have talk radio, they're trying to bring back in the Fairness Doctrine, where my show would be banned.
[01:16:06.624 --> 01:16:08.386]  They're trying to bring all of this in.
[01:16:08.406 --> 01:16:09.928]  In fact, quoting from the document.
[01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:12.932]  This is how the stream works.
[01:16:13.072 --> 01:16:17.818]  Firstly, well-funded right-wing think tanks and individuals underwrite conservative newsletters.
[01:16:17.878 --> 01:16:18.639]  That's not true.
[01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:19.700]  No one is underwriting us.
[01:16:20.281 --> 01:16:23.465]  And newspapers such as the Western Journalism Center.
[01:16:24.389 --> 01:16:28.530]  No, they funded that with donations and with people buying the newsletter, I happen to know.
[01:16:28.891 --> 01:16:31.251]  The American Spectator and the Pittsburgh Tribune Review.
[01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:38.714]  Next, the stories are reposted on the internet where they are bounced all over the world from the internet.
[01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:43.756]  The stories are bounced into the mainstream media through one of two ways.
[01:16:44.276 --> 01:16:49.758]  One, the story will be picked up by the British tabloids and covered as a major story.
[01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:54.478]  From which the American right off the center mainstream media.
[01:16:55.305 --> 01:16:59.288]  Wall Street Journal, Washington Times and New York Post will then pick up the story.
[01:16:59.588 --> 01:17:05.072]  Two, the story will be bounced directly from the internet to the right-of-center mainstream American media.
[01:17:05.512 --> 01:17:10.775]  After the mainstream right-of-center American media covers the story, congressional committees will look into the story.
[01:17:10.895 --> 01:17:13.997]  Oh, don't look into Cattlegate or the murders or the missile secrets.
[01:17:14.558 --> 01:17:23.664]  After Congress looks into the story, the story now has the legitimacy to be covered by the remainder of the American mainstream press as a real story.
[01:17:24.044 --> 01:17:24.985]  Now, let's stop right there.
[01:17:26.257 --> 01:17:27.997]  What do they say on CNN, MSNBC?
[01:17:28.417 --> 01:17:30.538]  Oh my gosh, Alex Jones says there's drones.
[01:17:30.978 --> 01:17:33.538]  Alex Jones says Fast and Furious is staged to get the guns.
[01:17:34.018 --> 01:17:35.819]  Alex Jones says there's billions of bullets.
[01:17:36.199 --> 01:17:36.859]  None of it's true.
[01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:37.819]  He's insane.
[01:17:38.039 --> 01:17:39.379]  But look at this Republican congressman.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:40.600]  They're having hearings on it.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.840]  Meanwhile, they bought all the bullets.
[01:17:45.501 --> 01:17:46.201]  See how they do that?
[01:17:47.141 --> 01:17:52.582]  Meanwhile, they did stage Fast and Furious, CBS News had to admit, because we already broke the information.
[01:17:55.063 --> 01:17:58.347]  And again, who can really run their blockade every time is DrudgeReport.com.
[01:17:58.748 --> 01:18:00.650]  It's very hard for us, but we're still able to do it now.
[01:18:01.271 --> 01:18:04.516]  Break through directly and really have them freak out.
[01:18:07.419 --> 01:18:09.883]  But when it goes on Drudge, it assuredly breaks out.
[01:18:12.779 --> 01:18:14.380]  That's why they're so upset.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:20.584]  But now, more and more, there's other alternative media, and people understand the paradigm now, and they're decompartmentalized.
[01:18:21.345 --> 01:18:24.066]  But when you read these memos, it's exactly how the media is run today.
[01:18:24.386 --> 01:18:27.028]  It says, we've got to call it conspiracy theories.
[01:18:27.889 --> 01:18:32.652]  They go on to say, anything coming out on the internet, we need to call it conspiracy theories.
[01:18:33.632 --> 01:18:37.535]  Even if it's documented, we just call it a conspiracy theory and say it isn't mainstream.
[01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:42.682]  It was the Clintons that wrote up the term mainstream media, alternative media.
[01:18:43.123 --> 01:18:45.230]  And when we adopt the idea...
[01:18:46.257 --> 01:18:48.359]  That we're the alternative media and they're the mainstream media?
[01:18:48.419 --> 01:18:48.519]  No.
[01:18:48.799 --> 01:18:56.985]  They're the dinosaur, decepticon, globalist, corporate, Federal Reserve, anti-liberty, anti-family, the authors of our discontent.
[01:18:57.265 --> 01:18:58.046]  They're the bad guys.
[01:18:58.126 --> 01:18:58.706]  I mean, look at them.
[01:18:58.726 --> 01:19:08.234]  The liars, caught lying, caught cheating, taxpayer funded, bailout funded, stimulus money funded, and their ratings are in the toilet now, too!
[01:19:08.334 --> 01:19:10.856]  So, you are the small media.
[01:19:10.896 --> 01:19:12.137]  You're the vestigial media.
[01:19:12.417 --> 01:19:14.859]  You're the imploded kleptocrat media.
[01:19:17.202 --> 01:19:21.545]  And in the memos, in the memo, they've got emails, they've got examples.
[01:19:21.845 --> 01:19:25.308]  Put that Drudge article back up and I'll cover that.
[01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:27.930]  Drudge Report Archives.
[01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:29.751]  Special Reports.
[01:19:31.212 --> 01:19:31.752]  Shareware.
[01:19:31.812 --> 01:19:34.654]  Clinton to offer new missile defense tech to Russia, China.
[01:19:35.055 --> 01:19:43.320]  See, that's the type of thing that they're freaking out in the Clinton files about, is that Clinton would dare give missile secrets to China.
[01:19:43.681 --> 01:19:46.303]  And see now, we always knew they didn't like Drudge breaking that.
[01:19:47.276 --> 01:19:49.418]  So now we have the documents, see?
[01:19:50.899 --> 01:20:06.553]  They don't want their treason, their sedition, their criminality being exposed, and now they want to call us terrorists, and they want to use the NDAA on us, and they want to arrest us, and they want to say I'm in the Boston bombing, and I'm deeply racist, because they think their audience is so dumb, and they're desperate.
[01:20:06.753 --> 01:20:07.073]  Why?

[01:24:24.187 --> 01:24:25.527]  No, you don't, Clinton.
[01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:27.289]  No.
[01:24:28.049 --> 01:24:30.471]  You know, your heart's not like mine, El Clinton.
[01:24:31.671 --> 01:24:32.332]  El Patrona.
[01:24:33.372 --> 01:24:35.114]  Clinton's La Patrona.
[01:24:35.694 --> 01:24:36.735]  Hillary's El Patrona.
[01:24:37.135 --> 01:24:41.518]  It's hard to turn that off.
[01:24:49.179 --> 01:24:49.739]  That's right.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:25:03.905]  Imagine living in a country where we get the documents that the Clintons were targeting the Western Journalism Center.
[01:25:06.886 --> 01:25:14.469]  Media Matters is their front group today putting out the propaganda to counter groups like Media Bypass.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:19.001]  It's absolutely incredible.
[01:25:19.041 --> 01:25:28.366]  We already know all this, but this document at the Clinton Library, and we got less than 30 pages of it, of 300 plus, here's the index for TV viewers.
[01:25:28.386 --> 01:25:29.607]  I'm going to read it for radio listeners.
[01:25:31.248 --> 01:25:33.349]  Communication Stream of Conspiracy Commerce.
[01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:37.551]  Right-wing Publications.
[01:25:37.631 --> 01:25:38.912]  Western Journalism Center.
[01:25:38.952 --> 01:25:39.532]  Joseph Farrell.
[01:25:39.552 --> 01:25:40.372]  World Net Daily Today.
[01:25:41.813 --> 01:25:42.734]  Media Bypass.
[01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:45.171]  Now look at that, Media Bypass.
[01:25:45.311 --> 01:25:51.256]  I started writing for Media Bypass in 1996, and it only had a circulation, I think, of like 100,000.
[01:25:53.077 --> 01:25:55.820]  But I wrote articles, they contacted me, they were looking for fighters.
[01:25:57.161 --> 01:25:58.782]  I need to get the head of Media Bypass on.
[01:25:58.802 --> 01:26:06.028]  I mean, they got audited, they got harassed, they got 60 minutes pieces against them, just for putting out stuff that's pretty milquetoast today.
[01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:10.472]  I remember talking to the head of Media Bypass.
[01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:12.053]  I mean, these guys were like, we got to defeat them.
[01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:14.835]  You know, they're taking people's houses.
[01:26:14.855 --> 01:26:16.617]  I mean, these are like real people, folks.
[01:26:17.537 --> 01:26:28.986]  And it's got to feel good for all these old guys who were doing this in the 80s, back when talk radio was banned in the so-called free country, to have literally exposed everything.
[01:26:29.206 --> 01:26:30.707]  And they go on to say, what are they exposing?
[01:26:31.188 --> 01:26:31.988]  This is in Section 7.
[01:26:32.348 --> 01:26:32.669]  Look at this.
[01:26:34.181 --> 01:26:35.302]  The internet influence.
[01:26:35.322 --> 01:26:36.203]  This is what they want stopped.
[01:26:36.243 --> 01:26:38.666]  Number one, Watergate, Vince Foster homepage.
[01:26:40.147 --> 01:26:42.330]  Imagine back then there might have been a dozen websites fighting him.
[01:26:43.274 --> 01:26:49.596]  And then they influenced people like the young Drudge in 1993, who started his website in 94, 95, 96.
[01:26:50.836 --> 01:26:53.737]  First it was email, who then became the phenomenon.
[01:26:54.438 --> 01:26:56.698]  And then see, now we're influencing other people as well.
[01:26:57.319 --> 01:26:58.299]  And Drudge influenced me.
[01:26:58.739 --> 01:27:04.421]  I mean, I would go to a bunch of websites every day to look for news and stuff to cover on the radio, but I would go to Drudge, number one.
[01:27:05.862 --> 01:27:08.923]  And then that inspired me to have a website where I could post links.
[01:27:09.523 --> 01:27:17.004]  My site was first liked drugs because I wanted to post links so I could show listeners when I made a claim about a bill or photos I'd taken.
[01:27:18.604 --> 01:27:20.625]  Back then, mainstream media would just lie.
[01:27:20.825 --> 01:27:22.105]  They were mainstream media still then.
[01:27:22.585 --> 01:27:23.985]  And they would just say, there is no U.N.
[01:27:24.025 --> 01:27:24.745]  takeover of the parks.
[01:27:24.765 --> 01:27:26.026]  Well, I would post the executive order.
[01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:33.247]  I would go, you know, post photos of them threatening to arrest me for asking questions at the Grand Canyon.
[01:27:34.599 --> 01:27:42.061]  And then I spend the rest of my time trying to pay a $20,000 bandwidth bill because, you know, a half million people will visit my website in a month to look at those photos.
[01:27:46.622 --> 01:27:48.842]  I mean, I got into this when there was hardly anybody doing it.
[01:27:48.862 --> 01:27:50.362]  That's why I went through so much hell.
[01:27:51.303 --> 01:27:55.764]  The harassment, the cars following me, the audits, guys beating me up in parking lots.
[01:27:56.564 --> 01:28:01.265]  I mean, back in the day, folks, back in like 1996, I was kind of second wave.
[01:28:01.285 --> 01:28:02.165]  There was first wave.
[01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:03.991]  Second wave.
[01:28:04.011 --> 01:28:06.212]  I would say Drudge was the end of the first wave.
[01:28:06.753 --> 01:28:08.394]  I was the beginning of the second wave.
[01:28:08.674 --> 01:28:09.855]  We're now into fourth wave.
[01:28:09.875 --> 01:28:13.258]  There's been third wave by the mid-2000s.
[01:28:13.278 --> 01:28:14.759]  Now we're going to fourth wave.
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:16.161]  Fifth wave starting to start.
[01:28:16.521 --> 01:28:21.245]  And fifth wave is so big, the enemy is just absolutely crapping their pants right now.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:32.104]  What are you going to dispatch mercenaries to beat everybody up in the parking lot or threaten their families?
[01:28:32.884 --> 01:28:33.965]  There's too many of us now.
[01:28:34.806 --> 01:28:38.248]  You can't blow stuff up and blame us because you know our people are everywhere.
[01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:40.070]  Our people are everywhere.
[01:28:40.810 --> 01:28:44.613]  And they're symbiotic, they're independent, they're not directed by a central system.
[01:28:44.833 --> 01:28:45.634]  You can't track them.
[01:28:45.874 --> 01:28:47.015]  And they don't care if you track them.
[01:28:48.387 --> 01:28:54.154]  They're willing to lock and load and walk with their guns down at your guns pointed at them saying, go ahead and shoot us.
[01:28:55.035 --> 01:28:57.859]  And that courage freaks you out because other people see that courage.
[01:28:58.039 --> 01:29:00.322]  And if you would have killed them, it would have been Alamo Part 2.
[01:29:00.362 --> 01:29:01.403]  It would have been...
[01:29:02.597 --> 01:29:04.678]  Lexington Part 2, right there.
[01:29:05.418 --> 01:29:07.178]  And believe me, I didn't even want that to happen.
[01:29:07.658 --> 01:29:08.719]  I want to fix this peacefully.
[01:29:09.079 --> 01:29:27.504]  But if you want a war to start, if you chicken-net pieces of traitorous crap at the White House, and all of you think you had a problem with a few websites like Joseph Farah and Media Bypass 20 years ago, what do you think's going to happen when you try to crush us this time?
[01:29:28.595 --> 01:29:32.658]  You're going to legitimize us, you're going to lionize us, you're going to give us martyrdom.
[01:29:33.858 --> 01:29:35.019]  And again, I'm not looking for that.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.081]  I don't think I get 40 virgins or whatever it is.
[01:29:39.022 --> 01:29:41.644]  What I get is a free future for my family, and your family.
[01:29:41.844 --> 01:29:52.371]  And what I get is not letting bug-eyed, chicken-necked, cowardly, parasitic, criminal, degenerate, lying, anti-human trash run this planet.
[01:29:53.171 --> 01:29:55.052]  You people better get out of our way!
[01:29:55.293 --> 01:29:56.854]  Do you understand that, scum?
[01:29:58.345 --> 01:30:01.347]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.268 --> 01:30:05.070]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.033 --> 01:30:14.718]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda, they are manipulating our genetics.
[01:30:14.898 --> 01:30:23.204]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:30:23.504 --> 01:30:25.526]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[01:30:25.726 --> 01:30:39.611]  Pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.

[01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:13.152]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:31:13.192 --> 01:31:17.333]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:31:17.533 --> 01:31:20.954]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:31:21.215 --> 01:31:24.096]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:31:24.236 --> 01:31:31.618]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:35.460]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:39.981]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:31:40.142 --> 01:31:46.084]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:31:46.124 --> 01:31:49.885]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:31:50.065 --> 01:31:52.606]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:31:52.806 --> 01:31:54.146]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:31:54.306 --> 01:31:55.527]  It's time to take action.
[01:31:55.667 --> 01:31:57.367]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:33:11.758 --> 01:33:13.699]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:14.139 --> 01:33:14.619]  A lie!
[01:33:15.059 --> 01:33:16.759]  No man is obsolete!
[01:33:17.059 --> 01:33:18.860]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.821]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:33:22.161 --> 01:33:27.242]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:33:27.622 --> 01:33:29.303]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:29.323 --> 01:33:30.363]  A crawling insect!
[01:33:31.043 --> 01:33:34.865]  Ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:33:35.445 --> 01:33:36.586]  I am a human being!
[01:33:36.966 --> 01:33:44.209]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:46.890]  I don't care, I tell you, I don't care!
[01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:49.011]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[01:33:49.091 --> 01:33:53.233]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives!
[01:33:53.957 --> 01:33:56.018]  Even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:33:56.158 --> 01:33:58.880]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:06.724]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, but you have no strength at all!
[01:34:07.004 --> 01:34:12.407]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[01:34:14.088 --> 01:34:17.629]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:18.150 --> 01:34:19.871]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:30.151]  Now to show you how scared they are of us, we now have the White House memos.
[01:34:30.451 --> 01:34:32.572]  Joseph Farah's on the show Friday to talk about this.
[01:34:33.972 --> 01:34:36.753]  Where what was Clinton worried about in 1993-94?
[01:34:38.114 --> 01:34:40.135]  Whitewater Vince Foster homepage.
[01:34:40.155 --> 01:34:41.655]  Remember that site listing all the deaths?
[01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:45.437]  People with their arms and legs chopped off, shot nine times in the head.
[01:34:45.917 --> 01:34:47.537]  Fannie Malick would rule it a suicide.
[01:34:48.038 --> 01:34:49.058]  Clinton's medical examiner.
[01:34:49.078 --> 01:34:50.558]  Remember all that?
[01:34:50.598 --> 01:34:51.419]  The Clinton Chronicles?
[01:34:51.479 --> 01:34:51.799]  All of it.
[01:34:53.735 --> 01:35:00.158]  Oh, how to shut down communications on the net between Congressional Republicans and right-wing conspiracy theory proponents.
[01:35:01.718 --> 01:35:08.161]  And again, they talk about defining any criticism of any claims of corruption that doesn't exist, even though it all came out.
[01:35:08.902 --> 01:35:14.204]  New York Times article, Washington Post article, San Diego Union Tribune article, Washington Post article.
[01:35:14.464 --> 01:35:16.705]  This was them freaking out over just a few articles.
[01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:26.335]  Can you imagine now how they feel, knowing that the average MSNBC show has about 100,000 viewers, their top show is half a mil?
[01:35:28.796 --> 01:35:29.517]  Can you imagine?
[01:35:29.777 --> 01:35:34.700]  Now, what's going to happen here, though, is that they do have the stage terror card, and they will probably play it.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:37.462]  It's all they've got, even though we're going to expose them on that front.
[01:35:38.402 --> 01:35:43.326]  And I think because they are so exposed, it'll be incredibly heinous.
[01:35:43.746 --> 01:35:45.907]  I think Obama's thinking about nuke in New York City.
[01:35:45.967 --> 01:35:46.448]  I really do.
[01:35:47.546 --> 01:35:53.432]  And I've been telling you that for a long time, and now you said his number one fear is a nuke, he doesn't say who, blowing up Manhattan.
[01:35:56.014 --> 01:35:58.777]  And I think what the Bundy Ranch message sends them is this.
[01:36:00.639 --> 01:36:04.702]  The word's gone out that criminal elements hijacked the country and are staging terror attacks.
[01:36:05.563 --> 01:36:12.410]  And so even if you try to nuke New York to bring in total martial law, even if you unplug the internet and everything, it's not going to work.
[01:36:13.598 --> 01:36:20.123]  And I know you have a total bloodlust to go after bitter clingers, and Socialists and Communists are the foot soldiers of the foreign banks.
[01:36:21.304 --> 01:36:21.884]  The fascists.
[01:36:21.964 --> 01:36:39.577]  But they use Socialists and Communists as their foot soldiers, and they so hate freedom, and so want to put us in those weathermen camps, and so want to be able to just say, your kids belong to us, and totally take over once and for all, that they may do anything.
[01:36:39.917 --> 01:36:42.359]  That's why it's important to really dominate them up front.
[01:36:43.865 --> 01:36:51.997]  Because if you let one tyrant stand up, they might all stand up and stage a terror attack, and then there goes America, and then we'll have nuclear war, and there goes the planet.
[01:36:52.358 --> 01:36:56.784]  To turn a bug's life on its head, you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up.
[01:36:57.642 --> 01:36:58.883]  And then there goes our way of life.
[01:36:58.943 --> 01:37:01.524]  What about we keep letting the tyrants run all over us?
[01:37:01.884 --> 01:37:06.786]  They're going to get so megalomaniacal, they're going to jump the shark and bite off more than they can chew.
[01:37:07.406 --> 01:37:08.126]  It's not just with us.
[01:37:08.146 --> 01:37:09.287]  They're starting wars with Russia.
[01:37:09.847 --> 01:37:14.409]  China's starting wars with Japan, seizing their ships for ships Japan took in the 1930s.
[01:37:14.909 --> 01:37:21.352]  War is brewing because there's a global financial meltdown happening because of the derivatives and attacks on productivity.
[01:37:21.992 --> 01:37:23.594]  And overpopulation in some areas.
[01:37:24.315 --> 01:37:27.017]  I don't believe in the general theories of overpopulation and the way they're deployed.
[01:37:27.218 --> 01:37:28.919]  There is overpopulation in many areas.
[01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:35.466]  And there's cultures that don't have missions and are just living in absolute squalor and hell.
[01:37:36.608 --> 01:37:42.073]  And the globalists are usually aiding and abetting that, as the British Commission on Population stated in 1949.
[01:37:42.193 --> 01:37:44.396]  I mean, they admitted that.
[01:37:45.765 --> 01:37:49.127]  Because they don't want to give Promethean fire to the third world and build them up.
[01:37:49.467 --> 01:37:53.029]  You industrialize, you quit having even enough kids to replace yourself.
[01:37:54.349 --> 01:37:57.391]  You get a 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 replacement rate.
[01:37:57.411 --> 01:38:00.112]  You need 2.1, as everybody knows, to even hold the society up.
[01:38:00.492 --> 01:38:12.318]  So they've figured out a collapse algorithm where they see the collapse before it happens and they orchestrate it before the flashpoints come that cause a collapse that they're not steering.
[01:38:12.899 --> 01:38:13.559]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:38:14.864 --> 01:38:26.795]  And then in that collapse, they plan to target the best members of the human civilization, because we're seen as alpha leaders who challenge them in their override of humanity.
[01:38:26.815 --> 01:38:28.116]  And that's, again, their ultimate sin.
[01:38:28.377 --> 01:38:31.059]  I keep restating, that is a sin against humanity.
[01:38:31.539 --> 01:38:34.382]  Even if you believe in God, that is a sin against the species.
[01:38:34.822 --> 01:38:38.426]  It is eugenics inverted.
[01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:40.388]  Not even targeting of the weak.
[01:38:41.647 --> 01:38:42.768]  Is the targeting of the strong.
[01:38:43.288 --> 01:38:44.890]  But eugenics was always about that.
[01:38:45.650 --> 01:38:50.414]  That's outer eugenics is the targeting of the weak and the mentally ill.
[01:38:52.076 --> 01:39:03.004]  But it's authored by inbred globalists who were obsessed with genes because they were so inbred most of their children were absolute nightmares or were born dead.
[01:39:03.325 --> 01:39:07.308]  So the elite put all their money into finding what made humans operate
[01:39:11.383 --> 01:39:11.943]  It's incredible.
[01:39:12.103 --> 01:39:13.384]  I mean, they are master builders.
[01:39:13.784 --> 01:39:15.185]  They are incredible engineers.
[01:39:15.245 --> 01:39:15.906]  They are smart.
[01:39:15.946 --> 01:39:16.666]  I mean, I'll give it to them.
[01:39:17.506 --> 01:39:27.052]  But the thing is, they've got this twist of cane in them that makes them so wicked that anything they build ends up being predatory and just destroying everything in its path.
[01:39:29.093 --> 01:39:33.435]  Collectively, the globalists are in artificial intelligence already.
[01:39:33.896 --> 01:39:35.477]  And let me announce to you here now
[01:39:36.906 --> 01:39:37.206]  I don't
[01:39:54.981 --> 01:40:12.790]  Minnesota multi-phasic system squared to infinity, algorithmed and sent into the giant mainframe grids to predict the future and then be able to steer the future with artificial stimuli brought in from the outside.
[01:40:12.850 --> 01:40:14.271]  And I've told you this for 10 years.
[01:40:14.751 --> 01:40:15.852]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:40:18.413 --> 01:40:20.334]  And this artificial intelligence
[01:40:22.057 --> 01:40:23.139]  is piloted.
[01:40:23.159 --> 01:40:24.401]  You can say, is it conscious?
[01:40:24.962 --> 01:40:25.643]  Is it sentient?
[01:40:25.884 --> 01:40:34.538]  I would say it is, because it's animated by the ghost in the machine that is human will and intellect and choices and desires flowing through it.
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:36.361]  Okay?
[01:40:38.618 --> 01:40:50.385]  But then you've got almost possession of the artificial system by the technocrats at the top, those that control the keys to the NSA and the Microsoft and Google grids.
[01:40:50.906 --> 01:40:56.349]  And what the elite did was decide to carve it up so that one person didn't have all the rings of Mordor.
[01:40:56.749 --> 01:41:03.934]  And so keys, or rings, were given to Microsoft, given to Apple, given to Google, given to the NSA.
[01:41:04.294 --> 01:41:05.655]  The Pentagon wants keys.
[01:41:05.955 --> 01:41:07.276]  That's what cybersecurity is.
[01:41:07.836 --> 01:41:08.876]  They're all battling.
[01:41:08.916 --> 01:41:10.297]  The Chinese were given keys.
[01:41:10.857 --> 01:41:12.118]  The Brits were given keys.
[01:41:12.558 --> 01:41:13.918]  NATO was given keys.
[01:41:14.418 --> 01:41:17.179]  Interpol, to a certain extent, was given keys or rings.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:19.940]  They were given rings of power, to use that analogy.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.181]  That's actually how the globalists describe it.
[01:41:22.481 --> 01:41:27.223]  I said it's like a palantir or a ring, and now we get the secret NSA documents, that's what they call them.
[01:41:27.603 --> 01:41:29.845]  I mean, I just know their mind.
[01:41:30.065 --> 01:41:35.570]  Because I have an organic system as well that's able to gather the data and understand how humans operate.
[01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:38.913]  So I know how humans are manifesting because I know man.
[01:41:39.213 --> 01:41:42.296]  I know how they're manifesting in the artificial intelligence.
[01:41:43.757 --> 01:41:44.378]  You understand that?
[01:41:45.558 --> 01:41:50.101]  The artificial intelligence, there it is, seven people have been entrusted with the keys to the internet.
[01:41:50.342 --> 01:41:51.422]  I didn't even know that was in the news.
[01:41:51.883 --> 01:41:55.486]  I already know most of the time what's in the news before it's in the news.
[01:41:55.906 --> 01:41:58.728]  Because I know the mind of this system.
[01:41:59.208 --> 01:42:00.950]  Because I live it and I study it.
[01:42:02.691 --> 01:42:05.313]  And you can see it all being built around you.
[01:42:05.693 --> 01:42:14.100]  So remember, from the beginning, they wanted to keep libertarian or traditionalist or conservative ideas out, or anyone just exposing, man, a lot of people are getting murdered.
[01:42:15.384 --> 01:42:16.845]  A lot of people are dying, Vince Foster.
[01:42:17.486 --> 01:42:19.748]  This shows these are just people we're facing.
[01:42:19.968 --> 01:42:21.329]  And they'll always be people.
[01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:25.352]  They claim they're going to dial into the internet.
[01:42:25.692 --> 01:42:28.334]  They claim they're going to be sentient and tied into everything.
[01:42:28.755 --> 01:42:33.659]  And then they openly say in all their writings that those of us that don't join the collective will be eliminated.
[01:42:35.507 --> 01:42:38.389]  That's a 1970s Pentagon document that was reclassified.
[01:42:38.409 --> 01:42:41.532]  It was declassified in 2001, reclassified.
[01:42:41.552 --> 01:42:46.876]  The Federation of American Scientists released it, and then it was reclassified.
[01:42:46.916 --> 01:42:49.579]  But the Pentagon said full spectrum dominance.
[01:42:50.583 --> 01:43:05.340]  Is the evolution of television, smart computers, smart glasses, smart contacts, the first ports that will be status symbols, brain implants, and then moving completely into humans that will live a time in tanks.
[01:43:06.081 --> 01:43:18.972]  For their safety, in an embryonic dream state, basically, into the neural hive, they call it a hive, and then finally you will transcend your body and the biological side of you will be removed.
[01:43:19.352 --> 01:43:23.896]  And if you don't accept that, you will be just stepped on like a bug, to quote Ray Kurzweil.
[01:43:24.116 --> 01:43:26.218]  And you're going, Alex, I've heard of this before.
[01:43:27.098 --> 01:43:28.219]  It's called the Matrix, yes.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.383]  The Wachowski brothers got what they put in that movie from a lot of sources, but it came
[01:43:34.284 --> 01:43:39.006]  Ladies and gentlemen, from the Pentagon and DARPA.
[01:43:39.326 --> 01:43:42.327]  The internet came from DARPA and the Pentagon.
[01:43:42.567 --> 01:43:48.450]  This is a master decision that has been made to end you and your family as you know it.
[01:43:48.810 --> 01:43:52.111]  The megachurches have all brought the Xboxes and smartphones in for the kids.
[01:43:52.431 --> 01:43:54.292]  They're telling the women divorce their husbands.
[01:43:54.912 --> 01:43:59.194]  I mean, you are just going to see the total manifestation of evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:10.932]  You're going to see the will of the horrible people like Ezekiel Emanuel and Bill Gates and Bill Clinton and George Soros and the Queen of England.
[01:44:11.352 --> 01:44:14.713]  You're going to see these people given this incredible power.
[01:44:14.733 --> 01:44:19.514]  I'm here to tell you the singularity is going to happen in stages.
[01:44:20.885 --> 01:44:31.927]  But the singularity for humans dialing in, for the elite to be able to predict general future trends with 100% algorithm, is now happening.
[01:44:31.987 --> 01:44:43.710]  The problem in the algorithm is alternative, independent media exposing criminal operations, because if you revert to your original human programming against corruption,
[01:44:45.970 --> 01:44:51.232]  And if you click back into that mode and not their new programming, they can't predict the future.
[01:44:51.492 --> 01:44:56.873]  They can only predict the future because they're feeding you the stimuli to be able to predict the future.
[01:44:57.994 --> 01:45:02.135]  That's how Amazon can begin to ship your package before you go to the website and order it.
[01:45:02.395 --> 01:45:04.196]  They know what you're going to order with their algorithms.
[01:45:04.456 --> 01:45:07.057]  But that's only because they've been tracking you for 10 years.
[01:45:08.396 --> 01:45:12.039]  When you break with them, now you are reborn.
[01:45:12.159 --> 01:45:13.360]  And this is not even religious.
[01:45:13.801 --> 01:45:16.303]  This is a program-level algorithm.
[01:45:17.123 --> 01:45:21.026]  You have an ancient algorithm unknown in its true providence.
[01:45:21.447 --> 01:45:24.469]  The eye has not seen, ear has not heard God's real operation.
[01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:28.413]  They put out fake men to stunt and de-science
[01:45:28.993 --> 01:45:40.217]  The ancient teachings show that you will not go back to the basic common sense of what the earth really is, so you will accept these new demigods as your gods.
[01:45:40.558 --> 01:45:48.601]  What type of god says we're crap when we were able to build this and plans to kill us when we manifest it as a god?
[01:45:50.402 --> 01:45:52.482]  Ray Kurzweil said, I don't believe in God yet.
[01:45:52.742 --> 01:45:54.423]  I went and saw Transcendence last night.
[01:45:54.903 --> 01:45:56.244]  An incredibly wicked movie.
[01:45:56.994 --> 01:46:08.456]  Where he is Johnny Depp, the scientist, the computer is God, manifest, and it brings the general public back to the Stone Age.
[01:46:09.824 --> 01:46:13.248]  The singularity destroys technology except for itself.
[01:46:14.048 --> 01:46:20.355]  And now it is a biotech in the Earth's genetic code to save it.
[01:46:20.815 --> 01:46:28.003]  Well, let me tell you, everything that the system's bringing out rewrites the genetic code and ends the planet as we know it.
[01:46:30.902 --> 01:46:32.705]  So, this is what they're doing.
[01:46:33.206 --> 01:46:35.930]  And their religion is in your face that they're God.
[01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:39.916]  Folks, do you think Rachel Maddow or Janet Reno is your God?
[01:46:44.522 --> 01:46:47.825]  The Creator made us, and we were able to create this.
[01:46:48.466 --> 01:47:00.837]  These people have hijacked the Promethean fire that God gave us, and then they tell us they're God, when the spark of God, little g, was given to us in the image.
[01:47:02.751 --> 01:47:15.101]  And then everything they do is to attack the image and to attack the creation because it looks like and acts like it has the stamp and the smaller algorithm of the greater creator.
[01:47:15.301 --> 01:47:18.844]  The truth is we are the nanotech of God.
[01:47:19.264 --> 01:47:23.467]  We, the life on this planet, are the finger of God.
[01:47:23.928 --> 01:47:28.912]  And the enemy has hacked us and is using our power to create.
[01:47:30.421 --> 01:47:34.362]  To then create abominations on the face of the earth.
[01:47:39.063 --> 01:47:43.685]  I mean, are you going to be ruled by that narcissistic, stunted, small technician of evil?
[01:47:46.846 --> 01:47:53.787]  Rachel Maddow, the people on MSNBC saying, quote, I'm a terrorist connected to the Boston bombing who's deeply racist.
[01:47:54.168 --> 01:47:56.088]  My lawyer said, oh, you'll definitely want a lawsuit against them.
[01:47:56.328 --> 01:47:57.128]  It'll take two years.
[01:47:57.729 --> 01:47:58.249]  You want to do that?
[01:47:58.789 --> 01:47:58.869]  No.
[01:47:59.870 --> 01:48:01.176]  Everyone knows they're discredited.
[01:48:01.497 --> 01:48:03.204]  Everyone has voted organically.
[01:48:04.295 --> 01:48:05.516]  That they don't want to watch them.
[01:48:05.616 --> 01:48:08.117]  We don't want your Godhead.
[01:48:08.637 --> 01:48:10.418]  We don't want your manifestation.
[01:48:10.699 --> 01:48:12.059]  We don't think you're God.
[01:48:12.399 --> 01:48:14.260]  We don't want to follow you.
[01:48:14.561 --> 01:48:16.202]  We don't want to worship you.
[01:48:16.462 --> 01:48:17.662]  We are fulfilled.
[01:48:17.943 --> 01:48:21.404]  We are, our destiny is there for us.
[01:48:21.545 --> 01:48:23.626]  You are not our destiny.
[01:48:23.886 --> 01:48:25.567]  You are an abomination.
[01:48:25.807 --> 01:48:26.647]  You are death.
[01:48:26.907 --> 01:48:27.528]  You stink.
[01:48:27.788 --> 01:48:28.488]  You're ugly.
[01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:29.689]  You smell.
[01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:31.230]  Literally.
[01:48:32.483 --> 01:48:33.344]  Do you understand that?
[01:48:33.625 --> 01:48:34.646]  You are a failure!
[01:48:34.866 --> 01:48:36.449]  It's why you want to butcher us!
[01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:38.251]  It's why you hate us!
[01:48:40.775 --> 01:48:42.057]  Do you understand that?
[01:48:42.197 --> 01:48:42.617]  Scum!
[01:48:42.758 --> 01:48:43.579]  Stand down!
[01:48:43.699 --> 01:48:44.720]  Get behind us!
[01:48:45.121 --> 01:48:45.942]  MSNBC!
[01:48:46.062 --> 01:48:46.583]  White House!
[01:48:46.703 --> 01:48:48.185]  Get behind me, Satan!
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:50.200]  Get behind me.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:51.741]  I do not want to be part of your works.
[01:48:52.121 --> 01:49:02.645]  I am a free, sentient being in the universe, and under universal law, I declare my freedom, I declare that I will have justice, and I declare I am not your slave.
[01:49:02.925 --> 01:49:03.525]  You got that?
[01:49:04.386 --> 01:49:05.186]  You understand that?
[01:49:05.486 --> 01:49:06.326]  I think you do.
[01:49:06.426 --> 01:49:07.547]  You don't like that, do you?
[01:49:08.732 --> 01:49:10.513]  Now get out of humanity's way.
[01:49:11.114 --> 01:49:23.382]  If you guys think you can get your own resources that weren't stolen and go off to some asteroid and build the hellish world you want to build, you go there and feed off each other and be greedy and hateful and scum and pose that you're the good guys all day.
[01:49:23.782 --> 01:49:26.564]  We don't want to be around you.
[01:49:27.364 --> 01:49:31.027]  Our children are ours and they belong to the thousand generations before us.
[01:49:31.387 --> 01:49:33.028]  They do not belong to you!
[01:49:33.448 --> 01:49:38.432]  You belong to your generations of evil, failed, scum, guaranteed!
[01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:43.176]  You go be with your people, we'll be with ours.
[01:49:43.436 --> 01:49:44.057]  How's that sound?
[01:49:44.517 --> 01:49:54.906]  And people whose genetics resonate with us, old, young, black, white, north, south, east, west, they will be called to the true light.
[01:49:55.686 --> 01:50:01.571]  You will be called to your inferno that you flap around like blind moths.
[01:50:03.012 --> 01:50:06.836]  So, you've got your God, we've got our God.
[01:50:08.115 --> 01:50:16.540]  Our God is the God that has justice, and that has families, and that has honor and truth, and we can see the fruits of your God.
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.121]  Your God creates World War III.
[01:50:19.942 --> 01:50:21.402]  Your God creates Al Qaeda.
[01:50:22.043 --> 01:50:25.485]  Your God creates death and destruction and abortion and fraud.
[01:50:25.825 --> 01:50:36.431]  Your God creates giant ghettos of dependent, soulless people, grown up in front of television their whole lives, acting like thugs, with giant prisons and record cancer rates.
[01:50:37.071 --> 01:50:38.832]  We don't like where you take us.
[01:50:39.273 --> 01:50:40.794]  We don't like the way you taste.
[01:50:41.234 --> 01:50:43.356]  And you force-fed us a lot of your evil.
[01:50:43.576 --> 01:50:47.238]  We're now going to stick our fingers down our throats and vomit you out of us.
[01:50:47.659 --> 01:50:49.340]  We're now going to exorcise you.
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:53.903]  We're now going to perform a global exorcism and kick your asses off the planet.
[01:50:54.203 --> 01:50:55.084]  How does that sound?
[01:50:55.664 --> 01:50:56.405]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:56.425 --> 01:50:58.146]  I'm going to give the number out and take calls in the third hour.
[01:50:58.186 --> 01:50:59.207]  I'm a little bit preachy today.
[01:50:59.227 --> 01:51:00.488]  We're going to come back with your calls.
[01:51:00.528 --> 01:51:02.990]  David Knight's coming up with some breaking news as well.
[01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:04.751]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:09.961]  Attention gun owners.
[01:51:10.221 --> 01:51:14.903]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[01:51:15.023 --> 01:51:18.485]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[01:51:18.725 --> 01:51:20.867]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.
[01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:23.268]  Is civilian legal in all 50 states?

[01:53:07.981 --> 01:53:08.381]  Hi there.
[01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:10.062]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:53:10.523 --> 01:53:13.725]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:53:14.325 --> 01:53:23.131]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:53:23.491 --> 01:53:29.515]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:53:30.196 --> 01:53:31.777]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:53:32.377 --> 01:53:37.481]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:53:38.181 --> 01:53:45.286]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:53:46.147 --> 01:53:51.030]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:53:51.711 --> 01:53:57.615]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:53:58.195 --> 01:54:03.539]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:54:03.939 --> 01:54:05.200]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:54:36.937 --> 01:54:41.601]  So, we have the Clinton Library in 1993.
[01:54:42.081 --> 01:54:52.089]  The documents, the ones they released, they redacted over 90%, saying we want to shut down new media.
[01:54:52.910 --> 01:55:00.816]  We don't want the public, you can go read the 30 pages or so, where they say we don't want the public having access, we only want controlled media.
[01:55:01.917 --> 01:55:04.019]  This could really, you know, cause us big problems.
[01:55:05.219 --> 01:55:06.340]  That's who these people are.
[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:09.723]  Anytime the globalists get control of a country, they put a dictatorship in if they can.
[01:55:10.403 --> 01:55:17.328]  And that's what Homeland Security is, is the incremental dictatorship, the politically correct dictatorship over America, and everyone's starting to see that.
[01:55:18.009 --> 01:55:24.634]  And this could really boomerang on the establishment, and we could have a renaissance, a restoration in this country, and then worldwide.
[01:55:25.595 --> 01:55:26.435]  You notice the U.S.
[01:55:26.456 --> 01:55:33.341]  doesn't even criticize Chinese abuses anymore of their political class, of their general public, because they support it.
[01:55:35.635 --> 01:55:36.936]  We have become the bad guys.
[01:55:37.096 --> 01:55:38.556]  We have bad people running things.
[01:55:39.037 --> 01:55:40.137]  We have to say no.
[01:55:41.598 --> 01:55:44.379]  And now, there's so many other media outlets in the world.
[01:55:44.559 --> 01:55:45.840]  English is the world language.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:47.761]  They talk about this in the document as well.
[01:55:49.081 --> 01:55:53.663]  And so, if our stuff doesn't get published here or doesn't get picked up here, it gets picked up around the world.
[01:55:54.144 --> 01:55:57.665]  And see, most media only cares about their market, who they target.
[01:55:58.065 --> 01:55:59.866]  I get asked all the time by consultants and people,
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:04.141]  Well, how do you target your demographic?
[01:56:04.662 --> 01:56:05.762]  I don't target anything.
[01:56:06.102 --> 01:56:18.770]  I tell you what I think, what I've researched, and I want to reach Russians and Chinese and Africans and Brazilians and Mexicans and South Islanders and Germans and Israelis and Syrians.
[01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:20.811]  I want to reach all of them.
[01:56:22.212 --> 01:56:25.494]  I get a thrill when I get a call from Syria or a call from Israel.
[01:56:26.975 --> 01:56:29.096]  I get a thrill when I get a call from Germany or Australia.
[01:56:29.596 --> 01:56:30.737]  I want to reach people.
[01:56:31.909 --> 01:56:33.070]  I want to empower people.
[01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:40.733]  I want to stop the thugs and the bullies and the cartels that are tax-exempt while raising taxes so high it's making it hard to live worldwide.
[01:56:42.734 --> 01:56:43.735]  I take it personal.
[01:56:47.377 --> 01:56:48.797]  And we need to start taking it personal.
[01:56:48.977 --> 01:56:53.440]  But it shows how scared they are, A, and B, what authoritarians they are.
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:55.281]  And then you understand when you watch MSNBC now.
[01:56:57.401 --> 01:57:05.787]  When they're up there saying the Drudge Report picks up Infowars and it's terrible and it's connected to violence and terrorism and these people are radicals and what are we going to do?
[01:57:06.007 --> 01:57:16.914]  That's a dying operation literally that just keeps the lights on as a propaganda operation losing money to make it look like they still have moral authority trying to boss everyone around.
[01:57:17.194 --> 01:57:22.738]  But as soon as the Libertarians figure out and the Constitutionalists that they've got the power, it's game over.
[01:57:25.796 --> 01:57:27.717]  Now I've done almost two hours of transmission.
[01:57:27.737 --> 01:57:35.860]  I'm going to give the number out for wide open phones, your take on this issue and what these documents mean and where the attack on free speech is going and how we beat these people.
[01:57:36.161 --> 01:57:37.401]  I want to hear from you in the next hour.
[01:57:37.421 --> 01:57:37.461]  800-259-9231.
[01:57:37.481 --> 01:57:37.521]  800-259-9231.
[01:57:37.561 --> 01:57:37.721]  Briefly.
[01:57:46.055 --> 01:57:46.996]  We need your support.
[01:57:47.056 --> 01:57:49.197]  We don't get taxpayer money like MSNBC.
[01:57:49.237 --> 01:57:49.878]  I say that every day.
[01:57:50.098 --> 01:57:50.979]  They get stimulus money.
[01:57:51.199 --> 01:57:53.180]  We don't get Warren Buffett money like ABC News.
[01:57:53.901 --> 01:57:54.842]  We get funded by you.
[01:57:54.962 --> 01:58:02.988]  High quality supplements, high quality Made in America apparel, high quality books, videos, materials, you name it.
[01:58:03.268 --> 01:58:05.570]  Water filters, the best prices, the best units.
[01:58:06.271 --> 01:58:07.491]  And how do we successfully do it?
[01:58:07.752 --> 01:58:10.254]  We also have really high quality products, so you keep coming back.
[01:58:11.127 --> 01:58:12.590]  We sell you stuff we'd want.
[01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:16.196]  Everything I carry or watch, you know, all the stuff is stuff I like.
[01:58:16.597 --> 01:58:18.841]  Stuff I've... Stuff I use.
[01:58:18.881 --> 01:58:19.503]  Stuff I'm into.
[01:58:19.523 --> 01:58:21.927]  I treat people like I want to be treated.
[01:58:21.967 --> 01:58:22.809]  It's real old-fashioned.
[01:58:24.537 --> 01:58:25.618]  I wouldn't treat somebody bad.
[01:58:26.378 --> 01:58:26.898]  Even my enemy.
[01:58:26.959 --> 01:58:27.779]  I just want to stay away from them.
[01:58:28.379 --> 01:58:30.481]  The point is, buy our products.
[01:58:30.581 --> 01:58:37.205]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:37.445 --> 01:58:40.907]  Call, ask any questions about specials.
[01:58:40.927 --> 01:58:41.247]  888-253-3139.
[01:58:41.548 --> 01:58:47.271]  Or, Infowarslife.com to find our proprietary, one-of-a-kind products.
[01:58:47.571 --> 01:58:48.272]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:49.113 --> 01:58:49.734]  Third hour!
[01:58:49.874 --> 01:58:51.076]  Rampaging forward!
[01:58:51.737 --> 01:58:53.620]  We don't use maneuvers here.
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:54.381]  We're straight up.
[01:58:54.441 --> 01:58:55.022]  We shoot you straight!
[01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:07.938]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:59:08.018 --> 01:59:16.264]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:59:16.425 --> 01:59:21.128]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:59:21.308 --> 01:59:24.691]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:59:26.172 --> 01:59:26.752]  We're good to go.
[01:59:50.157 --> 01:59:56.282]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:59:56.442 --> 01:59:58.143]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:00:01.986 --> 02:00:03.908]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.368 --> 02:00:07.171]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:13.888 --> 02:00:14.509]  Big Brother.
[02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:16.210]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:16.951 --> 02:00:18.052]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:18.713 --> 02:00:19.514]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.295 --> 02:00:21.196]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.836 --> 02:00:25.460]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.041 --> 02:00:30.105]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:49.398 --> 02:00:51.058]  Alright folks, here's what's coming up.
[02:00:51.118 --> 02:00:59.140]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, as many of them as I can, and then we've got a 16-minute report that Jakari Jackson did.
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:05.041]  We're going to have David Knight come in real quick and tell you some Bundy developments at the bottom of the next hour.
[02:01:05.061 --> 02:01:11.663]  And he'll have about three minutes to do that, then we'll air this Jakari Jackson report.
[02:01:14.741 --> 02:01:24.129]  Then we will come back in the last segment with more from David Knight, giving you some more Bundy updates.
[02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:36.799]  There's a video I haven't gotten to yet that was on KXAN two days ago, and Don Salazar wrote about it, but it didn't break nationally, that shows a Georgetown cop in Williamson County, north of Austin, where the religion is the police or God.
[02:01:37.734 --> 02:01:42.756]  Tripping and punching kids for no reason for fun at a high school.
[02:01:43.476 --> 02:01:46.857]  A pot-bellied cop beating kids up and tripping them for fun.
[02:01:47.538 --> 02:01:49.719]  And of course, Williamson County is defending it right now.
[02:01:50.839 --> 02:01:51.699]  That is the sacrament.
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:57.121]  The sacrament is the power for them to do whatever they want and to exercise the raw, naked power.
[02:01:57.762 --> 02:02:00.362]  So he'll be promoted to probably police chief next.
[02:02:01.503 --> 02:02:06.585]  But you had the players jumping up and down and some other folks and the cop is
[02:02:08.237 --> 02:02:09.337]  Is tripping people.
[02:02:10.458 --> 02:02:13.378]  Imagine being in that school, if you do anything wrong, what the cop does to you.
[02:02:13.398 --> 02:02:17.159]  Of course, we have South America, I think it's Brazil, in another video.
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:18.720]  Oh, they're attacking a girl?
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:19.220]  Good!
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:20.000]  That's a real man.
[02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:23.461]  Just any excuse to attack your children.
[02:02:23.961 --> 02:02:26.182]  And if their head hits the concrete and they die, so what?
[02:02:27.162 --> 02:02:28.742]  We'll just send a SWAT team to the parent's house.
[02:02:30.063 --> 02:02:31.623]  So, that's all coming up.
[02:02:31.943 --> 02:02:34.444]  Caught on tape, cop shoves, trips high school soccer fans.
[02:02:36.937 --> 02:02:40.959]  And then below it, we have what happens in South America when the cops attack people on the field.
[02:02:40.979 --> 02:02:41.840]  They get their butt kicked.
[02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:43.541]  Of course, they've not been drinking the fluoride.
[02:02:43.901 --> 02:02:48.283]  Though they've been fluoridating in South America and many countries for a few years now, suddenly fertility is dropping.
[02:02:50.164 --> 02:02:54.166]  Of course, LaRosa's not going to, or Metsch is not going to tell you about that, though.
[02:02:54.346 --> 02:02:57.628]  They'll tell you how to hate white people, because that's their main mission by the Ford Foundation.
[02:02:57.648 --> 02:02:58.268]  They want division.
[02:02:59.429 --> 02:03:01.490]  Karen in Arizona, you'll be our first caller.
[02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:02.571]  Thank you for calling in.
[02:03:02.591 --> 02:03:02.951]  Go ahead.
[02:03:03.652 --> 02:03:08.095]  Yes, I would like to tell you about a bill that was defeated by two votes.
[02:03:09.336 --> 02:03:15.600]  It's House Bill 2700, Federal Acquisition State Lands Monitoring.
[02:03:16.201 --> 02:03:31.271]  And then this bill, it would have said, monitor federal activity for proposals to sell or transfer federal land to private group or individual or to designate national monuments in the state.
[02:03:31.917 --> 02:03:38.059]  Notify the Attorney General when state lands or private lands are acquired by the federal government.
[02:03:38.879 --> 02:03:52.584]  Also inform the Governor, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, Representatives, Chairpersons of the Senate, Natural Resources, Rural Affairs Committee, House Representatives, Energy, etc.
[02:03:52.964 --> 02:03:59.606]  And this was defeated by two votes and three of our RINO Republicans voted against this bill.
[02:04:00.256 --> 02:04:02.337]  Yes, because they all want to get a piece of it.
[02:04:02.857 --> 02:04:10.441]  Again, more than half the West is, quote, controlled by the Feds, and now they're trying to grab land in Texas as well, and other areas.
[02:04:11.141 --> 02:04:16.164]  They're claiming all the waterway areas are going to, quote, be historic now, or strategic, and they're going to grab those.
[02:04:16.664 --> 02:04:20.846]  That's why they're deploying Homeland Security gunboats all over rivers everywhere to menace the public.
[02:04:22.247 --> 02:04:23.568]  So the storm troopers are everywhere.
[02:04:23.588 --> 02:04:27.051]  And it is a resource power grab, taxation power grab.
[02:04:27.691 --> 02:04:31.093]  There's a lot of state moves, too, to try to go after federal land.
[02:04:31.754 --> 02:04:33.295]  And it's an idea whose time has come.
[02:04:34.796 --> 02:04:36.157]  And it's the American system.
[02:04:36.778 --> 02:04:40.901]  That's why you've got about 5 to 10 percent of the land being federal in most eastern states.
[02:04:41.881 --> 02:04:45.944]  And in the Midwest, you go out to the West, it's over half federal.
[02:04:46.545 --> 02:04:49.527]  It's right at 90 percent now in Nevada.
[02:04:50.646 --> 02:04:51.487]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:04:51.847 --> 02:04:55.050]  We should get that bill passed and look at the rhinos that shot it down.
[02:04:55.070 --> 02:04:56.912]  You want to get America moving again?
[02:04:59.274 --> 02:05:04.119]  Turn over to the state, large portions of the West, and divvy it up.
[02:05:04.779 --> 02:05:05.900]  They're already mining on it.
[02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:06.641]  It's just globalists.
[02:05:06.661 --> 02:05:07.522]  The only ones that get to come do it.
[02:05:09.417 --> 02:05:16.583]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:05:16.683 --> 02:05:18.864]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:05:19.044 --> 02:05:24.248]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:05:24.409 --> 02:05:29.512]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:05:29.653 --> 02:05:32.735]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:05:33.015 --> 02:05:36.938]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:05:37.158 --> 02:05:41.461]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:05:41.541 --> 02:05:51.728]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:05:51.908 --> 02:05:56.271]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[02:05:56.391 --> 02:06:02.835]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:06:02.995 --> 02:06:08.400]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:17.507]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[02:06:17.767 --> 02:06:19.729]  All the major networks are state-run.
[02:06:19.989 --> 02:06:22.611]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[02:06:22.691 --> 02:06:27.095]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[02:06:27.115 --> 02:06:30.257]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[02:06:30.277 --> 02:06:37.563]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:06:37.763 --> 02:06:41.886]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[02:06:42.066 --> 02:06:43.768]  We are the true media.
[02:06:43.868 --> 02:06:46.470]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[02:06:46.530 --> 02:06:50.172]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[02:07:09.494 --> 02:07:12.396]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:12.536 --> 02:07:14.477]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[02:07:14.697 --> 02:07:20.681]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[02:07:20.882 --> 02:07:25.885]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[02:07:25.965 --> 02:07:30.668]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[02:07:30.828 --> 02:07:35.372]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[02:07:35.652 --> 02:07:44.040]  The Infowars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:46.202]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[02:07:46.402 --> 02:07:49.325]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers
[02:07:49.465 --> 02:07:49.805]  We're good to go.
[02:08:21.573 --> 02:08:25.242]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:08:25.743 --> 02:08:27.167]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:38.886 --> 02:08:42.409]  I warned of this in my first documentary film that came out in 1997.
[02:08:43.911 --> 02:08:49.636]  People wouldn't believe me that the UN was taking over about half the land in the country, all the public land, under treaty.
[02:08:50.157 --> 02:08:55.802]  I showed the executive order, I had members of Congress on, documenting that indeed it did do that.
[02:08:56.503 --> 02:09:01.267]  But they really warned about the waterways movements that were being pushed by Clinton at the time.
[02:09:02.088 --> 02:09:15.298]  That were later brought in under executive order under Bush and Obama to say that any waterway, including a pond in your backyard, is arrestable offense if you build anything on it or have crops on it.
[02:09:15.778 --> 02:09:25.546]  And you know the cases, they're all over the news, where somebody has one inch of water in their backyard or on their farm and they build something and they get arrested.
[02:09:25.946 --> 02:09:28.068]  And the news goes, that's good, we need to arrest everyone.
[02:09:29.224 --> 02:09:37.566]  I mean, this is the new Green Police idea, but the rivers themselves are under these different waterway acts being grabbed up.
[02:09:38.126 --> 02:09:44.668]  And the BLM's just coming in and saying, this was state right-of-way, but in an executive order, this has been designated as federal.
[02:09:45.708 --> 02:09:52.070]  And they'll even come in to local sheriffs and people and say, we'll give you federal grants if you petition the state to ask for this.
[02:09:52.130 --> 02:09:53.631]  So they'll act like everyone wants it.
[02:09:54.271 --> 02:09:58.872]  And then pretty soon, you get to have federal goons at the boat ramp in Tennessee.
[02:10:00.413 --> 02:10:01.094]  Or in Texas.
[02:10:02.395 --> 02:10:05.738]  And I've been running into them, folks, because I hunt and fish, and it is not fun.
[02:10:05.758 --> 02:10:08.760]  I mean, they walk over hand on gun and just stare at you.
[02:10:09.561 --> 02:10:12.223]  You're just like, are you mentally ill?
[02:10:12.303 --> 02:10:13.544]  I mean, seriously.
[02:10:14.325 --> 02:10:17.928]  But they want you to know you're not supposed to be here scum.
[02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:26.543]  I told the story back in the, I'm going to go to your phone calls, back in the fall, I guess it was, before it got too cold.
[02:10:26.623 --> 02:10:32.167]  I took my children out, my buddy Shane Steiner on his boat on Lake Austin, and they were wakeboarding.
[02:10:32.827 --> 02:10:39.271]  His nephews, the national champion for 11-year-olds in wakeboarding, or is it 10?
[02:10:39.351 --> 02:10:39.951]  Rocker Steiner.
[02:10:39.971 --> 02:10:46.915]  The point is, we're all out there having an absolutely great time, and there's only about 10 boats out there, and I watch
[02:10:48.086 --> 02:10:55.234]  The Lake Police, that I guess are with LCRA, driving around bugging their eyes out at people's boats with them pulled over, or kayaks.
[02:10:55.254 --> 02:11:00.860]  So they pull up behind us, and are sitting there bugging their eyes out with their chest out, literally like a cartoon character.
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:08.648]  So I did it, and Shane starts laughing and got his iPhone ready, and I stood there sticking my chest out, and then they started laughing and drove past me.
[02:11:10.267 --> 02:11:24.254]  I mean, I cannot imagine as a man with guns, driving up, going... But it's like that cop in Georgetown, north of Austin, just tripping kids for no reason, and shoving girls down, just for fun, in front of people!
[02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:28.511]  Hell, let him pull a sword out, just kill a few, because he's God.
[02:11:28.531 --> 02:11:34.535]  The samurai, who everybody lionizes, would sometimes test a new blade out on a villager that didn't bow far enough.
[02:11:35.175 --> 02:11:40.059]  And I think that Georgetown cop should have probably just pulled a samurai sword out and killed a half dozen kids, huh?
[02:11:40.699 --> 02:11:41.820]  I'm being sarcastic here.
[02:11:42.741 --> 02:11:46.023]  So, now the BLM says they're going to grab the Red River.
[02:11:47.415 --> 02:11:48.576]  And they'll get more.
[02:11:49.076 --> 02:11:51.737]  So now they're moving into Texas, just declaring it's all theirs.
[02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:54.198]  And let's go ahead and play this report, then I'm going back to your phone calls.
[02:11:54.758 --> 02:11:55.679]  Here is that report.
[02:11:55.979 --> 02:12:01.441]  How can BLM come in and say, hey, this isn't yours even though it was patented from the state?
[02:12:01.681 --> 02:12:03.262]  You've always paid taxes on it.
[02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:06.223]  Our families paid taxes for over 100 years on this place.
[02:12:06.463 --> 02:12:07.664]  We've got a deed to it.
[02:12:07.844 --> 02:12:10.285]  But yet they walked in and said it wasn't ours.
[02:12:11.013 --> 02:12:17.996]  Ever since the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, there has been controversy over where Oklahoma ends and Texas begins.
[02:12:18.556 --> 02:12:22.838]  In layman's terms, the boundary is the vegetation line on the south side of the Red River.
[02:12:23.359 --> 02:12:24.619]  Over time, the river moves.
[02:12:24.999 --> 02:12:28.081]  This movement north towards Oklahoma is the sticking point.
[02:12:28.621 --> 02:12:32.725]  The sandy soils erode in a process called accretion, which wipes out the bank.
[02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:35.107]  So the property line follows the river.
[02:12:35.627 --> 02:12:39.310]  But BLM claims that the river moved by another process called avulsion.
[02:12:39.731 --> 02:12:44.175]  With avulsion, the land may be changed by flood or currents, but the property line isn't.
[02:12:44.595 --> 02:12:48.739]  So BLM claims when the river moved back north, the property line stayed put.
[02:12:49.339 --> 02:12:53.523]  It doesn't help that Oklahoma defines avulsion differently than Texas and the U.S.
[02:12:53.943 --> 02:12:57.845]  Originally, here the river was, after Hurricane Mal... Alright, I don't have time to play it all.
[02:12:57.865 --> 02:12:58.886]  I want to go to your calls.
[02:12:59.626 --> 02:13:01.627]  Look, but listen, it's all over the news in Oklahoma.
[02:13:01.647 --> 02:13:02.328]  It's on Breitbart.
[02:13:02.348 --> 02:13:03.828]  It's on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[02:13:06.009 --> 02:13:09.751]  That, all over the country, they're not just claiming the waterways.
[02:13:10.172 --> 02:13:13.433]  The Mississippi, every hundred years or so, might move 20 miles sometimes.
[02:13:13.694 --> 02:13:17.135]  Are they going to claim wherever the river moves in that process is theirs?
[02:13:17.476 --> 02:13:18.036]  Yes, they are.
[02:13:20.051 --> 02:13:21.812]  And now they're claiming large areas.
[02:13:22.712 --> 02:13:25.834]  Thousands of acres of this guy's property that he has a deed to is theirs.
[02:13:26.615 --> 02:13:28.255]  Because they claim all the rivers in this country.
[02:13:31.257 --> 02:13:32.818]  There's no end to these land grabbers, folks.
[02:13:34.099 --> 02:13:35.499]  It doesn't matter if you've got a deed, buddy.
[02:13:35.519 --> 02:13:37.560]  They've got guns, and they'll kill you!
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:39.561]  Because they're God!
[02:13:39.641 --> 02:13:40.462]  Government's God!
[02:13:40.662 --> 02:13:42.023]  That's what America's all about, right?
[02:13:43.664 --> 02:13:46.025]  Just turn your property over to them.
[02:13:47.346 --> 02:13:48.507]  You evil Oklahoman.
[02:13:49.327 --> 02:13:52.069]  Larry in Michigan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:13:53.170 --> 02:13:54.491]  Yeah, hi there Alex.
[02:13:55.152 --> 02:14:04.018]  You know, I've been watching this Clyde Bundy stuff, but I've never heard anybody talk about these so-called cowboys.
[02:14:04.318 --> 02:14:12.704]  They give them almost a million dollars for these professional cowboys to come in and take, uh, rustle their cattle.
[02:14:13.516 --> 02:14:16.276]  But cowboys wouldn't run cattle to death.
[02:14:16.296 --> 02:14:18.377]  They wouldn't go out and shoot prize bulls.
[02:14:19.037 --> 02:14:19.477]  You know?
[02:14:19.537 --> 02:14:22.918]  By the way, listen, even their fake court order said they couldn't kill cows.
[02:14:23.298 --> 02:14:25.418]  And they vandalized all the water tanks.
[02:14:25.438 --> 02:14:26.398]  They weren't authorized to do that.
[02:14:26.738 --> 02:14:27.178]  The pipes.
[02:14:27.798 --> 02:14:29.579]  And shot his prize cows on purpose.
[02:14:30.039 --> 02:14:31.839]  Because that's what they are, is a bunch of scum.
[02:14:33.519 --> 02:14:34.760]  Professional cowboys.
[02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:41.741]  I guarantee you, if the BLM would have walked over to people politely, I've seen all the videos, and said, listen, there's a court order.
[02:14:42.799 --> 02:14:45.821]  Don't try to go in there and get the cows, or we're going to get in trouble.
[02:14:46.921 --> 02:14:48.422]  Go ahead and protest all you want.
[02:14:48.482 --> 02:14:51.704]  A lot of us don't agree with this, but you need to try the process.
[02:14:51.764 --> 02:14:56.246]  I guarantee you, everybody would have turned around and left, and ended up getting Bundy's land.
[02:14:57.147 --> 02:15:06.151]  But the pointing guns and the sticking their chest out, I mean, when those cops in that boat pulled up to me sticking their chest out and bugging their eyes out, I started just doing it back to them.
[02:15:07.832 --> 02:15:11.094]  And then they had to laugh and see how stupid they were and pull on around laughing.
[02:15:12.773 --> 02:15:16.014]  But that's, they're told, go out and dominate our food.
[02:15:16.554 --> 02:15:19.435]  Let the American people know they are our slaves.
[02:15:19.735 --> 02:15:20.095]  Go ahead.
[02:15:21.335 --> 02:15:21.655]  Yeah.
[02:15:22.235 --> 02:15:25.596]  One more thing, I guess, but then I'll let you go because you've got other calls.
[02:15:26.056 --> 02:15:31.697]  You know, when you go to vote, if you vote for the lesser of two evils, you're still getting evil.
[02:15:33.478 --> 02:15:34.118]  I hear you, brother.
[02:15:34.158 --> 02:15:34.658]  Great points.
[02:15:34.718 --> 02:15:36.078]  I appreciate you calling in, Larry.
[02:15:36.138 --> 02:15:37.639]  Let's talk to Carl in Washington.
[02:15:37.659 --> 02:15:38.179]  You're on the air.
[02:15:39.721 --> 02:15:40.101]  Hey Alex.
[02:15:40.121 --> 02:15:41.482]  Hey brother.
[02:15:41.782 --> 02:15:43.063]  Can you hear?
[02:15:43.183 --> 02:15:43.343]  Yep.
[02:15:44.144 --> 02:15:51.729]  Just a couple things I wanted to touch on was you were talking about reaching people in other countries and everything.
[02:15:51.809 --> 02:16:05.478]  I've been following the Bundy thing on their web page and they're getting tons of people from all kinds of countries and they were live at their celebration thing that night also.
[02:16:06.379 --> 02:16:09.181]  A lot of people are interested in what's going on here.
[02:16:09.932 --> 02:16:10.432]  That's right.
[02:16:10.553 --> 02:16:11.593]  I mean, this thing's perfect.
[02:16:11.834 --> 02:16:13.655]  People are celebrating defeat of the tyrants.
[02:16:13.935 --> 02:16:15.076]  They're celebrating liberty.
[02:16:15.356 --> 02:16:17.118]  They're celebrating walking towards the guns.
[02:16:17.458 --> 02:16:18.179]  This is courage.
[02:16:18.199 --> 02:16:18.899]  This is honor.
[02:16:19.199 --> 02:16:29.487]  This is just the people barely pushing back after bending over to everything, and the statists are pulling their hair out as they sit on top of plunging ratings.
[02:16:31.749 --> 02:16:32.750]  Yeah.
[02:16:33.331 --> 02:16:36.153]  I have a question for you maybe you could answer for me.
[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:38.760]  I put together a video.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:17:04.085]  I'm an Alaskan Indian, but I got this brilliant idea that if you could get tribes to activate that, in a situation like Bundy's where they needed people, that the tribes could make these calls to other tribes and they could activate several thousand people in a real short order of time.
[02:17:04.881 --> 02:17:26.996]  What I'm running into, I used one of your Russell Means videos, part of it, but I'm running into a lot of tribes don't seem to think they're involved and my question I guess to you is, if these guys get lucky and do take over martial law or whatever, how will that affect
[02:17:29.161 --> 02:17:32.242]  People like the Indian Nation and stuff.
[02:17:32.282 --> 02:17:32.982]  Well, that's true.
[02:17:33.022 --> 02:17:40.364]  Listen, the British developed concentration camps, that term, look it up folks, in the 17 and 1800s.
[02:17:41.064 --> 02:17:48.407]  They used them all over, in Africa, in England, in Scotland, and in Europe, and then over here in North America.
[02:17:49.167 --> 02:17:55.969]  So, the reservation was really a concentration camp developed by the British to break a general population
[02:17:57.665 --> 02:18:02.248]  So they wouldn't say they were morally killing them when they were children, they would just put you behind fences until you starved to death.
[02:18:02.748 --> 02:18:06.490]  And those were used in the Civil War by both sides against each other as well.
[02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:08.831]  But the British wrote the book on concentration camps.
[02:18:09.332 --> 02:18:18.837]  And so what Russell Means says in that great video titled, you know, We're All on the Reservation Now, I think is the title, is that regardless of the wrongs done against Native Americans, nobody can debate that.
[02:18:19.237 --> 02:18:22.199]  The new fake liberals and others act like they speak for the natives.
[02:18:22.759 --> 02:18:24.680]  The point is the very same screw jobs
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:25.681]  We're good to go.
[02:18:40.051 --> 02:18:40.912]  Goes back to the Romans.
[02:18:41.752 --> 02:18:45.996]  How do you keep people on the land and in debt if they're not actually a slave?
[02:18:46.956 --> 02:18:51.360]  Well, they had Romans that became sharecroppers about 2,000 years ago.
[02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:55.703]  So the Roman practice of sharecropping is still alive in America today.
[02:18:55.963 --> 02:19:02.148]  There's a sharecropping ranch right next to our ranch that's been there for 160 years.
[02:19:03.809 --> 02:19:05.470]  And it's the same family running it.
[02:19:07.232 --> 02:19:08.653]  The same family running it.
[02:19:09.798 --> 02:19:11.579]  So I hope that answers your question, sir.
[02:19:11.839 --> 02:19:13.040]  We're all sharecroppers.
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:14.300]  We're all Native Americans.
[02:19:14.841 --> 02:19:17.422]  We are all going to be treated just like black people were.
[02:19:18.463 --> 02:19:21.124]  The tyrants will do it to whatever group they can get away with it.
[02:19:21.684 --> 02:19:23.165]  So if they can beat the Indians, they'll do it.
[02:19:23.205 --> 02:19:26.587]  If they can get blacks and get folks convinced that they don't have the same rights, they'll do it to them.
[02:19:27.448 --> 02:19:33.211]  Or if they can bring drugs in, and then people are dumb enough to use them, oh, well, if you use drugs, we can take your house.
[02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:36.012]  See, they always bring in some excuse.
[02:19:36.032 --> 02:19:39.896]  Oh, the Bible says blacks are cursed, so they deserve to be slaves.
[02:19:40.657 --> 02:19:41.477]  The Bible doesn't say that.
[02:19:41.878 --> 02:19:43.159]  But it's always some excuse.
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:47.103]  Or, you know, the natives are savages, so they deserve to have their land taken.
[02:19:48.384 --> 02:19:49.566]  It's always the same story.
[02:19:50.563 --> 02:19:59.729]  The only difference is with Manifest Destiny is that there were a lot of other complex factors and they weren't trying to exterminate everyone.
[02:19:59.749 --> 02:20:01.590]  They just wanted to exterminate the natives and that was bad enough.
[02:20:01.970 --> 02:20:05.152]  Now the globalists want to exterminate everyone because they've stolen the world.
[02:20:05.172 --> 02:20:06.293]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:09.133 --> 02:20:13.537]  More and more people are discovering the incredible benefits of alkalizing the body.

[02:22:08.001 --> 02:22:11.965]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:22:12.026 --> 02:22:16.070]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:22:16.290 --> 02:22:19.674]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:22:19.894 --> 02:22:22.697]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:22:22.857 --> 02:22:30.085]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:22:30.305 --> 02:22:33.928]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:22:34.188 --> 02:22:37.050]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:23:01.086 --> 02:23:11.075]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:23:11.275 --> 02:23:15.019]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:23:15.099 --> 02:23:21.004]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:23:21.284 --> 02:23:25.048]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can
[02:23:25.148 --> 02:23:31.374]  Compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.

[02:23:59.601 --> 02:24:00.942]  Or visit Terragenics.com.
[02:24:00.982 --> 02:24:02.263]  T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[02:24:14.443 --> 02:24:24.895]  The reason I start gibbering and sputtering and getting upset is it's it's hard to come in here three four hours a day and really get aggressive with these people and when I'm looking at all the screw jobs I get mad.
[02:24:26.004 --> 02:24:26.645]  I mean, come on!
[02:24:26.765 --> 02:24:28.226]  Wake up out of your comfort zone!
[02:24:28.767 --> 02:24:29.267]  Wake up!
[02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:30.468]  Get out of your normalcy bias!
[02:24:45.182 --> 02:24:45.963]  Here's another report.
[02:24:46.623 --> 02:24:50.807]  Scientists edit DNA to correct adult genes and cure diseases.
[02:24:51.227 --> 02:24:54.990]  Soon they're going to say under socialist healthcare, your embryo has to be approved.
[02:24:55.330 --> 02:24:56.591]  Then they'll do social engineering.
[02:24:56.831 --> 02:24:58.093]  That's the plan, Brave New World.
[02:24:58.853 --> 02:24:59.253]  Study.
[02:24:59.714 --> 02:25:03.917]  Fuels from corn causing more waste and global warming.
[02:25:03.957 --> 02:25:06.019]  I don't even believe that, but they are wasteful and really bad.
[02:25:06.339 --> 02:25:07.280]  They're meant to starve people.
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:08.181]  That's job number one.
[02:25:09.781 --> 02:25:12.304]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[02:25:13.765 --> 02:25:16.328]  China and Japan are really getting into fights.
[02:25:16.368 --> 02:25:18.289]  China court impounds Japanese ship.
[02:25:18.890 --> 02:25:22.594]  An unprecedented move for ships the Japanese impounded in 1937.
[02:25:22.894 --> 02:25:26.357]  So tit-for-tat is really heating up.
[02:25:26.398 --> 02:25:28.820]  China wants to flex its muscles right now.
[02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:33.004]  Let's jam in some more phone calls ahead of Jakari Jackson's special report.
[02:25:34.225 --> 02:25:35.206]  On the Boston bombing.
[02:25:35.246 --> 02:25:36.527]  The true story of the Boston bombing.
[02:25:36.787 --> 02:25:38.349]  We played the first four minutes yesterday.
[02:25:38.369 --> 02:25:40.651]  A 16-minute segment's coming up in the next segment.
[02:25:40.671 --> 02:25:48.858]  Then David Knight is going to tie the Bundy Ranch into all the other farmers and ranchers and fisheries being shut down all over the United States.
[02:25:49.518 --> 02:25:51.179]  So only the globalists can operate.
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:52.461]  True feudalism.
[02:25:53.041 --> 02:25:55.003]  Let's talk to Mark in California.
[02:25:55.043 --> 02:25:56.204]  Thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:25:57.759 --> 02:25:58.999]  Yeah, three things.
[02:25:59.059 --> 02:26:08.642]  I want you to embellish the judge that ruled that this was a conspiracy, a criminal conspiracy by China to take away the ranchers' lands.
[02:26:09.162 --> 02:26:19.304]  And then also, for the listeners to go to their city councils, I sat for four hours in front of mine in San Jose, and Chuck Reed only gave me a minute.
[02:26:19.344 --> 02:26:24.605]  But I brought a sign down there several times that says, Google John DeCamp Alex Jones, the Franklin cover-up.
[02:26:27.307 --> 02:26:38.299]  Another thing is that the city council is talking to in San Jose to the various citizens about various issues that the policeman told me to sit down and shut up.
[02:26:38.459 --> 02:26:42.464]  So I did that when I got up I mentioned that that policeman told me to sit down.
[02:26:43.084 --> 02:26:47.130]  And to shut up, for Mark Trout to sit down and shut up is exact words.
[02:26:47.791 --> 02:26:51.115]  Oh yeah, everywhere they're telling people they can't even have their three minutes of communication.
[02:26:51.416 --> 02:26:58.386]  Because job number one is to keep the scum down, get ready to collapse the dollar and steal the pension funds, and they've got to teach you not to be uppity when that happens.
[02:26:59.972 --> 02:27:00.232]  Yeah.
[02:27:00.733 --> 02:27:07.417]  Now, this was a judge that ruled this conspiracy, uh, criminal conspiracy with Red China, correct?
[02:27:07.637 --> 02:27:08.938]  No, no, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:27:08.978 --> 02:27:21.287]  No, last year, in Nevada, Federal Judge Jones, there's an article up on Infowars.com, ruled the BLM for the last 20 years was in a criminal conspiracy to bankrupt the ranchers of the state to take their land.
[02:27:22.782 --> 02:27:26.264]  Okay, federal judge BLM engaged in a criminal conspiracy against ranchers.
[02:27:26.564 --> 02:27:27.865]  That's about the BLM.
[02:27:28.346 --> 02:27:31.488]  It doesn't deal with the Bundy case, even though he was part of the overall situation.
[02:27:32.208 --> 02:27:34.550]  What proves China's involved is the BLM documents.
[02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:37.391]  Alright, he called from I forget which affiliate.
[02:27:37.411 --> 02:27:38.512]  I should plug these stations.
[02:27:38.972 --> 02:27:40.353]  That was the one out in Santa Cruz.
[02:27:41.094 --> 02:27:46.757]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois, listening on 1420 AM WLUV.
[02:27:47.478 --> 02:27:49.739]  And Mike, you're on the air from Illinois.
[02:27:49.779 --> 02:27:50.260]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:27:51.226 --> 02:27:51.967]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:27:51.987 --> 02:27:52.827]  I'm doing alright, brother.
[02:27:52.847 --> 02:27:53.367]  Thanks for calling.
[02:27:54.208 --> 02:27:55.509]  Well, here's a couple things.
[02:27:56.329 --> 02:27:59.071]  You know, I listen to you every day, as often as I can.
[02:28:01.333 --> 02:28:11.119]  It almost seems like you're being optimistic about, you know, like what we can do because it seems like, you know, like that BLM standoff in Nevada.
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:15.562]  I mean, that could have ended totally different, you know, and then what?
[02:28:16.198 --> 02:28:24.983]  Well, you know, then they shoot a bunch of innocent people and we have the big victory for having the courage in the start of the new physical civil war.
[02:28:25.444 --> 02:28:26.584]  We're already being attacked.
[02:28:26.744 --> 02:28:28.085]  I don't want a physical civil war.
[02:28:28.425 --> 02:28:30.567]  I want freedom for those BLM people and everybody else.
[02:28:31.167 --> 02:28:32.528]  The government's out of control.
[02:28:32.648 --> 02:28:33.509]  No one can deny it.
[02:28:33.529 --> 02:28:36.230]  A lot of people are scared now and realize how real this is.
[02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:38.392]  So they decided to join with the government and say,
[02:28:39.412 --> 02:28:41.193]  Any civil disobedience is terrorism.
[02:28:41.633 --> 02:28:42.593]  Well, I don't agree with that.
[02:28:42.653 --> 02:28:43.974]  And I didn't want violence to happen.
[02:28:44.274 --> 02:28:50.136]  But when you got the Feds threatening to shoot people, the fact that some folks were there and had guns, that's what the Second Amendment's for.
[02:28:50.936 --> 02:28:53.557]  And so, we're not the ones engaging in the violence.
[02:28:53.937 --> 02:28:55.238]  We don't want this to happen.
[02:28:55.758 --> 02:28:57.599]  And believe me, the Feds are freaked out right now.
[02:28:58.099 --> 02:29:00.320]  They thought everybody would turn back being threatened to be shot.
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:00.820]  They weren't.
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:02.720]  And that's a lesson for them.
[02:29:03.821 --> 02:29:06.662]  We're going to make the French Resistance look like
[02:29:08.126 --> 02:29:11.348]  A literal cakewalk, okay?
[02:29:11.608 --> 02:29:14.570]  And it doesn't matter how many lemmings they've got going along with it.
[02:29:14.850 --> 02:29:15.910]  I don't want it to go to that.
[02:29:16.390 --> 02:29:17.231]  I want to fix things.
[02:29:17.911 --> 02:29:19.472]  The globalists want to have a civil war.
[02:29:19.992 --> 02:29:23.354]  Not that they'll even win it, but it's better than them losing everything politically.
[02:29:24.035 --> 02:29:25.275]  They're cornered, my friend.
[02:29:25.555 --> 02:29:26.756]  They're going to pull something.
[02:29:27.677 --> 02:29:31.178]  And people are tired of... I mean, was Bundy supposed to go bankrupt and go climb a ditch?
[02:29:31.439 --> 02:29:31.859]  What do you think?
[02:29:32.932 --> 02:29:35.313]  Well, I think the whole thing was BS.
[02:29:35.633 --> 02:29:37.074]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:29:37.654 --> 02:29:45.117]  I mean, you're talking about, you know, people that have had deeds to their property for 80 years, and, you know, they're just coming and saying, hey, it's not yours anymore.
[02:29:45.777 --> 02:29:47.418]  And how the hell is Harry Reid
[02:29:48.291 --> 02:29:49.492]  Are people stupid?
[02:29:49.572 --> 02:29:52.315]  How is Harry Reid not drug out by his hair?
[02:30:09.449 --> 02:30:12.692]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:30:12.792 --> 02:30:15.034]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:30:15.214 --> 02:30:23.521]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:30:23.821 --> 02:30:34.010]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:30:34.350 --> 02:30:47.756]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, and then concentrated for maximum potency, Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:30:48.157 --> 02:30:55.500]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose for a limited time.
[02:30:55.700 --> 02:31:03.103]  We are offering 15% off Supermail Vitality at Infowarslife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[02:31:09.594 --> 02:31:13.576]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:31:13.616 --> 02:31:18.199]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:31:18.239 --> 02:31:21.421]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:31:21.641 --> 02:31:24.542]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:31:24.703 --> 02:31:32.067]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:31:32.247 --> 02:31:35.909]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:31:36.169 --> 02:31:40.411]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:31:40.591 --> 02:31:46.513]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:31:46.553 --> 02:31:50.335]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:31:50.495 --> 02:31:53.036]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:31:53.236 --> 02:31:54.577]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:31:54.737 --> 02:31:55.977]  It's time to take action.
[02:31:56.097 --> 02:31:57.758]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:32:09.608 --> 02:32:16.791]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:32:16.891 --> 02:32:19.071]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:32:19.251 --> 02:32:24.433]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:32:24.593 --> 02:32:29.675]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:32:29.835 --> 02:32:32.937]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:32:33.217 --> 02:32:37.139]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:32:37.359 --> 02:32:41.661]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:32:41.741 --> 02:32:51.906]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:32:52.106 --> 02:32:54.647]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:32:54.967 --> 02:32:56.448]  We are on the march.
[02:32:56.568 --> 02:32:58.129]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:32:58.149 --> 02:32:59.489]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:25.484 --> 02:33:30.688]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and we've got a special report from Jakari Jackson about the Boston bombing.
[02:33:30.728 --> 02:33:35.811]  This is the one-year anniversary, but I want you to see the kind of police state that is still going on.
[02:33:36.131 --> 02:33:43.516]  This is a story that's linked on the Drudge Report, on the right-hand side of the Drudge Report, a video of TSA agents patting down two and six-year-old children.
[02:33:43.856 --> 02:33:50.981]  This is a video, the child appears to say something like, I need to go, and is clearly uncomfortable with the pat-down, as they should be.
[02:33:51.381 --> 02:33:55.124]  This is nothing but child molestation and the phony name of security.
[02:33:56.125 --> 02:34:00.107]  And this is something they were supposed to have stopped doing years and years ago.
[02:34:00.608 --> 02:34:05.231]  But this is the kind of police state that people are embracing in the aftermath of the Boston bombing.
[02:34:05.311 --> 02:34:06.432]  Here's Jakar's report.
[02:34:08.253 --> 02:34:08.814]  We're live.
[02:34:08.834 --> 02:34:11.456]  It's 2-0-8 Central.
[02:34:11.516 --> 02:34:13.617]  And two explosions at Boston Marathon.
[02:34:14.258 --> 02:34:16.139]  People hurt in large explosions.
[02:34:16.399 --> 02:34:17.040]  Oh man.
[02:34:18.481 --> 02:34:19.242]  Oh my gosh.
[02:34:19.282 --> 02:34:22.284]  And that old... Are they going to blame it on Iran?
[02:34:22.324 --> 02:34:23.405]  Blame it on the Patriot group?
[02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:26.162]  Or is it going to be a veteran or something?
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:58.149]  At the airport, then it's the mall, then it's the sports stadium, then it's the hotel, then it's the highway, then it's the bus station, it's already in Austin, then it's Army at the kite festival, then it's, oh, any event has to have, you know, troops at it.
[02:34:58.489 --> 02:35:02.011]  Drudge now running the headline, explosions at Boston Marathon.
[02:35:02.691 --> 02:35:07.535]  And it goes multiple people injured, at least a dozen injured after explosion.
[02:35:07.876 --> 02:35:11.479]  Man, I hope this isn't a false flag or a real terror attack, Richard.
[02:35:11.879 --> 02:35:16.924]  Even if it's innocent, they will use it because everyone's focused on it now.
[02:35:17.544 --> 02:35:24.010]  And people can be controlled when they're all on the same emotion at the same time.
[02:35:24.030 --> 02:35:28.414]  You know, the government's been studying this since, you know, World War I. Let's fade this up.
[02:35:28.454 --> 02:35:28.534]  CNN?
[02:35:29.875 --> 02:35:32.277]  I hate to say it but these are the times that we live in.
[02:35:46.668 --> 02:35:48.610]  Richard, that's what they're saying on CNN.
[02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:51.453]  So they're already basically saying it's a terror attack.
[02:35:51.594 --> 02:35:52.294]  Oh my goodness.
[02:35:52.755 --> 02:35:54.336]  We're helpless is what he's saying.
[02:35:54.577 --> 02:35:55.117]  I know this.
[02:35:55.458 --> 02:35:57.960]  They got TSA ready to roll out nationwide.
[02:35:58.241 --> 02:36:01.003]  They're already doing it, but they've been... I've talked to insiders.
[02:36:01.023 --> 02:36:02.505]  They're going to be everywhere now.
[02:36:02.585 --> 02:36:04.227]  Just federal checkpoints.
[02:36:04.547 --> 02:36:07.630]  When he said, you know, unfortunately these are times we live in.
[02:36:08.411 --> 02:36:18.699]  So then when we see soldiers at our kids' Little League game, we see soldiers, you know, everywhere, well, we're supposed to feel safe?
[02:36:18.959 --> 02:36:28.546]  But again, the explosion, the main one there at the Marathon Sports, and then you can hear after that, Paula, it's just absolutely heartbreaking to see this.
[02:36:28.646 --> 02:36:31.828]  It's been a year since the bomb attack at the Boston Marathon.
[02:36:32.249 --> 02:36:36.492]  InfoWars was pointing out the inconsistencies in the story from the very beginning.
[02:36:36.912 --> 02:36:38.233]  Was there any prior knowledge of it?
[02:36:38.253 --> 02:36:44.616]  Because according to BostonGlobe.com, they said they were doing drills this morning for the same exact thing to happen, according to BostonGlobe.com.
[02:36:44.916 --> 02:36:48.458]  Now, were you guys given any warning ahead of time of this taking place?
[02:36:48.798 --> 02:36:51.479]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence.
[02:36:51.519 --> 02:36:56.542]  Sir, why were loudspeakers telling people in the audience to be calm moments before the bomb went off?
[02:36:56.902 --> 02:37:03.025]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeland security sticking their hands down on the pants on the streets?
[02:37:03.345 --> 02:37:03.545]  No.
[02:37:04.026 --> 02:37:07.049]  And it wasn't just the Boston Globe who reported the drills.
[02:37:07.389 --> 02:37:21.764]  There was dogs with their handlers going around sniffing for explosives and we were told on a loud announcement that we shouldn't be concerned if it was just a drill.
[02:37:22.865 --> 02:37:25.668]  So maybe it was just a drill.
[02:37:27.591 --> 02:37:30.072]  But I've just never seen a drill like that.
[02:37:30.372 --> 02:37:34.794]  The most show of force that a track coach has seen in a lifetime of marathons.
[02:37:35.174 --> 02:37:37.254]  This brings up questions of prior knowledge.
[02:37:37.695 --> 02:37:45.957]  And on the subject of prior knowledge, we found out that the CIA, FBI and DHS knew of Tamerlan Tsarnaev before the bombing.
[02:37:46.398 --> 02:37:51.439]  Reports show that the older Tsarnaev had previously attended a workshop sponsored by the CIA.
[02:37:51.639 --> 02:37:53.180]  The word is also out that the FBI
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:38:00.106]  The FBI and Department of Homeland Security had been tipped to Tamlin's visit to a radical mosque in Dagestan, a neighbor of Chechnya.
[02:38:00.366 --> 02:38:04.410]  The FBI felt that this was of little consequence and didn't consider him a threat.
[02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:10.755]  Also, the suspect's uncle Ruslan, who quickly distanced himself from his nephews, worked for you said.
[02:38:11.116 --> 02:38:12.237]  As the article points out,
[02:38:12.637 --> 02:38:13.098]  The U.S.
[02:38:13.238 --> 02:38:17.003]  Agency for International Development is an agency used by the U.S.
[02:38:17.043 --> 02:38:23.853]  government to operate humanitarian NGOs instrumental in running color revolutions in former Soviet states.
[02:38:24.514 --> 02:38:28.320]  And he just so happened to be the relative of choice for state-run media.
[02:38:29.102 --> 02:38:32.603]  I understand that there must be several criminals and other people on U.S.
[02:38:32.643 --> 02:38:36.804]  data banks, especially with the DHS putting toddlers on the no-fly list.
[02:38:37.284 --> 02:38:51.347]  But if you have a suspect who the Russian government warned you about, attended CIA-backed workshops that the DHS was briefed on, and the FBI interviewed, why does the FBI need public assistance identifying the suspect?
[02:38:51.787 --> 02:38:57.968]  Not to mention how the Feds reportedly called the Tsarnaev brothers after the bombing and before any other incidents.
[02:38:58.448 --> 02:39:05.130]  Somebody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbors, co-workers, or family members of the suspects.
[02:39:05.930 --> 02:39:11.612]  Though it may be difficult, the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us.
[02:39:12.112 --> 02:39:15.013]  Did you ask any of your co-workers they're agents?
[02:39:15.633 --> 02:39:22.695]  Aside from Stonewalling Info Wars reporter Dan Badondi, Goon's gotten his face for dare asking real questions.
[02:39:23.217 --> 02:39:29.122]  Are both suspects seen planting these devices at the finish line of the Baltimore Motorway?
[02:39:29.262 --> 02:39:29.422]  No.
[02:39:29.442 --> 02:39:29.883]  At what time?
[02:39:30.263 --> 02:39:30.723]  At what time?
[02:39:30.763 --> 02:39:35.327]  The only one who was observed planting what we believe to be the device is suspect number two with a white cap.
[02:39:35.587 --> 02:39:37.089]  Let's talk about those photos.
[02:39:37.409 --> 02:39:38.930]  There was bomb drills Monday morning.
[02:39:38.970 --> 02:39:41.833]  We got photographs on Infowars.com, folks, of hundreds
[02:39:42.493 --> 02:39:43.374]  Next question, please.
[02:39:43.654 --> 02:39:50.880]  Jihar's white or gray backpack with the black stripes is clearly not the black backpack with the white or gray stripes that exploded.
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:53.742]  In fact, the bags are the exact opposite.
[02:39:53.823 --> 02:39:59.107]  The only official photos that should be officially relied upon in this investigation are those you see before you today.
[02:39:59.227 --> 02:40:02.570]  So what's the possible explanation for these bizarro backpacks?
[02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.971]  There's one theory.
[02:40:04.011 --> 02:40:11.198]  Doubt of the official story could have easily been squashed by releasing footage of the bomb being placed.
[02:40:11.218 --> 02:40:15.622]  Footage that even Governor Deval Patrick hasn't seen.
[02:40:25.871 --> 02:40:42.823]  Well, the videotape is not something I've seen, it's been described to me, but it does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down...
[02:40:43.363 --> 02:40:45.945]  And that brings up another piece of questionable footage.
[02:40:46.326 --> 02:40:47.647]  Who was the naked man?
[02:40:48.087 --> 02:40:56.034]  InfoWars reporter David Knight contacted Merit Tsarnaev, the aunt of the suspects, who identified the stripped man as her nephew Tamerlan.
[02:40:56.054 --> 02:40:57.915]  Hello.
[02:40:57.955 --> 02:40:59.537]  Hello, is this Merit Tsarnaev?
[02:40:59.557 --> 02:41:00.798]  Yes, speaking.
[02:41:01.198 --> 02:41:02.499]  Hi, my name is David Knight.
[02:41:02.539 --> 02:41:04.120]  I'm with InfoWars.com.
[02:41:04.421 --> 02:41:06.362]  It's Alex Jones' operation.
[02:41:06.402 --> 02:41:07.303]  Have you heard of us?
[02:41:07.883 --> 02:41:09.144]  Yes, I have heard of you.
[02:41:09.184 --> 02:41:11.006]  And we would very much like to do an interview with you.
[02:41:11.026 --> 02:41:11.747]  Would that be possible?
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:27.311]  Since I have seen the material that you presented to the public before, about the United States bombing, even before the names of our boys were put out there, I was following you, you know, from the very beginning.
[02:41:28.612 --> 02:41:38.500]  I don't know, I have trust in that information, I have trust in you, and I would like to have my word said.
[02:41:39.281 --> 02:41:39.901]  Good, good.
[02:41:40.001 --> 02:41:41.303]  Especially in the part when
[02:41:42.670 --> 02:41:51.217]  The guy that is, that was taken into custody by police and given over to FBI?
[02:41:52.278 --> 02:41:53.499]  You know who I'm talking about?
[02:41:53.519 --> 02:41:53.579]  Yes.
[02:41:53.599 --> 02:41:54.440]  That clip?
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:55.320]  Yes, yes.
[02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:56.061]  The naked guy?
[02:41:56.401 --> 02:41:56.621]  Yes.
[02:41:56.741 --> 02:42:08.471]  I have to, I have to publicly state that I confirm and identify this person as my nephew, Kamerlan Tsarnaev.
[02:42:09.192 --> 02:42:12.174]  Moretz's revelation has been widely ignored by the media.
[02:42:12.434 --> 02:42:18.918]  The outlets that did pick up the naked man's arrest quickly wrote him off as somebody who was not really a suspect in the first place.
[02:42:19.598 --> 02:42:27.643]  Before we go any further, let's talk about what the brothers allegedly did after the bombing, aside from reportedly talking to the FBI as we mentioned earlier.
[02:42:28.023 --> 02:42:30.565]  The story goes that the two had a seemingly normal life.
[02:42:30.925 --> 02:42:39.767]  Jahar went back to school, but after being named suspects, the brothers went on the run and allegedly killed an MIT officer to get his gun, thus the story goes.
[02:42:40.147 --> 02:42:47.309]  To date, there is no DNA evidence or public photographic evidence that the brothers actually killed the officer in his patrol car.
[02:42:47.689 --> 02:42:53.150]  And just like with the placing of the bomb, the authorities want you to believe in footage that they refuse to show you.
[02:42:53.490 --> 02:42:55.410]  So where did this story come from?
[02:42:55.610 --> 02:42:59.991]  It's a theory that the brothers wanted a gun and targeted someone who would have one.
[02:43:00.171 --> 02:43:03.552]  But whoever killed Officer Collier didn't bother to take his weapon.
[02:43:03.812 --> 02:43:04.912]  Now let me be very clear.
[02:43:04.992 --> 02:43:08.053]  This is in no way to tarnish the image of the slain officer.
[02:43:08.373 --> 02:43:10.513]  All due respect to him and his family.
[02:43:10.673 --> 02:43:15.134]  I'm simply pointing out how hearsay surrounding his death is now considered gospel.
[02:43:15.494 --> 02:43:17.235]  But what about the carjacking victim?
[02:43:17.555 --> 02:43:18.955]  Didn't the brothers confess to him?
[02:43:19.415 --> 02:43:22.416]  Well, there are conflicting narratives concerning that, too.
[02:43:22.776 --> 02:43:28.017]  Briefly, the carjacking victim known as Danny reported a movie-like escape from the Tsarnaev brothers.
[02:43:28.257 --> 02:43:34.839]  But before he got away, Danny says Tamerlan confessed to killing the MIT officer, as well as a role in the bombing.
[02:43:35.259 --> 02:43:41.600]  Contrast that with an earlier interview where Danny says Tamerlan mentioned the bombing, but said nothing of the MIT shooting.
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:43.601]  Draw your own conclusion there.
[02:43:44.261 --> 02:43:48.422]  Oh, and the 7-11 robbery that took place, that wasn't the Tsarnaev brothers.
[02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:57.309]  When the government and the shadow government has been gearing up to roll out and be our savior, and they stand to gain from it, it's obvious.
[02:43:57.389 --> 02:44:03.376]  I mean, whoever the suspect is, the government will appropriate it and create a narrative.
[02:44:04.407 --> 02:44:16.756]  And 90% of it probably, I'm just guessing, will be a fabrication to shape our thought of police and military and safety, and they're licking their chops.
[02:44:16.976 --> 02:44:20.579]  They're now saying, were there right-winger patriot meetings in the area?
[02:44:20.599 --> 02:44:21.600]  Uh-oh.
[02:44:21.900 --> 02:44:22.260]  Uh-oh.
[02:44:22.521 --> 02:44:23.101]  Oh, man.
[02:44:23.201 --> 02:44:24.362]  And that's CNN doing that?
[02:44:24.382 --> 02:44:25.763]  Oh.
[02:44:26.624 --> 02:44:28.225]  Wolf Blitzer, we are in trouble.
[02:44:28.385 --> 02:44:28.925]  Oh, man.
[02:44:29.286 --> 02:44:31.327]  I bet they even dragged me into it with my 1776 line.
[02:44:40.327 --> 02:44:44.492]  That was footage from the, quote, shootout between the Tsarnaev brothers and the police.
[02:44:44.873 --> 02:44:57.328]  This is one of the most contradictory moments following the bombing, with various witnesses contesting whether or not the suspects tossed bombs at the police, whether or not an officer was injured by friendly fire, and whether or not Jahar ran over Tamerlan.
[02:44:57.728 --> 02:45:08.073]  If the naked man is Tamlin Zarnaev, as his aunt claims, then the official story has much to explain as to how a bullet-wounded man was struck by a car and appears virtually uninjured.
[02:45:08.373 --> 02:45:17.117]  Regardless of what happened, after the confrontation with the police, Jahar is able to go and hide himself in a boat, and Tamlin is taken into custody, according to his aunt.
[02:45:17.577 --> 02:45:24.160]  The police state rolled into Watertown with a vengeance, intimidating media, forcing people out of their homes at gunpoint.
[02:45:25.407 --> 02:45:29.768]  Door-to-door armed searches without warrant.
[02:45:30.248 --> 02:45:38.590]  Police don't need warrants if property owners welcome them into their homes.
[02:45:39.491 --> 02:45:47.133]  Families thrown out of their homes at gunpoint to be searched without probable cause.
[02:45:47.873 --> 02:45:52.374]  No guns were pointed at any families.
[02:45:52.714 --> 02:45:56.329]  Let's watch that clip again covered by footage of what actually happened.
[02:45:57.708 --> 02:46:02.049]  Door-to-door armed searches without warrant.
[02:46:02.549 --> 02:46:10.891]  Police don't need warrants if property owners welcome them into their homes.
[02:46:11.791 --> 02:46:19.433]  Families thrown out of their homes at gunpoint to be searched without probable cause.
[02:46:20.173 --> 02:46:24.674]  No guns were pointed at any families.
[02:46:25.014 --> 02:46:30.338]  But as you saw with your own eyes, people were forced out of their homes and had guns pointed at them.
[02:46:30.718 --> 02:46:35.642]  In the end, it was a homeowner who called the police to report suspicious activity in his boat.
[02:46:35.922 --> 02:46:43.488]  Police responded, fired multiple rounds into the boat, and I'm sure were shocked when Jahar was able to climb out of the boat under his own power.
[02:46:43.808 --> 02:46:48.452]  He is bloodied, but doesn't yet seem to have the wound in his mouth that would be reported later.
[02:46:48.692 --> 02:46:52.235]  If he indeed shot himself through the mouth, I doubt he'd be this mobile.
[02:46:52.435 --> 02:46:55.977]  And it's a pretty safe bet that he'd be suffering much heavier blood loss.
[02:46:56.437 --> 02:46:58.939]  Jahar is currently in custody awaiting trial.
[02:46:59.199 --> 02:47:01.261]  His brother Tamerlan is now deceased.
[02:47:01.681 --> 02:47:06.444]  But even with one suspect dead and another in jail, the story didn't end there.
[02:47:06.885 --> 02:47:10.507]  An acquaintance of Tamerlan was killed during an FBI interrogation.
[02:47:10.948 --> 02:47:15.371]  The FBI's story changed multiple times as to how their agent felt his life was in danger.
[02:47:15.911 --> 02:47:17.833]  That night I was actually in Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:47:32.264 --> 02:47:32.824]  We're good to go.
[02:47:58.889 --> 02:47:59.590]  Don't be quiet.
[02:47:59.650 --> 02:48:01.773]  Just say what happened to me, if anything happens.
[02:48:02.174 --> 02:48:02.895]  He wasn't scared.
[02:48:03.536 --> 02:48:06.460]  If he would, he probably would not even speak with them in the first place.
[02:48:06.820 --> 02:48:11.106]  But since he was invited to our home, that means he wasn't scared of them.
[02:48:14.312 --> 02:48:16.073]  They have interviewed him.
[02:48:16.313 --> 02:48:18.375]  He would not respond to his cell phone or anything.
[02:48:18.515 --> 02:48:24.419]  And they have his friend waiting him outside, but suddenly they let him go after four hours.
[02:48:25.319 --> 02:48:29.021]  And some of the agents were still with Ibrahim.
[02:48:29.502 --> 02:48:37.747]  And right now they've been pulling so many statements that he was armed and he was unarmed, and that his body was away.
[02:48:37.867 --> 02:48:38.147]  I don't
[02:48:56.349 --> 02:48:57.610]  He had seven shots.
[02:48:57.991 --> 02:48:59.332]  One was in the back of the head.
[02:49:00.033 --> 02:49:05.099]  And it has nothing to do with him start attacking them as they said.
[02:49:05.139 --> 02:49:09.104]  They're coming with the knife, with the blade, with the broom, with the swords.
[02:49:10.325 --> 02:49:13.289]  I think they came with the five different statements.
[02:49:14.247 --> 02:49:16.489]  Yeah, for those who don't know, it's important you say that.
[02:49:16.749 --> 02:49:19.872]  They've now admitted that he didn't have a weapon, didn't attack him.
[02:49:19.932 --> 02:49:31.263]  So as the runners take to the streets once again, let us not forget all of the lies, half-truths, disinformation, and teleprompter reading that has hindered justice for all of the victims of April 15, 2013.
[02:49:33.605 --> 02:49:36.888]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[02:49:37.467 --> 02:49:44.633]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million YouTube, uh, well, he has 300 million people that have watched him on YouTube.
[02:49:45.074 --> 02:49:46.775]  That's a great report from Jakari Jackson.
[02:49:46.855 --> 02:49:52.100]  I want to make it clear that we pointed out at the time, and one of the reasons that they put these guys up as patsies,
[02:49:52.660 --> 02:50:00.724]  Was because we're making it clear at the time that the Southern Poverty Law Center and the mainstream media, Mockingbird Press, and I'm not using that as a metaphor, that's a CIA operation.
[02:50:01.124 --> 02:50:03.105]  They were setting up patriots.
[02:50:03.285 --> 02:50:10.109]  They were going to blame this on quote-unquote right-wing patriots like we see them creating that narrative right now at the Bundy Ranch.
[02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:13.250]  First they assassinate your character, then they assassinate you.
[02:50:13.651 --> 02:50:15.171]  We're going to talk about that when we come back.
[02:50:15.191 --> 02:50:17.052]  We're going to talk about how they're setting this up.
[02:50:17.753 --> 02:50:19.574]  And we're also going to talk about Agenda 21.
[02:50:19.854 --> 02:50:21.795]  Look at what they're doing though, just this last week.
[02:50:22.355 --> 02:50:33.579]  We had, the Monday after the showdown on Saturday, we had Glenn Beck put Mr. Bundy on his show and start pushing the idea that he's part of the sovereign citizen movement.
[02:50:34.139 --> 02:50:40.721]  That is a loaded term, that's a loaded label that law enforcement has been trained to perceive as a direct immediate threat to their safety.
[02:50:41.121 --> 02:50:43.984]  Ben, three days later we got Harry Reid talking about domestic terrorists.
[02:50:44.024 --> 02:50:47.607]  Now today, we've got MSNBC talking about insurgents.
[02:50:47.647 --> 02:50:50.870]  They're keeping the rhetoric, they're building it, they're trying to create that narrative.
[02:50:50.890 --> 02:50:52.932]  We're going to talk to you about that right after the break.
[02:51:08.925 --> 02:51:10.026]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:10.126 --> 02:51:14.448]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:14.608 --> 02:51:20.230]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:20.330 --> 02:51:23.672]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:51:23.892 --> 02:51:26.453]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:26.573 --> 02:51:31.396]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:51:31.536 --> 02:51:31.756]  Call 800-686-2237.

[02:51:42.913 --> 02:51:47.495]  The Peacekeeper Mini by Tigerlite is the latest in high-tech self-defense.
[02:51:48.135 --> 02:51:55.137]  Combining the number one rated Tigerlite with the amazing new Bluetooth GPS crowd alert technology.
[02:51:55.377 --> 02:51:56.538]  There is nothing like it.

[02:52:08.021 --> 02:52:11.983]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:52:12.003 --> 02:52:16.085]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:52:16.305 --> 02:52:19.646]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:52:19.907 --> 02:52:22.728]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:52:22.868 --> 02:52:30.131]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:52:30.331 --> 02:52:33.913]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:52:34.093 --> 02:52:38.356]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:52:38.516 --> 02:52:44.359]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:52:44.399 --> 02:52:48.102]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:52:48.282 --> 02:52:50.783]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:52:50.963 --> 02:52:52.304]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:52:52.444 --> 02:52:53.645]  It's time to take action.
[02:52:53.785 --> 02:52:55.466]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:53:09.460 --> 02:53:11.181]  Attention men suffering from ED.
[02:53:11.421 --> 02:53:14.903]  My name's Matt Cook and I hated the humiliation and embarrassment of ED.
[02:53:15.023 --> 02:53:17.004]  I couldn't stand disappointing my wife anymore.
[02:53:17.304 --> 02:53:20.446]  Then I discovered this strange exercise that makes ED go away.
[02:53:20.706 --> 02:53:26.329]  I made you this new video at QuickEDFix.com showing you how easy it is to fix ED better than pills.
[02:53:26.629 --> 02:53:31.892]  Now my wife and I are like newlyweds again thanks to this strange exercise that fixed my ED better than pills.
[02:53:32.172 --> 02:53:33.873]  And it works for almost all men who try it.
[02:53:34.073 --> 02:53:37.695]  My half of our love life is better than anything I've ever experienced before.
[02:53:37.895 --> 02:53:38.916]  Things are so much better now.
[02:53:39.236 --> 02:53:41.057]  Everything kind of came back overnight.
[02:53:41.197 --> 02:53:43.238]  My girlfriend is very happy.
[02:53:43.478 --> 02:53:46.480]  I have used your system for about three weeks, and I'm already seeing great results.
[02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:47.120]  But warning!
[02:53:47.341 --> 02:53:51.343]  The drug companies dread my strange exercise because it fixes ED better than pills.
[02:53:51.443 --> 02:53:53.944]  They hate the lost profits from men dumping their pills.
[02:53:54.105 --> 02:53:55.525]  They want me to take the video down.
[02:53:55.726 --> 02:53:57.907]  So watch now at QuickEDFix.com.
[02:53:58.127 --> 02:54:01.269]  Discover the strange exercise that fixes ED better than pills.

[02:54:25.076 --> 02:54:26.598]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:26.618 --> 02:54:27.198]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:27.238 --> 02:54:37.989]  I'll be concluding the show today, and we'll try to take your calls in overdrive if we've got time, but I've got to cover some of this news about what's breaking across the country, because it's not just the Nomada Ranch.
[02:54:38.550 --> 02:54:46.052]  The same sort of thing is happening to small family businesses that have been in business for generations in North Carolina with fisheries.
[02:54:46.612 --> 02:54:50.374]  And it's the same type of tactics that we see being used against the Bundys.
[02:54:50.834 --> 02:54:52.774]  But before I get into that, let's repeat this.
[02:54:53.555 --> 02:54:56.836]  TSA agents patting down two and six-year-old children.
[02:54:56.896 --> 02:54:58.896]  This is a story that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:54:58.936 --> 02:55:00.137]  It's linked on the Drudge Report.
[02:55:00.977 --> 02:55:07.059]  Absolutely amazing and repulsive what they're doing to our children, what we're letting them do to our children.
[02:55:07.339 --> 02:55:07.799]  Listen to this.
[02:55:08.419 --> 02:55:14.605]  In response to a huge backlash, the TSA amended its policy in 2011 to massively reduce pat-downs of children under the age of 12.
[02:55:15.125 --> 02:55:23.553]  Infants were allowed to pass through x-ray or body scanners multiple times if there's any anomaly in order to prevent the need for a physical search.
[02:55:24.747 --> 02:55:29.270]  Okay, what are we doing allowing them to search our children, to put their hands all over their bodies?
[02:55:29.410 --> 02:55:34.574]  Clearly in this video, the girl that was having this done to her, the six-year-old girl says, I've got to go, I've got to go.
[02:55:34.614 --> 02:55:35.455]  She's not comfortable with that.
[02:55:35.635 --> 02:55:36.696]  She shouldn't be comfortable with that.
[02:55:37.056 --> 02:55:38.097]  I'm not comfortable with that.
[02:55:38.897 --> 02:55:41.619]  David Simpson here in Texas was not comfortable with that.
[02:55:41.699 --> 02:55:47.384]  He put in a bill in 2011, and it immediately passed in the House, and when it got to the Senate,
[02:55:48.083 --> 02:55:53.365]  Dewhurst, our Lieutenant Governor, who has, his previous job description was all CIA stuff.
[02:55:53.385 --> 02:55:54.585]  These guys walked it back.
[02:55:54.625 --> 02:55:57.746]  They basically threatened to turn Texas into a no-fly zone.
[02:55:58.107 --> 02:55:59.347]  And we found the documents.
[02:55:59.707 --> 02:56:01.628]  John Corbett, in part of his lawsuit,
[02:56:02.742 --> 02:56:19.187]  and discovery he listed documents that he was allowed to see uh... and basically the government put on pacer.gov they listed the unredacted portion of the lawsuit where he quoted them saying that in two thousand eleven at the same time the threatening to turn texas into a no-fly zone
[02:56:20.647 --> 02:56:26.250]  They were saying internally, in their own documents, that there was no threat to airplanes or airports.
[02:56:26.290 --> 02:56:27.730]  The whole thing was a lie.
[02:56:27.810 --> 02:56:28.411]  It's a fraud.
[02:56:28.471 --> 02:56:30.091]  Why are we letting them do this to our children?
[02:56:30.412 --> 02:56:35.174]  David Simpson tried to walk that back, not only then in 2011, but he tried to do it last year.
[02:56:35.234 --> 02:56:40.316]  Both times he lost thanks to people like David Dewhurst, Republican CIA member.
[02:56:40.916 --> 02:56:41.997]  Who walked this thing back.
[02:56:42.037 --> 02:56:43.139]  Now we see it happening again.
[02:56:43.399 --> 02:56:48.064]  And why are we allowing our children to be passed through x-ray machines multiple times?
[02:56:48.505 --> 02:56:51.388]  So that they don't get touched by these invasive goons.
[02:56:52.069 --> 02:56:54.832]  Why would we let our kids be passed through x-ray machines multiple times?
[02:56:54.852 --> 02:56:56.534]  That's absolutely asinine.
[02:56:56.995 --> 02:56:59.237]  But I want to get back to this situation here at the Bundy Ranch.
[02:56:59.958 --> 02:57:02.020]  As I mentioned before, we see the rhetoric escalating.
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:09.386]  It was a week ago that Glenn Beck tried to pen the label of a sovereign citizen movement on Mr. Bundy, and that was not what he was saying.
[02:57:09.447 --> 02:57:13.550]  He was saying that the state and local government was sovereign, they should be doing something about this.
[02:57:14.111 --> 02:57:19.115]  Then four days later, three days later, on Thursday, we saw Harry Reid uses the term domestic terrorist.
[02:57:19.215 --> 02:57:21.197]  Clearly a lie, clearly over the top.
[02:57:21.617 --> 02:57:22.818]  Now we've got MSNBC.
[02:57:24.093 --> 02:57:27.114]  Calling the people that were there, calling the Bundys insurgents.
[02:57:27.755 --> 02:57:28.395]  Escalating this.
[02:57:28.795 --> 02:57:32.336]  This is what we saw developing at the Boston bombing last year.
[02:57:32.476 --> 02:57:36.258]  It was the Southern Poverty Law Center that was coming in and pushing on that at the time as well.
[02:57:36.698 --> 02:57:39.019]  Oh, we think this might be some domestic terrorists.
[02:57:39.039 --> 02:57:40.600]  This might be right-wing terrorists.
[02:57:41.340 --> 02:57:42.801]  We started exposing that.
[02:57:42.921 --> 02:57:55.085]  We started looking at crowdsourcing investigations, pictures that we're putting up, showing how they were setting this thing up, and they cancelled their press conferences and went with a different story, using these guys who they'd worked with in the past as patsies.
[02:57:55.125 --> 02:57:56.465]  That's what I firmly believe.
[02:57:56.785 --> 02:57:57.946]  But let's look at what's going on.
[02:57:57.966 --> 02:57:59.406]  Who are the real terrorists here?
[02:57:59.846 --> 02:58:02.527]  What we saw at BLM, I just made a quick list of some of their crimes.
[02:58:02.867 --> 02:58:06.989]  Assault with deadly weapons as they were training snipers on people who were unarmed.
[02:58:07.529 --> 02:58:16.152]  Battery of protesters beating them, armed robbery, grand larceny, denial of civil rights in the free speech areas, impersonating an officer.
[02:58:16.613 --> 02:58:17.933]  That's right, impersonating an officer.
[02:58:17.973 --> 02:58:22.215]  We have Congressman Steve Stockman from Texas who wrote a letter and said, you know what?
[02:58:22.835 --> 02:58:29.558]  When you have to use law enforcement, the law says you shall contract with local law enforcement, not do it yourself.
[02:58:29.758 --> 02:58:31.238]  We're going to be right back in Overdrive.
[02:58:31.278 --> 02:58:31.659]  Stay tuned.
[02:58:31.679 --> 02:58:32.359]  I want to finish this.
[02:58:49.398 --> 02:58:51.179]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:59:07.824 --> 02:59:15.947]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:16.227 --> 02:59:20.930]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:59:35.078 --> 02:59:41.922]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[03:00:13.652 --> 03:00:14.273]  Big Brother.
[03:00:14.953 --> 03:00:15.974]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:16.715 --> 03:00:17.836]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:18.476 --> 03:00:19.277]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.058 --> 03:00:20.958]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:21.599 --> 03:00:25.242]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:25.803 --> 03:00:29.866]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.302 --> 03:00:36.683]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:36.803 --> 03:00:43.767]  I'm David Knight and we're here in Overdrive because I wanted to cover a couple of articles that really show how this is not limited to one rancher.
[03:00:43.807 --> 03:00:46.809]  This is not something that's even necessarily limited to ranchers.
[03:00:46.849 --> 03:00:48.731]  It's certainly not limited to that specific ranch.
[03:00:49.131 --> 03:00:51.052]  Take a look at this story out of North Carolina.
[03:00:51.072 --> 03:00:54.735]  We've got North Carolina fish houses are navigating a variety of issues.
[03:00:54.755 --> 03:00:56.356]  This is a story from Journal Now.
[03:00:57.156 --> 03:01:06.883]  This is a family business of fishermen, LT Everett and Sons, that ceased operation December 31st after 67 years in business.
[03:01:07.444 --> 03:01:08.705]  Why were they put out of business?
[03:01:09.425 --> 03:01:14.829]  Same reason that the ranchers in the Bundy area in Bunkerville were put out of business.
[03:01:14.869 --> 03:01:17.852]  Of course, the Bundy family has been there for 140 years.
[03:01:17.912 --> 03:01:21.715]  Listen to what happened to these fishermen after 67 years in a family business.
[03:01:22.435 --> 03:01:24.598]  Estelle Brothers now, who took over from the father.
[03:01:25.139 --> 03:01:32.948]  He cited a decrease in product due to state and federal regulations that affect many of the fish that they sold, like sea bass, grouper, flounder, red drum.
[03:01:33.289 --> 03:01:38.475]  He said, they cut down the allocations, we just couldn't get enough seafood to keep going.
[03:01:39.116 --> 03:01:50.686]  The regulations intended for the protection of fish stocks vary by species and can be very complex, with harvest quotas, size limits, and times of the year you can fish all being part of the equation.
[03:01:50.726 --> 03:01:53.089]  That was what was happening at the Bundy Ranch.
[03:01:53.129 --> 03:01:57.553]  They came in when they started this and said, we're going to protect these endangered species, the desert tortoise.
[03:01:57.573 --> 03:01:59.915]  What they did was they came in and they cut the allocations by 90%.
[03:02:01.576 --> 03:02:05.361]  Can you keep your business in effect if your business is immediately cut by 90%?
[03:02:05.461 --> 03:02:12.390]  If they cut it by the times of year, taking your cattle off of the land at the peak times, and that's what they're doing to these fishermen here.
[03:02:12.830 --> 03:02:13.511]  They're cutting it down.
[03:02:13.551 --> 03:02:14.893]  And let me explain something to you.
[03:02:14.933 --> 03:02:16.315]  When they put these regulations on,
[03:02:16.775 --> 03:02:21.097]  They're not just putting out family businesses that have been in business for generations.
[03:02:21.577 --> 03:02:30.642]  They're also erecting barriers to make sure that there aren't going to be any new small businesses that are going to be competing with the multinational and international businesses that they're protecting.
[03:02:30.682 --> 03:02:31.602]  Listen to this quote here.
[03:02:32.263 --> 03:02:36.905]  They say that high fuel prices can make it unprofitable for fishermen to run their boats for smaller harvests.
[03:02:36.925 --> 03:02:37.325]  That's right.
[03:02:37.345 --> 03:02:38.486]  They have this overhead cost.
[03:02:38.546 --> 03:02:40.947]  If you cut down the amount of fish that they can get, they can't do that.
[03:02:41.727 --> 03:02:46.350]  And seafood imports compete with seafood caught in the United States.
[03:02:47.050 --> 03:03:01.319]  See, in these international waters where they're going in and fishing and then coming back and selling them in the United States or bringing them in with open free trade agreements, quote-unquote, that they prefer the international companies, they're putting out the small businessman.
[03:03:01.799 --> 03:03:05.622]  They're turning us over to the corporate food production.
[03:03:06.142 --> 03:03:08.544]  And this is something that is not going to come back.
[03:03:09.344 --> 03:03:20.809]  And if you think it's just about businesses and you don't basically like people who have their own business because maybe you extrapolate the sins of the giant corporations to the small businessmen in your neighborhood, this is not just about that.
[03:03:21.209 --> 03:03:22.830]  This is about your food supply.
[03:03:22.850 --> 03:03:24.551]  They're cutting down the fish.
[03:03:24.951 --> 03:03:26.332]  They're cutting down the beef.
[03:03:26.932 --> 03:03:29.314]  The Bundys were raising beef in open range.
[03:03:29.374 --> 03:03:30.014]  That's what you want.
[03:03:30.034 --> 03:03:38.040]  You don't want cattle that's corralled and fed these antibiotics and steroids and everything else that they give them in the factory farms.
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:41.222]  That's the kind of meat that you want to eat if you're going to be eating beef.
[03:03:41.523 --> 03:03:43.104]  But they don't want you eating beef.
[03:03:43.624 --> 03:03:56.097]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, at the same time that you've got the Mockingbird Press trying to, again, demonize these people as right-wing terrorists, the Southern Poverty Law Center is trying to tell you that Agenda 21 is a right-wing conspiracy.
[03:03:56.398 --> 03:03:57.739]  It's not a right-wing conspiracy!
[03:03:58.220 --> 03:04:04.546]  It's been mentioned by, as Kit Daniels pointed out in this article today, and we had an article that we talked about last night on the nightly news from the New American,
[03:04:05.626 --> 03:04:09.029]  They're pointing out that it's not a right-wing conspiracy.
[03:04:09.049 --> 03:04:12.292]  There's been three states where they've introduced anti-Agenda 21 legislation.
[03:04:13.092 --> 03:04:17.356]  In Alabama, it passed unanimously, including all of the Democrats there.
[03:04:17.956 --> 03:04:22.360]  And one of the best books about Agenda 21 is by Rosa Corey, who's a Democrat.
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:24.442]  She's a feminist, a lesbian.
[03:04:24.482 --> 03:04:25.903]  She's always been a Democrat.
[03:04:25.963 --> 03:04:29.085]  But on this issue, she understands what's going on.
[03:04:30.046 --> 03:04:31.887]  And we see what's happening here in Texas.
[03:04:32.167 --> 03:04:33.788]  The same type of situation.
[03:04:34.068 --> 03:04:38.910]  Texas only has one and a half percent of the land controlled by the federal government.
[03:04:39.250 --> 03:04:40.831]  And they're trying to increase that now.
[03:04:41.271 --> 03:04:48.455]  And I don't have time to talk about it, but if you look at this article, you'll see that the BLM, when they confiscated people's lands, they go back to the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.
[03:04:48.575 --> 03:04:55.158]  Glenn Beck criticized Clive Mundy laughing at him because he's going back to 1864 when it became a state.
[03:04:55.258 --> 03:04:56.639]  They will use those arguments.
[03:04:56.679 --> 03:04:57.739]  They are not arcane.
[03:04:57.999 --> 03:04:59.120]  And they really do matter.
[03:04:59.640 --> 03:05:00.842]  In the Conclave Clause.
[03:05:01.322 --> 03:05:02.784]  Well, that's all we've got time for today.
[03:05:02.824 --> 03:05:03.725]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[03:05:03.785 --> 03:05:05.947]  Alex will be back at 11 Central, noon.
[03:05:06.328 --> 03:05:08.090]  And we'll have the Nightly News tonight at 7.
[03:05:08.250 --> 03:05:16.540]  For the past 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
