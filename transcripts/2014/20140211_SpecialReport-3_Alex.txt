[00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.031]  We're outside the Hyperion Waste Treatment Facility.
[00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:16.154]  This is located just a little bit south of the city of Los Angeles.
[00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:22.859]  Now, we've been on our West Coast tour documenting levels of radiation, but we thought we'd take a side trip and educate our viewers about this plant.
[00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:28.103]  Now, in a nutshell, this plant uses human feces to make organic fertilizers.
[00:00:28.123 --> 00:00:31.166]  They use these big mixers called digesters.
[00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:34.769]  They mix it up in there, and then they process it out, they ship it out,
[00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.253]  It's sprinkled on fields, the livestock eat it, you eat the livestock, so basically you're eating human feces.
[00:00:40.653 --> 00:00:42.614]  But that's the side note of this trip.
[00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:50.120]  We were approached by an officer, myself and my cameraman, we were on obviously this side, let's show them the side here, Josh.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.964]  On this side of the street, on the other side of the street is a waste treatment facility, which they're saying that we cannot show.
[00:00:56.664 --> 00:01:04.551]  So, an officer, or should I say, more accurately, a security guard, saw us from across the street, summoned us over to him.
[00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:06.673]  We were trying to be cooperative with the gentleman.
[00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:08.354]  We weren't exactly sure what his beef was.
[00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:12.097]  He says, hey, it's our policy that you can't film here.
[00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:12.658]  And I say, sir,
[00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:13.798]  Do you have a law?
[00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:17.019]  Is it a law here in California that I can't film this facility with my cameraman?
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.480]  He said, no, it's our policy.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.421]  You have to call X, Y, and Z and he'll give you the authorization.
[00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:25.242]  I was approached by a real police officer who told me the same thing.
[00:01:25.262 --> 00:01:30.124]  I asked one of your officers, is this a policy or is this a law that we can't film this facility?
[00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:38.523]  So there's no law, but like I said, based on the fact that it is a critical site, your activity is being deemed suspicious, so we have the authority to stop.
[00:01:38.543 --> 00:01:42.487]  Yeah, I understand why you intercepted us, but I mean, like, is it a law?
[00:01:42.547 --> 00:01:42.988]  Is it a policy?
[00:01:43.048 --> 00:01:46.652]  No, there's no law, because if there was a law, the plant couldn't authorize you.
[00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:55.478]  I said, sir, your security guard summoned me and my cameraman to your side of the street, which we're not supposed to be, which we were completely on the other side of the street.
[00:01:55.518 --> 00:01:57.680]  The security guard brought us over there on that side.
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.924]  And I told the officer he brought us over here, told us we couldn't film, but said it's a policy, not a law.
[00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.285]  The officer confirmed to me.
[00:02:04.673 --> 00:02:06.054]  We're really close to the airport.
[00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:07.275]  We're like a mile away from the airport.
[00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:07.675]  Or so many miles.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.825]  So basically, our First Amendment right is being suppressed here, right outside the Hyperion plant, just a little bit south of Los Angeles.
[00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:33.148]  Your freedom of speech, your freedom of the press is being suppressed here.
[00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:35.970]  They say that they'll give you authorization when they get around to it.
[00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:37.812]  So, that's it.
[00:02:37.832 --> 00:02:38.732]  We'll continue south.
[00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:41.294]  More reports at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:43.464]  And your name is officer?
[00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:44.325]  Sergeant Mayorga.
[00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:45.406]  Mayorga, okay.
[00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:45.927]  And your name is?
[00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:46.808]  Sergeant Lieutenant.
[00:02:46.828 --> 00:02:47.689]  Can I get your name?
[00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.630]  Do you need your information?
[00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.733]  Do you have a business card or anything I can take a look at?
[00:02:50.813 --> 00:02:51.574]  No, I don't, sir.
[00:02:51.654 --> 00:02:54.117]  If you know I'm not authorized to film, I'd just rather go on my way.
[00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:55.058]  Okay, sir.
[00:02:55.278 --> 00:02:55.499]  Alright.
