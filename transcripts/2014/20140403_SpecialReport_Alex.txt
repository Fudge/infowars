[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.603]  Poor ratings may sink Ronan Farrow's new daily show on MSNBC.
[00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:15.687]  Ronan's show drew an average of 312,000 viewers last week.
[00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:19.590]  Pretty dismal for someone pegged to be a major TV personality.
[00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:22.813]  Now it may just be that Ronan's anchored to a sinking ship.
[00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:25.215]  MSNBC is tanking overall.
[00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:29.318]  Losing nearly a quarter of its primetime audience in 2013.
[00:00:29.818 --> 00:00:35.603]  And following a similar loss in 2012, MSNBC has the smallest audience since 2007.
[00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:41.187]  Perhaps Ronan's show is tanking because he was given a primetime show without much training.
[00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:45.591]  Kind of like another actor with poor job performance and dismal approval ratings.
[00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:56.258]  After his candidacy was endorsed by the departing senator in 1996, uncontested and inexperienced Barack Obama rose quickly through the ranks of the Illinois State Senate.
[00:00:56.638 --> 00:01:08.226]  He was then strangely given the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by 9.1 million viewers, even though he didn't have any experience as a US senator.
[00:01:08.246 --> 00:01:11.488]  Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it,
[00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:15.177]  My presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.
[00:01:15.737 --> 00:01:19.759]  Four years later, he was elected President of the United States of America.
[00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.822]  And then nine months after the election, Obama was given the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:28.004]  But back to Ronan Farrow's manufactured celebrity.
[00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:33.887]  The theory was that Farrow would bring his 245,000 Twitter followers with him to television.
[00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:35.388]  But that hasn't happened.
[00:01:35.608 --> 00:01:39.470]  Perhaps it's because his Twitter followers are mostly fake spam bots.
[00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.492]  A quick check from Twitter Audit shows that less than half of Ronan's followers are real.
[00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:46.333]  Maybe that's why they're not watching.
[00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:56.618]  26-year-old Ronan Farrow, who, without ever hardly even having a paying job, was given his own primetime television show practically overnight.
[00:01:57.118 --> 00:02:03.921]  He graduated school at 15, he went to Yale Law School at 16, and then he became a Rhodes Scholar.
[00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:08.003]  Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrook,
[00:02:08.423 --> 00:02:08.824]  I think so.
[00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:39.306]  Ronan was also appointed Hillary Clinton's special advisor for global youth issues.
[00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:48.796]  Farrow's appointment and the creation of the office were announced by Clinton as part of a refocusing on youth following the Arab Spring Revolutions.
[00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:54.902]  And with that, Obama administration insider Ronan Farrow's orchestrated rollout commenced.
[00:02:55.342 --> 00:03:00.143]  He became the youngest host on MSNBC with his own daytime show.
[00:03:00.684 --> 00:03:11.227]  And much like Obama's puzzling Peace Prize, Farrow was awarded an Excellence in Journalism Award a mere 48 hours after he became a journalist.
[00:03:11.827 --> 00:03:17.712]  So is Ronan Farrow just an overachieving boy genius or a well-positioned puppet?
[00:03:18.273 --> 00:03:34.887]  As the Guardian points out, the discussion of Ronan Farrow as future presidential material, a prominent theme in the New York Times profile of the star, makes him seem like a new sort of Manchurian candidate, which is interesting since the star of that movie, Frank Sinatra, is rumored to be Farrow's father.
[00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:44.612]  Rallying a nation of television viewers into hysteria to sweep us up into the White House with powers that will make martial law seem like anarchy.
[00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:48.594]  And you thought he was just Rosemary's baby.
[00:03:49.454 --> 00:03:58.058]  As predicted in an Obama deception in 2009, these Manchurian candidates' sole responsibility is to sell the public on the globalist agenda.
[00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:03.440]  They're called Generation O, and they were the key to Barack Obama's White House win.
[00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.995]  During the campaign, Barack Obama used the internet like no other candidate before him, harnessing the energy of millions of his supporters.
[00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:16.520]  But the question now is, what to do with this young, eager, energetic army?
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.561]  Oh my God!
[00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:20.104]  This is the best day of my life!
[00:04:20.144 --> 00:04:23.628]  It was the scope of Obama's victory that was most impressive.
[00:04:24.426 --> 00:04:28.668]  In summation, Barack Obama is a Madison Avenue created fad.
[00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:39.354]  All of the crazed Obama worship being pushed by the corporate media is scientifically designed to capture the public in a net of peer pressure mass euphoria.
[00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:49.840]  If the New World Order can just distract the public for a few more years, the elite can finish constructing their police state control grid.
[00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.573]  And now the globalist left is laying the foundation for yet another manufactured Madison Avenue creation.
[00:04:57.013 --> 00:05:07.419]  He's primed for political office, he can read from a teleprompter, and he is ready to take the globalist agenda to the next signpost whenever he's called into the political spotlight.
