[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.611]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:09.837]  Big Brother.
[00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:11.538]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.359]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.840]  You want answers?
[00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:16.502]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:20.805]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:25.409]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:42.903]  Well, Hillary Clinton has now compared Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler.
[00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:50.068]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has just come out and offers a grim outlook on nation's defense.
[00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:51.910]  That's Adam McClatchy.
[00:00:53.351 --> 00:01:02.819]  We just saw hearings this morning, we've got clips of, where Lois Lerner, who's been caught lying and taken the fifth previously, but then went on to give testimony.
[00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:07.479]  As if her lies were protected by her declaring the Fifth.
[00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.261]  The Fifth was the right to remain silent, not to perjure herself.
[00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:18.524]  Well, now she has been questioned again and taken the Fifth, and it was quite a circus.
[00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:22.646]  So we're going to be leading up with that when we start the next segment coming up.
[00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:28.449]  Issa says contempt citation against Lerner, quote, has to be considered.
[00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.310]  Now we're talking.
[00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.652]  Let's see the contempt citation.
[00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:33.432]  What about perjury?
[00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:37.056]  Was it early last year she got up there?
[00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:38.056]  It was about a year ago.
[00:01:39.377 --> 00:01:45.602]  We played the clips and maybe we should dig those back up where she said, I take the fifth, but went on to say she knew nothing about what was going on the target of the Tea Party.
[00:01:46.103 --> 00:01:48.424]  Now it's all come out that they did and it was ordered.
[00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:51.227]  So she's protecting El Presidente.
[00:01:52.768 --> 00:02:00.434]  And Issa walks out of the IRS scandal hearing as Cummings calls proceedings at American because his microphone got cut off and he wanted to continue asking questions.
[00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:12.357]  So this is a real three-ring circus, and this could bring down the Obamanites, because they are certainly persecuting people.
[00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:17.221]  Daryl Issa angrily adjourns oversight hearing after Lois Lerner pleads the fifth.
[00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:19.723]  Again, we've got that video coming up.
[00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:25.026]  But, tune in to MSNBC, or read Democrat-controlled newspapers.
[00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:29.950]  They're like, hey, we don't need libertarian or conservative groups having free speech.
[00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:42.249]  We don't need them to be able to have 501c3 or 501c3 for all the different tax exempt designations because that gives them political power.
[00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:43.870]  Only we're allowed to have that.
[00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.912]  So it's a real form of discrimination and we have the article from yesterday.
[00:02:47.932 --> 00:02:51.414]  In fact, guys, we pulled that out of yesterday's stack because that broke at the end of the show.
[00:02:51.835 --> 00:02:56.077]  It ties into all this and the special video report is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:02:56.917 --> 00:02:58.919]  We have Bloomberg
[00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:08.617]  And others in anti-gun websites saying, don't worry, we're very close to getting Facebook to not let you have pro-gun comments.
[00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:10.959]  You can say, well, Facebook's their own website.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.646]  Yeah, but they operate as a public commons where you go post your stuff, your data, and now they're changing the rules and really violating people's free speech.
[00:03:20.346 --> 00:03:25.971]  Because they use computers to block you with prior restraint.
[00:03:28.663 --> 00:03:38.286]  From being able to post a meme about Benghazi being an inside job, or to send out a meme promoting the Second Amendment, or... They already are doing that to a great extent.
[00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:40.267]  People say, well, why are you on Facebook then?
[00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.887]  Because it's the big public comments.
[00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:42.927]  Why am I on YouTube?
[00:03:43.387 --> 00:03:44.568]  That's where the people are.
[00:03:44.988 --> 00:03:47.669]  I'm not going to be denied reaching out to folks.
[00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.711]  They opened Facebook to be free and open and not spying on you, and then the head of it said, oh, my users, trust me, they're dumb effers.
[00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:59.685]  We're in their system, in their face, in an info war.
[00:04:00.286 --> 00:04:03.887]  They want to have the big platforms, but then be able to restrict speech on them.
[00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:08.189]  And by the way, YouTube and Google have been pro-free speech compared to Facebook.
[00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:13.791]  I just want to, comparing apples and oranges, you look at the long trail of activity.
[00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:17.833]  Facebook has been a censor command base.
[00:04:19.054 --> 00:04:20.475]  And it's outrageous.
[00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:27.820]  And we have, I don't know, more than 30 Facebooks that a fan made for us about four years ago that they gave to us about two years ago.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.062]  And one of them's got almost 800,000 viewers or likes.
[00:04:31.102 --> 00:04:33.523]  But if you add them all together, it's about 3 million people following us.
[00:04:33.563 --> 00:04:41.188]  So we're not just going to trash that and then not use that conduit into the Matrix to reach the general public.
[00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.062]  But people better appreciate the fact we've got a Twitter account.
[00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:47.685]  They better appreciate the fact we've got these Facebook accounts.
[00:04:48.065 --> 00:04:51.629]  We have Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.453]  I have a lot of different websites and stuff because I'm so used to being censored.
[00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.074]  Hacked, blocked, you name it.
[00:04:56.795 --> 00:05:00.440]  I've gone out and created a bunch of alternative systems to show that we have redundancy.
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.681]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:02.141]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:05.125]  The facts are in.
[00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:06.445]  The studies are legion.
[00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:14.090]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.692]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:05:18.052 --> 00:05:18.473]  Simple.
[00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:23.035]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:28.799]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:34.403]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:05:34.603 --> 00:05:45.111]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:49.634]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.795]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:05:52.136 --> 00:05:55.338]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations

[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:13.242]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:21.404]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:26.408]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:06:26.588 --> 00:06:33.313]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:40.458]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:06:40.558 --> 00:06:47.423]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:51.928]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.422]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:07.745]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:10.106]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:07:10.287 --> 00:07:18.572]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:29.078]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:07:29.418 --> 00:07:30.358]  We're good to go.
[00:07:50.765 --> 00:07:58.192]  We are offering 15% off Supermail Vitality at Infowarslife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[00:08:20.253 --> 00:08:26.258]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:26.498 --> 00:08:31.602]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.622 --> 00:08:33.243]  Isso walks out of IRS hearings.
[00:08:33.283 --> 00:08:34.905]  Lois Lerner refuses to testify.
[00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:43.431]  Risk arrest on contempt charges in the case of the IRS persecuting anyone right of
[00:08:44.687 --> 00:08:51.429]  I thought I was going to say Baphomet or Mephistopheles, but basically Vladimir Lenin or Mao Tse Tung.
[00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:54.369]  We're going to be breaking that down coming up.
[00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.950]  Also the latest developments in the Ukraine.
[00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:04.512]  Hillary Clinton has called Vladimir Putin Adolf Hitler and Russia has test fired an ICBM amid tension over Ukraine.
[00:09:04.852 --> 00:09:11.794]  The IDF, that's the Israeli Defense Forces, has intercepted a major Iranian weapons shipment to Gaza.
[00:09:12.854 --> 00:09:16.276]  Restaurants across the country are moving to block Google Glasses.
[00:09:16.336 --> 00:09:19.077]  I'll talk about why I think that is so important.
[00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:26.141]  And also, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is saying the outlook for the nation's defense is grim.
[00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:29.242]  All of that and more is coming up today.
[00:09:29.522 --> 00:09:33.644]  Here's a story that broke at the end of yesterday's broadcast.
[00:09:33.664 --> 00:09:36.266]  It's going to tie into a new story up on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:38.307]  Bloomberg moves to ban
[00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:42.269]  Pro-gun speech, and that ties into what the IRS is up to.
[00:09:42.289 --> 00:09:43.470]  I'm going to explain that in a moment.
[00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:50.114]  Facebook now working with former New York Mayor to censor support for the Second Amendment.
[00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:56.979]  And then continuing, Maryland to target 110,000 citizens with gun confiscation.
[00:09:57.399 --> 00:10:01.202]  New law would link gun registry with criminal database.
[00:10:01.222 --> 00:10:07.225]  We're going to be breaking both of those down as well coming up here today.
[00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:10.988]  Plus, you may not be able to get guacamole according to Chipotle.
[00:10:11.369 --> 00:10:16.913]  Climate change is so devastating that they say you may not be able to get even your salsa in the future.
[00:10:17.273 --> 00:10:18.654]  Tomatoes won't be able to be grown.
[00:10:19.335 --> 00:10:23.138]  This is like saying we'll all be dead if you don't pay Al Gore money, which is actually what they're doing.
[00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.119]  Doesn't matter the Great Lakes have frozen.
[00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:27.001]  Doesn't matter the Niagara Falls is frozen.
[00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:30.944]  The Great Lakes have never been documented in 400 years to totally freeze.
[00:10:31.004 --> 00:10:31.564]  It's now happened.
[00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:34.426]  But they say we're in the middle of a heat spell and
[00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:41.353]  Again, they're just running around like chickens with their heads cut off, fear-mongering to try to push the societal takeover.
[00:10:41.813 --> 00:10:47.937]  We're going to be breaking all of that down here today in some huge developments in Kiev.
[00:10:49.338 --> 00:10:50.278]  Leaked phone call.
[00:10:50.298 --> 00:10:51.799]  We're going to be playing this coming up.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.783]  Kiev snipers hired by U.S.-backed opposition to shoot people.
[00:10:57.799 --> 00:10:59.399]  To then claim that the police were doing it.
[00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.600]  Called a false flag, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:09.381]  And you know that last tape of the ambassador and her deputy talking about destabilizing the country and effing the EU and the Russians?
[00:11:09.842 --> 00:11:11.202]  That's confirmed to be a real tape now.
[00:11:12.022 --> 00:11:16.463]  So, that's how they roll and that's how they operate.
[00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:21.004]  And Russian spies are intercepting the telecommunications.
[00:11:21.724 --> 00:11:24.049]  That's why they're being disrupted all over the Ukraine right now.
[00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:29.382]  Because intercepting them will disrupt them if you do it right out of the air a lot of times.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.442]  The systems that basically jam the communications while sucking them up.
[00:11:34.963 --> 00:11:49.012]  That's why so much of our technology doesn't work well, because the back doors in everything are screwing up the operating systems and the hardware, the chips themselves, because so much of it is about the back door, so much of it is about the Trojan horses.
[00:11:49.552 --> 00:11:52.274]  Before I get into our top story of the IRS meltdown,
[00:11:53.493 --> 00:11:59.437]  Program note here, because a lot of folks were excited about me coming to England and I'm still invited to speak at Oxford.
[00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:01.298]  I'm not snubbing Oxford.
[00:12:01.659 --> 00:12:11.325]  They wanted me to give their keynote, end of winter address officially to the school in closed session for only members of the university and faculty.
[00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:16.209]  It is an honor, one of the best honors you can get speaking to a university.
[00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:17.230]  I'm not going.
[00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.391]  Because I got too much stuff going on here with the operation.
[00:12:21.811 --> 00:12:31.274]  Trying to redesign InfoWars.com, PrisonBlooded.com, trying to launch the TV system, family stuff, family illnesses, all sorts of things going on.
[00:12:31.294 --> 00:12:33.494]  I'm just not going to England.
[00:12:33.955 --> 00:12:36.095]  So I cancelled that officially with them yesterday.
[00:12:36.675 --> 00:12:39.836]  But I do intend to go there in the summer next year if they want me.
[00:12:39.876 --> 00:12:40.216]  That's fine.
[00:12:40.236 --> 00:12:40.997]  They say they still do.
[00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:42.517]  But that's just a side note.
[00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:45.518]  I will be in here next week live in studio.
[00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:49.281]  I just, I'm not gonna miss my radio show for four days.
[00:12:50.242 --> 00:12:55.167]  All this stuff's happening in Ukraine and with the dollar and all the rest of it.
[00:12:55.187 --> 00:13:01.233]  It's just, it's not a big enough bang for the buck to go speak to a couple thousand people.
[00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:10.932]  We're not going to be speaking to millions every day and producing all sorts of important investigative reports and reaching millions more.
[00:13:11.452 --> 00:13:16.517]  It's a low-tech, ancient thing, and I know it's honorable to go and speak to a group.
[00:13:17.758 --> 00:13:22.743]  And I think the camels, what broke the camels back, the straw was,
[00:13:24.144 --> 00:13:24.865]  It's always the same.
[00:13:24.925 --> 00:13:27.869]  I said, yeah, I'll go speak, but I got to be able to film it and use it however I want.
[00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:28.490]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:32.656]  Well, actually, the union wants to film it themselves and then you can have the tape.
[00:13:32.857 --> 00:13:33.718]  Oh, can I use it?
[00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:34.780]  Well, maybe.
[00:13:36.175 --> 00:13:40.717]  And I guess they just thought I would just keep coming because they were paying me to come there.
[00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:42.098]  No, that was from the beginning.
[00:13:42.398 --> 00:13:53.164]  It's like, see, I could go give a good speech that was going to be a powerful speech on the future of humanity and the paradigm shift for two hours, and then I could give it to everybody and air it on the show.
[00:13:53.504 --> 00:13:54.985]  I was going to simulcast it on the show.
[00:13:55.025 --> 00:14:01.769]  In fact, I'd be speaking during the second hour of the show, the third hour, we're going to carry it on the radio.
[00:14:02.369 --> 00:14:05.091]  I was bringing a crew that they weren't paying for to come.
[00:14:06.076 --> 00:14:11.258]  And, you know, the cost of like $15,000 probably, with all the plane tickets and the rest of it, because they weren't paying for that part.
[00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:16.139]  And it's just like, there's no point to just go behind closed doors and talk to people.
[00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:16.720]  I'm not doing it.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.020]  Not doing it.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.102]  So I could go there, take the archaic, speaking in Oxford, which is important.
[00:14:23.642 --> 00:14:26.383]  I like archaic stuff, and I like person-to-person stuff.
[00:14:26.403 --> 00:14:26.963]  I think it's great.
[00:14:27.223 --> 00:14:29.724]  But I could then take it and digitize it, put it out to everybody.
[00:14:29.764 --> 00:14:33.145]  But I'm just not going to do that if I can't do that.
[00:14:34.786 --> 00:14:35.366]  What great
[00:14:37.466 --> 00:14:37.826]  I don't know.
[00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.282]  Kingsnake or something.
[00:14:57.302 --> 00:15:01.886]  They just keep begging for a snake, my son especially, but that has now spread to the other ones.
[00:15:02.066 --> 00:15:04.288]  And I mean, I just hold the line on reptiles.
[00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:05.730]  Nothing against them.
[00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.273]  I'm just not a big snake person and really don't want to feed it baby mice either.
[00:15:09.293 --> 00:15:15.659]  And they just are very excited and believe that I've agreed to a snake, which I really haven't agreed.
[00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:20.243]  But it's kind of like kids get this thing where, yes, no, you have, and we're getting the snake this weekend.
[00:15:22.418 --> 00:15:29.000]  But it's kind of the ultimate system of advertising, where you just convince everyone, yes, it is happening.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.861]  And so it ends up happening.
[00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:37.642]  But listen, if you won't get me a king snake, I know you'll at least get me a small boa.
[00:15:38.682 --> 00:15:40.743]  Which we can then go to the Florida Everglades and dump out.
[00:15:41.448 --> 00:15:42.869]  No, no, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.193]  But we will put Cayman Alligators in Barton Creek.
[00:15:48.054 --> 00:15:49.315]  I am seriously thinking about it.
[00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:49.876]  I'm joking.
[00:15:50.477 --> 00:15:50.917]  I'm joking.
[00:15:50.977 --> 00:15:51.838]  Actually, I'm not joking.
[00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:53.780]  It has been looked at.
[00:15:54.721 --> 00:15:58.184]  Anyways, we're worried if we have a pond by Barton Creek.
[00:15:58.783 --> 00:16:06.527]  And then what will happen if the alligators in a heated pond get out of the pond, the Koi pond, and then go down to the creek?
[00:16:06.927 --> 00:16:07.668]  Could that happen?
[00:16:08.408 --> 00:16:09.148]  Is the question.
[00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:12.390]  Alright, I am really all over the map and I apologize, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:13.451 --> 00:16:16.993]  I am now segwaying off into other issues here.
[00:16:17.073 --> 00:16:17.933]  Let's get serious.
[00:16:19.754 --> 00:16:23.076]  If tyrants can set the precedent
[00:16:24.369 --> 00:16:30.178]  To do things that were previously illegal and get away with it, it sets the precedent that they're basically above the law.
[00:16:30.378 --> 00:16:33.363]  That's a very simple maxim in law and common sense.
[00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:36.992]  Give them an inch, they take you a mile.
[00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.053]  They take you a mile, they take you a thousand miles.
[00:16:39.393 --> 00:16:41.415]  They take you a thousand miles, they take you a trillion miles.
[00:16:42.075 --> 00:16:51.261]  And so we've gotten into this situation where government and the interests that control it are really running around like wild heathen, like pirates on the deck of a ship.
[00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:55.624]  They've just captured guzzling rum and pilfering wenches.
[00:16:59.212 --> 00:17:06.458]  This spectacle is intensifying in its rapidity, and in its frequency, and its intensity.
[00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:20.610]  And we've got Issa, who's done a decent job on Fast and Furious, a decent job on this, but he always stops with contempt, or always stops and doesn't go with congressional impeachment hearings.
[00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:28.296]  He goes, you can impeach Lois Lerner, you can impeach the Attorney General, you can impeach Obama, you can impeach any of these people.
[00:17:30.987 --> 00:17:34.449]  But the Democrats will bring out all the dirt on the Republicans if they do.
[00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:38.192]  The problem is that the Democrats are doing that anyways.
[00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:43.136]  Oh look, you have a crooked toenail, or you had a girlfriend on the side ten years ago.
[00:17:43.976 --> 00:17:52.102]  It's all going to come out, or it's all going to be exaggerated, or it's all going to be manufactured, and they're going for a full takeover to get rid of the other party.
[00:17:52.122 --> 00:17:56.245]  I mean, you think we're bad enough with two parties in this country that are joined at the hip, conjoined.
[00:17:57.126 --> 00:17:58.847]  Now we've got
[00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:14.088]  The one party system trying to kill what's left of the Republicans and the Republican leadership selling out in the final moment to try to get a place at the table in the transition and get some more personal loot and goodies for themselves.
[00:18:14.189 --> 00:18:28.599]  But you've got Richard Nixon with 100 names or 110 names, whatever it was, locked up in that safe that he had the IRS commissioner gather of his political enemies to try to leak it to the media and use it against people.
[00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:33.483]  Now you've got everybody's IRS file being shared by all these agencies illegally.
[00:18:34.183 --> 00:18:35.563]  They're persecuting people.
[00:18:35.583 --> 00:18:36.463]  They're targeting them.
[00:18:36.503 --> 00:18:37.384]  They're auditing them.
[00:18:37.704 --> 00:18:39.344]  They're going after the non-profits.
[00:18:39.364 --> 00:18:40.924]  They're going after the pro-life cribs.
[00:18:41.344 --> 00:18:44.905]  The Tea Party cribs are telling the military, uh, don't be part of it.
[00:18:46.065 --> 00:18:50.986]  Uh, they're telling, um, you know, everybody that basically freedom's illegal.
[00:18:51.447 --> 00:18:52.927]  They're acting like guns are illegal.
[00:18:54.482 --> 00:18:59.247]  They're trying to create social pressure, like political correctness, so everybody goes along with this.
[00:19:00.508 --> 00:19:12.581]  And then you get Lois Lerner, the IRS head over the non-profits, who now came out last year, did perjure herself, even though she took the fifth, she went on to lie after it, as if that was a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:13.782]  Now, the fifth means you shut up.
[00:19:15.307 --> 00:19:23.173]  And so she's been caught lying, and it goes to the Attorney General, it goes to Obama, the IRS person under her met with Obama over and over again, Obama got caught lying about that.
[00:19:23.573 --> 00:19:28.477]  So all this comes out, and she pleads the fifth this time, and they shut it down.
[00:19:29.477 --> 00:19:39.505]  And even though the hearing's being shut down because she won't talk, you get the other Congressperson, Cummings, who says, this is an American, I want to ask questions, and they turn his mic off.
[00:19:40.005 --> 00:19:40.806]  That's coming up.
[00:19:41.486 --> 00:19:43.508]  But these people are not invincible.
[00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:45.880]  Look at that look of that woman.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.942]  I mean, literally a political persecutor.
[00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:51.564]  Like something out of North Korea or something.
[00:19:51.584 --> 00:19:54.466]  I'm looking at an image of her if you're a TV viewer, if you're a radio listener.
[00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.529]  PrisonPlanet.tv, we have video simulcasts going right now.
[00:19:58.209 --> 00:20:04.374]  And it is just so frustrating to see them getting away with things that are a thousand times what Nixon did conservatively.
[00:20:04.854 --> 00:20:12.758]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.
[00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:16.781]  Stay one step ahead of hackers and Big Brother with a BlockIt Pocket.
[00:20:17.081 --> 00:20:22.444]  A custom-made pocket infused with pure silver that creates a complete Faraday enclosure for your cell phone.

[00:20:27.146 --> 00:20:28.047]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.133]  The ultimate survival, bug-out, lightweight fishing pole is M-Rod.
[00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:46.398]  Made by a family-owned American company and assembled in Idaho, M-Rod fishing gear comes with a lifetime warranty and 90-day money-back guarantee.
[00:20:46.659 --> 00:20:49.741]  M-Rod weighs just 8 ounces and breaks down to 14 inches.
[00:20:50.101 --> 00:20:54.944]  M-Rod's indestructible stainless steel compact design makes it perfect to take anywhere.

[00:20:57.486 --> 00:20:59.928]  That's E-M-M-R-O-D.com.
[00:21:00.188 --> 00:21:00.708]  M-Rod.
[00:21:00.828 --> 00:21:01.849]  Fish to survive.
[00:21:02.089 --> 00:21:03.230]  Survive to fish.
[00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.693]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives Ed a peace of mind.
[00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:11.955]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[00:21:12.335 --> 00:21:18.359]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:30.386]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:35.069]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:36.870]  And they're so easy to use.
[00:21:37.071 --> 00:21:38.992]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[00:21:39.012 --> 00:21:42.735]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[00:21:42.995 --> 00:21:46.157]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.
[00:21:46.557 --> 00:21:49.519]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.

[00:21:54.383 --> 00:21:55.345]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[00:22:03.524 --> 00:22:08.048]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:09.729]  But not all silver is equal.
[00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:18.295]  Supernatural silver is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver.
[00:22:18.656 --> 00:22:25.060]  Supernatural silver resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses.
[00:22:25.441 --> 00:22:29.564]  Supernatural silver is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance
[00:22:29.764 --> 00:22:33.705]  and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[00:22:34.185 --> 00:22:40.747]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is highly effective against bacterias, viruses, molds and yeast.
[00:22:41.347 --> 00:22:49.069]  Supernatural Silver liquid and gel are perfect for on-the-go or emergency preparedness and can provide protection at home, school or work.

[00:23:02.992 --> 00:23:05.573]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:05.833 --> 00:23:10.694]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:23:10.954 --> 00:23:18.776]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:19.076 --> 00:23:23.400]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.443]  Bipatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:27.583 --> 00:23:33.287]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:33.528 --> 00:23:36.250]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:41.911]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:50.173]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:23.206]  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps dragging on.
[00:24:24.146 --> 00:24:30.608]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to this Wednesday worldwide transmission.
[00:24:31.148 --> 00:24:33.548]  Already the fifth day, can you believe it, of March 2014.
[00:24:37.887 --> 00:24:49.978]  Coming up, Stefan Molyneux is going to be in studio with us to talk about the state of the world and what's going to happen as those that follow the statist religion find out that it was all a cult and they were betrayed.
[00:24:49.998 --> 00:24:52.581]  You're already starting to see that coming of age happening.
[00:24:53.221 --> 00:24:57.585]  We're going to get his futurist worldview coming up in studio in the second hour.
[00:24:57.625 --> 00:25:00.788]  We'll continue with Open Phones into the third hour today.
[00:25:00.828 --> 00:25:02.089]  We have Ben Swan in studio.
[00:25:04.167 --> 00:25:09.428]  Edward R. Murrow winner, real journalist, trailblazing alternative media individual.
[00:25:09.969 --> 00:25:12.629]  He'll be in studio with us for an hour tomorrow as well.
[00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:20.872]  And the Green Beret doctor, Dr. Edward Group, will also be in studio with us as well.
[00:25:20.892 --> 00:25:22.452]  What are you laughing about over there?
[00:25:22.672 --> 00:25:24.573]  Let's get serious though, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:25.373 --> 00:25:29.814]  Here is part of the hearing today when Lois Lerner, the persecutor,
[00:25:31.483 --> 00:25:32.943]  Sending the IRS after people.
[00:25:32.983 --> 00:25:33.844]  People getting audited.
[00:25:33.884 --> 00:25:35.084]  People having their houses taken.
[00:25:35.444 --> 00:25:36.364]  People being arrested.
[00:25:36.424 --> 00:25:37.364]  People being tried.
[00:25:38.165 --> 00:25:41.745]  A true witch gets up there and takes the fifth yet again.
[00:25:42.405 --> 00:25:43.486]  Caught lying last time.
[00:25:43.886 --> 00:25:46.406]  He's talking about now having her arrested for contempt.
[00:25:46.706 --> 00:25:47.827]  How about for perjury?
[00:25:48.167 --> 00:25:51.808]  Here is her taking the fifth and then the mic's getting turned off and the rest of it.
[00:25:51.848 --> 00:25:52.188]  Here it is.
[00:25:52.448 --> 00:25:53.488]  In order to testify.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:26:00.342]  On the advice of my counsel, I respectfully exercise my Fifth Amendment right and decline to answer that question.
[00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:02.443]  Self-incrimination.
[00:26:05.744 --> 00:26:08.926]  By the way, the IRS doesn't give you that whenever they come after you.
[00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:09.646]  They say no fifth.
[00:26:09.666 --> 00:26:13.067]  Because they are a group of monsters.
[00:26:14.168 --> 00:26:14.788]  Monsters.
[00:26:16.428 --> 00:26:20.672]  Ladies and gentlemen, seeking the truth is the obligation of this committee.
[00:26:21.373 --> 00:26:23.915]  I can see no point in going further.
[00:26:24.396 --> 00:26:25.977]  I have no expectation that Ms.
[00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:31.542]  Lerner will cooperate with this committee, and therefore we... Chairman, Chairman, Chairman, I have a statement.
[00:26:31.562 --> 00:26:34.405]  I have a procedural question, Mr. Chairman.
[00:26:35.986 --> 00:26:37.928]  Mr. Chairman, I have a procedural question.
[00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:44.360]  Mr. Chairman, you cannot run a committee like this.
[00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:46.561]  You just cannot do this.
[00:26:47.562 --> 00:26:49.363]  This is, we're better than that as a country.
[00:26:49.843 --> 00:26:51.083]  We're better than that as a committee.
[00:26:51.103 --> 00:26:56.406]  Yeah, let her take the fifth and then lie after it like she's allowed to.
[00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:57.946]  The fifth means you get to lie.
[00:26:57.966 --> 00:26:59.047]  Now they turn his mic off.
[00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:05.590]  So his mic's being turned on and off.
[00:27:08.271 --> 00:27:09.392]  He says it's un-American.
[00:27:09.412 --> 00:27:10.072]  What's the big deal?
[00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.170]  May I ask my question?
[00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.391]  May I state my statement?
[00:27:15.531 --> 00:27:16.631]  You're all free to leave.
[00:27:16.671 --> 00:27:18.672]  We've adjourned, but the gentleman may ask his question.
[00:27:18.772 --> 00:27:19.492]  Thank you very much.
[00:27:20.813 --> 00:27:22.793]  Mr. Chairman, I have one procedural question.
[00:27:23.653 --> 00:27:27.255]  And it goes to trying to help you get the information, by the way, that you just asked.
[00:27:27.675 --> 00:27:28.995]  What is your question?
[00:27:29.135 --> 00:27:30.816]  No, let me say what I have to say.
[00:27:30.876 --> 00:27:33.316]  I've listened to you for the last 15 or 20 minutes.
[00:27:33.376 --> 00:27:34.477]  Let me say what I have to say.
[00:27:35.635 --> 00:27:37.236]  Sharon, I have one procedural question.
[00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:37.376]  Ms.
[00:27:37.596 --> 00:27:39.298]  Lerner, you're released, you may.
[00:27:39.638 --> 00:27:43.400]  But first, I would like to use my time to make some brief points.
[00:27:44.301 --> 00:27:50.545]  For the past year, the central Republican accusation in this investigation... We're adjourned.
[00:27:50.845 --> 00:27:51.406]  Close it down.
[00:27:52.026 --> 00:27:53.947]  By the way, the meeting is adjourned.
[00:27:54.288 --> 00:27:55.889]  Cummings can go talk to the press out there.
[00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:57.750]  He is violating the House rules.
[00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.292]  Right there, just... Running the committee, not the chairman.
[00:28:02.443 --> 00:28:05.285]  No way Cummings would let Issa do that if he was chairman.
[00:28:05.345 --> 00:28:16.972]  This is unheard of right here.
[00:28:17.012 --> 00:28:18.934]  He's saying it's a lie, the IRS never did anything.
[00:28:19.234 --> 00:28:20.995]  That's right, Obama never did anything.
[00:28:21.235 --> 00:28:23.937]  He just had other people do it to him.
[00:28:23.977 --> 00:28:26.479]  That's right, you never did nothing to anybody in your whole life.
[00:28:26.839 --> 00:28:28.260]  You're all a bunch of sweetie pies.
[00:28:30.489 --> 00:28:32.489]  You're tired of the filmmakers getting arrested?
[00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.690]  And all the persecution?
[00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.651]  You cannot just have a one-sided investigation.
[00:28:39.711 --> 00:28:44.191]  There is absolutely something wrong with that.
[00:28:44.211 --> 00:28:45.932]  A one-sided investigation.
[00:28:46.552 --> 00:28:47.232]  Solyndra.
[00:28:48.812 --> 00:28:49.372]  Solyndra.
[00:28:49.953 --> 00:28:50.773]  Potato patata.
[00:28:51.753 --> 00:28:52.373]  Benghazi.
[00:28:53.073 --> 00:28:54.333]  Well, those guys really hate each other.
[00:28:54.693 --> 00:28:56.214]  I gave you an opportunity to ask a question.
[00:28:56.274 --> 00:28:57.214]  Do you have a question?
[00:28:57.234 --> 00:28:57.914]  I do have a question.
[00:28:58.891 --> 00:29:00.053]  Yeah, he doesn't have any questions.
[00:29:00.093 --> 00:29:01.696]  That means he's up there just ranting.
[00:29:03.038 --> 00:29:06.123]  Calling it un-American that this woman persecutes people.
[00:29:06.984 --> 00:29:07.966]  And she takes the fifth.
[00:29:12.449 --> 00:29:13.390]  I mean, it is incredible.
[00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:17.653]  On MSNBC, they say, good, audit all the Republicans, good, arrest them, good.
[00:29:17.693 --> 00:29:21.976]  Bloomberg's running around trying to get pro-gun speech banned on Facebook.
[00:29:22.297 --> 00:29:25.039]  Most banks won't take a gun shop's account now.
[00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:26.860]  Newspapers won't take our ads.
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.163]  We're all being persecuted by a criminal takeover group.
[00:29:30.363 --> 00:29:33.445]  And they're scared to death we're going to take control of the Republican Party.
[00:29:33.885 --> 00:29:40.170]  Because we're so close to doing it, and you scallywags, scumbag, thug, gangster crooks are scared of it.
[00:29:40.691 --> 00:29:42.112]  Now we come back, we're going to look at
[00:29:43.979 --> 00:29:48.601]  The West, NATO, funding snipers in false flags in Ukraine.
[00:29:48.921 --> 00:29:51.422]  The leaked audio, coming up straight ahead.
[00:29:51.502 --> 00:29:52.383]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:53.683 --> 00:29:56.684]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:57.605 --> 00:30:00.306]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.326 --> 00:30:14.693]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:16.874]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:30:17.074 --> 00:30:17.755]  Fluoride!
[00:30:17.955 --> 00:30:19.536]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:19.876 --> 00:30:26.201]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:30:26.461 --> 00:30:31.244]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:30:31.384 --> 00:30:34.086]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[00:30:34.406 --> 00:30:34.926]  We're good.
[00:31:03.823 --> 00:31:05.824]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:31:06.084 --> 00:31:09.586]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:31:09.726 --> 00:31:14.129]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:31:14.289 --> 00:31:20.253]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:31:20.373 --> 00:31:31.160]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.664]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:31:37.844 --> 00:31:54.856]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia, and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:31:55.176 --> 00:31:59.539]  Get your ProPure with the new Pro1 filters today at infowarestore.com.
[00:32:00.579 --> 00:32:06.400]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:11.521]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:32:11.782 --> 00:32:19.663]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:32:19.903 --> 00:32:24.204]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:32:24.424 --> 00:32:28.245]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:32:28.385 --> 00:32:34.109]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:32:34.349 --> 00:32:37.130]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:42.754]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:51.019]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:51.519]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:32:57.603 --> 00:32:59.952]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[00:33:00.233 --> 00:33:02.904]  MyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[00:33:03.954 --> 00:33:05.535]  Do you know why that was not done?
[00:33:06.535 --> 00:33:08.436]  There are exceptions to that rule.
[00:33:08.797 --> 00:33:09.917]  I do not know, however.
[00:33:09.937 --> 00:33:12.158]  Again, Mr. Chairman, I don't know.
[00:33:13.139 --> 00:33:13.559]  I don't know.
[00:33:14.239 --> 00:33:15.300]  I don't know.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.200]  I don't know.
[00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:16.861]  I don't know.
[00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:17.601]  I don't know.
[00:33:18.221 --> 00:33:19.102]  I don't know.
[00:33:19.782 --> 00:33:20.463]  That I don't know.
[00:33:20.603 --> 00:33:21.323]  I just don't know.
[00:33:21.343 --> 00:33:24.004]  I don't know whether or not... I just don't know.
[00:33:24.064 --> 00:33:26.406]  I don't know exactly how IRS has constructed it.
[00:33:27.646 --> 00:33:28.907]  I don't know when the subpoena was issued.
[00:33:29.565 --> 00:33:30.766]  Well, I don't know precisely.
[00:33:31.386 --> 00:33:31.946]  I don't know.
[00:33:32.346 --> 00:33:32.827]  I don't know.
[00:33:32.847 --> 00:33:35.548]  I don't know the specific questions.
[00:33:35.728 --> 00:33:36.869]  Again, I don't know what happened.
[00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:38.329]  Well, either you know or you don't know.
[00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:38.809]  I don't know.
[00:33:38.829 --> 00:33:39.310]  I don't know.
[00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.650]  I don't know.
[00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:42.351]  I don't know.
[00:33:42.371 --> 00:33:43.552]  I just don't know when.
[00:33:43.592 --> 00:33:43.912]  I don't know.
[00:33:45.447 --> 00:33:47.969]  I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
[00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:48.390]  I'm sorry.
[00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.651]  I did not know.
[00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:51.633]  I don't know what you are going to ask me.
[00:33:51.793 --> 00:33:52.333]  I didn't know.
[00:33:52.353 --> 00:33:55.396]  I technically, I don't know.
[00:33:55.696 --> 00:33:56.096]  I don't know.
[00:33:56.437 --> 00:33:56.877]  I don't think.
[00:33:57.378 --> 00:33:58.799]  I don't think.
[00:33:58.899 --> 00:34:02.702]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.581]  That's right, folks.
[00:34:07.621 --> 00:34:15.051]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's yours truly, Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:34:15.892 --> 00:34:21.279]  And by the way, we're going to have South by Southwest coverage, one of the biggest interactive festivals in the world.
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:31.428]  For the next two weeks, as it kicks off here very, very soon next week, we're going to have continued coverage and our reporters down there with a lot of breaking news on technology.
[00:34:31.528 --> 00:34:38.794]  Edward Snowden is going to be appearing via video connection from Moscow and a lot more in the next two weeks.
[00:34:38.814 --> 00:34:39.795]  And I will be staying here.
[00:34:40.496 --> 00:34:50.664]  I have politely cancelled my trip to England and the Oxford speech because too much is going on with the situation in Ukraine and so much more.
[00:34:51.385 --> 00:35:06.258]  We're going to get into leaked phone call Kiev snipers hired by U.S.-backed opposition and play the Estonian Foreign Minister in talks with the U.S.-backed opposition leader.
[00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:09.241]  So all of that is going to be coming up.
[00:35:09.281 --> 00:35:12.303]  A pretty big story up on Infowars.com.
[00:35:12.804 --> 00:35:13.725]  Some of the other news.
[00:35:13.825 --> 00:35:14.305]  Video.
[00:35:14.365 --> 00:35:17.148]  Bloomberg wants to ban free speech on Facebook.
[00:35:17.824 --> 00:35:22.989]  They're actually working to not let any pro-gun stuff be there, or to let gun shops even be on there.
[00:35:23.009 --> 00:35:23.649]  Just, it's over.
[00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:29.335]  As a matter of constitutional protected right, they're going to shut down our First Amendment, not just our second.
[00:35:29.995 --> 00:35:30.936]  Order out of chaos.
[00:35:30.976 --> 00:35:33.478]  Gladio snipers behind killings in Kiev.
[00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:35.360]  That's Nemo's article that goes along with Watson's.
[00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:36.641]  Leaked phone call.
[00:35:36.681 --> 00:35:38.763]  Kiev snipers hired by U.S.-backed opposition.
[00:35:39.264 --> 00:35:41.486]  And the big Red Link story I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:35:43.115 --> 00:35:43.657]  Showdown!
[00:35:43.777 --> 00:35:48.168]  Maryland to target 110,000 citizens with gun confiscation.
[00:35:48.188 --> 00:35:50.834]  That's right, and it ties into the story.
[00:35:52.057 --> 00:36:00.719]  Of course, from a couple days ago, where they are sending out letters saying, oh, you didn't get your gun registered in time, come turn it in.
[00:36:00.759 --> 00:36:05.401]  We don't care if you fill out the registration paperwork, come turn it in, in Connecticut.
[00:36:05.441 --> 00:36:11.202]  So, and they're basically passed laws where you can't manufacture guns in California with the micro-stamping.
[00:36:11.682 --> 00:36:12.303]  I mean, it's on.
[00:36:13.883 --> 00:36:18.006]  Lead smelter that could create bullets closed last year here in the United States.
[00:36:18.106 --> 00:36:20.208]  I mean it is full tilt buggy.
[00:36:21.088 --> 00:36:25.352]  The death by a thousand cuts against the Second Amendment that's going on.
[00:36:25.672 --> 00:36:28.254]  But we're winning the hearts and minds every metric shows.
[00:36:29.235 --> 00:36:32.717]  So that's the good news of what's going on on that front.
[00:36:32.737 --> 00:36:37.701]  That's some of what's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:49.437]  Before we get into this leaked phone call and play a clip from that, please don't forget this hour is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com.
[00:36:49.917 --> 00:37:03.248]  And if you go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex, you'll find their best specials on three months food supply, four week food supply, their great survival seed vault that's so good we carry it, and it's one of the best non-GMO packages out there for the price.
[00:37:04.281 --> 00:37:05.182]  Jumbo Seed Packs.
[00:37:05.222 --> 00:37:08.304]  They've got everything you need to be prepared, and they're great patriots.
[00:37:08.384 --> 00:37:12.207]  When FEMA tried to buy out all their food last year, they said no, and blew the whistle.
[00:37:12.227 --> 00:37:14.588]  A lot of other folks didn't blow the whistle and let them buy them out.
[00:37:15.009 --> 00:37:16.610]  So they're ready to ship to you right now.
[00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.152]  They've got it all at mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.
[00:37:20.653 --> 00:37:21.734]  Be prepared, folks!
[00:37:22.354 --> 00:37:25.136]  Don't be dependent on the system with all the instability.
[00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:26.957]  Have that storable food that lasts 25 years.
[00:37:28.178 --> 00:37:30.599]  And continuing, we are Lister Supported.
[00:37:31.019 --> 00:37:43.643]  When you become a member of the Nightly News and see the films, the Nightly News, the expanded podcast, commercial-free audio, video, all of it, you are funding a true tip of the spear pro-liberty media operation that is growing.
[00:37:44.423 --> 00:37:48.765]  And you can get a $5.95 monthly membership or get a yearly membership and get three months free.
[00:37:49.969 --> 00:37:50.910]  Off the regular price.
[00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:56.432]  And 11 people can sign in simultaneously with each username and passcode.
[00:37:56.452 --> 00:38:00.514]  So create an original username and passcode that isn't anything else you have.
[00:38:00.954 --> 00:38:04.616]  It's totally secure as long as it's a passcode that isn't your other stuff.
[00:38:05.817 --> 00:38:07.217]  And share it with your friends and family.
[00:38:07.338 --> 00:38:09.218]  You can give it as a gift.
[00:38:09.299 --> 00:38:09.939]  Prison planet.
[00:38:12.406 --> 00:38:27.338]  And lastly, if you go to InfoWarsTore.com, you can find the wise variety of non-GMO high-quality seeds at the lowest prices, the incredible variety of the best supplements we've found out there, bar none, including three supplements we've developed, Survival Shield,
[00:38:28.118 --> 00:38:38.322]  Full of fluoride shield and super metal vitality as well as the Wake Up America coffee from the high mountains of southern Mexico and the organic volcanic soil bought directly from the Chiapas farmers.
[00:38:38.823 --> 00:38:41.324]  The two different Wake Up America blends, my favorite coffee.
[00:38:41.644 --> 00:38:46.566]  Everybody says it's their new favorite or at least they love it and it's very fairly priced and supports transmission.
[00:38:47.006 --> 00:38:48.226]  Simply put, here's my philosophy.
[00:38:48.607 --> 00:38:50.828]  I don't get stimulus money like MSNBC.
[00:38:50.888 --> 00:38:51.308]  I don't get
[00:38:52.668 --> 00:38:54.889]  Hundreds of millions of dollars a year like NPR taxpayer money.
[00:38:55.190 --> 00:39:00.332]  I don't take money from the IRS or like Warren Buffett and Banker Bailout money.
[00:39:00.612 --> 00:39:03.374]  We just sell the highest quality stuff I can find at the best price.
[00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:12.618]  We go out and buy thousands of a dash cam that's the best price, the highest quality and have it branded to InfoWars.com.
[00:39:14.279 --> 00:39:17.300]  And then it comes with a free memory stick and we have the same price as Amazon.
[00:39:18.281 --> 00:39:20.082]  Nobody can match the price of Amazon.
[00:39:20.122 --> 00:39:20.482]  We've done it.
[00:39:22.859 --> 00:39:26.442]  On the dash cams, and then you're supporting free speech in the Republic.
[00:39:27.222 --> 00:39:31.445]  We've got the magazine, the March issue, the War on Men with John Wayne on the cover.
[00:39:31.906 --> 00:39:35.568]  All about putting drugs in the food and water to emasculate men.
[00:39:36.149 --> 00:39:38.290]  You can buy that in bulk at cost.
[00:39:40.852 --> 00:39:42.073]  Again, that's our goal.
[00:39:42.153 --> 00:39:42.994]  Get the word out.
[00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.135]  Wake people up.
[00:39:44.952 --> 00:39:46.353]  Some of the stuff we have is at cost.
[00:39:46.373 --> 00:39:48.774]  Some of it has profit built in to help fund the operation.
[00:39:49.074 --> 00:39:50.215]  But the magazine's at cost.
[00:39:50.455 --> 00:39:54.117]  We have the best-selling ever, Molon Labe, men's and women's.
[00:39:54.177 --> 00:40:00.061]  The men's is bronze-colored with the two crossed M4s and the Spartan helmet with the victory wreath.
[00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:02.202]  Molon Labe, Info Wars on the back.
[00:40:02.842 --> 00:40:06.363]  It says InfoWars with 1776 and Roman numerals.
[00:40:06.883 --> 00:40:09.284]  Then we have an InfoWars version of the Molon Labe as well.
[00:40:09.584 --> 00:40:17.007]  And we have the women's, I think it's the best women's shirt we've ever put out, that is gold foil sprayed on and is, you know, women's cut.
[00:40:17.667 --> 00:40:19.208]  And it is just fabulous.
[00:40:19.328 --> 00:40:25.950]  Men, get this for your wife or your sweetie cake, your cupcake, today and support the transmission.
[00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:30.411]  You can go up there and see Leanne McAdoo sporting the Second Amendment.
[00:40:30.431 --> 00:40:31.412]  We've got to get her out shooting the .50.
[00:40:32.432 --> 00:40:33.573]  Time to take the reporters out.
[00:40:33.853 --> 00:40:41.156]  David Knight, Jakari Jackson, John Bowne, of course, LeeAnn McAdoo, everybody.
[00:40:41.796 --> 00:40:42.856]  And take them shooting.
[00:40:42.916 --> 00:40:44.217]  Watson's coming soon to the U.S.
[00:40:44.277 --> 00:40:45.637]  I'm going to take him out there shooting.
[00:40:46.038 --> 00:40:46.618]  He'll love that.
[00:40:46.638 --> 00:40:49.759]  I'm going to go shooting again with Mike Judge sometime next week.
[00:40:50.299 --> 00:40:51.680]  Maybe he'll let me film it and put it out.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.380]  That should be interesting.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.602]  We're going to be shooting some exploding targets at, I think, a thousand yards.
[00:40:57.182 --> 00:40:58.883]  But side issue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:00.228 --> 00:41:01.789]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:09.592]  But if you want to find the subsections, the Made in America Apparel, madein1776.com leads you right to that sub area of the shopping cart.
[00:41:10.232 --> 00:41:13.053]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplement area.
[00:41:13.533 --> 00:41:15.274]  So that's how you navigate that.
[00:41:15.574 --> 00:41:16.394]  That's how you do that.
[00:41:16.794 --> 00:41:19.876]  By the way, I want to get your take on the IRS situation.
[00:41:20.396 --> 00:41:23.477]  You can't take the fifth under penalty of perjury.
[00:41:23.517 --> 00:41:25.878]  They make you waive your fifth to fill out the tax form.
[00:41:27.056 --> 00:41:28.496]  You try to plead the fifth, doesn't work.
[00:41:28.996 --> 00:41:34.777]  This is a private collection agency for the private Federal Reserve, established in 1913, didn't go mainline until 1951.
[00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:51.980]  But the pig-like creature up there heading up the persecution division, the inquisition of Second Amendment folks, or the purge of the Second Amendment folks and the Tea Party and the rest of it, she takes the fifth.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.861]  What's your take on that subject?
[00:41:55.734 --> 00:41:58.256]  That's what I'm opening the phones up to take a round of calls on.
[00:41:58.276 --> 00:41:59.217]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:59.237 --> 00:41:59.757]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:59.857 --> 00:42:07.683]  We'll go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:42:08.164 --> 00:42:11.346]  But first off, leaked phone call.
[00:42:11.426 --> 00:42:14.969]  Kiev snipers hired by U.S.-backed opposition.
[00:42:15.449 --> 00:42:17.151]  False flag killings used to
[00:42:18.595 --> 00:42:22.196]  Delegitimize the government that was ousted.
[00:42:22.936 --> 00:42:41.443]  The tales of leaked phone calls between EU Foreign Affairs Chief Catherine Ashton and Estonian Foreign Minister Umas Tait suggest that the US-backed opposition was responsible for hiring snipers who gunned down protesters in Kiev and not the deposed government of Viktor
[00:42:42.554 --> 00:42:43.294]  How do you pronounce that?
[00:42:43.755 --> 00:42:44.355]  Yanukovych?
[00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:45.315]  Am I pronouncing that right, guys?
[00:42:45.415 --> 00:42:45.956]  Yanukovych?
[00:42:46.396 --> 00:42:47.036]  I am pronouncing it right?
[00:42:47.476 --> 00:42:49.057]  As the media widely claimed.
[00:42:49.957 --> 00:42:50.798]  Continuing here.
[00:42:51.658 --> 00:43:02.643]  During the phone call, Pate tells Ashton that evidence presented to him by a doctor who treated victims of the Sniper attacks clearly indicates both police and protesters were being shot at by the same people.
[00:43:02.983 --> 00:43:04.464]  Yes, to create the illusion.
[00:43:06.265 --> 00:43:08.165]  And this is what Operation Gladio would do.
[00:43:08.326 --> 00:43:10.026]  And Kurt Nemo's article gets into that.
[00:43:10.647 --> 00:43:11.327]  How NATO
[00:43:13.339 --> 00:43:16.285]  And again, I'm not defending the Russians during the Cold War.
[00:43:16.366 --> 00:43:18.370]  It's that both sides did dirty stuff, okay?
[00:43:19.172 --> 00:43:24.062]  NATO did hundreds of bombings and shootings, from Germany to Italy, from France to...
[00:43:25.592 --> 00:43:34.676]  Ukraine, you name it, into non-NATO countries at the time, where if communists started getting too popular, they'd shoot people and blame it on them or bomb people and blame it on them.
[00:43:34.696 --> 00:43:39.758]  If right-wing groups got too popular and they didn't like where they were going, they would shoot people and blame it on them.
[00:43:39.958 --> 00:43:42.759]  If mainline groups, I mean, they did this over and over again.
[00:43:42.779 --> 00:43:45.601]  This got declassified by the Italian government 14 years ago.
[00:43:47.383 --> 00:43:49.365]  And then even more about three years ago, and the U.S.
[00:43:49.405 --> 00:43:50.245]  government had to admit it.
[00:43:50.806 --> 00:43:53.909]  NATO was involved, the British were involved, the Germans were involved.
[00:43:54.229 --> 00:43:55.850]  They called them stay-behind networks.
[00:43:56.591 --> 00:44:01.135]  After World War II, a lot of the Nazi-held areas, the U.S.
[00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:04.238]  just took over the Nazi networks that were there, like Ukraine.
[00:44:05.138 --> 00:44:10.163]  Western Ukraine continued to use them to carry out terror attacks, but they were being directed by the West.
[00:44:11.423 --> 00:44:17.825]  So, that's how this operates, and people need to be made aware of that.
[00:44:19.686 --> 00:44:26.128]  And I watched how this went, how the police tried to stand down so they wouldn't look bad, to give them the political support.
[00:44:27.188 --> 00:44:33.991]  Then they start getting shot, and our media is calling them freedom fighters, and Precision, you know, throwing Molotov cocktails at police cars, burning them up.
[00:44:37.011 --> 00:44:38.372]  Very serious situation.
[00:44:39.212 --> 00:44:49.016]  And look, if the Ukrainians want to overthrow their government, that's their business, but the West is in there stirring it up, overthrowing an elected government, and now putting people in even worse so the EU can suck them dry.
[00:44:50.776 --> 00:44:52.617]  This is the type of stuff they'll do in America.
[00:44:53.277 --> 00:44:55.318]  They will commit mass shootings and blame it on the Tea Party.
[00:44:55.358 --> 00:44:56.678]  You can see all the writing on the wall.
[00:44:57.079 --> 00:44:58.999]  They will commit new Oklahoma cities and blame it on us.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.320]  And I'm just saying,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.081]  It's all they've got left.
[00:45:03.922 --> 00:45:11.171]  The problem is they know our people are everywhere and are going to run with video cameras to the next Oklahoma City, to the next mass shooting.
[00:45:11.652 --> 00:45:18.380]  They know, myself or my reporters, will march in to the press conferences with the evidence.
[00:45:20.009 --> 00:45:21.170]  And they're like, well, why don't they just kill you?
[00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:22.531]  Because they can't kill everybody, folks.
[00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:23.491]  They could blow up in their face.
[00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:31.816]  They want to stage the event, have it highly compartmentalized, and have 95% of the police and military that aren't aware of what's going on not know about what's happening.
[00:45:32.437 --> 00:45:40.422]  That's why they're so weak, because they're staging the terror attacks and provocateuring them, and then hoping no one picks up on what they did and just buy the official story.
[00:45:41.363 --> 00:45:44.405]  I mean, we exposed the underwear bomber was CIA drugged and put on the plane.
[00:45:44.666 --> 00:45:49.650]  That came out in Congress a month and a half after we broke it here with the eyewitnesses, two lawyers that saw it happen.
[00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.912]  Kurt Haskell and his wife both saw it out of Michigan.
[00:45:53.513 --> 00:45:54.634]  And what they said turned out to be true.
[00:45:56.055 --> 00:45:57.016]  And it just keeps happening.
[00:45:57.076 --> 00:45:58.117]  We have the intel.
[00:45:58.517 --> 00:46:00.318]  We have the human intelligence.
[00:46:00.358 --> 00:46:01.099]  We have the people.
[00:46:01.399 --> 00:46:02.140]  And we're watching.
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:02.840]  We're not stupid.
[00:46:03.381 --> 00:46:10.326]  And what really freaks them out is military and police listen, and they now know what's going on.
[00:46:11.352 --> 00:46:12.972]  And let me tell you, cops, too.
[00:46:13.552 --> 00:46:15.273]  You may take part in some federal drill.
[00:46:15.853 --> 00:46:19.914]  If they tell you it's secret, it may just be a drill a hundred times.
[00:46:20.474 --> 00:46:39.918]  But the 101st time, or the 120th time, they're going to have you in a real terror attack, and that backpack's going to be real, and they're going to blow you up at the shopping mall and say, oh, the right-wing libertarian cop, you know, John Johnson, or whatever his name's going to be, or, you know, Harry Murphy,
[00:46:40.973 --> 00:46:42.194]  Or Bob Sanchez.
[00:46:43.015 --> 00:46:45.517]  Yeah, he had Ron Paul literature at his house.
[00:46:45.617 --> 00:46:46.157]  Oh my God.
[00:46:46.577 --> 00:46:48.899]  He went in during a field trip at a mall.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.062]  I'm throwing up hypothetical names and people's names really match that.
[00:46:52.522 --> 00:46:53.503]  John Doe, whatever.
[00:46:53.963 --> 00:46:55.084]  I'm telling you how they work.
[00:46:55.204 --> 00:46:55.925]  Do not be part of it.
[00:46:57.006 --> 00:46:57.726]  Do not be part of it.
[00:46:58.287 --> 00:47:02.770]  That movie Arlington Road is so accurate how they actually do it.
[00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:03.651]  Didn't you have Bridges in that?
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:14.647]  And how they pick the professor who's a libertarian and upset about the government and then set him up to make it look like he blows up the federal building.
[00:47:14.667 --> 00:47:17.430]  I'm going to tell you folks, that's exactly how they operate.
[00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.290]  Okay?
[00:47:20.172 --> 00:47:22.173]  That's exactly how these people operate.
[00:47:24.956 --> 00:47:26.937]  Better understand that.
[00:47:27.197 --> 00:47:28.458]  That movie's basically real.
[00:47:29.499 --> 00:47:30.560]  That is how they operate.
[00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:35.024]  And I'm going to tell you right now, you don't want to be part of it.
[00:47:35.964 --> 00:47:37.205]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:47:37.245 --> 00:47:39.646]  Let's talk to Nicholas in Virginia.
[00:47:39.706 --> 00:47:40.367]  You're on the air.
[00:47:40.427 --> 00:47:40.827]  Go ahead.
[00:47:42.668 --> 00:47:43.789]  Thanks for having me on, man.
[00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:46.330]  I've been listening to you for about a year and a half now.
[00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:49.372]  One of my friends, Ryan Addison, turned me on to you.
[00:47:50.593 --> 00:47:52.754]  I've really got a lot of great information from you.
[00:47:53.995 --> 00:47:54.755]  Don't thank me, brother.
[00:47:54.795 --> 00:47:55.276]  We're all in it.
[00:47:55.696 --> 00:47:56.616]  We're all in it to win it.
[00:47:56.636 --> 00:47:57.257]  We're in it together.
[00:47:58.376 --> 00:47:58.836]  Thank you, sir.
[00:47:59.417 --> 00:48:01.938]  So I'm calling about Obamacare.
[00:48:02.558 --> 00:48:13.705]  I actually switched jobs in November of last year and they took my health insurance away from me or they were going to make me pay $1,000 a month to keep my health care.
[00:48:14.445 --> 00:48:21.970]  And so now they put us through the marketplace and we got a new plan that we had to purchase separate health care and a separate dental.
[00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:28.435]  I went to the dental place about a month ago for some work, just fillings, nothing big.
[00:48:29.235 --> 00:48:32.978]  I was told there's no pre-existing condition waiting period, there was no... So what happened?
[00:48:32.998 --> 00:48:36.820]  Because we're not really talking about Obamacare right now, we're talking about IRS, but it all ties together.
[00:48:37.121 --> 00:48:37.521]  What happened?
[00:48:38.729 --> 00:48:45.032]  So, essentially, they sent me a bill telling me that my insurance company was not going to pay my bill.
[00:48:45.713 --> 00:49:02.382]  So, when I went to the dentist, my dentist told me there is no conditions, there's no waiting periods, and then when they checked the system about a week or two ago and sent me the bill again, they had gone back into the system and changed to where
[00:49:03.428 --> 00:49:08.835]  Now there's pre-existing conditions, and now there's six-month waiting periods for no matter what.
[00:49:08.855 --> 00:49:10.557]  No, no, that's what it does.
[00:49:10.617 --> 00:49:15.243]  It brings in waiting periods for pre-existing conditions, but it promises you the opposite.
[00:49:15.283 --> 00:49:19.968]  It is the greatest screwjob of all time, and I appreciate your call, and I'm sorry that's happening.
[00:49:20.689 --> 00:49:22.189]  You should do a YouTube video about it.
[00:49:22.449 --> 00:49:33.132]  Everybody who's been hurt by this should speak out, write an article about it, do a YouTube, go to Craigslist, everywhere you can, your voice is important and just universally decry it.
[00:49:33.412 --> 00:49:39.434]  They have a poll out yesterday, 9 out of 10 Texans are against Obamacare and want it repealed.
[00:49:39.514 --> 00:49:41.094]  Why isn't it being repealed by the Republicans?
[00:49:42.375 --> 00:49:45.436]  Nationally, 8 out of 10 people across the board are against Obamacare.
[00:49:45.757 --> 00:49:46.677]  Why isn't it being repealed?
[00:49:46.977 --> 00:49:48.418]  Because the establishment wants it.
[00:49:48.758 --> 00:49:53.640]  They didn't pass something bold, a bold screwjob like this, because they intended for it to get repealed.
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.341]  And if they get away with this, folks, the sky's the limit.
[00:49:58.802 --> 00:50:01.663]  And I said I was taking calls on the IRS, and I see loaded phones.
[00:50:01.703 --> 00:50:06.666]  Chris and Joe and Dr. D and Steve, you all want to talk about the IRS and the subject I brought up.
[00:50:06.686 --> 00:50:08.446]  I'm not mad at the last caller, but man, come on.
[00:50:09.187 --> 00:50:11.428]  I said only on the IRS, and it's about something else.
[00:50:14.476 --> 00:50:16.218]  But I understand it's painful and you want to talk about it.
[00:50:16.438 --> 00:50:17.119]  Believe me, I get it.
[00:50:20.623 --> 00:50:23.026]  Everybody I know, including myself, said their insurance would go way up.
[00:50:24.749 --> 00:50:28.353]  And it's painful and it's shutting down the economy, it's making most people go to part-time.
[00:50:28.733 --> 00:50:30.255]  It's designed to break this country's back.
[00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:33.837]  And by the way, that's not rhetoric.
[00:50:34.618 --> 00:50:41.583]  The whole thing about the website not working is a diversion, and that's now admitted, away from the legislation itself.
[00:50:41.623 --> 00:50:42.544]  And I called that day one.
[00:50:42.584 --> 00:50:43.665]  I'm not bragging, it's just a fact.
[00:50:44.105 --> 00:50:46.967]  I know how these kleptocrats, how their criminal brains work.
[00:50:48.429 --> 00:50:54.794]  And now you've got, speaking of Obamacare, Ezekiel Emanuel out saying you don't even deserve to see a doctor.
[00:50:54.854 --> 00:50:55.234]  That's the quote.
[00:50:55.254 --> 00:50:56.235]  Let me give you the exact quote.
[00:50:57.436 --> 00:50:58.977]  Now here it is, Obamacare architect.
[00:50:59.257 --> 00:51:00.238]  You don't need a doctor.
[00:51:01.263 --> 00:51:03.344]  Chief, that's your free healthcare is go die in the ditch.
[00:51:04.464 --> 00:51:10.647]  Uncover a simple privacy loophole that can stop the NSA spying thugs in their tracks at PrivacyLockdown.com.
[00:51:10.807 --> 00:51:16.369]  The NSA has already shut down hundreds of sites, and to truth be told, they could shut down this operation at any time.
[00:51:16.669 --> 00:51:22.791]  See, the privacy loophole I'm about to show you allows you to make all your sensitive information disappear in the next 30 days or less.

[00:51:34.312 --> 00:51:35.352]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:35.432 --> 00:51:39.753]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:51:39.913 --> 00:51:45.534]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:51:45.634 --> 00:51:47.734]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[00:51:47.794 --> 00:51:48.975]  No word about IRAs.
[00:51:49.215 --> 00:51:51.775]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:52:55.882 --> 00:52:59.345]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:52:59.365 --> 00:53:00.566]  You have a system that cuts out
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:19.264]  About the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:53:19.384 --> 00:53:30.373]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:53:30.393 --> 00:53:33.075]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.

[00:53:42.603 --> 00:53:53.850]  Herbicides, chloramines, ammonium and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:59.493]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:54:16.756 --> 00:54:23.341]  All right, we're going to go directly to your phone calls here on the IRS if you just joined us.
[00:54:23.921 --> 00:54:33.227]  And Lois Lerner says that citizens don't have a Fifth Amendment when questioned by the Federal Reserve's collection agency, the offshore bank's collection agency, literally, but that she does.
[00:54:33.848 --> 00:54:41.733]  And then she always uses that to go on and plead the Fifth to say she's not testifying, but then to go on to say she's done nothing, even though she got caught lying a year ago.
[00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:45.195]  So, Chris in California, you're on the air.
[00:54:45.255 --> 00:54:46.156]  What's your take on this?
[00:54:48.206 --> 00:54:48.506]  Hello?
[00:54:48.967 --> 00:54:49.707]  Yes, welcome!
[00:54:50.167 --> 00:54:51.548]  Yeah, no, it's at California.
[00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:51.849]  Sorry.
[00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.929]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:55.071]  It's an absolute, it's a joke.
[00:54:55.331 --> 00:54:55.971]  She's out there.
[00:54:56.011 --> 00:54:57.713]  She's got her eight armed guards.
[00:54:58.153 --> 00:54:59.234]  She's smirking.
[00:54:59.314 --> 00:55:01.695]  She knows exactly what she's doing.
[00:55:02.116 --> 00:55:06.098]  But the good thing for us, it shows the veil falling on the whole system.
[00:55:06.198 --> 00:55:06.879]  It's a sham.
[00:55:06.979 --> 00:55:08.300]  Everybody's starting to wake up.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.221]  I'm watching all the boards.
[00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:15.104]  CNN, MSNBC, I don't care what side it is, people are calling them out.
[00:55:15.445 --> 00:55:16.385]  People are upset.
[00:55:16.465 --> 00:55:17.366]  People are waking up.
[00:55:17.976 --> 00:55:19.997]  I think we're almost hitting critical mass, Alex.
[00:55:20.728 --> 00:55:26.769]  Well, it is true that, as Mark Twain said, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[00:55:27.089 --> 00:55:31.550]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:35.771]  And really, a lot of people weren't bad in the system, they were just scared.
[00:55:36.551 --> 00:55:41.293]  And as more people speak out, now they can't persecute everyone that speaks out.
[00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:43.873]  That's that Hollywood tipping point I've talked about.
[00:55:43.893 --> 00:55:45.753]  They're not really liberals in Hollywood, most of them.
[00:55:46.134 --> 00:55:47.614]  Most of them are actually kind of libertarians.
[00:55:48.732 --> 00:55:54.125]  Or what you'd call a conspiracy terrorist, meaning they don't buy the official account of things out of hand.
[00:55:54.927 --> 00:55:55.769]  So I agree with you.
[00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:56.090]  Go ahead.
[00:55:56.983 --> 00:55:58.143]  Right, that's the point, Alex.
[00:55:58.183 --> 00:55:59.204]  You're doing a great job.
[00:56:00.044 --> 00:56:02.224]  Everybody needs to stand up and call it out.
[00:56:02.364 --> 00:56:03.405]  Don't be afraid.
[00:56:03.725 --> 00:56:14.047]  I was in a cooking class the other day with my girlfriend and a woman was in there talking about how she was going to stop guns and guns and I spoke up.
[00:56:14.667 --> 00:56:18.128]  Everybody needs to speak out because there's more of us than there are of them.
[00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:18.588]  That's right.
[00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:20.789]  She heard some anti-gunner in there and you stood up to her.
[00:56:21.792 --> 00:56:22.613]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:22.693 --> 00:56:23.874]  Don't let them fool you.
[00:56:24.395 --> 00:56:25.636]  What did she do when you spoke out?
[00:56:25.656 --> 00:56:29.440]  Try to ban your free speech like Bloomberg's doing right now?
[00:56:29.541 --> 00:56:30.662]  Oh, she got all indignant.
[00:56:30.682 --> 00:56:31.783]  Well, I'm over here.
[00:56:31.843 --> 00:56:32.504]  I'm over here.
[00:56:32.584 --> 00:56:34.726]  It's typical trendy liberalism.
[00:56:35.267 --> 00:56:35.988]  It's pathetic.
[00:56:36.973 --> 00:56:39.074]  Well, these are people just begging to be slaves.
[00:56:39.534 --> 00:56:45.217]  I only want a massive government that murders people worldwide to have weapons, not us average slaves.
[00:56:45.537 --> 00:56:46.557]  I'm with the system.
[00:56:46.577 --> 00:56:47.678]  I have no instincts.
[00:56:47.998 --> 00:56:48.938]  I have no common sense.
[00:56:48.978 --> 00:56:49.959]  I'm a moron.
[00:56:50.779 --> 00:56:54.140]  But the TV says I'm good, and it's my imaginary friend.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:57:00.583]  They're literally in love with a mind control device, just like the movie Her, and literally aren't even living in the reality.
[00:57:00.663 --> 00:57:01.603]  I appreciate your call, Chris.
[00:57:02.084 --> 00:57:04.845]  Dr. D in Arizona, go ahead.
[00:57:06.118 --> 00:57:06.979]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[00:57:07.019 --> 00:57:07.359]  Good, my friend.
[00:57:07.399 --> 00:57:09.260]  What's your take on our loving Lois Lerner?
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:09.580]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.022]  I was so outraged about that dog and pony show this morning.
[00:57:13.042 --> 00:57:24.629]  I've been trying to get in and share this idea with you how we can end corruption, end all this old back-and-forth gridlock, and all this nonsense that goes on up in those houses that we pay for.
[00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:26.430]  The taxpayers need a voice.
[00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:27.971]  That's the missing component of government.
[00:57:29.292 --> 00:57:43.090]  I would hope that you would get on this and we would try to start a coalition together and build a big coalition of people to demand that we have monitors in all the houses of government, that the citizens be allowed to submit their questions directly to their congressmen and people,
[00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:49.312]  And if they don't want to do this, then remove him, frog watch him right off the floor, Sergeant Robinson, get some work in.
[00:57:49.853 --> 00:57:51.293]  And let's end this nonsense now.
[00:57:51.313 --> 00:57:53.754]  I mean, there's corruption now by putting monitors in there.
[00:57:53.774 --> 00:58:02.858]  Remember what Jim DeMint said about government, I think before he left office, that most of the laws are passed at night by a skeleton crew of congressmen?
[00:58:03.018 --> 00:58:03.699]  No, that's true.
[00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:05.880]  The IRS was passed by three senators.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.921]  The Federal Reserve was passed.
[00:58:07.381 --> 00:58:09.703]  Most of this stuff is done by the insiders.
[00:58:09.723 --> 00:58:10.083]  You're right.
[00:58:10.123 --> 00:58:18.089]  Get rid of the committee chairman having all the power and get rid of all the national security secrecy that they've used to make it secret.
[00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:19.350]  I mean, you just said it.
[00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:24.114]  It's secrecy in government is what has made us insecure and led us to this point.
[00:58:24.574 --> 00:58:25.075]  Absolutely.
[00:58:25.115 --> 00:58:25.615]  God bless you.
[00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:30.239]  Good point, Dr. D. We're going to come back for five or six more minutes and talk to Joe
[00:58:31.079 --> 00:58:33.181]  And talk to Steve and Gloria.
[00:58:33.441 --> 00:58:36.844]  Then we've got Stefan Molyneux in studio with us.
[00:58:37.925 --> 00:58:40.428]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[00:58:40.448 --> 00:58:42.890]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:58:44.832 --> 00:58:48.235]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:48.275 --> 00:58:50.137]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:54.147 --> 00:58:57.468]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:58:57.588 --> 00:58:59.829]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:58:59.989 --> 00:59:08.291]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:59:08.591 --> 00:59:23.896]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[00:59:24.176 --> 00:59:24.636]  I don't know.
[00:59:57.205 --> 00:59:59.147]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:59.607 --> 01:00:02.509]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.074 --> 01:00:09.715]  Big Brother.
[01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:11.416]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:12.157 --> 01:00:13.237]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:14.718]  You want answers?
[01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:16.440]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.244 --> 01:00:25.287]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.754 --> 01:00:43.903]  Well, the architect of BozoCare, Ezekiel Emanuel, Dr. Death, Dr. Death Panel, he's come out and said, you don't need a doctor.
[01:00:44.023 --> 01:00:45.405]  You just need to go to a kiosk.
[01:00:45.905 --> 01:00:52.473]  Remember Jakari Jackson went to Walmart and they had some robot literally diagnosing with diabetes and say he was a beast or whatever?
[01:00:52.493 --> 01:00:56.077]  Even though he's in great shape?
[01:00:57.418 --> 01:01:00.099]  I mean, that's the type of stuff that's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:00.299 --> 01:01:03.861]  Walmart robo-doctor kiosk promotes Obamacare.
[01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:08.824]  Elysium-like machine tells Jakari Jackson he's obese and should sign up for Obamacare.
[01:01:10.605 --> 01:01:13.186]  And so we're going to show that report along with that with Stefan Molyneux.
[01:01:14.747 --> 01:01:16.948]  Coming up in the next segment, here's a big story we're going to be covering.
[01:01:17.008 --> 01:01:20.970]  CIA employees face new inquiry amid clash on detention program.
[01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:23.631]  Turns out the CIA was spying on the Senate.
[01:01:24.211 --> 01:01:24.972]  Well, of course they were.
[01:01:25.891 --> 01:01:26.852]  So that's all coming up.
[01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:34.516]  Right now, let's go back to your calls on the IRS taking the fifth, even though they tell you you can't, on your tax filings.
[01:01:35.777 --> 01:01:38.758]  But hey, you know, four legs good, two legs better.
[01:01:39.639 --> 01:01:42.140]  Here on the animal farm, Joe in California.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:42.741]  You're on the air.
[01:01:42.781 --> 01:01:43.161]  Go ahead.
[01:01:43.181 --> 01:01:45.783]  Hello, Alex.
[01:01:46.143 --> 01:01:46.543]  Hey, buddy.
[01:01:47.944 --> 01:01:48.504]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:01:49.225 --> 01:01:49.945]  I'm doing alright.
[01:01:49.985 --> 01:01:51.546]  Just doing a little radio show, you know.
[01:01:53.679 --> 01:01:53.959]  Awesome.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:02:02.727]  Well, it's just another example of how it's one set of rules for them and a different set of rules for all the rest of us slaves.
[01:02:04.148 --> 01:02:07.431]  Well, slaves is the operative word because it is an unconstitutional tax.
[01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:10.213]  It is in the Communist Manifesto to have an income tax.
[01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.276]  The average American didn't pay an income tax until 1951.
[01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:17.453]  I mean, this is an alien thing.
[01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:22.536]  I'll never forget that Ron Paul was on CNN once, and, what'll we do if we get rid of the income tax?
[01:02:22.837 --> 01:02:23.957]  What'll build the government?
[01:02:23.977 --> 01:02:24.338]  What running?
[01:02:24.358 --> 01:02:26.879]  He goes, this capital was built before we had an income tax.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.523]  The income tax doesn't run the country, it goes to interest on the debt to the Federal Reserve.
[01:02:31.803 --> 01:02:33.544]  But hey, don't let facts get in the way of it.
[01:02:33.864 --> 01:02:35.165]  Go ahead, sir, I'm sorry, make a point.
[01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.427]  Well, you know, here's the thing.
[01:02:39.028 --> 01:02:43.651]  If they're going to continue to ignore us, and implement things that we don't want,
[01:02:44.378 --> 01:02:46.861]  Like an example, uh, Obamacare.
[01:02:47.602 --> 01:02:50.886]  Uh, you know, you fully implement that when we told you we don't want it.
[01:02:51.547 --> 01:02:53.069]  We're not going to pay taxes anymore.
[01:02:53.529 --> 01:02:55.932]  Life, the lifeblood of this whole system is money.
[01:02:56.332 --> 01:02:58.575]  If they don't have money, they can't function.
[01:02:58.915 --> 01:03:01.959]  They can't send troops in to attack if they don't have money to pay them.
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.301]  So, cut them off.
[01:03:06.124 --> 01:03:06.904]  Very well said.
[01:03:06.964 --> 01:03:07.625]  No, I agree.
[01:03:07.905 --> 01:03:16.209]  And withdraw consent from the system, speak out against it, take our moral authority away from them, point out that literally we're run by offshore banks, and it's over.
[01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:18.371]  The occupation will begin to fall.
[01:03:19.091 --> 01:03:20.192]  They want us poor.
[01:03:20.232 --> 01:03:21.212]  The globalists admit this.
[01:03:21.272 --> 01:03:26.895]  They set the economy up to make it artificially scarce because they don't want us being, quote, uppity.
[01:03:27.035 --> 01:03:27.776]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:28.656 --> 01:03:36.619]  By the way, Paul Watson was on for a long time last night on The Savage Nation with Michael Savage breaking down the whole Ukraine situation.
[01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:47.223]  It's an excellent in-depth talk by two men, one in the UK, one in San Francisco, California, on what happened there and it's a fascinating interview.
[01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:49.224]  I was listening to it this morning and was almost
[01:03:49.944 --> 01:03:50.505]  Late to work.
[01:03:50.525 --> 01:03:52.428]  I wasn't really late to work, but I want to get here two hours early.
[01:03:52.448 --> 01:04:00.342]  I only got here an hour before showtime because I listened while I was getting ready this morning doing research to the whole interview and it's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:01.023 --> 01:04:02.605]  Paul Joseph Watson and...
[01:04:04.181 --> 01:04:13.425]  Michael Savage, really discussing hardcore issues, breaking the left-right paradigm, drilling into the geopolitical machinations of the New World Order.
[01:04:13.945 --> 01:04:21.348]  Stefan Molyneux, philosopher, futurist, best-selling author, will be joining us, hailing from Canada.
[01:04:21.368 --> 01:04:24.509]  He's going to be in studio on the next segment, a little bit into the next hour with us.
[01:04:24.949 --> 01:04:28.031]  But I'm sure we'll be able to talk about the IRS with you guys, Steve and Robert, and
[01:04:28.971 --> 01:04:35.818]  Fred, and Dave, and Mike, and many others, we will be getting to all of you with him as well.
[01:04:35.898 --> 01:04:45.387]  But I'm going to first cover the statist religion, which he agrees is more dangerous than a lot of people that are controlled by establishment religion.
[01:04:45.927 --> 01:04:50.772]  And again, I'm a religious person, I'm a spiritual person, but I'm not an establishment religion person.
[01:04:51.212 --> 01:04:53.775]  But I don't get mad at folks that say, I can't see it, I don't believe it.
[01:04:55.302 --> 01:05:00.236]  What I get mad at is atheists that tend to replace one thing with a statement, God.
[01:05:00.256 --> 01:05:03.185]  And he agrees that those atheists are dangerous.
[01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:13.384]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:05:13.464 --> 01:05:21.691]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:05:21.872 --> 01:05:26.536]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:05:26.736 --> 01:05:33.420]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:33.521 --> 01:05:40.605]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:05:40.705 --> 01:05:47.570]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:52.073]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:05:52.213 --> 01:05:55.395]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:05:55.595 --> 01:06:01.719]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:06:01.879 --> 01:06:04.081]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:05.202]  The facts are in.
[01:06:05.382 --> 01:06:06.502]  The studies are legion.
[01:06:06.783 --> 01:06:14.147]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:06:14.308 --> 01:06:17.730]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:18.530]  Simple.
[01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:23.133]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:28.876]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:06:29.116 --> 01:06:45.185]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:06:45.445 --> 01:06:47.306]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:06:47.406 --> 01:06:49.687]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.848]  I use Fluoride Shield everyday.
[01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:57.471]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:06:57.732 --> 01:07:01.994]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:07:02.134 --> 01:07:03.595]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[01:07:04.475 --> 01:07:09.081]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:07:09.201 --> 01:07:12.184]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:07:12.325 --> 01:07:17.571]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:07:17.891 --> 01:07:19.553]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:07:19.833 --> 01:07:21.075]  We are what we eat.
[01:07:21.455 --> 01:07:25.778]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:07:26.118 --> 01:07:30.121]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:07:30.341 --> 01:07:32.682]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:07:32.902 --> 01:07:38.826]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[01:07:39.126 --> 01:07:41.368]  To learn more visit InfoWarsHealth.com

[01:08:22.806 --> 01:08:27.288]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.469 --> 01:08:40.194]  Every time that I look in the mirror All these lines in my face get clearer The past is proof
[01:08:51.786 --> 01:08:52.715]  Dust to dust.
[01:08:56.226 --> 01:09:05.809]  Alright, Stefan Molyneux is with us about 10-15 minutes into the next hour and we'll have open phones throughout that third hour coming up interspersed with news.
[01:09:06.949 --> 01:09:25.495]  Stefan is here in Texas going around on tour, best-selling author from Canada, and I wanted to get him in here to talk about his futurist view on the world and where things are going, but to also go over some of the contemporary news that is unfolding in the world today.
[01:09:26.425 --> 01:09:32.016]  And then we also have government-run health care, where now they promise no new regulations on doctors.
[01:09:33.058 --> 01:09:33.459]  It is 155,000...
[01:09:38.208 --> 01:09:39.529]  And the coming changes are vast.
[01:09:39.549 --> 01:09:49.393]  The number of codes will explode from 17,000 under the current system to 155,000 under the new one, according to the Centers for Medical and Medicine Services.
[01:09:49.913 --> 01:09:56.396]  And it's designed to totally destroy all free, independent medical centers, doctors, you name it, all the smaller clinics and hospitals.
[01:09:56.436 --> 01:10:02.939]  It was written by big hospitals and foreign insurance companies and offshore insurance companies to totally shut everything down but them.
[01:10:03.459 --> 01:10:09.923]  It's a monopoly takeover to take you from 40 hours to less than 30 hours a week to not cover pre-existing conditions.
[01:10:10.563 --> 01:10:13.345]  Government being involved with corporations screwed up our health care.
[01:10:13.725 --> 01:10:17.127]  If you think it was already bad, it was the best 50 years ago here in the U.S.
[01:10:17.147 --> 01:10:18.228]  Hands down, not debated.
[01:10:18.628 --> 01:10:20.349]  Royalty came here from around the world.
[01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:22.130]  Now it's going to be the worst.
[01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:24.612]  So the weekly standard has those numbers.
[01:10:25.753 --> 01:10:29.355]  We're also going to be getting into the architect of it.
[01:10:29.975 --> 01:10:32.356]  Ezekiel Emanuel, we have the clip coming up.
[01:10:32.416 --> 01:10:36.158]  He says, we'll get to it at the bottom of the hour, you don't even need a doctor.
[01:10:36.918 --> 01:10:37.639]  It's like Cuba.
[01:10:37.699 --> 01:10:39.840]  I mean, you've got plenty of doctors and health care.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.822]  You just get a cane if your knees are bad or a cane if you're going blind.
[01:10:43.842 --> 01:10:46.563]  I mean, just a cane is the answer.
[01:10:47.043 --> 01:10:49.945]  So everybody's like, I want the health care like England.
[01:10:50.505 --> 01:10:56.128]  You ever watch the parliamentary stuff on C-SPAN where they admit 18 months to get a broken leg fixed and stuff?
[01:10:57.208 --> 01:11:02.170]  Wow, you folks, you're really in for a rude awakening, just like we told you Obamacare would increase your prices.
[01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:08.572]  We're going to get into this move to disarm people as well, and the whole climate change push for taxation.
[01:11:09.212 --> 01:11:12.133]  Just a bunch of news with our guest.
[01:11:12.494 --> 01:11:14.794]  Hillary Clinton calls Vladimir Putin Hitler.
[01:11:15.155 --> 01:11:16.075]  Takes one to know one.
[01:11:17.015 --> 01:11:19.036]  This is all coming up with Stefan Molyneux.
[01:11:19.496 --> 01:11:24.078]  And again, he is the founder and host of Free Domain Radio.
[01:11:24.878 --> 01:11:31.221]  It's one of the largest and most popular philosophical shows in the world with more than 2,400 podcasts, 10 books and 50 million downloads.
[01:11:31.241 --> 01:11:31.902]  That's an old bio.
[01:11:31.922 --> 01:11:33.303]  It's more than that now.
[01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:35.924]  And he spread the cause of liberty philosophy to listeners throughout the world.
[01:11:36.644 --> 01:11:38.485]  And I'm not going to go over his whole background.
[01:11:38.505 --> 01:11:41.307]  But prior to that, he was a thriving career and software entrepreneur.
[01:11:41.787 --> 01:11:46.693]  An executive in 2006, he left his work in the tech industry to devote his efforts to free domain radio.
[01:11:47.113 --> 01:11:56.003]  Now a self-identified full-time parent and philosopher or thought criminal, Stefan speaks regularly at Liberty-themed events across North America and South America.
[01:11:56.724 --> 01:12:04.366]  And he's author of two novels, Revolutions and the God of Atheists, as well as eight non-fiction books on relationships, government, and religion.
[01:12:04.786 --> 01:12:07.107]  And freedomainradio.com is his site.
[01:12:07.167 --> 01:12:08.387]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:12.648]  If you just joined us with infowars.com, you can follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[01:12:12.948 --> 01:12:15.789]  Before I go anywhere, I want to thank you for coming to join us.
[01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:17.210]  Oh, it's my pleasure.
[01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:18.270]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:28.796]  I'm actually in town for the Texas Bitcoin Conference tomorrow, and it's a real pleasure to... I mean, we've done a couple of shows remotely, so it's very nice to be able to do a show face-to-face.
[01:12:29.216 --> 01:12:30.277]  Well, it's good to have you here, brother.
[01:12:30.597 --> 01:12:33.799]  Now, there's so much I want to throw out, but I want to cover the waterfront here.
[01:12:34.938 --> 01:12:41.106]  Quantifying, because I know you're a smart guy when it comes to history, that's why I like having you on, because I'm somewhat of a history novice myself.
[01:12:41.606 --> 01:12:48.775]  Looking at the wider spectrum, I believe undoubtedly we're in the bottom of a very decadent phase in the cycle, but coming out of that could be renaissance.
[01:12:49.136 --> 01:12:50.297]  I want to see A, if you agree with that, B,
[01:12:51.917 --> 01:13:01.642]  What do you expect the statist, who are the biggest religion in the world, versus one of the other largest religions, the liberty lovers, you know, who just are into humans and human empowerment.
[01:13:01.922 --> 01:13:02.842]  Call it a religion if you want.
[01:13:03.042 --> 01:13:05.043]  Point is, humans tend to organize in that fashion.
[01:13:05.784 --> 01:13:11.206]  What do we do, and what's going to happen as the statist discover it's not delivering, it's a fraud, it's a lie?
[01:13:11.566 --> 01:13:14.087]  They tend to double down and call for 100% taxation.
[01:13:14.468 --> 01:13:16.849]  The taxing class tends to start engaging in tax fraud.
[01:13:17.529 --> 01:13:19.970]  Where you have a $3,000 truck and they say, we say it's worth $30,000.
[01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:24.373]  That's not happening to friends of mine who have like 93 Chevy Silverados.
[01:13:24.453 --> 01:13:27.574]  And then the state just says, sorry, pay that.
[01:13:27.614 --> 01:13:28.575]  We're not giving you your sticker.
[01:13:29.215 --> 01:13:30.136]  This is happening everywhere.
[01:13:30.416 --> 01:13:33.037]  What's going to happen as they double down historically?
[01:13:33.357 --> 01:13:34.318]  What comes out of that?
[01:13:34.658 --> 01:13:44.403]  What are they going to go through with the singularity stacked on top of it with all the societal crises and all the super bugs and like everything coming to a head?
[01:13:44.603 --> 01:13:46.204]  What do you expect to happen?
[01:13:47.128 --> 01:13:51.614]  Well, violence, of course, is an addiction, and most addictions have to run their course.
[01:13:51.955 --> 01:14:03.631]  You know, most people who get involved in addictive behavior end up escalating and escalating and escalating, and our focus on trying to use government violence to solve complex social problems
[01:14:04.272 --> 01:14:04.832]  I think you're right.
[01:14:04.892 --> 01:14:05.833]  It's in its death throes.
[01:14:05.873 --> 01:14:07.194]  I mean, how much further can it go?
[01:14:07.274 --> 01:14:19.102]  I mean, taxation, if you count debt and so on, and you count all this scaled taxes all embedded in your income and in your bills and in your regulations and so on, 60, 70, 80 percent, who even knows what it is?
[01:14:19.182 --> 01:14:21.464]  How much bigger, how much more powerful can it get?
[01:14:21.524 --> 01:14:23.125]  How much more debt can a country run into?
[01:14:23.405 --> 01:14:26.587]  How many more military bases can the United States have overseas?
[01:14:26.907 --> 01:14:33.492]  I think we're reaching the end, mathematically and morally, of this focus on trying to use the state to solve social problems.
[01:14:34.452 --> 01:14:49.360]  The idea that you can solve social problems voluntarily and peacefully and virtuously and cooperatively is an Enlightenment idea that got eclipsed by the progressive movement, the communist movement, the socialist movement of the 20s where a whole bunch of people... Who claims the moral high ground?
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.561]  Yeah, yeah, claim the moral high ground.
[01:14:50.601 --> 01:14:56.506]  We can solve poverty, we can solve illness, we can make everybody educated, we can teach the poor.
[01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:59.389]  And now, I mean, the whole thing is completely unraveling.
[01:14:59.749 --> 01:15:06.736]  You don't see a lot of calls outside of Obamacare, which I think was pretty unique in that the Democrats just had all the cards in one moment in history.
[01:15:07.256 --> 01:15:09.198]  You don't see a lot of call for big government programs.
[01:15:09.398 --> 01:15:16.264]  You don't actually even see that much of a call for more government spending on things like education because they're spending so much and getting so little result.
[01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:21.188]  I think people are recognizing that more money, more power is not going to solve the problem.
[01:15:21.208 --> 01:15:23.030]  And then people are beginning to look for alternatives.
[01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:29.095]  It's still early, but we have to be out there saying, no, coercion is never going to work to solve these problems.
[01:15:29.555 --> 01:15:32.178]  Coercion is like a drug for a toothache.
[01:15:32.198 --> 01:15:33.659]  You know, you take heroin for a toothache.
[01:15:33.979 --> 01:15:40.902]  You feel fine for a little while, and then the rot sets in deeper, and then when you do finally go see the dentist, it's way worse than if you'd gone up front.
[01:15:41.382 --> 01:15:48.566]  So in a democracy, you can bribe a whole bunch of people with the money of the unborn, you can sell off, you know, the fetuses to the banksters around the world.
[01:15:48.826 --> 01:15:54.048]  The bill comes due, and the longer we push it off, the worse it's going to be, and I think people are just kind of getting around to the point now.
[01:15:54.128 --> 01:15:56.049]  And there's not any economists that deny that now?
[01:15:56.429 --> 01:16:00.552]  You're right, we've reached the point now where 10 years ago we'd talk about this, oh, that doesn't exist.
[01:16:01.092 --> 01:16:04.795]  Now, it's like, okay, you're right, it's going on, but what are you going to do about it?
[01:16:05.115 --> 01:16:07.396]  Well, the stimulus package, the whole Keynesian thing, right?
[01:16:07.436 --> 01:16:12.800]  Like, oh, well, there's a dip in the demand, which is the result of prior Fed policies and pushing everyone into a home policies.
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:16.843]  And people say, well, the stimulus package is going to even things out and then it's going to grow again.
[01:16:17.423 --> 01:16:23.647]  Well, they had the largest stimulus package in the history of the known universe, and the economy is still a complete mess.
[01:16:23.807 --> 01:16:28.670]  So I think people are no longer... They're hitting the gas pedal, but there's no gas getting to the engine.
[01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:31.152]  I think people are recognizing it's just not working anymore.
[01:16:31.252 --> 01:16:38.176]  And I hope that people are beginning to look at voluntary options for solving some very deep social problems, half of which are natural to the human condition.
[01:16:38.196 --> 01:16:45.681]  Sure, but what do you expect to happen in the interim as those that follow the god of the state discover that the golden calf isn't going to deliver?
[01:16:47.386 --> 01:16:49.027]  Well, you say some of them are going to double down.
[01:16:49.268 --> 01:16:51.770]  And those people we have to call out on a moral basis.
[01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:53.591]  I think the practical argument has been won.
[01:16:53.672 --> 01:17:01.919]  You know, libertarians have been saying for 40, 50 years, or if you count classical liberals, 250 years, that the state is not going to produce anything good in the long run.
[01:17:02.179 --> 01:17:05.842]  We've won the practical argument because the results are just so catastrophic around us.
[01:17:05.862 --> 01:17:06.763]  Thomas Jefferson is right.
[01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:07.843]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:07.904 --> 01:17:10.325]  Nobody's arguing, well, a bit more state and we'll be fine.
[01:17:10.365 --> 01:17:13.106]  You know, I mean, this is the death throes of the addiction to state coercion.
[01:17:13.746 --> 01:17:25.892]  But what we need to stop hitting people with, Alex, is the moral argument that when they say more taxation will solve the problem, what they're saying is more violence, more theft, more stealing, more stealing.
[01:17:26.272 --> 01:17:28.416]  More debt is going to solve the problem.
[01:17:28.436 --> 01:17:32.043]  That they're advocating an escalation of violence to solve complex problems.
[01:17:32.063 --> 01:17:33.064]  We've got to call them out morally.
[01:17:33.325 --> 01:17:37.492]  The practical argument has been won, but we need to hit them hard in the moral solar plexus, so to speak.
[01:17:38.843 --> 01:17:39.503]  I agree with you.
[01:17:39.523 --> 01:17:43.446]  Let me just throw a total wild card at you because I keep seeing this in the news.
[01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:53.032]  Every time I turn around, leaders in government and the people that are over the quote child porn investigations are reportedly involved in it.
[01:17:53.312 --> 01:17:54.132]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[01:17:54.432 --> 01:17:57.154]  Why did number 10 cover up AIDS child porn arrest?
[01:17:57.514 --> 01:18:04.018]  Downing Street only confirms details when pressed by mail as further sex allegations against PM's friend emerge.
[01:18:04.038 --> 01:18:05.119]  Here's an example of government.
[01:18:05.579 --> 01:18:08.081]  Statistically, truancy officers and CPS
[01:18:08.581 --> 01:18:10.625]  People can look this up at the highest level of pedophilia.
[01:18:11.146 --> 01:18:14.773]  So the people that are over stopping it are the ones that are involved in it.
[01:18:15.134 --> 01:18:17.017]  I mean right there proves the whole state argument.
[01:18:17.518 --> 01:18:18.180]  Why is that?
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.402]  I mean what is that?
[01:18:20.185 --> 01:18:22.567]  People who wish to do evil congregate to the state.
[01:18:22.787 --> 01:18:28.731]  I mean, this isn't just the BBC, this is the government run, you have to pay the taxes for it whether you like it or not.
[01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:29.732]  A bunch of pedophiles run it.
[01:18:29.752 --> 01:18:34.255]  Yeah, a bunch of pedophiles, just Jimmy Seville and all these people with like a 30-year pedophile ring going on up there.
[01:18:34.575 --> 01:18:40.319]  People in power are the people who want power, are the people who want to get over the rules they're imposing on others.
[01:18:40.859 --> 01:18:47.521]  I mean, did you read this John Kerry quote about how horrible it is to invade a sovereign country when he was talking about Putin and Ukraine?
[01:18:48.121 --> 01:18:51.642]  I mean, the level of hypocrisy shown by those in power is astounding.
[01:18:51.662 --> 01:18:56.023]  It's like watching two alcoholics scream, you're a drunk, at each other when they're both complete alcoholics.
[01:18:56.063 --> 01:18:58.084]  So people who want to do great evil...
[01:18:58.644 --> 01:19:04.169]  ...gravitate to where you're exempt from the moral rules and exempt from the law, which is at the top of the status apparatus.
[01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:11.915]  That's why expecting the state to save us from evil, the state is a giant magnet for evildoers, and it gives them the most possible power that you can have in this known universe.
[01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:16.059]  So it seems to me that if you want to do terrible things like rape children...
[01:19:16.599 --> 01:19:18.060]  Yeah, gravitate towards the government.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:26.445]  The SEC, during the financial crisis, the lead up to the financial crisis, the amount of pornography that was found on the SEC computers ran into the thousands.
[01:19:26.885 --> 01:19:34.070]  They had PowerPoint presentations of rampant pornography being developed and shown in the SEC, while they were supposed to be guarding everybody's financial interests.
[01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:39.573]  Well, you know, if you're into looking at porn at work, of course you want to go work for the government, because in the private sector you'd be tossed out.
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:55.474]  It's just amazing how disconnected they are, and really, historically, it's government, Nero, Caligula, examples are Legion, that become delusional, announce their God, and then build pyramids and say, bring your children up here to be sacrificed to me, to show your ultimate service to them.
[01:19:55.975 --> 01:20:00.158]  The whole world becomes a giant Jim Jones cult, drinking government Kool-Aid.
[01:20:00.459 --> 01:20:02.321]  We'll be right back with Stefan Molyneux.

[01:20:33.581 --> 01:20:42.845]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:42.885 --> 01:20:43.605]  This capitalism?
[01:20:43.665 --> 01:20:49.788]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:49.848 --> 01:20:53.469]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:23:02.887 --> 01:23:05.470]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:10.616]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:23:10.876 --> 01:23:18.685]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:18.965 --> 01:23:23.288]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:23:23.508 --> 01:23:27.331]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:27.471 --> 01:23:33.194]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:33.435 --> 01:23:36.196]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:36.597 --> 01:23:41.740]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:51.926]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage, or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:24:04.292 --> 01:24:07.714]  We will not be forgotten.
[01:24:07.854 --> 01:24:09.956]  We won't be left behind.
[01:24:09.996 --> 01:24:10.616]  Our difference in all
[01:24:12.583 --> 01:24:13.463]  We are back live.
[01:24:13.543 --> 01:24:14.723]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:24:14.864 --> 01:24:17.144]  Stefan Molyneux is with us, I guess, 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:24:17.164 --> 01:24:21.465]  We'll start taking your calls coming up here in about 20 minutes on any subject you'd like to discuss.
[01:24:22.085 --> 01:24:23.945]  IRS persecutions, you name it.
[01:24:24.406 --> 01:24:30.447]  Lois Lerner taking the fifth, even though the IRS tells American slaves they can't take the fifth on their tax forms.
[01:24:31.207 --> 01:24:33.187]  And then we're going to get into the fake global warming.
[01:24:33.227 --> 01:24:34.648]  It's Stefan Molyneux's take on that.
[01:24:34.668 --> 01:24:35.368]  The incredible
[01:24:35.888 --> 01:24:39.130]  Anti-gun confiscation garbage that's going on.
[01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:42.133]  The victim disarmament that's going on is unprecedented.
[01:24:42.173 --> 01:24:46.696]  Now Bloomberg wants Facebook to not allow you to have pro-gun posts defending the Second Amendment.
[01:24:47.156 --> 01:24:49.098]  I mean, this is really unprecedented.
[01:24:49.118 --> 01:24:50.319]  The statists are now losing
[01:24:50.959 --> 01:24:53.920]  The intellectual battles, they're moving towards censorship.
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.081]  That's coming up in the next long segment.
[01:24:56.421 --> 01:24:58.082]  This segment's only six minutes long.
[01:24:58.582 --> 01:25:00.983]  And Stefan, I know you're a big geopolitical analyst.
[01:25:01.304 --> 01:25:06.386]  I wanted to get your take on the situation in the Crimea, in the Ukraine.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:14.323]  Well, I guess the first thing to recognize is that up until 1953, the Ukraine was part of Russia, and they still very much identify.
[01:25:14.343 --> 01:25:20.226]  I mean, the whole eastern half of the country speaks Russian and is very nationalistic, very Russian nationalistic.
[01:25:21.326 --> 01:25:22.487]  It is one of the most corrupt...
[01:25:24.428 --> 01:25:26.369]  Autocracies in all of Europe.
[01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:28.631]  In fact, in all the world outside of Africa.
[01:25:28.671 --> 01:25:30.472]  I mean, the level of corruption is... It's a mess.
[01:25:30.532 --> 01:25:31.033]  Shaggering.
[01:25:31.093 --> 01:25:32.434]  I mean, the amount of dead and so on.
[01:25:32.734 --> 01:25:34.255]  Now, they want to join the EU.
[01:25:34.936 --> 01:25:39.479]  A study came out, I shouldn't laugh because it's just tragic, but a study came out in, I think... Out of the fire into the furnace.
[01:25:39.639 --> 01:25:48.185]  Yeah, I mean, the amount of corruption in the EU has been estimated conservatively as about the same size as the entire economy of Ukraine.
[01:25:48.505 --> 01:25:52.788]  So the idea that they're going to go to the EU to try and get away from corruption is completely mad.
[01:25:52.808 --> 01:25:54.269]  Yeah, it's out of the frying pan into the fire.
[01:25:55.049 --> 01:26:01.571]  Now, of course, Russia has for many years been paying the Ukraine to store the fourth fleet in Crimea.
[01:26:01.831 --> 01:26:14.494]  And in a time of instability, when they don't know which way the government is going to go, it seems to me, I don't know for sure, but it seems to me that Putin is simply saying, I need to go in and secure my fleet because I don't know what's going to happen to the government.
[01:26:14.574 --> 01:26:22.376]  And this is exactly, I mean, if Turkey was about to be taken over, if America thought Turkey was about to be taken over by a communist government, they would move in to secure their bases.
[01:26:22.396 --> 01:26:24.057]  They would move in to secure their military assets.
[01:26:24.657 --> 01:26:27.339]  Plus this is right on the Russian border and used to be part of Russia.
[01:26:27.759 --> 01:26:32.963]  So it's, I'm not defending Russia, it's just the West is in there starting the whole thing as my issue.
[01:26:33.584 --> 01:26:47.955]  Yeah, and of course Russia, Putin, one of Putin's arguments is, look, he says, I stood behind America when they went into Iraq, which I disagreed with, when they wanted some of the Eastern bloc countries to join EU and NATO, I didn't stand in the way, but you know, enough interference.
[01:26:48.055 --> 01:26:51.398]  You know, he feels that the West is coming in and interfering on stuff right on the border.
[01:26:51.658 --> 01:26:55.401]  And remember what happened in 62 when the missiles were going to be installed in Cuba.
[01:26:55.781 --> 01:26:58.623]  I mean, America went insane because it was right off the coast of America.
[01:26:58.703 --> 01:26:59.924]  And this is right off the coast.
[01:27:00.404 --> 01:27:01.005]  Oh, right off the coast.
[01:27:01.045 --> 01:27:02.446]  It's right attached to Russia.
[01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:04.407]  And it was a former satellite, so.
[01:27:04.467 --> 01:27:05.008]  No, but you're right.
[01:27:05.048 --> 01:27:07.610]  They're moving NATO ships into that area as well.
[01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:07.910]  Yeah.
[01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:09.631]  So it's a major escalation.
[01:27:09.811 --> 01:27:16.676]  And America has been spending $5 billion over the past 15, 20 years to promote its agenda in Ukraine.
[01:27:17.717 --> 01:27:31.827]  And, you know, there have been some reports that some of the protesters are being directly paid by American satellite organizations and so on, so that is an extreme invasion of sovereignty of Eastern Europe and of Russia.
[01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:34.569]  Again, not to defend Russia, it's an autocracy and Putin's a horrible thug.
[01:27:34.589 --> 01:27:42.034]  But it's a giant provocation and in common law and in common sense, you start something, you lose moral high ground, which shows the delusional nature
[01:27:42.974 --> 01:27:50.979]  With Kerry saying you can't invade countries, when they just did this to Syria, they just did this to Libya, and now they actually started this operation.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.581]  It just shows the hubris.
[01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:56.703]  You raised the point of Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney and Obama laughing at them.
[01:27:57.003 --> 01:28:04.308]  Yeah, so in a debate with Mitt Romney in the last cycle, Mitt Romney said, well, you know, Russia could do something in the Ukraine.
[01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:08.931]  And Barack Obama laughed at him and said, the 1980s are calling, they want their foreign policy back.
[01:28:09.592 --> 01:28:10.792]  The Cold War's been over for 20 years.
[01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:21.017]  I think the Democratic Party has always had a pretty soft spot for Russia since the Al-Drahis incident and the HUAC, and they were covering up so much of spies, Russian spies inside.
[01:28:21.037 --> 01:28:27.780]  Well yeah, I mean, putting libertarians and conservatives and freedom lovers in death camps is their dream, so Stalin was kind of their rock star.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:31.362]  Yeah, and the covering up of Stalin's crimes and all of this kind of stuff.
[01:28:31.522 --> 01:28:35.005]  Let's just put it this way, they have pin-ups, spread, centerfolds of Stalin.
[01:28:35.165 --> 01:28:39.589]  Oh yeah, they've really been very pro-Communist, very pro-Russia, because they're on the left, right?
[01:28:40.029 --> 01:28:46.334]  You know, the moment is like, anti-Russia on the left is about as prevalent as anti-war sentiments when you have a Democrat in the White House.
[01:28:47.214 --> 01:28:49.536]  Yeah, so I think that they're not really seeing things very clearly.
[01:28:49.596 --> 01:29:01.263]  Russia has changed to some degree, but it is still remains very autocratic, very dictatorial, and you know this guy came out of the KGB ranks not known for its touchy-friendly democratic feeler.
[01:29:01.363 --> 01:29:05.545]  So I think it is not something that is going to be a huge escalation situation.
[01:29:05.605 --> 01:29:08.907]  It's just that they've moved to protect their military assets when there was an unstable government.
[01:29:08.947 --> 01:29:09.528]  That seems to me...
[01:29:10.208 --> 01:29:11.369]  I mean, I don't agree with any of it.
[01:29:11.389 --> 01:29:13.091]  I mean, it's all just a bunch of thugs.
[01:29:13.171 --> 01:29:17.595]  And the EU just wants to liquidate another corrupt state and suck it dry.
[01:29:17.915 --> 01:29:20.618]  And this group of thugs want to be paid off by the EU for the assets.
[01:29:21.198 --> 01:29:26.083]  I mean, all it is is Russia and the EU and George Soros struggling over looting something.
[01:29:26.303 --> 01:29:30.886]  Well, and now, you know, the way they're being bought off, and it all comes back down to buying people off.
[01:29:30.966 --> 01:29:33.047]  It's all just a mafia movie in nice suits.
[01:29:33.547 --> 01:29:37.169]  But they all end up getting, so now the EU is going to put a $15 billion aid package in.
[01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:39.191]  America's going to kick up another billion dollars.
[01:29:39.211 --> 01:29:40.031]  Loan guarantees!
[01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:41.232]  Yeah, the banks are getting paid.
[01:29:41.252 --> 01:29:42.433]  It's like a payday loan.
[01:29:42.473 --> 01:29:44.394]  Yeah, the banks just get paid and the poor get poorer.
[01:29:44.434 --> 01:29:45.614]  It's the same story over and over.
[01:29:45.634 --> 01:29:52.679]  Alright, I want to come back and cover a host of issues from global warming to the gun grab with Stefan Molyneux and your phone calls.
[01:29:52.739 --> 01:29:53.179]  Stay with us.

[01:31:07.211 --> 01:31:12.053]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:19.417]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[01:32:01.927 --> 01:32:02.707]  InfoWarshop.com
[01:32:03.908 --> 01:32:14.295]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:16.456]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:17.357]  Fluoride!
[01:32:17.537 --> 01:32:19.819]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:19.979 --> 01:32:25.803]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:32:26.043 --> 01:32:30.846]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:32:30.966 --> 01:32:33.688]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[01:32:33.928 --> 01:32:34.488]  We're good.
[01:33:04.670 --> 01:33:05.551]  You got it.
[01:33:05.771 --> 01:33:11.494]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:11.554 --> 01:33:13.676]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:15.937 --> 01:33:21.561]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:23.582 --> 01:33:25.783]  I really do want to cover a whole swath of things.
[01:33:45.767 --> 01:34:05.580]  With our informed guest here today and pick his brain on everything from Bitcoin to the attack on the Second Amendment and free speech and how that's now intersected with Bloomberg wanting to censor pro-gun Second Amendment defense online, and this is just unprecedented really criminal Level larceny going after our basic rights.
[01:34:05.621 --> 01:34:14.466]  I mean we should all just be burning with with with anger But but but I guess the tyrants have gotten us where we're used to being run over by him.
[01:34:14.506 --> 01:34:14.747]  It's just
[01:34:15.607 --> 01:34:17.209]  It's like deer in the headlights.
[01:34:17.269 --> 01:34:19.791]  I'm dumbfounded now by how arrogant they are.
[01:34:19.991 --> 01:34:21.773]  But it is good to see the awakening happening.
[01:34:21.793 --> 01:34:28.960]  But, Stefan, before I segue off into a bunch of my questions, what are some points you haven't gotten to yet?
[01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:32.646]  Well, actually, let's lobby it back to you, Alex.
[01:34:32.866 --> 01:34:39.153]  How do you feel about the departure of dear Piers Morgan from the fair shores of the United States?
[01:34:39.754 --> 01:34:45.580]  Do I need a Kleenex for you with a tear in your eye with great sorrow to see the anti-gun advocate exit the
[01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:56.064]  In a way I am sad because him talking down his nose at everybody and being arrogant and basically saying Americans were all running around with coonskin caps backfired.
[01:34:56.384 --> 01:34:58.165]  He didn't implode.
[01:34:58.245 --> 01:34:59.725]  He imploded day one.
[01:35:00.025 --> 01:35:01.106]  He never succeeded.
[01:35:01.386 --> 01:35:03.206]  He effectively wasn't on the air anymore.
[01:35:03.846 --> 01:35:07.848]  He took 2 million viewers every night and had it down to 380,000 when he left.
[01:35:08.308 --> 01:35:09.608]  And it's the same for MSNBC.
[01:35:09.628 --> 01:35:10.668]  They're all in free fall.
[01:35:10.989 --> 01:35:12.149]  So I ask you the question.
[01:35:13.234 --> 01:35:15.355]  I mean, maybe zombies are real.
[01:35:15.435 --> 01:35:17.137]  I always thought it was medically impossible.
[01:35:17.477 --> 01:35:18.818]  You have zombie banks.
[01:35:18.858 --> 01:35:19.898]  This is zombie media.
[01:35:20.439 --> 01:35:22.660]  Well, look, I mean, the gun thing is tricky.
[01:35:23.421 --> 01:35:28.584]  And it's not tricky because the facts aren't on the side of the First Amendment rights, Second Amendment rights guys.
[01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:31.626]  It's just tricky because people see a gun and they think violence.
[01:35:31.646 --> 01:35:32.607]  They don't think protection.
[01:35:32.847 --> 01:35:33.327]  Sure, I get it.
[01:35:33.347 --> 01:35:40.149]  People see a cop with a gun and they think protection, but they see a private citizen with a gun and the less intelligent among us are like, ooh, that's violent.
[01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:41.190]  Hollywood's told them that.
[01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:45.971]  Yeah, and so the idea that guns prevent crime is kind of confusing to people.
[01:35:46.531 --> 01:35:48.432]  And you know, it's like you exercise and you feel tired.
[01:35:48.472 --> 01:35:50.292]  It's like, well, how is this supposed to make me feel stronger?
[01:35:50.332 --> 01:35:51.453]  It's like you make you feel tired.
[01:35:52.173 --> 01:36:00.042]  So, for people who just live on the surface and say, oh, there's a gun, that must mean there's crime, as opposed to the idea that guns prevent, what, millions of crimes every year?
[01:36:00.062 --> 01:36:00.703]  No, it's unbelievable.
[01:36:00.964 --> 01:36:03.707]  But what you don't see, people have a tough time with, right?
[01:36:03.747 --> 01:36:08.633]  Forty-plus crimes are stopped, FBI's own numbers, they don't like to advertise, for every time it's used in a crime.
[01:36:09.053 --> 01:36:09.273]  Right.
[01:36:09.714 --> 01:36:09.874]  Right.
[01:36:09.914 --> 01:36:14.458]  And they say, well, you know, you're more in danger of shooting yourself with a gun and all that kind of stuff.
[01:36:14.518 --> 01:36:17.240]  It's like, I think this is, statistically, this is all very false.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.302]  Well, such thing, you can't have a car, you might get killed with it.
[01:36:19.322 --> 01:36:20.243]  I mean, nothing's safe.
[01:36:20.563 --> 01:36:20.723]  Right.
[01:36:20.763 --> 01:36:24.206]  So there is this weird, dumb thinking.
[01:36:24.366 --> 01:36:26.926]  Where if you get rid of guns, you get rid of violence.
[01:36:27.247 --> 01:36:28.907]  Which is, again, it's just not true.
[01:36:29.147 --> 01:36:34.428]  It's like, you know, then why don't people say, well, let's get rid of police and we'll get rid of arrests and we'll get rid of jails and then there'll be no violence.
[01:36:34.908 --> 01:36:37.228]  Because nobody is fundamentally against guns.
[01:36:37.288 --> 01:36:44.290]  What they are for, the anti-gun people, what they're for is for guns to be centralized in the hands of the elite.
[01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:47.210]  They are for the guns being centralized in the hands of the cops.
[01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:52.171]  Because if you have anti-gun laws, cops with guns need to go around to people's houses and take those guns away.
[01:36:53.091 --> 01:36:55.072]  Which is now happening in Connecticut and California.
[01:36:55.112 --> 01:36:58.853]  And nobody, this is one thing to be really clear with anti-gun people, they're not anti-gun.
[01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:01.634]  They are very pro-government guns.
[01:37:01.694 --> 01:37:05.435]  They're just anti-private citizens guns, which is always something that happens.
[01:37:05.455 --> 01:37:08.416]  That's right, it's the ultimate form of discrimination.
[01:37:08.456 --> 01:37:13.097]  That's why they obsess on religion and race and sexual preference, because they don't care about all that.
[01:37:13.557 --> 01:37:19.519]  But when it comes to foreign banks getting bailouts, when it comes to them being exempt, diplomatic immunity, they have bodyguards, we don't.
[01:37:19.999 --> 01:37:21.660]  They're flaming hypocrites.
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:26.161]  Yeah, why don't you get the Secret Service to stop having guns, if not having guns around prevents crime?
[01:37:26.201 --> 01:37:33.543]  It's like, I mean, they spend so much money protecting the President with massive amounts of military force, and then for private citizens you can't have protection.
[01:37:33.563 --> 01:37:34.303]  But they love it!
[01:37:34.523 --> 01:37:36.924]  They love it when you don't have private protection.
[01:37:37.024 --> 01:37:37.244]  Why?
[01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:37.924]  Well, you know why.
[01:37:37.984 --> 01:37:40.704]  Because then you're dependent on the government for protection, which will never come.
[01:37:40.724 --> 01:37:41.825]  Look what's happening to Detroit.
[01:37:41.845 --> 01:37:45.426]  It takes an hour or two to get someone to come by after a 9-11 call.
[01:37:45.446 --> 01:37:46.826]  And the police chief said, buy a gun.
[01:37:47.026 --> 01:37:51.307]  Yeah, and basically they're there to identify your body if you're, you know, unlucky.
[01:37:51.787 --> 01:37:57.069]  So the government is continually breaking your leg and saying, then giving you a crutch and saying, see without me you couldn't even walk.
[01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:58.310]  And this is what they do.
[01:37:58.330 --> 01:38:06.174]  They want to take away your protection the same way they want to take away your capacity to create your own job so then you're dependent upon government providing you minimum wage security and all that kind of stuff.
[01:38:06.454 --> 01:38:10.415]  They want to take away your capacity to save so you're dependent upon them for old age pension.
[01:38:10.435 --> 01:38:12.937]  And then they even write white papers like Cloward and Pivot admitting it.
[01:38:13.197 --> 01:38:13.297]  Yep.
[01:38:14.085 --> 01:38:14.445]  Absolutely.
[01:38:14.465 --> 01:38:19.107]  The creation of a dependent underclass is one of the most savage aspects of late-model democracy.
[01:38:19.807 --> 01:38:25.729]  And it's resisted to some degree by the Republicans, but it is avidly pursued by the Democrats.
[01:38:25.789 --> 01:38:28.890]  And now, of course, they want to make you dependent on the government for your health care.
[01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:33.692]  One of the most sensitive, difficult, emotionally draining, and unstable things that happens.
[01:38:33.732 --> 01:38:36.953]  They're going to keep breaking the system until they say, look, we have to take it over.
[01:38:36.993 --> 01:38:37.593]  It's so broken.
[01:38:37.853 --> 01:38:41.594]  And by the way, you said that, everybody else said that, because we know how they operate in other countries.
[01:38:41.674 --> 01:38:44.255]  It's not like this is the first time they've done this.
[01:38:44.295 --> 01:38:45.555]  We watch them over and over again.
[01:38:46.055 --> 01:38:50.797]  And then even Ezekiel Emanuel comes out and says, yeah, we're trying to wreck the health care system right now.
[01:38:51.537 --> 01:38:56.519]  I mean, if I was trying to wreck a fire department, I should be thrown in jail if I wanted to burn down the fire department.
[01:38:56.759 --> 01:39:02.780]  He wants to burn down the health care system, destroy our, and then he's a hero.
[01:39:03.121 --> 01:39:04.381]  And he admits it on Fox News.
[01:39:06.178 --> 01:39:06.739]  It's terrorism.
[01:39:06.979 --> 01:39:07.580]  It's terrorism.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.664]  You know, by any rational definition, it is terrorism.
[01:39:10.684 --> 01:39:11.825]  That's right, he's a terrorist.
[01:39:11.885 --> 01:39:16.752]  Yeah, you are destroying the lifeline for human beings to survive illnesses.
[01:39:17.493 --> 01:39:19.295]  And you are making them dependent upon a system.
[01:39:19.335 --> 01:39:20.597]  Now, it's a beginning.
[01:39:20.657 --> 01:39:24.081]  This happened in Canada, which nationalized healthcare a generation or two ago.
[01:39:24.702 --> 01:39:30.004]  Now, the first generation gets it pretty good, because the doctors all grew up in that system, in the remnants of the free market.
[01:39:30.024 --> 01:39:33.565]  They're used to doing house calls, they're used to being really good at serving their- They're honorable!
[01:39:33.725 --> 01:39:50.652]  Yeah, that doesn't just change- It goes from the machine, it kind of- And then it takes a while for that echo effect to fade away, and then the next generation of doctors who come in, who never faced any free market restrictions, or never had to do customer service, and they basically get paid by the government for ignoring their patients, the second generation is where it really, really gets hit hard.
[01:39:50.832 --> 01:39:52.293]  And that's what happened in Canada as well.
[01:39:52.333 --> 01:39:52.953]  First generation?
[01:39:53.673 --> 01:39:55.655]  Doctors still working hard, they're still caring about them.
[01:39:55.675 --> 01:39:57.596]  But you don't suddenly stop caring because the government takes over.
[01:39:57.876 --> 01:39:59.377]  But the next generation of doctors.
[01:39:59.397 --> 01:40:02.319]  You know, it's like the first generation of the NASA engineers did some great stuff.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.061]  You know, what have they done over the last 30 years?
[01:40:04.101 --> 01:40:06.422]  They've just kept photocopying the space shuttle and calling it progress.
[01:40:07.443 --> 01:40:09.525]  So, this is one thing that is an illusion.
[01:40:09.785 --> 01:40:15.729]  That when you take something over and you've got some free market remnants, it actually works relatively okay and it slowly goes out of focus over time.
[01:40:16.009 --> 01:40:22.454]  Then the next generation, as is so often the case with the government, gets really hosed with debt and a completely dysfunctional system.
[01:40:22.694 --> 01:40:28.075]  I mean, when they first privatized the educational system, teachers didn't wake up not caring anymore, right?
[01:40:28.295 --> 01:40:36.397]  But a generation or two later, when you can no longer get fired and everyone's just going in there to hide out from any free market, yeah, then it gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:40:36.417 --> 01:40:39.938]  But by then the system is too embedded to undo with anything short of revolution.
[01:40:39.958 --> 01:40:42.699]  I mean, sort of a verbal revolution, a revolution in
[01:40:42.759 --> 01:40:53.027]  And no one can deny, look at all the numbers, I mean, the metrics, the lowering test scores, the physically lowering IQ, the obesity, the cancer rates, the saving rates.
[01:40:53.087 --> 01:40:57.391]  I mean, every gauge, the West is in free fall.
[01:40:58.051 --> 01:41:03.175]  And the problem is, you look at everywhere else, they've never even gone up to the heights to fall.
[01:41:03.716 --> 01:41:07.018]  I mean, it's a bad... What do you expect if we don't get the new renaissance going?
[01:41:07.399 --> 01:41:09.681]  An absolute new dark age?
[01:41:09.741 --> 01:41:11.122]  I mean, this is a pretty bad situation.
[01:41:11.857 --> 01:41:30.382]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the one thing that is so frustrating, you know, as a former technology entrepreneur and executive, one thing that's so frustrating, Alex, is that the remnants of the free market keep creating all of these incredible things, you know, like cell phones, where you can video around the world, you know, when you're on a data plan virtually for free.
[01:41:31.583 --> 01:41:38.585]  And all of this stuff that is so incredible, the human productivity, human connectivity, you know, we have the new Gutenberg Press, as you and I talked about in a show before.
[01:41:39.065 --> 01:41:46.233]  Which allows us to communicate the greatest ideas with no gatekeepers, no people in the way between people who've got great ideas and people who can receive them.
[01:41:46.253 --> 01:41:53.160]  You don't have to pass through the censorious... Yeah, we're not saying the technology's bad, it's just that Soron's trying to put his will into the computers.
[01:41:53.561 --> 01:41:53.861]  Go ahead.
[01:41:53.961 --> 01:41:55.163]  The government keeps taking it over.
[01:41:55.763 --> 01:42:01.809]  And that which was designed to facilitate communication and spread ideas is now being used to control... Well, it's like you said, the paradox.
[01:42:01.869 --> 01:42:02.910]  It's true, historically.
[01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:12.098]  A freer country creates so much wealth, everyone's bathing in luxury, then the kids become spoiled, they don't appreciate it, decadence comes in, tyranny comes in.
[01:42:12.158 --> 01:42:13.680]  How do you get by that cycle?
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:19.245]  By having huge human goals that we individually believe in, so collectively carry out?
[01:42:19.685 --> 01:42:25.468]  Well, my argument is that you have to rethink all the basic human institutions that we have inherited from history.
[01:42:25.928 --> 01:42:28.110]  Everything that is inherited is open to question.
[01:42:28.150 --> 01:42:30.451]  You know, we did this with slavery in the West, right?
[01:42:30.551 --> 01:42:34.833]  I mean, the Western European Christian culture fought... We ended it, so we get blamed with it.
[01:42:34.873 --> 01:42:36.154]  Yeah, of course, naturally, right?
[01:42:36.194 --> 01:42:38.115]  I mean, nobody's going to the Muslims for reparations.
[01:42:38.135 --> 01:42:39.836]  They had a far harsher slave trade than the West.
[01:42:39.856 --> 01:42:40.856]  Well, it's going on right now.
[01:42:40.976 --> 01:42:44.018]  Yeah, and only 5% of the slaves in the Atlantic trade ended up in America.
[01:42:44.238 --> 01:42:49.545]  Which, you know, it doesn't justify the institution, but it certainly means that if you're going to look for scapegoats for slavery, you don't start with America.
[01:42:49.645 --> 01:42:57.115]  But what happens is every institution, now we've inherited this centralized, collective, violent monopoly called the state.
[01:42:57.938 --> 01:42:59.879]  I think we need to open it up to question.
[01:42:59.979 --> 01:43:01.601]  Is this the best way to organize society?
[01:43:01.641 --> 01:43:12.928]  Do we really want to get stuck in this continual cycle where the government lets you have some freedom, you generate some wealth, the government takes that wealth and uses it to expand itself at your expense and eventually kills the goose that lays the golden egg?
[01:43:12.968 --> 01:43:20.654]  This cycle has been around since ancient Egypt, ancient Rome, ancient Greece, the modern British Empire, German Empires, Austria, Hungarian Empires.
[01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:21.234]  It's the same thing.
[01:43:21.254 --> 01:43:21.915]  A little bit of freedom.
[01:43:22.555 --> 01:43:23.135]  Make some money!
[01:43:23.395 --> 01:43:27.497]  Government taxes grows into an empire.
[01:43:27.657 --> 01:43:29.397]  They become arrogant, disconnected.
[01:43:29.778 --> 01:43:32.359]  And then you kill the remnants of the free market.
[01:43:32.599 --> 01:43:33.919]  Where is America down now?
[01:43:33.939 --> 01:43:36.140]  They went down like five or six points in the economic free market.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.721]  Oh yeah, well there's like scores of countries ahead of us now.
[01:43:39.341 --> 01:43:41.522]  And in freedom of the press and everything we're going down.
[01:43:42.102 --> 01:43:50.109]  But on the plus side, the mainstream media appears to be having a good internet stake being driven through its heart, which I think is a glorious end to a ghastly beast.
[01:43:50.349 --> 01:43:51.650]  And that brings me to my next point.
[01:43:51.770 --> 01:44:09.065]  They will then respond by trying to censor, and there's moves to not let you deny man-made global warming, Bloomberg moves to ban pro-gun speech, Facebook now working with a former New York mayor to censor support for the Second Amendment, and it goes to these anti-gun sites where they're in talks and admit he's funding it.
[01:44:09.625 --> 01:44:14.287]  To not let pro-Second Amendment speech be on Facebook, and they can have bots that block it.
[01:44:14.307 --> 01:44:16.848]  We've already seen our pro-gun memes being blocked.
[01:44:17.108 --> 01:44:19.629]  People go, well, that's their own, they own that site.
[01:44:19.929 --> 01:44:21.769]  They advertised it as a comment.
[01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.670]  Yes.
[01:44:23.150 --> 01:44:25.811]  They built it on our material, like YouTube.
[01:44:26.491 --> 01:44:32.095]  And then now they're clearly... I mean, this is... We don't know what they're being threatened with behind the scenes.
[01:44:32.255 --> 01:44:35.137]  I mean, I can't imagine that... I'm just saying that's outrageous.
[01:44:35.177 --> 01:44:35.557]  No, it is.
[01:44:35.598 --> 01:44:37.059]  Now Bloomberg wants to get rid of free speech.
[01:44:37.079 --> 01:44:38.039]  That's the beauty of it, though.
[01:44:38.059 --> 01:44:38.600]  Son of a bitch.
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:41.962]  You know, they only shoot at the airplanes over the target.
[01:44:42.542 --> 01:44:42.683]  Right?
[01:44:42.703 --> 01:44:45.044]  When you get close to the target, that's when you get the anti-aircraft.
[01:44:45.064 --> 01:44:46.005]  Oh, we're kicking their butt.
[01:44:46.125 --> 01:44:46.325]  Yeah.
[01:44:46.545 --> 01:44:51.389]  So the fact that, I mean, you know you're achieving something when the powers that be don't like what you're doing.
[01:44:52.209 --> 01:44:55.793]  You know a drug works on an illness when the illness, if it were conscious, would hate that drug, right?
[01:44:55.813 --> 01:45:01.739]  So the fact that there's outrage and frustration and counterattacks, squealing, it's beautiful.
[01:45:01.779 --> 01:45:05.623]  I mean, you know you're doing nothing if nobody is bothered by anything you're doing.
[01:45:05.643 --> 01:45:08.546]  There's a great quote from Churchill where he said, you have enemies, good!
[01:45:09.147 --> 01:45:12.108]  That means that you have stood up for something sometime in your life.
[01:45:12.468 --> 01:45:20.711]  And the fact that people are being attacked for pro-free speech, for pro-gun, for pro-freedom, for pro-trade, for anti-terrorism.
[01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:22.452]  Yeah, don't take it like, oh, I better give up.
[01:45:22.492 --> 01:45:24.132]  Take it like, I'm affecting something.
[01:45:24.192 --> 01:45:25.173]  I'm on to something here.
[01:45:25.313 --> 01:45:26.693]  I'm bothering bad people.
[01:45:26.713 --> 01:45:28.214]  That's what good people are supposed to do.
[01:45:28.234 --> 01:45:29.714]  We're supposed to bother bad people.
[01:45:29.754 --> 01:45:30.615]  That's the whole point.
[01:45:31.255 --> 01:45:33.678]  So I think it's great that there's a lot of flack being sent up.
[01:45:33.898 --> 01:45:37.582]  If there wasn't, we'd be peddling in a basement in the dark doing nothing.
[01:45:37.923 --> 01:45:39.785]  But it does show what authoritarians they are.
[01:45:40.345 --> 01:45:46.693]  They're now sending out hundreds of thousands of letters saying, well, you didn't turn in your semi-automatic handgun, or you didn't register it.
[01:45:47.193 --> 01:45:48.594]  Turn it in or we're going to SWAT team you.
[01:45:48.935 --> 01:45:51.256]  That article is linked on red on Infowars.com.
[01:45:51.917 --> 01:45:54.379]  They're trying to pass another law to expand gun confiscation.
[01:45:54.399 --> 01:45:58.022]  They're banning, basically, gun manufacturing in California with micro-stamping.
[01:45:58.342 --> 01:46:00.784]  They just shut down the last lead smelter for lead bullets.
[01:46:01.104 --> 01:46:03.226]  I mean, so yeah.
[01:46:03.346 --> 01:46:06.709]  I want people, especially young people, lift the curtain, see the gun.
[01:46:07.269 --> 01:46:07.750]  See the gun.
[01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.591]  That is the state.
[01:46:08.611 --> 01:46:13.395]  You know, like, there was this very energetic Occupy movement where they were outraged at the bankers, right?
[01:46:13.435 --> 01:46:17.359]  And they wanted, and they had all these crazy socialist nonsense because, you know, they're academic.
[01:46:17.379 --> 01:46:18.260]  They tried to hijack it.
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:18.900]  Yeah, yeah, I got it.
[01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:29.890]  But what they did see, which was a terrifyingly beautiful thing for the young to see, what they saw was 3,000 activists being arrested and zero bankers.
[01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:32.693]  In fact, the bankers got hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts.
[01:46:32.793 --> 01:46:36.717]  And Homeland Security simultaneously directing it in 35 cities.
[01:46:37.077 --> 01:46:39.099]  They're being scooped up at 2 a.m.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:39.920]  And good.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:45.025]  I'm sorry that it happened to them, but at least they're seeing what it is that they're facing.
[01:46:45.105 --> 01:46:51.912]  And they will be, hopefully, if they've got any brains in their skulls, they will not be tempted to go to the state for solutions when they see the state paying off
[01:46:52.392 --> 01:47:01.398]  The people who prey upon the poor and the middle class and who sell off the unborn in debt and bonds, they will see them rewarding those people and arresting their brothers and sisters in a revolutionary movement.
[01:47:01.598 --> 01:47:04.740]  Hopefully then they will turn away from the state because all we need to do is lift the veil.
[01:47:05.161 --> 01:47:08.883]  Evil can never win because the moment that people see it as evil, they reject it.
[01:47:08.963 --> 01:47:09.824]  Evil always has to collapse.
[01:47:09.844 --> 01:47:10.104]  That's right.
[01:47:10.144 --> 01:47:22.032]  As soon as we understand the New World Order is a private corporate system that's anti-free market, seeking to shut down competition through the state monopoly combine, as soon as those two things are connected by the right wing and the left wing, it's game over.
[01:47:22.632 --> 01:47:39.540]  It's game over that George Soros is basically tax exempt, General Electric, Google, Warren Buffett, his company's 400 plus billion of bailout money the last six years while he lobbies for higher taxes in the middle class because he literally is shutting down his competition while feeding on us like a mosquito.
[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:43.642]  I mean it's game over for that piece of crap the minute that's understood.
[01:47:43.962 --> 01:47:50.506]  Yeah, was it a guy who goes to buy a joint in Colorado has, in that purchase, paid more taxes than all of General Electric?
[01:47:50.666 --> 01:47:51.446]  Yeah.
[01:47:51.486 --> 01:47:53.728]  Yeah, they make up the rules and they exempt themselves.
[01:47:53.748 --> 01:47:58.651]  That's the whole point of power, is to inflict rules on others and escape those rules yourself.
[01:47:58.691 --> 01:48:03.934]  You know, if you could convince everyone else in the world to not be a thief, your job as a thief would be totally easy.
[01:48:04.334 --> 01:48:08.376]  Nobody would have any locks, they wouldn't protect anything, they'd just assume they lost it or mislaid it, right?
[01:48:08.717 --> 01:48:12.139]  The whole purpose of ethics, historically, has been to convince the masses to be good
[01:48:12.859 --> 01:48:16.420]  So that they're productive, which makes them fatter cattle to be preyed on by the rulers.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:20.421]  The rulers give us ethics to make sure we don't compete with their evil.
[01:48:20.702 --> 01:48:22.722]  It's got nothing to do with them actually believing.
[01:48:22.742 --> 01:48:25.183]  You know, thou shalt not steal is a foundational ethic.
[01:48:25.443 --> 01:48:28.344]  I don't believe anyone has ever said, well, but you see, taxation is a form of theft.
[01:48:28.484 --> 01:48:35.392]  That's like Ron Paul's sign, he says don't steal, government doesn't like competition.
[01:48:35.733 --> 01:48:41.600]  I'm an ethical guy and I believe in universal ethics and I believe in virtue.
[01:48:42.021 --> 01:48:47.968]  The problem is they use it to make us simpleton chumps and naive while they are rapacious.
[01:48:48.208 --> 01:48:50.049]  Yeah, I mean, only idiots rob banks.
[01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:52.051]  If you want to be a good bank robber, own a bank.
[01:48:52.371 --> 01:49:01.098]  That's the way, that's the way... Exactly, but make your point uninterrupted about the... Well, it's just so, we're always told, as kids, you know, like, don't steal, don't push, don't use force to get your way.
[01:49:01.118 --> 01:49:02.359]  Negotiate, use your words.
[01:49:02.399 --> 01:49:03.540]  That's what they always say, right?
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.623]  And when you see something like internationally, like what's happening with the Ukraine, what do they do?
[01:49:08.224 --> 01:49:09.865]  They threaten economic sanctions.
[01:49:09.925 --> 01:49:11.406]  They threaten ostracism.
[01:49:11.426 --> 01:49:12.987]  They threaten to cancel travel visas.
[01:49:13.027 --> 01:49:14.328]  They threaten all of this kind of stuff.
[01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:17.771]  They're using their words, not their guns and their bombs.
[01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:20.033]  Because Russia has power, Russia has nukes, right?
[01:49:20.193 --> 01:49:23.055]  The age of European warfare ended with the invention of the nuclear bomb.
[01:49:23.816 --> 01:49:27.158]  But with us, we get guns and we get jail.
[01:49:27.599 --> 01:49:27.899]  With us.
[01:49:27.959 --> 01:49:36.085]  So with each other, with rulers, they all deal with each other diplomatically and they negotiate and they threaten things and so on, but they don't threaten war that much in the West anymore.
[01:49:36.966 --> 01:49:39.328]  But with us, we get guns and we get jail.
[01:49:39.728 --> 01:49:41.649]  And this is the horrible thing.
[01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:43.850]  And it's only because it's safe with us that we don't have nukes.
[01:49:44.391 --> 01:49:45.051]  Yeah, yeah, of course.
[01:49:45.111 --> 01:49:49.154]  I mean, we're the livestock and they care about us insofar as they want us to be productive.
[01:49:49.294 --> 01:49:53.197]  They empathize with us like a farmer empathizes with a cow's desire not to put his face in a lake.
[01:49:53.217 --> 01:49:56.679]  And they describe us, all elites throughout history call their subjects cattle.
[01:49:57.259 --> 01:49:57.899]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:57.919 --> 01:49:59.340]  We're just a form of livestock.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.401]  The Aztecs called their lower class, you know, basically livestock.
[01:50:03.841 --> 01:50:04.942]  Slavs were a livestock.
[01:50:05.142 --> 01:50:08.403]  You know, in the ancient Hebrew stuff, the neighbors were a livestock.
[01:50:08.803 --> 01:50:12.384]  But, I mean, to the Egyptians, everybody else was livestock.
[01:50:12.504 --> 01:50:13.945]  The Nazis, everybody else was livestock.
[01:50:14.445 --> 01:50:15.125]  I mean, that's how it works.
[01:50:15.145 --> 01:50:16.947]  We're going to go to break, come right back with phone calls.
[01:50:17.187 --> 01:50:18.448]  We'll be with us 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:50:18.488 --> 01:50:21.090]  We'll get into the health care, the global warming, all of it.
[01:50:21.150 --> 01:50:32.117]  Please remember, this is listener-supported radio, not with a barrel of a gun like NPR getting half a billion dollars many years of taxpayer money, or MSNBC getting stimulus money while lobbying to raise your taxes.

[01:51:04.299 --> 01:51:07.321]  It's time to kick some ash.
[01:51:07.341 --> 01:51:09.703]  Because cigarettes have met their match.
[01:51:09.863 --> 01:51:12.484]  Smokers are switching to Vapriate e-liquid by Le Cig.
[01:51:12.564 --> 01:51:15.827]  Because when you kick ash, you kick tar and smelly smoke, too.

[01:51:31.677 --> 01:51:32.578]  Kick some ash.
[01:51:34.039 --> 01:51:36.621]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:51:36.761 --> 01:51:40.763]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:51:41.064 --> 01:51:42.285]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:51:42.465 --> 01:51:44.946]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[01:51:45.127 --> 01:51:47.928]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[01:51:48.129 --> 01:51:50.290]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[01:51:50.490 --> 01:51:52.231]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[01:51:52.392 --> 01:51:57.715]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[01:51:57.935 --> 01:52:01.578]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.

[01:52:03.659 --> 01:52:05.120]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:08.503]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:52:08.843 --> 01:52:09.863]  A pair of scissors.
[01:52:10.104 --> 01:52:15.047]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[01:52:15.227 --> 01:52:19.490]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:52:19.890 --> 01:52:20.750]  The phone line.
[01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:26.251]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:52:26.571 --> 01:52:30.132]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:52:30.352 --> 01:52:33.333]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:52:33.953 --> 01:52:36.393]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:52:36.533 --> 01:52:40.714]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:52:41.014 --> 01:52:42.055]  Scissors can't cut it.
[01:52:42.295 --> 01:52:44.595]  And that means your home stays safe.
[01:52:44.615 --> 01:52:48.816]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[01:52:49.016 --> 01:52:52.278]  SimpliSafe home security keeps you safer than the other guys.

[01:53:03.263 --> 01:53:04.143]  The facts are in.
[01:53:04.303 --> 01:53:05.444]  The studies are legion.
[01:53:05.704 --> 01:53:13.127]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:53:13.227 --> 01:53:16.669]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:53:17.029 --> 01:53:17.449]  Simple.
[01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:22.053]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:53:22.333 --> 01:53:27.797]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:53:28.037 --> 01:53:33.361]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:53:33.581 --> 01:53:44.049]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:53:44.369 --> 01:53:48.614]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:53:48.934 --> 01:53:50.797]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[01:53:56.663 --> 01:54:00.928]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:54:01.069 --> 01:54:02.871]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:54:42.233 --> 01:54:45.375]  Make no mistake, as I like to say, we do not live in boring times.
[01:54:45.395 --> 01:54:46.575]  We live in very interesting times.
[01:54:46.615 --> 01:54:50.777]  The old Chinese adage that, yeah, it's interesting, but it also has a double meaning of it's very serious.
[01:54:51.637 --> 01:54:58.701]  And, you know, the crazy thing is I'm just somebody that studied history and common sense, and much of what we've broken down has turned out to be the truth.
[01:54:59.461 --> 01:55:08.569]  They've gone through this process of there's no government drug dealing, there's no government money laundering, there's no cancer viruses being added to the vaccines, there's no covert population reduction programs.
[01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:16.395]  Now it's just all coming out, but it almost just inoculates people psychologically to go, okay, big deal, to where they'll put up with anything.
[01:55:16.435 --> 01:55:20.058]  So, how do you quantify that paradox I'm kind of getting at?
[01:55:21.159 --> 01:55:24.682]  Well, for me at least, being a freedom fighter means always being sorry that I'm right.
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:29.583]  You know, because it's like, I feel like I saw the doctor, you know, you got a patient who smokes and smokes.
[01:55:29.603 --> 01:55:31.043]  You keep saying, man, you got to stop smoking.
[01:55:31.063 --> 01:55:31.864]  It's going to make you sick.
[01:55:31.884 --> 01:55:35.746]  You got to say, and I keep smoking and then he gets sick and you're like, man, I hate being right.
[01:55:36.107 --> 01:55:37.668]  I just, I wish I'd been wrong.
[01:55:37.848 --> 01:55:40.009]  Like, so it all turned out to be not be true.
[01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:41.950]  And we now the poor were no longer poor.
[01:55:42.311 --> 01:55:43.692]  Income disparities had come down.
[01:55:43.792 --> 01:55:48.655]  National debt had been paid off and peace and unicorns and rainbows, you know, populated the planet.
[01:55:49.315 --> 01:55:53.837]  But it is a gruesome thing to know where this kind of system leads.
[01:55:54.198 --> 01:55:56.719]  There is no end to power lust.
[01:55:57.199 --> 01:55:58.140]  You know, they've done studies.
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:03.523]  The acquisition of power over other human beings is more addictive than cocaine.
[01:56:03.943 --> 01:56:09.166]  It actually releases the same kind of chemical hormones in the brain that a drug addiction does.
[01:56:09.246 --> 01:56:14.809]  Yeah, but I like seeing people empowered in art and literature and, you know,
[01:56:15.969 --> 01:56:17.731]  Huge exploration being launched.
[01:56:17.891 --> 01:56:19.232]  I don't like telling people what to do.
[01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:21.913]  No, no, that's, you know, because you're not addicted to power.
[01:56:22.354 --> 01:56:25.836]  But it is a very, very powerful addiction, right?
[01:56:25.856 --> 01:56:27.898]  I mean, what's that guy said?
[01:56:29.138 --> 01:56:30.699]  Stroke of the pen, law of the land.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.602]  Yeah, I mean, pretty... Stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool.
[01:56:34.722 --> 01:56:39.125]  Yeah, I mean, that amount of power to... I mean, imagine what Obama can do.
[01:56:39.185 --> 01:56:41.227]  What about Obama going, I'm good at killing people.
[01:56:41.772 --> 01:56:46.735]  Yeah, well, you know, he may not like to- I mean, even if you're a real killer, you don't, like, go, I'm really good at killing people.
[01:56:46.855 --> 01:56:51.698]  Yeah, this isn't an ad I've not seen on anyone's business card yet, but Obama, I mean, look at this.
[01:56:51.778 --> 01:56:54.399]  He can pass Obamacare.
[01:56:54.819 --> 01:56:58.982]  He can then add thousands of amendments to it after the fact with no congressional.
[01:56:59.582 --> 01:56:59.982]  Approval.
[01:57:00.042 --> 01:57:01.883]  He can be the savior of his own bill.
[01:57:02.183 --> 01:57:02.403]  Yeah.
[01:57:02.623 --> 01:57:04.003]  He can fix his own problem.
[01:57:04.043 --> 01:57:05.804]  He can, they can hand out waivers?
[01:57:06.444 --> 01:57:08.825]  A direct contradiction of the Constitution.
[01:57:08.845 --> 01:57:09.865]  Total discrimination.
[01:57:09.885 --> 01:57:12.546]  Yeah, supposed to guarantee you equal treatment under the law.
[01:57:12.606 --> 01:57:15.366]  They're handing out thousands of... Those are royal indulgences.
[01:57:15.386 --> 01:57:19.448]  Those are... This is, it's papal middle ages nonsense, right?
[01:57:19.468 --> 01:57:26.009]  So, and that kind of power, you can lie to people and say you'll keep your doctor, and then what are the consequences?
[01:57:26.029 --> 01:57:27.390]  I mean, you lie to the government,
[01:57:28.092 --> 01:57:31.155]  You are going away to a dark hole for a very long time.
[01:57:31.515 --> 01:57:32.736]  The government lies to you.
[01:57:33.137 --> 01:57:35.339]  They get your vote with no negative consequences.
[01:57:35.379 --> 01:57:37.361]  They have no contract with you.
[01:57:37.381 --> 01:57:37.861]  That's right.
[01:57:37.881 --> 01:57:44.608]  When the FBI's been here before with subpoenas for people threatening on the website or something, you know, just side issues, they go talk to me and I go, I cannot talk to you.
[01:57:45.248 --> 01:57:48.189]  Because you always put people in jail saying they gave false answers.
[01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:49.770]  And that's unconstitutional law.
[01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:50.550]  I'm not talking to you.
[01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:51.671]  Well, talk to me.
[01:57:51.731 --> 01:57:52.451]  No, no, you don't understand.
[01:57:52.791 --> 01:57:54.792]  The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk to the government.
[01:57:55.132 --> 01:57:56.512]  The second rule is don't talk to the government.
[01:57:56.772 --> 01:57:58.173]  The third rule is keep your mouth shut.
[01:57:58.433 --> 01:57:59.433]  The fourth rule is shut up.
[01:57:59.974 --> 01:58:00.594]  What's the fifth rule?
[01:58:00.974 --> 01:58:01.875]  Uh, don't talk to the government?
[01:58:01.895 --> 01:58:02.175]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:58:02.195 --> 01:58:03.196]  I'm going to go out on a limb here.
[01:58:03.256 --> 01:58:05.657]  It kind of goes on for, kind of goes for infinity.
[01:58:05.677 --> 01:58:08.839]  The eighth rule, interestingly enough, is don't talk to the government.
[01:58:08.879 --> 01:58:11.281]  But, yeah, so they have no duty to protect you.
[01:58:11.301 --> 01:58:12.582]  They have no duty to control you.
[01:58:12.622 --> 01:58:14.483]  You have no control over your government.
[01:58:14.503 --> 01:58:19.006]  People think that the vote, all you're doing is voting for people already bought and sold by special interests.
[01:58:19.086 --> 01:58:22.448]  You know, they should have those NASCAR stickers all over the congressman by who's bought and sold them.
[01:58:22.488 --> 01:58:24.250]  It's not your interest that they're... Well, that's it!
[01:58:24.330 --> 01:58:30.474]  People in government corporations and all this, they just join their group and then distort everything according to what group they're with.
[01:58:31.094 --> 01:58:39.604]  And I thought I was on Team Humanity, since you'll have a college of ideas where we vote in the free market for what we believe in through free association.
[01:58:39.685 --> 01:58:41.086]  That's what builds a great civilization.
[01:58:41.327 --> 01:58:43.449]  Back with your phone calls in the next hour.
[01:58:43.469 --> 01:58:46.513]  Stay with us.
[01:58:46.593 --> 01:58:47.354]  It's gonna be a doozy.
[01:58:54.016 --> 01:59:03.049]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:11.240]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:16.223]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:59:16.383 --> 01:59:23.108]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:23.168 --> 01:59:30.253]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:59:30.353 --> 01:59:37.218]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:59:37.358 --> 01:59:41.720]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:45.102]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:59:45.242 --> 01:59:51.365]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:59:51.525 --> 01:59:53.786]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:57.087 --> 01:59:59.028]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:59.488 --> 02:00:02.230]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:08.991 --> 02:00:09.631]  Big Brother.
[02:00:10.311 --> 02:00:11.332]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:12.072 --> 02:00:13.172]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:13.832 --> 02:00:14.632]  You want answers?
[02:00:15.412 --> 02:00:16.313]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:16.953 --> 02:00:20.593]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:21.154 --> 02:00:25.234]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.655 --> 02:00:29.355]  By the way, the biggest buzz I've ever heard, I think, is for House of Cards.
[02:00:29.395 --> 02:00:32.116]  I haven't seen it one episode yet, because quite frankly, I'm either
[02:00:32.916 --> 02:00:34.456]  With my family, or I'm working at night.
[02:00:35.037 --> 02:00:36.377]  I just, it's kind of shameful.
[02:00:36.797 --> 02:00:39.098]  All work and no play makes Jack a crazy boy.
[02:00:39.758 --> 02:00:43.939]  But I've got to start watching this because they say the Chinese government's obsessed with it.
[02:00:43.979 --> 02:00:46.219]  It's getting watched like a hundred million times a week or something worldwide.
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.660]  With, well, Kevin Spacey played by me.
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:49.180]  I'm joking.
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:50.321]  People make that joke.
[02:00:50.561 --> 02:00:51.461]  I don't look like Kevin Spacey.
[02:00:51.481 --> 02:00:51.801]  Wish I did.
[02:00:51.821 --> 02:00:53.961]  The point is, is we got Stefan Molyneux here.
[02:00:53.981 --> 02:00:58.343]  We're taking phone calls this segment and the next, but he's going to give us his review of House of Cards.
[02:00:58.383 --> 02:00:59.403]  He's coming up.
[02:00:59.963 --> 02:01:00.483]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:11.877 --> 02:01:16.800]  Yeah, I just wanted to say hi to Steph and I watched that Karl Marx thing, bio that you put together.
[02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:17.380]  Yeah.
[02:01:17.801 --> 02:01:24.225]  Oh, this is Karl Marx basically preying upon the poor and the working class after talking about capitalists being evil for doing the same thing.
[02:01:24.505 --> 02:01:28.587]  He had sex with his maid, had a kid, tossed her out on the street, never paid her a penny.
[02:01:29.328 --> 02:01:36.452]  All the studies that Karl Marx did of the market system at the time, he could never find a worker who wasn't paid anything except in his own house, his maid.
[02:01:36.512 --> 02:01:37.513]  He was the worst exploiter.
[02:01:37.533 --> 02:01:39.014]  I was just pointing out the moral hypocrisy.
[02:01:39.074 --> 02:01:40.975]  Oh, and he was an angel compared to Lenin.
[02:01:41.275 --> 02:01:41.575]  Oh yeah.
[02:01:41.715 --> 02:01:46.556]  Well, he wasn't an outright murderer, Marx, but Lenin was an outright, just savage, genocidal murderer.
[02:01:46.656 --> 02:01:48.197]  I mean, non-stop bloodfests.
[02:01:48.257 --> 02:01:49.217]  But sorry, you can call her.
[02:01:49.237 --> 02:01:50.117]  We don't want to get distracted.
[02:01:50.137 --> 02:01:50.738]  Did you have a question?
[02:01:51.778 --> 02:01:53.558]  Well, yeah, it's kind of funny, though, just real quick.
[02:01:53.618 --> 02:01:54.899]  I wanted to talk about the IRS.
[02:01:55.419 --> 02:01:56.039]  I'm being honest.
[02:01:56.079 --> 02:02:03.921]  But it's funny how these neo-Marxists of today, through osmosis almost, have this same degree of hypocrisy.
[02:02:05.003 --> 02:02:05.924]  That Karl Marx did.
[02:02:06.004 --> 02:02:08.606]  I mean, it's almost, like you said, it drew osmosis from it.
[02:02:08.646 --> 02:02:17.933]  They're bloodthirsty criminals who have grabbed the moral high ground and lectured to everyone when they're exempt from everything they're doing and engage in every dirty trick.
[02:02:17.973 --> 02:02:22.637]  And hey, you try claiming the fifth in an IRS investigation, they'll clap you in irons.
[02:02:23.097 --> 02:02:29.843]  But the hussy up there can be caught lying last year, taking the fifth, does it again, she doesn't get in trouble.
[02:02:30.163 --> 02:02:35.884]  And the IRS is going to be enforcing some aspects of Obamacare, and they are desperate to get out of Obamacare themselves.
[02:02:35.924 --> 02:02:38.085]  They are lobbying like crazy to get out of Obamacare.
[02:02:38.285 --> 02:02:40.945]  Oh yeah, the unions, the government people, they're all going to be exempt.
[02:02:40.985 --> 02:02:41.605]  Oh, it's for us.
[02:02:41.665 --> 02:02:42.585]  It's for us, Alex.
[02:02:42.666 --> 02:02:44.226]  I mean, you know, not for the rulers.
[02:02:44.246 --> 02:02:48.327]  I mean, you don't build, you know, your electric fences around your bedroom if you're the farmer.
[02:02:48.347 --> 02:02:49.287]  It's just for the cows.
[02:02:49.987 --> 02:02:50.267]  Horrible.
[02:02:50.427 --> 02:02:51.127]  Did you have another comment?
[02:02:51.147 --> 02:02:53.408]  That's where I need you guys' help.
[02:02:53.988 --> 02:02:54.888]  I am being audited.
[02:02:55.993 --> 02:02:57.074]  Sorry to hear that.
[02:02:57.415 --> 02:03:00.138]  I was a drywall contractor in Colorado.
[02:03:00.478 --> 02:03:05.364]  My entire livelihood and trade was awarded to illegal aliens.
[02:03:06.105 --> 02:03:06.845]  Put out of business.
[02:03:06.885 --> 02:03:09.108]  My home taken from the murders.
[02:03:09.168 --> 02:03:10.570]  All the value of my property
[02:03:11.505 --> 02:03:33.540]  I know they almost force you with, because again, I'm not even against the illegals, but the point is, you have them here, they'll work for less, their wives go on welfare, they then undermine the cost, you're in the system, the IRS comes and takes you over, you almost have to survive to just start acting like the illegals, get a fake name, pay nothing, operate, do whatever you want, and just sit there in jail when they arrest you for whatever, and they'll just let you out.
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:39.744]  I mean, you can really learn something from the illegals, they're almost the total libertarians, except they then siphon off the state.
[02:03:40.584 --> 02:03:41.665]  What do you say about that, Stefan?
[02:03:42.185 --> 02:03:45.647]  Oh, I mean, American immigration policy since the 60s has been a disaster.
[02:03:45.787 --> 02:03:57.254]  I mean, in the 60s, I mean, and this is the case in other countries, like Australia and so on, they try to bring people in who are educated, who are, at least share some of the common cultural values of the West.
[02:03:57.274 --> 02:04:01.437]  Yeah, I mean, you can't just go and try emigrating to Australia if you're coming from some third world country.
[02:04:02.097 --> 02:04:08.201]  The Democrats, and again, I don't want to sound like I'm pounding on the Democrats, like I'm no Republican, but the Democrats... But they're the virulent cancer.
[02:04:08.221 --> 02:04:10.282]  They are very much bringing in voters.
[02:04:10.282 --> 02:04:10.542]  I don't know.
[02:04:26.963 --> 02:04:30.686]  And then they say, well, now you see we need minimum wage laws to bring the wages back up.
[02:04:31.046 --> 02:04:33.368]  And it's, you know, I'm for open borders.
[02:04:33.388 --> 02:04:35.850]  There's no such thing as, you know, an illegal anybody, right?
[02:04:35.890 --> 02:04:41.955]  But given this policy, it's just a complete... Well, I was about to say, but yeah, you could have open borders worldwide if there wasn't any welfare.
[02:04:42.155 --> 02:04:42.496]  Exactly.
[02:04:42.516 --> 02:04:44.958]  But you have welfare and then let them vote to take my guns?
[02:04:45.038 --> 02:04:45.158]  Yeah.
[02:04:46.141 --> 02:04:49.585]  I mean, literally, they can then vote to make me their slave.
[02:04:49.885 --> 02:04:50.926]  Yeah, and it happens.
[02:04:51.447 --> 02:04:52.888]  It is, that's what democracy is.
[02:04:53.509 --> 02:04:55.511]  Two wolves vote that I'm a sheep, I'm their dinner.
[02:04:56.072 --> 02:04:56.272]  Yeah.
[02:04:56.693 --> 02:04:57.854]  And they want to make me the sheep.
[02:04:59.215 --> 02:05:00.016]  And take my guns.
[02:05:00.817 --> 02:05:01.318]  So I'm a sheep.
[02:05:01.718 --> 02:05:02.279]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:04.235 --> 02:05:05.096]  The facts are in.
[02:05:05.256 --> 02:05:06.397]  The studies are legion.
[02:05:06.657 --> 02:05:14.023]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:05:14.183 --> 02:05:17.645]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:05:18.006 --> 02:05:18.406]  Simple.
[02:05:18.586 --> 02:05:22.969]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:28.734]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:05:29.014 --> 02:05:34.377]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[02:05:34.537 --> 02:05:45.043]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:05:45.323 --> 02:05:47.184]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[02:05:47.304 --> 02:05:49.566]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:05:49.906 --> 02:05:53.089]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots
[02:06:10.382 --> 02:06:11.864]  Over at My Patriot Supply.
[02:06:12.124 --> 02:06:19.993]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:06:20.233 --> 02:06:24.558]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:06:24.779 --> 02:06:28.583]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:06:28.723 --> 02:06:34.428]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:06:34.668 --> 02:06:37.470]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:06:37.851 --> 02:06:43.075]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:06:43.215 --> 02:06:51.342]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[02:07:03.734 --> 02:07:07.078]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:07:07.178 --> 02:07:09.421]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:07:09.601 --> 02:07:14.787]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[02:07:14.907 --> 02:07:17.868]  There are many other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:07:18.168 --> 02:07:28.413]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:07:28.733 --> 02:07:42.039]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:42.519 --> 02:07:48.626]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:08:01.779 --> 02:08:02.640]  InfoWarsLife.com
[02:08:14.033 --> 02:08:15.717]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:16.158 --> 02:08:19.065]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:23.771]  Well, there is a war on for your mind, big time, and I am your host Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.811 --> 02:08:33.873]  The news sites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the subscriber site for the nightly news is PrisonPlanet.tv, and Stefan Mullen is going to be on that show tonight with our great reporters and researchers.
[02:08:34.534 --> 02:08:41.895]  And soon I'm launching the official TV system and expanding the show, and I'll be hosting the show, not just doing commentary like I did last night, most nights of the week.
[02:08:41.935 --> 02:08:44.656]  So, no rest for those that don't want to be wicked.
[02:08:45.376 --> 02:08:48.097]  No rest for those that want to live in the age of reality and want to be free.
[02:08:48.757 --> 02:08:51.800]  But it's an animating contest, it's addictive, so it's like exercise.
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:53.882]  Man, throw me in that briar patch every day.
[02:08:53.962 --> 02:08:56.605]  I got some really bad news for folks, but some good news as well.
[02:08:57.045 --> 02:08:58.507]  The enemy has shown their hand.
[02:08:59.327 --> 02:09:05.653]  We broke off of their sites bragging yesterday that they were about to get Facebook to restrict discussion of the Second Amendment.
[02:09:06.514 --> 02:09:09.735]  That article is Bloomberg moves to ban pro-gun speech.
[02:09:10.696 --> 02:09:15.938]  Facebook now working with the former New York mayor front groups to censor support for Second Amendment.
[02:09:16.438 --> 02:09:18.459]  This just got released an hour ago.
[02:09:18.939 --> 02:09:20.859]  It'll be going up on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.300]  Moms demand action.
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:25.681]  Literally, that's like three people in San Antonio when we had thousands out there.
[02:09:25.701 --> 02:09:28.022]  They tried to start a fight with us on video.
[02:09:28.462 --> 02:09:29.543]  We're going to add that to the article.
[02:09:30.063 --> 02:09:31.463]  This just was released March 5th.
[02:09:31.483 --> 02:09:32.004]  That's today, 2014.
[02:09:33.204 --> 02:09:35.065]  Facebook's announced today that the company
[02:09:36.721 --> 02:09:46.665]  And it's popular photo sharing subsidiary Instagram will take significant steps, remember they arrest kids that draw a picture of a gun at school, to block potentially illegal firearm sales through their platforms.
[02:09:47.106 --> 02:09:48.366]  Now that's meant to sound reasonable.
[02:09:49.086 --> 02:09:56.369]  For the first time the sites will delete reported post, reported by them, offering to buy or sell guns without background checks.
[02:09:56.890 --> 02:09:58.250]  Now people go, well that sounds reasonable.
[02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:59.671]  Then you read deeper.
[02:10:00.936 --> 02:10:08.821]  Anyone with a profile under 18 won't be able to see things about guns or read the word gun so they can have bots that block everything.
[02:10:08.841 --> 02:10:09.682]  This has already happened to us.
[02:10:09.722 --> 02:10:14.085]  We send out a pro-gun meme with like Hitler saying, I love gun control, you know, and stuff like that.
[02:10:14.705 --> 02:10:17.227]  Or people about Benghazi, the Navy SEAL group, they just block it.
[02:10:17.467 --> 02:10:17.607]  Yeah.
[02:10:18.168 --> 02:10:19.549]  And this has been their plan all along.
[02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:22.831]  And you read into the document, it's page after page.
[02:10:24.657 --> 02:10:27.599]  But it says Facebook will continue to report to law enforcement, blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:27.959 --> 02:10:31.561]  Facebook will take down reported pages of groups where guns are sold.
[02:10:32.401 --> 02:10:36.044]  And again, these are groups, gun shops and gun groups that then link to their gun shop.
[02:10:36.464 --> 02:10:37.464]  Guns not being sold there.
[02:10:38.605 --> 02:10:40.126]  They send it to a gun shop and make you buy it.
[02:10:40.746 --> 02:10:47.068]  They create this illusion until the owner of the page acknowledges the page that includes the information prominently at the top of the page.
[02:10:47.448 --> 02:10:54.790]  Facebook's help center will remind sellers that they may conduct background checks for so it's all about you say you will comply with the laws.
[02:10:55.130 --> 02:10:58.291]  They're the new arbiters of free speech online.
[02:10:59.271 --> 02:11:06.538]  Facebook will provide public education ad space targeted at users interested in firearm related content to ensure they know about the gun laws.
[02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:17.128]  So now they'll be Mayor Bloomberg anti-gun, literally brainwashed the public as the Attorney General said, that famous quote, I'm sure you've seen that, targeted at people so they get free advertising now.
[02:11:18.429 --> 02:11:21.752]  And it goes on, it will block people from being able to see the gun sites.
[02:11:21.812 --> 02:11:24.495]  So it gives them free advertising, you name it.
[02:11:27.142 --> 02:11:34.024]  These people always set themselves up, like the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, over law enforcement, where they set all the policies.
[02:11:34.064 --> 02:11:34.584]  They're God.
[02:11:34.904 --> 02:11:36.004]  Rachel Maddow is God.
[02:11:36.485 --> 02:11:40.045]  Well, first of all, I can't imagine Facebook is really enjoying this process.
[02:11:40.265 --> 02:11:43.066]  You know, they say they're working with the New York government or whatever.
[02:11:43.386 --> 02:11:46.427]  That's like me working with a mugger for the orderly transfer of my wallet.
[02:11:46.467 --> 02:11:49.328]  The fact that he has a gun to my ribs is pretty much the whole equation, right?
[02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:50.908]  I mean, what the government can do to business
[02:11:51.588 --> 02:11:52.449]  Uh, is significant.
[02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:57.772]  Uh, I know, I know a lot of businesses use government to, to get rent-seeking, to get comparative advantage and so on.
[02:11:58.172 --> 02:12:02.495]  But if the government comes knocking and says, we'd really like you to work with us, well, they are the guys with all the guns.
[02:12:02.555 --> 02:12:05.917]  And we're, and we've been so compliant, that's what's empowered the beast.
[02:12:06.237 --> 02:12:07.898]  It's time to start not complying.
[02:12:07.998 --> 02:12:21.688]  No, but what's beautiful about this, and we were just talking about this in the break, that I think the government still thinks that they have a monopoly of information distribution, like back in the day when there were like three networks and the government basically controlled or managed or had the license fees for all of these things, right?
[02:12:21.728 --> 02:12:22.989]  Licensed through the FCC.
[02:12:23.690 --> 02:12:32.697]  Now, I mean, what a great way to educate kids about the Second Amendment, because Lord knows with teenagers, like these people have never met a teenager, you go to a teenager and say, you're not allowed to see this.
[02:12:33.666 --> 02:12:35.187]  And it's two clicks away on the internet.
[02:12:35.207 --> 02:12:37.908]  What's the first thing that that... Stay out of the liquor cabinet.
[02:12:37.948 --> 02:12:38.388]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:12:38.788 --> 02:12:41.509]  I mean, I think the average age... Stop chasing cheerleaders.
[02:12:41.649 --> 02:12:45.031]  The average age of kids getting porn these days is 10 to 11 years old.
[02:12:45.111 --> 02:12:48.452]  When it's, you know, not legal until, I don't know, 18 or 19 or something like that, right?
[02:12:48.492 --> 02:12:55.435]  So, it's a beautiful way to get kids interested in the Second Amendment, to have Facebook, Facebook start blocking stuff, because now they're going to get educated about it.
[02:12:55.455 --> 02:12:55.855]  Well, that's it.
[02:12:55.875 --> 02:12:57.516]  They're putting it in the same category as porn.
[02:12:59.144 --> 02:13:15.517]  I mean, it's mad, and it's wonderful how much work the government is doing on behalf of Liberty Advocates in helping the teenagers to understand the power of the state and helping them get interested in topics now taboo, which is, you know, I mean, that's like catnip for a teenager.
[02:13:15.597 --> 02:13:16.278]  Oh, it's taboo!
[02:13:16.338 --> 02:13:17.919]  The powers that be don't want me to see this!
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:20.401]  Here, I'm going to go and find it right away.
[02:13:20.481 --> 02:13:22.383]  I mean, you couldn't advertise education.
[02:13:22.403 --> 02:13:23.403]  Well, listen, they did that.
[02:13:24.264 --> 02:13:27.106]  I actually figured out the reason I was successful
[02:13:28.208 --> 02:13:36.786]  One of the big make-it-or-break-it moments was I put out some documentaries about the military training for martial law, which they do perennially.
[02:13:36.806 --> 02:13:37.628]  They do it all the time.
[02:13:39.724 --> 02:13:42.545]  The military got a hold of these documentaries, Police State 2000 and others.
[02:13:42.605 --> 02:13:43.706]  I was always somewhat successful.
[02:13:44.166 --> 02:13:50.529]  And the Marine Corps and the Army across the board said, do not watch Alex Jones or listen to Alex Jones.
[02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:52.350]  Most of them didn't know who I was.
[02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:56.212]  That's why today, undoubtedly, we are like the number one show in the U.S.
[02:13:56.272 --> 02:13:58.833]  Armed Forces, because they still say, do not listen to him.
[02:13:59.453 --> 02:14:00.774]  Do not listen to Ron Paul.
[02:14:00.854 --> 02:14:03.235]  Do not, do not get involved in the Tea Party.
[02:14:03.775 --> 02:14:05.016]  It's making them all run to it.
[02:14:06.366 --> 02:14:07.307]  What were they thinking?
[02:14:07.627 --> 02:14:09.949]  I mean, they're thinking they have control over the narrative.
[02:14:10.309 --> 02:14:11.831]  The narrative is fragmented.
[02:14:11.851 --> 02:14:14.573]  It used to be a sole control over the narrative, right?
[02:14:14.593 --> 02:14:23.160]  Like, when the Catholic priests spoke the liturgy in Latin in the Middle Ages, and the commoners didn't know Latin, and they couldn't get a hold of the Bible.
[02:14:23.621 --> 02:14:29.766]  And then Martin Luther comes along, translates it into a language they can see, and the monopoly of Christendom then fragments.
[02:14:29.946 --> 02:14:33.787]  Well that's like they'll have MSNBC or others go, Alex Jones has no listeners and is not important and is not on AM and FM stations.
[02:14:57.947 --> 02:15:02.395]  And then people go, look, I'm on over a hundred... But then he doesn't exist, because he's not on media controlled by the government.
[02:15:02.455 --> 02:15:07.264]  But the difference is, I'm on over a hundred and sixty, but we've been more successful in the free market internet.
[02:15:07.565 --> 02:15:09.929]  The point is, is that they lie incessantly.
[02:15:10.663 --> 02:15:10.803]  Yeah.
[02:15:11.003 --> 02:15:15.625]  They lie incessantly, and you're right, they operate like they think they're in a vacuum.
[02:15:15.685 --> 02:15:18.706]  You can lie if nobody can cross-check you, right?
[02:15:18.746 --> 02:15:24.428]  But people don't know, like, my website got banned in the armed services too, and the number of military listeners to my show went through the roof.
[02:15:24.568 --> 02:15:25.409]  That's what I'm telling you!
[02:15:25.429 --> 02:15:29.410]  Didn't they know when they ordered the Pentagon in, like, 99, 2008?
[02:15:30.010 --> 02:15:36.433]  I mean, suddenly I had this giant audience, and suddenly I was being given all this info that turned out to be accurate.
[02:15:37.193 --> 02:15:39.114]  People leaking, you know, just basic stuff.
[02:15:39.134 --> 02:15:40.795]  Not like secrets, but what was going on.
[02:15:41.835 --> 02:15:43.996]  They didn't like the training they were being given to take on Americans.
[02:15:44.437 --> 02:15:45.697]  They heard a guy saying it was bad.
[02:15:45.977 --> 02:15:47.198]  They knew I was telling the truth.
[02:15:47.478 --> 02:15:48.939]  Then they're told, don't listen to this guy.
[02:15:49.639 --> 02:15:54.101]  Then they come in and say, you're gonna get run or get PT duty if we find any more of these films here.
[02:15:54.702 --> 02:15:56.102]  Suddenly, everyone was watching them.
[02:15:56.342 --> 02:15:57.723]  Yeah.
[02:15:57.763 --> 02:15:59.404]  I mean, what was the system thinking?
[02:15:59.524 --> 02:16:03.226]  It's the delusion of control that the technology has by- It's the Streisand effect.
[02:16:03.908 --> 02:16:04.409]  I'm sorry, what now?
[02:16:22.205 --> 02:16:23.045]  What you're saying is true.
[02:16:23.806 --> 02:16:29.387]  Well, they inhabit the state, which is an institution that is so ancient it's ridiculous.
[02:16:29.407 --> 02:16:32.608]  It's just an outgrowth of warlords and witch doctors from the Stone Age.
[02:16:33.229 --> 02:16:37.150]  They inhabit the state, which is retro, and they have had so much monopoly control.
[02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:43.932]  Over the media, that I think that they still don't quite grasp just how porous information has become now.
[02:16:43.952 --> 02:16:44.092]  Sure.
[02:16:44.152 --> 02:16:49.753]  And how, I mean, you know, it's like you put a tiny pebble in a stream and you think you're damming the whole stream.
[02:16:49.813 --> 02:16:51.034]  No, everything just goes around it.
[02:16:51.114 --> 02:16:53.635]  I mean, there's no rock big enough to dam the floor.
[02:16:53.655 --> 02:16:54.535]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:16:54.635 --> 02:17:01.877]  I learned early on with stalkers or people in the media that make stuff up who wanted attention, smaller people than me making stuff up, don't respond, they go away.
[02:17:02.217 --> 02:17:05.018]  You give them attention, it gives them attention, they do it more.
[02:17:05.238 --> 02:17:05.358]  Yeah.
[02:17:06.688 --> 02:17:07.329]  And, I mean, that's 101.
[02:17:08.129 --> 02:17:09.250]  I'm not that smart, I know that.
[02:17:09.591 --> 02:17:11.032]  How can the system not know that?
[02:17:12.093 --> 02:17:15.515]  Well, remember, they're also playing to an older audience.
[02:17:15.615 --> 02:17:21.160]  I think younger people are much more open to principled ideas of freedom than older people, to some degree, to some degree.
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:28.786]  And I think what they're doing is they're playing to an audience that themselves do not understand how widely porous the flow of information has become.
[02:17:29.166 --> 02:17:32.849]  So what they're saying, the people are saying, well, we don't want our kids seeing these Second Amendment things.
[02:17:32.909 --> 02:17:35.251]  It's like, well, we just, we talk to Facebook and it's taken care of.
[02:17:35.291 --> 02:17:35.812]  And people are like,
[02:17:36.272 --> 02:17:42.597]  Hey, I'm over 50, that sounds plausible to me, because, you know, when they weren't allowed to show it on TV, they weren't allowed to show it on TV and nobody knew about it.
[02:17:42.697 --> 02:17:50.942]  Or when it wasn't allowed... Yeah, don't they get by banning Super Bowl ads that are pro-gun, by arresting kids that draw a picture of a gun at school, they only make it sexier?
[02:17:50.982 --> 02:17:57.887]  Because let me tell you, with the liberal trendies, the sexiest thing now is to go square dancing, two-stepping, buy guns, become a hillbilly.
[02:17:58.748 --> 02:18:00.429]  We're actually winning with the young liberals.
[02:18:00.449 --> 02:18:01.850]  They're waking up and becoming libertarians.
[02:18:02.371 --> 02:18:02.531]  Yeah.
[02:18:02.711 --> 02:18:05.513]  I don't know what's going to happen for the power structure, because it's not going well.
[02:18:05.993 --> 02:18:11.401]  Well the other thing too is that I think people, the government control of the schools have become so complete, so absolute.
[02:18:11.421 --> 02:18:15.427]  This started in the 60s when you could no longer fire teachers and it just became so absolute.
[02:18:16.228 --> 02:18:22.056]  And I don't think people really remember or understand that when young people think of the state, they think of the school.
[02:18:22.817 --> 02:18:26.942]  And the experiences they have in the school are so uniformly negative these days.
[02:18:26.982 --> 02:18:28.343]  I mean, it was pretty bad when I was a kid.
[02:18:28.364 --> 02:18:29.365]  No, it was horrible when I was a kid.
[02:18:29.385 --> 02:18:31.027]  Yeah, but it's become even worse now.
[02:18:31.367 --> 02:18:36.252]  Like, I mean, in the 30 years since I was in high school, I mean, it's become exponentially worse.
[02:18:36.313 --> 02:18:39.356]  Like now, as you know, they're built by the same people who build prisons.
[02:18:39.436 --> 02:18:40.998]  It's a mind-control facility.
[02:18:41.178 --> 02:18:43.181]  Yeah, it is a prison.
[02:18:43.341 --> 02:18:45.624]  It is an actual prison that you're forced to go to.
[02:18:46.124 --> 02:18:49.609]  And so I think the government is used to this patriotic blah blah blah.
[02:18:49.649 --> 02:18:53.754]  But teenagers now understand that it's the government that runs their lives as teenagers.
[02:18:53.814 --> 02:18:55.276]  It's the government that makes them go to school.
[02:18:55.296 --> 02:18:57.018]  And they're rebelling against mommy and daddy now.
[02:18:57.238 --> 02:18:58.740]  But the state is their mommy and daddy.
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:00.122]  They're going to rebel against the state.
[02:19:00.362 --> 02:19:01.162]  Raised by the state.
[02:19:01.182 --> 02:19:04.484]  They've been put in state institutions from about the age of three or four onwards.
[02:19:04.864 --> 02:19:09.927]  And so when the state tells them stuff, all the rebellion that used to go to mom and dad in the fifties is now going to the state.
[02:19:09.967 --> 02:19:11.527]  What a beautiful situation to be in.
[02:19:11.567 --> 02:19:18.111]  What a great, fomenting, wonderful lava pool we've got to inject some reason and passion into and to wake people up.
[02:19:18.151 --> 02:19:20.472]  Because for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:19:20.772 --> 02:19:23.553]  Hey, imagine if high school went on forever.
[02:19:23.593 --> 02:19:25.114]  Well, welcome to the modern government.
[02:19:25.154 --> 02:19:29.336]  You know, boy, if that doesn't make... You know, I have a recurring nightmare that I still have where I'm back in high school.
[02:19:30.237 --> 02:19:32.519]  Do you still have that one where you didn't study for some test?
[02:19:32.539 --> 02:19:33.880]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:19:34.141 --> 02:19:37.464]  I'll be like, the nightmare is I'm 30 as a senior.
[02:19:38.044 --> 02:19:39.566]  And I'm like, my God, I'm an idiot.
[02:19:39.886 --> 02:19:40.847]  I've got to get out of here.
[02:19:41.148 --> 02:19:41.928]  That's a great line.
[02:19:41.948 --> 02:19:43.230]  Do the rest of the hour with us.
[02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:44.251]  You got some lunch coming for you.
[02:19:44.271 --> 02:19:46.072]  We're going to come back, I promise, and go to Fred.
[02:19:47.054 --> 02:19:48.856]  And go to Dave, you've been Real Troopers.
[02:19:49.316 --> 02:19:53.199]  And go to Todd, Robert, and another, Fred and Todd.
[02:19:53.519 --> 02:19:55.381]  And then we're gonna get your review of House of Cards.
[02:19:55.401 --> 02:19:55.881]  Yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:19:56.161 --> 02:19:57.522]  Stefan Molyneux is our guest.
[02:19:57.583 --> 02:19:58.343]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:59.324 --> 02:20:00.525]  Freedom Domain Radio.
[02:20:00.805 --> 02:20:01.546]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:04.949 --> 02:20:06.350]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[02:20:06.470 --> 02:20:09.152]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[02:20:09.312 --> 02:20:13.995]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[02:20:14.156 --> 02:20:19.339]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.
[02:20:19.479 --> 02:20:26.084]  My Magic Mud is a soft powder that polishes your teeth, reduces sensitivity, and removes harmful toxins from deep inside your mouth.
[02:20:26.184 --> 02:20:28.126]  You deserve a bright, healthy smile.
[02:20:28.186 --> 02:20:30.627]  Visit MyMagicMud.com and get yours today.
[02:20:30.747 --> 02:20:32.609]  That's MyMagicMud.com.
[02:20:34.076 --> 02:20:37.498]  We are not here to scare you, or fill your mind with images of terror.
[02:20:37.758 --> 02:20:38.919]  There's enough of that already.
[02:20:39.259 --> 02:20:42.541]  We are SurvivalBagsInc.com, a veteran-owned company.
[02:20:43.002 --> 02:20:45.603]  We specialize in survival supplies, bags, and packs.
[02:20:46.023 --> 02:20:53.808]  In most cases, our survival bags, loaded with emergency food, water, and supplies, ship out in 24 hours or less, and prices start as low as 60 bucks.
[02:20:54.208 --> 02:20:58.651]  Go to SurvivalBagsInc.com, and thank you for supporting a veteran-owned American business.
[02:20:59.071 --> 02:21:00.612]  SurvivalBagsInc.com.
[02:21:01.053 --> 02:21:02.754]  Our mission is to help you survive.
[02:21:04.878 --> 02:21:08.439]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:12.281]  Criminals know that your doors are weak and your alarm system can't keep them out.
[02:21:14.062 --> 02:21:17.683]  That's the sound of the same door, now protected by the Door Sentinel.
[02:21:17.803 --> 02:21:20.844]  Standard locks, deadbolts, and alarm systems can't prevent forced entry.
[02:21:20.964 --> 02:21:23.345]  Harden your door and door jam with the Door Sentinel.

[02:21:33.189 --> 02:21:34.309]  Attention gun owners.
[02:21:34.569 --> 02:21:39.251]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[02:21:39.351 --> 02:21:42.812]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[02:21:43.052 --> 02:21:45.213]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.
[02:21:45.433 --> 02:21:47.593]  Is civilian legal in all 50 states.
[02:21:47.853 --> 02:21:50.134]  Is 100% made in the USA.
[02:21:50.274 --> 02:21:53.875]  Is veteran owned and ships next business day for free.
[02:21:54.035 --> 02:21:56.556]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:21:56.696 --> 02:21:59.517]  I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:21:59.657 --> 02:22:00.797]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:22:01.338 --> 02:22:02.558]  Just won't quit.
[02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:05.890]  Time and time again.
[02:22:06.250 --> 02:22:08.732]  You need to come here and help us.
[02:22:08.832 --> 02:22:09.913]  We need assistance.
[02:22:10.273 --> 02:22:10.834]  Please!
[02:22:11.094 --> 02:22:14.396]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[02:22:14.676 --> 02:22:20.761]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:22:21.061 --> 02:22:23.403]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[02:22:23.583 --> 02:22:29.929]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster with MyPatriotsupply.com.

[02:22:55.536 --> 02:22:59.942]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com
[02:23:02.534 --> 02:23:12.841]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:23:13.141 --> 02:23:15.002]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:23:15.202 --> 02:23:15.883]  Fluoride!
[02:23:16.083 --> 02:23:17.644]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:23:17.984 --> 02:23:24.289]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:23:24.529 --> 02:23:29.312]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:23:29.432 --> 02:23:32.534]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[02:23:32.794 --> 02:23:33.415]  We're good.
[02:24:16.941 --> 02:24:29.268]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:24:29.328 --> 02:24:35.171]  We're going to give you Stefan Molyneux's take on House of Cards that I have not yet watched, but everyone keeps telling me about, so...
[02:24:36.867 --> 02:24:42.751]  Most propaganda is in movies and TV, not in the news, and I'm kind of blind because I only focus on news.
[02:24:42.831 --> 02:24:49.015]  I should focus more on the propaganda in films, but that discussion coming up in the next segment after calls.
[02:24:49.116 --> 02:24:50.917]  Fred in Wisconsin, you're a trooper for holding.
[02:24:51.237 --> 02:24:52.398]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:24:52.438 --> 02:24:52.818]  Go ahead.
[02:24:54.219 --> 02:25:01.224]  Hey Alex, I wanted to ask you and your guest, you have an uncanny ability to predict the future based on the events going on right now.
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:16.668]  And I see all these young people in California signing up for these medical marijuana cards, and I see it spreading across the United States, and I believe that if legalization happens, if it really does come across,
[02:25:17.452 --> 02:25:30.266]  That this is going to lead to gun confiscation later and that all these databases are being built because it's still against the federal law to have a gun and be under the influence of marijuana regardless of what the states say.
[02:25:30.286 --> 02:25:34.350]  I think it's going to be a big problem and I didn't get my first gun until I was 25.
[02:25:36.858 --> 02:25:42.822]  I think it's just going to lead to a future gun confiscation problem, especially if they lose all the money.
[02:25:43.023 --> 02:25:43.643]  Sure, sure.
[02:25:43.723 --> 02:25:46.065]  And I want to be clear about this whole gun issue.
[02:25:46.545 --> 02:25:58.994]  The guns are important, but the reason we obsess on it is when they come to try to take them, it's because they're going to take the First Amendment, the Fourth, the Tenth, everything else, which just symbolize rights that were already inalienable and already existed.
[02:25:59.695 --> 02:26:04.779]  And the point is, is that they go, oh, we're friends, just let us register them, and then they always confiscate them.
[02:26:05.439 --> 02:26:08.100]  And so yes, undoubtedly the plan is to take our guns.
[02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:11.341]  But as Stefan said, so they have the monopoly.
[02:26:11.621 --> 02:26:12.881]  What's a bank robber do when he comes in?
[02:26:12.901 --> 02:26:15.462]  He says, hands up, and he takes the gun away from the security guard.
[02:26:15.962 --> 02:26:16.822]  I mean, that's what they're doing.
[02:26:16.842 --> 02:26:19.863]  They're securing what they've hijacked, what they've usurped.
[02:26:20.223 --> 02:26:23.164]  And I, at an instinctive level, do not want to be usurped.
[02:26:23.204 --> 02:26:23.524]  Stefan?
[02:26:24.602 --> 02:26:27.563]  You know that the system is about to crash when they try to grab the guns.
[02:26:28.144 --> 02:26:29.464]  That is always what happens.
[02:26:29.884 --> 02:26:33.326]  Because when the system crashes, the dependent classes get kind of angry.
[02:26:33.686 --> 02:26:34.687]  Where's the welfare check?
[02:26:34.727 --> 02:26:36.387]  Where's the social security check?
[02:26:36.787 --> 02:26:38.988]  My money's being inflated right out of my bank account.
[02:26:39.028 --> 02:26:39.969]  I can't buy food.
[02:26:39.989 --> 02:26:41.790]  I mean, this is what happened in Ukraine.
[02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:46.312]  Ukraine, the average GDP per person is like $3,500 or $4,000 compared to Poland, which is $30,000 or $40,000 because they've got such a corrupt regime.
[02:26:51.614 --> 02:26:55.315]  The Arab Spring was because the price of wheat went up three times, they couldn't afford to eat.
[02:26:55.755 --> 02:27:03.337]  So when you've got a dependent class, which has been fostered for the last 30 years, when you're about to run out of money, you've got to grab those guns.
[02:27:03.497 --> 02:27:06.838]  Otherwise, you could be facing some significant... And I want to explain something.
[02:27:06.958 --> 02:27:14.100]  It is massive centralization that allows runs on banks, that allows starvation, that allows deflation, inflation.
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:20.903]  If you have a truly diverse, free, multi-crop economy, you have some problems, but you just get richer and richer.
[02:27:21.303 --> 02:27:22.043]  History shows.
[02:27:22.543 --> 02:27:31.907]  The problem is ever getting to that point where you get government and regulators out of your hair and have a virtuous society, then it's like a perpetual motion machine.
[02:27:32.247 --> 02:27:33.407]  But again, then you become decadent.
[02:27:33.447 --> 02:27:34.248]  It's the same cycle.
[02:27:34.308 --> 02:27:34.928]  Anything else, Caller?
[02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:40.050]  I would just keep my name off that list as long as possible to see what they actually do.
[02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:42.111]  Well, yeah, I mean, folks, you can get guns.
[02:27:43.343 --> 02:27:44.183]  Anywhere in the U.S.
[02:27:44.203 --> 02:27:46.444]  without getting them through a registration system.
[02:27:46.484 --> 02:27:48.704]  In most areas it's legal to buy from a private seller.
[02:27:49.224 --> 02:27:52.085]  Me, I'm so prominent anyways, I go buy guns at the background check.
[02:27:52.105 --> 02:27:52.725]  Why do I care?
[02:27:53.885 --> 02:27:56.465]  I don't think I even have hardly any guns that I bought from friends or family.
[02:27:57.245 --> 02:27:59.366]  And they can say anything's illegal too, nitpicking it.
[02:27:59.426 --> 02:28:02.586]  You know, it's... The cops show up and say, you know, you have a gun illegally.
[02:28:02.646 --> 02:28:03.087]  No, I don't.
[02:28:03.507 --> 02:28:06.167]  I don't have your, you know, your view that my gun's illegal.
[02:28:06.187 --> 02:28:08.648]  Because my grandpa gave it to me 30 years ago.
[02:28:08.688 --> 02:28:10.988]  You know, they can frame anything the way they want it to.
[02:28:12.267 --> 02:28:21.273]  Yeah, and I would strongly suggest that it's a great barometer of an economic catastrophe when the escalation of gun grabbing goes on.
[02:28:21.293 --> 02:28:25.136]  That's the time where you've got to start thinking about whatever savings you've got, whatever finances you've got.
[02:28:25.156 --> 02:28:27.337]  That's right, they're going to take everything else when they go for the guns.
[02:28:27.417 --> 02:28:29.219]  Robert and Mass, you're on the air.
[02:28:29.259 --> 02:28:30.419]  It's the canary in the coal mine.
[02:28:30.459 --> 02:28:31.040]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:28:32.021 --> 02:28:32.581]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:28:33.061 --> 02:28:33.722]  I'm good, go ahead.
[02:28:33.742 --> 02:28:36.424]  I just want to say you're doing a great job.
[02:28:36.444 --> 02:28:39.285]  You're a true American patriot and a spirit of 76 lives on.
[02:28:39.706 --> 02:28:40.246]  Thank you, brother.
[02:28:40.266 --> 02:28:41.287]  What's your question or comment?
[02:28:42.042 --> 02:28:45.085]  Well, my question is about, first, the IRS.
[02:28:45.305 --> 02:28:46.666]  It's not a question, it's just a point.
[02:28:46.766 --> 02:28:51.110]  I'm from Massachusetts, so we're under a form of Obamacare here already.
[02:28:51.130 --> 02:29:05.263]  And just to back up what you stated, that they are going to go after your bank accounts, they are going to go after your tax returns, that's already happening here in Massachusetts if you don't cover yourself for the year when you go to file your taxes and they take it out of your tax return.
[02:29:07.737 --> 02:29:22.763]  My other point is, I'm a kind of hands-on guy, I like to get in people's faces, I call senators, I call congressmen on gun control, I call CNN, I call MSNBC, just to let these people know that there are people out there who do care about the Constitution.
[02:29:22.863 --> 02:29:28.126]  Oh, there are a lot of people that care, but you know the bill, and now the IRS announced last week they're going to take the money out of your bank account.
[02:29:29.026 --> 02:29:31.368]  And they go, but Obama promised they wouldn't.
[02:29:31.668 --> 02:29:35.312]  Well, why do they have it in there to take $5,000 out then if they're not going to do it?
[02:29:35.892 --> 02:29:39.255]  But a politician promised is such a non-argument.
[02:29:39.315 --> 02:29:41.617]  I can't believe people... Caller, did you have anything else you wanted to add?
[02:29:42.403 --> 02:29:49.168]  I just wanted to say what an excellent guest you have on and his take on what he thinks it's going to take for the American people to finally have enough.
[02:29:49.288 --> 02:29:49.628]  That's right.
[02:29:50.109 --> 02:29:51.830]  Will there be a big flashpoint or will it be gradual?
[02:29:51.850 --> 02:29:52.911]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[02:30:04.065 --> 02:30:09.653]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:30:09.854 --> 02:30:17.084]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:30:17.244 --> 02:30:20.429]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:30:20.589 --> 02:30:22.390]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:27.194]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:30:27.274 --> 02:30:30.036]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:30:30.176 --> 02:30:35.980]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:39.622]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:30:39.822 --> 02:30:44.886]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[02:30:45.086 --> 02:30:47.728]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:48.288 --> 02:30:54.157]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[02:31:09.997 --> 02:31:14.381]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:31:14.521 --> 02:31:20.526]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.

[02:32:02.081 --> 02:32:04.981]  The facts are in.
[02:32:05.161 --> 02:32:06.302]  The studies are legion.
[02:32:06.562 --> 02:32:13.924]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:32:14.064 --> 02:32:17.505]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:32:17.905 --> 02:32:18.305]  Simple.
[02:32:18.465 --> 02:32:22.908]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:32:23.188 --> 02:32:28.652]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:32:28.912 --> 02:32:44.902]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, using six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:49.466]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:32:49.806 --> 02:32:51.648]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[02:32:51.968 --> 02:32:57.253]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:32:57.513 --> 02:33:01.777]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:33:01.917 --> 02:33:03.719]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:33:14.764 --> 02:33:18.213]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:18.854 --> 02:33:20.779]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.751 --> 02:33:32.872]  Freedomainradio.com is his website.
[02:33:32.892 --> 02:33:33.512]  Stefan Molyneux.
[02:33:33.532 --> 02:33:46.377]  We're going to continue with your phone calls with Todd and everybody else that's holding after we do our review of House of Cards that I've not watched yet, but I know this whole global system is a House of Cards, that when it comes down, we don't want to be crushed by.
[02:33:46.397 --> 02:33:56.460]  That's what this is all about, is putting out our ideas so that when it all collapses, people know that we were right, and there's an alternative to this system that we've been under, and we could have a new renaissance, a new enlightenment.
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:57.841]  Before I go any further,
[02:33:58.701 --> 02:34:02.944]  We have some amazing specials going right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:34:02.964 --> 02:34:09.629]  We have the entire family of Pro-Pure, Pro-1, 2.0 systems that cut out the fluoride, the glyphosates.
[02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:15.033]  I carry the Pro-Pure systems because it's the best gravity-fed stainless steel system out there.
[02:34:15.454 --> 02:34:22.299]  It blows the competition away, side-by-side comparisons, and it costs the same or less as its leading competitor.
[02:34:22.839 --> 02:34:32.963]  Pro 1 available at InfowarsStore.com and stop drinking the Roundup, stop drinking the hydrofluorosilicic acid and the BPA and all the crap that's in the water.
[02:34:33.223 --> 02:34:37.105]  Whether you got well water, you name it, rain water, you need to filter your water.
[02:34:37.145 --> 02:34:40.246]  It's a win-win and it funds this operation, our free speech.
[02:34:40.606 --> 02:34:43.888]  It does tens of thousands of gallons for the smaller filters, even more with the bigger ones.
[02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:50.891]  They've got a pitcher model that is incredibly inexpensive, the same price as a charcoal filter that doesn't cut anything out, just flavor.
[02:34:51.471 --> 02:34:52.932]  Cuts out, you know, bad stuff that tastes bad.
[02:34:52.952 --> 02:34:55.314]  This has filters in it that actually cuts it all out.
[02:34:55.734 --> 02:34:57.655]  It's just an amazing system.
[02:34:57.915 --> 02:35:00.877]  You know, I didn't sell filters for a couple of years just because I couldn't find them that were good enough.
[02:35:01.398 --> 02:35:09.203]  We'd have customer service complaints, problems, I don't know what was going on, but we carry a couple brands, Pro1's the best, that we've gotten great reviews from and that I use.
[02:35:09.223 --> 02:35:12.906]  We have the LifeStraw at the lowest price that we're allowed to advertise it for.
[02:35:13.366 --> 02:35:15.267]  And your purchase makes the transmission possible.
[02:35:15.568 --> 02:35:20.231]  So all your water filter needs, InfowarsStore.com or call toll-free.
[02:35:22.655 --> 02:35:22.855]  888-253-3139.

[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:34.942]  Not a gun to your head like the IRS taking your money and giving it to state-run media.
[02:35:35.202 --> 02:35:36.763]  We're here saying, hey, we carry great products.
[02:35:37.163 --> 02:35:38.144]  If you believe in them, buy them.
[02:35:38.164 --> 02:35:39.885]  If you believe in what we're doing, support us.
[02:35:39.965 --> 02:35:46.349]  I mean, take the Super Mel Vitality with eight concentrated organic herbs known to help block estrogen mimicers.
[02:35:46.929 --> 02:35:48.470]  I mean, people take it, they're just completely blown away.
[02:35:48.490 --> 02:35:51.793]  I mean, look at me, I was like a fat slob, and I still am somewhat of a job of the hut.
[02:35:51.833 --> 02:35:56.156]  I mean, I got a little bit of a potbelly left, folks, but I mean, I've lost a ton of weight.
[02:35:56.176 --> 02:35:56.897]  Everybody can see it.
[02:35:57.357 --> 02:36:01.981]  I mean, I'm in here, camera adds 10 pounds to you, but I mean, I'm getting ready to take some photos with the shirt off, folks.
[02:36:02.021 --> 02:36:05.624]  I've lost a ton of weight, and it's given me the stamina, the energy to do it.
[02:36:06.224 --> 02:36:09.347]  Along with the other great supplements we have at Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:10.148 --> 02:36:10.628]  15% off.
[02:36:10.648 --> 02:36:13.430]  We're still running that special because it's been so popular.
[02:36:13.450 --> 02:36:14.912]  We sold out, but more came in.
[02:36:14.932 --> 02:36:16.813]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:17.033 --> 02:36:18.715]  It's always on the same store.
[02:36:18.735 --> 02:36:19.796]  Just that takes you right to it.
[02:36:20.156 --> 02:36:22.778]  Infowarslife.com on Infowarsstore.com.

[02:36:28.364 --> 02:36:37.393]  And regardless, when you get the survival shield, the fluoride shield, detoxifier, the super male vitality, all of it, it funds our operation so you win, period.
[02:36:37.933 --> 02:36:39.115]  Through free association.
[02:36:39.635 --> 02:36:40.396]  That's what it's all about.
[02:36:40.756 --> 02:36:43.119]  Voting for organic food by buying organic food.
[02:36:43.479 --> 02:36:46.942]  You then displace all the inorganic food to where those people are going bankrupt.
[02:36:48.003 --> 02:36:53.167]  It's the power of voting with choice, and that's what we rely on and what has sustained us.
[02:36:53.548 --> 02:37:01.093]  And while the system is trying to wreck the free market, the remnants of it, it's still empowering civilization and society.
[02:37:01.153 --> 02:37:08.059]  So, you can also call the toll-free number for any questions, or to order via telephone, the t-shirts, the books, the films, the Molon Labe, 888-325-7000.
[02:37:09.940 --> 02:37:10.740]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9-8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:20.784]  And when you go over and watch the podcast with Stefan Molyneux on his site, that's supporting the free market of ideas.
[02:37:20.804 --> 02:37:30.608]  When you pass on his podcast, when you pass on our podcast, when you tell friends and family about the different radio shows and books, all of that is little individual actions.
[02:37:30.828 --> 02:37:31.988]  We're not in some vacuum.
[02:37:32.008 --> 02:37:38.231]  We're just the kleptocrats and people that think in gang mentality, who aren't creative and gang up to rob us that are creative.
[02:37:39.211 --> 02:37:41.314]  We're better than them when we take the field.
[02:37:42.315 --> 02:37:43.256]  Our ideas win.
[02:37:43.396 --> 02:37:44.277]  I've experienced it.
[02:37:45.198 --> 02:37:48.681]  And there are a lot more articulate, better folks than me out there who just don't have confidence in themselves.
[02:37:48.961 --> 02:37:51.104]  I've been on there 19 years from nowhere, folks.
[02:37:51.504 --> 02:37:54.467]  With Free Association, we reach 3 million people.
[02:37:54.507 --> 02:37:55.488]  That's a conservative number.
[02:37:55.929 --> 02:37:56.609]  Every day.
[02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.851]  And we're growing.
[02:37:59.342 --> 02:38:02.766]  And freedom is popular, and we can legalize freedom, as Ron Paul says.
[02:38:03.146 --> 02:38:04.688]  We can have a debate about what freedom is.
[02:38:05.028 --> 02:38:07.530]  Total anarchic capitalism, like Stefan Molyneux?
[02:38:07.570 --> 02:38:09.833]  Or me just saying, hey, I want my republic back.
[02:38:09.893 --> 02:38:11.734]  It's better than being run by foreign banks.
[02:38:12.415 --> 02:38:15.618]  Just don't blame the republic, as they do, for what our society's turned into.
[02:38:15.978 --> 02:38:21.244]  Now, I'm going to go back to calls, but if you want to comment on voting with our dollars, I'd like to get that, and then... I've never heard.
[02:38:22.486 --> 02:38:23.206]  Such a buzz.
[02:38:24.187 --> 02:38:27.468]  It's about House of Cards and people on the street going, it's what you say about them.
[02:38:27.888 --> 02:38:33.610]  I don't know how it's on Netflix, but that shows the model of a Netflix platform, five years old, dominating everything.
[02:38:33.630 --> 02:38:35.911]  A hundred million viewers a week, that show alone.
[02:38:36.551 --> 02:38:39.432]  I keep telling people, don't try to go to Hollywood to be successful.
[02:38:39.692 --> 02:38:44.854]  Go make your own film with passion, and it'll pay for itself, and the next film will make money.
[02:38:45.274 --> 02:38:46.775]  But so many people just want to go
[02:38:47.615 --> 02:38:56.463]  Make it and be rich with no passion, and then there'll be a bling-bling hip-hop star, or there'll be a movie star, not getting that the journey is the destination.
[02:38:56.884 --> 02:39:02.209]  So, House of Cards with a 9.0 rating on IMDb, almost unheard of.
[02:39:02.609 --> 02:39:04.151]  What is your take on this phenomenon?
[02:39:04.915 --> 02:39:06.176]  Well, it's free market art.
[02:39:06.577 --> 02:39:09.259]  It's art without a license, because it's coming through Netflix.
[02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:11.842]  There's no FCC, there's nothing like that.
[02:39:12.342 --> 02:39:21.712]  And I had a guy talking about a good documentary called Divorce Corps, about family courts and just how unbelievably predation, what predation they have, particularly on the American male and the divorce situation.
[02:39:22.032 --> 02:39:27.437]  And he was pointing out, like, no TV studio can accurately portray judicial corruption.
[02:39:28.058 --> 02:39:32.862]  Because networks are getting sued all the time, and the last thing they want to do is piss off judges.
[02:39:32.882 --> 02:39:36.525]  They're going to sit in front of some judge who's going to remember them and judge against them, right?
[02:39:36.965 --> 02:39:47.514]  So this is Netflix streaming directly through the internet, bypassing the FCC, bypassing the regulators, and so they can put out an honest-to-goodness portrayal of, I think, what politics looks like.
[02:39:47.554 --> 02:39:49.256]  You compare this to something like the West Wing.
[02:39:49.956 --> 02:39:56.699]  Which was Aaron Sorkin's drama about Democrats in the White House, which was state-humping demo porn from, you know, a couple of decades ago.
[02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:59.981]  This is the true face of politics.
[02:40:00.041 --> 02:40:04.463]  This is the backstabbing, the evil, the monstrosity, the hypocrisy.
[02:40:04.483 --> 02:40:11.287]  I mean, it's like Othello, where you had Iago as the bad guy, making Othello into a bad guy, but there's no good guy in this whole thing.
[02:40:11.527 --> 02:40:12.547]  And it's the Democrats!
[02:40:13.167 --> 02:40:17.910]  Because normally you get left-wing writers, if they have to portray bad people in politics, they make them Republicans.
[02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:25.634]  But these are Democrats and it is showing just how corrupt the system is, how unsustainable the system is.
[02:40:26.414 --> 02:40:30.857]  And it's not even backroom deals for the sake of any advancing agenda.
[02:40:30.937 --> 02:40:35.500]  It's not like they want to do good things and they have to regretfully do bad things to get those good things going.
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:40.382]  They only pretend they want to do good things in order to advance their own personal power and agenda.
[02:40:40.422 --> 02:40:41.923]  And I think that is an accurate view.
[02:40:41.963 --> 02:40:44.685]  And I think it's going to really color and condition
[02:40:45.345 --> 02:40:51.391]  Particularly young people's view of what it is to be in politics and what the government really looks like from the inside.
[02:40:51.451 --> 02:40:52.652]  I think it's very powerful.
[02:40:52.912 --> 02:40:54.053]  But you said it yourself.
[02:40:54.674 --> 02:40:57.576]  I talked to a lot of people that say, man, this is really accurate.
[02:40:57.596 --> 02:41:00.299]  And by the way, this is what you're saying about the government, Alex.
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:06.404]  It's a sign that the whole wall of Hollywood control is imploding.
[02:41:06.444 --> 02:41:14.071]  I was talking about this the last few months, and I've had a lot of big Hollywood people and rock stars contact me and say, man, you don't know how true what you're saying is.
[02:41:14.551 --> 02:41:21.737]  When I'm out in Hollywood, and I've been to a lot of big A-list parties and stuff back when I would even go do that, now I realize nothing ever really comes of it, so why go out there?
[02:41:21.757 --> 02:41:25.881]  Because I used to go out there to be on big national TV shows, and that doesn't really do anything, so what's the point?
[02:41:27.611 --> 02:41:29.232]  I would go out there and people weren't liberal.
[02:41:29.272 --> 02:41:30.173]  They weren't conservative.
[02:41:30.553 --> 02:41:31.594]  They were libertarian.
[02:41:31.714 --> 02:41:32.954]  They know the systems of fraud.
[02:41:33.215 --> 02:41:34.475]  They want freedom for their kids.
[02:41:34.736 --> 02:41:35.896]  They know GMO's bad.
[02:41:36.237 --> 02:41:39.278]  They're liberal on some issues, conservative on others, those traditional issues.
[02:41:39.559 --> 02:41:46.943]  They've all got guns, even if they claim they're anti-gun, because the studio won't put you on if you don't toe the line.
[02:41:47.304 --> 02:41:48.925]  And the few people that would come on my show
[02:41:49.645 --> 02:41:53.548]  Literally would get called in and told, you're never going to work again if you don't stop that.
[02:41:53.949 --> 02:41:57.972]  If you want to be part of a libertarian group, you've got to be literally in a secret society in Hollywood.
[02:41:58.332 --> 02:42:13.324]  But the truth is, because they haven't let them be libertarian, or what they call conspiracy theorists, people that question known liars, the hottest thing for, I don't know, eight years, it was about eight years ago, and that's where we're getting invited out there a lot by a lot of people.
[02:42:13.384 --> 02:42:15.146]  It was just a few folks that were willing to go on the show.
[02:42:16.735 --> 02:42:27.541]  And I'm telling you, across the board, but some of them, like Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie, that I know woke up and saw my films and Aaron Russo's, I'll leave it at that, and were awake.
[02:42:27.601 --> 02:42:29.362]  They got freaked out and went and joined the UN.
[02:42:29.903 --> 02:42:31.924]  See, some of them go, okay, it is all rigged.
[02:42:32.304 --> 02:42:34.145]  I will literally go sell out to it.
[02:42:34.845 --> 02:42:38.087]  Or they argue, well, I'll do more better, you know, inside the system.
[02:42:38.167 --> 02:42:44.711]  But what I'm saying is, the whole facade of Sumner Redstone and all these top lawyers and people that I've had meetings with,
[02:42:45.965 --> 02:42:54.894]  Literally is about keeping people on the plantation and mind control to keep Hollywood under the fake liberal progressive authoritarianism.
[02:42:55.434 --> 02:42:56.936]  The facade has already fallen.
[02:42:57.096 --> 02:42:57.236]  Yeah.
[02:42:57.536 --> 02:43:00.639]  And they're now figuring out they can go out and say and do what they want.
[02:43:01.591 --> 02:43:06.355]  And I'm telling you, House of Cards, I believe, is then going to be seen as the dam breaking.
[02:43:06.675 --> 02:43:08.437]  So I want to declare, they're dead.
[02:43:08.717 --> 02:43:10.178]  Hollywood, as the L.A.
[02:43:10.218 --> 02:43:15.162]  Mayor said a few months ago, is quote, in an emergency and is bankrupt and is in a crisis.
[02:43:15.262 --> 02:43:16.003]  You bet, it's over.
[02:43:16.463 --> 02:43:16.904]  It's over.
[02:43:17.344 --> 02:43:20.066]  It's over for them and mainstream media is over.
[02:43:20.326 --> 02:43:23.189]  The dinosaur media is over, but the next thing to fully implode
[02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:29.614]  I'm saying is Hollywood, and now they're finally desperate, where Man of Steel is decentralized anti-eugenics.
[02:43:30.214 --> 02:43:32.756]  And movies like Nut Job or Antigen to 21.
[02:43:33.296 --> 02:43:35.658]  Now suddenly, or the Lego movie is libertarian.
[02:43:37.259 --> 02:43:37.780]  Suddenly!
[02:43:38.826 --> 02:43:46.789]  Though, in their death throes, they're allowing the directors, I've talked to some of them, to actually go be pro-Liberty, and those are the only films that are making it now.
[02:43:47.129 --> 02:43:54.052]  So instead of Hollywood just collapsing, they can either collapse, or Hollywood can make the decision to survive and join with Liberty.
[02:43:54.392 --> 02:43:55.873]  But they've now reached that tipping point.
[02:43:55.913 --> 02:43:56.733]  What do you think's going to happen?
[02:43:57.469 --> 02:43:58.570]  Well, they'll follow the dollar.
[02:43:58.690 --> 02:44:01.991]  This is what you were saying when talking about the products that you sell.
[02:44:02.051 --> 02:44:06.573]  You know, everything you subsidize grows and everything you don't subsidize shrinks.
[02:44:06.633 --> 02:44:09.075]  So, I mean, in terms of giving money to people, right?
[02:44:09.115 --> 02:44:11.456]  So, whatever you subsidize is going to grow.
[02:44:11.536 --> 02:44:16.398]  So, yeah, if people want libertarian messages, then the people in Hollywood will change to reflect that.
[02:44:16.838 --> 02:44:20.560]  Don't go and spend your money on stuff that promotes an immoral agenda.
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:21.681]  It's very fundamental.
[02:44:21.741 --> 02:44:22.161]  You know, you've
[02:44:22.281 --> 02:44:23.822]  They've been wagging the dog here.
[02:44:23.882 --> 02:44:24.962]  It's time for us to wag them.
[02:44:25.062 --> 02:44:26.083]  You vote with the dollar.
[02:44:26.103 --> 02:44:30.145]  I mean, in House of Cards, I'm not going to give any spoilers, so don't panic about that.
[02:44:30.865 --> 02:44:37.008]  The rich guy says to the vice president, you are about to make an enemy of a man with $40 billion.
[02:44:37.328 --> 02:44:40.290]  And he says, what do I care about your money?
[02:44:40.310 --> 02:44:42.551]  I have the guys with all the guns.
[02:44:43.755 --> 02:44:48.916]  That is a very powerful statement to come out of mainstream media, or at least as mainstream as it's going to get.
[02:44:49.196 --> 02:44:51.296]  That is an incredibly powerful statement to come out.
[02:44:51.356 --> 02:44:53.357]  He's saying, I have all the guns.
[02:44:53.437 --> 02:44:54.417]  That's what government is.
[02:44:54.457 --> 02:44:55.337]  It's not your protector.
[02:44:55.377 --> 02:44:56.257]  It's not your savior.
[02:44:56.297 --> 02:44:57.778]  It's not the salvation of the poor.
[02:44:58.098 --> 02:44:59.158]  It's not the healer of the sick.
[02:44:59.198 --> 02:45:01.318]  It's not Jesus walking on water to bring you a donut.
[02:45:01.739 --> 02:45:03.759]  It is the guys with all the guns.
[02:45:04.119 --> 02:45:05.199]  And that's all it is.
[02:45:05.219 --> 02:45:06.379]  That's all it's ever been.
[02:45:06.619 --> 02:45:08.700]  And the fact that it actually has been said
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:16.049]  To the general public in one of the most popular shows to come out in the last year, I have all the guys with the guns.
[02:45:17.133 --> 02:45:17.453]  Shocking.
[02:45:17.673 --> 02:45:22.575]  I mean, it's something I've been saying for like 30 years, and now I can see it actually coming out.
[02:45:22.675 --> 02:45:25.116]  Government's a gang with a flag.
[02:45:25.156 --> 02:45:27.937]  They are the, you know, they're the disorganized crime.
[02:45:27.997 --> 02:45:29.718]  Organized crime is the mafia government.
[02:45:29.738 --> 02:45:31.079]  They're just the better criminals, right?
[02:45:31.099 --> 02:45:33.260]  Like the guys who own the banks are the better bank robbers.
[02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:36.721]  The guys who run the government are the better organized criminals.
[02:45:37.081 --> 02:45:39.682]  They just, they won, and they get to run the show.
[02:45:39.802 --> 02:45:44.704]  And the fact that it's actually being talked about, and there is this complete, it might as well be a mob movie.
[02:45:44.864 --> 02:45:46.225]  And it's incredibly popular.
[02:45:46.565 --> 02:45:47.986]  Yes, it is incredibly popular.
[02:45:48.266 --> 02:45:52.407]  And even the name of it, House of Cards, it's all about to come down.
[02:45:52.507 --> 02:45:58.449]  And what a wonderful thing it has been to be right for 30 years and have the credibility of accurately predicting catastrophe.
[02:45:58.810 --> 02:46:03.831]  Because it's really hard to argue with people who've been saying the non-obvious for 30 years who turn out to be completely right.
[02:46:03.871 --> 02:46:04.592]  And I think that this
[02:46:05.772 --> 02:46:09.416]  There's no future in the universe of House of Cards.
[02:46:09.596 --> 02:46:12.618]  It is all just circling the drain, grab as much as you can.
[02:46:12.638 --> 02:46:18.664]  It's like Indiana Jones, like when the door is coming down, you just grab whatever gold you can stuff in your pockets and try and get out.
[02:46:19.064 --> 02:46:22.187]  The days are numbered, and this is why the anti-gun stuff is so strong.
[02:46:22.247 --> 02:46:25.188]  Well, the elites are all running to armored redoubts in the middle of nowhere.
[02:46:25.488 --> 02:46:30.309]  They're already running down the temple hallway with the big rock rolling towards them.
[02:46:30.369 --> 02:46:31.109]  Right.
[02:46:31.189 --> 02:46:32.490]  And they're telling us to be calm, though.
[02:46:32.850 --> 02:46:33.150]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:33.170 --> 02:46:35.450]  Because they don't want us to run for the exits and block their exit.
[02:46:35.551 --> 02:46:36.551]  Buy some government bonds.
[02:46:36.611 --> 02:46:38.251]  It's a really great investment.
[02:46:38.511 --> 02:46:40.092]  They have bonds in Canada, the 75-year bonds.
[02:46:41.212 --> 02:46:46.174]  I mean, does anyone seriously think that this system is going to be around in 75 years to pay off that principle?
[02:46:46.234 --> 02:46:46.974]  It's mad!
[02:46:47.114 --> 02:46:53.256]  But what does it say that I could produce something like Loose Change seen over 150 million times downloaded?
[02:46:53.996 --> 02:46:55.397]  I mean, I helped produce those.
[02:46:56.397 --> 02:46:57.217]  What was the producer?
[02:46:57.837 --> 02:47:05.060]  That I can make films, I'm not bragging, but literally, I mean, I've made films that have been seen 50, 60 million times myself, a piece, just on YouTube and Google.
[02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:06.940]  And I'm nobody.
[02:47:07.361 --> 02:47:11.202]  Imagine when that paradigm finally shifts and people realize they don't have to run to L.A.
[02:47:11.222 --> 02:47:12.863]  to try to go make their movies.
[02:47:14.344 --> 02:47:20.106]  When everyone starts making them themselves and all that new talent gets turned loose, it's a new renaissance on every front.
[02:47:20.466 --> 02:47:29.090]  I don't think the globalists can stop human progress unless one of their little experiments or a war they start ends up, you know, killing everybody.
[02:47:29.470 --> 02:47:34.953]  I just hope that collectively, through individual action, we can block them from blowing the planet up.
[02:47:35.472 --> 02:47:36.432]  Well, that's what we have to do.
[02:47:36.472 --> 02:47:38.353]  I mean, people ask me, where does the future go?
[02:47:38.453 --> 02:47:41.494]  The future goes where the most passionate and virtuous people tell it to go.
[02:47:41.775 --> 02:47:42.355]  It's up to us.
[02:47:42.415 --> 02:47:43.075]  It's up to the people.
[02:47:43.155 --> 02:47:44.016]  I mean, where does the future go?
[02:47:44.036 --> 02:47:44.836]  It's where I want it to go.
[02:47:44.856 --> 02:47:45.656]  It's where you want it to go.
[02:47:45.676 --> 02:47:46.917]  It's where these listeners want it to go.
[02:47:46.977 --> 02:47:48.057]  That's where the future goes.
[02:47:48.597 --> 02:47:54.140]  And my experience was, you know, I struggled through graduate school in Canada, a heavily socialist country.
[02:47:54.180 --> 02:47:55.820]  It's not like I couldn't master the material.
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:48:01.963]  It was just really hard work trying to get free market voluntary principles to be accepted by academics up in Canada.
[02:48:02.623 --> 02:48:04.385]  And I tried to publish books.
[02:48:04.445 --> 02:48:05.005]  I wrote books.
[02:48:05.066 --> 02:48:06.427]  I got great reviews on the books.
[02:48:06.467 --> 02:48:07.368]  Nobody would publish them.
[02:48:08.188 --> 02:48:09.049]  Now I do.
[02:48:09.089 --> 02:48:09.850]  I don't have your reach.
[02:48:09.890 --> 02:48:12.693]  I got three to four million downloads a month of a philosophy show.
[02:48:12.773 --> 02:48:13.954]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[02:48:13.994 --> 02:48:18.018]  The fact that I can actually talk to people now... Yeah, top philosophers in the world can't get that.
[02:48:18.278 --> 02:48:20.240]  But you go out in the free market, boom, you win.
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:22.522]  It shows they can't pick the winners.
[02:48:23.002 --> 02:48:24.424]  Look at... More and more they can't.
[02:48:24.444 --> 02:48:25.024]  They're out of bullets.
[02:48:25.325 --> 02:48:27.447]  Look at how they try to make Hillary like a movie star.
[02:48:28.047 --> 02:48:30.428]  CNN, MSNBC, she's so beautiful, she's so glamorous.
[02:48:30.688 --> 02:48:32.789]  No wonder you're tanking like a lead balloon in the ratings.
[02:48:33.089 --> 02:48:37.150]  Trying to make Michelle Obama look like a reanimated snapping turtle.
[02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:39.011]  You know, how beautiful she is.
[02:48:39.491 --> 02:48:42.792]  I mean, it's literally a bunch of narcissistic criminals.
[02:48:43.252 --> 02:48:47.354]  At least the old-fashioned kleptocrats need to stay quiet and shut up and just look stately.
[02:48:47.654 --> 02:48:52.676]  They actually want to be on red carpets and parade around in front of us in some Edward Bernays type deal.
[02:48:52.716 --> 02:48:53.416]  It's not working!
[02:48:54.221 --> 02:48:56.403]  No, I think it's better if they don't talk so much.
[02:48:56.443 --> 02:49:00.165]  You know, it's like that really pretty but dumb girlfriend everyone has at one time in their life or another.
[02:49:00.185 --> 02:49:02.066]  It's like, I'll introduce you to my friends.
[02:49:02.206 --> 02:49:04.888]  If you could just smile and not talk too much, that would be excellent.
[02:49:04.928 --> 02:49:11.813]  Well, I mean, look, it's one thing if scumbag rock and roll people or whatever want to show off with a bunch of women in a jet and bling.
[02:49:11.833 --> 02:49:14.334]  People kind of go, oh, that's rock stars or that's hip hop people.
[02:49:14.395 --> 02:49:15.035]  It's still cheesy.
[02:49:15.495 --> 02:49:23.841]  But when the president and his whole camp followers are strutting around in red carpets and I'm good at killing people and look how sexy my wife is.
[02:49:24.662 --> 02:49:26.045]  I mean, it's delusion.
[02:49:27.388 --> 02:49:31.478]  Don't they know people don't want to look at you in a taxpayer-paid red carpet?
[02:49:32.336 --> 02:49:33.277]  We're sick of you!
[02:49:33.717 --> 02:49:35.818]  Well, but they live in the bubble of privilege, right?
[02:49:35.838 --> 02:49:36.759]  They live in the bubble.
[02:49:36.819 --> 02:49:39.380]  I can't picture what it's like to be on the other side of the gun.
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:45.864]  Because, you know, my whole life, when I was a kid, I mean, go to school, you pay your taxes, obey the law, you sit this side of the gun.
[02:49:45.924 --> 02:49:46.965]  Gun pointing straight at you, right?
[02:49:47.025 --> 02:49:47.685]  Barrel straight at you.
[02:49:48.145 --> 02:49:51.887]  I can't even imagine what it must be like, Alex, to be on the other side of that gun.
[02:49:52.108 --> 02:49:53.829]  In other words, people have to watch your show.
[02:49:54.069 --> 02:49:55.169]  People have to give you money.
[02:49:55.529 --> 02:49:56.710]  People have to do what you say.
[02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:58.211]  Like, I can't imagine, but it must be.
[02:49:58.231 --> 02:50:01.133]  That would be like a woman having sex with me who didn't want to.
[02:50:01.733 --> 02:50:02.314]  Yeah.
[02:50:02.334 --> 02:50:02.934]  That's horrible.
[02:50:05.016 --> 02:50:06.617]  We have some compassion, some empathy and all that.
[02:50:06.637 --> 02:50:09.480]  Well, no, I mean, the point is I want her to be passionate and like me.
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:12.162]  I want them out of free association.
[02:50:12.182 --> 02:50:13.683]  The government is raping us.
[02:50:13.723 --> 02:50:14.344]  They want to go.
[02:50:14.364 --> 02:50:15.324]  They want to rape us.
[02:50:15.485 --> 02:50:16.786]  They want to go back into power.
[02:50:16.806 --> 02:50:17.686]  This is what it like for me.
[02:50:17.766 --> 02:50:18.107]  No, I know.
[02:50:18.127 --> 02:50:19.748]  But I'm saying they want to make us.
[02:50:19.768 --> 02:50:20.208]  Oh, I know.
[02:50:20.228 --> 02:50:21.189]  It's rape.
[02:50:21.289 --> 02:50:21.630]  It's rape.
[02:50:22.190 --> 02:50:27.092]  That's because they know they have nothing of value to add, but their vanity can't accept that, so they have to force it on us.
[02:50:27.472 --> 02:50:32.834]  For me, being in power, be like, take a wild ferret and up into an aquarium and put it in that wild ferret.
[02:50:32.854 --> 02:50:35.015]  That ferret's gonna be like, ah, gotta get out.
[02:50:35.075 --> 02:50:37.917]  I mean, you put me in power for a day, I'm clawing to get out.
[02:50:37.977 --> 02:50:41.238]  These people work night and day for years to get back into power.
[02:50:41.258 --> 02:50:43.099]  I mean, it's like they're a completely different species.
[02:50:43.879 --> 02:50:45.840]  And then you study how they live, they're actually prisoners.
[02:50:46.815 --> 02:50:47.777]  In some ways, yeah.
[02:50:47.817 --> 02:50:49.980]  Yeah, because the bureaucracy is the real power.
[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:51.021]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:51.121 --> 02:50:53.445]  We're going to come in and jam in some phone calls, I promise.
[02:50:53.485 --> 02:50:55.087]  Todd, you're up next.
[02:50:55.207 --> 02:50:58.352]  And then, and then.
[02:50:58.372 --> 02:50:59.153]  There's two Todds.
[02:50:59.173 --> 02:51:01.336]  That's why I'm getting Todd in Texas and Todd in Canada.
[02:51:02.237 --> 02:51:04.258]  The two times, straight ahead and many others.
[02:51:04.278 --> 02:51:07.659]  A lot of people's lives and bodies are out of balance.
[02:51:08.219 --> 02:51:13.600]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops optimize pH level and get rid of harmful waste and acid.
[02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:18.041]  Just a few drops in water restores vibrance and energy and gets you back in balance.
[02:51:18.261 --> 02:51:20.662]  Now order two bottles and get $10 off your order.

[02:51:33.847 --> 02:51:34.947]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:35.027 --> 02:51:39.369]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:39.509 --> 02:51:45.171]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:45.251 --> 02:51:48.512]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:51:48.812 --> 02:51:51.375]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:51.475 --> 02:51:56.301]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:51:56.462 --> 02:51:56.682]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:56.702 --> 02:51:58.063]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:03.939 --> 02:52:04.319]  Hi there.
[02:52:04.940 --> 02:52:05.980]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:06.461 --> 02:52:09.663]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:52:10.263 --> 02:52:19.069]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:25.453]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:52:26.134 --> 02:52:27.715]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:52:28.315 --> 02:52:33.419]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:52:34.139 --> 02:52:41.223]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:52:42.063 --> 02:52:46.986]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:52:47.666 --> 02:52:53.549]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:59.492]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:52:59.873 --> 02:53:01.033]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:53:02.774 --> 02:53:06.096]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:53:06.196 --> 02:53:08.417]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:53:08.597 --> 02:53:16.822]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:53:17.122 --> 02:53:29.909]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula, sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:53:30.109 --> 02:53:40.918]  And then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:53:41.338 --> 02:53:47.384]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:53:47.604 --> 02:53:56.191]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[02:53:56.311 --> 02:54:00.254]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality.
[02:54:00.434 --> 02:54:01.275]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:09.101]  We're doing five minutes overdrive with Stefan Molyneux.
[02:54:09.121 --> 02:54:15.023]  We'll be on the nightly news tonight talking about the war on men, the subject of the new March issue of InfoWars magazine.
[02:54:15.443 --> 02:54:19.165]  Canadian Mounties override civilian rule to arbitrarily ban and confiscate firearms.
[02:54:19.205 --> 02:54:21.986]  That just broke minutes ago on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:22.346 --> 02:54:22.786]  Showdown.
[02:54:22.826 --> 02:54:26.888]  Maryland to target and confiscate 110,000 citizens' firearms.
[02:54:27.488 --> 02:54:27.929]  Video.
[02:54:27.949 --> 02:54:30.369]  Bloomberg wants to ban free speech on Facebook.
[02:54:30.510 --> 02:54:31.050]  Unbelievable.
[02:54:31.870 --> 02:54:34.631]  That is just some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[02:54:34.691 --> 02:54:39.252]  Government, police fund, radar, crowd scanner, detect 3D, printed weapons.
[02:54:39.312 --> 02:54:44.674]  And we have like a gun theme today that just, without me even telling my rider, just a theme appears of what's happening sometimes.
[02:54:45.174 --> 02:54:45.775]  Very serious.
[02:54:45.795 --> 02:54:48.055]  Let's jam in some calls for Stefan Molyneux.
[02:54:48.415 --> 02:54:50.176]  Todd in Texas, then Todd in Canada.
[02:54:50.476 --> 02:54:51.356]  You're on the air, Todd.
[02:54:52.057 --> 02:54:53.017]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[02:54:53.857 --> 02:54:56.198]  I'll talk a little bit about the IRS and
[02:54:57.319 --> 02:54:58.279]  The veil coming off.
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:01.580]  I think it came off with a loud thud on the floor.
[02:55:01.781 --> 02:55:04.822]  And I don't think anybody even looked to see what it was.
[02:55:07.402 --> 02:55:08.123]  No, I hear you.
[02:55:08.683 --> 02:55:13.124]  They declare the 5th when they're committing crimes, but then they don't let us declare the 5th in IRS forms.
[02:55:13.144 --> 02:55:13.985]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[02:55:14.745 --> 02:55:17.906]  And the next thing, everyone's saying they want to take your guns.
[02:55:18.226 --> 02:55:19.826]  I don't believe they want to take your guns at all.
[02:55:20.947 --> 02:55:21.667]  Not for one minute.
[02:55:21.927 --> 02:55:22.968]  Well, they're trying to confiscate them.
[02:55:23.008 --> 02:55:24.068]  Everywhere they get control, they do.
[02:55:25.327 --> 02:55:26.548]  No, I believe that's a ruse.
[02:55:26.648 --> 02:55:28.829]  I believe they don't want to take your guns.
[02:55:29.509 --> 02:55:30.970]  They want you to use your guns.
[02:55:31.310 --> 02:55:34.752]  And then they can blame the economic collapse on you.
[02:55:36.713 --> 02:55:41.195]  Well, when there is a large economic collapse, it'll be guns that maintain order, like in the L.A.
[02:55:41.235 --> 02:55:42.255]  riots when the cops left.
[02:55:42.275 --> 02:55:44.276]  So I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[02:55:44.296 --> 02:55:49.519]  Before we go to the other Todd, let's talk to Raymond, listening on 1530 AM in Chicago.
[02:55:49.619 --> 02:55:50.720]  Raymond, you're on the air.
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:51.040]  Go ahead.
[02:55:52.441 --> 02:55:52.922]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:53.422 --> 02:56:02.853]  I was calling in regards to the gun confiscation and them talking about, you know, even using the word gun for the younger people.
[02:56:02.873 --> 02:56:06.397]  Yeah, that's now a thought crime according to our dictator Bloomberg, yes.
[02:56:07.698 --> 02:56:13.505]  So, what are they gonna... I mean, then they should outlaw all these shoot-em-up games then.
[02:56:14.488 --> 02:56:14.868]  Oh, no, no.
[02:56:15.089 --> 02:56:21.594]  They're allowed to have shoot-em-up games violently on the Super Bowl, but a pro-gun thing about men protecting their household that doesn't even show a gun?
[02:56:21.914 --> 02:56:22.975]  That's banned on the Super Bowl.
[02:56:24.656 --> 02:56:25.437]  Well, exactly.
[02:56:25.977 --> 02:56:27.038]  I don't get their thinking.
[02:56:27.258 --> 02:56:28.619]  I really don't get their thinking.
[02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:29.760]  I hear you, brother.
[02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:35.225]  I'm talking about the young man that, you know, shoot his pop-tart in the shape of a gun.
[02:56:36.225 --> 02:56:37.587]  Well, that's in 1984.
[02:56:37.627 --> 02:56:39.048]  You can be disappeared for even less.
[02:56:40.199 --> 02:56:41.640]  I mean, so let him get suspended.
[02:56:42.001 --> 02:56:43.722]  The Pop-Tart looked like a gun to somebody else.
[02:56:44.203 --> 02:56:45.704]  If you see a cloud, looks like a gun.
[02:56:45.764 --> 02:56:47.265]  It's over your neighbor's house, arrest them.
[02:56:47.686 --> 02:56:48.607]  I think that's reasonable.
[02:56:48.867 --> 02:56:53.231]  If you are born with a mole in the shape of a submachine gun, you'll never see the light of day.
[02:56:53.251 --> 02:56:55.573]  Yeah, they just take a meat cleaver out, chop the baby up.
[02:56:55.873 --> 02:56:56.253]  Absolutely.
[02:56:56.353 --> 02:56:58.135]  Alright, appreciate your call, brother.
[02:56:58.155 --> 02:56:58.716]  Good to hear from you.
[02:56:58.736 --> 02:57:02.239]  Todd in Canada, here on the air with Stephan Molyneux, our guest.
[02:57:03.191 --> 02:57:04.231]  Gentlemen, how are you doing today?
[02:57:04.271 --> 02:57:05.272]  I just want to touch base.
[02:57:05.292 --> 02:57:08.213]  You started off this segment about the gun ban in Canada.
[02:57:08.553 --> 02:57:10.273]  It's the Swiss-style classic green.
[02:57:10.673 --> 02:57:15.275]  And what it is is the RCMP have just banned it without going through the proper channels and whatnot.
[02:57:15.595 --> 02:57:18.816]  Now what I've done is I've started a YouTube channel and I've started speaking out against it.
[02:57:19.196 --> 02:57:29.202]  This morning, I called the head office for the firearms registry here in Canada, and I videotaped the encounter, and I put it on YouTube.
[02:57:29.543 --> 02:57:33.805]  And I told them I was very nice to her, you know, I asked my questions, which she couldn't answer any of them.
[02:57:34.346 --> 02:57:37.047]  And I was just basically said, okay, thanks very much.
[02:57:37.108 --> 02:57:40.210]  Just so you know, I'm going to put this on YouTube and have a nice day.
[02:57:40.550 --> 02:57:42.371]  My phone rang 20 minutes later.
[02:57:42.791 --> 02:57:45.074]  She called and she said, have you put that on YouTube yet?
[02:57:45.455 --> 02:57:47.557]  And it was slow to load and it was in the process.
[02:57:47.677 --> 02:57:49.279]  And I just said, yeah, I put it on YouTube.
[02:57:49.580 --> 02:57:52.143]  And she said, well, you're gonna have to take that down because you didn't have my permission.
[02:57:52.817 --> 02:57:57.320]  At that point I informed her that she is a public servant and that I do not need her permission.
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:02.343]  So I encourage all Canadians to call the registry office and voice their concerns.
[02:58:02.423 --> 02:58:03.024]  Absolutely.
[02:58:03.064 --> 02:58:09.348]  Now I've been following this in Canada where they're lawlessly just reclassifying guns that they've registered and then confiscating them.
[02:58:09.708 --> 02:58:11.609]  And this is happening everywhere, Stefan.
[02:58:11.629 --> 02:58:12.610]  This is really getting serious.
[02:58:12.830 --> 02:58:17.034]  Well, you know, and this is the example of what we've been talking about, different rules for them than for you.
[02:58:17.575 --> 02:58:25.203]  You see, they can bypass legal procedures to take your guns, but if you take a call without their permission, that's wrong, because you don't have their permission.
[02:58:25.223 --> 02:58:28.827]  Even though if you announce it in their public servant, I know about Canadian law, same as ours, you can do it.
[02:58:29.708 --> 02:58:32.511]  Hey, I tell you what, caller, plug your YouTube channel.
[02:58:32.531 --> 02:58:34.293]  I want to look at that and add it to our article if it's good.
[02:58:35.074 --> 02:58:35.675]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:58:35.695 --> 02:58:36.916]  It's Awaken Canada.
[02:58:36.956 --> 02:58:37.697]  It's a new channel.
[02:58:37.757 --> 02:58:38.418]  It's not pretty.
[02:58:38.538 --> 02:58:39.018]  I've just started.
[02:58:39.058 --> 02:58:39.439]  It's okay.
[02:58:39.499 --> 02:58:40.920]  Awaken Canada on YouTube.
[02:58:41.261 --> 02:58:41.781]  We'll look it up.
[02:58:41.881 --> 02:58:42.662]  Overdrive coming up.
[02:58:42.682 --> 02:58:43.303]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:58:53.894 --> 02:59:02.900]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:11.086]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:11.386 --> 02:59:16.087]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:16.267 --> 02:59:22.969]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:23.049 --> 02:59:30.131]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:30.231 --> 02:59:37.093]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:37.253 --> 02:59:41.617]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:41.737 --> 02:59:45.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:45.120 --> 02:59:51.265]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:51.425 --> 02:59:53.127]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:54.948 --> 02:59:56.109]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:56.489 --> 02:59:57.891]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:58.531 --> 03:00:01.754]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:08.786 --> 03:00:12.970]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:13.631 --> 03:00:14.432]  You want answers?
[03:00:15.213 --> 03:00:16.094]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:16.754 --> 03:00:20.398]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:20.959 --> 03:00:25.003]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:42.483 --> 03:00:44.065]  Alright folks, final segment.
[03:00:44.706 --> 03:00:49.071]  Stefan Molyneux, our guest here, talking about the future of the world, our current state.
[03:00:49.131 --> 03:00:51.414]  We're done with calls now in the five minutes we've got here.
[03:00:51.434 --> 03:00:53.437]  I want to thank you for coming in and spending time with us.
[03:00:53.938 --> 03:00:58.804]  Stefan, getting into the war on mails briefly, but first you wanted to make a point.
[03:00:59.568 --> 03:01:08.979]  Yeah, I just really wanted to tell people that the government's escalation of its power is absolutely not going to stop until we stop it, right?
[03:01:09.660 --> 03:01:10.941]  It is going to continue to grow.
[03:01:10.961 --> 03:01:14.465]  It is like somebody wildly addicted to some substance, they need an intervention.
[03:01:14.986 --> 03:01:18.429]  In a weird kind of way, you can do it out of love for the people on the other side of the gun.
[03:01:18.729 --> 03:01:21.071]  You know, take the gun away from them gently, because it's not good for them.
[03:01:21.171 --> 03:01:28.697]  Like that great scene in the De Brando movie on the waterfront, where he takes that gun away from his brother gently and tenderly, who's there to kill him and all.
[03:01:29.398 --> 03:01:31.920]  And we just have to take this power away from people.
[03:01:31.980 --> 03:01:32.721]  It's bad for them.
[03:01:32.841 --> 03:01:34.462]  It's toxic for society as a whole.
[03:01:34.762 --> 03:01:35.323]  They're addicts.
[03:01:35.423 --> 03:01:36.944]  You know, what do you do with somebody who's addicted?
[03:01:36.964 --> 03:01:39.987]  You try and take that substance away from them so that they can get their heads clear.
[03:01:40.567 --> 03:01:41.507]  It's not going to stop.
[03:01:41.547 --> 03:01:45.349]  There's nothing... And I've noticed with narcissism, power addiction isn't just in government.
[03:01:45.769 --> 03:01:48.810]  Either people are getting more enlightened or they're going on weird power trips.
[03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:49.130]  Yeah.
[03:01:49.450 --> 03:01:51.611]  And like saying, I'm invincible, you're going to do what I say.
[03:01:51.671 --> 03:01:51.851]  Yeah.
[03:01:52.131 --> 03:01:53.231]  I'm right because I'm me.
[03:01:53.291 --> 03:01:59.893]  And, you know, we have to, you know, whether it's lovingly or assertively or even aggressively, we have to just take away this power from these people.
[03:01:59.973 --> 03:02:02.654]  It is so destructive to humanity as a whole.
[03:02:03.034 --> 03:02:04.575]  And they can't do it themselves.
[03:02:04.655 --> 03:02:08.756]  The only people who get that kind of power are people who are addicted and want more of it no matter what.
[03:02:10.170 --> 03:02:17.412]  I know some of your views on this, but our current issue of the magazine is all about the chemicals, the food, the water, the culture, every TV show, bad-mouthing fathers, men.
[03:02:18.253 --> 03:02:19.533]  What is the war on men about?
[03:02:20.493 --> 03:02:21.934]  I guess the state wants to be the daddy now?
[03:02:22.674 --> 03:02:29.936]  Yeah, I mean, the more that the government can break the bonds between men and women, the more that they can make women dependent on the state and guarantee future votes from them and their children.
[03:02:29.997 --> 03:02:31.857]  And Bernays wrote books on that, and it's public policy.
[03:02:31.897 --> 03:02:35.558]  And this has been a Marxist-leftist progressive policy for hundreds of years.
[03:02:35.618 --> 03:02:37.679]  They've done a great job with the family courts and everything.
[03:02:37.939 --> 03:02:41.321]  Oh yeah, I mean more money flows through the family courts and all the other courts put together.
[03:02:41.361 --> 03:02:42.342]  The average divorce costs $50,000.
[03:02:43.042 --> 03:02:50.546]  And in other areas of the world, like in some of the Scandinavian countries, you just write something in and send it off and you're divorced in six months.
[03:02:51.287 --> 03:02:52.407]  And the no-fault divorce.
[03:02:52.447 --> 03:02:53.748]  Divorce used to be a contract.
[03:02:54.108 --> 03:02:58.669]  The most serious contract in the world, much more important than your cell phone contract, which you can't break.
[03:02:59.829 --> 03:03:03.530]  And it was Reagan in the 60s in California brought in the no-fault divorce.
[03:03:03.550 --> 03:03:08.771]  You used to actually prove, you had to prove abuse or infidelity to get divorced before.
[03:03:09.111 --> 03:03:11.091]  And now you can just get divorced because you want to.
[03:03:11.111 --> 03:03:16.612]  The majority of divorce is 60-70% initiated by women for dissatisfaction, for reasons of dissatisfaction.
[03:03:16.632 --> 03:03:18.632]  And it's advertised as the really cool thing to do.
[03:03:18.892 --> 03:03:21.993]  The truth is, statistically, it's literally turning us into animals.
[03:03:22.433 --> 03:03:27.574]  It's destroying the human unit, and the children are now the wards of the state, and the women are the tarts of the state.
[03:03:28.075 --> 03:03:46.840]  Yeah, and so basically the government has now stepped into the provider role that used to be inhabited by the male, and therefore the women have now changed their allegiance towards statism, which is why more women vote Democrat, and why there's good statistical studies that show that the increase in state power accelerated significantly after giving women the vote.
[03:03:46.980 --> 03:03:51.161]  Again, not that giving the women the vote is bad or anything, but the inevitable result... It was Eva Bernays!
[03:03:51.761 --> 03:03:52.242]  We're good to go.
[03:04:10.721 --> 03:04:19.645]  It's worse than race, it's worse than gender, it's worse than demography, it's worse than socioeconomic status.
[03:04:20.145 --> 03:04:25.447]  But they advertise it in all the women's magazines and shows as like a new set of clothes.
[03:04:25.527 --> 03:04:27.848]  It is the sexy, cool thing to do.
[03:04:27.948 --> 03:04:30.189]  Yeah, and it is incredibly destructive for children.
[03:04:30.209 --> 03:04:31.110]  It's one thing to get divorced.
[03:04:31.170 --> 03:04:34.151]  And it is liberating to sit out and do whatever you want.
[03:04:34.651 --> 03:04:35.492]  Yeah.
[03:04:35.532 --> 03:04:38.934]  But you had kids, and now, statistically, it's going to wreck their life.
[03:04:38.994 --> 03:04:42.096]  And now we have to pay... But you don't care because you're a state-run Jezebel.
[03:04:42.136 --> 03:04:44.678]  Yeah, and we have to pay the price for them becoming criminals.
[03:04:44.778 --> 03:04:47.200]  It's everyone else who suffers when these kids get out into society.
[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:50.322]  Blacks had 10% in legitimacy before the Great Society.
[03:04:50.342 --> 03:04:50.562]  It's now 90%.
[03:04:50.742 --> 03:04:51.103]  Yeah.
[03:04:51.583 --> 03:04:53.124]  And whites are right on line with the same deal.
[03:04:53.384 --> 03:04:56.607]  Totally wrecked, just running around, completely collapsed.
[03:04:56.907 --> 03:04:57.767]  End of civilization.
[03:04:58.068 --> 03:04:58.228]  Yeah.
[03:04:58.728 --> 03:05:00.970]  Growth of the state is the end of the family, and vice versa.
[03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:01.810]  But it's trendy!
[03:05:01.890 --> 03:05:02.971]  But it's trendy!
[03:05:03.091 --> 03:05:04.012]  Oh, yeah!
[03:05:04.252 --> 03:05:13.298]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:05:13.359 --> 03:05:21.584]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:05:21.764 --> 03:05:30.030]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly custom... ...out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[03:05:30.250 --> 03:05:32.092]  I am extremely excited to announce
