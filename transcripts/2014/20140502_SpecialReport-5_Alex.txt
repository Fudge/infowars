[00:00:09.062 --> 00:00:18.710]  I'm Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs with InfoWars, and today we decided to come out to the University of Texas, Austin, and ask the people a few questions about our Constitution and whether or not it's outdated.
[00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.154]  I think the ideas behind it and what really was meant for it is not.
[00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:34.343]  I think that some of the vernacular and some of the hardcore ideas that some people think it represents, it is, but it was originally designed to be updated as the country grew.
[00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:37.325]  It follows the Magna Carta, you know?
[00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:37.986]  Come on, man!
[00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.689]  Outdated piece of paper.
[00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.754]  No, you liberal college professors, no!
[00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:46.277]  It is not an outdated piece of document.
[00:00:46.678 --> 00:00:51.626]  According to a recent poll, 59% of Americans agree that the Constitution is outdated.
[00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:53.108]  Do you believe it's an outdated document?
[00:00:54.205 --> 00:01:00.089]  Yes, I believe it's outdated and kind of misinterpreted it based on lobbyists and how they want to interpret it.
[00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.490]  I haven't really thought about it.
[00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.091]  I think it should be modernized.
[00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:09.195]  I think we shouldn't follow a book that was written in the 19th century, like, or 7th, 18th century, so.
[00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:12.998]  Okay, so if you could make any kind of changes to it, what would they be?
[00:01:13.998 --> 00:01:15.760]  Um, specifically gun laws.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.441]  How so?
[00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.221]  I think our gun laws should be more tightened and controlled.
[00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:25.444]  I think it was written for a time that everyone walked around with guns and stuff.
[00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:30.588]  And right now we have police patrolling and government here to protect us.
[00:01:30.788 --> 00:01:31.909]  I'd say that's probably true.
[00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.452]  I mean, especially for those that read it.
[00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:43.369]  You know, as for what it is, what's written on the paper, you know, it allows for very little flexibility, and, I mean, to a degree, but, yes, I would say yes.
[00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:51.071]  I'm not so sure, but I would say, yeah, it's outdated, at least looking at the views on news and everything, so.
[00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:56.832]  Recently retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said that we should change the Constitution.
[00:01:57.252 --> 00:02:02.534]  We should take a lot of the amendments away, get it down to about seven, and then also remove the right to bear arms.
[00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:03.514]  Do you think that's a good idea?
[00:02:04.494 --> 00:02:06.074]  I do not think that's a good idea.
[00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:06.654]  I don't know.
[00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:09.015]  We've got... to seven rights?
[00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:10.195]  Like, in the Bill of Rights?
[00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:11.095]  Is that what you were saying?
[00:02:11.716 --> 00:02:12.956]  I mean, we've got a Bill of Rights.
[00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:16.777]  That's like our ten, you know, most important, like, fundamental rights.
[00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:18.357]  It's not okay to take that away.
[00:02:19.717 --> 00:02:23.958]  I think the citizens should always be able to protect themselves from the government in some sort of way.
[00:02:24.518 --> 00:02:29.119]  Maybe not guns, but maybe the right to bear arms in a political sense?
[00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:29.739]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.220]  Do you think we should just get rid of the Second Amendment altogether or keep it?
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.780]  Is that a good idea?
[00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:34.808]  What's the Second Amendment again?
[00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:35.912]  The right to bear arms?
[00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:36.715]  Okay, yeah.
[00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:37.758]  Is that the gun control one?
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.143]  Yeah, that's the gun control one.
[00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:48.528]  I think that's a personal choice because it is necessary sometimes to have weapons.
[00:02:50.728 --> 00:02:54.609]  I would say that people should be allowed to bear arms.
[00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:55.549]  Should or shouldn't?
[00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.890]  Shouldn't.
[00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.830]  So you don't think it's good for us to be able to protect ourselves?
[00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.171]  I mean, it's good, but if the other person doesn't have the weapon, he can...
[00:03:05.572 --> 00:03:06.793]  Shoot you or anything, right?
[00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:08.754]  I mean, you wouldn't know if he's a criminal, right?
[00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:29.729]  Has a gun, but then you won't have one, so now you're without one and you're dead.
[00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:35.317]  I think that the principles laid down in the Constitution are relevant today.
[00:03:35.437 --> 00:03:38.622]  They are... You know, I really don't know the Constitution that well.
[00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:57.529]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.832]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:02.594]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[00:04:02.634 --> 00:04:08.880]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.866]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:18.768]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:21.849]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:30.032]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:32.373]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:33.513]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:42.557]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
