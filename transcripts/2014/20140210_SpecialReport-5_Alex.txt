[00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:20.958]  The tragic overdose death of Philip Seymour Hoffman, the Academy Award winning actor, is an illustration of what a fraud the war on drugs is.
[00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:29.883]  He died reportedly of a heroin overdose of a particularly strong type, of course out of Afghanistan, known as the Ace of Spades.
[00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:36.287]  And soon after, they raided and arrested four people in connection to selling him the heroin.
[00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:41.457]  Well, the heroin is processed out of opium that comes from Afghanistan.
[00:00:41.977 --> 00:00:50.640]  Before the liberation of Afghanistan in 2001, less than 7% of world opium production came out of Afghanistan.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.060]  Today, it's over 93%, approaching 97%.
[00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:16.147]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is simply incredible because you have the war on drugs making the opium illegal so that the black market can be controlled by big banks and the government and so they can shut down their competition while filling the prisons with the low-level dealers who are compartmentalized.
[00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:23.456]  Our troops, on record, grow the opium and protect it, and it's then shipped out of the country.
[00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:25.618]  The Russians have complained about this.
[00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:27.941]  The Europeans have complained about this.
[00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:32.787]  NATO is heavily involved in trafficking the narcotics out with the Pentagon.
[00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:39.971]  The Taliban finances much of its operations by selling opium, which is grown from poppies, which are right now being harvested.
[00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:41.391]  So, here's the question.
[00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:45.893]  Why are American troops now helping Afghan farmers grow that opium?
[00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:53.016]  In western Kandahar, poppy farmers score, kill, harvest their crop, and the Americans do nothing to stop them.
[00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:59.217]  And now because the public's begun to wake up to this, they've hidden it in plain view.
[00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:22.191]  With Fox News, ABC News, you name it, BBC, the list goes on and on.
[00:02:22.552 --> 00:02:24.856]  Coming out and going, yeah, the troops kind of guard it.
[00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.080]  They don't like it, but that's their culture.
[00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.254]  We provide them security, we're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.
[00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:33.876]  And the Marines are doing the good thing.
[00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:37.259]  Dave, Layton, and Allison, back to you guys in New York.
[00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.582]  He just explains it better than we can ever read in any paper.
[00:02:40.622 --> 00:02:42.885]  What a dilemma it is with the opium trade.
[00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.707]  Yeah, they make so much money off the opium per yard there.
[00:02:45.727 --> 00:02:47.870]  They make so much money compared to those other crops.
[00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.352]  They're not guarding it because it's the Afghan culture.
[00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:58.118]  They're guarding it because they're ramping up production, giving them the fertilizer to ship it in worldwide.
[00:02:58.138 --> 00:03:02.262]  $500 billion a year in opium profits alone.
[00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:10.730]  The British were able to bring down the Chinese government over a 50-year period because the Chinese made opium illegal.
[00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:16.631]  And so the British could infiltrate with it and make huge profits and buy off the local governments.
[00:03:17.592 --> 00:03:23.617]  That same system has been done by these offshore megabanks that are laundering hundreds of billions of dollars of money each year.
[00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:26.960]  The police have been corrupted with asset forfeiture seizure.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.621]  The list goes on and on.
[00:03:29.181 --> 00:03:29.722]  Think about it.
[00:03:30.062 --> 00:03:33.505]  Our government helps grow and ship the opium out of Afghanistan.
[00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:36.007]  And then at the same time,
[00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:43.383]  has the nerve to arrest low-level dealers that sell it to people like Hoffman who tragically die.
[00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:56.134]  There is a scourge of heroin in the last 12 years flooding the world out of Afghanistan and our criminal government run by offshore mega banks is at the wheel driving the entire thing.

[00:04:08.906 --> 00:04:13.751]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:04:13.932 --> 00:04:21.140]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
