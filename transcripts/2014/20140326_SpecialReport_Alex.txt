[00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:26.293]  Looks pretty cool, doesn't it?
[00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:31.856]  The things we can do with modern technology such as the drone that made that viral YouTube video.
[00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:36.938]  But just like much of our modern technologies, drones are ripe for abuse.
[00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:40.860]  When is a drone picture
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.021]  A benefit to society.
[00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:45.203]  When does it become stalking?
[00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:47.185]  When does it invade privacy?
[00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:49.406]  How close to a home can a drone go?
[00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:55.771]  I'm in my home and there's a demonstration out front and I go to peek out the window and there's a drone facing me.
[00:00:56.552 --> 00:01:01.396]  Well, whoever was running it turned it around quickly and it crashed.
[00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:10.440]  I'm not sure why anyone would want to peek in the window of Senator Feinstein, but regardless, I'm glad the Senator is at least speaking out about the issue of privacy.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.301]  She had previously said that it's okay to spy on U.S.
[00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:16.963]  citizens and may now be rethinking her choice of words.
[00:01:17.623 --> 00:01:24.448]  Don't get me wrong though, there are plenty of harmless uses for a drone, such as land surveying or making YouTube videos.
[00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:28.470]  But when does that become a violation of someone's privacy?
[00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:34.354]  For example, is it an illegal search and seizure if police fly a drone over someone's property?
[00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:39.558]  The mayor of Seattle seems to think so, but there are plenty of other cities that would disagree.
[00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:44.142]  Deputies can fly this 50-pound Shadowhawk unmanned helicopter.
[00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:52.569]  A powerful camera on the front is controlled with this game-like console and the manufacturer says this one's even designed to carry weapons.
[00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:59.775]  You have a stun baton where you can actually engage somebody at altitude with the aircraft and a stun baton would essentially disable a suspect.
[00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:06.461]  If one of these things, quote, malfunctions and hits an unintended target, who, if anyone, will be held accountable?
[00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:10.645]  Not to mention the weirdos who use drones as high-tech peeping toms.
[00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:13.567]  And now for the two big words.
[00:02:14.148 --> 00:02:15.029]  Predator drones.
[00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:18.452]  You will never see it coming.
[00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:23.797]  We've seen how inaccurate lethal drones have been overseas.
[00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:25.237]  They've even killed U.S.
[00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:25.838]  citizens.
[00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:30.360]  So why on earth would anyone want to bring these things to the states?
[00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:35.823]  It is great to see American machines helping to promote peace abroad.
[00:02:36.163 --> 00:02:42.987]  So then tell me, why can't we use these machines here at home?
[00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:46.729]  Why is America so robo-phobic?
[00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:55.543]  So in closing, if you're innocently filming a class project or trying to find the best place to install a pool on your land, then go ahead.
[00:02:56.063 --> 00:03:00.586]  But remember, while we're busy watching YouTube videos, they're busy watching us.
