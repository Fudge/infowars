[00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:04.383]  No.
[00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.235]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:27.844]  Now today, the ISIS group, IS, Islamic State, Al-Syaida, whatever you want to call these guys, government, fund, terrorists, whatever, have come out with a full-length version of the Flames of War.
[00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:31.686]  Now just the other day we gave you a small preview of the trailer that was released.
[00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:34.408]  Well today they released a 55-minute version
[00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:36.009]  We're good.
[00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:54.802]  And
[00:01:12.068 --> 00:01:12.529]  Very good.
[00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:32.527]  We're good to go.
[00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.187]  We're good to go.
[00:02:28.522 --> 00:02:40.485]  In the face of the dark wave of the Crusader force, the historical land of two rivers bore life to a mission that would transform the political landscape of the world.
[00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:48.087]  A mission that would herald a return to the Khilafah and revive the creed of Tawheed.
[00:02:48.787 --> 00:03:01.582]  It was the establishment of the Islamic State, nourished by the blood of the truthful Mujahideen, to unite the Ummah on one call, one banner, one leader.
[00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:08.610]  Thus, the war between Iman and Kufr was ignited.
[00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:18.255]  You are with us or against us.
[00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:24.618]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:03:24.678 --> 00:03:28.921]  They thought they had won.
[00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.562]  Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.
[00:03:31.582 --> 00:03:37.966]  In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.
[00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:43.994]  They lied.
[00:03:44.955 --> 00:03:50.517]  The flames were only beginning to intensify.
[00:03:53.038 --> 00:03:55.659]  Obama then claimed it was over.
[00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.580]  Iraq's future will be in the hands of its people.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.802]  America's war in Iraq will be over.
[00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:06.639]  They lied!
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.063]  By the grace of Allah, the Islamic State expanded into the land of Sham.
[00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:51.674]  As the ravenous flame continued spreading, roaring in hunger for the fuel of Nusayri blood, the flames in Iraq meanwhile continued their crawl, growing stronger, leaving the Americans in bewilderment, pondering what strategy to adopt in fighting the Islamic State.
[00:04:53.394 --> 00:05:01.177]  The reply from the White House was deceitful, as Obama was forced to respond to the rapid rise of the Islamic State.
[00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:10.260]  To stop the advance on our bill, I've directed our military to take targeted strikes against ISIL terrorist convoys should they move toward the city.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.922]  And so even as we support Iraqis as they take the fight to these terrorists, American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq.
[00:05:21.015 --> 00:05:23.136]  For in reality, the fighting had just begun.
[00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:47.806]  Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now,
[00:05:55.506 --> 00:05:56.587]  We're good to go.
[00:06:13.254 --> 00:06:16.996]  Alert the public to Obama's blatant abuse of power.
[00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:20.918]  Defend the Second Amendment with our top-seller Come and Take It t-shirts.
[00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:21.639]  And look at that!
[00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:25.161]  Women's cut tank tops and t-shirts now available.
[00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:25.821]  Nice hat.
