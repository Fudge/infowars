[00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.591]  Another round of celebrities have been hacked.
[00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:20.699]  Reportedly, Hollywood stars like Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence have had their photos stolen, their intimate moments taken, by a hacker known as the Original Guy, who claims to be working with others.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.705]  One of the actresses affected commented that she had previously deleted the photos and was shocked when they appeared on the internet.
[00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:34.289]  At this point, we don't know who all the players are, but we do know about the weaknesses of cloud storage systems.
[00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:41.973]  Years back, even the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak warned of such vulnerabilities, saying, With the cloud, you don't own anything.
[00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:48.057]  The more we transfer everything onto the web, onto the cloud, the less we're going to have control over it.
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.203]  These things are all too common, but they only make the news when they happen to big Hollywood stars.
[00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:19.648]  We here at InfoWars have been warning about these vulnerabilities for years and even filed a report earlier this summer.
[00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:22.650]  NSA snoops shared intercepted sextants.
[00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:34.091]  So, you know, Snowden's saying that his colleagues back at the NSA, they got your sex messages, they got your naked selfies, and they're out there laughing and sharing them back and forth, trading them around like playing cards.
[00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:39.693]  But Leanne, we live in a world where something as simple as taking a picture of your feet could go viral on the Internet.
[00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:41.634]  And you don't want to live in that kind of environment.
[00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:47.416]  Be careful what information you put on your phone, on your computer, anything with online capability.
[00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:49.377]  Because whether it's a pack of hackers,
[00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.954]  According to DARPA, who invented the internet and set up the modern infrastructure we live under, within just a few years, devices are coming out where they won't store data natively, or very little, you'll be forced onto a cloud-like system.
[00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:48.432]  Cloud computing, headed up by Amazon, Google, and Apple, Oracle, Cisco, and others, openly admits that they're co-housing their servers with the NSA and the CIA, and that Microsoft has basically been part of the intelligence combine since its founding, along with IBM.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:06.788]  So when I talk about hundreds of stars having their photos grabbed by a hacker who was able to break into the Apple Cloud, it's a fact that these systems make us insecure, not secure.
[00:03:07.748 --> 00:03:16.572]  All you had to do was get into the cloud, search by their names, find their accounts, and download it.
