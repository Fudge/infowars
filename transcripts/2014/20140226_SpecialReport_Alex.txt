[00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.994]  Remember when James Clapper was pointedly asked?
[00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:11.327]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:13.049]  No, sir.
[00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:16.760]  He can't even look Senator Wyden in the eye.
[00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:21.105]  And soon after, the Snowden documents proved that it was a blatant lie.
[00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:25.130]  But Clapper isn't the only bureaucrat to lie under oath in congressional testimony.
[00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:29.014]  Back in November 2012, the CDC said this.
[00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:33.560]  Vaccines and their components did not increase the risk for autism.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:50.880]  But after 10 years and 100 FOIA requests, Dr. Brian Hooker has uncovered documentary evidence that the Center for Disease Control, the CDC, did in fact conduct studies on the link between autism and thimerosal, the preservative in vaccines that is 50% mercury by weight.
[00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:52.762]  I think?
[00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:12.555]  I think?
[00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:35.710]  And therefore required the approval of top CDC officials prior to the presentation.
[00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:46.237]  The 1999 study was entitled, Increased Risk of Developmental Neurologic Impairment After High Exposure to Thimerosal Containing Vaccines in the First Month of Life.
[00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:54.284]  Did the CDC cover up studies and data that linked thimerosal to autism in order to help big pharmaceutical companies?
[00:01:54.624 --> 00:02:05.533]  Dr. Hooker points out that the former director of the CDC, which purchases $4 billion worth of vaccines annually, is now the president of Merck's vaccine division.
[00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:15.100]  Until the wonderful people like us introduced vaccinations to Africa, the African children basically were autism-free.
[00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:18.387]  They never heard of autism, never had a case of it.
[00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:19.149]  Are you familiar with that?
[00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.051]  Have you ever heard that before?
