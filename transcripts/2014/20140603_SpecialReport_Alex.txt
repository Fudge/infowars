[00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:08.660]  Planned Parenthood has reached a new low.
[00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:14.527]  A report has surfaced pointing out that Planned Parenthood says that the Bible actually supports abortion.
[00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:16.610]  A letter addressed to clergy reads,
[00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:35.009]  Well, on the flip side of that same coin, the Bible doesn't specifically mention using an automobile to mow down innocent pedestrians because you're a sex-deprived sociopath.
[00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.673]  But even the most devout atheists can see that such an action is not justifiable.
[00:00:40.153 --> 00:00:43.776]  More to the point, the Bible includes a section called the Ten Commandments.
[00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:44.977]  Maybe you've heard of this.
[00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:47.379]  One which reads, Thou shalt not kill.
[00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:50.061]  Some translations say, Thou shalt not murder.
[00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:52.123]  Either or would apply to abortion.
[00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:57.684]  People skeptical of the Bible will point out that there is plenty of violence in its pages, which is true.
[00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:03.965]  King David, who probably single-handedly killed the most people in the Bible, lived a life of constant warfare.
[00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:08.966]  But if you recall, David's campaign started when Goliath came to kill his people.
[00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:16.108]  So in self-defense, not murder of convenience, David slew Goliath and waged war against the Philistines.
[00:01:16.448 --> 00:01:17.368]  With that said,
[00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:22.530]  Planned Parenthood, whose current president says her children's lives began when she gave birth.
[00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.210]  When do you think life starts?
[00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.950]  Yeah.
[00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:26.951]  Well, I don't know if it's controversial.
[00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:30.252]  I don't know that it's really relevant to the conversation.
[00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:32.833]  But for me, I'm a mother of three children.
[00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.534]  For me, life began when I delivered them.
[00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:41.176]  They've been probably the most important thing in my life ever since.
[00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:43.757]  But that's my own personal decision.
[00:01:45.097 --> 00:01:45.517]  We're good to go.
[00:02:01.124 --> 00:02:08.067]  Even though the scriptures clearly read, Keep thee far from a false matter, and the innocent and righteous slay thou not.
[00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:10.609]  For I will not justify the wicked.
[00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:15.531]  But Jesus said, Suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me.
[00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:17.692]  For such is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:21.694]  Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person.
[00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:23.955]  And all the people shall say, Amen.
[00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:30.940]  This is clearly another attack on the Word of God, providing itching ears with the doctrine they so desperately want to hear.
