[00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:13.559]  Last week, a man came to this Austin gun store seeking to purchase a firearm and a large amount of ammunition.
[00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.000]  What makes the store unique?
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.903]  That the man had plans to go to a nearby hospital and commit mass murder.
[00:00:31.926 --> 00:00:35.107]  Alright, so we're here with Michael Cargill, the owner of Central Texas Gun Works.
[00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:35.807]  Good to see you, Mike.
[00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:37.648]  So tell us exactly what happened.
[00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:40.289]  Well, we had a guy come in on Thursday.
[00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:47.111]  He walked into the shop and talked to my clerk and he was saying he had a really bad day and he needed to buy a gun, which was no big deal.
[00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:51.452]  A person's had a bad day, something happened in their life, and they want to get a gun to protect themselves.
[00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:54.293]  We're kind of used to that, just like any other customer.
[00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:57.515]  So then she started, you know, showing him different types of guns.
[00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:00.237]  He wanted to, you know, look at a particular one, a Sig.
[00:01:00.517 --> 00:01:03.079]  Said a couple other things that kind of set her off a little bit.
[00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.521]  She was just not sure, you know, about what was going on.
[00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.303]  I come out to meet the guy and shake his hands and everything.
[00:01:08.323 --> 00:01:08.943]  I said, hey, how you doing?
[00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:09.484]  My name is Mike.
[00:01:09.564 --> 00:01:19.291]  He got into, well, he got out of the hospital and he was really upset about the people at the hospital and he wanted to get a gun and buy some ammunition and go over there and shoot everyone at the hospital.
[00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:47.325]  So that's when I hit the sound alarm and then continued talking with the guy let him fill out the paperwork the 4473 and then the police got here I pointed him out you know say hey this is guy right here and they kind of grabbed him as the police came in he actually said you know said it again you know he said he was an FBI agent
[00:01:52.456 --> 00:01:54.799]  So you're telling me that the ATF confiscated the weapon?
[00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.379]  Yes.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.744]  So not only did they confiscate the gun, they also took the 4473 as well.
[00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:06.990]  Because the way I understand it, the guy was in the hospital before coming here to us the first time.
[00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.913]  When they arrested him, they were going to take him back to the hospital.
[00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:12.635]  And the hospital can only hold him for 48 hours.
[00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.824]  So in order to hold him past that point, they had to get the evidence.
[00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:20.845]  So as far as you know, is he facing any type of charges?
[00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:22.005]  That I'm not sure.
[00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:23.686]  Not sure what's going on with that.
[00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:25.226]  I know I'm out of a gun.
[00:02:25.246 --> 00:02:27.727]  Do you plan to get the gun back?
[00:02:28.288 --> 00:02:32.889]  They told me that I would probably get the gun back, you know, I'm thinking maybe a year or so.
[00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:33.410]  Really?
[00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.070]  That long?
[00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.391]  Does this happen very frequently?
[00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:38.191]  No, it's a very rare situation.
[00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:41.373]  I mean, we have great customers and that's just one of those things that's happened.
[00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:41.893]  It's just like, whoa.
[00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.892]  You know, something's just not right.
[00:02:44.093 --> 00:02:47.756]  You know, so it's best that we, you know, take the steps that we did.
[00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:53.923]  If we didn't sell him a gun that day, gone somewhere else, got something else other than a firearm, and, you know, acted on it.
[00:02:54.183 --> 00:03:00.730]  I know he filled out the ATF form and police were called, but you guys used your better judgment to stop this guy from purchasing a firearm.
[00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.351]  Is that correct?
[00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:01.591]  Correct.
[00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:03.633]  That's when the gun story is going to come into play.
[00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:05.355]  Everyone has a step in that process.
[00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:07.046]  You know, he comes in here to us.
[00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.468]  You know, we have a conversation.
[00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:09.569]  We look and listen.
[00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.055]  If something does not feel right, then that is up to us to take those extra steps and say, hey, something's not right.
[00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:16.958]  We need to turn this over to the authorities.
