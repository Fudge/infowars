[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.691]  Special assignment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:02.351 --> 00:00:03.532]  Looking for the true patriots.
[00:00:03.793 --> 00:00:05.394]  Is the knowledge still alive and well?
[00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:08.857]  In the party scene on 6th Street in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.021]  Can you name all seven continents of the Earth?
[00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:15.063]  Of the Earth?
[00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:24.993]  So there's Asia, Africa, South America, North America, Europe, Antarctica,
[00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:29.598]  South... no, wait.
[00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.239]  Oh yeah, Australia's my continent, is it?
[00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.259]  Asia?
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.400]  America?
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.460]  South America?
[00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:43.021]  Japan?
[00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:44.021]  Hong Kong?
[00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:45.361]  You know, Canada?
[00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:47.002]  You know, Africa?
[00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:48.242]  Three of the Bill of Rights?
[00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.443]  That would be... Man, you are picking a hard night for me.
[00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:57.280]  Can you name the Vice President?
[00:00:58.501 --> 00:00:58.942]  Dick Cheney?
[00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:00.103]  John Boehner.
[00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:06.168]  Was John Adams allergic to the peanuts on Air Force One?
[00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:07.749]  Yes.
[00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.870]  Yes.
[00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:10.292]  He was.
[00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:11.453]  I think that's how he died.
[00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:12.013]  Really?
[00:01:12.293 --> 00:01:13.094]  Yeah, the peanuts.
[00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:13.875]  That's tragic.
[00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:16.077]  It is.
[00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:20.280]  Somebody should have been on board making sure, you know, eating the peanuts before he did.
[00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:21.802]  Liam McAdoo?
[00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:23.174]  Hot.
[00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:25.977]  Everybody knows that.
[00:01:27.778 --> 00:01:29.680]  You remember when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.680]  1941?
[00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.565]  The journey to find some red-blooded Americans continues.
[00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:38.547]  When we fought Hitler, what war was that?
[00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:39.628]  World War II.
[00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.630]  Thank you very much.
[00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.551]  You're a true patriot.
[00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:43.892]  Of course I am.
[00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:44.612]  I'm an American.
[00:01:44.673 --> 00:01:44.873]  Are you?
[00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.182]  John Adams, was he allergic to the peanuts on Air Force One?
[00:01:53.722 --> 00:01:53.943]  No.
[00:01:54.803 --> 00:01:55.023]  No?
[00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:55.543]  No.
[00:01:57.865 --> 00:02:00.926]  You finished, but no, that's not my understanding of how he died.
[00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:03.888]  Who is the greatest president of the United States?
[00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:04.908]  Mandela!
[00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:17.059]  Well, we've had some very interesting responses out here mingling with the drunk and brainless, but the jury is still out on whether or not there is any hope for humanity.
[00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:25.621]  Now, if you've got some questions that you'd like us to ask these fine folks the next time we're out here, leave your suggestions in the comments below.
