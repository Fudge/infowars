[00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:14.686]  A new vaccine meant to counter HIV may actually increase the chances of contracting the disease.
[00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:26.590]  A new study shows that recipients of an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck using a genetically modified adenovirus actually increased their risk of contracting HIV infection.
[00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.732]  Researchers randomly assigned 800 uninfected, sexually active adults around South Africa
[00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:33.632]  We're good to go.
[00:00:56.624 --> 00:00:59.026]  And this is also the case for the Gardasil vaccine.
[00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:05.691]  It's been shown that vaccinating young girls with Gardasil may actually increase their risk of contracting cervical cancer.
[00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:16.781]  With the recent resurgence of measles, whooping cough, and varicella in highly immunized populations, research like this speaks to fundamental flaws in vaccine-centric health care.
[00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:21.924]  Children receive nearly 50 vaccines by the time they are 6 years old.
[00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:30.690]  26 of those are administered by their first birthday, potentially compromising the brain and immune system at a critical developmental stage.
[00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:38.156]  Instead of epidemics of measles and polio, now we have epidemics of chronic autoimmune and neurological disease.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:48.667]  Co-founder and President of the National Vaccine Information Center, Barbara Lowe Fisher, says that in the last 20 years, rates of asthma and attention deficit disorder have doubled.
[00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.409]  Diabetes and learning disabilities have tripled.
[00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.976]  Chronic arthritis now affects nearly 1 in 5 Americans, and in many states, autism has increased by 300% or more.
[00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:07.782]  And the assumption that these mass vaccination policies are playing no role is not only unscientific, it's dangerous.
[00:02:08.382 --> 00:02:20.685]  With so many unanswered questions about the safety and necessity of giving so many vaccines to children, the right to informed consent to vaccination takes on even greater legal and ethical significance.
[00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:24.605]  The issue of informed consent transcends medicine.
[00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:28.246]  What about the constitutional concept of individual freedom?
[00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:36.508]  If they can now tag, track you down, and force you to be injected with a biological agent of unknown toxicity today,
[00:02:37.088 --> 00:02:42.643]  What sort of other individual freedoms can they take away from you, in the name of the greater good, tomorrow?
