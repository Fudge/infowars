[00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:05.556]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:12.759]  We're in Clayton, Missouri where we're expecting to hear the verdict on whether Officer Darren Wilson will be indicted for the situation with Mike Brown.
[00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.040]  If you'll walk with me for a moment.
[00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:20.003]  This area is pretty dead right now except for a few media trucks you can see over here on the sides.
[00:00:20.483 --> 00:00:25.065]  You can see CBS, you can see Frontlines out here, multiple other organizations as well.
[00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.126]  But something that caught my attention when I walked up to
[00:00:28.803 --> 00:00:32.085]  There's a sign on here besides the leave your guns outside sign.
[00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:33.406]  This one says cancel.
[00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:35.768]  They're canceling classes here in this building.
[00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:43.052]  Now I would suspect it has something to do directly with the violence that they expect to happen should Officer Darren Wilson get off.
[00:00:43.473 --> 00:00:48.216]  Now we've already been talking about there's a lot of people on social media saying they're gonna riot regardless.
[00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:55.921]  You know just like you know during after a football game or a hockey championship people go out and flip over cars they tear down the street signs and all that wild stuff.
[00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:57.442]  Hopefully none of that stuff will happen.
[00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:59.144]  Well, there's been a lot of talk about it.
[00:00:59.564 --> 00:01:01.226]  The business owners are taking this seriously.
[00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:05.410]  We see in Ferguson, Missouri, they're boarding up the windows, taking all the necessary precautions.
[00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.756]  We see that DHS is in town, the police officers are ready to go should something happen.
[00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:14.840]  So stay tuned to InfoWars.com as we bring you the most up-to-date information.
