[00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:05.848]  Yeah.
[00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:13.358]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:20.923]  Now here at InfoWars, we try to keep you the viewer and the people all around the world awake to the information going on.
[00:00:21.303 --> 00:00:28.468]  You know, over the past few years, Alex Jones has repeatedly told you and others here at InfoWars that the NSA is collecting your data.
[00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:40.096]  We have actual proof via my phone, my user agreement, where it says the NSA is taking my data and they're not responsible for any loss of data from my phone.
[00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.251]  This is mind blowing.
[00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:58.397]  I mean, like I said, we've known about it, but just to see it on your own personal phone that you went and bought at an AT&T store, just me buying this makes me agree to them spying on me.
[00:00:59.817 --> 00:01:00.537]  Just think about that.
[00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:01.338]  That's crazy.
[00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:08.040]  Not until you open up your own phone and put in your, uh, you know, your little password, you go to settings,
[00:01:09.028 --> 00:01:09.808]  And it's right there.
[00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:11.709]  I mean, I was just like, wow.
[00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.810]  So it's not that hard.
[00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.413]  You put in your password and then I don't know how it is for, uh, for Apple, but I have a Samsung Galaxy.
[00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:21.193]  All right.
[00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:31.518]  So you get your Android device, wherever your settings button is, click on that settings button, go to general, scroll all the way down to the bottom to wherever it says about device.
[00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:36.620]  And you're going to go to legal information, open sources, licenses,
[00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:41.624]  Wait on that to load because there's quite a bit of information.
[00:01:43.525 --> 00:01:46.047]  You're going to go way down because that's how the NSA gets you.
[00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:47.187]  They want to hide this stuff.
[00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:48.268]  Way at the bottom.
[00:01:55.272 --> 00:01:57.034]  Okay, we're getting ready to come up on it.
[00:01:57.094 --> 00:01:57.494]  Here it is.
[00:01:58.134 --> 00:02:03.137]  Alright, it's a system lib4 slash libse linux dot so.
[00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:05.139]  We'll click on that.
[00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:16.484]  It says, you agree that this software is a non-commercially developed program that may contain bugs and the NSA makes no and hereby expressly disclaims all warranties.
[00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:25.770]  It also goes on to say that the NSA will not be liable for any loss of profits or loss of data on your phone.
[00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.555]  Now what that is, is the NSA is using Linux to access your information on your phone.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.284]  So this is something that they even have a Wikipedia about.
[00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:41.248]  It is the Linux SE NSA spying program type deal.
[00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:42.730]  It's been available since 2003.
[00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:52.502]  So pretty much every phone since 2003 has been a spying tool for these NSA agents.
[00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:54.572]  Just think about that.
[00:02:55.232 --> 00:03:01.694]  Every phone you've had since 2003, the things you've done, seen, talked about, pictures you've shared, pictures you've taken.
[00:03:02.074 --> 00:03:05.775]  No wonder these celebrity, you know, nude pictures are coming up because they're just out there.
[00:03:06.535 --> 00:03:07.236]  Anyone can get it.
[00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:08.696]  They don't need to steal your phone anymore.
[00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:10.917]  That's, that's child's play.
[00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:15.698]  They can just go in through these bugs and it's right there.
[00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:17.288]  Proof!
[00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:21.430]  The NSA is spying on your phone.
[00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.770]  2014 is 1984.
[00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.371]  Orwell was right.
[00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:28.052]  This handheld telescreen is spying on us right now.
[00:03:28.472 --> 00:03:30.673]  And also giving us radiation while it sits in our pocket.
[00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:32.033]  So there you have it.
[00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:34.194]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:52.979]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.319]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.120]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.281]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:05.741]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:13.023]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:04:13.223 --> 00:04:17.344]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:19.184]  We are the true media.
[00:04:19.344 --> 00:04:21.945]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:25.706]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
