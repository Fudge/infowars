[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.241]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:21.921]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:29.325]  It's Monday, January 27, 2014, and tomorrow is the big night that Obama is going to give us his State of the Union.
[00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:39.810]  Or maybe we should say it's the State of his Regime, because they put out press releases that are being echoed throughout the mainstream media about how he's going to assert his unilateral agenda.
[00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.953]  See, that's semantics for dictating what he's going to do.
[00:00:44.333 --> 00:01:04.250]  And of course, he's filing executive orders, he's usurping powers that are not given to him in the Constitution, and then he's locking up critics of his regime, he's befriending and supplying Al Qaeda terrorists, and tomorrow night he's going to talk about how he's going to use his new powers that he's assumed to bypass immigration law.
[00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.152]  Now, look at how the mainstream media is picking this up everywhere.
[00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:12.794]  The new term, this is no longer dictator, this is now assert unilateral agenda.
[00:01:12.814 --> 00:01:13.834]  You'll see this everywhere.
[00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:15.095]  This is how they operate.
[00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:20.197]  They come up with these terms, these semantic terms, that give them the high ground in an argument.
[00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:25.600]  If he were to say that he's just going to be giving executive orders, that sounds a little bit too authoritarian.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.142]  But if he says he's going to assert a unilateral agenda, it's like, oh, that just kind of sounds
[00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:34.403]  Interesting, and a lot of people are picking it up just like they picked up gravitas.
[00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:41.544]  Remember how that term was picked up out of obscurity and started echoing throughout the media many years ago to really kind of a comical term?
[00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:43.324]  Well, now you see that with this new phrase.
[00:01:43.744 --> 00:01:44.724]  And how is that going to look?
[00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:58.587]  Well, we see that just as his friends on the left are calling for him to be more of a dictator, to assert his unilateral agenda, we now see that the CFR, the Council on Foreign Relations, is calling on him to assert his friendship of Al Qaeda.
[00:01:59.187 --> 00:02:00.488]  To openly proclaim it.
[00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:01.469]  To embrace them.
[00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.132]  They've been supplying them, training them, and allying with them for quite some time.
[00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:12.698]  And of course, as Ted Cruz and Dennis Kucinich have pointed out, we were going to be acting as Al-Qaeda's air force in Syria.
[00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:15.741]  But the Council on Foreign Relations is pointing out they want him to do more.
[00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:31.332]  In an article entitled, The Good and Bad of Arar al-Sham, yes, a sham alright, an al-Qaeda linked group worth befriending, the authors even admit that the leader, quote, published a statement praising bin Laden and al-Qaeda's current chief, al-Zawahiri.
[00:02:31.872 --> 00:02:37.496]  And they said it underscored the fact that Al-Qaeda and Arar al-Sham are joined at the hip.
[00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:41.119]  Well, of course, even though they're joined at the hip, though, we should be supporting them.
[00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.762]  And we should do it, and this is what's changed, we should do it openly.
[00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:45.622]  Openly.
[00:02:45.742 --> 00:02:50.766]  They've been doing it covertly for quite some time, as we've pointed out for a very long time at InfoWars.
[00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:52.788]  Now they're going to come out and do it openly.
[00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:56.910]  Just as they're now openly persecuting political enemies.
[00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.653]  We see that D'Souza has become a target of the Obama administration.
[00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:06.856]  And the guy who produced his documentary on Obama said, I never feared my government until now.
[00:03:07.617 --> 00:03:10.339]  Now this is the same guy who produced Schindler's List.
[00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.921]  He says, I've never had the occasion to think that I had to fear my government.
[00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:18.944]  I never had the thought that I had a reason to look over my shoulder until now.
[00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:20.045]  Because why?
[00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:24.567]  Because Obama has been attacking the Tea Party with the IRS and with the FBI.
[00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:35.374]  Now he's attacking filmmakers, he's attacking political opponents, finding minor violations with his opponents while they let things like Fast and Furious and Benghazi go unaddressed.
[00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:37.114]  There's no criminal actions here.
[00:03:37.515 --> 00:03:44.637]  Now, during the Nixon administration, if you'll remember, the IRS commissioner did not execute the enemies list that Nixon gave him.
[00:03:44.697 --> 00:03:47.939]  He set it in the safe, and then he gave it to investigators later on.
[00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.220]  But on Obama's watch, exactly the opposite happens.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.342]  They audit all of these Tea Party organizations, and then the FBI works with them on the audits, and nobody gets investigated.
[00:03:58.422 --> 00:03:59.303]  No one goes to jail.
[00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:08.368]  Now, the other thing that he's going to hit when he asserts his unilateral agenda tomorrow night, the key thing that he's going to hit on is going to be immigration.
[00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:10.809]  And Senator Sessions pushed back on that today.
[00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:15.552]  He said, immigration spikes are generating income inequality.
[00:04:15.812 --> 00:04:17.133]  And he points out, he says, today the U.S.
[00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:18.954]  admits 1 million immigrants a year.
[00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:24.657]  The plan, supported by the President and Senate Democrats, would increase that to 3 million a year, or 30 million
[00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:28.280]  Unskilled immigrants over the next 10 years.
[00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:32.284]  Did anyone ask the American people if they wanted to triple immigration?
[00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:33.745]  No, of course they wouldn't.
[00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:37.208]  Because he's pursuing a unilateral agenda.
[00:04:37.448 --> 00:04:39.150]  He's not going to ask the American people.
[00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.732]  He's not going to ask Congress if they want to go along with this.
[00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:43.854]  Because he's pursuing a unilateral agenda.
[00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:47.097]  It's just, everything in the Constitution is out.
[00:04:47.457 --> 00:04:48.878]  You have no checks and balances.
[00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:52.922]  And Congress has no say because Obama's just going to execute his executive orders.
[00:04:54.045 --> 00:05:06.093]  Now, it's not just the Obama administration, but it's international bankers who are getting into the act, who are working geopolitically, as well as doing some very fishy things with currency controls and with gold.
[00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:09.195]  We've asked if we could have an audit of the Federal Reserve.
[00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:12.257]  Maybe we should ask if we can audit Fort Knox as well.
[00:05:12.737 --> 00:05:26.741]  And in Kurt Nimmo's story on Infowars today, it says, since the end of the 18th century, Ukraine formed an important part of the Russian and Soviet state, and the Russian Black Sea Fleet is located in the Crimea as a port that's leased to Russia by the Ukraine, so both the U.S.
[00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:29.342]  and the EU have an interest in weakening Russia.
[00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:38.432]  While the leaders of the resistance may be taking money from George Soros, do you really believe that the common people on the ground understand what's going on?
[00:05:38.793 --> 00:05:44.860]  They're very upset because of the genocide that Stalin committed against that region, what was called the Holomador.
[00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:49.106]  And that's something that the fellow who coined the term genocide pointed out.
[00:05:49.186 --> 00:05:50.488]  And it's interesting to look at that.
[00:05:50.508 --> 00:05:52.350]  That's what's galvanizing the people on the street.
[00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:54.333]  And there were four prongs to that attack.
[00:05:54.714 --> 00:05:56.076]  They cut off the political leadership.
[00:05:56.436 --> 00:06:01.603]  They co-opted the churches, said you're going to come along with the Russian-Soviet line or you're going to be shut down.
[00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:15.775]  They then pulled in massive immigration, which in that case were other Russians, so that they could create competing groups, so they could get people who were going to support the government, and then they starved them to death in massive numbers.
[00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:20.535]  And it's interesting that we see similar parallels, don't we, to today in America.
[00:06:20.876 --> 00:06:25.456]  We see that they're bringing in massive immigration, which will balkanize the United States.
[00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:28.237]  People who will support their socialist agenda.
[00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:29.017]  I think so.
[00:06:44.268 --> 00:06:44.889]  I think so.
[00:07:06.972 --> 00:07:15.015]  Because it's not just rumors of currency control in the example that we saw the day before with HSBC, but they're concerned about a major gold scandal.
[00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:18.576]  This is something that's been reported by Washington's blog, as well as Zero Hedge.
[00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.137]  We've been picking up their stories and running them in InfoWars.
[00:07:21.717 --> 00:07:31.101]  This article from Washington's blog today says there's a major gold scandal going mainstream, and they say that, after all, nobody knows whether there's really 260 million ounces of gold in Fort Knox.
[00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:32.441]  Because the U.S.
[00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:34.502]  government won't let auditors inside.
[00:07:34.882 --> 00:07:42.484]  And of course, we reported just last week that the German bank has been trying for a year to get their gold from the U.S.
[00:07:42.584 --> 00:07:45.725]  Federal Reserve, and they've simply refused to supply it.
[00:07:45.985 --> 00:07:59.809]  And over the last year, this is an article from the 20th that was from Zero Hedge, and they said over the last year they've only gotten 37 tons out of 674 that the German bank has on storage with the Federal Reserve.
[00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:01.289]  And the U.S.
[00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:03.890]  has only supplied five of those 37 tons.
[00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.271]  Most of it has come from France.
[00:08:05.311 --> 00:08:12.173]  Now, of course, that's only 0.7% of the gold that Germany is asking for has been supplied.
[00:08:12.213 --> 00:08:14.134]  So the question is, is the gold there?
[00:08:14.874 --> 00:08:25.598]  If a federal bank, if a central bank can refuse to give money to another central bank, do you think that they're really going to give you your fiat currency when you ask for it from the bank?
[00:08:26.198 --> 00:08:30.540]  That's exactly what we saw this weekend in the story about HSBC that I referred to.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.342]  And that's one of the things that resonated with people when they saw this initial report about currency controls in China.
[00:08:36.622 --> 00:08:37.803]  People know that it's coming.
[00:08:37.863 --> 00:08:39.763]  We've seen this happen several times in banks.
[00:08:40.044 --> 00:08:42.565]  And now this most recent one just happened over the weekend.
[00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:44.305]  Bank run fears continue.
[00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:46.846]  HSBC restricts large cash withdrawals.
[00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:47.967]  This is from Zero Hedge.
[00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:53.589]  This came out of England and we had listeners telling Radio 4's Moneybox that they were stopped
[00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:54.029]  We're good to go.
[00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:17.048]  Why should you have to give them a letter to get your money out?
[00:09:17.549 --> 00:09:20.871]  Why should the German bank have to wait for eight years to get their gold out?
[00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:22.032]  What are they doing?
[00:09:22.132 --> 00:09:28.616]  If they're not going to give the gold to a German central bank, they're not going to give you your fiat currency when push comes to shove.
[00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:35.080]  Now we're going to be right back and we're going to talk about one of the most important things that you can do to opt out of this system.
[00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:36.441]  Stay tuned.
[00:09:45.097 --> 00:09:49.500]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.062]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:09:52.382 --> 00:10:02.069]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:10:02.409 --> 00:10:10.613]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:10:10.813 --> 00:10:13.354]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:10:13.774 --> 00:10:18.016]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:10:18.396 --> 00:10:19.277]  We are the spirit of 1776.

[00:10:23.119 --> 00:10:28.361]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:32.825]  In the long march towards humanity's ultimate destiny of freedom.

[00:10:58.683 --> 00:11:06.929]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:11:07.109 --> 00:11:11.772]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:18.678]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:25.844]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:11:25.944 --> 00:11:32.829]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.313]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:11:37.453 --> 00:11:40.676]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:11:40.836 --> 00:11:46.969]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:48.813]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:04.345]  Well, Democrats like Wendy Davis, running for governor here in Texas, like to portray themselves as pro-choice because it sounds so nice.
[00:12:04.945 --> 00:12:09.728]  But are they really pro-choice about anything other than whether you choose to kill your child?
[00:12:10.348 --> 00:12:14.970]  Now, if you want to educate your child and make those kind of educational choices, they oppose that.
[00:12:15.391 --> 00:12:17.452]  They want a government monopoly on all education.
[00:12:17.472 --> 00:12:18.832]  They want to force everyone into that.
[00:12:19.213 --> 00:12:21.334]  They don't want you to make decisions about your child's health.
[00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:30.936]  Whether you should vaccinate them, make decisions about their insurance, and of course they don't want you to make decisions about most things individually in your life where you would have some choice.
[00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:36.097]  But this week we're celebrating Educational Choice Week, and we've got an article from Ron Paul.
[00:12:36.137 --> 00:12:45.299]  He says every week should be School Choice Week, and he points out when the government usurps control of education from parents, education can easily become indoctrination.
[00:12:45.925 --> 00:12:47.586]  Well, it's not a possibility.
[00:12:47.606 --> 00:12:49.428]  I would go much stronger than that.
[00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:51.830]  I would say it's not that it can become indoctrination.
[00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.792]  It was designed to be indoctrination from the very beginning.
[00:12:54.812 --> 00:13:00.276]  Of course, we have the book from Charlotte Iserby that we sell, Dumbing Us Down, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.
[00:13:00.716 --> 00:13:12.426]  And of course, this is something that's been going on since the mid-1800s, when I confronted Bill Ayers about his involvement in education, how he likes to portray himself as someone who's all about anarchy, and yet he's one of the biggest statists out there.
[00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:17.169]  He said, oh, there's never been any case where the government hasn't been involved in education.
[00:13:17.209 --> 00:13:18.149]  Well, simply isn't true.
[00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:29.357]  They got involved because back in the 1840s, in communist communities like the Oneida experiment, they were trying to reproduce things that Plato had suggested in his Plato's Republic.
[00:13:29.397 --> 00:13:33.980]  They wanted essentially to destroy the family, to cut the ties from parents to children.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.084]  They wanted the community to raise a child, the village to raise a child, if you will.
[00:13:39.364 --> 00:13:41.966]  And so they had all kinds of sexual promiscuity and
[00:13:42.586 --> 00:13:49.773]  Different definitions of marriage they were doing back then, and they realized that even though it was a failure, the reason it was a failure was because they had to get the kids earlier.
[00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:53.016]  So that's what the educational establishment has been all about.
[00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.278]  That's the purpose of government education.
[00:13:55.498 --> 00:13:59.722]  It has been designed to get your kids at an early age so they can be brainwashed.
[00:14:00.103 --> 00:14:05.628]  Now we have an article that came out today from Kit Daniels, and they want to know if they're doing a good job of brainwashing your kids.
[00:14:06.008 --> 00:14:11.895]  So they are going to have in New York a data collection program that's going to track students from preschool to their career.
[00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:13.077]  They call it P-20.
[00:14:13.638 --> 00:14:15.780]  In other words, from preschool to 20 years of age.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.223]  But of course, they're not going to stop at 20 years of age.
[00:14:18.463 --> 00:14:22.809]  Now this is being promoted by New York State and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:14:23.209 --> 00:14:38.254]  And they say, quote, it will allow NYSED, that's the New York State Education Department, and other agencies to link data without the need for agencies to unnecessarily add new regulations or seek legal policies to collect data out of their purview.
[00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:38.774]  In other words,
[00:14:39.614 --> 00:14:48.723]  They're just going to start pulling all this stuff together so they don't have to go to all that trouble of trying to come up with some kind of a legal justification for spying on you, for storing all of your information.
[00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:52.506]  Of course, every time we turn around, that is the government's main objective.
[00:14:52.546 --> 00:14:54.848]  They view you and your children as slaves.
[00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:58.331]  So one of the things you can do is get out of the system.
[00:14:58.412 --> 00:15:05.178]  That's the most effective thing you can do for yourself, for the future of this country, is to opt out of the system, to exit it.
[00:15:05.598 --> 00:15:08.680]  A good example of that is the Grammy Awards that were just last night.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.662]  Now we've got a Christian singer who went to the Grammy Awards.
[00:15:12.223 --> 00:15:15.565]  This is Natalie Grant, and she was very excited to go.
[00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:26.692]  She tweeted about how excited she was to be there, but after she started watching what she called satanic performances, and many others have called them that, she tweeted that, I'm leaving early, and maybe I've seen a little bit too much.
[00:15:26.752 --> 00:15:29.214]  I'm glad that I'm singing for Jesus, essentially what she said.
[00:15:29.494 --> 00:15:30.415]  But even E!
[00:15:30.675 --> 00:15:35.138]  Online said, did we just witness actual witchcraft during Katy Perry's Grammy performance?
[00:15:35.618 --> 00:15:37.039]  Well, I think they did.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:45.226]  And we're going to have an interview with Joy Camp, who did a wonderful job of parroting exactly what went on at the Grammys.
[00:15:45.246 --> 00:15:51.751]  They've come out with their agenda, just like Al Qaeda is now obviously the friend of Obama, and they've come out with that agenda.
[00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:52.312]  So stay tuned.
[00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:55.955]  We're going to have that interview with Joy Camp and a very funny video right after the break.
[00:16:04.608 --> 00:16:10.193]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:16:10.413 --> 00:16:17.640]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.043]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:16:21.163 --> 00:16:22.944]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:16:23.204 --> 00:16:27.748]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:16:27.848 --> 00:16:30.571]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:16:30.731 --> 00:16:36.517]  Nascent Iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:16:36.697 --> 00:16:40.180]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:16:40.381 --> 00:16:45.406]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of Nascent Iodine.

[00:18:16.032 --> 00:18:17.393]  Benny, what's wrong?
[00:18:17.733 --> 00:18:19.754]  I'm just a little woozy, Kevin.
[00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:22.355]  What are you woozy from, Benny?
[00:18:22.595 --> 00:18:26.537]  Well, I've been signing contracts in blood all day.
[00:18:26.557 --> 00:18:32.459]  Yeah.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.180]  Blood?
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.341]  That's nothing.
[00:18:35.901 --> 00:18:39.182]  I had to sell my soul to be famous.
[00:18:41.983 --> 00:18:43.044]  Thank you very much, Jay-Z.
[00:18:45.014 --> 00:18:48.399]  You're welcome!
[00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:53.948]  This year's nominees for the Illuminati Puppet of the Year are...
[00:18:57.031 --> 00:19:06.400]  Lil Wayne for Love Me, a song about how much traumatized women trapped in cages love Lil Wayne, featuring butterflies, Satan, and a bathtub full of blood.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:19.031]  Azealia Banks for Young Rapunzel, the story of a person with little to no control over their own mind, bending over backward to a police state and surrounded by owls, eyes, and some all-around weirdness.
[00:19:20.052 --> 00:19:23.013]  Miley Cyrus for everything she did in 2013.
[00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:32.977]  Whether she was twerking, tongue-wagging, or panty-dropping, this former Disney poster girl turned innocence and wholesomeness into sleaze and trash faster than you could say Hannah Montana.
[00:19:33.557 --> 00:19:43.741]  Katy Perry for PRISM, an album targeted at children that conveniently shares its name with another breakout star from 2013, the NSA's PRISM surveillance program.
[00:19:44.421 --> 00:19:51.326]  And last but not least, perennial nominee Lady Gaga for Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular.
[00:19:51.586 --> 00:19:56.590]  3.6 million viewers tuned in to watch this Illuminati favorite flash the one-eye sign to Kermit and the gang.
[00:19:57.011 --> 00:19:59.973]  Being vacuous, soulless, and shallow never looked so good.
[00:20:00.413 --> 00:20:00.993]  Or endearing.
[00:20:04.116 --> 00:20:09.039]  Boy, Gaga sure is Gaga over that all-seeing eye.
[00:20:14.757 --> 00:20:20.243]  Uh, before we go, we'd like to thank the five corporations that own and produce every single media outlet.
[00:20:21.084 --> 00:20:24.828]  AOL, Time Warner, Disney, Universal, Sony.
[00:20:24.948 --> 00:20:26.990]  Without you, none of this would exist.
[00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.051]  Thank you, goodnight!
[00:20:32.782 --> 00:20:38.086]  That was one of the latest videos from Joy Camp, a parody of the propaganda pageant known as the Grammys.
[00:20:38.386 --> 00:20:42.749]  And to tell us more about this, we have the creators of Joy Camp, Benny Wills and Kevin Kostelnik.
[00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:44.330]  They join us now via Skype.
[00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.232]  Benny, Kevin, thanks for joining us, guys.
[00:20:46.952 --> 00:20:47.612]  Thanks for having us.
[00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:48.133]  Thank you.
[00:20:48.393 --> 00:20:52.456]  So we saw your most recent video and also some of the other things you did with InfoWars.
[00:20:52.476 --> 00:20:53.837]  We'll talk about that here in a little bit.
[00:20:54.277 --> 00:21:01.001]  But the most recent video you did about the Grammys, and I was very surprised when I saw, you know, pretty much how accurate you guys were with Beyonce.
[00:21:01.041 --> 00:21:11.508]  You know, she's taking off her bra and tossing it in your video, but in real life, she didn't quite go that far, but she's running around the stage in some booty shorts, and it wasn't too far-fetched from what you guys predicted would happen.
[00:21:12.429 --> 00:21:13.630]  Well, it's all spectacle, man.
[00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.550]  I'm not surprised at all.
[00:21:15.111 --> 00:21:15.351]  Yeah.
[00:21:16.502 --> 00:21:32.571]  Yeah, so it's one of the things that you really don't want your kids to watch anymore, and not just that, but many other performances, performances in the past, and you know, maybe you guys are like me and you didn't waste your time actually watching the Grammys, but just to see these things happen, it's very unsettling.
[00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:36.113]  Yeah, it is, and it's just absurd.
[00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:39.034]  I mean, that's I guess where the idea for the video came from.
[00:21:39.054 --> 00:21:41.376]  I mean, this stuff is really just ridiculous.
[00:21:41.396 --> 00:21:43.057]  I mean, the music industry in particular is
[00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:49.553]  It's just obnoxious with their symbolism, with their escapades.
[00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:58.537]  Yeah, we're both really big music lovers, and there's so much good music out there, like so much good music that just doesn't get noticed by anyone.
[00:21:59.037 --> 00:22:07.542]  And then you watch something like the Grammys, which I didn't watch, and I haven't... I watched enough Grammy footage from making this video to last me a lifetime.
[00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:09.022]  I got really sick of
[00:22:10.583 --> 00:22:22.073]  The video footage that I was watching, so I didn't see any of the new stuff, but the music that these people, when they win these awards for the music that they make, is just... I don't know how you make it listen to it, really.
[00:22:22.393 --> 00:22:31.201]  Yeah, just real horrible stuff, and you guys pointed that out in your video talking about the music of Miley Cyrus, and not only that, but Lil Wayne, Beyonce, others, but on Lil Wayne,
[00:22:31.921 --> 00:22:40.707]  The video you guys portrayed is a very disturbing video for no other reason than just its content, regardless of any Illuminati or other things that are going on.
[00:22:40.767 --> 00:22:42.969]  It's just a straight-up disturbing video.
[00:22:43.309 --> 00:22:45.291]  Right, and that's directed at kids.
[00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:49.233]  I mean, this pop music, let's face it, is basically for teenagers.
[00:22:49.654 --> 00:22:53.456]  This is what they're being subjected to, and they don't realize necessarily what they're watching.
[00:22:53.476 --> 00:22:55.318]  So why are they putting it in their videos?
[00:22:55.398 --> 00:22:56.919]  Why is there a bathtub full of blood?
[00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:58.460]  There's absolutely no reason for it.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:05.862]  Yeah, and then the Azealia Banks video, when we both watched that for the first time a couple of weeks ago, it just blew my mind.
[00:23:07.263 --> 00:23:21.168]  The music industry is so in your face with the symbolism, and like he said, it's targeted at young kids, so they grow up idolizing these people who couldn't be further from a real person that you should idolize at all.
[00:23:21.228 --> 00:23:22.028]  It's just insane.
[00:23:22.148 --> 00:23:24.949]  And that video in particular is scary because I think it has a double message.
[00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:30.015]  First they show Azealia Banks trying to fight this police state that is coming in on her.
[00:23:30.055 --> 00:23:33.179]  So they're with their, you know, like a SWAT team with their shields.
[00:23:33.519 --> 00:23:36.563]  They're coming at her and she's trying to fight them and she can't.
[00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:40.868]  She like breaks a bottle over their shield and the next thing you know she's bending over backwards to the police state.
[00:23:40.888 --> 00:23:42.350]  So I get from that that...
[00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:47.955]  The police state is coming, and it's useless to fight them, because you are powerless against it.
[00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:49.476]  That's what I got from that video.
[00:23:49.516 --> 00:23:51.817]  That's a very good observation, and not just in the music.
[00:23:51.857 --> 00:23:54.299]  We see it in the movies and many different things.
[00:23:54.339 --> 00:23:55.740]  Just bow down to the police state.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.701]  Drones are good.
[00:23:56.721 --> 00:23:58.222]  The police state will save you.
[00:23:58.242 --> 00:24:01.825]  You see this in all number of movies, and just entertainment in general.
[00:24:01.865 --> 00:24:03.146]  Why do you guys think that is?
[00:24:03.166 --> 00:24:06.348]  You guys have a finger on the pulse in the entertainment community.
[00:24:06.368 --> 00:24:07.089]  Why do you think that is?
[00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:12.936]  Uh, I think, yeah, because it's like, um, how would I describe it?
[00:24:13.757 --> 00:24:14.917]  They're letting you know that it's there.
[00:24:14.938 --> 00:24:16.238]  They're saying, this is coming.
[00:24:16.358 --> 00:24:18.260]  This is here to stay.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.161]  And we want you to get pissed off about it.
[00:24:20.201 --> 00:24:24.964]  We want you to get mad that it's here so that you'll try to fight it, but then they'll just squash you right away.
[00:24:24.984 --> 00:24:27.786]  I mean, that's what I'm getting from it.
[00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:31.008]  They're not trying to hide it from the public anymore.
[00:24:31.028 --> 00:24:32.108]  They're saying, here it is.
[00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:34.070]  And if you don't like it, yeah, fight it.
[00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.370]  We'll just squash you anyway.
[00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.331]  That's what I get from it.
[00:24:36.411 --> 00:24:37.852]  Yeah, and it's also Hollywood.
[00:24:37.912 --> 00:24:42.635]  I mean, you know, we live out here and it really is like a gigantic arm of the system.
[00:24:42.715 --> 00:24:45.037]  It's one of the most powerful arms, I think, of the system.
[00:24:45.637 --> 00:24:54.623]  And so with the movies and the music business are just really powerful driving forces for them to steer people in all the wrong directions.
[00:24:54.704 --> 00:25:00.688]  So when we plan ourselves in videos like this, we hope to, like, make fun of that and expose that and steer people
[00:25:01.408 --> 00:25:02.148]  In the right direction.
[00:25:02.228 --> 00:25:06.090]  Yeah, and just say that the best defense against it is to laugh at it.
[00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.712]  So we don't necessarily try to fight it, we just say, you know what, we're not going to play the game.
[00:25:10.852 --> 00:25:12.072]  We're not going to give into it at all.
[00:25:12.132 --> 00:25:15.294]  And not only that, but we're going to laugh at you for you being a part of the game.
[00:25:15.334 --> 00:25:16.454]  Yeah, it's all an illusion.
[00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:23.377]  I gotta tell you, man, it felt so good to make fun of some of these people in our video because after watching... Which one was your favorite to make fun of?
[00:25:24.966 --> 00:25:27.209]  Probably Jay-Z for me.
[00:25:27.309 --> 00:25:27.950]  I think Jay-Z.
[00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.031]  Jay-Z for me too.
[00:25:29.051 --> 00:25:33.516]  We've been wanting to make fun of Jay-Z in the music industry for a really long time.
[00:25:33.536 --> 00:25:34.897]  In all this business.
[00:25:34.917 --> 00:25:38.722]  They're going to screen cap that and say you guys are Illuminati now.
[00:25:38.762 --> 00:25:40.824]  I know, that's exactly what they're going to do.
[00:25:40.844 --> 00:25:42.165]  I think there's already been a comment on that.
[00:25:42.245 --> 00:25:44.348]  We take it as a compliment when people think we're double agents.
[00:25:44.608 --> 00:25:54.555]  And especially with these videos, the award shows, because what happens is we make these videos obviously aware of the timing on them and we put it out before it comes out.
[00:25:54.695 --> 00:25:59.538]  We call it like a leaked clip so that if we get enough traction within our alternative media community,
[00:26:00.038 --> 00:26:02.619]  It'll result in the video being one of the top searches.
[00:26:02.659 --> 00:26:16.723]  So when you get just like average Joe Schmo that goes and searches for the Grammys 2014, our video pops up, you know, on the front page and they'll click on it thinking they're going to see something from the Grammys and then all of a sudden they get, you know, planted with this little seed of truth.
[00:26:17.043 --> 00:26:21.624]  And usually when that happens, we get an influx of views, an influx of really negative comments.
[00:26:21.765 --> 00:26:26.386]  We didn't get too many this time, but when we get those, I always see those as a victory because
[00:26:26.886 --> 00:26:34.612]  Somebody watched it all the way through, enough to where it invokes something in them to write something that just went against their grain of thinking.
[00:26:34.992 --> 00:26:35.833]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:26:35.853 --> 00:26:37.294]  I'm sorry guys, we've got to move here quick.
[00:26:38.235 --> 00:26:42.799]  I really want to touch on what you guys said about just being active and being in this fight at some level.
[00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:47.182]  Some people think that it's all about sitting in a suit and being on TV or being on the radio like Alex.
[00:26:47.442 --> 00:26:51.245]  Just doing a fun parody video like you guys did could really wake up a lot of people.
[00:26:51.545 --> 00:26:53.267]  Now quickly, the Super Bowl is coming up.
[00:26:53.607 --> 00:26:58.754]  We've seen a lot of weird things going on with Madonna, Beyonce, other people as well.
[00:26:58.774 --> 00:27:01.317]  Do you guys anticipate anything for this year's Super Bowl?
[00:27:02.906 --> 00:27:03.807]  There's gotta be something.
[00:27:04.207 --> 00:27:09.051]  The halftime show has turned into a really ritualistic event.
[00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:11.292]  I mean, that thing is scary year after year.
[00:27:11.312 --> 00:27:12.613]  Scarier every year, actually.
[00:27:12.633 --> 00:27:16.216]  Yeah, it's a giant platform for the system, so there will be something, I'm sure.
[00:27:16.236 --> 00:27:23.361]  And of course, the distraction that sports are, and football in specific, and the focus on commercial advertising.
[00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:25.983]  How bizarre is that, that we get excited for commercials?
[00:27:27.664 --> 00:27:31.847]  The halftime commercials are one of the biggest things about the Super Bowl in general.
[00:27:31.887 --> 00:27:37.230]  Now, in closing guys, we've seen you guys participate in our contest here at InfoWars.
[00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:41.393]  You recently made the TSA video for our contest there.
[00:27:41.453 --> 00:27:42.093]  It was a great video.
[00:27:42.113 --> 00:27:44.495]  You guys also did some other things in Operation Paul Revere.
[00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:47.957]  So Kevin, guys, you guys do a great job over there.
[00:27:47.978 --> 00:27:49.559]  Just keep doing what you're doing.
[00:27:49.579 --> 00:27:52.621]  That's what you need to do, because that's what we need to do to wake people up.
[00:27:52.721 --> 00:27:56.184]  Benny as well, you guys are all in it, as well as the other guys in your crew.
[00:27:56.204 --> 00:27:58.526]  I know you guys have other people that come in and work on your behalf.
[00:27:58.546 --> 00:28:00.407]  All right, Joey Camp, thank you guys for your time.
[00:28:01.048 --> 00:28:01.769]  Thanks so much.
