[00:00:01.556 --> 00:00:13.725]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is unprecedented for any major Western government to openly take someone with something as deadly as Ebola into their country.
[00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:18.689]  Germany has now done it with Ebola patients, so has the United States.
[00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.114]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a PSYOP to create terror and to fearmonger and to bring in a greater medical tyranny.
[00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:26.835]  Bottom line.
[00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:31.655]  But the issue is, even old bioweapons labs that were off the U.S.
[00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:41.558]  coast, like Plum Island, infected the United States with weaponized, tick-borne syphilis that the public knows as Lyme's disease.
[00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:43.619]  It's in the syphilis family on record.
[00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.440]  And that's where it came from, that zoological bioweapons lab.
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.181]  So the point is, this stuff can and will get out.
[00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:56.442]  But now, they're just bringing it directly to a hospital, and I looked the hospital up.
[00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:00.402]  It's got level 2 containment, where they have a special wing.
[00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:06.343]  Level 4 is what bioweapon hazards like Ebola are supposed to be in.
[00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:09.864]  Underground, with minefields around it, machine gun nests.
[00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:14.385]  If it gets out inside the facility, they hit a button, and the place burns down.
[00:01:15.085 --> 00:01:20.226]  Huge canisters of natural gas are released, like torches, and everything is burned to the ground.
[00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:22.434]  Okay, it's supposed to be underground.
[00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:30.619]  Now this, this is about a government and a political system that doesn't care about the people as well, that are flirting with disaster.
[00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:38.685]  You've all seen the headlines about a FedEx truck crashing and it had weaponized flu on it that kills over 90% of people that come in contact with it seven years ago.
[00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:39.954]  I think?
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.402]  The designs for stuff like this out on the internet.
[00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:10.468]  They want plausible deniability down the road when the eugenicists, the globalists, carry out a 12 monkeys type scenario.
[00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:12.349]  And they're on record talking about that.
[00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:19.815]  Dr. Eric Bianca right here at UT in Austin talks about how they need airborne Ebola to kill 90% of the world's population to save the earth.
[00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:21.456]  So that's clearly what's happening.
[00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:24.919]  But regardless of why they're doing it, this is endangering the public.
[00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.783]  This is in precedent setting and they never acted like this or did this before.
[00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:32.985]  So you've got to ask yourself, why is that happening?
[00:02:33.165 --> 00:02:34.146]  Let's look at these headlines.
[00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:39.170]  Ebola patient walks into Atlanta hospital, CNN.
[00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.313]  American physician with Ebola virus arrives in Atlanta for treatment.
[00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:44.754]  What's it really all about?
[00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:46.875]  Well this story we put out last week went viral.
[00:02:47.256 --> 00:02:48.977]  You'd think mainstream media would want to point it out.
[00:02:49.277 --> 00:02:50.839]  Obama signed an executive order
[00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:59.386]  To disappear American citizens if you even have a cough and to basically lock you up in a prison.
[00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:03.370]  So they're using this to set the precedent for medical tyranny.
[00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.811]  That's one of the reasons.
[00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.352]  Here's another one.
[00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:09.896]  Possible evacuation of Americans infected with Ebola triggers fears in US.
[00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.350]  Okay.
[00:03:11.871 --> 00:03:14.092]  And that's breaking down our report.
[00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:19.136]  They mentioned InfoWars.com in this report posted on the Fox site.
[00:03:19.676 --> 00:03:22.999]  If Ebola hits U.S., even healthy Americans will be quarantined.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.682]  Well persons who do not show symptoms would be forcibly detained.
[00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:36.969]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, our southern border is wide open right now, but we're being told that that's okay and they're releasing sick people.
[00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:42.219]  But the American people themselves can be secretly locked up and disappeared.
[00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:48.141]  This is all about a power grab, all about a PSYOP of the Ebola to set up the medical tyranny state.
[00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:52.682]  We'll report on all this tomorrow on the Sunday transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:03:52.722 --> 00:03:55.523]  Central, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:58.464]  Follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[00:03:58.904 --> 00:03:59.464]  And finally,
[00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:04.707]  This is all about the insanity of a system that's getting more and more reckless.
[00:04:05.588 --> 00:04:07.489]  90 plus percent of the reactors are now leaking.
[00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:08.810]  No one even cares about that.
[00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.332]  It's an elite that's so decadent they could care less.
[00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.173]  So it's more than just fear-mongering.
[00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:19.196]  It's also part of their nihilistic disconnection with reality, thinking they're invincible.
[00:04:19.636 --> 00:04:20.937]  Pride goes before a fall.
[00:04:21.357 --> 00:04:23.239]  Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com.
