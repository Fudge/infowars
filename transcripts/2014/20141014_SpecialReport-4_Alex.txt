[00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:14.113]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com in McAllen, Texas, on the border of Mexico.
[00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:20.676]  Now, to my left and to my right, we have two Humvees with Air Force and Army personnel.
[00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:25.317]  I think the highest ranking person I saw was a regular Sergeant, an E-5.
[00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:29.539]  And what they're essentially doing is watching over the border.
[00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:36.902]  Now, is this happening in light of the fact that General Kelly, the general, the commanding officer of SOUTHCOM, has come out
[00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:42.905]  And said that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a legitimate threat.
[00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:51.150]  And what he fears is that these patients, people who contract the virus, are trying to get away to get help.
[00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:59.095]  And his big worry is, what he thinks is a very liable threat, is that these people are going to come into Central America.
[00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.397]  Now once that happens, they'll begin to show signs and symptoms.
[00:01:02.797 --> 00:01:02.957]  I don't
[00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:37.649]  You were pretty much up a creek without a paddle so what he thinks is going to happen is a lot of these patients are going to come over and they're going to start pushing up to America because they feel like that's their best case of surviving so now you can see that this might not be anything I mean
[00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.951]  They are starting to take this seriously.
[00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:44.594]  I mean, like I said, we have military on both sides of me right now, border patrol.
[00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:52.221]  Earlier we were at a park down the road where there was a huge presence of border patrol, police officers, helicopters in the air.
[00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:58.686]  You know, I've been coming here doing reports for the past few months, and I've never seen this many people out here before yet.
[00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.168]  So this is something to take into consideration.
[00:02:01.528 --> 00:02:04.030]  Once again, it's nothing to scare you, but think about it.
[00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:06.873]  You know, if they're out here taking this kind of effort,
[00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:12.575]  To bring military out to guard this area, there must be something that they're not telling us.
[00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:15.957]  So keep your eyes open, continue to watch our reports.
[00:02:16.197 --> 00:02:20.699]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com in this Ebola military hot zone.
[00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:39.814]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:02:40.275 --> 00:02:49.985]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:54.068]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.292]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:05.898]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:08.500]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.602]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:17.487]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:24.593]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
