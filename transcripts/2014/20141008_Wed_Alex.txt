[00:00:04.912 --> 00:00:06.233]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.993]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:09.754]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.754 --> 00:00:11.335]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:12.895]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:17.077]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.077 --> 00:00:21.919]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.181]  Thomas Eric Duncan was pronounced dead at 7.51 a.m.
[00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:30.143]  this morning at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.
[00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:41.598]  He is the first confirmed Ebola death in the United States confirmed.
[00:00:41.598 --> 00:00:50.703]  That is the Associated Press and of course it's been reported that he knew he had Ebola and fled to the United States seeking treatment.
[00:00:50.703 --> 00:01:02.190]  And the UN numbers and their different metric computer models show 1.4 to 5 plus million that it's believed will end up contracting Ebola
[00:01:03.317 --> 00:01:09.119]  And all the other nations are either sealing their borders or putting in serious restrictions and banning flights.
[00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.180]  We are not.
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.582]  The United States is now a giant dumpster for the Ebola virus.
[00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:44.426]  Just like we're the dumpster for GMO crops, and the dumpster for vaccines, and the dumpster for everybody to have kids, and then they come here and get paid for, and the dumpster for anybody who's sick to come here and get paid for, unless you're a citizen, black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter, then you get put on a death panel, or you're a veteran, you don't get any health care, you get put on a secret death panel, because they want to incentivize the third world flooding, unskilled, balkanized, Tower of Babel,
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.282]  Tower of Babel, so we can't communicate with each other.
[00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:51.063]  So that's coming up.
[00:01:51.063 --> 00:01:55.045]  Michael Savage is going to be on for a full hour via video feed.
[00:01:55.045 --> 00:02:01.748]  We're not just radio, we're slash TV, Infowars.com, forward slash show for the free feed, michaelsavage.com.
[00:02:01.748 --> 00:02:06.691]  I heard about this book a few months ago, and I got to be honest with you, I never put out Obama Deception 2.
[00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:10.593]  I made the film three times, and then it's always old, and I never released it.
[00:02:10.593 --> 00:02:14.555]  I have this problem for four or five years, I just want to make a film so good, I never release it.
[00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:28.912]  This is the subtitle of the Obama Deception 2 that never came out, was basically the Obama Deception, the coming American Civil War.
[00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.670]  And it's not that I'm ripping off savages, he's ripping me off.
[00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.610]  We're both smart, of course you have to be smart now to see this, to have common sense.
[00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.151]  This country is cruising towards civil war.
[00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:45.952]  The collectivist, the progressives, and their controllers are going to push until there's nowhere else to run.
[00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:49.173]  We're not looking for a fight, they're just going to push it.
[00:02:49.173 --> 00:02:52.193]  Stop the coming civil war.
[00:02:52.193 --> 00:02:56.614]  My savage truth, Michael Savage, and I just can't put this book down.
[00:02:56.614 --> 00:03:00.135]  We just got it a couple days ago, and I think it may be his best ever.
[00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:06.006]  He's going to be joining us, coming up for a full hour in the second hour today.
[00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:16.457]  In fact, tweet for me that Michael Savage will join us for an hour live with a link to the free video audio feed page.
[00:03:16.457 --> 00:03:24.646]  And put another tweet out, a quote from Alex Jones, that Michael Savage's new book, Stop the Coming Civil War,
[00:03:26.522 --> 00:03:29.703]  Maybe one of the most important books ever written.
[00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:39.566]  And the reason I say that is, if we don't stop the staged civil war they're planning, you've heard me like a parrot saying this for about six, seven years, they're clearly gearing up for it.
[00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:43.787]  Homeland Security is designed to win the globalist takeover against the Republic.
[00:03:43.787 --> 00:03:46.728]  And they're going to trigger a false civil war to do it.
[00:03:46.728 --> 00:03:49.669]  We expose that, and that it's illegitimate.
[00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.830]  Not the people in Homeland Security on average.
[00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.070]  On average, they're actually good people.
[00:03:54.383 --> 00:04:01.785]  I didn't used to say that until I actually did more research and ran into more of them and found out they're really freaked out because they know how real this is.
[00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:04.026]  They know the treasonous mission they've been given.
[00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:07.627]  They signed on like they were really going to fight Al-Qaeda or something.
[00:04:07.627 --> 00:04:13.169]  Not spy on pro-life groups and tea parties and churches and prepare for martial law and gun confiscation.
[00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.630]  Plus they're not stupid.
[00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.311]  They know the civil war won't be fun for them, I will assure you.
[00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.711]  And it won't be fun for us either.
[00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:22.012]  So the battle lines are drawn.
[00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:25.668]  And I'm not, I don't have any stock in this book.
[00:04:25.668 --> 00:04:28.870]  I told Weldon I want him to carry this book when I got it a few days ago.
[00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.492]  I don't know if we're doing that yet, but it's hitting bookstores very soon.
[00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:36.334]  But Michael Savage believes the time is now and America is at the breaking point.
[00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:38.455]  Yeah, there's no beliefs about it.
[00:04:38.455 --> 00:04:47.660]  This is prima facie and anyone who doesn't understand we're on the verge of a design collapse and civil war to fully destroy the Republic
[00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:49.974]  Is absolutely out of their mind.
[00:04:49.974 --> 00:04:51.356]  Michael Savage will be joining us.
[00:04:51.356 --> 00:04:53.438]  The latest on Ebola.
[00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:55.321]  Confirmed Al Qaeda crossing the border.
[00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:56.142]  And more, coming up.
[00:04:58.911 --> 00:04:59.991]  DNA Force.
[00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:03.252]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:04.413]  DNA Force.
[00:05:04.413 --> 00:05:12.576]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:12.576 --> 00:05:17.657]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:17.657 --> 00:05:18.698]  DNA Force.
[00:05:18.698 --> 00:05:20.698]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[00:05:20.698 --> 00:05:25.060]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.860]  DNA Force.
[00:05:29.102 --> 00:05:32.763]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:32.763 --> 00:05:37.044]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:37.044 --> 00:05:38.824]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:38.824 --> 00:05:46.686]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:46.686 --> 00:05:47.826]  But for how long?
[00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:54.467]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:57.268]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:00.086]  Another major health threat.
[00:06:00.086 --> 00:06:05.068]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the waters.
[00:06:05.068 --> 00:06:07.729]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:14.771]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:17.752]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:20.713]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.733]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:25.594]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:31.378]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:06:31.378 --> 00:06:34.880]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.982]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:06:37.982 --> 00:06:45.306]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:48.528]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[00:06:48.528 --> 00:06:54.792]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System.
[00:06:54.932 --> 00:06:58.554]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:58.554 --> 00:07:05.718]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:08.059]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:13.341]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:18.304]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:21.826]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:21.826 --> 00:07:25.908]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:25.908 --> 00:07:30.230]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:40.456]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:40.456 --> 00:07:42.977]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:45.179]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:45.759]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:20.432]  Most syndicated radio talk show hosts do not have other syndicated radio talk show hosts on.
[00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:33.704]  I have anybody on the broadcast that wants to try to save this country, wants to preserve the right of private property, the right to practice your religion, the right to self-defense, the right to be a parent, the right to not be a slave.
[00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:41.334]  But I tell you, I agree with about 97% of what Michael Savage talks about and breaks down.
[00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:43.636]  And I'm always honored to have him on the show.
[00:08:43.636 --> 00:08:44.877]  I've been on his show a few times.
[00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:48.661]  He has our reporters on, on a routine basis.
[00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:51.143]  And no one understands what's going on in the world.
[00:08:52.493 --> 00:08:52.893]  All right.
[00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:31.402]  I could make it in about a month now because I've just got all this bombshell material that all ties together, but I've been so busy with the TV end of things and covering Ebola and deaths in my family and illnesses in the family, that's why I wasn't here yesterday, and just all hell breaking loose, quite frankly, that I never got it out.
[00:09:31.402 --> 00:09:35.124]  Then I always have to restart the film.
[00:09:35.124 --> 00:09:39.427]  I intend to get with Rob Jacobson and some of the other crew and just take what we've got and just put it out.
[00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:49.784]  Because the last working title, I don't want to give out the exact title, was The Obama Deception.
[00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:53.727]  The Second American Civil War, basically.
[00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:59.270]  Well, what Savage's new book called, and since I started reading it, I can't put it down, Stop the Coming Civil War.
[00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:04.494]  That's why I'm saying it could be one of the most important books of our time.
[00:10:04.494 --> 00:10:08.837]  Because if America has a staged civil war, it will change world history forever,
[00:10:09.884 --> 00:10:14.128]  And could trigger things that make Nazi Germany look like a tea party.
[00:10:14.128 --> 00:10:17.491]  A cakewalk.
[00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:26.759]  And if you're a sociologist, an anthropologist, a historian, if you have wide-ranging historical understanding, it is a no-brainer what Savage says in this book.
[00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:29.522]  In fact, it is a guarantee.
[00:10:29.522 --> 00:10:34.046]  You smoke five packs of cigarettes a day for 25 years, you're gonna get emphysema or lung cancer.
[00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:43.042]  You jump off a thousand foot cliff without a parachute, and it has a rocky bottom, you're gonna die on the bottom.
[00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:46.104]  You boil water, it's gonna boil.
[00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:51.148]  You slit your wrist with a hatchet or a knife, you're gonna bleed to death.
[00:10:51.148 --> 00:10:59.756]  What he says in this book, and it's not that I'm following Savage or he's following me, even though we do follow each other, it's that it's common sense, folks,
[00:11:00.834 --> 00:11:07.019]  But if we don't get this common sense out to people, the globalists are going to stage a civil war to bring this country down.
[00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:07.980]  That's their plan.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:14.125]  It's the only way they can take over, and it's what all their preparations are for, and what they admit they're getting ready for.
[00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:20.451]  So we salute Savage for being prolific, and I don't know, he's probably written 50-something books, a bunch of them, number one New York Times bestsellers.
[00:11:24.793 --> 00:11:26.234]  He's joining us in the next hour.
[00:11:26.234 --> 00:11:36.803]  Very important issue because all we're worried about Ebola and a lot of other easy, you know, to cover issues that, you know, are obviously something even mainstream media covers.
[00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:49.293]  It's the hard issues, as scary as Ebola is, like this, that are complex, real world, and so serious that have to be dealt with.
[00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:51.935]  So we're going to break down in the second hour the real plan.
[00:11:53.058 --> 00:12:06.194]  And if a plan is exposed before you launch it, if you know about the bank robber's plan, a week before they pull off the job, you don't know when they're going to hit the bank exactly, but you know they're going to hit it the next week, what can you do?
[00:12:06.194 --> 00:12:10.019]  You can probably find their hideout before they do it, or you can at least be waiting on them when they show up.
[00:12:11.462 --> 00:12:16.523]  Don't say that we didn't have the drop on them or the jump on them, okay?
[00:12:16.523 --> 00:12:18.624]  We do if you pay attention.
[00:12:18.624 --> 00:12:25.566]  And I'm getting chills right now because this is so epic, it's so historical, it's so real, it's so hardcore.
[00:12:25.566 --> 00:12:28.586]  So we salute Savage for trying to put a spotlight on this.
[00:12:28.586 --> 00:12:32.787]  We harp on it every day here.
[00:12:32.787 --> 00:12:34.868]  And so does Savage.
[00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:36.488]  And no one is plagiarizing the other.
[00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:38.469]  We're looking at the same thing coming down the road here.
[00:12:40.555 --> 00:12:42.696]  And quite frankly, it's not rocket science.
[00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:50.258]  He puts it together in an easy-to-read rocket science for dummies fashion.
[00:12:50.258 --> 00:12:53.299]  But it's guaranteed.
[00:12:53.299 --> 00:12:57.700]  The collectivists, socialists and their financial backers that want a monopoly
[00:13:00.388 --> 00:13:01.950]  Are going to pull this off.
[00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.552]  They're going to go for broke.
[00:13:03.552 --> 00:13:04.573]  Fortune favors the bold.
[00:13:04.573 --> 00:13:05.474]  They know that.
[00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:07.837]  Well, fortune favors the bold on both sides.
[00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:11.942]  Our treasure is liberty and freedom and justice and not being slaves and having dignity.
[00:13:11.942 --> 00:13:15.987]  We either get involved now, ladies and gentlemen, or we're going to lose everything.
[00:13:15.987 --> 00:13:18.310]  That is the end of the second hour today.
[00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.532]  Stop the coming civil war.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.483]  We ought to have a weekly report called that, because that's what's being geared up for.
[00:13:26.483 --> 00:13:40.151]  The entire infrastructure of Homeland Security was started for Al Qaeda, but then flipped over to the Tea Party, veterans got owners, Christians, anti-Gene21 groups, private property groups.
[00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:47.876]  I mean, basically, if you're a good organization that George Washington would like, if you were a moderate to George Washington, even a
[00:13:49.002 --> 00:13:52.083]  Liberal, because he was a conservative and didn't agree with a lot of what Thomas Jefferson had to say.
[00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:55.025]  Those of you who are true conservative would be George Washington.
[00:13:55.025 --> 00:13:56.365]  Liberal would be Thomas Jefferson.
[00:13:56.365 --> 00:13:57.506]  I admire both of them.
[00:13:57.506 --> 00:14:01.267]  Great thinkers.
[00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:05.909]  If you basically are like Thomas Jefferson, the so-called liberals hate your guts the most.
[00:14:05.909 --> 00:14:09.671]  Because they are the antithesis of a liberal.
[00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:10.491]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:14:10.491 --> 00:14:15.394]  I'm more of a Thomas Jefferson, even though I super admire George Washington.
[00:14:15.394 --> 00:14:17.214]  I'm more of a Thomas Jefferson.
[00:14:17.214 --> 00:14:18.175]  A classical liberal.
[00:14:19.339 --> 00:14:21.260]  And I bet when I ask Savage this, he'll agree.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.422]  I'll say, you're a classical liberal, aren't you, in the vein of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:14:24.422 --> 00:14:29.384]  And I bet money he agrees, because I've read his books, I've listened to him, I know what he stands for.
[00:14:29.384 --> 00:14:33.846]  Doesn't mean he hasn't made mistakes or, you know, said things he probably shouldn't have, all of us have.
[00:14:33.846 --> 00:14:39.109]  But at the end of the day, he doesn't want to see the Republic fall, so he's going to be joining us.
[00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:44.612]  Now let's get to the really serious news that's currently taking place on the economy, on the wars.
[00:14:45.954 --> 00:14:47.875]  On Ebola, obviously it's huge.
[00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:50.136]  This was just announced in the last hour.
[00:14:50.136 --> 00:14:57.781]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:14:57.781 --> 00:15:00.442]  First Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S.
[00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:01.583]  has died, A.P.
[00:15:01.583 --> 00:15:02.483]  Dallas.
[00:15:02.483 --> 00:15:05.145]  The first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States died today.
[00:15:06.243 --> 00:15:14.127]  This morning at Dallas Hospital, according to a hospital spokesman, Thomas Eric Duncan was pronounced dead at 7.51 a.m.
[00:15:14.127 --> 00:15:22.992]  at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where he was admitted September 28th and has been kept in isolation, according to spokesman Wendell Watson.
[00:15:22.992 --> 00:15:24.693]  Yeah, shouldn't have been in a regular hospital.
[00:15:24.693 --> 00:15:29.975]  Should have been in a level four government bio-shield weapon lab.
[00:15:29.975 --> 00:15:31.216]  That's, by the way, federal law.
[00:15:31.216 --> 00:15:32.657]  They just ignore it as part of
[00:15:34.107 --> 00:15:35.808]  Destroying the law.
[00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:41.190]  Duncan carried the deadly virus with him from Liberia, though he showed no signs when he left for the United States.
[00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.530]  That's been proven to be bull.
[00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.711]  Love the whitewash here.
[00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:47.592]  He arrived in Dallas September 20th and fell sick a few days later.
[00:15:47.592 --> 00:15:48.973]  Yeah.
[00:15:48.973 --> 00:15:53.295]  His condition was downgraded during the weekend from serious to critical.
[00:15:53.295 --> 00:16:00.397]  Others in Dallas are still being monitored as health officials try to contain the virus that has ravaged West Africa with more than 3,400 people reported dead.
[00:16:02.398 --> 00:16:11.928]  They're also are trying to tap down anxiety among residents frightened of contracting Ebola.
[00:16:11.928 --> 00:16:15.172]  Though the disease can be spread only through direct contact with the body fluids.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.442]  of an already sick person.
[00:16:18.442 --> 00:16:19.924]  Well, that's not guaranteed to be true.
[00:16:19.924 --> 00:16:26.271]  Health officials have identified 10 people, including 7 health workers, who had direct contact with Duncan while he was contagious.
[00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:29.795]  Another 38 people have also had to come in contact with him.
[00:16:29.795 --> 00:16:36.422]  The family is quarantined after days, but another 30-plus people are just being monitored.
[00:16:36.422 --> 00:16:37.544]  Now, they should be locked up.
[00:16:39.987 --> 00:16:49.569]  Remember, I'm Mr. Anti-Lock-People-Up, but the only time you can lock people up is when they've been around somebody with something that kills 90-plus percent of people that come in contact with it.
[00:16:49.569 --> 00:16:54.871]  You get it, 90-plus percent of the time, you're dead.
[00:16:54.871 --> 00:17:00.612]  Even with all the modern stuff, they're saying it's 60-70 percent, upgraded from 50-something percent they were saying would die.
[00:17:00.612 --> 00:17:07.554]  I mean, this guy died, and it's a horrible death with blood spewing out of every orifice.
[00:17:07.554 --> 00:17:08.674]  I'm not going to go into details.
[00:17:08.674 --> 00:17:09.234]  You know about it.
[00:17:10.751 --> 00:17:13.493]  But it's not pretty.
[00:17:13.493 --> 00:17:20.119]  And I'm right down the road from this, with all these Dallasites and people just pouring into Austin for the big rock concerts.
[00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.541]  They've had two weeks in a row.
[00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.503]  Last weekend, this weekend, ACL.
[00:17:24.503 --> 00:17:25.404]  Hip-hop, all of it.
[00:17:25.404 --> 00:17:27.466]  Huge music festival.
[00:17:27.466 --> 00:17:30.869]  And all these international flights coming in, and it's just ridiculous.
[00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:35.793]  They say, keep your kids home if they're sick with the cold, but then they sent this guy's kids to school at first.
[00:17:35.793 --> 00:17:36.714]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:41.416]  And then said parents were wrong, we're pulling their kids out of the school.
[00:17:41.416 --> 00:17:44.397]  Well, let me tell you.
[00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:57.202]  The way kids spread stuff in the school system, if I lived in Dallas and had my kids in public school, and there was one case with somebody's kids going to school, I would take them out of school, period, in the whole school system.
[00:17:57.202 --> 00:18:02.024]  They shut down whole cities in Liberia and Sierra Leone and other areas trying to stop the spread of it.
[00:18:02.024 --> 00:18:04.324]  Here they go, oh, just fly in.
[00:18:04.324 --> 00:18:05.545]  Oh, just come across the border.
[00:18:07.892 --> 00:18:10.115]  By the way, you know what else is in the news?
[00:18:10.115 --> 00:18:10.355]  U.S.
[00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:15.441]  Representative Duncan Hunter said 10 ISIS fighters caught by U.S.
[00:18:15.441 --> 00:18:16.462]  Border Patrol.
[00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:19.686]  That's coming up.
[00:18:19.686 --> 00:18:21.288]  By the way, that means Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:22.149]  And here's Bloomberg.
[00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:24.913]  Kurdish protesters, Royal Turkey.
[00:18:24.913 --> 00:18:27.456]  Yeah, they're burning stuff down as jihadists fight
[00:18:30.501 --> 00:18:32.323]  And the Kurds are in the news.
[00:18:32.323 --> 00:18:34.765]  Kurds blame Turkey for not stopping ISIS.
[00:18:34.765 --> 00:18:39.449]  They go on to say that they're really Al-Qaeda and that Turkey is funding the group that has been slaughtering them.
[00:18:39.449 --> 00:18:41.151]  See, the Kurds live over there.
[00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:46.275]  They're being murdered by Al-Qaeda, calling itself ISIS, ISIS-ISIL, to confuse people.
[00:18:46.275 --> 00:18:53.602]  And so their response is, riot inside Turkey and burn stuff down.
[00:18:53.602 --> 00:18:54.823]  And the jihadis are battling them.
[00:18:56.121 --> 00:18:58.182]  I mean, the Kurds haven't attacked anybody in hundreds of years.
[00:18:58.182 --> 00:18:59.003]  They want to be left alone.
[00:18:59.003 --> 00:19:05.606]  They're a minority group of Muslims, and they know what's going on.
[00:19:05.606 --> 00:19:10.389]  They don't know who Britney Spears is, I'll bet you money, but they do know who ISIS is.
[00:19:10.389 --> 00:19:11.370]  Just like the Pentagon does.
[00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.291]  Just like the Pentagon's gone to Obama and said, stop it.
[00:19:14.291 --> 00:19:18.754]  And the British Ministry of Defense has gone to Cameron and said, stop it.
[00:19:18.754 --> 00:19:21.916]  And I'm not even lionizing the military, but when they do the right thing, they do the right thing.
[00:19:23.035 --> 00:19:35.363]  Our whole political system, Congressman Jones was on last week, or I guess Monday, and they all know the Saudis are behind 9-11 and our government stood down, and they're saying release it.
[00:19:35.363 --> 00:19:38.646]  You see, this stuff's all real.
[00:19:38.646 --> 00:19:49.033]  And now, Obama has let Al-Qaeda into the country, and when they attack us, Obama will take more of our liberties and grandstand, and no one will point out that they let them in.
[00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:54.834]  Oraldo Rivera will call us racist for saying the border shouldn't be wide open.
[00:19:54.834 --> 00:19:56.415]  And that Ebola could come into the U.S.
[00:19:56.415 --> 00:19:58.015]  Of course it did come in.
[00:19:58.015 --> 00:19:59.076]  Someone's died now.
[00:19:59.076 --> 00:20:03.639]  You've forgotten to monitor blockitpocket.com, haven't you?
[00:20:03.639 --> 00:20:05.840]  Oh, how quickly we forget.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.862]  Blockit Pocket wants you to know that they never forget.

[00:20:11.203 --> 00:20:12.104]  We're good to go.
[00:20:28.732 --> 00:20:29.853]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:34.336]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:34.336 --> 00:20:40.061]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:40.061 --> 00:20:43.624]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:43.624 --> 00:20:46.306]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:22:29.823 --> 00:22:32.725]  It takes less than 10 seconds to kick in a door.
[00:22:32.725 --> 00:22:35.488]  10 seconds is not enough time to protect your family.
[00:22:35.488 --> 00:22:37.449]  And what would happen if you're not home?

[00:22:56.483 --> 00:22:59.646]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[00:22:59.646 --> 00:23:03.831]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[00:23:03.831 --> 00:23:05.112]  What are you doing to prepare?
[00:23:05.112 --> 00:23:08.996]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[00:23:08.996 --> 00:23:10.558]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:11.999]  The total amount of debt in the U.S.
[00:23:11.999 --> 00:23:15.363]  has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[00:23:15.363 --> 00:23:18.446]  The too-big-to-fail banks are much larger,
[00:23:18.866 --> 00:23:27.934]  And the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming.
[00:23:27.934 --> 00:23:36.301]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street casino and start a cash-flowing international business of your own.
[00:23:36.301 --> 00:23:42.747]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can grow your wealth like having your own business.
[00:23:42.747 --> 00:23:43.688]  The crash is coming.
[00:23:43.968 --> 00:23:46.551]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:49.354]  Go to BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[00:23:49.354 --> 00:23:50.655]  That's BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[00:24:13.392 --> 00:24:25.579]  Let's go to the Ebola news, then I'll get into the economic news and a lot more in the next segment and open the phones up.
[00:24:28.058 --> 00:24:30.039]  Again, if you just joined us, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:31.739]  InfoWars.com is the main site.
[00:24:31.739 --> 00:24:33.680]  PrisonPlanet.com is the backup.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.881]  It has a lot of original news on it as well.
[00:24:35.881 --> 00:24:40.603]  The subscription InfoWars Nightly News site is PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:40.603 --> 00:24:44.384]  First Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S.
[00:24:44.384 --> 00:24:44.984]  has died.
[00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:48.426]  Thomas Eric Duncan died at 7.51 a.m.
[00:24:48.426 --> 00:24:52.567]  from the virus Ebola.
[00:24:52.567 --> 00:24:53.768]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:24:53.768 --> 00:24:56.669]  Spain struggles to address concern over Ebola case.
[00:24:57.586 --> 00:25:02.951]  Just do what our media does and just say it's not bad for you and it's no big deal.
[00:25:02.951 --> 00:25:04.192]  Do what the CDC does.
[00:25:04.192 --> 00:25:13.160]  Just come out and say that there is absolutely no problem.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.003]  Meanwhile, she got it from an Ebola patient they brought into the country.
[00:25:17.003 --> 00:25:19.005]  Again, bring people into the country
[00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.211]  And don't put them in a level 4 bioweapons lab.
[00:25:22.211 --> 00:25:23.452]  You are a total criminal.
[00:25:23.452 --> 00:25:24.772]  Bring them in, you're a criminal.
[00:25:24.772 --> 00:25:30.515]  You bring them in and don't put them in a top facility by themselves or with other Ebola patients, you are now culpable.
[00:25:30.515 --> 00:25:32.636]  Big time.
[00:25:32.636 --> 00:25:40.840]  And I told everybody, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I've had virologists on, the default protocol is don't bring them in the country, keep them on ships.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.941]  Or in country where they have it.
[00:25:42.697 --> 00:25:51.244]  The default is don't send 3,000 and then 2,000 more, 5,000 US troops into three different African countries that are collapsing.
[00:25:51.244 --> 00:25:53.747]  Just default, don't do that.
[00:25:53.747 --> 00:26:05.677]  Default, don't not scrub the ambulance and the house day one, and default quarantine the whole family and everybody they came in contact with, and quarantine everybody who flew in on the plane with them.
[00:26:05.677 --> 00:26:08.339]  Didn't happen.
[00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:09.140]  None of it happened!
[00:26:11.147 --> 00:26:18.629]  Because the feds, folks, when TB is drug-resistant and they catch somebody flying, they have a database, they arrest them at the airport almost every time.
[00:26:18.629 --> 00:26:19.469]  They have a database.
[00:26:19.469 --> 00:26:21.670]  They actually do a pretty good job.
[00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:22.870]  Let me explain that to you.
[00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:35.434]  They want this spreading, period, like I said a month and a half ago, like I said a month ago, a week ago, and Monday.
[00:26:35.434 --> 00:26:37.935]  Think about it.
[00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:38.415]  Think about it.
[00:26:39.355 --> 00:26:40.515]  Let it sink in.
[00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:45.857]  I know you know, I know I know, but that's how evil the people are that have hijacked our government.
[00:26:45.857 --> 00:26:46.798]  And hijacked is key.
[00:26:46.798 --> 00:26:49.139]  This is not our government.
[00:26:49.139 --> 00:26:58.022]  If somebody hijacks a plane and puts on the pilot outfit, which a lot of hijackers do because people start following their orders when they put on the captain's outfit, that's not the captain, folks!
[00:27:00.609 --> 00:27:04.470]  You don't open the borders up and say, everything's free, come to America.
[00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.951]  If you're the president, you're an enemy of the republic.
[00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:08.872]  Period.
[00:27:08.872 --> 00:27:10.272]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:27:10.272 --> 00:27:15.194]  Those words don't even begin to get near the severity.
[00:27:15.194 --> 00:27:17.174]  I don't have words.
[00:27:17.174 --> 00:27:28.878]  Shakespeare wouldn't have words to describe the spirit of destruction, the spirit of anti-freedom, the will to wreck this country, and only let select interest operate in it.
[00:27:30.552 --> 00:27:33.054]  So, Spain struggles to address concern over Ebola case.
[00:27:33.054 --> 00:27:34.395]  Oh, really?
[00:27:34.395 --> 00:27:38.378]  European Union asked Spain for more information on how health worker contracted disease.
[00:27:38.378 --> 00:27:44.503]  Well, they brought in other health workers out of West Africa that had it, and that's how she got it.
[00:27:44.503 --> 00:27:47.746]  And they're now saying she touched her face.
[00:27:47.746 --> 00:27:48.306]  Document.
[00:27:48.306 --> 00:27:53.750]  Spanish woman touched face with Ebola glove.
[00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:54.951]  Let me give you the news flash.
[00:27:54.951 --> 00:27:55.912]  It's mutated over 300 times.
[00:27:57.483 --> 00:27:58.784]  It used to mutate a couple times a year.
[00:27:58.784 --> 00:28:00.927]  Now it's mutating 300 times in the last year.
[00:28:00.927 --> 00:28:02.428]  That's CDC's own numbers.
[00:28:02.428 --> 00:28:07.054]  And it's clearly incubates from not three days, but 21 at least.
[00:28:07.054 --> 00:28:08.936]  And it's clearly spreading faster.
[00:28:08.936 --> 00:28:18.767]  And most virologists, we said this two months ago, almost two months ago, in the New York Times three weeks ago, that they believe it is somewhat, I'm going to say it again, weak but airborne.
[00:28:19.887 --> 00:28:21.008]  Weak, but airborne.
[00:28:21.008 --> 00:28:27.413]  And they had the discoverer of Ebola come out yesterday and say they believe it's going to go airborne.
[00:28:27.413 --> 00:28:31.637]  Now let me tell you what's going to happen if it goes airborne.
[00:28:31.637 --> 00:28:37.161]  If they leave the border open or they let it spread, they're 100% responsible.
[00:28:37.161 --> 00:28:39.803]  And I want everybody to know, remember who did it.
[00:28:39.803 --> 00:28:41.124]  And let me tell you, what are they planning?
[00:28:41.124 --> 00:28:42.806]  I think they can get away with this.
[00:28:42.806 --> 00:28:49.211]  What are the people running Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control and the National Security Council
[00:28:50.486 --> 00:28:53.028]  That's what really runs the country, the COG.
[00:28:53.028 --> 00:28:56.030]  That's over NORTHCOM, the Continuity Government Board.
[00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.211]  What are they doing?
[00:28:57.211 --> 00:28:58.872]  They're doing this in front of everyone.
[00:28:58.872 --> 00:29:00.774]  They're funding Al-Qaeda in front of everyone.
[00:29:00.774 --> 00:29:02.535]  They're opening the borders in front of everyone.
[00:29:02.535 --> 00:29:04.597]  They're turning the power plants off in front of everyone.
[00:29:04.597 --> 00:29:07.219]  They're doing policies that will destroy the dollar in front of everyone.
[00:29:07.219 --> 00:29:12.183]  They're starting wars with Russia for no reason in front of everyone.
[00:29:12.183 --> 00:29:13.464]  What is going on?
[00:29:13.464 --> 00:29:14.785]  What is going on?
[00:29:14.785 --> 00:29:15.565]  What is going on?
[00:29:15.565 --> 00:29:17.527]  These people are out of control!
[00:29:19.611 --> 00:29:22.859]  So, they've shipped more than 25 people into the U.S.
[00:29:22.859 --> 00:29:25.406]  that have Ebola, and they've shipped a couple into Spain.
[00:29:25.406 --> 00:29:26.127]  It's already spread there.
[00:29:26.997 --> 00:29:29.319]  Connecticut Health Commissioner granted quarantine power.
[00:29:29.319 --> 00:29:29.959]  AP.
[00:29:29.959 --> 00:29:32.361]  Yeah, see, they're going to use this to lock whoever they want.
[00:29:32.361 --> 00:29:34.902]  Once it spreads, let the crisis get out of control.
[00:29:34.902 --> 00:29:36.063]  Coast Guard.
[00:29:36.063 --> 00:29:38.104]  Sector issues new steps on Ebola virus.
[00:29:38.104 --> 00:29:38.745]  AP.
[00:29:38.745 --> 00:29:40.646]  I guarantee you they did that because it's default.
[00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:42.567]  Obama will probably order a stand down.
[00:29:42.567 --> 00:29:43.208]  I predict that.
[00:29:43.208 --> 00:29:44.869]  A quiet stand down.
[00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:45.489]  CDC.
[00:29:45.489 --> 00:29:46.210]  Airborne Ebola.
[00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.711]  Possible, but unlikely.
[00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:48.371]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:49.772]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.772 --> 00:29:52.294]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.294 --> 00:29:54.956]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.858 --> 00:30:01.380]  Open your eyes.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.804]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[00:30:04.804 --> 00:30:11.291]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:19.240]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.021]  Open your eyes!
[00:30:21.021 --> 00:30:36.630]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is a new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.

[00:30:50.378 --> 00:30:50.818]  Occupower.
[00:30:50.818 --> 00:30:51.598]  Open your eyes.
[00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:09.090]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:18.796]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:31:18.996 --> 00:31:29.383]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[00:31:29.383 --> 00:31:34.046]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[00:31:34.046 --> 00:31:36.288]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[00:31:36.488 --> 00:31:39.029]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:44.713]  Instead, Oxy-Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[00:31:44.713 --> 00:31:50.056]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[00:31:50.056 --> 00:31:55.539]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with Oxy-Powder.

[00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:01.720]  In the near future.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.202]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:32:06.202 --> 00:32:07.422]  Security alert.
[00:32:07.422 --> 00:32:09.423]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:32:09.423 --> 00:32:10.283]  Analysis.
[00:32:10.283 --> 00:32:13.125]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[00:32:13.125 --> 00:32:18.007]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:32:18.007 --> 00:32:19.047]  Crime Directive.
[00:32:19.047 --> 00:32:20.588]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:32:20.588 --> 00:32:23.449]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:32:23.449 --> 00:32:26.691]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:32:26.691 --> 00:32:28.992]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:32:28.992 --> 00:32:29.712]  These people are a
[00:32:30.192 --> 00:32:33.335]  They're never going to stop.
[00:32:33.335 --> 00:32:38.979]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:32:38.979 --> 00:32:47.566]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:32:47.566 --> 00:32:50.549]  Collectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:22.728]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.728 --> 00:33:27.833]  Well, the rats were leaving the sinking ship very, very quickly now.
[00:33:27.833 --> 00:33:31.116]  Basically, none of the Democrats want Obama at their functions.
[00:33:31.116 --> 00:33:32.478]  Bumper stickers are showing up.
[00:33:33.826 --> 00:33:46.072]  All over California and other areas saying Ebola with the Obama symbol in the middle of the O. You can see it at DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com also has an article about it.
[00:33:46.072 --> 00:33:48.853]  And I tell you, great minds think alike.
[00:33:48.853 --> 00:33:55.456]  I began first about a week and a half ago, I'm sure other people did this as well because it's obvious, calling it Obola.
[00:33:56.843 --> 00:34:08.355]  And so I already had the crew, well I mentioned it to them last week, never got around to it, making a t-shirt that said Ebola on the back and Ebola on the front with a symbol.
[00:34:08.355 --> 00:34:10.737]  So the shirts are being made right now.
[00:34:10.737 --> 00:34:15.001]  We're going to go ahead and post it on the shopping cart, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:34:17.103 --> 00:34:19.886]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:34:19.886 --> 00:34:27.432]  We're going to go ahead and post that because it's good to associate Obama and socialism and collectivism and anti-guns with disease.
[00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:30.675]  Because tyranny is the most dangerous disease this world's ever seen.
[00:34:30.675 --> 00:34:40.844]  Killed 262 million non-combatants, according to the University of Hawaii, under democide, death by government, in the 20th century alone.
[00:34:44.252 --> 00:34:48.515]  And so we are coming out with a limited edition.
[00:34:48.515 --> 00:34:58.600]  I have told them to make only 3,000 of these in different sizes, from small up to XXL.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.921]  3,000 are being made right now.
[00:34:59.921 --> 00:35:01.182]  They'll be here in a few weeks.
[00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:04.124]  So go ahead and pre-order, and you'll get it.
[00:35:04.124 --> 00:35:05.925]  I don't know, it comes in in two, three weeks.
[00:35:05.925 --> 00:35:06.985]  It'll take you a week to ship it.
[00:35:06.985 --> 00:35:07.646]  You'll get it in a month.
[00:35:08.126 --> 00:35:09.007]  You'll be the first to have it.
[00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:11.130]  I haven't seen anybody else that has this yet.
[00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:14.734]  And it helps fund the operation and denigrate their god.
[00:35:14.734 --> 00:35:19.320]  Because Obama had to be politically destroyed quicker than they wanted him to.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.524]  They always want their political gods destroyed to bring you the new god.
[00:35:23.857 --> 00:35:29.359]  But they intended this guy to really be messianic and to never be fully discredited.
[00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:32.660]  He fell a lot faster than they intended.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.961]  And that's good because it discredits their whole system.
[00:35:34.961 --> 00:35:40.023]  And going into the next election cycle, we need to fully destroy Barack Obama.
[00:35:40.023 --> 00:35:41.984]  Because we know he's a puppet.
[00:35:41.984 --> 00:35:44.404]  But the general public doesn't fully get that.
[00:35:44.404 --> 00:35:48.566]  So you have to absolutely discredit everything associated with him.
[00:35:49.505 --> 00:35:58.532]  His anti-gun, anti-family, you-didn't-build-it, raising-the-debt-limit-doesn't-raise-the-debt, all of his fraud must be destroyed.
[00:35:58.532 --> 00:36:00.454]  We don't want to hurt him physically.
[00:36:00.454 --> 00:36:03.597]  That would save him if somebody tried to kill him or kill him.
[00:36:03.597 --> 00:36:06.079]  That's something the globalists might do in my gut.
[00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:09.281]  That's in the cards, definitely, or at least in a fake assassination attempt.
[00:36:09.281 --> 00:36:11.803]  We want to destroy his image.
[00:36:11.803 --> 00:36:14.566]  Because he's not real to begin with, a narcissist husk.
[00:36:17.028 --> 00:36:18.369]  So that's very important.
[00:36:18.369 --> 00:36:20.410]  If it's not up there right now, we have the next hour.
[00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:26.453]  Infowarsstore.com or just tell us what size you want or how many when you call.
[00:36:26.453 --> 00:36:30.415]  Oh, and by the way, to rush this out, this will not be made in America.
[00:36:30.415 --> 00:36:35.497]  We have our non-made-in-America lines from Mexico and Vietnam and you name it.
[00:36:35.497 --> 00:36:36.918]  Most of our shirts are now made in America.
[00:36:36.918 --> 00:36:38.879]  They usually cost a lot more for us.
[00:36:38.879 --> 00:36:43.561]  We sell them at the same price and it takes forever to get because of all the regulations and red tape and bureaucracy.
[00:36:45.342 --> 00:36:49.145]  You know, a t-shirt from Mexico that cost us $3 from the U.S.
[00:36:49.145 --> 00:36:50.726]  cost $12.
[00:36:50.726 --> 00:36:52.287]  Though the stuff made in America is better.
[00:36:52.287 --> 00:36:57.250]  That's the madein1776.com line at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:58.691]  That's a sub-site on there.
[00:36:58.691 --> 00:37:02.174]  All the MoA and LABA shirts, you name it, all the Patriot apparel.
[00:37:02.174 --> 00:37:09.859]  But, this shirt will end up being one of the ones they have in mass already ready.
[00:37:09.859 --> 00:37:12.141]  I don't know where it'll be from, because I think it's being made right now.
[00:37:12.141 --> 00:37:13.402]  I just said make it as fast as you can.
[00:37:14.305 --> 00:37:17.047]  She got the Made in America stuff and you got the stuff that isn't made in America.
[00:37:17.047 --> 00:37:19.489]  Though we don't really put a lot of shirts out now that aren't made in America.
[00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:21.931]  But they're not part of the made in 1776 line.
[00:37:21.931 --> 00:37:29.557]  So, the shirt is going to be $14.95 to make it affordable in all sizes but XXL will be $19.95 in that.
[00:37:29.557 --> 00:37:31.058]  And so if you want to order it, get ready.
[00:37:31.058 --> 00:37:32.039]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:37.046]  Now again, ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you about Survival Shield X2.
[00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:38.447]  We'll get back into the news.
[00:37:38.447 --> 00:37:40.790]  They don't tell you about iodine.
[00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.874]  With all the madness going on, notice they're not telling you about iodine.
[00:37:43.874 --> 00:37:45.376]  They don't tell you about the research.
[00:37:47.287 --> 00:37:48.929]  Or how to actually prepare.
[00:37:48.929 --> 00:37:54.895]  They don't talk about the key studies on natural plant compounds and how they work to defend the body.
[00:37:54.895 --> 00:37:56.937]  I mean, all this insanity.
[00:37:56.937 --> 00:38:04.606]  Notice people are just waiting on Bill Gates to create some new magic vaccine that will be tested on African babies and you know what'll happen.
[00:38:05.691 --> 00:38:05.811]  It's
[00:38:23.081 --> 00:38:31.484]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:38:31.484 --> 00:38:43.248]  Also, what else I'm doing for my immune system is DNA Force, that's back in stock for a limited time, contains a whole bunch of patented ingredients based on Nobel Prize science and backed by clinical research.
[00:38:43.248 --> 00:38:46.689]  We have that stuff linked at Infowarslife.com and the videos as well.
[00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:53.833]  Just one such patented ingredient has more potent antioxidant activity than vitamin C. That's kind of a joke statement.
[00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:59.457]  It's something like several thousand cartons of blueberries in every serving equivalent.
[00:38:59.457 --> 00:39:01.158]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:39:01.158 --> 00:39:06.802]  Help energize your cellular powerhouse, mitochondrial function, and sustain healthy cell cycles.
[00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:13.266]  DNA Force is the most amazing product yet from InfoWarsLife.com and the InfoWarsLife formula line.
[00:39:14.434 --> 00:39:26.582]  So whether it's DNA force or oxy powder that flushes out the gut, 70 plus percent of your immune system is in the gut, just all of it is available at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139 and your purchase makes the entire...
[00:39:31.505 --> 00:39:34.206]  Transmission everything we do here possible.
[00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:54.550]  And this is what I'm personally doing for my health and my family is drinking more purified water, eating more healthy non-GMO food, getting sun, having fun, laughing and joking with my children, getting more exercise, taking survival shield, taking silver bullet, colloidal silver, taking DNA force.
[00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.390]  And it's just been there.
[00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.190]  I mean, everybody that sees me, I still don't look like I look when I was 25.
[00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.391]  But I mean, I don't know, a few more months, we're getting there.
[00:40:00.891 --> 00:40:01.732]  We're getting there, folks.
[00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:04.274]  I mean, I can't wait to take photos before and after with my shirt off.
[00:40:04.274 --> 00:40:08.897]  I mean, my belly is one-tenth of what it was five years ago.
[00:40:08.897 --> 00:40:10.919]  One-tenth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:10.919 --> 00:40:13.801]  I mean, sitting down, there's barely any little pot belly there now.
[00:40:13.801 --> 00:40:16.143]  It is 90% gone.
[00:40:16.143 --> 00:40:22.948]  And it's taken a while, and it's taken the real things that my body was deficient in.
[00:40:22.948 --> 00:40:27.592]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine really helped, from InfoWarsHealth.com, and the great Young Cavity lines as well.
[00:40:28.502 --> 00:40:32.913]  Okay, I'm done plugging, but that's how we fund the operation, and I really believe in these products as well.
[00:40:32.913 --> 00:40:35.619]  Let me recap the Ebola news, have it gone through the full stack, then we'll...
[00:40:38.854 --> 00:40:41.955]  Give the number out and take your calls ahead of Michael Savage.
[00:40:41.955 --> 00:40:45.396]  Are you upset or am I wrong about Ebola?
[00:40:45.396 --> 00:40:46.756]  I mean, we said it was going to come here.
[00:40:46.756 --> 00:40:49.017]  We said that people would get infected by medical workers.
[00:40:49.017 --> 00:40:51.497]  It's now happening in Spain, confirmed.
[00:40:51.497 --> 00:40:54.678]  We're saying that, you know, this guy would probably die.
[00:40:54.678 --> 00:40:56.999]  We're saying the government's doing everything it can to let it spread.
[00:40:56.999 --> 00:40:58.079]  Do you disagree with that?
[00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.340]  We don't screen your calls.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.880]  I'd love to be convinced I'm wrong.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.761]  This isn't completely deliberate.
[00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:04.501]  I got three children.
[00:41:05.987 --> 00:41:09.710]  I've had three family members die of these mystery illnesses this year alone.
[00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:15.355]  I've had a family member in serious medical condition for two weeks.
[00:41:15.355 --> 00:41:16.876]  I'm getting sick of it.
[00:41:16.876 --> 00:41:23.622]  And I've told you this whole year, I sense this winter is going to be, I'm on record, a hellish time for disease.
[00:41:23.622 --> 00:41:24.823]  I've never talked like that.
[00:41:24.823 --> 00:41:26.324]  And then look, Ebola popped up.
[00:41:26.324 --> 00:41:28.807]  I just, my gut is never wrong, people.
[00:41:28.807 --> 00:41:30.368]  It's never wrong.
[00:41:30.368 --> 00:41:32.169]  All hell is about to break loose.
[00:41:32.169 --> 00:41:33.290]  I have been telling you this
[00:41:34.244 --> 00:41:47.672]  For the last few years and the last six months or so before this even popped up, open borders, collapsing, shutting down the power plants, raising all these taxes, starting war with Russia, Ebola, turning Al-Qaeda loose.
[00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:48.493]  I mean, look at this.
[00:41:48.493 --> 00:41:51.935]  Every day I see, literally every day I see stuff like this.
[00:41:51.935 --> 00:41:57.138]  Washington Times, producer of anti-Obamacare movie, sick and sicker, hit with IRS audit.
[00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.231]  And that's meant to just intimidate everybody.
[00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:05.595]  Folks, you should be scared of not getting involved and them winning.
[00:42:05.595 --> 00:42:07.296]  They're going to go after everybody.
[00:42:07.296 --> 00:42:11.480]  This is pure tyranny.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.101]  You tell people there's death panels in the bill?
[00:42:13.101 --> 00:42:14.702]  Show them the subsection.
[00:42:14.702 --> 00:42:19.685]  You tell them it raises 7 taxes on poor people, 20 plus on everybody?
[00:42:19.685 --> 00:42:25.049]  That it's designed to screw up the economy and shut America down for cloward and pevin?
[00:42:25.049 --> 00:42:25.229]  Senate 21?
[00:42:27.554 --> 00:42:31.377]  The IRS comes and tears your office apart.
[00:42:31.377 --> 00:42:32.758]  We've gotten to enjoy that over the years.
[00:42:32.758 --> 00:42:39.024]  I don't want to make an issue out of it because it doesn't intimidate me, the state, and the feds, and all the whatever people.
[00:42:39.024 --> 00:42:43.788]  It's going to be your kids dying of Ebola 2, or this flesh-eating stuff that gets in the lungs.
[00:42:43.788 --> 00:42:44.989]  Don't you idiots get it?
[00:42:44.989 --> 00:42:48.152]  You're not going to be cut in on the winning team, you morons!
[00:42:48.152 --> 00:42:49.713]  What the hell's your problem?
[00:42:49.713 --> 00:42:50.173]  Excuse me.
[00:42:51.385 --> 00:42:53.126]  You people are morons!
[00:42:53.126 --> 00:42:55.227]  There is no honor among thieves.
[00:42:55.227 --> 00:42:57.948]  You don't get out of it going along with this.
[00:42:57.948 --> 00:42:59.569]  You gotta stand up against it.
[00:42:59.569 --> 00:43:01.010]  It's the only shot we've got.
[00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:06.132]  And if you're intimidated by this stuff, they win.
[00:43:06.132 --> 00:43:09.514]  If you're intimidated by these people, we're gonna lose everything.
[00:43:09.514 --> 00:43:12.395]  Don't folks understand that?
[00:43:12.395 --> 00:43:14.616]  The government has our border wide open.
[00:43:14.616 --> 00:43:17.378]  In fact, before I get back into Ebola, look at this headline.
[00:43:18.086 --> 00:43:18.926]  The weekly standard.
[00:43:18.926 --> 00:43:23.228]  General, if Ebola reaches Central America, there will be mass migration to the U.S.
[00:43:23.228 --> 00:43:24.489]  No kidding.
[00:43:24.489 --> 00:43:27.730]  We have no border, and we've advertised to the world there's no border.
[00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:35.234]  And what happens if Ebola gets down into Central and South America, where it's going to breed like wildfire with all their bat species down there that are known to spread it?
[00:43:35.234 --> 00:43:38.495]  Let me give you a news flash.
[00:43:38.495 --> 00:43:40.756]  Bats don't die from it, on average.
[00:43:40.756 --> 00:43:41.437]  They carry it.
[00:43:41.437 --> 00:43:43.237]  They now know it's not monkeys, it's bats in Africa.
[00:43:43.237 --> 00:43:44.418]  That's been confirmed for a decade.
[00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:50.014]  You go down the hike and bike trail in the evening when the bats come out in Austin, Texas and they fly around.
[00:43:50.014 --> 00:43:52.536]  You feel little things wet, smells like pee hitting you.
[00:43:52.536 --> 00:43:54.797]  That's their crap.
[00:43:54.797 --> 00:43:56.999]  I won't go on the hike and bike trail when the bats come out at night.
[00:43:56.999 --> 00:43:57.920]  Not that I'm against bats.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.801]  I don't like being crapped on by them.
[00:43:59.801 --> 00:44:00.862]  And they carry rabies.
[00:44:00.862 --> 00:44:02.643]  And I'm not a germaphobe, folks.
[00:44:02.643 --> 00:44:08.187]  I'm starting to become one, though, with all these people I know sick and dying.
[00:44:08.187 --> 00:44:13.350]  Now, what happens when the bats get Ebola here?
[00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.292]  With our impaired immune systems and the rest of it?
[00:44:16.547 --> 00:44:22.129]  You walk under a bridge, you smell that smell, you hear bats chirping during the day, asleep up there?
[00:44:22.129 --> 00:44:26.070]  Imagine if that gets into them.
[00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.250]  There's the New York Times.
[00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.751]  Linked to African Ebola found in bats suggests virus is more widespread.
[00:44:30.751 --> 00:44:33.072]  It's in the bats now.
[00:44:33.072 --> 00:44:36.152]  That's why it's spreading all over Africa.
[00:44:36.152 --> 00:44:45.255]  They fly over at night, fruit bats are out during the day as well, part of the day, and they pee and go to the bathroom over you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:46.912 --> 00:44:48.654]  And then you breathe it.
[00:44:48.654 --> 00:44:49.814]  Do you understand?
[00:44:49.814 --> 00:44:53.197]  It's not technically airborne, but it is.
[00:44:53.197 --> 00:44:59.042]  Roaches can carry it on their feet.
[00:44:59.042 --> 00:45:00.523]  I'm not trying to scare people.
[00:45:00.523 --> 00:45:02.085]  I want us to get prepared.
[00:45:02.085 --> 00:45:03.546]  I'm concerned.
[00:45:03.546 --> 00:45:04.146]  Meanwhile...
[00:45:05.299 --> 00:45:05.639]  U.S.
[00:45:05.639 --> 00:45:09.443]  Representative Duncan Hunter, we're going to play this clip, says 10 ISIS fighters caught by U.S.
[00:45:09.443 --> 00:45:10.244]  Border Patrol.
[00:45:10.244 --> 00:45:25.920]  Yeah, we've met with ISIS and Border Patrol, and they say they pick up jihadis with the prayer cloths, with Inspire, Al Qaeda magazine, the whole nine yards, and they're told, oh, that's just a sympathizer or a nut, give them to us, and then they just basically release them or they don't know where they go.
[00:45:27.941 --> 00:45:35.347]  So see, the government is trying, at criminal levels, to let these people in so they can go shoot up a school, blow something up.
[00:45:35.347 --> 00:45:36.187]  And here's the deal.
[00:45:36.187 --> 00:45:41.551]  When Al-Qaeda, under the name ISIS or ISIL, goes and shoots up a school, I'm not turning my guns in.
[00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:42.992]  You understand, feds?
[00:45:42.992 --> 00:45:45.334]  And then you're going to try to march the police off.
[00:45:45.334 --> 00:45:45.674]  I know.
[00:45:45.674 --> 00:45:46.775]  And the civil war starts.
[00:45:46.775 --> 00:45:47.736]  That's the whole plan.
[00:45:47.736 --> 00:45:49.857]  I get it.
[00:45:49.857 --> 00:45:53.120]  And if the American people are dumb enough to go along with this, I guess we deserve it.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.242]  I guess we did murder 54-plus million babies since 1974.
[00:46:01.363 --> 00:46:06.549]  My dad was going to medical school, my mom got pregnant.
[00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:08.451]  And Roe v. Wade had just passed, 1973.
[00:46:08.451 --> 00:46:13.437]  And abortion was the new hot trendy thing to do.
[00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.340]  And my mom was working at the Dallas Morning News.
[00:46:18.686 --> 00:46:27.231]  And people told her, oh, your career, oh, you're doing modeling, oh, just go get an abortion, wait till your husband.
[00:46:27.231 --> 00:46:31.913]  No, my dad just worked two, three jobs, and my mom worked a job part-time while she was pregnant.
[00:46:31.913 --> 00:46:34.275]  And I'm here, I'm not dead.
[00:46:34.275 --> 00:46:35.596]  But you know what?
[00:46:35.596 --> 00:46:43.100]  There were discussions about chopping me up.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.841]  So maybe America just has to be judged.
[00:46:44.841 --> 00:46:46.842]  Maybe that's what this all comes down to.
[00:46:48.976 --> 00:46:50.337]  And it's the madness of the elite.
[00:46:50.337 --> 00:46:51.377]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:46:51.377 --> 00:46:54.458]  800-259-9231 on Ebola, or on these Al-Qaeda fighters crossing the border.
[00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:57.619]  What happens when they shoot up a school, or shoot up a mall?
[00:47:04.264 --> 00:47:06.145]  Stop going through metal detectors to go to the mall.
[00:47:06.145 --> 00:47:07.106]  I'm sick of this!
[00:47:07.106 --> 00:47:11.389]  You're supposed to control the border, not random highway checkpoints and malls.
[00:47:11.389 --> 00:47:12.250]  And everybody knows that.
[00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:21.176]  It's like leaving the castle gate open and then having the guards guard some woman in her bed while the front gates open and 50,000 barbarians run through with battle axes.
[00:47:21.176 --> 00:47:28.462]  And the guards are busy down at the Miller's poking him with a sword while he runs a Miller machine, grinding grain.
[00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:33.278]  I'm pulled over and asked where I'm going, what I'm doing.
[00:47:33.278 --> 00:47:35.601]  Caught in those full well, I have no criminal record.
[00:47:35.601 --> 00:47:38.564]  Just going through their thing, you know, milking the milk cow.
[00:47:38.564 --> 00:47:40.607]  Meanwhile, the whole country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:43.090]  It's all a giant fraud.
[00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.552]  Let's go to this clip about 10 Al-Qaeda fighters.
[00:47:45.552 --> 00:47:46.512]  They're calling them ISIS.
[00:47:46.512 --> 00:47:47.873]  No, Al-Qaeda!
[00:47:47.873 --> 00:47:48.813]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:47:48.813 --> 00:47:49.393]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:47:49.393 --> 00:47:50.094]  Here it is.
[00:47:50.094 --> 00:47:54.596]  If you're talking about protecting Americans, ISIS is coming across the southern border.
[00:47:54.596 --> 00:48:01.419]  They aren't flying B-1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.
[00:48:01.539 --> 00:48:02.359]  Let me get a question.
[00:48:02.359 --> 00:48:03.840]  Let me ask a question.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.861]  You say that they're coming in the southern border, which changes all the dynamics.
[00:48:07.861 --> 00:48:13.442]  Do you have any information or any evidence that they're actually coming in the southern border now?
[00:48:13.442 --> 00:48:14.102]  Yes.
[00:48:14.102 --> 00:48:17.083]  Tell me what you know.
[00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:22.845]  I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.
[00:48:22.845 --> 00:48:24.485]  There's nobody talking about it.
[00:48:24.485 --> 00:48:26.586]  How do you know that?
[00:48:26.586 --> 00:48:28.046]  Because I've asked the Border Patrol, Greta.
[00:48:28.783 --> 00:48:33.885]  And the Border Patrol, they just let ISIS members come across the border?
[00:48:33.885 --> 00:48:35.446]  No, they caught them at the border.
[00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:37.946]  Therefore, we know that ISIS is coming across the border.
[00:48:37.946 --> 00:48:43.889]  And if they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's going to be dozens more that are going to be caught by the Border Patrol.
[00:48:43.889 --> 00:48:44.749]  But that's how you know.
[00:48:44.749 --> 00:48:46.930]  All you have to do is ask the Border Patrol.
[00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:52.152]  That's where we're at risk here, is from ISIS and radical Islamists coming across the border.
[00:48:52.152 --> 00:48:52.892]  Because once again,
[00:48:53.252 --> 00:48:56.354]  They don't have a Navy, they don't have an Air Force, they don't have nuclear weapons.
[00:48:56.354 --> 00:49:01.158]  The only way that Americans are going to be harmed by radical Islamists is by having an open southern border.
[00:49:01.158 --> 00:49:03.440]  Chairman Dempsey said the exact same thing.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.522]  He said that's where the major threat is here, is having an open southern border.
[00:49:06.522 --> 00:49:07.343]  That's what Colonel Schaefer says.
[00:49:07.343 --> 00:49:09.364]  That's how these guys are going to infiltrate into the U.S.
[00:49:09.364 --> 00:49:11.025]  He's the expert on it.
[00:49:11.025 --> 00:49:11.806]  Here's the deal, Hunter.
[00:49:11.806 --> 00:49:14.508]  You know the real threat.
[00:49:14.508 --> 00:49:17.990]  It's that the political class wants to take over and get rid of the Bill of Rights.
[00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:21.353]  You guys can do whatever you want and arrest whoever you want.
[00:49:22.847 --> 00:49:35.217]  And the political class in both parties, and not just here but other governments, the entire NATO alliance, has been propping up Al-Qaeda and renaming it, Khorasan and all the rest of it, to menace the West so you guys can take our freedoms.
[00:49:35.217 --> 00:49:37.499]  Now, again, that doesn't mean they completely run them.
[00:49:37.499 --> 00:49:38.580]  They're winding them up.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.641]  They're giving them fuel.
[00:49:40.641 --> 00:49:42.623]  They're dumping the Black Widows in the bed.
[00:49:42.623 --> 00:49:43.764]  You're all accomplices.
[00:49:43.764 --> 00:49:46.746]  I'm not saying Hunter is himself an accomplice.
[00:49:46.746 --> 00:49:48.568]  I'm saying the people at the top,
[00:49:50.276 --> 00:49:53.277]  Our accomplices and our own military knows this is coming out.
[00:49:53.277 --> 00:49:54.738]  Our own military brass.
[00:49:54.738 --> 00:49:57.819]  That's why they've been distancing themselves for about three, four years.
[00:49:57.819 --> 00:49:59.300]  Saying, we don't want to arm these people.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.021]  No, we don't want to give them 15,000 Stinger missiles.
[00:50:02.021 --> 00:50:04.202]  Because here's the newsflash.
[00:50:04.202 --> 00:50:08.264]  FBI, NSA, CIA, Defense Intelligence.
[00:50:08.264 --> 00:50:12.186]  You better let people do their job and roll up all these cells.
[00:50:12.186 --> 00:50:15.968]  Because when they shoot down aircraft, it won't matter what you've done to me.
[00:50:15.968 --> 00:50:18.029]  The word's already out, you gave them the Stinger missiles.
[00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:19.307]  You understand?
[00:50:19.307 --> 00:50:21.069]  We exposed you.
[00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:25.594]  You're not gonna turn these nuts loose and then not get the blame for it.
[00:50:25.594 --> 00:50:28.538]  Do you understand?
[00:50:28.538 --> 00:50:30.300]  Do you understand that?
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.321]  Do you get that?
[00:50:31.321 --> 00:50:35.747]  The Kurds are burning down Turkey right now, saying Turkey is behind Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:50:37.008 --> 00:50:37.748]  And they're right.
[00:50:37.748 --> 00:50:39.349]  And the Kurds don't like being murdered en masse.
[00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:40.409]  They're tired of it.
[00:50:40.409 --> 00:50:41.329]  It's gonna be the same thing.
[00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:42.410]  You understand?
[00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:45.670]  Just like the Kurds know turkeys with Al-Qaeda, we know.
[00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:49.231]  And no amount of name-changing will put upty-dumpty back together again.
[00:50:49.231 --> 00:50:57.914]  All the king's horses and all the king's PR spin doctors can't put your Wahhabi-ist Saudi Arabian crud together again.

[00:51:58.464 --> 00:52:01.287]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:01.287 --> 00:52:06.412]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.412 --> 00:52:14.539]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:14.539 --> 00:52:19.063]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:19.063 --> 00:52:22.867]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:23.027 --> 00:52:28.971]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:32.133]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:32.133 --> 00:52:37.497]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:54:06.221 --> 00:54:07.642]  Report!
[00:54:07.642 --> 00:54:12.223]  Military preparing to respond to Ferguson riots.
[00:54:12.223 --> 00:54:18.664]  Missouri sources say authorities plan to shut down airports.
[00:54:29.787 --> 00:54:36.091]  This is huge news up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com just broke.
[00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:40.154]  Michael Savage trying to stop an impending civil war.
[00:54:40.154 --> 00:54:41.635]  That's the globalist plan.
[00:54:41.635 --> 00:54:43.296]  Stop the coming civil wars is a new book.
[00:54:43.296 --> 00:54:48.519]  He's joining us coming up in about five after next hour.
[00:54:48.519 --> 00:54:50.541]  Some of the other news on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:51.977 --> 00:54:52.797]  Breaking U.S.
[00:54:52.797 --> 00:54:55.018]  orders agents to monitor travelers for Ebola.
[00:54:55.018 --> 00:54:58.980]  Finally, Nebraska school bans the term boys and girls.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.742]  Train teachers to avoid gendered expression.
[00:55:01.742 --> 00:55:08.505]  See, any communication, any true diversity is bad under political correctness.
[00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:15.828]  Yoga studios are banning talking about India or even wearing Indian style clothes because that's a style that's popular.
[00:55:15.828 --> 00:55:20.971]  And now they've announced the victory over Japan statue that shows the sailor kissing the nurse.
[00:55:22.415 --> 00:55:24.707]  Let me tell you, when the men got home from World War II, the women were waiting.
[00:55:25.834 --> 00:55:28.074]  And the girls, you know, like to be taken in your arms.
[00:55:28.074 --> 00:55:29.475]  They love it.
[00:55:29.475 --> 00:55:37.696]  Well, now feminist groups are coming out, calling for the statue to be taken down, saying it's sexual assault for a woman to fall into the arms of a man.
[00:55:37.696 --> 00:55:39.456]  No, that's called life on earth.
[00:55:39.456 --> 00:55:40.297]  That's called passion.
[00:55:40.297 --> 00:55:41.837]  That's called what makes the world go round.
[00:55:41.837 --> 00:55:43.377]  What a bunch of sick freaks.
[00:55:43.377 --> 00:55:44.437]  And everyone will do what they say.
[00:55:44.437 --> 00:55:46.098]  They'll probably cut it down now.
[00:55:46.098 --> 00:55:48.858]  It's all about extremism, about doing what they say.
[00:55:48.858 --> 00:55:53.019]  You're pro-family, pro-property, pro-freedom, pro-Thomas Jefferson, you're evil.
[00:55:54.209 --> 00:55:56.031]  You're a horrible, gibbering, control freak.
[00:55:56.031 --> 00:56:02.156]  You're wonderful.
[00:56:02.156 --> 00:56:05.478]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to some of your phone calls in this segment and the next.
[00:56:05.478 --> 00:56:07.700]  Bill in California, you're on the air.
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.941]  Thanks for calling.
[00:56:08.941 --> 00:56:10.642]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:56:10.642 --> 00:56:12.644]  I have two comments, please.
[00:56:12.644 --> 00:56:16.868]  My first comment is, I think you should stay in the radio studio.
[00:56:16.868 --> 00:56:21.411]  It's really great, and give the TV studio to the reporters.
[00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:23.253]  And my second comment... Is that the story about Ebola?
[00:56:24.093 --> 00:56:26.834]  Yes it is, for Ebola.
[00:56:26.834 --> 00:56:33.938]  The cure for Ebola can be found if you listen to the song Take Action by Joseph Israel.
[00:56:33.938 --> 00:56:39.421]  Yahweh will cure all the diseases and vitamin C cures Ebola.
[00:56:39.421 --> 00:56:43.823]  So Yahweh will destroy Babylon and will gather the Israelites.
[00:56:44.823 --> 00:56:46.465]  Good, I appreciate your call.
[00:56:46.465 --> 00:56:50.868]  We don't screen calls so folks can hear differing, interesting views like that.
[00:56:50.868 --> 00:56:59.675]  It's been proven by Linus Pauling and the Nobel Prize that mega doses of vitamin C will only upset your stomach as the only side effect and do amazing things.
[00:56:59.675 --> 00:57:01.236]  I don't think you can say will cure it.
[00:57:01.236 --> 00:57:02.937]  It's all different for different people.
[00:57:02.937 --> 00:57:10.463]  But yeah, anything that boosts your mitochondria, boosts your DNA, vitamin C is known to do that.
[00:57:10.463 --> 00:57:11.283]  The stuff that's in
[00:57:12.284 --> 00:57:14.725]  Well, just go read about DNA Force at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:57:14.725 --> 00:57:17.647]  Do you think vitamin C is powerful?
[00:57:17.647 --> 00:57:21.169]  Well, this is exponentially more powerful.
[00:57:21.169 --> 00:57:24.050]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Pennsylvania.
[00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:24.610]  You're on the air.
[00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:25.531]  Go ahead.
[00:57:25.531 --> 00:57:26.772]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:57:26.772 --> 00:57:38.198]  I was wondering if you've heard about the story up here in Pennsylvania that's been ongoing now since September the 12th, when a state trooper was killed and ambushed right outside of the state trooper barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania.
[00:57:38.198 --> 00:57:38.918]  Yes, I am aware of it.
[00:57:39.662 --> 00:57:41.403]  They are still looking for this character.
[00:57:41.403 --> 00:57:49.166]  Now what I'm wondering is, is this a false flag, or is this something that is a lone wolf, or is it homegrown terrorism?
[00:57:49.166 --> 00:57:53.808]  It sounds to me like a real psychopath that was into video games and war gaming.
[00:57:53.808 --> 00:57:55.069]  Sounds like a psychopath.
[00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:56.709]  They love to taunt the police.
[00:57:56.709 --> 00:57:57.490]  It fits the M.O.
[00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:58.890]  of a real guy from my research.
[00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:02.952]  I followed it extensively, we've mentioned it some, but if you look at the real M.O.
[00:58:02.952 --> 00:58:07.294]  of this guy and the way the media handled it, I think he's a psychopath who wants to hunt police.
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:10.141]  Well, a couple of weeks ago, they had a press conference.
[00:58:10.141 --> 00:58:11.823]  You might find this interesting.
[00:58:11.823 --> 00:58:24.732]  When the one reporter asked the state trooper that was given the conference if this person had been previously been involved with a psychiatrist or psychiatric medication, and the officer doing the press conference says, we cannot answer that.
[00:58:24.732 --> 00:58:26.613]  We have to decline on any remarks.
[00:58:26.613 --> 00:58:31.357]  Yeah, I remember seeing the word as he'd been under psychiatric care, which you can then bet he was on it.
[00:58:32.237 --> 00:58:36.222]  And again, that stuff just takes a violent nut and pushes them over the edge.
[00:58:36.222 --> 00:58:37.123]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:37.123 --> 00:58:37.603]  Stay with us.
[00:58:37.603 --> 00:58:38.484]  More calls.
[00:58:38.484 --> 00:58:40.847]  Michael Savage, coming up.
[00:58:40.847 --> 00:58:42.949]  Can we stop the coming civil war?
[00:58:42.949 --> 00:58:43.510]  Stay with us.
[00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:45.272]  Visit UCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.164 --> 00:58:56.333]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:58:56.333 --> 00:58:58.696]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:58:58.696 --> 00:59:03.962]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:03.962 --> 00:59:08.908]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:09.128 --> 00:59:12.449]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:12.449 --> 00:59:16.510]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:20.851]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:20.851 --> 00:59:31.054]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:31.054 --> 00:59:33.575]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:59:33.795 --> 00:59:36.298]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.204 --> 01:00:06.505]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.505 --> 01:00:08.267]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.267 --> 01:00:10.028]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.028 --> 01:00:11.629]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.629 --> 01:00:13.151]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:17.354]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.354 --> 01:00:21.477]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.996 --> 01:00:32.179]  Now into hour number two, Michael Savage coming up with the balance of the hour.
[01:00:32.179 --> 01:00:37.783]  His new book, Stop the Coming Civil War, couldn't be a more important subject to cover.
[01:00:37.783 --> 01:00:41.666]  Kevin in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:00:41.666 --> 01:00:42.367]  How you doing Alex?
[01:00:42.367 --> 01:00:42.807]  Good.
[01:00:42.807 --> 01:00:49.253]  I was wanting to check on the, I was wanting to talk to you about the Ebola thing and where I think it might be going.
[01:00:49.253 --> 01:00:52.495]  From what I've been seeing, we're starting to drop call off that.
[01:00:52.495 --> 01:00:54.357]  It goes along with the Wildlands Project, Matt.
[01:00:55.585 --> 01:01:01.030]  I haven't seen it coming anywhere near the megacities they're planning on building up.
[01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:17.704]  And I'm just, I'm just in there throwing out this little war game plan on there that they might plan on starting a vaccine in those cities, and when they say they've reached enough vaccines, they'll cut off the rest of the people coming up to the megacities to get cured whenever it starts busting out before they fall in the country.
[01:01:19.138 --> 01:01:20.578]  Well, that's exactly what will happen.
[01:01:20.578 --> 01:01:22.279]  That's what the Pentagon is saying.
[01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:27.760]  General, if Ebola reaches Central America, there will be mass migration to the U.S.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.720]  Wherever this stuff starts breaking out, people will race in all different directions.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:36.281]  Bigger than the death toll, even if it's a few hundred or a few thousand, it's going to cause super panic.
[01:01:36.281 --> 01:01:40.502]  And the government's doing everything you do if you want it to spread.
[01:01:40.502 --> 01:01:44.483]  Do you disagree with that statement?
[01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:45.183]  No, I do not.
[01:01:47.112 --> 01:01:48.593]  I wish somebody did.
[01:01:48.593 --> 01:01:54.775]  I see how it's going and the way they're saying it's actually, that's the way it's going.
[01:01:54.775 --> 01:01:55.675]  Well God bless you brother.
[01:01:55.675 --> 01:01:59.756]  Let's all just pray about it and hopefully it'll mutate into a harmless form or something.
[01:01:59.756 --> 01:02:01.257]  It hadn't done that in 30 plus years.
[01:02:01.257 --> 01:02:05.278]  Ed in FEMA Region 4.
[01:02:05.278 --> 01:02:08.219]  What former state are you calling from Ed?
[01:02:08.219 --> 01:02:09.139]  North Carolina.
[01:02:09.139 --> 01:02:11.440]  Alright, go ahead.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.061]  I believe that there are six steps to get us back onto the track of
[01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:20.885]  Uh, Liberty, obviously there's a lot more because there's a lot of bullcrap that they've been pulling.
[01:02:20.885 --> 01:02:28.715]  But without these six steps, in my mind, we will never make it back to the state, or the country we were before.
[01:02:28.715 --> 01:02:30.316]  The first is the most important.
[01:02:30.316 --> 01:02:31.278]  Government ties the Fed.
[01:02:32.236 --> 01:02:35.178]  What I said earlier is, I'm going to go to Ebola calls right now.
[01:02:35.178 --> 01:02:37.841]  So if you want to hold until Savage is gone, I can come back to you.
[01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:39.602]  It's open phones in the third hour.
[01:02:39.602 --> 01:02:41.624]  But I said it's Ebola calls, guys.
[01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:43.445]  People need to hear what I'm saying sometimes.
[01:02:43.445 --> 01:02:44.866]  When it's a free-for-all, it's a free-for-all.
[01:02:44.866 --> 01:02:46.167]  If you want to hold, you can.
[01:02:46.167 --> 01:02:52.032]  John is in California, says he is illegal, but agrees with me.
[01:02:52.032 --> 01:02:53.233]  That's what it says on screen.
[01:02:53.233 --> 01:02:53.934]  John, go ahead.
[01:02:53.934 --> 01:02:56.135]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:02:56.135 --> 01:02:56.476]  Good, sir.
[01:02:56.476 --> 01:02:56.756]  Go ahead.
[01:02:57.677 --> 01:02:59.437]  Well, I wasn't talking about Ebola.
[01:02:59.437 --> 01:03:05.359]  I was just basically bringing up the fact that I have been deported and I still do agree with you.
[01:03:05.359 --> 01:03:08.360]  Well, I'm not against even the individual immigrants themselves.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.541]  It's how they're being used by the political class, is what I'm saying.
[01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:13.601]  I agree with you.
[01:03:13.601 --> 01:03:16.542]  But, you know, I am family orientated.
[01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:19.263]  I run two businesses.
[01:03:19.263 --> 01:03:20.623]  I agree with what you're saying.
[01:03:20.623 --> 01:03:23.624]  I mean, does that make me a traitor?
[01:03:23.624 --> 01:03:27.005]  No, but we need to make a way to make people that are productive
[01:03:28.393 --> 01:03:32.616]  Be able to become citizens, but the government doesn't want people like you.
[01:03:32.616 --> 01:03:34.957]  They want people that want a free ride to bankrupt the country.
[01:03:34.957 --> 01:03:35.518]  That's the plan.
[01:03:35.518 --> 01:03:39.861]  So how do we deal with that?
[01:03:39.861 --> 01:03:40.701]  I don't know.
[01:03:40.701 --> 01:03:42.482]  I wish I had the answer.
[01:03:42.482 --> 01:03:49.767]  I wish I did too, because when you're playing against an adversary that doesn't follow any rules and is completely evil, how do you defeat them?
[01:03:49.767 --> 01:03:51.408]  You block anything they support.
[01:03:51.408 --> 01:03:55.751]  Even though they may have good reasons for a lot of what they're doing, their intent is evil.
[01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:56.392]  Do you see the difference?
[01:03:57.441 --> 01:04:17.848]  Yeah, well, I think that if you were to maybe, you know, have a bilingual show or something to, you know... I absolutely, totally agree with you that if I could launch my other projects and get things done, that the first thing we'd do would be have World Spanish Service InfoWars News.
[01:04:17.848 --> 01:04:24.950]  But then I've got to vet everything those reporters say and do, and I've got to deal with it, and I've got to, I mean, believe me, that is in the pipeline.
[01:04:26.274 --> 01:04:35.423]  Well, you know, I agree with you, and I think that there's a lot more Hispanics that do agree with you, and I feel that maybe they are being categorized by a lot of other people.
[01:04:35.423 --> 01:04:35.943]  No, I know.
[01:04:35.943 --> 01:04:43.811]  The media says if you're Hispanic, you support getting rid of the family, turning your guns in, and worshipping world government, and that's not what most Hispanics support.
[01:04:43.811 --> 01:04:48.636]  But as a political bloc with the illegals, they do over 90% vote for whatever the Democrats say.
[01:04:49.096 --> 01:04:53.660]  And then you got Republicans, their loyal opposition, like Boehner, who funds Obamacare and everything else.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:57.943]  So, between that political combination, only a total wake-up can stop it.
[01:04:57.943 --> 01:04:59.264]  Michael Savage, coming up.
[01:04:59.264 --> 01:05:09.833]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:15.918]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:05:33.431 --> 01:05:38.197]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:05:38.197 --> 01:05:39.518]  Talk about the effects.
[01:05:39.518 --> 01:05:41.040]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.963]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:05:42.963 --> 01:05:44.084]  I feel like I look better.
[01:05:44.084 --> 01:05:44.785]  I feel better.
[01:05:44.785 --> 01:05:45.846]  I feel sexier.
[01:05:45.846 --> 01:05:46.807]  I love it.

[01:06:28.743 --> 01:06:32.405]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:36.687]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:36.687 --> 01:06:38.468]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:38.468 --> 01:06:46.332]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:06:46.332 --> 01:06:47.473]  But for how long?
[01:06:47.473 --> 01:06:54.116]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:54.116 --> 01:06:56.938]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:58.467 --> 01:07:07.136]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:07:07.136 --> 01:07:13.363]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:19.307]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here, Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:19.307 --> 01:07:32.155]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:07:32.155 --> 01:07:38.899]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients.
[01:07:39.079 --> 01:07:41.440]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.057 --> 01:08:15.738]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:15.738 --> 01:08:16.338]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:16.338 --> 01:08:16.898]  Central.
[01:08:16.898 --> 01:08:17.938]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:08:17.938 --> 01:08:18.638]  Eastern.
[01:08:18.638 --> 01:08:26.100]  We are here, live, broadcasting worldwide, back weeknights, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:30.481]  The news websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:38.343]  I've always believed that using information warfare and telling the truth, we can defeat the mountain of lies being put out by the collectivist and the globalist.
[01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:44.635]  And we can stop them building their prison planet, thus the term prison planet.
[01:08:44.635 --> 01:08:55.100]  Now we're joined for the rest of the hour, the next 52 minutes, by Dr. Michael Savage, a multimedia icon in the conservative libertarian constitutional movement.
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:59.202]  Dr. Savage holds a master's degree in medical botany and a second in
[01:09:00.723 --> 01:09:02.364]  A lot of other key research areas.
[01:09:02.364 --> 01:09:04.464]  Additionally, he earned his Ph.D.
[01:09:04.464 --> 01:09:09.246]  from the University of California at Berkeley in Epidemiology and Nutrition Sciences.
[01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:13.627]  He is the author of 25 books, including four New York Times bestsellers.
[01:09:13.627 --> 01:09:19.909]  He earned the coveted Freedom of Speech Award from Talkers Magazine in 2007. michaelsavage.com or michaelsavage.wnd.com
[01:09:24.429 --> 01:09:37.700]  And when I got his new book in a few days ago and had a chance to start reading it, I haven't finished it yet, it was literally like reading Veritas, because I'm not plagiarizing him, he's not plagiarizing me.
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:46.127]  Anybody that's sat back for 20 years like I have, 40-something years like he has, or longer, and watched what's going on, we're repeating history.
[01:09:46.127 --> 01:09:50.231]  But the way he puts it and lays it out really even lit a fire under my butt.
[01:09:51.258 --> 01:09:53.719]  The book is Stop the Coming Civil War.
[01:09:53.719 --> 01:09:54.759]  I intend to finish it tonight.
[01:09:54.759 --> 01:09:56.559]  I've got about three chapters left.
[01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:58.680]  It's a big book, but a powerful read.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.620]  I have no stock in it.
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:02.701]  I intend to sell it later, as soon as we can get it in.
[01:10:02.701 --> 01:10:11.083]  It's Stop the Coming Civil War, My Savage Truth, Michael Savage, number one New York Times bestselling author.
[01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:18.345]  Everything you see with Homeland Security has been flipped from Al Qaeda and radical Islam to Tea Party, gun owners, returning veterans.
[01:10:19.826 --> 01:10:32.895]  Libertarian groups, constitutionalists, pro-life groups, the IRS persecuting them, going after free speech, banning Halloween parties, dressing like cowboys or Indians at colleges.
[01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.356]  It's a tyranny.
[01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:36.737]  These people are not liberals like Thomas Jefferson.
[01:10:36.737 --> 01:10:40.600]  They are autocratic control freaks like Joseph Stalin.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:49.206]  And Dr. Savage has been exposing this for decade after decade after decade and now it's coming to a head.
[01:10:49.206 --> 01:10:53.289]  Homeland Security is fully converting over to go after the American people.
[01:10:53.289 --> 01:10:57.052]  The gun confiscation has already begun in New York, California and other areas.
[01:10:58.153 --> 01:11:01.795]  The persecution is right out of Nazi Germany.
[01:11:01.795 --> 01:11:11.139]  Hitler, from 1933 to about 1939, ratcheted up political harassment, audits, going after businesses of groups he didn't like.
[01:11:11.139 --> 01:11:16.402]  We're seeing a Cold War against anyone loyal to common sense and freedom.
[01:11:16.402 --> 01:11:19.423]  Now, I'm done ranting.
[01:11:19.423 --> 01:11:21.184]  I want to give Dr. Savage the floor here.
[01:11:22.136 --> 01:11:29.675]  But he gets it, I get it, a few others get it, Joseph Farah gets it, but undoubtedly, and I talked to top Pentagon brass...
[01:11:31.067 --> 01:11:32.368]  On air and off air.
[01:11:32.368 --> 01:11:33.689]  I have top CIA sources.
[01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:34.790]  You hear them here.
[01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:37.452]  People that are on my show right after they brief Congress.
[01:11:37.452 --> 01:11:40.655]  The military knows Obama and others are funding radical Islam.
[01:11:40.655 --> 01:11:41.836]  They know the borders are open.
[01:11:41.836 --> 01:11:43.737]  They know they're letting Ebola in.
[01:11:43.737 --> 01:11:45.579]  They know they're shutting down the power plants.
[01:11:45.579 --> 01:11:49.562]  They know they're shutting down the businesses and passing taxes to kill the country.
[01:11:49.562 --> 01:11:52.004]  This is to bankrupt us under Cloward and Piven.
[01:11:52.004 --> 01:11:52.885]  But it's beyond that.
[01:11:52.885 --> 01:11:56.427]  And now they want to start a civil war with Obama at its head.
[01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:58.932]  As the new Lincoln.
[01:11:58.932 --> 01:12:01.256]  Now Savage has been saying that for eight years.
[01:12:01.256 --> 01:12:01.777]  They're now...
[01:12:02.975 --> 01:12:04.656]  Making all the preparations to do it.
[01:12:04.656 --> 01:12:06.557]  His book is so timely.
[01:12:06.557 --> 01:12:09.019]  It is the talking points of truth.
[01:12:09.019 --> 01:12:18.345]  It could end up being one of the most important books of the modern era if people get it and get it out to others and if every talk show host covers these points because I've been living this.
[01:12:18.345 --> 01:12:21.187]  I know this is accurate and it's finally on paper.
[01:12:21.187 --> 01:12:23.548]  I never got Obama Deception 2 out.
[01:12:23.548 --> 01:12:24.549]  I was too busy.
[01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:27.391]  Its subtitle was The Coming Second American Civil War.
[01:12:28.436 --> 01:12:29.177]  Okay?
[01:12:29.177 --> 01:12:34.321]  So thank God this got put out, but from his gravitas perspective.
[01:12:34.321 --> 01:12:43.287]  Now, I'm hyperventilating here, sir, because if people don't pay attention to this, we're not going to save this country, and it's going to collapse in my view.
[01:12:43.287 --> 01:12:43.988]  Am I wrong?
[01:12:43.988 --> 01:12:44.588]  Am I right?
[01:12:44.588 --> 01:12:45.289]  You've got the floor.
[01:12:46.769 --> 01:12:51.232]  Well, people, I want to start from the point of view of the doubters and the skeptics, Alex.
[01:12:51.232 --> 01:12:55.255]  I always think about what the people listening to me who don't agree with us think.
[01:12:55.255 --> 01:13:01.439]  Some of them are intelligent, obviously, and they listen to us because they know we're super intelligent, but they don't agree with us.
[01:13:01.439 --> 01:13:03.020]  They think we're hysterics or alarmists.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:07.143]  So I would start by addressing those who say, come on, you're just trying to peddle a book.
[01:13:07.143 --> 01:13:07.903]  What civil war?
[01:13:07.903 --> 01:13:12.046]  Well, first of all, Obama declared a civil war the day he took office.
[01:13:12.046 --> 01:13:14.367]  Didn't he say he was going to transform America?
[01:13:14.367 --> 01:13:16.569]  Didn't he say he was a transformational president?
[01:13:17.029 --> 01:13:19.790]  Well, he's done everything he said he was going to do, but not entirely.
[01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:20.751]  He's done it in six years.
[01:13:20.751 --> 01:13:23.472]  A very good job for the globalists.
[01:13:23.472 --> 01:13:27.133]  Take a look at every aspect of this government.
[01:13:27.133 --> 01:13:28.814]  And I don't mean just the government.
[01:13:28.814 --> 01:13:30.635]  Each chapter is interesting.
[01:13:30.635 --> 01:13:34.036]  I rephrase before I publish it to the war on.
[01:13:34.036 --> 01:13:35.697]  The war on our borders language culture.
[01:13:35.697 --> 01:13:38.718]  Can anyone listening to Alex's show right now say that
[01:13:39.798 --> 01:13:43.140]  They have not attacked the borders, our language and our culture.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.060]  How about the war in the U.S.
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:44.561]  military?
[01:13:44.561 --> 01:13:46.202]  The war on American medicine?
[01:13:46.202 --> 01:13:46.642]  Uh-huh.
[01:13:46.642 --> 01:13:47.782]  I'll talk about Ebola.
[01:13:47.782 --> 01:13:51.084]  If you like your Ebola, you can keep your Ebola.
[01:13:51.084 --> 01:13:56.887]  If you like your EV-68 virus in your child's school, you can keep your EV-68.
[01:13:56.887 --> 01:13:59.629]  It was brought in by the trainload from Central America this summer.
[01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:03.333]  What I love most is I did a chapter of the war on civil rights.
[01:14:03.333 --> 01:14:06.395]  Obama poses as the great champion of civil rights.
[01:14:06.395 --> 01:14:07.236]  Oh really?
[01:14:07.236 --> 01:14:09.778]  Tell that to those targeted by the IRS.
[01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:12.840]  Tell that to those being snooped on by the NSA.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.621]  What civil rights?
[01:14:13.621 --> 01:14:16.904]  You mean for the rioters and the freeloaders and the grifters?
[01:14:16.904 --> 01:14:19.966]  Seems they have civil rights and the rest of us don't.
[01:14:19.966 --> 01:14:24.610]  The war in our schools, who can argue that our schools are better than they were before it took office?
[01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:27.373]  The children are dumber than they've ever been.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:31.423]  We are now below that of, I think, Nicaragua in learning.
[01:14:31.423 --> 01:14:32.944]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:14:32.944 --> 01:14:38.629]  When I first moved to California, I loved the fact that I was a poor grad student that had two children.
[01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:39.850]  God bless them.
[01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:41.992]  And I knew I could never afford to send them to private school.
[01:14:41.992 --> 01:14:42.953]  The University of California
[01:14:43.942 --> 01:14:47.244]  Cal State Public Schools were at the top of the heap in the country.
[01:14:47.244 --> 01:14:48.704]  You know where they are now?
[01:14:48.704 --> 01:14:49.825]  About that of Tijuana.
[01:14:49.825 --> 01:14:51.626]  I wonder how that happened.
[01:14:51.626 --> 01:14:59.390]  So whatever you look at, whatever this person has touched and his radical leftist band of not-so-merry pranksters has been decimated.
[01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:02.311]  So he has declared a civil war on us, Alex.
[01:15:02.311 --> 01:15:04.372]  It's not like, oh, there's going to be a civil war.
[01:15:04.372 --> 01:15:05.233]  There is a civil war.
[01:15:06.089 --> 01:15:12.092]  But it's the type that you've been talking about for years, the Cloven Hoof Method.
[01:15:12.092 --> 01:15:14.454]  I mean a Clovis Pivot Method or whatever.
[01:15:14.454 --> 01:15:18.936]  We've all known the little secret methods that they've used, but call it the Cloven Hoof Method.
[01:15:18.936 --> 01:15:21.117]  You don't have to start a civil war with a gun.
[01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:29.142]  It's far more effective if you do it through brainwashing, and you own the press, and you own the media, and there's a government media complex which we know exists.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:39.986]  All along, Alex, I prayed that there would be some godsend that would save us from this psychotic in the White House and his band of very, very dangerous people.
[01:15:39.986 --> 01:15:46.030]  You're going to think I'm a little weird here when I say that Ebola may be the silver lining.
[01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:54.575]  Maybe that's going to awaken people to the fact that this man is not only incompetent, but that his radical open borders agenda is going to kill all of us.
[01:15:54.575 --> 01:15:55.916]  Just maybe.
[01:15:55.916 --> 01:15:57.217]  This could be a blessing.
[01:15:57.217 --> 01:15:58.278]  What do you think of that idea?
[01:16:00.177 --> 01:16:01.198]  I tend to agree with you.
[01:16:01.198 --> 01:16:03.120]  There's now bumper stickers popping up everywhere.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:15.273]  We already had a t-shirt in the pipe showing the Obama symbol as the O in Ebola and the fact that they totally opened up the borders
[01:16:15.854 --> 01:16:32.682]  While they're taking our basic liberties with the NSA spying on the Tea Party, the fact that they have Homeland Security saying their main threat is the Tea Party, with no violence from the Tea Party, I'm really concerned, like you said a few years ago, that they could pull a false flag and try to blame it on the Liberty Movement.
[01:16:32.682 --> 01:16:33.503]  Thank you.
[01:16:33.503 --> 01:16:36.084]  That's the whole book, Stop the Coming Civil War.
[01:16:36.084 --> 01:16:39.886]  I warn the readers that they're going to provoke an insurrection.
[01:16:40.816 --> 01:17:02.526]  with our Jean provocateurs as a pretext for either martial law or seizing weapons or worse than that people say well it's only two more years left of him BS you actually think this guy's gonna leave office in two years I'm not so sure by the way I used to disagree when people said he would stay but now I see they're going for broke we've never seen anything like this
[01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:05.638]  No, I've never seen anything like it.
[01:17:05.638 --> 01:17:10.943]  So, you know, Alex, look, I am trying to get people to read the book, obviously.
[01:17:10.943 --> 01:17:12.605]  I don't need to buy a new car.
[01:17:12.605 --> 01:17:13.846]  I don't need to buy a new house.
[01:17:13.846 --> 01:17:16.048]  I don't need a vacation in Boca Raton.
[01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:18.410]  I'm not looking to buy any more bling.
[01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:20.192]  As you can see, I have a lot of it on my hands.
[01:17:20.192 --> 01:17:21.253]  You don't need to work 15 hours a day.
[01:17:22.774 --> 01:17:23.634]  No.
[01:17:23.634 --> 01:17:24.115]  No.
[01:17:24.115 --> 01:17:25.735]  I'm 72 years old, Alex.
[01:17:25.735 --> 01:17:31.638]  I was a Boy Scout when I was a young kid who went around the neighborhood putting out Get Out The Vote cards on doorknobs.
[01:17:31.638 --> 01:17:39.301]  My father called the police at 11 at night because I got so into thinking I was a good American, I forgot the time and I worked my little heart out.
[01:17:39.301 --> 01:17:42.062]  Every doorknob in Queens, New York, I hung Get Out The Vote.
[01:17:42.062 --> 01:17:43.283]  I thought I was doing some good.
[01:17:43.283 --> 01:17:44.343]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:17:44.343 --> 01:17:47.044]  But the fact of the matter is we're all doing some good.
[01:17:47.044 --> 01:17:50.906]  And if you look at the headline on Drudge, Party Isolates Prez for Election.
[01:17:52.026 --> 01:17:55.307]  Even his own party recognizes how unpopular he is, Alex.
[01:17:55.307 --> 01:17:57.228]  So, what's going on?
[01:17:57.228 --> 01:17:59.489]  Are people awakening to him?
[01:17:59.489 --> 01:18:01.309]  Or what?
[01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:04.731]  You know, Alex, I gotta tell you this in terms of raw numbers.
[01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:10.173]  Yesterday, WorldNetDaily did an article on the book and it said, 30 Days to Save America as the head and the leader.
[01:18:10.173 --> 01:18:11.233]  It was a good article on the book.
[01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:13.712]  You know that it was linked on Drudge.
[01:18:13.712 --> 01:18:16.715]  They had 1.2 million hits as of this morning on that one article.
[01:18:16.715 --> 01:18:18.978]  Can you believe that in one day?
[01:18:18.978 --> 01:18:20.199]  So how is this happening?
[01:18:20.199 --> 01:18:21.461]  Who's reading this?
[01:18:21.461 --> 01:18:22.522]  Facebook?
[01:18:22.522 --> 01:18:24.284]  It was one of the leading stories yesterday.
[01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:26.847]  Well, are they waking up or what?
[01:18:26.847 --> 01:18:28.288]  Or is it just a joke to them?
[01:18:28.288 --> 01:18:29.149]  I don't really know, Alex.
[01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.472]  Well, they better wake up because they've got the military.
[01:18:32.472 --> 01:18:37.055]  The military's never been more awake, as you know, because they're openly training them.
[01:18:37.055 --> 01:18:47.903]  It even comes out in Fox News, not just your show or my show, but I was sent the documents originally, that quote, the Founding Fathers wouldn't be welcome in today's military, that you better not be part of the Tea Party or an evangelical.
[01:18:47.903 --> 01:18:53.166]  What country did we wake up in where they threaten to court-martial people if they're a Christian?
[01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:56.569]  I mean, that is just Communist China on steroids.
[01:18:57.694 --> 01:19:01.035]  Michael Savage warns of Second Civil War, a new book.
[01:19:01.035 --> 01:19:04.676]  Michael Savage, Conservative Radio, warns of Civil War.
[01:19:04.676 --> 01:19:11.138]  Some of the headlines on some of the smaller blogs, Conservative Radio, talk shows, Michael Savage warns of coming Civil War.
[01:19:11.138 --> 01:19:14.399]  But ask yourself why I am not invited on Fox News, Alex.
[01:19:14.399 --> 01:19:15.739]  Are you a guest on Fox News?
[01:19:15.739 --> 01:19:17.019]  No.
[01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:18.320]  No, not anymore.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.580]  I'm told I'm banned.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:20.680]  Are you banned?
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:21.741]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:21.741 --> 01:19:22.501]  You're also banned.
[01:19:23.177 --> 01:19:25.619]  Well, okay, you're Ray-Banned like I am.
[01:19:25.619 --> 01:19:27.561]  They Ray-Banned you.
[01:19:27.561 --> 01:19:28.882]  I wonder what that's about.
[01:19:28.882 --> 01:19:32.585]  Couldn't be related to Murdoch supporting Hillary, could it?
[01:19:32.585 --> 01:19:34.026]  I know he does support her.
[01:19:34.026 --> 01:19:35.387]  And again, what's wrong with him?
[01:19:35.387 --> 01:19:39.090]  I mean, there's going to be no country if Hillary gets in.
[01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:40.191]  Well, I can answer that.
[01:19:40.191 --> 01:19:41.893]  I pretty much know what's going on there.
[01:19:41.893 --> 01:19:44.715]  Look, their licenses are owned by the federal government.
[01:19:44.715 --> 01:19:46.236]  The FCC controls licensing.
[01:19:46.236 --> 01:19:46.637]  You know that.
[01:19:47.338 --> 01:19:50.379]  There's a big, you know, there's a big tug of war going on.
[01:19:50.379 --> 01:19:51.879]  They're saying, you want to stay in business?
[01:19:51.879 --> 01:19:52.859]  Fine.
[01:19:52.859 --> 01:19:57.200]  You want to buy radio stations in the same city on TV stations and newspapers?
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.860]  Okay, then here's what we need.
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:19:59.540]  It's a trade-off.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.741]  That's why I fear the government media complex.
[01:20:01.741 --> 01:20:11.983]  Alex, in the 60s, we were warned by the liberals, because I was a kid in, I wasn't a kid, I was 20 years old, that the interlocking corporate directorships were to be avoided.
[01:20:11.983 --> 01:20:13.583]  That was the liberal credo of the time.
[01:20:14.241 --> 01:20:17.562]  Watch out for the interlocking corporate directorships, right?
[01:20:17.562 --> 01:20:24.104]  Well now you've got newspapers, television owners, newspaper owners, radio owners, all in one city, right?
[01:20:24.104 --> 01:20:26.685]  How's that for interlocking corporate directorships?
[01:20:26.685 --> 01:20:34.248]  And the same directors sit on the boards of medical device companies, pharmaceutical companies, universities.
[01:20:34.248 --> 01:20:42.371]  So you've got a seamless corporate fascism that has emerged in America because of the conglomeration of all in one basket.
[01:20:43.373 --> 01:21:02.294]  That's right, but the classic Napoleon or Hitler scenario, where they got power over their own country, they got power over their own system, but they don't have power over the laws of nature, and now they're so arrogant out in the open, and Congress has a 7% approval rating, the military is awakening to the point of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs goes to
[01:21:02.975 --> 01:21:07.517]  The Senate Armed Services Committee admits that we're funding the radical Islamists.
[01:21:07.517 --> 01:21:11.458]  The military brass I talked to are totally upset.
[01:21:11.458 --> 01:21:14.499]  The police I talked to have never been more awake.
[01:21:14.499 --> 01:21:18.580]  So it's almost like a best of times, worst of times tale of two cities.
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:20.401]  There is the huge awakening happening.
[01:21:21.101 --> 01:21:31.927]  But the corrupt crony capitalists that have teamed up with the socialists as their political team to control the population don't care and are just saying, Marie Antoinette, let them eat cake.
[01:21:31.927 --> 01:21:47.535]  I mean, she didn't really say that, famously before the Bastille got stormed, but our political elite are saying let them eat cake as Obamacare bankrupts the country and raises payroll taxes and has death panels, all confirmed, and then John Boehner funds it.
[01:21:48.175 --> 01:21:50.777]  Why is John Boehner still the Speaker of the House?
[01:21:50.777 --> 01:21:53.199]  What is wrong with the Republican leadership?
[01:21:53.199 --> 01:21:59.304]  Don't they understand the Socialists, once they get control, are going to take everything they've got?
[01:21:59.304 --> 01:22:03.788]  I can't answer anything about Republicans, but you know, you brought up the military.
[01:22:03.788 --> 01:22:14.457]  That's a sore point for me because we can disagree on a lot of things, but in an age of head-cutting and radical Islam, I think everyone would agree that military, national defense are key.
[01:22:14.457 --> 01:22:14.777]  And yet,
[01:22:15.658 --> 01:22:17.759]  I, in the chapter on the war in the U.S.
[01:22:17.759 --> 01:22:21.661]  military in my book, I actually name the generals that he's purged.
[01:22:21.661 --> 01:22:25.003]  He purged them the way Stalin did, except in a little different way.
[01:22:25.003 --> 01:22:30.706]  Remember when Stalin seized power, he became a madman later on, and he shot his generals.
[01:22:30.706 --> 01:22:35.248]  People don't realize, he shot, he purged the Soviet military of some of the greatest generals.
[01:22:35.728 --> 01:22:37.488]  Because he was afraid they would coup against him.
[01:22:37.488 --> 01:22:39.829]  He killed thousands of officers, hundreds of generals.
[01:22:39.829 --> 01:22:43.150]  Well, Obama's just firing them by threatening to take away their pension.
[01:22:43.150 --> 01:22:44.530]  Now why is he doing it?
[01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:56.613]  Because he recognized, as anyone can see, any student of history, even amateur student history, the one element of this government that could have stood up to this left-wing fanatical insane dictatorship was the military.
[01:22:56.613 --> 01:23:01.514]  So right after Benghazi, four generals were dismissed because they were ready to send aid
[01:23:02.814 --> 01:23:05.938]  And defend the embassy, save Chris Stevens.
[01:23:05.938 --> 01:23:07.900]  They were ready to testify to that effect.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:08.881]  He fired them, including...
[01:23:10.003 --> 01:23:14.926]  A general, African-American general, with 28 years of loyal service to this country, he was dismissed.
[01:23:14.926 --> 01:23:17.307]  Not one word in the media over this, Alex.
[01:23:17.307 --> 01:23:19.869]  I have their names, ranks, and serial numbers.
[01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:21.149]  And stop the coming civil war.
[01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:22.230]  That was the beginning.
[01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:24.091]  How many majors did we read he was purging?
[01:23:24.091 --> 01:23:25.312]  8,000.
[01:23:25.312 --> 01:23:28.793]  How many captains did we read he was purging and dismissing from the military?
[01:23:28.793 --> 01:23:29.614]  Thousands.
[01:23:29.614 --> 01:23:30.354]  So what's left?
[01:23:30.354 --> 01:23:31.415]  The cannon fodder.
[01:23:31.415 --> 01:23:32.556]  The followers will follow the...
[01:23:33.436 --> 01:23:43.624]  The four horsewomen of the apocalypse surrounding Obama, or worse yet, the Muslim sisterhood which seems to be advising him right inside the White House.
[01:23:43.624 --> 01:23:49.888]  It is a Twilight Zone episode because I would hear you and others talk about the caliphate ten years ago and just go, give me a break.
[01:23:49.888 --> 01:23:56.773]  And then eight years ago when Obama was running for office and now it's like the Twilight Zone with his brother and his cousin fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[01:23:56.773 --> 01:23:59.956]  Why would our government want to overthrow our ally in Egypt and put
[01:24:00.336 --> 01:24:01.477]  Al-Qaeda lied in.
[01:24:01.477 --> 01:24:06.018]  Why would they want to topple Assad and put Al-Qaeda in?
[01:24:06.018 --> 01:24:11.601]  What is the master plan, geopolitically, from your view, Michael Savage, with Russia and all of it?
[01:24:11.601 --> 01:24:14.382]  And then I want to tie it into the hot civil war.
[01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:18.623]  I get from your book, and I agree, we're in a civil war, a culture war, and it's heating up.
[01:24:18.623 --> 01:24:22.305]  But they're pushing this flashpoint, and I want to stop that.
[01:24:23.396 --> 01:24:26.417]  We all want to stop it because nobody wins from a civil war.
[01:24:26.417 --> 01:24:27.377]  Look at Syria.
[01:24:27.377 --> 01:24:28.598]  How many years has it been going on?
[01:24:28.598 --> 01:24:29.638]  How many hundreds of thousands of dead?
[01:24:29.638 --> 01:24:30.318]  Four years.
[01:24:30.318 --> 01:24:31.519]  How many cities are in ruin?
[01:24:31.519 --> 01:24:33.139]  We don't want a civil war.
[01:24:33.139 --> 01:24:37.481]  Here's the scary part, and I hate to use the word because I'm not into childish words.
[01:24:37.481 --> 01:24:39.962]  One of Obama's mentors was Abraham Lincoln.
[01:24:39.962 --> 01:24:40.782]  Isn't that correct?
[01:24:40.782 --> 01:24:41.642]  Oh, yes.
[01:24:41.642 --> 01:24:42.062]  Okay.
[01:24:42.062 --> 01:24:47.524]  Well, Abraham Lincoln was a wonderful man for some, but a monster to others.
[01:24:47.524 --> 01:24:50.925]  People don't even understand what Lincoln did to us.
[01:24:50.925 --> 01:24:52.406]  Lincoln was not a humanitarian.
[01:24:53.427 --> 01:25:00.838]  He was an opportunist who further divided a politically polarized country simply because he wanted to dominate the southern states economically.
[01:25:00.838 --> 01:25:02.380]  He was no saint.
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:03.541]  Do you know this?
[01:25:03.541 --> 01:25:05.104]  Very few people know this about Lincoln.
[01:25:06.281 --> 01:25:10.803]  Uh, and this is very important because Obama has said Lincoln is one of his mentors.
[01:25:10.803 --> 01:25:20.466]  Under the rights that Lincoln granted himself in the 1862 proclamation, a stunning overreach of executive power, Abraham Lincoln violated American civil rights with impunity.
[01:25:20.466 --> 01:25:27.388]  He is estimated to have arrested and imprisoned some 20,000 civilians and detained them without trials.
[01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:28.728]  That was 20,000 in the 1860s.
[01:25:28.728 --> 01:25:29.288]  Members of Congress!
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:36.223]  Yeah, but you know that, I know that, and Obama knows that.
[01:25:36.223 --> 01:25:40.326]  Now, here's another one, Alex, and it's all in Stop the Coming Civil War.
[01:25:40.326 --> 01:25:46.090]  Lincoln kept Southern prisoners of war in internment camps under deplorable conditions.
[01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:48.932]  He may be on a penny, on the old Lincoln penny,
[01:25:49.713 --> 01:25:56.497]  But at Fort Delaware, more than 2,000 Confederate soldiers died of scurvy and dysentery in a camp plagued by filth and vermin.
[01:25:56.497 --> 01:26:03.920]  Confederate prisoners in the Union camp at Rock Island were reduced to eating rats, and with their clothing in rags, were unable to withstand the winter cold.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.302]  They were tortured by being hung by their thumbs.
[01:26:06.302 --> 01:26:08.823]  Now, if that's not the action of a dictator, I don't know what is.
[01:26:08.823 --> 01:26:10.404]  And yet, if you mention one word of this,
[01:26:11.064 --> 01:26:13.006]  Right away they say, oh, so you're in favor of slavery.
[01:26:13.006 --> 01:26:14.687]  No, that's not what I said.
[01:26:14.687 --> 01:26:16.148]  I didn't say that at all.
[01:26:16.148 --> 01:26:19.531]  What I said was, is Lincoln is one of Obama's mentors.
[01:26:19.531 --> 01:26:20.571]  God knows who else is.
[01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:25.135]  It could be Ho Chi Minh, or Mao Tse Tung, or Fidel Castro, or Hugo Chavez.
[01:26:25.135 --> 01:26:28.998]  Well, we know it's Saul Alinsky, and now we have the Hillary papers where she's worshiping him.
[01:26:29.901 --> 01:26:32.103]  Well, you know, people change in time.
[01:26:32.103 --> 01:26:37.708]  Let's hope that Hillary, with all of the money that they've made, have become somewhat capitalistic and a little more greedy.
[01:26:37.708 --> 01:26:39.949]  It's the only thing that could save us, but I doubt it.
[01:26:39.949 --> 01:26:42.091]  Because Leninists were always rich.
[01:26:42.091 --> 01:26:43.272]  I mean, they're not Marxists.
[01:26:43.272 --> 01:26:43.973]  People get it wrong.
[01:26:43.973 --> 01:26:44.914]  They say, oh, they're Marxists.
[01:26:44.914 --> 01:26:45.894]  No, it's not Marxism.
[01:26:45.894 --> 01:26:46.495]  It's Leninism.
[01:26:46.495 --> 01:26:47.736]  It's much different.
[01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:49.938]  You know, it's like a cousin, as you well know.
[01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:51.059]  But it's even beyond that.
[01:26:51.059 --> 01:26:51.859]  I don't know what it is.
[01:26:51.859 --> 01:26:54.782]  I sometimes think that it's not even Marxism or Leninism.
[01:26:54.782 --> 01:26:56.984]  It's pure, unadulterated mafia greed.
[01:26:57.324 --> 01:27:07.876]  That's it, it's mafia masquerading with a pseudo-intellectual communist pantheon to fool a bunch of poor people into becoming slaves in a giant work camp.
[01:27:07.876 --> 01:27:08.356]  Period.
[01:27:08.356 --> 01:27:09.117]  It's all about money.
[01:27:09.994 --> 01:27:14.175]  Do you know how much money is being made on these unaccompanied minors from Central America?
[01:27:14.175 --> 01:27:19.257]  Did you see that article that came out showing how much the Baptist Family Services got from the federal government?
[01:27:19.257 --> 01:27:20.237]  Oh yeah, hundreds of millions.
[01:27:20.237 --> 01:27:27.019]  And each little democratic family, per group of two illegals, gets six to seven thousand a month.
[01:27:27.019 --> 01:27:29.839]  So it's a giant mafia payoff.
[01:27:29.839 --> 01:27:30.880]  Bingo.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.541]  Look at the money, the fortunes that are being made on these children.
[01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:37.082]  Now, let's go to Ebola, which is wakening people up because they're scared.
[01:27:37.082 --> 01:27:37.962]  As I've said before,
[01:27:39.366 --> 01:27:42.667]  You know, this is my field, is epidemics.
[01:27:42.667 --> 01:27:44.708]  Microbes do not discriminate.
[01:27:44.708 --> 01:27:50.390]  Here's the good news, I say to my communist liberal hipster friends with scraggly beards.
[01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:55.652]  The microbes don't know you're a good liberal who love, you know, all of the good things of the world.
[01:27:55.652 --> 01:27:56.452]  They don't know if you're black.
[01:27:57.302 --> 01:28:00.525]  White, Asian, blah blah blah, gay, straight.
[01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:02.987]  All they know is that you're a warm body and a good host.
[01:28:02.987 --> 01:28:07.890]  And they like to proliferate inside warm bodies that are good hosts.
[01:28:07.890 --> 01:28:11.173]  So when an epidemic starts to spread, it will spread.
[01:28:11.173 --> 01:28:14.376]  It'll go to liberals, it'll go to this one, that one.
[01:28:14.376 --> 01:28:15.537]  They're waking up to that.
[01:28:15.537 --> 01:28:19.139]  Even common sense sometimes permeates the most drug-addled brain.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:28.245]  And perhaps, just perhaps, they'll come to understand that my message of borders, language, and culture was not just some crackpot right-wing jargon.
[01:28:28.245 --> 01:28:30.667]  Maybe there's a definition that has meaning.
[01:28:30.667 --> 01:28:33.548]  Why the hell did a nation create borders?
[01:28:33.548 --> 01:28:35.910]  Why did a nation define itself by borders?
[01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:38.552]  Let's start with the most obvious, Alex.
[01:28:38.552 --> 01:28:39.932]  What is a border?
[01:28:39.932 --> 01:28:42.214]  A border is made to keep certain people out, isn't it?
[01:28:43.393 --> 01:28:45.816]  Yeah, it's like having a door on your house.
[01:28:45.816 --> 01:28:48.218]  I mean, it's got a cell wall.
[01:28:48.218 --> 01:28:52.283]  I compare it to every human cell has a cell wall, right?
[01:28:52.283 --> 01:28:52.983]  A membrane.
[01:28:52.983 --> 01:28:53.644]  Yes.
[01:28:53.644 --> 01:28:57.048]  And a plant cell is surrounded by a thick cell membrane.
[01:28:57.048 --> 01:28:59.470]  Well, once the integrity of the membrane is punctured,
[01:29:00.231 --> 01:29:06.757]  The good protoplasm oozes out and bad stuff oozes into the cell and the body gets sick and dies.
[01:29:06.757 --> 01:29:08.900]  That's exactly what a border was created for.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:13.064]  Keep out the bad, protect those on this side.
[01:29:13.064 --> 01:29:15.006]  It's a basic premise of survival.
[01:29:15.486 --> 01:29:16.627]  Dr. Savage, we've got to go to break.
[01:29:16.627 --> 01:29:17.868]  We're going to come back.
[01:29:17.868 --> 01:29:18.909]  And again, he's got a Ph.D.
[01:29:18.909 --> 01:29:25.734]  from the University of California at Berkeley in epidemiology, nutrition sciences, and also in medical anthropology.
[01:29:25.734 --> 01:29:28.436]  So he knows the history of diseases.
[01:29:28.436 --> 01:29:29.597]  He has a Ph.D.
[01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:30.558]  in that, folks.
[01:29:30.558 --> 01:29:33.640]  So we're going to hear from a real expert historically.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:38.384]  Black Plague, you name it, Ebola, what he thinks is going on with Ebola, and why.
[01:29:38.384 --> 01:29:39.045]  My big question.
[01:29:39.045 --> 01:29:39.945]  I want to get his take on this.
[01:29:40.686 --> 01:29:46.775]  Why would the government not stop the flights when everybody else is, and be so obvious?
[01:29:46.775 --> 01:29:48.738]  If there is an epidemic here, how are they going to get away with it?
[01:29:48.738 --> 01:29:50.120]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.643]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.643 --> 01:29:55.327]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:06.586]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:06.586 --> 01:30:08.927]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:08.927 --> 01:30:14.211]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:14.211 --> 01:30:19.395]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:19.395 --> 01:30:21.077]  There are more than 42 million smokers
[01:30:21.377 --> 01:30:21.637]  I think?
[01:30:44.048 --> 01:30:52.237]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:30:52.237 --> 01:30:56.222]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:30:59.321 --> 01:31:08.410]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:31:08.410 --> 01:31:16.819]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:16.819 --> 01:31:21.484]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:31:21.704 --> 01:31:28.488]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:28.488 --> 01:31:35.652]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:31:35.652 --> 01:31:42.676]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:31:42.676 --> 01:31:47.039]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:31:47.039 --> 01:31:50.541]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:50.541 --> 01:31:54.363]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:54.363 --> 01:31:55.544]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:15.768 --> 01:32:20.394]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:20.394 --> 01:32:24.460]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:26.723]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:32:28.755 --> 01:32:33.497]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:32:33.497 --> 01:32:37.318]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:38.559]  Others don't.
[01:32:38.559 --> 01:32:40.700]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.481]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:42.481 --> 01:32:45.362]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:45.362 --> 01:32:52.004]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:52.004 --> 01:32:54.705]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:54.705 --> 01:32:57.066]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:32:57.066 --> 01:32:57.927]  Others don't.
[01:33:09.853 --> 01:33:14.738]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:14.738 --> 01:33:20.564]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.564 --> 01:33:28.372]  Well, I've got to say it, there are not a lot of originals out there in political talk radio.
[01:33:28.372 --> 01:33:33.096]  The main pack kind of follows one mainline Republican view.
[01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:39.171]  But I've got to say, trailblazing in the last 20 years are Michael Savage and Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.171 --> 01:33:44.093]  Michael Savage was a lot bigger than I was before this show became the phenomenon it is right now.
[01:33:44.093 --> 01:33:48.674]  And I quite frankly, I was just talking to him about this during the break, I'm not in competition with him, he's not in competition with me.
[01:33:48.674 --> 01:33:51.135]  Kind of like he works with WorldNet Daily, I plugged him every day.
[01:33:52.316 --> 01:33:53.959]  Uh, or Drudge or anybody else.
[01:33:53.959 --> 01:33:55.581]  I just want to have a free country.
[01:33:55.581 --> 01:33:57.504]  I don't want to see a civil war.
[01:33:57.504 --> 01:34:01.790]  I've got a ranch in East Texas we've had since 1829 that we got Mexican land grant on.
[01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:05.416]  Uh, I just want to live in a free country and raise my three children.
[01:34:05.416 --> 01:34:07.258]  Just like Michael Savage has kids and grandkids.
[01:34:08.147 --> 01:34:11.968]  I mean, there comes a time when you just can't go along with the system.
[01:34:11.968 --> 01:34:30.133]  Now, Michael and I can clearly say I've never done that, but all these other talk show hosts, and all these other Republicans and Democrats and people that Michael was just saying about something like Ebola, doesn't care what color you are, where you're from, or what your sexual preference is, or what race you are, the government's gone insane.
[01:34:30.133 --> 01:34:35.855]  Now, their plan is wreck the country like old-fashioned wreckers and go loot the ship, but
[01:34:37.523 --> 01:34:39.364]  Most folks won't know what a wrecker is.
[01:34:39.364 --> 01:34:42.165]  It's not something that comes in a picture car up when it's parked in the wrong space.
[01:34:42.165 --> 01:34:45.506]  But that's the vulture mentality of the political class.
[01:34:45.506 --> 01:34:51.188]  Look at this news story right here out of KIRO-TV.
[01:34:51.188 --> 01:34:55.329]  CDC not taking extra Ebola precautions at SeaTac Airport.
[01:34:56.639 --> 01:35:00.403]  They are flying in dozens of people every few weeks.
[01:35:00.403 --> 01:35:02.465]  It's over 25 people that have Ebola.
[01:35:02.465 --> 01:35:07.571]  Someone they brought into Spain has now spread Ebola at the hospital and people are getting it.
[01:35:07.571 --> 01:35:10.374]  The Ebola patient in Dallas died.
[01:35:10.374 --> 01:35:12.657]  They didn't even quarantine the family for days.
[01:35:12.657 --> 01:35:15.199]  They didn't clean the ambulance for days.
[01:35:15.199 --> 01:35:18.263]  They are violating the default positions.
[01:35:19.895 --> 01:35:22.297]  Now that's a civil war against America.
[01:35:22.297 --> 01:35:27.340]  When France and England and Saudi Arabia have banned flights a month and a half ago, we don't ban them.
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:30.522]  The CDC comes out and says banning them would make it worse.
[01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:32.624]  That's like saying, you know,
[01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:35.743]  Winning the lottery would make you lose money.
[01:35:35.743 --> 01:35:40.086]  It's just total asinine, 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:35:40.086 --> 01:35:42.628]  Stop the coming civil war.
[01:35:42.628 --> 01:35:52.476]  My Savage Truth, Michael Savage, the new book, available now in bookstores and of course on Amazon and at World Net Daily and everywhere else, michaelsavage.com.
[01:35:52.476 --> 01:35:53.977]  And I don't have stock in the book, folks.
[01:35:53.977 --> 01:35:55.538]  This is what I've been hammering.
[01:35:55.538 --> 01:35:59.000]  He hits a lot of angles I don't hit, hits a lot of angles we do.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.903]  This is great to give people out there and say, hey, love your kids?
[01:36:02.643 --> 01:36:03.304]  Now's the time.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:18.321]  Thank you.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:41.881]  Break down Ebola and then expand how you see things unfolding.
[01:36:41.881 --> 01:36:43.542]  You envisioned it decades ago.
[01:36:43.542 --> 01:36:45.782]  You've been very accurate with the lay of the land.
[01:36:45.782 --> 01:36:47.163]  Totally open borders.
[01:36:47.163 --> 01:36:48.243]  Open treason.
[01:36:48.243 --> 01:36:50.304]  Ten ISIS fighters crossing the border.
[01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:53.805]  Congressman Hunter learned from Homeland Security.
[01:36:53.805 --> 01:36:55.145]  Total stand down.
[01:36:55.145 --> 01:36:56.225]  I want the big picture.
[01:36:56.225 --> 01:37:00.067]  What you think the criminals at Pennsylvania Avenue are planning.
[01:37:00.067 --> 01:37:01.227]  But first, Ebola.
[01:37:02.486 --> 01:37:05.797]  Well, I called him President Obola two weeks ago.
[01:37:05.797 --> 01:37:08.064]  I thought that cute little phrase might stick.
[01:37:08.911 --> 01:37:12.052]  I'm glad to see the Ebola bumper stickers in L.A.
[01:37:12.052 --> 01:37:15.572]  with the O in the middle, but that's not going to get us where we want to go.
[01:37:15.572 --> 01:37:19.513]  This is going to be possibly the lifesaver for America.
[01:37:19.513 --> 01:37:22.254]  There's a clamoring coming up from the people.
[01:37:22.254 --> 01:37:24.594]  They're screaming, what the hell are they doing?
[01:37:24.594 --> 01:37:30.575]  When I saw that Friedkin from CDC speaking saying, don't worry, we're in control, I was screaming.
[01:37:30.575 --> 01:37:32.236]  I know where Friedkin came from.
[01:37:32.236 --> 01:37:33.156]  I know who put him in.
[01:37:34.156 --> 01:37:35.577]  Here's the part that kills me.
[01:37:35.577 --> 01:37:45.306]  Not one person in the medical establishment is speaking out about Ebola in the proper manner, nor about the EV-68 virus from Central America, which is now raging through our schools.
[01:37:45.306 --> 01:37:47.148]  Think about this, Alex.
[01:37:47.148 --> 01:37:52.032]  You would think that several doctors, MPH, epidemiologists, docs,
[01:37:52.873 --> 01:37:57.014]  Would say, wait a minute, we know where the virus comes from with the ED68.
[01:37:57.014 --> 01:37:59.075]  It's endemic in Central America.
[01:37:59.075 --> 01:38:00.275]  We can prove it.
[01:38:00.275 --> 01:38:02.295]  Just look at the DNA of the virus.
[01:38:02.295 --> 01:38:04.536]  No one says a word.
[01:38:04.536 --> 01:38:11.178]  We're living in the ex-Soviet Union in the 1950s, when there was a government, and then there was no medical establishment.
[01:38:11.178 --> 01:38:14.458]  In fact, during the 50s, there was a thing called the Lysenko Affair.
[01:38:14.458 --> 01:38:16.219]  I don't know if anyone remembers that.
[01:38:16.219 --> 01:38:16.639]  I do, yeah.
[01:38:17.677 --> 01:38:20.500]  It was false science put out by the government.
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:25.244]  And if anyone said otherwise, even though scientists knew it was all bull... You know what?
[01:38:25.244 --> 01:38:34.252]  They were dismissed from the universities or put into the... Yeah, they were saying you soak the wheat in the water and it makes it grow better and all this other crazy stuff that killed tens of millions.
[01:38:34.252 --> 01:38:38.576]  Okay, we now have a government scientific medical complex.
[01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:52.955]  Whatever the Four Horsewomen of the Apocalypse say in the White House, the little parrots like Friedkin and Fauci at the NIH repeat like little parrots, we don't have any scientists left in this country.
[01:38:52.955 --> 01:38:53.775]  They're government scientists.
[01:38:53.775 --> 01:38:54.696]  It's like global warming.
[01:38:54.696 --> 01:39:00.059]  They say no one disagrees that global warming's real, pay Al Gore money, even though it's a total fraud on record.
[01:39:00.059 --> 01:39:01.660]  Well, okay, that's one thing.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:05.622]  We know that's just a scam for money for the grifters.
[01:39:05.622 --> 01:39:06.963]  But now the Ebola
[01:39:08.154 --> 01:39:11.538]  This is no longer just greed.
[01:39:11.538 --> 01:39:13.861]  This is going to kill people.
[01:39:13.861 --> 01:39:20.550]  Why have they not stopped flights, as I keep saying, and this is the simplest point I can make to the doubting Thomasettes out there.
[01:39:21.653 --> 01:39:27.236]  African dictators and nations around the Ebola plague nations don't permit them to travel to their countries.
[01:39:27.236 --> 01:39:33.199]  Ipso facto, third world African dictators have more common sense than Barack Ebola.
[01:39:33.199 --> 01:39:34.980]  How is that possible?
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.442]  Why is he not being forced to ban flights?
[01:39:37.442 --> 01:39:41.044]  How can we keep hearing this crap about it'll cause an insurrection?
[01:39:41.704 --> 01:39:42.585]  In Liberia?
[01:39:42.585 --> 01:39:45.266]  You know psychology.
[01:39:45.266 --> 01:39:46.527]  I want your take.
[01:39:46.527 --> 01:39:48.688]  Why are they trying to be over-the-top?
[01:39:48.688 --> 01:39:49.829]  To break our will?
[01:39:49.829 --> 01:39:51.890]  To just exercise raw power?
[01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:54.431]  Why is it so naked when it discredits them?
[01:39:54.431 --> 01:39:56.012]  The optics destroy them.
[01:39:56.012 --> 01:39:58.673]  They don't care.
[01:39:58.673 --> 01:40:01.275]  I think that many of them are drugged, to be frank with you.
[01:40:01.275 --> 01:40:03.936]  I look at them and I watch them speak.
[01:40:03.936 --> 01:40:06.598]  I look at their faces and I watch their mouths.
[01:40:06.598 --> 01:40:08.019]  There's a disconnect from reality.
[01:40:08.019 --> 01:40:09.299]  They do look like mental patients.
[01:40:09.299 --> 01:40:10.140]  They are mentally ill.
[01:40:10.694 --> 01:40:14.336]  Well, I wrote a book in 2005 called Liberalism is a Mental Disorder.
[01:40:14.336 --> 01:40:16.317]  It wasn't written in jest.
[01:40:16.317 --> 01:40:18.098]  Because many people say, well, why would they do this?
[01:40:18.098 --> 01:40:20.799]  I say, well, take this formula and plug it in.
[01:40:20.799 --> 01:40:22.180]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:23.560]  It applies, Alex.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.061]  I think they're crazy.
[01:40:25.061 --> 01:40:25.902]  They're drugged.
[01:40:25.902 --> 01:40:26.842]  They're on medication.
[01:40:26.842 --> 01:40:30.824]  They're like on antidepressants and they don't know what the hell they're talking about.
[01:40:30.824 --> 01:40:31.805]  They're like robots.
[01:40:31.805 --> 01:40:32.445]  They're robotic.
[01:40:33.499 --> 01:40:35.259]  Let's go back a few weeks.
[01:40:35.259 --> 01:40:40.381]  Remember the fence jumper at the White House that got all the way into the White House, how they lied to us about that one?
[01:40:40.381 --> 01:40:41.681]  Yes.
[01:40:41.681 --> 01:40:42.881]  What was that, Alex?
[01:40:42.881 --> 01:40:46.782]  I'm sure you covered it in detail.
[01:40:46.782 --> 01:40:49.723]  How is that related to what we're talking about, if at all, Alex?
[01:40:49.723 --> 01:40:50.263]  What was that?
[01:40:50.263 --> 01:40:52.464]  What's your take on it?
[01:40:52.464 --> 01:40:58.005]  I'm sorry, I think that there was an attempt by elements within this government to send the warning into the White House.
[01:41:01.638 --> 01:41:11.728]  That's what I'm getting from the military and others, is they really realize they're bringing the whole country down right now, and there is a major power struggle internally.
[01:41:11.728 --> 01:41:17.613]  Well, I don't know if that's the reason, or if some caller said, Mike, you have it backwards.
[01:41:17.613 --> 01:41:26.401]  This was a false flag event to permit the White House to demand a bigger security barrier around the White House, meaning a cordon sanitaire that's two blocks wide.
[01:41:27.082 --> 01:41:28.723]  So I kept saying, wait a minute.
[01:41:28.723 --> 01:41:35.266]  Two years ago, an unarmed black woman with a baby in the back was executed by the Secret Service and the Park Police.
[01:41:35.266 --> 01:41:36.326]  Remember that incident?
[01:41:36.326 --> 01:41:36.506]  Yeah.
[01:41:36.506 --> 01:41:44.930]  She got lost, she was driving around, she wasn't anywhere near the White House, and they whacked her in the car with a fusillade of bullets with a baby in the back?
[01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:48.752]  Not only were they not indicted, they were given commendations for their bravery.
[01:41:48.752 --> 01:41:53.394]  How come she was executed and the fence jumper wasn't even attacked by a police dog?
[01:41:53.394 --> 01:41:54.054]  What's that about?
[01:41:54.054 --> 01:41:54.975]  It does look staged.
[01:41:55.825 --> 01:41:57.530]  Okay, so it's staged one way or the other.
[01:41:57.530 --> 01:41:58.231]  Take your pick, right?
[01:41:59.207 --> 01:42:06.969]  Staged to send a message saying, hey, excuse me, or to tell us he needs a bigger cordon sanitaire.
[01:42:06.969 --> 01:42:11.630]  Sort of like, let us say, Uruguay or Paraguay with tanks on the White House lawn, maybe.
[01:42:11.630 --> 01:42:12.511]  I made you digress.
[01:42:12.511 --> 01:42:15.531]  Get back into Ebola and how serious you think it is.
[01:42:15.531 --> 01:42:19.012]  And how could they try to get away with this?
[01:42:19.012 --> 01:42:20.793]  Because either way, they've ordered a stand down.
[01:42:20.793 --> 01:42:25.014]  They've ordered a stand down on default medical procedures, CDC law, policy.
[01:42:25.014 --> 01:42:25.574]  What's happening?
[01:42:27.961 --> 01:42:31.964]  Okay, well, your question implies that they want it to spread.
[01:42:31.964 --> 01:42:34.445]  But I don't think that's the reason.
[01:42:34.445 --> 01:42:42.331]  I believe it goes back to the doxies and the agenda of the radical left, which is open borders, open borders, open borders.
[01:42:42.331 --> 01:42:43.832]  It's a religion to them, Alex.
[01:42:43.832 --> 01:42:48.375]  And as you well know, religious fanatics will keep repeating the doxies of their religion
[01:42:49.232 --> 01:42:51.113]  No matter what's going on around them.
[01:42:51.113 --> 01:42:52.694]  So the doxy is keep the borders open.
[01:42:52.694 --> 01:42:53.554]  Keep the borders open.
[01:42:53.554 --> 01:42:54.275]  Good for America.
[01:42:54.275 --> 01:42:55.195]  Good for the economy.
[01:42:55.195 --> 01:42:56.436]  Keep the borders open.
[01:42:56.436 --> 01:43:06.402]  The minute they would close flights or suspend flights from Liberia and other places... That would reaffirm common sense and then that would be the beginning of the end of their religion.
[01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:07.590]  That's right.
[01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:11.752]  Then the religion would have to say, wait a minute, if you're closing that, why don't you close the border to Mexico?
[01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:16.495]  So they can't afford to reverse any agenda item.
[01:43:16.495 --> 01:43:18.136]  That's part of their strategy.
[01:43:18.136 --> 01:43:19.937]  Never ever relent.
[01:43:19.937 --> 01:43:21.557]  Not for one second.
[01:43:21.557 --> 01:43:22.918]  Even if people are dying around.
[01:43:22.918 --> 01:43:23.478]  I agree with you.
[01:43:23.478 --> 01:43:26.540]  That's why the CDC said, we can't close the border.
[01:43:27.632 --> 01:43:30.395]  The CDC chief should be arrested.
[01:43:30.395 --> 01:43:31.717]  See, he gets me enraged.
[01:43:31.717 --> 01:43:34.560]  I know who put him in power and I know why he was put in power.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.783]  It was to prevent quarantine during the AIDS epidemic.
[01:43:37.783 --> 01:43:42.568]  They put friendly people in every public health department across the United States.
[01:43:42.568 --> 01:43:44.751]  You look around, you'll see what I'm talking about.
[01:43:45.754 --> 01:43:49.837]  And that was to prevent quarantine during the early days of the AIDS epidemic.
[01:43:49.837 --> 01:43:53.439]  And they've never ever changed their protocols on any disease.
[01:43:53.439 --> 01:44:01.805]  And now we see we have Ebola coming in, which is far more devastating than AIDS in terms of it's, it kills quicker, okay?
[01:44:01.805 --> 01:44:03.186]  Let's be clear.
[01:44:03.186 --> 01:44:05.728]  And yet there's no nothing to be put in place here.
[01:44:05.728 --> 01:44:10.971]  And Obama gives speeches that everything's in charge, we know what we're doing, we've got medical care, nonsense.
[01:44:10.971 --> 01:44:12.312]  But this is just the beginning.
[01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:13.433]  Alec, they sent 3,000 to 5,000 troops to Africa?
[01:44:15.956 --> 01:44:20.300]  Now, why would they knowingly put our men and women at risk?
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.722]  And the military brass said it won't even do anything.
[01:44:22.722 --> 01:44:26.505]  It's like sponges to go soak up Ebola.
[01:44:26.505 --> 01:44:28.066]  Take a look at the military brass.
[01:44:28.066 --> 01:44:31.008]  He purged all those in the military who might have stood up to him.
[01:44:31.008 --> 01:44:33.650]  So now you've got yes men who look like ushers in a movie theater.
[01:44:34.995 --> 01:44:36.116]  I mean, don't they?
[01:44:36.116 --> 01:44:36.736]  They do!
[01:44:36.736 --> 01:44:43.899]  And what I love most is this clown Panetta who decimated the military, was one of the worst hatchet men in the history of the U.S.
[01:44:43.899 --> 01:44:52.163]  military, the worst man for national security ever, now is putting out a book making believe that he's opposing Obama in some way?
[01:44:52.163 --> 01:44:54.004]  And by the way, Alex, this is cute.
[01:44:54.004 --> 01:44:57.306]  Every bookstore has like a thousand copies of his book and twenty of mine.
[01:44:58.186 --> 01:45:00.947]  My book was cleaned out the first day yesterday.
[01:45:00.947 --> 01:45:03.368]  His books are still sitting there in stacks.
[01:45:03.368 --> 01:45:06.469]  And yet everywhere you turn, there's Panetta on O'Reilly.
[01:45:06.469 --> 01:45:08.289]  There's Panetta at USA Today.
[01:45:08.289 --> 01:45:08.989]  Where's Savage?
[01:45:08.989 --> 01:45:09.930]  Never heard of him.
[01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:10.550]  Who's he?
[01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:17.732]  Well, that's because they don't want real folk heroes or real independent journalists or real independent firebrands to rally the people out of this.
[01:45:17.732 --> 01:45:18.472]  So they block.
[01:45:18.472 --> 01:45:21.493]  I mean, that's the seal of anybody who's really good, is they block them.
[01:45:21.713 --> 01:45:26.596]  Notice, Piers Morgan was on Fox for 10 minutes today, throwing Obama under the bus.
[01:45:26.596 --> 01:45:34.179]  What does that signify that even the red coat worshipper of Obama is now leaving the sinking ship?
[01:45:34.179 --> 01:45:47.606]  What does it tell you that the idiots at Fox would rather have a man who was thrown off television because of poor ratings than someone who can tell the truth about Ebola, ED-68, the decimation of our military, the plans for another civil war to seize our guns?
[01:45:47.606 --> 01:45:48.527]  What does it tell you?
[01:45:48.527 --> 01:45:50.348]  It's all the government media complex, Alex.
[01:45:50.908 --> 01:45:52.569]  We're both voices in the wilderness here.
[01:45:52.569 --> 01:45:55.512]  It doesn't mean we're not going to win, by the way.
[01:45:55.512 --> 01:45:57.353]  Oh yeah, because our audiences, that's another thing.
[01:45:57.353 --> 01:46:00.796]  We talk about Fox, average show about 2.5 million listeners.
[01:46:00.796 --> 01:46:03.398]  MSNBC now, average show about 300,000.
[01:46:03.398 --> 01:46:04.659]  CNN, average show about 300,000.
[01:46:04.659 --> 01:46:06.141]  That's joke level.
[01:46:06.141 --> 01:46:11.465]  I mean, one of your big affiliates in like New York City or something's got hundreds of thousands an hour.
[01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:12.946]  Some of our big affiliates have 60,000, 70,000 an hour.
[01:46:14.287 --> 01:46:18.590]  Rated, shown, known, you know, instant ratings on their radios.
[01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:19.371]  We know.
[01:46:19.371 --> 01:46:20.372]  I've got 3 million a day.
[01:46:20.372 --> 01:46:22.433]  You've got 6, 7, 8 million a day.
[01:46:22.433 --> 01:46:25.655]  I get 10, 15 million YouTube views a week.
[01:46:25.655 --> 01:46:29.538]  But still, it's like a facade that there's the big mainstream media.
[01:46:29.538 --> 01:46:31.119]  They've got all the answers.
[01:46:31.119 --> 01:46:34.142]  They're the big man behind the curtain, the wonderful Oz.
[01:46:35.481 --> 01:46:38.543]  Well, we understand the powers that be and what's involved here.
[01:46:38.543 --> 01:46:44.948]  You know, we're bucking the system with the salmon swimming upstream to spawn the truth, to use a crude analogy.
[01:46:44.948 --> 01:46:49.892]  And let's just hope that when we finally do spawn, we don't die in the tide.
[01:46:50.692 --> 01:46:52.213]  Exactly, that'll be eaten by Kodiak.
[01:46:52.213 --> 01:46:55.834]  Now, shift gears back to what you just said, because that's the part of the book I'm getting to.
[01:46:55.834 --> 01:47:03.077]  The hot war, the hot civil war, to brand the patriots as the terrorists, to get the shooting war going, to take the guns.
[01:47:03.077 --> 01:47:03.638]  Get into that.
[01:47:03.638 --> 01:47:08.119]  I mean, I know it's in the book, but break down your real fear of where they may want to take us.
[01:47:08.119 --> 01:47:09.640]  Well, I think you just said it, Alex.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.061]  Here's the thing.
[01:47:11.061 --> 01:47:12.821]  How do you stop them is the question.
[01:47:12.821 --> 01:47:16.383]  What is the point of a person reading a book like Stop the Coming Civil War?
[01:47:17.156 --> 01:47:23.538]  I keep saying, and you probably disagree with me entirely, the election coming up in November is key to the salvation of the nation.
[01:47:23.538 --> 01:47:25.518]  Let me explain... No, I agree with you!
[01:47:25.518 --> 01:47:31.240]  Okay, because many people say, well, wait a minute, you're saying let the Republicans take back the Senate and what?
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.020]  You're going to have Boehner now in charge?
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:33.420]  Yes.
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:34.301]  Let me explain why.
[01:47:34.301 --> 01:47:36.001]  Here's my theory.
[01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:43.043]  The Democrats Socialist Islamist Party, which is what I call Democrats now, DSI, Democrats Socialist Islamist Party USA,
[01:47:44.505 --> 01:47:44.945]  It's a cult!
[01:47:44.945 --> 01:47:46.346]  We have a chance in the Republicans!
[01:48:06.431 --> 01:48:13.361]  Sealing the borders, rebuilding the military, recreating national security, getting rid of the devils that were put into every agency in the country.
[01:48:13.361 --> 01:48:16.225]  And we're going to lobby them through town hall meetings.
[01:48:16.225 --> 01:48:18.429]  And we're going to reach them, Alex, because they're reachable.
[01:48:18.429 --> 01:48:19.370]  They're going to be reachable.
[01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:21.052]  We're going to make them reachable.
[01:48:21.052 --> 01:48:22.234]  That's my theory, Alex.
[01:48:22.995 --> 01:48:30.258]  Well, certainly once the Democrats aren't in control of the Justice Department, they can't be blackmailing or harassing people anymore.
[01:48:30.258 --> 01:48:41.123]  So we can give the libertarian movement, the constitutional movement, a chance, which is why you see Democrats and Republicans at the top organized together against the real Tea Party.
[01:48:41.123 --> 01:48:45.405]  Not that it's perfect, but that it's one of our only shots non-violently.
[01:48:45.405 --> 01:48:46.045]  That's right.
[01:48:46.045 --> 01:48:48.326]  It's the only shot we have non-violently.
[01:48:48.326 --> 01:48:49.507]  That's correct.
[01:48:49.507 --> 01:48:52.128]  That's all we've got is this election in November.
[01:48:52.748 --> 01:48:58.075]  So when World Left Daily headlined the article, 30 Days to Save America, I was quite impressed because they actually broke it down.
[01:48:58.075 --> 01:49:00.999]  That is what I'm saying, it stopped the coming Civil War.
[01:49:00.999 --> 01:49:06.526]  So if people talk to someone in their family, you know, in every family there's a liberal and a conservative and a libertarian, right?
[01:49:07.935 --> 01:49:18.202]  Get that one person in the family to swing their vote over to the R side, explain why, and just talk about Ebola, just talk about national security, talk about the purging of the generals.
[01:49:18.202 --> 01:49:23.226]  But here's a shocking fact that is on page, I think, you know, you're not going to believe me.
[01:49:23.226 --> 01:49:28.049]  Do you know how many people have been killed who are ready to testify on Benghazi?
[01:49:28.049 --> 01:49:29.410]  How many?
[01:49:29.410 --> 01:49:30.431]  Fifteen.
[01:49:30.431 --> 01:49:31.571]  Wow.
[01:49:31.571 --> 01:49:32.632]  Fifteen.
[01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:34.313]  I don't know how I dug this one up.
[01:49:34.313 --> 01:49:35.714]  I'm almost afraid to read it on the air.
[01:49:36.977 --> 01:49:40.331]  You know, this Marxist-Leninist culture that we're talking about.
[01:49:40.331 --> 01:49:41.495]  It's on page 71.
[01:49:41.495 --> 01:49:42.579]  Can I read you the paragraph?
[01:49:42.579 --> 01:49:42.760]  Go ahead.
[01:49:45.313 --> 01:49:46.894]  On January 2014, the U.S.
[01:49:46.894 --> 01:49:51.777]  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released its bipartisan report on the Benghazi terrorist attacks.
[01:49:51.777 --> 01:49:56.380]  It contained information so shocking, I can't believe it hasn't been the focus of an investigation.
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:08.088]  The report said that as many as 15 people supporting the investigation, or otherwise helpful to the United States, have been killed in Benghazi since the September 11, 2011 attacks, reference number 30.
[01:50:08.088 --> 01:50:11.950]  Fifteen people who helped us in Benghazi have been killed since then.
[01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:13.752]  So, how could that be?
[01:50:14.710 --> 01:50:22.216]  Are we not to believe that their identities were not leaked into the hands of jihadists overseas because they helped us?
[01:50:22.216 --> 01:50:28.320]  Could it not be that the purging of our own seas and military commanders may go well beyond what happened in Benghazi?
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:33.023]  Now, I believe that there's still a contingent in the US military that wants to see President Obama ousted.
[01:50:33.023 --> 01:50:34.705]  You believe that too, don't you?
[01:50:34.705 --> 01:50:34.925]  Yes.
[01:50:36.752 --> 01:50:38.713]  Well, he's continuing his purge of the U.S.
[01:50:38.713 --> 01:50:39.893]  military.
[01:50:39.893 --> 01:50:42.374]  And I want to ask something, Alex, of your listeners.
[01:50:42.374 --> 01:50:42.894]  Hold it there!
[01:50:42.894 --> 01:50:43.814]  This is a key question.
[01:50:43.814 --> 01:50:47.656]  We're going to come back in the final segment with Michael Savage, straight ahead.
[01:50:47.656 --> 01:50:48.476]  I know he's a busy guy.
[01:50:48.476 --> 01:50:50.877]  If he wants to do 10 or 15 more minutes with us, he's welcome.
[01:50:50.877 --> 01:50:51.897]  He's probably got to go.
[01:50:51.897 --> 01:50:54.138]  Final six-minute segment with Michael Savage.

[01:53:01.976 --> 01:53:07.504]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[01:53:07.504 --> 01:53:09.888]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[01:53:10.876 --> 01:53:12.697]  I'm telling you to take cover!
[01:53:12.697 --> 01:53:17.000]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.101]  Do you even have a plan B?
[01:53:19.101 --> 01:53:22.383]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[01:53:22.383 --> 01:53:23.644]  Children left with no homes.
[01:53:23.644 --> 01:53:25.465]  And no one's coming to help them.
[01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:30.588]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to MyPatriotsApply.com.

[01:53:45.136 --> 01:53:47.377]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:53:47.377 --> 01:53:51.019]  And speak to one of our preparedness advisors today.
[01:53:51.019 --> 01:53:53.861]  Or visit us at mypatriotsupply.com.
[01:53:53.861 --> 01:53:57.143]  Remember, before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[01:54:04.386 --> 01:54:10.470]  Final segment with Michael Savage, open phones and a ton of breaking news in the third hour coming up before we end this transmission.
[01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:13.792]  We'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:54:13.792 --> 01:54:24.800]  Front page of InfoWars.com, Ebola with the Obama symbol, the rising sun of tyranny, and it says anti-gun, anti-sovereignty, anti-liberty.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:25.900]  Tyranny is a disease.
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:34.066]  So that's a great way to basically equate Obama with the disease Ebola to help wake up the people of this country and the rest of the world.
[01:54:35.226 --> 01:54:52.433]  Also don't forget you can learn what the system doesn't want you to know about immunity through real nascent iodine from the crystal form and also with DNA force from Infowarslife.com I'm not going to belabor it but the stuff in DNA force is literally the equivalent of like just one serving 500
[01:54:53.593 --> 01:54:55.534]  ... cartons of blueberries.
[01:54:55.534 --> 01:55:02.498]  The CoQ10, the PPQ, all the stuff that's in it's patented, and it's the next level of vitamin C. It's beyond that.
[01:55:02.498 --> 01:55:07.701]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:55:07.701 --> 01:55:09.262]  Michael Savage, we've got five minutes left.
[01:55:09.262 --> 01:55:10.242]  Thank you for the time.
[01:55:10.242 --> 01:55:11.123]  You've got the floor.
[01:55:11.123 --> 01:55:13.144]  You said you have a question for the military.
[01:55:14.039 --> 01:55:17.662]  Yes, I have a question for the military.
[01:55:17.662 --> 01:55:22.725]  Do any of the leaders in the military understand what he's done to this country?
[01:55:22.725 --> 01:55:26.567]  Do they understand what Hegel, Bagel, has done to the military?
[01:55:26.567 --> 01:55:29.589]  Do they understand that there's no real war against ISIS?
[01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:36.914]  How many times have we seen that clown, who looks like an usher, come out from the Defense Department and tell us that today we destroyed two trucks?
[01:55:36.914 --> 01:55:43.619]  So let's say it cost us $35 million and these incredible pilots to blow up two Toyota trucks with three ragheads in it?
[01:55:44.539 --> 01:55:55.464]  Why are they not blowing up any of the Abrams tanks that were stolen from the Iraqi military when those cowards in the Iraqi military threw down their weapons and abandoned their bases?
[01:55:55.464 --> 01:55:58.186]  They took our Abrams tanks, remember ISIS did?
[01:55:58.186 --> 01:56:00.987]  Have you yet seen one Abrams tank blown up?
[01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:01.948]  No.
[01:56:01.948 --> 01:56:02.508]  Why?
[01:56:02.508 --> 01:56:06.370]  Because this entire war against ISIS is a sham.
[01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:17.299]  It's a pretext for invading Syria, taking down Assad, and leading to the wholesale slaughter of Christians and other Alawites in Syria!
[01:56:17.299 --> 01:56:20.322]  We're about to see another Holocaust occur.
[01:56:20.322 --> 01:56:23.024]  Why is this allowed to go on?
[01:56:23.024 --> 01:56:24.806]  How can the West permit this?
[01:56:24.806 --> 01:56:26.987]  Because there is no West anymore.
[01:56:26.987 --> 01:56:27.968]  There is no West.
[01:56:27.968 --> 01:56:30.911]  The leadership has been compromised, taken over.
[01:56:30.911 --> 01:56:33.713]  I'm actually begging those in the military who know what's going on,
[01:56:34.690 --> 01:56:40.073]  To speak out long before they're retired and suddenly grow a pair of, you know what.
[01:56:40.073 --> 01:56:50.079]  I love all these retired generals who are sudden, what do you say, regular guests on Fox and CNN, telling us all of the bad things that happened when they were generals.
[01:56:50.079 --> 01:56:54.182]  The trick is to speak out while you are a general, not after you're, you know, retired.
[01:56:54.182 --> 01:56:54.722]  This is it.
[01:56:54.722 --> 01:56:56.023]  We have no time left.
[01:56:56.023 --> 01:56:58.264]  We're not surviving two more years of Ebola.
[01:56:58.264 --> 01:56:58.965]  It's impossible.
[01:56:59.685 --> 01:57:02.407]  And I say that from a statistical point of view.
[01:57:02.407 --> 01:57:04.489]  Look at what he's done in these six years.
[01:57:04.489 --> 01:57:07.692]  Now follow the arc to eight years.
[01:57:07.692 --> 01:57:09.053]  It's metastasizing.
[01:57:09.053 --> 01:57:10.854]  It's geometrically progressing.
[01:57:10.854 --> 01:57:12.636]  He's accelerating.
[01:57:12.636 --> 01:57:13.116]  It is.
[01:57:13.116 --> 01:57:19.281]  It's not going to be just two more years of this mild socialist, Leninist, slow movement.
[01:57:19.281 --> 01:57:20.842]  It's going to escalate and ratchet up.
[01:57:20.842 --> 01:57:23.224]  He wants an insurrection.
[01:57:23.224 --> 01:57:25.806]  He wants a pretext.
[01:57:25.806 --> 01:57:27.088]  He wants his Kristallnacht.
[01:57:27.748 --> 01:57:29.349]  He wants to take the guns.
[01:57:29.349 --> 01:57:30.909]  He wants to arrest people.
[01:57:30.909 --> 01:57:33.711]  He wants to detain people for their own safety.
[01:57:33.711 --> 01:57:38.072]  He wants to do all the things that we've feared at our worst.
[01:57:38.072 --> 01:57:46.176]  And I'm terrified that he might use Ebola as a pretext, rather than being impeached for this, for bringing it in, letting it come in.
[01:57:47.079 --> 01:57:49.381]  He's liable to use it to gain even more power.
[01:57:49.381 --> 01:57:51.443]  That's my worst fear, Alex.
[01:57:51.443 --> 01:57:53.285]  It's why I wrote Stop the Coming Civil War.
[01:57:53.285 --> 01:57:58.290]  He's been signing executive orders for open martial law.
[01:57:58.290 --> 01:58:03.094]  Can he get away with it, though, if they let Ebola spread, and then use that to grab power?
[01:58:03.094 --> 01:58:03.675]  Sure he can.
[01:58:03.675 --> 01:58:04.496]  Who's going to stop him?
[01:58:04.496 --> 01:58:05.417]  John Boehner?
[01:58:05.417 --> 01:58:07.679]  The New York Times?
[01:58:07.679 --> 01:58:08.620]  That's what I'm worried about.
[01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:11.683]  It is the yes-man attitude that's allowing this evil to take over.
[01:58:14.318 --> 01:58:16.665]  I don't know, I think the West is paralyzed.
[01:58:16.665 --> 01:58:17.006]  Drugged.
[01:58:17.987 --> 01:58:19.408]  I think it's just drug to death.
[01:58:19.408 --> 01:58:21.889]  I look around, I see drugs everywhere I see.
[01:58:21.889 --> 01:58:23.910]  I look at the Congress, they look like robots.
[01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:24.490]  Robotic.
[01:58:24.490 --> 01:58:25.010]  You're right.
[01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:27.671]  MichaelSavage.com, Stop the Coming Civil War.
[01:58:27.671 --> 01:58:29.832]  The book's selling out everywhere.
[01:58:29.832 --> 01:58:31.493]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:58:31.493 --> 01:58:34.254]  Michael and I and many others are just trying to wake people up.
[01:58:34.254 --> 01:58:36.355]  Michael, thanks for your time.
[01:58:36.355 --> 01:58:38.136]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:58:38.136 --> 01:58:39.777]  We'll be back, folks.
[01:58:39.777 --> 01:58:41.217]  Third Hour, your phone calls.
[01:58:41.217 --> 01:58:42.038]  A lot more.
[01:58:42.038 --> 01:58:42.518]  This is GCN.
[01:58:42.518 --> 01:58:42.598]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:42.598 --> 01:58:43.378]  Stay with us.
[01:58:49.699 --> 01:58:55.844]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forklift situation?
[01:58:55.844 --> 01:58:59.126]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:58:59.126 --> 01:59:00.868]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:59:00.868 --> 01:59:07.272]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:59:07.272 --> 01:59:13.157]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:59:13.317 --> 01:59:17.278]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:59:17.278 --> 01:59:20.359]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:59:20.359 --> 01:59:28.621]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:59:28.621 --> 01:59:30.722]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:59:30.722 --> 01:59:31.762]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:59:32.142 --> 01:59:41.087]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[01:59:41.087 --> 01:59:43.729]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:52.494]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[01:59:52.494 --> 01:59:54.875]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.875 --> 01:59:57.657]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.444 --> 02:00:06.745]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.745 --> 02:00:08.506]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.506 --> 02:00:10.267]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.267 --> 02:00:11.867]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.867 --> 02:00:13.408]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.408 --> 02:00:17.591]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.591 --> 02:00:21.653]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.493 --> 02:00:27.196]  Alright, folks, we've got callers that have been holding since Michael Savage was on with us.
[02:00:27.196 --> 02:00:28.818]  I'm going to go to you on the Ebola subject.
[02:00:28.818 --> 02:00:31.540]  I'm going to open the phones up on any topic, any issue.
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:37.685]  We'll be interspersing breaking news and other economic news I haven't gotten to and some Second Amendment news in this hour.
[02:00:37.685 --> 02:00:40.367]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:00:40.367 --> 02:00:46.533]  The phones are loaded, but when you hear a caller hang up, that's your chance to get in and on the air.
[02:00:47.745 --> 02:00:50.027]  Now I said earlier I was just taking calls on Ebola.
[02:00:50.027 --> 02:00:51.868]  A lot of these callers have been holding to talk about that.
[02:00:51.868 --> 02:00:52.428]  We'll get to those.
[02:00:52.428 --> 02:00:54.429]  Now you can talk about anything you want.
[02:00:54.429 --> 02:01:00.493]  But Oliver, Ed, John, Joseph, and so many others, we're going to go to all of you.
[02:01:00.493 --> 02:01:08.139]  Now I told Ed to get on hold because he called in not about Ebola when I said it was only Ebola calls, but about getting Liberty back on track.
[02:01:08.139 --> 02:01:12.481]  So I'm going to go back to him now to make his point, then we'll go to Oliver, John, Joseph, and others.
[02:01:12.481 --> 02:01:13.002]  Go ahead, Ed.
[02:01:14.581 --> 02:01:16.602]  Thank you for holding me.
[02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:19.364]  I didn't talk about Ebola because I don't get to watch the show.
[02:01:19.364 --> 02:01:19.924]  It's OK, brother.
[02:01:19.924 --> 02:01:20.625]  You're on air.
[02:01:20.625 --> 02:01:21.265]  It's awesome.
[02:01:21.265 --> 02:01:21.885]  You're on air.
[02:01:21.885 --> 02:01:23.446]  Go ahead.
[02:01:23.446 --> 02:01:24.287]  All right.
[02:01:24.287 --> 02:01:35.193]  On Ebola, I believe wholeheartedly that it is a false flag because they keep leaving all their most absolute basic protocols, you know, wide, wide open.
[02:01:35.193 --> 02:01:38.795]  You know, let's just let them in here.
[02:01:38.795 --> 02:01:42.757]  And yeah, it's just it's not going to be good.
[02:01:42.757 --> 02:01:42.937]  But
[02:01:43.590 --> 02:01:49.936]  I do believe that they've got it with a, what's the word, a higher survivability rate.
[02:01:49.936 --> 02:01:59.986]  If you look at Africa, it would appear, based off the number they got it and died, that it's actually better than a 90% survivability rate.
[02:01:59.986 --> 02:02:04.090]  That's fine, Ed, but back to your point about getting Liberty back on track.
[02:02:04.090 --> 02:02:04.410]  Go ahead.
[02:02:04.410 --> 02:02:05.551]  What were your four points?
[02:02:09.093 --> 02:02:11.854]  Federalize the Fed, actually federalize it.
[02:02:11.854 --> 02:02:17.096]  We need to privatize the Board of Education, because I believe that education is most basic.
[02:02:17.096 --> 02:02:21.098]  Without education, we can't see through the current... I get privatizing it.
[02:02:21.098 --> 02:02:26.320]  The problem is the globalists are already waiting to privatize it themselves as the answer to what they did to education.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:27.220]  But go ahead.
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:29.041]  Oh, that's just not good.
[02:02:29.041 --> 02:02:33.263]  Okay, and then obviously we have to abolish the NDAA and Obamacare.
[02:02:33.883 --> 02:02:34.783]  Yes.
[02:02:34.783 --> 02:02:36.504]  Obamacare is meant to kill our economy.
[02:02:36.504 --> 02:02:40.046]  That's why it's all in the news today that our economy is in absolute shambles.
[02:02:40.046 --> 02:02:41.027]  That was the plan.
[02:02:41.027 --> 02:02:41.987]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:41.987 --> 02:02:43.088]  Oliver, in Texas.
[02:02:43.088 --> 02:02:44.988]  You're on the air.
[02:02:44.988 --> 02:02:46.109]  Oh my God.
[02:02:46.109 --> 02:02:46.949]  Alex, how are you?
[02:02:46.949 --> 02:02:47.490]  I'm good, brother.
[02:02:47.490 --> 02:02:49.411]  Go ahead.
[02:02:49.411 --> 02:02:53.212]  First of all, I've been listening to you for over 10 years.
[02:02:53.212 --> 02:02:55.033]  I'm from New York originally.
[02:02:55.033 --> 02:02:59.656]  I was there for 9-11, which was not a good place to be.
[02:02:59.656 --> 02:03:02.377]  And you do great work.
[02:03:03.939 --> 02:03:05.119]  Thank you, sir.
[02:03:05.119 --> 02:03:05.580]  Yes, I am.
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:05.820]  Go ahead.
[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:08.420]  What's your take on Ebola?
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:11.622]  I'm in Fort Worth now, okay?
[02:03:11.622 --> 02:03:16.883]  So I'm close to where it is, you know?
[02:03:16.883 --> 02:03:20.584]  I'm not right next door to it, but I'm close.
[02:03:20.584 --> 02:03:31.088]  And any other politician or president would take this as an opportunity with all the money that they have
[02:03:32.421 --> 02:03:34.582]  Which is not their money, it's our money.
[02:03:34.582 --> 02:03:40.623]  But they would bankroll everything to make them look good.
[02:03:40.623 --> 02:03:43.064]  He's doing exactly the opposite.
[02:03:43.064 --> 02:03:45.025]  And letting his whole party turn against him?
[02:03:45.025 --> 02:03:47.485]  Yeah, what's behind that?
[02:03:47.485 --> 02:03:50.126]  He has a job, bring down the country.
[02:03:50.126 --> 02:03:55.828]  Exactly, it's like, you know, he has a 19% or 11% approval rate.
[02:03:55.828 --> 02:03:57.768]  It's like, you could boost it to 50% immediately.
[02:04:00.345 --> 02:04:00.905]  Immediately.
[02:04:00.905 --> 02:04:02.126]  So what do you think is behind it?
[02:04:02.126 --> 02:04:06.107]  What do you think is behind it?
[02:04:06.107 --> 02:04:09.568]  It's kind of scary because there is no sense behind it.
[02:04:09.568 --> 02:04:09.929]  Exactly.
[02:04:09.929 --> 02:04:24.154]  Obviously he wants it to spread because a normal, and I hate politicians as much as you do probably, a normal politician would take this opportunity to make himself look good.
[02:04:24.154 --> 02:04:26.175]  But he's not doing that.
[02:04:26.175 --> 02:04:28.516]  He's doing the exact opposite.
[02:04:28.516 --> 02:04:29.276]  All he has to do
[02:04:30.313 --> 02:04:32.675]  Is do crazy stuff.
[02:04:32.675 --> 02:04:40.000]  Exactly and that tells you they are out of control and it shows they got something even bigger planned that's so horrible this won't even matter.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.682]  They are, they're an enemy trying to bring the country down.
[02:04:42.682 --> 02:04:50.788]  I just keep explaining that because they think the media is so controlled that they'll pose as saviors on the crises they created to consolidate power.
[02:04:50.788 --> 02:04:51.748]  That's how they operate.
[02:04:51.748 --> 02:04:54.890]  Only their operations are allowed to operate.
[02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:58.093]  We're gonna come back and talk to Joseph, John, Alan, Gina and others.
[02:04:59.810 --> 02:05:03.473]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.473 --> 02:05:07.756]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:07.756 --> 02:05:09.537]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:09.537 --> 02:05:17.402]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:17.402 --> 02:05:18.543]  But for how long?
[02:05:18.543 --> 02:05:25.188]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:25.188 --> 02:05:27.990]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:05:29.366 --> 02:05:30.447]  DNA Force.
[02:05:30.447 --> 02:05:33.708]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:33.708 --> 02:05:34.869]  DNA Force.
[02:05:34.869 --> 02:05:43.033]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:43.033 --> 02:05:48.116]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:05:48.116 --> 02:05:49.157]  DNA Force.
[02:05:49.157 --> 02:05:51.158]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:06:01.757 --> 02:06:05.400]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:06.220]  Security alert.
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:07.461]  Security alert.
[02:06:07.461 --> 02:06:09.462]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:06:09.462 --> 02:06:10.343]  Analysis.
[02:06:10.343 --> 02:06:11.063]  InfoWars.
[02:06:11.063 --> 02:06:13.165]  Building independent media operations.
[02:06:13.165 --> 02:06:18.048]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:18.048 --> 02:06:19.089]  Crime Directive.
[02:06:19.089 --> 02:06:20.630]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:20.630 --> 02:06:23.472]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:23.472 --> 02:06:26.734]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:06:26.734 --> 02:06:28.896]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:29.036 --> 02:06:30.536]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:06:30.536 --> 02:06:32.717]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:32.717 --> 02:06:35.318]  They are never going to stop.
[02:06:35.318 --> 02:06:39.359]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:06:39.359 --> 02:06:42.940]  Block free iPhone apps at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:46.321]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:06:46.321 --> 02:06:47.301]  Imperative.
[02:06:47.301 --> 02:06:49.342]  Deploy criminal limit TV.
[02:06:49.342 --> 02:06:54.003]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:06:54.003 --> 02:06:56.144]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[02:06:59.130 --> 02:07:01.372]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:07:01.372 --> 02:07:09.441]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:09.441 --> 02:07:16.629]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:07:16.949 --> 02:07:21.550]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:07:21.550 --> 02:07:32.192]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:07:32.192 --> 02:07:38.673]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:07:38.673 --> 02:07:41.233]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:07:41.233 --> 02:07:44.874]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[02:07:45.054 --> 02:07:47.017]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[02:08:33.689 --> 02:08:36.973]  Monday through Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:36.973 --> 02:08:37.793]  From 11 a.m.
[02:08:37.793 --> 02:08:38.514]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:38.514 --> 02:08:40.757]  Central.
[02:08:40.757 --> 02:08:43.439]  Back 7 o'clock Central with InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:08:47.506 --> 02:09:09.891]  We are taking your phone calls, going through one call after another, and coming up at the bottom of the hour, our intrepid reporter went down to the state capitol and has the head of the state health department saying there's no risk, close quote, that Ebola could spread from patient zero, even though someone in a hospital brought in out of Liberia, or was it Sierra Leone in Madrid, Spain has spread it.
[02:09:11.789 --> 02:09:13.770]  That is simply amazing.
[02:09:13.770 --> 02:09:15.811]  We're going to be taking your phone calls.
[02:09:15.811 --> 02:09:17.552]  Then there's some of this news I'm going to get to.
[02:09:17.552 --> 02:09:18.392]  Obama!
[02:09:18.392 --> 02:09:23.054]  There's a sense the world is spinning so fast nobody's able to control it.
[02:09:23.054 --> 02:09:27.956]  In this election, Obama's party benches him.
[02:09:27.956 --> 02:09:28.697]  That's right.
[02:09:28.697 --> 02:09:31.058]  Blame the last puppet for their whole agenda.
[02:09:31.058 --> 02:09:33.779]  No, they're the ones behind it.
[02:09:33.779 --> 02:09:36.100]  Loyal Panetta defends his criticism of Obama.
[02:09:38.055 --> 02:09:40.699]  Jimmy Carter, President Obama blew it on ISIL.
[02:09:40.699 --> 02:09:42.782]  See, now they're trying to say, oh, it was a mistake.
[02:09:42.782 --> 02:09:43.703]  We should have dealt with them.
[02:09:43.703 --> 02:09:44.845]  No, you armed them.
[02:09:44.845 --> 02:09:50.793]  See, the whitewash is ongoing because this woke up the military.
[02:09:50.793 --> 02:09:53.918]  Confidence in Obama on economy hits new low in a new poll.
[02:09:55.609 --> 02:09:57.091]  Hillary's Hispanic problem.
[02:09:57.091 --> 02:10:04.078]  Immigration activists recruit Gutierrez to challenge Clinton 2016 as she declares she's pro-gun and wants to control the borders.
[02:10:04.078 --> 02:10:05.800]  That is all total theater.
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:07.842]  Totally staged with Gutierrez.
[02:10:07.842 --> 02:10:09.764]  I mean, just total theater.
[02:10:09.764 --> 02:10:11.526]  I liked Hillary, liberal!
[02:10:11.526 --> 02:10:14.770]  You better vote for her, Alex, you darn commie!
[02:10:16.837 --> 02:10:18.858]  What, are you against women?
[02:10:18.858 --> 02:10:23.161]  You're like that sexist, kissing a woman is sexual assault.
[02:10:23.161 --> 02:10:29.746]  I was in the news today that the famous photo of the sailor kissing the nurse getting off the ship after victory against Japan.
[02:10:29.746 --> 02:10:33.568]  They're now saying that's rape.
[02:10:33.568 --> 02:10:36.970]  They teach on the colleges, sex period by male is rape.
[02:10:36.970 --> 02:10:40.733]  Men are inherently evil.
[02:10:40.733 --> 02:10:43.515]  No, humans have been inherently predators, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:45.487 --> 02:10:50.071]  And women can be predators as well, but sex between a man and a woman is a beautiful thing when it's consenting.
[02:10:50.071 --> 02:10:53.354]  And I know that sounds like a conspiracy theory, but you're right.
[02:10:53.354 --> 02:10:59.919]  Two plus two equals five, and Rachel Maddow, she sets all the parameters.
[02:10:59.919 --> 02:11:02.621]  She says it's bad, so it is.
[02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:05.804]  We're not in a cult or anything here where a man kissing a woman's evil.
[02:11:08.151 --> 02:11:11.592]  We're a man taking a woman who wants it is evil.
[02:11:11.592 --> 02:11:13.713]  I mean, let me tell you, that's what women are looking for.
[02:11:13.713 --> 02:11:23.335]  There's all these guys raised in a liberal trendiness system, and maybe they got a girlfriend that keeps them like a pet, that pats them on the head like their pet cat or dog, but they always get rid of them.
[02:11:23.335 --> 02:11:25.596]  Let me tell you men what women want.
[02:11:25.596 --> 02:11:32.118]  They want a confident, smart, informed, involved man, even if they don't know it, who will conquer them.
[02:11:33.635 --> 02:11:34.815]  That's what women want.
[02:11:34.815 --> 02:11:36.696]  They want to be conquered.
[02:11:36.696 --> 02:11:37.936]  Not in a bad way.
[02:11:37.936 --> 02:11:40.257]  Truth is, when you conquer them, they conquer you.
[02:11:40.257 --> 02:11:42.597]  The species isn't complete without the man and the woman.
[02:11:42.597 --> 02:11:45.058]  I absolutely love women, want them to succeed.
[02:11:45.058 --> 02:11:47.799]  I'm not in competition with women.
[02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:48.879]  I know what women want, though.
[02:11:48.879 --> 02:11:58.181]  Even if this culture hasn't taught women what they want, so they're at historic, all-time, unsatisfied, unhappy.
[02:11:58.181 --> 02:11:59.242]  Especially by the time they hit 45.
[02:12:00.814 --> 02:12:07.244]  They chased that whole Esquire magazine, Vanity Fair.
[02:12:07.244 --> 02:12:09.948]  Oh, what's the big women's magazine that they follow every word of it?
[02:12:11.530 --> 02:12:12.230]  What's the big one?
[02:12:12.230 --> 02:12:15.751]  The big woman's Cosmo, Cosmopolitan.
[02:12:15.751 --> 02:12:27.475]  That is all CIA written, declassified to wreck you and wreck your life and make you alone and the state is your man.
[02:12:27.475 --> 02:12:32.416]  And don't worry, he isn't going to lovingly conquer you and take care of you and take care of him.
[02:12:32.416 --> 02:12:39.058]  He's going to slap you upside the head and knock your teeth out and pimp you out good and then euthanize you when he's done with you, baby.
[02:12:40.598 --> 02:12:42.820]  You're gonna say, baby, I did everything.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:46.825]  I brought you 100% of the money and you won't even give me food to eat.
[02:12:46.825 --> 02:12:51.550]  He's gonna backhand you and say, shut up.
[02:12:51.550 --> 02:12:53.672]  Gonna raise those taxes on you.
[02:12:53.672 --> 02:12:58.978]  Gonna give you those deadly Gardasil shots and you're gonna thank him.
[02:12:58.978 --> 02:12:59.679]  You want a man?
[02:12:59.679 --> 02:13:00.600]  You got a man.
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:01.381]  It's called the state.
[02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:03.631]  People don't believe me.
[02:13:03.631 --> 02:13:04.651]  Pull up that video.
[02:13:04.651 --> 02:13:06.153]  I mean, this is in mainstream news.
[02:13:06.153 --> 02:13:08.275]  And they're actually with straight face.
[02:13:08.275 --> 02:13:09.035]  I meant to cover this.
[02:13:09.035 --> 02:13:10.276]  It's in my email.
[02:13:10.276 --> 02:13:11.517]  I never gave it to one of the writers.
[02:13:11.517 --> 02:13:12.078]  We go in there.
[02:13:12.078 --> 02:13:18.023]  It's from Sunday or maybe Saturday when I had it sent to my email from one of my friends that had it.
[02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:23.428]  Yoga studios all over Austin aren't allowed
[02:13:24.329 --> 02:13:30.691]  They tell people, don't dress like Indian stuff, and we probably can't sell Indian stuff in our gift shops.
[02:13:30.691 --> 02:13:35.832]  And we can't have India parties.
[02:13:35.832 --> 02:13:41.554]  That's like saying if somebody's into karate and they want to wear a karate outfit, you're anti-Japanese.
[02:13:41.554 --> 02:13:42.794]  It's that mentally ill.
[02:13:42.794 --> 02:13:48.996]  Where I heard the two guys a few years ago at Martin Springs, three guys, they go, let's go get Chinese food!
[02:13:49.895 --> 02:13:51.816]  Two were Hispanic, one was white.
[02:13:51.816 --> 02:13:54.116]  And one of the Hispanic ones goes, man, don't say that.
[02:13:54.116 --> 02:13:54.836]  It's racist.
[02:13:54.836 --> 02:13:56.117]  And they weren't joking.
[02:13:56.117 --> 02:13:59.037]  The words, words are racist.
[02:13:59.037 --> 02:14:00.858]  Talking is racist.
[02:14:00.858 --> 02:14:05.319]  See, you eat the school lunch the government says.
[02:14:05.319 --> 02:14:06.619]  You follow what they do.
[02:14:06.619 --> 02:14:08.260]  You only say what they say.
[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:12.441]  Whatever the new propaganda is, then you're safe.
[02:14:12.441 --> 02:14:15.942]  But you don't dress like a geisha girl or a cowboy or an Indian or an Eskimo.
[02:14:17.304 --> 02:14:25.567]  Because there's one yoga studio and they mentioned in the email, someone came to the party last year at Halloween dressed as an Eskimo.
[02:14:25.567 --> 02:14:26.988]  And people thought that was racist.
[02:14:26.988 --> 02:14:27.408]  Really?
[02:14:27.408 --> 02:14:28.368]  I mean, I dress like a pirate.
[02:14:28.368 --> 02:14:31.809]  I dress like, you know, I could dress like Kim Jong-un.
[02:14:31.809 --> 02:14:33.030]  It's not against Asians.
[02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:36.071]  Thinking about going to a party this year dressed as Kim Jong-un just to have fun.
[02:14:39.246 --> 02:14:40.426]  No, no, that's anti-Asian.
[02:14:40.426 --> 02:14:48.668]  See, anything you do is to be labeled that so you can be demonized and put into guilt and do what they say.
[02:14:48.668 --> 02:14:53.810]  You ever put that article on screen about Victory Over Japan, man kissing woman banned?
[02:14:53.810 --> 02:14:54.710]  There it is.
[02:14:54.710 --> 02:15:02.152]  Yeah, yeah, feminist group calls statue a famous VJ day kiss sexual assault.
[02:15:02.152 --> 02:15:03.592]  And they don't just do that to get attention.
[02:15:03.592 --> 02:15:04.992]  You're like, oh, those are cranks or coops.
[02:15:04.992 --> 02:15:05.953]  No, no, no.
[02:15:05.953 --> 02:15:07.433]  That's what's taught, folks.
[02:15:08.775 --> 02:15:13.437]  It's being announced all over the country that they're not going to call it boys and girls room.
[02:15:13.437 --> 02:15:17.658]  See, you're not allowed to have your identity as a male or as a female.
[02:15:17.658 --> 02:15:20.239]  You're not allowed to say, you know what?
[02:15:20.239 --> 02:15:21.920]  I like 50s dresses.
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:23.400]  I like fast cars.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:24.741]  I like John Wayne.
[02:15:24.741 --> 02:15:26.221]  I like Marilyn Monroe.
[02:15:26.221 --> 02:15:27.882]  You can like whatever you want.
[02:15:27.882 --> 02:15:30.963]  Quite frankly, I don't even care.
[02:15:30.963 --> 02:15:34.524]  But don't tell me to adopt whatever you want.
[02:15:34.524 --> 02:15:36.725]  You're not going to run my life.
[02:15:38.732 --> 02:15:41.354]  Nebraska school bans terms boys and girls.
[02:15:41.354 --> 02:15:43.876]  Train teachers to avoid gender expressions.
[02:15:43.876 --> 02:15:48.719]  Gender, see, oh in 1984 you gotta watch the face.
[02:15:48.719 --> 02:15:51.281]  Men shouldn't stick their chest out or put their hands on their hips.
[02:15:51.281 --> 02:15:52.502]  No, no, no.
[02:15:52.502 --> 02:15:54.744]  Oh, it's all, you don't learn how to read and write.
[02:15:54.744 --> 02:15:57.906]  You learn how to keep your face right.
[02:15:57.906 --> 02:15:59.247]  See, now it's down to how you look.
[02:15:59.247 --> 02:16:01.448]  See, remember Seattle two years ago?
[02:16:01.448 --> 02:16:03.630]  Cities are banned from having brown bags.
[02:16:03.630 --> 02:16:04.771]  They put down brown people.
[02:16:07.267 --> 02:16:10.289]  Brown bags have just always been the inexpensive paper.
[02:16:10.289 --> 02:16:15.813]  Never had any, butcher paper, never had anything to do with brown people.
[02:16:15.813 --> 02:16:18.135]  I've got brown skin.
[02:16:18.135 --> 02:16:20.517]  Thank God I've got enough Native American to get a good tan.
[02:16:20.517 --> 02:16:21.978]  I think it looks good.
[02:16:21.978 --> 02:16:26.121]  The point is, my skin ain't brown, folks, because I don't like brown people.
[02:16:26.121 --> 02:16:29.123]  It's brown because I like the sun.
[02:16:29.123 --> 02:16:32.105]  And it has nothing to do, and I got a brown truck.
[02:16:32.105 --> 02:16:34.447]  My dad had a Ford Bronco that was brown when I was a kid.
[02:16:34.447 --> 02:16:35.208]  Boy, I love that truck.
[02:16:35.987 --> 02:16:38.468]  Was it my dad bought that brown car because he was a racist?
[02:16:38.468 --> 02:16:54.734]  See, this is all about the real collectivism, the real discrimination, the globalists taking over our society, bringing in Ebola, totally open borders, everything just going haywire, all the economy shutting down, just tons of news on that.
[02:16:54.734 --> 02:16:58.375]  I don't have to tell you, you're seeing it happen.
[02:16:58.375 --> 02:17:04.277]  And they're saying at the yoga studios all over Austin, I'm going to give this email today to the guys having to write a story about it.
[02:17:05.848 --> 02:17:07.809]  It actually says with a straight face.
[02:17:07.809 --> 02:17:09.510]  Show that there's never a problem.
[02:17:09.510 --> 02:17:16.594]  We're just banning the 5th Annual Halloween Party Costume Party.
[02:17:17.836 --> 02:17:19.577]  Because something might be offensive.
[02:17:19.577 --> 02:17:22.839]  And then we asked around, and all over, they're banning Halloween parties.
[02:17:22.839 --> 02:17:24.580]  I mean, you see, Halloween's occultic, whatever.
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:26.341]  Dress it up like cowboys, whatever.
[02:17:26.341 --> 02:17:28.622]  The point is, is it's people's right to do it.
[02:17:28.622 --> 02:17:36.706]  Because the Democrats that have colonized Austin, out of California mainly, that's who they are, nothing against California except for your people.
[02:17:36.706 --> 02:17:38.987]  They've ruined their state, don't know why they're here.
[02:17:38.987 --> 02:17:44.110]  They literally get up and denounce nothing.
[02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:46.912]  Because of last year, they said, okay, it'll be an India-style party.
[02:17:47.773 --> 02:17:50.894]  Like a toga party, where you dress up like Greeks, you know, for colleges.
[02:17:50.894 --> 02:17:52.354]  That's where it comes from.
[02:17:52.354 --> 02:17:53.314]  No, no, that's against the Greeks.
[02:17:53.314 --> 02:17:54.434]  Can't have that.
[02:17:54.434 --> 02:17:58.535]  Can't have a fiesta party at your fraternity, because that's racist.
[02:17:58.535 --> 02:18:03.416]  Really, I thought enchiladas were good, and it was fun to drink tequila and wear some Reros.
[02:18:03.416 --> 02:18:07.257]  By the way, the Hispanic clubs are banning fiestas.
[02:18:07.257 --> 02:18:09.358]  Fiesta just means party, folks.
[02:18:09.358 --> 02:18:14.959]  This is the cult Jim Jones on PCP level garbage.
[02:18:17.887 --> 02:18:22.773]  I guess I'm racist if I like to go out to a Mexican food restaurant and like mariachi bands.
[02:18:22.773 --> 02:18:25.115]  I like mariachi bands, folks, at a Mexican food restaurant.
[02:18:25.115 --> 02:18:27.718]  They come over and I have them play Roo Coo Coo.
[02:18:27.718 --> 02:18:28.219]  And you know why?
[02:18:28.219 --> 02:18:29.841]  It's because I'm racist.
[02:18:29.841 --> 02:18:36.248]  Just like I'm racist against high mountain, organic, volcanically grown Chiapas coffee.
[02:18:36.248 --> 02:18:37.649]  It's because I'm racist.
[02:18:37.649 --> 02:18:39.652]  By the way, you notice coffee's brown, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:18:42.327 --> 02:19:01.581]  So, that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen, is that the banks are robbing us, they're tax-exempt, that's discrimination, the country's collapsing, we're all being discriminated against by the New World Order, by Obamacare, veterans are on secret death panel lists, it's all admitted now, but my gosh, ladies and gentlemen, do you know what?
[02:19:01.581 --> 02:19:07.726]  Last year, people got offended by Halloween costumes, this year, at the Yoga Studio, it is only going to be
[02:19:10.384 --> 02:19:10.924]  I just can't believe this.
[02:19:10.924 --> 02:19:12.566]  I've got the long email.
[02:19:12.566 --> 02:19:15.488]  This year it'll only be India style, because, you know, yoga's from India.
[02:19:15.488 --> 02:19:16.249]  Oh, great, it'll be fun.
[02:19:16.249 --> 02:19:17.409]  We'll have dancing.
[02:19:17.409 --> 02:19:19.251]  Sorry, can't have that.
[02:19:19.251 --> 02:19:21.733]  And then now there's talk of Oktoberfest being bad.
[02:19:21.733 --> 02:19:28.458]  It puts down Germans, so German towns can't have tourists come in and have fun and drink beer and eat Wienerschnitzel and dance.
[02:19:28.458 --> 02:19:32.181]  I went out to Fredericksburg this weekend.
[02:19:32.181 --> 02:19:35.444]  My gosh, folks, I even wore a green German hat and had fun, danced around.
[02:19:35.444 --> 02:19:37.425]  And you know why I did it, of course.
[02:19:37.425 --> 02:19:39.427]  It was because I'm against Germans.
[02:19:41.755 --> 02:19:44.456]  I'm against those Kraut bastards.
[02:19:44.456 --> 02:19:45.997]  By the way, I'm about half Kraut.
[02:19:45.997 --> 02:19:50.498]  The reason I said Kraut bastards is we need to get unpolitically correct to counter all this.
[02:19:50.498 --> 02:19:55.580]  That's the antidote to this garbage of this mind-control cult garbage.
[02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:57.861]  We're gonna keep costume parties.
[02:19:57.861 --> 02:19:59.122]  We're gonna keep Oktoberfest.
[02:20:00.618 --> 02:20:02.059]  It's already too late.
[02:20:02.059 --> 02:20:04.721]  Criminals have kicked in your door and are now in your home.
[02:20:04.721 --> 02:20:06.902]  Before this happens, homeowners have a choice.
[02:20:06.902 --> 02:20:11.125]  One, do nothing and hope you aren't one of the 1.4 million families attacked each year.
[02:20:11.125 --> 02:20:12.906]  Or two, refuse to be a victim.
[02:20:12.906 --> 02:20:16.168]  And for as low as $59, reinforce your doors with Door Devils.
[02:20:16.168 --> 02:20:21.791]  Door Devils simply attach to existing door frames and have proven to stop the biggest bad guys from kicking in doors.
[02:20:21.791 --> 02:20:25.174]  Read our police testimonials of real-life events at doordevil.com.
[02:20:25.174 --> 02:20:26.675]  Alarms don't stop kick-ins.
[02:20:26.675 --> 02:20:27.295]  We do.
[02:20:27.295 --> 02:20:28.376]  Doordevil.com.
[02:20:29.381 --> 02:20:30.502]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:30.502 --> 02:20:34.985]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:34.985 --> 02:20:40.708]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:40.708 --> 02:20:42.870]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:44.291]  No word about IRAs.
[02:20:44.291 --> 02:20:46.952]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.952 --> 02:20:51.916]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:20:51.916 --> 02:20:52.216]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:52.216 --> 02:20:53.537]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:02.863]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[02:21:02.863 --> 02:21:07.387]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:21:07.387 --> 02:21:13.912]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:21:13.912 --> 02:21:17.916]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:21:17.916 --> 02:21:18.917]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:21:19.557 --> 02:21:32.366]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:21:32.366 --> 02:21:40.471]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[02:21:40.471 --> 02:21:44.133]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[02:21:44.133 --> 02:21:49.497]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively
[02:21:49.497 --> 02:21:53.463]  exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:21:58.470 --> 02:22:03.795]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[02:22:03.795 --> 02:22:05.796]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[02:22:05.796 --> 02:22:09.579]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[02:22:09.579 --> 02:22:13.763]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[02:22:13.763 --> 02:22:20.489]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[02:22:20.489 --> 02:22:24.352]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.

[02:22:27.932 --> 02:22:30.653]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[02:22:30.653 --> 02:22:31.434]  No joke.
[02:22:31.434 --> 02:22:34.135]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[02:22:34.135 --> 02:22:35.476]  And if House Bill H.R.
[02:22:35.476 --> 02:22:41.238]  5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[02:22:41.238 --> 02:22:44.040]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:46.541]  Go now to InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[02:22:50.463 --> 02:22:51.583]  You should too.
[02:22:51.583 --> 02:22:54.545]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L.
[02:22:54.545 --> 02:22:55.985]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:22:55.985 --> 02:22:57.106]  Just won't quit.
[02:22:58.510 --> 02:23:03.874]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[02:23:03.874 --> 02:23:07.737]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[02:23:07.737 --> 02:23:12.920]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:14.802]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[02:23:14.802 --> 02:23:17.484]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[02:23:18.268 --> 02:23:21.809]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:23:21.809 --> 02:23:27.792]  After consuming One World Away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:23:27.792 --> 02:23:34.795]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:23:34.795 --> 02:23:37.196]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[02:23:37.876 --> 02:23:41.681]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[02:23:41.681 --> 02:23:42.622]  Wow!
[02:23:42.622 --> 02:23:43.103]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:43.103 --> 02:23:43.303]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:43.303 --> 02:23:44.805]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:23:44.805 --> 02:23:45.586]  That's One World.
[02:23:45.586 --> 02:23:45.826]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:24:04.009 --> 02:24:06.431]  Okay, I went off on that political correctness jag.
[02:24:06.431 --> 02:24:09.153]  Listen, they know it's over the top.
[02:24:09.153 --> 02:24:10.354]  It's about mind control.
[02:24:10.354 --> 02:24:16.099]  It's about a bunch of control freaks telling you how to talk, telling you how to think, telling you what to say.
[02:24:16.099 --> 02:24:24.545]  And now businesses, colleges, high schools are banning any type of costume party saying it's offensive.
[02:24:24.545 --> 02:24:27.427]  That's banning free speech.
[02:24:27.427 --> 02:24:27.948]  It's a cult.
[02:24:31.502 --> 02:24:35.703]  And in Europe they're banning free speech saying if it hurts someone else's feelings.
[02:24:35.703 --> 02:24:39.584]  Michael Savage can't even go to England because he criticizes radical Islam.
[02:24:39.584 --> 02:24:45.306]  Whether you agree with that or disagree, there should be free speech.
[02:24:45.306 --> 02:24:49.147]  Joseph in New Mexico, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[02:24:49.147 --> 02:24:51.448]  Hey Alex, good afternoon.
[02:24:51.448 --> 02:24:52.048]  Welcome.
[02:24:52.048 --> 02:24:56.729]  First of all, I want to comment on you and the interview.
[02:24:56.729 --> 02:24:59.470]  Two heavy weights of freedom.
[02:25:00.222 --> 02:25:02.424]  Comparing notes, you know, great radio.
[02:25:02.424 --> 02:25:05.065]  Awesome, awesome job.
[02:25:05.065 --> 02:25:12.891]  And also, you know, I know that everybody likes to tell you, God bless you for what you're doing and, you know, and everything like that.
[02:25:12.891 --> 02:25:17.434]  But you know what, I'm going to thank your mom and your dad for having you.
[02:25:17.434 --> 02:25:26.740]  Thank, you know, thank them both because, you know, this world would be empty without an Alex Jones and a Michael Savage and, you know, just
[02:25:28.082 --> 02:25:28.663]  Thank him.
[02:25:28.663 --> 02:25:29.243]  Thank him for me.
[02:25:44.574 --> 02:25:57.344]  I mean, I went to the doctor the other day to have my Achilles looked at, and in the clinic next to it they had a bunch of autistic kids, and I personally felt assaulted by their pain and their minds being wiped, and what their parents were going through.
[02:25:57.344 --> 02:26:08.053]  I wasn't annoyed by all of their little chirpings and things I thought were cute, actually, but I imagine the 500 millionth time I wouldn't be of the poor parents.
[02:26:08.053 --> 02:26:10.335]  It made me so angry the globalists know what they're doing.
[02:26:11.255 --> 02:26:14.096]  And it's just, it's just, it's not that I'm some goody two-shoe.
[02:26:14.096 --> 02:26:16.076]  I have self-preservation at heart.
[02:26:16.076 --> 02:26:20.537]  I have an instinct that if somebody walks up and punches me in the nose, I'm going to fight back.
[02:26:20.537 --> 02:26:22.158]  The globalists are attacking us.
[02:26:22.158 --> 02:26:23.898]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:23.898 --> 02:26:30.580]  Well, you know what, you know, you know, the powers, the powers that should, that should not be, you know, you know, they honestly, you know, they don't care.
[02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:37.921]  But the reason that I'm calling you today, Alex, is that, you know, I was listening to the George Morey coast to coast.
[02:26:37.921 --> 02:26:39.322]  This was Monday night.
[02:26:39.322 --> 02:26:40.062]  Another great guy.
[02:26:41.619 --> 02:26:42.560]  Uh, excuse me?
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.606]  Oh yeah.
[02:26:46.606 --> 02:26:47.507]  Exactly.
[02:26:47.507 --> 02:26:53.155]  But anyway, he had, uh, he had, uh, uh, he had quoted, uh, uh, let me see.
[02:26:53.155 --> 02:26:54.076]  I wrote it down here.
[02:26:54.076 --> 02:26:55.318]  Uh, Israeli source.
[02:26:56.115 --> 02:26:59.516]  That said that this guy Duncan from Texas had died.
[02:26:59.516 --> 02:27:01.377]  Yeah, that Israeli source might have been right.
[02:27:01.377 --> 02:27:02.698]  They probably covered it up.
[02:27:02.698 --> 02:27:06.979]  I told my reporters not to go with that, even though it was a real Israeli newspaper.
[02:27:06.979 --> 02:27:12.721]  We killed that story yesterday morning, and then sure enough, they say he died today.
[02:27:12.721 --> 02:27:13.301]  You know what?
[02:27:13.301 --> 02:27:14.682]  I bet he died yesterday.
[02:27:14.682 --> 02:27:15.862]  I bet they are covering up.
[02:27:15.862 --> 02:27:17.703]  You're exactly right.
[02:27:17.703 --> 02:27:19.184]  And well, you know what?
[02:27:19.184 --> 02:27:22.385]  Mr. Norrie, he couldn't confirm it or anything like that.
[02:27:24.027 --> 02:27:34.677]  I found it strange that yesterday, I don't know if it was his brother or somebody, they said that he had a high fever but he was on dialysis and everything like that.
[02:27:34.677 --> 02:27:35.898]  Everything seemed to be okay.
[02:27:36.764 --> 02:27:41.146]  But you know what, I don't trust these people, you know.
[02:27:41.146 --> 02:27:43.407]  We don't even know if Ebola is really spreading.
[02:27:43.407 --> 02:27:45.408]  It could be a simulant.
[02:27:45.408 --> 02:27:47.048]  But we know it's in Africa.
[02:27:47.048 --> 02:27:50.670]  Why would they bring people in who have it to spread it in hospitals?
[02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:54.191]  It's now spread in Spain, out of somebody they brought in the country.
[02:27:54.191 --> 02:27:56.572]  Exactly what I said a month and a half ago would happen.
[02:27:56.572 --> 02:27:58.533]  And the national media said I was what?
[02:27:58.533 --> 02:27:59.313]  A fear monger.
[02:27:59.313 --> 02:28:03.175]  Because when you say 2 plus 2 equals 4, you are a fear monger.
[02:28:03.775 --> 02:28:10.297]  When you say raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt, 2 plus 2 equals 5,000, you are normal.
[02:28:10.297 --> 02:28:15.778]  When you try to ban costume parties, you're not an authoritarian control freak dirtbag.
[02:28:15.778 --> 02:28:18.778]  Beyond Nazi Germany, you're loving and liberal.
[02:28:18.778 --> 02:28:22.319]  We've got to do everything that Rachel Maddow says.
[02:28:22.319 --> 02:28:24.120]  I mean, what a joke!
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:28.901]  A bunch of redcoats like Piers Morgan and Mr. Maddow lecturing us?
[02:28:28.901 --> 02:28:29.501]  Shut up!
[02:28:29.861 --> 02:28:30.701]  Shut up!
[02:28:30.701 --> 02:28:35.442]  Stop telling me what to do, you authoritarian, anti-liberal piece of garbage!
[02:28:35.442 --> 02:28:37.503]  You people are not liberals!
[02:28:37.503 --> 02:28:40.304]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal!
[02:28:40.304 --> 02:28:42.904]  George Washington was a conservative!
[02:28:42.904 --> 02:28:44.365]  That's what they look like!
[02:28:44.365 --> 02:28:46.465]  Not what you say you are!
[02:28:46.465 --> 02:28:49.506]  You are fascist scum!
[02:28:49.506 --> 02:28:52.727]  Excuse me, anything else, caller?
[02:28:52.727 --> 02:28:56.208]  Well, you know, I like what you say there, you know, and...
[02:28:58.287 --> 02:29:05.176]  Uh, you know, when you're, uh, you know, you're saying that, you know, you're talking about these people, you know, that we have... They're authoritarians preying on us!
[02:29:05.176 --> 02:29:06.377]  They have bad will!
[02:29:06.377 --> 02:29:07.839]  They're flaming crooks!
[02:29:07.839 --> 02:29:09.221]  They're flaming liars!
[02:29:09.221 --> 02:29:10.623]  They're flaming scum!
[02:29:10.623 --> 02:29:12.004]  They have bad intent!
[02:29:12.004 --> 02:29:13.005]  Bad will!
[02:29:13.005 --> 02:29:13.846]  Bad!
[02:29:13.846 --> 02:29:15.168]  Like Jeffrey Dahmer!
[02:29:15.168 --> 02:29:16.510]  They're bad!
[02:29:16.510 --> 02:29:17.211]  They're bad!
[02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:18.840]  They're bad!
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:19.360]  That's it!
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:20.341]  They're evil!
[02:29:20.341 --> 02:29:23.521]  That's why they do stuff that doesn't make sense, because they want to crap all over everything!
[02:29:23.521 --> 02:29:25.022]  They want to crap over everything!
[02:29:25.022 --> 02:29:29.723]  They're a bunch of scum, deviant, mentally ill, devil-worshipping turds!
[02:29:29.723 --> 02:29:30.923]  Excuse me.
[02:29:30.923 --> 02:29:31.743]  I want to apologize.
[02:29:31.743 --> 02:29:34.204]  I have a lot of great affiliates and family shows.
[02:29:34.204 --> 02:29:41.426]  I don't normally get like this, but they're letting Ebola in, they're aborting 54 million babies, they do whatever they want, and I'm sick of it!
[02:29:42.904 --> 02:29:43.264]  You know what?
[02:29:43.264 --> 02:29:44.765]  It's a sin for me to go wild and do that.
[02:29:44.765 --> 02:29:45.346]  I apologize.
[02:29:45.346 --> 02:29:48.328]  But it's a lot bigger sin to not stop the abortion.
[02:29:48.328 --> 02:29:52.671]  So get the beam out of your eye before you get the speck out of mine!
[02:29:52.671 --> 02:29:54.032]  We'll be right back!
[02:29:54.032 --> 02:29:54.813]  Stay with us!

[02:30:10.985 --> 02:30:20.714]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:30:20.914 --> 02:30:31.279]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:30:31.279 --> 02:30:35.941]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[02:30:35.941 --> 02:30:38.182]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[02:30:38.382 --> 02:30:40.923]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[02:30:40.923 --> 02:30:46.606]  Instead, OxyPowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:30:46.606 --> 02:30:51.948]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[02:31:01.403 --> 02:31:05.064]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:05.064 --> 02:31:09.346]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:09.346 --> 02:31:11.127]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:11.127 --> 02:31:18.990]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:20.130]  But for how long?

[02:32:00.954 --> 02:32:02.215]  Another major health threat.
[02:32:02.215 --> 02:32:07.198]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:32:07.198 --> 02:32:09.859]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:32:09.859 --> 02:32:16.904]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:32:16.904 --> 02:32:19.885]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:32:19.885 --> 02:32:22.927]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:32:22.927 --> 02:32:24.868]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:32:24.868 --> 02:32:27.690]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:33.512]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:32:33.512 --> 02:32:37.013]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:32:37.013 --> 02:32:40.114]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:32:40.114 --> 02:32:47.437]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:33:16.863 --> 02:33:18.283]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:44.850 --> 02:33:46.452]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:46.452 --> 02:33:48.213]  We're taking your phone calls here today.
[02:33:48.213 --> 02:33:54.760]  I'm trying to keep my anger from boiling over during the breaks, because this is teleprompter free.
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:55.440]  This is not a game.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:56.722]  It's not a joke.
[02:33:56.722 --> 02:34:02.247]  We're going to talk to John, Rosie, Alan, Rick, Gina, and others here in just a moment.
[02:34:02.247 --> 02:34:07.792]  Let me recap some of the top Ebola news stories right now as they develop.
[02:34:08.453 --> 02:34:08.973]  I don't know.
[02:34:28.984 --> 02:34:29.824]  Remain still.
[02:34:29.824 --> 02:34:30.465]  Infectious.
[02:34:30.465 --> 02:34:32.825]  Family members kept under quarantine.
[02:34:32.825 --> 02:34:35.326]  Officials monitoring 48 people.
[02:34:35.326 --> 02:34:38.827]  Protesters clash with police over Ebola dog.
[02:34:38.827 --> 02:34:40.327]  Uganda protests.
[02:34:40.327 --> 02:34:41.827]  Don't shake hands.
[02:34:41.827 --> 02:34:45.288]  In Liberia, no soap, no bleach, no gloves.
[02:34:45.288 --> 02:34:47.829]  Those countries are basically collapsing.
[02:34:47.829 --> 02:34:51.610]  Thermal scanners at schools and airports are non-effective.
[02:34:51.610 --> 02:34:55.191]  We have a story on that that just went up on Infowars.com by Kit Daniels.
[02:34:55.811 --> 02:35:03.913]  Feds announce airport fever screening for Ebola, which can be beaten with ibuprofen.
[02:35:03.913 --> 02:35:15.596]  The new fever screenings by the Obama administration are little more than security theater designed to make federal officials look like saviors when in fact they're violating their own protocols preventing, which prevent a virus from spreading.
[02:35:15.596 --> 02:35:18.217]  That is shutting down the flights and controlling the borders.
[02:35:18.217 --> 02:35:22.318]  So it's all them trying to respond and keep their religion of open borders going.
[02:35:23.098 --> 02:35:27.741]  Continuing, the Coast Guard sector issues new steps on Ebola virus.
[02:35:27.741 --> 02:35:28.221]  A U.S.
[02:35:28.221 --> 02:35:38.607]  Coast Guard sector says it will contact ships that have recently been to Ebola-affected countries to ask whether passengers have symptoms of the virus before they are allowed into port.
[02:35:38.607 --> 02:35:46.111]  The sector, which includes parts of New York and Connecticut, issued the Maritime Community in Long Island sound on Monday.
[02:35:46.111 --> 02:35:48.372]  Ebola doesn't describe protocols being put into place.
[02:35:50.182 --> 02:35:54.424]  Connecticut Health Commissioner granted quarantine power, AP.
[02:35:54.424 --> 02:35:59.286]  Doctors say Spanish woman, the nurse, touched face with Ebola glove and that's how she got it.
[02:35:59.286 --> 02:36:00.647]  Why'd you bring it in the country?
[02:36:00.647 --> 02:36:03.088]  Spain struggles to address concern over Ebola.
[02:36:03.088 --> 02:36:04.649]  Why'd you bring it into the country to begin with?
[02:36:06.223 --> 02:36:07.964]  That's the new open border policy.
[02:36:07.964 --> 02:36:11.805]  CDC not taking extra Ebola precautions at SeaTac Airport.
[02:36:11.805 --> 02:36:13.966]  No, just set up random highway checkpoints.
[02:36:13.966 --> 02:36:16.747]  First Ebola patient, as I mentioned, is dead.
[02:36:16.747 --> 02:36:18.507]  That is just some of the news on that front.
[02:36:18.507 --> 02:36:24.289]  CDC says in the Hill newspaper, airborne Ebola, possible but unlikely.
[02:36:24.289 --> 02:36:29.311]  New York hospitals prep for Ebola in drill staff pretending to be patients.
[02:36:29.311 --> 02:36:31.272]  Intercity hospitals complaining of symptoms.
[02:36:32.475 --> 02:36:35.056]  That is just some of the news on that front.
[02:36:35.056 --> 02:36:43.320]  Double reverse on Ebola mission, World Net Daily, and yet another Obama administration reversal, adding to the confusion surrounding the mission of U.S.
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:44.100]  troops in West Africa.
[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:49.763]  Defense Department official General David Rodriguez misspoke when he told reporters Tuesday that U.S.
[02:36:49.763 --> 02:36:51.964]  troops would be in direct contact with Ebola patients.
[02:36:53.370 --> 02:37:00.616]  Well of course they'll be in direct contact with people that have Ebola, not just patients, because this country is just spreading everywhere and incubates for 21 days.
[02:37:00.616 --> 02:37:03.238]  You don't know who has it for 21 days.
[02:37:03.238 --> 02:37:06.340]  Ebola scare draws firefighters to O'Hare.
[02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:09.443]  Lots of panicking going on, but the border stays open.
[02:37:09.443 --> 02:37:15.107]  They'll like have bomb teams looking for boxes on the side of the road that blow out of a truck, but leave the border open.
[02:37:15.107 --> 02:37:17.689]  It's just all part of this order not a KO scenario.
[02:37:18.690 --> 02:37:22.192]  Ebola scare delays flight at Ontario International Airport.
[02:37:22.192 --> 02:37:24.053]  More hysterical behavior.
[02:37:24.053 --> 02:37:28.475]  American Airlines flight makes emergency landing over Ebola scare after passenger gets sick.
[02:37:28.475 --> 02:37:33.457]  Democratic Senator in tough race can't get straight answer about Obama's response to Ebola.
[02:37:35.054 --> 02:37:38.275]  Male Ebola survivor told use a condom.
[02:37:38.275 --> 02:37:44.017]  Sex can keep Ebola academic alive even after the World Health Organization declares a free area of the disease.
[02:37:44.017 --> 02:37:47.379]  One of the discoveries of the deadly virus on Tuesday.
[02:37:47.379 --> 02:37:49.840]  The WHO is hoping to announce later this week that Nigerian
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:54.703]  Other countries are free of Ebola after 42 days with no infections.
[02:37:54.703 --> 02:37:57.726]  The standard period of declaring an outbreak over.
[02:37:57.726 --> 02:38:00.108]  Twice the maximum 41 day incubation period.
[02:38:00.108 --> 02:38:03.871]  However, it appears the disease can last much longer in semen.
[02:38:03.871 --> 02:38:07.814]  70 days inside the testicles as an incubator.
[02:38:07.814 --> 02:38:10.296]  Testicles are designed to keep sperm alive?
[02:38:10.296 --> 02:38:12.598]  Well, turns out it's keeping the Ebola alive.
[02:38:12.598 --> 02:38:13.659]  Perfect little nursery.
[02:38:15.717 --> 02:38:27.304]  General, if Ebola reaches Central America, there will be mass migration into the United States.
[02:38:27.304 --> 02:38:28.505]  Okay, continuing here.
[02:38:30.003 --> 02:38:31.265]  Ebola outbreak.
[02:38:31.265 --> 02:38:36.110]  Spread of deadly disease across Europe is unavoidable, warns World Health Organization chief.
[02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:47.423]  Meanwhile, they have Texas Health and Human Services Executive Commissioner Kyle Janik, the audio is not that good from the state video feed, saying that there's basically no chance and no threat.
[02:38:47.423 --> 02:38:48.645]  We'll go ahead and play that clip now.
[02:38:54.648 --> 02:38:56.269]  Still, we had it this morning.
[02:38:56.269 --> 02:38:57.209]  It's a cool.
[02:38:57.209 --> 02:39:01.431]  Such a big deal was made out of the clip that I knew from the beginning, not you guys, that it was not meant to be aired.
[02:39:01.431 --> 02:39:03.392]  It's fine.
[02:39:03.392 --> 02:39:04.392]  Yeah, it's not a big deal.
[02:39:04.392 --> 02:39:04.912]  I don't need it.
[02:39:04.912 --> 02:39:05.893]  It's fine.
[02:39:05.893 --> 02:39:06.713]  Okay.
[02:39:06.713 --> 02:39:08.914]  Anyways, let's move along to calls now.
[02:39:08.914 --> 02:39:11.955]  Let's talk to Gina in California.
[02:39:11.955 --> 02:39:12.596]  Go ahead, Gina.
[02:39:12.596 --> 02:39:13.096]  You're on the air.
[02:39:14.232 --> 02:39:15.333]  Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
[02:39:15.333 --> 02:39:15.853]  I'm Gina.
[02:39:15.853 --> 02:39:20.135]  I'm a 42-year-old married mom of four from American Canyon, California.
[02:39:20.135 --> 02:39:31.221]  Before I get into what I think about the Ebola and the question I have for you, what I'd like to say about the gorgeous soldier kiss statue is it's a testimony to the good guy winning and getting the girl.
[02:39:31.221 --> 02:39:41.307]  So, as a mom and a sexy female, I would like to say that men and women do have a beautiful thing together, and we as women do want to be conquered.
[02:39:41.307 --> 02:39:43.668]  Check out the book, What a Man Really Wants, by Justin Sterling.
[02:39:44.378 --> 02:39:54.364]  Now, as a stage 3 colon cancer survivor with a 13-year-old autistic son, I do believe he was purposely infected through an MMR vaccine I traced to Merck.
[02:39:54.364 --> 02:39:58.527]  My brother is a United States Air Force, and he's a cop.
[02:39:58.527 --> 02:40:05.111]  And after training the dogs for 10 years, he went as high as he could as a kettle master, and he's now an intelligence.
[02:40:05.111 --> 02:40:12.495]  He's not technically allowed to tell me anything, but when I talk to him about how I see my friends and family ignoring the truth,
[02:40:13.988 --> 02:40:20.995]  And buying their Starbucks and going to the mall and watching, I don't care what they watch on TV, crap.
[02:40:20.995 --> 02:40:22.136]  Nothing is being done.
[02:40:22.136 --> 02:40:24.439]  9-11 was our first wake up.
[02:40:24.439 --> 02:40:26.321]  Katrina slapped us in the face.
[02:40:26.321 --> 02:40:30.145]  And now we've been listening to you, yet I can barely pay the rent.
[02:40:30.145 --> 02:40:34.229]  I don't have any money to buy your amazing stuff on the InfoWars store.
[02:40:34.229 --> 02:40:36.291]  And we can barely get an extra can of SpaghettiOs.
[02:40:36.789 --> 02:40:49.134]  So my question to you, Mr. Jones, is how, as an American mom who stays at home with my four babies against the establishment's wishes, how am I supposed to prep for my family and exist with everyone in America?
[02:40:49.134 --> 02:40:52.275]  Well, there's a poor man or woman's way to do everything.
[02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:54.556]  You can get sea salts.
[02:40:54.556 --> 02:40:55.557]  They're true sea salts.
[02:40:55.557 --> 02:40:59.038]  They're known to have iodine in them and things like that.
[02:40:59.038 --> 02:41:00.559]  It's just basic stuff is everywhere.
[02:41:01.257 --> 02:41:06.480]  The stuff we have is affordable, but it's just the supercharged best out there from the research we've done.
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:09.523]  Sunshine is there for everybody.
[02:41:09.523 --> 02:41:12.084]  Except for the winter, that's why people get so sick during the winter.
[02:41:12.084 --> 02:41:15.987]  But I hear you, and God bless you, and I appreciate your call.
[02:41:15.987 --> 02:41:17.708]  That's why they want us poor.
[02:41:17.708 --> 02:41:19.909]  That's why they want us under their control.
[02:41:19.909 --> 02:41:21.931]  That's why they want Obamacare to shut down the economy.
[02:41:21.931 --> 02:41:24.753]  That's why they want the troops on these secret death panels.
[02:41:24.753 --> 02:41:27.675]  They want us poor, domesticated, under their control.
[02:41:27.675 --> 02:41:30.717]  That's why we're trying to promote free market and wealth.
[02:41:33.021 --> 02:41:34.782]  Our political engine's being blown.
[02:41:34.782 --> 02:41:36.402]  Allen in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[02:41:36.402 --> 02:41:43.826]  Yeah, I was actually initially calling to report on the Ebola patient dying in Texas.
[02:41:43.826 --> 02:41:53.650]  We are continually being lied to, and they contradict their story, they produce confusion, and it just keeps going and going and going.
[02:41:53.650 --> 02:41:58.352]  It's obviously a PSYOP in my view, but what is the larger goal?
[02:41:59.769 --> 02:42:03.532]  Right, well how do we change this?
[02:42:03.532 --> 02:42:09.136]  They grow in leaps and bounds and we only make moves in inches and centimeters.
[02:42:09.136 --> 02:42:15.480]  It doesn't seem that anything that we the people do has an effect on the establishment.
[02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:21.545]  And I just, I feel lost sometimes.
[02:42:21.545 --> 02:42:23.306]  I'm sorry my audio is cutting out, what'd you say?
[02:42:24.233 --> 02:42:39.238]  I said they're growing leaps and bounds on a daily basis, and our progress as the people, you know, we stymie them here and there, but we don't seem to make any progress towards the American culture of freedom.
[02:42:39.238 --> 02:42:46.860]  That's because it's very hard to beat the fog of war, and the globalists write about this all the time, where they create so much confusion, such a dumbed down society.
[02:42:47.620 --> 02:42:52.442]  That then they can win because they control the government and we're all in shambles.
[02:42:52.442 --> 02:42:53.323]  And that's what they've done.
[02:42:53.323 --> 02:43:02.527]  But once people are aware of that and know that the central government is totally run by psychopathic control freaks, literal might as well be aliens here to kill us.
[02:43:02.527 --> 02:43:03.307]  I mean, they're that bad.
[02:43:03.307 --> 02:43:09.650]  I mean, they're not technically, but demons from hell possessing people, whatever you want to call it.
[02:43:09.650 --> 02:43:10.611]  It's cognitive dissonance.
[02:43:11.516 --> 02:43:14.119]  Why did dozens of women get in the car with Ted Bundy?
[02:43:14.119 --> 02:43:20.948]  Because he wore nice little grey suits and little brown loafers and he had nice clean cut haircut and he drove a yellow Volkswagen.
[02:43:21.946 --> 02:43:27.388]  And he would talk to him in a little soft NPR voice, kind of like Senator Harry Reid.
[02:43:27.388 --> 02:43:32.470]  And he'd say, hi, you want to go get a Coke or something, see a movie?
[02:43:32.470 --> 02:43:33.410]  Want to have fun?
[02:43:33.410 --> 02:43:35.391]  And then he'd go, he's a non-threatening guy.
[02:43:35.391 --> 02:43:37.732]  I'm going to get in the car with him.
[02:43:37.732 --> 02:43:43.254]  And then he'd reach over and put handcuffs on him, punch him in the nose, put a gun to their head, and say, keep quiet, you're going to be safe.
[02:43:43.254 --> 02:43:47.395]  Now, if they had knocked their head to the window, fought and bit him, he'd have thrown them out.
[02:43:47.395 --> 02:43:48.356]  He did that with a couple of women.
[02:43:49.016 --> 02:43:50.017]  The ones that fought lived.
[02:43:50.017 --> 02:43:54.002]  The others got taken to basements, tied down and tortured for months.
[02:43:54.002 --> 02:43:56.345]  He loved torturing and sucking their soul out.
[02:43:56.345 --> 02:43:57.867]  And that's what the globalists do, okay?
[02:43:57.867 --> 02:43:59.589]  They're going to suck our soul.
[02:43:59.589 --> 02:44:03.193]  And they've got us, they've almost got us chained down with Homeland Security now.
[02:44:03.193 --> 02:44:06.076]  And the real fun can start.
[02:44:06.076 --> 02:44:07.098]  And that's what it's all about.
[02:44:08.183 --> 02:44:12.045]  You're just trendy with a little short beard and curly hair and a sweater.
[02:44:12.045 --> 02:44:13.826]  Oh, hi!
[02:44:13.826 --> 02:44:16.167]  Oh, I'm non-threatening.
[02:44:16.167 --> 02:44:20.009]  Don't like the men that are big and open and have loud voices.
[02:44:20.009 --> 02:44:24.011]  No, like me, the trendy, the Obama, yeah.
[02:44:24.011 --> 02:44:25.532]  I'm gonna take real good care of you.
[02:44:25.532 --> 02:44:27.533]  I appreciate your call, Alan.
[02:44:27.533 --> 02:44:32.296]  Rick in Canada, you're on the air.
[02:44:32.296 --> 02:44:35.858]  Is this the wildly popular conspiracy theorist Alex Jones?
[02:44:36.986 --> 02:44:41.187]  I guess, I mean, I think 2 plus 2 equals 4, and that's the definition of conspiracy theory, yeah.
[02:44:41.187 --> 02:44:45.608]  I have my own views, and I have a memory, and I am bad, yes.
[02:44:45.608 --> 02:44:48.988]  In that case, I've got the right guy.
[02:44:48.988 --> 02:45:03.931]  Alex, from a third observer being up here in Canada, I've been listening to your show now for about six months, I'm quite impressed with it, and it just seems to me that basically America,
[02:45:05.131 --> 02:45:10.737]  Almost like the entire country is run like a corporation.
[02:45:10.737 --> 02:45:15.802]  And that the people are being literally managed.
[02:45:15.802 --> 02:45:21.408]  Yes, but managed towards a destructive end as a human resource.
[02:45:21.408 --> 02:45:27.194]  I think, you know, basically your guess was right once martial law is declared.
[02:45:28.501 --> 02:45:34.122]  It'll probably take close to a year and a half for it to get to the point where it is.
[02:45:34.122 --> 02:45:35.842]  It'll just be a soft martial law.
[02:45:35.842 --> 02:45:37.783]  We're already in a civil war.
[02:45:37.783 --> 02:45:49.625]  We have pundits and all their minions in the counties and cities and states and public schools and colleges saying, don't dress up like a cowboy or a native Indian, Native American at an event.
[02:45:49.625 --> 02:45:51.225]  Don't dress as a geisha girl.
[02:45:51.225 --> 02:45:53.246]  Don't have Oktoberfest.
[02:45:53.246 --> 02:45:54.266]  Don't kiss girls.
[02:45:55.259 --> 02:46:03.246]  I mean, they're a bunch of crazy control freaks, and we follow their orders, so no wonder we're in so much trouble.
[02:46:03.246 --> 02:46:11.073]  Exactly, and I mean, honestly, I don't know what yous can do, really.
[02:46:11.073 --> 02:46:15.376]  The brainwashing we're under is globally standardized.
[02:46:15.376 --> 02:46:15.636]  Okay?
[02:46:16.624 --> 02:46:19.945]  It's globally standardized, so whatever we're under, you've got your own version there.
[02:46:19.945 --> 02:46:24.526]  I mean, hell, they don't let preachers read out of the Bible stuff they say is, you know, hurtful in Canada.
[02:46:24.526 --> 02:46:25.767]  They arrest preachers up there.
[02:46:25.767 --> 02:46:38.471]  If you, uh, and I don't agree with this, because Hitler did kill a bunch of people and did target Jews, but if you go up to Canada and disagree with how people got killed in the Holocaust, when real historians disagree all over the map, it was a lot, it was millions of people, the point is you can debate it.
[02:46:38.471 --> 02:46:39.391]  They arrest you.
[02:46:40.171 --> 02:46:44.715]  I think he's absolutely right that I don't think Obama is going to leave office once martial law is declared.
[02:47:05.826 --> 02:47:16.254]  It's the blueprint to basically make the North American Union and they just keep right on progressing but they're... That's right, that's right.
[02:47:16.254 --> 02:47:18.756]  We can't have a border because it's gone.
[02:47:18.756 --> 02:47:26.322]  Except for citizens, it's an internal checkpoint on record for currency and capital controls and to not let us get out.
[02:47:26.322 --> 02:47:27.503]  It's not there anymore.
[02:47:27.503 --> 02:47:28.684]  God bless you.
[02:47:28.684 --> 02:47:29.805]  Same thing for your Canadian border.
[02:47:30.626 --> 02:47:38.328]  George Norey, God bless him, he's wanting me to come up to Canada when he does big shows up in Toronto that sell out to thousands and other stuff and I'm going to go to some of his shows and hang out because I want to go to some of them.
[02:47:38.328 --> 02:47:38.928]  He's a good friend of mine.
[02:47:38.928 --> 02:47:43.349]  But I don't think when I try to go up to Canada, one of his shows, they'll let me in.
[02:47:43.349 --> 02:47:48.430]  And Canada's a beautiful country, but man, I mean, you'd have thought Hitler had landed whenever I go up there.
[02:47:48.430 --> 02:47:51.670]  I mean, they arrest me, they throw me in a jail cell, they scream at me for 16 hours.
[02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:53.971]  I mean, it's not fun.
[02:47:55.256 --> 02:47:59.940]  And meanwhile I'm sitting there looking out the jail cell as just illegals just pour through when I'm in Canada.
[02:47:59.940 --> 02:48:02.343]  I mean, just, you know, it's a joke.
[02:48:02.343 --> 02:48:03.644]  Dean in North Carolina.
[02:48:03.644 --> 02:48:04.484]  Dean, you're on the air.
[02:48:04.484 --> 02:48:06.626]  Hi, I think we should...
[02:48:07.715 --> 02:48:10.859]  Well, if they didn't give illegals free welfare, then it would all end.
[02:48:10.859 --> 02:48:12.360]  And then the type of illegals we'd have are the ones we want.
[02:48:29.707 --> 02:48:30.027]  Yeah.
[02:48:30.027 --> 02:48:40.071]  I mean, you incentivize, have babies free, get everything free, then you incentivize the worst dregs of anywhere in the world to come here.
[02:48:40.071 --> 02:48:46.274]  Despite all the freebies, so many of these people are hardworking and want their own business that they won't take the welfare.
[02:48:46.274 --> 02:48:52.537]  So there are a lot of good people from the immigrant pools that are fleeing the hell of Latin America.
[02:48:52.537 --> 02:48:55.818]  So that's why this is a sad thing is there's actually a lot of great people coming up here.
[02:48:56.516 --> 02:49:08.096]  The problem is the Democratic Party and the Republicans, they want, you're handicapped, you want to come have five kids, you never had a job in your life, you weigh 500 pounds and wear 6X underwear.
[02:49:08.096 --> 02:49:09.319]  Literally, we want you.
[02:49:10.922 --> 02:49:12.363]  It's just incredible, isn't it?
[02:49:12.363 --> 02:49:18.027]  I just want to say one last point that I am upset because, you know, I'm only in my early 20s.
[02:49:18.027 --> 02:49:19.688]  What have I done to deserve any of this?
[02:49:19.688 --> 02:49:32.996]  And now, because of the decadent ways of those younger generations of the ones who fought in World War I and World War II and such, have let the government take control to the point where, you know, now my daughter is in danger.
[02:49:34.107 --> 02:49:35.528]  Well, they call it the greatest generation.
[02:49:35.528 --> 02:49:38.249]  My grandfathers and grandmothers are and were wonderful people.
[02:49:38.249 --> 02:49:48.494]  One of them is still alive, though she's had a really rough couple of weeks, let me tell you.
[02:49:48.494 --> 02:49:52.116]  In a lot of ways, they were better than us and more moral, because I've looked at it.
[02:49:52.116 --> 02:50:02.281]  But in other ways, they were gullible, because the greatest generation were the ones that forgot what their parents and grandparents taught them, that you don't trust the government, you don't keep your money in a bank, and you don't go into debt.
[02:50:03.038 --> 02:50:07.282]  And you only work with people that absolutely are trusted.
[02:50:07.282 --> 02:50:17.111]  I mean, in the old days, just 80 years ago, if you didn't have a good name, you didn't get a job anywhere, and nobody worked with you, people didn't blackball you, you blackballed yourself.
[02:50:17.111 --> 02:50:21.315]  You didn't pay your bills, you cheated somebody, you're not gonna work anymore in the town.
[02:50:21.315 --> 02:50:26.740]  And then the next step is you're gonna fall down and hit your head.
[02:50:26.740 --> 02:50:28.402]  And I was reading history books and stuff about
[02:50:29.224 --> 02:50:31.705]  My ancestors that are all over Texas history books.
[02:50:31.705 --> 02:50:34.285]  And I mean, somebody'd cheat them, they'd just go kill them.
[02:50:34.285 --> 02:50:40.267]  And if it wasn't, they'd be like the most trusted people in the town, totally nice, totally friendly, help everybody, loved.
[02:50:40.267 --> 02:50:42.427]  You'd cheat them, they'd just come kill you.
[02:50:42.427 --> 02:50:44.768]  And not like a wimp compared to my ancestors, the stuff they did.
[02:50:44.768 --> 02:50:47.008]  I mean, just, you know, you smart mouth them.
[02:50:47.008 --> 02:50:49.609]  Go out in the street, get your gun, let's go right now.
[02:50:49.609 --> 02:50:51.689]  I mean, you know, I mean, that's just how everybody was.
[02:50:51.689 --> 02:50:54.550]  They didn't have a bunch of wimps and fake tough people.
[02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:56.811]  You shoot your mouth off, you better be ready to back it up 100%.

[02:52:17.747 --> 02:52:20.808]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:52:20.808 --> 02:52:22.729]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:52:22.729 --> 02:52:25.611]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.

[02:54:34.346 --> 02:54:36.567]  Final segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:36.567 --> 02:54:40.769]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the news websites.
[02:54:42.315 --> 02:54:43.915]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:54:43.915 --> 02:54:44.275]  to 2 p.m.
[02:54:44.275 --> 02:54:51.417]  as you know, back weeknights, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[02:54:51.417 --> 02:55:10.700]  Please don't forget that if you check into DNA Force, it is a proprietary, nutraceutical, just one patented, certified, proven ingredient in it, costs us $12,000 per kilo, or the equivalent of $40 into each bottle just of that one ingredient of a whole bunch.
[02:55:11.698 --> 02:55:21.291]  That's why if you go to Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com and read about DNA Force, you can actually see the claims that we're able to make on record because this is a nutraceutical.
[02:55:21.291 --> 02:55:21.992]  This is proven.
[02:55:23.416 --> 02:55:26.398]  So talk about immune system, you name it, this is it.
[02:55:26.398 --> 02:55:29.440]  X2 Survival Shield, nascent proprietary iodine.

[02:55:50.638 --> 02:55:54.379]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Rhode Island.
[02:55:54.379 --> 02:55:55.019]  You're on the air.
[02:55:55.019 --> 02:55:58.239]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:55:58.239 --> 02:55:58.920]  I'm fine, brother.
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:55:59.260]  Go ahead.
[02:55:59.260 --> 02:56:15.103]  Hey, um, I live in Rhode Island, a small state, and just recently, as of, I think it was yesterday, four towns in our little state were threatened.
[02:56:15.103 --> 02:56:16.203]  The schools were, that is.
[02:56:18.018 --> 02:56:31.087]  There was letters sent to schools saying that the children were left outside, that they would either be kidnapped or beheaded, and a lot of people saying that this is an ISIS threat.
[02:56:31.087 --> 02:56:33.889]  I just was wondering if you had heard anything on your end.
[02:56:33.889 --> 02:56:34.609]  No, I haven't heard of it.
[02:56:34.609 --> 02:56:35.370]  It sounds like a prank.
[02:56:36.410 --> 02:56:41.914]  But ISIS is a real terror group being funded by our criminal government, on record, publicly.
[02:56:41.914 --> 02:56:44.276]  And they are letting them come into the country.
[02:56:44.276 --> 02:56:46.298]  And I don't think they would put the threat out first.
[02:56:46.298 --> 02:56:49.060]  The way they operate is they're just going to do it.
[02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:51.241]  And they have said over there they're going to come over here and kill us.
[02:56:51.241 --> 02:56:55.064]  And our government's greasing the skids for them, as Michael Savage said.
[02:56:55.064 --> 02:56:55.825]  It's totally fake.
[02:56:55.825 --> 02:56:56.826]  The war on terror is fake.
[02:56:59.383 --> 02:57:03.006]  The controlled right always spins it and says that I'm saying there's no radical Islamists.
[02:57:03.006 --> 02:57:04.067]  That's not what I'm saying.
[02:57:04.067 --> 02:57:05.068]  I'm saying just what I said.
[02:57:05.068 --> 02:57:07.811]  The government's funding and I'm protecting them.
[02:57:07.811 --> 02:57:08.431]  Anything else, sir?
[02:57:08.431 --> 02:57:10.433]  No, that's it.
[02:57:10.433 --> 02:57:10.913]  God bless you.
[02:57:10.913 --> 02:57:12.415]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:12.415 --> 02:57:14.036]  Joseph in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:57:14.036 --> 02:57:16.378]  Yeah, hey, can you hear me, Alex?
[02:57:16.378 --> 02:57:16.819]  Yes, I can.
[02:57:18.171 --> 02:57:19.332]  A couple of things here.
[02:57:19.332 --> 02:57:23.753]  On the Ebola, that doctor that caught the virus from C-section?
[02:57:23.753 --> 02:57:23.973]  Yes.
[02:57:23.973 --> 02:57:28.955]  Well, I happened to work in the operating room for over 20 years, and that is just totally absurd.
[02:57:28.955 --> 02:57:36.657]  And somebody needs to pay the piper on this one, because as soon as they come into pre-op, as soon as they get in that hospital, they're already checking vitals.
[02:57:37.307 --> 02:57:44.393]  So, for that to get to the operating room to do a C-section, whoever's doing the anesthesia would have a grasp on that as well.
[02:57:44.393 --> 02:57:46.274]  I mean, it's just totally disregard.
[02:57:46.274 --> 02:58:00.106]  Another thing on the Benghazi hearing, I don't know how you feel about Trey Gowdy, but I've been watching some of the hearings on C-SPAN, the way he's really getting into Hillary Clinton, and how the cover-up is, with all the underlings just totally not giving any names.
[02:58:00.945 --> 02:58:02.407]  Well, yeah, because they've been threatened.
[02:58:02.407 --> 02:58:04.791]  They even offered to put them in the witness protection program.
[02:58:04.791 --> 02:58:05.893]  There's a whole bunch of deaths.
[02:58:05.893 --> 02:58:08.878]  Looks like 15 people that could blow the whistle have ended up dying.
[02:58:10.925 --> 02:58:20.010]  It's just totally unbelievable, and what I like to see happen is an expedition of this hearing, because look at 9-11.
[02:58:20.010 --> 02:58:21.851]  How long has it been?
[02:58:21.851 --> 02:58:22.231]  14 years?
[02:58:22.231 --> 02:58:22.871]  No, I hear you.
[02:58:22.871 --> 02:58:23.392]  Great point.
[02:58:23.392 --> 02:58:24.052]  I'm out of time.
[02:58:24.052 --> 02:58:25.232]  Sorry to other callers.
[02:58:25.232 --> 02:58:28.094]  Lord will, and I'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
[02:58:28.094 --> 02:58:33.597]  Central Standard Time, with the rest of the incredible InfoWars team that did another amazing job today.
[02:58:34.497 --> 02:58:36.779]  Retransmission starts now, InfoWars.com.
[02:58:36.779 --> 02:58:39.861]  The show is re-aired on stations all across the United States.
[02:58:39.861 --> 02:58:42.362]  We have a chance to stop this and turn it around.
[02:58:42.362 --> 02:58:44.724]  The people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:44.724 --> 02:58:49.067]  By the way, the new Ebola Obama t-shirts are available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:49.067 --> 02:58:50.007]  I forgot to tell you that.
[02:58:50.007 --> 02:58:50.828]  A limited number.
[02:59:04.377 --> 02:59:05.018]  We're good to go.
[02:59:19.318 --> 02:59:23.900]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:59:23.900 --> 02:59:27.741]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:59:27.741 --> 02:59:28.981]  Other's don't.
[02:59:28.981 --> 02:59:31.122]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:59:31.122 --> 02:59:32.903]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:32.903 --> 02:59:35.784]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:59:35.784 --> 02:59:42.426]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:59:42.426 --> 02:59:45.127]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:59:45.127 --> 02:59:47.488]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:59:47.488 --> 02:59:48.308]  Others don't.
[02:59:50.768 --> 02:59:54.376]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.376 --> 02:59:57.583]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.765 --> 03:00:10.608]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.608 --> 03:00:12.189]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.189 --> 03:00:14.110]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.110 --> 03:00:17.932]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.932 --> 03:00:21.975]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:25.541]  All right, folks, little news update here.
[03:00:25.541 --> 03:00:27.281]  We're still live into overdrive.
[03:00:27.281 --> 03:00:29.582]  We'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:00:29.582 --> 03:00:32.323]  InfoWars Nightly News with the great news crew.
[03:00:32.323 --> 03:00:40.765]  Leanne McAdoo, Darren McBreen, John Bowne, Jakari Jackson, David Knight, and so many others that make it all possible.
[03:00:40.765 --> 03:00:43.566]  Don't forget, it's you out there, the viewers, that make it possible.
[03:00:43.566 --> 03:00:53.129]  As I said a thousand times, we're not like NPR that gets $400-plus million of taxpayer money and then begs for money from their audience as well, locally, to fund themselves.
[03:00:53.789 --> 03:00:56.251]  And then promotes anti-liberty, anti-freedom agendas.
[03:00:56.251 --> 03:01:13.644]  We're not like MSNBC and NBC that got over a billion dollars in bailout and stimulus money that then pay Rachel Maddow so no one can watch her as she tells you that your family is bad and that families are evil and your kids belong to her and all the rest of the Walruses masquerading as reporters.
[03:01:14.324 --> 03:01:17.729]  We're funded by bringing you high-quality, cutting-edge products.
[03:01:17.729 --> 03:01:25.281]  Molon Labe, Made in America, 1776 t-shirts, and things like that to say, hey, come and take it, scumbags.
[03:01:25.281 --> 03:01:28.486]  We'll talk like we want, we'll say what we want, we'll do what we want.
[03:01:29.875 --> 03:01:30.715]  Period.
[03:01:30.715 --> 03:01:41.679]  And again, my favorite shirt is the Molon Labe shirt that of course means come and take it in Latin, but goes back to the Greeks when they wouldn't turn in their swords and spears.
[03:01:41.679 --> 03:01:42.959]  We got two different variants of that.
[03:01:42.959 --> 03:01:44.420]  Those are made in America.
[03:01:44.420 --> 03:01:47.961]  Infowarsstore.com or madein1776.com.
[03:01:47.961 --> 03:01:49.582]  But since I mentioned this earlier,
[03:01:50.402 --> 03:01:51.463]  I want to get to it.
[03:01:51.463 --> 03:02:05.796]  I had this idea kind of last week, and then I saw stories all over the news today, one up at Infowars.com about bumper stickers popping up that say Ebola, but then in the O, it is the Obama symbol.
[03:02:05.796 --> 03:02:14.524]  So we now have a t-shirt that on the back says Ebola, Infowars.com, and on the front says Ebola.
[03:02:16.152 --> 03:02:21.795]  So we're the first to get these out, ladies and gentlemen, and I have announced a limited run.
[03:02:21.795 --> 03:02:23.075]  We have them in production right now.
[03:02:23.075 --> 03:02:26.697]  It'll take a few weeks to get them in, and then we'll ship them out, and that's it.
[03:02:26.697 --> 03:02:28.898]  So when they're sold out, they're sold out.
[03:02:28.898 --> 03:02:35.622]  We're doing 3,000 of the blood-spattered version, and a little less of the one that doesn't have the fake blood splatter version.
[03:02:35.622 --> 03:02:39.083]  But it's a great way to desecrate the political correct gods.
[03:02:39.083 --> 03:02:44.006]  It's a great way to say, we'll equate big government and tyranny
[03:02:45.413 --> 03:02:46.214]  With disease.
[03:02:46.214 --> 03:02:56.142]  In fact, we're going to add to that shopping cart page, if you go to the front page of InfoWars.com, a graphic that Kurt Nemo put together today.
[03:02:56.142 --> 03:03:07.471]  And in that graphic, that you can see again at InfoWars.com, you can see that it breaks down.
[03:03:07.471 --> 03:03:10.474]  In fact, let me just go to InfoWars.com and I can do that to the home page.
[03:03:13.917 --> 03:03:15.678]  It says Ebola.
[03:03:15.678 --> 03:03:16.879]  Front page.
[03:03:16.879 --> 03:03:21.803]  Anti-gun, anti-sovereignty, anti-liberty, tyranny is a disease.
[03:03:21.803 --> 03:03:23.724]  That's why we're putting this out.
[03:03:23.724 --> 03:03:29.268]  Because they say, oh, you can't criticize our Lord and Savior, as Jamie Foxx called him, Barack Hussein and Obama.
[03:03:29.268 --> 03:03:31.690]  Well, we are going to do it, even though he's a puppet.
[03:03:31.690 --> 03:03:32.310]  It doesn't matter.
[03:03:32.310 --> 03:03:34.552]  It's about getting in the face of the system.
[03:03:34.552 --> 03:03:38.895]  Remember back when we started promoting the Obama socialist joker image?
[03:03:38.895 --> 03:03:40.957]  When they tried to ban it in L.A., we put out our own version?
[03:03:42.478 --> 03:03:48.845]  And then all over the country people put her up and they were threatening to arrest them so more people put up and then they backed off.
[03:03:48.845 --> 03:04:01.558]  There is such a political correct intimidation to where now they say you can't be a geisha girl on Halloween or a cowboy that everyone is just groveling and going along with whatever they say.
[03:04:02.554 --> 03:04:05.396]  Well, we're not going to be part of this anymore.
[03:04:05.396 --> 03:04:13.361]  We must be politically incorrect, folks, because they're making the circle of what is kosher and acceptable smaller and smaller and smaller.
[03:04:13.361 --> 03:04:15.703]  I predict these will sell out in a week or quicker.
[03:04:15.703 --> 03:04:18.445]  The new Obama, Ebola,
[03:04:19.704 --> 03:04:26.588]  T-shirts, it says Ebola on the back with the Obama symbol as the O, and then Ebola on the front.
[03:04:26.588 --> 03:04:32.812]  We have the blood spattered, fake blood spattered, not real blood, folks, obviously.
[03:04:32.812 --> 03:04:34.293]  Two plus two equals four.
[03:04:34.293 --> 03:04:36.714]  We have that available, and then we have the one that's clean.
[03:04:36.714 --> 03:04:41.337]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:04:41.337 --> 03:04:47.981]  I want to thank you all for your support, becoming PrisonPlanet.tv members as well.
[03:04:47.981 --> 03:04:48.982]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:49.702 --> 03:04:52.927]  We'll see you back tonight, 7 o'clock, and back tomorrow, Lord willing.
[03:04:52.927 --> 03:04:53.868]  Don't take it for granted.
[03:04:53.868 --> 03:04:55.110]  We're under attack.
[03:04:55.110 --> 03:04:55.651]  So are you.
[03:04:55.651 --> 03:04:56.112]  11 a.m.
[03:04:56.112 --> 03:04:56.472]  Central.
