[00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:07.255]  I'm good.
[00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.950]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.990]  We're here in the St.
[00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.132]  Louis area, the areas that have been plagued by riots, protests, and also police brutality.
[00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:25.314]  But I want to bring your attention to something different here tonight, because we've talked about all those things, but let's talk about the lies of the mainstream media.
[00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:28.596]  This has come out on Fox 2 News now.
[00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:33.817]  It says, despite reports SWAT team helped Al Jazeera reporters did not take their equipment.
[00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:37.158]  And this is pretty much parodying a statement of the St.
[00:00:37.218 --> 00:00:38.839]  Charles County Sheriff's Department.
[00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:41.490]  And they said, no, we're not harming these journalists.
[00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.071]  We're not looting their equipment.
[00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:43.992]  We're helping them.
[00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:44.872]  Well, I was there.
[00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:53.797]  Infowars.com, the guys are coming in the trucks.
[00:00:54.598 --> 00:00:57.319]  They're coming to flank.
[00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:01.262]  Bobby, you don't have to.
[00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:02.182]  All right.
[00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:05.144]  So, here they come.
[00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:07.940]  They're popping big bangs.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.042]  Joe Biggs got shot with a rubber bullet.
[00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:11.843]  Now I'm running down the street.
[00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:13.604]  Man quit shooting at me!
[00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:17.887]  Quit shooting at me!
[00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:19.769]  You see they shooting at us!
[00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:21.030]  You see that?
[00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:33.480]  Because after having multiple gas canisters fired at me, I had to jump in somebody's yard or run through, and lo and behold, I happened to run into Al Jazeera.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.741]  There's also a local NBC affiliate out there as well.
[00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:39.302]  And they say they were helping, not harming Al Jazeera.
[00:01:39.483 --> 00:01:41.744]  You take a look at this footage and you tell me what you think.
[00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:43.784]  What's he doing at the news camera?
[00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:44.365]  Look!
[00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:46.426]  This is press over here!
[00:01:48.226 --> 00:01:49.747]  He's shooting at us!
[00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:50.807]  What's going on?
[00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:51.108]  Wow!
[00:01:51.128 --> 00:01:51.748]  Are you still on?
[00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:57.159]  There's a bunch of media over here trying to cover the story!
[00:01:58.641 --> 00:01:58.921]  Hello?
[00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:04.306]  Yeah, well we're getting shot at with rubber bullets right now, okay?
[00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:05.928]  So I don't know what to tell you.
[00:02:06.048 --> 00:02:06.488]  Yeah!
[00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.391]  That's a rubber bullet barrel, they've been shooting them at everybody.
[00:02:12.914 --> 00:02:18.219]  I mean, as of right now, we're okay until they start shooting rubber bullets in our direction.
[00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:31.743]  Whoa!
[00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:32.803]  They threw it at the news!
[00:02:32.863 --> 00:02:35.424]  Well, I'm news too, but you know what I'm talking about.
[00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:38.545]  We're moving!
[00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:41.726]  We're moving!
[00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:42.847]  Usher!
[00:02:42.887 --> 00:02:43.587]  Get Usher!
[00:02:43.927 --> 00:02:44.247]  Get out!
[00:02:44.508 --> 00:02:44.688]  Alright.
[00:02:46.048 --> 00:02:46.308]  Look!
[00:02:46.588 --> 00:02:48.049]  So they did it to the new media too!
[00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.349]  Usher!
[00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.351]  You got hit, bro?
[00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:55.652]  Hey, who do you guys work for?
[00:02:56.803 --> 00:02:57.944]  We're with Al Jazeera America.
[00:02:58.004 --> 00:02:59.025]  Al Jazeera America.
[00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:01.508]  So they pop smoke at Al Jazeera America.
[00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:07.273]  They fired a rubber bullet at us and then tear gassed us.
[00:03:07.493 --> 00:03:10.576]  They tear gassed Al Jazeera America.
[00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:12.839]  So you see, it's not just InfoWars.com.
[00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.840]  They'll pop it at anybody who's out here with a camera.
[00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:16.264]  So there it is.
[00:03:16.344 --> 00:03:18.646]  Proof positive of them targeting reporters.
[00:03:18.706 --> 00:03:20.487]  But according to them, it never happened.
[00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:21.488]  They were just there to help.
[00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.772]  So they come and they tell you to turn your video camera off before they storm you.
[00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:33.158]  And then if they catch you with your video camera on, then they bomb you with smoke grenades and then they shoot you with rubber bullets.
[00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:36.961]  But everything's fine because the Sheriff's Department came out and said so.
[00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:40.144]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.711]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
