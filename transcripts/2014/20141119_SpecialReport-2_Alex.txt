[00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:05.955]  Jakari Jackson back in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:08.237]  We're here on West Florissant Street.
[00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:09.898]  This is where you guys saw a lot of the action.
[00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:11.900]  The foot trip that was burned is right over there.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.962]  I want to take your attention now to just the area.
[00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:18.605]  A lot of these local businesses are boarding up their establishments.
[00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:24.469]  There's people right behind us screwing or drilling in nails into their doors trying to protect it.
[00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.931]  They don't want to talk on camera, but that's fine.
[00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:28.833]  Look, all this.
[00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:30.573]  I mean, it's completely boarded up.
[00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:37.377]  The hair salons, the barbershop, Liberty Tax, all this stuff going all the way down the street.
[00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:43.401]  And it was right here, last time I was here, the day they signed the curfew, Joe Biggs was here as well.
[00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:49.344]  And it was pretty much right there, Joe Biggs, where they tear gassed this, right over there in that area.
[00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:54.987]  So, this is one of the more, I guess, notorious parts of the city.
[00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:58.850]  And we're expecting to hear what's going to happen with Officer Wilson.
[00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.891]  We'll step out the street here.
[00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:06.616]  And the police chief has come out and said if Officer Wilson is cleared of his charges, he will return to active duty.
[00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:12.601]  And, you know, I don't wish any ill will against the guy, but I don't think it's going to work out too well for him.
[00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.863]  I hope he goes back to work at a desk just for his own personal safety.
[00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:20.066]  I don't think the people would be very accepting of that, and that's not threatening the guy.
[00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:22.628]  It's just, you know, concerned about his own personal well-being.
[00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.270]  But we'll continue to walk down here.
[00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:35.636]  It's all it's all boarded up going all the way on both sides of the street And right up here we'll walk up here to this McDonald's
[00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.298]  That's where those journalists were arrested.
[00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.022]  And I had a lightweight argument with one of the officers.
[00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:45.085]  There's a friendly debate talking about the actions of the police.
[00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.148]  And he's like, well, the police are out here to protect you, and what about this and what about that?
[00:01:48.168 --> 00:01:50.250]  I was like, what about those journalists you guys arrested over here?
[00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.032]  What about when you shot Joe Biggs with a rubber bullet?
[00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:54.255]  What, when you tear gassed me and Josh?
[00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:55.716]  He's like, well, I wasn't there for that.
[00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:58.459]  I was like, well, OK, just because you weren't there doesn't mean it didn't happen.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.961]  So yeah, this is the whole area.
[00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:03.763]  It's pretty quiet right now.
[00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:05.624]  The temperatures are dropping.
[00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:09.426]  They say it's going to be snowing, possibly later this afternoon.
[00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:11.287]  Everybody's saying about 2 o'clock.
[00:02:12.488 --> 00:02:17.991]  So that may calm any hostilities should nothing happen with Officer Wilson.
[00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.731]  So we'll be out here to report.
[00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:25.054]  We'll be out here for probably about the next week or so giving you guys the inside scoop.
[00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:28.516]  Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs reporting, InfoWars.com.
