[00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:06.070]  We're here at the spot where last week four Austin police officers were needed to subdue a single female jogger.
[00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.431]  The original offense, jaywalking.
[00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:12.212]  She was later on arrested for the failure to identify to an officer.
[00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:14.712]  What happened to the Miranda right to remain silent?
[00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:15.933]  What happened to the Fifth Amendment?
[00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:17.193]  What happened to the First Amendment?
[00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:18.353]  The freedom of speech.
[00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:20.433]  Does that also include the freedom not to speak?
[00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:22.134]  Let's find out what these students have to say.
[00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.254]  Hi, excuse me.
[00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:23.314]  Hi.
[00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:27.075]  What do you think about the jogger who got arrested out here last week?
[00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:31.666]  I actually think it's kind of funny because I cross the street all the time.
[00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:34.027]  What do you think about the jaywalker who was arrested last week?
[00:00:35.507 --> 00:00:36.488]  I don't know the whole story, do you?
[00:00:37.148 --> 00:00:40.069]  I don't know the whole story, but with what you heard, do you have any opinion?
[00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.330]  Because they say, well she was officially arrested for failing to identify to an officer.
[00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.851]  It wasn't the jaywalking charge.
[00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:53.393]  But just the police resources, do you think it's a good use of a police resource to be out here busting jaywalkers, just cracking down on jaywalking?
[00:00:54.457 --> 00:00:54.757]  I don't know.
[00:00:54.797 --> 00:00:56.778]  That's sort of like, you know, do you still beat your wife?
[00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.299]  Right?
[00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.000]  You can't really beat your wife.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.161]  You can't say whether you did or not because you'd be guilty either way.
[00:01:02.182 --> 00:01:06.264]  I don't necessarily agree with his comparison to beating your wife.
[00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:09.025]  I mean, busting a jaywalker is busting a jaywalker.
[00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:17.110]  My thoughts are that's pretty ridiculous, but it was a white girl in a nice part of town, and if it was anybody else, it wouldn't have made the news.
[00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.172]  If somebody gets hit from jaywalking, then that's their problem.
[00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:21.853]  You don't need four cops involved.
[00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:25.254]  I think he shouldn't have got arrested or she shouldn't have got arrested.
[00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:26.234]  Why is that?
[00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:27.995]  Because she was just crossing the street.
[00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:28.576]  Right.
[00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:35.800]  Well you know the official reason given for her arrest wasn't so much that she crossed the street, it was because she failed to identify to an officer.
[00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:38.242]  So that means she didn't show her ID?
[00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:38.902]  Is that the?
[00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:43.545]  Well she didn't provide the Austin Police Department with as much information as they desired.
[00:01:43.705 --> 00:01:45.746]  I mean are you familiar with your Miranda rights?
[00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:47.487]  Yes, I am familiar.
[00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:50.369]  Can you tell me one of the Miranda rights?
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.662]  You have a right to remain silent.
[00:01:54.182 --> 00:01:55.503]  There have been contradictory reports.
[00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:59.586]  The police are saying that they were in the young lady's field of view when they tried to grab her.
[00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:02.868]  There have been other reports saying that the officers approached her from behind.
[00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:06.530]  Quintero doesn't think the officer did run up beside her like Acevedo said.
[00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.695]  I think he grabbed her slightly from behind and it may not be from far behind but enough to where she didn't notice who was grabbing her right away.
[00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:21.039]  So, if you were out jogging, you got your headphones in, you're a single woman alone and somebody just grabbed you from behind, what would your reaction be?
[00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:22.280]  I would have kept running.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.601]  Um, all I heard, I read, was that she didn't see them coming and they grabbed her from behind.
[00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:31.542]  Whether or not he grabbed her by behind, it doesn't, it's not relevant.
[00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:34.322]  At some point, she knows it's a cop.
[00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:38.663]  If somebody was to grab you from behind for any reason, what would your reaction be?
[00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:43.104]  Um, definitely do exactly what she did, you know, kick their ass.
[00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:46.458]  Excuse me miss, you were jaywalking there for a second?
[00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.060]  I know your class, I'm sorry.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.763]  Okay, so she has to go to class and that's a good reason to jaywalk.
[00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:54.286]  I just want you to know you get arrested by the Austin Police Department.
[00:02:54.627 --> 00:02:57.029]  Let me ask you about some comments that the police chief made.
[00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.194]  He said that you know the big controversy of last week was that a jogger
[00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:01.858]  No.
[00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:03.459]  This has nothing to do with sexual assault.
[00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.199]  You can't compare that.
[00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:29.525]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:30.586]  That's totally uncalled for.
[00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:32.308]  I can't believe they would say something like that.
[00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.430]  That's ridiculous.
[00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.232]  I think that's an awful comparison.
[00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:36.894]  I mean, that's not a good standard.
[00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:45.864]  In other cities, cops are actually committing sexual assaults on duty, so I thank God that this is what passes for a controversy in Augustan, Texas.
[00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:49.891]  Be careful because they're rolling, they hatin', they're trying to catch you walking dirty.
[00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:50.752]  I know.
[00:03:51.252 --> 00:03:55.177]  As I jaywalk across the street, I can't help but think about the Austin Police Department.
[00:03:55.537 --> 00:04:01.864]  The Austin Police Department who would shoot an unarmed man in the back even though he doesn't match the description of a bank robbery suspect.
[00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:08.131]  About the Austin Police Department who would show up to the wrong address, shoot your dog, and shrug their shoulders and walk off as if nothing happened.
[00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:19.719]  Wouldn't these efforts, these police resources, be better served down at City Hall demanding that fluoride be taken out of the water, or demanding that GMO be taken out of food, or arresting the bankers who devalue our currency every day?
[00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:28.425]  So if you come to the city of Austin, Texas, and you find yourself arrested, the situation initiating from a jaywalking response, you can rest assured that the bar has been set high.
[00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:30.907]  At least you're not being raped by the police.
[00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:33.689]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:04:34.668 --> 00:04:35.008]  Oh, hi.
[00:04:35.148 --> 00:04:37.209]  Hi, you ladies are all jaywalking right now.
[00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:40.070]  Did you hear about the woman who got arrested last week?
[00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.311]  Her initiation was a jaywalking incident?
[00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:42.792]  No.
[00:04:43.092 --> 00:04:43.632]  You didn't hear that?
[00:04:43.652 --> 00:04:43.692]  No.
[00:04:44.132 --> 00:04:46.833]  Well, you better be safe, because they're out here rolling the rollers.
[00:04:47.214 --> 00:04:47.934]  They'll try to get you.
[00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:48.554]  All right?
[00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:49.234]  So be safe.
[00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:50.055]  Be safe.
[00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:52.016]  All right, and don't let anybody grab you from behind.
[00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:53.416]  They like doing that as well.
[00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:56.858]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time.
[00:04:57.018 --> 00:05:01.740]  But now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.941]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:06.843]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:05:06.903 --> 00:05:11.007]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:14.490]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.757]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:05:21.937 --> 00:05:33.021]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:34.562]  We are the resistance.
[00:05:34.842 --> 00:05:36.202]  You are the resistance.
[00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:38.143]  You are the info war.
[00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:42.425]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:44.286]  We are the true media.
[00:05:44.426 --> 00:05:47.007]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:05:47.107 --> 00:05:50.688]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
