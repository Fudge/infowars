[00:00:08.018 --> 00:00:27.332]  Well, Obama is in the neighborhood this week, and rather than visit the border to witness firsthand the crisis that is largely brought on by his failed policies, he is going to be partying it up with people who have paid anywhere from $10,000 to $35,000 to bask in his presence at one of his Democratic fundraisers.
[00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:31.375]  Tonight, he is in Austin, Texas, visiting the home of
[00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:40.127]  Austin-based filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, whose ultra-violent Machete franchise is very pro-illegal immigration.
[00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:48.739]  But instead of portraying illegal immigration in a positive, good-for-the-economy sort of way, Rodriguez's film bolsters support by
[00:00:49.219 --> 00:01:01.074]  Demonizing a Texas politician who's seeking to tighten border control, and also they portray a Minuteman-style American delighting and shooting a pregnant Mexican woman.
[00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:06.441]  So it's hard to tell if it's a pro-amnesty message or a La Raza cattle call.
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.161]  And, of course, Jessica Alba is going to be one of the special guests at tonight's fundraiser.
[00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.622]  Now, Robert Rodriguez has done a lot for the Latino community.
[00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:31.244]  He's launched the careers of a lot of Latino actors, and as well as his movie, Spy Kids, was one of the first theatrical franchises to feature a Latino family playing superheroes.
[00:01:31.284 --> 00:01:36.545]  They were the first Latinos featured in a heroic role, and Rodriguez did insist on that.
[00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:40.726]  Also, Rodriguez is a member of the National
[00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.747]  Council of La Raza.
[00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:51.514]  He's a president's council donator to La Raza, who of course promotes the race over everything else.
[00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:56.157]  And Rodriguez is one of the new minority owners of a television network.
[00:01:56.238 --> 00:02:10.809]  His El Rey network is geared towards a Hispanic audience, and he admits that his network, he will use it if the president or the White House calls upon him to use the network to reach out to the Latino voters.
[00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:26.728]  But of course, if the way Machete promotes illegal immigration is any indicator of how Robert Rodriguez is going to try and reach the Latino voters, well I guess we can expect to see more messages promoting racial division rather than bringing us all together.
[00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:31.050]  So, this is who Obama is spending his evening with tonight.
[00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:45.676]  Rather than visiting the border, rather than addressing the crisis, and actually acknowledging that this is a huge issue, and maybe just showing the American people, hey, I'm not afraid to go and be in these border facilities where there's all these contagious diseases running rampant.
[00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:50.077]  I mean, even that, to just go and show that, nah, he's gonna go with people who are paying $35,000,
[00:02:51.798 --> 00:02:52.299]  We're good to go.
[00:03:10.632 --> 00:03:16.238]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:03:16.438 --> 00:03:23.666]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:27.030]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.914]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:33.784]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:35.889]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
