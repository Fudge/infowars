[00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:07.255]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:08.956]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.696 --> 00:00:10.797]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:12.258]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.960]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.243]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:22.826]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:46.383]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this 27th day of May 2014.
[00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:53.750]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:55.496 --> 00:01:03.123]  And as usual, there is ultra-massive amounts of news and information that we are going to be covering in great detail today.
[00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:07.406]  And as usual, I don't even know where to start.
[00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.088]  There is so much of it.
[00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:20.497]  But Daniel Estillan, Bilderberg Hunter, will be joining us coming up in the third hour with a lot of inside intel on the top globalist Confab's agenda.
[00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:31.075]  Paul Watson wrote an article last week detailing a lot of key information.
[00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:32.596]  In fact, we're going to reprint that article.
[00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:37.338]  With Bilderberg Group member admits that it's the most powerful organization in the world.
[00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:39.979]  Paul Watson has a new article out today.
[00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.922]  Bilderberg agenda revealed elite desperate to rescue unipolar world.
[00:01:46.093 --> 00:01:53.521]  And the globalists basically admit in public statements, but also from our sources, that their world government is in deep trouble.
[00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:57.245]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down today.
[00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:00.268]  We would already have reporters on the ground in Switzerland.
[00:02:00.288 --> 00:02:03.952]  In fact, Paul Watson, not in Switzerland, in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:02:04.593 --> 00:02:07.416]  Paul Watson went to Switzerland before that a few years ago.
[00:02:07.436 --> 00:02:09.097]  Hence the slip.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.421]  Paul Watson is already in Denmark.
[00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:13.801]  We're going to get him to pop in later in the transmission as well.
[00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:26.726]  David Knight and Josh Owens were delayed because of ultra-massive storms all over Texas yesterday that cancelled all flights in Houston, where they were about to get on a plane and get over to Europe.
[00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:29.387]  But they should be over there.
[00:02:29.407 --> 00:02:31.508]  They should be getting on a plane in a few minutes.
[00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:37.050]  And be over there as well to give us live video feeds and more from Bilderberg 2014.
[00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.192]  Also, you may notice my voice is hoarse.
[00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:42.632]  I don't even really have a sore throat.
[00:02:42.652 --> 00:02:52.817]  I don't know what's in the air or what's going on, but this is what my larynx sounds like, so... I'm here, but it will sound even more frog-like than normal.
[00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:56.478]  I didn't realize until I got on air just how hoarse I am.
[00:02:56.498 --> 00:03:00.220]  So I'm going to try some Lung Cleanse from ForrestLife.com, see how it does.
[00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:06.609]  Maybe some olive oil.
[00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.710]  That helps a little bit, but it's pretty bad.
[00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:10.751]  Pretty bad.
[00:03:10.972 --> 00:03:15.014]  I got some swelling in one of my lymph nodes right here.
[00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:15.755]  I don't know what that is.
[00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:21.878]  But, ah, it certainly helped though, you can hear it.
[00:03:21.898 --> 00:03:23.759]  Essential oils in it are vital.
[00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:30.502]  Normally if my throat is a little tired or whatever, that just knocks it right out, but it's bad enough where it's only cut to 20-30%.
[00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:37.225]  So I'll continue to use the, I'm not trying to product place here, we obviously fund the operation, selling products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:39.987]  I just literally forgot to take it, so that's what I was doing right now.
[00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:43.222]  It's like my throat doesn't even hurt.
[00:03:43.362 --> 00:03:44.803]  It's like tiring to talk.
[00:03:44.843 --> 00:03:45.683]  I don't know how to describe it.
[00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:46.483]  It's weird.
[00:03:47.763 --> 00:03:50.204]  It was like this on Friday, and I did the Sunday show live.
[00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:52.565]  I thought it would go away, but it hasn't gone away yet.
[00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:54.825]  I need to go see a speech specialist or something.
[00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:59.646]  All the years of yelling and screaming is how my voice got so gravely, got more and more gravely.
[00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.887]  And then now, last Thursday, I blew up a bunch, started screaming on air.
[00:04:03.727 --> 00:04:05.768]  Over the three hours, probably 30 minutes of screaming.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.021]  And it's not an act, folks.
[00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:09.702]  I mean, when I scream, I really start yelling.
[00:04:10.582 --> 00:04:12.943]  And it just tears up my larynx, and I've just got to stop it.
[00:04:14.064 --> 00:04:21.568]  I've had a lot of speech experts, well-known ones, contact me and say, I'll give you free, you know, consultations.
[00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:26.031]  You need to come get lessons now or you're not going to have a voice in another 10 years.
[00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:26.811]  And you know what?
[00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:27.532]  I think they're right.
[00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:38.862]  I think I need to get my crap together and take care of my voice, because I may have an interesting signature voice from tearing it up, but then you can go over the mountain to the next level of not having a voice.
[00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:41.576]  So we've got those issues as well.
[00:04:41.596 --> 00:04:43.977]  We're going to take a lot of phone calls today.
[00:04:43.997 --> 00:04:46.739]  I want to get your comments on the state of the world and more when we come back.
[00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:48.020]  I'll give the number out.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.841]  But frankly, I'll just lean on the listeners.
[00:04:52.362 --> 00:04:54.463]  Just please, I'm just talking about my voices like this.
[00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:57.305]  Please don't call in and tell me you hope it gets better, okay?
[00:04:57.325 --> 00:04:58.486]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:58.866]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.982]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:11.382]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:13.083]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted.
[00:05:13.123 --> 00:05:19.344]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:05:19.484 --> 00:05:25.386]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:29.290]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.393]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:05:32.553 --> 00:05:40.580]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.883]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:43.984]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:53.093]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:05:53.293 --> 00:05:55.735]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.761]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:06.861]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:06:07.061 --> 00:06:13.023]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:06:13.243 --> 00:06:18.244]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:06:18.324 --> 00:06:23.026]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.

[00:06:36.632 --> 00:06:38.573]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:49.859]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:06.205]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:10.348]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:14.050]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.172]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:24.697]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:07:24.897 --> 00:07:28.540]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.044]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:07:33.204 --> 00:07:39.149]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.869]  Fluoride.
[00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:42.952]  It's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:07:43.132 --> 00:07:45.674]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:07:45.874 --> 00:07:47.215]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:48.616]  It's time to take action.
[00:07:48.737 --> 00:07:50.458]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:20.634]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:27.568]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:41.834]  There is so much incredible news on this live Tuesday, the 27th day of May 2014.
[00:08:42.454 --> 00:08:46.856]  Feels like a Monday with Memorial Day passing, but it's Tuesday.
[00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:52.018]  And I'm just gonna try as best I can to read headlines right now for everyone out there.
[00:08:54.073 --> 00:08:56.415]  Let's just start on the right hand side and move to the left here.
[00:08:57.856 --> 00:08:58.717]  Biggest yet!
[00:08:59.357 --> 00:09:04.641]  Greenwalled to publish names of Americans whom NSA is spying on.
[00:09:06.903 --> 00:09:12.808]  Suspended animation trials to begin on humans from CNET News.
[00:09:13.808 --> 00:09:19.253]  Bilderberg agenda revealed elite desperate to rescue their world government.
[00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:29.115]  That's up on Infowars.com with our reporters, Paul Watson and others, who are now on the ground in Copenhagen, Denmark, and will be reporting live throughout the week.
[00:09:30.275 --> 00:09:32.176]  Continuing, we'll be breaking all this down today.
[00:09:32.676 --> 00:09:37.037]  First Lady is set to respond to school meal critics.
[00:09:38.397 --> 00:09:41.518]  Why is the First Lady in charge of what our children eat?
[00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:46.919]  Why do we even have states or local governments or parents?
[00:09:46.939 --> 00:09:49.901]  I mean, there's nothing we won't put up with in this country.
[00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:56.886]  Retired officers poised to profit after Pentagon's alarmist climate change report.
[00:09:58.408 --> 00:10:01.030]  It turns out that all of the generals
[00:10:02.264 --> 00:10:02.565]  I think?
[00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:33.323]  And they're all political hacks pushing carbon taxes openly, and saying why the Pentagon says, why NASA says, we're all dead if we don't pay the world government trillions a year in carbon taxes, and more importantly, surveil every part of the economy.
[00:10:33.623 --> 00:10:40.628]  Then we have NBC, Good Morning America clips, you name it, killing their objective, their former generals, and don't have an axe to grind.
[00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:42.049]  They say it's real.
[00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:42.530]  Why?
[00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:43.670]  They're generals!
[00:10:44.628 --> 00:10:46.729]  See, because they know you don't listen to politicians anymore.
[00:10:46.749 --> 00:10:49.071]  They know you don't listen to media pundits anymore.
[00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:49.771]  You don't trust them.
[00:10:50.412 --> 00:10:56.936]  But generals, well, you know they are getting paid to put this bull out.
[00:10:58.356 --> 00:10:59.737]  So, that's coming up today.
[00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:03.039]  Tea Party poised for big wins in Texas.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.102]  And another sign that the Tea Party is the only opposition to the establishment right now.
[00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:10.644]  One percenter
[00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:16.120]  Wealth of Hillary Clinton complicates image as populist champion.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.361]  She's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:21.481]  I mean, in real money, nobody knows.
[00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:24.902]  She gets $200,000 a speech, that's a delayed payoff.
[00:11:27.183 --> 00:11:33.344]  That's how you influence pedal, folks, is you pay people to give speeches years after they've delivered the goods for you.
[00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:39.250]  Of course, there's nothing wrong with being wealthy if you didn't steal your money.
[00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:47.196]  In the case of Hillary Clinton, though, it does mess up her socialist anti-wealth persona.
[00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:51.899]  And The Hill reports, Hillary leaves the left cold.
[00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:54.180]  They're sick of her and they don't like her.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.582]  Well, that means they have to be force-fed her.
[00:11:57.262 --> 00:12:01.165]  You know, just tell the Democrats, well, people don't like her because she's a woman.
[00:12:03.046 --> 00:12:06.236]  Politico has the headline, the wary of Hillary Democrats.
[00:12:06.898 --> 00:12:09.065]  Everybody's sick of the establishment, that's what's happening.
[00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:12.389]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:18.294]  And again, I'm not even covering these headlines in a list of most important to least important.
[00:12:18.775 --> 00:12:20.536]  I'm just, I've got to get to this.
[00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:21.917]  I'm just at least mentioning the stories.
[00:12:22.698 --> 00:12:28.903]  This one has got to be a top story or one of the top stories because it illustrates everything we're talking about.
[00:12:28.943 --> 00:12:30.764]  It's in the Daily Mail out of the UK.
[00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:38.591]  BBC mauled for ruling girl is an offensive word.
[00:12:40.441 --> 00:12:44.922]  Members of Parliament lead growing outcry at political correct censorship.
[00:12:44.962 --> 00:12:45.943]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:12:47.783 --> 00:12:51.824]  When you hear that, what have you been conditioned to say in your mind?
[00:12:53.965 --> 00:13:01.067]  What are you thinking when I just read that headline, that if you use the word girl, you can be arrested?
[00:13:03.747 --> 00:13:05.088]  Oh, it's worse than this headline says.
[00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:07.301]  You're thinking, that's stupid.
[00:13:07.801 --> 00:13:08.722]  That's idiotic.
[00:13:09.342 --> 00:13:10.562]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:13:11.822 --> 00:13:13.383]  You know, the drug wars failed.
[00:13:14.063 --> 00:13:16.003]  Environmentalist wackos are nuts.
[00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:16.823]  No, they're not.
[00:13:17.043 --> 00:13:17.543]  They rule.
[00:13:20.704 --> 00:13:26.925]  The big drug companies, like Pfizer and Bayer and others, were always the main distributors of opium.
[00:13:29.946 --> 00:13:34.467]  And when opium monopolies got broken, they just made it illegal so they could control it.
[00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:37.937]  You're saying, what does that have to do with this?
[00:13:39.498 --> 00:13:41.119]  The establishment aren't idiots.
[00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:42.839]  They're not wackos.
[00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:44.100]  It's not that they're weird.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.840]  They rule the culture.
[00:13:48.881 --> 00:14:02.026]  And when people stop laughing at stuff like this, we will have a chance to start turning this society worldwide around.
[00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:27.533]  It is 1984, destruction of language, teaching people that every word out there is bad, and giving the adherents of the politically correct priesthood power to peck you on the top of the head politically, or disappear you into their bureaucratic social worker system.
[00:14:31.448 --> 00:14:32.529]  Whenever they feel like it.
[00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.733]  They are defining everything as a thought crime.
[00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:41.316]  So we're going to be breaking that down today at the bottom of the hour.
[00:14:41.337 --> 00:14:42.578]  That's a very important article.
[00:14:42.598 --> 00:14:43.578]  I want to detail it more.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.423]  But, this is how you reduce the language.
[00:14:50.424 --> 00:14:57.951]  All over the nation, they're saying no more Halloween parties, unless, at colleges, unless it's an authorized list of cough stims.
[00:14:59.912 --> 00:15:02.114]  And of course, that list will get smaller and smaller.
[00:15:02.174 --> 00:15:03.555]  You can't have a Native American.
[00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:05.177]  You can't have a Geisha girl.
[00:15:05.277 --> 00:15:08.019]  You can't have a guy in a sombrero.
[00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:10.601]  You can't have anything.
[00:15:12.563 --> 00:15:15.766]  You can't have taco parties or siestas or fiestas.
[00:15:17.287 --> 00:15:19.970]  You can't have a fiesta party because someone might be offended.
[00:15:21.343 --> 00:15:22.223]  And there's no free speech.
[00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:24.204]  They're just teaching you there's no free speech.
[00:15:24.805 --> 00:15:42.712]  Just like they told the churches in the 1950s, you still have your tax exemption under the First Amendment, go get a 501c3, and you waive your rights, and then become a government-run charity.
[00:15:45.093 --> 00:15:49.455]  It is not rhetoric to say we have state-run churches in this country.
[00:15:49.575 --> 00:15:50.596]  They officially are.
[00:15:54.594 --> 00:15:55.595]  I just want that to sink in.
[00:15:55.615 --> 00:16:14.988]  I mean, I'm looking at the headline here, where the New York Times is reporting, quote, tech firms attack law allowing feds to read email without warrant.
[00:16:17.472 --> 00:16:38.719]  Notice how we go from six, seven years ago that no one's reading anything without a warrant, you're a crazy five-headed kook, lunatic Alex Jones, if you say that, to, oh, the tech firms don't like the fact that all the emails go through the government servers first, and they have giant snooping arms inside their systems.
[00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:45.466]  The tech firms have a strategy, the big ones, they're behind all this.
[00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:47.127]  They're spying more than the NSA.
[00:16:47.427 --> 00:16:48.428]  They are the NSA.
[00:16:52.289 --> 00:16:55.691]  They don't want to be sued, so they're acting like they're against all this.
[00:16:56.131 --> 00:16:59.932]  Yahoo and Google and Facebook and Apple.
[00:17:00.393 --> 00:17:05.575]  Meanwhile, Apple runs death camps, basically, in China with suicide nets, forced abortions.
[00:17:07.785 --> 00:17:11.398]  Forced medical exam facilities and you see video of the people at their factories.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.108]  They literally look like zombies out of a horror movie.
[00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:34.761]  They take them, warehouse them for their organs, DNA test them, like the movie Coma from the 70s, and take you to a mobile execution van, kill you on the way to the airport, to fly your organs into Japan, where every day people get off the planes from the West to get, quote, the freshest organs.
[00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:45.006]  A Chinese government promo brochure a few years ago we covered said, in the Chinese translation into English, we have the freshest organs.
[00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:48.802]  This is what Apple will do to you and your family.
[00:17:48.822 --> 00:17:59.534]  This is what all these trendy Google operations, all of it, when they have control and they have an authoritarian regime to work with, you are below the level of scum.
[00:18:00.655 --> 00:18:02.237]  You are to be sucked up and used.
[00:18:02.257 --> 00:18:03.158]  You are trash.
[00:18:04.139 --> 00:18:07.103]  You are seen as trash by people that believe their gods.
[00:18:09.386 --> 00:18:15.347]  You take the words of Elliot Rodger, where he said, I'm a god, I'm gonna kill you.
[00:18:16.048 --> 00:18:18.768]  How many hundreds of times have I told you that's the elite's attitude?
[00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:29.251]  He was a product of a rich, wealthy, elitist, disconnected system, and he was on psychotropic drugs that now is coming out since age eight.
[00:18:30.771 --> 00:18:34.672]  He was a total product of being a modern demon.
[00:18:37.148 --> 00:18:44.851]  Now critics blame shooting on white male Hollywood and feminist groups are coming out saying this is why we need gun control.
[00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:46.171]  Yes, yes.
[00:18:46.872 --> 00:18:50.793]  Wouldn't it be pro-woman to arm women and teach women how to fight?
[00:18:51.853 --> 00:18:57.135]  Conservatives and libertarians teach their daughters how to fight, how to shoot guns.
[00:18:57.175 --> 00:19:00.677]  By the way, if you don't inhibit a woman being aggressive, they're vicious.
[00:19:04.078 --> 00:19:06.759]  My nine-year-old daughter, she's ten now, just turned ten,
[00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:10.220]  Can actually beat me up.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.980]  I mean, I mean, I could.
[00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:16.882]  I could beat her in a fight, obviously, but what I mean is when she's wrestling or punching me, it hurts.
[00:19:17.522 --> 00:19:18.043]  She's strong.
[00:19:19.403 --> 00:19:23.805]  I mean, I have to when she's wrestling with me, I have to really put strength into it to control her.
[00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:34.205]  And she, you know, her and my 11-year-old son get in fights and wrestle and, I mean, and he's big.
[00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:39.328]  And, you know, my dad's tickled my mother before.
[00:19:39.388 --> 00:19:42.089]  She knocked him out with a boot, a stiletto boot, hit him in the head with it.
[00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.271]  It was an unconscious, you know, flinch doing it.
[00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:49.914]  The whole point is that's feminism to empower women to be strong because they're just part of the tribe.
[00:19:49.934 --> 00:19:51.235]  We want the whole tribe to be strong.
[00:19:51.895 --> 00:19:58.828]  Modern feminism is about isolating women, destroying women, turning them into sexual objects, and wives to the state.
[00:19:59.329 --> 00:20:00.491]  The state is now your father.
[00:20:02.443 --> 00:20:05.604]  So my elementary school-aged child is begging me for a cell phone.
[00:20:05.624 --> 00:20:06.825]  Please, Mom, please!
[00:20:07.045 --> 00:20:07.965]  All the kids have them!
[00:20:08.005 --> 00:20:17.608]  But I've seen the research, and it makes sense to me that any mobile device that operates using electromagnetic frequencies that close to me or my child's head needs to be blocked.
[00:20:17.948 --> 00:20:20.189]  Harmful wireless radiation is real.

[00:22:04.068 --> 00:22:08.931]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:22:09.191 --> 00:22:17.036]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:22:17.296 --> 00:22:21.618]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:25.640]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:22:25.801 --> 00:22:31.503]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:22:31.744 --> 00:22:34.525]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:22:34.905 --> 00:22:40.048]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:08.114]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:33.427 --> 00:24:44.469]  Here is the clip of Elliot Rodger, the reported shooter of four people including himself, stabber of three others, so six that he killed, half died by knives.
[00:24:45.089 --> 00:24:52.971]  We had several articles about that over the weekend at Infowars.com, but the controlled corporate press is basically saying it's all because of guns.
[00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:59.732]  Senator Blumenthal has reintroduced bills to restrict the Second Amendment following the California shooting.
[00:25:00.968 --> 00:25:05.570]  And then there's a lot of debate about how many psychotropic drugs was this guy on?
[00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:11.392]  I mean, I took one look at him and I said, I guarantee you that guy has been in the psychiatric system for most of his life.
[00:25:11.952 --> 00:25:19.214]  Well, it's in the Associated Press now since age 8, and they are saying that he was being treated for, quote, Asperger's with medication.
[00:25:19.274 --> 00:25:20.315]  We don't know what type.
[00:25:20.835 --> 00:25:23.156]  Well, we should do the investigation and have the headline.
[00:25:23.596 --> 00:25:26.737]  What drugs was Santa Barbara Shooter on?
[00:25:30.433 --> 00:25:34.335]  Illness, not misogyny, made Elliot Rogers kill.
[00:25:34.475 --> 00:25:35.196]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:37.817]  And you're never gonna stop crazy.
[00:25:38.778 --> 00:25:42.500]  You have more guns, and they'll have less chance to kill more people, and that's been happening.
[00:25:43.361 --> 00:25:49.224]  The total number of shootings is down 52% since 1992, Justice Department-owned numbers.
[00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:57.829]  But see, reality doesn't have a very good shot, does it, in an age of deception.
[00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.932]  Have a bunch of people grandstand up there and say, collectively, gun owners are to blame.
[00:26:04.933 --> 00:26:07.494]  Well, do you want to take the blame out there as a gun owner?
[00:26:07.714 --> 00:26:08.735]  How about as a knife owner?
[00:26:09.155 --> 00:26:29.846]  I bet even the people out there that don't like guns and don't own guns, they are a minority in this country, about 45%, I bet you've got knives, and baseball bats, and golf clubs, and I bet you've got a stainless steel vase that you could club somebody's brains out with, or a hammer.
[00:26:31.499 --> 00:26:34.680]  You could kill people easier with a hammer than with a butcher knife in a lot of cases.
[00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:41.003]  Now I want to ask you right now, there are thousands of murders a year with baseball bats and hammers.
[00:26:42.523 --> 00:26:45.404]  Why have you not turned them in?
[00:26:45.445 --> 00:26:46.725]  You are to blame.
[00:26:46.785 --> 00:26:47.605]  This is madness.
[00:26:47.925 --> 00:26:56.609]  Not one more person can be allowed to die in this country by murder, by homicide, by the hands of another.
[00:26:58.226 --> 00:27:01.449]  And people are using cars to kill people by the hundreds on purpose?
[00:27:01.689 --> 00:27:02.350]  Ban all cars.
[00:27:03.371 --> 00:27:06.413]  They are using knives to kill people by the thousands?
[00:27:06.493 --> 00:27:06.874]  Ban them!
[00:27:07.975 --> 00:27:08.635]  Ban them now!
[00:27:12.619 --> 00:27:18.444]  How dare gun owners not turn their guns in with Sandy Hook and Aurora and now this?
[00:27:18.584 --> 00:27:20.846]  How dare you?
[00:27:21.226 --> 00:27:22.948]  We cannot wait one more day!
[00:27:22.968 --> 00:27:25.190]  This cannot happen one more time!
[00:27:26.633 --> 00:27:45.164]  That's what the media is putting out, and then all these victims' families who are being manipulated in their pain are crying on television, literally believing the propaganda that it's gun owners' fault, that the psychiatric system had this guy hopped up on stuff that the inserts says will make you kill people.
[00:27:46.425 --> 00:27:48.046]  And yes, folks, I'm saying he was on drugs.
[00:27:48.888 --> 00:27:54.171]  They admit he was being treated with medication, but they won't say what, because they don't want the blame.
[00:27:54.631 --> 00:28:10.719]  Because every time this happens, it takes two weeks to a month, and then it comes out with Adam Lanza, and Holmes, and Kip Kinkle, and Harris, and Kleibold, that they were on multiple serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, and Adderall, and Ritalin.
[00:28:11.379 --> 00:28:12.820]  You put people on speed.
[00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:17.504]  I have done methamphetamine two or three times in my life.
[00:28:17.544 --> 00:28:19.445]  I always say twice, but it was actually three times.
[00:28:19.845 --> 00:28:21.146]  I was thinking about it a few weeks ago.
[00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:30.774]  I remember all three times, I felt completely crazy, completely aggressive, and walked around with my buddies.
[00:28:32.015 --> 00:28:32.755]  I was like a teenager.
[00:28:33.942 --> 00:28:39.105]  For miles every day, and then day two would vomit everywhere and feel horrible for two days after.
[00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:40.906]  I'm like, how would anyone take this?
[00:28:41.646 --> 00:28:44.627]  And I've talked to people that are on Adderall and Ritalin, they say it's similar.
[00:28:45.748 --> 00:28:49.850]  I mean, they're putting kids on hard core drugs, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:50.811 --> 00:28:51.231]  Hard core.
[00:28:52.832 --> 00:28:53.272]  Hard core.
[00:28:54.492 --> 00:28:57.594]  And, of course, they're completely whacked out of their brains.
[00:28:58.094 --> 00:28:59.495]  Bathing in Californian
[00:29:01.184 --> 00:29:03.085]  In the narcissistic, sick culture.
[00:29:03.605 --> 00:29:05.086]  Bathing in the fakeness.
[00:29:06.086 --> 00:29:10.228]  Bathing in everyone acting like they don't care about anybody else and trying to pose and act snobby.
[00:29:11.229 --> 00:29:14.490]  I mean, I gotta tell you, Central and Northern California are nice people, I like it.
[00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:19.012]  Southern California, LA, you name it, is just a cesspit.
[00:29:20.033 --> 00:29:21.433]  And I'm honest about that.
[00:29:21.453 --> 00:29:24.315]  I know we got an affiliate that goes into LA, I'm just not gonna lie to you.
[00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.856]  And Santa Barbara, you name it, what a mess.
[00:29:29.577 --> 00:29:30.739]  And then we're to blame.
[00:29:31.199 --> 00:29:32.942]  All males are to blame, not just gun owners.
[00:29:34.484 --> 00:29:35.246]  Males are to blame.
[00:29:37.031 --> 00:29:38.813]  That some sick freak did this.
[00:29:39.073 --> 00:29:40.314]  This is the collectivism.
[00:29:40.635 --> 00:29:44.919]  This is the political correct tyranny that I'm going to talk about when we come back.
[00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:48.282]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:48.723 --> 00:29:49.463]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.284 --> 00:29:51.966]  I'm not trying to talk like a terrorist.
[00:29:51.986 --> 00:29:52.346]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.406 --> 00:29:54.108]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:57.712]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.744 --> 00:30:04.325]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:30:04.586 --> 00:30:09.448]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:17.592]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:22.135]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:30:22.355 --> 00:30:26.177]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:30:26.317 --> 00:30:32.022]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:30:32.262 --> 00:30:35.044]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:30:35.445 --> 00:30:40.669]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:30:40.809 --> 00:30:48.936]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:30:48.996 --> 00:30:49.176]  That's 866-229-0927.

[00:31:01.838 --> 00:31:09.681]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:31:09.941 --> 00:31:12.022]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:31:12.182 --> 00:31:14.803]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:31:14.883 --> 00:31:19.005]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:31:19.305 --> 00:31:22.466]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:31:22.486 --> 00:31:29.749]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:34.033]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:31:34.233 --> 00:31:35.935]  We are the true media.
[00:31:36.035 --> 00:31:38.638]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:31:38.738 --> 00:31:42.381]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[00:31:55.693 --> 00:32:04.094]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[00:32:04.194 --> 00:32:10.696]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[00:32:10.876 --> 00:32:13.476]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[00:32:13.676 --> 00:32:15.417]  If not, then I want to know why.
[00:32:15.617 --> 00:32:17.837]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[00:32:17.917 --> 00:32:22.118]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[00:32:22.378 --> 00:32:23.399]  I say, so what?
[00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:25.540]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.882]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[00:32:29.123 --> 00:32:33.265]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:39.129]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm still fighting.
[00:32:39.229 --> 00:32:42.271]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:44.173]  The Info War is worldwide.
[00:32:44.293 --> 00:32:48.415]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:52.218]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented facts.
[00:32:52.318 --> 00:32:59.392]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:32:59.572 --> 00:33:01.035]  The truth will set them free!
[00:33:15.655 --> 00:33:19.776]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:20.536 --> 00:33:22.017]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.077 --> 00:33:25.257]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:28.878]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:29.818 --> 00:33:32.379]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:33.419]  Central.
[00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:35.419]  2 p.m.
[00:33:35.459 --> 00:33:36.340]  Central.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.340]  Nightly News 7 o'clock weeknights.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.642]  And my voice is so shot, people would kill for a voice that sounds like this.
[00:33:43.662 --> 00:33:47.045]  And I would kill to not have my voice be like this.
[00:33:47.905 --> 00:33:54.289]  It gets a little old when a waiter comes over and you sound like a cross between Darth Vader and Clint Eastwood when you're ordering a drink or something.
[00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:56.951]  I gotta go get my larynx looked at.
[00:33:57.852 --> 00:34:01.134]  Okay, there is so much, so much to go over here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:01.634 --> 00:34:07.458]  Elliot Rodger had a autism spectrum disorder.
[00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:11.616]  And if you know folks that have Asperger's, it's real.
[00:34:12.056 --> 00:34:12.896]  They're like robots.
[00:34:14.097 --> 00:34:20.739]  They're highly intelligent, but they are like robots, at least part of their personality.
[00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:27.262]  And when they shift into the robot phase, it's like you're not even talking to a person.
[00:34:28.122 --> 00:34:30.903]  And a lot of the shooters are
[00:34:32.927 --> 00:34:36.750]  Ashbergers with shoot-em-up games, which is now coming out.
[00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:37.931]  This guy was a video game head.
[00:34:37.951 --> 00:34:43.055]  We're trying to cover up which ones because it's a 30, 40 billion dollar a year industry and growing just to shoot-em-up games.
[00:34:43.796 --> 00:34:45.437]  Getting bigger than Hollywood itself, by the way.
[00:34:46.558 --> 00:34:50.041]  Under psychiatric care since age 8, quote, being given treatment.
[00:34:51.242 --> 00:35:02.171]  And again, the treatment for Ashbergers is psychotropics, anti-psychotics, the same type of drugs that they give people for things like what they call bipolar.
[00:35:03.462 --> 00:35:12.169]  See, so much of the public is acting like schizophrenics now, and have personality disorders and borderline personality disorder, which you can give them labels, they're real.
[00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.772]  But more and more the public is completely out of their mind.
[00:35:17.454 --> 00:35:22.358]  And that's done because the brain has been rewired from birth, sitting in front of a television, that's on record.
[00:35:22.858 --> 00:35:31.805]  The wireless pollution, the chemicals, the biologicals, the GMOs that cause all sorts of mental illness, and genetic mutations in the brain,
[00:35:32.842 --> 00:35:34.344]  Uh, of lab animals.
[00:35:34.804 --> 00:35:36.086]  This is all happening with us.
[00:35:36.726 --> 00:35:39.209]  It's not just pediatric cancers up 10,000%.
[00:35:41.531 --> 00:35:44.675]  It's not just diabetes up type 2, 3,000%.
[00:35:44.835 --> 00:35:48.579]  In Hispanics it's more than that.
[00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:51.502]  They estimate by 2025 half the US will have diabetes, type 1 or 2.
[00:35:53.018 --> 00:36:01.982]  By 2025, that's only like 10 years away now, 11 years away, and that something like 75% or 80% of Hispanics will have it.
[00:36:02.663 --> 00:36:04.744]  And no one asked, why is this happening to Hispanics?
[00:36:07.105 --> 00:36:19.271]  Well, if you're Hispanic and have a lot of native blood, indigenous blood, those populations didn't eat sugar, folks, in high amounts, processed sugar, and they certainly didn't drink processed alcohol.
[00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:22.603]  And that's why it's a genetic fact.
[00:36:22.623 --> 00:36:24.947]  They would call me being discriminatory, the state of fact.
[00:36:26.289 --> 00:36:34.202]  That Indians, as they were known, back when folks thought this was India, 550-something years ago, they discovered the quote, new world.
[00:36:35.578 --> 00:36:40.200]  That if you sold some whiskey to the Indians, a bunch of them would end up drinking themselves to death.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:48.283]  Europeans, thousands of years of saving the grain they produced as alcohol through the winter, a completely alcoholic society.
[00:36:48.923 --> 00:36:52.225]  And all the studies are there that Europeans can drink more than anybody else.
[00:36:53.595 --> 00:36:56.356]  They got livers that can handle it, because everybody died who couldn't.
[00:36:56.856 --> 00:36:58.396]  Just like Europeans can handle smallpox.
[00:36:58.676 --> 00:37:02.397]  The smallpox has been in the old world for at least 10,000 years.
[00:37:02.517 --> 00:37:03.937]  They can dig up the bodies and see it.
[00:37:04.437 --> 00:37:08.058]  It was never here until Christopher Columbus showed up 500 plus years ago.
[00:37:08.358 --> 00:37:15.399]  But see, I'm not supposed to even have a scientific discussion here of fact and tell Hispanics how to not get their legs sawed off.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.740]  I drive by the bus stops.
[00:37:19.494 --> 00:37:20.695]  Every day, every day.
[00:37:20.715 --> 00:37:25.397]  I want to do a report on this and boil their faces, and I see the Hispanics with their legs chopped off.
[00:37:26.218 --> 00:37:26.798]  Young and old.
[00:37:28.139 --> 00:37:29.840]  It's a genocide.
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:36.263]  And I want to go warn them, but the Southern Poverty Law Center, CNN, would say I was racist.
[00:37:36.883 --> 00:37:43.347]  If I warned them that, hey, you can't drink alcohol, and you can't drink aspartame, that's wood alcohol, it will kill you.
[00:37:49.491 --> 00:37:51.292]  And you certainly can't eat processed foods.
[00:37:51.873 --> 00:37:53.174]  It will hit you a lot harder.
[00:37:53.574 --> 00:37:58.798]  Europeans have had a much more horrible diet for a long time than pretty much anybody else.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:07.163]  Europeans come from the Ice Age, ladies and gentlemen, and a totally different developmental cycle.
[00:38:12.847 --> 00:38:14.088]  But the BBC
[00:38:15.706 --> 00:38:19.469]  Says, I can't even say the word girl or I will be arrested.
[00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:20.810]  And people won't believe that.
[00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:24.954]  Guys, type in BBC presenter arrested for using the word homosexual.
[00:38:27.056 --> 00:38:28.957]  I had Robin Page on 10 years ago when this happened.
[00:38:29.178 --> 00:38:32.140]  And then he got so threatened by police when he came on, he wouldn't come back on.
[00:38:33.221 --> 00:38:35.223]  Robin Page was at a rural affairs meeting.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:42.202]  And he said, we deserve the same rights as rural communities as homosexuals and Muslims.
[00:38:42.622 --> 00:38:45.783]  And he was arrested and basically lost his job.
[00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:54.566]  One man and his dog, he would walk from pub to pub drinking beer and talking about cool rural areas all over the Britannic Isles.
[00:38:56.007 --> 00:39:02.109]  Well, the reason I mention that, and it's all going to tie together, is that political correctness now
[00:39:07.304 --> 00:39:09.626]  means you don't communicate on anything.
[00:39:10.427 --> 00:39:15.993]  You only repeat the provided message of the establishment.
[00:39:19.316 --> 00:39:29.186]  You only say what they say and then you're politically safe and you'll be secure in the fold with the niche you've been put in.
[00:39:29.446 --> 00:39:31.168]  This is called cult programming.
[00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:35.660]  And here is a great example today.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:42.964]  Now, remember two weeks ago they said that you can't have fiesta parties at universities nationwide if one person complains they're banned?
[00:39:42.984 --> 00:39:47.686]  Well, if somebody complained about the Klan on campus, they shouldn't be able to stop them.
[00:39:49.627 --> 00:39:52.989]  Not that we like the Klan, but because we don't want to lose our rights, correct?
[00:39:53.749 --> 00:39:54.449]  Of free expression.
[00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.710]  As real liberals.
[00:39:57.731 --> 00:39:58.792]  More freedom, not less.
[00:39:59.312 --> 00:40:01.053]  Because it's hurtful if somebody has
[00:40:02.728 --> 00:40:04.029]  A fiesta party.
[00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:12.355]  By the way, I was invited a few weeks ago to a pool party at a big condo, and guess what, folks?
[00:40:12.795 --> 00:40:20.901]  We happened to have a fiesta party with chicken and fajitas cooked on the grill, and people were drinking tequila and margaritas.
[00:40:21.241 --> 00:40:23.523]  Do you know who was out there at the same pool party?
[00:40:24.163 --> 00:40:26.425]  There were middle-class Mexicans
[00:40:27.449 --> 00:40:33.674]  Because a ton of those folks who moved up here because Mexico is so dangerous, they were all wearing little sombreros on their heads instead of a little party.
[00:40:34.614 --> 00:40:36.856]  And they were having a fiesta party too, because they were racist.
[00:40:37.557 --> 00:40:39.338]  So you were basically at a Klan rally?
[00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:44.642]  Well, I mean, we had the same idea to eat fajitas, and people were having margaritas.
[00:40:45.102 --> 00:40:45.883]  Because we're racist.
[00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:49.226]  It's not that we like the food or that culture.
[00:40:49.986 --> 00:40:56.051]  But these Mexicans, because we ended up partying with them some, they spoke pretty good English.
[00:40:57.898 --> 00:41:03.083]  And these guys in their senoritas, and we all kind of had a party, and it was because we were racist.
[00:41:04.084 --> 00:41:06.786]  You know, killing a million Iraqis isn't racist in the Iraq War.
[00:41:07.246 --> 00:41:11.330]  Putting cancer viruses in vaccines, shooting black people up with syphilis, that's not racist.
[00:41:12.031 --> 00:41:15.134]  Aborting 52% of blacks in this country before they're born, that's not racist.
[00:41:16.054 --> 00:41:24.142]  What's racist, or sexist, is if somebody on a bunch of drugs and psychiatric care, who's mentally ill, goes out and shoots people,
[00:41:25.339 --> 00:41:26.559]  Because he was obsessed with girls.
[00:41:26.939 --> 00:41:28.700]  Classic Ashbergers, be obsessed with something.
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.440]  And then throw a fit if they can't control it.
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.521]  It's our fault.
[00:41:34.661 --> 00:41:35.741]  Not just if you're white.
[00:41:35.941 --> 00:41:37.621]  If you're black, Hispanic, Asian.
[00:41:38.381 --> 00:41:39.601]  John, it's your fault.
[00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:42.882]  So do you want to take blame right now for the killings in California, John?
[00:41:43.702 --> 00:41:44.382]  I might as well.
[00:41:45.182 --> 00:41:51.703]  I was at a pool party myself a couple of weeks ago and there was a guy with a sombrero on and the guy next to him said, you better take that off.
[00:41:52.624 --> 00:41:52.804]  Really?
[00:41:52.824 --> 00:41:53.384]  I didn't know that.
[00:41:53.564 --> 00:41:53.744]  Yeah.
[00:41:55.103 --> 00:41:55.643]  It's rampant.
[00:41:56.764 --> 00:41:58.566]  The conditioning is rampant.
[00:42:00.888 --> 00:42:05.691]  Well, I want you to apologize right now because you're a male and you're white, doubly.
[00:42:06.352 --> 00:42:08.814]  Do you want to apologize for the deaths in California?
[00:42:10.535 --> 00:42:15.099]  I just want to apologize for California for being so plastic.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.661]  But I mean, think about the mind control.
[00:42:17.681 --> 00:42:18.702]  This is done on purpose.
[00:42:18.742 --> 00:42:21.184]  This isn't political correctness out of control.
[00:42:21.464 --> 00:42:22.084]  Here's the headline.
[00:42:22.965 --> 00:42:23.405]  BBC
[00:42:24.989 --> 00:42:28.551]  Mauled for ruling girl is offensive word.
[00:42:28.591 --> 00:42:30.872]  Member of Parliament leaves growing outcries.
[00:42:30.912 --> 00:42:35.434]  Political correct censorship expands.
[00:42:35.534 --> 00:42:42.138]  BBC cut the G word from a repeat of the Commonwealth Games documentary because the guy goes, oh my gosh, I got beat by a girl.
[00:42:44.859 --> 00:42:45.919]  Everything is offensive.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.900]  Fiesta parties.
[00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:52.403]  Government run
[00:42:54.298 --> 00:43:02.523]  Colleges say you will not be a geisha girl, you will not be a cowboy, no stereotypes, you will not be an Indian, you will be nothing.
[00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:07.145]  See, this is about them having the authority over everything.
[00:43:07.866 --> 00:43:14.570]  And now in Europe passing laws where you're arrested if you use the word girl or homosexual.
[00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:19.973]  There's no law saying those are illegal words, but they put spies in London restaurants
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:29.082]  And in Sheffield restaurants, it's in the news, look it up, spying to hear if someone says a word that's wrong and they arrest you.
[00:43:29.623 --> 00:43:31.343]  This is just training you that you're disappeared.
[00:43:31.763 --> 00:43:40.406]  You want to put 20% of children under the age of 17 down to age 2 on antipsychotics, psychotropics and speed that brain damages them?
[00:43:40.566 --> 00:43:40.946]  That's fine.
[00:43:42.537 --> 00:43:52.304]  You want to engage in every obscenity out there and have breast cancer exploding everywhere with glyphosates in the entire water supply that literally, on record, they admit grows the tumor?
[00:43:52.804 --> 00:43:54.385]  There's no discussion of getting glyphosates out.
[00:43:54.725 --> 00:43:55.666]  It's just fine to cure it.
[00:43:57.407 --> 00:43:58.908]  Not, why are our women all dying?
[00:43:58.968 --> 00:44:02.611]  No, no, it is because, well, you know, we'll have a race.
[00:44:03.571 --> 00:44:08.855]  We'll give some money to the cancer institutes and groups that are openly covering up the fact this is an engineered program.
[00:44:11.104 --> 00:44:14.806]  And we'll all just go along with the social engineering and feel good about ourselves.
[00:44:15.526 --> 00:44:22.830]  And again, they've said, how dare anyone own guns?
[00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:30.794]  They've had fathers come out repeating what the media is saying, the talking point of how dare you gun owners, you craven cowards.
[00:44:31.932 --> 00:44:33.533]  You caused all the death.
[00:44:34.134 --> 00:44:36.775]  You did it, the NRA and you gun owners.
[00:44:36.936 --> 00:44:38.156]  When is this going to stop?
[00:44:38.196 --> 00:44:40.338]  We cannot have one more person die.
[00:44:40.838 --> 00:44:41.359]  Close quote.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.281]  Remember the father said that Sunday.
[00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:45.962]  And I feel sorry for him, but you know what?
[00:44:46.022 --> 00:44:47.783]  I didn't have anything to do with your son's death.
[00:44:50.174 --> 00:44:53.557]  And my guns protect me and my family, just like cars kill hundreds of thousands.
[00:44:54.077 --> 00:44:56.419]  I mean, we can't have one more death on the highways.
[00:44:56.499 --> 00:44:57.160]  It's so terrible.
[00:44:58.041 --> 00:45:00.803]  You craven car owners, we must ban them now.
[00:45:00.863 --> 00:45:03.425]  Not one more automobile death on the highways.
[00:45:05.947 --> 00:45:09.230]  I mean, it's obscene to blame gun owners for this.
[00:45:10.697 --> 00:45:12.277]  I'll tell you who it's not obscene to blame.
[00:45:13.058 --> 00:45:22.480]  It says on the inserts of the psychotropics and the amphetamine drugs they're giving our kids that it can make you go totally insane, have megalomania, murder people, you name it.
[00:45:23.081 --> 00:45:30.963]  And it's the California sick plastic culture and the pharmacological psychiatric system that kills your son more than anything.
[00:45:32.984 --> 00:45:37.425]  But at the end of the day he was killed by a plastic mentally ill monster
[00:45:40.936 --> 00:45:45.978]  Mr. Martinez, not by Alex Jones.
[00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:55.081]  And again, at a very core level, I found it very offensive that this meme is being put out everywhere.
[00:45:58.802 --> 00:46:00.603]  That when something happens, it's our fault.
[00:46:01.343 --> 00:46:03.544]  And we've gotten to the point where you can't say the word girl.
[00:46:03.804 --> 00:46:05.625]  And whatever happens in England ends up happening here.
[00:46:05.665 --> 00:46:08.986]  People say it's asinine to say you can't dress up like a cowboy at the party.
[00:46:10.247 --> 00:46:11.808]  Because that's against rural workers.
[00:46:11.868 --> 00:46:13.608]  Or it's asinine to say you can't dress up like a pirate.
[00:46:14.429 --> 00:46:15.129]  Or a geisha girl.
[00:46:15.649 --> 00:46:18.350]  Of course dressing up like a geisha girl isn't putting down Japanese.
[00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:19.851]  It's the fun of the party.
[00:46:19.891 --> 00:46:20.651]  How are you going to dress?
[00:46:21.131 --> 00:46:22.552]  Everyone knows that instinctively.
[00:46:22.772 --> 00:46:23.872]  So you say, oh, that's crazy.
[00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:24.853]  No, it's not crazy.
[00:46:25.393 --> 00:46:26.474]  It's authoritarianism.
[00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:27.454]  It's a cult takeover.
[00:46:28.783 --> 00:46:31.425]  I want to play a clip of who killed the people.
[00:46:32.025 --> 00:46:39.851]  The wind-up toy monster created by this sick, unhealthy, unnatural, modern, pharmakeia society.
[00:46:40.632 --> 00:46:48.718]  If you want to know where the blame lies, it lies with the Hollywood director parents.
[00:46:50.134 --> 00:47:07.468]  And the system that gave them the fake moral authority to institutionalize their son from age eight so that he was completely screwed up, and then the modern corrupt Hollywood culture behind it of death and people like Bill Maher saying, I want more death, more death, more killings, more suicide.
[00:47:08.088 --> 00:47:10.090]  All these so-called liberals love death.
[00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.311]  All they talk about is death.
[00:47:11.871 --> 00:47:17.616]  Because they're a bunch of spoiled sicko brats at the end of a decadent cycle before our society collapses.
[00:47:17.876 --> 00:47:18.597]  Let's play this clip.
[00:47:20.168 --> 00:47:23.490]  Well now, I will be a god compared to you.
[00:47:24.511 --> 00:47:25.672]  You will all be animals.
[00:47:27.192 --> 00:47:29.994]  You are animals, and I will slaughter you like animals.
[00:47:31.976 --> 00:47:37.979]  I'll be a god, exacting my retribution on all those who deserve it.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:39.780]  And you do deserve it.
[00:47:42.082 --> 00:47:45.024]  Notice that he's a god, because he's gonna have a gun.
[00:47:46.365 --> 00:47:54.782]  And he's going to go into a victim disarmament zone in California with a bunch of trendies who would never have a gun and he's going to kill them because they're animals because they can't defend themselves.
[00:47:55.143 --> 00:47:56.445]  He's a god with that gun.
[00:47:57.486 --> 00:47:58.806]  Well, I'm not a God, I'm just a man.
[00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:03.428]  But I need guns to protect myself from out-of-control government, out-of-control institutions.
[00:48:03.488 --> 00:48:18.892]  Now, one of the TV end producers here, graphics guys, Joe Jennings, who works here in the office, does a great job the last four or five months, one of our new hires, he heard me talking about what Luvox and
[00:48:20.205 --> 00:48:28.411]  Ritalin and Adderall, you know, both the Prozac-type drugs and the speeds due to kids, and he was just describing during the earlier break what it did to him.
[00:48:29.212 --> 00:48:33.875]  So I thought we'd let him give you some of his testimony since he had the courage to come on air.
[00:48:34.595 --> 00:48:38.979]  Joe Jennings, fellow Info Warrior, just briefly tell folks your experience with these drugs.
[00:48:39.639 --> 00:48:44.343]  Well, I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age in California.
[00:48:45.485 --> 00:48:50.009]  Uh, and, you know, I was just a very vibrant child.
[00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.151]  Most mammals are.
[00:48:52.251 --> 00:48:54.452]  Most, most juvenile mammals jump around and do stuff.
[00:48:54.472 --> 00:48:55.353]  Yeah, that's what they're supposed to do.
[00:48:55.373 --> 00:48:56.294]  Yeah, I was loud as being a kid.
[00:48:56.794 --> 00:49:04.440]  So, uh, they prescribed Ritalin for me to help me focus in school and focus on my mental stability.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.162]  Because it will burn you out after about a month.
[00:49:06.533 --> 00:49:17.077]  Yeah, as soon as they put me on Ritalin, as soon as they put it on, my teachers in class go, call my parents up and go, there's something wrong with your child now.
[00:49:17.437 --> 00:49:23.859]  Before he was vibrant and social, now he's like a zombie who doesn't do anything.
[00:49:23.979 --> 00:49:25.660]  He just sits there in his own world.
[00:49:26.969 --> 00:49:29.473]  And my parents wouldn't wait to search something wrong with this.
[00:49:30.274 --> 00:49:31.937]  So... That's because they were extremists.
[00:49:32.297 --> 00:49:32.498]  Yeah.
[00:49:32.658 --> 00:49:33.860]  Why didn't they trust the state?
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.024]  I mean, that's what Obama and Kerry, they all just say, keep the faith.
[00:49:37.045 --> 00:49:37.826]  They even use that term.
[00:49:38.326 --> 00:49:39.809]  Why don't you want to worship the state, brother?
[00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:45.472]  I don't know, maybe I'm just... Do you want to say it's your fault that people died in California?
[00:49:45.492 --> 00:49:45.992]  Are you a gun owner?
[00:49:46.012 --> 00:49:53.574]  You know, I'm not a gun owner, but you know, it probably was my fault because I let people get put on these Ritalin drugs and stuff like that.
[00:49:54.194 --> 00:49:56.875]  I guess in a way we are all guilty for this society.
[00:49:56.935 --> 00:49:57.935]  We're okaying this.
[00:49:58.015 --> 00:50:01.816]  We're okaying numbing our children and completely taking their identity.
[00:50:02.756 --> 00:50:03.176]  So what happened?
[00:50:03.216 --> 00:50:03.816]  Did you get off of it?
[00:50:04.836 --> 00:50:07.197]  No, they prescribed me dexedrine to bring me back up.
[00:50:08.188 --> 00:50:14.013]  So they put me on Ritalin, and then they put me on Dexedrine as a combo to level me out.
[00:50:14.314 --> 00:50:14.794]  How was that?
[00:50:15.475 --> 00:50:15.835]  Horrible.
[00:50:16.596 --> 00:50:19.358]  You know, I was still numb, it's just I had energy now.
[00:50:20.159 --> 00:50:26.485]  So, after a while, we just completely... Do you know what speed does of all types to fast-growing brain cells?
[00:50:27.145 --> 00:50:27.946]  No, I don't.
[00:50:27.966 --> 00:50:29.728]  It's not good.
[00:50:30.288 --> 00:50:32.190]  You know, they used to spray paint in the 60s and 70s.
[00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.791]  Speed kills.
[00:50:34.499 --> 00:50:35.480]  On the highway.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.340]  I wouldn't doubt it.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:37.661]  I mean, it was horrible.
[00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:42.303]  As a child, you know, I got put into counselors and all kinds of stuff.
[00:50:42.923 --> 00:50:44.164]  Oh, there's something wrong with him.
[00:50:44.184 --> 00:50:45.404]  There's something wrong with him.
[00:50:45.744 --> 00:50:47.745]  And, oh, well, let's just give him more medication.
[00:50:48.046 --> 00:50:48.806]  Let's just do that.
[00:50:50.006 --> 00:50:50.807]  That's the plan.
[00:50:51.067 --> 00:50:51.867]  That's the system.
[00:50:52.488 --> 00:50:54.248]  And it's destroying our whole society.
[00:50:54.569 --> 00:50:55.329]  Will we turn back?
[00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:56.990]  No, because it's racist.
[00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.531]  We must do what the government says or we're racist.

[00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:08.753]  How much worse does it have to get?
[00:54:09.314 --> 00:54:10.678]  We know the system's killing us.
[00:54:12.522 --> 00:54:15.530]  I talk to people in the system, social workers, cops, you name it.
[00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:16.352]  They know it's bad.
[00:54:18.993 --> 00:54:23.617]  This is a military operation, a globalist mind control operation against the population.
[00:54:24.717 --> 00:54:25.318]  They now admit that.
[00:54:25.358 --> 00:54:29.701]  They say the CIA domestically engages in psyops through the news against the American people.
[00:54:30.141 --> 00:54:32.844]  They've been doing it since the 40s, but now they legalize it this year.
[00:54:33.264 --> 00:54:34.425]  It'd been illegal before.
[00:54:34.465 --> 00:54:38.908]  They said, oh, it's legal now to lie to you and run psyops against you.
[00:54:38.948 --> 00:54:42.031]  And the goal is to get the public on drugs, illegal and legal.
[00:54:42.791 --> 00:54:44.075]  And the big banks launder the money.
[00:54:44.436 --> 00:54:49.048]  Joe, how did it all end when they put you on multiple drugs when you were a child?
[00:54:50.253 --> 00:54:58.356]  Well, finally, after, you know, years, I just couldn't, you know, my parents couldn't justify doing this to their child.
[00:54:58.817 --> 00:55:02.858]  So, they remembered that you were better before they put you into the soft kill grid?
[00:55:02.998 --> 00:55:03.219]  Yes.
[00:55:03.659 --> 00:55:07.680]  And they said, you know, but... You were all queued up to be completely destroyed, though.
[00:55:08.021 --> 00:55:08.281]  Oh, yeah.
[00:55:08.561 --> 00:55:10.882]  I mean, they'd have you at your age today on 15 drugs.
[00:55:11.182 --> 00:55:11.942]  Oh, yeah.
[00:55:11.962 --> 00:55:12.823]  They would have tried it all.
[00:55:12.923 --> 00:55:17.064]  I mean, Zolofts, they would have, whatever, just to alter my mood because I was too...
[00:55:18.405 --> 00:55:18.926]  Energetic.
[00:55:19.286 --> 00:55:20.727]  I was too... Racist.
[00:55:21.588 --> 00:55:22.289]  Thought crime.
[00:55:22.569 --> 00:55:23.730]  Yeah.
[00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:26.112]  I was questioned when I went to church.
[00:55:26.412 --> 00:55:27.213]  I was questioned.
[00:55:27.313 --> 00:55:28.394]  Oh, just please don't do that.
[00:55:28.434 --> 00:55:29.875]  Now that's illegal.
[00:55:30.676 --> 00:55:31.617]  So, how did it all end?
[00:55:32.417 --> 00:55:38.763]  They finally took me off of them and I just, you know, as I started becoming older, I didn't need it anymore.
[00:55:39.123 --> 00:55:42.286]  You know, my thought patterns were leveled out, I guess.
[00:55:42.306 --> 00:55:43.747]  Well, that's why they want to get you when you're young.
[00:55:44.588 --> 00:55:46.708]  So they can screw you up as early as possible.
[00:55:47.209 --> 00:55:50.229]  But see, you were able, because of high intelligence, to get over it.
[00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:52.770]  Most people, they do that too, end up being institutionalized.
[00:55:53.230 --> 00:56:09.593]  And I saw a statistic a few years ago, you're four times more likely, the Feds even admit that, people can bull this up, I don't remember the exact study, but there's been multiple studies, that when you've been put on psychotropics, or Luvox, or, you know, the Adderall and stuff, you're four times more likely to end up on illegal drugs.
[00:56:10.153 --> 00:56:12.554]  It totally primes you to want Pharmakea.
[00:56:13.234 --> 00:56:13.474]  Oh yeah.
[00:56:13.534 --> 00:56:14.595]  So, I mean, what do drug dealers do?
[00:56:14.635 --> 00:56:15.636]  They start kids young.
[00:56:16.517 --> 00:56:16.757]  Yeah.
[00:56:17.058 --> 00:56:21.982]  I mean, you know, in high school, what most high school students would do back then?
[00:56:22.182 --> 00:56:26.046]  Well, there's a huge black market now and people grinding up their Adderall and their Redline, people snorting it.
[00:56:26.386 --> 00:56:29.569]  And that's what I hear, and I go, why would you do that?
[00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:32.352]  They also smoke the serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:56:32.852 --> 00:56:33.653]  That's hallucinogenic.
[00:56:34.053 --> 00:56:41.746]  Yeah, well, see, the weird thing was, you know, Ritalin, when people say that they snorted and do it, and Ritalin worked reversal on me.
[00:56:42.067 --> 00:56:45.092]  It mellowed me out to a point, which was kind of weird.
[00:56:45.132 --> 00:56:47.676]  That's why they gave me the dexedrine to bring me back up.
[00:56:48.618 --> 00:56:53.081]  Now, when I hear about these kids doing Ritalin, I say, well, why would you do that?
[00:56:53.101 --> 00:56:53.822]  You're going to go to sleep.
[00:56:54.102 --> 00:56:54.322]  No.
[00:56:55.723 --> 00:56:56.604]  It's an upper for them.
[00:56:57.104 --> 00:57:01.567]  Well, I mean, it does work on some people to settle them down, but what you don't want was the red dyes, the chemicals.
[00:57:01.607 --> 00:57:07.231]  What, just last week another study came out that it was the fertilizers doing it on kids in the fruits and vegetables.
[00:57:07.851 --> 00:57:08.532]  You were aware of that.
[00:57:08.612 --> 00:57:08.772]  Yeah.
[00:57:09.112 --> 00:57:16.317]  But more importantly, they admit that the chemicals and the bisphenol A, oh, was affecting reproduction and was affecting mood.
[00:57:17.478 --> 00:57:19.879]  They're drugging us through the packaging on purpose.
[00:57:20.379 --> 00:57:23.721]  That's what the White House Science Czar said 40 years ago.
[00:57:24.221 --> 00:57:27.602]  Yeah, but they forget about, you know, stuff that's genetic.
[00:57:28.743 --> 00:57:37.346]  And, you know, my brother, his child has supposedly ADHD, and he once put her on Adderall, and I said, no, no, no, no, do not do that.
[00:57:38.186 --> 00:57:39.827]  Don't, there's nothing wrong with her.
[00:57:40.327 --> 00:57:41.108]  Did he get her off of it?
[00:57:41.388 --> 00:57:41.568]  Yes.
[00:57:42.506 --> 00:57:43.066]  He finally got her.
[00:58:12.466 --> 00:58:12.810]  I'm blind.
[00:58:14.434 --> 00:58:16.555]  Pregnant women should take iodine supplement.
[00:58:16.635 --> 00:58:24.020]  Documents show massive increases in birth defects and problems because people are not getting iodine in North America.
[00:58:24.381 --> 00:58:25.221]  We have the best.

[00:58:49.536 --> 00:58:49.896]  Get ready.
[00:58:51.556 --> 00:58:56.118]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[00:58:56.278 --> 00:58:59.239]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:58:59.399 --> 00:59:04.621]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:06.602]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:59:06.882 --> 00:59:08.202]  We are what we eat.
[00:59:08.522 --> 00:59:10.423]  Our food is devoid of nutrition.
[00:59:10.603 --> 00:59:11.503]  We're good to go.

[01:00:06.448 --> 01:00:07.088]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.769 --> 01:00:08.789]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.529 --> 01:00:10.650]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:12.090]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.871 --> 01:00:13.731]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:18.053]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.613 --> 01:00:22.715]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.955 --> 01:00:30.118]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:30.158 --> 01:00:34.340]  We covered a ton of news and basic cultural analysis.
[01:00:35.515 --> 01:00:38.718]  In the last hour, I'd like to get your take on the issues I raised.
[01:00:39.418 --> 01:00:42.301]  Political correctness being total mind control in the globalist's own words.
[01:00:42.841 --> 01:00:49.947]  The shooting rampage over the weekend last Friday broke big Saturday that they are using to now demonize gun owners collectively.
[01:00:50.968 --> 01:00:52.509]  Half the people he killed were killed with a knife.
[01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:55.612]  We need to get that news out to folks.
[01:00:56.764 --> 01:01:00.887]  Also, this is really a scary article I want to cover after we take some calls.
[01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:05.330]  Government plan would transform Israel to the world's first cashless society.
[01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:06.091]  Man, that's bad.
[01:01:07.672 --> 01:01:11.975]  And we'll also get into Bitcoin is on a major tear upwards.
[01:01:11.995 --> 01:01:18.020]  We're going to break down Swiss group to allow assisted dying for elderly who are not terminally ill.
[01:01:20.582 --> 01:01:22.083]  I want to get into the first lady.
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.663]  Set to respond to school meal critics?
[01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:28.326]  I mean, that right there is such a bizarro headline.
[01:01:29.988 --> 01:01:31.650]  Why is the First Lady over what we eat?
[01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:38.919]  I mean, imagine if we said, in North Korea, Kim Jong Un decides what the kids eat.
[01:01:39.827 --> 01:01:41.268]  You'd go, that dirty dictator.
[01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:44.269]  But here it's like, oh my gosh, she's our mummy.
[01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:46.210]  It's good to have women tell you what to do.
[01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:47.131]  That's very feminist.
[01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.132]  She's a total front, folks.
[01:01:49.152 --> 01:01:50.672]  She doesn't come up with what the kids are fed.
[01:01:51.173 --> 01:01:55.295]  They have actuaries by the big agri-companies to gobble up the market.
[01:01:55.335 --> 01:02:00.437]  Bill and Melinda Gates are involved to feed kids the worst crap, GMO, worse than prison food.
[01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:03.519]  And then it's like, but it's a black lady promoting it.
[01:02:03.779 --> 01:02:05.140]  You're not racist, are you?
[01:02:06.135 --> 01:02:09.658]  They have disinfo articles about, under her plan, kids would have salad bars.
[01:02:09.678 --> 01:02:10.579]  They always had salad bars.
[01:02:10.859 --> 01:02:11.760]  Now they've gotten rid of them.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:12.981]  I know.
[01:02:13.201 --> 01:02:15.423]  My kids were in private school two years ago, three years ago.
[01:02:17.504 --> 01:02:19.146]  Half the week, like three days a week.
[01:02:20.046 --> 01:02:23.369]  One of those staggered homeschool private schools, a nice Christian private school, a big one.
[01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:34.959]  But they said, we're accredited, so, you know, these handouts would come home and these CDs from the federal department about, you know, with her telling you, you know, this is what you're supposed to eat.
[01:02:36.448 --> 01:02:40.571]  And it was like white bread and Lunchables and like GMO crap.
[01:02:41.732 --> 01:02:51.758]  I mean, you've all seen the photos online on Twitter of the young people fighting back and showing everybody what the school food looks like.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:03:00.024]  And it looks worse than the stuff you've seen in PBS documentaries, Inside Presence.
[01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:03.386]  I remember when I went to public school,
[01:03:04.932 --> 01:03:08.274]  You could eat healthy if you wanted to, but they had chicken fried steaks, they had salads, they had everything.
[01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:09.795]  It was pretty good food.
[01:03:09.815 --> 01:03:18.100]  In fact, my mouth just started watering thinking back to the school food we had when I was in Dallas.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:23.163]  And by the time I moved my last few years to Austin, the school food wasn't very good.
[01:03:23.243 --> 01:03:24.444]  And then now I see what it's like.
[01:03:26.311 --> 01:03:31.136]  And I've seen school food, I've been in some schools, and I mean, it is literally beyond prison food.
[01:03:31.577 --> 01:03:40.126]  A hamburger is like some weird, stale, fake bread buns with like a rotten tomato and a weird dehydrated pickle on it.
[01:03:41.347 --> 01:03:46.333]  And... I mean, it's just beyond gross, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:48.168 --> 01:03:49.429]  And it always tastes weird.
[01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:51.131]  They found some of the photos.
[01:03:51.151 --> 01:03:51.652]  That's nothing.
[01:03:51.692 --> 01:03:53.935]  I remember the blaze at them a few months ago.
[01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.677]  It was like, school lunch program.
[01:03:55.697 --> 01:03:56.498]  Would you eat this?
[01:03:56.578 --> 01:03:57.459]  Or worse than prisons?
[01:03:57.479 --> 01:03:58.019]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.561]  I mean, imagine.
[01:04:00.903 --> 01:04:02.765]  Imagine eating food that looks like that.
[01:04:02.785 --> 01:04:04.166]  It just, it's beyond prison.
[01:04:05.154 --> 01:04:07.816]  And I've been in jail, I don't know, four or five times protesting.
[01:04:08.517 --> 01:04:09.657]  And a couple times fighting.
[01:04:10.378 --> 01:04:11.679]  And never any convictions.
[01:04:12.399 --> 01:04:15.462]  But the cops show up and everybody's bloody, you know, everybody just goes to jail.
[01:04:16.222 --> 01:04:17.623]  And they let the courts sort it out.
[01:04:18.544 --> 01:04:22.367]  And I mean, I remember being in juvenile detention, I don't know, three times or so.
[01:04:23.888 --> 01:04:26.170]  And I remember the food was better than that right there.
[01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:33.275]  I remember being in Rockwall, Dallas and Terrell detention.
[01:04:35.485 --> 01:04:40.249]  And the food was better than what they serve kids in school right now.
[01:04:43.311 --> 01:04:48.094]  In fact, a couple times I was in jail, they would just bring you fast food.
[01:04:49.355 --> 01:04:52.137]  Which wasn't good for you, but I mean, you compare it to these school lunches.
[01:04:53.198 --> 01:04:55.379]  I mean, it looks like something out of a gulag.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:56.920]  But why not?
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.801]  Parents will put up with it.
[01:04:58.221 --> 01:04:59.642]  The sky is the limit, huh?
[01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:08.654]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:05:08.754 --> 01:05:10.916]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:05:11.096 --> 01:05:16.199]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:21.342]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:24.604]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:05:24.864 --> 01:05:28.726]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:05:28.946 --> 01:05:33.188]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:05:33.268 --> 01:05:43.314]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:05:43.494 --> 01:05:46.015]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:05:46.215 --> 01:05:54.258]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:58.380]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.303]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:04.443 --> 01:06:06.425]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[01:06:06.605 --> 01:06:12.590]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:17.795]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[01:06:17.855 --> 01:06:22.599]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[01:06:22.739 --> 01:06:27.263]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[01:06:27.563 --> 01:06:35.930]  The Infowars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:38.092]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:06:38.312 --> 01:06:45.418]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver.
[01:06:45.638 --> 01:06:52.207]  Using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage or your home kitchen.

[01:07:01.485 --> 01:07:02.285]  I don't know what it is.
[01:07:02.525 --> 01:07:04.266]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[01:07:04.386 --> 01:07:08.327]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[01:07:08.507 --> 01:07:09.727]  It's like I don't even exist.
[01:07:10.087 --> 01:07:11.908]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[01:07:12.048 --> 01:07:13.248]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:16.009]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[01:07:16.149 --> 01:07:21.390]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:26.471]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[01:07:26.611 --> 01:07:29.092]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:29.752]  Look it up.
[01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:36.696]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.
[01:07:36.876 --> 01:07:41.999]  Energize the man in your life with Super Male Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:42.139 --> 01:07:45.861]  It's designed to aid the body in ways that help invigorate your natural systems.
[01:07:46.041 --> 01:07:50.264]  Without artificial testosterone, completely free of GMOs, harmful additives,
[01:07:50.404 --> 01:07:54.647]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:54.767 --> 01:07:56.809]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.266 --> 01:08:18.967]  Drought concerns.
[01:08:19.307 --> 01:08:21.328]  They're very real in the American Southwest.
[01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:27.513]  And here in the state of Texas, many Texas cities and communities have less than 90 days of water in their reserve.
[01:08:27.693 --> 01:08:31.916]  And that's not even counting the water gouging that would surely take place during some type of crisis.
[01:08:32.376 --> 01:08:36.779]  Now there are reasonable water rationing measures in effect, such as using gray water.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.923]  Water from your sink or your bathtub that you store in a tank to water your grass at a later date.
[01:08:42.103 --> 01:08:43.224]  And that sounds perfectly fine.
[01:08:43.664 --> 01:08:49.190]  But there are more extreme measures not only being proposed, but also active in at least one Texas city.
[01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:54.595]  So in the name of sustainability, would you drink water that was once in your toilet?
[01:08:55.075 --> 01:08:57.738]  Can I ask you, what measures do you take to keep yourself hydrated?
[01:08:58.527 --> 01:08:59.147]  What measures?
[01:09:00.968 --> 01:09:07.990]  I drink a full glass of water every morning, a full glass of water before exercising, a full glass of water before bed, and water in between.
[01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.711]  I stop at most of the water fountains on the trail.
[01:09:10.931 --> 01:09:13.191]  Do you guys stop at the water fountains so you're drinking city water?
[01:09:13.672 --> 01:09:13.972]  Yes.
[01:09:14.632 --> 01:09:15.312]  And what type of water?
[01:09:15.332 --> 01:09:18.493]  Do you drink city water or some other type?
[01:09:18.673 --> 01:09:19.113]  City water.
[01:09:19.473 --> 01:09:24.435]  Okay, did you know that the city of Austin is considering making toilet water drinking water?
[01:09:24.875 --> 01:09:25.676]  That's disgusting.
[01:09:26.156 --> 01:09:26.757]  That's disgusting?
[01:09:26.777 --> 01:09:27.477]  That's disgusting.
[01:09:27.517 --> 01:09:28.979]  Would you drink the toilet water?
[01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:29.539]  No.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.361]  A city out in West Texas doing it.
[01:09:31.421 --> 01:09:32.882]  I think it's Big Spring, Texas.
[01:09:33.122 --> 01:09:34.324]  Yeah, yeah, I've heard of them doing it.
[01:09:34.344 --> 01:09:35.364]  I thought they were crazy for it.
[01:09:35.405 --> 01:09:36.786]  Do you let your dog drink out of the toilet?
[01:09:37.767 --> 01:09:37.947]  No.
[01:09:38.347 --> 01:09:38.507]  No?
[01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:40.869]  Okay, would you drink out of the toilet?
[01:09:41.830 --> 01:09:42.391]  What do you think?
[01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:48.211]  We're all going to have to answer that question soon, I guess, right?
[01:09:48.231 --> 01:09:48.771]  Right.
[01:09:48.831 --> 01:09:50.031]  Also, you've heard about this.
[01:09:50.131 --> 01:09:50.471]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:51.511]  You drink a lot of water.
[01:09:51.792 --> 01:09:55.852]  So, you know, you want to stay hydrated, you want to stay healthy, especially as it gets hotter here in the state of Texas.
[01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:59.273]  So, drinking your water morning, noon, and night, would you drink the toilet water?
[01:09:59.793 --> 01:10:00.194]  I would not.
[01:10:00.634 --> 01:10:02.294]  Could it ever be clean enough for you to drink it?
[01:10:04.455 --> 01:10:06.775]  Um, they would have to prove that it's clean enough.
[01:10:07.055 --> 01:10:10.016]  Would you consider drinking the water if you knew it was...no?
[01:10:10.176 --> 01:10:11.796]  No, not if any toilet water was in it.
[01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:14.757]  I'd want to hear more about it.
[01:10:15.453 --> 01:10:16.414]  How clean is clean?
[01:10:16.895 --> 01:10:17.916]  How clean would it have to be?
[01:10:20.358 --> 01:10:26.124]  It would have to be as clean as the water we drink now, and some people think our tap water's not clean enough now.
[01:10:26.144 --> 01:10:28.267]  They'd be fine.
[01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:30.128]  If I knew it was okay to drink, maybe.
[01:10:30.148 --> 01:10:30.649]  How would you know?
[01:10:30.689 --> 01:10:31.470]  How clean is clean?
[01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:32.371]  How clean would it have to be?
[01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:34.906]  Um, I don't know.
[01:10:35.286 --> 01:10:36.187]  That's a good question.
[01:10:36.387 --> 01:10:37.808]  Now, this is a last ditch effort.
[01:10:37.908 --> 01:10:44.533]  It's nothing that they so much want to do, but they're thinking that if the drought continues, it may get to the point where they have to drink the toilet water.
[01:10:44.553 --> 01:10:46.615]  So, could the water ever be clean enough?
[01:10:48.796 --> 01:10:50.337]  I don't... I don't think so.
[01:10:50.397 --> 01:10:52.139]  Why do we need to resort to that?
[01:10:52.399 --> 01:10:54.060]  Well, we have a water rationing in effect.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.182]  You know, there's a drought going on and... That.
[01:10:56.322 --> 01:10:57.162]  Yeah.
[01:10:57.182 --> 01:11:00.425]  So, you're saying it can never get to the point where you'd want to drink toilet water?
[01:11:01.408 --> 01:11:05.649]  It depends on the scientific process of what's used to purify it, you know?
[01:11:05.789 --> 01:11:12.111]  And I'll also tell you that here in the city of Austin, they fluoridate the water, and there have been Harvard studies about fluoride reducing people's IQs.
[01:11:13.252 --> 01:11:14.332]  I think I'm pretty smart still.
[01:11:14.532 --> 01:11:19.494]  Fluoride in the water, and the mayor of Austin, you know, gives you the finger if you come in there and talk about it.
[01:11:19.674 --> 01:11:22.315]  Oh, I try to talk to my family about it, and they just think I'm crazy.
[01:11:22.595 --> 01:11:26.116]  Harvard studies about fluoride reducing IQ levels.
[01:11:27.376 --> 01:11:29.137]  Well, I guess that explains a lot.
[01:11:30.011 --> 01:11:30.612]  All right, thank you.
[01:11:30.632 --> 01:11:31.473]  Enjoy your workout, miss.
[01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:32.213]  Thanks.
[01:11:33.695 --> 01:11:37.699]  The city of Big Spring, Texas is already taking water from the toilets to the tap.
[01:11:37.999 --> 01:11:45.007]  And through a multi-stage cleaning process, a representative for the Texas Water Development Board says it tastes just as good as any bottled water.
[01:11:46.457 --> 01:11:54.219]  It tasted not unlike any other drinking water, whether it's from the tap here in the City of Austin or bottled of Ozarka water.
[01:11:54.979 --> 01:11:56.219]  And yes, I'd recommend it.
[01:11:56.459 --> 01:12:00.560]  I recommend any water supply that is readily available and reliable and safe.
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:09.622]  So while the final decision concerning the toilet water may be a ways off, the City of Austin can improve health immediately by simply removing fluoride from the water.
[01:12:10.022 --> 01:12:12.883]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[01:12:13.732 --> 01:12:18.834]  Yeah, that may work for little creatures like my dog, but I'm not going to eat you.
[01:12:20.274 --> 01:12:23.135]  Texas town closed to toilet to tap loop.
[01:12:23.915 --> 01:12:25.536]  Is this our future water supply?
[01:12:25.556 --> 01:12:34.178]  And they go on to say that Austin has been doing such a good job saving water that we're not going to get toilet water recycled.
[01:12:34.719 --> 01:12:37.319]  And again, it's good to save water and not waste it.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.141]  But they just want you to not waste it to double, triple charge you.
[01:12:45.174 --> 01:12:48.196]  I wanted to intro the second hour with that Jakari Jackson piece.
[01:12:48.236 --> 01:12:53.719]  That's the type of reports you see every night, seven o'clock central with InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.541]  With stories that affect not just the U.S.
[01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:58.762]  or Texas, but the entire world.
[01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:04.586]  They want to put you in a 200 square foot apartment and charge you as much as a 2,000 square foot apartment.
[01:13:05.827 --> 01:13:13.792]  They want to put you in a tiny car and charge you $10 a gallon for gas, or the equivalent for coal power that's transferred into electricity.
[01:13:15.345 --> 01:13:19.407]  That's the model of Agenda 21, is artificial scarcity.
[01:13:19.727 --> 01:13:23.109]  And people better understand that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:23.949 --> 01:13:30.453]  Now, we are joined with a quick update by Paul Joseph Watson from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[01:13:31.593 --> 01:13:33.254]  Here in just a moment, we're going to go to him.
[01:13:33.714 --> 01:13:37.896]  And then I'm going to give the phone number out on a host of issues and cover some other news here in just a moment.
[01:13:37.916 --> 01:13:38.937]  So be ready for that.
[01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:43.404]  First off, Bilderberg 2014 is more important than ever.
[01:13:43.844 --> 01:13:58.975]  Last week, Paul Watson, from our sources, but also from public statements, Ender Spiegel, by one of the Bilderberg group members, admitting that they basically run the planet, that they're establishing a planetary regime, that they're more powerful than Davos.
[01:13:59.195 --> 01:14:01.057]  Davos is kind of one of their public events.
[01:14:03.419 --> 01:14:08.983]  That's why Prime Minister of England went there last year while I was covering it.
[01:14:10.014 --> 01:14:16.179]  While I was being detained by police for trying to rent a boat to go down the canal to get a shot of him there.
[01:14:16.699 --> 01:14:18.840]  We forced them to admit that he was an attendee.
[01:14:20.262 --> 01:14:27.067]  And that he violated different federal laws in England that you cannot have the Prime Minister meeting secretly at a lobbyist meeting.
[01:14:27.427 --> 01:14:28.267]  That's what this is.
[01:14:28.327 --> 01:14:30.209]  But they didn't want you to ever know it existed.
[01:14:32.105 --> 01:14:39.467]  I remember 10 years ago, they would have the New York Times literally say that we were insane, no such group existed.
[01:14:39.487 --> 01:14:43.648]  In fact, forget that.
[01:14:43.948 --> 01:14:54.310]  In 2009, the New York Times reviewed a film called The New World Order that aired on the independent film channel that I was in, and they literally said Mr. Jones had a full-on schizophrenic break.
[01:14:55.970 --> 01:15:02.976]  Total break with reality and was in the woods in Virginia imagining sedans and men in black glasses and a secret meeting.
[01:15:03.036 --> 01:15:04.257]  And they said there was no meeting.
[01:15:05.498 --> 01:15:11.182]  Now we had footage of Marines, we had footage of helicopters, Secret Service, turned out Hillary and Obama were in the meeting years later.
[01:15:11.463 --> 01:15:13.705]  That was their secret meeting when no one could find Obama for a day.
[01:15:15.506 --> 01:15:15.966]  It was there.
[01:15:16.427 --> 01:15:16.807]  It happened.
[01:15:16.847 --> 01:15:22.532]  We caught world leaders with their national anthems playing and they just came out in the New York Times and said it didn't exist.
[01:15:23.902 --> 01:15:26.183]  Just like they say, if you have a business, you didn't build that.
[01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:30.706]  Just like they say that raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit.
[01:15:31.446 --> 01:15:36.609]  Just like they say there is no $5,000 fine starting this year for people that don't get Obamacare.
[01:15:36.749 --> 01:15:37.690]  It's in the stinking bill.
[01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:40.051]  Everyone will be affected next year.
[01:15:42.012 --> 01:15:42.992]  They just say there is no fee.
[01:15:43.473 --> 01:15:44.413]  There are no death panels.
[01:15:46.274 --> 01:15:47.295]  You will keep your doctor.
[01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:51.217]  It will lower your bill to the price of a phone bill or a cable bill.
[01:15:53.351 --> 01:15:56.092]  I guess if you've got 10 different cable packages, maybe.
[01:15:57.293 --> 01:15:59.213]  Maybe you own a small hotel and pay for 10 packages?
[01:15:59.253 --> 01:15:59.573]  Maybe, yeah.
[01:16:00.794 --> 01:16:01.294]  But not one.
[01:16:02.014 --> 01:16:03.755]  It's doubling prices, conservatively.
[01:16:04.996 --> 01:16:05.876]  This is what we deal with.
[01:16:05.896 --> 01:16:06.396]  Well, guess what?
[01:16:06.496 --> 01:16:10.818]  Now, thanks to InfoWars.com, WorldNetDaily.com, DrugsReport.com.
[01:16:12.998 --> 01:16:17.740]  The Epoch Times, they helped break it as well in the last decade.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.640]  American Free Press and others.
[01:16:20.381 --> 01:16:23.622]  Because of that fact, they now have to admit it exists.
[01:16:23.942 --> 01:16:25.643]  But they go, it's no big deal.
[01:16:25.943 --> 01:16:27.523]  Yeah, it's world leaders meeting a secret.
[01:16:28.043 --> 01:16:30.544]  Royalty, bankers, head of Google.
[01:16:30.584 --> 01:16:31.445]  But don't worry about it.
[01:16:31.885 --> 01:16:33.005]  It's kooky to even care.
[01:16:33.765 --> 01:16:35.446]  Let me tell you what happened last year in England.
[01:16:35.786 --> 01:16:36.526]  You've seen the video.
[01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:40.188]  About 3,000 people showed up to hear me speak.
[01:16:41.255 --> 01:16:50.200]  On the green there, the police told us they were listeners and didn't like Bilderberg, and we're not lying, and rolled the red carpet out for us in most cases.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.501]  There were a few that were jerks, low-level ones.
[01:16:54.703 --> 01:16:56.324]  But I've never been treated so well by police.
[01:16:57.984 --> 01:16:59.505]  And they gave us intel.
[01:16:59.685 --> 01:17:04.048]  Well, regional police came and met with us and were nice, and then local police were nice.
[01:17:04.588 --> 01:17:07.210]  I ran into some guys from MI5, gave us really good intel.
[01:17:08.654 --> 01:17:10.854]  And they just said, point blank, no, we know this is horrible for our country.
[01:17:10.894 --> 01:17:11.655]  We know it's bad, yeah.
[01:17:12.455 --> 01:17:14.095]  We're allowed to have opinions as citizens.
[01:17:14.115 --> 01:17:14.675]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:17:14.795 --> 01:17:15.755]  It's illegal, we believe.
[01:17:17.596 --> 01:17:18.876]  People don't want to be slaves, folks.
[01:17:19.196 --> 01:17:26.017]  You've got a working class attitude in England where people still understand, especially those that aren't dumb, that having a bunch of insiders meet is bad for everybody.
[01:17:26.577 --> 01:17:28.138]  And set agendas in secret.
[01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:29.278]  And it's illegal.
[01:17:30.058 --> 01:17:31.358]  So, we've come a long way.
[01:17:31.378 --> 01:17:33.479]  I'm going to skip this network break so we can talk to Paul Watson.
[01:17:33.499 --> 01:17:34.659]  Give the number out and take your calls.
[01:17:37.369 --> 01:17:39.132]  Bilderberg 2014 is a big deal.
[01:17:39.873 --> 01:17:42.096]  Because we just got the internal list.
[01:17:42.597 --> 01:17:45.240]  It's going up right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:17:45.421 --> 01:17:48.765]  And we're going to add photos, documents, and intel to the bottom of it.
[01:17:48.805 --> 01:17:50.308]  But we have the 2014 list.
[01:17:50.688 --> 01:17:53.292]  It's going up at InfoWars.com in mere minutes.
[01:17:54.213 --> 01:17:55.014]  In mere minutes.
[01:17:55.414 --> 01:18:00.738]  Joining us from Copenhagen tomorrow, he'll be on with us via video Skype, 30 minutes into the show.
[01:18:01.479 --> 01:18:07.964]  And if there's any big events or any attempts to stop our reporters, he'll be doing live feeds as well on Ustream and other systems.
[01:18:08.344 --> 01:18:10.886]  Paul, give us an update since you got there yesterday.
[01:18:11.627 --> 01:18:17.191]  Were you able to get into the hotel or are you banned as I was in England and as you were in England?
[01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:18.652]  Give us the data dump.
[01:18:18.692 --> 01:18:20.934]  Paul Watson reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:18:22.475 --> 01:18:23.516]  Hi Alex, good to be back.
[01:18:23.836 --> 01:18:30.120]  Yeah, I've actually checked into the Marriott right now, and they've blocked off the second floor of the hotel.
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:40.226]  There's a rope around the stairs in the lobby, and if you take the elevator up to the second floor, you're quickly escorted back into the elevator.
[01:18:40.266 --> 01:18:46.510]  So, they've let us in this time, which differs obviously from last year where we were kicked out three days beforehand.
[01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:51.373]  We were told that we were a security threat at Watford last year at the Grove.
[01:18:52.153 --> 01:18:59.996]  This year, they've let us check in, but preparations are already very visibly taking place to build the boat 2014.
[01:19:00.136 --> 01:19:07.019]  The security is extremely paranoid for as much as half a mile surrounding the entire hotel.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.701]  But we've checked into the Marriott.
[01:19:09.741 --> 01:19:11.761]  We're here reporting from the scene.
[01:19:12.962 --> 01:19:15.023]  It's now gone up on InfoWars.com.
[01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:19.645]  We have the official 2014 list that went up literally minutes ago.
[01:19:20.615 --> 01:19:29.399]  On the official Bilderberg meetings website, which again they didn't have until six years ago, under massive pressure, they have been forced to let some of this out.
[01:19:29.819 --> 01:19:35.822]  Official Bilderberg 2014 membership list released, official list on this year's Bilderberg attendees.
[01:19:37.026 --> 01:19:37.447]  I think so.
[01:19:58.089 --> 01:20:00.571]  And then we have your latest article reposted under it, Paul.
[01:20:01.232 --> 01:20:12.541]  And we're going to make note of that, that you have been able, from your sources, to find out what they're really concerned with this year and what is going to be on their agenda and what the main focus is.
[01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:17.865]  But, Paul, obviously shoot video of them throwing you off the elevator.
[01:20:18.266 --> 01:20:20.567]  I'd come out with your iPhone rolling and put that on YouTube.
[01:20:21.488 --> 01:20:22.629]  How is Ustream working?
[01:20:22.969 --> 01:20:25.872]  Give us a little preview of what you're going to be able to do inside the hotel.
[01:20:28.979 --> 01:20:44.742]  Well, the fact that they've let us in is a big surprise because as far as half a mile away, right across the border, the police are going around to the local ice cream sellers and telling them to watch out for suspicious people walking next to the border.
[01:20:45.403 --> 01:20:48.763]  So, they've done it a little bit differently, at least they're letting us in.
[01:20:49.143 --> 01:20:56.525]  But you can tell that, you know, compared to Watford last year, the security setup is very more paranoid.
[01:20:57.384 --> 01:20:58.625]  We're inside the hotel.
[01:20:58.665 --> 01:21:00.387]  They've roped off the second floor.
[01:21:00.987 --> 01:21:04.390]  The organizers for the actual conference are already here.
[01:21:05.051 --> 01:21:06.172]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:21:06.572 --> 01:21:08.353]  Used to, they threw you out Thursday morning.
[01:21:08.373 --> 01:21:09.855]  They threw you out arriving Thursday evening.
[01:21:11.176 --> 01:21:14.619]  Now, when I get there, even three days before, they're just, Alex Jones, you're not allowed here.
[01:21:14.939 --> 01:21:15.580]  The police are there.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.320]  They throw us out.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.242]  They go to the local hotel where we're staying.
[01:21:18.282 --> 01:21:19.463]  Say, don't give this guy service.
[01:21:19.803 --> 01:21:21.585]  We caught that on tape in Virginia last year.
[01:21:22.734 --> 01:21:23.935]  I'm surprised because
[01:21:42.226 --> 01:21:48.947]  Outside, you know, the entrance to the hotel, there were tourists with cameras who weren't even taking pictures.
[01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:59.709]  They just had, you know, Canon cameras slung around their backs and security people were walking up to them and being very domineering and saying, you're not allowed to take pictures.
[01:21:59.729 --> 01:22:01.029]  Well, Watson, let's just say it.
[01:22:01.489 --> 01:22:04.830]  You're like six foot three and you look extremely aristocratic.
[01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:08.611]  So, I mean, no, I mean, you look like a model in person.
[01:22:08.651 --> 01:22:09.931]  So that's why you're being left alone.
[01:22:11.511 --> 01:22:11.952]  No, I know.
[01:22:11.992 --> 01:22:12.972]  That's why you're being left alone.
[01:22:13.052 --> 01:22:13.352]  I know.
[01:22:14.073 --> 01:22:14.453]  Exactly.
[01:22:14.493 --> 01:22:18.015]  That's what's going on.
[01:22:18.555 --> 01:22:23.257]  Yeah, I mean, they're walking up to people who aren't even taking pictures and harassing them.
[01:22:23.817 --> 01:22:35.923]  And even right across the border, they're talking to the local tradesmen and the people who own the boats that sail right by the hotel and trying to intimidate them out of, you know, taking protesters on board.
[01:22:35.943 --> 01:22:38.745]  There's still a chance that we might be able to do that, but we'll wait and see.
[01:22:39.465 --> 01:22:40.026]  Yeah, basically.
[01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:11.877]  Obviously one side of the Marriott faces out onto the water streaming through and the other side, you know, faces out onto the industrial sector in the rest of the city.
[01:23:12.657 --> 01:23:21.244]  There's a bridge that connects the Marriott and there are people with microphones patrolling that bridge on a regular basis.
[01:23:21.344 --> 01:23:23.805]  I saw that from the hotel room a little bit earlier.
[01:23:24.726 --> 01:23:28.609]  They actually upgraded my hotel room to a waterfront view so that was nice of them.
[01:23:29.602 --> 01:23:32.425]  Well, Watson, I want you to get on that boat.
[01:23:33.546 --> 01:23:36.970]  I want you to get on those boats and get footage from the water of the facility.
[01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:42.436]  Are they putting up a fence, a makeshift riot fence, like they did in Watford last year in England?
[01:23:44.130 --> 01:23:45.411]  They're doing that tomorrow.
[01:23:45.832 --> 01:23:52.378]  I've been told the space that the police have afforded us is very near the hotel compared to last year.
[01:23:52.438 --> 01:23:53.739]  It's literally across the road.
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:59.865]  The fences that are in place now are there permanently, so you can see through them.
[01:23:59.905 --> 01:24:00.726]  That's no big deal.
[01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.488]  But they're going to put bollards up.
[01:24:02.508 --> 01:24:04.950]  They're going to erect a fence tomorrow.
[01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:07.513]  I've been told immediately in front of that
[01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:25.634]  parking lot area which is being afforded to the protesters and then there are separate areas near the hotel that have been given to us though and I'm here with Charlie Skelton and Hannah who can talk to you as well about the preparations.
[01:24:29.758 --> 01:24:35.901]  Now, Watson, again, we had incredible mega-thunderstorms covering half the state yesterday, literally.
[01:24:36.281 --> 01:24:38.522]  So the flights were all canceled out of Houston.
[01:24:39.102 --> 01:24:44.705]  To get our reporters out there to you, David Knight and Josh Owens, they'll be there tonight.
[01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:47.749]  Yeah, the thing about the staff is
[01:25:10.598 --> 01:25:13.499]  They're obviously very reluctant to tell us anything.
[01:25:13.539 --> 01:25:17.121]  We've already tried to talk to them and it's basically a complete lockdown.
[01:25:17.981 --> 01:25:21.162]  But as I said, we're going to get nearer than we did last year.
[01:25:21.843 --> 01:25:26.125]  We're here until tomorrow early afternoon, which is when we have to check out.
[01:25:26.185 --> 01:25:32.667]  So basically we got the rest of today and tomorrow morning and we're getting closer access than we did last year.
[01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:37.789]  So hopefully we're going to get more inside information compared to last year.
[01:25:39.963 --> 01:26:03.148]  But as I said, it's a whole lot more paranoid than it was last time around because they've allowed us in, but I'm looking at the stairs up to the second floor, they've put a red rope across it, they've blocked it off, they've got people guarding it, they've got people outside the front of the hotel harassing tourists, simply carrying cameras, they're not even taking photographs.
[01:26:03.668 --> 01:26:09.089]  I'm looking at the actual attendee list, you know, you've got Rasmussen there from NATO, so as I said in the article earlier,
[01:26:09.696 --> 01:26:17.440]  They're extremely concerned about this agenda for the unipolar world falling apart, which obviously centers around Putin and Ukraine.
[01:26:17.841 --> 01:26:22.043]  We've had top globalists saying that Russia is basically being kicked out of the New World Order.
[01:26:22.063 --> 01:26:29.607]  You've got the revolution in Europe with the anti-EU parties winning the Euro elections in the UK, Denmark and France.
[01:26:29.647 --> 01:26:32.929]  So this is absolutely crucial for Bilderberg.
[01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:37.552]  This is probably one of the most crucial meetings since
[01:26:48.877 --> 01:26:51.198]  Absolutely, we'd love to talk to Charlie Skelton.
[01:26:51.659 --> 01:26:52.680]  Let's do that right now.
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:54.401]  Again, we have to give the Guardian credit.
[01:26:54.881 --> 01:26:59.385]  In the last eight years or so, they've been covering it and not just making jokes about it.
[01:27:00.125 --> 01:27:02.367]  Charlie's been arrested, you name it, repeatedly.
[01:27:03.929 --> 01:27:08.835]  But he did a great job in England last year helping organize so much of it with his wife, the actual protest.
[01:27:09.135 --> 01:27:10.217]  So you gotta love that.
[01:27:10.297 --> 01:27:12.359]  Guardian writer helping organize the protest.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.402]  Charlie Skelton, thank you for joining us.
[01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:16.645]  What's your breakdown on what you're seeing, sir?
[01:27:18.294 --> 01:27:24.197]  Well, I'm staring now at the participant list, which seems to be a very powerful Bilderberg this year.
[01:27:24.217 --> 01:27:26.218]  I mean, they're always powerful, but this seems to be a big one.
[01:27:27.059 --> 01:27:39.526]  You know, the head of MI6, the head of NATO, the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe are here, and they're interestingly here with people like General Petraeus, who now works for Henry Kravitz at KKR.
[01:27:39.746 --> 01:27:41.927]  Now, KKR is a big speculator on war.
[01:27:42.368 --> 01:27:43.628]  You know, that's where they make their money.
[01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:46.539]  They're not the nicest people in the world.
[01:27:46.899 --> 01:27:56.504]  Anyway, they're going to be, I guess, discussing some of the things going on geopolitically, and we'll be standing nearby taking photographs of them as they arrive in the limousine.
[01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:57.405]  Or trying to.
[01:27:58.165 --> 01:28:02.628]  Now, I was thrown out with Watson two days before it began in Watford last year.
[01:28:02.648 --> 01:28:07.911]  We were in a restaurant, actually, and they came in and said, you know, get up and leave, and I just kept eating and finished my wine.
[01:28:08.551 --> 01:28:09.692]  But long story short,
[01:28:11.983 --> 01:28:17.276]  How are you guys able to get in if they're even telling tourists 300 yards outside the facility not to take photos?
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:36.625]  Well, you know, I mean, it's a kind of slightly fluid situation and, you know, we're here, we're going to go for dinner here, I hope, and just have a nice time and soak up the extremely expensive atmosphere and then worry about the cost tomorrow.
[01:28:37.765 --> 01:28:47.188]  But it's, you know, it's still winding up and it will wind up now for the next few days until, you know, obviously reaches on Thursday the sort of peak of
[01:28:48.388 --> 01:29:00.260]  The security and it's a big operation and the location is just a couple of hundred yards from the main administrative centre of the Copenhagen Police.
[01:29:01.081 --> 01:29:05.186]  So in some ways it's interesting that they're holding it right in the middle of a city.
[01:29:05.866 --> 01:29:10.190]  So, you know, good for people that want to come and say hello, take some photos, report on it.
[01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:12.452]  But also, you know, right next to the police station.
[01:29:12.492 --> 01:29:15.915]  So, I think it should be, you know, it's a sunny day today.
[01:29:15.955 --> 01:29:17.456]  I think it should be a good build of it.
[01:29:17.476 --> 01:29:23.982]  I mean, obviously, it's missing your presence, sailing down a barge, bullhorning, which is a memory I won't forget in a hurry.
[01:29:25.123 --> 01:29:28.806]  But, you know, we've got Paul Joseph Watson here, so that's a good second best.
[01:29:28.886 --> 01:29:30.188]  Well, you're going to kick butt.
[01:29:30.268 --> 01:29:31.369]  Is your wife there as well?
[01:29:32.429 --> 01:29:33.249]  Yes, he is here.
[01:29:33.809 --> 01:29:38.930]  I want to come back, Charlie, and do two or three more minutes with you to get other observations.
[01:29:39.411 --> 01:29:41.351]  Where's the best place for people to read your reportage?
[01:29:41.391 --> 01:29:43.572]  Is it at the London Guardian or your personal website?
[01:29:44.492 --> 01:29:45.372]  It'll be on the Guardian, yeah.
[01:29:46.192 --> 01:29:48.633]  I want to hear about when we can start seeing some reports and photos.
[01:29:48.653 --> 01:29:49.593]  You always take great photos.
[01:29:49.633 --> 01:29:50.413]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.853 --> 01:29:51.813]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.293 --> 01:29:53.834]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.874 --> 01:29:54.274]  Bilderberg 2014.
[01:29:54.814 --> 01:29:57.295]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.315 --> 01:29:58.855]  We're going to find out who's not on that list.
[01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:04.172]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:09.314]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:30:09.555 --> 01:30:17.439]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:21.982]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:30:22.222 --> 01:30:26.024]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:30:26.164 --> 01:30:31.886]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:34.886]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:30:35.286 --> 01:30:40.508]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:48.230]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist.

[01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:05.291]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:31:05.311 --> 01:31:09.472]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:31:09.712 --> 01:31:13.113]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:31:13.354 --> 01:31:16.235]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:31:16.395 --> 01:31:23.778]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:31:23.958 --> 01:31:27.599]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:31:27.859 --> 01:31:32.120]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:38.222]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:31:38.262 --> 01:31:42.022]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:31:42.182 --> 01:31:44.743]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:31:44.943 --> 01:31:46.283]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:31:46.443 --> 01:31:47.684]  It's time to take action.
[01:31:47.804 --> 01:31:49.524]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:32:00.347 --> 01:32:04.489]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:04.649 --> 01:32:06.589]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[01:32:06.789 --> 01:32:12.771]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[01:32:12.972 --> 01:32:17.953]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:22.775]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[01:32:22.915 --> 01:32:25.736]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives.
[01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:36.147]  The Infowars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:32:36.347 --> 01:32:38.289]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:32:38.489 --> 01:32:45.637]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver.
[01:32:45.817 --> 01:32:47.417]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:32:47.498 --> 01:32:51.119]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:21.511]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.433 --> 01:33:40.796]  The real global mafia is meeting right now in Copenhagen, Denmark, protected by state-run media, protected by the state and taxpayers' money.
[01:33:40.816 --> 01:33:43.377]  And they're not being protected from physical harm,
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:48.283]  They're being protected mainly from the harm of the bright lights of publicity.
[01:33:49.263 --> 01:33:57.689]  And Charlie Skelton writes for The Guardian and its sister newspaper, The Observer, and his stories have been widely circulated.
[01:33:57.709 --> 01:34:03.133]  Probably the top coverage of the last five, six, seven years of Bilderberg has been at The Guardian.
[01:34:03.493 --> 01:34:04.173]  Much of it his.
[01:34:04.214 --> 01:34:04.874]  That's a big deal.
[01:34:05.394 --> 01:34:11.038]  There's a reason The Guardian's number one in Europe, not just in England, and it's because it covers globalism.
[01:34:11.138 --> 01:34:12.199]  It covers the New World Order.
[01:34:12.259 --> 01:34:13.280]  It covers real stories.
[01:34:14.511 --> 01:34:16.373]  It covers the NSA whistleblowers.
[01:34:17.994 --> 01:34:20.036]  And they've been threatening to arrest members of the Guardian.
[01:34:20.076 --> 01:34:22.218]  So I've got to give it credit where it's due.
[01:34:23.038 --> 01:34:30.424]  DrugsReport.com has linked to the official Bilderberg 2014 attendee list that we have mirrored from their site.
[01:34:30.925 --> 01:34:36.910]  We're also going to add to the bottom of it, yesterday they released the official agenda, which I can assure you will not be the real agenda being covered.
[01:34:37.961 --> 01:34:42.889]  Because they'll have these official meetings and then the little breakaways is where the real criminal stuff's going on.
[01:34:42.909 --> 01:34:46.394]  By the way, mainstream British news last year said it was illegal.
[01:34:46.955 --> 01:34:49.519]  I mean, they are setting policy in secret.
[01:34:50.621 --> 01:34:58.706]  Going back to Charlie Skelton, I know you'll have a lot more tomorrow and throughout the weekend we'll have live coverage again Sunday as it all ends on the Sunday broadcast as well.
[01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:07.110]  I may even just have David Knight and Paul Watson, if the Skype is good, host the Sunday show with myself just calling in so I don't dominate the discussion.
[01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:10.392]  I have to kind of exclude myself or wild horses can't drag me away.
[01:35:10.432 --> 01:35:15.735]  But other points you think are important or other observations, Charlie Skelton?
[01:35:17.133 --> 01:35:22.322]  Well, from the agenda, I would definitely, I mean, whether they're discussing this, they're certainly saying that.
[01:35:22.342 --> 01:35:24.285]  They're discussing the question, does privacy exist?
[01:35:24.938 --> 01:35:29.580]  Which, you know, for an organisation that values privacy as much as Bilderberg does, it's a curious question.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:42.665]  But it's interesting that they're discussing privacy with, you know, the Executive Chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, and the head of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, and people like Alex Karp from Palantir Technologies.
[01:35:43.026 --> 01:35:48.608]  So these are kind of big players in the new media and that world.
[01:35:48.708 --> 01:35:53.230]  So, you know, in a world where, you know, we, the people, are extremely transparent.
[01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:58.852]  It's interesting that they would ask, does privacy exist, and it's a question everyone should actually be asking.
[01:35:58.872 --> 01:36:08.895]  Perhaps not in the way they're asking, because their idea of privacy and ours probably differ, and the importance of privacy probably differs.
[01:36:08.955 --> 01:36:14.797]  But I think that's interesting that privacy in a post-Snowden world is at the centre of the Bilderberg discussion.
[01:36:17.401 --> 01:36:22.063]  Well, I think you make a really good point there, that these guys are just such hypocrites on every front.
[01:36:22.183 --> 01:36:26.264]  Schmidt, who's a frequent attendee, the head of Google, he wants to be secret.
[01:36:27.144 --> 01:36:35.387]  He had YouTube take down videos that we posted of him hiking up the mountain a few years ago in Switzerland, then they put him back up later when there was protest.
[01:36:35.427 --> 01:36:39.688]  I just don't get how they want to live in one world and then we live in another.
[01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:41.689]  Why don't they just want everybody to be free?
[01:36:41.729 --> 01:36:44.490]  I just don't get how they think they're important but we're not.
[01:36:45.589 --> 01:36:56.671]  Well I know, you know, you end up with a slightly Hunger Games division of society as the Bilderbergians zoom through the ghettos.
[01:36:56.711 --> 01:36:58.612]  You know what I mean?
[01:36:58.652 --> 01:37:01.732]  Obviously there's a double standard at play.
[01:37:01.973 --> 01:37:11.955]  When you're being held in a sort of police pen pointing a zoom lens at a group of world leaders, which includes people like the head of the IMF and two ministers from the UK.
[01:37:14.536 --> 01:37:15.556]  And a shadow minister as well.
[01:37:16.237 --> 01:37:18.398]  So these are politicians, there's a lot of politicians here.
[01:37:18.418 --> 01:37:24.902]  If you look at the list you'll see the number of elected officials, sorry, elected public servants here.
[01:37:25.322 --> 01:37:26.383]  You know, it's staggering.
[01:37:26.543 --> 01:37:31.766]  And, you know, where are the minutes from the meeting?
[01:37:31.787 --> 01:37:33.588]  You know, there are questions like that people should be asking.
[01:37:33.628 --> 01:37:41.072]  You know, this is a meeting where a three-day conference, you know, Chancellor of the Exchequer, the head of the Treasury in the UK, is going to be here for three days.
[01:37:41.132 --> 01:37:41.953]  It's probably his biggest
[01:37:43.812 --> 01:37:45.393]  You know, engagement of the year, officially.
[01:37:45.633 --> 01:37:47.553]  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if it is.
[01:37:48.253 --> 01:37:54.615]  And, you know, if that's happening, and if there are so many politicians, we need better coverage from the mainstream media.
[01:37:54.975 --> 01:37:56.575]  It's improving, certainly, but we need more.
[01:37:56.876 --> 01:38:00.857]  And we need more transparency from the politicians who attend.
[01:38:01.077 --> 01:38:02.797]  You know, that seems, I think, reasonable.
[01:38:02.817 --> 01:38:08.519]  And that's a double standard I think we can explode within the media generally, and hopefully.
[01:38:08.979 --> 01:38:09.299]  I say that.
[01:38:09.679 --> 01:38:10.179]  I'm an optimist.
[01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:12.229]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:38:12.249 --> 01:38:17.391]  I mean, I remember, again, five years ago, they wouldn't admit that the stock markets are rigged and that the interest rates are rigged.
[01:38:17.731 --> 01:38:21.052]  Now even Rolling Stone admits it and everything is rigged.
[01:38:21.352 --> 01:38:22.813]  The biggest price-fixing scandal ever.
[01:38:23.113 --> 01:38:23.933]  Look at LIBOR.
[01:38:24.293 --> 01:38:26.594]  Look at the big European banks, and the U.S.
[01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:35.017]  is doing it as well, fixing interest rates to screw the general public, where the elite get basically free interest, we have to pay interest, even if we have good credit.
[01:38:36.028 --> 01:38:56.356]  Rigging things is a big deal, and we're there showing where it's being rigged, and it's just simply amazing that we have forced the bigger establishment-aligned media to cover this, because believe me, folks, a decade ago, if mainstream media covered Bilderberg, you would lose your job.
[01:38:56.696 --> 01:39:03.639]  Charlie Skelton, thank you so much for the time, and you can hand that back over to Paul Watson, and I can't wait to see your reporting at the London Guardian.
[01:39:05.942 --> 01:39:17.833]  All right, final comments from Paul Watson, and then I'm going to go to your phone calls and cover Second Amendment news, economic news, the First Lady controlling what's on our school lunch menu news.
[01:39:18.213 --> 01:39:19.975]  She's going to respond to critics now.
[01:39:20.615 --> 01:39:23.538]  How dare you want to be able to have your kid eat what you want?
[01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:27.541]  Well, under their rules at Chicago schools, you're not allowed to pack lunch.
[01:39:27.642 --> 01:39:28.422]  She decides.
[01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:30.204]  And it's going to go nationwide now.
[01:39:32.179 --> 01:39:35.142]  That's like North Korea, again, where Kim Jong-un decides what people eat.
[01:39:35.223 --> 01:39:36.544]  I mean, I just can't handle it, folks.
[01:39:37.065 --> 01:39:48.017]  This is authoritarianism, and we're going to expose who pulls the strings on Michelle Obama, and who pulls the strings on David Cameron, and who pulls the strings on Angela Merkel.
[01:39:49.139 --> 01:39:51.862]  Paul Watson, any other comments that you think are important?
[01:39:55.133 --> 01:40:20.598]  I would emphasize that we need to post the agenda which is also on the Bilderberg meetings website as well as the list because they've announced the agenda and aside from some very interesting other discussion topics listed are Ukraine and the future of Europe, what's next for Europe which obviously in the article I posted earlier today Ukraine and Europe were the main focus obviously you have
[01:40:21.932 --> 01:40:27.855]  Mr. Messerschmitt, Morten Messerschmitt, who won the Euro elections in Denmark.
[01:40:27.875 --> 01:40:33.598]  You have Nigel Farage for UKIP in the United Kingdom, and you have Marine Le Pen in France.
[01:40:33.638 --> 01:40:38.340]  So there's this kind of far-right, the media calls it, revolution.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.001]  It's really Libertarian Tea Party.
[01:40:40.041 --> 01:40:42.883]  We know Pen, we know Farage, we know them all.
[01:40:42.923 --> 01:40:44.284]  They're all Ron Paul fans.
[01:40:44.364 --> 01:40:47.005]  Le Pen was good buddies with Bob Chapman on record.
[01:40:47.505 --> 01:40:50.367]  These are Libertarian listeners of this show.
[01:40:51.167 --> 01:40:52.188]  You have common sense.
[01:40:52.228 --> 01:40:57.153]  Look at the Tea Party sweeping in primaries all over the US.
[01:40:57.433 --> 01:41:04.059]  The globalists are concerned, and they were concerned in 2006 about the quote Liberty Movement and Ron Paul.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.462]  We got that directly from Bilderberg in 2006.
[01:41:06.842 --> 01:41:09.484]  An Estillan source, I happen to know who it is,
[01:41:10.615 --> 01:41:11.375]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:41:11.775 --> 01:41:12.916]  I'll just say it's a major banker.
[01:41:12.936 --> 01:41:15.297]  I mean, the system knows who it is.
[01:41:16.397 --> 01:41:22.440]  But the point is, they're going to implode the housing market to bankrupt the American people in 2008.
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:29.903]  We reported that two years before on video with Estalin in a bar two miles from the Bilderberg meeting.
[01:41:30.143 --> 01:41:31.163]  His sources are real.
[01:41:31.443 --> 01:41:32.644]  He's coming up in the next hour.
[01:41:33.464 --> 01:41:34.945]  So how big a deal is that?
[01:41:37.119 --> 01:41:38.119]  I mean, it's a massive deal.
[01:41:38.299 --> 01:41:43.881]  Obviously, you mentioned the German magazine article a week ago saying that Bilderberg is more powerful than Davos.
[01:41:43.921 --> 01:41:54.964]  You have NATO Secretary General Willy Klaas from Belgium in 2010 saying that Bilderberg has a mandate to implement the decisions in their relative spheres of influence.
[01:41:55.625 --> 01:41:59.666]  Then we have this topic on the agenda, which is who will pay for the demographics?
[01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:08.077]  Now, to me that appears as if it's not a monetary sense who will pay for the demographics, it's the cultural and the social identity.
[01:42:08.257 --> 01:42:09.899]  That's the price that people are going to pay.
[01:42:10.419 --> 01:42:17.105]  Obviously, this conservative revolution is based on anti-immigration policies throughout Europe.
[01:42:17.766 --> 01:42:19.628]  People are really getting behind that in Europe.
[01:42:20.345 --> 01:42:40.053]  Because they're bringing in giant masses of people, giving them free welfare, making them the new social workers, and the government is literally overthrowing all existing liberty with the giant third world desperate populations, who we have nothing against, but, you know, literally this is an overwrite and an extermination of Western culture.
[01:42:41.673 --> 01:42:50.302]  No, and we talked to Danes earlier and they were very clear that mass immigration was a problem, but that it was not the immigrants fault, it was being pushed from above.
[01:42:50.843 --> 01:42:59.452]  So then you also have discussions about China's increasing power, Ukraine, what's next for Europe, and talk of demographics and immigration.
[01:43:00.552 --> 01:43:08.075]  The three core issues that we identified this morning in the report on InforWars.com are being discussed at Bilderberg.
[01:43:08.896 --> 01:43:14.978]  Ukraine obviously with Putin, top globalist, saying that Russia is now officially being kicked out of the New World Order.
[01:43:15.018 --> 01:43:17.900]  Of course, it's kicked out of the G8, which has now become the G7.
[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:20.721]  So you can go down the line.
[01:43:20.741 --> 01:43:30.065]  They've got intelligence officials here from Britain, several other people that are talking about how special is the relationship in intelligence sharing, they're saying.
[01:43:30.726 --> 01:43:32.247]  Does privacy exist?
[01:43:32.468 --> 01:43:34.730]  That's one of the other topics for discussion.
[01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:43.357]  So, this is absolutely crucial, 2014, the convergence of global geopolitical economic development.
[01:43:44.038 --> 01:43:49.883]  And this key meeting, which as we said is more powerful than Davos, that's not us saying that, that's Bilderberg members saying that.
[01:43:50.589 --> 01:43:57.653]  So this is really a crucial fissure in the set of the march towards world government.
[01:43:57.713 --> 01:44:02.856]  It's in very severe danger of collapse, which has been illustrated by the Euro election results.
[01:44:03.196 --> 01:44:06.058]  And notice their website looks like the State Department website.
[01:44:06.378 --> 01:44:10.461]  That's because if you look at 1954, with the former Nazis and others in the West,
[01:44:11.061 --> 01:44:16.486]  You had British intelligence, the State Department, and all of them setting up the first Bilderberg.
[01:44:16.526 --> 01:44:19.368]  They now admit they created the secret European Union.
[01:44:19.668 --> 01:44:21.330]  They've created the secret American Union.
[01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:27.054]  We're already in this, and now they're bragging about it to major German magazines.
[01:44:27.155 --> 01:44:34.561]  Why do you think, on one side they deny any of this is happening, but on the other side they throw it in our face they're doing it?
[01:44:36.431 --> 01:44:48.774]  Because the minority of people aren't into this kind of stuff and they don't read the news, they don't read books, they don't read anything, so on the face of it they can justify it by saying it's just a private gathering for the media.
[01:44:49.695 --> 01:45:01.398]  But as we know, when the specific topics are released and we see that they mesh with global geopolitical development, then it brings it to light that
[01:45:02.208 --> 01:45:06.133]  This is the center of the New World Order engine room.
[01:45:06.393 --> 01:45:10.698]  This is the core of the agenda, as has been admitted by Bilderberg members.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:18.407]  And the question is, are we bad as journalists for wanting to see what they're talking about and what they're keeping secret?
[01:45:18.687 --> 01:45:19.888]  They said they didn't exist.
[01:45:20.643 --> 01:45:31.970]  They have a bunch of former Nazis in it, and their daughters, like Queen Beatrix, the daughter of Prince Bernhard, they've been involved in all these bid-rigging scams and Lockheed payoff scandals, I mean, on record.
[01:45:32.770 --> 01:45:37.353]  And the British media reports that having Cameron in it last year was illegal.
[01:45:37.673 --> 01:45:39.094]  I mean, it's important to cover this.
[01:45:41.215 --> 01:45:46.418]  Well, the last time I checked, there were no mainstream reports, and we're talking about
[01:45:47.732 --> 01:45:52.196]  Two days out from the meeting of 120 of the world's global power brokers.
[01:45:52.217 --> 01:45:59.885]  You know, compare that to Davos, compare that to the G8, which is a continuation of the consensus which is set at Bilderberg.
[01:46:00.445 --> 01:46:02.928]  And there are no mainstream media reports whatsoever.
[01:46:03.883 --> 01:46:08.628]  Even though we have representatives of the mainstream media attending Bilderberg, so what does that tell you?
[01:46:08.648 --> 01:46:17.377]  I mean, we're here, the ragtag band of independent journalists and bloggers trying desperately to cover this in the face of official oppression.
[01:46:18.234 --> 01:46:20.755]  Wow, it's been completely ignored by the mainstream.
[01:46:20.855 --> 01:46:22.876]  I was watching CNN earlier in the hotel.
[01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:26.037]  They were still talking about the missing Malaysian plane.
[01:46:26.377 --> 01:46:29.618]  They were talking about supermodel girls on Instagram for the first time.
[01:46:30.138 --> 01:46:31.238]  Completely mindless.
[01:46:31.298 --> 01:46:34.219]  Coming up, the Oscars and how to buy a sailboat.
[01:46:34.339 --> 01:46:34.599]  Yes.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:40.801]  And they wonder why, for example, CNN lost, you know, 48% of its audience in the past 12 months.
[01:46:40.821 --> 01:46:41.722]  They wonder why.
[01:46:42.122 --> 01:46:46.143]  How can they wonder any longer when we're right here at the center of the storm?
[01:46:47.069 --> 01:46:50.134]  And there are no mainstream media reports whatsoever.
[01:46:50.475 --> 01:46:58.628]  Obviously there'll be a few tough pieces later in the week as is routine, but as of now, extremely limited in terms of coverage.
[01:46:59.366 --> 01:47:02.068]  Well, this happens every year now, the last five or six.
[01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:11.016]  Drugs links to the list, starts linking to our articles, starts linking to our reports, and then it forces the media to cover it.
[01:47:11.156 --> 01:47:15.860]  As soon as the Guardian reports on it, obviously then they'll also be forced to do that as well.
[01:47:16.461 --> 01:47:18.082]  But I really appreciate you, Watson.
[01:47:18.122 --> 01:47:18.703]  Stay safe.
[01:47:19.203 --> 01:47:20.284]  Shoot a lot of videos.
[01:47:20.764 --> 01:47:21.745]  Upload them to YouTube.
[01:47:21.845 --> 01:47:22.906]  A lot of live streams.
[01:47:23.387 --> 01:47:25.709]  And we'll have you via video Skype tomorrow.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:33.385]  30 minutes in and maybe you can walk around the hotel with your laptop, with the live feed, or via the iPhone.
[01:47:33.885 --> 01:47:36.587]  But the reporters should be there with you tomorrow as well.
[01:47:36.627 --> 01:47:40.069]  They get in early in the morning our time, tomorrow your time.
[01:47:40.449 --> 01:47:44.492]  So great job Paul Joseph Watson reporting from Bilderberg 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[01:47:49.173 --> 01:47:52.376]  And Paul will obviously be filing a lot of reports as well.
[01:47:52.716 --> 01:48:02.264]  We've got our great team of Kurt Nemo, Kit Daniels, Adon Salazar and others here working on the InfoWars end in Austin, Texas to collate all that data.
[01:48:02.605 --> 01:48:04.286]  We have the news, TV news end.
[01:48:05.127 --> 01:48:12.573]  It'll be grabbing all the videos, live feeds and other things and collating that into reports for the nightly news, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:48:12.893 --> 01:48:14.415]  And let me just stop there for a moment
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:21.406]  This is real news, where we wear our bias for freedom, our bias for truth, on our sleeve openly.
[01:48:22.547 --> 01:48:28.753]  Where we don't make apologies for the fact that we're free market, pro-family, pro-man, pro-woman, pro-child, pro-human.
[01:48:29.434 --> 01:48:32.136]  We're anti-eugenicist, we're anti-criminal, we're pro-liberty.
[01:48:32.957 --> 01:48:38.022]  And we are funded not by government stimulus money like NBC and MSNBC,
[01:48:39.059 --> 01:48:46.280]  We are not funded like NPR, as I've said a thousand times, with $400 million or $500 million, depending on the year of taxpayer money, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:53.502]  We are funded by you buying the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the high-quality supplements at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:48:55.142 --> 01:48:59.363]  We try to bring you the very best products, the lowest prices, so it's a win-win-win all around.
[01:49:00.123 --> 01:49:05.664]  Out of print titles like None Dare Call a Conspiracy, right up to the latest Police State book, put out by WorldNetDaily.
[01:49:06.912 --> 01:49:12.674]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:49:12.874 --> 01:49:21.437]  And please don't forget, the cutting edge of real new media that's supplanting the dinosaur is PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:21.677 --> 01:49:24.198]  $5.95 a month, 11 memberships for each membership.
[01:49:25.339 --> 01:49:28.000]  11 people can simultaneously log in with the same username.
[01:49:29.028 --> 01:49:29.709]  to the site.
[01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:31.450]  So make sure it's an original one.
[01:49:31.630 --> 01:49:33.032]  It was just for the site.
[01:49:33.052 --> 01:49:34.253]  Don't have it for all your other stuff.
[01:49:34.293 --> 01:49:35.594]  Create a new username if you need to.
[01:49:36.094 --> 01:49:39.417]  And then share that with friends and family so they can watch.
[01:49:39.517 --> 01:49:42.860]  Download the HD Nightly News after it streams.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:43.961]  It goes up in HD.
[01:49:44.421 --> 01:49:45.462]  Give it to friends and family.
[01:49:45.642 --> 01:49:46.123]  Archive it.
[01:49:48.035 --> 01:49:49.256]  Clip it together the way you want.
[01:49:49.276 --> 01:49:50.317]  Put it on Local Access TV.
[01:49:50.397 --> 01:49:51.277]  This is your media.
[01:49:51.317 --> 01:49:58.083]  You have full authorization to use it any way you want, as long as it's for fair use, non-profit purposes.
[01:49:58.143 --> 01:49:59.764]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:00.124 --> 01:50:01.125]  Become a member today.
[01:50:01.165 --> 01:50:02.566]  If you used to be a member, let it lapse.
[01:50:02.966 --> 01:50:03.847]  Become a member again.
[01:50:04.547 --> 01:50:06.489]  But I don't want you to just become a member even if you don't use it.
[01:50:08.148 --> 01:50:13.572]  It is to support us, because we pretty much have it at cost to fund the reporters and the TV and the operation.
[01:50:14.252 --> 01:50:16.134]  The goal is to get more people watching it.
[01:50:16.554 --> 01:50:19.196]  So share that membership or buy a membership.
[01:50:19.956 --> 01:50:22.198]  Create an original username and passcode, give it to friends and family.
[01:50:22.878 --> 01:50:24.860]  Buy somebody a one-time monthly and give it to them.
[01:50:26.841 --> 01:50:33.826]  This is how we reach out to more people and this is how you help fund the literal tip of the spear in the new dominant media.
[01:50:35.057 --> 01:50:39.598]  Again, we have close to 20 million, I keep saying 15 million, listeners and viewers one way or another every week.
[01:50:42.759 --> 01:50:48.560]  I mean, we're just not arrogant on a power trip like CNN, who almost has no viewers.
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:53.361]  The only shoe to drop, the only domino to fall, is that the mainstream media is dead.
[01:50:53.881 --> 01:50:55.741]  I mean, Ed Schultz just quit his radio show.
[01:50:56.701 --> 01:50:57.642]  Because no one's listening.
[01:50:57.702 --> 01:50:58.362]  It isn't real.
[01:50:58.462 --> 01:50:59.322]  It's all a facade.
[01:50:59.542 --> 01:50:59.982]  It's a fraud.
[01:51:01.656 --> 01:51:06.599]  Our founders pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to fight tyranny, and it's time to fight again.
[01:51:06.679 --> 01:51:10.180]  I'm Tisha Cassada, and I'm running as an independent for Congress in Colorado.
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:15.003]  I fight to end the military police state, ban GMO toxic foods, and abolish legal tender laws.
[01:51:15.103 --> 01:51:18.485]  Consider donating some of your hard-earned fiat currency to help me fight.
[01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:21.726]  Donate $25 or more, and you'll receive a gift to awaken others.
[01:51:21.826 --> 01:51:23.527]  I need and appreciate your support.
[01:51:23.587 --> 01:51:25.988]  Please donate at Cassada2014.com.
[01:51:26.068 --> 01:51:28.910]  That's C-A-S-I-D-A-2014.com.
[01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:31.111]  Paid for by the committee to elect Tisha Cassada to Congress.
[01:51:31.411 --> 01:51:32.452]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:51:32.532 --> 01:51:36.854]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:37.034 --> 01:51:42.638]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:51:42.738 --> 01:51:46.100]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:53:37.136 --> 01:53:38.376]  Silverlungs.com.

[01:54:13.413 --> 01:54:17.957]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[01:54:19.438 --> 01:54:21.780]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:23.481]  Don't send your kinfolks around.
[01:54:24.322 --> 01:54:28.105]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking.
[01:54:28.606 --> 01:54:29.186]  I'll be gone.
[01:54:30.367 --> 01:54:32.089]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[01:54:34.727 --> 01:54:39.671]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[01:54:39.691 --> 01:54:43.975]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[01:54:44.375 --> 01:54:49.079]  Don't give me that old familiar cry and cuss and moan.
[01:54:49.359 --> 01:54:55.024]  Understand your man, Michelle Obama.
[01:54:55.104 --> 01:54:55.765]  Shut up, witch.
[01:54:55.985 --> 01:54:57.606]  You don't run my life.
[01:54:57.666 --> 01:55:02.470]  Either the Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton, all you sickening criminals.
[01:55:12.483 --> 01:55:16.164]  When they try to blame us for mass shootings, we had nothing to do with it, we should get angry and back in their face.
[01:55:16.364 --> 01:55:21.965]  How dare you collectively blame me and your victim disarmament zones when another one of your mental patients went out and killed some people?
[01:55:24.026 --> 01:55:33.848]  How dare you try to tell us in Denver and Chicago and now other cities under the school lunch program that parents can't be trusted to pack their children's lunches and have to eat the prison food?
[01:55:35.269 --> 01:55:39.610]  See, how dare them in England try to outlaw the word girl?
[01:55:40.777 --> 01:55:42.679]  Saying that it hurts women's feelings.
[01:55:43.799 --> 01:55:45.701]  How are you saying the word girl is derogatory?
[01:55:48.143 --> 01:55:52.086]  It's meant to be, oh, okay, I'll do what you say so you don't call me racist.
[01:55:52.486 --> 01:55:58.951]  They've taken old evils of racism, tribalism, that every group does, and turned it into everything now to keep it going.
[01:55:59.672 --> 01:56:01.033]  We have to reject it.
[01:56:02.294 --> 01:56:03.435]  And stop being politically correct.
[01:56:06.468 --> 01:56:13.214]  BBC mauled for ruling girl as offensive and removing it from broadcast.
[01:56:14.455 --> 01:56:14.916]  Daily Mail.
[01:56:15.296 --> 01:56:26.807]  But speaking of Michelle Obama, the snapping turtle, the anti-gun, anti-family, New World Order frontwoman, she's the face of the federalization of school food.
[01:56:28.186 --> 01:56:31.027]  To make sure that companies get the highest profit for the crappiest food.
[01:56:31.968 --> 01:56:33.288]  First Lady Michelle Obama.
[01:56:33.348 --> 01:56:35.249]  What are the Feds doing involved in school lunches?
[01:56:35.549 --> 01:56:37.310]  What are the Feds involved telling you what you're going to eat?
[01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:41.632]  See, that's how it begins with federal assistance, then now they write the book.
[01:56:42.573 --> 01:56:48.115]  Same federal government that injected black people with syphilis and sprayed US troops with nerve gas to kill them and the atomic soldiers.
[01:56:48.476 --> 01:56:52.938]  The same one that radiated over 4,000 children to death in secret trials declassified in the 80s.
[01:56:53.578 --> 01:56:55.159]  They now want to decide what you're going to eat.
[01:56:56.266 --> 01:57:00.388]  And the Pentagon in San Antonio and other cities has multi-million dollar A.I.
[01:57:00.908 --> 01:57:06.890]  cameras that watch your children as they eat for signs that they're eating properly and aren't mentally ill.
[01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:08.411]  That sounds like a free society.
[01:57:08.691 --> 01:57:09.871]  Pentagon A.I.
[01:57:09.911 --> 01:57:13.192]  computers that calculate the calories your children eat.
[01:57:13.652 --> 01:57:15.513]  They brag why they eat half the apple.
[01:57:15.833 --> 01:57:18.494]  We know their calorie intake from the apple.
[01:57:18.694 --> 01:57:19.375]  You think I'm joking?
[01:57:19.395 --> 01:57:19.855]  Just type in
[01:57:20.675 --> 01:57:23.319]  Cameras to monitor children's eating habits in San Antonio.
[01:57:23.339 --> 01:57:27.446]  Then you read, oh, the Department of Defense is here in uniforms to watch our kids.
[01:57:29.168 --> 01:57:30.370]  It's a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:57:31.932 --> 01:57:34.997]  First, snapping turtle Michelle Obama.
[01:57:35.956 --> 01:57:40.439]  is answering Republicans in Congress who want to roll back healthier school meal standards.
[01:57:40.719 --> 01:57:43.141]  See, it's AP says it's healthier meal.
[01:57:43.181 --> 01:57:45.582]  It's not that it's her running our life as the frontwoman.
[01:57:45.602 --> 01:57:46.703]  It's not that it's terrible food.
[01:57:46.743 --> 01:57:48.664]  It's not that GMO isn't healthier.
[01:57:48.704 --> 01:57:51.546]  It's not that, you know, they're saying any fat is bad when you need fat.
[01:57:51.566 --> 01:57:54.608]  It's not that the diet's for a zombie or it would kill a prisoner.
[01:57:54.628 --> 01:57:55.209]  No, no.
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:58:07.246]  First Lady Michelle Obama is answering Republicans in Congress who want to roll back healthier school meal standards, holding an event at the White House to highlight the success of the health guidelines.
[01:58:07.786 --> 01:58:09.147]  Oh, it's successful!
[01:58:09.167 --> 01:58:12.749]  And now they're telling you they're going to decide what your kid eats at home.
[01:58:13.769 --> 01:58:14.290]  I've looked it up.
[01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:24.918]  People ate larger diets, more fattening food, you know, dessert twice a day, chicken fried steaks, and weren't as obese or unhealthy 50 years ago as they are now.
[01:58:25.238 --> 01:58:27.720]  It's the GMO and the additives and what's in the environment.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:29.841]  And they want to ask why everybody's getting so sick.
[01:58:30.802 --> 01:58:32.824]  People had more sugar 50 years ago than they do now.
[01:58:33.004 --> 01:58:33.504]  Did you know that?
[01:58:34.045 --> 01:58:35.846]  They're killing us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:36.907 --> 01:58:39.469]  But don't worry, Michelle, she knows best.
[01:58:42.284 --> 01:58:44.466]  Totally normal to have the First Lady tell us what to eat.
[01:58:44.486 --> 01:58:46.988]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:47.008 --> 01:58:48.369]  Think how these kids are being brought up.
[01:58:48.389 --> 01:58:49.170]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:50.131]  Then the last one coming up.
[01:58:51.492 --> 01:58:58.557]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:58:58.658 --> 01:59:00.839]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:06.104]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:59:06.304 --> 01:59:11.228]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:59:11.448 --> 01:59:14.511]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:59:14.771 --> 01:59:18.615]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:59:18.635 --> 01:59:23.079]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:33.189]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:59:33.409 --> 01:59:35.932]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:59:36.052 --> 01:59:36.953]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:36.973 --> 01:59:38.614]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.417 --> 02:00:07.037]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.718 --> 02:00:08.738]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.478 --> 02:00:10.579]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.239 --> 02:00:12.039]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.819 --> 02:00:13.700]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:17.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.562 --> 02:00:22.623]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.972 --> 02:00:38.273]  I had meant to go to phone calls.
[02:00:39.474 --> 02:00:54.847]  I just never got the number out because it clicked to me that I was going to have reporters on today from Bilderberg, but David Knight and Josh Owens couldn't fly out of Texas because of literally thunderstorms.
[02:00:55.687 --> 02:00:59.771]  I sat there and watched thunderstorms out the window all Saturday and Sunday, all day off and on.
[02:00:59.831 --> 02:01:00.972]  It was just spectacular.
[02:01:00.992 --> 02:01:02.553]  It was like something out of a movie.
[02:01:02.593 --> 02:01:05.795]  Giant black clouds, electricity storms, flooding rivers.
[02:01:06.997 --> 02:01:13.219]  And half the state had giant thunderstorms over it, so all the air traffic was canceled in Houston and a lot of other major cities like San Antonio.
[02:01:13.719 --> 02:01:18.921]  So they couldn't get out flying out of, I guess, George Bush, George H.W.
[02:01:18.941 --> 02:01:21.842]  Bush, flying over to Copenhagen.
[02:01:22.742 --> 02:01:26.904]  But it clicked to me once I was on air, wait a minute, Paul Watson's there!
[02:01:27.864 --> 02:01:30.825]  We're supposed to get Paul Watson on today, that's been set for weeks.
[02:01:32.306 --> 02:01:35.507]  And so we had Paul Watson on, that's why we send reporters.
[02:01:36.482 --> 02:01:40.363]  To foreign countries is to cover news events.
[02:01:40.663 --> 02:01:52.387]  And I just was, it was clicking for me that we get so busy, myself included, just looking at all the news as it comes out, we forget we're reporters actually out there covering events as they unfold.
[02:01:53.548 --> 02:01:59.410]  But Daniel Lesteland is going to be joining us and he always has really powerful intel.
[02:01:59.450 --> 02:02:00.690]  In fact, I should have queued it up.
[02:02:02.492 --> 02:02:03.233]  It's in Endgame.
[02:02:03.253 --> 02:02:05.074]  Maybe you guys can find Endgame on YouTube.
[02:02:05.094 --> 02:02:06.535]  It's got like 4 million views on the one.
[02:02:07.196 --> 02:02:14.001]  And skip ahead about an hour into it or so where you see Estalin in a bar talking.
[02:02:15.962 --> 02:02:22.167]  And that's where you'll find him saying they're going to implode the housing market in two years and blah blah blah from his sources.
[02:02:22.207 --> 02:02:23.748]  And then it happened exactly as he said.
[02:02:24.248 --> 02:02:25.489]  And they're worried about the militia.
[02:02:25.509 --> 02:02:28.531]  They're worried about the Ron Paul Liberty Movement that became the Tea Party.
[02:02:28.811 --> 02:02:30.673]  The term Tea Party wasn't even out then.
[02:02:31.994 --> 02:02:34.635]  Wasn't being associated with Ron Paul until right around that time.
[02:02:35.056 --> 02:02:35.896]  And that's what they're worried about.
[02:02:35.936 --> 02:02:41.579]  And now look in Europe, how the proto-neonationalism has returning.
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:48.963]  And people are recognizing, hey, our laws are being made by unelected globalist secret bureaus.
[02:02:49.923 --> 02:02:54.005]  And just the realization that that's happening, you see what's known as the Tea Party.
[02:02:55.406 --> 02:02:58.268]  UKIP is Tea Party aligned, Libertarian Tea Party.
[02:02:59.088 --> 02:03:00.489]  Same thing with the Le Pen movement.
[02:03:01.545 --> 02:03:04.306]  Same thing is happening in Canada, the US, Australia.
[02:03:05.726 --> 02:03:14.389]  We're trying to rediscover Western values and say no to globalist colonization, the corporate anti-free market monopoly takeover.
[02:03:16.710 --> 02:03:22.251]  That is busy scapegoating capitalism for all the drop in productivity, the drop in standard of living.
[02:03:23.192 --> 02:03:29.494]  This is a designed globalization to destroy the nation states and destroy the individual and make us all dependent.
[02:03:29.814 --> 02:03:30.534]  I mean, look at Libya.
[02:03:32.159 --> 02:03:39.145]  Where now, NATO is in there training a new army to invade the rest of Africa, in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, they put in charge.
[02:03:39.605 --> 02:03:41.407]  That's back in the news today.
[02:03:43.068 --> 02:03:48.113]  In my stack, is the new Libyan army being created by NATO.
[02:03:50.415 --> 02:03:54.418]  They overthrew the country, they put Al-Qaeda in charge, they're invading and destabilizing Africa.
[02:03:55.373 --> 02:03:59.376]  They want to destabilize Europe, they want to destabilize Africa, they don't want any prosperity.
[02:03:59.616 --> 02:04:07.701]  They want to wreck the third world, use the implosion of the third world as a tsunami of desperate people to take over the rest of the western world.
[02:04:08.681 --> 02:04:17.487]  While the globalists live in cloistered, armored, rural and city compounds exempt from what they do to us.
[02:04:20.498 --> 02:04:36.201]  It is a decision to work towards absolute inequity, absolute discrimination, absolute fraud, absolute hypocrisy, while having state-run media trumpet all day how much Hillary loves us.
[02:04:37.213 --> 02:04:38.994]  When she's in the top tenth of one percent.
[02:04:39.875 --> 02:04:46.920]  She's not a one percenter, she's a top tenth of one percenter, who got her money off of rigged cattle deals and other scams and carbon taxes.
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:53.204]  She is a giant, disgusting, worm-like, fascist, goblin parasite.
[02:04:54.145 --> 02:04:54.826]  Not a liberal.
[02:04:55.886 --> 02:04:57.147]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:57.187 --> 02:04:57.748]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.886 --> 02:05:07.928]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forklift situation?
[02:05:07.988 --> 02:05:11.290]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:13.050]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted.

[02:05:19.453 --> 02:05:25.355]  Is this another Forks Flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:05:25.495 --> 02:05:29.258]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:40.546]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:05:40.806 --> 02:05:42.848]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:05:42.908 --> 02:05:43.949]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:05:44.309 --> 02:05:53.061]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:06:02.594 --> 02:06:04.335]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[02:06:04.476 --> 02:06:08.419]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[02:06:08.599 --> 02:06:09.840]  It's like I don't even exist.
[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:11.982]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[02:06:12.142 --> 02:06:13.323]  Does this seem familiar?

[02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:05.353]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:07:05.373 --> 02:07:09.516]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:07:09.736 --> 02:07:13.159]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:07:13.399 --> 02:07:16.301]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:07:16.461 --> 02:07:23.827]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:07:24.027 --> 02:07:27.650]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:32.174]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:07:32.354 --> 02:07:38.279]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:07:38.319 --> 02:07:42.102]  Fluoride, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:07:42.262 --> 02:07:44.804]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:07:45.004 --> 02:07:46.345]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:07:46.505 --> 02:07:47.746]  It's time to take action.
[02:07:47.887 --> 02:07:49.588]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:08:29.071 --> 02:08:30.011]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:08:30.271 --> 02:08:31.312]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:08:31.612 --> 02:08:32.472]  Mao took the guns.
[02:08:32.652 --> 02:08:33.993]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[02:08:34.133 --> 02:08:38.094]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[02:08:38.514 --> 02:08:41.455]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[02:08:43.536 --> 02:08:46.537]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[02:08:48.658 --> 02:08:51.479]  I am sworn upon the altar of God.
[02:08:51.719 --> 02:08:55.480]  Eternal hostility against every form of tyranny.
[02:09:00.165 --> 02:09:01.669]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:09:02.070 --> 02:09:06.423]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:31.812 --> 02:09:32.633]  You want answers?
[02:09:33.113 --> 02:09:35.215]  You want to know what the tyrants are up to?
[02:09:35.235 --> 02:09:36.496]  Because knowing is half the battle.
[02:09:36.516 --> 02:09:38.257]  You want to fight tyranny?
[02:09:39.298 --> 02:09:40.019]  Well, so do we.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.824]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday edition.
[02:09:45.864 --> 02:09:46.965]  I'll keep almost saying Monday.
[02:09:47.765 --> 02:09:49.206]  This is Memorial Day being yesterday.
[02:09:50.648 --> 02:09:52.429]  DanielEsselin.com is his website.
[02:09:52.449 --> 02:09:56.532]  Daniel Esselin is with us for the balance of the hour via video Skype from Europe.
[02:09:57.837 --> 02:10:21.603]  And Daniel Esselin is a best-selling author in 64 countries, with a true story of the Bilderberg Group, translated into 41 languages, including number one bestseller in Spain, and he now has written the book that we shell, Trans Evolution, The Age of Human Deconstruction, and How the Paradigm Changed for Humanity that Shall Define Its Future and Threaten Its Very Existence.
[02:10:23.132 --> 02:10:28.073]  And he joins us to give us his latest intel from his sources.
[02:10:28.633 --> 02:10:36.555]  And again, it's in my film, Endgame, that came out in 2007, a full year and a half before the October 2008 crash.
[02:10:37.195 --> 02:10:48.457]  It has the clip of him in it, in the bar, where we all get together with reporters and share notes that his source, who I later learned who his source was separate from Daniel, one of his sources,
[02:10:52.037 --> 02:10:54.279]  In finance, I'll just leave it at that, but I'm just showing Daniel.
[02:10:54.339 --> 02:10:55.740]  I went and checked on his sources.
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:57.461]  We have some of our own sources as well.
[02:10:57.821 --> 02:10:58.662]  Tucker was a big one.
[02:10:58.702 --> 02:11:04.306]  He had some good sources, but those have dried up a little bit since his death last year, a few weeks before.
[02:11:04.767 --> 02:11:07.589]  Bilderberg's, you want to remember Jim Tucker, the original Bilderberg.
[02:11:09.045 --> 02:11:15.688]  He read Westbrook Pegler's articles in the 50s when Jim was a big sports writer and news writer nationwide.
[02:11:15.708 --> 02:11:18.889]  He was a big syndicated columnist, classic straw hat, whole nine yards.
[02:11:19.569 --> 02:11:22.310]  And he said, there's no way a secret political group's meeting, I would have heard about it.
[02:11:22.570 --> 02:11:23.430]  This would be big news.
[02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:27.452]  And then he began to sleuth it for decades when no one even knew the name of it.
[02:11:28.412 --> 02:11:35.135]  But then Estalin, because he's in the continent of Europe and went to a lot of these events where they got shot at in Portugal and other cases.
[02:11:36.519 --> 02:11:44.887]  was really able to get some amazing sources and so he joins us to give us the true intel agenda that he's been able to ferret out this year.
[02:11:45.528 --> 02:11:50.353]  The official list and what they claim their agenda is is now on their website, BilderbergMeetings.org.
[02:11:50.733 --> 02:11:51.694]  We have links to that
[02:11:52.595 --> 02:11:55.576]  Up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:55.956 --> 02:11:59.498]  DrudgeReport.com is linked to that right in the middle column of Drudge.
[02:11:59.798 --> 02:12:07.821]  But we have a boil-down page that has both their official press release of what they say their agenda is and the official list at InfoWars.com.
[02:12:08.401 --> 02:12:11.863]  But Daniel Esselin of DanielEsselin.com joins us.
[02:12:11.883 --> 02:12:14.144]  He's also the author of The Octopus Deception.
[02:12:14.904 --> 02:12:16.164]  Daniel, so much to cover.
[02:12:16.565 --> 02:12:17.465]  Where would you like to begin?
[02:12:20.535 --> 02:12:27.102]  Again, it's the Bill of Rights time of the year again, and I'm very happy to see that you're well and healthy and still going strong.
[02:12:27.162 --> 02:12:29.204]  So I need us to say thanks for the invitation.
[02:12:29.224 --> 02:12:38.813]  We can start, I guess, with the agenda items that have come to me through my sources, you said, about a week and a half ago.
[02:12:38.893 --> 02:12:39.774]  Now, I wouldn't be...
[02:12:41.348 --> 02:12:54.811]  Particularly trustee of what the Bilderbergers say their agenda items are because a lot of the times the actual agenda list of discussion points and what has been published on our webpage is or is something watered down.
[02:12:55.942 --> 02:13:00.426]  Or complete fallacy, especially if you're dealing with some thorny issues as we are this year.
[02:13:00.946 --> 02:13:05.831]  So I can give you the seven out of about nine or ten items that I'll be discussing.
[02:13:05.891 --> 02:13:08.233]  Number one, nuclear diplomacy.
[02:13:08.273 --> 02:13:11.956]  The coming struggle over Iran nuclear pact.
[02:13:12.396 --> 02:13:13.317]  This is one of the items.
[02:13:13.397 --> 02:13:19.843]  It's very interesting to say because Obama's or the elites or the oligarchies or Bilderbergers' nightmares
[02:13:21.584 --> 02:13:28.406]  With Russia, China and Iran working together against the will-be powers of the world.
[02:13:28.886 --> 02:13:36.909]  The second item I have from my sources is the consequences of Russia-China gas agreement on long-term cooperation.
[02:13:37.369 --> 02:13:40.610]  Needless to say, Bilderberg is going to be very, very, very angry at Obama.
[02:13:40.630 --> 02:13:44.871]  They're going to basically call him out and ask him what exactly he's planning to do.
[02:13:47.012 --> 02:13:58.096]  They've got the front door locked, allegedly, with their... I can't think of the word.
[02:14:02.492 --> 02:14:03.353]  NATO system?
[02:14:04.993 --> 02:14:07.775]  Exactly, with a boycott of the Russian economy.
[02:14:07.795 --> 02:14:08.736]  I just can't think of a word right now.
[02:14:09.156 --> 02:14:10.817]  But what they forgot to do is... Sanctions?
[02:14:11.357 --> 02:14:11.877]  Sanctions.
[02:14:11.937 --> 02:14:12.878]  That's right, that's right.
[02:14:13.258 --> 02:14:15.700]  What they forgot to do is actually get the backdoor locked.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:21.723]  So the Russians and the Chinese gas agreement is, needless to say, something that especially the Europeans are very worried about.
[02:14:22.143 --> 02:14:28.187]  Number three is the German nationalism through a prism of European Union's political system.
[02:14:28.647 --> 02:14:39.693]  That's a very, very interesting point because, again, we're dealing with Europe's biggest nation economically and the fact that you're dealing with nationalism itself.
[02:14:39.793 --> 02:14:54.202]  And again, keep in mind that this list that I'm reading off right now came to me about a week before the elections, European elections on Sunday, which showed how extreme left and right and basically nationalist parties across the continent
[02:14:54.682 --> 02:15:03.295]  I've taken a very big chunk out of the traditional left-right divide, Hegelian dialectic, as we say in the European Parliament.
[02:15:03.315 --> 02:15:10.186]  Then the fourth item is European Union's internet privacy regulations and what it means for the United States.
[02:15:10.766 --> 02:15:12.428]  Fifth is cyber war and peace.
[02:15:12.548 --> 02:15:15.231]  And again, we're seeing a lot of that, especially with the United States and China.
[02:15:15.732 --> 02:15:17.774]  Sixth point is from Ukraine to Syria.
[02:15:18.215 --> 02:15:20.598]  Is Obama's foreign policy doomed?
[02:15:20.698 --> 02:15:25.403]  Again, Obama is going to be in the eye of the storm in this particular meeting.
[02:15:25.443 --> 02:15:29.728]  Needless to say, American presidents, sitting presidents never attend building meetings, although
[02:15:30.829 --> 02:15:31.309]  Do you
[02:15:50.354 --> 02:15:54.936]  Uh, theoretically, if you were to be elected president, Mr. Clinton, would you support NAFTA?
[02:15:55.616 --> 02:16:02.539]  And, uh, Clinton, who had no idea what NAFTA was, asked Rockefeller, it was important to him, and Rockefeller said, very important, and he said, of course I would, David.
[02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:05.781]  And so Rockefeller extended his hand and he said, thank you, Mr. President.
[02:16:06.481 --> 02:16:07.242]  The rest is history.
[02:16:07.302 --> 02:16:13.506]  Alex, as you know, this is a story that I go in somewhat more detail in my book, The True Story of the Bilbo Group.
[02:16:14.026 --> 02:16:21.431]  Then the seventh item of nine or ten that I have is climate change, ethical and economic challenges ahead.
[02:16:21.471 --> 02:16:24.373]  Again, we're back to the same dead horse, climate change.
[02:16:24.733 --> 02:16:31.598]  And again, it's just a metaphor for reducing the world's economy, for deindustrialization, zero growth.
[02:16:32.759 --> 02:16:35.340]  And we're seeing the effects of that on the world stage today.
[02:16:36.321 --> 02:16:38.504]  So, neo-feudalism, amazing.
[02:16:38.544 --> 02:16:39.866]  So, going over these points again.
[02:16:39.886 --> 02:16:44.191]  And I want listeners to understand, Estillon really does have Bilderberg sources.
[02:16:44.772 --> 02:16:45.834]  We've confirmed that.
[02:16:45.974 --> 02:16:51.921]  So, this is so important what you're hearing, that weeks ago, he's now revealing that here to us exclusively.
[02:16:51.961 --> 02:16:52.642]  We're very thankful.
[02:16:53.593 --> 02:16:58.418]  That obviously, who they say is on the list, there's about 20-30 people that sneak in.
[02:16:58.838 --> 02:17:02.362]  Presidents, Prime Ministers, we're going to have our reporters there documenting that.
[02:17:03.143 --> 02:17:13.113]  What they claim their agenda is, will be a few little speeches they give to get around the fact that this is illegal in most countries to be setting policy in secret, especially in England, but also in Denmark.
[02:17:13.733 --> 02:17:15.695]  And then they have the real meetings that break away.
[02:17:15.715 --> 02:17:20.740]  And this has come out in their minutes that have come out of the National Archives from the 67 and others.
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:23.083]  So we've been able to reverse engineer a lot of this.
[02:17:23.543 --> 02:17:34.555]  But Estalin has multiple sources, one of which we're aware of, that is able to get the internal minutes, I guess from their steering committees, that they have meetings three times a year at least in Europe, England, and the U.S.
[02:17:35.015 --> 02:17:37.237]  One meeting in the U.S., one meeting in England, one meeting in Europe.
[02:17:37.257 --> 02:17:37.698]  It varies.
[02:17:38.378 --> 02:17:53.944]  Sometimes, where you have the top people pretty much hammering out what the agenda is, then it's sent to the second tier, correct me if I'm wrong, Daniel, to have any changes, parliamentary, from what then goes on at the informal, pretty much voting that goes on, but big.
[02:17:54.664 --> 02:18:05.208]  Nuke proliferation, China, Russia, how to use sanctions, how to block them, how to cut Russia's funding off, because they cut them off in Europe, making their money, they'll just do it with China, how does that happen?
[02:18:07.069 --> 02:18:23.944]  German nationalism, the Le Pen movement, UKIP spreading, the Real Tea Party movement here that the establishment is threatened by, web takeover, and laws that Europe may pass restricting illegal NSA surveillance.
[02:18:23.964 --> 02:18:24.865]  What will that do here?
[02:18:25.906 --> 02:18:26.546]  Cyber war.
[02:18:27.287 --> 02:18:32.290]  I guess that's how they plan to attack, claim somebody else did it, and use that as the excuse for the takeover of the web.
[02:18:32.611 --> 02:18:34.192]  Is their cover term cyber war?
[02:18:34.792 --> 02:18:35.893]  Obama being doomed?
[02:18:36.353 --> 02:18:38.835]  How do they flush Obama because he can't get the agenda through?
[02:18:39.735 --> 02:18:41.376]  He was Bilderberg darling, as we know.
[02:18:42.077 --> 02:18:44.198]  Climate change or global taxes, neo-feudalism.
[02:18:44.478 --> 02:18:46.500]  Is that an accurate roundup of what you just said, sir?
[02:18:47.159 --> 02:18:48.319]  Yes, sir, very much so.
[02:18:48.359 --> 02:19:01.644]  Now, as you were going through the list, I was kind of thinking to myself, what would people who are listening or who are not familiar with Bilderberg, and who might be listening for the first or second time, actually the existence of this group.
[02:19:01.964 --> 02:19:06.606]  Now, to most people who are not familiar with Bilderberg, this whole thing sounds crazy, because again,
[02:19:07.046 --> 02:19:15.350]  How do you convince people that a meeting that takes place once a year, during three days or three and a half days, actually has such tremendous effect on world policy?
[02:19:15.370 --> 02:19:22.773]  And this is something, if we have a minute, I'd like to explain so that people understand that this isn't some kind of a wacky conspiracy theory, but this thing is real.
[02:19:23.753 --> 02:19:25.114]  And there's a way that this thing works.
[02:19:26.534 --> 02:19:27.855]  Daniel, absolutely, we're going to come back.
[02:19:27.895 --> 02:19:30.136]  I will give you the floor in the next six-minute segment.
[02:19:30.476 --> 02:19:34.058]  Then an 18-minute segment's coming up in another six minutes to really break this down.
[02:19:35.455 --> 02:19:36.195]  We're not bragging.
[02:19:36.415 --> 02:19:37.796]  This is major gravitas here.
[02:19:38.576 --> 02:19:43.038]  You're hearing what the most powerful group in the world... They don't run the world.
[02:19:43.058 --> 02:19:43.718]  They're trying to.
[02:19:44.059 --> 02:19:45.859]  They run probably half the world or more.
[02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:49.141]  You're hearing what's on their real agenda right now.
[02:19:49.961 --> 02:19:52.302]  There are major spy agencies that don't know this stuff.
[02:19:52.622 --> 02:19:53.863]  They're tuned in right now as well.
[02:19:54.543 --> 02:19:59.465]  This is hardcore info that you're getting from the highest levels.

[02:20:30.791 --> 02:20:40.059]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:40.099 --> 02:20:40.839]  This capitalism?
[02:20:40.899 --> 02:20:47.024]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:47.064 --> 02:20:50.707]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:21:09.807 --> 02:21:11.528]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[02:21:11.909 --> 02:21:13.169]  Police call it robbery.
[02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:15.491]  We call it avoidable.
[02:21:15.991 --> 02:21:21.615]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.

[02:22:59.646 --> 02:23:02.607]  This is Keisha Rogers, Democratic candidate for the U.S.
[02:23:02.647 --> 02:23:02.947]  Senate.
[02:23:03.167 --> 02:23:16.073]  Today is your chance to change the course of history by voting for me to kick the corrupt Obama regime out of the Democratic Party and pick up where our nation left off under a truly great president, John F. Kennedy.
[02:23:16.633 --> 02:23:24.020]  I'm running to break the control of Wall Street parasites over our government and over both parties by reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act.
[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:25.942]  That means no more bailouts.
[02:23:26.542 --> 02:23:37.532]  The corrupt Democratic Party leadership doesn't want you to vote at all, as they're trying to sneak in a Wall Street millionaire who will easily lose to Wall Street Republicans like John Cornyn.
[02:23:37.893 --> 02:23:42.257]  This is your chance to break Texas free from that lose-lose situation.
[02:23:42.797 --> 02:23:50.741]  I have a program to revive the pro-growth, scientific tradition of John F. Kennedy, exemplified by the space program and nuclear power.

[02:23:54.723 --> 02:23:55.023]  Senate.

[02:23:57.504 --> 02:23:58.885]  Paid for by Kesha Rogers for U.S.
[02:23:58.905 --> 02:23:59.125]  Senate.
[02:24:06.769 --> 02:24:10.411]  Welcome back, my friends, to our continued coverage of Bilderberg 2014.
[02:24:12.492 --> 02:24:15.093]  The mainstream media they own and control is dying.
[02:24:15.654 --> 02:24:18.695]  They won't cover it, so we do at Infowars.com.
[02:24:19.636 --> 02:24:20.836]  We've got Paul Watson on the ground.
[02:24:20.876 --> 02:24:22.197]  Our other reporters get there tomorrow.
[02:24:22.217 --> 02:24:23.017]  Their flights were delayed.
[02:24:23.577 --> 02:24:26.399]  You've got the floor to break down how big a deal Bilderberg is.
[02:24:26.919 --> 02:24:34.883]  You know, just last week, one of the Bilderberg group members, we covered it last hour with Paul Watson, Daniel, bragged that they indeed are the most powerful and are setting up a world government.
[02:24:34.943 --> 02:24:37.865]  So, we've really forced them to try to hide it in plain view.
[02:24:37.905 --> 02:24:38.525]  Daniel Estelin.
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:46.545]  You know, no matter, Alex, where you look, governments, big business, and any other institutions seeking to exercise power, the key to control is secrecy.
[02:24:46.805 --> 02:25:06.318]  You know, meetings such as Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, G8, or we should say G7, Russia is no longer a member, World Trade Organization, World Economic Forum, Central Banks, European Union Council of Ministers, European Commissioners, European Union Summits, government cabinet meetings, numerous think tanks, foundations,
[02:25:06.878 --> 02:25:15.864]  You know, they're always conducted behind closed doors, and the only possible reason for this is that they, you know, the powerful people, don't want us to know what they're discussing.
[02:25:16.184 --> 02:25:24.750]  Now, and of course, beyond this common reluctance to actually reveal the proceedings of meetings, the secrecy principle extends to the forums and meetings themselves.
[02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:27.792]  By and large, we don't even know most of these meetings take place.
[02:25:28.092 --> 02:25:29.713]  You know, you mentioned Jim Tucker earlier.
[02:25:29.933 --> 02:25:33.356]  Well, he's been doing it, you know, God bless his soul, since the 1970s, I believe.
[02:25:33.456 --> 02:25:34.236]  And before that, it was
[02:25:36.818 --> 02:25:38.520]  I think so.
[02:25:55.678 --> 02:25:56.598]  That's something to do with it.
[02:25:56.998 --> 02:25:59.299]  I laughed in his face because I thought this is impossible.
[02:25:59.619 --> 02:26:06.921]  Well, needless to say, it is possible because, again, by and large, we, the people, don't even know most of these meetings actually take place.
[02:26:07.361 --> 02:26:11.082]  You have the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, late January, early February.
[02:26:11.102 --> 02:26:14.063]  You have the Bilderberg and G7 meetings April, May.
[02:26:14.483 --> 02:26:18.004]  You have the International Monetary Fund World Bank annual conference in September.
[02:26:18.484 --> 02:26:18.684]  I don't
[02:26:38.774 --> 02:26:39.895]  Quarterly seminars.
[02:26:40.515 --> 02:26:43.798]  You know, it's a kind of a visible international consensus emerges.
[02:26:44.178 --> 02:26:46.439]  And it carried over from one meeting to the next.
[02:26:46.779 --> 02:26:48.380]  But no one is really leading.
[02:26:48.420 --> 02:26:50.001]  And that's something that people have to understand.
[02:26:50.442 --> 02:26:53.704]  You know, Bilderberg is not some kind of a wacky conspiracy.
[02:26:53.744 --> 02:27:03.210]  We have these, you know, four old geezers sitting in a dark room, you know, underground, holding hands, staring at a crystal ball, planning the world's domination, pressing buttons and making the world go round.
[02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:05.451]  The world is a very complex place.
[02:27:05.952 --> 02:27:07.833]  No one is really leading this meeting.
[02:27:08.154 --> 02:27:10.415]  It works on the concept of consensus.
[02:27:10.816 --> 02:27:18.001]  And this consensus becomes the background, for example, for the G8 or G7 Economic Community Case.
[02:27:18.381 --> 02:27:25.867]  It becomes what informs the International Monetary Fund when it imposes an adjustment program on countries in the third world.
[02:27:26.187 --> 02:27:30.631]  And it also becomes what the United States President proposes to Congress, and needless to say,
[02:27:31.491 --> 02:27:31.951]  Very much.
[02:27:52.222 --> 02:27:57.306]  The people who attend Bilderberg Conferences are the movers and shakers of the world politics and economy you have.
[02:27:57.786 --> 02:28:01.369]  All the sitting presidents of European nations and Canada usually attend.
[02:28:01.409 --> 02:28:06.653]  As I said, sitting president of the United States never comes to these meetings, but he's well represented by his minions.
[02:28:07.033 --> 02:28:12.798]  You have, you know, key 50, 60 CEOs of the world's most powerful corporations from the Western world.
[02:28:13.438 --> 02:28:14.399]  You know, we're talking about
[02:28:15.039 --> 02:28:23.404]  Amazon, we're talking about corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, GlaxoSmithKline, Beecham.
[02:28:23.484 --> 02:28:25.526]  Every walk of life is IBM, needless to say.
[02:28:25.826 --> 02:28:27.527]  Top corporate leaders are there.
[02:28:27.847 --> 02:28:30.949]  You're talking about key members of the world press
[02:28:31.209 --> 02:28:50.606]  New York Times, Washington Post, The Economist, CNN, they're all there, Le Monde from France, a group of police are from Spain, you have Financial Times is there, all of these individuals they attend on the condition that what is said is not reported in the mainstream press because they're part of this juggernaut.
[02:28:51.346 --> 02:29:01.654]  You know, the key politicians, you have key ministers, key commissioners, you have the president of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, Federal Reserve Board, you have the chairman of the European Central Bank.
[02:29:01.894 --> 02:29:12.823]  So amongst these people, again, no one tells anybody what to do, but the consensus reached at these meetings go a long way in defining and deciding world policy.
[02:29:13.902 --> 02:29:14.302]  That's right.
[02:29:14.322 --> 02:29:20.967]  When we come back in the long segment, I'm going to break down some of the history of it and then what's going forward, how they try to plan to block.
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:23.021]  Nationalist movements.
[02:29:23.041 --> 02:29:25.422]  I don't know what they see as the main threat with Daniel Esselstyn.
[02:29:25.742 --> 02:29:28.984]  And I'm going to add and augment what you've just said that I totally agree with.
[02:29:29.524 --> 02:29:40.390]  That it's a consensus synergy where you're invited because you already agree on the global governance worldview to be run by autocrats and corporations.
[02:29:41.511 --> 02:29:43.932]  So we're going to talk about that on the other side.
[02:29:44.512 --> 02:29:49.455]  There's a consensus because all they're doing is fine-tuning a program launched a hundred years ago.
[02:29:50.845 --> 02:29:53.849]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:57.473]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.502 --> 02:30:04.424]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:04.564 --> 02:30:06.505]  The latest in preparedness is now here.

[02:30:12.890 --> 02:30:17.913]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[02:30:17.993 --> 02:30:22.737]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.

[02:30:36.266 --> 02:30:38.207]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[02:30:38.427 --> 02:30:49.514]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:04.041]  This is Scottish John for Infowars.com.
[02:31:04.141 --> 02:31:10.663]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at Infowars.
[02:31:10.823 --> 02:31:13.424]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[02:31:13.604 --> 02:31:15.365]  If not, then I want to know why.
[02:31:15.565 --> 02:31:17.766]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[02:31:17.866 --> 02:31:22.067]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[02:31:22.327 --> 02:31:23.347]  I say, so what?
[02:31:23.507 --> 02:31:25.488]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[02:31:25.708 --> 02:31:28.808]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[02:31:29.068 --> 02:31:33.189]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[02:31:33.329 --> 02:31:39.070]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm still fighting.
[02:31:39.170 --> 02:31:42.211]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[02:31:42.411 --> 02:31:44.091]  The Info War is worldwide.
[02:31:44.231 --> 02:31:48.352]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[02:31:48.552 --> 02:31:52.153]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented facts.
[02:31:52.253 --> 02:31:59.335]  Step up and take your friends and family to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and PlanetInfowars.com.
[02:31:59.495 --> 02:32:01.095]  The truth will set them free.
[02:32:01.395 --> 02:32:08.457]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:32:08.557 --> 02:32:10.717]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:32:10.918 --> 02:32:16.019]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:32:16.199 --> 02:32:21.120]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:24.421]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:32:24.681 --> 02:32:28.542]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:32:28.742 --> 02:32:32.983]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:32:33.063 --> 02:32:43.106]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:32:43.286 --> 02:32:45.827]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:32:46.007 --> 02:32:54.071]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:32:54.212 --> 02:32:58.174]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:11.408 --> 02:33:16.751]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:33:17.452 --> 02:33:21.934]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:33:22.455 --> 02:33:26.497]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[02:33:27.318 --> 02:33:28.598]  It's not about food.
[02:33:29.319 --> 02:33:31.900]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:33:38.556 --> 02:33:40.277]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:40.697 --> 02:33:43.678]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:45.418 --> 02:33:49.899]  Back in 2004, already 10 years ago, David Rockefeller wrote memoirs.
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:56.121]  And in it, he admits the whole plan for a private corporate planetary government.
[02:33:56.161 --> 02:33:59.442]  On page 244, we'll put the quote up on screen.
[02:34:00.342 --> 02:34:05.744]  He admits that there is a plan to create a world government.
[02:34:07.025 --> 02:34:11.667]  He also praised, when Mao Zedong died in the 70s, how wonderful Mao Zedong was in communism.
[02:34:12.207 --> 02:34:23.412]  Some even believe we're part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalists and conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global, political and economic structure.
[02:34:23.912 --> 02:34:24.732]  One world, if you will.
[02:34:25.332 --> 02:34:27.433]  If that's the charge, I stand guilty and I am proud of it.
[02:34:29.014 --> 02:34:32.015]  The issue is, they want to give us less for more.
[02:34:32.635 --> 02:34:33.456]  And they're exempt.
[02:34:34.366 --> 02:34:38.510]  The new order means you can't have a car air-conditioning and they're going to suppress new technology that's clean.
[02:34:39.371 --> 02:34:40.552]  That's what Obama told Africans.
[02:34:42.294 --> 02:34:49.802]  These are horrible people that have a very anti-human mission and who openly say across the board
[02:34:50.748 --> 02:34:55.811]  That it's the end of humanity as we know it, and it's a foregone conclusion that they're going to merge with machines, and that's just the way it is.
[02:34:56.391 --> 02:35:08.077]  In fact, we sell the book that's already a bestseller, Daniel Esselstyn's new book that breaks all of this down, Trans Evolution, The Age of Human Deconstruction, at infowarestore.com.
[02:35:08.117 --> 02:35:09.718]  You should get it and support him and support us.
[02:35:09.738 --> 02:35:14.560]  And he uses, you know, basically their own admissions in here to break down the plan.
[02:35:15.701 --> 02:35:17.982]  And this is foregone conclusion in their writings.
[02:35:19.244 --> 02:35:31.107]  I talk a lot about eco-science written in 74 by the White House Science Czar, John P. Holdren, along with Paul R. Ehrlich, they talk about that in there, but now they're doing it.
[02:35:31.207 --> 02:35:32.567]  I mean, it's their world.
[02:35:32.687 --> 02:35:39.149]  They have steered Western genius to build the Internet, but to make it all a control grid.
[02:35:39.849 --> 02:35:46.311]  They have woven together all the different corporate systems to build the ultimate team to bring this in, so that they and their progeny
[02:35:47.409 --> 02:35:51.570]  Gained the golden fields where mortals become immortal of Elysium.
[02:35:53.411 --> 02:36:01.113]  Now again, I'm not quoting from the new movie Elysium, I'm quoting from what Elysium is in Greek culture.
[02:36:02.494 --> 02:36:07.135]  And in Greek religion, ancient Greek religion, the globals follow Plato.
[02:36:07.775 --> 02:36:09.856]  They believe that they are ascending.
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:14.342]  And I want you to talk about their real agenda, Daniel, and if you agree with what I just said.
[02:36:14.382 --> 02:36:16.644]  And is there any way to stop these people at this time?
[02:36:16.664 --> 02:36:19.045]  Because their agenda is behind schedule in some ways.
[02:36:21.907 --> 02:36:25.169]  It's a very interesting point.
[02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:26.769]  I was listening to what you're saying, Alex.
[02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:35.755]  Before the break, you talked about, you know, the whole idea of countries, nations, states, as opposed to, you know, this pan-global dictatorship, which is basically what they're creating.
[02:36:37.116 --> 02:36:41.539]  And they call it One World Company Limited, corporations with a lot more power than any government on the planet.
[02:36:41.939 --> 02:37:03.016]  And this goes back to 1968, to the Bilderberg meeting in Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, Canada, where George Ball, Undersecretary for Economic Affairs, with JFK and Lyndon Johnson, talked about this as one of the key discussion points at that conference, almost 45 years ago, more than 45 years ago, and today, that we're seeing their plans
[02:37:03.516 --> 02:37:12.859]  For this Pan World Company Limited, where corporations have a lot more power than sitting presidents, sitting prime ministers, is becoming a reality.
[02:37:12.879 --> 02:37:18.260]  And it's a scary thing if you actually realize that they proposed this as an objective 45 years ago.
[02:37:18.300 --> 02:37:23.582]  Now, the whole point of a national system of nation states, as opposed to
[02:37:24.582 --> 02:37:29.805]  The pan world system obviously has to do with the way they understand how money works.
[02:37:30.205 --> 02:37:34.527]  Now, the world today is run by monetary systems, not by national credit systems.
[02:37:34.888 --> 02:37:37.889]  And if you're smart, you don't want a monetary system to run the world.
[02:37:37.949 --> 02:37:44.012]  You want a sovereign nation state to have their own credit system, which is the system of their currency.
[02:37:44.572 --> 02:37:53.397]  Above all, it's the possibility of productive, non-inflationary credit created by the state, which is firmly stated in the United States Constitution.
[02:37:53.837 --> 02:38:02.940]  And needless to say, it was excluded by the Maastricht Treaty as a method of determining of economic and financial policy.
[02:38:03.301 --> 02:38:11.804]  Now in Europe, this cannot be done because in Europe, governments are subject to control by private banking interests called independent banking systems.
[02:38:12.084 --> 02:38:17.506]  And these institutions have the power to regulate governments and to dictate terms to governments.
[02:38:18.046 --> 02:38:22.909]  And you think about this institution within the European edifice called the European Central Bank.
[02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:28.153]  It tries to function like the European Independent Central Bank, which has no government.
[02:38:28.193 --> 02:38:29.114]  There's no government.
[02:38:29.474 --> 02:38:30.395]  There's no nation.
[02:38:30.435 --> 02:38:33.357]  It's a group of nations run by a private bank.
[02:38:33.937 --> 02:38:43.191]  And it's insanity to belong to this group, which is something that a lot of people, millions of people, tens of millions of people across Europe are beginning to realize.
[02:38:43.211 --> 02:38:45.615]  It is insane to belong to the European Union.
[02:38:45.635 --> 02:38:49.381]  It is insane to belong to anything other than nation-states.
[02:38:49.881 --> 02:39:07.033]  This supposed independence of the central bank is the decisive control mechanism for private financial interests, which historically in Europe have been installed as an authoritative instrument against an economic policy of sovereign governments oriented towards
[02:39:07.273 --> 02:39:10.576]  The general welfare and you know European banking.
[02:39:10.997 --> 02:39:16.742]  It's a remnant of a feudal society in which private interests as defined by the ancient Venetian cartels.
[02:39:17.022 --> 02:39:23.368]  You have talked about this before Venetian black mobility of the Lombard League which went down on Dark Age in the 14th century.
[02:39:23.689 --> 02:39:28.213]  And this is something that these people have tried to resuscitate so many times over and again.
[02:39:28.593 --> 02:39:45.317]  They're destroying or trying to destroy every nation-state in the world, countries, and create this pan-world economic order, which they want to call World Company Limited, at the expense of nation-states, at the expense of independent countries and peoples of nations.
[02:39:49.594 --> 02:39:54.298]  Daniel, obviously they didn't want this exposed and there's famous quotes.
[02:39:54.439 --> 02:40:02.987]  We'll put one on screen of David Rockefeller thanking mainstream media at a Trilateral Commission meeting that's minutes were made public.
[02:40:04.076 --> 02:40:05.057]  In 2004.
[02:40:06.018 --> 02:40:16.008]  We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promise of discretion for almost 40 years.
[02:40:16.048 --> 02:40:19.931]  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world.
[02:40:21.124 --> 02:40:21.965]  See, it's their plan.
[02:40:22.745 --> 02:40:23.626]  And we're not in it, folks.
[02:40:24.306 --> 02:40:31.250]  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years.
[02:40:31.611 --> 02:40:36.134]  But the world is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government.
[02:40:36.614 --> 02:40:45.600]  The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practice in past centuries.
[02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:48.242]  Trilateral Commission meeting address in 1991.
[02:40:48.322 --> 02:40:50.864]  Again, it didn't come out until the mid-2000s.
[02:40:51.324 --> 02:40:54.647]  But the whole point is, these guys openly talk like this now.
[02:40:55.308 --> 02:41:03.455]  And my issue is, any elite that wants Common Core taught, where 2 plus 2 equals 5, is a very evil elite.
[02:41:03.495 --> 02:41:04.576]  I mean, they want us to come down.
[02:41:04.616 --> 02:41:07.398]  They want us in a neo-feudalistic area.
[02:41:07.598 --> 02:41:10.161]  And people need to know, this is the big threat.
[02:41:10.181 --> 02:41:10.901]  So let me ask you this.
[02:41:10.921 --> 02:41:13.223]  I want you to comment on what I just said, if you agree or disagree.
[02:41:14.355 --> 02:41:26.365]  But you said in 2007, 2006, we put in a film in 2007 that they would implode in two years the housing market and all the rest of this and that indeed happened.
[02:41:27.326 --> 02:41:28.446]  And you had that from your source.
[02:41:28.487 --> 02:41:29.607]  I mean, they want to hurt people.
[02:41:29.647 --> 02:41:30.668]  They want to make us poor.
[02:41:31.149 --> 02:41:34.852]  I think people need to realize that they want us poor to control us.
[02:41:34.932 --> 02:41:36.213]  It's neo-feudalism, correct?
[02:41:37.117 --> 02:41:52.392]  Absolutely, and one of the things I was jotting down as we're in the last break is something else, which I know they're going to be talking about, although I don't have it as an item, a discussion item on the agenda, is the derivatives bubble.
[02:41:52.472 --> 02:42:00.860]  The global derivatives bubble today is 20% bigger than it was just before the last financial economic crash, which we suffered in 2008.
[02:42:02.685 --> 02:42:12.330]  And it's important because, as you said, the whole thing of deindustrialization, zero growth, demand destruction, you need to destroy demand if you want to reduce the world's population.
[02:42:12.430 --> 02:42:13.511]  Progress and development.
[02:42:14.818 --> 02:42:16.819]  is directly proportional to population density.
[02:42:16.859 --> 02:42:20.760]  So if we have progress, we have technological development, we're going to have more people.
[02:42:21.620 --> 02:42:28.223]  You need to have progress and development, especially the technology to support, you know, the 7 billion people we have on the planet today.
[02:42:28.283 --> 02:42:33.585]  If you don't have that, there's going to come a point where you're going to have a collapse and a breakdown of the population.
[02:42:33.945 --> 02:42:37.466]  And a great example of this de-industrialization today is Detroit.
[02:42:37.946 --> 02:42:42.048]  You know, this is what, you know, this is their poster child for the entire world.
[02:42:42.308 --> 02:42:42.408]  So
[02:42:42.728 --> 02:42:48.632]  The fact is that the derivatives bubble today is bigger than it has ever been before and it could explode at any point.
[02:42:49.152 --> 02:43:00.300]  I want to very quickly, if we have about a minute, to explain to people how this derivative bubble works and why it's being actually pushed by the elite to self-destruct.
[02:43:02.895 --> 02:43:03.295]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:03.355 --> 02:43:04.016]  Please break it down.
[02:43:04.056 --> 02:43:12.221]  We have an article up on Infowars.com today by Zero Hedge breaking down that it's reached an all-time mega high since 2008.
[02:43:33.355 --> 02:43:34.455]  It's a great way to do that.
[02:43:34.495 --> 02:43:36.436]  It's like creating a game casino table.
[02:43:36.856 --> 02:43:43.518]  And derivatives are side bets on the movements of various things like bonds, for example, the value of bonds, interest rates, currency rates.
[02:43:43.838 --> 02:43:48.859]  So, you speculate on these things and you can bet on how the speculation is going to go.
[02:43:49.159 --> 02:43:52.760]  So, basically, you pile derivatives on top of derivatives on top of derivatives.
[02:43:53.140 --> 02:43:55.701]  And a good example of that is, of course, the mortgage market.
[02:43:56.061 --> 02:44:04.770]  Which everyone is now very familiar with, which had mortgages, which were used to back derivatives, at least theoretically back them.
[02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:12.578]  But the notion value of derivatives, the dollar amount of the derivatives that were created were much more than the value of the mortgages.
[02:44:12.918 --> 02:44:18.284]  So you use the mortgages as a fuel to fuel these derivative machines, which then leveraged it
[02:44:18.564 --> 02:44:18.945]  We're good to go.
[02:44:35.965 --> 02:44:40.969]  Documentary, when we met at the Believer Conference in Canada, Ottawa, in 2006.
[02:44:41.649 --> 02:44:45.672]  And needless to say, 2007, my words were prophetic, the whole thing just exploded.
[02:44:45.692 --> 02:44:51.196]  And needless to say, it's going to explode again, because the idea is to destroy the world economy on purpose.
[02:44:51.536 --> 02:44:56.320]  And the people who think that that can't be the case, because needless to say, if they do that, the elite will suffer as well.
[02:44:56.660 --> 02:44:59.162]  They will not suffer, they already control the entire planet.
[02:44:59.562 --> 02:45:02.244]  What they need to do is reduce the world's population.
[02:45:02.264 --> 02:45:07.568]  And the way to do that is to reduce wealth, real wealth, real economy.
[02:45:07.968 --> 02:45:11.030]  And that's why you de-industrialize the economy.
[02:45:11.331 --> 02:45:12.952]  That's why you de-industrialize the world.
[02:45:13.232 --> 02:45:15.474]  That's where the terminology zero growth comes in.
[02:45:15.954 --> 02:45:18.898]  And if people are interested, you can Google the terminology Zero Growth.
[02:45:19.258 --> 02:45:25.326]  And you'll be surprised how often these words appear on the front pages of the world's leading periodicals.
[02:45:25.767 --> 02:45:27.689]  It's not there because somebody made a boo-boo.
[02:45:27.709 --> 02:45:32.376]  It's there because they want you to know subliminally that they're doing this on purpose.
[02:45:34.804 --> 02:45:49.598]  Well that's right, and under Agenda 21, and so many of their public statements under Cloward and Piven, you name it, they admit they want to make us poor so that only government controls, through corporations, the jobs you can get.
[02:45:49.658 --> 02:45:52.421]  They call it privatization, it's really the opposite.
[02:45:53.261 --> 02:45:55.223]  And then they can pick the winners and losers.
[02:45:56.204 --> 02:46:06.592]  And they are exempt from the regulations that they put on transportation, law enforcement, agriculture, banking, manufacturing, construction, education, immigration, military.
[02:46:07.272 --> 02:46:10.195]  It's only a two-tiered system that allows all this to happen.
[02:46:11.115 --> 02:46:22.604]  And that's why they promote racial division in all this and political correctness is they need to divide all of us while they're busy really being the ultimate discriminatory group.
[02:46:25.316 --> 02:46:26.517]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:46:27.578 --> 02:46:30.260]  You explained it very well in Endgame.
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:30.920]  Very, very well.
[02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:39.607]  If you haven't seen the film, make sure you get a hands-on copy of Alex's film Endgame.
[02:46:39.647 --> 02:46:40.568]  It's an amazing film.
[02:46:40.688 --> 02:46:42.389]  I think it's like three hours long.
[02:46:43.130 --> 02:46:43.770]  Is it not, Alex?
[02:46:45.731 --> 02:46:47.112]  It's really about three films in one.
[02:46:47.152 --> 02:46:49.132]  We just call it Endgame.
[02:46:49.212 --> 02:46:58.255]  It's an amazing compendium of exactly how this whole thing is being put together by whom we have some amazing documentary images and footage.
[02:46:58.756 --> 02:47:05.878]  And I don't know where you got some of the photographs and film footage, but boy... Yeah, we got it from you, and you did a great job.
[02:47:05.898 --> 02:47:08.559]  There's some stuff there which I certainly didn't give you, but...
[02:47:09.719 --> 02:47:13.883]  Old footage from, you know, from the early part of the century and, uh, boy, an amazing film.
[02:47:13.903 --> 02:47:15.585]  You need to see it if you haven't seen it yet.
[02:47:16.306 --> 02:47:19.970]  Well, I'll tell you, Daniel, I don't know how you do it whenever we'll be there with a telephoto lens.
[02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:25.635]  You'll go, that's, that's such and such, that's such and such, and then it always turns out to be accurate.
[02:47:26.316 --> 02:47:31.742]  Um, how important is it the people that, that are going to be there who won't be on the list?
[02:47:34.087 --> 02:47:44.995]  You know, I tell you that since, you know, Jim has done amazing work on uncovering, you know, Bilderberg and their influence.
[02:47:45.575 --> 02:47:53.981]  But, you know, since my book came out, The True Story of the Bilderberg Group, which, you know, you sold and thank you so much for promoting my book on your site and, you know, in your shows.
[02:47:54.422 --> 02:48:00.126]  But it's got to the point right now where hiding, you know, the existence of Bilderberg has become silly.
[02:48:00.666 --> 02:48:08.068]  It doesn't make any sense, which is one of the reasons, you know, they decided, the Bilderbergs decided, to actually put up their own webpage.
[02:48:08.428 --> 02:48:11.329]  They say, you know, if somebody's going to talk about us, we might as well do it ourselves.
[02:48:11.889 --> 02:48:20.171]  You know, they control the information, most of it is fairly accurate, and most of the people attend, you know, are there, and occasionally someone might not be on the list.
[02:48:20.491 --> 02:48:21.351]  But I tell you what, you know,
[02:48:22.071 --> 02:48:26.073]  For the exception of one or two people, most of them are on the list of the attendees.
[02:48:26.413 --> 02:48:33.536]  What is important is to understand, again, that this is real, that the people who are there are important.
[02:48:33.876 --> 02:48:38.678]  Although, again, Bilderberg is not the, you know, epics of any pyramid, you know, it's more of a conveyor belt.
[02:48:39.138 --> 02:48:46.421]  The real decision-making is done at even higher levels than Bilderberg or trilateral commission meetings, you know, Council on Foreign Relations, but it's an important element.
[02:48:46.741 --> 02:48:51.025]  Sure, it's a major coordinating operation, as you said, conveyor belting all the groups.
[02:48:51.085 --> 02:48:57.830]  In fact, we've confirmed that some of the Bilderberg steering meetings will be held privately right after the official trilateral meeting.
[02:48:58.070 --> 02:48:59.852]  So as you said, they kind of nest together.
[02:48:59.872 --> 02:49:02.054]  I think you used the term Russian dolls.
[02:49:03.224 --> 02:49:03.624]  Exactly.
[02:49:03.644 --> 02:49:05.265]  I mean, you're talking about Matryoshkas, obviously.
[02:49:05.285 --> 02:49:14.251]  But the point is, Bilderberg has always enjoyed their secrecy or their privacy, no?
[02:49:14.651 --> 02:49:18.594]  But it's gotten to the point where they can't hide any longer.
[02:49:18.634 --> 02:49:23.337]  What is important to understand, again, a bit of a background, that Bilderberg today is
[02:49:23.897 --> 02:49:28.219]  A bit less important than it was 40, 50 years ago, just because of the people who attend.
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:34.062]  Again, you cannot compare the initial original Bilderberg attendees from, you know, 1950s and 1960s.
[02:49:34.443 --> 02:49:41.566]  These are the people, you know, who were born before the, you know, the end of the 19th century, who went through the First World War, you know, went through the Second World War.
[02:49:41.586 --> 02:49:43.427]  A lot of them were self-made, you know, men.
[02:49:43.908 --> 02:49:48.050]  And, you know, they built empires out of nothing, such as you talk about the Rockefellers, for example.
[02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:55.153]  And so these people, you know, they were steeped in world politics at a level which today simply is just not feasible.
[02:49:56.714 --> 02:50:01.476]  But, you know, it was a very important element of the oligarchical structures of the Cold War period.
[02:50:02.096 --> 02:50:13.782]  And it was important because what it meant was that it was a vehicle, Bilderberg meetings, through which private financier oligarchical interests were able to impose their policies on what is nominally sovereign governments.
[02:50:14.122 --> 02:50:16.543]  Now, what is interesting about the origins of Bilderberg
[02:50:17.774 --> 02:50:25.796]  Is that, uh, the biggest scandal part of it was that it was heavily, very heavily populated by people who come out of the World War II Nazi apparatus.
[02:50:25.836 --> 02:50:26.177]  That's right.
[02:50:26.197 --> 02:50:28.617]  Who were basically cleaned up and dusted off.
[02:50:28.817 --> 02:50:32.158]  You know, people such as Prince Bernard, who was, you know, the face.
[02:50:32.298 --> 02:50:35.459]  And who had giant hidden troves of the raw blood of Europe.
[02:50:35.479 --> 02:50:40.741]  I want to ask you about that, because I know you've written extensively about that, about all the art and the gold.
[02:50:40.801 --> 02:50:43.542]  I mean, just tens of trillions of today's dollars or euros.
[02:50:44.082 --> 02:50:45.283]  Final segment with Daniel Esselen.
[02:50:45.303 --> 02:50:48.224]  We've got several special reports that are going to be on the nightly news tonight.
[02:50:48.244 --> 02:50:55.969]  Looking back at Bilderberg, looking forward, new intel being broken right now at Infowars.com by Paul Watson and our reporters.
[02:50:56.629 --> 02:50:57.410]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:57.510 --> 02:50:59.671]  The official list is now on Infowars.com.

[02:54:04.884 --> 02:54:08.568]  I'm going to do five minutes of overdrive after Daniel leaves us here in about six minutes.
[02:54:09.469 --> 02:54:22.221]  And I'm just going to play a compilation, a video we'll also post on Infowars.com, titled Bilderberg Picked Obama, or Bilderberg Made Obama.
[02:54:22.462 --> 02:54:23.863]  What did I say the headline should be?
[02:54:23.883 --> 02:54:24.504]  It was really good.
[02:54:27.006 --> 02:54:28.468]  How Bilderberg Made Obama.
[02:54:29.386 --> 02:54:29.926]  Something like that.
[02:54:31.147 --> 02:54:33.328]  It's five minutes long, it'll fit in the segment just perfectly.
[02:54:33.829 --> 02:54:41.153]  We'll have a bunch of stuff like this looking back in the years past, and then forward with breaking stuff from Watson tonight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:54:41.853 --> 02:54:57.342]  Please don't forget, this hour was brought to you by great sponsors with their non-GMO, super high quality, storable food, MyPatriotSupply.com, forward slash Alex, best storable food out there, and it has a great price, and their supporters of this transmission, a win-win-win, MyPatriotSupply.com,
[02:55:01.624 --> 02:55:11.810]  Please don't forget that we have Esalen's excellent new book on transhumanism available at Infowars.com.
[02:55:12.391 --> 02:55:16.013]  Now Daniel, before the break I was asking you when you came back to break down
[02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:20.933]  I don't remember exactly what I was asking to break down, I guess so.
[02:55:20.993 --> 02:55:21.694]  A golden lily.
[02:55:21.714 --> 02:55:29.463]  I think you mentioned golden lily operation, which went down the, you know, the gold operation in the Second World War by the Nazis.
[02:55:29.483 --> 02:55:32.826]  That's right, the missing Nazi loot and all the artwork and all the rest of it.
[02:55:33.067 --> 02:55:36.150]  That's right, because you see a big Nazi contingent with Bilderberg.
[02:55:36.190 --> 02:55:36.771]  Please continue.
[02:55:37.688 --> 02:55:56.356]  There's again, you know, the two individuals, the key individuals, who are members of the Bilderberg, right from the beginning, Prince Bernard, one of the founders, SS carrying card member, and also Walter Hallstein, who's the first president of the European Commission, and the man, the lawyer, Nazi lawyer, whose writings
[02:55:57.737 --> 02:56:04.859]  Justified or convinced Hitler that he had the justification necessary to create the concentration camps all across Europe.
[02:56:05.159 --> 02:56:09.560]  So these are the two individuals who were very, very much involved in Bilderberg from the very, very beginning.
[02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:11.661]  And that's something that Bilderberg has tried to hide.
[02:56:11.701 --> 02:56:20.063]  And if you look at some of the individuals which you have today in key positions such as Herman Van Rompuy, Marosso Schultz,
[02:56:20.623 --> 02:56:21.424]  Yeah.
[02:56:40.536 --> 02:56:44.158]  If we believe the actual numbers, there's 140,000 metric tons of gold in the world.
[02:56:44.538 --> 02:56:53.604]  Where there's in fact, there's at least a million and a half metric tons of gold as a result of stolen loot by the Japanese and the Germans in the Second World War.
[02:56:53.624 --> 02:57:02.649]  Now if this information ever came out, that gold is as worthy as a common rock you find on the street, the entire world's financial markets will collapse onto itself.
[02:57:02.909 --> 02:57:06.592]  And that's one of the reasons why most of this loot is still hidden in the
[02:57:07.572 --> 02:57:07.732]  I think?
[02:57:27.975 --> 02:57:28.095]  Wow!
[02:57:56.815 --> 02:57:57.475]  That's right.
[02:57:57.496 --> 02:57:58.696]  Daniel, we're out of time.
[02:57:58.716 --> 02:58:02.639]  Will you promise to come back on in the aftermath of Bilderberg to track him?
[02:58:12.185 --> 02:58:12.705]  Absolutely.
[02:58:12.885 --> 02:58:14.727]  We'll have all the information from our sources.
[02:58:15.267 --> 02:58:17.788]  And people can follow me on my Twitter account.
[02:58:17.868 --> 02:58:20.050]  It's at Estulin Daniel.
[02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:22.571]  And please keep listening to Alex Jones.
[02:58:22.591 --> 02:58:27.494]  He's one of the few sources out there who really gets the information on Bilderberg more than anybody else.
[02:58:27.694 --> 02:58:28.775]  And your website's excellent.
[02:58:28.795 --> 02:58:29.655]  It's in Spanish as well.
[02:58:29.675 --> 02:58:30.496]  Give that out for folks.
[02:58:30.736 --> 02:58:32.397]  Yeah, it's danielestulent.com.
[02:58:32.877 --> 02:58:34.418]  My Twitter is Estulent Daniel.
[02:58:34.518 --> 02:58:40.461]  And, uh, you know, when we come back, maybe after the Bilderberg Conference is over, we're almost done with my Bilderberg documentary.
[02:58:40.481 --> 02:58:42.322]  That's going to be out in about... Can't wait, Daniel.
[02:58:42.382 --> 02:58:42.883]  Thank you.
[02:58:43.163 --> 02:58:44.504]  Let's get you back on next week.
[02:58:44.584 --> 02:58:44.984]  Thank you.
[02:58:46.045 --> 02:58:46.885]  Can't wait to see that.
[02:58:46.905 --> 02:58:48.826]  We'll be right back with some overdrive and a special report.
[02:58:51.570 --> 02:58:59.434]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[02:58:59.674 --> 02:59:01.755]  All the major networks are state-run.
[02:59:01.896 --> 02:59:04.537]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[02:59:04.597 --> 02:59:08.719]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[02:59:09.019 --> 02:59:12.181]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[02:59:12.201 --> 02:59:19.485]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:59:19.645 --> 02:59:23.768]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[02:59:23.968 --> 02:59:25.669]  We are the true media.
[02:59:25.749 --> 02:59:28.350]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[02:59:28.450 --> 02:59:32.093]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[02:59:32.213 --> 02:59:36.335]  Join us at InfoWarsNews.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:36.555 --> 02:59:39.437]  Members can share their memberships with up to 11 people.
[02:59:39.517 --> 02:59:42.659]  By subscribing, you will literally be buying war bonds.
[02:59:42.899 --> 02:59:44.980]  Alright folks, we're in Overdrive covering Bilderberg 2014.
[02:59:45.040 --> 02:59:45.580]  It is treason.
[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:19.143]  We're taking our destiny back!
[03:00:19.203 --> 03:00:21.865]  You're not our gods or our masters!
[03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:53.609]  We witnessed at least seven convoys of armed secret service entering the Westfields Marriott, and internal sources confirmed that both candidates did attend at least one meeting inside the conference.
[03:00:55.951 --> 03:01:07.379]  While the Bilderberg Group was 100% successful in 2008 at keeping their name out of the mainstream media, they did not fare as well when it came to the exploding independent press.
[03:01:09.170 --> 03:01:15.996]  During the entire two-day event, anti-New World Order protesters and alternative media encircled the hotel.
[03:01:17.778 --> 03:01:20.020]  You are being exposed everywhere!
[03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:24.423]  From David Rockefeller, from John Edwards, from Bill Clinton!
[03:01:24.684 --> 03:01:26.966]  Your game of secrecy is over!
[03:01:26.986 --> 03:01:28.247]  You're gonna pay!
[03:01:28.267 --> 03:01:29.188]  Get a game at the park!
[03:01:29.208 --> 03:01:32.030]  You piece of junk!
[03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:33.171]  You piece of trash!
[03:01:33.191 --> 03:01:34.452]  This is Bernanke, man!
[03:01:34.833 --> 03:01:36.134]  Bernanke, you're going down!
[03:01:51.375 --> 03:01:54.617]  Builderberg always insists on a media blackout.
[03:01:55.318 --> 03:02:00.921]  By June of 2008, we had already figured out that Barack Obama was the elite's puppet of choice.
[03:02:01.362 --> 03:02:10.568]  The national media claimed that during the weekend the Bilderberg group was scheduled to meet, that Obama had speaking engagements set for Chicago and the Midwest.
[03:02:10.988 --> 03:02:11.629]  We knew better.
[03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:22.352]  In a classic bait-and-switch, the Obama campaign told the press corps to get on Obama's campaign plane and that Obama would join them on the flight to Chicago.
[03:02:22.732 --> 03:02:25.573]  Campaign staff then slammed the door shut.
[03:02:25.993 --> 03:02:32.055]  The fawning press had been shanghaied as Obama's campaign aircraft lifted off without Obama.
[03:02:32.952 --> 03:02:42.078]  Robert, why were we not told about this meeting and that the Senator wouldn't be on our flight until the doors were shut and we were about to taxi to take off?
[03:02:42.999 --> 03:02:46.381]  Again, we had a desire.
[03:02:46.842 --> 03:02:49.804]  Senator Obama had a desire to do some meetings.
[03:02:49.884 --> 03:02:53.246]  Others have a desire to meet with him tonight in a private way.
[03:02:53.366 --> 03:02:54.247]  So we kidnapped you.
[03:02:54.667 --> 03:02:55.948]  We set up these meetings.
[03:02:56.268 --> 03:02:57.629]  They're being done tonight.
[03:03:02.335 --> 03:03:08.118]  I'm not going to get into all the details of the meetings.
[03:03:08.318 --> 03:03:14.041]  I don't know that I've got a ton more different answers for all of your questions.
[03:03:20.214 --> 03:03:23.938]  Initially, it was believed that the secret meeting took place at Clinton's Washington, D.C.
[03:03:23.979 --> 03:03:24.219]  home.
[03:03:24.599 --> 03:03:28.604]  Obama's spokesman denied that, but won't confirm where the former rivals met.
[03:03:29.044 --> 03:03:31.708]  He also declined to comment on their topics of discussion.
[03:03:32.731 --> 03:03:39.653]  For a day and a half, the mainstream media engaged in a wild goose chase, trying to find out where Hillary and Obama had gone.
[03:03:40.033 --> 03:03:47.056]  Three cover stories later, the corporate press had to admit they had no idea where the two candidates had gone.
[03:03:47.556 --> 03:03:51.097]  And to this day, Clinton and Obama aren't talking.
[03:03:51.717 --> 03:03:59.100]  Plenty of sources knew about this meeting, told us and others that it was at Hillary Clinton's house, but clearly it wasn't.
[03:03:59.628 --> 03:04:04.090]  The Bilderberg Group sits at the top of the world power structure.
[03:04:04.110 --> 03:04:09.753]  125 of the richest and most influential individuals on the globe make up its membership.
[03:04:11.954 --> 03:04:17.717]  From Istanbul, Turkey to Chantilly, Virginia, we have tracked the elusive Bilderberg Group.
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:22.720]  Treason!
[03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:23.760]  Treason!
[03:04:24.341 --> 03:04:24.941]  Treason!
[03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:25.962]  Treason!
[03:04:26.522 --> 03:04:27.042]  Treason!
[03:04:27.542 --> 03:04:27.823]  Treason!
[03:04:27.843 --> 03:04:28.303]  Treason!
[03:04:31.419 --> 03:04:41.511]  I remember that was in 2000 and
[03:04:45.865 --> 03:04:48.387]  It was two years ago, so it was like 2012 that that happened.
[03:04:48.867 --> 03:04:54.070]  And it was so loud, with like a thousand people chanting treason, that my ears were ringing for two weeks.
[03:04:54.190 --> 03:04:56.231]  But that's real audio, folks, just heard there.
[03:04:56.792 --> 03:04:58.693]  A bunch of those clips and stuff coming up tomorrow, too.
[03:04:59.213 --> 03:05:00.354]  And live reports from Bilderberg.
[03:05:02.170 --> 03:05:02.930]  I don't know what it is.
[03:05:03.150 --> 03:05:04.891]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[03:05:05.031 --> 03:05:08.992]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[03:05:09.152 --> 03:05:10.392]  It's like I don't even exist.
[03:05:10.752 --> 03:05:12.573]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[03:05:12.713 --> 03:05:13.893]  Does this seem familiar?
[03:05:14.073 --> 03:05:16.674]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[03:05:16.794 --> 03:05:22.036]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[03:05:22.216 --> 03:05:27.137]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[03:05:27.277 --> 03:05:29.678]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[03:05:29.978 --> 03:05:30.438]  Look it up.
[03:05:30.659 --> 03:05:37.343]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.
[03:05:37.523 --> 03:05:42.646]  Energize the man in your life with Super Male Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
