[00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:36.736]  It saddens me again to appear in public with the Ellis family, with the Gomez family, with the Tortoise family, and all the families who have lost children to these rogue terrorist cops that you let still walk our streets and terrorize the public.
[00:00:43.493 --> 00:01:07.382]  Just as the community in Bunkerville rallied around Cliven Bundy after snipers pointed weapons at people all week, and after several confrontations where the BLM agents got violent, in one case attacking a woman from behind and throwing her to the ground, the same sort of thing is now happening in Albuquerque, where an angry crowd showed up to a city council meeting, threatening to arrest the sheriff, taking the seats of the city council.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.021]  Now, in both cases, there was no violence committed by the public, but they clearly are fed up with the violence that's being committed against them.
[00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:17.942]  Why the people of Albuquerque fed up?
[00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:27.343]  Well, as we reported before, more people have been killed by their police department than by the New York City Police Department, even though New York City has 16 times the number of people.
[00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:35.205]  The violent history of the Albuquerque Police Department was brought to national attention about five weeks ago when a homeless man was shot to death
[00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.671]  We're good to go.
[00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:57.770]  Now one of the three people that was killed in the last five weeks was 19-year-old Mary Hawks.
[00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.452]  Now her case involved the search for a stolen pickup truck.
[00:02:01.732 --> 00:02:06.055]  Documents in the truck led them to Mary Hawks and to a trailer park.
[00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.537]  They conduct a 5 a.m.
[00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:12.319]  raid on this trailer park as if they're looking for a terrorist.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.121]  They block access in and out of the trailer park.
[00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:21.886]  They announce on loudspeakers for no one to leave their homes, to shut their windows, and that they're going to release dogs.
[00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:27.291]  As 19-year-old Mary Hawks flees, she is shot dead by an APD officer.
[00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:31.354]  And there's no video to support his story that she pointed a gun at him.
[00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:33.675]  No video from the shooter's camera.
[00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:36.257]  No video from the officers with him.
[00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:42.481]  Now it's surprising that there's no video of the incident because the APD is all about lapel cameras.
[00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:50.787]  Having placed one of the highest dollar value orders for police cameras in the country, two million dollars worth of cameras bought from Taser.
[00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:52.208]  And the former police chief
[00:02:52.708 --> 00:03:01.157]  Schultz, who now works for Taser, is being investigated by a local news station for his cozy relationship with the company, while still police chief.
[00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:10.207]  Emails allegedly show the police chief being given speaking engagements and perhaps employment in exchange for influence peddling.
[00:03:10.908 --> 00:03:15.411]  He promises that he's going to grease things for Taser with the APD.
[00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:22.816]  What we're seeing now with the police industrial complex mirrors what we've seen for decades with the military industrial complex.
[00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:33.322]  That people who are high-ranking officers and who make purchasing decisions will then retire and go to work for the very companies that are military contractors.
[00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:37.525]  And make no mistake about it, Taser is a military contractor.
[00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:39.927]  It's the militarization of our police.
[00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:48.691]  And when we look at this state-of-the-art $2 million camera technology that they've sold them, how likely is it that there was no recording of this event?
[00:03:49.051 --> 00:04:02.638]  The capability to record an entire shift with only a 40% battery charge, with a 30-second buffer once he starts recording, even if he had it in standby, it makes it pretty hard to believe that he didn't really record this incident.
[00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:14.555]  Now the current police chief, Chief Eden, stopped short of calling the lack of footage a malfunction and declined to say whether the officer told investigators that he turned the camera on or not.
[00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:20.338]  He says he's going to send it to the manufacturer for forensic analysis to see if it functioned properly.
[00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:27.201]  Who knows, maybe he can get former police chief Schultz, who now works for Taser, to help him with that forensic investigation.
[00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:33.805]  Don't hold your breath about a detailed investigation of yet another police shooting in Albuquerque.
[00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:37.267]  The problems there are long-lasting and systemic.
[00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:51.997]  And as we consider the militarization of the police and the creation of yet another profit center for the industrial-military complex, as they turn our cities into war zones, the same way they did this trailer park where Mary Hawks was shot.
[00:04:52.837 --> 00:04:54.558]  Over a stolen truck.
[00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:56.699]  They were not hunting down a murderer.
[00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.620]  They were not hunting down a terrorist.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.723]  But they were going to lock down the entire trailer park and use dogs going house to house searching.
[00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:10.986]  Are the American people in Bunkerville and Albuquerque beginning to realize who the real domestic terrorists are?
[00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:21.306]  The facts are in.
[00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:24.028]  The studies are legion.
[00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:38.981]  Sodium fluoride and other members of the fluorine family that are added to western water supplies are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the people that drink it.
[00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:44.566]  So the question is, why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:05:45.346 --> 00:05:53.173]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:05:53.513 --> 00:06:03.201]  We developed the Fluoride Shield to be the highest quality, highest standards because I use it every day and my family uses it every single day.
[00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:09.186]  Let's take a closer look at the ingredients that make up this special proprietary formula.
[00:06:09.927 --> 00:06:21.020]  Tamarind has been celebrated for its ability to immobilize toxic fluoride residues, while zeolites have a long history of attracting and holding toxic compounds.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.664]  Interfolvic acid, an excellent cleansing agent,
[00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:32.752]  Then we added the highest quality shilajit, a rare compound that is collected from the high mountains of the Himalayas.
[00:06:32.932 --> 00:06:42.001]  We topped it all off with the powerhouse herb cilantro that is intended to mobilize fluoride and other dangerous compounds for removal from the body.
[00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:48.247]  And the final touch to energize this formula is our proprietary nascent iodine.
[00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:53.968]  And as always, consult your physician as well because that is important.
[00:06:54.408 --> 00:07:08.895]  And finally, Fluoride Shield, Survival Shield, and all the products at Infowarslife.com grew out of my quest to try to find the very best compounds from God's cornucopia to protect myself and my family.
[00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:14.502]  And from our research, I believe we are bringing you the best, highest quality products.
[00:07:14.742 --> 00:07:19.228]  And you have that commitment from Alex Jones and the entire InfoWars crew.
