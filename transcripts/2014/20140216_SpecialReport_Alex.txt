[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:05.593]  We're used to being watched from above downtown, but now officers will be getting video of us on the street level.
[00:00:05.653 --> 00:00:10.836]  They basically described it as a small object that you wouldn't be able to tell apart from something like this metal box.
[00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:11.656]  We're always out there.
[00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:14.418]  We're always watching, whether you think we are or not.
[00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:21.703]  APD hopes to one day partner with businesses around here, get them to purchase the mobile cameras, giving the department access to the video.
[00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:28.207]  The goal is to one day have responding patrol officers be able to pull up surveillance video from anywhere around town.
[00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:29.647]  Well, isn't that great?
[00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:36.370]  Recently, InfoWars traveled to the New York, New Jersey area to expose the police state surrounding the Super Bowl.
[00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:46.394]  Aside from the TSA checking bags in the train stations, as well as rifle-toting guards, we saw plenty of surveillance cameras just like we have in the city of Austin.
[00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:49.475]  And if you love your 4th Amendment being trifled with,
[00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:53.317]  You'll say that the cameras stop crime and make you feel safe.
[00:00:53.777 --> 00:01:02.361]  You can keep on feeling safe because in case you missed it, here's a viral YouTube video of an attack that happened just blocks away from the Austin Police Department.
[00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.522]  This was a few weeks ago.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.107]  And I will say for the most part, personally, when I go downtown, I feel pretty safe and not threatened by anything.
[00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:17.129]  But, you know, these things can happen.
[00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.755]  People have this notion that if there are more cameras around, they'll be safer.
[00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:26.762]  Well, I went to that area to check it out for myself, and there's a camera right there.
[00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:33.038]  Local news reports that APD has over 40 cameras in the downtown area.
[00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.119]  The surveillance state is growing.
[00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:41.621]  In the Boston area, buses are now live streaming to police, courtesy of Homeland Security.
[00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:46.142]  There is no audio, but there are also cameras on the exterior of the buses.
[00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:49.664]  The system cost 6.9 million dollars.
[00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:51.746]  All of it came from Homeland Security.
[00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:58.831]  Right now, about 10 buses are outfitted, but by the summer, more than 225 will have these sophisticated cameras.
[00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:06.717]  80 transit police cruisers will soon have touchscreens like this, so officers can look live, right into a bus that they may be following.
[00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:13.306]  A system like that could definitely have its uses, but I'm not one to discount the use of violating your privacy.
[00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:22.240]  And with the Austin police chief saying that he wants to use public cameras for police use, there will be little privacy left in downtown Austin, Texas.
[00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:33.391]  We know that there's a tremendous number of cameras in the private sector, and right now we're working to try to get those private cameras in public places tied into our system.
[00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:37.013]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:38.153]  We're always out there.
[00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:40.875]  We're always watching, whether you think we are or not.
[00:02:49.534 --> 00:02:53.935]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:56.496]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:02:56.816 --> 00:03:06.519]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
