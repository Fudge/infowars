[00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:14.886]  I'll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the people's business.
[00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:19.609]  As Justice Louise Brandeis once said, sunlight is the greatest disinfectant.
[00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:30.540]  And as president, I'm going to make it impossible for congressmen or lobbyists to slip port barrel projects or corporate welfare into laws when no one's looking.
[00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:36.704]  Because when I'm president, meetings where laws are written will be more open to the public, no more secrecy.
[00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:38.825]  That's a commitment I make to you as president.
[00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:45.629]  No more secrecy.
[00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:52.925]  At this very moment, there are upwards of 50,000 brand new illegal aliens roaming around the United States.
[00:00:53.665 --> 00:01:00.529]  And not only does the administration that funded their arrival not know where they are, they aren't going to tell you.
[00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.050]  Why would they?
[00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.151]  You are the enemy.
[00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.993]  Let us all remember who the real enemy is.
[00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:10.795]  And the real enemy is the Tea Party!
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.864]  The vets know it's a PSYOP and aren't going to stop.
[00:01:17.404 --> 00:01:19.347]  This is only going to get worse once it starts.
[00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:22.050]  And again, there's no veterans doing anything right now.
[00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.793]  No IEDs, no cops being targeted.
[00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:28.497]  They are literally getting the police to pick a fight with veterans.
[00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:31.000]  They're hardening facilities, putting in infrastructure.
[00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:33.287]  Building their new private internet.
[00:01:33.387 --> 00:01:34.947]  I mean, it's a total takeover.
[00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:40.130]  It's literally, let me not exaggerate, 30 times bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.074]  This secret police state project against America, this treason, this VC French takeover is just mega massive.
[00:01:49.554 --> 00:01:54.737]  Meanwhile, our country is facing a real terrorist threat on its wide open borders.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.842]  Thank you, Obama, for leaving your southern borders open so ISIS can terrorize America.
[00:02:06.222 --> 00:02:19.847]  The widespread exposure of Ebola in the United States is just one undocumented illegal away, and our self-proclaimed transparent president refuses to answer any questions.
[00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:25.989]  We should never forget that we are here as public servants, and public service is a privilege.
[00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:29.106]  It's not about advancing yourself.
[00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:33.808]  It's not about advancing your friends or your corporate clients.
[00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:39.670]  It's not about advancing an ideological agenda or the special interests of any organization.
[00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.913]  Public service is, simply and absolutely, about advancing the interests of Americans.
[00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:52.293]  The men and women in this room understand this and that's why you're here.
[00:02:53.033 --> 00:03:16.465]  Illegal aliens are reaping the rewards of free health care, bus vouchers to any destination in America, unhindered access via the TSA and DHS, transitioning in multi-million dollar taxpayer facilities, educational assistance, and what jobs are left in an economy with 92 million United States citizens
[00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:17.965]  Unemployed.
[00:03:18.606 --> 00:03:29.731]  While it is absolutely unlawful to hire an undocumented worker, the Obama administration reduced the fines by an average of 40 percent, according to an audit released in February of 2014.
[00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:40.656]  Just last month, there were 418 charges of child rapes in North Carolina, home to a wide range of sanctuary cities.
[00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:54.002]  As the alleged rape of American children goes unreported by the mainstream media, it isn't just the president that is blatantly ambiguous concerning the real predicament we all face.
[00:03:54.743 --> 00:04:00.185]  The media colludes unabated as the engineered collapse unfolds.
