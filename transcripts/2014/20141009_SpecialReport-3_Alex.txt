[00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:16.027]  Homeland Security saying that they believe there is an imminent threat being planned and that an attack will take place.
[00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:23.333]  They said that last Friday and again on Sunday in and around El Paso, Fort Bliss, Joint Task Force Six Area.
[00:00:24.193 --> 00:00:24.834]  I want to be clear.
[00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:26.915]  I'm the guy that exposes false flag.
[00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:31.779]  I'm the guy that officially began questioning 9-11 on the day of the event.
[00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:37.988]  I see comments on Infowars saying, you know, Alex, why are you saying there could be a real ISIS threat?
[00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:40.649]  It's going to be a hoax, it's going to be a false flag.
[00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:50.753]  It is a false flag because ISIS has been empowered and funded by NATO and Homeland Security and they'll use an attack to take our liberties.
[00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:57.055]  It does not mean there aren't jihadi nutballs that are coming to attack us.
[00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:05.366]  See, the media always spins it that a false flag means it's totally staged by the government.
[00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:06.364]  No.
[00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:10.806]  Elements of the government can fund terrorists and then let them attack.
[00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:12.747]  Has Rand Paul ever been to Syria?
[00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:14.368]  Has he ever met with ISIS?
[00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:15.529]  Has he ever met with any of these people?
[00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:16.889]  I'm not trying to cause a fight, sir.
[00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:17.190]  No, no, no.
[00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.130]  We're going to have a fight.
[00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.751]  Because it's patently false.
[00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:26.554]  This is the same Rand Paul that said we didn't want to have anything to do with anything to do in the Middle East, by the way.
[00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:28.615]  I don't want to get in a fight with him at all.
[00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:30.096]  But it's not true.
[00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:31.537]  I know these people.
[00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:34.538]  I'm in contact with them all the time.
[00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:35.539]  Let me ask you this.
[00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:36.501]  He is not.
[00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:37.383]  He is not.
[00:01:37.403 --> 00:01:42.055]  I mean, let's remember here, the people we are fighting today, we funded 20 years ago.
[00:01:44.682 --> 00:01:48.343]  And we did it because we were locked in this struggle with the Soviet Union.
[00:01:48.763 --> 00:01:54.805]  They invaded Afghanistan, and we did not want to see them control Central Asia.
[00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:58.005]  And we went to work.
[00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:04.967]  And it was President Reagan, in partnership with the Congress, led by Democrats, who said, you know what?
[00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:06.208]  Sounds like a pretty good idea.
[00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:11.529]  Let's deal with the ISI and the Pakistani military, and let's go recruit these Mujahideen.
[00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.770]  That's great.
[00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.595]  Let's get some to come from Saudi Arabia and other places, importing their Wahhabi brand of Islam, so that we can go beat the Soviet Union.
[00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:24.538]  That's what most false flags are, is opening the door, letting it happen.
[00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.781]  Look at how the British government was in the news two days ago.
[00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:34.465]  It's going to, quote, retrain the jihadis coming back from Syria, because huge amounts of them, tens of thousands, have come out of England.
[00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:36.227]  They're allowed to fly in and out.
[00:02:36.247 --> 00:02:37.908]  They're allowed to have Twitter and Facebook accounts.
[00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:41.870]  They are being protected.
[00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.531]  They're being protected here.
[00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:52.875]  It's in the news today in my stack that radical Islamist terrorists are using the open borders and the open visa program.
[00:02:54.676 --> 00:03:05.221]  Prior to last night, it was running about 73% of the people apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley are OTMs, other than Mexican.
[00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:10.323]  A lot of Central Americans, but really from all over the world.
[00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:15.519]  And, uh, we were informed last night that that number has escalated to 80%.
[00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:20.567]  So, uh, and this is this is a fact.
[00:03:20.607 --> 00:03:22.610]  So most of the people that we encounter here
[00:03:23.496 --> 00:03:27.239]  A larger percentage of them are people from other countries other than Mexico.
[00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.302]  And we're not told about the special interest aliens.
[00:03:30.922 --> 00:03:33.284]  We have had Somalians here.
[00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:40.270]  Once they got on that special alien list, they won't tell us that anymore.
[00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.797]  But there have been Somalians, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chinese, you name it, we've had it here.
[00:03:49.337 --> 00:03:49.917]  We've also
[00:03:51.418 --> 00:04:00.261]  Found evidence that people from these special interest countries, in particular Pakistan and Afghanistan, Iran, are coming through our property.
[00:04:01.462 --> 00:04:06.123]  During one of our Texas Border Volunteer operations last year, we had a group of 10.
[00:04:07.744 --> 00:04:12.765]  We spotted, we followed them, informed the Border Patrol where they were going to come out on the highway.
[00:04:13.226 --> 00:04:15.586]  Border Patrol were not able to respond fast enough.
[00:04:15.626 --> 00:04:17.007]  They climbed the fence.
[00:04:18.155 --> 00:04:22.719]  And loaded up and left and were not caught.
[00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:28.363]  But as one of them was climbing over the fence, he dropped a package.
[00:04:29.764 --> 00:04:32.886]  And that package was an Urdu dictionary.
[00:04:32.986 --> 00:04:37.349]  Urdu is a language spoken in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.570]  And in that
[00:04:40.953 --> 00:04:48.036]  Translation book or do in English there were a lot of phrases circled and outlined Do you speak Spanish?
[00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:49.676]  Do you speak English?
[00:04:50.316 --> 00:05:01.700]  So it's it's easier for them to slip through this private property and that's just one example and more recently Within the past two weeks some Iranian money was found in a bailout vehicle and
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.121]  So, we know they're coming in here.
[00:05:04.302 --> 00:05:18.351]  Besides that Iranian money being found in a bailout vehicle up here, four Syrians, which is not public news yet, but four Syrians were apprehended on the Rio Grande River a couple days ago.
[00:05:18.891 --> 00:05:25.498]  And they now have 12 passenger jets in working order, and have been photographed celebrating with them, basically saying they're gonna kill us with them.
[00:05:42.455 --> 00:05:43.416]  The Islamic Caliphate has risen.
[00:05:43.456 --> 00:05:46.137]  And by God's will, it will not stop.
[00:05:46.198 --> 00:05:50.400]  O youth, if you are men, we are on the ground.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.042]  So don't come to us with planes without planes.
[00:05:53.062 --> 00:05:57.205]  Come with your soldiers, who have shed their tears in Iraq.
[00:05:57.245 --> 00:06:01.147]  And by God's will, we will shed their tears everywhere.
[00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:06.150]  And God willing, in the White House, we will raise the banner of La ilaha illallah.
[00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:09.269]  We found backpacks with Qurans.
[00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:13.990]  Another fellow found a backpack with a prayer rug in it.
[00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:16.131]  You find hypodermic needles.
[00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:17.772]  You find pregnancy tests.
[00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:20.092]  You find everything in the world in this trash.
[00:06:20.493 --> 00:06:23.033]  Another friend had ten Chinese in his yard.
[00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:24.814]  There's Arabs coming.
[00:06:26.955 --> 00:06:32.957]  The Border Patrol said at one point, three out of ten that they apprehended was OTMs, other than Mexicans.
[00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:36.404]  There's all kinds of people.
[00:06:36.464 --> 00:06:38.366]  This is a national security issue.
[00:06:39.407 --> 00:06:41.390]  Everything that you're getting on the media is a lie.
[00:06:41.891 --> 00:06:43.873]  We live this every day, 24 hours.
[00:06:44.894 --> 00:06:46.837]  And it is not secure.
[00:06:47.357 --> 00:06:49.300]  When we got the wall built on our ranch,
[00:06:50.985 --> 00:06:59.447]  It is known as a force multiplier, and immediately they deployed agents that used to patrol the border before the 10, 12, 14 foot wall.
[00:06:59.507 --> 00:07:01.248]  You have 18 foot wall on this side.
[00:07:01.948 --> 00:07:05.509]  They took agents off the border because it's a force multiplier.
[00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:18.952]  ISIS cells that were active in the Juarez area, which is the northern part of Chihuahua State, and that they were moving around over there, that they had, just that there was some activity
[00:07:19.927 --> 00:07:28.451]  And for the sheriffs along the border to be on the alert, for all law enforcement to be on the alert, and to be on the lookout for these people maybe trying to come across.
[00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:31.913]  If they show their ugly head in our area, we'll send them to hell.
[00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:34.614]  And I think the United States need to get busy.
[00:07:35.595 --> 00:07:36.495]  And they need to bomb them.
[00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:38.256]  They need to take them out.
[00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:48.881]  I would like for them to hit them so hard and so often that every time they hear a propeller on a plane or a jet aircraft engine that they urinate down both legs.
[00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:53.050]  Now the reason they picked Juarez could be a strategic move.
[00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.910]  This is just right across the border.
[00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.972]  Juarez is no more than a few miles to my left.
[00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:01.673]  Now we also have, you know, many other buildings in this area that we've talked about.
[00:08:01.693 --> 00:08:02.794]  We have the military base.
[00:08:03.254 --> 00:08:04.395]  FBI has an office.
[00:08:04.415 --> 00:08:09.817]  Do you have any information or any evidence that they're actually coming in the southern border now?
[00:08:10.217 --> 00:08:11.138]  Yes, yes.
[00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:12.298]  Tell me what you know.
[00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:18.361]  I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.
[00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:21.200]  There's nobody talking about it.
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.981]  How do you know that?
[00:08:23.362 --> 00:08:24.862]  Because I've asked the Border Patrol, Greta.
[00:08:25.543 --> 00:08:29.805]  And the Border Patrol, they just let ISIS members come across the border?
[00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:32.187]  No, they caught them at the border.
[00:08:32.227 --> 00:08:34.288]  Therefore, we know that ISIS is coming across the border.
[00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:40.782]  Two Central Texas men arrested on terror-related charges will both have a detention hearing tomorrow afternoon in federal court.
[00:08:40.943 --> 00:08:45.285]  Rahatul Khan and Michael Wolff, both 23, were arrested separately this week.
[00:08:45.665 --> 00:08:48.367]  They're both accused of providing support to terrorists.
[00:08:48.727 --> 00:08:49.688]  Is there synergy?
[00:08:49.888 --> 00:08:50.888]  Is there interaction?
[00:08:51.008 --> 00:08:55.691]  Is there a connection between the Mexican cartels and groups like ISIS?
[00:08:57.572 --> 00:09:02.335]  My opinion is, yes, there seems to be a
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.222]  At least talking to each other.
[00:09:06.823 --> 00:09:07.283]  How much?
[00:09:07.623 --> 00:09:08.143]  I don't know.
[00:09:08.684 --> 00:09:16.349]  But they're using, drug cartels use the same operational plan as terrorist groups do.
[00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:24.635]  People from terrorist countries, countries that are deemed special interest countries, pouring in here undetected.
[00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:27.777]  It's time to step up and shut the border down.
[00:09:28.698 --> 00:09:31.560]  We can shut the border down in Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.901]  That's a big priority.
[00:09:33.413 --> 00:09:35.857]  Our biggest priority needs to be shut down this southwestern border.
[00:09:45.253 --> 00:09:47.515]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:50.637]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
