[00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.180]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.781]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:13.301]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:17.502]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:26.485]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:31.046]  My friends, I am totally wound up on this tenth day
[00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:36.947]  of July 2014 on this Thursday edition.
[00:00:36.947 --> 00:00:39.449]  Obama is in town.
[00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:48.257]  There are helicopters, army helicopters, black helicopters, police helicopters, Secret Service all over downtown.
[00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:49.378]  I was down there this morning.
[00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:51.820]  They were bugging their eyes out at people.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.525]  Anthony Gucciardi lives downtown and had them bugging their eyes out at him just driving down the street.
[00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:03.483]  And I'm getting to the point where if Secret Service says that to me, I'm just going to pull over and get a camera out and say, this isn't North Korea.
[00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:06.845]  You work for a total criminal who we wish no harm upon.
[00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:09.187]  The whole country's a giant fraud now.
[00:01:09.187 --> 00:01:10.688]  The borders are wide open.
[00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:12.769]  Big banks shipping the narcotics.
[00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:14.811]  Aren't you guys supposed to be looking for hookers and blow?
[00:01:17.574 --> 00:01:34.700]  They shut down all of I-35 northbound this morning, and I was watching it on the news, an hour after he'd driven by to some fundraiser from downtown, they still had it shut down, and I was driving to work and saw all the motorcycle cops still blocking the roads.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.241]  Why not demolish the roads permanently?
[00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:40.122]  Why not nuke each city he visits as a sign of respect?
[00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:47.286]  As he gets off his helicopters and is saluted, a globalist publicly funding ISIS to carry out terror attacks.
[00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:54.411]  And he was at Robert Rodriguez, the grand dragon of Mechel Araza's house last night, celebrating the destruction of America.
[00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:55.832]  Here's Leanne McAdoo's report.
[00:01:56.735 --> 00:02:16.421]  Well, Obama is in the neighborhood this week, and rather than visit the border to witness firsthand the crisis that is largely brought on by his failed policies, he is going to be partying it up with people who have paid anywhere from $10,000 to $35,000 to bask in his presence at one of his Democratic fundraisers.
[00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:20.082]  Tonight, he is in Austin, Texas, visiting the home of
[00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:29.284]  Austin-based filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, whose ultra-violent Machete franchise is very pro-illegal immigration.
[00:02:29.284 --> 00:02:49.768]  But instead of portraying illegal immigration in a positive, good-for-the-economy sort of way, Rodriguez's film bolsters support by demonizing a Texas politician who's seeking to tighten border control, and also they portray a Minuteman-style American delighting in shooting a pregnant Mexican woman.
[00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:55.143]  So it's hard to tell if it's a pro-amnesty message or a La Raza cattle call.
[00:03:00.678 --> 00:03:05.279]  And of course, Jessica Alba is going to be one of the special guests at tonight's fundraiser.
[00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.419]  Now, Robert Rodriguez has done a lot for the Latino community.
[00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:20.001]  He's launched the careers of a lot of Latino actors, and as well as his movie, Spy Kids, was one of the first theatrical franchises to feature a Latino family playing superheroes.
[00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:25.762]  They were the first Latinos featured in a heroic role, and Rodriguez did insist on that.
[00:03:25.762 --> 00:03:29.443]  Also, Rodriguez is a member of the National
[00:03:29.983 --> 00:03:31.564]  Council of La Raza.
[00:03:31.564 --> 00:03:40.750]  He's a president's council donator to La Raza, who of course promotes the race over everything else.
[00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.973]  And Rodriguez is one of the new minority owners of a television network.
[00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:59.523]  His El Rey network is geared towards a Hispanic audience, and he admits that his network, he will use it if the president or the White House calls upon him to use the network to reach out to the Latino voters.
[00:04:00.043 --> 00:04:15.935]  But of course, if the way Machete promotes illegal immigration is any indicator of how Robert Rodriguez is going to try and reach the Latino voters, well, I guess we can expect to see more messages promoting racial division rather than bringing us all together.
[00:04:15.935 --> 00:04:16.836]  So, this...
[00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:34.771]  This is who Obama is spending his evening with tonight, rather than visiting the border, rather than addressing the crisis and actually acknowledging that this is a huge issue and maybe just showing the American people, hey, I'm not afraid to go and be in these border facilities where there's all these contagious diseases running rampant.
[00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:36.713]  I mean, even that, to just go and show that.
[00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:51.067]  He's gonna go up with people who are paying $35,000 to go party it up at Robert Rodriguez's house because he's showing you this is the kind of president he is and this is where he stands on this issue of illegal immigration.
[00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:55.030]  Alright folks, we'll be right back.
[00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.212]  That's from Infowars Nightly News.
[00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:58.153]  Last night, Lord Obama is still in town.
[00:04:58.153 --> 00:04:58.874]  We'll be covering it.
[00:04:58.874 --> 00:04:59.275]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.382]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:05:02.382 --> 00:05:09.806]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:20.634]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:29.880]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.682]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:05:34.682 --> 00:05:38.424]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:05:38.424 --> 00:05:40.485]  Experience the new formula.
[00:05:40.485 --> 00:05:43.066]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:44.407]  Shield your family.
[00:05:44.407 --> 00:05:46.228]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:05:58.536 --> 00:06:00.759]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:08.828]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:08.828 --> 00:06:15.937]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:20.961]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:31.590]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:38.075]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:02.558]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:07:02.558 --> 00:07:03.799]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:05.120]  God knows what's in there.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.363]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:15.127]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:16.347]  That one is better.
[00:07:16.347 --> 00:07:17.568]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:07:17.568 --> 00:07:19.008]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:19.648]  It's good water.
[00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:25.630]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:32.852]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:36.133]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:43.475]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:44.636]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:07:44.636 --> 00:07:45.856]  It's good water.
[00:07:45.856 --> 00:07:46.296]  Refreshing.
[00:07:46.296 --> 00:07:47.077]  It's good!

[00:08:16.224 --> 00:08:21.268]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:25.050]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:40.621]  Generals gathered in their masses Just like witches at black masses In the fields the bodies burning Evil minds that plot destruction Sorcerers of death's construction
[00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:58.671]  And over in the Middle East right now, the ISIS New World Order force is engaged in massive destruction of Christian churches, minority Muslim mosques, and engaged in mass exterminations.
[00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:00.492]  We're now several months into that.
[00:09:00.492 --> 00:09:07.055]  Three plus years into 300 plus thousand murdered at the hands of Al-Qaeda and ISIS forces in Syria.
[00:09:09.366 --> 00:09:15.590]  Defense Secretary Hagel has come out saying every country in the world is threatened by ISIS.
[00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.873]  Basically, give up all your rights or they'll kill you any minute.
[00:09:19.873 --> 00:09:25.257]  When he literally is overseeing the transference of weapons to them.
[00:09:25.257 --> 00:09:28.619]  And they are a Saudi Arabian army.
[00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:29.820]  Simply amazing.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.941]  And that's even in major defense publications.
[00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:36.304]  That's not even hidden or debated at an academic or military level.
[00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:47.204]  The general public, though, is being told we're going to take all your rights because of ISIS when it's publicly run by the criminals that sit upon our government.
[00:09:47.204 --> 00:09:55.271]  I'm going to get into Barack Obama and the fact that he's spending three days in Austin, three hellish days, I guess staying down at the W Hotel.
[00:09:56.448 --> 00:10:06.315]  With Secret Service crawling all over downtown, literally bugging their eyes out hatefully at men, women, and children to let you know you are scum, you are a slave.
[00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:09.138]  It's not about keeping the criminal puppet Obama safe.
[00:10:10.003 --> 00:10:13.284]  It's all about dominating America.
[00:10:13.284 --> 00:10:19.606]  Helicopters, checkpoints, I-35, the most busy highway in the country, the most busy stretch, is through Austin.
[00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:24.107]  That's on record, according to the National Transportation Bureau.
[00:10:24.107 --> 00:10:34.890]  And openly, ladies and gentlemen, I-35 shut down for hours, for hours, southbound today.
[00:10:36.368 --> 00:10:45.295]  And even after 45 minutes after Obama had left, I was watching the news, I said I'll drive into the office now, I was up to go down I-35 partway.
[00:10:45.295 --> 00:10:54.702]  I'm driving and he's been gone for 45 minutes to an hour and there's still the highway shut with more Austin police cars driving around.
[00:10:54.702 --> 00:10:58.365]  And the headline is from KVUE, Obama visit cost APD thousands.
[00:10:58.365 --> 00:10:59.626]  How about hundreds of thousands?
[00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:20.117]  I mean, I think I want to go find some Secret Service downtown and just go up to them and say, why are you in make-believe land bugging your eyes out at like families pushing baby strollers who don't even care that Obama's here?
[00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:28.162]  We're here working and living and then every time the emperor shows up, he could easily fly helicopters to nearby fields like he does in D.C.
[00:11:28.162 --> 00:11:30.484]  and places they won't put up with it.
[00:11:30.484 --> 00:11:33.766]  And then get in a limo and drive a mile to these fundraisers.
[00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:40.713]  With all these different Democratic Mafia bosses in Austin, who've already destroyed California and now moved here.
[00:11:40.713 --> 00:11:43.115]  Instead, they just want to shut everything down.
[00:11:43.115 --> 00:11:45.176]  It really makes me want to throw up.
[00:11:49.153 --> 00:11:58.759]  And I've talked to multiple people that have been downtown who are just blocks and blocks away from where Obama is at, with the Secret Service just rolling around bugging their eyes out of people.
[00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:07.003]  And I've had the Secret Service, and I've told this story many times, at Bilderberg 2008, no one knew where Hillary and Obama were in Virginia.
[00:12:07.003 --> 00:12:08.684]  They disappeared for over a day.
[00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:09.905]  We were there.
[00:12:09.905 --> 00:12:13.327]  The armored limousines came in with Hillary and Obama.
[00:12:13.327 --> 00:12:15.148]  It later came out they were there years later.
[00:12:15.148 --> 00:12:16.469]  And they would actually lift him.
[00:12:17.788 --> 00:12:26.550]  HK MP5s up and point them in our direction as we stood there with video cameras or with bullhorns.
[00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:32.891]  Like, ooh, I'm intimidating you because you're out here reporting, as if that scares me.
[00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:37.151]  If I want to go buy a dark suit and wear sunglasses, I can do it all day long.
[00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:43.312]  I'd watch Secret Service walk around with their little, you know, their little jackets talking into it like they're imagining they're in movies.
[00:12:43.312 --> 00:12:44.753]  I mean, what a joke!
[00:12:44.753 --> 00:12:46.173]  You're not Clint Eastwood, okay?
[00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:49.423]  And again, I shouldn't even attack the Secret Service.
[00:12:49.423 --> 00:12:55.749]  I know a lot of them, and I know some very close to the criminal operation, and they say it's worse than we know.
[00:12:55.749 --> 00:12:59.432]  Not just Bongino on the air who was a senior Secret Service, but a lot of them.
[00:12:59.432 --> 00:13:06.699]  But I think it's the mid and low-level ones that they have out far off that are just trying to play the part of a movie or something.
[00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:11.404]  And, you know, I don't like going to really bad third-world countries, because the police act a little like that.
[00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:18.947]  And I've been in England when the Prime Minister's right down the street and their people don't act like that.
[00:13:18.947 --> 00:13:23.109]  I've been there when royalty's running around and they don't act like that.
[00:13:23.109 --> 00:13:24.549]  I mean, this is the new royalty.
[00:13:24.549 --> 00:13:37.334]  And Edward Bernays, the big psych warfare chief, Sigmund Freud's nephew who worked for the Department of War, the Department of Defense, the greatest PR propaganda master probably of all time, except for Joseph Goebbels, maybe.
[00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.812]  Joseph Goebbels was so jealous of him it came out in the Nazi files.
[00:13:42.812 --> 00:13:47.855]  They had an international hit out of a million US dollars on Edward Bernays.
[00:13:47.855 --> 00:13:50.577]  That's how jealous they were of him.
[00:13:50.577 --> 00:13:54.539]  But he was just as bad in many respects as the Nazis.
[00:13:54.539 --> 00:14:00.463]  And of course he wrote three books bragging about how he mind-controlled the public for the globalists.
[00:14:00.463 --> 00:14:04.826]  And Bernays got into the fact in the 20s.
[00:14:06.536 --> 00:14:09.797]  He worked right up into the seventies when he was like ninety-something years old.
[00:14:09.797 --> 00:14:27.703]  That we've got to merge politics with Hollywood that was starting to burgeon at the time and just make it all about how they're the new royalty so it's not about their policies and so the public feel removed from the political elite and feel powerless.
[00:14:27.703 --> 00:14:34.226]  And that's what the helicopters and the checkpoints and the TSA and the red carpets and the Air Force One and the
[00:14:35.413 --> 00:14:43.899]  Hollywood dinners with Obama is all about is to make you think they're prestigious and, oh my gosh, like Hollywood people.
[00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:50.504]  And then the political class grovels to Hollywood stars, and the Hollywood stars then grovel to the political class.
[00:14:50.504 --> 00:14:52.245]  I've seen it.
[00:14:52.245 --> 00:14:54.947]  I've seen it myself.
[00:14:58.312 --> 00:15:01.035]  And it is so disgusting.
[00:15:01.035 --> 00:15:03.338]  In fact, I want to find a clip from myriad old movies.
[00:15:03.338 --> 00:15:15.772]  We've all seen old movies that have this, that are based on real things that happen where the natives are about to kill everybody, but the doctor throws some gunpowder in the fire and it explodes.
[00:15:15.772 --> 00:15:18.255]  And they've never seen that before, so they start bowing down.
[00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:26.277]  Or to use a Return of the Jedi cheesy analogy, the Ewoks start worshipping C-3PO, thinking he's a golden god.
[00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:32.623]  Or to use Indiana Jones, where there's a lot of Stark, they hold up the golden idol, and they all bow down to it.
[00:15:32.623 --> 00:15:40.111]  It's literally like natives that have never seen a firearm, and they're about to kill you, but you go, Ha-goo-ga-ba-tonga!
[00:15:40.111 --> 00:15:44.415]  And you pull the trigger on the gun, and fire it, and they all start groveling in fear.
[00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:59.588]  That's what all the big government buildings and the black uniforms and the checkpoints and the black masks and the armored vehicles are.
[00:15:59.588 --> 00:16:02.669]  So this is, this is what the system is.
[00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:08.531]  And that everybody else doesn't actually produce literature or art or science or trailblazing
[00:16:10.794 --> 00:16:13.779]  Everyone then becomes a wannabe establishment type.
[00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:16.544]  So you have all these subsections of fake country club people.
[00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:28.711]  And fake trendies with their mismatched socks and big beards lecturing you, you know, that it's bad to be a white male, even though they're white males, or, you know, the feminist movement.
[00:16:28.711 --> 00:16:40.221]  And then that's all it is, is these little empty, scared people who don't have success, who don't have an identity, other than what they've gone and basically picked off a store shelf that they've decided is their humanity.
[00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:41.903]  And they're the intellectuals.
[00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:44.085]  And no one else is an intellectual but them.
[00:16:45.805 --> 00:16:48.086]  And they're going to tell you not to use the word bossy.
[00:16:48.086 --> 00:16:51.987]  And they're going to tell you not to use the word illegal immigrant, and then immigrant.
[00:16:51.987 --> 00:16:54.967]  And they're going to tell you what you can and can't do.
[00:16:54.967 --> 00:17:03.610]  And they're going to control the language, and you're going to comply with them.
[00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:14.033]  And it is all just a giant, giant, off-the-chart joke on every single level, and it's a fraud.
[00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:14.773]  But imagine it.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:27.833]  7.30 this morning, I click on the local traffic news knowing there'd be traffic jams everywhere, and I-35 is shut down during drive time.
[00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:32.639]  And it already takes an hour to get anywhere in the city, because they didn't build roads like they should.
[00:17:32.639 --> 00:17:35.163]  They wanted to build light rail, and it's all, again, globalist control.
[00:17:36.926 --> 00:17:40.549]  And then I decided to drive in at like 10 to 15.
[00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:45.972]  I got ready at home because I had to go down an area of 35 that Obama had just gone on.
[00:17:45.972 --> 00:17:51.256]  And again, it was almost an hour after he'd gone by.
[00:17:51.256 --> 00:17:58.141]  And they had all of I-35 southbound.
[00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:03.885]  Did you just come on air, Buckley?
[00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.111]  Let's just shut everything down right now.
[00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:16.797]  I have a maximum rule, three years in, that when you guys come on there, unless you tell me a guess or something's ready, that I want you to say it on air.
[00:18:16.797 --> 00:18:19.418]  Listeners, just come on over to the mic.
[00:18:19.418 --> 00:18:21.860]  Because we're going to break this habit right now.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:22.420]  Go ahead.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.022]  A friend of mine has been stuck in traffic almost two hours.
[00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.950]  And he sent us a video.
[00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.691]  It's just a real simple, quick video.
[00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:43.153]  Well, I mean, this is an incredible scandal, because the photos you found, guys, and I shot some video on my phone this morning as well, are nothing compared to the overhead traffic cam shots they had of just 30 miles of I-35 stopped.
[00:18:43.153 --> 00:18:51.235]  And then long after he went, it's like a revelry for the police under orders to just squat on the highway.
[00:18:52.358 --> 00:19:03.485]  And just to keep it closed as an act of total domination, as you're going bankrupt paying for the gas prices that they've engineered.
[00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:07.488]  So, we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[00:19:07.488 --> 00:19:18.695]  Luckily, I have a new code on my phone, if you're having issues getting into it to get those videos.
[00:19:18.695 --> 00:19:20.576]  Did you guys hear what I said?
[00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:20.696]  Good.
[00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.330]  I'm going to reset.
[00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:30.053]  I'm going to come back after the break.
[00:19:30.053 --> 00:19:32.975]  And I'm going to get into all this.
[00:19:32.975 --> 00:19:36.436]  But again, it's on purpose, folks.
[00:19:36.436 --> 00:19:39.198]  Because Americans will put up with anything.
[00:19:39.198 --> 00:19:42.859]  I mean, they have bigger ceremonies for the President than they do for the North Korean dictator.
[00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:46.761]  This is so un-American, it's a joke.
[00:19:46.761 --> 00:19:49.423]  George Washington wouldn't even allow parades for himself.
[00:19:50.342 --> 00:19:52.483]  Because he was an American.
[00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:57.104]  Now look what they've done, and this guy is trying to destroy the country, and everyone's saluting him.
[00:19:57.104 --> 00:19:59.604]  They should be vomiting when they see him.

[00:21:27.337 --> 00:21:30.241]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[00:21:30.441 --> 00:21:42.130]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.

[00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:04.597]  Question, could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:22:04.597 --> 00:22:05.857]  Answer, yes!

[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.142]  Do you ever feel like you live in an alternate universe?
[00:23:31.142 --> 00:23:35.285]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying.
[00:23:35.285 --> 00:23:38.307]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[00:23:38.307 --> 00:23:39.928]  Chaos on our border.
[00:23:39.928 --> 00:23:42.450]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.392]  Life is getting ready to change.
[00:23:44.392 --> 00:23:47.414]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.
[00:23:47.414 --> 00:23:50.636]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[00:23:50.636 --> 00:23:50.816]  That's 888-507-8789.
[00:24:09.103 --> 00:24:16.191]  We filed a petition yesterday, expanding on the one that our reporter Joe Biggs put up a few days ago.
[00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:19.455]  And last time I checked it, it had one signature.
[00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:34.238]  The article had almost a thousand comments but one signature on the article saying that we want the illegals, the children, to be bused to the White House and to D.C.
[00:24:34.238 --> 00:24:38.821]  to be put in the Democratic Party areas and to let the Democratic Party fundraisers
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.762]  All the big rich billionaires who are tax-exempt under Obama, the ones that got all the Obamacare waivers, that they should house them.
[00:24:47.762 --> 00:25:00.365]  But even better, how about we go dump all the MS-13 kids and the rest of them, that's now being confirmed, off at the W downtown where the Lord and Savior is staying.
[00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:03.766]  And by the way, Austin Media is basically covering up
[00:25:05.084 --> 00:25:08.425]  The fact that Obama is shut down I-35 for hours.
[00:25:08.425 --> 00:25:16.546]  They're admitting there was some, quote, traffic problems, but they're not even admitting that there's still traffic jams ongoing while this happens.
[00:25:16.546 --> 00:25:19.907]  Let's go back to the White House petition.
[00:25:19.907 --> 00:25:26.208]  There on screen, there it is, that Kurt Nemo and I put up.
[00:25:26.208 --> 00:25:32.969]  And you can go to Infowars.com and find the article that's now scrolled off into the News Archive.
[00:25:33.689 --> 00:25:35.910]  That's the Top Stories archive.
[00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:42.831]  The featured news, Top Stories that roll off, will be in the Top Stories link at the topofinfowars.com.
[00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:48.273]  And if you want to believe it, it only has 369 signatures now.
[00:25:48.273 --> 00:25:49.953]  This morning it hadn't updated.
[00:25:49.953 --> 00:25:58.415]  In the past it would update in real time, and we famously have had petitions that got half a million people signing them.
[00:25:58.415 --> 00:25:59.075]  Now we get 369.
[00:25:59.075 --> 00:25:59.895]  Do you think they're gaming it?
[00:26:03.868 --> 00:26:06.893]  Do bears go potty in the woods?
[00:26:06.893 --> 00:26:08.235]  Do fish swim in the sea?
[00:26:08.235 --> 00:26:11.520]  Do ducks quack?
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.742]  Does Obama lie?
[00:26:14.818 --> 00:26:17.219]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[00:26:17.219 --> 00:26:40.393]  Now listen, I haven't even gotten into the big stack of border news that is exploding and our reporters that are still on the ground in Southern California where the feds are swearing with the sheriff to arrest anybody that dares try to block the precious buses where Homeland Security is human smuggling, violating federal law in front of everyone to dump illegals at military bases across the country
[00:26:41.173 --> 00:26:58.108]  And at churches across the country, to then be housed in public schools, and then to be legalized, and then to be given voter ID cards, and then to vote like New York State to ban guns, and we now have gun confiscation beginning in New York.
[00:26:58.108 --> 00:26:58.929]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:26:58.929 --> 00:27:00.851]  It's a mafia takeover.
[00:27:00.851 --> 00:27:05.275]  And Robert Rodriguez has his El Rey Hispanic Ku Klux Klan channel.
[00:27:06.537 --> 00:27:10.620]  And he's a big part of Mecha and La Raza, for those inside the race, everything.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.121]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:13.982]  And it's openly funded by Obama.
[00:27:13.982 --> 00:27:18.646]  I knew about this when it was secret, but decided not to even go there, because it would reveal sources.
[00:27:18.646 --> 00:27:28.733]  But he's now giving interviews to Variety, you name it, saying, I will use my Spanish-speaking network to influence politics in America and open the border.
[00:27:28.733 --> 00:27:31.495]  To unlimited South American, you name it, immigration.
[00:27:33.288 --> 00:27:43.535]  And again, this is a reverse colonization, but we're being colonized by failed third world countries, with the globalists working with them in tandem.
[00:27:43.535 --> 00:27:54.642]  And again, don't use the word bossy, don't call them aliens, don't call them illegal, because Michelle Obama said so, and my God, it would be so scary to tell her to go to hell.
[00:27:55.558 --> 00:27:58.021]  It would be so scary to say no to these known criminals.
[00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:01.625]  We've just got to do what they say, because they shut down roads when they come to town.
[00:28:01.625 --> 00:28:03.187]  They have red carpets.
[00:28:03.187 --> 00:28:07.572]  The Marines salute them.
[00:28:07.572 --> 00:28:09.454]  They are God.
[00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:13.659]  And so they will take your house if you don't pay the fake income tax, and they will give it to an illegal.
[00:28:15.728 --> 00:28:17.970]  Who will just be exploited down the road.
[00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.571]  So here's the headlines.
[00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:21.312]  Gun confiscation begins in New York.
[00:28:21.312 --> 00:28:25.736]  Nassau County man, state police just came to my home and took everything.
[00:28:25.736 --> 00:28:30.640]  As the governor promised, the SWAT team raids are beginning.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.664]  Defense Secretary Hagel says ISIS is an imminent threat to every stabilized country on the earth.
[00:28:35.664 --> 00:28:39.487]  I agree with that statement and the globalists that run it are the real imminent threat.
[00:28:40.967 --> 00:28:43.530]  The globalists that run it.
[00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.112]  The destabilization program.
[00:28:45.112 --> 00:28:47.795]  Just like the open borders here.
[00:28:47.795 --> 00:28:48.957]  High-level NSA official.
[00:28:48.957 --> 00:28:53.242]  The NSA has become J. Edgar Hoover on super steroids, spying on everything.
[00:28:53.242 --> 00:28:54.203]  Folks, it's well known.
[00:28:54.203 --> 00:28:56.046]  Everything's listened to in live time.
[00:28:56.046 --> 00:28:56.887]  Everything's tracked.
[00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:07.493]  The local police all want to be federalized, because then they get led into the star chamber computer rooms, where they can just spy on everybody, keep files on their ex-wife, their husband.
[00:29:07.493 --> 00:29:10.113]  It's just total beyond 1984.
[00:29:10.113 --> 00:29:12.094]  Maximum criminal operation.
[00:29:12.094 --> 00:29:14.654]  Money laundering, child kidnap running.
[00:29:14.654 --> 00:29:18.595]  I mean, the government is 100% pure Satan.
[00:29:18.595 --> 00:29:21.616]  Now, the average person, mid-level, doesn't even know that.
[00:29:21.616 --> 00:29:24.417]  And the government has a lot of real functions, but at the top,
[00:29:25.416 --> 00:29:28.178]  I mean, it might as well be Elzebub captaining it.
[00:29:28.178 --> 00:29:29.459]  Let's continue.
[00:29:29.459 --> 00:29:30.600]  Shock report!
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.302]  70 million people would be starving in the streets without government welfare programs.
[00:29:34.302 --> 00:29:35.283]  That's coming up.
[00:29:35.283 --> 00:29:38.145]  Washington's arrogance will destroy its empire.
[00:29:38.145 --> 00:29:39.166]  That's part of the plan.
[00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:41.167]  They want the mega-empire to rise.
[00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:42.328]  Chinese purchases of U.S.
[00:29:42.328 --> 00:29:46.591]  real estate up 72% as the Bank of China facilitates money laundering.
[00:29:46.591 --> 00:29:48.312]  They're learning from the New World Order.
[00:29:48.312 --> 00:29:48.752]  We'll be back.
[00:29:48.752 --> 00:29:49.213]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.213 --> 00:29:50.233]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.233 --> 00:29:51.735]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.746 --> 00:29:55.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.744 --> 00:30:04.725]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:30:04.725 --> 00:30:08.066]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:30:08.066 --> 00:30:10.167]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:30:10.167 --> 00:30:12.328]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:30:12.328 --> 00:30:13.968]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:30:13.968 --> 00:30:17.309]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:18.889]  If so, consider this.
[00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:27.812]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:30:28.172 --> 00:30:34.560]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.602]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:36.602 --> 00:30:44.251]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:30:53.344 --> 00:30:54.025]  Live Life Healthy!
[00:30:59.955 --> 00:31:06.117]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:31:06.117 --> 00:31:10.679]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:31:10.679 --> 00:31:15.241]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:31:15.661 --> 00:31:18.582]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:31:18.582 --> 00:31:24.025]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:31:24.025 --> 00:31:31.408]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:31:31.408 --> 00:31:35.549]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:40.652]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:40.652 --> 00:31:41.512]  This is innovating.
[00:31:41.792 --> 00:31:49.281]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:31:49.281 --> 00:31:53.545]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:32:00.179 --> 00:32:02.481]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:32:02.481 --> 00:32:09.905]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:32:09.905 --> 00:32:20.713]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:32:20.713 --> 00:32:29.979]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:32:30.699 --> 00:32:34.781]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:38.522]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:32:38.522 --> 00:32:40.582]  Experience the new formula.
[00:32:40.582 --> 00:32:43.163]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:32:43.163 --> 00:32:44.484]  Shield your family.
[00:32:44.484 --> 00:32:46.304]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:33:09.272 --> 00:33:14.173]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:14.173 --> 00:33:21.934]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.934 --> 00:33:32.816]  The late, former head of the Star Wars program, nuclear physicist and engineer, Dr. Bob Bowman, was the secret head of the Star Wars program that was later declassified.
[00:33:32.816 --> 00:33:37.977]  He said by 1979, when the Star Wars program was already old, under another name,
[00:33:38.985 --> 00:33:41.267]  The public was told about it in the 80s.
[00:33:41.267 --> 00:33:54.217]  There was a fleet of over a hundred space planes with DU-SABO decapitation weapons to take out governments, even under mountains.
[00:33:54.217 --> 00:33:57.759]  And that he could only talk about that because it had been accidentally declassified.
[00:33:57.759 --> 00:34:01.302]  Well, here it is in The Week newspaper.
[00:34:01.302 --> 00:34:06.226]  The Pentagon's plan to put robot marines in space.
[00:34:10.442 --> 00:34:15.744]  And it breaks it down how they're launching robot drones in space.
[00:34:15.744 --> 00:34:21.486]  Yeah, they're launching them in 2014.
[00:34:21.486 --> 00:34:30.429]  I mean, basically 35 years ago, 36 years ago, there was already a fleet of these in orbit.
[00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:37.071]  And you can bet whatever the public's going to be shown is going to be the super old models.
[00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:38.272]  Like the ones we have on screen.
[00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:45.475]  That is a 1970s model on screen.
[00:34:45.475 --> 00:34:47.957]  And they're telling you about it in 2014.
[00:34:47.957 --> 00:34:50.840]  Oh my gosh, what an incredible declassification!
[00:34:52.694 --> 00:35:05.707]  That's how I told you how the NSA controlled everything with their hubs and all the telecommunications buildings, how they used keywords, and how they were building the systems and the compression to save everything in real time.
[00:35:05.707 --> 00:35:07.369]  I told you that in 1997.
[00:35:07.369 --> 00:35:09.371]  And again, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.371 --> 00:35:13.054]  It's that you better listen to me now.
[00:35:15.177 --> 00:35:17.798]  About what won't come out for 5-10 years.
[00:35:17.798 --> 00:35:21.498]  Because they're not waiting 40 years, 35 years to bring stuff out now.
[00:35:21.498 --> 00:35:24.239]  They're bringing it out every 5-10.
[00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:27.880]  And let me give you the newsflash.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:36.362]  Remember while we're talking about open borders and all the corruption, the government funding ISIS and they don't care that you know?
[00:35:36.362 --> 00:35:38.122]  It's because they think you're done.
[00:35:38.122 --> 00:35:42.103]  They've already put stuff in the food and water supply that's way beyond even what I know.
[00:35:43.288 --> 00:35:47.790]  They've already jacked with basically the atmosphere, you name it.
[00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.511]  We're not in 2014, boys and girls.
[00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:59.534]  And that's why they treat you like you're wild dogs or something.
[00:35:59.534 --> 00:36:09.397]  They don't even treat us like we're natives that they, you know, they're at the fort and they fire the shotgun to scare the natives off.
[00:36:09.397 --> 00:36:11.218]  Or, you know, have a fancy Trojan horse
[00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:18.439]  They treat us like wild dogs or like lice or something.
[00:36:18.439 --> 00:36:22.467]  They're just brushing off of us.
[00:36:22.467 --> 00:36:23.349]  And that's the attitude.
[00:36:24.921 --> 00:36:41.612]  And so they can engage in all their little weird fantasies of engaging in dehumanization, in mad scientist behavior on us, social engineering, to the point of saying you will not use the word bossy, and you will say 2 plus 2 equals whatever we say.
[00:36:41.612 --> 00:36:42.392]  Is that clear?
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:44.674]  And we go, yes, I don't want to be racist.
[00:36:44.674 --> 00:36:51.858]  There's a video that I'm going to play here in a few minutes before I get into all this news that's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:36:54.246 --> 00:36:57.488]  That is incredibly shocking.
[00:36:57.488 --> 00:37:03.651]  Video crazed abortion advocate attacks peaceful pro-lifers.
[00:37:03.651 --> 00:37:08.914]  And we have the unedited video with the goblin troll.
[00:37:08.914 --> 00:37:15.778]  In fact, I told Watson to go with the headline this morning of goblin trolls attack pro-lifers, but he didn't think that was professional.
[00:37:15.778 --> 00:37:19.780]  But I mean, when the shoe fits, actual goblin troll.
[00:37:22.911 --> 00:37:25.734]  Literally doesn't need makeup to be in the next Lord of the Rings.
[00:37:25.734 --> 00:37:27.996]  Cave troll.
[00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:37.024]  Runs up and begins screaming at pro-lifers who are at a big city abortion clinic that on record mainly kills minority babies.
[00:37:37.024 --> 00:37:44.671]  And begins screaming racist and begins attacking the pro-lifers and rips their sign down and stomps on it.
[00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:51.725]  Because when they invoke the word race, it doesn't matter they can't tie their shoelaces.
[00:37:51.725 --> 00:38:03.295]  It doesn't matter that this troll-like white woman... And I shouldn't even make fun of how she looks, but it just totally fits the bill.
[00:38:03.295 --> 00:38:11.401]  This intellectually ugly person begins screaming, you anti-woman, anti-minority, you racist, and begins attacking him, hitting him.
[00:38:14.406 --> 00:38:18.029]  And then invokes racists and then attacks racists!
[00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:31.642]  So, you know, as Obama turns ISIS loose to murder Christians and Muslims all over the Middle East, blow up mosque churches, 300,000 dead in Syria, you know, as they break down the borders, as hundreds of thousands get killed in Mexico,
[00:38:32.423 --> 00:38:34.124]  By the cartels, no one cares.
[00:38:34.124 --> 00:38:45.608]  You just showed Don Johnson shooting a pregnant woman in a fictitious movie made by a literal Hispanic grand dragon of the Hispanic race nation that they're trying to make Hispanics join.
[00:38:45.608 --> 00:38:52.011]  Instead of having basic liberty and freedom and joining the Liberty Nation, which I'm trying to get everybody to join.
[00:38:52.011 --> 00:38:55.792]  They're at an abortion clinic where 80% of the abortions are minority babies.
[00:38:55.792 --> 00:38:56.773]  That's CNS News.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:07.183]  And so if you don't want black and Hispanic babies literally chopped up and you're white, you're a racist.
[00:39:07.183 --> 00:39:24.150]  And how many abortion clinic places, videos have you seen where you'll be white people trying to get them to not kill the black babies and they'll have a black person or an Asian doctor run out and say, no one wants the ugly, dumb black babies.
[00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:25.311]  We've played those clips many times.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.962]  We've got a guest coming on about this later, so we'll play it then.
[00:39:28.962 --> 00:39:40.629]  No one wants, and I've used to hear that myself, I have gone and protested and also covered protests where they were arresting pro-life protesters who weren't even on the abortion clinic property in Austin before, years ago, back in 96, 97.
[00:39:43.274 --> 00:39:47.279]  And they would run up and push on me and say, nobody wants the black babies.
[00:39:47.279 --> 00:39:49.782]  And it'd be like black people or white people doing it.
[00:39:49.782 --> 00:39:54.788]  So I always say that to black preachers I have on about it, like Reverend Childress and others, a black genocide report.
[00:39:54.788 --> 00:39:56.210]  And they go, of course that's what they say.
[00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.793]  No, that's what they say.
[00:39:58.793 --> 00:40:02.618]  So again, if you don't want to take a black baby, and I mean, chop it up.
[00:40:05.976 --> 00:40:07.578]  You are a racist.
[00:40:07.578 --> 00:40:09.459]  Yeah, there's the video headline.
[00:40:09.459 --> 00:40:12.982]  Abortionist challenges protesters to adopt ugly black babies.
[00:40:12.982 --> 00:40:17.126]  Not a word from the Democratic Party, who founded the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:40:17.126 --> 00:40:24.233]  Because they've got literal morons with extremely IQs, extremely low IQs.
[00:40:25.716 --> 00:40:28.038]  Then I shouldn't even attack or be mean to them.
[00:40:28.038 --> 00:40:29.839]  We should feel sorry for them.
[00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:32.481]  Racist!
[00:40:32.481 --> 00:40:34.163]  I'm an intellectual!
[00:40:34.163 --> 00:40:37.405]  I'm trendy!
[00:40:37.405 --> 00:40:39.687]  Just attacking people's free speech.
[00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:41.588]  You don't want blacks to die!
[00:40:41.588 --> 00:40:45.171]  You hate blacks!
[00:40:45.171 --> 00:40:49.775]  You don't want Mexican drug cartels to kill 130,000 Mexicans!
[00:40:49.775 --> 00:40:51.356]  You're racist against Mexicans!
[00:40:53.885 --> 00:40:57.768]  I mean, literally, that's all they've got is that they're Democrats.
[00:40:57.768 --> 00:41:03.231]  And Republicans have got their problems, and identify with parties well, and defend Republicans when they're doing bad stuff.
[00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:04.072]  It's disgusting.
[00:41:04.072 --> 00:41:16.701]  But I've never seen anything like this dumbed-down television culture of nobodies, who have no jobs, no future, Obamacare written by hardcore globalists to bankrupt them.
[00:41:16.701 --> 00:41:17.161]  On record.
[00:41:18.942 --> 00:41:20.023]  And they don't care.
[00:41:20.023 --> 00:41:36.876]  They're just dangerous masses of snot-nosed trolls who, ladies and gentlemen, you can bet money if they start putting patriots in FEMA camps and they just give people a pretext like some federal buildings being blown up and they say it's time to arrest these people, that's already being said.
[00:41:36.876 --> 00:41:40.279]  Arrest the climate deniers, arrest Alex Jones, blah blah blah.
[00:41:40.279 --> 00:41:43.802]  They will cheer, ladies and gentlemen, public executions.
[00:41:43.802 --> 00:41:45.303]  That is my belief, that is my opinion.
[00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:51.324]  And we have the Weatherman reports, the people that trained Obama, from Larry Grafwald and others.
[00:41:51.324 --> 00:41:56.688]  It was confirmed in court where they plan to put 50 million conservatives in forced labor camps.
[00:41:56.688 --> 00:41:58.829]  They dream 300 and 400 pounders.
[00:42:00.816 --> 00:42:06.161]  You know, 6X underwear wearing commandos to literally strut around in black uniforms at the FEMA camps.
[00:42:06.161 --> 00:42:26.198]  They'll have real police and real, you know, quote, warriors, veterans in armored vehicles out rounding us up, having combat with the patriots, dragging us back to pit dungeons where there'll be nothing but Janet Reno's and Rachel Maddow's and this troll woman in Ohio, Columbus, Ohio, will literally be in commando outfits ruling
[00:42:27.196 --> 00:42:28.477]  And you're like, why would you want to do that?
[00:42:28.477 --> 00:42:29.438]  Well, you're not like them.
[00:42:29.438 --> 00:42:30.579]  You don't understand.
[00:42:30.579 --> 00:42:37.064]  They relish attacking, like, self-propelled slugs.
[00:42:37.064 --> 00:42:38.605]  Anyone that doesn't submit to them.
[00:42:38.605 --> 00:42:43.169]  It's all about, I am in charge!
[00:42:43.169 --> 00:42:46.011]  And they have an inhuman, demonic, goblin strength.
[00:42:48.035 --> 00:42:52.897]  Politically, to just force their will on everyone, and we bow, we say, yes, I will not say bossy.
[00:42:52.897 --> 00:42:54.318]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:42:54.318 --> 00:42:56.178]  Yes, I didn't build my business.
[00:42:56.178 --> 00:42:59.240]  Yes, I'll give my rights up even though you publicly run Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:06.523]  Yes, yes, you can sign all the signing statements, arrest reporters everywhere, even though top journalism groups say Obama is basically banning the First Amendment.
[00:43:06.783 --> 00:43:07.804]  That is liberal.
[00:43:07.804 --> 00:43:08.804]  That is trendy.
[00:43:08.804 --> 00:43:09.885]  That is acceptable.
[00:43:09.885 --> 00:43:11.065]  I worship you.
[00:43:11.065 --> 00:43:12.306]  It is so good.
[00:43:12.306 --> 00:43:14.527]  Please ship all the jobs overseas.
[00:43:14.527 --> 00:43:17.388]  Please flood every city with tens of thousands of illegals.
[00:43:17.388 --> 00:43:21.690]  Please put them on welfare to openly vote to bankrupt everything and take my guns.
[00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:22.631]  Thank you so much.
[00:43:22.631 --> 00:43:24.132]  You are wonderful.
[00:43:24.132 --> 00:43:29.554]  You buy all the propaganda and get Obama's emails every day and actually believe you're on the front lines.
[00:43:29.554 --> 00:43:32.396]  As long as you can pronounce the word racist, you are God.
[00:43:34.636 --> 00:43:35.816]  That's all they need.
[00:43:35.816 --> 00:43:38.797]  They don't need to know who circumnavigated the globe, Magellan.
[00:43:38.797 --> 00:43:42.879]  They don't need to know, you know, who proved that the Earth was round.
[00:43:42.879 --> 00:43:45.200]  They don't need to know what Newtonian physics is.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:58.344]  They don't need to know how many states there are, or the three branches of government, or how insurance corporations operate, or what Lloyd's of London is, or the history of shipping, or the history of language, or the history of Egypt, or the history of anything.
[00:43:58.344 --> 00:44:03.166]  They know how to say three words, homophobe, racist,
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.581]  Sexists!
[00:44:05.581 --> 00:44:07.482]  And that's what they've got!
[00:44:07.482 --> 00:44:17.588]  As they gobble GMO all day, and support GMO, and support fluoride in the water, they'll go into a restaurant and say, was this fish treated nicely?
[00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:19.249]  Did it have a name?
[00:44:19.249 --> 00:44:20.790]  Was it properly worshipped?
[00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:25.514]  And they all guilt each other at the table, and then guilt you as all part of their cult!
[00:44:26.394 --> 00:44:33.719]  Your submission, your hospitality to pat them on the head is fuel to their satanic weakness.
[00:44:33.719 --> 00:44:42.926]  These are weak scum who couldn't get a job, couldn't live, couldn't work, and they don't like you and your good-looking family.
[00:44:42.926 --> 00:44:44.627]  They don't like your nice car.
[00:44:44.627 --> 00:44:46.348]  They don't like your nice house.
[00:44:46.348 --> 00:44:50.311]  They're going to take it!
[00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:51.992]  And they're not gonna stop.
[00:44:51.992 --> 00:44:52.793]  They're coming.
[00:44:53.669 --> 00:44:58.092]  And the globalists aren't going to stage atrocities and blame it on us.
[00:44:58.092 --> 00:44:59.252]  They've done it before.
[00:44:59.252 --> 00:45:09.819]  They say it's about to happen again, and you can bet your bottom dollar they're going to teach you to love those red carpets in Air Force One and men in black uniforms bugging out their eyes at you and your family like North Korea.
[00:45:09.819 --> 00:45:12.800]  You're going to learn to worship Kim Jong-un.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.342]  You're going to learn to worship Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:45:17.011 --> 00:45:23.717]  Wanna thank our Heavenly Father, our Lord and Savior, Barack Obama!
[00:45:23.717 --> 00:45:29.042]  And he goes, Barack Obama!
[00:45:29.042 --> 00:45:30.203]  Soul Train, baby!
[00:45:32.756 --> 00:45:43.420]  You come up to Jamie Foxx, just on a mindless, primitive, racist power trip, and you say, hey Jamie Foxx, you know you're part of social engineering, why don't you speak out against black babies being killed?
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.021]  Shut up, crack of head!
[00:45:45.021 --> 00:45:47.362]  You just mad we're taking over!
[00:45:47.362 --> 00:45:49.642]  And our lord and savior, Barack Obama!
[00:45:49.642 --> 00:45:55.365]  Barack Obama!
[00:45:55.365 --> 00:45:58.546]  Y'all stand up right now, you gotta...
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.605]  But first, he says in the clip, we just need to thank our Heavenly Father.
[00:46:03.605 --> 00:46:05.767]  We need to thank our Creator, if my memory serves.
[00:46:05.767 --> 00:46:08.770]  And then he goes, our Lord and Savior, Barack Obama.
[00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:10.673]  It's even worse than that.
[00:46:10.673 --> 00:46:15.218]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:46:15.218 --> 00:46:16.179]  Obama is God!
[00:46:19.574 --> 00:46:23.296]  Secret Service are going to bug their eyes out at families of little kids walking down the street.
[00:46:23.296 --> 00:46:25.858]  First of all, giving honor to God.
[00:46:25.858 --> 00:46:27.059]  There it is.
[00:46:27.059 --> 00:46:29.960]  And our Lord and Savior, Barack Obama.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.163]  Barack Obama!
[00:46:34.163 --> 00:46:37.425]  Barack Obama!
[00:46:37.425 --> 00:46:40.527]  And they just look at you all as idiots, because you are.
[00:46:40.527 --> 00:46:42.348]  People that, I mean, this guy is a front man.
[00:46:43.789 --> 00:46:49.832]  The branding for the total takeover for 21 new taxes, seven of them, on people at the poverty line or below.
[00:46:49.832 --> 00:46:52.653]  I mean, it's bankrupting the whole country right now.
[00:46:52.653 --> 00:46:57.396]  And if that won't do it, we'll chip in a couple more million every few months for little kids.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.561]  And then they'll tell you, you're not going to call these foreigners or illegals.
[00:47:02.561 --> 00:47:04.762]  You're going to call them whatever we say.
[00:47:04.762 --> 00:47:06.002]  That's going to change every day.
[00:47:06.002 --> 00:47:08.503]  And remember, remember what Karl Rove said.
[00:47:08.503 --> 00:47:10.484]  He said, we are history's actors now.
[00:47:10.484 --> 00:47:11.805]  We control reality.
[00:47:11.805 --> 00:47:13.945]  We will give you a new reality every day.
[00:47:13.945 --> 00:47:17.287]  And then you will forget the old reality and accept the new reality.
[00:47:17.287 --> 00:47:24.569]  He's literally saying what O'Brien is saying to Winston while he's torturing him in 1984.
[00:47:24.569 --> 00:47:26.310]  Because that was based on real Soviet torture.
[00:47:28.917 --> 00:47:38.902]  And the only reason you heard about that in the New York Times was because Karl Rove was so arrogant, and the reporters were arrogant, and didn't like him at a cocktail party at the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[00:47:38.902 --> 00:47:41.564]  There's a bunch of them there going, you people are nothing.
[00:47:41.564 --> 00:47:43.785]  You'll report whatever I say you will.
[00:47:43.785 --> 00:47:46.526]  If I say the sun is purple, you'll do it.
[00:47:46.526 --> 00:47:49.748]  If I say water is red, you'll do it.
[00:47:49.748 --> 00:47:50.268]  And you know what?
[00:47:50.268 --> 00:47:51.309]  They do do it.
[00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:53.870]  Now they're just getting rid of the press corps entirely.
[00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.691]  They're just going to have press releases put out.
[00:47:55.691 --> 00:47:57.132]  And you're going to accept that too.
[00:47:58.396 --> 00:48:01.919]  And most of you fake reporters that sold out, you'll never even admit you're a loser.
[00:48:01.919 --> 00:48:03.040]  You'll never even turn around.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:08.805]  You'll keep groveling to the establishment as the whole thing goes under because you come from trash.
[00:48:08.805 --> 00:48:10.566]  Your families were failures.
[00:48:10.566 --> 00:48:11.547]  I've learned this.
[00:48:11.547 --> 00:48:18.473]  Most of these people that serve evil, their whole family line is failures and criminals and scammers and frauds.
[00:48:18.473 --> 00:48:20.334]  You're just being yourself, aren't you?
[00:48:20.334 --> 00:48:21.876]  Sacks of steaming crap.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:27.198]  And now they've officially repealed the law against propaganda domestically.
[00:48:27.198 --> 00:48:32.042]  So the Pentagon's involved PSYOPing every major city and the CIA.
[00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:38.107]  Oh, and you hear guys bragging on the street, yeah, I'm part of PSYOP in Austin now.
[00:48:38.107 --> 00:48:40.729]  I'll be in restaurants and bars, there's so many of them.
[00:48:40.729 --> 00:48:43.292]  And you just, everybody's just, that's just, they're just everywhere.
[00:48:43.292 --> 00:48:45.133]  You're nobodies!
[00:48:45.133 --> 00:48:46.895]  You're Benedict Arnolds, you're jokes!
[00:48:48.561 --> 00:48:52.045]  The pro-choice crowd were looking for a poster child.
[00:48:52.045 --> 00:48:54.387]  A woman in this clip certainly isn't it.
[00:48:54.387 --> 00:49:07.401]  A video shows a crazed abortion advocate physically and verbally attacking peaceful pro-lifers in downtown Columbus, Ohio, screaming racist, racist, racist, because they didn't want black babies being chopped up like Benny Hanna.
[00:49:07.401 --> 00:49:08.102]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:49:11.378 --> 00:49:13.739]  That is not what a fetus looks like, okay?
[00:49:13.739 --> 00:49:15.860]  It's a clump of cells at 12 weeks.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.180]  It does not look like that!
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:19.681]  It's a clump of motherf*****g cells!
[00:49:19.681 --> 00:49:22.102]  No hands are shown through that time!
[00:49:22.102 --> 00:49:26.783]  So what the f**k happened to this racist f*****g male that doesn't stand for women's rights?
[00:49:26.783 --> 00:49:32.685]  Get that camera out of my face!
[00:49:32.685 --> 00:49:34.345]  I'm gonna call the police.
[00:49:34.345 --> 00:49:36.386]  The camera wasn't in her face, she attacked them.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.102]  She's going back to troll hole.
[00:49:42.102 --> 00:49:42.762]  Riley!
[00:49:42.762 --> 00:49:43.823]  Riley!
[00:49:43.823 --> 00:49:44.564]  Riley!
[00:49:44.564 --> 00:49:48.426]  She's attacking their other sign.
[00:49:48.426 --> 00:49:50.107]  That'll be a dungeon keeper, probably.
[00:49:50.107 --> 00:49:53.349]  You are a white male privileged asshole!
[00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:55.070]  I'm calling the police right now.
[00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.752]  What you are is a racist mother f***er as well!
[00:49:57.752 --> 00:49:58.772]  How dare you f***ing do this to me!
[00:49:58.772 --> 00:50:01.074]  Think of these armies of people, think they're gonna beat us.
[00:50:01.997 --> 00:50:05.282]  That's why they put the soft kill in the water in return for this woman.
[00:50:05.282 --> 00:50:06.243]  Go ahead!
[00:50:06.243 --> 00:50:11.030]  Go right the f**k on ahead, you f**king sexist, misogynistic motherf**kers!
[00:50:12.256 --> 00:50:13.397]  That is all you are!
[00:50:13.397 --> 00:50:14.639]  You don't give a s**t about women!
[00:50:14.639 --> 00:50:16.541]  You don't give a s**t about life!
[00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:19.645]  All you are, are just a bunch of a**holes!
[00:50:33.513 --> 00:50:37.717]  It's not the technocrats jacking the food supply and altering all species across the board.
[00:50:37.717 --> 00:50:38.618]  No, no, no.
[00:50:38.618 --> 00:50:41.981]  It's pro-lifers that go out and try to stop babies from being killed.
[00:50:41.981 --> 00:50:44.323]  They're racist.
[00:50:44.323 --> 00:50:58.136]  And you saw her arrogant power trip as she panics, running around punching and hitting and smashing and breathing like a wild bull that's had a lobotomy, foaming at the mouth, pawing the ground.
[00:50:59.952 --> 00:51:04.293]  Are you happy doing your laundry with perfume detergents that irritate your skin?

[00:51:58.891 --> 00:52:01.734]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:06.858]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.858 --> 00:52:14.985]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:14.985 --> 00:52:19.510]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:23.313]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:29.420]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.583]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[00:54:47.823 --> 00:54:50.726]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:54:50.726 --> 00:54:56.052]  You notice, most nights now, I am on the Nightly News with the other great reporters and anchors.
[00:54:56.052 --> 00:55:04.242]  And we're gonna try to make that a five-night-a-week event where good old Alejandro Jones is on the Nightly News, if not hosting it.
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.304]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to open the phones up.
[00:55:10.304 --> 00:55:19.814]  In the next hour, for about 20-30 minutes, we're scheduled to have Dr. Alveda King on about her new book.
[00:55:19.814 --> 00:55:25.019]  Priestsforlife.org is the website, and the new book is King's Rules.
[00:55:26.144 --> 00:55:30.207]  She, of course, is the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King.
[00:55:30.207 --> 00:55:31.207]  So that's coming up.
[00:55:31.207 --> 00:55:33.509]  We'll open the phones up after that.
[00:55:33.509 --> 00:55:39.953]  And we're going to get Joe Biggs reporting from Southern California on the situation there.
[00:55:39.953 --> 00:55:41.734]  We'll be popping in as well.
[00:55:41.734 --> 00:55:54.583]  And then Abby Johnson from ATTWN.org will be coming on to talk about the bounties they have on minority children at Planned Parenthood and how they have people that give money directly to have them exterminated.
[00:55:55.916 --> 00:56:00.098]  We're going to engage in some serious racism here trying to save the majority babies.
[00:56:00.098 --> 00:56:01.719]  They're not really minorities anymore.
[00:56:01.719 --> 00:56:03.099]  We just try to save all the babies.
[00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:05.180]  We don't really think about what color they are.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:15.585]  But they've dumbed down the masses so much under political correctness that... Remember the poor woman that got shot to death because they had an army checkpoint going and a martial law drill in D.C.
[00:56:15.585 --> 00:56:17.405]  and they told her stop, men in uniforms?
[00:56:17.405 --> 00:56:20.767]  She got scared and ran away from them.
[00:56:23.143 --> 00:56:26.244]  And then she was driving in circles, so they shot her.
[00:56:26.244 --> 00:56:33.207]  And then the Senators all came out and said what heroes the Capitol Police were and all the rest of it.
[00:56:33.207 --> 00:56:38.288]  By giving Purple Hearts to the drone pilots sitting in air-conditioned trailers.
[00:56:38.288 --> 00:56:44.891]  And I just said this is terrible that they've killed this woman.
[00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:47.432]  And that was during the whole Trayvon Martin things.
[00:56:47.432 --> 00:56:48.892]  They were saying, how dare you?
[00:56:48.892 --> 00:56:50.533]  I bet it's a white woman, that's why you care.
[00:56:52.099 --> 00:56:57.803]  And then they noticed that I was reporting, as it came out, she was black, the same thing, and they're like, oh, you're not as bad now, Alex.
[00:56:57.803 --> 00:56:59.764]  You care that a black woman was killed.
[00:56:59.764 --> 00:57:02.926]  I didn't think, what color is that woman?
[00:57:02.926 --> 00:57:04.987]  Good looking lady, too.
[00:57:04.987 --> 00:57:07.409]  Had no criminal record, had kids, she's dead now.
[00:57:07.409 --> 00:57:10.570]  No charges for DC cops and moms killing.
[00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:13.853]  You get scared at a checkpoint, you run away, you die.
[00:57:13.853 --> 00:57:15.794]  Same thing in North Korea, it's for our safety.
[00:57:15.794 --> 00:57:17.235]  You know, ISIS might get us.
[00:57:18.103 --> 00:57:28.591]  As one law enforcement publication said, hey, as soon as ISIS hits, people won't be complaining about SWAT teams blowing babies' faces off, and the government publicly runs ISIS.
[00:57:28.591 --> 00:57:30.973]  And our troops will publicly die battling them.
[00:57:30.973 --> 00:57:37.078]  See, because the war's real on the ground, the globalists are above it, playing us off against each other.
[00:57:37.078 --> 00:57:45.125]  Briefly, speaking of abortion, one way they've aborted a lot of kids in this country, is they know full well, just search iodine birth defects.
[00:57:45.959 --> 00:57:46.019]  I'm
[00:58:09.215 --> 00:58:13.784]  It's all the Survival Shield X2 New Nation Iodine and I'm going to take my dose right now.
[00:58:13.784 --> 00:58:15.186]  I already took some this morning.
[00:58:15.186 --> 00:58:16.529]  I take a little more than is recommended.
[00:58:16.529 --> 00:58:19.835]  I've kind of built the dose up and I mix my Super Mel Vitality in.
[00:58:21.618 --> 00:58:27.582]  The best, in my view, male overall stamina, enhancement, libido, you name it.
[00:58:27.582 --> 00:58:30.143]  This stuff is awesome and it funds the InfoWars.
[00:58:30.143 --> 00:58:32.545]  InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:58:37.528 --> 00:58:41.310]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:45.333]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:45.333 --> 00:58:46.554]  So batter up!
[00:58:46.554 --> 00:58:48.275]  And the filthy emperor is in my city.
[00:58:49.537 --> 00:58:56.700]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.062]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:58:59.062 --> 00:59:04.324]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:04.324 --> 00:59:09.506]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:09.506 --> 00:59:12.548]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:12.828 --> 00:59:16.892]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:16.892 --> 00:59:21.217]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:21.217 --> 00:59:31.447]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:31.447 --> 00:59:33.970]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:36.472]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.663 --> 01:00:10.506]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:12.086]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.086 --> 01:00:14.007]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.007 --> 01:00:17.810]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:21.892]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.891 --> 01:00:28.274]  You know, I could joke and say that an actual J.R.R.
[01:00:28.274 --> 01:00:51.633]  Tolkien troll creature was sighted in Columbus, Ohio, but it's actually a Democratic Party voter, totally dumbed down, no future, had their hours cut by Obamacare, works at Burger King, she's in a Burger King uniform, probably a manager, and she just sees pro-lifers and starts assaulting them, hitting them, kicking over their signs, and screaming that they're racist and don't like women.
[01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:58.466]  Because they're at an abortuary that mainly, in that particular city they've got statistics, whacks blacks.
[01:00:58.466 --> 01:01:02.810]  So, again, if you don't want to whack a black, it's racist to use the word black.
[01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:07.254]  You're supposed to use whatever new term they have in the media, not just a human being.
[01:01:07.254 --> 01:01:08.695]  But there you go.
[01:01:08.695 --> 01:01:12.078]  Let's play unedited, except for the beeping.
[01:01:12.078 --> 01:01:16.322]  You can see the one with all the cuss words up on Infowars.com, unedited.
[01:01:16.322 --> 01:01:17.803]  The horror!
[01:01:17.803 --> 01:01:19.384]  When a bottom-dwelling
[01:01:20.265 --> 01:01:22.985]  Culture of death promoting troll.
[01:01:22.985 --> 01:01:24.966]  A chud.
[01:01:24.966 --> 01:01:27.106]  Did they make a movie about that?
[01:01:27.106 --> 01:01:28.426]  Came out of the sewer system.
[01:01:28.426 --> 01:01:30.327]  Here it is.
[01:01:30.327 --> 01:01:35.408]  That is not what a fetus looks like, okay?
[01:01:35.408 --> 01:01:37.768]  It's a clump of cells at 12 weeks.
[01:01:37.768 --> 01:01:40.228]  It does not look like that!
[01:01:40.228 --> 01:01:42.169]  It's a clump of motherf***ing cells!
[01:01:42.169 --> 01:01:44.109]  No hands are shown through that time!
[01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:45.189]  By the way, that's not true.
[01:01:45.189 --> 01:01:45.909]  Put it on screen.
[01:01:45.909 --> 01:01:48.850]  It has a brain and all its fingers at that time.
[01:01:51.822 --> 01:01:53.443]  Get that camera out of my face!
[01:01:53.443 --> 01:02:00.470]  I want to call the police.
[01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:10.059]  Imagine, the feminists now are having babies without men, crossing two women, not across her and Janet Reno.
[01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.200]  We are calling the police, ma'am.
[01:02:14.804 --> 01:02:16.544]  I'm calling the police right now.
[01:02:16.544 --> 01:02:19.205]  What you are is a racist mother f***** as well!
[01:02:19.205 --> 01:02:22.325]  How dare you f***** do this kind of s**t, a**hole!
[01:02:22.325 --> 01:02:24.426]  That's the kind of woman at the gym tells you not to talk.
[01:02:24.426 --> 01:02:26.766]  It's all about how she's in charge.
[01:02:26.766 --> 01:02:27.706]  Go ahead!
[01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:28.946]  She's not happy.
[01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:32.047]  I just love real feminine women.
[01:02:32.047 --> 01:02:34.287]  Oh, magical.
[01:02:34.287 --> 01:02:35.468]  And powerful.
[01:02:35.468 --> 01:02:38.028]  This woman is not powerful, ladies.
[01:02:38.028 --> 01:02:40.428]  All you are, are just a bunch of f***** a**holes!
[01:02:40.428 --> 01:02:41.449]  Are you calling the police?
[01:02:41.449 --> 01:02:43.529]  Are you calling the police?
[01:02:43.529 --> 01:02:44.049]  Back off!
[01:02:45.043 --> 01:02:51.367]  She's actually a total victim of television and brainwashing.
[01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:54.048]  All you are is just a bunch of misogynist motherfuckers.
[01:02:54.048 --> 01:02:55.990]  Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:59.492]  No uterus, no right to talk about it!
[01:02:59.492 --> 01:03:01.933]  Understand me, motherfucker?
[01:03:01.933 --> 01:03:03.674]  I'm listening to you.
[01:03:03.674 --> 01:03:04.935]  No, I don't give a shit!
[01:03:04.935 --> 01:03:07.577]  Get the fuck out of my face now!
[01:03:07.577 --> 01:03:09.558]  Your signs deserve to get fucked up!
[01:03:17.031 --> 01:03:17.591]  Oh, the cops?
[01:03:17.591 --> 01:03:19.693]  Who did the cops go after?
[01:03:19.693 --> 01:03:21.254]  Her?
[01:03:21.254 --> 01:03:23.136]  Anyways, I mean, she's actually a total victim.
[01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:31.962]  I feel sorry for her.
[01:03:31.962 --> 01:03:34.104]  Go ahead, take me.
[01:03:34.104 --> 01:03:35.545]  Your male power.
[01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:38.467]  It's globalist super males that engineered this whole deal.
[01:03:38.467 --> 01:03:41.930]  Take down everybody else, you idiot.
[01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:43.631]  Men and women are together under attack.
[01:03:48.203 --> 01:03:50.925]  But it's okay, she'll say I'm stopping the racist.
[01:03:50.925 --> 01:03:53.226]  The cop will probably come hang the guy by his feet or something.
[01:03:53.226 --> 01:03:55.568]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:03:55.568 --> 01:04:00.871]  Oh my gosh, it is just so frightening to see creatures like that out there.
[01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:07.135]  And... I'm not attacking her because of the way she looks.
[01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:09.476]  Mexican train derails sending 1,300 migrants headed towards the U.S.
[01:04:13.795 --> 01:04:14.435]  Stranding.
[01:04:14.435 --> 01:04:15.796]  Oh my gosh!
[01:04:15.796 --> 01:04:22.840]  One of the trains from Guatemala derailed, and I'm sure that's the fault of Don Johnson.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:30.945]  In fact, I bet Robert Rodriguez will make a movie where Don Johnson is not shooting pregnant Hispanic women, and it's really the cartels doing it.
[01:04:30.945 --> 01:04:33.446]  No, no, Mexico's failed because of white people.
[01:04:33.446 --> 01:04:37.749]  They'll have Don Johnson, like Wally Coate with the detonator, plunging it and it blows up.
[01:04:39.414 --> 01:04:40.775]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:40.775 --> 01:04:44.638]  Seriously, let's hope all these poor folks are okay.
[01:04:44.638 --> 01:04:48.461]  But the trains, uh, has derailed.
[01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:49.422]  Please print me that article.
[01:04:49.422 --> 01:04:50.983]  We're gonna have to talk about that.
[01:04:50.983 --> 01:04:57.629]  The trains are arriving each hour in Texas and California, and the feds are there with the buses to bring them into your town.
[01:04:57.629 --> 01:04:58.710]  You're gonna pay for it, racist.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.842]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:02.842 --> 01:05:07.506]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.

[01:05:53.272 --> 01:05:58.337]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:06.058]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential foreclosure situation?
[01:06:06.058 --> 01:06:09.461]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:06:09.461 --> 01:06:11.142]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[01:06:11.142 --> 01:06:17.508]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:17.508 --> 01:06:23.393]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:06:23.533 --> 01:06:27.495]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:06:27.495 --> 01:06:30.397]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:06:30.397 --> 01:06:38.842]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:06:38.842 --> 01:06:40.943]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:06:40.943 --> 01:06:41.984]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:06:42.344 --> 01:06:51.296]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:07:17.412 --> 01:07:22.035]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:07:22.035 --> 01:07:32.661]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:07:32.661 --> 01:07:39.145]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:08:04.807 --> 01:08:07.609]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.503 --> 01:08:24.108]  Alright, I want to go over these headlines, and then I'm going to open the phones up for callers.

[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:43.672]  Again, here are some of the headlines, some of the top stories.
[01:08:43.672 --> 01:08:46.053]  I'll get into the other stacks I haven't covered yet.
[01:08:46.053 --> 01:08:48.554]  Gun confiscation begins in New York.

[01:09:07.045 --> 01:09:08.706]  High-level NSA official.
[01:09:08.706 --> 01:09:13.731]  The NSA has become J. Edgar Hoover on super steroids, spying on everything.
[01:09:13.731 --> 01:09:19.656]  Blackmailing politicians, generals, judges, lawyers, and citizens.
[01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.399]  That's what it's now all about.
[01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.880]  You want to live in a third world country?
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:25.381]  You do, officially.

[01:09:26.522 --> 01:09:30.486]  70 million people would be starving in the streets without government welfare programs.
[01:09:30.486 --> 01:09:32.668]  That's again the false flag weapon, and they want even more.
[01:09:33.635 --> 01:09:37.236]  The fundamental numbers behind all the propaganda tell a starkly different story.
[01:09:37.236 --> 01:09:44.898]  I want to get to that and the new study that is out breaking that down.
[01:09:44.898 --> 01:09:47.359]  Washington's arrogance will destroy its empire.
[01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.479]  Washington reeks of the stench of evil.
[01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:51.300]  Paul Craig Roberts article.

[01:10:23.183 --> 01:10:24.464]  We told you Cyprus was the test.
[01:10:24.464 --> 01:10:26.805]  It's now starting in Germany and England.
[01:10:26.805 --> 01:10:31.167]  Total, mega-level, red alert, zero hedge, up on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:31.167 --> 01:10:34.349]  Video, crazed abortion advocate attacks peaceful pro-lifers.
[01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:42.055]  I didn't know they were going to come out with Lord of the Rings Hobbit Part 3, the new smog movie early, but they have.
[01:10:42.055 --> 01:10:44.597]  This woman is directly out of that movie.
[01:10:44.597 --> 01:10:47.780]  The video, unedited, is on Infowars.com.
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:51.262]  Japan battered as tropical storm makes landfall.
[01:10:51.262 --> 01:10:54.165]  Three dead as wrecked typhoon hits the island.
[01:10:54.165 --> 01:10:55.266]  May affect Fukushima.
[01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:58.774]  That is just some of the news.
[01:10:58.774 --> 01:11:14.484]  And in this report, at a broadcast cable, journalists accuse White House of politically driven suppression of news, point to public information office controls of interviews, access being controlled at a level never seen in modern history.
[01:11:14.484 --> 01:11:20.107]  Iraq tells UN terrorist groups seize nuclear materials.
[01:11:20.107 --> 01:11:23.409]  But it's ISIS, so the UN says everything's okay.
[01:11:26.618 --> 01:11:30.540]  British politicians are in a secret deal to allow mass surveillance of the public.
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.622]  See, now that all the illegal spying's come out, they're doing secret laws to legalize it.
[01:11:34.622 --> 01:11:38.564]  That's what criminals do.
[01:11:38.564 --> 01:11:51.090]  To keep you safe from ISIS, of course, that they publicly fund, California proposes $500 a day fine for overwatering lawns, launch tattletale scams.
[01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:55.425]  The video's up on Infowars.com.
[01:11:55.425 --> 01:11:58.228]  Alex Jones asks, is Michelle Obama a man?
[01:11:58.228 --> 01:12:06.776]  And I'm actually just reporting on what Joan Rivers said, and looking at the fact that she's built like a linebacker, and, you know, if she was an Olympic athlete, they would order a blood test.
[01:12:06.776 --> 01:12:10.420]  I mean, that's basically what I'm saying, and it's up on Infowars.com.
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:15.004]  So, that's just some of the Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com articles.
[01:12:15.845 --> 01:12:19.226]  Let's move right along to some of the news we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:12:19.226 --> 01:12:21.507]  Breaking in just the last few minutes.
[01:12:21.507 --> 01:12:28.790]  Mexican train derails stranding 1,300 migrants headed towards the U.S.
[01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:36.273]  The train is loaded in Guatemala and normally the government allows no one in who's illegal or you get six months to a year hard labor in prison.
[01:12:37.762 --> 01:12:43.808]  But they allow you to get on the train if you don't get off, and the Mexican military sells them meals and things on the way.
[01:12:43.808 --> 01:12:45.189]  This is mainstream news.
[01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:52.436]  They then arrive in McAllen on the border, or they arrive by the border in San Diego, and they are disgorged.
[01:12:52.436 --> 01:12:56.199]  This is one of dozens of trains, but it's known as the Beast.
[01:12:57.276 --> 01:13:00.699]  A cargo train used by Mexicans and Central Americans to travel towards the U.S.
[01:13:00.699 --> 01:13:15.951]  border, I mean they actually have official trains to do this, derailed in the southern Mexican state of Oaxacana today, or last night, stranding about, I guess today is the day it happened, stranding about 1,300 migrants.
[01:13:15.951 --> 01:13:23.517]  Emergency services said many of the migrants aboard were young people and nobody was injured when the train nicknamed the Beast.
[01:13:23.957 --> 01:13:28.749]  Came off the tracks of spokesman for local emergency services said.
[01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:35.974]  Since last October, more than 50,000, try about half a million, unaccompanied minors.
[01:13:35.974 --> 01:13:39.076]  Oh look, Reuters uses the White House term.
[01:13:39.076 --> 01:13:44.339]  The White House said you will use the term unaccompanied minors or children, and they did.
[01:13:44.339 --> 01:13:51.244]  You use what, and again, 2 plus 2 equals 5, and you didn't build your business, and you can keep your doctor even though you can't.
[01:13:51.244 --> 01:13:54.065]  You do what the Lord and Savior says.
[01:13:54.065 --> 01:13:54.626]  So I like it.
[01:13:55.888 --> 01:13:57.789]  Yeah, Jamie Foxx says he's Lord and Savior.
[01:13:57.789 --> 01:14:05.032]  Since last October, you would have thought Christ came back today with all the highways shut down in Austin, letting the little people know what trash they are.
[01:14:05.032 --> 01:14:13.036]  Since last October, more than 50,000 unaccompanied minors, most from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, have been caught illegally crossing.
[01:14:13.036 --> 01:14:14.617]  They've been advertised to come in.
[01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.899]  99%, according to a leaked ICE memo, are made legal.
[01:14:18.599 --> 01:14:20.479]  And then they're shipped deeper into the U.S.
[01:14:20.479 --> 01:14:21.840]  in air-conditioned buses.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:35.863]  And the word is, if you can just get up there on the cargo train, and there's so many, they load the inside areas that are open, the open boxcars, they load the top, and then they have to hang on to the sides to get in.
[01:14:35.863 --> 01:14:40.924]  There's just so many piling on the trains so fast, tens of thousands a day.
[01:14:40.924 --> 01:14:43.185]  Dozens of trains a day arrive, 1,300 per train.
[01:14:49.178 --> 01:14:54.081]  I mean, look at some of those photos, just hundreds and thousands just piling in.
[01:14:54.081 --> 01:14:59.523]  Free welfare, voter ID, driver's license, blah, blah, blah.
[01:14:59.523 --> 01:15:04.026]  And again, they're just giant, poor, desperate, ignorant masses that don't know any better.
[01:15:04.026 --> 01:15:05.346]  And I don't even blame them wanting to come here.
[01:15:05.346 --> 01:15:10.429]  A lot of them amputees, diabetes, you name it, they can't be taken care of.
[01:15:10.429 --> 01:15:13.010]  They're coming, they're coming, they're coming, they're coming.
[01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:14.271]  And this is just the beginning.
[01:15:15.606 --> 01:15:22.593]  But there's also gangs, MS-13, mules, narcotics traffickers, as the border completely collapses.
[01:15:22.593 --> 01:15:26.918]  I mean, this just makes my head spin how epic this is.
[01:15:26.918 --> 01:15:32.403]  Children say they're fleeing violence at home and hope they will be able to stay in the United States.
[01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:36.828]  Several days of heavy rain in southern Mexico may have caused the train to derail, authorities said.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:53.649]  And AP and Reuters keep acting like no one knows why they're illegal or why they're showing up while Obama gives them weekly awards and says come on up and Biden says come on up and 99% it was 80% weren't being deported a few months ago 99% 99% 99 99 99 99 don't they have a song called 99 from the 60s?
[01:16:07.794 --> 01:16:10.658]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:16:10.658 --> 01:16:14.442]  I know they have a misfits song that goes, we all want 38!
[01:16:14.442 --> 01:16:15.804]  We all want 38!
[01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:16.604]  We all want 38!
[01:16:16.604 --> 01:16:17.445]  The point is, is that
[01:16:24.195 --> 01:16:26.696]  There's 700 plus million people down there.
[01:16:26.696 --> 01:16:29.917]  The population's doubling every 23 years on average.
[01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:31.877]  And it is the conquering!
[01:16:31.877 --> 01:16:33.438]  And the joke is, it's true!
[01:16:33.438 --> 01:16:36.679]  You can say Europeans conquered things and built a lot of stuff.
[01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:38.079]  Also engaged in atrocities.
[01:16:38.079 --> 01:16:39.479]  The natives engaged in those as well.
[01:16:39.479 --> 01:16:40.560]  I'm not excusing any of it.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.780]  It's just human activity.
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:50.783]  And now we're this civilized, trendy culture that are taught, you know, how to wear unmatching socks and have big beards and be trendy all day and just 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:16:52.063 --> 01:16:54.965]  And then now the Democrats are being paid to bring them into their houses.
[01:16:54.965 --> 01:16:57.046]  It's a total racket!
[01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:59.487]  A total implosion!
[01:16:59.487 --> 01:17:09.112]  And you've got, by the way, I haven't even covered this yet, if you look it up, George Soros is behind the same Open Border Society that overthrew Ukraine, is behind this.
[01:17:09.112 --> 01:17:16.096]  And I need to get our writers, if you just search George Soros behind immigrant wave, he's publicly behind it as usual.
[01:17:16.096 --> 01:17:19.258]  You cannot get rid of him like cockroaches
[01:17:21.013 --> 01:17:23.896]  Or like the plague, or like death and taxes.
[01:17:23.896 --> 01:17:36.630]  George Soros, when he was 14, 15, 16, 17, aided the Nazis in Romania and other areas, rounding up fellow Jews, and gave a 60 Minutes interview proud of it, so he gets ADL awards.
[01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:39.954]  My grandfathers that fought the Nazis have been dead for a long time.
[01:17:39.954 --> 01:17:41.535]  One of them for 10 years, one of them for more than 20.
[01:17:42.605 --> 01:18:03.584]  They're dead in the ground, and George Soros, evergreen, has $10 billion plus, is tax-exempt, and is just overthrowing, funding Al-Qaeda groups, Arab Springs, Nazis overthrowing Ukraine, giant immigrant implosions, abortuaries, and he wants weed everywhere and legalize, so everybody's stoned out of their gourd.
[01:18:03.584 --> 01:18:05.225]  And again, I'm against the drug war.
[01:18:05.225 --> 01:18:07.828]  But he's for legalization for the wrong reason.
[01:18:09.175 --> 01:18:10.296]  And by the way, I've figured it out.
[01:18:10.296 --> 01:18:11.396]  It's not legalization.
[01:18:11.396 --> 01:18:16.919]  They make you waive your rights for medical marijuana and go into the social services, and it's even worse than it being illegal.
[01:18:16.919 --> 01:18:18.761]  I mean, they just want a cut of it.
[01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:22.323]  Soros admits responsibility for the coup and mass murder in Ukraine.
[01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:23.483]  Go read the article.
[01:18:23.483 --> 01:18:34.950]  He's proud of it, and of course, this human tick, this demon, this disease, this walking vampire,
[01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:37.181]  There it is.
[01:18:37.181 --> 01:18:46.926]  Soros and fellow billionaires for Open Borders lobbied GOP on amnesty last year.
[01:18:46.926 --> 01:18:50.147]  But if you look at it, he is behind it all.
[01:18:50.147 --> 01:18:53.549]  And Robert Rodriguez and their new race cult TV station.
[01:18:53.549 --> 01:18:58.931]  And he's getting money from Obama under the table on that, the word is.
[01:18:58.931 --> 01:19:00.812]  So, this is it.
[01:19:00.812 --> 01:19:05.354]  We are being conquered, period, by absolute total criminal activity.
[01:19:06.872 --> 01:19:07.732]  Look at this headline.
[01:19:07.732 --> 01:19:10.673]  Obama, no interest in border photo op.
[01:19:10.673 --> 01:19:15.355]  All he runs around getting money from rich Democrat billionaires that all have government contracts.
[01:19:15.355 --> 01:19:22.317]  Democratic Rep says White House called me speaking out against the President saying he should be down on the border.
[01:19:24.161 --> 01:19:27.863]  Pro-amnesty socialists flood Marietta City Hall.
[01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:33.686]  Amnesty activists hold signs stating, Open the Borders, Freedom Socialist Party, and immigrants welcome here.
[01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:35.727]  Our reporters got video of this.
[01:19:35.727 --> 01:19:41.070]  And ladies and gentlemen, they admit, no, we're going to flood the country and turn it socialist, Cloward and Pivitt.
[01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:42.111]  So you're for Cloward and Pivitt.
[01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:42.851]  Yes, we are.
[01:19:42.851 --> 01:19:44.032]  Yes, we're taking over.
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.141]  You'll be at a FEMA catch soon enough.
[01:19:47.141 --> 01:19:47.901]  Rule!
[01:19:47.901 --> 01:19:48.702]  Power!
[01:19:48.702 --> 01:19:49.522]  Rise!
[01:19:49.522 --> 01:19:51.563]  Rise of the scum!
[01:19:51.563 --> 01:19:53.284]  Rise of people who don't work!
[01:19:53.284 --> 01:19:54.785]  Ruling everything!
[01:19:54.785 --> 01:19:57.486]  And the SWAT teams and helicopters are ours!
[01:19:57.486 --> 01:19:58.847]  America is ours!
[01:20:00.051 --> 01:20:01.772]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[01:20:01.772 --> 01:20:06.934]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[01:20:06.934 --> 01:20:13.997]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[01:20:13.997 --> 01:20:18.439]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:21.260]  But a friend and patriot has discovered a loophole.
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:26.742]  Find out about the NSA loophole before they shut it down at privacylockdown.com.
[01:20:26.742 --> 01:20:28.243]  That's privacylockdown.com.
[01:20:29.443 --> 01:20:38.730]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:39.531]  This capitalism?
[01:20:39.531 --> 01:20:45.695]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:45.695 --> 01:20:49.398]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:20:49.398 --> 01:20:50.339]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:21:58.686 --> 01:22:01.529]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:01.529 --> 01:22:06.653]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.653 --> 01:22:14.780]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:19.305]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:19.305 --> 01:22:23.108]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:23.248 --> 01:22:29.212]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:29.212 --> 01:22:32.374]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[01:23:27.779 --> 01:23:32.540]  There's one major factor affecting the health of millions, and most people are completely unaware.
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:38.222]  Acid levels, soda, meat, dairy, caffeine, and sugar can all lead to elevated acid levels in the body.

[01:24:00.239 --> 01:24:02.982]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:24:02.982 --> 01:24:12.911]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:12.911 --> 01:24:16.975]  The West is degenerating into a total tyranny.
[01:24:16.975 --> 01:24:18.817]  The West is also not having children.
[01:24:18.817 --> 01:24:21.540]  I don't care if it's Japan, Germany or the United States.
[01:24:25.106 --> 01:24:39.810]  And the establishment has decided to tie the corporate globalism to giant immigrant movements in the third world that way outnumber what's left in the West as a way to politically totally dominate what's left of Western values.
[01:24:39.810 --> 01:24:41.510]  It's that simple.
[01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:46.492]  Quote Hispanics are having children, whites and blacks aren't.
[01:24:46.492 --> 01:24:54.174]  So Hispanics have already basically inherited what's left of the West, if they want.
[01:24:55.285 --> 01:24:57.066]  But the globalists don't want that.
[01:24:57.066 --> 01:25:04.308]  But if you look at things from a racial perspective, the, quote, Hispanics have won from the Robert Rodriguez race base.
[01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:05.688]  And so that's why they go with it.
[01:25:05.688 --> 01:25:12.790]  But they add, turn your guns in, have abortions, world government, socialism, men are bad.
[01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:14.791]  Why would Hispanics want to embrace something like that?
[01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:38.111]  Well because it's dumbed down politically like everybody else and so it's kosher and acceptable to be racist if you're Hispanic and it's sold by the Spanish-speaking media so it's perfect that other Americans don't know what's going on and the Democrats are going back to their Klan policy that they left in the 60s of trying to get whites to be racist and be racially based.
[01:25:38.111 --> 01:25:41.113]  Whites rejected it because of Christian movements mainly.
[01:25:41.113 --> 01:25:42.595]  This is real sociology you're hearing.
[01:25:43.717 --> 01:25:44.858]  The real history.
[01:25:44.858 --> 01:25:49.903]  And so, the Democrats then went into race-based politics with minorities.
[01:25:49.903 --> 01:25:53.746]  And now they've gotten the minority level up to majority, they go.
[01:25:53.746 --> 01:25:57.149]  Part of being a minority is, you don't have a man in the house.
[01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:59.651]  Part of being a minority is, you turn your guns in.
[01:25:59.651 --> 01:26:02.193]  Part of being a minority is, you're on welfare.
[01:26:02.193 --> 01:26:04.075]  That's how you beat what?
[01:26:04.075 --> 01:26:05.917]  The whitey.
[01:26:05.917 --> 01:26:06.858]  How do you beat a whitey?
[01:26:06.858 --> 01:26:08.159]  If you're black, kill your baby.
[01:26:09.301 --> 01:26:12.304]  So white people go to an abortuary and say, don't kill your black baby?
[01:26:12.304 --> 01:26:16.068]  People come out and say, get out of here racists and attack them.
[01:26:16.068 --> 01:26:23.375]  If you want to stick a suction needle in the back of a baby's head and suck its brains out, you'll be given literal awards.
[01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:30.923]  You can go to Southern Poverty Law Center events, ADL events, Planned Parenthood events, they give each other awards at these things.
[01:26:30.923 --> 01:26:31.384]  Awards.
[01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:36.891]  So, this is how it works.
[01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:41.293]  Totally dumbed down, race-based system, total takeover of society.
[01:26:41.293 --> 01:26:42.654]  A long segment's coming up.
[01:26:42.654 --> 01:26:49.057]  When we come back, Eric, Mike, Oz, Joe, Derek, and many others, we're going to go to all of you.
[01:26:49.057 --> 01:26:53.059]  As you hear callers hang up, it's your chance to call in.
[01:26:53.059 --> 01:26:54.460]  But finishing up with these headlines.
[01:26:56.050 --> 01:27:04.936]  One of the dozens of trains that arrives every day derail 1,300 illegal aliens from South America, Central America, allowed to travel through Mexico to the U.S.
[01:27:06.949 --> 01:27:10.250]  Again, Obama has no interest in border photo ops.
[01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:11.551]  Pro-amnesty socialists.
[01:27:11.551 --> 01:27:15.492]  This is the big article on Infowars.com that needs to go viral.
[01:27:15.492 --> 01:27:16.933]  We have a video and photos.
[01:27:16.933 --> 01:27:20.694]  Pro-amnesty socialists flood Marietta City Hall.
[01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:22.495]  They only had one person there before.
[01:27:22.495 --> 01:27:24.056]  It was pro-open border.
[01:27:24.056 --> 01:27:26.397]  But now they bust them in from L.A.
[01:27:26.397 --> 01:27:27.317]  And it says immediate
[01:27:31.536 --> 01:27:32.877]  Legalization.
[01:27:32.877 --> 01:27:34.639]  Unconditional legalization.
[01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:37.002]  OpenTheBordersSocialism.com.
[01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:38.343]  And it has their phone number.
[01:27:38.343 --> 01:27:42.667]  Immigrants, welcome here.
[01:27:42.667 --> 01:27:43.648]  And then it just goes on.
[01:27:43.648 --> 01:27:51.036]  I mean, it's literal communists who just want to sit around on their fat butts all day and just wreck countries.
[01:27:51.036 --> 01:27:55.300]  And these immigrants from Central America have been primed to be communists.
[01:27:56.716 --> 01:27:58.498]  And it's game over, folks!
[01:27:58.498 --> 01:28:00.040]  Game over, man!
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.261]  They cut the power!
[01:28:01.261 --> 01:28:02.002]  Game over!
[01:28:02.002 --> 01:28:05.145]  Can we pull that up, please, from aliens?
[01:28:05.145 --> 01:28:05.906]  So, whatever.
[01:28:05.906 --> 01:28:10.511]  You know, people that know how to produce and work will always be fine.
[01:28:10.511 --> 01:28:13.294]  It's the middle class, the lower middle class, and the working class.
[01:28:13.294 --> 01:28:13.875]  You're screwed.
[01:28:15.475 --> 01:28:21.939]  And this is going to hurt nobody more than it's going to hurt Hispanic Americans, who are really the future of America.
[01:28:21.939 --> 01:28:27.303]  And the globalists know that, and they want you under the wings of the New World Order.
[01:28:27.303 --> 01:28:32.286]  Under the black wings of death and abortion, and you're going to be just like the black community now.
[01:28:35.523 --> 01:28:36.763]  Petition!
[01:28:36.763 --> 01:28:40.204]  Let's put up unaccompanied illegals at the White House.
[01:28:40.204 --> 01:28:42.965]  It's time Obama and Democrats take ownership of the problem.
[01:28:42.965 --> 01:28:45.286]  Infowars.com, put that petition out.
[01:28:45.286 --> 01:28:47.706]  Please go to Infowars.com and sign it.
[01:28:47.706 --> 01:28:52.287]  Governor Rick Perry breaks promise not to shake Obama's hand during meeting.
[01:28:52.287 --> 01:28:55.528]  Yeah, Perry always says the right thing and then does the wrong thing.
[01:28:55.528 --> 01:29:01.730]  I wouldn't be surprised if him and Obama weren't going to the Tunnel of Love on those little paddle swans they have down on the lake down there.
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:04.661]  Birds of a feather fly together.
[01:29:04.661 --> 01:29:07.163]  They might have had Michael Obama there as well.
[01:29:07.163 --> 01:29:12.786]  I'm sorry, I can't help it.
[01:29:12.786 --> 01:29:15.927]  Obama's illegitimate son is Michael Obama.
[01:29:15.927 --> 01:29:17.748]  From the snapping turtle.
[01:29:17.748 --> 01:29:23.731]  Obama, there is nothing happening at the border that I am not intimately aware of.
[01:29:23.731 --> 01:29:27.113]  Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen it.
[01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:29.054]  I need that clip coming back, guys.
[01:29:29.054 --> 01:29:30.195]  What an incredible clip.
[01:29:31.571 --> 01:29:36.075]  Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
[01:29:36.075 --> 01:29:38.437]  The NSA is spying on everyone.
[01:29:38.437 --> 01:29:42.620]  We'll launder so much money through these illegals, you chump Americans.
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:44.322]  I'm a master gangster.
[01:29:44.322 --> 01:29:48.665]  Now take your vaccines, drink your fluoride.
[01:29:48.665 --> 01:29:50.086]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.086 --> 01:29:51.688]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.688 --> 01:29:55.311]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.129 --> 01:30:06.298]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:06.298 --> 01:30:10.865]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:10.865 --> 01:30:15.412]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:15.812 --> 01:30:18.753]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:18.753 --> 01:30:24.195]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:24.195 --> 01:30:31.577]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:31.577 --> 01:30:35.698]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:35.698 --> 01:30:40.820]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:41.680]  This is innovating.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:49.445]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:49.445 --> 01:30:53.707]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:53.707 --> 01:30:58.911]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super Detox Special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.261]  I taste dirt in it.
[01:31:01.261 --> 01:31:02.603]  God knows what's in there.
[01:31:02.603 --> 01:31:06.887]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:31:06.887 --> 01:31:12.893]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:31:12.893 --> 01:31:14.015]  That one is better.
[01:31:14.015 --> 01:31:15.236]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:16.697]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[01:31:16.697 --> 01:31:17.218]  It's good water.
[01:31:17.318 --> 01:31:23.359]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:31:23.359 --> 01:31:30.700]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:33.421]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:41.602]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:31:41.602 --> 01:31:43.083]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:31:43.083 --> 01:31:43.863]  It's good water.
[01:31:43.863 --> 01:31:44.323]  Refreshing.
[01:31:44.323 --> 01:31:44.823]  It's good!

[01:32:00.151 --> 01:32:02.433]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[01:32:02.433 --> 01:32:09.857]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:20.685]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:32:20.685 --> 01:32:29.931]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:32:30.651 --> 01:32:34.714]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:32:34.714 --> 01:32:38.477]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:32:38.477 --> 01:32:40.538]  Experience the new formula.
[01:32:40.538 --> 01:32:43.120]  Experience the ancient purity.

[01:33:05.504 --> 01:33:10.529]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:10.529 --> 01:33:12.091]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.271 --> 01:34:00.496]  Drudge has the most incredible photo of the death train, known as the Beefed, with what looks like 5,000 or more illegals, not 1,300, coming into the United States.
[01:34:00.496 --> 01:34:02.557]  And again, these death trains arrive
[01:34:03.786 --> 01:34:08.848]  People die falling off of them, and I'm not laughing because they're dying.
[01:34:08.848 --> 01:34:13.350]  I'm laughing because this country is such a joke.
[01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:14.451]  Let me hear Waylon Jennings for a minute.
[01:34:14.451 --> 01:34:15.071]  It'll make me feel better.
[01:34:21.347 --> 01:34:24.168]  Just a touch of sadness.
[01:34:24.168 --> 01:34:25.428]  Thunder.
[01:34:25.428 --> 01:34:27.109]  And we're gonna rise.
[01:34:39.195 --> 01:34:43.098]  Maybe I should just go to a music show.
[01:34:43.098 --> 01:34:49.242]  Ride like the one-eyed Jack of Diamonds.
[01:34:49.242 --> 01:34:51.584]  With the devil close behind.
[01:34:51.584 --> 01:34:54.646]  I don't need your phone calls, that's enough of me.
[01:34:54.646 --> 01:34:58.528]  Let me direct you though to InfoWars.com.
[01:34:58.528 --> 01:35:00.189]  Well first, let's just read those drudge headlines.
[01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:02.051]  There's so many more coming out.
[01:35:02.051 --> 01:35:04.512]  It's making my head spin at this point.
[01:35:04.512 --> 01:35:06.454]  Death train derails in Mexico.
[01:35:09.055 --> 01:35:11.218]  1,300 migrants headed towards U.S.
[01:35:11.218 --> 01:35:12.700]  on one train alone.
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:17.025]  Photos Obama laughs his way through border meeting.
[01:35:17.025 --> 01:35:19.048]  Perry, I don't know if he heard me.
[01:35:21.104 --> 01:35:24.887]  Houston Black Woman goes on epic rant about illegals.
[01:35:24.887 --> 01:35:26.688]  We have that video coming up.
[01:35:26.688 --> 01:35:27.409]  It's an awesome video.
[01:35:27.409 --> 01:35:28.569]  I'll put that up for calls.
[01:35:28.569 --> 01:35:29.070]  Video.
[01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:32.012]  African Americans confront immigrant supporters.
[01:35:32.012 --> 01:35:34.794]  Amnesty disaster for black workers.
[01:35:34.794 --> 01:35:37.496]  It's a disaster for Hispanic workers as well.
[01:35:37.496 --> 01:35:43.240]  Except when you get a Spanish speaking assembly line or restaurant or meat packing.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.541]  When you go, it's on record.
[01:35:45.001 --> 01:35:46.302]  It's taught in colleges now.
[01:35:46.302 --> 01:35:47.544]  It's been going on so long.
[01:35:47.544 --> 01:35:49.365]  Meatpacking restaurants, you name it.
[01:35:49.365 --> 01:35:51.047]  If you don't speak Spanish, you can't work there.
[01:35:51.047 --> 01:35:53.369]  Well, who does that hit?
[01:35:53.369 --> 01:35:57.213]  It hits poor whites and poor blacks.
[01:35:57.213 --> 01:35:59.255]  And that's just the way it is, folks.
[01:35:59.255 --> 01:36:01.437]  So, get used to it.
[01:36:01.437 --> 01:36:07.323]  And again, once America collapses, it's not going to help Central and South America that is in collapse right now.
[01:36:07.323 --> 01:36:09.005]  Now, I noticed this this morning.
[01:36:10.836 --> 01:36:15.038]  And Curt Nemo has documented it now at Infowars.com.
[01:36:15.038 --> 01:36:26.722]  We put the petition up at about 2 o'clock yesterday at the end of the show to have the illegals, and of course it's a joke petition to point out what a fraud this is, to Democratic Party leaders' houses, the White House and D.C.
[01:36:26.722 --> 01:36:30.884]  have a Democratic Party with their billions of campaign contributions to pay for it.
[01:36:32.919 --> 01:36:39.284]  And we've had petitions that have gotten, again, a half a million signatures that have become national news that the White House has been forced to respond to.
[01:36:39.284 --> 01:36:41.085]  We've had a bunch of them.
[01:36:41.085 --> 01:36:43.186]  We hadn't done one in a while.
[01:36:43.186 --> 01:36:48.270]  I get up this morning, about 6.37, I go in, there's one signature.
[01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:52.833]  Alex Jones, when I set up the petition.
[01:36:52.833 --> 01:36:57.437]  Biggs did one kind of like it, but I wanted to expand on it, so I did one with Kurt yesterday, and he wrote an article about it.
[01:36:57.437 --> 01:36:58.898]  And I thought, man, I've never seen that happen before.
[01:36:58.898 --> 01:37:00.619]  We usually get sign-ups immediately.
[01:37:02.307 --> 01:37:07.888]  It wasn't until about an hour ago that they took the block off.
[01:37:07.888 --> 01:37:13.950]  So, Alex Jones petition languages on White House website, inoperable for more than 12 hours.
[01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:14.950]  That's a great headline, Kirby.
[01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:22.112]  You might just say, White House blocks illegal alien petition or something.
[01:37:23.530 --> 01:37:25.331]  Because, I mean, that's what they did.
[01:37:25.331 --> 01:37:27.633]  And see, they know, they have algorithms.
[01:37:27.633 --> 01:37:32.897]  If they block something right when it goes up, right when it goes on Facebook and Twitter, then people give up and leave.
[01:37:32.897 --> 01:37:37.800]  So, even if they game this, we have to prove it's totally gamed with the petitions.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.681]  This is where they act like they're listening to you.
[01:37:39.681 --> 01:37:43.204]  It has no effect anyways, except it publicly is a bully pulpit.
[01:37:43.204 --> 01:37:48.928]  Go to InfoWars.com, go into the petition, and sign it.
[01:37:48.928 --> 01:37:51.490]  Go into it and sign the petition.
[01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:55.491]  That now has 496 signatures.
[01:37:55.491 --> 01:37:59.033]  Does anyone believe that?
[01:37:59.033 --> 01:38:00.133]  Does anyone believe that?
[01:38:00.133 --> 01:38:05.977]  So, InfoWars.com, help us test this out.
[01:38:05.977 --> 01:38:14.041]  Now before I go to your calls, I want to mention a few of the other headlines that are on the homepage of PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:38:14.041 --> 01:38:18.924]  Ted Cruz, Democrats vote to ban books, repeal First Amendment,
[01:38:20.336 --> 01:38:22.177]  That's what they're currently doing.
[01:38:22.177 --> 01:38:26.700]  We've got British politicians in a secret deal to allow mass public surveillance.
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.781]  Yeah, that's just like they're putting microphones up in public everywhere.
[01:38:28.781 --> 01:38:32.544]  They've been doing it for a long time, but now they're denouncing it to the slaves.
[01:38:32.544 --> 01:38:35.026]  Do I get the apologies now that everything I said has come true?
[01:38:35.026 --> 01:38:37.627]  It didn't come true, it was already there.
[01:38:37.627 --> 01:38:38.568]  Don't people understand that?
[01:38:40.399 --> 01:38:47.603]  Again, a very important video I shot yesterday paralleling Obama to Nixon and the need for impeachment.
[01:38:47.603 --> 01:38:49.044]  Obama must fall.
[01:38:49.044 --> 01:38:52.605]  I put out my case that the Republicans need to be scared as well.
[01:38:52.605 --> 01:38:55.847]  The system needs to be put in check.
[01:38:55.847 --> 01:38:59.189]  Well, if we just let him be a big criminal, that'll make the Democrats unpopular.
[01:38:59.189 --> 01:39:00.129]  No, it won't!
[01:39:00.129 --> 01:39:03.471]  He'll ship 20 million illegal kids in who are 15 years old.
[01:39:03.471 --> 01:39:06.533]  They'll be voting with fake IDs.
[01:39:06.533 --> 01:39:08.173]  It's game over!
[01:39:08.173 --> 01:39:08.994]  Game over, man!
[01:39:10.353 --> 01:39:11.794]  That's what we're coming down to here.
[01:39:11.794 --> 01:39:18.479]  And again, I warned you about Obamacare and the giant screw job that it is.
[01:39:18.479 --> 01:39:20.440]  But people don't listen.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.222]  They're like, shut up, cracker head.
[01:39:23.222 --> 01:39:28.786]  You just don't want people getting some free health care, you racist, lazy cracker butt.
[01:39:28.786 --> 01:39:30.968]  I'm going to get me some free health care.
[01:39:32.202 --> 01:39:36.686]  And yeah, they just watered down Medicare-Medicaid that was already there, down to almost nothing.
[01:39:36.686 --> 01:39:42.010]  Do we have the clip of Obama where he said that he's intimately aware of everything going on on the border?
[01:39:42.010 --> 01:39:43.551]  And that's actually true!
[01:39:43.551 --> 01:39:46.233]  He's the one that basically ordered the whole thing open.
[01:39:46.233 --> 01:39:47.695]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:39:47.695 --> 01:39:52.799]  You know, Jay Johnson has now visited, at my direction, the border five times.
[01:39:52.799 --> 01:39:54.060]  He's going for a sixth.
[01:39:55.126 --> 01:39:58.748]  When he goes places he changes his accent slightly and that's NLP type weird mumbo jumbo.
[01:39:58.748 --> 01:40:00.929]  I don't think it's even real at that point.
[01:40:25.742 --> 01:40:29.683]  That's like Hillary when she goes to Kentucky, goes, how y'all doing down there?
[01:40:29.683 --> 01:40:33.164]  Good to see you!
[01:40:33.164 --> 01:40:34.885]  And then when she, literally, we can play the clip.
[01:40:34.885 --> 01:40:38.005]  Then when she goes to New York, she's like, how you doing down here?
[01:40:38.005 --> 01:40:39.466]  It's good to see ya.
[01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:43.207]  I talk like Bugs Bunny meets the Mafia.
[01:40:43.207 --> 01:40:44.407]  We're doing real well.
[01:40:44.407 --> 01:40:47.028]  Hey, hey, hey, Luigi over here.
[01:40:47.028 --> 01:40:49.629]  What's going on, huh?
[01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:52.809]  I mean, that's how fake it all is.
[01:40:52.809 --> 01:40:54.270]  He might be an android.
[01:40:55.165 --> 01:41:00.266]  In fact, I think he probably is actually a robot, and his wife is actually the Merman from He-Man.
[01:41:00.266 --> 01:41:01.487]  I think it's official.
[01:41:01.487 --> 01:41:04.848]  I'm being sarcastic, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:04.848 --> 01:41:09.989]  Even though she didn't put on a Halloween costume, she is the Merman.
[01:41:09.989 --> 01:41:13.750]  I wonder if she wears 6X underwear.
[01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.571]  43,000 pairs of 6X underwear.
[01:41:15.571 --> 01:41:17.632]  That's how many illegals are going to ship in.
[01:41:17.632 --> 01:41:20.232]  They think they're going to have tens of thousands of people.
[01:41:20.232 --> 01:41:22.693]  They have to special order underwear for them.
[01:41:23.462 --> 01:41:25.134]  It's probably why the train derailed.
[01:41:25.134 --> 01:41:26.001]  They put too many.
[01:41:28.152 --> 01:41:29.012]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:29.012 --> 01:41:30.093]  Folks, here's the deal.
[01:41:30.093 --> 01:41:50.021]  Latin America is collapsing, and I'm just laughing, because all you idiot yuppies who can't get a job with all your fake, you know, garbage $300,000, $200,000 degrees that have been a fraud for 20 years, all you were taught in college was how to be brainwashed and be a liberal, trendy, mindless fascist who goes around henpecking everyone.
[01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:50.862]  You're a joke!
[01:41:50.862 --> 01:41:51.982]  You're a fraud!
[01:41:51.982 --> 01:41:53.002]  You're a failure!
[01:41:53.002 --> 01:41:53.743]  You're an idiot!
[01:41:54.463 --> 01:42:00.608]  And only admitting that can turn this around, and we don't have long, dumb butt.
[01:42:00.608 --> 01:42:01.909]  Okay?
[01:42:01.909 --> 01:42:10.435]  I'm talking to all of you out there that think you've arrived because you're part of a surly, peer-pressure gang mentality of snot-nosed behavior.
[01:42:10.435 --> 01:42:13.578]  You people are jokes!
[01:42:13.578 --> 01:42:16.040]  You've been promised you'll be the head of the new political class?
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:20.023]  You're gonna be nothing!
[01:42:20.023 --> 01:42:20.343]  Anyways.
[01:42:21.886 --> 01:42:23.466]  I'm going to go back to your calls here.
[01:42:23.466 --> 01:42:24.887]  I never have gone to the calls.
[01:42:24.887 --> 01:42:29.588]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a moment, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:29.588 --> 01:42:31.869]  I'm not going to be depressed about this, okay?
[01:42:31.869 --> 01:42:38.070]  I tried to put the fire out as Rome burned, but if everybody wants to dance around and have fun, then more power to you.
[01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:46.913]  But when this sucker goes belly up and you've got 101 million people that are on welfare, 70 plus million that would starve to death in a matter of weeks without it,
[01:42:49.353 --> 01:42:50.453]  Game over.
[01:42:50.453 --> 01:42:53.634]  It is serious game over.
[01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.635]  Can we just loop that for everybody?
[01:42:55.635 --> 01:42:59.876]  Just loop it, please.
[01:42:59.876 --> 01:43:00.856]  See, it's game over.
[01:43:00.856 --> 01:43:03.477]  We can't even play game over here now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:03.477 --> 01:43:05.697]  I don't even care if it's a loop.
[01:43:05.697 --> 01:43:06.757]  Just hit it over and over again.
[01:43:06.757 --> 01:43:09.078]  I need to hear game over, game over, game over.
[01:43:09.078 --> 01:43:10.999]  In fact, that could be the new American flag.
[01:43:10.999 --> 01:43:12.899]  Game over.
[01:43:12.899 --> 01:43:14.739]  Everyone's an idiot but thinks they're a winner.
[01:43:14.739 --> 01:43:15.580]  Game over, man.
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:16.580]  It's game over.
[01:43:18.755 --> 01:43:19.215]  Exactly.
[01:43:19.215 --> 01:43:22.497]  It's game over, man!
[01:43:22.497 --> 01:43:28.881]  It's game over!
[01:43:28.881 --> 01:43:29.882]  I love it!
[01:43:29.882 --> 01:43:32.184]  All you fake government people think you're invincible.
[01:43:32.184 --> 01:43:38.928]  You're nothing but a bunch of delusional narcissists imagining what big powerful winners you are when you're incredible failures.
[01:43:38.928 --> 01:43:46.813]  And you know deep down you're a cowardly scum and everything you've got's gonna be sucked out of you by the criminal operation so you cower in fear to it.
[01:43:49.201 --> 01:43:55.363]  All right, briefly here, ladies and gentlemen, I think I'm going to double down today with even more iodine.
[01:43:55.363 --> 01:44:02.466]  Now I suggest you consult with your physician before you take the recommended daily allowance of the survival shield.
[01:44:04.759 --> 01:44:05.820]  X2.
[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:10.523]  We still sell the original, very powerful, pure iodine.
[01:44:10.523 --> 01:44:12.505]  Purest out there until X2 came out.
[01:44:12.505 --> 01:44:13.586]  From the Deep Earth Crystals.
[01:44:13.586 --> 01:44:15.347]  Nobody else has this.
[01:44:15.347 --> 01:44:17.448]  All the other stuff's from Seaweed Base.
[01:44:17.448 --> 01:44:20.211]  And you can go see the videos at Infowarsandlife.com.
[01:44:20.211 --> 01:44:25.254]  And your support of the transmission funds this entire operation.
[01:44:25.254 --> 01:44:32.179]  Super Metal Vitality is turning this Jabba the Hutt creature into a little closer
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:35.401]  To what I used to look like.
[01:44:35.401 --> 01:44:37.441]  And it's really helping me out a lot and just amazing.
[01:44:37.441 --> 01:44:41.622]  And Dr. Group is really cool doing this formulation for us and it funds the operation.
[01:44:41.622 --> 01:44:48.504]  So if you don't want to run the white flag up, you might want to actually support us and buy some of the great products, but also get some really great products for yourself.
[01:44:48.504 --> 01:44:49.585]  So take the challenge.
[01:44:49.585 --> 01:44:51.185]  Get the Super Mill Vitality.
[01:44:51.185 --> 01:44:54.306]  Get the Survival Shield X2 or the original Survival Shield.
[01:44:54.306 --> 01:44:56.687]  Get all the other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:44:56.687 --> 01:44:58.347]  Check out the informational videos there.
[01:44:58.347 --> 01:45:00.748]  See the incredible purple crystals for yourself.
[01:45:01.628 --> 01:45:05.590]  And find out from Dr. Group and others what they do and why this iodine is so special.
[01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:07.010]  Why iodine is so special, period.
[01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:10.172]  But this iodine is like iodine squared in my view.
[01:45:10.172 --> 01:45:14.614]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:14.614 --> 01:45:24.278]  And again we have Infowarsstore.com with all the great books, videos, films, high quality water filters just kind of with promo code water.
[01:45:25.959 --> 01:45:33.543]  All we can do is take control of our own lives, get prepared ourselves, and wake others up, because the whole world's going to go into crazy town from here on out.
[01:45:33.543 --> 01:45:35.344]  And I've been telling you that for years, now it's here.
[01:45:35.344 --> 01:45:36.104]  The beginning.
[01:45:36.104 --> 01:45:42.027]  So hey, at least we know what's going on, we're informed, and we're going to get to see the yuppies beg for mommy.
[01:45:42.027 --> 01:45:45.389]  Which I don't get pleasure out of, except at one level.
[01:45:45.389 --> 01:45:53.693]  Because they, the trendies and people, even though they've been brainwashed from birth, they've gone along with a lot of this, and they're not going to be smiling too much longer, are they?
[01:45:54.582 --> 01:46:02.126]  So again, InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, rated at 8, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 9.
[01:46:02.126 --> 01:46:09.111]  And with the iodine, with the super male, we have the super female that's getting even more rave reviews from women.
[01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:14.314]  Women love the super male, but the super female, I'll tell you, it's good stuff.
[01:46:14.314 --> 01:46:16.515]  I've been taking it, but I've been taking the super male.
[01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:24.452]  I'm not wanting beer anymore either.
[01:46:24.452 --> 01:46:26.534]  I just want this.
[01:46:26.534 --> 01:46:29.377]  It's my little cocktail in the evening as well.
[01:46:29.377 --> 01:46:36.404]  Super mail in the morning, super mail at the lunch time, super mail in the evening.
[01:46:36.404 --> 01:46:37.825]  How's that song go?
[01:46:37.825 --> 01:46:41.089]  Love you in the morning, love you in the evening, love you in the something time.
[01:46:41.089 --> 01:46:44.052]  I don't know.
[01:46:44.052 --> 01:46:44.632]  It doesn't matter.
[01:46:46.132 --> 01:46:50.855]  Alex, everything you just said was so racist, I just can't even believe it.
[01:47:13.683 --> 01:47:18.947]  This is InfoWarrior calling from Missouri with some truth bombs for the public.
[01:47:18.947 --> 01:47:24.492]  Everybody can look up Google.com and Google Costco, former CEO.
[01:47:24.492 --> 01:47:26.333]  That's all you have to do.
[01:47:26.333 --> 01:47:28.174]  And you'll get the backstory to this story.
[01:47:28.174 --> 01:47:28.635]  No, no, no.
[01:47:28.635 --> 01:47:33.539]  He ordered Dinesh D'Souza's book off the shelves, and I never even told this story.
[01:47:33.539 --> 01:47:35.400]  I was trying to do a distributorship deal.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:37.342]  This is what the Democrats do.
[01:47:37.342 --> 01:47:39.764]  About a year ago, and I was told in the meeting
[01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:45.445]  We're never going to put your coffee on our store shelves because you've talked bad about Costco.
[01:47:46.331 --> 01:48:04.847]  And I said, no, I haven't, don't remember doing that, but they said the date and what I had said about the CEO and the magazine I read from Costco, the free magazine they give out, about how wonderful Obama is and how wonderful socialism is, and literally that's how controlled they are.
[01:48:04.847 --> 01:48:10.132]  And that's the system they're going to have where you don't have a job unless you work for El Jefe.
[01:48:10.132 --> 01:48:11.313]  I mean, that's pretty scary, isn't it?
[01:48:12.449 --> 01:48:13.290]  It sure is.
[01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:18.353]  Well, I emailed the current Costco CEO, and I'm not going to name him, because he actually replied to me.
[01:48:18.353 --> 01:48:19.574]  I was shocked.
[01:48:19.574 --> 01:48:27.220]  But I got their little PR release a few minutes ago, and it's basically a big, pathetic denial that they pulled it off.
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:31.563]  Please stop sharing his book, because it didn't sell, even though it was a bestseller.
[01:48:32.717 --> 01:48:36.779]  In the middle of it, it says, Costco is not a bookstore.
[01:48:36.779 --> 01:48:39.820]  Our bookshelf space is very limited.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:51.746]  We exercise discipline in the best utilization of- We're actually psychopathic black-op commanders who put cancer viruses in the vaccine, and our life extension program for the Alpha Centauri's launch is on schedule.
[01:48:51.746 --> 01:48:54.127]  Oh, excuse me, I'm liberal.
[01:48:54.127 --> 01:48:56.688]  Oh, give me everything or you're racist.
[01:49:01.215 --> 01:49:01.715]  Racists!
[01:49:01.715 --> 01:49:02.216]  Racists!
[01:49:02.216 --> 01:49:02.396]  Racists!
[01:49:02.396 --> 01:49:02.756]  Racists!
[01:49:02.756 --> 01:49:03.297]  Racists!
[01:49:25.794 --> 01:49:26.615]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:49:26.615 --> 01:49:28.176]  CJ wants to say something.
[01:49:28.176 --> 01:49:34.641]  CJ said he went up there and there was a giant pyramid of Hillary's book that isn't selling well called I'm a Bloated Disease Maggot.
[01:49:34.641 --> 01:49:34.921]  Go ahead.
[01:49:34.921 --> 01:49:40.845]  Yeah, there was no copies of America, but Hillary's book was in a big old pile as big as Texas, untouched.
[01:49:40.845 --> 01:49:43.927]  No fingerprints on the covers, nothing.
[01:49:43.927 --> 01:49:46.549]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[01:49:46.549 --> 01:49:48.891]  There was a group of trendies dancing around it, chanting.
[01:49:48.891 --> 01:49:49.532]  You're kidding?
[01:49:49.532 --> 01:49:50.392]  No, I'm kidding.
[01:49:50.392 --> 01:49:50.552]  Yes.
[01:49:52.791 --> 01:49:53.492]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:49:53.492 --> 01:49:54.973]  Oh my gosh.
[01:49:54.973 --> 01:49:56.695]  Anything else, Eric?
[01:49:56.695 --> 01:50:02.001]  Yeah, I'll just say that as soon as I got the email, I just replied, pathetic.
[01:50:02.543 --> 01:50:04.104]  The guy wrote back.
[01:50:04.104 --> 01:50:04.905]  Oh, thank you.
[01:50:04.905 --> 01:50:06.486]  Sorry you fell that way and good luck.
[01:50:06.486 --> 01:50:08.408]  I was like, sorry G.I.
[01:50:08.408 --> 01:50:10.109]  We just come in peace.
[01:50:10.109 --> 01:50:11.711]  Lay down and take some shots.
[01:50:11.711 --> 01:50:12.892]  Drink some water.
[01:50:12.892 --> 01:50:14.893]  Feeling better now.
[01:50:14.893 --> 01:50:16.455]  The glands are shutting down.
[01:50:16.455 --> 01:50:19.977]  When your pancreatic cancer's going well.
[01:50:19.977 --> 01:50:20.798]  We're liberals.
[01:50:20.798 --> 01:50:21.859]  We're liberals.
[01:50:21.859 --> 01:50:24.201]  We're not psychopathic eugenicists or anything.
[01:50:24.201 --> 01:50:27.103]  I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[01:50:28.399 --> 01:50:43.554]  I said, hey, forward my email to Jim Senegal, your former CEO, who at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, the co-founder and former CEO of Costco, plugged President Barack Obama's investment in education and affordable energy, as well as his immigration policies.
[01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:46.578]  Barack Obama saved me!
[01:50:46.578 --> 01:50:49.399]  I'm Barack Obama!
[01:50:49.399 --> 01:50:52.060]  Thanks for raising taxes on poor people!
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:53.561]  You're so nice!
[01:50:53.561 --> 01:50:55.141]  Thanks for breaking all your promises!
[01:50:55.141 --> 01:50:57.182]  I feel so trendy right now!
[01:51:14.557 --> 01:51:16.900]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:52:06.855 --> 01:52:08.898]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[01:52:14.224 --> 01:52:19.048]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[01:52:19.048 --> 01:52:20.709]  There's only 500 of each.
[01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:24.892]  We're talking about Made in America belt buckles and nickel brass.
[01:52:24.892 --> 01:52:27.134]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[01:52:27.134 --> 01:52:30.036]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[01:52:30.256 --> 01:52:41.946]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.

[01:53:00.083 --> 01:53:01.684]  Time and time again.

[01:53:04.606 --> 01:53:06.047]  We need assistance.
[01:53:06.047 --> 01:53:06.867]  Please!
[01:53:06.867 --> 01:53:10.449]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[01:53:10.449 --> 01:53:14.151]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[01:53:14.151 --> 01:53:16.853]  While the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[01:53:16.853 --> 01:53:19.394]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[01:53:51.323 --> 01:53:55.706]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com
[01:54:18.797 --> 01:54:19.978]  Game over, man!
[01:54:19.978 --> 01:54:21.018]  Game over!
[01:54:21.018 --> 01:54:22.259]  Game over, man!
[01:54:22.259 --> 01:54:23.320]  Game over!
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.541]  Game over, man!
[01:54:24.541 --> 01:54:25.581]  Game over!
[01:54:25.581 --> 01:54:26.822]  Game over, man!
[01:54:26.822 --> 01:54:32.406]  Game over!
[01:54:32.406 --> 01:54:33.646]  Game over, man!
[01:54:33.646 --> 01:54:35.087]  Game over!
[01:54:35.087 --> 01:54:36.108]  That's what Obama thinks.
[01:54:36.108 --> 01:54:39.450]  He thinks Americans are done, and they sure like to act like it.
[01:54:39.450 --> 01:54:44.033]  Just like I told you, last year in Cyprus, they'd start taking everybody's bank accounts.
[01:54:44.033 --> 01:54:46.134]  Europe-wide, that's now beginning.
[01:54:46.134 --> 01:54:46.895]  Germany and England.
[01:54:48.985 --> 01:54:49.985]  The bureaucracy's doing it.
[01:54:49.985 --> 01:54:52.686]  They don't care what the elected governments do.
[01:54:52.686 --> 01:54:54.287]  Black ops squads are standing by.
[01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:55.887]  This is a takeover.
[01:54:55.887 --> 01:54:59.148]  George Soros is right up there at the top laughing the whole time.
[01:54:59.148 --> 01:55:05.390]  And now they're going to collapse the whole Southwest and bring us into depression and pose as the saviors over that because they don't care.
[01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:07.130]  And Obama doesn't care about being popular.
[01:55:07.130 --> 01:55:09.151]  He cares about getting his job done.
[01:55:09.151 --> 01:55:12.412]  We're going to your calls, but here's an article that was up on drogereport.com.
[01:55:13.732 --> 01:55:15.654]  It's from Infowars.com.
[01:55:15.654 --> 01:55:17.996]  Texas town, no quarter for illegals.
[01:55:17.996 --> 01:55:22.060]  They've passed a law saying they're not going to store them in government buildings there.
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:23.922]  Well, the Justice Department says that's not allowed.
[01:55:23.922 --> 01:55:26.744]  You will house them with your local tax money.
[01:55:26.744 --> 01:55:30.468]  And then the feds will give them the free welfare and the voting cards.
[01:55:30.468 --> 01:55:35.792]  But here's one of the videos with Houston residents freaking out about what's happening.
[01:55:35.792 --> 01:55:37.894]  Because Houston's probably already about 50% illegal.
[01:55:39.716 --> 01:55:42.438]  20% Hispanic, 30% Black, 10% White or something?
[01:55:42.438 --> 01:55:44.299]  I don't know.
[01:55:44.299 --> 01:55:44.359]  110%?
[01:55:44.359 --> 01:55:45.480]  I don't know.
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.941]  Let's go ahead and something like that.
[01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:50.923]  But let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:55:50.923 --> 01:55:57.547]  These illegal immigrants don't have nowhere to go, so y'all gonna come over here to our neighborhood, open the school up for them, really?
[01:55:58.857 --> 01:55:59.737]  Is that right?
[01:55:59.737 --> 01:56:00.238]  Now, wait a minute.
[01:56:00.238 --> 01:56:01.779]  Anybody think that's right?
[01:56:01.779 --> 01:56:04.780]  To say Bernadette Lancelin is angry would be an understatement.
[01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:05.220]  She's black, though.
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:11.203]  She can't... I'm sorry that the parents are in poor living conditions or surroundings or whatever's going on out there.
[01:56:11.203 --> 01:56:11.824]  I don't care.
[01:56:11.824 --> 01:56:12.604]  Why does she support Don Johnson?
[01:56:12.604 --> 01:56:15.926]  I care about what's going on right here in my own backyard, my neighborhood.
[01:56:16.306 --> 01:56:22.231]  Lancelin says she's raised three children and six grandchildren in the Trinity Garden neighborhood around Terrell Middle School.
[01:56:22.231 --> 01:56:34.681]  She made her feelings known as officials from FEMA, Health and Human Services, and the General Services Administration toured the building to determine whether it could be used as a temporary shelter for unaccompanied Central American children.
[01:56:34.681 --> 01:56:37.324]  Then they're borrowing money to open it up.
[01:56:37.324 --> 01:56:39.345]  Money that could be given to this school to open it up.
[01:56:39.345 --> 01:56:39.906]  That's enough.
[01:56:39.906 --> 01:56:40.426]  That's enough.
[01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:41.207]  I said I got calls.
[01:56:43.066 --> 01:56:44.667]  Full video on InfoWars.com.
[01:56:44.667 --> 01:56:46.327]  It's also on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:56:46.327 --> 01:56:47.448]  There's a bunch of videos.
[01:56:47.448 --> 01:56:48.428]  Listen, here's the deal, lady.
[01:56:48.428 --> 01:56:49.849]  You paid your tax money for that school.
[01:56:49.849 --> 01:56:50.969]  It isn't yours.
[01:56:50.969 --> 01:56:52.590]  It's the North American Union's.
[01:56:52.590 --> 01:56:56.852]  What's going to keep them from escaping here and just moving around?
[01:56:56.852 --> 01:56:58.113]  They're going to be released, lady.
[01:56:58.113 --> 01:56:58.773]  You didn't know that?
[01:56:58.773 --> 01:57:00.814]  What's going to keep them behind these gates?
[01:57:00.814 --> 01:57:01.874]  Security, really?
[01:57:01.874 --> 01:57:05.096]  They can't even control the border.
[01:57:05.096 --> 01:57:07.717]  Spoken like a true terrorist and a racist.
[01:57:07.717 --> 01:57:10.438]  You say 2 plus 2 equals 4, you're a terrorist.
[01:57:10.438 --> 01:57:12.439]  But there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:14.281 --> 01:57:15.722]  This is the total joke.
[01:57:15.722 --> 01:57:19.464]  And notice the reporter calls them unaccompanied children.
[01:57:19.464 --> 01:57:22.586]  Obama says, you will now call them unaccompanied children.
[01:57:22.586 --> 01:57:24.147]  Everyone goes and salutes.
[01:57:24.147 --> 01:57:26.289]  Yes, sir!
[01:57:26.289 --> 01:57:29.251]  I mean, you will not use the word bossy.
[01:57:29.251 --> 01:57:32.653]  I will not use the word bossy.
[01:57:32.653 --> 01:57:34.954]  I mean, this is a total joke.
[01:57:34.954 --> 01:57:36.155]  Game over, man.
[01:57:36.155 --> 01:57:38.096]  Game over.
[01:57:38.096 --> 01:57:39.938]  Derek in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:57:39.938 --> 01:57:40.338]  Go ahead.
[01:57:42.366 --> 01:57:43.227]  Hello?
[01:57:43.227 --> 01:57:45.128]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:57:45.128 --> 01:58:03.039]  Yes, I find it outrageous that abortion is somehow accepted as women's rights, and yet people who choose to home birth is condemned and the risk of CPS investigating them.
[01:58:03.039 --> 01:58:08.082]  Well, because they don't want the kid born, but then if it's born, they want to take it away and get it in the hands of the state.
[01:58:08.082 --> 01:58:08.982]  I mean, period.
[01:58:08.982 --> 01:58:11.404]  Good parents are the number one target of CPS on record.
[01:58:13.148 --> 01:58:16.633]  I mean, I see stories all the time where they know a kid's not getting fed, die, and they leave them there to die.
[01:58:16.633 --> 01:58:19.897]  But if it's a good Christian family, SWAT teams are coming.
[01:58:19.897 --> 01:58:20.478]  Anything else, sir?
[01:58:20.478 --> 01:58:20.738]  Go ahead.
[01:58:20.738 --> 01:58:21.199]  You've been holding.
[01:58:22.572 --> 01:58:32.659]  Um, no, just, just really witnessing this moral decline in this country where people don't, so many people don't stand for anything.
[01:58:32.659 --> 01:58:34.660]  Stay there, I'm gonna come back to you in one minute.
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:37.142]  You're absolutely right, more calls coming up in the next hour.
[01:58:37.142 --> 01:58:38.502]  It's more than moral decline.
[01:58:38.502 --> 01:58:40.324]  The people are jellyfish.
[01:58:40.324 --> 01:58:44.566]  They repeat what the national TV says, the local news repeats it.
[01:58:44.566 --> 01:58:48.389]  I mean, they have a saying 2 plus 2 equals 5 for us, this is a cult.
[01:58:50.109 --> 01:58:52.893]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[01:58:52.893 --> 01:58:57.559]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[01:58:57.559 --> 01:58:59.602]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[01:59:05.049 --> 01:59:05.769]  We're good to go.
[01:59:25.256 --> 01:59:32.818]  Five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[01:59:32.818 --> 01:59:36.699]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[01:59:36.699 --> 01:59:43.321]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[01:59:43.321 --> 01:59:48.383]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[01:59:52.958 --> 01:59:55.340]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.340 --> 02:00:06.047]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.047 --> 02:00:07.348]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.348 --> 02:00:09.129]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.129 --> 02:00:10.871]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.871 --> 02:00:12.452]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.452 --> 02:00:14.393]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.393 --> 02:00:18.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.216 --> 02:00:22.299]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.639 --> 02:00:31.542]  You know, I get really bummed out sometimes watching free society torn to pieces, watching criminality grow.
[02:00:31.542 --> 02:00:38.124]  Other times I get real cynical and sarcastic because I think about the morons that support all this corruption.
[02:00:38.124 --> 02:00:40.585]  They have no idea what they're doing.
[02:00:40.585 --> 02:00:44.286]  But the technocrats on top, dude, going back to Derrick in Ohio.
[02:00:44.286 --> 02:00:47.888]  Yeah, Derrick, I mean, it is a moral decline.
[02:00:47.888 --> 02:00:52.890]  And the big thing is the churches for 50 years have been state-run, the big churches, the Glitterbug churches.
[02:00:53.979 --> 02:01:03.262]  The CIA, with the name-it-and-claim-it fake right-wing churches out of Texas that went nationwide in the 70s and 80s, teach this prosperity message.
[02:01:03.262 --> 02:01:05.363]  They break up families, you name it.
[02:01:05.363 --> 02:01:08.284]  They're actually PSYOP officers, a lot of them.
[02:01:08.284 --> 02:01:09.925]  That's actually come out in the news before.
[02:01:11.273 --> 02:01:16.036]  But a lot of these big preachers in San Antonio and Houston are actually on the government payroll.
[02:01:16.036 --> 02:01:19.158]  And if people didn't know that, you just search engine clergy response teams.
[02:01:19.158 --> 02:01:24.762]  We broke it, but there's actually newscasts, and it was declassified seven years ago.
[02:01:24.762 --> 02:01:27.684]  In fact, not a lot of them, almost all of them are.
[02:01:27.684 --> 02:01:28.805]  And they get off on power trips.
[02:01:28.805 --> 02:01:30.446]  They go to meetings.
[02:01:30.446 --> 02:01:31.466]  They have ranks.
[02:01:31.466 --> 02:01:32.647]  They salute.
[02:01:32.647 --> 02:01:33.628]  The lower levels don't.
[02:01:33.628 --> 02:01:36.069]  They're just auxiliary spies.
[02:01:36.069 --> 02:01:36.990]  And they're bringing the country down.
[02:01:39.048 --> 02:01:43.171]  And that's why the Republicans won't do anything about the open border, because they're part of it as well.
[02:01:43.171 --> 02:01:55.799]  There's a rebellion by the Tea Party to try to fix it, but that's why they're going to just DEFCON 1 and just lowering the border completely, putting out the call as dozens of trains a day with thousands arrive.
[02:01:55.799 --> 02:02:01.583]  And they're going to bring them to every town, and then create a whole crisis out of that, and then exploit those people as well.
[02:02:01.583 --> 02:02:06.386]  So the poor people being brought in from the collapsed regimes are in the same boat as those of us here.
[02:02:06.386 --> 02:02:08.247]  But it doesn't matter, they're still being used as a weapon.
[02:02:10.134 --> 02:02:14.758]  It'd be kind of like in the Civil War, you know, you might be fighting your brother across the line.
[02:02:14.758 --> 02:02:19.223]  Still, they're being ordered and commanded to do things that will bring the country down.
[02:02:19.223 --> 02:02:24.668]  They are being politically programmed to vote to end the family, end the Second Amendment, end private property.
[02:02:24.668 --> 02:02:25.048]  It's here.
[02:02:25.048 --> 02:02:26.890]  They're going to take over.
[02:02:26.890 --> 02:02:29.713]  And they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on the Tea Party and come after us.
[02:02:29.713 --> 02:02:31.194]  I mean, that's what they're going to do.
[02:02:31.194 --> 02:02:34.077]  Now, we've got the boldness to know the enemy's plan.
[02:02:35.523 --> 02:02:43.129]  And it's so epic that we're aware of the enemy's operation, have accurately predicted their next moves, and now we can stop them.
[02:02:43.129 --> 02:02:46.532]  But people every day see me on the street and they say, thank you.
[02:02:46.532 --> 02:02:48.193]  We're glad you're there for us.
[02:02:48.193 --> 02:02:50.775]  Listen, brother, I'm here for me.
[02:02:50.775 --> 02:02:53.197]  If you're going to be free, I'm going to be free.
[02:02:53.197 --> 02:02:55.119]  Everything's connected.
[02:02:55.119 --> 02:02:58.141]  And I'm doing this for the future and for justice.
[02:02:58.141 --> 02:03:02.245]  And because I have fight and flight.
[02:03:02.245 --> 02:03:03.806]  And I never really run.
[02:03:03.806 --> 02:03:04.727]  I'm not very good at running.
[02:03:05.518 --> 02:03:07.920]  I just tend to always go into fight.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:11.843]  And so I'm doing it for you too, but buddy, I'm doing it for all of us.
[02:03:11.843 --> 02:03:14.345]  And I need you to get involved as well.
[02:03:14.345 --> 02:03:15.286]  I don't care what it is.
[02:03:15.286 --> 02:03:19.529]  You better just get moving.
[02:03:19.529 --> 02:03:20.470]  I mean, it's that simple.
[02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:21.811]  This is a takeover.
[02:03:21.811 --> 02:03:23.012]  And the globalists are organized.
[02:03:23.012 --> 02:03:25.974]  They got our tax money and they've got their commanders in place.
[02:03:30.933 --> 02:03:38.736]  I mean, Rodriguez is so arrogant on and off the air, where he admits he works for the government and will, you know, put out propaganda to open the borders and stuff.
[02:03:38.736 --> 02:03:40.557]  He's probably got a rank as well.
[02:03:40.557 --> 02:03:46.939]  I mean, they're trying to hire all the dentists I know, through my dad, to be in Homeland Security and spy on people, and not for terrorism.
[02:03:46.939 --> 02:03:48.480]  I mean, this is a takeover, folks.
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:50.241]  This is North Korea.
[02:03:50.241 --> 02:03:53.002]  Derek, would you like to say anything about that, or you got anything else you'd like to comment on?
[02:03:53.786 --> 02:04:05.247]  Well I'd like to say that my wife and I are having our first baby and we feel so blessed and we realize that there's nothing more important in our lives right now and I realize my time here
[02:04:06.561 --> 02:04:07.262]  It's only that.
[02:04:07.262 --> 02:04:08.523]  It's not forever.
[02:04:08.523 --> 02:04:18.531]  And we're only thinking of our children and our children's future and what kind of world that they're going to be brought up in and what's actually going to happen.
[02:04:18.531 --> 02:04:23.955]  This is just so crucial and to see so many people that
[02:04:24.575 --> 02:04:25.796]  They're not young people.
[02:04:25.796 --> 02:04:27.398]  They're not interested in having families.
[02:04:27.398 --> 02:04:29.340]  They're not interested in having children.
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:33.664]  They just want to stay children themselves forever, it seems.
[02:04:33.664 --> 02:04:43.433]  I'm not trying to generalize all people, of course, but it's really something that I notice, and God just help us all.
[02:04:47.901 --> 02:04:48.923]  Well said, sir.
[02:04:48.923 --> 02:04:50.645]  Very, very well said.
[02:04:50.645 --> 02:04:51.987]  And just stick together.
[02:04:51.987 --> 02:04:56.193]  I mean, they're trying to ban homeschooling in a whole bunch of states.
[02:04:56.193 --> 02:04:57.675]  Saying you'll get a CPS visit.
[02:04:57.675 --> 02:04:59.017]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:05:00.151 --> 02:05:05.133]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[02:05:05.133 --> 02:05:08.474]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:05:08.474 --> 02:05:10.575]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:05:10.575 --> 02:05:12.736]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:05:12.736 --> 02:05:14.377]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:05:14.377 --> 02:05:17.718]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:05:17.718 --> 02:05:19.298]  If so, consider this.
[02:05:19.298 --> 02:05:28.222]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:05:28.582 --> 02:05:34.965]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[02:05:34.965 --> 02:05:37.006]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[02:05:37.006 --> 02:05:44.629]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[02:05:53.736 --> 02:05:54.777]  Live Life Healthy!
[02:05:59.983 --> 02:06:07.152]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:06:07.152 --> 02:06:09.515]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:06:09.515 --> 02:06:14.781]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:06:14.781 --> 02:06:19.727]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:06:19.947 --> 02:06:23.270]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:27.334]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:06:27.334 --> 02:06:31.679]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:06:31.679 --> 02:06:41.888]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:06:41.888 --> 02:06:44.411]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:06:44.591 --> 02:06:52.824]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:06:52.824 --> 02:06:56.810]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.845]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:07:03.845 --> 02:07:05.086]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[02:07:05.086 --> 02:07:06.408]  God knows what's in this.
[02:07:06.408 --> 02:07:10.673]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:07:10.673 --> 02:07:16.581]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:07:16.581 --> 02:07:17.522]  That one is better.
[02:07:17.602 --> 02:07:18.862]  It tastes like nothing.
[02:07:18.862 --> 02:07:20.243]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:07:20.243 --> 02:07:20.943]  It's good water.
[02:07:20.943 --> 02:07:26.905]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:07:26.905 --> 02:07:34.148]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:07:34.148 --> 02:07:37.809]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:07:37.809 --> 02:07:44.772]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:07:44.912 --> 02:07:46.353]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:07:46.353 --> 02:07:47.153]  It's good water.
[02:07:47.153 --> 02:07:47.734]  Refreshing?
[02:07:47.734 --> 02:07:48.354]  It's good!

[02:07:55.398 --> 02:07:58.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's worse than I thought.
[02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:12.810]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:12.810 --> 02:08:23.635]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.635 --> 02:08:29.538]  Ladies and gentlemen, Carmageddon was supposed to happen out in L.A.
[02:08:29.538 --> 02:08:35.061]  a few years ago when they shut down one of the major highways for half a day to fix a bridge.
[02:08:35.061 --> 02:08:37.862]  No, ladies and gentlemen, Carmageddon
[02:08:39.426 --> 02:08:44.630]  Didn't happen in LA, it's happened here in Austin.
[02:08:44.630 --> 02:08:49.153]  Obama has been here since yesterday and there has been non-stop traffic.
[02:08:49.153 --> 02:08:51.234]  I-35 northbound, southbound blocked.
[02:08:51.234 --> 02:08:53.836]  Southbound this morning, northbound now.
[02:08:53.836 --> 02:09:04.984]  We had a guest that was going to be coming into studio and then a landline and can't even probably come on air because they can't get out of downtown because Obama was there this morning.
[02:09:05.836 --> 02:09:11.980]  The entire city is basically paralyzed with 20 miles of traffic backed up.
[02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:23.086]  We have a local news report here where he's out in Manor from about an hour ago with it backed up 20 miles into Austin.
[02:09:23.086 --> 02:09:25.207]  And by the way, this is right out by our office.
[02:09:25.207 --> 02:09:27.289]  We gotta go shoot video of this.
[02:09:27.289 --> 02:09:31.151]  20 miles of the traffic not moving.
[02:09:32.182 --> 02:09:44.735]  Yeah, Alex, the B-roll that we're showing is traffic heading out of Austin towards Manor, a suburb that is nowhere near metropolitan area as far as any of his planned visits.
[02:09:44.735 --> 02:09:46.157]  And look, the cops are all over.
[02:09:46.157 --> 02:09:48.059]  I saw this morning, he'd already left town.
[02:09:48.059 --> 02:09:53.344]  They were just randomly blocking mix masters and highways just as some act of power.
[02:09:54.355 --> 02:09:55.736]  And that's what all of this is.
[02:09:55.736 --> 02:09:59.197]  It's just a total domination of the American people.
[02:09:59.197 --> 02:10:02.859]  Let's play the audio from some of that newscast.
[02:10:02.859 --> 02:10:11.163]  And then I shot some video on my iPhone this morning of the traffic cams that they have where it just showed nothing moving on I-35 at 8 a.m.
[02:10:11.163 --> 02:10:12.183]  through 9.30 southbound.
[02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:27.133]  With them just blocking, waiting for him, and then when he goes through, like he's God, while he goes around fundraising.
[02:10:27.133 --> 02:10:30.935]  And again, it gets worse and worse and worse, but he won't go to the border.
[02:10:30.935 --> 02:10:32.015]  Let's go ahead and go to that report.
[02:10:33.171 --> 02:10:34.892]  Welcome back to KXAN News at Noon.
[02:10:34.892 --> 02:10:46.858]  We are taking a live picture of State Highway 71 and the Tollway 130 and the traffic back up there is a parking lot just outside of the airport near the Del Valle area.
[02:10:46.858 --> 02:10:51.780]  We assume this is the direction of the presidential motorcade, President Obama.
[02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:53.181]  Again, we've got a bunch of these videos.
[02:10:53.181 --> 02:10:53.921]  We've got new ones.
[02:10:53.921 --> 02:10:58.623]  We've got ones from when he was here a year ago, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:58.623 --> 02:11:01.665]  But again, I want to show the ones that I shot on my iPhone today.
[02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:08.632]  And again, we actually have video of that.
[02:11:08.632 --> 02:11:15.854]  And again, they literally shut down the highways to do this.
[02:11:15.854 --> 02:11:27.499]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to Joe Biggs reporting from Marietta, Southern California with Kit Daniels on what transpired last night.
[02:11:27.499 --> 02:11:28.259]  He got an interview.
[02:11:29.562 --> 02:11:39.105]  The video's up on Infowars.com with the hundreds of, quote, socialists that arrived demanding open borders.
[02:11:39.105 --> 02:11:50.108]  And again, we finally did get some shots up there showing the completely open highway for hours so that Obama could drive down.
[02:11:50.108 --> 02:11:58.050]  And again, even after he was gone, even after he had left and wasn't even in the city anymore,
[02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:03.922]  They still just kept it shut an hour later when I drove to work.
[02:12:03.922 --> 02:12:07.143]  I think they should permanently just close the road because he drove on it.
[02:12:07.143 --> 02:12:08.064]  I'm serious.
[02:12:08.064 --> 02:12:14.667]  Like they should take the wives of Viking kings and their children and burn them on a ship with his body?
[02:12:14.667 --> 02:12:17.948]  Why not blow the whole earth up just to honor Obama?
[02:12:17.948 --> 02:12:18.509]  I'm serious.
[02:12:19.795 --> 02:12:23.942]  How about some child sacrifice, like line the road with aborted babies?
[02:12:23.942 --> 02:12:25.784]  I mean, that's what they're into anyways.
[02:12:25.784 --> 02:12:29.490]  I guess they already heat hospitals with dead babies' bodies and Pepsi's baby-flavored.
[02:12:29.490 --> 02:12:30.251]  Why not?
[02:12:30.251 --> 02:12:34.939]  See, the maximum satire I can come up with, they're involved in.
[02:12:36.084 --> 02:12:53.239]  And then they have Democratic Party websites make fun of me for saying Caligula married his horse, and the elites become corrupt and decadent, knowing how ignorant their audience is, preying on the pseudo-fake bloated intellectuals who have five degrees and can't get jobs and are total failures and love it.
[02:12:57.586 --> 02:13:02.252]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Joe Biggs.
[02:13:02.252 --> 02:13:06.978]  I'm in a crazy mood today, folks, because I'm just so sick of it all, trying to control myself here.
[02:13:06.978 --> 02:13:11.543]  Trying to have gallows humor here as we watch the country hung until dead by the neck.
[02:13:11.543 --> 02:13:14.307]  Hung by the neck until dead, or flayed alive, or...
[02:13:15.782 --> 02:13:16.823]  Drawn and quartered.
[02:13:16.823 --> 02:13:17.964]  I've had enough, I tell you.
[02:13:17.964 --> 02:13:25.672]  Just having Obama and the globalists here in the city celebrating their destruction of Texas and America makes you want to throw up.
[02:13:25.672 --> 02:13:28.495]  Joe Biggs reporting from Southern California.
[02:13:28.495 --> 02:13:29.236]  What do you got for us?
[02:13:29.926 --> 02:13:40.951]  All right, I'm Joe Biggs here in Marietta, California, in front of the Border Patrol station, where just seconds ago, federal agents were flying overhead in the helicopter, just watching these peaceful protesters.
[02:13:40.951 --> 02:13:42.972]  They're circling around, trying to hassle us.
[02:13:42.972 --> 02:13:53.437]  Meanwhile, behind me, over this way, Border Patrol agents have been coming up to everybody that steps outside of the free speech zones, and they kind of push them back in their place and make sure that they stay over there.
[02:13:54.037 --> 02:13:56.539]  You know, this is complete tyranny at its best right now.
[02:13:56.539 --> 02:14:04.904]  You know, they've given us a small area to stand in, and if you try to step outside of that, they threaten you to call the cops and all that.
[02:14:04.904 --> 02:14:07.466]  What I saw last night was very interesting, though.
[02:14:07.466 --> 02:14:14.931]  Pro-amnesty supporters calling themselves a freedom socialist party, you know, supporting Obama's socialist agenda.
[02:14:18.146 --> 02:14:23.871]  Let's talk about the socialist Joe Biggs that you got an interview with.
[02:14:23.871 --> 02:14:25.112]  Let's talk about that.
[02:14:26.363 --> 02:14:28.925]  Yeah, they were all about leaving the borders completely open.
[02:14:28.925 --> 02:14:32.288]  When I asked the lady, should we have borders, she said no.
[02:14:32.288 --> 02:14:35.810]  It should just be one North American content completely.
[02:14:35.810 --> 02:14:39.433]  We should just let everybody roam freely through and do whatever they want.
[02:14:39.433 --> 02:14:49.621]  And then I asked her... Sure, Joe, we're going to have to abort this interview for a minute here because somebody's got a radio on or somebody's got another mic open there.
[02:14:49.621 --> 02:14:51.903]  And so we'll move to another spot.
[02:14:51.903 --> 02:14:53.865]  And then when we come back from break, you can
[02:14:54.545 --> 02:14:55.665]  We're about to get kicked off right now.
[02:14:55.665 --> 02:14:56.385]  This is going live.
[02:14:56.385 --> 02:14:56.806]  Okay, good.
[02:14:56.806 --> 02:14:57.886]  Well, let's talk to them then.
[02:14:57.886 --> 02:14:59.286]  Okay, well, let's go ahead.
[02:14:59.286 --> 02:15:03.487]  Oh, yeah, evil reporter terrorists aren't allowed to be in America, I guess.
[02:15:03.487 --> 02:15:04.988]  Look at them.
[02:15:04.988 --> 02:15:05.528]  Yes.
[02:15:05.528 --> 02:15:07.868]  Well, if you're an illegal alien, you'd be fine.
[02:15:07.868 --> 02:15:09.749]  Go over and talk to them.
[02:15:09.749 --> 02:15:11.969]  You want to come over?
[02:15:11.969 --> 02:15:13.270]  Go talk to them.
[02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:15.110]  Well, we'll talk.
[02:15:15.110 --> 02:15:18.231]  No, that's fine, if you don't mind.
[02:15:18.231 --> 02:15:19.431]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[02:15:19.431 --> 02:15:21.092]  How are you doing?
[02:15:21.092 --> 02:15:21.552]  What's the problem?
[02:15:22.589 --> 02:15:23.810]  I don't think there is a problem.
[02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:26.151]  Oh, I didn't know if there was something new.
[02:15:26.151 --> 02:15:29.733]  Did the Border Patrol Agents mention anything about going inside these cones to you?
[02:15:29.733 --> 02:15:31.734]  Um, yesterday the police came by.
[02:15:31.734 --> 02:15:36.116]  Someone from your police department said that this was a public road and we could actually be over here.
[02:15:36.116 --> 02:15:37.236]  I actually have that on tape.
[02:15:37.236 --> 02:15:38.197]  Okay.
[02:15:38.197 --> 02:15:43.699]  Well, I'm asking you that because the Border Patrol Agents mentioned to me that they don't want you behind these cones.
[02:15:43.699 --> 02:15:45.940]  I wasn't here yesterday, so I don't know.
[02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:47.741]  Why are they allowed to be over this way?
[02:15:47.741 --> 02:15:48.682]  I have no idea.
[02:15:48.682 --> 02:15:49.302]  That's what I was saying.
[02:15:49.302 --> 02:15:50.863]  Does Fox News pay them or something?
[02:15:50.863 --> 02:15:51.143]  I don't know.
[02:15:52.901 --> 02:16:01.867]  I mean, let me talk to the Border Patrol guy because obviously there's two... Well, Fox has got to be paying them or something if they can be over here because they're mainstream media and we can't be over there reporting for Americans.
[02:16:01.867 --> 02:16:05.069]  Look... Yeah, but I'm saying... No, exactly.
[02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:14.595]  Fox News is allowed to be there, but the cop came over to try to run the enemy, you know, the independent press off.
[02:16:14.595 --> 02:16:18.418]  And again, Joe, we're getting another audio feed from you.
[02:16:18.418 --> 02:16:20.039]  It's not even background people talking.
[02:16:21.616 --> 02:16:24.056]  And they told me yesterday too, if I have a press pass, I could be over here.
[02:16:25.287 --> 02:16:26.588]  Well, I mean, that's how this works.
[02:16:26.588 --> 02:16:27.849]  It's whatever they say.
[02:16:27.849 --> 02:16:29.950]  So, we're going to bust any legals.
[02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:31.191]  Ship them in.
[02:16:31.191 --> 02:16:32.192]  We expose it.
[02:16:32.192 --> 02:16:33.552]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:16:33.552 --> 02:16:35.134]  We're going to fund Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:35.134 --> 02:16:36.815]  We're going to ship narcotics in.
[02:16:36.815 --> 02:16:38.256]  We're going to launder drug money.
[02:16:38.256 --> 02:16:39.777]  We're going to buy armored vehicles.
[02:16:39.777 --> 02:16:41.398]  We're going to spy on you illegally.
[02:16:41.398 --> 02:16:44.820]  We're going to put microphones up all over the street corners and listen to you.
[02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:46.241]  We're going to take your money.
[02:16:46.241 --> 02:16:47.922]  We're going to bankrupt the country.
[02:16:47.922 --> 02:16:49.443]  We're going to ban your light bulbs.
[02:16:49.443 --> 02:16:51.064]  We say your kids belong to us.
[02:16:51.064 --> 02:16:52.425]  We say you didn't build your business.
[02:16:52.805 --> 02:16:54.847]  We'll walk somewhere else and call you back.
[02:16:54.847 --> 02:16:56.928]  I'm telling you this right now, I've personally spoken to them.
[02:17:22.203 --> 02:17:25.246]  Hello?
[02:17:25.246 --> 02:17:29.450]  Somebody else's mic is going into yours, but you're not going wireless, are you?
[02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:31.331]  Uh, yes, I'm wireless.
[02:17:31.331 --> 02:17:34.734]  Yeah, we always go with a cord.
[02:17:34.734 --> 02:17:37.436]  Number one rule is that we have a cord.
[02:17:37.436 --> 02:17:38.818]  Wireless always does this.
[02:17:38.818 --> 02:17:40.739]  It's a default position.
[02:17:40.739 --> 02:17:42.981]  But I know you guys are new, you're doing a great job.
[02:17:42.981 --> 02:17:45.844]  We're gonna go to cord, and then come back to you during the next break.
[02:17:47.744 --> 02:17:50.085]  Folks, this is total transparency.
[02:17:50.085 --> 02:17:50.946]  It's Mission Control.
[02:17:50.946 --> 02:17:52.887]  I'm directing it.
[02:17:52.887 --> 02:17:53.567]  It's the whole deal.
[02:17:53.567 --> 02:17:54.888]  I'm hearing the audio.
[02:17:54.888 --> 02:17:57.409]  I'm having to figure out what's going on.
[02:17:57.409 --> 02:18:01.671]  So we'll figure that out and go to a corded mic.
[02:18:01.671 --> 02:18:03.832]  Corded mic.
[02:18:03.832 --> 02:18:08.595]  We ran into this down at the border last time in Texas.
[02:18:08.595 --> 02:18:11.256]  But again, I could tell it was another broadcast.
[02:18:12.443 --> 02:18:17.125]  But what it was, was Fox or somebody had them on in a channel.
[02:18:17.125 --> 02:18:19.265]  Plus, they can jam those really easy.
[02:18:19.265 --> 02:18:25.467]  So, I tell you, boy, there is no talk radio like this by any stretch of the imagination, I can tell you right now.
[02:18:25.467 --> 02:18:29.209]  Also... I'll just talk about it during the break.
[02:18:30.568 --> 02:18:33.549]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:18:33.549 --> 02:18:43.973]  I would have loved for all you to really be able to hear what happened there with the cop, but we'll try to go back and talk to him again and see what's going on and see what's finding out, find out what we can.
[02:18:43.973 --> 02:18:49.855]  But basically they were like, you need to go ahead and move out of this area, but the corporate prostitutes could be there.
[02:18:49.855 --> 02:18:53.037]  At least Fox News is there reporting on what's going on, period.
[02:18:53.037 --> 02:18:55.658]  But again, we have the socialist video.
[02:18:56.898 --> 02:19:03.100]  That is just absolutely essential up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:06.602]  We're going to go to break and see if we can get audio with Joe Biggs down there.
[02:19:06.602 --> 02:19:11.023]  If not, just have him go HD, shoot video, file a report that way.
[02:19:11.023 --> 02:19:15.285]  And then we'll go to Oz, Ron, Tom, Stacy, and Louis.
[02:19:16.823 --> 02:19:23.167]  In fact, in order, we'll go to Oz, then we'll go to Ron, then we'll go to Stacey, Louis, and Tom.

[02:19:27.069 --> 02:19:30.591]  Some days it's a train wreck because it's real.
[02:19:30.591 --> 02:19:37.775]  Kind of like the train wrecked yesterday evening coming up with 1,300, looked more like 5,000 in the photos I saw.
[02:19:37.775 --> 02:19:39.056]  Illegals!
[02:19:39.056 --> 02:19:40.617]  Men, women, children, you name it.
[02:19:41.513 --> 02:19:45.335]  That we're not allowed to even call immigrants now, or migrants.
[02:19:45.335 --> 02:19:47.015]  First, don't call them illegal aliens.
[02:19:47.015 --> 02:19:48.416]  Then call them immigrants or migrants.
[02:19:48.416 --> 02:19:49.236]  No, no, no.
[02:19:49.236 --> 02:19:50.357]  They're all children.
[02:19:50.357 --> 02:19:55.059]  They can be a 55-year-old, three-time murderer, convicted child molester.
[02:19:55.059 --> 02:19:59.361]  You call them unaccompanied children, and the mainstream media jumps when they say do it.
[02:20:00.697 --> 02:20:01.477]  This is Dan Pilla.

[02:22:47.043 --> 02:22:50.505]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[02:22:50.505 --> 02:22:53.787]  I don't have to tell you, this economy sucks!
[02:22:53.787 --> 02:23:00.151]  Unlike the political elite and Wall Street bankers, you know that debts don't disappear and bailouts have big consequences.
[02:23:14.219 --> 02:23:21.023]  Stock and real estate market bubbles can pop at any moment and evaporate most or all of your retirement savings.
[02:23:21.023 --> 02:23:25.526]  Folks, we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse.
[02:23:25.526 --> 02:23:31.870]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:32.871]  And I'm here to tell you
[02:23:33.171 --> 02:23:38.873]  This may be the best thing that could happen to you if you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately.
[02:23:38.873 --> 02:23:44.696]  Proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[02:23:44.696 --> 02:23:46.756]  And history is about to repeat itself.

[02:24:03.117 --> 02:24:03.760]  We're good.
[02:24:25.939 --> 02:24:30.562]  Alright folks, that was deliberate jamming of our wireless signal.
[02:24:30.562 --> 02:24:35.704]  That's why I don't like using wireless out at those events because they can get messed up and people can dial into them.
[02:24:35.704 --> 02:24:39.947]  So we're going to get them hooked up with wires and go back to them coming up.
[02:24:39.947 --> 02:24:42.828]  Right now, let's go to Oz in Georgia.
[02:24:42.828 --> 02:24:44.369]  Oz, you're on the air.
[02:24:44.369 --> 02:24:45.250]  Thanks for calling in.
[02:24:45.250 --> 02:24:46.711]  Go ahead.
[02:24:46.711 --> 02:24:47.891]  How are you, Alex?
[02:24:47.891 --> 02:24:49.272]  This is the Red Alert.
[02:24:49.272 --> 02:24:51.953]  With your permission, I'd like to say a few words.
[02:24:51.953 --> 02:24:52.634]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[02:24:52.634 --> 02:24:53.634]  We don't really screen calls.
[02:24:53.634 --> 02:24:54.515]  You're on the air right now.
[02:24:55.083 --> 02:24:57.644]  Alright, thank you.
[02:24:57.644 --> 02:25:07.149]  Okay, well, the first thing I want to speak about is when Dinesh D'Souza said that Obama was really vindictive, he was not lying.
[02:25:07.149 --> 02:25:13.032]  Obama is someone that if you were to do something to him, he's going to do it to you tenfold.
[02:25:13.032 --> 02:25:24.098]  Now, I want to speak about the six American Islamist activists who work with the Obama administration that are Muslim Brotherhood operatives who enjoy strong influence over U.S.
[02:25:24.098 --> 02:25:24.478]  policy.
[02:25:26.457 --> 02:25:28.598]  That is what I want to speak about today.
[02:25:28.598 --> 02:25:33.742]  Brother, listen, this is a phenomenon with the callers where everybody always says what they want to speak about.
[02:25:33.742 --> 02:25:35.883]  You're on air now.
[02:25:35.883 --> 02:25:38.585]  So, so I'm not screening your call.
[02:25:38.585 --> 02:25:41.406]  We're live right now.
[02:25:41.406 --> 02:25:44.969]  Okay, then I want to know why nobody is doing anything about this.
[02:25:44.969 --> 02:25:48.731]  One of their main compounds is in is in Texas, Houston, Texas.
[02:25:49.594 --> 02:25:53.435]  And it is home to Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:53.435 --> 02:25:54.216]  No, no, that's true.
[02:25:54.216 --> 02:25:58.897]  They've got bases in California, Alabama, because the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:58.897 --> 02:26:00.037]  It's all a joke.
[02:26:00.037 --> 02:26:03.338]  It's all a scam.
[02:26:03.338 --> 02:26:14.562]  Well, exactly, but we have these people like Mohammed Ali Biari, who changed their accent up and sound just like a person from Houston, Texas, or from the South.
[02:26:14.562 --> 02:26:17.883]  And I think this is the same thing that we see with Obama, where he's trying to change
[02:26:18.938 --> 02:26:22.961]  Alex, would you mind if I say one more thing?
[02:26:22.961 --> 02:26:23.442]  Yeah, go ahead!
[02:26:47.518 --> 02:26:50.599]  Okay, I really need to say this.
[02:26:50.599 --> 02:26:52.099]  It seems like it's imaginary.
[02:26:52.099 --> 02:27:03.061]  It seems like it's made up by the CIA, FBI, but the thing that's going on here is that a lot of the CIA, FBI, NSA, all these federal agencies, they're converting to Islam.
[02:27:03.061 --> 02:27:10.063]  So not only are they hiring people from Hamas, people from these extremist groups,
[02:27:12.612 --> 02:27:14.133]  And I can tell you who's doing this.
[02:27:14.133 --> 02:27:16.875]  Janet Napolitano is hiring all these people.
[02:27:16.875 --> 02:27:18.996]  Obama is hiring all these people.
[02:27:18.996 --> 02:27:21.537]  And now they are enjoying influence over U.S.
[02:27:21.537 --> 02:27:21.917]  policy.
[02:27:25.765 --> 02:27:32.588]  Well, you know, I used to always hear that he was a secret Muslim and all that, and he went to Cairo and he spoke better Arabic, they said, than most Imams.
[02:27:32.588 --> 02:27:36.850]  And I don't just sit there and hate Muslims just because they're Muslims.
[02:27:36.850 --> 02:27:42.972]  There are super radical sects of it, and the globalists are the ones behind those, protecting them, arming them.
[02:27:42.972 --> 02:27:46.454]  And he gave them the missiles, he gave them the weapons, he let them attack all these countries.
[02:27:46.454 --> 02:27:51.556]  They tried to overthrow our ally, Egypt, and put the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda in charge.
[02:27:52.276 --> 02:27:57.401]  And our media called them protesters and they were launching rockets at police stations.
[02:27:57.401 --> 02:28:01.224]  And attacked the Egyptian military when they crushed them.
[02:28:01.224 --> 02:28:06.870]  And then his brother is a Muslim, excuse me, his cousin Odinga.
[02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:12.034]  And Odinga got caught shipping all this money up to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[02:28:12.034 --> 02:28:15.678]  And it's just a bunch of criminal groups and special interests
[02:28:16.914 --> 02:28:24.896]  And it's true that there is a radical Islamic special interest group working with the Democratic Party.
[02:28:24.896 --> 02:28:31.817]  And the Democrats, look what they're doing with LaRosa and Metcalfe, just any group they can to leverage a takeover.
[02:28:31.817 --> 02:28:38.439]  They'll work with Al-Qaeda, they'll work with big corporations, and the Republicans do it too.
[02:28:38.439 --> 02:28:40.759]  This is just a criminal takeover.
[02:28:40.759 --> 02:28:43.120]  Napoleon converted to Islam for a while.
[02:28:44.048 --> 02:28:46.389]  And got a bunch of the folks to work with him.
[02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:52.351]  I mean, this has happened before, and... Man, I just can't believe it.
[02:28:52.351 --> 02:28:59.294]  I mean, it's... I have reached a point that... This is so serious, I try to not get angry on air.
[02:28:59.294 --> 02:29:02.235]  So I try to be more cynical and make jokes out of this.
[02:29:02.235 --> 02:29:05.596]  Because... It's either that or cry.
[02:29:05.596 --> 02:29:10.558]  I mean, it's just... It's crazy!
[02:29:10.558 --> 02:29:11.338]  It's crazy!
[02:29:13.066 --> 02:29:23.131]  To then see Secret Service, when Obama's not even anywhere around, just driving around, bugging their eyes out at people in Austin, and acting rude to people.
[02:29:23.131 --> 02:29:24.251]  Because that's their job!
[02:29:24.251 --> 02:29:25.872]  Make us feel small!
[02:29:25.872 --> 02:29:27.432]  Grab our genitals at the airport!
[02:29:27.432 --> 02:29:29.153]  Treat us bad!
[02:29:29.153 --> 02:29:30.594]  Tell us we're the terrorists!
[02:29:30.594 --> 02:29:37.277]  I mean, they say Homeland Security is for gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians, conservatives.
[02:29:39.250 --> 02:29:40.091]  And they mean it.
[02:29:40.091 --> 02:29:42.254]  I mean, they're coming after us.
[02:29:42.254 --> 02:29:43.576]  If you're Al Qaeda, you're okay.
[02:29:43.576 --> 02:29:46.880]  If you have no job and you're from South America, come on in.
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:49.844]  If you're a big banker, you're tax exempt.
[02:29:49.844 --> 02:29:52.127]  We'll see if our guys got the audio fixed.
[02:29:52.127 --> 02:29:53.990]  Doing a great job down there on the border.
[02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:54.751]  Stay with us.
[02:30:00.208 --> 02:30:02.450]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:30:02.450 --> 02:30:10.519]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:30:10.519 --> 02:30:17.687]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:30:18.027 --> 02:30:22.631]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:30:22.631 --> 02:30:33.259]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:30:33.259 --> 02:30:39.764]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:32:00.484 --> 02:32:06.646]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:32:06.646 --> 02:32:11.208]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:32:11.208 --> 02:32:15.770]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:32:16.170 --> 02:32:19.113]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:32:19.113 --> 02:32:24.538]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:32:24.538 --> 02:32:31.944]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[02:32:31.944 --> 02:32:36.088]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:32:36.088 --> 02:32:40.872]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:41.172 --> 02:32:49.639]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:32:49.639 --> 02:32:54.062]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:54.062 --> 02:32:59.507]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:14.508]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:14.508 --> 02:33:17.769]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.769 --> 02:33:23.790]  The video is not that good for radio, but it's very powerful if you see the video.
[02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:27.131]  It's in the featured news section of InfoWars.com.
[02:33:27.131 --> 02:33:31.092]  Pro-amnesty socialists flood Marietta City Hall.
[02:33:31.092 --> 02:33:37.874]  Amnesty activists hold signs stating, Open the Borders, Freedom Socialist Party and Immigrants Welcome Here.
[02:33:39.352 --> 02:33:43.454]  Again, to be voters who bring in pure socialism, aka Cloward and Piven.
[02:33:43.454 --> 02:33:44.935]  And they admit that on tape.
[02:33:44.935 --> 02:33:51.758]  So great job to Kit Daniels and Staff Sergeant Joe Briggs down there on the border in Marietta.
[02:33:51.758 --> 02:33:55.180]  And they're coming back today, or I guess in the morning.
[02:33:55.180 --> 02:33:59.001]  And they've got a lot of HD footage that's now up on Infowars.com.
[02:33:59.001 --> 02:34:01.863]  They're able to get more of it filed by the Nightly News 7 o'clock each night.
[02:34:02.723 --> 02:34:14.636]  And again, I thought it was just wireless chatter over the deal, but it was actual broadcasting over the channel we were on out there in Marietta.
[02:34:14.636 --> 02:34:16.758]  So we've got them with a wired-in mic now.
[02:34:16.758 --> 02:34:18.200]  There's a lot of bullhorning going on.
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:19.702]  The police are there.
[02:34:19.702 --> 02:34:23.225]  But Joe, I couldn't make it all out when you were talking to the senior police officer.
[02:34:24.868 --> 02:34:28.034]  Was that a Marietta police officer or a county sheriff?
[02:34:28.034 --> 02:34:30.800]  And it sounded to me like he said, get out of there.
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:34.607]  But you said, hey, you know, you've got Fox News right there.
[02:34:34.607 --> 02:34:35.308]  What are you saying?
[02:34:36.553 --> 02:34:37.393]  Roger that.
[02:34:37.393 --> 02:34:40.514]  It was a Marietta Police Department officer.
[02:34:40.514 --> 02:34:42.395]  And he came over and said, no, you can't be over here.
[02:34:42.395 --> 02:34:44.396]  You're standing on the wrong side of the cones.
[02:34:44.396 --> 02:34:46.817]  The Border Patrol asked you to leave.
[02:34:46.817 --> 02:34:48.857]  But standing right behind me is Fox News.
[02:34:48.857 --> 02:34:55.480]  I said, well, if Fox News can be over there, the mainstream media, the ones who don't even tell the truth, why can they be over there?
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:34:57.060]  They must be paying off the Border Patrol.
[02:34:57.060 --> 02:34:58.661]  They must be paying off the police.
[02:34:58.661 --> 02:35:01.942]  I mean, just seconds ago after, I was told I couldn't be here.
[02:35:02.941 --> 02:35:08.625]  A Fox News cameraman was standing right over here, outside of the coned area where I was just told I could not be.
[02:35:08.625 --> 02:35:11.107]  And the Border Patrol didn't even go over and say anything to him.
[02:35:11.107 --> 02:35:12.128]  That's what's going on.
[02:35:12.128 --> 02:35:13.449]  This is tyranny at its best.
[02:35:13.449 --> 02:35:16.171]  Well, it's no longer the Border Patrol or ICE or Homeland Security.
[02:35:16.171 --> 02:35:19.553]  It's the Department of Illegal Alien Importation.
[02:35:19.553 --> 02:35:22.896]  And I'm seeing the photos and videos of these trains.
[02:35:22.896 --> 02:35:24.357]  Most of these are adult men.
[02:35:25.197 --> 02:35:39.402]  These are not children, but the media says you will call them unaccompanied children, and then all the prostitute media that works for the government, who's allowed to be there, but we aren't, they all dutifully do whatever the globalists tell them to do.
[02:35:39.402 --> 02:35:40.542]  This is just amazing, Joe.
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:42.581]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:35:42.581 --> 02:35:57.512]  And last night, though, too, you know, with the whole, the pro-amnesty side, with the socialist flags flying and all that, they said everybody that was on our side over here, on the pro, you know, or the anti-illegal immigrant side, they were calling us all terrorists, bigots, that we were, uh...
[02:35:58.212 --> 02:36:01.853]  Basically unwelcomed and we should not be out here doing this.
[02:36:01.853 --> 02:36:09.395]  They want the borders to be completely wide open and they just want to make one huge North American content with no borders whatsoever.
[02:36:09.395 --> 02:36:14.117]  And by the way, that's the North American Union plan that Petraeus and Pelosi talked about.
[02:36:14.117 --> 02:36:16.977]  We're still not going to be allowed into Mexico.
[02:36:16.977 --> 02:36:20.238]  It's only we're open and then we've got to pay the bills.
[02:36:20.238 --> 02:36:21.679]  You understand that?
[02:36:21.679 --> 02:36:22.199]  Yes, I mean,
[02:36:23.602 --> 02:36:29.886]  What's going on out here is crazy, but I mean, the positive side of this is, you know, we're standing out here waiting on a bus.
[02:36:29.886 --> 02:36:31.307]  A bus hasn't happened.
[02:36:31.307 --> 02:36:35.570]  You know, what that tells me is a city like Murrieta stood up to the tyranny.
[02:36:35.570 --> 02:36:39.072]  They stood up to the government and said, no, you're not going to come in here.
[02:36:39.072 --> 02:36:42.454]  And they scared these guys and they're not willing to come down here right now at all.
[02:36:43.311 --> 02:36:44.413]  Well, it's amazing.
[02:36:44.413 --> 02:36:47.197]  You know, that officer's body language was he didn't dislike you.
[02:36:47.197 --> 02:36:53.345]  He was being ordered to come over and try to tell you to get out of that area because the Border Patrol wanted you to.
[02:36:54.335 --> 02:36:59.480]  Yesterday the police department came over here directly in the spot where I'm standing and they said you can be here.
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:04.165]  If you have press credentials you can be here and you can be across the street right over there where I was just standing.
[02:37:04.165 --> 02:37:07.168]  They said that is a public area on the right side of the road.
[02:37:07.168 --> 02:37:09.630]  The border patrol side is on the left side.
[02:37:09.630 --> 02:37:11.011]  So the police department told us that.
[02:37:11.011 --> 02:37:17.558]  So the border patrol, the government, is bullying the local police department and telling them how they can run their jurisdiction.
[02:37:18.237 --> 02:37:26.183]  Well the truth is you should be able to be anywhere as long as it's not on private property and all those right-of-ways are public under common law.
[02:37:26.183 --> 02:37:33.068]  First they say just get in these boxes, then phase two they say now get back in a smaller box, and finally they say leave.
[02:37:33.068 --> 02:37:35.169]  They're training you to go under their control.
[02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:43.433]  And again, if you want to, I think you should go over there and talk to them and say, is this public right-of-way?
[02:37:43.433 --> 02:37:46.714]  Is this the county or city of Marietta?
[02:37:46.714 --> 02:37:53.056]  Because I know the city has come out and said the feds aren't helping them, they can't take all these illegals, and the rest of it.
[02:37:54.249 --> 02:38:06.059]  Well, I mean, right over here behind us was another area where they were allowing parking over here and then they blocked it off and made this area that they were going to call a like a police police command center.
[02:38:06.059 --> 02:38:08.781]  But there's nobody even here from the police station for that.
[02:38:08.781 --> 02:38:09.642]  They're just trying to keep.
[02:38:10.242 --> 02:38:13.123]  The free speech zone, smaller and smaller.
[02:38:13.123 --> 02:38:21.205]  You know, every time we go to one of these events, they get smaller and smaller and smaller, and this is like a tiny box we're able to stand in to be able to voice our opinions here.
[02:38:21.205 --> 02:38:27.267]  Yeah, well you do what you feel is best, but I personally would go and challenge it and walk around when they come over and flip out.
[02:38:27.267 --> 02:38:28.867]  I'd say, come on man, this is America.
[02:38:28.867 --> 02:38:31.348]  You're busing illegal aliens in here.
[02:38:32.168 --> 02:38:34.229]  Committing federal crime.
[02:38:34.229 --> 02:38:35.770]  We're here to expose this cover-up.
[02:38:35.770 --> 02:38:37.031]  What do you expect us to do?
[02:38:37.031 --> 02:38:40.653]  I notice Fox News is supposedly allowed to be on the other side of the street.
[02:38:40.653 --> 02:38:41.573]  What do you want to do, Joe?
[02:38:41.573 --> 02:38:42.473]  Okay, Joe Biggs.
[02:38:42.473 --> 02:38:43.794]  I'm saying let's go do it.
[02:38:43.794 --> 02:38:44.795]  Why not?
[02:38:44.795 --> 02:38:49.297]  Oh, how dare an American walk where illegals are about to be bussed in.
[02:38:49.297 --> 02:38:50.718]  Again, we're not against these kids.
[02:38:50.718 --> 02:38:56.741]  I kind of agree with Glenn Beck that it is good to be nice to them giving soccer balls to teddy bears because they're leaving collapsed areas.
[02:38:56.741 --> 02:39:00.283]  But they're being used as weaponized tools politically in the middle.
[02:39:02.227 --> 02:39:03.689]  Do what?
[02:39:03.689 --> 02:39:04.070]  Anybody?
[02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.430]  You, sir.
[02:39:04.430 --> 02:39:05.912]  That's fine.
[02:39:05.912 --> 02:39:10.039]  Okay, how about you?
[02:39:10.039 --> 02:39:11.501]  That's America right there.
[02:39:11.501 --> 02:39:14.465]  Just walk on over there.
[02:39:14.465 --> 02:39:15.146]  Okay, yeah, sure.
[02:39:15.146 --> 02:39:16.268]  Please have somebody out here.
[02:39:18.772 --> 02:39:20.695]  They're refusing to talk, they said they'll get someone else right now.
[02:39:20.695 --> 02:39:22.117]  Where are they standing, Joe?
[02:39:22.117 --> 02:39:22.778]  Where are they standing?
[02:39:22.778 --> 02:39:28.446]  So why is it, I have a question though, why could Fox News bring their cameras over here a minute ago for five minutes after I was told I couldn't be here?
[02:39:28.446 --> 02:39:30.729]  Just walk up to them, Joe.
[02:39:30.729 --> 02:39:32.512]  And not one of you guys walked over and told them to leave.
[02:39:32.512 --> 02:39:34.915]  Close the distance before the cop gets there.
[02:39:34.915 --> 02:39:35.196]  Do what?
[02:39:37.213 --> 02:39:38.754]  I mean, that's not Mexico or Border Patrol.
[02:39:38.754 --> 02:39:39.674]  That's a county road.
[02:39:39.674 --> 02:39:40.874]  I would just go talk to them.
[02:39:40.874 --> 02:39:41.294]  That's a county road.
[02:39:41.294 --> 02:39:44.376]  That's all we were saying is why was Fox News allowed to sit over there?
[02:39:44.376 --> 02:39:45.376]  We were told we had to leave.
[02:39:45.376 --> 02:39:45.756]  Well, no.
[02:39:45.756 --> 02:39:47.337]  Why are citizens, period?
[02:39:47.337 --> 02:39:49.798]  Why are citizens, period, treated like crap?
[02:39:49.798 --> 02:39:52.198]  Tell them you want an air-conditioned bus to give you a ride back to Austin.
[02:39:52.198 --> 02:39:53.359]  I want an air-conditioned box in there.
[02:39:53.359 --> 02:39:54.239]  I want some free food.
[02:39:54.239 --> 02:39:54.959]  Can I get a health care?
[02:39:54.959 --> 02:39:55.900]  I'm a veteran.
[02:39:55.900 --> 02:39:59.481]  I haven't been seen in five months.
[02:39:59.481 --> 02:40:01.882]  Can you guys do anything for us, please?
[02:40:01.882 --> 02:40:02.222]  That's right.
[02:40:02.222 --> 02:40:04.443]  He coughs up blood every day, but he can't get into the VA.
[02:40:05.399 --> 02:40:07.700]  I can't get into VA, but they're in there hanging out.
[02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:09.421]  That's ridiculous.
[02:40:09.421 --> 02:40:10.942]  Where does this country come to?
[02:40:10.942 --> 02:40:14.744]  By the way, have they still canceled your VA check since you went on the base?
[02:40:14.744 --> 02:40:19.947]  Yeah, I haven't gotten anything yet.
[02:40:19.947 --> 02:40:23.329]  Okay, they're going to try to call the police again and do what they do because they're sheep.
[02:40:23.329 --> 02:40:24.169]  Well, just listen.
[02:40:24.169 --> 02:40:25.550]  That's a county road right there, right?
[02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:26.951]  Go over and talk to them.
[02:40:26.951 --> 02:40:28.712]  Yeah, it's a county road.
[02:40:28.712 --> 02:40:30.633]  Go over and talk to them.
[02:40:30.633 --> 02:40:32.974]  Again, live from Marietta, California with Joe Biggs.
[02:40:32.974 --> 02:40:34.035]  This is not a public road.
[02:40:37.543 --> 02:40:39.865]  Is this not a public road to walk on?
[02:40:39.865 --> 02:40:46.171]  Yeah, we need to get the demonstrators over there to talk to everybody and just discuss this and not be put in smaller and smaller boxes.
[02:40:46.171 --> 02:40:47.793]  Go talk to that border patrol.
[02:40:47.793 --> 02:40:48.874]  Let's go find out what's going on.
[02:40:48.874 --> 02:40:54.559]  That lady's talking to them.
[02:40:54.559 --> 02:40:56.461]  Okay, but what's the problem though is what I don't understand.
[02:40:59.858 --> 02:41:00.858]  I know, but that's a problem.
[02:41:00.858 --> 02:41:06.580]  When you follow orders and you don't follow your heart, and you're not an American, and you don't go by that, then that's what tyranny takes over.
[02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:08.840]  Ask him how long ago Obama ordered the stand-down.
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:10.201]  Anybody can take over.
[02:41:10.201 --> 02:41:11.201]  Anybody can take orders.
[02:41:11.201 --> 02:41:14.362]  Ask him how long ago Obama ordered the stand-down.
[02:41:14.362 --> 02:41:16.723]  How long ago did Obama order the stand-down?
[02:41:16.723 --> 02:41:18.223]  When did Obama order the stand-down?
[02:41:18.223 --> 02:41:22.344]  No, no.
[02:41:22.344 --> 02:41:22.744]  Talk to him.
[02:41:22.744 --> 02:41:26.285]  Talk to him.
[02:41:26.285 --> 02:41:26.685]  No, no.
[02:41:26.685 --> 02:41:29.106]  Ask him if that's a county road or border patrol jurisdiction.
[02:41:31.282 --> 02:41:32.323]  They're only at the border.
[02:41:32.323 --> 02:41:39.946]  They're just in a power grab, getting more parts of the country as an internal checkpoint.
[02:41:39.946 --> 02:41:47.149]  Again, if you just joined us, our reporters are in Southern California in Marietta, and they're just... How far away are you from the border?
[02:41:47.149 --> 02:41:49.310]  That's the fence right there, correct?
[02:41:49.310 --> 02:41:49.930]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:41:49.930 --> 02:41:51.891]  We're pretty far away from the border.
[02:41:51.891 --> 02:41:55.252]  This is maybe 120 miles.
[02:41:56.857 --> 02:42:00.120]  Yeah, that's what I thought looking at the map, so I don't understand why the Border Patrol is there.
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:01.421]  Well, they have a big fence.
[02:42:01.421 --> 02:42:03.703]  If we have a fence across our border, it's racist.
[02:42:03.703 --> 02:42:05.264]  But it's okay for them to have their fence.
[02:42:05.264 --> 02:42:07.826]  It's okay for the White House to have a fence around that.
[02:42:07.826 --> 02:42:09.407]  But wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:42:09.407 --> 02:42:10.128]  That's right.
[02:42:10.128 --> 02:42:14.571]  I mean, they're dumping the people there in Marietta that's a ways from the border.
[02:42:14.571 --> 02:42:16.173]  And then why is the Border Patrol there?
[02:42:16.173 --> 02:42:16.953]  It just clicked.
[02:42:17.876 --> 02:42:21.558]  Their Constitution-free zone is only 100 miles from the border.
[02:42:21.558 --> 02:42:27.881]  I would go ask them, what are you doing away from the border stopping citizens from reporting on illegals being bust in?
[02:42:27.881 --> 02:42:32.004]  They literally are the immigrant importation agency.
[02:42:32.004 --> 02:42:34.305]  Why are you guys keeping us from doing our job to report on this?
[02:42:34.305 --> 02:42:36.566]  All we're trying to do is get the facts.
[02:42:36.566 --> 02:42:37.427]  Hello?
[02:42:37.427 --> 02:42:40.448]  Back out from Marietta so people can see the map.
[02:42:40.448 --> 02:42:41.829]  This is unbelievable.
[02:42:41.829 --> 02:42:42.829]  People don't, they don't care.
[02:42:50.311 --> 02:42:51.992]  And the police are now pulling up.
[02:42:51.992 --> 02:42:53.252]  There's two police SUVs coming.
[02:42:53.252 --> 02:42:54.093]  Alright, we'll talk to them.
[02:42:54.093 --> 02:43:02.416]  Ask them why the Border Patrol is 100 miles from the border telling you that the press can't walk around on the side of the road in a county.
[02:43:02.416 --> 02:43:04.497]  Go up and see what they're talking about over there.
[02:43:04.497 --> 02:43:05.677]  Let's go find out.
[02:43:05.677 --> 02:43:07.898]  Go ask the cop what's going on.
[02:43:07.898 --> 02:43:08.258]  No!
[02:43:08.258 --> 02:43:10.739]  It's alright, we have the right to record.
[02:43:10.739 --> 02:43:12.360]  We have the right to record.
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:15.581]  But all I'm saying is there's been people walking over here and talking to you guys, so why can't we?
[02:43:15.581 --> 02:43:16.982]  Because we're not on camera right now.
[02:43:17.473 --> 02:43:19.534]  Ask him why he's 100 miles from the border.
[02:43:19.534 --> 02:43:22.816]  Why are you guys 100 miles from the border?
[02:43:22.816 --> 02:43:25.258]  To protect illegals.
[02:43:25.258 --> 02:43:26.279]  From my job.
[02:43:26.279 --> 02:43:27.519]  It's called the First Amendment.
[02:43:27.519 --> 02:43:28.420]  From Austin, Texas.
[02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:31.962]  From Infowars.com.
[02:43:31.962 --> 02:43:35.604]  Yes.
[02:43:35.604 --> 02:43:40.047]  No, the thing is those people keep coming over and after you guys told us we had to move, Fox News moved their camera.
[02:43:42.113 --> 02:43:46.735]  Listen, why is the Border Patrol 100 miles from the border shepherding illegals?
[02:43:46.735 --> 02:43:50.998]  The police officers came over yesterday, that's all I was saying.
[02:43:50.998 --> 02:43:52.819]  They're there to cover up a crime, bring that up.
[02:43:52.819 --> 02:43:58.322]  Why is the Border Patrol 100 miles away... Impeding immigration!
[02:43:58.322 --> 02:43:59.162]  Importing them!
[02:43:59.162 --> 02:44:06.406]  You guys are impeding immigration!
[02:44:06.406 --> 02:44:09.988]  We can't talk to the ICE at all, any ICE officials whatsoever, you guys put them on furlough.
[02:44:11.499 --> 02:44:15.203]  Tell him he's stonewalling while helping smuggle humans.
[02:44:15.203 --> 02:44:17.566]  You guys are stonewalling while helping smuggle humans.
[02:44:17.566 --> 02:44:21.330]  That guy has no jurisdiction.
[02:44:21.330 --> 02:44:22.651]  Tell the cop to come over.
[02:44:22.651 --> 02:44:26.255]  That guy, that border patrol is involved in treason.
[02:44:26.255 --> 02:44:28.538]  Isn't this, isn't this public properly over here?
[02:44:28.538 --> 02:44:30.700]  Hey, go over to the sidewalk.
[02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:31.441]  Go to the sidewalk.
[02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:34.782]  The cops know it's all color law.
[02:44:34.782 --> 02:44:35.803]  Go to the cops over there.
[02:44:35.803 --> 02:44:39.387]  Go talk to that cop and ask why- Can I talk to you real quick, please, sir?
[02:44:39.387 --> 02:44:40.148]  Look at this.
[02:44:40.148 --> 02:44:45.294]  We're just trying to find out why yesterday we were told we could stand over here, and then today they're flipping out on us.
[02:44:45.294 --> 02:44:46.555]  That's what we're trying to figure out.
[02:44:46.555 --> 02:44:49.419]  We're just standing over here being nice- They think you stole their property, sir.
[02:44:49.419 --> 02:44:51.821]  I thought- We were told yesterday that- No, that's right away.
[02:44:51.821 --> 02:44:52.903]  That is not their property.
[02:44:54.821 --> 02:44:56.722]  Can you not put the camera on me?
[02:44:56.722 --> 02:44:59.244]  God, they're all working for the system!
[02:44:59.244 --> 02:45:01.566]  All the aid and abet shipping the illegals in.
[02:45:01.566 --> 02:45:03.748]  It's not an interview, it's just a conversation.
[02:45:03.748 --> 02:45:06.370]  Alright, go to the sidewalk.
[02:45:06.370 --> 02:45:09.772]  Go where they're at over there!
[02:45:09.772 --> 02:45:11.233]  This is unbelievable.
[02:45:11.233 --> 02:45:12.554]  And now they're wandering around.
[02:45:12.554 --> 02:45:14.276]  Look at her, she's there aiding and abetting this.
[02:45:18.658 --> 02:45:22.841]  So we're just trying to figure out, because we were given different information yesterday, and that's what I've been trying to find out.
[02:45:22.841 --> 02:45:23.862]  They just keep stonewalling me.
[02:45:23.862 --> 02:45:25.163]  They won't answer my question.
[02:45:25.163 --> 02:45:33.770]  Yesterday, an officer from your police, they came over here and stopped and talked to us and said, this was an open area.
[02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:40.335]  You could be over here and sit down, have chairs and talk and interview and protest on this side of the road.
[02:45:40.335 --> 02:45:41.136]  We have that on film.
[02:45:43.186 --> 02:45:47.009]  Ask him why the Border Patrol's out of their jurisdiction harassing citizens.
[02:45:47.009 --> 02:45:51.172]  Okay, why can't we be over here today when yesterday you said we could?
[02:45:51.172 --> 02:45:52.833]  Well, I don't know what's changed.
[02:45:52.833 --> 02:46:01.780]  So, all I'm asking you here today, while I'm here, is to please come out... Ask him why the Border Patrol is policing citizens.
[02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:05.263]  ...some private property rights on the Border Patrol's area.
[02:46:05.263 --> 02:46:06.964]  Why is the Border Patrol policing citizens?
[02:46:10.107 --> 02:46:11.288]  That's your guys' job!
[02:46:11.288 --> 02:46:14.370]  Why are the Border Patrol policing citizens?
[02:46:14.370 --> 02:46:15.171]  Can I stand right here?
[02:46:15.171 --> 02:46:15.711]  No, you're not!
[02:46:15.711 --> 02:46:16.972]  You're violating our rights, lady!
[02:46:16.972 --> 02:46:17.893]  But why I'm saying why is Fox here?
[02:46:17.893 --> 02:46:18.553]  Is Fox paying you guys?
[02:46:18.553 --> 02:46:20.094]  Does Fox News pay all of you so they can use that?
[02:46:34.815 --> 02:46:36.236]  Yeah, go over to Fox.
[02:46:36.236 --> 02:46:37.317]  Go to the Fox satellite.
[02:46:37.317 --> 02:46:39.158]  No, no, it's not that.
[02:46:39.158 --> 02:46:41.800]  We just want to get a good, uh, an answer.
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:42.140]  That's all.
[02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:43.260]  I just gave you an answer.
[02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:44.241]  But that's not what we were told.
[02:46:44.241 --> 02:46:47.803]  You're aiding and abetting the importation of illegals.
[02:46:47.803 --> 02:46:50.185]  It should be the same standard all the time.
[02:46:50.185 --> 02:46:51.186]  Go to the Fox satellite.
[02:46:51.186 --> 02:46:51.546]  That's fine.
[02:46:53.681 --> 02:46:56.022]  No, no, not the other side.
[02:46:56.022 --> 02:46:58.302]  Go where Fox is at with the satellite dish.
[02:46:58.302 --> 02:47:00.823]  Because they'll have to make them move too.
[02:47:00.823 --> 02:47:09.965]  Again, folks, this is cops following criminal orders to violate the First Amendment to then aid and abet the fraud of bringing illegals over.
[02:47:09.965 --> 02:47:11.225]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:11.225 --> 02:47:14.786]  We're right here, outside the cones.
[02:47:14.786 --> 02:47:18.827]  Now Fox will try to get you, if they follow the pattern, to have the cops throw you out of there as well.
[02:47:20.683 --> 02:47:24.405]  Joe, I don't mean to be ranting here, but I mean, break down what just happened.
[02:47:24.405 --> 02:47:27.006]  You're, you're, you're, you're... How many miles away from the border?
[02:47:27.006 --> 02:47:27.026]  120.
[02:47:27.026 --> 02:47:30.888]  120 miles from the border.
[02:47:30.888 --> 02:47:36.010]  And the Border Patrol is there to keep the press away from the illegals.
[02:47:36.010 --> 02:47:40.832]  It's 10 times more guarded than our borders are.
[02:47:40.832 --> 02:47:46.455]  Well, no, that's their job, is to guard the illegal transfer and the human trafficking.
[02:47:46.455 --> 02:47:48.716]  It's government-sponsored human trafficking at its best.
[02:47:50.370 --> 02:47:51.050]  Give us a report.
[02:47:51.050 --> 02:47:53.211]  Talk about what just happened.
[02:47:53.211 --> 02:47:59.353]  What happened was, is we walked and we stood and we're talking where we were told to yesterday by the local police.
[02:47:59.353 --> 02:48:02.134]  And then Border Patrol came over and said, oh, you can't be here.
[02:48:02.134 --> 02:48:03.714]  Well, that's not their jurisdiction.
[02:48:03.714 --> 02:48:05.555]  This is the public property area.
[02:48:05.555 --> 02:48:07.455]  This is the city's area right here.
[02:48:07.455 --> 02:48:07.895]  Right away.
[02:48:07.895 --> 02:48:09.176]  They're just trying to bully us around.
[02:48:09.176 --> 02:48:12.997]  It's only a matter of seconds before the brown shirts will show up too, I'm sure.
[02:48:14.485 --> 02:48:24.090]  Well yeah, and now the Border Patrol is fully converted to standing down on the border and then organizing bases inside the country to deploy illegals all over the nation.
[02:48:24.090 --> 02:48:25.451]  Yeah.
[02:48:25.451 --> 02:48:32.895]  I mean, everybody out here is watching this happen right now and filming because they see the tyranny happening right now.
[02:48:32.895 --> 02:48:40.799]  They're seeing these puppets for the Obama administration just try to put a stranglehold on real Americans out here trying to speak the truth.
[02:48:40.799 --> 02:48:41.980]  None of that altered
[02:48:43.072 --> 02:48:44.293]  Yeah, I don't get why they...
[02:49:02.605 --> 02:49:04.207]  This is just crazy.
[02:49:04.207 --> 02:49:08.491]  You know, it's... I can't believe what I'm seeing here right now.
[02:49:08.491 --> 02:49:16.678]  You can't even come out here and talk on public property, and they have to, like, shuttle you off in some little small free speech zone box.
[02:49:16.678 --> 02:49:17.099]  Watch.
[02:49:17.099 --> 02:49:24.446]  I bet they try to harass those patriots that have a, uh, Culpepper, don't tread on me flag.
[02:49:24.446 --> 02:49:25.767]  I wouldn't doubt it.
[02:49:25.767 --> 02:49:27.909]  They'll probably start running over and tackle him here at any minute.
[02:49:28.888 --> 02:49:34.170]  Well, they're sitting over here, look at them, meeting over here, conspiring for what they're going to do next.
[02:49:34.170 --> 02:49:43.554]  Well, I love how the cops walk up, not so much the woman, but the other guy walks over like, I can't believe you're filming me in a public place when all they do is film us and surveil us.
[02:49:43.554 --> 02:49:52.618]  I can't believe you're concerned about the collapse of America and huge trains from Central and South America pouring in with criminals and you name it.
[02:49:52.618 --> 02:49:54.739]  I can't believe you care.
[02:49:54.739 --> 02:49:55.860]  How dare you, Joe?
[02:49:57.287 --> 02:50:02.432]  Yeah, how dare me exercise my rights as an American?
[02:50:02.432 --> 02:50:09.019]  Well also, they were simply telling you don't block the road, which they'll try jurisdictionally to say you're blocking it and arrest you.
[02:50:09.019 --> 02:50:14.344]  But you can go up to the edge of the sidewalk, you can also use the road to go back and forth.
[02:50:14.344 --> 02:50:16.887]  I would personally... Well look down here, look at this.
[02:50:17.876 --> 02:50:22.738]  All they said, this is a public area, this road right here, this dirt, is public road, public access.
[02:50:22.738 --> 02:50:24.719]  Yeah, it's a right-of-way, it's a right-of-way.
[02:50:24.719 --> 02:50:25.539]  Yeah.
[02:50:25.539 --> 02:50:29.921]  Now they're saying that that's Border Patrol property and we can no longer be there.
[02:50:29.921 --> 02:50:30.782]  Yeah, that's a lie.
[02:50:30.782 --> 02:50:32.963]  You can go to the maps, guaranteed it's not Border Patrol.
[02:50:33.803 --> 02:50:37.024]  By the way, she said, don't you respect private property?
[02:50:37.024 --> 02:50:40.104]  So now the feds call their land private property.
[02:50:40.104 --> 02:50:41.264]  They want fences.
[02:50:41.264 --> 02:50:42.745]  They don't want to be surveilled.
[02:50:42.745 --> 02:50:43.945]  But they want to surveil us.
[02:50:43.945 --> 02:50:50.026]  Because it is a government run by crooks, for crooks, by crooks, of the crooks.
[02:50:50.026 --> 02:50:51.686]  We're going to go to break and come back to you.
[02:50:51.686 --> 02:50:52.987]  Overdrive with calls.
[02:50:52.987 --> 02:50:54.687]  We'll get to Ron in Hawaii, I promise.
[02:50:54.687 --> 02:50:55.947]  We'll get to everybody else.
[02:50:55.947 --> 02:50:56.907]  I mean, this is real radio.
[02:50:56.907 --> 02:50:58.068]  I'm not putting on an act.
[02:50:58.068 --> 02:50:58.548]  I'm angry.
[02:50:58.548 --> 02:50:59.088]  This is sick.
[02:51:01.055 --> 02:51:04.658]  How can you save a ton of money and prepare for emergencies?

[02:52:27.676 --> 02:52:30.599]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[02:52:30.799 --> 02:52:42.486]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[02:52:42.486 --> 02:52:46.329]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[02:52:46.329 --> 02:52:52.953]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[02:52:52.953 --> 02:52:57.976]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[02:52:59.189 --> 02:53:01.470]  Think the national debt is $15 trillion?
[02:53:01.470 --> 02:53:12.416]  Boston U Economics Professor Lawrence Kotlikoff astutely points out that after factoring in guarantees such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and defense expenditures, the national debt is closer to $211 trillion.
[02:53:12.416 --> 02:53:15.457]  Mathematically, this debt is not serviceable via taxation.
[02:53:15.457 --> 02:53:18.319]  And for politicians on Capitol Hill, default is not an option.
[02:53:18.539 --> 02:53:24.543]  So we can expect the Federal Reserve to monetize the shortfall resulting in even more confiscation of our hard-earned savings via inflation.
[02:53:24.543 --> 02:53:27.084]  Hi, my name is Adam Miller with Midas Resources.
[02:53:27.084 --> 02:53:36.410]  In light of the MF Global swindle, it is now more apparent than ever that our savings investments are not secure in the hands of traditional banking institutions overseen by government technocrats kept in their back pockets.
[02:53:36.570 --> 02:53:39.933]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 ext.
[02:53:39.933 --> 02:53:46.659]  148 to find out how you can protect your savings from confiscation with liquid, portable, and private precious metals.
[02:53:46.659 --> 02:53:49.921]  I'll even send you a booklet titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold to serve as a guide.
[02:53:49.921 --> 02:53:50.742]  That number again is 800-686-2237 ext.
[02:53:50.742 --> 02:53:50.762]  148.
[02:53:50.762 --> 02:53:51.022]  800-686-2237 ext. 148.
[02:54:01.212 --> 02:54:03.974]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:54:03.974 --> 02:54:12.239]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:12.239 --> 02:54:19.664]  You have the globalists triggering a giant exodus of refugees from collapsing Latin America into the United States.
[02:54:20.580 --> 02:54:22.221]  This is only the beginning.
[02:54:22.221 --> 02:54:36.409]  And you can expect police and homeland security to bid like hundreds of thousands per major city in your area as a new political force they control, who will carry out political voting operations, rioting, you name it.
[02:54:36.409 --> 02:54:42.012]  The Cubans were used for that in the 80s, very small numbers compared to this, in Florida for political control.
[02:54:43.004 --> 02:54:51.490]  Because they brought in the dregs there as well when Castro dumped his criminals onto the United States.
[02:54:51.490 --> 02:54:54.072]  And that's basically what's happening.
[02:54:54.072 --> 02:54:58.376]  People that have disabilities, people that have criminal records, mothers that are poor with a bunch of kids.
[02:54:58.376 --> 02:55:00.677]  It is party time and the cops are there.
[02:55:00.677 --> 02:55:03.079]  How dare you be an American?
[02:55:03.079 --> 02:55:04.080]  What the?
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:07.623]  You're supposed to cower at home like that judge that went door-to-door in Dallas.
[02:55:09.259 --> 02:55:09.540]  You don't
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:26.120]  We're good to go.
[02:55:49.070 --> 02:55:53.172]  Well, they're gonna make these people look like terrorists on their news websites.
[02:55:53.172 --> 02:55:55.013]  They're gonna call them bigots and things like that.
[02:55:55.013 --> 02:55:57.075]  That's pretty much what they usually always do.
[02:55:57.075 --> 02:56:01.997]  But if you notice, since we've been here, look at all the amount of cops and stuff that have showed up.
[02:56:01.997 --> 02:56:06.500]  When you're an American and you exercise your rights, they come out in full force.
[02:56:08.032 --> 02:56:15.616]  I just think it's hilarious that we went over there and asked them a few questions, and now they brought out a couple of... Well, literally, the enemy showed up!
[02:56:15.616 --> 02:56:16.657]  The enemy showed up!
[02:56:16.657 --> 02:56:17.717]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:56:17.717 --> 02:56:23.280]  When you're a liberty-loving American, you are a terrorist, an enemy to this government now.
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:24.701]  They brought the K-9 units.
[02:56:24.701 --> 02:56:26.522]  Yeah, they brought the K-9 units now.
[02:56:26.522 --> 02:56:28.763]  Yeah, purely for intimidation.
[02:56:28.763 --> 02:56:35.827]  Purely for intimidation to make sure they can commit those felonies and ship those illegals in as fast as they can.
[02:56:36.613 --> 02:56:37.834]  Look at this, pan over here real quick.
[02:56:37.834 --> 02:56:39.036]  Look at all these people over here.
[02:56:39.036 --> 02:56:41.799]  I mean, does that look like people who are terrorists to you?
[02:56:41.799 --> 02:56:51.990]  Everyone's sitting down waving American flags right now, having a good time, and they just don't want buses full of people coming into their town and making their city go bankrupt.
[02:56:54.178 --> 02:56:55.920]  Well, it's undoubtedly.
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:00.544]  Have you seen any, without saying names, any provocateurs trying to stir up trouble?
[02:57:00.544 --> 02:57:05.048]  Oh yeah, there's one possible FBI informant guy here.
[02:57:05.048 --> 02:57:12.234]  Well, listen, the issue here overall is that it's important that there not be any violence there.
[02:57:12.234 --> 02:57:15.477]  It's important that we try to be as peaceful as possible.
[02:57:15.477 --> 02:57:16.958]  But we have to exercise
[02:57:17.959 --> 02:57:18.219]  Exactly.
[02:57:18.219 --> 02:57:23.543]  I'm still waiting for another helicopter to start flying over and having people rappel down right here in our location.
[02:57:43.973 --> 02:57:49.196]  Well Joe, it's frustrating out there live on the street, but you've done an incredible job despite some technical issues.
[02:57:49.196 --> 02:57:50.297]  You and Kit.
[02:57:50.297 --> 02:57:52.118]  When are you guys coming back?
[02:57:52.118 --> 02:57:52.838]  Tomorrow night.
[02:57:53.598 --> 02:57:56.041]  Alright, well, we're going to have more live reports with you.
[02:57:56.041 --> 02:58:00.806]  Let's have a live report at like 11.30, 30 minutes into the show, Central Time tomorrow.
[02:58:00.806 --> 02:58:04.470]  Get your reports filed.
[02:58:04.470 --> 02:58:06.893]  Get those out to everybody that's out there.
[02:58:06.893 --> 02:58:10.977]  And again, we just salute you and commend you, and we'll be praying for you.
[02:58:10.977 --> 02:58:13.540]  And it's just, I don't even think those cops are bad people.
[02:58:14.321 --> 02:58:24.149]  There they are aiding and abetting the Border Patrol that are so happy with their new job to follow orders to import people illegally while citizens are being treated like total slaves.
[02:58:24.149 --> 02:58:29.013]  And it just proves Homeland Security, all of it, is about slavery and is about control.
[02:58:29.013 --> 02:58:34.037]  More videos and articles from Kit Daniels and Joe Biggs at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:34.037 --> 02:58:38.000]  Gonna do some Overdrive now, back in one minute, going right to Ron in Hawaii and others.
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.822]  Stay with us.
[02:58:40.822 --> 02:58:42.524]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.381 --> 02:58:50.407]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.407 --> 02:58:51.689]  I didn't like taste dirt in it.
[02:58:51.689 --> 02:58:53.030]  God knows what's in there.
[02:58:53.030 --> 02:58:57.294]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:58:57.294 --> 02:59:03.180]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:59:03.180 --> 02:59:04.422]  That one is better.
[02:59:04.422 --> 02:59:05.643]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:59:05.643 --> 02:59:07.104]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:59:07.104 --> 02:59:07.625]  It's good water.
[02:59:07.725 --> 02:59:13.769]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:59:13.769 --> 02:59:21.113]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:59:21.113 --> 02:59:23.834]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:59:23.834 --> 02:59:31.919]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:59:31.919 --> 02:59:33.480]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:59:33.480 --> 02:59:34.260]  It's good water.
[02:59:34.260 --> 02:59:34.741]  Refreshing.
[02:59:34.741 --> 02:59:35.201]  It's good!

[02:59:51.154 --> 02:59:52.696]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:52.696 --> 02:59:54.757]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.757 --> 02:59:57.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.192 --> 03:00:11.015]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:11.015 --> 03:00:12.596]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.596 --> 03:00:14.157]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.157 --> 03:00:18.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:22.522]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.522 --> 03:00:26.625]  I apologize to the callers.
[03:00:26.625 --> 03:00:29.326]  Just got stuck behind a bunch of important guests.
[03:00:29.326 --> 03:00:31.608]  Ron in Hawaii, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:32.773 --> 03:00:33.694]  All right, can you hear me?
[03:00:33.694 --> 03:00:34.955]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:34.955 --> 03:00:35.855]  All right.
[03:00:35.855 --> 03:00:36.676]  I'm here since 1968.
[03:00:36.676 --> 03:00:40.079]  I'm a born in the military, you know?
[03:00:40.079 --> 03:00:41.320]  Army brat.
[03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:44.102]  And these people are here in force.
[03:00:44.102 --> 03:00:45.883]  Thousands of them.
[03:00:45.883 --> 03:00:49.026]  And they got brand new SUVs, everything.
[03:00:49.026 --> 03:00:51.688]  Then there's the other side, the gang guys.
[03:00:51.688 --> 03:00:52.769]  They're everywhere.
[03:00:52.769 --> 03:00:54.910]  And then all the cripples.
[03:00:54.910 --> 03:00:56.712]  It's like, they just showed up.
[03:00:56.712 --> 03:00:58.493]  Bam, the last two months.
[03:00:58.493 --> 03:00:59.014]  Thousands.
[03:00:59.625 --> 03:01:09.510]  So you're saying you're in Hawaii and there's the gang contingents, the folks that we're sorry for but are disabled, and then kids are in Hawaii?
[03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:10.150]  Yes.
[03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:12.131]  Thousands.
[03:01:12.131 --> 03:01:14.072]  They got brand new SUVs, they can't even drive.
[03:01:14.072 --> 03:01:18.054]  I ain't kidding.
[03:01:18.054 --> 03:01:18.454]  I know.
[03:01:18.454 --> 03:01:20.155]  I've been seeing that around Austin.
[03:01:20.155 --> 03:01:22.696]  What do you think the cover is here?
[03:01:22.696 --> 03:01:25.077]  We know there's money laundering, drug dealing, mules.
[03:01:25.077 --> 03:01:28.539]  I mean, what else do you think is behind this total takeover?
[03:01:29.178 --> 03:01:32.240]  Well, they're trying to ruin us, just like you said.
[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:33.920]  I never had the internet before.
[03:01:33.920 --> 03:01:37.162]  I knew it was bad, but I didn't know it was this bad, see?
[03:01:37.162 --> 03:01:40.644]  And my daughter just hooked me up with this, and her show.
[03:01:40.644 --> 03:01:44.126]  And I knew it was bad, but this is crazy.
[03:01:44.126 --> 03:01:46.667]  And these people over here, they got bugs all over them.
[03:01:46.667 --> 03:01:47.507]  I can see it crawling around.
[03:01:47.507 --> 03:01:49.488]  I don't even like to ride the bus no more.
[03:01:49.488 --> 03:01:53.910]  They don't... People, the locals don't like riding the bus no more here.
[03:01:53.910 --> 03:01:54.711]  There's thousands.
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:01:58.860]  Man, it's crazy.
[03:01:58.860 --> 03:01:59.581]  No, I hear you.
[03:01:59.581 --> 03:02:04.922]  I mean, Latin America's poor and has a lot of bad things about it, but it's not that bad in many areas.
[03:02:04.922 --> 03:02:10.384]  It's that they're sending the most, you know, absolutely destitute.
[03:02:10.384 --> 03:02:18.746]  And that's a poem about send me your poor, send me your unwashed or whatever, but that's not really what's going on here.
[03:02:19.462 --> 03:02:21.323]  I mean, that's not what built this country.
[03:02:21.323 --> 03:02:23.225]  And it's Cloward and Piven.
[03:02:23.225 --> 03:02:28.168]  That's why the Socialists showed up in Marietta and said, we want Cloward and Piven.
[03:02:28.168 --> 03:02:28.789]  We have the video.
[03:02:28.789 --> 03:02:31.351]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[03:02:31.351 --> 03:02:33.932]  And it's just game over, man, game over.
[03:02:33.932 --> 03:02:40.337]  If America doesn't turn the corner, and I see those Border Patrol, they're bossing citizens around to bring the illegals in.
[03:02:40.337 --> 03:02:45.641]  Now the Border Patrol literally has been fully converted to butlers for the illegals.
[03:02:47.028 --> 03:02:49.690]  And again, I'm not even demonizing the illegals themselves.
[03:02:49.690 --> 03:02:53.112]  They're just a tool, a weapon.
[03:02:53.112 --> 03:02:55.553]  But, in the hands of the globalists, they are a weapon.
[03:02:55.553 --> 03:02:59.035]  Stacey in California, thanks for holding.
[03:02:59.035 --> 03:03:00.336]  Hi, how are you?
[03:03:00.336 --> 03:03:01.577]  I'm alright, thanks for calling.
[03:03:02.779 --> 03:03:03.799]  Thank you.
[03:03:03.799 --> 03:03:15.204]  Yes, I am from Murrieta and I have been out at the protest every day, mostly doing night shift and since before the first buses arrived.
[03:03:15.204 --> 03:03:21.506]  And I realize that you guys are having problems with the Border Patrol right now and the police department on the street there.
[03:03:21.506 --> 03:03:29.889]  I'm on my way there after this phone call, but just know that when there's no cameras around, the
[03:03:33.782 --> 03:03:37.243]  I know.
[03:03:37.243 --> 03:03:40.224]  I know they know they're committing crimes.
[03:03:40.224 --> 03:03:40.964]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[03:03:40.964 --> 03:03:44.104]  The Border Patrol, I don't care if they know it's wrong.
[03:03:44.104 --> 03:03:51.006]  It is a crime under federal law to sit... I mean, I can't send my kids randomly to some other country.
[03:03:51.006 --> 03:03:53.206]  That's child endangerment.
[03:03:53.206 --> 03:03:56.927]  And all I'm saying is... But you're right.
[03:03:56.927 --> 03:04:00.648]  We don't want to turn this into an anti-Border Patrol, anti-police thing.
[03:04:00.648 --> 03:04:00.948]  Go ahead.
[03:04:02.368 --> 03:04:14.538]  What my point is is that they have officially been placed on a gag order and they cannot speak to anyone about anything anymore because too much information has been getting out.
[03:04:14.538 --> 03:04:23.406]  But they have told us and they have told their commanding officers that if they're told to march on us or arrest us they will stand down.
[03:04:24.846 --> 03:04:28.668]  Well, it's clear that that's what they've already decided and that's why they keep backing off.
[03:04:28.668 --> 03:04:30.329]  Usually the cops will just attack you.
[03:04:30.329 --> 03:04:39.274]  But they realize they are so in the wrong here that people are just ready for something to kick off, which I do not want.
[03:04:39.274 --> 03:04:40.615]  So, I agree with you.
[03:04:40.615 --> 03:04:43.016]  I'm going to do some more overdrive, Stacey.
[03:04:43.016 --> 03:04:44.257]  I want to hear more from you on the other side.
[03:04:44.257 --> 03:04:45.057]  Then we're going to go to Louis.

[03:04:55.181 --> 03:04:56.722]  I mean, this is so real, folks.
[03:04:56.722 --> 03:05:01.526]  I just... I just am so angry.
[03:05:01.526 --> 03:05:08.191]  By now, you may know that a Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that's easily transferred from person to person over the Internet.
[03:05:08.191 --> 03:05:09.332]  No bank needed.
[03:05:09.332 --> 03:05:13.195]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited, or closed.
[03:05:13.195 --> 03:05:17.058]  Plus, a large number of businesses and merchants already accept Bitcoins.
[03:05:17.058 --> 03:05:20.621]  And Bitcoins are easily exchanged for dollars, euros, and more.

[03:08:11.292 --> 03:08:12.833]  Fix bayonets.
[03:08:12.833 --> 03:08:20.398]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:08:20.398 --> 03:08:29.204]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:29.204 --> 03:08:30.505]  I just try to do too much.
[03:08:30.505 --> 03:08:34.348]  When I start getting in these whiny moods on air, it's because it just gives me a headache.
[03:08:36.445 --> 03:08:50.654]  To just see all the stuff the globalists are doing, all the crimes they're committing, how they're eroding our freedoms, how they're establishing open tyrannies against us and shutting up homeland security for the American people while aiding Al-Qaeda.
[03:08:50.654 --> 03:08:58.058]  And then I don't like having to sit here and, you know, cold-bloodedly say we can't take all these illegals.
[03:08:58.058 --> 03:09:00.040]  Because as humans, I feel sorry for them.
[03:09:00.888 --> 03:09:07.470]  But it's a globalist plan to manipulate those feelings in me and to bring down the country.
[03:09:07.470 --> 03:09:12.812]  And then I see the Border Patrol saying, get back, get back, so they can bring the buses in.
[03:09:12.812 --> 03:09:22.175]  And I don't want to hate them or the cops that try to aggressively come over and say, get back, just because we're trying to be on the sidewalk.
[03:09:22.175 --> 03:09:27.236]  And, you know, I know the police and the Border Patrol, because we've talked to them, are really freaked out about what's happening.
[03:09:27.236 --> 03:09:28.997]  They know this means the country's collapsing.
[03:09:31.308 --> 03:09:37.599]  You've got the head of the Bar Patrol Union, the deputy head, saying they're under a gag order, says no agents securing border.
[03:09:37.599 --> 03:09:39.863]  They were ordered to stand down three and a half months ago.
[03:09:39.863 --> 03:09:42.708]  I mean, that is sin-sational!
[03:09:44.088 --> 03:09:53.173]  And still, we can't get it out in the news, other than InfoWars.com, DrudgeReport.com, OrlentDaily.com, maybe the WashingtonTimes.com.
[03:09:53.173 --> 03:09:58.656]  And then when we reported, okay, New York Times goes, yeah, we're busting them all over the country.
[03:09:58.656 --> 03:10:08.801]  And then now, they're building up so much in these cities, from Michigan to Texas, from California to New York, from Alabama to Washington State, that even Democrat cities are freaking out.
[03:10:08.801 --> 03:10:12.644]  People are going, man, there's 10,000 kids here, and a bunch of men.
[03:10:13.979 --> 03:10:38.388]  I mean I went down to the hike and bike trail in the middle of nowhere where there's never people to take the dog last weekend and I've been to Guatemala and I have family that live there so I have a lot of Guatemalan machete and Guatemalan bags and stuff and I said I've seen that before and I walked over and talked to the people and I said you from Guatemala and they were like see Guatemala
[03:10:39.301 --> 03:10:45.384]  And it was like a grandma in the water with a tin can and like woven string fishing.
[03:10:45.384 --> 03:10:47.604]  And they had bags.
[03:10:47.604 --> 03:10:59.269]  And I saw where there'd been a fire and I was like, my God, there's people from Guatemala living on the hike and bike trail.
[03:10:59.269 --> 03:11:01.230]  And again, I don't dislike them as people.
[03:11:01.230 --> 03:11:05.432]  I have someone on my iPhone, actually.
[03:11:05.432 --> 03:11:08.073]  But I realize this is an unlimited stream, a weapon.
[03:11:09.448 --> 03:11:21.451]  Because they'll end up, after a while, getting on the welfare rolls, getting into the system, and politically doing whatever the Democratic Party tells them to do.
[03:11:21.451 --> 03:11:27.493]  And this is the Republican Party helping kill the country.
[03:11:27.493 --> 03:11:32.854]  If you don't get it, folks, you use a tin can with a string tied to it, and then you can roll it, see?
[03:11:32.854 --> 03:11:37.175]  And that's a real... That's a rod and reel with just the can.
[03:11:41.724 --> 03:11:48.690]  And again, this is a family with like five kids and grandma that fled Guatemala.
[03:11:48.690 --> 03:11:50.952]  And I totally get why they want to be here.
[03:11:50.952 --> 03:11:56.036]  But I guess they haven't paid the coyotes or whatever enough here in Austin that run the Democratic Party.
[03:11:56.036 --> 03:12:00.520]  If you don't pay them a bunch of money, they'll beat you over the head with a baseball bat or kill you and bury you in their backyard.
[03:12:00.520 --> 03:12:07.285]  I mean, they just dig them up everywhere with the Democratic Party people's houses and just get swept under the rug because they're really exploiting these people.
[03:12:07.285 --> 03:12:08.746]  You want to be honest about it.
[03:12:08.746 --> 03:12:10.067]  And then I kind of clicked this morning.
[03:12:11.058 --> 03:12:12.178]  Maybe Glenn Beck's right.
[03:12:12.178 --> 03:12:15.159]  Maybe we do bring him soccer balls and teddy bears.
[03:12:15.159 --> 03:12:19.320]  But then, that takes the moral high ground away from the Democrats that are causing all this.
[03:12:19.320 --> 03:12:22.581]  And then we point out, why is Latin America so corrupt?
[03:12:22.581 --> 03:12:24.261]  Why can't they be helped?
[03:12:24.261 --> 03:12:26.222]  And then point out what the Democrats are planning to do.
[03:12:26.222 --> 03:12:30.483]  I mean, maybe I'm wrong to say that's just a sick ploy.
[03:12:30.483 --> 03:12:31.123]  Or a stunt.
[03:12:34.537 --> 03:12:41.138]  But UC professor says immigration influx is about re-education of society and a permanent subservient class.
[03:12:41.138 --> 03:12:43.059]  And that's it.
[03:12:43.059 --> 03:12:45.599]  Who are under government control so they're not independent.
[03:12:45.599 --> 03:12:48.960]  Stacey, you're saying you live there in Marietta, you're about to get off work and go down there.
[03:12:48.960 --> 03:12:52.281]  And you're saying you've talked to the Border Patrol and police down there.
[03:12:52.281 --> 03:12:54.241]  We've talked to them too.
[03:12:54.241 --> 03:12:57.902]  In other areas of Texas and ICE agents and emergency managers.
[03:12:57.902 --> 03:13:00.102]  What you're saying is true.
[03:13:00.102 --> 03:13:02.023]  But nevertheless, they're following the orders.
[03:13:05.385 --> 03:13:07.306]  Again, we don't have long to stop this collapse.
[03:13:07.306 --> 03:13:10.286]  I don't know how long we've got, but the trains are more full now.
[03:13:10.286 --> 03:13:12.667]  There's more of them.
[03:13:12.667 --> 03:13:17.949]  And Homeland Security is now the collapse system.
[03:13:17.949 --> 03:13:22.530]  And this is clearly what Obama's planning to collapse the country, amongst other things.
[03:13:22.530 --> 03:13:26.991]  There's no doubt the Socialists showed up with the Democratic Party and admitted that yesterday.
[03:13:26.991 --> 03:13:30.172]  In Marietta, we have the video, and it's just mind-blowing.
[03:13:30.172 --> 03:13:31.813]  It is mind-blowing.
[03:13:34.142 --> 03:13:42.004]  And to see this happening, and to realize it's happening, and to realize it's not going to help the people once the U.S.
[03:13:42.004 --> 03:13:45.785]  collapses, there'll be nowhere to run.
[03:13:45.785 --> 03:13:49.106]  Anyways, Stacy, anything else?
[03:13:49.106 --> 03:13:49.526]  Yes.
[03:13:49.526 --> 03:14:01.890]  Well, I just wanted to say that after Tuesday, when we had turned the buses around successfully, I did go down to San Diego, because I heard that's where our buses were being diverted.
[03:14:02.771 --> 03:14:12.214]  So I went to San Diego and I went to a few border patrol stations down there to try to find out where they were going because I knew they're not being sent back to Texas.
[03:14:12.214 --> 03:14:24.618]  But I had found out that they were, after being spread around all of San Diego County, they had been now collected into one particular facility in Chula Vista at 311 Athees Street.
[03:14:26.318 --> 03:14:34.064]  They are being housed there, and this area is right on the border of Tijuana and San Diego.
[03:14:34.064 --> 03:14:36.126]  It's a very dangerous neighborhood.
[03:14:36.126 --> 03:14:45.973]  If you wave the American flag, it's like waving a target, so they know there will be no protest of anyone stopping buses from entering that facility.
[03:14:45.973 --> 03:14:52.598]  However, the disease and contamination that is spreading and is rampant is why they've had to be condensed to one location.
[03:14:53.716 --> 03:14:59.421]  Wow, and they're not letting congressmen into these facilities.
[03:14:59.421 --> 03:15:01.422]  I mean, this is just so illegal.
[03:15:01.422 --> 03:15:02.563]  Where's the child welfare?
[03:15:02.563 --> 03:15:09.929]  I mean, they're taking homeschoolers' kids because they make nothing but A's, and then you've got these kids being exploited.
[03:15:09.929 --> 03:15:11.651]  Can you imagine what they're doing to these kids?
[03:15:13.424 --> 03:15:35.060]  Well that's the other thing is that after I followed them there and after I was at Border Patrol and I drove across, I was driving along the border looking and watching these people, I drove to ICE headquarters in downtown San Diego in Front Street and I sat out there by myself protesting and as ICE agents came up to me and asked what I was doing there,
[03:15:36.161 --> 03:15:46.149]  Some people, men in their mid-twenties, walked up and asked the ICE officers for directions to the trolley station.
[03:15:46.149 --> 03:15:52.955]  And as the ICE officers were trying to give them directions, the men started laughing and saying, ah, we just got released!
[03:15:52.955 --> 03:15:54.757]  Ha ha, we're so happy!
[03:15:54.757 --> 03:15:55.638]  In broken English.
[03:15:56.358 --> 03:16:01.603]  And the ICE agents put their hand up and said, I can't talk to you and turned around and walked away.
[03:16:01.603 --> 03:16:02.684]  And I said, are you kidding me?
[03:16:02.684 --> 03:16:04.846]  I said, why aren't you arresting them?
[03:16:04.846 --> 03:16:05.586]  I said, you know what?
[03:16:05.586 --> 03:16:07.708]  The trolley station is around the corner.
[03:16:07.708 --> 03:16:11.051]  You take the southbound line all the way till it stops.
[03:16:11.051 --> 03:16:11.571]  No, no, no.
[03:16:11.571 --> 03:16:13.233]  I mean, they release them publicly.
[03:16:13.233 --> 03:16:14.794]  You've got to tell that testimony.
[03:16:14.794 --> 03:16:18.838]  Go out there and tell Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels.
[03:16:20.663 --> 03:16:24.527]  Tell them everything that you just told us.
[03:16:24.527 --> 03:16:25.287]  It's very powerful.
[03:16:25.287 --> 03:16:25.828]  God bless you.
[03:16:25.828 --> 03:16:28.230]  They're going to be out there all day and they come back tomorrow night.
[03:16:28.230 --> 03:16:29.491]  Thank you, Stacey.
[03:16:29.491 --> 03:16:31.193]  Lewis in South Carolina.
[03:16:31.193 --> 03:16:33.455]  Go ahead.
[03:16:33.455 --> 03:16:34.236]  Oh yes, Alex.
[03:16:34.236 --> 03:16:36.178]  I wanted to say thanks for taking my call.
[03:16:36.178 --> 03:16:45.927]  I wanted to speak directly regarding the problem with Rhode Island using DNA against
[03:16:47.544 --> 03:16:49.526]  Uh, with school children.
[03:16:49.526 --> 03:16:53.833]  That's right, now states like Rhode Island are passing laws that take DNA from everybody.
[03:16:53.833 --> 03:16:56.356]  First they denied they were doing this with babies at birth.
[03:16:56.356 --> 03:16:59.401]  Now they say in the bill it will re-legalize that.
[03:17:00.549 --> 03:17:04.232]  Right, and I wanted to speak directly to your previous caller who's an expectant parent.
[03:17:04.232 --> 03:17:15.221]  Everyone out there who's an expectant parent, they need to stand up to this and politely let me talk to the provider and tell them, I know, I understand the value of the Gut-Reef Test, the Heal-Prick Test that harvests this information.
[03:17:15.221 --> 03:17:19.285]  It's a useful prophylactic to test for things like Tay-Sachs and other congenital diseases.
[03:17:19.645 --> 03:17:20.966]  I understand the value of it.
[03:17:20.966 --> 03:17:23.247]  They say, make your intentions known.
[03:17:23.247 --> 03:17:25.929]  They will not have this test on religious grounds.
[03:17:25.929 --> 03:17:32.933]  They will turn this test down unless they get a written assertion to do this test in a private facility, separate private facilities.
[03:17:32.933 --> 03:17:33.633]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:17:33.633 --> 03:17:37.115]  Because they'll say we're going to do blood tests, but it doesn't even really get done.
[03:17:37.115 --> 03:17:39.617]  They send it to the health department and the feds.
[03:17:39.617 --> 03:17:42.758]  I first, we first broke that a long time ago.
[03:17:42.758 --> 03:17:46.741]  And now it's mainstream news that, oh, we got to get the blood again for our secret database.
[03:17:47.381 --> 03:17:50.502]  And again, just government does whatever it wants.
[03:17:50.502 --> 03:17:53.023]  And it wants to collapse the country.
[03:17:53.023 --> 03:17:55.704]  That's what this is all a plan for.
[03:17:55.704 --> 03:17:57.564]  And it's totally disgusting.
[03:17:57.564 --> 03:18:00.826]  We're going to skip this network break and go to the bottom of the hour.
[03:18:00.826 --> 03:18:03.286]  Mike in Toronto, you're on the air.
[03:18:03.286 --> 03:18:05.587]  Thanks for holding.
[03:18:05.587 --> 03:18:07.588]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[03:18:07.588 --> 03:18:09.228]  Sometimes I get exhausted.
[03:18:09.228 --> 03:18:10.709]  It's just too crazy.
[03:18:11.536 --> 03:18:12.537]  Yeah.
[03:18:12.537 --> 03:18:16.939]  Listen, I just wanted to get your take on this and see what it means.
[03:18:16.939 --> 03:18:22.843]  Basically, if you remember 14 years ago, there was the whole case with Elian Gonzalez.
[03:18:22.843 --> 03:18:28.446]  One kid that was sent here, his mother died on the way over from Cuba, but he was sent here.
[03:18:28.446 --> 03:18:33.349]  There was a custody case where his father wanted to bring him back to Cuba.
[03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:37.052]  You just mentioned a while ago there are a thousand kids or thousands of kids
[03:18:38.873 --> 03:18:48.479]  Oh yeah, the government grabbed him away from his family, sent him back, child welfare, SWAT teams, because they care.
[03:18:48.479 --> 03:18:49.560]  The truth is, they don't care.
[03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:51.441]  The globalists can care less.
[03:18:51.441 --> 03:18:54.163]  Like, they hate basically everybody but themselves.
[03:18:54.163 --> 03:18:58.386]  It's just, it's just, they suspend whatever laws they want, whenever they want.
[03:18:58.386 --> 03:19:02.588]  And again, they're encouraging the whole thing and busing them in.
[03:19:02.588 --> 03:19:03.469]  It's all planned.
[03:19:04.889 --> 03:19:13.800]  How would they possibly know what the status of every child is if they're just busting them and can't process them and let them go?
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:15.122]  No, no, I hear you.
[03:19:15.122 --> 03:19:18.707]  Listen, it's a plan by design.
[03:19:18.707 --> 03:19:19.187]  On record.
[03:19:19.187 --> 03:19:20.589]  I appreciate your call.
[03:19:20.589 --> 03:19:22.251]  Duke in Oklahoma, thanks for calling.
[03:19:22.251 --> 03:19:22.571]  Go ahead.
[03:19:24.403 --> 03:19:32.389]  Yeah, well, Merrick Fallon is allowing 1,100 of them, they say, here in Oklahoma.
[03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:35.572]  And that's just a door open, is all that is.
[03:19:35.572 --> 03:19:37.554]  By the way, that's a total PSYOP.
[03:19:37.554 --> 03:19:41.677]  They always say in the first announcement, oh, there'll be 1,100 at this school.
[03:19:41.677 --> 03:19:44.759]  That's $10,000 per town when they're done, OK?
[03:19:44.759 --> 03:19:46.221]  It's to collapse the country.
[03:19:47.290 --> 03:19:51.272]  And so, again, there's already, they say it's 5 million illegals, it's 30 million.
[03:19:51.272 --> 03:19:53.613]  I mean, that's a conservative number that are already here.
[03:19:53.613 --> 03:19:58.415]  I mean, it's always 10, 20, 30 times what they say.
[03:19:58.415 --> 03:20:08.340]  Same time, they're shutting down, starting to shut down roadways and they're doing a lot more bags where they'll just shut the road down if they see a couple backpacks or something like that.
[03:20:08.340 --> 03:20:09.281]  And they'll shut the road down.
[03:20:09.281 --> 03:20:11.902]  They're getting people ready for something.
[03:20:15.046 --> 03:20:18.729]  Yeah, we need to be talking about what they're going to do when the collapse accelerates.
[03:20:18.729 --> 03:20:20.110]  That's what we should be focusing on.
[03:20:20.110 --> 03:20:21.552]  What comes next?
[03:20:21.552 --> 03:20:22.873]  The waves are getting bigger.
[03:20:22.873 --> 03:20:24.734]  How big will they get?
[03:20:24.734 --> 03:20:28.558]  Because there's a depression all over the Caribbean and Central and South America.
[03:20:28.558 --> 03:20:30.239]  Mexico has failed.
[03:20:30.239 --> 03:20:31.760]  I mean, that's a fact.
[03:20:31.760 --> 03:20:40.908]  And now the federal government has decided to allow collapsing countries to collapse into ours, which is an act of political war.
[03:20:42.114 --> 03:20:44.115]  I mean, refugees can wreck a country.
[03:20:44.115 --> 03:20:45.716]  That's well known.
[03:20:45.716 --> 03:20:51.639]  And they have done this now, and... I mean, this is just over the top.
[03:20:51.639 --> 03:20:58.103]  And then if you don't accept the collapse, Robert Rodriguez and Obama will say you're a racist pushing race war.
[03:20:58.103 --> 03:21:07.228]  And then when the collapse happens, and the welfare checks don't get there, or the dollar's devalued and it won't buy enough, the entire country's gonna burn.
[03:21:07.228 --> 03:21:07.868]  And that's the plan.
[03:21:08.931 --> 03:21:10.733]  I know you are too, brother.
[03:21:10.733 --> 03:21:11.695]  So, let's just keep fighting.
[03:21:27.403 --> 03:21:29.484]  Well, you know, they're preparing us right now.
[03:21:29.484 --> 03:21:38.288]  If you just look around at what they're doing, you can kind of get an idea, a glimpse of what they're trying to set up or stage.
[03:21:38.288 --> 03:21:43.090]  And you can watch the news all you want, or you can pay attention to what's going on in your town.
[03:21:43.090 --> 03:21:44.551]  But it's great that we're all connected.
[03:21:44.551 --> 03:21:47.613]  We're able to talk to each other by using your program.
[03:21:51.135 --> 03:21:53.358]  Uh, to communicate these things and get them out there.
[03:21:53.358 --> 03:21:57.044]  We should have had more cameras down there in California whenever they went up to Biggs.
[03:21:57.044 --> 03:22:01.532]  They should have... We should have had three or four other people videotaping those camera guys.
[03:22:01.532 --> 03:22:03.875]  That way we can expose this stuff for what it really is.
[03:22:03.875 --> 03:22:05.158]  We've got to have backup.
[03:22:07.836 --> 03:22:08.256]  I hear you.
[03:22:08.256 --> 03:22:08.877]  God bless you.
[03:22:08.877 --> 03:22:13.719]  I mean, I'm reading the headlines at InfoWars.com and RoadsReport.com, El Paso Times.
[03:22:13.719 --> 03:22:17.361]  Another plane lands in El Paso carrying more undocumented immigrants.
[03:22:17.361 --> 03:22:27.726]  The official who spoke on the background said the Border Patrol has been getting family groups and processing them before turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who then ships them deeper into the U.S.
[03:22:27.726 --> 03:22:29.006]  I mean, the word's out.
[03:22:29.006 --> 03:22:31.047]  You get here, you're legal.
[03:22:31.047 --> 03:22:35.229]  But, me as a citizen, I can hardly get back in the country.
[03:22:35.229 --> 03:22:36.790]  Death train derails in Mexico.
[03:22:40.659 --> 03:22:43.321]  Magazine reports, amnesty disaster for black workers.
[03:22:43.321 --> 03:22:46.844]  It's a disaster for everybody.
[03:22:46.844 --> 03:22:51.247]  Administration turns to churches to avoid clashes.
[03:22:51.247 --> 03:22:54.310]  Volunteers work to identify bodies of dead children.
[03:22:54.310 --> 03:22:59.574]  Muslim prayer rug found on Arizona border.
[03:22:59.574 --> 03:23:02.436]  More military bases asked to open facilities.
[03:23:02.436 --> 03:23:04.638]  Homeland closing roads to keep reporters out.
[03:23:09.778 --> 03:23:12.079]  I mean this is just, this is just insane.
[03:23:32.005 --> 03:23:33.226]  You know, to one of these other issues.
[03:23:33.226 --> 03:23:39.951]  I'm going to watch some of these videos and change that headline, because it's a whole bunch of videos boiling all this down.
[03:23:39.951 --> 03:23:52.020]  And so, I think the headline should be, Border Patrol Operates Outside Their Jurisdiction, Tries To Keep Reporters Away From Buses.
[03:23:52.020 --> 03:23:56.704]  I mean, Border Patrol tries to keep press away from buses in Marietta.
[03:23:56.704 --> 03:23:57.965]  You know, that's it.
[03:23:57.965 --> 03:23:58.646]  There's your headline.
[03:23:59.534 --> 03:24:07.101]  So, that's a very important article up on InfoWars.com.
[03:24:07.101 --> 03:24:08.963]  That's just some of the news we've got up there.
[03:24:08.963 --> 03:24:12.546]  Caroline in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:24:12.546 --> 03:24:14.849]  Hi Alex, good to talk to you.
[03:24:14.849 --> 03:24:24.598]  I'm up here in upstate New York and I called my congressman, who is Tom Reed, and this little trendy answered the phone like always.
[03:24:25.239 --> 03:24:33.665]  And I said, well, how many, how many unaccompanied illegal aliens are being shipped into New York?
[03:24:33.665 --> 03:24:35.426]  And he didn't know.
[03:24:35.426 --> 03:24:40.069]  And I'm like, well, what are you answering the phone for if you don't know how many are being shipped in here?
[03:24:40.069 --> 03:24:47.014]  So I'm being given the runaround every time I call his office to ask him a question.
[03:24:47.014 --> 03:24:49.435]  It's just a runaround.
[03:24:49.435 --> 03:24:50.896]  They don't know how many.
[03:24:50.896 --> 03:24:52.877]  And I said, well, what are you doing about it?
[03:24:52.877 --> 03:24:55.079]  And they said, oh, well, we're looking into it.
[03:24:55.911 --> 03:24:58.232]  It's just crazy.
[03:24:58.232 --> 03:25:07.178]  And remember though, they have federally funded checkpoints where they take blood without warrants now, intimidating people, and surveillance and cameras everywhere.
[03:25:07.178 --> 03:25:10.500]  We just had a checkpoint the other week.
[03:25:10.500 --> 03:25:16.683]  I was driving to work, and there was a sign on the side of the road that said, slow down, checkpoint.
[03:25:16.683 --> 03:25:22.327]  I mean, it was early in the morning, so it wasn't set up yet, and I'm thinking, what the heck is this all about?
[03:25:23.086 --> 03:25:25.670]  So, I mean, it's just crazy up here.
[03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:31.577]  We have so much, so many drug addicts and people on Medicare and disability.
[03:25:31.577 --> 03:25:40.690]  They just shut down the, you know, they want to shut down our handicapped workshop and just release all these people onto the street with nowhere to go.
[03:25:41.010 --> 03:25:41.670]  Oh yeah, that's it.
[03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:51.033]  They're getting rid of the mental health, they're getting rid of the workshops for poor people, they're cutting all the social networks that would help black, white, Hispanic, poor people, and just dumping more in.
[03:25:51.033 --> 03:25:53.114]  This is the planned collapse.
[03:25:53.114 --> 03:25:54.255]  Undoubtedly.
[03:25:54.255 --> 03:25:56.775]  The question is, what are they planning to pull during it?
[03:25:56.775 --> 03:26:00.377]  I mean, I am so on the edge of my seat right now.
[03:26:00.377 --> 03:26:02.737]  Because we're not going to have to wait to see what's going to happen now.
[03:26:02.737 --> 03:26:05.238]  It's all about to get crazy.
[03:26:05.238 --> 03:26:09.280]  I told this trendy, I told him too, I said, look up Cloward and Piven.
[03:26:09.280 --> 03:26:10.380]  I said, you'll learn a lot.
[03:26:10.914 --> 03:26:17.195]  I said, and this is a controlled collapse, and it's going to lower wages here.
[03:26:17.195 --> 03:26:21.056]  I said, and also, your future is doomed.
[03:26:21.056 --> 03:26:27.818]  I said, these illegal aliens are being given in-state tuition, any state they want to go to school in.
[03:26:27.818 --> 03:26:29.118]  I said, how about you?
[03:26:29.118 --> 03:26:31.318]  Are you being given in-state tuition?
[03:26:31.318 --> 03:26:34.019]  No, you're being made a debt slave.
[03:26:34.019 --> 03:26:36.219]  And these guys get a free ride.
[03:26:36.219 --> 03:26:39.500]  Again, they're being used because they're so pliable.
[03:26:40.854 --> 03:26:49.016]  They will do whatever the government tells them, aka the Democratic Party, and they only need a few more percentage points to ban guns in Texas and New York and California.
[03:26:49.016 --> 03:26:52.376]  And in fact, California's already got the votes, New York hasn't, and they're taking the guns.
[03:26:52.376 --> 03:26:53.856]  And so that's why they're doing it.
[03:26:53.856 --> 03:26:56.257]  I mean, this is to turn the whole country blue.
[03:26:56.257 --> 03:27:00.038]  The Republican leadership's going along with it, and I mean, it's on.
[03:27:00.038 --> 03:27:00.898]  I appreciate your call.
[03:27:00.898 --> 03:27:02.178]  Great points, Caroline in New York.
[03:27:02.178 --> 03:27:03.138]  Thanks for holding.
[03:27:03.138 --> 03:27:05.859]  Look at this InfoWars.com posted article by Max Labo.
[03:27:08.576 --> 03:27:10.997]  You know what hit the fan report?
[03:27:10.997 --> 03:27:12.337]  Shock report!
[03:27:12.337 --> 03:27:17.799]  70 million people would be starving in the streets without government welfare programs.
[03:27:17.799 --> 03:27:21.600]  The fundamental numbers behind all the propaganda tell a starkly different story.
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:22.981]  101 million are on welfare.
[03:27:22.981 --> 03:27:26.682]  70 plus million are on total welfare.
[03:27:26.682 --> 03:27:29.783]  That's a weapon!
[03:27:29.783 --> 03:27:33.924]  Because these aren't just like cows you quit feeding and they jump the fence and go somewhere else or die.
[03:27:35.558 --> 03:27:39.499]  These are human beings that will burn, destroy, kill.
[03:27:39.499 --> 03:27:40.359]  But they won't have to do that.
[03:27:40.359 --> 03:27:44.080]  They just gotta politically get in line and they'll get their freebies.
[03:27:44.080 --> 03:27:45.640]  I mean, it's a total plan.
[03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:47.441]  You wonder how America will be conquered?
[03:27:47.441 --> 03:27:48.221]  This is it.
[03:27:48.221 --> 03:27:51.202]  And it's not 20 years from now like they said 20 years ago.
[03:27:51.202 --> 03:27:52.482]  It's now.
[03:27:52.482 --> 03:27:55.643]  It's just about to start.
[03:27:55.643 --> 03:28:00.804]  As I keep telling you, it's gonna get crazier and crazier and crazier.
[03:28:03.157 --> 03:28:07.981]  And all of you that have played along with it are literally digging your own graves.
[03:28:07.981 --> 03:28:10.963]  Last caller I have time for, I apologize to the others.
[03:28:10.963 --> 03:28:12.284]  Ray in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:28:12.284 --> 03:28:14.866]  You'll be on tail gunner.
[03:28:14.866 --> 03:28:16.027]  Tail gunner, I like that.
[03:28:16.027 --> 03:28:17.328]  Am I on now?
[03:28:17.328 --> 03:28:18.809]  You are, brother.
[03:28:18.809 --> 03:28:19.450]  Okay, good.
[03:28:19.450 --> 03:28:22.792]  I'm going to talk to you about the chemtrails.
[03:28:22.792 --> 03:28:27.476]  I was working on a roof recently and I'm seeing them spray usually populated areas.
[03:28:27.476 --> 03:28:28.517]  Am I correct in saying that?
[03:28:29.380 --> 03:28:31.401]  Well, they're doing atmospheric manipulations in a lot of them.
[03:28:31.401 --> 03:28:33.563]  They've also got lower sprays.
[03:28:33.563 --> 03:28:34.103]  We don't know.
[03:28:34.103 --> 03:28:35.484]  There's a lot of declassified stuff.
[03:28:35.484 --> 03:28:36.565]  It's a giant program.
[03:28:36.565 --> 03:28:37.886]  We're not sure what's going on.
[03:28:37.886 --> 03:28:38.266]  Okay.
[03:28:38.266 --> 03:28:44.250]  Well, usually classified materials are nine times out of ten weapons-based.
[03:28:44.250 --> 03:28:55.097]  So, I stumbled on Mazer technology recently on the internet with the World War II when they were practicing on the Japanese POWs and microwaving them to death.
[03:28:55.097 --> 03:28:55.317]  Yes.
[03:28:56.821 --> 03:29:15.506]  And I noticed that they had said something, if they can get something inside your body and... Oh yeah, no, I mean that's a big part of the aluminum dioxide and other barium salts and things is to resonate with the maser technology and slow fry you so they can actuary out when you'll die.
[03:29:15.506 --> 03:29:18.727]  Oh yeah, that's a big part of the frequency pollution program we're under.
[03:29:18.727 --> 03:29:18.867]  Yep.
[03:29:19.710 --> 03:29:30.700]  Yeah, so I was looking at my microwave door and I noticed that the microwave door, if you can go ahead and get something to stop the maser technology from getting to your body, is it possible to stop?
[03:29:31.570 --> 03:29:33.311]  The, uh, the Maser, uh, technology.
[03:29:33.311 --> 03:29:40.253]  Well, sir, I just think you should drink fluoride, take all the shots, and eat the GMO, and corn syrup, and just worship government.
[03:29:40.253 --> 03:29:42.974]  I mean, don't be extreme, and don't say the word bossy.
[03:29:42.974 --> 03:29:45.795]  Michelle Obama said not to, and she's the boss, okay?
[03:29:45.795 --> 03:29:48.116]  Alright, that's not bossy for her to say don't be bossy.
[03:29:48.116 --> 03:29:49.357]  I mean, it's totally normal.
[03:29:49.357 --> 03:29:51.237]  Great job with the crew.
[03:29:51.237 --> 03:29:53.018]  I want to thank all our affiliates.
[03:29:53.018 --> 03:29:54.058]  Pray for an awakening.
[03:29:54.058 --> 03:29:57.580]  We've already hit the rocks.
[03:29:57.580 --> 03:29:58.460]  How will we break up?
