[00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:09.926]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.507]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:13.048]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:17.251]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:21.313]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:47.263]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and broadcasting worldwide today.
[00:00:47.263 --> 00:00:48.244]  There are no guests.
[00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:52.747]  We're going to have open phones and cover masses of news.
[00:00:52.747 --> 00:01:05.196]  We may have on the gun shop owner, tattoo parlor owner, and others that were right in the middle of the shops being looted and burned, but no one burned them down because they stood out front their shops
[00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:16.242]  Black, white owners, you name it, with AR-15s and shotguns, just like the Korean shopkeepers back in the L.A.
[00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.464]  riots.
[00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:25.308]  And so the folks rioting there, basically in a suburb of St.
[00:01:25.308 --> 00:01:29.770]  Louis, were unable to rob that area.
[00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.192]  Again, there's two different issues going on here.
[00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.895]  Did the police shoot a man with his hands up?
[00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.557]  Maybe.
[00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:50.870]  Don't forget Oscar Grant and other stories where they claimed he had assaulted the officers and he had done no such thing and was in handcuffs on the ground and the cop pulled the gun out, cold-bloodedly shot him right in the back.
[00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.293]  And then was later convicted and only served a year and a half in prison.
[00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:58.177]  The bullet went through his back, hit the concrete, bounced back up
[00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:11.817]  And went into his chest for a second time, ricocheting back up into his body.
[00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:14.297]  So I understand why people get upset by this.
[00:02:14.297 --> 00:02:20.499]  I'm concerned about this, the militarization of police, where they're basically trained the public are terrorists in general.
[00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:26.661]  And that does cause a lot of excessive force to be used.
[00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:34.924]  There are a lot of mentally ill people that obviously gravitate towards sadistic activities and want the uniform and want the power.
[00:02:34.924 --> 00:02:36.885]  That's a historic problem.
[00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:41.067]  And more and more police departments, especially in big cities, are not trying to keep those people out.
[00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:46.445]  And so that's why we're seeing things like this intensify.
[00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:53.849]  It's basically a power grab like we saw back a few years ago with the Boston bombing.
[00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:10.880]  It was a citizen that caught the Patsy sleeping in the boat outside the Cordon area where one half of Boston was searched and black people, white people, you name it, that had no resemblance to the Czarnev brother they were looking for
[00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:23.377]  We're being pulled out of their houses, pulled out of their cars, at gunpoint, in a giant police state orgy power grab.
[00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:30.819]  And it's time for the system to stop denying that we're moving into an authoritarian, totalitarian model.
[00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.260]  They denied the NSA was spying, now it's all admitted.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.240]  They denied so many other things.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.282]  They've denied that they were adding things to vaccines, part of Trojan Horse secret programs.
[00:03:41.282 --> 00:03:42.502]  They've been caught over and over again.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.922]  They said that smart meters wouldn't track what you did and wouldn't control the temperature in your house.
[00:03:49.922 --> 00:03:51.503]  Now they admit they do.
[00:03:51.503 --> 00:04:08.389]  This is part of a revolution by criminal elements in government and major corporations that interface with it to dominate and control society and manage the population like we're a bunch of cattle, aka Soylent Green.
[00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:17.060]  And this whole broadcast is simply about getting people to think outside of the box and to be made aware of that.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.282]  So that is our main mission.
[00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:26.887]  So we're going to get into the situation unfolding in St.
[00:04:26.887 --> 00:04:33.331]  Louis and surrounding areas because it's a microcosm of what's going to unfold on a wider scale in this country.
[00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:37.734]  We're going to get into kill switch smartphone bill passes in California.
[00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:44.140]  We're going to break down the knockout game where blacks physically attack white people.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.961]  You don't see whites out burning down black neighborhoods because of that.
[00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:53.182]  We're going to look at how MSNBC and others have promoted this thug, racist culture.
[00:04:53.182 --> 00:04:56.724]  And then we're also going to look at Gardasil shots killing more people.
[00:04:56.724 --> 00:04:57.244]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.344 --> 00:05:05.512]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:10.058]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:05:10.058 --> 00:05:14.624]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:17.965]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:23.407]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:05:23.407 --> 00:05:30.790]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.912]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:39.694]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:40.034 --> 00:05:48.478]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:52.920]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:05:59.488 --> 00:06:05.632]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:08.934]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:10.735]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:06:10.735 --> 00:06:17.079]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:22.963]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:06:23.123 --> 00:06:27.085]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:29.967]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:38.432]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:40.533]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:41.574]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:50.887]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:07.308]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:07:07.308 --> 00:07:09.088]  Can you put two and two together?

[00:08:11.885 --> 00:08:13.725]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:33.390]  It's the time of the season When love runs high In this time Give it to me easy And let me try With pleasured hands To take you in the sun
[00:08:45.415 --> 00:08:50.440]  Well, here we are on Tuesday, the 12th day already of August 2014.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:59.829]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:02.652]  We will have open phones throughout the three hours.
[00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:11.238]  You know, I was thinking about the folks that have been rioting in Ferguson and in areas of South St.
[00:09:11.238 --> 00:09:11.638]  Louis.
[00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:19.624]  They've been burning down shops and businesses and grocery stores and mini-marts and homes.
[00:09:19.624 --> 00:09:24.648]  And I realized that they're only following the example of the U.S.
[00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:26.870]  federal government.
[00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:31.434]  Because if a police officer did shoot an 18-year-old black man
[00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:45.218]  In cold blood, with his hands up, as witnesses say, which certainly has happened before and is happening with more frequency, because of instinctive shooting training, mainly.
[00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:50.359]  If that is the case, it makes total sense.
[00:09:50.359 --> 00:09:55.540]  Because if the police kill someone who's innocent,
[00:09:56.403 --> 00:09:59.165]  You don't go attack the police station.
[00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:05.050]  You don't go try to burn down the police station or burn down police cars or attack police.
[00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.251]  By the way, I'm not endorsing that.
[00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:08.393]  I'm just saying, hypothetically.
[00:10:08.393 --> 00:10:08.894]  No, no, no.
[00:10:08.894 --> 00:10:15.199]  You burn up your own neighborhood and any shops that are white-owned.
[00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:18.662]  That will certainly, certainly show them.
[00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:24.300]  And how are they taking their cue from the federal government?
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.781]  Actually, from George Walker Bush.
[00:10:29.781 --> 00:10:45.504]  Well, it's just like, supposedly, 15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia, but we attacked their archenemy, Iraq,
[00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:59.138]  And then overthrew the government and have armed now Saudi Arabian backed Al Qaeda Wahhabist from Saudi Arabia to take it over.
[00:10:59.138 --> 00:11:09.785]  So I guess actually they're not taking a total cue from the federal government where Saudi Arabia attacks us so we attack Saudi Arabia's enemy and blame them for it.
[00:11:09.785 --> 00:11:15.969]  This is where the cops reportedly shoot an innocent person and then the people burn down part of their own neighborhood.
[00:11:18.752 --> 00:11:28.935]  Because to actually mimic our government, the blacks would protest a fellow black person being killed in cold blood by shooting a bunch of innocent blacks.
[00:11:28.935 --> 00:11:31.515]  Because that's kind of what happened with 9-11.
[00:11:31.515 --> 00:11:35.216]  If you believe the official story, Saudi Arabia was involved.
[00:11:35.216 --> 00:11:37.177]  Clearly they were at some level.
[00:11:37.177 --> 00:11:40.317]  And so you attack the country that was not involved.
[00:11:40.317 --> 00:11:42.458]  So actually that's not a fair analogy, is it?
[00:11:43.353 --> 00:11:45.153]  Because the blacks in St.
[00:11:45.153 --> 00:11:52.595]  Louis and in Ferguson would have to just randomly kill black people.
[00:11:52.595 --> 00:11:53.955]  And they'd have to kill about 1,500,000.
[00:11:53.955 --> 00:12:06.338]  I keep using the million number, that was from the sanctions and the first year of the war, from 1990 to 2007 it was over a million.
[00:12:06.338 --> 00:12:10.419]  According to the British Medical Journal that did the analysis, the Lancet,
[00:12:12.122 --> 00:12:13.723]  And others did breakdowns.
[00:12:13.723 --> 00:12:16.244]  It's about a million and a half now.
[00:12:16.244 --> 00:12:22.488]  So, actually, you know, you'd have to kill, I guess, every black person in St.
[00:12:22.488 --> 00:12:24.729]  Louis to make it something comparable.
[00:12:24.729 --> 00:12:27.190]  Kill, you know, 50, 100,000 black people.
[00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:39.717]  They'd have to kill 50, 100,000 of their own people to actually be as cockamamie and crazy and off the wall as the propaganda that we accept in this country.
[00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:49.360]  And if you're having trouble wrapping your mind around that gibberish that I just spent four minutes putting out, hey, don't blame me.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:57.283]  I'm putting out the twisted, backwards, upside down, bizarro world, satanic logic of the globalist.
[00:12:57.283 --> 00:13:07.348]  Of course, there's really no logic at all except destabilization and power grabbing.
[00:13:07.348 --> 00:13:08.068]  That's what's happening.
[00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:39.939]  Because our government, for four years basically, has been, I keep saying three years, it's about four years now, has been funding Al-Qaeda rebels in Libya and in Egypt and in Iraq and in Syria to take over areas, build a command base, to then threaten the West with all the Stinger missiles they've got, so they can then set up police states in the Western world to counter the people that publicly work for them.
[00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:48.558]  And again, where's the logic of that?
[00:13:48.558 --> 00:14:04.087]  The federal government, the CIA, publicly, publicly, funded Al Qaeda to go in and take over Libya.
[00:14:04.087 --> 00:14:06.008]  They did the same thing in a whole bunch of other countries.
[00:14:08.672 --> 00:14:15.054]  And now they're acting like they don't know why ISIS is running wild trying to take over Kurdish areas where they're not supposed to be.
[00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:18.155]  See, they're painting outside the lines.
[00:14:18.155 --> 00:14:20.155]  They're not painting by the numbers.
[00:14:20.155 --> 00:14:30.838]  So they've all got to be bombed to go back into the areas where they're allowed to be forming their new state out of western Iraq into eastern Syria.
[00:14:33.007 --> 00:14:43.475]  And I know I talk a lot about this because it's an unfolding tragedy, and it's a war crime, because it's bigger than just what's happening with Al Qaeda.
[00:14:43.475 --> 00:14:57.627]  It's an illustration of everything the globalists do, where they create the crisis, create the terror group, turn them loose, and then let them basically take over society, and then pose as saviors to then counter them.
[00:15:02.344 --> 00:15:09.448]  So we're going to look back at the BART police shooting of Oscar Grant where the police said that he had assaulted them.
[00:15:09.448 --> 00:15:12.350]  They had video of it, but the truth is he didn't resist.
[00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:17.593]  They put him down on his stomach and shot him through the back through his heart.
[00:15:17.593 --> 00:15:25.717]  And then they tried to grab everybody's cell phones so that no one could document it.
[00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:30.280]  The trouble was someone hid behind a seat in a train
[00:15:31.792 --> 00:15:37.918]  And got the execution on video.
[00:15:37.918 --> 00:15:53.452]  And it doesn't matter if you're a poor white Appalachian, white, or a poor inner city black, the attitude is you can basically be executed and nobody gets in trouble.
[00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.415]  And more and more the police are being turned into a paramilitary.
[00:15:58.069 --> 00:16:02.972]  To basically wage war on who they've been trained their enemy is, and that's the American people.
[00:16:02.972 --> 00:16:12.497]  Now a lot of departments have resisted this, but a lot of departments have succumbed to it.
[00:16:12.497 --> 00:16:18.380]  And everyone needs to understand that when they're done setting the precedent on poor people of getting away with this,
[00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:28.913]  It's going to be moved against the real target, gun owners, returning veterans, veterans, libertarians, Christians, conservatives.
[00:16:28.913 --> 00:16:32.814]  Because that's who this is really being prepared for.
[00:16:32.814 --> 00:16:35.574]  And I always told you that and now it's public.
[00:16:35.574 --> 00:16:36.915]  Obama said two days ago,
[00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:48.083]  On Sunday, in a New York Times article, that the main threat is conservatives and the fact that we won't compromise and that we've radicalized the media.
[00:16:48.083 --> 00:16:52.444]  When he says conservatives, he says the radicals that have taken it over, the Tea Party.
[00:16:52.444 --> 00:17:03.747]  That's the libertarian 1776ers who understand the battle space, understand the game, understand what's being done, understand the big picture.
[00:17:03.747 --> 00:17:04.667]  Of course we're the enemy.
[00:17:06.479 --> 00:17:25.292]  Because we know the globalists, we know their game plan, we study them and we want prosperity, we want stability, we want the police to be constitutional and respected and to be guardians with the people of society, locally controlled.
[00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:31.997]  We want the citizens to have jobs and prosperity and have an age of chivalry, return and a new renaissance.
[00:17:32.776 --> 00:17:42.662]  We want to have a nation of quality and honor, a nation of strong male and female role models and strong families.
[00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:44.523]  We want what works.
[00:17:44.523 --> 00:17:51.768]  And the globalists have infected society with cultural, psychological warfare viruses on record.
[00:17:53.933 --> 00:17:58.917]  To break up the family, to degenerate art and society, it's all been declassified.
[00:17:58.917 --> 00:18:03.500]  Just type in CIA, put out deviant art and pornography.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.202]  And promoted the legalization of hardcore pornography.
[00:18:06.202 --> 00:18:09.985]  And I'm not up here on some high horse saying, you know, that I haven't been around the block.
[00:18:09.985 --> 00:18:12.587]  The whole point is, is that we know where this all came from.
[00:18:15.356 --> 00:18:23.121]  To sear the conscience, so that when real things are going on that are bad, we are so desensitized, we don't get up and resist it.
[00:18:23.121 --> 00:18:40.390]  I talk a lot about my grandfather, who was in two tours in World War II, one in aircraft, and after he was done with his missions, on the ground, in Italy, and then in Germany, and saw starving children, piles of dead bodies, the whole nine yards.
[00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.493]  He was a man's man, very popular, elected into government,
[00:18:46.223 --> 00:19:07.439]  But he would not watch violent television or violent movies and it wasn't because he couldn't handle it, it was because it was insulting to have seen a lot of real dead people and a lot of dead buddies and a lot of starving children and then to see it turned into a joke on television.
[00:19:11.772 --> 00:19:16.714]  He wouldn't let my dad and his brother go, go see violent films.
[00:19:16.714 --> 00:19:20.516]  And if they were in a violent film, he'd get up and take them out of it.
[00:19:20.516 --> 00:19:23.697]  And it wasn't because he was a wimp.
[00:19:23.697 --> 00:19:32.161]  Yeah, he'd been a boxer and then had been put in a military academy and everything else before he even was sent off the Army Air Corps.
[00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:34.962]  But he, he, he understood it was offensive.
[00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:45.697]  Because the image of violence, the image of sex, all it does, and the studies show this, is desensitize you from the real thing.
[00:19:45.697 --> 00:19:53.964]  It ruins real sex for you, and then it desensitizes violence where you don't care about your neighbor getting killed or drug off.
[00:19:53.964 --> 00:19:57.107]  You already saw that on television a thousand times last month.
[00:19:57.107 --> 00:19:58.008]  It's brainwashing.
[00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:04.505]  It seems that everywhere you turn to these days, people are talking about the health benefits of silver.
[00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:07.647]  But don't be fooled into believing all silver is the same.
[00:20:07.647 --> 00:20:13.791]  Only one silver solution has been clinically shown to be hundreds of times stronger than colloidal or ionic silver.
[00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:15.993]  That's supernatural silver.
[00:20:15.993 --> 00:20:21.057]  It can be used internally as a powerful immune system enhancer to fight off bacteria and viruses.
[00:20:21.057 --> 00:20:25.420]  Supernatural silver can be used topically to treat any type of wound or skin issue.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.461]  It's even gentle enough to be used on the ears, eyes, and sinuses.
[00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:34.302]  And unlike harsh drugs and antibiotics, Supernatural Silver has no side effects.
[00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:39.144]  Available as a liquid or a gel that you can use every day to stay healthy and well.

[00:20:58.912 --> 00:21:02.936]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:21:02.936 --> 00:21:07.259]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:21:07.259 --> 00:21:10.902]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:13.945]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:21:13.945 --> 00:21:21.111]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:25.313]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:21:25.313 --> 00:21:29.696]  New filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:21:29.696 --> 00:21:35.599]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:39.521]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:21:39.521 --> 00:21:42.242]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:21:42.242 --> 00:21:43.583]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:21:43.723 --> 00:21:45.065]  It's time to take action.
[00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:46.907]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:05.126]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:05.126 --> 00:22:13.253]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:13.253 --> 00:22:21.100]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.504]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:26.504 --> 00:22:31.727]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:31.727 --> 00:22:36.070]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.151]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:41.674]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:41.674 --> 00:22:46.578]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:46.578 --> 00:22:49.080]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:58.906 --> 00:23:00.487]  Time and time again.
[00:23:00.487 --> 00:23:03.409]  You need to come here and help us.
[00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:04.870]  We need assistance.
[00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:05.691]  Please!
[00:23:05.691 --> 00:23:09.013]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:15.678]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:23:15.678 --> 00:23:18.199]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:23:18.199 --> 00:23:19.180]  Take action now.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.824]  So that you're prepared for the next disaster with MyPatriotsupply.com.

[00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:50.132]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.

[00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:24.747]  Alright, we're gonna break down kill switches, not being just put into cell phones, but into all electronics, to surveil you and your family on record.
[00:24:25.786 --> 00:24:30.531]  And to be turned off during globalist takeovers.
[00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:41.521]  And I'm going to air a clip from television in 1997 where Charlton Heston narrates discussing PSYOPs against populations.
[00:24:41.521 --> 00:24:43.483]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:43.483 --> 00:24:50.629]  We'll dovetail it with all of the latest economic and military news.
[00:24:50.629 --> 00:24:51.230]  This morning
[00:24:56.050 --> 00:25:19.352]  I got physically angry and I was very happy that I had the emotional response of becoming nauseous at the thought and at first having a feeling of powerlessness because that was my brain trying to figure out how to get out of it.
[00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:21.491]  How to defeat it.
[00:25:21.491 --> 00:25:23.932]  How to gain power over it.
[00:25:23.932 --> 00:25:25.753]  How to protect the species.
[00:25:25.753 --> 00:25:29.954]  How to protect the continuity of the genetics.
[00:25:29.954 --> 00:25:39.057]  I had some friends over this morning for breakfast.
[00:25:39.057 --> 00:25:48.000]  And one of them was a former nanny to my children who is pregnant and getting married.
[00:25:49.872 --> 00:25:57.177]  A few people just dropped by for a 45 minute long breakfast.
[00:25:57.177 --> 00:26:10.206]  And even though I've known this person for about six years, and she's smart, she goes, well, we're gonna do some of the vaccines we think, but not all of them.
[00:26:10.206 --> 00:26:15.930]  And I sat back and got on the computer on a laptop and was showing her
[00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:26.839]  Mainline documents where there's cancer viruses in most of the vaccines, where polio actually gives people polio worldwide, mainstream headlines, but they call it paralysis.
[00:26:28.314 --> 00:26:38.396]  Where they shot black people up for 47 years and kept it secret with syphilis, and allowed them to spread it to hundreds of thousands of people, killing tens of thousands, and just well-known stuff.
[00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:40.157]  And she's like, oh, I did know about that.
[00:26:40.157 --> 00:26:43.297]  And I said, yeah, watch this news clip just from last week.
[00:26:43.297 --> 00:26:48.478]  I see one of these every few weeks without looking, and it's always a local newscast.
[00:26:48.478 --> 00:26:51.619]  It never makes it nationally.
[00:26:51.619 --> 00:26:55.660]  Where a 12 or 11 year old girl takes the Gardasil shot, the HPV,
[00:26:57.364 --> 00:26:58.084]  and dies.
[00:27:17.574 --> 00:27:19.155]  And so my head starts spinning.
[00:27:19.155 --> 00:27:20.676]  I want to get those videos again.
[00:27:20.676 --> 00:27:21.937]  I want to warn people.
[00:27:21.937 --> 00:27:30.442]  I get physically angry at a government lying and saying it's the law when there was no law, knowing it killed a bunch of people during the trials.
[00:27:30.442 --> 00:27:32.843]  Because that's what it has.
[00:27:32.843 --> 00:27:36.565]  I mean, to be able to sterilize you.
[00:27:36.565 --> 00:27:38.947]  A large portion of women that take it, of course, it attacks the ovaries.
[00:27:38.947 --> 00:27:43.049]  That's now been confirmed.
[00:27:43.049 --> 00:27:46.131]  For that to happen, sometimes it's going to have a bigger effect and kill you.
[00:27:51.249 --> 00:28:05.602]  And it just hit me how evil this system is, and the eugenicists, and all their documents, and eco-science, and all the admissions, and I had to sit there for 45 minutes and ruin what would have been a nice breakfast.
[00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:16.512]  As we sat there eating steak and eggs, and bell peppers and onions, just pulling stuff up, and then my buddy that came over,
[00:28:17.506 --> 00:28:20.308]  My personal trainer, he never even told me all this stuff.
[00:28:20.308 --> 00:28:29.494]  He goes, yeah, my cousin, you know, my aunt, total, natural, organic, homeschooled, kids never got sick, super healthy.
[00:28:29.494 --> 00:28:41.041]  Then he got into the Army Academy, gave a bunch of shots, six months in a coma, brain damage, has to take pills every day now from the shots the Army gave him, and they admit the shots did it.
[00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:50.907]  The other person that was there started talking about people they knew that had been damaged, and then my grandmother says she got polio, too, except for getting it.
[00:28:50.907 --> 00:28:53.030]  And has been on crutches ever since, is still alive at 89.
[00:28:55.146 --> 00:28:58.448]  I just realized I've become too comfortable with this.
[00:28:58.448 --> 00:29:01.929]  And the doctors are compartmentalized, the nurses are compartmentalized.
[00:29:01.929 --> 00:29:08.993]  I mean, I'm the one that broke that they're secretly taking blood at birth for 43 years.
[00:29:08.993 --> 00:29:12.134]  And by the way, when I say that, I don't get a thrill that I broke that.
[00:29:12.134 --> 00:29:14.956]  I get nauseous and angry like I'm caught
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:21.281]  In a dog pile playing football with ten big guys on me, and I can't breathe and I can't get out of it.
[00:29:21.281 --> 00:29:23.761]  Because I know I've gotten out of stuff before.
[00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:25.962]  I've moved the world before.
[00:29:25.962 --> 00:29:29.022]  And I know I've got the power to reach out to you to move the lever.
[00:29:29.022 --> 00:29:33.743]  Because after that broke, there's been all these lawsuits, global phenomenon, it's now known.
[00:29:33.743 --> 00:29:41.744]  And I just know we can get the lever, and we can literally tear Grendel's arm out of the socket if we have the will.
[00:29:41.744 --> 00:29:44.085]  But the only reason I have the power is through you.
[00:29:44.085 --> 00:29:45.385]  And I'm saying,
[00:29:46.724 --> 00:29:47.907]  They're murdering us, folks.
[00:29:47.907 --> 00:29:48.628]  They're murderers.
[00:29:48.628 --> 00:29:49.390]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.031]  Understand that.
[00:29:50.031 --> 00:29:51.214]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.214 --> 00:29:51.655]  Understand that.
[00:29:51.655 --> 00:29:54.882]  I mean, there's no point in imagining you're part of the system.
[00:29:54.882 --> 00:29:55.764]  You're not.
[00:29:55.764 --> 00:29:56.686]  It wants to kill you.
[00:29:59.383 --> 00:30:01.764]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:01.764 --> 00:30:04.605]  The latest in preparedness is now here.

[00:30:55.526 --> 00:31:05.893]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:31:05.893 --> 00:31:09.316]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:31:09.316 --> 00:31:10.977]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[00:31:10.977 --> 00:31:17.341]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:17.341 --> 00:31:23.205]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:31:23.385 --> 00:31:27.326]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:31:27.326 --> 00:31:30.407]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:31:30.407 --> 00:31:38.689]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:31:38.689 --> 00:31:40.770]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:41.830]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:51.133]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:32:00.213 --> 00:32:02.515]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:32:02.515 --> 00:32:09.959]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:20.767]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:32:20.767 --> 00:32:30.013]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:32:30.753 --> 00:32:34.817]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:32:34.817 --> 00:32:38.560]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.622]  Experience the new formula.
[00:32:40.622 --> 00:32:43.204]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:32:43.204 --> 00:32:44.545]  Shield your family.
[00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:46.367]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:32:46.367 --> 00:32:49.509]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:53.473]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:33:01.736 --> 00:33:03.156]  I'll show you politics in America.
[00:33:03.156 --> 00:33:05.617]  Here it is, right here.
[00:33:05.617 --> 00:33:08.318]  I think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs.
[00:33:08.318 --> 00:33:12.939]  I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking.
[00:33:12.939 --> 00:33:13.639]  Hey, wait a minute.
[00:33:13.639 --> 00:33:15.499]  There's one guy holding up both puppets.
[00:33:15.499 --> 00:33:16.759]  Shut up!
[00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:18.160]  Go back to bed, America.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.721]  Your government is in control.
[00:33:21.721 --> 00:33:26.602]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:26.602 --> 00:33:28.022]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.755 --> 00:33:31.516]  I want to try to tie everything here together.
[00:33:31.516 --> 00:33:36.619]  I haven't talked about Robin Williams' death yet.
[00:33:36.619 --> 00:33:37.619]  I like Robin Williams.
[00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:40.021]  I thought he was a great actor.
[00:33:40.021 --> 00:33:45.444]  And I'm sad that it looks like he committed suicide by hanging.
[00:33:45.444 --> 00:33:47.645]  But then I look at the headlines.
[00:33:47.645 --> 00:33:51.887]  Report Robin Williams had serious money troubles.
[00:33:51.887 --> 00:33:54.609]  This is a guy that made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:33:54.609 --> 00:33:57.710]  And he was worried about faltering career.
[00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:58.431]  Fox News.
[00:34:01.736 --> 00:34:13.640]  And I think about that.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:21.882]  If Robin Williams would have been more worried about helping other people.
[00:34:21.882 --> 00:34:24.443]  If Robin Williams would have been more worried about
[00:34:25.353 --> 00:34:32.237]  Discovering the wonders of the universe and loving his friends and family.
[00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:38.960]  And not been depressed about a faltering career and money troubles.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.241]  He would probably be alive today.
[00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:45.203]  And I don't fault him for committing suicide, that's his business.
[00:34:45.203 --> 00:34:50.426]  And I don't speak ill of the dead if they've not been a rapacious person.
[00:34:54.835 --> 00:35:02.502]  But Robin Williams clearly went along with the establishment line.
[00:35:02.502 --> 00:35:08.408]  And Robin Williams was obviously a worldly person.
[00:35:08.408 --> 00:35:11.751]  And it shows.
[00:35:11.751 --> 00:35:17.096]  I would understand someone committing suicide if they had incredibly painful bone cancer.
[00:35:17.096 --> 00:35:19.438]  And if they just started taking enough morphine to fade off.
[00:35:22.509 --> 00:35:33.852]  I don't think the state should be involved in that, though, because then they'll start killing people that are healthy, which has already begun in Northern and Western Europe.
[00:35:33.852 --> 00:35:40.093]  But I think about the Hollywood people that I've known.
[00:35:40.093 --> 00:35:43.674]  On average, they are completely and absolutely unhappy.
[00:35:46.462 --> 00:36:01.687]  Despite the fact they own private jets, date the most beautiful women, and have the world at their feet, they are some of the most empty, unhappy people you will ever know.
[00:36:01.687 --> 00:36:08.308]  The only people I know that are celebrities that are happy are people that have moved out of L.A.
[00:36:08.308 --> 00:36:11.890]  and don't want anything to do with it.
[00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.070]  Mike Judge is a happy guy.
[00:36:13.885 --> 00:36:19.648]  But he's an engineer and loves comedy, and just loves to go listen to good music and have fun.
[00:36:19.648 --> 00:36:22.470]  And he's totally down to earth, and he's a producer.
[00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.773]  And made more than a billion dollars.
[00:36:26.773 --> 00:36:27.853]  By the way, Mike's in town.
[00:36:27.853 --> 00:36:32.176]  I just was too tired last night to go out, but I might go out tonight.
[00:36:32.176 --> 00:36:32.996]  I need to give him a call.
[00:36:32.996 --> 00:36:39.420]  I'm not name-dropping, I'm just giving you an example.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.801]  Silicon Valley, King of the Hill.
[00:36:44.426 --> 00:36:46.367]  Office space movies like that.
[00:36:46.367 --> 00:36:52.609]  Jesse Ventura overall is a happy guy, because he likes to exercise, likes to fish, likes to take care of his family, likes to golf.
[00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:58.451]  He'd care less about being a celebrity.
[00:36:58.451 --> 00:37:05.973]  And I guess I've known a few other people, but those are names I can't mention on air that are celebrities and are happy.
[00:37:05.973 --> 00:37:12.035]  But you look at consciousness itself and the fact that we can see beauty and share beauty with others.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:19.621]  And all the studies show it, helping others, teaching others.
[00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:24.882]  There's more than one way to live forever.
[00:37:24.882 --> 00:37:31.704]  We're told there's immortality and we're told there is replication.
[00:37:31.704 --> 00:37:38.825]  And the only form of immortality that we know for 100% fact we have is replication.
[00:37:38.825 --> 00:37:43.346]  But we know pure replication always leads into errors and stagnation.
[00:37:47.697 --> 00:38:12.396]  And so that's why in a competition-based system, in the species, males and females compete in art, in literature, in physical prowess, in beauty, in physical accumulation, to heighten the development of genetic models that build and complement the species.
[00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:41.898]  The globalist model though is one of physically trying to go into the DNA and the mitochondrial DNA and irrevocably mutating and sabotaging it to cause degenerative mutations and to not even cause mutations that statistically are known to create traits that could be desirable or desirous.
[00:38:43.775 --> 00:38:54.998]  Like the mutation of the Ice Age humanoid homo sapien sapien that you're looking at on your television screen right now.
[00:38:54.998 --> 00:39:06.421]  That would be culturally worldwide desirous.
[00:39:06.421 --> 00:39:08.122]  And why do I speak about these things?
[00:39:10.868 --> 00:39:19.310]  Because if you don't look at the world through the perspective of the technocrats, you are living in a matrix.
[00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.331]  And that's what I'm here to tell you.
[00:39:21.331 --> 00:39:29.393]  All this other news is simply a facade within the continuum of the manipulation.
[00:39:30.629 --> 00:39:44.177]  And the public is now awake to the fact that there is a manipulation and social engineering going on, but they're not awake to what the social engineering is trying to do.
[00:39:44.177 --> 00:39:48.859]  And this morning, I call it a flashback, but it's not really that.
[00:39:48.859 --> 00:39:59.425]  It's bringing up the data, the legions of examples of premeditated, admitted, ongoing, current, and past.
[00:40:02.503 --> 00:40:26.164]  Testing of degenerative and even lethal chemical, biological, radiological, nanotech programming into humanity in an ongoing total assault and we have all the metric graphs to show the devastation
[00:40:27.486 --> 00:40:29.027]  That it is causing.
[00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:55.678]  And to know that we're all part of an experiment by a super elite to develop life extension technologies for themselves, but to also decide which way they want to mutate, whether it will be biological, electrochemical, or purely silicon, or an augmented meshing of the silicon with the electrochemical biological species.
[00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:05.608]  And that's why I drive up to a checkpoint with cops in riot gear.
[00:41:05.608 --> 00:41:11.354]  I mean, it might as well be pygmies, you know, playing with their tallywhackers.
[00:41:11.354 --> 00:41:19.862]  I mean, I just... I am from the perspective of the technocrats, except I don't want to hurt them.
[00:41:19.862 --> 00:41:24.347]  I see how they're being manipulated following a programming system.
[00:41:28.314 --> 00:41:30.696]  I see how the public's being manipulated.
[00:41:30.696 --> 00:41:34.158]  I see all the different angles.
[00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:42.023]  And I simply want the public to not believe me, but to take the red pill, step back, and see it for themselves, and then it's all a joke.
[00:41:42.023 --> 00:41:53.110]  But to even communicate with the public, I've got to go in and model things, and cover news, most of the time, from a substrata.
[00:41:55.689 --> 00:41:59.652]  Of the controlled paradigm to even try to get through to someone.
[00:41:59.652 --> 00:42:06.897]  It's like going into the Matrix, jacking in and telling Neo in the first 10 minutes of the film, this is all fake.
[00:42:06.897 --> 00:42:08.277]  I can't really explain it to you.
[00:42:08.277 --> 00:42:10.299]  You need to take this red pill.
[00:42:10.299 --> 00:42:13.281]  But remember, this is going to freak you out.
[00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:16.843]  And all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[00:42:16.843 --> 00:42:20.706]  But it is within that great truth coming out of Plato's cave.
[00:42:21.684 --> 00:42:40.710]  The allegory of the cave that you are alive and that your consciousness and your awareness flowers into a fractal paradigm of expanded understanding that is limitless.
[00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:47.232]  And then you come face to face with the realization that the elite
[00:42:51.969 --> 00:43:01.679]  Are 100% on this page, but have made the decision to wall off 99 plus percent of the public.
[00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:04.602]  And that they are on a power trip.
[00:43:04.602 --> 00:43:09.267]  Because even though they're intellectually smart and scientifically smart, they don't have heart.
[00:43:09.267 --> 00:43:11.609]  They don't have soul.
[00:43:11.609 --> 00:43:12.530]  They are so wicked.
[00:43:18.339 --> 00:43:41.572]  That it seems to them the evil course is the surest course and you can clearly see out a few hundred steps that there's no way they're ever going to get out of this or be successful with the wavelength paradigm spirit that they have released.
[00:43:41.572 --> 00:43:44.034]  The spirit, the wavelength, the
[00:43:46.547 --> 00:44:02.618]  The spirit of the age, the essence of the technology they're using, the cultural twisted mathematics, is a virus that will not build what they tell themselves they're building.
[00:44:02.618 --> 00:44:10.383]  It's building a nightmare.
[00:44:10.383 --> 00:44:13.846]  And then it hit me, the conspiracy, the criminal
[00:44:15.805 --> 00:44:39.358]  Racketeering of the state of Texas in 19, in 2007, 2006 in the Gardasil HPV trials with Merck and all the deaths and autoimmune disorders and sterilization that was happening
[00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:44.493]  It was in the journals, in the local news.
[00:44:44.493 --> 00:44:49.837]  Their answer was to triple down and to come out and say, it's the law.
[00:44:49.837 --> 00:44:55.581]  You've got to take this vaccine or mothers, you'll be arrested.
[00:44:55.581 --> 00:44:58.523]  Your daughters won't get cancer.
[00:44:58.523 --> 00:45:05.288]  Even though the cancer is extremely rare, the vaccine insert says it doesn't protect you.
[00:45:05.288 --> 00:45:09.691]  And we knew it was going to be linked to sterilization because it had already done that in a lot of the trials.
[00:45:10.777 --> 00:45:18.983]  And they went on the air and said it was the law and ran TV ads, which became the model in India and Mexico and everywhere else.
[00:45:18.983 --> 00:45:27.190]  And everywhere after the first few rounds there, they outlawed it in India, because they went and studied it in local news and national news said, no, it's a sterilant.
[00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.291]  And the government got in trouble for that over there.
[00:45:29.291 --> 00:45:31.473]  I mean, it's admitted what it's doing.
[00:45:31.473 --> 00:45:38.338]  And then I've got to sit there with someone that's known me for six years and convince them not to take it or not to give it to their child.
[00:45:39.195 --> 00:45:48.761]  And now they're giving it to little boys.
[00:45:48.761 --> 00:45:53.424]  And it just shows how deep we are in this whole thing.
[00:45:53.424 --> 00:45:59.088]  The cops give it to their kids, the bureaucrats give it to them, the FBI agents go give it to their daughters.
[00:46:00.506 --> 00:46:02.407]  And you all think you're part of the power structure.
[00:46:02.407 --> 00:46:04.309]  You're being murdered on record.
[00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:05.770]  It's like fluoride.
[00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:08.152]  It's in thousands of studies.
[00:46:08.152 --> 00:46:10.093]  26 studies looked at by Harvard in 2012.
[00:46:10.093 --> 00:46:20.422]  Just type in Harvard study fluoride, where if you drink it for a couple years, when you're a child, it lowers your IQ more than 10 points.
[00:46:20.422 --> 00:46:24.965]  And it gives you a seven-fold increase in bone cancer and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:46:24.965 --> 00:46:28.128]  Adrenal failure, kidney failure, liver cancer.
[00:46:28.128 --> 00:46:29.629]  I mean, my God!
[00:46:30.732 --> 00:46:35.816]  Absolute fact!
[00:46:35.816 --> 00:46:48.805]  And so I don't know to laugh or cry when some bureaucrat comes banging on our door and says, I'm from the state, I'm here to inspect your office for this or that, and is on a power trip.
[00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:52.648]  I mean, I'm literally looking at a brain damaged creature.
[00:46:53.735 --> 00:47:06.321]  Brought up on television their whole life on a petty power trip, who drank fluoride their whole life, and just wants a bigger truck or a fancier house or, you know, operates at an animal level of hating their supervisor.
[00:47:06.321 --> 00:47:15.265]  And I'm sitting there on a whole nother level, not on a power trip, in sadness at a wrecked creature.
[00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:21.688]  Realizing, though, that it is a piranha and a servant of the system that destroyed them,
[00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:29.674]  And shuttered the doors of perception and their consciousness.
[00:47:29.674 --> 00:47:37.658]  I mean, I've seen hundreds of local newscasts in the last seven, eight years, nine years with Gardasil.
[00:47:37.658 --> 00:47:38.619]  Hundreds.
[00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:40.479]  We've aired probably 50 of them here.
[00:47:40.479 --> 00:47:50.084]  And to the point that I'm conditioned to where I don't even get upset about it anymore and don't even talk about it when Rob Duke goes, look, another girl died from Gardasil.
[00:47:51.294 --> 00:47:53.256]  Sometimes the doctors admit, oh yeah, you had a bad reaction.
[00:47:53.256 --> 00:48:00.345]  Other times they go, oh, we don't know why we gave it to you and you died in the clinic or died in the car on the way home or died the next day.
[00:48:00.345 --> 00:48:07.794]  And then, of course, this sudden death, infant syndrome, they've confirmed in Australia and Japan.
[00:48:08.783 --> 00:48:12.146]  That's why they don't give baby shots before 18 months in Japan.
[00:48:12.146 --> 00:48:24.735]  That you give a baby, you know, a few dozen shots, they have an autoimmune response, they have an aneurysm, their brain bleeds, and you come in and baby's in a coma and then baby dies.
[00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:27.658]  It was only meant to brain damage your child.
[00:48:27.658 --> 00:48:30.880]  So they would be one of these zombies.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:36.625]  But, you know, to be strong enough to do that, especially with little boys, little boys aren't as strong as little girls,
[00:48:37.691 --> 00:48:46.238]  That's the same in all mammal species, from whales to rhesus monkeys to homo sapiens sapien.
[00:48:46.238 --> 00:48:48.240]  Girls are more hardy.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:52.023]  That's a genetic design to be able to handle childbirth.
[00:48:52.023 --> 00:48:53.964]  Any medical doctor will tell you that.
[00:48:53.964 --> 00:49:02.071]  You go on your little boy, he's got blood coming out his nose, and the police officers are going to take you to jail and indict you.
[00:49:02.071 --> 00:49:05.594]  Because the state, the cops don't know that they were murdered by the state.
[00:49:06.772 --> 00:49:15.199]  And the cops see a little baby with blood coming out of it's nose, and the hospital's going to say that you shook your baby.
[00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:27.548]  Because you see, if that lie falls, if we admit the fluoride's hurting us, if we admit the shots are designed to brain damage us, then all the rest of it caves in, see?
[00:49:27.548 --> 00:49:29.430]  So they have to say you shook your baby.
[00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:38.574]  They only admit it when your child dies at the doctor or on the way home or is old enough to where they can't blame you.
[00:49:38.574 --> 00:49:41.195]  Let's go to a short clip from a local news piece.
[00:49:41.195 --> 00:49:45.699]  This is up on Infowars.com from Wisconsin WTMJ.
[00:49:45.699 --> 00:49:48.421]  And you see the image, this little 12-year-old girl.
[00:49:48.421 --> 00:49:49.982]  She doesn't get to get married.
[00:49:49.982 --> 00:49:50.983]  She doesn't get to have kids.
[00:49:50.983 --> 00:49:52.584]  She doesn't get to go to Cancun.
[00:49:52.584 --> 00:49:56.046]  She doesn't get to see the stars at night that are big and bright.
[00:49:56.046 --> 00:49:57.067]  She's dead now.
[00:49:57.067 --> 00:49:57.808]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:49:58.416 --> 00:50:03.260]  So what caused the 12-year-old's life to be cut so tragically short?
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:07.723]  A few hours before she died, Meredith was complaining of a sore throat.
[00:50:07.723 --> 00:50:09.484]  Her mom took her to the doctor.
[00:50:09.484 --> 00:50:14.528]  While there, the 12-year-old also got the first round of the HPV vaccine.
[00:50:14.528 --> 00:50:21.693]  When I came home, she had just grown up and was non-responsive on my living room floor.
[00:50:21.693 --> 00:50:23.815]  I performed CPR.
[00:50:23.815 --> 00:50:27.638]  She was taken to Waukesha Memorial, where she died.
[00:50:29.935 --> 00:50:34.318]  And by the way, until six years ago, pregnant women were never supposed to take shots.
[00:50:34.318 --> 00:50:35.638]  Any doctor will tell you that.
[00:50:35.638 --> 00:50:38.100]  They knew that it caused all sorts of problems.
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:41.682]  And until six years ago, you never gave someone that was already sick a vaccine.
[00:50:41.682 --> 00:50:48.826]  It was well known to cause autoimmune problems and brainstem death.
[00:50:48.826 --> 00:50:51.027]  Probably what happened to her.
[00:50:51.027 --> 00:50:55.930]  And women will still take their daughters in for execution.
[00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:57.491]  So just remember, you've been warned.
[00:50:57.491 --> 00:50:58.412]  You understand?
[00:50:59.867 --> 00:51:04.210]  Are you happy doing your laundry with perfume detergents that irritate your skin?
[00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:08.952]  Are you happy washing your hands with stinking fragrances that gives your skin rashes?
[00:51:08.952 --> 00:51:13.035]  Are you happy paying new higher prices for smaller boxes?

[00:51:51.629 --> 00:51:52.550]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[00:51:58.855 --> 00:52:06.063]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:52:06.063 --> 00:52:08.425]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:13.730]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:18.936]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:52:18.936 --> 00:52:22.019]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:52:22.299 --> 00:52:26.381]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:52:26.381 --> 00:52:30.762]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:52:30.762 --> 00:52:41.047]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:52:41.047 --> 00:52:51.891]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.822]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[00:53:01.822 --> 00:53:05.145]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[00:53:05.145 --> 00:53:07.888]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[00:53:07.888 --> 00:53:11.851]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[00:53:11.851 --> 00:53:15.615]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[00:53:15.615 --> 00:53:17.016]  Ours is not immune.
[00:53:17.016 --> 00:53:18.677]  The time is now to be proactive.
[00:53:18.677 --> 00:53:19.258]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:53:23.982 --> 00:53:26.704]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[00:53:26.704 --> 00:53:32.308]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it, so decide.
[00:53:32.308 --> 00:53:35.631]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[00:53:35.631 --> 00:53:36.932]  The choice is yours.
[00:53:36.932 --> 00:53:38.073]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:53:38.073 --> 00:53:39.174]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:40.195]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[00:53:40.195 --> 00:53:40.355]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[00:53:54.225 --> 00:53:54.786]  Extension 116.
[00:54:23.274 --> 00:54:23.995]  One man dies.
[00:54:23.995 --> 00:54:25.015]  It's a tragedy.
[00:54:25.015 --> 00:54:25.576]  10,000 die.
[00:54:25.576 --> 00:54:28.138]  It's a statistic, Joseph Stalin.
[00:54:28.138 --> 00:54:37.164]  Robin Williams dies and the whole world mourns a man who was super rich and powerful and successful and had a long life.
[00:54:37.164 --> 00:54:42.508]  But will anybody mourn for the 12-year-old girl?
[00:54:42.508 --> 00:54:46.291]  Meredith had a zest for life and it showed in her pictures.
[00:54:46.291 --> 00:54:47.892]  She was active and healthy.
[00:54:47.892 --> 00:54:52.536]  But now her family is trying to figure out what tragically cut their daughter's life short.
[00:54:55.023 --> 00:55:07.896]  And for every story of a death, there's hundreds of the wheelchairs and the blood pouring out from the sexual organ and from the eyeballs.
[00:55:07.896 --> 00:55:15.864]  And it doesn't matter how many people die, how many get sterilized, or how many foreign countries ban Gardasil.
[00:55:15.864 --> 00:55:17.786]  America will take it!
[00:55:19.346 --> 00:55:23.948]  Because the high priest up on the mountain said, you must do it, the medical doctor.
[00:55:23.948 --> 00:55:27.470]  And the medical doctors can never admit this is happening.
[00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:30.272]  Because then what does it say about their whole profession?
[00:55:30.272 --> 00:55:32.233]  That they're just big pharma pushers.
[00:55:32.233 --> 00:55:38.456]  Oh, and who set up big pharma in the last hundred years in Germany, in England, in the United States?
[00:55:38.456 --> 00:55:42.278]  Who set it up?
[00:55:42.278 --> 00:55:45.139]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute?
[00:55:45.139 --> 00:55:46.620]  The Rockefellers?
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.141]  Who literally set up Hitler?
[00:55:50.342 --> 00:55:54.426]  Hitler had a plan that was the apple of British intelligence eye.
[00:55:54.426 --> 00:56:01.052]  They weren't going to go into Africa and Latin America and everywhere and just kill everybody, the sub-humans as they called them.
[00:56:01.052 --> 00:56:10.520]  They were going to take over and then tank the food and tank the medicine to dumb the population down into an orderly extermination.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:16.426]  That's in Pulitzer Prize winning books, by the way, like Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and others.
[00:56:17.756 --> 00:56:19.636]  Because the Germans needed living space.
[00:56:19.636 --> 00:56:22.177]  I think you translate Lebensstrahl.
[00:56:22.177 --> 00:56:25.657]  Am I saying that wrong?
[00:56:25.657 --> 00:56:30.018]  See, it's not that I was crazy, like Narls Barkley says.
[00:56:30.018 --> 00:56:35.699]  It's that I knew too much.
[00:56:35.699 --> 00:56:37.839]  Meanwhile, are we fighting?
[00:56:37.839 --> 00:56:46.101]  You know, if black folks would have rioted in New York five, six years ago when it was in Newark Daily News that they were taking black kids from black women,
[00:56:46.994 --> 00:56:48.555]  They'd tell them, and then it was in the news.
[00:56:48.555 --> 00:56:52.937]  You want to keep your two-year-old, sign these forms, let us have your seven-year-old.
[00:56:52.937 --> 00:57:02.523]  And they'd take the little black kid and they'd strap him down and take a week to give him pesticide till they died in a big pharma test.
[00:57:02.523 --> 00:57:05.184]  You don't have any animal rights folks that are worried about kids, though.
[00:57:05.184 --> 00:57:07.886]  They're only worried about rats not being tested on.
[00:57:07.886 --> 00:57:11.408]  That's, you know, cause celeb for every young lady to be involved in.
[00:57:11.408 --> 00:57:14.409]  That's the, you know, trendy thing to do.
[00:57:15.526 --> 00:57:18.047]  Which I'm all for not having animal cruelty.
[00:57:18.047 --> 00:57:22.489]  But that was in New York Daily News.
[00:57:22.489 --> 00:57:25.970]  And no one got in trouble.
[00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:28.051]  Medical experiments on kids.
[00:57:28.051 --> 00:57:30.332]  They do it to poor whites too, but blacks are their favorites.
[00:57:30.332 --> 00:57:33.673]  Nobody listens to them.
[00:57:33.673 --> 00:57:38.495]  No, we're going to have a woman fired from Black Educators Association because she wasn't really black enough.
[00:57:38.495 --> 00:57:40.636]  That's in the Egan News today.
[00:57:43.951 --> 00:57:46.673]  See, you got the black folks worried about somebody not being black enough.
[00:57:46.673 --> 00:57:51.377]  But hey, some kid, you know, hundreds of thousands of Christians getting killed.
[00:57:51.377 --> 00:57:52.358]  Nobody worries about that.
[00:57:52.358 --> 00:57:53.419]  It's the Palestinians.
[00:57:53.419 --> 00:57:55.040]  Again, I'm sad for the Palestinians.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:58.483]  My point is, we're only told to debate about a thousand dead, not 200,000, 300,000 dead.
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.403]  This hour was brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com.

[00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:33.910]  Back to Brainwashing Special.
[00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:38.153]  To counter that, to fund the InfoWar, InfoWarStore.com.

[00:58:49.488 --> 00:58:53.310]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:54.551]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:58:54.551 --> 00:58:55.872]  God knows what's in this.
[00:58:55.872 --> 00:59:00.134]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:59:00.134 --> 00:59:05.858]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:59:06.018 --> 00:59:07.078]  That one is better.
[00:59:07.078 --> 00:59:08.319]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:09.739]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:59:09.739 --> 00:59:10.399]  It's good water.
[00:59:10.399 --> 00:59:16.381]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:59:16.381 --> 00:59:23.623]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:59:23.623 --> 00:59:26.324]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water.
[00:59:26.324 --> 00:59:34.246]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:59:34.386 --> 00:59:35.826]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:59:35.826 --> 00:59:36.607]  It's good water.
[00:59:36.607 --> 00:59:37.207]  Refreshing?
[00:59:37.207 --> 00:59:37.827]  It's good!

[00:59:45.049 --> 00:59:47.429]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.429 --> 00:59:53.111]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:10.214]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.214 --> 01:00:11.816]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:13.357]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.357 --> 01:00:17.561]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.561 --> 01:00:21.665]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.125 --> 01:00:34.507]  I haven't even gotten into the InfoWars.com news.
[01:00:34.507 --> 01:00:37.931]  It's all off the chart and important.
[01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:40.814]  And I haven't given the number out yet to take your phone calls.
[01:00:40.814 --> 01:00:46.439]  We have the owner of one of the shops joining us that's in the news.
[01:00:46.439 --> 01:00:53.787]  Has shops right in the middle of where everything got looted and burned down in a suburb of St.
[01:00:53.787 --> 01:00:55.448]  Louis, South St.
[01:00:55.448 --> 01:00:55.769]  Louis.
[01:00:57.912 --> 01:01:01.315]  But we're going to get County Guns LLC owner on.
[01:01:01.315 --> 01:01:07.160]  And of course it was in the local news, folks out front their businesses, they are 15s protecting them.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:15.967]  So that's very exciting to see the Second Amendment maintaining order when obviously the police can't.
[01:01:15.967 --> 01:01:25.996]  And I do think there should be more representative, you know, the fact that you're going to see this type of stuff happening when that area, that town of Ferguson is mainly black.
[01:01:27.063 --> 01:01:32.067]  And I think it's something like 80% of the police force is white.
[01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:40.574]  But then the argument is they've got all these drives nationwide to try to hire black officers, and I know that's true because I've looked at the statistics, and they just can't hire them.
[01:01:40.574 --> 01:01:44.317]  They just can't get enough folks to go try to get the job.
[01:01:44.317 --> 01:01:50.302]  But in my experience, I've seen just as much police brutality, black on black, as I've seen white on black.
[01:01:50.302 --> 01:01:51.543]  And the statistics show that.
[01:01:51.543 --> 01:01:52.804]  Again, statistics don't lie.
[01:01:53.729 --> 01:02:00.735]  Depending on the area of the country, it's between 5 and 12 times black-on-white crime.
[01:02:00.735 --> 01:02:03.838]  That's not an anti-black statement, it's just I'm telling you the fact.
[01:02:03.838 --> 01:02:07.141]  5 to 12 times black-on-white crime.
[01:02:07.141 --> 01:02:12.506]  And it's a similar number black-on-black.
[01:02:12.506 --> 01:02:15.749]  There's just an attitude, though, that, well, whites are inherently bad.
[01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:25.514]  I don't like one of the new Black Panther Party guys said down in Houston a few years ago to the news, don't rob and steal from black people, go do it to white crackers.
[01:02:25.514 --> 01:02:43.689]  I mean, most white crackers, cracker asses, are just like black folks, working two, three jobs and getting some kind of assistance on the side because they can't make it and their kids are going to juvenile because they got caught with marijuana and, you know, I mean, I mean, hell.
[01:02:44.758 --> 01:02:52.180]  That half the people I see walking around are a black guy with a Hispanic lady, or a white woman with a black guy, or a white guy with a Hispanic lady.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:03:00.563]  I mean, quite frankly, everybody's getting along pretty good, except for the media trying to create all this racial division.
[01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:02.083]  And that's because that's all they've got, folks.
[01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:05.544]  They want to distract everybody with that.
[01:03:05.544 --> 01:03:07.725]  And I'm just sick of it.
[01:03:07.725 --> 01:03:10.186]  But it's mindless, idiotic tribalism.
[01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:17.632]  But I'm really sick of racist black people not knowing they're racist.
[01:03:17.632 --> 01:03:29.777]  On the news, Al Sharpton, it just goes on and on, where people feel like folks are racist against them, so it's okay for them to have this stereotypical attitude that white people don't like them, and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:03:31.991 --> 01:03:40.355]  Where you just see incredible statements of anti-white garbage across the board.
[01:03:40.355 --> 01:03:41.876]  And it's acceptable.
[01:03:41.876 --> 01:03:48.199]  And so, again, all through this guilt complex, government will oppress any group they can get away with.
[01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:55.103]  So you had a bunch of white people with black folks ending slavery and then trying to end all these other abuses.
[01:03:56.434 --> 01:04:23.968]  And then when the war is partially won against that, instead of people going, wow, there are a lot of good white folks that said no to this, all white people have been baptized in guilt and told they're all inherently bad, even if their grandfather got here, you know, in 1900 from Poland or Germany, where nobody ever had any black slaves, and they were slaves in Poland and slaves in Germany, indentured servants.
[01:04:23.968 --> 01:04:25.769]  Most of the white people in this country
[01:04:27.216 --> 01:04:29.337]  See, I know the economics of all this, so I refuse all the guilt.
[01:04:48.959 --> 01:04:49.841]  I'm just tired of it.
[01:04:49.841 --> 01:04:51.043]  I'm sick of it.
[01:04:51.043 --> 01:04:58.296]  Meanwhile, they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines, fluoride in the water, brain damaging everybody, killing people with Gardasil, and nobody wants to talk about it.
[01:05:00.018 --> 01:05:07.320]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[01:05:33.153 --> 01:05:37.435]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:37.435 --> 01:05:39.215]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:08:01.231 --> 01:08:04.014]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.014 --> 01:08:06.797]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.668 --> 01:08:24.731]  Alright, I want to break down the situation unfolding in South St.
[01:08:24.731 --> 01:08:29.534]  Louis and in other areas like Ferguson.
[01:08:29.534 --> 01:08:43.183]  The epicenter since a black 18-year-old teen, who from all indications looked like a pretty good guy, got shot and the police are saying that he basically attacked him in the police car and resisted.
[01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:53.536]  I mean the FBI shot one of the Boston bombing suspects friends in the back of the head and admitted he didn't resist and didn't have a weapon.
[01:08:53.536 --> 01:09:05.363]  So a precedent it appears could be getting set like we saw with the famous BART shooting of Oscar Grant where this happens or the crowd may be lying and
[01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:12.957]  At the same time, he could have assaulted the officer and then tried to get the gun like they're saying.
[01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:20.946]  We don't know the truth, but what I know is it's wrong to run around and burn down grocery stores and mini-marts, gas stations and people's houses.
[01:09:22.574 --> 01:09:22.934]  I don't think so.
[01:09:43.248 --> 01:10:09.314]  uh... preparing for civil unrest so they see this is a major hot spot we have a volunteer was actually on the fire department a firefighter who owns a gun shop he's a adam weinstein he owns county guns county guns dot com on facebook it's uh... county guns and he joins us because and we'll show some of these images of the tattoo parlor the gun shop and others in the shopping center
[01:10:10.219 --> 01:10:21.247]  That is right next door to businesses that were burned basically on both sides, but the looters didn't go over there where folks had AR-15s.
[01:10:25.683 --> 01:10:26.884]  So he joins us now.
[01:10:26.884 --> 01:10:29.706]  Now he's on call right now with the fire department.
[01:10:29.706 --> 01:10:30.907]  And there are fires and things.
[01:10:30.907 --> 01:10:32.508]  There was more rioting last night.
[01:10:32.508 --> 01:10:35.790]  So he may have to go at any time.
[01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:40.614]  Police have been trying to keep the media out, which is not a good sign.
[01:10:40.614 --> 01:10:41.555]  There's a lot going on.
[01:10:41.555 --> 01:10:46.858]  I've seen members of the city council having guns aimed at them by police for walking around with cameras.
[01:10:46.858 --> 01:10:47.399]  So I think that's
[01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:55.087]  Again, too big a show of force by police, but I guess their view is scare the public so the looting stops.
[01:10:55.087 --> 01:10:56.667]  Adam, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:58.988]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.008]  How you doing?
[01:11:00.008 --> 01:11:00.448]  Good.
[01:11:00.448 --> 01:11:12.031]  Break down what you've witnessed the last three days, four days, and give us the inside scoop on the fact that you guys were armed outside your businesses.
[01:11:12.031 --> 01:11:16.672]  Well, the first night, which I guess was, that would be Sunday,
[01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:29.017]  We were all basically at home listening to the radio and the television and hearing things progress after the young man was shot and killed.
[01:11:29.017 --> 01:11:38.462]  And we could tell that the looting and the crowd was was heading up West Morrison towards where our business was.
[01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:41.163]  So we all just kind of decided to head up there and
[01:11:42.116 --> 01:11:48.879]  Basically take a stand and let them know that that wasn't going to be tolerated at the strip mall where our business is located.
[01:11:51.451 --> 01:11:52.992]  Oh, by the way, let me just correct things.
[01:11:52.992 --> 01:11:55.294]  It's Adam Weinstein.
[01:11:55.294 --> 01:11:57.975]  I apologize for getting your name wrong, Adam.
[01:11:57.975 --> 01:11:59.316]  Describe the town.
[01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:01.538]  Describe the relations.
[01:12:01.538 --> 01:12:03.059]  I mean, start at the beginning for us.
[01:12:03.059 --> 01:12:12.825]  I mean, I want to give you the floor to break down as an eyewitness to what has really been going on in three days of rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, outside St.
[01:12:12.825 --> 01:12:13.405]  Louis.
[01:12:13.405 --> 01:12:16.747]  It's now obviously spread to other areas of South St.
[01:12:16.747 --> 01:12:18.028]  Louis last night.
[01:12:18.028 --> 01:12:19.009]  What have you been witnessing?
[01:12:20.339 --> 01:12:34.147]  Um, it was mainly the Sunday night where most of it happened and it was just crowds of people, angry people that felt it necessary to destroy their own neighborhood basically.
[01:12:34.147 --> 01:12:37.708]  They broke into and burned a quick trip.
[01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:53.479]  Several small businesses, shoe stores, tire and wheel place that had been in business for many years, a family-owned business, they smashed out the front windows and proceeded to load all of their merchandise into vehicles and drive off.
[01:12:53.479 --> 01:13:01.962]  They hit clothing stores, shoe stores, just anything, you know, opportunist kind of action.
[01:13:01.962 --> 01:13:07.184]  Over the next day after that, things calmed down as far as the looting and any violence.
[01:13:08.348 --> 01:13:17.152]  Police were kind of staging the first day and more reacting to what was going on, where the second day they were prepared and ready.
[01:13:17.152 --> 01:13:23.134]  And I believe that they tried to control it as much as they could.
[01:13:23.134 --> 01:13:28.537]  They did a pretty good job at showing restraint, trying not to escalate things.
[01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:36.120]  And the night, the main night that we were up there, about four stores up from ours, there's a Dollar General.
[01:13:36.949 --> 01:13:45.431]  And witnessed a large group of people, probably 50 or more people, smash out the front windows and start to loot.
[01:13:45.431 --> 01:13:46.511]  We stayed where we were at.
[01:13:46.511 --> 01:13:48.272]  We called the police.
[01:13:48.272 --> 01:13:50.932]  Obviously, they were quite busy that night.
[01:13:50.932 --> 01:13:52.073]  Took them a while to show up.
[01:13:52.073 --> 01:13:56.614]  By the time they did show up, the crowd had dispersed.
[01:13:56.614 --> 01:13:57.854]  They had left the scene.
[01:13:57.854 --> 01:14:02.075]  After that, the crowd returned and a few of them
[01:14:03.776 --> 01:14:08.300]  Uh, broke in again and continued to loot the place after a little while.
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:13.064]  The entire crowd started moving down the strip mall towards us, next door to our business.
[01:14:13.064 --> 01:14:19.229]  There is a beauty supply that sells the hair weave and other pretty high-end stuff.
[01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:28.916]  And then, on the other side, we have a, uh, a wireless store, which seems to be popular for looting, I guess, because of the expensive telephones and whatnot.
[01:14:28.916 --> 01:14:31.679]  Um, as they proceeded down the strip mall,
[01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:37.227]  They saw us and quickly changed their mind and left.
[01:14:37.227 --> 01:14:45.613]  We also posted up there last night just in case, because some of the police officers that we know warned us that it could possibly be worse.
[01:14:45.613 --> 01:14:48.275]  And last night was very uneventful.
[01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:50.417]  We actually left about 11 p.m.
[01:14:50.417 --> 01:14:54.539]  There was absolutely no activity whatsoever in our area.
[01:14:54.539 --> 01:14:58.122]  The police did a very good job of containing it down.
[01:14:59.025 --> 01:15:01.970]  Mainly into Ferguson, just trying to control the crowds.
[01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:10.685]  And I believe the victim's family also had asked that, you know, they stopped all of the unnecessary violence and looting, you know, to respectfully honor the kid.
[01:15:13.419 --> 01:15:39.333]  Again, we're joined by Adam Weinstein, who is a firefighter, but he also owns a gun shop, County Guns, countyguns.com, County Guns on Facebook, and he is a witness to this, and local news was able to photograph the fact that during the looting and rioting, his stores were right beside where this happened, but it was also a tattoo parlor, I'm told, that's close to you, and the same strip mall
[01:15:40.013 --> 01:15:46.035]  Actually, our business, the gun shop is run out of the lobby of the tattoo parlor.
[01:15:46.035 --> 01:15:57.738]  My business partner owns the tattoo shop and we decided to split the business in half basically to eliminate any overhead for the gun shop.
[01:15:57.738 --> 01:15:58.838]  Well Adam, let's expand.
[01:16:00.566 --> 01:16:01.466]  Sure.
[01:16:01.466 --> 01:16:11.792]  Look, I'm here in Austin, Texas, and we've seen police before shoot people in cold blood on accident or on purpose and then cover it up.
[01:16:11.792 --> 01:16:16.094]  But at the same time, we see a lot of departments that don't do that.
[01:16:16.094 --> 01:16:21.397]  I don't know enough about the Ferguson police to be able to give an accurate breakdown.
[01:16:21.397 --> 01:16:23.738]  So give us, as a citizen, your take
[01:16:24.979 --> 01:16:29.602]  on what's really happening and what you've seen unfold.
[01:16:29.602 --> 01:16:30.463]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:16:30.463 --> 01:16:32.084]  Here's CBS.
[01:16:32.084 --> 01:16:33.205]  This is just out.
[01:16:33.205 --> 01:16:38.489]  Police say they won't release name of officer who shot killed Michael Brown.
[01:16:38.489 --> 01:16:41.252]  And I guess their argument would be so there's no retaliation.
[01:16:41.252 --> 01:16:44.634]  But at the same time, since when do we have secret police?
[01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:46.136]  I mean, I think we should learn the name.
[01:16:46.136 --> 01:16:48.958]  Give us your take on the police department in general.
[01:16:50.063 --> 01:17:00.158]  Um, the interactions I've had with them, of course, I may even be a little biased just because I interact with them, you know, through the fire department and occasionally on a personal level.
[01:17:00.158 --> 01:17:02.722]  They all seem to be pretty professional to me.
[01:17:02.722 --> 01:17:05.867]  I know that they've had a troubled relationship with their citizens.
[01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:26.245]  But, and I believe, you know, I don't know any of the details of the story, so I can't speculate on that, but I can understand them not releasing it for his safety, and also maybe just so they can conclude their investigation before they start putting anybody's names out there.
[01:17:26.245 --> 01:17:27.606]  I've been asking the questions here.
[01:17:27.606 --> 01:17:30.908]  Any key points you'd like to relay to folks?
[01:17:33.003 --> 01:17:36.504]  It's not as bad as it's being portrayed in the media.
[01:17:36.504 --> 01:17:44.765]  I mean, there was one main evening of pretty unruly behavior and a lot of looting and a lot of property damage.
[01:17:44.765 --> 01:17:52.647]  And the next day, there were some isolated incidents outside of the area that they attribute to the situation.
[01:17:52.647 --> 01:18:00.588]  But for the most part, after last night, in the evening after the press conferences with the family and whatnot, things
[01:18:01.445 --> 01:18:05.309]  But since the mother went public and said, you know, please stop the violence, do you think that helped?
[01:18:21.483 --> 01:18:22.803]  I believe it did.
[01:18:22.803 --> 01:18:31.766]  It seemed to, I mean, unless it's a coincidence, it kind of coincided with the next day where the police were expecting another wave.
[01:18:31.766 --> 01:18:33.047]  It pretty much didn't happen.
[01:18:33.047 --> 01:18:43.150]  I mean, there was, like I said, some isolated incidents, but for the most part, you know, it was mainly peaceful protesting, which is, you know, how it should be.
[01:18:43.150 --> 01:18:48.412]  Adam Weinstein is our guest, and I wanted to ask you specifically,
[01:18:50.885 --> 01:18:57.071]  The media reported that you guys stood out front the business with your AR-15s and that the looters went on by.
[01:18:57.071 --> 01:19:07.262]  I mean, is it accurate to say, kind of like the Koreans and the famous LA riots, that the fact that you were there and armed may have stopped looting of your business?
[01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:19.176]  I truly believe that if we had not been out there, whether armed or not armed, I personally believe that that is a deterrent.
[01:19:19.176 --> 01:19:32.906]  But I believe that if we hadn't been out there, they would have looted and destroyed that entire strip mall, where there's probably a dozen businesses, and not one of them were touched, except for the Dollar General, which had to be detached from the strip mall.
[01:19:34.485 --> 01:19:37.767]  Well, the good news is the police didn't try to stop you from defending your business.
[01:19:37.767 --> 01:19:52.774]  In a lot of Democrat-controlled areas, they do that because the big crime in a socialist system is defending yourself, not committing crimes, because everybody that has a business is a greedy person unless you're Nancy Pelosi and have a billion dollars, and you're not allowed to defend yourself.
[01:19:52.774 --> 01:19:54.054]  Adam, stay there.
[01:19:54.054 --> 01:19:58.056]  I want to do five more minutes with you to talk about the Second Amendment straight ahead.
[01:19:58.056 --> 01:19:59.357]  Adam Weinstein is our guest.
[01:19:59.557 --> 01:20:02.459]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[01:20:02.459 --> 01:20:06.002]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:20:06.002 --> 01:20:08.164]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:20:08.164 --> 01:20:17.471]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:20:17.471 --> 01:20:23.455]  Plus, Big Berkey Water Filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:20:59.252 --> 01:21:02.075]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:02.075 --> 01:21:07.200]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:15.327]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:15.327 --> 01:21:19.851]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:19.851 --> 01:21:23.655]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:23.815 --> 01:21:29.760]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.922]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:32.922 --> 01:21:38.306]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:38.306 --> 01:21:44.991]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their prepare
[01:21:44.991 --> 01:21:45.111]  Gold.
[01:21:45.111 --> 01:21:46.573]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:07.412]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:07.412 --> 01:22:11.594]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.535]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:13.535 --> 01:22:15.975]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:15.975 --> 01:22:22.738]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and weaker.
[01:22:23.058 --> 01:22:23.978]  We're good to go.
[01:22:48.188 --> 01:22:48.768]  I think so.
[01:23:11.095 --> 01:23:16.602]  For less than $100, these vegetarian meals are naturally high in fiber, carbs, and protein.
[01:23:16.602 --> 01:23:19.667]  And they're packed with oxygen absorbers in mylar pouches.
[01:23:19.667 --> 01:23:26.596]  They're completely free of any artificial flavors and colorings, have a 20-year shelf life, and take up to 70% less space than No.
[01:23:26.596 --> 01:23:26.996]  10 cans.

[01:24:08.183 --> 01:24:11.305]  Final segment with Adam Weinstein.
[01:24:11.305 --> 01:24:18.109]  He is the member of the fire department there in the town of Ferguson, outside St.
[01:24:18.109 --> 01:24:27.135]  Louis, that saw the last three days of rioting, the worst being Sunday night, announced since the mother of the 18-year-old black man, the victim,
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:35.626]  Regardless, he is a victim of this terrible circumstance and possibly being murdered by the police.
[01:24:35.626 --> 01:24:36.306]  We're not sure.
[01:24:36.306 --> 01:24:39.368]  Has called for calm, that's a good thing.
[01:24:39.368 --> 01:24:43.571]  Certainly a bunch of criminals running around burning things in their own neighborhood.
[01:24:43.571 --> 01:24:50.957]  Anybody that has a business only hurts the town itself, but regardless,
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:25:09.845]  Adam and his friends stood up against the looters and clearly frustrated folks that did loot other buildings in the area that did not have armed guards outside of them.
[01:25:09.845 --> 01:25:18.508]  So this is a great example of what the police should do, like Katrina, instead of the feds coming in and not letting people stay in their shops or homes.
[01:25:19.909 --> 01:25:27.531]  With firearms to protect them even when they were high and dry, they came in and took their guns and then looters came along later and stole everything they had.
[01:25:29.107 --> 01:25:32.028]  But in the case of L.A.
[01:25:32.028 --> 01:25:34.048]  or the case of Ferguson and St.
[01:25:34.048 --> 01:25:39.470]  Louis, the police did not try to keep the folks from being armed.
[01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:44.531]  Did you have a chance to talk to the police during this or after it, Adam?
[01:25:44.531 --> 01:25:49.893]  Yeah, I wanted to mention to you also, correct you, I'm not a member of the Ferguson Fire Department.
[01:25:49.893 --> 01:25:50.433]  I am a St.
[01:25:50.433 --> 01:25:51.734]  Louis County firefighter.
[01:25:51.734 --> 01:25:52.654]  Okay, just to be clear.
[01:25:54.694 --> 01:25:59.936]  The police actually came by on several occasions and thanked us, which surprised me.
[01:25:59.936 --> 01:26:09.338]  I was kind of expecting them to possibly run us off just for their own safety concerns, but they were very pleased to see us.
[01:26:09.338 --> 01:26:14.299]  And a few of them mentioned that they wish some more business owners would have done the same thing.
[01:26:14.299 --> 01:26:16.280]  There would have been a lot less damage.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:22.782]  And that they were glad to see that we were being respectful and professional and not
[01:26:23.956 --> 01:26:27.678]  You know, abusing our right to bear arms.
[01:26:27.678 --> 01:26:37.083]  So they like the fact that you were professional in bearing your arms and obviously, I guess by professional did you get taunted or anything?
[01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:38.544]  No, not at all.
[01:26:38.544 --> 01:26:41.486]  Like I said, as soon as they saw us they went the other way.
[01:26:41.486 --> 01:26:51.711]  Our shop has a reputation in that area for, you know, we don't mess around because of the area we're in.
[01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:52.372]  We have a lot of
[01:26:53.763 --> 01:27:09.246]  Different people in the area and some of the ones who tend to misbehave in that trapping center know that stuff isn't really tolerated by myself or my business partner or the owner of the tattoo shop.
[01:27:09.246 --> 01:27:12.487]  So this is a high crime area?
[01:27:12.487 --> 01:27:20.349]  I would say medium, not necessarily high, but there's a neighborhood behind our location that has its problems.
[01:27:21.559 --> 01:27:27.202]  We've had, you know, a few minor incidents over the last few years.
[01:27:27.202 --> 01:27:33.025]  And it's typically the kids in that neighborhood.
[01:27:33.025 --> 01:27:37.027]  What does your gut tell you is behind all this?
[01:27:37.027 --> 01:27:45.272]  I think it's more of a... I believe that the citizens are just angry with the police department, whether justified or not.
[01:27:45.971 --> 01:27:53.835]  I think it's more of a citizens versus law enforcement thing than any race issue.
[01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:54.115]  Sure.
[01:27:54.115 --> 01:27:59.217]  They haven't even released the officer's name, whether he's African American or white or Hispanic.
[01:27:59.217 --> 01:28:00.338]  Nobody even knows.
[01:28:00.338 --> 01:28:08.602]  So that... Well, I'm guessing he's... I'm guessing he's white because... or Hispanic, because if he was black, I think they would have released that.
[01:28:09.301 --> 01:28:11.524]  Yeah, I'm not sure about that.
[01:28:11.524 --> 01:28:19.032]  Over the next few weeks or days as they progress with their investigation, I'm sure the information will come out.
[01:28:19.032 --> 01:28:21.355]  I'm hoping and counting on it being truthful.
[01:28:28.385 --> 01:28:29.226]  and businesses.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.501]  And I just don't understand.
[01:28:46.501 --> 01:28:53.284]  Like, if a black person killed a member of my family, I wouldn't go out and randomly find a black person to kill.
[01:28:53.284 --> 01:28:59.568]  And I just think it's the Al Sharpton, MSNBC mentality that is selling this idea.
[01:28:59.568 --> 01:29:06.231]  But I'm glad to hear from your perspective it's more of just an anti-police than an anti, you know, race issue.
[01:29:06.231 --> 01:29:07.672]  I'm just so sick of it, personally.
[01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:18.961]  I think it directly relates to just the attitude of youth today, that they're so quick to use violence over anything else.
[01:29:18.961 --> 01:29:28.651]  And whether white, black, you know, or Hispanic, it just seems to be the norm nowadays where kids just, you know, right off the bat they go to violence.
[01:29:30.214 --> 01:29:35.899]  And it's one of the biggest problems that I see, you know, every day, just even in my job.
[01:29:35.899 --> 01:29:43.786]  It's young kids, you know, high school age and below, that are doing things that are just... Yeah, it's the breakup of the family.
[01:29:43.786 --> 01:29:47.909]  Adam Weinstein, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:47.909 --> 01:29:50.031]  You're a hero for the second amendment.
[01:29:50.031 --> 01:29:51.392]  Thank you so much.

[01:29:52.293 --> 01:29:52.793]  We'll be back.
[01:29:52.793 --> 01:29:55.516]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.488 --> 01:30:06.651]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:08.993]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:08.993 --> 01:30:14.275]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:19.458]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:19.458 --> 01:30:22.479]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:22.779 --> 01:30:26.862]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:26.862 --> 01:30:31.166]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:31.166 --> 01:30:41.394]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:43.916]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[01:30:44.116 --> 01:30:52.323]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:31:06.516 --> 01:31:07.736]  Security, alert.
[01:31:07.736 --> 01:31:09.757]  This is Homeland Security.

[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:18.343]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:31:18.343 --> 01:31:20.924]  Crime directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[01:31:20.924 --> 01:31:23.786]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:31:23.786 --> 01:31:27.008]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:31:27.008 --> 01:31:29.189]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:31:29.309 --> 01:31:30.829]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:31:30.829 --> 01:31:33.690]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:35.611]  They are never going to stop.
[01:31:35.611 --> 01:31:39.652]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:31:49.555 --> 01:31:54.116]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:31:54.116 --> 01:31:56.437]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:31:59.676 --> 01:32:06.962]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[01:32:29.235 --> 01:32:32.898]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:32.898 --> 01:32:37.181]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:37.181 --> 01:32:38.962]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:38.962 --> 01:32:46.828]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[01:34:27.397 --> 01:34:33.798]  First time callers or ancient callers to give new folks a chance to get involved on air
[01:34:35.268 --> 01:34:50.658]  On any of the news we've covered today on Gardasil shots, time and time again, killing people on the trials, killing people currently, sterilizing them, causing autoimmune disorders, giving them HPV.
[01:34:50.658 --> 01:34:54.221]  Now they're saying give it to boys.
[01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:56.943]  The schools lie and say it's the law.
[01:34:56.943 --> 01:35:01.466]  Other countries have banned it.
[01:35:01.466 --> 01:35:03.167]  You can say what you want about India and
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:17.445]  Japan and places like Brazil, but they're saying don't give kids younger than 18 months vaccines.
[01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:18.886]  They're saying don't eat GMO.
[01:35:18.886 --> 01:35:28.050]  They're saying we're banning Gardasil because they can see the effects of it.
[01:35:28.050 --> 01:35:30.491]  Now before we go any further,
[01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:35.754]  Here today, let me just give you the toll-free number.
[01:35:35.754 --> 01:35:36.054]  It's 800-259-9231.
[01:35:36.054 --> 01:35:36.154]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:36.154 --> 01:35:42.537]  We can discuss the Gardasil story that hurts my heart every time I see those reports every few weeks.
[01:35:42.537 --> 01:35:47.218]  But it's bigger than just a little girl dying hours after she took it.
[01:35:47.218 --> 01:35:47.398]  It's that
[01:35:59.497 --> 01:36:02.760]  They just keep us in perpetual ignorance of why did this happen?
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:03.941]  Oh, gee, we don't know.
[01:36:03.941 --> 01:36:08.264]  Was it the vaccine?
[01:36:08.264 --> 01:36:10.746]  When we know it's the vaccine.
[01:36:10.746 --> 01:36:17.551]  And everyone knows people that took a vaccine and died, or took a vaccine and went into a coma.
[01:36:17.551 --> 01:36:22.015]  And then the media goes, there are no side effects of vaccines, save and effective.
[01:36:23.001 --> 01:36:44.726]  Until you read the insert, and it says it can give you narcolepsy, epilepsy, neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders, death, cancer, of the flu shot, polio vaccine, Gardasil, I don't care which one it is, read the insert that comes with the drug, go online, type in the insert, you can read the thing.
[01:36:45.984 --> 01:36:56.666]  You don't have to believe me that drinking one part per million of hydrofluorosilic acid, aka fluoride, will massively reduce your IQ.
[01:36:56.666 --> 01:36:59.506]  A little over 10 points per decade.
[01:36:59.506 --> 01:37:10.088]  It'll give you dental fluorosis, and fracturing of bones, and rheumatoid arthritis, and a seven-fold increase in bone cancer in boys and men.
[01:37:10.088 --> 01:37:11.248]  Kidney cancer.
[01:37:11.248 --> 01:37:14.769]  I mean, I just... I try not to blow up on air.
[01:37:18.564 --> 01:37:30.572]  But we're being killed by the globalists who have all literally written hundreds of books, like Ecoscience by the White House Science Czar, admitting they're jacking the food and the water in social engineering.
[01:37:30.572 --> 01:37:32.152]  People go, man, you're crazy.
[01:37:32.152 --> 01:37:38.076]  Yeah, I know, because if you admit I'm telling the truth, then you've got to do something about it.
[01:37:38.076 --> 01:37:39.417]  I'm going to say this again.
[01:37:39.417 --> 01:37:40.418]  My grandmother,
[01:37:41.104 --> 01:37:42.305]  And that's it, Buckley.
[01:37:42.305 --> 01:37:43.006]  She said she'd do it.
[01:37:43.006 --> 01:37:46.208]  We're going over there and interviewing her about her polio experience.
[01:37:46.208 --> 01:37:47.830]  Because she's 89.
[01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:49.291]  She's still about 97% there.
[01:37:49.291 --> 01:37:58.439]  She's obviously not as sharp as she was when she was, you know, 60 years old.
[01:37:58.439 --> 01:37:59.220]  But she's there.
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.681]  She's got a great memory.
[01:38:00.681 --> 01:38:01.922]  And I want her to talk about that.
[01:38:01.922 --> 01:38:04.985]  She's been telling my mom that since, you know, my mother was 5 years old.
[01:38:06.584 --> 01:38:07.845]  This is the reality.
[01:38:07.845 --> 01:38:18.397]  And then I can pull up news articles out of India and Pakistan where they suspend the polio shot because in one month, 60 plus thousand kids got paralyzed from it.
[01:38:18.397 --> 01:38:20.659]  And they said, we don't call it polio.
[01:38:20.659 --> 01:38:22.221]  They got paralysis from it.
[01:38:26.288 --> 01:38:28.049]  They're not eradicating polio.
[01:38:28.049 --> 01:38:29.670]  They're giving people polio.
[01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:36.615]  And this is the same global government caught doing all the secret medical experimentation over and over and over again.
[01:38:36.615 --> 01:38:40.497]  They're evil!
[01:38:40.497 --> 01:38:41.778]  It's bigger than Obama.
[01:38:41.778 --> 01:38:43.459]  It's bigger than the Republicans.
[01:38:43.459 --> 01:38:44.920]  It's bigger than the British government.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.701]  It's bigger than the French government.
[01:38:46.701 --> 01:38:48.442]  It's bigger than the Russian government.
[01:38:48.442 --> 01:38:50.204]  It's the technocracy.
[01:38:50.204 --> 01:38:51.284]  So we can talk about that.
[01:38:51.284 --> 01:38:51.324]  800-259-9231.
[01:38:56.294 --> 01:38:58.215]  And I see callers calling in about Robin Williams.
[01:38:58.215 --> 01:38:59.476]  Yeah, it's a wild card.
[01:38:59.476 --> 01:39:02.478]  Whatever you want to call in about, you're welcome to call in about it.
[01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:05.300]  You can talk about the Ferguson situation.
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:11.685]  You can talk about any of it.
[01:39:11.685 --> 01:39:24.174]  Now, let me spend a few minutes here reaching out to the listeners
[01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:44.936]  In a moment of stillness here, so it's not all just lost in translation or lost in my banter, that when I tell you about how big Infowars.com is, how big this radio show is, it is not to have a big ego.
[01:39:44.936 --> 01:39:52.519]  It is to let you know that we are engaged in a major assault of the globalists and their eugenics program.
[01:39:55.834 --> 01:40:16.925]  We are here to speak directly to the White House operatives and the Ford Foundation and CIA and NSA and Department of Defense and corporate IBM, Microsoft, Google, Apple operatives who are let in on the technocracy, who are let in on the master plan.
[01:40:16.925 --> 01:40:22.348]  They understand they're not going to be given entree into the next level of this.
[01:40:23.052 --> 01:40:30.174]  They are operating out of fear, out of greed, out of mercenary instincts.
[01:40:30.174 --> 01:40:41.798]  And we've got to get the narrative out there that we are breaking away from their whole fake debate and communicating directly with them on a true narrative of, are you really evil?
[01:40:42.981 --> 01:41:02.073]  Do you really want to go along with this and your whole fake, progressive, liberal, touchy-feely, simpering NPR voice that you know is a cover for the savage dehumanization and social engineering that you're part of?
[01:41:02.073 --> 01:41:12.220]  And then for the listeners out there, you need to become your own newsletter, your own website, your own YouTube channel, your own local radio show, your own access show,
[01:41:13.985 --> 01:41:19.608]  Or to your own students, or your college students, or your workers, or your bosses.
[01:41:19.608 --> 01:41:31.673]  We all need to be communicating with each other about these issues and about the fact that you can say the cop down the street's a nice guy or a nice lady, but the people running the system are bad.
[01:41:31.673 --> 01:41:40.838]  And so we can't let the system get more centralized control because it only uses that to dominate and dumb down society.
[01:41:42.014 --> 01:42:04.641]  And then secondarily, it is integral to understand InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com is under attack, and the power structure is doing everything it can to ensure that we are blocked, we are demonized, we are attacked on every front.
[01:42:04.641 --> 01:42:09.723]  They're trying to assassinate my character, my name, my whole operation, unsuccessfully.
[01:42:10.871 --> 01:42:11.311]  I might add.
[01:42:11.311 --> 01:42:12.192]  And that's what's scary.
[01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:14.333]  I'll explain in a moment.
[01:42:14.333 --> 01:42:15.894]  Because we are over the target.
[01:42:15.894 --> 01:42:21.356]  When you fly over the target, the anti-aircraft guns are aimed on you.
[01:42:21.356 --> 01:42:27.519]  You fly into the flak to drop your bombs because that's where the war is.
[01:42:27.519 --> 01:42:32.322]  And I never imagined as a child, or even as an activist when I was 20 years old,
[01:42:33.444 --> 01:42:35.526]  Trying to get on radio and TV.
[01:42:35.526 --> 01:42:38.188]  I didn't want to get on radio and TV to be somebody.
[01:42:38.188 --> 01:42:41.610]  I didn't want to get on radio and TV to be a narcissist.
[01:42:41.610 --> 01:42:51.498]  I wanted to get on radio and TV because I knew they were taking farmers' land outside Austin to build on it under the guise of environmentalism, and I took it personal.
[01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:58.163]  I knew they were giving fines to old ladies and people that they couldn't fix the grass in their backyard to take their houses.
[01:42:58.163 --> 01:42:58.904]  I took it personal.
[01:42:59.773 --> 01:43:07.536]  Just like if I saw somebody, three or four guys beating up some little guy in a parking lot, I'm gonna go over and tell them, pick on somebody your own size.
[01:43:07.536 --> 01:43:13.858]  And not because I'm looking for trouble, but because my instinct makes me go up to them.
[01:43:13.858 --> 01:43:16.658]  It's just, it's just how I am.
[01:43:16.658 --> 01:43:26.362]  And the fact that we are hurting the enemy so bad, and they're attacking us every day in establishment organs with talking points, and the fact that it's getting worse, and that it's ineffective.
[01:43:26.362 --> 01:43:27.402]  If they destroyed me,
[01:43:31.966 --> 01:43:40.631]  In my name or made up some scandal and really damaged me, then they wouldn't kill me or set me up or imprison me.
[01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:57.121]  But the fact that everything they do bounces off of InfoWars, we are now crossing that event horizon that even though I'm real and act goofy sometimes and they can spin that against me, the public has spun it back against them and it's made InfoWars and yours truly even bigger.
[01:43:59.165 --> 01:44:00.386]  And it's backfired.
[01:44:00.386 --> 01:44:01.847]  It's boomeranged.
[01:44:01.847 --> 01:44:19.359]  And I can see the tea leaves, ladies and gentlemen, politically, that if we continue to exponentially grow like this in our reach, in our paradigm-shifting understanding, they will come after me.
[01:44:19.359 --> 01:44:21.500]  And I'm not scared of that.
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:26.444]  I don't look forward to it.
[01:44:26.444 --> 01:44:28.025]  But it's something that has to be done.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.716]  But I want everyone to understand something.
[01:44:34.451 --> 01:44:54.155]  That is the great victory of life, is knowing the road you're going down, and going down that road, because in the end, setting a good example, being strong, not backing down, will be the example to others that will defeat the New World Order, and that will protect the innocents that are being attacked by them on every front.
[01:44:54.155 --> 01:44:56.715]  Because that's their real target, is the innocents.
[01:44:56.715 --> 01:45:02.117]  That's what evil wants to destroy, is children, and the innocent, beautiful mind.
[01:45:02.117 --> 01:45:03.497]  And it's the job of men
[01:45:05.905 --> 01:45:17.589]  Being a man doesn't mean you have huge muscles, or that you can do 500 push-ups, though that has historically been a mark of a man who's capable, and who's not lazy.
[01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:33.834]  That's important, but not as important as the moral courage to do what is demanded of you genetically, and in your family line, and your family name, to not be a creature of your age, of decadence and evil, and to stand against
[01:45:34.861 --> 01:45:40.123]  The flood of tyranny.
[01:45:40.123 --> 01:45:48.747]  And it is the fire that tests the metal that in the end will purify and will sanctify.
[01:45:48.747 --> 01:45:55.229]  Because faith without works is dead.
[01:45:55.229 --> 01:46:02.112]  And so many men out there that pose and pretend that they're challenging evil and that work in the system
[01:46:04.414 --> 01:46:12.898]  They know deep down, they have betrayed their ancestors.
[01:46:12.898 --> 01:46:18.981]  They have betrayed everything that is important.
[01:46:18.981 --> 01:46:21.863]  And so people out there need to decide which side they're on.
[01:46:21.863 --> 01:46:30.527]  Because deep down, everyone who still has a soul, everyone who has a conscience, everyone who still has at least, you know, God's hand on them a little bit,
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:38.184]  God knows that great evil is rising and that you have the answers to what needs to be done.
[01:46:38.184 --> 01:46:39.924]  You don't need me to tell you what to do.
[01:46:39.924 --> 01:46:41.965]  You know what you can do in your area.
[01:46:41.965 --> 01:46:55.032]  None of us have to save the world by ourselves, but by starting on the path of challenging evil and challenging corruption, we can find the levers that will move the world together with our good intentions.
[01:46:55.032 --> 01:47:00.075]  And then, by stepping forward, God, the creator of the universe,
[01:47:01.772 --> 01:47:17.939]  As Martin Luther King said, the universe bends towards justice, will give us the providence, the manifest destiny, to turn the tide.
[01:47:17.939 --> 01:47:27.603]  But we will be judged first, but the tide will be turned early in the judgment, and the judgment will not be
[01:47:28.931 --> 01:47:37.482]  As deep as it would be, and it will not be continual, that you see so many nations completely collapse into absolute squalor and wickedness.
[01:47:37.482 --> 01:47:46.975]  The whole world is either going to collapse into a black hole of pure rapine, or we're going to reverse this.
[01:47:48.203 --> 01:48:11.666]  But again, even if you think you don't have any power, even if you've been taught that you're a nothing, it is the animating contest of liberty, it is the spiritual decision to say, I stand against the New World Order, I stand against those that love death, I stand against those that serve Satan, I stand against those that would hurt the innocents, it is that decision
[01:48:12.367 --> 01:48:18.692]  And simply throwing your hands up and saying, God, the universe, you don't have to believe in God, folks.
[01:48:18.692 --> 01:48:20.414]  God believes in you.
[01:48:20.414 --> 01:48:22.355]  Say, God, show me.
[01:48:22.355 --> 01:48:24.477]  Help me be better.
[01:48:24.477 --> 01:48:25.358]  I repent.
[01:48:25.358 --> 01:48:26.439]  Help me be good.
[01:48:26.439 --> 01:48:27.720]  Help me be strong.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.421]  Help me be a warrior.
[01:48:29.421 --> 01:48:32.263]  Direct me to what I need to do.
[01:48:32.263 --> 01:48:34.926]  And the doors will open.
[01:48:34.926 --> 01:48:36.167]  And the great adventure
[01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:56.936]  We'll begin and your free will will be activated and then all those areas, all your gifts that God gave you, all the memories, all the instincts, all the ancestral programming that God gave you, the incredible experience of touching your ancestors.
[01:49:01.021 --> 01:49:03.982]  Reality is so much more complex than people can even imagine.
[01:49:03.982 --> 01:49:05.943]  Yes, we live after death.
[01:49:05.943 --> 01:49:09.244]  And yes, we experience the experiences of our ancestors.
[01:49:09.244 --> 01:49:10.765]  They live on through us.
[01:49:10.765 --> 01:49:11.805]  It is incredible.
[01:49:11.805 --> 01:49:16.527]  It is so multi-layered and amazing.
[01:49:16.527 --> 01:49:19.088]  And the New World Order knows this and is trying to block it.
[01:49:19.088 --> 01:49:24.009]  I'm going to go to break and come back with your calls, Josh, Mary, John, Mitchell, Jonathan, and others.
[01:49:24.009 --> 01:49:27.951]  But we need to realize how epic and big things are and pull ourselves back
[01:49:29.434 --> 01:49:38.597]  That's why they have the red carpets in Air Force One and the giant studios and all of it is to project the invincibility deception like the Wizard of Oz.
[01:49:48.564 --> 01:49:55.907]  Briefly, also please support this operation by spreading the word about InfoWars.com, the radio show, our AM and FM affiliates.

[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.900]  I highly recommend My Magic Mud.

[01:52:58.991 --> 01:52:59.752]  Question.
[01:52:59.752 --> 01:53:04.535]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[01:53:04.535 --> 01:53:05.796]  Answer, yes.
[01:53:05.796 --> 01:53:12.040]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Kerogenics.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:19.605]  Pro-EM-1 is a powerful liquid probiotic that uses good bacteria to suppress pathogens and gently eliminate toxins from your body.

[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:50.681]  Life's getting better!
[01:54:17.197 --> 01:54:29.926]  The moment we realize how epic consciousness is, people will stop committing suicide because they weren't making enough millions and might have to sell their mansions.
[01:54:29.926 --> 01:54:31.707]  Like Robin Williams, who I feel sorry for.
[01:54:31.707 --> 01:54:38.512]  The minute we realize we're in the universe and we're part of something so big and so ancient,
[01:54:40.199 --> 01:54:43.841]  And that humanity is on the cusp of such incredible things.
[01:54:43.841 --> 01:54:49.924]  Then we'll see what jokes mainstream media is and all their attempts to play games.
[01:54:49.924 --> 01:54:57.468]  They're cheating to maintain control instead of empowering humanity so we can ascend together.
[01:54:57.468 --> 01:55:04.892]  They're having us descend so they can reign in hell instead of serve in heaven.
[01:55:04.892 --> 01:55:06.994]  It's better to burn out than fade away.
[01:55:07.967 --> 01:55:08.267]  Hi Alex.
[01:55:08.267 --> 01:55:10.929]  I was reading about Robert Williams.
[01:55:10.929 --> 01:55:14.712]  He's just another one in a long line of actors that came to a head in Hollywood.
[01:55:37.212 --> 01:55:41.096]  You know, Hollywood is a normal place and it chews up actors left and right.
[01:55:41.096 --> 01:55:46.021]  We could sit here all day and talk about all the actors who came to a bad end.
[01:55:46.021 --> 01:56:00.314]  Well, what happens is, they can make five million dollars a movie, they have so many managers and people that if they're out of work a while, the managers and people chew up all their funds and then they again live in these big palaces and
[01:56:01.974 --> 01:56:03.534]  Yes, it's not fulfilling.
[01:56:03.534 --> 01:56:09.676]  And we've got everybody chasing Hollywood, believing it's going to fulfill you, and it's not going to fulfill you.
[01:56:09.676 --> 01:56:11.976]  Go ahead.
[01:56:11.976 --> 01:56:21.859]  And there's a few actors like Jimmy Cagney and Jimmy Stewart and Ernest Borg and a few of them that came out alright, you know, that led happy lives, but most of them come to a sad end.
[01:56:22.927 --> 01:56:25.649]  Yeah, Ernest Borgnine, who died this year, he was a listener.
[01:56:25.649 --> 01:56:27.650]  But I never got him on the show.
[01:56:27.650 --> 01:56:29.612]  It's like laziness.
[01:56:29.612 --> 01:56:32.754]  Joe Rogan's about to be in town next week, and I know I can get him in studio.
[01:56:32.754 --> 01:56:34.936]  I just need to call him.
[01:56:34.936 --> 01:56:36.897]  And, you know, it's the same thing with Borgnine.
[01:56:36.897 --> 01:56:38.839]  I just never tried to get him on.
[01:56:38.839 --> 01:56:42.101]  But people want to hear from those folks, so I should do that.
[01:56:42.101 --> 01:56:43.842]  But, I mean, I like Robin Williams.
[01:56:43.842 --> 01:56:46.444]  But, you know, his politics, though, were not very pro-liberty.
[01:56:46.444 --> 01:56:48.766]  It was kind of a bunch of leftist stuff.
[01:56:48.766 --> 01:56:50.067]  But still, he was, you know, a good actor.
[01:56:52.170 --> 01:56:52.931]  I don't hate Israel.
[01:57:09.546 --> 01:57:17.733]  And I don't hate the Palestinians, but you get 300,000 people killed by IS and Al-Qaeda, and nobody wants to talk about it.
[01:57:17.733 --> 01:57:20.495]  Hey, Arabs, stop killing the Arab Christians!
[01:57:20.495 --> 01:57:23.357]  Ah, shut up, you Israel lover!
[01:57:23.357 --> 01:57:27.120]  It's an immoral cop-out.
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:36.568]  So they can run around with Al-Qaeda, chopping everybody's heads off, and dragging people behind motorbikes, and I say, please stop doing it to non-radical Muslims and Christians, and they go, shut up, Jew!
[01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:43.292]  And so, you know, that's my issue, is I'm not Jewish, but they want to say I am, okay, I'm Jewish.
[01:57:43.292 --> 01:57:47.534]  Because it just becomes a moral cop-out by all these anti-Israel people.
[01:57:47.534 --> 01:57:51.317]  They don't have to know any facts or know anything about quantum mechanics or know anything about history.
[01:57:51.317 --> 01:57:54.499]  They just run around screaming, I hate Jews, all day.
[01:57:54.499 --> 01:57:58.261]  And it's the same thing for the folks that are 100% pro-Israel.
[01:57:58.261 --> 01:58:01.022]  Everyone else is bad, but if you're pro-Israel.
[01:58:01.022 --> 01:58:03.664]  When Israel's got all its own corruption and problems.
[01:58:03.664 --> 01:58:06.906]  I mean, you know, I see this meme on InfoWars.com, and I appreciate your call.
[01:58:06.906 --> 01:58:08.227]  I'm going to go to break and come back with more people.
[01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:16.936]  NSA doc reveals ISIS leader is US British and Israeli intelligence asset.
[01:58:16.936 --> 01:58:18.939]  New Snowden documents, July 19th.
[01:58:21.485 --> 01:58:22.466]  I looked it up this morning.
[01:58:22.466 --> 01:58:26.168]  We have no fewer than seven articles since July 19th about this.
[01:58:26.168 --> 01:58:32.593]  And I see this meme on YouTube and InfoWars saying, Alex Jones won't talk about how ISIS is connected to Israel.
[01:58:32.593 --> 01:58:34.955]  I've probably talked about it 50 times!
[01:58:34.955 --> 01:58:38.678]  And I'm not defending myself, I'm just saying what pathetic morons you are!
[01:58:38.678 --> 01:58:48.385]  You're in fantasy land, how you're morally superior to me as you gripe at me when you're regurgitating stuff that broke on this show!
[01:58:49.687 --> 01:58:52.068]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:52.068 --> 01:58:54.888]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[01:58:54.888 --> 01:59:01.070]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:06.152]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[01:59:06.152 --> 01:59:10.893]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[01:59:11.033 --> 01:59:15.860]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:24.473]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:59:24.473 --> 01:59:26.416]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:59:26.596 --> 01:59:37.779]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[01:59:52.614 --> 01:59:54.520]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:57.770]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.578 --> 02:00:06.900]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:08.662]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.662 --> 02:00:10.424]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.424 --> 02:00:12.006]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.006 --> 02:00:13.548]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.548 --> 02:00:17.753]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.753 --> 02:00:21.838]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.899 --> 02:00:24.060]  I've been preaching a lot today.
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:25.001]  We're opening the phones up.
[02:00:25.001 --> 02:00:26.763]  Let's take a lot of those calls.
[02:00:26.763 --> 02:00:32.208]  And I will get to a whole castle of news like Justice in Missouri burned down the town.
[02:00:32.208 --> 02:00:37.774]  Former FDA official warns of spooky scenarios if Ebola hits U.S.
[02:00:37.774 --> 02:00:40.776]  Special report back-to-school mind control exposed.
[02:00:40.776 --> 02:00:45.261]  Kill switch smartphone bill passes in California.
[02:00:45.261 --> 02:00:45.821]  That's big.
[02:00:45.821 --> 02:00:46.662]  I'm gonna break that down.
[02:00:47.643 --> 02:00:48.064]  Video.
[02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:06.753]  Ferguson is a perfect example of how quickly the streets of America descend into chaos.
[02:01:06.753 --> 02:01:09.255]  That's some of the articles up on Infowars.com.
[02:01:09.255 --> 02:01:10.356]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:01:10.356 --> 02:01:14.779]  Josh in Missouri, talking about the riots, day three of those.
[02:01:14.779 --> 02:01:22.465]  Hopefully they're simmering down now after the mother of the young black man who was killed calls for peace, which is a classy thing for her to do.
[02:01:22.465 --> 02:01:24.187]  Josh, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:01:24.187 --> 02:01:27.069]  Hi Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:01:27.069 --> 02:01:28.230]  Doing alright brother, thanks for calling.
[02:01:30.063 --> 02:01:39.477]  I just wanted to let you know that on Craigslist they were sending out ads to tell people to come help them loot on Sunday night.
[02:01:39.477 --> 02:01:41.641]  Is that mainstream news or did you find that yourself?
[02:01:41.641 --> 02:01:42.803]  Because I want to do an article on that.
[02:01:43.979 --> 02:01:45.621]  No, that's not mainstream news yet.
[02:01:45.621 --> 02:01:50.486]  My dad, uh, we're from around North County, right near Ferguson.
[02:01:50.486 --> 02:01:58.354]  And, uh, he, you know, we all work around here and he was out with a customer and they were telling him, look on Craigslist.
[02:01:58.354 --> 02:02:00.617]  And we went and sure enough, it was there.
[02:02:00.617 --> 02:02:00.877]  All right.
[02:02:00.877 --> 02:02:01.798]  Do me a favor.
[02:02:01.798 --> 02:02:03.880]  Will you send show tips at info wars.com?
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:03.980]  Uh,
[02:02:06.002 --> 02:02:10.486]  Those links for Ferguson looting since you had them.
[02:02:10.486 --> 02:02:12.708]  I want to get one of our writers to do a story on that.
[02:02:12.708 --> 02:02:15.610]  That is very interesting to show that it was premeditated.
[02:02:15.610 --> 02:02:20.975]  We have a clip of a guy up on Infowars.com saying, this is how we protest, we loot.
[02:02:20.975 --> 02:02:25.138]  And it's just an excuse for the criminal element to run around and act like a bunch of idiots.
[02:02:25.138 --> 02:02:34.126]  And again, as I've said, the power structure is going to use looting in this country with the welfare class as a pretext to bring total control in.
[02:02:38.103 --> 02:02:39.705]  What else did you observe?
[02:02:39.705 --> 02:02:39.985]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:39.985 --> 02:02:41.446]  Go ahead, Josh.
[02:02:41.446 --> 02:02:46.011]  And I just want to let you know it should not be about race because we are the human race.
[02:02:46.011 --> 02:02:49.114]  And that's, you know, the main topic we should be talking about.
[02:02:49.114 --> 02:02:52.357]  And you exposed that so well, Alex, and I amend you.
[02:02:52.357 --> 02:02:58.884]  And we should be applauding what the mother of the son that was killed
[02:02:59.777 --> 02:03:05.961]  And I think the public's so stupid and they've successfully dumbed people down so that we fit into this paradigm where they're the elitist
[02:03:29.073 --> 02:03:36.281]  The Morlocks, and we're the Eloi, and I'm saying we need a revolt of the Eloi intellectually, because freedom is sexy.
[02:03:36.281 --> 02:03:38.623]  We need to sell that idea to everyone.
[02:03:38.623 --> 02:03:41.166]  Instead of the tyranny, they're selling us as utopia.
[02:03:41.166 --> 02:03:42.287]  Thank you, Josh.
[02:03:42.287 --> 02:03:43.348]  Great points.
[02:03:43.348 --> 02:03:45.310]  Listening on the free iPhone app.
[02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:47.272]  Let's talk to Mary in New Jersey.
[02:03:47.272 --> 02:03:47.913]  You're on the air.
[02:03:49.369 --> 02:03:53.132]  Hi Alex, I wanted to talk about two things.
[02:03:53.132 --> 02:03:59.897]  A young man that was killed in Missouri and also I wanted to mention quickly something about Dr. Oz.
[02:03:59.897 --> 02:04:10.505]  So about a month and a half ago, Dr. Oz was called in front of the Senate and they scolded him like a little kid because he has exposed on his show
[02:04:11.916 --> 02:04:19.300]  Uh, like, uh, fire retardant, how it doesn't really stop fires, it really just is toxic.
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:20.401]  Yeah, no, Doctor, you know what, stay there.
[02:04:20.401 --> 02:04:21.642]  I don't want to come back to you after the break.
[02:04:21.642 --> 02:04:23.062]  I don't want to cut you short.
[02:04:23.062 --> 02:04:27.785]  I don't watch a lot of mainline TV, but I see the boildowns of it on YouTube.
[02:04:27.785 --> 02:04:31.007]  And Dr. Oz has covered vaccines hurting people.
[02:04:31.007 --> 02:04:33.508]  He's covered GMO being bad and some other stuff.
[02:04:33.508 --> 02:04:34.829]  They've come after him.
[02:04:34.829 --> 02:04:38.551]  And so I've been told by folks that know him and have been interviewed by him, he's now backed off.
[02:04:40.325 --> 02:04:47.667]  And so that's an example of how there are people that are good overall and really want to warn people but aren't allowed to.
[02:04:47.667 --> 02:04:57.411]  Kind of like that CBS reporter that exposed Fast and Furious and so many other things and Obamacare and got forced out.
[02:04:57.411 --> 02:04:57.951]  We'll be back.
[02:04:59.827 --> 02:05:02.948]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:02.948 --> 02:05:09.051]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[02:05:09.051 --> 02:05:13.573]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[02:05:13.573 --> 02:05:20.136]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[02:05:20.456 --> 02:05:22.457]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[02:05:22.457 --> 02:05:34.125]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[02:05:34.125 --> 02:05:36.146]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[02:05:36.146 --> 02:05:38.548]  When he brought me home, the bottle's super female.
[02:05:38.548 --> 02:05:41.710]  I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[02:05:41.710 --> 02:05:43.090]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[02:05:43.090 --> 02:05:45.492]  Our relationship, all I can say is, it's a lot better now.
[02:05:45.852 --> 02:05:50.196]  I've just started taking Super Female Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:50.196 --> 02:06:00.404]  Supplies are limited, so secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or dial 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:00.404 --> 02:06:06.569]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:06:06.569 --> 02:06:10.713]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:06:11.113 --> 02:06:16.096]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:06:16.096 --> 02:06:19.018]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:06:19.018 --> 02:06:24.462]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:06:24.462 --> 02:06:31.867]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:06:31.867 --> 02:06:35.990]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:40.773]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:49.555]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:06:49.555 --> 02:06:53.976]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:06:53.976 --> 02:06:59.178]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:07:00.017 --> 02:07:03.861]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:07:03.861 --> 02:07:05.103]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[02:07:05.103 --> 02:07:06.444]  God knows what's in this.
[02:07:06.444 --> 02:07:10.669]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:16.436]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:07:16.756 --> 02:07:17.637]  That one is better.
[02:07:17.637 --> 02:07:18.877]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:07:18.877 --> 02:07:20.318]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:07:20.318 --> 02:07:20.958]  It's good water.
[02:07:20.958 --> 02:07:26.922]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:07:26.922 --> 02:07:34.166]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:07:34.166 --> 02:07:36.887]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:07:36.887 --> 02:07:44.812]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:07:44.932 --> 02:07:46.113]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:07:46.113 --> 02:07:47.153]  It's good water.
[02:07:47.153 --> 02:07:47.673]  Refreshing?
[02:07:47.673 --> 02:07:48.374]  It's good!

[02:08:18.410 --> 02:08:20.091]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:08:20.091 --> 02:08:21.752]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:21.752 --> 02:08:30.777]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.777 --> 02:08:32.218]  Look at some of these headlines.
[02:08:32.218 --> 02:08:33.559]  Military researchers...
[02:08:34.912 --> 02:08:39.214]  Are developing robot fighter pilots that fire weapons.
[02:08:39.214 --> 02:08:47.657]  The Obama administration has released more than 600 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions.
[02:08:47.657 --> 02:08:50.519]  Homeland Security broke the law.
[02:08:50.519 --> 02:08:53.300]  Dreamers plan to occupy Ted Cruz's office.
[02:08:56.644 --> 02:09:00.828]  Obama said that Hillary's Syria criticism is horse crap.
[02:09:00.828 --> 02:09:04.172]  And I'm altering the word from an FCC violation.
[02:09:04.172 --> 02:09:06.334]  He said horse.
[02:09:06.334 --> 02:09:08.156]  Bravo Sierra, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:09.824 --> 02:09:28.549]  And of course that whole thing with her saying she liked George Bush and he was better than Obama, and Obama saying he's mad at her, and MSNBC talking about it with Axelrod interviewing him, his former mentor, it's all distancing herself from the administration she runs with Bill.
[02:09:28.549 --> 02:09:31.169]  Total smoke and mirrors.
[02:09:31.169 --> 02:09:33.710]  Look, hotels are introducing robot butlers.
[02:09:36.522 --> 02:09:42.067]  Again, the replacement of humanity is moving ahead at full steam ahead.
[02:09:42.067 --> 02:09:45.770]  That's some of the news up on DrugsReport.com.
[02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:49.013]  A lot of it's also up on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:49.013 --> 02:09:54.198]  You know, we redesigned InfoWars.com a few months ago, and even more modern versions coming in a few months.
[02:09:55.239 --> 02:10:03.688]  But in the interim, we went to a new design where the whole bottom half has breaking news in a bigger and better format and a lot of new features.
[02:10:03.688 --> 02:10:06.951]  So be sure and check out not just the top of InfoWars.com.
[02:10:06.951 --> 02:10:13.458]  Be sure and scroll down into all of the other news that is there on the site.
[02:10:14.179 --> 02:10:29.188]  And all the different apps and free podcasts and political cartoons and so much more that is online at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:29.188 --> 02:10:32.510]  And please don't forget the Globalists are working around the clock!
[02:10:35.558 --> 02:10:48.011]  To try to block us and censor us and keep us off military bases and government computers and library computers and Amtrak wireless networks to keep you from this information for a reason.
[02:10:50.196 --> 02:10:52.317]  We're going to talk about that at the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:52.317 --> 02:11:07.800]  Killswitch smartphone bill passes in California and that dovetails with the rise of the robots and an episode in 1998 of Sworn to Secrecy, The Panama Invasion, that we finally found the clip of.
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:10.381]  I'll tie it all together at the bottom of the hour.
[02:11:11.081 --> 02:11:13.762]  Let's go to Mary in New Jersey.
[02:11:13.762 --> 02:11:15.242]  She held over in the last segment.
[02:11:15.242 --> 02:11:18.423]  She was bringing up Dr. Oz in Congress.
[02:11:18.423 --> 02:11:21.544]  I heard he got chewed out in testimony, but I didn't see it.
[02:11:21.544 --> 02:11:24.505]  He did cover some GMO vaccine dangers.
[02:11:24.505 --> 02:11:30.487]  I was told by insiders that were guests, and also someone that works with him, that they did get threatened and got heat on them.
[02:11:31.462 --> 02:11:36.805]  Just like Ventura Show did, and he basically sings a more pro-establishment tune.
[02:11:36.805 --> 02:11:44.108]  But see, the fact that he's backed off now under pressure, I at least know secretly he cares about people.
[02:11:44.108 --> 02:12:00.556]  What really makes me sick is people that hate those of us that are trying to warn folks about GMO and fluoride and the rest of it, and then know that they're lying to people, and then hate us, and choose to go with the establishment, and then don't give their kids GMO and don't drink fluoride water.
[02:12:02.176 --> 02:12:07.957]  I had the state attorney on for Maryland about eight years ago.
[02:12:07.957 --> 02:12:09.498]  It was all over CNN, you name it.
[02:12:09.498 --> 02:12:19.380]  Remember when they had thousands of kids lined up with police dogs barking and riot police in a predominantly black area of Baltimore, Maryland.
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:22.101]  Not Philadelphia, Baltimore, Maryland.
[02:12:22.101 --> 02:12:29.203]  And the story got real big and parents were going to protest, so SWAT teams came and riot cops.
[02:12:30.287 --> 02:12:34.868]  Dogs barking, and they were on the news saying, it's the law, you'll be arrested, give them the shot.
[02:12:34.868 --> 02:12:37.969]  And I had him on, and I said, you know, you're tricking people.
[02:12:37.969 --> 02:12:41.850]  There's a waiver, and that's not even for a law.
[02:12:41.850 --> 02:12:46.331]  And you're kicking them out of school, then letting truancy kick in, and that's how you arrest them.
[02:12:46.331 --> 02:12:56.073]  But truancy under Maryland law isn't applicable, because it's the school that kicks them out for a policy, not a law, so you really can't trigger the criminal charges.
[02:12:56.073 --> 02:12:57.834]  And he said, man, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:13:00.657 --> 02:13:02.178]  He said, man, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:13:02.178 --> 02:13:03.239]  You're right.
[02:13:03.239 --> 02:13:11.544]  He goes, we even have the waiver forms up there on the judge's desk in case somebody figures it out and demands one, but they never do.
[02:13:11.544 --> 02:13:12.325]  He was a black guy.
[02:13:12.325 --> 02:13:14.006]  Years ago, I talked about it.
[02:13:14.006 --> 02:13:15.107]  We found the clip again and played it.
[02:13:15.107 --> 02:13:16.227]  It's just stunning.
[02:13:16.227 --> 02:13:18.529]  One of those things where, and I go, let me ask you a question.
[02:13:18.529 --> 02:13:19.309]  Do you vaccinate your kids?
[02:13:19.309 --> 02:13:20.790]  He goes, no, I sure don't.
[02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:22.912]  Started laughing.
[02:13:22.912 --> 02:13:26.054]  I went, you just fool people, don't you?
[02:13:26.054 --> 02:13:27.655]  And he said, I just do my job.
[02:13:31.994 --> 02:13:38.958]  He doesn't give his kids vaccines.
[02:13:38.958 --> 02:13:39.539]  Think about that.
[02:13:39.539 --> 02:13:41.580]  Let that sink in.
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:48.545]  They get up there, regardless what you think about the vaccines, and they fool everybody and tell you it's the law.
[02:13:48.545 --> 02:13:53.668]  There is no law.
[02:13:53.668 --> 02:13:57.330]  That's called an organized criminal conspiracy or racketeering.
[02:13:57.330 --> 02:14:00.933]  Mary, tell me about the Dr. Oz grilling that you mentioned in Congress.
[02:14:00.933 --> 02:14:01.253]  Go ahead.
[02:14:02.082 --> 02:14:06.385]  Okay, well, first of all, I do know him.
[02:14:06.385 --> 02:14:09.067]  I worked with him since 94.
[02:14:09.067 --> 02:14:10.088]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:14:10.088 --> 02:14:10.668]  I didn't know that.
[02:14:10.668 --> 02:14:13.850]  I was mentioning folks that I knew that knew him.
[02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:14.571]  I didn't know you knew him.
[02:14:14.571 --> 02:14:15.572]  Go ahead.
[02:14:15.572 --> 02:14:17.613]  Yeah, I know him, and it's very unfair.
[02:14:17.613 --> 02:14:18.314]  I came to show...
[02:14:19.401 --> 02:14:25.783]  He was exposing things like the chicken being sent off to China just like you do.
[02:14:25.783 --> 02:14:29.204]  And he was shocked at finding some of these things.
[02:14:29.204 --> 02:14:31.865]  And he does recommend natural products.
[02:14:31.865 --> 02:14:33.526]  He gets other doctors on there.
[02:14:33.526 --> 02:14:34.526]  He's one of the best
[02:14:35.268 --> 02:14:40.069]  He's one of the best cardiothoracic surgeons in the world.
[02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:44.170]  He's not an internist, but he's interested in this stuff himself.
[02:14:44.170 --> 02:14:46.551]  So he gets people on there that do studies.
[02:14:46.551 --> 02:14:54.973]  So one of the things the FDA and some big company were saying that, oh, he recommended green coffee beans from the Andes.
[02:14:56.762 --> 02:14:57.183]  Sure, sure.
[02:15:15.552 --> 02:15:18.453]  Over a period of time, even... Sure, I'm glad you mentioned this.
[02:15:18.453 --> 02:15:22.655]  Listen, everybody knows that coffee is a stimulant.
[02:15:22.655 --> 02:15:26.457]  Everybody knows that stimulants are what you give people to suppress appetite.
[02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:33.573]  And again, they don't like a respected medical doctor who has respected people on.
[02:15:33.573 --> 02:15:36.194]  Big Pharma is scared of him.
[02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:37.735]  And they know he's a good guy.
[02:15:37.735 --> 02:15:38.855]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:15:38.855 --> 02:15:41.096]  I don't want to get him in more trouble.
[02:15:41.096 --> 02:15:46.519]  But the system already knows that Dr. Oz knows about the New World Order.
[02:15:46.519 --> 02:15:49.160]  Dr. Oz knows about Gardasil.
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:56.043]  Dr. Oz has tried to get stuff on air and been shot down by network lawyers so they want to destroy him.
[02:15:58.005 --> 02:16:01.809]  And Kevin Trudeau was a charlatan in many respects.
[02:16:01.809 --> 02:16:08.015]  I didn't want him to be shot down because some of the books he wrote about herbs and stuff were accurate, in my view.
[02:16:08.015 --> 02:16:12.519]  And if they could shoot him down, they could then destroy Dr. Oz or anybody else.
[02:16:12.519 --> 02:16:14.561]  So yeah, now they're going to go after people like Dr. Oz.
[02:16:16.289 --> 02:16:22.618]  Because he dares to, you know, be one of the few good things on mainstream media.
[02:16:22.618 --> 02:16:27.326]  And I'm glad you raised that point, so we should try to stand beside him.
[02:16:27.326 --> 02:16:29.749]  But, you know, now they just intend for him to shut up.
[02:16:29.749 --> 02:16:30.531]  This is his warning.
[02:16:31.548 --> 02:16:33.428]  And if he doesn't shut up, they'll come after him.
[02:16:33.428 --> 02:16:37.249]  But what would happen if everybody started telling the truth?
[02:16:37.249 --> 02:16:39.490]  They couldn't get rid of every CBS reporter.
[02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:40.990]  They couldn't get rid of Dr. Oz.
[02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:42.370]  They couldn't get rid of Matt Drudge.
[02:16:42.370 --> 02:16:43.850]  They couldn't get rid of WorldNetDaily.
[02:16:43.850 --> 02:16:45.351]  They couldn't get rid of Infowars.
[02:16:45.351 --> 02:16:54.813]  They couldn't get rid of... See, that's why we've all got to start our own media, and that's why we've got to support media that tries to tell the truth and breaks news.
[02:16:54.813 --> 02:16:55.353]  God bless you.
[02:16:55.353 --> 02:16:56.193]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:03.881]  Yeah, over the years, I've talked to a lot of people that, oh, Dr. Oz, you know, says he likes your show.
[02:17:03.881 --> 02:17:05.742]  Oh, Dr. Oz knows about a lot more.
[02:17:05.742 --> 02:17:06.822]  He's trying to get this on the air.
[02:17:06.822 --> 02:17:15.645]  So I've had a lot of guests on the show that have worked with Dr. Oz, been on his show, or done other things behind the scenes with him.
[02:17:15.645 --> 02:17:19.626]  And so I've always been told he's a good guy, and that's been evidenced.
[02:17:19.626 --> 02:17:21.206]  Let's go to Jonathan in Missouri.
[02:17:21.206 --> 02:17:22.087]  You're on the air.
[02:17:22.087 --> 02:17:22.747]  Thanks for holding.
[02:17:22.747 --> 02:17:23.087]  Go ahead.
[02:17:26.305 --> 02:17:28.006]  Go ahead, Jonathan, you're on the air from Missouri.
[02:17:28.006 --> 02:17:29.526]  You want to talk about the riots?
[02:17:29.526 --> 02:17:29.926]  Go ahead.
[02:17:29.926 --> 02:17:32.907]  Okay, we'll move on, see if he comes back.
[02:17:32.907 --> 02:17:34.508]  Mitchell in Oregon, thanks for calling.
[02:17:34.508 --> 02:17:37.269]  Go ahead.
[02:17:37.269 --> 02:17:38.290]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:39.010]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:39.010 --> 02:17:42.731]  Salute from us up here in Oregon.
[02:17:42.731 --> 02:17:51.935]  Look at you as a colonel, exposing so much, and we're so thankful for your courage and your ability to spread the word.
[02:17:51.935 --> 02:17:52.755]  That's a great thing.
[02:17:53.678 --> 02:17:59.981]  I wanted to ask you, have you ever heard of the 22 degree halo?
[02:17:59.981 --> 02:18:02.242]  No, I haven't.
[02:18:02.242 --> 02:18:06.103]  Well, that's a term I haven't heard of it until recently either.
[02:18:06.103 --> 02:18:11.225]  It came from one of our local meteorologists, and it's pretty interesting.
[02:18:11.225 --> 02:18:20.349]  He said that they call it the 22 degree halo now, when you can see the chemical halo around the sun.
[02:18:21.428 --> 02:18:29.931]  And they don't know I have heard of a chemical halo because of all the barium salts, aluminum dioxide, other things being sprayed that's being added to jet fuel.
[02:18:29.931 --> 02:18:32.052]  Even the pilots don't know.
[02:18:32.052 --> 02:18:32.432]  Yes.
[02:18:32.432 --> 02:18:38.054]  I mean, I was aware of the rainbow halo of chemicals that can also be formed by smog.
[02:18:38.054 --> 02:18:40.134]  So, yes, I was aware of chemical halos.
[02:18:40.134 --> 02:18:44.076]  I was not aware of 22 degree halos.
[02:18:44.076 --> 02:18:47.637]  Well, it's not, you know, he mentioned that.
[02:18:47.637 --> 02:18:48.257]  No, no, no, no.
[02:18:48.257 --> 02:18:49.137]  I mean, we Googled it.
[02:18:49.137 --> 02:18:50.338]  It is a meteorology term.
[02:18:50.338 --> 02:18:50.778]  You're correct.
[02:18:52.079 --> 02:19:05.063]  Well, uh, he never starts it off with how they're much more evident after we have all these clouds shaped like serpents that come out of the ends of these airplanes.
[02:19:05.063 --> 02:19:07.764]  You know, uh, I'm old school.
[02:19:07.764 --> 02:19:15.266]  I remember looking up at the sky and seeing stagecoaches and bow and arrows and little things in the sky.
[02:19:15.266 --> 02:19:21.088]  Now all we see are these, like I say, serpent-shaped clouds that exit the tail ends of planes.
[02:19:22.339 --> 02:19:25.000]  And they're calling it natural.
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:25.501]  No, I know.
[02:19:25.501 --> 02:19:29.702]  I mean, condensation trails never lasted more than a few minutes until the mid-1990s.
[02:19:29.702 --> 02:19:40.187]  And it turns out there's a guy that got a Nobel Prize in 1992, I forget the scientist's name, for having it added to the jet fuel, the patents, so that no one would know it was going on.
[02:19:40.187 --> 02:19:43.189]  It's done at the industrial level with the jet fuel.
[02:19:43.189 --> 02:19:49.792]  That's why you'll see a plane right by another plane not spraying it, and then it aerosolizes out of the jet turbines.
[02:19:50.714 --> 02:19:53.397]  People can look up those patents.
[02:19:53.397 --> 02:19:58.403]  We're going to come back and talk to Randy, D-Max, Mad Wit, and others.
[02:19:59.710 --> 02:20:02.311]  If you owe the IRS back taxes, listen carefully.

[02:21:59.244 --> 02:22:01.526]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[02:22:01.526 --> 02:22:08.950]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:19.778]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:22:19.778 --> 02:22:29.024]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:22:29.744 --> 02:22:33.808]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:22:33.808 --> 02:22:37.571]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:22:37.571 --> 02:22:39.632]  Experience the new formula.

[02:22:58.211 --> 02:23:00.052]  Adam Miller here with Midas Resources.
[02:23:00.052 --> 02:23:01.413]  Today, August 8th, 2014, gold opened at $13.1340.
[02:23:01.413 --> 02:23:05.036]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $13.6104, $6.8052 for half ounce, or $3.4026 for quarter ounce.
[02:23:05.036 --> 02:23:05.396]  That's $13.6104, $6.8052, and $3.4026.
[02:23:18.044 --> 02:23:19.285]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:19.285 --> 02:23:24.569]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:24.569 --> 02:23:25.450]  Wait a sec.
[02:23:25.450 --> 02:23:29.853]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next debt increase.
[02:23:29.853 --> 02:23:31.575]  And there's no end to this madness.
[02:23:31.575 --> 02:23:36.779]  That old 401K and IRA can be converted into physical gold without tax consequences.
[02:23:37.319 --> 02:23:40.261]  I explained this in my book, 10 Reasons to Buy Gold.

[02:23:50.909 --> 02:23:51.989]  I can see for miles and miles and miles.
[02:24:12.529 --> 02:24:13.970]  I'm with DeAndre Smith.
[02:24:13.970 --> 02:24:18.592]  And this is exactly what's supposed to happen when an injustice is happening in your community.
[02:24:18.592 --> 02:24:21.294]  When you have kids getting killed for nothing.
[02:24:21.294 --> 02:24:24.756]  When they're out here minding their business, you can lock them up.
[02:24:24.756 --> 02:24:25.896]  You can teach them.
[02:24:25.896 --> 02:24:26.557]  You can mold them.
[02:24:26.557 --> 02:24:28.378]  At the same time, you ain't got to kill them.
[02:24:28.378 --> 02:24:29.939]  He ain't got no gun in his hands.
[02:24:29.939 --> 02:24:30.859]  Why you kill him?
[02:24:30.859 --> 02:24:32.520]  You say Trayvon had a hoodie on.
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:34.161]  You didn't know what was going on with him.
[02:24:34.161 --> 02:24:35.202]  He didn't have no hoodie on.
[02:24:35.202 --> 02:24:37.623]  His hands was up when you shot him.
[02:24:37.623 --> 02:24:38.964]  So what's your excuse?
[02:24:38.964 --> 02:24:39.364]  I was here.
[02:24:40.603 --> 02:24:41.404]  I was here.
[02:24:41.404 --> 02:24:42.865]  I was out here.
[02:24:42.865 --> 02:24:45.567]  That's all I can say.
[02:24:45.567 --> 02:24:48.709]  I was out here with the community.
[02:24:48.709 --> 02:24:50.350]  That's all I can say.
[02:24:50.350 --> 02:24:53.353]  I was out here standing side by side with the community.
[02:24:53.353 --> 02:24:57.616]  I mean, I don't think it's over, honestly.
[02:24:57.616 --> 02:25:01.379]  I think they just got a taste of what fighting back means.
[02:25:01.379 --> 02:25:02.519]  I think they got a taste of
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:03.941]  Huh?
[02:25:03.941 --> 02:25:04.522]  In St.
[02:25:04.522 --> 02:25:04.802]  Louis.
[02:25:04.802 --> 02:25:05.183]  In St.
[02:25:05.183 --> 02:25:07.505]  Louis, the last state to abolish slavery.
[02:25:07.505 --> 02:25:11.190]  Do they think they still have power over certain things?
[02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:15.055]  I believe so because they're doing stuff like this and getting away with it.
[02:25:15.055 --> 02:25:15.896]  People ain't saying nothing.
[02:25:15.896 --> 02:25:18.259]  They're not doing nothing across the country.
[02:25:18.259 --> 02:25:19.401]  They're not going for a year.
[02:25:20.492 --> 02:25:20.712]  St.
[02:25:20.712 --> 02:25:21.693]  Louis ain't going for it.
[02:25:21.693 --> 02:25:23.315]  This is how they eat here.
[02:25:23.315 --> 02:25:24.956]  This is how they receive money.
[02:25:24.956 --> 02:25:30.061]  Businesses, the taxes, police stopping people, giving them tickets, taking them to court, locking them up.
[02:25:30.061 --> 02:25:31.382]  That's how they make money in St.
[02:25:31.382 --> 02:25:32.703]  Louis.
[02:25:32.703 --> 02:25:35.086]  Traffic, everything is all about money in St.
[02:25:35.086 --> 02:25:36.407]  Louis.
[02:25:36.407 --> 02:25:37.248]  So when you stop
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:40.622]  Their flow of income.
[02:25:40.622 --> 02:25:48.907]  When you stop, their whole, everything, their business, they organize, they have certain things in a certain way.
[02:25:48.907 --> 02:25:49.407]  Right?
[02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:50.908]  Secret society type of deal.
[02:25:50.908 --> 02:25:51.389]  Right?
[02:25:51.389 --> 02:25:53.330]  We're going to eat and you guys are going to starve.
[02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:54.090]  Justification.
[02:25:54.090 --> 02:25:58.934]  Put you in a certain neighborhood by yourself and see if you can starve in a proper way.
[02:25:58.934 --> 02:26:00.254]  It's not going to happen.
[02:26:00.254 --> 02:26:00.735]  Not in St.
[02:26:00.735 --> 02:26:00.955]  Louis.
[02:26:02.691 --> 02:26:18.356]  You know, the funny thing about Mr. Smith is some of what he says has some truth to it, but it's not a white versus black thing and burning up stores in the area will just make people leave the area and not give you jobs.
[02:26:18.356 --> 02:26:27.419]  I hear somebody off the corner say, let's burn down the City Hall.
[02:26:27.419 --> 02:26:28.599]  But I guess in this country,
[02:26:30.006 --> 02:26:34.810]  Saudi Arabia reportedly attacked us on 9-11 if you believe the official's story.
[02:26:34.810 --> 02:26:36.572]  So we attacked Iraq.
[02:26:36.572 --> 02:26:39.194]  So a cop shoots an innocent black guy according to them.
[02:26:39.194 --> 02:26:39.815]  Maybe it's true.
[02:26:39.815 --> 02:26:42.797]  It's happened before.
[02:26:42.797 --> 02:26:47.982]  And so they attack shoe stores and grocery stores.
[02:26:47.982 --> 02:26:51.365]  And people's houses.
[02:26:51.365 --> 02:26:52.786]  If there's a perception that a white
[02:26:54.039 --> 02:26:56.902]  Yes Alex, let me give you a little background information on the St.
[02:26:56.902 --> 02:26:57.542]  Louis riot situation.
[02:27:19.930 --> 02:27:23.593]  And why I think the current violence and why St.
[02:27:23.593 --> 02:27:30.539]  Louis in particular may be the spark or the catalyst for civil disobedience and ultimately maybe martial law.
[02:27:31.933 --> 02:27:35.476]  By the way, geography is important here because it's actually North St.
[02:27:35.476 --> 02:27:35.776]  Louis.
[02:27:35.776 --> 02:27:36.957]  I know you've said South St.
[02:27:36.957 --> 02:27:40.180]  Louis a couple of times today, but it is important that it's North of the city.
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:40.540]  No, no, no.
[02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:43.883]  I understand it's North, but they also had some stuff in South St.
[02:27:43.883 --> 02:27:48.207]  Louis that got burned up, according to this mainstream news article I have here on the stack.
[02:27:48.207 --> 02:27:51.789]  Or some shops got looted last night in another part of the city.
[02:27:51.789 --> 02:27:53.831]  I mean, I've got an article that says that.
[02:27:53.831 --> 02:27:54.492]  Is that incorrect?
[02:27:55.540 --> 02:28:03.587]  Well, no, actually, there were some threats in more of the center city, or west city, which is more the... No, I understand it's north St.
[02:28:03.587 --> 02:28:03.867]  Louis.
[02:28:03.867 --> 02:28:06.950]  That's where they had the armored vehicles rolling around a few years ago.
[02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:07.951]  Remember that?
[02:28:07.951 --> 02:28:08.431]  That's right.
[02:28:08.431 --> 02:28:15.397]  Yeah, the DOD two years ago did the military drills about five to seven miles from where all this violence has been taking place in north St.
[02:28:15.397 --> 02:28:17.819]  Louis, which is the town of Ferguson.
[02:28:17.819 --> 02:28:19.241]  But let me give you a little background.
[02:28:19.241 --> 02:28:20.522]  You ever heard of Pruitt-Igoe?
[02:28:22.273 --> 02:28:23.314]  Yes.
[02:28:23.314 --> 02:28:28.037]  Pruitt-Igoe is a large housing project, huge housing project that was built in St.
[02:28:28.037 --> 02:28:29.939]  Louis in the 50s.
[02:28:29.939 --> 02:28:33.802]  And in about 15 to 16 years it was completely destroyed and they had to tear it down.
[02:28:33.802 --> 02:28:38.085]  And it was housed entirely by African Americans.
[02:28:38.584 --> 02:28:41.827]  And they had to relocate all these people from this housing project.
[02:28:41.827 --> 02:28:45.029]  So they're very, very concentrated in these areas.
[02:28:45.029 --> 02:28:45.429]  East St.
[02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:54.377]  Louis is another area, but this in particular, north and northwest of this housing project is where a lot of these black people moved to.
[02:28:54.377 --> 02:28:55.718]  And so it's really a...
[02:28:56.358 --> 02:28:58.479]  It's a ticking time bomb, if you will.
[02:28:58.479 --> 02:29:13.463]  And it just, when you start putting all these pieces together and starting to connect the dots, you can see that behind all of this, the feds and relocating these people and getting them concentrated and so forth and so on, you can see that they're, and then running these DOD drills.
[02:29:14.099 --> 02:29:24.487]  Just a few miles from there, you can see that this thing could possibly be the spark to this whole... Well, you know, it's funny that I just went to your call and then you said that.
[02:29:24.487 --> 02:29:26.868]  I'm going to come back to you after this report.
[02:29:26.868 --> 02:29:40.158]  I was going to dovetail the drills for martial law two years ago in the articles and reports we did with an army shop that was run previously and was going to make that connection, and then you just brought it up.
[02:29:40.158 --> 02:29:41.719]  So, Randy, stay there.
[02:29:41.719 --> 02:29:42.540]  I'm going to come back.
[02:29:43.513 --> 02:29:47.940]  And we're going to get into that and then I'll come back to you for final comment on that subject.
[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:48.761]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.761 --> 02:29:50.143]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.143 --> 02:29:52.667]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.667 --> 02:29:55.350]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.478 --> 02:30:07.763]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[02:30:07.763 --> 02:30:15.667]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[02:30:30.003 --> 02:30:33.645]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:30:33.645 --> 02:30:37.927]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:30:37.927 --> 02:30:39.728]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:30:39.728 --> 02:30:47.572]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:30:47.572 --> 02:30:48.713]  But for how long?
[02:30:48.713 --> 02:30:55.356]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:30:55.356 --> 02:30:58.178]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:30:59.628 --> 02:31:01.851]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:31:01.851 --> 02:31:09.880]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:17.089]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:22.033]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that was some good stuff.
[02:31:22.033 --> 02:31:32.682]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:31:32.682 --> 02:31:39.167]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:31:45.532 --> 02:31:47.495]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[02:32:00.131 --> 02:32:02.433]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:32:02.433 --> 02:32:09.857]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:32:09.857 --> 02:32:20.685]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:32:20.685 --> 02:32:29.931]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:32:30.651 --> 02:32:34.712]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:32:34.712 --> 02:32:38.473]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:32:38.473 --> 02:32:40.533]  Experience the new formula.
[02:32:40.533 --> 02:32:43.113]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:32:43.113 --> 02:32:44.454]  Shield your family.
[02:32:44.454 --> 02:32:46.254]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:46.254 --> 02:32:49.415]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:49.415 --> 02:32:53.375]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:09.619 --> 02:33:19.771]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:33:21.849 --> 02:33:25.610]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[02:33:25.610 --> 02:33:29.210]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[02:33:29.210 --> 02:33:31.411]  It's a military mission in North St.
[02:33:31.411 --> 02:33:32.051]  Louis.
[02:33:32.051 --> 02:33:34.611]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[02:33:34.611 --> 02:33:39.272]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[02:33:39.272 --> 02:33:44.053]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[02:33:44.053 --> 02:33:44.974]  Guns will be taken.
[02:33:44.974 --> 02:33:46.454]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:33:46.454 --> 02:33:47.434]  We will take all weapons.
[02:33:47.654 --> 02:33:50.035]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[02:33:50.035 --> 02:33:54.596]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:33:54.596 --> 02:33:55.456]  Enough.
[02:33:55.456 --> 02:33:56.256]  Enough.
[02:33:56.256 --> 02:33:57.316]  Enough.
[02:33:57.316 --> 02:33:57.676]  Enough.
[02:33:57.676 --> 02:34:02.257]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:34:02.257 --> 02:34:06.598]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:34:06.598 --> 02:34:12.720]  NSJS Late News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[02:34:13.781 --> 02:34:21.814]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:34:21.814 --> 02:34:25.419]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[02:34:25.419 --> 02:34:27.042]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:34:27.842 --> 02:34:34.128]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:34:34.128 --> 02:34:39.093]  Blackhawk choppers soaring into the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[02:34:39.093 --> 02:34:43.797]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[02:34:51.519 --> 02:34:56.967]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[02:34:56.967 --> 02:34:58.189]  In your apartment!
[02:34:58.189 --> 02:34:59.250]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[02:34:59.250 --> 02:35:00.512]  Go back inside right now!
[02:35:00.512 --> 02:35:01.574]  I am inside.
[02:35:01.574 --> 02:35:03.477]  I have two words for you.
[02:35:03.477 --> 02:35:04.658]  Predator gloves.
[02:35:04.658 --> 02:35:06.301]  You will never see it coming.
[02:35:10.342 --> 02:35:13.183]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[02:35:13.183 --> 02:35:22.448]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:35:22.448 --> 02:35:27.911]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[02:35:27.911 --> 02:35:32.954]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[02:35:32.954 --> 02:35:35.015]  If you want them, come and take them!
[02:35:37.413 --> 02:35:38.454]  We are on the march.
[02:35:38.454 --> 02:35:41.296]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:35:41.296 --> 02:35:47.299]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:35:47.299 --> 02:35:59.627]  See, when we protest the attack on the Second Amendment, we go down and march.
[02:36:00.848 --> 02:36:18.151]  In San Antonio, where they claim it's illegal to have firearms loaded openly, and we exercised our Second Amendment, and the police were forced to back down and admit they were following an illegal law that violated state law that trumps the city ordinance.
[02:36:19.042 --> 02:36:24.263]  We didn't go down to San Antonio and burn down random shopkeepers' buildings.
[02:36:24.263 --> 02:36:31.765]  We went in and asked them to put little American flags in the window if they wanted open carry people to come into their businesses.
[02:36:31.765 --> 02:36:41.888]  And every business, every business, except one chain operation, wanted us to come in.
[02:36:41.888 --> 02:36:43.488]  Now, let's look at the big PSYOP.
[02:36:43.488 --> 02:36:46.549]  You notice that intro's been running about a year.
[02:36:46.549 --> 02:36:47.709]  Darren McBrain put it together.
[02:36:49.238 --> 02:36:53.881]  And you see clips from two years ago in East St.
[02:36:53.881 --> 02:37:08.811]  Louis where they admitted it was martial law drills with regular army, not just National Guard, with wheeled tanks driving around in the very area where this happened in North St.
[02:37:08.811 --> 02:37:09.172]  Louis.
[02:37:09.172 --> 02:37:11.553]  There's also been some stuff now in South St.
[02:37:11.553 --> 02:37:13.054]  Louis overnight.
[02:37:13.054 --> 02:37:15.476]  A few windows getting broken up, nothing compared to things being burned down.
[02:37:17.253 --> 02:37:38.860]  And the attitude is, you heard that protester earlier, who said he was part of it, is this will bring down the system, burning up a little grocery store, mini mart, and some shoe stores, and some dollar stores, and no, they just get a big insurance check, and now you don't have a place to buy gas, or go in and get a loaf of bread.
[02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:44.862]  And it creates these urban deserts, where no one wants to locate their businesses.
[02:37:46.618 --> 02:37:53.783]  And then it's called gentrification whenever any people do move into the area.
[02:37:53.783 --> 02:38:01.069]  So, do you want to just stay in your housing and have nothing around you but a welfare check?
[02:38:01.069 --> 02:38:05.552]  See, that's why you're between a rock and a hard place.
[02:38:05.552 --> 02:38:14.439]  And look, I don't expect folks, I mean the general public, people with PhDs can't figure out the New World Order, so I'm not even blaming these poor folks that are multi-generational, you know, welfare.
[02:38:17.682 --> 02:38:23.347]  They at least, though, are getting that it's part of a larger agenda, and they're talking about secret societies.
[02:38:23.347 --> 02:38:26.770]  At least they get what, you know, some of the general public doesn't understand.
[02:38:26.770 --> 02:38:33.537]  But you notice that you've got this urban warfare drill going on in East St.
[02:38:33.537 --> 02:38:43.306]  Louis, and they went ahead and admitted two years ago in the newscast that you can go watch from our article, Don't Be Alarmed, Army Trains MPs.
[02:38:45.063 --> 02:38:48.266]  to drive tanks on US streets.
[02:38:48.266 --> 02:38:51.128]  That's one of the reports from June of 2012.
[02:38:51.128 --> 02:38:56.073]  US Army admits troops conducting law enforcement is illegal is another story.
[02:38:57.563 --> 02:39:00.045]  And they're there helping the police.
[02:39:00.045 --> 02:39:06.549]  We shot video a decade ago of Marines in Alabama setting up real checkpoints on highways searching people.
[02:39:06.549 --> 02:39:10.532]  Happened a few years ago in Tennessee, a few years ago in Central California.
[02:39:10.532 --> 02:39:17.257]  They had Marines with sidearms doing DWI checkpoints on major highways.
[02:39:17.257 --> 02:39:20.199]  That was in the local California papers.
[02:39:20.199 --> 02:39:21.560]  I had the reporters on.
[02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:32.507]  So they are preparing the military to be used against the American people, not just for collapse of society, but for DWI checkpoints.
[02:39:32.507 --> 02:39:45.196]  Total violation of Posse Comitatus that's been overturned to a great extent in the last few defense authorization acts under Bush and now Obama.
[02:39:45.196 --> 02:39:49.980]  But when you see urban warfare drills all over the country,
[02:39:51.496 --> 02:40:05.643]  With troops on the streets, and helicopters, and National Guard, and regular Army, and State Guard, at the kite festival, or at the symphony orchestra, or at the football game, searching bags while the borders wide open.
[02:40:05.643 --> 02:40:12.006]  A real terrorist would walk up to the line of people that's most concentrated and blow themselves up there.
[02:40:12.006 --> 02:40:13.807]  So it's a fake threat.
[02:40:13.807 --> 02:40:16.969]  Our government's giving Stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:42.495]  Our government's got our borders wide open, but all over the country now, Army and National Guard are at the Bay Fest in Alabama, or the Kite Festival in Austin, Texas, just to condition you to live under this, or at the Amtrak station with the TSA in Minnesota, or Illinois, or Houston, Texas.
[02:40:43.732 --> 02:40:50.419]  Now, I talked to major police chiefs, San Antonio police chief at the time, a good guy, Ali Philippus, back in 1998.
[02:40:50.419 --> 02:40:53.762]  It ended up being a national news story.
[02:40:53.762 --> 02:41:00.750]  I talked to emergency managers in places like Kingsville, who themselves had been in military, army intelligence, so they understood what was happening.
[02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:02.572]  They were told by Delta Force.
[02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:08.992]  And told by the Pentagon, Bill Clinton's looking at martial law.
[02:41:08.992 --> 02:41:11.854]  This is in a Police State 2000 film.
[02:41:11.854 --> 02:41:13.095]  And here's a bag of money, $200,000.
[02:41:13.095 --> 02:41:18.158]  We want you to take this just to show your friends, just to compromise them.
[02:41:18.158 --> 02:41:21.100]  They could then later claim it was a bribe and arrest them.
[02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:22.220]  Take this for America.
[02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:27.263]  $200,000 was the average bribe.
[02:41:27.263 --> 02:41:29.085]  They came to Austin as well.
[02:41:29.085 --> 02:41:32.627]  The Austin, the Travis County SWAT team didn't take the money and so they fired the head of it.
[02:41:33.971 --> 02:41:38.878]  Well, the SWAT team was just blown away when Delta Force showed up, like I told them they would, six months before.
[02:41:38.878 --> 02:41:41.842]  They were going to every major city, buying everybody off.
[02:41:41.842 --> 02:41:43.865]  They were laughing at me the first time I went in those six months.
[02:41:43.865 --> 02:41:45.528]  They were like, my God, come into my office.
[02:41:45.528 --> 02:41:47.310]  It's all real, everything you said.
[02:41:47.310 --> 02:41:49.674]  I mean, look, this is how they take over third world countries.
[02:41:50.998 --> 02:41:55.022]  This is how the Nazis took over France two years before they invaded.
[02:41:55.022 --> 02:42:10.636]  They had 90 plus percent of the general staff, that's generals, down to other commissioned officers, right down to non-commissioned, paid off, ready with new positions to run France when the Germans came in, if they would stand down.
[02:42:10.636 --> 02:42:15.701]  The French stood down.
[02:42:15.701 --> 02:42:16.782]  That's important to understand.
[02:42:18.046 --> 02:42:18.806]  It's the same deal.
[02:42:18.806 --> 02:42:21.087]  So the military is running this PSYOP.
[02:42:21.087 --> 02:42:26.188]  I've got a radio show in 96, 97, 98.
[02:42:26.188 --> 02:42:29.809]  I'm told about this by Army folks that are upset about it and others.
[02:42:29.809 --> 02:42:30.930]  I go investigate.
[02:42:30.930 --> 02:42:34.351]  Suddenly they're coming to me because I'm somebody that will talk about it.
[02:42:34.351 --> 02:42:37.872]  I don't understand any of it at the time.
[02:42:37.872 --> 02:42:39.672]  I start getting threatened.
[02:42:39.672 --> 02:42:41.633]  I've got military trying to set me up.
[02:42:42.569 --> 02:42:50.493]  I mean, literally jumping out of the bushes when I'm at an event lighting fires and saying, why'd you light a fire, Alex?
[02:42:50.493 --> 02:42:52.694]  So, I mean, I was like in a spy movie.
[02:42:52.694 --> 02:42:56.036]  I'd only been on air about a year and a half.
[02:42:56.036 --> 02:42:59.677]  And suddenly I've got NSA whistleblowers and military whistleblowers.
[02:42:59.677 --> 02:43:02.439]  So when I talk about the military, I'm not attacking the military.
[02:43:02.439 --> 02:43:05.820]  They're more awake than anybody else because they don't like what's happening.
[02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:09.082]  They know they're trying to take on the Tea Party and gun owners and veterans.
[02:43:10.214 --> 02:43:14.958]  They knew that before it was declassified, before I even told you, because they were going through the training.
[02:43:14.958 --> 02:43:19.962]  It's the command that's bad.
[02:43:19.962 --> 02:43:21.904]  And so suddenly they're in East St.
[02:43:21.904 --> 02:43:34.475]  Louis, and what they'll do, one of the highest crime rates in the country, is in Chicago and other areas where they're calling for army to be on the streets, they'll set the precedent for troops on the streets, for poor areas that are having riots,
[02:43:35.925 --> 02:43:51.572]  As the economic depression accelerates and as MSNBC promotes race war, aka Trayvon Martin, it turned out the Justice Department did have agent provocateurs, remember this came out, down there running the whole thing with the lawyer.
[02:43:51.572 --> 02:44:00.095]  Just like they've got people dressed up like Klan members going to Rand Paul events, they're Democratic Party operatives, and then we catch them so they gotta back off.
[02:44:00.095 --> 02:44:03.357]  They're trying to stir stuff up with agent provocateurs.
[02:44:05.384 --> 02:44:07.245]  We've been dealing with them, you know, as of late.
[02:44:07.245 --> 02:44:10.247]  And it's just part of what goes on.
[02:44:10.247 --> 02:44:14.589]  That you're at the grocery store and somebody walks up and says, hey, let's kill cops together.
[02:44:14.589 --> 02:44:16.851]  And it's clearly a cop you're talking to.
[02:44:16.851 --> 02:44:21.453]  So this is what they do, folks, trying to stir stuff up.
[02:44:21.453 --> 02:44:22.154]  And so, yes.
[02:44:23.342 --> 02:44:38.415]  They could easily use a real event that happens, or use an event where the cops haven't shot somebody in cold blood to hype it up with Al Sharpton, to get riots going, and then to set the precedent to have a whole bunch of Katrina-like events where they take everybody's guns.
[02:44:38.415 --> 02:44:41.317]  They didn't go into the 8th Ward and take the guns in New Orleans.
[02:44:41.317 --> 02:44:45.061]  They went into areas with 5 and 10 million dollar famous homes.
[02:44:46.590 --> 02:44:56.740]  And took the guns out of their safes, turned off their generators, and moved the army into their houses, and handcuffed millionaire citizens with no criminal record.
[02:44:56.740 --> 02:45:07.771]  So they'll use the cops and others looting the Walmarts to then go to the high and dry areas, where people have got power and everything, and they will take over your house.
[02:45:07.771 --> 02:45:09.893]  And the military didn't like it, but they were ordered to do it.
[02:45:11.075 --> 02:45:12.416]  So that's the precedent.
[02:45:12.416 --> 02:45:27.185]  Use the welfare class to be the pretext to sell the ideas of the takeover and to prime the pump, and then it's just a permanent police state that's in place.
[02:45:27.185 --> 02:45:33.209]  And again, the constant military drills, the constant troops on the streets, the helicopters, landing at the public school,
[02:45:34.506 --> 02:45:44.770]  It's part of a desensitization program that's been going on since Bill Clinton got in office in 1993 and has expanded since Obama got into office.
[02:45:44.770 --> 02:45:59.116]  And I remember at the time when I was learning about all this in 1998, watching a show sworn to secrecy that was on television
[02:46:00.362 --> 02:46:09.485]  It's a 65-hour documentary television series about military history and the secrets of war in the 20th century.
[02:46:09.485 --> 02:46:11.325]  It was 65 episodes.
[02:46:11.325 --> 02:46:21.048]  The series premiered on the History Channel in September of 1998, where it prevailed in its 8 o'clock Sunday evening slot for over two years.
[02:46:21.048 --> 02:46:25.149]  The series was co-created and it goes through and it was narrated by Charlton Heston.
[02:46:27.165 --> 02:46:37.831]  Now, the invasion of Panama was episode 14, season 1, with Charlton Heston, who I'm proud to have known.
[02:46:37.831 --> 02:46:50.539]  The point is that when you listen to Chuck talking, he's talking about how they psyoped the Panamanians before they actually invaded for a year.
[02:46:52.085 --> 02:46:53.506]  Before they did it.
[02:46:53.506 --> 02:46:57.230]  And then they said that the Panamanian government had kidnapped college students.
[02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:59.792]  But when the media got there, they said, nobody kidnapped us.
[02:46:59.792 --> 02:47:01.934]  It was all staged.
[02:47:01.934 --> 02:47:06.598]  I'm not defending the Panamanian dictator.
[02:47:06.598 --> 02:47:11.903]  The point was, is that Manuel Noriega started talking about how our government was dealing cocaine with him.
[02:47:11.903 --> 02:47:16.728]  And that he shouldn't be getting blamed for having a $45 million Swiss Mega Chalet.
[02:47:18.157 --> 02:47:24.923]  And so they simply invaded the country, took him over and shut him up because the CIA didn't want that known.
[02:47:24.923 --> 02:47:30.087]  And used a bunch of high-tech weapons to just indiscriminately blow up whole highways of people.
[02:47:30.087 --> 02:47:35.972]  And I mean they had all sorts of high-tech stuff they were using.
[02:47:35.972 --> 02:47:45.240]  But the issue is they talk about how they trained to make the public and the military and the locals stand down when they actually invaded for months practicing the invasion.
[02:47:46.906 --> 02:47:51.587]  To acclimate and desensitize, that's what this is today.
[02:47:51.587 --> 02:48:06.571]  And it's gone from a scale of 1 to 100, being about a 10 under Clinton, and then staying at about a 10, 15, 20 under Bush, and then now under Obama it's gone up to about a 90.
[02:48:06.571 --> 02:48:10.812]  I mean, they're doing not just drills, but real law enforcement everywhere.
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:22.446]  And training to take on the Tea Party and the Drills, that's Forbes Magazine, Associated Press, Washington Post, and saying their main enemy is the gun owner, is the veteran.
[02:48:22.446 --> 02:48:25.048]  So, this is real, this is happening.
[02:48:25.048 --> 02:48:33.112]  So understand, this is a premeditated PSYOP to condition the police, the military, the general public, everyone that this is normal and okay.
[02:48:33.112 --> 02:48:35.194]  And remember, when this PSYOP first began,
[02:48:36.497 --> 02:48:44.863]  In 1993, 94, 95, 96, people would come up to me and say, when I was first on air in 95, and say, why don't you cover the black helicopters?
[02:48:44.863 --> 02:48:46.184]  They just hit East St.
[02:48:46.184 --> 02:48:46.464]  Louis.
[02:48:46.464 --> 02:48:49.446]  I remember that was one of the first ones I ever heard of.
[02:48:49.446 --> 02:48:51.067]  Why don't you cover the black helicopters?
[02:48:51.067 --> 02:48:53.629]  They just crashed in Houston.
[02:48:53.629 --> 02:48:54.570]  And I'd go, you're nuts.
[02:48:54.570 --> 02:48:57.572]  That's what crazies talk about, because I was a mainline conservative.
[02:48:57.572 --> 02:49:03.196]  Until I saw it for myself and covered it and was called a conspiracy theorist on the news.
[02:49:06.246 --> 02:49:08.749]  In the front page of the paper.
[02:49:08.749 --> 02:49:15.176]  And then suddenly had like military guys in the parking lot in plain clothes getting on both sides of me saying, you're not planning any terrorist attacks, are you?
[02:49:15.176 --> 02:49:16.458]  I was like, excuse me?
[02:49:16.458 --> 02:49:18.980]  Yeah, because if you are, you're going to get hurt real bad.
[02:49:18.980 --> 02:49:24.827]  And I mean, FBI agents showing up.
[02:49:24.827 --> 02:49:25.488]  I mean, it was just.
[02:49:26.755 --> 02:49:28.456]  You know, telling me I better watch it.
[02:49:28.456 --> 02:49:34.958]  I'm like, you're... It's just... There's a secret takedown of America that's now public.
[02:49:34.958 --> 02:49:38.999]  They've got the preachers, they've got InfraGard, they've got most of the doctors.
[02:49:38.999 --> 02:49:41.960]  I mean, this is bad, folks, and it's not to keep the country safe.
[02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:43.381]  The border is wide open.
[02:49:43.381 --> 02:49:51.663]  Let's go to Charlton Heston, just 30 seconds from the television show where he broke all this down, sworn to secrecy.
[02:49:51.663 --> 02:49:52.404]  Here it is.
[02:49:52.404 --> 02:49:54.524]  We were jerking them, and that's what we wanted to do.
[02:49:54.524 --> 02:49:56.205]  We would wake them up at 2 or 3 in the morning,
[02:49:56.917 --> 02:50:02.579]  And they would go on alert, and they would go on alert, and we were just doing it over and over and over again.
[02:50:02.579 --> 02:50:07.600]  It got to the point that when we would do them, they would not go on alert anymore.
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:13.561]  These sand flea exercises were a major secretive success for Operation Just Cause.
[02:50:13.561 --> 02:50:16.022]  The Panamanians were desensitized to U.S.
[02:50:16.022 --> 02:50:22.764]  troop movements, allowing the Americans to achieve a greater degree of tactical surprise during the invasion.
[02:50:25.731 --> 02:50:28.192]  And the whole show is on YouTube.
[02:50:28.192 --> 02:50:35.455]  We should find that, and I know I've seen it, and have them post it, you know, tomorrow with my breakdown here.
[02:50:35.455 --> 02:50:38.417]  2infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or both.
[02:50:39.906 --> 02:50:42.769]  We're gonna come back and finish up with Randy, but here's the deal.
[02:50:42.769 --> 02:50:44.231]  It's premeditated.
[02:50:44.231 --> 02:50:46.013]  It's been going on for decades.
[02:50:46.013 --> 02:50:47.075]  It's coming to a head.
[02:50:47.075 --> 02:50:49.398]  Is the big fat pimple gonna pop?
[02:50:49.398 --> 02:50:50.139]  I don't know.
[02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:51.921]  Looks like it is.
[02:50:51.921 --> 02:50:52.742]  Okay?
[02:50:52.742 --> 02:50:58.449]  And it'll probably pop when they blow up federal buildings and blame it on Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones.
[02:51:00.077 --> 02:51:03.139]  Do you ever feel like you live in an alternate universe?
[02:51:03.139 --> 02:51:07.262]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying.
[02:51:07.262 --> 02:51:10.304]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[02:51:10.304 --> 02:51:11.925]  Chaos on our border.
[02:51:11.925 --> 02:51:14.447]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[02:51:14.447 --> 02:51:16.368]  Life is getting ready to change.
[02:51:16.368 --> 02:51:19.411]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.

[02:52:07.557 --> 02:52:15.682]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:52:15.682 --> 02:52:20.205]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.

[02:55:18.836 --> 02:55:21.097]  Promo code 10.
[02:55:21.097 --> 02:55:24.139]  Now Common Core says we can say promo code 9.
[02:55:24.139 --> 02:55:24.719]  But no, no, no.
[02:55:24.719 --> 02:55:28.342]  The computer only recognized 10 at checkout.
[02:55:28.342 --> 02:55:32.404]  I know it's a conspiracy theory to say 10 is 10, but it is.
[02:55:32.404 --> 02:55:33.325]  That's racist as well.
[02:55:35.933 --> 02:55:40.876]  Please continue to support us as you are so we can continue to operate and expand.
[02:55:40.876 --> 02:55:46.739]  I mean, if I'm going to put my life on trying to defeat the globalists, I'm going to go all the way.
[02:55:46.739 --> 02:55:49.480]  We will do five minutes of overdrive and be able to finish with everybody.
[02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:49.881]  Randy!
[02:55:50.836 --> 02:56:12.821]  I kind of did a whole JAG for 18 minutes segment going back to the genesis of my true awakening as a talk show host who was willing to cover real issues, learning about Bill Clinton and the proto-homeland security that he proposed, preparing to take over the states and wage war on conservatives and libertarians.
[02:56:12.821 --> 02:56:17.202]  Now this is all public, but yes, they've been preparing East St.
[02:56:17.202 --> 02:56:19.503]  Louis as a detonation point
[02:56:20.563 --> 02:56:21.284]  Yes, Alex.
[02:56:21.284 --> 02:56:24.625]  By the way, I got DNA for us last week.
[02:56:34.831 --> 02:56:38.595]  Um, I just wanted to tell you that the geography here is very important.
[02:56:38.595 --> 02:56:38.896]  St.
[02:56:38.896 --> 02:56:41.278]  Louis itself is very important.
[02:56:41.278 --> 02:56:43.300]  And I want to correct you, it's not East St.
[02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:43.701]  Louis.
[02:56:43.701 --> 02:56:44.061]  East St.
[02:56:44.061 --> 02:56:46.103]  Louis is on the east side of the Mississippi River.
[02:56:46.103 --> 02:56:47.204]  I know, it's north, it's north.
[02:56:47.204 --> 02:56:48.045]  I know, I'm brain dead.
[02:56:48.045 --> 02:56:52.650]  But that's it, Alex, this is very important because... The railways.
[02:56:52.650 --> 02:56:55.853]  The Mississippi River envelops three-quarters of greater St.
[02:56:55.853 --> 02:56:56.154]  Louis.
[02:56:57.034 --> 02:57:04.219]  So if there's some kind of a push or disturbance, it's all going to move from the north end of the community to the south.
[02:57:04.219 --> 02:57:10.164]  And to the south is where the rich people, the white people, the average people, the Hispanic, everybody else lived.
[02:57:10.164 --> 02:57:15.328]  And this is set up purposely in the city where they did these DOD drills.
[02:57:15.328 --> 02:57:26.396]  It's actually between where this Pruitt-Igoe urban housing project, the greatest federal disaster ever in a housing project, and where this Ferguson is.
[02:57:27.173 --> 02:57:28.454]  It's right there.
[02:57:28.454 --> 02:57:31.336]  And you talked about the stuff moving south or south St.
[02:57:31.336 --> 02:57:31.617]  Louis.
[02:57:31.617 --> 02:57:38.922]  What actually happened was there were people that were starting to move out of that area and they moved to the mall on the west side of town.
[02:57:38.922 --> 02:57:40.664]  No, no, I understand.
[02:57:40.664 --> 02:57:41.184]  I understand.
[02:57:41.184 --> 02:57:42.045]  You know the area.
[02:57:42.045 --> 02:57:43.326]  You're informed.
[02:57:43.326 --> 02:57:44.387]  Try talking for three hours.
[02:57:44.387 --> 02:57:45.288]  I started getting stuff wrong.
[02:57:45.288 --> 02:57:46.829]  Now, I know it's north St.
[02:57:46.829 --> 02:57:47.509]  Louis.
[02:57:47.509 --> 02:57:48.930]  They had these drills in east St.
[02:57:48.930 --> 02:57:51.232]  Louis and the north, correct?
[02:57:51.232 --> 02:57:51.773]  Two years ago.
[02:57:53.035 --> 02:57:54.536]  I mean, I don't want to get caught in the minutia.
[02:57:54.536 --> 02:57:56.839]  The point is, this is a key strategic area.
[02:57:56.839 --> 02:57:58.500]  Why was the military there before?
[02:57:58.500 --> 02:57:59.722]  Yes.
[02:57:59.722 --> 02:58:08.230]  Well, it's key strategic because of the geography and the way the Mississippi River would basically provide a barrier for people if they were to flee.
[02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:10.592]  You can't go anywhere but one direction.
[02:58:10.592 --> 02:58:12.194]  It's very, very, very important there.
[02:58:12.194 --> 02:58:12.634]  No, you're right.
[02:58:12.634 --> 02:58:14.396]  It's landlocked almost like a peninsula.
[02:58:17.426 --> 02:58:22.374]  But the threat was to the mall where there's Nordstrom and Macy's and all these others.
[02:58:22.374 --> 02:58:24.978]  It was the better areas.
[02:58:24.978 --> 02:58:28.083]  They shut down the mall last night in the Galleria.
[02:58:29.289 --> 02:58:30.130]  Interesting, Randy.
[02:58:30.130 --> 02:58:31.712]  Very interesting points.
[02:58:31.712 --> 02:58:34.815]  Well, thank you for helping us out with that.
[02:58:34.815 --> 02:58:36.757]  Bottom line, they're preparing for martial law.
[02:58:36.757 --> 02:58:39.360]  I don't want to miss the forest or the trees here.
[02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:40.502]  The question is why?
[02:58:40.502 --> 02:58:42.043]  The question is when?
[02:58:42.043 --> 02:58:44.466]  And they can't say it's for security with the border wide open.
[02:58:44.466 --> 02:58:46.528]  That's the issue.
[02:58:46.528 --> 02:58:47.469]  Overdrive coming up.
[02:58:47.469 --> 02:58:48.651]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:58:49.977 --> 02:58:52.479]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[02:58:52.479 --> 02:58:59.165]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[02:58:59.165 --> 02:59:01.967]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[02:59:01.967 --> 02:59:03.909]  If not, then I want to know why.
[02:59:03.909 --> 02:59:06.211]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[02:59:06.211 --> 02:59:10.375]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[02:59:10.675 --> 02:59:11.855]  I say, so what?
[02:59:11.855 --> 02:59:14.056]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[02:59:14.056 --> 02:59:17.437]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[02:59:17.437 --> 02:59:21.679]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[02:59:21.679 --> 02:59:26.000]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:27.521]  And I'm still fighting.
[02:59:27.521 --> 02:59:30.743]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[02:59:30.743 --> 02:59:32.565]  The Info War is worldwide.
[02:59:32.565 --> 02:59:36.908]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[02:59:36.908 --> 02:59:40.611]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented facts.
[02:59:40.611 --> 02:59:47.877]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[02:59:47.877 --> 02:59:49.338]  The truth will set them free.
[02:59:50.854 --> 02:59:54.442]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.442 --> 02:59:57.648]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.916 --> 03:00:10.760]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.760 --> 03:00:12.361]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.361 --> 03:00:13.882]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.882 --> 03:00:18.086]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.086 --> 03:00:22.149]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.845 --> 03:00:34.027]  Robin Williams, a great comedic actor, found dead.
[03:00:34.027 --> 03:00:37.349]  They now confirmed it was a belt around his neck.
[03:00:37.349 --> 03:00:40.050]  Appears he committed suicide.
[03:00:40.050 --> 03:00:43.973]  Had money troubles, thought his career was faltering, was depressed.
[03:00:43.973 --> 03:00:47.635]  Imagine if we could have gotten him awakened to the New World Order.
[03:00:47.635 --> 03:00:52.017]  And to go out and try to warn people about what was happening.
[03:00:52.017 --> 03:00:59.281]  Instead of being on the Hollywood reservation and looks like committing suicide over not being famous enough or whatever.
[03:00:59.281 --> 03:00:59.802]  So sad.
[03:01:00.982 --> 03:01:10.284]  So sad to be in that position and to have all that promise in the years he had left and to kill himself.
[03:01:10.284 --> 03:01:11.944]  Let's talk to Max in Wisconsin.
[03:01:11.944 --> 03:01:15.045]  Thanks for holding your on the air.
[03:01:15.045 --> 03:01:18.045]  Hello, Mr. King of Reality.
[03:01:18.045 --> 03:01:24.447]  I have killed thousands of spiders and watched them sucked into the blackness tangled in their own web.
[03:01:24.447 --> 03:01:30.668]  The pyramid has no top where we all live in the realm of oneness of the circle, God, the master builder.
[03:01:31.221 --> 03:01:41.349]  Even the 360th right and the fart-like Mariah has already failed by blinding themselves with the dim light of Alex measuring egotism.
[03:01:41.349 --> 03:01:50.716]  I call to remind them that, verified from my own experience, justice in equal measure awaits.
[03:01:50.716 --> 03:01:52.037]  Sounds very interesting.
[03:01:52.037 --> 03:01:55.259]  You want to talk about Illuminati and eugenics, is what it says on the board.
[03:01:55.259 --> 03:01:58.121]  Anything else?
[03:01:58.121 --> 03:01:59.222]  No, keep up the good work.
[03:02:01.340 --> 03:02:02.160]  Thank you for the call.
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:05.922]  Let's talk to Adrian from Missouri.
[03:02:05.922 --> 03:02:07.983]  He says he has inside info on the riots.
[03:02:07.983 --> 03:02:09.084]  Thanks for calling, Adrian.
[03:02:09.084 --> 03:02:09.524]  Go ahead.
[03:02:09.524 --> 03:02:11.805]  Hi, how are you doing, Alex?
[03:02:11.805 --> 03:02:12.165]  Good, sir.
[03:02:12.165 --> 03:02:12.545]  Go ahead.
[03:02:12.545 --> 03:02:14.206]  Tell us what happened.
[03:02:14.206 --> 03:02:21.889]  Hey, yes, I was at the Ferguson protest rallies yesterday and the day before.
[03:02:21.889 --> 03:02:25.951]  But what they did yesterday was totally uncalled for.
[03:02:25.951 --> 03:02:29.433]  They had riot police out there in full tactical gear.
[03:02:30.291 --> 03:02:35.315]  And while everybody, we was across the street and we were protesting patiently.
[03:02:35.315 --> 03:02:37.377]  We were protesting peacefully.
[03:02:37.377 --> 03:02:48.405]  And right around the time of, right before the 12 o'clock mark, they told us that we had to disassemble and we had to move along.
[03:02:48.405 --> 03:02:55.891]  Now, from my recollection, I don't think that there's an expiration date on your First Amendment right to write to a peaceful protest.
[03:02:55.891 --> 03:02:59.894]  I don't think that you're supposed to have an expiration date.
[03:03:00.515 --> 03:03:04.637]  But they told us to move out of the street and put us on the sidewalk.
[03:03:04.637 --> 03:03:05.557]  Now we're on the sidewalk.
[03:03:05.557 --> 03:03:06.597]  This is a public sidewalk.
[03:03:06.597 --> 03:03:07.778]  We can protest all we want.
[03:03:07.778 --> 03:03:08.498]  Alright?
[03:03:08.498 --> 03:03:10.619]  As long as we're not impeding traffic.
[03:03:10.619 --> 03:03:11.919]  Okay?
[03:03:11.919 --> 03:03:19.202]  And what they did at the 12 o'clock mark, everybody started moving to another part of the city to go protest.
[03:03:19.202 --> 03:03:23.024]  But the ones that were still standing there, they told the
[03:03:23.906 --> 03:03:26.109]  Media, the local news crews, to leave.
[03:03:26.109 --> 03:03:27.530]  They did a media blackout.
[03:03:27.530 --> 03:03:35.459]  No, no, I don't like the fact they've been kicking the media out and we've seen police shoot people before who aren't armed and then try to cover it up.
[03:03:35.459 --> 03:03:42.567]  I don't know if that's the case, but I mean obviously it stinks and so, but it's two different issues.
[03:03:42.567 --> 03:03:44.749]  People demonstrating should have the right to do that.
[03:03:45.470 --> 03:03:55.092]  But when you've already got looting and stuff going on, it'll be used to suspend everybody's rights, which is why they want to stir this up on MSNBC and other places.
[03:03:55.092 --> 03:03:56.312]  So I hear what you're saying.
[03:03:56.312 --> 03:04:08.335]  In fact, I'd like to get your name and number and have you on the nightly news for like 10 minutes tonight so you can give us, you know, your real perspective and also document for us that you're indeed there.
[03:04:08.335 --> 03:04:11.896]  And maybe you can show my crew around when they get there tonight or tomorrow, sir.
[03:04:11.896 --> 03:04:12.416]  How's that sound?
[03:04:13.707 --> 03:04:15.408]  That sounds perfect.
[03:04:15.408 --> 03:04:17.789]  Alright guys, thank you.
[03:04:17.789 --> 03:04:27.415]  Sir, guys, get Adrian's name and number and then give it to Jakari and Biggs and Josh and everybody else before they go.
[03:04:27.415 --> 03:04:29.256]  They haven't already gone yet.
[03:04:29.256 --> 03:04:31.998]  And let's try to get him on the Nightly News.
[03:04:31.998 --> 03:04:34.579]  So let's get Adrian's number over to... Who's on the Nightly News now?
[03:04:34.579 --> 03:04:38.041]  Is it Leanne or McBrain or is it Jakari?
[03:04:38.041 --> 03:04:39.822]  Yeah, okay.
[03:04:39.822 --> 03:04:41.923]  I guess Jakari's going up to St.
[03:04:41.923 --> 03:04:42.184]  Louis.
[03:04:43.124 --> 03:04:49.049]  Alright folks, I'm sorry to other callers, Mad Wit, Dee, Darlene and others.
[03:04:49.049 --> 03:04:49.609]  I gotta go.
[03:04:49.609 --> 03:04:51.331]  Nightly News Night 7.
[03:04:51.331 --> 03:04:54.333]  If you call back those callers, I'll go to the headline for you.
[03:04:54.333 --> 03:04:55.935]  Thank you for calling in.
[03:04:55.935 --> 03:04:57.656]  Alex Jones signing off for now.
[03:04:57.656 --> 03:04:58.277]  God bless you all.
