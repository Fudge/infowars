[00:00:07.805 --> 00:00:19.447]  International Business Times included info wars in a hit piece article today entitled, Ebola Hysteria, Two Old Conspiracies Get New Life as Deadly Virus Dominates News Cycle.
[00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:27.489]  They thought it was peculiar that we'd claim the government and pharmaceutical companies were conspiring to find a way to maximize profitability.
[00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.850]  Right, because the government would never suppress a less costly cure
[00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.931]  To promote one that they directly profit from.
[00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:41.834]  Much to the chagrin of the leftist media, it's not just conservatives who are hyping up Ebola for political gain.
[00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:52.919]  It seems Hillary Clinton supporters are willing to do anything to lick their competition from falsifying voter registration forms to spreading deadly diseases to push their agenda.
[00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.644]  I have Ebola, and I'm gonna give it to you!
[00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:09.740]  63-year-old Larry Mitchell claimed he had just returned from Texas and that he had Ebola, and he was now going to spread the deadly disease to Libertarian students who are protesting outside a Hillary Clinton rally.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.542]  Mitchell claims that the students' political beliefs are to blame for the spread of Ebola.
[00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:15.642]  I got Ebola.
[00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:16.842]  Sir, you can't test people.
[00:01:17.062 --> 00:01:20.563]  Without a public health system, we are going to have the spread of Ebola.
[00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:22.944]  Libertarians don't want a public health system.
[00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:23.785]  So you're a fascist.
[00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:25.025]  You just attacked two people.
[00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.566]  Ah, so that's the spin.
[00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.186]  Well, let's take a look at that claim.
[00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:34.628]  Fascism envisions privately owned businesses under state control.
[00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:39.069]  With the Affordable Care Act, the government is the sole insurer.
[00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:48.172]  And a recent article written by Council on Foreign Relations Senior Fellow Lori Garrett for Stars and Stripes hints that Obamacare could save the U.S.
[00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:48.912]  from Ebola.
[00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:54.735]  Was this the reassurance the troops who are being sent to fight Ebola in West Africa needed to hear?
[00:01:55.196 --> 00:02:02.120]  Since the VA is the perfect example of how the health care system will work once the Affordable Care Act is implemented.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.024]  And let's not forget it was errors in the Dallas health care system that initially led to the spread of Ebola here in America.
[00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:17.770]  Texas is only one of 13 states in the US to have completed CDC training in Ebola diagnosis, verification, and containment.
[00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.654]  That means there are currently 37 states that are unprepared to respond quickly to a potential Ebola case.
[00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:34.421]  And of America's four specially equipped so-called Ebola hospitals, a whopping total of nine patients can be treated at any given time.
[00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:36.302]  But none of these facts matter.
[00:02:36.402 --> 00:02:37.843]  Put your faith in the system.
[00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:39.444]  The state will save you.
[00:02:48.806 --> 00:02:54.611]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:02:55.071 --> 00:03:04.760]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.843]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:14.067]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:20.693]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:03:20.993 --> 00:03:23.295]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:26.397]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:03:26.777 --> 00:03:32.282]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:03:32.702 --> 00:03:39.370]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
