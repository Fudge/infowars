[00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:20.814]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:21.615]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.618]  It's June 19th, 2014.
[00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.062]  Now a very interesting conference took place in London yesterday.
[00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:31.025]  It was the Margaret Thatcher Conference on Liberty.
[00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.828]  This was live blogged by the UK's Telegraph.
[00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:40.152]  And this is what Oliver Dugan, the guy who was blogging it, said.
[00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:46.434]  He said, coming up, we're going to have a conference from a question from General Petraeus and former Australian Prime Minister.
[00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:49.755]  The question is, after America, what?
[00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:55.156]  He says, be sure to stay tuned if, like me, you are unaware that America had passed.
[00:00:55.236 --> 00:00:57.197]  Well, you know, actually, it has.
[00:00:58.277 --> 00:01:05.999]  As border patrol agents, former border patrol agents, have said, this is orchestrated and contrived for political purposes.
[00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:11.581]  And of course, the emphasis is not just on the fact that this is an association of former border patrol officers.
[00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:15.762]  It's really, I think, the emphasis on the fact that we have a former border.
[00:01:16.382 --> 00:01:20.644]  And Petraeus makes it very clear of what replaces America.
[00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:21.284]  Here's that clip.
[00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:24.173]  After America comes North America.
[00:01:24.453 --> 00:01:27.594]  Are we on the threshold of the North American decades?
[00:01:28.874 --> 00:01:35.816]  I threw that away, threw away the question mark, and boldly proclaimed the coming North American decades as the title now.
[00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:48.059]  It's founded on recognition that if you put these three economies together, as has been the case twenty years into the North American Free Trade Act implementation, you find
[00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.180]  We're good.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:19.283]  ...was essentially driven out of being the Prime Minister of the UK after she opposed the idea of getting rid of nation-states in the European Union when she went to Bilderberg.
[00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:23.344]  But of course, Petraeus is a regular now at Bilderberg.
[00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:24.984]  Think about his career.
[00:02:25.024 --> 00:02:31.246]  Think about it in contrast to Smedley Butler, for example, who looked at it and said, uh, war is a racket.
[00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:37.428]  And he exposed the corruption and how it's being run by megacorporations for their benefit, not for the benefit of the people.
[00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:41.130]  Petraeus, I think, looked at this and said, how can I get in on that racket?
[00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.892]  How can I run that racket?
[00:02:43.212 --> 00:02:51.257]  Think about the fact that in Afghanistan, they used to supply 10% of the world's heroin, but after Petraeus and the American occupation there, they now supply 90%.
[00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:52.938]  Good job!
[00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:03.866]  Then he goes to the CIA, where he presides over Benghazi, and tries to sell the phony narrative from the State Department that that was merely a reaction to a video that nobody saw.
[00:03:04.346 --> 00:03:07.988]  Not that they're shipping arms to terrorists and training those terrorists.
[00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.750]  Now he is a member of KKR.
[00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.772]  He's become a globalist investment banker and a regular at Bilderberg.
[00:03:14.812 --> 00:03:17.454]  So his analysis was actually pretty interesting.
[00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:22.257]  He says we've got four revolutions going on in the former America, now NAFTA.
[00:03:22.717 --> 00:03:27.542]  He talks about the highly integrated forces of Canada, the U.S., and Mexico.
[00:03:27.983 --> 00:03:32.227]  And one of the first revolutions that he sees going on right now, of course, is in energy.
[00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:38.353]  And he says that that's geopolitically bigger than anything since China was opened to the West in the 1970s.
[00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:46.342]  And he points out about how energy has become so cheap in light of natural gas and fracking in the United States.
[00:03:46.382 --> 00:03:50.726]  He says, for example, we're paying $4.70 per BTU in the U.S.
[00:03:51.107 --> 00:03:57.793]  Compare that to Japan where they're paying $18 or Europe and China where they're paying $10 to $12 per BTU.
[00:03:58.094 --> 00:03:59.275]  So it's a huge difference.
[00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:01.878]  Are they going to pass those savings along to us?
[00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:03.379]  No, they're not.
[00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.061]  Later on in the broadcast, we've got what they plan to do.
[00:04:06.081 --> 00:04:09.563]  They're going to raise our gas taxes, our gasoline taxes.
[00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:15.388]  Now, he also points out that another revolution is that of manufacturing and robotics.
[00:04:15.828 --> 00:04:18.290]  He says, well, we used to have an assembly line with 100 people.
[00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.632]  Now we're going to have just two people.
[00:04:21.252 --> 00:04:23.373]  And an assembly line filled with robots.
[00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:25.453]  Now, he doesn't think that's a problem.
[00:04:25.493 --> 00:04:29.054]  He says that's still going to be a sweeping change for society.
[00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:32.475]  He says it is coming soon to a theater near you.
[00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:34.976]  And he says it's actually taking place now.
[00:04:35.456 --> 00:04:36.356]  Again, I agree.
[00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.597]  Very few people in America understand this displacement.
[00:04:39.977 --> 00:04:49.520]  People look at the Mexicans, the uncontrolled immigration from Central and South America that's being pushed by the Obama administration, and they think that this is going to be a competition for jobs.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.521]  That's no more true than the competition for jobs between taxi drivers and Uber.
[00:04:55.041 --> 00:05:05.444]  Those jobs are going to go away with self-driving trucks, self-driving taxis, I should say government-driven taxis, government-driven trucks that are being computer-controlled.
[00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:12.746]  Those jobs are going to go away, as are our factory jobs, as are our service jobs going to be going away, being lost to robots.
[00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:18.913]  Remember that we have the smallest percentage of participation in the workforce that we've had for 36 years.
[00:05:19.313 --> 00:05:28.444]  And Petraeus points out that it's interesting that as productivity has gone up for the first time in modern history, we don't see the standard of living going up by the middle class.
[00:05:28.524 --> 00:05:30.506]  No, it's actually going down.
[00:05:31.107 --> 00:05:32.608]  They don't have a problem with that.
[00:05:32.908 --> 00:05:34.630]  It is going to be a consolidation of wealth.
[00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.613]  And of course, the other revolutions that he's talking about are in IT and in genetics.
[00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.715]  But this is what's happening.
[00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:45.297]  This is all part of a loss of sovereignty.
[00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:46.338]  That's where this is headed.
[00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:49.180]  And Petraeus spoke the truth, actually.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.143]  He's very transparent about it, although most in the media are not paying attention to it.
[00:05:53.883 --> 00:06:04.387]  Now to see where this is headed, take a look at this local story from Houston, where a Texan is told to remove the American flag from his apartment because it was perceived as a threat to Muslims.
[00:06:04.707 --> 00:06:12.591]  Remember it was just a week or so ago that Jakari Jackson did the report on Americana and symbols of Americana being censored everywhere?
[00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:15.713]  See, we can't have nationalism.
[00:06:15.913 --> 00:06:19.775]  It's being taken into a globalist New World Order.
[00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:22.457]  This is not a humanitarian crisis.
[00:06:22.777 --> 00:06:26.919]  This is a planned, orchestrated move for political purposes.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.522]  Take a look at the solicitation on DHS that Paul Joseph Watson discovered.
[00:06:31.562 --> 00:06:35.205]  The DHS is going to pay for illegal immigrants to be escorted into the U.S.
[00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:41.869]  They say they want them to be brought in, those under the age of 17, with dignity and respect.
[00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.073]  Well, I guess that means that the TSA won't be bothering them, won't be involved at that point.
[00:06:48.093 --> 00:06:50.774]  But listen to this solicitation from Homeland Security.
[00:06:51.555 --> 00:06:55.657]  This is on FedBizOpps, and this is ICE, a division of Homeland Security.
[00:06:55.697 --> 00:07:06.985]  They say that the contractor shall provide unarmed escort staff, including management, supervision, manpower, training, certification, etc., to provide on-demand escort services
[00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:08.045]  We're good to go.
[00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:28.545]  Annually 25% local ground transportation, 25% via ICE charter.
[00:07:28.585 --> 00:07:30.347]  They're going to actually charter them in.
[00:07:30.407 --> 00:07:32.890]  This is our immigration services here.
[00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.032]  I guess that takes on a whole new meaning.
[00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:36.834]  And 50% by commercial air.
[00:07:39.156 --> 00:07:41.418]  And this is a five-year contract.
[00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:43.540]  This is not stopping anytime soon.
[00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:47.063]  Now, Border Patrol agents are angry about this.
[00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:52.608]  As I mentioned, the former Border Patrol agents are saying this is orchestrated and politically motivated.
[00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:58.173]  And now many of them are quitting, as Adan Salazar points out in his article on InfoWars today.
[00:07:58.193 --> 00:08:01.917]  They're quitting because of the catch and release of known gang members.
[00:08:02.057 --> 00:08:04.259]  It's not just children that are coming in.
[00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:08.202]  And a lot of those under the age of 17 are known gangsters.
[00:08:08.582 --> 00:08:18.971]  They come in even though they are inked with gang-affiliated tattoos, and regardless of whether they admit to agents that they're actually gang members, as long as they have no U.S.
[00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:23.795]  criminal record, they're caught and they're released, even if they self-confess.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.281]  Even if they confirm it with their tattoos and verbally confess that.
[00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:38.445]  And so this Border Patrol agent is saying that the practice of releasing this is testing the morale of agents, many of whom are already looking for other jobs.
[00:08:38.465 --> 00:08:40.026]  This was pointed out earlier this week.
[00:08:40.606 --> 00:08:48.652]  There was a tweet that went out on Monday where they said they were talking about the fact they had to change diapers and do all these babysitting services.
[00:08:48.953 --> 00:08:50.274]  And then they said, law enforcement?
[00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:51.194]  What's that?
[00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:52.535]  And then put low morale.
[00:08:52.555 --> 00:08:55.458]  And then of course they were accused of being racist.
[00:08:56.158 --> 00:08:59.000]  They are understanding exactly what is happening.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.642]  This is no longer about any laws.
[00:09:01.682 --> 00:09:02.663]  We've lost our laws.
[00:09:02.703 --> 00:09:03.704]  We've lost our borders.
[00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:08.588]  Everything is being folded into a NAFTA world, as Petraeus pointed out.
[00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:21.884]  Now, it was about a year ago that the government, the Department of Defense, said that the Drudge Report and alternative media were making it difficult for people to believe them.
[00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:23.664]  They said, we don't have any credibility.
[00:09:24.205 --> 00:09:27.586]  People are treating what we're telling them as mindless propaganda.
[00:09:27.626 --> 00:09:28.766]  Remember that article?
[00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:32.648]  Government promises to stop lying because of Drudge Report spotlight.
[00:09:33.528 --> 00:09:35.370]  And that was about a year ago.
[00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.732]  Now the empire is striking back.
[00:09:38.273 --> 00:09:39.354]  Now we see the U.S.
[00:09:39.434 --> 00:09:49.123]  military is blocking Infowars.com for 700,000 service members worldwide, labeling our site as violence, hate and racism.
[00:09:49.663 --> 00:09:58.671]  Now to point out the scope of this, the Navy's private intranet system is second in size only to the entire public internet.
[00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:07.637]  And it was just yesterday that we pointed out that Blue Coat Corporate Web Filtering Service, which is used by many large corporations, had also blocked InfoWars.
[00:10:07.677 --> 00:10:10.918]  That blocking was taken off after people complained about that.
[00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:23.145]  There's also an interesting article on InfoWars.com from Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, where he talks about what real journalism looked like with his experiences in-country with Michael Hastings.
[00:10:23.165 --> 00:10:24.386]  So make sure you check that out.
[00:10:25.086 --> 00:10:27.668]  But it's interesting to see how these lies are unfolding.
[00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:37.514]  If you look at The Telegraph, you see that their headline today is, The Iraq Crisis, ISIS Jihadists Seize Saddam Hussein's Chemical Weapons Stockpile.
[00:10:38.074 --> 00:10:43.938]  Hey, I thought that first he had weapons of mass destruction, then he didn't, now it appears that he does.
[00:10:44.318 --> 00:10:49.381]  And then this line, which I think is kind of interesting, the Saudi Arabians are warning Britain and U.S.
[00:10:49.902 --> 00:10:51.323]  not to meddle in Iraq.
[00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:52.784]  I would say that's a little bit late.
[00:10:53.484 --> 00:10:57.329]  But we've seen a lot of back-and-forth justification for this Iraq War.
[00:10:57.349 --> 00:10:58.391]  We've seen a lot of lying.
[00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:00.694]  Dennis Kucinich hit it on the head.
[00:11:01.034 --> 00:11:02.296]  It is not a mistake.
[00:11:02.917 --> 00:11:04.259]  It is a lie.
[00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:06.922]  He says, stop calling the Iraq War a mistake.
[00:11:06.962 --> 00:11:08.524]  And he said this on the Huffington Post.
[00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:12.427]  Look at the headline two days later from Harry Reid.
[00:11:12.807 --> 00:11:14.048]  Harry Reid on the Iraq vote.
[00:11:14.148 --> 00:11:15.368]  I'm sorry I was misled.
[00:11:15.528 --> 00:11:16.169]  It's a mistake.
[00:11:16.469 --> 00:11:18.150]  I guess Harry Reid didn't get the memo.
[00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.051]  But this is what Kucinich says.
[00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:22.032]  He says the Iraq war was not a mistake.
[00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:25.133]  It resulted from a calculated deception.
[00:11:25.493 --> 00:11:32.017]  The painful unvarnished fact is that we were lied to and now is the time to have the willingness to say that.
[00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:40.515]  As a final piece of lie that we see in the media, we see that there is now a bipartisan push to increase the federal gas tax.
[00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:46.280]  And as it's being sold to us, it's being sold to us as merely a 12-cent increase.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:53.026]  Look at this Googling of the term federal gas tax increase and look at the headlines that we're seeing from all these different media outlets.
[00:11:53.286 --> 00:11:56.469]  For example, Washington Post calls it a 12-cent hike in the federal gas tax.
[00:11:56.949 --> 00:12:00.493]  As does the AP, as does Fox, as does Forbes.
[00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:04.096]  All these different groups are putting it out there as a 12 cent increase.
[00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:09.521]  Actually, it is a 50 to 67 percent increase.
[00:12:09.782 --> 00:12:15.067]  They're talking about going from an 18 cent per gallon tax, increasing that by 12 cents.
[00:12:15.447 --> 00:12:19.031]  That's a 67 percent increase in your cost.
[00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:30.794]  Yes, we may be seeing lower energy costs because of natural gas and fracking, but they're going to raise your energy costs, my energy costs, take it out of our household budget with federal gas taxes.
[00:12:31.034 --> 00:12:32.954]  And of course, this is a bipartisan effort.
[00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:35.215]  The mainstream media is fully on board with this.
[00:12:35.235 --> 00:12:37.956]  They're bragging about the fact that this hasn't been done for 20 years.
[00:12:37.996 --> 00:12:41.057]  In other words, it's way overdue for us to raise gas taxes by 67%.
[00:12:42.717 --> 00:12:44.018]  Here's the point, though.
[00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:51.980]  When it was last done, it was a major factor in throwing the House of Representatives from the Democrats to the GOP.
[00:12:52.341 --> 00:12:54.361]  For over 100 years, they had dominated that.
[00:12:54.421 --> 00:12:56.242]  That was another major factor in that.
[00:12:56.562 --> 00:13:00.023]  That is going to be something that people need to get angry about.
[00:13:00.644 --> 00:13:01.324]  Well, stay tuned.
[00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:09.667]  Right after the break, we're going to have an interview with Aaron Klein, and we're going to talk to him about his revelations about Benghazi, as well as the U.S.
[00:13:10.147 --> 00:13:11.728]  actively training ISIS.
[00:13:20.327 --> 00:13:26.970]  Alex Jones here to break down some exciting developments in the area of research concerning supplemental iodine.
[00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:29.752]  It's nothing less than phenomenal.
[00:13:30.332 --> 00:13:36.555]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:13:36.855 --> 00:13:40.838]  And I used some of the mainline iodine supplements and they upset my stomach and I had some issues with it.
[00:13:41.338 --> 00:13:51.625]  Until I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, who I was already interviewing as an expert on my radio show, and I began taking the product before he actually rolled it out.
[00:13:52.085 --> 00:13:57.389]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:13:58.149 --> 00:14:05.934]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:14:06.975 --> 00:14:16.917]  That are incredibly powerful that no one else has as a source for their iodine from between 7 and 12,000 feet literally drilled out of the ground.
[00:14:17.477 --> 00:14:22.558]  You put it on a hot plate and it turns into the pure gas.
[00:14:22.758 --> 00:14:25.978]  No one else has 99.99% pure iodine.
[00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:31.239]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:14:31.859 --> 00:14:33.360]  I was over 270 pounds.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:44.190]  And with the iodine, exercise, and better diet, I have lost now more than 50 pounds total, and I'm continuing to lose the weight.
[00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.674]  I have more energy, my libido, all this crap came out of my skin.
[00:14:49.215 --> 00:14:50.676]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:14:50.716 --> 00:14:52.058]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:53.459]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:14:53.999 --> 00:14:58.764]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:59.104 --> 00:14:59.985]  This is innovating.
[00:15:00.385 --> 00:15:01.406]  This is trailblazing.
[00:15:01.826 --> 00:15:09.132]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:15:09.353 --> 00:15:13.096]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:15:29.656 --> 00:15:30.156]  Welcome back.
[00:15:30.737 --> 00:15:33.899]  Our guest tonight is Aaron Klein of WND.com.
[00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:40.224]  He was a guest on the Alex Jones Radio Show yesterday where he talked about his research showing that the U.S.
[00:15:40.444 --> 00:15:42.386]  had secretly trained ISIS.
[00:15:42.906 --> 00:15:44.267]  Now he first reported about this in 2012.
[00:15:45.048 --> 00:15:50.832]  It's now been corroborated by multiple media sources and now ISIS is a very big deal.
[00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:53.173]  This is a pattern that we've seen for a long time.
[00:15:53.393 --> 00:16:03.136]  We're also going to talk to him about the article that he first revealed on the radio show yesterday, that went up yesterday, about the capture of the ringleader, supposedly ringleader of Benghazi.
[00:16:03.176 --> 00:16:07.857]  Now, of course, the Washington Post makes a big deal about how they got this exclusively.
[00:16:07.897 --> 00:16:14.559]  They talk about him being the ringleader, how it was a secret raid, and they swooped in and took him away very quickly.
[00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:15.920]  But if you go back again to 2012,
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:24.444]  You see the New York Times in a headline says, suspect in Libya attack in plain sight and scoffs at the U.S.
[00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:33.529]  They say Mr. Abu Qatala's defiance, he says no authority has even questioned him about the attack, he said, and he has no plans to go into hiding.
[00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:35.330]  So, there you go.
[00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:50.200]  Here's a guy who's been holding court with CNN, with Reuters, with the New York Times, with every mainstream media outlet for a couple of years, and now we're supposed to believe that this guy has suddenly a huge victory for Obama in the war on terror.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:17:07.271]  Now, also in this article, we see that he kind of feeds the narrative of this phony story that Hillary fed us, that this was either A, somebody coming out, a group of people coming after the embassy because they didn't like this film that nobody had seen in the U.S.
[00:17:07.331 --> 00:17:10.613]  about Mohammed, or B, it was just kind of an afterthought.
[00:17:11.516 --> 00:17:12.757]  This is something to watch.
[00:17:12.897 --> 00:17:25.803]  The timing is very suspicious, but it's also suspicious to see how these different factions within the United States government, within the CIA, within the State Department, are arming terrorists and then using them for their own purposes.
[00:17:25.883 --> 00:17:27.904]  So joining us tonight is Aaron Klein.
[00:17:28.324 --> 00:17:29.385]  Thanks for joining us, Aaron.
[00:17:29.425 --> 00:17:31.286]  Now, Alex had you on the radio yesterday.
[00:17:31.326 --> 00:17:38.629]  You talked about the secret training that was taking place in Jordan with ISIS and how they were being trained by U.S.
[00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.490]  soldiers there.
[00:17:40.834 --> 00:17:41.495]  Yeah, indeed.
[00:17:41.615 --> 00:17:46.478]  So we're talking here about a secret training base that, as you just said, was located in Jordan in 2012.
[00:17:47.299 --> 00:18:07.033]  I actually first reported on the existence of the base back in 2012, and it has since been confirmed now by the UK Guardian, by Reuters, by Der Spiegel out of Germany, that the United States, the CIA, was running a training base for the rebels at the time located in Jordan.
[00:18:07.611 --> 00:18:13.473]  And at the time, of course, the rebels were headed to Syria to topple Bashar Assad's regime.
[00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:34.900]  Of my information, according to informed Middle Eastern security officials that I spoke to, is that among the rebels that we trained was, as you just said, ISIS, which is connected to Al-Qaeda, although my information is that the ISIS members, we're talking about dozens here, were trained by the United States after the U.S.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.080]  working with Jordan,
[00:18:36.656 --> 00:18:42.000]  Working with Saudi Arabia and others, first vetted the rebels for ties to Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.102]  But nonetheless, we trained dozens.
[00:18:44.742 --> 00:18:46.503]  At the time, it was to go into Syria.
[00:18:47.184 --> 00:18:51.727]  Now, fast forward to today, and of course, we see them all over the place in Iraq.
[00:18:52.388 --> 00:19:02.255]  Just thinking about it logically, if you're handing, if you're giving weapons, which we did for the rebels first in Libya, and then after that in Syria,
[00:19:03.304 --> 00:19:10.326]  And of course, the United States Special Mission in Benghazi, according to my information, was heavily involved in those weapons transfers.
[00:19:10.646 --> 00:19:24.731]  So if we're giving weapons to jihadists, first in Libya and then in Syria, obviously at the end of the day, when they're done in Syria, when they're finished in Libya, they're not just going to turn in their weapons and be good terrorists, they're going to continue the fight somewhere else.
[00:19:25.526 --> 00:19:34.611]  And of course, we've heard this narrative from others like McCain saying, oh, we've vetted these guys in Syria, they're not Al-Qaeda jihadists, they're good guys.
[00:19:34.971 --> 00:19:36.972]  And yet, it's not fooling anybody.
[00:19:37.012 --> 00:19:45.977]  We see people on both the left and the right, Democrats and Republicans, Dennis Kucinich, Ted Cruz saying, you're trying to set us up in Syria to be Al-Qaeda's air force.
[00:19:46.817 --> 00:19:50.799]  You know, first of all, this isn't, and McCain has to understand this, this isn't a color war.
[00:19:52.610 --> 00:20:00.136]  If you're either a member of Al-Qaeda and you're not, and if you're not, you're good, and we can arm you and train you, and you're like a rebel without a cause.
[00:20:00.176 --> 00:20:09.603]  No, these rebels, whether they're directly associated with Al-Qaeda or not, they all have the same goal, and that is an Islamic caliphate.
[00:20:10.023 --> 00:20:11.824]  That is Islam, that's Trump, everybody.
[00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:20.490]  So what we need to understand, first of all, is that we, the United States, and then also the Saudis, are playing with fire in a major, major way.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:35.165]  Yes, they're 5th century throwbacks in their mentality, but we're giving them 21st century weapons, including MANPADS, first looted from Qaddafi's reserves in Libya when we failed to protect them, they say.
[00:20:35.545 --> 00:20:41.668]  And we actually did give, according to my information, some of the Syrian rebels anti-aircraft missiles as well.
[00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:43.528]  So now these missiles threaten the United States.
[00:20:43.568 --> 00:20:45.929]  But bringing us to Iraq, it's very interesting.
[00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.651]  I know that the logic here is that, okay,
[00:20:50.472 --> 00:20:50.972]  The U.S.
[00:20:51.232 --> 00:20:57.634]  trained and armed the rebels in Libya, and then the rebels were the ones, Al-Qaeda, whoever they are, toppled the Gaddafi regime.
[00:20:58.054 --> 00:20:59.514]  And then we did the same thing in Syria.
[00:20:59.534 --> 00:21:05.215]  So therefore, if we see the rebels fighting now in Iraq, we, the United States, must be behind it.
[00:21:05.996 --> 00:21:06.436]  I don't know.
[00:21:06.536 --> 00:21:11.537]  I think that actually this could be the Saudis, first, our partner in all of this.
[00:21:12.017 --> 00:21:16.098]  They helped get the weapons to the rebels in Libya and then in Syria.
[00:21:16.138 --> 00:21:19.999]  But then we, Syria-Iran partners, suddenly we abandoned
[00:21:20.755 --> 00:21:28.822]  We, the United States, abandoned the insurgency, the coordination of arms with the Saudis, after this rapprochement with Iran.
[00:21:29.522 --> 00:21:36.348]  In other words, Obama seems to want to orient the United States toward the Iranian access, for whatever reason.
[00:21:36.788 --> 00:21:47.197]  And so this, it could very well be, and according to my sources this is the case, that Saudis now are desperate, they're backed into a corner, so what do they do?
[00:21:47.971 --> 00:21:57.818]  They can play the same game that other countries, including the United States, did, and that is call up ISIS again, call up the rebels, and this time fill the void in Syria.
[00:21:57.838 --> 00:22:04.362]  But interestingly, my information is that Obama called for Iran, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
[00:22:04.402 --> 00:22:17.051]  It was actually the Obama administration that opened the door for them by calling the Iraqi government and then demanding, actually, that the Iraqi government allow Iran forces into Iraq.
[00:22:18.015 --> 00:22:24.297]  Whether the Saudis started this in Iraq or not, it's playing to the cards of Iran in a major way.
[00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:30.399]  Yeah, and it's kind of hard to tell in many cases where the Saudis end and where the CIA begins.
[00:22:30.699 --> 00:22:37.782]  You know, I remember Henry Kissinger famously saying, we have no permanent allies, only permanent interests.
[00:22:37.902 --> 00:22:47.545]  And I think really the interest of the military-industrial complex is to try to keep everybody fighting amongst themselves, especially in the Middle East, as long as they can keep all these different
[00:22:48.245 --> 00:22:58.315]  And I think Americans tend to think of the Muslims as kind of this monolithic group, but we don't realize in many cases how divided they are with these religious denominations and different sects.
[00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:07.924]  They've got the Sunnis and the Shias and the Wahhabi version of it, and how they're pushing each other, and how that's all tied together into the politics and the regimes of the area.
[00:23:08.284 --> 00:23:11.967]  But we've seen the United States pushing this over and over again.
[00:23:12.768 --> 00:23:15.010]  Feeding this, training this, supplying this.
[00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:23.416]  Let's go back to Benghazi and this article that you broke yesterday on the Alex Jones Radio Show and is up now on WND.
[00:23:23.856 --> 00:23:27.079]  Obama's scheme derailed the capture of a Benghazi killer.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.801]  Yeah, first, okay, get this.
[00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:39.368]  Suddenly, all of a sudden this week, well actually it was on Sunday, the United States arrests who they say is the primary suspect in the Benghazi attack.
[00:23:39.408 --> 00:23:40.929]  His name is Ahmed Abu Qatala.
[00:23:41.523 --> 00:23:46.146]  He's one of the senior leaders of Ansar al-Sharia, which within itself is very interesting, actually.
[00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:53.571]  Ansar al-Sharia is now considered a terrorist organization, but back in 2012, actually, the U.S.
[00:23:53.772 --> 00:24:07.281]  Special Mission, their quick reaction force inside our mission in Benghazi, the quick reaction force officially, I'm talking about, State Department sanctioned with something called the Martyrs of the February 17th Brigade.
[00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:14.431]  Which actually is an offshoot of Ansar al-Sharia, which took credit for the Benghazi attack, and we just captured their leader.
[00:24:14.491 --> 00:24:24.918]  So first, why in the world would we allow, as the official, I'm talking, like, officially State Department-sanctioned quick reaction force within the U.S.
[00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:30.762]  Benghazi mission was an Ansar al-Sharia offshoot, the martyrs of this February 17th Brigade.
[00:24:31.103 --> 00:24:35.946]  Now, Qatala, the senior leader, first, about a year ago,
[00:24:36.835 --> 00:24:41.056]  We, the United States, was actually hours from capturing this guy.
[00:24:41.476 --> 00:24:59.081]  And then, all of a sudden, in something that I have personally talked with members of the military, security officials in the United States, even senior politicians that come on my radio show all the time, they were astounded, perplexed, at a decision that Obama made, again, hours before.
[00:24:59.141 --> 00:25:02.262]  Special Forces following this guy last year, 2013, and then suddenly,
[00:25:03.917 --> 00:25:13.620]  Just hours before they can nab him, Obama calls for Special Forces also to get this other guy first, who has been wanted since the 1980s.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.401]  He's living openly in his home.
[00:25:15.541 --> 00:25:16.561]  Everybody knows where he is.
[00:25:17.562 --> 00:25:23.684]  So suddenly, Special Forces capture the other guy, his name is Al-Libi, first, in full public view.
[00:25:24.104 --> 00:25:25.865]  So this gets a lot of media attention.
[00:25:25.885 --> 00:25:26.625]  So what happens?
[00:25:27.085 --> 00:25:28.205]  Qatala goes underground.
[00:25:29.346 --> 00:25:32.507]  So that warden is captured, but all of a sudden Obama is now capturing him.
[00:25:33.453 --> 00:26:02.968]  I don't know why, but questions do need to be raised about the timing of all of this, and I have a new article out, actually, it's at WND right now, it's a police story, that Katala, get this, because we were talking about ISIS, the United States training some members, the very guy that we just arrested as the primary Benghazi suspect, according to my sources here, and I'm in Tel Aviv right now, but my sources are in the Middle East, beyond just Tel Aviv, Katala was working
[00:26:03.857 --> 00:26:05.798]  We're good to go.
[00:26:26.812 --> 00:26:42.387]  Do you think that the fact that he's essentially holding court with Reuters and CNN and the New York Times after the Benghazi attack, talking about being there, talking about what happened there, that he's essentially walking around freely and then all of a sudden
[00:26:43.287 --> 00:26:52.894]  This week, the Washington Post tries to paint this clandestine narrative that suddenly special operations swooped in and grabbed this guy while he was hiding.
[00:26:53.255 --> 00:26:55.176]  I mean, was he hiding in plain sight?
[00:26:55.656 --> 00:27:05.904]  It seems to me like there's different factions, as we've been told by Steve Pchenik, in the Benghazi attack itself, these were different factions of the CIA and the American government essentially
[00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:17.030]  Working on different scripts, working at odds with each other, and maybe one of them wants to use this guy as a tool, the other one wants to get him because they think that he's involved in this attack.
[00:27:17.751 --> 00:27:21.393]  Well, you know, I can't say what's going on behind the scenes or what the CIA is up to.
[00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:31.038]  I personally don't think that Qatala himself knows that he was working with this access of the Saudis, Qatar, Kuwait, to recruit rebels that included America.
[00:27:31.358 --> 00:27:33.980]  In other words, I don't think necessarily that he
[00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:41.720]  Well, you know, it's very easy.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.261]  We talk about compartmentalization.
[00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:48.403]  When you've got terrorist cells, there's probably nothing that's any easier to compartmentalize.
[00:27:48.443 --> 00:27:58.806]  These guys have their mission, they have their hardcore beliefs, they hate America or whatever, but they may not realize that the guy is a level or two levels up from them that are sending them some information.
[00:27:59.106 --> 00:28:01.047]  You know, maybe they're working with the CIA.
[00:28:02.182 --> 00:28:08.866]  Or it could be that they were working with cutouts, like the Saudis are cut out from the Saudis, but that ultimately, yeah, the United States was involved.
[00:28:09.647 --> 00:28:10.367]  Very interesting.
[00:28:10.407 --> 00:28:11.968]  But we're playing with fire here.
[00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:15.250]  Look at Jordan, 2012, allowed this training base.
[00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:22.955]  Actually now, ISIS is threatening to behead the king of Jordan, because he's a usurper, they believe he's anti-Islam.
[00:28:22.975 --> 00:28:26.097]  Look at the Saudis now funding ISIS.
[00:28:26.218 --> 00:28:29.820]  Actually, very dangerous for them at the end of the day, because ISIS also,
[00:28:30.379 --> 00:28:35.483]  She's the kingdom of Saudi Arabia as usurpers of the Islamic caliphate and of Islamic land.
[00:28:36.383 --> 00:28:38.124]  And same thing with the United States.
[00:28:38.265 --> 00:28:50.813]  If indeed, and we did, I have no doubt that we, the United States, until the Benghazi attack at least, were arming, training, and funding rebels that included these jihadists, possibly linked to al-Qaeda.
[00:28:51.053 --> 00:28:52.074]  So there's no doubt we did that.
[00:28:52.134 --> 00:28:54.076]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[00:28:54.156 --> 00:28:56.157]  And the original question that you asked is,
[00:28:56.833 --> 00:28:58.173]  I don't know.
[00:29:22.606 --> 00:29:24.447]  Borders now between Iraq and Syria.
[00:29:24.507 --> 00:29:26.668]  I mean, ISIS is going back and forth.
[00:29:26.908 --> 00:29:28.268]  They don't believe in borders.
[00:29:28.888 --> 00:29:30.629]  They believe in Islamic caliphate.
[00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:31.930]  Of course, they're not going to get what they want.
[00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.710]  They're just, you know, being used temporarily.
[00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.411]  They have no long-term strategy.
[00:29:36.511 --> 00:29:39.732]  ISIS is not going to form a government there.
[00:29:40.393 --> 00:29:41.713]  They're just temporary players.
[00:29:41.793 --> 00:29:46.875]  And in all of this, let's not forget oil, gas, economic interest.
[00:29:47.095 --> 00:29:48.416]  And Libya, huge, actually.
[00:29:48.996 --> 00:29:49.376]  Iraq.
[00:29:49.656 --> 00:29:50.817]  Iraq-Iran pipeline.
[00:29:51.197 --> 00:29:51.597]  Syria.
[00:29:52.028 --> 00:29:57.210]  pipeline that was competing between the Saudis and the Iranians, the Sunnis and the Shiites.
[00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:02.692]  So, a lot of this, I think, personally has to do with resources, natural resources.
[00:30:02.872 --> 00:30:03.473]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:30:03.793 --> 00:30:15.298]  Yeah, the caliphate is this dream that they're feeding to the fundamentalist Muslims, and yet the dream that the people who are pulling all these strings have is hegemony of the oil in the area.
[00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:21.100]  Yeah, but what's going to happen when the Islamists realize that they've been played?
[00:30:21.516 --> 00:30:26.417]  These are Islamists that have anti-aircraft missiles, and they don't need to bring them to New York.
[00:30:26.437 --> 00:30:28.758]  They're passenger aircraft that take off all the time.
[00:30:29.438 --> 00:30:33.118]  American passenger aircraft in North Africa and elsewhere.
[00:30:33.138 --> 00:30:44.101]  And don't forget, actually, that there are a lot of foreign jihadists, as in Americans, as in Australians, hundreds from Europe as well, that are fighting now with the rebels that we're helping.
[00:30:44.201 --> 00:30:45.501]  So they have passports.
[00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:50.062]  What happens if we didn't screen all of them and some of them come back into the United States?
[00:30:50.447 --> 00:30:53.708]  So, that's why this is a dangerous, dangerous game.
[00:30:54.189 --> 00:30:55.089]  Also, for Israel.
[00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:11.376]  Originally, Israel kind of supported the insurgency in Syria, and now they realize, oops, it's now a major threat, the jihadists, the rebels, to Israel's borders from Jordan, Syria, and beyond.
[00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:14.638]  And we, the United States, I think are going to ultimately learn our lesson.
[00:31:16.219 --> 00:31:19.300]  I don't think we'll ever learn our lesson, but I think that the Dakota,
[00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:20.532]  Jeremiah, you're right.
[00:31:20.793 --> 00:31:22.979]  Our chickens are going to come home to roost this time.
[00:31:23.601 --> 00:31:24.864]  And I think it could work 9-11.
[00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.751]  Yeah, it's a very, very dangerous game.
[00:31:27.811 --> 00:31:29.471]  It's a game they've been playing a long time.
[00:31:29.851 --> 00:31:38.834]  We've had nothing but continuous war since the end of World War II with these kind of games, and yet we see it escalating both in scope and in depth.
[00:31:39.234 --> 00:31:47.016]  It seems like they can always go in, just like McCain can, talk to these guys and say, you know, well, they were good, and then somehow they turn bad like Manuel Noriega.
[00:31:47.036 --> 00:31:53.318]  They get these criminals, these drug dealers, these terrorists, and then they say, well, they turned on us, so now we've got to take them out.
[00:31:53.738 --> 00:32:04.561]  There's always an excuse to keep everything off balance, to keep us in a state of continuous chaos, while they move around to gain control of areas, to gain control of resources.
[00:32:04.981 --> 00:32:10.422]  Well, thank you so much for talking to us, Aaron Klein, and that's AaronKlein.com?
[00:32:11.422 --> 00:32:12.322]  Yeah, KleinOnline.com.
[00:32:12.382 --> 00:32:23.125]  I'll just quickly add, because you mentioned, McCain, that I think ultimately it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with the GOP probe of Benghazi, because this was the Iran-Contra, this,
[00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:24.090]  I don't know.
[00:32:49.744 --> 00:32:50.845]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[00:32:51.185 --> 00:32:58.552]  So Obama's got his Iran-Contra, as well as his Watergate, as well as just about a clone of every other scandal we've ever had.
[00:32:58.872 --> 00:33:01.715]  Thank you so much for joining us from Jerusalem, from Tel Aviv, right?
[00:33:02.415 --> 00:33:03.016]  Yeah, Tel Aviv.
[00:33:03.156 --> 00:33:03.876]  Thank you, thank you.
[00:33:04.037 --> 00:33:04.297]  Bye-bye.
[00:33:05.714 --> 00:33:08.435]  And again, that's KleinOnline.com.

[00:33:16.819 --> 00:33:26.864]  Of course, their interest is constant chaos, constant instability, whether you're talking about states and wars, because they make money off of that, or even in economic markets.
[00:33:27.544 --> 00:33:28.825]  Well, that's it for tonight's news.
[00:33:28.885 --> 00:33:31.186]  Please join us tomorrow at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[00:33:31.246 --> 00:33:31.526]  Eastern.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.601]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:33:48.882 --> 00:33:58.671]  Hey, I just want to make you aware of the fact that the organization you work for, the Border Patrol, is funding illegals coming into our country completely illegally.
[00:33:58.731 --> 00:33:59.392]  Are you aware of that?
[00:33:59.632 --> 00:34:00.233]  I am aware of that.
[00:34:00.653 --> 00:34:01.834]  We gotta talk to somebody else.
[00:34:04.637 --> 00:34:12.144]  We've been down in South Texas and we've been doing a report on you guys for the past four days and I have
[00:34:12.813 --> 00:34:30.311]  Footage here of the illegals coming in, but basically we found out yesterday that Border Patrol, and it's not you guys, you guys are just doing your job, but the people that manage you guys, Homeland Security, has been paying for illegal citizens to come into the U.S.
[00:34:30.371 --> 00:34:33.494]  and paying for them to be spread out into the U.S.
[00:34:33.554 --> 00:34:35.977]  People that are committed crimes,
[00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:39.320]  Illegal citizens.
[00:34:40.141 --> 00:34:45.186]  So, we got chased around by border patrol because we're American journalists.
[00:34:45.766 --> 00:34:55.295]  Meanwhile, we're filming illegal citizens being paid for with my tax dollars and your tax dollars to come into our country and wreak havoc.
[00:34:55.536 --> 00:34:58.679]  So, I just want to make you guys aware of that.
[00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:01.982]  As a citizen of the United States, that's happening.
[00:35:02.202 --> 00:35:02.923]  We're aware of you.
[00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:06.581]  And, you know, the American people won't stand for it.
[00:35:07.142 --> 00:35:09.844]  As you stated, we're doing our job.
[00:35:09.984 --> 00:35:15.808]  We're not going to be able to change any policy or anything at the national level.
[00:35:16.249 --> 00:35:21.532]  But it's putting your organization and homeland security in the light of an invading army.
[00:35:22.413 --> 00:35:24.375]  And within our borders.
[00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:25.976]  As if you guys are the invaders.
[00:35:26.016 --> 00:35:27.617]  So I just wanted you guys to be aware of that.
[00:35:27.657 --> 00:35:28.718]  You may be aware of that already.
[00:35:29.078 --> 00:35:30.039]  You guys have a great day.
