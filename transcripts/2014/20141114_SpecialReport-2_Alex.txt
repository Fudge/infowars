[00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.624]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:14.026]  How in the world can this be HIPAA compliant?
[00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:26.854]  HIPAA is designed to protect the patient's privacy and this explicitly says in order to continue you have to accept this condition that you have no privacy or no reasonable expectation of privacy.
[00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:32.277]  Three different people were given access to her account, her address, and her social security number.
[00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:35.333]  And John Kerry said, no, no, no, we're not going to tax your health insurance.
[00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:37.294]  We're going to tax those evil insurance companies.
[00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:40.516]  We're going to impose a tax that if they sell health insurance, it's too expensive.
[00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:41.216]  We're going to tax them.
[00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:44.999]  And conveniently, the tax rate will happen to be the marginal tax rate under the Income Tax Code.
[00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:47.320]  So basically, it's the same thing.
[00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:49.161]  We just tax the insurance companies.
[00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:50.462]  They pass on higher prices.
[00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:52.203]  That offsets the tax break we get.
[00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:53.564]  It ends up being the same thing.
[00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:59.248]  It's a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.
[00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:11.111]  Well, first off, the bill has ten years of tax increases, about half a trillion dollars, with ten years of Medicare cuts, about half a trillion dollars, to pay for six years of spending.
[00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.012]  We will keep this promise to the American people.
[00:01:15.893 --> 00:01:19.214]  If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor.
[00:01:19.694 --> 00:01:19.994]  Period.
[00:01:20.886 --> 00:01:32.573]  But for the average person, many folks who don't have health insurance initially, they're going to have to make some choices and they might end up having to switch doctors in part because they're saving money.
[00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:44.929]  That's the interesting thing about the bill, all 2,000 pages of it, it's a gigantic blank check.
[00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:49.151]  Their insurance is stronger, better, more secure than it was before.
[00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:50.372]  Premiums go up.
[00:01:51.192 --> 00:01:53.053]  Employers are not going to want to pay those premiums.
[00:01:53.093 --> 00:01:56.915]  They're going to pass on as much as possible to the employee.
[00:01:56.955 --> 00:01:59.496]  We said, well, that's pretty much the same thing, so why is it a matter of it?
[00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:00.016]  You'll see.
[00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.497]  And they're opposed to that pass.
[00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:03.943]  This AmeriCorps is too stupid to understand the difference.
[00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.563]  This AmeriCorps is too stupid to understand the difference.
[00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:08.284]  It's real cost control and we know it'll work.
[00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:08.924]  Go after this.
[00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:11.625]  Now the problem is, it's a political nightmare.
[00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.885]  And people say, no, you can't tax my benefits.
[00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:20.487]  It feels like... So, what we did in that room was think about, well, how could... talk about, well, how could we make this work?
[00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:22.108]  And Obama's like, well, you know...
[00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:23.768]  I mean, he's really a realistic guy.
[00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:25.149]  He's like, look, I can't just do this.
[00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.989]  He said, it's just not going to happen politically.
[00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.749]  The bill will not pass.
[00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.450]  How do we manage to get there through phasings and other things?
[00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.230]  And we talked about it.
[00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.031]  And he was just very interested in that topic.
[00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:42.853]  And once again, that ultimately became the genesis of what's called the Cadillac Tax in the health care bill, which I think is one of the most important and bravest parts of the health care law.
[00:02:43.693 --> 00:02:45.775]  And, um, doesn't get nearly enough credit.
[00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:48.438]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[00:02:49.058 --> 00:02:52.202]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:56.566]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:05.205]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
