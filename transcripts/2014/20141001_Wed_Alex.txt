[00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.181]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:11.761]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.302]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:17.503]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:21.585]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.657 --> 00:00:33.119]  It's Wednesday, October 1st, 2014.
[00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:35.141]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:37.362]  I'm your fill-in host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:47.849]  But Alex will be joining us at 10 past the hour, because of course we've got huge breaking news regarding Ebola, the unprecedented first outbreak in the United States.
[00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:49.450]  We've also got Joe Biggs reporting.
[00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.236]  Live from the scene, Ground Zero at the Texas Hospital with a special report there with Josh Owens that he's filmed today.
[00:00:57.236 --> 00:01:08.066]  Also, Gerald Solente coming up in the third hour to talk about the latest financial situation and Bitcoin, we've got callers coming up on Ebola in the second hour as well.
[00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.147]  Of course, the latest news is that now they're saying...
[00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:14.871]  There is likely a second patient infected with Ebola.
[00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:28.263]  We've had officials give interviews on Texas television this morning saying that one of the family members of the Ebola victim, who was confirmed as having the virus yesterday in Dallas, has also likely been exposed.
[00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:30.325]  That's not been confirmed yet, but they're now saying that.
[00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:36.775]  It is indeed possible that a second family member has been exposed to the Ebola virus.
[00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:46.224]  Basically the timeline which we need to go through is that the patient arrived in Dallas on a flight from Liberia on September the 20th showing no symptoms of the disease.
[00:01:46.224 --> 00:01:53.371]  Obviously we know that it could take up to three weeks for the symptoms to actually develop, to actually show in the case of an Ebola sufferer.
[00:01:54.292 --> 00:02:03.455]  He started feeling sick September 24th, visited his doctor or a hospital, we're not sure which yet, on September 26th.
[00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:06.256]  And this is the key here, this is what's amazing about this story.
[00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:11.698]  He was given antibiotics on September 26th after showing symptoms for two days.
[00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:29.773]  And immediately sent home, even though he had travelled from Liberia, and this is what's causing a lot of condemnation directed towards health officials in Texas this morning, which is the fact that this individual had the symptoms, had Ebola for two days, he was sent home.
[00:02:30.413 --> 00:02:35.916]  Basically he was walking amongst the population for four days with this virus.
[00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:39.037]  And now you see the article up on Infowars.com.
[00:02:39.037 --> 00:02:42.239]  Texas Ebola patient was sent home for two days with antibiotics.
[00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.220]  So he already had the virus two days before that.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.362]  He's been walking around Dallas, Texas for four days.
[00:02:49.362 --> 00:02:50.363]  Obviously Ebola
[00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:53.264]  They say at the moment is not airborne.
[00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:56.967]  Other scientific research suggests that it may well be.
[00:02:56.967 --> 00:03:04.571]  But for at least four days he was active in the Dallas area amongst the community, amongst his family members.
[00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.013]  And again CDC concerned about airborne transmission of Ebola virus.
[00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:16.538]  Of course we had the Canadian study back in 2012 which proved that Ebola could be transmitted via the air from pigs to monkeys.
[00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:18.599]  We've had several top officials go public
[00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:28.362]  Over the last few weeks, including a major editorial in the New York Times saying that health officials are concerned that it could have mutated, that it could have gone airborne.
[00:03:28.362 --> 00:03:32.863]  No confirmation of that so far, but it's obviously of concern.
[00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:34.444]  We're going to play some clips coming up.
[00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:41.646]  We've got Zachariah Thompson, the director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, who gave an interview with WFAA this morning.
[00:03:42.446 --> 00:03:53.953]  Confirming, or basically suggesting, indicating that there was a second Ebola case, one of the family members of the victim that's there in the Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.
[00:03:53.953 --> 00:04:00.418]  Also, Sanjay Gupta, Dr. Sanjay Gupta gave an interview on CNN, which we're going to play a little later if we have time.
[00:04:01.363 --> 00:04:22.021]  Which in which he said the four-day period where this Ebola patient was walking around Dallas was quote a significant period of time and he made the point that although this is transmitted via bodily fluids it could be transmitted merely by shaking the hand of an Ebola victim so you gotta think you know this this guy's been
[00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:27.185]  Walking around Texas, Dallas for four days without being isolated.
[00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:31.709]  As I said, September 24th was when he first showed symptoms.
[00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:36.693]  He was walking around Dallas and so that's why there are concerns that this could spread.
[00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.275]  Of course, the CDC is trying to dampen down the hysteria.
[00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:41.957]  We'll be back with Alex Jones after the break.
[00:04:41.957 --> 00:04:45.099]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:45.660]  Stay tuned.
[00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:00.656]  What are you waiting for?

[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:03.227]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:07.172]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.272]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:09.272 --> 00:06:17.134]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[00:06:58.857 --> 00:07:06.024]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:06.024 --> 00:07:08.387]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:13.652]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:13.652 --> 00:07:18.597]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:18.817 --> 00:07:22.138]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:22.138 --> 00:07:26.218]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:26.218 --> 00:07:30.539]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:40.761]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:45.182]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:07:45.182 --> 00:07:45.742]  The new MFOL

[00:08:12.907 --> 00:08:19.668]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:19.668 --> 00:08:23.289]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:30.070]  It's Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones on this Wednesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.230]  Of course, we've got the huge breaking Ebola news.
[00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:39.652]  It emerged last night that a first Ebola patient confirmed to have the virus in the United States, in Dallas.
[00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:41.072]  We're going to go to a clip now, which is...
[00:08:41.952 --> 00:08:53.236]  The likelihood that a second patient has been infected, one of the family members of this individual in Dallas, and this is Zachariah Thompson, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services.
[00:08:53.236 --> 00:08:58.698]  He gave an interview with WFAA and he said that there's likely to be a second case.
[00:08:58.698 --> 00:08:59.458]  Here's that clip.
[00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.106]  And this is the Dallas address he was at.
[00:09:02.106 --> 00:09:06.890]  As a parent, a lot of parents want to know, these children, are they going to school?
[00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.672]  Are you going to be talking with the schools about how to handle this?
[00:09:09.672 --> 00:09:22.881]  That's priority number one in our meeting this morning is to ensure we've already dialogued with the ISD and so the precaution is to keep the children home and we will evaluate and they will be monitored.
[00:09:22.881 --> 00:09:25.262]  Let me be real frank to the Dallas County residents.
[00:09:25.262 --> 00:09:27.324]  The fact that we have one confirmed case
[00:09:28.004 --> 00:09:33.631]  There may be another case that is a close associate with this particular patient.
[00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:35.573]  So I want to be frank.
[00:09:35.573 --> 00:09:36.754]  This is real.
[00:09:36.754 --> 00:09:37.936]  There should be a concern.
[00:09:37.936 --> 00:09:42.541]  But it's contained to the Pacific family members and close friends at this moment.
[00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:42.862]  All right.
[00:09:42.862 --> 00:09:44.444]  We certainly appreciate your time.
[00:09:44.924 --> 00:09:55.448]  That is Zachariah Thompson, Health and Human Services official, who basically acknowledged the fact that it's very likely there's a second Ebola case, one of the family members of the victims.
[00:09:55.448 --> 00:10:00.130]  But live on the line now with more breaking Ebola news is Alex Jones.
[00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.910]  Alex, welcome to the show.
[00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.971]  Absolutely, Paul.
[00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:06.012]  Now, I've been explaining to people from the beginning
[00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:10.478]  That I've seen major signs of scripting to all of this.
[00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:15.021]  And when I say scripting, I don't mean the Dallas County or Dallas City officials.
[00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:18.363]  I don't mean 99.9% of people in our own government.
[00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:25.527]  But major scripting at the CDC, at the Obama Administration level, and at the United Nations level.
[00:10:25.527 --> 00:10:26.888]  We've been saying this for several months.
[00:10:26.888 --> 00:10:34.772]  It is unprecedented to bring dozens and dozens of hot, infected
[00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:42.714]  Patient number one, ground zero, Ebola victims into the United States.
[00:10:42.714 --> 00:10:50.280]  It used to show up in three days, it shows up in 22 days now, meaning someone can spread and spread and spread.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.501]  The default
[00:10:52.661 --> 00:11:04.849]  It was a Level 4 containment, illegal, and those laws are still in the books, to bring someone with smallpox or Ebola or anything of that nature into the United States.
[00:11:04.849 --> 00:11:05.149]  U.S.
[00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:15.796]  citizens were to be held in quarantine on Navy ships, special medical ships that they have, and other facilities they have in places in Sierra Leone and other areas.
[00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:16.777]  This is unprecedented.
[00:11:16.777 --> 00:11:19.379]  We have top virologists in Bild in Germany.
[00:11:20.342 --> 00:11:22.103]  I think 5 million will get it by December.
[00:11:22.103 --> 00:11:23.504]  The U.N.
[00:11:23.504 --> 00:11:25.425]  says 1.4 million.
[00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:29.127]  Most top virologists say it's beginning to go slightly airborne.
[00:11:29.127 --> 00:11:34.891]  That means it isn't hardy airborne, but it is clearly leaning towards being somewhat airborne.
[00:11:35.997 --> 00:11:39.722]  If that is the case, that's why we're seeing this huge outbreak in Africa.
[00:11:39.722 --> 00:11:43.106]  You've got seven nations now with it over in Africa.
[00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:50.815]  You have got tens of thousands of people a week flying in and out of West Africa, into every major city in the world.
[00:11:51.355 --> 00:11:59.507]  And there should have already been a quarantine on Sierra Leone, and a quarantine on Ghana, and a quarantine on these other countries.
[00:11:59.507 --> 00:12:01.309]  That was standard procedure.
[00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:05.676]  It is a guarantee that you will get Ebola all over the world.
[00:12:06.374 --> 00:12:10.315]  Guaranteed with a 22-day carrier incubation period.
[00:12:10.315 --> 00:12:13.537]  We've got top medical doctors on this, so this is not my opinion.
[00:12:13.537 --> 00:12:16.498]  That's why we kept saying this is insane.
[00:12:16.498 --> 00:12:19.178]  There should have been an immediate embargo.
[00:12:19.178 --> 00:12:26.281]  Those countries, Sierra Leone and others, are literally collapsing right now, but they're letting the airports still run.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.764]  As middle class and wealthy Africans and Westerners flee the nation.
[00:12:31.764 --> 00:12:36.748]  Then Obama injects 3,300 untrained U.S.
[00:12:36.748 --> 00:12:40.291]  troops into the middle of hell hot zones.
[00:12:40.291 --> 00:12:45.195]  We kept telling people months ago, we got attacked by the mainstream media because they didn't want people to be warmed up front.
[00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:53.522]  This had all the tell-tale signs of bare minimum allowing a crisis to get out of hand, aiding and abetting it, not letting a good crisis go to waste.
[00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:59.427]  We know there's laboratories in the U.S., England, Africa, and other areas that have souped up Ebola.
[00:12:59.427 --> 00:13:06.552]  We've played frontline pieces, NOVA pieces, admitting airborne Ebola escaped and killed monkeys in another lab in 1989.
[00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:07.192]  See, we're informed.
[00:13:09.844 --> 00:13:23.676]  And the system preys on the American people's ignorance to say, oh, don't listen to InfoWars, don't listen to Drudge, don't listen to WorldNetDaily, don't listen to those crazy people that actually have top scientists and medical doctors and virologists on.
[00:13:23.676 --> 00:13:30.342]  Oh, look, InfoWars is reporting on CDC medical journals two years ago saying Ebola had gone airborne.
[00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:31.403]  We got attacked.
[00:13:31.403 --> 00:13:35.707]  A month later, New York Times admitted they believe it's going airborne with a top virologist.
[00:13:35.707 --> 00:13:36.788]  The issue here is
[00:13:37.737 --> 00:13:42.099]  I'm in Austin, Texas, literally three hours from Dallas.
[00:13:42.099 --> 00:13:51.384]  Joe Biggs is up there outside the hospital area, where Rick Perry set to give a press conference at T-minus 45 minutes or so, about 47 minutes from now.
[00:13:51.384 --> 00:14:03.631]  This is very serious, because you have a huge Nigerian population, huge West African population in Dallas, and again, it's so politically correct
[00:14:04.275 --> 00:14:13.800]  That you've got the emergency managers in Dallas County openly saying, well, we're still going to tell the kids to stay home with this guy, but everything's okay.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:24.446]  That entire family, ladies and gentlemen, should be locked up in a quarantine facility watching television and having a nice day so an epidemic doesn't get out of hand.
[00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:31.230]  You get one person giving it to five, they give it to 10, they give it to 20, they give it to 40, they give it to 80, they give it to 100.
[00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.071]  You see the numbers going up.
[00:14:33.631 --> 00:14:38.473]  Once you get about 10 or 15 people that have this, it's going to be unstoppable.
[00:14:38.473 --> 00:14:45.235]  And you're going to have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, maybe billions of people with Ebola.
[00:14:45.235 --> 00:14:49.436]  And on record, I want it on record that we pointed this out.
[00:14:49.436 --> 00:14:50.577]  It's not hard to point this out.
[00:14:50.577 --> 00:14:51.477]  This is default.
[00:14:52.037 --> 00:14:53.738]  This is default.
[00:14:53.738 --> 00:15:05.805]  The minute there was a major outbreak, you shut down the aircraft coming in, or you make people sign a form that they will go on aircraft that everybody has been quarantined for at least a month once they get off of it.
[00:15:05.805 --> 00:15:09.907]  Instead, we knew the fix was in, so they would have plausible deniability a month ago.
[00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:18.791]  When they started flying all these medical workers in with Ebola and putting them in regular hospitals that aren't even level 2, level 3 containment.
[00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:21.052]  Ladies and gentlemen, that violates federal law.
[00:15:21.052 --> 00:15:22.633]  This is a disaster.
[00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:25.775]  They want to use this to roll out more homeland security.
[00:15:25.775 --> 00:15:27.156]  Do I think this is the end of the world?
[00:15:27.156 --> 00:15:27.796]  No.
[00:15:27.796 --> 00:15:29.477]  I predict that they're going to have phases
[00:15:30.237 --> 00:15:31.918]  Listeners, you've heard this hundreds of times.
[00:15:31.918 --> 00:15:41.766]  Phases of bio-releases, souped-up bio-weapon releases, to train us to go under medical tyranny, to train us to go under forced inoculation.
[00:15:41.766 --> 00:15:55.696]  So when they really release the deadly airborne Ebola or mousepox down the road to wipe out 90% of the population, a la 12 Monkeys, the people will do what they're told, believing that they were protected by the government in the first few big outbreaks.
[00:15:55.696 --> 00:15:58.198]  This is directly, directly
[00:15:59.136 --> 00:16:01.337]  Out of the globalist script, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:03.219]  Directly out of V for Vendetta.
[00:16:03.219 --> 00:16:06.260]  This is how you conquer America and conquer the world.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.841]  This is how you get the guns.
[00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:09.782]  This is how you bring in the tyranny.
[00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:11.804]  You bring in terrorists.
[00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.324]  Notice how Texas is under attack.
[00:16:13.324 --> 00:16:15.165]  Everyone's fleeing the rest of the country to come to Texas.
[00:16:15.165 --> 00:16:17.927]  We have lower taxes and are libertarian conservative.
[00:16:17.927 --> 00:16:20.689]  The border is wide open and they've targeted bringing in the buses.
[00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:22.291]  Texas.
[00:16:22.291 --> 00:16:25.032]  They've targeted Texas with all their different programs.
[00:16:25.032 --> 00:16:27.433]  Now Texas is where the Ebola's popping up.
[00:16:27.433 --> 00:16:30.575]  You can just see all of this going on.
[00:16:30.575 --> 00:16:40.139]  Ladies and gentlemen, and now Paul Watson comes to visit the U.S., the first time he's visited me here in nine years, or eight years, and now you're here in Texas.
[00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:41.519]  Paul Watson, 200 miles from Ebola.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.741]  We're good to go.
[00:16:59.494 --> 00:17:15.820]  Have now allowed dozens and dozens of people in with Ebola and did no screening at the airports for people coming in and out of West Africa with scientists saying 1.4 million with computer models are set to get it on the low end.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.721]  5 million now on the high end.
[00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:20.202]  That's by December.
[00:17:20.202 --> 00:17:23.483]  We're talking about, we're not talking about when they usually panic when 20 people have Ebola.
[00:17:23.943 --> 00:17:26.124]  I mean, the previous top outbreaks were a couple hundred.
[00:17:26.124 --> 00:17:34.908]  We're talking about countries collapsing right now, as people are hanging basically off the aircraft to fly here, and our government's going, come on in.
[00:17:34.908 --> 00:17:39.730]  So the bottom line is the government, whatever's behind this, cannot and will not protect you.
[00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.791]  You've got to protect yourselves.
[00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:47.393]  And it is so disgusting, like a slow-motion automobile accident, to be seeing this unfold right now.
[00:17:47.393 --> 00:17:50.855]  Folks better be hitting their knees and praying to God, because
[00:17:51.667 --> 00:18:20.166]  If this Ebola gets out, and if it spreads with our compromised immune systems here in the United States, and all the vaccines that people have been taking, and if it starts mutating with other things that are going on right now, and all the other mystery illnesses sweeping the country of kids that have been vaccinated, you can see with Dr. Bianca, a top eugenicist, saying eight years ago that soon the airborne Ebola is coming and will kill 90%, and 95% standing ovation at the Texas Academy of Sciences, with people crying with joy,
[00:18:20.828 --> 00:18:24.571]  Because he projected a huge screen of red skulls on the wall.
[00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.532]  This is mainstream news, folks.
[00:18:25.532 --> 00:18:26.453]  Look it up.
[00:18:26.453 --> 00:18:30.816]  The FBI went and talked to him about it, and they began crying in their death cult of victory.
[00:18:30.816 --> 00:18:32.177]  This is a death cult.
[00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:35.880]  They're listening in Austin right now at University of Texas.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.783]  They are the most sick people you could ever imagine.
[00:18:38.783 --> 00:18:39.904]  And I've been warning you.
[00:18:39.904 --> 00:18:44.327]  My film, Endgame, warns you that they are all over Ebola.
[00:18:44.327 --> 00:18:45.829]  The globalists have been messing with it.
[00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:48.936]  Screwing around with it constantly.
[00:18:48.936 --> 00:18:50.778]  This is one of their main arsenal weapons.
[00:18:50.778 --> 00:18:51.999]  So is mousepox.
[00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:54.001]  Kills 90 plus percent of people.
[00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:57.405]  And again, I don't think this is the big one.
[00:18:57.405 --> 00:18:59.046]  I don't think this is the big one.
[00:18:59.046 --> 00:19:01.749]  But it could be.
[00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:02.971]  I believe it's just a primer.
[00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:03.992]  Paul Watson, what do you think?
[00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:11.994]  Well, what I've noticed, Alex, is this kind of simpering and patronizing tone from the media this morning, just watching it on the television.
[00:19:11.994 --> 00:19:22.821]  You know, telling people not to panic, telling people that this hysteria, this outbreak is going to be limited, when they're the ones who attacked us for warning about it, you know, one, two months ago.
[00:19:22.821 --> 00:19:26.463]  CBS News put out a big hit piece against us.
[00:19:26.463 --> 00:19:27.524]  They dropped the ball.
[00:19:27.524 --> 00:19:30.446]  I mean, this patient was walking around in Dallas for four days.
[00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:34.188]  They didn't even ask him his travel history, where he came from.
[00:19:36.456 --> 00:19:37.997]  They didn't do status quo.
[00:19:37.997 --> 00:19:40.260]  They turned the defaults off.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.504]  Just like NORAD was ordered to stand down on 9-11.
[00:19:43.504 --> 00:19:48.890]  We'll be back after the break with more from Alex Jones, Joe Biggs coming up as well live from the scene.
[00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.634]  We've got Rick Perry's press conference coming up at noon.
[00:19:51.634 --> 00:19:54.597]  This is InfoWars.com breaking Ebola coverage.
[00:19:54.597 --> 00:19:55.118]  Stay tuned.
[00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:05.262]  Recent events have shown just how vulnerable we are to deadly viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:20:05.262 --> 00:20:11.067]  These diseases are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[00:20:11.067 --> 00:20:15.230]  Now more than ever, there's a great need for a product that will help protect us.
[00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.471]  Look no further.
[00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:21.275]  Supernatural Silver can provide immune system support to help fight off these deadly pathogens.
[00:20:21.895 --> 00:20:33.044]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that's safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold, and yeast.
[00:20:33.044 --> 00:20:39.308]  Supernatural Silver can be taken orally or used topically, and can be used in a nebulizer or vaporizer for inhalation.
[00:20:39.308 --> 00:20:47.855]  With over 180 scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, and research institutions, Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon against disease.
[00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:54.761]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com and use the promo code SILVER2014 for 20% off your entire order.
[00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:59.205]  Give you and your loved ones a fighting chance with Supernatural Silver.
[00:20:59.205 --> 00:21:02.368]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[00:21:02.368 --> 00:21:06.532]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:07.853]  What are you doing to prepare?
[00:21:07.853 --> 00:21:11.216]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[00:21:11.696 --> 00:21:13.257]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[00:21:13.257 --> 00:21:14.658]  The total amount of debt in the U.S.
[00:21:14.658 --> 00:21:19.100]  has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:30.306]  The too-big-to-fail banks are much larger, and the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming.
[00:21:30.626 --> 00:21:39.013]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street casino and start a cash-flowing international business of your own.
[00:21:39.013 --> 00:21:45.458]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can grow your wealth like having your own business.
[00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:46.699]  The crash is coming.
[00:21:46.699 --> 00:21:49.281]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[00:21:49.281 --> 00:21:52.063]  Go to BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[00:21:52.063 --> 00:21:53.364]  That's BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[00:21:58.772 --> 00:21:59.812]  DNA Force.
[00:21:59.812 --> 00:22:03.074]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:22:03.074 --> 00:22:04.234]  DNA Force.
[00:22:04.234 --> 00:22:12.337]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:22:12.337 --> 00:22:17.379]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:18.419]  DNA Force.
[00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:20.400]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:22:28.383 --> 00:22:38.926]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:22:38.926 --> 00:22:45.367]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:47.708]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:22:47.708 --> 00:22:50.788]  I look forward to waking up and taking my Super Male Vitality.
[00:22:50.788 --> 00:22:57.630]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.875]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:23:01.875 --> 00:23:07.402]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:23:07.402 --> 00:23:09.765]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:23:12.598 --> 00:23:16.882]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:23:16.882 --> 00:23:19.003]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:23:19.003 --> 00:23:22.286]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:23.506]  Children left with no home.
[00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:25.368]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:23:25.368 --> 00:23:28.210]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:28.610]  I think so.
[00:24:19.042 --> 00:24:26.051]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show this Wednesday, October 1st edition with me, Paul Joseph Watson, talking to Alex Jones.
[00:24:26.051 --> 00:24:32.579]  Reuters just reported experts question two-day delay in admitting Texas Ebola patients.
[00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:33.640]  So as I said before the break...
[00:24:34.301 --> 00:24:37.043]  This guy was basically walking around Dallas for four days.
[00:24:37.043 --> 00:24:43.168]  He got antibiotics two days before they isolated him, so he went in to get treatment.
[00:24:43.168 --> 00:24:50.655]  They asked no questions whatsoever of his travel history, which numerous health professionals are questioning this morning.
[00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:54.997]  We also have an article out of Infowars.com, actually.
[00:24:54.997 --> 00:24:55.278]  U.N.
[00:24:55.278 --> 00:24:59.060]  says Ebola outbreak worse than HIV SARS.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:08.006]  This is David Nabarro, who heads up the United Nations Ebola response, told the Sydney Morning Herald that Ebola is the scariest disease he has ever encountered during his career.
[00:25:08.786 --> 00:25:15.552]  I can remember in Africa early on in HIV thinking this is an unspeakably awful situation but it will not decimate the population.
[00:25:15.552 --> 00:25:23.979]  So he's now saying that this could be worse than HIV for Africa, which has obviously killed millions and millions of people.
[00:25:23.979 --> 00:25:36.550]  We had the top German virologist a couple of weeks ago saying that Ebola basically could burn itself out in West Africa, Liberia, Sierra Leone and not stop until it's claimed basically all of the population.
[00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.732]  Alex Jones, more comments on this breaking Ebola news?
[00:25:40.732 --> 00:25:50.158]  I mean, the question that I've got, Alex, is that British Airways stopped all the flights from West Africa going into Britain, and yet the United States basically did nothing.
[00:25:51.789 --> 00:26:01.477]  Well, look, it's because the globalists are clearly behind this, or it's like a wildfire's coming and they want the firefighters to stand down because they want to destroy a neighborhood and build condos on it.
[00:26:01.477 --> 00:26:03.719]  Either way, the government is behind this.
[00:26:03.719 --> 00:26:19.933]  Either way, the defaults, and any emergency manager listening, any hazmat person listening, any CDC person listening, any health department person listening, any medical doctor listening, any nurse listening, anyone who's informed, and I want to get some articles out about this, just showing the previous defaults.
[00:26:20.931 --> 00:26:22.312]  You do what France did.
[00:26:22.312 --> 00:26:23.232]  You do what England did.
[00:26:23.232 --> 00:26:24.153]  You do what others do.
[00:26:24.153 --> 00:26:27.074]  You do what Saudi Arabia did a month and a half ago.
[00:26:27.074 --> 00:26:30.735]  When they had an Ebola patient show up, you shut the flights down.
[00:26:30.735 --> 00:26:34.677]  Or you warn people, there's going to be a major fee associated with this.
[00:26:34.677 --> 00:26:36.358]  You're going to have to pay for it.
[00:26:36.358 --> 00:26:38.359]  We're going to put you in quarantine for a month.
[00:26:38.359 --> 00:26:40.760]  This is the default.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:47.223]  And then meanwhile, while there's Ebola outbreaks going on, the border is wide open, and Geraldo Rivera comes out and attacks Matt Drudge.
[00:26:48.234 --> 00:26:51.196]  And says, how dare you say Ebola could come into the U.S.?
[00:26:51.196 --> 00:26:53.037]  Well, guess what, Geraldo?
[00:26:53.037 --> 00:26:54.658]  And again, Geraldo says he's a listener.
[00:26:54.658 --> 00:26:55.639]  I've been on his show many times.
[00:26:55.639 --> 00:26:56.819]  He's been on ours.
[00:26:56.819 --> 00:26:59.701]  I don't want to attack him, but he's full of bull.
[00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:05.385]  We were not being racist against Hispanics because we pointed out it's insane to have wide open borders.
[00:27:05.385 --> 00:27:10.148]  We were pointing it out because it shows how the government is literally out of control.
[00:27:10.148 --> 00:27:12.049]  This is why this is happening.
[00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:13.290]  Until about 20 years ago.
[00:27:14.318 --> 00:27:16.759]  If government screwed up, people got fired.
[00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:18.940]  And that's been the way it's always been.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.560]  Okay?
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.361]  If a Roman general lost a battle, he got fired or executed.
[00:27:22.361 --> 00:27:23.121]  Okay?
[00:27:23.121 --> 00:27:25.022]  If a captain did something wrong, they got in trouble.
[00:27:25.022 --> 00:27:26.382]  If a centurion got in trouble.
[00:27:26.382 --> 00:27:28.003]  This is thousands of years old.
[00:27:28.003 --> 00:27:32.664]  When they screw up in Katrina and order a stand-down, FEMA gets double the funding, gets to take the guns.
[00:27:32.664 --> 00:27:37.126]  On 9-11, when NORAD stands down, and the NSA's on everybody, they get...
[00:27:37.626 --> 00:27:44.232]  Five times the fundings, or even more since then, for different federal departments and the police state bureaucracy.
[00:27:44.232 --> 00:27:46.134]  So no one gets in trouble.
[00:27:46.134 --> 00:27:54.962]  So they'll get a bunch of power and control and the Military Industrial Complex Medical Center and Obamacare will come in with a federal emergency and declare their big victory.
[00:27:55.562 --> 00:27:56.142]  We're good to go.
[00:28:08.544 --> 00:28:14.149]  Like Godzilla attacking Tokyo to destroy America while sucking us dry.
[00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:19.033]  It is a premeditated plan to bring down the country.
[00:28:19.033 --> 00:28:21.935]  The globalists are following Agenda 21.
[00:28:21.935 --> 00:28:26.739]  Cloward and Pivot is only one small sociological example of their plan.
[00:28:26.739 --> 00:28:29.181]  I mention that because people know what Cloward and Pivot is.
[00:28:29.181 --> 00:28:31.163]  Bottom line, there is zero debate.
[00:28:31.163 --> 00:28:32.484]  No one can debate me.
[00:28:32.484 --> 00:28:34.105]  I challenge people to debate me.
[00:28:34.105 --> 00:28:36.387]  I challenge folks to call in the next hour when David Knight is
[00:28:37.087 --> 00:28:49.658]  I challenge somebody to try to call in here and tell us how they didn't either cook it up and let it come in here, or how they didn't order a stand-down to let it come in here.
[00:28:49.658 --> 00:28:50.558]  They did it.
[00:28:50.558 --> 00:28:58.925]  And I want Rick Perry to be asked at the press conference, are you going to challenge Obama to shut down the flights out of West Africa?
[00:28:58.925 --> 00:29:01.247]  That's what Rick Perry needs to be asked by the media.
[00:29:01.247 --> 00:29:03.749]  I guarantee you nobody is going to bring that up.
[00:29:03.749 --> 00:29:04.950]  That's a governor's job.
[00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.711]  He hit with Ebola.
[00:29:06.531 --> 00:29:24.601]  He's just saying to the President, Mr. President, order flights out of West Africa shut down now, and people that have bounced in from other countries with a West African original epicenter where they came from, if they're originating out of West Africa, they need to be put on quarantine.
[00:29:24.601 --> 00:29:27.323]  And if you're coming to America, you're going to be quarantined, because here's the problem.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:37.765]  Once they let it get out of hand, they're going to start quarantining everybody with Obama's executive order, claiming if you have any respiratory illness, you can be locked up forever, which they've never done before.
[00:29:37.765 --> 00:29:38.726]  That was two months ago.
[00:29:38.726 --> 00:29:40.747]  We said, folks, get ready.
[00:29:40.747 --> 00:29:42.828]  Now a respiratory thing has popped up.
[00:29:42.828 --> 00:29:46.050]  This thing stinks to high heaven, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.711]  This is an emergency situation.
[00:29:48.812 --> 00:29:50.195]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.195 --> 00:29:52.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.946]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.946 --> 00:29:58.111]  That's the only chance we've got to make them do their job.
[00:29:59.622 --> 00:30:09.285]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[00:30:09.285 --> 00:30:19.007]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:19.207 --> 00:30:29.591]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[00:30:29.591 --> 00:30:34.252]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[00:30:34.252 --> 00:30:36.493]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[00:30:36.693 --> 00:30:39.235]  And there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[00:30:39.235 --> 00:30:44.921]  Instead, OxyPowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:50.266]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[00:30:50.266 --> 00:30:55.751]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[00:30:55.751 --> 00:30:56.231]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:30:59.833 --> 00:31:01.094]  Another major health threat.
[00:31:01.094 --> 00:31:06.076]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:31:06.076 --> 00:31:08.737]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:31:08.737 --> 00:31:15.780]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.761]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:31:18.761 --> 00:31:21.802]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:31:21.802 --> 00:31:23.743]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:31:23.743 --> 00:31:26.584]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:31:26.664 --> 00:31:32.385]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:31:32.385 --> 00:31:35.886]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:31:35.886 --> 00:31:38.987]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:31:38.987 --> 00:31:46.308]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:31:46.308 --> 00:31:49.529]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:55.790]  Go to infowarsstore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System.
[00:31:55.990 --> 00:32:00.033]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:32:00.033 --> 00:32:06.678]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:06.678 --> 00:32:11.822]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:11.822 --> 00:32:20.549]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:22.851]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:32:24.622 --> 00:32:26.750]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:32:29.045 --> 00:32:33.647]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:32:33.647 --> 00:32:38.710]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.851]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:42.632]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:42.632 --> 00:32:45.513]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:32:45.513 --> 00:32:52.157]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:32:52.157 --> 00:32:54.858]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:32:54.858 --> 00:32:58.080]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:33:12.138 --> 00:33:14.246]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.246 --> 00:33:16.254]  Because there is a war on.
[00:33:16.254 --> 00:33:16.917]  Or you're mine.
[00:33:29.656 --> 00:33:37.081]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show this Wednesday, October the 1st, 2014, talking about the breaking Ebola news.
[00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:38.922]  Alex Jones is still on the line.
[00:33:38.922 --> 00:33:43.685]  We're still waiting to connect with Joe Biggs, who is live on the scene in Dallas.
[00:33:43.685 --> 00:33:46.947]  We've got Governor Rick Perry coming up with a press conference.
[00:33:46.947 --> 00:33:57.074]  And we're basically urging both Perry and our listeners to call the White House and urge them to cease all flights from West Africa into the United States.
[00:33:57.734 --> 00:34:03.318]  British Airways, this is an article from back in August, August 27th out of the Daily Mail.
[00:34:03.318 --> 00:34:08.081]  British Airways halts flights to Ebola-hit Sierra Leone and Liberia for the rest of the year.
[00:34:08.081 --> 00:34:13.524]  And it's not only Britain that did that over a month ago, Air France did the same.
[00:34:13.524 --> 00:34:22.270]  Emirates, the huge airline company out of the United Arab Emirates, also halted flights into the country from these Ebola-hit countries.
[00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:26.873]  Yes, now for more than a month the United States failed to do so.
[00:34:26.873 --> 00:34:35.979]  We have the first Ebola patient now almost confirmation, I think it actually has been confirmed, or at least the likelihood of a second Ebola victim.
[00:34:35.979 --> 00:34:43.385]  One of the family members of the individual that's there in the Texas Presbyterian Hospital at which we've got our reporters live on the scene.
[00:34:43.385 --> 00:34:48.048]  But Alex, we're putting out the call both for our listeners and for the media.
[00:34:48.348 --> 00:35:04.296]  To urge the White House to order this cancellation of flights from West Africa, because we've seen in an article from Defence One this morning, which is up on the Drudge Report, there's really no way to screen for Ebola at airports, because we know it's got a three-week period.
[00:35:04.816 --> 00:35:14.118]  Where somebody could show no symptoms whatsoever, and the temperature scans that people could go through at the airports are basically completely useless, it's admitted.
[00:35:14.118 --> 00:35:18.578]  In this article, they didn't work back in 2009 for the swine flu outbreak.
[00:35:18.578 --> 00:35:20.339]  They're not going to work with Ebola.
[00:35:20.339 --> 00:35:24.720]  So the only solution, it seems, is to stop those flights coming in, Alex.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.600]  Well, that's right, Paul.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.980]  You're absolutely correct.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:32.681]  And, again, our media is so lapdog, so controlled, so insane, so pathetic,
[00:35:33.254 --> 00:35:38.117]  That when we pointed out a month and a half ago we should cease flights, they attacked us in publications everywhere.
[00:35:38.117 --> 00:35:49.745]  This is what they do, because they want to get it in the country, get the crisis going, use it as a power grab, use it as a destabilization program, and then the feds and the globalists can again play the part of the saviors.
[00:35:49.745 --> 00:35:58.110]  This is a classic divide and conquer, order out of chaos, Hegelian dialectic program, and there's no debating it, and so,
[00:35:58.928 --> 00:36:02.070]  We need to get the phone number of the White House out just so they know we know.
[00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.251]  We need to get the number out to Rick Perry's office.
[00:36:04.251 --> 00:36:06.732]  We've got our reporters there on the ground with their mic up on the stand.
[00:36:06.732 --> 00:36:10.794]  They're going to get a question into Perry in Dallas coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:36:10.794 --> 00:36:17.418]  I don't care what break it is, we skip it once Perry starts speaking and going to those questions because this is so important.
[00:36:17.418 --> 00:36:19.899]  And it's not just because this is in Texas.
[00:36:19.899 --> 00:36:23.961]  I was saying, you know, shut down the flights long before it hit my state and my hometown.
[00:36:25.326 --> 00:36:34.611]  This is a serious situation, to say the least, because if we don't get this contained, they will use it to take so much control and it could really start spreading.
[00:36:34.611 --> 00:36:43.776]  And of course, undoubtedly, if he was here for four days sick with Ebola, walking around around his family and so many others, I bet money that he's already given it to other people.
[00:36:44.514 --> 00:36:48.316]  You know, you said that last night in the special report, the endowment will probably spread it.
[00:36:48.316 --> 00:36:50.237]  Now they're going to spread it to other people.
[00:36:50.237 --> 00:36:52.518]  And now, thanks a lot, federal government.
[00:36:52.518 --> 00:36:55.819]  Thanks a lot for doing what you do so great.
[00:36:55.819 --> 00:36:57.620]  You know, you're not like Kiefer Several and 24.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:03.042]  You're a bunch of folks that burn down the business and collect the insurance money.
[00:37:03.042 --> 00:37:13.027]  And I'll guarantee you, a lot of people who have gone along with this system are going to have their families affected by this one way or another, economically or physically, by the crisis this is going to create.
[00:37:13.387 --> 00:37:14.708]  There's still a chance of maybe.
[00:37:30.879 --> 00:37:33.382]  Anywhere you are in the world, come here, we'll pay for everything.
[00:37:33.382 --> 00:37:34.924]  Why not announce?
[00:37:34.924 --> 00:37:35.866]  It's politically correct.
[00:37:35.866 --> 00:37:40.632]  If you have Ebola, come here, we'll put you in a school next to some American kids.
[00:37:40.632 --> 00:37:47.141]  I mean, that's how over the top 2 plus 2 equals 5 is, and you didn't build your business, and Obamacare is free.
[00:37:48.078 --> 00:37:50.101]  And all this other bull is.
[00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.523]  And no other nation would act like this or behave like this.
[00:37:52.523 --> 00:37:56.608]  We knew the fix was in when they started shipping Ebola patients into the U.S.
[00:37:56.608 --> 00:38:01.314]  We knew the fix was in when they shut down the flights or didn't even try to screen people.
[00:38:01.314 --> 00:38:06.020]  We knew the fix was in and now the hospitals won't even ask somebody who's sick
[00:38:07.161 --> 00:38:09.564]  Coming in from West Africa, from Nigeria.
[00:38:09.564 --> 00:38:11.726]  Hey, were you around people with Ebola?
[00:38:11.726 --> 00:38:13.509]  This is ridiculous.
[00:38:13.509 --> 00:38:15.231]  This is what America is.
[00:38:15.231 --> 00:38:16.652]  Trained to lay down.
[00:38:16.652 --> 00:38:18.374]  Trained to have no instincts.
[00:38:18.374 --> 00:38:20.837]  And by the way, it's not fear-mongering to warn people.
[00:38:20.837 --> 00:38:22.840]  If you see smoke coming out of your neighbor's roof...
[00:38:24.153 --> 00:38:27.535]  Have you seen smoke coming out of your neighbor's roof and you don't see them awake?
[00:38:27.535 --> 00:38:28.736]  You go and you bang on the door.
[00:38:28.736 --> 00:38:31.677]  Bob, you know, Carol, or whatever their names are, get out of here!
[00:38:31.677 --> 00:38:32.938]  Your house is on fire!
[00:38:32.938 --> 00:38:34.079]  You call the fire department.
[00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:35.259]  That's taking action.
[00:38:35.259 --> 00:38:39.982]  Well, our government saw a 50-foot flame shooting out, and they ordered gasoline thrown on it.
[00:38:40.562 --> 00:38:53.688]  And then now they're going to show up once it's burned down and do a press conference on the ashes with a bullhorn talking about how America came together and Homeland Security and Obamacare, you know, helped with the hundreds of thousands of Americans that got Ebola.
[00:38:53.688 --> 00:38:55.729]  These are the type of scenarios we're facing.
[00:38:56.329 --> 00:39:03.500]  Because the globalists are launching global destabilization plans, and believe me, they're not going to stop here.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:10.771]  If they're crazy enough to think they can get away with bringing in Ebola patients and letting people fly in from Africa, poor countries are collapsing.
[00:39:11.372 --> 00:39:13.514]  Well, everybody else is controlling this.
[00:39:13.514 --> 00:39:16.536]  If they're going to do that here, they're going to do everything else.
[00:39:16.536 --> 00:39:18.978]  Katie Barbador.
[00:39:18.978 --> 00:39:20.720]  Katie Barbador.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.183]  They are just... He's going to sign executive orders to take the guns.
[00:39:24.183 --> 00:39:26.605]  He's going to sign executive orders to end the borders completely.
[00:39:26.605 --> 00:39:29.107]  They're going to sign executive orders to shut down all the power plants.
[00:39:29.107 --> 00:39:32.429]  They're going to do... And if you don't like it, an armored vehicle is coming to your house.
[00:39:32.429 --> 00:39:33.370]  Well, okay, fine.
[00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.032]  Those cops are going to have their kids die from Ebola, too.
[00:39:36.032 --> 00:39:37.013]  So, everybody, go ahead.
[00:39:37.013 --> 00:39:37.954]  It's a suicide pact.
[00:39:40.305 --> 00:39:43.567]  Run by a bunch of banks that have robbed us blind and hate our guts.
[00:39:43.567 --> 00:39:52.912]  Let's just submit to them and do whatever they say and let them set up random checkpoints on the highway and have the government listen to our phones and the Tea Party and harass pro-wipers.
[00:39:52.912 --> 00:39:57.155]  But we can't check people coming in from Ebola countries.
[00:39:57.555 --> 00:39:59.836]  This is how ridiculous it all is.
[00:39:59.836 --> 00:40:03.718]  Paul, I'm turning it over to you and Joe Biggs from Dallas and Josh Owens in Dallas.
[00:40:03.718 --> 00:40:06.179]  They're courageous to go up there and be near the hospital.
[00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:09.861]  We got Rick Perry's press conference coming up with our questions and more.
[00:40:09.861 --> 00:40:12.943]  And if you're listening to this transmission, folks, you're not a bystander.
[00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:13.903]  You're in the arena.
[00:40:13.903 --> 00:40:14.744]  Get on the phone.
[00:40:14.744 --> 00:40:15.544]  Call the White House.
[00:40:15.544 --> 00:40:16.445]  Call Congress.
[00:40:16.445 --> 00:40:17.005]  Call the media.
[00:40:17.025 --> 00:40:17.526]  We're good.
[00:40:35.444 --> 00:40:36.844]  We're good to go.
[00:40:51.369 --> 00:40:54.410]  And I don't mean to use those type of words lightly, but that's what it is.
[00:40:54.410 --> 00:41:00.693]  Get up off of your butts, stop being morons, and get involved, and realize we aren't alarmists.
[00:41:00.693 --> 00:41:01.734]  We're realists here.
[00:41:01.734 --> 00:41:03.274]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:41:03.274 --> 00:41:04.775]  We immerse ourselves in this.
[00:41:04.775 --> 00:41:05.956]  We're committed to freedom.
[00:41:05.956 --> 00:41:07.316]  We're committed to America.
[00:41:07.316 --> 00:41:08.517]  We're committed to the Republic.
[00:41:09.077 --> 00:41:10.438]  We're real, folks.
[00:41:10.438 --> 00:41:20.067]  And the reason we see so alien, the reason we see so weird to a bunch of domesticated serfs is because we've turned into jellyfish blades.
[00:41:20.067 --> 00:41:26.273]  And so when people act like real Americans, or people act like real Westerners, or people that have basic survival instincts,
[00:41:26.753 --> 00:41:28.434]  We're called a bunch of scum.
[00:41:28.434 --> 00:41:29.614]  No, we're not.
[00:41:29.614 --> 00:41:34.976]  We tried to stop this and now it may get out of hand and I'm sure we'll get the blame for it in the end.
[00:41:34.976 --> 00:41:36.356]  Paul Watson, God bless you.
[00:41:36.356 --> 00:41:37.577]  It's up to you listeners.
[00:41:37.577 --> 00:41:46.540]  It's up to you to get the horror media up off their butts and to ask real questions to put heat on these politicians so they can't basically
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:51.242]  They have a joint suicide pact with everybody to bring Ebola into this country.
[00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:56.565]  And even if this doesn't get out of hand, and I hope it doesn't, what does it say about these people's mindsets?
[00:41:56.565 --> 00:41:59.326]  What does it say about how they operate?
[00:41:59.326 --> 00:42:05.989]  That they would try to do this, obviously try to get Ebola going in the country, so Obama could act like a savior.
[00:42:05.989 --> 00:42:08.530]  He is Barack Ebola from now on.
[00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.191]  President Obama is Barack Ebola.
[00:42:11.191 --> 00:42:11.972]  God bless you all.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.120]  There goes Alex Jones.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:21.964]  And remember, it was President Obama who said that Ebola, it would be, quote, unlikely for Ebola to arrive in the United States.
[00:42:21.964 --> 00:42:26.147]  And of course, we were called conspiracy theorists and fear mongers for weeks on end.
[00:42:26.147 --> 00:42:37.953]  In fact, CBS News wrote an article attacking InfoWars, attacking me directly after I appeared on the Michael Savage Show, simply to go through some of the evidence that Ebola could have mutated, it could have gone airborne.
[00:42:37.953 --> 00:42:40.114]  And we were attacked, we were demonized.
[00:42:40.114 --> 00:42:40.314]  Now,
[00:42:40.874 --> 00:42:43.898]  The media is basically trying to downplay this.
[00:42:43.898 --> 00:42:47.642]  The CDC is trying to downplay it for obvious reasons to prevent hysteria.
[00:42:47.642 --> 00:42:51.487]  But I think there's also another reason why they're trying to downplay it.
[00:42:51.487 --> 00:42:53.730]  And that's because they've dropped the ball completely.
[00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.672]  They've been caught with their pants down.
[00:42:55.672 --> 00:43:00.218]  The health authorities there in Dallas, this individual came into the hospital
[00:43:00.698 --> 00:43:09.180]  With Ebola symptoms they gave him antibiotics and sent him on his way without asking any questions whatsoever about his travel history.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:14.262]  He had come from Liberia, which of course has been ravaged by Ebola.
[00:43:14.262 --> 00:43:18.723]  In fact, Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
[00:43:19.443 --> 00:43:37.259]  He told CNN this morning, I was watching this in the hotel room, that it was, quote, an enormous red flag that they didn't ask this individual about his travel history, given that he's obviously, you know, he's a black gentleman, he's come from Liberia, he's obviously got a foreign accent, he's got Ebola symptoms.
[00:43:37.259 --> 00:43:44.405]  They gave him antibiotics and sent him home and for a total of four days he was wandering around Dallas and God knows where else.
[00:43:45.406 --> 00:43:47.527]  Infecting other people, potentially.
[00:43:47.527 --> 00:43:49.487]  They're now talking about a second Ebola case.
[00:43:49.487 --> 00:43:55.849]  The Health and Human Services official has indicated that a second case is probable.
[00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:59.051]  And here we have the article from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:59.051 --> 00:44:06.353]  Texas Ebola patient was sent home for two days with antibiotics.
[00:44:06.353 --> 00:44:08.233]  So he went to the hospital.
[00:44:08.233 --> 00:44:09.674]  They gave him the antibiotics.
[00:44:09.674 --> 00:44:10.874]  They sent him home.
[00:44:10.874 --> 00:44:12.335]  No questions asked.
[00:44:13.075 --> 00:44:23.039]  The Associated Press reports that the man who travelled from Liberia to Dallas on September 20th was dismissed from a Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on the 26th after seeking care.
[00:44:23.039 --> 00:44:29.202]  He was evaluated and given a prescription for antibiotics, with hospital workers believing he had some other ailment.
[00:44:29.202 --> 00:44:42.267]  So, again, they completely dropped the ball on it, yet we've been called fear mongers and conspiracy theorists for the best part of two months for simply warning about this situation arriving in the US, which it now indeed
[00:44:42.887 --> 00:44:59.134]  Has, and of course Obama said it was unlikely and even Chris Matthews last night on MSNBC got in an argument with Ezekiel Emmanuel about the fact that Obama basically broke yet another promise almost that Ebola would not arrive in the US.
[00:44:59.134 --> 00:45:01.576]  Obviously the precautions were not taken.
[00:45:01.576 --> 00:45:10.860]  There's another article I believe out of the Washington Times with the CDC admitting now that they were not prepared for this despite the fact for telling us for two months that they were prepared
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.661]  That this was very unlikely.
[00:45:13.661 --> 00:45:28.428]  Let's go to that Chris Matthews clip now from MSNBC, where even Matthews, who of course said he got a thrill up his leg for the Obama speech back a couple of years ago, is now on the offensive against Obama over this Ebola situation.
[00:45:28.428 --> 00:45:29.488]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:45:29.488 --> 00:45:36.071]  Yeah, but I'm just getting back to the President's statement, Doctor, and that is that the President said it would be unlikely if he had a case in this country.
[00:45:36.071 --> 00:45:37.392]  Unlikely to have even one case.
[00:45:38.132 --> 00:45:40.876]  See the tape again?
[00:45:40.876 --> 00:45:48.486]  He said it wouldn't be an Ebola outbreak, and I think that's the accurate... No, and in the second part of his sentence, he said that in the unlikely case, someone brings it here.
[00:45:48.486 --> 00:45:50.268]  In the unlikely case, someone brings it here.
[00:45:50.268 --> 00:45:51.069]  Well, they've done it.
[00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:53.072]  We're living in the world of the unlikely already.
[00:45:53.072 --> 00:45:53.853]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:45:54.193 --> 00:45:58.277]  I'm not spearmongering, I'm stating the facts, and I wonder if everybody else is.
[00:45:58.277 --> 00:46:03.583]  You're right, it is an unlikely case, but it's not, again, we need to put it in perspective.
[00:46:03.583 --> 00:46:10.470]  This isn't easily transmitted, it's not like the flu, it's not like measles or chicken pox.
[00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:15.315]  You need bodily, you need contact with bodily fluids, and we have a health system.
[00:46:16.396 --> 00:46:20.463]  I remember we also had today Sanjay Gupta on CNN.
[00:46:20.463 --> 00:46:21.565]  We're trying to find this clip.
[00:46:21.565 --> 00:46:22.967]  I saw it on an article earlier.
[00:46:22.967 --> 00:46:24.149]  They since changed the article.
[00:46:25.578 --> 00:46:26.518]  And we've got that clip now.
[00:46:26.518 --> 00:46:36.744]  This is Sanjay Gupta saying, explaining the fact that although this is not airborne as far as we know, it's quite easy to pass on to other individuals merely by shaking their hand.
[00:46:36.744 --> 00:46:47.329]  We think of, you know, exchange of bodily fluids as something more than that, but sweat glands can achieve that, especially if you've got, you know, a broken area of your skin in your hand.
[00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:51.651]  And here's Dr. Sanjay Gupta on CNN this morning explaining how that works.
[00:46:52.071 --> 00:46:59.198]  To your point, Wolf, from the 24th to the 28th, it sounds like this is somebody who was sick but was not in isolation.
[00:46:59.198 --> 00:47:09.589]  What is going to be absolutely critical, obviously besides taking care of this individual, is now to go back over those four days and figure out anybody that person may have had contact with.
[00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:11.531]  That's absolutely critical.
[00:47:11.531 --> 00:47:14.254]  It is absolutely crucial to do that to try and prevent
[00:47:14.694 --> 00:47:17.577]  Other people from possibly spreading this virus.
[00:47:17.577 --> 00:47:24.483]  It is called contact tracing, and as Dr. Frieden pointed out, it is a mainstay of controlling these sorts of things.
[00:47:24.483 --> 00:47:31.310]  But obviously, four days is a significant period of time, and there could be many contacts the person may have had.
[00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.393]  Once they find those contacts, they gotta monitor those people.
[00:47:34.793 --> 00:47:42.979]  For three weeks, 21 days, and make sure they don't develop any signs of fever, because that could be one of the earliest signs of an Ebola infection.
[00:47:42.979 --> 00:48:01.211]  So, a couple of priorities, Wolf, as Dr. Frieden laid out, I think as you said, transparently, first and foremost, you have the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, the care for that person, obviously of paramount importance, but then going back, finding all those contacts, and really monitoring them closely.
[00:48:01.651 --> 00:48:08.137]  Putting them in a situation where they can't possibly spread Ebola and monitor to see if they develop any fevers.
[00:48:08.137 --> 00:48:12.101]  So that's what's happening right now here in the United States.
[00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:13.282]  This has not happened before.
[00:48:13.282 --> 00:48:17.365]  It's happening a lot in West Africa, as Dr. Frieden pointed out.
[00:48:17.365 --> 00:48:22.590]  But from a medical standpoint, this is historic, what Dr. Frieden has just outlined.
[00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:24.010]  That's very worrisome.
[00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:31.053]  That's Dr. Sanjay Gupta on CNN, I believe, either last night or this morning, talking about how easy this could spread.
[00:48:31.053 --> 00:48:37.475]  Obviously, we know it's not airborne, but the key fact, I think, is the threat, which is the threat of hysteria.
[00:48:37.475 --> 00:48:41.257]  It's not necessarily the threat of a pandemic or an epidemic of Ebola.
[00:48:41.257 --> 00:48:51.121]  It's the threat of hysteria, which could grease the skids for this medical martial law situation that many people have been concerned about since, for example, 2001 with the model states
[00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:54.283]  Emergency Health Powers Act.
[00:48:54.283 --> 00:49:02.151]  We've got Joe Biggs, I think we'll go to him after the break now because we're coming up on a break in a couple of minutes, but we got Joe Biggs live on the scene.
[00:49:02.151 --> 00:49:04.934]  On, in Dallas, we're gonna go to him now just before the break.
[00:49:04.934 --> 00:49:06.636]  Joe Biggs, you're there in Dallas.
[00:49:06.636 --> 00:49:07.236]  What's going on?
[00:49:07.236 --> 00:49:08.137]  What's the situation?
[00:49:08.137 --> 00:49:14.704]  I don't hear anything.
[00:49:14.704 --> 00:49:15.445]  Joe, can you hear me?
[00:49:16.772 --> 00:49:17.673]  Oh, I can hear you now.
[00:49:17.673 --> 00:49:19.473]  Hey, Joe, you're on the scene in Dallas.
[00:49:19.473 --> 00:49:21.094]  Tell us what's unfolding.
[00:49:21.094 --> 00:49:23.456]  What's the situation there?
[00:49:23.456 --> 00:49:28.678]  Roger, I'm here at Ground Zero at Ebola USA, where patient zero is.
[00:49:28.678 --> 00:49:30.720]  You know, there's a lot of things unfolding right now.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.721]  You know, we have that confirmed patient with Ebola.
[00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:40.525]  Right now, they have another individual that's hospitalized or monitoring that have the symptoms of Ebola.
[00:49:40.525 --> 00:49:43.106]  So they're going to keep an eye on that person.
[00:49:43.106 --> 00:49:46.228]  One of the things that was crazy, though, I heard you mention it earlier on the show,
[00:49:46.943 --> 00:49:53.144]  You know, Thursday, the patient tried to check himself in, and they turned him away with flu-like symptoms and gave him antibiotics.
[00:49:53.144 --> 00:50:00.126]  So that's quite a long time, a long period of time, where he's been able to have contact with many individuals.
[00:50:00.126 --> 00:50:05.187]  You know, there was an Ebola expert on last night at one of the local stations.
[00:50:05.187 --> 00:50:08.688]  I stayed up till 2 in the morning watching local news to see what they had to say.
[00:50:08.688 --> 00:50:13.889]  And the Ebola expert said that he fears that there will be, you know, quite a few more.
[00:50:13.889 --> 00:50:15.449]  One of the last people in Africa that
[00:50:15.956 --> 00:50:17.398]  Got a bullet was one man.
[00:50:17.398 --> 00:50:19.500]  He infected 19 people.
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:26.347]  So it's a very, very scary thing and it's a very big possibility that this person has infected many other people.
[00:50:27.714 --> 00:50:32.455]  And Rick Perry's coming up there in about 15 minutes, I think, with a news conference.
[00:50:32.455 --> 00:50:33.875]  Alex was on the show earlier.
[00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:40.637]  We're calling on Perry to ask the White House to shut down flights from West Africa into the United States.
[00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:43.377]  Biggs, if you could ask Perry a question, that would be great.
[00:50:43.377 --> 00:50:44.918]  We'll be back with more Ebola news.
[00:50:44.918 --> 00:50:46.398]  Joe Biggs, live on the scene.
[00:50:46.398 --> 00:50:47.338]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:50:47.338 --> 00:50:49.879]  This is InfoWars.com.
[00:50:49.879 --> 00:50:50.459]  Stay tuned.
[00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:02.857]  You heard the discussions all over the radio.
[00:51:02.857 --> 00:51:05.357]  You couldn't believe what you were hearing.
[00:51:05.357 --> 00:51:06.817]  You trusted them.
[00:51:06.817 --> 00:51:08.478]  You felt betrayed.
[00:51:08.478 --> 00:51:11.118]  Your emotions began to consume you.
[00:51:11.118 --> 00:51:12.498]  Outrage set in.
[00:51:12.498 --> 00:51:14.198]  Then, nothing.
[00:51:14.198 --> 00:51:16.419]  Days turned to weeks and months.
[00:51:16.419 --> 00:51:19.319]  Then... But they haven't.
[00:51:19.319 --> 00:51:22.640]  They're still monitoring your every move.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.420]  It's coming.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.340]  What's coming?
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.981]  Monitor BlocketPocket.com.
[00:51:26.981 --> 00:51:28.621]  Or will you forget?
[00:51:29.901 --> 00:51:30.901]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:51:30.901 --> 00:51:34.342]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:51:34.342 --> 00:51:36.023]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[00:51:36.023 --> 00:51:37.963]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:51:37.963 --> 00:51:43.805]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:51:43.805 --> 00:51:44.645]  I know, right?
[00:51:44.645 --> 00:51:45.946]  You love it, too!
[00:51:45.946 --> 00:51:47.406]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:51:47.406 --> 00:51:48.406]  Let's go get some!
[00:51:48.406 --> 00:51:50.127]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.

[00:51:58.829 --> 00:52:01.671]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:01.671 --> 00:52:06.773]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.773 --> 00:52:14.898]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:19.420]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:23.242]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:23.402 --> 00:52:29.347]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:29.347 --> 00:52:32.509]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:32.509 --> 00:52:37.874]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:37.874 --> 00:52:45.900]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:54:17.081 --> 00:54:21.002]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show, this live edition, Wednesday, October 1st.
[00:54:21.002 --> 00:54:24.324]  We've got David Knight in studio for the second and third hours.
[00:54:24.324 --> 00:54:35.270]  We've also got Gerald Solente coming up in the third hour to talk the latest financial news, the attack on Syria, the offensive against ISIS, Bitcoin and more.
[00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:38.011]  We'll also be taking your calls at the bottom of the next
[00:54:38.211 --> 00:54:40.213]  hour on Ebola, mainly.
[00:54:40.213 --> 00:54:43.797]  The calling number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:43.797 --> 00:54:53.087]  But for the moment we've got Joe Biggs live on the scene at the Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas, covering the latest Ebola situation.
[00:54:53.087 --> 00:54:59.194]  One confirmed case, likelihood that a second patient has been infected, a family member of the victim.
[00:54:59.694 --> 00:55:09.156]  And we put the call out earlier for people to contact the White House to urge them to cease flights into the United States of America from these West African countries.
[00:55:09.156 --> 00:55:11.537]  Britain, France have already done that.
[00:55:11.537 --> 00:55:13.377]  The United States failed to do so.
[00:55:13.377 --> 00:55:17.038]  Now we have the first case arriving from Liberia.
[00:55:17.038 --> 00:55:20.259]  We got Rick Perry coming up with a press conference here in about 10 minutes.
[00:55:20.259 --> 00:55:23.940]  We're going to try and catch some of that and hopefully Biggs can get a question in there.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.622]  Joe Biggs, other points on this case.
[00:55:26.622 --> 00:55:30.485]  You said you were up until 2am watching the breaking news coverage on this.
[00:55:30.485 --> 00:55:34.427]  Other facets of this Ebola situation?
[00:55:34.427 --> 00:55:42.313]  Yeah, you know, I flipped back and forth between, you know, your hardcore mainstream, you know, your Fox News, your CNN, your MSNBC.
[00:55:42.313 --> 00:55:53.081]  In between that and what the local media is saying, the people in Dallas are, they've been put on a high alert, you know, to be very, very careful while they're out of anyone with any symptoms.
[00:55:53.081 --> 00:55:53.782]  People are
[00:55:54.913 --> 00:55:55.413]  All right.
[00:56:16.638 --> 00:56:20.325]  You know, there's a lot of people that could be affected by this one man.
[00:56:20.325 --> 00:56:21.547]  And like you said, that's a great point.
[00:56:21.547 --> 00:56:25.955]  Why haven't we shut down those flights coming from West Africa into our country?
[00:56:25.955 --> 00:56:27.638]  That's something that needs to be stopped immediately.
[00:56:29.412 --> 00:56:37.116]  Also, I mean, this morning we mentioned earlier the clip of Zachariah Thompson, the director of Dallas County Health and Human Services.
[00:56:37.116 --> 00:56:46.542]  He mentioned, as far as I can recall, the possibility that they're keeping children home from school in the Dallas area or in the immediate area surrounding that hospital.
[00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:51.824]  I'd like to get some confirmation on that, if the writers could help me out, because I remember he mentioned that.
[00:56:51.824 --> 00:56:57.728]  So, as you said, Joe, it seems that the media and the authorities in the local area of Dallas
[00:56:58.428 --> 00:57:08.275]  I'm quite concerned about this, whereas generally in terms of nationwide media we get this message about, you know, this is nothing, we've got this isolated, it's nothing to worry about.
[00:57:08.275 --> 00:57:12.498]  Obviously that's what you would expect them to do to prevent hysteria, but as I said earlier,
[00:57:13.659 --> 00:57:18.542]  They got caught with their pants down, because as you mentioned, Joe, this guy was walking around for four days.
[00:57:18.542 --> 00:57:22.304]  He came in two days before the case was confirmed.
[00:57:22.304 --> 00:57:25.025]  They gave him antibiotics and sent him home.
[00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:30.168]  So, Joe, I mean, we've been called conspiracy theorists for the best part of two months for warning about this.
[00:57:30.828 --> 00:57:45.171]  Now it happens, and it seems like it's an attempt on behalf of the CDC and the medical authorities to cover their behinds, because they could and should have asked this guy about his travel history and caught this at least a couple of days earlier.
[00:57:45.171 --> 00:57:56.074]  Yeah, I mean, that's standard operating procedure for any kind of hospital, especially when, you know, talks of Ebola have been going on for, you know, a couple months now.
[00:57:56.074 --> 00:57:58.014]  You know, that's something when someone shows up, that's
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:57:58.920]  Yeah.
[00:58:11.747 --> 00:58:12.787]  Okay, Joe Biggs live on the scene.
[00:58:12.787 --> 00:58:13.528]  David Knight coming up.
[00:58:13.528 --> 00:58:13.808]  Stay tuned.
[00:58:40.145 --> 00:58:43.409]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.665 --> 00:58:55.807]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:58:55.807 --> 00:58:59.109]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:58:59.109 --> 00:59:00.889]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!

[00:59:07.232 --> 00:59:13.154]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:59:13.294 --> 00:59:17.237]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[00:59:20.319 --> 00:59:28.605]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:59:28.605 --> 00:59:30.687]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:59:30.687 --> 00:59:31.748]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:59:32.108 --> 00:59:41.054]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:00:13.559 --> 01:00:17.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.842]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.796 --> 01:00:32.596]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:34.817]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex today.
[01:00:34.817 --> 01:00:41.019]  Obviously we've got huge breaking news on the first case of Ebola confirmed in the United States.
[01:00:41.019 --> 01:00:45.840]  We've got our reporter Joe Biggs live on the scene with Josh Owens there in Dallas.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:50.381]  We're waiting for Rick Perry to give a press conference which is coming up in the next five to ten minutes.
[01:00:50.381 --> 01:00:52.482]  So we're going to try to get some audio feed from that.
[01:00:52.862 --> 01:00:57.626]  I'm going to take your calls at the bottom of the hour on 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:57.626 --> 01:01:01.089]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:01.089 --> 01:01:05.973]  Obviously on Ebola, then we got Gerald Solente coming up in the third hour.
[01:01:05.973 --> 01:01:13.879]  We'll ask him about the Ebola situation and much more, including Syria, ISIS, Bitcoin and the latest financial situation.
[01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:17.122]  But now I'm joined in studio by David Knight.
[01:01:17.122 --> 01:01:21.246]  David, your comments on this unfolding Ebola situation.
[01:01:22.142 --> 01:01:29.789]  Well, I guess, Paul, the first thing I was thinking was, with you being here from the UK, I started thinking about how they quarantine dogs in the UK.
[01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:39.857]  You know, since from 1897 until 2012, they would quarantine any dog that was coming into the country for six months, as you probably know.
[01:01:39.857 --> 01:01:41.839]  Now, they changed that policy in 2012.
[01:01:41.839 --> 01:01:44.381]  What they did was they changed it to
[01:01:45.921 --> 01:01:48.803]  21 days if they were a non-EU country.
[01:01:48.803 --> 01:01:53.287]  They would change it to, sorry, if it was the EU or the US, it would be 21 days.
[01:01:53.287 --> 01:01:58.210]  It would be three months if it was outside of the EU or the US.
[01:01:58.210 --> 01:01:59.811]  But still, they're quarantining dogs.
[01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:05.015]  Why can't we get them to treat us at least with as much respect as they have for dogs?
[01:02:05.015 --> 01:02:07.637]  I mean, we can't even get the kind of treatment that you would expect for dogs.
[01:02:07.637 --> 01:02:09.078]  As Alex was saying when he was talking to you,
[01:02:09.818 --> 01:02:15.881]  Why not tell these people, if you're going to come in from a country where there's a pandemic going, we're going to isolate you.
[01:02:15.881 --> 01:02:17.882]  You'll have to pay for this isolation.
[01:02:17.882 --> 01:02:21.184]  You're going to be set aside for 21 days while we monitor you.
[01:02:21.184 --> 01:02:24.285]  They are checking people for fever when they put them on the planes.
[01:02:24.285 --> 01:02:27.767]  But of course, this flight is anywhere from 22 to 33 hours.
[01:02:27.767 --> 01:02:33.070]  Anywhere from two to three stopovers to go from Liberia to the United States.
[01:02:34.747 --> 01:02:37.150]  You know, something can happen within that period of time.
[01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:39.112]  And of course, they're not following those patients.
[01:02:39.112 --> 01:02:54.211]  Once they come in and check them for fever, and they make it onto the plane, there's no more tracking of those patients, and there's no testing of them once they arrive at any of these stopover destinations, whether it's in Europe or Asia or wherever, you know, when they're coming to the United States, depending on which direction they go.
[01:02:55.287 --> 01:03:11.658]  And that's interesting David, because I remember back in 2009 during the swine flu outbreak, when we arrived, I was flying into China, into Shanghai from Britain, and they did the testing when we arrived, so we couldn't even get off the flight before we could enter the airport.
[01:03:11.658 --> 01:03:17.642]  They came on in full hazmat suits and were giving the temperature test for every individual passenger.
[01:03:17.642 --> 01:03:17.963]  It seems
[01:03:18.723 --> 01:03:21.725]  The situation now with this Ebola case is very lax.
[01:03:21.725 --> 01:03:33.453]  As I said earlier, Air France, British Airways and Emirates, which are three huge airlines, banned all flights from West Africa as of the end of August.
[01:03:33.453 --> 01:03:43.601]  America basically stood back and did nothing, despite Obama at one point saying this was a global security threat, even though he said it was unlikely that Ebola would arrive in the United States.
[01:03:44.301 --> 01:03:46.424]  They don't seem to have prepared any measures.
[01:03:46.424 --> 01:03:52.413]  Now we've got articles out of the Washington Times where the CDC said they were underfunded, they weren't prepared for this.
[01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:57.119]  Yet all along they told us not to worry, that they would deal with it if it happened.
[01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:59.963]  Yeah, and clearly, as that story broke the other day,
[01:04:00.981 --> 01:04:09.289]  I think you were the one that broke it about the CDC putting the information out there that how to handle dead bodies that had people who had died from Ebola.
[01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:19.580]  They put that information out there after they knew about this patient because this is something that depending on whose chronology you look at, they first learned about it on either the 24th or on the 26th.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.962]  The press conference was yesterday the 30th.
[01:04:23.523 --> 01:04:28.629]  And in the interim, they put together this thing about dead bodies and sent this out everywhere.
[01:04:28.629 --> 01:04:31.212]  I'm not as optimistic as the CDC is.
[01:04:31.212 --> 01:04:34.535]  When I look at this, I see staggering incompetence at the very least.
[01:04:34.535 --> 01:04:42.584]  I mean, anybody who doesn't think that this was a deliberate propagation of a pandemic has to look at this at the incompetence and just be absolutely amazed.
[01:04:43.663 --> 01:04:48.728]  We'll be back shortly with more from Joe Biggs and David Knight on the unfolding Ebola situation.
[01:04:48.728 --> 01:04:51.471]  I'm Paul Joseph Fox and this is the Alex Jones Show.

[01:05:18.358 --> 01:05:19.378]  DNA Force.
[01:05:19.378 --> 01:05:21.398]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:05:29.747 --> 01:05:33.388]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:37.670]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:39.450]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:47.313]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:47.313 --> 01:05:48.454]  But for how long?
[01:05:48.454 --> 01:05:55.096]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:55.096 --> 01:05:57.917]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:00.532 --> 01:06:01.893]  In the near future.
[01:06:01.893 --> 01:06:05.536]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:05.536 --> 01:06:06.377]  Security alert.
[01:06:06.377 --> 01:06:07.598]  Security alert.
[01:06:07.598 --> 01:06:09.599]  This is Homeland Security.

[01:06:18.186 --> 01:06:19.227]  Prime Directive.
[01:06:19.227 --> 01:06:20.768]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:23.611]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:23.611 --> 01:06:26.873]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:26.873 --> 01:06:29.035]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:29.155 --> 01:06:30.676]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:30.676 --> 01:06:32.857]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:32.857 --> 01:06:35.459]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:39.481]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:09.011]  Man-centered, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.011 --> 01:08:11.992]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.188 --> 01:08:25.169]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:25.169 --> 01:08:26.170]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:28.651]  Filling in for Alex riding shotgun is David Knight.
[01:08:28.651 --> 01:08:32.533]  Obviously we're talking about the latest Ebola outbreak news.
[01:08:32.533 --> 01:08:37.675]  We've got Rick Perry, Governor Rick Perry, coming up with a press conference very shortly.
[01:08:37.675 --> 01:08:48.401]  We're asking him and we're asking our listeners to contact the White House and urge them to block all incoming flights from West Africa, at least for a period of time, because that's what several other top
[01:08:48.721 --> 01:08:53.123]  Airlines have done over the past few weeks and yet the United States failed to do so.
[01:08:53.123 --> 01:08:56.365]  Now we have Ebola arriving from Liberia.
[01:08:56.365 --> 01:09:00.848]  CNBC reports Dow dives 200 points as global worries hit stocks.
[01:09:00.848 --> 01:09:05.210]  One of those worries is identified as this Ebola outbreak.
[01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:08.932]  So, you know, we've got CDC saying this is nothing whatsoever to worry about.
[01:09:08.932 --> 01:09:10.553]  It's an isolated case yet.
[01:09:10.553 --> 01:09:11.513]  It's already wiped 200 points.
[01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:16.476]  Off stocks, off the Dow Jones as of this morning.
[01:09:16.476 --> 01:09:19.278]  Also on Infowars.com, we've got a big story.
[01:09:19.278 --> 01:09:24.702]  Former FDA top scientist says more will be infected now that Ebola is in Texas.
[01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:32.268]  And this is Dr. Jesse L. Goodman, formally, actually, currently, formally with the Food and Drug Administration.
[01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:36.291]  He said the public should not panic, although he said the government should prepare for the worse.
[01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:41.895]  It's quite appropriate to be concerned on many fronts, Goodman said, according to the Washington Examiner.
[01:09:42.575 --> 01:09:47.597]  I think we're ready to go to this press conference with Rick Perry, is that correct?
[01:09:47.597 --> 01:09:49.037]  Let's go ahead.
[01:09:49.037 --> 01:09:58.240]  And Superintendent Miles and our local, our state and our federal partners in keeping this contained.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:07.083]  This is a disease that is not airborne and is substantially more difficult to contract than the common cold.
[01:10:08.925 --> 01:10:17.731]  We have experts here with us today who will be talking to you in a minute about cautions that you may want to take.
[01:10:17.731 --> 01:10:35.884]  The medical community of North Texas along with officials from the state and federal government have been working together to take every step available and necessary to care for this patient's health and to ensure the safety and welfare of our citizens.
[01:10:37.509 --> 01:10:47.352]  There are few places in the world better equipped to meet the challenge that is posed in this case.
[01:10:47.352 --> 01:10:55.754]  Texas is one of only 13 states certified by the CDC to conduct diagnostic Ebola testing.
[01:10:55.754 --> 01:11:01.916]  And we have the health care professionals and the institutions that are second to none
[01:11:03.456 --> 01:11:13.238]  The public should have every confidence that the highly trained professionals involved here will succeed in this very important mission.
[01:11:13.238 --> 01:11:29.062]  Public health investigators from Dallas County and from the Texas Department of State Health Services are working to identify, to locate, and monitor the health of all of those who have come into close contact with the patient.
[01:11:29.062 --> 01:11:31.643]  The highly qualified men and women of
[01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:40.946]  Texas Health Presbyterian are doing everything in their power to deliver the very best care for this patient.
[01:11:40.946 --> 01:11:50.610]  They have been and they will continue to be in close contact with federal, state, and local officials to ensure the public's safety.
[01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:52.370]  This case is serious.
[01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:57.152]  Rest assured that our system is working as it should.
[01:11:57.152 --> 01:12:01.654]  Professionals on every level of the chain of command know what to do.
[01:12:02.421 --> 01:12:08.684]  To minimize this potential risk to the people of Texas, and of this country for that matter.
[01:12:08.684 --> 01:12:19.589]  I'd like to ask Dr. David Lakey, he is the head of our state health services, to come and share with you the efforts that are ongoing as we address this issue.
[01:12:19.589 --> 01:12:19.829]  David?
[01:12:26.445 --> 01:12:27.307]  Good morning, everyone.
[01:12:27.307 --> 01:12:28.589]  My name is David Lakey.
[01:12:28.589 --> 01:12:33.216]  I'm the Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, and I really appreciate you being here today.
[01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:37.503]  I want to echo several of the comments that were made by the Governor.
[01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:43.399]  First, our thoughts and prayers are really with the family.
[01:12:43.399 --> 01:12:48.101]  They were notified about their loved one having Ebola yesterday.
[01:12:48.101 --> 01:12:52.723]  Obviously, it was a scary diagnosis, and so our thoughts and prayers are with them right now.
[01:12:52.723 --> 01:13:00.507]  And also with the treatment team, those individuals in the healthcare that are caring for the individual right now.
[01:13:00.507 --> 01:13:07.630]  Since the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, Texas has been taking steps to make sure that we are prepared for an event like this.
[01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:10.785]  A lot of education has taken place.
[01:13:10.785 --> 01:13:14.768]  A lot of protocols have been put in place.
[01:13:14.768 --> 01:13:23.035]  We've developed the ability to test for this virus since August, and to be able to do that in our laboratory.
[01:13:23.035 --> 01:13:26.017]  And that preparedness is not just taking place at this level.
[01:13:26.758 --> 01:13:27.359]  They sent him home?
[01:13:27.359 --> 01:13:28.479]  He'll be diagnosed in a few days.
[01:13:43.951 --> 01:13:46.533]  So we've been on the lookout for this.
[01:13:46.533 --> 01:13:58.341]  I had the opportunity today to spend time with the team and talk to the management team and hear how they have been preparing for a long time for this event.
[01:13:58.341 --> 01:14:08.248]  And then I had the opportunity to talk to the infection control practitioners and actually go on to the ward and see firsthand the work that they're doing.
[01:14:08.248 --> 01:14:10.190]  And I want to let you know they're doing a great job.
[01:14:11.151 --> 01:14:14.993]  They're providing compassionate care.
[01:14:14.993 --> 01:14:23.337]  They have a committed staff that are providing top-notch care, and they're doing that in a safe environment.
[01:14:23.337 --> 01:14:26.539]  They have a whole ward that's dedicated to the care of this individual.
[01:14:26.539 --> 01:14:39.826]  They have a whole team of, again, professionals that are very competent, caring for this individual, and are doing it, as I noted, in a very safe, compassionate environment, providing excellent care.
[01:14:40.905 --> 01:14:54.131]  Now, obviously this disease is scary to a large number of individuals, but I think some of the points that Dr. Frieden emphasized yesterday need to be stated.
[01:14:54.131 --> 01:15:02.394]  One of those statements that he said, and I want to reiterate, is that people cannot transmit this disease until they have symptoms.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:06.801]  Okay, and so individuals that do not have symptoms are not going to pass.
[01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:07.981]  Yeah, let's jump in there.
[01:15:07.981 --> 01:15:10.202]  Let's try and go back to that conference.
[01:15:10.202 --> 01:15:14.983]  If they take questions, obviously we want to try and get one or two in.
[01:15:14.983 --> 01:15:25.206]  David, the spokesman there that came on after Perry was basically saying that they put protocols in place, they were preparing for this for a long time, and yet they completely botched the response.
[01:15:25.206 --> 01:15:26.927]  They sent this Ebola victim home.
[01:15:27.927 --> 01:15:28.828]  That's the thing.
[01:15:28.828 --> 01:15:48.338]  They want to tell us, they want to argue that we shouldn't worry because they are hyper-competent and yet they won't even address why they just diagnosed him with some antibiotics and a cold or whatever the diagnosis was and sent him back home for another two days to expose family members and other people in the community and then the ambulance workers as well.
[01:15:48.338 --> 01:15:49.679]  They now have, I believe it's
[01:15:50.519 --> 01:15:55.861]  The latest news that I saw was 12 to 18 people are being monitored.
[01:15:55.861 --> 01:15:57.362]  They've tested the ambulance crew.
[01:15:57.362 --> 01:16:01.843]  They say that they have tested negative for Ebola, but they're still keeping them isolated.
[01:16:01.843 --> 01:16:05.705]  But it doesn't inspire confidence when they won't address their failings, and we've seen this.
[01:16:06.345 --> 01:16:11.186]  From Business Insider, they put out an article with three points saying why we shouldn't panic.
[01:16:11.186 --> 01:16:14.327]  And they say, well, they know exactly how to control the virus.
[01:16:14.327 --> 01:16:17.508]  They know what precautions to be taken to treat the virus.
[01:16:17.508 --> 01:16:28.271]  And yet, why do we have over 200 doctors and nurses that have died in Africa treating this if they completely know the protocols to keep this contained?
[01:16:28.271 --> 01:16:34.313]  That makes me concerned that they don't understand fully the methods of the means of transmission.
[01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:38.298]  Uh, they also want to say that it's not very contagious, that it doesn't spread through the air.
[01:16:38.298 --> 01:16:41.382]  Harry started out by saying, this is harder to catch than a common cold.
[01:16:41.382 --> 01:16:49.473]  Well, you know, you can catch a cold from, uh, inhaling what somebody sneezes out, and certainly if this is transmitted by bodily fluids, if somebody sneezes with Ebola,
[01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:56.757]  You know, where you touch anything, where their bodily fluids were, where they're bleeding, you're going to get it.
[01:16:56.757 --> 01:17:00.940]  So, it is very contagious and it can be spread through the air, as you've pointed out many times.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:04.923]  I've had animal studies that show that certain strains would transmit through the air.
[01:17:04.923 --> 01:17:06.724]  So, we're not really certain about that.
[01:17:06.724 --> 01:17:14.449]  When I look at the number of doctors and nurses that have died, I wonder if maybe that might be part of the reason that they don't fully credit the means of transmission.
[01:17:15.219 --> 01:17:21.563]  And these are health professionals that take precautions to the nth degree and hundreds of them have died in West Africa.
[01:17:21.563 --> 01:17:24.505]  We're told that it could only be transmitted via bodily fluids.
[01:17:24.505 --> 01:17:30.930]  But we've also got the CDC advising airlines to take precautions so as not to allow the airborne spread of the virus.
[01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:37.935]  So we know that they are concerned about this despite the fact that Perry almost immediately in that press conference said that this is not airborne.
[01:17:37.935 --> 01:17:43.739]  Another concern, David, of course, is the fact that this ambulance in which this Ebola victim was transported to the hospital
[01:17:44.239 --> 01:17:52.901]  was in use for two days afterwards before they identified him, before they confirmed him and isolated him as an Ebola sufferer.
[01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:58.682]  Let's go back briefly to this press conference to see if we're going to get any actual answers.
[01:17:58.682 --> 01:18:10.765]  They're marching orders and understand the importance of that good collaboration, that good partnering from the state right through our federal partners with the CDC.
[01:18:13.414 --> 01:18:21.597]  To those of you in the media for any questions and individuals on the podium here can respond.
[01:18:21.597 --> 01:18:22.177]  I beg your pardon?
[01:18:22.177 --> 01:18:29.660]  Sorry.
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:33.522]  Can't hear the question.
[01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:38.324]  We're categorizing his condition as serious but stable.
[01:18:44.824 --> 01:18:45.365]  Yeah, we're not sure.
[01:18:45.365 --> 01:18:47.307]  We can't hear with this press conference.
[01:18:47.307 --> 01:18:50.210]  We can't hear with the questions that people are asking in the audience.
[01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:51.512]  And we're not getting much in terms of replies.
[01:18:51.512 --> 01:18:56.097]  That checklist was in place for Ebola in this hospital for several weeks.
[01:18:56.097 --> 01:19:01.123]  And Dr. Ed Goodman, to my right, had led the implementation of that.
[01:19:01.123 --> 01:19:05.728]  That checklist was utilized by the nurse who did ask that question.
[01:19:07.239 --> 01:19:13.860]  That nurse was part of a care team and it was a complex care team taking care of him in the emergency department.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:21.421]  I think somebody asked if they... Regretfully, that information was not fully communicated throughout the full team.
[01:19:21.421 --> 01:19:28.843]  And as a result, the full import of that information wasn't factored in to the clinical decision making.
[01:19:28.843 --> 01:19:35.864]  The overall clinical presentation was not typical at that time yet for Ebola.
[01:19:36.483 --> 01:19:42.726]  So as the team assessed him, they felt clinically it was a low-grade common viral disease.
[01:19:42.726 --> 01:19:44.327]  That was the presentation.
[01:19:44.327 --> 01:19:48.849]  He's talking about why they failed to diagnose him the first time the guy came in.
[01:19:48.849 --> 01:19:50.410]  Did they ask him where he was coming from?
[01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:59.434]  He volunteered that he had traveled from Africa in response to the nurse operating the checklist and asking that question.
[01:20:04.571 --> 01:20:08.033]  That differs from what we were told before because they said he was sent home and given antibiotics.
[01:20:08.033 --> 01:20:15.897]  I can't answer that question because that's one piece of information that would be factored into the entire clinical picture.
[01:20:15.897 --> 01:20:24.762]  The clinicians did not factor it in, so it was not part of their decision making.
[01:20:24.762 --> 01:20:30.125]  I think that was a question from Joe, but I can't quite get it.
[01:20:33.513 --> 01:20:37.394]  Yeah, Biggs was asking if the flights are going to be shut down from West Africa.
[01:20:37.394 --> 01:20:41.854]  That's a question that's really not in my domain.
[01:20:41.854 --> 01:20:43.495]  It's not in his domain.
[01:20:43.495 --> 01:20:47.755]  He's the CDC.
[01:20:47.755 --> 01:20:51.556]  So Biggs just asked if the flights are going to be shut down and he basically avoided the question.
[01:20:51.556 --> 01:20:54.937]  It's being investigated, so we are investigating it.
[01:20:54.937 --> 01:21:00.618]  I can't give you specific information, but we will look very carefully at that.
[01:21:00.618 --> 01:21:02.758]  What do you call that a misstep?
[01:21:03.069 --> 01:21:06.511]  Would you not?
[01:21:06.511 --> 01:21:16.516]  So now, one of the media representatives said that it was a misstep, so they're confronting him on the mistake that led to this guy being able to walk back around Dallas for a couple of days.
[01:21:16.516 --> 01:21:24.380]  So that all the information wasn't present as they made their clinical decision.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.501]  All the information wasn't present.
[01:21:27.796 --> 01:21:29.397]  That's your point when you're diagnosing.
[01:21:29.397 --> 01:21:36.623]  That information was not obtained when the patient was in the emergency room.
[01:21:36.623 --> 01:21:38.925]  It was not obtained because they failed to obtain it.
[01:21:38.925 --> 01:21:45.490]  I'm Dr. Mark Lester, and I'm an Executive Vice President with Texas Health Resources.
[01:21:45.490 --> 01:21:49.693]  I'm the Zone Clinical Leader for the Southeast Zone in Texas Health Resources.
[01:21:49.693 --> 01:21:52.415]  But it seems the media are asking real questions, which is good.
[01:21:52.415 --> 01:21:54.157]  This guy's getting quite a grilling.
[01:21:59.146 --> 01:22:07.194]  Well remember, it's unprotected exposure to the bodily fluids that constitutes an exposure.
[01:22:07.194 --> 01:22:16.962]  And so very carefully, and together with the CDC, we're investigating how many people that might be and how they might be monitored if that's so.
[01:22:16.962 --> 01:22:22.808]  Does that mean nothing?
[01:22:22.808 --> 01:22:25.150]  As I said, we're investigating that right now.
[01:22:31.121 --> 01:22:39.025]  People in the Liberian community are saying they want to know who he's had contact with, so these people can go and get tested to see if they have it, so they can isolate it, keep it from spreading.
[01:22:39.025 --> 01:22:45.129]  They won't tell anybody anything about this guy, whether he's a citizen, anything about him.
[01:22:45.129 --> 01:22:49.211]  They won't put this information out there, so people can take precautions themselves.
[01:22:50.123 --> 01:22:54.485]  And so far, no comments on the possible second case, which we talked about earlier.
[01:22:54.485 --> 01:23:02.808]  One of the Health and Human Services Department officials said that there was a possible second Ebola case.
[01:23:02.808 --> 01:23:18.615]  At the press conference outside Dallas Presbyterian Hospital, Rick Perry just spoke, a CDC official just spoke, and Joe Biggs managed to get a question in there asking if the flights would be shut down into the United States from West Africa, Air France, British Airways, United Arab Emirates.
[01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:21.596]  Emirates Airlines have done that.
[01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:24.998]  The CDC official, David, kind of sidestepped the question.
[01:23:24.998 --> 01:23:36.103]  He said it wasn't his domain, which is why, you know, we're encouraging people to call the White House and have this get behind this campaign to shut down the flights because several other countries have done it.
[01:23:36.103 --> 01:23:39.585]  It seems like a reasonable precaution to take.
[01:23:39.585 --> 01:23:42.206]  It's not as if there is a huge volume of
[01:23:42.506 --> 01:23:57.739]  Air traffic from Liberia, for example, I noticed in the Daily Mail article there were just a few flights a week going into Britain, so I can't imagine it's too many more going into the United States, so it's not as if this would be a huge economic impact on the economy.
[01:23:57.739 --> 01:24:02.303]  If these flights were cancelled, it seems like a sensible precaution to take, David.
[01:24:02.723 --> 01:24:07.925]  Well, as I mentioned when I first came in at the top of the hour, some of the stations were on a news break at that time.
[01:24:07.925 --> 01:24:13.627]  This is something that they've been doing for dogs coming into the United Kingdom for a very, very long time.
[01:24:13.627 --> 01:24:15.528]  For over a century.
[01:24:15.528 --> 01:24:17.108]  They just stopped it in 2012.
[01:24:17.108 --> 01:24:25.531]  They would quarantine any animals that were being brought in the UK for six months to test them to see if they were positive for rabies or a variety of other diseases.
[01:24:25.531 --> 01:24:26.692]  They changed that in 2012, but they still
[01:24:28.232 --> 01:24:32.077]  Hold animals that are coming in from preferred areas like the EU and the United States.
[01:24:32.077 --> 01:24:34.280]  They still hold them for 21 days.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.364]  They hold animals coming in from elsewhere.
[01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:39.526]  They hold them still for three months.
[01:24:39.526 --> 01:24:43.812]  Why do we, why are we more concerned about the health of dogs than we are about
[01:24:44.605 --> 01:24:47.366]  The health of Americans or people here.
[01:24:47.366 --> 01:24:56.950]  Clearly they're, in my opinion, they don't want to get this thing under control until, or not make any efforts to try to do that until it gets out of hand.
[01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:59.231]  And then they will get very heavy handed.
[01:24:59.231 --> 01:25:00.532]  Then they will bring in martial law.
[01:25:00.532 --> 01:25:02.233]  Then they'll bring in mandatory quarantines.
[01:25:02.953 --> 01:25:04.574]  That's what they've been preparing for.
[01:25:04.574 --> 01:25:06.775]  They haven't been preparing to contain a disease.
[01:25:06.775 --> 01:25:08.996]  They've been preparing for martial law.
[01:25:08.996 --> 01:25:12.537]  And this is one more way that they could bring this in.
[01:25:12.537 --> 01:25:19.581]  So it looks to me that it is something more than just vast incompetence and clearly the kind of dodging that we've seen.
[01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:24.863]  We've seen them say that we should not worry about this because they fully understand it and yet they don't have a cure for it.
[01:25:25.183 --> 01:25:44.379]  They don't know how it's transmitted because we've had over 200 doctors and nurses die in Africa from this treatment and then they want to tell us how professional they are and yet they can't or won't explain why they didn't diagnose this guy when he first presented himself at the hospital but rather sent him home and then picked him up a couple of days later with an ambulance.
[01:25:45.572 --> 01:25:51.035]  And, I mean, I go back to this comparison again and again with the swine flu outbreak back in 2009.
[01:25:51.035 --> 01:25:58.078]  The hysteria that preceded that, which was being generated, whipped up by the media and by officials, was intense.
[01:25:58.078 --> 01:26:01.840]  They were talking about troops on the streets in numerous countries across the world.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.281]  Of course, it never happened.
[01:26:03.281 --> 01:26:14.807]  What did happen was the mass generation of profits from the sale of a swine flu vaccine, which was basically unnecessary for huge numbers of populations of countries around the world,
[01:26:15.467 --> 01:26:22.114]  Basically, you were only at risk of getting swine flu, of dying from swine flu, if you were either elderly, young or sick.
[01:26:22.114 --> 01:26:25.597]  So that left out the vast majority of the population.
[01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:34.666]  But they did get these swine flu vaccines, which created millions and millions of profits for these pharmaceutical companies who had the vaccine lined up.
[01:26:35.126 --> 01:26:37.388]  Before the hysteria, before the panic.
[01:26:37.388 --> 01:26:44.052]  Of course, in the case of Ebola, we've got discussion of the ZMapp drug in development.
[01:26:44.052 --> 01:26:50.777]  We've got discussion of patents for Ebola viruses for vaccines, but nothing really firmly established.
[01:26:50.777 --> 01:26:58.723]  So, in the absence of that financial motive, it seems that the CDC at the moment is trying to downplay the concerns.
[01:26:58.723 --> 01:27:02.846]  Of course, our concerns, which we've voiced on numerous occasions, are the fact that
[01:27:03.306 --> 01:27:23.491]  They have measures in place, the CDC, to quarantine quote well persons who do not show symptoms of any respiratory disease and of course Obama signed an executive order back at the end of July where he said that basically any American could be detained, could be quarantined if they show any sign of respiratory illness.
[01:27:23.491 --> 01:27:27.392]  So we've got the architecture of medical martial law targeting people
[01:27:28.052 --> 01:27:53.933]  Not even showing symptoms of Ebola seems to be directed more against the American people amongst the establishing coalescing power within the medical establishment and yet they're caught with their pants down with this one Ebola victim who walks into a hospital in Dallas after having arrived in Dallas from Liberia is asked zero questions about his travel history given antibiotics and sent home.
[01:27:53.933 --> 01:27:55.655]  David, final comments on that before the break?
[01:27:56.155 --> 01:27:57.736]  Yeah, that's the amazing thing to me.
[01:27:57.736 --> 01:28:06.043]  That's what I would expect them, if they were going to be candid and honest and forthcoming, I would expect them to address that incompetence up front.
[01:28:06.043 --> 01:28:19.014]  Instead, all they did was they gave us happy news about how they've been training for this, they're prepared for this, and we have the best medical facilities anywhere on the planet here in Texas, and never addressed that, and then dodged the question, essentially saying, well,
[01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.936]  That information wasn't obtained, that's why he was sent home.
[01:28:21.936 --> 01:28:25.218]  It's like, that's your job to obtain the information.
[01:28:25.218 --> 01:28:31.543]  So if they don't understand that's their job, if they don't do their job, why should we be reassured about their competence?
[01:28:31.543 --> 01:28:35.826]  But you mentioned the ZMapp vaccine.
[01:28:35.826 --> 01:28:40.850]  That's something that everybody heard about when those first two came back with Samaritan's Purse.
[01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:43.131]  Dr. Brantley and the other lady too.
[01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:45.052]  Emory University.
[01:29:04.838 --> 01:29:11.764]  That's not substantially better in terms of effectiveness than the people, than the general population numbers in Liberia where it's so high.
[01:29:11.764 --> 01:29:16.769]  They're having 53% casualties so far but they say of the people that are not yet dead...
[01:29:17.757 --> 01:29:28.783]  They believe that those casual rates are going to go to 70% effectively because that's why it's staying down at 50% because people have contracted it and are being treated, have not yet died, but they expect them to.
[01:29:28.783 --> 01:29:34.066]  So it doesn't look at this point like it's essentially much better than not being treated at all.
[01:29:34.066 --> 01:29:36.187]  And of course they exhausted their supply after seven treatments.
[01:29:37.074 --> 01:29:46.962]  And we've got your calls coming up after the break on Ebola, Gerald Solente in the next hour, David Knight riding shotgun, I'm Paul Joseph Watson hosting the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:29:46.962 --> 01:29:49.104]  Infowars.com, stay right there.
[01:29:49.104 --> 01:29:52.106]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.106 --> 01:29:55.709]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.884 --> 01:30:04.008]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[01:30:04.008 --> 01:30:08.552]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:30:08.552 --> 01:30:15.078]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:30:15.078 --> 01:30:19.082]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[01:30:19.082 --> 01:30:20.743]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:31:25.971 --> 01:31:26.531]  DNA Force.
[01:31:29.893 --> 01:31:33.555]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:33.555 --> 01:31:37.838]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:37.838 --> 01:31:39.619]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:39.619 --> 01:31:47.484]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:47.484 --> 01:31:48.624]  But for how long?

[01:32:05.141 --> 01:32:11.645]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[01:32:11.645 --> 01:32:20.011]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.

[01:33:07.973 --> 01:33:15.678]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:22.273 --> 01:33:27.494]  Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones today on this Wednesday, October 1st, 2014 edition.
[01:33:27.494 --> 01:33:29.034]  Obviously we're talking about Ebola.
[01:33:29.034 --> 01:33:31.195]  We're going to go to your calls shortly.
[01:33:31.195 --> 01:33:33.315]  But an interesting article popped up.
[01:33:33.315 --> 01:33:36.636]  Some information that's not been heard so far.
[01:33:36.636 --> 01:33:45.458]  Not confirmed, but interesting nonetheless from a potential CDC source talking about the travel history of this Ebola victim.
[01:33:45.458 --> 01:33:46.738]  David Knight, you have the story.
[01:33:47.478 --> 01:33:49.359]  Yes, this is from redstate.com.
[01:33:49.359 --> 01:33:51.700]  Eric Erickson is the person who runs that site.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:55.162]  He's got a radio show in Atlanta, where of course the CDC is headquartered.
[01:33:55.162 --> 01:34:00.144]  And he said during the break of his radio station, an individual called the program, said he worked for the CDC.
[01:34:00.144 --> 01:34:03.766]  He says that he vetted the individual, established his credibility and everything.
[01:34:03.766 --> 01:34:04.547]  The guy said that...
[01:34:05.407 --> 01:34:05.868]  We're good to go.
[01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:29.195]  And all this information was provided before the details came out in press conferences.
[01:34:29.195 --> 01:34:36.806]  Now one of the interesting things that he says is that this person from the CDC told him that he went to the hospital with symptoms on the 24th.
[01:34:38.508 --> 01:34:47.376]  And they're saying in the press conferences that the first time he went to the hospital was the 26th, that he was starting to have symptoms at home, but waited for two days before he went to the hospital.
[01:34:47.376 --> 01:34:49.598]  They sent him home and he came back another two days.
[01:34:49.598 --> 01:34:56.163]  So that stretches out the symptoms a little bit earlier, moves it a little bit more forward, if that's true.
[01:34:56.163 --> 01:34:59.626]  And he says he assumed that the guy was confused because the press conference said the 26th.
[01:35:00.667 --> 01:35:10.171]  So he texted the source and the source came back and confirmed that yes he came in on the 20th and that he went to the emergency room with symptoms on the 24th.
[01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:20.714]  That would be very important because I would imagine anybody that had gone to the emergency room at the hospital on the day in question would want to present themselves to have testing.
[01:35:20.714 --> 01:35:24.936]  So perhaps even somebody on the 24th might want to take that precaution.
[01:35:25.456 --> 01:35:30.823]  He said they discharged him with antibiotics and he returned again days later with watery diarrhea and other symptoms.
[01:35:30.823 --> 01:35:37.471]  They tested him at that time for malaria and then Ebola and then put him in isolation on the 28th.
[01:35:37.471 --> 01:35:40.215]  So that's the information we have from that source.
[01:35:40.862 --> 01:35:45.323]  So obviously the suggestion there is that he didn't fly directly to Dallas.
[01:35:45.323 --> 01:35:50.184]  I think we should probably check the flights from Liberia to Dallas if that is a direct flight.
[01:35:50.184 --> 01:35:54.165]  You're saying that... There are no direct flights from Liberia to Dallas.
[01:35:54.165 --> 01:36:01.087]  I looked at several of them and of course you get a wide range of ways that you can get here depending on the airline that you go.
[01:36:01.807 --> 01:36:04.888]  Minimum, you're going to go for 22 hours and two stops.
[01:36:04.888 --> 01:36:08.508]  You can go as much as 33 hours and three stops, and it depends.
[01:36:08.508 --> 01:36:12.869]  I mean, it can take you through Brussels, Paris, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Houston.
[01:36:12.869 --> 01:36:16.670]  There's a lot of different cities that these different flights stop by.
[01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:26.532]  And of course, merely the fact that somebody doesn't present any symptoms of fever when they're getting on the plane doesn't mean that these symptoms won't begin during a 33-hour journey.
[01:36:26.532 --> 01:36:28.672]  So that's quite a long period of time.
[01:36:29.594 --> 01:36:34.842]  One other thing that I thought was kind of interesting is one doctor, one American doctor, who's currently being treated for Ebola.
[01:36:36.326 --> 01:36:44.848]  It says that he believes that he got it because he operated on a patient with a cesarean section, giving her a cesarean section, and did not know that she had Ebola.
[01:36:44.848 --> 01:36:52.789]  So the question is, if this is the way that they're going to diagnose it early on and start to question people is by fever, they didn't take her temperature?
[01:36:52.789 --> 01:36:56.810]  I mean, you know, when we go to the hospital, they're constantly taking your temperature.
[01:36:56.810 --> 01:37:04.492]  So they didn't notice in the hospital, according to this doctor who believes that he got it because he operated on somebody that, you know, they didn't know that she had any symptoms.
[01:37:05.996 --> 01:37:07.616]  That's just amazing.
[01:37:07.616 --> 01:37:10.277]  It's another reason that they need to halt the flights.
[01:37:10.277 --> 01:37:15.978]  It's another reason they need to tell people, we're going to keep you in isolation for 21 days if you're going to come into America.
[01:37:15.978 --> 01:37:18.019]  That's the way you stop this.
[01:37:18.019 --> 01:37:25.560]  You do it one or both of those things, whatever you do, but it could be contained if they wanted to contain it.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.160]  Okay, we're going to go to your calls now.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:31.381]  Juliano in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:37:31.381 --> 01:37:33.082]  Hey, how y'all doing, guys?
[01:37:33.082 --> 01:37:34.262]  Good, what's your comment today?
[01:37:36.261 --> 01:37:44.404]  The thing that I don't understand is why are they not warning the citizens of Dallas?
[01:37:44.404 --> 01:37:51.887]  It is a multi-cultural, so many people that are in and out of this little hub.
[01:37:51.887 --> 01:37:54.268]  It's easily going to spread.
[01:37:54.268 --> 01:37:56.669]  And they're just telling us, oh, don't worry.
[01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:59.390]  You're not going to catch it.
[01:37:59.390 --> 01:38:00.891]  Now, what are we supposed to do?
[01:38:02.622 --> 01:38:10.693]  Well it's interesting you mention that because, top story on Drudge Report right now, red-linked, kids who had contact with Ebola patient monitored.
[01:38:10.693 --> 01:38:13.136]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[01:38:13.136 --> 01:38:16.621]  I believe out of the comments we just saw earlier from Texas Governor Rick Perry.
[01:38:17.622 --> 01:38:23.664]  Who said a handful of school-aged children who had contact with a man diagnosed with Ebola are being monitored.
[01:38:23.664 --> 01:38:28.566]  So I mentioned briefly earlier the fact that some school children were being looked at.
[01:38:28.566 --> 01:38:36.369]  Perry says health officials learned Wednesday that the children have been identified as having contact with the man and are being monitored at home.
[01:38:36.369 --> 01:38:41.791]  The unidentified man has been in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital since Sunday.
[01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:44.972]  The man is the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.
[01:38:46.112 --> 01:38:48.784]  This is just the first example of...
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.904]  Other potential Ebola victims who may have been infected with the virus.
[01:38:54.904 --> 01:39:02.750]  Obviously, this guy was traveling around for at least two days, maybe even four days in contact with the community and family members.
[01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:04.952]  David Knight, your take on that?
[01:39:04.952 --> 01:39:05.693]  Well, that's just it.
[01:39:05.693 --> 01:39:15.380]  I mean, the Liberian community themselves are very concerned about this because they're in contact with friends and family living in Liberia, where this has been the worst pandemic.
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:18.103]  It's been worse even there than in Sierra Leone.
[01:39:18.743 --> 01:39:28.871]  And they're saying we don't understand why they won't tell us who this guy is so that we can, anyone who's had contact with someone, with that particular person can go get tested.
[01:39:28.871 --> 01:39:34.155]  They want to know what the person's name is, who they've been in contact with.
[01:39:34.155 --> 01:39:39.460]  And they're telling people, telling people in the Liberian community to stay away from social gatherings.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:44.524]  They're very concerned about that because they've seen how it's ravaged and completely shut down their country.
[01:39:45.776 --> 01:39:48.398]  There's a headline up on Infowars.com, how bad could it get?
[01:39:48.398 --> 01:39:48.638]  U.S.
[01:39:48.638 --> 01:39:52.581]  government order of 160,000 hazmat suits gives a clue.
[01:39:52.581 --> 01:39:56.604]  That's out of zero hedge, of course we had that story recently.
[01:39:56.604 --> 01:40:05.950]  Out of the order that this company that creates the hazmat suits got from the Department of, the State Department actually, it was that they'd ordered this huge amount of hazmat suits.
[01:40:07.131 --> 01:40:15.936]  Again, they've been preparing for this in some ways, but obviously not in the most important ways, as we saw at the Dallas Hospital there.
[01:40:15.936 --> 01:40:18.017]  Phil, in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:40:18.017 --> 01:40:19.798]  Go ahead, Phil.
[01:40:19.798 --> 01:40:21.359]  Hey, good afternoon.
[01:40:21.359 --> 01:40:27.242]  Who's to say, first of all, that he was the person that brought it on the plane?
[01:40:27.242 --> 01:40:31.484]  He could have caught it from someone for 33 hours from someone on the plane.
[01:40:32.231 --> 01:40:39.425]  And they got the recirculating air going through the aircraft, you know, for 33 hours.
[01:40:39.425 --> 01:40:42.290]  You can infect, you know, 290, 300 people who are all on that plane.
[01:40:46.288 --> 01:40:46.648]  Well, it's true.
[01:40:46.648 --> 01:40:53.331]  They're telling us that it's not airborne, but of course, if someone has it and they're sneezing or coughing, then that makes it airborne.
[01:40:53.331 --> 01:41:05.477]  The information that we reported earlier from the person who called into a radio show in Atlanta, Eric Erickson's radio show, had said that the patient had come from a funeral in Liberia, so that might indicate that he was the carrier.
[01:41:06.737 --> 01:41:16.401]  The key thing is that you isolate people before you put them in an enclosed area, like an airplane, before you bring them to the country.
[01:41:16.401 --> 01:41:18.002]  It's a 21-day period.
[01:41:18.002 --> 01:41:26.145]  If we do it for dogs in the UK, we can do it for people who are coming from an area that's infected with this pandemic.
[01:41:26.145 --> 01:41:27.066]  It's not that difficult.
[01:41:27.742 --> 01:41:36.293]  And of course, we had the story back on August 4th on Infowars.com, CDC concerned about airborne transmission of Ebola virus.
[01:41:36.293 --> 01:41:42.582]  Basically, from their own documents, interim guidance about Ebola virus infection for airline flight crews, they
[01:41:42.882 --> 01:41:55.207]  advised airline staff to provide surgical masks to potential Ebola victims in order to quote, reduce the number of droplets expelled into the air by talking, sneezing or coughing.
[01:41:55.207 --> 01:42:04.790]  The CDC also directs airline cleaning personnel to quote, not use compressed air which might spread infectious material through the air.
[01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:11.553]  So this was two months ago almost that they were directing airline flight crews to take precautions
[01:42:12.513 --> 01:42:19.741]  With flights, the potential that Ebola could spread, at least to a limited extent, through sneezing and coughing.
[01:42:19.741 --> 01:42:20.481]  David Knight?
[01:42:20.481 --> 01:42:26.227]  You know, Paul, I think back to when HIV first appeared and people really didn't know.
[01:42:26.227 --> 01:42:30.031]  Could this be transmitted by a mosquito biting somebody and then biting someone else?
[01:42:31.532 --> 01:42:44.360]  When you have a situation like this, and you don't really truly understand all the modes of transmission, and I would suggest that they truly don't understand all the modes of transmission, or you wouldn't have 200 nurses and doctors who have died in-country.
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:48.243]  I mean, are they just being, are they just overworked and tired, making careless mistakes?
[01:42:48.903 --> 01:42:49.944]  Kelly in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:42:49.944 --> 01:42:50.484]  Go ahead, Kelly.
[01:42:50.484 --> 01:42:51.344]  Good afternoon, General.
[01:42:51.344 --> 01:42:52.385]  God bless you both.
[01:43:13.066 --> 01:43:18.527]  Typically this patient that went to the hospital and then he was turned away, is it not common?
[01:43:18.527 --> 01:43:27.030]  I think it's typically they send you to a pharmacy to get your meds and not getting to you there at the hospital since they send them away.
[01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:36.032]  And also the second person, if it was a family member, did they not go to a store or somewhere to get this person food or stuff for comfort and liquids?
[01:43:37.004 --> 01:43:43.862]  And, uh, wasn't there a story out that they've proven that Ebola was airborne between piglets and monkeys?
[01:43:44.542 --> 01:43:47.843]  They ended up having to slaughter all of them because of that?
[01:43:47.843 --> 01:43:48.763]  That's right.
[01:43:48.763 --> 01:43:50.884]  That was a 2012 Canadian study.
[01:43:50.884 --> 01:43:56.506]  They basically took pigs, put them in a pen with monkeys separated only by a wire fence.
[01:43:56.506 --> 01:43:58.907]  Pigs infected with the Ebola virus.
[01:43:58.907 --> 01:44:04.889]  And the monkeys caught the virus via airborne transmission via the respiratory system and they died basically.
[01:44:04.889 --> 01:44:09.911]  So they proved that at least to a limited extent Ebola had gone airborne back in 2012.
[01:44:11.351 --> 01:44:22.135]  The Associated Press is reporting that 16 to 18 people are now being monitored as having potentially been exposed to this Ebola virus there in Texas.
[01:44:22.135 --> 01:44:28.537]  So as you said, this individual could have gone to the pharmacy to get his antibiotics, he could have gone to the store.
[01:44:28.537 --> 01:44:31.198]  And then these 16 to 18 other people could have interacted
[01:44:31.778 --> 01:44:34.660]  You know, with their family members, with their friends, with their relatives.
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:38.302]  So, this is obviously of concern, but thanks for the call.
[01:44:38.302 --> 01:44:40.143]  We're going to Joshua in Texas.
[01:44:40.143 --> 01:44:41.123]  Joshua, you're on the air.
[01:44:41.123 --> 01:44:42.604]  Go ahead.
[01:44:42.604 --> 01:44:43.064]  Uh, yes, sir.
[01:44:43.064 --> 01:44:46.186]  Actually, uh, I, uh, first I'd like to say thanks for taking my call.
[01:44:46.186 --> 01:44:47.967]  Um, I got in pretty quick.
[01:44:47.967 --> 01:44:52.029]  Um, I, I did what you guys suggested, and I did call the, uh, the White House.
[01:44:52.029 --> 01:44:58.212]  I got a, I got a hold of the, uh, uh, I believe it was a, uh, comment board or something like that.
[01:44:58.212 --> 01:44:59.173]  It was a switchboard.
[01:44:59.173 --> 01:45:00.874]  And I asked the lady who was on there, um,
[01:45:01.645 --> 01:45:10.670]  Asked her, why is the President not allowing flights to be stopped from West Africa when countries such as the United Arab Emirates, France, and Britain are doing so?
[01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:17.373]  And she told me that she refused to comment on it and that she would pass my comments along to the President.
[01:45:17.373 --> 01:45:22.075]  I then asked her, is the President doing this intentionally?
[01:45:22.075 --> 01:45:23.156]  Is he so incompetent?
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:27.967]  That he's going to allow this to continue and she refused to take my comments.
[01:45:27.967 --> 01:45:30.311]  So I just wanted to go ahead and put that out there.
[01:45:30.311 --> 01:45:31.313]  I just want to let you guys know that.
[01:45:31.906 --> 01:45:33.067]  Well, that's precisely the issue.
[01:45:33.067 --> 01:45:37.911]  I mean, it is either the most astounding incompetence we've ever seen, or it's a deliberate policy.
[01:45:37.911 --> 01:45:41.755]  Neither one of them are a good outcome of this.
[01:45:41.755 --> 01:45:42.855]  But we see this over and over again.
[01:45:42.855 --> 01:45:48.440]  Nobody in the government wants to say anything, give us any information.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:54.726]  They have absolutely nothing but contempt for our right to know information, and they just want to protect their job.
[01:45:55.697 --> 01:46:01.138]  I think a good idea would be to maybe start a petition on the petitions.whitehouse.gov website.
[01:46:01.138 --> 01:46:03.279]  Maybe we can get the writers on that.
[01:46:03.279 --> 01:46:05.079]  It's probably already there, to be honest.
[01:46:05.079 --> 01:46:15.121]  I would assume that some people have demanded that they halt flights out of West Africa in the past, but we could start a new petition on that website, write an article about it and get people behind that.
[01:46:15.121 --> 01:46:18.122]  Obviously only people in the United States can sign those petitions.
[01:46:18.122 --> 01:46:19.723]  It's on record who they are.
[01:46:19.723 --> 01:46:20.943]  So that might be a good way to
[01:46:21.863 --> 01:46:30.365]  Corral people around this urgent activist issue of trying to encourage the White House to stop those flights coming in out of West Africa.
[01:46:30.365 --> 01:46:33.406]  Dave in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:46:33.406 --> 01:46:39.907]  Hey guys, I just wanted to talk to you about something that I heard in that press conference that's ridiculous.
[01:46:39.907 --> 01:46:46.189]  Apparently this guy was sent home with antibiotics for a virus, and by the way, I'm an ER nurse.
[01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:48.890]  I interviewed at Presbyterian Dallas last Friday.
[01:46:48.890 --> 01:46:50.150]  It was in another department, but
[01:46:50.785 --> 01:46:56.668]  Getting back to this prescription, you don't prescribe antibiotics for a virus.
[01:46:56.668 --> 01:46:57.088]  Yes.
[01:46:57.088 --> 01:46:57.908]  Not ever.
[01:46:57.908 --> 01:46:58.969]  Yes.
[01:46:58.969 --> 01:47:00.530]  It's completely ineffective.
[01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:06.112]  So, them claiming that there were no symptoms, that's an absolute lie.
[01:47:06.112 --> 01:47:09.154]  There had to have been symptoms to prescribe antibiotics.
[01:47:09.154 --> 01:47:10.474]  Period.
[01:47:10.474 --> 01:47:14.576]  Now, those symptoms may not have been a virus, but they were symptoms.
[01:47:14.576 --> 01:47:19.999]  So, you know, that whole thing is a bunch of BS, and as for, you know, not canceling flights out of West Africa,
[01:47:20.689 --> 01:47:27.631]  I don't think it takes a genius to realize, you know, specifically what's going on here, because that's 101.
[01:47:27.631 --> 01:47:40.634]  We've actually got the name, if I could just stop you there, Dave, of the Ebola victim, Thomas Eric Duncan is the name now being confirmed, who left Liberia on September 19th, arrived in Dallas the following day.
[01:47:40.634 --> 01:47:48.456]  As we mentioned earlier, he had to go through at least two other airports to get there, maybe Brussels, maybe Washington Dulles, maybe Paris.
[01:47:49.096 --> 01:47:54.460]  But Thomas Eric Duncan has been named as the Ebola victim there in Dallas.
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:48:02.065]  I saw another tweet, I believe on the same article, if you scroll down a little bit, saying that he's now in serious condition.
[01:48:02.065 --> 01:48:03.646]  So he's not a citizen.
[01:48:03.646 --> 01:48:05.127]  They pointedly avoided that.
[01:48:05.127 --> 01:48:09.210]  They said they asked him for his social security number when they were getting a prescription and he said he didn't have one.
[01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:13.313]  They also have the name of his sister that he was visiting.
[01:48:13.313 --> 01:48:14.114]  Can you read that, Paul?
[01:48:15.061 --> 01:48:23.565]  Uh, it was My M-K-I... Duncan, yeah, My Wure, is the name of his sister, not sure about the pronunciation, said he... W-U-R-E-H.
[01:48:23.565 --> 01:48:40.893]  ...said he notified officials that he was visiting from Liberia when they asked for his social security number, and he told them he didn't have one, so this is not a US citizen by the looks of it, but now his name has been confirmed as Thomas Eric Duncan, and now they're saying that he's in, quote, serious condition.
[01:48:40.893 --> 01:48:44.275]  I believe in the press conference we went to earlier, they said he was stable,
[01:48:44.815 --> 01:48:48.477]  So it seems his condition has now worsened, David Knight.
[01:48:48.477 --> 01:48:49.577]  That's a shame.
[01:48:49.577 --> 01:48:51.658]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:48:51.658 --> 01:49:02.863]  You know, to be clear, they're not going to be able to stop flights coming from West Africa to the United States because, of course, they're going to have to go to intermediate destinations before they get here.
[01:49:02.863 --> 01:49:05.484]  There aren't any direct flights from Liberia.
[01:49:05.484 --> 01:49:13.888]  But what they need to do is they need to vet individuals and not clear them for flight to the United States if they are not quarantined.
[01:49:14.628 --> 01:49:18.892]  And so that needs to be focused on that in terms of the detail of the policy.
[01:49:18.892 --> 01:49:20.293]  Of course there aren't any direct flights.
[01:49:20.293 --> 01:49:21.995]  I know people are going to complain about that.
[01:49:21.995 --> 01:49:26.158]  Yes, we are aware that you can't get a direct flight from Liberia to the United States.
[01:49:26.158 --> 01:49:35.587]  Nevertheless, the principle involved that you're going to vet people, that you're going to watch them the same way they do dogs coming into the United Kingdom.
[01:49:35.587 --> 01:49:36.768]  It's just a quarantine method.
[01:49:37.188 --> 01:49:46.917]  And it's a way to keep it contained before it gets to the point where they're going to start enacting martial law and letting FEMA run riot over the United States, which is really what they want.
[01:49:46.917 --> 01:49:48.358]  That's what they've been preparing for.
[01:49:48.358 --> 01:49:51.061]  They haven't been preparing for containment of a disease.
[01:49:51.061 --> 01:49:54.044]  They've been preparing for containment of the population.
[01:49:54.044 --> 01:49:55.105]  And this is what they want.
[01:49:55.105 --> 01:49:57.186]  They want something to happen.
[01:49:57.186 --> 01:49:58.087]  I believe that it's not...
[01:49:59.159 --> 01:50:00.360]  Staggering incompetence.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.841]  I believe that it's a deliberate plan.
[01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:07.046]  That they're deliberately opening the borders and not screening people for these diseases.
[01:50:08.203 --> 01:50:13.988]  And a lot of these Africans coming and flying into Europe, for example, are obviously immigrants.
[01:50:13.988 --> 01:50:16.450]  France has a lot of African immigrants.
[01:50:16.450 --> 01:50:29.042]  Air France, from the article I was reading earlier, they did ban direct flights from Liberia, so obviously those first ports of call in many countries, Arab Emirates, United Arab Emirates was the other one.
[01:50:29.662 --> 01:50:34.164]  They have banned certain flights coming in from West Africa, so they've taken that precaution.
[01:50:34.164 --> 01:50:36.305]  We'll be back with more of your calls.

[01:54:23.387 --> 01:54:26.748]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson covering the latest Ebola news.
[01:54:26.748 --> 01:54:29.069]  Gerald Solente is coming up in the next segment.
[01:54:29.069 --> 01:54:34.690]  We're going to switch gears, talk about Syria, geopolitics, the Middle East and the latest financial news.
[01:54:34.690 --> 01:54:37.211]  But now we're going to go to the final two callers.
[01:54:37.211 --> 01:54:40.812]  Alex in Wisconsin, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:54:40.812 --> 01:54:41.933]  Can you hear me?
[01:54:41.933 --> 01:54:42.533]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:54:43.530 --> 01:55:01.525]  Yeah, I work in mold and asbestos remediation, and I just can't help ever, I've been following the Ebola situation, and I can't help that even the most basic things we use for contamination in our suits, such as duct taping over the sleeve work and at the ankles, they're just not doing anything.
[01:55:01.525 --> 01:55:03.046]  And it's really kind of surprising me.
[01:55:03.046 --> 01:55:09.511]  I was wondering if you guys think it's possibly some sort of false flag operations.
[01:55:09.511 --> 01:55:10.252]  I've heard things that
[01:55:10.942 --> 01:55:16.463]  There may be somebody poisoning the wells down there, which is causing similar symptoms to Ebola.
[01:55:17.737 --> 01:55:23.979]  Yeah, I mean, there have been a lot of theories from the local population in those African countries about that.
[01:55:23.979 --> 01:55:28.340]  Potential, you know, false flag, deliberate infection, testing by the United States.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:34.502]  None of that's been confirmed, but those rumours have been flying, and yet, I mean, hundreds of health workers have died.
[01:55:34.502 --> 01:55:41.824]  You would expect them to take the proper precautions, given that it's not airborne as far as we're being told, but hundreds have died.
[01:55:41.824 --> 01:55:44.265]  We're going to fit in the final caller here, Robert in Canada.
[01:55:44.265 --> 01:55:44.865]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:46.325]  Hey, thanks for having me on.
[01:55:46.325 --> 01:55:50.066]  Listen, it's quite obvious people need to wake up on this issue.
[01:55:50.066 --> 01:55:59.569]  You know, right now, there's a purposely enforced globalist governmental negligence in force right now.
[01:55:59.569 --> 01:56:07.031]  We need to continue to link this issue with other past issues like AIDS, genetically altering our food to make us sick.
[01:56:07.031 --> 01:56:09.432]  There's been a huge population control
[01:56:10.272 --> 01:56:11.213]  We're good to go.
[01:56:34.902 --> 01:56:36.764]  Uh, you know, they're not concerned.
[01:56:36.764 --> 01:56:40.128]  Look at the public and how they're not concerned about this in the U.S.
[01:56:40.128 --> 01:56:43.892]  They're not, because that good old USA is going to take care of us.
[01:56:43.892 --> 01:56:45.313]  Well, that's a myth.
[01:56:45.313 --> 01:56:53.982]  And they're asleep because this is how deep, this is really how deep that the brainwashing is in the U.S.
[01:56:53.982 --> 01:56:54.743]  and around the world.
[01:56:55.561 --> 01:57:01.564]  It runs very deep, and this is why these people, the public, the mass public, is hard to reach.
[01:57:01.564 --> 01:57:05.407]  You know, let me jump in here and say, this is about population control.
[01:57:05.407 --> 01:57:10.189]  It's about population control via martial laws, about population control, reducing the number of people.
[01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:12.911]  They see people as a disease.
[01:57:12.911 --> 01:57:14.392]  That's the whole Gaia theory.
[01:57:14.392 --> 01:57:16.973]  So, they're not concerned about controlling this disease.
[01:57:16.973 --> 01:57:20.135]  They want to control population in every sense of the word.
[01:57:20.135 --> 01:57:21.856]  Absolutely, you're exactly right.
[01:57:22.782 --> 01:57:38.412]  And now we're seeing New York Times reporting health officials in Dallas say Wednesday they believe the man who is first confirmed case of Ebola virus in the country had come into contact with 12 to 18 people including some school children when he was experiencing symptoms.
[01:57:38.412 --> 01:57:44.296]  So now 12 to 18 people potentially exposed to the Ebola virus.
[01:57:44.296 --> 01:57:46.238]  We're going to continue to track this.
[01:57:46.238 --> 01:57:48.099]  Gerald Salente coming up after the break.
[01:57:48.099 --> 01:57:52.722]  David Knight, final comments on this Ebola situation as we prepare to switch gears here.
[01:57:53.142 --> 01:58:02.206]  Well, you just had the first caller that we had in this segment talking about how he worked in the mold and asbestos industries, where they sealed things off, even with duct tape.
[01:58:02.206 --> 01:58:08.409]  When they brought these fellows over, the first people they brought over, they weren't putting them in level 4 biohazard facilities.
[01:58:08.409 --> 01:58:21.955]  And we interviewed people who worked on development, trying to develop Ebola vaccines, and they were absolutely appalled at the lack of proper procedures that were being taken with the people that were being born in this country, as well as into the UK.
[01:58:23.379 --> 01:58:26.000]  Third hour coming up with Gerald Solente.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:32.223]  We're going to switch gears, talk about Bitcoin, Syria, ISIS, and the global economy.
[01:58:32.223 --> 01:58:34.824]  Gerald Solente, Trends Research Journal.
[01:58:34.824 --> 01:58:37.645]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.

[02:00:12.364 --> 02:00:13.906]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.906 --> 02:00:18.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.092 --> 02:00:22.157]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.818 --> 02:00:29.060]  Third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:31.501]  It's Wednesday, October 1st, 2014 edition.
[02:00:31.501 --> 02:00:33.803]  Gerald Salente coming up.
[02:00:33.803 --> 02:00:47.993]  Rounding up the Ebola news now, of course, we just went to the press conference earlier with Joe Biggs live on the scene, Governor Rick Perry and other health officials, CDC officials trying to obviously downplay the situation, prevent hysteria.
[02:00:47.993 --> 02:00:50.535]  As I said earlier, the bigger threat than Ebola.
[02:00:51.155 --> 02:01:04.832]  Maybe the hysteria that could be engendered as a result of maybe the mishandling of this situation, which appears to be the case, with this Ebola victim who was not diagnosed on his first hospital visit.
[02:01:04.832 --> 02:01:06.313]  He was given antibiotics.
[02:01:06.914 --> 02:01:08.854]  And sent home.
[02:01:08.854 --> 02:01:12.855]  Will CDC activate emergency measures after Ebola confirmed in the US?
[02:01:12.855 --> 02:01:16.676]  That was our story yesterday, which was linked up on the Drudge Report.
[02:01:16.676 --> 02:01:33.839]  Obviously we've got these provisions in place by the CDC to quarantine healthy persons who do not show symptoms of the disease under the medical martial law infrastructure that has been established in the United States for well over a decade.
[02:01:33.839 --> 02:01:35.239]  But on the flip side, David Knight,
[02:01:36.141 --> 02:01:55.629]  They're now saying, obviously trying to downplay the situation, and I noticed quite a simpering, a lecture tone from both the mainstream media and the health authorities saying, don't panic, don't get worked up about this, and yet they're the ones who have dropped the ball, so we should really be asking even harder questions.
[02:01:55.629 --> 02:02:01.852]  Trust us, we're the professionals, there's nothing to worry about, we've trained on this, we've got this, we've been working on this for a long time, and yet they
[02:02:01.872 --> 02:02:06.273]  They do not address why they sent the guy home, failed to diagnose.
[02:02:06.273 --> 02:02:15.336]  And then when the press conference started and they were actually able to ask questions, of course that was one of the first questions that people came up with is, how could you possibly miss this?
[02:02:15.336 --> 02:02:16.976]  Well, we just didn't have the information.
[02:02:16.976 --> 02:02:17.177]  Why?
[02:02:17.177 --> 02:02:18.297]  Because they didn't ask for it.
[02:02:18.997 --> 02:02:23.759]  We have questioned the methods of transmission, whether they fully understand it.
[02:02:23.759 --> 02:02:34.802]  As I mentioned before, one of the doctors that's currently being treated for Ebola, and it's interesting that the way he's being treated is with blood transfusions from Dr. Brantley, who survived.
[02:02:34.802 --> 02:02:40.825]  And that's something that's developed as a large black market in the blood of survivors in Africa.
[02:02:40.825 --> 02:02:46.466]  But he believes that he got it from performing a cesarean on someone that was not diagnosed.
[02:02:46.466 --> 02:02:47.387]  And the question is, well, if
[02:02:48.147 --> 02:02:50.208]  It's as simple as just checking their temperature.
[02:02:50.208 --> 02:02:55.792]  If you're working in a country where there is an Ebola pandemic and you're not checking people's temperature in the hospital?
[02:02:55.792 --> 02:02:58.754]  I mean, what's... I just don't understand that.
[02:02:58.754 --> 02:03:05.157]  But I would be curious to know how Dr. Brantley and others believe that they contracted this disease.
[02:03:05.157 --> 02:03:10.361]  We've had over 200 doctors and nurses have died in West Africa.
[02:03:10.361 --> 02:03:12.202]  Many of them, many of them Westerners.
[02:03:13.002 --> 02:03:20.231]  And so it isn't a question of them having a different protocol than the CDC or Western medical authorities are saying.
[02:03:20.231 --> 02:03:25.697]  These are people who are coming over, exercising the CDC protocols and still contracting the disease.
[02:03:25.697 --> 02:03:28.541]  So does that tell us that they're being careless about this?
[02:03:28.541 --> 02:03:31.785]  Or do they just not understand fully the mode of transmission?
[02:03:32.833 --> 02:03:35.695]  And we've got an interesting quote, actually, as you mentioned there, David.
[02:03:35.695 --> 02:03:46.524]  Dr. Kent Brantley, a survivor of the disease, obviously, he reacted to this latest case, this first case of Ebola in the United States, with the following comment, which is really interesting.
[02:03:46.524 --> 02:03:55.371]  It sounds quite volatile, but he said, Many have used the analogy of a fire burning out of control to describe this unprecedented Ebola outbreak.
[02:03:55.371 --> 02:03:57.133]  Indeed, it is a fire.
[02:03:57.133 --> 02:03:59.275]  It's a fire straight from the pit of hell.
[02:03:59.935 --> 02:04:07.320]  We cannot fool ourselves into thinking the vast moat of the Atlantic Ocean will protect us from the flames of this fire.
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:14.285]  Instead, we must mobilize the resources to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes.
[02:04:14.285 --> 02:04:21.149]  And there you see the article up from Dr. Kent Brantley, who was a survivor of Ebola.
[02:04:21.149 --> 02:04:22.730]  Quite inflammatory.
[02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:29.395]  And to be clear, in places like Liberia, where this guy who's currently being treated in Dallas with Ebola, where he came from,
[02:04:30.135 --> 02:04:34.298]  In that country, in Sierra Leone, they are not showing any signs of getting this under containment.
[02:04:34.298 --> 02:04:35.178]  It is still spreading.
[02:04:35.178 --> 02:04:38.400]  They have had some success in Nigeria, but not in those countries.
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:40.562]  It is still expanding.
[02:04:40.562 --> 02:04:48.647]  We'll be back after the break with Gerald Salente, switching gears into the Middle East, geopolitics, and the latest financial situation.
[02:04:48.647 --> 02:04:51.328]  Gerald Salente, Trends Research Journal.
[02:04:51.328 --> 02:04:53.349]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:04:53.349 --> 02:04:55.191]  Stay tuned, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:00.188 --> 02:05:03.831]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.831 --> 02:05:08.115]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:08.115 --> 02:05:09.896]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:09.896 --> 02:05:17.763]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:17.763 --> 02:05:18.904]  But for how long?

[02:05:29.758 --> 02:05:30.819]  DNA Force.
[02:05:30.819 --> 02:05:34.102]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:34.102 --> 02:05:35.262]  DNA Force.
[02:05:35.262 --> 02:05:43.409]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:43.409 --> 02:05:48.513]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:05:48.513 --> 02:05:49.534]  DNA Force.
[02:05:49.534 --> 02:05:51.536]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:06:59.723 --> 02:07:06.867]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:06.867 --> 02:07:09.228]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:09.228 --> 02:07:14.511]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:14.511 --> 02:07:19.454]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:19.654 --> 02:07:22.995]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:22.995 --> 02:07:27.036]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:27.036 --> 02:07:31.377]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:41.600]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.121]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:07:44.321 --> 02:07:44.361]  Ah!
[02:08:11.021 --> 02:08:15.849]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:08:15.849 --> 02:08:17.532]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:08:17.532 --> 02:08:19.215]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:19.215 --> 02:08:23.883]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.683 --> 02:08:31.163]  We're back.
[02:08:31.163 --> 02:08:33.063]  It's the Alex Jones Show live third hour.
[02:08:33.063 --> 02:08:34.604]  Gerald Salente coming up.
[02:08:34.604 --> 02:08:36.244]  A few plugs now.
[02:08:36.244 --> 02:08:45.566]  Obviously, I arrived a few days ago with man flu and jet lag, so I could do with a few of these products to support the healthy immune system.
[02:08:45.566 --> 02:08:48.986]  Silver Bullet, and these are all available at infowarsstore.com.
[02:08:48.986 --> 02:08:56.208]  Silver Bullet, triple the strength of others, supports strong immune system, and at the moment it's in limited supply.
[02:08:56.208 --> 02:08:56.468]  Also,
[02:08:57.268 --> 02:09:09.014]  DNA Force focuses on cellular health, superior antioxidant, shielding for cells for skin and body, and of course lung cleanse, which supports respiratory health.
[02:09:09.014 --> 02:09:11.536]  So, get your hands on those three products.
[02:09:11.536 --> 02:09:14.177]  Silver Bullet is in limited supply.
[02:09:14.177 --> 02:09:24.422]  Heavily concentrated in pure de-ionized water, and I definitely need to get my hands on some of these today to try and beat this flu, but I've got Redcoat Power.
[02:09:25.783 --> 02:09:27.524]  I'll be alright for the moment.
[02:09:27.524 --> 02:09:34.947]  Silver Bullet, DNA Force, Lung Cleanse, all available at InfoWarsStore.com and of course it supports the broadcast.
[02:09:34.947 --> 02:09:38.109]  It enables us to continue to do what we do.
[02:09:38.109 --> 02:09:39.949]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:09:39.949 --> 02:09:45.272]  Now we're going to switch to Gerald Salente, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:09:45.272 --> 02:09:48.033]  Of course Gerald needs no introduction.
[02:09:48.033 --> 02:09:53.215]  He's been on the show many times before and we're going to talk to him today about a number of different issues.
[02:09:53.215 --> 02:09:54.336]  Gerald, welcome to the show.
[02:09:54.977 --> 02:09:56.278]  Well, thanks for having me.
[02:09:56.278 --> 02:10:01.021]  I just want to mention, Paul, that I really appreciate your work.
[02:10:01.021 --> 02:10:10.726]  I admire what you write, and I follow you daily on InfoWars.com when your postings are up there, along with the others.
[02:10:10.726 --> 02:10:13.248]  So, I just want to let you know how much I admire your work.
[02:10:14.070 --> 02:10:15.691]  Appreciate that, Gerald.
[02:10:15.691 --> 02:10:18.072]  I'm a big fan of the Trends Research Journal.
[02:10:18.072 --> 02:10:23.854]  Obviously, you've been so accurate in many of your predictions, not just over the last few years, but literally going back decades.
[02:10:23.854 --> 02:10:25.655]  We're going to list some of those later.
[02:10:25.655 --> 02:10:32.058]  But one of your most recent topics was, of course, Syria following fools blindly into war again and again.
[02:10:32.058 --> 02:10:33.559]  You know, last year we had huge
[02:10:34.299 --> 02:10:41.066]  Opposition to a potential intervention in Syria back after the chemical weapons attack in 2013.
[02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:46.191]  Now with ISIS on the table, the opinion polls seem to suggest that Americans have shifted.
[02:10:46.191 --> 02:10:52.197]  Now most of them support the attack on Syria in the name of defeating ISIS.
[02:10:52.197 --> 02:10:55.380]  What do you think is the explanation behind that shift in public opinion?
[02:10:56.462 --> 02:10:59.303]  Well, propaganda is a good business to get into.
[02:10:59.303 --> 02:11:02.564]  You could do it cheaply and get great results.
[02:11:02.564 --> 02:11:09.806]  Let's go back and tracking trends is an understanding of where we are, how we got here, and where we're going.
[02:11:09.806 --> 02:11:11.167]  So how did we get here?
[02:11:11.167 --> 02:11:13.167]  Well, most recently we got here.
[02:11:13.167 --> 02:11:23.991]  You mentioned that the Obama administration wanted to send bombs away into Syria over a year ago, but because of Putin,
[02:11:24.811 --> 02:11:33.074]  And pushing for Syria to get rid of their chemical weapons, and the United Kingdom's parliament not going along with it.
[02:11:33.074 --> 02:11:38.316]  Congress also not going along with the administration back down.
[02:11:38.316 --> 02:11:40.516]  So now, how did it happen?
[02:11:40.516 --> 02:11:43.077]  All of a sudden, Obama shows up.
[02:11:43.077 --> 02:11:46.618]  We gotta save them Christians on the mountain!
[02:11:46.618 --> 02:11:49.740]  You remember that one, those... and those Yazidis!
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.660]  Everybody knows what a Yazidi is!
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:53.621]  You got one living around the block from you!
[02:11:54.281 --> 02:11:58.304]  And everybody, boy, oh, this isn't, we're not going back into Iraq.
[02:11:58.304 --> 02:12:00.785]  I want to make this perfectly clear.
[02:12:00.785 --> 02:12:04.648]  This is a humanitarian mission, girls and boys.
[02:12:04.648 --> 02:12:06.669]  So you got this set up, right?
[02:12:06.669 --> 02:12:10.231]  Now, all of a sudden, they behead two guys.
[02:12:10.231 --> 02:12:13.213]  Oh, Maroon, hey, you beheaded two guys.
[02:12:13.213 --> 02:12:15.355]  What evil, sick people.
[02:12:15.355 --> 02:12:17.856]  Who would behead two guys?
[02:12:17.856 --> 02:12:18.057]  Now,
[02:12:19.107 --> 02:12:40.219]  How about, what is it, over a million people that the United States and its coalition of the willing have killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the war on terror began and we had to get rid of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda that didn't exist?
[02:12:40.219 --> 02:12:43.981]  You could bomb them, that's cool man, but no beheadings!
[02:12:44.321 --> 02:12:46.782]  What happened over there in Gaza?
[02:12:46.782 --> 02:12:47.662]  Ah, 2100 people.
[02:12:47.662 --> 02:12:49.643]  What's going on over in Ukraine?
[02:12:49.643 --> 02:12:53.064]  Ah, they're only Eastern European Russians.
[02:12:53.064 --> 02:12:57.865]  You could bomb them, kill them, but don't behead anybody.
[02:12:57.865 --> 02:13:01.326]  And everybody bought the beheading baloney.
[02:13:02.266 --> 02:13:05.148]  Oh, yeah, you're really evil when you behead people.
[02:13:05.148 --> 02:13:09.550]  Hey, another drone strike over there in Yemen!
[02:13:09.550 --> 02:13:20.656]  Hey, how many in South Waziristan and North Waziristan from the Nobel Peace Prize winner who is quoted as saying, hey, I'm really good at killing people.
[02:13:20.656 --> 02:13:28.320]  So you could drone, you could bomb, you could napalm, you could Agent Orange, you could deplete uranium.
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:35.626]  White phosphorus, but no beheadings, and everybody bought the beheading baloney.
[02:13:35.626 --> 02:13:37.388]  Go back to your country.
[02:13:37.388 --> 02:13:39.510]  Go back to the end of August.
[02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:43.073]  That little chicken hawk, Cameron, shooting off his mouth.
[02:13:43.073 --> 02:13:45.074]  Oh, now we got a terror alert!
[02:13:45.074 --> 02:13:46.155]  Terror alert!
[02:13:46.155 --> 02:13:49.418]  How about the clown over there in Australia, Abbott?
[02:13:49.418 --> 02:13:51.040]  The other part of Costello?
[02:13:51.620 --> 02:13:54.041]  Oh yeah, terror alert!
[02:13:54.041 --> 02:14:00.765]  800 cops to arrest 15 people, and they only got one up on charges of nothing.
[02:14:00.765 --> 02:14:01.985]  But it works!
[02:14:01.985 --> 02:14:06.928]  You spread fear and hysteria, and that's what they're playing, man.
[02:14:06.928 --> 02:14:20.115]  The fear and hysteria card, and 73% of the American people are buying it, along with a lot of the Brits and the Australians and other so-called Westerners.
[02:14:21.144 --> 02:14:22.625]  I'm talking about beheadings, Gerald.
[02:14:22.625 --> 02:14:35.474]  I mean, Saudi Arabia, they've beheaded more people in the last month alone than ISIS ever had, simply because of their brutal justice system, which has been in place for generations.
[02:14:35.474 --> 02:14:37.516]  And of course, Saudi Arabia, one of the countries that
[02:14:38.036 --> 02:14:48.785]  funded the so-called moderate Syrian rebels who sold weapons to ISIS who defected to ISIS in huge numbers back around six months to a year ago.
[02:14:48.785 --> 02:15:05.938]  Now we're talking about the Obama administration again arming these so-called moderate Syrian rebels even though many of the units there have pledged allegiance not only to al-Qaeda groups like Jabhat al-Nusra but also to ISIS units themselves and given them weapons and actually handed over
[02:15:06.358 --> 02:15:11.703]  Some of the individuals that were allegedly beheaded, the American journalist James Foley.
[02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:24.555]  So, Gerald, how do you feel about the hypocrisy of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar being involved in this so-called war on ISIS when they were responsible for the upspring of ISIS in the region in the first place?
[02:15:24.555 --> 02:15:25.396]  Well, exactly.
[02:15:25.396 --> 02:15:27.738]  That's why I follow your work, by the way.
[02:15:27.738 --> 02:15:30.561]  You put it together very well and you laid out all the facts.
[02:15:31.249 --> 02:15:40.076]  And the other fact is that nobody's talking about in the major media, the mainstream media, is that, hey, who created these conditions?
[02:15:40.076 --> 02:15:42.919]  Who destroyed entire nations?
[02:15:42.919 --> 02:15:45.361]  Who killed millions of people?
[02:15:45.361 --> 02:15:49.684]  Who laid the groundwork for the radicalism?
[02:15:49.684 --> 02:15:55.229]  Now let's take it, anybody out there, yourself, myself, anyone listening, you live in a rock.
[02:15:56.736 --> 02:15:58.497]  Oi, oi.
[02:15:58.497 --> 02:16:00.178]  Neighboring country, like Syria.
[02:16:27.076 --> 02:16:30.198]  So now, fast forwarding to where we are.
[02:16:30.198 --> 02:16:32.960]  Here you live in one of these countries.
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:36.683]  Everybody that you love has been killed.
[02:16:36.683 --> 02:16:38.904]  You have no future.
[02:16:38.904 --> 02:16:47.550]  You didn't have enough money to get out of there, but the people that did, the tens of millions that left, you know, they saw what was coming.
[02:16:47.550 --> 02:16:49.731]  Your whole nation is destroyed.
[02:16:50.712 --> 02:16:53.075]  The place is in ruins.
[02:16:53.075 --> 02:16:57.539]  You think you want to get even for the people that did it for you?
[02:16:58.835 --> 02:17:00.495]  No, man!
[02:17:00.495 --> 02:17:02.476]  You is a radical!
[02:17:02.476 --> 02:17:05.837]  You're a fundamentalist and a terrorist!
[02:17:05.837 --> 02:17:21.200]  Don't you know that it's better for you to listen to the occupiers and the puppets, the corrupt puppets that they put in place to run and ruin your life than to think for yourself and to be on your own?
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:22.801]  So no one's talking about
[02:17:23.601 --> 02:17:29.862]  The war criminals that started these wars based on lies.
[02:17:29.862 --> 02:17:30.663]  B.S.
[02:17:30.663 --> 02:17:44.526]  Blair, Dick Cheney, Bush, Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, all the ones that sold these wars based on lies.
[02:17:46.149 --> 02:17:50.051]  Or maybe they got a better word in that white shoe world.
[02:17:50.051 --> 02:17:51.232]  They misled us.
[02:17:51.232 --> 02:17:53.093]  Isn't that a nice word?
[02:17:53.093 --> 02:18:03.600]  So what I'm saying to you, Paul, they created conditions for this horror and now the same mad men and mad women that got it going...
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:08.582]  We got a new plan, new strategies, we're gonna fix it this time.
[02:18:08.582 --> 02:18:20.728]  They have nothing but track records of failure behind them, and now they're shooting off their mouths every retired general, military strategist, think tank...
[02:18:22.717 --> 02:18:37.622]  Experts are showing up on the news and telling us, here's what we gotta do, we gotta do this, we gotta do that, when all they have is failure and disaster as a track record of credentials.
[02:18:37.622 --> 02:18:47.846]  They're leading us, as we wrote before in the Trends Journal, to the first great war of the 21st century.
[02:18:47.846 --> 02:18:48.926]  It's underway.
[02:18:51.131 --> 02:19:09.069]  You mentioned that, again, the airstrikes flooding the region with weapons, I mean, we have this false dichotomy being imposed on us, you know, Obama is being weak on ISIS, we hear that from Fox News and a lot of the right-wing media, when every single statistical academic study has proven
[02:19:09.730 --> 02:19:17.333]  That flooding the Middle East with weapons and carrying out airstrikes radicalizes the region and creates more terrorists.
[02:19:17.333 --> 02:19:18.994]  This is a known fact.
[02:19:18.994 --> 02:19:25.216]  It's not conjecture, you know, this idea of, oh, we have to be strong, we have to bomb them out of existence.
[02:19:25.216 --> 02:19:25.956]  It doesn't work.
[02:19:25.956 --> 02:19:28.197]  It only ever creates more resentment.
[02:19:28.197 --> 02:19:30.398]  It radicalizes the region, creates more terrorists.
[02:19:30.398 --> 02:19:33.959]  I mean, look at Obama in Libya funding the radical jihadists.
[02:19:33.959 --> 02:19:35.280]  They later went into Syria
[02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:39.643]  Now those secular governments, Gaddafi, Assad, have been destabilized.
[02:19:39.643 --> 02:19:48.189]  We're seeing this radical jihadist militant ideology spread across the region and it's a deliberate result of the airstrikes of flooding the region with weapons.
[02:19:48.189 --> 02:19:51.031]  We'll be back after the break with Gerald Solente.
[02:19:51.031 --> 02:19:53.433]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:19:53.433 --> 02:19:55.034]  Infowars.com.

[02:20:29.648 --> 02:20:32.370]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[02:20:32.370 --> 02:20:33.150]  No joke.
[02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:35.831]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[02:20:35.831 --> 02:20:38.433]  And if House Bill H.R.
[02:20:38.433 --> 02:20:42.935]  5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[02:20:42.935 --> 02:20:45.757]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.
[02:20:45.757 --> 02:20:48.238]  Go now to InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[02:20:56.262 --> 02:20:57.703]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:20:57.703 --> 02:20:58.824]  Just won't quit.
[02:20:59.224 --> 02:21:02.126]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[02:21:02.126 --> 02:21:05.668]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:21:05.668 --> 02:21:07.830]  And in a word, the answer is protection.

[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:02.402]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:02.402 --> 02:22:05.745]  In no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[02:22:05.745 --> 02:22:08.488]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[02:22:08.488 --> 02:22:12.431]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:22:12.431 --> 02:22:16.195]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:22:16.195 --> 02:22:17.616]  Ours is not immune.
[02:22:17.616 --> 02:22:19.257]  The time is now to be proactive.
[02:22:19.257 --> 02:22:19.838]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:22:24.582 --> 02:22:27.284]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[02:22:27.284 --> 02:22:32.888]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it, so decide.
[02:22:32.888 --> 02:22:36.230]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?

[02:22:39.752 --> 02:22:40.753]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[02:22:40.753 --> 02:22:40.933]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[02:22:54.825 --> 02:22:55.370]  Extension 116.

[02:24:19.102 --> 02:24:20.443]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:24:20.443 --> 02:24:22.905]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:24:22.905 --> 02:24:26.628]  I'm joined by Gerald Talente, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:24:26.628 --> 02:24:29.971]  We're going to take a few of your calls for Gerald at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:29.971 --> 02:24:32.493]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:32.493 --> 02:24:43.103]  We've got Gerald's website up here, Trends Research Institute, and if you click on the left-hand side there, Gerald's forecasts, and scroll down the page,
[02:24:43.683 --> 02:24:51.647]  You will see a list, a number of different events, developments over the past 20 or so years that Gerald has accurately predicted.
[02:24:51.647 --> 02:24:55.829]  Of course he's known for predicting the panic of 08, the financial meltdown.
[02:24:55.829 --> 02:25:01.712]  But also the stock market crash 1987, the gold bull run which began in December 2001.
[02:25:02.873 --> 02:25:10.923]  And what's interesting is he has links to the Trends Journal next to each of these predictions where he accurately made the forecast.
[02:25:10.923 --> 02:25:22.237]  And it's not just, you know, wider events like the financial collapse, it's smaller cultural type of things which I always find interesting, like the clean food revolution if you keep scrolling down there.
[02:25:22.877 --> 02:25:26.499]  The decline of US automakers, even things like gourmet coffee.
[02:25:26.499 --> 02:25:32.983]  As far back as 1988, Gerald was talking about the rise in interest in that sort of thing.
[02:25:32.983 --> 02:25:36.826]  Too big to fail trend, the ghost mauling of America.
[02:25:36.826 --> 02:25:45.991]  Just a number of different events and little developments both in culture and health, in food, basically anything you want to think about there.
[02:25:45.991 --> 02:25:49.694]  Secessionist movements, we now see that rising again across Europe.
[02:25:49.694 --> 02:25:51.035]  So Gerald, I mean basically,
[02:25:52.065 --> 02:25:53.988]  You've got this down to a fine art.
[02:25:53.988 --> 02:25:55.550]  I mean, what's the secret?
[02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:56.211]  How do you do it?
[02:25:56.211 --> 02:26:00.478]  Is it just looking back at history and transposing that onto current events?
[02:26:00.478 --> 02:26:03.463]  How do you make all these forecasts and get it right so often?
[02:26:04.827 --> 02:26:05.287]  Thank you.
[02:26:05.287 --> 02:26:15.990]  Current events form future trends, but people look at them in a sense of, this is what I believe, this is what I want, this is what I think.
[02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:18.390]  And we look at them as just facts.
[02:26:18.390 --> 02:26:20.951]  We try to get as many facts as we can.
[02:26:20.951 --> 02:26:29.773]  So for example, each day I'll read from Fars News Agency in Iran, to Al Jazeera, to Haaretz, the Israeli, Jerusalem Post.
[02:26:30.353 --> 02:26:36.955]  To the BBC, Guardian, Blacklisted News, on and on and on.
[02:26:36.955 --> 02:26:39.055]  All I'm doing is looking for facts.
[02:26:39.055 --> 02:26:40.135]  Are they real facts?
[02:26:40.135 --> 02:26:41.116]  I don't know.
[02:26:41.116 --> 02:26:44.276]  But you put enough together and you can get the sense.
[02:26:44.276 --> 02:26:51.418]  So what happens again, Paul, is that when you go to a doctor or you listen to a scientist, all you want are the facts.
[02:26:51.418 --> 02:26:55.119]  You don't care what their belief systems are, what their gender creed is.
[02:26:55.939 --> 02:27:02.743]  So, when you're looking, you mentioned before about Fox, too many people out there have an agenda.
[02:27:02.743 --> 02:27:07.225]  So what they're doing is they're skewing the information to fit their belief system.
[02:27:07.225 --> 02:27:09.646]  We're looking at it for what it is.
[02:27:09.646 --> 02:27:15.589]  So, for example, people are now following Barack Obama again to war.
[02:27:15.589 --> 02:27:17.930]  Again, the numbers are there.
[02:27:17.930 --> 02:27:22.713]  73% support the bombing of a sovereign nation called Syria.
[02:27:22.713 --> 02:27:22.993]  Okay.
[02:27:23.593 --> 02:27:26.417]  Now, what's Obama's track record?
[02:27:26.417 --> 02:27:35.809]  Well, he has six years of nothing but broken promises, a string of failures, and a real bad attitude.
[02:27:35.809 --> 02:27:39.193]  So why would I believe anything else that he's going to do?
[02:27:39.193 --> 02:27:41.516]  Yet they do, and they'll defend him.
[02:27:42.688 --> 02:27:47.211]  So, what happens is, when you look around the world, the same things happen.
[02:27:47.211 --> 02:27:56.576]  In a time of crisis, and they made up the story of, hey, we gotta watch the ISIS everywhere, the fear and hysteria sells real well.
[02:27:56.576 --> 02:27:58.357]  So I'm going to give you a forecast.
[02:27:59.918 --> 02:28:08.464]  Not only has the first great war of the 21st century occurred, get ready for a terrorist strike, or that's what they're going to call it.
[02:28:08.464 --> 02:28:12.647]  You could call it, as we used to say in the Bronx, payback's a bitch.
[02:28:12.647 --> 02:28:21.393]  It's going to be reprisal strikes for what the United States and its allies are doing in the slaughter of millions of innocent people.
[02:28:21.393 --> 02:28:28.718]  The facts show 90% of wars, I believe since World War I, 90% of the casualties are civilians.
[02:28:29.398 --> 02:28:33.159]  So, will it be false flag or real?
[02:28:33.159 --> 02:28:34.700]  It's incidental.
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:36.580]  It'll be an excuse.
[02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:40.441]  It'll be an excuse to rob us of more of our rights.
[02:28:40.441 --> 02:28:41.942]  You're hearing it already.
[02:28:41.942 --> 02:28:46.723]  It's more of an excuse for the militarization of the police force.
[02:28:46.723 --> 02:28:53.385]  It's more of an excuse for fascism, the merger of state and corporate powers that take over our lives.
[02:28:54.005 --> 02:29:10.075]  How could any sensible human being believe what's coming out of the mouth of the congressmen and these politicians around the world saying that they're going to put in plans to stop them terrorists from striking the homeland?
[02:29:10.075 --> 02:29:11.275]  Let me get this straight.
[02:29:12.316 --> 02:29:17.098]  You can't stop a guy from jumping over the White House fence.
[02:29:17.098 --> 02:29:23.100]  You can't stop a guy from running inside and running through the joint.
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:33.443]  You can't stop millions of illegals coming over the border, including tens of thousands of little kids unescorted.
[02:29:33.443 --> 02:29:38.745]  But now you're going to rob me of my money and rob me of my rights under the line?
[02:29:39.705 --> 02:29:42.147]  That you're gonna protect us from terrorists?
[02:29:42.147 --> 02:29:45.670]  Okay, more from Gerald Flante coming up after the break.
[02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:46.991]  Stay there, your call's coming up.
[02:29:46.991 --> 02:29:49.353]  This is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:49.353 --> 02:29:52.356]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.356 --> 02:29:55.939]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.327 --> 02:30:01.587]  Another major health threat.
[02:30:01.587 --> 02:30:06.569]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:30:06.569 --> 02:30:09.250]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:30:09.250 --> 02:30:16.272]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:30:16.272 --> 02:30:19.253]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:30:19.253 --> 02:30:22.294]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:30:22.294 --> 02:30:24.235]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:30:24.235 --> 02:30:27.076]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:30:27.176 --> 02:30:32.898]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:30:32.898 --> 02:30:36.399]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:30:36.399 --> 02:30:39.500]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:46.822]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:30:46.822 --> 02:30:50.043]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:31:00.468 --> 02:31:10.116]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:31:10.116 --> 02:31:15.981]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life.
[02:31:16.181 --> 02:31:20.042]  Was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:31:20.042 --> 02:31:26.225]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[02:31:26.225 --> 02:31:30.406]  Oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:31:30.406 --> 02:31:35.068]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[02:31:35.068 --> 02:31:37.309]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[02:31:37.509 --> 02:31:40.070]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:45.732]  Instead, OxyPowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:31:45.732 --> 02:31:51.073]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[02:32:00.476 --> 02:32:06.601]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:32:06.601 --> 02:32:09.904]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:32:09.904 --> 02:32:11.706]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[02:32:11.706 --> 02:32:18.051]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:32:18.051 --> 02:32:23.956]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down our pants on the streets?
[02:32:24.076 --> 02:32:28.038]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:30.960]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:39.405]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:32:39.405 --> 02:32:41.486]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:32:41.486 --> 02:32:42.547]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:32:42.907 --> 02:32:51.855]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:33:04.176 --> 02:33:06.038]  We are on the march.
[02:33:06.038 --> 02:33:09.200]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:12.904]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:22.927 --> 02:33:29.493]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show, I'm Paul Joseph Watson, filling in for Alex today with all the breaking Ebola news.
[02:33:29.493 --> 02:33:32.775]  You can visit InfoWars.com, we're right on top of that.
[02:33:32.775 --> 02:33:37.139]  But for the moment we're talking with Gerald Salente, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:33:37.139 --> 02:33:41.623]  And if you missed it before the break, Gerald made a pretty big forecast.
[02:33:41.623 --> 02:33:50.670]  He's saying that as a result of the attacks in the Middle East, supposedly targeting ISIS, there will be, whether it's a false flag or an organic
[02:33:51.431 --> 02:33:52.832]  Genuine attack.
[02:33:52.832 --> 02:33:57.997]  There will be a terror attack within the US here coming up in the imminent future.
[02:33:57.997 --> 02:34:12.910]  And as I said, you know, every single university study proves that bombing the Middle East, radicalizing jihadists, flooding the region with weapons only ever causes blowback, only ever causes more violence.
[02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:16.133]  Gerald, just before we go to Coles, finishing off your point on that.
[02:34:18.123 --> 02:34:25.771]  Yes, you know, we have to really go back to the beginning, not the beginning, the beginning, but this latest round.
[02:34:25.771 --> 02:34:36.822]  And that really happened after World War I, when a bunch of colonial powers led by the United Kingdom and France carved a joint up from the Ottoman Empire.
[02:34:36.822 --> 02:34:37.823]  I mean, look at the map.
[02:34:38.243 --> 02:34:45.009]  The Sykes-Picot lines, these straight lines, making up these countries that never existed before.
[02:34:45.009 --> 02:34:47.871]  And the colonization that's continued.
[02:34:47.871 --> 02:34:53.436]  So there's no end in sight as long as the colonial powers continue their imperialism.
[02:34:54.549 --> 02:35:05.137]  I just want to shift gears here for just a moment, because as we're on the air, there's a lot of destabilization going on in the equity markets.
[02:35:05.137 --> 02:35:09.821]  The Dow is down about 220 points.
[02:35:09.821 --> 02:35:18.988]  Crude oil, after being up over a buck, both West Texas and Brent, is down now in negative territory.
[02:35:18.988 --> 02:35:21.130]  And it's very significant.
[02:35:21.130 --> 02:35:23.912]  And gold prices are moving back up a little bit.
[02:35:24.838 --> 02:35:31.044]  I'm saying this because oil prices are a real big one to look at.
[02:35:31.044 --> 02:35:38.692]  I've been at this since, you know, I began my career, I was a lobbyist, a government affairs specialist for the chemical industry.
[02:35:38.692 --> 02:35:44.317]  I was in DC during the 1973 oil embargo.
[02:35:44.317 --> 02:35:48.761]  This is the first time since that time that Saudi Arabia
[02:35:49.710 --> 02:35:56.731]  Has pushed and has been successful in cutting oil production.
[02:35:56.731 --> 02:35:58.752]  It's not because there's an oversupply.
[02:35:58.752 --> 02:36:04.533]  On the contrary, if you look at today's numbers with West Texas, supplies are way down.
[02:36:04.533 --> 02:36:07.273]  Demand is way off.
[02:36:07.273 --> 02:36:13.914]  And when you look at the World Energy Institute and other data, you can see that demand is now down.
[02:36:13.914 --> 02:36:17.055]  It's about down to two year lows.
[02:36:17.055 --> 02:36:18.395]  And so is the pricing.
[02:36:19.338 --> 02:36:24.743]  So this is really significant because oil is telling a true story right now.
[02:36:24.743 --> 02:36:43.542]  With all of this political unrest in the Middle East, as you mentioned, the destabilization caused by that so-called humanitarian mission launched by President Obama, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, and his staff of associates, Samantha Powers, Susan Rice, and Hillary Clinton,
[02:36:45.034 --> 02:36:49.675]  And the production levels have dropped so dramatically there and in Iraq.
[02:36:49.675 --> 02:36:54.156]  Oil prices should go up as this destabilization increases.
[02:36:54.156 --> 02:36:55.276]  They're not.
[02:36:55.276 --> 02:37:00.697]  That's showing you the fundamental weaknesses of the global economy.
[02:37:00.697 --> 02:37:08.499]  And this just out recently from the... I'll put my glasses on here a second.
[02:37:10.649 --> 02:37:31.343]  Record level of $158 trillion in global debt, together with low economic growth, is creating serious threat of a new financial crisis, says the 16th Annual Geneva Report.
[02:37:31.343 --> 02:37:37.547]  Total world debt, excluding the financial sector, are you ready for this?
[02:37:37.547 --> 02:37:38.568]  Has risen from 180%
[02:37:41.029 --> 02:37:50.392]  Of global output in 2008 to 2012 percent last year.
[02:37:50.392 --> 02:37:55.154]  There's no way of getting out of this financial crisis.
[02:37:55.154 --> 02:37:57.074]  You know how you get out of it?
[02:37:57.074 --> 02:38:00.835]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:38:00.835 --> 02:38:02.516]  All things are connected.
[02:38:02.516 --> 02:38:05.137]  You asked me before about how we forecast trends.
[02:38:05.737 --> 02:38:08.198]  We make connections between different fields.
[02:38:08.198 --> 02:38:18.001]  You read over some of the list from my coining the term clean food back in 1993 to talking about geopolitics and finance.
[02:38:18.001 --> 02:38:19.982]  It's all connected.
[02:38:19.982 --> 02:38:21.642]  But most people don't connect them.
[02:38:21.642 --> 02:38:23.963]  They only look at specific fields.
[02:38:23.963 --> 02:38:27.384]  So when we're looking at the Middle East, we're looking at oil prices.
[02:38:27.904 --> 02:38:32.507]  We're looking at GDP data coming out, debt levels increasing.
[02:38:32.507 --> 02:38:38.010]  You look at today's manufacturing indexes coming out of Germany and Europe.
[02:38:38.010 --> 02:38:42.052]  They're down now into negative territory, under 50%.
[02:38:42.052 --> 02:38:48.415]  So, you can see where this is leading, and you can see where the leaders are leading us.
[02:38:48.415 --> 02:38:56.340]  The same people that have led us through nothing but a series of great financial and military disasters,
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:39:04.446]  Are in control and leading us down the path of more doom and decline.
[02:39:04.446 --> 02:39:08.870]  We're talking the Middle East, oil, debt, with Gerald Solente.
[02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:10.371]  We're going to go to some calls now.
[02:39:10.371 --> 02:39:13.354]  James in Illinois, you're on the air with Gerald Solente.
[02:39:13.354 --> 02:39:17.137]  Go ahead, James.
[02:39:17.137 --> 02:39:19.099]  Gerald, are you there?
[02:39:19.099 --> 02:39:20.480]  I'm here.
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:22.001]  Yeah, great show.
[02:39:22.001 --> 02:39:23.142]  I got a quick question.
[02:39:23.829 --> 02:39:25.530]  I just sold my house.
[02:39:25.530 --> 02:39:28.171]  I got about $120,000.
[02:39:28.171 --> 02:39:33.052]  I got two and a half years to go before I can start pulling my pension.
[02:39:33.052 --> 02:39:34.193]  I want to move to the South.
[02:39:34.193 --> 02:39:35.373]  Where do I put my money?
[02:39:35.373 --> 02:39:39.975]  If I put it in gold or in silver, that's my question.
[02:39:39.975 --> 02:39:41.495]  Is that a good place for it?
[02:39:41.495 --> 02:39:45.376]  And where can I... Let me see.
[02:39:45.376 --> 02:39:51.738]  How can I do that through a reputable dealer that doesn't attach me to the government?
[02:39:51.738 --> 02:39:52.319]  No strings.
[02:39:52.319 --> 02:39:53.079]  That's my question.
[02:39:54.113 --> 02:39:57.214]  Yeah, you know, I wish I could answer that question for you.
[02:39:57.214 --> 02:39:57.894]  I can't.
[02:39:57.894 --> 02:40:02.916]  I'm not a financial analyst, and I don't have... I'm not licensed.
[02:40:02.916 --> 02:40:07.518]  So if I said anything to you, they would come clamping down on me.
[02:40:07.518 --> 02:40:15.401]  And you know the motto of the Trends Journal, taught to me by my dear father, may his soul rest in peace, anytime I'd be saying something, he'd say, think for yourself.
[02:40:16.081 --> 02:40:18.123]  And that's where I would leave it with you.
[02:40:18.123 --> 02:40:19.524]  Think for yourself.
[02:40:19.524 --> 02:40:22.728]  Real estate doesn't necessarily have to be a bad deal.
[02:40:22.728 --> 02:40:26.952]  You know, it depends what you're buying and what your plans are to do with it.
[02:40:26.952 --> 02:40:31.576]  If it's a speculative deal, I would say that's not for me.
[02:40:31.576 --> 02:40:32.777]  Gold?
[02:40:32.777 --> 02:40:35.320]  I'll tell you where I'm going with gold.
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:38.002]  And I'm, by the way, I'm only invested in gold
[02:40:39.043 --> 02:40:44.205]  Major and real estate, but I buy, I buy historic buildings.
[02:40:44.205 --> 02:40:48.607]  I have a 1750, a 1774, and a 1763.
[02:40:48.607 --> 02:40:55.530]  Plus the building we're in here, the Mohegan Market, which is a beautiful old, you know, hundred-year-old building.
[02:40:55.530 --> 02:40:59.891]  And, but I buy, and I believe in gold prices.
[02:40:59.891 --> 02:41:02.813]  But here's what I think is going to happen.
[02:41:02.813 --> 02:41:05.874]  I believe that they're going to have to raise interest rates.
[02:41:07.372 --> 02:41:19.997]  The economy cannot sustain itself with interest rates going up, because that's the only thing that's propping up the housing market, which is now softening again, and the equity markets, which are now softening again.
[02:41:19.997 --> 02:41:23.138]  When they raise interest rates, there'll be panic on the street.
[02:41:23.138 --> 02:41:24.759]  Back to gold.
[02:41:24.759 --> 02:41:26.579]  I believe the downside gold is $11.50.
[02:41:29.969 --> 02:41:35.735]  Around there, but the upside potential is well over 2000.
[02:41:35.735 --> 02:41:39.719]  So for me, I'm in gold for my golden years.
[02:41:39.719 --> 02:41:41.461]  I used to trade it as a young guy.
[02:41:41.461 --> 02:41:44.945]  My first buy was in 19 late 1970s at 100 and 187 dollars and 50 cents an ounce.
[02:41:49.497 --> 02:41:55.160]  So to me, when you invest in these things, again, I invest in real estate with my heart.
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:56.360]  I'm not, you know, I'm not stupid.
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:58.681]  I'm not going to doing it to lose money.
[02:41:58.681 --> 02:42:06.305]  But if I don't make a lot of money on it, it's OK, because I know I have a valuable asset in buying historic buildings and gold.
[02:42:06.305 --> 02:42:14.429]  As I said, I'm in it long term and I believe in it because why would I want paper that's been devalued over 90 percent in 100 years?
[02:42:18.035 --> 02:42:19.376]  Thanks for the call, James.
[02:42:19.376 --> 02:42:21.678]  Jim in Illinois, you're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[02:42:21.678 --> 02:42:22.399]  Go ahead, Jim.
[02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:25.381]  Hi, how are you doing today?
[02:42:25.381 --> 02:42:27.563]  Good.
[02:42:27.563 --> 02:42:29.004]  I've got a question for you.
[02:42:29.004 --> 02:42:37.612]  Alex Jones has scared myself and probably half the nation as far as these globalists are concerned, the fear they put into all of us.
[02:42:37.612 --> 02:42:43.597]  I have a suggestion to stop these people, and it can be done.
[02:42:43.597 --> 02:42:46.179]  With the help of him, if he puts out a website,
[02:42:47.225 --> 02:42:58.696]  Uh, with their names, phone numbers, and addresses on it, and I guarantee in six months the people of America will make it very uncomfortable for these people to even exist and try and do harm to America.
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:01.261]  Okay, thanks.
[02:43:01.261 --> 02:43:02.082]  Go ahead, Gerald.
[02:43:02.082 --> 02:43:03.984]  They're in front of you already!
[02:43:03.984 --> 02:43:13.294]  I mean, they call the President, the Congress... I mean, what self-respecting adult would believe any of them?
[02:43:13.294 --> 02:43:15.737]  Oh, you like Lindsey Graham?
[02:43:15.737 --> 02:43:18.800]  You get it really nice with McCain?
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:21.023]  You think Pelosi got a brain?
[02:43:21.483 --> 02:43:23.926]  How about not so Feinstein?
[02:43:23.926 --> 02:43:31.896]  There's nothing behind the curtain but a decrepit old man pulling the levers.
[02:43:31.896 --> 02:43:34.119]  It's what you see.
[02:43:34.119 --> 02:43:37.163]  And by the way, we're doing something to change it.
[02:43:37.163 --> 02:43:38.224]  On May 2nd of 2015,
[02:43:40.427 --> 02:43:55.825]  From the most historic corner in the United States, the only place where there's a pre-revolutionary war stone building, we have permission to close down the cross streets, and we're setting up our movement, OccupyPeace.us.
[02:43:57.347 --> 02:43:59.189]  You can go to the website.
[02:43:59.189 --> 02:44:02.031]  No foreign entanglements.
[02:44:02.031 --> 02:44:08.856]  This is the foundation upon which the Constitution was founded, right in this area.
[02:44:08.856 --> 02:44:16.222]  Every one of the founding fathers, beginning with Washington, a real commander-in-chief, a guy that fought.
[02:44:17.063 --> 02:44:21.505]  Not these little chicken hawks that can't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[02:44:21.505 --> 02:44:25.186]  No foreign entanglements in his farewell address.
[02:44:25.186 --> 02:44:26.167]  Madison.
[02:44:26.167 --> 02:44:27.567]  Jefferson.
[02:44:27.567 --> 02:44:28.848]  Every one of them.
[02:44:28.848 --> 02:44:29.808]  Franklin.
[02:44:29.808 --> 02:44:31.689]  So we're doing something.
[02:44:31.689 --> 02:44:39.932]  We believe that America can return to the greatness that it was that made it the land of opportunity.
[02:44:40.592 --> 02:44:43.219]  No Foreign Entanglements Rebuild America.
[02:44:43.219 --> 02:44:44.863]  I have a story for you.
[02:44:44.863 --> 02:44:47.269]  Right out of today's Wall Street Journal.
[02:44:47.269 --> 02:44:47.730]  Here it is.
[02:44:49.775 --> 02:44:53.457]  Fighting Islamic State strains the budget.
[02:44:53.457 --> 02:45:02.420]  Congress and the President are under pressure to bolster Pentagon coffers to fund expanding efforts in the Middle East.
[02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:11.084]  And you heard by our Commander-in-Chief, if you listen to his UN speech, which we broke down, we may be there
[02:45:12.278 --> 02:45:23.041]  For another 10 years or more, unending war, one after another, and then you pick up the news, and what do you see?
[02:45:23.041 --> 02:45:31.143]  Over there in Detroit, federal judge rules Detroit residents have no fundamental right to water.
[02:45:31.863 --> 02:45:33.164]  You got it!
[02:45:33.164 --> 02:45:41.889]  We have all this money to fight and kill other people, but can't pay your water bill to hell with you.
[02:45:41.889 --> 02:45:52.774]  And by the way, as I look at it, again, only speaking for myself, anyone that supports war, these kinds of war, are supporting murder.
[02:45:52.774 --> 02:45:54.555]  And I'm not a pacifist.
[02:45:54.555 --> 02:45:56.777]  I'm a close combat practitioner.
[02:45:56.777 --> 02:45:58.598]  Had my own school for many years.
[02:45:59.418 --> 02:46:05.982]  I believe in self-defense, but I don't believe in murdering innocent people.
[02:46:05.982 --> 02:46:07.263]  And here you have it.
[02:46:07.263 --> 02:46:28.315]  They're calling for more of our money that Eisenhower warned us against, the military-industrial complex, from stealing it, as the nation's infrastructure rots, and this judge could give a flying anything about people that are too poor to pay for their water.
[02:46:28.695 --> 02:46:33.297]  Hey, Obama, where's your humanitarian mission?
[02:46:33.297 --> 02:46:39.379]  Motown is no town, but we gotta save them Yazidis on the mountain.
[02:46:39.379 --> 02:46:44.101]  But, hey, Gerald, I mean, Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, they're all doing really well.
[02:46:44.101 --> 02:46:45.302]  Their stocks are through the roof.
[02:46:45.302 --> 02:46:47.382]  I mean, who cares about people in Detroit?
[02:46:47.382 --> 02:46:48.483]  They've got no free water.
[02:46:48.483 --> 02:46:53.685]  The military-industrial complex is really making good out of this new war on ISIS, isn't it?
[02:46:54.631 --> 02:46:55.632]  It's doing great!
[02:46:55.632 --> 02:47:02.135]  And that's why people say, you know, Mr. Solange, you point out the problems, but you don't give the solutions.
[02:47:02.135 --> 02:47:03.315]  Not true.
[02:47:03.315 --> 02:47:06.076]  You look at the Trends Journal, it's full of solutions.
[02:47:06.076 --> 02:47:08.798]  And the big solution is occupied peace.
[02:47:08.798 --> 02:47:10.479]  And I want to make this clear.
[02:47:10.479 --> 02:47:17.142]  This isn't going to be one of these rallies where everybody comes, yells, and screams, and goes away, what do I do next?
[02:47:18.061 --> 02:47:20.322]  We're going to have takeaways.
[02:47:20.322 --> 02:47:22.984]  We're going to have action plans.
[02:47:22.984 --> 02:47:26.806]  And we have ours, but we want to hear yours as well.
[02:47:26.806 --> 02:47:32.549]  Again, OccupyPeace.us, we're launching a major movement.
[02:47:32.549 --> 02:47:36.792]  It's going to be officially launched from Colonial Kingston.
[02:47:36.792 --> 02:47:43.856]  By the way, right across the street from me is the Kingston Courthouse.
[02:47:43.856 --> 02:47:45.777]  John Jay was a jury here.
[02:47:47.170 --> 02:47:50.135]  Four Supreme Court Justices!
[02:47:50.135 --> 02:47:57.086]  The Constitution of New York State, the first capital of New York State, before the British burnt the joint down, was written here.
[02:47:57.086 --> 02:47:58.808]  The important part of this, Paul?
[02:48:01.121 --> 02:48:12.733]  90% of the United States Constitution comes from the New York State Constitution written here by our founding fathers.
[02:48:12.733 --> 02:48:17.518]  I want a revolution, the second American revolution.
[02:48:18.018 --> 02:48:24.880]  One of peace, one of prosperity, one of morality, and one of spirituality.
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:29.502]  And I'm not talking about that New Age stuff or any religion.
[02:48:29.502 --> 02:48:31.862]  I'm talking about the spirit of the soul.
[02:48:31.862 --> 02:48:33.943]  The spirit of human dignity.
[02:48:33.943 --> 02:48:38.084]  The spirit of courage in a country that's turned coward.
[02:48:38.084 --> 02:48:44.006]  Because only cowards would listen to the clowns that are leading them to disaster.
[02:48:44.006 --> 02:48:46.347]  What self-respecting human being
[02:48:46.767 --> 02:48:52.016]  Hey fellas, I really appreciate you being in America, Paul and David.
[02:49:00.206 --> 02:49:01.507]  Certainly appreciate you as well.
[02:49:01.507 --> 02:49:05.510]  I wanted to say, Mr. Salente, I'm a huge fan of what you do.
[02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:06.670]  I'm an avid reader.
[02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:18.798]  I wanted to ask you if you could, down the road, perhaps you could identify a little more clearly what the IBS actually stands for and what their power control really means in terms of the world order.
[02:49:18.798 --> 02:49:20.699]  And that's kind of really what I wanted to say.
[02:49:20.699 --> 02:49:23.961]  I didn't want to derail the conversation much, but you guys are doing a great job.
[02:49:23.961 --> 02:49:24.842]  Thank you very much.
[02:49:24.842 --> 02:49:25.983]  I enjoyed it entirely.
[02:49:26.874 --> 02:49:28.795]  Gerald, just a minute on that one before the break.
[02:49:28.795 --> 02:49:29.135]  Go ahead.
[02:49:29.135 --> 02:49:31.436]  Yeah, it's very clear.
[02:49:31.436 --> 02:49:33.837]  You were talking about the military-industrial complex.
[02:49:33.837 --> 02:49:35.957]  It's a multinational takeover.
[02:49:35.957 --> 02:49:37.758]  How much more proof do you need?
[02:49:37.758 --> 02:49:40.379]  How many more Walmarts do you need to be built?
[02:49:40.379 --> 02:49:42.500]  How many more Home Depots?
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:45.701]  All the people that used to have hardware stores out of business do you need?
[02:49:46.081 --> 02:49:50.444]  How many more staples that took the lives out of people that own stationary stores?
[02:49:50.444 --> 02:49:52.846]  It's Slavelandia worldwide.
[02:49:52.846 --> 02:49:55.148]  It's a multinational takeover.
[02:49:55.148 --> 02:50:09.318]  You got the neocon mad men and women, a handful as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who by the way, there is no one I respect more for geopolitical insights and economic knowledge than he.
[02:50:09.318 --> 02:50:11.520]  And he just did a piece breaking it down.
[02:50:12.020 --> 02:50:22.443]  A handful of madmen neocons and women and he went back to the Dulles brothers under Eisenhower in the other years that have destroyed this nation.
[02:50:22.443 --> 02:50:25.263]  It's a multinational takeover.
[02:50:25.263 --> 02:50:27.904]  Return the nations to the people.
[02:50:27.904 --> 02:50:31.565]  It's the populist movement that the multinationals fear the most.
[02:50:32.145 --> 02:50:38.089]  And we'll pick up on that populist movement after the break with Gerald Solente, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:50:38.089 --> 02:50:41.812]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show live coming up.
[02:50:41.812 --> 02:50:42.792]  We're done for the calls now.
[02:50:42.792 --> 02:50:48.917]  We're going to get into the CFR, the populist uprising and their attempts to co-opt that on the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:50:48.917 --> 02:50:50.878]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:50.878 --> 02:50:52.819]  Keep it right there for the final segment.
[02:50:52.819 --> 02:50:53.400]  Stay tuned.
[02:51:00.603 --> 02:51:04.944]  Are you happy doing your laundry with perfume detergents that irritate your skin?
[02:51:04.944 --> 02:51:09.685]  Are you happy washing your hands with stinking fragrances that gives your skin rashes?
[02:51:09.685 --> 02:51:13.767]  Are you happy paying new higher prices for smaller boxes?

[02:51:30.441 --> 02:51:31.262]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:51:31.262 --> 02:51:33.043]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:33.043 --> 02:51:34.704]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:34.704 --> 02:51:37.526]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:37.526 --> 02:51:39.827]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:39.827 --> 02:51:44.330]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:48.273]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:51:48.273 --> 02:51:52.055]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:51:52.055 --> 02:51:52.376]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:51:52.376 --> 02:51:53.817]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:51:59.485 --> 02:52:05.749]  Nanoparticle parasites, termed viruses, will only infect the iron-poisoned, copper-depleted population.
[02:52:05.749 --> 02:52:09.592]  Parasites require an iron supply in the host to thrive and replicate.
[02:52:09.592 --> 02:52:14.855]  Just as chemical poisons, parasites are propagated via the food and water supply and vaccines.
[02:52:14.855 --> 02:52:18.318]  Those born after 1945 have the vaccine parasites.
[02:52:18.318 --> 02:52:25.202]  The vaccine parasites have a virulence level that will trigger mass activation now, due to iron accumulating at an unprecedented rate.
[02:52:25.202 --> 02:52:28.004]  This is why disease, symptoms, and conditions are exploding in prevalence.
[02:52:29.445 --> 02:52:29.945]  We're good to go!
[02:52:59.392 --> 02:53:05.459]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[02:53:05.459 --> 02:53:11.225]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[02:53:11.225 --> 02:53:18.193]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[02:53:18.413 --> 02:53:27.664]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[02:53:27.664 --> 02:53:30.687]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[02:53:30.687 --> 02:53:33.370]  One World Whey is a whey protein food that supports DNA.
[02:53:33.370 --> 02:53:34.010]  We're good to go.
[02:54:04.465 --> 02:54:04.975]  He's gone!
[02:54:18.323 --> 02:54:21.785]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Solente.
[02:54:21.785 --> 02:54:29.090]  Gerald, I just wanted to get your take on this because I know you've covered the secessionist movement in many issues of the Trends Journal.
[02:54:29.090 --> 02:54:34.154]  A couple of days ago I wrote an article about how the CFR in their foreign affairs magazine
[02:54:34.654 --> 02:54:39.477]  Basically admitted that this populist uprising was sweeping America, was sweeping Europe.
[02:54:39.477 --> 02:54:52.086]  Of course, we saw a narrow defeat for Scottish independence recently, but we see similar, a similar wave of uprisings in places like Catalonia, Finland, the UK, Denmark, of course, with the rejection of the European Union.
[02:54:52.086 --> 02:55:04.074]  They said in their own words they need to quote, co-opt this populist uprising and kind of dismiss it away, you know, squirrel it down a rabbit hole to diffuse its impact, diffuse its power.
[02:55:04.074 --> 02:55:04.194]  So,
[02:55:05.095 --> 02:55:10.885]  How do you see them stopping this juggernaut of populism, or is it simply too runaway, too powerful to stop?
[02:55:12.125 --> 02:55:19.611]  Well the way they'll try to stop it is they'll try to, they'll beat up anybody and any groups that want to have it.
[02:55:19.611 --> 02:55:29.378]  So you see with any kind of street protest, and by the way what's going on in Hong Kong, certainly not a populist movement, but in many ways it is.
[02:55:29.378 --> 02:55:39.707]  In that they want to break away from the communist rule of China, who has put a law into place that the Communist Party vets the candidates who they can vote for.
[02:55:40.347 --> 02:55:43.288]  And it's the young people that are doing it, that are uprising.
[02:55:43.288 --> 02:55:45.128]  Because they have no jobs.
[02:55:45.128 --> 02:55:52.190]  And the jobs that they do have, that are available, they're giving it to cheaper Chinese labor that they're bringing in.
[02:55:52.190 --> 02:55:55.270]  And then we have, of course, coming up in Catalonia.
[02:55:55.270 --> 02:56:01.812]  And you have Rajoy, the Prime Minister of Spain, trying to stop that from coming, even to a vote, saying it's illegal.
[02:56:02.432 --> 02:56:09.116]  And as you mentioned, the other populist movements going on in Germany with their new party in Sweden.
[02:56:09.116 --> 02:56:14.400]  And it's very important also, Paul, to listen to the language.
[02:56:15.242 --> 02:56:28.450]  If it's a populist movement, it's very funny, in Germany, where they want to bail out of the Euro, and they want to bring nationalism back to the nation, how dare they?
[02:56:28.450 --> 02:56:30.391]  They call it a right-wing movement.
[02:56:30.391 --> 02:56:40.117]  What's happening in Sweden, however, they're calling it a left-wing movement, even though they're also against their big anti-immigration movement, because what's happened, again,
[02:56:40.737 --> 02:56:45.739]  Going back to our global nomic methodology of tracking trends, all things are connected.
[02:56:45.739 --> 02:56:48.221]  Where are the immigrants coming from?
[02:56:48.221 --> 02:56:50.562]  You're over there in Europe, you know the deal.
[02:56:50.562 --> 02:57:02.808]  They're coming over by boats that are sinking, that desperate people fleeing, whether it's Palestine, whether it's fleeing Libya, Tunisia, Egypt,
[02:57:03.348 --> 02:57:12.235]  Mali, the other country that, thanks to the overthrow of Gaddafi, has been overrun by the so-called Islamic militants.
[02:57:12.235 --> 02:57:14.537]  And by the way, this has nothing to do with Islam.
[02:57:14.537 --> 02:57:22.163]  It's a bunch of desperate, crazy people that are doing anything they can in places that have been corrupt and robbed and destroyed.
[02:57:22.163 --> 02:57:26.427]  But anyway, so you see the massive immigration flows coming into Europe.
[02:57:26.427 --> 02:57:27.868]  There's no stopping them.
[02:57:27.868 --> 02:57:29.690]  You see them coming into the United States.
[02:57:30.592 --> 02:57:31.832]  There's no stopping them.
[02:57:31.832 --> 02:57:36.353]  Oh, by the way, one of the plans of Occupy Peace in bringing home the troops?
[02:57:36.353 --> 02:57:37.653]  Seal the borders.
[02:57:37.653 --> 02:57:39.834]  We've got a job for the military.
[02:57:39.834 --> 02:57:44.955]  So, what I'm saying is, the populist movements are going to continue to gain in strength.
[02:57:44.955 --> 02:57:52.977]  As a matter of fact, I believe it was yesterday that Ron Paul again brought up the secessionist movements.
[02:57:52.977 --> 02:57:54.417]  It's the future.
[02:57:54.417 --> 02:57:59.278]  And the people can have the future if they choose to take it in their own hands.
[02:58:00.370 --> 02:58:03.997]  Okay, Gerald Talente, that brings us nicely to the end of the show.
[02:58:03.997 --> 02:58:08.344]  TrendsResearch.com and OccupyPeace.us is the other website, correct?
[02:58:08.344 --> 02:58:10.067]  That's correct.
[02:58:10.067 --> 02:58:13.293]  Gerald Talente, thanks for joining us today on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:14.226 --> 02:58:15.146]  Great being on with you.
[02:58:15.146 --> 02:58:16.567]  Thanks so much for having me.
[02:58:16.567 --> 02:58:17.708]  That's gonna do it for today.
[02:58:17.708 --> 02:58:18.888]  We'll be back tomorrow.
