[00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:54.640]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:55.682]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:57.325]  It is Friday, May 30th, 2014.
[00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:00.810]  And here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:01:04.758 --> 00:01:07.660]  How Militarizing Federal Agents Makes U.S.
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.261]  Citizens Potential Targets.
[00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:14.885]  And Info Wars continues exclusive coverage of Bilderberg 2014.
[00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:16.986]  All over the news that a lot of even U.S.
[00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:19.868]  publications are saying, yeah, this looks pretty serious.
[00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:21.309]  Why isn't this being covered?
[00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:26.452]  I mean, they're going now from ignoring it to laughing at us and admitting it's real, to not laughing at us.
[00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:30.895]  Only a few publications called us people that believe in space aliens and lizards.
[00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:46.920]  Yesterday the Washington Post disclosed a disturbing Department of Defense directive detailing which circumstances might be appropriate for the federal government to use lethal military force against us.
[00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:49.283]  That's right, the American people.
[00:01:50.293 --> 00:02:03.444]  In a December 2010 directive entitled Defense Support of Civil Authorities, the DoD talks about plans regarding military support for civilian law enforcement.
[00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.267]  So much for posse comitatus.
[00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:15.695]  Another blatant constitutional violation as it looks like the federal government continues to prepare for war against the American people.
[00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:32.357]  This would go into effect in the event of a large-scale unexpected civil disturbance when federal action, including the use of military force, will be authorized by the President, the Secretary of Defense, or other civil authorities.
[00:02:33.078 --> 00:02:34.759]  Now don't act so surprised, folks.
[00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.462]  I mean, we've been warning you about this for a very long time.
[00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:47.588]  And don't forget, it was the DOD training manuals that we discovered last year, along with the DHS, official DHS studies, they listed
[00:02:48.328 --> 00:03:08.618]  The Patriot Movement, the Liberty Movement, and the Tea Party as potential terrorists, along with parents who homeschool their children, returning veterans, law-abiding gun owners, and you, the conspiracy theorist watching this right now, you might be a potential terrorist, according to the insane federal government.
[00:03:08.898 --> 00:03:16.822]  Now, the DoD training manual says, for example, nowadays, instead of dressing in sheets or publicly espousing hate messages,
[00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:21.625]  Many extremists will talk of individual liberties and states' rights.
[00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:23.887]  Thomas Jefferson, George Washington.
[00:03:24.407 --> 00:03:28.190]  And they also talk about how to make the world a better place.
[00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.255]  That's right, it also says that the Founding Fathers would not be welcome in today's military.
[00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:40.220]  And I'm telling you, we are just one false flag terror attack away from a total federal takeover.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.243]  Just look at the nation's police departments, for example.
[00:03:43.283 --> 00:03:45.425]  They are totally militarized.
[00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:47.246]  They've got SWAT teams.
[00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:50.529]  They have armored vehicles designed for warfare.
[00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:51.910]  They have unmanned drones.
[00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:55.494]  I mean, they already resemble an occupying army.
[00:03:55.994 --> 00:04:01.516]  Meanwhile, the DHS is stockpiling billions of rounds of ammunition, and the U.S.
[00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:09.579]  military just built a $96 million training facility in Virginia that looks just like an American city.
[00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:18.642]  Our very own Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and David Knight, they were able to get exclusive footage of the training facility just before being detained by military police.
[00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:26.848]  So the military and police are preparing for civil unrest, and the U.S.
[00:04:26.908 --> 00:04:33.795]  government can now determine when it's appropriate to use lethal military force against Americans.
[00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:36.658]  Wow, I tell you what, a brave new world indeed.
[00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:43.505]  Meanwhile, the RAND Corporation and the New York Times, they are hyping up a new domestic terror threat.
[00:04:43.905 --> 00:04:56.776]  The RAND Corporation is working with the CIA, the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the DHS to hustle in the next phase in the perpetual war on manufactured terrorism.
[00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:00.219]  This is in an article on Infowars.com by Kurt Nimmo.
[00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:10.848]  We are now supposed to be worried about American-born and bred terrorists trained by al-Nusra in Syria returning home to wage jihad in the heartland.
[00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:18.692]  And this comes after a reported suicide truck bombing allegedly conducted by an unidentified American in Syria.
[00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:22.775]  So this is a shadowy and nameless American terrorist.
[00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:25.456]  Sounds like a CIA co-op to me.
[00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:29.919]  I mean, they're the ones that created the various Al-Qaeda terrorist groups to begin with.
[00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:36.963]  Yes, our government funds Al-Qaeda, or better known around here as Al-Cieda.
[00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:43.155]  Now, yesterday was the start of the Bilderberg Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:05:43.475 --> 00:06:00.123]  And as usual, most of the media outlets, with the exception of a handful of alternative media sites, are completely ignoring this historical event that is attended each year for the last, well, 50 years or so, by the most influential people in the world.
[00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:07.831]  InfoWars, however, continues to put this globalist event and their secretive agenda front and center.
[00:06:08.491 --> 00:06:17.220]  And joining us now from Copenhagen, Denmark, is InfoWars Nightly News anchor David Knight, bringing us exclusive coverage from Bilderberg 2014.
[00:06:19.215 --> 00:06:40.679]  Hey, right off the bat, tell us a little bit about the significance of the mainstream media blackout when it comes to Bilderberg because, I mean, we're talking about the most powerful organization in the world basically fixing the world policies behind closed doors, yet there continues to be a blackout when it comes to these meetings.
[00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:45.300]  Almost as if the power elite controls the mainstream media.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.641]  Have you seen any mainstream media there?
[00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.361]  Tell us about any mainstream media coverage that you've witnessed.
[00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:52.902]  None at all.
[00:06:53.262 --> 00:07:04.625]  Actually there was a little bit of coverage this morning from the Danish media and it was the purpose of that was to essentially change the
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.361]  I think so.
[00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:35.163]  Uh, it's also been the mainstream press and David Rockefeller has even, uh, been quoted as saying, thank you for, uh, your coverage or non-coverage of Pillerberg.
[00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:38.284]  Essentially, to paraphrase what he was saying, we couldn't have done it without you.
[00:07:38.344 --> 00:07:41.165]  So he thanked them for the fact that they weren't covering it.
[00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:43.866]  But what they always do, just like they did last year,
[00:07:44.446 --> 00:07:48.290]  They'll try to find something that's fringy or kooky and they'll cover that.
[00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.774]  And of course they need to think about what they perceive as excessive force.
[00:07:52.814 --> 00:07:54.515]  Whether or not that force was justified or not.
[00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:56.497]  Certainly the guy deserved to be arrested.
[00:07:56.557 --> 00:08:01.222]  The question is, did they continue using force after he had been subdued?
[00:08:01.242 --> 00:08:04.585]  And that's a judgment and a discussion that the Danish people need to have.
[00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:09.049]  And of course they have a police issue with excessive force just as we do back in the States.
[00:08:10.694 --> 00:08:23.498]  Well that's right, and on the rare occasion that I do see the mainstream media covering Bilderberg, they really downplay the significance, almost as if it's a casual gathering, like they're there just to play golf, or something like that.
[00:08:23.518 --> 00:08:33.582]  But we know better, we know that they are there to set a global agenda, and what kind of policies are being set this year, and who's attending this year?
[00:08:35.393 --> 00:08:41.358]  Yeah, let's talk a little bit about Bilderberg and about the CFR and about the Trilateral Commission.
[00:08:41.398 --> 00:08:46.322]  That kind of puts it, I think, in a perspective, because it's kind of a chronological perspective that started with that.
[00:08:47.143 --> 00:08:52.648]  Going back to early 1900s, you had in the Wilson administration, they created the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:08:52.688 --> 00:08:55.470]  And of course, Wilson was a big one-world government guy.
[00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.152]  You know, they created the League of Nations.
[00:08:57.212 --> 00:08:59.734]  He was on board with that whole agenda.
[00:09:00.734 --> 00:09:14.718]  Well, after the CFR was created, it was only in America that they were operating, and they essentially ran most of the state department, the department that's in government, and that continued on.
[00:09:14.938 --> 00:09:21.800]  Virtually all of the presidential candidates and the presidential opponents of the two major parties were all CFR members throughout the 20th century.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.661]  Even Reagan, who wasn't.
[00:09:23.841 --> 00:09:28.082]  Reagan and Goldwater were the standouts who were not part of the CFR.
[00:09:28.712 --> 00:09:35.498]  But even Reagan, when he got elected, appointed over 300 CFR members into the government.
[00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:38.340]  So, they have been the shadow government.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.325]  They've exerted a lot of influence, and of course, their agenda has been to create a global government.
[00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:51.351]  Now, in the 1950s, in 1954 actually, 60 years ago, Bilderberg held their first event.
[00:09:51.911 --> 00:09:53.212]  Now, what that did was that
[00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:58.764]  ...scope was changed from just being in the United States to being the United States and Western Europe.
[00:09:59.384 --> 00:10:06.769]  And then in 1973, the big new Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, working under David Rockefeller, created the Trilateral Commission.
[00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:11.291]  They extended that then from up to North America to Asia.
[00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:18.996]  Now what we're seeing this year in 2014, they're bringing in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, they're bringing in the Trans-Atlantic Partnership.
[00:10:19.336 --> 00:10:22.238]  What they're trying to do is to implement
[00:10:22.794 --> 00:10:22.934]  Yes.
[00:10:38.402 --> 00:10:41.183]  The Sovereign States, and so that's what they're trying to do this year.
[00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:45.645]  They're trying to do that, and it's a lot, it's about a lot more than just economic issues and trade.
[00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:58.430]  It's also about taking control of the internet, trying to do things with these Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Partnership, do things that they could not get past with SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, CISPA.
[00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:07.334]  They were not able to get those enacted in legislation, so now they're trying to do that through the back door, negotiating these treaties that are every bit as secretive
[00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:08.567]  Absolutely.
[00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:11.309]  It's all about money and you know when I was talking to Alex he had a very
[00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:32.130]  Very perceptive take on this mayor of Atlanta.
[00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:41.254]  You know, we know that they bring politicians in and they groom them to become president or whatever if they're going to be an obedient puppet, let's say.
[00:11:41.929 --> 00:11:44.371]  Well, this mayor of Atlanta, why is this guy coming in?
[00:11:44.411 --> 00:11:46.032]  Well, Alex said, you know, maybe that's part of it.
[00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:50.074]  But the other part of it is, is that Atlanta has a red-hot real estate market.
[00:11:50.554 --> 00:11:58.679]  And if anybody knows what's going on at local government, they know that at the local level, really, the politicians that are predominating there are all about real estate.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.421]  They usually come from a real estate background.
[00:12:01.441 --> 00:12:03.303]  That's been the case in the cities where I've lived.
[00:12:03.603 --> 00:12:08.928]  Because there's a lot of money to be made if you rezone areas and they can build that out.
[00:12:08.968 --> 00:12:16.454]  So Alex's comment was maybe this mayor of Atlanta is there passing on some insider information or getting things set up for these bankers to make money.
[00:12:16.494 --> 00:12:18.395]  But of course there's the political aspect of it too.
[00:12:18.716 --> 00:12:27.363]  They do want to have a puppet and in the past we have seen that a year after an unknown governor from Arkansas went to Bilderberg, Bill Clinton became president.
[00:12:27.703 --> 00:12:31.690]  Shortly after Tony Blair went to Bilderberg, he became Prime Minister.
[00:12:32.091 --> 00:12:35.156]  Margaret Thatcher came to Bilderberg, and they did not hit it off.
[00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:45.346]  She was very angry with their agenda when she found out what was going on, and within one year she was replaced by essentially an internal coup within her own party.
[00:12:45.386 --> 00:12:46.066]  They removed her.
[00:12:46.607 --> 00:12:48.567]  So we see this has happened over and over again.
[00:12:48.587 --> 00:12:53.589]  There's a lot of control, and essentially it's about the money because they want to own everything.
[00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:55.150]  They don't want there to be a middle class.
[00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.911]  They want to take over control of everything.
[00:12:58.051 --> 00:12:59.692]  They can never have enough.
[00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:02.013]  You know, when they asked David Rockefeller how much is enough,
[00:13:02.373 --> 00:13:04.455]  He famously said, just a little bit more.
[00:13:04.815 --> 00:13:06.056]  Well, they always want more.
[00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:07.257]  Well, that's right.
[00:13:07.318 --> 00:13:11.581]  And so far, what has the climate been like since you've been there?
[00:13:11.701 --> 00:13:13.683]  I know you're under constant surveillance.
[00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:22.471]  Our cameraman and editor, Josh, he was detained by police along with independent journalist Luke Rodowski.
[00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:24.573]  I heard he got detained and Dan Dix.
[00:13:24.893 --> 00:13:26.334]  So you're under constant surveillance.
[00:13:26.354 --> 00:13:28.096]  Do you feel like you're under a constant threat?
[00:13:29.898 --> 00:13:40.424]  Well, you know, before we got here, they were arrested and they basically tried to arrest everyone who was anywhere around the area that was associated with alternative media, just guilt by association.
[00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:46.347]  You know, it was Dan Dix and Luke Radowski who went over and confronted the people there.
[00:13:46.387 --> 00:13:49.889]  But, you know, anybody who was just in the area, they wanted to try to arrest them.
[00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:53.111]  And then even people who weren't down there at that time,
[00:13:54.494 --> 00:14:03.976]  Charlie Skelton from The Guardian, his wife, they were evicted from the hotel just because they had been seen talking to these people that they subsequently arrested.
[00:14:04.316 --> 00:14:06.577]  So, that kind of guilt by association.
[00:14:06.977 --> 00:14:14.379]  But, you know, just before we went on air yesterday, Josh was walking out of this hotel, where I'm broadcasting from here, carrying a camera.
[00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:15.699]  He wasn't shooting anything.
[00:14:16.483 --> 00:14:21.625]  And he was, the police were called on him and they rushed to intercept him and detain him.
[00:14:22.246 --> 00:14:27.228]  My wife came down and got me and said, you know, they got Josh, I think they're going to arrest him.
[00:14:27.908 --> 00:14:32.250]  He was considered to be a, quote, suspicious person or whatever because he was carrying a camera.
[00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.531]  I mean, that's absolutely important.
[00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:34.391]  That's obvious.
[00:14:34.831 --> 00:14:36.792]  He was not in the free speech zone.
[00:14:37.953 --> 00:14:39.653]  He should have stayed in the free speech zone.
[00:14:39.693 --> 00:14:40.494]  It would have been all right.
[00:14:41.434 --> 00:14:42.034]  So that's right.
[00:14:42.174 --> 00:14:43.295]  But you know, go ahead.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.403]  Hey, your Skype's cutting out a little bit right there.
[00:14:48.503 --> 00:14:49.865]  I think we got him back.
[00:14:50.145 --> 00:14:51.768]  Hey, tell us about any new developments.
[00:14:53.710 --> 00:15:00.260]  Well, you know, we didn't mention it to Alex earlier, Darren, but there's been a lot of petty, vindictive
[00:15:01.289 --> 00:15:02.049]  Your papers, sir.
[00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:26.861]  That's right, they thought they had us.
[00:15:27.342 --> 00:15:29.024]  But I have my identity paper.
[00:15:29.405 --> 00:15:31.789]  I got my press card, so they couldn't throw me out.
[00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.080]  Well, it looks like his Skype is cutting out.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.301]  Let's give those guys a break.
[00:15:37.321 --> 00:15:38.882]  We'll try to get a hold of them later.
[00:15:38.982 --> 00:15:42.024]  Meanwhile, the Bilderberg coverage will continue.
[00:15:42.364 --> 00:15:47.327]  Be sure to go to InfoWars.com forward slash B for Bilderberg.
[00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:55.772]  David Knight and Josh Owens will have live streams and updates all weekend long, including a big protest scheduled for tomorrow.
[00:15:56.333 --> 00:16:03.497]  This will be just outside the Marriott Hotel, where the power elite have gathered once again to plan their global
[00:16:03.937 --> 00:16:13.243]  And that means economic, political, and military integration worldwide, which also means 1776 worldwide.
[00:16:13.703 --> 00:16:15.644]  The InfoWars Nightly News will be right back.
[00:16:15.664 --> 00:16:16.945]  We're going to take a quick break.
[00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:17.745]  Stick around.
[00:16:17.785 --> 00:16:18.846]  We'll be back right after this.
[00:16:27.065 --> 00:16:34.231]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:16:34.331 --> 00:16:36.492]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:41.877]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:16:42.037 --> 00:16:47.141]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:16:47.281 --> 00:16:50.383]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:16:50.663 --> 00:16:54.585]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:16:54.785 --> 00:16:59.108]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:16:59.188 --> 00:17:09.294]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:17:09.534 --> 00:17:20.459]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[00:18:38.254 --> 00:18:40.635]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:18:40.836 --> 00:18:49.481]  Some interesting developments in the White House, as the Obama administration had two senior officials fall on their swords today.
[00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:53.063]  The first, the head of the VA, General Shinseki.
[00:18:53.563 --> 00:18:57.626]  He has taken the fall for the veterans health care scandal.
[00:18:58.166 --> 00:19:05.311]  And the head liar, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, has also announced he is going to step down.
[00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:09.833]  And here's a quick look at some of Jay Carney's most memorable moments.
[00:19:10.853 --> 00:19:16.316]  What city does this administration consider to be the capital of Israel?
[00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:21.439]  Jerusalem or Tel Aviv?
[00:19:21.979 --> 00:19:23.179]  I haven't had that question in a while.
[00:19:23.419 --> 00:19:24.920]  Our position has not changed, Connie.
[00:19:34.461 --> 00:19:43.285]  Under Secretary Shinseki's leadership, there has been a firm dedication to providing the kind of services that our veterans deserve, and we have decreased the disability claims.
[00:19:43.865 --> 00:19:52.330]  Given the evidence that we're seeing coming out and the suggestions that veterans have actually died waiting to get... I think the word you used is essential because you said the suggestion.
[00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.851]  This matter is under investigation.
[00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:55.192]  I would point you to what the IG said yesterday.
[00:19:55.232 --> 00:20:00.655]  But you weren't praising the VA for all the things that have been undone under Shinseki's leadership.
[00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:04.598]  When was the President first made aware of these problems?
[00:20:05.689 --> 00:20:08.951]  Uh, these fraudulent lists that were being kept to hide the wait times.
[00:20:08.991 --> 00:20:10.852]  When was he first made aware of those problems?
[00:20:11.012 --> 00:20:23.220]  These problems, the fact that there have been bureaucracies... If you mean the specific allegations that I think were reported first by your network out of Phoenix, I believe we learned about them through the reports.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:30.084]  I will double check if that's not the case, but that's when we learned about them, and that's when, as I understand it, Secretary Shinseki learned about them.
[00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:31.104]  It's not about Benghazi.
[00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:33.386]  Why turn it over in a Benghazi suit?
[00:20:35.121 --> 00:20:39.689]  You would have to ask the State Department about their process for responding to FOIA requests.
[00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.264]  You can just read it and then decide for yourself.
[00:20:46.344 --> 00:20:47.885]  You just had an attack on a U.S.
[00:20:47.945 --> 00:20:49.546]  consulate in Benghazi.
[00:20:49.566 --> 00:20:51.887]  You had Americans killed.
[00:20:52.047 --> 00:20:59.451]  You knew full well that what Susan Rice was primarily going to be asked about was about that attack, a terrorist attack on a U.S.
[00:20:59.511 --> 00:21:00.392]  consulate in Benghazi.
[00:21:00.412 --> 00:21:03.193]  Can I read the promo from your show, ABC This Week?
[00:21:03.253 --> 00:21:08.476]  We now know that that was not true, that in fact the CIA director, Morrell, just
[00:21:09.116 --> 00:21:18.266]  Former Director Morrell just testified last month that, quote, when she talked about the video, my reaction was that's not something the analysts have attributed this attack to.
[00:21:18.967 --> 00:21:20.388]  It did not come from the CIA.
[00:21:20.629 --> 00:21:24.833]  You stood there at the podium time after time and said that she was...
[00:21:25.874 --> 00:21:28.297]  Referring to talking points created by the CIA.
[00:21:28.677 --> 00:21:34.664]  Now we see a document that comes from the White House, not from the CIA, attributing the protests to the video.
[00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:45.437]  And we have the former director of the CIA saying that that was not something that his analysts... That document that we're talking about today was about the overall environment in the Muslim world.
[00:21:45.877 --> 00:21:50.158]  Did you say that the attack in Benghazi was rooted in a protest over the video?
[00:21:50.178 --> 00:21:51.079]  That's what she said.
[00:21:51.299 --> 00:22:05.724]  I know that you and I are both in a different time zone right now, but we're still in April of 2014, and this is a discussion about what she said and what turned out to be the case that we have had dozens of times in this room.
[00:22:05.744 --> 00:22:07.644]  The question is about, is it a conflict?
[00:22:07.664 --> 00:22:10.325]  And if you don't think it's a conflict, explain to us why it isn't.
[00:22:10.685 --> 00:22:12.926]  It's a hypothetical... Is it a conflict with Benghazi at all?
[00:22:13.615 --> 00:22:18.900]  Well, because... You can bypass the website and apply by phone or in person, and then it can be done in 25 minutes.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:25.085]  But these memos say that at the end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue, because they all have to go through the same portal.
[00:22:25.386 --> 00:22:26.667]  John, I get it.
[00:22:26.927 --> 00:22:32.072]  But the person who calls isn't the one who continues to wait after the paper application is filled.
[00:22:33.232 --> 00:22:37.413]  Your mocking is entertaining, but the President said that you could apply within 25 minutes.
[00:22:37.953 --> 00:22:44.214]  But John, we have never said that the end point of the process wouldn't still have to go through healthcare.gov.
[00:22:44.334 --> 00:22:45.355]  Actually, that's not true, Jay.
[00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:46.775]  Look at your own words.
[00:22:46.935 --> 00:22:51.656]  On October 21st, the same day, you said you can enroll over the phone, you can enroll in person.
[00:22:52.436 --> 00:22:57.177]  On October 23rd, you said there are four ways to enroll in the exchanges.
[00:22:57.657 --> 00:22:59.579]  You didn't say they all have to go through healthcare.gov.
[00:22:59.599 --> 00:23:03.563]  You said there are four ways to enroll in exchanges by phone, in person... John, you don't have to go through healthcare.gov.
[00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:12.331]  I'm not sure what you think you've discovered here, John, but if you're asking me... When the president said you can bypass the website, because you just said that it all has to go through the website.
[00:23:13.194 --> 00:23:14.754]  John, I think we've been through this.
[00:23:16.715 --> 00:23:30.079]  You call, you have an experience with, you have a conversation with somebody in the call-in center, you give them your information, they process it for you, they bypass the creation of an account, which is where most of the bottlenecks were happening for users on the website.
[00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:36.161]  Eventually that still has to go through healthcare.gov, but you've done the work with... It didn't do the eventually part.
[00:23:37.161 --> 00:23:38.242]  I give up.
[00:23:38.622 --> 00:23:44.384]  This president, any president, does not command the nation's attention.
[00:23:44.664 --> 00:23:45.604]  It is a campaign.
[00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:52.347]  The president is campaigning for growth and jobs.
[00:23:52.907 --> 00:23:56.048]  He is out there campaigning for growth and jobs.
[00:24:16.536 --> 00:24:22.318]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:24:22.338 --> 00:24:29.561]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:32.962]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:24:33.062 --> 00:24:34.843]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:24:35.103 --> 00:24:39.666]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:24:39.746 --> 00:24:42.508]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:24:42.668 --> 00:24:48.452]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:24:48.632 --> 00:24:52.114]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:24:52.294 --> 00:24:57.358]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:24:57.558 --> 00:25:00.520]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.624]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:25:06.744 --> 00:25:08.745]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:23.763]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:25:23.863 --> 00:25:26.105]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:25:26.265 --> 00:25:34.570]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:25:34.871 --> 00:25:50.181]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula, sourced from powerful organic herbs, and then concentrated for maximum
[00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:50.901]  I don't know.
[00:26:28.618 --> 00:26:34.702]  A new vaccine meant to counter HIV may actually increase the chances of contracting the disease.
[00:26:35.162 --> 00:26:46.608]  A new study shows that recipients of an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck using a genetically modified adenovirus actually increased their risk of contracting HIV infection.
[00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:52.752]  Researchers randomly assigned 800 uninfected, sexually active adults around South Africa
[00:26:53.172 --> 00:26:53.633]  We're good to go.
[00:27:16.633 --> 00:27:19.034]  And this is also the case for the Gardasil vaccine.
[00:27:19.134 --> 00:27:25.715]  It's been shown that vaccinating young girls with Gardasil may actually increase their risk of contracting cervical cancer.
[00:27:26.175 --> 00:27:36.778]  With the recent resurgence of measles, whooping cough, and varicella in highly immunized populations, research like this speaks to fundamental flaws in vaccine-centric health care.
[00:27:37.558 --> 00:27:41.942]  Children receive nearly 50 vaccines by the time they are 6 years old.
[00:27:42.723 --> 00:27:50.711]  26 of those are administered by their first birthday, potentially compromising the brain and immune system at a critical developmental stage.
[00:27:51.311 --> 00:27:58.178]  Instead of epidemics of measles and polio, now we have epidemics of chronic autoimmune and neurological disease.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:08.686]  Co-founder and President of the National Vaccine Information Center, Barbara Lowe Fisher, says that in the last 20 years, rates of asthma and attention deficit disorder have doubled.
[00:28:09.127 --> 00:28:11.428]  Diabetes and learning disabilities have tripled.
[00:28:11.848 --> 00:28:19.974]  Chronic arthritis now affects nearly 1 in 5 Americans, and in many states, autism has increased by 300% or more.
[00:28:20.334 --> 00:28:27.779]  And the assumption that these mass vaccination policies are playing no role is not only unscientific, it's dangerous.
[00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:40.706]  With so many unanswered questions about the safety and necessity of giving so many vaccines to children, the right to informed consent to vaccination takes on even greater legal and ethical significance.
[00:28:41.206 --> 00:28:44.628]  The issue of informed consent transcends medicine.
[00:28:44.968 --> 00:28:47.910]  What about the constitutional concept of individual freedom?
[00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:48.291]  I think so.
[00:29:12.645 --> 00:29:14.726]  Hey, that's going to do it for tonight's broadcast.
[00:29:14.746 --> 00:29:21.089]  The InfoWars Nightly News will return, Lord willing, next Monday through Friday, 7 o'clock p.m.
[00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:23.330]  Central Time, Texas time that is.
[00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.111]  Until then, have a great weekend.
[00:29:25.331 --> 00:29:27.232]  We'll see you back right here on Monday.
[00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:27.712]  Good night.
[00:29:33.027 --> 00:29:39.953]  Celebrate the spirit of freedom and liberty upon which our nation was founded at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:29:40.013 --> 00:29:43.796]  Molon Lave is ancient Greek for come and take it.
[00:29:43.836 --> 00:29:51.282]  This popular design combines both classic Greek Spartan imagery with modern M16 assault rifles.
[00:29:51.542 --> 00:29:55.485]  Now available in women's tees and proudly made in the USA.

[00:30:06.672 --> 00:30:08.733]  And introducing the Block-It Pocket.
[00:30:09.033 --> 00:30:14.936]  It renders your phone undetectable while protecting your private data and your health.
[00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:22.660]  Or take back your privacy and protect your personal information by getting your very own detractor cell phone pouch.
