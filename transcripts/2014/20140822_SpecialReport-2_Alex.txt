[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.502]  A bill making its way through the house would ban the sale, transfer, or possession of military-level body armor.
[00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:17.723]  Which is to say, if H.R.
[00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:24.286]  5344 is passed, outside of some grandfathering, the ordinary citizen would be banned from owning it.
[00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:27.307]  You have Mike Honda from California to thank for this.
[00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:33.091]  The bill includes helmets or shields with a ballistic resistance of type 3 armor.
[00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:37.534]  Would you buy your son the cheapest paper mache football helmet on the shelf?
[00:00:38.034 --> 00:00:40.736]  No, you want something that would actually protect him.
[00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:42.317]  The same with body armor.
[00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:45.840]  But the naysayers will undoubtedly point to this clip.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.964]  Officers find themselves against a fully automatic modified AK-47 with armored piercing bullets.
[00:00:55.555 --> 00:01:01.847]  Two bank robbers wearing body armor unleashed a barrage of ammunition unlike anything police have ever dealt with.
[00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:13.718]  As horrible as that situation was, and it was indeed horrible, that was when departments were armed with shotguns and pistols.
[00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.521]  Even the smallest departments now have rifles and heavy armor.
[00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:24.987]  Let me be clear about this though, those armaments should NOT be all purpose, such as menacing peaceful protesters.
[00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:30.331]  But if such a shooting was to occur again, police are now well equipped to deal with it.
[00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:37.893]  But just like the police can end up on the business end of a serious assailant, the ordinary citizen can get in the crossfire, too.
[00:01:39.854 --> 00:01:42.035]  My hands are up, bro.
[00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:42.815]  My hands are up.
[00:01:42.855 --> 00:01:43.795]  You're gonna kill me.
[00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.780]  Most people probably won't carry a Kevlar vest in the trunk of their car, but if you want to, that's your business.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.881]  Just like it's your business to carry a firearm.
[00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:22.022]  No law enforcement agency, let alone a politician, can guarantee your safety 100% of the time.
[00:02:22.303 --> 00:02:25.003]  That's why you should have the right to protect yourself.

[00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:41.137]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:43.480]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:55.415]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs after consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others.
