[00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:15.942]  Every year, colleges across the country hold annual all-you-can-eat taco fiestas.
[00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:19.423]  But apparently, that was a little offensive to some this year.
[00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:30.006]  So they banned the word fiesta from college campuses, you can't wear sombreros, you can't wear racially insensitive cowboy and Indian costumes, and all sorts of things.
[00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.326]  Have we gone too far?
[00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:39.388]  Should we make fiesta change their name because it is racist and offensive to a handful of people?
[00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:46.410]  A lot of college campuses now are having to stop throwing parties that have a cultural theme because people find it offensive.
[00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.991]  A lot of parties were shut down for Cinco de Mayo, for instance.
[00:00:50.812 --> 00:00:57.394]  Why do you think people are offended by tacos, sombreros, tequila?
[00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:01.375]  People just find a bunch of different racial things.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.542]  For instance, like you said, the taco shirt or like sombreros and stuff like that.
[00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:11.024]  They think like you're making fun of them type things or something like that, you know.
[00:01:11.424 --> 00:01:14.265]  So a bunch of people just have different perspectives on things like that.
[00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:15.606]  I don't think it's racist.
[00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:17.407]  It's part of someone's culture.
[00:01:17.587 --> 00:01:22.310]  It's good to have different... In different countries, they have American parties.
[00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.010]  So I don't understand.
[00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:25.731]  We don't think it's racist.
[00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:30.174]  We think it's kind of cool to see like they want to have our type of culture over there.
[00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:32.635]  So for us to be sensitive and
[00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:38.278]  To shut down Cinco de Mayo parties, that's going a little too far.
[00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:44.560]  I'm the kind of guy that doesn't really get that offended that much, so I think a lot of it's blown out of proportion.
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.440]  Yeah.
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:53.443]  I understand being sensitive to people, but it seems like recently more and more they're getting more nitpicky about what to be offended about.
[00:01:53.483 --> 00:01:57.645]  It seems like being offended is the cool thing to be, so.
[00:01:58.325 --> 00:01:59.045]  I don't think so.
[00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:00.246]  No?
[00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:00.986]  I mean...
[00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:10.581]  Yes, the students wear the... Yeah, well they basically say they can't have fiestas because having a fiesta is racist.
[00:02:11.322 --> 00:02:11.922]  I don't think so.
[00:02:12.443 --> 00:02:12.683]  What?
[00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.426]  Look at this liberated person here!
[00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:18.129]  Do you think that I should learn Spanish?
[00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.531]  You want Spanish?
[00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:20.932]  Oh my God!
[00:02:23.598 --> 00:02:25.461]  I'm sorry, I don't know English.
[00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:32.069]  I feel like we've gotten very politically correct, taking it to the extreme.
[00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:33.591]  Is that politically correct though?
[00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:34.973]  Is it?
[00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:36.375]  Or has it just been...
[00:02:37.202 --> 00:02:40.644]  Really sensitive like you're saying because I mean we're here in America.
[00:02:40.684 --> 00:02:48.449]  We're supposed to be equality of any race That's what we were built upon and now now it's like no no don't be don't do that.
[00:02:48.469 --> 00:03:02.078]  You're too Yeah, it's supposed to be about embracing other cultures But now it's like no you can't do that because that doesn't represent me in this particular case at Dartmouth It was one girl that said she was offended and the other students were like why this is it's just fun.
[00:03:02.118 --> 00:03:05.200]  It's a fiesta They're not allowed to say the word fiesta
[00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.070]  It just seems like that's all the rage, you know?
[00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:18.316]  Yeah, well it seems like when you go to college and get a degree, that's the new thing, is to fight for these arbitrary offenses against your culture or this or that.
[00:03:18.757 --> 00:03:30.023]  Meanwhile, you know, they're playing white privilege blame games at some colleges and like, me as a white person, I'm not allowed to say anything because they're like, well that's white privilege.
[00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:30.783]  Yeah, check your privilege.
[00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:39.884]  My mom didn't pay for me to go to school, but that's what they're saying is that I had a privileged life and that I didn't work really hard.
[00:03:40.765 --> 00:03:41.425]  Should I be offended?
[00:03:42.547 --> 00:03:44.229]  I would if I was in your situation.
[00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.733]  They were like, you didn't build that!
[00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:52.062]  I tried.
[00:03:52.182 --> 00:03:58.504]  It's like, I tried my hardest to get to where I am today, and for you to take that away from me, that's horrible.
[00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:04.786]  And then for them to say, no, we can do it for you, but you can't say anything bad about us.
[00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:07.607]  It's like, where's the equalness?
[00:04:07.627 --> 00:04:08.087]  I don't know.
[00:04:08.493 --> 00:04:11.654]  Do you think it's okay that only white people should be able to have hamburgers?
[00:04:12.154 --> 00:04:12.955]  No.
[00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:13.595]  We did that.
[00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:16.436]  No, I don't think it's okay.
[00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:20.877]  I mean, like myself, you can't tell that I'm mixed.
[00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:23.098]  My dad's black and white and my mom is Mexican.
[00:04:23.518 --> 00:04:25.799]  So I was like, I got everything in me.
[00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:30.101]  Well, apparently now America has become the place where we stop celebrating.
[00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:33.482]  It's the Manila envelope of the world.
[00:04:34.218 --> 00:04:35.099]  Manila envelope.
[00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.879]  I like that.
[00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:38.901]  It's an interesting word for it.
[00:04:39.021 --> 00:04:39.782]  We're all Manila.
[00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:47.607]  I think every culture has the right to celebrate however they want to celebrate and you're not forced to celebrate something you don't want to.
[00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:50.709]  Same thing with Christmas or other holidays.
[00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:51.289]  It's Kwanzaa.
[00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:52.390]  You don't have to celebrate them.
[00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.592]  Every person has a right to do what they want to do.
[00:04:56.513 --> 00:04:58.054]  Well, it is America.
[00:04:58.414 --> 00:04:59.655]  We were founded on those rights.
[00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:01.296]  So you like hamburgers?
[00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:02.670]  Yeah, I do.
[00:05:03.493 --> 00:05:04.638]  And I like tacos!
[00:05:04.698 --> 00:05:06.064]  I mean, I don't get it.
[00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:12.676]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:14.797]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:05:14.997 --> 00:05:20.978]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:05:21.178 --> 00:05:26.160]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.941]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:35.642]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:05:35.942 --> 00:05:44.330]  The Infowars LifeSilver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.491]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:05:46.692 --> 00:05:58.222]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your
[00:05:58.322 --> 00:05:58.803]  We're good.
