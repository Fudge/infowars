[00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:04.127]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com in Spokane, Washington.
[00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:08.951]  Now we're standing outside of the Superior Courthouse where there is an I-594 protest going on.
[00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:11.994]  Now just moments ago, a heckler was in the crowd.
[00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:17.259]  They kindly asked him to move, leave the crowd, and apparently people saw him.
[00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:20.742]  They witnessed this man over here being arrested right now assault a woman.
[00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:23.044]  Now the police have come out of this vehicle over here.
[00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:27.609]  They've put him in handcuffs and they are now removing him from this demonstration.
[00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.292]  Tensions are pretty high here in Spokane today.
[00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:34.817]  The citizens of Spokane are extremely angry that this I-594 is being passed.
[00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.221]  Now what that is, it makes it illegal to transfer your firearm.
[00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:49.285]  Now what that means is if you and I go to a shooting range, we want to go out, take turns shooting each other's guns, we can no longer do that.
[00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:50.925]  That's a Class 3 felony.
[00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:59.249]  Now what you have to do is you have to go through a very in-depth background check on that person before you can give them your weapon.
[00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.171]  So if you don't do that, that is a felony, you can be arrested.
[00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.000]  So this is something the citizens of Spokane are extremely upset about.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.182]  They're angry because it infringes on their rights.
[00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:12.482]  It goes against the Constitution.
[00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:14.683]  It goes against what we as Americans stand for.
[00:01:15.103 --> 00:01:17.244]  And they're saying right now, we're not going to stand for this.
[00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:18.305]  We don't want this.
[00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:19.045]  Get it out of here.
[00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:21.546]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
