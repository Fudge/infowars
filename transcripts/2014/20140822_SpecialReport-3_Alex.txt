[00:00:10.856 --> 00:00:15.059]  Joe Biggs with Infowars.com in Ferguson Missouri day number nine.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.924]  We just walked out on the streets, went from the McDonald's down to the QT a couple times.
[00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:25.108]  A little bit quieter mood, but you know there's one neat thing that's out here.
[00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:27.710]  There's a quite a few people out here awake.
[00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.471]  Just like the police bear arms, we can bear arms.
[00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:33.332]  It's not illegal in Missouri to carry a weapon.
[00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:35.152]  You're not doing anything criminal.
[00:00:35.332 --> 00:00:37.393]  They're doing something criminal.
[00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:39.793]  As a police officer, you're supposed to enforce the law.
[00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.714]  Forget the fraternal order of police.
[00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:43.094]  Forget the brotherhood.
[00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:45.155]  You should have been thinking about your family.
[00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:47.316]  And you should have said, I'm going to stand for what's right.
[00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:51.678]  I'm not going to be out here tear gassing people that's peacefully protesting, because that's not right.
[00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.659]  I'm going to set my war gear down.
[00:00:53.959 --> 00:01:01.443]  Because Barack Obama said, why am I looking on the TV at two different screens, Gaza and Ferguson, and I'm seeing the same thing?
[00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:04.805]  Why is that happening here in America, when it's illegal?
[00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.706]  You can't use tear gas in war.
[00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.267]  So what are you using it here for?
[00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:12.148]  You don't know the law, but I know the law.
[00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:19.973]  And I appreciate all the cameras out here watching you guys do your lawlessness, because we don't even have to say anything.
[00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:28.179]  We're just going to go to the Constitution, and we're going to show the Declaration of Independence, and we're going to show how you had no regard for it, and we're going to get rid of you.
[00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:31.741]  And then we're going to get righteous people that want to uphold what's right.
[00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:32.802]  We're tired of what's wrong.
[00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:34.523]  We're tired of you killing our kids.
[00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:36.204]  We're tired of being intimidated by you.
[00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:40.526]  Sitting out here in Hummers and all these military vehicles.
[00:01:41.047 --> 00:01:41.767]  This is freedom?
[00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:43.188]  That's not freedom.
[00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:44.709]  That's being a tyrant.
[00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.590]  That is intimidation.
[00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:47.851]  That is illegal.
[00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:50.553]  And you guys are supposed to uphold the law.
[00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:53.395]  It was pretty peaceful mood tonight so far.
[00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:59.699]  I mean, the only people out here so far that I've seen that have any kind of attitude would be the police officers yet again.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.680]  I'm parked back here.
[00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:04.521]  Here we go.
[00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:04.801]  See?
[00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:05.802]  Exactly like this.
[00:02:05.822 --> 00:02:07.062]  This is a police state.
[00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:08.202]  Total martial law.
[00:02:08.222 --> 00:02:11.583]  These guys are out of their minds.
[00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.144]  My vehicle's up here.
[00:02:13.964 --> 00:02:14.364]  Okay.
[00:02:14.864 --> 00:02:15.184]  Got it.
[00:02:15.244 --> 00:02:23.887]  They're not allowing anyone to stand still, stop, even if they're on the sidewalk.
[00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:26.168]  Y'all not walking, we not walking.
[00:02:26.228 --> 00:02:26.708]  We with you.
[00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:27.688]  It's never been like this.
[00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:29.609]  If we get gas, your ass is gonna get gas too.
[00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:36.442]  Well, I'm out here defeating or informing people of the tyranny that is in our backyard.
[00:02:37.403 --> 00:02:41.325]  I'm trying to awake as many people as possible as we are here.
[00:02:42.106 --> 00:02:46.548]  Spreading truth and knowledge to Americans and people worldwide.
[00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.430]  Because this doesn't just affect America.
[00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.531]  This doesn't just affect Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:54.933]  It affects everyone in the world.
[00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:57.230]  They're treating us like animals.
[00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:59.132]  Does it make you feel safer?
[00:02:59.152 --> 00:03:00.413]  No, not at all.
[00:03:00.653 --> 00:03:01.814]  They're here to protect us.
[00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:04.517]  They're making us feel like we have to be scared.
[00:03:04.897 --> 00:03:06.138]  We're looking back for police.
[00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.083]  Once again, I'm Joe Biggs with our InfoWars crew in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:29.214]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:32.557]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:33.337]  Here we go, folks!
[00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:34.278]  I'm being assaulted!
[00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:40.503]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:03:40.663 --> 00:03:46.607]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeland security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:50.470]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.552]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:03:53.572 --> 00:04:01.738]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.040]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.161]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:14.270]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
