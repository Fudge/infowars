[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.056]  Throughout history, authoritarian regimes have wanted to control the youth and condition them, to spy on their parents and to join Hitler Youth.
[00:00:07.597 --> 00:00:14.384]  Publications like Forbes and The Week have asked the question, why is there a war on lemonade stands?
[00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:16.466]  We're going to answer that important question.
[00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.849]  An 11-year-old girl's lucrative cupcake business is in limbo.
[00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:26.653]  She was prohibited from selling cupcakes that were made in her home and had not made anyone sick.
[00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:31.936]  A 4-year-old Iowa girl had her lemonade stand shut down by local police.
[00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:32.677]  Her crime?
[00:00:33.057 --> 00:00:39.341]  She had been selling lemonade at 25 cents a cup for less than half an hour and probably didn't make much more than $5.
[00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:42.363]  Police informed her that a permit would cost $400.
[00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:54.892]  In protest to this kooky and insane attack on an American tradition, August 20th is now unofficially National Lemonade Freedom Day.
[00:00:55.472 --> 00:01:11.023]  In Virginia, Martha Bonita was threatened with $5,000 per day fines for such horrific crimes as hosting a birthday party for eight 10-year-olds on her ruled property without a permit and for advertising pumpkin carvings.
[00:01:11.563 --> 00:01:18.145]  In response, Delegate Bob Marshall introduced HB 1219 into the Virginia General Assembly.
[00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:34.951]  It states, local officials who abuse zoning authority powers to cower citizens into submission and deprive landowners of constitutional rights in the enjoyment of their land must be subject to fines and actual damages that they cause, including attorney fees.
[00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:49.000]  Colorado students and their parents are furious at their high school after administrators rejected their request for Spirit Week Day honoring America because it might offend non-Americans.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.123]  In essence, the high school leaned on the side of racism rather than to allow patriotism to flourish.
[00:01:56.164 --> 00:02:03.927]  An 11-year-old Oregon girl, Madison Root, tried to help her father pay for expensive braces by selling mistletoe over the holidays.
[00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:13.692]  According to her father, the private security guard hired to oversee the Portland security market told her to simply beg for money rather than to sell mistletoe.
[00:02:14.172 --> 00:02:18.954]  Her father stated, he does not want to encourage begging and wants people to earn their living.
[00:02:19.574 --> 00:02:21.815]  She is so keen on high work ethic.
[00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:23.315]  Madison confirmed this.
[00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:24.836]  I don't want to beg.
[00:02:25.056 --> 00:02:26.976]  I'd rather work for something than beg.
[00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:28.217]  People are selling stuff.
[00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:29.537]  This is a public place.
[00:02:29.857 --> 00:02:37.400]  Despite this reprimanding of her business, she now has 38, and I did say 38, people working for her at a decent $9 an hour.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.141]  The answer to these attacks is to buy local and support small businesses in your community.
[00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:49.302]  The establishment would have you buying big box store goods from Foxconn slave factories.
[00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:53.383]  Fought with your dollars and buy local American goods and organic foods.
[00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:58.405]  Young people, don't let them intimidate you and stop you from becoming free market.
[00:02:58.645 --> 00:02:59.405]  Get outside!
[00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:04.086]  Stop playing video games and watching TV and start interacting with the real world.
[00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:08.708]  Don't let your brain fall into decay and rot like so many others already have.
[00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:10.009]  Start your own business.
[00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.829]  Write your own book.
[00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:11.729]  Start a garden.
[00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.810]  Become a voice for your fellow Americans.
[00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:19.533]  The people are fighting back against the globalist movement to outlaw grassroots bartering into extinction.
[00:03:20.353 --> 00:03:23.815]  Hi, I'm Rex Jones, and I'm part of the Resistance to Tyranny.
[00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:26.776]  You, too, are part of the Resistance to Tyranny.
[00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:32.239]  And remember, if you are watching this transmission, you are the Resistance.
