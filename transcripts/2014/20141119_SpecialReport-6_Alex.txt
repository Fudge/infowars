[00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:11.680]  We're here in Ferguson, Missouri and many of our viewers are probably familiar with the Hands Up, Don't Shoot chant.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.321]  Now there's something a little different.
[00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:14.961]  Hands Up, Don't Loot.
[00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.342]  That is a crowdfunded billboard that's going to be somewhere around here.
[00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:19.723]  Now we don't know exactly where.
[00:00:20.123 --> 00:00:26.050]  But we were told through various media sites that it's going to be somewhere around the original shooting site of Mike Brown.
[00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.533]  Mike being shot a few blocks down that way.
[00:00:28.553 --> 00:00:30.535]  So we're up here standing in front of these billboards.
[00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:34.800]  We can't say that these are going to be the billboards in question but these are some of the nearest billboards to the
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.461]  We're good.
