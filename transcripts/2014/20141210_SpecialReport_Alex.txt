[00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:23.195]  As Gruber goes before Congress to be drilled for torturing the data about Obamacare in order to deceive the American people, a heavily edited and censored report about actual torture was released by the Senate.
[00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:33.077]  Republican and Democrat reactions have been as predictable as they are hypocritical, but the most surprising reaction has come from some Libertarians who have in the past opposed torture.
[00:00:33.477 --> 00:00:36.258]  More on that in a moment, but first the politicians.
[00:00:36.678 --> 00:00:43.382]  Senator Feinstein is sanctimoniously promoting the release as a confrontation of the ugly truth.
[00:00:43.703 --> 00:00:54.950]  History will judge us by our commitment to a just society governed by law and the willingness to face an ugly truth and say never again.
[00:00:55.796 --> 00:01:04.498]  Without any sense of irony or guilt, Feinstein says that on the very same day that the NDAA heads to the Senate floor for the fourth time under her leadership.
[00:01:04.838 --> 00:01:14.640]  It destroys our commitment to a just society governed by the rule of law when it presumes to authorize illegal, unconstitutional actions like indefinite detention of U.S.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.561]  citizens by the military without any charges, as well as rendition and presumably enhanced interrogation.
[00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:23.842]  Federal government's euphemism for torture.
[00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:26.222]  She won't face that ugly truth.
[00:01:26.823 --> 00:01:28.523]  She won't say, never again.
[00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:31.063]  But rather, let's do it again.
[00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:44.226]  And of course, after the 1600-page NDAA was released at 1030 at night, the GOP House passed it just a day and a half later, mocking their pledge of 2010 to always read the bill.
[00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:52.108]  And they're going to do the same thing with the omnibus continuing resolution spending bill, keeping it secret until just a few hours before the vote.
[00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:58.251]  And will the Republican who's likely to take Feinstein's place on the Senate Intelligence Committee be any better than Feinstein?
[00:01:58.911 --> 00:01:59.992]  Absolutely not.
[00:02:00.732 --> 00:02:09.337]  Richard Burr will be much worse, having already gone on record saying there shouldn't be any public hearing about what the CIA or the NSA does about anything.
[00:02:10.037 --> 00:02:26.318]  But the most amazing reaction that shows how low America has already sunk into accepting a lawless government comes from the Executive Director of the ACLU, who previously lobbied Bush to oppose presidential pardons for those who had planned and authorized torture.
[00:02:26.798 --> 00:02:34.100]  The ACLU director points out that neither Obama nor the Justice Department has shown any appetite for holding anyone accountable.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.602]  When the department did conduct an investigation, it appeared not to have interviewed any of the prisoners who were tortured.
[00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:50.445]  And it repeatedly abused the state secret's privilege in order to derail cases brought by prisoners, including Americans, who were tortured as enemy combatants.
[00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:54.227]  But now the ACLU is calling for formal pardons for these people.
[00:02:54.407 --> 00:03:02.693]  Their tortured logic, worthy of John Gruber, is that doing nothing, as Obama has and will do, is a tacit pardon.
[00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:09.617]  We need to have, they say, an explicit pardon, so we can, as a society, at least acknowledge that laws were broken.
[00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:10.618]  That's it.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:20.887]  No longer any hope of criminal prosecution for leaders and government employees who violate the law, commit treason and torture people, including American citizens.
[00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:24.110]  No, the best we can hope for is to say it was wrong.
[00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.874]  But don't think that you're going to even get that in this kind of lawless society.
[00:03:29.414 --> 00:03:35.819]  Our government no longer has the will to punish cops who murder or politicians who torture and murder.
[00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.122]  That's the real ugly truth we have to confront.
[00:03:39.622 --> 00:03:41.628]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:56.673]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:06.881]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:04:07.182 --> 00:04:10.905]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:16.150]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.756]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:25.358]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:28.461]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:04:28.842 --> 00:04:34.347]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:04:34.787 --> 00:04:41.452]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
