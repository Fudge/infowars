[00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:02.612]  Coast to Coast.
[00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:04.414]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:08.339]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:16.848]  Big Brother.
[00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:19.471]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:22.114]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:24.504]  You want answers?
[00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:27.306]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:33.709]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.933]  And ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this original worldwide transmission.
[00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:48.558]  It is Sunday, May 4th, 2014.
[00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.846]  We'll be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:57.829]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.172]  Again, thank you for joining us here on the Sunday broadcast.
[00:01:00.572 --> 00:01:01.393]  Wow, where to begin?
[00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:06.594]  I saw a story on Drudge Report on Friday that really concerned me.
[00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:08.295]  I want to talk about some of this in the next segment.
[00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:12.918]  CDC confirms first case of MERS virus in America.
[00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:18.421]  Health officials say a deadly virus from the Middle East has turned up in the U.S.
[00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:19.222]  for the first time.
[00:01:19.562 --> 00:01:22.944]  And of course, earlier in the week, the CDC and the World Health Organization at the U.N.
[00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:30.268]  said the biggest threat medically worldwide now is drug-resistant viruses and bacteria.
[00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:31.829]  Bacteria being foremost.
[00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:41.457]  And you add the cocktail of antibiotics, all the weird drugs, the stuff that's mutating with GMO, this is just going to get more and more serious here on out.
[00:01:41.498 --> 00:01:48.224]  And the globalists really don't want us to get a lot of these medical treatments and things that are already available.
[00:01:48.744 --> 00:01:49.725]  So we're going to be...
[00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:52.752]  Breaking some of that down today.
[00:01:52.892 --> 00:02:05.498]  Also, I saw some reports earlier in the week that, oh, the GOP, you know, doesn't want companies to come out with biometric guns so criminals can't kill people or we can't have mass shootings.
[00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:10.060]  The issue is Obama wants to ban guns, previously made that aren't biometric.
[00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:12.722]  And I've got another article I know out there in the printer
[00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:17.106]  That would just be really fantastic on that subject.
[00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:21.491]  I forgot to get that, so I need that little tidbit.
[00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:22.292]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:28.539]  And of course, we covered this a few weeks ago, but it dovetails with the new article on this subject.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.262]  GOP Fears Executive Order.
[00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:34.180]  On biometric guns.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.407]  And oh, just one little old grandfather wanted to come out with a biometric gun and the NRA was mean to him.
[00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:45.770]  Wow, you can't even have a free market here in America.
[00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:47.992]  It's just not fair.
[00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:52.736]  And they say that the GOP fears it and that it's a terrible thing.
[00:02:53.357 --> 00:02:58.381]  So that's all coming up here on the Transmission Today.
[00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:06.321]  We're also going to get into some of the fraudulent employment numbers that are out there that just show how Orwellian everything's gotten.
[00:03:07.302 --> 00:03:08.664]  Payroll in the U.S.
[00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:10.707]  rises most since 2012, $203,000, but that's all.
[00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.441]  All and then some because it's actually a negative number.
[00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:20.403]  If you look at the real numbers, we've got a lot of economists, Dr. Bunker Roberts and others.
[00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:28.248]  It's all people getting cut from 40 to below 30 hours so Obamacare doesn't kick in, having to get other jobs.
[00:03:28.828 --> 00:03:30.289]  So this is pure manipulation.
[00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.910]  They claim we have a 0.1 growth rate.
[00:03:34.492 --> 00:03:35.553]  Uh, in this country.
[00:03:36.113 --> 00:03:37.254]  And that's even with Koch numbers.
[00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:39.256]  That is depressionary on every front.
[00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:40.577]  And I'm not being negative.
[00:03:40.877 --> 00:03:43.679]  We have to admit that if we're ever going to have any chance to turn this around.
[00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.782]  And then coming up... I told you about this years ago.
[00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:49.624]  Now it's being publicly announced.
[00:03:50.144 --> 00:03:53.466]  Coming soon, a brain implant to restore memory in the troops!
[00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:55.048]  In the troops!
[00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.289]  Oh, Bob got hurt!
[00:03:57.176 --> 00:03:58.177]  But now he's got a brain chip.
[00:03:58.197 --> 00:03:59.518]  He's going back into combat.
[00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:00.759]  He's not depressed.
[00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.920]  He's not sad.
[00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:05.163]  There's no more problems anymore.
[00:04:05.623 --> 00:04:08.926]  That is out of AFP, AP, you name it.
[00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:12.189]  The stuff of science fiction now becomes reality.
[00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.354]  It is all coming up in great detail on the other side of this break.
[00:04:18.414 --> 00:04:23.138]  And it's also vitally important for listeners who are tuning in to spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:25.260]  That's how we're reaching more people.
[00:04:27.093 --> 00:04:33.636]  That's why I am able to come in here and do hour after hour of radio and TV every day.
[00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:35.957]  It's because I realize what the stakes are.
[00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:37.957]  I realize how serious all of this is.
[00:04:38.498 --> 00:04:45.000]  I realize what we're facing as a society and that we have no future if we don't beat these people.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.341]  I've gotten an aggressive
[00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:50.122]  Resistance mode and resistance is victory.
[00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:53.323]  That's why they tell you, oh, Obamacare is here to stay bipartisanly.
[00:04:53.643 --> 00:04:56.663]  No one can stop it, even though it's 80 plus percent negative.
[00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:57.984]  It's to make you feel weak.
[00:04:58.284 --> 00:05:03.025]  There's also big news on the Benghazi front and the subpoena of hair carry.
[00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:04.905]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:05:05.245 --> 00:05:08.226]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the sites.
[00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:17.113]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:19.376]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:05:19.576 --> 00:05:24.781]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:30.047]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:33.270]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.473]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:05:37.673 --> 00:05:41.996]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:52.223]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:05:52.423 --> 00:05:56.806]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:05:56.906 --> 00:06:03.350]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.491]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:06:34.155 --> 00:06:35.257]  There is a war.
[00:06:35.697 --> 00:06:36.699]  It's happening now.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.363]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:06:39.924 --> 00:06:41.746]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:06:42.508 --> 00:06:43.990]  We are the resistance.
[00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.993]  We are the Infowar.
[00:06:49.657 --> 00:06:57.641]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:06:58.181 --> 00:06:59.382]  until 2 p.m.
[00:06:59.942 --> 00:07:01.903]  Central Standard Time.
[00:07:02.063 --> 00:07:08.146]  Thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide original transmission.
[00:07:08.707 --> 00:07:17.311]  It is Sunday, the fourth day of May 2014, and we'll be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday.
[00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:20.796]  We have the weekday transmission as well from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:21.176 --> 00:07:23.279]  right here on stations all over the country.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.162]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:07:25.202 --> 00:07:29.889]  Let's look back at the big news, the important news from my perspective, in the last week.
[00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:33.754]  Then we have a whistleblower guest joining us in the second hour.
[00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:43.925]  That is as big as the Snowden situation, as big as the Pentagon Papers that came out back in the 60s.
[00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:46.785]  This is really a huge issue.
[00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:57.187]  This is really a Daniel Ellsberg or a Snowden-level piece of information you're going to be hearing here, dealing with Benghazi and more.
[00:07:57.207 --> 00:07:59.108]  I'll tell you more about that coming up.
[00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:00.328]  Again, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:02.224]  Where to start?
[00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:05.825]  The anti-gunners have a new way to try to get our guns.
[00:08:05.906 --> 00:08:07.126]  It's biometrics.
[00:08:08.006 --> 00:08:11.127]  We're going to break down what's really happening on that front, coming up.
[00:08:11.728 --> 00:08:16.349]  Also, the latest on the Bundy Ranch BLM land grab, now coming to Texas.
[00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:19.130]  They want people's private land on both sides of the Red River.
[00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.151]  Rick Perry says try to come and take it.
[00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:23.592]  Gotta hand it to Rick Perry for standing up.
[00:08:24.132 --> 00:08:25.092]  The governor, that's good.
[00:08:25.112 --> 00:08:26.473]  But it ties into feds.
[00:08:26.493 --> 00:08:29.574]  Consider taking Alaskan tribal land into trust.
[00:08:30.174 --> 00:08:30.834]  That's AP.
[00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:33.196]  They're now not enough to have 80 plus percent of Alaska.
[00:08:33.216 --> 00:08:33.776]  They want more.
[00:08:34.117 --> 00:08:36.338]  We're going to be breaking that down coming up.
[00:08:36.798 --> 00:08:45.084]  We're also going to get into a really wild story that's not anything unknown to our listeners, but is new news to mainstream media.
[00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:53.330]  DARPA and the Pentagon are coming out saying the answer to the troops' depression is brain chips.
[00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.151]  This is AFP, RT, and AP.
[00:08:56.312 --> 00:08:56.832]  Not me.
[00:08:58.153 --> 00:08:59.694]  Sure, I told you this 15 years ago.
[00:09:01.164 --> 00:09:03.467]  I knew troops were getting brain chips five years ago.
[00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:05.409]  Not all of them.
[00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.750]  But they're doing it.
[00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:13.318]  They're now rolling it out and going, oh, we've been doing testing for a long time, but now we're rolling out the brain chips.
[00:09:13.798 --> 00:09:14.078]  Shub.
[00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:18.967]  That is all coming up on the broadcast today.
[00:09:19.868 --> 00:09:29.294]  We've also got some interesting news we're going to be getting into, not just on Benghazi, but how that ties into government narcotics trafficking and a lot more.
[00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:35.158]  Also, federal regulators could be empowered to enter your home and inspect your cars and things without warrants.
[00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:36.959]  That's all Agenda 21.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.361]  Global corporate fraud through the UN.
[00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:42.696]  It's all coming up today.
[00:09:43.277 --> 00:09:45.658]  Now, first off, let's get to this story.
[00:09:45.698 --> 00:09:48.080]  I first saw this on Friday up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.501]  It's an AP story.
[00:09:49.541 --> 00:09:53.824]  We've got it up on InfoWars.com, linked on the Sunday broadcast so folks can see it.
[00:09:54.264 --> 00:10:00.489]  CDC confirms first case of MERS virus in America.
[00:10:01.573 --> 00:10:08.395]  Health officials say a deadly virus from the Middle East has turned up for the first time in the United States.
[00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:17.958]  An American who works as a healthcare worker in Saudi Arabia is hospitalized in Indiana with the MERS virus that kills a large portion of those that get it.
[00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:24.560]  Officials said Friday the man was diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome after returning to the U.S.
[00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:25.321]  about a week ago.
[00:10:26.354 --> 00:10:30.735]  Saudi Arabia has been the center of an outbreak of MERS, which surfaced two years ago.
[00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:34.496]  At least 400 cases have been reported in more than a hundred people.
[00:10:35.216 --> 00:10:36.536]  It kills more than one in four!
[00:10:36.556 --> 00:10:37.497]  That's super deadly!
[00:10:38.197 --> 00:10:39.917]  And more than a hundred people have died!
[00:10:39.937 --> 00:10:42.218]  The virus has been found in camels!
[00:10:42.978 --> 00:10:45.739]  But officials don't know how it's jumped into humans.
[00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:47.399]  Well, I've got a good idea.
[00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:55.141]  When you've got hundreds of animals that have been zoologically crossed with humans, or other animals, and that's been done,
[00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:57.682]  For pig hearts, for transplanting things.
[00:10:58.003 --> 00:10:59.364]  It allows it to jump into humans.
[00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:01.846]  That's what the top geneticists have said on this show, as the literature says.
[00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:18.380]  When you've got hundreds of pharmacological crops, with scores, more than dozens, of different plants and animals, including human DNA, put into their DNA, and then virus RNA added, you're looking at cross-species contamination, where we can get the diseases that the animals have.
[00:11:20.196 --> 00:11:27.463]  In fact, most scientists believe that Ebola, until the last 50 years because of vaccines in Africa, wasn't able to jump into humans or HIV.
[00:11:29.104 --> 00:11:31.466]  This is the type of garbage we're talking about.
[00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.289]  Airborne Ebola.
[00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:36.071]  Airborne rabies.
[00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:38.113]  We're talking about zombie level events.
[00:11:39.858 --> 00:11:41.479]  That the system is talking about.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.743]  And then you've got GMO, you've got all the feeding antibiotics to the farm animals.
[00:11:46.323 --> 00:11:51.667]  All of this is souping up the bacteria and souping up the viruses with the antivirals they've got.
[00:11:52.328 --> 00:12:06.799]  Just earlier last week, it was like last Monday, like seven, eight days ago, the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, and the WHO, World Health Organization, not the British Rock Band, they came out and said the number one medical threat worldwide, and I agree with them,
[00:12:07.874 --> 00:12:11.219]  Is superbugs flesh-eating bacteria?
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.443]  Staph and strep and the rest of it.
[00:12:14.944 --> 00:12:16.326]  You don't have to tell me that.
[00:12:16.366 --> 00:12:18.168]  I've talked to medical doctors all over the country.
[00:12:18.976 --> 00:12:21.137]  Last winter, I lost my cousin and my uncle.
[00:12:21.177 --> 00:12:22.398]  My uncle took care of my cousin.
[00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:25.960]  My uncle took care of my cousin, and then he ended up getting it and dying.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.461]  It was some respiratory thing.
[00:12:27.501 --> 00:12:33.084]  The hospital in East Texas was full, turning people away, and so were all the others, and people were dying all over the place.
[00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:34.064]  And you know what?
[00:12:34.084 --> 00:12:35.005]  It wasn't in the media.
[00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:41.428]  It was in a few local stories around the country that there were all these deaths and all these problems, but the establishment didn't want you to know.
[00:12:41.908 --> 00:12:44.790]  Oh, and there's some fake H1N1 that's really not even killing anybody.
[00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.911]  And that the vaccine doubles your chances of getting regular flu.
[00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:49.511]  That was a Canadian study, government study.
[00:12:49.932 --> 00:12:54.253]  You'll hear all about it because it's a rollout to sell $20 million of flu shot.
[00:12:55.093 --> 00:12:58.074]  But when it's real, and it's killing people.
[00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:04.437]  Remember a few years ago they had like super flu in vials in a FedEx truck that crashed in Denver.
[00:13:04.457 --> 00:13:10.859]  It was all over the road and one drop of it, you know, would have basically given people flu that was killing 90% of people that got it.
[00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:15.741]  Made in a lab, just search engine, governments make super flus in labs.
[00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:34.393]  And they claim they're doing it to fight stuff, but if you go back to the H1N1 outbreak in 2000, and what was it, 8 or 9, if you go back to that, it was in Bloomberg even, that in Eastern European countries, like Czech Republic, one headline was, 20 homeless die from being given a flu shot.
[00:13:35.233 --> 00:13:38.696]  And it turned out it was a super weasel flu crossed with humans.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:50.305]  And so, this is the type of mad scientist crazy land stuff that's going on that is so incredibly important.
[00:13:50.325 --> 00:13:52.446]  And we need to understand, the threat is not terrorism.
[00:13:52.686 --> 00:14:00.631]  Terrorism is hyped up in movies and TV, both fiction and non-fiction, to create the perception that it's happening and at record levels.
[00:14:02.072 --> 00:14:02.852]  That's what's going on.
[00:14:03.733 --> 00:14:05.093]  Again, I've said this a thousand times.
[00:14:05.153 --> 00:14:07.575]  Vanity Fair wrote an article about it last year.
[00:14:09.577 --> 00:14:10.378]  No, it was Esquire.
[00:14:10.538 --> 00:14:12.299]  Only reason I know is because I was in that issue of Esquire.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.360]  Only reason I read it.
[00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:16.303]  And they did the same numbers I've done at Nauseum.
[00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:18.845]  Two hundred and something deaths from honeybees on average.
[00:14:18.865 --> 00:14:20.026]  Two hundred and something deaths from wasps.
[00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.067]  Similar numbers.
[00:14:22.089 --> 00:14:26.892]  It's over 300 deaths a year of deer actually running out in front of cars.
[00:14:26.972 --> 00:14:29.114]  Dozens of deaths where deer actually gore people to death.
[00:14:29.154 --> 00:14:31.395]  That's not really popular and promoted, but it's true.
[00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:36.279]  Four to five deaths a year from great white sharks.
[00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:37.219]  Everybody's scared of those.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.941]  It's just like terrorism.
[00:14:39.341 --> 00:14:41.002]  Terrorism is incredibly rare.
[00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:44.905]  Incredibly hard to get killed by real terrorism or even fake terrorism.
[00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:46.606]  You know, the stage provocateur stuff.
[00:14:49.178 --> 00:14:57.123]  But when the government funds Al-Qaeda to take over Syria and kills 300,000 people now, it's loving and liberal and they're just nice little rebels that they're giving heat-seeking missiles to.
[00:14:57.183 --> 00:15:04.128]  But the reason I get into this is, our whole world's being changed and police state's being set up for the security of the criminal class that's taken over.
[00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:18.493]  Not to fight supposed terrorists, but statistically, the numbers vary, but as many as 300 plus thousand people, they estimate, die a year in the United States from hospital infections.
[00:15:19.033 --> 00:15:21.294]  Another 200,000 from bad drug interactions.
[00:15:21.614 --> 00:15:27.275]  The CDC's own website has bad drug interactions and bad prescriptions as the number three killer.
[00:15:28.655 --> 00:15:29.935]  I mean, this is a fact, folks.
[00:15:30.836 --> 00:15:31.756]  I believe it's number one.
[00:15:32.785 --> 00:15:38.612]  And so, hundreds of thousands dead from flesh-eating bacteria and hospital infections, hey, that's no big deal.
[00:15:39.173 --> 00:15:40.074]  That's not a problem.
[00:15:41.075 --> 00:15:44.839]  But let me tell you, less than a hundred people, U.S.
[00:15:44.859 --> 00:15:47.703]  citizens dying from terrorism a year, you'd think it was the end of the world.
[00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:52.214]  Just like as I always say, great whites kill five people a year on average.
[00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:52.634]  Look it up.
[00:15:53.014 --> 00:15:53.895]  The record's 14.
[00:15:54.695 --> 00:16:00.118]  Everybody I know, almost everybody, will not get in the water, even in the Caribbean, because they think a great white shark is in there.
[00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:02.900]  And there aren't great white sharks in the Caribbean, boys and girls.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.662]  There are hammerheads and other little creatures.
[00:16:09.855 --> 00:16:18.859]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:16:18.939 --> 00:16:26.982]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:16:27.342 --> 00:16:32.024]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:16:32.204 --> 00:16:38.926]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:16:39.006 --> 00:16:46.089]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:53.031]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:16:53.191 --> 00:16:57.555]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:16:57.675 --> 00:17:00.937]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:17:01.077 --> 00:17:07.202]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:17:07.383 --> 00:17:09.604]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:17:10.105 --> 00:17:17.991]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:20.253]  All the major networks are state-runs.
[00:17:20.433 --> 00:17:23.075]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:17:23.135 --> 00:17:27.539]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:30.701]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:17:30.721 --> 00:17:38.027]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:17:38.207 --> 00:17:42.370]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.212]  We are the true media.
[00:17:44.312 --> 00:17:46.914]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:17:46.974 --> 00:17:50.618]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[00:18:10.017 --> 00:18:14.020]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.203]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:18:18.423 --> 00:18:21.826]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:18:22.086 --> 00:18:24.968]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:18:25.128 --> 00:18:32.473]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:18:32.693 --> 00:18:36.336]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:18:36.596 --> 00:18:40.837]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:18:41.018 --> 00:18:46.940]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.781]  Fluoride, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:53.462]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:18:53.662 --> 00:18:55.022]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:18:55.162 --> 00:18:56.403]  It's time to take action.
[00:18:56.543 --> 00:18:58.243]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:19:05.746 --> 00:19:08.769]  Our call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:12.233]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement.
[00:19:12.413 --> 00:19:14.455]  A lot of you asked me to come speak in your town or city.
[00:19:14.675 --> 00:19:20.341]  I would love to, but I'm so busy here in the trenches at the Infowars Demand Center, I'm just unable to travel.
[00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:29.630]  When my friends at Stansbury Research, one of the top analyst firms in the world, invited me to be part of a special one-day event in Dallas, Texas, I could not say no.
[00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:37.513]  You will hear from true experts like Porter Stansbury, T. Boone Pickens, Cactus Schroeder, Bill Murphy, Van Simmons, and myself, Alex Jones.
[00:19:37.973 --> 00:19:40.634]  I will be speaking on the fact that history is happening now.
[00:19:40.735 --> 00:19:44.576]  We are now at a critical juncture where more happens in a month than happened in the previous 10 years.
[00:19:44.936 --> 00:19:50.158]  I will also be breaking down the fact that a moral society is the only truly prosperous and safe society.
[00:19:50.358 --> 00:19:51.119]  May 31st.
[00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:52.119]  It's one day.
[00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:53.980]  The tickets will sell out.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.602]  Simply visit AlexJonesDallas.com or follow the banners at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:59.102 --> 00:20:03.704]  I have secured a discount for my listeners when you visit AlexJonesDallas.com.
[00:20:03.844 --> 00:20:09.267]  Again, that's AlexJonesDallas.com to secure your tickets for this one-time event, and I'll see you in Dallas.
[00:20:10.727 --> 00:20:11.888]  Coast to Coast.
[00:20:12.268 --> 00:20:13.609]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:14.309 --> 00:20:18.411]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:24.553 --> 00:20:25.434]  Oh, that's a pretty song.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.842]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:32.282 --> 00:20:34.084]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:34.144 --> 00:20:37.186]  It's the time of the season.
[00:20:39.528 --> 00:20:41.569]  When the blood runs high.
[00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.711]  In this time.
[00:20:44.231 --> 00:20:45.833]  Give it to me easy.
[00:20:47.874 --> 00:20:51.697]  And let me try with pleasured hands.
[00:20:52.198 --> 00:20:53.819]  To take you in the sun.
[00:20:59.665 --> 00:21:02.406]  That's the zombies bringing us in.
[00:21:03.267 --> 00:21:06.689]  Of course, they're not the kind of zombies the Pentagon wants to create.
[00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.211]  You know they want robots to replace humans.
[00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:13.192]  That's already been announced.
[00:21:14.344 --> 00:21:15.165]  In the military.
[00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:16.526]  At every level.
[00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:21.450]  But what about making humans hybrids?
[00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:30.917]  Just like the new Robocop?
[00:21:31.398 --> 00:21:33.239]  Well, that's the next story I want to get into.
[00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:36.021]  Then we're going to get into the latest covert attack on the Second Amendment.
[00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:36.862]  Well, it's kind of overt.
[00:21:37.703 --> 00:21:38.724]  Then we're going to get into...
[00:21:40.458 --> 00:21:44.060]  The latest edition of Infowars Magazine titled 1776 Part Deux.
[00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:48.663]  And then we were going to get into some of the fraudulent statistics out there.
[00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:52.745]  Speaking of that, on Friday's show, I'm going to see if I can still find that piece of paper from Friday.
[00:21:52.805 --> 00:21:53.165]  Here it is.
[00:21:54.826 --> 00:21:58.648]  We had a vote on air over two hours of the three-hour show with the callers.
[00:21:59.048 --> 00:22:01.750]  Who was the biggest con artist the last 20 years, the biggest BS-er?
[00:22:02.824 --> 00:22:19.519]  Because we've got Jay Carney, maybe we can cue that up for the next segment, we've got Jay Carney running around the White House as a disinformation officer, saying that, oh, the stuff that says we covered up Benghazi, the memo, we got caught lying about, that says, you know, talking points Benghazi, it doesn't refer to Benghazi.
[00:22:19.539 --> 00:22:28.628]  Sounds like if you're in the grocery store and it says milk on the aisle, and you walk up and there's milk there, but you go, this doesn't refer to milk.
[00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:39.486]  Or if you're driving by and you see a store that says, Guns and Ammo, you pull over and go, I want guns and ammo, and they go, oh, sorry sir, this doesn't refer to guns and ammo, but I see guns and ammo through the window.
[00:22:39.526 --> 00:22:42.227]  Well, you're being a little bit of a conspiracy terrorist.
[00:22:42.607 --> 00:22:45.668]  Carney said it's a conspiracy theory that Benghazi even exists.
[00:22:45.688 --> 00:22:48.229]  He said, it's a conspiracy theory of a conspiracy theory.
[00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:55.831]  So we had a vote, and callers nominated, Piers Morgan is a liar, Bill Clinton, Obama, Baghdad Bob, Satan,
[00:22:57.318 --> 00:23:10.148]  Corrupt preachers that go along with the system, Mayor Bloomberg, Hitler, Hillary Clinton, George Soros, Eric Holder, Janet Yellen, Glenn Beck for whatever reason, and it just kept coming up, I don't want to fight with Glenn, that's who people voted for.
[00:23:10.668 --> 00:23:15.572]  Glenn kind of apologized last week for making stuff up about us and said he wants to be nice, so that's fine, I'm friendly.
[00:23:16.313 --> 00:23:17.934]  Just to get that out there, and then the FBI.
[00:23:20.692 --> 00:23:21.412]  FBI got one.
[00:23:21.852 --> 00:23:22.812]  Glenn Beck got two.
[00:23:22.852 --> 00:23:25.093]  Janet Yellen got one vote.
[00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:26.113]  That's ahead of the Federal Reserve.
[00:23:26.133 --> 00:23:27.613]  It's not federal, so that's a fraud right there.
[00:23:27.653 --> 00:23:28.654]  Eric Holder got four votes.
[00:23:28.674 --> 00:23:29.414]  He was in second place.
[00:23:29.754 --> 00:23:30.634]  George Soros got one.
[00:23:30.674 --> 00:23:31.554]  Mayor Bloomberg got one.
[00:23:31.594 --> 00:23:32.494]  Hitler, he got two.
[00:23:33.175 --> 00:23:34.215]  Bad Preachers got one.
[00:23:34.275 --> 00:23:35.095]  Satan got one.
[00:23:35.155 --> 00:23:36.315]  Baghdad Bob got one.
[00:23:36.335 --> 00:23:37.996]  Remember the guy that said that the U.S.
[00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:40.096]  had been defeated in Iraq when bombs were going off behind him?
[00:23:40.716 --> 00:23:41.096]  And the U.S.
[00:23:41.136 --> 00:23:41.936]  wasn't anywhere in Iraq?
[00:23:41.996 --> 00:23:43.257]  That's Jay Carney-level baloney.
[00:23:43.617 --> 00:23:47.317]  Obama got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight votes.
[00:23:47.377 --> 00:23:48.338]  Bill Clinton only got one.
[00:23:48.378 --> 00:23:49.138]  Piers Morgan got one.
[00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:59.432]  Obama is the grand supreme fraudster scam artist joke, according to our illustrious listeners.
[00:23:59.632 --> 00:24:04.234]  And so that's the first annual 2014 that will be held on May 2nd every year.
[00:24:04.254 --> 00:24:11.818]  The global Baghdad Bob comical con artist fraudster award.
[00:24:13.739 --> 00:24:15.440]  If you got your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.780]  I never said you could keep your doctor.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.221]  If you got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:20.907]  Everything is wonderful.
[00:24:21.327 --> 00:24:23.550]  Everything is awesome when you're part of a team.
[00:24:25.472 --> 00:24:26.533]  Oh, I'm so trendy.
[00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:29.997]  I mean, Obama is a fascist New World Order frontman.
[00:24:30.805 --> 00:24:33.848]  And the Republican leadership is protecting him, saying, we are the board.
[00:24:34.049 --> 00:24:35.050]  We will assimilate you.
[00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.551]  Obamacare is here to stay.
[00:24:36.752 --> 00:24:38.473]  We don't care if 80 plus percent are against it.
[00:24:38.654 --> 00:24:39.575]  This is the way it is.
[00:24:39.635 --> 00:24:42.838]  I mean, it's just, man, that Alex Jones is a crazy kook, man.
[00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:50.807]  You know, he was pointing out that the former press secretary said there was no drone program, even though it existed 10 years before he was even press secretary.
[00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.351]  And then later Gibbs admits it was all a fraud.
[00:24:54.391 --> 00:24:57.234]  I mean, it's just like, we're not buying billions of bullets.
[00:24:57.474 --> 00:24:58.715]  We're not setting up checkpoints.
[00:24:58.915 --> 00:25:00.377]  We're not spying on you with the NSA.
[00:25:00.397 --> 00:25:01.077]  We're not doing anything.
[00:25:01.338 --> 00:25:02.599]  There's no employer mandate.
[00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:03.319]  There's no $5,000 fine.
[00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:04.160]  Uh-uh, uh-uh.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:10.526]  I mean, if you told me there was no Santa Claus, I would believe it.
[00:25:11.146 --> 00:25:12.287]  That's kind of what Obama is, though.
[00:25:12.307 --> 00:25:16.131]  It's like telling somebody, a three-year-old, that Santa Claus doesn't exist.
[00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:17.132]  They don't want to hear it.
[00:25:18.373 --> 00:25:24.737]  Now I want to get to this next really big piece of news that ties in with the medical news we covered last segment about these superbugs.
[00:25:25.418 --> 00:25:30.041]  Now it's only a matter of time until the already biggest threat killing 300,000 Americans a year.
[00:25:30.221 --> 00:25:31.382]  God knows what is worldwide.
[00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:35.180]  I mean, in fact, look up that number, maybe, guys, from the World Health Organization.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.621]  Number of people estimated to die from superbugs.
[00:25:38.681 --> 00:25:43.563]  I bet it's in the tens of millions out of seven and a half billion, but who knows they even have a number on that.
[00:25:43.603 --> 00:25:45.504]  It's all dead reckoning anyways.
[00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:48.344]  It's only a matter of time until this stuff really gets out there.
[00:25:48.945 --> 00:25:58.268]  And that's why I have, and it's not perfect, but when I've had chest colds and stuff that antibiotics won't knock out, like I had this year, I had the stuff that killed my uncle and my cousin.
[00:25:58.908 --> 00:26:01.091]  Probably got it when I was there taking care of my uncle in the hospital.
[00:26:01.892 --> 00:26:05.376]  I just did it by drinking heroic dosages of colloidal silver.
[00:26:05.396 --> 00:26:10.141]  And we've come up with our own super brand of colloidal silver at InfoWarsLife.com called Silver Bullet.
[00:26:10.161 --> 00:26:12.044]  If you want to support the broadcast and get that.
[00:26:12.084 --> 00:26:16.369]  I'm not saying it will fix everything, but topically or internally, everybody knows what silver does.
[00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:17.610]  The ancient antibiotic.
[00:26:18.356 --> 00:26:27.820]  You know, the old pilgrims used to, or the travelers in the western wagons would put those coins into their milk and then put it down in a root cellar, but it would make the milk last longer.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.241]  The silver coins are putting silver on a newborn baby's belly.
[00:26:31.261 --> 00:26:34.482]  I mean, they didn't know what it was doing.
[00:26:34.662 --> 00:26:36.283]  They hadn't even found microbes yet.
[00:26:38.024 --> 00:26:39.084]  They just knew it worked.
[00:26:39.124 --> 00:26:42.625]  Well, we've got the best nano silver out there, Infowarslife.com.
[00:26:42.926 --> 00:26:46.027]  I didn't mean to plug that, but I'm like, why not plug something we sell
[00:26:47.259 --> 00:27:01.419]  If we're talking about a major crisis and something that's going on and happening, and while I'm at that, I don't ever go speak a lot because I can talk to millions on the radio every day and it's much more focused and I can have all my documentation with me and I've got all this crew and a nightly news program and we're busy.
[00:27:02.293 --> 00:27:03.214]  I love to speak to crowds.
[00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:05.876]  I give great speeches, I'm told, better than on the radio.
[00:27:06.577 --> 00:27:08.739]  But I don't do it, but maybe once a year because I'm so busy.
[00:27:09.199 --> 00:27:12.362]  Well, I've agreed to speak in Dallas, my old hometown, May 31st.
[00:27:12.462 --> 00:27:16.285]  It's an all-day event put on by Stansbury Research Investment Conference.
[00:27:16.845 --> 00:27:24.392]  And folks, T. Boone Pickens is going to be speaking, the billionaire, Porter Stansbury, top analyst, Cactus Schroeder, Bill Murphy, Van Simons, and more.
[00:27:24.892 --> 00:27:26.494]  I am the featured speaker.
[00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.171]  But the keynote, they've all got names.
[00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.412]  I don't care if I was number one or not.
[00:27:31.432 --> 00:27:32.793]  I'm really number 200 T-Boone Pickens.
[00:27:33.194 --> 00:27:33.534]  That's fine.
[00:27:33.554 --> 00:27:35.055]  I look forward to hearing T-Boone Pickens speak.
[00:27:35.415 --> 00:27:36.536]  That's going to be weird.
[00:27:36.856 --> 00:27:40.119]  The point is, is that this is a big event.
[00:27:40.139 --> 00:27:41.139]  It's a one-day event.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.260]  It's at a really nice place.
[00:27:42.701 --> 00:27:49.966]  You can check it out, find out more at InfoWars.com on the banners, or AlexJonesDallas.com.
[00:27:50.346 --> 00:27:52.028]  AlexJonesDallas.com.
[00:27:52.388 --> 00:27:54.109]  Or go to the Stansbury website, find their number.
[00:27:54.129 --> 00:27:55.650]  You can call them there if you want to get tickets that way.
[00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.811]  But my listeners get a 25% discount
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.402]  Off of the price of this elite news analyst investment conference.
[00:28:04.562 --> 00:28:05.462]  And this is it.
[00:28:05.662 --> 00:28:08.964]  I may not speak again all year, so here it is if you want to go.
[00:28:10.044 --> 00:28:13.005]  Okay, Big D, Dallas Tejas.
[00:28:13.206 --> 00:28:13.806]  I will be there.
[00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:14.406]  The 31st.
[00:28:14.446 --> 00:28:18.788]  I don't know, I guess that's like 26 days away, or do the math.
[00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:20.535]  So you don't wanna miss that.
[00:28:20.555 --> 00:28:22.657]  All right, how long do I have till we go to break?
[00:28:22.697 --> 00:28:23.597]  Just a few minutes here.
[00:28:24.358 --> 00:28:25.939]  I wanna get started on this right now.
[00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:27.740]  We're gonna come back and talk about it more in the next segment.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.560]  It's a big deal.
[00:28:29.121 --> 00:28:33.063]  Coming soon, a brain implant to restore memory.
[00:28:34.724 --> 00:28:38.826]  Now, again, I learned about this 15 years ago from public DARPA and MIT research.
[00:28:40.507 --> 00:28:41.588]  All right, there's the bell.
[00:28:42.949 --> 00:28:43.629]  And I warned you.
[00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:46.491]  Then I started learning five years ago, they're already putting it in some troops' brains.
[00:28:47.731 --> 00:29:04.407]  Then about a year ago it was finally in the DARPA news, their MIT, showing TRIPS, I couldn't find the article the day before the show, like something out of the Manchurian Candidate with Denzel Washington, the remake, in the chair with the wires in the back of their head, and they're literally now moving forward to brain chip the TRIPS.
[00:29:05.107 --> 00:29:06.949]  And it's in AP, Reuters, you name it.
[00:29:07.209 --> 00:29:08.491]  We're going to cover it when we come back.
[00:29:09.764 --> 00:29:12.345]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:29:12.605 --> 00:29:17.467]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:29:17.728 --> 00:29:25.611]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:30.153]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:34.195]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:29:34.335 --> 00:29:40.040]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.062]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:29:43.463 --> 00:29:48.687]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:29:48.827 --> 00:29:56.954]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:29:57.014 --> 00:29:57.194]  That's 866-229-0927.

[00:30:09.601 --> 00:30:15.723]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:30:15.743 --> 00:30:19.024]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:30:19.044 --> 00:30:20.784]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:30:20.844 --> 00:30:27.106]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:30:27.186 --> 00:30:33.088]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:30:33.248 --> 00:30:36.990]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:30:37.191 --> 00:30:40.092]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:30:40.152 --> 00:30:48.298]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:30:48.558 --> 00:30:50.599]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:30:50.659 --> 00:30:51.680]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:31:00.805]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:31:09.318 --> 00:31:12.660]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:14.982]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:31:15.182 --> 00:31:23.468]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:31:23.769 --> 00:31:33.976]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:31:34.316 --> 00:31:47.742]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:48.123 --> 00:31:55.466]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose for a limited time.

[00:32:09.542 --> 00:32:13.544]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:17.707]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:32:17.927 --> 00:32:21.349]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:24.491]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:32.016]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:35.858]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:40.359]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:32:40.539 --> 00:32:46.461]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:32:46.501 --> 00:32:50.302]  Fluoride, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:32:50.442 --> 00:32:52.983]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:32:53.183 --> 00:32:54.543]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:32:54.683 --> 00:32:55.923]  It's time to take action.
[00:32:56.064 --> 00:32:57.704]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:33:10.709 --> 00:33:11.869]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.590]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:17.512]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:24.372 --> 00:33:28.555]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:33:29.195 --> 00:33:30.015]  You want answers?
[00:33:30.796 --> 00:33:31.636]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:32.417 --> 00:33:35.859]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:36.519 --> 00:33:40.582]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33:42.063 --> 00:33:43.184]  Let's make this a year of action.
[00:33:43.484 --> 00:33:44.724]  That's what most Americans want.
[00:33:44.944 --> 00:33:47.365]  Raising the debt ceiling does not increase our debt.
[00:33:47.666 --> 00:33:49.586]  Nobody is listening to your telephone calls.
[00:33:49.706 --> 00:33:50.727]  The debate is settled.
[00:33:51.047 --> 00:33:52.428]  Climate change is a fact.
[00:33:52.468 --> 00:34:01.271]  And if people can't trust not only the executive branch, but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges, then we're going to have some problems.
[00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:03.753]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:34:08.018 --> 00:34:09.602]  Oh my gosh, I love Obamacare!
[00:34:09.622 --> 00:34:12.107]  I love being an idiot!
[00:34:12.127 --> 00:34:12.468]  Pride.
[00:34:19.238 --> 00:34:28.661]  I was looking at a photo up on Infowars.com just during the break in the rotating tile up there of stories, and it was Jay Carney throwing his head back laughing with Obama.
[00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:30.201]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:34:30.761 --> 00:34:31.481]  It's so funny.
[00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:34.402]  We say everyone's able to sign up, Obamacare works great.
[00:34:35.162 --> 00:34:39.244]  Oh, we tell them that there's no energy deals to run scams.
[00:34:39.384 --> 00:34:41.364]  Oh, we tell people you can keep your doctor.
[00:34:41.384 --> 00:34:43.745]  Oh, we tell people you didn't build your business.
[00:34:44.525 --> 00:34:52.156]  They just go on with lie after lie after lie after lie after lie and the Republican leadership run by John Boehner.
[00:34:53.652 --> 00:34:56.815]  Says you cannot get rid of Obamacare, it's here to stay, but we'll tweak a few things in it.
[00:34:56.895 --> 00:34:58.216]  No, we want it gone.
[00:34:58.256 --> 00:35:01.318]  It's criminal, it's disgusting, it's wrecking the country.
[00:35:01.598 --> 00:35:06.162]  But they want us dependent and they make money off the corporate tax that goes directly to them.
[00:35:06.702 --> 00:35:07.723]  So here's that headline.
[00:35:08.464 --> 00:35:09.625]  Carney on Benghazi.
[00:35:09.665 --> 00:35:13.347]  This is a conspiracy theory looking for a conspiracy theory.
[00:35:13.888 --> 00:35:22.354]  And in a larger context, he's saying the memo about the cover-up of Benghazi and about talking points, it does not have to do with
[00:35:23.075 --> 00:35:23.996]  Benghazi.
[00:35:24.897 --> 00:35:25.718]  I'm gonna say that again.
[00:35:28.321 --> 00:35:29.442]  You didn't build that business.
[00:35:29.843 --> 00:35:30.684]  Somebody else did that.
[00:35:32.153 --> 00:35:33.334]  Your kids belong to the state.
[00:35:33.995 --> 00:35:40.440]  This is just absolutely waging war on reality, waging war on the truth, waging war on sanity.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.801]  This is mind control.
[00:35:42.501 --> 00:35:44.103]  Let's go to Hare Carney.
[00:35:44.663 --> 00:35:47.485]  Like, this is a conspiracy theory, a conspiracy.
[00:35:47.505 --> 00:35:50.608]  A conservative group comes in and says, we want Benghazi documents.
[00:35:50.988 --> 00:35:54.191]  The administration says, this is not a Benghazi document, so we're not turning it over, right?
[00:35:54.231 --> 00:35:58.074]  Again, I don't, like, this is a State Department FOIA request, response.
[00:35:58.875 --> 00:35:59.015]  Yeah.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:09.363]  And we played the clip on Friday too, we've got it there, where he says, it's all over the news, he says, this is not a Benghazi document, when it says it's a Benghazi document, and that's what they're talking about.
[00:36:09.664 --> 00:36:14.505]  First they said there were no documents, now this came out, they say it's a real document, but not a Benghazi document.
[00:36:16.126 --> 00:36:23.449]  That'd be like if you walked on a Chevy dealership, and walked over to a Corvette, and you said, I want to buy that Corvette, and they go, that is not a Corvette.
[00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:26.910]  And you said, yeah, it's a red Corvette, or it's a black Corvette, no it's not.
[00:36:28.516 --> 00:36:29.837]  Or I liken it to the milk aisle.
[00:36:29.877 --> 00:36:36.403]  It says milk, there's milk, and somebody walks over and says, you're not getting milk out of the refrigerator, out of the cold case.
[00:36:36.463 --> 00:36:36.984]  Yes, I am.
[00:36:37.024 --> 00:36:37.424]  No, you're not.
[00:36:37.484 --> 00:36:37.824]  No, you're not.
[00:36:37.844 --> 00:36:38.365]  You're crazy.
[00:36:38.665 --> 00:36:39.686]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:36:40.006 --> 00:36:41.468]  That's called gaslighting.
[00:36:41.848 --> 00:36:42.188]  Look it up.
[00:36:42.228 --> 00:36:44.050]  It's a psychological warfare technique.
[00:36:45.852 --> 00:36:49.395]  Now, when the baloney, when the BS won't work anymore, what do they go to?
[00:36:50.255 --> 00:36:51.316]  It was in the news two weeks ago.
[00:36:52.179 --> 00:36:57.841]  That the Air Force and the Navy are going to completely pilotless aircraft that are self-autonomous.
[00:36:58.361 --> 00:37:02.783]  They're already in the air, but by 2020 all of them and the flight crews will be robots.
[00:37:03.163 --> 00:37:05.804]  And robots will work on the robots, and that's the big goal.
[00:37:06.384 --> 00:37:13.686]  China's putting in the robots to get rid of people at Foxconn with the suicide nets, the forced abortions, the suicide vans, all of it.
[00:37:15.267 --> 00:37:16.087]  I'm not making this up.
[00:37:16.127 --> 00:37:17.508]  I just said suicide nets and
[00:37:20.146 --> 00:37:21.027]  Execution vans.
[00:37:21.087 --> 00:37:22.248]  Look up those terms.
[00:37:22.328 --> 00:37:23.949]  I mean, this is real.
[00:37:24.949 --> 00:37:27.131]  And I'm freaking out, not because I'm the weirdo.
[00:37:27.571 --> 00:37:31.394]  I'm freaking out because I'm normal and something's got to be done.
[00:37:31.934 --> 00:37:33.956]  Our government doesn't even criticize China now.
[00:37:34.356 --> 00:37:38.219]  Our supposed corporations have moved to China and are de-industrializing this country.
[00:37:39.949 --> 00:37:41.269]  And we are replacing humans.
[00:37:41.289 --> 00:37:43.670]  Google cars are hitting the streets in all 50 states.
[00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.590]  They're going to replace humans.
[00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:49.732]  Then they're going to make humans have Google cars or computer cars saying they're safer.
[00:37:50.012 --> 00:37:51.813]  I've been saying that for 15 years plus.
[00:37:52.413 --> 00:37:53.773]  First few years I wasn't that smart on air.
[00:37:54.213 --> 00:37:55.934]  Now it's being announced on TV.
[00:37:56.434 --> 00:37:58.715]  Will it be the law that you're not allowed to drive your car?
[00:37:59.515 --> 00:38:02.416]  Or will you be allowed to drive some but the computer takes over if you make a mistake?
[00:38:02.816 --> 00:38:04.157]  That's already coming out with Toyota.
[00:38:04.557 --> 00:38:05.817]  This is smart meters.
[00:38:05.977 --> 00:38:07.098]  All of it is total control.
[00:38:07.358 --> 00:38:08.278]  But the next level
[00:38:10.393 --> 00:38:14.256]  Is space planes, robotic control, that's already in space on record.
[00:38:15.677 --> 00:38:20.240]  Undersea submarines that are drone.
[00:38:21.021 --> 00:38:28.666]  Drone ships, drone aircraft, and drone 18-wheeler systems that deliver combat robots, drone tanks, that's decades old.
[00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:30.107]  It's all being rolled out right now.
[00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:36.152]  But just like the movie RoboCop, the new one is so accurate to how things really work,
[00:38:36.943 --> 00:38:41.966]  They want the human body because biomechanically it works better than even the latest machines they've got.
[00:38:42.567 --> 00:38:44.928]  And so they're now saying we might grow humanoids.
[00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:46.169]  This is an MIT, look it up.
[00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:53.934]  We might grow humanoids that don't have a brain but have a human body with computers in it, basically a replicant.
[00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:55.330]  A.K.A.
[00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:00.033]  Philip K. Dick, show that then we have the combat mechs we need.
[00:39:00.053 --> 00:39:18.701]  They're saying that's the latest in biotech and nanotech is taking stuff and calling it, calling it an invention, but really it's an abomination of life that again creates all this cross-species genetic leakage, which major studies you can look up show just the GMO crops are already leeching into human DNA and causing deadly mutations in humans.
[00:39:19.102 --> 00:39:21.002]  Cancer in children is only up 10,000% the last 50 years.
[00:39:21.022 --> 00:39:21.423]  Why not another 10,000%?
[00:39:24.324 --> 00:39:25.004]  Breast cancer is up 3,000%.
[00:39:25.284 --> 00:39:26.605]  How about more?
[00:39:26.885 --> 00:39:28.145]  No one wants to find the cure.
[00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:31.806]  Oh, I guess you do want to find the cure.
[00:39:32.226 --> 00:39:33.506]  The cure, the cure, the cure.
[00:39:33.726 --> 00:39:34.246]  No, you don't.
[00:39:34.446 --> 00:39:37.647]  The cure is finding out why it's exploding and why it's happening to begin with.
[00:39:38.147 --> 00:39:40.248]  The cure to lung cancer is stop smoking.
[00:39:41.688 --> 00:39:45.209]  The cure to not giving liver failure is don't drink two bottles of vodka every day.
[00:39:46.561 --> 00:39:47.101]  You understand?
[00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:49.402]  No one's talking about where it's coming from.
[00:39:50.002 --> 00:39:52.063]  So now you've got all these traumatized soldiers.
[00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:54.644]  How do you roll out the government taking over the internet?
[00:39:54.664 --> 00:40:00.926]  You go, for police and homeland security, we have to have a new internet that's secure, and then you'll be forced onto it and tracked.
[00:40:00.946 --> 00:40:02.267]  You have no rights on that new one.
[00:40:02.467 --> 00:40:05.948]  Then they release bugs and worms to take down the old internet.
[00:40:06.348 --> 00:40:06.588]  Okay?
[00:40:06.728 --> 00:40:07.889]  That's all the official plan.
[00:40:08.209 --> 00:40:10.590]  Internet 2, at least 18 years old, look it up.
[00:40:11.474 --> 00:40:13.635]  Now it's being announced in Reuters, right here in front of me.
[00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:18.779]  Now here's the new one, coming soon, a brain implant to restore memory!
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.662]  French news agency, in the next few months, highly secretive U.S.
[00:40:23.722 --> 00:40:29.006]  researchers say they will unveil new advances towards developing a brain implant they developed decades ago.
[00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:32.728]  They had remote-controlled cockroaches in the 70s, remote-controlled rats in the 80s.
[00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:33.649]  I know.
[00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:36.792]  Because it's in the mainline scientific documentation.
[00:40:37.272 --> 00:40:44.379]  Developing a brain implant that could one day, don't worry, they always announce it the same way, this is far off, like next week, like ten years ago.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:57.171]  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA that brought you the loving internet, is forging ahead with a four-year plan to build a sophisticated memory stimulator as part of President Barack Obama.
[00:40:57.432 --> 00:40:58.633]  See, he'll be credited like
[00:41:00.004 --> 00:41:01.906]  Like Al Gore for the invention of the Internet.
[00:41:02.086 --> 00:41:05.389]  It had been around since the 70s when they first started building it internally.
[00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:15.397]  And then by the early 90s, he votes along with the rest of the Senate to increase funding so they would control what was already there, and then takes credit for inventing it.
[00:41:15.858 --> 00:41:17.739]  He also wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.583]  Did you know that he wrote the book of Leviticus as well?
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.943]  He also is hosting this radio show right now, and when I lifted weights this morning, he did that.
[00:41:27.963 --> 00:41:30.405]  Because, you know, if you lifted weights this morning, you didn't do that.
[00:41:30.865 --> 00:41:31.826]  Al Gore did that for you.
[00:41:32.406 --> 00:41:38.990]  The Defense Advanced Research Project, DARPA, is forging ahead with a four-year plan to build a sophisticated memory simulator.
[00:41:39.431 --> 00:41:47.376]  As part of President Barack Obama, if you don't take the brain chip, you're racist, 100 million initiative to better understand the human brain.
[00:41:49.295 --> 00:41:59.959]  The science has never been done before and raises ethical questions about whether the human mind should be manipulated in the name of staving off war injuries or managing the aging brain.
[00:41:59.979 --> 00:42:00.760]  See, oh, wait.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.281]  It's for troops.
[00:42:03.381 --> 00:42:04.201]  Aren't you for the troops?
[00:42:04.241 --> 00:42:05.061]  Let them have a brain chip.
[00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:06.182]  Or it's for the old.
[00:42:06.322 --> 00:42:07.703]  Or it's for your kid that's misbehaving.
[00:42:07.823 --> 00:42:12.945]  Or suddenly people are getting neurological disorders at a young age because of... We don't know why.
[00:42:12.965 --> 00:42:14.545]  We're not going to look into why everybody's getting sick.
[00:42:14.805 --> 00:42:17.987]  But don't worry, we have chips that will fix it.
[00:42:19.045 --> 00:42:21.106]  We have systems that will help you.
[00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:22.546]  We care.
[00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:24.527]  We want to help everyone.
[00:42:24.927 --> 00:42:26.428]  We have the answers.
[00:42:27.068 --> 00:42:34.391]  Take the chip that DARPA just developed when Obama pledged billions of dollars towards the program and a hundred million towards this.
[00:42:34.671 --> 00:42:36.592]  They haven't been working on it privately.
[00:42:36.652 --> 00:42:38.573]  It hasn't been admitted to be around for decades.
[00:42:39.313 --> 00:42:41.314]  Just search engine cockroach with microchip.
[00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:47.454]  I mean, I remember being a kid in the late 70s when my dad had science magazines showing the roaches.
[00:42:48.054 --> 00:42:51.917]  Not hypothetical, remote control with a chip on their head, remote control.
[00:42:53.198 --> 00:42:54.859]  Roborat was out in the early 90s.
[00:42:54.879 --> 00:42:57.321]  I remember seeing that, you know, 20 years ago.
[00:42:58.501 --> 00:43:00.122]  But, oh, it's brand new.
[00:43:00.803 --> 00:43:02.224]  Why not say Al Gore did it?
[00:43:02.364 --> 00:43:02.904]  Al Gore.
[00:43:02.944 --> 00:43:04.105]  He invented the brain chip.
[00:43:04.365 --> 00:43:05.086]  He invented Earth.
[00:43:05.426 --> 00:43:07.768]  Well, they're right back with more on this and what it really means.
[00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:16.996]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:43:17.096 --> 00:43:19.257]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:43:19.457 --> 00:43:24.641]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:43:24.822 --> 00:43:29.925]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:43:30.046 --> 00:43:33.148]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:43:33.428 --> 00:43:37.351]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:43:37.571 --> 00:43:41.874]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:43:41.954 --> 00:43:52.101]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:43:52.321 --> 00:43:56.684]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:43:56.784 --> 00:44:03.228]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:44:03.388 --> 00:44:09.094]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:44:09.174 --> 00:44:20.207]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:44:20.507 --> 00:44:22.349]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:23.229]  Fluoride.
[00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.010]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:44:25.351 --> 00:44:31.654]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:44:31.914 --> 00:44:34.756]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[00:44:34.876 --> 00:44:36.717]  And the results are on record.
[00:44:36.857 --> 00:44:42.961]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:44:43.161 --> 00:44:45.342]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:48.224]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:44:48.524 --> 00:44:51.886]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:44:52.026 --> 00:44:56.588]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:57.449 --> 00:45:02.251]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[00:45:02.551 --> 00:45:03.592]  I take it every day.
[00:45:03.752 --> 00:45:06.593]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:45:09.895 --> 00:45:17.738]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:45:18.019 --> 00:45:20.079]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:45:20.239 --> 00:45:22.861]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:45:22.941 --> 00:45:27.042]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:45:27.282 --> 00:45:30.504]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:45:30.524 --> 00:45:37.807]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:45:37.987 --> 00:45:42.109]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:43.989]  We are the true media.
[00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:46.690]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:50.452]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[00:46:09.873 --> 00:46:12.015]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement.
[00:46:12.195 --> 00:46:14.236]  A lot of you asked me to come speak in your town or city.
[00:46:14.456 --> 00:46:20.100]  I would love to, but I'm so busy here in the trenches at the Infowars Command Center, I'm just unable to travel.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:29.487]  When my friends at Stansbury Research, one of the top analyst firms in the world, invited me to be part of a special one-day event in Dallas, Texas, I could not say no.
[00:46:29.667 --> 00:46:37.312]  You will hear from true experts like Porter Stansbury, T. Boone Pickens, Cactus Schroeder, Bill Murphy, Van Simmons, and myself, Alex Jones.
[00:46:37.732 --> 00:46:40.393]  I will be speaking on the fact that history is happening now.
[00:46:40.413 --> 00:46:44.434]  We are now at a critical juncture where more happens in a month than happened in the previous 10 years.
[00:46:44.714 --> 00:46:49.955]  I will also be breaking down the fact that a moral society is the only truly prosperous and safe society.
[00:46:50.155 --> 00:46:50.915]  May 31st.
[00:46:51.075 --> 00:46:51.875]  It's one day.
[00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:53.736]  The tickets will sell out.
[00:46:54.056 --> 00:46:58.397]  Simply visit AlexJonesDallas.com or follow the banners at InfoWars.com.
[00:46:58.897 --> 00:47:03.520]  I have secured a discount for my listeners when you visit alexjonesdallas.com.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:09.063]  Again, that's alexjonesdallas.com to secure your tickets to this one-time event, and I'll see you in Dallas.
[00:47:10.664 --> 00:47:11.824]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:12.204 --> 00:47:13.585]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:14.246 --> 00:47:17.547]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:17.888 --> 00:47:25.152]  Ugh, we take you now live
[00:47:26.602 --> 00:47:30.666]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commencement.
[00:47:30.686 --> 00:47:31.126]  Is that an echo?
[00:47:32.167 --> 00:47:33.789]  In the heart of the resistance.
[00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:34.950]  Rallying patriots!
[00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.012]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:47:37.072 --> 00:47:37.292]  Yeah!
[00:47:37.312 --> 00:47:43.277]  Do you want this to be Alex Jones Show?
[00:47:50.031 --> 00:47:51.512]  Stand up and be counted!
[00:47:51.572 --> 00:47:56.034]  For what you are about to receive!
[00:47:56.115 --> 00:47:57.195]  We are the dealers!
[00:47:57.215 --> 00:48:00.157]  We give you everything you need!
[00:48:00.297 --> 00:48:04.379]  We are the dealers!
[00:48:04.459 --> 00:48:05.020]  Pick it up!
[00:48:09.362 --> 00:48:11.103]  Don't make it too late!
[00:48:11.123 --> 00:48:11.703]  We are the dealers!
[00:48:11.763 --> 00:48:12.584]  Right here's the best part!
[00:48:13.264 --> 00:48:14.005]  Let them have it!
[00:48:14.505 --> 00:48:15.746]  Full barrels!
[00:48:21.264 --> 00:48:23.146]  We are the pro-humans!
[00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:35.537]  Hold on to your culture and say no to the plastic New World Order.
[00:48:36.318 --> 00:48:41.082]  Because they want to overwrite all of humanity and enslave this powerful species.
[00:48:42.343 --> 00:48:44.145]  Yeah, we're just starting to fight.
[00:48:46.533 --> 00:48:49.757]  For those resisting the tyranny, we salute you!
[00:48:50.437 --> 00:48:57.225]  For those defending humanity from the parasites, we salute you!
[00:48:57.425 --> 00:48:58.105]  Yeah!
[00:48:59.227 --> 00:49:02.971]  We're rockin' on the front lines!
[00:49:11.121 --> 00:49:17.227]  This is an original transmission you're listening to right now on this second day.
[00:49:18.028 --> 00:49:20.911]  You know, I started getting really excited and yelling and stuff, and you know what?
[00:49:20.931 --> 00:49:22.493]  I'm just gonna let you know how I'm really feeling right now.
[00:49:22.513 --> 00:49:23.554]  I love humanity.
[00:49:24.254 --> 00:49:26.376]  I love free will, and I believe we can keep it.
[00:49:27.162 --> 00:49:30.203]  But let me tell you, the stuff that's going on, you should be acting like I'm acting.
[00:49:30.223 --> 00:49:31.084]  You should be upset.
[00:49:31.604 --> 00:49:42.348]  See, they take your tribal energy for football and sports, you go yell and scream for three hours, you feel really great because you're meant to yell and scream getting fired up in life with your children, your wife, your husband.
[00:49:43.669 --> 00:49:52.032]  With the art you're doing, with the culture you're producing, not just sitting there and letting the globalists through television and through Hollywood program everybody.
[00:49:54.505 --> 00:49:57.549]  And so I'm here to tell you, you don't have to believe a word I'm saying.
[00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:58.690]  I know I'm telling you the truth.
[00:49:59.111 --> 00:50:00.132]  And truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:50:00.473 --> 00:50:07.361]  I'm here to get you to wake up and get fired up about freedom, and I want you to consciously know what's happening to humanity, so you can make a decision.
[00:50:07.582 --> 00:50:12.107]  Do you want to be part of retaining humanity, or do you want to just say, I don't care about life?
[00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:13.428]  I'm just comfortable.
[00:50:13.468 --> 00:50:15.289]  Let them put stuff in our water and food.
[00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.969]  Let them take over.
[00:50:16.209 --> 00:50:17.029]  Let them program us.
[00:50:17.269 --> 00:50:18.930]  Let them put chips in the troops' brains.
[00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:25.612]  Let them put, you know, ten years ago, tracker chips in most of the special forces, and the last five years, brain chips in troops that are hurt.
[00:50:26.012 --> 00:50:28.253]  Because I'm all for it if somebody's blind or whatever needs it.
[00:50:28.473 --> 00:50:30.373]  The problem is the Trojan horses.
[00:50:30.893 --> 00:50:31.874]  Who's behind it?
[00:50:32.014 --> 00:50:32.914]  What are they doing?
[00:50:34.249 --> 00:50:38.452]  And man, I tried to read the government documents that were public back in 96, 97, 98, 99, 2000.
[00:50:40.294 --> 00:50:42.596]  People said, who is this nutball?
[00:50:44.417 --> 00:50:45.919]  Plus, he's got a Texas accent.
[00:50:46.719 --> 00:50:48.260]  Everybody's dumb in Texas.
[00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:52.044]  That's why corporations all over the world try to hire executives from Texas.
[00:50:52.584 --> 00:50:58.129]  I saw a number of years ago, I think it was in Money Magazine, there were more executives from Texas, more newscasters from Texas.
[00:50:58.925 --> 00:51:00.147]  More artists from Texas.
[00:51:00.187 --> 00:51:02.030]  I'm not going into a Texas worship fest here.
[00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:06.777]  I just, you know, a bunch of Hollywood people saying Texas are a bunch of idiots.
[00:51:07.017 --> 00:51:08.279]  You're a bunch of morons.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.002]  Audie Murphy's from Texas, punks.
[00:51:10.936 --> 00:51:13.878]  The whistleblower we got coming on to blow Benghazi wide open.
[00:51:14.158 --> 00:51:15.458]  Tosh Plumlee's from Texas.
[00:51:15.819 --> 00:51:18.780]  I'm proud to be from the Lone Star State.
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.281]  And I'm proud to be a Texan.
[00:51:20.681 --> 00:51:21.321]  And I'm awake.
[00:51:21.682 --> 00:51:22.382]  And I'm smart.
[00:51:22.582 --> 00:51:25.163]  But more importantly, I'm aggressive and don't like being a slave.
[00:51:25.383 --> 00:51:26.324]  And I'm willing to fight.
[00:51:26.524 --> 00:51:29.886]  And I don't care how much programming you dump on me, I just get stronger.
[00:51:30.626 --> 00:51:33.748]  Because I'm not tying into some DARPA anti-human programming.
[00:51:34.008 --> 00:51:36.350]  I'm tying into my ancestors and the good Lord above.
[00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:39.332]  And God's got a lot of tricks up his sleeves against evil.
[00:51:39.552 --> 00:51:43.255]  As long as good men stand up and do the right thing, God will carry us the rest of the way.
[00:51:46.217 --> 00:51:48.499]  So that's what this comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:48.879 --> 00:51:55.444]  I told you over and over again, and it's been public, that they're going to put brain chips in people.
[00:51:55.864 --> 00:51:59.867]  And we're going to get so sick from all the vaccines, the GMOs, the garbage, the fluoride,
[00:52:00.848 --> 00:52:03.872]  That everybody's gonna have to have chips and implants just to live.
[00:52:03.932 --> 00:52:07.297]  That's how they plan for the technocracy to control you.
[00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:11.323]  And then the globalists get the life extension technologies.
[00:52:11.383 --> 00:52:13.025]  They test all this garbage on us.
[00:52:13.245 --> 00:52:14.387]  This is what's going on.
[00:52:14.427 --> 00:52:17.752]  We're a giant vat of guinea pigs being tested on.
[00:52:18.988 --> 00:52:31.316]  And they also admit with all the toxins and poisons they're giving us, they expect with all the 41 years they've been taking blood worldwide from all newborn babies and putting it in the UN database that I exposed in 96, declassified 2005 nationwide, worldwide.
[00:52:31.957 --> 00:52:32.677]  Oh yes, we broke that.
[00:52:33.298 --> 00:52:36.400]  That they're looking and patenting your own DNA in your blood.
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.521]  And then tracking you through life.
[00:52:38.561 --> 00:52:42.043]  The hospitals don't even know when the government gets the blood test back.
[00:52:42.343 --> 00:52:45.786]  They just get a directive that, you know, the health department or the CDC wants your blood.
[00:52:46.106 --> 00:52:49.108]  They take some blood, send it off like obedient Obamacare servants.
[00:52:49.608 --> 00:52:56.112]  That gets sent off, and then they track why you were resistant to what they put in you, so that can be passed on to the elite.
[00:52:57.233 --> 00:53:02.036]  See, now you're starting to understand how this ball game works.
[00:53:02.737 --> 00:53:04.398]  Now, let's go on to this article.
[00:53:05.216 --> 00:53:06.556]  This is French News Agency.
[00:53:06.576 --> 00:53:10.297]  It's also in RT, AP, uh, everywhere.
[00:53:10.357 --> 00:53:13.258]  DARPA working on brain implants to help store memory.
[00:53:13.278 --> 00:53:14.319]  That's what the Russians say.
[00:53:14.639 --> 00:53:15.319]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:17.159]  Here's the AFP French News one.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.941]  Some of those researchers say those who benefit include the five million Americans with Alzheimer's.
[00:53:23.261 --> 00:53:26.702]  Yeah, don't ask why Alzheimer's is exploding or, you know, just, you know, take a brain chip.
[00:53:27.932 --> 00:53:29.553]  And the nearly 300,000 U.S.
[00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:33.615]  military men and women who sustained traumatic brain injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:53:34.435 --> 00:53:41.119]  If you have been injured in the line of duty and you can't remember your family, we want to be able to restore those kinds of functions.
[00:53:41.799 --> 00:53:47.182]  DARPA program manager Justin Sanchez said this week at a conference in the U.S.
[00:53:47.202 --> 00:53:51.965]  Capitol converted by the Center for Brain Health, University of Texas.
[00:53:54.065 --> 00:53:55.105]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:53:55.585 --> 00:53:57.666]  And what did I tell you probably 50 times on air?
[00:53:57.746 --> 00:54:02.407]  I was let in by a high-level individual at the University of Texas 12 years ago, repeatedly.
[00:54:02.427 --> 00:54:09.248]  I mean, shoot, there's even video of me doing video shoots in there for one of Kevin Booth's films.
[00:54:09.749 --> 00:54:12.649]  And I was allowed to see some of the DARPA areas, accidentally.
[00:54:12.969 --> 00:54:14.870]  And the monkeys with the wires hooked up to their brain.
[00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:20.391]  And at the entrance to every one of the restricted labs, it would say DARPA and the name of the program on the door.
[00:54:21.852 --> 00:54:23.513]  And they would punch stuff out.
[00:54:23.613 --> 00:54:31.620]  I see the monkeys out at the lab, out in the Bastrop, all being hit with different flicker rates on how to control the public through television.
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.942]  They, you know, great apes, rhesus monkeys, whole deal.
[00:54:36.063 --> 00:54:36.803]  No big deal, though.
[00:54:36.823 --> 00:54:38.124]  It's all for your own good.
[00:54:39.245 --> 00:54:41.788]  And they would have subliminal audio testing.
[00:54:42.629 --> 00:54:49.835]  They had a whole lab funded by DARPA on how to have a flicker rate to make women become sexually aroused, but not know why they were becoming aroused.
[00:54:50.316 --> 00:54:58.784]  I mean, when you're sitting there watching television, DARPA is hitting you with carrier signals put over the broadcast that most people that are executives don't even know about.
[00:54:58.804 --> 00:55:04.049]  I mean, you're being hit by 60 years of positronic warfare research.
[00:55:06.542 --> 00:55:09.124]  Because the government loves you.
[00:55:09.144 --> 00:55:18.269]  He goes on and says if you've been injured in the line of duty and can't remember your family, we want to be able to restore those kind of functions.
[00:55:18.289 --> 00:55:24.913]  So DARPA's public rollout of brain chips is for the troops, for the old people, for the children.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:30.823]  And again, when I start going blah when I'm old, I want electronic eyes.
[00:55:30.903 --> 00:55:31.843]  I want digital eyes.
[00:55:32.564 --> 00:55:35.866]  When our heart goes out, I want a buy on a cart, or one grown.
[00:55:36.486 --> 00:55:39.988]  The problem is these globalists are devils, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:40.268 --> 00:55:41.990]  They're poisoning us on purpose.
[00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:44.311]  We can't trust anything they give us.
[00:55:44.651 --> 00:55:51.475]  If Sauron, in Lord of the Rings as an analogy, gives you the ring, when the Hobbit offers Gandalf the ring, why does he refuse it?
[00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:53.697]  Because it's evil.
[00:55:54.257 --> 00:55:55.758]  Because someone wicked made it.
[00:55:57.313 --> 00:56:02.215]  All the will, all the hate, all the evil, it's all backdoored.
[00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:10.379]  It's all set up by psychopath anti-humans that think it's all a joke and are only giving us technology to control us and dominate us while they get all the goodies.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.062]  And undoubtedly a lot of this stuff will end up going to the public and being good.
[00:56:16.142 --> 00:56:24.626]  It's just you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen, they want brain chips for social control and to make humans biological androids because they're better than robots.
[00:56:24.966 --> 00:56:25.867]  That's the bottom line.
[00:56:26.863 --> 00:56:29.447]  And I'll probably have the New York Times go, Alex Jones is crazy.
[00:56:29.747 --> 00:56:32.591]  He claims they have brain chips for trips when it's already admitted.
[00:56:33.312 --> 00:56:34.293]  Alex Jones is crazy.
[00:56:34.313 --> 00:56:35.235]  He claims there's drones.
[00:56:36.436 --> 00:56:37.298]  Alex Jones is crazy.
[00:56:37.518 --> 00:56:38.720]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.724]  He says the memo says Benghazi even though it does.
[00:56:41.784 --> 00:56:42.305]  Jay Carney.
[00:56:43.715 --> 00:56:46.156]  I mean, that's how stupid they think you are.
[00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:47.117]  Are you really that dumb?
[00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:49.157]  I mean, people say, hey, let's go to the UT game.
[00:56:49.618 --> 00:56:53.739]  I mean, down the street, they've got a mind control base hooked into monkeys being tortured.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.821]  It's like, I can't go have fun knowing that's going on.
[00:56:58.402 --> 00:57:02.263]  And they're killing the monkeys, torturing them to learn how to control us.
[00:57:03.264 --> 00:57:05.064]  And of course, the professors and people, they don't care.
[00:57:05.104 --> 00:57:05.945]  They're just getting funding.
[00:57:07.432 --> 00:57:11.415]  I was brought in there by people that wanted to show me what was going on.
[00:57:11.435 --> 00:57:14.457]  Because nobody was talking about this 12, 13 years ago.
[00:57:16.078 --> 00:57:16.878]  I said 12 years ago.
[00:57:16.898 --> 00:57:17.279]  Time flies.
[00:57:17.319 --> 00:57:19.100]  That was like 14 years ago.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.441]  And I had no idea.
[00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:25.984]  I mean, I knew about DARPA and stuff, but I'm not going to get into how I was in, how I saw it all.
[00:57:26.545 --> 00:57:29.226]  But they know it's all over there at that department over there.
[00:57:29.547 --> 00:57:31.908]  That thing is hooked into stuff all over the country.
[00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:34.350]  And I wasn't shown the classified stuff.
[00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:35.911]  I was shown the restricted stuff.
[00:57:37.185 --> 00:57:46.172]  And let me tell you, they see you as lower than those monkeys, ladies and gentlemen, and they're in there testing how to ruin your life, how to take your family over right now.
[00:57:47.352 --> 00:57:50.214]  Well, that's oppositional disorder towards authority.
[00:57:50.555 --> 00:57:51.635]  See, I'm mentally ill.
[00:57:51.656 --> 00:57:53.997]  I don't like all the things that are happening.
[00:57:54.518 --> 00:57:56.139]  I don't like Adolf Hitler.
[00:57:56.419 --> 00:57:58.881]  Next hour, coming up with the big whistleblower and gun news.
[00:58:00.242 --> 00:58:04.225]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:58:04.285 --> 00:58:08.388]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:58:08.648 --> 00:58:12.071]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:58:12.311 --> 00:58:15.193]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:58:15.353 --> 00:58:22.718]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:58:22.918 --> 00:58:26.561]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:58:26.821 --> 00:58:31.085]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:58:31.245 --> 00:58:37.170]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:40.973]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:58:41.153 --> 00:58:43.695]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:58:43.895 --> 00:58:45.236]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:58:45.396 --> 00:58:46.637]  It's time to take action.
[00:58:46.758 --> 00:58:48.479]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:59:00.247 --> 00:59:07.391]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:09.652]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:59:09.873 --> 00:59:15.075]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:15.215 --> 00:59:20.338]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:20.458 --> 00:59:23.560]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:27.763]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:27.963 --> 00:59:32.286]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:32.366 --> 00:59:42.513]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:42.733 --> 00:59:47.076]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:59:47.196 --> 00:59:53.660]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:59:53.780 --> 01:00:01.847]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-31... Coast to Coast.
[01:00:02.227 --> 01:00:03.548]  Direct from Austin.
[01:00:04.269 --> 01:00:08.373]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:12.516 --> 01:00:20.263]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.246 --> 01:00:29.026]  Hit me again!
[01:00:29.647 --> 01:00:34.589]  Put me live, second hour, on this fourth day of May 2014.
[01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:44.674]  Coming up, the Tosh Flumley interview, integrated from the two interviews earlier in the week that are so bombshell with the latest info that's coming out.
[01:00:44.954 --> 01:00:48.476]  We're going to air some excerpts of that and get into other news as well.
[01:00:49.596 --> 01:00:49.997]  Wow!
[01:00:50.617 --> 01:00:51.577]  Where to begin?
[01:00:51.617 --> 01:00:53.018]  I haven't got into this news yet.
[01:00:53.418 --> 01:00:55.539]  The new issue of the magazine is out, 1776 Part 2.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.522]  Buy them in bulk at costinfo or store.com.
[01:01:00.822 --> 01:01:05.545]  And in it we get into the latest on the Bundy Ranch, but the BLM's activities in Texas and other areas.
[01:01:05.585 --> 01:01:07.406]  But here's a new article from AP.
[01:01:07.906 --> 01:01:11.008]  Feds consider taking Alaskan tribal land into trust.
[01:01:12.264 --> 01:01:12.504]  The U.S.
[01:01:12.524 --> 01:01:16.427]  Department of Interior announced this week that it will consider taking Alaskan tribal land into trust.
[01:01:16.788 --> 01:01:25.895]  The move could lead to pockets of Indian country where tribal courts and governments would have authority to create their own laws and justice systems, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
[01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:31.179]  So now they're announcing the feds are taking it over so the Indians can have their own laws.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.460]  That's selling a lie.
[01:01:32.761 --> 01:01:33.822]  They've done this in other states.
[01:01:33.862 --> 01:01:35.343]  They end up taking the tribal authority away.
[01:01:36.857 --> 01:01:43.060]  Currently, the only Indian County community with a reservation in the state is in Southeast Alaska.
[01:01:43.341 --> 01:01:44.581]  The state opposes the move.
[01:01:44.981 --> 01:01:48.123]  Well, who even needs a stinking state, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:01:48.183 --> 01:01:50.985]  So, get the current issue of InfoWars Magazine.
[01:01:51.565 --> 01:01:52.766]  Get it out to everyone you know.
[01:01:54.211 --> 01:02:02.458]  I meant to talk about this earlier, I'll try to get into it later after the Plumlee interview, but Grandfather launches smart gun push after Sandy Hook's shooting.
[01:02:03.459 --> 01:02:05.821]  Oh, and of course, guaranteed he's tied to Bloomberg.
[01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:10.024]  But the whole thing is, come on, let me have a biometric gun, don't say no.
[01:02:10.805 --> 01:02:12.046]  You know, after Sandy Hook.
[01:02:12.787 --> 01:02:14.228]  Why doesn't the NRA want this?
[01:02:14.308 --> 01:02:15.950]  No, make your stupid biometric guns.
[01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:17.912]  The point is, they'll end up not working.
[01:02:17.932 --> 01:02:19.053]  The government can scramble them.
[01:02:19.393 --> 01:02:20.754]  The government can make them obsolete.
[01:02:20.814 --> 01:02:22.676]  They can electromagnetic pulse take them out.
[01:02:23.217 --> 01:02:29.142]  And a lot of the big systems coming out, the government's gonna have the codes to, just like with iPhones and stuff, to not let you videotape in public.
[01:02:29.423 --> 01:02:30.584]  How about not let you shoot?
[01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:36.334]  So smart meters, smart houses, smart cars, smart this, smart that.
[01:02:36.654 --> 01:02:38.895]  It's all about the back doors built into everything.
[01:02:39.496 --> 01:02:49.600]  And the GOP has come out and said, as Holder said a month ago, or almost a month ago, they want to make all the other guns be banned and make you go to these biometric smart bracelet garbage deals.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.721]  So that's the new big anti-gun push.
[01:02:51.861 --> 01:02:54.803]  GOP fears executive order on biometric guns.
[01:02:55.743 --> 01:03:06.808]  Senator Cornyn is warning the Obama administration to not issue an executive order requiring that all new guns be made with biometric technology such as fingerprint recognition or bracelets.
[01:03:07.369 --> 01:03:13.371]  Cornyn raised the issue in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, who in testimony earlier this month highlighted biometric bracelets.
[01:03:13.631 --> 01:03:20.655]  Well, I heard on local 590 radio earlier this week, they were covering it on the news and I pulled it up.
[01:03:21.701 --> 01:03:25.823]  You know, the grandfather that runs this, I mean, come on, you're not against brain chips, it's for the troops!
[01:03:26.463 --> 01:03:29.104]  Well, come on, you're not against biometric guns, it's for a grandpa!
[01:03:29.124 --> 01:03:31.105]  I mean, it's for the kids of Sandy Hook!
[01:03:31.125 --> 01:03:38.888]  Well, I heard he supposedly claims he's been threatened and he's not going to release the gun now, as if there aren't all these other companies that already have it for decades.
[01:03:39.488 --> 01:03:45.951]  You know, because of the evil anti-gunners, while they were mean to a grandpa, stunt, stunt, that's what I call, that's my opinion.
[01:03:47.054 --> 01:03:58.324]  So, that's where all of this is going, and they just always package it in this sicky-sweet stuff, and to target people that aren't conscious, that aren't aware of what's going, that aren't aware of what's happening.
[01:03:59.025 --> 01:04:03.508]  The truth is, 167 people died in 2013 in what's called mass shootings.
[01:04:04.489 --> 01:04:08.673]  And more than half of them were gangbangers shooting each other.
[01:04:09.233 --> 01:04:10.615]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing.
[01:04:11.698 --> 01:04:12.758]  People say, what is that, okay?
[01:04:12.838 --> 01:04:13.038]  No.
[01:04:13.399 --> 01:04:19.881]  But it's, in most so-called mass shootings, you know, and all the rest of it, is people killing each other in criminal-related stuff.
[01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:26.723]  It was 60-something, I forget the exact number, like 65, 66, that actually died in school shootings that wasn't gang-related.
[01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:28.444]  And that's a tragedy, and it's terrible.
[01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:30.284]  One man dies, it's a tragedy.
[01:04:30.304 --> 01:04:32.685]  10,000 die, it's a statistic, as Stalin said.
[01:04:33.586 --> 01:04:34.526]  And the system knows that.
[01:04:34.966 --> 01:04:37.187]  But deer kill hundreds, honeybees kill hundreds.
[01:04:37.547 --> 01:04:38.587]  I know I harp on this.
[01:04:38.987 --> 01:04:40.548]  This is what we've got to get out to people.
[01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:46.744]  Literal, literal peanut allergies kill more people than terrorists and mass shootings.
[01:04:46.784 --> 01:04:52.148]  So it is a red herring meant to frame all of us that are pro-gun through guilt as the murderers.
[01:04:53.409 --> 01:04:57.051]  We're going to break on this Sunday edition, this fourth day of May 2014.
[01:04:57.211 --> 01:05:03.155]  We're going to come back on the other side and we're going to get into the Tosh Plumlee interview.
[01:05:03.235 --> 01:05:04.996]  Tell your friends and family, tune in.
[01:05:05.396 --> 01:05:06.117]  This is important.
[01:05:09.744 --> 01:05:13.087]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:05:13.187 --> 01:05:15.408]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:05:15.609 --> 01:05:23.915]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:05:24.195 --> 01:05:39.527]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[01:05:39.687 --> 01:05:40.207]  We're good to go.
[01:06:16.275 --> 01:06:27.003]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commonwealth.
[01:06:27.143 --> 01:06:32.507]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:06:33.048 --> 01:06:38.272]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[01:06:39.112 --> 01:06:40.573]  It is a big idea.
[01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:42.635]  A new world order.
[01:06:46.315 --> 01:06:49.117]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:06:49.317 --> 01:06:50.858]  It just pancaked.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:57.063]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[01:07:10.503 --> 01:07:15.407]  I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:07:15.427 --> 01:07:20.610]  Guns will be taken.
[01:07:20.691 --> 01:07:22.052]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:23.973]  We're going to take all guns.
[01:07:24.033 --> 01:07:28.817]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:07:28.877 --> 01:07:30.338]  Global governance at last.
[01:07:30.418 --> 01:07:31.378]  Is it one world?
[01:07:31.419 --> 01:07:32.840]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:36.702]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:37.283]  And for me!
[01:07:49.041 --> 01:07:51.103]  Thank you for spending part of your Sunday with us.
[01:07:51.163 --> 01:08:00.168]  I hope you've had your friends and family tune in because over much of this hour you're about to hear excerpts of an interview I did last Thursday on the weekday show.
[01:08:00.188 --> 01:08:05.712]  I don't usually re-air stuff on the Sunday show unless it's Ron Paul or somebody really big like Rand Paul.
[01:08:06.909 --> 01:08:10.230]  Or back when we got a Ted Cruz interview, but this is really big.
[01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.230]  Or a Viggo Mortensen interview, stuff like that.
[01:08:13.991 --> 01:08:15.131]  This is really important.
[01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.952]  This guy was a major CIA contractor going back to the 50s.
[01:08:18.992 --> 01:08:19.692]  He still is.
[01:08:20.152 --> 01:08:23.273]  He's been vetted in Congress, been given gag orders before.
[01:08:23.293 --> 01:08:27.534]  He just exposed what really happened at Benghazi.
[01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:34.175]  And what really went on there, that it was a hit of the ambassador so they could cover up what was happening.
[01:08:34.555 --> 01:08:35.697]  Government narcotics running.
[01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:38.159]  He personally flew 40 tons of cocaine into the country.
[01:08:38.459 --> 01:08:39.420]  That's been declassified.
[01:08:40.281 --> 01:08:47.109]  This is Tosh Plumlee and excerpts of my lengthy hour-long interview that I did with him last Thursday.
[01:08:48.078 --> 01:08:50.420]  So, here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.862]  You want to know what happened in Benghazi?
[01:08:52.222 --> 01:08:53.383]  This guy's risking his life.
[01:08:53.803 --> 01:09:00.429]  He's been told the Justice Department's about to subpoena him, good old Eric Holder, to gag him, to shut him up.
[01:09:01.951 --> 01:09:04.954]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not theory, this is fact.
[01:09:05.014 --> 01:09:06.775]  Here is Robert Tosh Plumlee.
[01:09:13.151 --> 01:09:16.433]  Now, going to Robert Tosh Plumlee, goes by Tosh.
[01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.354]  Most of you already know who he is.
[01:09:18.494 --> 01:09:22.696]  It's just that he's one of the biggest public whistleblowers out there.
[01:09:23.256 --> 01:09:28.199]  And he says if they gag him, as they've said the subpoena's coming, this time he will not shut up.
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.341]  And Tosh, A, why aren't you going to shut up?
[01:09:32.081 --> 01:09:35.963]  And then B, where do you see all this going?
[01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:40.826]  And then C, any other points you didn't make yesterday before we got questions?
[01:09:42.301 --> 01:09:46.364]  Well, I don't feel I should be stressed.
[01:09:46.564 --> 01:09:51.728]  I mean, if they had sort of left me alone, perhaps I wouldn't even have went into this.
[01:09:52.469 --> 01:10:06.820]  The Benghazi questions originated from information that came from a NATO source over in Afghanistan who was working that project after he'd been transferred from working the Mexico Task Force project.
[01:10:08.968 --> 01:10:10.809]  In that, they found out about weapons.
[01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:18.992]  He contacted me, and then that started the questions, the questions about the 11 Benghazi questions I had after.
[01:10:20.512 --> 01:10:23.053]  That evidently created problems in D.C.
[01:10:23.854 --> 01:10:27.915]  and started them wanting to know where my contacts were.
[01:10:28.955 --> 01:10:34.177]  I told the information that I was a journalist, but I would not disclose those contacts.
[01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:38.379]  They went undercover, went down for a few months,
[01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:42.642]  And then came back up again threatening me.
[01:10:43.122 --> 01:11:06.046]  This came out after I saw after your program and two sources, one military and one civilian source, contacted me a few days ago and told me that I better watch what I was doing because the DOJ was in process of issuing, going to issue a subpoena on me.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:15.568]  The reason that I decided to make contact was I know what happens when you're subpoenaed to go back and testify to a committee.
[01:11:16.308 --> 01:11:30.861]  The nature of what I'm dealing with and what I've dealt with in the past would be immediately classified top secret committee sensitive and that is where the gag comes in because at that point, if I continue to relay those questions and ask for answers,
[01:11:31.368 --> 01:11:38.532]  Then I would be in violation of the National Security Statute and subject to five, I think it was 20 years, they told me, in a federal prison.
[01:11:39.112 --> 01:11:52.899]  I went and talked to an attorney about this and then he told me to be extremely careful and then I decided, well, the only thing that I can do is, again, try to go out through the Sunshine Law and put this all out before the fact.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:59.883]  And so that's the reason for me, in the last few days, going on all these programs and talking about this.
[01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:01.931]  What do I expect to happen?
[01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:16.616]  I expect that the political powers that be will try to turn this political and try to say that I am trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton's re-election campaign, or election campaign, which is not the truth.
[01:12:17.296 --> 01:12:27.719]  So, and I've already been told that that's what that particular group, if I've called it that way, are saying, is that Swami has been paid
[01:12:36.544 --> 01:12:40.547]  It shows they're totally disconnected from reality and their staffers didn't even show it to them.
[01:12:40.968 --> 01:12:42.569]  A very serious whistleblower letter.
[01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:44.991]  Let's expand on this now, then.
[01:12:45.232 --> 01:12:51.697]  Clearly, they don't want your questions to be looked at, so they want to question you, send you the subpoena that's basically a gag order.
[01:12:52.598 --> 01:12:54.299]  Well, I was just taken out of politics.
[01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:29.545]  There's good people in the NSA, but there's also gatekeepers, political gatekeepers that get put into all these organizations, mainstream media and every place else.
[01:13:30.146 --> 01:13:35.888]  So the good people that are actually working in our government and working for the people can't do their jobs.
[01:13:35.908 --> 01:13:38.589]  In other words, this has been a slow process of eroding.
[01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:40.269]  I call it the American Slow Coup.
[01:13:40.289 --> 01:13:47.112]  In other words, by infiltrating political cronies into strategic positions,
[01:13:47.978 --> 01:13:57.342]  To be gatekeepers and suck up any derogatory information like gun running, international gun running, and other matters, and keep that from hitting on the mainstream media.
[01:13:58.283 --> 01:14:11.349]  Mainstream media is infiltrated with all kinds of government gatekeepers to stop information from getting to the American people so that they can make wise decisions.
[01:14:12.129 --> 01:14:17.312]  So, I thought, with my background and my experience, I can see it happening.
[01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:19.222]  We're losing our freedom.
[01:14:19.482 --> 01:14:20.522]  Us balls agree.
[01:14:20.882 --> 01:14:22.643]  Gradually, gradually, gradually.
[01:14:22.703 --> 01:14:26.065]  And by the way, Mr. Plumlee, they are hiding the evil in plain view.
[01:14:26.105 --> 01:14:34.189]  They announced last year the quote legalization of CIA and others inside media putting out psyops and disinformation.
[01:14:34.609 --> 01:14:36.150]  Now that's always been going on.
[01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:37.310]  There's the headline, U.S.
[01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:38.551]  Repeals Propaganda Ban.
[01:14:38.931 --> 01:14:41.092]  Spreads government-made news to Americans.
[01:14:41.132 --> 01:14:42.953]  But it's not even government propaganda.
[01:14:43.726 --> 01:14:49.971]  It's criminal networks that have shut off the eyes and ears of even the government so they can get away with anything.
[01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:53.414]  My God, this is the biggest national security threat ever.
[01:14:53.954 --> 01:15:05.744]  The government has had a corporate fraudulent coup d'etat within it and these people are so greedy that John Corzine's making 40 to 1 bets with other people's money at MF Global and not getting in trouble.
[01:15:05.984 --> 01:15:08.326]  That's an example of how ruthless they are.
[01:15:08.787 --> 01:15:12.470]  Only Bernie Madoff got in trouble because he stole money from other globalists.
[01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:25.356]  The globalists have gotten to the point that they are literally above the law and are so dumb, they thought they could arm Al Qaeda publicly to blow up Christian churches and shoot down aircraft with missiles we gave them.
[01:15:25.696 --> 01:15:27.476]  They are not going to get away with this, Tosh.
[01:15:27.637 --> 01:15:37.741]  Well, the reason that they do that is that they have gone on a program through many different presidents, by the way, to sympathize the people so that we don't react.
[01:15:39.241 --> 01:15:50.410]  Alright folks, thanks for joining us on this Sunday edition.
[01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:57.156]  We'll be right back with more of this bombshell interview with the CIA whistleblower, Tosh Plumley.
[01:15:57.276 --> 01:15:58.077]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:58.417 --> 01:15:59.979]  InfoWars.com is the website.
[01:16:00.239 --> 01:16:02.681]  Follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[01:16:09.884 --> 01:16:15.989]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:16:16.009 --> 01:16:19.332]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:16:19.352 --> 01:16:21.034]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:16:21.074 --> 01:16:27.379]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:16:27.479 --> 01:16:33.344]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:16:33.504 --> 01:16:37.286]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:40.368]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:16:40.549 --> 01:16:48.554]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:16:48.814 --> 01:16:50.875]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:16:50.915 --> 01:16:51.956]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:16:52.316 --> 01:17:01.068]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:17:09.611 --> 01:17:11.912]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement.
[01:17:11.932 --> 01:17:13.972]  A lot of you asked me to come speak in your town or city.
[01:17:14.192 --> 01:17:19.854]  I would love to, but I'm so busy here in the trenches at the Infowars Demand Center, I'm just unable to travel.
[01:17:20.034 --> 01:17:29.216]  When my friends at Stansbury Research, one of the top analyst firms in the world, invited me to be part of a special one-day event in Dallas, Texas, I could not say no.
[01:17:29.416 --> 01:17:37.078]  You will hear from true experts like Porter Stansbury, T. Boone Pickens, Cactus Schroeder, Bill Murphy, Van Simmons, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:17:37.478 --> 01:17:40.139]  I will be speaking on the fact that history is happening now.
[01:17:40.159 --> 01:17:44.140]  We are now at a critical juncture where more happens in a month than happened in the previous 10 years.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.682]  I will also be breaking down the fact that a moral society is the only truly prosperous and safe society.
[01:17:49.902 --> 01:17:50.662]  May 31st.
[01:17:50.822 --> 01:17:51.622]  It's one day.
[01:17:51.642 --> 01:17:53.503]  The tickets will sell out.
[01:17:53.803 --> 01:17:58.364]  Simply visit AlexJonesDallas.com or follow the banners at InfoWars.com.
[01:17:58.644 --> 01:18:03.269]  I have secured a discount for my listeners when you visit AlexJonesDallas.com.
[01:18:03.389 --> 01:18:08.775]  Again, that's AlexJonesDallas.com to secure your tickets for this one-time event, and I'll see you in Dallas.
[01:18:09.454 --> 01:18:13.497]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:18:13.537 --> 01:18:17.640]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:21.303]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:18:21.543 --> 01:18:24.445]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:18:24.585 --> 01:18:31.891]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:18:32.171 --> 01:18:35.832]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:18:36.072 --> 01:18:40.333]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:18:40.493 --> 01:18:46.414]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:18:46.454 --> 01:18:50.235]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:18:50.395 --> 01:18:52.935]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:18:53.135 --> 01:18:54.475]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:18:54.635 --> 01:18:55.856]  It's time to take action.
[01:18:55.996 --> 01:18:57.656]  It's time to filter our water.
[01:18:57.836 --> 01:19:04.980]  Visit Infowarsstore.com and use promo code WATER to get 10% off their entire family of incredible products.
[01:19:05.221 --> 01:19:08.242]  Our call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:19:08.383 --> 01:19:18.549]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:26.714]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:19:27.014 --> 01:19:31.696]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:19:31.877 --> 01:19:38.620]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:45.763]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:19:45.844 --> 01:19:52.707]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:19:52.867 --> 01:19:57.230]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:00.633]  Available in original, or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:20:00.753 --> 01:20:06.897]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:20:07.057 --> 01:20:09.299]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.781]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.522]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:14.203 --> 01:20:17.405]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.361]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:20:23.841 --> 01:20:24.321]  A lie!
[01:20:24.742 --> 01:20:26.482]  No man is obsolete!
[01:20:26.763 --> 01:20:28.623]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:20:28.663 --> 01:20:31.565]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:20:31.925 --> 01:20:37.047]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:20:37.428 --> 01:20:39.128]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:20:39.148 --> 01:20:40.209]  A crawling insect!
[01:20:40.849 --> 01:20:44.713]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:20:45.313 --> 01:20:46.434]  I am a human being!
[01:20:46.835 --> 01:20:54.142]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[01:20:54.662 --> 01:20:55.383]  I don't care!
[01:20:55.823 --> 01:20:56.844]  I tell you, I don't care!
[01:20:56.864 --> 01:20:59.006]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[01:20:59.046 --> 01:21:03.230]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives!
[01:21:03.974 --> 01:21:05.755]  Even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.956]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:21:09.376 --> 01:21:16.879]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:19.721]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream!
[01:21:20.121 --> 01:21:22.582]  And the state has no use for your kind!
[01:21:24.262 --> 01:21:27.784]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:21:28.364 --> 01:21:30.125]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:21:43.095 --> 01:21:44.295]  All right, I'm not going to waste time.
[01:21:44.355 --> 01:21:45.556]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:21:45.616 --> 01:21:50.257]  Here's more of Tosh Plumlee, the CIA whistleblower and the Benghazi bombshell.
[01:21:55.238 --> 01:21:57.179]  We take a risk having people on the air like this.
[01:21:57.219 --> 01:22:11.083]  I'm not trying to toot our horn or anything, but if I told you all the stories and stuff I've seen, heard, the threats, the attacks, both physical and economic, there's a bunch of them going on right now that we've uncovered.
[01:22:12.952 --> 01:22:15.494]  It's just you just learn to deal with it and turn it over to God.
[01:22:15.915 --> 01:22:16.675]  Because here's the deal.
[01:22:17.176 --> 01:22:23.901]  We're going to have Tosh back on very soon to do a whole hour with us, not on this subject, but on all the things he saw on Iran-Contra and so much more.
[01:22:23.961 --> 01:22:27.244]  I know a lot of that's been gagged and sealed, but he is one of the main witnesses.
[01:22:29.326 --> 01:22:33.930]  All I know is they recruited heavily out of Texas, different government agencies, mainly out of the Army.
[01:22:34.531 --> 01:22:40.556]  So I've had quite a few family that did different stuff, some of it pretty senior and on the muscle end of things.
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.963]  And they all just said the government's totally evil and does horrible things.
[01:22:45.444 --> 01:22:48.327]  There's, on the top, there's a light side and there's a dark side.
[01:22:49.108 --> 01:22:52.512]  And there's good people in government that are trying to do good, but they're less and less.
[01:22:53.893 --> 01:22:58.579]  And, Tosh, I want to go to phone calls, but would you agree, though, that it's getting worse
[01:23:00.123 --> 01:23:02.824]  And that the light side in government is getting smaller?
[01:23:03.304 --> 01:23:09.087]  Or is it that the good guys just aren't able to get around the NSA now, and the courts are so corrupt?
[01:23:09.147 --> 01:23:12.348]  I mean, or have things always been like this?
[01:23:13.828 --> 01:23:15.789]  No, no, in my opinion it's getting worse.
[01:23:15.829 --> 01:23:25.153]  That's one reason I re-engaged myself and got active in this, if you want to call me a whistleblower or whatever, because as over the years, as I've called this
[01:23:26.098 --> 01:23:43.489]  Heading in that direction, eroding the Constitution, losing our friends, watching the appointment of the Supreme Court, looking at the agenda, the secret agenda that these administrations have, watching the hundreds and hundreds of lobbyists have access to the White House.
[01:23:44.069 --> 01:23:50.513]  I can't even talk to my elected representatives because they won't talk to me unless I give them a whole bunch of wad of money.
[01:23:51.394 --> 01:23:53.155]  When I started seeing all this content,
[01:23:54.614 --> 01:23:56.555]  America is going down the chute, man.
[01:23:56.575 --> 01:23:57.695]  We're losing our freedom.
[01:23:57.715 --> 01:23:59.195]  By the way, I've talked to you off the air.
[01:23:59.255 --> 01:24:02.156]  Your phone's clear, and you were clear during the break, and now you're distorted.
[01:24:02.436 --> 01:24:04.677]  They're definitely messing with your phone on purpose right now.
[01:24:05.057 --> 01:24:06.437]  Usually I say it's... I know.
[01:24:06.477 --> 01:24:08.638]  This happened yesterday on Hagman and Hagman 2.
[01:24:09.058 --> 01:24:09.638]  Same thing.
[01:24:11.159 --> 01:24:12.339]  Rodney in North Carolina.
[01:24:12.359 --> 01:24:12.819]  You're on the air.
[01:24:12.859 --> 01:24:13.239]  Go ahead.
[01:24:14.599 --> 01:24:14.980]  Yeah.
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.060]  How you doing, Alec?
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:16.640]  I'm alright.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:16.900]  Go ahead.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:17.420]  You got a question?
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:18.421]  Yeah.
[01:24:18.441 --> 01:24:18.901]  Alright.
[01:24:19.261 --> 01:24:20.941]  We know this government's treasonous.
[01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:23.662]  They're doing everything they can to go against
[01:24:27.315 --> 01:24:34.897]  The Benghazi thing alone, I've seen the video as the attack was going on live on Al Jazeera TV over there.
[01:24:35.317 --> 01:24:40.519]  I posted the video on Facebook and it got removed and I was told I was in violation of content.
[01:24:41.899 --> 01:24:46.241]  Now, how do we remove this government and put in a whole new government?
[01:24:47.901 --> 01:24:50.162]  Okay, if that's your question, I have a simple answer for you.
[01:24:51.368 --> 01:24:56.914]  I wish us old farts would really screw things up instead of the political ramifications that are going on in this country.
[01:24:57.414 --> 01:25:00.417]  We need the young generation to get out here and get active.
[01:25:01.238 --> 01:25:01.598]  Study.
[01:25:02.559 --> 01:25:03.220]  Go out here.
[01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:05.823]  Find the answers for yourself.
[01:25:07.079 --> 01:25:09.481]  Do your own research and come to your own conclusion.
[01:25:09.501 --> 01:25:14.345]  We could also have JAG military courts start to investigate the criminality, but they'd be arrested immediately.
[01:25:14.845 --> 01:25:18.388]  Computain, if I'm pronouncing it right, we're going to you in Arizona.
[01:25:18.408 --> 01:25:19.389]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:25:19.689 --> 01:25:20.390]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:21.070]  Hey brother.
[01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:27.615]  Hey, I want to focus on methods and tactics that Tosh is experiencing.
[01:25:27.655 --> 01:25:33.040]  Based on his experience and observations on previous incidents,
[01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:41.618]  Is there anything unusual with the methods and tactics that this racketeering government is using against them?
[01:25:42.078 --> 01:25:53.021]  And if he were in full control of the faculties and prepared to respond to an attack, are there major flaws in the tactics that are being used against them?
[01:25:55.402 --> 01:25:56.723]  Well, that's a mouthful.
[01:25:56.763 --> 01:25:59.043]  I'm not sure how to answer the question.
[01:26:02.106 --> 01:26:03.287]  Alright, here's the thing.
[01:26:03.307 --> 01:26:05.109]  The way I see it, okay, it's escalated.
[01:26:20.755 --> 01:26:23.057]  Okay, I'm just going to go back to Iran-Contra.
[01:26:23.137 --> 01:26:24.599]  I testified with Kerry.
[01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:25.800]  I got gagged on that.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.462]  I testified in the committee since it's top secret.
[01:26:28.842 --> 01:26:32.866]  Then when I continued out and I wrote an article, well, I didn't write it, but a friend of mine wrote it.
[01:26:32.946 --> 01:26:33.967]  I'm a legal reader.
[01:26:34.007 --> 01:26:35.328]  I run drug trucks with BAM.
[01:26:35.808 --> 01:26:42.815]  Named all the staging points, the SFID, the people involved, and everything else for the sole purpose of to protect myself.
[01:26:43.235 --> 01:26:44.676]  I was called in front of the committee.
[01:26:44.736 --> 01:26:47.619]  I raised my right hand, and then they sealed
[01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:49.886]  Uh, committee sensitive.
[01:26:50.307 --> 01:26:59.113]  And then, when I asked for a transcript, they told me, well, you don't have a classification or a security clearance, so therefore you can't see your own testimony.
[01:26:59.654 --> 01:27:06.619]  And then, if I went out and talked about it, I could possibly be in violation of a national security statute.
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:10.162]  And I could receive up to five to ten years in federal sentence entry.
[01:27:10.928 --> 01:27:16.772]  Alright, the fact that I admitted that I was a cocaine smuggler into this country and taking U.S.
[01:27:16.832 --> 01:27:23.716]  weapons out of this country to a secret base in Santa Arlena was pretty heavy information at that particular time.
[01:27:24.437 --> 01:27:28.900]  I was warned at that stop, I better not do this, I better not let this go on.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.302]  Anyway, there's a whole story behind all that.
[01:27:33.523 --> 01:27:36.985]  Okay, Senator Hart wrote a letter to both committees.
[01:27:37.614 --> 01:27:41.377]  And it's been posted on my Facebook page and it's been posted on the internet.
[01:27:42.098 --> 01:27:45.140]  Bill Holden was Senator Gary Hart's security advisor.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:28:01.052]  I contacted him and put all the maps and everything out for the sole purpose to protect me from going to a federal prison because I admitted that I'd flown cocaine, as much as 40 tons of cocaine, into this country on C-130.
[01:28:02.489 --> 01:28:06.751]  I admitted that, but it was a sanctioned operation that was supposed to be interdiction.
[01:28:07.231 --> 01:28:16.276]  The interdiction went to, uh, Del Toro Marine Naval Air Station, and the evidence then was filtrated, and the drugs got out on the street.
[01:28:16.896 --> 01:28:26.241]  Also, at the same time, when we come back on those C-130s, we're flying weapons from the 82nd Airborne that went on maneuvers down at Hunters.
[01:28:26.821 --> 01:28:29.923]  Those weapons were taken off the GAO books,
[01:28:31.155 --> 01:28:31.515]  I'm good.
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:29:06.458]  And then transferred by truck to China Lake to be retrofitted, and then sent back to a drug runner's base known as Carl Quintero at Vera Cruz, where he was receiving $10,000 a month of CIA money to use his branch in Aerospace as a refueling stop for the formation of the Southern Front.
[01:29:06.498 --> 01:29:07.659]  Stay there, it's incredible.
[01:29:07.679 --> 01:29:08.560]  We'll do one more segment.
[01:29:09.867 --> 01:29:17.729]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:29:17.969 --> 01:29:20.050]  All the major networks are state-run.
[01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:22.831]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:29:22.911 --> 01:29:27.012]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[01:29:27.252 --> 01:29:30.473]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:29:30.493 --> 01:29:37.775]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:29:37.955 --> 01:29:42.077]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:29:42.257 --> 01:29:43.958]  We are the true media.
[01:29:44.079 --> 01:29:46.660]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:50.402]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[01:30:09.613 --> 01:30:16.198]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
[01:30:16.498 --> 01:30:20.000]  A practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.161]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:30:22.361 --> 01:30:23.042]  Fluoride!
[01:30:23.262 --> 01:30:25.523]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:30:25.663 --> 01:30:31.487]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:30:31.727 --> 01:30:36.508]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:30:36.648 --> 01:30:42.730]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:45.130]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:48.031]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:30:48.311 --> 01:30:51.692]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:30:51.812 --> 01:30:57.039]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:57.259 --> 01:31:02.065]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:31:09.534 --> 01:31:11.855]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement.
[01:31:11.875 --> 01:31:13.916]  A lot of you asked me to come speak in your town or city.
[01:31:14.116 --> 01:31:19.799]  I would love to, but I'm so busy here in the trenches at the Infowars Demand Center, I'm just unable to travel.
[01:31:19.959 --> 01:31:29.164]  When my friends at Stansbury Research, one of the top analyst firms in the world, invited me to be part of a special one-day event in Dallas, Texas, I could not say no.
[01:31:29.344 --> 01:31:36.988]  You will hear from true experts like Porter Stansbury, T. Boone Pickens, Cactus Schroeder, Bill Murphy, Van Simmons, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:31:37.408 --> 01:31:40.070]  I will be speaking on the fact that history is happening now.
[01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:44.033]  We are now at a critical juncture where more happens in a month than happened in the previous 10 years.
[01:31:44.053 --> 01:31:49.636]  I will also be breaking down the fact that a moral society is the only truly prosperous and safe society.
[01:31:49.836 --> 01:31:50.597]  May 31st.
[01:31:50.757 --> 01:31:51.557]  It's one day.
[01:31:51.578 --> 01:31:53.439]  The tickets will sell out.

[01:32:09.405 --> 01:32:16.527]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:32:16.667 --> 01:32:18.848]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:32:19.029 --> 01:32:24.212]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:29.496]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:32:29.636 --> 01:32:32.718]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:32:32.998 --> 01:32:36.921]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:32:37.141 --> 01:32:41.464]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:32:41.544 --> 01:32:51.691]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:32:51.891 --> 01:33:02.818]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:33:02.958 --> 01:33:09.223]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:11.745]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:12.125 --> 01:33:13.447]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:14.167 --> 01:33:18.270]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:25.957 --> 01:33:27.918]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:28.298 --> 01:33:30.080]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.162]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.832 --> 01:33:43.640]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen, more of this taped interview with CIA insider whistleblower Robert Tosh Plumling.
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:54.111]  If you just joined us in the last segment, he put all his cards on the table and just started talking about, I personally in flights flew 40 tons of cocaine into the United States.
[01:33:54.171 --> 01:33:56.053]  I ran contra sanctioned by the White House.
[01:33:56.634 --> 01:33:57.054]  I flew
[01:33:58.035 --> 01:33:59.855]  I'm really getting in their face.
[01:33:59.875 --> 01:34:01.836]  In other words, I've been told it hasn't elapsed.
[01:34:01.856 --> 01:34:03.336]  That's what my attorney told me.
[01:34:03.356 --> 01:34:07.897]  I better not go on air and keep talking about this because I'm going to get myself in a lot of trouble.
[01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:23.992]  My feeling is this, I want it out there before the fact.
[01:34:24.432 --> 01:34:27.454]  I want it documented and vetted by many different sources.
[01:34:27.935 --> 01:34:34.220]  Which I have done, and that's the reason I opened up my Facebook page and started compiling all this stuff together to protect me.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:46.569]  Because I knew if I continued to talk mainly about Iran-Contra and the weapons shipments and violations of the Golden Commitment, the setting up of the Southern Front and Point West with the secret airbase in Santa Elena,
[01:34:47.170 --> 01:34:47.751]  We're good to go.
[01:35:00.296 --> 01:35:03.100]  In answer to the other gentleman's question, how did it escalate?
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.942]  It started escalating at that point.
[01:35:04.982 --> 01:35:06.905]  That's the reason I brought up Iran-Contra.
[01:35:07.365 --> 01:35:08.947]  It started escalating at that point.
[01:35:08.987 --> 01:35:10.569]  I began to realize, hey, wait a minute.
[01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:12.452]  We have another enemy out here.
[01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:17.158]  The average 8 to 5 American cannot comprehend that other world that lives out there.
[01:35:17.816 --> 01:35:39.032]  The world of pilots, the loaders, the refuelers, the secret airbases, the Hustle Solo in Central America, John Hull's ranch, who receives $10,000 a month in CIA money, Point West, Oliver North, 16 felonies, suddenly paroled and becomes an American hero, and then passes judgment on a pilot like me.
[01:35:39.052 --> 01:35:41.033]  In other words, these kind of things upset me.
[01:35:41.774 --> 01:35:45.076]  But so, then you're sitting here and you're saying, well, what do I do about it?
[01:35:45.532 --> 01:35:47.054]  Do I do like everybody else?
[01:35:47.094 --> 01:35:48.596]  Do I sit and piss and moan about it?
[01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:50.458]  Or am I going to do something about it?
[01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:54.162]  I'm a C-130 pilot now, and I've been contacted by the CIA.
[01:35:54.662 --> 01:35:54.963]  Okay.
[01:35:55.383 --> 01:35:58.206]  If I piss the CIA off, I don't really care.
[01:35:58.226 --> 01:35:59.468]  They pissed me off.
[01:35:59.948 --> 01:36:01.810]  Otherwise, I'm talking way out of school.
[01:36:02.191 --> 01:36:03.052]  Way out of school.
[01:36:03.152 --> 01:36:03.953]  And I know that.
[01:36:04.636 --> 01:36:12.402]  But somebody's got to get out here and rattle the American people and get them off the couch and get them engaged.
[01:36:12.743 --> 01:36:25.633]  And the way to do it is get them engaged and start studying and reading what the hell is really going on in this country, and then get out and use their God-given rights and their talents and let's put a stop to it.
[01:36:26.214 --> 01:36:27.715]  That's all I can say about that.
[01:36:27.735 --> 01:36:28.836]  Sure, I want to go back to calls.
[01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:29.396]  Powerful.
[01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:32.179]  I want to go back to calls, sir, but specifically
[01:36:33.476 --> 01:36:42.258]  When you look at all of this, the public has been in denial, or they feel powerless, and the big issue is, this is getting worse and worse.
[01:36:42.318 --> 01:36:55.801]  The tyranny is expanding, and to show how they gave you a thin cover, they told you it was interdiction, that you were getting the cocaine and flying it back here, because I remember reading the Iran-Contra files that were public, to destroy the cocaine.
[01:36:56.421 --> 01:36:58.642]  You then learned that that really wasn't going on.
[01:37:00.026 --> 01:37:02.327]  Well, some of it was, and some of it wasn't.
[01:37:02.487 --> 01:37:07.130]  The special ops that were filtering into the bin raised up the money to get guns for the contract.
[01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:12.112]  That doesn't mean that that was a complete government sanctioned operation, but it won't run out of the White House.
[01:37:12.713 --> 01:37:12.893]  Period.
[01:37:12.973 --> 01:37:15.294]  In other words, through cutouts and so on like that.
[01:37:15.374 --> 01:37:25.019]  I was on, uh, CBS about our, uh, Forest Service aircraft, uh, being used as cutouts to private companies in order to carry the drugs down there.
[01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:28.481]  I mean, there is another world out there that the 8 to 5
[01:37:29.696 --> 01:37:31.796]  Do not understand that even exists.
[01:37:31.876 --> 01:37:34.457]  And all I've been trying to do is say, wait a minute.
[01:37:35.117 --> 01:37:36.937]  This matter is escalating.
[01:37:36.957 --> 01:37:40.938]  In other words, to answer your question, I hope I got it right.
[01:37:41.338 --> 01:37:43.119]  So I start seeing this happen.
[01:37:43.559 --> 01:37:45.519]  Then I start seeing my buddies going to jail.
[01:37:45.539 --> 01:37:47.760]  Then I start seeing some of them committing suicide.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:49.640]  Then I start seeing characters of fascination.
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:53.281]  And then I have the characters of fascination applied upon me.
[01:37:53.301 --> 01:37:58.082]  In other words, the best way to stop an operation is control the communication.
[01:37:58.582 --> 01:37:59.342]  I started watching.
[01:37:59.983 --> 01:38:10.912]  Gatekeepers being infiltrated in the mainstream media to suck up any information that may be derogatory to our ongoing... Now I understand, and they killed... What do you know about Mary Seale and others being killed?
[01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:15.556]  Mary Seale was killed by Colombians that were tipped off by our own government.
[01:38:16.176 --> 01:38:24.043]  So basically, I say, during the Reagan administration, that information was leaked out to the very people, which it could possibly happen to me,
[01:38:24.804 --> 01:38:26.846]  In a way that brought them in.
[01:38:26.886 --> 01:38:33.872]  How the hell did they get into this country as illegal to come out here and gun him down sitting in his Cadillac when the judge put him in a safe house?
[01:38:34.433 --> 01:38:35.814]  Yes, Barry Seal was my friend.
[01:38:35.894 --> 01:38:36.955]  I flew the fat lady.
[01:38:37.015 --> 01:38:38.016]  I flew it out of MENA.
[01:38:38.396 --> 01:38:40.298]  I flew the fat lady in to get it sealed.
[01:38:40.738 --> 01:38:44.202]  I helped set up the camera to photograph Vaughn and them in Central America.
[01:38:44.762 --> 01:38:51.328]  I'm the shadow warrior that someone has referred to when my dossier was classified top secret.
[01:38:51.983 --> 01:38:53.464]  I'm a CIA operative.
[01:38:53.864 --> 01:38:54.564]  Field operative.
[01:38:54.604 --> 01:38:56.105]  But I'm one step beyond that.
[01:38:56.625 --> 01:39:00.547]  I'm also in the Pentagon with a crew known as Procuring Guard.
[01:39:01.027 --> 01:39:02.127]  Now, I've said it.
[01:39:02.507 --> 01:39:04.488]  I've told me, you can't say that.
[01:39:04.528 --> 01:39:06.129]  You're going to go to jail for saying that.
[01:39:06.169 --> 01:39:07.629]  Okay, I'm saying it to you, Alex.
[01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:09.230]  I'm saying it right on your program.
[01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:12.031]  And just as solid as I can.
[01:39:12.732 --> 01:39:14.132]  I don't know how else to say it.
[01:39:15.173 --> 01:39:18.274]  We are involved in an international gunrunning operation.
[01:39:19.094 --> 01:39:20.935]  Benghazi came up.
[01:39:21.539 --> 01:39:38.374]  And I'm not going to have our political people turn this into a political thing by saying that I am coming out here to raise the Ben Dawson question so that Hillary, so that I destroy the possibility of Hillary Clinton running for the office of the presidency.
[01:39:38.895 --> 01:39:39.896]  That is bullsh**.
[01:39:39.916 --> 01:39:41.137]  That is not my motive.
[01:39:41.497 --> 01:39:45.721]  My motive is to get to the American people that you're being stolen from.
[01:39:45.801 --> 01:39:47.923]  Our tax dollars are going down the drain.
[01:39:48.809 --> 01:39:49.910]  I'm not taking an issue.
[01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:50.891]  I'm not a radical.
[01:39:51.251 --> 01:39:52.812]  But, you know, call me what you want.
[01:39:53.573 --> 01:39:58.496]  But the point is, the reality of it is that this has been a slow coup.
[01:39:58.577 --> 01:40:04.521]  The reality is openly giving Al-Qaeda heat-seeking missiles is too much for you, and you're not going to be part of it.
[01:40:05.722 --> 01:40:07.143]  No, I'm not going to be part of it.
[01:40:07.463 --> 01:40:12.487]  A couple of C-130 pilots that are pissed off, they're still military.
[01:40:12.527 --> 01:40:13.908]  They can't talk like they're doing.
[01:40:13.928 --> 01:40:16.350]  They say, my God, you won't believe, I just got refueled.
[01:40:17.471 --> 01:40:18.632]  Air-to-air refueling.
[01:40:19.258 --> 01:40:22.599]  In order to get weapons from the Direct Commercial Sales Program to the Middle East.
[01:40:23.339 --> 01:40:25.140]  And stored them at a safe house in Jordan.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.461]  A CIA safe house in Jordan, Pakistan.
[01:40:29.641 --> 01:40:32.342]  That broke out a little bit a few months ago.
[01:40:32.842 --> 01:40:34.983]  And the gatekeepers immediately squashed it.
[01:40:36.043 --> 01:40:37.404]  Also, back to Gary Hart.
[01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:41.405]  Gary Hart wrote a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:40:43.026 --> 01:40:44.126]  He released all the maps.
[01:40:44.986 --> 01:40:47.007]  He released all the flight plans.
[01:40:47.478 --> 01:40:48.179]  We're good to go.
[01:41:09.853 --> 01:41:14.917]  Our Senate and our Congress already knew about it, but they didn't tell the American people about it.
[01:41:15.377 --> 01:41:28.966]  And when Gary Hart wrote the letter asking for an investigation, because that was the only reason I went to the man and said, hey, I want to get a congressional investigation into this because I'm running guns illegally to a Southern front in violation of the Boland Amendment.
[01:41:29.427 --> 01:41:30.948]  What do I do, Mr. Senator?
[01:41:31.548 --> 01:41:34.931]  I've done exactly what me as an American citizen was supposed to do.
[01:41:35.351 --> 01:41:40.055]  I was supposed to contact my senator and sit down and expose any illegal operations.
[01:41:40.696 --> 01:41:43.078]  At that point in time, I was a government employee.
[01:41:43.699 --> 01:41:51.025]  According to federal law, it is my responsibility to become aware of any illegal operations that involve taxpayer money.
[01:41:51.085 --> 01:41:53.487]  It is my obligation to protect my people's privacy.
[01:41:54.977 --> 01:41:56.218]  That's right, your phone's breaking up.
[01:41:56.759 --> 01:42:05.887]  But it is the law, you're supposed to report illegal stuff, but then they'll try to use some national security issue on you and now throw you in jail for 20 years, not five.
[01:42:06.348 --> 01:42:09.671]  And Obama has prosecuted more people with that than any other president before him.
[01:42:10.231 --> 01:42:13.913]  I want to go to some phone calls and skip this network break because this is so historical.
[01:42:13.933 --> 01:42:20.055]  You're hearing a major CIA contractor, one of the most famous ones ever, also with a deep cover Pentagon.
[01:42:20.595 --> 01:42:22.136]  He just gave the code name for that.
[01:42:22.716 --> 01:42:24.697]  And Tosh Plumlee, Robert Tosh Plumlee.
[01:42:25.057 --> 01:42:26.858]  Robert Tosh Plumlee is his Facebook.
[01:42:27.218 --> 01:42:29.999]  We have the information mirrored at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:30.399 --> 01:42:31.640]  This is InfoWars.
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:33.541]  And we saw the military
[01:42:34.401 --> 01:42:42.785]  By the thousands, including officers, holding up over their face in uniform last year, signs saying, I will not attack Syria for Al Qaeda.
[01:42:43.325 --> 01:42:47.347]  And so I think they went too far trying to openly arm Al Qaeda.
[01:42:48.207 --> 01:42:49.588]  And that's what Benghazi was all about.
[01:42:49.608 --> 01:42:54.270]  And so Tosh Plumlee is blowing it all wide open and explaining what it's really all about.
[01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:56.770]  Don't touch that dial.
[01:42:57.051 --> 01:42:58.873]  This couldn't be more important information.
[01:42:58.933 --> 01:43:02.037]  Later we'll archive the audio of this up on InfoWars.com.
[01:43:02.297 --> 01:43:05.421]  The conclusion of the CIA Insider Whistleblower.
[01:43:05.741 --> 01:43:07.664]  Robert Tosh Plumlee on the other side.
[01:43:09.622 --> 01:43:12.964]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:43:13.065 --> 01:43:15.286]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:43:15.486 --> 01:43:23.752]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:36.942]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula, sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:43:37.142 --> 01:43:48.029]  And then concentrated for maximum potency, Supramel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:43:48.429 --> 01:43:54.533]  Supramel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:43:54.753 --> 01:44:03.379]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Supramel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[01:44:09.666 --> 01:44:19.857]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:44:20.037 --> 01:44:26.982]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:44:27.142 --> 01:44:31.846]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:44:32.026 --> 01:44:38.711]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:44:38.811 --> 01:44:45.896]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:44:45.956 --> 01:44:52.861]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:44:53.001 --> 01:44:57.364]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:44:57.484 --> 01:45:07.011]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[01:45:09.793 --> 01:45:17.656]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:45:17.896 --> 01:45:19.977]  All the major networks are state-run.
[01:45:20.137 --> 01:45:22.758]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:45:22.818 --> 01:45:26.940]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:30.421]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:37.704]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:41.986]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:45:42.186 --> 01:45:43.887]  We are the true media.
[01:45:43.967 --> 01:45:46.589]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:45:46.689 --> 01:45:50.331]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[01:46:09.608 --> 01:46:13.611]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:46:13.651 --> 01:46:17.794]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:46:18.034 --> 01:46:21.417]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:46:21.677 --> 01:46:24.559]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:46:24.719 --> 01:46:32.045]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:35.946]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:46:36.206 --> 01:46:40.427]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:46:40.607 --> 01:46:46.549]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:46:46.589 --> 01:46:50.370]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:53.071]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:46:53.271 --> 01:46:54.611]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:46:54.771 --> 01:46:55.991]  It's time to take action.
[01:46:56.132 --> 01:46:57.792]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:47:14.162 --> 01:47:17.384]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:23.936 --> 01:47:29.538]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.038 --> 01:47:30.518]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:31.358 --> 01:47:34.999]  Infowars.com, yeah.
[01:47:35.039 --> 01:47:44.822]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:46.642 --> 01:47:52.004]  Well, Tosh Plumlee, one of the most famous Iran-Contra, you name it, whistleblowers ever,
[01:47:53.263 --> 01:48:03.855]  Still flies contracts for the CIA because he's been a congressional testimony that was authorized so they can't stop him from still having his job.
[01:48:05.176 --> 01:48:08.801]  He has broken huge Benghazi information last year.
[01:48:10.213 --> 01:48:13.535]  That's now been vetted and confirmed by a lot of the information that's been coming out.
[01:48:13.976 --> 01:48:16.558]  So he's gotten in contact, the Justice Department subpoena is coming.
[01:48:17.138 --> 01:48:18.819]  That will basically gag him.
[01:48:18.859 --> 01:48:20.140]  It'll say that he's not allowed to talk about it.
[01:48:20.701 --> 01:48:25.144]  Once he testifies, they'll then say all of that is secret and he can never talk about it again.
[01:48:25.164 --> 01:48:35.712]  Okay, what started all this was a source of mine, a friend of mine, uh, was transferred from the task force, uh, operating in Mexico after Afghanistan, and then it was attached to a NATO field command.
[01:48:36.332 --> 01:48:46.796]  In that process of NATO field command, it turned out about finding weapons, US weapons, being stashed at annexed buildings and also in safe houses in Jordan and Pakistan.
[01:48:47.197 --> 01:48:49.778]  It was trying to leak out.
[01:48:50.358 --> 01:49:01.843]  Then, when the weapons were stolen or pilferated, then they started showing up, and not during rebels, but in various different groups.
[01:49:01.903 --> 01:49:02.903]  These weapons started
[01:49:03.642 --> 01:49:10.827]  Uh, grenades, RPGs, uh, uh, launchers, grenade launchers, all this stuff started showing up in other hands.
[01:49:10.987 --> 01:49:15.830]  This was before, sort of before the rebels, you know, the, whatever you call the rebels, the Syrian rebels.
[01:49:16.451 --> 01:49:20.053]  But, before we were even trying to arm them.
[01:49:20.073 --> 01:49:21.674]  So, and then, here's the, here's the thing.
[01:49:21.694 --> 01:49:24.896]  This is what my source told me, and this is what motivated me.
[01:49:25.637 --> 01:49:27.638]  Ambassador Stevens found out about this.
[01:49:28.438 --> 01:49:32.301]  He made a complaint, in writing, back to the State Department.
[01:49:32.802 --> 01:49:39.285]  Complaining about the proof of the weapons and how and why was these weapons getting into these people's hands.
[01:49:40.605 --> 01:49:42.206]  There's dispatches for that.
[01:49:42.646 --> 01:49:44.127]  There's more than one memo.
[01:49:44.867 --> 01:49:47.248]  State Department is putting on those memos.
[01:49:47.888 --> 01:49:53.791]  Now just recently, first State Department says, oh no, he's full of crap, we don't have nothing like that.
[01:49:54.525 --> 01:49:54.925]  Thank you.
[01:50:13.688 --> 01:50:16.011]  I brought that up to Colonel Schaefer weeks after it happened.
[01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:17.012]  He said, that's the word.
[01:50:17.412 --> 01:50:18.813]  It was a hit to take out Stevens.
[01:50:19.154 --> 01:50:22.557]  He got in a bunch of trouble, so he said, I'm just saying, somebody, it was a planned hit.
[01:50:22.977 --> 01:50:24.839]  The point is, that's the best intel.
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:27.041]  We know the weapons were for Al Qaeda.
[01:50:27.081 --> 01:50:27.442]  We know the...
[01:50:29.178 --> 01:50:33.421]  The ambassador from Turkey was there.
[01:50:33.782 --> 01:50:35.023]  They were supposed to ship him up there.
[01:50:35.043 --> 01:50:38.365]  We know Turkey's been the main conduit, along with Saudi Arabia.
[01:50:38.666 --> 01:50:39.506]  It's all confirmed.
[01:50:39.746 --> 01:50:44.230]  So they wanted to take Stevens out because he was going to end up testifying to Congress.
[01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:52.777]  And then when the Navy SEALs didn't stand down, the sheep-dipped CIA, former Navy SEALs, came and two of them held down the Al-Qaeda force.
[01:50:53.337 --> 01:50:54.398]  Well, that's about the size of it.
[01:51:19.168 --> 01:51:22.671]  Uh, my information came, coincides with that information.
[01:51:23.111 --> 01:51:25.893]  In other words, this has been vetted from many, many different sources.
[01:51:26.473 --> 01:51:30.977]  But at the time, when the Benghazi questions were arraigned, they said they were all crazy.
[01:51:30.997 --> 01:51:34.599]  There was nothing to these questions, but yet they refused to answer them.
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:38.963]  I would just like to take one of those questions and ask direct POTUS.
[01:51:39.463 --> 01:51:44.287]  Ask someone that has access to POTUS, ask him just one of these questions.
[01:51:45.207 --> 01:51:46.188]  Get it on the record.
[01:51:46.795 --> 01:51:49.537]  What does he have to say about that question?
[01:51:50.077 --> 01:51:51.118]  Yes or no.
[01:51:51.338 --> 01:51:52.779]  Very simple answer.
[01:51:53.179 --> 01:51:53.900]  Yes or no.
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:56.361]  There's 11 questions posted up there.
[01:51:56.761 --> 01:51:59.203]  It's been all over the internet since September.
[01:51:59.743 --> 01:52:04.687]  Why are these people refuse to answer those questions?
[01:52:05.427 --> 01:52:07.668]  Those questions are not that complicated.
[01:52:08.089 --> 01:52:09.109]  They're very simple.
[01:52:09.970 --> 01:52:16.194]  Now, Benghazi, we lost four good people because of our intelligence failure.
[01:52:17.034 --> 01:52:20.276]  That doesn't mean that we have a bad intelligence network.
[01:52:20.796 --> 01:52:29.100]  It means that we have gatekeepers that have infiltrated those networks instigated by our own political structure.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:37.604]  And that basically makes the country blind in the end, having all these triple agents of corporate interest inside government.
[01:52:37.924 --> 01:52:39.185]  These people are the biggest threat.
[01:52:40.643 --> 01:52:41.104]  That's it.
[01:52:41.224 --> 01:52:43.489]  In other words, this has been a slow coup.
[01:52:43.529 --> 01:52:45.453]  Like I say, it's been ongoing for years.
[01:52:45.513 --> 01:52:46.795]  This didn't happen overnight.
[01:52:46.815 --> 01:52:49.380]  In other words, we have been infiltrating people.
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:51.740]  Call them CIA, call them whatever.
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.881]  I say they're one group beyond the CIA.
[01:52:53.941 --> 01:52:56.281]  I don't blame the CIA for all this.
[01:52:56.501 --> 01:53:00.462]  There's damn good people in the CIA, but they can't get past those gatekeepers.
[01:53:00.802 --> 01:53:09.204]  They can't get past those non-qualified gatekeepers that are put in those positions by the politics of the time.
[01:53:09.644 --> 01:53:13.925]  Whether it be Bush era, Clinton era, or Obama era.
[01:53:14.545 --> 01:53:16.345]  Who is the man behind the curtain?
[01:53:20.219 --> 01:53:21.420]  Who's pulling the string?
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:25.081]  Who is in charge of this international gunrunning operation?
[01:53:25.722 --> 01:53:29.384]  Is there an international gunrunning operation ongoing today?
[01:53:29.944 --> 01:53:34.066]  All I'm asking is for the American people to get off their couch, go out, check out.
[01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:37.972]  Research, investigate, and come to your own conclusion.
[01:53:53.154 --> 01:53:54.134]  Hi Alex, Tosh.
[01:53:55.114 --> 01:53:59.695]  Okay Alex, to me it looks like exactly what you were talking about yesterday with the gaslighting.
[01:53:59.835 --> 01:54:10.058]  This administration is so good at gaslighting all these scandals and let's face it, they've had their own share of scandals and gaslighting is something they've gotten really good at.
[01:54:10.818 --> 01:54:16.179]  Tosh, you've been around for, I think you were born in 1937, so you've been around through a few administrations.
[01:54:16.659 --> 01:54:19.500]  Seems like the people at the top, they never really changed.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:20.580]  Motives don't change.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:33.684]  It seems like the American public now, I wouldn't know because I'm 28 years old, but it seems like generations, they have changed drastically while the people at the top haven't changed.
[01:54:33.804 --> 01:54:35.585]  What makes it in this generation?
[01:54:36.065 --> 01:54:43.947]  Do you think this generation with all these scandals and the fact that we've really done nothing about them or don't seem too interested in it,
[01:54:44.392 --> 01:54:49.915]  Do you think we have the capability of peacefully assembling and doing something about it?
[01:54:50.055 --> 01:54:50.996]  Absolutely, Tosh.
[01:54:51.756 --> 01:54:52.596]  The same question.
[01:54:52.816 --> 01:54:53.557]  What do we do about it?
[01:54:54.531 --> 01:54:56.972]  Alright, yeah, okay, yes we do have the ability.
[01:54:57.032 --> 01:54:57.653]  That's the reason.
[01:54:57.693 --> 01:55:02.575]  In other words, it's time for, if you want to call it rebel rousing or what the heck ever you call it.
[01:55:03.056 --> 01:55:11.480]  We've got to do something to motivate this younger generation, because the older generation has already contaminated this so bad, that they themselves cannot untangle it.
[01:55:11.901 --> 01:55:17.003]  In other words, we are so indebted to some of these politicians that we have put in there.
[01:55:17.504 --> 01:55:19.144]  And they're lobbyists and they're cronies.
[01:55:19.645 --> 01:55:21.726]  And they're the ones that we've got to get rid of.
[01:55:22.267 --> 01:55:23.008]  Here's the problem.
[01:55:23.348 --> 01:55:33.756]  We've got a Congress and we've got a Senate that is totally contaminated with gatekeepers that we have put in position ourselves during these elections.
[01:55:34.076 --> 01:55:36.618]  I don't know if these elections are real or not.
[01:55:36.678 --> 01:55:38.119]  I'm not going to get off on theory.
[01:55:38.479 --> 01:55:39.460]  The point is this.
[01:55:40.421 --> 01:55:46.385]  Infiltration has started over the years and it's migrated to where it is today.
[01:55:46.405 --> 01:55:48.327]  So people that are really
[01:55:48.905 --> 01:55:49.285]  That's right.
[01:55:49.325 --> 01:55:55.130]  So we need more people in the system and outside the system to speak out and have a moral revival.
[01:55:55.150 --> 01:55:55.611]  That's the answer.
[01:55:55.811 --> 01:55:57.552]  And Tosh Plumlee is leading it with his courage.
[01:56:11.644 --> 01:56:13.664]  Hey, get a march on D.C.
[01:56:13.744 --> 01:56:14.565]  like we did in the 60s.
[01:56:14.705 --> 01:56:18.545]  In other words, get everybody together that wants to save this Constitution.
[01:56:18.966 --> 01:56:27.487]  And I don't mean be radical, and I don't mean be a non-peaceful, and I don't mean going threatening, and I don't mean get a bunch of armed militia showing up pointing guns at everybody.
[01:56:27.527 --> 01:56:28.688]  That's not the way to do it.
[01:56:28.988 --> 01:56:32.608]  The way to do it is get a combined effort to make a march on Washington, D.C.
[01:56:32.648 --> 01:56:33.168]  Sure, sure.
[01:56:33.288 --> 01:56:35.789]  And support broadcasts that tell the truth and whistleblowers.
[01:56:36.209 --> 01:56:36.629]  Go ahead.
[01:56:36.669 --> 01:56:38.009]  Ramon in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:56:38.029 --> 01:56:38.409]  Go ahead.
[01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:39.210]  All right.
[01:56:39.250 --> 01:56:40.130]  First things first.
[01:56:41.283 --> 01:56:50.265]  You were involved in the Iran-Contra scandal, Mr. Plumlee, and obviously the black community was affected most by, you know, the crack epidemic and these situations.
[01:56:50.305 --> 01:56:58.607]  So I wanted to know your opinion on, how can I get my people more involved and more, get them to understand better that all these problems affect all of us.
[01:56:58.687 --> 01:57:00.588]  It's not just a white thing.
[01:57:00.648 --> 01:57:03.149]  It's not just a Clive and Bundy thing.
[01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:04.249]  It's an everyone thing.
[01:57:04.289 --> 01:57:08.330]  We should all rally around one another when we see these situations happening where
[01:57:08.792 --> 01:57:10.693]  You know, people are getting taken advantage of.
[01:57:10.773 --> 01:57:13.114]  And what's your opinion on how we can unite?
[01:57:13.334 --> 01:57:18.916]  Because the last caller touched on it, but my community is most affected by this because they don't have the knowledge.
[01:57:19.036 --> 01:57:22.417]  They haven't been taught all these situations like the Iran Contra.
[01:57:22.438 --> 01:57:24.078]  Now that's a great question, Tosh.
[01:57:24.098 --> 01:57:28.500]  Tosh, don't Americans have to come together regardless of race, religion, or creed for freedom?
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:30.581]  Yes, yes, definitely, definitely.
[01:57:30.882 --> 01:57:38.287]  First of all, look, that's one of the ways that they destroy the credibility of people that do the research and come forward.
[01:57:38.327 --> 01:57:41.689]  They're playing a race card against them.
[01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:43.050]  Well, folks, we've run out of time.
[01:57:43.090 --> 01:57:45.072]  I'm thinking about making this show three hours long.
[01:57:45.472 --> 01:57:48.994]  Speaking of three hours, I'll be back tomorrow live, Lord willing, so pray for us.
[01:57:49.014 --> 01:57:50.195]  This is dangerous stuff.
[01:57:50.736 --> 01:57:51.176]  11 a.m.
[01:57:51.616 --> 01:57:52.017]  to 2 p.m.
[01:57:52.037 --> 01:57:53.177]  on the weekday show.
[01:57:53.197 --> 01:57:56.540]  Stay tuned for more powerful information on this same station.
[01:57:59.534 --> 01:58:06.094]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
