[00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.513]  It's no secret that some of the entertainment industry are pushing a gun control agenda.
[00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:18.159]  Famously, we've seen celebrities, many who tout bodyguards and or live in gated communities, demand a plan.
[00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.100]  It's time for our leaders to act.
[00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:21.482]  Demand a plan.
[00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:22.963]  Right now.
[00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:24.064]  Right now.
[00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:24.942]  You!
[00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:25.984]  Demand it!
[00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:26.584]  Enough.
[00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:27.265]  Enough.
[00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:31.369]  Now, with much fanfare, comic book icon Archie will be murdered.
[00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:40.039]  But he won't be killed on a trip to Chicago, the city that has the strictest gun laws but still has a sizable amount of gun violence due to the failed war on drugs.
[00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:40.619]  No.
[00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.781]  Jughead's pal will be killed defending a senator who is a gay rights advocate running on a strong anti-gun platform.
[00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:53.763]  It's my understanding that the killer's actions are at least partially motivated by his views on gay marriage.
[00:00:54.283 --> 00:01:04.966]  As a side note, the feds who are sent to defend the senator carry revolvers, while the murderer himself carries a semi-automatic pistol, likely with what would be considered a high-capacity magazine.
[00:01:05.626 --> 00:01:22.882]  I'm a huge comic book fan, but the thing I've always noticed about these comic book cities is they oftentimes seem to have very strict gun control laws, because oftentimes the only people carrying a gun is either the police or a criminal, sometimes one and the same, but rarely do you see a law-abiding citizen defending themselves with a firearm.
[00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:34.796]  So whether it's paper and ink, or movie moguls like Harvey Weinstein saying that Second Amendment advocates were wished they were never born after seeing his anti-gun films, the right to bear arms is under attack from all angles.
