[00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:06.752]  Yeah.
[00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:15.474]  Syria's Deputy Prime Minister is saying what we've all known for years, that the U.S.
[00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:17.935]  needs to stop arming its own enemies.
[00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:23.077]  In front of the United Nations General Assembly, he said, What we see on the part of the U.S.
[00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:38.543]  administration is a double-standard policy and alliances to score certain political agendas through supporting with money, weapons and training the groups they call moderate, referring to the Obama administration providing means to al-Qaeda rebels who splintered into ISIS.
[00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:43.465]  But ISIS aren't the only ones using arms courtesy of our current administration.
[00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:48.027]  Guns were walked into Mexico via Operation Fast and Furious.
[00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:54.870]  CBS obtained documents that top brass in the Justice Department did this in hopes of demonizing the Second Amendment.
[00:00:55.251 --> 00:01:06.556]  Even after it was exposed that Attorney General Eric Holder knew about the operation, President Obama refused to let a good crisis go to waste and blamed the American gun rights for the violence in Mexico.
[00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:21.164]  The main point I made to the President is that we support Mexican government's focus on reducing violence, and we look forward to continuing our good cooperation in any way that the Mexican government deems appropriate.
[00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:36.707]  I also reaffirmed our determination in the United States to meet our responsibilities to reduce the demand for illegal drugs and to combat the southbound flow of illegal guns and cash that help to fuel violence.
[00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:43.464]  Whether it's across the border or across the world, don't let the fraud cross you without calling it out.

[00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:52.067]  That's what's happening, but they prey on people's ignorance.
[00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:58.130]  In fact, I knew it would happen, now I'm hearing that Assad, in the news, is protecting ISIS, which is Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.492]  Al-Qaeda in Syria, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, merged to form
[00:02:03.613 --> 00:02:04.975]  I don't think so.
[00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:28.093]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:38.244]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:42.327]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:47.552]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
