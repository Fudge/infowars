[00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:15.552]  In case you're wondering, the new title for Star Wars Episode VII was just released and it's going to be called The Force Awakens.
[00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:21.076]  Interesting title.
[00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:23.017]  We'll see if that still plays out.
[00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:25.958]  In the past there have been title changes at the last minute.
[00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:28.578]  Return of the Jedi was going to be called Revenge of the Jedi.
[00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.319]  And now we all hope that J.J.
[00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.920]  Abrams can succeed where the prequel failed.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.561]  And that's to create a movie with credible acting and not rely on cartoon characters to appeal to that elusive two to six year old demographic.
[00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:40.682]  What's this?
[00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:41.522]  A local.
[00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:48.124]  But where the prequel did go right is by illustrating the false flag operation and the Hegelian dialectic.
[00:00:48.743 --> 00:01:02.773]  In order to ensure the security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the First Galactic Empire!
[00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:08.778]  For a safe and secure society!
[00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:18.253]  Emperor Palpatine, or the Emperors he is referred to by the time he was thrown down a reactor shaft, started off as a mild-mannered senator from Naboo.
[00:01:18.773 --> 00:01:24.376]  He then hatched a multi-decade plan using many different alien races as his useful ID10Ts.
[00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:27.858]  That's idiots for all you out there who don't speak nerd.
[00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:30.299]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.420]  These aren't the droids we're looking for.
[00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:38.942]  He secretly initiates the creation of two armies, manages to get elected Chancellor under the guise of a humanitarian crisis.
[00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:49.913]  My first act with this new authority, I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.
[00:01:50.489 --> 00:02:04.280]  Then starts a war where both sides of the conflict have unlimited budgets to fight a war on hundreds of battlefronts, thereby draining the resources of all sides, and doing this under the nose of the Jedi, who just can't seem to realize that the guy walking and talking with them is a Sith Lord.
[00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.803]  The Dark Side clouds everything.
[00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:13.107]  The Emperor even manages to off all of his commanders.
[00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:18.167]  He will take care of you.
[00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:19.349]  Lord Sidious promised us peace.
[00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.029]  He only wanted...
[00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:38.337]  Look up the Knight of the Long Knives if you want a historical example for that one.
[00:02:38.977 --> 00:02:44.279]  Fast forward 18 years, the Supreme Chancellor disbands his dysfunctional government in favor of a dictatorship.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.601]  I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the Council permanently.
[00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:55.223]  Thus completing a galaxy-wide false flag which started off as a seemingly small planetary trade blockade on his home planet.
[00:02:56.504 --> 00:03:02.606]  So by playing off all sides against each other and creating a crisis, which is the Confederacy with a giant drone army,
[00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:09.052]  He is able to pull off the Hegelian dialectic by providing his own convenient clone army which he started creating years ago.
[00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:12.736]  Emperor Palpatine is the perfect technocrat dictator.
[00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:28.171]  So while it remains to be seen out there what will be seen in Episode 7, whether it's Chrome Stormtroopers, the Inquisitor, or Chewbacca with a bionic hand, it will be interesting to see if J.J.
[00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:32.773]  Abrams can harness the archetypes and historical references that George Lucas used all so well.
[00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:38.735]  The fact that he is now under the Disney umbrella probably means anything meaningful won't be seen in this film.
[00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:41.416]  There'll be a lot of flash and a lot of lens flares.
[00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:42.897]  That, I can almost assure you.
[00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:45.918]  I find your lack of faith disturbing.
[00:03:47.557 --> 00:03:52.778]  But I do have a new hope that he will do a better job than George Lucas in creating a stylistic masterpiece.
[00:03:53.618 --> 00:04:02.660]  And if you would like a complete history of false flags, pick up a copy of Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism, at the Infowars store, or you can watch it free on YouTube.
[00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:10.642]  Please write in the comments below which, in your mind, is the biggest false flag that we've seen since 1977, which is the year Star Wars premiered.
[00:04:11.702 --> 00:04:14.763]  This has been Rob Due with Infowars.com, and may the Force be with you!
[00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:32.680]  Good.
[00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:40.223]  The Force is strong with you.
[00:04:41.584 --> 00:04:45.586]  A powerful Sith you will become.
[00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:54.410]  Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth... Vader.
[00:04:58.083 --> 00:04:59.383]  Hi, I'm Shane Steiner.
[00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:02.684]  A lot of you have been following my progress using Supermale Vitality.
[00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:05.585]  The last 19 weeks has been an incredible experience.
[00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:11.027]  I was feeling a little down and lethargic during the holidays, and none of the supplements that I was taking were doing any good.
[00:05:11.187 --> 00:05:15.808]  That's when my longtime friend from high school, Alex Jones, introduced me to Supermale Vitality.
[00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:17.229]  I was a little skeptical at first.
[00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:26.315]  Not only would I have the energy to work out and go to the gym, but it was actually the changes were happening to my body a lot more rapidly.
[00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:30.397]  My whole mood, my libido, everything had completely changed.
[00:05:30.858 --> 00:05:37.462]  The concentrated organic herbs, they stimulate your natural systems to produce the natural hormones that you need.
[00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:49.189]  I just really wanted to bulk up and hit it hard and I went in for about the first five weeks and was lifting heavy weight and just really hitting it hard and I gained 20 pounds of muscle immediately.
[00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.010]  Since that, I've decided I was going to lose some weight and slim down.
[00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.212]  I just changed up my workout a little bit and 35 pounds came off.
[00:05:55.472 --> 00:05:56.553]  Folks, this is not a joke.
[00:05:56.733 --> 00:05:57.514]  This is not a gimmick.
[00:05:57.614 --> 00:05:58.114]  It's real.
[00:05:58.394 --> 00:05:59.315]  Super Male Vitality.
[00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:01.076]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
