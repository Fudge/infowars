[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.551]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com in Southern St.
[00:00:02.591 --> 00:00:03.852]  Louis with Jeffrey Wilson.
[00:00:04.152 --> 00:00:13.079]  Now this is the gentleman who contacted me via Facebook and let me know about the command center that was set up out here earlier today right behind the QT.
[00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.550]  We showed up.
[00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.211]  They've already left.
[00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:16.913]  There was a couple ambulances still back there.
[00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:18.454]  But what all did you see out there?
[00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:25.943]  Pretty much it was several different unmarked vehicles, a couple gentlemen in fatigues, a couple people with like the orange vests on.
[00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:28.346]  It looked like there was somebody with a large telephoto lens as well.
[00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:30.949]  Some ATVs, a couple of satellite trucks.
[00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.333]  Like I said, just a myriad of dark, unmarked vehicles is pretty much what I saw.
[00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:38.636]  And you said you had contacted the QT and asked them what they were doing there.
[00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:39.217]  What'd they tell you?
[00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:40.978]  Yeah, they were a little bit radio silent on it.
[00:00:41.018 --> 00:00:43.360]  They pretty much said they didn't really know what was going on.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.364]  They thought it was NSA or whatever, some of the other acronym agencies.
[00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:52.828]  They weren't really sure and they said it was DRILLS, which, you know, considering everything that was going on, I was a little dubious, but it might have been DRILLS.
[00:00:53.849 --> 00:01:00.455]  Yeah, well, we know that Governor Nixon said that he is going to activate the National Guard out here now.
[00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:03.197]  So, you know, it kind of falls in line with what's going on.
[00:01:03.217 --> 00:01:04.158]  They're going to try to prepare
[00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:05.392]  For what's going on.
[00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:09.476]  Well, you know about the gun sales in the area.
[00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:10.617]  They've gone up about 300%.
[00:01:10.877 --> 00:01:19.425]  Do you think the fact that people are being allowed to have the Second Amendment, is that going to affect the looting in any kind of way, you think?
[00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:21.697]  That's really hard saying.
[00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:33.000]  I mean, the looting, I mean, if the people are looting, they're obviously criminals and obviously, you know, guns fall into the hands of criminals oftentimes anyway, but the legal gun owners, I mean, I suggest the looters and such look out because this is St.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.541]  Louis, man.
[00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.141]  A lot of people are locked and loaded around here.
[00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:40.142]  And from what you've heard, do you think the verdict will come out this week?
[00:01:40.182 --> 00:01:44.344]  And if so, do you think it's going to not be as hyped up as it is?
[00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:49.265]  Or do you really think that things are going to hit the fan and it's going to be pretty chaotic like it was back in August?
[00:01:49.685 --> 00:02:08.874]  I had a bit of wishful thinking, thinking it was going to be Hyde because it seemed like there was just so much energy built up to it, but from what I'm seeing now just across the country in this preemptive calling of the National Guard in a state of emergency, it only kind of indicates to me that they have some intel possibly that something's going to go down because this is a pretty serious ramp up.
[00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:12.036]  And you live in the area, I mean you talk to people I'm sure day to day.
[00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:14.317]  Does the situation in Ferguson get brought up?
[00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:15.538]  About the verdict.
[00:02:15.698 --> 00:02:16.478]  Are there going to be riots?
[00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:17.899]  Do you hear a lot of chatter about that?
[00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:22.963]  You know, quite frankly, I mean, they've kind of drawn it out in the last couple weeks, but there is a bit of Ferguson fatigue.
[00:02:23.063 --> 00:02:29.107]  You know, a lot of people are tired of hearing of it, and there's other people who, you know, definitely want to keep it on the forefront.
[00:02:29.147 --> 00:02:32.289]  So, it kind of depends on where you live around here, you know what I mean?
[00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.074]  It's kind of some cultural differences, which makes people, some of them not care, and other people care probably more than they should.
[00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.877]  And as far as your safety, I mean, do you feel like
[00:02:43.257 --> 00:02:44.338]  You'll be fine around here?
[00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:48.001]  Do you worry about if the riots do happen?
[00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.643]  Do you think it's going to spread as far out as here to where we are now?
[00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.325]  Or do you think it'll just stay kind of...
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.462]  In the Ferguson-Clayton area around here.
[00:02:55.722 --> 00:02:59.745]  Well, there's a little bit of a rumor mill that's been going on since the whole thing started in August.
[00:03:00.086 --> 00:03:07.311]  I heard here in South City there was Molotov cocktails thrown at cop cars, killed a pig, spray painted, you know, throughout kind of South City.
[00:03:08.112 --> 00:03:14.037]  So, you know, like I said, I'm hoping for the best, but I'm planning for the worst.
[00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:15.619]  Well there you have it.
[00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.943]  People in Ferguson and the surrounding St.
[00:03:17.983 --> 00:03:23.051]  Louis area are preparing for the worst and you know, hoping for the best just like us as well.
[00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:24.654]  Stay tuned for more reports.
[00:03:24.794 --> 00:03:27.158]  Once again, I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
