[00:00:03.683 --> 00:00:17.171]  Alright, tonight I'm going to be joined by a Veterans Affairs employee who is a whistleblower and he contacted me the other day with some pretty disturbing information about corruption inside and files being shifted and names changed.
[00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:21.173]  Now I want to go to him and ask a few questions and see what he has to say.
[00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:24.214]  Alright, so thank you for joining the show today.
[00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:25.075]  How are you doing today, sir?
[00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:28.077]  I'm doing just fine.
[00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:30.298]  I just think that a couple of things need to come to light.
[00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:33.934]  And what would you like to tell us today?
[00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:41.597]  Well, to start, I think that the people need to know that this goes way past patient care.
[00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:46.439]  Even though patient care is top priority for our vets, I'm a veteran.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.603]  The corruption within the bureaucracy of the VA, at least here, it's overwhelming.
[00:00:55.643 --> 00:00:57.864]  What are some of the things that you've seen going on there?
[00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:05.989]  Well, one thing on the clinical side is they worry more about their own pockets than they do the patients.
[00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:16.174]  They want to stop working nurses and doctors on the weekends and replace them with students and residents.
[00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:21.137]  Now, however, I understand that there's probably going to be one doctor and probably one RN.
[00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:25.179]  However, this is putting our patients and our veterans
[00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:26.365]  At risk.
[00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:31.529]  I mean, you can't just put a student there by himself to take care of our veterans.
[00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.213]  So they had veterans taking appointments and working with the veterans?
[00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:39.235]  No, no, no.
[00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:49.462]  What they're talking about doing up in the ICUs is replacing the nurses and the doctors with students.
[00:01:50.663 --> 00:01:51.344]  Nursing students.
[00:01:52.486 --> 00:02:01.113]  So, have you, at your Veterans Affairs Center, are you going through the same long wait times there for soldiers to get their care?
[00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:35.751]  Since this is broken in the news, there has been an influx of patients so fast and so quick and so directly related to this that the parking lots are full constantly now.
[00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:42.035]  For the past week, there's been lines and lines and lines of people in the administration areas.
[00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:43.816]  They're shuffling boxes.
[00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:48.299]  I'm sure that there has been wait times.
[00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.203]  I personally have not had a wait time.
[00:02:51.243 --> 00:02:52.263]  I don't use that facility.
[00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:59.027]  But the influx of patients just recently, just to get them in the door.
[00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:00.147]  Let's get them in the door.
[00:03:00.187 --> 00:03:02.228]  It's a dog and pony show at this point.
[00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:12.713]  Now do you know of any, have you suffered any of the loss of lives with veterans due to lack of being seen and getting the appointments they need to catch things?
[00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:14.494]  I personally have not.
[00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:15.215]  However,
[00:03:17.148 --> 00:03:20.530]  There are suicides that have happened at that center.
[00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:29.757]  There are several times they've lost patients and haven't been able to find them and they just wander.
[00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:30.777]  It's a huge center.
[00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:36.241]  I mean, it's 250 some acres and they wander around and they can't find the patients.
[00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.603]  I mean, there's lack of care everywhere.
[00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:47.800]  As far as the deaths are concerned, I am not at that level at this center to be able to establish the facts on that end.
[00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:58.787]  Well, with the suicides you mentioned, now is this because the veteran affairs officials there, the doctors, they're not getting to the root of the problem?
[00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:01.269]  They're just instead medicating them?
[00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:02.289]  Yes.
[00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.993]  So there's an over-medication and not getting to the root of the problem with
[00:04:08.983 --> 00:04:11.338]  Group therapies and things like that happening at your center.
[00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:27.401]  Alright, so have you seen any evidence of them trying to alter or change records at the VA Center to make their VA Center look good overall on paper?
[00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:39.190]  It's called shuffling the books, and here recently there's been a very rapid race to move records, boxes, change labels.
[00:04:40.277 --> 00:04:46.880]  Whatever it may be, they're putting in rooms that nobody would look in, like if Joint Commission was to come, or the IG.
[00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:50.502]  These are rooms, like, that are used for other things, not records.
[00:04:51.763 --> 00:04:57.285]  And there's multiple times that I've seen, in the past week or so, them moving boxes.
[00:04:57.626 --> 00:05:05.029]  Oh, and speaking of audits, all the audit, this, you know, it only takes two years, they only do two years, so let's get rid of this and put it in here.
[00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.531]  So apparently they're hiding their tracks, somewhere.
[00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:16.799]  Now have you heard anyone from higher up as to why they're doing that or have you just kind of heard the whispers and seen them doing that?
[00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.680]  There's whispers and I've seen them doing it.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.881]  However, the higher ups are very quiet at this point.
[00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:35.864]  There was a lot of emails in the beginning about how this center is the best and of course that's with any center and how this situation that's going on in the news is not affecting us.
[00:05:36.204 --> 00:05:37.624]  There was an inspection going on.
[00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:46.841]  It's supposed to be last week and before that inspection things were happening and I could tell everybody could tell and nobody there is blind.
[00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:56.106]  Now have any of your superiors so to say come to you directly and said you know keep certain things that you hear hush-hush at all?
[00:05:56.846 --> 00:06:07.272]  There was a statement made it was a general statement not directed at me but directed at certain other employees including me that are veterans.
[00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:15.592]  Do you see what happens to the people that try to get things straight around here?
[00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:17.073]  They're not here anymore.
[00:06:17.513 --> 00:06:28.281]  Now that doesn't directly mean that they're going to fire us if we say something, but that's pretty telling of what they're trying to tell you.
[00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:41.132]  Yeah, it sounds like, you know, if you talk and you open your mouth and you try to bring something negative to the table and speak on anything negative happening, they do want to take action and fire.
[00:06:41.152 --> 00:06:42.673]  I mean, that's pretty ridiculous.
[00:06:42.713 --> 00:06:47.435]  I mean, we shouldn't have to, for you as an employee there, you shouldn't have to worry about that.
[00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:52.378]  You should be able to bring something like that to the front and get information on it.
[00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.064]  That would never happen for employees.
[00:06:55.564 --> 00:07:01.247]  The upper administration tries to keep things as tightly sealed as possible.
[00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:09.950]  There are veteran nurses that are veterans that are there and I have spoke with them and they see things beyond what I see.
[00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.492]  They see the lack of care with our veterans.
[00:07:14.032 --> 00:07:20.735]  They see the calling of board meetings for all the nurses for a uniform issue.
[00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:23.204]  Instead of worrying about the patients.
[00:07:23.464 --> 00:07:23.784]  Okay.
[00:07:23.804 --> 00:07:29.006]  This is a patient care issue Who cares right now about uniforms have to be this this and this?
[00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:40.852]  well, you know these these nurses are getting a little tired of it and They they want to speak out also, but the bureaucracy's gotten so scared It's really really they're kind of hush-hush.
[00:07:40.892 --> 00:07:47.254]  They talk to me, but they don't really want to go that much further What else have you seen up there in your time working there?
[00:07:47.274 --> 00:07:48.215]  And do you have any?
[00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:53.289]  Tips that maybe we could get out to the people to kind of help?
[00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:00.411]  They don't really hold the veteran at 100% like they should.
[00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:03.172]  This is the Department of Veterans Affairs.
[00:08:04.213 --> 00:08:13.816]  They hold their own pockets and their own self-worth at that center or in that system higher than they do the veterans.
[00:08:14.936 --> 00:08:17.917]  The things that I've seen are that you've got
[00:08:19.797 --> 00:08:20.218]  I don't know.
[00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:48.850]  Before they will hire that veteran, they will hire a family member of somebody who already works there.
[00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:54.879]  It's a huge bureaucracy, and it's a huge game, and somebody has to break the corruption.
[00:08:56.013 --> 00:08:57.194]  I mean, that's insane.
[00:08:57.214 --> 00:09:04.037]  They're not going to hire veterans at the Veterans Affairs Center right now, and they're only going to people who work there.
[00:09:04.057 --> 00:09:11.441]  I mean, that's how you keep that corruption inside, and by not allowing new, fresh, younger people in there with ideas.
[00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:13.842]  I mean, I can't believe that they're doing that.
[00:09:15.203 --> 00:09:20.147]  Well, you also have the point of, now I personally am not against non-veterans.
[00:09:20.307 --> 00:09:24.011]  I'm 100% for my veterans, but I'm not a non-veteran hater.
[00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:42.306]  However, you have supervisors and supervisory positions in this hospital that have been made statements, racial slurs against veterans have made statements that, you know, older veterans, they should just be taken outside and shot in the head because they're worthless.
[00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:47.390]  And this person still works there and he's still a supervisor.
[00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.590]  You tell me how long that is.
[00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:51.231]  That's very wrong.
[00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:54.172]  Has anyone filed a complaint or anything like that?
[00:09:54.232 --> 00:10:02.495]  Or are most people overall kind of scared to speak out because, you know, the threat of possibly losing their job and retirement and benefits?
[00:10:04.856 --> 00:10:05.176]  Both.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.221]  We have had people, I mean, that's not my issue.
[00:10:09.801 --> 00:10:16.563]  I heard it, but at the point in time I heard it, there was other veterans around, so I assumed they were going to take the charge.
[00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.384]  It was their supervisor.
[00:10:19.284 --> 00:10:25.106]  But I think they're so scared, because they've got them that scared, that they don't want to say anything.
[00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:31.808]  So what they do is, a couple of them will go to the union, and what the union does is just slap them on the wrist and say, okay, don't do that again.
[00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:34.746]  It's always being done by this person.
[00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:36.346]  It's ridiculous.
[00:10:36.406 --> 00:10:53.513]  I mean, how can you stop the corruption and the insanity if you have a supervisor that's a non-veteran saying these things to veterans, scaring them about their jobs and telling them that because you're an older veteran, you know, you ought to be taken outside and shot in the head.
[00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:55.874]  Well, hey, I got something to say to him.
[00:10:57.055 --> 00:11:02.477]  While he was wiping his butt, these guys were out there fighting in the fields for his freedom.
[00:11:03.118 --> 00:11:05.801]  How can he have the right to say that about them?
[00:11:06.642 --> 00:11:08.785]  But nobody says anything because it's an inside thing.
[00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:09.986]  It's kept in the walls.
[00:11:10.146 --> 00:11:10.807]  Hush, hush.
[00:11:11.688 --> 00:11:13.430]  So it's kind of like a death panel.
[00:11:13.991 --> 00:11:18.576]  I mean, they're saying that the older people, put them out to pasture.
[00:11:19.056 --> 00:11:19.657]  It's pointless.
[00:11:19.677 --> 00:11:20.318]  We don't need that.
[00:11:23.673 --> 00:11:29.515]  And, I mean, do you know of any lists, too, in regards to how the Phoenix VA Center was?
[00:11:30.095 --> 00:11:38.018]  Does your VA Center have a secret list, so to say, where they have a list of people that are being denied health care?
[00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:40.619]  I don't know about a list.
[00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:43.460]  I'm not at that level of the administration.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.020]  That's not my job.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.962]  However, there are veterans that work there that I've asked, oh, do you go here?
[00:11:50.774 --> 00:11:51.655]  You know, for your health care.
[00:11:51.675 --> 00:11:53.676]  Well, no, they they denied me health care.
[00:11:54.317 --> 00:11:56.178]  So how can they deny one veteran?
[00:11:56.758 --> 00:12:00.041]  And he was in the Navy and he served 10 years in the Navy.
[00:12:00.741 --> 00:12:05.785]  But they're going to accept somebody that did 18 months in the Marines and got kicked out for drugs.
[00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:07.546]  And he's in the health care system.
[00:12:08.567 --> 00:12:12.710]  However, this Navy veteran that did 10 years not denied health care.
[00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:15.432]  I know that for a fact.
[00:12:15.832 --> 00:12:17.093]  However, I don't know of any lists.
[00:12:17.782 --> 00:12:19.483]  I want to thank you for your time today, sir.
[00:12:19.563 --> 00:12:27.369]  I mean, it's, it's, I understand how, you know, scary it almost has got to be to just kind of come forward on an issue this big.
[00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:39.699]  You know, I appreciate you for your courage to come out and speak out because we need to get something like this taken care of because it is a number one priority to get our veterans the care that they deserve.
[00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:41.440]  I 100% agree with that.
[00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:43.982]  I don't want to thank you for your time.
[00:12:44.262 --> 00:12:45.503]  I don't want to thank you for what you're doing.
[00:12:46.392 --> 00:12:53.300]  I hope the people that hear this at least acknowledge the fact that there's a whole bunch of issues here.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.743]  There's more than just what you're seeing on TV.
[00:12:56.443 --> 00:13:00.107]  They're hiding a lot of things and you're never going to see it on the mass media.
[00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:03.671]  Well, I hope that over time as you find things out, you know,
[00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:06.743]  Keep in contact with me and let me know.
[00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:14.912]  And if you do know of any other people who would like to speak out and, you know, shine more light on this corruption, please contact me and let me know.
[00:13:14.972 --> 00:13:17.234]  And I, once again, thank you for being on the show tonight.
[00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:18.756]  Thank you very much.
[00:13:19.116 --> 00:13:19.617]  Have a nice day.
[00:13:20.037 --> 00:13:20.338]  You too.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.905]  Once again, I'd like to thank him for coming on tonight and thanks for watching tonight and we'll be back tomorrow.
