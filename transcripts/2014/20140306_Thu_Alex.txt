[00:00:01.331 --> 00:00:02.512]  Coast to coast.
[00:00:02.873 --> 00:00:04.174]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:08.139]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:15.143]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:16.825]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:18.707]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.347 --> 00:00:20.148]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:21.810]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.155]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:30.719]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:37.291]  Well, the radicalization of the Republican Party by the Tea Party accelerates.
[00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:39.594]  That's what the Democrats call it.
[00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:46.282]  They're only differentiating themselves from the socialist anti-liberty agenda of the Democrats, which will actually make them popular.
[00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:49.866]  That's what the Democrats squeal and yell and beg and plead and...
[00:00:51.164 --> 00:00:53.985]  Say whatever you do, don't be open pro-gun.
[00:00:54.445 --> 00:01:07.268]  So they've now got Mitch McConnell and others copying Charlton Heston, raising guns over their heads at the big Republican CPAC meeting, saying, for my cold dead hand, Ted Cruz comes out and says, abolish the IRS.
[00:01:08.308 --> 00:01:14.770]  There's others giving speeches about indicting Holder and indicting the IRS heads and others.
[00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.531]  This is the type of talk that could lead to real action
[00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:23.649]  And this is the way we could actually turn this country around.
[00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:24.790]  I mean, it can happen, folks.
[00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.571]  We're in the throes of deep corruption.
[00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:38.616]  And if the libertarian movement, the constitutional common sense Americana movement, the classical liberal movement... Notice I had Stefan Molyneux in here yesterday.
[00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:40.096]  He was calling us classical liberals.
[00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:42.798]  He's an anarchic capitalist.
[00:01:44.098 --> 00:01:45.699]  Why is he calling himself a classical liberal?
[00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.660]  Because that's what Thomas Jefferson was, folks.
[00:01:48.798 --> 00:01:56.787]  And Thomas Jefferson would look at the Democratic Party and the Republican leadership and would literally declare them the enemy.
[00:01:57.628 --> 00:02:02.554]  If you go off real liberal versus conservative systems.
[00:02:02.594 --> 00:02:08.801]  Conservative back in Thomas Jefferson's time meant you have elites that are above the law, don't pay taxes, and get their power from royalty.
[00:02:10.072 --> 00:02:13.239]  And a bunch of groups are protected, classes, and everybody else is a slave.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.643]  Thomas Jefferson said, you know, that's a really bad idea.
[00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:16.766]  People said, well, he had slaves.
[00:02:17.447 --> 00:02:19.251]  Yeah, and he started the movement to get rid of it.
[00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:22.773]  I also had about 20 children with them.
[00:02:22.793 --> 00:02:28.234]  But the point is, is that it was the ideas that led to more liberty later.
[00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:30.415]  They were the trailblazers.
[00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:36.416]  It's easy, 250 years later, to point back and go, well, I mean, these people were absolutely terrible.
[00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:42.597]  But they were trailblazing in their age, and their ideas led to greater forms of liberty today.
[00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:45.298]  And more and more it is about the definitions.
[00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:51.508]  We've got to get the proper definitions out there for people if we have any hope of ever changing things.
[00:02:51.548 --> 00:02:54.653]  By the way, a bunch of
[00:02:56.835 --> 00:03:11.825]  Establishment, authoritarian promoting publications with White House connections like Media Matters and Al Gore's Al Jazeera Network and all the rest of them came out and went into complete conniption fits since last Friday when Tucker Carlson was on.
[00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:13.986]  They're still going today and yesterday.
[00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:16.668]  MSNBC, more reports.
[00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.469]  Young Turks, more reports.
[00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.371]  I mean, every day this week from what I've seen, people are sending me the clips.
[00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:22.312]  I don't have time to watch them all.
[00:03:22.372 --> 00:03:22.832]  I watch two.
[00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:28.017]  They are freaking out over the fact that I have pointed out something that's totally public.
[00:03:29.618 --> 00:03:50.056]  And that is the fact that the Democratic Party was the party of the Ku Klux Klan, the Republicans got the Civil Rights Act passed, and so the Democrats by the mid-60s said we're going to lose everything if we don't branch out and double down and claim we're the party of minorities and give them a bunch of freebies.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:04.903]  And Cenk Sirk, he's an interesting talk show host, I'm not messing up his name on purpose, Cenk, Cenk, I got it right, there you go.
[00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:19.308]  He did these diatribes explaining, now Alex, it's true the Democrats were the party of the Klan up until the 60s, but the Republicans had the Southern strategy, and so they were the ones that were racist, and they flipped with the Democrats.
[00:04:19.328 --> 00:04:20.408]  Well, I said that in my rant.
[00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:24.108]  I said partially that was true because they were getting beat so bad.
[00:04:24.408 --> 00:04:28.470]  They said, fine, they've already got all the minorities that we actually were trying to free.
[00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.071]  We better go with the Southern strategy.
[00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:32.112]  That was Nixon.
[00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:35.613]  That was Nixon in the late 1960s.
[00:04:36.293 --> 00:04:37.494]  And it was purely political.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:50.569]  The point is it doesn't take away the LBJ quotes that are... If we let these, you know, n-words continue to be with the Republicans, it's over for our party.
[00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:56.314]  But we'll, you know, I'm gonna get all this great society passed and we'll have the n-words voting Democrat for 200 years.
[00:04:56.634 --> 00:04:57.815]  And those are quotes on record.
[00:04:58.255 --> 00:04:58.736]  So guess what?
[00:04:58.776 --> 00:05:03.180]  We're putting together whole reports about this every week from now forever.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.701]  We'll see how you like it.
[00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.223]  I'm gonna have all the Margaret Sanger quotes, all of them.
[00:05:07.964 --> 00:05:08.184]  Chink.
[00:05:09.582 --> 00:05:19.966]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.127]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:05:22.327 --> 00:05:23.027]  Fluoride!
[00:05:23.207 --> 00:05:24.788]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:31.450]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.515]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:42.702]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:05:42.962 --> 00:05:45.125]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:05:45.385 --> 00:05:48.008]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:05:48.308 --> 00:05:51.692]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:56.375]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:57.236 --> 00:06:02.040]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:17.388]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:24.752]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:06:24.872 --> 00:06:30.278]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:06:30.518 --> 00:06:34.242]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:57.661]  Hand cranked shortwave AM FM radios.

[00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:06.107]  What's his name?
[00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:34.314]  There is a war.
[00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:35.734]  It's happening now.
[00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:38.395]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:40.776]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:43.036]  We are the resistance.
[00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:45.057]  We are the Infowar.
[00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:51.783]  It is already Thursday, the sixth day of March 2014.
[00:08:52.543 --> 00:08:56.686]  I am Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:08:57.426 --> 00:09:03.269]  We are going to be live here for the next three hours, as we are all weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:09:03.289 --> 00:09:03.770]  to 2 p.m.
[00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:14.796]  Central, live, rebroadcast on stations all over the country, retransmitted, and then, of course, we return on Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m., for the abbreviated Sunday live transmission.
[00:09:16.277 --> 00:09:28.885]  David Knight will be hosting the Sunday show this Sunday, but I will be Skyping in for at least 30 minutes of the transmission, and we're going to be premiering some investigative reports on that broadcast as well.
[00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:32.008]  Anthony Gucciardi will also be in on the Sunday transmission.
[00:09:32.308 --> 00:09:34.069]  Just throwing that out before I forget.
[00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:45.957]  Tomorrow, before I get into what's coming up today, and there's a lot, we're going to premiere here last Friday's 35-minute-plus sit-down interview with Tucker Carlson before he came live.
[00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:51.663]  And it was very unscripted by him and is going to be controversial.
[00:09:52.535 --> 00:10:16.146]  If you think the last Friday's interview that ended up being all over MSNBC, Young Turks, every Democratic Party publication basically flipping out over it, if you think that that was a interesting interview, wait till you see this one, if you're a TV viewer, radio listeners will hear it, premiering in the second hour tomorrow.
[00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:17.767]  It'll fill up.
[00:10:18.677 --> 00:10:25.284]  Because we've added a lot of documentation and video and audio clips to what I'm debating with Tucker Carlson to the 35-minute interview.
[00:10:25.304 --> 00:10:27.426]  So it's probably 45 minutes long.
[00:10:27.847 --> 00:10:31.571]  It will fill all the airtime of the second hour tomorrow.
[00:10:32.737 --> 00:10:34.639]  Of the second hour tomorrow.
[00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:42.325]  Again, I don't really take full spring breaks where I take off five, six days with the family, but I take little pieces off, so I won't be live tomorrow.
[00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:47.669]  Myself, David Knight, will be in, but you will have several reports I've been working on.
[00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:56.116]  The Tucker Carlson interview, John Bowne's investigative report on the Democratic Party and their ties to race-baiting and the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:10:56.636 --> 00:11:01.660]  That's going to be premiering at 11.30, 30 minutes into the transmission tomorrow.
[00:11:03.002 --> 00:11:04.964]  I never saw it until now.
[00:11:05.304 --> 00:11:06.726]  I'm going to get the filmmaker on.
[00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:10.270]  It's called Runaway Slave that came out in 2012.
[00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.891]  We're going to play a trailer of that coming up.
[00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:18.479]  There's a black guy who actually knows all about this and made a film about it, exposing it.
[00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:30.582]  My only issue is, is I realize more and more just how conscious the modern Democrats are, and that they know all this, and that when we mention it, they run around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:11:30.962 --> 00:11:38.384]  Because the only way to defeat their racial division and race baiting, and the race wars they're trying to start, is to absolutely expose them.
[00:11:39.584 --> 00:11:40.584]  And they're scared of this.
[00:11:41.744 --> 00:11:43.525]  And quite frankly, the Republican leadership
[00:11:44.892 --> 00:11:51.998]  With Nixon and the Southern strategy starting in 68 on, they don't want this out.
[00:11:52.018 --> 00:12:00.725]  The Republican bluebloods don't want this out either because they want, they just flip sides with the Democrats and it was all basically a behind-the-scenes deal.
[00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:02.866]  So that doesn't get the Republicans off the hook either.
[00:12:03.287 --> 00:12:05.469]  It's just these are the big secrets they don't want you to know.
[00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:06.830]  And that's what we do.
[00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:13.295]  We take the big hiding in the elephant, you know, hiding in the living room elephant that's sitting there,
[00:12:14.758 --> 00:12:18.080]  The Conjoined Donkey and the Elephant and basically show what a monstrosity it is.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.841]  We're here to show you the hat tricks.
[00:12:20.401 --> 00:12:23.983]  In fact, they actually got the promo for Runaway Slave, the film.
[00:12:24.023 --> 00:12:24.683]  We don't sell it.
[00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:25.503]  We should.
[00:12:25.563 --> 00:12:25.964]  I've seen it.
[00:12:26.024 --> 00:12:26.524]  It's excellent.
[00:12:27.204 --> 00:12:27.885]  In the shopping cart.
[00:12:27.905 --> 00:12:28.925]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:37.890]  But here's a plug for that documentary that dovetails, here's the trailer, with the research we're doing and preparing to put out.
[00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.151]  We also sell the film M.A.F.A.
[00:12:41.371 --> 00:12:48.794]  Dealing with the eugenics program and the Democratic Party and Margaret Sanger and what they've been doing since the 20s.
[00:12:49.315 --> 00:12:51.135]  So we have been exposing this for a long time.
[00:12:51.155 --> 00:12:53.276]  It's just that it really scares the system.
[00:12:53.296 --> 00:12:55.517]  So we're going to play that trailer in a moment.
[00:12:55.537 --> 00:13:01.540]  And then the big news, obviously, is Crimea Parliament votes to join Russia.
[00:13:02.677 --> 00:13:03.758]  That is a big deal.
[00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:10.304]  And you've got talk of sanctions, talk of not letting Russians fly here with their visas, and vice versa.
[00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:11.865]  This is a new Cold War beginning.
[00:13:12.466 --> 00:13:14.588]  Absolutely no doubt about it.
[00:13:14.608 --> 00:13:17.591]  That story is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:13:18.051 --> 00:13:20.673]  Also up on DrudgeReport.com, four-story down in the middle column.
[00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:27.434]  On Infowars.com story, Missouri teachers object to being shot during drills.
[00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:32.318]  Missouri students and teachers required by law to participate in active shooter drills.
[00:13:32.358 --> 00:13:39.363]  And I'm going to explain exactly what's behind this coming up after we get into the Crimea situation.
[00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:43.707]  But because MSNBC, twice this week that I know of,
[00:13:45.464 --> 00:14:03.969]  And because the Young Turks, three times that I know of, and because all the big Democratic Party websites, all week long, following the talking points of Media Matters, have been running around freaking out, making fun of us, for pointing out the absolute historical fact that Eisenhower got the Voting Rights Act moving forward.
[00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:14.292]  The Civil Rights Act passed with Republicans, and it hurt the Democrats so bad that they then came back later and supported it.
[00:14:14.952 --> 00:14:27.500]  That brought in the Great Society, we have all the racist letters of LBJ, and all the rest, and we're just going to put it into a bunch of special reports, especially now that they're running around claiming that we're deceiving people.
[00:14:29.181 --> 00:14:42.450]  And going, hey, the Southern strategy, you know the Republicans said they were going to target the South after the Democrats began to lose the South because they went for the whole country with racial politics.
[00:14:43.803 --> 00:14:51.449]  They just shifted from their racial politics in the South to then flipping it to the rest of the country, racial identity politics with the minorities.
[00:14:51.970 --> 00:15:00.356]  The Republicans were actually trying to fuse the country into a nationalistic, free-market empire at the time.
[00:15:00.396 --> 00:15:03.479]  I'm not even saying it was perfect, but it was a lot better gold than the globalists have today.
[00:15:04.099 --> 00:15:06.862]  And they were actually trying to unify the nation post-World War II.
[00:15:07.262 --> 00:15:13.227]  The Democrats were not about to let that happen, came out with a very cynical, sophisticated, Machiavellian program.
[00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:28.887]  And so when Schenck, if I'm pronouncing it right, and others on the Young Turks and MSNBC get up there and go, Alex, you know full well the Democrats flip for being the racist party, the Republican Party.
[00:15:30.487 --> 00:15:31.448]  That's not really true.
[00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:35.389]  And you know the Southern strategy under Nixon came many years later.
[00:15:36.109 --> 00:15:38.590]  So they are really scared of this.
[00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.872]  And again, I've discovered whatever we report on that they freak out about,
[00:15:45.626 --> 00:15:49.450]  You know when they freak out and go, it's ridiculous that we want to ban your guns.
[00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.092]  Everybody knows we don't want to ban your guns.
[00:15:51.512 --> 00:15:53.755]  Now please stop playing the clips where we say we're going to ban them.
[00:15:54.636 --> 00:15:55.497]  That's because it's hurting them.
[00:15:55.917 --> 00:15:57.539]  And I'm going to go on hurting you.
[00:15:57.559 --> 00:15:58.861]  Because you're a bunch of tyrants.
[00:16:00.228 --> 00:16:09.773]  And when I mention the fact that they are the party of race politics and identity politics and class warfare, they get very upset, folks, because they're out in the open race-baiting.
[00:16:09.833 --> 00:16:18.537]  If you flipped the people on MSNBC into Klan uniforms from 50 years ago, I mean, it's the same rhetoric, folks, but for minorities.
[00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:19.077]  It is.
[00:16:19.397 --> 00:16:20.178]  That's what it is.
[00:16:20.598 --> 00:16:21.358]  Word for word.
[00:16:21.798 --> 00:16:22.639]  They flipped the script.
[00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:24.019]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.002]  So here is a trailer for the film that exposes this runaway slave.
[00:16:29.042 --> 00:16:29.302]  Here it is.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.843]  Pre-1960, most African Americans were Republicans.
[00:16:34.403 --> 00:16:39.747]  After Martin Luther King was freed from jail by John F. Kennedy, the African American vote has gone Democratic.
[00:16:39.887 --> 00:16:45.191]  What exactly did we get exchanged for our 95% Democratic swaying vote?
[00:16:45.512 --> 00:16:50.115]  We gave up 3 to 1 odds in abortion.
[00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:52.677]  14 million black babies have died since 1973.
[00:16:52.717 --> 00:16:53.838]  Dependent on welfare systems.
[00:16:57.628 --> 00:17:03.730]  They begin to take young women, and they begin to tell the young women, well, we will give you money, you just stay home.
[00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.371]  But what if I want to get married?
[00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:06.171]  You'll lose your benefits.
[00:17:06.391 --> 00:17:10.593]  When you remove the black man out of the house, the likelihood of the young black men going to jail increases by 60%.
[00:17:11.513 --> 00:17:16.095]  This is what this party has given on a platter to African Americans.
[00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:19.336]  Sometimes you can't tell the difference between now and 200 years ago.
[00:17:19.676 --> 00:17:20.536]  And we, by 95%, support this.
[00:17:23.795 --> 00:17:25.797]  Go on back to the plantation.
[00:17:26.377 --> 00:17:30.060]  You have a group of people on the plantation and we've run away.
[00:17:31.601 --> 00:17:32.122]  We ran away.
[00:17:32.162 --> 00:17:32.682]  We got free.
[00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:38.827]  The more the government gives us, the more debt and more control we accumulate.
[00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:43.991]  But here we come back to the plantation and we're telling them, y'all can be free.
[00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:51.397]  Anyone that comes along and talks to me about taking away what I've given you, they must be evil.
[00:17:51.698 --> 00:17:53.119]  They've got to be Republicans.
[00:17:54.687 --> 00:17:57.669]  We have 40, 50 years, an entire culture of people.
[00:17:57.969 --> 00:17:58.629]  This is all they know.
[00:17:58.649 --> 00:17:59.670]  They don't know anything else.
[00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:05.333]  Because see, in the black community, there's always somebody's gotta keep them niggas in control.
[00:18:05.493 --> 00:18:09.415]  You could call it slavery in the slave quarters, or now in the urban ghettos of America.
[00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:19.673]  I think life is about our future and making decisions that you feel like will serve you best.
[00:18:19.813 --> 00:18:25.314]  We have an opportunity in this nation as blacks that we could not find anywhere else.
[00:18:25.634 --> 00:18:28.475]  We the people are still in charge of this country!
[00:18:28.515 --> 00:18:35.516]  We've joined up with these people who are haters and they're racist, but they're not!
[00:18:35.856 --> 00:18:42.098]  All we're doing is telling the others that are still on the plantation, you can be free!
[00:18:44.315 --> 00:18:48.018]  This is not the land of guarantees, but it's the land of opportunity.
[00:18:48.198 --> 00:18:50.720]  The sky's the limit as to what we can achieve here.
[00:18:50.981 --> 00:18:56.525]  But when you say racism is the problem, you put the power for your future in someone else's hands.
[00:19:00.568 --> 00:19:04.231]  What we need in this country today is more black men to confront it.
[00:19:04.432 --> 00:19:06.633]  Because you as a white man, you can't confront it.
[00:19:06.714 --> 00:19:11.638]  Right now, if you said anything to the black community, you're gonna be accused of racism.
[00:19:11.758 --> 00:19:13.119]  I guess I'm racist too, right?
[00:19:18.194 --> 00:19:19.615]  Tyranny is colorblind.
[00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:20.875]  White or black.
[00:19:21.195 --> 00:19:22.296]  It will control you.
[00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:24.676]  Run America!
[00:19:25.117 --> 00:19:25.937]  Run faster!
[00:19:26.357 --> 00:19:27.077]  Don't give up!
[00:19:27.737 --> 00:19:28.538]  Don't give in!
[00:19:29.098 --> 00:19:29.998]  Are you tired yet?
[00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:31.759]  Run harder!
[00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:41.760]  Again, the film is Runaway Slave.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.141]  We're going to carry it, and we're going to get all those guys on the show.
[00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:54.926]  The point is, is that I've been covering this for 18, 19 years, but just kind of mentioning as a footnote, reading so much history, and I realize right in front of us, worldwide, governments want to get people on welfare.
[00:19:56.127 --> 00:19:59.429]  And if a country's half Catholic, half Protestant, they'll play those groups off against each other.
[00:20:00.123 --> 00:20:06.169]  Or if it's, you know, half animist in Africa and in some region, and half Christian, they'll play those groups off against each other.
[00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:07.710]  Even though it's black people.
[00:20:08.471 --> 00:20:10.073]  Again, or white people against white people.
[00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:12.735]  They will divide and conquer, just like Ukraine.
[00:20:13.135 --> 00:20:15.017]  Catholics against Orthodox.
[00:20:15.998 --> 00:20:21.563]  Slavs against Aryans, as they call themselves in Western Ukraine.
[00:20:22.604 --> 00:20:23.866]  And this is what they do.
[00:20:23.946 --> 00:20:24.947]  This is how they operate.
[00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:43.591]  And then you look at the social engineering of the eugenicist and the family courts that were set up, and if you look at how they were set up in England 120 years ago, set up here about 110 years ago, and places like New York City with the Rockefeller Foundation on record, and go look at who set them up.
[00:20:44.639 --> 00:20:45.740]  And it gets rid of the courts.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.445]  You see, you want to do a court to decide who got the kids, or you want to do a court to decide what was going to happen.
[00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:52.966]  No, now it's just a judge.
[00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:58.171]  And now it's a system where the health department decides, and the CPS decides.
[00:20:58.831 --> 00:21:01.153]  And, oh, we don't want fathers in the home.
[00:21:01.734 --> 00:21:07.779]  We want only women, and then the state is their husband, and we pay those women only enough to control them.
[00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.540]  And then we wonder why
[00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:13.562]  The statistic they were showing in that film is a 60% increase in prison.
[00:21:14.902 --> 00:21:29.965]  It's a several hundred percent increase in prison, and an 80% increase in illegitimacy, and a culture totally destroyed, and people who literally have no idea even what country they're in.
[00:21:30.865 --> 00:21:40.127]  And that's because the blacks were targeted as the test case, as Tony Brown has pointed out many times, the exact same formula is being done in every other community.
[00:21:41.618 --> 00:21:56.848]  I mean the general public, people that are raised by single parents on average, I'm not attacking single parents, they always act like if you point out the statistics that you're four times more likely to be on drugs, five times more likely to end up in prison, the number used to be three times, now five times, that you're going to have a life of poverty.
[00:21:57.729 --> 00:22:02.652]  Even if you come from a middle class or wealthy home and it's single parent, your kids statistically are totally screwed.
[00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:08.090]  Because they're biologically designed to be around a man and a woman and that interaction.
[00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.830]  It ends the human cycle.
[00:22:10.331 --> 00:22:11.311]  It ends the family.
[00:22:11.551 --> 00:22:12.831]  And the family's almost gone!
[00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:15.012]  The West is completely dying!
[00:22:15.692 --> 00:22:18.473]  And they're going into the third world and teaching people to get rid of their families.
[00:22:19.013 --> 00:22:27.335]  They're going into Africa and Asia and Latin America with micro-loans, and they advertise them like they're a great deal, and in most cases they're not, where they will give women maybe a $50 loan.
[00:22:29.892 --> 00:22:32.733]  And then have the women on TV and radio what stars they are.
[00:22:33.073 --> 00:22:36.875]  And then the few success cases, they're like payday loans.
[00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:38.675]  The women never even get out of the debt.
[00:22:38.975 --> 00:22:41.716]  Then they tell the women, that's all right, we'll forgive your debt.
[00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:50.619]  Just divorce your husband, kick him out of the house, and put your kids in a government-run dormitory where the state raises them, and you'll get them on the weekend.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:57.202]  And hey, honey, you can go after you work in the factory till eight o'clock at night without with your lady friends and have a drink.
[00:22:58.462 --> 00:22:59.985]  You can go out and have a little bit of fun.
[00:23:00.085 --> 00:23:04.955]  And see, breaking up the family, telling men, hey, you'll see your kids every other week.
[00:23:05.556 --> 00:23:06.578]  Go out and have a good time.
[00:23:07.898 --> 00:23:18.406]  Have your, you know, your mama baby at home, go knock up a bunch of women, and you can just drive around in your nice car and have a couple jobs and have a little bit of bling bling and be a big star.
[00:23:18.886 --> 00:23:22.069]  Yeah, it's fun for the individual to not be home with their kids sometimes.
[00:23:22.329 --> 00:23:29.534]  It's fun for the women to give their kids over to the state, leave them at school till 8, 9 at night, put them in programs with the government-run schools on the weekend.
[00:23:29.955 --> 00:23:33.798]  It's fun for you, but it ends humanity as we know it.
[00:23:34.844 --> 00:23:46.864]  And then long term, your kids don't come see you in the nursing home, there's no family reunions, people don't even visit their parents, because we've been turned black, white, I don't care, into animals.
[00:23:47.165 --> 00:23:48.206]  60% of the country's divorced.
[00:23:50.123 --> 00:24:05.491]  Men don't know what men are, women don't know what women are, and it has been done on record by the Eugenicist and by IBM and by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation and Carnegie Endowment, on record.
[00:24:05.852 --> 00:24:08.053]  Endgame 2.0, that's on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:09.093 --> 00:24:15.297]  Dr. Kaufman goes through all the government documents on how they were going to end heterosexuality to lower the population.
[00:24:16.445 --> 00:24:18.626]  Yeah, you got half the men with other men and half the women with other women.
[00:24:18.646 --> 00:24:19.446]  That'll cut it right there.
[00:24:20.187 --> 00:24:22.007]  And then you wage war against the family.
[00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:24.088]  It's not even a moral judgment against, quote, gay people.
[00:24:24.688 --> 00:24:33.372]  It's that it's scientifically being pushed, and no one can deny that, from every angle to break us up where we're total atomized
[00:24:35.077 --> 00:24:40.179]  Individuals, but not in the classical sense of an individual part of a family, part of a tribe, part of a group.
[00:24:40.419 --> 00:24:41.439]  There are no more tribes.
[00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:42.599]  There are no more cultures.
[00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:43.720]  There are no more people.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:54.183]  There's MTV, and CNN, and Fox News, and ESPN, and you tune in and you watch Friends, the show Friends.
[00:24:54.543 --> 00:24:59.985]  You don't actually have Friends, you watch the show Friends, to use an example from 15 years ago.
[00:25:01.073 --> 00:25:02.534]  And you have no identity.
[00:25:02.794 --> 00:25:05.296]  Your identity is whatever the television puts into you.
[00:25:08.718 --> 00:25:21.406]  And I am a runaway slave from the psychological warfare, artificial reality, matrix-like level, artificial habitat the globalists are trying to construct and trying to put us into.
[00:25:21.426 --> 00:25:24.448]  That's what's going on here.
[00:25:26.528 --> 00:25:28.029]  I want everyone to be free.
[00:25:28.489 --> 00:25:31.891]  I want everyone to realize how much potential and human power they have.
[00:25:32.191 --> 00:25:35.453]  And I want them to realize that their individuality is under attack.
[00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:54.865]  The globalists sell a fake, synthetic form of individuality where, oh, you're an individual, you don't have a family, you don't have really any real friends that would ever come to your aid, but you've got a culture, a plastic, fake corporate culture that's put out that you buy into that empowers you.
[00:25:56.561 --> 00:26:07.203]  This morning I was working out at the gym and they had an ad, I think it was for Xbox or PlayStation, I meant to write a note, I forgot, but it was something like, you know, dare to be great, dare to be somebody.
[00:26:10.091 --> 00:26:13.675]  It showed a bunch of pirates fighting with each other, but they're blurring reality.
[00:26:13.755 --> 00:26:18.581]  They showed real actors fighting as pirates and then cut to the video game of pirates killing each other.
[00:26:19.342 --> 00:26:24.148]  You can go out and kill each other and be on the high seas and be in real battles, but never actually be in a real battle.
[00:26:24.428 --> 00:26:26.090]  You can go and buy a Ferrari for $1,000.
[00:26:27.612 --> 00:26:34.938]  In Second Life, or whatever it is, and all these other virtual realities, and then people really think you're cool in a fantasy world, but it's not real.
[00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:38.621]  That is humans being inserted into the Matrix.
[00:26:38.882 --> 00:26:55.636]  The Globalists said 50 years ago they were going to develop virtual reality games that would become indistinguishable, like the holodeck in Star Trek, from reality, until you would choose the fake, easy reality over the hard, true reality that is actually rewarding.
[00:26:57.625 --> 00:27:04.387]  Yeah, I would imagine if you were in a few dozen sea battles with real cutlasses and blunderbuss, hacking people up, you'd be pretty tough.
[00:27:06.167 --> 00:27:09.448]  But you're not really in sea battles when you go and play those video games.
[00:27:11.048 --> 00:27:18.570]  I would imagine if you flew around Vietnam in a helicopter, you know, getting shot at and shooting at people, that would be a life experience.
[00:27:19.151 --> 00:27:20.331]  Because people are really dying.
[00:27:21.542 --> 00:27:29.965]  The virtual reality isn't real, and the virtual reality is bigger than all these video games that say, dare greatly, you know, be somebody.
[00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:46.832]  I was sitting there, during like a 30 second break working out, because the way I was starting to work out, there's like no breaks basically, but I stopped and paused, and I'm sitting there looking at it, and it was saying things on the screen like, be somebody, be part of an adventure, your life starts now.
[00:27:47.192 --> 00:27:49.233]  No, your life begins to end
[00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.531]  In these false realities.
[00:27:53.452 --> 00:27:55.274]  And the media says, hey, don't listen to him.
[00:27:55.834 --> 00:27:57.695]  This is something that'll make you feel like a human being.
[00:27:57.916 --> 00:27:59.417]  Yeah, because they take away our cultures.
[00:27:59.657 --> 00:28:01.538]  They take away our normal rites of passage.
[00:28:01.818 --> 00:28:04.120]  They take away the feminine and male rites of passages.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.481]  They destroy our families.
[00:28:05.741 --> 00:28:06.682]  We don't know anything better.
[00:28:06.882 --> 00:28:08.963]  We're sat down in front of a television from birth.
[00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:10.825]  And it's our girlfriend.
[00:28:10.945 --> 00:28:11.805]  It's our boyfriend.
[00:28:11.946 --> 00:28:12.746]  It's our father.
[00:28:13.086 --> 00:28:13.787]  It's our mother.
[00:28:13.907 --> 00:28:14.868]  It's our ancestor.
[00:28:15.148 --> 00:28:16.229]  It's our guru.
[00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:17.850]  It's our Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.071]  It's our guide.
[00:28:20.037 --> 00:28:20.618]  No, it's not.
[00:28:21.098 --> 00:28:27.665]  It's an artificial construct where the enemy can reach through and openly program you any way they want.
[00:28:29.668 --> 00:28:34.893]  Literally, ladies and gentlemen, I could dress up like a trendy, grow a beard, and I'm not knocking you to grow a beard.
[00:28:34.933 --> 00:28:35.714]  Hey, it's working for you.
[00:28:36.455 --> 00:28:38.918]  And go out on the street and have women throw themselves at me.
[00:28:40.962 --> 00:28:53.175]  I could literally do all the fake things that the media says do and have success, but it would be with other plastic, non-real people who will never be fulfilled and empowered and who aren't real.
[00:28:53.816 --> 00:28:59.101]  Because it's true, the globalists want to make us unconscious, programmable, biological androids in their own words.
[00:28:59.362 --> 00:29:03.105]  If you're not self-actuating and actually guiding your own development,
[00:29:03.746 --> 00:29:08.348]  And consciously understanding yourself and knowing thyself, you are not conscious.
[00:29:08.428 --> 00:29:09.268]  You are not real.
[00:29:09.568 --> 00:29:10.809]  You are not even a person.
[00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:11.849]  You're not living.
[00:29:12.089 --> 00:29:13.690]  No wonder you're so unhappy.
[00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:14.630]  No wonder.
[00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:21.313]  And you run after the false plastic synthetic construct as if it's going to empower you.
[00:29:22.884 --> 00:29:31.911]  I see the young men trying to dress up like Jay-Z and stuff, and trying to take on these trappings of success, believing that's going to give them success within the system.
[00:29:32.151 --> 00:29:32.551]  It's not.
[00:29:32.992 --> 00:29:38.716]  It's all a hologram that you believe you buy into, and that you're empowered when you're in a matrix.
[00:29:39.036 --> 00:29:39.677]  It's not real.
[00:29:39.697 --> 00:29:41.398]  You understand that?
[00:29:42.439 --> 00:29:46.903]  When you play some boxing game and beat Muhammad Ali, you didn't really beat Muhammad Ali.
[00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:53.915]  You would get more fulfillment going and joining a boxing club, and three years later, beating somebody who beat you at first.
[00:29:54.275 --> 00:29:56.237]  That would be a thousand times more fulfilling.
[00:29:56.577 --> 00:29:58.838]  Not the fake, synthetic garbage.
[00:29:58.998 --> 00:29:59.798]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.818 --> 00:30:00.679]  Not the prosthesis.
[00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:01.920]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.881]  Not the image of the real thing.
[00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:05.622]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:05.642 --> 00:30:06.082]  I want real!
[00:30:06.342 --> 00:30:07.543]  Give it to me now!
[00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:14.264]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:30:14.404 --> 00:30:17.368]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:30:17.528 --> 00:30:22.753]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:30:23.094 --> 00:30:24.756]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:30:25.036 --> 00:30:26.357]  We are what we eat.
[00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:28.560]  Our food is devoid of nutrition.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.641]  We're good to go.
[00:30:54.341 --> 00:31:00.166]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:15.981]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over
[00:31:15.981 --> 00:31:16.721]  We're good to go.
[00:31:34.187 --> 00:31:39.890]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.912]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[00:32:09.267 --> 00:32:12.629]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:32:12.709 --> 00:32:14.950]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:20.313]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[00:32:20.453 --> 00:32:20.994]  We're good to go.

[00:33:20.976 --> 00:33:24.001]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:24.562 --> 00:33:28.729]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:51.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, we are live on this Worldwide Thursday Transmission.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:34:03.603]  Dr. Ed Group is going to be joining us, looking at some of the most common toxins that are in the water, the food supply, and how to avoid them, and also looking at some of the latest medical news.
[00:34:04.263 --> 00:34:05.723]  That is all coming up.
[00:34:07.264 --> 00:34:14.105]  And then Ben Swan is scheduled, he's here in Austin, of benswan.com and his own alternative media group.
[00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:24.597]  He is going to be joining us coming up in studio as well during this worldwide transmission here today.
[00:34:25.838 --> 00:34:42.430]  But before we go any further, I want to start to break down the situation that is unfolding in the Ukraine, the Ukrainian
[00:34:43.786 --> 00:34:46.755]  Government has voted to join with the Russians.
[00:34:47.677 --> 00:34:50.345]  This has escalated the situation.
[00:34:51.676 --> 00:34:52.256]  Quite a bit.
[00:34:52.317 --> 00:34:55.899]  Again, Crimea votes to join Russia, accelerating Ukraine crisis.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.182]  That is what is being reported by Reuters.
[00:35:00.983 --> 00:35:05.847]  And they're talking about sanctions against Russia now becoming somewhat of a certainty.
[00:35:06.287 --> 00:35:07.788]  First, they were talking about them a few days ago.
[00:35:07.848 --> 00:35:13.492]  Now they're saying they're going to try to get them in place via the State Department, NATO and the EU.
[00:35:15.063 --> 00:35:20.134]  There's talk of not letting Russians come here or travel into the EU, you name it, with their visas.
[00:35:21.096 --> 00:35:22.318]  These are really acts of war.
[00:35:23.954 --> 00:35:29.837]  uh... that are being discussed when what we are not defending the russian position it's just that the west did foment this.
[00:35:29.857 --> 00:35:31.278]  They did overthrow an elected government.
[00:35:32.058 --> 00:35:37.921]  Russia secured its gas pipelines in its port and it's seventy five percent russian in the area they grabbed.
[00:35:37.961 --> 00:35:50.006]  It's a small area of eastern ukraine and uh... you now have confrontations going on the last four or five days that have been on television with ukrainian troops marching up to russian bases that have been there forever
[00:35:52.077 --> 00:35:52.377]  I don't know.
[00:36:13.208 --> 00:36:18.793]  Watching some of the committee hearings from yesterday with McCain, and he's making more statements today.
[00:36:18.813 --> 00:36:23.897]  It was the most canned garbage I've ever seen to Secretary of Defense Hagel.
[00:36:25.498 --> 00:36:26.399]  And the clips are out there.
[00:36:26.419 --> 00:36:33.124]  He was saying, how can you be cutting the Pentagon budget right as the Russians invade Ukraine?
[00:36:33.705 --> 00:36:35.707]  This could not be worse, was his quote.
[00:36:36.968 --> 00:36:39.029]  And what are we going to do?
[00:36:39.089 --> 00:36:41.972]  You notice the day that we cut defense spending,
[00:36:43.325 --> 00:36:47.967]  Last week, the Russians invaded as if that's why they invaded.
[00:36:49.567 --> 00:36:52.689]  They cut some of the increase in defense spending.
[00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:56.030]  Some of the increase in defense spending.
[00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:03.653]  The United States spends half, half, look it up, of the world's money on defense.
[00:37:04.273 --> 00:37:05.954]  All other countries combined are the other half.
[00:37:06.314 --> 00:37:06.634]  Look it up.
[00:37:08.403 --> 00:37:09.764]  Guys, just type it in for TV viewers.
[00:37:09.804 --> 00:37:13.786]  Type in US accounts for half of world's defense spending.
[00:37:13.806 --> 00:37:15.007]  It'll show all sorts of graphs.
[00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:17.028]  Some cases it's 54%, 51, 52.
[00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:19.790]  I'm just saying half to be safe.
[00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.451]  With the cuts, it's about half.
[00:37:22.752 --> 00:37:24.853]  And then meanwhile, China just boosted their defense spending 12%.
[00:37:24.893 --> 00:37:26.875]  They've been doing that every year for a while.
[00:37:28.075 --> 00:37:29.436]  And we're giving them our secrets.
[00:37:29.476 --> 00:37:36.981]  I mean, I don't want to hear about national defense while our government basically hands out all the secrets to everybody.
[00:37:37.915 --> 00:37:44.778]  They just showed the pie chart from Wikipedia showing the United States being roughly half of world spending.
[00:37:44.818 --> 00:37:46.198]  Some of the pie charts show it 49%, 48%.
[00:37:46.819 --> 00:37:52.361]  But technically, if you add the supplemental and black budget, it's way over 50%.
[00:37:52.601 --> 00:38:07.567]  The point is that the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about in 1961 is run by these offshore globalist banks and is openly trading with NORTHCOM for sedition and criminal oppression.
[00:38:09.236 --> 00:38:11.296]  of patriots and Tea Party people.
[00:38:11.897 --> 00:38:19.258]  So, again, I'm not bashing the military personnel themselves, I'm bashing the directives coming out of the globalists that control the federal government.
[00:38:21.058 --> 00:38:29.640]  But it really hit me this morning when I was watching that at about, you know, 7 a.m., watching those... I say I watched the news, I was watching the hearings from yesterday on YouTube.
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:35.361]  I don't really tune into mainstream television very often unless I see it in the background or monitor it here in the office.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.821]  We keep an eye on it, but we mainly get it from the aggregators.
[00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:42.183]  The point is, is that it hit me.
[00:38:42.343 --> 00:38:49.887]  Of course, one reason they started this attack a few weeks ago was because they didn't vote to join the EU to be sucked dry.
[00:38:50.387 --> 00:38:52.588]  But more than that, it's just they need a new Cold War.
[00:38:53.369 --> 00:38:55.450]  They've told us, don't worry about Al-Qaeda anymore.
[00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.171]  They're our buddies.
[00:38:58.251 --> 00:39:03.634]  The new domestic enemies, the Tea Party and gun owners and veterans and libertarians and conservatives.
[00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:14.484]  So that's what NORTHCOM's for, and the international enemy is the Russkies and the Chai-comps, who the globalists are arming to the teeth.
[00:39:15.285 --> 00:39:17.108]  But Russia is a real enemy of these people.
[00:39:17.898 --> 00:39:32.947]  Because they're not controlled by the globalists because they kicked a whole bunch of oligarchs out post 1991, 92, 93, 94, when Yeltsin became a total drunk and just sat at the back while Putin, his vice president, actually ran the show.
[00:39:33.007 --> 00:39:35.669]  I mean, Putin's been the president probably since about 93.
[00:39:35.709 --> 00:39:40.572]  And then in 99, officially, when Yeltsin could no longer stand up or talk.
[00:39:41.916 --> 00:39:42.817]  They're probably drugging him.
[00:39:42.837 --> 00:39:43.257]  Who knows?
[00:39:43.277 --> 00:39:46.179]  You know, became the El Presidente.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.362]  So that's just some of what's going on here in the background.
[00:39:50.402 --> 00:39:51.383]  But it just hit me.
[00:39:53.704 --> 00:39:55.826]  Why do they want a 12-year war in Iraq?
[00:39:55.866 --> 00:39:58.147]  A 12-year war in Afghanistan?
[00:39:58.167 --> 00:39:59.368]  Or an 11-year war in Iraq?
[00:39:59.388 --> 00:40:00.809]  12, 13-year war in Afghanistan?
[00:40:03.371 --> 00:40:06.013]  In their own words, they want trillions in no-bid contracts.
[00:40:06.073 --> 00:40:06.993]  They want the war.
[00:40:07.334 --> 00:40:08.975]  The journey is the destination.
[00:40:10.526 --> 00:40:16.808]  They want overstressed, burnout, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 tour trips to come back and be cops.
[00:40:17.268 --> 00:40:21.809]  They... War is the health of the state, it has been said by many a historian.
[00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.570]  I forget who originally said it, but you got to search engine that.
[00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.751]  Who said, quote, war is the health of the state?
[00:40:30.012 --> 00:40:30.712]  It was Bismarck?
[00:40:32.293 --> 00:40:40.155]  The point is, von Bismarck, I know he said similar things, von Bismarck of Deutschland,
[00:40:42.967 --> 00:40:51.210]  And you sit here and you watch this happening as the state grows and the groups that are around the state get bigger and they destroy the economy, but they don't care because they're like a cancer.
[00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:52.450]  They just grow and grow and grow.
[00:40:52.750 --> 00:41:05.615]  And then John McCain, the guy that was over there last year when he wasn't in Syria trying to fund Al-Qaeda, stirring up the ultra-anti-Russian, Ukrainian, white supremacist nationalists.
[00:41:05.635 --> 00:41:06.395]  I mean, that's who they are.
[00:41:08.516 --> 00:41:11.257]  And you've got George Soros involved, the famous Nazi collaborator.
[00:41:12.051 --> 00:41:15.033]  And it just shows you, everything they claim they are, they're the opposite.
[00:41:15.413 --> 00:41:17.014]  Give your rights up, Al-Qaeda's gonna hit us.
[00:41:17.054 --> 00:41:20.435]  Meanwhile, McCain's running Al-Qaeda, for all intents and purposes, to a great extent.
[00:41:21.416 --> 00:41:23.677]  George Soros, you know, shot down free speech in America.
[00:41:24.037 --> 00:41:25.338]  Pro-gun is pro-Nazi.
[00:41:25.598 --> 00:41:26.738]  Meanwhile, he's a real Nazi.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:35.063]  They say that Randolph Bourne said it in 1918, war is the health of the state.
[00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:41.186]  Yeah, but I think he was paraphrasing von Bismarck, but search Bismarck.
[00:41:42.386 --> 00:41:43.987]  War is the health of the state.
[00:41:44.007 --> 00:41:46.748]  It doesn't matter.
[00:41:46.788 --> 00:41:50.769]  The point is, it is the health of the state, at the expense of everybody else's health.
[00:41:50.809 --> 00:41:52.110]  But here are the headlines.
[00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:59.253]  McCain lashes Defense Secretary Hagel over cuts to Pentagon budget.
[00:41:59.393 --> 00:42:01.353]  Total and complete theater.
[00:42:02.194 --> 00:42:05.235]  Timing is exquisite, Senator says in sardonic questioning.
[00:42:06.912 --> 00:42:19.300]  And again, it goes over the quote about, quote, the timing is exquisite, offering a sharply reduced budget when the world is probably more unsettled than any time since World War II, Senator John McCain derisively declared Wednesday.
[00:42:19.881 --> 00:42:30.148]  The Arizona Republican did not disguise his chagrin with the reduced budget as he sardonically sparred with Defense Secretary Hagel at the Senate budget presentation.
[00:42:30.968 --> 00:42:40.494]  And depending on how you slice it, I guess they are cutting the increase in the Pentagon budget that's never been cut, basically, since 88 or so.
[00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:43.296]  They are cutting the increase by about half.
[00:42:45.177 --> 00:42:49.479]  And as Rand Paul has said, they should be cutting the defense budget by 20%, I mean, and consolidating it.
[00:42:49.499 --> 00:42:51.020]  I mean, we're going bankrupt, folks.
[00:42:51.601 --> 00:42:52.881]  But again, the globalists want that.
[00:42:52.901 --> 00:42:54.222]  They want us totally in debt.
[00:42:54.522 --> 00:43:00.086]  The real national security threat is our jobs shipped to the third world, our industry, our infrastructure falling apart.
[00:43:00.686 --> 00:43:02.346]  Our government attacking our culture.
[00:43:02.406 --> 00:43:04.207]  Our government attacking the birth rate.
[00:43:04.627 --> 00:43:06.187]  Our government de-industrializing us.
[00:43:06.487 --> 00:43:17.090]  Our government bringing in the largest immigrant populations any country has ever absorbed and then programming them with anti-nationalistic, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-gun propaganda.
[00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:22.251]  The national security threat is transferring our secrets to China and every other country that wants them.
[00:43:22.931 --> 00:43:26.172]  Our national security threat is the foreign mega-banks that have stolen
[00:43:27.112 --> 00:43:36.097]  Over $47 trillion in the last six years since 2008, pumping it into their coffers, who've signed us on to $1.5 quadrillion.
[00:43:36.597 --> 00:43:38.759]  I should do a special report about the real national security threat.
[00:43:38.779 --> 00:43:41.800]  I guess I'm doing one right now, but show all the documents, all the articles, all the clips.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:49.985]  We are fully conquered by a corporate kleptocracy that operates through administrative law and through shenanigans.
[00:43:52.597 --> 00:44:03.768]  And it's operating, and we're thinking of the old military threat, where an enemy or a tribe over the hill comes and tries to take your watering hole, or comes and tries to hunt in your hunting area, and you don't run them off, so next they're grabbing your women.
[00:44:04.489 --> 00:44:14.779]  You're thinking at a 10,000 BC level, folks, and the globalists are running around in suits and ties, conquering everything, and now they want to secure their usurpation, they want to
[00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:23.685]  Secure their usurper role, and so they are engaged in active war against the cattle that is the general public.
[00:44:24.546 --> 00:44:43.540]  And denigrating the health and vigor of the species, and of course the hundredth monkey, and epigenetics, and all of the science that shows what goes around comes around, the elite are destroying themselves by engaging in predator activities against the general population.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.520]  That is the big issue.
[00:44:46.241 --> 00:44:49.502]  And I'm glad they were able to find the article with the quotes, because it was just blowing me away this morning.
[00:44:50.842 --> 00:45:01.485]  McCain blasts Hagel for massive failure of intel on Ukraine, like they didn't know that when they went in and overthrew the government, that the Russians wouldn't come and grab their gas pipelines on their border.
[00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:04.206]  And then, oh my gosh!
[00:45:04.946 --> 00:45:07.587]  Oh, we gotta have sanctions and basically have war with Russia.
[00:45:07.607 --> 00:45:10.588]  You know, info war, as the Russians have been calling it.
[00:45:10.628 --> 00:45:12.849]  That's what they say they're being hit by, and that's what they are being hit by.
[00:45:14.332 --> 00:45:16.894]  And again, it's not that I'm saying Russia is wonderful or good.
[00:45:17.274 --> 00:45:18.295]  They didn't start it.
[00:45:18.595 --> 00:45:21.417]  The globalists are playing America and Russia off against each other.
[00:45:21.757 --> 00:45:25.860]  Will you guys queue up from Russia with love for me again, the Siamese fighting fish?
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.661]  I want to explain this to people again.
[00:45:27.941 --> 00:45:38.268]  The globalists are like big clouds, as John Perkins, the economic hitman, said, that orbit around the countries, organizing crises, organizing problems.
[00:45:38.308 --> 00:45:38.629]  It's like
[00:45:39.289 --> 00:45:44.373]  The Star Trek 9-11 piece that one of our listeners put together, explaining problem, reaction, solution.
[00:45:46.774 --> 00:45:52.539]  There was a real case, and I guess they compartmentalized it into the movie American Hustle.
[00:45:53.639 --> 00:45:56.201]  So I guess that was a racket, went on a lot in New York and New Jersey.
[00:45:56.662 --> 00:46:03.787]  There was a famous case, though, where the guy had billboards up all over New York saying, you know, we got the cheapest windshield repair.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.204]  We can fix your windshield if it has a small crack or whatever.
[00:46:08.504 --> 00:46:11.888]  He'd go around the ball peen pamer at night, breaking hundreds of windows.
[00:46:12.388 --> 00:46:13.930]  And he became filthy rich off of it.
[00:46:14.631 --> 00:46:16.132]  Because there'd be a billboard right there.
[00:46:16.433 --> 00:46:22.560]  And the public would wonder why at the end of a street, every few nights someone would bust the windshields out, why there was a sign there.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.362]  And obviously he was paying the cops off to let him do it.
[00:46:25.691 --> 00:46:26.952]  I mean, this is the oldest trick in the book.
[00:46:27.433 --> 00:46:35.681]  You go in, you start a fight with the Russians, the EU gets to come in and grab half the country and loot it, you get to have trillions more in defense spending, get to launch a whole new Cold War.
[00:46:36.021 --> 00:46:37.002]  Gee, where's the motive?
[00:46:38.744 --> 00:46:41.347]  I'd like to see that going into space programs.
[00:46:41.407 --> 00:46:44.790]  I'd like to... I'd like... I'd like to...
[00:46:45.942 --> 00:46:50.746]  I'd like to see it going into real research, real renaissance, real human empowerment.
[00:46:51.307 --> 00:46:54.730]  I'd like to see it going as tax money back into people's own pockets.
[00:46:55.671 --> 00:46:59.134]  I'd like to see real renaissance, not a system
[00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:03.290]  Where we just let these social engineers play all these games.
[00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.651]  And you've got more and more world leaders coming out.
[00:47:05.691 --> 00:47:06.811]  There was one just a few months ago.
[00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:07.572]  Who was that?
[00:47:08.152 --> 00:47:13.094]  That said governments are creating crises so they can stay in power and expand their control.
[00:47:13.874 --> 00:47:15.855]  And it's making the world very unstable.
[00:47:16.615 --> 00:47:18.796]  The top statesman, I forget who, Paul Watson wrote about it.
[00:47:20.802 --> 00:47:28.564]  Instead, we're going to end up having World War III or a total breakdown of society because these people don't want things to run well because they always need a crisis to stay in power.
[00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:29.165]  That's it.
[00:47:29.725 --> 00:47:31.825]  People say, well, Alex, aren't you glad stuff's bad?
[00:47:32.406 --> 00:47:33.886]  You know, you're doing real well on air.
[00:47:34.386 --> 00:47:36.767]  And quite frankly, I'll be honest with you right now.
[00:47:38.727 --> 00:47:43.069]  Yes, as things get worse, because I've been accurately telling you how the world really works,
[00:47:43.959 --> 00:47:46.080]  Because it's public how it really works.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.620]  It's not rocket science stuff, folks.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:52.141]  They just put out so much disinfo, when you actually hear the truth, people don't recognize it.
[00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:53.322]  You're hearing how it really works.
[00:47:53.562 --> 00:47:55.802]  You're really hearing how the planet operates.
[00:47:55.822 --> 00:48:05.525]  You're actually getting geopolitics from someone who's read 500 or more history books from mainline empires, Machiavelli, you name it.
[00:48:06.145 --> 00:48:08.306]  And all the establishment knows what I know and more.
[00:48:10.051 --> 00:48:11.912]  But I want a future for my kids.
[00:48:12.252 --> 00:48:13.673]  I would love for things to get better.
[00:48:13.833 --> 00:48:15.273]  There's always tyranny to fight.
[00:48:15.613 --> 00:48:17.034]  There's always corruption to deal with.
[00:48:17.914 --> 00:48:19.815]  But I would not fight as hard.
[00:48:19.855 --> 00:48:20.696]  I would not work as hard.
[00:48:20.756 --> 00:48:22.036]  I would fade off into the distance.
[00:48:25.198 --> 00:48:29.339]  I wouldn't be risking my life being so aggressive if we could back them off some.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.841]  But I realize there's no future if we don't beat them.
[00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:34.822]  I'm not happy about our meteoric rise.
[00:48:36.721 --> 00:48:38.003]  Because things are getting worse.
[00:48:38.643 --> 00:48:39.865]  I wish that wasn't the case.
[00:48:41.627 --> 00:48:46.672]  But the good news is we're getting bigger because people realize that it really is this bad.
[00:48:47.013 --> 00:48:53.781]  And by admitting how bad it is, therein lies the key to admitting we're in trouble and getting out of this situation.
[00:48:55.387 --> 00:49:07.277]  But absolutely, you bet, if the new rule continues moving forward, I will get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until I ultimately sell out to them or are murdered.
[00:49:08.823 --> 00:49:13.027]  And quite frankly, I'm never going to sell out, so I don't like approaching the territory we're going into.
[00:49:13.627 --> 00:49:21.695]  They've got all their metrics and computer programs, and the day my card pops up, that I become too dangerous and uncontrollable, they will either set me up or kill me.
[00:49:22.015 --> 00:49:22.535]  But you know what?
[00:49:22.635 --> 00:49:24.417]  That's what it takes to defeat tyrants.
[00:49:24.657 --> 00:49:26.319]  My ancestors did it, I'm ready to do it.
[00:49:26.499 --> 00:49:27.300]  That's not heroic.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.542]  I don't want my kids and grandkids being slaves.
[00:49:30.002 --> 00:49:31.844]  I don't like cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[00:49:32.972 --> 00:49:34.193]  I don't like the GMO.
[00:49:34.313 --> 00:49:36.955]  I don't like being in a giant petri dish experiment.
[00:49:37.336 --> 00:49:48.284]  Let's go to the clip from Russia With Love, where the head of Spectre, or is it Chaos, I forget, is explaining to them how they play Russia and the U.S.
[00:49:48.364 --> 00:49:49.105]  off against each other.
[00:49:49.145 --> 00:49:49.445]  Here it is.
[00:49:58.926 --> 00:50:03.709]  Except for the occasional one such as we have here, who lets the other two fight.
[00:50:03.729 --> 00:50:07.271]  And he waits.
[00:50:12.814 --> 00:50:17.217]  Waits until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself.
[00:50:18.577 --> 00:50:21.719]  And then, like Spectre, he strikes.
[00:50:23.926 --> 00:50:25.649]  I find the parallel amusing.
[00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:31.940]  Our organization did not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement, number three.
[00:50:35.326 --> 00:50:36.348]  Come in, Kronstein.
[00:50:37.111 --> 00:50:41.553]  Sit down, number three, while we listen to what number five has devised for us.
[00:50:41.853 --> 00:50:45.854]  I hope Cranston's efforts as director of planning will continue to be a success.
[00:50:45.994 --> 00:50:51.436]  All right, folks, and when you watch the White House czars on C-SPAN, they sit there and talk like that.
[00:50:52.076 --> 00:50:53.397]  We must brainwash the public.
[00:50:53.897 --> 00:50:54.997]  Now is the answer.
[00:50:55.237 --> 00:50:57.838]  We move forward with re-education in the schools.
[00:50:58.478 --> 00:51:00.219]  Our program is complete.
[00:51:00.519 --> 00:51:02.660]  We now will tell them the children belong to the state.
[00:51:03.421 --> 00:51:05.587]  Abortion and inoculation compulsory!
[00:51:05.607 --> 00:51:08.436]  I mean, we're now to the point of them openly doing this.
[00:51:09.957 --> 00:51:10.838]  Clean water at home.
[00:51:11.138 --> 00:51:12.238]  Clean water at the office.
[00:51:12.559 --> 00:51:13.599]  Clean water on the go.
[00:51:13.879 --> 00:51:19.803]  The Berkey Guy has a Berkey water filtration model for anywhere you are and one that fits any budget.

[00:51:39.554 --> 00:51:45.737]  Uncover a simple privacy loophole that can stop the NSA spying thugs in their tracks at PrivacyLockdown.com.
[00:51:45.897 --> 00:51:51.479]  The NSA has already shut down hundreds of sites, and to truth be told, they could shut down this operation at any time.
[00:51:51.759 --> 00:51:57.882]  See, the privacy loophole I'm about to show you allows you to make all your sensitive information disappear in the next 30 days or less.

[00:52:06.966 --> 00:52:08.187]  Go to PrivacyLockdown.com.
[00:52:09.247 --> 00:52:10.708]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:52:10.988 --> 00:52:14.090]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:15.451]  A pair of scissors.
[00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:20.655]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making an easy for him.
[00:52:20.835 --> 00:52:25.178]  Almost every home security system, even though sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:52:25.498 --> 00:52:26.359]  The phone line.
[00:52:26.519 --> 00:52:31.862]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:35.745]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:52:35.965 --> 00:52:38.927]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:52:39.527 --> 00:52:41.990]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:46.314]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[00:52:46.615 --> 00:52:47.656]  Scissors can't cut it.

[00:53:08.833 --> 00:53:09.294]  Hi, folks.
[00:53:09.374 --> 00:53:11.415]  Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:53:11.675 --> 00:53:16.558]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:53:16.799 --> 00:53:24.644]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:53:24.904 --> 00:53:29.227]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:53:29.448 --> 00:53:33.271]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:53:33.411 --> 00:53:39.115]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:53:39.355 --> 00:53:42.138]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:53:42.518 --> 00:53:47.682]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:54:31.693 --> 00:54:34.575]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[00:54:35.056 --> 00:54:36.096]  It lasts 25 years.
[00:54:36.316 --> 00:54:38.318]  It's great to have that security and not be dependent.
[00:54:39.098 --> 00:54:43.161]  And they have got a bunch of specials at MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[00:54:43.621 --> 00:54:44.862]  They have great customer service 866-229-0927.
[00:54:44.922 --> 00:54:46.623]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[00:54:50.666 --> 00:54:56.268]  And please don't forget we have the new magazine for March in, in bulk, with John Wayne on the cover.
[00:54:56.868 --> 00:54:58.669]  And it says, The War on Men.
[00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:09.593]  And it's all about the chemicals, the biologicals, the food, the water, how they're targeting men, simple diet things and precautions men can take and women can take, by the way.
[00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:13.114]  It over-feminizes women and causes them to get breast cancer, you name it.
[00:55:13.574 --> 00:55:15.575]  We're going to talk more about this coming up in the next hour.
[00:55:15.595 --> 00:55:18.896]  Also, how they're going to try to list all normal activity as mentally ill.
[00:55:19.756 --> 00:55:21.558]  Fatherhood of your son admires you.
[00:55:21.898 --> 00:55:23.219]  That's now listed as mentally ill.
[00:55:23.239 --> 00:55:25.080]  You can only admire the state.
[00:55:25.201 --> 00:55:26.462]  I mean, this is some sick stuff.
[00:55:26.922 --> 00:55:32.767]  You can buy the magazine in bulk in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost to wake up friends and family.
[00:55:32.807 --> 00:55:35.049]  So you basically get like 10 of them for the cost of
[00:55:36.277 --> 00:55:37.959]  Two regular magazines or even less.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.242]  Big color, glossy magazine.
[00:55:40.483 --> 00:55:43.447]  This is a black and white cover, so that's not color this time.
[00:55:43.867 --> 00:55:45.329]  But the magazine inside is color.
[00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:50.977]  And it's good to have print when print's going out, because people really pay attention to it now.
[00:55:51.898 --> 00:55:53.881]  So again, I want to invite everyone.
[00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:57.443]  To go to Infowarsstore.com and get the magazine.
[00:55:57.863 --> 00:56:08.171]  To check out Infowarslife.com where we have the super metal vitality proprietary system that you've heard the rave reviews of to block the estrogen mimickers and help you release your normal hormones.
[00:56:08.791 --> 00:56:13.955]  We've got the fluoride shield that takes out the fluoride and a bunch of other heavy metals and toxins.
[00:56:14.336 --> 00:56:17.058]  It's the nascent iodine and five other key compounds that chelate.
[00:56:17.618 --> 00:56:20.941]  And we've got the best-selling proprietary nascent iodine
[00:56:21.661 --> 00:56:25.845]  The Survival Shield, all available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:56:26.165 --> 00:56:31.050]  Or if you have any questions or would like to order via the phone, it's 888-253-3139.

[00:56:46.448 --> 00:56:53.451]  Now, coming up in the next hour, Dr. Gribb's going to be with us, and I'm going to get into mind control with him, because I asked him what he wanted to talk about.
[00:56:54.011 --> 00:56:54.972]  I had some of my own topics.
[00:56:55.012 --> 00:56:59.914]  The first thing he wants to talk about, he gave me a list of some of the things he wants to talk about.
[00:57:00.234 --> 00:57:08.617]  The current DSM is 943 pages long and lists 374 mental disorders, including not liking tyranny.
[00:57:09.678 --> 00:57:13.039]  So, if he's got a copy of this, can I have a copy of this?
[00:57:13.059 --> 00:57:14.440]  Will you get them to print me a copy of that?
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:14.700]  Thanks.
[00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:17.150]  Okay, I was in the back of my binder.
[00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.550]  Thank you.
[00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:20.473]  So, all of that is coming up.
[00:57:21.274 --> 00:57:23.295]  By the way, we're seeing the destruction of Bitcoin.
[00:57:23.416 --> 00:57:24.777]  Hundreds of lawsuits being filed.
[00:57:25.117 --> 00:57:26.678]  Major exchanges going bankrupt.
[00:57:26.999 --> 00:57:29.241]  Bitcoin CEO found dead in Singapore.
[00:57:29.681 --> 00:57:30.902]  Suicide suspected.
[00:57:32.162 --> 00:57:33.983]  Yeah, and all these top bankers dying too.
[00:57:34.764 --> 00:57:37.646]  I mean, that's why I've not touched it with a 10-foot pole.
[00:57:38.207 --> 00:57:39.568]  And I've been proven right again.
[00:57:39.608 --> 00:57:40.929]  That's because why I'm bad.
[00:57:41.389 --> 00:57:43.591]  Alex, why don't you want to get involved in Bitcoin?
[00:57:43.651 --> 00:57:46.993]  I could have gotten involved in it four years ago and made $500 million.
[00:57:48.054 --> 00:57:52.498]  But I don't want to end up being like the Wolf of Wall Street, folks.
[00:57:54.781 --> 00:57:56.543]  I'm not saying cryptocurrencies aren't good.
[00:57:56.563 --> 00:57:57.624]  I'm not saying it's not the future.
[00:57:57.905 --> 00:58:05.094]  The first one to come out is guaranteed to be set up, or guaranteed to be destroyed, and it's a serious situation.
[00:58:05.135 --> 00:58:05.795]  That's coming up.
[00:58:06.496 --> 00:58:08.058]  And look, I've proven right again, okay?
[00:58:09.008 --> 00:58:12.149]  You got all these suckers that are staying in it, got the Bitcoin conference going on right now.
[00:58:12.709 --> 00:58:18.811]  I've had all sorts of people reach out to me and, oh, we could really, you know, make it worthwhile if you get into Bitcoin.
[00:58:19.131 --> 00:58:22.292]  Hey, hell will freeze over before it happens, okay?
[00:58:22.712 --> 00:58:27.414]  Hell will freeze over before I steer people into something I think's not good.
[00:58:27.694 --> 00:58:27.974]  Got it?
[00:58:28.494 --> 00:58:32.095]  I try to steer people into something I only think is great, that I do myself, and that's not perfect.
[00:58:33.263 --> 00:58:36.825]  Even though our track record was, I don't know, getting to Golden's 300 and 1300 right now.
[00:58:36.865 --> 00:58:38.186]  I don't know, pretty good deal, you know.
[00:58:38.666 --> 00:58:39.587]  I just reap what I sow.
[00:58:39.647 --> 00:58:40.247]  Reap what I sow.
[00:58:40.267 --> 00:58:42.128]  I just wanna, I just wanna win, win, win, win, win.
[00:58:42.388 --> 00:58:43.829]  I wanna bless, bless, bless, bless, bless.
[00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:45.570]  I wanna be blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed.
[00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:45.870]  Got it?
[00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:46.410]  Got it?
[00:58:46.631 --> 00:58:47.391]  Get it to win it.
[00:58:47.411 --> 00:58:50.133]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:53.574]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:53.594 --> 00:58:55.616]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.431 --> 00:59:09.778]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:59:10.098 --> 00:59:11.959]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:59:12.159 --> 00:59:12.860]  Fluoride!
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:15.342]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:59:15.482 --> 00:59:21.286]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:59:21.546 --> 00:59:26.349]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:59:26.469 --> 00:59:29.171]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[00:59:29.451 --> 00:59:30.011]  We're good.
[01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:04.436]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.897 --> 01:00:07.799]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.443 --> 01:00:15.083]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.764 --> 01:00:16.784]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.525 --> 01:00:18.646]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:20.087]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:21.748]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.428 --> 01:00:26.051]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.611 --> 01:00:30.714]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.575 --> 01:00:43.237]  Dr. Edward Drips coming up in the next segment and then Ben Swann is scheduled to arrive in the next 45 minutes here at the Infowars Media Center.
[01:00:44.117 --> 01:00:49.558]  Always look forward to having the multiple Edward R. Murrow winning journalist in studio with us.
[01:00:52.419 --> 01:00:55.239]  We ought to get him to model some of the t-shirts or something for the ladies out there.
[01:00:55.259 --> 01:00:58.060]  He looks like a cross between Audie Murphy and
[01:01:00.051 --> 01:01:01.112]  James Dean or something.
[01:01:01.192 --> 01:01:05.455]  So Ben Swan is coming in to the studio.
[01:01:05.515 --> 01:01:11.939]  But what I really like about Ben Swan is he's a patriot and covers really hardcore news stories and fights for my children's future.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.821]  Continuing, we're going to discuss this in the next segment.
[01:01:14.842 --> 01:01:15.622]  I want to just mention it.
[01:01:16.102 --> 01:01:19.325]  Missouri teachers object to being shot during drills.
[01:01:19.925 --> 01:01:20.746]  How dare them?
[01:01:22.213 --> 01:01:32.617]  And so in the next segment, I'm going to break some of this down, but Kurt Nemo's article that's linked on DrudgeReport.com in the middle column under Ted Cruz calling for the IRS to be abolished.
[01:01:33.377 --> 01:01:33.917]  Man, that's hot.
[01:01:33.937 --> 01:01:34.577]  I like that guy.
[01:01:35.298 --> 01:01:40.980]  We're going to be going over the fact that this is basically mass mind control, and I'm going to be explaining how that works.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:46.762]  Also, Google Glass app knows what emotion you're feeling.
[01:01:48.151 --> 01:01:49.252]  Yes, this is mind control.
[01:01:49.792 --> 01:02:04.883]  And that's why Amazon, with 100% accuracy, can predict what you're going to be ordering before you order it, how your mouse goes over it, what you do, tracking you in real time with AI computers.
[01:02:04.903 --> 01:02:07.044]  They're basically already AI when it comes to reading humans.
[01:02:07.084 --> 01:02:13.669]  I wouldn't say they're completely independent, but they are when it comes to tracking humans, artificially intelligent all the way.
[01:02:14.562 --> 01:02:17.424]  And becoming self-aware to a certain extent of what you're doing.
[01:02:17.764 --> 01:02:21.987]  By interfacing with humans, they become more human than human as humans merge with it.
[01:02:22.888 --> 01:02:27.911]  More human than human, that's our goal here at Tyrell Corporation, as he tells Roy Batty.
[01:02:29.432 --> 01:02:32.514]  So, we're going to be looking at all of that coming up.
[01:02:33.415 --> 01:02:37.017]  There's some good news on the Obamacare front.
[01:02:37.097 --> 01:02:43.842]  Bill to make the fine zero dollars for violating the individual mandate passes by 90 votes in the House, but guess what?
[01:02:44.562 --> 01:02:51.065]  The total hardcore criminals of the Democratic Party, with the Republican kleptocrats aiding them in the Senate, are going to block it.
[01:02:51.746 --> 01:02:55.928]  That's why we need the Tea Party to take over, because it'll be, bye-bye Obamacare!
[01:02:56.768 --> 01:03:00.170]  The globalists are so arrogant, they think that they can do things like this to us.
[01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:06.013]  They are so arrogant, that they think they can get away with things of this magnitude.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:14.481]  And it is simply totally outrageous that we have now been brought to this point where they can get away with stuff like this.
[01:03:14.501 --> 01:03:18.582]  Because if they get away with this, you know what I say, the sky is not the limit.
[01:03:19.242 --> 01:03:20.503]  Infinity is not the limit.
[01:03:21.263 --> 01:03:24.403]  Infinity and beyond, as Buzz Lightyear likes to say.
[01:03:24.863 --> 01:03:26.044]  Here's another one out of Variety.
[01:03:26.944 --> 01:03:29.984]  Hollywood continues to flee California at alarming rate.
[01:03:30.044 --> 01:03:31.044]  Let me explain what's happening.
[01:03:31.645 --> 01:03:33.465]  Hollywood is dead.
[01:03:34.779 --> 01:03:38.941]  And the final nail in the coffin is House of Cards, as I said yesterday.
[01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:43.024]  It's downloaded 16 million times a week in China alone.
[01:03:43.584 --> 01:03:48.767]  Some estimates are 100 million if you count pirates of it, as if pirates matter.
[01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:52.389]  That's the end of these people.
[01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:53.269]  I mean, that's what I told you.
[01:03:53.289 --> 01:04:01.554]  If I could produce Loose Change, seen 100 plus million times online for free, and then other films seen 40, 50 million times apiece,
[01:04:03.201 --> 01:04:04.542]  How do they respond to that?
[01:04:05.303 --> 01:04:08.225]  And I'm not here tooting my horn, I'm just showing you the success I've had.
[01:04:08.985 --> 01:04:10.567]  I mean, you build it, they will come.
[01:04:11.527 --> 01:04:12.908]  You build it, they will come.
[01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:15.110]  You build it, they will come.
[01:04:16.567 --> 01:04:17.748]  You build it, they will come.
[01:04:18.908 --> 01:04:35.259]  Once you have a real tree market of ideas, they built the internet to predict the future, control the future, track everything we do, but what happens if the human spirit becomes the ghost in the machine and we fully hack the system by our actions, by our voting with our dollars, by free association, it's game over.
[01:04:35.579 --> 01:04:37.260]  The minute you realize the power you have.
[01:04:38.322 --> 01:04:40.183]  And of course they're exiting California.
[01:04:40.304 --> 01:04:43.966]  The problem is, locusts always eat a field and fly on to the next field.
[01:04:44.607 --> 01:04:45.868]  It's not necessarily a good thing.
[01:04:46.448 --> 01:04:50.171]  Californians, a lot of good ones, a lot of good Californians, but you know, the socialist type.
[01:04:50.632 --> 01:04:52.333]  They come to Austin, they want the guns banned.
[01:04:53.054 --> 01:04:54.875]  They come up and tell you you shouldn't have kids in the store.
[01:04:55.636 --> 01:04:56.076]  They rule!
[01:04:57.017 --> 01:04:58.097]  With invincible ignorance.
[01:04:59.158 --> 01:05:00.860]  And they call for gun owners to be put in FEMA camps.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.640]  We've done the man on the street.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:07.205]  I mean, they are a cult of demonic, authoritarian scumbags who will destroy everything if they have a chance.
[01:05:09.611 --> 01:05:11.252]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:05:11.512 --> 01:05:15.014]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:05:15.154 --> 01:05:19.577]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:05:19.717 --> 01:05:25.681]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:05:25.801 --> 01:05:36.587]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:43.092]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:05:43.292 --> 01:06:00.285]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:06:00.606 --> 01:06:04.709]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filter today at Infowarstore.com.
[01:06:07.669 --> 01:06:10.390]  The facts are in.
[01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:11.710]  The studies are legion.
[01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:19.292]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:06:19.492 --> 01:06:22.932]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:23.712]  Simple.
[01:06:23.873 --> 01:06:28.313]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:06:28.593 --> 01:06:31.814]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[01:06:32.014 --> 01:06:34.055]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:06:34.316 --> 01:06:39.679]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:50.367]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:06:50.647 --> 01:06:54.890]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.071]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:06:57.392 --> 01:07:00.594]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations

[01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:09.176]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:09.416 --> 01:07:15.017]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:22.438]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:07:22.598 --> 01:07:25.779]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:07:25.939 --> 01:07:27.740]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:32.541]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:07:32.621 --> 01:07:35.382]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:07:35.542 --> 01:07:41.323]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:07:41.504 --> 01:07:44.965]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:07:45.185 --> 01:07:50.226]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[01:07:50.426 --> 01:07:53.407]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:53.647 --> 01:07:59.515]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:07:59.635 --> 01:08:01.638]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[01:08:01.798 --> 01:08:07.225]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:07.305 --> 01:08:08.687]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:23.943 --> 01:08:29.948]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:30.688 --> 01:08:32.330]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.803 --> 01:08:43.886]  All right, we have got a lot of really big breaking news.
[01:08:43.906 --> 01:08:48.630]  The Ukrainian situation is escalating with Obama giving a statement right now.
[01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:49.750]  We'll be breaking that down.
[01:08:50.391 --> 01:08:53.333]  McCain says, oh, we just cut the defense budget and the Russians invade.
[01:08:53.714 --> 01:08:55.895]  Yeah, because the West has started the war over there.
[01:08:56.456 --> 01:08:58.237]  We've got that situation going on.
[01:08:59.338 --> 01:08:59.819]  We've got
[01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:11.536]  Chris Christie, the open borders anti-gun, self-propelled, job-of-the-hut look-alike, getting a standing ovation at CPAC, showing you how many problems there are in the Republican Party.
[01:09:12.096 --> 01:09:19.799]  That they would give basically Hillary Clinton in a Zeppelin's body, I'm not bashing fat people, it's just true, it's the only way to describe it.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:29.422]  That they would give that guy a standing ovation just shows how many neocons and how many establishment sycophants there are.
[01:09:29.922 --> 01:09:33.503]  There's a battle going on at CPAC right now over the heart and soul of it.
[01:09:33.543 --> 01:09:38.525]  Will Libertarian Tea Party be able to take it over and save the country or are we doomed?
[01:09:38.985 --> 01:09:42.926]  Because it is the Republican House, 90 plus votes on top of what they needed.
[01:09:43.886 --> 01:09:45.547]  So that's, gosh, that's like 300 votes to repeal
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:55.349]  The $5,000 fine mandate via the IRS, which the IRS admitted last week, will be taken out of your bank account.
[01:09:56.570 --> 01:10:00.553]  So you will, with penalties and interest, have your bank account taken and things garnished.
[01:10:01.273 --> 01:10:04.515]  And Ted Cruz is saying, abolish the IRS, abolish Obamacare.
[01:10:04.896 --> 01:10:06.777]  And the media is like, how radical!
[01:10:06.797 --> 01:10:08.418]  80 plus percent are against it!
[01:10:08.678 --> 01:10:10.439]  It's a giant criminal screwjob!
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:14.082]  Why on earth would he dare say get rid of it?
[01:10:14.802 --> 01:10:20.006]  It's like if somebody's leg was chopped off, spring blood everywhere, and Dr. Cruz said, put a tourniquet on that!
[01:10:20.026 --> 01:10:21.827]  They're like, how ridiculous!
[01:10:22.287 --> 01:10:23.728]  So that's just some of the news there.
[01:10:24.068 --> 01:10:25.990]  Here's a Weekly Standard article out right now.
[01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:33.874]  Bill to make the fine $0 for violating the individual mandate passes by 90 votes.
[01:10:33.914 --> 01:10:34.534]  Very interesting.
[01:10:35.015 --> 01:10:36.095]  And then here's a new article.
[01:10:36.475 --> 01:10:42.959]  Obama promises illegals Obamacare signup info won't be used for deportation.
[01:10:43.579 --> 01:10:50.203]  And it goes through a video that we're going to play later if we have time, but it's up on InfoWars.com, where he comes out.
[01:10:51.249 --> 01:10:52.690]  And admits they're going to get free health care.
[01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.212]  Of course, that's in there, and it was always in there.
[01:10:55.452 --> 01:11:06.160]  But I wanted to show you the articles out of Politics, I wanted to show you out of The Atlantic, and others, where they said, it's not true.
[01:11:06.861 --> 01:11:10.804]  No, Obamacare does not cover millions of illegal immigrants.
[01:11:11.084 --> 01:11:13.966]  And you can keep your doctor, and Obama's not coming after your guns.
[01:11:15.049 --> 01:11:21.196]  And Bill Clinton did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky, and on and on and on.
[01:11:21.216 --> 01:11:22.958]  And if you built that business, you didn't build it.
[01:11:23.318 --> 01:11:27.322]  And no, tyranny's never just right around the corner and other greatest tits.
[01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:33.889]  Obamacare bars illegal immigrants from getting coverage.
[01:11:33.929 --> 01:11:34.430]  The Atlantic.
[01:11:36.969 --> 01:11:40.672]  It goes on and on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:41.112 --> 01:11:47.818]  Meanwhile, the first snapping turtle, I mean first lady, to Obamacare counselors.
[01:11:47.938 --> 01:11:49.980]  You are doing God's work.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:12:01.849]  This is the acorn-style groups that have gone on record cost stealing millions in cities like New York, that go around your social security number and everything else, to be put into the database with Facebook and other Democratic Party operatives.
[01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.271]  So snapping turtle,
[01:12:04.251 --> 01:12:08.092]  Uh, can, uh, totally screw you for the offshore banks that own the insurance companies.
[01:12:08.132 --> 01:12:08.692]  So, there you go.
[01:12:11.533 --> 01:12:16.214]  Continuing, Obamacare Architect came out and said, you don't need a doctor for every part of your health care.
[01:12:16.454 --> 01:12:16.975]  There you go.
[01:12:17.395 --> 01:12:24.297]  You go to Walmart, like Jacari did, and they have a literal kiosk robot that told him he was obese, even though Jacari has 3% body fat.
[01:12:25.597 --> 01:12:27.077]  I mean, folks have seen Jacari Jackson.
[01:12:27.117 --> 01:12:30.678]  I mean, this is, this is insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:31.358 --> 01:12:32.939]  Uh, continuing, uh, here.
[01:12:34.491 --> 01:12:38.292]  Feds are given two-year grace period for non-Obamacare plans.
[01:12:39.493 --> 01:12:48.176]  Another nightmare, 160,000 pages of new regulations for doctors inside the Obamacare plan.
[01:12:48.616 --> 01:12:57.059]  Hospital records used to target ads on Twitter and Facebook, say privacy campaigners, in National Health Service data concerns.
[01:12:57.519 --> 01:12:58.980]  And in Obamacare, just like in England,
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.783]  They use all your data and your health care records are no longer secret from hundreds of corporations and groups and government.
[01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:07.943]  Nixon almost got impeached.
[01:13:07.963 --> 01:13:09.624]  Well, he got impeached in the House.
[01:13:09.904 --> 01:13:11.725]  Didn't get convicted because he stepped down in the Senate.
[01:13:11.925 --> 01:13:18.368]  You get indicted in the House and tried in the Senate for having a hundred and something names in a safe with people's income tax records.
[01:13:18.748 --> 01:13:20.829]  Now it's just throw it all around, just use it.
[01:13:21.069 --> 01:13:24.330]  Not supposed to use a social security number by federal law other than the program.
[01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:26.251]  Everybody asked for it in violation of law.
[01:13:26.571 --> 01:13:28.432]  They do what they want.
[01:13:31.718 --> 01:13:36.562]  Now, I want to get to one more article and segue into Dr. Group to talk about both the things we just discussed.
[01:13:36.602 --> 01:13:42.047]  I appreciate him coming up from South Texas to come on the broadcast with us, and he's here in studio.
[01:13:42.468 --> 01:13:48.313]  But I wanted to get to this top story that is up on Infowars.com.
[01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:57.713]  PrisonPlanet.com, and the easiest place to find it is in the middle column of DrudgeReport.com, right under Ted Cruz.
[01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:02.774]  And think of the radicalness of these teachers, how dare them!
[01:14:03.294 --> 01:14:12.297]  They don't want to be under mandated law, made to be part of drills where they throw fake blood on them and run around shooting them with paintballs and screaming.
[01:14:13.237 --> 01:14:17.819]  And in the article it's admitted, it's federal funding, that the homeschool legal defense team, played by the police,
[01:14:19.268 --> 01:14:25.812]  uh... comes the pro-homeschool, anti-public school groups, what it's called, comes to kill everyone at the school.
[01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:28.194]  They'll even blow up a bus outside to scare the kids.
[01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:29.335]  You've seen this in the news many times.
[01:14:30.492 --> 01:14:31.772]  This is high-tech mind control.
[01:14:32.112 --> 01:14:33.573]  This is what a re-education camp is.
[01:14:33.853 --> 01:14:38.214]  This is to create the perception there's all these mass shootings, to then demonize guns and self-defense.
[01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:47.176]  When 165 people died in 2013 from mass shootings total, more than 90 of those were gang members shooting each other.
[01:14:47.797 --> 01:14:49.277]  And I'm not saying that's okay, it's just a fact.
[01:14:49.737 --> 01:14:51.277]  You have a better chance of a honeybee.
[01:14:51.698 --> 01:14:54.978]  Even Esquire did an article on this in the same issue I was in last year.
[01:14:55.539 --> 01:14:56.439]  A honeybee kills 200 plus.
[01:14:58.575 --> 01:14:58.775]  Okay?
[01:14:59.355 --> 01:15:03.138]  But they create the perception that this is all mind control on record.
[01:15:03.338 --> 01:15:04.338]  They admit that's why they do it.
[01:15:04.358 --> 01:15:06.319]  It's not to get cops ready for a mass shooting.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:13.143]  It's to get cops ready to, you know, provide the emergency shots so kids don't die of honeybee stings on the playground.
[01:15:14.104 --> 01:15:18.186]  You know, I guess they ought to have TSA checkpoints for honeybees and, you know, lockdowns.
[01:15:18.266 --> 01:15:19.087]  A honeybee was seen.
[01:15:19.787 --> 01:15:21.468]  Cars kill hundreds of thousands, folks.
[01:15:22.869 --> 01:15:26.571]  Missouri teachers object to being shot during drills.
[01:15:27.878 --> 01:15:33.727]  Missouri students and teachers are required by law to participate in active shooter drills.
[01:15:34.508 --> 01:15:35.951]  And they say they don't want to be part of it.
[01:15:36.954 --> 01:16:01.331]  And then we go through how they say that it's always right-wingers or gun groups or veterans groups who are the bad guys, and the kids and teachers are told that the Tea Party's coming to murder everyone, and then the Pentagon drills, we've shown you these articles in Forbes, we broke it but Forbes carried it, that they're saying the Tea Party's going to attack police stations and schools, and just last week in Ohio they trained with the National Guard for the pro-gun group to attack the school.
[01:16:02.452 --> 01:16:02.933]  That's right!
[01:16:04.016 --> 01:16:06.177]  Never really happened in reality, but so what?
[01:16:06.697 --> 01:16:09.758]  Because they're really going to blow up federal buildings again and blame it on us.
[01:16:10.019 --> 01:16:11.159]  They're going to false flag us.
[01:16:11.179 --> 01:16:12.219]  You can see the whole script.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:13.920]  You don't have to be smart to know this.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:20.383]  Democratic parties have been caught in five different memos the last four years saying, we need big terror attacks to blame the Tea Party.
[01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:21.603]  Obama needs it.
[01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:25.445]  It's a Bible page width from just admitting it openly.
[01:16:26.085 --> 01:16:27.606]  They're like, man, this would sure help us.
[01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:33.774]  And folks, if you study Soviet re-education camps, they would turn whole towns into tattletale snitch things.
[01:16:33.814 --> 01:16:35.295]  They would have these drills.
[01:16:35.875 --> 01:16:37.396]  This is what it's all about.
[01:16:38.056 --> 01:16:39.177]  And it's outrageous.
[01:16:39.277 --> 01:16:41.378]  And it shouldn't be going on in your school.
[01:16:41.438 --> 01:16:53.563]  We've had lawyers on from Oregon, from Minnesota and Texas who won lawsuits with their clients where they don't tell the kids and come into the fifth graders class and say, I'm going to kill you.
[01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:55.544]  And the kids literally crap all over themselves.
[01:16:56.328 --> 01:17:00.171]  They've done it with teachers and put them in the woods, not telling them it was a drill, and they're totally screwed up.
[01:17:00.371 --> 01:17:03.974]  They have government-run camps where they come at night and say they're going to kill them.
[01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:08.697]  And this is all part of the government traumatizing them, and then they're the savior.
[01:17:09.338 --> 01:17:10.879]  It's Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:17:11.219 --> 01:17:13.320]  They are inducing mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:17:13.681 --> 01:17:16.022]  Now, Dr. Ed Group joins us.
[01:17:16.483 --> 01:17:18.584]  Great patriot, former Army Special Forces.
[01:17:18.604 --> 01:17:20.125]  He doesn't like me saying that, but he's interesting.
[01:17:20.145 --> 01:17:21.767]  He's such a nice guy and one of the top
[01:17:22.287 --> 01:17:23.747]  Product developers in the country.
[01:17:23.787 --> 01:17:24.388]  We're so blessed.
[01:17:24.408 --> 01:17:26.108]  He's developed three products for us.
[01:17:26.148 --> 01:17:28.129]  That's not why he's overall here today.
[01:17:28.169 --> 01:17:34.190]  Then we fund ourselves with Super Metal Vitality, Survival Shield, Fluoride Shield, and the rest of it at Infowarslife.com.
[01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:44.333]  We're going to break in a few minutes, but I'm going to give you the floor when we come back because you want to get into the psychological warfare takeover today and the current DSM that lists not trusting the government as a mental illness.
[01:17:45.373 --> 01:17:46.874]  I mean, this is literally the Soviet Union.
[01:17:47.474 --> 01:17:50.835]  But what do you make of what they're doing with these active shooter drills?
[01:17:52.622 --> 01:17:54.104]  Well, exactly what you're talking about.
[01:17:54.144 --> 01:17:56.327]  I mean, they're just trying to instill fear into the public.
[01:17:56.347 --> 01:17:58.430]  They're trying to manipulate the public.
[01:17:58.450 --> 01:18:00.012]  They're trying to control the public.
[01:18:00.172 --> 01:18:05.780]  And it's exactly what I wanted to talk about today, because if you look back at the history, there is an agenda going on.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.101]  I mean, we talk about it a lot.
[01:18:07.762 --> 01:18:19.369]  And one thing that we haven't got into detail about is the agenda to create mental illness through fear tactics and everything else to classify everybody as having a mental disorder.
[01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:24.953]  And there's a complete agenda that's been put into place since the late 1800s that's continuing today.
[01:18:25.513 --> 01:18:31.077]  And that's something that everybody needs to know about the psychotropic drugs that are being used.
[01:18:31.557 --> 01:18:37.839]  Which are mind-altering drugs, anything from antidepressants to the stimulants, the Adderall, all this other stuff.
[01:18:37.859 --> 01:18:38.860]  And they won't tell you St.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:42.381]  John's Wort in double-blind studies has been proven to be better than psychotropics.
[01:18:42.621 --> 01:18:46.502]  They won't tell you you can get natural plant-derived lithium that'll settle anybody down.
[01:18:46.542 --> 01:18:48.563]  They just don't tell you all the natural stuff's in there.
[01:18:48.723 --> 01:19:03.894]  No, by design, they want every single person classified as a mental illness, and that's why the DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual that psychiatry has created, there's no history of any scientific studies that can actually verify a mental illness.
[01:19:04.435 --> 01:19:08.477]  Like a cancer cell, you can look at it under a microscope and say, that's a cancer cell.
[01:19:08.538 --> 01:19:11.560]  Okay, if I put this substance in there, I can see it killing the cancer cell.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:19.892]  But there's no statistical evidence or any scientific evidence that can justify any mental illness that people are suffering from today.
[01:19:19.952 --> 01:19:20.633]  It's voodoo!
[01:19:20.713 --> 01:19:26.902]  Most people, it turns out, correct me if I'm wrong, who end up having classical schizophrenia, they don't tell them it's heavy metal toxicity.
[01:19:27.523 --> 01:19:40.711]  Right, the thing is they classify mental illness as a chemical imbalance and that was started in the 1930s when a scientist came out and said he theorized that all mental illness was a chemical imbalance in the brain.
[01:19:40.751 --> 01:19:50.598]  Of course there's no proof of that but psychiatry has used that and the big pharmaceutical companies have used the chemical imbalance statement to produce and
[01:19:51.178 --> 01:19:58.580]  To create diseases like loneliness now, like nail biting, all these mental illnesses that they can drug people for.
[01:19:58.941 --> 01:20:00.161]  Well sure, to expand their business.
[01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:04.422]  But in truth, there is chemical imbalance because of what they're putting food in the water.
[01:20:04.923 --> 01:20:07.483]  Then they come in with another chemical to mask that.
[01:20:07.523 --> 01:20:08.764]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:20:09.639 --> 01:20:13.740]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.321]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored.
[01:20:16.461 --> 01:20:21.122]  And more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.

[01:23:39.096 --> 01:23:40.117]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:23:40.197 --> 01:23:44.539]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:23:44.699 --> 01:23:50.321]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:53.763]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:23:53.983 --> 01:23:56.824]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:58.765 --> 01:24:01.467]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:24:20.527 --> 01:24:22.810]  Well, Obama just signed an executive order.
[01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:23.791]  We're getting a copy of it.
[01:24:24.031 --> 01:24:25.953]  Visa restrictions, economic sanctions.
[01:24:26.533 --> 01:24:27.595]  In short, new Cold War.
[01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:34.261]  Oh boy, I tell ya, they need a new big defense budget, and they're doing the big show.
[01:24:35.121 --> 01:24:39.342]  So there you go, the Al Qaeda's now their buddy, the Tea Party and the Russians are the new enemy.
[01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:48.245]  Domestically, and speaking of drugging the population, mom who drove kids into the ocean, another victim of anti-depressants.
[01:24:48.305 --> 01:24:52.246]  Turns out she was on them, turned out Adam Lanza was on them.
[01:24:52.366 --> 01:24:57.248]  99% of the time, literally, I've talked to cops, they pull up and some woman's chopped their baby up, they go look in the
[01:24:58.553 --> 01:25:02.280]  In the medicine cabinet, and there's the serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[01:25:03.782 --> 01:25:05.285]  Just absolutely amazing.
[01:25:05.305 --> 01:25:06.607]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:25:06.848 --> 01:25:08.912]  That's exactly what you were just talking about, Dr. Group.
[01:25:10.454 --> 01:25:25.182]  It's becoming such a huge problem all over the world that the antidepressants and the stimulants are becoming so heavy in the water supply now that even if you're not on antidepressants and you drink the water over in Europe, a gallon of water equals the equivalent of one Prozac.
[01:25:25.702 --> 01:25:37.389]  I mean, the problem that we're dealing with right now is this was all done by design to dumb down the population, to addict the population, and no mental illness was ever scientifically proven.
[01:25:37.409 --> 01:25:39.250]  If you trace it back, psychiatry
[01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:43.653]  Psychiatrists, first of all, weren't even really doctors a long time ago.
[01:25:43.693 --> 01:25:46.034]  They were just caretakers of the mentally ill.
[01:25:46.775 --> 01:26:04.027]  Over a period of time, they started creating all these mental illnesses, supposedly, so they could team up with the pharmaceutical companies and create the first diagnostic and statistical manual which actually outlines mental illnesses and then create drugs to be able to put people on.
[01:26:04.147 --> 01:26:07.790]  And I've got to interrupt you because they read my mind and I was going to interrupt and I controlled myself and didn't.
[01:26:08.610 --> 01:26:13.714]  Fish are becoming killers, ABC News, minnows because of it, just like the kids.
[01:26:14.475 --> 01:26:18.198]  And the fish are also committing suicide, swimming right up to birds, so are shrimp.
[01:26:19.099 --> 01:26:21.741]  You put women on these drugs, it makes them nymphomaniacs.
[01:26:22.261 --> 01:26:23.662]  It takes away the inhibition.
[01:26:24.103 --> 01:26:27.285]  It's absolutely, and it hurts your brain, it hurts your heart.
[01:26:27.345 --> 01:26:27.666]  Go ahead.
[01:26:28.226 --> 01:26:33.553]  All of the shooters that have shot people, they're all on some sort of antidepressants.
[01:26:33.733 --> 01:26:35.295]  The insert says it!
[01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:36.356]  The insert says it!
[01:26:36.536 --> 01:26:37.077]  Absolutely.
[01:26:37.177 --> 01:26:37.658]  Suicide.
[01:26:37.698 --> 01:26:38.679]  I mean, look at the military.
[01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:46.432]  716 people out of every 100,000 on antidepressants are committing suicide.
[01:26:46.452 --> 01:26:52.714]  There's more soldiers in the military committing suicide than dying of actual war itself.
[01:26:53.294 --> 01:27:07.278]  These children all over the nation that are committing suicide, even as young as five years old, the children that are in state custody foster care programs, over 90% of them are on antipsychotic drugs and usually that's not
[01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:15.220]  You know, they're being screened, and if you could, you can screen, there's no testing to determine if somebody should be on these medications.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:20.442]  It's not like you can take a blood test, a hair test, a urine test, and say, okay, you have a chemical imbalance.
[01:27:20.462 --> 01:27:22.963]  And they're in the psychotropic hallucinogen family.
[01:27:23.413 --> 01:27:30.516]  Yes, I mean a psychotropic drug would be an antidepressant or a stimulant or anything that's psychotropic is just mind altering.
[01:27:30.576 --> 01:27:32.316]  So basically they're altering your mind.
[01:27:32.356 --> 01:27:35.798]  Now here's how this factors into the whole Obamacare and everything else.
[01:27:36.498 --> 01:27:38.459]  If you're classified as
[01:27:39.079 --> 01:27:39.299]  I don't
[01:27:59.945 --> 01:28:06.569]  You know, reason why they want to push this on people and push it on kids is so that everybody is labeled with mental illness.
[01:28:06.969 --> 01:28:13.233]  Now, by the time a child is 18, they've gone through at least 12 mental illness screens in school.
[01:28:13.273 --> 01:28:19.297]  They have what's called a teen screen going on right now all across the nation, where... And they ask, are you anxious at age 11?
[01:28:19.357 --> 01:28:19.717]  Yes.
[01:28:19.937 --> 01:28:21.598]  Do you ever have anxiety?
[01:28:21.698 --> 01:28:22.499]  Do you ever cry?
[01:28:22.819 --> 01:28:25.901]  Well, you need to be on Psychotropics, which is part of the New Freedom Initiative.
[01:28:26.181 --> 01:28:28.162]  The goal is to put half the kids on the drugs.
[01:28:28.661 --> 01:28:32.222]  Nine out of ten kids are prescribed a drug after a teen screen right now.
[01:28:32.543 --> 01:28:36.724]  Eighty-four percent of the kids that took the test were also falsely labeled as depressed.
[01:28:37.044 --> 01:28:39.265]  How is that going to affect them later on in life?
[01:28:39.325 --> 01:28:42.266]  I mean, when you got all these kids and it's not... This is how they get rid of their rights.
[01:28:42.286 --> 01:28:43.167]  It's the new slavery.
[01:28:43.387 --> 01:28:52.490]  Well, right, because, you know, people are easily controllable whenever they're... Not only that, like what you said, they're not addressing the root cause of the problem.
[01:28:52.530 --> 01:28:53.691]  Those numbers are incredible.
[01:28:53.911 --> 01:28:55.072]  These numbers are incredible.
[01:28:55.112 --> 01:28:58.374]  I've got 100 million people worldwide on drugs, right?
[01:28:58.474 --> 01:29:00.115]  On psychiatric drugs.
[01:29:00.496 --> 01:29:04.539]  70% of prescribed psychotropic drugs are by general physicians now.
[01:29:04.579 --> 01:29:09.162]  So they've even moved away from the fact that you have to go see a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
[01:29:09.662 --> 01:29:11.183]  You can just go to your doctor.
[01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:14.286]  And what they've done through all the advertising in the media through
[01:29:15.046 --> 01:29:17.187]  You know, are you feeling lonely?
[01:29:17.547 --> 01:29:18.747]  Are you feeling depressed?
[01:29:19.227 --> 01:29:20.908]  Ask your doctor about Zoloft.
[01:29:21.308 --> 01:29:30.970]  So basically, the individual people now they're targeting are going to their doctor saying, doctor, I saw this commercial and I want Zoloft or I want Paxil.
[01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.450]  Exactly.
[01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:34.811]  They don't say you're depressed because you're not getting sunlight, you need to be out.
[01:29:35.111 --> 01:29:36.272]  Go out and play some sports.
[01:29:36.572 --> 01:29:37.832]  Stop watching television.
[01:29:38.132 --> 01:29:39.132]  Start eating healthy.
[01:29:39.733 --> 01:29:41.373]  You're literally killing yourself.
[01:29:41.773 --> 01:29:48.477]  No, the answer is call a doctor and we'll give you a chemical weapon in the hallucinogen class that literally eats your brain cells.
[01:29:49.038 --> 01:29:50.579]  But it'll feel so good.
[01:29:50.959 --> 01:29:52.520]  We'll be right back with Dr. Ed Group.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:55.462]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:29:55.762 --> 01:29:57.623]  More breaking news on Russia straight ahead.
[01:29:58.804 --> 01:29:59.704]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.205 --> 01:30:01.806]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.726 --> 01:30:05.428]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.605 --> 01:30:12.967]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:30:13.048 --> 01:30:15.289]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:30:15.469 --> 01:30:23.775]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:30:24.076 --> 01:30:34.263]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.

[01:33:06.322 --> 01:33:07.363]  We are on the march.
[01:33:07.483 --> 01:33:08.744]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:08.784 --> 01:33:13.068]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:25.051 --> 01:33:26.171]  Ben Swan just arrived.
[01:33:26.191 --> 01:33:30.713]  He's going to be with us in the next hour talking about the future of media, what's happening in Russia, and so much more.
[01:33:31.413 --> 01:33:43.436]  They are announcing, ladies and gentlemen, sanctions right now, both economic and travel on visas, dealing with the situation in Ukraine.
[01:33:44.136 --> 01:33:46.417]  Very serious situation.
[01:33:46.437 --> 01:33:49.418]  Crimea Parliament votes to join Russia.
[01:33:51.707 --> 01:33:57.971]  Here's a new study out, Alzheimer's deaths six times higher than previously thought, and that's in Reuters.
[01:33:58.091 --> 01:34:03.474]  It is exploding because all the heavy metals and the toxins, you were starting to get there, Dr. Group.
[01:34:04.375 --> 01:34:08.578]  We went to break talking about, they're not discussing all the real chemical imbalance.
[01:34:09.358 --> 01:34:20.069]  Prozac-type drugs in the water, estrogen mimickers in the water, in the plastics, in the printer ink, just in everything, and that's why every metric shows we are a diseased population.
[01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:21.591]  Please continue.
[01:34:22.011 --> 01:34:30.320]  Well, yeah, create the disease by poisoning the air, the food, and the water, you know, spraying pesticides, spraying heavy metals everywhere.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:33.002]  You know, that's what causes the real chemical imbalance.
[01:34:33.042 --> 01:34:42.151]  If you get to the root cause of the things, which is what we should be looking at, it's not that you have chemical imbalances and you need antidepressants and you need antipsychotic drugs.
[01:34:42.231 --> 01:34:49.718]  It's clean your life up and avoid drinking the toxic water and the toxic, eating the toxic food and the preservatives and avoid
[01:34:50.399 --> 01:34:51.000]  We're good to go.
[01:35:05.316 --> 01:35:09.779]  Normal human activity is mental illness now to expand their market and their social control.
[01:35:09.799 --> 01:35:13.161]  Just like the Soviet Union used psychiatry and psychology as a tyranny.
[01:35:13.501 --> 01:35:14.782]  I'm not saying everybody in it's bad.
[01:35:14.802 --> 01:35:15.922]  There's a lot of good people in it.
[01:35:16.302 --> 01:35:20.265]  It's just that the main driving force behind it is predatory.
[01:35:20.865 --> 01:35:28.807]  I mean, 50, 60 years ago, they still went around and if your kid was depressed, they'd stick an ice pick into their eye, behind their eye, and give them a lobotomy.
[01:35:28.847 --> 01:35:30.208]  And sure, Junior never complained again.
[01:35:30.228 --> 01:35:31.008]  He never talked again.
[01:35:31.488 --> 01:35:33.809]  So it's just incredibly oppressive what's going on.
[01:35:33.829 --> 01:35:41.391]  And now, under the DSM, they've got all these new disorders where not liking authority, not trusting the system is mentally ill.
[01:35:42.413 --> 01:35:47.657]  374 different mental disorders right now in the DSM and in the 1930s.
[01:35:47.998 --> 01:35:51.581]  When the DSM started it was only 34 mental disorders.
[01:35:52.061 --> 01:35:57.565]  So it's become a huge problem and what's even scarier is the fact that they just came out with a DSM 0-3.
[01:35:59.927 --> 01:36:09.495]  Which means they're, from age 0 to 3, they're diagnosing, I think there's like 12 or 15 mental illnesses between the age of 0 to 3.
[01:36:09.715 --> 01:36:16.961]  And they're teaching moms on the hospital shows and stuff that it's like getting your kid a new suit of clothes or new shoes.
[01:36:17.281 --> 01:36:18.903]  It's fun to get a designation.
[01:36:19.463 --> 01:36:37.394]  It's fun to say something's wrong with your kids and then like Munchausen by proxy, the moms then take them into the system and get them on the drugs or get them in the counseling and then they're now heroes because they've got a special needs child who wasn't special needs but will be once the mental health system is done with them.
[01:36:37.594 --> 01:37:01.543]  Well, first of all, they vaccinate the kid, which is going to cause all kinds of problems in the system, and then they feed them soy formulas and everything else, and they put all these toxins and chemicals in the babies, and then the babies have excessive crying, or, you know, rashes, or showing signs of excessive sleep, or something like that, that they can label as a mental illness and put children on antipsychotics.
[01:37:01.563 --> 01:37:04.504]  Yeah, they get stomach aches when you feed them formula that's 70% sugar.
[01:37:05.984 --> 01:37:13.209]  I mean, when you read a formula deal, the high fructose corn syrup, all of it, and it's like a conspiracy theory that women are supposed to nurse babies.
[01:37:14.269 --> 01:37:15.910]  Right, it is a conspiracy theory.
[01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:23.235]  I mean, the sad news is if you're labeled with a mental illness from the time you're two years old, then that stays with you forever in your entire life.
[01:37:23.515 --> 01:37:25.557]  And it's not like you can get off of these drugs.
[01:37:25.617 --> 01:37:30.080]  It takes a year to wean somebody off an antidepressant or even a stimulant.
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:33.522]  I know somebody that's been on Paxil for 15 years and it's ruined their life.
[01:37:34.142 --> 01:37:37.485]  In their words, to many extent, it's given them a disease where their skin's totally white.
[01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:39.406]  The same disease Michael Jackson had.
[01:37:40.147 --> 01:37:41.848]  They've got an autoimmune issue now.
[01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:43.710]  And the doctors admit it's the Paxil.
[01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:45.231]  Didn't tell them when they went on it.
[01:37:46.472 --> 01:37:47.353]  You say it would take a year.
[01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:48.454]  How would you get them off?
[01:37:49.076 --> 01:37:53.818]  Well, first of all, you know, each individual person has to be evaluated, you know, separately.
[01:37:53.858 --> 01:37:56.299]  Sure, you can't diagnose them, but what would you do on average?
[01:37:56.319 --> 01:38:01.421]  Well, you have to do what's called time-contingent detoxification, which is slowly reduce their dose over a period of a year.
[01:38:01.701 --> 01:38:07.063]  And at the same time, you want to give them natural substances like Tibetan rhodiola or lithium orotate or
[01:38:07.543 --> 01:38:15.032]  You know, something that's going to naturally work with their serotonin receptors in their head, so they have an easy way of getting off.
[01:38:15.072 --> 01:38:19.718]  And at the same time, you're going to be educating that individual on what are the things they need to avoid.
[01:38:20.038 --> 01:38:21.039]  For example, fluoride.
[01:38:21.059 --> 01:38:25.304]  You know, fluoride is going to cause major problems in the brain, in the thyroid gland.
[01:38:25.945 --> 01:38:33.048]  You know, putting them on iodine, you know, detoxifying their body because most people that are on psychotropic drugs are not just on one.
[01:38:33.108 --> 01:38:37.290]  They start with one and then they have problems sleeping or something and then they get put on sleep medications.
[01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:44.133]  Usually they're on six to nine different medications because one thing causes side effects which leads to another thing which leads to another thing.
[01:38:44.153 --> 01:38:46.974]  I saw that the average foster child is on seven drugs.
[01:38:47.654 --> 01:38:49.395]  Seven different psychological drugs.
[01:38:49.415 --> 01:38:49.835]  That's right.
[01:38:50.095 --> 01:38:54.617]  And, you know, suicidal thoughts, aggressiveness, non-motivation.
[01:38:54.737 --> 01:39:06.721]  I mean, looking at society and looking at just trying to find somebody to work these days is so hard to get a good employee because everybody you interview, they're really not motivated to work anymore.
[01:39:06.781 --> 01:39:11.423]  And so this is affecting society as a whole because we don't have
[01:39:11.943 --> 01:39:16.305]  Intelligent people and we don't have people that are working and people are losing their jobs actually.
[01:39:16.665 --> 01:39:22.307]  The auto accidents that are happening, people driving into the water, small children.
[01:39:22.327 --> 01:39:27.669]  I mean there's a whole list of children now that you can pull up online that were, that committed suicide.
[01:39:27.689 --> 01:39:29.750]  These are healthy children, supposedly.
[01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:30.671]  They're seven years old.
[01:39:30.691 --> 01:39:32.231]  They're getting these screens in schools.
[01:39:32.251 --> 01:39:35.613]  They're being, they're sent to their psychiatrist saying they're hyperactive or whatever.
[01:39:35.653 --> 01:39:36.153]  They're put on
[01:39:36.653 --> 01:39:39.057]  You know, they ask them if they're happy in school.
[01:39:39.097 --> 01:39:39.658]  They say no.
[01:39:39.698 --> 01:39:45.486]  They're put on antidepressants and within seven days, the mom finds them hung and they're dead in their closet.
[01:39:45.967 --> 01:39:48.591]  I mean, this is a serious... And the insert says it does it.
[01:39:48.911 --> 01:39:51.114]  And the insert actually says it's done it.
[01:39:52.256 --> 01:40:08.810]  There's not one single case that's ever been documented of depression or ADD or ADHD or any of the 374 mental disorders in the DSM that's been cured, that's documented to be cured after all these years on anti-psychotic drugs.
[01:40:09.071 --> 01:40:09.511]  Not one.
[01:40:10.312 --> 01:40:10.712]  Amazing.
[01:40:10.752 --> 01:40:13.034]  I want to pull up that Time Magazine article from two weeks ago.
[01:40:13.054 --> 01:40:14.535]  I think the headline was
[01:40:16.244 --> 01:40:19.526]  Toxins lowering IQ are brain damaging children in the U.S.
[01:40:20.126 --> 01:40:24.049]  and they admit fluoride's the main one in the water and admit the Harvard study.
[01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:25.569]  Now that's a big deal.
[01:40:25.649 --> 01:40:35.555]  Why would Time Magazine say the biggest thing is fluoride, which we know acts as an adjuvant according to brain surgeons and neurologists like Dr. Blaylock, so it accelerates all the other drugs.
[01:40:35.575 --> 01:40:35.915]  There it is.
[01:40:35.955 --> 01:40:38.917]  Children exposed to more brain-arming chemicals never before.
[01:40:38.957 --> 01:40:39.938]  And the first one they mentioned
[01:40:40.998 --> 01:40:43.220]  And they say causing ADHD is fluoride.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.362]  Well, you gotta remember, all these diseases, these mental illnesses, are created.
[01:40:47.443 --> 01:40:48.403]  And here's how they do it.
[01:40:48.864 --> 01:40:59.331]  Even from the beginning of time, and you can research this online, they got together a group of psychiatrists in a room, a small room, and they presented these symptoms and presented these disorders and they voted on them.
[01:40:59.731 --> 01:41:01.533]  No scientific evidence or anything.
[01:41:01.954 --> 01:41:07.440]  So if you create chemical imbalances in the brain by... What do children eat?
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:17.451]  High fructose corn syrup, excitotoxins, artificial dyes, colors, artificial sweeteners... You can't find chips without MSG excitotoxin.
[01:41:17.691 --> 01:41:19.293]  You can't find them without the...
[01:41:22.230 --> 01:41:22.710]  Aspartame.
[01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:24.051]  I mean, in the gum.
[01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:24.592]  Right.
[01:41:24.672 --> 01:41:28.074]  I mean, look what Blaylock termed the, you know, came up with the term.
[01:41:28.154 --> 01:41:29.214]  Excitotoxins.
[01:41:29.394 --> 01:41:30.835]  Excitotoxins in the brain.
[01:41:30.855 --> 01:41:31.836]  Then add mercury.
[01:41:31.876 --> 01:41:33.477]  That's now a medically accepted fact.
[01:41:33.557 --> 01:41:33.817]  Yes.
[01:41:33.937 --> 01:41:35.418]  Now add aluminum to that.
[01:41:35.578 --> 01:41:42.803]  Add all the heavy metals to that and you literally have a slew going on in your brain and all that's done by design because here's the thing.
[01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:47.646]  The beauty that the medical profession sees in mental illness is
[01:41:48.586 --> 01:41:52.588]  You know, it's not like cancer or any type of disease where you have to do all kinds of testing.
[01:41:52.849 --> 01:42:05.796]  They can prescribe you medications and keep you on medications for the time you're born, pretty much, all the way until you die, just by you coming in and saying, I don't feel good, doctor, with no scientific evidence or anything, and they can put you on these medications.
[01:42:06.156 --> 01:42:11.059]  So it's a $330 billion a year industry.
[01:42:11.079 --> 01:42:13.160]  And just like all drug dealers throughout history,
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:24.032]  They target the school ground, but now they're in the school running the counselors, running the nurses, getting the 10 and 11 year olds that are anxious, you're supposed to be anxious when you're 10 or 11, on drugs.
[01:42:24.093 --> 01:42:26.475]  It's a total criminal takeover.
[01:42:26.495 --> 01:42:30.801]  3,000 deaths a month attributed to psychiatric drugs.
[01:42:31.902 --> 01:42:47.285]  17 million children worldwide have been prescribed psychiatric drugs so dangerous that medicine regulates it in Europe and Australia and have issued warnings that antidepressants can cause suicide and hostility in children and adolescents.
[01:42:47.845 --> 01:42:53.208]  I don't sell it, but people can get it without a prescription, but it's hard to do because it's somewhat doctor controlled.
[01:42:54.048 --> 01:42:58.891]  But people that do have anxiety and things, I was looking up the studies when you told me about this two months ago, they're legion.
[01:42:59.271 --> 01:43:06.235]  Not the type of lithium that's like an El Paso, so they have the lowest level of suicide or whatever, but the type that's in a plant.
[01:43:06.835 --> 01:43:13.098]  You were telling me, and I went and looked it up, it was true, is a miracle drug for depression, anger, problems.
[01:43:13.198 --> 01:43:15.619]  Explain this special type of lithium to people.
[01:43:15.899 --> 01:43:19.460]  I don't sell it, we probably should, but just explain to people about that.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:26.543]  Right, I mean it is readily available, and I've done a lot of work with the military, now I'm real close with the military, and military dating back
[01:43:26.983 --> 01:43:35.872]  You know, for the late 1800s has been a testing ground and an experiment military personnel for psychotic or psychotropic drugs.
[01:43:35.932 --> 01:43:40.737]  So the military is a perfect way for pharmaceutical companies to experiment.
[01:43:41.157 --> 01:43:43.520]  And one of the things that we... That's how you actually get stuff approved.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:44.761]  My dad's been in drug approval.
[01:43:45.001 --> 01:43:46.463]  You can only fast track through the Pentagon.
[01:43:47.182 --> 01:43:50.544]  Well, yeah, I mean, in the studies, I mean, that's a whole other thing.
[01:43:50.564 --> 01:44:00.610]  I mean, there really is no such thing as clinical trials, because in order to do an accurate clinical trial, you would have to clone somebody, expose them to the same diet every day, expose them to the same exercise program.
[01:44:00.630 --> 01:44:03.291]  I mean, it's impossible, because all of our biochemistry is different.
[01:44:03.311 --> 01:44:09.355]  So, that whole clinical trials in phase 1, 2, and 3 is nothing but fabricated results.
[01:44:09.815 --> 01:44:14.618]  All the heads of the studies are paid by the pharmaceutical companies, and it's just a big scam anyway.
[01:44:16.099 --> 01:44:22.304]  Lithium orotate is a natural form of lithium extracted from plants or erotic acid is actually added.
[01:44:22.364 --> 01:44:27.389]  It's not like the lithium carbonate that they give schizophrenic patients or anything like that.
[01:44:27.429 --> 01:44:38.579]  It's a natural form of lithium to just kind of help balance out your brain waves and it's a natural alternative for instead of you having to take Zoloft or Paxil or any type of the antidepressants.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:46.285]  A lot of the military and a lot of people that contact me that want to just get off all their medications, we switch them over to the natural substances.
[01:44:46.325 --> 01:44:48.407]  But lithium orotate is one of the most effective.
[01:44:48.427 --> 01:44:50.308]  And you were saying the effects have been very good.
[01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:51.309]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:51.349 --> 01:44:58.855]  I mean, again, you want to address the root cause of the problem, which is cleaning them out and reducing their exposure to the toxic chemicals.
[01:44:58.895 --> 01:44:59.756]  That's what I was reading.
[01:44:59.796 --> 01:45:06.101]  These serotonin reuptake inhibitors and these meth drugs, these Adderall and stuff, are so toxic to the body.
[01:45:07.405 --> 01:45:10.087]  Well, exactly, and the liver takes a beating over a period of time.
[01:45:10.107 --> 01:45:12.208]  You know, the liver is the detoxification organ.
[01:45:12.228 --> 01:45:15.570]  I mean, if you're on stimulants, I mean, that's methamphetamine right there.
[01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:29.877]  I mean, it's going to cause major side effects, insomnia, you're not going to be able to sleep, you know, you're going to go through rages, you're going to, you know, you might be able to focus for a little while, but over the long haul, it's just going to tear the body down to pieces, and then you're going to be on multiple medications.
[01:45:29.917 --> 01:45:32.259]  Yeah, speed kills, absolutely.
[01:45:32.879 --> 01:45:43.928]  I want to talk a little bit about other solutions here because, you know, I worked for about 15 years so hard on air, and I didn't have a fatalistic attitude.
[01:45:44.008 --> 01:45:52.335]  I just started eating whatever I wanted, was working 18 hours a day, not taking care of myself, and gained about 50 pounds more than I should.
[01:45:52.355 --> 01:45:58.120]  And it's been a long haul the last three, four years, getting on vitamins, minerals, drinking more water, exercising.
[01:45:58.581 --> 01:46:00.943]  But I have, over that time, lost a lot of weight.
[01:46:02.082 --> 01:46:03.043]  I've gotten a lot healthier.
[01:46:03.063 --> 01:46:04.104]  Everybody can see it now.
[01:46:04.784 --> 01:46:10.969]  And I did great with some of the longevity stuff at InfoWarsHealth.com, Beyond Tangy Tangerines, some of their products that we sell.
[01:46:10.989 --> 01:46:12.550]  They're wonderful at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:13.971]  That helps fund the operation.
[01:46:14.491 --> 01:46:22.217]  But when I got with you in the last eight, nine months, and you had Super Mill Vitality about to come out, you've been developing for years, you agreed to let me put it out exclusively.
[01:46:22.777 --> 01:46:32.641]  When you got me on your proprietary nascent iodine, put it out as survival shield, it turns blue on paper, not black like the other stuff that's really bound that people call nascent iodine.
[01:46:33.122 --> 01:46:41.205]  When you got me to develop the fluoride shield with these five compounds with the iodine, Shane Steiner is a huge power lifter naturally.
[01:46:41.485 --> 01:46:45.427]  He can bench press like, you know, 400 pounds like eight times.
[01:46:45.487 --> 01:46:47.168]  He can squat 600 pounds naturally.
[01:46:48.041 --> 01:46:52.522]  And he said, OK, Alex, I'm sure you sell real stuff, but I'll go on the Super Metal Vitality.
[01:46:52.922 --> 01:46:53.643]  I'll see what happens.
[01:46:53.663 --> 01:46:57.124]  We were just talking about, hey, you ought to see if you like it and you'll be a spokesman.
[01:46:57.644 --> 01:46:59.344]  He comes back and goes, I want a whole case of that.
[01:46:59.384 --> 01:47:00.005]  My friends want it.
[01:47:00.025 --> 01:47:04.286]  Three weeks later, he he says it's mentally gets him ready to work out.
[01:47:05.246 --> 01:47:14.077]  And he says it's just incredible mentally, and then of course with his friends and people it's the aphrodisiac effect, which you said we're not going to advertise it as that, but that's really what it does.
[01:47:14.397 --> 01:47:16.079]  And it turns women into crazed creatures.
[01:47:16.579 --> 01:47:18.301]  What is going on in Supermetal Vitality?
[01:47:19.182 --> 01:47:20.003]  What's going on?
[01:47:20.043 --> 01:47:24.348]  You know, I try to address the main problems and the situations that
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:28.643]  The government, the pharmaceutical companies are trying to destroy us.
[01:47:28.723 --> 01:47:40.833]  And one of the ones with the super male vitality, as you know, is to create a society of estrogen dominance, to take away the testosterone, to take away the true way a male is.
[01:47:40.913 --> 01:47:43.935]  I mean, to take away the fertility of the males.
[01:47:44.115 --> 01:47:48.319]  You know, a male's hormone levels decrease starting at age 28.
[01:47:49.039 --> 01:47:54.183]  And because of all the chemicals and the fluoride and all the endocrine disrupting compounds out there,
[01:47:54.944 --> 01:47:57.645]  We're not becoming males.
[01:47:57.685 --> 01:48:00.346]  I mean, you know, it's feminizing America.
[01:48:01.066 --> 01:48:03.067]  And so what I wanted to do was counteract that.
[01:48:03.107 --> 01:48:06.008]  I mean, there's always solutions to every situation.
[01:48:06.028 --> 01:48:07.448]  Well, why does it affect women even more?
[01:48:08.089 --> 01:48:11.030]  Well, it affects women because women produce testosterone too.
[01:48:11.050 --> 01:48:19.293]  And right now, women have estrogen levels through the roof, their progesterone levels are down to practically nothing, and their testosterone levels are practically nothing too.
[01:48:19.393 --> 01:48:19.833]  So it's not...
[01:48:21.093 --> 01:48:32.676]  What it does is it's a balanced hormone product that you can take that will naturally tell your body to produce the hormones that it needs.
[01:48:32.716 --> 01:48:37.658]  So that way it doesn't do like synthetic stuff that lower your hormones and just replace them.
[01:48:37.958 --> 01:48:39.118]  This makes your body release it.
[01:48:39.418 --> 01:48:45.040]  No, there is actually no testosterone or growth hormone or progesterone or anything in the formula.
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:54.424]  The formula is designed to naturally tell your body to produce what it needs and that's why it's so successful because you might need, you know... Why does it have the aphrodisiac effect?
[01:48:54.444 --> 01:48:55.144]  Let's just be honest.
[01:48:55.504 --> 01:49:08.114]  Well, because when your hormones are in balance, it's the natural order for you to procreate or for you to want to have sex or for you to want to, you know, seek, you know, a woman or for a woman to seek a man.
[01:49:08.194 --> 01:49:16.221]  So, when your hormones are balanced, that's just the natural, you secrete natural pheromones that come out in attractive substances from your body.
[01:49:16.881 --> 01:49:28.109]  And your blood flow starts to work again, you know, your testosterone, your growth hormone is regulated, so you have the desire... So basically, this counteracts what they're chemically doing to us, at least to a certain extent.
[01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.489]  Exactly.
[01:49:28.589 --> 01:49:29.529]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:31.611]  I've taken a lot of supplements and a lot of them are good.
[01:49:31.691 --> 01:49:33.332]  Your stuff is no joke.
[01:49:33.412 --> 01:49:37.495]  Infowarslife.com and your purchase helps support the broadcast, so it's a win-win.
[01:49:37.535 --> 01:49:43.439]  We're still running 15% off, because I produced a new ad and it's not ready yet, so why not just keep running it a few more weeks.
[01:49:43.459 --> 01:49:45.300]  15% off SuperMetal Vitality.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.822]  Comparable herb systems that are good use dry.
[01:49:48.862 --> 01:49:50.364]  We use wet and concentrated.
[01:49:50.824 --> 01:49:54.086]  Comparable systems are double the price and aren't even as strong as ours.
[01:49:54.106 --> 01:49:57.168]  There are some other stuff out there similar to this, it's just not as strong.
[01:49:57.188 --> 01:50:03.093]  I'm here to tell you, because, I mean, Steiner, you know, pointed out, he said, I've taken natural supplements, never had this effect, because he does natural stuff.
[01:50:03.633 --> 01:50:05.555]  And it really is the real deal.
[01:50:06.761 --> 01:50:18.650]  And I hope people will get it at Infowarslife.com that supports the broadcast, but also the Fluoride Detox, the Fluoride Shield, and then also the Nascent Iodine, what it does mentally for people.
[01:50:18.690 --> 01:50:20.512]  It just all works together in synergy.
[01:50:20.892 --> 01:50:33.562]  Well, the thing is, you know, I was happy to work with you when you called me up because you're giving people, I mean, every single day people know that we're being attacked on every single front, but then a lot of people don't know that there's solutions to all that.
[01:50:34.242 --> 01:50:40.784]  When you come out with these situations of, yes, there's so much fluoride in the water, and yes, we're being poisoned, what can you do about it?
[01:50:40.844 --> 01:50:45.725]  Well, these are the solutions, and the good news is, it funds the operation.
[01:50:45.765 --> 01:50:54.567]  It funds your operation, so you can get more information out there, and those individuals can get more information out to their friends and families, so it's a win-win situation.
[01:50:55.368 --> 01:50:56.528]  Of course.
[01:50:57.368 --> 01:50:58.008]  That was Steiner.
[01:50:58.028 --> 01:50:59.409]  He takes a little bit more than recommended does.
[01:51:01.485 --> 01:51:05.067]  We'll be back on SuperMetal Vitality, InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:51:05.087 --> 01:51:06.808]  I want to come back and talk about solutions.
[01:51:21.696 --> 01:51:27.563]  The Privacy Loophole I'm about to show you allows you to make all your sensitive information disappear in the next 30 days or less.
[01:51:27.784 --> 01:51:34.191]  Go to privacylockdown.com now to take your life off the grid and see the loophole in the NSA and FBI spying machine.
[01:51:34.372 --> 01:51:36.454]  Before they close the loophole forever.

[01:51:38.877 --> 01:51:48.120]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:48.900]  This capitalism?
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:55.082]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:51:55.122 --> 01:51:58.764]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:52:09.201 --> 01:52:15.630]  With new and ever-increasing health threats on the rise, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[01:52:15.850 --> 01:52:24.542]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver.

[01:52:38.592 --> 01:52:42.395]  The Science Digest Journal says, silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[01:52:42.595 --> 01:52:46.458]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern science.

[01:53:13.833 --> 01:53:17.836]  In 2008, I was dying with Lyme disease with daily PTSD.
[01:53:18.116 --> 01:53:19.417]  I lost everything.
[01:53:19.738 --> 01:53:21.539]  In 2009, a miracle happened.
[01:53:21.639 --> 01:53:24.301]  I discovered ION and the RNA drops.
[01:53:24.622 --> 01:53:27.664]  I'm Matthew David Hurtado, author of Misfit to Millions.

[01:54:01.797 --> 01:54:05.008]  If you want to change your life, you've got to change your life.
[01:54:19.105 --> 01:54:20.446]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:54:20.486 --> 01:54:23.687]  Ben Swan's going to be in here at the 7 After, 8 After with us.
[01:54:24.108 --> 01:54:25.608]  Talking about all the huge breaking news.
[01:54:26.409 --> 01:54:30.851]  Guys, will you go to whitehouse.gov and print me the new Obama executive order?
[01:54:30.891 --> 01:54:32.071]  Because it's on there.
[01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:32.712]  Thanks.
[01:54:34.212 --> 01:54:40.355]  Dr. Group, in this segment and the next segment that we have left with you, where do you see all this going?
[01:54:40.435 --> 01:54:40.756]  Because...
[01:54:41.775 --> 01:54:45.678]  They're consciously, in the White House Science Czar's own words, trying to dumb us down.
[01:54:46.378 --> 01:54:51.761]  They're consciously putting fluoride in the water that they know brain damages people like the Nazis and the Soviets did, on record.
[01:54:52.502 --> 01:54:56.224]  They're consciously trying to induct all our kids into the psychotropic system.
[01:54:57.165 --> 01:54:59.646]  They're consciously just wrecking everything.
[01:55:00.067 --> 01:55:01.768]  Where do you see the endgame going?
[01:55:03.174 --> 01:55:12.217]  For them, it's all about control of the population, control of the individual, and population control because, you know, it's just a big money game.
[01:55:13.397 --> 01:55:18.519]  But what I do see happening is people are waking up every single day by just getting this information out there.
[01:55:18.559 --> 01:55:30.682]  I mean, all the listeners, if you have any family members on psychotropic drugs, or if you're on psychotropic drugs, do the research and look at the history of them and try to get yourself off of them as soon as possible.
[01:55:31.603 --> 01:55:31.963]  I see
[01:55:33.183 --> 01:55:34.985]  You know, a serious war going on.
[01:55:35.025 --> 01:55:45.176]  I mean, you have the planned cabal over here that are trying to destroy us all, but then at the same time, you have the people that are trying to help everybody by getting the information out.
[01:55:45.196 --> 01:55:45.516]  That's right.
[01:55:45.536 --> 01:55:48.099]  Never forget there's good guys in the world and you're part of it, folks.
[01:55:48.439 --> 01:55:48.980]  Exactly.
[01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:53.106]  I mean, and the more the information gets out there, the more that people can make decisions.
[01:55:53.146 --> 01:56:01.197]  But, you know, part of the reason why they want everybody classified with mental illness is because they then they can say, well, you're not fit to make proper decisions.
[01:56:01.577 --> 01:56:03.180]  So they want to take away your mind.
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:03.700]  And that's like.
[01:56:04.468 --> 01:56:09.773]  You know, they've already been taking away your body and making you sick, but to take away your mind is the next step.
[01:56:09.813 --> 01:56:17.901]  And what I hope that happens is people start realizing and doing the research behind this and start focusing on natural solutions.
[01:56:17.941 --> 01:56:22.645]  And the natural solutions are addressing the root cause of why you're having problems to begin with.
[01:56:22.825 --> 01:56:30.233]  Why is Supermel Vitality and the iodine you developed for us and the fluoride shield, why is it so much better than the competitors?
[01:56:30.273 --> 01:56:37.961]  I mean, really, I went with you because you are the best and because we used them beforehand, the proprietary test supply.
[01:56:38.462 --> 01:56:41.205]  Why is it so good and why don't other people put stuff out this good?
[01:56:42.321 --> 01:57:03.690]  Well, number one, because they don't choose the right type of herbs, they don't choose fresh herbs, and then it's our processing technique that we developed, which was based on 16, you know, from the 1600s, some of the great alchemists and herbal masters back then that worked exclusively for the kings, like Paracelsus, and the way that they processed the herbs, the way that they picked the herbs, and the way that they can concentrate the herbs.
[01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:05.771]  I mean, we have a specific technique
[01:57:06.351 --> 01:57:14.518]  Where we utilize certain alcohol tinctures, for example, you can only pull about 40-45% of the active constituents in the herb out of it.
[01:57:14.938 --> 01:57:19.242]  And not only that, but alcohol in a formula is an endocrine disruptor anyway.
[01:57:19.302 --> 01:57:19.982]  It pickles it.
[01:57:20.623 --> 01:57:21.784]  So you don't really want to put...
[01:57:22.504 --> 01:57:26.490]  Uh, medications or natural medications or herbal tinctures and alcohol.
[01:57:26.530 --> 01:57:32.899]  You want to use it in a vegetable glycerin base, which is, which is safe and effective and it's a great extractive medium.
[01:57:32.959 --> 01:57:34.702]  Why does it get stronger in the bottle?
[01:57:34.762 --> 01:57:36.805]  Because when it was fresh and came, it wasn't as strong.
[01:57:36.825 --> 01:57:38.608]  Why is it, why does supernatural vitality get stronger?
[01:57:38.928 --> 01:57:57.077]  Well, the basis of true alchemy was that by utilizing the whole plant and using a certain proprietary technique that you can actually burn the ashes and purify the ashes and put those ashes back in the plant, it actually comes to life again or the energy comes in it.
[01:57:57.177 --> 01:57:58.698]  And so basically it gets stronger.
[01:57:58.718 --> 01:58:00.659]  We don't mean like Kooky turned lead to gold.
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:04.081]  We mean real stuff that was developed by the ancients.
[01:58:04.161 --> 01:58:05.322]  No, yeah, this is real stuff.
[01:58:05.362 --> 01:58:12.268]  As a matter of fact, you could turn a bottle over, like let's say, you know, you make it and you turn it over and there's nothing.
[01:58:12.648 --> 01:58:19.573]  You let that bottle sit for a year and then you turn it upside down and you can literally see crystals growing off the bottom of the bottle down into solution.
[01:58:19.914 --> 01:58:25.738]  So there's an act, something is happening in that formula and it's getting stronger and stronger and stronger with age.
[01:58:26.099 --> 01:58:30.923]  What I foresee happening with these formulas... You're saying the compounds are replicating in there?
[01:58:31.483 --> 01:58:44.596]  I'm saying that there's activity, like life, energetic life that's going on that's concentrating the formula, almost like a fine wine, and you're going to see 2010 super male vitalities going for, you know, $100.
[01:58:44.636 --> 01:58:45.837]  So it's like a vintage?
[01:58:46.037 --> 01:58:46.958]  Well, it's like a vintage.
[01:58:47.038 --> 01:58:48.199]  Wow, I get it.
[01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:48.780]  Man, that's heavy.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:49.881]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:58:50.342 --> 01:58:54.285]  Five more minutes with you, Dr. Grubb, my Green Beret doctor, and then we're going to have En Suant in here.
[01:58:59.375 --> 01:59:00.235]  The facts are in.
[01:59:00.395 --> 01:59:01.516]  The studies are legion.
[01:59:01.796 --> 01:59:09.179]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:59:09.319 --> 01:59:12.780]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:59:13.141 --> 01:59:13.541]  Simple.
[01:59:13.721 --> 01:59:18.123]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:59:18.443 --> 01:59:23.865]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:59:24.145 --> 01:59:29.509]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:59:29.690 --> 01:59:40.158]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:59:40.478 --> 01:59:44.721]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:59:45.041 --> 01:59:46.882]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[02:00:02.393 --> 02:00:04.334]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.795 --> 02:00:07.577]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:14.301 --> 02:00:18.482]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.142 --> 02:00:19.943]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.723 --> 02:00:21.623]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.263 --> 02:00:25.944]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.464 --> 02:00:30.566]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.826 --> 02:00:38.208]  Dr. Griff was just explaining how he's got some of the organic, herbal,
[02:00:39.433 --> 02:00:41.796]  Systems he's developed from six, seven, eight years ago.
[02:00:41.816 --> 02:00:43.117]  They're actually growing crystals in them.
[02:00:43.458 --> 02:00:56.132]  He was explaining that it's the different elements and things that are in there literally alive because they never basically kill it like a real bottle of wine that just gets better as a vintage.
[02:00:56.152 --> 02:00:56.933]  Explain that to people.
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:07.409]  Well, it was based on the alchemist Paracelsus in the 1600s, who really termed the spagyric, which means to separate and recombine.
[02:01:07.429 --> 02:01:22.703]  So what he did was he separated the essential oils from the plant, he separated the other constituents from the plant, and the minerals from the plant, and then he fermented the plant to create activity in it, and then ultimately, long story short, he added everything back into the plant.
[02:01:23.263 --> 02:01:23.403]  Yeah.
[02:01:40.993 --> 02:01:42.154]  Doing herbal extractions.
[02:01:42.235 --> 02:01:48.822]  I didn't like the fact that people were just throwing a bunch of herbs and alcohol, Everclear for example, and letting them sit for a couple weeks and then bottling them.
[02:01:49.243 --> 02:01:54.689]  I went back all the way in history to the Egyptian times, everything, and tried to figure out the best way.
[02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:56.952]  That's right, you pioneered using glycerin.
[02:01:57.452 --> 02:01:59.393]  Yeah, this is all pioneered.
[02:01:59.433 --> 02:02:10.380]  I mean, there's nobody... I mean, it would literally take years for someone to come up with this type of technology, but we're basing it on old technologies and new technology, because they didn't have the type of equipment back then.
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:12.841]  You use sound systems and all sorts of secret stuff.
[02:02:12.861 --> 02:02:20.746]  Yeah, we use all different types of high-energy sound pulses and all kinds of stuff that's completely cold-processed, see?
[02:02:21.326 --> 02:02:26.949]  You know, even the alcohol tinctures will boil them and boil down the herbs and take them up to high temperatures.
[02:02:26.989 --> 02:02:29.871]  That's how you keep it cold-pressed.
[02:02:29.951 --> 02:02:35.274]  Yeah, we keep all the temperatures under 100 degrees usually during the whole extraction processes and everything.
[02:02:36.094 --> 02:02:44.759]  But it can still take up to six months sometimes just to do an extraction and keep it in its high... No, no, we have trouble getting enough of it because you guys will sell no wine until it's time.
[02:02:45.379 --> 02:02:46.120]  Right, exactly.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:55.193]  So that's the process of ours so that it actually gets stronger with time and what I foresee in the future is that you could have an herb
[02:02:56.249 --> 02:03:04.095]  That was made in 2009, go on auction for hundreds of dollars, as opposed to an Herb-8 in 2014.
[02:03:04.155 --> 02:03:16.726]  Sure, because before I pulled the trigger, I had the test bottles, a whole bunch of them, and I was like, man, over time they got stronger, and when we got the big stuff in us, this isn't as strong, and the stuff that's been there for a month, now it's strong.
[02:03:17.446 --> 02:03:18.367]  And it's getting stronger.
[02:03:18.667 --> 02:03:20.147]  So I guess it does change like wine.
[02:03:20.348 --> 02:03:20.628]  Right.
[02:03:20.688 --> 02:03:21.088]  It does.
[02:03:21.208 --> 02:03:21.588]  It does.
[02:03:21.748 --> 02:03:32.334]  I mean, the way I see the herbal extraction industry going is that the fact that they're going to be producing and holding a certain amount back, just like the wine industry, you know, from 2008 wines, 2009 wines.
[02:03:32.754 --> 02:03:41.538]  What I hear now, actually, is that people as an investment are buying pre-2010 California bottles of wine because that was pre-Fukushima.
[02:03:42.179 --> 02:03:45.921]  Now, personally, in my opinion, I think most of the stuff is contaminated over there.
[02:03:46.821 --> 02:04:00.344]  Eventually, one day, let's say if California is uninhabitable because of Fukushima, you know, somebody might have a 2010-2009 bottle of wine that was grown in California, you know, that would be a good investment because it's going to get better with age.
[02:04:00.444 --> 02:04:00.844]  Amazing.
[02:04:00.864 --> 02:04:03.345]  We're developing some other products together as well.
[02:04:03.425 --> 02:04:04.525]  I appreciate you coming in.
[02:04:04.885 --> 02:04:06.445]  We've got an hour until the show's over.
[02:04:06.465 --> 02:04:07.506]  I've got Ben Swan coming in.
[02:04:07.606 --> 02:04:13.687]  If Anthony or somebody would like to sit down with you and go over that whole report uninterrupted for the nightly news, we could air it next week.
[02:04:14.187 --> 02:04:16.267]  I know we kept a few reports when you were in here last time.
[02:04:16.307 --> 02:04:31.410]  I'm not even sure all those have aired, but if you want to scramble the X-Wings over there and do a whole report breaking down the plan to drug the entire population or something, I think it'd be good to have you run through that concisely and say a 20-minute special report, Dr. Group.
[02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:41.112]  Yeah, what I like to do is I like to just give people the actual factual numbers and statistics of what's going on, because that's pretty shocking when you can actually see those numbers.
[02:04:42.012 --> 02:04:45.834]  And not only that, it motivates you to do something about it.
[02:04:45.854 --> 02:04:45.994]  Sure.
[02:04:46.014 --> 02:04:46.394]  We're out of time.
[02:04:46.414 --> 02:04:47.135]  Give me your website out.
[02:04:47.635 --> 02:04:48.995]  GlobalHealingCenter.com.
[02:04:49.316 --> 02:04:49.636]  All right.
[02:04:50.296 --> 02:04:53.838]  And you can get all the great products he's developed for us at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:04:54.218 --> 02:04:56.099]  And then you're funding the tip of the spear of the Info War.
[02:04:56.139 --> 02:04:58.420]  Look, try Survival Shield, Nacin Ionine.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:59.680]  Try the Fluoride Shield.
[02:05:00.041 --> 02:05:01.261]  Try Supermell Vitality.
[02:05:01.942 --> 02:05:04.183]  All we've gotten is great reviews.
[02:05:04.243 --> 02:05:06.063]  I mean, I only sell stuff that's dynamite.
[02:05:06.764 --> 02:05:07.224]  It's dynamite.
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:12.122]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:05:12.362 --> 02:05:17.246]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:05:17.506 --> 02:05:25.372]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:05:25.633 --> 02:05:29.936]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:05:30.156 --> 02:05:33.959]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:05:34.119 --> 02:05:39.823]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:05:40.063 --> 02:05:42.845]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:05:43.225 --> 02:05:48.469]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[02:06:04.519 --> 02:06:14.042]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:06:14.202 --> 02:06:17.163]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:06:17.323 --> 02:06:22.544]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:06:22.885 --> 02:06:24.465]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:06:24.805 --> 02:06:26.147]  We are what we eat.
[02:06:26.447 --> 02:06:30.791]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:06:31.112 --> 02:06:35.096]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:06:35.336 --> 02:06:37.678]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:06:37.899 --> 02:06:43.845]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:07:09.278 --> 02:07:19.663]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:07:19.963 --> 02:07:21.824]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:07:22.024 --> 02:07:22.705]  Fluoride!
[02:07:22.905 --> 02:07:24.706]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:07:24.826 --> 02:07:31.129]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:07:31.389 --> 02:07:36.193]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:07:36.313 --> 02:07:42.398]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:07:42.638 --> 02:07:44.800]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:47.682]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:07:47.982 --> 02:07:51.385]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:07:51.485 --> 02:07:56.708]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:56.908 --> 02:08:01.711]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:08:15.011 --> 02:08:20.616]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.116 --> 02:08:21.617]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:22.457 --> 02:08:29.343]  Infowars.com, yeah.
[02:08:29.623 --> 02:08:35.869]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:38.519 --> 02:08:44.766]  Well, they are moving to block visas of Russian diplomats and personnel moving around the world.
[02:08:45.667 --> 02:08:49.632]  Obama signed an executive order to start grabbing their property internationally.
[02:08:49.732 --> 02:08:50.993]  This is an act of war.
[02:08:51.013 --> 02:08:55.479]  You know, the executive order signed today, Obama has given the speech.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.781]  This is really a new Cold War.
[02:08:58.945 --> 02:09:04.190]  It's absolutely incredible to see all of this unfolding.
[02:09:04.210 --> 02:09:08.915]  You know, our guest once got to ask Obama, what was it about the drone program?
[02:09:08.955 --> 02:09:15.201]  And we have a clip, a clip of that we're going to be playing here in just a moment.
[02:09:15.721 --> 02:09:19.525]  But I got to tell you, folks, things are just getting crazy.
[02:09:19.965 --> 02:09:22.188]  This Ukraine situation is huge.
[02:09:22.828 --> 02:09:23.929]  The Crimea has voted.
[02:09:23.969 --> 02:09:30.854]  That little sliver of land by Russia down to the south there to the sea has voted to join Russia.
[02:09:30.875 --> 02:09:33.056]  It's been part of Russia many times in history.
[02:09:33.497 --> 02:09:35.698]  And again, I'm not saying Vladimir Putin's a great guy.
[02:09:36.079 --> 02:09:39.922]  The point is the West is starting all this and they want a new Cold War.
[02:09:40.422 --> 02:09:42.444]  John McCain in testimony yesterday
[02:09:44.154 --> 02:09:53.259]  And today he said that we need to increase defense spending not cut it because of the new situation with Russia.
[02:09:53.959 --> 02:09:58.422]  So it is a very serious situation to say the least that is unfolding.
[02:09:58.542 --> 02:10:00.523]  I want to get into all of this in the future.
[02:10:01.363 --> 02:10:05.404]  Of the media and so much more with Ben Swan of benswan.com.
[02:10:05.664 --> 02:10:06.784]  Ben, it's great to have you here, buddy.
[02:10:06.944 --> 02:10:08.284]  Great to be in studio with you, Alex.
[02:10:08.525 --> 02:10:10.145]  You are here for the Bitcoin Conference.
[02:10:10.245 --> 02:10:10.805]  Absolutely.
[02:10:10.845 --> 02:10:16.866]  Here for the Bitcoin Conference, which is going on here in Austin and spoke this morning talking a lot about Bitcoin and capitalism.
[02:10:16.886 --> 02:10:21.827]  Look, whether you're a big fan of Bitcoin or not, in my opinion, Bitcoin is a great example of capitalism.
[02:10:21.867 --> 02:10:29.749]  And that's what we need to kind of reinstate in the American public's mind is what capitalism is and how it works and the risks
[02:10:30.029 --> 02:10:34.352]  Well, I totally agree with you that it's a good idea to have cryptocurrencies, and I totally agree with competition in currencies.
[02:10:34.372 --> 02:10:37.054]  We shouldn't have the private dollar reserve running everything to their fake dollar.
[02:10:51.824 --> 02:10:55.587]  But at the same time, I've had concerns about the providence of Bitcoin itself.
[02:10:56.187 --> 02:10:58.749]  And now we have the CEO found dead in Singapore.
[02:10:58.769 --> 02:11:05.354]  A young American woman who ran the first meta Bitcoin exchange was found dead in her Singapore apartment last week.
[02:11:05.394 --> 02:11:07.556]  Police are investigating the unnatural death.
[02:11:08.236 --> 02:11:14.721]  And you've got all this stuff, lawsuits firing up around it, Bitcoin exchanges disappearing.
[02:11:15.401 --> 02:11:17.283]  Where do you think Bitcoin itself is going?
[02:11:17.523 --> 02:11:20.765]  Well, Bitcoin itself, I think its future is pretty unclear, right?
[02:11:20.905 --> 02:11:22.827]  Will it survive or will it fall apart?
[02:11:23.107 --> 02:11:24.167]  Who really knows at this point?
[02:11:24.888 --> 02:11:29.491]  I think that as long as the Feds see that it is a viable currency, they're going to try to get involved in it.
[02:11:29.531 --> 02:11:31.512]  As soon as they get involved in it, Bitcoin is dead.
[02:11:32.093 --> 02:11:34.454]  But there are other currencies that are popping up at the same time.
[02:11:34.494 --> 02:11:44.521]  And so again, I think the opportunity here is one where we say, look, the idea of having free exchange between people without the government being involved in it is something that is catching on among people.
[02:11:44.881 --> 02:11:46.863]  That's where I think the encouraging signs are.
[02:11:46.883 --> 02:11:47.323]  And by the way,
[02:11:47.523 --> 02:11:48.043]  You know, when Mt.
[02:11:48.063 --> 02:11:51.525]  Gox collapsed and people said, oh, this is a sign that it's bad news for Bitcoin.
[02:11:51.545 --> 02:11:53.126]  I actually think that was good news for Bitcoin.
[02:11:53.466 --> 02:11:53.666]  Mt.
[02:11:53.686 --> 02:11:54.766]  Gox was a bad player.
[02:11:54.806 --> 02:11:55.787]  They needed to collapse.
[02:11:56.107 --> 02:12:03.570]  And so when you have someone who is collapsing because they are not responding well to people or because they're corrupt individuals, you want them out of the marketplace.
[02:12:03.630 --> 02:12:06.692]  That's how the market regulates itself without federal intervention.
[02:12:06.732 --> 02:12:11.434]  Sure, I just go with my gut and just the whole history of it and the shadowiness of it.
[02:12:11.474 --> 02:12:15.256]  And, you know, the federal government's trying to develop their own systems right now with MIT and Stanford.
[02:12:15.936 --> 02:12:17.698]  So, again, I'm not against it.
[02:12:18.018 --> 02:12:21.882]  And if folks want to ride a bubble up and back down, that's their business.
[02:12:22.582 --> 02:12:24.885]  I just, my gut tells me danger, Will Robinson.
[02:12:25.225 --> 02:12:25.445]  Yeah.
[02:12:25.665 --> 02:12:31.931]  Well, and I think when you look at what's happening with Bitcoin right now, as you said, it kind of goes up and down and it's very volatile.
[02:12:32.572 --> 02:12:34.894]  And the beauty of it being a voluntary exchange.
[02:12:34.994 --> 02:12:37.237]  Unlike the Federal Reserve, no, which is not voluntary.
[02:12:37.257 --> 02:12:38.498]  We're all forced into that system.
[02:12:38.898 --> 02:12:41.321]  This is a voluntary system so people can get in or get out.
[02:12:41.341 --> 02:12:48.950]  And my suspicion is that Bitcoin is just going to be the bridge into a lot of other cryptocurrencies, a lot of other virtual currencies that will pop up.
[02:12:53.675 --> 02:13:03.621]  And two Lone Star Emmy Awards, and of course he's had shows on different stations across the country, very popular with his reality check on a Fox News affiliate that became popular nationwide.
[02:13:04.061 --> 02:13:15.447]  And then when they basically tried to censor him, he left to start his own media organization, BenSwan.com, and is really doing first-rate reporting on basic liberty issues, and that's what's so exciting about it.
[02:13:15.467 --> 02:13:19.570]  Look, I can ask a lot of questions, and I've got a bunch of news I want to get into with you.
[02:13:20.430 --> 02:13:22.692]  Front and center, what's number one on your radar?
[02:13:22.712 --> 02:13:24.693]  I'm gonna give you the floor for the next seven minutes.
[02:13:25.053 --> 02:13:27.054]  Ben Swan, tell us what's on your mind.
[02:13:27.154 --> 02:13:38.702]  Well look, I think obviously this story in Ukraine is a huge story as you said, and I think what's getting missed here, and I think you'd probably agree with this, you know, we have this new mantra that we use at benswan.com, that humanity is greater than politics.
[02:13:39.122 --> 02:13:45.046]  And I think what we're seeing in Ukraine right now is that humanity is not being taken care of here, right?
[02:13:45.086 --> 02:13:46.047]  That at the end of the day,
[02:13:47.116 --> 02:13:54.282]  Whether it's the EU, as you said, the West trying to come in and really, with the EU, force themselves onto the Ukrainian people.
[02:13:55.022 --> 02:13:57.544]  Force them into an EU system, a fiat money system.
[02:13:57.704 --> 02:13:59.766]  They're not looking out for the people in Ukraine.
[02:13:59.926 --> 02:14:02.328]  It's about issuing more debt and enslaving more people.
[02:14:02.688 --> 02:14:05.972]  And then on the Russian side, I see Putin, like you said, not the best guy in the world.
[02:14:06.072 --> 02:14:08.554]  I think he sees an opportunity, and it's an opportunity to get in there.
[02:14:08.875 --> 02:14:16.963]  And so the people of Ukraine are the ones who, at the end of the day, are ultimately going to have to decide who their new leader is, because you have very powerful forces who are attempting to take over.
[02:14:17.003 --> 02:14:21.047]  But don't believe this story that we keep hearing in Western media about how the U.S.
[02:14:21.087 --> 02:14:22.969]  is just trying to go in and help the freedom fighters.
[02:14:23.230 --> 02:14:23.510]  They're not.
[02:14:23.530 --> 02:14:25.092]  They're trying to put these people into the EU.
[02:14:25.612 --> 02:14:27.694]  Well, there's a story up on Infowars.com.
[02:14:27.774 --> 02:14:29.275]  Ron Paul, U.S.
[02:14:29.335 --> 02:14:31.037]  attempting empire building in Ukraine.
[02:14:31.417 --> 02:14:35.021]  Russia already ran the Crimea, the gas lines, the military bases there.
[02:14:35.481 --> 02:14:37.683]  They were basically forced to come in and secure their assets.
[02:14:37.703 --> 02:14:44.129]  Again, I'm not even defending that, but under common law maxims, the West started the overthrow of the elected government.
[02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.389]  That's right.
[02:14:44.529 --> 02:14:51.015]  They're in there, and now, what do you make of Obama signing an executive order to start grabbing the assets of any Russians they want?
[02:14:51.375 --> 02:14:52.675]  I mean, this is a big escalation.
[02:14:52.735 --> 02:14:53.816]  That is a big escalation.
[02:14:53.836 --> 02:14:55.416]  And look, it always comes back to money, right?
[02:14:55.536 --> 02:14:58.177]  All these steps that we take, which we claim are not an act of war.
[02:14:58.237 --> 02:14:58.757]  I agree with you.
[02:14:59.057 --> 02:15:03.938]  Whenever you talk about sanctions, when you talk about seizing assets, those are overt acts of war.
[02:15:04.038 --> 02:15:09.440]  And that's where, again, I think the American people have to pay attention to what's happening here because we're being drawn into another conflict.
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:12.241]  China has already said that they side with Russia on this conflict.
[02:15:12.281 --> 02:15:14.621]  They already side with their right to be there.
[02:15:14.901 --> 02:15:16.902]  And again, the other thing you have to remember is that in Crimea,
[02:15:17.202 --> 02:15:22.364]  It's not that the Russians are moving into an area where the mass population doesn't want them.
[02:15:22.624 --> 02:15:26.966]  The mass population is begging Russia to come in, asking them to come and secure these areas.
[02:15:27.026 --> 02:15:29.046]  Most of these people have Russian heritage and speak Russian.
[02:15:29.086 --> 02:15:35.869]  So it's hardly kind of, you know, an invasion, I guess, as it's being scripted in the Western media.
[02:15:37.503 --> 02:15:40.345]  When I look at the London Guardian, they're like, oh, it's some visa restrictions.
[02:15:40.445 --> 02:15:41.806]  I've got the executive order.
[02:15:42.146 --> 02:15:43.667]  You guys can put that on screen if you want.
[02:15:44.407 --> 02:15:50.771]  It's the same thing as that Africa executive order, where they can just grab the assets of anybody they claim is aiding radicals.
[02:15:51.832 --> 02:15:55.274]  So it's just the absolute power to do whatever they want.
[02:15:55.994 --> 02:16:02.719]  Any person or individual or entity who the State Department says is
[02:16:03.797 --> 02:16:12.403]  Involved in a problem with Ukraine to be responsible for, complicit in, or engaged in, directly or indirectly, any of the following.
[02:16:13.083 --> 02:16:16.906]  Actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Ukraine.
[02:16:17.386 --> 02:16:19.028]  The West just overthrew our elected government.
[02:16:19.528 --> 02:16:20.869]  So they should put sanctions on Obama.
[02:16:21.449 --> 02:16:23.231]  Or on Secretary of State Kerry.
[02:16:23.811 --> 02:16:28.634]  Actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
[02:16:29.135 --> 02:16:30.476]  Well, what is the West doing?
[02:16:30.516 --> 02:16:32.097]  They know Russia will end up taking part of it.
[02:16:33.323 --> 02:16:37.447]  Misappropriation of state assets of Ukraine or economically significant entity in Ukraine.
[02:16:37.987 --> 02:16:40.229]  And then it just goes into the authority to grab the assets.
[02:16:40.249 --> 02:16:40.930]  This is a big deal.
[02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:46.195]  Well, and as you said, this is a democratically elected government that was overthrown in Ukraine.
[02:16:46.215 --> 02:16:48.837]  So it wasn't as if this happened through a peaceful process.
[02:16:49.258 --> 02:16:55.783]  If you're going to side with someone, technically, shouldn't our government side with the democratically elected government of Ukraine and say this was a coup?
[02:16:56.604 --> 02:16:57.645]  But they don't do that, right?
[02:16:57.685 --> 02:17:00.288]  And so what we're seeing again, and the other thing too, come on.
[02:17:00.928 --> 02:17:05.836]  John Kerry, Secretary of State Kerry, getting up and talking about how we can't be meddling in other countries' affairs.
[02:17:05.876 --> 02:17:10.162]  You can't allow some country to come up with some loose reason just to enter the country.
[02:17:10.723 --> 02:17:12.466]  It's the same thing he was doing with Syria.
[02:17:12.486 --> 02:17:16.111]  It's like he's trying to make hypocritical, satirical jokes.
[02:17:16.291 --> 02:17:16.532]  It is.
[02:17:16.812 --> 02:17:17.052]  It is.
[02:17:17.472 --> 02:17:22.354]  It's almost comical, if it weren't so sad, that when he's making these statements, because it's the exact same thing the U.S.
[02:17:22.434 --> 02:17:27.777]  is doing, claiming they needed to be in Syria, what we did when we went into Iraq to chase down invisible weapons of mass destruction.
[02:17:28.077 --> 02:17:32.859]  When the West does it, it's considered spreading democracy, and I guess when Russia does it, it's considered an invasion.
[02:17:33.279 --> 02:17:34.519]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:17:34.539 --> 02:17:35.220]  You're a smart guy.
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:36.240]  What's your gut tell you?
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:38.281]  Are things getting better or worse?
[02:17:38.321 --> 02:17:42.463]  I know people are waking up, but at the same time, the establishment has the power and just doesn't seem to care.
[02:17:43.143 --> 02:17:56.275]  Well, I think part of the problem in this particular situation, unlike in the Middle Eastern conflicts, I think when people look at Russia as a whole in America, there is almost this intrinsic, almost DNA response that Russia's bad and the USA is good, right?
[02:17:56.455 --> 02:17:57.957]  It's Rocky IV all over again.
[02:17:58.217 --> 02:18:02.981]  We keep falling back into that mindset, and so I think media is playing that game, really playing that game right now.
[02:18:03.241 --> 02:18:05.383]  That is, if it's Russia, it must be bad.
[02:18:05.483 --> 02:18:08.445]  If it's the USA, it must be good, because these are the Cold War sides.
[02:18:08.665 --> 02:18:12.088]  I mean, this is what we were... But really, it's globalists above both our countries... Exactly.
[02:18:12.108 --> 02:18:13.269]  ...playing us off against each other.
[02:18:13.289 --> 02:18:14.210]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:18.393]  And in the end, globalists win, because that's their goal, is to play these sides against each other.
[02:18:18.413 --> 02:18:21.195]  And ultimately, through... There you go.
[02:18:21.275 --> 02:18:22.336]  They're quick about that, Rocky.
[02:18:22.496 --> 02:18:23.577]  I will break you!
[02:18:23.857 --> 02:18:24.378]  That was quick.
[02:18:24.958 --> 02:18:27.321]  Yeah, you know, and that's ultimately what it comes down to.
[02:18:27.381 --> 02:18:30.926]  It's about controlling the money, about controlling the populations.
[02:18:31.066 --> 02:18:32.708]  That's what the globalists are interested in.
[02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.770]  Well, that's right.
[02:18:33.790 --> 02:18:34.190]  I just know this.
[02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:36.553]  Vladimir Putin pays people to get married and have children.
[02:18:36.914 --> 02:18:39.698]  And the CPS tries to not take people's kids in Russia.
[02:18:40.138 --> 02:18:41.760]  And they don't have forced inoculations there.
[02:18:42.361 --> 02:18:44.342]  And their media more and more sounds like my show.
[02:18:45.062 --> 02:18:48.504]  And then me, because they've been under such tyranny, they're kind of going the other direction in some ways.
[02:18:48.904 --> 02:18:51.065]  They're going into tyranny and some others because of outside pressure.
[02:18:51.366 --> 02:18:56.008]  I look at us, the people that run us, absolutely act like textbook authoritarians.
[02:18:56.868 --> 02:18:58.389]  Yeah, well, they are authoritarians.
[02:18:58.669 --> 02:18:59.209]  They believe that.
[02:18:59.229 --> 02:19:10.015]  Look, if you look at everything that the NSA has done, if you look at the Obama administration wanting to put an FCC monitor in the newsrooms around the country to make sure that they know the news process by which news they have.
[02:19:10.435 --> 02:19:11.419]  Why am I lying in the sand?
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:12.865]  I'm not having some federal...
[02:19:15.169 --> 02:19:20.931]  Minion, or to quote Tony Montana, Chiavano in every corner, telling me what to eat, what to sleep, what to wear.
[02:19:21.211 --> 02:19:22.651]  You know about a sheep, blah, blah.
[02:19:22.691 --> 02:19:24.052]  I mean, this has got to end.
[02:19:24.552 --> 02:19:25.572]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[02:19:25.612 --> 02:19:30.234]  I mean, it flies in the face of every fundamental basic right that we have.
[02:19:30.274 --> 02:19:35.735]  And certainly in the media or in the press, the freedom of press is about having the right to be able to dissent.
[02:19:36.035 --> 02:19:37.856]  And that's what they want to remove, is the right to dissent.
[02:19:37.936 --> 02:19:40.017]  Ben Swan, that's my next question.
[02:19:40.037 --> 02:19:43.538]  You've come from the mainstream media into the new media that's becoming dominant.
[02:19:44.298 --> 02:19:54.622]  I want to talk about the media wars and where you expect things to go, because I think when the history books or the digital histories are written, it's going to be things like Infowars.com, DrugsReport.com.
[02:19:54.662 --> 02:20:05.185]  It's going to be things like House of Cards and people like Ben Swine, who are going to be known as signposts on the death of the old state-run media.
[02:20:05.225 --> 02:20:07.306]  I want to talk about that straight ahead.

[02:20:39.290 --> 02:20:40.310]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:40.390 --> 02:20:44.731]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:44.891 --> 02:20:50.513]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:50.593 --> 02:20:53.954]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:54.174 --> 02:20:56.734]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:56.854 --> 02:21:01.675]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:01.815 --> 02:21:02.035]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:02.055 --> 02:21:03.416]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:08.777 --> 02:21:09.177]  Question.

[02:23:07.705 --> 02:23:18.029]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:20.170]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:23:20.350 --> 02:23:21.051]  Fluoride!
[02:23:21.251 --> 02:23:23.512]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:23:23.652 --> 02:23:29.454]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:23:29.694 --> 02:23:34.455]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:23:34.595 --> 02:23:40.617]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:23:40.877 --> 02:23:43.017]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:23:43.277 --> 02:23:45.878]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:23:46.178 --> 02:23:49.539]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[02:24:06.465 --> 02:24:15.508]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:16.208 --> 02:24:18.369]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:39.111]  The establishment has controlled the debate and really the maps of the mind for a long time where state-run, establishment, corporate-run big media is called mainstream media and then we're the alternative media but now on every metric they are collapsing in free fall.
[02:24:39.712 --> 02:24:47.257]  Alternative media is proliferating in the quality and the selection but also in the viewership, the listenership, the readership.
[02:24:48.538 --> 02:24:53.700]  But it's also moving towards a singularity where only the best new media is becoming dominant.
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:57.581]  Now there's kind of a saturation of alternative media or new media.
[02:24:57.921 --> 02:24:59.662]  It's creating competition there as well.
[02:25:00.242 --> 02:25:05.724]  It was easy to come to this game, you know, 20 years ago and be alternative media, then to become the new dominant media.
[02:25:05.764 --> 02:25:16.127]  But there's also going to be a singularity, not just for dinosaur state-run media, but for all other media as well, where everyone basically becomes a reporter and people learn to just use
[02:25:16.747 --> 02:25:21.830]  You know, individuals and outlets as another perspective, or like a port into reality.
[02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:44.124]  Ben Swan, if they can shoot for almost nothing a show like Game of Thrones that's seen hundreds of millions of times and destroys the Hollywood model, if Variety's reporting that Hollywood is literally in a mass exodus out of California, if people run from socialism, run from collectivism, in a slave revolt, if they run from mainstream media, what ends up happening?
[02:25:44.404 --> 02:25:46.185]  What do you see at the end of this process?
[02:25:46.465 --> 02:25:48.967]  Well, I think what you're describing is very accurate, right?
[02:25:49.167 --> 02:25:56.453]  I think there is a kind of an emergence of new media, and I don't use the term alternative very often, because you're new media, right?
[02:25:56.493 --> 02:26:00.797]  You are the new way of people getting information, understanding what's going on around them.
[02:26:00.817 --> 02:26:01.517]  And I love what you said.
[02:26:01.857 --> 02:26:04.980]  It really is a process of people saying, here are perspectives.
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:08.021]  And then I'm drawing my own opinions, which is what you're encouraging them to do, right?
[02:26:08.221 --> 02:26:09.081]  Be critical thinkers.
[02:26:09.481 --> 02:26:11.521]  Mainstream media doesn't encourage you to be a critical thinker.
[02:26:11.601 --> 02:26:12.502]  They're the experts.
[02:26:12.862 --> 02:26:13.662]  They're the authority.
[02:26:13.702 --> 02:26:16.682]  They're going to tell you what to think, and there is nothing else to consider.
[02:26:16.722 --> 02:26:18.683]  And there's no other viewpoint, no other idea.
[02:26:19.103 --> 02:26:22.004]  And so I think what we're going to see is exactly what you said.
[02:26:22.264 --> 02:26:23.784]  More and more new media popping up.
[02:26:23.824 --> 02:26:29.465]  And then as that media pops up, it's presenting perspectives and ideas and points of view.
[02:26:29.845 --> 02:26:32.686]  People say that's interesting, and they're adding it kind of to their collective thought.
[02:26:33.834 --> 02:26:35.355]  That sounds like a renaissance to me.
[02:26:35.535 --> 02:26:35.735]  Yeah.
[02:26:36.295 --> 02:26:37.876]  Yeah, I think that's exactly what it is, right?
[02:26:38.237 --> 02:26:42.739]  I think the Internet has become what the printing press was, Gutenberg's printing press.
[02:26:43.079 --> 02:26:46.081]  It's this ability for people to say, I no longer need to be read to.
[02:26:46.601 --> 02:26:46.721]  Right?
[02:26:46.761 --> 02:26:48.302]  I have the ability to read for myself.
[02:26:48.763 --> 02:26:50.804]  I have the ability to gather information for myself.
[02:26:50.864 --> 02:26:52.025]  That's what's happening with the Internet.
[02:26:52.245 --> 02:26:55.667]  But see, for too long, the Internet was simply just a place where you could find information.
[02:26:55.967 --> 02:27:02.831]  Now you've got the folks who are curating that information, folks like yourself, who say, OK, now let's help you find information and get it to you.
[02:27:03.351 --> 02:27:04.693]  And that's where media is most successful.
[02:27:05.053 --> 02:27:09.898]  And I just say, hey, I think it's interesting that they just put sanctions on the Russian government.
[02:27:09.958 --> 02:27:10.119]  Right.
[02:27:10.139 --> 02:27:11.821]  And they're going to be grabbing their bank accounts.
[02:27:11.861 --> 02:27:13.823]  I think it's interesting the Bitcoin CEO died.
[02:27:14.223 --> 02:27:16.826]  We can cover so much more because it's not just the formulaic.
[02:27:17.607 --> 02:27:18.328]  Here's the sports.
[02:27:18.368 --> 02:27:19.029]  Here's the weather.
[02:27:19.109 --> 02:27:20.030]  Here's a shooting.
[02:27:20.050 --> 02:27:21.992]  You know, here's a car wreck.
[02:27:22.592 --> 02:27:24.815]  This person came to town and here's a Prozac ad.
[02:27:24.855 --> 02:27:25.515]  That's right, that's right.
[02:27:25.675 --> 02:27:32.480]  And I gotta tell you too, and this is a, it's a little bit, you know, I guess to the side, but just what we just talked about right now when your guys popped up that Rocky IV video.
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.062]  It's funny to me because I spent 15 years in broadcast journalism, Alex.
[02:27:37.523 --> 02:27:39.144]  15 years working for TV stations.
[02:27:39.184 --> 02:27:44.447]  I have never, ever called from an anchor desk for a piece of video and have been able to have someone pop it up.
[02:27:44.907 --> 02:27:47.568]  I mean, that's how fast the pace is in this place.
[02:27:47.588 --> 02:27:48.549]  So what you guys... Well, watch this.
[02:27:48.569 --> 02:27:52.691]  I'm going to tell them to move the camera more that way because there's too much room on this side.
[02:27:54.252 --> 02:27:56.853]  We don't want you right in the middle, but we want you exactly right like that.
[02:27:57.073 --> 02:27:57.974]  No, no, but that's the thing.
[02:27:58.234 --> 02:28:00.575]  People can see all the sausage being made right here.
[02:28:00.615 --> 02:28:00.895]  That's right.
[02:28:01.115 --> 02:28:03.175]  I don't try to form all my words perfectly.
[02:28:03.195 --> 02:28:05.676]  It's a stream of consciousness.
[02:28:05.896 --> 02:28:06.956]  And it's authenticity, right?
[02:28:07.196 --> 02:28:09.017]  That's what this experience has to be.
[02:28:09.037 --> 02:28:10.337]  It has to be an authentic experience.
[02:28:10.377 --> 02:28:17.538]  It's not this polished, hey, we've got to make everything look a certain way, sound a certain way, so that we're very careful in how everything comes out.
[02:28:17.578 --> 02:28:22.279]  Because it's all about, on that end, the mainstream message is about controlling the message.
[02:28:22.459 --> 02:28:23.900]  You're not trying to control the message.
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:25.620]  You're simply putting the message out there
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:29.843]  You're right, and they sell it like, oh, because we want it to look really good and have high standards.
[02:28:29.863 --> 02:28:36.188]  The truth is, they want everybody under control, and then the CBS Broadcast Center sends the teleprompter text down.
[02:28:36.468 --> 02:28:38.790]  They give you a video package sent from Manhattan.
[02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:43.093]  You read over it locally, and people think it's the local anchor they trust.
[02:28:43.514 --> 02:28:46.576]  Really, it's a technocrat writing it in Manhattan.
[02:28:46.696 --> 02:28:54.060]  Yeah, or some individual business that does nothing but write consumer stories for you and they send them out to 15 stations and everybody takes them.
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:55.801]  Hey, Mercury's good for your baby!
[02:28:56.161 --> 02:28:57.902]  And re-voices them, and that's the key, right?
[02:28:58.142 --> 02:29:02.764]  It's the anchor's voice, so it has the legitimacy, but it's the same script going out to every place.
[02:29:02.804 --> 02:29:03.665]  It makes them repeaters.
[02:29:04.265 --> 02:29:04.885]  They are repeaters.
[02:29:04.925 --> 02:29:10.986]  But now what you've done successfully launching your own media platform and others are doing, I mean, this is the death knell.
[02:29:11.126 --> 02:29:16.027]  I don't think they can come out with taxes, regulations, net IDs, Internet neutrality.
[02:29:16.427 --> 02:29:18.587]  I don't think they can put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[02:29:18.788 --> 02:29:25.469]  Yeah, I think the challenge for them is going to be to stay relevant because even if new media didn't exist, I mean, they're still irrelevant, right?
[02:29:25.509 --> 02:29:30.890]  If you cut rid of all the new media in one fell swoop, that doesn't suddenly make you more legitimate.
[02:29:31.210 --> 02:29:33.090]  And so folks still won't watch Piers Morgan.
[02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:33.870]  That's right.
[02:29:33.890 --> 02:29:34.010]  Right.
[02:29:58.735 --> 02:30:01.736]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.656 --> 02:30:05.477]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.518 --> 02:30:11.179]  Introducing Pro One.

[02:31:12.492 --> 02:31:17.337]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:31:17.517 --> 02:31:24.704]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:31:24.824 --> 02:31:30.229]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[02:32:07.218 --> 02:32:08.039]  Infowarshop.com
[02:32:09.540 --> 02:32:12.882]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:32:12.982 --> 02:32:15.244]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:32:15.404 --> 02:32:23.709]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:32:24.009 --> 02:32:34.195]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.

[02:33:24.499 --> 02:33:25.899]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:36.034]  The so-called presidential kill list has gotten a lot of attention, and this list of folks who have been targeted for assassination, and on that list have been U.S.
[02:33:36.074 --> 02:33:38.895]  citizens who have not been afforded trial, including Anwar al-Awlaki.
[02:33:39.615 --> 02:33:46.699]  How do you, as president, or any president for that matter, regardless of party or person, utilize that power to assassinate even U.S.
[02:33:46.719 --> 02:33:47.099]  citizens?
[02:33:47.179 --> 02:33:58.425]  Well, first of all, you're basing this on reports in the news that have never been confirmed by me, and I don't talk about our national security decisions in that way.
[02:33:58.925 --> 02:33:59.686]  Well, what an answer.
[02:33:59.986 --> 02:34:03.308]  The president won't confirm that list, but he won't deny the list.
[02:34:03.789 --> 02:34:05.310]  Okay, but let's add another layer here.
[02:34:05.390 --> 02:34:10.834]  Because that presidential kill list, it didn't just get out because of hard-nosed journalists breaking the story.
[02:34:11.274 --> 02:34:13.175]  It was leaked by the administration.
[02:34:13.816 --> 02:34:18.860]  In that two-shot, I nodded my head when the president said that he hadn't confirmed these reports.
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:20.260]  And that's true.
[02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:21.461]  So who has?
[02:34:22.001 --> 02:34:33.965]  Well, to the New York Times, William Daley, President Obama's Chief of Staff in 2011, talked openly about this kill list, saying the administration knew they couldn't simply just go on adding more names indefinitely.
[02:34:34.545 --> 02:34:42.047]  Dennis Blair, the Director of National Intelligence... Alright, that's Ben Swan back on his Fox show, getting to question Obama, and of course that was a few years ago.
[02:34:42.968 --> 02:34:46.229]  Now he openly brags about it and says, I'm really good at killing people, so...
[02:34:47.209 --> 02:34:51.310]  This is the attempt of, like, denying that the ocean has fish in it or something.
[02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:57.531]  This is the level of, hey, you can keep your doctor, it'll cut your premium, you can't keep your doctor, it'll increase your premium.
[02:34:58.812 --> 02:35:08.394]  It's this arrogance of lying, and it's getting worse, because they don't get in trouble now, even though Congress has a 6% approval rating, 10 at the highest, they just
[02:35:08.954 --> 02:35:09.836]  So it's a paradox.
[02:35:09.856 --> 02:35:13.183]  Everybody knows they're liars, but they just continue on.
[02:35:13.203 --> 02:35:16.891]  Ben Swann, looking at this, how is this the Peace Prize winner?
[02:35:17.605 --> 02:35:18.606]  Well, that's a great question.
[02:35:18.626 --> 02:35:21.909]  I mean, he doesn't deserve a Peace Prize, but he never deserved it in the first place.
[02:35:21.929 --> 02:35:26.192]  I mean, you gave him the Peace Prize when he'd only been around for, you know, a very short amount of time.
[02:35:26.252 --> 02:35:31.757]  I mean, what we're talking about, he'd barely gotten into the White House and he already had a Peace Prize around his neck.
[02:35:32.398 --> 02:35:38.263]  And it wasn't based upon anything he had done, but I don't think it matters because that's all a political game, right?
[02:35:38.323 --> 02:35:42.286]  It's about, he's the guy we like, and when he kills people, it's okay, they must be bad people.
[02:35:42.306 --> 02:35:45.469]  When Bush does it, then, no, he's a war criminal.
[02:35:45.509 --> 02:35:47.029]  Yeah, but it's trendy when Obama does it.
[02:35:47.049 --> 02:35:47.350]  That's right.
[02:35:47.390 --> 02:35:48.450]  It's cool to do it when it's Obama.
[02:35:48.490 --> 02:35:49.670]  Because he shoots hoops and, you know.
[02:35:49.830 --> 02:35:50.030]  Yeah.
[02:35:50.350 --> 02:35:51.951]  I mean, that's the mentality.
[02:35:51.971 --> 02:36:01.053]  And that's what's really, I think, embarrassing for media in the United States, is this double standard where they do not hold this president accountable to anyone or anything.
[02:36:01.293 --> 02:36:03.834]  Well, the word is Jay Leno did those jokes about Obama and stuff.
[02:36:03.854 --> 02:36:05.295]  That's why he was taken out.
[02:36:05.735 --> 02:36:07.815]  And now the guy that replaced him, his ratings are falling.
[02:36:08.295 --> 02:36:09.856]  And that takes us back to Piers Morgan.
[02:36:09.876 --> 02:36:11.436]  You were talking about him during the break.
[02:36:11.816 --> 02:36:13.337]  What is your take on that whole phenomenon?
[02:36:13.817 --> 02:36:15.398]  Well, I think, first of all, you made a great point.
[02:36:15.698 --> 02:36:21.961]  When Piers Morgan came in, he was billed as being this phenom who was showing up from Great Britain.
[02:36:22.001 --> 02:36:23.222]  He was a brilliant journalist.
[02:36:23.262 --> 02:36:26.883]  He was a great interviewer because apparently he made some prime minister cry at some point.
[02:36:27.083 --> 02:36:28.644]  Well, Barbara Walters does the same thing.
[02:36:28.684 --> 02:36:31.425]  We don't call her a great hard-nosed journalist.
[02:36:32.226 --> 02:36:34.067]  And yet, you know, here's Piers Morgan.
[02:36:34.127 --> 02:36:37.628]  He shows up on air and his show was, it fell flat from day one.
[02:36:37.848 --> 02:36:40.750]  His highest moment, really, in his entire time was with you.
[02:36:40.770 --> 02:36:42.611]  I mean, when you were on his show and you,
[02:36:43.251 --> 02:36:44.391]  Basically lambasted him.
[02:36:45.192 --> 02:36:47.372]  That was that was Piers Morgan's moment.
[02:36:47.392 --> 02:36:50.253]  That aired on basically every news show in the West, Japan.
[02:36:50.353 --> 02:36:57.496]  It aired on every comedy show from Comedy Central and The Colbert Report and Stewart right through to Jay Leno.
[02:36:57.956 --> 02:37:02.117]  It was seen by probably a billion people and it was a dead cat bounce for him.
[02:37:02.178 --> 02:37:09.060]  His ratings went up for a while but went right back down because it discredited him and they're always telling us be nice, don't stick your head up,
[02:37:09.860 --> 02:37:11.882]  You know, don't get noticed, that's how you win in politics.
[02:37:11.922 --> 02:37:12.963]  But then they're vicious.
[02:37:13.384 --> 02:37:17.267]  They want us to stand down and not be aggressive, so they can be aggressive and take over.
[02:37:17.547 --> 02:37:21.571]  I think the moral there is, Paul Revere rode around saying get weapons and kill people.
[02:37:22.011 --> 02:37:22.812]  I'm not saying that.
[02:37:23.012 --> 02:37:25.515]  I'm raising my voice saying, look, you're here to take our guns.
[02:37:25.895 --> 02:37:27.416]  It's going to start a civil war if you do.
[02:37:28.237 --> 02:37:29.478]  And Piers Morgan knows that.
[02:37:29.538 --> 02:37:30.158]  Everybody knows that.
[02:37:30.479 --> 02:37:31.479]  Stop mincing words.
[02:37:31.539 --> 02:37:38.484]  Stop letting them set the parameters of the debate where I have then a fake debate with him so I'll be invited back on his show.
[02:37:38.945 --> 02:37:44.409]  I'd rather blow his show up politically with a political hand grenade of truth and be done with him.
[02:37:45.109 --> 02:37:51.510]  Well look, and remember, whenever anybody talks about that interview, they always say, did you see Alex Jones on Piers Morgan?
[02:37:52.050 --> 02:37:54.211]  Not, did you see Piers Morgan interview Alex Jones?
[02:37:54.791 --> 02:37:57.531]  And the difference is, is that people are saying, did you see Alex Jones?
[02:37:57.751 --> 02:37:59.091]  What he had to say, how he said it.
[02:37:59.592 --> 02:38:01.692]  Piers was just, he just happened to be there.
[02:38:01.792 --> 02:38:03.952]  He was a casualty, he was a sideshow.
[02:38:04.532 --> 02:38:05.793]  And so there was nothing to do with him.
[02:38:05.833 --> 02:38:08.213]  And so as you said, look, his ratings were terrible.
[02:38:08.333 --> 02:38:11.154]  That guy has posted some of the worst ratings in CNN's history.
[02:38:11.174 --> 02:38:11.474]  380,000 viewers.
[02:38:11.514 --> 02:38:11.794]  Incredible.
[02:38:13.914 --> 02:38:17.555]  But we're talking about in key demos, 50,000, 48,000 people in key demos.
[02:38:17.575 --> 02:38:18.555]  That's what the advertising is about.
[02:38:18.575 --> 02:38:21.936]  Now, to put that in perspective, my show is only in the top 15 or so.
[02:38:22.577 --> 02:38:25.838]  And it's probably like 14th or something, and Talker says, you know, in the top 25.
[02:38:27.458 --> 02:38:29.579]  Terrestrial Radio, 3 million listeners a day.
[02:38:29.719 --> 02:38:29.859]  Yeah.
[02:38:30.691 --> 02:38:32.472]  I mean, Rush Limbaugh has like 15 million a day.
[02:38:32.612 --> 02:38:33.132]  Right.
[02:38:33.152 --> 02:38:34.813]  Coast to Coast AM, like 6-7 million a day.
[02:38:34.873 --> 02:38:35.854]  Sean Hannity, 10 million a day.
[02:38:37.134 --> 02:38:38.095]  Michael Savage, 10 million a day.
[02:38:38.795 --> 02:38:40.516]  So I'm not up here beating my chest.
[02:38:40.536 --> 02:38:41.216]  Hey, I'm a big guy.
[02:38:41.836 --> 02:38:44.818]  Literally, look at the fanfare, though, around the CNN.
[02:38:44.958 --> 02:38:45.398]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:38:45.498 --> 02:38:49.180]  Around their guy with 380,000 viewers in the entire U.S.
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:51.521]  That's 590 AM in Austin.
[02:38:51.561 --> 02:38:54.223]  I happen to know what I'm on in the morning.
[02:38:55.223 --> 02:38:58.626]  Especially if there's tornadoes or something, has had up to a half million listeners.
[02:38:59.046 --> 02:39:02.809]  Where two million people in total metro, you know, a half million tune in.
[02:39:03.029 --> 02:39:03.189]  Yeah.
[02:39:03.390 --> 02:39:04.871]  Usually it's a couple hundred thousand in the morning.
[02:39:05.031 --> 02:39:05.171]  Yeah.
[02:39:05.291 --> 02:39:07.413]  I mean, it shows how it's a facade, Ben.
[02:39:07.673 --> 02:39:08.233]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:39:08.253 --> 02:39:10.896]  I mean, it's like small market local TV.
[02:39:11.636 --> 02:39:12.437]  Or what his ratings were.
[02:39:13.278 --> 02:39:19.346]  But what's amazing is his ratings were like that for, what, two and a half, three, four years, however long he was on there.
[02:39:19.527 --> 02:39:20.848]  I mean, they kept him in that position.
[02:39:21.029 --> 02:39:22.090]  And it's not just Piers Morgan.
[02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:23.432]  I mean, we're beating up on Piers a little bit.
[02:39:23.492 --> 02:39:24.593]  MSNBC's tanking.
[02:39:24.814 --> 02:39:25.294]  Absolutely.
[02:39:25.395 --> 02:39:26.516]  Or anything on CNN.
[02:39:26.556 --> 02:39:28.218]  Try any program on CNN.
[02:39:28.298 --> 02:39:29.320]  Nobody's watching them.
[02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:38.627]  And so their answer to that is instead of actually covering more news, and instead of responding to what consumers want, it's like, well, let's go out and let's get some reality TV.
[02:39:38.647 --> 02:39:43.210]  Listen, they could stick a local libertarian talk show host on there and get 2 million viewers on that.
[02:39:43.231 --> 02:39:43.571]  They could.
[02:39:43.991 --> 02:39:44.592]  They absolutely could.
[02:39:44.612 --> 02:39:50.456]  I guarantee you, if they stuck you in that slot, you do the investigative reports, that show would have 5 million viewers in a month.
[02:39:50.476 --> 02:39:52.818]  It would, because... You would beat Fox News.
[02:39:53.038 --> 02:39:55.600]  But they won't do it because they want to control the message.
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:40:02.666]  That's right, because it's more important that they not win in ratings or have viewers, it's more important that they say the right things.
[02:40:02.726 --> 02:40:07.510]  It gives them access, then the executives go to parties, and they're connected to the higher-ups.
[02:40:08.210 --> 02:40:08.931]  But I agree with you.
[02:40:09.011 --> 02:40:14.976]  Listen, you could flip CNN in a heartbeat in terms of their ratings if you would just put on some content that people are interested in.
[02:40:14.996 --> 02:40:19.800]  But the people controlling the country are making trillions off keeping us in the dark, so they don't care.
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:23.243]  But then there's the paradox, but you have no viewers, dummy.
[02:40:23.963 --> 02:40:30.307]  So it's a facade that they're in control, but then they realize they are a facade, so why even keep the facade up?
[02:40:30.647 --> 02:40:32.588]  A wind comes by and Piers Morgan blows over.
[02:40:32.788 --> 02:40:33.108]  That's right.
[02:40:33.589 --> 02:40:36.370]  And then they replace him now with probably a cooking show, right?
[02:40:36.390 --> 02:40:38.031]  Because that's where that's where CNN is headed.
[02:40:38.051 --> 02:40:42.934]  I mean, CNN is out actively shopping for reality TV shows in Hollywood right now.
[02:40:42.994 --> 02:40:48.357]  I mean, the talk is they're basically saying to any reality show producer, please show us what you've got.
[02:40:48.757 --> 02:40:49.898]  And they're going to pay big money for it.
[02:40:50.158 --> 02:40:57.304]  They could stick a hillbilly on there, talking about how much he loves Liberty, and it would have 3 or 4 million viewers.
[02:40:57.344 --> 02:40:58.124]  But they won't put that on.
[02:40:58.144 --> 02:41:02.888]  They're going to put on some guy who goes around the country tasting food, because that's their answer.
[02:41:03.669 --> 02:41:11.135]  Listen, and one point that Jeff Zucker makes, who's now running CNN, and he does make this point, in 12 years, the cable news audience has not grown.
[02:41:11.935 --> 02:41:14.737]  And that includes Fox, CNN, MSNBC.
[02:41:14.817 --> 02:41:17.898]  In 12 years there has not been an increase in cable viewership.
[02:41:17.918 --> 02:41:18.979]  They've just moved around.
[02:41:19.459 --> 02:41:20.079]  The viewers have.
[02:41:20.399 --> 02:41:23.641]  And that tells you that something in this formula is not working.
[02:41:24.041 --> 02:41:28.724]  I have satellite and I never watch it unless I want to see a movie that's on or weather.
[02:41:28.744 --> 02:41:34.627]  I mean I go online and I go to benswan.com, I go to drugreport.com, I go to worldnetdaily.com.
[02:41:35.848 --> 02:41:39.491]  That's where you're going to get your news from, and that's what people are doing completely around them.
[02:41:39.611 --> 02:41:43.354]  It's really an incredible thing to watch American media going through this transformation.
[02:41:43.394 --> 02:41:44.655]  It's an exciting transformation.
[02:41:44.675 --> 02:41:45.535]  I think it's a great thing.
[02:41:45.576 --> 02:41:46.336]  It needs to happen.
[02:41:46.776 --> 02:41:51.440]  And it's really only because of the ability that people now have through the internet to be able to access that information.
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:55.944]  A lot of people ask me, you know, why do you have other talk show hosts on your show?
[02:41:56.624 --> 02:42:01.267]  Well, I mean, if I think somebody's doing groundbreaking research and work, it's a war for me.
[02:42:01.407 --> 02:42:02.988]  I want to keep the Second Amendment.
[02:42:03.128 --> 02:42:04.429]  I don't want the state running my kids.
[02:42:04.509 --> 02:42:05.870]  I don't want forced inoculations.
[02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:07.591]  I don't want the country going bankrupt.
[02:42:07.932 --> 02:42:08.492]  I live here.
[02:42:08.652 --> 02:42:09.693]  I'm in this to win it.
[02:42:10.093 --> 02:42:24.443]  And so I just see other people that are eloquent and intelligent fighting as literally other soldiers in this war that absolutely we need to give each other common aid against the enemy because we're going to hang together or hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[02:42:24.463 --> 02:42:26.024]  I mean, this is not a game.
[02:42:26.864 --> 02:42:28.627]  And this is the real deal.
[02:42:29.088 --> 02:42:34.235]  That's why I will not attack any other libertarians or any other conservatives or constitutionalists or free media people.
[02:42:34.816 --> 02:42:37.440]  Even if they attack me now, I will not attack them.
[02:42:38.528 --> 02:42:48.517]  I've never been an infighter but I will not attack them now and I will not respond to attacks because I'm not going to be sitting here later and lose this thing and wish that I wouldn't have been a team player.
[02:42:48.537 --> 02:43:00.328]  We need to have an attitude of working together, building each other up, to amplify each other's audiences, to just absolutely take over the media airwaves and dominate state-run media, discredit it,
[02:43:01.008 --> 02:43:02.790]  And break with the system.
[02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:04.712]  Don't play patty cake with it anymore.
[02:43:04.732 --> 02:43:08.175]  We need to just clearly delineate that we are the media.
[02:43:08.356 --> 02:43:10.258]  We're not as important as the New York Times.
[02:43:10.718 --> 02:43:11.879]  We are not sellouts.
[02:43:12.019 --> 02:43:13.100]  We are the real media.
[02:43:13.601 --> 02:43:15.843]  We're a million times better than the New York Times or CNN.
[02:43:16.704 --> 02:43:17.165]  Absolutely.
[02:43:17.626 --> 02:43:18.246]  No question about it.
[02:43:18.266 --> 02:43:19.028]  And I totally agree with you.
[02:43:19.068 --> 02:43:24.115]  I think it's so important that we do build this synergy between new medias.
[02:43:24.215 --> 02:43:29.943]  And as you said, this, well, look, Roger Ailes has a, over at Fox, he has a policy where he says you never shoot inside the tent.
[02:43:30.424 --> 02:43:31.666]  Even if you disagree with somebody,
[02:43:31.966 --> 02:43:33.266]  Who's there at Fox also?
[02:43:33.306 --> 02:43:34.727]  He says, you just don't shoot inside the tent.
[02:43:34.767 --> 02:43:36.887]  Because there's so much you need to be fighting.
[02:43:37.227 --> 02:43:38.388]  So much you need to be worried about.
[02:43:38.788 --> 02:43:42.389]  The person across from you that you might disagree with on some issue, you never attack them.
[02:43:42.689 --> 02:43:46.150]  I think that same philosophy, and I think, by the way, it's worked very well for Fox.
[02:43:46.530 --> 02:43:50.031]  It's the same philosophy we need in new media, which is, you know, you don't shoot inside the tent.
[02:43:50.051 --> 02:43:52.852]  There's no reason to attack people who are of the same mindset.
[02:43:52.892 --> 02:43:56.673]  What did Cass Sunstein write before he joined the administration for Harvard?
[02:43:56.913 --> 02:43:59.093]  He also wrote it for Chicago Business.
[02:43:59.473 --> 02:44:00.954]  He said, we're going to create fake media.
[02:44:01.474 --> 02:44:05.318]  We're gonna go out like we're the conspiracy theorists, is what people that question their known lies.
[02:44:05.718 --> 02:44:09.422]  Obama's saying you can keep your doctor, or there's a death panel, he calls you a conspiracy theorist.
[02:44:09.442 --> 02:44:09.702]  That's right.
[02:44:09.862 --> 02:44:10.683]  Doesn't matter, we're right.
[02:44:11.003 --> 02:44:14.186]  He just has a throwaway line, intellectually, to not have to deal with us.
[02:44:14.606 --> 02:44:17.109]  He said we're gonna set up media and create infighting.
[02:44:17.509 --> 02:44:19.011]  We'll operate for six months to a year.
[02:44:19.311 --> 02:44:22.335]  That's what George Soros and the Pentagon and the White House are doing now.
[02:44:22.815 --> 02:44:27.881]  They're organizing and creating fake alternative media to immediately start infighting.
[02:44:28.442 --> 02:44:33.708]  So the minute you see that, you're looking, folks, at people that have been paid to do it.
[02:44:34.289 --> 02:44:34.469]  Yep.
[02:44:34.509 --> 02:44:37.571]  So anyone that does that is the enemy.
[02:44:37.951 --> 02:44:39.752]  That's exactly what Media Matters said they would do.
[02:44:40.753 --> 02:44:48.497]  I'm telling you, I'm very suspect of folks at RT that pop up and go, I'm not going to be part of this takeover of Ukraine, you know, I mean, you know, live on air.
[02:44:49.157 --> 02:44:52.119]  Absolutely, you know, you know RT's been infiltrated.
[02:44:52.699 --> 02:44:53.379]  And it's the other way.
[02:44:55.121 --> 02:44:56.382]  Russia infiltrates the US.
[02:44:56.422 --> 02:44:58.924]  It's just look at everybody's agenda, folks.
[02:44:59.224 --> 02:45:05.169]  Look at what they promote and look at the long-term compendium of what people have done.
[02:45:05.189 --> 02:45:07.131]  I'm ranting, go ahead.
[02:45:07.171 --> 02:45:16.999]  No, no, no, listen, and to the point, you're talking about this young lady last night who resigned on the anchor desk over at RT, right, and says I'm not gonna be here anymore.
[02:45:17.039 --> 02:45:20.863]  Well, what I wanted to know was, can you give me some specifics?
[02:45:21.561 --> 02:45:25.502]  When you say that you're not going to be part of a network that's whitewashing for Putin.
[02:45:25.762 --> 02:45:27.842]  Listen, I have all respect if you believe that.
[02:45:28.022 --> 02:45:29.183]  So can you tell me what's happening?
[02:45:29.843 --> 02:45:30.783]  Tell me about the whitewashing.
[02:45:30.803 --> 02:45:31.743]  Give me some examples of it.
[02:45:31.903 --> 02:45:33.624]  Which she didn't do when she stepped down.
[02:45:33.644 --> 02:45:36.304]  She just said, I'm not going to be a part of this whitewashing and I'm out of here.
[02:45:36.644 --> 02:45:37.124]  And she left.
[02:45:37.965 --> 02:45:41.445]  If that's her conscience, if that's her conviction, that's fine.
[02:45:41.465 --> 02:45:42.886]  But I'd like to know some details on it.
[02:45:43.286 --> 02:45:45.186]  And I'd like to know specific- I have an interview by her.
[02:45:46.466 --> 02:45:47.987]  And I'm not accusing her of being an operative.
[02:45:48.007 --> 02:45:49.167]  I'm just saying it needs to be looked into.
[02:45:49.924 --> 02:46:03.110]  Because I know for a fact, and I can talk about this but it just sounds unbelievable, the White House got in touch with RT two years ago and said do not have him back on anymore if you want to keep your license in this country.
[02:46:03.635 --> 02:46:03.915]  Really?
[02:46:04.195 --> 02:46:05.156]  Oh yeah, that's what I was told.
[02:46:05.196 --> 02:46:06.777]  And they never had me back on, which I don't even care about.
[02:46:06.797 --> 02:46:12.921]  I mean, I think when I've been on with Max Keiser, that can still get on and still air, but he has to go through a bunch of trouble to get me on.
[02:46:12.941 --> 02:46:16.324]  I don't even care, because RT domestically doesn't have a very big audience.
[02:46:16.364 --> 02:46:17.164]  Worldwide it's big.
[02:46:17.545 --> 02:46:21.547]  Plus, people would say, normally I'm not selling anything worldwide, so why would I want to go on RT?
[02:46:21.908 --> 02:46:23.509]  Well, I want to go on RT to sell freedom.
[02:46:24.029 --> 02:46:24.990]  To sell the idea of liberty.
[02:46:25.530 --> 02:46:26.430]  Uh, but they didn't like me.
[02:46:26.470 --> 02:46:28.611]  I would always go in there and talk bad about Stalin and Lenin and stuff.
[02:46:28.851 --> 02:46:34.572]  And even though Russia doesn't go that direction of Stalin and Lenin now, still, it's kind of like, hey, don't insult our background.
[02:46:34.592 --> 02:46:35.752]  You're messing with the archetypes.
[02:46:36.292 --> 02:46:36.552]  Yeah.
[02:46:36.652 --> 02:46:36.832]  Right.
[02:46:36.872 --> 02:46:37.333]  Exactly.
[02:46:37.373 --> 02:46:38.313]  Messing with the archetypes.
[02:46:38.373 --> 02:46:43.654]  But, uh, you know, I mean, I've been on Japanese TV, British TV, Iranian TV.
[02:46:43.974 --> 02:46:46.154]  The media always is like, what, do you work for the Iranians?
[02:46:46.214 --> 02:46:46.395]  No.
[02:46:46.715 --> 02:46:48.155]  I like to go talk to the Iranians.
[02:46:48.715 --> 02:46:49.756]  Well, and why shouldn't you?
[02:46:49.796 --> 02:46:57.041]  I mean, we have this policy in this country where we don't want to talk to anyone, we don't want to share our ideals, we don't want to have dialogue and conversation.
[02:47:18.775 --> 02:47:19.956]  Yeah, and that's what it is.
[02:47:20.637 --> 02:47:24.301]  If you want to be a part of what we're doing, you can't be a part of what they're doing.
[02:47:24.541 --> 02:47:30.707]  It's like the cool kids table at high school, and they want to decide where you're going to sit and who you're going to be talking to.
[02:47:30.727 --> 02:47:31.989]  Yeah, I wasn't at the cool kids table.
[02:47:32.109 --> 02:47:34.151]  I was behind the rec building with the cheerleader.
[02:47:35.512 --> 02:47:36.493]  I'm on my lunch break.
[02:47:36.553 --> 02:47:37.874]  I mean, I'm just going to be honest here.
[02:47:37.894 --> 02:47:41.657]  In a similar way, that's still what's happening with new media, right?
[02:47:41.998 --> 02:47:45.441]  Instead of sitting inside the lunchroom, you're out behind the bleachers.
[02:47:45.461 --> 02:47:48.243]  But the point is that that's the game that's being played.
[02:47:48.263 --> 02:47:49.064]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:47:49.084 --> 02:47:53.688]  It's about creating this image of we are the elite in media.
[02:47:53.808 --> 02:47:56.230]  And so nobody can be anywhere near where we are.
[02:47:56.530 --> 02:47:59.073]  And as you said, it still goes back to the fact that nobody's watching.
[02:47:59.713 --> 02:48:03.575]  I mean, how can you consider yourself elite when you have no viewership?
[02:48:03.955 --> 02:48:08.357]  When you get more viewers on the clip on YouTube than you do on your own program.
[02:48:09.417 --> 02:48:10.358]  It should be embarrassing.
[02:48:10.418 --> 02:48:14.840]  So it's interesting to watch how right now media does not have an answer to that and they don't have an answer to it.
[02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:20.563]  I gotta tell you, I've talked to a lot of very high level executives about direction, what they're doing, where they're heading.
[02:48:20.843 --> 02:48:21.843]  And you know what the response is?
[02:48:22.744 --> 02:48:24.705]  By the time we crash, we'll be retired.
[02:48:24.725 --> 02:48:25.465]  It won't be our problem.
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:27.241]  That's really the thinking.
[02:48:27.381 --> 02:48:33.988]  That's the attitude of the establishment is, your show's going to get really big, Jones, but America's going to basically collapse, and it won't matter.
[02:48:34.008 --> 02:48:36.050]  I mean, that is a loser attitude.
[02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:37.010]  They don't even care.
[02:48:37.291 --> 02:48:39.313]  They want to just keep riding out and making their money.
[02:48:39.553 --> 02:48:41.315]  That's why they don't care about the decisions they're making.
[02:48:41.826 --> 02:48:42.506]  Yeah, no they don't.
[02:48:42.606 --> 02:48:46.267]  Because ultimately they're like, it's not going to be my problem, let it be somebody else's problem.
[02:48:47.387 --> 02:48:49.928]  Because right now, it's like, we're not going to mess with the status quo.
[02:48:50.028 --> 02:48:50.788]  We're just not going to mess with it.
[02:48:50.808 --> 02:48:55.289]  That's because the executives of the subsidiaries want the status quo.
[02:48:55.309 --> 02:48:55.609]  That's right.
[02:48:55.810 --> 02:48:56.130]  That's right.
[02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:57.190]  And so they're not going to change it.
[02:48:57.210 --> 02:49:03.992]  And so if people expect that CNN is going to make some drastic change, that MSNBC will make some drastic change, it's not going to happen.
[02:49:04.012 --> 02:49:04.852]  No, it's a facade.
[02:49:05.252 --> 02:49:05.312]  No.
[02:49:06.426 --> 02:49:16.414]  They will shut CNN off before they would make a change and put a pro-liberty broadcast on because they're part of the occupying globalist media.
[02:49:16.454 --> 02:49:17.155]  That's not rhetoric.
[02:49:17.175 --> 02:49:17.976]  They are occupiers.
[02:49:18.116 --> 02:49:19.137]  No, they absolutely are.
[02:49:19.157 --> 02:49:24.021]  And the goal on their end, again, as we've talked about, is really about controlling message.
[02:49:24.261 --> 02:49:25.482]  I mean, just think about this.
[02:49:26.613 --> 02:49:29.574]  When we talk about things like cryptocurrencies, you know, Bitcoin.
[02:49:29.614 --> 02:49:32.575]  When we talk about things like, you know, individual freedom.
[02:49:32.615 --> 02:49:35.076]  When we talk about, you know, nullification.
[02:49:35.496 --> 02:49:38.317]  I mean, how many newscasts around the country even know those terms?
[02:49:38.617 --> 02:49:42.439]  But we're popularizing them, and even though those are all messy things, they're real change.
[02:49:42.539 --> 02:49:43.059]  Exactly.
[02:49:43.459 --> 02:49:47.221]  And through the crises, through the struggle, we will develop better forms of it.
[02:49:47.461 --> 02:49:47.821]  That's right.
[02:49:48.101 --> 02:49:49.782]  And to what you said, look, that's
[02:49:50.862 --> 02:49:51.903]  They're all forms of change.
[02:49:51.983 --> 02:49:53.424]  We're watching the change happen.
[02:49:53.704 --> 02:49:55.225]  And people are excited about those issues.
[02:49:55.245 --> 02:49:57.326]  They're talking about those issues every single day.
[02:49:57.587 --> 02:50:03.851]  But they're having those conversations either on social media sites, they're having them around their kitchen tables, they're having them around the wall.
[02:50:03.891 --> 02:50:04.731]  That's right.
[02:50:04.751 --> 02:50:07.874]  CNN and they all wonder why they're dying and why Fox isn't growing.
[02:50:08.294 --> 02:50:12.417]  It's because you don't ever get out the same tried little rut you're in.
[02:50:12.457 --> 02:50:14.038]  You just do the same thing over and over again.
[02:50:14.058 --> 02:50:14.578]  It's predictable.
[02:50:14.678 --> 02:50:15.999]  It's entirely predictable.
[02:50:16.019 --> 02:50:17.240]  I mean, think about the fact that
[02:50:18.041 --> 02:50:21.705]  30, 40 years ago, you could turn on a newscast and you only had ABC, NBC and CBS, right?
[02:50:22.066 --> 02:50:24.028]  And it was the same basic stories every single night.
[02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:27.813]  Well, here we are 40 years later, it's still the same basic stories every single night.
[02:50:27.873 --> 02:50:29.255]  That's what's incredible about it.
[02:50:29.475 --> 02:50:34.121]  What's so remarkable is that they are the exact same stories every day.
[02:50:34.241 --> 02:50:35.282]  It's completely predictable.
[02:50:35.502 --> 02:50:36.183]  In the same order.
[02:50:36.403 --> 02:50:37.043]  In the same order.
[02:50:37.063 --> 02:50:38.004]  With the same advertisers.
[02:50:38.024 --> 02:50:38.864]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:38.905 --> 02:50:40.366]  And there's no question.
[02:50:40.606 --> 02:50:42.367]  Look, you talk a lot about vaccines.
[02:50:42.387 --> 02:50:43.648]  You talk about those issues.
[02:50:43.688 --> 02:50:47.931]  We did a piece during our Truth in Media season last year talking about just vaccine court.
[02:50:48.671 --> 02:50:51.713]  Now that's not very... Let's talk about that when we come back and do five minutes of Overdrive.
[02:50:52.074 --> 02:51:01.040]  And if you're not too tired, or if you don't have to go, you may have to, you're welcome to do the nightly news with us tonight or tape something so you can kind of, you know, break down whatever subjects you want.

[02:52:03.054 --> 02:52:06.718]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.

[02:53:09.158 --> 02:53:09.558]  Hi there.
[02:53:10.159 --> 02:53:11.219]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:14.902]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:53:15.502 --> 02:53:24.288]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:53:24.668 --> 02:53:30.692]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:53:31.373 --> 02:53:32.954]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:53:33.554 --> 02:53:38.638]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:53:39.358 --> 02:53:46.444]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:53:47.305 --> 02:53:52.209]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:53:52.890 --> 02:53:58.774]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:53:59.395 --> 02:54:04.719]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:06.241]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:54:18.458 --> 02:54:31.629]  Obama had just signed an executive order to start sanctions against different Russian officials and not let them travel to Western-controlled countries.
[02:54:31.649 --> 02:54:33.030]  This is getting really serious.
[02:54:34.451 --> 02:54:38.334]  We'll be covering it all on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:54:38.454 --> 02:54:42.157]  Ben Swann's going to be on the Nightly News with us, with David Knight.
[02:54:42.177 --> 02:54:44.159]  Maybe do an expanded interview.
[02:54:45.694 --> 02:54:51.607]  We've got so much news I haven't gotten to yet, but truly we're living in an authoritarian system.
[02:54:53.049 --> 02:54:54.910]  Ben, I've thrown out so many points here.
[02:54:55.150 --> 02:54:56.651]  What else is on your radar screen?
[02:54:56.671 --> 02:55:00.172]  I could ask questions all day, but what else do you want to impart to the audience?
[02:55:00.613 --> 02:55:03.094]  Well, one of the things that we're working on right now is this.
[02:55:03.414 --> 02:55:05.715]  First of all, we're launching our season two of Truth in Media Project.
[02:55:06.255 --> 02:55:08.576]  We released an episode today, and I'd encourage people to check it out.
[02:55:08.596 --> 02:55:20.302]  But basically, it's taking on this political primary system in America, because we have this system right now that's essentially set up where about half the voters in the country are in a position right now where they cannot
[02:55:20.902 --> 02:55:21.362]  They cannot.
[02:55:21.382 --> 02:55:21.943]  We got pop-ups.
[02:55:21.963 --> 02:55:23.644]  Sorry about that.
[02:55:23.664 --> 02:55:30.370]  Basically, what they do right now is they cannot vote in a primary unless they are registered as a Republican or a Democrat.
[02:55:30.410 --> 02:55:39.037]  But about half the country is no longer affiliated with either party, and yet voters have to pay $400 million a year to pay for those primaries.
[02:55:41.059 --> 02:55:51.787]  Is continuing to only try to prop up the two parties and give them attention, while trying to stop the Tea Party from actually taking over the Republicans, so we have a second party.
[02:55:51.867 --> 02:55:52.107]  That's right.
[02:55:52.127 --> 02:55:52.968]  We don't even really have two.
[02:55:53.068 --> 02:55:55.810]  No, we have one party that has two wings on it, right?
[02:55:55.850 --> 02:55:58.112]  It has a right wing and a left wing, but it's the same party.
[02:55:58.352 --> 02:55:59.153]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:55:59.213 --> 02:56:01.294]  I mean, think about those numbers.
[02:56:01.574 --> 02:56:02.995]  50% of the country is no longer affiliated.
[02:56:03.256 --> 02:56:06.198]  If you watch any national newscast, you would never believe that.
[02:56:06.738 --> 02:56:15.881]  If you watch that, you would believe the country is equally divided between Democrats and Republicans, and there's this cosmic arm-wrestling match between the two to see who's going to get just enough leverage to win the next election.
[02:56:15.901 --> 02:56:18.901]  Does the illusion continue to fall slowly, or could it collapse?
[02:56:19.101 --> 02:56:19.942]  I think it'll collapse.
[02:56:20.202 --> 02:56:20.442]  I do.
[02:56:20.522 --> 02:56:22.742]  I think it's a generational fall, too.
[02:56:23.102 --> 02:56:32.585]  I think by the next two elections that we have, I think 2016 presidential, 2016, and then when we go to 2020, I think you're going to see significant shifts in terms of the way the electorate does vote.
[02:56:32.625 --> 02:56:33.285]  And they know that.
[02:56:33.386 --> 02:56:35.067]  The Pentagon and their own prospectuses say that.
[02:56:35.087 --> 02:56:37.788]  That's why they're setting up Homeland Security checkpoints, tanks.
[02:56:38.149 --> 02:56:40.510]  They're going, look, you're not getting out of this voting, boys.
[02:56:41.111 --> 02:56:44.393]  And that's the problem, is they're planning an authoritarian takeover.
[02:56:44.453 --> 02:56:45.493]  What's your take on all that?
[02:56:45.994 --> 02:56:47.535]  The billions of bullets, the checkpoints?
[02:56:47.635 --> 02:56:48.355]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:56:48.395 --> 02:56:49.636]  Listen, we did a piece recently.
[02:56:49.656 --> 02:56:56.821]  I know you guys over at InfoWars broke that story originally about all that stockpiling of ammo, which, by the way, was incredible work that you guys did.
[02:56:57.401 --> 02:56:57.981]  That was important.
[02:56:58.021 --> 02:57:00.162]  No, it was very important, and it was way ahead of the curve.
[02:57:00.182 --> 02:57:05.864]  What was interesting to me as a media guy is that it took about a year and a half for everybody else to even cover it.
[02:57:05.904 --> 02:57:07.485]  Oh, at first they said it didn't exist.
[02:57:07.545 --> 02:57:07.825]  Right.
[02:57:09.125 --> 02:57:10.786]  Yeah, it was a fake story.
[02:57:10.806 --> 02:57:11.586]  It was a made-up story.
[02:57:11.626 --> 02:57:13.087]  They had AP come out and say it wasn't real.
[02:57:13.167 --> 02:57:15.187]  Yeah, and then they come back and say, oh, well, maybe it is real.
[02:57:15.207 --> 02:57:16.868]  Well, then it turns out, oh, in fact, it is.
[02:57:17.128 --> 02:57:19.989]  Well, then comes the big question, which they never bother to ask.
[02:57:20.409 --> 02:57:22.050]  Why is the Post Office stockpiling bullets?
[02:57:22.510 --> 02:57:24.671]  Why is Social Security Administration stockpiling ammo?
[02:57:25.271 --> 02:57:31.979]  Why are we, especially right now, at a time where we have the 17 trillion dollar debt, as taxpayers, let's just make it a fiscal issue.
[02:57:31.999 --> 02:57:32.960]  Let's forget about everything else.
[02:57:32.981 --> 02:57:34.242]  Let's make it just a fiscal issue.
[02:57:34.582 --> 02:57:39.408]  Why are we paying for postal workers to be carrying around that much ammo?
[02:57:39.608 --> 02:57:40.449]  Or to be trained that way?
[02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:45.411]  Well, I mean, it's now two and a half billion rounds of ammo, enough to fight a 30-plus year Iraq war.
[02:57:45.431 --> 02:57:48.772]  When it was 1.6, it was like a 27-year war in Iraq.
[02:57:49.252 --> 02:57:54.474]  And then they're training for riot control, they're training in all the manuals to fight the Tea Party, the only opposition.
[02:57:55.074 --> 02:57:58.595]  Libertarians, I mean, they see that half the country calls themselves libertarians.
[02:57:58.875 --> 02:58:00.135]  They see we're taking over.
[02:58:00.355 --> 02:58:02.756]  They're preparing military operations for us.
[02:58:03.036 --> 02:58:10.018]  But if they can never have that debate, if they can just deny it, then we can't debate it and get the moral high ground and point out how they're treacherous.
[02:58:10.278 --> 02:58:11.498]  So instead, they just want to deny it.
[02:58:12.159 --> 02:58:16.940]  See, that's why we have to continue to force the admission that it's real so we can then discredit it.
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:17.420]  Right.
[02:58:17.460 --> 02:58:18.120]  Well, absolutely.
[02:58:18.140 --> 02:58:24.942]  And when you have this militarization of police going on around the country, it's just incredible to watch that happen.
[02:58:25.842 --> 02:58:28.343]  The buildup, I mean, folks have to wake up and pay attention.
[02:58:29.554 --> 02:58:34.116]  We're going to come back and I want to ask you about the Second Amendment, where you see that fight going, a little five-minute piece.
[02:58:34.156 --> 02:58:36.137]  And then that's it until tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:36.177 --> 02:58:38.018]  Central, with the main transmission.
[02:58:38.498 --> 02:58:41.439]  And some stations don't carry this extra time that's coming up.
[02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:47.642]  You can always find us online at infowars.com forward slash show for the free audio, video feeds and the podcast.
[02:58:47.662 --> 02:58:48.282]  Stay with us.
[02:58:48.443 --> 02:58:49.263]  Overdrive coming up.
[02:58:49.583 --> 02:58:51.084]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:58:51.644 --> 02:58:52.284]  Spread the word.
[02:58:52.304 --> 02:58:53.905]  Support our local A&M & FM affiliates.
[02:58:54.025 --> 02:58:54.245]  That's key.
[02:58:59.175 --> 02:59:09.559]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:59:09.859 --> 02:59:11.720]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:12.601]  Fluoride!
[02:59:12.801 --> 02:59:14.381]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:59:14.721 --> 02:59:21.044]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:59:21.284 --> 02:59:26.089]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:59:26.209 --> 02:59:32.316]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:59:32.536 --> 02:59:34.718]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:59:34.958 --> 02:59:37.581]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:59:37.901 --> 02:59:41.285]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:59:41.385 --> 02:59:46.609]  You'll find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:46.809 --> 02:59:51.633]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[03:00:01.802 --> 03:00:03.203]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.843 --> 03:00:07.066]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.249 --> 03:00:14.870]  Big Brother.
[03:00:15.551 --> 03:00:16.572]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:17.313 --> 03:00:18.414]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:19.075 --> 03:00:19.896]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.676 --> 03:00:21.597]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.218 --> 03:00:25.822]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.403 --> 03:00:30.468]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.463 --> 03:00:33.684]  Ben Swan's in the studio with us.
[03:00:33.704 --> 03:00:34.825]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.506 --> 03:00:37.968]  I want to talk about the Second Amendment, something that dovetails with that.
[03:00:38.328 --> 03:00:57.322]  Bloomberg, with his mayors against people defending themselves, or illegal guns as he calls it, and Moms Demand Action, all five of them, they have gone to Facebook and are saying they're going to put it in with porn, not let people under 18 see any type of pro-gun comments, not let gun shops have online sites pushing them back to their legal gun shops.
[03:00:57.342 --> 03:00:57.622]  That's right.
[03:00:57.822 --> 03:01:00.024]  This is a real form of censorship we see.
[03:01:00.324 --> 03:01:04.266]  What's your take on that and other ways they're gonna try to curtail our liberty?
[03:01:28.242 --> 03:01:33.905]  It's actually a pretty smart propaganda campaign by the leftists and the globalists who want to take away those guns.
[03:01:34.346 --> 03:01:42.530]  But consider this, what Facebook has done is they've allowed us to depend on them and we've built a whole lot of property on Facebook's real estate.
[03:01:42.870 --> 03:01:50.277]  And I think what's got to happen next is that there's going to have to be a movement to walk away from that social media site, whether it's the emergence of a new one or whatever it might be.
[03:01:50.757 --> 03:01:54.381]  I think Liberty folks, pro-Second Amendment folks, there are enough of them out there.
[03:01:54.421 --> 03:01:57.443]  You could overnight, overnight, you could build a new social network.
[03:01:57.463 --> 03:01:58.124]  No, no, I agree.
[03:01:58.144 --> 03:02:00.907]  We have PlanetInfoWars.com, but it's kind of a basic system.
[03:02:00.927 --> 03:02:01.627]  People use that.
[03:02:01.647 --> 03:02:04.150]  It's PlanetInfoWars.com, but the problem is
[03:02:04.990 --> 03:02:07.051]  I get that, but it had major media support.
[03:02:07.071 --> 03:02:10.251]  They built it into billions of people visiting and hundreds of millions on it.
[03:02:10.871 --> 03:02:13.832]  YouTube, Facebook, even though they censor, that's where the fight is.
[03:02:14.432 --> 03:02:19.913]  So yeah, I think we should build new alternatives while still going in there and dominating the memes.
[03:02:19.973 --> 03:02:22.174]  They don't want us in there because we're winning.
[03:02:22.534 --> 03:02:26.435]  They have to shut down our free speech because we're kicking Bloomberg's butt.
[03:02:26.695 --> 03:02:27.715]  Well, but I also think this.
[03:02:27.795 --> 03:02:29.336]  I think that Facebook's dying anyways.
[03:02:29.616 --> 03:02:30.176]  Oh yeah.
[03:02:30.496 --> 03:02:31.316]  It's a pump and dump.
[03:02:31.516 --> 03:02:32.357]  Yeah, it really is.
[03:02:32.377 --> 03:02:38.842]  I mean, they blew up, they did this big IPO, which was kind of a failure as they got it launched.
[03:02:39.603 --> 03:02:41.524]  But Facebook, it's done already.
[03:02:41.544 --> 03:02:42.665]  I mean, people are moving away from it.
[03:02:42.705 --> 03:02:45.388]  That's another generational thing, where they've already started shifting away.
[03:02:45.688 --> 03:02:49.251]  So I think everything that Facebook is doing now is just a nail in its own coffin.
[03:02:50.444 --> 03:02:52.525]  And again, it's like CNN nails it in its own coffin.
[03:02:52.565 --> 03:02:53.686]  They can't help it.
[03:02:53.706 --> 03:02:59.068]  It's like Reddit has these, you know, we like to discuss censorship, but we censor the discussions of censorship.
[03:02:59.468 --> 03:03:04.651]  Reddit, Dig, all those, we used to dominate those, and they just banned our articles being on there.
[03:03:06.792 --> 03:03:10.234]  They have a little default that their supermods have, where they just kill it.
[03:03:11.314 --> 03:03:11.874]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:03:11.894 --> 03:03:13.235]  You're voting for it to be upvoted.
[03:03:13.275 --> 03:03:14.076]  No, no, it's rigged.
[03:03:14.316 --> 03:03:17.358]  Well, because it's the appearance of free speech.
[03:03:17.818 --> 03:03:19.459]  It's the appearance of liberty.
[03:03:19.499 --> 03:03:23.642]  It's the appearance that you're going to have a say, but you don't actually have one.
[03:03:23.682 --> 03:03:26.284]  And people argue, well, why does your comment censor stuff?
[03:03:26.604 --> 03:03:31.367]  Well, if you say we're going to kill the president or something, there's automatic bots and stuff or spam that block it.
[03:03:31.387 --> 03:03:32.168]  We're not even on there.
[03:03:32.208 --> 03:03:33.289]  It's Discus that does it.
[03:03:33.929 --> 03:03:34.710]  That way it's third party.
[03:03:34.730 --> 03:03:35.570]  I have no liability.
[03:03:35.590 --> 03:03:39.913]  Believe me, I had plenty of trouble running our own comments and our own message boards and things.
[03:03:41.474 --> 03:03:44.716]  We're not censoring, but it's also our site.
[03:03:45.237 --> 03:03:51.961]  But a site that advertises, posts your articles, and people can upvote it, and then you cheat the voting process, that's true censorship.
[03:03:52.141 --> 03:03:54.243]  Yeah, no, it is true censorship.
[03:03:54.523 --> 03:03:58.566]  And especially when you say, look, there are certain subjects that we don't want you to discuss.
[03:03:58.986 --> 03:04:03.370]  So there's a difference between saying, hey, listen, we want to have civil debate conversation here.
[03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:07.634]  We don't want you to attack people and say horrible things about them on a personal level.
[03:04:08.254 --> 03:04:12.198]  That's different than saying this is a subject that you're not allowed to discuss.
[03:04:12.218 --> 03:04:16.561]  Well, they won't let us post an article about how they make students and teachers take part in shooting drills.
[03:04:17.362 --> 03:04:18.042]  Uh, in Missouri.
[03:04:18.422 --> 03:04:23.483]  You post that to Dig or to Reddit, and no matter how many votes it gets, it never goes to the front page.
[03:04:23.543 --> 03:04:25.864]  Right, because like you said, the bots are keeping it down.
[03:04:26.144 --> 03:04:36.466]  And that's the whole idea behind Reddit, is it's supposed to be a way for people to, on their own, right, self-select, upvote, downvote, as you said, and they have control, but you don't actually have control.
[03:04:36.946 --> 03:04:38.286]  It's all the appearance of control.
[03:04:38.366 --> 03:04:43.647]  On InfoWars.com, if you look at the most popular, it's just your comments, and how many people read it,
[03:04:44.855 --> 03:04:46.957]  That's what goes to the top, and we don't censor that.
[03:04:47.237 --> 03:04:47.397]  Yeah.
[03:04:47.537 --> 03:04:50.439]  I don't see some story up there that I don't like and go, hey, wait a minute.
[03:04:50.639 --> 03:04:51.260]  Move that one out.
[03:04:51.540 --> 03:04:53.502]  Yeah, you know, take that off the top most popular.
[03:04:53.842 --> 03:04:57.244]  Now, sometimes in the featured news, I'll say, hey, I want this back as the top story.
[03:04:57.284 --> 03:05:02.068]  But that's the difference between censorship and placement of stories.
[03:05:02.208 --> 03:05:02.768]  Absolutely.
[03:05:02.788 --> 03:05:04.530]  Well, listen, Ben Swan, thank you for coming in.
[03:05:04.570 --> 03:05:06.031]  Great to meet you in person.
[03:05:06.091 --> 03:05:07.912]  You are the tip of the spear in alternative media.
[03:05:07.932 --> 03:05:08.473]  We salute you.
[03:05:08.693 --> 03:05:08.913]  Thank you.
[03:05:09.696 --> 03:05:21.282]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[03:05:21.623 --> 03:05:23.464]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[03:05:23.664 --> 03:05:24.364]  Fluoride.
[03:05:24.544 --> 03:05:26.345]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[03:05:26.465 --> 03:05:29.547]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
