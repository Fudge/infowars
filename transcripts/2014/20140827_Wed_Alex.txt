[00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:06.435]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:08.196]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:09.957]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:11.558]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:13.120]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.323]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.323 --> 00:00:21.385]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.527]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:27.952]  It is Wednesday, the 27th day of August 2014.
[00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:29.274]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:31.997]  We'll be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours live.
[00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:41.868]  Channel casting on over 165 AM and FM stations across the United States, global shortwave, and of course the internet with the free podcast, the free audio streams, and more.
[00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:44.469]  I want to open the phones up early in the broadcast.
[00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.670]  I've been getting a little bit better over the years about taking calls.
[00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.371]  I want to open the phones up in the first hour for first-time callers to cover the waterfront.
[00:01:11.914 --> 00:01:21.099]  of what's happening in our world and the move towards a scientifically deployed technocratic system.
[00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:33.607]  So I will give the number out right now for first-time callers for your questions, your comments, if you agree, if you disagree, any topic you want to raise, anything you want to bring up.
[00:01:33.607 --> 00:01:35.508]  All I ask when we don't screen your calls
[00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:37.885]  We don't screen your calls, period.
[00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:39.408]  We'll say we're on a certain subject sometimes.
[00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:40.570]  You need to talk about that subject.
[00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.111]  Give us your take.
[00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:44.537]  But when it's a free-for-all, all I ask is you have a good telephone.
[00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:47.882]  And when you hear the pshhht, that means we're going to you.
[00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:54.334]  That you talk to me like you're explaining to me what your question is.
[00:01:54.334 --> 00:02:00.638]  Because sometimes when we have a free-for-all, people call in and just start talking about subjects that I don't even know what they're talking about.
[00:02:00.638 --> 00:02:03.239]  And I know the listeners don't in most cases.
[00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.320]  I'm sure there's somebody out there that knows what they're talking about.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.642]  So just be clear or I'll move the next person.
[00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:07.702]  800-259-9231.
[00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:07.742]  800-259-9231.
[00:02:15.998 --> 00:02:18.341]  We're going to get an update from Cliven Bundy.
[00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:23.166]  We haven't had him on in a few months since that crisis built up and then faded away.
[00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:28.492]  Shadows and a portend of what's obviously coming in the future.
[00:02:28.492 --> 00:02:36.421]  Why did that end differently than places like Ferguson where we ended up having two additional shooting deaths by the police?
[00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:40.469]  That in both cases appeared to be people threatening to assault them.
[00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.372]  Why did that not go haywire in this case?
[00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.994]  As the feds expand their land grabbing.
[00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:50.317]  So pop in for 30 minutes at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:54.667]  We're going to have a ton of other news to cover, obviously.
[00:02:54.667 --> 00:03:00.488]  We're going to talk about existential envy, which the globalists use in class envy to manipulate.
[00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:13.391]  Max Scheller, the philosopher and proto-psychologist, exposed that, and I absolutely agree with his theorem on it to understand how advertising, how establishment advertising works.
[00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.211]  So we're going to look at some of the mind control today as well.
[00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:25.692]  Obviously, in big news, the IMF chief has been charged with negligence over graft case.
[00:03:25.692 --> 00:03:28.213]  Boy, that is just classic.
[00:03:28.213 --> 00:03:29.033]  And it begins.
[00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:36.935]  The Council on Foreign Relations is calling for the megabanks, the private Federal Reserve, to issue cash directly.
[00:03:37.455 --> 00:03:42.158]  To the American people, training us to love our new government that's been our government since 1913.
[00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:45.160]  They're just coming out in the open now.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.604]  That's coming to us from the council on foreignrelations.org and Zero Hedge.
[00:03:50.604 --> 00:03:52.325]  All up on infowars.com.
[00:03:52.325 --> 00:04:02.232]  And this is done so that when they start, quote, taking people's private pensions and bank accounts to collectivize them, to protect them.
[00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:02.953]  That's in quotes.
[00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:05.575]  This has been the model in third world countries and now Europe.
[00:04:06.448 --> 00:04:17.235]  That the giant mass of people that actually get a little piece of it, who actually get a check from the private federal reserve, will then say, oh yeah, take over the economy!
[00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:19.557]  Wow, they're the folks a few years ago that sent us checks!
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.645]  They'll send you fiat checks that accelerate the devaluation of earning power.
[00:04:26.645 --> 00:04:30.468]  They've already given themselves literally hundreds of trillions of U.S.
[00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:33.831]  dollars, which is devalued currencies worldwide, not just ours.
[00:04:33.831 --> 00:04:41.218]  Now that those chickens are about to come home, they're looking at flooring the pedal with dollar devaluation and then blaming it
[00:04:42.472 --> 00:04:53.528]  On the bail-ins to the American people before the total bail-in guillotine economic takeover and the move towards the global digital SDR.
[00:04:53.528 --> 00:04:57.695]  A key bellwether, a key balloon, a key red flag has sailed.
[00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:06.621]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:14.527]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:28.358]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jeans Company.
[00:05:28.914 --> 00:05:32.556]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:36.837]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.618]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:38.618 --> 00:05:46.481]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:47.622]  But for how long?
[00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:54.265]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:54.265 --> 00:05:57.066]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:58.894 --> 00:06:00.155]  Another major health threat.
[00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:05.137]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:06:05.137 --> 00:06:07.798]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:06:07.798 --> 00:06:14.841]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.842]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:06:17.842 --> 00:06:20.863]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:06:20.863 --> 00:06:22.804]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:06:22.804 --> 00:06:25.665]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:31.469]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.952]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:06:34.952 --> 00:06:38.054]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:06:38.054 --> 00:06:45.379]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:48.601]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:55.586]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:17.439]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:22.861]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:30.283]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:34.404]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:07:34.404 --> 00:07:39.526]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:40.366]  This is innovating.
[00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:47.968]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:52.408]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:08.272]  Watch me!
[00:08:08.272 --> 00:08:08.752]  I got it!
[00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:12.060]  Hey!
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:18.506]  I got somethin' that makes me wanna shout!
[00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:21.468]  I got somethin' that tells me what it's all about!
[00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:22.750]  I got soul, and I'm super bad!
[00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.310]  I got soul!
[00:08:38.547 --> 00:08:42.270]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna have open phones throughout the three hours today.
[00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.551]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:44.551 --> 00:08:46.493]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:47.593]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:49.094]  Central Standard Time.

[00:08:52.637 --> 00:08:54.518]  Broadcasting worldwide.

[00:08:58.661 --> 00:09:02.864]  From Los Angeles, California to Rochester, New York.
[00:09:02.864 --> 00:09:03.785]  From Orlando...
[00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:07.345]  Florida to Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:16.911]  We're on over 165 AM and FM affiliates, and we're number one when it comes to political talk, not just liberal or conservative political talk, period.

[00:09:35.043 --> 00:09:36.564]  Awesome.
[00:09:36.564 --> 00:09:40.747]  Again, thank you so much for tuning in and joining us today.
[00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.048]  Let me just do this.
[00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:50.115]  I want to take a lot of calls and the wild card grab bag of any issue, any question, any comment, agree, disagree, 800-259-9231.
[00:09:50.115 --> 00:09:52.397]  But in this first hour, I want first time callers.
[00:09:57.927 --> 00:10:00.168]  Then we'll continue with calls into the middle of the next hour.
[00:10:00.168 --> 00:10:02.749]  Cliven Bundy from the whole Bundy Ranch standoff.
[00:10:02.749 --> 00:10:04.689]  That's been over for a couple months.
[00:10:04.689 --> 00:10:05.610]  But is it really over?
[00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:12.072]  We're going to get an update with some new revelations and look at the larger unrest in the country.
[00:10:12.072 --> 00:10:18.414]  Why did this end up being peaceful versus Ferguson with the deaths and injuries up there?
[00:10:18.414 --> 00:10:20.835]  All that and more is coming up today.
[00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:29.684]  Let's first begin with just some of the headlines here that I'm going to read through.
[00:10:29.684 --> 00:10:32.904]  Peace president plots war on Syria.
[00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:48.789]  The Obama administration is reportedly preparing to begin airstrikes on Syrian territory without the consent of the Syrian government, claiming they need to take out the IS al-Qaeda forces that were funded by NATO and our own government in the last four years to topple Assad.
[00:10:49.588 --> 00:10:59.552]  The same Al-Qaeda forces that got caught, according to even Turkish and British news, we first broke it, of course, at Infowars.com, launching fake chemical attacks.
[00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:03.994]  It was real chemicals, but faking it and saying Assad had done it.
[00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:18.801]  It was pretty obvious whenever Obama came out about a year before, two years ago, and said, if any chemical weapons get used, we're going to bomb the government and take over for the rebels.
[00:11:19.778 --> 00:11:29.343]  And so then three times the rebels fired chemical weapons traced back even by the UN weapons inspectors to Saudi Arabian chemicals.
[00:11:29.343 --> 00:11:30.764]  This is in the BBC.
[00:11:30.764 --> 00:11:32.905]  This is in the Turkish daily papers.
[00:11:32.905 --> 00:11:35.946]  This came out and the whole thing got shut down.
[00:11:35.946 --> 00:11:48.713]  So now they're back wanting to bomb Syria and having US aircraft fly over with the cover of the American people wanting ISIS, who's killed 300,000 plus people, mainly Christians in Syria, dealt with.
[00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:56.825]  But who gave them bases in Eastern or in Western Iraq to go into Eastern Syria?
[00:11:56.825 --> 00:11:58.486]  NATO, the globalists, Obama.
[00:11:58.486 --> 00:12:00.447]  That's a fact.
[00:12:00.447 --> 00:12:03.589]  This is a real test to the American people and the people of the West.
[00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:10.934]  Are we as politically ignorant and politically illiterate as the political ruling class thinks we are?
[00:12:12.421 --> 00:12:26.871]  Will they bomb the Syrian military that lets Christians and Jews and non-radical Muslims live in peace, and their government doesn't wear burqas and wear suits and ties, and women can go to college and not wear hoods on their heads?
[00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:36.997]  Will the liberal West keep trying to overthrow governments that are doing nothing to us, that are angelic compared to Al-Qaeda?
[00:12:36.997 --> 00:12:40.539]  They're picking out the targets, they're getting ready to overthrow the Syrian government.
[00:12:40.539 --> 00:12:40.960]  You watch.
[00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:46.450]  Islamic State video indicates terror group has sophisticated drones.
[00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:54.352]  They released video showing their brigades marching and their drones going in so they can target Assad's forces and U.S.
[00:12:54.352 --> 00:12:55.592]  forces now in Iraq.
[00:12:55.592 --> 00:12:58.273]  Oh, and by the way, it's a real enemy.
[00:12:58.273 --> 00:13:02.133]  I mean, they're going to kill advisors, they're going to kill contractors.
[00:13:02.133 --> 00:13:03.174]  These people killed U.S.
[00:13:03.174 --> 00:13:04.054]  troops before.
[00:13:04.054 --> 00:13:05.634]  They bragged about it.
[00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:09.475]  When they took over Libya, they said, next stop Syria, then the United States.
[00:13:11.331 --> 00:13:16.013]  And now we're being told, brace for terror attacks in America with IS.
[00:13:16.013 --> 00:13:18.554]  Continuing.
[00:13:18.554 --> 00:13:22.555]  American man reportedly killed fighting for ISIS dies in Syria.
[00:13:22.555 --> 00:13:32.379]  One of three foreign fighters alleged and aligned with Islamic State forces killed in battle in Syria fighting Syrian forces.
[00:13:34.687 --> 00:13:36.648]  The truth is America passed the test.
[00:13:36.648 --> 00:13:51.236]  We've not been proven totally politically and geopolitically illiterate when our own military and our own political class to a great extent rejected openly becoming Al Qaeda's Air Force or IS's Air Force in Syria last year.
[00:13:51.236 --> 00:13:54.458]  Continuing, gold ends firmer on short covering.
[00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:59.301]  Bargain hunting, silver also slightly up as dollar devaluation news.
[00:14:01.627 --> 00:14:03.767]  Sends other commodities up as well.
[00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:08.569]  Coast Guard Cutter fires warning shot at Iranian sailboat in brief altercation.
[00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:10.809]  No, it wasn't an Iranian boat off the U.S.
[00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:11.869]  coast.
[00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:13.770]  It was off the Iranian coast.
[00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.410]  Coast Guard's all the way over there.
[00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:23.852]  Coast Guard Cutter fires warning shot at Iranian sailboat in brief altercation, claiming that they aimed some type of submachine gun at them.
[00:14:23.852 --> 00:14:28.513]  Going back to Syria, West's unlikely to seek Assad's help against ISIS.
[00:14:29.754 --> 00:14:32.887]  Unlikely Western countries will collaborate with Assad to combat ISIS.
[00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:36.042]  That's really a sick joke.
[00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:44.124]  Now that the West is so upset that the public knows that they're running Al-Qaeda, this is all a bunch of elaborate baloney.
[00:14:44.124 --> 00:14:47.285]  Bomb a Toyota truck, bomb an old piece of artillery.
[00:14:47.285 --> 00:14:49.185]  Never do I see troops running away.
[00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:55.527]  Never do I see Al-Qaeda dead on the ground, flopping around, blood spraying out like you do on the other infrared videos.
[00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:57.667]  All I see are FLIR videos.
[00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.567]  All I see is staged events.
[00:14:59.567 --> 00:15:01.868]  They're not bombing ISIS, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:07.940]  They put them there, they armed them, they work for Saudi Arabia.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:14.023]  And as usual, Saudi Arabia reportedly attacks us on 9-11, we attack Iraq.
[00:15:14.023 --> 00:15:17.284]  Al-Qaeda's attacking Syria, we attack Syria.
[00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:22.066]  Because Saudi Arabia is puppeteering this country to a great extent.
[00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:25.007]  It is disgusting.
[00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:26.387]  Alright, so there's that stack of news.
[00:15:26.387 --> 00:15:28.028]  I'm going to your calls in the next segment.
[00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:31.629]  Let me just continue moving right along here.
[00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:33.250]  Ferguson investigates
[00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:39.419]  And it's an investigation out of Fusion.net.
[00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:46.307]  How did America's police departments lose loads of military-issued weapons?
[00:15:46.307 --> 00:15:49.190]  I'll tell you, they sold them out the back door for money.
[00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.315]  Just like most police departments, when they do gun buybacks, end up selling them out the back door.
[00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:56.250]  And there's all these articles.
[00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:00.634]  Here's another one out today out of CBS News.
[00:16:00.634 --> 00:16:09.280]  Davis City Council tells police in California to have planned for getting rid of their MRAP military vehicle in the next 60 days.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.604]  The public asked, why are you getting wheeled tanks and automatic weapons for us?
[00:16:13.604 --> 00:16:18.648]  Which is an important question, but Congress is now investigating this.
[00:16:18.648 --> 00:16:23.332]  It's like blaming the TSA that's groping you when Congress passes laws to carry this out.
[00:16:24.716 --> 00:16:28.137]  Or it's like blaming the police when they're given the federal training.
[00:16:28.137 --> 00:16:35.619]  The feds are coming in to federalize police now after giving them this martial law training that turns the public against them.
[00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:42.041]  Then the feds will come in federalizing the police in the name of fixing the problem they basically created.
[00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:49.083]  It was like, oh, in Ferguson last week, in Missouri, thank heaven, Obama has sent Holder here.
[00:16:49.083 --> 00:16:50.243]  He'll fix it.
[00:16:52.403 --> 00:16:57.187]  Holder was clearly involved in the Oklahoma City cover-up of who was really involved.
[00:16:57.187 --> 00:16:59.889]  I've interviewed the Oklahoma City police officers that witnessed it.
[00:16:59.889 --> 00:17:04.953]  As deputy head, he was deputy attorney general, now attorney general.
[00:17:04.953 --> 00:17:18.884]  Holder has been involved in Fast and Furious, everything else you can imagine, covering up all the trillions being looted in the last seven years, covering up all the executive abuses, and accelerating the federalization
[00:17:20.928 --> 00:17:44.827]  of police at light speed and now there's all these articles demonizing local police and all these national news stories showing police brutality and taser deaths after the federal grants paid for all of it and the threat fusion centers and the military training and the uniforms and and the doctrine and shifting away from crime fighting to revenue generating that is all globalist doctrine
[00:17:46.889 --> 00:17:52.930]  They turn the police into their own tool, and then after the public turns against them, the feds come in as the saviors.
[00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.171]  So just be aware of the larger PSYOP.
[00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:58.011]  I'm not defending the militarization of police.
[00:17:58.011 --> 00:18:03.392]  I am the trailblazer on record for 19 years exposing the police state.
[00:18:03.392 --> 00:18:09.034]  I warned you of the COG, of the kill switches on the computers, of tracking and taxing you by the mile.
[00:18:09.034 --> 00:18:11.214]  I warned you of blood draws to get driver's license.
[00:18:11.454 --> 00:18:13.056]  That's now starting in D.C.
[00:18:13.056 --> 00:18:13.917]  last year.
[00:18:13.917 --> 00:18:16.960]  I warned you of everything because it was in government documents.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:24.488]  I learned in 1998 of secret microphones being put in white poles from Chicago, Illinois to Austin, Texas.
[00:18:24.488 --> 00:18:27.111]  It's now mainstream news this year.
[00:18:27.111 --> 00:18:30.174]  CBS News Associated Press.
[00:18:30.174 --> 00:18:31.756]  I don't have a crystal ball.
[00:18:33.835 --> 00:18:38.276]  I don't sit there around a black pot, staring into it and reading tea leaves.
[00:18:38.276 --> 00:18:42.217]  This is all a technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[00:18:42.217 --> 00:18:44.298]  I've read five Brzezinski books.
[00:18:44.298 --> 00:18:46.398]  He basically runs the show.
[00:18:46.398 --> 00:19:02.843]  As the Council on Foreign Relations admits, he and Henry Kissinger, the head of the National Security Council, General Jones, five years ago, five years ago in 2009, openly told British newspapers that they get their orders from the Council on Foreign Relations and Henry Kissinger daily.
[00:19:05.302 --> 00:19:12.564]  Now the Council on Foreign Relations leadership, their central board, the rest is influence peddling and are minions and camp followers.
[00:19:12.564 --> 00:19:14.664]  It's been expanded over 10,000 people now.
[00:19:14.664 --> 00:19:20.826]  But the top 100 or so, they decide when the satellite tracker box goes in your car.
[00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.206]  It's in there by law now.
[00:19:22.206 --> 00:19:26.267]  They decide when the banks start grabbing your private money.
[00:19:26.267 --> 00:19:26.887]  They decide.
[00:19:26.887 --> 00:19:28.088]  I mean, here it is today.
[00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:29.668]  Council on Foreign Relations calls for
[00:19:30.468 --> 00:19:33.209]  Uh, central banks should totally, openly take over the government.
[00:19:33.209 --> 00:19:34.129]  I'll be covering that.
[00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:34.710]  Here's another one.
[00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:41.532]  DOT, Department of Transportation, proposes mandating cars, broadcast location, direction and speed at all times.
[00:19:41.532 --> 00:19:43.493]  And guess what?
[00:19:43.493 --> 00:19:46.274]  Two years ago, by global treaty and U.S.
[00:19:46.274 --> 00:19:48.434]  law, all cars now have it.
[00:19:48.434 --> 00:19:50.375]  Oh, and we told you they would do this!
[00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:51.836]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[00:19:51.836 --> 00:19:52.996]  It's now happening.
[00:19:52.996 --> 00:19:58.158]  It is a scientific, programmed, authoritarian takeover, and we can stop it!
[00:19:59.614 --> 00:20:05.679]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement.
[00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:07.741]  But only if they can detect a signal.
[00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:11.664]  Stay one step ahead of hackers and Big Brother with a Blockit Pocket.
[00:20:11.664 --> 00:20:17.208]  A custom-made pocket infused with pure silver that creates a complete Faraday enclosure for your cell phone.

[00:20:21.592 --> 00:20:22.873]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[00:20:28.817 --> 00:20:29.938]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:34.421]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:40.145]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:40.145 --> 00:20:43.727]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:43.727 --> 00:20:46.389]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:46.389 --> 00:20:51.352]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:51.352 --> 00:20:51.653]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.653 --> 00:20:52.974]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:58.177 --> 00:21:05.382]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:21:05.382 --> 00:21:07.744]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:21:07.744 --> 00:21:13.047]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:21:13.047 --> 00:21:18.031]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:21:18.231 --> 00:21:21.633]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:21:21.633 --> 00:21:25.715]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:21:25.715 --> 00:21:30.098]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:21:30.098 --> 00:21:40.364]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:21:40.364 --> 00:21:44.806]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:21:44.806 --> 00:21:46.527]  The new Infowars Live Lung Clean
[00:21:46.527 --> 00:21:46.908]  We're good.
[00:22:02.011 --> 00:22:04.432]  Curious about what comes next?
[00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:11.136]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars.
[00:22:11.136 --> 00:22:14.518]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[00:22:14.518 --> 00:22:21.002]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[00:22:21.002 --> 00:22:24.344]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[00:22:25.064 --> 00:22:30.389]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[00:22:30.389 --> 00:22:36.875]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[00:22:36.875 --> 00:22:41.680]  The new Brighter Fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.

[00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:49.087]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[00:22:57.403 --> 00:22:58.183]  Question.
[00:22:58.183 --> 00:23:02.926]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:23:02.926 --> 00:23:04.167]  Answer, yes.
[00:23:04.167 --> 00:23:10.391]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Teriganics.

[00:23:47.575 --> 00:23:48.275]  Life's getting better!
[00:23:59.161 --> 00:23:59.801]  All right!
[00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:32.242]  Marcello, Glenn, Tim, Tony, Jay.
[00:24:32.242 --> 00:24:35.203]  We're going to your calls right now.
[00:24:35.203 --> 00:24:46.607]  And then... Tepid Clapping greets unpopular Obama with his VA visit speech, his first since 2011.
[00:24:46.607 --> 00:24:50.989]  And there's more trouble for his lordship, the front man for collectivism.
[00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:57.811]  Jaw-dropping revelation, Justice Department confirms lost IRS emails are stored on backup drives.
[00:24:59.605 --> 00:25:05.330]  But of course, those blackberries and backup drives were destroyed as well.
[00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.111]  Oh!
[00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:10.695]  And it doesn't matter how many backups there are, they will be hunted down and destroyed, and then nothing will be done!
[00:25:10.695 --> 00:25:14.318]  And the IRS will come and arrest conservatives!
[00:25:14.318 --> 00:25:15.539]  Because it's freedom!
[00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:17.621]  It's not Nazi Germany!
[00:25:17.621 --> 00:25:22.625]  IRS ethics lawyer facing possible disbarment, accused of lying!
[00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.427]  That's out of the Washington Times.
[00:25:27.099 --> 00:25:36.885]  Meanwhile, many Detroit residents, as much as a third of them, can't pay their water bill, so the government had been giving them free water, which in areas like the Great Lakes area should be basically free.
[00:25:36.885 --> 00:25:39.786]  I mean, the water just comes right out of the ground.
[00:25:39.786 --> 00:25:46.090]  But no, you have to pay for the fluoride and stuff that gets added, and so tens of thousands of residents are having their water turned off today.
[00:25:47.622 --> 00:25:50.344]  Which will just further implode the entire area.
[00:25:50.344 --> 00:25:56.589]  But that's where we see our civilization going under globalist program.
[00:25:56.589 --> 00:26:08.338]  Coming up, Governor Jerry Brown announces the collapse of California and the untimely end of the United States.
[00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:10.120]  So that's all coming up.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.662]  There's a ton of news today.
[00:26:12.662 --> 00:26:14.743]  The IMF head has basically been indicted.
[00:26:16.354 --> 00:26:20.678]  Again, you're going to be taxed by the mile in your car and tracked everywhere you go?
[00:26:20.678 --> 00:26:22.820]  Oh, but the NSA's not spying on you.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:37.414]  The government just had a two decades long program, globally, in a global standardized corporate government, by 2013, to have tracker boxes in all the car's bellies that the car won't operate if you remove it.
[00:26:38.749 --> 00:27:04.930]  Think of the concerted, premeditated effort that from Australia to the United States in the last five years, smart meters have gone in on the sides of everybody's houses to track everything you're doing inside your house and to dial in to all the other quote, smart Trojan horse tech to track everything you do and use that data to corner economic markets and manipulate prices.
[00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.732]  See, a lot of folks say, well, I don't care if I'm getting spied on.
[00:27:07.732 --> 00:27:08.133]  So what?
[00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:11.890]  I've nothing to hide.
[00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.711]  Well, why don't you leave your doors open at night, then?
[00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:16.494]  Why don't you not, you know, close your blinds?
[00:27:16.494 --> 00:27:17.635]  Oh, you want privacy?
[00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.917]  Well, that means you're a criminal.
[00:27:19.917 --> 00:27:28.145]  Government's more secretive than ever, but all these corporations with government are moving towards establishing a private, corporate, global government.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:40.182]  Where they're above the law, they're exempt from the regulations, they're exempt from the red tape, then they saddle you with it as a tool of political control.
[00:27:40.182 --> 00:27:44.463]  This is a short segment, I'm going to cover news and come back with your calls in the next.
[00:27:44.463 --> 00:27:53.525]  Since I mention this form of corporate global government, there is a story up on InfoWars.com
[00:27:54.755 --> 00:27:57.717]  Dealing with this, and let me just go to it now.
[00:27:57.717 --> 00:27:59.298]  It begins.
[00:27:59.298 --> 00:28:09.084]  Council on Foreign Relations proposes that central banks should hand customers cash directly.
[00:28:09.084 --> 00:28:13.467]  So they've already given themselves conservatively $200 trillion just since 2008 and the banker bailout.
[00:28:13.467 --> 00:28:15.448]  It was a lot more than $876 billion.
[00:28:15.448 --> 00:28:17.870]  That was the Federal Reserve open window.
[00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:18.450]  That was only one move.
[00:28:27.076 --> 00:28:33.738]  When you talk about SDRs and we talk about free credit being given out to the big six central banks, it's over 200 trillion.
[00:28:33.738 --> 00:28:43.882]  The total of derivatives they've created, according to USA Today, three years ago, we haven't gotten new numbers since then, from the General Accounting Office, is 1.5 quadrille.
[00:28:43.882 --> 00:28:45.042]  That's 1,500 trille.
[00:28:45.042 --> 00:28:47.723]  Over 100 times all the real wealth in the world.
[00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:57.631]  And that's what they've signed us on to.
[00:28:57.631 --> 00:29:05.358]  Americans have been signed on to over 70% of that debt they claim we owe.
[00:29:05.358 --> 00:29:12.485]  When you're about 18 or 19 trillion in national debt, that's what they currently owe and what entitlements and real debts are.
[00:29:12.485 --> 00:29:13.386]  That's our real debt.
[00:29:14.568 --> 00:29:20.970]  And you could extend that out to 200 trillion if you look at the whole life of those entitlements and Social Security and the rest of it.
[00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.651]  So, but forget, that's off the table.
[00:29:22.651 --> 00:29:29.133]  Derivatives are what these bankers have created, and they've used that to buy up the world through fraud.
[00:29:29.133 --> 00:29:43.239]  Now they're about to drop the hammer and devalue, so they're gonna start sending out, they're discussing checks from the Federal Reserve, so that when they basically privatize the economy under their total control as a solution,
[00:29:44.209 --> 00:29:46.653]  To their already mismanaged program?
[00:29:46.653 --> 00:29:49.859]  You'll be all for it, thinking, hey, they're the guy that gave me free money.
[00:29:49.859 --> 00:29:50.821]  We'll be back.
[00:29:50.821 --> 00:29:51.261]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.261 --> 00:29:52.604]  Your call's coming up, I promise.
[00:29:59.488 --> 00:30:06.656]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:30:06.656 --> 00:30:08.998]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:30:08.998 --> 00:30:14.284]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:30:14.284 --> 00:30:19.229]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:30:19.429 --> 00:30:22.770]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.832]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:30:26.832 --> 00:30:31.154]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:30:31.154 --> 00:30:41.378]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:30:41.378 --> 00:30:43.899]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:52.307]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:30:52.307 --> 00:30:56.271]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:05.742]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:31:05.742 --> 00:31:10.304]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:31:10.304 --> 00:31:14.866]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:31:15.266 --> 00:31:18.208]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:31:18.208 --> 00:31:23.653]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:31:23.653 --> 00:31:31.038]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:31:31.038 --> 00:31:35.181]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:31:35.181 --> 00:31:39.945]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:40.285 --> 00:31:48.894]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:31:48.894 --> 00:31:53.159]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:58.384]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:31:59.206 --> 00:32:05.412]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forward situation?
[00:32:05.412 --> 00:32:08.674]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:32:08.674 --> 00:32:10.516]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:32:10.516 --> 00:32:16.862]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:32:16.862 --> 00:32:22.767]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:26.872]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:32:26.872 --> 00:32:29.776]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:32:29.776 --> 00:32:38.226]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:32:38.226 --> 00:32:40.328]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:32:40.328 --> 00:32:41.370]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:50.672]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:32:50.672 --> 00:32:53.312]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:32:53.312 --> 00:32:57.693]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[00:32:57.693 --> 00:33:02.954]  They took my saddle in history.
[00:33:02.954 --> 00:33:05.695]  Broke my leg in the Santa Fe.
[00:33:08.047 --> 00:33:14.434]  I lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[00:33:14.434 --> 00:33:20.320]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:26.049]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:33:26.049 --> 00:33:26.570]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.990]  Central.
[00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.071]  We're back.
[00:33:28.071 --> 00:33:29.292]  Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:29.292 --> 00:33:36.577]  Central, live with the Sunday broadcast, weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:36.577 --> 00:33:42.982]  Coming up, I want to look at existential envy, a psychological term developed by Max Schiller.
[00:33:44.804 --> 00:33:50.209]  We're also going to look at Governor Jerry Brown announces collapse of California and ultimately the U.S.
[00:33:50.209 --> 00:33:51.831]  That's really what he's doing.
[00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:57.937]  Pew survey, one-third of Mexicans want to move to America and get all the free stuff, which is their entitlement.
[00:33:57.937 --> 00:34:01.921]  They're entitled to that, according to Obama and the Democrats.
[00:34:01.921 --> 00:34:03.443]  60% disapprove of their president.
[00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:05.370]  Let's go.
[00:34:20.486 --> 00:34:26.696]  We're going to get into China to replace Google and Microsoft with homegrown OS, their own operating system.
[00:34:26.696 --> 00:34:28.279]  What do you think Google and Microsoft are?
[00:34:28.279 --> 00:34:30.522]  They're basically NSA operating systems.
[00:34:30.522 --> 00:34:34.930]  So China knows what it's doing, replacing one global tyranny with their own global tyranny.
[00:34:37.073 --> 00:34:38.254]  We also have another report here.
[00:34:38.254 --> 00:34:40.776]  Forget peak oil and peak credit.
[00:34:40.776 --> 00:34:46.462]  We are on the downslope of peak intelligence and major studies show that.
[00:34:46.462 --> 00:34:48.964]  We're going to be breaking some of that down.
[00:34:48.964 --> 00:34:51.426]  And the social engineers have come out.
[00:34:51.426 --> 00:35:01.696]  The radical plan to phase out Earth's predatory species not just domesticates humans to be docile for the super predator class, the globalists, but to make animals
[00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:12.317]  To where they can't be predators, like cheetahs and wolves, and then I guess watch them all starve to death, because I guess inherently predatory activity is evil.
[00:35:12.317 --> 00:35:16.941]  No, it's any predatory activity not carried out by the New World Order is evil.
[00:35:16.941 --> 00:35:20.203]  I guess when a gazelle eats grass, it's being predatory.
[00:35:20.203 --> 00:35:24.046]  So the only way to stop that is to kill all life on Earth.
[00:35:24.046 --> 00:35:28.770]  You know, if you want to get an Alex Jones quote, here's one that hit me the other day.
[00:35:30.134 --> 00:35:31.495]  And it's this.
[00:35:31.495 --> 00:35:35.779]  Life gave birth to death.
[00:35:35.779 --> 00:35:41.424]  God gave birth to life.
[00:35:41.424 --> 00:35:44.787]  And life gave birth to death.
[00:35:44.787 --> 00:35:48.110]  Because there is no death if there's not life.
[00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:52.254]  Life is the full continuum, the full spectrum.
[00:35:52.254 --> 00:35:54.356]  And then death is only an aspect of life.
[00:35:55.384 --> 00:36:05.427]  You could say that life is the universe experiencing consciousness through a physical third-dimensional manifestation.
[00:36:05.427 --> 00:36:08.968]  But I know this.
[00:36:08.968 --> 00:36:18.791]  The New World Order and their jumbo jets and their red carpets and Hollywood stars is not the end-all be-all of this world.
[00:36:18.791 --> 00:36:23.092]  And unfortunately most people never get to figure that out because they never attain
[00:36:24.324 --> 00:36:49.236]  Entrance or entree into that and so they're always imagining it as the fabled Grass that is greener on the other side of the valley And so they feel unfulfilled and that is the essence of globalist programming The essence of their conditioning and their manipulation and I will cover it in the third hour today, but now without further ado I'm gonna go to your calls
[00:36:50.686 --> 00:36:54.909]  And I'm going to move the next person, and then as you hear callers hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[00:36:54.909 --> 00:36:55.850]  I'd love to hear from you.
[00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.511]  First-time callers, 800-259-9231.
[00:36:57.511 --> 00:37:05.356]  Let's go to a caller in Florida first.
[00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:06.797]  Let's go to Glenn.
[00:37:06.797 --> 00:37:09.519]  Glenn, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:13.282]  Alex, first-time caller, longtime listener.
[00:37:13.282 --> 00:37:18.125]  I want to bring to your attention, I'm sure you've seen the things on the currency.
[00:37:19.415 --> 00:37:22.777]  The 10, the 50, and the $100 bill.
[00:37:22.777 --> 00:37:26.339]  All three of them have some kind of false flag on them.
[00:37:26.339 --> 00:37:29.340]  This has been pointed out by a man named Jonathan Kleck.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.362]  I highly encourage people to check out his videos.
[00:37:33.362 --> 00:37:39.045]  On the 10, it appears that there's a tsunami hitting a coastal city.
[00:37:39.045 --> 00:37:40.766]  I believe this to be Miami.
[00:37:40.766 --> 00:37:42.287]  It's something you can research.
[00:37:42.287 --> 00:37:48.330]  There's something called Miami is the last point in the pentagram that you can check out on YouTube.
[00:37:49.102 --> 00:37:54.986]  Uh, number two is the 50, which appears to be Hoover Dam, uh, being hit.
[00:37:54.986 --> 00:38:02.492]  And the other one is the 100, the new 100, which has a picture of New York City, it appears, being hit by a tsunami.
[00:38:02.492 --> 00:38:14.280]  Now, on, uh, with, with all three, one of the things that I don't know if you've ever thought about, um, the idea that, uh, the enemy likes to broadcast what they're about to do.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.081]  And in turn,
[00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:19.013]  They can, it's like a firefighter setting a fire.
[00:38:19.013 --> 00:38:23.216]  They set the fire, come in and look like the hero.
[00:38:23.216 --> 00:38:27.640]  What if all three of these false flags were thwarted somehow?
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:41.833]  And this was an attempt to get us to go along with the New World Order, get along, go along with all the security measures that we have in place, and make, perhaps, the President look like the hero.
[00:38:42.745 --> 00:38:45.266]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:38:45.266 --> 00:38:48.307]  That's pretty esoteric for the first call out of the gate.
[00:38:48.307 --> 00:38:55.210]  So let me just briefly, for new listeners, basically break down what you're talking about.
[00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.831]  I know that the global elites are into numerology.
[00:38:57.831 --> 00:39:01.232]  They are obsessed with hiding what they're going to do in plain view.
[00:39:02.594 --> 00:39:09.780]  If you look at some of the new money that came out right before 9-11, it looks just like the World Trade Center towers falling.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.123]  If you look at some of the new money that's come out, it looks just like Hoover Dam.
[00:39:13.123 --> 00:39:15.085]  It looks like tsunamis.
[00:39:15.085 --> 00:39:17.187]  It looks like the Pentagon being hit.
[00:39:17.187 --> 00:39:19.669]  It is extremely scary.
[00:39:19.669 --> 00:39:22.572]  And then you realize that the old money that we had since 1913 or so,
[00:39:24.952 --> 00:39:45.183]  Had all sorts of hidden images and keys and owls and skeletons and pentagrams and that a lot of the engravers, the globalists believe money has power because it passes between hands as the symbol of their power and for really hundreds of years paper money has had all sorts of secret symbols on it.
[00:39:45.183 --> 00:39:49.246]  So undoubtedly there's something to that.
[00:39:49.246 --> 00:39:52.788]  But anyone can then look at the new money and try to guess what the next target is.
[00:39:54.335 --> 00:40:04.601]  If you want to talk about tsunami bombs, it's been in the London Telegraph, it's been in the London Guardian, it's been in the Washington Post back in the mid-90s and then again just a few years ago.
[00:40:04.601 --> 00:40:05.942]  You can type in U.S.
[00:40:05.942 --> 00:40:08.744]  Government Plans Tsunami Bombs and develop
[00:40:09.932 --> 00:40:15.375]  Hydrogen bombs on key fault lines and things that would cause that to happen.
[00:40:15.375 --> 00:40:18.236]  Does that mean that most earthquakes are government made?
[00:40:18.236 --> 00:40:19.157]  No.
[00:40:19.157 --> 00:40:20.698]  There's always been earthquakes.
[00:40:20.698 --> 00:40:22.439]  There's always been volcanoes.
[00:40:22.439 --> 00:40:24.640]  There's always been meteorites hitting the earth.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:30.263]  And so I just really don't go there a lot because you can't prove it one way or the other.
[00:40:30.263 --> 00:40:35.426]  I could do YouTube videos about this and they get millions of views and people are really into all this and I've studied it.
[00:40:35.426 --> 00:40:36.166]  I've looked at it.
[00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:37.507]  There's some real validity to it.
[00:40:38.291 --> 00:40:41.153]  But it's just something I can't prove.
[00:40:41.153 --> 00:40:47.317]  What I can prove is that our president, starting this year, ordered the Border Patrol to stand down.
[00:40:47.317 --> 00:40:52.601]  Only 70% of the people coming across are youth, under 18.
[00:40:52.601 --> 00:40:53.942]  They are pouring in.
[00:40:53.942 --> 00:40:56.264]  The border is wide open.
[00:40:56.264 --> 00:41:06.471]  And the president is inviting them in, and the governor of California, Jerry Brown, with the Mexican president yesterday, I'm going to play the clip.
[00:41:06.471 --> 00:41:07.732]  Come on, if I cue that up, if you can.
[00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:10.780]  Said, hey, Mexicans come on up here.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.521]  That's crazy.
[00:41:12.521 --> 00:41:16.764]  Imagine if the French said, hey Germans, anybody wants to come, come here, free welfare.
[00:41:16.764 --> 00:41:22.327]  Or imagine if Canada said, Americans, anybody that can come here, come here, you get free welfare.
[00:41:22.327 --> 00:41:25.569]  Well, Canada's kind of done that now with anybody that can get there from the third world.
[00:41:25.569 --> 00:41:28.871]  So is the U.S., so is Europe, and it's collapsing.
[00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:34.034]  And the plan is, get enough people in the country, give them driver's licenses, let them vote,
[00:41:34.858 --> 00:41:40.862]  Who are totally dependent on the government and what the government wants and it's checkmate.
[00:41:40.862 --> 00:41:42.123]  It's a diabolical plan.
[00:41:42.123 --> 00:41:43.604]  It's incredible.
[00:41:43.604 --> 00:41:46.747]  I can prove they ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:41:46.747 --> 00:41:48.988]  I can prove the IRS is persecuting people.
[00:41:48.988 --> 00:41:51.250]  I can prove our government funded Al Qaeda.
[00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:59.016]  I can prove that Don Salazar wrote an article about FEMA building emergency domes for during crisis all over the U.S.
[00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:00.077]  These are the models
[00:42:01.008 --> 00:42:05.872]  Of the FEMA Camp Processing Centers that were in the Emergency Centers Establishment Act bill.
[00:42:05.872 --> 00:42:10.516]  We should probably add that to it.
[00:42:10.516 --> 00:42:13.418]  FEMA building pricey domes for your safety, close quote.
[00:42:15.083 --> 00:42:21.008]  This is the government collapsing society offering the solution more control.
[00:42:21.008 --> 00:42:22.449]  What happens?
[00:42:22.449 --> 00:42:25.392]  What happens when the dollar gets devalued further?
[00:42:25.392 --> 00:42:30.817]  What happens when they shut off the power plants and move all the jobs to China, which is already happening?
[00:42:31.587 --> 00:42:32.787]  Things are going to get worse and worse.
[00:42:32.787 --> 00:42:34.108]  Crime's going to get higher and higher.
[00:42:34.108 --> 00:42:47.613]  We're going to beg for a police state, the middle class is, and then it's going to double back and the police state will then be used on anyone who is not a globalist, fellow traveler, socialist, communist.
[00:42:47.613 --> 00:42:48.673]  That's grassroots.
[00:42:48.673 --> 00:42:58.437]  The bankers are going to sit in Luxembourg, in Switzerland, in Grand Cayman, in the Cook Islands, laughing at us.
[00:42:59.639 --> 00:43:04.262]  The elite of the world are leaving Israel and leaving the United States.
[00:43:04.262 --> 00:43:22.732]  They're going to Switzerland, they're going to England, they're going to Scotland, they're going to Monte Carlo, they are going to Luxembourg, and they've all got giant yachts with helicopters and seaplanes on them, and they're ready to live at sea for years.
[00:43:22.732 --> 00:43:26.515]  I mean, quite frankly, I'm not even going to get into it.
[00:43:26.515 --> 00:43:27.135]  I'm not going to get into it.
[00:43:30.171 --> 00:43:37.471]  But that's the underground base of the future, is island, highly armored, ultra-rich redoubts.
[00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:43.674]  Former Greek islands, you name it, that the globalists have been buying for billions and setting up command bases.
[00:43:43.674 --> 00:43:45.015]  I mean, this is a war you're in.
[00:43:45.015 --> 00:43:45.935]  This is not a game.
[00:43:45.935 --> 00:43:47.557]  They're getting ready for the singularity.
[00:43:47.557 --> 00:43:51.140]  They're getting ready for the robots to basically displace the general public.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.061]  They're getting ready for the bioweapons release.
[00:43:53.061 --> 00:44:00.707]  And if you're an FBI agent or a cop or a bureaucrat who thinks you're going to be part of the establishment and thinks you're going to make it through all this, you're crazy.
[00:44:00.707 --> 00:44:05.331]  Or if you're compartmentalized and think, I'm nuts, boy, I wish I was crazy, because I'm not.
[00:44:06.437 --> 00:44:07.418]  I'm sharp.
[00:44:07.418 --> 00:44:08.598]  I'm on target.
[00:44:08.598 --> 00:44:10.199]  I'm on the inside.
[00:44:10.199 --> 00:44:12.560]  I've done 22 years of research.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.361]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:22.306]  And anybody that doesn't listen to me, or anybody that wants to laugh at what I talk about, is an idiot.
[00:44:22.306 --> 00:44:24.007]  Why did Nero set fire to Rome?
[00:44:24.007 --> 00:44:26.648]  Because he liked to watch buildings burn.
[00:44:26.648 --> 00:44:28.269]  Why did Hitler do what he did?
[00:44:28.269 --> 00:44:29.930]  Same reason.
[00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:32.131]  Why did Mao kill 84 million people?
[00:44:32.131 --> 00:44:33.312]  Because he wanted to.
[00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:39.050]  Why did Ted Bundy grab teenage girls and torture the living daylights out of them?
[00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:42.671]  Because he liked it.
[00:44:42.671 --> 00:44:49.093]  And all of you out there that are naive and think the establishment's like you and wants to watch ESPN all day?
[00:44:49.093 --> 00:44:50.534]  And act cool all day?
[00:44:50.534 --> 00:44:52.154]  Or ride your Harley around all day?
[00:44:52.154 --> 00:44:53.715]  I'm not against you wanting to ride your Harley.
[00:44:53.715 --> 00:44:55.195]  I get it.
[00:44:55.195 --> 00:44:56.316]  I'd like to go tailgate.
[00:44:56.316 --> 00:44:57.796]  I'd like to go ride Harleys around.
[00:44:57.796 --> 00:45:00.057]  I'm just trying to get something through your head, man.
[00:45:00.057 --> 00:45:03.858]  That isn't what life's all about on this planet in deep space, okay?
[00:45:06.232 --> 00:45:17.055]  If the Harley's 5% of what you do and your kids are 60% and being successful is 30%, you know, on and on and on, then you're healthy.
[00:45:17.055 --> 00:45:21.976]  But when you're 90% entertainment, 90% have fun, you don't exist to the elite.
[00:45:21.976 --> 00:45:25.977]  They see you as an animal just using up resources.
[00:45:25.977 --> 00:45:28.958]  In fact, the elite openly say you have to declare yourself sentient.
[00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:31.613]  Declare yourself sovereign.
[00:45:31.613 --> 00:45:36.640]  Declare yourself not their slave before you even get their respect.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.104]  I have the Illuminati's respect.
[00:45:39.104 --> 00:45:41.808]  I have the New World Order's respect.
[00:45:41.808 --> 00:45:43.070]  You don't have their respect!
[00:45:44.577 --> 00:45:45.978]  You don't exist to them!
[00:45:45.978 --> 00:45:47.358]  You're an animal to them!
[00:45:47.358 --> 00:45:48.419]  You're cattle!
[00:45:48.419 --> 00:45:49.479]  Do you understand that?
[00:45:49.479 --> 00:45:50.039]  And you know what?
[00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:52.080]  You do act like cattle!
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.941]  But I will not play the game of feeding on you!
[00:45:54.941 --> 00:45:58.622]  Because that comes right back on me and my soul, and my family name.
[00:45:58.622 --> 00:46:01.203]  I will not curse my family!
[00:46:01.203 --> 00:46:11.267]  But let me tell you, I look at the evil, wicked, servile, narcissistic population, and compare you to the technocrats, at least they know what they're doing.
[00:46:11.267 --> 00:46:12.608]  I'm gonna shut up and go back to your calls.
[00:46:13.353 --> 00:46:16.055]  Who's up next from Canada?
[00:46:16.055 --> 00:46:18.116]  Marcello in Canada.
[00:46:18.116 --> 00:46:20.297]  We're talking about society, that's what you're calling in about.
[00:46:20.297 --> 00:46:21.718]  Thank you for calling in, brother.
[00:46:21.718 --> 00:46:24.420]  Hey, it's an honor to speak to you, Alex.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:38.488]  Yeah, I just wanted to know, like, there's so much going on in the world right now, there's so much chaos, like, I want to talk to you about so much, but like, right now there's like major current, like, issues with our police department in Montreal, and they're like on strike, and actually- Hey, but the good news is,
[00:46:39.818 --> 00:46:43.681]  Oh, you got Burger King moving up there to the corporate headquarters!
[00:46:43.681 --> 00:46:45.122]  Get serious.
[00:46:45.122 --> 00:46:48.585]  That's like the worst thing ever, but anyways.
[00:46:48.585 --> 00:47:05.799]  Um, yeah, so like what happened was the police department like actually ransacked like City Hall and like they started a fire outside because like they're on strike right now and like there hasn't been any really quite consequences and every time like people decide to protest they like were just thrown in jail and slapped with fines.
[00:47:05.799 --> 00:47:07.541]  So like I totally don't agree with that.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.821]  No, you're right though.
[00:47:10.821 --> 00:47:23.516]  In Spain and in Greece and a bunch of other European countries the last few years, the police have been on strike and been rioting and also in France, but not even because they had their pension funds being taken.
[00:47:23.516 --> 00:47:27.400]  They were smart enough to see the pension funds being taken
[00:47:28.649 --> 00:47:35.692]  From the other state and federal agencies and knew they were next because they are always invariably next.
[00:47:35.692 --> 00:47:43.795]  But yeah, that's very hypocritical of the police to go out and attack peaceful demonstrators like I've seen them do in Canada with my own eyeballs.
[00:47:43.795 --> 00:47:50.398]  But then they're more than happy to go out and ransack things themselves.
[00:47:50.398 --> 00:47:51.198]  I saw that in the news.
[00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:57.913]  I also want to know, like, because I tried to search Fast and Furious, because you always bring it up, but I can't find it.
[00:47:57.913 --> 00:47:59.094]  I only find the movie.
[00:47:59.094 --> 00:48:00.394]  What do you mean by that?
[00:48:00.394 --> 00:48:05.817]  Okay, Fast and Furious, and I appreciate your call, was a program started in 2009.
[00:48:05.817 --> 00:48:12.361]  They gave press conferences, Big Sis and Holder, about how they were doing a gun tracking program.
[00:48:12.361 --> 00:48:15.482]  And then they got caught shipping the guns into Mexico, which was illegal.
[00:48:15.482 --> 00:48:16.723]  Then they said they didn't know anything.
[00:48:18.514 --> 00:48:25.319]  And then it came out, CBS News got the documents, the reporter published it, then she got in trouble so she quit.
[00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:28.141]  Where they said, we're going to do this to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:48:28.141 --> 00:48:30.683]  That memo was going out to ATF agents that were very upset.
[00:48:30.683 --> 00:48:35.366]  They're like, what are we doing shipping thousands of guns a month into Mexico to drug cartels?
[00:48:35.366 --> 00:48:36.907]  These are killing people.
[00:48:36.907 --> 00:48:41.651]  And they said, look, it injustifies the means, we're going to use this to blame the Second Amendment for the violence.
[00:48:41.651 --> 00:48:47.415]  Of course, the truth is, Mexico, the real drug cartels have full auto, armored vehicles.
[00:48:49.548 --> 00:48:56.644]  Goldman Sachs, well mainly Wachovia and Wells Fargo if you look at the
[00:48:58.049 --> 00:49:07.615]  Bloomberg articles, they ship in the aircraft with the weapons on board, and then they ship out, because you want to make money both legs.
[00:49:07.615 --> 00:49:17.482]  The CIA brings American citizens down there for rendition to Mexico, to a Mexican base, and then they load the slaves going to death camps on those and fly them out.
[00:49:17.482 --> 00:49:20.584]  Of course, they also load the kids, the little kidnapped kids on those.
[00:49:21.749 --> 00:49:34.318]  If you're a new listener and don't believe me, just type in $378 billion laundered by Wells Fargo and Wachovia in a two-year period.
[00:49:34.318 --> 00:49:36.079]  That article came out four years ago.
[00:49:36.079 --> 00:49:38.080]  There was a bunch of articles about it.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:43.944]  The headline was, Big Banks in Deal over laundering drug cartel money.
[00:49:43.944 --> 00:49:45.506]  But then you read the actual deal.
[00:49:46.326 --> 00:49:46.626]  There it is.
[00:49:46.626 --> 00:49:47.606]  How a big U.S.
[00:49:47.606 --> 00:49:50.427]  bank laundered billions for Mexico's murderous drug gangs.
[00:49:50.427 --> 00:49:53.488]  Yeah, that's the Guardian, but it's not as strong as Bloomberg report.
[00:49:53.488 --> 00:50:04.511]  The Bloomberg report goes off the actual federal deal, and it just shows how they run the aircraft and the logistics, and they got guys in suits and top corporate managers.
[00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:08.832]  Imagine, it's a $500 billion a year North American economy.
[00:50:08.832 --> 00:50:09.512]  There it is.
[00:50:09.512 --> 00:50:13.493]  Banks financing Mexico's gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal.
[00:50:13.493 --> 00:50:13.653]  See?
[00:50:15.097 --> 00:50:18.560]  People always say that, hey, there's no planes coming into the hood.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.461]  They're not laundering billions in the hood.
[00:50:20.461 --> 00:50:21.102]  Oh, that's true.
[00:50:21.102 --> 00:50:23.664]  No, no, it's done scientifically, U.S.
[00:50:23.664 --> 00:50:33.952]  military bases, C-130s by the hundreds landing per month, cocaine, heroin, and then little kids are put on and flown out on the special flights right to Saudi Arabia.
[00:50:33.952 --> 00:50:39.076]  And there's people waiting with pliers to rip their teeth out.
[00:50:39.076 --> 00:50:42.419]  But hey, you know I'm an extremist.
[00:50:45.947 --> 00:50:49.448]  You're all gonna understand soon, won't you?
[00:50:49.448 --> 00:50:51.049]  Sorry the show's so scary.
[00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.869]  Reality's scary.
[00:50:51.869 --> 00:50:54.370]  Of course, 99% of the military didn't even know about it.
[00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:57.291]  DynCorp, Halliburton, it's come out, they're all involved.
[00:50:57.291 --> 00:50:58.872]  In the child sex trade as well.
[00:51:00.177 --> 00:51:05.600]  My Magic Mud is a tooth whitening powder that removes plaque and detoxifies your mouth.

[00:51:58.669 --> 00:52:01.492]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:01.492 --> 00:52:06.616]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.616 --> 00:52:14.743]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:14.743 --> 00:52:19.268]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:19.268 --> 00:52:23.071]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:23.231 --> 00:52:29.175]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:29.175 --> 00:52:32.337]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:32.337 --> 00:52:37.721]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.

[00:52:58.663 --> 00:53:03.107]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[00:53:03.107 --> 00:53:07.972]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[00:53:07.972 --> 00:53:15.440]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.341]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[00:53:18.341 --> 00:53:22.802]  I've taken away protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[00:53:22.802 --> 00:53:26.002]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:30.323]  Within a few days of taking One World Away, I noticed a dramatic change.
[00:53:30.323 --> 00:53:34.244]  Also in the past few years I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:37.685]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[00:53:38.465 --> 00:53:38.745]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:53:38.745 --> 00:53:39.226]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:53:39.226 --> 00:53:40.687]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[00:53:40.687 --> 00:53:41.707]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[00:54:07.588 --> 00:54:16.436]  If you're a new listener and you're going, what on earth is this guy talking about?
[00:54:16.436 --> 00:54:18.177]  I put on screen Bloomberg.
[00:54:18.177 --> 00:54:20.259]  We'll put it back on screen.
[00:54:20.259 --> 00:54:24.402]  A detailed 20-something page report with links to the government documents.
[00:54:24.402 --> 00:54:29.907]  Banks financing Mexico drug gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal.
[00:54:29.907 --> 00:54:31.868]  And that goes back to 2010, four years ago, June 28th.
[00:54:34.656 --> 00:54:35.917]  Now, I already knew this.
[00:54:35.917 --> 00:54:38.458]  I watched this in Congressional hearings in 1997.
[00:54:38.458 --> 00:54:50.844]  I've watched Congressional hearings in 2006, where they admitted that DynCorp and other major companies were caught running rings of kidnapped women and children worldwide.
[00:54:50.844 --> 00:54:56.027]  Why do you think you can walk into an Akron building, famously, and say, I want to run child sex slaves through here?
[00:54:56.027 --> 00:54:57.187]  They're like, absolutely.
[00:54:57.187 --> 00:54:58.248]  Welcome to the team.
[00:54:58.248 --> 00:55:00.049]  Why do you think it's on InfoWars.com?
[00:55:01.366 --> 00:55:08.593]  Sexual abuse of 1,400 children unreported due to racism fears in one town in England.
[00:55:08.593 --> 00:55:18.783]  It's because the basic labor party over there with the so-called minorities was running and trafficking with, you know, all these kids and they don't want it coming out.
[00:55:18.783 --> 00:55:22.967]  And they use the minorities as the red light district for kids.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:29.043]  And so I'm here covering all this and it sounds completely insane.
[00:55:29.043 --> 00:55:31.064]  I have congressional hearings.
[00:55:31.064 --> 00:55:33.325]  I've played them probably 20 times here.
[00:55:33.325 --> 00:55:40.430]  Just type in, um, Defense Secretary grilled on child kidnapping.
[00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:46.614]  And they admit in the hearing, yes, DynCorp got caught shipping thousands of kids out from one city alone in Serbia.
[00:55:46.614 --> 00:55:49.836]  And yes, they were given a fine.
[00:55:49.836 --> 00:55:53.238]  They were not allowed to bid in that sector for one year.
[00:55:54.957 --> 00:55:57.322]  That's a quote.
[00:55:57.322 --> 00:55:59.506]  So I'm trying to explain something to you.
[00:55:59.506 --> 00:56:02.332]  Don't be so naive anymore.
[00:56:02.332 --> 00:56:06.280]  Of course the government was involved bombing Oklahoma City and it's all come out.
[00:56:07.256 --> 00:56:08.937]  Of course they'd do that!
[00:56:08.937 --> 00:56:14.560]  Of course they'd shoot black people up with syphilis and let them die of it over 48 years with Tuskegee.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.101]  Not the whole government.
[00:56:16.101 --> 00:56:32.971]  Criminal mafias, eugenics, death cult mafias, operating at different strata, using national security secrecy to protect themselves and NSA spy grids to find out when good parts of agencies, or white hats, are about to bust them.
[00:56:35.302 --> 00:56:42.738]  Can you imagine what the evil forces were able to do since 1947 when basically the whole government went secret with unlimited money?
[00:56:42.738 --> 00:56:43.941]  With the National Security Act?
[00:56:47.998 --> 00:56:50.961]  Can you imagine the blackmail of Congress that's going on?
[00:56:50.961 --> 00:56:52.101]  That's all come out now?
[00:56:52.101 --> 00:56:54.704]  The blackmail of Parliament in England?
[00:56:54.704 --> 00:56:56.325]  The blackmail in France?
[00:56:56.325 --> 00:56:58.067]  The blackmail in Germany?
[00:56:58.067 --> 00:57:15.761]  We have a criminal, kleptocratic, global elite of six banks owned by less than 20 families who control almost the whole world right now and you might want to find out what their agenda is and what makes them tick, what their modus operandi is
[00:57:16.682 --> 00:57:18.944]  Or motive operations.
[00:57:18.944 --> 00:57:20.846]  Their MO.
[00:57:20.846 --> 00:57:22.327]  I'll tell you what it is.
[00:57:22.327 --> 00:57:28.853]  Go watch my free film online, End Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:57:28.853 --> 00:57:29.934]  The film sold 200,000 copies in stores.
[00:57:29.934 --> 00:57:31.095]  And about 70,000 copies here.
[00:57:35.316 --> 00:57:36.338]  I think it's more than that.
[00:57:36.338 --> 00:57:37.560]  And guess what I did?
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.482]  It's free!
[00:57:38.482 --> 00:57:39.143]  Free!
[00:57:39.143 --> 00:57:39.784]  Free!
[00:57:39.784 --> 00:57:43.571]  You can still buy the DVD with the extras if you want to support us.
[00:57:43.571 --> 00:57:47.097]  But that's how I financed this operation in the past was with those films.
[00:57:48.493 --> 00:57:52.517]  Then I came to the conclusion there won't even be a future if I even sell these things.
[00:57:52.517 --> 00:57:55.801]  So people take it for granted if it's free.
[00:57:55.801 --> 00:57:57.203]  Oh, well he's just giving it to me free.
[00:57:57.203 --> 00:58:00.526]  Why do I care if 30 million people watch it online for free?
[00:58:00.526 --> 00:58:04.851]  Why do I care if he sold hundreds of thousands of copies of it and now he's giving it away?
[00:58:04.851 --> 00:58:06.333]  I gave it away day one.
[00:58:06.333 --> 00:58:07.134]  It's always been free.
[00:58:07.788 --> 00:58:08.949]  I just want you to know the truth.
[00:58:08.949 --> 00:58:14.736]  I want you to see the globalists in the film, tell you what their plan is, so you understand how evil they are, so we can stop them.
[00:58:14.736 --> 00:58:17.039]  People ask, how do you have so much energy, Alex?
[00:58:17.039 --> 00:58:18.080]  Hey, let me tell you something.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.002]  You know about this stuff, and you're normal?
[00:58:20.002 --> 00:58:21.504]  You're freaking out.
[00:58:21.504 --> 00:58:22.666]  People say, well, why are you still alive?
[00:58:24.264 --> 00:58:26.186]  Because I've already basically said everything.
[00:58:26.186 --> 00:58:29.028]  If they kill me, it turns me into a martyr, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:29.028 --> 00:58:33.252]  And there's also a lot of good people in the system that are cheering us on.
[00:58:33.252 --> 00:58:35.194]  It's a very small, evil group.
[00:58:35.194 --> 00:58:39.278]  And all they need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing to quote Thomas Jefferson.
[00:58:39.278 --> 00:58:41.220]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:45.243]  Tim, Tony, Jay, Matthew, Jim, everybody!
[00:58:45.243 --> 00:58:46.965]  We're going to your calls straight ahead.
[00:58:46.965 --> 00:58:48.006]  I'm fired up!
[00:58:48.006 --> 00:58:48.647]  Stay with us!
[00:58:49.497 --> 00:58:55.665]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:58:55.665 --> 00:59:00.231]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:59:00.231 --> 00:59:04.797]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:59:05.197 --> 00:59:08.120]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:13.545]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:59:13.545 --> 00:59:20.952]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[00:59:20.952 --> 00:59:25.095]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:59:25.095 --> 00:59:29.880]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:38.667]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:59:38.667 --> 00:59:43.070]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:52.217]  Take advantage of this unprecedented, 30% off, super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:52.217 --> 00:59:54.599]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.599 --> 00:59:57.381]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:10.132]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.132 --> 01:00:11.712]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.712 --> 01:00:13.233]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.233 --> 01:00:17.414]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:21.456]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.117 --> 01:00:32.060]  Alright, I was ranting a bit last hour.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.063]  We are taking tons of your calls.
[01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:36.145]  This hour, Clive and Bundy's coming up.
[01:00:36.145 --> 01:00:37.888]  A ton of financial news.
[01:00:37.888 --> 01:00:42.955]  Also, some Bay Area residents reported mysterious flashes in the sky during NapaQuake.
[01:00:42.955 --> 01:00:43.896]  That's a well-known...
[01:00:45.993 --> 01:00:54.358]  Static electricity discharge when you've got massive mega billions of pounds or trillions of pounds of rock moving and all that static electricity.
[01:00:54.358 --> 01:00:59.082]  Of course, you're going to see those type of disturbances in the atmosphere.
[01:00:59.082 --> 01:01:01.423]  But let's go to Tim in West Virginia.
[01:01:01.423 --> 01:01:02.184]  You're on the air.
[01:01:02.184 --> 01:01:03.504]  Go ahead.
[01:01:03.504 --> 01:01:04.905]  Yes, Alex.
[01:01:04.905 --> 01:01:12.050]  The reported shooting of an accidental shooting of a range instructor outside Las Vegas this morning.
[01:01:13.344 --> 01:01:18.571]  Uh, supposedly a nine-year-old girl was firing a Uzi full-auto.
[01:01:18.571 --> 01:01:20.033]  The recoil got away.
[01:01:21.042 --> 01:01:24.964]  Yeah, that's real popular in Vegas.
[01:01:24.964 --> 01:01:27.446]  They got a bunch of those places where you can go shoot full auto.
[01:01:27.446 --> 01:01:33.409]  And I just don't think it would be wise to give a child something like that.
[01:01:33.409 --> 01:01:40.794]  Because, yeah, I mean, it's like giving a woman or a man who's ever shot a 12-gauge shotgun, and they think you lightly hold it.
[01:01:40.794 --> 01:01:43.315]  All you do is pull it into your shoulder, pull the trigger.
[01:01:43.315 --> 01:01:46.797]  But people that don't know, I mean, that's going to happen, though.
[01:01:46.797 --> 01:01:49.559]  Guns are one of the least dangerous things, statistically, out there.
[01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:54.619]  And so we shouldn't be blamed because somebody got killed, made a mistake.
[01:01:54.619 --> 01:01:55.319]  Go ahead.
[01:01:55.319 --> 01:02:00.721]  God, Alex, wasn't this exactly the same thing that happened about 10 years ago?
[01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:05.662]  Is this a replay on the news or is it an actual new event?
[01:02:05.662 --> 01:02:07.723]  You know, I don't remember.
[01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:09.723]  Are you saying you remember this happening before?
[01:02:09.723 --> 01:02:11.124]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:11.124 --> 01:02:12.524]  About eight or 10 years ago.
[01:02:14.281 --> 01:02:23.323]  It was a child involved firing a full auto Uzi that accidentally shot the instructor from the recoil.
[01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:29.204]  Well, stupidity does multiply itself, but it could be a staged event.
[01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:33.785]  Look, all we know is the official Sandy Hook story is a fraud.
[01:02:33.785 --> 01:02:36.946]  All we know is the official Aurora story is a fraud.
[01:02:36.946 --> 01:02:37.686]  It is a fraud.
[01:02:37.686 --> 01:02:41.167]  I don't want to go over the two hours of evidence, but anybody that looks at it
[01:02:42.907 --> 01:02:44.488]  Knows that it is a fairy tale.
[01:02:44.488 --> 01:02:45.628]  We don't know exactly what's going on.
[01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.769]  We just know it's a fairy tale.
[01:02:47.769 --> 01:02:50.930]  But I'm not aware of a... We should look into that.
[01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:53.551]  Can somebody send it to ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com?
[01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:56.092]  Where do you remember hearing the story before?
[01:02:56.092 --> 01:03:02.034]  It was on regular news and shortwave eight or ten years ago, maybe.
[01:03:02.034 --> 01:03:02.914]  Perhaps.
[01:03:02.914 --> 01:03:05.935]  I don't have internet or anything, but I'll let you guys look into it.
[01:03:05.935 --> 01:03:06.615]  And thank you, sir.
[01:03:06.615 --> 01:03:07.476]  I appreciate you.
[01:03:07.476 --> 01:03:08.216]  First time caller.
[01:03:08.814 --> 01:03:09.614]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:03:09.614 --> 01:03:10.855]  Yes, we have video of that.
[01:03:10.855 --> 01:03:11.836]  We're going to be playing it.
[01:03:11.836 --> 01:03:14.137]  You know, I spoke of this earlier.
[01:03:14.137 --> 01:03:15.898]  I think I should just play it now.
[01:03:15.898 --> 01:03:20.481]  Governor Jerry Brown to Mexican illegals, you're all welcome in California.
[01:03:20.481 --> 01:03:29.227]  He's welcoming anybody that wants to come in to free health care, have your baby for free, and welcoming you to everybody else's bank account.
[01:03:29.227 --> 01:03:34.830]  And welcoming you to be given a driver's license so you can then vote to take everybody's guns.
[01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:37.672]  Man, tell you, this is, I mean, if these people were libertarians,
[01:03:39.855 --> 01:03:40.536]  It wasn't very long ago...
[01:03:51.613 --> 01:03:54.434]  I have respect for the sovereignty of the United States.
[01:04:20.282 --> 01:04:23.204]  With full respect to the sovereignty of the United States.
[01:04:23.204 --> 01:04:25.125]  Oh yeah, with full respect, this is the end.
[01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:28.186]  And I want to explain when we come back.
[01:04:28.186 --> 01:04:28.967]  First I'll go to calls.
[01:04:28.967 --> 01:04:30.627]  I think I'll do it at the start of the next hour.
[01:04:30.627 --> 01:04:32.789]  Start of the next hour, I'm going to get into existential envy.
[01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:34.810]  And I'm going to get into what this is really all about.
[01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:36.451]  I mean, I want to boil it down.
[01:04:36.451 --> 01:04:37.991]  It's North American Union.
[01:04:37.991 --> 01:04:39.072]  These decisions were made.
[01:04:39.072 --> 01:04:43.394]  The supercontinent, this is it.
[01:04:43.394 --> 01:04:47.356]  And it means destabilization.
[01:04:47.356 --> 01:04:48.497]  We'll be back with Tony.
[01:04:50.282 --> 01:04:55.812]  Then we'll go to Michael, and Jay, and Jim, and everybody else.
[01:04:55.812 --> 01:04:56.834]  Stay with us.
[01:04:56.834 --> 01:04:57.335]  We'll be back.
[01:04:59.508 --> 01:05:00.769]  Another major health threat.
[01:05:00.769 --> 01:05:05.751]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:05:05.751 --> 01:05:08.412]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:05:08.412 --> 01:05:15.455]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:05:15.455 --> 01:05:18.456]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:21.398]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:05:21.398 --> 01:05:23.419]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:26.300]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:32.083]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:35.565]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:38.667]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:06:16.155 --> 01:06:18.697]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:06:18.697 --> 01:06:21.600]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:28.946]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[01:06:28.946 --> 01:06:32.609]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:32.609 --> 01:06:36.893]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:38.675]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:38.675 --> 01:06:43.699]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:46.520]  Is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.661]  But for how long?

[01:06:50.522 --> 01:06:53.344]  InfidelBodyArmor.
[01:06:53.344 --> 01:06:54.344]  Just won't quit.
[01:06:58.863 --> 01:07:05.032]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:07:05.032 --> 01:07:09.599]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:14.166]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:07:14.566 --> 01:07:17.488]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:07:17.488 --> 01:07:22.951]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:30.335]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:07:30.335 --> 01:07:34.457]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:07:34.457 --> 01:07:39.579]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:39.579 --> 01:07:40.420]  This is innovating.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:48.184]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:07:48.184 --> 01:07:52.446]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:06.693]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.307 --> 01:08:12.208]  We're going to play the clip again coming up.
[01:08:12.208 --> 01:08:14.749]  Jerry Brown says, hey, you're illegal.
[01:08:14.749 --> 01:08:15.569]  You're welcome to California.
[01:08:15.569 --> 01:08:16.729]  We're going to give you a driver's license.
[01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:18.290]  You're going to be able to vote.
[01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:18.710]  Everything.
[01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.151]  It is open treason against this country.
[01:08:21.151 --> 01:08:25.032]  Cliven Bundy, we haven't talked to him in months from the Bundy Ranch standoff.
[01:08:25.032 --> 01:08:26.833]  We're going to get an update from him at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:26.833 --> 01:08:28.574]  Your call is coming up momentarily.
[01:08:28.574 --> 01:08:32.035]  New story up on Infowars.com.
[01:08:32.035 --> 01:08:36.857]  VA training guide compares veterans to Oscar the Grouch.
[01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:43.038]  Internal materials give impression veterans are dangerous.
[01:08:43.038 --> 01:08:44.698]  Yeah, and the article goes on.
[01:08:44.698 --> 01:09:00.962]  We have all the public documents where under Obama, Homeland Security trains to fight number one, returning veterans, number two, veterans, number three, libertarians, number four, conservatives, number five, constitutionalists, and number six, Christians.
[01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:01.662]  That's official.
[01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:12.239]  Remember a few months ago, Fort Hood Manual says founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military.
[01:09:12.239 --> 01:09:20.308]  Troops told they'll be court-martialed if they join a evangelical church or the Tea Party.
[01:09:20.308 --> 01:09:24.112]  Fox News picked that up after we broke it.
[01:09:24.112 --> 01:09:25.053]  You know who gave it to us?
[01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.911]  They told me they don't even care.
[01:09:28.911 --> 01:09:30.112]  You know who gave us that information?
[01:09:30.112 --> 01:09:35.295]  Folks in Army Psychological Operations are so upset right now.
[01:09:35.295 --> 01:09:38.416]  See, you can go too far with people.
[01:09:38.416 --> 01:09:40.537]  Our military, on average, are some of the best folks out there.
[01:09:40.537 --> 01:09:41.058]  It's just true.
[01:09:41.058 --> 01:09:43.419]  I mean, at least they live in the real world.
[01:09:43.419 --> 01:09:49.142]  They're not like the average people that don't face any danger and live in la-la land and have no idea what's happening.
[01:09:49.142 --> 01:09:53.024]  They're told George Washington is bad.
[01:09:53.024 --> 01:09:53.765]  Think that won't come up?
[01:09:56.647 --> 01:10:00.829]  What are they fighting for if you don't have any freedom of association?
[01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:03.690]  This is so crazy, but that's coming up.
[01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:10.492]  The Department of Transportation proposes mandating cars, broadcast location, direction, and speed for, of course, taxation.
[01:10:10.492 --> 01:10:11.953]  That's CNS News.
[01:10:11.953 --> 01:10:14.854]  I told you that was coming.
[01:10:14.854 --> 01:10:16.495]  Because they were public about it 20 years ago.
[01:10:16.495 --> 01:10:21.256]  They said in the future, we're going to put boxes on all the cars and tax you by the mile.
[01:10:21.256 --> 01:10:25.218]  I remember even going on coast-to-coast AM about that, like in 2003, and people couldn't believe me.
[01:10:26.578 --> 01:10:28.860]  It's real.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:29.781]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:31.842]  I'm going to take a lot of them now.
[01:10:31.842 --> 01:10:40.269]  Tony, we're going to you first, then Jay, then Jim, then Matthew, then Michael, and others.
[01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:41.210]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:43.272]  Tony in Michigan, thanks for calling in.
[01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:43.792]  You're on the air.
[01:10:47.921 --> 01:10:50.283]  Yeah, a pleasure to speak with you.
[01:10:50.283 --> 01:10:56.349]  Maybe you mentioned it already and I just missed it, but what were your thoughts on the Foley video?
[01:10:56.349 --> 01:10:58.171]  To me it was obviously fake.
[01:10:58.171 --> 01:10:59.813]  I just wondered what you thought about it.
[01:10:59.813 --> 01:11:12.285]  The expert that advises the British government came out three days ago on the London Telegraph on Monday and Watson was on the show and covered it with David Knight and said it is undoubtedly fake.
[01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.772]  And that it's even been manipulated in the video.
[01:11:25.703 --> 01:11:31.327]  It's just like the Running Man, where they set up Ben Richards in that Stephen King novel that the film's based on.
[01:11:31.327 --> 01:11:35.210]  When he refuses to kill the crowd, they kill the crowd and blame him.
[01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:40.694]  The Underwear Bomber video was completely fake, where it shows him with a black hood over his head.
[01:11:40.694 --> 01:11:43.616]  This looked like it was shot by Steven Spielberg.
[01:11:43.616 --> 01:11:46.318]  It was so cinematic.
[01:11:46.318 --> 01:11:49.220]  But ISIS really does cut heads off.
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.022]  Now they're saying it's at least a year old.
[01:11:53.795 --> 01:11:54.816]  It could be real.
[01:11:54.816 --> 01:11:57.739]  They could have just taken it and souped it up.
[01:11:57.739 --> 01:12:02.723]  See, sometimes it's not that something's completely fake, it's that it's been doctored.
[01:12:02.723 --> 01:12:04.065]  And then people think the whole thing's fake.
[01:12:04.065 --> 01:12:08.309]  I mean, we take HD video we shoot, if we have time, and we'll
[01:12:10.742 --> 01:12:12.302]  Well, like you said, the quality of it, it looked script.
[01:12:38.662 --> 01:12:40.023]  They didn't show the whole process?
[01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:42.625]  I mean, did this guy even exist?
[01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:44.987]  Well, that's the main video that they put out on the web.
[01:12:44.987 --> 01:12:47.029]  They've been censoring the sites that have the full thing.
[01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:54.335]  I've watched the full thing, and there's squealing and blood spraying, and I've seen a lot of these beheadings.
[01:12:54.335 --> 01:12:58.838]  Obviously, everybody has if you cover the news.
[01:12:58.838 --> 01:13:00.500]  I've seen them chop little kids' heads off.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.042]  Of course, they don't put that on the news, but I've seen it.
[01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:16.181]  And I've also seen Iraqi children bombed by our bombs with their lower mandibles blown off, with the tongue wagging, and literally become violently angry for two or three days.
[01:13:16.181 --> 01:13:29.692]  I mean, I don't mean I'm actually violent, but in fact, a few times I've been up here totally exhausted at like midnight working on a film or something, and see some video like that, I'm not exhausted anymore.
[01:13:29.692 --> 01:13:32.575]  It's just, war period is just so evil.
[01:13:33.968 --> 01:13:41.493]  And now we have a government that pushes it preemptively and funds Al Qaeda and then uses Al Qaeda as the pretext to invade the Middle East again.
[01:13:41.493 --> 01:13:43.895]  It is just a very wicked policy.
[01:13:43.895 --> 01:13:45.296]  Anything else, Tony?
[01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:46.137]  Yeah, that was it.
[01:13:46.137 --> 01:13:46.657]  Thank you.
[01:13:46.657 --> 01:13:47.678]  God bless you, brother.
[01:13:47.678 --> 01:13:55.523]  Yeah, Watson was on for 30 minutes Monday, if you missed it, and covered the London Telegraph and others reported on that.
[01:13:55.523 --> 01:13:59.186]  Days after Watson said it was fake.
[01:13:59.186 --> 01:14:00.767]  I'll tell you what else is fake.
[01:14:00.767 --> 01:14:01.808]  Adam Gadahn, the former
[01:14:03.234 --> 01:14:10.759]  Well, the grandson of the former head of the ADL, who was arrested repeatedly beating up Muslims outside mosque.
[01:14:10.759 --> 01:14:12.099]  He hated him so much.
[01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:18.263]  He then decided to join Al-Qaeda and become their number two commander worldwide.
[01:14:18.263 --> 01:14:21.545]  That's how fake Al-Qaeda is.
[01:14:21.545 --> 01:14:27.168]  They have real jihadis under them, but they're literally Western government run.
[01:14:27.168 --> 01:14:30.811]  Jerusalem Post headline, Israel created fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[01:14:31.752 --> 01:14:34.574]  And then every time Israel didn't want a peace deal, they'd blow something up.
[01:14:34.574 --> 01:14:36.056]  I'm not even demonizing Israel.
[01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:37.437]  All these major governments do it.
[01:14:37.437 --> 01:14:39.118]  The average Israeli's not involved.
[01:14:39.118 --> 01:14:40.940]  There are real terrorists Israel's fighting.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:42.241]  But governments do this.
[01:14:42.241 --> 01:14:44.823]  That's in the Jerusalem Post.
[01:14:44.823 --> 01:14:47.085]  That's in UPI.
[01:14:47.085 --> 01:14:48.426]  That's in Haaretz.
[01:14:48.426 --> 01:14:51.108]  Israel created fake Al Qaeda group.
[01:14:51.108 --> 01:14:52.069]  Staged bombings.
[01:14:52.069 --> 01:14:53.410]  That's the exact headline.
[01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:55.471]  That's the UPI headline I just gave you from 2003.
[01:14:55.471 --> 01:14:56.372]  Look it up.
[01:15:01.237 --> 01:15:04.380]  What am I getting at here?
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:12.786]  Governments, period, are manipulated by the globalists in a standard, corporate, worldwide, fascist plan.
[01:15:12.786 --> 01:15:17.550]  Oligarchical, how do you pronounce it?
[01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:18.271]  Oligarchical.
[01:15:18.271 --> 01:15:19.732]  I've been having trouble with that word.
[01:15:19.732 --> 01:15:22.254]  Oligarchical collectivism.
[01:15:22.254 --> 01:15:29.440]  Where they're oligarchs and royal and palaces with jet copters and unlimited wealth, but you're a communist or a socialist living in a slave pit.
[01:15:30.137 --> 01:15:33.138]  And they dance around calling it liberal all day.
[01:15:33.138 --> 01:15:34.918]  That's the plan.
[01:15:34.918 --> 01:15:41.080]  And the public's so dumbed down, down in the slave pit, in cardboard boxes, they just know that helicopters fly over and dump food out once a month.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.320]  So they're like, I love Obama!
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.221]  That's why they want the third world collapsing into us.
[01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:46.281]  It's a total plan.
[01:15:46.281 --> 01:15:48.582]  It's working beautifully.
[01:15:48.582 --> 01:15:52.243]  Are we smart enough to realize the plan and do something about it?
[01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:55.044]  JN Texas, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:15:57.003 --> 01:15:58.244]  Yeah nice to talk to you Alex.
[01:15:58.244 --> 01:16:00.805]  I've been listening to you for about six years.
[01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:01.665]  I am in law enforcement.
[01:16:01.665 --> 01:16:05.307]  I don't really want to get into what branch.
[01:16:05.307 --> 01:16:23.176]  I think a lot of what's going on here and a lot of I guess in total what's happening to our country and around the world basically is going to continue until somehow somebody comes up with some type of communication device that can't be tracked by the same people listening to the conversation right here and right now.
[01:16:25.919 --> 01:16:36.106]  With all the things that are taking place here, it's very hard to fight tyranny when you can't communicate freely without someone else listening to everything you do or watch everything.
[01:16:46.462 --> 01:16:51.605]  The way to beat that is either a separate communication system, but then they would discover that and track it.
[01:16:51.605 --> 01:16:56.809]  The way to beat it is a swarm effect where everybody starts doing little things every day.
[01:16:56.809 --> 01:16:58.550]  Everybody starts telling the truth.
[01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:02.292]  Everybody starts making a stand, and then everybody steps forward.
[01:17:02.292 --> 01:17:04.234]  It's kind of like the movie scene we've all seen.
[01:17:05.134 --> 01:17:06.715]  It's based on a lot of true things.
[01:17:06.715 --> 01:17:09.656]  They draw the line in the sand and they say, who's going to step forward?
[01:17:09.656 --> 01:17:11.636]  And one guy finally steps forward.
[01:17:11.636 --> 01:17:13.237]  And then two, and then five, and then ten.
[01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:16.198]  And then suddenly everybody steps across.
[01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.919]  That's what the system is afraid of.
[01:17:19.054 --> 01:17:20.856]  Well, I just think people need to understand that
[01:17:47.682 --> 01:17:51.524]  People in law enforcement are very aware of what's taking place in this country.
[01:17:51.524 --> 01:17:54.506]  We have lemmings in our profession like everybody else.
[01:17:54.506 --> 01:18:00.009]  But for the most part, people are very awake to what's happening here.
[01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:09.354]  It's kind of hard not to see it after IRS and NSA and everything else has been uncovered that was conspiracy even three years ago.
[01:18:09.354 --> 01:18:11.215]  But there are a lot of good people out here.
[01:18:11.215 --> 01:18:11.875]  They're awake.
[01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:13.196]  They know what's going on.
[01:18:13.196 --> 01:18:15.597]  And we took a note.
[01:18:15.597 --> 01:18:16.418]  I mean, it's that simple.
[01:18:17.168 --> 01:18:19.949]  And there's many of us that are not going to go away from that oath.
[01:18:19.949 --> 01:18:23.129]  It really doesn't matter what happens.
[01:18:23.129 --> 01:18:24.970]  We're not going to go away from the oath we took.
[01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:26.590]  Period.
[01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:30.191]  So, I just want people to understand that there are good people in law enforcement.
[01:18:30.191 --> 01:18:30.731]  I know that.
[01:18:30.731 --> 01:18:32.192]  The vast majority.
[01:18:32.192 --> 01:18:42.234]  And that's why, as I've gotten more sophisticated the last 10 years, I've stated that because in my experience, I figured out the media is showing all the bad examples on purpose.
[01:18:43.877 --> 01:18:48.100]  So that, and they are egregious, so they can create that separation.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:51.523]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[01:18:51.523 --> 01:18:57.068]  I'm gonna tell the police something, and I know you're smart, you understand this, especially if you're not a greenhorn.
[01:18:57.068 --> 01:19:07.136]  Do you think if Homeland Security under the Globalist, under Obama, says veterans are the number one terror threat, who do you think they're not putting on that list?
[01:19:07.136 --> 01:19:09.417]  Who's just like the veterans?
[01:19:09.417 --> 01:19:11.199]  In fact, who is mainly veterans?
[01:19:14.406 --> 01:19:20.692]  Imagine the Jeopardy music's playing in the background.
[01:19:20.692 --> 01:19:22.653]  Cops.
[01:19:22.653 --> 01:19:26.697]  They're afraid of anybody that's masculine.
[01:19:26.697 --> 01:19:28.839]  Or anybody that's willing to engage.
[01:19:28.839 --> 01:19:30.861]  Anybody who's not a coward.
[01:19:30.861 --> 01:19:33.143]  Anybody who's not naive.
[01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:34.344]  Anybody that's red-blooded.
[01:19:35.302 --> 01:19:37.744]  That's why they want the general public domesticated.
[01:19:37.744 --> 01:19:45.291]  They only want to use the warrior class long enough to take over, and they're going to replace everybody with combat robots, which is now happening.
[01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:46.713]  So, that's it.
[01:19:46.713 --> 01:19:51.537]  This is the main fight for humanity happening right now, and it's real.
[01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:54.660]  I bet you were listening six years ago, buddy, and thought I was nuts.
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:55.841]  Not too nuts now.
[01:19:55.841 --> 01:19:57.383]  It's the world that's crazy.
[01:19:57.383 --> 01:19:58.164]  More calls coming up.

[01:20:29.842 --> 01:20:36.108]  Power Swabs was formulated by Dr. Martin Ginegar and whitens teeth with a patented tooth detergent and whitening agent.

[01:20:52.563 --> 01:20:52.823]  That's 1-800-281-6805.
[01:20:58.905 --> 01:21:01.807]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?

[01:21:58.635 --> 01:22:01.456]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:01.456 --> 01:22:06.537]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.537 --> 01:22:14.599]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:14.599 --> 01:22:19.080]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:22.901]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:23.061 --> 01:22:29.008]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:29.008 --> 01:22:32.191]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:32.191 --> 01:22:37.317]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from my Patriot Supply.

[01:22:58.132 --> 01:23:05.156]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:23:05.156 --> 01:23:06.556]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:23:06.556 --> 01:23:12.219]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience, just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[01:23:12.219 --> 01:23:16.461]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own, so stop paying for silver solutions.
[01:23:16.461 --> 01:23:22.044]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[01:23:22.044 --> 01:23:23.985]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery
[01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:37.018]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:23:37.018 --> 01:23:43.865]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:23:43.965 --> 01:23:47.666]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:48.786]  Call for your copy at 800-686-2237.
[01:23:48.786 --> 01:23:49.986]  It's time to understand the system.

[01:23:50.306 --> 01:23:50.586]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.542]  I'm gonna say it again for new listeners.
[01:24:15.542 --> 01:24:18.184]  We have a lot of new affiliates across the country.
[01:24:18.184 --> 01:24:22.588]  Like Oklahoma City.
[01:24:22.588 --> 01:24:26.531]  You'll hear stuff on this show that sounds completely nuts.
[01:24:26.531 --> 01:24:31.836]  And I do deliver it kind of in a crazy way sometimes because I'm freaked out about all this.
[01:24:31.836 --> 01:24:33.277]  I cover stuff too much.
[01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:34.959]  I work too much.
[01:24:34.959 --> 01:24:38.482]  I've been doing this 19 years and quite frankly it's gotten to me.
[01:24:38.482 --> 01:24:40.784]  So I've gotten kind of cynical and nasty about it all.
[01:24:42.193 --> 01:24:43.834]  But I'm not cynical in my heart.
[01:24:43.834 --> 01:24:47.076]  I will act cynical on air, and I've kind of psychoanalyzed it.
[01:24:47.076 --> 01:24:49.997]  It's because it hurts me.
[01:24:49.997 --> 01:24:55.360]  And only, you know, having Gallo's humor makes me feel better.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.563]  Because I get mad about the evil.
[01:24:59.563 --> 01:25:04.085]  I get upset about the attempt to corrupt our civilization by design to make us weak.
[01:25:04.085 --> 01:25:09.168]  And then I read all these globalist documents that we've covered on air, where they admit they're trying to make us dumb, down, and weak.
[01:25:10.413 --> 01:25:22.416]  Society has enough problems without trying to screw everybody over, and we're converting to a civilization based on fraud, not based on productivity.
[01:25:22.416 --> 01:25:26.597]  Sciences of scams, sciences of deception.
[01:25:26.597 --> 01:25:31.138]  That's the point we've gotten to, and nobody's perfect.
[01:25:31.138 --> 01:25:37.060]  Also, the public has had it easy so long, comparatively, where our ancestors would starve to death if they made mistakes.
[01:25:37.881 --> 01:25:41.966]  That statistics, I'm going to cover this later, do show we're getting dumber.
[01:25:41.966 --> 01:25:49.736]  Just like the movie Idiocracy with a guy who's got 185 IQ, Mike Judge, the guy's a rocket scientist, he designed a lot of the F-18.
[01:25:49.736 --> 01:25:54.942]  He also wrote that movie about people were getting stupider and stupider.
[01:25:54.942 --> 01:25:56.865]  And that's basically what's happened now.
[01:25:57.574 --> 01:26:03.256]  And then that kind of goes towards the globalist statement that, well, see the public's dumbed down, get rid of them.
[01:26:03.256 --> 01:26:06.057]  But you're trying to dumb them down even more.
[01:26:06.057 --> 01:26:08.738]  You're not trying to reverse any of it.
[01:26:08.738 --> 01:26:11.979]  And the answer is, well, that wouldn't help them anyways.
[01:26:11.979 --> 01:26:13.420]  Okay, well, here's the deal.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:14.821]  I don't want to be a slave.
[01:26:14.821 --> 01:26:16.301]  I don't want fluoride in my water.
[01:26:16.301 --> 01:26:19.462]  The Harvard study says it gives me brain damage, gives me cancer.
[01:26:19.462 --> 01:26:21.403]  I don't want your forced medication.
[01:26:21.403 --> 01:26:22.584]  I'm free.
[01:26:22.584 --> 01:26:23.804]  I don't want open borders.
[01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:25.565]  I don't want to pay for all the illegals.
[01:26:25.565 --> 01:26:26.125]  Leave me alone.
[01:26:27.799 --> 01:26:29.860]  I don't want my kids forcibly inoculated.
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:30.941]  Well, why?
[01:26:30.941 --> 01:26:43.949]  Well, because governments have a history of secret testing and putting stuff in them, and there's a lot of evidence that vaccines are giving people autism and brain damage, and the inserts say that.
[01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:46.731]  So, I don't trust you, and here's why.
[01:26:46.731 --> 01:26:53.775]  We're gonna go to Jim in Florida, and Matthew, and Michael, and Bob, and Phil, and others.
[01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:55.937]  Clive and Bunny's gonna pop in with an update here in a moment.
[01:26:56.718 --> 01:27:06.542]  Please don't forget, this hour is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com, forward slash Alex, super high quality, non-GMO storable foods, just wonderful customer service, 866-229-0927.
[01:27:06.542 --> 01:27:12.864]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you and they'll tell you about the day's specials or month's specials.
[01:27:12.864 --> 01:27:15.645]  MyPatriotSupply.com, forward slash Alex.
[01:27:15.645 --> 01:27:19.126]  Food independence has never been more important than these unstable times.
[01:27:19.126 --> 01:27:21.047]  And if we right the ship and it's not needed, great!
[01:27:21.587 --> 01:27:28.935]  But government and corporations are digging in like we're about to go to Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.
[01:27:28.935 --> 01:27:30.817]  Who runs Thunderdome?
[01:27:30.817 --> 01:27:33.520]  Master Blaster runs Thunderdome.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.802]  Who runs the world?
[01:27:34.802 --> 01:27:37.124]  Goldman Sachs runs the world.
[01:27:37.124 --> 01:27:41.649]  And by calling them out, it's the beginning of the end of their banking dictatorship.
[01:27:42.346 --> 01:27:48.873]  A bunch of narcotics, money laundering, New World Order, stock market fixing, globalist trash.
[01:27:48.873 --> 01:27:52.837]  I see them, I know what they've done, and I'm not their slave, and I'm declaring it!
[01:27:53.755 --> 01:27:56.176]  Hi Alex, I have a suggested mission that I'd like to propose to you.
[01:27:56.176 --> 01:27:57.656]  And that would be to call
[01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:37.591]  Uh, John McAfee, to see if you'd volunteer to retrieve the missing IRS emails, which are, quote, too onerous a task, unquote, for the IRS programmers.
[01:28:37.591 --> 01:28:39.013]  I mean, after all,
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:44.443]  By the way, we know their systems were on cloud backups by law.
[01:28:44.443 --> 01:28:46.704]  They have to keep the records for ten years.
[01:28:46.704 --> 01:28:48.445]  We have to keep them for seven.
[01:28:48.445 --> 01:28:50.986]  We all know where it's at and the corporation.
[01:28:50.986 --> 01:28:52.467]  They're just stonewalling Congress.
[01:28:52.467 --> 01:28:57.590]  But yeah, McAfee should come out and point out how it's a fraud because he's well known.
[01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:58.151]  Let's get him on.
[01:28:58.151 --> 01:28:58.671]  It's a good idea.
[01:28:58.671 --> 01:29:00.032]  Go ahead.
[01:29:00.032 --> 01:29:06.976]  Well, the other thing, Alex, the last time he was on, he volunteered for free to fix old vomit care.
[01:29:08.047 --> 01:29:08.928]  That website.
[01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:11.829]  That horrible debacle of a website.
[01:29:11.829 --> 01:29:14.030]  And that would be an enormous task.
[01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:20.393]  I mean, this thing would be a piece of cake for McAfee to take care of, to find those emails.
[01:29:20.393 --> 01:29:25.236]  And if he came on air publicly and said, look, I'll find them for you.
[01:29:25.236 --> 01:29:25.656]  For nothing.
[01:29:25.984 --> 01:29:27.485]  That's a genius idea.
[01:29:27.485 --> 01:29:31.166]  Bottom line, it'd be a great stunt to point out that they're hidden in plain view.
[01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:33.007]  We should do a report, because I've read all the articles.
[01:29:33.007 --> 01:29:34.147]  It's admitted in the news.
[01:29:34.147 --> 01:29:36.108]  They know right where it's all at.
[01:29:36.108 --> 01:29:37.369]  They're destroying BlackBerrys.
[01:29:37.369 --> 01:29:39.249]  There's copies of the hard drives.
[01:29:39.249 --> 01:29:41.890]  Sorry guys, it's on an email server.
[01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:44.051]  The email's not kept on the hard drive.
[01:29:44.051 --> 01:29:49.353]  It's on a government-contracted email server, saved for 10 years by federal law.
[01:29:49.353 --> 01:29:51.854]  And by the way, they never get rid of the stuff.
[01:29:51.854 --> 01:29:53.635]  They've got it at the NSA.
[01:29:53.635 --> 01:29:55.536]  They're lying criminals.
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:05.906]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:05.906 --> 01:30:10.471]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:15.036]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:15.436 --> 01:30:18.359]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:18.359 --> 01:30:23.823]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:23.823 --> 01:30:31.209]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:31.209 --> 01:30:35.332]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:35.332 --> 01:30:40.116]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:40.436 --> 01:30:48.898]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[01:30:59.301 --> 01:31:06.468]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:06.468 --> 01:31:08.831]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:08.831 --> 01:31:14.096]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:14.096 --> 01:31:19.041]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:19.261 --> 01:31:22.604]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:22.604 --> 01:31:26.668]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:26.668 --> 01:31:30.993]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:30.993 --> 01:31:41.222]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:41.222 --> 01:31:43.745]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:31:44.045 --> 01:31:52.134]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:32:33.386 --> 01:32:38.150]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:32:38.150 --> 01:32:39.151]  Talk about the effects.
[01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:40.992]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:32:40.992 --> 01:32:42.912]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:32:42.912 --> 01:32:44.013]  I feel like I look better.
[01:32:44.013 --> 01:32:44.733]  I feel better.
[01:32:44.733 --> 01:32:45.794]  I feel sexier.
[01:32:45.794 --> 01:32:46.774]  I love it.

[01:33:45.633 --> 01:33:46.894]  into the North American Union.
[01:33:46.894 --> 01:33:53.320]  He says it's our job to pay for anybody that can get here as long as they vote to confiscate the firearms.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:34:03.330]  The Department of Transportation is proposing federal law mandating cars broadcast location, direction, and speed at all times to ticket you and track you and fine you and fee you.
[01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:06.973]  This is beyond NSA spying, just in your face.
[01:34:06.973 --> 01:34:08.814]  That's CNS News.

[01:34:22.181 --> 01:34:25.443]  Also, a new satanic mass is coming to a city near you.
[01:34:25.443 --> 01:34:27.384]  IMF chief has been indicted.
[01:34:29.002 --> 01:34:37.226]  We'll also get into some very important news dealing with the IRS targeting of political groups.
[01:34:37.226 --> 01:34:40.268]  All that and more is coming up today.
[01:34:40.268 --> 01:34:45.150]  A lot of breaking news at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:48.392]  The Council on Foreign Relations says U.S.
[01:34:48.392 --> 01:34:53.655]  need not recognize Syrian sovereignty in ISIS attacks.
[01:34:53.655 --> 01:34:55.056]  So, Al-Qaeda's been attacking
[01:34:56.101 --> 01:34:58.482]  The Syrian government, our government's been funding them.
[01:34:58.482 --> 01:35:06.343]  Now they claim they want to bomb inside Syria so they can go after ISIS that they helped create.
[01:35:06.343 --> 01:35:07.323]  Amazing.
[01:35:07.323 --> 01:35:08.704]  So that's some of the news.
[01:35:08.704 --> 01:35:13.105]  Up on InfoWars.com, FEMA building pricey domes.
[01:35:13.105 --> 01:35:18.586]  That's a good article, but it should be FEMA building emergency management centers or emergency
[01:35:19.909 --> 01:35:22.891]  Re-establishment centers, as they call them, for collapse.
[01:35:22.891 --> 01:35:24.292]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:35:24.292 --> 01:35:30.757]  FEMA building pricey domes for your safety, close quote, for you to basically permanently live in.
[01:35:30.757 --> 01:35:34.420]  They collapse everything and then you go live in the government plastic dome.
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.541]  Doesn't it sound wonderful?
[01:35:35.541 --> 01:35:37.883]  Sounds like the Zeitgeist movie.
[01:35:37.883 --> 01:35:47.450]  The government devalues the money, destroys the country, and we all go to re-education camps like the great leap forward of the cultural revolution under Mao Zedong.
[01:35:49.295 --> 01:35:51.236]  But joining us is Cliven Bundy.
[01:35:51.236 --> 01:36:17.477]  Haven't had him on in a few months since the historic standoff with the feds, where Cliven's family led more than a thousand men, women, and children, dozens of them on horseback, up against paramilitary, militarized BLM, pointing live guns at them, telling them, don't cross the line or we'll shoot, to get onto his property that he's been on since the 1870s with his family.
[01:36:18.376 --> 01:36:26.701]  The feds simply declared and ran off the other 34 families that came on the same wagon train in the 1870s.
[01:36:26.701 --> 01:36:32.424]  They declared that they all just needed to leave and couldn't use the land anymore.
[01:36:32.424 --> 01:36:35.847]  Put grazing fees on the land that the government had grabbed.
[01:36:36.755 --> 01:36:39.076]  The open range, impossible to pay.
[01:36:39.076 --> 01:36:43.636]  So Cliven didn't pay those since the 90s because he said he would if the state government levied it.
[01:36:43.636 --> 01:36:48.057]  But the feds had no jurisdiction, which I agree with, and he's had court cases on that.
[01:36:48.057 --> 01:36:59.800]  And the issue here is you've got 85% of some of those western states, actually Nevada's almost 90%, that's where he's based, that are federal.
[01:37:01.212 --> 01:37:03.074]  Another 5-6% is state.
[01:37:03.074 --> 01:37:05.395]  You're talking less than 5% that's privately owned.
[01:37:05.395 --> 01:37:07.737]  I mean, this isn't America.
[01:37:07.737 --> 01:37:11.060]  And then, oh, if you're the Chinese and want to come in and build solar farms, go ahead.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.861]  Or you want to do whatever, that's fine.
[01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:15.163]  Or you want to come, you're a foreign company, fine.
[01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:16.984]  It's the shutdown of American industry.
[01:37:16.984 --> 01:37:19.166]  We told you beef prices were going to increase.
[01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:22.349]  They're all, they're at record levels now.
[01:37:22.349 --> 01:37:26.352]  Because they're harassing farmers and ranchers across the country under Obama's
[01:37:27.594 --> 01:37:31.097]  So that's why we stood with Cliven Bundy on the principle of what he's doing is right.
[01:37:50.839 --> 01:37:53.621]  And trying to get people to be self-sufficient again.
[01:37:53.621 --> 01:38:04.089]  And so he joins us to give us updates on what happened since that historic situation, one of the only times the feds have backed down in the last hundred years.
[01:38:04.089 --> 01:38:17.298]  That's because they knew what a PR disaster would be, shooting men on horseback, trying to go get their cattle that the feds had, who they were basically killing by not giving them any water, dehydration.
[01:38:17.298 --> 01:38:19.140]  So Cliven Bundy, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:38:19.892 --> 01:38:20.672]  Well, thank you.
[01:38:20.672 --> 01:38:26.534]  It's a privilege to come on with you, and it's a privilege to talk to American people one more time.
[01:38:26.534 --> 01:38:34.197]  You know, my question would be, America, the free, the land of opportunity, where is that?
[01:38:34.197 --> 01:38:36.398]  Basically, we've lost that.
[01:38:36.398 --> 01:38:40.079]  If we have that anywhere, we've got it on Bundy Ranch right now, and that's good news.
[01:38:41.701 --> 01:38:54.485]  Well, you're right, and even Rick Perry's weighed in on the fact that the BLM is claiming tens of thousands of acres that is privately owned on the Oklahoma and Texas side of the Red River.
[01:38:54.485 --> 01:39:02.628]  Well, yeah, they're not satisfied over the almost 90% of the state of Nevada and over 60% of the western states.
[01:39:02.628 --> 01:39:08.810]  They gotta go back across the Mississippi River and monkey with we the people back there.
[01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:09.510]  What's wrong with them?
[01:39:12.421 --> 01:39:14.281]  They just have an instinct to take over.
[01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:16.062]  They also have existential envy.
[01:39:16.062 --> 01:39:19.843]  They don't like people that run their own lives and are self-sufficient.
[01:39:19.843 --> 01:39:27.445]  A bureaucrat, a bean counter, is fundamentally sick at their stomach by people that are self-sufficient.
[01:39:27.445 --> 01:39:30.165]  You know, they call people like you, Cliven, wild.
[01:39:30.165 --> 01:39:32.226]  And they say that they need to get everybody domesticated.
[01:39:33.035 --> 01:39:46.523]  Now they call me a welfare rancher and also, but you know I work every day, my family works every day to produce edible commodities for we the people of America and we the people of the world.
[01:39:46.523 --> 01:39:47.383]  Now what do they do?
[01:39:47.383 --> 01:39:49.284]  Do they just cause us trouble?
[01:39:49.284 --> 01:39:51.605]  They cause every industry trouble?
[01:39:51.605 --> 01:39:55.488]  What service is these bureaucracies and bureaucrats?
[01:39:55.488 --> 01:39:57.529]  What do they do for America?
[01:39:57.529 --> 01:40:00.430]  You know, we can have a government shutdown and we don't even miss them.
[01:40:01.771 --> 01:40:08.914]  I'd say it's time that we better start cleaning these out, this bureaucracy out, because they have the guns now.
[01:40:08.914 --> 01:40:19.519]  They have their armies, and that's what come after me and my friends and family, was bureaucracy, army, with guns, a military tactic.
[01:40:19.519 --> 01:40:25.822]  And they were basically out to kill, and that's the truth.
[01:40:25.822 --> 01:40:30.024]  That's what was happening here in Southern Nevada at Bundy's Ranch.
[01:40:30.714 --> 01:40:43.916]  Well, they also have Snopes that was started by Soros groups and White House-run groups lying and saying there's no connection to the Chinese government and their solar company and no connection to Harry Reid.
[01:40:43.916 --> 01:40:45.557]  Harry Reid's people got very upset.
[01:40:45.557 --> 01:40:48.217]  They even tried to get us off the radio in Vegas.
[01:40:48.217 --> 01:40:49.237]  That was unsuccessful.
[01:40:49.237 --> 01:40:51.238]  We're on live right now.
[01:40:51.238 --> 01:40:58.779]  Why would Harry Reid want to get you off the radio or why would Harry Reid want to get me off the land?
[01:40:59.537 --> 01:41:12.700]  If he wasn't making money, I guess, is what it's all about, it definitely isn't his duty as a Senator of the United States to shut your radio down or shut my range operation down.
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:16.280]  He has to have another motive, and it has to be with something to do with money.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.641]  Well, who has all the money in the world?
[01:41:18.641 --> 01:41:20.421]  China must have most of it.
[01:41:20.421 --> 01:41:20.881]  Exactly.
[01:41:20.881 --> 01:41:25.282]  Well, they think everybody's dumb, so they don't know that his son is spending the Las Vegas Review Journal
[01:41:26.282 --> 01:41:38.049]  His son is on the board with the company, and no, the solar panels aren't going to be on your land, your open-range land that you have allodial title to on record under state law in the U.S.
[01:41:38.049 --> 01:41:43.272]  Constitution, under continuous use and being the first people there as stakeholders.
[01:41:43.272 --> 01:41:50.796]  Well, what they want to do is, even if the solar panels are not on my land, what they want to do is use my land for mitigation.
[01:41:50.796 --> 01:41:53.498]  I was about to say, you're... Because it's part of another endangered species.
[01:41:53.965 --> 01:41:54.485]  Exactly.
[01:41:54.485 --> 01:42:00.768]  What they do is they play this game on these politic check and fact check sites.
[01:42:00.768 --> 01:42:08.531]  They go, Alex Jones and Infowars.com claim that the Chinese government is going to build on Clive and Bundy's land.
[01:42:08.531 --> 01:42:09.972]  Well, A, it's not his land.
[01:42:10.632 --> 01:42:15.677]  Because I know people don't understand the difference between land that you have a right to use, open range, versus what you completely own.
[01:42:15.677 --> 01:42:17.438]  And then they tell the second line.
[01:42:17.438 --> 01:42:20.982]  They go, no, the solar panels are 50 miles away.
[01:42:20.982 --> 01:42:29.349]  But in the documents on the BLM website, it says your land is set aside as the easement for them to be able to use that.
[01:42:29.349 --> 01:42:30.691]  So they play this game.
[01:42:30.691 --> 01:42:34.054]  The point is, your land's being taken as part of this deal.
[01:42:34.514 --> 01:42:37.897]  And it's in the newspaper two years ago, before this all started.
[01:42:37.897 --> 01:42:42.461]  It's on the BLM website until they took it down, but it's on the Google Wayback Machine.
[01:42:42.461 --> 01:42:48.387]  But they count on readers and viewers being dumb and then thinking, we're making that up, Cliven.
[01:42:48.387 --> 01:42:56.414]  I know that, but what's really happening here is they want some area of this Nevada desert to build a solar panel.
[01:42:57.899 --> 01:43:01.401]  And then they want to kill the tortoises on that area.
[01:43:01.401 --> 01:43:02.861]  I say kill.
[01:43:02.861 --> 01:43:05.282]  Kill the tortoises on the desert.
[01:43:05.282 --> 01:43:07.843]  And that's their native habitat.
[01:43:07.843 --> 01:43:19.468]  Now, in order to justify that kill, or the way they call it, a take, to justify that take, they say, well, we're going to reserve some habitat over here on Bundy's Ranch for those tortoises.
[01:43:19.468 --> 01:43:20.969]  But really what's happened in there,
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:37.845]  It's not only Bundy dude and his cattle that they want off that land, they want you off that land so you can't use it for recreation, or hunting, fishing, or any other purpose, drill an oil well or a water well, easement for a utility.
[01:43:37.845 --> 01:43:46.768]  They want to lock up and lock out, and that's not only what they want, they want policing power with unlimited power, unlimited power over this land.
[01:43:47.687 --> 01:43:53.773]  Not only is Bundy right, they're using this tactic all over the Western United States.
[01:43:53.773 --> 01:43:57.176]  Basically the Western United States, but all over the United States.
[01:43:57.176 --> 01:43:59.718]  They want to lock up and lock out.
[01:44:02.753 --> 01:44:07.657]  Well, let me expand on that.
[01:44:07.657 --> 01:44:10.580]  This report is up on Infowars.com.
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.562]  It's out of the New York Times.
[01:44:12.562 --> 01:44:15.464]  Some of the news I haven't gotten to today, but I wanted to cover it with you.
[01:44:15.464 --> 01:44:28.215]  Obama pursuing climate accord in lieu of treaty and says he will act outside of Congress with the United Nations and will implement it through the executive branch.
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:37.266]  So I want to be clear, and that's red-linked on Drudge, and it should be red-linked on Drudge, that we should do a whole article on Infowars.com.
[01:44:37.266 --> 01:44:43.550]  That is our government, and Obama's saying he gets authority from the United Nations.
[01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:49.115]  My first film about the West, America Destroyed by Design, is more important
[01:44:49.915 --> 01:44:58.361]  Eighteen years later than it was when I made it, Obama pushes for UN climate rules without Congress.
[01:44:58.361 --> 01:45:00.643]  I'm going to say that again.
[01:45:00.643 --> 01:45:03.945]  And those climate rules will shut down what's left.
[01:45:03.945 --> 01:45:06.848]  Only America and Europe have to do these rules.
[01:45:06.848 --> 01:45:16.375]  It will make everything that we've got left move to Europe, I mean move out of Europe, move out of the U.S., and go south of the border or go to China or India.
[01:45:16.375 --> 01:45:17.896]  And it won't even help those people there.
[01:45:19.435 --> 01:45:27.522]  Yeah, there's a... I mean, you just can't understand how big this is when you get talking about United Nations, UN.
[01:45:29.091 --> 01:45:45.540]  I mean, you know, this environmental movement, it's basically Agenda 21, I guess you could say it, where they want to clear out all of the land from the people and give it back to nature, supposedly, and the animals.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.481]  Well, that's not really what they want.
[01:45:47.481 --> 01:45:52.084]  Again, they want to take the vast areas, basically through the Midwest now.
[01:45:52.084 --> 01:45:54.085]  They want that corridor to go from
[01:45:54.705 --> 01:46:04.630]  Canada to Mexico, take out the central part of America, and basically eliminate people and construction, agriculture, everything.
[01:46:04.630 --> 01:46:06.651]  I mean, how silly can you be?
[01:46:06.651 --> 01:46:09.192]  What kind of human being would think that way?
[01:46:09.192 --> 01:46:16.876]  Why shouldn't we go in there and develop it and increase it and better it for mankind and multiply and replenish?
[01:46:16.876 --> 01:46:19.037]  I mean, isn't that what we're sort of commanded to do?
[01:46:20.811 --> 01:46:22.352]  Cliven Bundy is our guest.
[01:46:22.352 --> 01:46:31.081]  Harry Reid famously said that anyone out there at the ranch, even peacefully demonstrating for the First Amendment, was a domestic terrorist.
[01:46:31.081 --> 01:46:34.083]  We forget that people were roughed up, beaten up.
[01:46:35.017 --> 01:46:44.524]  Tasered, including your son, on video being non-violent by paramilitary land grabbers, BLM, people masquerading as federal agents.
[01:46:44.524 --> 01:46:48.947]  They're not even that, they're UN agents under UN Treaty UNESCO.
[01:46:48.947 --> 01:46:53.810]  And now all this is out in the open that people got mad when they saw that.
[01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:55.612]  And the globalists should know as they push
[01:46:56.232 --> 01:46:57.973]  They're only going to create more opposition.
[01:46:57.973 --> 01:46:59.033]  Well, they know that.
[01:46:59.033 --> 01:47:01.394]  They want to start a civil war in this country.
[01:47:01.394 --> 01:47:09.177]  That's why it's important for the Feds and others to be smart enough to not play along with this, but we've got to be smart enough as well.
[01:47:09.177 --> 01:47:18.400]  But what do you make of Harry Reid saying, A, you're a domestic terrorist, basically, and B, that there will be a judgment day, that there will be a response?
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.102]  Very cryptically, do you expect the empire
[01:47:22.782 --> 01:47:27.445]  Of the Chi-Coms and Harry Reid and the Land Grabbers, the Locusts.
[01:47:27.445 --> 01:47:31.367]  Do you expect the parasites to strike back?
[01:47:31.367 --> 01:47:37.311]  Well, you know, Harry Reid didn't only say he was a domestic terrorist.
[01:47:37.311 --> 01:47:41.713]  He said we were violent domestic terrorists.
[01:47:41.713 --> 01:47:42.514]  That's pretty bad.
[01:47:42.514 --> 01:47:46.376]  In other words, would it be somebody that was going to bomb the city or do something?
[01:47:46.376 --> 01:47:46.796]  I don't know.
[01:47:46.796 --> 01:47:49.698]  What a violent domestic terrorist.
[01:47:50.441 --> 01:47:53.804]  Well, generally it's worse than just a domestic terrorist.
[01:47:53.804 --> 01:47:58.268]  And they didn't... Harry didn't just earmark Clive and Bundy.
[01:47:58.268 --> 01:48:03.953]  He marked all of those who stood, the thousands that stood with Clive and Bundy as violent domestic terrorists.
[01:48:04.617 --> 01:48:05.177]  I don't know.
[01:48:30.005 --> 01:48:44.171]  And by the way, we warned everyone when they passed the NDAA, when Obama signed that back in 2011, on the last day of the year, at night, on New Year's Eve, when he said he wouldn't sign it.
[01:48:44.171 --> 01:48:45.512]  Turned out his office wrote it.
[01:48:46.512 --> 01:48:48.934]  Where they could secretly arrest and disappear Americans.
[01:48:48.934 --> 01:48:54.478]  Well, look, they can put on paper that they're allowed to barbecue children on the White House lawn.
[01:48:54.478 --> 01:48:55.999]  I'm not going along with it.
[01:48:55.999 --> 01:48:59.842]  I don't care what their globalist tin badge says.
[01:48:59.842 --> 01:49:05.607]  The fact that they've gone so far down the road to tyranny shows that they're completely illegitimate.
[01:49:05.607 --> 01:49:09.510]  Congress has a 6% to 7% approval rating.
[01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:13.473]  And the police they're trying to put in these armored vehicles are starting to wake up.
[01:49:14.558 --> 01:49:16.099]  To what's happening.
[01:49:16.099 --> 01:49:22.042]  And so the feds are coming saying they're going to save us from the paramilitary police that they set up.
[01:49:22.042 --> 01:49:32.167]  I mean, I don't see any way the establishment's going to be able to win this, Cliven, unless they stage false flags and blame the Liberty Movement.
[01:49:32.167 --> 01:49:34.488]  And I don't think that'll even work as well.
[01:49:34.488 --> 01:49:39.690]  I mean, how does your gut, what does your gut tell you is going to happen in this country?
[01:49:39.690 --> 01:49:41.171]  Where do you see this country in 10 years?
[01:49:41.678 --> 01:49:45.221]  Well, let me talk just a little bit more about what happened out here.
[01:49:45.221 --> 01:49:58.810]  Let's take my son, Dave, that basically he was taking pictures of them moving the cattle, not even in the area where they were gathering it, but going to take pictures of the trucks that had the cattle in it.
[01:49:58.810 --> 01:50:06.856]  And they ganged up on him and their thugs with their high-powered Army military-type equipment.
[01:50:07.569 --> 01:50:28.866]  And they, uh, christened his head into the gravel, and arrested him, and hauled him off, and, uh, took him and put him in their jails, interrogated him, and, uh, after two days, they turned him out on the street, just like a, just like a thug would probably take, uh, somebody that they're gonna rape, and they use him up, use her up, or whatever, and then they just turn her out on the street.
[01:50:28.866 --> 01:50:31.208]  That's the way they treated my son.
[01:50:31.208 --> 01:50:36.572]  And, you know, why would a human being or a government act that way?
[01:50:37.456 --> 01:50:47.166]  The only thing they can be doing is trying to tell we the people that they have unlimited power and authority and they can do any damn thing they want and we better not resist or say anything about it.
[01:50:48.584 --> 01:50:49.485]  That's the attitude.
[01:50:49.485 --> 01:50:52.447]  Cliven Bundy is our guest.
[01:50:52.447 --> 01:50:54.068]  It's called being dishonorable.
[01:50:54.068 --> 01:50:57.230]  And people think that's tough nowadays to act like a thug.
[01:50:57.230 --> 01:50:58.791]  But we'll be back with Cliven Bundy.
[01:50:58.791 --> 01:50:59.852]  Stay with us.
[01:51:14.457 --> 01:51:16.779]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:52:00.334 --> 01:52:05.318]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the waters.
[01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:08.000]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:15.045]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?

[01:52:20.989 --> 01:52:22.991]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:52:22.991 --> 01:52:25.853]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.

[01:53:06.814 --> 01:53:10.135]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.

[01:54:03.797 --> 01:54:05.838]  This show is documented.
[01:54:05.838 --> 01:54:09.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:12.982]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:54:12.982 --> 01:54:17.585]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:54:17.585 --> 01:54:19.526]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:54:20.506 --> 01:54:32.370]  We're back live.
[01:54:32.370 --> 01:54:33.790]  Cliven Bundy is our guest.
[01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:34.811]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:54:34.811 --> 01:54:37.252]  I'll go right to your calls when we start the next hour.
[01:54:37.252 --> 01:54:38.272]  Matthew, Michael.
[01:54:40.253 --> 01:54:44.355]  Jeremy, Matt, just everybody that's patiently holding will go right to you.
[01:54:44.355 --> 01:55:03.326]  But we do have that clip, in case you're a new listener and doubt us, of Senator Harry Reid a few months ago saying the people out there at the Bondi Ranch, most of them demonstrating for the First Amendment, because the feds were saying basically in half the county you couldn't even stand on the sidewalk with a sign that would come up and assault you, that that was terrorism.
[01:55:03.706 --> 01:55:13.909]  And they got video of one guy aiming his AR-15 down over the overpass towards the feds, which I think was stupid and very provocative.
[01:55:13.909 --> 01:55:16.270]  And then they imply everyone's a terrorist because of that.
[01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:26.573]  What about the police aiming their 223s at my reporters in broad daylight, who they even knew by name day after day in Ferguson?
[01:55:26.573 --> 01:55:27.473]  Is that terrorism?
[01:55:30.728 --> 01:55:32.068]  Let's go to that clip of Harry Reid.
[01:55:32.068 --> 01:55:32.729]  Here it is.
[01:55:32.729 --> 01:55:38.251]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[01:55:38.251 --> 01:55:41.172]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[01:55:41.172 --> 01:55:45.013]  And I think that we are a country that people should follow the law.
[01:55:45.013 --> 01:55:47.894]  And what went up in Mesquite is not very good.
[01:55:47.894 --> 01:55:50.835]  I repeat, what went up there is domestic tourism.
[01:55:50.835 --> 01:55:51.696]  Okay.
[01:55:51.696 --> 01:55:56.617]  Domestic terrorism, not tourism.
[01:55:56.617 --> 01:55:58.278]  That was a Las Vegas Review Journal video.
[01:56:00.396 --> 01:56:01.917]  So, there you go.
[01:56:01.917 --> 01:56:04.939]  All of this is for the American people, and that's admitted.
[01:56:04.939 --> 01:56:15.506]  And so they claim that the rendition, the torture, the NDAA, the checkpoints, the NSA was all for Al-Qaeda, which is now known as IS and our government gave weapons to, and is now fighting again.
[01:56:15.506 --> 01:56:23.111]  Because it's not our government, it's criminal special interests at every level who are robbing the country seven ways to Sunday.
[01:56:23.111 --> 01:56:28.314]  There are secret death panels for veterans where they have operable cancers with 95%
[01:56:31.383 --> 01:56:32.204]  Success rates.
[01:56:32.204 --> 01:56:36.067]  And they just don't give them the surgery and they die.
[01:56:36.067 --> 01:56:40.811]  And then the horror media spins that when the alternative media breaks it.
[01:56:40.811 --> 01:56:43.633]  It's going on nationwide as mistakes were made.
[01:56:43.633 --> 01:56:44.834]  No.
[01:56:44.834 --> 01:56:49.398]  The government and criminal interests have gotten away with bloody murder.
[01:56:49.398 --> 01:56:59.327]  And somebody finally stood up to them and the controlled media acted like we were devils for daring to know the law and what had happened out there.
[01:57:00.322 --> 01:57:04.003]  Final comments, Cliven Bunny, in the two minutes we've got left, sir.
[01:57:04.003 --> 01:57:06.584]  Well, you know, the question is, who is the criminals here?
[01:57:06.584 --> 01:57:18.467]  Was it the federal bureaucracy that pointed the gun to the we the people, or was it we the people who stood up for our liberty and freedoms and our agency, our constitution, our state sovereignty?
[01:57:18.467 --> 01:57:20.428]  Was we wrong, or were they wrong?
[01:57:20.428 --> 01:57:24.589]  Where in this constitution, where in this government does it allow
[01:57:25.269 --> 01:57:27.911]  I don't know when we're gonna stop it.
[01:57:27.911 --> 01:57:29.532]  We're gonna have to stand up for
[01:57:53.622 --> 01:58:02.567]  Uh, uh, our state sovereignty, our local sheriff's got to wake up and, uh, and we the people, we, hey, it's our fault.
[01:58:02.567 --> 01:58:04.048]  We have allowed this to happen.
[01:58:04.048 --> 01:58:05.329]  We gotta stop it now.
[01:58:07.534 --> 01:58:13.218]  Well, don't forget Judge Head in Lubbock two years ago said they needed armored vehicles to fight a UN takeover.
[01:58:13.218 --> 01:58:19.423]  I'm not even so much against the locals, if they're patriots, having things to defend the population from drug cartels or whatever.
[01:58:19.423 --> 01:58:22.145]  I'm against federal armaments against the people.
[01:58:22.145 --> 01:58:23.566]  That's unconstitutional.
[01:58:23.566 --> 01:58:25.327]  Here it is out of the Desert News.
[01:58:25.327 --> 01:58:29.890]  Representative Stewart seeking to demilitarize federal regulatory agencies.
[01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:34.033]  The congressman from Utah says he wants to demilitarize the feds.
[01:58:34.033 --> 01:58:36.415]  That's more like it, and that's what's coming out of this.
[01:58:36.815 --> 01:58:38.798]  From Chris Stewart, Republican, Utah.
[01:58:38.798 --> 01:58:40.620]  Cliven Bundy, thank you so much.
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:42.322]  We salute you for defending liberty.
[01:58:42.322 --> 01:58:43.043]  God bless you.
[01:58:43.043 --> 01:58:46.768]  This is ACN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:46.768 --> 01:58:48.070]  That's right, great job.
[01:58:50.598 --> 01:58:51.958]  In the near future.
[01:58:51.958 --> 01:58:56.439]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:58:56.439 --> 01:58:57.660]  Security, alert.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:59.680]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:03.381]  Analysis, InfoWars, building individuals, media operations.
[01:59:03.381 --> 01:59:08.262]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:08.262 --> 01:59:10.843]  Crime directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:13.703]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:13.703 --> 01:59:16.944]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:16.944 --> 01:59:19.225]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:19.225 --> 01:59:20.045]  These people are a threat.
[01:59:20.445 --> 01:59:25.546]  They're never going to stop.
[01:59:25.546 --> 01:59:29.227]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:29.227 --> 01:59:36.529]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[01:59:36.529 --> 01:59:40.810]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[01:59:52.461 --> 01:59:54.849]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.849 --> 01:59:57.618]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.578 --> 02:00:10.403]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:12.004]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.004 --> 02:00:13.546]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.546 --> 02:00:17.750]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:21.814]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.226 --> 02:00:42.648]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:42.648 --> 02:00:46.031]  We're taking your phone calls ahead of a bunch of news I'm going to be covering.
[02:00:46.031 --> 02:00:48.032]  Matthew in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:00:48.032 --> 02:00:49.714]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:49.714 --> 02:00:50.654]  Hello, Alex.
[02:00:50.654 --> 02:00:51.855]  First time caller.
[02:00:51.855 --> 02:00:58.400]  Actually, we met about 19 years ago, but I'm not going to digress into that because I know you got old.
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:58.800]  Interesting.
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.761]  Where did we meet, Michael?
[02:00:59.761 --> 02:01:01.502]  I don't remember it.
[02:01:01.502 --> 02:01:08.167]  Actually, you gave me directions on how to get to Mount Carmel in Waco.
[02:01:10.077 --> 02:01:14.380]  I can't remember who introduced us, but yeah, it's been a gazillion years ago.
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:18.183]  Yeah, we were doing a memorial church there for all those that died.
[02:01:18.183 --> 02:01:24.407]  First it started that we were just going to renovate the little chapel for the memorial, and then it got away from me with my listeners.
[02:01:24.407 --> 02:01:37.157]  We ended up building a church, and then the media said that I was a Branch Davidian trying to conjure the dead spirit of Koresh, when the memorial was also for the ATF people that died, and there was a plaque there.
[02:01:37.937 --> 02:01:41.659]  The mainstream news said it was a celebration of the federal agents being killed.
[02:01:41.659 --> 02:01:43.260]  So that's how mainstream media operates.
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:44.381]  Go ahead.
[02:01:44.381 --> 02:01:44.961]  Okay.
[02:01:44.961 --> 02:01:53.265]  Well, what I thought was a good thing, I work as a chef and I'm also working in a nutrition science degree.
[02:01:53.265 --> 02:01:55.867]  I'm trying to get basically a doctorate in that.
[02:01:57.390 --> 02:02:10.917]  The story that y'all had linked up on Infowars about the school lunch program, which Michelle Obama is a nutritionist as much as Barack Obama is a constitutional lawyer.
[02:02:10.917 --> 02:02:11.677]  Something I wanted to bring up.
[02:02:11.677 --> 02:02:15.319]  I live here in South Carolina, kind of basically between Atlanta and Charlotte.
[02:02:25.302 --> 02:02:35.349]  Something that we did here locally was more or less to get rid of the federal mandate on lunches because everybody figured out that it wasn't working.
[02:02:35.349 --> 02:02:37.771]  The kids weren't eating the stuff.
[02:02:37.771 --> 02:02:41.614]  Yeah, it was racist to bring your lunch in a brown bag or whatever.
[02:02:41.614 --> 02:02:47.578]  And also started trying to locally source as much food as we possibly can.
[02:02:48.388 --> 02:02:57.312]  Yeah, the cost of lunch has essentially doubled this school year, but the misconception that a lot of people are under and a lot of school boards... But it wasn't free!
[02:02:57.312 --> 02:03:01.794]  The feds take our money, send us poison crud back, it's subsidized.
[02:03:01.794 --> 02:03:09.877]  It's like McDonald's is subsidized because they're allowed to have Chinese rotten food that's come out in the news and they're allowed to radiate and they're allowed to not pay for Obamacare.
[02:03:10.197 --> 02:03:16.899]  When you go eat their food, you are literally eating food that's subsidized and is globalist garbage.
[02:03:16.899 --> 02:03:20.639]  And McDonald's, I was thinking, is the perfect microcosm.
[02:03:20.639 --> 02:03:25.721]  The globalists have set it up where they're going to make you so poor, you can only afford to eat there.
[02:03:25.721 --> 02:03:31.442]  Where their hamburger is a dollar or two dollars, and a real hamburger is five dollars or six dollars.
[02:03:32.603 --> 02:03:38.328]  It's just, you won't have the money in the future to eat anywhere but McDonald's.
[02:03:38.328 --> 02:03:45.874]  And then it'll be social engineering, subsidized poison, because the globalists exempted themselves from all the regulations.
[02:03:45.874 --> 02:03:48.175]  That's the essence of how they operate.
[02:03:48.175 --> 02:03:50.657]  If someone can understand that, they can understand it all.
[02:03:50.657 --> 02:03:51.258]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:03:52.585 --> 02:03:54.366]  No, no problem.
[02:03:54.366 --> 02:04:17.072]  But I've thought there's been a lot of good points brought up today in your show that you know people you know just talking about little steps that people can make and I think this is one that people really need to you know the push in local government you know be it with your school board or whatever your Absolutely, because the next step is like Denver or Chicago where the Democrats say now you can't pack your own lunch.
[02:04:19.294 --> 02:04:21.496]  Now you can't send it.
[02:04:21.496 --> 02:04:23.717]  I mean, next you can't pack your child's lunch.
[02:04:23.717 --> 02:04:26.159]  I mean, think about how screwed up that is.
[02:04:26.159 --> 02:04:30.382]  And Chicago said two years ago, they said, listen, we can't trust these parents to pack a lunch.
[02:04:30.382 --> 02:04:33.924]  See, that's what they think of us.
[02:04:33.924 --> 02:04:34.384]  Great points.
[02:04:34.384 --> 02:04:37.466]  I mean, I grew up with a lunch.
[02:04:37.466 --> 02:04:38.327]  My mom packed her.
[02:04:38.327 --> 02:04:40.368]  I packed myself my entire life.
[02:04:40.368 --> 02:04:46.933]  Well, back when you were a kid, back when you were a kid, you didn't have all these allergies that GMO is triggering.
[02:04:47.722 --> 02:04:49.483]  I mean, pretty soon there won't be anything people can eat.
[02:04:49.483 --> 02:04:51.204]  What's the other point?
[02:04:51.204 --> 02:04:56.968]  Okay, um, Trey Gowdy, my representative here, who's investigating the Benghazi thing... I want to hear about it.
[02:04:56.968 --> 02:04:57.308]  Stay there.
[02:04:57.308 --> 02:04:57.688]  Don't hang up.
[02:04:57.688 --> 02:04:58.429]  I'm gonna come back to Matthew.
[02:04:59.966 --> 02:05:03.627]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.627 --> 02:05:07.889]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:07.889 --> 02:05:09.689]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:09.689 --> 02:05:17.532]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:17.532 --> 02:05:18.673]  But for how long?
[02:05:18.673 --> 02:05:25.315]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:25.315 --> 02:05:28.136]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:05:30.026 --> 02:05:37.328]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[02:05:59.491 --> 02:06:05.635]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:06:05.635 --> 02:06:08.917]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:06:08.917 --> 02:06:10.698]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[02:06:10.698 --> 02:06:17.062]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:17.062 --> 02:06:22.966]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security, uh, sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:06:23.126 --> 02:06:27.068]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:06:27.068 --> 02:06:30.130]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:06:30.130 --> 02:06:38.435]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:06:38.435 --> 02:06:40.516]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:06:40.516 --> 02:06:41.577]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:06:41.917 --> 02:06:50.886]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:06:59.423 --> 02:07:00.684]  Another major health threat.
[02:07:00.684 --> 02:07:05.646]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:05.646 --> 02:07:08.327]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:08.327 --> 02:07:15.370]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:15.370 --> 02:07:18.351]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:18.351 --> 02:07:21.312]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:21.312 --> 02:07:23.333]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:23.333 --> 02:07:26.214]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:26.254 --> 02:07:31.977]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:35.479]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:35.479 --> 02:07:38.580]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:07:57.550 --> 02:08:15.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:31.323 --> 02:08:41.287]  It wasn't very long ago that the governor of California was outlawing driver's licenses for people who are undocumented from Mexico.
[02:08:41.287 --> 02:08:43.068]  That's not the law anymore.
[02:08:43.068 --> 02:08:47.710]  If you got a car or a truck, it takes you two or three hours to get across.
[02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:49.771]  So we can change that.
[02:08:49.771 --> 02:08:56.754]  And we are going to work on a plan so you can go from Tijuana or Mexico to California in 20 minutes.
[02:08:56.754 --> 02:08:57.755]  That's what I want to do.
[02:09:02.157 --> 02:09:19.869]  With full respect to the sovereignty of the United States, we want to contribute and support agreements that would make immigration reform a reality, because at the end of the day, this is about justice that is very important for the development of North American society.
[02:09:19.869 --> 02:09:22.251]  North American society.
[02:09:23.812 --> 02:09:38.165]  That is the Mexican president who resides over a failed narcotics trafficking terror state that is in full collapse with the rest of Central America already collapsed.
[02:09:38.165 --> 02:09:41.869]  They have now developed a corridor into the United States.
[02:09:41.869 --> 02:09:45.772]  Obama has announced unlimited amnesty for Guatemalans.
[02:09:45.772 --> 02:09:47.954]  Enough green cards.
[02:09:48.749 --> 02:09:53.511]  for Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala's entire populations.
[02:09:53.511 --> 02:10:04.937]  There's a new Pew poll out showing that one-third of Mexicans are ready to come here now and believe it's their right to come here and have free babies, welfare, everything.
[02:10:04.937 --> 02:10:17.864]  And Jerry Brown, with a straight face and a big giant red nose, it looks like he's an alcoholic Santa Claus, says, wasn't too long ago we had governors.
[02:10:19.042 --> 02:10:23.727]  That didn't give driver's license to illegals!
[02:10:23.727 --> 02:10:24.408]  Think about that.
[02:10:24.408 --> 02:10:27.572]  Can I go to Mexico and get a driver's license?
[02:10:27.572 --> 02:10:28.473]  No.
[02:10:28.473 --> 02:10:30.455]  Can I go there and have everything paid for free?
[02:10:30.455 --> 02:10:30.755]  No.
[02:10:34.445 --> 02:10:38.269]  Imagine if I showed up and said, it is justice that you pay for me.
[02:10:38.269 --> 02:10:39.850]  It is justice.
[02:10:39.850 --> 02:10:44.115]  It is justice that I get a driver's license so I can open bank accounts and so I can vote.
[02:10:44.115 --> 02:10:48.038]  Because see, notice they have laws in California where you got a driver's license, you can vote.
[02:10:48.038 --> 02:10:50.701]  You get on the rolls.
[02:10:50.701 --> 02:10:52.223]  I mean, what a sick joke.
[02:10:52.223 --> 02:10:55.266]  I mean, literally, California could take over all of America.
[02:10:55.266 --> 02:10:57.188]  They could just bring in 300 million people.
[02:10:58.530 --> 02:11:04.396]  From the world, I don't even need that, 10, 20, 30 million, enough to tip the other balance with populous states like Texas.
[02:11:04.396 --> 02:11:12.784]  The Democrats say with their blue plan, and I'm not even a fan of Republicans, but the Republican leadership wants to commit suicide as well for the North American Union.
[02:11:12.784 --> 02:11:15.988]  That's what this is all about is a North American Union.
[02:11:15.988 --> 02:11:19.071]  That's why you've got Obama and you've got
[02:11:20.336 --> 02:11:32.902]  Hillary Clinton, and you've got all these other world leaders, and Wesley Clark, and Petraeus, all the news saying it's a North American Union, we're going to have a North American Union ID card.
[02:11:32.902 --> 02:11:36.344]  Six years ago, they came out with a North American Union ID card.
[02:11:36.824 --> 02:11:42.005]  A hemispheric travel card that if you get it from Mexico to Canada or the US, you can travel everywhere.
[02:11:42.005 --> 02:11:42.986]  A smart card.
[02:11:42.986 --> 02:11:47.187]  That's going to be the new card and citizens will have to have it to get on an airplane.
[02:11:47.187 --> 02:11:49.947]  But illegals, remember that headline last week?
[02:11:49.947 --> 02:11:54.148]  Don't have to have any ID to fly.
[02:11:54.148 --> 02:11:56.629]  Lawless, selective enforcement.
[02:12:00.851 --> 02:12:11.659]  And you can be a felon from around the world and come here and change your name as many times as you want, kill as many people as you want, and you do not get in trouble compared to anybody else.
[02:12:11.659 --> 02:12:17.864]  Imagine the straight face of, yeah, I used to, you had to, you know, at least be here legally to get a driver's license.
[02:12:17.864 --> 02:12:19.785]  Now it's just, no.
[02:12:19.785 --> 02:12:22.928]  Can you believe the undocumented couldn't get a driver's license?
[02:12:29.454 --> 02:12:37.299]  And of course, then the judges on record, when you have that driver's license, in places like Colorado and California, just let the illegals go.
[02:12:37.299 --> 02:12:47.246]  I've had prosecutors from Travis County, who are not like the people that indicted Perry, come to me and meet with me and show me the numbers.
[02:12:51.471 --> 02:13:00.761]  And talk about the fact that judges are told by the higher-ups to tell the cops, don't arrest illegals for drunk driving and stuff, because all we're going to give them is a $10 fine.
[02:13:00.761 --> 02:13:03.264]  Because if we don't, they'll walk.
[02:13:03.264 --> 02:13:04.926]  $10, $20 they'll pay.
[02:13:04.926 --> 02:13:07.308]  Citizens, the average DWI cost is about $20,000.
[02:13:07.308 --> 02:13:07.649]  Unillegal, $10.
[02:13:07.649 --> 02:13:07.809]  Maybe $20.
[02:13:14.403 --> 02:13:18.085]  And hey, see, but discrimination's only by white people.
[02:13:18.085 --> 02:13:20.447]  You don't accept Obamacare, you're a racist gringo.
[02:13:20.447 --> 02:13:23.589]  You don't accept turning your guns in, you're a racist gringo.
[02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:26.771]  You don't accept your kids being given forced inoculations.
[02:13:26.771 --> 02:13:30.113]  Look, if the sun don't shine, it's a white person's fault.
[02:13:30.113 --> 02:13:36.157]  Just on and on and on and on in this quote minority-based propaganda.
[02:13:36.157 --> 02:13:38.639]  But see, the minorities are the majority now in almost every state.
[02:13:39.876 --> 02:13:41.597]  And did the white bashing stop?
[02:13:41.597 --> 02:13:48.102]  No, it's only intensified because the government is manipulating this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:48.102 --> 02:13:54.707]  To tell the immigrants that have, I guess, what could you call it?
[02:13:54.707 --> 02:14:00.311]  An idea that people don't like them or that they're not as good or they're better and they're going to show you.
[02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:05.633]  And they're teamed up with the big, mighty government now, so they're going to win.
[02:14:05.633 --> 02:14:07.994]  That's childlike thinking.
[02:14:07.994 --> 02:14:09.455]  Obama's my daddy.
[02:14:09.455 --> 02:14:10.736]  George Bush is my daddy.
[02:14:10.736 --> 02:14:20.283]  I remember Republicans just associating their personal power with the far-off, powerful government and psychology.
[02:14:20.283 --> 02:14:25.788]  But those very same people will hate their neighbor that's super good-looking or has a gorgeous wife.
[02:14:25.788 --> 02:14:31.432]  They will hate their neighbor that makes more money, legally and lawfully, than them, and will have existential envy.
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:43.990]  When you study advertising and you study modern culture and propaganda and Edward Bernays and Joseph Goebbels, they talk about existential envy.
[02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:53.558]  That I grew up researching and understanding, but when you try to do research on it, there's hardly any literature on it.
[02:14:53.558 --> 02:14:59.344]  Max Schiller was a German philosopher known for his work in
[02:15:02.105 --> 02:15:05.407]  Ethics and philosophy and anthropology.
[02:15:05.407 --> 02:15:14.672]  He developed further the psychological method and is one of the main founders of modern psychology today.
[02:15:14.672 --> 02:15:23.377]  And what did he talk about?
[02:15:23.377 --> 02:15:24.318]  Max Schiller
[02:15:25.876 --> 02:15:35.363]  Said, quote, existential envy, which is directed against the other person's very nature, is the strongest source of resentment.
[02:15:37.603 --> 02:15:50.454]  It is as if it whispers continually, I can forgive everything, but not that you are, that you are what you are, that I am not what you are, indeed, that I am not you.
[02:15:50.454 --> 02:16:02.325]  This form of envy strips the opponent of his very existence, for the existence as such is felt to be a pressure, a reproach, and an unbearable humiliation.
[02:16:03.789 --> 02:16:18.552]  In the lives of great men there are always critical periods of instability in which they are alternatively envy and try to love those whose merits they cannot but esteem.
[02:16:18.552 --> 02:16:23.013]  Only gradually one of these attitudes will predominate.
[02:16:23.013 --> 02:16:30.474]  Here lies the meaning of Goethe's reflection that against another's great
[02:16:33.217 --> 02:16:42.585]  Merits, there is no remedy but love.
[02:16:42.585 --> 02:16:49.750]  Gota had it right and this is what it comes down to.
[02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:52.733]  Of everything I've learned, we'll go back to your calls.
[02:16:52.733 --> 02:16:56.235]  Existential envy drives everything.
[02:16:56.235 --> 02:17:01.560]  Back when I was 20 years old, I was about as good looking as it gets.
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:01.700]  And
[02:17:03.422 --> 02:17:07.906]  I could have the most beautiful girlfriends out there.
[02:17:07.906 --> 02:17:14.692]  Models, professional cheerleaders, you name it, I've dated them all.
[02:17:14.692 --> 02:17:16.594]  Showgirls.
[02:17:16.594 --> 02:17:19.316]  Then I got into politics and finally the Lord didn't care about myself.
[02:17:19.316 --> 02:17:21.138]  Didn't work out for 15 years, turned into the job of the hut.
[02:17:21.138 --> 02:17:23.500]  It's been a slow process getting back to the way I used to look.
[02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:24.141]  Take a long time.
[02:17:25.128 --> 02:17:26.569]  But I'm losing weight as people can see.
[02:17:26.569 --> 02:17:37.616]  The point is that I would have these incredibly gorgeous girlfriends and then they would get mad when I worked out so much out of six-pack stomach saying, I don't want you looking better than me.
[02:17:37.616 --> 02:17:47.582]  And it's a more modern phenomenon as existential envy gets worse that women especially don't want a mate that is smart and intelligent and dynamic and successful.
[02:17:47.582 --> 02:17:48.363]  They want a mate.
[02:17:48.363 --> 02:17:49.363]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[02:17:49.363 --> 02:17:50.084]  This is so important.
[02:17:51.693 --> 02:17:56.315]  That they feel better than because they have a low self-esteem.
[02:17:56.315 --> 02:18:01.657]  And failed societies have a predominance of existential envy.
[02:18:01.657 --> 02:18:04.078]  And the government and the media plays off of this.
[02:18:04.078 --> 02:18:07.600]  The classism, the statism, the racism.
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:15.583]  To where people are so upset that they will politically be the slaves of the Democratic Party and do whatever they say.
[02:18:15.583 --> 02:18:20.085]  Turn in their guns, have checkpoints in their neighborhoods, accept Obamacare as a giant screwjob.
[02:18:21.198 --> 02:18:34.832]  Because misery loves company and just to imagine success and imagine being a good person is just too much because they hate all the people that are charming, that are good-looking.
[02:18:34.832 --> 02:18:35.873]  And I experienced that.
[02:18:35.873 --> 02:18:43.341]  I wasn't bragging when I said I was super good-looking and, you know, had all these gorgeous girlfriends, which, by the way, wasn't fun at the end of the day because they were so empty.
[02:18:48.143 --> 02:18:59.050]  It was the experience of wondering why so many people disliked me because I was good looking and because I was charming and because I was nice.
[02:18:59.050 --> 02:19:12.279]  Now I was always popular and always had a great time and I would run into people that were successful and who loved and admired those that were better looking than them or smarter than them because on the scale of 1 to 10 I was nothing.
[02:19:14.383 --> 02:19:17.769]  That's why I've been successful being around rich and powerful people.
[02:19:17.769 --> 02:19:19.812]  Not that I've even tried to be around them.
[02:19:19.812 --> 02:19:22.256]  It's because I don't envy them.
[02:19:22.256 --> 02:19:24.420]  And I don't hate them because they're successful.
[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:25.462]  And I'm not fake.
[02:19:26.687 --> 02:19:34.356]  And I'm real, and I can admire someone who's a rocket scientist, or I can admire someone who's a better comet than I am.
[02:19:34.356 --> 02:19:44.569]  I can admire a man who's more manly and good-looking than I am, and looks like a GQ model, and who has an incredibly gorgeous, you know, fitness model girlfriend.
[02:19:45.615 --> 02:19:50.977]  Because I admire beautiful, smart humans and the human species.
[02:19:50.977 --> 02:19:59.941]  And subconsciously, I imagine my grandchildren being with their grandchildren as adults and colonizing space together.
[02:19:59.941 --> 02:20:01.061]  I admire.
[02:20:01.061 --> 02:20:09.364]  I mean, it'd be like going to a horse show and seeing beautiful horses and being mad that one horse was more beautiful or strong than the other.
[02:20:09.364 --> 02:20:12.826]  It gives strength to the entire species of the horse.
[02:20:14.878 --> 02:20:19.145]  And so if you want to know the secret of success, it's don't be an envious little wicked weirdo.
[02:20:20.367 --> 02:20:34.339]  I can't tell you how many people that I saw had some talent or smart or had an eye for news that I would try to elevate, who would then immediately try to destroy me, make stuff up about me, lie about me, and just go completely nuts.
[02:20:34.339 --> 02:20:41.285]  But it was existential envy believing that I had to be destroyed so that they could rise.
[02:20:41.285 --> 02:20:45.289]  And they were trying to be, quote, media stars, not to defeat the enemy.
[02:20:46.772 --> 02:20:56.839]  But to be stars, to be egomaniacs, and that's why none of them last, because they're not doing it for the love of liberty, for the love of the truth.
[02:20:56.839 --> 02:20:59.381]  They're not doing it to build others up.
[02:20:59.381 --> 02:21:12.631]  I can't tell you how many countless guests and other talk show hosts and authors and researchers that I've had on this show who literally later say, you need me, that's why you have me on,
[02:21:14.932 --> 02:21:15.994]  You're using me.
[02:21:15.994 --> 02:21:19.401]  You're posting my articles when I make somebody famous or successful.
[02:21:19.401 --> 02:21:22.346]  And then later they learn they're nobody after I quit promoting them.
[02:21:22.346 --> 02:21:23.028]  Which is sad.
[02:21:26.351 --> 02:21:30.073]  But they literally can't imagine someone trying to build them up.
[02:21:30.073 --> 02:21:31.294]  We have more listeners.
[02:21:31.294 --> 02:21:34.936]  We have the ratings from our stations that come in live time now.
[02:21:34.936 --> 02:21:36.937]  We have the ratings off the internet live time.
[02:21:36.937 --> 02:21:38.478]  You know what gets the listeners?
[02:21:38.478 --> 02:21:38.678]  Me.
[02:21:38.678 --> 02:21:40.198]  You know what people want to hear?
[02:21:40.198 --> 02:21:41.579]  Alex Jones.
[02:21:41.579 --> 02:21:46.622]  I don't have all these guests and people up here because I'm just trying to get ratings and listeners.
[02:21:46.622 --> 02:21:48.463]  I'm getting them up here because I like to talk to them.
[02:21:48.763 --> 02:21:50.004]  I want to pick their brain.
[02:21:50.004 --> 02:21:51.325]  I want to build them up.
[02:21:51.325 --> 02:21:53.507]  I want to point out how smart they are.
[02:21:53.507 --> 02:22:11.560]  And so many of these existential envy weirdos think I'm weak and that I'm trying to screw them over because they can't imagine that someone would try to build humanity up and be strong.
[02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:15.243]  I admire a man who has a knockout gorgeous wife.
[02:22:16.394 --> 02:22:25.681]  And who has great kids and is successful and can hold it together and to see their kids graduate from college and be honorable.
[02:22:25.681 --> 02:22:33.446]  Even if a war is a fraud and a lie, I could admire somebody that serves four or five tours and goes through living hell and keeps it together.
[02:22:33.446 --> 02:22:35.788]  I'm not intimidated by men that are tougher than me.
[02:22:35.788 --> 02:22:38.670]  I'm not intimidated by artists that can paint a better painting than I.
[02:22:40.239 --> 02:22:42.560]  I admire them.
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:44.121]  I fancy humans.
[02:22:44.121 --> 02:22:47.223]  I fancy the species.
[02:22:47.223 --> 02:22:48.784]  I want to build people up.
[02:22:48.784 --> 02:22:50.845]  I don't get jealous.
[02:22:50.845 --> 02:22:56.769]  I don't get envious.
[02:22:56.769 --> 02:23:00.711]  Now there's territorialism and people are trying to run me over and dominate me.
[02:23:00.711 --> 02:23:03.353]  Then I stand up against them.
[02:23:03.353 --> 02:23:06.134]  But it's because of the principle.
[02:23:06.134 --> 02:23:06.875]  So I want to read
[02:23:09.079 --> 02:23:14.603]  Max Schiller's, one of the founders of psychology's quote on what drives everything.
[02:23:14.603 --> 02:23:28.254]  And what the system wants is to be base, dumbed down, petty, narcissistic, sociopathoids, artificially created sociopaths is what the system's going for.
[02:23:28.254 --> 02:23:32.157]  Because if you won't stand up for anybody around you, no one's gonna stand up for you.
[02:23:32.157 --> 02:23:37.481]  All these sociopaths and narcissists think they're getting ahead in the world
[02:23:38.962 --> 02:23:45.257]  Because they don't care about anybody and they're screwing everyone and they think that's a real smart having an attitude.
[02:23:45.257 --> 02:23:46.880]  No, that's how you die alone.
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:48.223]  That's how you die without honor.
[02:23:49.693 --> 02:23:59.835]  Honor is knowing humanity's fallen, and knowing you're fallen, but reaching for your higher angels, reaching for the stars, doing what's right, trying to build other people up.
[02:23:59.835 --> 02:24:06.477]  I don't get up here and brag about how I've been successful, or how I understand how things work, because it's about my ego.
[02:24:06.477 --> 02:24:10.018]  It's about telling people, we know where the good water well is.
[02:24:11.223 --> 02:24:12.604]  Versus the poison well.
[02:24:12.604 --> 02:24:13.945]  We know the paradigm.
[02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:15.627]  We know how the system works.
[02:24:15.627 --> 02:24:16.868]  We've decoded it.
[02:24:16.868 --> 02:24:18.369]  It's hiding in plain view.
[02:24:18.369 --> 02:24:22.032]  We do have the answers.
[02:24:22.032 --> 02:24:24.535]  The answer is you waking up and taking action.
[02:24:24.535 --> 02:24:28.198]  The answer is you getting back what the founding fathers were into.
[02:24:28.198 --> 02:24:29.239]  Invention.
[02:24:29.239 --> 02:24:30.219]  Trailblazing.
[02:24:30.219 --> 02:24:31.180]  Being honorable.
[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:32.081]  Being strong.
[02:24:32.081 --> 02:24:33.302]  Being tough.
[02:24:33.302 --> 02:24:33.943]  Being real.
[02:24:35.213 --> 02:24:38.257]  The most valuable thing is your name, is your honor.
[02:24:38.257 --> 02:24:48.489]  That's why the system tries to dishonor me all day, and say I'm dishonorable, and say I'm not real, and say I'm a fraud, because they got my phones tapped, they got my police records from the time I was 12 years old.
[02:24:48.489 --> 02:24:52.194]  They know full well how real I am, and that's what they don't like.
[02:24:53.561 --> 02:24:55.963]  They don't like bonafides, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:55.963 --> 02:25:00.027]  And let me tell you what really successful people who aren't evil, what they're looking for.
[02:25:00.027 --> 02:25:17.203]  They're looking for a few good men and women who are honorable, who are savvy, who are strong, who are ready to stand up for justice, who are ready to stand up for freedom, and who value being real, and who value other people's success just as much or more as their own.
[02:25:22.822 --> 02:25:27.245]  Existential envy is our enemy.
[02:25:27.245 --> 02:25:32.829]  And I will read to you again the definition of it by the man who invented the term.
[02:25:32.829 --> 02:25:40.534]  Existential envy, which is directed against the other person's very nature, is the strongest source of resentment.
[02:25:40.534 --> 02:25:48.339]  It is, as if it whispers continually, I can forgive everything but not that you are.
[02:25:48.339 --> 02:25:49.880]  That you are what you are,
[02:25:51.013 --> 02:25:53.955]  That I am not what you are.
[02:25:53.955 --> 02:25:56.116]  Indeed, that I am not you.
[02:25:56.116 --> 02:25:59.858]  This form of envy strips the opponent of their very existence.
[02:25:59.858 --> 02:26:01.199]  Dehumanized.
[02:26:01.199 --> 02:26:09.364]  For this existence as such is felt to be a pressure, a reproach, an unbearable humiliation.
[02:26:09.364 --> 02:26:19.470]  In the lives of great men, there are always critical periods of instability in which they alternatively envy and try to love those whose merits they cannot but esteem.
[02:26:19.470 --> 02:26:20.391]  Only gradually,
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:23.584]  One of these attitudes will predominate.
[02:26:23.584 --> 02:26:30.838]  Here lies the meaning of Goethe's reflection that against another's great merits there is no remedy but love.
[02:26:30.838 --> 02:26:31.199]  That's right.
[02:26:34.332 --> 02:26:36.133]  And I sort of noticed this as a child.
[02:26:36.133 --> 02:26:54.246]  If there was somebody winning the football game that we were playing, or someone that could draw better, or someone who could do better math, or some girl that was more cute than somebody else's girlfriend, they would always announce, yeah, but their parents are getting divorced, and she's got eczema, or she's a loser, or no.
[02:26:54.246 --> 02:26:59.750]  I would always hear losers announce the imminent downfall of anyone who was more successful than them.
[02:26:59.750 --> 02:27:03.753]  Always announce how the person had failed and how they had won.
[02:27:06.127 --> 02:27:13.600]  Instead of just going, wow, that person can really play football, or wow, that girl's really beautiful, or wow, great man, how do you do math like that?
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:17.106]  Where is the shared celebration like life?
[02:27:17.106 --> 02:27:18.369]  It's a giant party.
[02:27:22.088 --> 02:27:27.551]  Out under the trees in the forest, a big feast with everybody dancing around, celebrating.
[02:27:27.551 --> 02:27:43.621]  Somebody's not a good dancer, they fall on their butt in front of everyone, everybody laughs lovingly while they're the greatest dancer of the night for getting up there, up on the table with their big cup of ale and dancing, dancing for humanity.
[02:27:43.621 --> 02:27:48.044]  Instead of just sitting around, and that's why I talked about this today and we're going to break, come back with your calls.
[02:27:49.175 --> 02:28:02.018]  The reason I brought up existential envy today is because if you look at the globalist, as above so below, to use their alchemist maxim, it's the New World Order that's envious.
[02:28:02.018 --> 02:28:11.901]  It's the unhappy royal queens and kings 170 years ago, 160 years ago, mad at the beautiful maidens, mad at the strong
[02:28:15.225 --> 02:28:21.389]  Knights and soldiers and shipbuilders and captains and sailors.
[02:28:21.389 --> 02:28:28.074]  Mad that they were living, they were humanity, they were strength, they were competition, not the degradated inbred failure.
[02:28:28.074 --> 02:28:34.558]  And so they developed science to make themselves God and to make us ugly in their existential envy.
[02:28:36.616 --> 02:28:49.746]  And that's why they have human sacrifice for the commoners, and why they try to dumb us down, every sick inbred elite that comes to power, because they have total existential envy of whoever is more beautiful than them.
[02:28:49.746 --> 02:28:51.968]  And we see this in all the fairy tales.
[02:28:51.968 --> 02:28:55.391]  Snow White is just a rewrite of a bunch of German fairy tales.
[02:28:56.587 --> 02:29:02.010]  Or the Queen is angry at the young maiden who's more beautiful than her.
[02:29:02.010 --> 02:29:17.997]  Anybody that's lived knows how evil some women get if they don't mature when they get older and how obsessed and vain and wicked they become because they have existential envy of other women and young men as well because they don't think they can have them anymore.
[02:29:17.997 --> 02:29:19.418]  Or the existential envy
[02:29:21.425 --> 02:29:24.668]  That you see manifesting at every level of society.
[02:29:24.668 --> 02:29:28.152]  That's why they put cancer viruses on our vaccine and fluoride in our water.
[02:29:28.152 --> 02:29:32.516]  So they can sit back and laugh and know that they literally stunted us.
[02:29:32.516 --> 02:29:37.561]  But even through our stunted haze, we have seen beyond the mountaintops.
[02:29:37.561 --> 02:29:39.984]  There's nothing more stunted than trying to hold people back.
[02:29:40.512 --> 02:29:44.797]  You are failures, you are damned to hell, and you know it!
[02:29:44.797 --> 02:29:50.663]  And I declare the victory of humanity through God's promise against your blasphemy against humanity!
[02:29:50.663 --> 02:29:52.646]  You will fall!
[02:29:52.646 --> 02:29:57.211]  Our victory is 100% assured and already set in destiny!
[02:30:00.538 --> 02:30:06.687]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:30:06.687 --> 02:30:11.254]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:30:11.254 --> 02:30:15.821]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:30:16.221 --> 02:30:19.142]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:30:19.142 --> 02:30:24.583]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:30:24.583 --> 02:30:31.965]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[02:30:31.965 --> 02:30:36.106]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:30:36.106 --> 02:30:40.887]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:41.227 --> 02:30:49.691]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:30:49.691 --> 02:30:54.113]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:31:17.084 --> 02:31:19.405]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[02:31:29.850 --> 02:31:33.512]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:33.512 --> 02:31:37.795]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:37.795 --> 02:31:39.576]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:39.576 --> 02:31:47.440]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:48.581]  But for how long?
[02:31:48.581 --> 02:31:55.225]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:31:55.225 --> 02:31:58.027]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:31:59.403 --> 02:32:06.565]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:32:06.565 --> 02:32:08.906]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:32:08.906 --> 02:32:14.188]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:32:14.188 --> 02:32:19.370]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:22.391]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:32:22.691 --> 02:32:26.754]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:32:26.754 --> 02:32:31.078]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:32:31.078 --> 02:32:41.306]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[02:32:41.306 --> 02:32:43.828]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:32:43.968 --> 02:32:44.268]  Waging War!
[02:33:09.836 --> 02:33:12.437]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:12.437 --> 02:33:14.138]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:14.138 --> 02:33:18.681]  So what does the culture sell?
[02:33:18.681 --> 02:33:20.462]  Existential ending.
[02:33:20.462 --> 02:33:25.024]  But the minute you can admire
[02:33:38.052 --> 02:33:44.855]  And the minute you can love others, is the minute other healthy people will open up to you.
[02:33:44.855 --> 02:33:56.300]  And I know I'm saying things that are common sense to those of you out there that are not absolutely dominated by existential envy.
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:58.261]  Praise God you're not!
[02:33:58.261 --> 02:34:05.904]  But this is the driving force in culture, and what they're bombarding the youth with, what they are marinating the women in,
[02:34:06.943 --> 02:34:12.226]  What they are dominating the men with, this is the problem.
[02:34:12.226 --> 02:34:31.479]  Women, especially as they get old, are supposed to take on loving their grandkids and great-grandkids, taking care of the men that usually die before them, working in the garden, painting, becoming fulfilled, being sage, sages to their families with their wisdom.
[02:34:32.284 --> 02:34:40.111]  But if a woman doesn't go on the path of wisdom early, just like a man, they will become a truly wicked, hateful creature.
[02:34:40.111 --> 02:34:43.153]  And all of us face these challenges.
[02:34:43.153 --> 02:34:45.115]  I've become meaner as I get older.
[02:34:45.115 --> 02:34:48.678]  I've become more frustrated because I'm smarter.
[02:34:48.678 --> 02:34:51.621]  I see things clearer.
[02:34:51.621 --> 02:34:54.003]  I've got to work on not becoming a mean old man.
[02:34:57.014 --> 02:34:59.716]  So I'm not up here judging anybody.
[02:34:59.716 --> 02:35:07.940]  I'm just breaking down the fact that existential envy is the big problem.
[02:35:07.940 --> 02:35:21.528]  I've seen people destroy their careers, make stuff up, do incredibly horrible things, things that are even bad for their businesses, bad for their pocketbooks, bad, immoral, just so they can try to defeat someone like a villain in a movie.
[02:35:21.528 --> 02:35:25.671]  When I was a kid growing up, I'd watch villains in movies and cartoons, these powerful archetypes.
[02:35:26.789 --> 02:35:28.409]  And I think, how ridiculous?
[02:35:28.409 --> 02:35:44.213]  Why would the witch be mad that she wasn't invited to the birthday party for Sleeping Beauty so she takes over the whole kingdom and basically puts everybody into a trance when she never even asked to be invited?
[02:35:44.213 --> 02:35:45.553]  It doesn't matter.
[02:35:45.553 --> 02:35:54.875]  The wicked witch didn't like seeing people having a good time and wanted to screw things up and poison the well.
[02:35:54.875 --> 02:35:55.655]  That's what they do.
[02:35:57.833 --> 02:36:04.197]  And they get a thrill out of running our lives.
[02:36:04.197 --> 02:36:15.024]  Then you got just the run-of-the-mill control freaks that are scared of everything and get a thrill out of running everybody's lives and sometimes there's good instincts behind that, but that can be twisted to the enemy's
[02:36:16.483 --> 02:36:17.684]  Ames.
[02:36:17.684 --> 02:36:18.805]  Enough of me ranting about that.
[02:36:18.805 --> 02:36:22.328]  I'm going to go through all the calls that are on hold, then into this stack of news.
[02:36:22.328 --> 02:36:29.333]  By the way, Rick Perry, again, who I'm not falling in love with or anything, Rick Perry's been on the show and called me a big, fat, ugly hog before.
[02:36:29.333 --> 02:36:30.534]  I guess it was kind of true.
[02:36:30.534 --> 02:36:37.460]  And I've said he should get in big trouble for Gardasil lying and saying it was the law to take it.
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:39.642]  All because he got convinced by Merck it was good for people.
[02:36:39.642 --> 02:36:42.644]  When we brought him the documents, it was killing people in the trials.
[02:36:42.644 --> 02:36:44.385]  They say that's what really hurts is presidential chances.
[02:36:46.636 --> 02:36:51.739]  But Rick Perry has tried to not let the BLM take land, and he has actually put the state police on the border.
[02:36:51.739 --> 02:36:55.101]  And so for those sins, the Democrats have indicted him for doing his job.
[02:36:55.101 --> 02:37:04.768]  I mean, that's what you're supposed to do is veto funding for a state agency that is implemented by the county when it's run by a psycho drunk woman who indicts the wrong people.
[02:37:04.768 --> 02:37:14.554]  I have a friend whose brother was indicted by her, and when they brought Rosemary Lindbergh the documents and said, number one, these are two brothers that look a lot alike, number two,
[02:37:16.189 --> 02:37:19.433]  The people claiming that Sid Steiner jumped out with a gun.
[02:37:19.433 --> 02:37:21.895]  He was not even in the city when that happened.
[02:37:21.895 --> 02:37:23.557]  And Shane Steiner didn't even do that.
[02:37:23.557 --> 02:37:25.860]  We have witnesses.
[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:29.944]  The people just thought they could get some money from rich people.
[02:37:29.944 --> 02:37:33.488]  Some of the richest people around here.
[02:37:33.488 --> 02:37:35.451]  And she said basically she didn't care.
[02:37:37.935 --> 02:37:43.820]  And the indictment stood, and then they had to go to the grand jury and get them to make a big noise before it got dropped.
[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:51.286]  She knew that it was Shane Steiner, who's been a guest on the show, we go shooting with him, who I went to high school with.
[02:37:51.286 --> 02:38:01.095]  She knew that Tommy Shane Steiner was the one that had the altercation in front of his house.
[02:38:01.095 --> 02:38:03.317]  And she was going to go ahead with trying to put Sid
[02:38:05.054 --> 02:38:14.705]  Steiner, world champion steer wrestler, people might know the name, in prison for a decade knowing he was innocent.
[02:38:14.705 --> 02:38:23.294]  This is a woman who makes goblin faces and screams and points her finger like she's going to shoot cops when she's in jail, kicking her feet and literally flopping around.
[02:38:23.294 --> 02:38:25.016]  And Rick Perry says, you got to step down.
[02:38:25.016 --> 02:38:26.258]  And they have indicted him.
[02:38:28.186 --> 02:38:31.547]  And I think we should get Shane and Sid in here and actually have them tell that testimony.
[02:38:31.547 --> 02:38:33.827]  I know they're friends with Rick Perry, too.
[02:38:33.827 --> 02:38:35.427]  And so people understand.
[02:38:35.427 --> 02:38:38.688]  They arrested her right by Shane's house, by the way.
[02:38:38.688 --> 02:38:41.809]  Over there at Skyner Ranch.
[02:38:41.809 --> 02:38:44.309]  Driving on the wrong side of the road.
[02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:46.270]  Three times over the legal limit.
[02:38:46.270 --> 02:38:51.871]  Can we get to the newscast part where she's in the jail cell flopping around, kicking, making demon faces?
[02:38:51.871 --> 02:38:53.011]  Yeah, spitting on everybody?
[02:38:54.781 --> 02:38:56.403]  Meanwhile, I mean, I just know the state law.
[02:38:56.403 --> 02:39:01.730]  Rick Perry did what he, he should be, he should be impeached if he didn't do this.
[02:39:01.730 --> 02:39:03.151]  This is actually what a governor is supposed to do.
[02:39:04.141 --> 02:39:06.642]  Well now he's had to basically turn his firearms in.
[02:39:06.642 --> 02:39:12.344]  He has to either say that they're his wife and in a locked safe or he can be SWAT teamed.
[02:39:12.344 --> 02:39:15.125]  And he better get the guns out of his house or they'll do it.
[02:39:15.125 --> 02:39:16.205]  They run this town.
[02:39:16.205 --> 02:39:21.667]  Felony indictment prevents Governor Perry from carrying or buying guns.
[02:39:21.667 --> 02:39:26.789]  Democrat driven charges against Republican Governor are proving to be a form of gun control.
[02:39:26.789 --> 02:39:27.829]  Western Journalism Center.
[02:39:35.703 --> 02:39:36.763]  Should I go to your phone calls?
[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:11.182]  I mean, it's a whole other wrinkle to this lady.
[02:40:11.182 --> 02:40:16.703]  Indicting the wrong person and then saying, I don't care.
[02:40:16.703 --> 02:40:20.925]  That's the arrogance of power.
[02:40:20.925 --> 02:40:23.765]  And you can get a local boss hog that's just as bad as Hitler.
[02:40:23.765 --> 02:40:24.806]  You let it go long enough.
[02:40:24.806 --> 02:40:27.907]  By the way, I mean, I know full well criticizing this woman.
[02:40:27.907 --> 02:40:32.008]  She might indict me for something.
[02:40:32.008 --> 02:40:35.409]  I know she's been reportedly running persecution programs against the Sheriff's Department.
[02:40:36.363 --> 02:40:38.525]  See, you want to blame the cops for the way this country is?
[02:40:38.525 --> 02:40:46.733]  How about we blame people like her and ourselves for letting laws and regulations be put in place that are this out of control?
[02:40:46.733 --> 02:40:48.495]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:40:48.495 --> 02:40:50.677]  Matthew, in South Carolina, you had one last thought.
[02:40:50.677 --> 02:40:53.039]  Benghazi investigation, you're congressman.
[02:40:53.039 --> 02:40:55.701]  Yeah, I'd look for your congressman to get set up and put in jail.
[02:40:55.701 --> 02:40:59.345]  They're arresting a lot of people right now, but they can't throw us all in jail, can they?
[02:41:00.231 --> 02:41:03.092]  I don't know how well that might work out.
[02:41:03.092 --> 02:41:05.193]  I honestly think he's fighting the good fight.
[02:41:23.704 --> 02:41:27.185]  There are not very many people in Washington that are doing that.
[02:41:27.185 --> 02:41:37.909]  I would tell you some Jerry Brown, Governor Moonbeam stories, but I'm not going to get into that now, because I know you've got other callers on hold.
[02:41:37.909 --> 02:41:39.010]  No, go ahead.
[02:41:39.010 --> 02:41:39.670]  You held the wall.
[02:41:39.670 --> 02:41:40.811]  Tell us your Moonbeam story.
[02:41:40.811 --> 02:41:44.132]  I remember he said all sorts of crazy stuff.
[02:41:44.132 --> 02:41:49.954]  Yeah, I mean, Jerry Brown, when he ran for the Democratic
[02:41:50.717 --> 02:41:51.337]  Yeah, you know why?
[02:42:21.391 --> 02:42:26.355]  Vietnamese that want to leave communist Vietnam are about 80% conservative.
[02:42:26.355 --> 02:42:29.017]  So it's the politics, not the skin color.
[02:42:29.017 --> 02:42:34.420]  They want people that will vote Democrat and vote for gun control as long as they get a paycheck.
[02:42:34.420 --> 02:42:40.965]  And again, that's who's coming out of Central America.
[02:42:40.965 --> 02:42:46.890]  And speaking as a student of philosophy, you broke down existentialism, existential envy.
[02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:48.831]  You broke it down very well, I think, for the layman.
[02:42:51.161 --> 02:42:53.382]  Just wanted to say that, and I'll let you get on to your other callers.
[02:42:53.382 --> 02:42:54.003]  Thank you, brother.
[02:42:54.003 --> 02:42:55.023]  Thank you for calling, Matthew.
[02:42:55.023 --> 02:43:06.189]  Yeah, it's people that... that if you win a big award, your girlfriend gets mad at you.
[02:43:06.189 --> 02:43:14.474]  Or if your wife gets a promotion, and you go home and your husband gets drunk and breaks stuff.
[02:43:14.474 --> 02:43:16.355]  I mean, this is the problem.
[02:43:16.355 --> 02:43:18.176]  This is one of the big problems.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.740]  Somebody in my family wins a lottery, I'm happy for them.
[02:43:22.740 --> 02:43:29.522]  Somebody in my family invents something new that makes a million dollars, I'm happy for them.
[02:43:29.522 --> 02:43:34.383]  Losers have envy of people that are more successful than them.
[02:43:34.383 --> 02:43:40.044]  Winners admire successful people that have done it by working hard and being inventive.
[02:43:40.044 --> 02:43:43.104]  Now, nothing makes me more disgusted and it's not envy.
[02:43:43.104 --> 02:43:45.505]  I don't envy Warren Buffett for his hundreds of billions of dollars.
[02:43:45.505 --> 02:43:47.885]  It's hundreds of billions, not just the 40 billion you hear.
[02:43:49.531 --> 02:43:51.632]  Conservatively.
[02:43:51.632 --> 02:44:05.561]  It's that he's tax exempt, he wants my guns, he runs all these scams shutting down American industry with him and George Soros, and he is perching on top of everybody, exempt from it, while pushing existential envy.
[02:44:05.561 --> 02:44:07.362]  It's not that he has jets.
[02:44:07.362 --> 02:44:13.226]  It's not that he owns Dairy Queen or Wells Fargo.
[02:44:13.226 --> 02:44:16.188]  It's that he's a fraud and a scammer and a big fat cancer.
[02:44:18.382 --> 02:44:20.144]  And a gangster.
[02:44:20.144 --> 02:44:23.286]  Because he's always on TV eating an ice cream or being a little old man.
[02:44:23.286 --> 02:44:24.447]  Oh jeepers!
[02:44:24.447 --> 02:44:25.268]  What's going on?
[02:44:25.268 --> 02:44:28.351]  See, real villains go, oh jeepers!
[02:44:28.351 --> 02:44:29.312]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:44:29.312 --> 02:44:30.273]  I'm a little old man.
[02:44:30.273 --> 02:44:33.035]  It's Emperor Palpatine, folks.
[02:44:33.035 --> 02:44:35.617]  Not a little old man.
[02:44:35.617 --> 02:44:37.079]  Michael in Michigan, thanks for holding.
[02:44:37.079 --> 02:44:37.859]  You're a trooper.
[02:44:37.859 --> 02:44:41.242]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:44:41.242 --> 02:44:43.064]  Michelle, excuse me, I can't read the screen.
[02:44:43.064 --> 02:44:45.005]  Michelle in Michigan, I apologize.
[02:44:45.005 --> 02:44:45.266]  Go ahead.
[02:44:46.806 --> 02:44:57.533]  Well, I wanted to ask you, you know, under the Constitution, it says that any law that's passed that goes against the Constitution is null and void.
[02:44:57.533 --> 02:45:00.014]  So, what's your take on this?
[02:45:00.014 --> 02:45:06.998]  Is it just because everybody's gotten out of control in complacency because there's lithium in the water?
[02:45:06.998 --> 02:45:08.539]  What do you think?
[02:45:08.539 --> 02:45:13.783]  It's been a gradual seduction in the last 70 years, people brought up in front of television sets.
[02:45:15.024 --> 02:45:15.485]  I don't
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:39.085]  As long as they have good direction and tell us where to go hunt and what to do, one day we'll be the elders.
[02:45:39.085 --> 02:45:40.466]  It makes sense.
[02:45:40.466 --> 02:45:47.492]  But when you comply with the elders, when they're eugenicists who want to kill you, it's not a very good idea.
[02:45:47.492 --> 02:45:50.535]  And so people are in a literal brain damage trance.
[02:45:50.535 --> 02:45:52.096]  I have articles on it today.
[02:45:52.096 --> 02:45:52.777]  I'll get to it in a moment.
[02:45:53.749 --> 02:46:01.035]  They're in a brain damage trance, and it's so complex, people think something complex is hard and a headache.
[02:46:01.035 --> 02:46:01.676]  No, no, no.
[02:46:01.676 --> 02:46:04.818]  Once you learn complexities, it becomes like a game.
[02:46:04.818 --> 02:46:05.979]  You want to learn the rest of it.
[02:46:05.979 --> 02:46:07.601]  It's like a crossword puzzle.
[02:46:07.601 --> 02:46:09.682]  The harder, the better.
[02:46:09.682 --> 02:46:13.526]  So people have just never been taught how to enjoy learning.
[02:46:13.526 --> 02:46:15.828]  That's why they call it critical thinking in public schools.
[02:46:15.828 --> 02:46:17.689]  It's meant to shut off critical thinking.
[02:46:17.689 --> 02:46:19.691]  It's meant to make it as boring as possible.
[02:46:21.653 --> 02:46:27.334]  So that people just believe television and believe movies, they don't believe what's happening right in front of their face.
[02:46:27.334 --> 02:46:29.455]  The public is under mind control.
[02:46:29.455 --> 02:46:50.019]  That brings up another factor because the federal government has allowed the state's money, our money, through taxpayer dollars to go back in to brainwash these kids and not understand what the Constitution is.
[02:46:50.856 --> 02:46:51.277]  I don't know.
[02:47:03.988 --> 02:47:05.730]  That's right.
[02:47:05.730 --> 02:47:10.974]  1984, the people are so dumbed down, Winston, who's a generation older, can't even talk to them.
[02:47:10.974 --> 02:47:12.296]  They don't even have language.
[02:47:12.296 --> 02:47:13.437]  They have slogans.
[02:47:13.437 --> 02:47:15.238]  Racism, racism, racism!
[02:47:15.238 --> 02:47:18.441]  I mean, sexism, sexism, exact same thing.
[02:47:18.441 --> 02:47:19.562]  You know, I don't want to turn my guns in.
[02:47:19.562 --> 02:47:22.285]  Shut up, white racist!
[02:47:22.285 --> 02:47:29.251]  You know, part of the issue, too, is that now we're at a point in time where most of the people are 65 plus,
[02:47:31.167 --> 02:47:37.370]  As a consequence, what better time to take over a country with a... That's it!
[02:47:37.370 --> 02:47:42.733]  You've got the majority of people who've been paying into something, about to go on the government dole.
[02:47:42.733 --> 02:47:46.235]  It's your money, but it was all set up to control you.
[02:47:46.235 --> 02:47:48.396]  And they've got the illegals coming in to finish the job.
[02:47:48.396 --> 02:47:49.516]  They'll be dependent.
[02:47:49.516 --> 02:47:55.700]  And then it's just game over, unless we point out under the Constitution, you can't make me your slave with your vote.
[02:47:55.700 --> 02:47:57.961]  Two wolves can't vote to make the sheep dinner.
[02:47:58.661 --> 02:47:59.182]  Hey, Alex.
[02:48:28.489 --> 02:48:35.471]  Uh, well, you know, earlier this week you had that interview with Joe Rogan and I was, uh, and I listened to it.
[02:48:35.471 --> 02:48:36.431]  It was pretty good.
[02:48:36.431 --> 02:48:47.474]  Uh, what I, what struck me though is sometimes in, you know, when you're listening or watching an interview, the things that are not discussed is what kind of sometimes it speaks the loudest.
[02:48:47.474 --> 02:48:48.594]  And what I was wondering is,
[02:48:49.164 --> 02:48:58.111]  Joe Rogan has been seen with Stanton LaVey, the grandson of Anton LaVey, who was a priest of the Satanic Church.
[02:48:58.111 --> 02:49:03.796]  And he is making those, you know, the esoteric hand gestures and whatnot.
[02:49:03.796 --> 02:49:10.061]  Why have you not questioned Joe Rogan on his association and what he actually was doing with this guy?
[02:49:10.061 --> 02:49:11.102]  What it means to him?
[02:49:11.102 --> 02:49:12.743]  Why are you doing El Diablo?
[02:49:14.073 --> 02:49:15.334]  First, let me explain something.
[02:49:15.334 --> 02:49:18.976]  When Rick Perry does the El Diablo, it's for the University of Texas.
[02:49:18.976 --> 02:49:20.316]  Let's get that clear.
[02:49:20.316 --> 02:49:24.318]  Joe Rogan was not even really a spiritual person.
[02:49:24.318 --> 02:49:24.859]  Now he basically
[02:49:26.101 --> 02:49:29.344]  He believes in God because of more of his research and things.
[02:49:29.344 --> 02:49:30.925]  Joe is not a Satanist.
[02:49:30.925 --> 02:49:33.067]  He's been to thousands of red carpets.
[02:49:33.067 --> 02:49:34.148]  Somebody sent me that photo.
[02:49:34.148 --> 02:49:35.009]  I asked Joe about that.
[02:49:35.009 --> 02:49:36.450]  I said, hey, you know, what was that?
[02:49:36.450 --> 02:49:37.451]  He goes, oh, just some event.
[02:49:37.451 --> 02:49:38.412]  I was joking around.
[02:49:38.412 --> 02:49:39.633]  To him, that's all a big joke.
[02:49:39.633 --> 02:49:40.714]  He's the host of the UFC.
[02:49:40.714 --> 02:49:42.436]  I think that was a UFC party.
[02:49:42.436 --> 02:49:44.277]  Some bald-headed guy in a vampire outfit.
[02:49:44.277 --> 02:49:45.619]  I mean, it's a joke to Joe.
[02:49:45.619 --> 02:49:51.024]  He's all about life, about wearing Johnny Cash shirts and going, you know, hunting animals now.
[02:49:52.665 --> 02:49:53.046]  Yes, sir.
[02:50:09.489 --> 02:50:12.251]  Joe comes on my show some, my audience tunes into him.
[02:50:12.251 --> 02:50:17.916]  I then get to talk to a very worldly audience interviewing a Russell Brand or a Joe Rogan.
[02:50:17.916 --> 02:50:18.717]  So I want to explain this.
[02:50:18.717 --> 02:50:20.999]  People used to say to Ron Paul, why do you want Alex Jones' show?
[02:50:20.999 --> 02:50:26.965]  And he'd go, well, I agree with about 99% of it, but plus, do I question Fox News or CNN about how you have on?
[02:50:26.965 --> 02:50:28.886]  I mean, Glenn Beck's asked him that.
[02:50:28.886 --> 02:50:30.048]  Well, why do you go on Alex Jones' show?
[02:50:30.048 --> 02:50:32.350]  Well, do I question who goes on your show?
[02:50:35.410 --> 02:50:36.431]  I mean, here's the thing.
[02:50:36.431 --> 02:50:41.596]  People go, hey, he has Joe Rogan on, who once was at a, you know, an event and did the El Diablo.
[02:50:41.596 --> 02:50:44.839]  I mean, Anton LaVey was a carnival-barking con artist.
[02:50:44.839 --> 02:50:48.523]  He even said himself, selling power to weak people.
[02:50:48.523 --> 02:50:51.386]  You think real Satanists dress up like Batboy?
[02:50:51.386 --> 02:50:54.369]  Real Satanists put cancer viruses in your vaccine.
[02:50:54.369 --> 02:50:56.211]  So judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:50:56.211 --> 02:50:57.532]  I'm your exposing evil.
[02:50:57.532 --> 02:50:58.974]  I'm going to come back and talk to you another time.
[02:50:59.810 --> 02:51:04.113]  You've been hearing about the in-home freeze dryer from Harvest Rite for months.
[02:51:04.113 --> 02:51:05.653]  Have you ordered yours yet?
[02:51:05.653 --> 02:51:08.635]  We live in a politically and economically troubled world.
[02:51:08.635 --> 02:51:11.517]  You should be preparing for an uncertain future.
[02:51:11.517 --> 02:51:16.280]  Right now is the time to start freeze drying your own food so you can become self-reliant.
[02:51:16.280 --> 02:51:21.523]  To invest in your own home freeze dryer, go to HarvestRite.com while supplies last.
[02:51:21.523 --> 02:51:25.225]  Again, that's a home freeze dryer from HarvestRite.com.
[02:51:25.225 --> 02:51:26.986]  Mention this ad and save $200 through August.
[02:51:29.542 --> 02:51:34.866]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[02:51:34.866 --> 02:51:36.867]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[02:51:36.867 --> 02:51:40.649]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[02:51:40.649 --> 02:51:44.852]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[02:51:44.852 --> 02:51:51.577]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[02:51:51.577 --> 02:51:55.439]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.
[02:51:55.439 --> 02:51:56.980]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.
[02:51:59.016 --> 02:52:02.177]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[02:52:02.177 --> 02:52:06.359]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[02:52:06.359 --> 02:52:07.919]  What are you doing to prepare?
[02:52:07.919 --> 02:52:11.540]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[02:52:11.540 --> 02:52:13.081]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[02:52:13.081 --> 02:52:14.481]  The total amount of debt in the U.S.
[02:52:14.481 --> 02:52:18.083]  has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[02:52:18.083 --> 02:52:24.945]  The too-big-to-fail banks are much larger, and the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control
[02:52:25.385 --> 02:52:30.511]  That the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming.
[02:52:30.511 --> 02:52:38.900]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street casino and start a cash-flowing international business of your own.
[02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:45.327]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can grow your wealth like having your own business.
[02:52:45.327 --> 02:52:46.288]  The crash is coming.
[02:52:46.548 --> 02:52:49.153]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[02:52:49.153 --> 02:52:51.938]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[02:52:51.938 --> 02:52:53.240]  That's babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[02:52:58.570 --> 02:52:59.831]  Another major health threat.
[02:52:59.831 --> 02:53:04.813]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:53:04.813 --> 02:53:07.495]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:53:07.495 --> 02:53:14.518]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:53:14.518 --> 02:53:17.480]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:20.461]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:53:20.461 --> 02:53:22.482]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:53:22.482 --> 02:53:25.304]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:53:25.384 --> 02:53:31.126]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:53:31.126 --> 02:53:34.627]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:53:34.627 --> 02:53:37.728]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:53:37.728 --> 02:53:45.050]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:53:45.050 --> 02:53:48.271]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[02:53:48.271 --> 02:53:54.553]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today to purchase your ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System.
[02:53:54.673 --> 02:53:55.214]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:55.214 --> 02:54:00.139]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:54:00.139 --> 02:54:01.720]  No matter how hard you...
[02:54:21.977 --> 02:54:22.918]  You know, I see this a lot.
[02:54:22.918 --> 02:54:25.539]  I've seen it in the comments on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:25.539 --> 02:54:28.201]  Why isn't Alex covering the border?
[02:54:28.201 --> 02:54:29.541]  Why isn't it being covered here?
[02:54:29.541 --> 02:54:30.962]  And I'll look on the site.
[02:54:30.962 --> 02:54:33.143]  There'll be like three articles about the border.
[02:54:33.143 --> 02:54:36.025]  We have reporters breaking that they're shipping people across.
[02:54:36.025 --> 02:54:38.086]  The New York Times has to admit it.
[02:54:38.086 --> 02:54:40.868]  But it's like this social thing of one-upping someone.
[02:54:40.868 --> 02:54:42.789]  Oh, Alex didn't cover the border.
[02:54:42.789 --> 02:54:45.611]  Or, I'd sure like to see the Federal Reserve covered here.
[02:54:46.411 --> 02:54:57.437]  Or then I get invited up to some comedy club and do some 30-minute interview in a little green room with, you know, pots and pans bashing around in the kitchen next to me and, why didn't you bring up the Satanism thing?
[02:54:57.437 --> 02:54:59.878]  But, you know, I think that is a good question because I've actually asked Joe.
[02:54:59.878 --> 02:55:00.539]  I said, hey, what was that?
[02:55:00.539 --> 02:55:01.579]  He said, oh, it was some stupid party.
[02:55:01.579 --> 02:55:03.280]  I was making a joke out of it or whatever.
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:09.083]  But next time I interview Joe, I'll say, hey, folks say you're a Satanist because you were at that party once or something.
[02:55:09.083 --> 02:55:12.665]  And, you know, he has like a DMT tattoo, a molecule on his arm.
[02:55:12.805 --> 02:55:13.425]  on his arm.
[02:55:13.425 --> 02:55:14.406]  They say that's a pentagram.
[02:55:14.406 --> 02:55:24.792]  No, that's a molecule of the dream chemical in your brain that's associated with higher consciousness and opening up your third eye, which I don't even get into.
[02:55:24.792 --> 02:55:32.776]  But I'm not here to... I mean, I've literally have had Jesse Ventura on the show probably 50 times.
[02:55:32.776 --> 02:55:35.358]  I don't agree with Jesse Ventura on the border.
[02:55:35.358 --> 02:55:37.179]  Does that mean I'm Jesse Ventura?
[02:55:37.179 --> 02:55:38.479]  Or I've had
[02:55:40.037 --> 02:55:42.239]  Democrats on the show that I totally disagree with.
[02:55:42.239 --> 02:55:46.183]  I've had Charles Rangel on, who's had ethics committee hearings.
[02:55:46.183 --> 02:55:51.187]  It's like asking me, are you involved in the ethics committee hearings with Rangel?
[02:55:52.368 --> 02:55:57.212]  Uh, so, to say if there's an interview, I mean, hell, I interviewed Russell Brand three or four times.
[02:55:57.212 --> 02:55:58.472]  He's a listener.
[02:55:58.472 --> 02:56:02.475]  You know, he and his ex-wife, Katy Perry, listened to the show, he told me.
[02:56:02.475 --> 02:56:04.056]  Uh, he said that on air.
[02:56:04.056 --> 02:56:06.758]  Uh, did I get there and go, how dare you not be a Christian?
[02:56:06.758 --> 02:56:11.522]  How dare you come part of the way towards fighting the New World Order and now even believing in God?
[02:56:11.522 --> 02:56:12.803]  How dare you, Russell Brand?
[02:56:12.803 --> 02:56:14.364]  Let's talk about that, Russell Brand!
[02:56:14.364 --> 02:56:16.005]  Let's talk about the fact that you're a devil!
[02:56:16.829 --> 02:56:18.550]  No, I mean, I'm interviewing.
[02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:21.913]  I mean, I interviewed Gore Vidal, who I agree with on, like, a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:56:21.913 --> 02:56:23.294]  I disagree on a bunch of other stuff.
[02:56:23.294 --> 02:56:25.495]  He exposes false flags.
[02:56:25.495 --> 02:56:29.658]  I'm sitting there talking to an old gay man in a wheelchair in Austin.
[02:56:29.658 --> 02:56:31.580]  He gave us an interview once in person.
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:33.001]  So I go, and you're gay!
[02:56:33.001 --> 02:56:34.522]  Let's talk about that!
[02:56:34.522 --> 02:56:36.083]  Alex had Gore Vidal on!
[02:56:36.083 --> 02:56:38.725]  That means he's gay!
[02:56:38.725 --> 02:56:41.007]  Alex Jones doesn't want to blow Israel up!
[02:56:41.007 --> 02:56:42.168]  He works for Israel!
[02:56:42.168 --> 02:56:42.828]  Talk about it!
[02:56:42.828 --> 02:56:43.889]  Talk about how you work for Israel!
[02:56:44.952 --> 02:56:46.972]  I don't care that I'm being criticized.
[02:56:46.972 --> 02:56:50.393]  I'm sick of people not looking at what I stand for.
[02:56:50.393 --> 02:56:51.634]  Private property.
[02:56:51.634 --> 02:56:52.834]  Anti-abortion.
[02:56:52.834 --> 02:56:54.254]  National sovereignty.
[02:56:54.254 --> 02:56:55.474]  Local control.
[02:56:55.474 --> 02:56:56.735]  Small government.
[02:56:56.735 --> 02:56:58.215]  Believing in humanity.
[02:56:58.215 --> 02:57:00.215]  Not having poisons in our food and water.
[02:57:00.215 --> 02:57:02.376]  Not having all this GMO shoveled on us.
[02:57:02.376 --> 02:57:03.456]  Labeling.
[02:57:03.456 --> 02:57:05.357]  I stand for prosperity.
[02:57:05.357 --> 02:57:06.337]  I stand for freedom.
[02:57:07.097 --> 02:57:09.220]  And they have these mindless projections.
[02:57:09.220 --> 02:57:11.442]  Like, one time I was given a speech, and they'll do it again.
[02:57:11.442 --> 02:57:16.108]  And I went, you know, this symbol means hook them horns if you're a UT fan.
[02:57:16.108 --> 02:57:17.790]  But it could also mean you worship the devil.
[02:57:17.790 --> 02:57:20.714]  But what it really means in Italy is you're warding off devil.
[02:57:20.714 --> 02:57:22.997]  So symbols mean different things to different people.
[02:57:22.997 --> 02:57:26.481]  They will take this, and they will make videos saying I'm hailing Satan.
[02:57:26.741 --> 02:57:27.442]  Do it!
[02:57:27.442 --> 02:57:30.043]  I don't care about your existential envy!
[02:57:30.043 --> 02:57:30.944]  I'm real!
[02:57:30.944 --> 02:57:31.944]  I know I'm good!
[02:57:31.944 --> 02:57:33.485]  I know I love freedom!
[02:57:33.485 --> 02:57:36.828]  And I love it when you attack me, because I can then illustrate it.
[02:57:36.828 --> 02:57:38.189]  There you go, you got one minute to respond.
[02:57:38.189 --> 02:57:42.271]  I'm gonna go to Overdrive and take phone calls.
[02:57:42.271 --> 02:57:43.632]  Go ahead, caller!
[02:57:43.632 --> 02:57:45.533]  Matt, expose me!
[02:57:45.533 --> 02:57:46.994]  Or who was I talking to?
[02:57:46.994 --> 02:57:49.416]  Who was the caller?
[02:57:49.416 --> 02:57:50.116]  He dropped off?
[02:57:50.116 --> 02:57:51.357]  Come on!
[02:57:51.357 --> 02:57:53.819]  You got a chance to expose El Diablo right here!
[02:57:53.819 --> 02:57:55.140]  But if I was promoting abortion...
[02:57:56.243 --> 02:57:59.586]  And if I was throwing world government in war, I'd be a good person, right?
[02:57:59.586 --> 02:58:01.008]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:58:01.008 --> 02:58:02.589]  I'm not comparing myself to Christ.
[02:58:02.589 --> 02:58:07.014]  But Christ hung out with tax collectors and whores and murderers.
[02:58:07.014 --> 02:58:09.096]  Because that's where he knew he could do some good.
[02:58:09.096 --> 02:58:12.639]  Not with all the goody-two-shoe Pharisees up on the hill.
[02:58:12.639 --> 02:58:14.841]  I'm gonna come back and go to you, Matt, in a moment.
[02:58:14.841 --> 02:58:17.344]  Who were just so, oh my gosh!
[02:58:18.855 --> 02:58:23.258]  Jesus was seen down in the city, in the center of the city, with bad people.
[02:58:23.258 --> 02:58:24.499]  Let's kill him!
[02:58:24.499 --> 02:58:26.801]  Yeah, he was seen with a sorceress.
[02:58:26.801 --> 02:58:28.803]  I bet he's involved in devil worship.
[02:58:28.803 --> 02:58:30.584]  Let's kill him, yeah!
[02:58:30.584 --> 02:58:32.565]  Let's crucify him!
[02:58:32.565 --> 02:58:34.707]  Because we're holy!
[02:58:34.707 --> 02:58:36.869]  We're good!
[02:58:36.869 --> 02:58:38.470]  Yeah, right, we all know.
[02:58:38.470 --> 02:58:40.972]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.

[02:59:19.513 --> 02:59:24.154]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[02:59:24.154 --> 02:59:28.936]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:59:28.936 --> 02:59:29.936]  Talk about the effects.
[02:59:30.256 --> 02:59:31.757]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:59:31.757 --> 02:59:33.698]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:59:33.698 --> 02:59:34.799]  I feel like I look better.
[02:59:34.799 --> 02:59:35.459]  I feel better.
[02:59:35.459 --> 02:59:36.920]  I feel sexier.
[02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:37.540]  I love it.
[02:59:37.540 --> 02:59:40.522]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[02:59:52.248 --> 02:59:54.290]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.290 --> 02:59:57.511]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.024 --> 03:00:07.325]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.325 --> 03:00:09.086]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:09.086 --> 03:00:10.848]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.848 --> 03:00:12.449]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.449 --> 03:00:13.990]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:18.173]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.173 --> 03:00:23.337]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.337 --> 03:00:26.039]  Two articles just went live at InfoWars.com.
[03:00:26.039 --> 03:00:27.540]  I want you to retweet them.
[03:00:27.540 --> 03:00:30.522]  One of them is ten conspiracy theories that came true.
[03:00:32.472 --> 03:00:36.057]  The other is FBI ordered police department to conceal stingray use.
[03:00:36.057 --> 03:00:39.201]  That's these systems used to grab up all your cellular data.
[03:00:39.201 --> 03:00:42.605]  Because they were used to find IEDs from Al-Qaeda.
[03:00:42.605 --> 03:00:44.647]  Yeah, everything they do is to stop IEDs.
[03:00:44.647 --> 03:00:45.889]  Total bull.
[03:00:45.889 --> 03:00:47.411]  Those stories are up on Infowars.com.
[03:00:47.411 --> 03:00:48.612]  I didn't mean to go off on a jag.
[03:00:50.137 --> 03:01:12.391]  It's just that, I guarantee you, the people that are always attacking me have taken videos where I've been describing how the Diablo sign used to be an ancient Italian thing for warding off evil, or it can be a symbol for UT football, or it can be the sign, I guess, of a cow in some sign language, or it can be the sign of, you know, you like devil worship or something.
[03:01:13.868 --> 03:01:21.693]  Like the all-seeing eye was an ancient symbol of awakening, now it's been taken by the New World Order, and I guess by Lord of the Rings, so it's a symbol of evil.
[03:01:21.693 --> 03:01:26.196]  It's just, it's just, it's these obsessions with symbols instead of content.
[03:01:26.196 --> 03:01:33.161]  And that's how the globalists masquerade as good guys, because they're wearing, you know, Warren Buffet in a little suit, I'm a little nice old man, you know.
[03:01:33.161 --> 03:01:37.304]  He's actually a super hardcore tyrant who wants your guns.
[03:01:37.304 --> 03:01:41.967]  If you're wearing a devil outfit, the guys that want to look scary, it's a joke.
[03:01:45.512 --> 03:01:49.694]  It's the people that don't look scary you better watch out for, folks.
[03:01:49.694 --> 03:01:51.755]  Matt in North Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:51.755 --> 03:01:53.156]  Welcome.
[03:01:53.156 --> 03:01:54.276]  Hey, what's going on, Bob?
[03:01:54.276 --> 03:01:55.437]  Worldwide broadcast, sir.
[03:01:55.437 --> 03:01:57.258]  Thank you for calling in.
[03:01:57.258 --> 03:01:57.978]  Ain't no problem, man.
[03:01:57.978 --> 03:02:04.281]  Look, Alex, I want to give you a perspective on the illegal immigration that most people aren't getting.
[03:02:04.281 --> 03:02:08.383]  When the economy's down, there's only two ways to increase the economy.
[03:02:08.383 --> 03:02:11.885]  That's increase exports or increase immigration.
[03:02:12.563 --> 03:02:17.126]  When people come over the border, they have to have homes, clothes, etc.
[03:02:17.126 --> 03:02:17.827]  Things to live by.
[03:02:17.827 --> 03:02:18.527]  Actually, you're right.
[03:02:18.527 --> 03:02:22.710]  That's the establishment's argument is the baby boomers didn't have enough kids to replace them.
[03:02:22.710 --> 03:02:23.891]  We got to bring these people in.
[03:02:23.891 --> 03:02:24.531]  I get it.
[03:02:24.531 --> 03:02:25.772]  Bring in skilled people.
[03:02:25.772 --> 03:02:27.373]  I don't care what color they are.
[03:02:27.373 --> 03:02:31.916]  Don't bring in moms with three kids that'll bankrupt the system.
[03:02:31.916 --> 03:02:32.697]  Absolutely.
[03:02:32.697 --> 03:02:37.500]  And if they try to use these people as a voting block, that's just an extra for them.
[03:02:37.500 --> 03:02:38.801]  That's just a bonus for them.
[03:02:38.801 --> 03:02:41.763]  Now, what people have to understand is that
[03:02:42.779 --> 03:02:45.921]  Yes, they do want a North American Union or whatever.
[03:02:45.921 --> 03:02:47.322]  That's just a name.
[03:02:47.322 --> 03:02:51.125]  You know, I mean, this is part of their order out of chaos.
[03:02:51.125 --> 03:02:54.267]  Their chaos is not having control of everything.
[03:02:54.267 --> 03:02:58.610]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:02:58.610 --> 03:03:01.732]  More control for them.
[03:03:01.732 --> 03:03:06.736]  And this all leads back and people have to understand, they have to look at what's going on.
[03:03:06.736 --> 03:03:10.839]  When it looks like the car's heading for the ditch, there's a reason for that.
[03:03:10.839 --> 03:03:12.200]  The car's heading for the ditch.
[03:03:12.981 --> 03:03:15.342]  You follow what I mean?
[03:03:15.342 --> 03:03:16.002]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:16.002 --> 03:03:33.830]  9-11, the North American Union, the tanking of the economy, all of this was all pre-planned and quite masterfully, and in a lot of ways it was done sloppy, but the people bought it, so, you know, if the bar's low, you don't have to jump real high.
[03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:40.533]  So people just really, really need to look at what's going on, and we've got to do something about it.
[03:03:40.533 --> 03:03:41.373]  Now is the time
[03:03:42.316 --> 03:03:48.520]  You know, if everybody goes and takes their money out of the bank, you're not going to cause a depression because you're in the middle of a depression.
[03:03:48.520 --> 03:03:52.122]  You know, now we're either going to go left or we're going to go right.
[03:03:52.122 --> 03:03:53.443]  That's it.
[03:03:53.443 --> 03:03:54.123]  Well, that's right.
[03:03:54.123 --> 03:03:56.324]  And we're converting to a pure fraud economy.
[03:03:56.324 --> 03:03:59.346]  And when that happens, like Mao Zedong, tens of millions die.
[03:03:59.346 --> 03:04:01.087]  I mean, this is this is not a joke.
[03:04:01.087 --> 03:04:02.708]  This is hardcore serious.
[03:04:02.708 --> 03:04:06.550]  It's only going to get worse until we have a full awakening to it and start reversing it.
[03:04:06.550 --> 03:04:07.511]  And the system knows that.
[03:04:07.511 --> 03:04:11.073]  So they're trying to wreck it as fast as they can, then poses favors, you know.
[03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:16.984]  I didn't, uh, Tim in California says he's a marine captain, supports him for wars.
[03:04:16.984 --> 03:04:17.945]  I'm gonna do more Overdrive.
[03:04:17.945 --> 03:04:24.551]  I'm gonna go to Tim, then I'm gonna go to Ethan, Eric, and Robert in the final segment.
[03:04:24.551 --> 03:04:25.732]  We're gonna go into Overdrive here.
[03:04:25.732 --> 03:04:27.554]  Expanded Overdrive on the other side of this break.
[03:04:27.554 --> 03:04:28.735]  A lot of great callers here today.
[03:04:28.735 --> 03:04:36.882]  You know, on the whole Joe Rogan thing, if that caller would have called and said, why does Joe Rogan been photographed with Anton LaVey's grandson doing a devil sign?
[03:04:37.813 --> 03:04:41.914]  I would then say, oh that's a good question, Joe said that was a joke at some party.
[03:04:41.914 --> 03:04:52.977]  I know Joe to be a really nice guy who cares about animals and everything else, but I was interviewing him just about, he's a popular guy, I've known him for a long time, so I don't agree with everything he does.
[03:04:52.977 --> 03:04:55.018]  Instead it was, why are you not bringing this up?
[03:04:55.018 --> 03:04:55.938]  Why are you not covering it?
[03:04:55.938 --> 03:04:58.019]  I'm just sick of it, okay?
[03:04:58.019 --> 03:04:58.699]  I'm just tired of it.

[03:05:59.063 --> 03:06:00.523]  Effective.
[03:06:00.523 --> 03:06:01.283]  I didn't believe it.
[03:06:01.283 --> 03:06:05.744]  Neither did I. No way could you professionally remove unwanted hair pain-free and at home.
[03:06:05.744 --> 03:06:06.965]  My thoughts exactly.
[03:06:06.965 --> 03:06:10.105]  Remove my face and body hair without expensive painful office visits?
[03:06:10.105 --> 03:06:10.905]  Not possible.
[03:06:10.905 --> 03:06:12.166]  Great minds think alike.
[03:06:12.166 --> 03:06:14.206]  Until I tried No-No Pro.
[03:06:14.206 --> 03:06:15.486]  Wait, you tried No-No?
[03:06:15.486 --> 03:06:17.187]  Yes, and it works.
[03:06:17.187 --> 03:06:19.247]  I use it on my face, legs, bikini line.
[03:06:19.247 --> 03:06:21.588]  We're BFFs and you didn't tell me about No-No?
[03:06:21.588 --> 03:06:23.128]  Here, this is my new No-No Pro.
[03:06:23.288 --> 03:06:24.689]  The most powerful no-no maid.
[03:06:24.689 --> 03:06:26.870]  Custom treatment levels, less hair in less time.
[03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:28.291]  Perfect for any skin type.
[03:06:28.291 --> 03:06:28.751]  Try it.
[03:06:28.751 --> 03:06:29.271]  No hair?
[03:06:29.271 --> 03:06:29.872]  No pain?
[03:06:29.872 --> 03:06:31.993]  No time-consuming expensive office visits?
[03:06:31.993 --> 03:06:32.473]  No.
[03:06:32.473 --> 03:06:32.993]  No.
[03:06:32.993 --> 03:06:33.934]  And no-no.
[03:06:33.934 --> 03:06:36.395]  For a limited time, you can try No-No Pro risk-free.
[03:06:36.395 --> 03:06:38.536]  You'll also get the facial kit and a travel case.
[03:06:38.536 --> 03:06:40.377]  Get weeks of long-lasting results.
[03:06:40.377 --> 03:06:40.818]  That's it.
[03:06:40.818 --> 03:06:41.858]  I'm getting a no now.
[03:06:41.858 --> 03:06:43.119]  Great minds do think alike.
[03:06:44.312 --> 03:06:46.794]  Try Nono Pro risk-free by calling 800-952-5760.
[03:06:46.794 --> 03:06:46.854]  800-952-5760.
[03:06:46.854 --> 03:06:47.074]  That's 800-952-5760.
[03:06:47.074 --> 03:06:47.114]  800-952-5760.
[03:06:59.964 --> 03:07:01.225]  Another major health threat.
[03:07:01.225 --> 03:07:06.207]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:07:06.207 --> 03:07:08.888]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:07:08.888 --> 03:07:15.912]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:07:15.912 --> 03:07:18.893]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:07:18.893 --> 03:07:21.935]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:07:21.935 --> 03:07:23.876]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:07:23.876 --> 03:07:26.757]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:07:26.817 --> 03:07:32.539]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[03:07:32.539 --> 03:07:36.021]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[03:07:36.021 --> 03:07:39.122]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[03:07:39.122 --> 03:07:43.384]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.

[03:07:58.628 --> 03:08:06.730]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.730 --> 03:08:09.011]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:11.630 --> 03:08:16.634]  I worked the last few days on an article that just went live on InfoWars.com.
[03:08:16.634 --> 03:08:21.819]  I know Paul wanted to go with an even ten, but I'm going to add a few bonuses at the end of this as soon as I get off air today.
[03:08:21.819 --> 03:08:28.805]  Ten conspiracy theories that came true when questioning the official narrative proved crucial.
[03:08:32.199 --> 03:08:33.200]  And it goes through it.
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:36.042]  Operation Ajax and false flag terror, number one.
[03:08:36.042 --> 03:08:38.264]  Number two, Gulf of Tonkin.
[03:08:38.264 --> 03:08:41.567]  Number three, Operation Gladio, state-sponsored terror.
[03:08:41.567 --> 03:08:42.948]  Number four, Operation Northwoods.
[03:08:42.948 --> 03:08:45.229]  Number five, the Glywoods incident.
[03:08:45.229 --> 03:08:49.613]  Number six, tobacco companies deliberately added additive chemicals to the cigarettes.
[03:08:49.613 --> 03:08:52.475]  Researchers said that 20 years before it was confirmed.
[03:08:52.475 --> 03:08:57.799]  Seven, Operation Fast and Furious to blame the Second Amendment for Mexico's problems.
[03:08:57.799 --> 03:08:58.240]  Number eight,
[03:08:58.820 --> 03:09:01.242]  NSA spying and mass surveillance.
[03:09:01.242 --> 03:09:03.684]  Number 9, CIA drug trafficking.
[03:09:03.684 --> 03:09:08.047]  Number 10, the CIA's heart attack gun.
[03:09:08.047 --> 03:09:14.731]  But I think we should add in there that the big banks were fixing interest rates with LIBOR and the rest of it.
[03:09:14.731 --> 03:09:16.453]  I want you in the comments below.
[03:09:17.398 --> 03:09:29.746]  Because I know there's tons of stuff I didn't think of to add conspiracy theories that came true in the comments at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and then we'll update this article tomorrow saying readers pointed this out.
[03:09:30.848 --> 03:09:32.249]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:09:32.249 --> 03:09:35.850]  Hey, I just want to let you know Alex, I was in the Marine Corps for 15 years.
[03:09:35.850 --> 03:09:38.331]  I was a police officer out here in Los Angeles.
[03:09:59.526 --> 03:10:06.949]  And I worked as a private security contractor for the State Department for many years in the Middle East.
[03:10:06.949 --> 03:10:09.770]  And I witnessed firsthand the tyranny.
[03:10:09.770 --> 03:10:21.235]  I witnessed firsthand the oppression that our so-called leaders start over there.
[03:10:21.235 --> 03:10:24.156]  And I witnessed a lot of things over there.
[03:10:24.156 --> 03:10:26.717]  And I just want to say that you're right on.
[03:10:27.372 --> 03:10:33.936]  Right on course, you're informing the American public, and that's what's most important.
[03:10:33.936 --> 03:10:48.906]  When I was at Bilderberg 2008 and Hillary and Obama were inside, it was plainclothes Marines assigned to the State Department protective detail that were pulling dirty tricks on us, and it just blew me away.
[03:10:50.683 --> 03:10:52.304]  Yes Alex, I'm very familiar with these tactics that are used.
[03:10:52.304 --> 03:10:54.184]  It's mostly tactics that are passed down from
[03:11:20.100 --> 03:11:25.865]  From higher-ups and the subordinate Marines are not really aware of what they're doing.
[03:11:25.865 --> 03:11:32.130]  They're just following orders, unfortunately, and that makes it difficult for all of us.
[03:11:32.130 --> 03:11:36.374]  It's a very touchy situation, and I don't condone it.
[03:11:36.374 --> 03:11:37.555]  I don't like it.
[03:11:37.555 --> 03:11:44.441]  Like I said, I'm a retired Marine, and really, if there's anything I could do to help, I would love to come in.
[03:11:45.325 --> 03:11:48.487]  Maybe be part of your journalistic team or help you out with something?
[03:11:48.487 --> 03:11:52.989]  Well, I tell you, brother, it'd be great to have an Honorable Discharge Marine Captain doing stuff with us.
[03:11:52.989 --> 03:11:55.870]  Just what you should start doing is doing your own YouTubes.
[03:11:55.870 --> 03:11:56.970]  Even if they're low-tech.
[03:11:56.970 --> 03:11:58.171]  And just show us what you got.
[03:11:58.171 --> 03:11:59.332]  Show us what's going on.
[03:11:59.332 --> 03:12:01.112]  Show us what you're interested in.
[03:12:01.112 --> 03:12:02.893]  And then we're looking for auxiliary reporters.
[03:12:02.893 --> 03:12:08.116]  We're looking for a few part-time paid positions on the West Coast, East Coast, North and South.
[03:12:08.116 --> 03:12:10.337]  I mean, we're looking for five or six.
[03:12:10.337 --> 03:12:12.038]  We're trying to... The problem is organizing it.
[03:12:12.038 --> 03:12:12.598]  We have the money.
[03:12:14.036 --> 03:12:22.023]  But we need to organize it and then because we're responsible for what our reporters do to try to get the training in place while we're doing so many other things.
[03:12:22.023 --> 03:12:31.010]  But folks that want to work with us, do videos, do your own reporting, you know, under your own banner and send it to us as an example of it.
[03:12:31.010 --> 03:12:38.377]  And, you know, I mean, people do Akron type work, you know, like Project Veritas did or whatever the case is.
[03:12:39.650 --> 03:12:41.171]  I mean, we had a reporter contest.
[03:12:41.171 --> 03:12:44.653]  That's how we ended up hiring David Knight, Jakari Jackson, and others.
[03:12:44.653 --> 03:12:45.694]  Darren McBrain, you name it.
[03:12:45.694 --> 03:12:48.055]  Darren McBrain sent us videos for another contest.
[03:12:48.055 --> 03:12:49.696]  He didn't win the contest, but he got a job here.
[03:12:49.696 --> 03:12:52.538]  He does a great job on graphics and as a reporter.
[03:12:52.538 --> 03:12:53.599]  So that's how it works, Tim.
[03:12:53.599 --> 03:12:54.079]  God bless you.
[03:12:54.079 --> 03:12:54.920]  I appreciate your call.
[03:12:55.840 --> 03:12:57.422]  Call back again, tell us some of the stories.
[03:12:57.422 --> 03:12:59.683]  I know you can't tell a lot of them, but I know what it is.
[03:12:59.683 --> 03:13:03.386]  Tens of billions in pallets of money to pay locals off.
[03:13:03.386 --> 03:13:06.969]  Contractors engaging in all sorts of crimes.
[03:13:06.969 --> 03:13:10.172]  Government officials, you know, doing all sorts of horrible things.
[03:13:10.172 --> 03:13:12.414]  I mean, it's just all part of the course.
[03:13:12.414 --> 03:13:17.038]  Because to engage in tyranny, you've got to be pretty immoral.
[03:13:17.038 --> 03:13:20.040]  Not the troops themselves, but the higher-ups.
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:21.862]  And so you see a lot of immoral stuff.
[03:13:21.862 --> 03:13:23.343]  It's not the heroes you see on the news.
[03:13:24.201 --> 03:13:27.663]  Eric in Oregon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:13:27.663 --> 03:13:29.945]  Hey Alex, what's up?
[03:13:29.945 --> 03:13:32.727]  Oh, we're just here on air brother, thanks for calling.
[03:13:32.727 --> 03:13:37.190]  Okay, I got a little information for you concerning NCIA.
[03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:50.720]  I just spent seven years in a work camp, a correctional work camp, with the direct oversight of National Corrections Industries Association of America.
[03:13:50.720 --> 03:13:53.722]  It was a CCA facility, right?
[03:13:56.032 --> 03:14:08.721]  That's right, America has a gulag archipelago of 4 million prisoners, many of them deserve to be there, many don't, competing directly with mainline industry for pennies on the dollar, driving down wages.
[03:14:08.721 --> 03:14:09.361]  Exactly.
[03:14:09.361 --> 03:14:12.324]  They're forced labor camps.
[03:14:12.324 --> 03:14:16.026]  Actually, they're called Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[03:14:16.026 --> 03:14:20.690]  It's under the Department of Army and is partially secret, yes.
[03:14:20.690 --> 03:14:22.191]  Yes, yes, yes, of course.
[03:14:22.191 --> 03:14:24.092]  Well, we're seeing the apex of it.
[03:14:24.648 --> 03:14:35.154]  It's coming up, like the FEMA camps, whatever you want to call them, they're all being unified, integrated into these work camps.
[03:14:35.154 --> 03:14:39.877]  And the felonies are being manufactured at a very fast rate.
[03:14:39.877 --> 03:14:41.999]  Everyone's becoming felon.
[03:14:41.999 --> 03:14:49.643]  And the scary part is right now, they're entertaining national recalls for people on parole.
[03:14:49.643 --> 03:14:52.485]  If you have misdemeanor, anything.
[03:14:53.829 --> 03:14:59.512]  National recalls to, uh, camps.
[03:14:59.512 --> 03:15:05.575]  Yeah, for those that don't know, they call them work camps, and they're federally run, and they're using state prisoners now.
[03:15:05.575 --> 03:15:07.435]  A lot of them are at military bases.
[03:15:07.435 --> 03:15:09.436]  And the good old boys go, well, make them criminals work.
[03:15:09.436 --> 03:15:12.518]  They got cable TV and, you know, masseuses.
[03:15:12.518 --> 03:15:13.418]  No, that's not true.
[03:15:13.418 --> 03:15:18.381]  It is slave labor in this country, and now they're going after
[03:15:19.386 --> 03:15:22.287]  White collar workers, you name it, people that have literally done nothing.
[03:15:22.287 --> 03:15:24.067]  It's a very frightening paradigm.
[03:15:24.067 --> 03:15:31.209]  You should do YouTube videos on it, even if it's under a pen name, a gnome to plume, and just expose it in the Chronicles.
[03:15:31.209 --> 03:15:33.009]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[03:15:33.009 --> 03:15:46.753]  By the way, these are some of the things I wanted to put in the article, but we didn't, and the folks are actually saying it on InfoWars.com in the article, 10 Conspiracy Theories That Came True.
[03:15:49.096 --> 03:15:51.417]  And people are actually bringing up some of the ones I wanted to add but didn't.
[03:15:51.417 --> 03:15:55.580]  La Cosa Nostra, they said that didn't exist.
[03:15:55.580 --> 03:15:56.400]  Hoover said that.
[03:15:56.400 --> 03:15:58.641]  Death Panels, they said that didn't exist.
[03:15:58.641 --> 03:16:00.402]  And the American Care Act.
[03:16:00.402 --> 03:16:04.905]  The NSA, that didn't exist, but we actually have that in there.
[03:16:04.905 --> 03:16:08.407]  This is conspiracy theories that got completely proven and admitted.
[03:16:08.407 --> 03:16:08.887]  People are saying 9-11.
[03:16:12.762 --> 03:16:15.843]  Virus targeting of conservatives, they denied that, turned out they did.
[03:16:15.843 --> 03:16:18.024]  Black helicopters turned out to be confirmed.
[03:16:18.024 --> 03:16:22.146]  Oh yeah, let's add all that.
[03:16:22.146 --> 03:16:31.050]  Absolutely, the USS Liberty turned out to be true, we should add that.
[03:16:31.050 --> 03:16:36.273]  You pretty much say JFK's been proven, but it's not been openly admitted.
[03:16:36.273 --> 03:16:40.595]  See, people are putting a lot of stuff in there.
[03:16:40.595 --> 03:16:40.755]  Yeah.
[03:16:41.647 --> 03:16:43.048]  In fact, we should change the sub-headline.
[03:16:43.048 --> 03:16:44.008]  I'm not bashing Paul.
[03:16:44.008 --> 03:16:50.050]  I wrote this article with him, but I didn't do the headline.
[03:16:50.050 --> 03:16:58.814]  When questioning the official narrative proved crucial, 10 conspiracy theories that came true.
[03:16:58.814 --> 03:17:00.975]  10 theories that turned out to be fact.
[03:17:00.975 --> 03:17:03.936]  I don't know, it's all pretty good, actually.
[03:17:03.936 --> 03:17:07.077]  But we're gonna add some of those other points in there.
[03:17:07.077 --> 03:17:09.579]  Okay, let's go to Robert Louisiana.
[03:17:09.579 --> 03:17:10.379]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:17:11.667 --> 03:17:14.650]  Hey Alex, nice to talk to you, first time caller.
[03:17:14.650 --> 03:17:15.391]  Thank you, brother.
[03:17:15.391 --> 03:17:18.615]  Congratulations on your new affiliate in Oklahoma.
[03:17:18.615 --> 03:17:20.837]  Glad to hear that.
[03:17:20.837 --> 03:17:32.610]  I'm calling about, I wanted to, me and another family of mine were thinking about doing a promotional idea for you and a few of the cities in Louisiana by putting up some billboards.
[03:17:32.610 --> 03:17:32.791]  Wow.
[03:17:34.517 --> 03:17:34.757]  Yeah.
[03:17:34.757 --> 03:17:37.339]  Well, Dustin, you don't need a permission for that.
[03:17:37.339 --> 03:17:44.405]  If you want to plug Infowars.com or a local affiliate or have your own business up there and Infowars.com with it.
[03:17:44.405 --> 03:17:46.066]  People always call up, can I put a billboard up?
[03:17:46.066 --> 03:17:47.768]  Yeah, you don't need my permission.
[03:17:47.768 --> 03:17:48.328]  Please do it.
[03:17:48.328 --> 03:17:50.850]  All right, because I followed up.
[03:17:50.850 --> 03:17:54.373]  I went to an ad and they said that maybe I needed to get permission from it.
[03:17:54.373 --> 03:17:56.174]  So you don't need that?
[03:17:56.174 --> 03:17:56.755]  No, sir.
[03:17:56.755 --> 03:18:00.458]  Who told you you needed to get permission?
[03:18:00.458 --> 03:18:02.820]  You want me to name the ad company?
[03:18:04.304 --> 03:18:05.845]  Oh, I understand.
[03:18:05.845 --> 03:18:10.348]  It's a billboard company.
[03:18:10.348 --> 03:18:12.670]  They're all working as litigious lawyers.
[03:18:12.670 --> 03:18:15.212]  If you call our office, we'll give you a release if they need it.
[03:18:15.212 --> 03:18:17.654]  Or you can just send them this YouTube video.
[03:18:17.654 --> 03:18:20.276]  As long as people don't do business in our name,
[03:18:21.069 --> 03:18:24.212]  Because people can put up Infowars.com and then, you know, a porn shop.
[03:18:24.212 --> 03:18:26.794]  They've actually done that before to freak churches out.
[03:18:26.794 --> 03:18:29.636]  Handed out flyers with porn stuff on it and Infowars.
[03:18:29.636 --> 03:18:32.478]  So then people call, why'd you put porn on our building?
[03:18:32.478 --> 03:18:33.539]  You know, there's dirty tricks.
[03:18:33.539 --> 03:18:37.382]  And I'm like, I don't live in, you know, New York City, sorry.
[03:18:37.382 --> 03:18:38.523]  Or I don't live in Alabama.
[03:18:39.491 --> 03:18:47.556]  It's all a setup, but I mean as long as you're just saying tune in to the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com or some other message, you are welcome to do it.
[03:18:47.556 --> 03:18:50.678]  I'm a public figure and I would love to have you do that.
[03:18:50.678 --> 03:18:54.841]  People always ask for permission to put our stuff on AXS Television.
[03:18:54.841 --> 03:18:56.602]  Absolutely!
[03:18:56.602 --> 03:18:57.502]  I mean look at YouTube.
[03:18:57.502 --> 03:18:59.203]  Everybody uses our clips to attack us.
[03:18:59.203 --> 03:19:02.385]  I don't go after them because I believe in free speech.
[03:19:02.385 --> 03:19:04.987]  As long as people don't call for violence or lie about us.
[03:19:06.074 --> 03:19:08.596]  Uh, but even then I don't even know anything about it because it doesn't do anything to us.
[03:19:08.596 --> 03:19:09.317]  The truth's the truth.
[03:19:09.317 --> 03:19:10.318]  I'm not worried about it.
[03:19:10.318 --> 03:19:11.218]  But God bless you, brother.
[03:19:11.218 --> 03:19:11.979]  That's very exciting.
[03:19:11.979 --> 03:19:12.439]  Anything else?
[03:19:12.439 --> 03:19:13.981]  No, sir.
[03:19:13.981 --> 03:19:15.222]  Thank you.
[03:19:15.222 --> 03:19:15.782]  Thank you.
[03:19:15.782 --> 03:19:21.326]  Yeah, that's a great thing, especially if we have an AM or FM affiliate in the area.
[03:19:21.326 --> 03:19:26.170]  Like Oklahoma City, a new affiliate we just got, or Chicago or wherever the case is.
[03:19:26.170 --> 03:19:27.912]  Or Las Vegas or wherever.
[03:19:27.912 --> 03:19:29.233]  I would call the station and say,
[03:19:30.697 --> 03:19:33.519]  Your radio station, I bet you know how to get a good deal.
[03:19:33.519 --> 03:19:36.001]  Billboards are really cheap right now because that market's collapsed.
[03:19:36.001 --> 03:19:38.483]  They're still very effective, it's just the economy's in a depression.
[03:19:38.483 --> 03:19:41.445]  So, you know, I mean, it's just most billboards are empty.
[03:19:41.445 --> 03:19:43.126]  First, haggle them down to a low price.
[03:19:43.126 --> 03:19:46.809]  You can probably get three billboards for the first price they're going to tell you.
[03:19:46.809 --> 03:19:50.832]  Call the station and say, I want to put this message up, plug in your station, Alex Jones' website.
[03:19:50.832 --> 03:19:52.293]  Let's do it through you.
[03:19:52.293 --> 03:19:56.957]  Then there won't even be a question with the ad company and the local station calls up to promote their host.
[03:19:56.957 --> 03:19:58.097]  I think that's the best way to do it.
[03:19:58.097 --> 03:19:58.678]  I'm out of time.
[03:19:58.678 --> 03:19:59.539]  Sorry to all the other callers.
[03:19:59.539 --> 03:20:00.099]  Nightly Newsnight.
