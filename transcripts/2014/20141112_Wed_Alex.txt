[00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:07.172]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.172 --> 00:00:08.933]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.695]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:12.276]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:13.817]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.817 --> 00:00:18.020]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.606]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:33.352]  Well, just a few minutes ago, the Rosetta mission was successful, launching its probe to the surface.
[00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.441]  I have a fast 34,000 mile an hour moving comet, the European Space Agency.
[00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:46.423]  Congratulations to humanity on true trailblazing.
[00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:47.763]  Very, very exciting.
[00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:52.485]  We're going to play some of that celebration coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:00:52.485 --> 00:01:04.049]  Europe makes space history as the Rosetta mission launching, I have trouble pronouncing this, some say Philae, Philae probe lands on comet.
[00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:08.156]  Pretty exciting stuff.
[00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:09.778]  An amazing video.
[00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.281]  Some of the first images or snapshots have gotten back.
[00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:14.042]  We'll have some of those on screen.
[00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:15.904]  You go to DrugsReport.com.
[00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:19.908]  It's the top image on the site.
[00:01:19.908 --> 00:01:28.457]  You can see the touchdown taking place right there with the overall mission.
[00:01:28.457 --> 00:01:30.639]  Extremely, extremely
[00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:39.664]  Exciting to see that happen in amongst all the other crazy news that we've got here in front of us.
[00:01:39.664 --> 00:01:59.453]  The bad news is back here on earth we are being pirated by the globalists that now want to take over the internet and loot that and tax that to quote protect the public utility.
[00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.873]  And now CBS News reports people are going to be in for a shock.
[00:02:06.873 --> 00:02:13.981]  Penalty for uninsured not signing up for Obamacare to more than triple.
[00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.903]  More than triple.
[00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:19.686]  So it's not going to be $5,000 a year.
[00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:24.231]  It's going to be upwards of even more than that for families.
[00:02:27.153 --> 00:02:28.754]  And it's just the beginning.
[00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:30.494]  But they'll make you feel isolated and alone.
[00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:32.275]  They'll tell you it's not happening.
[00:02:32.275 --> 00:02:41.077]  You'll hold up your Humana bill in Texas that's 530-something percent increase, and they'll just say, shut up, it doesn't exist.
[00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.838]  We control reality, dumb American.
[00:02:43.838 --> 00:02:49.140]  You know, if they catch all these Democrats and professors calling us dumb Americans, who are they?
[00:02:52.961 --> 00:03:03.525]  And I guess America really is a joke, and we are dumb, if they sit up there and screw us publicly, and then laugh at us in our face, and we just love it.
[00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:10.388]  But see, most Americans won't see that professor in now two videos, a new video service, we're going to play that in a moment.
[00:03:10.388 --> 00:03:15.930]  Because that's academic stuff, they know you don't watch C-SPAN, they know you don't watch university channels.
[00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.952]  So when it did go viral, they said Fox News and others, you don't air that.
[00:03:19.952 --> 00:03:20.912]  But it's clearly fair use.
[00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:35.808]  So see, they love to brag in their own conferences because they know the average person is watching Disney television or the NFL on ESPN.
[00:03:37.537 --> 00:03:42.279]  But now it's in Forbes after we reported on it, after Drudge carried stories on it.
[00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:50.663]  See, I just love how Infowars.com, DrudgeReport.com, WorlandDaily.com continues to just force these stories out.
[00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:56.125]  The stupidity of the American voter led us to hide Obamacare's true cross from the public.
[00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:02.466]  Now, that's kind of a twisting there.
[00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:03.648]  That's quotes out of context.
[00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:11.575]  What he said was, the public's stupid, so we hid it from them, and we're counting on them being stupid.
[00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:12.455]  That's how we got it done.
[00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:16.159]  That's clearly the inference that's being made there.
[00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.271]  Not, oh you're too stupid so we hid the fact that it's a big rip-off from you.
[00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:28.536]  No, it's a big rip-off and we hid it and counting on that and the stupidity is how we got the ball across the finish line.
[00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:29.076]  That's what he said.
[00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:33.839]  We're going to play the original clip and then the new clip when he's talking to his students.
[00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.201]  College kids, they're not kids.
[00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:43.766]  People used to, you know, carry out trade missions when they were 15 years old.
[00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:47.668]  Kids used to walk halfway across the country, you know, to meet up with their parents.
[00:04:49.465 --> 00:04:50.888]  A lot of famous stories about that.
[00:04:50.888 --> 00:04:54.354]  Nowadays, you're a kid when you're 30.
[00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:56.999]  No, I was a man when I was 14 years old.
[00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:58.241]  I did everything a man did.
[00:04:58.241 --> 00:04:58.883]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.883 --> 00:04:59.263]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:07.471]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:08.511]  It has changed my life.
[00:05:08.511 --> 00:05:10.692]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[00:05:10.692 --> 00:05:12.213]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.
[00:05:12.213 --> 00:05:14.754]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:14.754 --> 00:05:16.214]  You've heard the callers to the show.

[00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:34.828]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:39.089]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.869]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:48.731]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:49.871]  But for how long?

[00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:10.606]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[00:07:10.606 --> 00:07:20.533]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:23.455]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:23.835]  I think so.
[00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:38.872]  We're good.
[00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:02.632]  We've got it.
[00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:06.194]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.856]  Rosetta Probe touches down on Speeding Comet.
[00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:12.818]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:12.818 --> 00:08:23.605]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:08:23.605 --> 00:08:26.167]  The Rosetta Probe has touched down on Speeding Comet.
[00:08:30.618 --> 00:08:36.099]  Deploying its probe to the surface.
[00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:44.280]  And here for TV viewers is footage of the celebration at the European Space Agency Launch Command Center.
[00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:13.494]  I know it's not a touchdown in a football game, but it's events like this that are the future of humanity and we're going to survive and make it.
[00:09:13.494 --> 00:09:15.215]  Very exciting.
[00:09:15.215 --> 00:09:23.419]  And yes, these tenuous steps look shaky at this point, but then they will start to get bigger and bigger and accelerate exponentially.
[00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:27.101]  There's also a serious danger, though.
[00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:28.762]  The New York Times has come out
[00:09:30.865 --> 00:09:42.208]  And admitted that top scientists and futurists are really worried about a robot arms race with autonomous self-aware robots.
[00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:52.972]  You need to understand that the British drone and the US drones that they're deploying, one of the British drones is called Tyranny,
[00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:57.323]  But they spin it and say that that's a Gaelic word.
[00:09:57.323 --> 00:09:59.704]  But no, it's meant to be Tyrannus.
[00:09:59.704 --> 00:10:00.565]  And there it is.
[00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:03.506]  Fearing bombs that can pick whom to kill.
[00:10:03.506 --> 00:10:09.108]  I'm here to announce to you, they had autonomous drones in orbit at least 10 years ago.
[00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:15.450]  They had radio-controlled and satellite-controlled space planes up in the late 70s.
[00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.092]  And I was told that by the former head of Star Wars, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:10:21.243 --> 00:10:24.826]  It was on record the head of Star Wars when it was classified.
[00:10:24.826 --> 00:10:28.229]  It didn't get founded by Reagan, SDI in the 80s.
[00:10:28.229 --> 00:10:31.532]  It was already there in the Pentagon, obviously.
[00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:33.574]  That's been declassified.
[00:10:33.574 --> 00:10:47.266]  But they had aircraft in orbit with DU-SABOs, which don't have a nuclear explosion, but they have the same kinetic energy as a low-yield nuclear weapon to even be able to kill people six miles under a mountain.
[00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:55.083]  You cannot have people six miles under sea level because it's 150, 200 degrees.
[00:10:55.083 --> 00:11:00.204]  Under a mountain, under a six mile mountain, it's about 65 degrees.
[00:11:00.204 --> 00:11:05.345]  And these are weapons that will destroy whole mountains and super deep underground bases.
[00:11:05.345 --> 00:11:08.646]  Now they had those by 79 operational.
[00:11:08.646 --> 00:11:16.148]  The only reason he could tell me that was because they had accidentally, in some declassifications, released some of that.
[00:11:17.748 --> 00:11:24.331]  Now, they're also reporting in the Washington Post, the Pentagon wants an airborne aircraft carrier to launch drones.
[00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:43.918]  I told you, everything in Captain America is a revelation of the method, where they have these big floating aircraft carriers that launch drones that use face scanning and heat resonance off the top of your head and shoulders to 100% ID you and then kill you with microwave particle beams.
[00:11:46.294 --> 00:11:48.305]  In the movie, it's stylized with laser cannons.
[00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:49.109]  That's not how it works.
[00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:54.663]  They just fry you while you're asleep in your home, and they're not going to have floating aircraft carriers.
[00:11:54.663 --> 00:12:06.650]  Alexander Haig owned the company, launched it in 1991, and had secret operational blimps above the planet at over 130,000 feet by the year 2001.
[00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.652]  They were declassified, of course, about five years ago.
[00:12:09.652 --> 00:12:12.033]  Not what is on board the craft.
[00:12:12.033 --> 00:12:14.534]  Again, everything I'm giving you is super top secret.
[00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:17.436]  And I have it from the sources, and you've noticed it's all been confirmed.
[00:12:18.407 --> 00:12:28.676]  There are hundreds of small blimps in edge of space orbit and reportedly quite a few of the big ones.
[00:12:28.676 --> 00:12:31.878]  But again, we did a review of Captain America.
[00:12:31.878 --> 00:12:33.900]  I told you they were actually developing these.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.301]  Now it's been announced.
[00:12:35.301 --> 00:12:36.782]  So there you have it.
[00:12:36.782 --> 00:12:42.467]  But it will not look like the classic aircraft carrier in the ocean flying around like Captain America.
[00:12:42.467 --> 00:12:44.509]  They're just giant blimp bases.
[00:12:46.174 --> 00:12:51.819]  And huge equivalent of C-130s to launch smaller drone clusters.
[00:12:51.819 --> 00:13:01.287]  But the blimps are in the edge of space, basic orbit, where there's really not any wind, and their whole tops are solar-powered.
[00:13:01.287 --> 00:13:10.195]  And then they have other craft that will go up, other delivery blimps, that will then deliver resupply missions to these command bases.
[00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.972]  Now a lot of this isn't even classified.
[00:13:13.972 --> 00:13:18.738]  Alexander Haig had a TV show that for some reason was on Austin Cable.
[00:13:18.738 --> 00:13:20.621]  It was on nationwide, most areas.
[00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:28.591]  And I would get home after working out at like 6 at night after high school and I would religiously watch it because it was incredible.
[00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:30.853]  It was Haig up there going, well I have these low earth orbit
[00:13:31.534 --> 00:13:33.615]  Systems and all the communications will be on him.
[00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:37.777]  He'll also be able to surveil whoever and kill whoever's a threat to the Republic.
[00:13:37.777 --> 00:13:42.699]  And he's the guy that whenever Reagan was shot, he ran out and said, I am in command!
[00:13:42.699 --> 00:13:43.979]  I am in control here!
[00:13:43.979 --> 00:13:46.980]  I mean, these people are wild.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.581]  And he, of course, is dead now.
[00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:49.942]  You can look up his TV show.
[00:13:49.942 --> 00:13:53.543]  We ought to find, I bet there's archives of that you can get.
[00:13:53.543 --> 00:13:55.884]  We ought to find the episode on his blimp company.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.784]  Because he's the guy that launched the whole blimp deal.
[00:13:59.784 --> 00:14:02.828]  Okay, let's just get off that because I've got a lot of important news to get to.
[00:14:02.828 --> 00:14:12.261]  I started talking about the spacecraft landing and the Rosetta main ship launching the Philae.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.841]  Rosetta probe touches down on speeding comet.
[00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:25.785]  The Rosetta mission has successfully landed a probe on a comet moving more than 35,000 miles an hour in a historic first for space exploration.
[00:14:25.785 --> 00:14:37.389]  Scientists cheered and punched the air in the European Space Agency control room when they received confirmation that the lander was sending signals from the comet.
[00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:40.631]  ESA Director General John Jacques
[00:14:42.376 --> 00:14:48.179]  Dordain, I think, told a delighted audience this is a big step for human civilization.
[00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:49.060]  That's right.
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.600]  That's what we want.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.043]  There's a real fight in government right now about whether we should explore or do anything.
[00:14:55.043 --> 00:14:59.945]  You notice this is an unmanned probe, but you have to at this level.
[00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:06.169]  I'm all for computers, robots, probes helping us, assisting us, but we have to build it all for us.
[00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:10.200]  And where it's controlled by the people and transparent.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.520]  You don't, you will be taken over.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.722]  Every futurist, every top engineer, the inventor of the internet, all of them are on record.
[00:15:17.722 --> 00:15:25.724]  Just Google, Scientist Warren of Rise of the Machines, and they all say, we've had robotics professors, all of them on, they will take over.
[00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:30.525]  Because look, it's being designed by humans from the beginning to oppress.
[00:15:30.525 --> 00:15:34.506]  So the very circuitry, the very missions, the very
[00:15:36.067 --> 00:15:41.869]  The system is going for AI so that humans don't even make the decision to have the kills.
[00:15:41.869 --> 00:15:43.630]  Why is that?
[00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:53.574]  Because the globalists want to be able to have a drone army attack the Republic or anybody else they want or go kill you and your family and then go and self-destruct and blame somebody else basically.
[00:15:56.553 --> 00:16:02.317]  And the robots that they show us at MIT are tinker toys compared to what the Marines and others really have.
[00:16:02.317 --> 00:16:09.602]  You're seeing 20, 30-year-old stuff that they let some graduate students, oh, here's some plans, see if you can build this.
[00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:25.072]  And it's all part of a front, just like the space shuttle, a 1934 design by Werner Von Braun, was just a public resupply truck, tinker toy, to show everybody while the real space program goes on.
[00:16:26.493 --> 00:16:32.076]  And I may admit about 80% of the space program is classified.
[00:16:32.076 --> 00:16:34.917]  You see that space plane they've now been showing the public?
[00:16:34.917 --> 00:16:36.918]  Looks like a small space shuttle.
[00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:38.599]  Yeah, that thing's at least 40 years old.
[00:16:40.236 --> 00:16:46.559]  That's what some of the first space planes looked like decades and decades and decades before were even shown them.
[00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:47.219]  And they admit this.
[00:16:47.219 --> 00:16:51.321]  Like the B-2 bomber, they admit, was in service for 20 years before you were told about it.
[00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:53.862]  That's very old technology.
[00:16:53.862 --> 00:16:58.984]  My dad, when he was a kid, would, you know, see that stuff flying over all the time.
[00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:04.587]  When I was a kid, we were driving home from Grandma's at the ranch back to Dallas and saw three.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.661]  of the stealth fighters.
[00:17:06.661 --> 00:17:09.082]  And it is the stealth fighter you see.
[00:17:09.082 --> 00:17:12.883]  But they were gray-green, flying at about 200 feet over cow pastures.
[00:17:12.883 --> 00:17:13.904]  And they weren't even going fast.
[00:17:13.904 --> 00:17:15.765]  I was like, wow, look at that!
[00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:20.287]  And it was just like, I like Star Wars, and that had just been out a few years.
[00:17:20.287 --> 00:17:21.868]  And I thought, man, spaceships!
[00:17:21.868 --> 00:17:25.609]  And my dad goes, no, secret aircraft.
[00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:31.672]  So, my dad saw a stealth bomber fly over the ranch when he was like 10 years old.
[00:17:31.672 --> 00:17:32.052]  That'd be 1960.
[00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:42.032]  And of course they declassified a few years ago that indeed they did have the batwing or the boomerang shaped type craft in the sixties.
[00:17:42.032 --> 00:17:43.072]  So there you go.
[00:17:43.072 --> 00:17:44.292]  But I don't want to digress anymore.
[00:17:44.292 --> 00:17:47.213]  We've got really serious important news to cover.
[00:17:47.213 --> 00:17:52.454]  But I tend to get off of the scientific stuff when we see amazing things like what just happened with the Rosetta mission.
[00:17:52.454 --> 00:17:53.154]  A big success.
[00:17:53.154 --> 00:17:55.094]  Look for images, video.
[00:17:55.094 --> 00:17:56.334]  More to be coming back from that.
[00:17:56.334 --> 00:17:59.795]  Learning about the nature of the universe, new elements.
[00:17:59.795 --> 00:18:03.256]  Who knows what will be discovered as it begins to drill in and mine
[00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:13.567]  Data out of that Kuiper belt remnant has been hurtled towards the sun.
[00:18:13.567 --> 00:18:20.555]  Now that said, when we come back from break, this is in the London Guardian now.
[00:18:20.555 --> 00:18:24.640]  We reported on this latest round a few years ago.
[00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:28.874]  Not bragging, just letting you know, again, we're proving right.
[00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:31.536]  John Rappaport reported on it a few days ago.
[00:18:31.536 --> 00:18:34.158]  The latest, India mass sterilization.
[00:18:34.158 --> 00:18:36.319]  Women were forced into camps.
[00:18:36.319 --> 00:18:38.821]  That's the London Guardian.
[00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:41.423]  And this has been going on by the millions for decades.
[00:18:41.423 --> 00:18:46.807]  It's even been passed by the Parliament over there to do this.
[00:18:46.807 --> 00:18:53.191]  And they just act like in the West, oh, we don't know what's going on with the Chinese mobile execution vans.
[00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:55.473]  Oh, we don't know what's going on with the tetanus shots.
[00:18:56.516 --> 00:19:05.139]  This is why you don't take... This is the reason you don't take vaccines.
[00:19:05.139 --> 00:19:07.440]  It's because it's social engineering.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:13.442]  They're putting things that reduce your fertility in them here on record, because it'll be too obvious if everybody's sterilized.
[00:19:13.442 --> 00:19:18.844]  They're putting stuff in Latin America, Africa, and Asia that sometimes kills the women, but sterilizes them.
[00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:21.023]  And see, that's the thing.
[00:19:21.023 --> 00:19:24.944]  If it's powerful enough to destroy your fertility, it's killing a lot of these women.
[00:19:24.944 --> 00:19:27.865]  And there's video interviews with them.
[00:19:27.865 --> 00:19:30.786]  I mean, I remember 64,000 kids got paralyzed.
[00:19:30.786 --> 00:19:36.647]  I think 3,000 died in one round of Bill and Melinda Gates vaccines two years ago there.
[00:19:36.647 --> 00:19:43.289]  When they pull up with the armored trucks into villages and the troops jump out with the shots and the UN people, the villagers run all over the world.
[00:19:44.492 --> 00:19:49.296]  50 years ago when they still trusted the white medicine man, they'd run up and beg for it.
[00:19:49.296 --> 00:19:51.358]  Because back then they weren't really doing this.
[00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:54.020]  It was a bunch of bleeding heart Christian doctors over there.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.842]  That's who the globalists send to get your confidence first.
[00:19:56.842 --> 00:19:59.024]  Then they send in the assassins behind them.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.842]  Don't take a cold or flu lying down.
[00:20:03.842 --> 00:20:06.884]  Stand up and fight back with Supernatural Silver.

[00:24:07.734 --> 00:24:09.856]  Big Brother.
[00:24:09.856 --> 00:24:11.918]  Mainstream media.
[00:24:11.918 --> 00:24:15.221]  Government cover-ups.
[00:24:15.221 --> 00:24:16.862]  You want answers?
[00:24:16.862 --> 00:24:19.044]  Well, so does he.
[00:24:19.044 --> 00:24:25.350]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24:29.515 --> 00:24:31.836]  See what government does is they play dumb.
[00:24:31.836 --> 00:24:43.642]  When finally you've got tens of thousands of women a week getting sterilized, hundreds dying because the chemical and bioweapons are so powerful it kills them as well.
[00:24:43.642 --> 00:24:46.904]  In Africa, in India, in Asia.
[00:24:46.904 --> 00:24:55.228]  Then the media will go, well there is a government program, India used to do that, but they're not supposed to anymore go around with these health department vans and grab the women.
[00:24:55.228 --> 00:24:56.929]  And then so many people will say, well Alex,
[00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.290]  There are too many Indians.
[00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:04.871]  I mean, come on, you say don't open the borders up, it'll drive down the wages, but we gotta get rid of these people.
[00:25:04.871 --> 00:25:07.151]  And it's always the liberal trendy.
[00:25:07.151 --> 00:25:09.852]  Don't you understand liberal trendy?
[00:25:09.852 --> 00:25:13.212]  They're doing it to you too, stupid.
[00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:16.353]  They don't care if you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Indian.
[00:25:16.353 --> 00:25:20.014]  They will give you 50-something shots by 18 months.
[00:25:20.014 --> 00:25:23.014]  And boys don't have as tough a blood-brain barrier.
[00:25:23.014 --> 00:25:28.315]  And that's why every town's got warehouses of people in diapers when they're 30 years old.
[00:25:30.814 --> 00:25:34.037]  Now that's a premeditated plan.
[00:25:34.037 --> 00:25:35.238]  To dumb people down.
[00:25:35.238 --> 00:25:36.439]  To make us more manageable.
[00:25:36.439 --> 00:25:39.942]  And in a certain percentage, it overdoes it.
[00:25:39.942 --> 00:25:42.765]  And so you get seriously brain damaged people.
[00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:43.585]  So we can be managed.
[00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:45.967]  We can be stupid.
[00:25:45.967 --> 00:25:47.208]  Like they brag.
[00:25:47.208 --> 00:25:50.071]  And the fluoride and the GMOs that kill the rats that eat it.
[00:25:50.071 --> 00:25:51.792]  And the honeybees that eat it.
[00:25:51.792 --> 00:25:53.014]  I'm gonna say that again.
[00:25:53.014 --> 00:25:55.536]  The BT corn kills rats.
[00:25:55.536 --> 00:25:56.577]  It kills honeybees.
[00:25:57.904 --> 00:25:59.185]  Organ failure in the rats.
[00:25:59.185 --> 00:26:11.574]  By the third generation, every rat species, every rodent species, from guinea pigs to lab mice, are 98% sterile with testicles growing out of their heads or arms.
[00:26:11.574 --> 00:26:12.355]  Stuff like that.
[00:26:12.355 --> 00:26:13.615]  Hair growing out of their mouths.
[00:26:13.615 --> 00:26:15.517]  Want me to show TV viewers the photos?
[00:26:15.517 --> 00:26:19.700]  Just type in GMO rodent tumors.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.901]  It's all being done.
[00:26:21.901 --> 00:26:22.302]  You understand?
[00:26:23.288 --> 00:26:30.275]  We're only one generation into GMO right now, and the killing fields are massive.
[00:26:30.275 --> 00:26:36.161]  And I'm sorry the transmission is a little too hardcore for you, but that's reality.
[00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:42.507]  So we're going to play Leanne McAdoo's report, and then we're going to get in to the guy that calls us Mr. Stupid.
[00:26:45.435 --> 00:26:54.682]  Yeah, type in rodents, GMO, or guinea pigs, hair and mouth, testicles, and it'll have it growing out of their heads and stuff, or out of their mouths.
[00:26:54.682 --> 00:26:56.424]  And it's all funny to the globalists.
[00:26:56.424 --> 00:26:59.286]  Now One Generation's about to start having the next show.
[00:26:59.286 --> 00:26:59.927]  We'll go from
[00:27:01.816 --> 00:27:07.839]  You know, 10% of the kids being autistic or having disorders, until you're 30, 40, and then it'll just be everybody sterile or dying.
[00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:14.482]  But by then all the robots will be patrolling, and already Africa would have been wiped out, Asia would have been pretty much wiped out.
[00:27:14.482 --> 00:27:16.483]  You'll just see how it all happens.
[00:27:16.483 --> 00:27:17.883]  Because the globalists wrote books.
[00:27:17.883 --> 00:27:18.704]  See, I read them.
[00:27:19.344 --> 00:27:20.325]  I read the books.
[00:27:20.325 --> 00:27:21.746]  I read what Ray Kurzweil said.
[00:27:21.746 --> 00:27:26.369]  I read what John P. Holdren and Ehrlich, Paul Ehrlich wrote.
[00:27:26.369 --> 00:27:31.673]  See, I read the Club of Rome 1960s documents and showed them to you and read the quotes on here.
[00:27:31.673 --> 00:27:44.083]  See, they said they had a plan, but we were too stupid to... Listen, just like we have the Obamacare architect, Gruber,
[00:27:46.872 --> 00:27:51.117]  Going on MSNBC yesterday and saying, I didn't mean it, it was off the cuff.
[00:27:51.117 --> 00:27:56.062]  I'm afraid we have him to his students telling him the same thing.
[00:27:56.062 --> 00:28:04.432]  No sir, the whole plan has been deceptive and it's meant to increase prices and it's meant to bankrupt people and it's meant to have death panels and we've got Bill Gates.
[00:28:04.432 --> 00:28:05.713]  I want to do a special report.
[00:28:05.713 --> 00:28:08.076]  Let's get Bill Gates on death panels ready for the next segment too.
[00:28:09.508 --> 00:28:22.014]  And let's get one of the other big architects, Ezekiel Emanuel, on, who's an open eugenicist and an open exterminist and says reduce population, kill the old people, you know, kill babies if you want to after they're born.
[00:28:22.014 --> 00:28:23.235]  I mean, this is all being sold.
[00:28:23.235 --> 00:28:30.258]  I can go to UT right now and about 45% of the people we talk to, we've done it twice, and each time it's 45% roughly.
[00:28:30.258 --> 00:28:33.300]  Almost half say yes, let people kill kids up until age 5.
[00:28:35.523 --> 00:28:38.085]  And we say, seriously, yeah, if it's my choice, I want to be able to kill my kid.
[00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:40.066]  It's all about me, me, me!
[00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:50.952]  And to a powerless, chicken-necked coward who can't even tie their shoelaces and plays video games all day and goes and sits and hears some professor teach him about an obsolete future they're not even going to have.
[00:28:50.952 --> 00:28:55.515]  When you've got stuff like that going on, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:28:56.831 --> 00:29:00.493]  The weaker people are, the more demonic they are, I found.
[00:29:00.493 --> 00:29:05.356]  The more they like the sound of something wicked, they worship at the feet of it.
[00:29:05.356 --> 00:29:08.137]  And don't worry, you're going to get everything you want.
[00:29:08.137 --> 00:29:12.859]  All you servants of evil will be slowly torn apart by your own system.
[00:29:12.859 --> 00:29:15.621]  Everything you wish on others will be poured out on you.
[00:29:15.621 --> 00:29:19.543]  Make me want to throw up your disgusting filth.
[00:29:20.831 --> 00:29:22.612]  People are like, oh my gosh, he's so angry.
[00:29:22.612 --> 00:29:26.133]  Yeah, they're sterilizing women secretly all over the world and been caught.
[00:29:26.133 --> 00:29:26.973]  Yeah.
[00:29:26.973 --> 00:29:30.854]  Yeah, they're brain damaging kids all over the world on purpose and laughing about it.
[00:29:30.854 --> 00:29:33.575]  And then getting up and saying, yeah, Americans are so stupid.
[00:29:33.575 --> 00:29:36.336]  That's why we had to hide the money, the increased prices.
[00:29:36.336 --> 00:29:39.837]  But, you know, adding that to their stupidity, we got it through and they're all laughing.
[00:29:39.837 --> 00:29:41.577]  The other professors are nodding.
[00:29:41.577 --> 00:29:42.657]  Yes.
[00:29:42.657 --> 00:29:43.278]  Yes.
[00:29:43.278 --> 00:29:44.398]  We lie.
[00:29:44.398 --> 00:29:45.438]  We deceive.
[00:29:45.438 --> 00:29:46.759]  Yes.
[00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:47.819]  Yes.
[00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:51.502]  But now the African bishops are going public.
[00:29:51.502 --> 00:29:54.005]  The Catholic bishops and the scientists.
[00:29:54.005 --> 00:29:55.086]  They've caught them.
[00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:55.587]  Stay with us.
[00:30:01.349 --> 00:30:03.991]  InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:30:13.857 --> 00:30:20.981]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.

[00:31:09.771 --> 00:31:16.055]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:31:16.055 --> 00:31:19.658]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:31:19.778 --> 00:31:23.980]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:29.302]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:31:29.302 --> 00:31:30.322]  Not our iodine.
[00:31:30.322 --> 00:31:36.665]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:32:30.962 --> 00:32:34.625]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:34.625 --> 00:32:38.908]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:38.908 --> 00:32:40.689]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:40.689 --> 00:32:46.013]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[00:32:48.554 --> 00:32:49.695]  But for how long?
[00:32:49.695 --> 00:32:51.897]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:32:51.897 --> 00:32:56.320]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.142]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:33:04.571 --> 00:33:06.434]  We are on the march.
[00:33:06.434 --> 00:33:09.618]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:09.618 --> 00:33:13.322]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:23.709 --> 00:33:34.153]  United Nations organizations are charged with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an anti-tetanus vaccine program sponsored by the Kenyan government.
[00:33:34.153 --> 00:33:48.719]  The population control scheme was exposed after the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association sent six samples of the tetanus vaccine that was used during the World Health Organization's immunization campaign this year to laboratories in South Africa for testing.
[00:33:49.159 --> 00:33:54.883]  According to the doctors, all samples tested positive for the HCG antigen.
[00:33:54.883 --> 00:33:59.166]  HCG mimics a natural hormone that's produced by pregnant women.
[00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:06.210]  Well, the bishops and doctors warn that injecting women with HCG actually causes them to develop antibodies against it.
[00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:14.036]  When they do get pregnant and produce their own version of HCG, it triggers the production of antibodies that cause miscarriages.
[00:34:14.656 --> 00:34:31.978]  The doctors said this proved right our worst fears that this World Health Organization campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine.
[00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:39.445]  Now that sounds a lot like a conspiracy theory until you read the World Health Organization's own literature.
[00:34:39.445 --> 00:34:45.710]  This is a report from August 1992 titled, Fertility Regulating Vaccines.
[00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:52.735]  In it, they discuss the most advanced research on FRVs involves vaccines directed against HCG.
[00:34:53.636 --> 00:35:08.485]  As the Kenyan doctors point out, World Health Organization conducted massive vaccination campaigns using the tetanus vaccine that was laced with HCG in Mexico in 1993 and Nicaragua in the Philippines in 94.
[00:35:08.485 --> 00:35:20.352]  Just like with this current inoculation program in Kenya, these campaigns targeted women of childbearing age, 14 to 49 years old, and each received a total of five injections.
[00:35:20.652 --> 00:35:24.614]  A typical tetanus vaccine schedule is just three shots.
[00:35:24.614 --> 00:35:28.777]  And don't be fooled, this isn't about giving women around the world a choice.
[00:35:28.777 --> 00:35:38.683]  The tetanus lace with HCG was given as a fertility regulating vaccine without disclosing its contraceptive effect to the young girls and mothers.
[00:35:38.683 --> 00:35:43.386]  Why would the UN want to suppress the population in developing countries?
[00:35:43.386 --> 00:35:49.910]  The overlords of scientific dictatorship are ruthlessly prosecuting a war on our most defenseless.
[00:35:51.917 --> 00:35:54.598]  In December of 1974, the U.S.
[00:35:54.598 --> 00:36:00.140]  government made third world population reduction a central national security issue.
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:13.144]  The operation plan, titled National Security Study Memorandum 200, openly stated that populous third world nations posed a threat to the international elite's monopoly of global power.
[00:36:13.144 --> 00:36:14.625]  The Kissinger-authored U.S.
[00:36:14.625 --> 00:36:20.147]  plan targeted 13 key countries where massive population reduction was called for.
[00:36:21.224 --> 00:36:31.515]  Kissinger recommended that IMF and World Bank loans be given on condition that nations initiate aggressive population control programs, such as sterilization.
[00:36:31.515 --> 00:36:39.783]  Kissinger also recommended that food be used as a weapon, and that instigating wars was also a helpful tool in reducing population.
[00:36:41.861 --> 00:36:52.510]  In 1972, the Nixon White House also implemented a eugenics policy which was directed by George Herbert Walker Bush, then United States Ambassador to the United Nations.
[00:36:52.510 --> 00:37:03.119]  Bush advised China on the formulation of their one-child policy and directed the federal government to forcibly sterilize more than 40% of Native American women on reservations.
[00:37:04.662 --> 00:37:13.993]  And following in his eugenicist father's footsteps, Bill Gates donates millions of dollars to research population control programs.
[00:37:13.993 --> 00:37:16.956]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:37:18.118 --> 00:37:20.701]  That's back from high school algebra.
[00:37:20.701 --> 00:37:22.823]  But let's take a look.
[00:37:22.823 --> 00:37:25.045]  First we've got population.
[00:37:25.045 --> 00:37:27.768]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:37:27.768 --> 00:37:29.990]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:38.359]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:37:39.875 --> 00:37:51.018]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is committing $10 billion over the next 10 years to make it the most aggressive decade ever, rolling out new vaccines to poor nations around the world.
[00:37:51.018 --> 00:37:55.880]  This idea of population control has been around for decades and probably much longer.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:05.883]  It's backed by powerful economic interests to cull the world population of the useless feeders so corporate giants can exploit world resources unimpeded.
[00:38:08.868 --> 00:38:18.617]  Well, fabulous job by Leanne McAdoo and all the great graphics in there by Darren McBreen and everybody else just in this operation working as a team.
[00:38:18.617 --> 00:38:22.280]  Infowars.com is a true treasure.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.964]  I'm very proud of the team we've got and this good ship.
[00:38:26.964 --> 00:38:29.126]  And it's the good ship that you out there built.
[00:38:30.845 --> 00:38:46.100]  When you've supported us by word of mouth, when you've supported the products that we promote and sell, which of course you found out are high quality and very affordable, competitive, and it's just a great responsibility and I pray every day that
[00:38:48.399 --> 00:38:58.668]  God lead guide and direct my hand and my mind and to help me be a good person and to help me make the right decisions and really tell you the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
[00:38:58.668 --> 00:39:14.321]  But I think I have been put in this position for the reason that I am wild and I do have a twist of cane in me like everyone does.
[00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:16.463]  And so the fact is is that I'm not
[00:39:18.937 --> 00:39:25.259]  Some shrinking violet, unworldly person.
[00:39:25.259 --> 00:39:38.902]  But at the same time then, I, in my spirit, am guilty for the fact that, comparatively, people would say I'm a very moral person, a very nice person, a very truthful person.
[00:39:38.902 --> 00:39:44.143]  But at the same time, I can feel the spirit of this world in me.
[00:39:48.204 --> 00:39:55.930]  And it is very dangerous.
[00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.571]  And so many people out there aren't even aware of it.
[00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:00.793]  So they just give in to it and become slaves of it.
[00:40:03.226 --> 00:40:07.929]  And just think it's cute to be in control and do all these horrible things to other people.
[00:40:07.929 --> 00:40:26.722]  And you can argue there are areas of India, Calcutta, and other areas, and areas of Africa, and areas of South America, and Central America, that are living hellholes, with homeless kids running around with snot running out of their noses, you know, huffing chemicals all day, because that's all they have, out of the junkyards.
[00:40:26.722 --> 00:40:30.084]  And just euthanizing themselves, by frying their brains.
[00:40:32.295 --> 00:40:35.896]  But it all goes back to nutrition.
[00:40:35.896 --> 00:40:52.220]  And if we just built them up and gave them the technology and the true industrialization, all the metrics show, anywhere in the world, people become educated, informed, upright, smart, and only have two kids, or less.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.240]  And population starts to drop.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:01.682]  Instead, the globalists have put in systems to block industrialization, to control populations, and allowed a huge population bloom,
[00:41:03.251 --> 00:41:11.060]  They then call for world government to come in and set up a draconian system worldwide to then exterminate masses of these people.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:17.708]  And really, all it is is an earth-killing conspiracy.
[00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:22.914]  And a huge third world population has been bred as a sacrifice to the god of this world.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:33.645]  And from all my research, intellectual research, factual research, that's really what we're looking at, is these globalists just want to build a hellish world.
[00:41:33.645 --> 00:41:37.747]  They want autonomous killer robots, land, sea, and air.
[00:41:37.747 --> 00:41:39.748]  They want to merge with machines.
[00:41:39.748 --> 00:41:44.031]  They want to just destroy entire populations.
[00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:47.532]  They enjoy it.
[00:41:47.532 --> 00:41:48.853]  It's what they do.
[00:41:48.853 --> 00:41:51.515]  Ted Bundy, why do you like to kidnap women and torture them and kill them?
[00:41:51.515 --> 00:41:52.155]  Because I like it.
[00:42:00.939 --> 00:42:13.866]  And the public is so simple-minded on average, and I don't think has any idea the grip that we're in right now.
[00:42:13.866 --> 00:42:17.568]  The probing, the scientific manipulation.
[00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:24.072]  Coming up for two hours in studio, or close to two hours, the real Rick Ross, real Ricky Ross is going to be in studio.
[00:42:28.704 --> 00:42:36.353]  And he spent 25 years of a life sentenced behind bars for being one of the biggest cocaine dealers in US history.
[00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:38.756]  If not the biggest, publicly known dealer.
[00:42:41.124 --> 00:42:43.865]  People say, well, how would you have somebody like that into your studio?
[00:42:43.865 --> 00:42:52.449]  Well, he had the nerve to not shut up when it came out it was the CIA and to tell the truth and to get a longer prison sentence.
[00:42:52.449 --> 00:43:01.193]  And he has repented of what he's done and speaks at high schools and colleges everywhere and explains to people why they shouldn't get on drugs and why the drug war is a fraud as well.
[00:43:02.703 --> 00:43:16.472]  And how do we sit there and say, oh, he's bad, but the government that shipped it in, and the prosecutors that saw the evidence, it was the CIA, and threatened him and others to shut up.
[00:43:16.472 --> 00:43:17.673]  They're good, though.
[00:43:17.673 --> 00:43:19.895]  They're good because they shipped the drugs in.
[00:43:19.895 --> 00:43:21.676]  They're good because they covered it up.
[00:43:21.676 --> 00:43:29.681]  They're good, and then they put Rick Ross in jail for 25 years when he wasn't a gun-toting, violent drug dealer.
[00:43:29.681 --> 00:43:30.642]  That's the low-level people.
[00:43:31.994 --> 00:43:38.696]  He was the major distributor under the CIA through one intermediary.
[00:43:38.696 --> 00:43:45.158]  As they flew it into those Air Force bases every day by the plane load.
[00:43:45.158 --> 00:43:47.498]  Rick Ross was just the black front.
[00:43:47.498 --> 00:43:51.259]  Everybody knows a drug dealer's a black man.
[00:43:51.259 --> 00:44:00.382]  No, ladies and gentlemen, going back to prohibition, when alcohol prohibition ended, they always stuck the red light districts and the liquor districts in the black neighborhoods.
[00:44:02.042 --> 00:44:06.805]  Because you didn't want to do that in your neighborhood because the preacher of your wife might see you.
[00:44:06.805 --> 00:44:12.048]  So that's where the crime getting nestled started in the black areas.
[00:44:12.048 --> 00:44:20.693]  And then prohibition ended in the 1930s and they made narcotics illegal and started shipping them into the black communities then.
[00:44:20.693 --> 00:44:27.637]  They didn't start shipping drugs in to South Central in 1982 with the crack cocaine epidemic.
[00:44:27.637 --> 00:44:30.098]  A CIA invention, crack cocaine.
[00:44:30.098 --> 00:44:31.179]  Perfected freebasing.
[00:44:32.398 --> 00:44:36.101]  The McDonald's are freebasing.
[00:44:36.101 --> 00:44:36.742]  They didn't.
[00:44:36.742 --> 00:44:37.362]  No, no, no.
[00:44:37.362 --> 00:44:41.205]  It was going on forever.
[00:44:41.205 --> 00:44:42.527]  It was always going on.
[00:44:42.527 --> 00:44:45.769]  And they didn't just stick it in the poor black neighborhoods.
[00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:47.491]  They stuck it in the poor white neighborhoods as well.
[00:44:48.527 --> 00:45:01.614]  They'd stick it in the poor Irish neighborhoods and say, the dirty Irish, they got gambling and hookers and everything else and drinking those Irish scum, while meanwhile it was all being stuck in their neighborhood.
[00:45:01.614 --> 00:45:04.916]  It's the same story over and over and over again.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.582]  It isn't even about what color you are or religion.
[00:45:08.582 --> 00:45:14.067]  In every country, they'll have some subgroup that they park all the crime in, and then they blame that group.
[00:45:14.067 --> 00:45:21.534]  You go back to Rome 2,000 years ago, they would stick the vice and the corruption in the neighborhoods of the minority groups.
[00:45:21.534 --> 00:45:25.577]  The Greeks, or the Gauls, or the North Africans.
[00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:29.741]  They all had their own neighborhoods, and they would stick it in that neighborhood.
[00:45:29.741 --> 00:45:30.542]  That's what you do.
[00:45:33.294 --> 00:45:36.916]  And so we're going to explore the social engineering because it's done on so many levels.
[00:45:36.916 --> 00:45:45.260]  And if you ever start thinking about what is the social engineering, and you ever start wanting to understand it, it's not work to learn.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.061]  They make textbooks in school boring.
[00:45:47.061 --> 00:45:50.502]  They don't put really interesting stuff in there because you might get addicted to knowledge.
[00:45:50.502 --> 00:45:54.024]  And then it just opens up and you learn how the world works.
[00:45:54.024 --> 00:45:59.727]  And even if you're a sociopath or a psychopath, this knowledge of how the world works
[00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:03.053]  Can make you incredibly successful.
[00:46:03.053 --> 00:46:03.814]  Going to college?
[00:46:03.814 --> 00:46:04.835]  Give me a break.
[00:46:04.835 --> 00:46:09.239]  That's just to meet people and maybe get a job at a company because you date the right person.
[00:46:09.239 --> 00:46:11.280]  Or you're in the right fraternity.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.984]  Nine times out of ten, college is worthless unless it's engineering or law or something.
[00:46:15.984 --> 00:46:17.366]  All the liberal arts?
[00:46:17.366 --> 00:46:19.267]  There is no jobs for that in the future.
[00:46:19.267 --> 00:46:20.488]  I'm not attacking you.
[00:46:20.488 --> 00:46:21.449]  It's a scam.
[00:46:21.449 --> 00:46:23.351]  We told you 20 years ago it was a scam.
[00:46:23.351 --> 00:46:24.732]  Now it's an admitted scam.
[00:46:24.732 --> 00:46:26.574]  They charge you more than you'll ever make.
[00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:35.427]  And it's a way for you just to keep being a kid till you're 25, 30 and not go out and actually see what's going on in the world.
[00:46:35.427 --> 00:46:41.714]  Social engineering.
[00:46:41.714 --> 00:46:43.716]  India, mass sterilization.
[00:46:43.716 --> 00:46:46.500]  Women were forced into camps, say relatives.
[00:46:49.107 --> 00:46:56.531]  Brother-in-law, one of the victims says women were herded like cattle after 12 die and scores injured following botched operations.
[00:46:56.531 --> 00:46:58.473]  Yeah, they're actually cutting their uteruses out.
[00:46:58.473 --> 00:47:06.757]  You know, it came out a few years ago that in California and other states they were still sterilizing women secretly.
[00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:09.519]  There's a free government-run camp, but it comes and rounds you up.
[00:47:09.519 --> 00:47:12.481]  This is a whitewash on The Guardian.
[00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:13.041]  Here's another one.
[00:47:13.041 --> 00:47:13.441]  24 reasons
[00:47:18.575 --> 00:47:19.155]  Look at this.
[00:47:19.155 --> 00:47:20.116]  India.
[00:47:20.116 --> 00:47:21.116]  Mass sterilization.
[00:47:21.116 --> 00:47:23.917]  Women were forced into camps, say relatives.
[00:47:23.917 --> 00:47:26.698]  Depopulation vaccine in Kenya and beyond.
[00:47:26.698 --> 00:47:31.820]  Kenya's Catholic bishops are charging two United Nations organizations with sterilizing millions of girls.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.501]  We have all the documents where they do it.
[00:47:33.501 --> 00:47:34.442]  And women.
[00:47:34.442 --> 00:47:42.525]  Kenya's Catholic bishops are charging two United Nations organizations with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of anti-tetanus inoculation program sponsored by the Kenyan government.
[00:47:43.789 --> 00:47:47.971]  It was given to 2.3 million girls and now they're sterilized.
[00:47:47.971 --> 00:47:56.635]  Well yeah, the UN got caught adding a hormone to it to create an autoimmune response to that hormone, thus causing spontaneous miscarriages at the start of the second trimester.
[00:47:56.635 --> 00:48:02.618]  The article goes through the documents, newscast, the UN basically admitting it.
[00:48:02.618 --> 00:48:05.480]  So just thought you might want to go read those stories.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.440]  They're up on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.101]  You just heard
[00:48:09.747 --> 00:48:11.389]  Leanne's report on that.
[00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:15.153]  Is the UN using vaccines to secretly sterilize women all over the world?
[00:48:15.153 --> 00:48:15.534]  I don't know.
[00:48:15.534 --> 00:48:20.279]  Do bears go to the bathroom in the woods?
[00:48:20.279 --> 00:48:25.185]  Michael Schneider's got an article on that, breaking it down.
[00:48:25.185 --> 00:48:27.187]  And let's move on to why they want to stoop it.
[00:48:28.018 --> 00:48:31.019]  People are going to be in for a shock.
[00:48:31.019 --> 00:48:37.921]  Penalty for uninsured not signing up for Obamacare to more than triple now that the midterm elections are over.
[00:48:37.921 --> 00:48:44.162]  CBS News from InsuranceQuotes.com Senior Analyst!
[00:48:44.162 --> 00:48:45.683]  You think doubling was bad?
[00:48:45.683 --> 00:48:50.364]  How about quadruple?
[00:48:50.364 --> 00:48:52.505]  You thought a 500% increase was too much?
[00:48:52.505 --> 00:48:53.025]  Well...
[00:48:55.828 --> 00:49:02.274]  A second video emerges of Obamacare architect calling Americans stupid.
[00:49:02.274 --> 00:49:08.779]  Gruber paid $400,000 by administration, visited White House a dozen times.
[00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:18.507]  Despite telling MSNBC that his comments were off the cuff, a second video has emerged of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber saying the laws were passed because Americans were too stupid to understand it.
[00:49:18.507 --> 00:49:22.091]  Yeah, he said we kept it untransparent and that of them being stupid, we got it through.
[00:49:22.824 --> 00:49:24.725]  And that's why a lack of transparency is key.
[00:49:24.725 --> 00:49:38.691]  During an appearance on the Ronan Farrow Daily, Grubber tried to explain away the initial comments by claiming he was speaking off the cuff when he said that a lack of transparency was crucial in fooling stupid Americans during the effort to pass Obamacare.
[00:49:38.691 --> 00:49:39.371]  That's right.
[00:49:39.371 --> 00:49:43.813]  And you'll just sit there and lecture everyone, Gruber, that it isn't increasing, right?
[00:49:43.813 --> 00:49:44.353]  Even though it is.
[00:49:44.753 --> 00:49:48.816]  Your bill comes in, it's bigger, but it isn't bigger, because you said so, you control reality.
[00:49:48.816 --> 00:49:53.340]  Let's go to his first quote that they tried to censor, then we have the new one to his students.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.301]  It's just, you can't do it, politically.
[00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:56.923]  You just literally cannot do it.
[00:49:56.923 --> 00:50:01.246]  Okay, transparent financing, and let's not just transparent financing, also transparent spending.
[00:50:01.246 --> 00:50:07.831]  I mean, this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.
[00:50:07.831 --> 00:50:09.713]  If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.
[00:50:10.533 --> 00:50:12.794]  Okay, so it's written to do that.
[00:50:12.794 --> 00:50:21.658]  In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you get a law which said healthy people are going to pay in, it made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.
[00:50:21.658 --> 00:50:27.681]  Okay, just like the people, lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:31.363]  And basically, you know, falsely supporting the American voter or whatever.
[00:50:31.363 --> 00:50:35.445]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[00:50:35.445 --> 00:50:37.125]  And you know, it's the second best argument.
[00:50:37.125 --> 00:50:38.286]  Look, I wish Mark was right.
[00:50:39.625 --> 00:50:46.428]  Now, let's go to his newest clip to his students, and then we also have him on MSNBC.
[00:50:46.428 --> 00:50:53.412]  But here is Gruber, yet again, saying the same thing.
[00:51:04.318 --> 00:51:13.842]  And see, they're teaching the college students all over America that you lie, you deceive, you're a ruling class that feeds on them.
[00:51:13.842 --> 00:51:24.287]  When they're all there paying 9 times out of 10 for a $300,000 degree, with interest it'll be $600,000, that you'll not get a job with.
[00:51:24.287 --> 00:51:25.448]  And that you've been chumped.
[00:51:27.227 --> 00:51:30.190]  But then they walk out like, oh, I'm so smart.
[00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.835]  I don't know anyone out there more arrogant than professors I know.
[00:51:33.835 --> 00:51:35.797]  There's some good professors.
[00:51:35.797 --> 00:51:45.949]  I don't want to overgeneralize, but let's say 70% are on unbelievable power trips and are so arrogant, it'll just blow your mind.
[00:51:48.305 --> 00:52:00.131]  Because they're egomaniac narcissists that just have people groveling all day to go in and hear them walk around and talk about, yeah, we keep things secret and twisted when we rip them off and massively increase their prices.
[00:52:00.131 --> 00:52:05.593]  This is so stupid!
[00:52:05.593 --> 00:52:06.894]  Because that's all they've got.
[00:52:06.894 --> 00:52:08.255]  They relish this.
[00:52:10.558 --> 00:52:15.601]  And then I've got Bill Gates saying, yeah, we've got death panels, but we don't want to call it that.
[00:52:15.601 --> 00:52:16.501]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:52:16.501 --> 00:52:18.482]  And yeah, we want to reduce the population down to zero.
[00:52:18.482 --> 00:52:19.362]  Here's the equation.
[00:52:19.362 --> 00:52:21.604]  And then the TED TV crowd laughs.
[00:52:21.604 --> 00:52:25.065]  Because, see, they're in on the club.
[00:52:25.065 --> 00:52:32.789]  You get behind closed doors with almost any medical doctor or any scientist or any professor, I mean, most of them, and you say, you know, there are too many people.
[00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:34.210]  We need to go ahead and forcefully reduce.
[00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:35.831]  They're like, yeah, you're right.
[00:52:37.067 --> 00:52:38.247]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:38.247 --> 00:52:39.608]  Let's not think of ways to fix it.
[00:52:39.608 --> 00:52:41.268]  Let's not think of ways to make it better.
[00:52:41.268 --> 00:52:42.148]  No, no.
[00:52:42.148 --> 00:52:49.130]  Did you read the Royal Commission on Population, 1949, commissioned by His Royal Highness Elizabeth II's father?
[00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:50.831]  Did you read the 200-page report?
[00:52:50.831 --> 00:52:52.651]  I did.
[00:52:52.651 --> 00:52:58.252]  I saw it in a footnote in a LaRouche publication, and then I went to the UT library and actually dug it out.
[00:52:58.252 --> 00:53:02.193]  That was back before the Internet was big and powerful, like in 1996.
[00:53:02.193 --> 00:53:03.454]  And I read the whole report.
[00:53:03.454 --> 00:53:04.354]  I covered it on television.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.341]  I'm going to dig that tape up.
[00:53:06.341 --> 00:53:09.363]  It's documents in one of these storage facilities.
[00:53:09.363 --> 00:53:13.185]  I got a copy of it off the microfiche.
[00:53:13.185 --> 00:53:18.148]  And they said right there, we could fix what we call overpopulation.
[00:53:18.148 --> 00:53:20.630]  Let's just say it's real for the matter of a debate.
[00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:27.514]  But that would then give decentralization power of industrialization and technological development that we can't control.
[00:53:27.514 --> 00:53:29.576]  We'd already be on space bases by now.
[00:53:29.576 --> 00:53:30.817]  If we give it to all these countries.
[00:53:30.817 --> 00:53:34.179]  So we need to just go in with the UN taxation, IMF, World Bank.
[00:53:34.699 --> 00:53:36.560]  Development type funds, they didn't call it that.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.022]  Global Marshall plans to control everything.
[00:53:40.022 --> 00:53:47.145]  And go ahead and let the population bloom, keep it third world, and then mitigate it later once that crisis has grown.
[00:53:47.145 --> 00:53:53.508]  And once you understand the dark math, the logic of these Satanists, it makes perfect sense.
[00:53:55.501 --> 00:53:58.543]  Again, they always create the crisis they're worried about.
[00:53:58.543 --> 00:54:17.296]  That they're trying to get you to then ideologically travel in the Peace Corps when you're in college to India and see dead bodies on the streets and fleas everywhere and rats everywhere and huge piles of feces just everywhere.
[00:54:17.296 --> 00:54:20.678]  And huge throngs of people and women being raped all over the place.
[00:54:20.678 --> 00:54:25.061]  I mean, India is a living hell.
[00:54:27.162 --> 00:54:29.784]  A living hell in the major cities.
[00:54:29.784 --> 00:54:35.507]  It's beautiful in many areas, has a lot of interesting culture, but they've got a billion, 100 million people.
[00:54:35.507 --> 00:54:36.428]  Let's see if my memory's right.
[00:54:36.428 --> 00:54:38.029]  I think it's a billion, 100 million now.
[00:54:38.029 --> 00:54:39.490]  China's 1.3 billion.
[00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:43.713]  Let's look up the current population of India.
[00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:46.074]  It's like half the size of China.
[00:54:46.074 --> 00:54:48.315]  And it is a crisis.
[00:54:48.315 --> 00:54:49.316]  Oh, it's bigger than I thought.
[00:54:49.316 --> 00:54:49.716]  It's 1.25 billion.
[00:54:52.717 --> 00:54:56.258]  So it's a billion and almost the population of the U.S.
[00:54:56.258 --> 00:54:59.280]  added on.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.360]  So you say, well, the U.N.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.921]  then is doing what they have to.
[00:55:01.921 --> 00:55:05.282]  But once you set the precedent to have the U.N.
[00:55:05.282 --> 00:55:13.465]  and all these health agencies in on secret projects that even go public in the 90s, they admitted, yeah, we're sterilizing women with a tetanus shot.
[00:55:13.465 --> 00:55:15.766]  They're doing it to everybody.
[00:55:15.766 --> 00:55:22.149]  See, I have empathy for these Indians, not just because I know at an intellectual level it's going to come back on me.
[00:55:24.124 --> 00:55:26.166]  That what can be done to them is going to happen to me?
[00:55:26.166 --> 00:55:31.470]  My default already knows that, so I have empathy for them.
[00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:37.496]  Does it mean that I want to bring in a 50 million of them as a strategic group to work for half of what I'll work for?
[00:55:37.496 --> 00:55:39.577]  To make me a debt slave too?
[00:55:39.577 --> 00:55:40.939]  No, no, no, no.
[00:55:40.939 --> 00:55:47.624]  I love them as humans, but they are a weapon being fired at our country.
[00:55:47.624 --> 00:55:48.085]  See the difference?
[00:55:51.155 --> 00:55:57.599]  Just like I don't want to sterilize the Mexican women with a Gardasil shot that is sterilizing many of them, reducing fertility.
[00:55:57.599 --> 00:55:59.501]  It's a soft kill.
[00:55:59.501 --> 00:56:00.662]  On record, look it up.
[00:56:00.662 --> 00:56:01.943]  HPV.
[00:56:01.943 --> 00:56:05.325]  Mandated by law in Mexico.
[00:56:05.325 --> 00:56:12.430]  You'll never hear Mecha or La Raza, the Hispanic Ku Klux Klan groups, saying don't sterilize our girls.
[00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:13.491]  Because they're there.
[00:56:13.491 --> 00:56:14.511]  Why do you think Fortune 500 funds them?
[00:56:15.936 --> 00:56:23.159]  To make it a racial group that never learns English, the world language, that can be kept in barrios under their El Jefe control.
[00:56:23.159 --> 00:56:24.080]  To make the U.S.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.201]  just like a failed state like Mexico.
[00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:32.964]  I'd like to see Mexico filthy rich with huge glistening buildings and is just a jewel of a country.
[00:56:32.964 --> 00:56:35.025]  I'd love to see their people wealthy.
[00:56:35.025 --> 00:56:36.025]  I want to be like that.
[00:56:36.025 --> 00:56:37.086]  I want everybody to succeed.
[00:56:41.049 --> 00:56:43.410]  Yeah, there's the headline, South China Morning Post.
[00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:46.592]  Hundreds of girls in Colombian towns sick after taking Gardasil vaccine.
[00:56:46.592 --> 00:56:48.352]  Yeah, it isn't hundreds, folks.
[00:56:48.352 --> 00:56:49.273]  That's a PSYOP.
[00:56:49.273 --> 00:56:52.734]  They always give you the low number.
[00:56:52.734 --> 00:57:00.258]  It's okay, you take the shot and then you have such a bad autoimmune response inside your body that blood pours out of you.
[00:57:00.258 --> 00:57:02.479]  But you're not going to have to worry about babies, sweetheart.
[00:57:03.968 --> 00:57:11.587]  But you're not going to hear the race talking about that because they were founded by the Ford Foundation to destroy Hispanics' future.
[00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:19.772]  Just like the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, all these groups at the top are social engineers.
[00:57:19.772 --> 00:57:21.233]  They're to sell everyone out.
[00:57:21.233 --> 00:57:22.133]  Period.
[00:57:22.133 --> 00:57:27.135]  And the minute you start realizing that, that we're all in this together, is the minute we can turn this planet around.
[00:57:27.135 --> 00:57:31.456]  Industrialize these countries, reduce population, or create clean technologies.
[00:57:31.456 --> 00:57:38.839]  But they bring in all these fake clean technologies that are just boondoggles meant to make sure the rest of the planet doesn't get the real technology.
[00:57:42.108 --> 00:57:42.828]  So frustrating.
[00:57:42.828 --> 00:57:45.750]  I'm so angry about it.
[00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:46.790]  We're going to go to break.
[00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:48.571]  Come back with some more news.
[00:57:48.571 --> 00:57:52.493]  And Frederick Ross is going to be joining us.
[00:57:52.493 --> 00:58:01.898]  White House says Obama is looking forward to executive action on immigration, North American Union, end of sovereignty, free welfare for the illegals, bankrupt the country.
[00:58:01.898 --> 00:58:05.660]  That's the plan.
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:09.322]  Boehner says Republicans blast job-crushing emissions deal with China.
[00:58:11.778 --> 00:58:16.080]  Oh yeah, Obama doesn't care, he's going ahead with the carbon taxes on you and your family.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.161]  Enjoy!

[00:58:51.314 --> 00:58:52.575]  Another major health threat.
[00:58:52.575 --> 00:58:57.557]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:58:57.557 --> 00:59:00.238]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:59:00.238 --> 00:59:07.281]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:07.281 --> 00:59:10.262]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:10.262 --> 00:59:13.224]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:13.224 --> 00:59:15.245]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:15.245 --> 00:59:18.086]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:18.166 --> 00:59:23.890]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:27.393]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:27.393 --> 00:59:30.495]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:00:05.874 --> 01:00:07.176]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.176 --> 01:00:08.938]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:10.700]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.302]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.302 --> 01:00:13.824]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.824 --> 01:00:18.029]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:22.094]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.747 --> 01:00:30.427]  Touchdown!
[01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:35.851]  Jubilation as the Rosetta mission is a success.
[01:00:35.851 --> 01:00:41.355]  Landing on a comet traveling 34,000 miles per hour towards the sun.
[01:00:41.355 --> 01:00:44.236]  That's the stuff dreams are made of.
[01:00:44.236 --> 01:00:46.238]  Well, we got Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:00:47.571 --> 01:00:49.492]  The biggest coke dealer probably in U.S.
[01:00:49.492 --> 01:00:55.954]  history ever, quote, busted joining us to blow the history of CIA drug trafficking wide open.
[01:00:55.954 --> 01:00:58.095]  Of course, the big movie, Kill the Messenger.
[01:00:58.095 --> 01:01:02.856]  Guys, give me the IMDb printout on that, please.
[01:01:02.856 --> 01:01:08.018]  Also portrays Ross Innott, and he's here with us in Austin, Texas.
[01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:13.371]  Before he goes to speak to some college students up in Dallas.
[01:01:13.371 --> 01:01:16.011]  And we're going to be, I've been talking to him since he was in prison.
[01:01:16.011 --> 01:01:18.132]  He's been in prison 25 years.
[01:01:18.132 --> 01:01:19.652]  But he's going to be in studio with us.
[01:01:19.652 --> 01:01:20.452]  I haven't even met him yet.
[01:01:20.452 --> 01:01:21.673]  He came in last night.
[01:01:21.673 --> 01:01:23.233]  He's been out with the crew.
[01:01:23.233 --> 01:01:30.214]  He just arrived and so he'll be in studio with us coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:30.214 --> 01:01:31.015]  Well breaking!
[01:01:31.015 --> 01:01:31.535]  The U.S.
[01:01:31.535 --> 01:01:35.295]  and China just announced a huge deal on climate.
[01:01:35.295 --> 01:01:37.156]  You mean a huge tax deal like Obamacare?
[01:01:38.021 --> 01:01:41.804]  Or the plan to take over the internet and tax it and regulate it, to protect it.
[01:01:41.804 --> 01:01:43.385]  Obamacare for the internet.
[01:01:43.385 --> 01:01:44.105]  A huge decision.
[01:01:44.105 --> 01:01:47.728]  He's getting ready on the internet, on carbon taxes, on your guns.
[01:01:47.728 --> 01:01:54.032]  With the UN treaty he says he'll honor that goes in December 24th, a little Christmas present.
[01:01:54.032 --> 01:01:55.253]  Wide open borders.
[01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:56.514]  Going after your guns.
[01:01:56.514 --> 01:01:58.155]  Going after your energy prices.
[01:01:58.155 --> 01:01:59.897]  Going after you with carbon taxes.
[01:01:59.897 --> 01:02:02.118]  Going after you, going after you, going after you.
[01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:04.240]  Going after Fast Track to sign over sovereignty.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.881]  Republican leadership involved in that.
[01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:07.477]  The U.S.
[01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:10.539]  and China just announced a huge deal on climate!
[01:02:10.539 --> 01:02:12.980]  Yeah!
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:15.682]  And it's a game-changer, Mother Jones reports.
[01:02:15.682 --> 01:02:17.003]  Oh, yes!
[01:02:17.003 --> 01:02:27.489]  The surprise agreement, you mean the sneak attack, aims to double the price of carbon pollution reduction in the United States only!
[01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:29.109]  What a great deal!
[01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:35.033]  You make it harder to work and have factories here, and force it over to China that always signs on but doesn't comply.
[01:02:36.246 --> 01:02:37.527]  Dirty coal power plants.
[01:02:37.527 --> 01:02:38.748]  Three being built a week.
[01:02:38.748 --> 01:02:40.309]  We have more than three being shut down a week.
[01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:41.811]  Clean ones.
[01:02:41.811 --> 01:02:44.993]  What a day, you Obama!
[01:02:44.993 --> 01:02:49.557]  Wow, our electricity already costs five times what it does in China.
[01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.298]  So no wonder no one wants to build.
[01:02:51.298 --> 01:02:52.760]  Thank you, yeah!
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.701]  Let's make it ten times!
[01:02:54.701 --> 01:02:57.323]  Oh man, Obama, what a great deal!
[01:02:57.323 --> 01:03:01.327]  Make our energy ten times more expensive than Chinese coal power energy.
[01:03:03.737 --> 01:03:07.820]  And the average American goes, I don't own coal stocks, I don't have a coal stove.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:14.385]  All you electric car people with your volts and all of you that are like, look at that gasoline guzzling truck.
[01:03:14.385 --> 01:03:16.687]  Oh, and you got your electric lawnmowers.
[01:03:16.687 --> 01:03:22.191]  It comes from coal, coal, coal, coal, coal, coal, coal.
[01:03:24.454 --> 01:03:28.518]  I mean, this is like a bandit blowing the race car engine before the race.
[01:03:28.518 --> 01:03:35.285]  Obama's driving the Chinese race car, and he comes over and like throws a hand grenade in the engine, and we go, oh, thank you!
[01:03:35.285 --> 01:03:38.269]  The engine just, boom, blows up.
[01:03:38.269 --> 01:03:40.691]  He's like, wait, the engine didn't totally blow?
[01:03:40.691 --> 01:03:44.135]  Throw an Obamacare hand grenade in there.
[01:03:44.135 --> 01:03:46.217]  Bring in 60 million illegals to bankrupt things.
[01:03:46.217 --> 01:03:46.998]  Another hand grenade.
[01:03:48.251 --> 01:03:52.272]  The thing is, the country was so rich and so powerful, they just can't blow the engine.
[01:03:52.272 --> 01:03:54.213]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:03:54.213 --> 01:03:55.353]  You filth!
[01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:59.374]  And we've got 60 million people refusing to pay the income tax, keeping the economy going.
[01:03:59.374 --> 01:04:01.154]  It's meant to shut it off.
[01:04:01.154 --> 01:04:02.075]  Oh, you filth.
[01:04:02.075 --> 01:04:03.495]  You trash.
[01:04:03.495 --> 01:04:04.255]  You scum.
[01:04:04.255 --> 01:04:06.356]  I mean, this country's under total attack.
[01:04:07.236 --> 01:04:22.186]  In a surprise announcement last night, the world's two biggest economies and greenhouse gas emitters, the United States and China, said they will partner closely on a broad-ranging package of plans to fight climate change, including new targets to reduce carbon pollution, according to a statement from the White House.
[01:04:22.186 --> 01:04:25.349]  But it's going to start out with doubling the price in the U.S.
[01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:26.990]  because we're the leader in that.
[01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:28.531]  Look at Obama smiling.
[01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.471]  Can you imagine?
[01:04:29.471 --> 01:04:32.914]  Oh, because they don't just cut the power off, they then charge you more for it.
[01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:43.842]  Alright folks, we're going to go to break now.
[01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:50.365]  And when we return, Freeway Ricky Ross, the real Rick Ross, in studio.
[01:04:50.365 --> 01:04:56.649]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, follow us on Twitter, RealAlexJones.
[01:04:56.649 --> 01:04:57.109]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.656 --> 01:05:08.301]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:08.301 --> 01:05:13.444]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:13.444 --> 01:05:22.170]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:24.652]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:24.652 --> 01:05:28.375]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:05:30.498 --> 01:05:35.261]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:39.084]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:05:39.084 --> 01:05:40.325]  Others don't.
[01:05:40.325 --> 01:05:42.467]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:42.467 --> 01:05:44.248]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:44.248 --> 01:05:47.130]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:53.754]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:53.754 --> 01:05:56.476]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:56.476 --> 01:05:58.838]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:05:58.838 --> 01:05:59.639]  Others don't.
[01:06:02.006 --> 01:06:03.346]  In the near future.
[01:06:03.346 --> 01:06:07.848]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:07.848 --> 01:06:09.068]  Security alert.
[01:06:09.068 --> 01:06:11.069]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.969]  Analysis.
[01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:12.669]  InfoWars.
[01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:14.650]  Building independent media operations.
[01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:19.651]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:19.651 --> 01:06:20.691]  Crime directive.
[01:06:20.691 --> 01:06:22.232]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.232 --> 01:06:25.092]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:25.092 --> 01:06:28.333]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:28.333 --> 01:06:30.494]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:32.155]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:34.976]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:34.976 --> 01:06:36.938]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:36.938 --> 01:06:40.980]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:44.602]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:44.602 --> 01:06:47.944]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:06:47.944 --> 01:06:48.945]  Imperative.
[01:06:48.945 --> 01:06:50.966]  Destroy Little Planet TV.
[01:06:50.966 --> 01:06:55.488]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:55.488 --> 01:06:57.009]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:06:57.009 --> 01:06:57.770]  You can feel it.
[01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:02.696]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:07:02.696 --> 01:07:07.237]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:07:07.237 --> 01:07:11.698]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:07:11.698 --> 01:07:19.000]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:28.063]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:07:28.303 --> 01:07:33.847]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:07:33.847 --> 01:07:41.432]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:44.014]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:07:44.014 --> 01:07:49.138]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWood.

[01:08:01.205 --> 01:08:10.070]  Yet our best trained, best educated, best equipped, best prepared troops refuse to fight.
[01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:16.334]  Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch than fight.
[01:08:17.486 --> 01:08:19.606]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:19.606 --> 01:08:38.730]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:43.291]  Alright folks, we're broadcasting worldwide now into the second hour.
[01:08:43.291 --> 01:08:46.132]  Coming up in the third hour, we're going to open the phones up for listeners.
[01:08:46.132 --> 01:08:46.732]  Your chance.
[01:08:47.982 --> 01:08:51.684]  To talk to Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:08:51.684 --> 01:08:58.709]  And of course, Rick Ross has been recognized as a major pawn of the CIA drug war game.
[01:08:58.709 --> 01:09:01.190]  He was a pioneer in the crack cocaine trade in Los Angeles.
[01:09:01.190 --> 01:09:06.914]  Ross harvested millions of dollars a day as an unknown participant of the CIA and U.S.
[01:09:06.914 --> 01:09:09.455]  Drug Enforcement Agency ops.
[01:09:09.455 --> 01:09:13.318]  And then long after he got out of it, they still set him up and sent him to prison.
[01:09:13.318 --> 01:09:15.019]  And here's my issue.
[01:09:18.433 --> 01:09:25.137]  It's the government that made narcotics illegal when prohibition ended of alcohol because they needed another business to skim off of.
[01:09:25.137 --> 01:09:26.118]  That's on record.
[01:09:26.118 --> 01:09:29.620]  They've been shipping the narcotics into this country since they made them illegal.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:36.404]  You could buy cocaine, heroin, speed, anything under different names at the drugstore.
[01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:41.968]  You would go and get coke syrup, cocaine syrup, shot into your, quote, tonic.
[01:09:41.968 --> 01:09:43.129]  That's where soft drinks came from.
[01:09:44.968 --> 01:09:51.569]  I know I had family that, you know, basically worked in that business up in Waco, where Dr. Pepper comes from.
[01:09:51.569 --> 01:09:52.709]  It had cocaine in it, too.
[01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:56.410]  In fact, one of my ancestors actually named Dr. Pepper.
[01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:59.651]  The point is, doctor will pep you up.
[01:09:59.651 --> 01:10:02.791]  So, this guy has been a Dr. Pepper as well.
[01:10:02.791 --> 01:10:12.833]  You make it illegal, though, it brings all the prostitution, it brings all the money laundering, it brings all the exploitation into it and makes it dirty.
[01:10:13.493 --> 01:10:16.115]  And how are you going to legalize slavery again in this country?
[01:10:16.115 --> 01:10:22.260]  How are you going to scoop up 3, 4, 5 million people and throw them in jail every year and take their rights away?
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.742]  You do it by putting something highly addictive.
[01:10:24.742 --> 01:10:27.044]  Beer is addictive, we're going to lock them up for that.
[01:10:27.044 --> 01:10:30.186]  Fast food is addictive, we're going to lock you up for that.
[01:10:30.186 --> 01:10:34.310]  They throw it out, hope people pick up the adulterated poison.
[01:10:35.928 --> 01:10:36.188]  I don't
[01:10:57.862 --> 01:10:59.223]  On record.
[01:10:59.223 --> 01:11:01.424]  And Rick Ross could have shot up about the CIA.
[01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:02.424]  He could have gone along.
[01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:04.305]  They wouldn't have given him a life sentence.
[01:11:04.305 --> 01:11:06.106]  I remember interviewing Gary Webb.
[01:11:06.106 --> 01:11:11.088]  He's got the big Renner film out right now.
[01:11:11.088 --> 01:11:14.169]  Of course, kill the messenger, dealing with it.
[01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.990]  And I remember talking to Webb.
[01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:18.011]  He was going to come on in a few months.
[01:11:18.011 --> 01:11:20.072]  And he gave me a disc with all his documents.
[01:11:21.641 --> 01:11:26.605]  And he was going to have a new book coming out to vindicate everything he'd done, everything he'd said.
[01:11:26.605 --> 01:11:29.367]  He won all sorts of prizes, you name it.
[01:11:29.367 --> 01:11:35.191]  But his editors and the LA Times, run by the CIA, that was declassified two months ago.
[01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:38.134]  The CIA did target him with a disinformation campaign.
[01:11:38.134 --> 01:11:40.255]  They did lie and say he was discredited.
[01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:42.797]  He would never admit he was discredited because it wasn't true.
[01:11:42.797 --> 01:11:45.319]  And before he could vindicate himself, they killed him.
[01:11:45.319 --> 01:11:50.303]  Now, why would the CIA declassify that a month before the film came out two months ago?
[01:11:52.105 --> 01:11:55.753]  Why would they do something like that?
[01:11:55.753 --> 01:12:00.242]  Well, I'm gonna ask Rick Ross that question, but...
[01:12:01.738 --> 01:12:04.700]  I really think it's because it's already so well known.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:14.026]  It's even on Fox News that our troops grow the opium and load it on C-130s and then it comes here and then it goes through people like Ross that are intermediaries.
[01:12:14.026 --> 01:12:19.089]  It goes CIA to the black front because it's the black man bringing us the drugs.
[01:12:19.089 --> 01:12:20.610]  He's the bad guy.
[01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:22.351]  Not the CIA.
[01:12:22.351 --> 01:12:23.352]  Not the establishment.
[01:12:24.815 --> 01:12:26.876]  It's the Tony Montana type.
[01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:27.676]  It's the Cuban.
[01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:28.437]  He's behind it.
[01:12:28.437 --> 01:12:29.397]  It's the black guy.
[01:12:29.397 --> 01:12:33.319]  Or it's the white trash guy in the trailer selling the drugs.
[01:12:33.319 --> 01:12:36.161]  No, it's not.
[01:12:36.161 --> 01:12:39.002]  And as the economy shuts down, more people want the drugs.
[01:12:39.002 --> 01:12:40.583]  Your daughter gets hooked on them.
[01:12:40.583 --> 01:12:42.204]  Now she's a topless dancer.
[01:12:42.204 --> 01:12:43.985]  Then she's a hooker.
[01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:45.966]  This is how you bring down society.
[01:12:45.966 --> 01:12:49.147]  And then you've got SWAT teams running around paramilitary for the war on drugs.
[01:12:49.147 --> 01:12:51.448]  You've got the Patriot Act they're using for the war on drugs.
[01:12:51.448 --> 01:12:54.330]  Merging it all together so everyone's under suspicion.
[01:12:56.158 --> 01:12:58.919]  Your daughter hurts her back in a volleyball accident.
[01:12:58.919 --> 01:13:01.180]  I once had one of my friends when she was 16.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.621]  Two years later, she's addicted to pain pills.
[01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:05.361]  Goes around doctor shopping to get the things.
[01:13:05.361 --> 01:13:08.103]  Instead of getting treatment, they throw her in jail.
[01:13:08.103 --> 01:13:10.203]  Then she gets in with bad people.
[01:13:10.203 --> 01:13:16.806]  Next she comes out with an education in criminal activity after a year and becomes, you guessed it, a streetwalker.
[01:13:17.711 --> 01:13:20.913]  This is how you kill a civilization.
[01:13:20.913 --> 01:13:23.615]  This is how you annihilate a culture.
[01:13:23.615 --> 01:13:25.957]  This is how you bring a country down.
[01:13:25.957 --> 01:13:38.746]  So a minority of people in the YouTube comments and on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com said, what are you doing having a huge cocaine dealer on your show?
[01:13:38.746 --> 01:13:41.808]  Okay, what are you doing putting up with a government that went and hired him?
[01:13:43.399 --> 01:13:45.141]  See, there's no outrage about that.
[01:13:45.141 --> 01:13:49.585]  There's no outrage about the big banks laundering $386 billion in two years.
[01:13:49.585 --> 01:13:51.847]  Bloomberg reported, two banks alone.
[01:13:51.847 --> 01:13:55.390]  Wells Fargo, Wachovia, $380 plus billion.
[01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:56.471]  Type it in.
[01:13:56.471 --> 01:13:59.133]  Big banks laundered $300 plus billion.
[01:13:59.133 --> 01:14:02.016]  It'll pop up Bloomberg, AP, you name it, from four years ago.
[01:14:02.016 --> 01:14:02.917]  That's just one admission.
[01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:03.618]  They paid a $111 million fine.
[01:14:05.759 --> 01:14:08.940]  That's like if you rob a bank for a million bucks paying a $3,000 fine.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.881]  It's a slap on the wrist.
[01:14:10.881 --> 01:14:14.962]  It's not a slap on the wrist, it's like them flicking a penny after they robbed a bank to the cops.
[01:14:14.962 --> 01:14:20.023]  You walk out, the cops open the truck up, help you load the stolen money, and you throw them a quarter.
[01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:21.184]  That's what this is.
[01:14:21.184 --> 01:14:22.964]  That's how this system works.
[01:14:22.964 --> 01:14:31.307]  And now it's expanding the racket with all the psych testing in the schools and the drugging of the kids that way to get them into the system.
[01:14:34.415 --> 01:14:46.038]  I am the real Rick Ross dot com, Freeway Rick dot com, Freeway Rick Ross, and I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but in 96 they were getting, he hadn't dealt drugs in years, they were getting rid of everybody.
[01:14:46.038 --> 01:14:48.559]  See, they always flush the people that work for him.
[01:14:48.559 --> 01:14:54.360]  He was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of trying to purchase more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:15:03.203]  Ross became the subject of controversy later that year when a series of articles by journalist Gary Webb and the San Jose Mercury brought to light a connection between one of Ross' cocaine sources
[01:15:04.574 --> 01:15:07.575]  And the CIA as part of the Iran-Contra scandal.
[01:15:07.575 --> 01:15:12.917]  His sentencing was later reduced to less than 20 years and released in September 2009.
[01:15:12.917 --> 01:15:17.778]  He's finally off the probation, the harassment, all of it.
[01:15:17.778 --> 01:15:19.459]  Able to put his book out that's excellent.
[01:15:19.459 --> 01:15:22.420]  We're selling it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.961]  Even if you already know all this, give this to friends and family.
[01:15:24.961 --> 01:15:31.683]  He is currently in the process of creating a feature-length film for his live story, Cracking the System, and creating his
[01:15:32.503 --> 01:15:44.527]  Autobiographical book which is now out and that is Freeway Rick Ross the Untold Autobiography by Rick Ross with Kathy Scott available right now at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling 888-253-3139
[01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:51.281]  I admire Rick Ross, because I talked to Gary Webb about it.
[01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:56.727]  When this came out about the CIA and his trial, he didn't really know about it, he was blown away, everything suddenly made sense.
[01:15:56.727 --> 01:16:01.052]  They said, just shut up, don't cooperate with this reporter and people, and we'll go easy.
[01:16:01.052 --> 01:16:03.214]  He didn't, so they gave him life in prison.
[01:16:03.214 --> 01:16:06.538]  That was clearly done politically, so it was reduced.
[01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:08.855]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:16:08.855 --> 01:16:11.016]  The issue is he's repented of it.
[01:16:11.016 --> 01:16:13.737]  The CIA and the New World Order haven't.
[01:16:13.737 --> 01:16:17.718]  So he joins us now until the end of the transmission, the next hour and 45 minutes.
[01:16:17.718 --> 01:16:20.419]  We'll open the phones up for Rick Ross next hour.
[01:16:20.419 --> 01:16:24.100]  But Rick, it was like sunny and 80 degrees a few days ago.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:29.122]  Sorry you gotta be in Austin when this global warming cold front hits, but thank you so much for coming.
[01:16:29.122 --> 01:16:31.683]  No, I'm just blown away to be here.
[01:16:31.683 --> 01:16:35.424]  I remember when I was in prison and you tried to come down to see me and
[01:16:36.594 --> 01:16:46.293]  And make sure that I was okay, and it was one of my dreams to sit here with you in the studio, and here I am today, and I'm just blown away, man, and thanks for...
[01:16:48.206 --> 01:16:49.207]  Thank you for still having me here.
[01:16:49.207 --> 01:16:57.675]  Oh, it's awesome to have you, and you're speaking to college students all over the country, you're speaking to the Black Congressional Congress Press Club, you're at the premiere with Renner of the film.
[01:16:57.675 --> 01:17:06.723]  I mean, you're having a big effect now, and that is so exciting that you can really educate people because back when this all first came out, people didn't believe the CIA was bringing drugs in.
[01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:07.304]  I didn't believe it.
[01:17:08.146 --> 01:17:14.931]  I mean, I'm going to be honest with you, even when Gary reported the story and I was like, this guy Gary, what is he talking about?
[01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:19.054]  I was involved with the CIA and no way.
[01:17:19.054 --> 01:17:26.759]  It wasn't until the CIA themselves told me that they were involved and put out their report.
[01:17:26.759 --> 01:17:27.960]  I mean, that was when I really
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:31.721]  When it really hit me that, hey, Gary was right.
[01:17:31.721 --> 01:17:34.082]  You know, because, I mean, it was just hard for me to believe.
[01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:40.324]  How can a little guy like me, who wasn't supposed to succeed, couldn't read, couldn't write, high school dropout.
[01:17:40.324 --> 01:17:45.105]  I mean, how could I, you know, be involved with something this big?
[01:17:45.105 --> 01:17:48.286]  I mean, it was just like totally shocking to me.
[01:17:48.286 --> 01:17:50.207]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:51.407]  Let's start at the beginning.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:18:08.237]  And in the few minutes we have before break, start at the beginning of your life, your life, get into how you got into drug dealing, how you suddenly found this incredible source that made you the biggest dealer on the West Coast, and then we'll lead right through your trial, prison, the drug war, and phone calls.
[01:18:08.237 --> 01:18:09.078]  All right, let's do that.
[01:18:09.078 --> 01:18:11.080]  Well, you know, I was born here in Texas.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.062]  Tyler, my mom,
[01:18:14.409 --> 01:18:14.710]  This is
[01:18:29.548 --> 01:18:33.652]  I got to see the Black Panthers and, you know, I used to want to be a Panther.
[01:18:33.652 --> 01:18:42.619]  So I go to school and, you know, trying to be like any other normal kid, you know, want to be a police officer, a firefighter, an airplane pilot.
[01:18:42.619 --> 01:18:50.106]  Started playing tennis in high school, you know, did pretty good, made All-City, was offered scholarships, but I couldn't read or write.
[01:18:50.106 --> 01:18:53.529]  So when it was time to take the scholarships, I couldn't, I couldn't go to college.
[01:18:54.437 --> 01:19:02.542]  So I found myself with the one thing that I thought that I could count on was my tennis to get me out the ghetto.
[01:19:02.542 --> 01:19:06.705]  And I found that that was no longer an option for me.
[01:19:06.705 --> 01:19:10.888]  So I found myself back in the streets in South Central Los Angeles.
[01:19:10.888 --> 01:19:16.552]  So I'm walking around trying to figure out, you know, what was I going to do with myself and couldn't get a job.
[01:19:17.205 --> 01:19:23.231]  You know, even though I was a very hard worker, had no problem, you know, rolling up my sleeves and doing whatever.
[01:19:23.231 --> 01:19:28.917]  Car washing, taking out trash, any number of things.
[01:19:28.917 --> 01:19:33.101]  Just anything that I could do to start making a living, I was willing to do it.
[01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:39.188]  Well, one of my friends came from college and he had this stuff called cocaine.

[01:19:47.308 --> 01:19:48.768]  The Untold Autobiography.
[01:19:48.768 --> 01:19:55.811]  You're getting the big exclusive inside the CIA drug dealing operations of the crack cocaine epidemic.
[01:19:55.811 --> 01:19:56.432]  Straight ahead.
[01:19:56.432 --> 01:19:57.092]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:20:19.762 --> 01:20:25.325]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[01:20:25.325 --> 01:20:28.967]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.

[01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:34.272]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[01:20:34.272 --> 01:20:38.556]  Civil unrest, riots, looting, it's happening now, right here in the United States.
[01:20:38.556 --> 01:20:40.158]  And your rights are at risk.
[01:20:40.158 --> 01:20:44.182]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.

[01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:35.714]  This winter, next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[01:23:35.714 --> 01:23:37.655]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[01:23:37.655 --> 01:23:45.960]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel can be safely stored with your other supplies for many years and works in any gas-powered vehicle or backup generator.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:51.663]  With the bitterly cold temperatures predicted for this winter, now is the best time to stock up on spare fuel.

[01:24:03.232 --> 01:24:25.948]  The real Rick Ross, Freeway Rick Ross, became the biggest cocaine dealer on the West Coast on record.
[01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:36.954]  It became the heart of an investigation that later the CIA Inspector General had to admit that the CIA was involved in bringing in the majority of the cocaine, at least on the West Coast.
[01:24:36.954 --> 01:24:38.054]  It's much bigger than that.
[01:24:38.054 --> 01:24:39.295]  Mino, Arkansas.
[01:24:39.295 --> 01:24:42.456]  I've interviewed the pilots that were there unloading the cocaine.
[01:24:42.456 --> 01:24:51.340]  Not just Tosh Plumlee, who's on record Iran-Contra testimony, but just so many others that were there and saw
[01:24:52.609 --> 01:24:59.236]  Saw governors, saw vice presidents, who would be there personally offloading aircraft with the cocaine.
[01:24:59.236 --> 01:25:01.818]  I mean, if local kids saw it, they'd kill them.
[01:25:01.818 --> 01:25:05.742]  Remember Mina, Arkansas and all that?
[01:25:05.742 --> 01:25:07.865]  And then if cops talked about that, they'd kill the cops.
[01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:11.674]  I mean, a lot of people have died over this information.
[01:25:11.674 --> 01:25:13.457]  I hope you understand this.
[01:25:13.457 --> 01:25:15.480]  And everybody today is like, yeah, we know they bring it in.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:16.321]  Well, wait.
[01:25:16.321 --> 01:25:18.825]  We didn't know this back in the 90s.
[01:25:18.825 --> 01:25:23.552]  There'd been the heroin coming in out of Southeast Asia, but they'd blame a colonel or somebody.
[01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:24.553]  This is organized.
[01:25:25.174 --> 01:25:25.994]  This is a short segment.
[01:25:25.994 --> 01:25:28.095]  I want to go back to you, Rick Ross.
[01:25:28.095 --> 01:25:29.516]  It's great to have you here, my friend.
[01:25:29.516 --> 01:25:34.798]  I appreciate your courage and you not selling out and getting that longer sentence for not backing down.
[01:25:34.798 --> 01:25:38.219]  But let's get into now where you left off.
[01:25:38.219 --> 01:25:41.240]  You can't get a job that pays well.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.261]  You don't have a criminal record.
[01:25:43.261 --> 01:25:46.182]  You could have got a scholarship, but you couldn't read and write for tennis.
[01:25:46.182 --> 01:25:47.663]  And then your friend comes back from college.
[01:25:48.263 --> 01:25:52.484]  Yeah, so he introduces me to cocaine for the first time.
[01:25:52.484 --> 01:25:56.445]  But what I also noticed, Alex, you know, when I was in prison, I did a lot of thinking back.
[01:25:56.445 --> 01:26:09.087]  And I can remember when, before I started selling cocaine, you know, they started coming out with movies like Superfly and almost like priming you up for this lifestyle that you're about to get into.
[01:26:09.087 --> 01:26:11.448]  So when my friend comes and shows me cocaine, I'm interested.
[01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:13.431]  Because I saw Superfly.
[01:26:13.431 --> 01:26:14.291]  What you hit is key.
[01:26:14.291 --> 01:26:16.252]  The CIA has now declassified that.
[01:26:16.252 --> 01:26:21.675]  Rock and roll, the drug culture, the CIA delivered the first suitcases of LSD.
[01:26:21.675 --> 01:26:23.415]  White kids weren't smoking marijuana.
[01:26:23.415 --> 01:26:24.436]  They delivered it.
[01:26:24.436 --> 01:26:25.236]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:26:25.236 --> 01:26:26.497]  They primed the whole deal.
[01:26:26.497 --> 01:26:27.297]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:27.297 --> 01:26:34.121]  It's almost like they get your mind ready so that when you get the opportunity that you're interested in... It's called predictive programming.
[01:26:34.121 --> 01:26:35.741]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:26:35.741 --> 01:26:37.062]  It's just what you're saying is absolutely right.
[01:26:37.062 --> 01:26:40.464]  So, when my friend comes and he shows me this stuff, I've never seen it before.
[01:26:41.226 --> 01:26:42.387]  It was yellowish.
[01:26:42.387 --> 01:26:43.067]  Yellowish white.
[01:26:43.067 --> 01:26:46.448]  And I'm like, well I thought cocaine was supposed to be white.
[01:26:46.448 --> 01:26:47.929]  He's like, no man, this is it.
[01:26:47.929 --> 01:26:49.049]  So he introduces it to me.
[01:26:49.049 --> 01:26:51.410]  He gives me a little bit, like $50 worth.
[01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:53.191]  He said, go and see what you can do with it.
[01:26:53.191 --> 01:26:55.152]  So I go around the neighborhood and I'm asking everybody.
[01:26:55.152 --> 01:26:56.552]  Nobody knows what it is.
[01:26:56.552 --> 01:26:58.853]  I mean, I'm going all over South Central LA.
[01:26:58.853 --> 01:27:00.034]  Finally, I run into a guy.
[01:27:00.034 --> 01:27:01.154]  He was a pimp.
[01:27:01.154 --> 01:27:02.175]  And he says, let me see it.
[01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:06.957]  And he takes it and he cooks it up and he says, oh yeah, it's pretty good stuff.
[01:27:07.785 --> 01:27:09.766]  And that's how I got started selling cocaine.
[01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:20.631]  And it went from there to this one person would buy from me and then another one would come and he would introduce me to somebody else until up, you know, some days I'm making three million dollars a day.
[01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:22.752]  So you got in on the ground floor of it?
[01:27:22.752 --> 01:27:23.773]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:23.773 --> 01:27:25.674]  Totally ground.
[01:27:25.674 --> 01:27:27.054]  Was totally a novice.
[01:27:27.054 --> 01:27:28.595]  I had never smoked pot.
[01:27:28.595 --> 01:27:34.298]  At that time I was still tinkering on being a tennis player, you know, like, I don't know if you're gonna make it in tennis, you know.
[01:27:35.509 --> 01:27:36.330]  But you gotta do something.
[01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:38.772]  You know, my mom's on my back right now because I'm living with my mom.
[01:27:38.772 --> 01:27:40.773]  I'm not bringing in any income.
[01:27:40.773 --> 01:27:42.455]  And she's really going hard on me.
[01:27:42.455 --> 01:27:43.235]  You know, you're a bum.
[01:27:43.235 --> 01:27:46.818]  You're not going to be doing nothing with your life.
[01:27:46.818 --> 01:27:48.940]  So I desperately want to do something now.
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:50.701]  I need to make some money somewhere.
[01:27:50.701 --> 01:27:54.824]  So when this opportunity came, you know, I thought that it was a blessing from God.
[01:27:54.824 --> 01:27:57.606]  You know, I started off just helping Mike, who was my friend.
[01:27:57.606 --> 01:28:00.569]  You know, I'd make the money for him, give him all the money.
[01:28:00.569 --> 01:28:01.870]  And pretty soon I know the business.
[01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:11.384]  It goes from there, from making $50 a week to, you know, like I said, $3 million a day sometimes.
[01:28:11.384 --> 01:28:16.988]  In fact, I was reading sometimes you were bringing in $30 million a deal every few days.
[01:28:16.988 --> 01:28:17.789]  Well, yeah.
[01:28:17.789 --> 01:28:25.054]  I mean, if you add up 10 days, you know, you do 10 days worth of dealing, you know, you're talking about $10 million or more.
[01:28:25.054 --> 01:28:26.355]  No, like $30 million.
[01:28:26.355 --> 01:28:27.215]  And this is 1980s money?
[01:28:27.215 --> 01:28:28.116]  Yeah, 1980s money.
[01:28:28.116 --> 01:28:28.256]  84ish, 85, 86.
[01:28:34.474 --> 01:28:37.277]  So you were there when folks didn't even know what cocaine was?
[01:28:37.277 --> 01:28:40.761]  In my community, nobody, nobody knew what cocaine was.
[01:28:40.761 --> 01:28:42.744]  Yeah, it was a rich white guy drug.
[01:28:42.744 --> 01:28:43.585]  Well, that's how I felt.
[01:28:43.585 --> 01:28:48.010]  You know, I felt that when I first started selling cocaine, I felt that it was another
[01:28:49.428 --> 01:28:50.869]  Because I've been discriminated against.
[01:28:50.869 --> 01:28:57.192]  You know, I've been to a hospital and they said, oh no, you can't sit right there because this is a white only section.
[01:28:57.192 --> 01:28:58.153]  You have to go to the back.
[01:28:58.153 --> 01:29:00.754]  So when I started selling cocaine, that's how I felt about cocaine.
[01:29:00.754 --> 01:29:04.996]  That it was another one of those things that they said, no, this is for white people and you guys can't have it.
[01:29:04.996 --> 01:29:09.178]  So I felt like I was bringing cocaine to my community to give us something.
[01:29:09.178 --> 01:29:11.339]  But the CIA said, oh, you blacks want it?
[01:29:11.339 --> 01:29:12.880]  We're going to make something special for you.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.381]  Here's how you make crack.
[01:29:14.381 --> 01:29:17.223]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:17.223 --> 01:29:17.503]  Totally.
[01:29:18.277 --> 01:29:21.126]  Makes it hit harder, be more addictive, turn people into zombies.
[01:29:21.126 --> 01:29:24.396]  Yeah, I mean that's what happened.
[01:29:24.396 --> 01:29:25.279]  Exactly how it turned out.
[01:29:26.471 --> 01:29:27.312]  Unbelievable.
[01:29:27.312 --> 01:29:28.473]  We're going to break it all down.
[01:29:28.473 --> 01:29:29.694]  18-minute segment coming up.
[01:29:29.694 --> 01:29:30.815]  You're going to get the floor.
[01:29:30.815 --> 01:29:32.116]  Get ready to roll.
[01:29:32.116 --> 01:29:33.378]  Just go through it all.
[01:29:33.378 --> 01:29:34.919]  Rick Ross is our guest.
[01:29:34.919 --> 01:29:38.923]  Ground level of the CIA crack cocaine epidemic.
[01:29:38.923 --> 01:29:42.186]  And then all of a sudden, years after he's out of it, they want to get rid of all the loose ends.
[01:29:42.186 --> 01:29:44.187]  They're trying to throw him in jail.
[01:29:44.187 --> 01:29:47.270]  Turns out all the people involved, they all knew what was going on.
[01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:48.852]  The CIA came to visit him.
[01:29:48.852 --> 01:29:49.753]  Said, shut your mouth.
[01:29:50.498 --> 01:29:54.428]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.428 --> 01:29:57.114]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.451 --> 01:30:11.098]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[01:30:11.098 --> 01:30:21.025]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:21.025 --> 01:30:23.947]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:24.087 --> 01:30:24.347]  I think so.
[01:30:39.104 --> 01:30:39.384]  We're good.
[01:31:01.499 --> 01:31:05.161]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:05.161 --> 01:31:09.444]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:09.444 --> 01:31:11.225]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:11.225 --> 01:31:16.548]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:31:16.548 --> 01:31:19.089]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:31:19.089 --> 01:31:20.230]  But for how long?
[01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:22.431]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:31:22.431 --> 01:31:26.854]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:31:26.854 --> 01:31:29.676]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:31:31.107 --> 01:31:41.671]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:31:41.671 --> 01:31:48.133]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:31:48.133 --> 01:31:50.474]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:31:50.474 --> 01:31:53.575]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:31:53.575 --> 01:32:00.437]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:32:00.857 --> 01:32:07.259]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[01:32:07.259 --> 01:32:08.240]  It has changed my life.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.420]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.921]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.
[01:32:11.921 --> 01:32:14.462]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:15.742]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[01:32:15.922 --> 01:32:19.928]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[01:32:19.928 --> 01:32:21.910]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:24.674]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:32:24.674 --> 01:32:30.802]  Whether it's survival shield, nascent iodine, or DNA force, super meal vitality, super female vitality,
[01:32:30.942 --> 01:32:34.403]  Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder.
[01:32:34.403 --> 01:32:42.606]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:42.606 --> 01:32:44.346]  There's two.
[01:32:44.346 --> 01:32:48.207]  Just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[01:32:48.207 --> 01:32:49.008]  It's great stuff.
[01:32:49.008 --> 01:32:53.049]  If I'm going to promote something, it's got to be something I personally use and that I believe in.
[01:32:53.049 --> 01:32:59.791]  Check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[01:33:03.322 --> 01:33:08.425]  I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own.
[01:33:08.425 --> 01:33:24.735]  I've also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.
[01:33:24.735 --> 01:33:29.678]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.967 --> 01:33:37.588]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:37.588 --> 01:33:41.571]  We've got Rick Ross with us for the entire third hour coming up.
[01:33:41.571 --> 01:33:47.335]  About 20 minutes into that hour, I'm going to open the phones up for your questions for Freeway Rick Ross.
[01:33:47.335 --> 01:33:48.476]  And he is here with us.
[01:33:48.476 --> 01:33:53.359]  We are selling his amazing untold story autobiography.
[01:33:53.359 --> 01:33:54.480]  It is available.
[01:33:55.672 --> 01:34:01.018]  At InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:34:01.018 --> 01:34:05.323]  And you need to give this to young people, you know.
[01:34:05.323 --> 01:34:08.046]  You need to give this to police officers, you know.
[01:34:08.046 --> 01:34:10.128]  You need to give this to preachers, you know.
[01:34:10.128 --> 01:34:12.831]  It is so immoral and hypocritical.
[01:34:12.831 --> 01:34:16.455]  If the preacher gets up in the pulpit and gives an anti-drug sermon, which I think they should,
[01:34:17.948 --> 01:34:22.490]  Drugs, whether they're prescription or illicit, are just super destructive.
[01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.931]  Everybody knows that.
[01:34:23.931 --> 01:34:26.332]  I mean, sure, some opiate pills are fine if your leg's broken.
[01:34:26.332 --> 01:34:29.694]  You had surgery, but it just wrecks people's lives.
[01:34:29.694 --> 01:34:40.298]  They are making this stuff illegal so they can make money in the black market, no pun intended, and then still puts you in prison.
[01:34:40.298 --> 01:34:43.140]  This is a social engineering plan.
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:43.420]  Also,
[01:34:44.423 --> 01:34:47.765]  It's part of the social engineering with the GMO and the additives in the food and water.
[01:34:47.765 --> 01:34:50.087]  They don't want you getting all natural healthy things.
[01:34:50.087 --> 01:35:02.254]  They don't want you knowing that they've taken the good halogen iodine out of the salt and food and bread and put the bad halogens of bromine, bromide and fluoride in to just fry your glands.
[01:35:02.254 --> 01:35:05.937]  They don't want you to know about Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[01:35:05.937 --> 01:35:08.518]  We're the only company that has the deep earth crystal source.
[01:35:08.518 --> 01:35:10.760]  All the rest is a seaweed source, which is still great.
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:14.644]  Sea salt's great if it's all you can get, or the seaweed-based stuff.
[01:35:14.644 --> 01:35:16.527]  That's what I first got on and changed my life.
[01:35:16.527 --> 01:35:18.269]  Helped me lose a bunch of weight and get healthier.
[01:35:18.269 --> 01:35:19.931]  But man, when I got on the Crystal Source X2...
[01:35:22.011 --> 01:35:28.954]  Group have been trying to get a source of this for years, Dr. Groob, and then finally a couple years ago had it and took him years to get it together.
[01:35:28.954 --> 01:35:34.676]  And, I mean, you've got to jump through DEA hoops, you name it, to get iodine because it's a very powerful substance.
[01:35:34.676 --> 01:35:36.837]  The type we use is the crystal source.
[01:35:36.837 --> 01:35:38.598]  It turns into purple gas.
[01:35:38.598 --> 01:35:40.999]  If you put it on a hot plate, we have video of it.
[01:35:40.999 --> 01:35:44.600]  I mean, it's that pure.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:45.501]  200 million year old.
[01:35:46.647 --> 01:35:48.208]  Unbelievable what it does in your body.
[01:35:48.208 --> 01:35:50.649]  Just get ready for all the oil to come out all the time.
[01:35:50.649 --> 01:35:53.490]  Just what is covering my family has been sensational.
[01:35:53.490 --> 01:35:57.613]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:57.613 --> 01:36:01.715]  I got some good news and some bad news.
[01:36:01.715 --> 01:36:04.216]  It is going to sell out by the end of the week.
[01:36:04.216 --> 01:36:07.678]  The good news is it may only take three weeks to get more in.
[01:36:07.678 --> 01:36:14.521]  So if you want Survival Shield X2 discounted 10%, we're just keeping that discount till it sells out when you get it with the lung cleanse.
[01:36:14.521 --> 01:36:15.882]  It's part of the biodefense pack.
[01:36:17.475 --> 01:36:18.235]  10% off.
[01:36:18.235 --> 01:36:24.781]  You can also use the promo code NOW and get 5% off all the other products that are already discounted.
[01:36:24.781 --> 01:36:30.086]  DNA Force, Oxy Powder, already the lowest price on Oxy Powder, but 5% off promo code now.
[01:36:30.086 --> 01:36:32.408]  Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[01:36:32.408 --> 01:36:37.352]  And again, this doesn't mimic testosterone, the concentrated organic herbs that are in there.
[01:36:37.352 --> 01:36:41.015]  It's stuff that's been developed to get your body to release what you're already supposed to have.
[01:36:41.656 --> 01:36:46.420]  With all the chemicals and the estrogen mimickers that are really screwing men up particularly.
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:49.362]  Then the formulations for women to help get them cleaned up.
[01:36:49.362 --> 01:36:50.763]  And you've heard the rave reviews.
[01:36:50.763 --> 01:36:52.344]  We are self-funding here.
[01:36:52.344 --> 01:36:56.487]  I fund this whole operation off books, videos, t-shirts, sponsors.
[01:36:56.487 --> 01:36:58.628]  We're not like NPR getting public money.
[01:36:58.628 --> 01:37:01.230]  We're not like MSNBC getting stimulus money.
[01:37:01.230 --> 01:37:03.932]  Our parent company is some weapons manufacturer.
[01:37:03.932 --> 01:37:08.296]  This is an operation set up by me, Alex Jones, to try to promote the truth.
[01:37:08.976 --> 01:37:11.218]  Because the truth will set us free as Christ said.
[01:37:11.218 --> 01:37:13.260]  So Freeway Rick Ross is our guest.
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.320]  FreewayRick.com.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.102]  You can get his book there as well.
[01:37:16.102 --> 01:37:19.024]  Or at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:19.024 --> 01:37:24.509]  Find the supplements at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:24.509 --> 01:37:26.370]  Or again, the book at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:26.370 --> 01:37:27.811]  And please remember to support our local A.M.
[01:37:27.811 --> 01:37:28.111]  and F.M.
[01:37:28.111 --> 01:37:29.593]  affiliates.
[01:37:29.593 --> 01:37:32.935]  Whether it's Oklahoma City or... I haven't plugged some of these new affiliates.
[01:37:32.935 --> 01:37:36.558]  We've got a new one in Chicago on top of our other affiliate.
[01:37:36.558 --> 01:37:37.559]  And we've also got...
[01:37:39.252 --> 01:37:40.913]  Jasper, Texas just turned us on.
[01:37:40.913 --> 01:37:44.193]  It's like five or six new affiliates the last two weeks and I haven't plugged them.
[01:37:44.193 --> 01:37:45.214]  They've told me to plug them.
[01:37:45.214 --> 01:37:51.296]  If you print those out again, I'll actually mention those on air, but please tell friends and family about the show if you're listening to it.
[01:37:51.296 --> 01:37:54.657]  It's a big deal that a show telling the truth like this can be heard.
[01:37:54.657 --> 01:37:55.557]  It's all word of mouth.
[01:37:56.357 --> 01:37:58.298]  Please support their local sponsors.
[01:37:58.298 --> 01:38:01.599]  Please tell them why you're supporting the sponsors, or become a sponsor.
[01:38:01.599 --> 01:38:11.082]  If you're a car dealership, or a restaurant, or a bookstore, or a maid service, or a hotel, whatever, you better support it.
[01:38:11.082 --> 01:38:18.024]  That's why we've gone from being on the weekends, to weeknights, to prime time, on almost every affiliate that picks up our show.
[01:38:18.024 --> 01:38:21.945]  It's because you have been supporting it, so you're the reason we're reaching more people.
[01:38:21.945 --> 01:38:23.746]  Now, Rick Ross, you've got the floor.
[01:38:24.915 --> 01:38:26.578]  You've told the story.
[01:38:26.578 --> 01:38:28.661]  Biggest cocaine dealer in West Coast history.
[01:38:28.661 --> 01:38:29.702]  When it came out in your trial...
[01:38:31.155 --> 01:38:38.538]  That the prosecution knew, the government knew, the DEA knew, the CIA knew, that you were one of their main distributors, but you didn't even know.
[01:38:38.538 --> 01:38:45.021]  I want to get into that relationship and more, but you've gotten to the point in a few years to where, you know, tell the story.
[01:38:45.021 --> 01:38:46.281]  Did you ever use?
[01:38:46.281 --> 01:38:48.062]  Why were you so successful?
[01:38:48.062 --> 01:38:55.305]  And then go ahead and walk through everything that happened, and then now what your message is to the youth about what's really going on, and we'll talk about Gary Webb.
[01:38:55.305 --> 01:38:57.946]  Well, I did start using for a short time.
[01:38:57.946 --> 01:38:59.847]  You know, I got up to a point to where
[01:39:01.241 --> 01:39:03.241]  I probably had about eight or nine thousand dollars.
[01:39:03.241 --> 01:39:05.302]  I thought I was rich.
[01:39:05.302 --> 01:39:10.783]  So, you know, when you're rich, you start experimenting, you know, with the drugs.
[01:39:10.783 --> 01:39:13.723]  And I looked up, all my money was gone.
[01:39:13.723 --> 01:39:15.423]  So I immediately quit using.
[01:39:15.423 --> 01:39:17.484]  You know, I went back and regrouped.
[01:39:17.484 --> 01:39:18.544]  You know, I learned that from tennis.
[01:39:18.544 --> 01:39:22.205]  When you're doing something wrong, you go back and you figure out what you're doing wrong.
[01:39:22.205 --> 01:39:24.485]  So I figured out that I couldn't use anymore.
[01:39:24.485 --> 01:39:26.205]  If I wanted to be rich, I had to stop using.
[01:39:26.205 --> 01:39:29.646]  So I stopped using and I went on to get rich.
[01:39:29.646 --> 01:39:29.846]  Well,
[01:39:30.754 --> 01:39:32.275]  I made a lot of money.
[01:39:32.275 --> 01:39:34.777]  You know, like I said, I made three million dollars a day sometimes.
[01:39:34.777 --> 01:39:40.222]  And then it got to the point to where I started seeing the effects that cocaine was having inside of my community.
[01:39:40.222 --> 01:39:44.526]  And it wasn't the effects that I initially thought that it was going to have.
[01:39:44.526 --> 01:39:46.627]  You know, I started seeing people pushing baskets.
[01:39:46.627 --> 01:39:51.412]  I started seeing women walking the streets and women doing anything to get high.
[01:39:51.412 --> 01:39:54.494]  And I started to rethink my position.
[01:39:54.494 --> 01:39:55.115]  That was around
[01:39:58.012 --> 01:39:59.532]  88, 89.
[01:39:59.532 --> 01:40:00.893]  At that time, I threw my hands up.
[01:40:00.893 --> 01:40:01.553]  I said, you know what?
[01:40:01.553 --> 01:40:02.874]  I'm through with the cocaine business.
[01:40:02.874 --> 01:40:03.634]  I got enough money.
[01:40:03.634 --> 01:40:06.275]  I got more money now than I ever thought that I would have in my life.
[01:40:06.275 --> 01:40:07.815]  I got businesses.
[01:40:07.815 --> 01:40:10.156]  So I walked away.
[01:40:10.156 --> 01:40:15.278]  Well, what happened is the government came back and indicted me for the things that I'd already done.
[01:40:15.278 --> 01:40:16.899]  Went to prison.
[01:40:16.899 --> 01:40:19.740]  Did five years in prison.
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.101]  I got out.
[01:40:22.101 --> 01:40:24.922]  Immediately after I got out, they had Danilo Blandon started to call me.
[01:40:25.971 --> 01:40:29.153]  And his goal was to get me back inside of drugs, but I didn't want to go back.
[01:40:29.153 --> 01:40:31.214]  I was trying to go straight.
[01:40:31.214 --> 01:40:35.676]  He hounded me for like six months to introduce him to one of my friends.
[01:40:35.676 --> 01:40:52.986]  Once I made the introduction, my friend handed him a bag of money, and the cops swooped in, arrested all of us, and they got me for brokering the deal, for making the introduction, saying that I knew that they were going to be doing a drug deal, and for that reason that I aided and abetted the crime.
[01:40:54.127 --> 01:40:56.489]  For doing that crime, they gave me a life sentence.
[01:40:56.489 --> 01:41:03.793]  While I was sitting in jail doing this life sentence, fighting my case, I was approached by a reporter, Gary Webb.
[01:41:04.713 --> 01:41:06.275]  Well, Gary came down and he saw me.
[01:41:06.275 --> 01:41:10.379]  He started talking about that I was in something bigger than, you know, what I thought I was.
[01:41:10.379 --> 01:41:13.643]  But you know also too, Alex, that there were some cops on my case.
[01:41:13.643 --> 01:41:16.546]  They called themselves the Freeway Task Force.
[01:41:16.546 --> 01:41:23.073]  And those cops were robbing and stealing and, you know, they let the dog bite me while I was handcuffed.
[01:41:23.073 --> 01:41:24.134]  They got indicted as well.
[01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:30.250]  So, I meet Gary Webb and he's like, oh man, this is bigger than what you think it is.
[01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:32.011]  I'm thinking that they're talking about the crooked cops.
[01:41:32.011 --> 01:41:38.975]  You know, it's like 35, 40 cops that's running around robbing drug dealers, taking their money, and they became drug dealers themselves.
[01:41:38.975 --> 01:41:39.395]  Really.
[01:41:39.395 --> 01:41:41.176]  Because they was taking the drugs from one person
[01:41:42.085 --> 01:41:47.848]  Planting them on another person and selling them to this person and just you know just criminal enterprise.
[01:41:47.848 --> 01:42:03.716]  I mean the whole the whole war on drugs is just like one big hopes of one person benefiting this one another one benefiting that way but at the end of the day guys like myself get caught in the middle and and I believe that we're the ones who's paying the biggest price.
[01:42:03.716 --> 01:42:05.237]  Not necessarily myself because
[01:42:07.162 --> 01:42:09.924]  When I was in prison, I couldn't cry about my time.
[01:42:09.924 --> 01:42:14.607]  You know, if they'd have gave me the life sentence, I'd have had to do the rest of my life in prison.
[01:42:14.607 --> 01:42:15.908]  I could have accepted that because...
[01:42:17.885 --> 01:42:19.486]  I knew that what I was doing.
[01:42:19.486 --> 01:42:24.328]  You know, I knew I was selling drugs, and I knew that I shouldn't have been selling drugs after a period of time.
[01:42:24.328 --> 01:42:31.431]  You know, that's the key to integrity and sanity, I've learned, is admitting when you've been wrong, admitting and owning up to it.
[01:42:31.431 --> 01:42:36.513]  But then there's the giant hypocrisy, they're the ones bringing the drugs in, and they're the ones putting you in jail.
[01:42:36.513 --> 01:42:40.374]  That's a thousand times worse, and they never own up to any of it.
[01:42:40.374 --> 01:42:43.696]  In fact, they sit up there like they're God, and they're clean, and they're good.
[01:42:43.696 --> 01:42:45.136]  That makes you want to throw up.
[01:42:45.136 --> 01:42:46.497]  Well, you know, that's what really, really...
[01:42:47.458 --> 01:42:50.261]  It started to affect me, you know, when I was in prison and I'm like...
[01:42:51.258 --> 01:42:56.521]  Once everything came out and I interviewed with the CIA, you know the CIA came down to my jail cell.
[01:42:56.521 --> 01:43:00.864]  Let's talk about that, but let's also go back to your trial when you learn about all this with Gary Webb.
[01:43:00.864 --> 01:43:05.687]  Tell that story, because Webb talked about how he got threatened out in the hall, threatened to kill him and stuff.
[01:43:05.687 --> 01:43:07.528]  They didn't just threaten to kill his kids.
[01:43:07.528 --> 01:43:12.931]  I mean, the feds themselves that were there, not just the CIA, they were basically all in on it.
[01:43:12.931 --> 01:43:16.013]  The VA, I mean, they sent back this new trial.
[01:43:16.013 --> 01:43:16.913]  We're going to trial.
[01:43:19.673 --> 01:43:25.479]  There's a period in court where you get to interview the informant because we never talk to the informant.
[01:43:25.479 --> 01:43:27.380]  We don't know what the informant is going to say.
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:31.224]  You have no clue about what the person who's going to testify against you is going to say.
[01:43:31.224 --> 01:43:39.632]  So the court has a thing where they call a pre-trial hearing where the informant is supposed to come to like a little room.
[01:43:39.632 --> 01:43:42.555]  I couldn't be there but my lawyer was supposed to be there and Gary was supposed to be there.
[01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:52.359]  Well anyway, Blandon comes to this hearing, and when they get in the room and my lawyer wants to ask him some questions, and the guy said, everything that I gotta say, I'm gonna say during trial.
[01:43:52.359 --> 01:43:54.321]  So, we don't know what this guy is gonna say.
[01:43:55.546 --> 01:43:57.868]  So we start- You're unable to ever do a deposition?
[01:43:57.868 --> 01:43:59.590]  No deposition with this guy.
[01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:03.994]  So, when we get to trial, my lawyer don't have a clue what's going on.
[01:44:03.994 --> 01:44:07.177]  All the information that Gary has, we don't have this information.
[01:44:07.177 --> 01:44:08.959]  And Gary's not giving it to us.
[01:44:08.959 --> 01:44:12.021]  He didn't give us this information at first.
[01:44:12.021 --> 01:44:14.183]  Because Gary knew I had the relationship with LA Times.
[01:44:15.103 --> 01:44:24.986]  So I felt that Gary was worried about me leaking his information to Jesse Katz at LA Times, because you know me and Jesse Katz still had a relationship where we talked once in a while.
[01:44:24.986 --> 01:44:26.706]  So Gary didn't give it to us.
[01:44:26.706 --> 01:44:33.388]  We start trial, and in the middle of trial, my lawyer keeps running back and forth to Gary.
[01:44:33.388 --> 01:44:35.048]  Gary's in the audience.
[01:44:35.048 --> 01:44:36.369]  So he's at the trial.
[01:44:37.432 --> 01:44:37.832]  Exactly.
[01:44:37.832 --> 01:44:39.872]  I mean, he had to do it like that almost.
[01:44:39.872 --> 01:44:41.653]  Because I may have given it to Jesse, not knowing
[01:45:05.777 --> 01:45:07.458]  You know, because I didn't know the scope of this.
[01:45:07.458 --> 01:45:09.058]  Believe me, I had no idea.
[01:45:09.058 --> 01:45:13.300]  You know, they tried to say that I told Gary how to put it together.
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.300]  You know they said that, right?
[01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:14.821]  Yes.
[01:45:14.821 --> 01:45:15.261]  They did.
[01:45:15.261 --> 01:45:19.702]  Oh, Rick Ross dreamed this all up and put this together and fed it to Gary and got Gary to buy into it.
[01:45:19.702 --> 01:45:21.163]  But I didn't know none of this.
[01:45:21.163 --> 01:45:23.644]  They gave me more credit than I deserve.
[01:45:23.644 --> 01:45:26.085]  Who would have thought the LA Times, you know, was involved, yeah.
[01:45:28.052 --> 01:45:28.792]  That's how it works, though.
[01:45:28.792 --> 01:45:32.453]  You're going to take down a culture and bring in and make trillions off drugs.
[01:45:32.453 --> 01:45:33.734]  You've got to run the newspapers.
[01:45:33.734 --> 01:45:34.554]  Yeah, you have to.
[01:45:34.554 --> 01:45:35.254]  You have to.
[01:45:35.254 --> 01:45:36.394]  And that's what's so amazing.
[01:45:36.394 --> 01:45:40.655]  Even right now, today, you know, it baffles me that people don't know this.
[01:45:40.655 --> 01:45:42.356]  I'm like, the CIA admitted it.
[01:45:42.356 --> 01:45:43.456]  They got a report.
[01:45:43.456 --> 01:45:47.057]  You can go to their website and the report is on their website and people don't know it.
[01:45:47.057 --> 01:45:49.198]  Father Inspector General, please continue.
[01:45:50.973 --> 01:45:58.236]  We in court, and Gary's asking my lawyer this, and then the judge recognized what's going on, and she was like, well, why do you keep talking to this reporter?
[01:45:58.236 --> 01:46:01.418]  Why are you running back and forth to him in the courtroom?
[01:46:01.418 --> 01:46:03.179]  I want you to stand here and do this.
[01:46:03.179 --> 01:46:16.185]  We're not on a fishing exposition, because, you know, Gary was asking about certain names, Enrique Ramirez, and then Blandon talks about, well, my boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush, and when they come back, they say the ends justify the means.
[01:46:18.795 --> 01:46:20.756]  All this type of stuff, but this stuff is still not making sense.
[01:46:20.756 --> 01:46:22.318]  It's all Machiavelli, yeah.
[01:46:22.318 --> 01:46:23.618]  To me, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:46:23.618 --> 01:46:25.119]  You know, I don't know.
[01:46:25.119 --> 01:46:29.122]  I mean, I'm learning about the court system while I'm there, but, you know, I'm not a lawyer.
[01:46:29.122 --> 01:46:32.365]  I'm still a novice.
[01:46:32.365 --> 01:46:34.426]  You know, this is a guy that couldn't read.
[01:46:34.426 --> 01:46:36.728]  You know, two years ago, I couldn't read.
[01:46:36.728 --> 01:46:40.510]  So, I'm still learning what's going on.
[01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:42.111]  So then, eventually, we finish trial.
[01:46:42.111 --> 01:46:43.752]  They give me the life sentence.
[01:46:43.752 --> 01:46:47.095]  And a couple months later, Gary's story come out.
[01:46:47.788 --> 01:46:48.888]  Gary sends me a copy.
[01:46:48.888 --> 01:46:51.649]  I get a copy the day before it comes out.
[01:46:51.649 --> 01:46:57.470]  I call Gary on the phone and then we start to talk and he starts to tell me, you know, about the CIA being involved, about the Contras.
[01:46:57.470 --> 01:47:00.290]  Because, you know, I really didn't know what the Contras was.
[01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:01.871]  I had no clue what the Contras was.
[01:47:01.871 --> 01:47:08.012]  Definitely did not know that they were backed by the CIA and Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
[01:47:08.012 --> 01:47:10.132]  Had no clue that they was backed by that.
[01:47:10.132 --> 01:47:14.613]  I did know that Danilo and these guys and all of his friends were fighting a war in their country.
[01:47:15.653 --> 01:47:17.615]  Uh, didn't know what the war was over.
[01:47:17.615 --> 01:47:21.277]  I mean, you're talking about a guy that's illiterate still.
[01:47:21.277 --> 01:47:22.358]  I'm still illiterate.
[01:47:22.358 --> 01:47:23.179]  Had never read a book.
[01:47:23.179 --> 01:47:25.200]  Well, look, this stuff's complex and you're busy anyways.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.702]  It's come out Ronald Reagan, not defending him.
[01:47:27.702 --> 01:47:28.283]  He didn't know.
[01:47:28.283 --> 01:47:31.685]  It was George Herbert Walker Bush running all that as well, keeping it from him.
[01:47:31.685 --> 01:47:34.687]  So if the president didn't know, Rick, I can't blame you for not knowing.
[01:47:34.687 --> 01:47:38.010]  Yeah, so I'm still a novice to all the stuff that's going on.
[01:47:38.928 --> 01:47:43.792]  But when it comes out, Gary runs it down to him, and he starts to tell me, and I'm like, I just got Gary.
[01:47:43.792 --> 01:47:45.954]  He's out there.
[01:47:45.954 --> 01:47:56.803]  So, the next thing I know, a couple days later, the OIG is at my cell, the CIA is at my cell, Congresswoman Maxine Waters is there.
[01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:59.366]  I mean, it just starts to pour.
[01:47:59.366 --> 01:48:00.727]  All these people are coming and coming.
[01:48:00.727 --> 01:48:02.488]  I'm like, what is going on?
[01:48:02.488 --> 01:48:03.209]  Let's talk about that.
[01:48:03.209 --> 01:48:05.291]  What did the CIA say to you when they came to your cell?
[01:48:06.127 --> 01:48:17.094]  Well, they started to talk to me about how much drugs I sold, who did I get my drugs from, did I have a contract with the CIA, and I was like, no, I ain't never been with the CIA, I don't know nothing about the CIA.
[01:48:17.094 --> 01:48:22.458]  They know you were compartmentalized, they wanted to act like, well, he refutes the story.
[01:48:22.458 --> 01:48:24.559]  Kinda, yeah, that's what they pretty much said.
[01:48:26.209 --> 01:48:28.211]  Uh, did I get drugs from Danilo Blandon?
[01:48:28.211 --> 01:48:30.453]  How long had I been getting drugs from him?
[01:48:30.453 --> 01:48:31.394]  Uh, that kind of stuff.
[01:48:31.394 --> 01:48:33.836]  And I was like, well, you guys want me to talk to you.
[01:48:33.836 --> 01:48:35.778]  Uh, why you don't straighten my court sentence out?
[01:48:35.778 --> 01:48:37.540]  You know, I got a life sentence.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:39.122]  Uh, will you straighten my court sentence out?
[01:48:39.122 --> 01:48:40.603]  No, we don't have anything to do with that.
[01:48:40.603 --> 01:48:42.465]  We're not going to help you with your courts.
[01:48:42.465 --> 01:48:46.088]  Uh, if you want to talk to us, you just talk to us and this is how we're going to do it.
[01:48:46.088 --> 01:48:46.569]  So, uh,
[01:48:47.845 --> 01:48:48.785]  That was pretty much their definition.
[01:48:48.785 --> 01:48:52.126]  By the way, they could have snapped their fingers and got you out in a few years.
[01:48:52.126 --> 01:48:53.586]  Yeah, yeah, I already know.
[01:48:53.586 --> 01:48:56.627]  But, you know, I was incorporating with what they wanted me to do, so.
[01:48:56.627 --> 01:49:04.308]  Well, that's why you're, you know, a hero overall, because more and more you had a chance once it came out that it had been going on to throw Gary Webb under the bus.
[01:49:04.308 --> 01:49:05.188]  You wouldn't do it.
[01:49:05.188 --> 01:49:06.249]  Oh, no, no.
[01:49:06.249 --> 01:49:10.649]  I respect what Gary does, what he did, and even... Well, you're right.
[01:49:10.649 --> 01:49:11.310]  He's still alive.
[01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:13.010]  I mean, he's living on through, yeah.
[01:49:13.450 --> 01:49:14.231]  Through a story?
[01:49:14.231 --> 01:49:24.738]  Absolutely, you know, and people, you know, they're always picking here and there about every little thing, you know, like, even with the movie, you know, what you didn't like about the movie?
[01:49:24.738 --> 01:49:26.019]  How did you like this?
[01:49:26.019 --> 01:49:30.742]  And, you know, it's like, hey, it's the spirit that people have to respect.
[01:49:30.742 --> 01:49:33.484]  I mean, this guy stood up for justice.
[01:49:33.484 --> 01:49:37.927]  He felt that even though I was selling drugs, that I still had rights that had to be
[01:49:39.588 --> 01:49:46.834]  Respect it and that we should be treated... You shouldn't be in jail when the CIA sold you the drugs!
[01:49:46.834 --> 01:49:50.277]  I've had the pilot on that was flying them in to the military base!
[01:49:51.670 --> 01:49:52.030]  Yeah.
[01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:54.031]  That they were then delivering to you every week.
[01:49:54.031 --> 01:49:59.674]  Yeah, and well, I don't, I didn't feel that way about myself, but I feel that way about guys right now in prison.
[01:49:59.674 --> 01:50:10.778]  Because right now, we have guys in prison that's been in prison 25 and 30 years, never shot anybody, never carried a gun, all they did was sold a lot of drugs, and got a lot of time, and they're still there right now today.
[01:50:10.778 --> 01:50:16.261]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the guns are down at the street level, where dealers might get robbed or something.
[01:50:16.261 --> 01:50:19.602]  Up at the top, other than bodyguards, I mean, were there ever guns?
[01:50:19.602 --> 01:50:19.982]  No.
[01:50:19.982 --> 01:50:21.023]  No, you didn't really need guns.
[01:50:22.813 --> 01:50:29.015]  The only time I would carry a gun if I went to a club or something like that and I think somebody might be gonna kidnap me or try to do something to me.
[01:50:29.015 --> 01:50:31.296]  It was only self-defense.
[01:50:31.296 --> 01:50:34.738]  Never... I mean, you got more money than you can ever spend.
[01:50:34.738 --> 01:50:35.758]  What are you gonna do with a gun?
[01:50:35.758 --> 01:50:38.859]  You know, guys who carry guns robbing people.
[01:50:38.859 --> 01:50:39.700]  That's because they're broke.
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:42.881]  When you got plenty of money, the only way you want a gun is to protect your money.
[01:50:42.881 --> 01:50:44.201]  That's right.
[01:50:44.201 --> 01:50:47.923]  That's what good guns are for, is protecting your family and your money.
[01:50:48.928 --> 01:50:53.131]  I got my mind on my family, and I got my hand on my gun.
[01:50:53.131 --> 01:50:55.933]  We'll be right back with Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:50:55.933 --> 01:50:57.074]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[01:51:25.314 --> 01:51:25.494]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:31.636 --> 01:51:32.637]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:32.637 --> 01:51:36.078]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:36.078 --> 01:51:37.758]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[01:51:37.758 --> 01:51:39.699]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:39.699 --> 01:51:45.541]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:45.541 --> 01:51:46.381]  I know, right?
[01:51:46.381 --> 01:51:47.682]  You love it, too!
[01:51:47.682 --> 01:51:49.122]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[01:51:49.122 --> 01:51:50.143]  Let's go get some!
[01:51:50.143 --> 01:51:51.903]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.

[01:52:00.822 --> 01:52:06.886]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[01:52:06.886 --> 01:52:12.649]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:19.593]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[01:52:19.853 --> 01:52:29.079]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[01:52:29.079 --> 01:52:32.101]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[01:52:32.101 --> 01:52:41.367]  One World Whey is a whey protein food that supports detoxification, repair of tissues, and elimination of inflammation, healthy pH, and growth of beneficial bacteria.
[01:52:41.607 --> 01:52:42.228]  We're good to go.
[01:53:00.111 --> 01:53:05.395]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[01:53:05.395 --> 01:53:12.341]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.
[01:53:12.341 --> 01:53:19.827]  If this sounds familiar, call us now, because we're shipping free bottles of Super Beta Prostate to listeners of this station.
[01:53:19.827 --> 01:53:26.512]  Super Beta Prostate is a non-prescription formula, guaranteed to reduce the symptoms of your enlarged prostate.

[01:53:31.396 --> 01:53:44.005]  In clinical trials, the ingredient in Super Beta Prostate was shown to reduce urges to urinate, improve bladder emptying, reduce waking at night to urinate, and improve quality of life.

[01:53:48.207 --> 01:53:49.668]  But it won't last.
[01:53:49.668 --> 01:53:50.589]  Don't wait.
[01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:51.089]  Just call 1-800-852-1820.
[01:53:51.089 --> 01:53:51.349]  That's 1-800-852-1820.
[01:53:51.349 --> 01:53:51.510]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[01:54:03.856 --> 01:54:06.677]  But it wasn't because I didn't know anything.
[01:54:29.517 --> 01:54:32.738]  I knew too much.
[01:54:32.738 --> 01:54:34.819]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:54:34.819 --> 01:54:35.459]  Does it?
[01:54:35.459 --> 01:54:40.521]  Does that make Gary Webb crazy?
[01:54:40.521 --> 01:54:41.662]  I think it does make me crazy.
[01:54:41.662 --> 01:54:45.103]  Because if you're in a land of nuts, if that makes you crazy, you don't go along with it.
[01:54:46.411 --> 01:54:47.551]  Reuters reports U.S.
[01:54:47.551 --> 01:54:51.213]  states plot legalization not in line with international law.
[01:54:51.213 --> 01:54:51.553]  U.N.
[01:54:51.553 --> 01:54:54.233]  says we can't decriminalize marijuana.
[01:54:54.233 --> 01:54:56.134]  See how we're going under global government?
[01:54:56.134 --> 01:55:00.775]  Obama says he'll put carbon taxes in on us even if Congress doesn't agree.
[01:55:00.775 --> 01:55:01.776]  Said that in China.
[01:55:01.776 --> 01:55:05.397]  See how we're living under these foreign banks' control?
[01:55:05.397 --> 01:55:07.538]  Parties come and go, but this continues.
[01:55:07.538 --> 01:55:07.898]  Look at this.
[01:55:07.898 --> 01:55:09.218]  This came out a few months ago.
[01:55:09.218 --> 01:55:13.079]  CIA admits destroying Gary Webb's career with the country's largest newspapers.
[01:55:13.079 --> 01:55:14.940]  We're going to talk about that next hour with our guest.
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.742]  We're going to get into a whole bunch of important news.
[01:55:17.742 --> 01:55:20.223]  Here's the latest story at Infowars.com.
[01:55:20.223 --> 01:55:26.428]  Russia announces deployment of bombers over the Gulf of Mexico as a new Cold War kicks off.
[01:55:26.428 --> 01:55:26.968]  Survey.
[01:55:26.968 --> 01:55:32.192]  Americans have smartened up to mass government spying and are totally against the NSA.
[01:55:32.192 --> 01:55:36.516]  DC School strips Christmas from calendar after Muslims complain.
[01:55:36.516 --> 01:55:39.238]  China jails CIA's Imams.
[01:55:40.157 --> 01:55:46.022]  And we have a second video emerging of the Obamacare architect calling American people stupid and admitting it's a rip-off.
[01:55:46.022 --> 01:55:50.746]  Continuing in the UN, causing all sorts of sterilization.
[01:55:50.746 --> 01:55:51.727]  They've been caught doing that.
[01:55:51.727 --> 01:55:57.052]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:57.052 --> 01:55:58.994]  Frederick E. Ross is our guest.
[01:55:59.574 --> 01:56:03.836]  He, of course, is played by a fictional, well, not a fictional character.
[01:56:03.836 --> 01:56:08.438]  He's played by an actor in an account of the real-life events that happened.
[01:56:08.438 --> 01:56:09.998]  It's almost like a documentary.
[01:56:09.998 --> 01:56:14.200]  Ian Kyl, the messenger, the hit movie out about the late Gary Webb.
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:22.843]  I want to hit this right now before we talk about what the CIA said to you, about your message to young people, about where you see the country and the world going.
[01:56:22.843 --> 01:56:26.985]  Then I want to open the phones up because they'll ask a lot of questions that I didn't think to ask.
[01:56:26.985 --> 01:56:28.226]  We're also going to send out a
[01:56:29.406 --> 01:56:38.353]  Twitter hashtag so folks can respond just whatever they want to come up with to ask questions of Rick Ross who's in studio with us.
[01:56:38.353 --> 01:56:43.917]  But in the few minutes we have before break, Rick, we've talked a lot about this.
[01:56:43.917 --> 01:56:45.558]  He was coming out with a new book.
[01:56:45.558 --> 01:56:47.139]  He was talking to me.
[01:56:47.139 --> 01:56:49.301]  He wasn't ready to come back on until his new book came out.
[01:56:49.301 --> 01:56:52.683]  He wanted me to put an online bibliography up of a bunch of documents.
[01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:56.352]  He was talking to a bunch of other people.
[01:56:56.352 --> 01:56:57.653]  He was talking to you.
[01:56:57.653 --> 01:57:00.155]  I talked to you right after they killed him.
[01:57:00.155 --> 01:57:02.918]  Or he committed suicide, as they say, in jail.
[01:57:02.918 --> 01:57:04.259]  You didn't buy it.
[01:57:04.259 --> 01:57:05.881]  He told you they'd been breaking into his house.
[01:57:05.881 --> 01:57:07.102]  He'd had to move.
[01:57:07.102 --> 01:57:08.563]  They'd threatened him.
[01:57:08.563 --> 01:57:12.888]  I like how the movie basically implies they killed him, but it ends before they kill him.
[01:57:12.888 --> 01:57:14.750]  This story of him shooting himself twice in the head.
[01:57:16.081 --> 01:57:18.201]  What did Gary Webb talk to you before he died?
[01:57:18.201 --> 01:57:21.282]  I mean, he talked to me about how he was very excited.
[01:57:21.282 --> 01:57:23.282]  He had all the proof to back up what he said.
[01:57:23.282 --> 01:57:25.103]  Yeah, he told me he was going to keep going.
[01:57:25.103 --> 01:57:29.884]  That he was going to get to the bottom of it and that he wasn't going to stop until he was done with it.
[01:57:29.884 --> 01:57:35.585]  And he did tell me about a new book that he was working on and he asked me if I would be a part of that as well.
[01:57:35.585 --> 01:57:41.106]  So, I mean, you know, I was talking to Kevin Booth when Kevin Booth is the one that told me about what happened.
[01:57:42.046 --> 01:57:43.810]  To Gary and I was like, what?
[01:57:43.810 --> 01:57:44.652]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:57:44.652 --> 01:57:46.737]  And right after when I spoke to you, you know,
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:52.102]  And that's when you asked me, you know, on air, was I thinking about committing suicide?
[01:57:52.102 --> 01:57:54.083]  And I was like, no, where did that come from?
[01:57:54.083 --> 01:57:58.345]  And I didn't really understand what she was doing until after I went back to myself and I thought about it.
[01:57:58.345 --> 01:58:06.890]  What you were doing was making sure that everybody knew that I was thinking right, that I wasn't planning on killing myself and that I was stable and whatnot.
[01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:08.931]  Yeah, I'm never going to commit suicide.
[01:58:08.931 --> 01:58:10.471]  You're never going to commit suicide?
[01:58:10.471 --> 01:58:11.352]  No, no, never.
[01:58:11.352 --> 01:58:14.594]  So if you get shot twice in the head, you didn't do it?
[01:58:14.594 --> 01:58:15.794]  I love my, absolutely.
[01:58:15.794 --> 01:58:17.035]  If I get shot once in the head,
[01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:20.212]  Gary Webb, you think they killed him?
[01:58:20.212 --> 01:58:22.174]  Uh, I mean, it looks like it to me.
[01:58:22.174 --> 01:58:29.959]  I mean, just, just... I'm not a forensic or anything like that, so I really can't say if it's possible that somebody could shoot themselves in the head twice.
[01:58:29.959 --> 01:58:37.785]  Uh, but it just seems odd to me that a person could take a gun and... Because I shot a gun before, and you shoot it and the gun does like this here.
[01:58:37.785 --> 01:58:40.307]  So, and you take... Stay there, we'll talk more about it back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:40.307 --> 01:58:47.832]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.431 --> 01:58:55.094]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:59.377]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:58:59.377 --> 01:59:01.158]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:59:01.158 --> 01:59:09.023]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:00:05.822 --> 02:00:07.123]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.123 --> 02:00:08.905]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.905 --> 02:00:10.667]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.667 --> 02:00:12.249]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.249 --> 02:00:13.790]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:17.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.995 --> 02:00:22.039]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.418 --> 02:00:34.820]  I tell you, you ought to hear what we're discussing during the breaks.
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:39.543]  Rick Ross on the ground floor of the CIA crack cocaine epidemic.
[02:00:39.543 --> 02:00:42.386]  He wants to get into hip-hop and how it's a weapon.
[02:00:42.386 --> 02:00:45.408]  And of course, a lot of insiders like Professor Griff and others have documented that.
[02:00:45.408 --> 02:00:48.450]  I've talked to famous people, but I can't say their names.
[02:00:48.450 --> 02:00:55.015]  Multiple major rock and roll stars who were in the meetings at MTV where they said, sorry, rock and roll's gone.
[02:00:55.015 --> 02:00:58.258]  We're bringing in the hip-hop, gangster rap, and we're weaponizing it.
[02:00:58.258 --> 02:00:59.519]  That's the word from the chiefs.
[02:01:00.396 --> 02:01:01.518]  And boy, they've done a job.
[02:01:01.518 --> 02:01:03.140]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:04.863]  Getting back to Gary Webb.
[02:01:04.863 --> 02:01:08.669]  When you went to the premiere, hung out with Renner, who also helped finance it.
[02:01:08.669 --> 02:01:09.851]  Did a great job.
[02:01:09.851 --> 02:01:11.273]  Knowing the story as good as I do.
[02:01:12.412 --> 02:01:15.193]  I was really freaked out because it was so accurate.
[02:01:15.193 --> 02:01:17.394]  Obviously, they couldn't show everything, but it was so accurate.
[02:01:17.394 --> 02:01:19.534]  They really, I think, captured his spirit.
[02:01:19.534 --> 02:01:21.075]  I really admire Renner now.
[02:01:21.075 --> 02:01:21.575]  I do too.
[02:01:21.575 --> 02:01:22.135]  I do too.
[02:01:22.135 --> 02:01:27.697]  And I met Renner at the screening, me, him, and Michael, and the director, and the head producer.
[02:01:27.697 --> 02:01:29.918]  We all took photos and whatnot, and it was just like...
[02:01:31.658 --> 02:01:33.459]  Almost like Gary was there, you know what I'm saying?
[02:01:33.459 --> 02:01:35.459]  Gary's wife was there, his kids were there.
[02:01:35.459 --> 02:01:42.061]  So for me, it was an opportunity to meet people that I had never met before, but I spoke on the phone.
[02:01:42.061 --> 02:01:52.783]  And to meet his wife and his kids and just the whole environment was like, man, everything that Gary was doing was still alive, you know, to know that he hadn't died.
[02:01:52.783 --> 02:01:59.705]  I wonder how his so-called friends at the newspaper that turned their back on him, I wonder how they feel now being so famous in this film.
[02:02:00.529 --> 02:02:05.772]  Well, yeah, you know, I spoke to Jesse Katz about his role, you know, inside the film.
[02:02:05.772 --> 02:02:14.316]  And, you know, we have Jesse inside of our documentary where he apologizes for basically being a hired gun.
[02:02:14.316 --> 02:02:21.540]  And gunning Gary down, he was saying that that's one of the lowest points that he filled in his journalism, that he did that.
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:22.840]  Now, it was the editor of the L.A.
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:23.881]  Times that was CIA.
[02:02:25.399 --> 02:02:33.328]  It may have been, but he hired Jesse to... No, no, I understand, but it actually comes out in the film, because they're saying, well, the LA Times says this, and he goes, well yeah, but he's CIA.
[02:02:33.328 --> 02:02:36.893]  And of course, he was never discredited.
[02:02:36.893 --> 02:02:40.397]  That's why they had to kill him, because they tried to kill...
[02:02:41.626 --> 02:02:45.789]  Well, you know, the Internet saved the story.
[02:02:45.789 --> 02:02:51.234]  I mean, if it wasn't for the Internet, the story would have been dead, you know, from the start.
[02:02:51.234 --> 02:02:57.538]  But the thing about it was so good is that it was the first time a major newspaper had ever released a story on the Internet.
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.423]  Once it hit that internet, you know, it just started going from person to person to person to person.
[02:03:04.423 --> 02:03:09.086]  And, you know, another thing, it was the first time that blacks had ever really came out on the internet the way they did.
[02:03:09.086 --> 02:03:16.732]  They really came out and... Oh, let's talk about that when we come back, and then we'll get into the hip-hop and your message to the young people, but...
[02:03:17.512 --> 02:03:22.539]  We ought to find those clips like where Mike Rupert confronts the CIA Director or Maxine Waters does.
[02:03:22.539 --> 02:03:26.484]  You can find it online, like Mike Rupert confronts CIA Director Maxine Waters does.
[02:03:26.484 --> 02:03:28.807]  And Deutsch just shuts down and then had to quit after that.
[02:03:28.807 --> 02:03:29.989]  I mean, people were mad.
[02:03:29.989 --> 02:03:31.351]  They're like, you put this on our streets?
[02:03:31.351 --> 02:03:32.452]  That was powerful.
[02:03:32.452 --> 02:03:33.233]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:33.233 --> 02:03:35.096]  When he came down to South Central at Locke High School.
[02:03:37.199 --> 02:03:37.920]  I want to get your take.
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:10.201]  And these people wanted the answers.
[02:04:10.201 --> 02:04:12.323]  They wanted to know why were the kids taken away so long.
[02:04:12.323 --> 02:04:19.467]  You know, I have about 11 friends that's been in prison right now, 26 years, from selling drugs.
[02:04:19.467 --> 02:04:20.928]  20, maybe even 30, some of them.
[02:04:20.928 --> 02:04:23.230]  So, people wanted answers.
[02:04:23.230 --> 02:04:27.593]  And Dutch felt that it would be better to address it than to let it keep simmering.
[02:04:27.593 --> 02:04:33.497]  And a big mistake he made, you know, by coming to South Central and confronting those people, because they really gave it to him.
[02:04:34.531 --> 02:04:39.576]  We're going to play the clips of Mike Rupert and others.
[02:04:39.576 --> 02:04:41.778]  I guess it was Maxine Waters visiting you in your cell.
[02:04:41.778 --> 02:04:43.559]  Who was the congresswoman that was there at that time?
[02:04:43.559 --> 02:04:44.220]  Juanita McDowell.
[02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:45.441]  Maxine Waters was there too.
[02:04:45.441 --> 02:04:45.781]  That's right.
[02:04:45.781 --> 02:04:46.862]  Okay, I'm going from memory here.
[02:04:46.862 --> 02:04:48.103]  They both was there.
[02:04:48.103 --> 02:04:49.284]  But they did find the clips.
[02:04:49.284 --> 02:04:51.106]  We'll play those when we come back.
[02:04:51.106 --> 02:04:53.848]  And we'll give the phone number out so you can have your questions and comments.
[02:04:53.848 --> 02:04:57.111]  And we'll take your Twitter questions at RealAlexJones.
[02:04:57.111 --> 02:04:57.532]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.621 --> 02:05:08.266]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:08.266 --> 02:05:13.411]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.411 --> 02:05:22.138]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:22.138 --> 02:05:25.701]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:25.701 --> 02:05:28.463]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.618 --> 02:05:42.441]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.441 --> 02:05:44.221]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:44.221 --> 02:05:47.102]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:47.102 --> 02:05:51.183]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:05:51.183 --> 02:05:53.723]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.723 --> 02:05:56.424]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:56.424 --> 02:05:58.004]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:58.004 --> 02:05:58.805]  Got it.
[02:05:58.805 --> 02:05:59.605]  Others don't.
[02:06:01.567 --> 02:06:02.888]  The experts are clear.
[02:06:02.888 --> 02:06:09.994]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:06:09.994 --> 02:06:16.280]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslive.com.
[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:19.863]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:06:20.003 --> 02:06:24.204]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:24.204 --> 02:06:29.526]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:29.526 --> 02:06:30.546]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:30.546 --> 02:06:34.348]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:06:34.348 --> 02:06:36.889]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:13.961 --> 02:07:21.049]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:24.190]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[02:07:24.190 --> 02:07:30.793]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:30.793 --> 02:07:41.697]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe
[02:07:41.877 --> 02:07:42.437]  We're good to go.
[02:08:12.891 --> 02:08:16.432]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:16.432 --> 02:08:23.855]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:23.855 --> 02:08:32.738]  I am a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective and I work South Central Los Angeles and I will tell you, Director Deutsch, emphatically... Can you speak further into the mic, sir?
[02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:41.981]  These mics don't seem to be... I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:08:49.778 --> 02:08:55.684]  All right.
[02:08:55.684 --> 02:08:57.525]  All right.
[02:08:57.525 --> 02:08:59.847]  All right.
[02:08:59.847 --> 02:09:03.251]  Obviously, that is an answer for a lot of you.
[02:09:03.251 --> 02:09:05.593]  Now, can you please- I refer- All right.
[02:09:05.593 --> 02:09:08.956]  Now, can you please- I refer to- Wait.
[02:09:08.956 --> 02:09:11.759]  Wait, wait, wait.
[02:09:11.759 --> 02:09:12.880]  Wait a minute.
[02:09:19.696 --> 02:09:22.017]  Wait a minute.
[02:09:22.017 --> 02:09:25.419]  Wait a minute here.
[02:09:25.419 --> 02:09:26.039]  Wait a minute.
[02:09:26.039 --> 02:09:29.541]  If you don't like what's going on here, please leave now.
[02:09:29.541 --> 02:09:31.862]  No, no, no.
[02:09:31.862 --> 02:09:32.343]  Leave.
[02:09:32.343 --> 02:09:33.023]  No, no, no.
[02:09:33.023 --> 02:09:36.745]  Leave now because there are others who do want to hear what's going on in this room.
[02:09:39.426 --> 02:09:51.248]  Alright, you can watch an hour of that famous C-SPAN footage, and of course it made Deutch resign a few weeks later, and then it caused an Inspector General report, and they admitted it.
[02:09:51.248 --> 02:09:52.589]  It all came out.
[02:09:52.589 --> 02:09:53.309]  That's the thing.
[02:09:53.309 --> 02:09:56.649]  People say, oh, government involvement, 9-11 will come out.
[02:09:56.649 --> 02:09:57.509]  It has.
[02:09:57.509 --> 02:09:59.630]  Government involvement sterilizing people will come out.
[02:09:59.630 --> 02:10:00.390]  It has.
[02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:02.350]  Government involvement shipping drugs in will come out.
[02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:03.070]  It has.
[02:10:03.070 --> 02:10:05.531]  It came out in the 60s, on the opium.
[02:10:06.854 --> 02:10:11.058]  The heroin in Southeast Asia, it's come out in Afghanistan.
[02:10:11.058 --> 02:10:19.885]  It went from 7% of world opium production in Afghanistan to 93%, that's the UN's own report, after our liberation of it.
[02:10:19.885 --> 02:10:25.610]  I don't need to play the Fox News clips again or CNN or ABC, them admitting our troops guard and grow the opium.
[02:10:25.610 --> 02:10:28.472]  Do you understand that, folks?
[02:10:28.472 --> 02:10:33.076]  And then, if your son or daughter is dumb enough to get on heroin,
[02:10:34.278 --> 02:10:40.079]  God forbid, or unlucky enough, they're going to throw them in jail when they shipped it in?
[02:10:40.079 --> 02:10:42.400]  That's crazy!
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:53.223]  That'd be like if you were a Mafia Don and ordered one of your guys to go rob a bank, and then the Mafia Don shows up in a police outfit and takes you to jail for robbing the bank when he publicly ordered him to do that.
[02:10:54.187 --> 02:10:56.167]  Freeway Ricky Ross is our guest.
[02:10:56.167 --> 02:11:01.289]  He wouldn't sell out Gary Webb and others, so they kept him in prison a lot longer than he should have been there.
[02:11:01.289 --> 02:11:06.870]  And again, I don't glorify drug dealing, but it's the fact that it's illegal that puts all this money into it.
[02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:14.871]  You regulate it, you make it a shameful thing to do, you don't have all these Hollywood movies promoting it on purpose to prime the pump, and it will go away.
[02:11:14.871 --> 02:11:18.972]  Areas of Europe have done that, and drug abuse has gone down about 50%.
[02:11:18.972 --> 02:11:20.473]  So it's because I don't like drugs.
[02:11:20.473 --> 02:11:21.573]  Folks, I don't use drugs.
[02:11:23.387 --> 02:11:26.551]  I get prescriptions sometimes, you know, if I'm sick.
[02:11:26.551 --> 02:11:27.372]  I drink coffee.
[02:11:27.372 --> 02:11:28.033]  I drink tea.
[02:11:28.033 --> 02:11:30.015]  Occasionally I drink beer or wine.
[02:11:30.015 --> 02:11:31.657]  But, I mean, that's it.
[02:11:31.657 --> 02:11:35.842]  It's the drug dealers that are currently operating in government and big banks and then low-level ones.
[02:11:35.842 --> 02:11:38.265]  They don't want it to be made legal or decriminalized.
[02:11:38.866 --> 02:11:40.067]  Rick Ross is our guest.
[02:11:40.067 --> 02:11:42.488]  We're going to be taking your phone calls coming up.
[02:11:42.488 --> 02:11:43.768]  It's the Sunday phone number today.
[02:11:43.768 --> 02:11:45.429]  We're running the whole show out of our operation.
[02:11:45.429 --> 02:11:46.049]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:11:46.049 --> 02:11:46.129]  877-789-2539.
[02:11:46.129 --> 02:11:46.910]  Callers for Rick Ross.
[02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:47.050]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:11:47.050 --> 02:11:47.110]  877-789-2539.
[02:11:47.110 --> 02:11:50.071]  And we've got your Twitter questions coming in at hashtag Rick Ross.
[02:12:04.057 --> 02:12:10.399]  Just tweet at us with hashtag Rick Ross on the IW chats at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[02:12:10.399 --> 02:12:12.559]  We've already got some of those questions pouring in.
[02:12:12.559 --> 02:12:30.124]  Rick, other points you want to make and then I know you want to get into hip-hop that you say is the new crack cocaine epidemic culture war machine and then I've got some amazing testimony I can give you on that exact fact backing up what you have to say.
[02:12:30.124 --> 02:12:31.705]  Tell folks what you told me off-air.
[02:12:32.489 --> 02:12:38.414]  Well, I believe that what they've done is they've taken hip-hop and they've made it glorious to be a drug dealer.
[02:12:38.414 --> 02:12:39.955]  You know, when I sold drugs, I hid.
[02:12:39.955 --> 02:12:41.817]  I didn't want anybody to know I sold drugs.
[02:12:41.817 --> 02:12:46.841]  But now, they got these guys who've never sold drugs, technically, you know.
[02:12:46.841 --> 02:12:50.824]  One guy was a correctional officer who goes by the name of Rick Ross now.
[02:12:50.824 --> 02:12:53.446]  He took my whole identity and the court said that he could do it.
[02:12:54.085 --> 02:13:00.270]  And he could prance around the country and say that he's me and take my whole life and use it and there was nothing I could do about it.
[02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:01.611]  I can't stop him.
[02:13:01.611 --> 02:13:03.793]  He even grew a beard just like you.
[02:13:03.793 --> 02:13:05.014]  Everything.
[02:13:05.014 --> 02:13:14.462]  So, now they take these guys and these guys say, well, I got to the position that I'm in right now today by selling drugs.
[02:13:14.462 --> 02:13:22.749]  So the message that it tells our kids is that if you go out, you sell drugs, then you can become a great rock star like myself.
[02:13:24.167 --> 02:13:26.228]  And never go to prison.
[02:13:26.228 --> 02:13:31.870]  And I think that that's a false message to be giving people who feel hopeless.
[02:13:31.870 --> 02:13:34.911]  And notice they don't indict the people that are fake and claim all that.
[02:13:34.911 --> 02:13:41.833]  No, no, they want them out there like a lantern fish has that light to get the little fish to swim over so they can eat them.
[02:13:42.541 --> 02:13:43.822]  Exactly, and that's what I believe.
[02:13:43.822 --> 02:13:52.849]  I mean, if I were to go on tape and say, oh yeah, I sold 300 kilos of cocaine, and now you got me admitting that I did that, they would indict me for it.
[02:13:52.849 --> 02:13:56.152]  But the way they're doing it now, they're saying it's just art form.
[02:13:56.152 --> 02:13:57.213]  It's just a form of art.
[02:13:57.213 --> 02:14:04.158]  And I believe that it's sucking in our kids and, you know, you turn on the radio and it's just filled with it.
[02:14:04.158 --> 02:14:05.660]  What do you want to say to Rick Ross?
[02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:06.941]  Because you'll probably see this video.
[02:14:07.501 --> 02:14:08.702]  Well, fake Rick Ross.
[02:14:08.702 --> 02:14:15.925]  I would tell him that it's time to change, that it's time to tell the kids the truth.
[02:14:15.925 --> 02:14:23.349]  You know, and let them know that technically he's never sold drugs and that he didn't get his money from selling drugs.
[02:14:23.349 --> 02:14:27.851]  That Universal gave him the money to do the things that he's doing.
[02:14:27.851 --> 02:14:31.232]  That it's okay to admit that you never did that.
[02:14:31.232 --> 02:14:36.555]  And not let our kids believe that they can go out and sell drugs and never pay a penalty for doing that.
[02:14:40.967 --> 02:14:44.408]  Does it make you angry to see him doing that?
[02:14:44.408 --> 02:14:47.769]  Well, really, the whole culture.
[02:14:47.769 --> 02:14:50.671]  I mean, I'm disappointed in the whole culture.
[02:14:50.671 --> 02:14:56.153]  Really, not really him, because I don't think that he understands what he's doing.
[02:14:56.153 --> 02:15:02.775]  To him, I believe that he's making a living and he's almost like I was when I sold drugs.
[02:15:05.276 --> 02:15:09.304]  So he don't understand... But you were actually doing it and taking the risk.
[02:15:09.304 --> 02:15:15.515]  He's out there selling this culture and this idea where young kids are going to go out and get their lives ruined or killed.
[02:15:15.515 --> 02:15:17.158]  In my book, that's a lot worse than what you did.
[02:15:18.619 --> 02:15:20.821]  At least you had your butt hanging out there.
[02:15:20.821 --> 02:15:24.484]  Yeah, and they're getting it to maybe even more people than I did.
[02:15:24.484 --> 02:15:34.532]  I mean, you know... Well, notice though, even though these guys are fake gangsters, they're always getting shot up and killed because real gangsters come after them or other people that think they're gangsters come after them.
[02:15:34.532 --> 02:15:35.753]  It's totally sick.
[02:15:35.753 --> 02:15:36.634]  It is, it is.
[02:15:36.634 --> 02:15:40.317]  But then, you know, you go to our schools and guess who you hear on the radio?
[02:15:40.317 --> 02:15:44.481]  Playing in a high school gym on the turntables.
[02:15:44.481 --> 02:15:45.221]  Guess who you hear on there?
[02:15:45.962 --> 02:15:46.783]  Jay-Z.
[02:15:46.783 --> 02:15:48.784]  Well, I'm glad you're speaking to high schools and colleges.
[02:15:48.784 --> 02:15:50.845]  We need to get you to just thousands of them.
[02:15:50.845 --> 02:15:52.006]  We need to shut this down.
[02:15:52.006 --> 02:15:58.310]  Well, you know, and you say that, that it's harder for me to get in with my message than it is for them.
[02:15:58.310 --> 02:16:08.696]  They'll pay these guys $100,000 to come there and tell the kids how much drugs they sold and how glorious it is to sell drugs, and they don't even want me on campus.
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:14.862]  Because you're going to tell them, it's the government, it'll ruin your life, don't touch it.
[02:16:14.862 --> 02:16:17.144]  And by the way, you're going to go to prison forever if you don't.
[02:16:17.144 --> 02:16:20.186]  And it's that message that will keep kids off drugs.
[02:16:20.186 --> 02:16:24.048]  Not the one of, oh, it's sexy and fun, and you want to get involved in this.
[02:16:24.048 --> 02:16:26.770]  This is how you really start rolling and getting all the chicks.
[02:16:26.770 --> 02:16:27.950]  No, you're not going to get any of that.
[02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:30.712]  You're going to end up getting TB in a prison cell.
[02:16:30.712 --> 02:16:31.752]  Exactly.
[02:16:31.752 --> 02:16:37.136]  And get your lights cut off at 7 o'clock at night.
[02:16:37.136 --> 02:16:39.277]  Told when to get up in the morning, when to go to bed.
[02:16:40.373 --> 02:16:43.534]  And how to live your life.
[02:16:43.534 --> 02:16:44.395]  It makes me sick.
[02:16:44.395 --> 02:16:46.576]  And they're going to give you a job.
[02:16:46.576 --> 02:16:47.977]  Oh, you can't get a job on the street?
[02:16:47.977 --> 02:16:49.998]  Oh, well they got a job for you in prison.
[02:16:49.998 --> 02:16:50.798]  It's called Unicor.
[02:16:50.798 --> 02:16:53.359]  And you're going to make money.
[02:16:53.359 --> 02:16:54.680]  Prison money.
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:56.320]  25 cent an hour.
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:58.822]  And the job that you're going to be doing, skillful job.
[02:16:58.822 --> 02:17:03.704]  Because people on the street, they get $35 an hour to do that same job.
[02:17:03.704 --> 02:17:05.865]  But we're only going to give you 25 cents.
[02:17:05.865 --> 02:17:07.126]  But that's all you need.
[02:17:07.126 --> 02:17:07.966]  Because we're going to feed you.
[02:17:09.434 --> 02:17:10.594]  House you.
[02:17:10.594 --> 02:17:13.355]  We wash your clothes for you.
[02:17:13.355 --> 02:17:15.436]  You have nothing to worry about in here.
[02:17:15.436 --> 02:17:20.098]  And then the good old boys sit around going, I hear they got hot tubs and cable in them prisons.
[02:17:20.098 --> 02:17:21.679]  I say make them work.
[02:17:21.679 --> 02:17:28.041]  And then they wonder why their son or daughter can't get a job in a factory because the factories are all built on the side of the prisons.
[02:17:28.041 --> 02:17:29.221]  For 25 cents an hour.
[02:17:29.221 --> 02:17:29.662]  Yep.
[02:17:29.662 --> 02:17:33.463]  And then they charge you as much as 50 cent a minute for a phone call.
[02:17:36.417 --> 02:17:42.538]  So you gotta work two hours to talk to your wife or your girlfriend or your son or daughter for two minutes?
[02:17:42.538 --> 02:17:44.019]  Yep.
[02:17:44.019 --> 02:17:45.679]  Absolutely.
[02:17:45.679 --> 02:17:51.000]  And then you know visits, they only let you visit twice a week.
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.161]  It is such an evil plan.
[02:17:53.161 --> 02:17:56.222]  And then you may be like I was, you know, where your family is in L.A.
[02:17:56.222 --> 02:18:00.503]  and they got you in Texarkana, Texas.
[02:18:00.503 --> 02:18:02.723]  So you may only see your family once a year.
[02:18:02.723 --> 02:18:05.444]  If you're lucky.
[02:18:05.444 --> 02:18:05.924]  If you're lucky.
[02:18:07.455 --> 02:18:13.817]  You look like you're about to cry thinking about all those kids getting sucked in by those spiders run by Universal and all the rest of them.
[02:18:13.817 --> 02:18:17.698]  I mean, they're setting up webs to catch kids and put them in that prison.
[02:18:17.698 --> 02:18:18.579]  Absolutely.
[02:18:18.579 --> 02:18:19.119]  Absolutely.
[02:18:19.119 --> 02:18:30.142]  When, you know, they got what they call now, I just spoke at a conference in San Francisco, they call it from Head Start to the prison pipeline.
[02:18:30.142 --> 02:18:35.804]  So they say they can tell right now, they got people that say they can tell right now a kid that's in kindergarten if he's going to prison.
[02:18:37.244 --> 02:18:48.431]  Well, I read a report, it was in mainstream news in New Mexico about two years ago, that the biggest prison corporation in the world was financing security at the school and was there admitting they're preparing those kids to go to prison.
[02:18:48.431 --> 02:18:52.113]  That the whole thing is just an induction pipeline right into the prison.
[02:18:52.113 --> 02:18:53.434]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:18:53.434 --> 02:18:54.294]  I can't believe it.
[02:18:54.294 --> 02:18:59.557]  I mean, how would people stand around and go for something like this here?
[02:18:59.557 --> 02:19:01.799]  I can't do it.
[02:19:01.799 --> 02:19:05.781]  Well, there are people like Professor Griff and others that are exposing what's happening in hip-hop.
[02:19:05.781 --> 02:19:06.322]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:07.470 --> 02:19:09.411]  I spoke to Pfeffers Griffin.
[02:19:09.411 --> 02:19:10.771]  We're planning on doing some things together.
[02:19:10.771 --> 02:19:12.191]  Yeah, he's a really great guy.
[02:19:12.191 --> 02:19:14.232]  Army veteran.
[02:19:14.232 --> 02:19:15.412]  Really smart guy.
[02:19:15.412 --> 02:19:16.753]  Trying to expose what's happening.
[02:19:16.753 --> 02:19:19.854]  Well, you know, the record labels are not going to touch those guys, though.
[02:19:19.854 --> 02:19:21.694]  Even though they're the real pioneers of hip-hop.
[02:19:21.694 --> 02:19:22.214]  Absolutely.
[02:19:22.214 --> 02:19:25.355]  But he can't get a record on the radio.
[02:19:25.355 --> 02:19:26.336]  Totally underground.
[02:19:26.336 --> 02:19:28.796]  It's going to be up to us, you know, the people in the streets.
[02:19:28.796 --> 02:19:30.777]  Like, you know, what you're doing right now.
[02:19:30.777 --> 02:19:33.558]  I mean, mainstream won't touch me.
[02:19:33.558 --> 02:19:34.478]  They won't give me an interview.
[02:19:35.245 --> 02:19:36.005]  They won't talk to me.
[02:19:36.005 --> 02:19:38.587]  A drug dealer in my studio?
[02:19:38.587 --> 02:19:40.807]  Never.
[02:19:40.807 --> 02:19:43.669]  Instead, you're the real Rick Ross saying don't use drugs.
[02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:48.571]  And they got the other Rick Ross running around making kids think it's sexy and they want him in the schools.
[02:19:48.571 --> 02:19:53.213]  That's because the spiders want to get those kids.
[02:19:53.213 --> 02:19:54.293]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:19:54.293 --> 02:19:54.654]  Stay there.
[02:19:54.654 --> 02:19:59.896]  I want to come back, get into anything else you want to cover and take phone calls and I'll tell you my story about the inside.

[02:22:02.745 --> 02:22:08.850]  Does your skin crawl when a politician or a stock market guru say that we are in the midst of an economic recovery?
[02:22:08.850 --> 02:22:13.013]  According to top insiders, the largest financial meltdown in history is coming.
[02:22:13.013 --> 02:22:17.317]  You can prepare, but if you're living paycheck to paycheck, how do you find the cash?
[02:22:17.317 --> 02:22:21.700]  If you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings, it's probably not enough.
[02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:25.443]  And if it's in the market, it could be wiped out just like the last crash.
[02:22:25.443 --> 02:22:28.426]  But this time it will almost certainly be much worse.
[02:22:28.706 --> 02:22:34.330]  Precious metals are a great hedge, but they won't generate immediate cash flow to pay the bills.

[02:24:19.175 --> 02:24:22.358]  Your Twitter questions, your phone calls when we start the next segment.
[02:24:22.358 --> 02:24:24.820]  Rick had more he wanted to say about quote, dumbing down.
[02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:29.504]  He was describing it like, well I guess training wheels on the kids right into prison.
[02:24:29.504 --> 02:24:30.665]  Get more into that Rick Ross.
[02:24:30.665 --> 02:24:34.609]  You were talking about hip-hop and how they program the kids on how they're supposed to act.
[02:24:34.989 --> 02:24:36.890]  Well, you know, like myself, Alex.
[02:24:36.890 --> 02:24:40.172]  They made me believe that I was dumb, that I couldn't read.
[02:24:40.172 --> 02:24:43.274]  And, you know, people ask me all the time, who was it?
[02:24:43.274 --> 02:24:45.395]  Was it my mom, who didn't teach me how to read?
[02:24:45.395 --> 02:24:46.515]  Was it the school?
[02:24:46.515 --> 02:24:47.916]  Well, I don't really know.
[02:24:47.916 --> 02:24:58.722]  But what I do know is that I had come up with a mentality about myself that I was dumb, that I was stupid, that all I should be was a thug.
[02:24:59.992 --> 02:25:03.774]  And that thugging was cool.
[02:25:03.774 --> 02:25:10.977]  And when I looked around from my prison cell and I started to look at all my friends, that they all thought the same way.
[02:25:10.977 --> 02:25:21.822]  And it was this programming that put us in this position that dealing drugs and gangbanging was easy for us to accept.
[02:25:21.822 --> 02:25:25.763]  And I believe that hip-hop is doing that right now, but on a more massive scale.
[02:25:27.699 --> 02:25:31.782]  The kids now, they wear their pants like we used to.
[02:25:31.782 --> 02:25:33.042]  They talk to things that we used to.
[02:25:33.042 --> 02:25:35.044]  They're ready for prison.
[02:25:35.044 --> 02:25:35.564]  Absolutely.
[02:25:35.564 --> 02:25:36.965]  They're ready to be punked.
[02:25:36.965 --> 02:25:37.945]  Absolutely.
[02:25:37.945 --> 02:25:38.446]  Absolutely.
[02:25:39.588 --> 02:25:40.669]  It's at an all-time high right now.
[02:25:40.669 --> 02:25:47.155]  It must be a joke to the CIA mind controllers to have the young guys already wearing their pants saying, hey, I'm ready to be raped.
[02:25:47.155 --> 02:25:52.240]  I mean, they must be really proud of the masterful job they've done.
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:55.443]  And now they're deploying that hip-hop culture into everything.
[02:25:55.443 --> 02:25:57.525]  It's taking over.
[02:25:57.845 --> 02:25:58.725]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:25:58.725 --> 02:26:06.447]  Endorsements, I mean, big companies, you know, companies that wouldn't touch that type of lifestyle before, you know, is all over.
[02:26:06.447 --> 02:26:11.728]  They don't want to have kids wearing sports jackets and doing well, and you've got a future, and you're a vet, no, you're crap.
[02:26:11.728 --> 02:26:15.789]  And now the rock and roll music's, oh, we're all dead, we have no future, humans are crud.
[02:26:15.789 --> 02:26:21.450]  They need us to feel bad about ourselves, that we're hurting the earth, so we roll over and basically become slaves.
[02:26:21.450 --> 02:26:21.950]  Absolutely.
[02:26:22.370 --> 02:26:24.332]  Other points you wanted to make before we got a break.
[02:26:24.332 --> 02:26:34.660]  And that's the point that I believe right now that our kids are in and that's why I'm out here on the streets working to let them know that, you know, I couldn't read but I eventually started doing law.
[02:26:35.711 --> 02:26:39.235]  You know, I found an issue that eventually helped me get out of prison.
[02:26:39.235 --> 02:26:42.659]  So, you know, I wrote a book now.
[02:26:42.659 --> 02:26:45.402]  And you're here warning people about drugs right now?
[02:26:45.402 --> 02:26:46.103]  Absolutely.
[02:26:46.103 --> 02:26:47.785]  And that's what matters is you've changed.
[02:26:47.785 --> 02:26:49.727]  You understand what you did wrong.
[02:26:49.727 --> 02:26:52.891]  And that's more valuable than somebody that never even went through the trials and tribulations.
[02:26:52.891 --> 02:26:53.432]  You're a veteran.
[02:26:53.832 --> 02:26:54.132]  Right.
[02:26:54.132 --> 02:26:57.933]  A veteran of this tyranny, and you're here seeing through the Matrix now.
[02:26:57.933 --> 02:26:58.793]  That's a beautiful thing.
[02:26:58.793 --> 02:27:09.016]  It's like Christ is on the cross, and he's there next to the thief and everything, and the thief apologizes, accepts it, his heart's right, and Christ says, tonight you'll be with me in paradise.
[02:27:09.016 --> 02:27:12.717]  But the soldiers and everybody, they just went along with it.
[02:27:12.717 --> 02:27:12.997]  Yeah.
[02:27:12.997 --> 02:27:16.718]  They think they're winners in this world, and they're not.
[02:27:16.718 --> 02:27:17.218]  Absolutely.
[02:27:19.571 --> 02:27:23.732]  Well, we've got to warn the young people to never use drugs the first time.
[02:27:23.732 --> 02:27:28.973]  I mean, marijuana is a gateway, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't decriminalize it just so they can't throw you in jail.
[02:27:28.973 --> 02:27:32.114]  But the whole drug culture is ruining people.
[02:27:32.114 --> 02:27:36.955]  And the prescription drugs are pushing on kids in the schools are worse than the illegal drugs.
[02:27:36.955 --> 02:27:38.735]  And just stay away from them.
[02:27:38.735 --> 02:27:41.576]  And realize you're not empty if you get bad grades.
[02:27:41.576 --> 02:27:43.336]  And so you've got to go to the dark side.
[02:27:43.336 --> 02:27:45.177]  You're not empty just because you don't have a bunch of money.
[02:27:45.757 --> 02:27:50.540]  You can paint, you can do music, you can go out and help people.
[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:59.327]  That's what's going to empower you is going out and standing up to bullies, not just feeling bad because you don't live like people on television.
[02:27:59.881 --> 02:28:02.642]  Yeah, we all can't be on television.
[02:28:02.642 --> 02:28:08.543]  It's crazy that they tell us that, you know, if you don't have a pair of Air Jordans, that you're not special.
[02:28:08.543 --> 02:28:16.706]  Well, I mean, I was happier before I had all this responsibility and was, quote, on radio and TV and barely had money to buy three pairs of shoes a year, even though that was rich compared to poor people.
[02:28:16.706 --> 02:28:17.886]  I mean, I was totally happy.
[02:28:17.886 --> 02:28:23.728]  I was thinking back to the years when I was, you know, out of high school and stuff and my parents were giving me no help because I didn't ask for it, really.
[02:28:23.728 --> 02:28:24.788]  And I was so poor.
[02:28:24.788 --> 02:28:28.269]  It was the happiest time of my life without all these responsibilities and the rest of it.
[02:28:28.709 --> 02:28:30.910]  And I'm not saying people shouldn't become successful.
[02:28:30.910 --> 02:28:34.032]  It's just that what matters is that you're a good person.
[02:28:34.032 --> 02:28:35.273]  That's the real value.
[02:28:35.273 --> 02:28:35.693]  It is.
[02:28:35.693 --> 02:28:36.174]  It is.
[02:28:36.174 --> 02:28:37.495]  And that you care about others.
[02:28:37.495 --> 02:28:43.318]  Because when you don't care about other people, then I believe that you're the worst.
[02:28:43.318 --> 02:28:47.341]  And a lot of people that's in power right now, they don't care about anything but your dollars.
[02:28:47.341 --> 02:28:49.102]  In fact, they enjoy hurting people.
[02:28:49.813 --> 02:28:50.134]  Yeah.
[02:28:50.134 --> 02:29:02.152]  I mean, it's a diabolical plan to ship heroin in to get millions of Americans addicted from the 50s on, and then to bring in cocaine, weaponize it as crack, which is a CIA recipe that was declassified, and to deploy it right into black neighborhoods.
[02:29:03.698 --> 02:29:05.719]  I mean, that's a nasty thing to do.
[02:29:05.719 --> 02:29:06.300]  It is.
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:07.321]  Absolutely.
[02:29:07.321 --> 02:29:09.742]  To a people that doesn't have, that's hopeless.
[02:29:09.742 --> 02:29:12.064]  And then to sell them thug culture.
[02:29:12.064 --> 02:29:18.668]  Cause let me tell you, you know, I'm downtown Austin and there's, you know, basically I call them black clan members, whatever, just black thug culture.
[02:29:18.668 --> 02:29:22.331]  There's white thug culture as well, but they've been sold it's okay to hate white people.
[02:29:22.331 --> 02:29:25.192]  I mean, it's, you know, it's, but I don't, I see the plan though.
[02:29:25.192 --> 02:29:29.095]  I see the whole programming to make them like that and to make them hate me.
[02:29:29.095 --> 02:29:33.198]  And then I realized how it's all to divide everybody so the system can manage us.
[02:29:33.198 --> 02:29:33.338]  Yeah.
[02:29:33.578 --> 02:29:35.358]  I mean, that's diabolical.
[02:29:35.358 --> 02:29:36.539]  Absolutely.
[02:29:36.539 --> 02:29:37.779]  That is sick.
[02:29:37.779 --> 02:29:39.019]  That is mind control.
[02:29:39.019 --> 02:29:41.480]  So we've got to transcend it, ladies and gentlemen, and defeat it.
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:43.160]  We'll get your take on what I just said when we come back.
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:45.941]  Rick Ross, go right to your phone calls and your Twitter questions.
[02:29:45.941 --> 02:29:47.681]  I'll stop hogging him right now.
[02:29:47.681 --> 02:29:50.642]  His website is IAmTheRealRickRoss.com.
[02:29:50.642 --> 02:29:51.902]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.902 --> 02:29:54.422]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.422 --> 02:29:57.103]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.315 --> 02:30:03.296]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:30:03.296 --> 02:30:07.817]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:30:07.817 --> 02:30:12.278]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:30:12.278 --> 02:30:19.600]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:28.663]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:30:28.883 --> 02:30:34.445]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:30:34.445 --> 02:30:42.029]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[02:30:42.029 --> 02:30:44.590]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:30:44.590 --> 02:30:49.672]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Info War.

[02:31:01.517 --> 02:31:11.182]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:31:11.182 --> 02:31:21.107]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:31:21.107 --> 02:31:24.029]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[02:31:24.249 --> 02:31:31.474]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:31:31.474 --> 02:31:36.157]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[02:31:36.157 --> 02:31:41.140]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:46.824]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:31:46.824 --> 02:31:52.168]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[02:31:52.168 --> 02:31:54.069]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com
[02:31:54.369 --> 02:31:57.631]  Or infowarestore.com to get started with OxyPowder.

[02:32:01.513 --> 02:32:07.756]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:32:07.756 --> 02:32:10.337]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:32:10.657 --> 02:32:17.463]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:32:17.463 --> 02:32:20.446]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:32:20.446 --> 02:32:23.409]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:32:23.409 --> 02:32:25.430]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:32:25.430 --> 02:32:28.333]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:32:28.353 --> 02:32:34.075]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:32:34.075 --> 02:32:37.577]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:32:37.577 --> 02:32:40.678]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:32:40.678 --> 02:32:44.960]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[02:32:45.100 --> 02:32:48.003]  For every modern, independently minded household.
[02:32:48.003 --> 02:32:51.206]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:33:12.609 --> 02:33:23.917]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.917 --> 02:33:25.878]  Rick Ross is our guest.
[02:33:25.878 --> 02:33:27.820]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:33:27.820 --> 02:33:30.782]  There was one other point when we got talking about fluoride in the water.
[02:33:30.782 --> 02:33:32.183]  What was the other point you wanted to make, you were saying?
[02:33:34.116 --> 02:33:35.577]  I lost my thought, man.
[02:33:35.577 --> 02:33:37.858]  We're having the real discussions here during the breaks.
[02:33:37.858 --> 02:33:46.163]  I thought so many times, just for the TV audience, I ought to have a button I can hit whenever I'm not eating or making a phone call where we can put live cams in here during the breaks.
[02:33:46.163 --> 02:33:46.383]  Yeah.
[02:33:46.383 --> 02:33:48.524]  Because that's where the really good discussions are happening.
[02:33:48.524 --> 02:33:49.264]  Yeah, that would be good.
[02:33:49.264 --> 02:33:49.945]  That would be good.
[02:33:49.945 --> 02:33:57.169]  But, you know, we done touched on so many good points, man, and I'm just excited, you know, that you had me here and that we're touching on some of these points.
[02:33:57.589 --> 02:34:12.767]  You know, one of them too, you know, Obama, he wrote in the 1801 crack law, you know, where it was 101 for crack and powder, where it had already been proven that powder and crack are identical drugs, except one is smokable and one is not smokable.
[02:34:14.348 --> 02:34:20.370]  So, about a year ago, they changed it to 18 to 1, but they should have made it 18 to 1, and then they should have made it retroactive.
[02:34:20.370 --> 02:34:30.733]  You know, say if a guy's been in jail 25 or 30 years, but if it was 18 to 1, he would only got 5 years in prison, so they would owe him some time, he would be released.
[02:34:30.733 --> 02:34:31.794]  Well, I totally agree.
[02:34:31.794 --> 02:34:34.675]  If you're non-violent, you should be released.
[02:34:34.675 --> 02:34:35.455]  Period.
[02:34:35.455 --> 02:34:37.055]  Because the government shipped it in to begin with.
[02:34:37.055 --> 02:34:38.396]  It'd be like, if you're a judge,
[02:34:39.417 --> 02:34:45.659]  Was the guy that sold you the cocaine, and then now he's presiding over sending you to jail for life.
[02:34:45.659 --> 02:34:46.540]  That's what it is.
[02:34:46.540 --> 02:34:50.421]  It'd be like if Hitler ran the Nuremberg Trials.
[02:34:50.421 --> 02:34:52.622]  I mean, it's just, it's pure bull.
[02:34:52.622 --> 02:34:53.202]  I mean, end it!
[02:34:53.202 --> 02:34:54.342]  Yes, it is.
[02:34:54.342 --> 02:34:56.103]  And then they own the prisons.
[02:34:56.103 --> 02:34:57.163]  I remember.
[02:34:57.163 --> 02:35:02.825]  I've talked to two major rock stars, and it's not the two that you've heard on the show.
[02:35:02.825 --> 02:35:04.346]  I've talked to two major rock stars.
[02:35:05.623 --> 02:35:07.064]  And then I've talked to some hip-hop folks.
[02:35:07.064 --> 02:35:09.845]  They all say that they've heard the same stories.
[02:35:09.845 --> 02:35:16.008]  And some of the memos have come out about the CIA behind rock and roll to create the revolutions, you know, behind bringing the LSD in.
[02:35:16.008 --> 02:35:16.969]  That's been declassified.
[02:35:16.969 --> 02:35:20.231]  But in the early 90s, they said, look, rock's going to be dead.
[02:35:20.231 --> 02:35:21.091]  Get ready.
[02:35:21.091 --> 02:35:22.232]  We're going to bring in hip-hop.
[02:35:22.972 --> 02:35:24.453]  And we're going to gangsterize it.
[02:35:24.453 --> 02:35:26.514]  This is from the guys upstairs.
[02:35:26.514 --> 02:35:28.355]  The government wants this.
[02:35:28.355 --> 02:35:31.737]  Shumner Redstone at Viacom has been ordered to do this.
[02:35:31.737 --> 02:35:36.840]  And big managers and people were all brought in and they said, you better start flipping to this.
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:42.463]  That's why you saw a lot of heavy metal guys start doing rap albums and getting other folks in with them and things.
[02:35:42.463 --> 02:35:45.325]  Because they were told, we're going to play these on the record.
[02:35:45.325 --> 02:35:47.686]  And we're going to put this on the air.
[02:35:47.686 --> 02:35:49.347]  And then I talk about my personal self.
[02:35:50.692 --> 02:35:53.313]  I experimented here and there once or twice with hard drugs.
[02:35:53.313 --> 02:35:55.654]  Always had such horrible hangovers.
[02:35:55.654 --> 02:35:57.615]  Methamphetamine a couple times, cocaine a few times.
[02:35:57.615 --> 02:35:59.216]  I'm on record about that.
[02:35:59.216 --> 02:36:01.017]  I just didn't like it.
[02:36:01.017 --> 02:36:04.539]  I've always been a nicotine alcohol type guy and that I've transcended pretty much as well.
[02:36:04.539 --> 02:36:05.679]  Don't even smoke cigars anymore.
[02:36:05.679 --> 02:36:07.620]  I always get back on cigarettes when I do.
[02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:11.682]  But, long story short, Sheriff McWhorter
[02:36:13.683 --> 02:36:16.864]  Who later got busted, he was flying drugs into the Rockwall Airport.
[02:36:16.864 --> 02:36:20.584]  We lived in the richest county in Texas, right outside Dallas, Rockwall-on-the-Lake.
[02:36:20.584 --> 02:36:24.885]  And I would be at affluent people's houses for a party when their parents were out of town.
[02:36:24.885 --> 02:36:35.067]  The cheerleader down the street's having a party, all 14-year-olds are over there, and then there'd be 16-year-olds and 18-year-olds would come over, wild parties, pool parties, and the police car would pull up.
[02:36:35.067 --> 02:36:40.748]  And then they'd come in and go, we got the weed, we got the ecstasy, we got the methamphetamine, we got the... And I'd be like, whoa, whoa!
[02:36:41.448 --> 02:36:43.392]  You know, because they had money.
[02:36:43.392 --> 02:36:46.558]  And so many times the cops in cars would deliver the drugs.
[02:36:46.558 --> 02:36:49.785]  So I'd get pulled over a couple years later when I was driving.
[02:36:49.785 --> 02:36:51.428]  That's why we had to move to Austin.
[02:36:52.546 --> 02:36:55.249]  I've told them this has been in Esquire, it's been in Texas Monthly.
[02:36:55.249 --> 02:36:56.151]  They didn't believe a lot of it.
[02:36:56.151 --> 02:37:01.737]  Went and checked and went, wow, there were a bunch of busts in the Rockwall PD and the county and flying in cocaine.
[02:37:01.737 --> 02:37:02.458]  I remember that.
[02:37:02.458 --> 02:37:03.059]  I remember that.
[02:37:03.059 --> 02:37:05.382]  It was in the newspapers and Reddit.
[02:37:05.382 --> 02:37:11.029]  So they were flooding it with drugs and they would want to search my car and I'd go, man, I saw you two years ago deliver drugs.
[02:37:12.190 --> 02:37:17.873]  Beat me up, take me to jail, threatened to hang me, told my dad's lawyer, move out or we're gonna kill him, basically.
[02:37:17.873 --> 02:37:18.454]  Yeah.
[02:37:18.454 --> 02:37:22.556]  And a couple years, we moved out, and then later the feds came in and busted him.
[02:37:22.556 --> 02:37:25.758]  But again, that's the big drug dealer busting the little drug dealer.
[02:37:25.758 --> 02:37:28.840]  Yeah, well you know, that's why they don't like you, Alex, because you're gonna keep it 100.
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:31.581]  You're gonna let them know exactly what's going on.
[02:37:31.581 --> 02:37:35.644]  Well, I wasn't saying anything about the cops stealing drugs until they wanted to search me.
[02:37:35.644 --> 02:37:36.684]  Yeah.
[02:37:36.684 --> 02:37:39.026]  And I'm like, man, you're a drug dealer!
[02:37:39.026 --> 02:37:40.727]  Leave my six pack of beer alone!
[02:37:42.569 --> 02:37:48.450]  Oh, look, you know, like under the truck seat, those Silverados had the seat that lifted up the middle.
[02:37:48.450 --> 02:37:48.770]  Yeah.
[02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:49.791]  And there was the six pack.
[02:37:49.791 --> 02:37:50.831]  We weren't even drinking and driving.
[02:37:50.831 --> 02:37:52.011]  We were going to a party.
[02:37:52.011 --> 02:37:54.131]  And they're like, all right, I got you a minor in possession.
[02:37:54.131 --> 02:37:58.132]  I was just like, you're a drug dealer.
[02:37:58.132 --> 02:38:00.893]  Almost like the fox watching the hen house, huh?
[02:38:00.893 --> 02:38:02.413]  Well, yeah, it's like you're a drug dealer.
[02:38:02.413 --> 02:38:05.154]  You're going to give me a ticket, take my beer.
[02:38:05.154 --> 02:38:05.974]  Those cops would just go.
[02:38:07.605 --> 02:38:09.326]  They arrested me three times doing that.
[02:38:09.326 --> 02:38:10.206]  Wow.
[02:38:10.206 --> 02:38:11.767]  They would beat me up bad bad.
[02:38:11.767 --> 02:38:14.327]  They'd slam my head in the wall and they'd take me there and go, listen.
[02:38:14.327 --> 02:38:15.688]  They didn't beat you with a flashlight?
[02:38:15.688 --> 02:38:16.248]  No, no.
[02:38:16.248 --> 02:38:16.988]  You've been beat up before.
[02:38:16.988 --> 02:38:20.950]  I've been beat with a flashlight while I was handcuffed and let the dog bite me while I was handcuffed.
[02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:25.171]  I mean, these guys are wow, wow.
[02:38:25.171 --> 02:38:27.112]  You know, these, what do you call them?
[02:38:27.112 --> 02:38:28.092]  Cowboys?
[02:38:28.092 --> 02:38:29.073]  Yeah.
[02:38:29.073 --> 02:38:30.413]  Drug enforcement agents?
[02:38:30.413 --> 02:38:32.514]  You know, they're just out there, man.
[02:38:32.514 --> 02:38:34.075]  Most of them are dealers.
[02:38:34.075 --> 02:38:34.935]  Yeah, running rampant.
[02:38:36.010 --> 02:38:39.174]  And, you know, ripping off the public.
[02:38:39.174 --> 02:38:41.056]  Because they're not solving the problem.
[02:38:41.056 --> 02:38:45.782]  Well, now they're so arrogant, even the New York Times reports on it, they're taking people's cash out of their wallets.
[02:38:45.782 --> 02:38:47.544]  They have no criminal record, no drugs.
[02:38:47.544 --> 02:38:49.066]  They just go, oh, two grand in your wallet?
[02:38:49.066 --> 02:38:49.847]  Bam, I'm taking it.
[02:38:49.847 --> 02:38:51.790]  Well, you know, Gary stopped that, too.
[02:38:51.790 --> 02:38:53.151]  You remember, they used to have a forfeiture.
[02:38:53.882 --> 02:38:54.762]  Remember the forfeiture laws?
[02:38:54.762 --> 02:38:56.363]  He got it kicked out of the states, yeah.
[02:38:56.363 --> 02:38:58.204]  He made them change their forfeiture laws.
[02:38:58.204 --> 02:39:06.707]  You know, before they could pull you over and say they found a joint in your car and they could take your car and forfeit it.
[02:39:06.707 --> 02:39:10.569]  You go to court and the court throw your case out and you never go to jail and never found guilty.
[02:39:10.569 --> 02:39:14.430]  He did get it reformed but now they came back where the feds federalized it and they do it now.
[02:39:14.430 --> 02:39:15.011]  Through the police.
[02:39:15.811 --> 02:39:16.971]  But Gary did do so much.
[02:39:16.971 --> 02:39:18.431]  Let's go to these calls here.
[02:39:18.431 --> 02:39:19.412]  Folks, get his book.
[02:39:19.412 --> 02:39:33.114]  It's available right now at InfoWarsStore.com or you can go to FreewayRick.com or IAmTheRealRickRoss.com and get the book, Rick Ross, The Untold Autobiography, and give it to the young people in your life, especially any that are getting on drugs.
[02:39:33.114 --> 02:39:39.095]  Donnie McClure asked the question on Twitter, can you elaborate on the rapper Rick Ross and how he stole your image?
[02:39:39.095 --> 02:39:40.475]  I think you already answered that.
[02:39:40.475 --> 02:39:41.616]  And do you like his music?
[02:39:41.616 --> 02:39:42.696]  Do you like his music?
[02:39:42.696 --> 02:39:42.916]  I do.
[02:39:43.736 --> 02:39:44.176]  I do.
[02:39:44.176 --> 02:39:44.777]  You can't help it.
[02:39:44.777 --> 02:39:48.399]  I mean, they have a formula that they're doing with this music.
[02:39:48.399 --> 02:39:51.161]  And, you know, our heart beats off of a rhythm.
[02:39:51.161 --> 02:39:53.042]  So they manipulate us, yeah?
[02:39:53.042 --> 02:39:53.802]  Absolutely.
[02:39:53.802 --> 02:40:03.028]  So, and then you hear the music, if you turn on the radio, and I don't really listen to the radio when I like it, you know, because you can't help but hear this music everywhere you go.
[02:40:03.028 --> 02:40:07.950]  You know, you're on the elevator, you're here, you're in the supermarket, you're riding down the street and somebody else is playing in the car.
[02:40:07.950 --> 02:40:10.472]  Well, that's what makes me mad is my kids can't help but like it.
[02:40:10.772 --> 02:40:11.473]  Absolutely.
[02:40:11.473 --> 02:40:13.774]  And if the message was good, it'd be great, but it's weaponized.
[02:40:13.774 --> 02:40:14.875]  The message is bad.
[02:40:14.875 --> 02:40:15.495]  Yeah, it's not.
[02:40:15.495 --> 02:40:20.919]  Motivation, uplifting, you know, telling that you can be somebody special and that you are special no matter what situation.
[02:40:20.919 --> 02:40:26.463]  No, it's like, you gotta be a gangster slinging a rock, the hoes, the, you know.
[02:40:26.463 --> 02:40:28.504]  You got it.
[02:40:28.504 --> 02:40:30.345]  Yeah.
[02:40:30.345 --> 02:40:32.527]  Rick Ross, did you do any business with the CIA?
[02:40:32.527 --> 02:40:33.467]  Well, that's a silly question.
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:36.980]  Not knowingly.
[02:40:36.980 --> 02:40:38.921]  Yeah, they had an intermediary between you and them.
[02:40:38.921 --> 02:40:41.762]  Yeah, yeah, Danilo Blandon, the CIA operative.
[02:40:41.762 --> 02:40:42.842]  That's what they call it.
[02:40:42.842 --> 02:40:44.602]  He's not an agent, but he's an operative.
[02:40:44.602 --> 02:40:49.003]  It's a membrane.
[02:40:49.003 --> 02:40:51.284]  Do you know Henry Hill?
[02:40:51.284 --> 02:40:52.664]  Was or ever met Henry Hill?
[02:40:52.664 --> 02:40:55.185]  And if so, how much of a piece of bleep was he?
[02:40:55.185 --> 02:40:56.065]  I don't even know who that is.
[02:40:56.065 --> 02:40:56.905]  No, me either.
[02:40:56.905 --> 02:40:57.505]  Never heard of him.
[02:40:57.505 --> 02:40:58.885]  All right.
[02:40:58.885 --> 02:41:00.326]  We've got more Twitter questions coming in.
[02:41:00.326 --> 02:41:01.026]  We're gonna go to calls.
[02:41:02.973 --> 02:41:07.934]  MKT says, what was your first major purchase after making all your drug money?
[02:41:07.934 --> 02:41:09.735]  My first major purchase?
[02:41:09.735 --> 02:41:12.355]  I bought a piece of property that I built a motel on.
[02:41:12.355 --> 02:41:14.516]  That's smart.
[02:41:14.516 --> 02:41:22.578]  Adam Russell asks on iChats, Rick, do you think the government was involved in creating the fake rappers persona to basically troll you?
[02:41:22.578 --> 02:41:23.858]  Sure, I don't think Rick Ross came up with that.
[02:41:25.071 --> 02:41:35.638]  I don't know if they did it to, I don't know what troll me mean, uh, but what I know that happened is they gave it him authenticity, you know, where it was, I thought it was authentic.
[02:41:35.638 --> 02:41:35.858]  Yeah.
[02:41:38.775 --> 02:41:41.096]  In my community, I'm a legend.
[02:41:41.096 --> 02:41:44.538]  You know, people's mothers and fathers have talked about me.
[02:41:44.538 --> 02:41:47.939]  So it had already been ingrained in people that Rick Ross was something.
[02:41:47.939 --> 02:41:56.623]  And so when the name came out, people automatically liked that name because they looked at me as almost like a Robin Hood.
[02:41:56.623 --> 02:41:58.744]  Well, Rick Ross rolls off the tongue.
[02:41:58.744 --> 02:41:59.744]  It sounds cool.
[02:41:59.744 --> 02:42:00.004]  Yeah.
[02:42:02.443 --> 02:42:05.886]  When they did him, he already had love for the community.
[02:42:05.886 --> 02:42:07.246]  The community already had love for him.
[02:42:07.246 --> 02:42:16.733]  I had, uh, I don't know if you know who Freddie Fox is, but Freddie Fox told me one time, he was like, man, when I heard that Rick Ross was performing in New York, I went to the show.
[02:42:16.733 --> 02:42:20.496]  And when I got to the show, I see this guy and I was like, that ain't none of my man.
[02:42:20.496 --> 02:42:24.179]  You know, that's, so they already had a love for Rick Ross.
[02:42:24.179 --> 02:42:29.382]  And what he did is he got that love that the streets had for me, you know, cause I was a gangster.
[02:42:29.382 --> 02:42:31.244]  I was out there in the streets and, and, and,
[02:42:32.279 --> 02:42:42.405]  That's what they wanted, and he fitted that role, so... What are some of the things that motivate you today, KDEE asked?
[02:42:42.405 --> 02:42:58.675]  Well, uh, redemption, you know, to redeem myself, uh, to show young people that, um, no matter where you at today, that you can always, uh, improve yourself and become a better person.
[02:42:58.675 --> 02:43:01.337]  How do you pronounce that caller's name, Vladislav?
[02:43:02.791 --> 02:43:03.874]  Vladislav?
[02:43:03.874 --> 02:43:06.200]  Then we're gonna go to Vladislav here in just a moment.
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:09.469]  In fact, let's go to Vladislav now in Washington.
[02:43:09.469 --> 02:43:11.314]  You're on the air with the real Rick Ross.
[02:43:13.032 --> 02:43:13.752]  Hello, Rick.
[02:43:13.752 --> 02:43:16.754]  My name is Vladislaus here in Battleground Washington.
[02:43:16.754 --> 02:43:19.035]  My question is very basic to you.
[02:43:19.035 --> 02:43:22.957]  Basically, what motivated you to deal the drugs with the CIA?
[02:43:22.957 --> 02:43:24.578]  And afterwards, what changed your mind?
[02:43:24.578 --> 02:43:25.818]  But has anybody been listening?
[02:43:25.818 --> 02:43:36.063]  He didn't know he was dealing drugs with the CIA until it came out in court because the operative that was a supplier from the Air Force Base hadn't told him that.
[02:43:36.063 --> 02:43:38.645]  So I don't mean to answer his question for you, but...
[02:43:39.525 --> 02:43:41.145]  I mean, what motivated you to deal drugs?
[02:43:41.145 --> 02:43:41.885]  I think you said that.
[02:43:41.885 --> 02:43:42.466]  Money, right?
[02:43:42.466 --> 02:43:43.086]  Poverty.
[02:43:43.086 --> 02:43:43.726]  Money.
[02:43:43.726 --> 02:43:44.526]  Yeah.
[02:43:44.526 --> 02:43:50.627]  I was tired of my mom struggling and not having food in the refrigerator.
[02:43:50.627 --> 02:43:55.008]  You know, there's been days that me and my brothers and sisters woke up and there was nothing in there to eat.
[02:43:55.008 --> 02:43:56.148]  I've got a question to ask you.
[02:43:56.148 --> 02:43:56.728]  Thank you, caller.
[02:43:56.728 --> 02:43:57.128]  I appreciate it.
[02:43:57.128 --> 02:43:57.788]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[02:43:57.788 --> 02:44:02.349]  He just answered that.
[02:44:02.349 --> 02:44:08.750]  What does your mother think, kind of like that Scarface story, what does your mother think when suddenly you have all this money?
[02:44:09.534 --> 02:44:13.015]  Well, you know, my mom put me out of the house when she first found out I was dealing drugs.
[02:44:13.015 --> 02:44:15.495]  You know, my mom was a diorite Christian.
[02:44:15.495 --> 02:44:19.436]  And, uh, you know, first thing came to her mind, Oh, you're going to hell forever.
[02:44:19.436 --> 02:44:21.297]  So, uh, she threw me out the house.
[02:44:21.297 --> 02:44:25.058]  Uh, but when she did, I was already, I was already ghetto rich.
[02:44:25.058 --> 02:44:27.558]  I had a hundred thousand dollars.
[02:44:27.558 --> 02:44:31.239]  So everybody in the neighborhood wanted me to come to their house and stay.
[02:44:31.239 --> 02:44:35.360]  Uh, but eventually she, she started to succumb to the money.
[02:44:36.107 --> 02:44:48.319]  You know, I bought pool pits for the church and air conditioners and, you know, I remodeled her house where she didn't have holes in the floors and had exterminated, you know, put the tent over to get rid of the rats and the roaches.
[02:44:48.319 --> 02:44:52.604]  And I was still her son.
[02:44:52.604 --> 02:44:57.268]  So no matter what happened, you know, she still loved me and adored me.
[02:44:58.738 --> 02:44:59.800]  Our relationship never changed.
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:00.180]  That's right.
[02:45:00.180 --> 02:45:02.323]  There's nothing more powerful than the flesh.
[02:45:02.323 --> 02:45:04.225]  Flesh of my flesh.
[02:45:04.225 --> 02:45:05.887]  Let's go to Julio in Wyoming.
[02:45:05.887 --> 02:45:07.850]  Julio, welcome to the Airwaves with Rick Ross.
[02:45:07.850 --> 02:45:08.410]  What up Julio?
[02:45:09.437 --> 02:45:11.458]  Hey, what's going on Rick Ross?
[02:45:11.458 --> 02:45:21.045]  I first learned about you in college when I was a sophomore, when I first heard about Alex Jones, and I want to say God bless you for what you're doing and speaking out against the drug culture.
[02:45:21.045 --> 02:45:26.908]  Studying media in college, it's clear we have this predictive program society.
[02:45:26.908 --> 02:45:35.414]  A quick story I want to share, just living in Wyoming for a couple months, I've interacted with someone who I work with at my radio station, his brother-in-law,
[02:45:36.204 --> 02:45:51.044]  He works for a pharmaceutical company and he legally, I used air quotes on that, legally purchases methamphetamines and cocaine for the big drug manufacturers and they go all over the country to pick up legal purchases.
[02:45:52.365 --> 02:45:56.427]  But I completely agree with what you and Alex are talking about with predictive programming.
[02:45:56.427 --> 02:46:02.109]  There was a movie that came out, what, a couple years ago, Two Guns, with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.
[02:46:02.109 --> 02:46:04.891]  And again, they kind of just threw it in our face.
[02:46:04.891 --> 02:46:06.972]  They just admit the CIA is bringing the drugs in.
[02:46:06.972 --> 02:46:10.453]  It's all just flapping it in our face.
[02:46:10.453 --> 02:46:13.714]  They admit the Army, the Air Force, they're all doing this.
[02:46:13.714 --> 02:46:19.217]  My question to you, Rick Ross, is what's one of the biggest keys
[02:46:19.941 --> 02:46:23.103]  For us to talk to the youth about drugs.
[02:46:23.103 --> 02:46:29.406]  Here in Wyoming, the Native American culture, they're in a huge rat hole because of methamphetamine use.
[02:46:29.406 --> 02:46:38.970]  And the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is basically the FBI for Native Americans, they're the ones who are helping push methamphetamine use here.
[02:46:38.970 --> 02:46:40.011]  So how do we talk to
[02:46:42.791 --> 02:46:43.451]  To the people.
[02:46:43.451 --> 02:46:45.672]  How do we even engage the police officers?
[02:46:45.672 --> 02:46:54.696]  At Schaumburg, Illinois, a big suburb of Chicago, recently they've been caught dealing drugs themselves and stealing it from drug dealers and pushing it on the culture.
[02:46:54.696 --> 02:46:55.836]  Well, that's it.
[02:46:55.836 --> 02:46:57.177]  And look, they have to stop.
[02:46:58.379 --> 02:47:08.705]  They got rid of alcohol prohibition, now they brought in this new prohibition, and now they want to grab our kids, and it's just, there's never enough, and they laugh on TV and pass Obamacare that's a giant screwjob.
[02:47:08.705 --> 02:47:10.727]  I mean, this thing is out of control.
[02:47:10.727 --> 02:47:12.268]  They're killing the golden goose.
[02:47:12.268 --> 02:47:13.969]  Rick Ross, how do we stop a drug war?
[02:47:14.349 --> 02:47:17.113]  I think what you're doing right now, Alex, is a start.
[02:47:17.113 --> 02:47:18.435]  This is how you got to get started.
[02:47:18.435 --> 02:47:22.000]  Because, you know, you're talking about fighting the thousand-pound gorilla.
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:25.384]  And you're not going to whoop him, you know, just go and hit up with him.
[02:47:25.384 --> 02:47:29.110]  And you got to sit down and think and talk like Alex is doing right now.
[02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:31.172]  And, you know, most people don't even want to talk about these issues.
[02:47:31.693 --> 02:47:36.376]  That's right, you gotta force it out there till everybody knows, and it's starting to happen.
[02:47:36.376 --> 02:47:44.500]  Yeah, and once you start to do that, then you can start attacking it, because when people are dumb, and remember how I was?
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:50.403]  I was dumb, illiterate, you know, I never read a book, you know, never heard Alex Jones, or nothing.
[02:47:50.403 --> 02:47:54.525]  I didn't know anything, so anything that somebody brought to me, I went for it.
[02:47:54.525 --> 02:48:00.729]  You know, they bring it to you, oh this is for you, it's good for you, take it and use it, and this is how you do it, and then you find yourself caught up in stuff that
[02:48:01.987 --> 02:48:03.147]  You never thought you could have been a cop?
[02:48:03.147 --> 02:48:14.309]  Well see, my dad and mom were big into history, and so my dad would tell me when I was young, you know, the government brings in the drugs, here's the biggest Brzezinski's book where he admits it, and when you're old enough, read it.
[02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:21.051]  And I mean, and I just thought everybody knew this stuff, and then there were the police dealing drugs, just like my dad said, and then I've had Serpico on.
[02:48:21.051 --> 02:48:22.651]  What do you think about his story?
[02:48:22.651 --> 02:48:25.871]  You know, the police shot him in the face.
[02:48:25.871 --> 02:48:27.732]  Yeah, I mean... Because he didn't want to deal drugs?
[02:48:29.338 --> 02:48:34.001]  I mean, he said the entire New York narcotics department and we're all dealing drugs.
[02:48:34.001 --> 02:48:34.341]  Wow.
[02:48:34.341 --> 02:48:35.501]  I said, what percentage?
[02:48:35.501 --> 02:48:35.882]  He said 100%.
[02:48:35.882 --> 02:48:37.723]  Wow.
[02:48:37.723 --> 02:48:39.404]  Everyone he knew.
[02:48:39.404 --> 02:48:41.345]  And then he was even letting them deal the drugs.
[02:48:41.345 --> 02:48:45.087]  He just said, and they still tried to kill him.
[02:48:45.087 --> 02:48:46.207]  Crazy.
[02:48:46.207 --> 02:48:47.288]  Absolutely crazy.
[02:48:47.288 --> 02:48:48.008]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:48:48.008 --> 02:48:48.769]  Thank you, Julio.
[02:48:48.769 --> 02:48:50.369]  Let's go to another caller here.
[02:48:50.369 --> 02:48:51.370]  Jacob in Missouri.
[02:48:51.370 --> 02:48:52.751]  Go ahead, you're on the air with Rick Ross.
[02:48:53.769 --> 02:48:54.789]  Yeah, how you guys doing?
[02:48:54.789 --> 02:48:59.651]  I just got a quick question for each one of you, if you can just bear with me real quick.
[02:48:59.651 --> 02:49:02.712]  I don't use this word at all, but this is an epic, epic interview.
[02:49:02.712 --> 02:49:06.313]  This is a workout interview right here.
[02:49:06.313 --> 02:49:19.656]  But real quick, Mr. Ross, I literally did a fist pump when I heard you say that you're getting ready to do something with Professor Griff.
[02:49:19.656 --> 02:49:20.837]  I have four brothers.
[02:49:22.478 --> 02:49:25.199]  A couple of us, we're so much alike, we don't get along.
[02:49:25.199 --> 02:49:33.262]  A couple of us, we don't see eye-to-eye on everything, but we have to drop our differences.
[02:49:33.262 --> 02:49:38.824]  What comes next is my question to you, and then I have a question for Alex, too.
[02:49:38.824 --> 02:49:40.665]  What's next?
[02:49:40.665 --> 02:49:46.767]  Can you just get with people like Immoral Technique, KRS-One, and just combine?
[02:49:46.767 --> 02:49:48.568]  Everybody needs to organize and get together.
[02:49:49.805 --> 02:49:52.666]  I agree, but Professor Griffiths wanted to work with me, but I've gotten too busy.
[02:49:52.666 --> 02:50:03.492]  We need to get in the system's face, because they want to control music, and say, we know you're doing it, here's the master plan, here's how you lay it out, and people don't put up with these gangbangers anymore.
[02:50:03.492 --> 02:50:07.113]  They're nothing but soldiers of the New World Order to destroy our communities.
[02:50:07.113 --> 02:50:09.455]  People need to laugh at these gangbangers, not make them heroes.
[02:50:09.455 --> 02:50:10.035]  That's my point.
[02:50:10.035 --> 02:50:10.215]  Sorry.
[02:50:10.535 --> 02:50:12.537]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[02:50:12.537 --> 02:50:14.418]  We definitely got to do that, hit him right in the face.
[02:50:14.418 --> 02:50:18.762]  And like I said before, what Alex is doing right now, you know, most people won't even talk to me.
[02:50:18.762 --> 02:50:22.885]  They don't want to sit down and debate with me what happened in my life and what I went through.
[02:50:22.885 --> 02:50:27.608]  What they want to do is just say, oh, you're no good two-bit drug dealer.
[02:50:27.608 --> 02:50:29.350]  You should have stayed in prison for the rest of your life.
[02:50:29.350 --> 02:50:31.612]  You know, you shouldn't even be out of prison.
[02:50:31.612 --> 02:50:32.973]  They don't want to look at the facts, you know.
[02:50:33.593 --> 02:50:36.736]  Well, why I didn't learn how to read till I was 28 years old?
[02:50:36.736 --> 02:50:38.217]  Why was the school pushing me through?
[02:50:38.217 --> 02:50:40.879]  And these are the issues that need to be dealt with.
[02:50:40.879 --> 02:50:45.323]  You know, why are there 600,000 black men, just black men?
[02:50:45.323 --> 02:50:52.268]  And why this country has 2.2 million people in prison right now, and I think like 50-something million on paper.
[02:50:52.268 --> 02:50:54.010]  It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:54.010 --> 02:50:55.911]  Final segment, let me do some overdrive.
[02:50:55.911 --> 02:50:57.973]  With the real Rick Ross, I'm Alex Jones.

[02:51:32.367 --> 02:51:34.168]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:34.168 --> 02:51:35.809]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:35.809 --> 02:51:38.629]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:38.629 --> 02:51:40.930]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:40.930 --> 02:51:45.432]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:02.281]  I love a dark house.
[02:52:02.281 --> 02:52:04.742]  Inside is all the stuff you work so hard for.
[02:52:04.742 --> 02:52:07.083]  And I'm gonna rob you blind.
[02:52:07.083 --> 02:52:09.184]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:52:09.184 --> 02:52:17.807]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV and makes your home unappealing to would-be thieves.
[02:52:17.807 --> 02:52:19.188]  Don't these people ever leave?
[02:52:19.188 --> 02:52:22.289]  Starting at $24.95 and there's free shipping.
[02:52:22.289 --> 02:52:26.791]  Go to Faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store.
[02:52:26.791 --> 02:52:29.252]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[02:52:30.772 --> 02:52:31.753]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:52:31.753 --> 02:52:35.214]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:52:35.214 --> 02:52:36.874]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:52:36.874 --> 02:52:38.835]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:52:38.835 --> 02:52:44.676]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:52:44.676 --> 02:52:45.497]  I know, right?
[02:52:45.497 --> 02:52:46.817]  You love it, too!
[02:52:46.817 --> 02:52:48.258]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:52:48.258 --> 02:52:49.278]  Let's go get some!
[02:52:49.278 --> 02:52:51.018]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[02:52:51.018 --> 02:52:51.358]  That's 877-886-3653.

[02:53:00.509 --> 02:53:05.874]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[02:53:05.874 --> 02:53:09.737]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[02:53:09.737 --> 02:53:14.882]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[02:53:14.882 --> 02:53:16.784]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[02:53:16.784 --> 02:53:20.247]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[02:53:20.247 --> 02:53:23.130]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:53:23.790 --> 02:53:29.777]  After consuming One World Away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:53:29.777 --> 02:53:36.805]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:53:36.805 --> 02:53:39.188]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[02:53:39.868 --> 02:53:43.672]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[02:53:43.672 --> 02:53:44.613]  Wow!
[02:53:44.613 --> 02:53:45.094]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:45.094 --> 02:53:45.294]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:45.294 --> 02:53:46.775]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:46.775 --> 02:53:47.556]  That's OneWorld.
[02:53:47.556 --> 02:53:47.796]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:54:06.889 --> 02:54:07.590]  We're back, folks.
[02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:10.693]  We're going to do a little bit of overdrive so we can get to more of your phone calls.
[02:54:10.693 --> 02:54:15.257]  Stephen, James, Mike, Mark, and others.
[02:54:15.257 --> 02:54:20.201]  But before we go any further, some really good Twitter questions are coming in.
[02:54:20.201 --> 02:54:23.765]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:54:23.765 --> 02:54:25.566]  I forgot that had a liner.
[02:54:25.566 --> 02:54:26.427]  It is Alex Jones.
[02:54:26.427 --> 02:54:28.089]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:54:28.089 --> 02:54:29.310]  So many good questions here.
[02:54:32.318 --> 02:54:35.140]  Here's a question that I want to get to.
[02:54:35.140 --> 02:54:39.542]  Have you ever reached out to big artists about de-glorifying drug dealing, i.e.
[02:54:39.542 --> 02:54:41.143]  Jay-Z, etc.?
[02:54:41.143 --> 02:54:43.145]  And if so, what was their reaction?
[02:54:43.145 --> 02:54:50.369]  Well, I tried to reach out to everybody in hip-hop about us coming together and changing this culture and so forth.
[02:54:50.369 --> 02:54:52.210]  Nobody would touch me.
[02:54:52.210 --> 02:55:00.415]  Did have a meeting with Dr. Dre and brought up the subject and I was cut off.
[02:55:00.415 --> 02:55:01.076]  Really?
[02:55:01.076 --> 02:55:01.236]  Yeah.
[02:55:02.645 --> 02:55:05.566]  So right now I'm out on my own.
[02:55:05.566 --> 02:55:13.067]  So the man, people know, you talk about this, you push this poison culture, or the big boys aren't going to put you on the radio.
[02:55:13.067 --> 02:55:14.387]  Oh absolutely not.
[02:55:14.387 --> 02:55:15.287]  They're not going to touch me.
[02:55:15.287 --> 02:55:17.968]  You start doing the things that I'm doing.
[02:55:17.968 --> 02:55:21.648]  You know, I have to sell my t-shirts, and I bought you one of my shirts too.
[02:55:21.648 --> 02:55:22.708]  Thank you sir.
[02:55:22.708 --> 02:55:26.529]  I have to sell my t-shirts and my books to pay my way around the country.
[02:55:26.529 --> 02:55:27.369]  Good looking shirt.
[02:55:27.369 --> 02:55:28.049]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:55:28.049 --> 02:55:31.350]  How do folks book you to come speak to their college, their church, or their high school?
[02:55:31.690 --> 02:55:42.337]  They can get me on Instagram or Twitter or my website, RickRossBooks.com, Freeway Rick website, and they can book me there.
[02:55:42.337 --> 02:55:43.217]  I'm going to wear this shirt.
[02:55:43.217 --> 02:55:44.218]  I hope it's an extra large.
[02:55:44.218 --> 02:55:44.558]  It is.
[02:55:44.558 --> 02:55:45.239]  It's an extra large.
[02:55:45.239 --> 02:55:45.999]  I told you I was big.
[02:55:45.999 --> 02:55:49.001]  Okay, the real Rick Ross is not a rapper.
[02:55:49.001 --> 02:55:51.863]  I tell you, I'm going to wear this shirt.
[02:55:51.863 --> 02:55:52.863]  And it's a nice shirt, too.
[02:55:52.863 --> 02:55:53.884]  You feel the quality?
[02:55:53.884 --> 02:55:54.925]  I love that fabric.
[02:55:54.925 --> 02:55:59.287]  Yeah, I used some nice cotton because I know we like nice things, so I hooked it up.
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:03.681]  I think it's important that we send a message to all these guys.
[02:56:03.681 --> 02:56:06.462]  You know, everybody who's promoting this drug culture.
[02:56:06.462 --> 02:56:10.743]  I like the fact that Mark Dice, one of our contributors, he really goes after Rick Ross.
[02:56:10.743 --> 02:56:11.243]  I love Mark.
[02:56:11.243 --> 02:56:12.544]  I love Mark.
[02:56:12.544 --> 02:56:13.124]  He's awesome.
[02:56:13.124 --> 02:56:13.784]  You know who he is.
[02:56:13.784 --> 02:56:14.004]  Good, good.
[02:56:14.004 --> 02:56:15.124]  Yeah, I know who Mark is.
[02:56:15.124 --> 02:56:16.205]  Mark is wonderful.
[02:56:16.205 --> 02:56:23.227]  You know, he hits me up on Twitter and Instagram and we talk about the whole Nine Yards and he went in on the rapper for what he did, you know, and what he's doing.
[02:56:25.006 --> 02:56:26.387]  And I think more people should.
[02:56:26.387 --> 02:56:31.992]  He stole your identity to sell kids on going to prison.
[02:56:31.992 --> 02:56:33.973]  That's got to make you mad.
[02:56:33.973 --> 02:56:34.334]  It should.
[02:56:34.334 --> 02:56:35.475]  It should make everybody mad.
[02:56:35.475 --> 02:56:42.941]  And not only mad at him, but mad at the radio stations, mad at the Universal and Warner Brothers.
[02:56:42.941 --> 02:56:47.725]  I don't think adults know what's in this music.
[02:56:47.725 --> 02:56:48.886]  Let me ask you another question here.
[02:56:51.479 --> 02:56:51.779]  I don't know.
[02:56:51.779 --> 02:56:54.940]  I mean, you know, I was still in prison when all that happened.
[02:57:15.771 --> 02:57:17.272]  Maybe you're the guy to reach out to the family.
[02:57:17.272 --> 02:57:18.913]  Have you talked to them since the movie premiere?
[02:57:18.913 --> 02:57:20.273]  I spoke to... No, not since.
[02:57:20.273 --> 02:57:22.194]  I spoke to the wife at a length.
[02:57:22.194 --> 02:57:23.475]  You know, we talked for about 15 minutes.
[02:57:23.475 --> 02:57:28.577]  Because it was the first time that we had time to sit and talk outside of prison.
[02:57:28.577 --> 02:57:31.839]  When I was in prison, I spoke on the phone.
[02:57:31.839 --> 02:57:32.539]  So maybe I should.
[02:57:32.539 --> 02:57:33.880]  I got her phone number now.
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:37.702]  So maybe I'll reach out to her and ask her if we can get those notes.
[02:57:37.702 --> 02:57:41.484]  Well, he had a whole book written, and he sent me a disk, but it got lost and everything.
[02:57:41.484 --> 02:57:43.465]  Would you be willing to help do that?
[02:57:44.895 --> 02:57:49.178]  Listen, last time I talked to Gary, I was busy.
[02:57:49.178 --> 02:57:50.799]  I said, man, everybody knows the government deals drugs.
[02:57:50.799 --> 02:57:51.539]  I've had you on the show.
[02:57:51.539 --> 02:57:52.640]  I want to get you on again.
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:54.061]  He's like, no, not till my book's out.
[02:57:54.061 --> 02:57:55.221]  And then he called back a month later.
[02:57:55.221 --> 02:57:56.502]  He goes, listen, I gave you all those documents.
[02:57:56.502 --> 02:57:57.282]  Put them up on the site.
[02:57:57.282 --> 02:58:00.564]  I need somebody to put this stuff on an internet site.
[02:58:00.564 --> 02:58:03.526]  And I was like, OK.
[02:58:03.526 --> 02:58:05.487]  And then he was like, he didn't really cuss a lot.
[02:58:05.487 --> 02:58:06.067]  He's like, damn it.
[02:58:06.067 --> 02:58:08.009]  When you're ready to do something about this, you give me a call.
[02:58:08.009 --> 02:58:08.329]  Bang.
[02:58:08.959 --> 02:58:11.202]  I'm sure somebody probably got those notes now.
[02:58:11.202 --> 02:58:13.604]  I'd be surprised if his wife still has that stuff.
[02:58:13.604 --> 02:58:14.565]  But he was passionate.
[02:58:14.565 --> 02:58:16.748]  I mean, he was telling me, you need to, you need to get up.
[02:58:16.748 --> 02:58:17.489]  Oh, without a doubt.
[02:58:17.489 --> 02:58:22.234]  I mean, Gary was, he was willing to, I mean, Gary told me before that people have died for going down this road.
[02:58:22.234 --> 02:58:28.882]  You know, I mean, he's like, hey, Rick, when you go down this street here, you know, like I know going down the drug street, selling drugs, you could get killed.
[02:58:29.801 --> 02:58:35.503]  Well, Gary told me that there's been people that went down the same road that he was going down that gotten killed.
[02:58:35.503 --> 02:58:36.603]  He told me that.
[02:58:36.603 --> 02:58:40.085]  People like Gary Webb are true modern-day heroes, and so are you.
[02:58:40.085 --> 02:58:41.925]  You are redeemed.
[02:58:41.925 --> 02:58:42.546]  I know that.
[02:58:42.546 --> 02:58:43.626]  I can feel it in my heart.
[02:58:43.626 --> 02:58:45.367]  We're gonna come back with some overdriving calls.
[02:58:45.367 --> 02:58:47.687]  For real, Rick Ross.
[02:58:47.687 --> 02:58:49.008]  FreewayRick.com.
[02:58:51.212 --> 02:58:53.833]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:53.833 --> 02:58:55.313]  Check it out today.
[02:58:55.313 --> 02:59:01.074]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none.
[02:59:01.074 --> 02:59:03.695]  And that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:03.695 --> 02:59:11.277]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:59:11.457 --> 02:59:13.939]  Or because they're not 100% organic?
[02:59:13.939 --> 02:59:20.546]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com?
[02:59:20.546 --> 02:59:31.456]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe,
[02:59:31.616 --> 02:59:32.937]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:12.322 --> 03:00:13.865]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:13.865 --> 03:00:16.229]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:00:16.229 --> 03:00:21.417]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:21.417 --> 03:00:25.084]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:26.863 --> 03:00:28.484]  Well, I wish I could go for three more hours.
[03:00:28.484 --> 03:00:29.684]  This is a powerful interview.
[03:00:29.684 --> 03:00:31.906]  We're going to do a taped interview from the Nightly News.
[03:00:31.906 --> 03:00:32.766]  It'll air down the road.
[03:00:32.766 --> 03:00:35.627]  We're going to go through some more of your Twitter questions that are still coming in.
[03:00:35.627 --> 03:00:38.469]  Maybe we'll air it tonight, but I don't want to put it all out at once.
[03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:39.730]  I want to dole it out.
[03:00:39.730 --> 03:00:45.112]  We're going to follow him up to this high school where he's going to be speaking and get some footage of that.
[03:00:45.112 --> 03:00:47.073]  So that should be powerful.
[03:00:47.073 --> 03:00:48.354]  Right now, Steve in Florida.
[03:00:48.354 --> 03:00:49.775]  You're on the air with a real Rick Ross.
[03:00:49.775 --> 03:00:50.095]  Go ahead.
[03:00:51.781 --> 03:00:54.022]  Yeah, good afternoon Alex and Ricky.
[03:00:54.022 --> 03:01:06.946]  Hey, what I wanted to ask Ricky is this, in all your travels and contacts and such through everything you've been through, and if he's not out you could probably enlighten him on this, are you aware of the bigger picture
[03:01:08.371 --> 03:01:18.235]  As far as Operation Paperclip and the whole eugenics agenda, the pharmaceutical industry sounding, and Margaret Sanger wanted to eradicate the world.
[03:01:18.235 --> 03:01:28.018]  Sure, are you aware that the Nazi plan actually came from the US and England, and so that's why so much of this is going on, the secret testing, the drugs, is that it's an attack?
[03:01:28.018 --> 03:01:29.178]  No, I didn't know that.
[03:01:29.178 --> 03:01:30.419]  I'm totally, uh...
[03:01:31.308 --> 03:01:36.390]  Well, I'll give you a film called Endgame that I produced that just goes over their whole master plan.
[03:01:36.390 --> 03:01:38.410]  The truth is we're living in a science fiction movie.
[03:01:38.410 --> 03:01:39.451]  Good to hear from you, Stephen.
[03:01:39.451 --> 03:01:41.411]  Let's talk to James in Michigan.
[03:01:41.411 --> 03:01:44.112]  You're on the air with Rick Ross.
[03:01:44.112 --> 03:01:44.773]  Hey, Rick.
[03:01:44.773 --> 03:01:47.073]  I was just wondering, I have a question for you.
[03:01:47.073 --> 03:01:54.336]  I want to preface by saying, you know, the mafia, they would tell their members not to deal in that junk.
[03:01:55.194 --> 03:02:02.360]  But they themselves, through the French connection of one instance, were dealing it themselves.
[03:02:02.360 --> 03:02:08.225]  My question to you is, had you ever been shaken down by the mob for making as much money as you did?
[03:02:08.225 --> 03:02:12.088]  Because they always want a cut.
[03:02:12.088 --> 03:02:13.369]  No, I wasn't.
[03:02:13.369 --> 03:02:17.072]  That's because they obviously knew that you were a CIA condo.
[03:02:17.072 --> 03:02:18.733]  The little mob doesn't mess with the real mob.
[03:02:18.733 --> 03:02:19.594]  No, they don't.
[03:02:19.594 --> 03:02:21.195]  I mean, I shouldn't speak for you.
[03:02:21.195 --> 03:02:22.236]  Why do you think they left you alone?
[03:02:24.798 --> 03:02:29.481]  It's obviously I had ties that was too big, even for them, you know.
[03:02:29.481 --> 03:02:35.984]  And I probably got rich so fast that, you know, if you wasn't inside, you really didn't know what I was doing, you know.
[03:02:35.984 --> 03:02:37.545]  Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[03:02:37.545 --> 03:02:40.267]  All these fake rappers say, run around and show your wealth off.
[03:02:40.267 --> 03:02:42.688]  You're going to get arrested in 10 minutes acting like that.
[03:02:42.688 --> 03:02:43.289]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:02:43.289 --> 03:02:49.012]  I mean, real drug dealers, folks, real mob chiefs and people are living in small houses and gated communities, keeping their head down.
[03:02:49.732 --> 03:02:52.214]  Yeah, nobody, if you didn't know me, you didn't know I was rich.
[03:02:52.214 --> 03:02:55.896]  I mean, my family, they started to know, and they didn't know how rich I was.
[03:02:55.896 --> 03:03:02.099]  They knew I was wealthy, that when they called me for rent money and repossession money to get their car back, that I could do that.
[03:03:02.099 --> 03:03:07.342]  But they didn't know that I was making, you know, three million dollars a day and how much drugs I was selling.
[03:03:07.342 --> 03:03:08.543]  They didn't understand that.
[03:03:08.543 --> 03:03:14.607]  So the general public didn't know, Blandon knew, but everybody else didn't really know.
[03:03:14.607 --> 03:03:18.309]  And I love how they came back to burn you later, just to tie up loose ends.
[03:03:20.157 --> 03:03:26.621]  That was really crazy to me, you know, how they would take the guy that was supplying all the drugs, you know.
[03:03:26.621 --> 03:03:28.482]  Michael said it in the movie.
[03:03:28.482 --> 03:03:36.086]  I mean, it was one of the parts that I really liked about my character is that Danilo was Santa Claus and I was an elf.
[03:03:36.086 --> 03:03:39.728]  Exactly.
[03:03:39.728 --> 03:03:40.749]  Exactly.
[03:03:40.749 --> 03:03:41.989]  So, oh boy.
[03:03:41.989 --> 03:03:42.710]  Thank you, caller.
[03:03:42.710 --> 03:03:43.510]  Great question.
[03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:44.791]  Mike in Texas, go ahead.
[03:03:46.621 --> 03:03:48.463]  Hey, you're probably here from my Yankee accent.
[03:03:48.463 --> 03:03:56.472]  I'm from the Northeast, but I actually left that area about five years ago to come down here to get away from a lot of the drug culture.
[03:03:56.472 --> 03:04:00.397]  So for everybody who's listening to this, if you think that this is
[03:04:01.589 --> 03:04:14.496]  Everybody who is of Caucasian descent, if you're listening to this and you think this is just a black issue, and I don't have to worry about this because this is just, you know, some African-American and his past problems, no.
[03:04:14.496 --> 03:04:15.977]  This is in your neighborhood.
[03:04:15.977 --> 03:04:19.278]  I grew up in one of the wealthiest communities in New Jersey.
[03:04:19.278 --> 03:04:20.159]  This is too powerful.
[03:04:20.159 --> 03:04:21.700]  We're gonna do more Overdrive.
[03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:23.301]  Network, can you do that?
[03:04:23.301 --> 03:04:23.901]  One more segment?
[03:04:25.299 --> 03:04:28.560]  We're going to do one more segment and then I'm going to have to have you come back.
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:30.240]  We're going to... I don't want to work you too hard.
[03:04:30.240 --> 03:04:31.100]  You ready to do 10 more minutes?
[03:04:31.100 --> 03:04:31.921]  Yeah, we'll do 10 more minutes.
[03:04:31.921 --> 03:04:33.621]  Alright, I'm going to let you get some lunch here.
[03:04:33.621 --> 03:04:35.242]  I know you haven't eaten since breakfast.
[03:04:35.242 --> 03:04:35.902]  Stay there, caller.
[03:04:35.902 --> 03:04:37.842]  I'm going to come back to Mike in Texas.
[03:04:37.842 --> 03:04:44.584]  Listen, one reason I didn't like the cops dealing the drugs where I grew up was that I had beautiful girlfriends that got on drugs and got ruined.
[03:04:44.584 --> 03:04:48.005]  I had buddies I played football with, you know, that were, you know...
[03:04:49.186 --> 03:04:51.912]  Super handsome, great friends, had great lives.
[03:04:51.912 --> 03:04:53.315]  Preacher's sons, you name it.
[03:04:53.315 --> 03:04:55.419]  Lives ruined on drugs.
[03:04:55.419 --> 03:04:59.107]  And yeah, and they were as white as Santa Claus's butt.
[03:04:59.107 --> 03:04:59.708]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:02.045 --> 03:05:03.286]  You pick up the receiver.
[03:05:03.286 --> 03:05:10.051]  With your heart racing and sweat dripping from your forehead, you finally muster the courage to dial the number to call into your favorite talk radio show.
[03:05:10.051 --> 03:05:13.554]  It rings once, twice, and then... Hello, it's GTN.
[03:05:13.554 --> 03:05:15.235]  What's your name and the state you're calling from?
[03:05:15.235 --> 03:05:18.678]  Surprised you got through, you squeak out... Jason from Minnesota?
[03:05:18.678 --> 03:05:19.278]  Please hold.
[03:05:19.278 --> 03:05:26.204]  As you patiently wait for your turn, you begin to daydream about being a famous talk radio host and what it would be like to have your own show.
[03:05:26.584 --> 03:05:28.346]  Jason from Minnesota, you're up!
[03:05:28.346 --> 03:05:32.171]  Millions of loyal listeners worldwide, waiting to call and talk to you.
[03:05:32.171 --> 03:05:33.392]  What color are you there?
[03:05:33.392 --> 03:05:36.115]  Cheering crowds surround you, calling out your name.
[03:05:36.115 --> 03:05:36.636]  Jason!
[03:05:36.636 --> 03:05:37.297]  Jason!
[03:05:37.297 --> 03:05:38.818]  Jason!
[03:05:38.818 --> 03:05:40.520]  Going once, twice.
[03:05:40.520 --> 03:05:42.383]  Okay, we gotta move on to the next caller.
[03:05:42.383 --> 03:05:43.424]  You blew it.
[03:05:43.424 --> 03:05:43.744]  Huh?
[03:05:43.744 --> 03:05:44.025]  Wait.

[03:06:01.372 --> 03:06:08.514]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[03:06:08.514 --> 03:06:10.874]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[03:06:10.874 --> 03:06:16.135]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[03:06:16.135 --> 03:06:21.316]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[03:06:21.316 --> 03:06:24.357]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[03:06:24.637 --> 03:06:28.699]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[03:06:28.699 --> 03:06:33.001]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[03:06:33.001 --> 03:06:43.265]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.

[03:08:11.187 --> 03:08:17.253]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[03:08:17.253 --> 03:08:22.258]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[03:08:22.258 --> 03:08:27.123]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[03:08:27.123 --> 03:08:29.105]  It's not about food.
[03:08:29.105 --> 03:08:31.688]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[03:08:38.348 --> 03:08:40.510]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:40.510 --> 03:08:43.512]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:08:57.281 --> 03:09:02.523]  By the way, Rick Ross will be speaking at Brave New Books tonight, down on Guadalupe Street.
[03:09:02.523 --> 03:09:04.143]  It's Collective Status.
[03:09:04.143 --> 03:09:05.083]  Oh, Collective Status.
[03:09:05.083 --> 03:09:06.524]  See, I was misunderstanding earlier.
[03:09:06.524 --> 03:09:07.404]  That's when I said Brave New.
[03:09:07.404 --> 03:09:08.964]  Okay, where are you going to be speaking tonight?
[03:09:08.964 --> 03:09:13.426]  I'll be at Creative Status, 516 East 6th Street, Austin, Texas.
[03:09:18.140 --> 03:09:18.721]  Okay, great.
[03:09:18.721 --> 03:09:19.701]  And what time is that going to be?
[03:09:19.701 --> 03:09:21.683]  Like 7 to 8.30 or so?
[03:09:21.683 --> 03:09:22.664]  Yeah, well, 6.
[03:09:22.664 --> 03:09:23.705]  I'm going to get there at 6.
[03:09:23.705 --> 03:09:25.247]  I'll get there at 6 to 8.30.
[03:09:25.247 --> 03:09:27.208]  Well, that's fantastic.
[03:09:27.208 --> 03:09:29.230]  And again, plug it one more time.
[03:09:29.230 --> 03:09:35.276]  It's Creative Status, 516 East 6th Street, Austin, Texas.
[03:09:35.276 --> 03:09:37.318]  Alright, Creative Status tonight.
[03:09:37.318 --> 03:09:38.098]  And that should be interesting.
[03:09:38.098 --> 03:09:40.000]  Hell, I'll send a film crew down there with you.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:40.581]  That's awesome.
[03:09:40.581 --> 03:09:41.502]  Yeah, let's do that.
[03:09:41.502 --> 03:09:42.663]  Send a crew down there.
[03:09:42.663 --> 03:09:43.604]  We'll film it and everything.
[03:09:44.324 --> 03:09:45.445]  He's here in studio with us.
[03:09:45.445 --> 03:09:48.366]  We're doing overdrive so that you get a chance to talk to him.
[03:09:48.366 --> 03:09:49.987]  Mike, Mark, Dean.
[03:09:49.987 --> 03:09:51.688]  We've got some more Twitter questions.
[03:09:51.688 --> 03:09:55.110]  His website is IAmTheRealRickRoss.com.
[03:09:55.110 --> 03:09:57.151]  FreewayRick.com.
[03:09:57.151 --> 03:09:59.992]  And let's go ahead now and go back to Mike.
[03:09:59.992 --> 03:10:03.534]  Mike, tell your story about moving down here to get away from the drug culture.
[03:10:03.534 --> 03:10:05.315]  I've got friends from like upstate New York.
[03:10:06.380 --> 03:10:07.901]  They moved down here a decade ago?
[03:10:07.901 --> 03:10:18.506]  They said they moved down here as well because upstate New York, all the farmers and stuff are basically dead and now it's just empty shopping malls and everybody's on drugs basically.
[03:10:18.506 --> 03:10:19.487]  Is that what you're talking about?
[03:10:20.538 --> 03:10:21.578]  It is, yeah.
[03:10:21.578 --> 03:10:22.719]  It's funny you say that, Alex.
[03:10:22.719 --> 03:10:25.799]  I was going to mention a good friend of mine that moved here from Kentucky.
[03:10:25.799 --> 03:10:41.824]  You know, we're in the telecom industry, but his whole family were farmers, and they can't raise—farmers or coal miners—they can't make a living anymore because of all of the so-called, you know, green laws that have been put in.
[03:10:41.824 --> 03:10:47.405]  And now everybody's, you know, a meth dealer there, or grows pot.
[03:10:48.701 --> 03:10:59.644]  The sick thing about my situation is I have in-laws, actually ex-in-laws, who were in the police department in New York City.
[03:10:59.644 --> 03:11:07.166]  And they were at a very high level and always worked with drug enforcement agents whenever big busts were going to take place.
[03:11:07.166 --> 03:11:16.468]  Well, all of these guys that were, you know, my family members, in-laws, who were in the police department had these beautiful, like, mansion-style houses.
[03:11:16.468 --> 03:11:17.148]  And I would say,
[03:11:17.890 --> 03:11:25.412]  You know, to my wife, my ex-wife now, I would say, I know what your brother makes, and there's no way that he can live that way.
[03:11:25.412 --> 03:11:42.137]  And she said, well, they make overtime, and, you know, so after years and years, I mean, I'm 50 now, this started when I was in my 30s, I would say, look, there's absolutely no way that this guy can pull down the kind of money he's making on a salary, even with
[03:11:42.797 --> 03:11:44.358]  Over time, there's nothing wrong.
[03:11:44.358 --> 03:11:49.940]  Well, we had cousins from my family die from drug overdoses, and I would openly say it.
[03:11:49.940 --> 03:11:51.941]  Family parties and holidays.
[03:11:51.941 --> 03:11:55.083]  To this guy, I would say, you know, the main kingpin in the family.
[03:11:55.083 --> 03:12:01.106]  How do you look at yourself knowing that you work with these people that bring this stuff into the country?
[03:12:01.106 --> 03:12:03.847]  And it's not just in the poor black neighborhoods.
[03:12:04.287 --> 03:12:07.949]  Oh, it's the rich neighborhoods, black or white or hispanic.
[03:12:07.949 --> 03:12:09.970]  It's worse there because people got money.
[03:12:09.970 --> 03:12:11.411]  That's where the drug dealing is going on.
[03:12:11.411 --> 03:12:13.152]  The cops never raid those houses.
[03:12:13.152 --> 03:12:25.579]  Now that's the problem is that in those houses they don't get search warrants so easy, but in the black community they can go into a judge and say, hey, I saw this guy selling drugs and I saw this happening and then the cops just come in and raid your house.
[03:12:25.579 --> 03:12:28.861]  But everybody knows that whites use more drugs than blacks.
[03:12:28.861 --> 03:12:31.722]  I know people that work at the fanciest hotel in Austin.
[03:12:31.722 --> 03:12:32.403]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:12:33.188 --> 03:12:35.049]  The one with the President's Station.
[03:12:35.049 --> 03:12:44.412]  In fact, I shouldn't even get into this, because the point is, is that they'll catch people with drugs, and they just, the cops throw it in the trash can, just because that place doesn't want to have a rep.
[03:12:44.412 --> 03:12:46.272]  I mean, that's how controlled stuff is.
[03:12:46.272 --> 03:12:46.973]  Yeah.
[03:12:46.973 --> 03:12:49.613]  And the Austin Police Department is one of the better ones in the country.
[03:12:49.613 --> 03:12:53.155]  I mean, they're not involved in a lot of corruption compared to other departments that we've looked at.
[03:12:53.155 --> 03:12:54.515]  Because I've really looked into it.
[03:12:54.515 --> 03:12:55.115]  Yeah.
[03:12:55.115 --> 03:12:58.316]  But still, yeah, the rich areas just get left alone, basically.
[03:12:58.316 --> 03:12:59.477]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:12:59.477 --> 03:13:00.217]  And don't go to prison.
[03:13:00.777 --> 03:13:04.839]  No, we're not saying that it's not in the white communities, because it absolutely is.
[03:13:04.839 --> 03:13:09.501]  But the blacks, when it comes to prison time and in the court system, that's what you're going to see in court.
[03:13:09.501 --> 03:13:10.262]  Well, I've seen the statistics.
[03:13:10.262 --> 03:13:13.743]  I think a black person for drug crimes on average gets five times the sentence.
[03:13:13.743 --> 03:13:14.904]  Yeah, they do.
[03:13:14.904 --> 03:13:16.404]  It's the exact same crime.
[03:13:16.404 --> 03:13:18.145]  What are those judges thinking?
[03:13:18.145 --> 03:13:21.707]  I mean, they must be really racist.
[03:13:21.707 --> 03:13:24.308]  I mean, you know, when somebody comes in there that don't look like you.
[03:13:24.308 --> 03:13:29.511]  And remember, with this hip-hop culture, black men have been criminalized.
[03:13:30.307 --> 03:13:33.511]  I mean, when you see a black guy, the first thing you do is hit the lock on your door.
[03:13:33.511 --> 03:13:34.632]  You know, oh, this is tough.
[03:13:34.632 --> 03:13:36.515]  Well, black folks say they do that.
[03:13:36.515 --> 03:13:37.576]  Absolutely!
[03:13:37.576 --> 03:13:40.940]  Because this has been planted in everybody's mind that we're criminals.
[03:13:40.940 --> 03:13:43.203]  I mean, look at all our heroes.
[03:13:43.203 --> 03:13:44.584]  Jay-Z.
[03:13:44.584 --> 03:13:45.285]  Rick Ross.
[03:13:45.285 --> 03:13:46.046]  50 Cent.
[03:13:48.382 --> 03:13:52.163]  All of these guys are talking about the crime, criminal culture.
[03:13:52.163 --> 03:13:55.664]  And Dr. Dre, you brought this, you got a meeting with him, you said you got cut off.
[03:13:55.664 --> 03:13:56.565]  What happened?
[03:13:56.565 --> 03:14:02.807]  Well, I started to talk to him about what was happening in Compton and that we need to do some things in Compton that would uplift our community.
[03:14:02.807 --> 03:14:06.428]  You know, that there's no job development centers in Compton.
[03:14:06.428 --> 03:14:08.609]  That nobody is helping these people.
[03:14:08.609 --> 03:14:10.749]  No, that you can make it other ways.
[03:14:10.749 --> 03:14:14.271]  Like, these kids believe that Dr. Dre was a thug.
[03:14:14.271 --> 03:14:15.391]  Dr. Dre is not a thug.
[03:14:16.363 --> 03:14:19.306]  He wasn't around when I was coming up.
[03:14:19.306 --> 03:14:21.808]  So our kids don't understand that.
[03:14:21.808 --> 03:14:25.172]  They don't understand that he used turntables to get rich.
[03:14:25.172 --> 03:14:29.376]  They think that he sold drugs and then took that money and turned it into music.
[03:14:29.376 --> 03:14:30.136]  And that's not what happened.
[03:14:30.136 --> 03:14:30.717]  And what did he say?
[03:14:30.717 --> 03:14:32.339]  How did he cut you off?
[03:14:32.339 --> 03:14:34.300]  He told me he didn't know that this stuff was happening out there.
[03:14:35.089 --> 03:14:37.450]  And I was like, how could you not?
[03:14:37.450 --> 03:14:41.812]  So he just denies it when he knows full well it's that persona that's selling the records.
[03:14:41.812 --> 03:14:42.452]  Absolutely.
[03:14:42.452 --> 03:14:48.574]  And that he could use that now and go in and tell them a good message and he doesn't want to do that.
[03:14:48.574 --> 03:14:48.654]  No.
[03:14:48.654 --> 03:14:57.158]  Because he wouldn't sound hard and cool and, you know, be in all these Dr. Pepper commercials or whatever if he wasn't up there going, I'm hard and I'm this and that, I'm Dr. Grey!
[03:14:58.237 --> 03:14:59.438]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:14:59.438 --> 03:15:03.501]  And I think that... Hell, Chrysler wouldn't let him have the gray system in the 300s.
[03:15:03.501 --> 03:15:04.422]  If he wasn't a gangster.
[03:15:04.422 --> 03:15:05.283]  If he wasn't hard.
[03:15:05.283 --> 03:15:08.325]  Let me tell you what's hard is fighting the New World Order.
[03:15:08.325 --> 03:15:10.607]  What's hard is getting people not to abort their babies.
[03:15:10.607 --> 03:15:13.409]  What's hard is telling the truth and going up against the system.
[03:15:13.409 --> 03:15:15.751]  Not acting like you're a thug.
[03:15:15.751 --> 03:15:16.732]  Makes me sick.
[03:15:16.732 --> 03:15:18.113]  And going along with the system.
[03:15:18.113 --> 03:15:19.374]  Yeah.
[03:15:19.374 --> 03:15:20.835]  A real thug wouldn't go with the system.
[03:15:22.247 --> 03:15:25.067]  Makes me want to throw up, I tell you right now.
[03:15:25.067 --> 03:15:27.648]  Mike, great story, thanks for sharing it.
[03:15:27.648 --> 03:15:28.828]  Yeah, I just hate drugs.
[03:15:28.828 --> 03:15:44.671]  Well, listen, Rob Dew was in a store, one of them, I think it was Rob Dew told me about it, I saw the report they did, and they have a, who's the meth dealer, Breaking Bad, number one show for a while, I never really watched it, and they had a meth, he's a meth dealer toy for kids, and he has meth in his suitcase.
[03:15:44.671 --> 03:15:50.352]  So the kids go and buy it, and then, you know, they go out and imagine they're a meth dealer.
[03:15:50.352 --> 03:15:50.612]  Wow.
[03:15:51.405 --> 03:15:54.086]  I heard about the show, but I wouldn't watch it.
[03:15:54.086 --> 03:15:58.828]  I'm like... I wouldn't either, because I knew, and of course, it made meth get even more popular.
[03:15:58.828 --> 03:15:59.908]  Absolutely!
[03:15:59.908 --> 03:16:07.871]  You know, they show a guy that breaks bad, and everybody accepts it, and he gets... I think that show got so many awards that it was crazy.
[03:16:07.871 --> 03:16:11.393]  But, that's the same thing that happened with me with Superfly.
[03:16:11.393 --> 03:16:19.076]  I see a guy that, just like me, who's down on his luck, and things are not going well for him, and cocaine makes everything right for him.
[03:16:19.961 --> 03:16:20.802]  Unbelievable.
[03:16:20.802 --> 03:16:22.564]  We're going to get that lunch here in just a minute.
[03:16:22.564 --> 03:16:23.845]  We're almost over.
[03:16:23.845 --> 03:16:24.565]  Mark in Texas.
[03:16:24.565 --> 03:16:25.326]  Got to move quick.
[03:16:25.326 --> 03:16:26.527]  Former cop.
[03:16:26.527 --> 03:16:27.328]  Go ahead.
[03:16:27.328 --> 03:16:32.853]  It's an honor speaking to both of you guys.
[03:16:32.853 --> 03:16:35.716]  I was a technical officer at PD&BJ.
[03:16:35.716 --> 03:16:37.017]  And I'll tell you this.
[03:16:37.017 --> 03:16:45.505]  I found there was, among a lot of the inmates, there was more honor than among the officers, either officers in the street or officers in the prison.
[03:16:46.405 --> 03:16:57.831]  I, uh, you know, and, um, I understand now, as far as the CIA goes, why Jeff Case said he wanted to break the CIA into a thousand pieces, and it's probably reflecting his life, too.
[03:16:57.831 --> 03:17:02.594]  I saw that movie with, uh, uh, Kill the Messenger, and it almost made me cry, man.
[03:17:02.594 --> 03:17:06.656]  I, I, I have to keep from crying, knowing that it's going on.
[03:17:06.656 --> 03:17:10.858]  It's like, the government we have actually, is actually carrying these things out.
[03:17:11.568 --> 03:17:14.332]  And I heard about this morning back in the 80s.
[03:17:14.332 --> 03:17:15.513]  I didn't want to believe it.
[03:17:15.513 --> 03:17:16.494]  I didn't believe it.
[03:17:16.494 --> 03:17:21.380]  I didn't think something this evil could be going on, but unfortunately it is.
[03:17:21.380 --> 03:17:23.062]  And it's up to us to get together.
[03:17:23.062 --> 03:17:27.668]  It has nothing to do with black, white, Hispanic, brown.
[03:17:27.668 --> 03:17:30.271]  It's us versus them.
[03:17:30.271 --> 03:17:30.972]  The good people
[03:17:32.661 --> 03:17:44.151]  We gotta explain to young people, when the kids tell you to use drugs and it's cool, you gotta understand it's all a trap to legalize slavery and put you in a hole.
[03:17:44.151 --> 03:17:47.414]  Don't use illegal drugs ever.
[03:17:47.414 --> 03:17:48.074]  For no reason.
[03:17:48.074 --> 03:17:49.636]  Winning is staying out of the system.
[03:17:50.620 --> 03:17:54.167]  And the government is so criminal now, hey, if you don't do it, make your own decision.
[03:17:54.167 --> 03:17:58.797]  You don't want to pay taxes, you want to be successful, you want to do stuff, you know, whatever, that's your issue.
[03:17:58.797 --> 03:18:01.302]  It is time to withdraw our support from the system.
[03:18:02.068 --> 03:18:04.169]  I'm not advising folks to be, you know, do that.
[03:18:04.169 --> 03:18:05.489]  Just do what you gotta do.
[03:18:05.489 --> 03:18:12.831]  But there are ways to really be counter to this evil culture, where you can actually be a rebel.
[03:18:12.831 --> 03:18:15.992]  Don't be the fake rebel they tell you to be, is what I'm getting at.
[03:18:15.992 --> 03:18:16.672]  Right.
[03:18:16.672 --> 03:18:17.812]  The false rebel.
[03:18:17.812 --> 03:18:20.493]  Where you think you're a rebel, but you're really playing right into the system.
[03:18:20.493 --> 03:18:20.933]  Exactly.
[03:18:20.933 --> 03:18:26.495]  The system's telling you to be this false rebel, wear a hip-hop uniform, so the cops have been trained to go after you.
[03:18:27.284 --> 03:18:27.825]  Yeah.
[03:18:27.825 --> 03:18:29.027]  You're almost turning yourself in.
[03:18:29.027 --> 03:18:33.794]  You know, when I look back at it, I almost turned myself into a slave.
[03:18:33.794 --> 03:18:34.836]  That's what I did.
[03:18:34.836 --> 03:18:35.637]  Turned myself into a slave.
[03:18:35.637 --> 03:18:36.198]  Free at last.
[03:18:36.198 --> 03:18:36.819]  Free at last.
[03:18:36.819 --> 03:18:38.461]  Thank God Almighty, we're free at last.
[03:18:38.461 --> 03:18:39.162]  Thank you, Mark.
[03:18:39.162 --> 03:18:39.743]  Last caller.
[03:18:39.743 --> 03:18:40.605]  Got about a minute.
[03:18:40.605 --> 03:18:41.546]  Dean in Colorado.
[03:18:41.546 --> 03:18:41.967]  Go ahead.
[03:18:43.072 --> 03:18:44.754]  Yeah, real quick.
[03:18:44.754 --> 03:18:53.963]  I just wanted to ask Rick if he had thought about following Rick Ross across the country when he's having concert dates set up outside the venues.
[03:18:53.963 --> 03:19:00.949]  We could make a documentary about you or somebody could do it where we follow you around where you're trying to get your identity back.
[03:19:00.949 --> 03:19:02.111]  I'm telling you'd be a huge hit.
[03:19:02.651 --> 03:19:03.451]  I want to do that.
[03:19:03.451 --> 03:19:04.452]  OK, let's do it.
[03:19:04.452 --> 03:19:09.895]  Well, you know, my main thing has just been finances, you know, just trying to... We can do it, but I'd want to hire a cinnamon talk.
[03:19:09.895 --> 03:19:17.239]  We got a great crew here, but I'm telling you, a movie like that, Rick, like trying to get your identity back from a guy that stole your identity.
[03:19:17.239 --> 03:19:17.579]  Right.
[03:19:17.579 --> 03:19:18.900]  And say you couldn't get it in court.
[03:19:18.900 --> 03:19:20.740]  So now you're going to go to the streets.
[03:19:20.740 --> 03:19:22.641]  Oh, that would be dope.
[03:19:22.641 --> 03:19:23.322]  I'm with it.
[03:19:23.322 --> 03:19:24.182]  I just thought of the name.
[03:19:24.182 --> 03:19:25.443]  I'm not going to say it on air.
[03:19:25.443 --> 03:19:25.823]  Let's do it.
[03:19:31.014 --> 03:19:33.275]  Oh, Dean, that's a great last caller.
[03:19:33.275 --> 03:19:33.815]  That was mad.
[03:19:33.815 --> 03:19:34.095]  Thank you.
[03:19:34.095 --> 03:19:34.676]  Thank you, Dean.
[03:19:34.676 --> 03:19:35.256]  Here's my problem.
[03:19:35.256 --> 03:19:36.176]  I get these ideas all the time.
[03:19:36.176 --> 03:19:37.597]  They're always successful.
[03:19:37.597 --> 03:19:38.977]  Problem is, I got to do it, though.
[03:19:38.977 --> 03:19:40.478]  And the problem is, I try to do too much.
[03:19:40.478 --> 03:19:41.898]  Too many irons in the fire.
[03:19:41.898 --> 03:19:44.179]  But, hey, let's get you some lunch.
[03:19:44.179 --> 03:19:45.540]  Let's do another interview.
[03:19:45.540 --> 03:19:48.861]  And then you want to speak to some high schoolers tomorrow, and you're going to come back.
[03:19:48.861 --> 03:19:49.862]  Maybe Friday, come back down.
[03:19:49.862 --> 03:19:50.242]  We'll hang out.
[03:19:50.842 --> 03:19:51.323]  All right.
[03:19:51.323 --> 03:19:51.943]  Thanks.
[03:19:51.943 --> 03:19:52.203]  All right.
[03:19:52.203 --> 03:19:52.964]  Thanks, everybody.
[03:19:52.964 --> 03:19:54.325]  I enjoyed the show.
[03:19:54.325 --> 03:19:54.926]  All right.
[03:19:54.926 --> 03:19:56.427]  Austin, Texas.
[03:19:56.427 --> 03:19:56.908]  You bet.
[03:19:56.908 --> 03:19:58.289]  The real Rick Ross.
[03:19:58.289 --> 03:20:00.391]  I'm the real RickRoss.com.
[03:20:00.391 --> 03:20:00.832]  Stay with us.
