[00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.233]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:25.955]  It is Tuesday, January 21st, 2014, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:48.246]  Well, following an influential think tank's call for a humanitarian real politics stunt to be pulled in order to weaken President Assad's position, well, miraculously, a report has emerged just 24 hours before the Geneva 2 conference, which alleges to show systematic torture and abuse by the Assad regime.
[00:00:48.866 --> 00:01:03.011]  If you have 11,000 bodies dealt with in a systematic way, then you can reasonably infer that this is a pattern of behaviour which has to have higher authority.
[00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.371]  That was Jeffrey Nice.
[00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:17.157]  He was on the legal team that inspected the authenticity of this report, which includes 55,000 digital images alleged to show evidence of 11,000 Syrian detainees tortured, starved, and executed.
[00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:22.340]  Now, the images were reportedly smuggled out of Syria by a defector named Caesar.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:32.845]  He was a military police photographer who worked for the government for 13 years, and his job was to photograph bodies of detainees that were believed to have died under torture.
[00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:38.460]  Now, some are saying that the images are proof of abuse by the Assad regime.
[00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:50.975]  But the report raises questions, not only considering the timing of the release, but also the fact that the report was commissioned by Qatar, which has been an enthusiastic backer of the opposition rebels since day one.
[00:01:51.636 --> 00:02:10.616]  A spokesman for the Syrian Ministry of Information questioned the report's evidence, telling the BBC it was unclear where the information had come from, or if the photographs were from Syria or from outside Syria, and he added that he was astonished at the figure of 11,000 victims, saying that it had not been raised before this report.
[00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:16.540]  This report also arrives just days after the results of an MIT study were published.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.085]  They concluded that the chemical weapons attack on Ghouta could not possibly have been launched from government-controlled areas.
[00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:32.539]  Now, you'll recall that that whole chemical weapons attack was about to serve as the pretext for going to war with Syria.
[00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:42.704]  We told you the day it happened that it was most likely the chemical weapons were launched by the Western-backed Syrian rebels who are aligned with Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:43.044 --> 00:02:46.826]  And now here, MIT is backing that up with their study.
[00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.567]  They say it's basic math.
[00:02:48.607 --> 00:02:52.730]  You can just see the trajectory that this is where the weapons came from.
[00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:10.259]  And so, here we have a clear political agenda with the release of this Qatar report, but the MIT study is being completely ignored by the mainstream media because it doesn't fit their agenda, which is, once again, the US government trying to gear up and get us
[00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:11.299]  We're good.
[00:03:28.354 --> 00:03:36.760]  And now, while these think tanks are calling for this humanitarian invasion of Syria, they're also calling for an extraordinary crisis here in America.
[00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:46.968]  They said that they needed to regain control over those of us who have become awakened, and they need to regain control over our minds with some extraordinary crisis.
[00:03:47.348 --> 00:03:50.151]  But could FEMA be preparing for a pandemic?
[00:03:50.951 --> 00:04:03.135]  The Federal Emergency Management Agency is looking for contractors to supply 40-yard-sized dumpsters along with experts who can dispose of contaminated biomedical waste during a national emergency.
[00:04:03.635 --> 00:04:16.019]  The request for information appears on the FedBizOpps website and asks for feedback from waste removal industry vendors that can potentially provide either dumpster service and or biomedical waste collection and removal services
[00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:20.822]  During emergency response events within the continental United States.
[00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:30.868]  Now we know that this year's flu season is being hyped up as being really dangerous and deadly and of course that's only fueling this concern that the agency is preparing for a pandemic.
[00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:34.671]  But how are pharmaceutical companies leaving us vulnerable?
[00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:44.670]  It's strange that back in the fall there was one story after another in every country that Big Pharma was finished with antibiotics.
[00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.153]  No more research on new drugs to replace those that bacteria have developed resistance.
[00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:52.675]  And they were going to focus solely on viruses and vaccines.
[00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:57.538]  It was strange enough that they would declare they were no longer even concerned about controlling bacterial infections.
[00:04:57.658 --> 00:05:04.663]  What you may not have noticed is the skyrocketing price and limited availability of doxycycline, a common antibiotic.
[00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:13.987]  Oxycycline is often prescribed in the early stages of exposure to Lyme disease, as a prophylactic for malaria, as a follow-up to dental work, and many other uses.
[00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:18.710]  And a prescription that used to cost $4 to $5 now costs between $160 and $200, if you can find a supply.
[00:05:23.772 --> 00:05:25.954]  There was an abrupt spike in cost about a year ago.
[00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:27.735]  The LA Times reported on it.
[00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:30.738]  Then a couple of months later, the CDC pointed out that there was a shortage.
[00:05:30.978 --> 00:05:36.103]  But after a year, the price is still holding firm at about a 50-fold increase.
[00:05:37.424 --> 00:05:46.191]  If there were a free market, a competitive free market, in generic drugs, companies would enter the market, increase supply to take advantage of the higher price, and the price would go down.
[00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:50.399]  But not in the consolidated cartel of pharmaceuticals.
[00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:55.463]  And it's not a case of restricting generics in order to drive people to new, more expensive drugs.
[00:05:55.703 --> 00:05:58.446]  In this case, they're not interested in providing new antibiotics.
[00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:08.154]  So when a commonly used drug increases 40 to 50 times in a price spike and stays there, the question is, is the pharmaceutical cartel simply price gouging?
[00:06:08.755 --> 00:06:12.257]  Or is this a part of a push to get people to buy more medical insurance?
[00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:22.301]  Or is it something more sinister, like are they removing all antibiotics to intentionally leave the population helpless to a superbug, or to a weaponized bacterial outbreak?
[00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:35.765]  Whatever's behind this, antibiotics have been over-prescribed, they've been misused with livestock, and now we have strains that are created that are drug-resistant, and the response of the pharmaceuticals is to gouge people on price and abandon research.
[00:06:36.465 --> 00:06:43.231]  You need to do your own research into safe and effective alternatives to pharmaceuticals, especially for infections.
[00:06:46.034 --> 00:06:46.634]  Well, the U.S.
[00:06:46.734 --> 00:06:53.761]  Army is considering replacing thousands of troops with robots as it's dealing with sweeping troop cuts.
[00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:05.238]  A senior American officer has said that he's considering shrinking the size of the Army's brigade combat teams by a quarter and replacing the lost troops with robots and remote-controlled vehicles.
[00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:12.264]  Options under discussion include trains of robot vehicles that would follow human drivers in long-supply convoys.
[00:07:12.904 --> 00:07:23.012]  The head of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command said the Army should follow the lead of the Navy in using technology to cut manpower, given the fact that people are the major cost.
[00:07:23.452 --> 00:07:34.360]  So while I'm all for reducing the lives of soldiers lost on the field, replacing them with these autonomous robotic killing machines does not sound like a good alternative.
[00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:38.323]  It's actually quite frightening, and considering the American
[00:07:39.164 --> 00:07:39.284]  Yeah.
[00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:58.081]  Unprecedented employment numbers are being reported.
[00:07:58.702 --> 00:08:02.526]  But it's a little contrary to all the happy talk that's coming out of DC.
[00:08:02.947 --> 00:08:06.491]  According to a Wall Street advisor, the actual unemployment rate is 37.2%.
[00:08:09.575 --> 00:08:12.178]  And he says that the misery index is the worst in 40 years.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:21.907]  Now, this advisor is David John Marotta, who we recently reported he had advised anyone who was worried about an imploding economy to get a gun.
[00:08:22.448 --> 00:08:28.593]  And he said that the government just isn't being honest in how it calculates those out of the workforce or inflation.
[00:08:29.534 --> 00:08:42.142]  The unemployment rate, he says, only describes people who are currently working or looking for work, leaving out the number of people who aren't able to, do not want to, or cannot find a way to work.
[00:08:42.482 --> 00:08:49.587]  Unemployment in its truest definition, meaning the portion of people who do not have any job, is 37.2%.
[00:08:50.688 --> 00:08:54.930]  And of course that is well above the Fed advertised unemployment rate of 6.7%.
[00:08:57.472 --> 00:08:59.353]  But why does the Fed want to underreport?
[00:08:59.593 --> 00:09:10.859]  Well, in addition to not wanting the Obama administration to look like huge failures, it's in order to maintain the PSYOP that everything's fine and they've got it all under control.
[00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:20.757]  Well, stick around because coming up, Jakari Jackson avoids being manhandled by the TSA and instead challenges their authority.
[00:09:21.238 --> 00:09:29.024]  And then we'll follow that up with some submissions from our latest We Will Resist TSA and NSA Tyranny film contest.
[00:09:29.344 --> 00:09:29.805]  Stick around.
[00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:42.845]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.429]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:09:45.749 --> 00:09:55.443]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:09:55.763 --> 00:10:03.969]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.711]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:10:07.152 --> 00:10:11.375]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.

[00:10:52.043 --> 00:11:00.287]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:11:00.467 --> 00:11:05.169]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:11:12.113 --> 00:11:19.196]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:11:19.296 --> 00:11:26.178]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[00:11:50.871 --> 00:11:54.413]  I have had enough of censorship in this country and worldwide.
[00:11:54.873 --> 00:12:02.238]  We were all brought up being taught about authoritarian countries like Nazi Germany or Communist China or Russia where the press is censored.
[00:12:02.818 --> 00:12:12.203]  But I read hundreds of news articles a day and I'm here to tell you the United States is as censored or worse than many authoritarian regimes.
[00:12:12.884 --> 00:12:14.725]  I send my reporters all over the country.
[00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:25.665]  I have been out myself hundreds of times, and in almost every case, whether it's a water treatment plant in California or the Austin-Birchstrom Airport,
[00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:29.317]  The police show up and say, you can't film without a permit.
[00:12:29.757 --> 00:12:31.257]  You can't film without permission.
[00:12:31.977 --> 00:12:34.198]  I've been in DC multiple times.
[00:12:34.738 --> 00:12:36.498]  They do not issue permits for news.
[00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.859]  And the police come and say, you can't film monuments like the Washington Monument.
[00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:45.880]  Give me a break from 500 yards away on a sidewalk, because you've got to get a permit.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.901]  Then you say, well, wait, the city doesn't give permits.
[00:12:50.191 --> 00:12:52.832]  And they say it doesn't matter, we're going to arrest you.
[00:12:53.413 --> 00:12:57.055]  So it's the pure threat of force and the gun, outside of law.
[00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:14.764]  It happened today again, when Jakari Jackson and others went down to the airport to ask the public about the fact that actual Al-Qaeda connected, listed terrorist, Muslim Brotherhood have been brought into the country and get to bypass TSA.
[00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:18.225]  The police came out and said, you gotta have a permit.
[00:13:18.305 --> 00:13:18.945]  Let me explain something.
[00:13:19.245 --> 00:13:25.486]  A permit is if you want to block off a major road in New York for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
[00:13:26.287 --> 00:13:31.408]  A permit is if you want to shoot a commercial or a Hollywood movie on the street.
[00:13:31.868 --> 00:13:35.849]  Cops have to be there, fees have to be paid, officers have to be paid for.
[00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:44.011]  If you as a news gathering organization under precedent, First Amendment, common law, you name it, want to interview people on the sidewalk
[00:13:44.733 --> 00:13:48.636]  Not interfering with the walkways, not interfering with the processing.
[00:13:48.696 --> 00:13:58.262]  If you want to interview people about what's happening at the airport, it's totally, completely protected, and it's been fought in court over and over again.
[00:13:58.682 --> 00:13:58.802]  It's 100%.
[00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.684]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:14:01.064 --> 00:14:05.707]  By executive fiat and pure intimidation, they're violating the First Amendment.
[00:14:05.747 --> 00:14:08.229]  So here is the latest in a long train of abuses.
[00:14:08.929 --> 00:14:14.133]  If we don't have the First Amendment right of the press to do interviews on city streets and sidewalks,
[00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:16.094]  We have no First Amendment.
[00:14:16.534 --> 00:14:18.315]  Here's Jakari Jackson's report.
[00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.817]  Man on the street and the police violating the First Amendment.
[00:14:22.878 --> 00:14:27.561]  But it's okay because they're just following orders and the cop tells him he's a big fan.
[00:14:29.192 --> 00:14:31.874]  We need to not just be angry at this police officer.
[00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:33.815]  We need to demand they follow the First Amendment.
[00:14:34.476 --> 00:14:48.525]  And if the cops in the future do the right thing and allow the First Amendment in clearly protected areas, then we need to back those police officers up with the corrupt cities and bureaucrats that are ordering them to do unconstitutional things.
[00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:51.227]  Because these police are doing this under orders.
[00:14:51.848 --> 00:14:52.988]  And it's easy to blame them.
[00:14:54.031 --> 00:15:05.060]  How about we blame ourselves for letting the system get this corrupt to think that in the land of the free, home of the brave, we have less press freedom than in Russia.
[00:15:05.521 --> 00:15:06.802]  Here's Jakari's report.
[00:15:08.968 --> 00:15:13.472]  Being placed on an airport watch list is something that happens all too often in our country.
[00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:21.618]  But what if you were placed on that watch list not necessarily because of any religious or ethnic affiliation, but because you had affiliations with Al Qaeda?
[00:15:22.018 --> 00:15:23.720]  No, I'm not speaking about the CIA.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:30.685]  The Muslim Brotherhood, which has been deemed a terrorist organization by the Egyptian government, has a free reign through our nation's airports.
[00:15:31.106 --> 00:15:33.688]  What do these God-fearing Americans think about this issue?
[00:15:34.208 --> 00:15:35.909]  Confident with airport security since 9-11?
[00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:37.630]  Absolutely.
[00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:43.393]  We've seen that the Muslim Brotherhood, a group that has links to Al-Qaeda, has been able to bypass security screenings.
[00:15:43.993 --> 00:15:47.496]  Do you think that's okay, that a known terrorist organization can bypass security screenings?
[00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:57.202]  I'll tell you, Miss, that the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that has links to Al-Qaeda, has been able to bypass U.S.
[00:15:57.222 --> 00:16:00.103]  security, actually be waived through our security measures here in the States.
[00:16:00.964 --> 00:16:01.324]  Really?
[00:16:01.664 --> 00:16:02.045]  I didn't know that.
[00:16:03.105 --> 00:16:04.186]  What's your opinion on it?
[00:16:05.043 --> 00:16:17.809]  Well, my opinion is that when we have such stringent security, just like for people like you and myself, I flew recently, and I'm guessing that you went through the TSA checkpoint where you either had to get a body scan or a pat-down or, you know, something along those lines.
[00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:28.875]  So if you, a non-terrorist, have to go through all these stringent measures just to get on an airplane, I find it very unheartening, disheartening that a terrorist group can... It's annoying to go through security.
[00:16:29.195 --> 00:16:34.338]  The way they scrutinized me, I see that it is really... You say they scrutinized you?
[00:16:35.057 --> 00:16:49.782]  I mean in terms of like checking everything because I come with a passport which is an African passport which I look like some Brazzers or Muslim people.
[00:16:49.802 --> 00:16:59.826]  And if anybody who's listening out there, you know, any heads of state or any people in the Justice Department, Defense Department are watching this right now, what would you like to say to them if you're concerned about your security?
[00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:07.875]  I would just wish that they would change the way that they do things and make the everyone go through the same ritual that we all do.
[00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:12.556]  I know you guys are filming right now, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't.
[00:17:12.576 --> 00:17:15.217]  Well, I mean, well, sir, we we film all of our encounters.
[00:17:15.257 --> 00:17:16.858]  If you want to talk to me, I'll be happy to talk to you.
[00:17:17.038 --> 00:17:19.759]  Well, OK, I'm just well, how about you come over here?
[00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:20.179]  What's your name?
[00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:23.418]  Uh, if he doesn't want to identify him.
[00:17:23.538 --> 00:17:24.319]  I'm Sakari Jackson.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:25.641]  I'll talk to you.
[00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:26.261]  Okay, well that's fine.
[00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:26.742]  We can talk.
[00:17:27.142 --> 00:17:31.547]  I'm the airport operations person, and the thing is, you guys are out here filming, and it's a business thing.
[00:17:31.587 --> 00:17:38.415]  Somebody gets hurt, you're not permitted, you haven't proven to us insurance and so forth, and so it becomes a liability for us once I see you guys out here.
[00:17:38.815 --> 00:17:41.417]  Okay, and so that's why I come over asking you guys, hey, what are you doing?
[00:17:41.857 --> 00:17:42.758]  You know, all that good stuff.
[00:17:43.098 --> 00:17:46.501]  Have you guys gone through the process like we've asked you to go through several times before?
[00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:49.903]  I've actually been here with you before asking you if you've done that.
[00:17:50.264 --> 00:17:52.185]  And so you're telling me you're not, you haven't done that.
[00:17:52.445 --> 00:17:53.987]  Well, I'll tell you my situation, sir.
[00:17:54.067 --> 00:17:57.789]  You know, I got a, I got a producer and he says, you know, we want to, we want to shoot something.
[00:17:57.809 --> 00:17:58.410]  We want to shoot it quick.
[00:17:58.912 --> 00:17:59.393]  We're good to go.
[00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:22.375]  And I sent the guy, I sent him an email as soon as I found out that I was coming here informing him of the situation.
[00:18:22.395 --> 00:18:28.182]  You know, I was sure that wouldn't be enough time to get a packet together, so you know, I at least try to do my due diligence and inform him.
[00:18:28.202 --> 00:18:33.568]  Alright, so just to be sure, the First Amendment doesn't apply to an airport.
[00:18:34.212 --> 00:18:34.992]  That's not what I said.
[00:18:35.553 --> 00:18:38.074]  Okay, but, you know, First Amendment's the right of the press.
[00:18:38.114 --> 00:18:38.814]  I'm sure you know that.
[00:18:39.455 --> 00:18:41.656]  So, basically, I mean, where are we at?
[00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:44.997]  So you're asking us to leave, but we still have our First Amendment right.
[00:18:45.218 --> 00:18:45.678]  That's correct.
[00:18:45.998 --> 00:18:51.101]  We'll just call it quits here, and I'll ask you guys to leave unless you have further business with the City of Austin.
[00:18:52.181 --> 00:19:01.646]  Okay, so, just so I'm clear, sir, that because we didn't fill out, you know, a piece of paper to come out here, you're saying basically we can't film this location?
[00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:02.371]  That's correct.
[00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:03.291]  That's exactly what I'm telling you.
[00:19:03.311 --> 00:19:04.492]  Yeah, I really am a big fan, guys.
[00:19:04.912 --> 00:19:08.693]  Alright, we're outside the Austin airport, having been asked to leave by the security here.
[00:19:08.994 --> 00:19:16.356]  It seems that the security force is more concerned about journalists with cameras than they are about the Muslim Brotherhood being waived through TSA checkpoint security.
[00:19:16.396 --> 00:19:26.840]  Now, I want to be very clear with our viewers that when I speak about the Muslim Brotherhood, I'm talking about a specific militant al-Qaeda-linked group that the Egyptian government has deemed to be a terrorist organization.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.901]  I am not speaking about Muslims in general.
[00:19:29.241 --> 00:19:38.069]  So we came here today to educate the people and let them know that the pat-downs and the body scans and all the things that they have to go through are not required for known terrorist groups.
[00:19:38.429 --> 00:19:40.792]  We were encountered by a security agent for the airport.
[00:19:41.152 --> 00:19:43.534]  He told us that, hey, you guys need a permit to film here.
[00:19:43.914 --> 00:19:45.276]  And I tried to meet the guy halfway.
[00:19:45.316 --> 00:19:48.659]  I told him that we had contacted their PIO and at least informed them
[00:19:49.099 --> 00:19:49.520]  We're good to go.
[00:20:14.935 --> 00:20:20.502]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:20:20.723 --> 00:20:27.952]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:20:28.112 --> 00:20:31.356]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:20:31.476 --> 00:20:33.239]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:38.042]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:20:38.142 --> 00:20:40.904]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:20:41.044 --> 00:20:46.848]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:20:47.028 --> 00:20:50.490]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:55.734]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:58.916]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:05.019]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:07.140]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:22:26.718 --> 00:22:37.546]  Well, in an absolute abuse of power, the TSA has threatened a man with putting him on a government list unless he takes down his parody video from YouTube.
[00:22:38.026 --> 00:22:39.748]  That man is Telly Blackwood.
[00:22:39.808 --> 00:22:42.490]  He's the producer of Off the Hook Television.
[00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:49.735]  You may recall he had another one of his videos that ruffled the feathers of Michael Moore, who removed his site from YouTube.
[00:22:50.155 --> 00:22:54.679]  Well, he produced this video for the InfoWars film contest and
[00:22:55.419 --> 00:23:01.407]  The TSA agent called him on the phone to say, explain this video to me.
[00:23:01.887 --> 00:23:03.369]  What's the purpose of this video?
[00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:10.819]  And he was noticeably offended by the video's comparison of the TSA employees to the Nazi Gestapo.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.741]  Telly Blackwood
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:20.125]  That is the most hilarious phone exchange between Mr. Blackwood and the TSA agent.
[00:23:20.885 --> 00:23:22.146]  He really sticks it to him.
[00:23:22.166 --> 00:23:23.367]  You've got to go check that out.
[00:23:23.407 --> 00:23:24.828]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:23:24.888 --> 00:23:26.369]  We have that video there.
[00:23:26.769 --> 00:23:38.558]  But to kick off this random selection of submissions for our latest film contest, here is Off The Hook Television's production called TSA Touched My TNA.
[00:23:41.138 --> 00:23:41.959]  We're good to go.
[00:23:56.338 --> 00:23:57.419]  We're good to go.
[00:24:26.887 --> 00:24:28.208]  We're good to go.
[00:25:01.494 --> 00:25:02.994]  I don't think so.
[00:25:30.191 --> 00:25:35.113]  I don't care if he's in a wheelchair, stand him up!
[00:25:57.412 --> 00:25:58.693]  Hello, I'm Richard Reed.
[00:25:59.173 --> 00:25:59.914]  You can call me Dick.
[00:26:00.474 --> 00:26:03.497]  Are you having trouble finding a job without a diploma or GED?
[00:26:03.957 --> 00:26:05.679]  Are you an unemployed, defrocked priest?
[00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:07.900]  Do you enjoy making children cry?
[00:26:10.442 --> 00:26:13.305]  Have you ever wanted to take an old man's pants off in public?
[00:26:13.885 --> 00:26:16.647]  Or are you simply tired of jobs that require you to think?
[00:26:17.308 --> 00:26:24.914]  If you answered yes to any of those questions, then we here at TSA may have the exciting new career opportunity that you've been waiting for.
[00:26:24.934 --> 00:26:25.654]  Can you sit up?
[00:26:26.315 --> 00:26:26.515]  Sit up.
[00:26:28.012 --> 00:26:29.153]  Slam to the floor.
[00:26:29.573 --> 00:26:31.515]  If you touch my junk, I'm going to have you arrested.
[00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:37.419]  With a base salary of $15 an hour, our employees enjoy perks you won't find anywhere else.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.844]  Naps, half hour long bathroom breaks, and little to no supervision whatsoever.
[00:26:44.565 --> 00:26:49.088]  Plus, all the free water, shampoo, and grandma's applesauce you can handle.
[00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:53.810]  At TSA, we're dedicated to America and Americans.
[00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.891]  And in 10 plus years, we haven't caught a single terrorist.
[00:26:57.971 --> 00:27:01.732]  With a 0% success rate, we have nowhere to go but up.
[00:27:02.232 --> 00:27:03.532]  Help us help you.
[00:27:04.073 --> 00:27:07.893]  Apply online at www.infowars.com today.
[00:27:08.474 --> 00:27:12.475]  TSA, fondling millions of genitals every day.
[00:27:13.255 --> 00:27:13.915]  For your safety,
[00:27:17.338 --> 00:27:18.119]  So, where you headed?
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.360]  Baa!
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.561]  Home for the holidays?
[00:27:20.741 --> 00:27:21.382]  Baa!
[00:27:21.943 --> 00:27:25.126]  Are you carrying anything illegal on your, uh, person?
[00:27:25.306 --> 00:27:26.107]  Baa!
[00:27:26.567 --> 00:27:27.648]  Did you pack your own bags?
[00:27:28.429 --> 00:27:29.089]  Baa!
[00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:30.411]  Are you traveling alone?
[00:27:30.951 --> 00:27:31.432]  Baa!
[00:27:31.952 --> 00:27:33.934]  Okay, let's have a look inside your bag here.
[00:27:34.935 --> 00:27:38.018]  An MP3 player, uh, magazines.
[00:27:39.079 --> 00:27:40.681]  Hmm, is this yours?
[00:27:43.107 --> 00:27:45.007]  What a freak!
[00:27:45.288 --> 00:27:45.888]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:46.308 --> 00:27:46.708]  What's this?
[00:27:47.369 --> 00:27:49.710]  An Alex Jones DVD from Infowars.com.
[00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.371]  Why are you some kind of a terrorist?
[00:27:55.239 --> 00:27:59.141]  Millions of people, from all walks of life, suffer from extreme loneliness.
[00:27:59.662 --> 00:28:02.363]  Desperate for someone, anyone, to listen to them.
[00:28:02.524 --> 00:28:05.345]  And more importantly, to understand them.
[00:28:05.525 --> 00:28:12.290]  That's why we at the National Security Agency have made a sworn promise that no American will ever feel alone again.
[00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.612]  And will always be heard and seen, no matter what.
[00:28:15.732 --> 00:28:22.376]  Whether on your cell phone, your personal computer, or a variety of smart appliances, we'll always be there for you.
[00:28:22.856 --> 00:28:29.799]  Taking in everything you say and do, 24-7, 365 days a year, including holidays.
[00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:35.261]  And even though we may never respond directly, you can be rest assured that we aren't listening.
[00:28:35.782 --> 00:28:37.723]  That's the NSA guarantee!
[00:28:38.983 --> 00:28:41.644]  How you doing today?
[00:28:42.165 --> 00:28:44.646]  We'll ask the questions around here, Mr. Domestic Terrorist.
[00:28:46.486 --> 00:28:46.747]  Hey.
[00:28:47.367 --> 00:28:48.407]  Do you own many guns?
[00:28:48.567 --> 00:28:48.928]  Yes.
[00:28:49.268 --> 00:28:49.928]  Racist.
[00:28:50.348 --> 00:28:51.989]  That is so racist.
[00:28:56.038 --> 00:28:57.299]  What, so I can't go through then?
[00:28:57.839 --> 00:28:58.240]  Oh, no, no.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.422]  We want you to go through.
[00:29:00.442 --> 00:29:04.425]  Yeah, we got an x-ray and a pat-down waiting for you.
[00:29:04.945 --> 00:29:06.566]  Hey, this is against the Fourth Amendment.
[00:29:07.187 --> 00:29:07.607]  No, it isn't.
[00:29:07.968 --> 00:29:10.970]  No, it's not, because Al-Qaeda might be hiding up your butt.
[00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:11.871]  We gotta search.
[00:29:12.491 --> 00:29:14.053]  We gotta search your racist butt.
[00:29:14.113 --> 00:29:15.193]  We gotta search.
[00:29:15.213 --> 00:29:16.755]  It's for your safety, racist.
[00:29:17.315 --> 00:29:21.138]  You're just lucky that we haven't installed our detention pods at this here airport yet.
[00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:25.302]  Or we would capture your racist, Al-Qaeda-hiding, domestic terrorist butt.
[00:29:25.962 --> 00:29:26.984]  Cut down!
[00:29:27.664 --> 00:29:28.225]  Have a nice night.
[00:29:28.405 --> 00:29:28.646]  What?
[00:29:29.106 --> 00:29:29.367]  Hey.
[00:29:30.148 --> 00:29:30.468]  Hey!
