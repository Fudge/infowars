[00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.771]  Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs at the Info Wars Command Center.
[00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:12.712]  We're about to pack up.
[00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:13.673]  We have our gear ready.
[00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.475]  Heading back to Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:16.717]  This is going to be my second tour.
[00:00:16.737 --> 00:00:18.379]  Joe, this is going to be your third.
[00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:18.479]  Yeah.
[00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:21.102]  We've seen a lot of stuff happen in Ferguson.
[00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:25.086]  We expect to hear what's going to happen with the officer in the very near future.
[00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:26.428]  Could be in the next couple of days.
[00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:29.211]  So we plan to have boots on the ground when that happens.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.843]  Yeah, we also got wind that the new Black Panthers are going to be bringing AK-47s.
[00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:43.149]  Now we have reports that the KKK will be threatening to use violence if civil disobedience erupts in Ferguson.
[00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.070]  So it should make for a very interesting time.
[00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.195]  We'll be there documenting it all, wearing our infidel body armor that we've been given to go on this trip with.
[00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:52.255]  So thanks guys for that.
[00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.458]  Other than that though, stay tuned for more reports.
[00:00:55.518 --> 00:00:57.239]  We'll be tweeting out stuff as it happens.
[00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:01.401]  Putting up stuff as well on Instagram and our InfoWars Instagram account.
[00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:05.104]  And look for our videos on YouTube and InfoWars.com.
[00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:06.445]  So stay tuned for more reports.
[00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:09.567]  Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs heading to Ferguson, Missouri.
