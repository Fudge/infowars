[00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:14.075]  Alright, it's Saturday night at 11.57pm.
[00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:19.637]  In three minutes, the curfew will be in effect in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:00:19.657 --> 00:00:21.858]  As you can see, a strong police presence behind me.
[00:00:21.898 --> 00:00:24.539]  We're in the free speech zone as journalists.
[00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.580]  Unfortunately, a lot of people don't have that status.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.061]  Peaceful people out here so far.
[00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:34.762]  The streets are mostly deserted as far as I can see.
[00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:36.663]  There's rumors of people behind buildings.
[00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:37.703]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:00:37.723 --> 00:00:38.724]  We'll find out soon enough.
[00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:41.167]  And let's just see what happens.
[00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:54.120]  This is the police department.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.841]  You are violating state imposed curfew.
[00:01:19.702 --> 00:01:27.123]  You must continue to disperse peacefully or you'll be subject to arrest and or other actions.
[00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:29.824]  You must clear the roadway.
[00:01:29.884 --> 00:01:32.865]  You are violating the state imposed curfew.
[00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:49.857]  You must disperse the area immediately.
[00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:54.799]  You are in violation of the state and political curfew.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.461]  You are subject to arrest in these continued actions.
[00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:02.442]  You must leave immediately.
[00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:04.023]  Oh, here we go.
[00:02:04.043 --> 00:02:04.803]  It's going down.
[00:02:05.464 --> 00:02:07.604]  It's coming right at us.
[00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:08.365]  Watch out.
[00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:08.585]  Yes.
[00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:08.705]  Yes.
[00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:27.588]  You must disperse immediately.
[00:02:28.608 --> 00:02:31.669]  You are in violation of the state imposed curfew.
[00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.532]  Failure to comply peacefully will result in arrest and or other actions.
[00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.941]  No, but I can't breathe!
[00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:52.061]  Ow!
[00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:52.481]  God!
[00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:57.004]  I'm freaking out!
[00:02:59.045 --> 00:02:59.425]  God!
[00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:01.766]  Come on!
[00:03:02.487 --> 00:03:03.487]  I can't sit here!
[00:03:03.507 --> 00:03:03.647]  No!
[00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:03.767]  No!
[00:03:18.983 --> 00:03:21.204]  Oh my god!
[00:03:21.264 --> 00:03:32.408]  Bro, I can't stand up right now.
[00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.751]  Ja'Kari Jackson at Fort Worth's couch pulled his mask off.
[00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:40.072]  It's as real as it gets.
[00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:41.972]  I cannot breathe.
[00:03:43.873 --> 00:03:44.913]  I'm sure I'm dripping snot.
[00:03:45.294 --> 00:03:46.074]  Yo Biggs is out here.
[00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:50.877]  It hit us with freaking tear gas.
[00:03:57.883 --> 00:04:02.428]  I'll have more of them, really.
[00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:19.098]  Full report is here at fullboys.com so I can't do this right now.
[00:05:05.782 --> 00:05:11.885]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:05:11.905 --> 00:05:15.226]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:05:15.246 --> 00:05:16.947]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:23.229]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:29.232]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:33.154]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:36.216]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:44.421]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:46.742]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:47.843]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:56.951]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
