[00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:04.665]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:08.571]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:17.091]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:18.792]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:20.613]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:22.094]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:23.794]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:28.036]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:32.719]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.341]  I'm going to be as calm as I can.
[00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:38.681]  We are live.
[00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:39.582]  It is 11 a.m.
[00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:40.702]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:43.164]  Thursday, the 14th day of August, 2014.
[00:00:45.086 --> 00:01:01.977]  My reporters, Josh Owens, Jakari Jackson, and Joe Biggs, were attacked with tear gas, flashbangs, and rubber bullets last night in Ferguson, Missouri, that has been federalized and is being monitored by the United Nations.
[00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:14.045]  If you understand psychological warfare, it's clear the feds are trying to escalate this as much as they can
[00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:16.860]  To start riots all over the country.
[00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:35.431]  The media is billing this as a citizen against the cops, and that if anybody is against the First Amendment being abandoned, that they are just anti-police, and are pro-thugs with their drawers hanging down over their butts, burning down buildings.
[00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:38.213]  Now that happened back on Sunday.
[00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:42.076]  And Saturday night.
[00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:43.817]  That's not happening now.
[00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:46.697]  Our reporters went in there with an open mind.
[00:01:48.118 --> 00:01:52.179]  Jakari Jackson was going to college for RTF and criminology.
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.682]  His whole family is extremely conservative when it comes to things like the police.
[00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:02.784]  And Jakari has told me that it's just outrageous what's going on.
[00:02:02.844 --> 00:02:11.368]  So has Joe Biggs, who's a combat veteran, multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a war hero, written up in Rolling Stone and Esquire.
[00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:13.774]  So, he went in there with an open mind.
[00:02:13.794 --> 00:02:14.594]  He doesn't hate police.
[00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:16.054]  A lot of his friends are cops.
[00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:22.216]  This is outrageous on so many fronts how they're trying to spin it.
[00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:26.117]  There is video we're going to play here in a moment for TV viewers, for radio listeners.
[00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:28.958]  It's up on InfoWars.com with our own video of it.
[00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.139]  We don't just have the video like Al Jazeera has.
[00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:36.821]  We have the audio of an Al Jazeera crew with big cameras, lights, doing their news report
[00:02:37.932 --> 00:02:40.233]  Being fired at with tear gas and rubber bullets.
[00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:43.796]  You see Jacari behind them, running away in the video.
[00:02:46.757 --> 00:02:50.319]  And then the SWAT team runs up and dismantles.
[00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:53.962]  They fired tear gas at them.
[00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:56.243]  Then as they run, rubber bullets were then fired.
[00:02:56.983 --> 00:02:58.264]  The media doesn't even have that part.
[00:02:58.504 --> 00:02:59.265]  Jacari was there.
[00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:00.486]  Biggs was hit.
[00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.908]  And then they run up and tear the cameras apart.
[00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:20.686]  So, mainline TV crews, folks, who are 500 yards away, or more, are being attacked, and I couldn't tweet last night.
[00:03:21.286 --> 00:03:26.548]  We went and did a test, Kit Daniels did, set up a new Twitter, sent out the Joe Biggs video, the live feed.
[00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:28.529]  They suspended the account.
[00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.530]  Turned it back on in the morning.
[00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.392]  They are wargaming and psy-opping the internet.
[00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:36.313]  And the cops on the ground don't even know this.
[00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.935]  So I'm not the enemy of the police who are being given disinformation.
[00:03:40.882 --> 00:03:42.183]  But it's now been federalized.
[00:03:42.223 --> 00:03:52.912]  The county, the city, state police, and feds, just like Katrina, where they use it for gun confiscation, and people denied that at the time, later confirmed, this is a Psy-Op.
[00:03:53.472 --> 00:03:55.154]  This is a Psy-Op.
[00:03:55.674 --> 00:04:04.121]  Look at the Sheriff's Department, federalized, with men with AR-15s, aiming them at the press after they shoot them with rubber bullets.
[00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:07.264]  This keeps happening.
[00:04:07.864 --> 00:04:09.786]  People are going to start, you know, wanting back.
[00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.230]  And it is going to turn into a civil war.
[00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:20.555]  The police are being told, you know, dominate, maintain control, shut down the press, and, you know, we'll keep this under control.
[00:04:21.075 --> 00:04:23.677]  Well, statistically, this will have the opposite effect.
[00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:26.479]  If we're lucky, this won't blow up.
[00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:39.847]  But the intent by the feds, with the federalization, I mean, people think it's an archetypal image of UC Davis with the head cops spraying kids in handcuffs with gallons of pepper spray.
[00:04:41.172 --> 00:04:41.672]  No, no, no, no.
[00:04:41.993 --> 00:04:50.600]  What's archetypal is paramilitary police shooting reporters with rubber bullets and tear gas, running up and dismantling the camera.
[00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:55.925]  The military attacking the press in America, attacking cameras.
[00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:57.526]  This is the new image.
[00:04:58.547 --> 00:05:02.671]  Make no mistake, artists, you name it, are going to expose this.
[00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:07.335]  And this all integrates with the open borders and the rest of it.
[00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:08.596]  We'll break it down coming up.
[00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:14.110]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:18.232]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:20.013]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:27.916]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:29.037]  But for how long?
[00:05:29.337 --> 00:05:35.580]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.781]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:40.664 --> 00:05:47.549]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.211]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:06:15.432 --> 00:06:21.376]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:31.421]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the Survival Silver Solution, the new InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:36.103]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:06:36.383 --> 00:06:44.747]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:46.888]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:06:47.108 --> 00:06:58.215]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[00:07:10.652 --> 00:07:14.373]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:07:14.493 --> 00:07:15.653]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:07:15.733 --> 00:07:16.834]  God knows what's in there.
[00:07:17.054 --> 00:07:21.135]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:27.077]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:07:27.217 --> 00:07:28.197]  That one is better.
[00:07:28.257 --> 00:07:29.217]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:07:29.517 --> 00:07:30.958]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:07:30.978 --> 00:07:31.458]  It's good water.
[00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:37.323]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:07:37.563 --> 00:07:44.609]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.292]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[00:07:47.512 --> 00:07:55.439]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:56.580]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.581]  It's good water.
[00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:58.241]  Refreshing.
[00:07:58.261 --> 00:07:58.722]  It's good!
[00:07:59.002 --> 00:07:59.982]  You have the power!
[00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:00.903]  Humanity has the power!
[00:08:00.943 --> 00:08:01.903]  We have the power!
[00:08:01.923 --> 00:08:02.983]  Do you want to fight?
[00:08:03.043 --> 00:08:04.664]  You better believe you got one!
[00:08:23.087 --> 00:08:27.530]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.611]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:39.597]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have talked a lot here on the air about the season of crisis.
[00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:48.483]  The time of great turmoil that we're now entering that will only intensify in the days, months, and years to come.
[00:08:49.724 --> 00:08:51.245]  And I'm afraid only become
[00:08:52.296 --> 00:09:03.499]  More insane as the technological quickening towards the technotronic era accelerates towards what the globalists call the singularity.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:15.443]  I want to be scientific today in the breakdown of what's happening in Ferguson, Missouri with the backdrop of the globalist destabilization worldwide.
[00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:22.192]  We know that the summer is the time of rage, historically.
[00:09:22.713 --> 00:09:23.873]  The time of the riot.
[00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:28.235]  We know this country, in most areas, is in a depression.
[00:09:29.555 --> 00:09:31.076]  Especially in the Rust Belt.
[00:09:33.717 --> 00:09:39.359]  We live in an occupied nation run by foreign offshore banks that have levied Obamacare against us.
[00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:43.841]  That attacks every man, woman and child, regardless of race, color or creed.
[00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:51.082]  We know we've been signed on to 1,500 trillion dollars of fake derivatives.
[00:09:52.143 --> 00:09:55.585]  Hundreds of times what the nation could ever pay back and it's not our debt.
[00:09:55.905 --> 00:09:59.127]  We know our government is illegitimate funding Al Qaeda worldwide.
[00:09:59.847 --> 00:10:08.653]  We know the NSA is being used to spy on political enemies and for social control and to corner the stock market and rig the economy to consolidate power.
[00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:28.075]  We know the government has a 7% approval rating in Gallup, a 6% approval rating in Pew Research, the mainstream media has a 13% approval rating on average in Gallup, and a little bit lower in Pew.
[00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:36.783]  The system is a fraud, is illegitimate, and it wants to get Americans fighting with Americans.
[00:10:37.023 --> 00:10:38.004]  Black against white.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.481]  Hispanic against white and black and vice versa.
[00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:43.762]  Man against woman.
[00:10:44.222 --> 00:10:45.163]  Woman against man.
[00:10:45.563 --> 00:10:46.723]  Kids against their parents.
[00:10:46.983 --> 00:10:47.904]  North against South.
[00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:49.324]  East against West.
[00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:54.266]  Farmer against shopkeeper.
[00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:56.587]  Cop against citizen.
[00:10:57.488 --> 00:11:02.470]  Police, it's time to wake up and understand the psyop that's being run here.
[00:11:03.445 --> 00:11:10.007]  If I come out and simply decry what the police are doing, it will fit into the globalist paradigm.
[00:11:10.888 --> 00:11:17.610]  I do decry what they've done, but with the provisos that we understand the larger picture here.
[00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.131]  There is no debate about what's happening.
[00:11:21.752 --> 00:11:25.033]  I've told you the age of the contrived
[00:11:26.308 --> 00:11:34.333]  The orchestrated, but also the allowed and exacerbated crisis is now here.
[00:11:35.354 --> 00:11:36.975]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:11:37.275 --> 00:11:40.537]  Rahm Emanuel to the Wall Street Journal five years ago.
[00:11:42.838 --> 00:11:48.962]  Do I think they went and shot this innocent black guy with his hands up in front of a bunch of people to start this whole thing going?
[00:11:49.482 --> 00:11:50.103]  Probably not.
[00:11:51.087 --> 00:12:06.676]  But are the feds coming in with their training over the years and now federalizing this operation and escalating it to try to make the crisis worse and to try to set the precedent of martial law in this country just like they did with the Boston bombing?
[00:12:08.317 --> 00:12:11.039]  Searching half the houses in the city without warrants?
[00:12:11.599 --> 00:12:14.962]  Throwing men, women, and children around who look nothing like the suspect?
[00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:17.183]  Absolutely.
[00:12:18.695 --> 00:12:35.068]  The militarization of police, the MRAPs, the helicopters, the military training, the illegal surveillance, the threat fusion centers, dialed in to illegal NSA tracking, all of this is the twisting and the corruption and the federalization of our police.
[00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:47.298]  It is the seduction of them into their new mission, which I told you would be used against Muslims first, because they were the most unpopular group,
[00:12:48.103 --> 00:13:05.255]  Then against blacks, then against Hispanics, and then the main enemy, gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians, conservatives, Christians, anti-abortion activists, and white people.
[00:13:06.836 --> 00:13:14.461]  You notice now they're segwaying into the war on whites while they then set precedence on a mainly black neighborhood.
[00:13:15.387 --> 00:13:19.968]  Manipulating underlying white racism that does exist in some quarters.
[00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:25.089]  I see the comments on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and on YouTube.
[00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:26.029]  A lot of them are bots.
[00:13:26.489 --> 00:13:28.750]  We're able to track them on InfoWars and know they're artificial.
[00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.970]  But some of them are real.
[00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.550]  Saying, why are you out there helping monkeys?
[00:13:34.131 --> 00:13:36.291]  Why are you out there with the N-words?
[00:13:38.372 --> 00:13:39.852]  Well, number one, those are human beings.
[00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:42.567]  Number two, this is a larger PSYOP.
[00:13:43.308 --> 00:13:54.520]  Number three, what is allowed to be done against what is seen as the least of us, will then be done against all of us, as Christ said.
[00:13:56.682 --> 00:13:58.404]  What you do to the children, you do to me.
[00:13:58.684 --> 00:14:00.206]  What you do to the poor, you do to me.
[00:14:00.566 --> 00:14:01.487]  What you do to groups,
[00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:06.298]  They have a bunch of, you know, gangbangers out of the, you know, bad areas of St.
[00:14:06.338 --> 00:14:09.060]  Louis saying, let's go riot because they shot this black guy.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:15.425]  They go into some semi-rural area, mainly with a bunch of old black retirees out there that have worked their butts off their whole lives.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:27.268]  And then they sit there and burn down a few buildings, and then we send reporters there to find out what's really going on, and I was getting criticism for saying, well, people are burning stuff, the police have got to maintain order.
[00:14:27.929 --> 00:14:34.434]  Then the feds show up and say, attack reporters, and start tear-gassing and rubber-bulleting reporters, and I say that's wrong.
[00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:38.037]  I'd say it was wrong if they were black, or if they were white, or if they were blue!
[00:14:39.358 --> 00:14:42.041]  Let me tell you, Biggs is blue from those rubber bullets now.
[00:14:44.107 --> 00:14:45.429]  Because I stand for justice.
[00:14:45.709 --> 00:14:46.710]  I stand for what's right.
[00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.353]  Because that's what makes me feel good in my gut.
[00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:53.077]  When I do wrong, I feel bad.
[00:14:53.298 --> 00:14:55.620]  When I do the right thing and tell the truth, I feel good.
[00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:57.142]  I feel right with God.
[00:14:58.283 --> 00:15:02.648]  When I start even thinking about doing something wrong, that fear of God creeps in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.911]  And that's why this country's so screwed up.
[00:15:07.568 --> 00:15:09.309]  Because people aren't God-fearing.
[00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.591]  And I don't mean you're going to find God in one of these fake churches.
[00:15:12.972 --> 00:15:15.013]  Anybody who's God-fearing knows what I'm talking about.
[00:15:15.033 --> 00:15:18.255]  You want justice.
[00:15:19.036 --> 00:15:20.097]  You want prosperity.
[00:15:20.597 --> 00:15:21.538]  You want to help people.
[00:15:21.758 --> 00:15:22.939]  You want to build things up.
[00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:24.520]  And they use
[00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:29.929]  The ignorance of God-fearing people to support open borders and saying it's for the kids.
[00:15:30.109 --> 00:15:31.950]  That's part of a larger globalist plan.
[00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.050]  That's why I'm against it.
[00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.791]  Not because I'm against those kids fleeing Guatemala.
[00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:38.052]  One of the greatest hell holes on Earth.
[00:15:38.832 --> 00:15:40.553]  They're not bringing them here to save them.
[00:15:40.713 --> 00:15:42.713]  They're bringing them here to bring the country down.
[00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:48.335]  And I've supported the Border Patrol, a constitutional agency, under attack.
[00:15:49.858 --> 00:15:51.598]  When police are in the right, I support them.
[00:15:52.078 --> 00:15:53.419]  When they're in the wrong, I don't.
[00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:57.259]  And I studied this for 22 years, and I know what I'm talking about.
[00:15:57.479 --> 00:16:04.761]  We got Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson, and Josh Owens all there, who got tear-gassed, flash-banged, and shot with rubber bullets.
[00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:18.143]  Biggs got shot with rubber bullets, the others got hit with everything, but that... But the larger system, you gotta pull back if you're a black racist, and I gotta say, stop being a mindless idiot being manipulated by tribalism.
[00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:23.780]  You gotta pull back if you're a white racist and see the larger manipulation and not be a mindless primitive.
[00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:27.743]  You gotta scientifically see the battle space for what it is.
[00:16:28.244 --> 00:16:36.130]  If you're a cop, all hopped up in mob mentality, tired of getting yelled at for three days, because you're telling folks to back off and pointing guns at them.
[00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:47.920]  Think cops, when you point lasers at innocent people with their hands up, 70, 80 meters away, almost 100 yards away, they start yelling at you and getting angry.
[00:16:54.619 --> 00:17:03.683]  When you shoot reporters with tear gas and rubber bullets, like Al Jazeera, and point laser dots on Al Jazeera, you cause the same situation.
[00:17:05.964 --> 00:17:06.645]  That's what I said.
[00:17:06.785 --> 00:17:13.708]  What they're doing, according to... Listen, the military, when they want to stir people up, they send in troops with orders to do stuff like this.
[00:17:14.348 --> 00:17:17.190]  When they want to pacify a population, they do the opposite.
[00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.992]  Joe Biggs did that on three or four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:25.578]  He knows that it's a basic military system.
[00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:36.367]  This is military system to stir people up and start riots all over the country and play the public off against the police and the military to start a civil war.
[00:17:37.321 --> 00:17:50.725]  And to make the poster boy for the Civil War, stupid ghetto rats with their pants hanging down around their ankles, to then shell that image of the police and military crushing them to bring in permanent martial law.
[00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:59.488]  And I've been telling you, the number one way they'll bring in martial law is to get riots stirred up around the country by the illegals and blacks and poor whites and others.
[00:17:59.508 --> 00:18:03.429]  I'm going to skip the network break, this is so important, and go to our reporters.
[00:18:06.314 --> 00:18:11.338]  And then they'll stage terror attacks in the next phase, claiming the Tea Party did it, and go after their political enemies.
[00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:14.041]  They're already censoring us on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:18:14.241 --> 00:18:16.042]  They're already suspending our Twitter accounts.
[00:18:16.443 --> 00:18:18.364]  They're already not letting us put out a lot of tweets.
[00:18:18.665 --> 00:18:19.686]  I couldn't tweet last night.
[00:18:20.626 --> 00:18:24.610]  They're already stopping me sharing video links to Joe Biggs getting shot with rubber bullets.
[00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.173]  And the police announced, we're gonna play this clip in a moment,
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.601]  Turn off your cameras!
[00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:49.291]  Two, literally 15 news trucks we counted, Al Jazeera, Washington Post, New York Times, USA Today, Washington Times, InfoWars.com, I mean there is over a hundred different press groups out there.
[00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:50.232]  Over a hundred.
[00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:58.977]  And more than 15 that were willing to be out there, and our guys were up there about a hundred and something yards away, then they backed off to 500 yards.
[00:18:59.277 --> 00:19:07.686]  I've talked to the reporters, and they, the armored vehicles that we were told were for Al Qaeda, I told you it was for the First Amendment, rolled out.
[00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.230]  Decepticons roll out!
[00:19:12.831 --> 00:19:13.912]  Attack the First Amendment!
[00:19:14.172 --> 00:19:15.033]  Target freedom!
[00:19:17.213 --> 00:19:25.859]  These are supposedly the good guys with flashbangs and rubber bullets and tear gas shot directly at news crews.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:34.185]  And then they chase them down with AR-15s, ladies and gentlemen, shooting people in the back.
[00:19:34.405 --> 00:19:39.268]  I mean, I'm not macho, ladies and gentlemen, but let me just tell you something.
[00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:41.870]  I'm getting to the point that I'm going to throw up.
[00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:44.677]  And cooler heads have got to prevail.
[00:19:44.937 --> 00:19:51.902]  We've got to keep our powder dry and not respond with these police who don't know they're the bait on the hook to start a civil war.
[00:19:52.142 --> 00:19:55.945]  The cops on the ground being ordered by the feds to do this have no idea.
[00:19:56.806 --> 00:19:58.107]  The us against them mentality.
[00:19:58.367 --> 00:20:01.549]  This is a government with a 7% approval rating.
[00:20:03.591 --> 00:20:06.933]  They are more unpopular than Kim Jong-un in US polls.
[00:20:06.953 --> 00:20:10.756]  They've actually done one with Kim Jong-un and he's more popular than this government.
[00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:15.552]  Now, again, I'm going to tell the military and police something.
[00:20:16.233 --> 00:20:30.780]  When they're done waging their war against, you know, poor folks in the ghetto, who will then take advantage of the burning and stuff to loot stuff, that will then be projected onto the press and anyone that doesn't follow orders.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.082]  And then they're going to start censoring the internet even more.
[00:20:35.983 --> 00:20:36.643]  Talk about
[00:20:38.573 --> 00:20:38.873]  Evil.
[00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:54.217]  Tear-gassing, rubber-bulleting, mainline news reporters, arresting Washington Post reporters, Huffington Post reporters, you name it, and then attacking people and attacking their news cameras.
[00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:57.818]  This is a dictatorship.
[00:20:58.298 --> 00:20:59.739]  And Obama, the U.N.
[00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:00.439]  was involved.
[00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:10.279]  NAACP says Michael Brown shooting front and center at the United Nations and the UN says Obama's doing a great job.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.000]  That's right!
[00:21:12.602 --> 00:21:18.909]  And now Obama is about to legalize 30 million illegal aliens and if they give them the order they'll go out and riot.
[00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:34.441]  And then the military will come save us and the precedent is set to see, well, we stopped all the rioting by shutting down your Twitter and your Facebook and attacking even mainstream press and people in military uniforms in McDonald's.
[00:21:35.777 --> 00:21:38.620]  Arresting Washington Post reporters.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:46.828]  We're going to play all these videos and then go to our reporters literally standing in front of signs that have holes in them from rubber bullets right where Biggs was hit.
[00:21:47.428 --> 00:21:49.810]  But first, let's go for radio and TV viewers.
[00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:54.174]  If you're a radio listener, go to Infowars.com forward slash show free video feed.
[00:21:54.775 --> 00:22:00.518]  If you want to see it in higher def and see the subscription nightly news, subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:00.598 --> 00:22:01.278]  It's $5.95 a month.
[00:22:01.658 --> 00:22:04.900]  You get all 11 memberships for $5.95 to share them.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.302]  We have to have PrisonPlanet.tv because they can censor us on YouTube and other places.
[00:22:10.582 --> 00:22:12.883]  By the way, we've not been censored on YouTube yet.
[00:22:13.223 --> 00:22:16.905]  Twitter and Facebook are beginning to censor us and suspended some of our accounts last night.
[00:22:18.317 --> 00:22:20.058]  Only turning them on last night.
[00:22:20.458 --> 00:22:21.098]  I mean, this morning.
[00:22:21.778 --> 00:22:26.900]  I mean, I am just completely freaked out right now because I know how the PSYOP works and we're seeing it happen.
[00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:33.322]  And we see folks on Infowars.com and on our YouTube comments going, why are you anti-police, Alex?
[00:22:33.802 --> 00:22:35.463]  You know, why are you siding with the riots?
[00:22:35.483 --> 00:22:36.303]  You need to be arrested.
[00:22:36.824 --> 00:22:43.446]  We're following the IP addresses back to government servers, back to military bases, back to the Justice Department with bots.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.761]  Because you'll notice on our YouTube videos, we have 98-99% positive votes.
[00:22:53.501 --> 00:22:57.342]  We'll have 3,000 up votes and 25 negative votes.
[00:22:57.382 --> 00:22:59.843]  So, your bots can't vote on YouTube.
[00:23:00.823 --> 00:23:03.504]  But you're there creating the perception that I need to be arrested.
[00:23:03.904 --> 00:23:05.104]  Again, I need to get a report out on this.
[00:23:05.184 --> 00:23:08.445]  I don't have enough reporters to write about all this as it happens in the battle space.
[00:23:09.315 --> 00:23:10.175]  This is happening so fast.
[00:23:10.236 --> 00:23:13.857]  We have government servers posting on InfoWars.
[00:23:14.378 --> 00:23:21.181]  We can't track it on YouTube, but it's the same comments, that I need to be arrested for inciting riots when I'm trying to do things that will stop a riot.
[00:23:21.402 --> 00:23:30.807]  The police, under federal control, are doing things that, according to basic military technology and systems, will cause a group to revolt.
[00:23:34.128 --> 00:23:38.591]  And you got whites out buying guns, mainly, in record records now, and it's spreading across the country.
[00:23:39.935 --> 00:23:42.136]  In fear of Watts riots and all the rest of it again.
[00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:47.318]  You see how this is all orchestrated to get everybody against each other while the globalists loot the treasury?
[00:23:47.978 --> 00:23:50.219]  While the globalists put fluoride in all our children's water?
[00:23:50.619 --> 00:24:01.243]  Let's go to the incredible footage shot by Josh Owens of Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs reporting and you can hear them on the loudspeaker saying, turn off your cameras.
[00:24:02.216 --> 00:24:19.211]  Now remember, California just passed a bill, and it's already in all the new cell phones, to have automatic kill switches when they hit one button, citywide or nationwide, to turn your phone off, and all you can get is Obama government messages, or they can turn your phone on to track you, but nothing else.
[00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:28.439]  This is a government who premeditatedly loaded NSA control systems, just like in your smart meters, which they now admit to control everything you do.
[00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:36.651]  CIA director three years ago told Wired Magazine your washing machine and your dishwasher are listening to you.
[00:24:37.673 --> 00:24:41.319]  All the new dishwashers have microphones by federal law.
[00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:43.342]  Tear them open!
[00:24:44.312 --> 00:24:44.913]  People don't believe me.
[00:24:44.933 --> 00:24:48.196]  In fact, I want to tear open a Scientific Atlantic cable box.
[00:24:48.677 --> 00:24:52.301]  I want to go buy one at the store and tear the damn thing open on TV.
[00:24:52.501 --> 00:24:55.504]  Because that's the only thing that'll wake up the primitives out there.
[00:24:55.524 --> 00:24:57.066]  And I mean black, white, all of you.
[00:24:57.266 --> 00:24:58.607]  You act like a bunch of primitives.
[00:24:59.088 --> 00:25:02.091]  Where you sit there and the enemy openly announces what they're doing.
[00:25:02.411 --> 00:25:02.812]  There it is.
[00:25:02.892 --> 00:25:06.356]  CIA chief will spy on you through your dishwasher.
[00:25:09.721 --> 00:25:14.983]  The Kinects, all of it, Kinects for five years can look through up to 10 walls in your house.
[00:25:15.163 --> 00:25:17.464]  They can look at your neighbors through a Kinect.
[00:25:18.465 --> 00:25:34.392]  They can through vibrations on your window, pick up vibrations on the neighborhood window vibrating and have HD audio of you in bed with your wife off your neighbor's Kinect a thousand yards away with the digital algorithms.
[00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:36.590]  Do you understand?
[00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:41.332]  It's not run by a benevolent, loving government that did all this to help you.
[00:25:41.632 --> 00:26:00.580]  They are putting nanotech cancer viruses in the major vaccines that implant in your DNA and are hormone released, where they can either spray you with a hormone through the food or water to activate the cancer, it's a binary weapon, or it triggers, depending on which system, when you hit age 60.
[00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.591]  You like being murdered?
[00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:06.532]  Oh, the police are here to help us.
[00:26:06.712 --> 00:26:10.174]  The police are compartmentalized and don't know anything like the public.
[00:26:10.915 --> 00:26:12.876]  We know the enemy operation.
[00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:14.597]  We have reverse engineered it.
[00:26:14.877 --> 00:26:18.460]  You ignore what I say at you and your family's total peril.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.622]  You are living in a hardcore science fiction movie.
[00:26:22.162 --> 00:26:26.085]  Everything I just told you is on record if you simply go and look it up.
[00:26:27.674 --> 00:26:45.225]  They're already giving the troops, without asking them, an anti-aggression or anti-depression injection with a live virus that then attacks neurons in areas of the brain associated with higher brain waves, spiritual experiences, love and hate, so you're not upset anymore.
[00:26:45.985 --> 00:26:48.568]  They're already putting brain chips in troops.
[00:26:48.848 --> 00:26:51.511]  They already chipped special forces 20 years ago.
[00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:54.353]  They already started chipping the officers five years ago.
[00:26:54.734 --> 00:26:59.538]  I knew about it from army officers in my family before it was in the news!
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.985]  You're not going to hear that from your whorehouse megachurch here in Austin, Texas.
[00:27:06.365 --> 00:27:08.907]  You're not going to hear it because they're government agents now.
[00:27:09.864 --> 00:27:13.646]  And all you idiots that serve the system, that think you're part of it, we're going to break.
[00:27:13.686 --> 00:27:14.607]  Coming back with our reporters.
[00:27:14.967 --> 00:27:16.188]  You're going to find out soon.
[00:27:16.448 --> 00:27:18.590]  Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson, Josh Owens coming up.
[00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.670]  Let's go to these clips.
[00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:20.451]  Here's the audio.
[00:27:20.571 --> 00:27:23.173]  Please turn off your video.
[00:27:23.193 --> 00:27:24.594]  What did they say?
[00:27:24.614 --> 00:27:26.355]  I think they said please turn off your video.
[00:27:26.375 --> 00:27:28.216]  That's what it sounded like to me.
[00:27:31.147 --> 00:27:33.189]  Did they just tell us to turn off and stop filming?
[00:27:33.589 --> 00:27:34.910]  I think that's what they said, honestly.
[00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.652]  Sounded like this is gonna have a super bomb.
[00:27:37.692 --> 00:27:39.574]  They told us to turn off our recording.
[00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:40.975]  Trapping anybody in?
[00:27:41.015 --> 00:27:42.436]  They tried to.
[00:27:42.516 --> 00:27:44.558]  Front line of the Info War!
[00:27:44.598 --> 00:27:46.940]  Joe Biggs, Takari Jackson, Josh Owen.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.721]  The front line of the Info War.
[00:27:48.761 --> 00:27:50.763]  LRAD sound weapons.
[00:27:51.804 --> 00:27:52.945]  They said it would never be used against us.
[00:27:52.965 --> 00:27:53.865]  It's really hurting my ears, though.
[00:27:54.066 --> 00:27:54.946]  Used against Iraqis.
[00:27:55.066 --> 00:27:56.588]  Oh my God, they're coming at us right now.
[00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:57.488]  They're coming at us right now.
[00:27:57.508 --> 00:27:59.010]  Now, you heard the warring voice.
[00:27:59.250 --> 00:27:59.650]  That's good.
[00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.531]  Come back tomorrow.
[00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:02.973]  Alright, flashbangs going off.
[00:28:03.513 --> 00:28:06.974]  Then they target with rubber bullets and tear gas the crews.
[00:28:07.694 --> 00:28:10.515]  Now this is from Jacari, right in front of him is the Al Jazeera crew.
[00:28:11.455 --> 00:28:12.215]  Doing their job.
[00:28:13.175 --> 00:28:15.075]  During the Watts riots, during the L.A.
[00:28:15.115 --> 00:28:19.276]  riots in the 60s, the Watts riots in the early 90s, the L.A.
[00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:22.136]  riots, they never targeted press.
[00:28:22.237 --> 00:28:23.737]  The police would never think of that.
[00:28:24.177 --> 00:28:25.357]  Under federal orders.
[00:28:26.617 --> 00:28:30.698]  Now this is from the perspective of Josh Owens, Jacari Jackson and Joe Biggs.
[00:28:32.031 --> 00:28:45.618]  Let's now go to the footage shot from across the street of your TV viewer, I'm ascribing it for radio listeners, of a still camera hidden in the bushes, somebody hiding in the bushes getting paramilitary police under federal command with MRAPs that were in Iraq.
[00:28:47.088 --> 00:28:57.170]  Saying back off, you know, leave, and then firing tear gas at the mainstream media, and then going up and firing rubber bullets at them, in an assault on everything.
[00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:04.272]  And by the way, this is to take our bank accounts, pension funds, they're putting this in place because they're going to break the country once and for all.
[00:29:04.292 --> 00:29:08.793]  These cops, their parents, their kids, they will lose everything too.
[00:29:09.953 --> 00:29:13.774]  But they won't care because they'll have a uniform and can strut around in the third world we're going to be.
[00:29:14.715 --> 00:29:16.375]  They won't know because it'll be done over the years.
[00:29:18.598 --> 00:29:22.621]  So understand, the police following the orders, like Katrina, with the military.
[00:29:22.641 --> 00:29:25.604]  In fact, guys, pull up Gun Confiscation Katrina.
[00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:27.546]  It's the NRA video, it's ABC News.
[00:29:27.846 --> 00:29:29.447]  I want to play that later if we talk to the reporters.
[00:29:29.827 --> 00:29:30.848]  So people always deny that.
[00:29:31.129 --> 00:29:45.461]  They went to the high and dry areas, used the poor people in the 8th Ward as the excuse for martial law, went into the high and dry areas 10 miles away, went into $5 million houses, blew open safes, stole all the guns, and handcuffed rich people.
[00:29:46.141 --> 00:29:54.144]  So all you racist white people that are sending us texts saying how dare you side with monkeys and all this other racist crap, you're idiots.
[00:29:54.684 --> 00:29:58.725]  They're going to come in your house and take everything you got and they're going to take you to a FEMA camp.
[00:29:58.885 --> 00:29:59.766]  They're going to rape your wife.
[00:29:59.786 --> 00:30:00.466]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.486 --> 00:30:01.006]  You understand?
[00:30:01.086 --> 00:30:02.006]  The empire is on the run.
[00:30:02.027 --> 00:30:04.567]  They're going to put your kids in an Obama brainwashing brigade.
[00:30:04.587 --> 00:30:06.068]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.088 --> 00:30:08.889]  Your kids are going to turn you in, you stupid racist dumbasses.
[00:30:11.132 --> 00:30:14.953]  InfowarsStore.com from this Monday to next.
[00:30:15.353 --> 00:30:28.536]  All of the incredible books, videos, supplements, liberty-based attire, belt buckles, Molon Labe t-shirts, organic seeds, you name it, are 10% off the already extremely low prices.

[00:30:35.137 --> 00:30:38.798]  And in many of the private schools and the quote higher levels of education.
[00:30:39.078 --> 00:30:42.880]  Infowars.com is right at the tip of the sphere worldwide.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:50.062]  That's why it's essential to take advantage of this 10% off across the board special at infowarsstore.com.

[00:31:00.546 --> 00:31:02.727]  History is taking place right now.

[00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:17.052]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:31:17.252 --> 00:31:21.393]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:26.396]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:31:26.796 --> 00:31:29.418]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:31:29.718 --> 00:31:34.902]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:31:35.162 --> 00:31:42.047]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:31:42.547 --> 00:31:46.309]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.473]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:51.793 --> 00:32:00.215]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:32:00.395 --> 00:32:04.476]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:12.670]  In the near future.
[00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:17.091]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:32:17.451 --> 00:32:18.451]  Security alert.
[00:32:18.691 --> 00:32:20.412]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:32:20.692 --> 00:32:21.312]  Analysis.
[00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:22.212]  InfoWars.
[00:32:22.292 --> 00:32:24.372]  Building independent media operations.
[00:32:24.392 --> 00:32:29.233]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:32:29.273 --> 00:32:30.233]  Prime Directive.
[00:32:30.313 --> 00:32:31.753]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:32:31.853 --> 00:32:34.634]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:32:34.714 --> 00:32:37.774]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:32:37.954 --> 00:32:40.175]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:32:40.235 --> 00:32:40.955]  These people are a
[00:32:41.195 --> 00:32:43.156]  They're never going to stop.
[00:32:43.376 --> 00:32:51.341]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:32:51.481 --> 00:33:04.949]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:07.371]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:33:16.693 --> 00:33:19.997]  Summer of Rage!
[00:33:20.358 --> 00:33:22.580]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:25.524]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:28.367]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.367 --> 00:33:38.729]  Obama is set to give a press conference on Ferguson.
[00:33:39.750 --> 00:34:00.789]  He'll call for unity and peace while all of his pundits working for the Justice Department on MSNBC and CNN will call for crushing any demonstrations while at the same time having other pundits on the same channels calling it police brutality and calling for more riots, basically.
[00:34:02.711 --> 00:34:10.519]  Again, it's full spectrum dominance with reporters being arrested in McDonald's, with people being tear gassed.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:17.706]  You go to Infowars.com, we have a graphic up there with the photo, First Amendment dismantled in Missouri.
[00:34:18.747 --> 00:34:22.351]  But the image of the tear gas and the police coming up,
[00:34:26.886 --> 00:34:35.654]  And dismantling the mainstream television cameras after shooting them with rubber bullets after announcing turn your cameras off.
[00:34:36.775 --> 00:34:41.339]  Now imagine what they're going to do with all the kill switches built into all the phones and different devices now.
[00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:50.047]  They admit they're going to turn them off and Twitter and Facebook and other systems already are testing to not let us spread the information.
[00:34:51.718 --> 00:34:54.161]  That's why everyone has got to keep their old video cameras.
[00:34:54.622 --> 00:34:59.549]  Old tech is going to become very valuable in the future as I've told people for a long time.
[00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:04.756]  Because Trojan horses of social control premeditatedly are being put in everywhere.
[00:35:05.257 --> 00:35:08.361]  Video up on InfoWars.com for radio listeners.
[00:35:09.414 --> 00:35:17.417]  Ferguson Police tell reporters turn off cameras before attacking press with rubber bullets, flashbangs, and tear gas.
[00:35:18.037 --> 00:35:21.898]  Police concerned about flash mob violence based on horror movie.
[00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:23.339]  Shock video.
[00:35:23.399 --> 00:35:26.080]  Ferguson Police deliberately tear gas journalist.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.881]  Ferguson Police AWOL for looting.
[00:35:31.084 --> 00:35:38.505]  Out in force to crush First Amendment arrest journalist, video, Ferguson riot police wound reporter, and attack on protesters.
[00:35:38.765 --> 00:35:41.866]  Yeah, our headlines should have been like the Washington Post when their people got attacked.
[00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:45.607]  InfoWars reporters shot with rubber bullets, attacked.
[00:35:45.927 --> 00:35:56.969]  And we go to the man who was hit by rubber bullets and has big bruises from it, that's former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, who knows about crowd control and talked about yesterday, this is clearly to stir people up.
[00:35:57.998 --> 00:36:04.001]  The Justice Department is there running things, clearly wanting to stir things up like they got caught doing with Trayvon Martin.
[00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:08.944]  So I want to get his breakdown on what happened last night, and then Obama's going to pop in and speak.
[00:36:08.964 --> 00:36:10.304]  We'll cut to him once he starts.
[00:36:10.564 --> 00:36:13.086]  Then we're going to go to Jakari Jackson and others.
[00:36:13.646 --> 00:36:15.367]  Thank you for coming on, Joe Biggs.
[00:36:16.027 --> 00:36:18.008]  You were truly in wartime last night.
[00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:19.749]  I saw you saying that in your report.
[00:36:19.769 --> 00:36:20.830]  You've been in a lot of combat.
[00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.931]  What was it like for you to see this in America?
[00:36:23.894 --> 00:36:26.756]  JoeBiggsInfoWars.com in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:36:27.076 --> 00:36:30.238]  We're actually standing right here where the battle took place last night.
[00:36:30.478 --> 00:36:33.520]  This is literally a war zone or was a war zone last night.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.263]  If you look around, there's a little triangle area right in the middle of the road.
[00:36:37.703 --> 00:36:44.547]  That's where we were standing when you could hear the turn off your cameras, stop recording, and then the vehicles approached us.
[00:36:44.887 --> 00:36:47.149]  Alex, I'm telling you right now, this clearly
[00:36:48.004 --> 00:36:49.225]  Disappoints me to see this.
[00:36:49.285 --> 00:36:53.227]  I mean, I am nauseated at the PSYOP that they used on us.
[00:36:53.247 --> 00:36:57.409]  They are trying to take something and racially divide everybody.
[00:36:57.489 --> 00:36:58.870]  I mean, it was ridiculous.
[00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:03.952]  And then they were targeting journalists, purposely trying to find them and arrest them and take their footage.
[00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:06.914]  It was, I just don't even know what to say.
[00:37:06.954 --> 00:37:11.016]  I mean, this place still smells like tear gas because they gassed this place so bad.
[00:37:11.776 --> 00:37:14.678]  The cloud was for a mile back in either direction you went.
[00:37:15.814 --> 00:37:17.095]  It was just mind-blowing.
[00:37:17.155 --> 00:37:18.515]  Explosions everywhere.
[00:37:18.996 --> 00:37:24.098]  I was running around over here, and when the tear gas came at me, we got lost.
[00:37:24.138 --> 00:37:28.461]  I got separated from Josh and Jakari, and it was just complete and total chaos.
[00:37:28.501 --> 00:37:30.462]  Just... a battle.
[00:37:31.262 --> 00:37:41.127]  And I started running in a direction, and I made a mistake because I actually ran towards the riot police, and as I started going across the parking lot, they shot me right in the side over here.
[00:37:41.147 --> 00:37:44.349]  And if you want, you can kind of see some of the bruise right now.
[00:37:45.745 --> 00:37:47.705]  Pretty tender and sore.
[00:37:48.946 --> 00:38:13.552]  And I was watching the live feeds last night like it was a made-for-TV movie or something at home on Infowars.com over Ustream and other systems and I mean they would literally walk up to you guys from like a hundred yards away and say get out of here get out of here even though you were retreating and just wanted to shoot an American with these rubber bullet shotgun
[00:38:15.362 --> 00:38:16.943]  You were just holding one of them up, Joe.
[00:38:17.223 --> 00:38:18.463]  Show the viewers that again.
[00:38:25.285 --> 00:38:26.986]  Those are the rounds that come out of this.
[00:38:27.026 --> 00:38:28.306]  That's what hit me.
[00:38:28.687 --> 00:38:31.247]  We actually found this right over here in the area where I was shot.
[00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:33.168]  These are very hard...
[00:38:36.542 --> 00:38:37.002]  Rounds.
[00:38:37.182 --> 00:38:39.043]  I mean, it was very painful.
[00:38:39.063 --> 00:38:46.465]  I mean, it took me to my knees and I hit the ground and a bunch of the locals from the neighborhood ran over, grabbed me and helped me up and said, Are you OK?
[00:38:46.765 --> 00:38:49.926]  And as I was able to take in a breath, I got shot with gas again.
[00:38:50.266 --> 00:38:53.387]  And all I breathed in was just a full, fresh hit of gas.
[00:38:53.727 --> 00:38:55.288]  And I was just throwing up, crawling.
[00:38:55.828 --> 00:38:59.509]  And these guys are sitting there beating their shields, yelling, you know, just they're just coming after us.
[00:38:59.969 --> 00:39:02.330]  And, you know, when I looked around, all I could see was smoke around me.
[00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:03.610]  I had no idea where I was.
[00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.631]  It was nuts just to see
[00:39:06.886 --> 00:39:09.727]  America looked like Fallujah, Iraq.
[00:39:10.808 --> 00:39:12.708]  And the people were fine.
[00:39:12.748 --> 00:39:14.609]  People were protesting peacefully.
[00:39:15.129 --> 00:39:20.252]  What incited this entire incident was they decided to bring in MRAPs, snipers.
[00:39:20.472 --> 00:39:23.773]  The snipers were on top of the vehicles, calling out people in the crowd.
[00:39:24.053 --> 00:39:27.835]  They were trying to antagonize the peaceful protesters.
[00:39:27.875 --> 00:39:30.696]  They wanted someone to do something so they could
[00:39:31.434 --> 00:39:33.195]  You know, eventually attack us.
[00:39:33.495 --> 00:39:39.999]  There were cops on the side sitting there holding their batons, twisting it back and forth with a smile on their face, just sick.
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.961]  Tukara kept saying, why are you smiling?
[00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:43.821]  Why are you smiling?
[00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:45.562]  You know, you need to be professional.
[00:39:45.582 --> 00:39:47.423]  And this guy was just ready to hit someone.
[00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:51.085]  I just can't believe that I'm in America right here.
[00:39:51.105 --> 00:39:56.288]  Like this is something I expect in Iraq, Afghanistan, in some third world country, but not in America.
[00:39:56.428 --> 00:39:56.969]  This is just,
[00:39:58.069 --> 00:40:12.033]  Well, from what I know from talking to a lot of Marines and Army people and others, you don't ever want to act like that and turn the locals against you, even if you're fighting an enemy that's amongst them, that this would be the thing tailor-made to turn a foreign population against you.
[00:40:12.293 --> 00:40:16.575]  But this is our own people, traitors really, amongst us doing this.
[00:40:17.235 --> 00:40:23.597]  And so I was hoping that the feds were ordering them to do this, which we know they are, but I didn't know that they were taunting again last night.
[00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:42.211]  Wanting somebody to throw a single bottle, as did get thrown, as a pretext to then set the precedent to attack reporters, just like they set the precedent to put the entire city of Boston under martial law, just like they set the precedent in Katrina to gun confiscate.
[00:40:42.932 --> 00:40:43.993]  This is a plan.
[00:40:44.053 --> 00:40:46.735]  They want war against the American people.
[00:40:47.055 --> 00:40:49.057]  They see us as basically Al Qaeda.
[00:40:49.897 --> 00:40:51.939]  I walked up right to the line, Alex, and I was just
[00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:54.113]  My feet are covered in blisters right now.
[00:40:54.133 --> 00:40:56.534]  I mean, my feet are like, literally, I can just peel off layers of skin.
[00:40:57.475 --> 00:40:59.876]  And I got to a point where I couldn't even stand up anymore yesterday.
[00:40:59.916 --> 00:41:02.457]  I stood, or I sat down right in front of the, uh, MRAP.
[00:41:03.158 --> 00:41:08.180]  And right as I sat down, it might have been a minute, a bottle whizzed right over my head and broke in front of me.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.243]  And I'm sitting there laying on the ground like, oh my God, these guys are about to shoot me, because that dropped right in front of me.
[00:41:13.683 --> 00:41:17.665]  And the next thing you know, a Molotov cocktail got thrown over my right shoulder, basically.
[00:41:18.125 --> 00:41:19.486]  Jakari saw the person that did that.
[00:41:19.546 --> 00:41:21.327]  It hit the top of the car wash over here, if you want to look.
[00:41:22.289 --> 00:41:28.132]  I bet money that was a federal provocateur, because they always do the maul-offs, and we're always catching them.
[00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:37.197]  I mean, what do the police think is going to happen when they end up killing some more people, and then folks don't pull out maul-off cocktails, and the real thing starts up?
[00:41:37.757 --> 00:41:39.058]  Well, there's an article in RT.
[00:41:39.078 --> 00:41:41.659]  They're saying that they are pulling the Ferguson Police Department.
[00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:44.000]  They are not going to be using them anymore.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.701]  They're going to bring in outside forces.
[00:41:45.721 --> 00:41:46.802]  That was in an article today.
[00:41:47.622 --> 00:41:51.244]  Well, I've already seen state police out there, and they say they've been federalized two days ago.
[00:41:53.313 --> 00:41:56.817]  The people I saw last night did not look like regular cops.
[00:41:56.857 --> 00:42:00.863]  I mean, these guys were ex, you know, special forces, things like that.
[00:42:01.103 --> 00:42:03.166]  Big, jacked up guys.
[00:42:03.507 --> 00:42:05.489]  You know, they had the special forces type gear.
[00:42:05.509 --> 00:42:06.310]  I mean, and...
[00:42:08.903 --> 00:42:15.029]  I just can't get that image out of my head, Alex, of that guy just twisting that rod in his hand like he just wanted something to happen.
[00:42:15.389 --> 00:42:18.893]  And that's where the bottle actually busted was right, like, maybe feet from him.
[00:42:19.353 --> 00:42:20.494]  Because people were tired of it.
[00:42:20.534 --> 00:42:23.057]  People kept coming over and saying, hey, why are you doing that?
[00:42:23.097 --> 00:42:24.158]  Get that smile off your face.
[00:42:24.178 --> 00:42:25.059]  You need to be professional.
[00:42:25.539 --> 00:42:26.559]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:36.123]  Well, I mean, also at a fundamental level, it's the armored vehicles, the body armor, the tanks, the aiming the lasers at men, women, and children, the loaded guns.
[00:42:36.663 --> 00:42:37.783]  It's so cowardly.
[00:42:38.223 --> 00:42:42.445]  It'd be like watching an 800-pound gorilla beat up a one-year-old baby.
[00:42:43.305 --> 00:42:44.646]  And then they're smiling about it.
[00:42:44.666 --> 00:42:45.966]  It's just so dishonorable.
[00:42:47.126 --> 00:42:48.807]  It's so cowardly.
[00:42:49.488 --> 00:42:54.352]  I got chased over here, and what happened is you can see a neighborhood back here off in the back.
[00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:57.594]  I got chased out of here, and I had to start hopping fences.
[00:42:57.655 --> 00:43:00.217]  I'm literally running through people's backyards.
[00:43:00.237 --> 00:43:05.281]  There were two young teenagers who helped me out who are from the neighborhood, and they said, hey, you need to get out of here.
[00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:06.281]  They're looking for you guys.
[00:43:06.822 --> 00:43:14.128]  So I started hopping fences, and I'm running through, and I'm right in line with the MRAPs and the militarized police force going down the road.
[00:43:14.528 --> 00:43:17.090]  Jakari was just in front of them, and Josh was off to the left.
[00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:24.148]  And I'm running down through the woods, the side, trying to keep up with everything, and the wind was down my way, so I got all the gas.
[00:43:24.208 --> 00:43:30.035]  I'm sitting here running through a cloud of smoke, and all you can see is just red flashes and explosions and gunshots.
[00:43:30.456 --> 00:43:34.641]  And it went, I, you know, it sounded like a lot of them were some regular actual gunfire.
[00:43:35.137 --> 00:43:36.678]  I mean, it was very intense.
[00:43:37.078 --> 00:43:41.479]  Well, they killed another guy the other night, probably, like the other fella.
[00:43:41.659 --> 00:43:43.060]  Well, they've all been shot in the back.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:44.900]  That's what real men do.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.861]  Did you guys act like this even in Iraq and Afghanistan?
[00:43:49.221 --> 00:43:52.943]  Because from what I know, the military wanted to win those wars.
[00:43:53.003 --> 00:43:54.803]  They didn't want to do stuff that would start a bigger one.
[00:43:55.563 --> 00:44:03.506]  I mean, I'll tell you right now, I'd say 95% of the people I ever came across in the military, these are guys that were just there for beneficial reasons like
[00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:05.029]  They wanted to go to college.
[00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:08.753]  They wanted to provide for their kids because they came from bad upbringings.
[00:44:08.773 --> 00:44:09.674]  They didn't have anything.
[00:44:09.934 --> 00:44:14.439]  And their only way to possibly have something in their life to look forward to was to join the military.
[00:44:14.459 --> 00:44:15.260]  They had big hearts.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.806]  And these are people, when we were over there in Iraq and Afghanistan, they would sit there like, you know, this stuff's not right, you know.
[00:44:20.866 --> 00:44:22.888]  And if something was bad, they were like, I don't want any part of this.
[00:44:23.328 --> 00:44:30.133]  You know, you might have one or two guys that just had that sadistic personality that just really wanted to go out and just start jumping people for no reason.
[00:44:30.373 --> 00:44:34.896]  But these guys, everybody they brought out here last night, were a bunch of sadistic nutjobs.
[00:44:35.436 --> 00:44:36.297]  It was crazy.
[00:44:36.517 --> 00:44:37.918]  These guys were ready to attack.
[00:44:38.098 --> 00:44:39.179]  That's what they came out for.
[00:44:39.479 --> 00:44:40.419]  What were we going to do?
[00:44:40.479 --> 00:44:41.640]  Throw cardboard at them?
[00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:42.921]  A set of keys?
[00:44:43.301 --> 00:44:48.265]  Well, it's just like when I was... I mean, it's just like when the Dallas Police Chief
[00:44:49.025 --> 00:44:59.531]  Says, yep, you're right, you guys are supposed to be able, the judge is ruling, First Amendment, now that the official events are over for the anniversary of JFK, you can go in.
[00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:06.376]  And then we go in, and they send out riot police from the county to physically attack even children.
[00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:12.575]  And at the point they started attacking this little girl, I said, that's it guys, we're going to go ahead and have to fight the cops.
[00:45:12.936 --> 00:45:14.698]  Then they gave them the order to back off.
[00:45:15.478 --> 00:45:16.860]  So they just wanted to dominate us.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.904]  And as soon as I said, all right, man, we can't let them, they just attacked the seven-year-old girl.
[00:45:21.645 --> 00:45:22.385]  I took my jacket off.
[00:45:22.426 --> 00:45:23.767]  I said, let's kick their ass.
[00:45:25.088 --> 00:45:27.351]  And then they got a radio and all pulled out.
[00:45:27.651 --> 00:45:29.192]  It's literal cowards.
[00:45:30.013 --> 00:45:31.294]  Little cowards.
[00:45:31.394 --> 00:45:35.357]  I mean, I've never seen anything this cowardly and pathetic.
[00:45:35.598 --> 00:45:36.939]  This nation is pathetic.
[00:45:37.219 --> 00:45:41.202]  And again, I want to tell the cops, you work for a criminal and legitimate government.
[00:45:41.222 --> 00:45:41.542]  Okay?
[00:45:41.963 --> 00:45:54.733]  And in a place like Austin, Texas, where they've had some questionable shootings, they have a big community thing, you know, they try to investigate it, they don't bring out armored vehicles and beach shields and put lasers on people, or East Austin would be burning!
[00:45:56.197 --> 00:46:02.009]  And again, I'm not even saying our police are perfect, but compared to this, I mean, this is how you stir people up, Joe.
[00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.093]  And you know that from Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:06.240]  Well, that's what they were purposely trying to do.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.961]  Like I said, they were the ones that were inciting the violence.
[00:46:08.981 --> 00:46:10.782]  They were the ones who wanted this to happen.
[00:46:10.802 --> 00:46:12.983]  Now, look at some of the chaos that happened.
[00:46:13.283 --> 00:46:15.043]  This is a pretty thick sign.
[00:46:15.464 --> 00:46:18.865]  After the rounds started flying and stuff last night, it literally punctured holes.
[00:46:19.225 --> 00:46:20.005]  Stuff was hitting that.
[00:46:20.065 --> 00:46:22.226]  Canisters were shooting at it, knocking that down.
[00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:26.828]  Across the road over here, you can see the fence they were trying to put back to family.
[00:46:27.088 --> 00:46:30.290]  The riot police knocked it down, trying to run after people.
[00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:33.111]  They ran into that person's backyard and knocked the fence down.
[00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:36.192]  And just a minute ago, the family was out there trying to put the fence back on.
[00:46:36.633 --> 00:46:42.115]  These were things that were getting thrown by them.
[00:46:43.936 --> 00:46:46.778]  Yesterday was a complete and total war zone.
[00:46:47.058 --> 00:46:48.959]  And I just want people to know they've got to wake up.
[00:46:49.099 --> 00:46:51.820]  Because this is not just going to happen in Ferguson.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.942]  This is going to start happening everywhere if we don't start doing something about it.
[00:46:55.282 --> 00:46:59.764]  I mean, the people out here were just screaming, like, why are we in a martial law state?
[00:47:00.124 --> 00:47:01.905]  You know, women were crying, like, you know,
[00:47:02.663 --> 00:47:03.824]  Why is this happening to us?
[00:47:04.284 --> 00:47:10.987]  Literally, there was a group of ladies that were sitting down in the crowd, crying and praying, saying, stop pointing guns at us.
[00:47:11.347 --> 00:47:12.808]  Stop pointing guns at our kids.
[00:47:12.988 --> 00:47:14.028]  We just want to grow up safe.
[00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:18.130]  Well, they built this giant police state up to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:22.172]  And Joe, who is IS made up of, and who gave weapons to ISIS?
[00:47:23.332 --> 00:47:24.553]  Yes, indeed.
[00:47:26.467 --> 00:47:29.048]  Our so-called government is evil.
[00:47:29.828 --> 00:47:34.009]  And you cannot make excuses for any of this stuff that's going on.
[00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:42.871]  And when you've got police multiple nights pointing guns at people, trying to stir them up, clearly it's going to start escalating.
[00:47:43.211 --> 00:47:45.071]  And this is being run by the Justice Department.
[00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:52.333]  I wish there was some way to de-escalate this, but you know they've got the psychological profiles of all these state troopers and feds they brought in.
[00:47:53.851 --> 00:48:00.096]  These are people that enjoy attacking innocent folks and attacking, you know, mainline camera people.
[00:48:00.776 --> 00:48:03.638]  I mean, this is designed undoubtedly to cause an explosion.
[00:48:04.059 --> 00:48:05.300]  Well, this was a war on race.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.782]  I mean, that's why they brought Al Sharpton out here.
[00:48:08.082 --> 00:48:10.864]  I spoke to some of the people in the crowd and I said, hey, did you have a chance to see him?
[00:48:11.144 --> 00:48:15.367]  And they were like, they use a little bit more colorful language, but they said, screw Al Sharpton.
[00:48:15.387 --> 00:48:16.308]  What has he done for us?
[00:48:16.708 --> 00:48:19.611]  And I said, well, what do you think about Lord and Savior President Obama?
[00:48:19.911 --> 00:48:21.312]  They said, screw that guy.
[00:48:21.352 --> 00:48:22.633]  He hasn't done a thing for us.
[00:48:23.257 --> 00:48:25.285]  He's like, they've never made any change for us.
[00:48:25.405 --> 00:48:27.152]  All they do is try to racially divide us.
[00:48:27.393 --> 00:48:28.095]  We're sick of this.
[00:48:28.135 --> 00:48:29.199]  We need real leadership.
[00:48:29.878 --> 00:48:50.209]  That's right, that's why they're run by the Ford Foundation to create racial division and all the Hollywood movies do that and that's the open job of Quentin Tarantino and of course Robert Rodriguez who meet with the president and have been offered hundreds of millions of dollars of government funding to create all the racial division with movies like Django Unchained and Machete, Machete and all the rest of it.
[00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:53.191]  This is the PSYOP and I know you've got those interviews.
[00:48:53.531 --> 00:48:55.332]  Gateway Pundit wrote about that as well.
[00:48:55.812 --> 00:48:57.413]  We need the video of that.
[00:48:57.873 --> 00:49:00.434]  Because just Gateway Pundit, you know, just has the Ustream of it.
[00:49:00.694 --> 00:49:05.716]  We need you to go out today and get HD interviews with those folks and get those up on Infowars.com.
[00:49:06.096 --> 00:49:11.358]  That's powerful truth showing that it's not Democrat versus Republican, black against white.
[00:49:12.523 --> 00:49:24.254]  That folks are waking up and their leader is not, like MSNBC is saying, Al Sharpton, the FBI operative, there to again play the part of black against white.
[00:49:24.274 --> 00:49:28.058]  We're going to go to break and come back with Jakari Jackson and others.
[00:49:28.879 --> 00:49:33.923]  In fact, let's go ahead and get Jakari on the line with us right now as we get ready to go to break.
[00:49:34.724 --> 00:49:37.307]  And then I want to get Josh Owens' take on this as well.
[00:49:38.359 --> 00:49:42.163]  I already had scheduled, I should add, some very important guests.
[00:49:42.724 --> 00:49:45.506]  The Joint, James O'Keefe's coming on and George Norrie today.
[00:49:46.568 --> 00:49:48.530]  We do have President Obama's talking.
[00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:50.652]  Let's go ahead and go to some of that and then come back from break.
[00:49:50.932 --> 00:49:52.254]  Here is our Lord and Savior.
[00:49:52.274 --> 00:50:01.243]  Protecting our people and facilities inside of Iraq and a humanitarian operation to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians on a mountain.
[00:50:01.463 --> 00:50:02.384]  After you funded Al-Qaeda?
[00:50:02.404 --> 00:50:08.528]  A week ago we assessed that many thousands of Yezidi men, women, and children... Obama looks like he has AIDS there.
[00:50:08.688 --> 00:50:10.850]  ...take refuge on Mount Sinjar... It's literary.
[00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:13.111]  ...in a desperate attempt to avoid slaughter.
[00:50:14.112 --> 00:50:20.696]  We also knew that ISIL terrorists were killing and enslaving Yezidi civilians... Yeah, and they're not Christians, so you've got to save them.
[00:50:21.277 --> 00:50:21.817]  ...to the mountains.
[00:50:22.017 --> 00:50:24.719]  Murderer, you supporter of nuclear order, Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:24.739 --> 00:50:25.880]  We faced a terrible choice.
[00:50:26.701 --> 00:50:29.723]  Starve on the mountain, or be slaughtered on the ground.
[00:50:30.831 --> 00:50:32.572]  That's when America came to help.
[00:50:34.013 --> 00:50:35.374]  Over the last week, the U.S.
[00:50:35.414 --> 00:50:38.317]  military conducted humanitarian airdrops every night.
[00:50:39.181 --> 00:50:43.102]  Delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons.
[00:50:43.122 --> 00:50:52.984]  Again, you bring Al-Qaeda in to murder everybody and then you save a small group and play the part of hero and bomb some artillery to make it look like you're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:53.265 --> 00:50:58.086]  Able to successfully strike ISIL targets around the mountain, which improved conditions for civilians.
[00:50:58.126 --> 00:50:59.946]  Now it's ISIL, it's not ISIS or IS.
[00:50:59.986 --> 00:51:02.047]  That's all on purpose to confuse everybody.
[00:51:02.407 --> 00:51:04.087]  We'll see what he says about Ferguson and play it.
[00:51:04.347 --> 00:51:06.368]  Jakari Jackson's coming up, then Josh Owens.

[00:53:12.417 --> 00:53:15.959]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying.
[00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:19.321]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[00:53:19.581 --> 00:53:20.782]  Chaos on our border.
[00:53:21.202 --> 00:53:23.263]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[00:53:23.724 --> 00:53:25.285]  Life is getting ready to change.
[00:53:25.665 --> 00:53:28.286]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.

[00:53:39.113 --> 00:53:48.377]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:53:48.417 --> 00:53:49.157]  This capitalism?
[00:53:49.217 --> 00:53:55.340]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:59.022]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:54:01.403 --> 00:54:01.743]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:54:26.141 --> 00:54:27.342]  I'm gonna say this again.
[00:54:28.363 --> 00:54:50.439]  In the United States of America, Washington Post, Al Jazeera, Infowars.com, reporters are being hit with rubber bullets, arrested, flashbanged for being 500 yards back with TV lights doing a report.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.282]  Our whole lives, we've grown up in the whole world,
[00:54:56.027 --> 00:55:01.990]  Even in third world countries, you don't see the police when they ride by on riot horses attacking crowds of people.
[00:55:04.452 --> 00:55:07.073]  In martial law countries, they don't go after the press.
[00:55:07.673 --> 00:55:10.115]  This is over the top.
[00:55:11.395 --> 00:55:14.497]  Well, reporters should have followed their orders and turned their cameras off.
[00:55:15.157 --> 00:55:16.978]  Turn their cameras off?
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.541]  This is the government that surveils us illegally.
[00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:23.442]  And then we're on public streets
[00:55:25.267 --> 00:55:26.728]  Trying to document what's happening.
[00:55:28.729 --> 00:55:31.570]  When they get a bunch of goons who want to start a war.
[00:55:32.671 --> 00:55:36.793]  A bunch of cowards who want to fight an old man tied down basically.
[00:55:38.013 --> 00:55:46.558]  Imagine a UFC fight where there's like an 89 year old man with his arms and legs tied and then Brock Lesnar in his prime comes out and starts body slamming him.
[00:55:46.878 --> 00:55:48.779]  I mean he would just boo Brock Lesnar.
[00:55:49.997 --> 00:55:59.159]  But only in America is the image of goat farmers being bombed by drones who were innocent while Al-Qaeda comes and attacks.
[00:55:59.319 --> 00:56:05.120]  And they bomb the farmers to make their sons go join Al-Qaeda to then have an ISIS force they arm.
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:07.501]  The globalists farm them.
[00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:09.841]  It's psych warfare.
[00:56:10.421 --> 00:56:14.122]  They go out and attack the blacks so they'll go join Al Sharpton and the Democrats.
[00:56:16.271 --> 00:56:19.334]  They make us color in the spaces by the numbers.
[00:56:19.955 --> 00:56:21.016]  They social engineer us.
[00:56:21.276 --> 00:56:21.997]  They sit back.
[00:56:22.117 --> 00:56:22.618]  They live.
[00:56:22.718 --> 00:56:23.218]  We sleep.
[00:56:23.539 --> 00:56:24.400]  They play their games.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.841]  We buy all their games.
[00:56:26.102 --> 00:56:32.448]  We buy into their trends and what they say is cool and their football and their media and all their crap.
[00:56:33.191 --> 00:56:34.151]  And we all lose.
[00:56:34.612 --> 00:56:37.733]  The cops, the whites, the blacks, everybody.
[00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:40.674]  Ja'Kari Jackson will be back at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:56:40.995 --> 00:56:42.655]  James O'Keefe's only on for two segments.
[00:56:43.015 --> 00:56:44.756]  And Josh Owens will have in-depth interviews with him.
[00:56:44.776 --> 00:56:48.838]  But Ja'Kari, this segment and the next, I gotta get your take on being in that war zone.
[00:56:49.398 --> 00:56:52.280]  I know you went up there, you know, totally non-biased.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.961]  And so did Josh and everybody.
[00:56:55.541 --> 00:56:59.643]  And boy, I want your take on this, because I gotta tell you, I am just upset.
[00:57:00.905 --> 00:57:01.965]  Upset is not the word.
[00:57:02.005 --> 00:57:06.367]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com, reporting from Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:57:06.887 --> 00:57:10.948]  Now, I'll give you guys kind of the long version of the story, Alex.
[00:57:11.248 --> 00:57:12.528]  We started way down the street.
[00:57:12.568 --> 00:57:13.489]  Maybe we can get a shot.
[00:57:13.529 --> 00:57:14.729]  This is where the Crick Trip is.
[00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:23.051]  The initial protest from yesterday, about four or five o'clock it started, was down this street past, I guess maybe you can see that public storage, that orange building over there.
[00:57:23.392 --> 00:57:25.492]  That's where we were initially congregated.
[00:57:26.012 --> 00:57:28.013]  The protesters peacefully assembled
[00:57:28.693 --> 00:57:31.837]  And the officers, they come out because the protesters were in the street.
[00:57:31.857 --> 00:57:34.059]  They say, protesters, can you please get into the street?
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:41.648]  And initially we were streaming live on Ustream, and I gave the cops credit because they came out here initially in relatively small numbers.
[00:57:41.688 --> 00:57:43.911]  I saw maybe about 10 or 12 guys initially.
[00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:46.574]  But they do that, again, to act like they were reasonable.
[00:57:46.954 --> 00:57:48.094]  Yeah, and that's the whole point.
[00:57:48.314 --> 00:57:49.915]  Because they come out here with the smaller force.
[00:57:49.955 --> 00:57:50.635]  I said, OK, good.
[00:57:50.995 --> 00:57:53.376]  Maybe everybody's learning that this isn't World War III.
[00:57:53.776 --> 00:57:58.197]  A few minutes later, or maybe about an hour or so later, they come out with the big MRAP trucks.
[00:57:58.257 --> 00:57:59.378]  I said, OK, here we go.
[00:57:59.718 --> 00:58:01.878]  Protesters get out the street because they're blocking the street.
[00:58:02.098 --> 00:58:09.040]  The protesters get on the sidewalk, and then the cops come and block the street all the way across in both directions, down that street and down this street.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.881]  And what you see me holding in my hand, I'll get to in just one second.
[00:58:11.941 --> 00:58:14.402]  So again, they were cuddling you to block you off.
[00:58:15.086 --> 00:58:23.148]  Yes, and then they start funneling us back here to the original location where Joe Biggs talks about the checkpoint right in front of the quick trip where they have barricades on both sides.
[00:58:23.468 --> 00:58:29.410]  I guess they're concerned about somebody attacking them, which is pretty ridiculous if somebody's going to come on with a full-on assault.
[00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:32.191]  So basically they push us back here to this location where we are now.
[00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:35.173]  People are having somewhat of a block party in the street.
[00:58:35.413 --> 00:58:39.917]  A church pulls up, is broadcasting, preaching a message from the back of a truck handing out water.
[00:58:39.937 --> 00:58:42.639]  And you know, somehow the police are concerned about this.
[00:58:42.919 --> 00:58:44.260]  So we're out here for a couple more hours.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.101]  Hold on, stay there.
[00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:46.322]  Well, of course they've got to attack you.
[00:58:46.762 --> 00:58:48.744]  Americans can't be allowed to hand out pamphlets.
[00:58:48.764 --> 00:58:49.905]  This isn't a free country.
[00:58:50.906 --> 00:58:53.328]  And again, Jakarro will break the whole thing down at the bottom of the hour.
[00:58:53.988 --> 00:58:54.649]  He's going to come back.
[00:58:54.689 --> 00:58:56.770]  Jakarro, I want to get your personal deal on all this.
[00:58:57.151 --> 00:58:59.953]  Then we'll get your whole reporter breakdown when we have the time.
[00:59:01.052 --> 00:59:02.813]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:59:03.354 --> 00:59:10.318]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:59:10.778 --> 00:59:21.165]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:59:21.606 --> 00:59:30.852]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:59:31.572 --> 00:59:34.993]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:59:35.634 --> 00:59:39.075]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:59:39.395 --> 00:59:40.975]  Experience the new formula.
[00:59:41.435 --> 00:59:43.436]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:59:44.036 --> 00:59:45.037]  Shield your family.
[00:59:45.357 --> 00:59:46.757]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:59:47.177 --> 00:59:49.758]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:50.338 --> 00:59:54.300]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.064]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.545 --> 01:00:08.330]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.243 --> 01:00:16.864]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.544 --> 01:00:18.565]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.306 --> 01:00:20.407]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.067 --> 01:00:21.868]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.649 --> 01:00:23.549]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:27.813]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.394 --> 01:00:32.497]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.998 --> 01:00:35.240]  There's a political cartoon up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:37.242 --> 01:00:49.352]  On the right-hand side, down towards the bottom, where we put the political cartoons, shows a man laying on the ground with his hands out towards the paramilitary police who fight the enemy, the American people, saying, don't shoot!
[01:00:50.674 --> 01:00:56.219]  And then the paramilitary occupier is turning back towards a news camera, screaming to them, don't shoot!
[01:00:56.239 --> 01:01:00.723]  Of course, they need to turn around with a rubber bullet and shoot the reporter in the face.
[01:01:01.163 --> 01:01:02.024]  Then it would be accurate.
[01:01:03.749 --> 01:01:10.931]  This is joke level, and it just shows a government that thinks it's God, and they put people in there that think they're God, and they've, why not?
[01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:16.953]  They've gotten trillions of dollars stolen, the borders are wide open, the government put us under UN control, and this is how it works.
[01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:25.776]  Jakari, I'm going to bring you back at the bottom of the hour, but I want you guys to go out and get these interviews with folks that I was told were telling you guys that they were
[01:01:26.596 --> 01:01:29.238]  They don't see Obama as their savior either.
[01:01:30.199 --> 01:01:38.867]  In fact, what Joe Biggs said, he was told his exact quote is being quoted by the Gateway Pundit, but I want to document that.
[01:01:40.548 --> 01:01:42.390]  Protesters last shouted Obama in Sharpton.
[01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:52.979]  That's important to bring conservatives and liberals together against, you know, all this garbage and don't want to make it a political, you know, like the pro-Obama forces or pro-demonstrators and then the
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.821]  The pro-police people are Republicans.
[01:01:56.841 --> 01:01:58.061]  That's how they want to divide this.
[01:01:59.062 --> 01:02:00.982]  I believe they're clearly trying to escalate this.
[01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:05.864]  Chakari, give me your take on what you think's happening here and just overall what you thought of the night.
[01:02:06.124 --> 01:02:09.465]  Then we'll come back to you in 30 minutes after James O'Keefe joins us.
[01:02:09.505 --> 01:02:11.426]  You can tell the whole story and give us a tour.
[01:02:12.671 --> 01:02:15.875]  Well, you know, it's a very, uh, it was a horrible situation.
[01:02:15.935 --> 01:02:19.539]  Just to put it in one word, if I could use one word, it was a horrible situation.
[01:02:19.839 --> 01:02:29.410]  Because as Joe Biggs pointed out, one guy throws a bottle that doesn't really even get close to the police, and they say, you are no longer peaceably assembled, now you have to clear the area.
[01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:33.294]  Even though, uh, maybe you saw one of our earlier reports, they had at least 70 guys
[01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:35.075]  We're good to go.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.542]  Uh, everybody now has to go home.
[01:02:57.902 --> 01:03:01.745]  And then the semantics in the games that they play telling you that you have to go home.
[01:03:01.805 --> 01:03:04.947]  We've documented that in multiple videos starting the first night we got here.
[01:03:05.247 --> 01:03:06.708]  And they're saying there is no curfew.
[01:03:06.948 --> 01:03:08.390]  They started saying that at about 4 or 5 p.m.
[01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:10.071]  Actually, I guess it's 6 p.m.
[01:03:10.171 --> 01:03:16.716]  Why don't you just start saying you're illegal aliens and then they would cook you dinner and maybe change any baby's diapers?
[01:03:17.236 --> 01:03:18.517]  Alright, but let me show you this Alex.
[01:03:18.818 --> 01:03:19.919]  This is what makes me so angry.
[01:03:19.939 --> 01:03:21.801]  This is what was used against us.
[01:03:21.821 --> 01:03:23.823]  You can see the triple chase.
[01:03:24.143 --> 01:03:26.785]  This is the smoke grenade and maybe we can get a look at this.
[01:03:27.526 --> 01:03:28.207]  It says smoke.
[01:03:28.723 --> 01:03:30.944]  By trained and authorized personnel only.
[01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:36.186]  So if you're trained and authorized to use this against unarmed American citizens, that is perfectly fine.
[01:03:36.406 --> 01:03:40.908]  And I'll be the first one to tell you, there were some guys out here throwing bottles and stuff at the police.
[01:03:41.288 --> 01:03:51.133]  But for the three people I saw throwing Molotov cocktails at the police, I personally had three smoke canisters fired at me in rapid fire right down this street.
[01:03:51.353 --> 01:03:54.274]  So I saw three Molotovs and I had them shoot three of these at me.
[01:03:54.694 --> 01:03:55.815]  Oh, let's be clear.
[01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:58.876]  They were targeting press that has a right to be there.
[01:03:58.896 --> 01:03:59.736]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:59.856 --> 01:04:05.018]  And I mean, look, I bet money that the guys throwing the mall offs work for them.
[01:04:05.578 --> 01:04:06.859]  And the cops may not even know that.
[01:04:07.279 --> 01:04:09.320]  I mean, I'm telling you, false flag.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.401]  If I had to make a guess, Eric Holder.
[01:04:12.441 --> 01:04:13.862]  We're trying to kick some stuff up.
[01:04:13.922 --> 01:04:19.024]  I can't go as far as say they work for any particular person, but I think they definitely wanted a conflict.
[01:04:19.454 --> 01:04:21.475]  And so the police, they gassed the whole area.
[01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:23.515]  They're telling people to return to their homes.
[01:04:23.796 --> 01:04:28.697]  I met a sweet old lady out here who actually gave me directions because I had to get off this main road where our vehicle was.
[01:04:28.957 --> 01:04:30.258]  Well, Jakari, I don't want to interrupt you.
[01:04:30.278 --> 01:04:32.478]  We're going to give you the floor at the bottom of the hour.
[01:04:32.498 --> 01:04:34.619]  And then we'll also talk to Josh Owens.
[01:04:34.699 --> 01:04:35.379]  Hold all that.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:36.780]  Tell it all in one story.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.361]  You guys get in the car, get some air conditioning, take a break.
[01:04:39.641 --> 01:04:40.381]  Then we'll talk to you.
[01:04:40.421 --> 01:04:41.822]  And at 1 o'clock, you can go get some lunch.
[01:04:42.762 --> 01:04:45.243]  And I guess you're going to be there tonight and tomorrow to see what happens, Jakari.
[01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:47.530]  Yeah, I'll see what's going on tonight.
[01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:50.433]  I'm not exactly sure what forces they're going to have out.
[01:04:51.033 --> 01:04:53.835]  Rumor is that they're not going to have the normal police, normal police.
[01:04:54.176 --> 01:04:57.899]  So we'll see who they bring out here to end the Bill of Rights tonight.
[01:04:58.319 --> 01:04:59.740]  Well, you can't tell who they are anyways.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.241]  They're all in commando outfits.
[01:05:01.822 --> 01:05:04.264]  Yeah, well, you know, no badge numbers, no names, no nothing.
[01:05:04.284 --> 01:05:05.725]  You can't ask these kinds of questions.
[01:05:05.825 --> 01:05:09.028]  Sound cannons, flashbangs, rubber bullets, tear gas.
[01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:17.441]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:19.704]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:05:19.884 --> 01:05:24.990]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:30.116]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:05:30.316 --> 01:05:33.377]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:05:33.637 --> 01:05:37.499]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:05:37.719 --> 01:05:41.961]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:52.065]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:05:52.265 --> 01:05:54.786]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:05:54.986 --> 01:06:03.036]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:06:10.387 --> 01:06:20.592]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:06:20.992 --> 01:06:27.174]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:06:27.294 --> 01:06:29.735]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:06:30.036 --> 01:06:32.897]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:06:32.937 --> 01:06:39.840]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:06:40.313 --> 01:06:43.816]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:47.939]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:48.259 --> 01:06:49.700]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:57.606]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:06:57.886 --> 01:06:58.727]  But for how long?
[01:06:59.027 --> 01:07:05.291]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:07:05.672 --> 01:07:08.474]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:07:10.166 --> 01:07:13.889]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[01:07:13.989 --> 01:07:15.190]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.331]  God knows what's in there.
[01:07:16.552 --> 01:07:20.635]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:07:20.815 --> 01:07:26.580]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.741]  That one is better.
[01:07:27.781 --> 01:07:28.742]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:07:29.042 --> 01:07:30.443]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[01:07:30.483 --> 01:07:30.984]  It's good water.
[01:07:31.084 --> 01:07:36.829]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:44.115]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[01:07:44.295 --> 01:07:46.837]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[01:07:47.017 --> 01:07:54.964]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.085]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.106]  It's good water.
[01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:57.746]  Refreshing.
[01:07:57.766 --> 01:07:58.187]  It's good!
[01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:00.808]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today.

[01:08:08.849 --> 01:08:16.691]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.071 --> 01:08:19.352]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:44.764 --> 01:08:47.605]  Well, James O'Keefe is with us till the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:49.866]  ProjectVeritas.com.
[01:08:49.906 --> 01:08:52.548]  I don't really need to introduce him to most of the audience.
[01:08:53.268 --> 01:08:54.028]  He's been arrested.
[01:08:54.088 --> 01:08:56.749]  They've tried to indict him for being a member of the press.
[01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:58.970]  He helped bring down Akron.
[01:09:00.919 --> 01:09:07.484]  And so much more by going in and saying he wanted to run underage prostitutes through their operation.
[01:09:08.364 --> 01:09:16.950]  He is the true example of real journalism and that's why the authoritarian left is always trying to have him put in prison.
[01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:20.953]  And I wanted to get him on about a story that broke over the weekend.
[01:09:20.973 --> 01:09:22.414]  It was on Drudge for like three days.
[01:09:23.534 --> 01:09:27.097]  A stunt that was genius to show how wide open the border is.
[01:09:27.557 --> 01:09:29.799]  So we sent reporters down to go back and forth across the river.
[01:09:30.942 --> 01:09:38.992]  But dressed up like Osama Bin Laden in the whole jihadi outfit just to show how ridiculous it is.
[01:09:40.174 --> 01:09:42.116]  And that's how you capture the public's attention.
[01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:45.901]  So I wanted to play a clip of that as well after we talked some with him today.
[01:09:45.921 --> 01:09:48.244]  But James O'Keefe, Obama just came out.
[01:09:49.636 --> 01:09:54.920]  Five minutes ago, we have the clip coming up after you leave us, and said, oh, I'm for the First Amendment.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:58.443]  You know, we shouldn't be attacking the press in Ferguson.
[01:09:58.483 --> 01:10:01.525]  And then the governor came out and said he's going to get the bottom of it.
[01:10:02.185 --> 01:10:03.266]  I don't support the looters.
[01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:11.953]  I don't know the truth about who shot this 18-year-old man, you know, on purpose or whether it was an accident or was a scuffle, Michael Brown.
[01:10:12.313 --> 01:10:18.478]  But I have reporters there that were shot with rubber bullets, flashbangs, sound cannons, Al Jazeera's hundreds of yards away.
[01:10:19.238 --> 01:10:30.224]  They say turn your cameras off on loudspeakers and then start firing at my reporters and others, arresting Washington Post reporters and people in a McDonald's down the road as they're there ordering coffee.
[01:10:30.244 --> 01:10:33.345]  I mean, this is not a free country.
[01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:38.248]  As somebody who's been targeted, you know, you came to the aid, I came to the aid of
[01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:51.139]  People like Dinesh D'Souza, when he got indicted on trumped up, made up garbage about giving a few thousand dollars to a friend of his who was running for the Senate, we came to his aid.
[01:10:51.739 --> 01:10:57.524]  If Bush would have had Michael Moore arrested, I would have come to his aid, even though I don't like Michael Moore.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.921]  Is the press going to stick together on this?
[01:11:00.942 --> 01:11:06.866]  I mean, I don't even know your take on this yet, so I'm going out on a limb here, but regardless, this is different issues.
[01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:17.693]  The Michael Brown shooting, and the way the police are acting, and the fact that they're following federal orders to aim lasers at my reporters and others that are, you know, hundreds of yards away.
[01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:21.096]  I mean, this is getting really bizarre.
[01:11:21.496 --> 01:11:27.040]  James O'Keefe, this could be the crisis, just like with Trayvon Martin,
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.842]  We know the Justice Department there got caught stirring stuff up with secret agents.
[01:11:31.862 --> 01:11:33.183]  That came out in mainstream news.
[01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:35.164]  This thing stinks to high heaven.
[01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:36.845]  What's your take on it?
[01:11:37.608 --> 01:11:43.450]  Well, I mean, I saw that the two journalists were arrested and there's outrage on Twitter about it.
[01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:46.350]  I myself have been arrested.
[01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:47.971]  I was falsely accused.
[01:11:48.031 --> 01:11:49.451]  They're calling it a false arrest.
[01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:55.593]  And I think it's outrageous what they're doing to the guys at the Huffington Post and the Washington Post.
[01:11:56.893 --> 01:11:58.513]  Ryan Reilly and I have butted heads.
[01:11:58.553 --> 01:11:59.654]  He's a civil rights reporter.
[01:11:59.694 --> 01:12:00.194]  He's opposed
[01:12:00.854 --> 01:12:07.259]  Photo ID laws and he's... They celebrated it when I got arrested and really it comes down to labels.
[01:12:07.459 --> 01:12:08.119]  Who's a journalist?
[01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:09.020]  Who's not a journalist?
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:15.344]  When I wear a hidden camera and work for YouTube, you know, I'm not a journalist, therefore I'm not afforded the rights that they are.
[01:12:16.625 --> 01:12:25.511]  I saw that Rand Paul just has a new piece out on Time Magazine just minutes ago where he talks about the militarization of police forces.
[01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.854]  I mean, I think, I've been on your show before, I've said that
[01:12:29.494 --> 01:12:37.817]  You know, as long as you're gathering information in my book, you're considered a journalist and you should have all the rights and privileges afforded to journalists.
[01:12:38.357 --> 01:12:45.000]  But it's really scary to see what's happening out there and now there's even reports that they're looking out for people who are tweeting.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.602]  Citizens who are tweeting, they're going to come after them.
[01:12:49.023 --> 01:12:55.809]  But I think that, you know, we've been on the front lines and certainly have been attacked and they've celebrated our arrest.
[01:12:56.069 --> 01:13:00.533]  It's good to know now that people are looking out for these journalists getting arrested because it's an important thing.
[01:13:01.445 --> 01:13:02.205]  Well, exactly.
[01:13:02.485 --> 01:13:05.286]  And I've noticed you've defended the press, whether it be left or right.
[01:13:05.927 --> 01:13:10.288]  And again, we see the left calling for free speech to be shut down.
[01:13:11.168 --> 01:13:21.412]  Whenever the IRS goes after free speech organizations and non-profit press groups, MSNBC goes on and says, yeah, shut down the Tea Party.
[01:13:21.692 --> 01:13:22.932]  Of course we're auditing you.
[01:13:23.192 --> 01:13:24.693]  You're a terrorist organization.
[01:13:25.133 --> 01:13:27.134]  But then Rachel Maddow freaks out
[01:13:27.734 --> 01:13:31.916]  When the Huffington Post people get arrested, hey, how about we freak out all the time here?
[01:13:32.076 --> 01:13:33.537]  Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
[01:13:33.557 --> 01:13:38.299]  There needs to be outrage no matter who the person getting arrested is.
[01:13:38.399 --> 01:13:43.161]  Just because the Washington Post reporter, I saw there's 10,000 retweets.
[01:13:43.862 --> 01:13:48.724]  Society becomes more outraged when it's a member of the establishment media class.
[01:13:49.304 --> 01:13:56.351]  But if it's a blogger or an independent person, the right needs to defend the left just as much as the left should defend the right.
[01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:59.434]  Rachel Maddow has spent so many hours attacking me.
[01:14:00.495 --> 01:14:01.496]  James is discredited.
[01:14:01.576 --> 01:14:02.497]  He was arrested.
[01:14:02.617 --> 01:14:03.638]  James was arrested.
[01:14:04.098 --> 01:14:06.881]  Well, is that now the thing that makes you discredited?
[01:14:06.921 --> 01:14:08.002]  Josh Fox was arrested.
[01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:09.183]  He's an Academy Award winner.
[01:14:09.203 --> 01:14:10.965]  Martin Luther King was arrested 150-something times.
[01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:14.729]  And it's a false arrest.
[01:14:14.749 --> 01:14:16.932]  The whole point of it, it's a false arrest.
[01:14:16.992 --> 01:14:20.275]  The police assaulted Ryan Reilly yesterday.
[01:14:20.295 --> 01:14:21.296]  They assaulted him.
[01:14:21.817 --> 01:14:24.620]  They threw me against a car in New Orleans.
[01:14:24.981 --> 01:14:26.723]  They destroyed my evidence.
[01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:37.075]  And we need to stop this left-right thing when it comes to this particular issue of police brutality and civil rights.
[01:14:37.876 --> 01:14:39.037]  What's happening with the police?
[01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:43.622]  Because you've been arrested and thrown in jail and harassed so many times.
[01:14:44.103 --> 01:14:45.224]  How do cops
[01:14:46.491 --> 01:14:59.911]  And again, most cops aren't like this, but more and more cities have special units that will just march up and assault and beat up and falsely charge even mainline media now, who's been defending bloggers and folks being attacked.
[01:15:00.592 --> 01:15:01.854]  I mean, what's wrong with them?
[01:15:03.444 --> 01:15:07.505]  Well, I agree with Rand Paul's column that he just wrote.
[01:15:07.725 --> 01:15:14.687]  He said that most police officers are good cops and good people, and it's a difficult job in circumstances.
[01:15:14.707 --> 01:15:16.568]  So I'm not necessarily faulting the police.
[01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:21.970]  And my interaction is actually with the federal agents in New Orleans.
[01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:48.395]  People who are former police officers who became FBI agents, but I think that it's it's it's a top-down problem You know the people just like this situation on the border this past This past week we went down there and we the federal agents were nowhere to be found They're kind of just doing their jobs, but it's the people on top It's the people in Washington that are given the orders to them not to do their jobs or to do a different job but
[01:15:50.256 --> 01:15:57.701]  There's an increasing effort to make journalism illegal in this country.
[01:15:57.801 --> 01:16:00.623]  To make gathering information when you're out in the field.
[01:16:00.643 --> 01:16:03.224]  I'm not talking about people who sit in cubicles in New York City.
[01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:06.527]  People who are out there in the field gathering information.
[01:16:06.867 --> 01:16:11.190]  There is an effort to try to either destroy their character
[01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:12.631]  Or put them in jail.
[01:16:13.172 --> 01:16:17.315]  And now, and just now, we're starting to see it on the left.
[01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:24.202]  We're starting to see people at mainstream media outlets face the same type of issues that you've faced, and I've faced, and citizen journalists have faced.
[01:16:25.011 --> 01:16:31.336]  That's right, and it's scary to see it intensifying, and now they have internet kill switches going in.
[01:16:31.817 --> 01:16:34.639]  Obama's making announcements, commandeering my phone all the time.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.041]  Even when it's off, it turns on with Obama messages.
[01:16:37.382 --> 01:16:39.423]  My dad, my mom, everybody I know is getting them.
[01:16:39.644 --> 01:16:43.507]  The whole office phones ring, and I get, you know, these weird Democrat messages.
[01:16:44.107 --> 01:16:51.994]  Now they passed a bill in California to make kill switches by law, be in all the phones, so police can turn them off during situations like this.
[01:16:53.874 --> 01:16:55.996]  The genie cannot be put back in the bottle.
[01:16:56.756 --> 01:17:01.540]  Let me expand on this with you, and then talk about your border investigation.
[01:17:02.861 --> 01:17:12.709]  What do you make of attempts by the IRS to shut down free speech, and now the IRS isn't getting in any trouble?
[01:17:13.530 --> 01:17:19.495]  James, that's what concerns me, is that they've gotten away with all this, and that what's bad is about to get a lot worse.
[01:17:20.049 --> 01:17:40.823]  Yeah, there was someone comment, and by the way, what's happening with the Washington Post and the Huffington Post, it's deplorable and it's outrageous, but it is interesting to note that when Catherine Engelbrecht in Texas gets audited by the IRS and her company faces harassment from the Justice Department, that is equally bad.
[01:17:40.883 --> 01:17:44.145]  I mean, we're talking about two, both of these things are bad, but nobody cares about the IRS.
[01:17:45.746 --> 01:17:52.132]  Harassing innocent people, harassing, you know, auditing Andrew Cuomo, auditing me in New York State.
[01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:53.033]  No one cares about that.
[01:17:53.053 --> 01:17:56.055]  It's only about this one incident now in Missouri.
[01:17:56.496 --> 01:18:02.981]  But I mean, I've said publicly that I'm going to do an investigation into the IRS.
[01:18:03.021 --> 01:18:04.463]  I'm going to go undercover.
[01:18:05.163 --> 01:18:06.625]  I have to be careful because
[01:18:07.245 --> 01:18:12.487]  The IRS is a federal agency and there are laws which the federal government interprets broadly.
[01:18:12.868 --> 01:18:15.929]  So if I'm going undercover into a federal building, I have to be careful.
[01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:20.471]  But I'm going to investigate the IRS, probably in the fall or in the wintertime.
[01:18:20.951 --> 01:18:29.195]  And I'd love to get on tape, on undercover tape, people like Lois Lerner speaking candidly about her motives and about
[01:18:31.087 --> 01:18:32.128]  Well, you know where to go.
[01:18:32.148 --> 01:18:33.168]  I mean, you reported on it.
[01:18:33.589 --> 01:18:44.716]  In Dallas, when people pointed out they were Democrats, they have Democrat parties with stickers and they all get in big meeting halls and basically chant and admit they're on a team to target conservatives.
[01:18:44.776 --> 01:18:48.299]  I mean, they're like Nazis or the Soviets.
[01:18:48.339 --> 01:18:49.520]  I mean, they know they're bad.
[01:18:50.336 --> 01:18:51.897]  Well, you gotta go to the conferences.
[01:18:51.937 --> 01:18:55.500]  You gotta go to where they have, like in the IRS, the Congo line.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:58.742]  You know, going to the summits, the conferences, the barbecues.
[01:18:59.082 --> 01:19:02.545]  You gotta go to their Las Vegas parties, exactly.
[01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:04.046]  And you gotta get them speaking.
[01:19:04.066 --> 01:19:10.490]  If we had videotape of Lois Lerner saying exactly how she felt about the Tea Party, everything would change.
[01:19:11.051 --> 01:19:12.632]  Forget Congress, forget the hearings.
[01:19:13.152 --> 01:19:17.135]  We'd bypass that and go right to the, it would outrage everyone.
[01:19:17.515 --> 01:19:26.661]  And I think like the Osama Bin Laden thing, you know, the whole notion of terrorists crossing into the United States, that's not a divisive issue.
[01:19:26.701 --> 01:19:28.182]  Immigration is a divisive issue.
[01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:31.824]  People are like, I like immigrants, I don't like immigrants, that it's racist, you're not racist.
[01:19:32.164 --> 01:19:38.788]  But the moment you switch to something, you know, like targeting people and getting it on tape, I think that's going to bring people together.
[01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.249]  That's exactly what I want to get on tape.
[01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.931]  Well, I mean, you're not just a journalist, James.
[01:19:42.951 --> 01:19:44.092]  You've changed the world.
[01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.353]  Thank you.
[01:19:45.874 --> 01:19:46.554]  No, thank you.
[01:19:46.874 --> 01:19:57.543]  And then I'm just sick of all these lazy New York Times and CNN people, oh, you read the New York Times, you're so smart, when they just go around regurgitating pseudo-intellectual crap from the White House.
[01:19:57.924 --> 01:20:00.746]  So you're not as good as the New York Times.
[01:20:01.006 --> 01:20:02.928]  You're a thousand times better, and I mean it.
[01:20:03.368 --> 01:20:04.029]  Thank you.
[01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:08.132]  We are the new press, and we wear our bias to promote freedom and tell the truth openly.
[01:20:08.352 --> 01:20:08.793]  We'll be back.
[01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:12.552]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?

[01:21:15.383 --> 01:21:16.564]  China getting out of U.S.
[01:21:16.624 --> 01:21:17.185]  Treasuries.
[01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:24.489]  At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at $11 trillion, gold trading around $850 per ounce.
[01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:30.433]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1,600 per ounce.
[01:21:31.434 --> 01:21:34.436]  The $20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[01:21:34.676 --> 01:21:38.619]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[01:21:38.799 --> 01:21:41.061]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[01:21:41.481 --> 01:21:47.106]  A hundred years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your own gold standard.

[01:24:19.047 --> 01:24:19.807]  I'm James O'Keefe.
[01:24:19.907 --> 01:24:24.468]  I'm right in the center of the Mexican-American border, and I see no border patrol.
[01:24:24.528 --> 01:24:25.448]  I see no security.
[01:24:26.788 --> 01:24:28.909]  Thousands of people have stood in my footsteps right now.
[01:24:29.029 --> 01:24:33.650]  They've come from South America, Honduras, Guatemala, and they've all crossed the border.
[01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:37.851]  And if they can cross, anybody can cross.
[01:24:38.591 --> 01:24:39.651]  And I'm here today to ask you,
[01:24:42.503 --> 01:24:43.204]  Do you feel safe?
[01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:47.830]  He's dressed as Osama Bin Laden crossing the river.
[01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:57.823]  He even walks like Bin Laden.
[01:24:57.843 --> 01:24:58.604]  Is that Bin Laden?
[01:24:59.065 --> 01:24:59.505]  Or is it Obama?
[01:25:06.132 --> 01:25:08.517]  See the whole video at ProjectVeritas.com.
[01:25:08.577 --> 01:25:10.661]  James, I want to get you back for a full hour in the near future.
[01:25:10.981 --> 01:25:15.850]  We obviously sell your book that chronicles all the amazing things you and your group have been part of and it's a...
[01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:21.310]  How to go out and be a true grassroots, muckraking journalist.
[01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:30.533]  You and Matt Drudge and others are heralding the return, and InfoWars as well, and my reporters and many others, of journalism.
[01:25:31.173 --> 01:25:34.954]  The mainstream has become a vacuum because they don't operate like journalists, they're repeaters.
[01:25:35.535 --> 01:25:40.076]  When they do journalistic activities, they get rubber-bulleted and arrested.
[01:25:40.897 --> 01:25:44.118]  In closing, in the five minutes we've got left, Matt Drudge last year
[01:25:45.298 --> 01:25:59.842]  tweeted that Senator Feinstein was a fascist, and she is a fascist, saying that the New York Times could have journalistic protections but you and I couldn't, that it has to be a mainline media group and that Congress has to say who has the First Amendment.
[01:26:00.602 --> 01:26:03.623]  Well, that's like the state saying they can say what churches can exist.
[01:26:04.423 --> 01:26:10.905]  We've all got to come together as the press and as the people and decry what's happened or we're going to lose it all.
[01:26:11.525 --> 01:26:13.846]  The system is threatened by this and the cops
[01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:17.652]  I mean, if there's no First Amendment, they're going to lose their Second Amendment.
[01:26:18.413 --> 01:26:20.174]  And so we're all in this together.
[01:26:21.715 --> 01:26:25.678]  Your take on what we face as a society and where you see us as a culture.
[01:26:26.218 --> 01:26:30.781]  I think it requires ordinary citizens stepping outside their comfort zone.
[01:26:31.141 --> 01:26:33.823]  You made a comment in the last segment.
[01:26:33.863 --> 01:26:38.847]  You said they're sitting in their cubicles in New York or they're sitting in New York City in Washington.
[01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:41.869]  Some people got to get out into the field.
[01:26:41.909 --> 01:26:43.070]  They got to take their cameras
[01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:53.897]  Outside the newsroom, and go out into the crowd, and I don't care whether you're on the left or the right, the fact that you're in Missouri or you're in Texas, you're on the border.
[01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:55.058]  A lot of people criticize me.
[01:26:55.398 --> 01:26:56.519]  What are you doing down there, James?
[01:26:56.559 --> 01:27:00.001]  Aren't you making a mockery of this whole border debate by dressing up like Osama?
[01:27:00.041 --> 01:27:05.545]  And I said, actually, CNN showed images of the lack of offense.
[01:27:06.105 --> 01:27:09.788]  And they were only showing those images because of what we did at Project Veritas.
[01:27:09.828 --> 01:27:12.890]  We forced the mainstream media to cover issues they don't want to talk about.
[01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:15.571]  They always complain when we're successful and change the world.
[01:27:15.891 --> 01:27:28.153]  Bringing down Akron, exposing the IRS, you've done that and dozens of other world-shaking stories so they say you don't have an effect and you're pathetic and you're discredited because you got arrested.
[01:27:28.173 --> 01:27:29.493]  I mean it's ridiculous.
[01:27:29.513 --> 01:27:32.634]  They say Drudge doesn't have any power and I don't have any power.
[01:27:32.854 --> 01:27:33.594]  It's pure bull.
[01:27:33.854 --> 01:27:36.255]  They're losing the power because they're frauds.
[01:27:36.295 --> 01:27:37.095]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:27:37.355 --> 01:27:45.323]  They need to leave their air-conditioned offices and go out into the country and take a camera.
[01:27:46.684 --> 01:27:47.805]  Here's how we change the world.
[01:27:48.266 --> 01:27:51.228]  All the people that consider themselves journalists, let's say there's 10 or 20,000 of them,
[01:27:52.910 --> 01:28:00.577]  Just take a camera, leave your office, go to a local government office and start asking difficult questions.
[01:28:00.957 --> 01:28:05.942]  If all the journalists just took a camera and started asking questions, the world would be a better place.
[01:28:06.002 --> 01:28:06.863]  But they're not going to do that.
[01:28:06.883 --> 01:28:08.204]  They're going to sit on Twitter all day.
[01:28:08.744 --> 01:28:13.369]  And I urge journalists to do this type of thing.
[01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:22.712]  And as far as Feinstein is concerned and all those people, yeah, it's very scary stuff, but they can't stop all of us, so we gotta stick together and step outside our comfort zones and go out in the field.
[01:28:22.732 --> 01:28:23.472]  That's my solution.
[01:28:24.172 --> 01:28:29.734]  Well, you're absolutely right, and mainstream media's ratings continue to plunge while our ratings go up and up and up.
[01:28:30.194 --> 01:28:33.075]  I call them the dinosaur media, I call us the real media.
[01:28:33.095 --> 01:28:39.057]  I mean, what's the best name for establishment media in your view, and then what's the best name for us?
[01:28:39.497 --> 01:28:41.719]  I would call them political marketing officials.
[01:28:42.099 --> 01:28:47.683]  I would not call them journalists because they're advertisers for the political marketing industry.
[01:28:48.183 --> 01:29:02.993]  That's like Politico.com is a sort of ruling class marketing machine that they basically... Politico.com serves the political class in Washington, and then the political class in Washington serves Politico.com.
[01:29:03.613 --> 01:29:05.815]  What we should call ourselves is journalists.
[01:29:05.855 --> 01:29:09.038]  I'm even thinking about abandoning the citizen portion of that.
[01:29:09.078 --> 01:29:09.899]  Just journalists.
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:13.022]  Because that's the role of a journalist, is to speak truth to power.
[01:29:13.663 --> 01:29:15.885]  And I think that's what we should refer.
[01:29:15.925 --> 01:29:21.230]  But these labels, these notions that, well, he's a journalist, therefore it's wrong for that he got arrested.
[01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:25.655]  But O'Keefe and Alex Jones, well, they're not journalists, so I hope they rot in prison.
[01:29:26.376 --> 01:29:28.159]  These labels are just ridiculous.
[01:29:28.219 --> 01:29:34.372]  The fact is we're exposing the truth, we're speaking truth to power, and you're going out into the field to gather information.
[01:29:34.841 --> 01:29:35.461]  Absolutely.
[01:29:35.661 --> 01:29:38.703]  And everybody needs to get out and do their own YouTubes, their own news.
[01:29:39.143 --> 01:29:41.504]  And then there's no way they can ever censor all of it.
[01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:44.846]  The real revolution is the info war right now.
[01:29:44.926 --> 01:29:47.847]  James O'Keefe, from all the info warriors, we salute you.
[01:29:48.128 --> 01:29:51.329]  Look forward to your next incredible triumph over tyranny.
[01:29:51.609 --> 01:29:53.770]  And folks need to support you and us as well.
[01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:57.452]  That's another way to fight back is for people to support true independent journalists.
[01:29:57.492 --> 01:29:58.373]  Thank you so much, James.
[01:29:58.493 --> 01:29:58.793]  Thank you.
[01:29:59.153 --> 01:30:02.154]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.095 --> 01:30:05.836]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.638 --> 01:30:16.580]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.982]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:21.362 --> 01:30:25.924]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:26.324 --> 01:30:28.946]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:29.246 --> 01:30:34.428]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:41.572]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:42.093 --> 01:30:45.855]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:46.215 --> 01:30:51.017]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:51.337 --> 01:30:52.178]  This is innovating.
[01:30:52.458 --> 01:30:59.767]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:59.947 --> 01:31:04.012]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:31:52.932 --> 01:31:54.093]  High quality supplements.
[01:31:54.234 --> 01:31:59.520]  It's all 10% off the already lowest price in this back to school week.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:02.043]  History is taking place right now.

[01:32:39.939 --> 01:32:44.303]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:32:44.584 --> 01:32:49.228]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:32:49.348 --> 01:32:50.349]  Talk about the effects.
[01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:52.151]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:32:52.171 --> 01:32:53.773]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:32:54.093 --> 01:32:55.154]  I feel like I look better.
[01:32:55.214 --> 01:32:55.835]  I feel better.
[01:32:55.855 --> 01:32:56.976]  I feel sexier.
[01:32:56.996 --> 01:32:57.757]  I love it.
[01:32:57.957 --> 01:33:01.000]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:33:01.061 --> 01:33:03.804]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[01:33:04.004 --> 01:33:05.045]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:33:05.085 --> 01:33:06.126]  Consult your physician.
[01:33:06.266 --> 01:33:08.449]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[01:33:08.469 --> 01:33:09.470]  This is life changing.
[01:33:20.274 --> 01:33:22.395]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:22.875 --> 01:33:24.736]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.756 --> 01:33:28.098]  It's the time of the season.
[01:33:30.139 --> 01:33:32.179]  Where the blood runs high.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:34.320]  In this time.
[01:33:34.801 --> 01:33:36.421]  Give it to me easy.
[01:33:38.462 --> 01:33:42.264]  And let me try with pleasured hands.
[01:33:42.764 --> 01:33:44.365]  To take you in this time.
[01:33:52.327 --> 01:34:02.695]  I want to salute our reporters and all the other independent free press out there doing a great job who aren't state-run.
[01:34:02.735 --> 01:34:09.821]  We're going to talk for the rest of the hour with Jakari Jackson and Josh Owens and Joe Biggs who are there in Ferguson.
[01:34:10.942 --> 01:34:16.546]  We do have the clip of Obama's response coming up that actually sounds very reasonable and fair what he said.
[01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:20.050]  But again, it's all a disingenuous PSYOP.
[01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:22.511]  I predicted he would do just this last hour.
[01:34:23.631 --> 01:34:29.252]  Before he spoke, I said that Obama would come out and do exactly what he has now done.
[01:34:30.713 --> 01:34:36.994]  Well, you know, this is a local issue, so we weren't really in control of it, and we need to investigate.
[01:34:37.014 --> 01:34:40.475]  The police need to be transparent about what happened to Michael Brown, who was shot.
[01:34:41.348 --> 01:34:49.355]  Last weekend, and we also need people not to use this as cover for looting or vandalism and, you know, for attacking police officers.
[01:34:49.375 --> 01:34:50.697]  There's never a good time to do that.
[01:34:52.398 --> 01:35:01.046]  And then he goes on to say, but we also need to not have the police attacking peaceful protesters and the press just doing their job.
[01:35:02.207 --> 01:35:03.769]  But meanwhile, the surrogates
[01:35:05.151 --> 01:35:07.132]  Are out there all running with PSYOP.
[01:35:07.553 --> 01:35:14.238]  While he's calling for calm on Trayvon Martin, the Justice Department's in there actually organizing the demonstrations, trying to get riots going.
[01:35:14.878 --> 01:35:22.264]  Because if he can get a bunch of black people rioting around the country, that'll get folks off the subject of Fast and Furious and open borders and the rest of it.
[01:35:23.765 --> 01:35:26.407]  We're gonna go to our guests in a minute, but it's not good luck, they say.
[01:35:26.747 --> 01:35:30.269]  And I'm not superstitious, but... I am, just to be safe.
[01:35:31.110 --> 01:35:32.471]  People, I'm not superstitious, but I am.
[01:35:32.771 --> 01:35:33.432]  Knock on wood.
[01:35:35.424 --> 01:35:37.805]  I think being superstitious just means you don't take everything for granted.
[01:35:37.825 --> 01:35:38.545]  You're not arrogant.
[01:35:40.686 --> 01:35:42.826]  I found some of the smartest people I know are superstitious.
[01:35:43.246 --> 01:35:46.627]  They say you don't toast with water.
[01:35:46.947 --> 01:35:55.130]  So I'm going to put in a Super Mel Vitality for my lunchtime dose into this filtered water.
[01:35:56.410 --> 01:36:02.332]  Then I'm going to put a squirt of Survival Shield X2 in there and stir it up.
[01:36:03.933 --> 01:36:04.813]  And then my new
[01:36:06.621 --> 01:36:11.164]  Super product of the secret product that's going to be coming out in a few months.
[01:36:11.865 --> 01:36:13.005]  I'll put a score to that in there.
[01:36:15.007 --> 01:36:24.533]  And this is my little cocktail, even though there's zero alcohol in it, that I'm going to have from all natural gifts that God gave us.
[01:36:28.425 --> 01:36:29.365]  Absolutely delicious.
[01:36:29.886 --> 01:36:32.227]  I'm going to be enjoying the rest of that while we talk to our reporters.
[01:36:32.827 --> 01:36:47.393]  Again, I toast Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, Josh Owens, Kit Daniels, Adon Salazar, Kurt Nemo, Leigh Ann McAdoo, Marcos Morales, Rob Dew, Darren McBreen, John Bowne, the entire crew in here.
[01:36:49.175 --> 01:36:49.775]  Just everybody.
[01:36:49.795 --> 01:37:01.381]  I need to go through the whole list, but especially the folks that were out there in the field last night and my reporters that were writing about it at 1 a.m., Kit Daniels and others, did a great job covering what happened so far.
[01:37:01.421 --> 01:37:10.785]  We'll have more coverage tonight on the Nightly News and throughout the evening with our reporters who have chosen to stay in Ferguson for the foreseeable future while this unfolds.
[01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:16.668]  I know Jakari and others have got to come back and take care of their dogs and stuff, but we need to have another team go up to Ferguson.
[01:37:16.988 --> 01:37:17.949]  If this continues,
[01:37:18.951 --> 01:37:22.834]  I'm going to go up to Ferguson, probably next Monday.
[01:37:22.854 --> 01:37:26.156]  It's just a hop, skip and a jump up there, so we're going to do that.
[01:37:26.396 --> 01:37:30.058]  Now, I've done an hour and 37 minutes of broadcasting today and I've not plugged anything.
[01:37:31.379 --> 01:37:34.121]  It's very expensive to send reporters all over the country and all over the world.
[01:37:34.461 --> 01:37:36.283]  It's very expensive to run this operation.
[01:37:37.443 --> 01:37:45.208]  So we don't get Rockefeller funding or banker bailout money, stimulus money, or taxpayer money like NPR and MSNBC.
[01:37:46.226 --> 01:37:50.489]  We are funded by selling high-quality water filtration at the lowest price.
[01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:51.130]  Free market.
[01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:55.033]  High-quality, groundbreaking supplements at the lowest price.
[01:37:55.093 --> 01:37:56.214]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:57.435 --> 01:37:59.376]  Molon Labe designer belt buckles.
[01:37:59.977 --> 01:38:01.197]  And George Washington belt buckles.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.782]  Now, continuing here, folks.
[01:38:08.385 --> 01:38:25.891]  It is absolutely essential that you support us, and you've been doing that, but if people did a lot more, with your free will, you're buying war bonds, or basically working in a factory building bombs, so that our pilots can go out and take on the enemy.
[01:38:26.471 --> 01:38:43.965]  I mean, that's the equivalent of what you're doing when you buy the high-quality coffee or get the high-quality 1776 products at MadeIn1776.com, when you buy a ball cap, when you buy a Moan Labe t-shirt, when you buy a book, when you buy a film, when you buy the magazines in bulk at cost, you're helping get the word out.
[01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:48.349]  It's all about fighting the tyranny.
[01:38:49.434 --> 01:38:55.747]  And the money goes right back into this operation, right back into funding our operation and expanding what we're doing.
[01:38:56.408 --> 01:39:00.076]  Infowarslife.com PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:39:02.975 --> 01:39:22.992]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and even if you can't buy the fine products we've got, that I'm extremely proud of, you can tell friends and family about the broadcast, you can spread the word about the show, and people will come here and get a perspective they're not getting anywhere else that has shown itself to be the zeitgeist on the pulse of what's happening.
[01:39:23.332 --> 01:39:25.394]  And I'm not like a lot of other talk show hosts.
[01:39:25.814 --> 01:39:27.015]  I want to just win this thing.
[01:39:27.035 --> 01:39:29.256]  I don't want to live in a big mansion and have private jets.
[01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:31.377]  Not that that's bad if you make the money on your own.
[01:39:31.397 --> 01:39:31.777]  That's great.
[01:39:31.797 --> 01:39:32.698]  That's how the economy works.
[01:39:33.338 --> 01:39:37.380]  My treasure, the fortune I want, is to defeat these tyrants.
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:38.861]  I want to win the game.
[01:39:40.322 --> 01:39:41.202]  It isn't a game at all.
[01:39:41.282 --> 01:39:41.742]  It's life.
[01:39:42.463 --> 01:39:46.905]  It's my soul, my children's soul, your soul, your children's soul, your future.
[01:39:47.505 --> 01:39:49.666]  It's about being honorable in my time alive.
[01:39:49.726 --> 01:39:50.767]  It's about being real.
[01:39:50.947 --> 01:39:52.028]  It's about being a man.
[01:39:52.048 --> 01:39:53.408]  It's about being fearless.
[01:39:53.448 --> 01:39:54.589]  It's about being strong.
[01:39:55.731 --> 01:39:56.932]  It's about conquering fear.
[01:39:57.492 --> 01:40:02.114]  That's why you see me out at public events where I'm being death-threatened with no bodyguards, and why I advertise that.
[01:40:02.134 --> 01:40:06.117]  And it's not because I have a death wish, it's because I have transcended the fear.
[01:40:06.997 --> 01:40:08.498]  I have transcended the weakness.
[01:40:09.338 --> 01:40:10.059]  I am ready.
[01:40:10.199 --> 01:40:10.979]  You understand that?
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:17.142]  And I don't look forward to anything happening, but I am committed.
[01:40:17.263 --> 01:40:18.323]  I will not be a coward.
[01:40:18.763 --> 01:40:21.645]  I will die a man, like my ancestors before me.
[01:40:22.705 --> 01:40:23.426]  That's what matters.
[01:40:27.198 --> 01:40:30.521]  It comes down to that poem, Child Rollin' the Dark Tower Came.
[01:40:32.382 --> 01:40:34.584]  And there they were all to see the last of me.
[01:40:35.164 --> 01:40:38.247]  And dauntless I lifted the slughorn to my lips in blue.
[01:40:38.787 --> 01:40:40.569]  Child Rollin' the Dark Tower Came.
[01:40:41.329 --> 01:40:47.995]  You understand that 14 minute poem, if it's read by book, on audio tape, you can find it on YouTube.
[01:40:48.015 --> 01:40:50.437]  If you understand that poem, you understand it all.
[01:40:50.457 --> 01:40:52.038]  It's what it's all about.
[01:40:53.490 --> 01:41:05.994]  And if you're a woman, it's about being beautiful when you're young and being a great mother as you grow and then being someone who guides your family and is a rock through hard times to build the next generation and move forward as well.
[01:41:07.434 --> 01:41:11.755]  That's what will give you fulfillment, not trying to be a tart when you're 60 years old.
[01:41:13.936 --> 01:41:15.877]  Like Joan Rivers, you know, who's like 80-something.
[01:41:16.917 --> 01:41:20.658]  Those are the most vapid, empty, unhappy people because they worship the flesh.
[01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:34.480]  And the low-level bestiality that this whole system creates and pushes, turning us into animals, instead of reaching for our higher angels.
[01:41:36.862 --> 01:41:37.703]  I'm gonna stop preaching.
[01:41:37.743 --> 01:41:47.251]  The point is, we bring on all these other hosts, all these other people, and I celebrate James O'Keefe, even though Project Veritas has never promoted anything we've done.
[01:41:48.931 --> 01:41:54.873]  I celebrate other talk show hosts that tell the truth and get the word out in our venues to enlighten others.
[01:41:56.473 --> 01:41:58.134]  We got George Norrie coming on last hour.
[01:41:59.094 --> 01:41:59.934]  He's a big man.
[01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:13.038]  Nobody, when he first started having me on 13 years ago, it's gotta be that long ago now, while time flies, nobody has other talk show hosts on, people like George Norrie and myself.
[01:42:13.914 --> 01:42:15.135]  No national host does that.
[01:42:15.396 --> 01:42:16.296]  Michael Savage does it.
[01:42:16.857 --> 01:42:21.221]  More and more you see it happening because people... It isn't about the ego of the show.
[01:42:21.261 --> 01:42:22.322]  It isn't about who's the biggest.
[01:42:22.382 --> 01:42:23.423]  It's about having a future.
[01:42:23.724 --> 01:42:25.706]  It's about taking care of your children and grandchildren.
[01:42:25.986 --> 01:42:28.749]  It's about sharing info and trying to save the world.
[01:42:29.489 --> 01:42:30.370]  The people in the world.
[01:42:30.570 --> 01:42:31.071]  From the world.
[01:42:33.095 --> 01:42:44.879]  And, I mean, it is a real pleasure, and I relish seeing Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs and Josh Owens do an incredible job out there in Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:42:45.919 --> 01:42:53.641]  And to see them get shot with rubber bullets and hit with tear gas, and to have the courage to do what they did, and to be honorable and have the moral authority through it.
[01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:58.302]  It is so good to have kinsmanship with people like that.
[01:42:58.443 --> 01:42:59.743]  That's what life's all about.
[01:43:01.015 --> 01:43:07.340]  To have a feeling of satisfaction at their chivalry for all of our freedoms.
[01:43:09.361 --> 01:43:10.942]  That's what builds a civilization.
[01:43:12.343 --> 01:43:16.807]  I mean, the footage we've got in HD that's coming in now from the guys is like something out of a movie.
[01:43:16.827 --> 01:43:17.767]  We're showing some of it now.
[01:43:18.148 --> 01:43:24.152]  The war zone and how the police have been militarized and prepared for the public.
[01:43:28.246 --> 01:43:37.708]  I guarantee you, reading about western justice and stuff, 150 years ago, one sheriff in a place like Dodge City or Tombstone could have walked.
[01:43:37.968 --> 01:43:52.930]  One Texas Ranger could have gone up to a crowd like that, in almost every case, talked them down and gotten them to stop by promising to get justice, by bringing community leaders in to see the evidence, by firing a cop or arresting a cop that shot somebody innocent.
[01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:53.890]  They would have had respect.
[01:43:54.130 --> 01:43:57.011]  This whole thing would have been shut down, bam, just like that.
[01:43:57.691 --> 01:44:04.896]  Instead, you see the spectacles like this that could cause this country to burn and start a civil war that the globalists want, that I've been warning you about.
[01:44:05.316 --> 01:44:10.059]  Let's go now to the sweltering heat, 105 degrees, in the middle of Missouri with Jakari Jackson.
[01:44:10.279 --> 01:44:16.443]  Jakari, tell the story now of what unfolded yesterday, then we'll talk to our valiant cameraman, Josh Owens.
[01:44:17.777 --> 01:44:19.979]  Chikari Jackson reporting from Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:44:20.279 --> 01:44:23.461]  Now, as you just mentioned, Alex, it got pretty hot last night.
[01:44:23.782 --> 01:44:25.363]  It's not just the heat from the summer.
[01:44:25.683 --> 01:44:28.865]  It was the heat from the flashbang grenades that set this whole thing off.
[01:44:28.885 --> 01:44:31.547]  Maybe you can hear behind me all the people driving by.
[01:44:31.567 --> 01:44:32.368]  They're honking.
[01:44:32.388 --> 01:44:33.909]  They're showing their support for the community.
[01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:42.035]  It's a large church group out here who are out here trying to wake people up, not just to the police state, but also trying to get them spiritually ready for the things to come.
[01:44:42.455 --> 01:44:45.237]  But going through the story last night, we got here probably about 4 or 5 p.m.
[01:44:46.538 --> 01:44:51.322]  And the protesters, peacefully at that time, were gathered right down the street from where we are.
[01:44:51.762 --> 01:44:52.643]  And they were in the street.
[01:44:52.963 --> 01:44:54.584]  And the police come up with small numbers.
[01:44:54.604 --> 01:44:56.265]  They say, hey, can you guys get out of the street?
[01:44:56.525 --> 01:44:57.366]  You're blocking the street.
[01:44:57.686 --> 01:44:59.587]  So the protesters eventually get on the sidewalk.
[01:44:59.648 --> 01:45:01.389]  That's when they pull up with the big MRAP trucks.
[01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:09.331]  And then they're out there, uh, 70-plus guys, heavy armor, batons, helmets, guys on top of the MRAPs with the snipers aimed at people.
[01:45:09.551 --> 01:45:12.731]  They didn't just have them on the terrace, they were aiming them at people in the crowd.
[01:45:13.051 --> 01:45:15.632]  I was standing close enough to them, Alex, where I could hear what they were saying.
[01:45:15.872 --> 01:45:18.192]  And look at that guy in the orange shirt, look at that guy in the red shirt.
[01:45:18.212 --> 01:45:24.394]  And I look around, and it's some guy who's, you know, has his hand behind his back, stretching like this, but I guess they think that he's reaching for a weapon.
[01:45:24.734 --> 01:45:28.815]  And then the guy, uh, another guy had all the smoke agents, all the, uh, the chemical agents.
[01:45:29.075 --> 01:45:30.135]  A lot of...
[01:45:30.675 --> 01:45:32.196]  A lot of support going on out here.
[01:45:32.856 --> 01:45:41.058]  So, uh, eventually they say, you can protest in the daytime, then they come out and they say you can't protest in the daytime, even though it's 6pm, the sun was clearly out.
[01:45:41.379 --> 01:45:42.639]  So everybody's standing on the sidewalks.
[01:45:42.819 --> 01:45:44.300]  You guys can't stand on the sidewalk.
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:48.521]  I said, well, sir, this is a public sidewalk, is what we're saying to these guys.
[01:45:48.761 --> 01:45:50.101]  They said you can't stand here.
[01:45:50.121 --> 01:45:52.502]  By the way, do they say sir back to you?
[01:45:52.582 --> 01:45:53.963]  No, they don't treat you with respect.
[01:45:54.023 --> 01:45:54.903]  No, they don't do that.
[01:45:55.323 --> 01:45:57.664]  So they start pushing myself, they start pushing Joe Biggs.
[01:45:57.944 --> 01:46:01.908]  We have to all move back because they're saying if you stay here you're going to get arrested.
[01:46:01.948 --> 01:46:03.309]  So they're shoving us.
[01:46:03.609 --> 01:46:05.131]  If you stay here you're going to get arrested.
[01:46:05.151 --> 01:46:08.113]  So they're brutalizing us as they're telling us to get down the street.
[01:46:08.494 --> 01:46:11.156]  So eventually get to the area where we are now.
[01:46:11.196 --> 01:46:12.357]  We see all these protesters.
[01:46:12.678 --> 01:46:13.899]  Everybody's peaceful in the streets.
[01:46:14.199 --> 01:46:17.382]  People were having somewhat of a block party in the middle of the street.
[01:46:17.402 --> 01:46:20.525]  We're showing HD footage you guys have not had a chance to upload to us.
[01:46:21.085 --> 01:46:28.057]  Of them training their M4, M16s on peaceful people even during the daylight.
[01:46:28.358 --> 01:46:30.462]  I mean, this is so provocative.
[01:46:31.246 --> 01:46:31.866]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:46:32.126 --> 01:46:36.348]  And another thing, Alex, when they were moving the big MRAPs, they kept saying, nobody throw anything.
[01:46:36.368 --> 01:46:37.608]  We're like, we're not throwing anything.
[01:46:37.848 --> 01:46:38.809]  Nobody throw anything.
[01:46:38.869 --> 01:46:41.109]  Nobody was throwing anything at that point.
[01:46:41.389 --> 01:46:43.690]  The guy who threw the initial bottle was several hours later.
[01:46:44.050 --> 01:46:47.232]  So we're out here because the police have the streets blocked off in both directions.
[01:46:47.552 --> 01:46:54.334]  So church groups out here, there's at least three or four people out here, three or four hundred people out here at that time.
[01:46:54.850 --> 01:47:08.414]  And so everybody's out here congregating, and then eventually, probably about two or three hours later, once the sun went down, you know, somebody took it upon themselves to throw a bottle at the police, and because one guy threw a bottle, nobody can have a First Amendment anymore.
[01:47:08.654 --> 01:47:16.616]  Even though they had 70-plus heavy armor guys who could have easily ran out here and caught that one guy, no, nobody can be out here because we're no longer peaceably assembled.
[01:47:16.636 --> 01:47:21.898]  Well, Zakaria, that's like when one teenage kid's running and is hiding in a boat, they shut down half the city,
[01:47:22.518 --> 01:47:28.101]  And go in people's houses grabbing blonde haired women by the hair, dragging them out and aiming guns at people.
[01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:29.241]  Just like Boston.
[01:47:29.321 --> 01:47:30.842]  It's all a power grab.
[01:47:30.862 --> 01:47:32.243]  That's what this is all about.
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:34.321]  Oh, it is a power grab.
[01:47:34.541 --> 01:47:35.803]  Because they're out here power tripping.
[01:47:35.823 --> 01:47:36.844]  They're on the loudspeakers.
[01:47:37.164 --> 01:47:39.347]  Get back and then you hear the soft voice woman.
[01:47:39.847 --> 01:47:41.950]  She says, please turn off your cameras.
[01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:43.772]  Or she said, just turn off your cameras.
[01:47:44.072 --> 01:47:44.793]  We all look at each other.
[01:47:44.813 --> 01:47:46.074]  They say, just turn off your cameras.
[01:47:46.395 --> 01:47:47.776]  No, we're not going to turn off our cameras.
[01:47:48.037 --> 01:47:54.223]  Because if you think about all the hostility we got while our cameras are on, how much more when the cameras are off?
[01:47:56.428 --> 01:47:59.810]  Well, you're absolutely right, Jakari, and so much more has happened.
[01:47:59.830 --> 01:48:03.932]  I mean, now we're getting the HD footage you guys shot in the dark last night.
[01:48:04.973 --> 01:48:10.716]  You're in neighborhoods, and they're chasing after people, just like when Rob Dew got arrested in Pittsburgh for the G20.
[01:48:10.756 --> 01:48:25.405]  The G20 was over, and they went to the university to find kids out at night in the park eating dinner, and were assaulting women on bicycles, and then chasing people into the dorms, attacking them like mad dogs.
[01:48:26.297 --> 01:48:32.739]  That's what it was, it was a mad dog mentality because some of these people, well not some, many of these people live in this neighborhood right behind me.
[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:37.401]  So they were shooting tear gas and rubber bullets at people standing in their own front yards.
[01:48:37.981 --> 01:48:43.984]  And I was with, you guys probably saw when they threw the flashbang at Al Jazeera, I was standing right there when that happened.
[01:48:44.224 --> 01:48:47.385]  Because we all got separated, myself and the rest of the InfoWars crew.
[01:48:47.765 --> 01:48:49.206]  And I saw a bunch of camera people.
[01:48:49.226 --> 01:48:52.007]  There's also a local NBC affiliate over there as well.
[01:48:52.267 --> 01:48:53.747]  I said, okay, they're probably not going to attack us.
[01:48:53.767 --> 01:48:54.407]  They see the lights.
[01:48:54.427 --> 01:48:55.208]  They see the cameras.
[01:48:55.548 --> 01:48:57.609]  No, they said, okay, we see a good lit up target.
[01:48:57.829 --> 01:48:58.729]  Let's attack these guys.
[01:48:58.749 --> 01:49:00.190]  And they shot the guy from Al Jazeera.
[01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:03.471]  So we all take off running because they have the, they keep shooting the smoke.
[01:49:03.811 --> 01:49:05.471]  And I had to actually hop over somebody's fence.
[01:49:05.491 --> 01:49:09.573]  And when you guys saw in the video, they shot a three flash bangs at me, bang, bang, bang.
[01:49:09.893 --> 01:49:11.234]  So I had to hop over somebody's fence.
[01:49:11.494 --> 01:49:11.974]  We're running.
[01:49:11.994 --> 01:49:12.414]  We had to run
[01:49:12.614 --> 01:49:12.934]  I think so.
[01:49:30.031 --> 01:49:46.004]  This black car is, and they just went all the way down the street, just shooting smoke, flashbangs, going down the street is where we found the ordinance that Joe Biggs was showing you about the rubber bullets, about the gas canisters, all that stuff was going all the way down the street.
[01:49:46.225 --> 01:49:50.888]  I mean, like Joe Biggs said, there was a huge plume of smoke going all the way down the street.
[01:49:51.209 --> 01:49:53.310]  It no doubt went into this neighborhood behind us.
[01:49:53.591 --> 01:49:57.214]  So innocent people who were just out sitting on their front porch had to breathe this as well.
[01:49:57.794 --> 01:50:01.356]  Well again, Jakari Jackson reporting from Ferguson, Missouri, if you just joined us.
[01:50:02.056 --> 01:50:13.361]  Jakari, you guys plan to be there tonight and throughout the next few nights, and we'll get more reporters up there to relieve you, so we need to start setting that up via the weekend, then I guess if it's still going on, I'll make plans to go up there on Monday.
[01:50:13.381 --> 01:50:21.264]  I've got child issues and things I've got to take care of this weekend, but who knows, I may have to go up there regardless, because it looks like this is starting to escalate.
[01:50:21.624 --> 01:50:23.585]  Any word on what we know is coming up tonight?
[01:50:24.847 --> 01:50:33.753]  Well, all I've heard is that, I believe it was reported by RT, that the local police are no longer going to police this area, even though they didn't really seem like police to me.
[01:50:33.793 --> 01:50:36.035]  They seem more like an invading military force.
[01:50:36.515 --> 01:50:38.517]  So who's going to replace them, if that is true?
[01:50:38.617 --> 01:50:40.378]  I'm not sure if it's going to be National Guard.
[01:50:40.398 --> 01:50:42.379]  I'm not sure if it's going to be some private outfit.
[01:50:42.779 --> 01:50:43.200]  I don't know.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:46.122]  So we have to wait and see at this point.
[01:50:46.162 --> 01:50:51.005]  But we have seen local police, state troopers and so forth, driving up and down here.
[01:50:51.045 --> 01:50:52.206]  They're not blocking anything off.
[01:50:52.646 --> 01:50:55.407]  At this point, they usually start the blockade by about 3 or 4 o'clock.
[01:50:55.927 --> 01:51:00.769]  So, we'll probably find out around that time who's actually going to be out here, uh, quote, policing the air.
[01:51:00.829 --> 01:51:02.350]  Lights out, America!
[01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:03.170]  Lights out!

[01:54:59.597 --> 01:55:00.397]  Do not panic.
[01:55:01.358 --> 01:55:07.724]  Your neighborhood watch officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.
[01:55:09.111 --> 01:55:16.517]  Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples will be shot.

[01:55:26.964 --> 01:55:32.228]  National security is more important than individual will.

[01:56:02.791 --> 01:56:04.132]  Everything is done!
[01:56:09.813 --> 01:56:11.474]  That's Jelebi Afra bringing us in.
[01:56:11.734 --> 01:56:13.416]  Now we got our cameraman Josh Owens.
[01:56:13.836 --> 01:56:18.740]  Josh, you were there at the Bundy Ranch where the feds stood down because they knew people had firearms.
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:21.422]  And now you've witnessed this here.
[01:56:22.002 --> 01:56:23.283]  It's just incredible.
[01:56:23.583 --> 01:56:25.785]  They tried to say everybody at Bundy was racist whites.
[01:56:25.825 --> 01:56:27.226]  Now they're saying it's racist blacks.
[01:56:27.646 --> 01:56:30.469]  No, they're just humans that don't want to be hunted and killed.
[01:56:31.169 --> 01:56:39.495]  And I don't want to make the police the enemy either, but they're being given orders and doctrines that are authoritarian and will cause civil war.
[01:56:39.955 --> 01:56:45.159]  Josh Owens, Infowars.com cameraman, give us your take on what you've witnessed in Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:47.941]  Josh Owens, reporting from Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:56:47.961 --> 01:56:53.425]  Yeah, I would like to give my account of what happened, because it's a little bit different than theirs.
[01:56:53.825 --> 01:56:56.347]  It all started right back here, where we were all together.
[01:56:57.199 --> 01:57:10.472]  They start coming in, they start throwing flashbangs, throwing tear gas, Biggs runs over here, gets shot, Jakar runs to the other side of the street, and I run straight down this street right here that you can see behind me.
[01:57:11.933 --> 01:57:16.558]  As soon as I start running, they start shooting tear gas all around my feet.
[01:57:17.250 --> 01:57:20.031]  And I'm not the healthiest guy in the world, so I'm breathing heavily.
[01:57:20.691 --> 01:57:25.613]  And I literally cannot catch my breath, and I start vomiting immediately.
[01:57:25.653 --> 01:57:27.494]  I know it's disgusting, but this is just what happened.
[01:57:27.814 --> 01:57:30.035]  I start vomiting immediately, and I go blind.
[01:57:30.235 --> 01:57:31.836]  I can't see anything.
[01:57:32.396 --> 01:57:37.078]  I run into a car over here as they're continuing to throw explosions all around me.
[01:57:37.598 --> 01:57:40.760]  I run into a car, and someone was nice enough to give me some water.
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:41.700]  I throw it in my eyes,
[01:57:42.395 --> 01:57:48.881]  We all keep running down there while I'm still trying to film them pushing forward, throwing flashbangs, throwing tear gas.
[01:57:50.042 --> 01:57:58.750]  As soon as I get down here, probably, I don't know, one-fourth of a mile, they start flooring the MRAPs.
[01:57:59.110 --> 01:58:00.772]  They start running towards us.
[01:58:02.073 --> 01:58:03.154]  They start arresting people.
[01:58:03.514 --> 01:58:06.858]  So I start running down this road and I run into a neighborhood.
[01:58:06.878 --> 01:58:08.279]  They chase me into a neighborhood.
[01:58:09.073 --> 01:58:18.061]  And inside the neighborhood, over the houses, they're throwing tear gas into the streets of the neighborhood because a lot of people were running... And by the way, those are very flammable.
[01:58:18.101 --> 01:58:19.182]  You're not supposed to do that.
[01:58:19.222 --> 01:58:20.483]  That's a big news issue.
[01:58:20.783 --> 01:58:22.445]  That's what probably burned down Waco.
[01:58:24.086 --> 01:58:26.228]  Wow, you're saying they were shooting those over houses?
[01:58:26.628 --> 01:58:28.910]  They were shooting them over houses into the neighborhood.
[01:58:29.210 --> 01:58:34.155]  So I'm running through the neighborhood, still vomiting, completely blind.
[01:58:34.215 --> 01:58:35.716]  I cannot see anything.
[01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:39.858]  And, uh, luckily enough, I found someone in a car.
[01:58:39.918 --> 01:58:41.599]  I actually ran into the car.
[01:58:41.899 --> 01:58:43.020]  And it was a vice reporter.
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.421]  She let me into the car.
[01:58:44.661 --> 01:58:45.682]  Hold on, I want to hear about this.
[01:58:45.722 --> 01:58:46.662]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:46.943 --> 01:58:48.344]  Then George Norrie's coming up.
[01:58:52.766 --> 01:58:56.729]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:00.499 --> 01:59:06.383]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:59:06.403 --> 01:59:09.745]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:59:09.845 --> 01:59:11.426]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted.
[01:59:11.446 --> 01:59:17.750]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:23.754]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:59:23.914 --> 01:59:27.657]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:59:27.857 --> 01:59:30.739]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:59:30.759 --> 01:59:38.945]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:59:39.205 --> 01:59:41.267]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:59:41.307 --> 01:59:42.348]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:59:42.708 --> 01:59:51.473]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:20.251]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.932 --> 02:00:21.732]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.513 --> 02:00:23.413]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.054 --> 02:00:27.676]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.256 --> 02:00:32.339]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.519 --> 02:00:34.800]  We're back.
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:38.242]  Josh Owens, Infowars.com, reporter and cameraman.
[02:00:38.282 --> 02:00:39.603]  He was at Bundy Ranch, you name it.
[02:00:41.284 --> 02:00:44.068]  What an exciting and dangerous job it is now.
[02:00:44.669 --> 02:00:49.735]  I've been through a lot of this stuff myself, but it's time for me to start going out on some more of these as well, just so I'm even.
[02:00:50.316 --> 02:00:52.278]  Can't let all the young bucks have all the fun.
[02:00:52.659 --> 02:00:54.201]  So you're running through neighborhoods now.
[02:00:54.241 --> 02:00:58.486]  I saw some of that HD footage you sent us, so I guess even though you were vomiting and stuff...
[02:00:59.687 --> 02:01:03.968]  I'm guessing it's you, because it came in from your box of the HD footage.
[02:01:04.448 --> 02:01:05.948]  It looks eerie, like out of a movie.
[02:01:06.008 --> 02:01:09.849]  Men in black uniforms marching, smoke, trees lining a little neighborhood.
[02:01:09.869 --> 02:01:15.210]  So you're there, you run into this Vice car, Vice magazine, Vice HBO.
[02:01:15.590 --> 02:01:16.831]  You get in the car with a reporter.
[02:01:16.851 --> 02:01:18.831]  Now watch it, you got a girlfriend, Josh.
[02:01:19.151 --> 02:01:20.411]  Tell us what else happened next.
[02:01:22.092 --> 02:01:23.332]  So, I jump in the car.
[02:01:23.532 --> 02:01:28.173]  I'm still, I'm opening the door to continue throwing up, because I don't want to throw up in this nice woman's car.
[02:01:28.777 --> 02:01:34.779]  I can't see anything, and we try and pull out of the neighborhood, because I think we're in a car now, they're going to let us out.
[02:01:35.079 --> 02:01:40.720]  We try to pull out of the neighborhood, they start shooting flashbangs at the car as we're trying to pull out.
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:50.623]  So we floor it through the neighborhood, there's no other way out of the neighborhood except these two exits, both blocked off, and any cars that come by the exits, they're shooting flashbangs at the car.
[02:01:50.883 --> 02:01:53.964]  They're arresting reporters, so if I walked out, they would have arrested me.
[02:01:54.424 --> 02:01:56.625]  So we sit there for about 30 minutes.
[02:01:57.065 --> 02:02:08.270]  I still cannot see anything and finally we see them pull out to this other exit over here and we floor it out of there and go down this street and I meet up with the guys down there.
[02:02:08.651 --> 02:02:11.112]  And like you said, I was at Bundy Ranch.
[02:02:12.212 --> 02:02:13.693]  We were detained.
[02:02:14.535 --> 02:02:18.997]  in San Antonio for trying to catch Bo Bergo coming in.
[02:02:19.877 --> 02:02:23.038]  The NSA facility, they tried to threaten us and take our footage.
[02:02:23.418 --> 02:02:27.780]  This is the most surreal experience of my life to this day.
[02:02:34.301 --> 02:02:36.663]  My gut says that tonight it's going to be worse.
[02:02:36.763 --> 02:02:42.488]  I don't know if that's true, but my gut is saying that tonight people are pissed off about what happened last night.
[02:02:42.508 --> 02:02:45.330]  They kept being pushed and pushed and pushed and then they were attacked.
[02:02:46.752 --> 02:02:54.758]  I think a lot of reporters are scared now because they don't feel like they have carte blanche to stand on the side of the street and report, which a lot of them were standing there because they thought they were going to be left alone.
[02:02:55.339 --> 02:02:57.561]  So I think tonight it's going to get worse.
[02:03:01.112 --> 02:03:05.794]  Well, it's all about power and control, but the government is now illegitimate at so many levels.
[02:03:06.775 --> 02:03:08.536]  And I don't want the breakdown of legitimacy.
[02:03:08.596 --> 02:03:14.939]  I wish the government would pull up, but people are sick of the lies, they're sick of the fraud, and more force is not the answer.
[02:03:14.959 --> 02:03:17.740]  I wish this could be de-escalated.
[02:03:18.381 --> 02:03:20.362]  And you guys have already gotten incredible footage.
[02:03:20.762 --> 02:03:22.703]  I want you guys to stay off to the side tonight.
[02:03:23.976 --> 02:03:28.219]  And in back of the other reporters, because, I mean, you've already been up front.
[02:03:28.999 --> 02:03:31.480]  I don't want you, I want you guys to really try to stay safe up there.
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:35.143]  We'll obviously bail you out, like I did, Rob do.
[02:03:35.383 --> 02:03:40.386]  If you get arrested, we'll sue them and we'll win, like we won that settlement that we're not allowed to talk about.
[02:03:41.406 --> 02:03:42.607]  But we don't want to win settlements.
[02:03:43.407 --> 02:03:47.050]  You know, we have to sue because we have to show we're in the right.
[02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:49.071]  But quite frankly, I don't want to mess with it.
[02:03:50.131 --> 02:03:52.473]  But if they arrest any of you guys or keep attacking you,
[02:03:54.278 --> 02:03:58.921]  We probably could win a lawsuit right now with Biggs getting shot if we can prove they targeted him on purpose.
[02:03:59.301 --> 02:04:01.483]  I was watching Jakari's videos where he's like, hey, stop it!
[02:04:01.523 --> 02:04:05.426]  And you know, he said they were shooting at him because they knew he was a reporter.
[02:04:05.906 --> 02:04:06.887]  I mean, is that what you witnessed?
[02:04:07.674 --> 02:04:17.397]  Yeah, yeah, and I honestly, I think the reason they were trapping people into this neighborhood is because I think they saw reporters go in the neighborhood and I don't think they wanted people to leave with the footage that they had.
[02:04:17.417 --> 02:04:23.800]  Well, I mean, obviously they're on tape saying, please turn your cameras off and grabbing Al Jazeera's cameras and shooting rubber bullets at them.
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.220]  I mean, think about that.
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:26.280]  Exactly.
[02:04:26.781 --> 02:04:28.801]  I mean, they are trying to kettle everybody.
[02:04:29.562 --> 02:04:30.842]  So, I mean, they're so dumb.
[02:04:30.862 --> 02:04:33.143]  They don't know Al Jazeera was transmitting that footage out.
[02:04:33.763 --> 02:04:35.063]  I mean, don't they understand?
[02:04:35.083 --> 02:04:36.284]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:46.333]  Well, like you said earlier, if this was the old West and there was an old West Sheriff out here that came out and talked to people face-to-face like they were humans, then you know what?
[02:04:46.373 --> 02:04:50.514]  A lot of these people, they don't come out here wanting to incite violence.
[02:04:50.594 --> 02:04:54.795]  At least the last couple nights that we've been here, they come out here peaceably and then these
[02:04:56.252 --> 02:05:00.075]  These police come up in tanks pointing guns at people.
[02:05:00.135 --> 02:05:03.298]  If you can see in that b-roll that I sent, they were pointing a gun at me.
[02:05:03.318 --> 02:05:04.178]  Oh, I saw that!
[02:05:04.399 --> 02:05:08.242]  The guys on the top of the armored vehicle aiming it right at your camera.
[02:05:08.702 --> 02:05:09.603]  I mean, what a punk!

[02:05:43.952 --> 02:05:47.914]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:48.234 --> 02:05:49.674]  Can you put two and two together?

[02:06:41.235 --> 02:06:43.576]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:44.076 --> 02:06:45.716]  They're never going to stop.
[02:06:46.016 --> 02:06:49.937]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:08:37.150 --> 02:08:43.033]  Well, Rand Paul has come out in a Time Magazine piece saying we must demilitarize the police.
[02:08:44.014 --> 02:08:48.996]  Even the New York Times and Washington Post and others, Wall Street Journal have been saying that as well.
[02:08:50.057 --> 02:08:56.460]  400 armored vehicles, 500 aircraft, 93,000 machine guns given to local police just this year so far.
[02:08:57.001 --> 02:08:59.562]  Pentagon weaponry confirmed in St.
[02:08:59.602 --> 02:09:00.363]  Louis County.
[02:09:00.383 --> 02:09:02.584]  Yeah, no, those are the MRAPs from Iraq.
[02:09:05.253 --> 02:09:08.214]  Missouri Cops Gas News Crew.
[02:09:08.254 --> 02:09:11.155]  We've been showing this incredible footage.
[02:09:12.555 --> 02:09:16.716]  And our own reporters were there, hit with rubber bullets, flash-banged.
[02:09:16.816 --> 02:09:20.237]  They're on the tape by Al Jazeera, running away.
[02:09:20.838 --> 02:09:21.818]  And they say on the tape,
[02:09:22.614 --> 02:09:29.278]  I mean, our video, they say, in a woman's voice, it's like in a science fiction movie, please report to the local FEMA camp.
[02:09:29.598 --> 02:09:32.080]  They're like, please stop filming now.
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:34.521]  Stop filming now.
[02:09:35.042 --> 02:09:36.182]  And they just open fire.
[02:09:37.183 --> 02:09:40.385]  And then they target reporters, chasing them into the neighborhoods.
[02:09:41.394 --> 02:09:49.277]  And they're on footage going up and, you know, throwing down and smashing the Al Jazeera camera crew, and then going into McDonald's in broad daylight.
[02:09:49.457 --> 02:09:50.057]  Who are you?
[02:09:50.077 --> 02:09:51.137]  Because they see press.
[02:09:51.157 --> 02:09:53.018]  They walk over with the Washington Post.
[02:09:53.198 --> 02:09:53.598]  Yeah!
[02:09:53.698 --> 02:09:54.679]  Slam their head in the wall.
[02:09:55.179 --> 02:09:56.559]  I mean, this is all on video.
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:58.300]  Who are you?
[02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:01.181]  I'm from the Washington Post.
[02:10:01.361 --> 02:10:02.021]  Yeah!
[02:10:02.381 --> 02:10:03.962]  And then, I mean, this is...
[02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:06.031]  What's going on?
[02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:17.419]  And now they're programming into all the new phones, globally, kill switches and kill switches in all your appliance and your car, all of it wired through the threat fusion centers that are the federalization centers.
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:21.462]  This has all been planned, folks, all been planned.
[02:10:21.502 --> 02:10:22.703]  I tell you, they want to start a civil war.
[02:10:22.763 --> 02:10:25.605]  Joining us for the hour is George Norrie.
[02:10:26.045 --> 02:10:27.586]  Doesn't need any introduction here.
[02:10:28.206 --> 02:10:31.349]  Second most syndicated radio host behind Rush Limbaugh in the country.
[02:10:32.551 --> 02:10:38.335]  Close to 600 AM and FM stations, XM, and he's even syndicated in places like Canada and Europe.
[02:10:38.995 --> 02:10:45.979]  Coast2CoastAM.com, BeyondBelief.com is his popular television show as well.
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:51.923]  And he, I mean I asked him to come on a few weeks ago and he said, yeah, I want to come on and talk about the initiative he's promoting.
[02:10:52.503 --> 02:10:53.624]  It's only a few billion dollars.
[02:10:53.664 --> 02:10:54.545]  We've talked about this as well.
[02:10:56.351 --> 02:11:08.638]  Harden the electrical grid so that an artificial or man-made EMP, solar flares or man-made EMP, will not knock us back to the Stone Age and make all the nuclear reactors melt down when they don't get power or diesel fuel.
[02:11:09.459 --> 02:11:11.780]  So we're going to talk about that, protecting the grid.
[02:11:12.901 --> 02:11:21.886]  That is one of the big issues that George Norrie has been covering and he's going to be talking more about that as well on his show.
[02:11:22.246 --> 02:11:25.308]  But first off, obviously George, you're from Michigan.
[02:11:26.283 --> 02:11:34.426]  Of course, we're in the Navy for a while before that, but your big start was in TV, won a bunch of television awards, won Emmys for that.
[02:11:34.786 --> 02:11:36.067]  But then you went into radio.
[02:11:36.127 --> 02:11:41.069]  I guess that's how you got your coast-to-coast gig 13 years ago or whatever it was.
[02:11:41.649 --> 02:11:43.790]  There being on the air out of St.
[02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:47.992]  Louis, you were known as the Nighthawk, I guess, with the number one rated show there.
[02:11:48.712 --> 02:12:04.202]  And so you know this area, you know what's happening, so I'm going to have to pick your brain first on this and some of the other issues before we get into the big enchilada with you, but George Norrie of Coast2CoastAM.com, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[02:12:05.003 --> 02:12:09.926]  Alex, my friend, good to be with you, and I am going to be in that area next week.
[02:12:09.986 --> 02:12:11.027]  I'm going back to St.
[02:12:11.067 --> 02:12:12.188]  Louis for three weeks.
[02:12:13.044 --> 02:12:16.125]  And I'm very familiar with the Ferguson area.
[02:12:17.246 --> 02:12:31.092]  It is a quaint neighborhood that right now is absolutely out of control with a police department that just doesn't understand how to handle this kind of situation.
[02:12:31.732 --> 02:12:34.013]  And that's why it's getting blown out of proportion.
[02:12:34.474 --> 02:12:35.894]  They can't handle the media.
[02:12:36.254 --> 02:12:37.595]  They can't handle the people.
[02:12:38.423 --> 02:12:41.066]  And they really just don't know what they're doing.
[02:12:41.367 --> 02:12:50.677]  We don't know what exactly happened between that police officer and the poor young man, Michael Brown, in that shooting episode.
[02:12:51.318 --> 02:12:55.422]  But the entire episode has now been blown out of proportion in two ways.
[02:12:55.502 --> 02:12:56.023]  Number one,
[02:12:57.085 --> 02:13:02.191]  There are a group of thugs who want to profit off anything that happens.
[02:13:02.771 --> 02:13:10.300]  I mean, so when you go to protest a truly sad story of a young man being shot to death by police,
[02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:19.573]  You don't go from brake stores and loot and steal and hit you stores with a number of cars showing up and a coordinated effort.
[02:13:20.154 --> 02:13:21.674]  So that's problem number one.
[02:13:22.274 --> 02:13:30.998]  Problem number two, the police out there, and they don't have this kind of crowd control experience, are absolutely uptight.
[02:13:31.838 --> 02:13:38.881]  And consequently, they are showing it in front of cameras, with media, with the people,
[02:13:39.904 --> 02:13:41.106]  And they need some help.
[02:13:41.386 --> 02:13:49.114]  I mean, we need to get some serious either National Guards in there to calm things down and to get this thing resolved.
[02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:56.182]  I was in Detroit during the early riots in the 60s and I saw that thing fester out of control and
[02:13:57.910 --> 02:14:01.432]  This is a little Ferguson, and I don't want to see the same thing happen.
[02:14:02.013 --> 02:14:09.438]  Not now, not in 2014, this is not 1960 again, and it's got to come down.
[02:14:09.698 --> 02:14:16.623]  Be that as it may, we also should be talking about the overly aggressive police forces in this country.
[02:14:17.676 --> 02:14:18.916]  Because they've got to slow down.
[02:14:19.316 --> 02:14:21.197]  And again, we don't know what happened here.
[02:14:21.217 --> 02:14:24.458]  You know, the officer apparently had some bruises.
[02:14:25.018 --> 02:14:25.878]  Something happened.
[02:14:25.918 --> 02:14:27.078]  There was an altercation.
[02:14:27.518 --> 02:14:39.721]  CNN had a witness, a young African-American woman, who saw a fight, a wrestling, with Michael Brown outside the police cruiser with a cop inside.
[02:14:40.261 --> 02:14:41.121]  We don't know what happened.
[02:14:41.841 --> 02:14:45.542]  And unfortunately, Ferguson doesn't have video cams on their cars.
[02:14:46.278 --> 02:14:48.159]  So we definitely can't see what happens.
[02:14:50.541 --> 02:14:51.622]  That's the best we know.
[02:14:53.103 --> 02:14:55.124]  In fact I may come up there next week.
[02:14:56.843 --> 02:15:04.044]  I know you do your show part of the time in L.A., part of the time literally from a cave complex there in St.
[02:15:04.104 --> 02:15:09.285]  Louis, and I've never seen that complex, so maybe we can hook up for dinner or something when I'm up there.
[02:15:09.305 --> 02:15:15.487]  I know I'm going to come on the TV show and see you in Denver in a few months, so that's finally going to happen.
[02:15:15.507 --> 02:15:16.947]  Look forward to doing that with you, George.
[02:15:17.627 --> 02:15:19.287]  But you are the expert on St.
[02:15:19.327 --> 02:15:22.868]  Louis, obviously living there for so long and still living there, having your main house
[02:15:23.388 --> 02:15:25.729]  There, so I'm glad we've got you there on the ground.
[02:15:25.769 --> 02:15:31.431]  Maybe you'll even go out there yourself and do some reporting like you used to do as a TV news producer.
[02:15:31.851 --> 02:15:49.517]  My issue is, what would you say from my perspective, we have the HD video, and we have our live stream video, that my reporters with camera flags and big cameras were shot with rubber bullets and chased and attacked, and it's on video of Al Jazeera, hundreds of yards away,
[02:15:51.155 --> 02:15:56.158]  Tear gas, rubber-bulleted, flash-banged, and then they chase them down and shoot them in the back with rubber bullets.
[02:15:56.658 --> 02:15:57.519]  I mean, that's criminal.
[02:15:58.639 --> 02:16:02.202]  And, I mean, as a news producer, did you ever hear of stuff like that?
[02:16:02.222 --> 02:16:06.244]  Because I followed news when I was a kid and been in the news for 20 years now.
[02:16:06.884 --> 02:16:09.826]  I've never covered something like this, and we've covered it before.
[02:16:10.206 --> 02:16:14.729]  Cops just ignore you and walk past you if you don't get right up in what they're doing.
[02:16:15.169 --> 02:16:19.532]  I've never seen police announce on loudspeakers, news media, turn your cameras off.
[02:16:20.134 --> 02:16:23.695]  No, see, they don't have the experience, and that's very sad.
[02:16:24.235 --> 02:16:25.296]  If this happened in St.
[02:16:25.356 --> 02:16:32.458]  Louis, that police department has a little more experience with this kind of a situation, and they would have handled it a little better.
[02:16:33.219 --> 02:16:41.781]  The Ferguson Police Department is a department of 50-plus officers, of which there are only three African-Americans, so it doesn't reflect the community.
[02:16:42.602 --> 02:16:46.103]  And they have no experience with media,
[02:16:46.761 --> 02:17:04.993]  With this kind of altercation situation, and it continues to fester out of control, and our president has got to get involved in this for a number of reasons and get this thing calmed down before it gets out of control.
[02:17:05.013 --> 02:17:10.136]  I mean, we're coming up on several days now, and I was listening to your reporter,
[02:17:11.343 --> 02:17:12.945]  I'm concerned about tonight as well.
[02:17:13.445 --> 02:17:22.196]  I mean, this is 22 minutes away from my house and where my kids are, and it's a tense situation.
[02:17:22.377 --> 02:17:24.880]  Again, Alex, it's magnified by two things.
[02:17:25.663 --> 02:17:29.465]  Inexperienced police, of which there are many good ones.
[02:17:29.645 --> 02:17:31.645]  I mean, I want to make that perfectly clear.
[02:17:31.665 --> 02:17:36.087]  They're out there doing their job, putting their lives on the line, trying to protect people.
[02:17:36.307 --> 02:17:39.768]  And you know, when there's a problem, we call the cops for help.
[02:17:40.209 --> 02:17:46.311]  So there's a lot of good ones out there, but they don't have the experience with this kind of massive crowd control.
[02:17:46.651 --> 02:17:51.393]  The other problem is, somebody is festering these young people
[02:17:52.136 --> 02:17:52.876]  They should go home.
[02:17:53.216 --> 02:18:01.700]  I mean, they have no business being out there screaming, chanting, the investigation into the death of Michael Brown will happen.
[02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:03.501]  It's not going to be a wash.
[02:18:03.961 --> 02:18:05.642]  We've got to find out what's going on.
[02:18:06.062 --> 02:18:12.765]  At this point, I absolutely endorse not releasing the name of the police officer until either one he's indicted.
[02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:15.726]  Or two, they've got some more information.
[02:18:16.407 --> 02:18:20.009]  Because I'm afraid the people will find out where he lives and go in there and kill the guy.
[02:18:20.689 --> 02:18:24.091]  And, again, we don't know what happened.
[02:18:24.371 --> 02:18:26.332]  Well, I agree with you on a lot of those issues.
[02:18:26.352 --> 02:18:28.613]  I mean, it's very balanced what you've said.
[02:18:29.434 --> 02:18:36.137]  My only problem is, I've seen the video of these police, and a bunch of them are state troopers that have come in.
[02:18:36.658 --> 02:18:37.398]  They're aiming M4
[02:18:39.119 --> 02:18:46.675]  M16s at Josh Owens, my reporter, who's holding a big professional camera with a press badge and pointing it at him with a laser.
[02:18:47.708 --> 02:18:48.689]  Yeah, they're insane.
[02:18:48.729 --> 02:18:51.390]  They don't understand what they're doing.
[02:18:51.451 --> 02:18:55.613]  They think we're back in Iraq or Syria or someplace like that.
[02:18:55.633 --> 02:18:56.614]  Well, sure, that's what I'm saying.
[02:18:56.694 --> 02:18:58.035]  Yeah, the kids should go home.
[02:18:58.535 --> 02:18:59.876]  It's not helping what's happening.
[02:18:59.936 --> 02:19:01.317]  It's a dangerous situation.
[02:19:01.677 --> 02:19:07.681]  But the instinct is don't back down when people are aiming lasers at you and attacking the press.
[02:19:08.282 --> 02:19:09.262]  So what I'm saying is...
[02:19:10.123 --> 02:19:12.924]  The system is losing the moral high ground here.
[02:19:13.284 --> 02:19:14.304]  I don't want to see riots.
[02:19:14.424 --> 02:19:15.625]  I don't want to see martial law.
[02:19:15.985 --> 02:19:17.625]  I don't want to see this spread across the country.
[02:19:17.945 --> 02:19:19.386]  I don't want to see the cops look bad.
[02:19:19.626 --> 02:19:20.946]  We're all Americans, George.
[02:19:21.667 --> 02:19:26.588]  But this is really... My gut tells me this is about to get a lot worse, and I'm really concerned.
[02:19:26.608 --> 02:19:28.789]  Do you have any ideas how we could de-escalate this?
[02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:31.431]  Well, let's hope it doesn't get worse.
[02:19:31.491 --> 02:19:33.833]  I think the community leaders have got to step in.
[02:19:34.213 --> 02:19:40.619]  The parents have got to step in and go up to their kids and say, get the heck off the street.
[02:19:41.179 --> 02:19:41.880]  Get out of there.
[02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:42.941]  You're not going to be there.
[02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:44.122]  Let's not fester this.
[02:19:44.602 --> 02:19:46.964]  Let's let the investigation follow.
[02:19:47.444 --> 02:19:49.826]  Let's get some real bonafide witnesses.
[02:19:49.866 --> 02:19:53.830]  I mean, that's a concern for me, too, that these witnesses are legit.
[02:19:54.330 --> 02:19:59.757]  Or, you know, are they making things up to try to literally get this cop indicted?
[02:20:00.358 --> 02:20:03.062]  Again, we don't know what happened.
[02:20:03.322 --> 02:20:03.763]  Exactly.
[02:20:03.783 --> 02:20:07.468]  And we don't need a bunch of stuff burning down our... George Norris is our guest.
[02:20:07.488 --> 02:20:09.410]  We're going to come back and talk about some key issues.
[02:20:09.430 --> 02:20:09.791]  Stay with us.
[02:20:10.311 --> 02:20:12.892]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:20:13.032 --> 02:20:17.033]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:20:17.333 --> 02:20:18.554]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:18.734 --> 02:20:21.215]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:20:21.395 --> 02:20:24.196]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:20:24.396 --> 02:20:26.537]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[02:20:26.757 --> 02:20:28.497]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:20:28.657 --> 02:20:33.979]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:20:34.219 --> 02:20:37.900]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:39.521]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:40.001 --> 02:20:40.821]  This is an alert.
[02:20:41.102 --> 02:20:45.063]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[02:20:45.203 --> 02:20:49.265]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[02:20:49.385 --> 02:20:54.688]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.
[02:20:54.788 --> 02:20:58.209]  And we're offering rebates of up to $20,000 to help you build today.
[02:20:58.309 --> 02:21:01.350]  Call General Steel for free information that could save you thousands.

[02:21:02.251 --> 02:21:02.571]  That's 866-917-8335.
[02:21:09.474 --> 02:21:16.601]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:18.863]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:21:19.043 --> 02:21:24.208]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:21:24.368 --> 02:21:29.453]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:21:29.553 --> 02:21:32.636]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:21:32.936 --> 02:21:36.797]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:21:37.017 --> 02:21:41.299]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:21:41.399 --> 02:21:51.442]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:21:51.682 --> 02:21:56.003]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[02:21:56.123 --> 02:22:02.525]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[02:22:10.345 --> 02:22:11.906]  Time and time again.
[02:22:11.926 --> 02:22:14.768]  You need to come here and help us.
[02:22:14.888 --> 02:22:15.949]  We need assistance.
[02:22:16.329 --> 02:22:16.870]  Please!
[02:22:17.130 --> 02:22:20.433]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[02:22:20.713 --> 02:22:26.877]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:22:27.117 --> 02:22:29.519]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[02:22:29.639 --> 02:22:33.222]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.

[02:22:52.645 --> 02:22:56.688]  We are hurting down here and we need help immediately.
[02:22:56.808 --> 02:23:01.170]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.

[02:23:09.266 --> 02:23:10.126]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:23:10.286 --> 02:23:15.609]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:23:15.809 --> 02:23:16.229]  I get it.
[02:23:16.369 --> 02:23:25.713]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:23:25.953 --> 02:23:27.133]  That's not what's happening.
[02:23:27.333 --> 02:23:35.557]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:23:35.797 --> 02:23:39.038]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:23:39.158 --> 02:23:43.219]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:44.980]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:48.221]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:23:48.962 --> 02:23:52.563]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:23:52.763 --> 02:23:53.463]  You should, too.
[02:23:53.663 --> 02:23:54.624]  Find out what they know.
[02:23:54.804 --> 02:23:58.085]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:23:58.105 --> 02:23:58.145]  800-686-2237.
[02:23:58.165 --> 02:23:58.445]  800-686-2237.
[02:23:58.505 --> 02:23:58.685]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:24:11.032 --> 02:24:11.516]  We're good.
[02:24:32.045 --> 02:24:34.586]  Alright, I want to shift gears into solar flares.
[02:24:35.646 --> 02:24:56.931]  Mainline congressional studies, we've had expert guests on covering this, and George will break it down because he's really tried to put a national focus on it more than anybody, have testified that we know, repeatedly in the last 150 years, we've been hit by the equivalent of EMPs from the sun that melted all the telegraph wires in the United States and things like that.
[02:24:57.371 --> 02:25:00.292]  If we get hit with one of those now, it's over.
[02:25:01.414 --> 02:25:07.199]  So we're going to talk about some real threats here that don't include the American people according to Homeland Security with George Norrie.
[02:25:07.519 --> 02:25:11.343]  But George, in this short segment I wanted to get back to what's going to happen
[02:25:12.438 --> 02:25:21.783]  If some crazies or other people get sick of what the police are doing aiming guns at folks, they show up with guns and then the police shoot at them or they shoot back.
[02:25:22.183 --> 02:25:24.104]  We could have a Kent State kickoff here.
[02:25:24.464 --> 02:25:26.405]  This country's a powder keg right now.
[02:25:26.946 --> 02:25:28.246]  That's my concern.
[02:25:28.947 --> 02:25:35.890]  That a lot of people, if you aim a gun at them for no reason, like happened to our Josh Owens reporter, people are going to respond back to that.
[02:25:36.711 --> 02:25:38.632]  And I'm just really concerned
[02:25:39.832 --> 02:25:41.753]  And again, I wonder, what are the state police thinking?
[02:25:41.833 --> 02:25:43.474]  What are the Ferguson police chief thinking?
[02:25:43.814 --> 02:25:52.058]  He did a press conference about an hour ago, I saw a clip of, where they said, why are your people shooting reporters and aiming guns and lasers at reporters' heads?
[02:25:52.098 --> 02:25:53.558]  And he goes, that's technical.
[02:25:53.878 --> 02:25:55.159]  That's not my responsibility.
[02:25:55.339 --> 02:25:56.420]  Well, he's the police chief.
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:59.141]  He's just washing his hands, playing dumb.
[02:25:59.401 --> 02:26:03.142]  He didn't know when reporters were arrested when he got asked last night about that.
[02:26:04.083 --> 02:26:05.624]  I mean, so I think you're right.
[02:26:07.004 --> 02:26:08.165]  And the feds are involved.
[02:26:09.707 --> 02:26:10.688]  This looks bad, George.
[02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:14.990]  What happens if, let's say, 15 people get shot, 5 of them die?
[02:26:15.570 --> 02:26:17.791]  I think all hell's gonna break loose nationwide.
[02:26:19.172 --> 02:26:20.753]  Well, it could be a serious problem.
[02:26:20.973 --> 02:26:26.536]  And, uh, you know, people, and I've been talking about this on Coast to Coast, Alex, for about a year and a half now.
[02:26:27.076 --> 02:26:28.037]  People are a pipe.
[02:26:28.497 --> 02:26:30.258]  I mean, they're wound up like springs.
[02:26:30.838 --> 02:26:34.080]  And anything could be a catalyst to explode that.
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:43.005]  And I'm concerned, too, that some thugs show up with guns, playing the part of, you know, posse cop coming to pot us.
[02:26:44.006 --> 02:26:48.208]  And they're going to go ahead and start shooting at the cops, and the cops are going to shoot back.
[02:26:48.628 --> 02:26:50.089]  They're going to hit innocent people.
[02:26:50.689 --> 02:26:52.771]  It's going to be a disaster.
[02:26:53.131 --> 02:27:01.776]  So I hope they can get those streets cleared and get people to go home and get on to their lives and let this investigation
[02:27:02.702 --> 02:27:04.844]  Go and follow its course.
[02:27:05.104 --> 02:27:12.690]  I mean, I trust the prosecution out there, and I think they'll do the best they can to find out what's going on.
[02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:20.576]  And, you know, they've been sitting down with this police officer saying, what the heck were you doing shooting an unarmed man?
[02:27:20.596 --> 02:27:23.739]  And I'm sure he's saying, wait a minute, the guy did this.
[02:27:23.799 --> 02:27:25.140]  He tried to pull my gun.
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:29.063]  You know, he reached into the car and all those things could be possible.
[02:27:29.183 --> 02:27:30.124]  We don't know that.
[02:27:30.774 --> 02:27:34.880]  Bottom line is, he made a mistake as the kid was running away.
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:36.602]  He should not have shot him.
[02:27:37.083 --> 02:27:40.207]  It was a fatal mistake in more ways than one.
[02:27:40.908 --> 02:27:43.071]  And I'm concerned about it too, Alex.
[02:27:43.191 --> 02:27:45.394]  I mean, if some thugs show up with guns...
[02:27:46.295 --> 02:27:47.116]  That's what they are.
[02:27:47.676 --> 02:27:50.619]  And start playing the part of, you know, they're the vigilantes here.
[02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:53.101]  It's going to get out of control.
[02:27:53.342 --> 02:27:59.707]  And once a lot of innocent people get shot, we're going to have a very serious situation.
[02:28:00.088 --> 02:28:01.309]  But I've been through this before.
[02:28:01.609 --> 02:28:02.610]  I've seen this happen.
[02:28:03.747 --> 02:28:05.409]  Eventually it does calm down.
[02:28:05.489 --> 02:28:06.770]  People do slow down.
[02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:18.544]  They simply say, okay, but what this does, and this should be a major focus across the country, is that we've got to back down on police force.
[02:28:19.105 --> 02:28:22.969]  These guys have got to understand they are not gods.
[02:28:23.810 --> 02:28:28.535]  And they've got to follow the law, and some of them don't!
[02:28:29.035 --> 02:28:41.047]  I mean, they push people around, they, you know... Well, reportedly, this police officer saw Michael Brown and a friend of his walking down the street, and, you know, he said the F-word, get out of the street, what are you guys doing?
[02:28:41.127 --> 02:28:43.049]  And things got out of control.
[02:28:44.733 --> 02:28:48.035]  Cops have got to get back to the point and say, hey, you know what?
[02:28:48.095 --> 02:28:49.215]  We're police officers.
[02:28:49.275 --> 02:28:50.256]  We're here to defend.
[02:28:50.316 --> 02:28:52.057]  We're here to take care of people.
[02:28:52.417 --> 02:28:57.220]  We've got to stop this stupid stuff we're doing around the country, these checkpoints.
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:01.002]  I mean, my God, it's like we're in Nazi Germany.
[02:29:01.182 --> 02:29:03.023]  I was at a checkpoint in St.
[02:29:03.063 --> 02:29:07.865]  Louis at 3 o'clock in the morning after one of my shows.
[02:29:10.371 --> 02:29:13.153]  You know, you feel like you're back in Nazi Germany.
[02:29:13.213 --> 02:29:18.158]  I mean, what right do they have to stop you when you haven't done anything wrong yet?
[02:29:18.919 --> 02:29:24.624]  And, you know, they ask you these certain questions and you feel like you're guilty before you do anything.
[02:29:25.330 --> 02:29:26.150]  That's got to stop.
[02:29:26.170 --> 02:29:34.334]  We need to do a national review of our police force and to get them to stop doing what they've been doing.
[02:29:34.354 --> 02:29:36.996]  Well, the elite want a force that'll suppress the public.
[02:29:37.136 --> 02:29:40.117]  Instead, it's going to make the public revolt.
[02:29:40.698 --> 02:29:43.259]  And no amount of police state's ever going to stop the American people.
[02:29:43.579 --> 02:29:45.380]  Our whole military couldn't even hold Baghdad.
[02:29:46.666 --> 02:29:46.706]  No.
[02:29:46.727 --> 02:29:47.227]  And you can't.
[02:29:47.327 --> 02:29:56.936]  And police departments, as this shows, are not trained to handle massive crowd control and it's unfortunate.
[02:29:56.976 --> 02:29:57.457]  That's right.
[02:29:57.497 --> 02:29:58.638]  George Norrie is our guest.
[02:29:58.858 --> 02:29:59.258]  Stay with us.
[02:29:59.278 --> 02:29:59.579]  We'll be back.
[02:29:59.599 --> 02:30:00.199]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.239 --> 02:30:01.941]  We'll get into EMP straight ahead.
[02:30:02.081 --> 02:30:03.182]  Really important information.
[02:30:03.202 --> 02:30:06.025]  Alex Jones and the JCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.479 --> 02:30:14.222]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:30:14.302 --> 02:30:15.503]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[02:30:15.543 --> 02:30:16.624]  God knows what's in this.
[02:30:16.864 --> 02:30:20.947]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:30:21.107 --> 02:30:26.891]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:30:27.031 --> 02:30:28.032]  That one is better.
[02:30:28.072 --> 02:30:29.052]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:30:29.333 --> 02:30:30.754]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:30:30.794 --> 02:30:31.274]  It's good water.
[02:30:31.394 --> 02:30:37.139]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:30:37.359 --> 02:30:44.425]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:30:44.605 --> 02:30:47.127]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:30:47.327 --> 02:30:55.254]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:30:55.374 --> 02:30:56.375]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:30:56.535 --> 02:30:57.416]  It's good water.
[02:30:57.616 --> 02:30:58.036]  Refreshing?
[02:30:58.056 --> 02:30:58.517]  It's good!

[02:31:10.487 --> 02:31:20.633]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:31:21.093 --> 02:31:27.517]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:31:27.577 --> 02:31:29.839]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:31:29.939 --> 02:31:33.001]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.

[02:31:40.405 --> 02:31:43.926]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:44.066 --> 02:31:48.028]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:48.348 --> 02:31:49.809]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:50.129 --> 02:31:57.712]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:31:57.992 --> 02:31:58.832]  But for how long?
[02:31:59.132 --> 02:32:05.395]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:32:05.775 --> 02:32:08.576]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:32:10.211 --> 02:32:12.432]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:32:27.921 --> 02:32:37.872]  We are doing this special to draw attention to the brainwashing that's taking place in the media and in the public schools and in many of the private schools and the quote higher levels of education.
[02:32:38.173 --> 02:32:41.957]  Infowars.com is right at the tip of the spear worldwide.
[02:32:42.177 --> 02:32:42.858]  That's why it's a
[02:32:42.858 --> 02:32:43.238]  Thank you.
[02:33:21.798 --> 02:33:25.659]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[02:33:26.159 --> 02:33:30.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:35.442 --> 02:33:37.003]  Riders on the storm.
[02:33:37.863 --> 02:33:38.383]  Big time.
[02:33:41.155 --> 02:33:45.617]  Pray for Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, and Josh Owens.
[02:33:46.377 --> 02:33:49.559]  Three of our reporters up in Ferguson.
[02:33:49.879 --> 02:33:59.103]  They're having to go out and eat right now because at three o'clock they closed the major roads that even go back into the neighborhood.
[02:34:00.744 --> 02:34:01.525]  It's a big area.
[02:34:03.025 --> 02:34:03.806]  Thousands of people.
[02:34:05.566 --> 02:34:06.367]  Very, very sad.
[02:34:07.930 --> 02:34:28.537]  And so our reporters are out there really in 100 and something degree heat, being shot at and marked at by a bunch of guys that think the image of power and masculinity and pointing guns at people is going to make them submit when they've stepped way out of bounds and are escalating this quickly.
[02:34:28.877 --> 02:34:33.979]  Going into McDonald's and saying to the Washington Post, why are you taking a picture of me?
[02:34:34.039 --> 02:34:34.859]  I'm going to arrest you.
[02:34:36.694 --> 02:34:38.285]  Anybody say power trip?
[02:34:41.155 --> 02:34:42.476]  Anybody say North Korea?
[02:34:42.536 --> 02:34:44.156]  We're going back to George Noria here in a moment.
[02:34:44.837 --> 02:34:48.138]  Don't forget, this hour is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com.
[02:34:48.498 --> 02:34:50.779]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:34:51.259 --> 02:34:55.121]  Wonderful high quality, very inexpensive, non-GMO storable foods.
[02:34:55.481 --> 02:34:56.542]  Great customer service.
[02:34:56.842 --> 02:35:01.404]  They have unique plastic tote containers that the meals are kept in.
[02:35:01.804 --> 02:35:05.525]  Just the containers themselves, you know, you buy at Home Depot for like 50 bucks a piece.
[02:35:05.565 --> 02:35:06.446]  I don't know how they do this.
[02:35:06.866 --> 02:35:11.627]  I mean, such nice packaging, everything, mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:35:12.127 --> 02:35:18.488]  Government stores food, I store food, I think you should store food, this is the place, mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:35:19.049 --> 02:35:30.191]  And please don't forget, this whole platform, and the synergy with the George Norris and the James O'Keefe's and all the other great real media that's out there, that is so diverse,
[02:35:31.283 --> 02:35:51.259]  Is funded by people like you going to Veritas Project and checking out their products and buying O'Keefe's book and clicking on the banners and going to coasttocoastam.com and going and subscribing to George Norrie's excellently produced TV show that covers every topic you can imagine at beyondbelief.com.
[02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:53.001]  That's beyondbelief.com.
[02:35:53.541 --> 02:35:55.483]  We don't have the big globalist funding.
[02:35:56.864 --> 02:35:57.945]  I know I certainly don't.
[02:35:59.318 --> 02:36:03.020]  And that's how we're building a true independent media operation.
[02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:03.820]  Take George Norring.
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:05.862]  Been interviewing me since 2002, 2003.
[02:36:05.922 --> 02:36:07.022]  12, 13 years.
[02:36:07.062 --> 02:36:09.784]  Nobody back then in big radio would interview me.
[02:36:17.192 --> 02:36:22.358]  I was already breaking through, reaching a lot of people, but I tell you, he helped launch InfoWars at so many levels.
[02:36:22.738 --> 02:36:31.106]  And that's why I enjoy his show and also just really care about George, who is there to build people up and support free speech.
[02:36:32.628 --> 02:36:35.090]  And that's why it's so important to subscribe to his
[02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:41.704]  And to visit his website, beyondbelief.com.
[02:36:42.084 --> 02:36:44.546]  That's why it's so important to tell folks about Coast to Coast AM.
[02:36:44.847 --> 02:36:47.549]  And it doesn't mean you even have to agree with every guest he's got on.
[02:36:48.090 --> 02:36:50.752]  He doesn't agree with me on everything, I don't agree with him on everything, just like Jesse Ventura.
[02:36:51.073 --> 02:36:59.280]  The point is we agree on freedom and free speech and having a strong family and a right to self-defense and that there are globalists
[02:37:00.057 --> 02:37:03.680]  At the top of things, playing humanity off against each other.
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:06.682]  So please go to Infowarslife.com today.
[02:37:07.282 --> 02:37:09.384]  Buy the X2 nascent iodine.

[02:37:20.568 --> 02:37:30.780]  I'm still running all the specials at Infowarslife.com with a blanket 10% off everything with promo code 10 at checkout.
[02:37:31.020 --> 02:37:32.422]  That only runs till Monday.
[02:37:32.862 --> 02:37:35.745]  It's back to government re-education camp special.
[02:37:36.906 --> 02:37:38.167]  Everybody has a back to school special.
[02:37:38.207 --> 02:37:41.169]  Well, here's our Pink Floyd no more education special.
[02:37:41.209 --> 02:37:43.711]  That means no more edumacation or brainwashing.
[02:37:43.971 --> 02:37:45.372]  Promo code 1-0.
[02:37:45.873 --> 02:37:46.833]  Common Core doesn't work.
[02:37:46.873 --> 02:37:47.774]  Can't put in 9 or 11.
[02:37:48.755 --> 02:37:49.235]  Can't put in 8.
[02:37:49.655 --> 02:37:50.656]  Can't put in 14.
[02:37:50.696 --> 02:37:52.317]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:37:52.678 --> 02:37:54.359]  The promo code is 1-0.
[02:37:55.159 --> 02:37:56.080]  10% off everything.
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.881]  Stuff that's even already discounted.
[02:37:58.182 --> 02:37:59.323]  It runs till next Monday.
[02:38:00.523 --> 02:38:05.448]  You also support the broadcast going to PrisonPlanet.tv and getting a subscription.
[02:38:05.869 --> 02:38:16.200]  Each subscription, $5.95 a month, 11 people can use the username and passcode to then be able to let their friends and family watch.
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:18.842]  And by the way, George didn't ask me to plug this when he came on.
[02:38:19.183 --> 02:38:19.803]  I'm gonna do it!
[02:38:20.524 --> 02:38:23.326]  We shouldn't be ashamed to try to build our own media operations.
[02:38:23.787 --> 02:38:26.068]  We shouldn't be ashamed to ask for support.
[02:38:26.308 --> 02:38:40.719]  We don't take money like MSNBC from taxpayers and stimulus money, or $400 million a year like NPR of taxpayer money, or ABC News that gets banker bailout money from George Soros and Warren Buffett to underwrite their shows.
[02:38:41.139 --> 02:38:42.420]  We have to get it from you.
[02:38:43.021 --> 02:38:43.962]  And if you want to see
[02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:48.705]  More hardcore guests, more reporters, more info.
[02:38:49.165 --> 02:38:53.428]  You've got to support our AM and FM affiliates, support their sponsors, become a sponsor.
[02:38:53.628 --> 02:38:55.209]  You've got to spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:38:55.450 --> 02:39:01.454]  You've got to go to Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and you've got to buy the great products that are already the lowest price.
[02:39:01.774 --> 02:39:02.615]  It's a win-win-win.
[02:39:03.075 --> 02:39:03.456]  George!
[02:39:04.477 --> 02:39:06.078]  I love watching your show online.
[02:39:06.138 --> 02:39:08.640]  I have a subscription at beyondbelief.com.
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:17.246]  But when I get that subscription that's so inexpensive, it opens up to just hundreds of other shows that are on this network that you're part of.
[02:39:18.006 --> 02:39:22.489]  And it's just so exciting to see this growing and becoming so popular.
[02:39:22.789 --> 02:39:26.392]  So tell us how people subscribe to your show and get the hundreds of other shows.
[02:39:27.037 --> 02:39:38.724]  It's like Netflix, Alex, where for a minimal little monthly fee, you get all the programs and you can watch them as often as you can.
[02:39:38.744 --> 02:39:48.149]  And technologically now, with Google Chrome and everything else, you can watch anything from your computer on your flat screen TV.
[02:39:48.329 --> 02:39:52.892]  I mean, it is real television in real time, and it's up there for you.
[02:39:52.952 --> 02:39:54.433]  But at beyondbelief.com,
[02:39:55.111 --> 02:40:10.187]  We have our main television program, Beyond Belief, of which you're going to be on soon, and we've got great guests that come on, but you have access to all the other different programs that are produced by the Gaian Television Network.
[02:40:10.914 --> 02:40:18.581]  And I've never seen anything like it before, but it's in an era of information and cost and affordability.
[02:40:19.141 --> 02:40:31.071]  It's just something where people can just sit back in the comfort of their home, the one domicile they still have, and relax and watch some quality programming and get information from it.
[02:40:31.630 --> 02:40:34.813]  You know, it's not just a Hollywood piece of good video.
[02:40:34.954 --> 02:40:39.198]  You actually watch it, learn from it, and you plan your life with it.
[02:40:39.338 --> 02:40:44.544]  Well, look, I mean, the best stuff out there, George, is not on mainline cable.
[02:40:44.944 --> 02:40:45.985]  It is in subscription.
[02:40:46.025 --> 02:40:51.291]  Now, PrisonPlanet.tv, it's on Roku and Boxee and all those systems as well.
[02:40:51.651 --> 02:40:53.653]  I find myself now, when I go on my cable,
[02:40:55.054 --> 02:40:55.675]  I have cable now.
[02:40:55.695 --> 02:40:56.215]  I had satellite.
[02:40:56.235 --> 02:40:56.835]  It didn't work good.
[02:40:57.455 --> 02:41:01.057]  When I go on there, I'm going in to see your show.
[02:41:01.157 --> 02:41:02.278]  I'm going in to see mine.
[02:41:02.638 --> 02:41:04.059]  I'm going in to my subscriptions.
[02:41:04.519 --> 02:41:07.480]  Because it's not that I'm going to subscribe to what I want to hear.
[02:41:07.881 --> 02:41:10.822]  I see a lot of stuff on your show or other shows that I don't even agree with.
[02:41:11.062 --> 02:41:12.963]  Just like people hear stuff here they don't agree with.
[02:41:13.243 --> 02:41:14.964]  But it's not censored.
[02:41:15.324 --> 02:41:16.845]  It's not centralized.
[02:41:17.105 --> 02:41:18.486]  You tune into mainstream stuff.
[02:41:18.586 --> 02:41:22.587]  It is just so homogenized, so establishment.
[02:41:22.888 --> 02:41:25.889]  That's why they're collapsing and we're exploding.
[02:41:26.769 --> 02:41:27.249]  Exactly.
[02:41:27.489 --> 02:41:28.630]  It's all cookie cutter.
[02:41:28.850 --> 02:41:29.330]  We're not.
[02:41:29.790 --> 02:41:30.331]  You're not.
[02:41:30.891 --> 02:41:31.991]  And the public knows that.
[02:41:32.252 --> 02:41:33.732]  And they're going to get the truth.
[02:41:33.792 --> 02:41:34.793]  They're going to get opinion.
[02:41:35.213 --> 02:41:43.536]  Like you said earlier, hey, people might listen to a guest on Coast to Coast or Beyond Belief or InfoWars and not agree with that guest.
[02:41:44.117 --> 02:41:44.797]  But you know what?
[02:41:45.453 --> 02:41:47.375]  That's the success of the program.
[02:41:47.435 --> 02:41:52.660]  It gives you the right to decide what you want, whether you agree with it or not.
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:57.065]  You know, real debate, real information, and that's what it's all about.
[02:41:58.326 --> 02:41:58.907]  It really is.
[02:41:58.947 --> 02:42:00.188]  We report, you decide.
[02:42:00.708 --> 02:42:01.769]  It's not cookie cutter.
[02:42:02.330 --> 02:42:06.354]  And then sometimes I start a show with one opinion, and by the end I've had my mind changed.
[02:42:06.394 --> 02:42:06.854]  It's really
[02:42:07.904 --> 02:42:09.304]  It's interactive.
[02:42:09.905 --> 02:42:17.666]  That's what this is really all about, and that's why there's a revolution to shut down and censor InfoWars and Drudge and so many others.
[02:42:17.686 --> 02:42:22.588]  There's a move to bring the Fairness Doctrine back into talk radio and restrict what George and I can say.
[02:42:22.608 --> 02:42:25.508]  I mean, there's only three hosts that have other hosts on.
[02:42:25.548 --> 02:42:27.449]  That's Michael Savage, George Norrie, Alex Jones.
[02:42:27.889 --> 02:42:35.291]  The other big hosts are really in it purely as political operatives or for themselves, and I'm not even attacking them.
[02:42:36.522 --> 02:42:37.504]  It's just a fact.
[02:42:38.145 --> 02:42:40.969]  I know George well now over 12, 13 years.
[02:42:41.330 --> 02:42:43.213]  We really do want to live in a free country.
[02:42:43.554 --> 02:42:48.502]  We really are thrilled by learning stuff and talking about things.
[02:42:50.134 --> 02:43:07.356]  The reason I bring that up is voting with your dollars and your time and your mouth and your keyboard telling people about the media you listen to and where you found truth and where you found depth and breadth in the analysis where it's full spectrum.
[02:43:08.317 --> 02:43:09.818]  That's the fight happening.
[02:43:09.898 --> 02:43:11.339]  They're trying to suppress it.
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:14.022]  The system is afraid of a real press.
[02:43:14.122 --> 02:43:15.122]  We are the real press.
[02:43:15.543 --> 02:43:18.645]  So what I'm saying is, water the real press, folks.
[02:43:18.885 --> 02:43:19.786]  You've been doing it.
[02:43:20.186 --> 02:43:21.087]  Do it even more.
[02:43:21.487 --> 02:43:23.289]  And celebrate the real free press.
[02:43:23.869 --> 02:43:36.275]  Celebrate a Matt Drudge, or a George Norrie, or a Joseph Farah, or an Alex Jones, or a James O'Keefe, or the countless Celebrate a Jakari Jackson, or a Joe Biggs, out there getting shot with rubber bullets.
[02:43:36.795 --> 02:43:40.997]  I mean, these are the real warriors, not the guy playing football.
[02:43:41.317 --> 02:43:46.660]  And I can watch a football game, you know, at a family reunion and sit back and eat pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:49.322]  I'm not knocking it, it's just that's not my heroes.
[02:43:49.662 --> 02:44:00.208]  I don't get excited and jump up and down about some football game or about the World Cup, even though I could watch some of it and found it interesting, you know, in some of the final matches.
[02:44:00.748 --> 02:44:05.791]  It's just that that isn't what gets my blood flowing because it doesn't matter in the final equation.
[02:44:05.991 --> 02:44:07.112]  Here I am ranting, George.
[02:44:07.152 --> 02:44:07.672]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:44:08.764 --> 02:44:23.498]  By the way, you got a great compliment on my show last night from my guest Lionel, former radio broadcaster, complimenting you and Paul Joseph Watson for the work that you both do on your program.
[02:44:23.619 --> 02:44:25.901]  He has gone to bat.
[02:44:26.542 --> 02:44:32.724]  Defending messages from you and I don't know, have you had him on the program?
[02:44:32.764 --> 02:44:33.324]  Yes, I have.
[02:44:33.644 --> 02:44:35.125]  I met him at a talkers conference.
[02:44:35.525 --> 02:44:39.386]  He's got a show there on New York TV and just a great guy.
[02:44:39.446 --> 02:44:44.948]  Keith Oberman attacked him for just promoting basic freedom, which is sad for Keith Oberman.
[02:44:44.968 --> 02:44:47.829]  I mean, he's done some pretty journalistic stuff back in his day.
[02:44:48.277 --> 02:44:50.879]  Yeah, something's happened to him too, so I don't understand.
[02:44:52.141 --> 02:44:57.786]  I know you don't have a lot of time here, but my campaign to insulate the power... No, no, no.
[02:44:57.946 --> 02:44:59.227]  In fact, I apologize.
[02:44:59.267 --> 02:45:00.408]  I've hogged the whole interview.
[02:45:00.668 --> 02:45:01.589]  You've got the floor.
[02:45:01.829 --> 02:45:03.651]  Tell us about how big this is, George.
[02:45:04.052 --> 02:45:05.032]  This is huge.
[02:45:05.413 --> 02:45:06.073]  This is huge.
[02:45:06.113 --> 02:45:10.758]  And let me tell you why I decided to make this a national campaign.
[02:45:11.418 --> 02:45:24.544]  Because programs like yours and programs like mine, if something happens to the power grid, not only will millions of people eventually die, and I'll tell you how, but you're off the air.
[02:45:25.084 --> 02:45:25.844]  I'm off the air.
[02:45:26.045 --> 02:45:27.585]  The message stops.
[02:45:28.286 --> 02:45:30.787]  And we cannot afford that to happen.
[02:45:31.187 --> 02:45:36.789]  Now, there are some out there who may want that to happen, and that's part of the issue that I continue to battle.
[02:45:37.209 --> 02:45:39.510]  I had two guests on over the last several years.
[02:45:41.306 --> 02:45:48.050]  Michael Maloof, who wrote the book, A Nation Forsaken, and William Forsgen, who wrote the book One Second After.
[02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:52.353]  There are two distinct possibilities to shut down our power grid.
[02:45:52.673 --> 02:45:55.475]  One is a major X-Flare from the sun.
[02:45:55.795 --> 02:45:57.736]  We dodged one two years ago.
[02:45:58.256 --> 02:45:59.757]  It went off the side of the sun.
[02:45:59.797 --> 02:46:04.120]  Had it been a direct hit with us, we would have been cooked, according to scientists.
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:06.421]  The other is an EMP attack.
[02:46:06.902 --> 02:46:13.966]  A nation that gets a nuke and decides, we're not going to blow up New York or Wichita or Chicago.
[02:46:13.986 --> 02:46:27.335]  We're going to detonate a nuke in the atmosphere above the United States and that electromagnetic pulse will be strong enough to shut down the power grid of the United States for years.
[02:46:28.716 --> 02:46:31.737]  Without power, everything shuts down.
[02:46:31.897 --> 02:46:43.360]  And George, I mean, I know the EMP is somewhat of a threat or a hack attack as well, but for me, statistically, and reading the books and having the experts on and listening to you, because I know you cover this a lot more than I do, isn't it really the sun?
[02:46:43.380 --> 02:46:55.703]  I mean, we know the Earth got hit in the last 120 years multiple times by coronal mass ejections that did melt all the electronics, but then there was so little electronics it didn't do much.
[02:46:56.388 --> 02:46:57.910]  It's not if, it's when.
[02:46:58.410 --> 02:46:59.731]  It's going to happen.
[02:47:00.212 --> 02:47:12.504]  And if it happens and we don't spend the chump change, one to four billion dollars to insulate this, and we can with circuit breakers and everything else, we are literally fried.
[02:47:12.884 --> 02:47:14.826]  People think, okay, I'm going to go to my faucet.
[02:47:14.846 --> 02:47:15.326]  That's okay.
[02:47:15.406 --> 02:47:16.668]  Paul will be out for a month or two.
[02:47:16.728 --> 02:47:18.590]  No, it'll be out for years.
[02:47:19.050 --> 02:47:19.871]  And then they may say,
[02:47:20.291 --> 02:47:23.434]  Well, you know what, I'll just, you know, stay in my house in the winter.
[02:47:23.454 --> 02:47:24.495]  No, no, no, no.
[02:47:24.595 --> 02:47:25.916]  Your furnace doesn't work.
[02:47:26.276 --> 02:47:27.217]  You have no heat.
[02:47:27.757 --> 02:47:35.483]  You try to go get water, the company that pumps the water to your house won't have the capability of doing that anymore.
[02:47:35.904 --> 02:47:40.728]  You can't go to the ATM and get your money out because that's not working anymore.
[02:47:41.228 --> 02:47:42.349]  It will be chaos.
[02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:44.671]  What's happening in Ferguson, Missouri right now,
[02:47:45.371 --> 02:47:53.560]  Is nothing compared to what will happen if an ex-flare or an EMP shuts down the power grid of the United States.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:04.291]  And the bottom line is, nobody will hear Alex Jones, nobody will hear George Norie, there will be no messages, your cell phones won't work, nothing will work.
[02:48:04.531 --> 02:48:06.552]  Tell folks what a Carrington event is.
[02:48:07.012 --> 02:48:12.033]  And historically, we've been hit by these, they think, every 100, 150 years or so.
[02:48:12.573 --> 02:48:16.674]  I mean, this is just so frightening to know that it's not a question of if, but when.
[02:48:17.054 --> 02:48:20.635]  And I've seen congressional testimony on C-SPAN that I know you've covered.
[02:48:20.955 --> 02:48:24.916]  But then when I talk about this, I get emails saying, Alex, why are you scaring people?
[02:48:25.196 --> 02:48:27.877]  We're telling folks about something that is a fact.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:29.460]  This is real.
[02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:41.506]  The Carrington event happened in the 1800s, the late 1800s, named after a scientist named Carrington, who registered and knew that the sun had set off a major flare.
[02:48:41.686 --> 02:48:43.066]  I mean, huge!
[02:48:43.747 --> 02:48:47.768]  And really, the only electronics of the time was the telegraph system.
[02:48:48.429 --> 02:48:50.930]  It literally fried the wires.
[02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:51.910]  It cooked it.
[02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:54.151]  You know, things burned.
[02:48:54.191 --> 02:48:55.992]  The posts started to burn.
[02:48:56.132 --> 02:48:57.152]  It was so big.
[02:48:57.773 --> 02:48:58.233]  And again,
[02:48:59.316 --> 02:49:02.377]  You know, I went into a local drugstore a couple years ago in St.
[02:49:02.417 --> 02:49:02.997]  Louis, Alex.
[02:49:03.037 --> 02:49:04.138]  They had a power outage.
[02:49:04.438 --> 02:49:07.399]  So they're trying to manually get everybody through the line, right?
[02:49:07.639 --> 02:49:08.199]  They couldn't do it.
[02:49:08.860 --> 02:49:11.200]  One, the tellers don't know how to add anymore.
[02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:17.243]  You know, without a computer saying, you know what, you gave me $15 and it was $8.15, here's your change.
[02:49:17.583 --> 02:49:18.423]  They can't do that.
[02:49:19.163 --> 02:49:20.924]  And they shut down after an hour.
[02:49:21.804 --> 02:49:26.606]  It will be the biggest catastrophe this country, this world,
[02:49:27.355 --> 02:49:27.675]  I think so.
[02:49:45.094 --> 02:49:46.796]  This is one of the best campaigns.
[02:49:46.996 --> 02:49:50.038]  Usually these campaigns, oh, find a cure to breast cancer.
[02:49:50.419 --> 02:49:51.840]  It's all just feel good, raise more money.
[02:49:51.860 --> 02:49:55.443]  I'm not against that, but why not find out why breast cancer is increasing so much?
[02:49:55.483 --> 02:49:56.504]  That's what I'd really get behind.
[02:49:56.844 --> 02:49:59.547]  What you're doing is one of the major threats to civilization.
[02:50:00.007 --> 02:50:04.551]  You are targeting something that is absolutely as big a danger as nuclear war.
[02:50:05.132 --> 02:50:06.152]  It's a reality.
[02:50:06.473 --> 02:50:08.715]  And why wouldn't our government and other governments
[02:50:09.235 --> 02:50:17.441]  Do what the engineers have said and put these hubs in, these transformer protectors in, these surge protectors in.
[02:50:17.941 --> 02:50:21.764]  That's what they are at the major power stations for one to four billion.
[02:50:21.784 --> 02:50:25.507]  I mean, this should have been done 50 years ago, George.
[02:50:25.527 --> 02:50:27.288]  It's national security.
[02:50:27.768 --> 02:50:30.550]  We've partnered with WorldNetDaily, WND.
[02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:34.213]  You can join us too, Alex, as well to get the word out.
[02:50:34.573 --> 02:50:35.374]  This is what I need.
[02:50:36.014 --> 02:50:43.878]  I need everybody who listens to you, Alex, to email their specific congressperson or senator.
[02:50:44.118 --> 02:50:48.881]  Not somebody outside their state, because they got a system now where they can not get your email.
[02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:57.647]  Email your senator or congressperson and say, you need to start thinking about legislation to insulate our power grid.
[02:50:57.707 --> 02:50:58.468]  George Norrie, stay there.
[02:50:58.488 --> 02:51:02.972]  This is exactly what a talk show host with almost 600 radio stations is supposed to do.
[02:51:03.372 --> 02:51:03.873]  George Norrie.
[02:51:04.233 --> 02:51:05.734]  I mean, nobody else does this kind of stuff.
[02:51:05.754 --> 02:51:07.115]  Good job, WorldNet Daily, as well.
[02:51:08.136 --> 02:51:08.936]  This is important.
[02:51:08.956 --> 02:51:10.677]  We're going to come back and tell you how to do it.

[02:54:07.682 --> 02:54:08.422]  Effective.
[02:54:14.454 --> 02:54:20.660]  We're going to have live coverage tonight, 7 o'clock central, InfoWars Nightly News of the crisis in Ferguson.
[02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:27.387]  It is a crisis because the government, if you wanted to cause bigger riots and then a national event, this is what you would do.
[02:54:27.907 --> 02:54:28.768]  I hope it's ignorance.
[02:54:29.009 --> 02:54:29.629]  I don't think so.
[02:54:30.190 --> 02:54:34.734]  When you've got Obama involved now in the Justice Department, you try to stir up the Trayvon Martin thing.
[02:54:35.495 --> 02:54:38.058]  Coast to coast AM, I know tonight, midnight central.
[02:54:39.271 --> 02:54:41.453]  I guess that'd be 10 o'clock Pacific.
[02:54:41.493 --> 02:54:44.255]  George Norrie will be covering it across the nation as well.
[02:54:45.136 --> 02:54:46.016]  And I was just talking to George.
[02:54:46.036 --> 02:54:48.598]  I'm going to be on his show sometime next week, so look for that as well.
[02:54:48.898 --> 02:54:49.899]  George, you've got the floor.
[02:54:49.939 --> 02:54:51.880]  I've been hogging things as usual.
[02:54:51.921 --> 02:54:53.121]  The Motormouth Bulldog.
[02:54:53.722 --> 02:54:55.183]  Tell us more about your initiative.
[02:54:55.563 --> 02:55:01.508]  World Net Daily has the headline, The End Is Near, and then breaks down your nationwide campaign.
[02:55:02.649 --> 02:55:04.993]  That got launched just in the last week or so.
[02:55:05.073 --> 02:55:06.135]  It's getting a lot of attention.
[02:55:06.776 --> 02:55:11.384]  Tell us what we do to get Congress to do the right thing.
[02:55:12.222 --> 02:55:19.105]  Alex, I've got three children, I've got six grandchildren, and I want them to have a country, a future, a life.
[02:55:19.725 --> 02:55:21.366]  That's what we're here for on this planet.
[02:55:21.426 --> 02:55:25.087]  You know, this quickness of time goes by so darn fast.
[02:55:25.147 --> 02:55:36.712]  When you look at the tragedies of Robin Williams and the other people who have just, you know, occupied a brief moment of time on this planet, I want us to enjoy it.
[02:55:36.792 --> 02:55:38.193]  That's what we're here for, to be
[02:55:39.293 --> 02:55:46.980]  Good to our fellow human beings to enjoy life at its fullest until we have to jump off and join the hereafter.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:50.402]  And this power grid is insurance.
[02:55:50.683 --> 02:55:52.684]  I don't like paying insurance on my car.
[02:55:53.025 --> 02:55:54.986]  I don't like paying insurance on my house.
[02:55:55.086 --> 02:55:55.807]  But you know what?
[02:55:56.327 --> 02:56:00.571]  If something happens, I've got the insurance and I'm happy I did it.
[02:56:01.031 --> 02:56:02.072]  That's what this is.
[02:56:02.612 --> 02:56:04.212]  We need to insulate the grid.
[02:56:04.693 --> 02:56:11.176]  It may not happen in our lifetime in terms of the X-Flare or the EMP attack, but it will happen.
[02:56:11.416 --> 02:56:13.477]  It might happen next week.
[02:56:14.417 --> 02:56:15.497]  It could happen next week.
[02:56:15.517 --> 02:56:16.338]  It could happen tonight.
[02:56:17.277 --> 02:56:19.420]  As you buy insurance, that's what it is.
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:21.322]  It is nothing in terms of money.
[02:56:21.442 --> 02:56:33.636]  If I were Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook, worth billions, I'd call up Bill Gates and say, Bill, we lose everything if the grid goes down for one to four billion dollars.
[02:56:33.996 --> 02:56:35.198]  I'm just going to write a check.
[02:56:35.959 --> 02:56:36.779]  We're going to get this on.
[02:56:36.819 --> 02:56:38.120]  They could do it privately.
[02:56:38.540 --> 02:56:43.301]  But what I need everybody to start doing is to educate their legislators.
[02:56:43.361 --> 02:56:46.923]  I've got Nick Begich through his brother Mark Begich, a senator from Alaska.
[02:56:47.403 --> 02:56:48.943]  He's looking at this now too.
[02:56:49.484 --> 02:56:53.665]  Maloof and Forshtian are working with some legislators to try to get them
[02:56:54.225 --> 02:56:58.630]  More aware of what's going on, to pass legislation, to get it done.
[02:56:58.890 --> 02:57:00.171]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:57:00.392 --> 02:57:06.017]  It actually will create some jobs in this country for a little bit, while they work on the insulating of the grid.
[02:57:06.638 --> 02:57:07.038]  It's this.
[02:57:08.109 --> 02:57:12.791]  The most important thing I think I've ever seen in my lifetime.
[02:57:13.171 --> 02:57:17.553]  Well it is, and it's something we can do something about, and all the engineers are on record.
[02:57:18.034 --> 02:57:19.194]  Congress even admits it.
[02:57:19.274 --> 02:57:21.955]  Other governments have moved somewhat in this direction.
[02:57:22.396 --> 02:57:28.378]  All the main government facilities and things, and submarines and other key weapons systems, they are insulated.
[02:57:28.819 --> 02:57:33.541]  They do have the surge protectors, basically is what they are, jumbo surge protectors.
[02:57:34.301 --> 02:57:37.222]  And you just gotta ask, why hasn't it been done with the whole grid?
[02:57:37.242 --> 02:57:45.904]  Because they started building it 120 years ago, 130 years ago, and just never really did it, so it's not something we do.
[02:57:46.825 --> 02:57:52.646]  And it's crazy that they haven't done it, because look at how solar fares blow out satellites all the time.
[02:57:53.346 --> 02:57:53.927]  Absolutely.
[02:57:54.607 --> 02:57:55.927]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:57:56.447 --> 02:58:00.789]  Let me do my quick impression of Alex Jones when an X-flare hits us.
[02:58:01.249 --> 02:58:01.849]  Here it goes.
[02:58:02.668 --> 02:58:07.596]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:09.639 --> 02:58:10.641]  That's how it'll sound.
[02:58:10.761 --> 02:58:11.602]  You'll be gone.
[02:58:12.243 --> 02:58:13.205]  It's gotta get fixed.
[02:58:13.986 --> 02:58:16.249]  Well maybe for some people they want the X-Flare to come.
[02:58:17.247 --> 02:58:18.267]  Well, some people do!
[02:58:18.327 --> 02:58:29.469]  You know, those globalists who want to control... They have estimated close to 200 million Americans will die over the course of the time that this power grid hits.
[02:58:29.509 --> 02:58:36.191]  I mean, can you imagine in winter on the East Coast, when it gets down to zero, you have no heat?
[02:58:36.491 --> 02:58:37.491]  You're gonna freeze to death!
[02:58:37.851 --> 02:58:38.431]  You're gone!
[02:58:38.471 --> 02:58:43.232]  George, promise me you'll come back to do a whole hour in the next few months just on this subject, since I... Sure.
[02:58:43.632 --> 02:58:44.734]  We'll keep pounding away at it.
[02:58:44.974 --> 02:58:45.615]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:45.876 --> 02:58:46.737]  There goes George Norrie.
[02:58:47.017 --> 02:58:47.759]  We'll be back tonight.
[02:58:47.839 --> 02:58:48.740]  Pray for our reporters.
[02:58:49.021 --> 02:58:50.723]  7 o'clock central tonight.
[02:58:51.144 --> 02:58:51.765]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:51.845 --> 02:58:53.788]  I'm going to do some overdrive.
[02:58:53.808 --> 02:58:55.791]  I'm going to think about if George will be still there.
[02:58:55.831 --> 02:58:56.753]  We're going to come back.
[02:58:56.813 --> 02:58:57.574]  InfoWars.com.
[02:59:00.544 --> 02:59:07.431]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[02:59:07.831 --> 02:59:15.159]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[02:59:29.916 --> 02:59:34.301]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[02:59:34.582 --> 02:59:39.207]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:59:39.327 --> 02:59:40.329]  Talk about the effects.
[02:59:40.649 --> 02:59:42.129]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:59:42.149 --> 02:59:43.790]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:59:44.070 --> 02:59:45.130]  I feel like I look better.
[02:59:45.190 --> 02:59:45.830]  I feel better.
[02:59:45.850 --> 02:59:46.951]  I feel sexier.
[02:59:46.971 --> 02:59:47.691]  I love it.
[02:59:47.951 --> 02:59:50.972]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[02:59:51.032 --> 02:59:53.792]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[02:59:53.972 --> 02:59:55.013]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:59:55.053 --> 02:59:56.093]  Consult your physician.
[02:59:56.233 --> 02:59:58.453]  Visit InfoWarsLive.com today.
[02:59:58.473 --> 02:59:59.434]  This is live change.
[03:00:00.914 --> 03:00:02.074]  Coast to coast.
[03:00:02.454 --> 03:00:03.855]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:04.495 --> 03:00:07.716]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.631]  Big Brother.
[03:00:17.291 --> 03:00:18.312]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:19.053 --> 03:00:20.154]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:20.815 --> 03:00:21.615]  You want answers?
[03:00:22.396 --> 03:00:23.297]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:23.958 --> 03:00:27.561]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:28.141 --> 03:00:32.245]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.709 --> 03:00:38.952]  Coast to coast, border to border, and worldwide, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:00:41.109 --> 03:00:44.031]  Tomorrow, we will try to open the phones up to take your calls.
[03:00:44.871 --> 03:00:47.793]  We got diverted off into Ferguson, but it's not just about Ferguson.
[03:00:47.813 --> 03:00:48.753]  It's about the police state.
[03:00:49.333 --> 03:00:50.754]  It's about media brainwashing.
[03:00:50.794 --> 03:00:58.238]  It's about how you're either supposed to be with the cops or with the citizens or if you're against police brutality and police attacking reporters for no reason.
[03:00:58.538 --> 03:01:00.259]  You're for thugs burning down buildings.
[03:01:01.020 --> 03:01:03.181]  No, I want the police to have great lives.
[03:01:04.275 --> 03:01:12.022]  But I don't want them driving around in armored vehicles, ready to have war, with M-16s, pointing them right at my reporters, smiling at them.
[03:01:12.463 --> 03:01:15.005]  That doesn't intimidate me or my reporters, they just want to throw up!
[03:01:16.547 --> 03:01:18.729]  I mean, this is North Korea type stuff, okay?
[03:01:19.790 --> 03:01:22.512]  I don't care, the NSA spying all of it.
[03:01:22.813 --> 03:01:26.516]  They're setting up a tyranny, they're just doing it and they don't care.
[03:01:26.536 --> 03:01:29.139]  I will be,
[03:01:31.223 --> 03:01:36.267]  Covering this tonight with YouTube videos that are uploaded to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:01:36.307 --> 03:01:43.533]  If stuff gets really bad and they shoot any more people, they already killed one other guy, I'm going to be down here live tonight on the audio and video streams right here for everybody.
[03:01:44.214 --> 03:01:46.396]  InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock tonight.
[03:01:47.096 --> 03:01:50.719]  We're going to have the prepared pre-taped news, but a live portion as well.
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:53.502]  Sometimes we're live, sometimes it's taped to air, sometimes it's a mix.
[03:01:55.268 --> 03:01:59.350]  It will be a mix because we can show more video clips and have better production when it's taped to air.
[03:01:59.370 --> 03:02:07.435]  So we'll be producing the show right up to 7 and we'll go live at first and then we will...
[03:02:08.976 --> 03:02:12.617]  Have the tape portion of the rest of the world news that I didn't even get to.
[03:02:12.738 --> 03:02:14.558]  And boy, there's a lot of news on that front.
[03:02:14.618 --> 03:02:25.423]  But Rand Paul speaking out about what's happening, a lot of people across the left, right, you name it, are worried about the military and the police being pointed at us.
[03:02:26.103 --> 03:02:29.804]  And remember, to all the good old boys out there, I know most of you aren't racist.
[03:02:30.365 --> 03:02:31.565]  You're sick of being called racist.
[03:02:31.625 --> 03:02:35.086]  You're sick of so-called minorities treating you like trash and being racist.
[03:02:35.807 --> 03:02:37.828]  And Obama has created racism on both sides.
[03:02:37.868 --> 03:02:38.568]  That was his job.
[03:02:39.588 --> 03:02:42.029]  And I know you don't like seeing a bunch of thugs running around burning stuff down.
[03:02:42.069 --> 03:02:42.949]  That's not what this is about.
[03:02:43.830 --> 03:02:57.035]  This is about after that happened, the police aiming guns at my reporters, shooting them with rubber bullets, attacking mainline reporters, arresting reporters in McDonald's, where they come over and intimidate the reporter.
[03:02:57.235 --> 03:02:58.156]  We haven't even played that yet.
[03:02:58.196 --> 03:02:59.356]  We have that Washington Post clip.
[03:02:59.936 --> 03:03:01.117]  Let's play it with the audio.
[03:03:01.677 --> 03:03:03.878]  I mean, man, I can only be pushed so far.
[03:03:05.885 --> 03:03:09.586]  And what he does to this reporter, and then takes him to jail, and they also rough him up.
[03:03:10.386 --> 03:03:11.786]  I mean, this is tyranny, folks.
[03:03:11.826 --> 03:03:12.727]  This is not freedom.
[03:03:12.907 --> 03:03:13.607]  Let's go to that clip.
[03:03:33.826 --> 03:03:37.089]  Kicking the press out of an open McDonald's so they can come in.
[03:03:37.610 --> 03:03:38.271]  Let's go!
[03:03:38.311 --> 03:03:38.551]  Let's go!
[03:03:38.711 --> 03:03:41.754]  We don't have time to ask questions.
[03:03:41.854 --> 03:03:42.275]  Let's go!
[03:03:42.295 --> 03:03:44.257]  You can move your cars out here.
[03:03:44.277 --> 03:03:44.717]  Let's go!
[03:03:44.737 --> 03:03:45.638]  This happened in 1776.
[03:03:45.818 --> 03:03:46.859]  They did the same crap.
[03:03:51.844 --> 03:03:52.704]  There's a door over here.
[03:03:53.665 --> 03:03:54.025]  Let's go.
[03:03:56.345 --> 03:03:56.746]  Let's go.
[03:03:56.906 --> 03:03:57.386]  You can move.
[03:03:57.626 --> 03:03:58.066]  Let's go.
[03:03:58.406 --> 03:03:58.706]  Move.
[03:03:59.446 --> 03:03:59.967]  Let's move.
[03:04:00.427 --> 03:04:00.987]  Let's move.
[03:04:01.527 --> 03:04:02.347]  Let's move this way.
[03:04:02.407 --> 03:04:03.408]  Here's the door.
[03:04:03.428 --> 03:04:05.388]  This way or this way?
[03:04:05.408 --> 03:04:07.569]  Stop videotaping.
[03:04:07.629 --> 03:04:10.770]  Okay, at that point, they turned his camera off and arrested him.
[03:04:10.830 --> 03:04:12.651]  So imagine, you're eating in McDonald's.
[03:04:13.011 --> 03:04:13.651]  This is what happened.
[03:04:13.671 --> 03:04:14.471]  It's all over the news.
[03:04:15.671 --> 03:04:17.052]  And guys in camo come in.
[03:04:18.584 --> 03:04:20.748]  So obviously a reporter goes, well that's a great shot.
[03:04:20.929 --> 03:04:22.091]  You know, troops in McDonald's.
[03:04:22.412 --> 03:04:23.794]  That image is archetypal.
[03:04:23.814 --> 03:04:24.997]  That's USA Today level.
[03:04:25.197 --> 03:04:26.359]  That's Washington Post.
[03:04:26.379 --> 03:04:27.482]  That's a great photo.
[03:04:30.111 --> 03:04:31.172]  What are you doing videotaping me?
[03:04:31.892 --> 03:04:39.598]  And just to show he was the big guy, hey listen, you're gonna get shown how big guy you are when you die of cancer from all the vaccines you take, dummy.
[03:04:40.058 --> 03:04:42.600]  You're gonna be shown what a big guy you are when they take your pension fund.
[03:04:43.060 --> 03:04:51.406]  You think you're being given this power to urinate on America because you're a good guy keeping us safe from Al-Qaeda that your bosses run, Jack?
[03:04:55.389 --> 03:04:56.250]  Unbelievable.
[03:04:57.153 --> 03:04:58.514]  I mean, I would start laughing at him.
[03:04:59.015 --> 03:05:01.717]  Of course I'm taking photos and videoing you.
[03:05:02.078 --> 03:05:03.579]  I'm a reporter, jackass!
[03:05:03.619 --> 03:05:04.099]  Excuse me.
[03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:06.021]  I mean, it's just unbelievable!
[03:05:06.382 --> 03:05:08.303]  Pointing guns at my reporters!
[03:05:08.503 --> 03:05:09.544]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:05:09.564 --> 03:05:09.925]  I'm doing...
[03:05:11.485 --> 03:05:12.707]  Home Security Quiz.
[03:05:13.088 --> 03:05:26.108]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[03:05:26.228 --> 03:05:27.790]  Yes, it's Facebook.
