[00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:21.352]  You're not funny, clown!
[00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:25.878]  Okay, blow that horn one more time.
[00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:27.060]  I'll have it right away.
[00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:30.425]  I'll kill you all!
[00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.479]  Ha ha!
[00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:33.679]  I'll drive you crazy!
[00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.180]  I'll kill you all!
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.521]  Armed psychopathic clowns are becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
[00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:50.444]  42 years ago, John Wayne Gacy, a former Democratic Party member and psychopathic clown known as Pogo the Clown, stalked Chicago, Illinois from 1972 until 1978, killing at least 33 young men.
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.441]  Are you going to say hello?
[00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:07.387]  The latest rash of evil clowns was first spotted in September of 2013 in Northern Ireland in the seaside town of Carrick, Fergus.
[00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:17.354]  Two mysterious characters, one known as the Carrick Killer Clown and his sidekick, caused a disturbance when they were seen acting suspiciously near a secondary school.
[00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:27.216]  That incident inspired more clown mischief in California and New York.
[00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:34.522]  An independent film company out of Staten Island, New York created what appears to be a promotional campaign that went viral.
[00:01:34.982 --> 00:01:42.608]  It began with people linked to the production company utilizing social media to create a panic that a creepy clown was stalking the community.
[00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.652]  That viral social media ploy has spawned worldwide attention.
[00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:56.367]  Due to the popularity of American Horror Story freak shows, Twisty the Clown, and the popularity of scare prank YouTube videos that have netted tens of millions of viewers,
[00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:13.194]  Teenagers in France and Spain are now copycatting the viral videos.
[00:02:13.614 --> 00:02:19.936]  More than a dozen French teenagers armed with pistols, knives and baseball bats have been arrested for attacking people.
[00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:26.237]  One pedestrian in Montpellier, France was attacked by a killer clown wielding an iron bar.
[00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:30.718]  Now Spain's Guijon clown has arrived in the wee hours of the night.
[00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:37.240]  Spain has a youth unemployment rate of 56%, while France's youth unemployment rate is 26%.
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:52.030]  As the fabric of society is torn apart by corporate piracy and inadequate leadership, I would expect we will see a rise of killer clown attacks and the like by large portions of global society with nothing to lose.
[00:02:54.192 --> 00:02:59.796]  Teenagers in France were warned by the police not to take action against the killer clowns.
[00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.406]  Guys like that, you know?
[00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:31.515]  You give clowns a bad name.
