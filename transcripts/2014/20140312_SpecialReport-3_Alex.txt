[00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:15.720]  So here at South by Southwest at the Convention Center, a lot of companies have these interactive booths set up where people can interact with their products and play these new games.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.026]  They've got a bunch of wearables with Google Glass and all sorts of virtual reality technology.
[00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:22.570]  Subway has a huge display back here.
[00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.410]  We're good to go.
[00:00:40.902 --> 00:01:01.139]  We asked if someone could just explain to us what these prototypes were for, and she went to go get her people, and they were all happy about it, but then they noticed that we were from Info Wars, and they refused to speak to the real press that's going to ask them, you know, hey, what's going on with this push for transhumanism, and is that why you're feeding us all these weird yoga foam materials?
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.022]  Because you're just preparing us for our new robo meals that we're gonna have?
[00:01:05.743 --> 00:01:16.292]  You know, they didn't want to answer those kind of questions, so they'll talk to the fake press that's gonna kiss their butt and tell them how great their product is, but she saw this and she scurried away.
[00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:24.999]  So this could be used for medicine, say, where a surgeon is working and people want to see exactly how their
[00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:26.775]  We're good to go.
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.421]  So what in the world is this?
[00:01:52.202 --> 00:01:54.883]  Yeah, so this is a remote presence device.
[00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:57.745]  It's a beam by a company called Suitable Technologies.
[00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:06.971]  And basically we created the device because we said, you know, why are people transporting their bodies places where they're not using their bodies for anything besides, you know, milling about a space?
[00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:09.692]  Wow, this is just incredible.
[00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:17.197]  So you, are you, do you feel kind of duped that you're having to sit at a desk and do South by remotely like this?
[00:02:18.434 --> 00:02:37.950]  No, so, um, we've actually got a crazy week here, so I'm grateful that I can just go to South by Southwest remotely, because I feel like if I had to deal with the flight, and then, right, you're like, oh, I have to stay out late with everybody, I just feel like I can save my energy, and then I can also, um, I'm on my computer, right, so I can be working simultaneously, sending emails, and getting work done while I'm here.
[00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:40.212]  Wow.
[00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:44.376]  Alex Jones, you need to get this technology, then you can just send yourself where you need to go.
[00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:45.497]  Why?
[00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:46.938]  Why Google Glasses?
[00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:48.320]  Why not?
[00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:53.905]  We spend so much energy trying to use these phones in every which way we can.
[00:02:54.525 --> 00:03:00.151]  You try to see with them, you try to hear things with them, you try to use them to make yourself better.
[00:03:00.811 --> 00:03:09.620]  And if you could just do it with your voice, and if the information can come straight into your eyes, I imagine that would be valuable.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.742]  Why not just implant a chip in your head next?
[00:03:12.472 --> 00:03:15.715]  Oh, because we're not at that point with Moore's Law yet.
[00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:16.976]  It's inevitable.
[00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:18.377]  It's going to happen.
[00:03:19.017 --> 00:03:19.738]  And you will.
[00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.861]  When that happens, then you can be glasses-free.
[00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:28.025]  Yeah, I imagine a lot of my friends who love the Google Glass, they love playing with the device.
[00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:30.187]  They just don't like how it looks right now.
[00:03:30.247 --> 00:03:31.548]  It's extremely intrusive.
[00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:32.829]  It's very conspicuous.
[00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.512]  And they're all waiting for Google to make contact lenses that do the same thing.
[00:03:37.212 --> 00:03:38.934]  So we all think it's inevitable.
[00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:41.316]  And all the pushback is futile.
[00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:50.283]  Has anyone yelled at you or tried to trip you or anything or something for putting their face in a facial recognition software with yours?
[00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.644]  No, Google doesn't allow that.
[00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:55.164]  It understands that this is very creepy and intrusive at the moment.
[00:03:55.204 --> 00:03:57.465]  People are really on the fence with this kind of thing.
[00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:04.566]  So you can't submit apps to the store that would do facial recognition yet.
[00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:05.406]  Right.
[00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:11.367]  And aren't you worried about someone hacking in and taking over, especially if you get that
[00:04:14.228 --> 00:04:16.929]  See, we'll cross the bridge when we get there.
[00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:22.510]  Right now, the hardest challenge is to bring hardware to that level.
[00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.352]  It's like saying that, oh, we've just discovered fire, we could maybe melt stones and make iron out of it.
[00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:32.093]  But wait, somebody could make a knife with that and kill me, so let's not
[00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:33.894]  Let's not use fire.
[00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:35.376]  That's ridiculous.
[00:04:36.017 --> 00:04:36.798]  These are just tools.
[00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.105]  You can either make the best steak in the world using the sharpest knife or you could become a homicidal maniac.
[00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:48.995]  It really depends on you and it depends on us as a society to produce people that will use this for making everything better.
