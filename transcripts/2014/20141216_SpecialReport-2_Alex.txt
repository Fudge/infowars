[00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:13.211]  Hey guys, Rob Dew and Joe Biggs here from InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News, and we're here today to give you a gear review.
[00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:21.895]  Now this is something we don't do that much on InfoWars, but we thought this piece of equipment we should definitely put a few eyeballs on, and it's the Samsung Galaxy VR.
[00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:28.958]  That's right, the new virtual reality product from Samsung, and earlier today Joe Biggs got to open up the box and take a look at it, and here's what he found.
[00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.767]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:32.107 --> 00:00:36.229]  Now today I'm going to do a product review of the new Samsung Gear VR.
[00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.451]  It's a new virtual reality headset powered by Oculus Rift.
[00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:51.815]  Now what you need to have for this is your Samsung Galaxy Note 4 telephone and what that does is that will pop into the front of the screen and be used to operate this.
[00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:54.537]  So what we're going to do now is I'm going to open this up for the first time.
[00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:55.277]  I'm pretty excited.
[00:00:55.317 --> 00:00:57.298]  We've waited a few weeks or so and I'm
[00:00:58.098 --> 00:01:00.259]  Really excited to see what's in here, so let's take a look at that.
[00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:06.082]  Alright, so as you can see, it comes in a pretty handy-dandy case.
[00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:13.845]  So as you can see, it has this front piece.
[00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:17.527]  Put your cell phone in, up here.
[00:01:17.547 --> 00:01:27.612]  Now right now I can see, whoa, there we go.
[00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:35.501]  It says, health and safety warning read and follow all warnings and instructions included with the gear VR before use.
[00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:37.762]  Gear VR should be adjusted for each user.
[00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:41.564]  Wow.
[00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:44.586]  I'm in a desert on top of a mountain.
[00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:49.709]  You can even see your shadow.
[00:01:51.872 --> 00:01:58.142]  So Joe, what were your first impressions on pulling the product out of the box, the Samsung Virtual Reality Headset, and then putting it on for the first time?
[00:01:58.162 --> 00:02:01.467]  It's like taking the world and just putting it like right there in your face.
[00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:01.728]  I mean...
[00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.460]  You submerge yourself into where you're at.
[00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:11.865]  It's like you're in an office and the next thing you know, you're standing in a field with horses running by you.
[00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.167]  It is so intense and it almost throws you off balance.
[00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:21.311]  I mean, if you even try to stand up while using this, which it says it's not recommended for, you start to lose a sense of balance.
[00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:22.772]  You definitely have to be seated wearing it.
[00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:25.773]  But, I mean, man oh man, it is intense!
[00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:26.333]  Wow.
[00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:27.874]  Well, and let's take a look at some of these.
[00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:32.075]  Ars Technica put out an article, Gear VR Product Use Warnings.
[00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:47.900]  They just basically took the page from the website or whatever they're offering, and it says, you know, consult a physician if you're pregnant, elderly, have pre-existing binocular vision abnormalities, psychiatric disorders, or suffer from a heart condition or serious medical condition.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.621]  Which you probably see that on most products.
[00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:52.963]  I mean, but I mean, you've got to understand that, like I said, it's so vivid and so there.
[00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:57.926]  I mean, you almost kind of just, if there was a fan blowing and you were staying in the desert, you would feel like you're there.
[00:02:57.946 --> 00:02:58.786]  So I can... Feel the wind.
[00:02:58.966 --> 00:02:59.206]  Yeah.
[00:02:59.587 --> 00:03:01.108]  So here, more stuff here.
[00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:04.970]  Negatively impacts hand-eye coordination, balance, and multitasking ability.
[00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.192]  So they say it should only be used on kids 13 years and older.
[00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:15.697]  Don't use it under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or if you're under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from the cold or flu.
[00:03:15.937 --> 00:03:17.358]  But we're going to get to a part about that.
[00:03:17.398 --> 00:03:18.679]  They said the emotion, the anxiety.
[00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:24.803]  Later we're going to talk about how a doctor wants to use this to treat PTSD, so that kind of conflicts with what they're saying.
[00:03:24.963 --> 00:03:27.344]  Definitely does, but they also say consult a physician.
[00:03:29.024 --> 00:03:32.586]  Immediately discontinue use if you experience any of the following symptoms.
[00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:50.032]  Seizures, loss of awareness, eye strain, eye or muscle twitching, involuntary movements, blurred, altered, or double vision, or any other visual abnormalities, dizziness, disorientation, impairment, impairment of hand-eye coordination, excessive sweating, increased salivation, nausea, lightheadedness, discomfort,
[00:03:50.572 --> 00:03:56.274]  Or pain in the head or eyes, drowsiness, fatigue, or any other symptoms similar to motion sickness.
[00:03:56.294 --> 00:04:00.035]  So they kind of akin this to being on a boat, I guess, essentially.
[00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:02.556]  And, I mean, is that what you felt putting it on for the first time?
[00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:11.559]  Yeah, I mean, one of the scenarios you can get into, you're basically hanging from the bottom of a helicopter, flying over a volcano and then to a waterfall.
[00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.700]  So it is, like I said, it's super intense.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.041]  Well, why don't you pull it over here.
[00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:17.321]  We've got it sitting right next to us.
[00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:19.822]  Show them how it works, how you put the phone in and everything.
[00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:21.929]  So you got the whole headset.
[00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:27.671]  Show them the two, it's got two, looks like lenses in the inside that you look into.
[00:04:27.711 --> 00:04:30.573]  And that's how you get the vision right there.
[00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:32.013]  That's the vision that you will see.
[00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:38.997]  And basically it projects, it just takes the image from your phone and turns it into like you're looking at it.
[00:04:40.077 --> 00:04:40.737]  Three-dimensionally?
[00:04:41.017 --> 00:04:49.520]  Yeah, so what you have is a trackpad right here where you can use it to scroll backwards and forward to pick stuff and then you select in the middle.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.541]  You can adjust your focus per person so everyone's eyes are different.
[00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:56.422]  You can adjust that here and you have a volume button as well.
[00:04:57.142 --> 00:04:58.162]  So, all right, we'll put it in.
[00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:01.503]  So you take this outside screen.
[00:05:03.362 --> 00:05:04.923]  And it gets fingerprints on it very easily.
[00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:08.584]  Now you've got to use a Samsung Galaxy 4 or Note 4 to use this.
[00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:12.546]  So the phone is specifically made for this device.
[00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:14.467]  Open it up.
[00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:15.567]  Unlock it.
[00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:19.089]  Slide it in.
[00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.410]  Easy as that.
[00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.130]  One, two, three.
[00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:24.771]  I'm going to push this back on.
[00:05:29.482 --> 00:05:30.142]  You hear that beep?
[00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:33.343]  Once you hear that beep, that says that it's connected to this.
[00:05:33.603 --> 00:05:34.243]  Thank you, R2.
[00:05:35.443 --> 00:05:39.964]  And then what you want to do, always, you know, make sure the eyepieces are nice and clean.
[00:05:41.845 --> 00:05:44.405]  Connect this up here to the top.
[00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:47.466]  And, well, there we go.
[00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:49.166]  Where are you now?
[00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:50.906]  Can you hear us?
[00:05:52.247 --> 00:05:53.067]  I'm in the Matrix.
[00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:58.328]  It says, health and safety warning, read and follow all warnings, which we just went over just now.
[00:05:59.452 --> 00:06:00.713]  And we didn't go over all the warnings.
[00:06:00.753 --> 00:06:06.577]  There's about 16 warnings listed on the Samsung.com website.
[00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:09.179]  So what you see is a crosshair directly in front of you.
[00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.621]  And what you do is you move your head to select different things that are there.
[00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:16.463]  So right now I'm going to go to the Oculus Cinema.
[00:06:16.763 --> 00:06:19.185]  I'm going to wipe the fingerprints off your face.
[00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:20.226]  There you go.
[00:06:22.898 --> 00:06:24.139]  So now you're in a movie theater?
[00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:47.732]  It's opening up, it takes a second for this one, and then it'll be, right now it looks like I'm in the entrance to a movie theater, so if you were to go like an Alamo Draft House, and then I see trailers, multi-screen, my videos, we'll say for instance... So they've got the whole video watching system set up for you to look at the different videos, and so you're basically just using an interface from the phone
[00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:51.638]  And just using the special 3D glasses.
[00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:54.520]  So now when you pick a movie, it puts you into a seat.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.921]  I'm sitting in my seat at the theater.
[00:06:56.941 --> 00:06:58.903]  There's a cup holder here, a cup holder here.
[00:07:00.043 --> 00:07:01.504]  You know, just chairs everywhere.
[00:07:01.524 --> 00:07:03.085]  I'm about 10, 15 rows up.
[00:07:03.366 --> 00:07:07.889]  You can see the exit sign of the theater over there for the door, the lights.
[00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:09.630]  I mean, it's a full interactive theater.
[00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.354]  You look straight at the screen, hit select, and then the movie begins.
[00:07:15.454 --> 00:07:17.275]  And it looks just like you would whenever you're at a theater.
[00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:19.096]  That's pretty neat.
[00:07:19.437 --> 00:07:21.678]  So here's one thing that, one question I wanted to ask.
[00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:23.660]  This is the reason we got this product to do the review.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:38.630]  Most people have seen The Matrix and they know that when they activate Neo and get him out of The Matrix, he's connected by all these different wires and gears and he's got things going into his spinal cord and basically he's inside a cocoon but he feels like he's in a real world.
[00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:45.655]  He's able to go to work, he's able to go to nightclubs, he's coding at night, doing different things and then they pop him out of The Matrix
[00:07:46.738 --> 00:07:52.943]  And they flush him down the chute into the pool of water and they pick him up and then start to rebuild his body.
[00:07:53.143 --> 00:07:54.204]  He's initially reborn.
[00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:54.805]  Right.
[00:07:54.845 --> 00:08:00.009]  So my question is, is this the first step into getting us into that cocoon eventually?
[00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:01.750]  Because that is an army plan stated.
[00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.114]  The Wachowski brothers base this off of government research about this matrix technology.
[00:08:06.174 --> 00:08:07.795]  I mean, this will turn into be a...
[00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:11.039]  Flash Gordon, quarterback, New York Jets.
[00:08:31.363 --> 00:08:32.604]  No, no, no, not that scene.
[00:08:32.784 --> 00:08:33.605]  This other scene.
[00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:36.148]  Alright, so when they remove the goggles, this is what happens.
[00:08:36.168 --> 00:08:38.570]  Grab an imager of one of those agents.
[00:08:42.093 --> 00:08:48.439]  Alright, so Joe, go ahead and remove the glasses.
[00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:49.660]  Let's see if your eyeballs pop out.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.143]  Now it looks like they're still there.
[00:08:53.632 --> 00:08:53.932]  All right.
[00:08:54.672 --> 00:09:00.454]  So, in fact, yet they have yet to dig into your mind and seep into your soul and actually steal it.
[00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:08.035]  You're still able to retain your humanity, but I think coming soon down the pipe, this is just one step in the lair of getting you into the Matrix.
[00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:10.056]  Now let's go over a couple other articles here.
[00:09:10.756 --> 00:09:13.617]  Smartphone overuse may damage eyes, say opticians.
[00:09:13.957 --> 00:09:14.957]  This is from the BBC.
[00:09:15.257 --> 00:09:16.017]  Got another article.
[00:09:16.837 --> 00:09:18.718]  Tiny screens can be a big strain on eyes.
[00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.739]  You can definitely feel that in your eye when you take it off.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.300]  Right.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.580]  Have you got screen sightness?
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.802]  Smartphones are causing sight problems to soar, warns eye surgeon.
[00:09:27.842 --> 00:09:34.505]  They're saying there's been a 35% increase with people with advanced myopia since the launch of smartphones in 1997.
[00:09:35.025 --> 00:09:36.566]  That's a pretty big increase.
[00:09:36.946 --> 00:09:41.548]  And now if you're using a virtual reality headset, it's going to make you want to use the phone even more.
[00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:49.172]  And then also something that we talked about earlier, Virtual RX, how Oculus Rift could revolutionize mental health.
[00:09:49.572 --> 00:09:54.775]  Headsets are already being called a game changer for the treatment of PTSD and other psychiatric conditions.
[00:09:54.815 --> 00:09:57.356]  Well, see, you know what I have worries about with something like that?
[00:09:57.416 --> 00:10:00.278]  You submerge yourself into a situation where you've had
[00:10:01.118 --> 00:10:05.282]  PTSD problems and they say they have a program called Virtual Iraq.
[00:10:05.922 --> 00:10:14.830]  The last thing I want to do is someone who has PTSD or another person I would think would be put back into that scenario again and it seems like that's what they're trying to do.
[00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.414]  They want to bring people back into that bad place they were in so they can learn how to cope with it.
[00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:20.575]  It just doesn't work that way.
[00:10:20.595 --> 00:10:28.242]  I think you're going to see a lot more people spaz out and freak out from something like that, but that's just my point of view as someone who's been there and done something like that.
[00:10:28.562 --> 00:10:32.326]  Or they'll want to go back into that world and keep going back into it and immersing themselves into it.
[00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:32.606]  Total recall.
[00:10:32.626 --> 00:10:33.767]  And maybe get lost into it.
[00:10:33.827 --> 00:10:34.107]  Yeah.
[00:10:34.147 --> 00:10:34.708]  Total recall.
[00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:35.168]  It could be.
[00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:39.232]  I mean, I think it's just the first step in a world that we don't want to go down.
[00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:42.275]  In addition to eye problems, there's another thing that might be occurring too.
[00:10:42.835 --> 00:10:43.636]  They've done studies.
[00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:44.877]  Here's one from Medscape.
[00:10:45.097 --> 00:10:47.840]  Long-term cell phone use linked to brain tumor risk.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.584]  Well, you know, though, a lot of the people that get tumors, they're always starting to pop up here.
[00:10:51.724 --> 00:10:56.690]  What's going to happen is when we move the phone here, are they going to start coming around up in the frontal part?
[00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.713]  Forehead tumor, or... Eyes gross in here?
[00:10:59.794 --> 00:11:01.375]  Yeah, a lot of different things.
[00:11:01.596 --> 00:11:03.097]  Here's one from New York Daily News.
[00:11:03.478 --> 00:11:06.581]  New study links wireless phone use and malignant brain cancer.
[00:11:07.122 --> 00:11:10.183]  So, are we going to see a migration of tumors?
[00:11:10.223 --> 00:11:14.084]  Tumor migration actually happened to go to the front of your face instead of the side.
[00:11:14.724 --> 00:11:17.045]  And is that, are those tumors easier to treat?
[00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:19.306]  Are they easier to take care of?
[00:11:19.686 --> 00:11:20.086]  Who knows?
[00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:22.587]  There's a lot of different things that aren't answered with this technology.
[00:11:22.727 --> 00:11:23.707]  It is new technology.
[00:11:24.207 --> 00:11:27.048]  It's listed on the website as a developer model when you buy it.
[00:11:27.388 --> 00:11:32.430]  So, you'll be able to see that there when you go to Samsung if you want to purchase these, if you own the Galaxy phone.
[00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.351]  Now, Joe, is this something that you think you're going to take home and use a lot?
[00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:36.919]  Uh, yeah.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.080]  So there we are.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.081]  We've proved that this is the first step into going into the Matrix.
[00:11:43.262 --> 00:11:44.582]  And will you be able to get out?
[00:11:44.622 --> 00:11:45.322]  Will it be easy?
[00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:55.165]  Will you be stuck in a cocoon someday, 35 years into the future, going, man, if I could just go back in time and take this headset off, maybe this wouldn't happen to me.
[00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:01.910]  You never know.
[00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.113]  That's the way these things, to me, appear.
[00:12:05.794 --> 00:12:09.598]  The way we're traveling here in this new world, this brave new world order that we're undergoing.
[00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:10.860]  Joe, do you have anything else to add?
[00:12:12.007 --> 00:12:15.691]  It's $200, you know, and like I said, it's a new technology.
[00:12:16.372 --> 00:12:19.495]  It's something very interesting to get into, to look at, to experience.
[00:12:19.555 --> 00:12:27.223]  Everyone in the studio today has had a chance to put it on for the most part, and everyone has the same reaction, like, oh my God, this is crazy.
[00:12:27.363 --> 00:12:28.504]  I have not put it on yet.
[00:12:28.544 --> 00:12:31.166]  Du hasn't, so we're going to let him do this for the first time.
[00:12:31.186 --> 00:12:32.768]  Let me get it set up really quick for you.
[00:12:32.948 --> 00:12:33.208]  Yeah.
[00:12:33.889 --> 00:12:39.335]  Not many people see me without my eyes, and without my glasses on, and this should be very interesting.
[00:12:39.515 --> 00:12:42.558]  I have yet to do it, and this will be a first.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:44.921]  All right.
[00:12:47.443 --> 00:12:48.304]  All right, here we go.
[00:12:48.364 --> 00:12:48.805]  Slide it on.
[00:12:48.825 --> 00:12:50.707]  All right.
[00:12:51.868 --> 00:12:52.288]  Oh, wow.
[00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:53.169]  Leave it on.
[00:12:53.209 --> 00:12:54.671]  This is definitely 3D.
[00:12:54.711 --> 00:12:56.393]  I gotta mess with the focus here.
[00:12:57.972 --> 00:12:58.272]  No.
[00:12:59.093 --> 00:13:01.996]  You know, it's not, it's, my focus is not working too well.
[00:13:02.036 --> 00:13:04.559]  It still looks a little, oh my god.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.261]  Now tell me what you see.
[00:13:06.301 --> 00:13:07.382]  Explain to everybody what you're seeing.
[00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:10.185]  Okay, yeah, there's a movie theater with the lights over here.
[00:13:10.205 --> 00:13:13.348]  That is truly remarkable.
[00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.291]  But there's nobody in this movie theater.
[00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:19.535]  So I guess at any point you could run a program where someone would come in
[00:13:22.017 --> 00:13:24.219]  Yeah, I mean, you see everything.
[00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:25.260]  It is so detailed.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.184]  The lights going up and down, the stairs, the lights around the wall.
[00:13:29.664 --> 00:13:32.107]  It looks like you see the curtains, everything like that.
[00:13:32.327 --> 00:13:33.988]  Wow.
[00:13:34.108 --> 00:13:34.629]  It's intense.
[00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:36.891]  Yeah.
[00:13:37.171 --> 00:13:39.874]  I guess I'm watching something Transformers.
[00:13:39.974 --> 00:13:40.855]  I'm not sure which one it is.
[00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:42.336]  Transformers Age of Extinction.
[00:13:42.636 --> 00:13:42.937]  Okay.
[00:13:43.612 --> 00:13:44.813]  Wow, very interesting.
[00:13:45.674 --> 00:13:48.937]  This is amazing technology and this is only the beginning of it.
[00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:51.400]  This is like the birth of this technology that we're seeing now.
[00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:53.422]  So, where am I looking?
[00:13:53.482 --> 00:13:53.742]  Right here?
[00:13:53.963 --> 00:13:55.164]  Is this the camera?
[00:13:55.264 --> 00:13:56.125]  Nope, look over here.
[00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:03.005]  It's freaking me out because I'm trying to look up at the screen, and I'm not even looking at the camera at this point.
[00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:12.311]  But what's interesting is that this technology is in its infancy, and as we see it progress, it's going to look more realistic.
[00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:16.074]  And I'd say we're three years away from being totally immersed in this type of technology.
[00:14:16.154 --> 00:14:18.775]  I mean, everything's going to have to do with it.
[00:14:18.815 --> 00:14:24.940]  When you put this on and you look at it, it talks how you can connect your watch so you can talk to people with it.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:35.764]  Yeah, you actually could see about 30 feet in front of me there was a movie theater screen showing the, I guess that was a trailer to Transformers.
[00:14:35.824 --> 00:14:37.625]  Yeah, Transformers Age of Extinction.
[00:14:37.785 --> 00:14:41.826]  Everything looked flawless, it's definitely a clean world just like the Matrix.
[00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:46.008]  And I guess every once in a while you'll see a glitch, you'll see the cat run back twice.
[00:14:46.508 --> 00:14:50.890]  Here you go, that is a Samsung Galaxy VR, brand new, just out about a week.
[00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.336]  For the low, low price of $200 and we've reviewed it here for you at InfoWars.com.

[00:15:55.637 --> 00:16:05.329]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:16:05.649 --> 00:16:09.412]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
