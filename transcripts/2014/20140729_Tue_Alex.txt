[00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.652]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:07.595]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.200]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:17.901]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:19.723]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:21.204]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:22.865]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:27.127]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:31.830]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:39.555]  He told the London Guardian two weeks ago that
[00:00:40.822 --> 00:00:46.124]  The NSA spy grid is about totalitarian oppression and quote total control.
[00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:55.567]  William Binney, the most high-level NSA whistleblower in history, will be joining us coming up in the second hour today.
[00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:06.170]  I want to discipline myself and give you a lot of the headlines today and go over some of the news, but open the phones up to discuss several issues.
[00:01:08.098 --> 00:01:14.102]  Obviously we'll break down the latest on the imploded border, but I really want to get into impeachment.
[00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:20.127]  The Democrats, for the last few years, have been raising money.
[00:01:21.327 --> 00:01:25.210]  My dad, for some reason, gets Democrat and White House emails.
[00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:30.274]  Even though he's not a Democrat, he's been getting them for a long time.
[00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:37.480]  I guess since my mom one time gave money to some environmental group that came to her door, so we actually know where it all came from.
[00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:43.024]  The point is, he gets these emails and forwards them to me, but you've seen them in the news.
[00:01:43.664 --> 00:01:50.428]  Just a few days ago, they're raising money on the prospect that his impeachment is imminent.
[00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:55.351]  And you've got Pat Buchanan and others a few weeks ago saying, don't impeach Obama.
[00:01:56.687 --> 00:02:06.017]  Because if you try to impeach him, it'll make him a martyr politically, and then that will actually boost his approval ratings and won't cause a Republican landslide.
[00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:06.898]  And you know what?
[00:02:06.938 --> 00:02:07.639]  That may be true.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.221]  That may be true.
[00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:17.510]  All I know is the country may not make it another two years, and you've got to prosecute crime
[00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.111]  Or it sets the precedent that the sky's the limit.
[00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:24.372]  And I've talked about this a lot.
[00:02:24.392 --> 00:02:26.633]  I mean, this is 101 in criminology and law.
[00:02:27.173 --> 00:02:28.033]  Everybody knows this.
[00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:28.974]  I'm stating the obvious.
[00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:32.835]  But they've already gotten to the point of the sky being the limit.
[00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:40.358]  They already have illegals protesting with no fear of arrest in front of the White House demanding more.
[00:02:42.038 --> 00:02:43.559]  And demanding more benefits.
[00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:55.774]  And it just shows what a joke this country is that veterans can't get health care and are put on death lists, death panel lists to be denied care, which is a death sentence for brain tumors, you name it.
[00:02:56.234 --> 00:02:58.336]  Totally operable, lung cancer, you name it.
[00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:06.782]  And the illegals can march in at any city run or county run or private charity hospital and get the health care.
[00:03:07.162 --> 00:03:09.384]  And it's not that I'm even against these individual people.
[00:03:09.664 --> 00:03:13.867]  They're all mad and angry and really feel like from the media they deserve everything.
[00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:17.605]  Got here from Guatemala a month ago, you should get everything free.
[00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:20.208]  Get here from China a month ago, you should get everything free.
[00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.572]  Get here from Romania or Turkey a month ago, you should get everything free.
[00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:28.515]  And that's just not the case, obviously.
[00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:33.340]  It's the political class creating a new form of slavery.
[00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:41.033]  Where they get 51% to vote through the governmental taxation system to rob the other 49.
[00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:57.305]  And, you know, I'm not a big fan of Mitt Romney, but when he got recorded at a fundraiser saying, look, 47.8%, or whatever the number was, I think it was 47.8%, don't care what you say or what you do, they're gonna vote Democrat.
[00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:02.189]  They're gonna vote to expand socialism because they are on the dole.
[00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:07.478]  And he got criticized for, quote, attacking the 47%.
[00:04:08.158 --> 00:04:12.682]  There are 100-plus million people, 101 million people on federal welfare.
[00:04:13.822 --> 00:04:15.724]  Every time I mention that number, people don't believe me.
[00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:17.265]  That's mainstream news.
[00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:21.948]  Just type in, over 100 million people are on federal welfare.
[00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:23.890]  That number's growing.
[00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.891]  You've got over 52% now.
[00:04:26.712 --> 00:04:27.993]  Just a few years ago, it was 47%.
[00:04:28.193 --> 00:04:33.257]  The last number I saw from the Government Accounting Office, GAO,
[00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:39.295]  Governmental Accounting Office, was it's 52% now, are government dependent.
[00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:47.321]  So that's why the system is so arrogant now, and we could use the quote from Aliens, game over man!
[00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:52.685]  Because if we don't turn it around very quickly, you can stick a fork in it, we're done.
[00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:58.170]  There'll still be some trench warfare politically, and groups trying to get together.
[00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:01.899]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.764]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[00:05:06.784 --> 00:05:10.447]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:24.861]  I think?
[00:05:44.932 --> 00:05:52.216]  Five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:56.038]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[00:05:56.378 --> 00:06:02.621]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[00:06:03.001 --> 00:06:08.084]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:15.947]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:20.370]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:06:20.731 --> 00:06:25.275]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:28.316]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:06:28.616 --> 00:06:33.798]  You now know it as Survival Shield Prunascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:06:34.058 --> 00:06:40.940]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.201]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:50.363]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:50.703 --> 00:06:51.543]  This is innovating.
[00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:59.111]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:06:59.332 --> 00:07:03.396]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:08.782]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:10.865]  I didn't, like, taste dirt in it.
[00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:12.006]  God knows what's in there.
[00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:16.371]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:22.438]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a Pro-Pure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:23.579]  That one is better.
[00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.761]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:26.302]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:26.863]  It's good water.
[00:07:26.983 --> 00:07:32.786]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:07:33.027 --> 00:07:40.151]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:07:40.351 --> 00:07:42.872]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:51.117]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:07:51.277 --> 00:07:52.558]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:53.318]  It's good water.
[00:07:53.518 --> 00:07:53.959]  Refreshing.
[00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:54.439]  It's good!
[00:07:54.739 --> 00:08:02.545]  Go to infowarsstore.com today and get your free wire stand with the purchase of a Pro-Pure Big Water Filtration System.
[00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:03.366]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:29.260]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.661]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:35.684]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.052]  So you got a nine-year-old daughter, a ten-year-old son.
[00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:52.874]  You let them play at the park across the street from your house.
[00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:55.676]  You're gonna go to jail.
[00:08:55.716 --> 00:08:57.277]  CPS is gonna take your child.
[00:08:59.088 --> 00:09:22.356]  But if you live in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Brazil, anywhere south of the border, and you want to put your children on planes or buses as young as three years of age and fly them here, or bus them here, the Border Patrol will meet the bus, won't turn it around back into Mexico, and will load them on Greyhound buses and other buses
[00:09:23.502 --> 00:09:33.537]  with CPS guardians and will ship them in to be dropped off wherever the notes in Spanish tell them to send the children.
[00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:38.083]  So if you're human smugglers you can deliver a five-year-old kidnapped kid
[00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:54.621]  With the paperwork, or you can show up with a five-year-old you've kidnapped, or an eight-year-old, or a three-year-old, with any fake ID you want, any consular matricula, that you can literally get out of Cracker Jack boxes, and you will be sent anywhere you want to go in the U.S.
[00:09:56.162 --> 00:10:04.188]  But I personally, not once, not twice, but three times, have been in Washington, D.C., making my own films,
[00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:12.475]  Being in a Discovery Channel TV show and being in a independent film channel TV show three times.
[00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:25.798]  And I have been 200 yards from the Washington Monument on the grass videotaping the monument and had security guards and police come over and say, we will arrest you if you videotape.
[00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.278]  You have to have a permit.
[00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:35.020]  And then Discovery Channel and the rest of them would say, there is no permits issued in DC for public comments.
[00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:37.560]  And they said, hey, you want to go to jail?
[00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:54.247]  If you go down to the White House within 200 yards of it, in the park across the street, and start taking photos, Secret Service on bicycles jump off, run up, bow up to you, and say, stop videotaping or taking photos or we'll arrest you.
[00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:57.688]  And the first time this happened, I thought they were messing with me.
[00:10:59.369 --> 00:11:04.371]  And I quit videotaping just to see what was happening, and they ran over to school kids
[00:11:05.194 --> 00:11:25.926]  With their Midwestern parents, right out of Lampoon's vacation, National Lampoon's, and would get in their face, and they would grovel in fear and run off, and they would just do it to family after family, because the message is, you're scum if you're an American citizen, roll over and learn to be a prisoner.
[00:11:27.027 --> 00:11:28.608]  This is total prisoner induction.
[00:11:28.968 --> 00:11:30.369]  The TSA, all of it.
[00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:51.270]  So remember with the backdrop of all this news we're going to cover today, that thousands of illegal aliens arrogantly, the videos are just so arrogant, stomping around like they've just been robbed or their children have been killed, demanding total instant legalization and more welfare.
[00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:59.294]  Just stomping around and waving all the flags of the Democratic Party and that whole agenda.
[00:12:00.407 --> 00:12:03.028]  And they are angry, and they want it all, and they want it now.
[00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:22.795]  But American citizens who try to show up and shoot video of the White House, as if you can't get it from Google Streets or anywhere else, literally have Secret Service follow them around.
[00:12:22.915 --> 00:12:24.915]  And then we were walking around D.C.
[00:12:24.935 --> 00:12:27.856]  I think we have footage of this.
[00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:28.737]  We've aired it before.
[00:12:29.568 --> 00:12:30.389]  Four or five years ago.
[00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:41.858]  And the Secret Service in plain clothes on bicycles was following us when we were 800 to 1,000 yards away, just walking down the street.
[00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:47.063]  And they would stop behind bus stops and they were chewing gum and looking at us in their dark sunglasses.
[00:12:47.603 --> 00:12:50.405]  I mean, it's all just mental illness, folks.
[00:12:51.546 --> 00:12:56.651]  It's tyranny dressed up like it's legitimate and like it's keeping somebody safe.
[00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:15.812]  That's folks protesting out front the White House, where if you don't have a permit to demonstrate, which they don't issue, and you're a Tea Party group, you get arrested.
[00:13:21.355 --> 00:13:28.799]  And again, it's the discrimination of the fact that there's no basic freedom in this country, according to the government.
[00:13:30.148 --> 00:13:31.869]  The freedom is alive in our hearts and minds.
[00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.951]  And it's alive when we exercise it.
[00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:37.813]  But they would have us believe that we have absolutely no rights.
[00:13:38.253 --> 00:13:43.677]  Last night, I watched Jack Ryan, Shadow Recruit.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:54.764]  And I like the actors that are in the film, but it was unwatchable.
[00:13:55.765 --> 00:13:56.986]  And I knew how it was going to end.
[00:13:57.967 --> 00:13:59.808]  And here's a film that came out a year ago.
[00:14:01.732 --> 00:14:02.732]  We're good to go.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.864]  You know, video game come out the year before the Georgia conflict, with the exact same conflict unfolding.
[00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:39.854]  Because it's all pre-planned, so people are then comfortable with Russia being the enemy now, because it was already pre-programmed years before that the Cold War is back on.
[00:14:40.695 --> 00:14:42.116]  It's scripted, is my point.
[00:14:43.657 --> 00:14:51.924]  And the larger issue is, the globalists are going after any stable country in the Middle East, any secular government in the Middle East,
[00:14:53.067 --> 00:15:04.297]  Any Christian supporting government in the Middle East, they're going after Russia that's trying to stabilize itself and stabilize Eastern Europe when the EU wants to suck Eastern Europe dry and exploit it.
[00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:07.600]  And they're going after us.
[00:15:08.821 --> 00:15:13.465]  The globalists are going after our infrastructure, our jobs, our families.
[00:15:15.527 --> 00:15:18.090]  The globalists are moving on every front right now.
[00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:24.122]  This is a very historical time to be alive, and everything they do is basically bad.
[00:15:24.562 --> 00:15:38.591]  You can debate within the spectrum who's right, who's wrong, and the politics of any given issue, but you have to pull back from Republican and Democratic rhetoric and actually look at who the special interests are and what they want.
[00:15:40.752 --> 00:15:45.615]  And the larger agenda is for global governance, autocratic totalitarianism,
[00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:51.570]  Attacking every institution, the family, the church, you name it.
[00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.151]  Not that the church is even good.
[00:15:53.571 --> 00:16:04.416]  It's been government run for a long time, but all institutions are to not just be overtaken, they are to be pulled down so that no competing system can exist.
[00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.077]  Monetary, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:07.177 --> 00:16:10.559]  It's the opposite of diversity, the opposite of choices.
[00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:16.990]  And through the Democratic Party right now, we see the vanguard of the movement.
[00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:29.940]  Class warfare, race warfare, social division, man against woman, old against young, death panels, veterans being kicked off health care, put on death lists to not be given care.
[00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:31.742]  On record.
[00:16:32.582 --> 00:16:33.843]  And the media calls it a screw-up.
[00:16:33.863 --> 00:16:35.645]  It's not a screw-up, it's a policy.
[00:16:37.517 --> 00:16:40.519]  It's not a screw-up on the border, like Rick Perry says about Obama.
[00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.220]  It's a deliberate policy.
[00:16:45.442 --> 00:16:47.424]  People ask why I praise Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
[00:16:48.004 --> 00:16:50.646]  They're the only ones that will say it's deliberate, because it is.
[00:16:51.606 --> 00:16:54.288]  The Border Patrol says it's deliberate and shows proof.
[00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:56.430]  We go down to the border and show proof.
[00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:57.911]  We have the facts.
[00:16:58.431 --> 00:16:59.452]  We're nothing special.
[00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.733]  Anybody can say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.015]  Anybody can try to be decent.
[00:17:05.982 --> 00:17:08.143]  There is no debating this.
[00:17:08.383 --> 00:17:09.563]  There is no choice.
[00:17:09.603 --> 00:17:22.626]  You either join with the evil and be a schmuck, be a chump, be a sucker, be a mark, be a mind-controlled cult member, or you decide that you're going to resist what's happening.
[00:17:23.807 --> 00:17:25.107]  It's in your own best interest.
[00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:31.989]  It's in all our best interest to say no to all of this.
[00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.671]  Now folks, there's a lot of news here.
[00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:43.333]  And if we do a document cam shot, I can show folks the stacks here.
[00:17:43.993 --> 00:17:49.394]  We've got the InfoWars stack of news, world news, science and tech, politics, economy, U.S.
[00:17:49.455 --> 00:17:51.655]  news, Russia, Ukraine, border crisis.
[00:17:53.056 --> 00:17:57.337]  This is all news we've been working on and researching since last night, right through to this morning.
[00:17:57.617 --> 00:18:00.178]  And I'm going to try to get into all of this important news.
[00:18:05.282 --> 00:18:12.207]  But if you pull back from all of this, what is the tie that binds it?
[00:18:12.287 --> 00:18:15.090]  What is the connecting strand?
[00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:22.696]  It is the globalists on record that are engineering and steering this whole situation and they are our enemies.
[00:18:23.885 --> 00:18:33.656]  They have made a conscious decision to wreck civilization, to consolidate power, to dumb populations down, to poison populations with propaganda and with physical toxins.
[00:18:34.477 --> 00:18:43.227]  This is a psychotronic, positronic, technotronic system of total domination.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:49.211]  And I don't tell you that to demoralize you and to make you scared.
[00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:51.032]  I believe you have courage.
[00:18:51.192 --> 00:18:56.015]  I believe that when faced with the real adversity, you will mobilize against it.
[00:18:56.876 --> 00:19:01.219]  So many cowards out there in the system misinterpret this radio broadcast.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.082]  And they wrongfully think that I'm fear-mongering up here.
[00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:08.841]  If I wake up at 2 a.m.
[00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:22.773]  because I smell smoke and the dogs are barking, and the neighbor's house across the street on the hill has fire shooting out of it, it is not fear-mongering to call the fire department, to dial 911.
[00:19:23.674 --> 00:19:27.277]  It's a course of action to ensure that I'm rendering aid.
[00:19:29.795 --> 00:19:37.201]  I'm gonna grab my binoculars next, and if I see it looks like people need help, I'm going to go climb their fence, and I'm gonna go and render aid.
[00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:44.686]  Not because I'm a hero, not because I'm a busybody, but because that's what I do.
[00:19:45.527 --> 00:19:48.829]  That's what my ancestors did, and I expect you to come to my aid.
[00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.031]  This is about mutual goodwill.
[00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:57.189]  And it's about seeing that we're in a propagandized system of fraud and rejecting it.
[00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:01.052]  Because, look, you either reject the whole thing or you can't beat it.
[00:20:01.873 --> 00:20:03.534]  You can sit there and pick it apart all day.
[00:20:03.855 --> 00:20:04.916]  We know it's a fraud.
[00:20:05.256 --> 00:20:06.197]  We need to break with it.
[00:20:06.737 --> 00:20:08.659]  The Border Crisis, in focus, straight ahead.
[00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:17.516]  Big business has discovered the preparedness market, and that makes it difficult to know where to go and who to trust.

[00:21:06.894 --> 00:21:08.756]  MyPatriotsupply.com.
[00:21:09.537 --> 00:21:12.099]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[00:21:12.299 --> 00:21:17.184]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at MadeIn1776.com.
[00:21:17.264 --> 00:21:20.347]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[00:21:24.411 --> 00:21:29.114]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[00:21:29.134 --> 00:21:30.535]  There's only 500 of each.
[00:21:30.795 --> 00:21:34.878]  We're talking about made in America belt buckles and nickel brass.
[00:21:34.978 --> 00:21:37.040]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.122]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:51.726]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[00:21:52.026 --> 00:21:55.528]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[00:21:55.868 --> 00:22:02.110]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:07.512]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[00:22:08.942 --> 00:22:09.342]  Question.
[00:22:09.703 --> 00:22:13.926]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:22:14.486 --> 00:22:15.327]  Answer, yes.
[00:22:15.747 --> 00:22:21.512]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Teriganics.
[00:22:21.992 --> 00:22:29.217]  Pro-EM-1 is a powerful liquid probiotic that uses good bacteria to suppress pathogens and gently eliminate toxins from your body.
[00:22:29.558 --> 00:22:37.604]  A healthy digestive system will cleanse and remove toxins, support weight loss, improve absorption of food nutrients, and aid in controlling yeast and other infections.

[00:22:45.849 --> 00:22:48.210]  Pro-EM-1 is the key to your digestive health.

[00:22:56.755 --> 00:22:56.995]  That's 866-369-3678.
[00:22:57.015 --> 00:22:58.316]  Also available through Amazon Prime.
[00:22:58.436 --> 00:22:59.657]  Pro-EM-1 from Terragonics.
[00:22:59.677 --> 00:23:00.557]  Life's getting better.
[00:23:08.308 --> 00:23:17.575]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:17.615 --> 00:23:18.355]  This capitalism?
[00:23:18.416 --> 00:23:24.540]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.223]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:23:28.283 --> 00:23:29.204]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:29.224 --> 00:23:30.264]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:30.545]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:30.605 --> 00:23:30.945]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.531]  Do you ever feel like you live in an alternate universe?
[00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:44.572]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying.
[00:23:45.153 --> 00:23:47.914]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[00:23:48.174 --> 00:23:49.374]  Chaos on our border.
[00:23:49.794 --> 00:23:51.855]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[00:23:52.315 --> 00:23:53.876]  Life is getting ready to change.
[00:23:54.256 --> 00:23:56.877]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.
[00:23:57.297 --> 00:24:00.458]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[00:24:00.498 --> 00:24:00.698]  That's 888-507-8789.
[00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:20.308]  Top story on DrugsReport.com.
[00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:23.750]  Boner rules out impeachment.
[00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:24.351]  John Boehner.
[00:24:24.371 --> 00:24:31.456]  And again, I want to open the phones up in the next segment to ask you the question.
[00:24:32.256 --> 00:24:34.038]  I understand what Pat Buchanan is saying.
[00:24:34.078 --> 00:24:38.201]  I know Pat Buchanan personally worked on his campaign three different times.
[00:24:40.276 --> 00:24:41.517]  I respect Pat Buchanan.
[00:24:41.557 --> 00:24:45.798]  He's a good, paleo-conservative, libertarian, constitutionalist.
[00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:48.779]  He says, don't impeach Obama.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:55.662]  Let libertarian Republicans take over the Republican primaries, which they're doing.
[00:24:56.142 --> 00:24:59.663]  Let them get into the state and congressional federal level.
[00:25:02.384 --> 00:25:08.687]  But the problem is, Obama could start new wars during the next two years.
[00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:23.547]  He could stage a false flag and basically stay in office indefinitely or put a permanent bureaucracy in place via Homeland Security that transcends his administration and is a bureaucratic dictatorship.
[00:25:24.488 --> 00:25:32.154]  The economy could completely implode under Obama and he could set the course for socialism and expand to taxation and government control.
[00:25:33.034 --> 00:25:38.439]  You see how he's already imploded the border extrajudicially?
[00:25:39.514 --> 00:25:52.237]  Extra legislatively, and is saying he's set to sign executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment and to legalize illegals outside of his congressional requests.
[00:25:53.137 --> 00:25:57.358]  He's not going to Congress to get a law passed, or even an authorization.
[00:25:58.418 --> 00:26:01.959]  He's just doing it as a fiat dictator.
[00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:11.701]  Not as a dictator who will be permanent and stay in office, but as a operating dictator for all intents and purposes.
[00:26:11.761 --> 00:26:20.023]  And more and more congressmen and senators are now saying that because that's what's happening.
[00:26:20.743 --> 00:26:22.744]  If we got a dictator, would we notice?
[00:26:23.644 --> 00:26:30.206]  Not since Lincoln have we seen a president operate like this outside of Congress.
[00:26:31.192 --> 00:26:33.073]  And that was the Civil War last time.
[00:26:33.433 --> 00:26:41.397]  And notice he's been billed by the Democrats when he first ran back in 2007-2008 as the second coming of Lincoln.
[00:26:41.977 --> 00:26:46.340]  He would crush the bitter clingers that clung to their Bibles and their guns.
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.461]  And so Boehner has come out.
[00:26:50.982 --> 00:26:56.885]  The Washington Times is reporting, as he did a month ago, and he has ruled out impeachment.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.362]  He says it's a scam started by Democrats.
[00:27:01.002 --> 00:27:07.508]  And I agree that it is a scam going on for several years by the Democrats to say impeachment is imminent.
[00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:08.729]  We need to
[00:27:11.505 --> 00:27:13.206]  Raise money for him right now.
[00:27:14.567 --> 00:27:20.190]  Or he will reverse the Republicans and impeachment will reverse the wonders of Obamacare.
[00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.972]  And they will reverse the wonders of everything else that's been done.
[00:27:25.373 --> 00:27:27.434]  The wondrous death panels, the wondrous
[00:27:28.234 --> 00:27:39.784]  Losing your doctor and having your health plan go up in price, and the wondrous payroll tax on poor people, and the wondrous open borders, and the wondrous putting our military under U.N.
[00:27:39.844 --> 00:27:57.138]  control, and the wondrous Common Core teaching 2 plus 2 equals 5, and the wondrous black plague, and tuberculosis, and flesh-eating bacteria, and mites, and pinworms, and just everything spreading across the country right now as we collapse into a third world nation.
[00:27:58.988 --> 00:28:05.431]  The wondrous liver flukes showing up in Californian water supplies that were formerly not even in Central America.
[00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:07.152]  They were in South America.
[00:28:10.734 --> 00:28:26.301]  And so you can look at that and say, do you play politics and hope a bunch of libertarians get elected, which is starting to happen, and then reverse everything that the Democrats with their Republican blue blood, neocon cohorts have engaged in?
[00:28:27.714 --> 00:28:34.640]  Do you let Obama keep operating for another two years when every week he tops his last outrage?
[00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:36.842]  My gut tells me absolutely not.
[00:28:37.603 --> 00:28:38.884]  You don't play politics with this.
[00:28:38.904 --> 00:28:39.745]  We've done this too long.
[00:28:40.045 --> 00:28:41.326]  He will pardon himself.
[00:28:41.767 --> 00:28:43.708]  He will pardon everybody else around him.
[00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:49.073]  Impeachment, removing him from office, is the only thing that stops him from being able to do that.
[00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:52.797]  And you send a message to the political criminal class
[00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:55.460]  That the games are over.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:09.347]  And then you use that impeachment process to empower the states to create a new coalition of states to organize and to elect pro-Constitution, pro-Liberty, American Restoration, emergency party people.
[00:29:10.067 --> 00:29:11.628]  I mean, you call it the emergency party.
[00:29:12.428 --> 00:29:14.029]  And if Democrats want to join it, that's fine.
[00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:15.570]  We've got to right the country.
[00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:21.233]  We don't want to wreck it and scuttle it under Cloward and Piven and Agenda 21 so they can take over.
[00:29:22.113 --> 00:29:30.161]  We don't want to go to a conquest government, a total collapse government, people standing in line for their welfare like the old Soviet Union.
[00:29:30.521 --> 00:29:33.925]  That's the model of state control they admit they're going for.
[00:29:34.726 --> 00:29:36.267]  And if the political class
[00:29:37.295 --> 00:29:41.836]  If he isn't scared into submission, they're going to go ahead with it, which you see them doing now.
[00:29:42.416 --> 00:29:43.757]  I want to get your take on this.
[00:29:43.837 --> 00:29:44.617]  Do we impeach?
[00:29:45.137 --> 00:29:46.437]  Or do we not impeach?
[00:29:46.457 --> 00:29:47.318]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:47.338 --> 00:29:47.898]  First-time callers.
[00:29:47.918 --> 00:29:48.018]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:48.038 --> 00:29:49.078]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.098 --> 00:29:49.578]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.598 --> 00:29:50.718]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:50.858 --> 00:29:52.639]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.054 --> 00:30:12.956]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:13.096 --> 00:30:15.038]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:30:15.258 --> 00:30:21.243]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:30:21.443 --> 00:30:26.447]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:30:26.527 --> 00:30:31.231]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:30:31.391 --> 00:30:35.933]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.

[00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:08.653]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:12.626]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:32:13.147 --> 00:32:20.111]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:30.978]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:32:31.399 --> 00:32:40.645]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:32:41.365 --> 00:32:44.787]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:32:45.427 --> 00:32:48.888]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:32:49.188 --> 00:32:50.789]  Experience the new formula.
[00:32:51.249 --> 00:32:53.250]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:54.831]  Shield your family.
[00:32:55.171 --> 00:32:56.551]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:32:56.972 --> 00:32:59.593]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:00.133 --> 00:33:04.095]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:33:24.927 --> 00:33:28.830]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:29.911 --> 00:33:34.615]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:42.227 --> 00:33:51.313]  There is a globalist revolution taking place, not just against the United States, but against every other sovereign nation on this planet.
[00:33:52.334 --> 00:33:53.855]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:53.915 --> 00:33:55.676]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:55.716 --> 00:33:57.698]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[00:34:00.419 --> 00:34:11.307]  But finishing up the point I was getting to in the last segment, this country is literally marinated in propaganda and disinformation.
[00:34:12.609 --> 00:34:21.194]  Any major sitcom or drama or movie I watch is just full of anti-male, anti-gun, anti-family garbage.
[00:34:22.195 --> 00:34:32.101]  Or when there is a good male role model, like in Jack Ryan's Shadow Recruit that I watched on DVD last night that came out about a year ago,
[00:34:36.434 --> 00:34:49.747]  If there is a positive male role model, he works for the CIA, and it's so sexy, and it's so cool, and his wife, his girlfriend, just has no idea, you know, how awesome he is.
[00:34:51.486 --> 00:34:59.989]  And he's implanted inside the financial sector, and there's a secret war going on with Russia, they're the new enemy.
[00:35:00.469 --> 00:35:04.071]  Again, all of this being pre-prepared, all of this being rolled out.
[00:35:04.471 --> 00:35:15.175]  And then at the end, he's done a good job, and he's a good Boy Scout, they say, so he gets to go in and he gets to meet with the President.
[00:35:16.198 --> 00:35:21.260]  And he walks into the room and meets the President, and it's like he's died and gone to heaven.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.521]  He's gone across the pearly gates.
[00:35:25.682 --> 00:35:41.728]  And the average person watching this literally thinks that the only thing better than winning an Oscar, the only thing better than winning a gold medal at the Olympics, the only thing better than inventing the cure to cancer, is to meet with the President.
[00:35:42.554 --> 00:35:51.981]  And that's what the big airplanes are about, and the red carpets, and the shutting down the highways, is this big illusion that the President runs something.
[00:35:53.622 --> 00:35:59.967]  Sure, there have been a few Presidents, like Nixon or Kennedy, that tried to run things, and you saw what happened to them.
[00:36:00.387 --> 00:36:04.110]  Whether they were good or bad, they were removed by the special interest.
[00:36:05.811 --> 00:36:07.192]  Presidents are puppets.
[00:36:09.437 --> 00:36:17.122]  And the CIA is a giant, sprawling bureaucracy involved in every evil under the sun.
[00:36:18.303 --> 00:36:18.723]  On record.
[00:36:20.885 --> 00:36:22.305]  It's declassified on record.
[00:36:22.325 --> 00:36:30.551]  1997 CIA Inspector General hearings in Congress that they ship in the majority of the narcotics and launder the money.
[00:36:32.517 --> 00:36:36.399]  When a cop wants to search your car randomly, you say, well, the big banks want the drug money.
[00:36:36.659 --> 00:36:38.660]  Yeah, I know, but I'm asking what's in your car.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.420]  See, it's all a fraud.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:45.042]  The illegals can protest in front of the White House, but veterans get arrested if they do.
[00:36:47.563 --> 00:36:51.125]  Rolling Thunder Motorcycle Group tries to go up there, they get arrested.
[00:36:51.525 --> 00:36:52.305]  The illegals do.
[00:36:53.086 --> 00:36:54.987]  The illegals get to walk through TSA.
[00:36:55.427 --> 00:36:55.847]  You don't.
[00:36:59.155 --> 00:37:06.259]  The big banks get to launder the money, and get to be tax-exempt, and Google gets to be tax-exempt, and General Electric gets to be tax-exempt.
[00:37:06.699 --> 00:37:07.139]  You don't.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.521]  You're making $10 an hour?
[00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:12.982]  You're not exempt from Obamacare and the payroll tax.
[00:37:15.644 --> 00:37:27.710]  And the establishment would say, well, they're poor and they're dumb, because they were meant to be poor and dumb, and the world needs ditch diggers too, to quote Judge Schmales from Caddyshack.
[00:37:31.516 --> 00:37:34.818]  Well, I don't think that you deserve to be lied to and be run over.
[00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:56.013]  And there's nothing sadder than a brainwashed minion of this system, who has created this weird little sick relationship with the president, like he's their imaginary friend, and he's there guarding them, when all he is, is a corporate, governance, franchise, pitchman, president,
[00:37:56.966 --> 00:37:57.827]  of Coca-Cola.
[00:37:58.448 --> 00:37:59.509]  What do presidents do?
[00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:11.564]  Presidents of companies go and play golf, and go cut red ribbons, and they go hang out with the mayor of cities when they come visit, and do public relations.
[00:38:13.246 --> 00:38:14.888]  What does the CEO do?
[00:38:15.409 --> 00:38:16.410]  They run the company.
[00:38:17.608 --> 00:38:23.010]  And the CEO of this country is a roundtable of the big six banks.
[00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:27.231]  And under them, Big Pharma and the Military Industrial Complex.
[00:38:27.892 --> 00:38:37.895]  And they are 30 to 40 years advanced of us in technology and have now created technological breakaway civilization.
[00:38:39.856 --> 00:38:43.437]  And what we know about it is that it's 30 to 40 years advanced.
[00:38:43.877 --> 00:38:45.298]  They can already predict the future.
[00:38:46.246 --> 00:38:57.332]  And they've decided that we are to be eliminated and have already set up the plan to carry out the incremental phased-in actuary to end humanity as we know it.
[00:38:57.673 --> 00:38:58.673]  Game over, man!
[00:38:58.913 --> 00:38:59.634]  Game over!
[00:39:01.995 --> 00:39:05.037]  And so I'm just here saying, hey, do you want to be wiped out?
[00:39:05.377 --> 00:39:07.598]  You like your kids going into puberty at 7 instead of 14?
[00:39:07.638 --> 00:39:09.359]  Something's wrong.
[00:39:09.699 --> 00:39:10.180]  Game over.
[00:39:11.052 --> 00:39:15.094]  You like cancer rates being 3-4 thousand percent what they were just 30 years ago?
[00:39:15.594 --> 00:39:16.734]  Diabetes, same thing?
[00:39:18.715 --> 00:39:19.375]  Deformities?
[00:39:20.716 --> 00:39:22.296]  Brain disorders off the charts?
[00:39:22.957 --> 00:39:24.657]  Game over, man!
[00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:25.398]  Game over!
[00:39:25.798 --> 00:39:26.318]  Game over!
[00:39:26.758 --> 00:39:31.620]  I can sit here and cover all these stacks of news, folks, and make it real interesting for you!
[00:39:33.376 --> 00:39:42.619]  But the reason this is all happening is because the establishment has decided that you aren't going to be existing and your children aren't going to be existing down the road.
[00:39:44.419 --> 00:39:51.321]  But first they've got to implode society so we come to them with hat in hand and we'll do anything they say to get food and water.
[00:39:55.282 --> 00:39:57.343]  And that's why I can drive down I-35 and mainly see
[00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:11.448]  Good-looking, clean-cut families pulled over with cops searching their cars because that's who the cops have been ordered to search.
[00:40:12.569 --> 00:40:20.813]  They're ordered to search each day a different profile while the border is wide open.
[00:40:21.274 --> 00:40:29.598]  And I literally, every time I see it, want to pull over and go get in the cop's face who's in a military stance, walking around in their uniform with a scared family.
[00:40:29.798 --> 00:40:30.539]  It's a joke!
[00:40:32.648 --> 00:40:33.369]  It's a joke.
[00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:35.850]  That cop is eating GMO.
[00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.631]  That cop is full of poison.
[00:40:37.872 --> 00:40:41.354]  His kids probably can't even talk a large percentage of the time.
[00:40:47.838 --> 00:40:50.380]  When I was over in England a year and a half ago at Bilderberg,
[00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:00.231]  There were just, at one point, like 50 British police there.
[00:41:00.812 --> 00:41:03.713]  And a lot of them, it turned out, were listeners and knew what was going on.
[00:41:04.253 --> 00:41:06.454]  They were some of the most awake police I've ever run into.
[00:41:06.474 --> 00:41:11.616]  They had them from a whole bunch of different cities and from London up there for the event, hundreds of them.
[00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:17.519]  But a few of them would try to act imperious and bug their eyes out at me.
[00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:23.341]  And I'd walk right over to them and I'd say, I bet you got family members that aren't even that old dying of cancer right now.
[00:41:24.342 --> 00:41:24.902]  And they'd go, what?
[00:41:24.922 --> 00:41:25.683]  Why are you saying that?
[00:41:25.703 --> 00:41:26.363]  How do you know that?
[00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:35.762]  And I literally would go, give me that bag, and I would pull out the London Independent that had a cover story about half of Britons will have cancer by 2025.
[00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.131]  And I said, you're being murdered.
[00:41:40.032 --> 00:41:42.533]  You work for a system murdering you and your family.
[00:41:42.934 --> 00:41:45.916]  And I go, and if you laugh now, you won't be laughing later.
[00:41:46.216 --> 00:41:49.218]  And those cops would look completely freaked out and would just start freaking.
[00:41:49.238 --> 00:41:49.718]  You know why?
[00:41:49.758 --> 00:41:52.720]  Because they knew, folks, they knew it was all a big joke.
[00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:58.384]  They were right there until the robots roll out to control the population, and then they're done.
[00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:04.688]  You've already been given time-released chemicals and biologicals to kill you and your family.
[00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:06.850]  All of us are walking dead already.
[00:42:09.637 --> 00:42:12.780]  I don't know how else I'm supposed to explain this to you.
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:22.789]  Remember Dr. Eric Pionka at the University of Texas, who cryptically, on his own website, talks about Lucifer and dresses up in druidic robes?
[00:42:23.029 --> 00:42:23.630]  I'm not kidding.
[00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.912]  Last time I checked, it was still up on his site.
[00:42:25.952 --> 00:42:26.833]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[00:42:29.235 --> 00:42:33.579]  And Dr. Eric Pionka said, it's very sad that my family's ready.
[00:42:35.202 --> 00:42:37.003]  It will come soon, the airborne Ebola.
[00:42:37.503 --> 00:42:40.085]  It will kill 90% of us, and it will be good.
[00:42:40.105 --> 00:42:41.726]  I'm ready to die.
[00:42:41.746 --> 00:43:03.480]  And when he gave a speech at the Texas Academy of Sciences, it was in the news that there was a standing three-minute ovation with tears rolling down their faces as the professors cried as he projected on a giant screen behind him, skulls with a red filter.
[00:43:05.296 --> 00:43:08.938]  It was a rapture of evil, devil-worshipping death.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.682]  And of course, even if you don't believe in the devil, it's the Carl Jung archetype.
[00:43:17.163 --> 00:43:24.427]  The people there don't know why they get so excited celebrating the death of humanity, but it's the power trip.
[00:43:25.458 --> 00:43:43.031]  And they've already given up everything that they were and they've sold out to evil and to the globalist plan and to the power trip that they're the elite and they get a thrill like a moth flying into a bug zapper that they are part of this operation.
[00:43:48.235 --> 00:43:53.579]  William Benny, the big NSA whistleblower, bigger than Snowden, is scheduled to be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:43:57.438 --> 00:44:00.721]  He said the ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control.
[00:44:02.984 --> 00:44:11.352]  He said it is a move towards totalitarianism by a totalitarian mentality.
[00:44:12.693 --> 00:44:14.876]  You see, the reason they've got the jump on us
[00:44:16.368 --> 00:44:40.273]  Is that even though we know about all the secret medical experiments killing little kids and the rest of it, shooting people up with syphilis and the list goes on and on, the atomic soldiers, nerve gassing our own troops, forced abortions, major hospitals killing people with their organs coast to coast, still people have compartmentalized it and they feel so powerless hearing all of this, they don't want to believe it's actually happening.
[00:44:42.874 --> 00:44:43.694]  But it is happening.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.661]  The numbers don't lie.
[00:44:50.383 --> 00:45:13.835]  And so, if you want to be inducted into being a prisoner, if you want to be inducted into a total tyranny, if you want to lie to yourself about this going on, or you feel so powerless you don't think you can do anything to stop it, at least get out of our way, those of us that want to survive, and those of us that don't want to sign on to this nightmare.
[00:45:15.731 --> 00:45:17.913]  The enemy will fall on their strength.
[00:45:18.854 --> 00:45:28.182]  They will fall on the fact that it is so over-the-top and they think people coming face-to-face with this will rationalize it or deny it and won't deal with it.
[00:45:29.303 --> 00:45:41.453]  But the truth is, historically, no matter how high-tech their mind control is, people will finally wake up in the final equation and we will turn the tables on these people.
[00:45:43.188 --> 00:45:46.789]  Because they're going to do everything we've talked about here today.
[00:45:47.749 --> 00:45:50.389]  And if we're able to back them off and slow them down, that's good.
[00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.870]  But they have every intention of trying to carry this out.
[00:45:55.170 --> 00:46:02.891]  And hasn't enough of their plan come to fruition for all of you out there now to know it's really as bad as I say it is?
[00:46:08.472 --> 00:46:10.013]  How much worse does it have to get?
[00:46:10.913 --> 00:46:11.773]  Look at these headlines.
[00:46:13.194 --> 00:46:14.955]  Illegals protest outside White House.
[00:46:15.015 --> 00:46:15.816]  No fear of arrest.
[00:46:16.336 --> 00:46:20.238]  Senator Sessions, Americans will not accept nullification of their laws.
[00:46:20.358 --> 00:46:24.040]  Perry, what we're doing is a crime.
[00:46:28.783 --> 00:46:31.725]  I like the fact that that's being said.
[00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:35.207]  How many more kids are going to be put on the top of trains?
[00:46:35.267 --> 00:46:35.867]  Half a million?
[00:46:35.987 --> 00:46:36.407]  A million?
[00:46:36.807 --> 00:46:37.368]  Five million?
[00:46:40.194 --> 00:46:43.315]  So, I've got to say this, Rick Perry is now doing what I said he should do.
[00:46:43.775 --> 00:46:47.196]  He's saying it is a premeditated crime, and so we salute Rick Perry.
[00:46:48.736 --> 00:46:50.897]  I don't just want to attack Rick Perry for no reason.
[00:46:52.337 --> 00:46:55.998]  I want him to say what's happening, like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
[00:46:56.418 --> 00:46:58.358]  I want us to face what's happened.
[00:46:58.619 --> 00:46:59.939]  That's the only way to stop this.
[00:47:00.819 --> 00:47:06.420]  And again, just the issue of the collapsing border is only part of a larger program.
[00:47:07.201 --> 00:47:08.281]  Let's go back to the headlines.
[00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.732]  Democrats, legalization will help reduce the deficit.
[00:47:16.773 --> 00:47:18.074]  That's a quote from C-SPAN.
[00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:19.755]  We're going to play that later.
[00:47:22.717 --> 00:47:25.840]  I've been reporting on this for months, but now it's hitting the news.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:33.185]  Make $7,000 per month, it's between $6,000 and $8,000 in the ads we've seen, fostering adult illegals.
[00:47:33.485 --> 00:47:34.566]  See, there's the new scam.
[00:47:34.826 --> 00:47:37.408]  The feds are using the federal CPS money.
[00:47:38.544 --> 00:47:48.886]  The social worker money to let Democrats warehouse at their homes illegals and make money off of it.
[00:47:48.906 --> 00:47:51.287]  $7,000 a month to keep three people at your house.
[00:47:51.847 --> 00:47:55.948]  You stick them in one room with some mattresses and feed them.
[00:47:57.228 --> 00:47:57.909]  What's that cost?
[00:47:57.929 --> 00:47:57.909]  $1,000?
[00:47:57.949 --> 00:47:58.409]  $2,000?
[00:47:57.989 --> 00:47:58.409]  And you make $5,000.
[00:48:04.926 --> 00:48:08.091]  You see how they're taking the economy and paying their people.
[00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:09.293]  That's how they're taking over.
[00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:10.755]  This is organized crime.
[00:48:11.035 --> 00:48:12.818]  This is racketeering, by the definition.
[00:48:14.901 --> 00:48:15.943]  Residents revolt.
[00:48:16.744 --> 00:48:19.268]  What we see is an invasion, deliberate invasion.
[00:48:20.489 --> 00:48:30.634]  DFW Dallas, CBS, Jerry Brown makes religious appeal to open borders, manipulating Christians, working with the 501c3 state-run churches.
[00:48:31.034 --> 00:48:35.856]  Right-wing Baptist churches, left-wing Catholic churches, they're all state-run, folks.
[00:48:39.738 --> 00:48:42.059]  And the Republican leadership is doing nothing.
[00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:47.862]  We're going to come back in this segment the next and talk to Mike, Shelby, Andrew, John, and Mike and others.
[00:48:49.133 --> 00:48:52.234]  Mick and others to get your take on impeachment.
[00:48:53.615 --> 00:48:57.096]  Look, I get the fact that Obama is totally unpopular.
[00:48:57.136 --> 00:49:01.778]  Hillary went on CNN and badmouthed him and said she likes George W. Bush yesterday.
[00:49:02.158 --> 00:49:03.959]  That's her positioning to run for president.
[00:49:05.619 --> 00:49:07.400]  And CNN didn't even call her on it.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.961]  The media's like, well, she's pretty conservative.
[00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:13.102]  I heard her saying the open borders is wrong yesterday.
[00:49:14.082 --> 00:49:15.303]  She runs Obama.
[00:49:17.662 --> 00:49:19.263]  Are you going to fall for that trick, folks?
[00:49:20.623 --> 00:49:28.967]  And again, Rick Perry, I don't trust Rick Perry, but I said I would endorse what he's saying and doing if he started calling it criminal and deliberate.
[00:49:30.388 --> 00:49:32.649]  That's an important thing to do, because it is deliberate.
[00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:33.349]  It's premeditated.
[00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:34.170]  Big difference.
[00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.871]  We can't just let him play dumb anymore.
[00:49:37.571 --> 00:49:38.972]  You can't let Rick Perry play dumb.
[00:49:39.252 --> 00:49:41.133]  And I know our listeners are contacting Rick Perry.
[00:49:41.393 --> 00:49:41.893]  Good job.
[00:49:42.294 --> 00:49:42.734]  Now, Rick,
[00:49:43.953 --> 00:49:50.639]  You need to load these people up on buses and start driving them to the Mexican border and demanding they take them, because they're the ones that gave them passage.
[00:49:50.899 --> 00:50:01.808]  You've got to stop them at the border, legally, to prove they came out of Mexico, because under international law, Mexico's got to take them back if they are the last country that they traveled through.
[00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.392]  Again, folks, they know all this.
[00:50:06.692 --> 00:50:08.313]  The Border Patrol knows how to stop this.
[00:50:08.573 --> 00:50:10.215]  They've been telling Rick Perry how to do it.
[00:50:12.685 --> 00:50:25.414]  Briefly, please remember this transmission is listener-supported, and so we bring you the very best products at the lowest prices, whether it be super high-quality stainless steel gravity-fed filters of ProPure, discounted with a free stainless steel stand right now.
[00:50:25.695 --> 00:50:29.437]  Promo code WATER gets you 10% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:50:30.818 --> 00:50:37.823]  We have up on the InfoWarsTore.com in the ProPure area the on-the-ground taste test report, which was
[00:50:38.886 --> 00:50:45.226]  Absolutely, you know, pillar to post, people voted for the water that had been through ProPure rather than Austin Water.
[00:50:46.635 --> 00:50:48.816]  10% off promo code water and get the wire stand.
[00:50:49.137 --> 00:50:50.878]  The wire stand special is about to end.
[00:50:51.598 --> 00:50:58.922]  You can also get a 25% off on the fluoride shield with nascent iodine survival shield bottle together.
[00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:00.563]  25% off both.
[00:51:00.943 --> 00:51:03.565]  That special will end on Friday.
[00:51:03.905 --> 00:51:07.207]  That's available at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:51:09.628 --> 00:51:10.669]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:10.749 --> 00:51:15.072]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:51:15.253 --> 00:51:20.857]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:51:20.957 --> 00:51:24.300]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.102]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:51:27.202 --> 00:51:32.026]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:51:32.166 --> 00:51:32.386]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:51:32.406 --> 00:51:33.787]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:42.031]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird.
[00:51:42.631 --> 00:51:46.532]  Because they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases.
[00:51:46.992 --> 00:51:48.993]  Then my folks both got a Blocket Pocket.
[00:51:49.313 --> 00:51:51.733]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation.
[00:51:52.093 --> 00:51:54.394]  Dad knows it keeps his information private.
[00:51:54.754 --> 00:51:57.315]  I like my Blocket Pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking.
[00:51:57.335 --> 00:51:58.255]  Awesome!
[00:51:58.695 --> 00:52:01.056]  BlocketPocket.com has other cool stuff too.
[00:52:01.456 --> 00:52:03.356]  Huh, guess my parents aren't so weird.

[00:53:38.016 --> 00:53:40.597]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[00:53:49.121 --> 00:53:51.922]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.

[00:54:12.952 --> 00:54:14.193]  Alex Jones here back live.
[00:54:15.153 --> 00:54:19.776]  Representative Van Hollen says legalizing illegals will reduce the deficit.
[00:54:20.816 --> 00:54:24.218]  He was asked about what all the illegals will do to wages and workers.
[00:54:25.099 --> 00:54:28.141]  Well, Ross Perot told us what it would do and he told us what Naphthen Gat would do.
[00:54:28.601 --> 00:54:29.581]  He said it would hurt the U.S.
[00:54:29.661 --> 00:54:31.763]  and Mexico and it did.
[00:54:32.648 --> 00:54:32.968]  It did.
[00:54:33.208 --> 00:54:35.169]  It de-industrialized both countries.
[00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:37.051]  A long race to the bottom.
[00:54:37.091 --> 00:54:42.073]  Let's go to Van Hollen telling us that the sky is not blue.
[00:54:42.093 --> 00:54:57.582]  I just came from a hearing with the non-partisan director of the Congressional Budget Office who testified that if you passed the Senate bipartisan bill, you will reduce the deficit and increase long-term economic growth in the United States.
[00:54:57.622 --> 00:54:58.723]  I'm afraid I'm going to have to...
[00:54:59.943 --> 00:55:06.627]  And of course that was a larger bill with a bunch of other issues in it, but he just says that means legalizing everyone will do this.
[00:55:07.147 --> 00:55:15.112]  Some of the headlines up on InfoWars.com, Australian government pushing internet tax to quote pay for NSA style spying.
[00:55:16.172 --> 00:55:18.614]  They say the tax will be used to spy on you.
[00:55:19.274 --> 00:55:21.896]  Global elite are agitating for open war with Russia.
[00:55:22.516 --> 00:55:28.740]  Homeland Security agents raid home to seize Land Rover for violation of EPA regulations.
[00:55:29.481 --> 00:55:31.602]  They also raid Amish people that sell milk.
[00:55:31.982 --> 00:55:33.083]  But the border is wide open.
[00:55:34.184 --> 00:55:39.267]  New York police harvest innocent cell users' data to track flag vandals.
[00:55:40.834 --> 00:55:43.818]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:44.138 --> 00:55:48.023]  Photos emerge of ten active militia teams securing the U.S.
[00:55:48.163 --> 00:55:53.009]  border, but they can't really secure it because if you give them to the feds, they just release them.
[00:55:53.589 --> 00:56:00.778]  I want to keep pointing that out, not putting the militia groups down, but it's like the National Guard's just delivery boys for the illegals.
[00:56:04.633 --> 00:56:14.783]  There's another report by Washington's blog, all the countries which the US, or the globalists, have had regime change in, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, have descended into brutal chaos.
[00:56:15.383 --> 00:56:20.729]  Now I ask the question in this segment and the next, ahead of the top NSA whistleblower, William Binney, joining us.
[00:56:21.761 --> 00:56:24.743]  I ask the question, to impeach or not to impeach?
[00:56:25.124 --> 00:56:26.104]  That is the question.
[00:56:26.384 --> 00:56:45.519]  Whether it is nobler to sit here and let Obama butcher the country from pillar to post and set the precedent to commit arbitrary, racketeering crimes against the Republic, or whether we should do the right thing and impeach him because it's called justice to send a message to scare all the globalists out there.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:49.181]  Mick in Louisiana, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[00:56:49.462 --> 00:56:51.043]  What's your take on this important question?
[00:56:52.216 --> 00:56:53.457]  Yes, thank you Alex.
[00:56:53.757 --> 00:56:58.360]  I'd like to point out an unsung hero, then I'm going to give my statement on this impeachment.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:12.969]  If you go to CotoCrew, C-O-T-O, Crew, C-R-E-W.wordpress.com, Bob, my new hero, that's CotoCrew, wordpress.com.
[00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:14.970]  Sir, you've got to tell me, you've got to tell me, go ahead.
[00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.450]  There it is.
[00:57:17.785 --> 00:57:20.046]  Yes, I would love to see impeachment.
[00:57:20.086 --> 00:57:21.466]  It would be wonderful.
[00:57:21.506 --> 00:57:30.348]  Yes, it would arouse the liberal base, but more importantly, it would arouse the disenfranchised angry masses.
[00:57:30.548 --> 00:57:32.648]  And that's why we're not going to see it.
[00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:40.510]  They do not want the power elites, do not want to awaken the angry masses, because then both parties would be discredited.
[00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:40.990]  That's right.
[00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:42.931]  They don't want to be brought to justice.
[00:57:43.471 --> 00:57:44.311]  They don't want
[00:57:45.111 --> 00:57:55.618]  The whole can of worms to come out, just like they went after Clinton for lying about sex instead of Laura Allen Hughes' missile secrets to the Chi-Coms, because the Republicans were involved in that as well.
[00:57:56.018 --> 00:57:57.359]  I totally agree with you.
[00:57:57.379 --> 00:57:59.280]  And look, I'm not against people plugging websites.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.961]  It's just giving out web URLs doesn't work.
[00:58:02.422 --> 00:58:07.485]  You want to give out a headline from the website that originates from that website.
[00:58:07.545 --> 00:58:08.746]  That's how you plug stuff.
[00:58:09.606 --> 00:58:11.987]  Uh, so, so that's the best way for people to do that.
[00:58:12.267 --> 00:58:13.808]  Thank you so much, great points, Mick.
[00:58:14.208 --> 00:58:16.869]  Shelby, real fast, to impeach or not to impeach?
[00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:22.570]  We absolutely have to impeach him if we want to continue to call ourselves Christians and Americans.
[00:58:23.231 --> 00:58:35.855]  Um, let's see, here, in his Oath of Office, he says, I do solemnly swear or affirm I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:58:37.218 --> 00:58:44.442]  And the State of the Union address, he says, I tend to keep trying with or without Congress to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters.
[00:58:44.462 --> 00:58:44.983]  Stay there.
[00:58:45.083 --> 00:58:46.363]  I'm going to come back and let you finish.
[00:58:46.383 --> 00:58:46.804]  Stay with us.
[00:58:46.824 --> 00:58:47.224]  We'll be back.
[00:58:50.045 --> 00:58:51.426]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:51.466 --> 00:58:54.128]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.321]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:59:03.421 --> 00:59:04.581]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:59:04.681 --> 00:59:05.742]  God knows what's in this.
[00:59:05.982 --> 00:59:10.083]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:59:10.223 --> 00:59:16.005]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:59:16.145 --> 00:59:17.145]  That one is better.
[00:59:17.205 --> 00:59:18.165]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:59:18.465 --> 00:59:19.866]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:59:19.886 --> 00:59:20.386]  It's good water.
[00:59:20.526 --> 00:59:26.270]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:59:26.491 --> 00:59:33.556]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:36.238]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[00:59:36.438 --> 00:59:44.344]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:59:44.364 --> 00:59:45.505]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:59:45.645 --> 00:59:46.526]  It's good water.
[00:59:46.726 --> 00:59:47.187]  Refreshing.
[00:59:47.207 --> 00:59:47.647]  It's good!

[00:59:55.172 --> 00:59:57.293]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.553 --> 01:00:03.297]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:16.030]  Big Brother.
[01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:17.731]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.471 --> 01:00:19.551]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:21.032]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:22.712]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.352 --> 01:00:26.953]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.533 --> 01:00:31.635]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.615 --> 01:00:38.616]  Obama started out in his administration saying, I can't bypass Congress, but I sure wish I could.
[01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:41.197]  Two, I'm thinking about bypassing Congress, too.
[01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:42.958]  Do you want me to bypass Congress?
[01:00:43.018 --> 01:00:43.778]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.241]  And so they're just setting the precedent for an arbitrary executive.
[01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:50.882]  Shelby, what was your other point?
[01:00:50.942 --> 01:00:52.222]  To impeach or not to impeach?
[01:00:52.663 --> 01:00:56.084]  Boehner says no way, it's a democratic scam.
[01:00:56.504 --> 01:00:59.065]  Well, they are lying and saying impeachment is imminent.
[01:00:59.606 --> 01:01:01.586]  So what Boehner is saying is true to a point.
[01:01:02.707 --> 01:01:08.209]  But impeachment should be on the table and I think we should go ahead with it.
[01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:14.792]  Well, not to, because otherwise we give our implied consent with our silence.
[01:01:15.575 --> 01:01:29.642]  And therefore, when he made that oath, and made an affirmative oath, something, let's see, made a promise that he meant not to fulfill, that is the definition of perjury.
[01:01:30.322 --> 01:01:33.304]  Therefore, there is a case to be made that he has committed perjury.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.262]  Well, I mean, the big impeachment issue is he's failed to execute his duties.
[01:01:40.702 --> 01:01:44.305]  Securing the border is paramount amongst us for the president.
[01:01:44.385 --> 01:01:45.046]  Thank you for the call.
[01:01:45.706 --> 01:01:47.528]  Let's talk to John in Utah.
[01:01:47.568 --> 01:01:48.208]  You're on the air.
[01:01:48.248 --> 01:01:48.569]  Go ahead.
[01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:53.513]  And I think we should impeach Boehner.
[01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:03.290]  And Boehner, because he's holding this up.
[01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:04.030]  That's right.
[01:02:04.951 --> 01:02:09.394]  And I constantly, I've talked to my own congressman several times about this.
[01:02:09.995 --> 01:02:20.603]  His chief of staff says, well, Boehner is sort of handicapped because he has Eastern liberal Republicans that he has to deal with to try to keep everyone in line.
[01:02:21.424 --> 01:02:29.350]  Well, if the articles of impeachment are clearly set forth and no one could deny them,
[01:02:29.975 --> 01:02:46.200]  In the debate that we have in the country, then even the Democratic Senate could not deny the articles.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:55.083]  And they'd have to go along, it seems to me, with the conviction of the impeachment against Barack Obama.
[01:02:55.963 --> 01:02:59.024]  There has to be a surgical strike and it can't wait forever.
[01:02:59.867 --> 01:03:01.488]  It has to be now.
[01:03:02.129 --> 01:03:04.270]  It can't go on and talk about it forever.
[01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:09.014]  Well, that's my big issue is, look at what they're already doing, knowing that no one's stopping them.
[01:03:09.674 --> 01:03:17.360]  If he's already imploded the border, and is funding Al-Qaeda, and is signing executive orders against the Second Amendment, what's he going to do in the next two years?
[01:03:19.501 --> 01:03:20.362]  That's what I say.
[01:03:20.442 --> 01:03:22.804]  I mean, it's got to be quick and swift.
[01:03:23.664 --> 01:03:27.067]  Not this stuff going on and on and on and on in the media.
[01:03:27.765 --> 01:03:29.950]  And, uh, impeach, not impeach, whatever.
[01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:32.235]  Threats here, and it's gotta be quick.
[01:03:32.788 --> 01:03:33.588]  They've got to be serious.
[01:03:33.608 --> 01:03:37.689]  There's got to be some serious people in the House of Representatives to start this.
[01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:43.391]  I've talked to five or six different members of the House who I think would go along with it.
[01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:51.153]  Well, Bob Barr says if he gets back in, and it looks like he will, because he's having a landslide in the polls right now, he will introduce impeachment.
[01:03:51.173 --> 01:03:52.594]  Of course, he did it last time.
[01:03:53.054 --> 01:03:54.074]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:54.454 --> 01:03:56.635]  He's a former federal prosecutor and was a good one.
[01:03:57.035 --> 01:03:57.855]  No corruption there.
[01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:00.176]  And he just says, look, it's the law.
[01:04:00.216 --> 01:04:00.956]  You've got to impeach.
[01:04:01.883 --> 01:04:02.763]  I mean, that's what you do.
[01:04:02.783 --> 01:04:06.084]  You don't go, we're winning a lot of points because he's committing a lot of crime.
[01:04:06.584 --> 01:04:07.944]  Let's let him stay in there.
[01:04:09.505 --> 01:04:10.605]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[01:04:10.665 --> 01:04:11.085]  Go ahead.
[01:04:11.105 --> 01:04:19.387]  Yeah, I think you have to impeach, but there's just, I just see too many, I see a little problem with it.
[01:04:19.527 --> 01:04:23.728]  How far down would we have to go to find someone who's capable?
[01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:27.116]  Of running the country who's not corrupt?
[01:04:27.236 --> 01:04:28.417]  People are waking up.
[01:04:28.437 --> 01:04:29.477]  I see people waking up.
[01:04:29.497 --> 01:04:32.058]  It seems like they're putting it all on Obama instead of realizing that
[01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:50.164]  There's a whole nother government controlling what we proceed to do.
[01:04:50.224 --> 01:04:50.504]  No, no, no.
[01:04:50.644 --> 01:04:51.325]  I agree.
[01:04:51.485 --> 01:04:57.290]  But they need the people in the Congress and the White House to follow the orders and commit the illegal acts.
[01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.051]  So the public only knows the figureheads.
[01:04:59.412 --> 01:05:01.193]  So we put those figureheads in prison.
[01:05:01.213 --> 01:05:04.176]  I tell you, that'll get the government's attention real fast.
[01:05:05.177 --> 01:05:07.319]  I'm telling you, folks, the government's totally criminal.
[01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:08.520]  It's time to start arresting.
[01:05:09.835 --> 01:05:15.798]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:05:15.998 --> 01:05:20.200]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.122]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:05:25.542 --> 01:05:28.164]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:05:28.465 --> 01:05:33.649]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:05:33.909 --> 01:05:40.794]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:05:41.295 --> 01:05:45.058]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:05:45.438 --> 01:05:46.119]  Nobody else.
[01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:50.203]  ...has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:50.543 --> 01:05:58.972]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:05:59.172 --> 01:06:03.197]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:06:03.437 --> 01:06:05.259]  Take advantage of this unprecedented

[01:06:30.636 --> 01:06:35.159]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:43.825]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:06:44.046 --> 01:06:45.987]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:06:46.187 --> 01:06:57.271]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[01:07:09.315 --> 01:07:11.216]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:07:11.556 --> 01:07:19.479]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:26.662]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:07:27.142 --> 01:07:31.384]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:07:31.724 --> 01:07:41.892]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:07:42.352 --> 01:07:48.537]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:51.099]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:07:51.199 --> 01:07:55.062]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:07:55.222 --> 01:07:56.824]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:07:57.164 --> 01:08:01.109]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:14.003]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:17.366]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.122 --> 01:08:31.023]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:31.503 --> 01:08:32.263]  until 2 p.m.
[01:08:32.283 --> 01:08:34.304]  Central, we're here live on the radio.
[01:08:34.424 --> 01:08:35.484]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:36.165 --> 01:08:51.290]  And then, of course, don't forget, we return weeknights, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time with InfoWars Nightly News, hosted by myself and the rest of the crew.
[01:08:52.631 --> 01:08:57.493]  The news websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:58.923 --> 01:09:03.807]  And InfoWars has been around since 1996, Prison Planet since 2000.
[01:09:04.028 --> 01:09:16.719]  We use the InfoWars, the truth, to battle the lies and we're trying to stop the planet from being turned into a giant control grid.
[01:09:17.418 --> 01:09:30.725]  And that's what the technocrats, in Brzezinski's own words, are trying to build is a penal planet, basically, where everyone is treated as guilty until proven innocent.
[01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:31.686]  But it's beyond that.
[01:09:32.366 --> 01:09:34.247]  This is a totalitarian system.
[01:09:35.068 --> 01:09:40.631]  And joining us until 50 after, and you will take your phone calls at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:40.691 --> 01:09:46.094]  We'll clear out some phone lines here later and take some calls for William Binney.
[01:09:47.045 --> 01:09:54.550]  He's the former technical leader for intelligence with the National Security Agency before becoming a whistleblower in late 2001.
[01:09:55.130 --> 01:10:01.915]  After more than 30 years with the agency, Benny has been described as one of the best analysts and codebreakers in NSA history.
[01:10:02.455 --> 01:10:10.321]  Benny continues to speak out about the NSA's data collection policies and continues to do interviews in media regarding his experiences
[01:10:11.141 --> 01:10:14.483]  And communication intercepts by governmental agencies of American citizens.
[01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:21.769]  In a legal case, Benny has testified in an affidavit that the NSA is in deliberate violation of the U.S.
[01:10:22.169 --> 01:10:23.029]  Constitution.
[01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:27.753]  ExposedFacts.org is one site where you can read some of his writings.
[01:10:28.733 --> 01:10:33.157]  Two weeks ago, in the London Guardian, they ran a story about him testifying to the German Parliament.
[01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:36.274]  And a German intelligence surveillance inquiry.
[01:10:37.075 --> 01:10:41.401]  The headline was, the ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control.
[01:10:42.082 --> 01:10:48.931]  At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in U.S., says whistleblower William Binney.
[01:10:49.692 --> 01:10:51.614]  That's a totalitarian mentality.
[01:10:52.435 --> 01:11:08.920]  In another interview he described it as we are now in a police state and we now take you to the highest ranking ever NSA or period intelligence whistleblower from the highest levels to break down what's really going on.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.962]  William Binney, thank you so much for your courageous action in defense of free civilization.
[01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.503]  Well thank you and thanks for having me.
[01:11:17.848 --> 01:11:26.931]  You know, there's so many places to go here, sir, but first off, just seven, eight years ago, Bush would get up and say, we don't listen to any Americans without warrants.
[01:11:27.431 --> 01:11:28.331]  It's preposterous.
[01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:32.973]  Eight years later, okay, we listen to everything you do, but it's for your own good.
[01:11:33.513 --> 01:11:46.477]  Describe what we're facing here and where you see things going, because my concern is, thanks to you and others, we know about the level of deception now, but now it's almost like a mainlining of this.
[01:11:48.516 --> 01:11:58.059]  Yeah, the real problem is that when you gather all kinds of information like this on everybody in the planet, that gives you leverage to blackmail anybody you want.
[01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:02.160]  And like the KGB, this is the kind of stuff that they did.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:08.122]  I mean, the point is that if they can't get at you directly, they can try to get at somebody that you care about.
[01:12:08.842 --> 01:12:13.003]  Someone in your family or someone that you're really interested in protecting.
[01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:19.100]  And so that's some of the techniques that I think are now possible with all the information that they've assembled.
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:35.949]  And they're using the FBI to look at it, to do things like find something that would leverage and get Petraeus, or General Petraeus, or Allen out of office, or look at how to get rid of Eliot Spitzer, who was going after the bankers after that colossal banking failure in 2008.
[01:12:37.695 --> 01:12:44.038]  Something that would help protect the interest that you have and yet get rid of your opponents or people you don't particularly care to have around.
[01:12:47.339 --> 01:12:49.940]  Total control beyond the Stasi.
[01:12:52.201 --> 01:13:05.967]  I want to talk about, I mean I know you can't get into classified things that you were involved in, but I've talked to Wayne Madsen and other NSA whistleblowers and he said that back when he was in the agency they really didn't spy on people illegally.
[01:13:07.029 --> 01:13:10.590]  And that there has been a real change and a real shift.
[01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:11.990]  Is that accurate?
[01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:14.791]  And fill folks in on why you left in 2001.
[01:13:14.851 --> 01:13:23.913]  Well, first I left in 2001, in October, once I found out that they were spying on everybody in the United States.
[01:13:24.893 --> 01:13:28.053]  That meant they were pulling in, initially, this was the first draft.
[01:13:28.113 --> 01:13:30.674]  I mean, I'd been working the Soviet Union for almost 30 years.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:43.585]  And the KGB and the NVD were really, they focused in on getting all kinds of information they possibly could on their population as well as anybody in the world that they could use that, and they could use that information as leverage against them.
[01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:47.227]  This was a standard tactic to use in espionage.
[01:13:47.987 --> 01:13:50.508]  So, and the Stasi was no different in East Germany.
[01:13:50.548 --> 01:13:51.529]  They did the same thing.
[01:13:52.579 --> 01:13:58.181]  Except they didn't do it anywhere near as complete and as accurate and as timely as we do it.
[01:13:58.681 --> 01:14:04.223]  So, when they started that with the telecoms, pulling in all the data and the telephoning of every U.S.
[01:14:04.283 --> 01:14:14.487]  citizen as well as everybody else they could in the world, that simply meant to me that they had no respect whatsoever for the oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution.
[01:14:14.527 --> 01:14:16.948]  In fact, they scrapped the Constitution.
[01:14:17.751 --> 01:14:19.193]  So, and that's what I saw.
[01:14:19.233 --> 01:14:24.198]  And they did it under the guise of Article 2 War Powers Act that President Bush was claiming.
[01:14:24.319 --> 01:14:29.965]  Well, in fact, I kept asking the lawyers that I had and others, I said, what war are we in?
[01:14:30.125 --> 01:14:31.447]  When did Congress declare war?
[01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:32.848]  And the answer is, they didn't.
[01:14:33.349 --> 01:14:36.893]  And so therefore, he could not, in fact, claim War Powers Act.
[01:14:37.498 --> 01:14:42.483]  So, they were all doing it on a false premise, and everybody bought into that because we'd just been attacked.
[01:14:42.903 --> 01:15:02.422]  Then they were all afraid of getting another attack, and instead of using discipline and analysis and focused disciplined analysis to find the bad guys and go after them and get them and stop them, they went to this bulk acquisition of data on everybody, which simply inundated them with information.
[01:15:03.143 --> 01:15:11.551]  And unless they focused in on a target in that bulk data, they couldn't find anything else in the grand scheme of things because it was just too much data to look at.
[01:15:11.631 --> 01:15:14.374]  No human or set of humans could possibly do it.
[01:15:15.435 --> 01:15:21.681]  So if you were doing something they didn't like, they could focus on you and go after you with all this data.
[01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:32.931]  If you were trying to detect terrorism around the world in this bulk data acquisition environment, you were buried and you couldn't find them.
[01:15:35.492 --> 01:15:37.093]  That's really the problems that I see.
[01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:38.973]  I mean, they were making themselves dysfunctional.
[01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:40.654]  They couldn't actually protect us anymore.
[01:15:41.114 --> 01:15:58.378]  And they were violating our constitutional rights and throwing away our privacy, when in fact they could have maintained all the privacy of everyone in the world, focused an attack on unknown terrorists and bad guys in zones of suspicion around them, and done a real, focused, disciplined attack to stop these things and succeed it.
[01:15:58.458 --> 01:16:01.299]  Instead, they took this bulk approach and failed.
[01:16:03.154 --> 01:16:08.036]  William Benny, the top NSA whistleblower in history, joins us.
[01:16:08.276 --> 01:16:14.238]  ExposedFacts.org is the whistleblower website where you can read some of his specific writings.
[01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:27.862]  You know, I've been politically involved promoting liberty for 20 years on air now, and I personally have had repercussions that have even come out in the newspapers by the FBI and others.
[01:16:29.605 --> 01:16:35.892]  And when you get on a White House enemies list and it comes out in the newspapers, it's surreal.
[01:16:36.553 --> 01:16:47.905]  And I personally have covered secret government conferences like Bilderberg, and then had them call my wife, no number comes up on the phone, and, you know, say, I hope your dad dies.
[01:16:48.902 --> 01:16:49.903]  I don't think so.
[01:17:09.831 --> 01:17:14.980]  Police are using databases to harass people in New York over the white flags last week.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:20.688]  They now admit they're pulling everyone's cell phone data basically in the city to track who was where.
[01:17:22.506 --> 01:17:26.569]  I mean, this is ubiquitous now that it's being used for political control.
[01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:43.764]  And then we learn, from Seattle, Washington, to Chicago, Illinois, to Austin, Texas, there's been a covert 15-year program that we first broke, discovering the Federal Purchase Orders and grants, to put microphones up listening to people on street corners.
[01:17:45.324 --> 01:17:48.947]  It's just the sky's the limit now of this Orwellian system.
[01:17:49.147 --> 01:17:57.714]  Have you ever, Mr. Benny, or do you know of others that have been targeted and harassed using the NSA systems?
[01:17:58.815 --> 01:18:07.161]  Well, I know I have because I've been in the sworn affidavit they've signed against us, the group of NSA whistleblowers.
[01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:13.534]  Uh, they claimed that they had a recording of a phone call that I told them about, which I know I didn't tell them about.
[01:18:13.594 --> 01:18:19.039]  So they, that was basically, uh, they were exposing the warrantless wiretap they had on it.
[01:18:19.099 --> 01:18:25.183]  So, so they were doing that to us and, uh, and, uh, they were, I mean, they were doing it to all kinds of people calling.
[01:18:25.243 --> 01:18:35.731]  I mean, Thomas Tam, who is the, who is the DOJ, uh, attorney preparing a warrant request for the FISA court detected some of this warrantless wiretapping back in 2003, 2004.
[01:18:38.351 --> 01:18:44.753]  And he was one of the sources for the New York Times exposure of the warrantless wiretapping program.
[01:18:45.653 --> 01:18:51.194]  And so he recognized that they were violating the constitutional rights of everybody and violating the law.
[01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:57.696]  In fact, he on Frontline in a recent broadcast said that this was a federal felony that they were committing.
[01:18:58.936 --> 01:19:04.218]  And there was a time there back at that period of time when they thought maybe the Attorney General would be indicted.
[01:19:05.242 --> 01:19:06.643]  That was Ashcroft at the time.
[01:19:06.743 --> 01:19:12.527]  So, you know, they've known that this has been the kind of tactics and techniques they've been using all along.
[01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:19.112]  And in the process, what they do is they fabricate evidence, they go around and do a parallel construction to get
[01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:25.414]  Like, using normal policing techniques to try to find the data, they already know where it is, so that makes it pretty easy, you know?
[01:19:25.954 --> 01:19:35.261]  And so then they go get it through normal policing techniques, then substitute that for the NSA collection as the basis for arresting people to submit that data in court.
[01:19:35.862 --> 01:19:38.924]  Which means they're perjuring themselves in court every time they do that.
[01:19:40.079 --> 01:19:45.623]  You know, and simply subverting our entire judicial process as they're executing.
[01:19:45.703 --> 01:19:51.947]  I mean, I call this a planned program perjury policy run by the Department of Justice of the United States.
[01:19:53.068 --> 01:19:56.510]  Is it not, by the very definition, organized crime, racketeering?
[01:19:58.132 --> 01:19:59.432]  I would think of it that way, yes.
[01:20:00.942 --> 01:20:13.211]  It's a kingpin operation, because if you study kingpin operations from Sicily right through to modern times, using the Italian model, which even goes back to Caesar, you corrupt people.
[01:20:13.811 --> 01:20:16.814]  It's not just getting them to take the money or getting them to violate the law.
[01:20:17.234 --> 01:20:23.218]  Now you can blackmail the DEA agents, the FBI, the Secret Service, and everyone else.
[01:20:23.578 --> 01:20:29.403]  You can also plant fake data on them without even using the sneak-and-peek provision of the Patriot Act.
[01:20:30.183 --> 01:20:35.849]  And it is bigger than just spying on everyone, or ruining and muddying all the intelligence waters.
[01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:47.301]  It's a chilling effect, but it's also a mass-corrupting program, where now... I mean, I've talked to local police years ago that were in the Threat Fusion Center, and they said, no, we can listen to you right now.
[01:20:47.782 --> 01:20:51.306]  So then select police are being brought in and federalized.
[01:20:51.906 --> 01:20:53.847]  And allowed to get into the Palantir system.
[01:20:53.867 --> 01:21:02.131]  I mean, right now, I think they're using the cover of NSA coming out, Mr. Penney, to actually hide it in plain view.
[01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:09.694]  And if we don't reverse this revolution of Big Brother, it will now be standardized.
[01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:11.975]  Do you get my finer point there?
[01:21:12.515 --> 01:21:13.015]  Yes, I do.
[01:21:13.096 --> 01:21:15.116]  And in fact, I agree totally with it.
[01:21:15.176 --> 01:21:20.639]  And as an example, you could use Nancy Pelosi when she was Speaker of the House.
[01:21:21.613 --> 01:21:25.276]  If you recall when she said that impeaching George Bush is off the table?
[01:21:27.178 --> 01:21:27.418]  Yes.
[01:21:27.718 --> 01:21:28.459]  If you remember that?
[01:21:28.919 --> 01:21:33.743]  Well, the point was that she was co-opted into that program in October of 2001.
[01:21:34.143 --> 01:21:46.493]  She was the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, and at that time the chair and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees were the only ones in Congress briefed on this program.
[01:21:46.533 --> 01:21:49.315]  That was, I think, around the 4th of October of 2001.
[01:21:50.848 --> 01:21:55.773]  And she bought into those programs as well as other similar programs at the CIA.
[01:21:56.513 --> 01:22:02.919]  Which meant that George Bush could say, if you want to impeach me, you have to impeach yourself because you're a part of this, you're culpable of this.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:07.463]  So that's the leverage that he had against her.
[01:22:07.483 --> 01:22:11.287]  So that leverage is the game they're playing.
[01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:19.834]  It really is the ultimate form of discrimination by a ruling class in the Soviet Union, in Eastern Germany.
[01:22:20.575 --> 01:22:23.156]  The British, of course, wrote the book on this, as you know.
[01:22:23.876 --> 01:22:28.399]  To gobble up everything, create files on everything,
[01:22:29.617 --> 01:22:33.841]  And then use it to politically persecute who you want.
[01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:42.288]  But then beyond that, only the establishment and select corporations that are part of it are given access to it.
[01:22:42.688 --> 01:22:48.553]  They then use the data, not even against political enemies, but to consolidate the economy.
[01:22:50.034 --> 01:23:04.339]  It's unfair trade practices, it's the end of the free market, and then you find out it's been an organized telecommunications plan since the early 90s and the Telecommunications Act of 96 to put these hubs in everywhere.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.940]  You were there at the NSA at that time.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:16.044]  I mean, weren't people concerned, like James Bamfrano wrote about it, when it was obvious that they were putting in this real-time surveillance?
[01:23:17.389 --> 01:23:30.452]  Well, I think the issue goes back, and this is probably what Jim was referring back to, was back in the Nixon days when he had NSA with their program Minaret and FBI with COINTELPRO and CIA with CHAOS.
[01:23:31.158 --> 01:23:42.766]  All collaborating to spy on enemies of the Nixon administration, those opposing the war, Martin Luther King, John Lennon, and various other people in the country.
[01:23:43.267 --> 01:23:45.968]  At the time, you see, the problem was they could only do so much.
[01:23:46.369 --> 01:23:49.731]  They only had so much effort, so they could only handle maybe a couple thousand people.
[01:23:50.652 --> 01:23:58.077]  But now, with the new technologies, that gives you the capability to do everybody in the country, in fact, most people in the world.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:03.623]  Which means you're monitoring hundreds of millions if not billions of people every day.
[01:24:04.403 --> 01:24:08.666]  So that's the kind of leverage that this kind of technology gives them.
[01:24:09.626 --> 01:24:12.968]  What Nixon did was an infinitesimal of what they're doing now.
[01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:14.729]  That's the whole point of it.
[01:24:14.849 --> 01:24:15.910]  And Nixon got impeached.
[01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.871]  Those were the articles of impeachment against him.
[01:24:18.491 --> 01:24:20.632]  And we're sitting here doing nothing about it.
[01:24:22.921 --> 01:24:27.963]  You've exposed the parallel construction that was in Reuters last August.
[01:24:28.043 --> 01:24:28.984]  Exclusive U.S.
[01:24:29.004 --> 01:24:38.768]  directs agents to cover a program used to investigate Americans where they're drag netting the phone records, the phone calls of people selling each other marijuana and things like that.
[01:24:39.148 --> 01:24:42.769]  They selectively leave the big cartels alone, the big banks laundering the money.
[01:24:43.129 --> 01:24:44.170]  They then farm out
[01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:50.834]  The data to the DEA, who then farms it out to the Threat Fusion Centers and to local police.
[01:24:51.394 --> 01:25:10.045]  What this is really doing, larger than just parallel construction and the fraud of the judicial system, is it's the federalization of the police because they're only given access to the select data trails that the feds want them to go after, hence shutting up a system of selective enforcement.
[01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:11.046]  That's correct.
[01:25:11.666 --> 01:25:21.110]  And also, there was a quote from a Reuters article last year from a federal agent who said, this is such a great program, I just hope we can keep it secret.
[01:25:22.311 --> 01:25:26.913]  Well, you know, you don't get an informed electorate or anything in a democracy that way.
[01:25:26.973 --> 01:25:28.314]  I mean, that's a secret government.
[01:25:29.814 --> 01:25:30.374]  Unbelievable.
[01:25:30.635 --> 01:25:36.057]  I know there's a lot you can't talk about because of national security agreements and letters, but
[01:25:37.418 --> 01:25:50.148]  We've seen Cybele Edmonds, a whistleblower from the FBI NSA side, breaking the gag order and exposing the fact that our government was basically manipulating and handling and protecting Al Qaeda right up until 9-11.
[01:25:51.068 --> 01:25:57.954]  Now we see ISIS, IS, Al Qaeda being armed to attack Syria, allowed into Libya.
[01:25:59.014 --> 01:26:01.456]  The very group we're told we have the NSA to fight.
[01:26:03.138 --> 01:26:05.980]  What is your view on Cybele Edmonds and people like her?
[01:26:07.816 --> 01:26:11.299]  Well, I think she certainly pointed out some very important things that we need to pay attention to.
[01:26:11.319 --> 01:26:20.948]  I mean, and again, I think that the general population probably is not as actively involved as it should be, by any means.
[01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:27.915]  So, I mean, you need to tell these people what they're doing is just a violation of our fundamental rights.
[01:26:28.095 --> 01:26:33.480]  You need to say, if you don't straighten up and start to do the right thing next election, I'm firing you.
[01:26:34.736 --> 01:26:36.398]  I mean, that's what you've got to do with these people.
[01:26:36.418 --> 01:26:38.219]  You have to tell them outright, you're fired.
[01:26:48.666 --> 01:26:49.827]  You know, speak to the American people.
[01:26:49.907 --> 01:26:56.030]  Millions of folks out there about a plan of action, how you think we turn this around, and other points.
[01:26:56.070 --> 01:27:04.214]  And we're going to give listeners an opportunity to tweet their questions at RealAlexJones on Twitter at
[01:27:06.667 --> 01:27:07.107]  I think so.
[01:27:27.546 --> 01:27:29.086]  to begin to warn the American people.
[01:27:29.126 --> 01:27:30.207]  First he warned Congress.
[01:27:30.587 --> 01:27:31.247]  Nothing happened.
[01:27:31.287 --> 01:27:36.549]  Now he's warning folks publicly and warning the German government, the British government, and others.
[01:27:36.589 --> 01:27:49.592]  William Benny is our guest, so send your questions there to RealAlexJones on Twitter at hashtag IWChats, and we will take those questions coming up in the next segment.
[01:27:49.652 --> 01:27:56.074]  But other points that you think are important for listeners out there to be aware of, Mr. Benny?
[01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:03.657]  Well, I mean, I look at this as a fundamental destruction of our democracy.
[01:28:04.017 --> 01:28:05.438]  I mean, this is really what's going on.
[01:28:05.458 --> 01:28:07.580]  They're destroying the foundation of this country.
[01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:11.503]  And in the process, they're doing it around the world.
[01:28:11.563 --> 01:28:12.845]  I mean, it's not just limited here.
[01:28:12.885 --> 01:28:16.828]  What they do is they use this data around the world for law enforcement.
[01:28:17.566 --> 01:28:18.906]  And they use it to leverage people.
[01:28:18.966 --> 01:28:29.749]  I mean, that's one of the things that I tried to warn people about all around is that this kind of gathering of information exposes everybody to forms of pressure or coercion.
[01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:46.734]  And so, I mean, those are the real, I mean, it's showing really the frailty of human beings and how they tend to use, once you give them knowledge and that really is power, once you give them that power, one way or another, they tend to use it sooner or later.
[01:28:47.396 --> 01:28:55.119]  And so the point is you need to have a real rigorous way of managing and making sure that they can't do it without being exposed.
[01:28:55.599 --> 01:28:56.579]  We don't have that now.
[01:28:56.679 --> 01:29:03.322]  What they do with whistleblowers is they attack them, they put them in jail, they do all kinds of things to discredit them and everything.
[01:29:03.362 --> 01:29:11.804]  They use the KGB tactics of saying they're mentally impaired or they're disgruntled employees or we need to put them away or something like that.
[01:29:13.692 --> 01:29:18.716]  You can't believe the narrative you're getting out of the administration or the White House without challenge.
[01:29:18.756 --> 01:29:24.181]  And if you don't challenge it, then you know you're just swallowing the line that they're feeding you.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.541]  By 1939, people knew Hitler was bad, but what do you do?
[01:29:31.582 --> 01:29:32.342]  He's in charge.
[01:29:33.142 --> 01:29:38.725]  It's the same thing with this bureaucracy and these corporate interests that are heavily hooked into the NSA and other agencies.
[01:29:39.506 --> 01:29:42.087]  They're just operating criminally out in the open now.
[01:29:42.467 --> 01:29:43.748]  They're not getting in trouble.
[01:29:44.368 --> 01:29:49.731]  And every time we say, hey, get back under control, they say, hey, let us spy on you or terrorists will attack you.
[01:29:50.312 --> 01:29:53.553]  Meanwhile, the border's wide open and the government's funding ISIS.
[01:29:53.633 --> 01:29:54.654]  It just doesn't hold water.
[01:29:54.954 --> 01:29:56.135]  So what's the next step?
[01:29:56.215 --> 01:29:57.876]  We'll talk to William Binney, straight ahead.
[01:29:58.436 --> 01:30:01.439]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.459 --> 01:30:05.082]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.122 --> 01:30:07.144]  Tell your friends and family, tune in folks, this is important.
[01:30:10.747 --> 01:30:13.309]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:13.529 --> 01:30:18.193]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[01:30:18.213 --> 01:30:20.215]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:30.427]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[01:30:30.447 --> 01:30:31.869]  There's only 500 of each.
[01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:36.216]  We're talking about Made in America belt buckles in nickel brass.
[01:30:36.316 --> 01:30:38.399]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[01:30:38.579 --> 01:30:41.504]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[01:30:41.704 --> 01:30:53.153]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free, right now, when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv, for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[01:30:53.453 --> 01:30:56.976]  That's more than five months free, off the regular price.
[01:30:57.316 --> 01:31:03.561]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July, at MadeIn1776.com.
[01:31:03.962 --> 01:31:09.026]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[01:31:10.683 --> 01:31:11.823]  I didn't like taste dirt in it.
[01:31:11.924 --> 01:31:13.004]  God knows what's in this.
[01:31:13.264 --> 01:31:17.365]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:31:17.545 --> 01:31:23.428]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:31:23.548 --> 01:31:24.568]  That one is better.
[01:31:24.628 --> 01:31:25.608]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:31:25.888 --> 01:31:27.269]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[01:31:27.449 --> 01:31:27.869]  It's good water.
[01:31:27.969 --> 01:31:33.793]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:31:34.033 --> 01:31:41.157]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[01:31:41.357 --> 01:31:43.899]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[01:31:44.079 --> 01:31:52.104]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:31:52.124 --> 01:31:53.545]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:31:53.585 --> 01:31:54.345]  It's good water.
[01:31:54.525 --> 01:31:54.966]  Refreshing.
[01:31:55.126 --> 01:31:55.446]  It's good!

[01:32:03.881 --> 01:32:04.382]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:11.147 --> 01:32:12.208]  In the near future.
[01:32:12.488 --> 01:32:16.131]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:16.151 --> 01:32:16.632]  Security alert.
[01:32:16.972 --> 01:32:17.973]  Security alert.
[01:32:18.193 --> 01:32:19.934]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:20.214 --> 01:32:20.835]  Analysis.
[01:32:21.115 --> 01:32:21.736]  InfoWars.
[01:32:21.816 --> 01:32:23.897]  Building independent media operations.
[01:32:23.917 --> 01:32:28.761]  Let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:28.801 --> 01:32:29.702]  Prime Directive.
[01:32:29.842 --> 01:32:31.203]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:31.383 --> 01:32:34.166]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:34.246 --> 01:32:37.308]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:37.468 --> 01:32:39.710]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:40.511]  These people are a
[01:32:40.711 --> 01:32:42.671]  They're never going to stop.
[01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:49.953]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:32:49.973 --> 01:33:04.476]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:33:04.496 --> 01:33:06.117]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:33:06.157 --> 01:33:06.877]  You can feel it.
[01:33:14.344 --> 01:33:20.627]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.308 --> 01:33:25.490]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:27.711]  I work from nine to five.
[01:33:28.051 --> 01:33:29.392]  Hell, I pay the price.
[01:33:30.072 --> 01:33:33.314]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[01:33:33.834 --> 01:33:37.236]  But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?
[01:33:37.356 --> 01:33:38.617]  And I always feel
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:48.305]  Obviously there's a lot of schizophrenics out there who are paranoid delusionals.
[01:33:50.327 --> 01:33:58.093]  And it must be hellish for them that now we openly live in a Big Brother society and someone really is watching them.
[01:33:59.714 --> 01:34:04.458]  But the establishment doesn't care about the poor schizophrenics at the bus stop talking to themselves.
[01:34:04.879 --> 01:34:06.920]  They care about the patent you're coming out with.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:10.823]  They care about the fact that you saw the senator beating his wife.
[01:34:11.809 --> 01:34:15.971]  They want to know that you saw a drug shipment being flown into Mena, Arkansas.
[01:34:16.531 --> 01:34:26.155]  This allows the criminals in government, in the organized crime networks that have infested it, to basically get away with bloody murder.
[01:34:27.636 --> 01:34:30.157]  And I've interviewed so many CIA whistleblowers.
[01:34:31.857 --> 01:34:33.278]  I've interviewed so many
[01:34:36.434 --> 01:34:42.841]  Defense Intelligence whistleblowers, Delta Force whistleblowers, CIA contractor whistleblowers.
[01:34:43.682 --> 01:34:44.703]  It makes national news.
[01:34:44.723 --> 01:34:45.564]  You've heard them here.
[01:34:46.105 --> 01:34:47.627]  But a lot of this comes out on C-SPAN.
[01:34:49.312 --> 01:34:54.274]  But now with Edward Snowden and William Benny and others, there's no denying it.
[01:34:54.994 --> 01:35:04.597]  So there's this paradox that I was talking about earlier of where they've denied all this is happening, now it's admitted, but they say, hey, you better let us do this or terrorists will get you.
[01:35:05.237 --> 01:35:11.860]  But then meanwhile, they're aiding and abetting radical Wahhabis all over the world in a destabilization program.
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.340]  William Benny is our guest.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:15.561]  The toll-free number to talk to him is 800-259-9231.
[01:35:19.878 --> 01:35:21.360]  Please call with a question for him.
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:25.365]  We won't screen your call, but just ask a brief question so we can get a couple of your calls in.
[01:35:25.385 --> 01:35:25.905]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:26.006 --> 01:35:33.455]  And the tweet questions are coming in at RealAlexJones as well.
[01:35:33.795 --> 01:35:35.958]  We'll get to some of those here in a moment.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:53.352]  How do they get people into government that will engage in classical Soviet-style intimidation of the Associated Press, of Fox News, dossiers on DrudgeReport.com, on Infowars.com, that's come out in four-year requests.
[01:35:53.952 --> 01:35:54.452]  How do they...
[01:35:55.433 --> 01:36:05.999]  Get people to listen to your phone and then call your family member up and tell them they were listening to private conversations to mess with their minds as has happened to me on six or seven occasions.
[01:36:06.639 --> 01:36:13.283]  How do they get the governing class to engage in truly totalitarian activities?
[01:36:15.684 --> 01:36:22.328]  Most people I knew at NSA were all very patriotic, conscientious,
[01:36:23.191 --> 01:36:27.574]  You know, hard-working people who believe in the Constitution, the rights of individuals.
[01:36:28.575 --> 01:36:33.659]  But the problem was a lot of them, about 85% of them, were introverted type people.
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.823]  And that's come out by studies they've done on the population at NSA.
[01:36:39.544 --> 01:36:46.889]  They're on the Myers-Briggs scale, they're ISTJs, introverted, sensing, technical, judgmental kind of people.
[01:36:47.770 --> 01:36:50.452]  And so that's an easy class to intimidate.
[01:36:51.511 --> 01:36:53.371]  And that's basically what the government's been doing.
[01:36:53.412 --> 01:36:54.172]  They've been intimidating.
[01:36:54.212 --> 01:37:12.236]  That's why the Tom Drake trial was... They tried to make an open accusation against Tom Drake in public so that they could... What they were doing was telling the rest of the population of the workforce that if you blow the whistle on us, we are going to come after you with everything we've got.
[01:37:12.716 --> 01:37:18.038]  And that's exactly... They showed, for example, the 60 Minutes program that was done back in May of 2011.
[01:37:19.781 --> 01:37:19.961]  Yeah.
[01:37:37.964 --> 01:37:42.809]  It's a group of people who fundamentally are interested in or concerned about keeping their jobs.
[01:37:42.869 --> 01:37:43.910]  They've got families.
[01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:45.392]  They've got, you know, bills.
[01:37:45.452 --> 01:37:47.594]  They want to send their kids to college.
[01:37:47.614 --> 01:37:50.978]  They have all of those kinds of things, and it's all depending on them keeping a job.
[01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:57.625]  And so that's what they were doing there, is threatening them with their job and even their livelihood and their freedom.
[01:37:58.396 --> 01:38:13.747]  And that's fundamentally what they did internally in NSA and other places, and they later on, like right now, they're instituting programs internally in NSA to say, see something, say something, which means they're having the workforce spy against each other, just like they did in East Germany with the Stasi.
[01:38:13.767 --> 01:38:18.030]  So it's the same, it's the same whole, it's the same principles.
[01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:22.873]  They're applying those principles universally to intimidate people so they'll stay quiet.
[01:38:24.054 --> 01:38:28.097]  And that's how they keep them, that's how they get them to do what they want.
[01:38:28.775 --> 01:38:32.657]  Now, there's a certain portion of the population who loves doing violent things.
[01:38:32.797 --> 01:38:48.066]  I mean, that's the kind of thing that you can find those kinds of people anywhere, and they tend to use them the way they will against, like, for example, threatening you or threatening other people, and they start threatening them physically, too.
[01:38:50.973 --> 01:38:57.919]  Wow, William Benny, top NSA whistleblower, is here live on air with us on the radio and TV at Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[01:38:57.939 --> 01:38:59.300]  The questions are pouring in.
[01:39:00.141 --> 01:39:06.486]  Mr. Benny, one of those questions is, when do you think the endgame is coming?
[01:39:06.506 --> 01:39:09.409]  That's from Ernie Ciarola on Twitter.
[01:39:09.949 --> 01:39:11.590]  When do you think the endgame is coming?
[01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:15.534]  And I would ask you, what is the endgame of this total surveillance society?
[01:39:18.223 --> 01:39:34.610]  Well, it seems to me that they're tending toward a European-style government, or even more leaning toward a Stasi-type government, a Stasi-run government, where the intelligence service basically determines a lot of the policy of the government.
[01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:35.830]  And that's what's happening here.
[01:39:36.611 --> 01:39:46.595]  The intelligence community is more or less directing what the government is doing and how they do it, and it's basically affecting everything, even international decisions like
[01:39:47.922 --> 01:39:57.491]  They used them, I guess, to start the war in Iraq, you know, and they used that kind of information back in the Tonkin Gulf for the Vietnam War.
[01:39:57.671 --> 01:40:10.243]  All that kind of stuff is influencing, trying to influence how the government's doing, and they're getting much more and more involved, and it's building a much larger empire with contractors all around the country, and over, you know, a couple million of them.
[01:40:10.363 --> 01:40:10.964]  I mean, it's not...
[01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:16.773]  The Washington Post did a series of free articles on Top Secret America.
[01:40:16.813 --> 01:40:25.220]  That was a rather good article that laid out this bureaucracy that's been built up since 9-11 all around the country, and in fact, around the world.
[01:40:26.101 --> 01:40:37.150]  I mean, well, when you push up to $100 billion into the intelligence community every year, I mean, that gets to approaching a trillion dollars now that they've spent on this since 9-11.
[01:40:38.772 --> 01:40:44.094]  That's the kind of thing that builds a bureaucracy that tends to need to feed and continue feeding.
[01:40:44.434 --> 01:40:44.914]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:45.134 --> 01:40:49.936]  And so that just continues and perpetuates itself, and they try to gain more and more influence.
[01:40:49.976 --> 01:41:03.382]  Like, for example, it came out recently that even when they were running Minaret at the NSA, one of the people they hit from the fact that they were spying on them was Senator Church, and he was running the investigation against them.
[01:41:05.083 --> 01:41:08.826]  I mean, it shows you that they have the capacity to do these kinds of things in secret.
[01:41:08.886 --> 01:41:23.579]  And Russ Tice has also come out and testified that they were spying on members of Congress and also, you know, members of the military, the senior ranking generals, as well as the members of the Supreme Court.
[01:41:23.799 --> 01:41:27.262]  And then they use that when they want to destroy him to show they've got a mistress or a girlfriend.
[01:41:27.342 --> 01:41:28.483]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:41:28.943 --> 01:41:29.784]  And this is...
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:41.865]  The bureaucracy, the military industrial complex, illegally using data for political takeover, as we know has come out in England, where Parliament is secretly being spied on.
[01:41:41.905 --> 01:41:52.049]  They then use dirt on Parliament to make them vote to continue the illegal spying that makes the Rupert Murdoch phone hacking scandal look like child's play.
[01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:55.991]  I mean, this is just unbelievable, the ramifications of this.
[01:41:58.257 --> 01:42:11.629]  Yeah, I mean, that's why I was saying, they have this, collecting all this bulk data gives them the ability to find information on anybody in the world and therefore use that as leverage or blackmail against either them or someone they care about.
[01:42:12.449 --> 01:42:16.833]  So, and that's how you leverage people, that's the standard KGB tactics for doing it.
[01:42:17.353 --> 01:42:24.480]  So you spent 30 years fighting the KGB, William Benny's our guest, and now we are becoming the KGB.
[01:42:26.443 --> 01:42:27.623]  Simply astounding.
[01:42:27.763 --> 01:42:31.824]  Another question comes in from the Dead Reds.
[01:42:32.345 --> 01:42:40.847]  He says, is there a wake-up, at Real Alex Jones on Twitter, is there a wake-up inside NSA, good people within, wanting to make a change?
[01:42:40.887 --> 01:42:53.870]  I think you kind of already answered that earlier, saying that yes, they use the NSA system and have a whole NSA division that's come out to spy on the employees, not to stop foreign espionage, but to stop people from exposing crime.
[01:42:56.593 --> 01:42:57.033]  Amazing.
[01:42:57.954 --> 01:43:10.898]  Continuing, if we can't rely on elected politicians, asks CWED762, when all is lost, do you believe we can rely on military rebellion to help in reconstruction?
[01:43:11.439 --> 01:43:11.979]  William Benning.
[01:43:13.699 --> 01:43:23.463]  Well, I think there's going to be a fundamental revolution coming, because I think, at least from my sense of it, is that people in America here are starting to wake up to this threat.
[01:43:23.503 --> 01:43:25.904]  They're starting to realize the dangers of what's going on.
[01:43:26.781 --> 01:43:35.545]  And I think that that's going to be a ground-based, from the bottom up, revolution that's going to push these people to do the right thing.
[01:43:36.045 --> 01:43:37.826]  I mean, otherwise, I think we ought to fire them.
[01:43:38.466 --> 01:43:43.288]  I mean, after all, they are the ones that got us to where we are, and we are here because of them.
[01:43:43.408 --> 01:43:44.369]  They should be fired.
[01:43:44.929 --> 01:43:45.329]  That's all.
[01:43:46.092 --> 01:43:46.833]  That's the way I look at it.
[01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:49.634]  And then we should have a special prosecutor come back and clean it up.
[01:43:50.055 --> 01:43:51.215]  I mean, we have to do this.
[01:43:51.255 --> 01:43:54.357]  We have to hold these people accountable or else it's going to continue.
[01:43:54.417 --> 01:43:58.660]  Like, for example, I blame this all on Jerry Ford because Jerry Ford pardoned Nixon.
[01:43:59.241 --> 01:44:00.441]  Nixon was already indicted.
[01:44:00.461 --> 01:44:04.544]  He was going to go into court and then Ford pardoned him.
[01:44:04.584 --> 01:44:06.185]  That's why I didn't vote for him, by the way.
[01:44:06.205 --> 01:44:11.269]  I voted for Jimmy Carter because he pardoned Nixon.
[01:44:11.489 --> 01:44:13.330]  I mean, that was the ultimate insult.
[01:44:14.033 --> 01:44:22.708]  I mean, he, what he was trying to do, what he did effectively was say, the president is above the law, his get out of jail free card is the next president.
[01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:27.637]  And that meant that things could only get worse since then, and that's what's happened.
[01:44:28.763 --> 01:44:33.988]  Obviously Obama is a puppet, but Boehner says that he shouldn't be impeached.
[01:44:34.928 --> 01:44:42.355]  I understand, as Ron Paul says on this show just a few weeks ago, all of them should be impeached who have been voting for this NSA and who know what's going on.
[01:44:42.675 --> 01:44:47.479]  Congress likes to pass the buck on to the President, but Obama more and more is acting like a dictator.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:53.161]  Doesn't it send the right message to start impeachment of Obama on the NSA front?
[01:44:53.941 --> 01:44:55.862]  And then let's go and impeach Boehner as well.
[01:44:56.262 --> 01:45:03.363]  Shouldn't we see a constitutional, legal, lawful purge of all of the Stasi people in our government?
[01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:05.084]  Yes, I believe we should.
[01:45:05.144 --> 01:45:14.186]  And one of the ways to do it, and we can do it without Washington being involved at all, and that's to have under Article 5 of our Constitution, is to have a state's constitutional convention.
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:41.272]  And we can write in changes to the Constitution and ratify them at the same time, since it's the states doing it, where we could have a special prosecutor appointed by the states and the people and give them the backing of the state police, the local police, as well as the National Guards and all the states, so that they have the backing of the power of the states to appoint prosecutors to go after everyone in D.C.
[01:45:42.537 --> 01:45:52.566]  Well, I've always been against a con-con because they could hijack it, but now the bureaucracy's operating as an autocratic, technocratic system publicly.
[01:45:52.606 --> 01:45:53.306]  They brag about it.
[01:45:53.707 --> 01:45:55.588]  So, what does it matter?
[01:45:56.449 --> 01:45:57.069]  I agree with you.
[01:45:57.130 --> 01:45:58.130]  I think the salvation
[01:45:59.139 --> 01:46:03.241]  Lies with the states, because that's where the people reside.
[01:46:03.261 --> 01:46:10.345]  William Binney, top NSA whistleblower, is graciously giving us his time today to try to promote basic freedom.
[01:46:10.385 --> 01:46:15.808]  Exposedfacts.org is the website where you can see his work and other whistleblowers' work.
[01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:23.433]  I want to go to some phone calls here in a moment, but I wanted to ask you, because listeners are tweeting and asking about encryption.
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:28.524]  They're asking about different forms of encryption and does it work?
[01:46:28.944 --> 01:46:41.095]  I'm no encryption expert and no codebreaker like you, but from what's been mainline news, almost all major encryption, it turns out, was set up by NSA moles to have backdoors into it.
[01:46:41.476 --> 01:46:44.839]  And I think we should protest and remove the spying itself.
[01:46:46.455 --> 01:47:03.719]  Yes, FBI looks at it by saying if you encrypt what you're saying to one another, that means you're hiding something, therefore you're guilty of something, therefore we're going to target you.
[01:47:04.339 --> 01:47:06.240]  That's basically their approach.
[01:47:07.376 --> 01:47:14.780]  You just made the statement about encryption being under the program Bull Run, which is what NSA is doing.
[01:47:14.821 --> 01:47:26.467]  It's weakening encryptions or getting black back doors in for FBI or anybody else in the intelligence community to get into them, but they have weaknesses in the systems so that in many cases they have the ability to read them.
[01:47:26.547 --> 01:47:32.351]  And that means that none of the existing publicly available encryption systems are necessarily secure.
[01:47:33.035 --> 01:47:38.261]  So you can't really, I mean, Tor, I think, is one way of helping to add a complication to it.
[01:47:38.361 --> 01:47:45.649]  Tor is a kind of an anonymizing program that allows you to send your packets of email around different ways.
[01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:48.352]  So it gets, it hides who you are in the network.
[01:47:48.372 --> 01:47:48.612]  Sure.
[01:47:49.693 --> 01:47:50.033]  Sure.
[01:47:50.073 --> 01:47:50.273]  Sure.
[01:48:12.539 --> 01:48:25.207]  Even if you encrypt something successfully and you can defeat their attacks at the crypt system, once you decrypt something and put it on your computer, they can come in actively and attack your computer and take it off after you've decrypted it.
[01:48:25.227 --> 01:48:28.769]  Well sure, and of course I was told about this years ago, but it came out last year.
[01:48:28.789 --> 01:48:38.515]  The new chips come out that can be energized, even if your computer is walled off and on on the internet, and they can energize the chips wirelessly and suck the data off that way.
[01:48:40.697 --> 01:48:44.742]  William Benny, top NSA whistleblower, is our guest.
[01:48:44.762 --> 01:48:45.803]  We're moving quickly here.
[01:48:46.084 --> 01:48:47.345]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[01:48:47.786 --> 01:48:49.688]  George in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[01:48:49.748 --> 01:48:50.309]  Quick question.
[01:48:51.261 --> 01:49:02.543]  Quick question, I have been victimized by this stuff, anonymous calls, you can't trace, death threats, all sorts of stuff from government officials when you start to step on high toes.
[01:49:02.583 --> 01:49:11.125]  But my question is, they basically run everything out to the nth degree so that you can't, they run it past the statute of limitations so you can't do anything.
[01:49:11.405 --> 01:49:16.806]  So when you have enough information, you have enough details, you have enough witnesses, they basically are scot-free.
[01:49:16.826 --> 01:49:20.047]  We've got to find a way to say, look, if they're doing this through the government
[01:49:20.507 --> 01:49:21.468]  We're good.
[01:49:34.329 --> 01:49:37.771]  Yeah, I think the statute of limitations, though, is on the filing.
[01:49:38.111 --> 01:49:44.595]  That is, if you file a suit or a legal action against something, you have a certain amount of time to do that.
[01:49:44.615 --> 01:49:47.837]  But once you've filed, then you've met that limitation.
[01:49:48.078 --> 01:49:48.738]  Sure.
[01:49:48.778 --> 01:49:49.739]  That's one way of doing it.
[01:49:50.439 --> 01:49:52.260]  But I know exactly what you're saying.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:50:01.326]  They try to drag things out as long as possible, hoping that you'll get exhausted or you'll exhaust your resources and can't continue and have to drop it.
[01:50:01.466 --> 01:50:03.067]  And that's the kind of hope they have.
[01:50:03.547 --> 01:50:06.551]  And that's the kind of power they've got all the time and money in the world.
[01:50:06.591 --> 01:50:08.993]  I mean, after all, if they need more money, they'll tax you some more.
[01:50:09.754 --> 01:50:10.575]  Total tyranny.
[01:50:10.795 --> 01:50:11.737]  Scientific tyranny.
[01:50:11.757 --> 01:50:12.437]  George, thank you.
[01:50:12.998 --> 01:50:15.060]  Mr. Benny, you've been very gracious with the time.
[01:50:15.421 --> 01:50:16.462]  We've got a break coming up.
[01:50:16.482 --> 01:50:17.703]  If you've got to go, I understand.
[01:50:17.763 --> 01:50:20.607]  Or can you go another ten minutes to the end of the hour?
[01:50:22.473 --> 01:50:27.777]  Thank you, you're very nice, because I want to come back and jam in a call from Rob, Wes, George, and Brian.
[01:50:28.097 --> 01:50:31.379]  But quick questions, folks, so he can answer those.
[01:50:31.999 --> 01:50:38.263]  Mr. Benny, is that website I was giving out earlier, exposefacts.org, is that the best place for people to visit?
[01:50:39.164 --> 01:50:45.168]  Or else, whistleblower.org, or you can look at the Government Accountability Project, GAAP.
[01:50:45.868 --> 01:50:48.950]  You can Google GAAP and see all their websites and go in there.
[01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:51.512]  There's a lot of documentation in there, too.
[01:50:52.133 --> 01:50:55.418]  Well, the good news is, thanks to you and others, we now know about all this.
[01:50:56.079 --> 01:51:02.988]  Instead of them lying, saying, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, you're mentally ill, none of that exists, as you said, using, again, the Soviet tactic.
[01:51:03.389 --> 01:51:08.095]  And you fought them for 30 years, confirming these are Soviet tactics we're witnessing.
[01:51:09.488 --> 01:51:12.389]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:24.441]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:52:24.501 --> 01:52:28.204]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:52:28.264 --> 01:52:30.887]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[01:52:47.142 --> 01:52:47.382]  Thank you.
[01:53:07.523 --> 01:53:11.284]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[01:53:11.484 --> 01:53:14.265]  I'm sure you know, this economy sucks!
[01:53:14.725 --> 01:53:20.367]  We all realize that the American economy is tremendously unstable right now and will likely get much worse.
[01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:29.510]  There's monumental debt, government bailouts, stock and real estate bubbles that are primed to pop at any moment, which can flush away most or all of your retirement savings.
[01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:32.412]  This type of movement has enormous consequences.
[01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:37.756]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[01:53:38.097 --> 01:53:40.719]  Financial trouble is right here at our doorstep.
[01:53:40.959 --> 01:53:46.643]  But if you move right now and develop a backup plan immediately, this could be the most profitable time of your life.
[01:53:47.064 --> 01:53:52.328]  Proportionally, more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in our history.

[01:53:56.751 --> 01:53:58.632]  And prepare to profit as history repeats itself.
[01:54:17.785 --> 01:54:21.309]  We got a real American hero, William Benning, on the line with us.
[01:54:21.789 --> 01:54:25.192]  I don't really admire football players or movie stars, and I've gotten to know a lot of them.
[01:54:26.253 --> 01:54:32.299]  But I admire people that have courage and have honor and who've tried to protect this country, and who fought the Soviets, who were a true evil.
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:36.603]  And here he is telling you, after running a major division of the NSA.
[01:54:37.645 --> 01:54:42.451]  That we are mimicking the Soviet model or the Eastern German model.
[01:54:43.332 --> 01:54:50.482]  Mr. Binning, I want to get to a few more tweets and a few more calls here, and the six minutes we've got are five minutes now, but what's the bottom line here?
[01:54:52.565 --> 01:54:55.346]  I would kind of express the bottom line this way.
[01:54:55.386 --> 01:55:01.988]  I know we've been very comfortable in this country and expect our government to abide by the rules and the law and everything.
[01:55:02.008 --> 01:55:08.550]  That's because we haven't had a dictator in this country since George III about 240 years ago.
[01:55:09.130 --> 01:55:10.611]  So we've been coming over time.
[01:55:10.651 --> 01:55:15.272]  We don't have that living memory or the experience of having a totalitarian state.
[01:55:15.928 --> 01:55:26.615]  Not like the Germans do, and that's why the Germans are so upset, because they have living memory of the Stasi and some of the SS and KGB, and they know what this is all about.
[01:55:27.116 --> 01:55:34.501]  And so with that background, we in the United States become more trusting of the federal government, and they don't deserve it.
[01:55:35.121 --> 01:55:37.383]  And we need to stand up and speak up against this.
[01:55:37.503 --> 01:55:38.063]  That's the whole point.
[01:55:39.349 --> 01:55:44.891]  And for those that don't know, every time you get one of these Panopticon systems in, it only gets worse.
[01:55:45.251 --> 01:55:46.412]  The country devolves.
[01:55:46.892 --> 01:55:52.134]  So that's why the Germans are literally freaking out, because they know, folks, this thing rots.
[01:55:52.574 --> 01:55:54.515]  This doesn't get better unless you remove it.
[01:55:54.875 --> 01:55:56.356]  We have cancer, politically.
[01:55:57.096 --> 01:55:59.457]  Let's talk to Rob in Oregon real quick.
[01:55:59.517 --> 01:56:01.238]  Rob, go ahead with a question for William Binney.
[01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:03.263]  Thanks Alex.
[01:56:03.283 --> 01:56:05.885]  Mr. Binning, thanks a million for your sacrifices.
[01:56:05.965 --> 01:56:06.645]  Quick question.
[01:56:07.046 --> 01:56:10.989]  How active and intrusive is Canada in spying on their citizens?
[01:56:12.843 --> 01:56:32.339]  Well, Canada is a part of the Five Eyes, and I'm not clear on what extent they're involved with currently, although I believe they have access to things through a program that was published here not too long ago, X-Keyscore, which is like an interrogation routine that any of the Five Eyes, I believe, can use.
[01:56:32.479 --> 01:56:33.400]  They all swap data!
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:36.182]  Going into this bulk acquired data, yeah.
[01:56:36.829 --> 01:56:38.670]  So I think they're involved in that way.
[01:56:39.130 --> 01:56:41.932]  To what extent they participate in, you know, cross-spying.
[01:56:41.972 --> 01:56:42.953]  Like, they look at U.S.
[01:56:42.993 --> 01:56:44.073]  people, we look at theirs.
[01:56:44.173 --> 01:56:44.574]  I don't know.
[01:56:44.594 --> 01:56:47.755]  I don't know what that is or what that relationship is.
[01:56:47.955 --> 01:56:53.439]  I think they're working together in a common database and a common analytic attack of that database.
[01:56:54.847 --> 01:56:55.687]  Thank you so much, Rob.
[01:56:55.707 --> 01:56:56.288]  Great question.
[01:56:56.828 --> 01:57:01.290]  It's amazing having such an expert mind on encryption here with us and how this works.
[01:57:02.051 --> 01:57:08.174]  Another question, does Mr. Binney know about the intelligence agencies using their capabilities to manipulate the stock markets?
[01:57:08.694 --> 01:57:13.136]  That's from one of our listeners on Real Alex Jones, Mike's Headroom.
[01:57:14.857 --> 01:57:20.200]  Well, I really don't know anything about that, although it's not impossible that they couldn't be using that.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:23.382]  I mean, that data is available for industrial espionage as well.
[01:57:25.267 --> 01:57:28.149]  You know, that's the problem with this bulk acquisition of data like this.
[01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:29.610]  It makes everything possible.
[01:57:30.031 --> 01:57:31.732]  The question is, are they really doing it?
[01:57:31.852 --> 01:57:33.513]  And I don't really know for sure.
[01:57:33.734 --> 01:57:35.015]  It's a universe of data.
[01:57:35.435 --> 01:57:40.039]  What about the issue of planting DNA, planting fingerprints?
[01:57:40.059 --> 01:57:41.540]  We know that's gone on for a long time.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:42.881]  The media acts like they're 100%.
[01:57:43.581 --> 01:57:49.026]  What about all the governmental and corporate planting of evidence on people's computers using this system?
[01:57:50.610 --> 01:57:52.752]  Well, I mean, that's certainly possible.
[01:57:52.792 --> 01:57:57.276]  I mean, it's not a, you know, they can break into your computer and do just about anything they want to with it.
[01:57:58.577 --> 01:58:13.970]  Or, for example, as one of the slides that was published recently, I think in a newspaper in the Netherlands, showed that the worldwide assets for collection, and in there was a line that said, greater than 50,000 implants in the worldwide network.
[01:58:14.935 --> 01:58:25.645]  Now what that means is that's either hardware or software implanted in switches or servers or computers in the worldwide network, which means they basically control those devices.
[01:58:26.586 --> 01:58:29.609]  And they can have them and instruct them to do virtually anything they want to do.
[01:58:30.529 --> 01:58:30.909]  Incredible.
[01:58:30.929 --> 01:58:34.490]  They're not just sending it through a system, a net, that grabs it all.
[01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:38.691]  It's actually a control arm, just like the EAS systems to control communications.
[01:58:39.031 --> 01:58:41.392]  It's a total technocratic system.
[01:58:42.072 --> 01:58:44.532]  William Binney, thank you so much, sir, for the time.
[01:58:44.572 --> 01:58:45.893]  Look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[01:58:46.393 --> 01:58:47.193]  Okay, thank you.
[01:58:47.493 --> 01:58:48.093]  Amazing.
[01:58:48.413 --> 01:58:48.913]  Thank you, sir.
[01:58:48.933 --> 01:58:49.693]  Thank you for your courage.
[01:58:49.974 --> 01:58:50.494]  What a hero.
[01:58:50.514 --> 01:58:51.574]  We'll be back with a third hour.
[01:58:51.834 --> 01:58:52.514]  Your phone calls.
[01:58:52.534 --> 01:58:52.954]  Stay with us.
[01:58:52.994 --> 01:58:55.935]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:35.931]  This is not a low-grade formula.

[01:59:43.493 --> 01:59:47.255]  Using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[01:59:47.335 --> 01:59:48.915]  For your preparedness storage.
[01:59:49.056 --> 01:59:50.056]  For your home kitchen.

[02:00:02.281 --> 02:00:04.242]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.683 --> 02:00:07.404]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:19.433]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.113 --> 02:00:20.914]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.694 --> 02:00:22.575]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.235 --> 02:00:26.857]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.438 --> 02:00:31.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.274 --> 02:00:42.455]  I'm going to finish up with these NSA callers.
[02:00:42.515 --> 02:00:45.396]  Sorry we didn't get a chance to talk to William Benning, but we ran out of time.
[02:00:45.416 --> 02:00:48.416]  And then we're going to get the callers back on.
[02:00:48.436 --> 02:00:54.438]  Open the phones back up, who wanted to talk about to impeach or not to impeach.
[02:00:54.898 --> 02:01:07.602]  You just heard William Benning, who headed up one of the four divisions of the NSA, he was technically number four in the NSA, saying, we have the intelligence agencies running and controlling the government.
[02:01:08.652 --> 02:01:18.674]  And those intelligence agencies are all run by skull and bones, Harvard, Yale, Oxford, Princeton systems.
[02:01:19.495 --> 02:01:20.975]  And they're globalist eugenicists.
[02:01:21.035 --> 02:01:22.415]  And I'm going to explain this to everybody again.
[02:01:23.255 --> 02:01:33.438]  My father was top of his class, and then they tested 150 or something, I forget, Texans, and then he was in the top six or so.
[02:01:34.378 --> 02:01:37.599]  When he was in high school, and he was brought into UT,
[02:01:39.045 --> 02:01:43.508]  And they brought him in and basically said, this is a secret eugenics program.
[02:01:43.548 --> 02:01:46.210]  You're going to be part of the ruling class, whole nine yards.
[02:01:47.912 --> 02:01:54.817]  And my dad never even really told me that till I was making Endgame and my mother was watching it at the office and said, I don't believe this.
[02:01:55.297 --> 02:01:58.920]  And then suddenly my dad just spilt his guts because he was never part of it.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.243]  Growing up, we had all the Brzezinski books and everything around the house.
[02:02:02.803 --> 02:02:04.544]  I just knew all this by osmosis.
[02:02:04.965 --> 02:02:06.426]  He would tell me how the world really ran.
[02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:15.997]  But it's not that my dad, out of 200 million people back in 1965, was Superman or something.
[02:02:16.377 --> 02:02:18.819]  It was they were scooping everybody up.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:24.224]  And I've had experts from Congress, you name it, from the Frank Church Committee on to break this down.
[02:02:24.964 --> 02:02:30.809]  Since the 30s, they've been scooping up, mainly British intelligence, all of the smartest people.
[02:02:32.205 --> 02:02:37.148]  All of the people they can get a hold of and putting them in British front groups.
[02:02:37.368 --> 02:02:38.129]  And I want to be clear.
[02:02:38.829 --> 02:02:39.470]  I am Welsh.
[02:02:40.461 --> 02:02:46.044]  I probably have more English blood in me than any of the other Heinz 57 I am.
[02:02:46.064 --> 02:02:51.247]  A ton of German, Alsatian, French, Scotch, Irish, Native American.
[02:02:51.628 --> 02:02:52.328]  I mean, it's in there.
[02:02:52.928 --> 02:02:54.949]  So I'm not bashing the British people.
[02:02:55.470 --> 02:02:58.031]  It's the model developed by British intelligence.
[02:02:58.792 --> 02:03:00.533]  And they set up the first NSA.
[02:03:00.933 --> 02:03:03.875]  The Nazis were so naive, they didn't think the British could listen to every phone call.
[02:03:04.535 --> 02:03:09.158]  They were listening to every phone call of the Nazis and were able to roll them all up and beat them very quickly.
[02:03:09.909 --> 02:03:11.790]  People go, well, see, spying's good.
[02:03:12.850 --> 02:03:14.911]  British intelligence put Hitler in charge.
[02:03:15.752 --> 02:03:16.672]  That's declassified.
[02:03:17.012 --> 02:03:18.153]  They didn't run Hitler.
[02:03:18.593 --> 02:03:20.014]  They funded him.
[02:03:20.334 --> 02:03:26.237]  David Rockefeller's granddad, John D. Rockefeller, funded Hitler.
[02:03:26.297 --> 02:03:27.998]  I mean, that's in Pulitzer Prize winning books.
[02:03:29.078 --> 02:03:30.279]  I mean, think of the evil.
[02:03:31.414 --> 02:03:38.135]  To create Hitler so you can set up a police state to counter him, to sell free people on being slaves.
[02:03:38.915 --> 02:03:43.176]  Create Al Qaeda, protect them, let them attack you, so you can set up a police state.
[02:03:43.876 --> 02:03:44.936]  See, it's the same deal.
[02:03:44.976 --> 02:03:46.937]  And I know it's simple for our listeners to understand.
[02:03:47.297 --> 02:03:53.898]  The general public still goes, why would Obama want to shut down power plants and increase the prices?
[02:03:56.399 --> 02:03:57.419]  I mean, he wants money.
[02:03:59.199 --> 02:03:59.579]  No!
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:01.740]  They control the printing of the money.
[02:04:02.141 --> 02:04:06.002]  They want to only let General Electric and two other companies have power plants.
[02:04:06.303 --> 02:04:07.363]  That makes them more money.
[02:04:07.663 --> 02:04:09.204]  But it's about consolidating power.
[02:04:09.484 --> 02:04:11.885]  It's about control.
[02:04:12.246 --> 02:04:13.746]  Control.
[02:04:14.106 --> 02:04:16.668]  Control over free will.
[02:04:18.008 --> 02:04:22.571]  And if you control the energy, from like a children's TV show from the 80s,
[02:04:25.052 --> 02:04:27.654]  I will get the Energon Cubes, Megatron!
[02:04:28.295 --> 02:04:30.177]  What do the Decepticons want?
[02:04:30.197 --> 02:04:31.218]  They want energy.
[02:04:31.738 --> 02:04:33.380]  They want control of the energy.
[02:04:34.468 --> 02:04:39.231]  What's the number one equation for human life, or plant life, or any life?
[02:04:39.412 --> 02:04:40.032]  Energy.
[02:04:40.853 --> 02:04:41.313]  Energy.
[02:04:42.073 --> 02:04:46.637]  And that's why I keep going back to this power plants being shut off, or the borders being wide open.
[02:04:46.917 --> 02:04:51.140]  They want to destroy our free will and our capacity to live.
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:57.544]  We're going to come back and take your phone calls from Wes, George, Jared, Mike,
[02:04:58.650 --> 02:04:59.871]  Fred and many others.
[02:04:59.891 --> 02:05:00.751]  800-259-9231.
[02:05:00.771 --> 02:05:03.813]  When you get a chance, call in.
[02:05:03.833 --> 02:05:05.734]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:05.754 --> 02:05:08.016]  Stay with us.
[02:05:09.997 --> 02:05:12.579]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[02:05:12.779 --> 02:05:17.702]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[02:05:17.762 --> 02:05:20.023]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[02:05:24.926 --> 02:05:25.186]  I'm good.
[02:05:45.137 --> 02:05:52.403]  Five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[02:05:52.683 --> 02:05:56.226]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[02:05:56.567 --> 02:06:02.812]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[02:06:03.192 --> 02:06:08.277]  Moe Enlabe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[02:06:09.895 --> 02:06:13.639]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:06:13.739 --> 02:06:14.900]  I taste dirt in it.
[02:06:14.980 --> 02:06:16.061]  God knows what's in this.
[02:06:16.301 --> 02:06:20.385]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:06:20.525 --> 02:06:26.330]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:27.471]  That one is better.
[02:06:27.511 --> 02:06:28.492]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:06:28.772 --> 02:06:30.173]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:06:30.213 --> 02:06:30.714]  It's good water.
[02:06:30.834 --> 02:06:36.558]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:06:36.798 --> 02:06:43.864]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[02:06:44.044 --> 02:06:46.526]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water.
[02:06:46.746 --> 02:06:54.691]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:06:54.812 --> 02:06:55.832]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:06:55.852 --> 02:06:56.833]  It's good water.
[02:06:57.033 --> 02:06:57.494]  Refreshing?
[02:06:57.634 --> 02:06:57.954]  It's good!
[02:06:58.134 --> 02:07:03.698]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:03.738 --> 02:07:08.301]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:25.133]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:25.533 --> 02:07:28.135]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:28.455 --> 02:07:33.639]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:33.919 --> 02:07:40.784]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:07:41.284 --> 02:07:45.046]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:07:45.427 --> 02:07:50.210]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:58.953]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:07:59.133 --> 02:08:03.195]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:08:03.395 --> 02:08:08.837]  Take advantage of this unprecedented, 30% off, Super Detox Special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:08.877 --> 02:08:16.619]  Is this new?
[02:08:17.279 --> 02:08:18.500]  It's so good, there's no people.
[02:08:19.867 --> 02:08:30.130]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:08:30.150 --> 02:08:33.592]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[02:08:38.620 --> 02:08:41.622]  It's a military mission in North St.
[02:08:41.662 --> 02:08:42.043]  Louis.
[02:08:42.323 --> 02:08:49.369]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[02:08:49.529 --> 02:08:54.053]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[02:08:54.333 --> 02:08:55.194]  Guns will be taken.
[02:08:55.234 --> 02:08:56.435]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:08:56.715 --> 02:08:57.696]  We will take all weapons.
[02:08:57.896 --> 02:09:00.217]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[02:09:00.277 --> 02:09:04.640]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:05.140]  Enough.
[02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:05.980]  Enough.
[02:09:06.501 --> 02:09:06.781]  Enough.
[02:09:07.561 --> 02:09:07.801]  Enough.
[02:09:07.941 --> 02:09:12.404]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:09:12.504 --> 02:09:16.446]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:09:16.866 --> 02:09:23.011]  NSKS Late News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[02:09:23.711 --> 02:09:23.851]  Us.
[02:09:24.031 --> 02:09:31.937]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:09:32.057 --> 02:09:34.659]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:37.241]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:09:38.101 --> 02:09:44.087]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:09:44.387 --> 02:09:49.032]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[02:09:49.352 --> 02:09:54.017]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[02:10:01.778 --> 02:10:06.764]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[02:10:06.784 --> 02:10:08.567]  You're in your apartment!
[02:10:08.587 --> 02:10:09.568]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[02:10:09.588 --> 02:10:10.649]  Go back inside right now!
[02:10:10.789 --> 02:10:11.550]  I am inside.
[02:10:11.791 --> 02:10:12.872]  I have two words for you.
[02:10:13.713 --> 02:10:14.554]  Predator Globes.
[02:10:15.535 --> 02:10:16.537]  You will never see it coming.
[02:10:20.569 --> 02:10:23.031]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[02:10:23.431 --> 02:10:32.597]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:10:32.677 --> 02:10:37.940]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:42.923]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[02:10:43.203 --> 02:10:45.245]  If you want them, come and take them!
[02:10:47.034 --> 02:10:48.355]  We are on the march.
[02:10:48.715 --> 02:10:51.256]  The empire is on the run.
[02:10:51.557 --> 02:10:57.880]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:13.989]  There is no doubt that we have a high-tech tyranny run by illegitimate foreign banks that has converted local and state police basically into federal arms of that globalist conspiracy against free humanity.
[02:11:15.413 --> 02:11:19.636]  And Eisenhower warned us of that, and we are now sitting face-to-face with it.
[02:11:20.076 --> 02:11:21.557]  And it's not staying stagnant.
[02:11:21.637 --> 02:11:30.582]  It is growing exponentially, and it will destroy the way of life, the prosperity, and the freedom of basically everyone in this nation.
[02:11:31.223 --> 02:11:33.744]  Even if you play along that you're part of the system, you're not.
[02:11:34.565 --> 02:11:44.591]  William Binney, number four at the National Security Agency, there over 30 years, known as one of the greatest living cryptographers and codebreakers out there.
[02:11:45.353 --> 02:12:07.857]  Who fought the Stasi, the NKVD, and the KGB for 30 years, plus says the whole thing's turned in for industrial espionage and the takeover of America, and that the intelligence agencies run the government, and have corrupted the whole government, and are blackmailing the whole government.
[02:12:08.996 --> 02:12:14.599]  And he witnessed it and quit, but he can't tell us because of quote, national security laws, what he knows.
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:17.020]  He'd have to get run to another country.
[02:12:18.261 --> 02:12:20.222]  And he sure ain't gonna run to Russia, they don't like him.
[02:12:24.124 --> 02:12:34.570]  And that's why I was at Barton Springs last fall, on a warm sunny day, while my children were in front of me swimming.
[02:12:38.553 --> 02:12:41.816]  And I was listening to three men and three women.
[02:12:42.736 --> 02:12:44.378]  They all look like they're about 30 years old, 32, 33.
[02:12:45.238 --> 02:12:49.902]  They were all leaving, being police officers locally.
[02:12:49.922 --> 02:12:52.404]  They didn't even say Austin, they were just cops.
[02:12:53.124 --> 02:13:00.290]  Back and finished college, and were all going to work at the NSA in San Antonio.
[02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:03.873]  They built a giant center there in the last few years, and one in Utah.
[02:13:06.027 --> 02:13:14.594]  And they were arrogantly laying around in the sun like they had announced they just won the Indy 500 and that they were, you know, Senna or something.
[02:13:14.614 --> 02:13:17.576]  That they just won Formula One World Championship.
[02:13:19.197 --> 02:13:20.258]  They were Mario Andretti.
[02:13:20.598 --> 02:13:21.019]  I mean, I mean...
[02:13:22.307 --> 02:13:30.810]  I've done some pretty amazing famous things and I don't lay around in the sun going, yeah, I'm not going to be a cop anymore, I'm going to go work at the NSA.
[02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:36.791]  Yeah, I just got accepted and said, oh great, I bet you see a lot of... And they were bragging about spying on people.
[02:13:38.152 --> 02:13:41.853]  And my kids were swimming and I went over and I said, get your stuff, get out in a few minutes, we're going to go.
[02:13:44.005 --> 02:13:46.347]  And I said, meet me over there on the other side, I'm gonna have your stuff.
[02:13:46.807 --> 02:13:48.288]  So I don't want him to be there when I did this.
[02:13:48.788 --> 02:13:50.929]  And I walked over very politely, but very seriously.
[02:13:50.949 --> 02:13:53.611]  And I said, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[02:13:54.972 --> 02:14:05.159]  You watch all these Hollywood movies where spies are all glorified and everything, and you think you're real super sexy, and their wives were all cops going to work for the data mining as well.
[02:14:05.339 --> 02:14:06.379]  They were all just bragging.
[02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:09.702]  The women all had their nails, and they were all shaking their butts.
[02:14:09.762 --> 02:14:12.964]  I mean, they were just getting off on it, like it was a status thing.
[02:14:13.703 --> 02:14:16.924]  I looked at them all, and I said, this country's going to fall.
[02:14:17.884 --> 02:14:19.885]  This stuff's being put in to bring the nation down.
[02:14:21.045 --> 02:14:22.826]  The pension funds, everything, are going to be taken.
[02:14:23.426 --> 02:14:24.647]  It's already being done in other countries.
[02:14:25.507 --> 02:14:34.310]  And I said, when it's all said and done, people like you, even if you don't get brought to justice, are going to know you ruined this country and you aided and abetted its destruction.
[02:14:35.330 --> 02:14:37.451]  And they look scared, and they should be.
[02:14:38.071 --> 02:14:41.552]  Not scared of me, because I'm there telling them that the judgment's coming!
[02:14:45.014 --> 02:14:45.914]  Made me want to vomit!
[02:14:47.835 --> 02:14:55.776]  It was a friend playing, Weldon was playing at the Driscoll Old Cattleman Hotel downtown a few months ago and he invited me down there.
[02:14:55.796 --> 02:14:57.876]  He and his wife did.
[02:14:57.896 --> 02:15:00.277]  So I went down there after work one night.
[02:15:00.297 --> 02:15:00.837]  I was working late.
[02:15:00.877 --> 02:15:02.157]  He was playing at 8 o'clock down there.
[02:15:03.817 --> 02:15:09.078]  I went over there to hear some of the country music and sitting next to us was a table.
[02:15:09.438 --> 02:15:10.219]  A lounge table.
[02:15:10.979 --> 02:15:12.319]  And I just looked at these people
[02:15:13.581 --> 02:15:16.982]  And I went, oh man, those are a bunch of private contractors or data miners.
[02:15:17.022 --> 02:15:20.883]  The haircuts, the way they were acting, you just learn what people look like and how they act.
[02:15:22.663 --> 02:15:29.064]  We were having a problem with a guy the other day and I said, that guy's probably like five, six tour combat vet, on drugs, out of his mind, don't mess with him.
[02:15:29.504 --> 02:15:30.685]  My buddy's like, how do you know that?
[02:15:31.025 --> 02:15:32.925]  He later checked and found out that was the case.
[02:15:33.265 --> 02:15:34.085]  He's like, how did you know that?
[02:15:34.125 --> 02:15:35.166]  Well, I just look at the guy.
[02:15:35.746 --> 02:15:36.966]  Okay, I've been doing this a while.
[02:15:39.667 --> 02:15:41.367]  I went and saw two guns.
[02:15:43.891 --> 02:15:47.577]  With Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg a few months ago, by myself.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.243]  And the whole theater probably only had 20 people in it?
[02:15:53.024 --> 02:16:13.940]  And I could look and tell it was all Marines, and DEA people, and CIA people, all in there to root for these movies that are made about them, mainlining that the CIA brings in the drugs and launders the money, and that there's good divisions of the Marines fighting them, and the Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi where they're shipping the drugs in, which they really do.
[02:16:15.421 --> 02:16:16.702]  I'm not going to get into how I know that.
[02:16:17.796 --> 02:16:21.940]  And when I walked out of the movie, I went, so you guys are Marines, right?
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:22.921]  And they go, yeah, how do you know?
[02:16:23.101 --> 02:16:26.444]  And I walk out, people are going to the bathroom, and I go, you guys are Army, aren't you?
[02:16:26.804 --> 02:16:28.045]  They go, how do you know that?
[02:16:28.646 --> 02:16:30.207]  And I just know Marines from Army.
[02:16:30.808 --> 02:16:32.849]  I know FBI from DEA.
[02:16:32.949 --> 02:16:37.854]  It's so brainwashed, folks, I can look at them and tell.
[02:16:44.212 --> 02:16:56.219]  And I'm just sitting there for like 30 minutes sunbathing while my kids are swimming, just listening to these cops brag about how they're graduating up to the NSA, and their wives are so excited, and oh, they're going to college to do it too.
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:58.240]  And I just wanted to throw up.
[02:17:00.061 --> 02:17:01.722]  I mean, these people are robbing me.
[02:17:01.802 --> 02:17:03.583]  They are spying on me illegally.
[02:17:03.924 --> 02:17:05.685]  They are using it to overthrow the Congress.
[02:17:06.265 --> 02:17:12.709]  They're going to have gun confiscation, FEMA camps, and these cops aren't even bad people.
[02:17:14.301 --> 02:17:15.402]  But they're still enemies.
[02:17:15.942 --> 02:17:17.523]  They're still illegal criminals.
[02:17:18.444 --> 02:17:20.265]  And I gotta be honest with you.
[02:17:20.346 --> 02:17:23.388]  You know, I physically felt very aggressive towards them.
[02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:34.496]  And I didn't bow up and stuff when I was talking to them, but I'm much more focused in person, and people, when I really get a hold of them, I mean, I looked them right in the eyes.
[02:17:34.836 --> 02:17:43.683]  At first, they started to laugh about it, and I was just like, you know it's evil, you know it's wrong, and you need to repent, basically.
[02:17:47.216 --> 02:17:50.277]  I mean, it isn't Jack Ryan's shadow recruit, okay?
[02:17:50.778 --> 02:17:52.218]  That isn't what's going on here.
[02:17:53.199 --> 02:17:58.801]  It's the CIA, it's these Boy Scouts that, oh, they go out and they're so nice to everyone.
[02:18:01.302 --> 02:18:05.204]  Oh, they have whole divisions of Boy Scouts that do the white hat work.
[02:18:05.864 --> 02:18:10.747]  And then the guys with the black hats sit around in the office next to them, laughing at you all day long.
[02:18:10.767 --> 02:18:13.668]  It's like when I had Frank Serpico on.
[02:18:15.271 --> 02:18:28.473]  I said, what percentage of the people in the NYPD narcotics division were dealing drugs and skimming off the hooker money and everything else?
[02:18:28.513 --> 02:18:28.793]  He said 100%.
[02:18:29.434 --> 02:18:38.395]  They shot him in the face, folks, and tried to kill him because he didn't want to be part of narcotics and prostitution.
[02:18:42.096 --> 02:18:42.576]  That was in the 60s.
[02:18:44.522 --> 02:18:45.743]  Again, I can't believe my job.
[02:18:45.783 --> 02:18:47.364]  I get to talk to Frank Serpico.
[02:18:47.704 --> 02:18:55.588]  I get to talk to William Binney, who's familiar with our work and follows it.
[02:18:56.089 --> 02:18:57.569]  I mean, what a responsibility!
[02:18:59.891 --> 02:19:01.031]  And I'm not tooting our horn.
[02:19:01.432 --> 02:19:05.414]  I'm saying you, the listeners, us together, we're part of something epic.
[02:19:07.302 --> 02:19:14.205]  Our AM and FM affiliates are so wonderful to be carrying this pro-liberty, pro-America information.
[02:19:15.706 --> 02:19:18.727]  This is the type of stuff in the 50s we used to beam into the Soviet Union.
[02:19:19.587 --> 02:19:21.248]  Back when our government wasn't pure evil.
[02:19:22.129 --> 02:19:31.893]  Back when Eisenhower warned of the paramilitary, military-industrial complex takeover that in the full speech he warns, run by a technological elite.
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:37.423]  Listen to the whole 22-minute speech, it's online, with film footage.
[02:19:39.664 --> 02:19:49.852]  Eisenhower was completely freaked out, because they just come to him with a plan for a dictatorship and nuclear war with the Soviets, with Kerdel Slimay and others, and L.L.
[02:19:49.892 --> 02:19:55.476]  Leibnizer and a plan to blow up shopping malls and shoot people in movie theaters for gun confiscation.
[02:19:56.497 --> 02:19:58.839]  And you know what Eisenhower did, is he fired a bunch of them.
[02:20:02.296 --> 02:20:04.244]  Because he had a conscience, not that he was perfect.
[02:20:05.529 --> 02:20:07.295]  We'll be right back with your phone calls, I promise.
[02:20:07.315 --> 02:20:07.717]  Stay with us.

[02:22:08.497 --> 02:22:13.280]  It seems that everywhere you turn to these days, people are talking about the health benefits of silver.
[02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:16.322]  But don't be fooled into believing all silver is the same.
[02:22:16.782 --> 02:22:22.646]  Only one silver solution has been clinically shown to be hundreds of times stronger than colloidal or ionic silver.
[02:22:22.926 --> 02:22:24.687]  That's supernatural silver.

[02:23:07.806 --> 02:23:09.788]  Think the national debt is $15 trillion?
[02:23:10.088 --> 02:23:20.859]  Boston U economics professor Lawrence Kotlikoff astutely points out that after factoring in guarantees such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and defense expenditures, the national debt is closer to $211 trillion.
[02:23:21.039 --> 02:23:23.902]  Mathematically, this debt is not serviceable via taxation.
[02:23:24.082 --> 02:23:27.045]  And for politicians on Capitol Hill, default is not an option.
[02:23:27.145 --> 02:23:33.010]  So we can expect the Federal Reserve to monetize the shortfall resulting in even more confiscation of our hard-earned savings via inflation.
[02:23:33.170 --> 02:23:35.512]  Hi, my name is Adam Miller with Midas Resources.
[02:23:35.692 --> 02:23:45.020]  In light of the MF Global swindle, it is now more apparent than ever that our savings investments are not secure in the hands of traditional banking institutions overseen by government technocrats kept in their back pockets.
[02:23:45.180 --> 02:23:48.181]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 ext.
[02:23:48.541 --> 02:23:54.984]  148 to find out how you can protect your savings from confiscation with liquid, portable, and private precious metals.
[02:23:55.284 --> 02:23:58.385]  I'll even send you a booklet titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold to serve as a guide.
[02:23:58.525 --> 02:23:59.326]  That number again is 800-686-2237 ext.
[02:23:59.346 --> 02:23:59.326]  148.
[02:23:59.366 --> 02:23:59.586]  800-686-2237 ext. 148.
[02:24:12.841 --> 02:24:14.762]  We're back live, going right to your phone calls.
[02:24:15.023 --> 02:24:16.384]  You just joined us last hour.
[02:24:17.264 --> 02:24:19.526]  That is a news-making, important interview.
[02:24:20.186 --> 02:24:27.511]  William Binney, former head of an entire division of the National Security Agency, the top whistleblower in probably U.S.
[02:24:27.551 --> 02:24:28.372]  intelligence history.
[02:24:29.753 --> 02:24:30.534]  Highest ranking.
[02:24:32.455 --> 02:24:40.360]  Quietly quit in 2001, in October, when they said, we're going to now switch all this on and spy on everything in real time.
[02:24:41.243 --> 02:24:42.664]  He said, that's it, I'm out of here.
[02:24:42.964 --> 02:24:45.605]  Went and testified to Congress for years, quietly, nothing was done.
[02:24:46.706 --> 02:24:49.767]  He said, look, the intelligence agencies run the government through blackmail.
[02:24:50.327 --> 02:24:51.268]  That's all I can tell you.
[02:24:52.809 --> 02:24:55.510]  And it's totally illegal, and it's a Soviet model.
[02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:58.411]  Well, I've reverse engineered the whole thing.
[02:24:59.552 --> 02:25:01.873]  Right down to the uniforms, it's a Soviet model.
[02:25:04.974 --> 02:25:05.795]  That's what we're facing.
[02:25:07.395 --> 02:25:10.437]  And they've built the FEMA camps, which are now declassified as well.
[02:25:12.188 --> 02:25:16.610]  Again, they have lawyers that go, we look for things called FEMA camps, they don't exist.
[02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:33.219]  There are Emergency Centers Establishment Act buildings, and there are Civilian Inmate Labor Camp program, and there is the Garden Plot and Cable Splicer and RECS 84, and the Civil Emergency Internment Plan, but we couldn't find any FEMA camp.
[02:25:36.448 --> 02:25:39.750]  It's like they go, there's no chemtrails.
[02:25:40.470 --> 02:25:47.533]  There is the High Altitude Geoengineering Global Weather Mod program run by the Department of Energy that's classified.
[02:25:49.174 --> 02:25:50.815]  But you didn't say the name right, Sonny.
[02:25:53.356 --> 02:25:54.116]  There is U.S.
[02:25:54.196 --> 02:26:09.982]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B, that says it's illegal to secretly test chemical, biological, or radiological on the public without their consent, unless it's for law enforcement or research purposes.
[02:26:11.982 --> 02:26:14.503]  They got a law passed saying they can kill you and your family.
[02:26:14.963 --> 02:26:19.865]  I say their law is a piece of garbage and is an indictment of their criminal activity.
[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:28.427]  Just because a serial killer writes himself a note that says he can grab little kids out of the backyard and go kill them, doesn't mean it's okay.
[02:26:29.829 --> 02:26:41.882]  Just because Al Qaeda says their God says kill every Christian they find in their new magazine ISIS puts out, that I was reading yesterday online, doesn't mean it makes it okay, because they say they got a note from God.
[02:26:43.063 --> 02:26:44.664]  There's a reason this stuff's illegal.
[02:26:45.384 --> 02:26:52.346]  Every two-bit dictatorship says they spy on people for their safety, but it's always used for domination and control.
[02:26:56.428 --> 02:27:03.230]  And all of those police officers about to become NSA minions, we're all aiding and abetting criminal activity.
[02:27:03.570 --> 02:27:08.232]  And just because they're slack-jawed and arrogant and dumb doesn't mean it's okay.
[02:27:09.755 --> 02:27:11.278]  Let's talk to Wes in Indiana.
[02:27:11.438 --> 02:27:12.300]  You're on the air, Wes.
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:12.981]  Thanks for calling.
[02:27:14.043 --> 02:27:15.626]  Hey, thanks Alex for having me on today.
[02:27:16.408 --> 02:27:18.051]  Basically, what I want to say is...
[02:27:19.016 --> 02:27:32.783]  I know I either heard from you or read somewhere that Mr. Binney was one of the primary programmers who had coded all these algorithms that the NSA is either now using or may not be using to this day.
[02:27:33.044 --> 02:27:44.910]  I'm wondering is there any way to circumvent these algorithms in order to effectively collaborate with other activists without fear of being eavesdropped on?
[02:27:44.930 --> 02:27:48.432]  Go ahead caller, I'm sorry.
[02:27:50.470 --> 02:28:03.580]  Basically, I had heard either from you or read about Mr. Binney that he had programmed some of these algorithms that the NSA uses to eavesdrop on American citizens and citizens abroad.
[02:28:04.421 --> 02:28:09.985]  I was wondering if there was any way to circumvent these algorithms.
[02:28:10.446 --> 02:28:11.907]  Well, he's not allowed to tell you that?
[02:28:13.527 --> 02:28:15.568]  But he was saying some of the systems that are better.
[02:28:16.669 --> 02:28:17.649]  He is one of the top.
[02:28:17.669 --> 02:28:18.410]  This guy's a genius.
[02:28:18.430 --> 02:28:19.470]  Probably has like a 200 IQ.
[02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:21.271]  By the way, I don't usually ignore callers.
[02:28:21.291 --> 02:28:22.191]  They were popping in my ear.
[02:28:22.592 --> 02:28:24.733]  Jesse Ventura is scheduled to be on next Thursday.
[02:28:25.253 --> 02:28:26.233]  I want to get him on now.
[02:28:27.014 --> 02:28:27.814]  Like tomorrow.
[02:28:28.014 --> 02:28:29.075]  So call Tyrell.
[02:28:29.095 --> 02:28:29.635]  He's the best way.
[02:28:29.695 --> 02:28:30.436]  I got his home number.
[02:28:30.456 --> 02:28:32.537]  I got his wife's cell phone, but I'm not going to call those.
[02:28:33.197 --> 02:28:35.598]  Just call Tyrell and say, hey, call in the favor.
[02:28:36.219 --> 02:28:40.161]  I'm sure Jesse will be on TV tonight, but I want to get him on here tomorrow.
[02:28:40.661 --> 02:28:41.262]  ASAP.
[02:28:41.522 --> 02:28:42.743]  Call Tyrell for me right now.
[02:28:43.283 --> 02:28:43.483]  Okay?
[02:28:43.503 --> 02:28:46.025]  Because they say they'll do me favors for me, and I've done a lot for them.
[02:28:46.045 --> 02:28:47.826]  I want to get Jesse on ASAP.
[02:28:49.186 --> 02:28:55.170]  AP reports they've just awarded $1.8 million in Jesse Ventura's defamation suit.
[02:28:55.730 --> 02:28:56.251]  There it is.
[02:28:56.331 --> 02:28:58.272]  Verdict reaching Ventura defamation suit.
[02:28:59.306 --> 02:28:59.526]  St.
[02:28:59.586 --> 02:29:07.674]  Paul, Minnesota, the attorney for American sniper author Chris Kyle's state announced today a verdict has been reached in Jesse Ventura's information lawsuit.
[02:29:08.895 --> 02:29:11.337]  I will preface this and it goes on again.
[02:29:11.578 --> 02:29:14.280]  Where's the part the guys were telling me in my ear about the 1.8 million?
[02:29:14.721 --> 02:29:17.623]  I want to get the AP one because that's one put out basically by their lawyer.
[02:29:17.984 --> 02:29:20.186]  But I'll read it during the break and come back and give you more details.
[02:29:21.534 --> 02:29:30.276]  On Monday, the jury deliberating the Jesse Ventura defamation lawsuit informed Judge Richard Kahl that they were deadlocked and didn't expect that it would change.
[02:29:30.736 --> 02:29:36.837]  He told them in a firm but friendly gathering to go back in and give it one more shot.
[02:29:37.577 --> 02:29:39.818]  When we come back, I'll give you the verdict.
[02:29:39.858 --> 02:29:40.858]  They were telling me that in my ear.
[02:29:40.878 --> 02:29:43.999]  We'll double check that coming up right now.
[02:29:44.039 --> 02:29:44.419]  There it is.
[02:29:44.799 --> 02:29:48.940]  Headline, Houston Chronicle, Jury Awards, Ventura, $1.8 million in defamation case.
[02:29:50.103 --> 02:29:51.183]  And I guess this is just breaking.
[02:29:51.203 --> 02:29:52.864]  They're telling me that, but maybe it's been out longer.
[02:29:53.564 --> 02:29:54.205]  It just broke.
[02:29:54.245 --> 02:29:55.565]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[02:29:56.385 --> 02:29:57.446]  And, uh, stay with us.
[02:29:58.566 --> 02:29:59.447]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.947 --> 02:30:01.547]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.468 --> 02:30:05.169]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.255 --> 02:30:11.156]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:30:11.476 --> 02:30:19.400]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:30:19.521 --> 02:30:26.604]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:30:27.065 --> 02:30:31.327]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:30:31.667 --> 02:30:41.831]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:30:42.292 --> 02:30:48.474]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:30:48.774 --> 02:30:51.035]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:30:51.335 --> 02:30:54.997]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[02:30:55.157 --> 02:30:56.759]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[02:30:57.119 --> 02:31:01.044]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[02:31:01.284 --> 02:31:08.212]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[02:31:09.755 --> 02:31:11.536]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[02:31:12.057 --> 02:31:19.021]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:31:19.481 --> 02:31:29.888]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:39.555]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:31:40.275 --> 02:31:43.696]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:31:44.337 --> 02:31:47.778]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:31:48.098 --> 02:31:49.698]  Experience the new formula.
[02:31:50.158 --> 02:31:52.139]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:31:52.739 --> 02:31:53.740]  Shield your family.
[02:31:54.060 --> 02:31:55.460]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:31:55.880 --> 02:31:58.481]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:59.041 --> 02:32:03.003]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:08.257 --> 02:32:08.477]  I didn't.
[02:32:08.557 --> 02:32:09.438]  I taste dirt in it.
[02:32:09.518 --> 02:32:10.579]  God knows what's in this.
[02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:14.944]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:32:15.124 --> 02:32:21.010]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:32:21.150 --> 02:32:22.151]  That one is better.
[02:32:22.231 --> 02:32:23.212]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:32:23.492 --> 02:32:24.854]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:32:25.094 --> 02:32:25.454]  Good water.
[02:32:25.554 --> 02:32:31.375]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:32:31.615 --> 02:32:38.737]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:32:38.957 --> 02:32:41.437]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:32:41.658 --> 02:32:49.659]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:32:49.859 --> 02:32:51.140]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:32:51.180 --> 02:32:51.900]  It's good water.
[02:32:52.100 --> 02:32:52.540]  Refreshing.
[02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:53.000]  It's good!
[02:32:53.320 --> 02:33:01.124]  Go to infowarsstore.com today and get your free wire stand with the purchase of a Pro-Pure Big Water Filtration System.
[02:33:01.444 --> 02:33:01.865]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:01.885 --> 02:33:01.865]  66.
[02:33:02.025 --> 02:33:03.265]  Answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:03.546 --> 02:33:05.166]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.827 --> 02:33:32.668]  Yeah, sorry to that last caller while he was asking a really important question.
[02:33:32.688 --> 02:33:34.689]  I was learning about Jesse Ventura.
[02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:44.694]  I just called Ventura's people and they said he's on a two-day golf trip and it's told him he refuses to do any interviews regardless if the jury came back.
[02:33:45.815 --> 02:33:47.336]  He's obsessed with golf and surfing.
[02:33:48.256 --> 02:33:51.398]  But that they said they would call him for me and see if he can come on tomorrow.
[02:33:52.645 --> 02:33:53.305]  I'm sure he will.
[02:33:53.585 --> 02:33:55.306]  He was scheduled, actually, next Wednesday.
[02:33:55.926 --> 02:34:02.209]  But, you know, I'm sad for the wife of Chris Kyle, but I'm also glad for Jesse Ventura.
[02:34:03.149 --> 02:34:09.731]  Because Jesse Ventura did not ever say he was glad that Navy SEALs died, and he was not knocked out.
[02:34:10.171 --> 02:34:19.075]  He was there for a commencement speech, on record, at a bar owned by one of the most famous Navy SEAL trainers.
[02:34:20.194 --> 02:34:25.235]  And he has them all as witnesses that no confrontation happened, nothing went on.
[02:34:25.975 --> 02:34:39.759]  And Chris Kyle was clearly hired in a black-op disinformation campaign, for best I know, to lie and defame Jesse Ventura so he can't run for president down the road, regardless what you think about it.
[02:34:41.339 --> 02:34:45.000]  And to try to throw him out of the Navy SEAL underwater demolition team
[02:34:46.621 --> 02:34:47.962]  This is how you defame people.
[02:35:18.507 --> 02:35:21.328]  And I was the one that told Jesse Ventura when he was in Mexico.
[02:35:21.448 --> 02:35:22.528]  I'm the one that got a hold of him.
[02:35:23.889 --> 02:35:32.031]  They waited until he drove right over the Mexican border, in his RV, into Baja, knowing it took two days.
[02:35:32.871 --> 02:35:35.312]  When he crossed the Mexican border, they announced it.
[02:35:37.272 --> 02:35:38.633]  Again, it's bigger than Jesse Ventura.
[02:35:39.073 --> 02:35:42.494]  It's the anatomy of a psychological operation.
[02:35:43.303 --> 02:35:51.489]  With News Corp, publishing the book, putting it out, Bill O'Reilly, all of them, about the coward Ventura wanted seals to tie.
[02:35:51.789 --> 02:35:53.390]  And he got knocked out for saying it.
[02:35:53.730 --> 02:35:55.371]  And the hero Chris Kyle did it.
[02:35:55.712 --> 02:35:56.652]  It just wasn't true.
[02:35:59.694 --> 02:36:03.497]  And then what happened to Chris Kyle when Ventura started winning his case?
[02:36:06.179 --> 02:36:10.522]  I'm not even allowed to say how much Ventura, last time I talked to him off air, had already spent.
[02:36:12.247 --> 02:36:16.413]  But it's an unbelievable amount of money.
[02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:22.781]  Let's just say this.
[02:36:24.023 --> 02:36:27.588]  He's not gonna probably basically get any money from the 1.8 million settlement.
[02:36:33.683 --> 02:36:38.266]  The media spun it and lied and said how dare Jesse Ventura want to ruin a widow.
[02:36:38.306 --> 02:36:40.247]  There's an insurance policy with News Corp.
[02:36:40.607 --> 02:36:43.229]  She will not pay a dollar to Jesse Ventura.
[02:36:46.111 --> 02:37:02.121]  But hiding behind a woman, the people that pulled this shenanigan off and told Chris Kyle to do this, need to know that they have now been exposed and defeated.
[02:37:03.936 --> 02:37:06.897]  And if they try to appeal it, I have no doubt that they're going to lose.
[02:37:07.458 --> 02:37:25.846]  Because you can't have a public figure come out and say that someone said, I love it that Navy SEALs are dead, and then that you knock them out, designed to defame in the military community, try to kick him out of his societies, kick him out of his culture.
[02:37:26.986 --> 02:37:30.488]  This is like saying Martin Luther King was a secret Ku Klux Klan member.
[02:37:31.826 --> 02:37:37.008]  And claiming you saw Martin Luther King in a Ku Klux Klan outfit and you're a credible peer.
[02:37:37.468 --> 02:37:44.271]  It'd be like if Martin Luther King's brother came out and said he saw him in a Ku Klux Klan outfit.
[02:37:44.831 --> 02:37:47.452]  I mean, it just... Martin Luther King would have to sue him.
[02:37:49.653 --> 02:37:50.534]  It's just a fraud.
[02:37:50.614 --> 02:37:51.174]  It's a lie.
[02:37:52.677 --> 02:38:01.364]  And I told Opie and Anthony at the time, they called me that next day after Ventura had been on my show a Sunday, right after I told him on that Sunday he came on my show and discussed it.
[02:38:02.165 --> 02:38:12.313]  We ought to, for the nightly news tonight, go get that Sunday radio interview when Ventura was on Skype with us and when he was saying it's totally untrue and he's going to get his name back.
[02:38:14.655 --> 02:38:17.498]  If you could have only heard Jesse Ventura when I told him
[02:38:18.752 --> 02:38:20.074]  And his wife on Skype.
[02:38:20.134 --> 02:38:21.335]  It was crystal clear audio.
[02:38:21.916 --> 02:38:24.459]  I'm not even going to repeat what Jesse did when I told him.
[02:38:29.745 --> 02:38:31.247]  And again, you can say what you want about Ventura.
[02:38:31.267 --> 02:38:32.108]  He's a real guy.
[02:38:32.488 --> 02:38:33.449]  That's why I respect him.
[02:38:33.789 --> 02:38:35.892]  That's why they always say he's not real and he's a fake.
[02:38:36.192 --> 02:38:38.415]  Because all he is is like a good old boy from Minnesota.
[02:38:43.604 --> 02:38:46.966]  And again, the reason this case is important to me is justice.
[02:38:47.426 --> 02:38:50.348]  They can come out and say something horrible about me, folks.
[02:38:51.668 --> 02:38:55.430]  They could set me up in a hundred different ways.
[02:38:56.371 --> 02:38:59.112]  And I need people to come to my aid when that happens, okay?
[02:39:00.673 --> 02:39:06.076]  They could try to set up Matt Drudge, or Joseph Farah, or Ron Paul, or Rand Paul.
[02:39:06.991 --> 02:39:08.633]  You know, they had three different cases.
[02:39:08.773 --> 02:39:10.554]  I should do a whole report on this, it's so important.
[02:39:10.995 --> 02:39:16.340]  When Rand Paul beat the Republican Blue Blood in his Kentucky Senate primary campaign.
[02:39:17.361 --> 02:39:23.247]  And then Mitch McConnell switched from trying to defeat him, the other senator, with money to, you know, working with him.
[02:39:24.488 --> 02:39:29.473]  Because Rand said, I'm going to expose you as not going for another conservative candidate if you don't knock this off.
[02:39:33.362 --> 02:39:44.710]  And then they sent out Democrats dressed up in literal hayseed outfits, overalls, to say, I don't like Mexicans and n-words, and hold up signs, and the National News ran with it.
[02:39:45.250 --> 02:39:50.013]  And I said to the listeners, I said, you gotta go use a Google image search on this guy.
[02:39:51.775 --> 02:39:54.877]  I bet money it's a Democratic operative, and it turned out in every case they were.
[02:39:55.257 --> 02:39:56.338]  They should have all been sued.
[02:39:58.860 --> 02:40:05.085]  I used to go out for land rights rallies and segment rallies, and they'd have Klan guys show up that were clearly Jewish.
[02:40:05.545 --> 02:40:10.089]  I mean, you know, classic Jewish features, and I'd say, you're from the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL.
[02:40:10.289 --> 02:40:11.410]  They'd get mad and run off.
[02:40:11.550 --> 02:40:12.891]  We've got those videos somewhere.
[02:40:15.113 --> 02:40:17.495]  Guys that look like rabbis or something in Klan outfits.
[02:40:17.535 --> 02:40:20.537]  I mean, this is what the left does, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:21.798 --> 02:40:26.802]  And, again, the left-right paradigm is false when you get outside of it, but within it, it's a real issue.
[02:40:28.354 --> 02:40:29.515]  And the sky's the limit.
[02:40:29.575 --> 02:40:34.338]  I mean, they could have somebody that looks like me go paint swastikas on a black church or something.
[02:40:34.438 --> 02:40:35.199]  I didn't do it.
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:37.761]  Rand Paul didn't do it.
[02:40:39.442 --> 02:40:42.484]  If they pull me over and plant drugs on me, I don't use drugs, folks.
[02:40:43.504 --> 02:40:52.851]  I have an extremely clean lifestyle, other than drinking some occasionally, and tobacco products, which I haven't done in five years, and I eat too much sometimes.
[02:40:55.203 --> 02:40:59.786]  And the reason I'm going off on this jag here, before I go to your calls, is because this affects me.
[02:41:00.006 --> 02:41:00.926]  I live under this.
[02:41:02.527 --> 02:41:08.090]  I mean, I've been out there, and I knew it was a hit piece within 30 minutes, because I was already getting calls, it was already on national TV.
[02:41:09.151 --> 02:41:11.432]  I'm at the DNC covering Obama.
[02:41:12.032 --> 02:41:21.057]  They've got anarchists on me, who are hitting me in the back and stuff when no cameras are around, trying to get me to beat them up, with cops waiting to arrest me across the street.
[02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:25.254]  At the Denver Mint, the Federal Reserve Mint.
[02:41:26.996 --> 02:41:34.923]  And these people that later left with Michelle Malkin would get behind me and scream, kill Michelle Malkin.
[02:41:35.663 --> 02:41:43.170]  And then it was on National Radio, USA Today the next day, Extra that night, CNN within an hour.
[02:41:45.111 --> 02:41:46.853]  The end of Alex Jones's career.
[02:41:48.939 --> 02:41:52.883]  He went up to a little lady and said to the crowd, let's kill her.
[02:41:53.484 --> 02:41:54.285]  What a coward.
[02:41:55.786 --> 02:41:58.209]  And they had talking points on national radio shows.
[02:41:58.269 --> 02:41:59.190]  I'm not going to say the name.
[02:42:02.473 --> 02:42:03.595]  And the Dallas Morning News.
[02:42:04.976 --> 02:42:07.599]  I made a bunch of newspapers retract and TV retract.
[02:42:07.939 --> 02:42:09.000]  The Dallas Morning News.
[02:42:10.217 --> 02:42:16.023]  Writer, who also hosts Rush Limbaugh shows sometimes, he told me in emails, he said, I've never attracted nothing.
[02:42:16.843 --> 02:42:18.385]  And I graciously didn't sue him.
[02:42:18.665 --> 02:42:19.906]  I could have gotten a defamation.
[02:42:20.867 --> 02:42:21.888]  I could have won a lawsuit.
[02:42:21.908 --> 02:42:25.051]  But, you know, I had to move on.
[02:42:25.111 --> 02:42:28.714]  It wasn't as defaming as the Ventura thing because it wasn't publicized as much.
[02:42:29.415 --> 02:42:35.621]  But they got photos with AP of me yelling at her when she was saying I was a liar.
[02:42:38.336 --> 02:42:46.939]  Because the Marines were throwing puppies off cliffs, and she said online that I was a liar, it was a robot dog, and I said, you know what, that was a real dog, and I don't appreciate you saying I'm a liar.
[02:42:47.799 --> 02:42:49.740]  And everybody was yelling at me, so I was yelling back at her.
[02:42:53.321 --> 02:42:58.223]  And so they had people stand behind me, who later left with her, saying that I said killer.
[02:42:59.103 --> 02:43:03.004]  I produced the video, stayed up, got it online, and forced retractions.
[02:43:03.145 --> 02:43:07.226]  Again, these are the operations they run against us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:12.281 --> 02:43:14.422]  I mean, for God's sakes, they've been trying to break my family up.
[02:43:15.143 --> 02:43:20.286]  I've been married 12 years, they've been trying to break that up all along with all sorts of behind-the-scenes operations.
[02:43:24.169 --> 02:43:27.551]  So I just want the public to know, man, bad guys run the government, okay?
[02:43:28.111 --> 02:43:28.652]  I've been there.
[02:43:28.992 --> 02:43:39.379]  Dan Bongino, perfect record Secret Service, ran foreign operations, very senior, rising star, handsome, smart guy, former New York police officer.
[02:43:43.499 --> 02:43:49.804]  I mean, they're breaking in his house, they're harassing his kids, they're doing all sorts... He doesn't want to mention it on air and give them the attention.
[02:43:50.204 --> 02:43:53.727]  He just said, I got a gun and I'm ready to break people's necks on the air.
[02:43:53.747 --> 02:43:55.088]  He just said, let me catch who's doing it.
[02:43:55.108 --> 02:44:04.375]  And I don't even want to talk about the stuff I've gone through, because I'm not trying to scare you folks, but people need to understand how real this is.
[02:44:04.395 --> 02:44:07.036]  There are good people at the mid and low levels.
[02:44:07.217 --> 02:44:07.997]  Most of them are good.
[02:44:08.978 --> 02:44:11.380]  But the globalists on top are trying to convince
[02:44:13.132 --> 02:44:18.794]  All the underlings and mid-level to go along with the lies and be part of dirty tricks, and you'll get hung out to dry.
[02:44:19.194 --> 02:44:29.837]  My gut tells me that that so-called PTSD Marine that killed Chris Kyle out at that luxury facility, do you think anybody buys that?
[02:44:31.218 --> 02:44:35.699]  And I've never had a shooting range and they claim some PTSD person shoots me in the head.
[02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:37.420]  Don't believe it.
[02:44:41.937 --> 02:44:47.760]  Chris Kyle had outlived his usefulness, and I give my condolences to his wife, who's being manipulated, and others.
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:54.803]  And I tell her, I'm sorry that your husband was basically executed to cover up the black op on Ventura.
[02:44:55.343 --> 02:45:00.825]  But this black op on Ventura, if it ever all comes down, is the type of thing that could bring down the system.
[02:45:01.626 --> 02:45:04.427]  Certain type things can capture the imagination of people.
[02:45:05.734 --> 02:45:08.455]  And I saw how they executed the whole Ventura operation.
[02:45:09.115 --> 02:45:09.895]  They're scared of him.
[02:45:09.955 --> 02:45:11.195]  That's why he needs to run for president.
[02:45:11.836 --> 02:45:13.856]  Not that he's even right on several issues.
[02:45:14.576 --> 02:45:15.617]  He's real, though.
[02:45:17.077 --> 02:45:18.217]  And that's why they don't like him.
[02:45:20.538 --> 02:45:21.478]  And he's just sick of it.
[02:45:21.498 --> 02:45:22.578]  He's not a narcissist.
[02:45:23.899 --> 02:45:25.559]  He doesn't want to be in the spotlight anymore.
[02:45:25.579 --> 02:45:27.500]  He said, I'm just riding off in the sunset, Alex.
[02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:30.260]  But he shouldn't ride off in the sunset.
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:32.781]  Because that's why they did the Chris Kyle thing.
[02:45:36.786 --> 02:45:37.567]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:45:37.607 --> 02:45:38.227]  I'll shut up now.
[02:45:38.487 --> 02:45:40.189]  George in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:45:41.850 --> 02:45:45.173]  Yeah, I agree with everything you say.
[02:45:45.934 --> 02:45:46.834]  Two quick points.
[02:45:47.475 --> 02:45:50.578]  Who is responsible for vetting a new president?
[02:45:50.878 --> 02:45:51.718]  What's his title?
[02:45:51.779 --> 02:45:52.479]  What's his name?
[02:45:55.361 --> 02:45:58.224]  Who is responsible for vetting a new president?
[02:46:01.297 --> 02:46:10.564]  I mean, they vet them when they're congressmen or senators or governors, and they know where the bodies are buried, they know their M.O., and then the establishment picks who they want to get behind.
[02:46:15.047 --> 02:46:24.314]  Well, it's incredible to me that somebody agrees to grease the barstool for this guy to slide right into the White House, no problem.
[02:46:25.254 --> 02:46:28.217]  Well, that shows the corruption of the entire establishment.
[02:46:29.724 --> 02:46:31.125]  Hey, I'm sick to my heart.
[02:46:31.805 --> 02:46:33.566]  Fought for this country, U.S.
[02:46:33.686 --> 02:46:33.946]  Army.
[02:46:35.127 --> 02:46:37.368]  Sick to my heart over this whole thing.
[02:46:37.548 --> 02:46:38.089]  I hear you, brother.
[02:46:38.129 --> 02:46:38.949]  What war were you in?
[02:46:38.969 --> 02:46:40.810]  Korea.
[02:46:41.991 --> 02:46:42.591]  How old are you?
[02:46:44.652 --> 02:46:45.053]  I'm 82.
[02:46:45.853 --> 02:46:48.895]  Well, we appreciate you calling before you go, brother.
[02:46:49.795 --> 02:46:51.276]  This is the way corruption works.
[02:46:51.356 --> 02:46:54.118]  People just get used to putting up with more and more and more.
[02:46:55.234 --> 02:46:59.837]  Until the civilization collapses, and that's why I say this elite is out of their mind.
[02:47:00.277 --> 02:47:04.299]  Even if we had an evil elite before, they weren't destructive of their own system.
[02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:07.781]  And the people running things now are deviant.
[02:47:08.282 --> 02:47:12.904]  They want... They hate America so much that they really want to wreck it.
[02:47:14.025 --> 02:47:23.931]  And that's why I want to warn people in the establishment, even if you're not good guys and you're sociopaths, you should want to be against this because it will destabilize things,
[02:47:25.151 --> 02:47:27.192]  There's not a lot of room at the top in this system.
[02:47:27.593 --> 02:47:31.675]  This is not a good thing we're going into, even from an evil perspective.
[02:47:32.716 --> 02:47:39.760]  So if you're not totally turned over to evil, you just have gone along with it for your own mercenary reasons.
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:41.701]  You should not want to be for this, folks.
[02:47:42.742 --> 02:47:44.063]  Because it's really bad.
[02:47:45.044 --> 02:47:46.284]  There's no bottom to this thing.
[02:47:46.344 --> 02:47:47.505]  It's as evil as it gets.
[02:47:48.046 --> 02:47:49.426]  Nobody should want to sign on to this.
[02:47:49.446 --> 02:47:50.167]  I just got chills.
[02:47:50.507 --> 02:47:51.027]  Thank you, George.
[02:47:51.067 --> 02:47:51.728]  God bless you, brother.
[02:47:53.661 --> 02:48:03.665]  Yeah, I had a, well, my grandmother's brother, William Pope, was a senior at the Dallas Federal Reserve, you know, senior level manager.
[02:48:05.045 --> 02:48:10.388]  From the time he got out of the Navy and did intelligence work and stuff after World War II.
[02:48:11.528 --> 02:48:14.549]  And he would listen to my show in Dallas.
[02:48:14.889 --> 02:48:16.350]  He died about seven years ago.
[02:48:18.671 --> 02:48:19.211]  Uncle Billy.
[02:48:21.235 --> 02:48:24.338]  And he would say, a lot of what you're saying is true, but a lot of it isn't by the end.
[02:48:24.358 --> 02:48:25.418]  And he was all there when he died.
[02:48:25.438 --> 02:48:27.020]  He had total IQ when he died.
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:30.282]  He was just as smart as he was when I was a little kid.
[02:48:30.803 --> 02:48:31.844]  He was like, no, it's all true.
[02:48:31.864 --> 02:48:32.204]  You're right.
[02:48:32.244 --> 02:48:32.724]  I looked into it.
[02:48:32.764 --> 02:48:33.385]  I can't believe it.
[02:48:33.925 --> 02:48:35.987]  I mean, there are good people throughout the system.
[02:48:36.748 --> 02:48:38.349]  It's just they, they're so close to it.
[02:48:38.789 --> 02:48:39.570]  They're good people.
[02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:41.832]  So they rationalize what's going on.
[02:48:42.352 --> 02:48:43.153]  Let's go ahead.
[02:48:43.293 --> 02:48:49.098]  And I had a lot of other family as well that Uncle Leonard just died a couple of years ago and he was in Korea.
[02:48:50.913 --> 02:48:54.095]  And he ran some of the biggest oil refineries in Houston.
[02:48:54.135 --> 02:48:55.455]  He was a very successful engineer.
[02:48:56.616 --> 02:48:58.457]  And he was a high-level mason as well.
[02:48:59.717 --> 02:49:02.339]  And he didn't believe a lot of this stuff until near the time he died.
[02:49:02.359 --> 02:49:03.539]  And he was all there when he died.
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:06.861]  And he was like, no, you're right about all this stuff.
[02:49:06.921 --> 02:49:07.942]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:49:08.622 --> 02:49:10.083]  Fred Marilyn, you're on the air.
[02:49:10.143 --> 02:49:10.543]  Go ahead.
[02:49:11.623 --> 02:49:12.204]  Hi, Alex.
[02:49:12.424 --> 02:49:12.804]  Hey, buddy.
[02:49:13.724 --> 02:49:15.805]  I got two things I want to talk about.
[02:49:15.886 --> 02:49:18.707]  I want to talk about the... Just turn your radio off.
[02:49:19.547 --> 02:49:19.868]  Okay.
[02:49:22.603 --> 02:49:26.686]  I spoke about the impeachment of Obama.
[02:49:27.246 --> 02:49:28.627]  Yes, were you for it or against it?
[02:49:28.667 --> 02:49:34.011]  Number one, I found his impeachment articles on the internet.
[02:49:36.033 --> 02:49:37.474]  Brother, you didn't turn your radio off.
[02:49:37.714 --> 02:49:38.755]  I'm sorry.
[02:49:38.775 --> 02:49:41.297]  I'm his mother's brother.
[02:49:41.777 --> 02:49:43.458]  I want to hear you, but you're interrupting yourself.
[02:49:43.498 --> 02:49:43.858]  Go ahead.
[02:49:44.819 --> 02:49:47.701]  He's being charged with three things.
[02:49:48.902 --> 02:49:51.344]  He's going to be charged, hopefully, if he gets charged.
[02:49:53.106 --> 02:49:54.607]  Ooh, that's a good article to write!
[02:49:55.307 --> 02:50:00.388]  Mock articles of impeachment against Obama and why I think he should be impeached.
[02:50:00.748 --> 02:50:02.549]  We need to get on that article and get that written.
[02:50:02.729 --> 02:50:04.070]  That's very well said.
[02:50:04.090 --> 02:50:06.670]  I mean, I'm sure other people have done it, that's what you're alluding to, but that's a good idea.
[02:50:06.690 --> 02:50:10.691]  Identity theft is Article 1.
[02:50:12.152 --> 02:50:13.872]  It has 10 sub-items to it.
[02:50:16.633 --> 02:50:18.814]  Brother, I gotta let you go because the radio's on.
[02:50:18.874 --> 02:50:22.015]  I appreciate ya, but it's hard to understand.
[02:50:23.550 --> 02:50:27.914]  We don't need to go with the identity theft even though they've run a social security number and it shows as a fake.
[02:50:28.354 --> 02:50:28.834]  That's true.
[02:50:29.655 --> 02:50:31.797]  We don't even know exactly who he is, okay?
[02:50:32.597 --> 02:50:34.078]  But you can't prove that cut and dry.
[02:50:34.439 --> 02:50:36.921]  You can prove cut and dry he ran fast and furious.
[02:50:37.181 --> 02:50:39.523]  You can prove cut and dry he ordered a stand down in Benghazi.
[02:50:39.783 --> 02:50:42.525]  You can prove cut and dry he's ordered the border to stand down.
[02:50:42.565 --> 02:50:43.266]  We have the witnesses.
[02:50:44.534 --> 02:50:47.715]  You can prove Cut and Dry gave billions to energy companies that did nothing with it.
[02:50:48.035 --> 02:50:50.596]  You can prove Cut and Dry put our military under NATO command.
[02:50:50.976 --> 02:50:55.158]  You can prove Cut and Dry became the head of the UN Security Council, violation of Article 1, Section 9.
[02:50:55.378 --> 02:50:57.899]  You can prove about 50 other things.
[02:50:59.419 --> 02:51:01.400]  So, we gotta impeach him.
[02:51:02.180 --> 02:51:06.322]  Even if it turns him into a martyr with the turds, you know, that run the Democratic Party.
[02:51:06.522 --> 02:51:06.962]  Doesn't matter.
[02:51:09.477 --> 02:51:12.898]  A 30-day GMO-free emergency food supply for only $99?
[02:51:13.138 --> 02:51:22.301]  At 30dayfoodsupply.com, you can purchase Oregon Trail Foods' one-month supply of high-quality, nutritious, and healthy emergency meals.
[02:51:22.361 --> 02:51:30.624]  For less than $100, these vegetarian meals are naturally high in fiber, carbs, and protein, and they're packed with oxygen absorbers in Mylar pouches.

[02:52:08.805 --> 02:52:10.845]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[02:52:11.205 --> 02:52:24.188]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[02:52:25.268 --> 02:52:26.949]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[02:52:27.189 --> 02:52:29.350]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[02:52:29.390 --> 02:52:35.472]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:52:35.792 --> 02:52:43.815]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[02:52:44.375 --> 02:52:49.878]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[02:52:50.098 --> 02:52:57.041]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[02:52:57.422 --> 02:52:58.402]  Or go to faketv.com.
[02:52:58.522 --> 02:53:00.283]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:53:08.467 --> 02:53:12.069]  Get the most important package of information you'll ever receive in your life for only $10.
[02:53:12.209 --> 02:53:17.992]  The package includes three books and seven DVD programs which cover biblical miracles and prophecy.

[02:53:23.114 --> 02:53:23.415]  Call 800-513-0029.

[02:53:24.815 --> 02:53:25.616]  That's VaticanCatholic.com.
[02:53:25.636 --> 02:53:25.676]  800-513-0029.
[02:53:25.696 --> 02:53:26.076]  VaticanCatholic.com.
[02:53:38.402 --> 02:53:43.324]  Gentlemen, in search of a million-dollar smile that'll make them take notice, I mean really get their attention?
[02:53:43.704 --> 02:53:44.605]  Then get the mud!
[02:53:45.045 --> 02:53:46.025]  My Magic Mud.
[02:53:46.466 --> 02:53:50.988]  The fluoride-free whitener with no chemicals, additives, GMOs, or bad taste.
[02:53:51.408 --> 02:53:52.368]  And safe to swallow.

[02:53:58.811 --> 02:54:01.252]  Comes as a powder for pure whitening power.
[02:54:01.612 --> 02:54:03.633]  Start looking good for that special someone.
[02:54:04.014 --> 02:54:05.054]  Get the mud now.
[02:54:05.434 --> 02:54:06.595]  MyMagicMud.com
[02:54:27.435 --> 02:54:29.736]  I'm going to go into overdrive so we can finish talking to Mike.
[02:54:32.778 --> 02:54:35.420]  Jared, this is the order I'm going to go to you.
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:37.301]  Phil, Crystal and Marcus.
[02:54:38.762 --> 02:54:45.687]  Again, Jesse Ventura wins $1.8 million in the defamation lawsuit against Chris Kyle.
[02:54:47.455 --> 02:54:48.095]  Who wrote a book?
[02:54:48.396 --> 02:54:49.597]  Lying about Jesse Ventura!
[02:54:49.617 --> 02:54:53.299]  So there's justice right there.
[02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:55.281]  I tell you, you messed with the wrong guy, man.
[02:54:56.301 --> 02:55:00.244]  People like, talk shows make jokes, oh yeah, he's gonna sue people, Alex.
[02:55:00.685 --> 02:55:02.326]  Sure he is, and I'm just like, wow.
[02:55:02.966 --> 02:55:05.048]  You better watch out lest you get put on the list.
[02:55:08.790 --> 02:55:12.393]  I mean, Jesse Ventura is old-fashioned, folks.
[02:55:12.693 --> 02:55:14.134]  He does what he says he's gonna do.
[02:55:16.196 --> 02:55:16.316]  And,
[02:55:18.078 --> 02:55:22.242]  I've not sued people except a couple times when they mess with my sister and family.
[02:55:22.322 --> 02:55:23.823]  I've done a few defamations in one.
[02:55:24.604 --> 02:55:25.485]  They settle out of court.
[02:55:27.627 --> 02:55:30.709]  But I don't like just stomping on people just for no reason.
[02:55:31.490 --> 02:55:32.271]  Just because they're scum.
[02:55:33.695 --> 02:55:36.597]  Unless it's such a big issue, you've got to get your name back.
[02:55:37.257 --> 02:55:41.380]  That's what I always tell people that are defaming me, or lying about me, or trying to shut down my operation.
[02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:45.022]  I go, listen, your biggest problem will be if you're ever successful.
[02:55:45.042 --> 02:55:50.486]  Because you ever wound me, you ever hurt me, then I'm going to come after you, and then I'm going to win.
[02:55:52.007 --> 02:55:54.148]  But the world's full of these people that think they're invincible.
[02:55:55.369 --> 02:55:58.351]  And think they've got the moral high ground to make stuff up about you.
[02:55:59.192 --> 02:55:59.672]  And they don't.
[02:56:03.012 --> 02:56:04.072]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[02:56:04.292 --> 02:56:06.753]  Just briefly, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:07.934 --> 02:56:09.154]  You guys bring me that glass of water in.
[02:56:09.174 --> 02:56:09.654]  Thanks a lot.
[02:56:11.695 --> 02:56:12.375]  I ran out of water.
[02:56:12.855 --> 02:56:19.817]  I have forgotten to take my Super Mel Vitality today from Infowarslife.com, and I've forgotten to take my Survival Shield X2 today.
[02:56:19.877 --> 02:56:26.759]  I usually take it three times a day, and I like to mix it with water, and I take a couple squirts of Super Mel Vitality.
[02:56:26.779 --> 02:56:27.920]  It's got the
[02:56:29.022 --> 02:56:37.965]  Organic concentrated cold-pressed herbs and other key compounds just invigorate everything from libido to energy and get you in shape.
[02:56:39.065 --> 02:56:45.927]  Then I stir it up and I put some of the mystery liquid in that isn't out yet.
[02:56:45.947 --> 02:56:49.328]  I need a spoon to stir this up.
[02:56:50.988 --> 02:56:53.989]  And then I drink it and it's been life-changing.
[02:56:54.029 --> 02:56:56.810]  I'm still an ugly creature but I tell you I've lost a lot of weight.
[02:56:56.850 --> 02:56:57.450]  I feel great.
[02:56:59.148 --> 02:57:05.411]  And it's just amazing that other product companies just won't pay the money to put out something really nice.
[02:57:05.511 --> 02:57:08.192]  They'll spend $2 on the bottle and the contents.
[02:57:08.252 --> 02:57:09.233]  Bringing you a spoon there.
[02:57:10.133 --> 02:57:12.094]  And then they will sell it for $30.
[02:57:13.215 --> 02:57:14.695]  We'll spend $16 to $18 and sell it for $30.
[02:57:14.755 --> 02:57:16.776]  Or we'll spend $25 and sell it for $60.
[02:57:23.530 --> 02:57:24.270]  And what's a markup?
[02:57:24.331 --> 02:57:25.511]  It's how we fund our operation.
[02:57:25.751 --> 02:57:26.292]  So thank you.
[02:57:26.632 --> 02:57:31.895]  But we're coming out with a product tomorrow that costs $12,000 a kilo.
[02:57:33.016 --> 02:57:34.277]  Just one of the ingredients.
[02:57:34.797 --> 02:57:40.820]  It is the most fancy nutraceutical proven, patented, anyone's ever put out that we know of.
[02:57:41.401 --> 02:57:42.562]  It's like an over-the-top.
[02:57:42.622 --> 02:57:49.826]  It's like Dodge is coming out with a Hellcat that's 707 horsepower and will smoke Lamborghinis or Ferraris off the lot.
[02:57:50.847 --> 02:57:53.008]  We're putting the Hellcat of supplements out tomorrow.
[02:57:54.935 --> 02:57:58.097]  A comparable supplement would cost $600 per bottle.
[02:57:59.778 --> 02:58:02.399]  This absolutely will change the industry.
[02:58:03.340 --> 02:58:06.581]  Oh, we're going to sell it for $135 because it costs 50-something bucks a bottle.
[02:58:06.602 --> 02:58:08.623]  With marketing and the rest of it, $75 a bottle?
[02:58:08.643 --> 02:58:11.344]  $80 a bottle?
[02:58:18.621 --> 02:58:22.123]  And something comparable that isn't even as strong as the same patented U.S.
[02:58:22.383 --> 02:58:24.024]  grade stuff, $600 to $1,000.
[02:58:24.405 --> 02:58:27.887]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:28.147 --> 02:58:32.129]  We've got products for $19.95, like Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, close to selling out.
[02:58:32.670 --> 02:58:35.731]  And we've got stuff up to Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality.
[02:58:36.372 --> 02:58:38.593]  We've got the Nascent X2 for $29.95.
[02:58:39.213 --> 02:58:40.634]  All of it supports the broadcast.
[02:58:40.694 --> 02:58:41.455]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:41.495 --> 02:58:44.457]  And the best part is it funds the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:58:48.579 --> 02:58:49.261]  Take the challenge.
[02:58:49.321 --> 02:58:49.642]  Try it.
[02:58:49.662 --> 02:58:50.804]  You'll see how powerful it is.
[02:58:50.824 --> 02:58:52.528]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[02:58:53.109 --> 02:58:54.572]  Oh yeah, calls from Brazil.
[02:58:55.013 --> 02:58:56.757]  I may do a whole half hour of overdrive.
[02:58:56.777 --> 02:58:57.258]  Stay with us.
[02:58:59.443 --> 02:59:02.026]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[02:59:02.246 --> 02:59:07.412]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[02:59:07.432 --> 02:59:12.538]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[02:59:14.260 --> 02:59:18.765]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[02:59:18.925 --> 02:59:20.566]  There's only 500 of each.
[02:59:20.806 --> 02:59:24.947]  We're talking about Made in America, belt buckles, and nickel brass.
[02:59:25.027 --> 02:59:27.088]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[02:59:27.288 --> 02:59:30.229]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[02:59:30.409 --> 02:59:34.371]  But to expand the info war, we're offering the equivalent of more than
[02:59:34.591 --> 02:59:41.873]  Five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[02:59:42.153 --> 02:59:45.674]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[02:59:46.034 --> 02:59:52.276]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[02:59:52.636 --> 02:59:57.717]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[03:00:00.037 --> 03:00:01.221]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:01.582 --> 03:00:02.945]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.647 --> 03:00:06.857]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:15.103 --> 03:00:19.265]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:19.945 --> 03:00:20.745]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.526 --> 03:00:22.446]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:23.066 --> 03:00:26.688]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:27.248 --> 03:00:31.350]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.570 --> 03:00:40.534]  Alright, I'm doing at least 20 minutes of overdrive.
[03:00:41.134 --> 03:00:42.715]  I gotta cut it off then, cause I'm gonna...
[03:00:44.147 --> 03:00:46.108]  Yeah, Lieberman Live, one of the Howard Stern Shows.
[03:00:48.530 --> 03:00:49.250]  So that's coming up.
[03:00:51.272 --> 03:00:52.292]  Nightly News tonight at 7.
[03:00:52.352 --> 03:00:55.835]  I'm gonna tape some stuff of the Nightly News tonight on a host of fronts.
[03:00:55.875 --> 03:01:00.618]  So guys, be ready at, I don't know, 3 o'clock in the studio.
[03:01:02.219 --> 03:01:04.701]  I got a couple things I want to tape for the Nightly News.
[03:01:04.721 --> 03:01:05.682]  7 o'clock central tonight.
[03:01:06.703 --> 03:01:10.506]  I'm going to go to Mike and others, but Marcos has been holding from Brazil.
[03:01:10.586 --> 03:01:12.167]  He wants to talk about Gaza.
[03:01:12.627 --> 03:01:14.169]  So you're up first, sir.
[03:01:14.189 --> 03:01:14.589]  Go ahead.
[03:01:14.609 --> 03:01:19.613]  And he hung up right when I went to him.
[03:01:19.693 --> 03:01:21.114]  Mike in California, you're on the air.
[03:01:21.414 --> 03:01:22.695]  To impeach or not to impeach?
[03:01:22.756 --> 03:01:23.516]  That is the question.
[03:01:24.577 --> 03:01:25.237]  Hello, Alex.
[03:01:25.298 --> 03:01:30.722]  Regarding impeachment, this may be a pipe dream, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
[03:01:32.253 --> 03:01:49.381]  I just believe that we have a small window of opportunity to push the conversation toward a simple tyranny versus freedom debate, and therefore impeachment must include Obama, Biden, and Boehner to force the conversation beyond the right-left paradigm.
[03:01:49.541 --> 03:01:54.763]  And if that could be done, regardless of whether the Senate would convict or not, we would likely
[03:01:55.399 --> 03:02:01.401]  In my mind, force the police state to decloak and give us the moral high ground that the conflict is unfolding.
[03:02:02.341 --> 03:02:06.603]  No, no, I agree with you that we've got a lot of reasons to impeach Obama.
[03:02:07.203 --> 03:02:10.444]  And I get that we could have impeached other presidents, but it's getting so bad.
[03:02:11.324 --> 03:02:16.986]  We need to just do it because it's the right thing to do and not just score political points because he's so horrible.
[03:02:17.606 --> 03:02:20.367]  Because the Republican leadership is involved in all this as well.
[03:02:21.235 --> 03:02:23.757]  And I want John Boehner impeached.
[03:02:24.618 --> 03:02:32.904]  I think that would be a very moral course, would be purge the Republican leadership and the Democrats, and lock their butts in prison.
[03:02:34.625 --> 03:02:38.728]  And not have the next Republican president or Libertarian president pardon their butts.
[03:02:39.669 --> 03:02:43.491]  I mean, a bunch of Nixon's people ended up going to prison.
[03:02:45.132 --> 03:02:46.173]  People in his cabinet.
[03:02:46.834 --> 03:02:48.275]  Let's lock them up.
[03:02:49.531 --> 03:02:51.913]  But if you don't lock up criminals, they become tyrants.
[03:02:52.994 --> 03:02:56.578]  And people say, well it's not a pipe dream, you know, of course it's not a pipe dream.
[03:02:56.898 --> 03:02:59.501]  We have open and shut reasons to impeach Obama right now.
[03:03:00.122 --> 03:03:00.722]  Open and shut.
[03:03:01.443 --> 03:03:03.165]  And by the way, I wanted Bush impeached!
[03:03:04.286 --> 03:03:07.129]  For NSA, and Nancy Pelosi wouldn't do it because she was involved.
[03:03:08.047 --> 03:03:09.108]  I mean, I'm consistent.
[03:03:09.128 --> 03:03:19.935]  I've had Democrats on the street go, I used to like you a little bit, because, you know, you were for civil liberties and stuff, but, you know, you're not for, you know, going after Republicans.
[03:03:21.376 --> 03:03:24.679]  To H-E double hockey sticks, I'm not.
[03:03:26.460 --> 03:03:29.002]  I'm absolutely for going after all these people.
[03:03:29.542 --> 03:03:30.303]  I'm sick of it!
[03:03:31.883 --> 03:03:33.123]  I want to live in a free country!
[03:03:33.944 --> 03:03:37.005]  I understand the danger of a growing tyranny.
[03:03:37.865 --> 03:03:39.646]  I understand that I'm in danger.
[03:03:40.886 --> 03:03:45.108]  Just like I catch somebody trying to break into my house, man, I get really aggressive and really angry.
[03:03:46.328 --> 03:03:48.969]  And go on a, you know, killer-guerrilla mode.
[03:03:50.209 --> 03:03:51.090]  Because I'm a man!
[03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:55.952]  I take it personal when the government's turning into a bunch of black uniformed thugs.
[03:03:58.332 --> 03:03:59.933]  Anyways, what else you want to say about that, Mike?
[03:04:00.635 --> 03:04:11.820]  Well I just wanted to pose the question of basing this whole impeachment on something as simple as the secret documents to install NAFTA in the United States.
[03:04:12.940 --> 03:04:15.261]  When it gets really confusing and it gets trying to
[03:04:16.214 --> 03:04:18.515]  Definitely the wisdom is to simplify.
[03:04:18.715 --> 03:04:24.877]  And so if we could get it as simple as possible, and yet go for the whole enchilada, you know?
[03:04:25.257 --> 03:04:27.018]  Well, I think I'm going to get up off my butt.
[03:04:27.418 --> 03:04:32.100]  I mean, I wrote my plan for the second American revolution a few years ago, got national attention.
[03:04:33.140 --> 03:04:35.661]  Constitutional law scholars read it and said it was a very good plan.
[03:04:35.681 --> 03:04:40.722]  But that took me about a week to write.
[03:04:41.443 --> 03:04:42.043]  I'm going to do it.
[03:04:42.083 --> 03:04:44.884]  I'm going to come up with articles of impeachment for Obama.
[03:04:45.779 --> 03:04:46.759]  That's a great idea.
[03:04:46.799 --> 03:04:47.620]  It'll go viral.
[03:04:48.040 --> 03:04:49.160]  It'll point out the crimes.
[03:04:50.300 --> 03:04:53.782]  And then we can have a debate about impeachment, which will focus on his crimes.
[03:04:54.262 --> 03:04:57.123]  I just want the raping of the country to stop.
[03:04:57.143 --> 03:04:58.943]  The end of the country.
[03:04:58.963 --> 03:05:00.444]  The looting for the foreign banks.
[03:05:00.524 --> 03:05:01.224]  The bailouts.
[03:05:01.784 --> 03:05:02.724]  The open borders.
[03:05:02.764 --> 03:05:03.645]  The gun control.
[03:05:04.025 --> 03:05:05.305]  Just all of it.
[03:05:05.625 --> 03:05:07.006]  The starting war with Russia.
[03:05:07.126 --> 03:05:07.946]  I'm sick of it.
[03:05:09.932 --> 03:05:12.695]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:05:12.935 --> 03:05:18.802]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.

[03:05:45.685 --> 03:05:51.229]  When he brought me home, the bottle Super Female, I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[03:05:51.309 --> 03:05:52.930]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[03:05:53.130 --> 03:05:54.251]  Our relationship, all I can say is,

[03:06:42.128 --> 03:06:48.253]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.

[03:08:21.337 --> 03:08:28.321]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:08:28.882 --> 03:08:32.584]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:38.648 --> 03:08:40.489]  We're in overdrive, taking your phone calls.
[03:08:40.529 --> 03:08:41.230]  Thanks for holding.
[03:08:41.330 --> 03:08:44.151]  Jared in California, you're on the air.
[03:08:44.232 --> 03:08:44.672]  Go ahead.
[03:08:46.353 --> 03:08:47.354]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[03:08:47.594 --> 03:08:48.014]  Good, brother.
[03:08:49.167 --> 03:08:53.668]  Hey, I want to talk about the impeachment.
[03:08:53.688 --> 03:09:08.591]  I would say the biggest issue with the whole thing is that if we don't impeach him, then he's going to be able to get all these illegals that are able to vote, and even if we do wait for two years, no matter what's going to happen, they're going to be able to vote for whoever they tell them to.
[03:09:10.112 --> 03:09:10.692]  Absolutely.
[03:09:10.732 --> 03:09:15.213]  If these illegals were pro-gun, pro-Republic, and weren't going to go on welfare,
[03:09:17.529 --> 03:09:24.951]  I would be forgiving them amnesty, but they are a bunch of moms with kids that are gonna literally vote to make me their slave.
[03:09:26.231 --> 03:09:29.112]  I mean, I would have to be suicidal to support this.
[03:09:29.752 --> 03:09:31.973]  I don't care if you're black, white, Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[03:09:32.653 --> 03:09:35.934]  People, if you're tired of being loser chumps, don't support this.
[03:09:37.148 --> 03:09:43.655]  I'm so sick of the lottery mentality of dumb people where they just buy into whatever the bull is because it sounds good.
[03:09:43.735 --> 03:09:48.821]  I mean, it's just the New World Order wants open borders everywhere for a reason.
[03:09:50.014 --> 03:09:52.977]  To literally turn us all into third world slaves.
[03:09:53.317 --> 03:09:55.940]  And I feel sorry and empathize for those third world slaves.
[03:09:56.780 --> 03:10:00.544]  And I really feel bad that I can't figure out a political way to help these people.
[03:10:00.924 --> 03:10:02.245]  But you can't help them.
[03:10:02.786 --> 03:10:05.629]  Just like a lifeboat that can hold a hundred people.
[03:10:06.309 --> 03:10:08.271]  It sinks when you put a hundred and twenty in it.
[03:10:09.212 --> 03:10:10.894]  The boat's already sinking.
[03:10:10.914 --> 03:10:12.095]  We already got too many in.
[03:10:14.173 --> 03:10:17.934]  Switzerland doesn't let you in if you're rich and white, folks.
[03:10:18.594 --> 03:10:25.055]  And they literally are so successful they're just bathing in money and wealth.
[03:10:25.615 --> 03:10:27.115]  And there's other countries like that as well.
[03:10:28.916 --> 03:10:32.736]  They won't let a rich black guy in unless he's got some big skills they can bring.
[03:10:32.936 --> 03:10:34.397]  They don't care what color you are.
[03:10:35.237 --> 03:10:36.757]  They want you to have a bunch of skills.
[03:10:37.057 --> 03:10:40.418]  If you're a nuclear physicist and make a bunch of patents, you don't have to have money.
[03:10:40.438 --> 03:10:41.298]  They'll let you into Switzerland.
[03:10:42.717 --> 03:10:46.338]  If you're a professor and have written a bunch of best-selling books, they'll let you into Switzerland.
[03:10:47.219 --> 03:10:50.000]  If you're Richard Scarry and write children's books, they'll let you into Switzerland.
[03:10:51.180 --> 03:10:54.422]  But if you just have five million dollars, they might not let you into Switzerland.
[03:10:55.702 --> 03:10:57.903]  And that's what it comes down to, because they're not idiots.
[03:10:58.423 --> 03:10:59.563]  They care about their country.
[03:11:00.564 --> 03:11:04.105]  And again, we're bordering failed third world nations.
[03:11:05.066 --> 03:11:05.746]  It's suicidal.
[03:11:05.766 --> 03:11:06.406]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[03:11:07.487 --> 03:11:09.267]  I just got a question for you.
[03:11:09.647 --> 03:11:11.148]  Let's say we did impeach him.
[03:11:11.937 --> 03:11:14.759]  Would you say that we could even send the illegals back?
[03:11:14.819 --> 03:11:15.880]  Is that even possible?
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:16.740]  Absolutely!
[03:11:16.820 --> 03:11:19.943]  You load them on planes and you deport them to their country of origin.
[03:11:20.503 --> 03:11:30.270]  That costs a few thousand dollars maximum instead of millions of dollars for all the tuition and all the school lunch programs and all the welfare and all the rest of it.
[03:11:30.770 --> 03:11:40.457]  So then their kids can be taught about gangster bang-bang music on MTV meant to totally screw their minds up so they can be prepared for the prison population.
[03:11:42.421 --> 03:11:44.742]  Well, that's not really what I meant by that question.
[03:11:44.762 --> 03:11:50.423]  What I mean is, let's say we did impeach him, how far down would we have to go for someone to actually be able to do that?
[03:11:50.623 --> 03:11:51.243]  It doesn't matter.
[03:11:51.283 --> 03:11:52.624]  It scares all the criminals.
[03:11:53.804 --> 03:11:56.225]  So they would just... Oh no, we don't just impeach Obama.
[03:11:56.245 --> 03:12:01.066]  You take down the front man politically, and we can arrest Lois Lerner.
[03:12:02.361 --> 03:12:03.622]  Indict her, she'll go to prison.
[03:12:04.102 --> 03:12:06.283]  I mean, I could go on as a prosecutor right now.
[03:12:06.483 --> 03:12:07.224]  She'd be going to prison.
[03:12:07.664 --> 03:12:08.985]  I mean, the evidence is all on record.
[03:12:09.005 --> 03:12:10.105]  They've already been caught lying about it.
[03:12:10.145 --> 03:12:10.366]  Boom.
[03:12:10.626 --> 03:12:11.686]  We have her on obstruction.
[03:12:11.966 --> 03:12:13.047]  We have her on absconding.
[03:12:13.067 --> 03:12:14.328]  We have her on destruction of evidence.
[03:12:14.748 --> 03:12:16.169]  We have her on wire fraud.
[03:12:16.209 --> 03:12:17.370]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[03:12:18.130 --> 03:12:18.750]  Just all of them.
[03:12:19.171 --> 03:12:25.894]  You could all have federal trials and put, I don't know, I don't want to put them in FEMA camps or anything, because that would be turning into them.
[03:12:26.615 --> 03:12:28.516]  I'd say we'd probably put 5,000 of them in prison.
[03:12:29.448 --> 03:12:32.010]  We could convict almost every one of them, open and shut.
[03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:34.651]  I mean, look at the former head of the EPA.
[03:12:34.671 --> 03:12:38.934]  He had fake email accounts committing criminal operations under fake names.
[03:12:40.014 --> 03:12:40.735]  Of course she did.
[03:12:41.655 --> 03:12:45.378]  Premeditated criminal operations under fake names.
[03:12:46.434 --> 03:12:47.175]  Send her to prison.
[03:12:47.435 --> 03:12:47.815]  All of them.
[03:12:48.236 --> 03:12:49.537]  Slap their ass in prison.
[03:12:50.137 --> 03:12:50.998]  I appreciate your call.
[03:12:51.779 --> 03:12:53.621]  And again, I don't have some hatred of them.
[03:12:53.981 --> 03:12:55.202]  Let me tell you, these are dangerous people.
[03:12:55.763 --> 03:12:58.325]  I don't like getting up here to mafia dons and saying put them in prison.
[03:12:58.585 --> 03:13:01.528]  But they're destroying my country and your country.
[03:13:01.748 --> 03:13:03.690]  They're not giving us any way out, folks.
[03:13:03.890 --> 03:13:05.151]  They're not going to back off.
[03:13:06.813 --> 03:13:12.438]  It's just like when you're 12 years old and you're walking home from the bus stop and three bullies that are 16 get around you.
[03:13:13.843 --> 03:13:15.284]  And start punching you in the head.
[03:13:15.364 --> 03:13:21.647]  You might as well, when they tackle you, go ahead and bite them on the calf and bite a big bloody chunk out.
[03:13:21.667 --> 03:13:22.968]  They're never going to mess with you again.
[03:13:23.048 --> 03:13:24.008]  I did that when I was 12.
[03:13:24.669 --> 03:13:26.290]  These guys were beating on me, stomping on me.
[03:13:26.330 --> 03:13:27.670]  I tried to stand up and fist fight them.
[03:13:28.071 --> 03:13:28.711]  They were bigger than me.
[03:13:28.751 --> 03:13:30.212]  They held me down, were punching me in the head.
[03:13:30.432 --> 03:13:32.893]  I just reached over and bit a huge chunk out of the guy's leg.
[03:13:33.994 --> 03:13:37.876]  Tried to sue my parents and the cops came and they said, no, they attacked your son.
[03:13:40.060 --> 03:13:44.002]  I mean, you got the will to bite a big, bloody chunk out of somebody, you can kick the New World Order's ass.
[03:13:44.523 --> 03:13:48.685]  They're not giving us a choice, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm politically biting chunks right now.
[03:13:50.326 --> 03:13:52.467]  You got somebody sitting on top of you, you can't breathe?
[03:13:52.708 --> 03:13:53.148]  Bite them!
[03:13:54.569 --> 03:13:56.030]  They're not giving us a way out.
[03:13:56.250 --> 03:13:57.390]  Don't people understand that?
[03:13:58.171 --> 03:13:58.851]  They're pushing!
[03:13:59.292 --> 03:14:00.292]  They're asking for it!
[03:14:02.433 --> 03:14:04.335]  They're not gonna back off, people.
[03:14:04.695 --> 03:14:05.275]  Don't you get it?
[03:14:05.295 --> 03:14:06.216]  There isn't a choice.
[03:14:09.482 --> 03:14:13.184]  They're going for broke because they know they're all going to prison if we turn this around.
[03:14:13.204 --> 03:14:19.447]  The only way they feel safe is bankrupting you and your family and putting checkpoints at every street corner with men in black uniforms.
[03:14:19.687 --> 03:14:20.767]  You want to live in that country?
[03:14:21.208 --> 03:14:21.848]  Huh, cops?
[03:14:22.208 --> 03:14:23.409]  That where you want to live, too?
[03:14:24.449 --> 03:14:26.150]  Let's go ahead and talk to Phil in Ohio.
[03:14:26.190 --> 03:14:26.830]  You're on the air.
[03:14:29.612 --> 03:14:30.812]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:14:31.012 --> 03:14:32.813]  Pray for you and yours daily.
[03:14:34.434 --> 03:14:36.155]  Education is the key.
[03:14:36.535 --> 03:14:38.816]  What you've been doing for 19 years
[03:14:39.722 --> 03:14:47.586]  Eventually we're gonna get these rat bastards and we can start with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:14:48.867 --> 03:15:01.594]  Obama, to get him impeached, all you need to do is read the articles of the Constitution and look at his record and you could send him down the road for treason.
[03:15:02.394 --> 03:15:05.576]  Get him on trial and hang his no good butt.
[03:15:08.069 --> 03:15:09.670]  Well, that would certainly send a message.
[03:15:09.690 --> 03:15:13.393]  And for the Secret Service, that's not a threat because anybody can be convicted.
[03:15:13.433 --> 03:15:14.753]  The President's not above the law.
[03:15:15.134 --> 03:15:18.876]  And if you are convicted of treason or high treason, that is the penalty.
[03:15:19.297 --> 03:15:20.798]  I think that would turn him into a martyr.
[03:15:21.178 --> 03:15:24.220]  We should send him to an island like we did Napoleon.
[03:15:25.801 --> 03:15:30.444]  Well, sending him somewhere to jail would be best.
[03:15:32.714 --> 03:15:33.695]  That's all I got.
[03:15:34.055 --> 03:15:34.735]  Don't quit.
[03:15:35.195 --> 03:15:35.556]  I won't.
[03:15:35.676 --> 03:15:36.276]  I won't quit.
[03:15:36.576 --> 03:15:37.117]  I won't quit.
[03:15:37.617 --> 03:15:37.977]  Thank you.
[03:15:38.117 --> 03:15:39.278]  We can't quit.
[03:15:39.678 --> 03:15:41.759]  They're not gonna stop, folks.
[03:15:44.521 --> 03:15:45.481]  They're not gonna stop.
[03:15:46.542 --> 03:15:47.783]  We haven't attacked anybody.
[03:15:48.063 --> 03:15:49.764]  They're getting ready to blow stuff up and blame it on us.
[03:15:50.184 --> 03:15:51.205]  Don't attack them.
[03:15:51.625 --> 03:15:53.166]  Don't attack their minions.
[03:15:53.906 --> 03:15:54.807]  That helps them.
[03:15:55.807 --> 03:15:57.148]  Deprogram their minions.
[03:15:57.708 --> 03:15:59.990]  Crystal in Maryland, thanks for holding your on the air.
[03:16:01.325 --> 03:16:03.246]  Hi Alex, I had a quick question.
[03:16:03.266 --> 03:16:26.133]  I'm a federal employee and I'm kind of, I'm really concerned about retirements in this country and I'm thinking about withdrawing my retirement because I feel like the every, you know, the government's about ready to collapse and I wonder if you had any insight on that and I read a while back that Monsanto
[03:16:37.717 --> 03:16:42.018]  Well, I know that federal retirement plans, a lot of them, they're not all invested in one place.
[03:16:42.058 --> 03:16:43.719]  I know Monsanto is involved in it.
[03:16:43.839 --> 03:16:45.500]  I know a bunch of other shady banks are.
[03:16:45.520 --> 03:16:52.302]  And they've already changed the laws bipartisanly in 2005 to, quote, protect your pensions.
[03:16:52.822 --> 03:16:54.983]  They've changed the laws where they can take part of them.
[03:16:55.714 --> 03:16:59.857]  And what they're going to do is take part of them in bites, kind of a bail-in to quote protect them.
[03:17:01.458 --> 03:17:08.342]  And so I am aware of that going on and I was aware of Monsanto being involved in some of the management with some other companies.
[03:17:08.842 --> 03:17:09.282]  So yes.
[03:17:10.463 --> 03:17:19.589]  Okay, I wanted just to thank you for all the information that you're putting out for us and I've been a longtime listener and thank you for trying to wake up America.
[03:17:20.213 --> 03:17:20.953]  Well, thank you, man.
[03:17:20.973 --> 03:17:26.357]  Please don't thank me, though, because it's like thanking somebody for bailing a life raft that's got a hole in it.
[03:17:27.518 --> 03:17:28.939]  I mean, we're all in this together.
[03:17:30.339 --> 03:17:31.280]  But thank you so much.
[03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:31.900]  God bless you.
[03:17:32.461 --> 03:17:33.782]  You could say I've been radicalized.
[03:17:33.802 --> 03:17:35.823]  We're going to skip this network break and go to the bottom of the hour.
[03:17:36.443 --> 03:17:43.608]  You could say I've been radicalized by all the stuff they've done to me and by the things I've seen them do.
[03:17:45.462 --> 03:17:56.609]  They would say, you know, I have PTSD or something from seeing CPS take people's kids for no reason and seeing mothers cry in the court and being physically attacked and being put through the propaganda ringer.
[03:17:56.869 --> 03:17:58.030]  That's not PTSD.
[03:17:58.370 --> 03:18:05.195]  That is becoming hardened to the enemy and disliking them and having a normal dislike of them.
[03:18:06.836 --> 03:18:09.757]  Just like if I caught a rattlesnake in my house, I'm gonna kill it.
[03:18:10.878 --> 03:18:13.480]  That's not some disorder that I have an instinct to want to kill it.
[03:18:15.313 --> 03:18:21.299]  It's the fact that I know what a bunch of nasty scum we're dealing with, and I realize it's only going to get worse.
[03:18:21.539 --> 03:18:25.263]  And I think about all the innocent people they're having their way with, and I'm tired of it.
[03:18:26.204 --> 03:18:27.064]  I'm sick of it.
[03:18:27.365 --> 03:18:28.806]  I'm sick of them always winning.
[03:18:29.507 --> 03:18:33.491]  The average person has had their normal instincts to want to fight tyranny put into football.
[03:18:34.261 --> 03:18:43.066]  To where guys get so excited when their team wins, and they're on cloud nine for a week when they win the Super Bowl, and they feel like they've accomplished something.
[03:18:43.086 --> 03:18:46.108]  I want to see the New World Order fall.
[03:18:46.128 --> 03:18:47.909]  I want to see a better future for humanity.
[03:18:48.409 --> 03:18:50.830]  Not because I'm a good person!
[03:18:52.952 --> 03:18:55.853]  And I'm not saying I'm not a good person, but it's not about me, folks.
[03:18:58.675 --> 03:19:00.856]  You should instinctively hate tyranny.
[03:19:01.356 --> 03:19:03.838]  You should instinctively be disgusted by oppression.
[03:19:04.929 --> 03:19:06.931]  You should instinctively not like bullies.
[03:19:08.412 --> 03:19:23.923]  You should instinctively want to stand up against it, and that's not... I mean, again, I've seen people that stop at car wrecks, or stop when somebody's choking, and everybody thanks them because they do the Heimlich Maneuver, or thanks them because they stop at a car wreck.
[03:19:24.363 --> 03:19:26.945]  What the hell do you expect me to do?
[03:19:28.066 --> 03:19:30.448]  I mean, I want you to help me when I'm in trouble!
[03:19:35.046 --> 03:19:36.828]  We've just become domesticated, folks.
[03:19:36.888 --> 03:19:39.150]  That's why we don't have our normal instincts.
[03:19:39.450 --> 03:19:44.695]  We need to get back to our normal instincts that the system wants to deprogram out of us.
[03:19:47.197 --> 03:19:52.242]  I guarantee you, you go to some Brazilian rainforest tribe and start trying to tell them what to do, they're going to try to kill you.
[03:19:53.503 --> 03:19:56.726]  You go to New Guinea and try to sell some tribe what to do, they're not going to go along with it.
[03:19:57.126 --> 03:20:01.190]  You go anywhere where there's, quote, free people, they're not going to be told what to do by you.
[03:20:03.083 --> 03:20:06.965]  We've been taught it's bizarre to not want to have your lives run by somebody else.
[03:20:09.947 --> 03:20:14.249]  If we had good people trying to run our lives, I'd be against it because it always turns bad.
[03:20:14.549 --> 03:20:16.390]  But we've already gotten to the bad face here.
[03:20:16.950 --> 03:20:18.471]  And now it's getting downright nasty.
[03:20:19.912 --> 03:20:21.372]  I know I just keep repeating the same thing.
[03:20:21.453 --> 03:20:24.574]  I just... Bad people are running the top.
[03:20:25.014 --> 03:20:26.055]  You can't fix it.
[03:20:26.775 --> 03:20:29.797]  The only way to reverse it is to arrest the establishment.
[03:20:30.799 --> 03:20:31.799]  And then you gotta have trials.
[03:20:31.819 --> 03:20:33.039]  But they've all committed crimes.
[03:20:33.540 --> 03:20:34.520]  Show out in the open.
[03:20:38.460 --> 03:20:44.662]  I don't care if they've had government boards sign off on torture and sign off on illegal spying and they've got good reasons for it.
[03:20:44.722 --> 03:20:45.522]  Blah, blah, blah.
[03:20:45.842 --> 03:20:46.222]  Bull.
[03:20:46.842 --> 03:20:47.142]  Bull.
[03:20:49.082 --> 03:20:49.782]  Let's go to your calls.
[03:20:49.802 --> 03:20:53.563]  Let's go to... Marcus in Brazil was able to get back on.
[03:20:54.003 --> 03:20:55.323]  Then we'll go to Robert in Dan.
[03:20:55.964 --> 03:20:57.444]  Go ahead, Marcus in Brazil.
[03:20:57.484 --> 03:20:58.044]  You're on the air.
[03:20:59.529 --> 03:21:00.049]  Hello, Alex.
[03:21:00.450 --> 03:21:02.350]  How are you doing, sir?
[03:21:03.611 --> 03:21:07.913]  First of all, I want to say you do a wonderful work, and I'm a big fan of your work.
[03:21:09.053 --> 03:21:15.596]  Yeah, and people here, when I try to explain to them what's going on in the world, they call me crazy.
[03:21:20.313 --> 03:21:25.382]  Yeah, and I was about to ask you, what do you think of this war on Gaza?
[03:21:25.402 --> 03:21:26.403]  Do you think the U.S.
[03:21:26.463 --> 03:21:31.432]  government is supporting Israel, financing them to keep this war going on?
[03:21:32.267 --> 03:21:41.718]  Yes, and they have a fake tit-for-tat going, where Kerry will criticize Israel, then Israel will say, shut up Obama, to make it look like it's a left-right versus deal.
[03:21:42.739 --> 03:21:44.481]  But it's even more sophisticated than that.
[03:21:44.922 --> 03:21:47.445]  You've got globalist interests trying to stir Gaza up.
[03:21:47.905 --> 03:21:51.769]  Israel blew up the Gaza Strip's power plant today.
[03:21:53.362 --> 03:21:57.385]  Which is a war crime when you're fighting asymmetrical warfare.
[03:21:57.885 --> 03:22:11.854]  And I was against our government bombing Belgrade and Serbia, and blowing up their power plant, and I am against Israel bombing power plants, because that's what supplies men, women, and children with heating and cooling and the hospitals.
[03:22:12.475 --> 03:22:18.499]  And it's against the Geneva Convention, but Israel is not a signatory to that, or the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act.
[03:22:19.445 --> 03:22:20.766]  They're not a signatory to any of it.
[03:22:21.266 --> 03:22:22.207]  And that's their business.
[03:22:22.848 --> 03:22:29.152]  I don't think sovereign countries should have to sign on to stuff, but it is a war crime to bomb a power plant.
[03:22:30.233 --> 03:22:36.518]  Unless the power plant is delivering power directly to an official munitions facility.
[03:22:39.100 --> 03:22:45.945]  Now again, notice Obama is shutting off our power plants with carbon taxes and with regulations, which is an act of war as well.
[03:22:47.870 --> 03:22:49.091]  And it's beyond an act of war.
[03:22:49.411 --> 03:22:50.952]  It is a crime against humanity.
[03:22:53.133 --> 03:22:55.674]  So, I mean, what do you do about Gaza?
[03:22:57.155 --> 03:22:58.675]  I understand it's tribal warfare.
[03:22:58.715 --> 03:23:02.657]  It doesn't look good to have tanks, you know, running over people that are throwing rocks.
[03:23:03.037 --> 03:23:06.359]  I always support, you know, the underdog.
[03:23:07.319 --> 03:23:10.661]  But at the same time, my issue is
[03:23:13.251 --> 03:23:14.932]  Well, I've already told people my issue with Gaza.
[03:23:15.392 --> 03:23:17.514]  I'm concerned about the thousands of civilians killed.
[03:23:19.735 --> 03:23:29.841]  It sticks in my gut what's going on, but at the same time, no one wants to talk about hundreds of thousands killed by ISIS or by Al-Qaeda that our own government's backing.
[03:23:29.881 --> 03:23:34.184]  So you see, it's like I don't automatically obsess on the thing they want me to obsess on.
[03:23:34.384 --> 03:23:35.064]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[03:23:36.165 --> 03:23:36.365]  Yeah.
[03:23:37.226 --> 03:23:38.246]  What do you think about Gaza?
[03:23:40.828 --> 03:23:41.028]  Well,
[03:23:41.807 --> 03:23:45.650]  I think it's the question that I was asking.
[03:23:45.690 --> 03:23:46.471]  I think the U.S.
[03:23:46.511 --> 03:23:47.492]  government is behind us.
[03:23:48.813 --> 03:23:51.135]  Oh, I agree with you.
[03:23:52.056 --> 03:23:55.879]  They're doing this to blame the people from Gaza, the Palestinians.
[03:23:56.820 --> 03:23:59.002]  Oh, you think they're launching false flags?
[03:24:00.063 --> 03:24:00.243]  Yeah.
[03:24:01.257 --> 03:24:06.460]  There have been instances of Israel caught in fake terror attacks before.
[03:24:06.540 --> 03:24:09.802]  That's come out in UPI, AP and Reuters, Jerusalem Post and Haaretz.
[03:24:10.423 --> 03:24:13.144]  So if you've been caught doing it before, you could be a suspect.
[03:24:13.164 --> 03:24:19.809]  The problem is the head of Hamas says we will not coexist with Israel and admits they're shooting the rockets.
[03:24:20.629 --> 03:24:28.611]  So then there's the issue of who's funding Hamas and it is true the same globalists that we talk about are in there funding Hamas.
[03:24:29.051 --> 03:24:36.553]  So then the question is why would Hamas fire rockets giving Israel the pretext to destroy the infrastructure of the Gaza Strip?
[03:24:40.294 --> 03:24:46.816]  Yeah, I think that... Alright, well I appreciate your call from down there in Brazil.
[03:24:48.824 --> 03:24:52.507]  That's one of the few games I watched of World Cup, because I was at a friend's house that happened to be on.
[03:24:52.527 --> 03:24:57.391]  And that's when I remarked, it was like, I like having golf on in the background, even though I don't play a lot of golf.
[03:24:57.731 --> 03:24:59.313]  Grew up playing golf, but never have time to.
[03:25:00.834 --> 03:25:10.582]  And, just like, I kind of like the sound of the field and the birds tweeting, and the announcer only talks a little bit, and the whack of the ball, it like, it doesn't dominate.
[03:25:11.183 --> 03:25:12.764]  It's just something on in the background.
[03:25:13.585 --> 03:25:15.807]  Almost like elevator music that you occasionally look at.
[03:25:17.057 --> 03:25:18.538]  I can watch baseball that way, too.
[03:25:18.558 --> 03:25:19.779]  I used to watch... I like baseball, folks.
[03:25:20.119 --> 03:25:22.001]  I just never watch it anymore because I got more serious stuff to do.
[03:25:22.021 --> 03:25:24.062]  Because it's like, you don't really pay attention to baseball.
[03:25:24.603 --> 03:25:28.506]  It's just kind of, oh, now a pitcher gets up, or this hitter you want to see gets up.
[03:25:28.926 --> 03:25:30.367]  It doesn't dominate your attention.
[03:25:32.549 --> 03:25:35.231]  Like, a good place to have a business meeting is a baseball game.
[03:25:35.491 --> 03:25:37.973]  But I won't go to them because I'm not going to have my genitals grabbed.
[03:25:39.754 --> 03:25:40.675]  That's my protest.
[03:25:41.396 --> 03:25:42.697]  And again, it isn't my God.
[03:25:43.669 --> 03:25:45.430]  Hey Alex, it's nice to talk to you for the first time.
[03:26:09.178 --> 03:26:21.826]  Well, I got an email last night and I get them from like called Town Hall Spotlight and basically the topic is 36 US cities and 20 states dumped the dollar.
[03:26:23.567 --> 03:26:24.108]  And, um.
[03:26:24.924 --> 03:26:40.336]  If you click on it, Warren Buffett's name is in it, and saying people should fear paper money, and then they go on to a video where it says basically people are switching to Edison's renegade currency.
[03:26:42.277 --> 03:26:45.199]  I didn't know if you've heard that or if it's even important.
[03:26:45.980 --> 03:26:52.005]  I'll look it up, but I know Buffett's been betting against the stock market and against the dollar now, and so is that
[03:26:52.773 --> 03:26:55.575]  I mean, Warren Buffett, don't get me started.
[03:27:08.015 --> 03:27:09.276]  Pays almost no taxes.
[03:27:09.316 --> 03:27:11.837]  Helped write the laws in the 90s to do that.
[03:27:12.178 --> 03:27:14.579]  Then gets up on TV and goes, I pay almost no tax.
[03:27:14.979 --> 03:27:16.160]  My secretary pays more.
[03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:17.361]  Raise them on me.
[03:27:18.021 --> 03:27:21.143]  And then the bill that he supports doesn't raise them on him.
[03:27:21.523 --> 03:27:23.585]  It raises it on the middle class and poor people.
[03:27:24.165 --> 03:27:26.587]  Because he wants that money and bailout money to himself.
[03:27:26.967 --> 03:27:28.528]  But he acts like a nice old man.
[03:27:30.427 --> 03:27:32.468]  And so people go, well, he's a nice old man.
[03:27:32.488 --> 03:27:35.268]  And it's just total camouflage.
[03:27:35.689 --> 03:27:36.769]  I'll look into it, Robert.
[03:27:37.509 --> 03:27:38.589]  I appreciate your call.
[03:27:39.290 --> 03:27:41.210]  Dan in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[03:27:41.230 --> 03:27:41.950]  Go ahead.
[03:27:43.211 --> 03:27:43.791]  Hey, Alex.
[03:27:44.471 --> 03:27:45.291]  A couple things.
[03:27:46.152 --> 03:27:47.172]  Yes, we should impeach.
[03:27:47.212 --> 03:27:48.592]  We should impeach Obama.
[03:27:48.953 --> 03:27:51.813]  And the whole thing will begin to unravel after that.
[03:27:51.893 --> 03:27:57.395]  So I'm definitely in support of impeachment right now, regardless of the political consequences.
[03:27:58.095 --> 03:28:00.096]  If somebody just stands up for the truth,
[03:28:01.764 --> 03:28:09.549]  In what we call our government, they're going to be lauded as heroes, and that's what they don't understand, unfortunately.
[03:28:09.569 --> 03:28:21.577]  The second thing about the border situation, and I want to credit Chris Ann Hall for helping me come to this realization about how precious
[03:28:22.532 --> 03:28:36.421]  Liberty really is, and the whole history of the Bill of Rights going back 700 years, and the Great Remonstration, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:28:36.521 --> 03:28:40.303]  Oh yeah, I mean, people think that 1776 was an anti-British thing.
[03:28:40.383 --> 03:28:41.024]  No it wasn't.
[03:28:41.364 --> 03:28:47.328]  It was a continuation of the rebellions that had gone on for hundreds of years in England, and Scotland, and Ireland.
[03:28:48.844 --> 03:28:58.469]  And so that's why I gave a speech there outside London to 4,000 people almost, and they were chanting 1776, a bunch of Brits.
[03:28:59.089 --> 03:29:00.850]  Because they got it and they understood it in the speech.
[03:29:01.990 --> 03:29:03.191]  And that's powerful, folks.
[03:29:03.751 --> 03:29:06.192]  I said 1776 belongs to you.
[03:29:07.473 --> 03:29:09.574]  And then they had Oxford and what's the other big one?
[03:29:10.873 --> 03:29:13.315]  Ox and Cambridge have asked me both to come speak.
[03:29:13.655 --> 03:29:15.376]  I'm not bragging, I just haven't had time to do it.
[03:29:16.357 --> 03:29:19.019]  But I need to set up that British trip, because I like that.
[03:29:19.439 --> 03:29:21.441]  And I'll tell you, they're ready for freedom over there, folks.
[03:29:21.941 --> 03:29:24.923]  And they like the fact that I bypass all that propaganda.
[03:29:25.303 --> 03:29:26.804]  But Dan, very, very interesting.
[03:29:26.844 --> 03:29:27.285]  Anything else?
[03:29:28.678 --> 03:29:29.118]  Uh, yeah.
[03:29:29.499 --> 03:29:34.142]  Um, I would highly recommend that you get Chrisanne Hall on the show.
[03:29:34.162 --> 03:29:42.389]  She was the attorney in Florida who lost her job in 2009 because she refused to kowtow to her boss who told her to stop or lose her job.
[03:29:42.929 --> 03:29:44.931]  And since that time, she's been on a mission.
[03:29:44.951 --> 03:29:46.772]  She travels 265 days a year.
[03:29:46.812 --> 03:29:47.853]  We're looking to getting her on.
[03:29:47.893 --> 03:29:48.934]  Hey, great job with the crew.
[03:29:48.954 --> 03:29:50.375]  That was three and a half hours of radio.
[03:29:50.695 --> 03:29:53.978]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:29:54.538 --> 03:29:55.299]  God bless you all.
[03:29:55.339 --> 03:29:56.620]  We'll see you back tomorrow, Lord willing.
[03:29:58.447 --> 03:30:01.450]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.371 --> 03:30:05.054]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
