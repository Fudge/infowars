[00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:06.947]  That is not what a penis looks like, okay?
[00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:09.430]  It's a clump of cells that's 12 weeks.
[00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:12.192]  It does not look like that!
[00:00:12.272 --> 00:00:13.694]  It's a clump of motherf***ing cells!
[00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:15.315]  No hands are shown for that time!
[00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:19.600]  You're just a white f***ing French racist f***ing male that doesn't stand for women's rights!
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.001]  Get the f*** out of here!
[00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:23.043]  F*** this s***!
[00:00:23.543 --> 00:00:25.365]  And get that camera out of my face, Peter!
[00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:26.166]  F*** what?
[00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:27.727]  Go ahead and call the police.
[00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:28.849]  Riley!
[00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:29.954]  Riley!
[00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:37.041]  For liberals who claim the moral high ground, they sometimes resort to violence and aggression to get their point across.
[00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:43.887]  If that wasn't enough, we've seen videos of peaceful protesters being attacked because of their opposing views.
[00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.141]  Not all attacks are physical, though.
[00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:15.049]  Some of the people who pride themselves on being tolerant will do everything in their power to cost you your job if they disagree with you.
[00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:28.283]  Whether it's a pair of Christian brothers who were dropped from their network because of their pro-life stance, CEOs being forced to resign because of support for traditional merits, or the famous case of the Duck Dynasty controversy,
[00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:32.688]  Standing for your beliefs could mean falling away from public support.
[00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.614]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:46.197]  The facts are in.
[00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:47.497]  The studies are legion.
[00:01:47.797 --> 00:01:55.142]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
