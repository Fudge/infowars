[00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:16.999]  Well, the latest propaganda effort to introduce your children to the new totalitarian society comes by way of Disney.
[00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:24.584]  They've unveiled a new cartoon series where camera-equipped ladybugs spy on kids and then report back to a central authority.
[00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:37.016]  This is Predictive Programming to get your children to accept the coming drone surveillance police state.
[00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:39.957]  We warned you about this way back in 2007.
[00:00:40.657 --> 00:00:48.341]  DARPA researchers were figuring out how to inject computer chips into moth pupa and then hatching them into healthy cyborg moths.
[00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:54.884]  The Hybrid Insect Microelectromechanical Systems Project aims to create literal shutterbugs.
[00:00:55.484 --> 00:01:03.146]  Camera-toting insects whose nerves have grown into their internal silicone chip so that wranglers can control their activities.
[00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:06.847]  Unfortunately, the coming drones won't be friendly little ladybugs.
[00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:13.708]  They'll be swarms of killer suicide drones intent on killing anyone who doesn't surrender power to the state.
[00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:21.890]  Unobtrusive, pervasive, lethal, micro air vehicles enhancing the capabilities of the future warfighter.
[00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:22.582]  The U.S.
[00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:32.565]  Air Force is developing tiny unmanned drones that will fly in swarms, crawl like spiders, and even sneak up on unsuspecting targets and execute them with lethal precision.
[00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:38.307]  Disney's Shutterbug isn't the only cartoon that's out there acclimating your children to this dystopic future.
[00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:43.388]  The TSA's rolled out their own indoctrination cartoon, Stop Screen Go.
[00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:55.870]  The agency that was set up to purposely obstruct, harass and train the American public will now condition your children to be compliant with their invasive pat-downs and wholly ineffective nude body scanners.
[00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.792]  And Disney's also showing that being perpetually tracked via biometrics is just part of another day at the happiest place on Earth.
[00:02:04.352 --> 00:02:08.935]  The CIA-connected company has moved beyond just fingerprint scanners at the front gate.
[00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:12.677]  Now they have the MagicBand RFID bracelet.
[00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:18.180]  It tracks you through your entire trip, working as a door key, a ticket, and a credit card.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.085]  But most frightening, it creates an online profile for each family member that can be accessed by the costumed characters.
[00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:38.341]  So if you were concerned before about your kids talking to strangers, just wait till you find out that Mickey is actually a middle-aged man with no background check who now has access to their name and birth date.
