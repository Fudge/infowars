[00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:02.967]  So what is this for?
[00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:05.428]  What do you got?
[00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.730]  What is this for?
[00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:14.734]  This is basically a rolling, like a shield for us, for a team to hide behind.
[00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:15.835]  It's bulletproof.
[00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:18.877]  What situation would you be in that you would need to pull this out?
[00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:21.479]  We have guys that shoot at police officers.
[00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.141]  So like they have AK-47s or automatic weapons.
[00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:31.041]  And they shoot at us, and this is like a rolling, we can use this as a shield to move the team.
[00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:33.944]  So what do you call that kind of a vehicle?
[00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:35.947]  This is a MRAP, they call it.
[00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:37.008]  MRAP, wow.
[00:00:37.188 --> 00:00:42.974]  So it's a military surplus vehicle, military you run away from.
[00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:47.375]  But now the police, local police, are using it for rioters or things like that.
[00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:48.095]  Like Black Friday.
[00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:49.036]  You just had Black Friday.
[00:00:49.056 --> 00:00:50.016]  That could have been a situation.
[00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:52.656]  Basically, it's cover for our team movements.
[00:00:53.357 --> 00:00:54.197]  It's bulletproof.
[00:00:54.497 --> 00:00:58.038]  There's a lot of people out there with heavy machine guns and heavy weapons.
[00:00:58.118 --> 00:00:59.398]  And we use it.
[00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:00.899]  It's bulletproof.
[00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:02.139]  So we can use it as a shield.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.452]  And I know there's a lot of people concerned in that the military turning on our own citizens in case there were some event that would trigger that.
[00:01:12.632 --> 00:01:13.313]  What do you guys think?
[00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:15.999]  How do you guys feel about that?
[00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:23.723]  Constitutionally, Obama's just kind of stepping all over anything constitutional right now, so I think people are really afraid of their government right now.
[00:01:23.743 --> 00:01:29.806]  And then when you see this kind of a vehicle on, I mean, it seems like this is a campaign, right?
[00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:32.347]  All these police officers out in front of Walmart?
[00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:35.349]  It's not a campaign, we're doing, uh, we're shopping for children.
[00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:36.609]  Oh, you are!
[00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.970]  Okay, so there's something else.
[00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.770]  Okay, okay.
[00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:41.632]  Oh sure, sure.
[00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:46.776]  But you know, from a parent, from a citizen... The kids love to see this stuff for the small team.
[00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:47.477]  Sure, sure.
[00:01:47.497 --> 00:01:49.198]  Yeah, well my son would too.
[00:01:49.578 --> 00:02:02.029]  But then as a citizen and someone who's raising children in a world that I don't know what it's going to look like with them, I feel like this is also kind of a desensitization type of tool where they're going to think it's normal.
[00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:08.114]  You know, a lot of kids grow up and AK-47s in the hands of people policing them while they're going to school is normal.
[00:02:08.134 --> 00:02:09.135]  Times are crazy right now.
[00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:10.175]  Yeah.
[00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:10.755]  It's crazy right now.
[00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:11.596]  Everything changed.
[00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:27.262]  Everything's going crazy, so... I mean, I know you guys are on the front line and you need to be protected, but we're... I know there's a lot of people worried about that turning on citizens who are deemed to be, you know, terrorists, and that is a very loose term now.
[00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:28.243]  Who is a terrorist?
[00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:29.083]  That's worldwide.
[00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:30.344]  It's just everywhere.
[00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:48.904]  Well, the nice thing about this piece of equipment is that if somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in, they can pull right up to a front line and take enemy fire and still try to address a threat without being afraid of getting shot.
[00:02:49.184 --> 00:02:53.827]  So I'm thinking that is totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:54.867]  would you see that happening?
[00:02:54.927 --> 00:02:58.930]  I mean we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.311]  A lot of ammunition.
[00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:05.934]  I mean we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:07.635]  A lot of ammunition.
[00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:08.996]  They have weapons here locally.
[00:03:11.513 --> 00:03:13.175]  Do you think that's their right to have those?
[00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:16.658]  Or do you think that that's inappropriate?
[00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:18.680]  Those people don't always turn on their government.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.425]  They don't turn on the cops unless there's, you know, I guess reason, they think, to do that.
[00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:25.446]  And some of them are pretty in crazy land.
[00:03:25.647 --> 00:03:26.087]  Some of them.
[00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:27.288]  It's worldwide.
[00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:28.529]  The world's in a stable right now.
[00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.151]  You look anywhere.
[00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:31.032]  You watch the news.
[00:03:31.112 --> 00:03:33.034]  You watch Open Borders.
[00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:33.995]  I know.
[00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:36.397]  You know, I mean, we could have this debate.
[00:03:37.338 --> 00:03:39.901]  I mean, we could all sit here and talk about it all day long.
[00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:41.903]  Our thing is here to look for the kids today.
[00:03:41.943 --> 00:03:42.283]  Right.
[00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:43.664]  You know, we're showing them our equipment.
[00:03:43.684 --> 00:03:45.026]  We're not making it a mystery.
[00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:46.407]  It's not a... Yeah.
[00:03:46.447 --> 00:03:47.889]  We get officers that are pinned down.
[00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.812]  This is a great rescue vehicle to get them out of a situation.
[00:03:51.372 --> 00:03:51.472]  Sure.
[00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:53.674]  I mean, there's been so much on the news.
[00:03:54.685 --> 00:04:00.248]  So up there, is that where, um, basically you can attach some type of, uh, of a automatic weapon?
[00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:02.050]  Those are lifting points for a crane.
[00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.490]  Oh, okay.
[00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.991]  You can lift the body off of it.
[00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:06.973]  If they had to do some work on it or something, those are lifting points.
[00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:08.013]  Okay.
[00:04:09.714 --> 00:04:12.196]  Or dropping points with a helicopter.
[00:04:12.216 --> 00:04:13.116]  You had to drop in.
[00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:15.438]  We have a helicopter.
[00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:17.099]  Our helicopter's small.
[00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:18.660]  Okay, wouldn't pick this up.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.541]  You can barely fit three guys in it.
[00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:20.781]  Oh.
[00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:27.324]  And it actually had a rounded area, so if you actually were to get up top, that part has actually been removed from there.
[00:04:27.364 --> 00:04:29.925]  But it could be replaced.
[00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:31.486]  Could a turret be put back on that?
[00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:33.227]  I suppose you could, if we don't have one.
[00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:34.788]  If that makes sense.
[00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:35.768]  You don't have one yet?
[00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:37.909]  No, we got rid of it because we don't use it.
[00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.810]  We don't use it for that purpose.
[00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.732]  But if there was ever a need that someone said you needed to now use it, you could replace it up there?
[00:04:44.372 --> 00:04:47.616]  I suppose you could mount whatever you wanted on it, but I mean that's not the purpose.
[00:04:48.658 --> 00:04:49.078]  Okay.
[00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.859]  Yeah.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.426]  Yeah, I mean this highly concerns me because as a citizen I'm thinking, why do you need this kind of a vehicle on US soil?
[00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:56.167]  To rescue people.
[00:04:56.207 --> 00:04:59.031]  And putting it out in front of a Walmart to desensitize children.
[00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:02.375]  If this is okay to be in a world growing up with, you're gonna see these more often.
