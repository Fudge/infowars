[00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:11.361]  I think we're getting swatted.
[00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:12.102]  What in the world?
[00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:16.605]  Put your hands up!
[00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:19.428]  Put your hands up!
[00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:21.730]  Get on the ground!
[00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.631]  Get on the ground now!
[00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:23.711]  Get on the f***ing ground!
[00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:25.833]  Put your hands behind your back!
[00:00:25.853 --> 00:00:26.854]  Put your hands behind your back now!
[00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:28.135]  David A, we got one accustomed.
[00:00:34.554 --> 00:00:43.039]  That was video of Colorado police raiding an online gamer on a fake emergency call, swatting, a dangerous prank that some gamers play on each other.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:52.866]  And I understand that the police need to take these situations seriously, but putting a boot in the back of an unarmed man who voluntarily surrendered is a bit overkill in my humble opinion.
[00:00:53.406 --> 00:01:00.771]  Just like it's overkill in Ferguson, Missouri to put sniper dots on unarmed protesters who are a conservative 50 yards away from the police.
[00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:11.880]  If in their need to protect themselves, the police brutalized the general populace, who exactly are they protecting and serving?
[00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:26.993]  We've even seen a police chief in Florida say that his officer was justified in threatening to kill a suspect because the suspect didn't show the proper amount of fear.
[00:01:27.413 --> 00:01:29.615]  Which is to say he wants you to be afraid of the police,
[00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:35.841]  But if you run from the police, just like you'd run from anybody with a gun who was intimidating you, then you're breaking the law.
[00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:39.385]  But it does seem that our country is at a potential turning point.
[00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:48.414]  After the spectacle of force in Ferguson, Missouri, police departments and sheriff's departments are realizing that mind-resistant vehicles aren't necessary for everyday policing.
[00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:49.435]  And I say, great!
[00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:51.998]  Call the Pentagon and tell them to come pick these things up.
[00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:52.938]  That's where you got them from.
[00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:00.742]  But don't just ditch the vehicles, also ditch the federalized training that teaches you to react to your general population as enemy combatants.
[00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:06.204]  We need many less people interested in law enforcement and many more people interested in keeping the peace.
