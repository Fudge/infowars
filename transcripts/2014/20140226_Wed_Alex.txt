[00:00:01.231 --> 00:00:01.872]  Big Brother.
[00:00:02.534 --> 00:00:03.576]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:04.317 --> 00:00:05.419]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.882]  You want answers?
[00:00:07.683 --> 00:00:08.505]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:08.565]  He...
[00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.910]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.611]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.451]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:20.911]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:22.592]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:26.853]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.494]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:56.524]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, the 26th day of February 2014.
[00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:00.368]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:02.430]  We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:07.195]  And boy, do we have some very informative guests joining us today.
[00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:13.107]  We've got Art Acevedo, the Austin Police Chief, who's been set up for two weeks to come on today.
[00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:23.293]  He's in the middle of international controversy in foreign newspapers, national papers, you name it, for saying, hey, at least Austin police don't rape and shoot and torture people.
[00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:31.196]  Which actually is a statement I've made, that as bad as some of the Austin police are, they're better than most cities I've been to.
[00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:33.938]  He said that in an off-the-cuff remark.
[00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:40.418]  And I've actually said that to him in studio before, and now it's a big deal.
[00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:46.823]  But the reason I've got him coming on is to talk about the federalization of law enforcement, where he stands on the Second Amendment, and more.
[00:01:47.283 --> 00:01:52.026]  Mike Adams is going to be popping in on his article from naturalnews.com that's up on infowars.com.
[00:01:52.647 --> 00:01:59.731]  Google robots, Kurzweil's AI, and why self-aware machines will inevitably seek to destroy humanity, he's going to be popping in.
[00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:01.452]  And Chris Driscoll,
[00:02:02.293 --> 00:02:05.658]  The gentleman that was wearing a pro-Second Amendment shirt got thrown out of a voting booth.
[00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.201]  That story made national news.
[00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:08.062]  We broke it last week.
[00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:10.065]  That is coming up as well.
[00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:12.850]  By the way, he reached out to us and we're excited about it.
[00:02:14.332 --> 00:02:15.474]  Tucker Carlson!
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.441]  of the Daily Caller and Fox News is going to be in studio in the first hour Friday.
[00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:30.623]  That's the only hour he can do it, but he'll be in studio with us for a lively discussion and debate about the future of Libertarianism, Republican Party and more.
[00:02:30.643 --> 00:02:39.725]  So I think it'll be a friendly discussion but slash debate with Tucker Carlson coming up in studio Friday when he's here in Austin.
[00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:42.847]  Where we broadcast from, obviously.
[00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:44.269]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.112]  And we have some really special guests tomorrow.
[00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:56.042]  Tomorrow, we have the retired state police officer from Connecticut who's been investigating Sandy Hook and being threatened and harassed.
[00:02:56.963 --> 00:02:58.525]  Clearly, Sandy Hook is staged.
[00:02:59.966 --> 00:03:01.508]  We don't know exactly what happened.
[00:03:01.528 --> 00:03:02.069]  I want to be clear.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:13.184]  It's kind of like if the cops know you're lying about something and they know your story doesn't fit, and they know you're involved somehow, and they know your official story isn't true, they still don't know what exactly went on, you understand?
[00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:19.606]  But we're going to be talking to school shooting expert threatened over Sandy Hook investigation.
[00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:23.967]  Was told to back off if bad things are going to happen to him.
[00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:34.476]  Wolfgang Halbig is going to be joining us tomorrow for a full hour to be talking about what's happening with that situation.
[00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:38.000]  I believe they killed real kids.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.341]  We know they were having a drill.
[00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.985]  We know they had actors that came out and put out the official story and got caught acting.
[00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.573]  We've got footage of the known CIA operative, Anderson Cooper, with a green screen, blue screen, with his nose disappearing.
[00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:59.215]  And you can see a loop of footage shot there at the Square in Connecticut, there in Sandy Hook.
[00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:03.096]  And you see bags blowing, and the bag blows the same way again.
[00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:04.737]  I mean, it's a loop, folks.
[00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:08.118]  So, something's going on.
[00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:12.820]  And they caught a Homeland Security federalized cop
[00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:24.547]  They caught a Homeland Security federalized cop in the same black top, camo pants, was arrested minutes after the whole thing started when local police showed up.
[00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:27.008]  And then they said, oh, we never stopped anybody.
[00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:28.549]  It's made up, even though there's helicopter footage.
[00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:29.709]  They later had to admit it.
[00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:30.569]  So there's a cover up there.
[00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.230]  All the signs are there.
[00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:35.232]  All the signs are there that it was a drill.
[00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.916]  And we don't know what else happened there, but it was all staged to get our guns, we know that.
[00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:41.719]  And so that's coming up tomorrow.
[00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:44.704]  I just wanted to let you know about that because it's very important.
[00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:51.026]  Now, when we come back, gold rises a 17-week high on signs of U.S.
[00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:51.887]  economy sputtering.
[00:04:52.347 --> 00:04:52.967]  That's Bloomberg.
[00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:57.550]  Putin orders combat readiness test for Western Central Russian troops.
[00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.091]  And the big one.
[00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:06.935]  We told you the IRS is coming for your bank account, and to garnish your wages, and to take your tax refund for Obamacare.
[00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:09.237]  Of course, Obama promised you that wouldn't happen.
[00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:17.309]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
[00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.072]  A practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:23.273]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:05:23.453 --> 00:05:24.154]  Fluoride!
[00:05:24.354 --> 00:05:25.935]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:32.600]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.682]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.643]  And the results are on record.
[00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:38.764]  Reports documented.
[00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:43.868]  In areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:05:44.068 --> 00:05:46.249]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.130]  Unbound.
[00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.831]  Clean.
[00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:49.132]  In a glycerin base.
[00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:52.795]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:58.159]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:03.183]  InfoWarsLife Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:13.120]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.246]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:07:18.426 --> 00:07:25.594]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:07:25.714 --> 00:07:31.118]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:07.849]  Are you?
[00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:08.890]  Infowarshop.com
[00:08:12.518 --> 00:08:13.579]  What's his name?
[00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:36.268]  There is a war.
[00:08:36.708 --> 00:08:37.709]  It's happening now.
[00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.330]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:42.672]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:08:43.432 --> 00:08:44.913]  We are the Resistance.
[00:08:45.334 --> 00:08:46.895]  We are the Infowar.
[00:08:51.517 --> 00:08:55.299]  It is Wednesday, the 26th day of February, 2014.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:02.704]  The embattled Austin police chief, Arte Cerveda, is scheduled to be in studio.
[00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:15.251]  He's made international headlines in the last week with statements after the police tackled and arrested a woman who was jogging, wearing earbuds, listening to music, and did not hear their command to stop.
[00:09:16.012 --> 00:09:18.213]  And he said, hey, she's lucky she didn't get raped.
[00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:21.209]  Like other police departments would do.
[00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.215]  And then he gave examples of police raping women.
[00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:27.560]  And I guess it really is a real argument.
[00:09:29.562 --> 00:09:38.749]  As sneaky and slick as Arte Saavedra is, he does have the will to come in on air and argue with me and debate, and he does say off-the-cuff things that I actually agree with.
[00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:46.156]  I mean, it shows how much trouble this country is in that we ought to be glad they're just not raping people like some other big police departments are.
[00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:50.559]  But that's not why I've got him coming on, but we'll raise that issue with him at the bottom.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.862]  of the third hour.
[00:09:54.342 --> 00:10:10.856]  By the way, one of my friends went out to eat in downtown last week and about 10 o'clock at night was leaving after the business meeting and he got pulled over with him and his buddy and both of them are not, one of them hardly drinks, the other person hasn't had anything to drink in 17 years, he's proud of that.
[00:10:11.803 --> 00:10:13.864]  And the cop screams at him, get out of the car.
[00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:15.225]  He's like, well, what have I done?
[00:10:15.265 --> 00:10:20.949]  Well, just get out of the car and you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna breathe in this breathalyzer using force, using threat.
[00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.891]  Okay, I'll breathe in the breathalyzer.
[00:10:23.711 --> 00:10:25.072]  And then no alcohol found.
[00:10:25.152 --> 00:10:28.274]  So the other guy says, I haven't had anything to drink in 17 years.
[00:10:28.314 --> 00:10:29.875]  He screams at him and says, I don't believe you.
[00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:30.536]  Shut up, liar.
[00:10:30.556 --> 00:10:32.737]  And that all goes on.
[00:10:33.038 --> 00:10:39.302]  And he said the cop looked like he was about 19 years old and was just screaming at him the whole time.
[00:10:42.103 --> 00:10:44.605]  And I just don't know if I can handle this anymore.
[00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:47.967]  In a so-called free country being treated like that.
[00:10:48.287 --> 00:10:59.395]  Now most Austin police do not act like that and I know we're a nationwide radio show, it's just that more and more it's like we're in Fallujah and I'm an Al-Qaeda operative is the way I'm being treated or something.
[00:11:00.275 --> 00:11:02.857]  Like I'm a terrorist and I've just quite frankly had enough of it.
[00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.338]  But that's coming up.
[00:11:04.358 --> 00:11:08.781]  We're going to have open phones obviously today and cover a ton of news.
[00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:11.023]  Rand Paul
[00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:15.936]  is the GOP's early presidential frontrunner.
[00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:23.399]  While the establishment hopes for a governor to emerge, he is quietly putting together a formidable operation.
[00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:30.601]  Rand Paul and, of course, Ted Cruz are libertarian conservatives and are the guys that helped beat the gun grab in the Senate.
[00:11:31.061 --> 00:11:33.342]  People could say, oh, they're not perfect on this or that.
[00:11:34.022 --> 00:11:36.203]  They're light years better than Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:36.743 --> 00:11:38.824]  They're light years better than Chuckie Schumer.
[00:11:39.484 --> 00:11:42.105]  They're light years better than Harry Reid and Barack Obama.
[00:11:43.226 --> 00:11:46.627]  And they have ideas that will help get this country back on track.
[00:11:46.947 --> 00:12:04.873]  And it shows how awake this country is, that just three years ago, Rand Paul was seen as a radical, and as a long shot, and the Republican establishment lined up to try to beat him in the primaries in Kentucky, and the Democrats lined up against him, big business lined up against him, but it failed.
[00:12:05.714 --> 00:12:10.755]  And it's an example of how a libertarian constitutionalist can take over the Republican Party.
[00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:18.577]  Now, just two months ago, Ted Cruz was the frontrunner in polls and with money to be able to run for president.
[00:12:19.237 --> 00:12:28.019]  But Rand Paul started getting more hardcore and saying, why is Bill Clinton raising money when he's a known serial rapist, sexual predator?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.360]  Why
[00:12:31.767 --> 00:12:35.769]  Is the system and feminists not going after this guy?
[00:12:35.849 --> 00:12:40.970]  And Rand Paul is back in the news today in CBS News.
[00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:47.273]  Rand Paul, Democrats should be embarrassed to be seen with Bill Clinton.
[00:12:48.177 --> 00:12:48.617]  Exactly.
[00:12:48.677 --> 00:13:04.350]  He's calling out the shame of these people, and that's how you win, is calling the other side out on Benghazi, on Fashion Furious, on Solyndra, on shutting down our power plants, on Obama acting like a dictator, on Obamacare.
[00:13:04.831 --> 00:13:09.394]  But you don't see any of the Republican bluebloods doing any of this, do you?
[00:13:11.196 --> 00:13:11.596]  Zero.
[00:13:12.377 --> 00:13:14.999]  All you see them doing is running around like
[00:13:16.311 --> 00:13:22.613]  Tasmanian devils with their heads cut off, chickens with their heads cut off, trying to beat the Tea Party.
[00:13:23.013 --> 00:13:25.654]  Because the globalists have already conquered this nation.
[00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:28.035]  They've already conquered us through fraud.
[00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:29.716]  Illegitimately.
[00:13:29.956 --> 00:13:40.200]  And so now they've just got to have the illusion of choice between Republican and Democrat, but if the Tea Party comes in and takes over, well then there's actually a second party in this country and there's a choice
[00:13:41.505 --> 00:13:49.767]  And people will realize there's hope, and they will get behind good candidates, and then the process can be reversed, we can start going back on the path of prosperity.
[00:13:50.287 --> 00:14:01.049]  Because I don't care how much power the globalists have, once they've been identified, once they've been exposed as scamsters and fraudsters and basically kleptocrats, it's game over.
[00:14:02.989 --> 00:14:11.111]  And we have the tools, right now, ladies and gentlemen, to absolutely bring this corrupt oligarchy down.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.923]  But we have to get aggressive if we've got any hope of ever doing that.
[00:14:21.683 --> 00:14:23.984]  Okay, let's get into some of the news here.
[00:14:24.424 --> 00:14:25.685]  I just mentioned this.
[00:14:27.385 --> 00:14:32.308]  IRS warns Obamacare tax must be paid with tax return.
[00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:42.592]  Agency employs Orwellian term shared responsibility payment to describe Obamacare individual tax mandate.
[00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:55.482]  And they go on on the IRS website to say that you will be made to pay it and to report on yourself in your tax return and that they're going to come for your money.
[00:14:56.442 --> 00:15:09.950]  The term shared tax responsibility payment refers to Obamacare individual mandate tax, one of at least seven tax hikes in the Obamacare law that directly hit families making less than $250,000 per year.
[00:15:14.742 --> 00:15:21.748]  And of course they're talking about garnishing wages, not sending tax refunds, and grabbing money out of bank accounts.
[00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:32.358]  The IRS goes on to say if you've not paid the $5,000 fine, or gotten the so-called health care, you may owe a shared responsibility payment when you file in 2015.
[00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:32.959]  Did you hear that?
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.201]  They're going to call it the Shared Responsibility Payment, and the IRS is going to collect.
[00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:42.903]  It's like when they hired 17,000 new IRS agents in the bill.
[00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:45.704]  They went, no, we're not going to tax you.
[00:15:46.324 --> 00:15:47.824]  The IRS isn't going to take that money.
[00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:51.345]  I mean, it's in the bill, and it's a law, but we're not going to.
[00:15:51.365 --> 00:15:53.246]  Now let the bill pass.
[00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:56.666]  Yeah, shut up racist.
[00:15:57.706 --> 00:15:59.908]  Everybody knows they're not going to tax this liar.
[00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:01.469]  Well, it's in the bill.
[00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:05.351]  You need to shut up, tea bagger.
[00:16:09.293 --> 00:16:12.415]  And now we see it all unfolding from the IRS's own website.
[00:16:13.615 --> 00:16:17.398]  And meanwhile, Obama is running around going, oh, I'm going to waive it for a year.
[00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:20.079]  I'm going to... only for big corporations, not for individuals.
[00:16:20.539 --> 00:16:23.101]  I mean, it is a giant screw job, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:24.102 --> 00:16:25.602]  And they're getting away with it, so why not?
[00:16:26.143 --> 00:16:32.384]  Next, they're going to take your bank accounts, your 401Ks, your IRAs, and take a large percentage of it, nationalizing it.
[00:16:32.404 --> 00:16:33.965]  That's all being announced, already being done in Europe.
[00:16:34.945 --> 00:16:41.726]  Bail-ins, they're going to take large slices of your bank account money and threaten that the stock market's going to tank if you don't.
[00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:43.707]  That's how they hold you hostage.
[00:16:43.767 --> 00:16:47.328]  It's the same program over and over and over again.
[00:16:48.635 --> 00:16:53.059]  And they're placing more and more capital controls on cash and other systems.
[00:16:53.599 --> 00:16:54.980]  Here's a Washington Post article.
[00:16:55.821 --> 00:16:57.802]  Obama administration health law.
[00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:02.586]  Health law's new rules will increase costs for most small businesses.
[00:17:02.606 --> 00:17:05.389]  Yes, it will make people cut hours and lay folks off.
[00:17:05.409 --> 00:17:07.731]  But hey, it can always go on welfare.
[00:17:09.432 --> 00:17:11.674]  And Breitbart reports perpetual amnesty
[00:17:13.812 --> 00:17:23.000]  Minors illegally crossing Texas border on the rise because their parents can then be brought in under the new amnesty law that Obama is implementing by fiat.
[00:17:25.302 --> 00:17:27.544]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[00:17:27.624 --> 00:17:37.453]  Continuing here today, gold rises to 17 week high on signs of US economy sputters.
[00:17:39.008 --> 00:17:40.669]  Well, it's on the weakening dollar.
[00:17:40.969 --> 00:17:42.930]  That's why they artificially keep gold down.
[00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:48.933]  That even came out in the Financial Times of London two days ago in a big report that they then pulled today, two days later.
[00:17:49.993 --> 00:17:50.774]  Didn't retract it.
[00:17:51.114 --> 00:17:51.994]  Didn't say it was wrong.
[00:17:52.535 --> 00:17:53.675]  Just deep-sixed it.
[00:17:53.715 --> 00:17:59.098]  Zero Hedge is reporting on that right now, and that's also up on InfoWars.com.
[00:18:01.223 --> 00:18:09.438]  Continuing here, gold futures climbed to the highest in almost 17 weeks on speculation that a sputtering U.S.
[00:18:09.478 --> 00:18:13.586]  economy will boost demand for the metal as an alternative investment.
[00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:16.967]  U.S.
[00:18:16.987 --> 00:18:25.212]  consumer confidence fell more than forecast in February from January, an index from the New York-based Conference Board showed today.
[00:18:25.232 --> 00:18:31.697]  Home prices rose at a slower pace in the 12 months that ended in December, according to a separate report.
[00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:37.900]  Russia's Deputy Finance Minister said Ukraine faces a high chance of defaulting on its sovereign debt.
[00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:39.942]  Gold has gained 12 percent this year.
[00:18:41.135 --> 00:18:42.136]  Told you that was coming.
[00:18:43.177 --> 00:18:44.959]  They can only artificially suppress it so long.
[00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:48.362]  Here's a big report up on InfoWars.com from last night.
[00:18:48.942 --> 00:18:57.710]  And I'm going to ask Don and Kit to put this back in the tiles on the front page of PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com because it's a big deal.
[00:18:58.291 --> 00:18:59.972]  We told you this was coming in Connecticut.
[00:19:00.493 --> 00:19:05.638]  Surrender your firearms, Connecticut tells unregistered gun owners.
[00:19:06.718 --> 00:19:07.158]  That's right.
[00:19:09.219 --> 00:19:13.162]  New York is banning anything over 10 rounds and SWAT teaming people.
[00:19:13.622 --> 00:19:18.104]  State orders owners of newly banned unregistered firearms to turn them all in.
[00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:26.449]  State of Connecticut is now demanding that gun owners across the state turn in all newly banned unregistered firearms and magazines or face felony arrest.
[00:19:26.889 --> 00:19:40.797]  The State Police Special Licensing and Firearms Unit began mailing out notices to gun owners who attempted to register their firearms and accessories with the state, but did not do so in time for the January 1st deadline of Connecticut's newly enacted gun law.
[00:19:41.718 --> 00:19:42.938]  Their answer is turn them in.
[00:19:43.739 --> 00:19:48.542]  The law bans the sale of magazines holding over 10 rounds, assault rifles as anything semi-automatic,
[00:19:49.935 --> 00:19:59.181]  We are returning your application for assault rifle certificate, large capacity magazine declaration because it is not received or postmarked prior to January 1st, 2014.
[00:19:59.261 --> 00:20:01.903]  It was required by law, so there you go.
[00:20:02.283 --> 00:20:05.506]  It wasn't just registered to them, it was actually a confiscation law.
[00:20:06.186 --> 00:20:08.247]  90-plus percent were unable to register.
[00:20:08.447 --> 00:20:09.788]  The SWAT teams are coming.
[00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:13.010]  Huge Mountain House sale at Emergency Essentials.

[00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:11.169]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:16.314]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:23:16.575 --> 00:23:24.382]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:24.662 --> 00:23:28.987]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:33.052]  By Patriots Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:33.172 --> 00:23:38.898]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:39.138 --> 00:23:39.579]  It is rare to
[00:23:39.599 --> 00:23:40.019]  We're good.
[00:24:27.935 --> 00:24:28.415]  Hey, guys.
[00:24:29.536 --> 00:24:32.417]  Pull up that Zero Hedge article that has the screenshot of the Financial Times.
[00:24:32.917 --> 00:24:33.858]  Deep-sixing that story.
[00:24:33.878 --> 00:24:35.078]  I want to get into that.
[00:24:35.278 --> 00:24:35.518]  Thanks.
[00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:38.400]  Yeah, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.481]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday edition.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:52.089]  Imagine Connecticut where they tell you you gotta go register all your semi-autos and your magazines and clips and then the government offices weren't open long enough, people were unable to do it.
[00:24:52.109 --> 00:24:54.591]  A lot of folks just didn't do it because it's unconstitutional.
[00:24:55.292 --> 00:24:58.294]  And now the state police are sending them letters saying we're getting ready to come arrest you.
[00:24:58.915 --> 00:25:01.657]  You're not allowed to register it now, you just gotta turn them all in.
[00:25:03.078 --> 00:25:06.521]  Law-abiding citizens, this is an illegitimate government.
[00:25:08.024 --> 00:25:13.187]  More and more, and we're not saying the average person that works for the system is a bad person.
[00:25:13.227 --> 00:25:17.989]  We don't want to be your enemy, but you've got to stop following these unconstitutional orders.
[00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.771]  The American people have got to stop following it.
[00:25:21.071 --> 00:25:22.252]  You've got election fraud.
[00:25:22.292 --> 00:25:24.113]  You've got all sorts of criminality going on.
[00:25:24.533 --> 00:25:31.837]  You've got illegals allowed to vote all over the country and being given driver's license while citizens are harassed.
[00:25:31.877 --> 00:25:37.000]  I mean, it's unprecedented how you're penalized if you try to work in the system
[00:25:38.311 --> 00:25:39.712]  And do what you're told in this country.
[00:25:40.832 --> 00:25:42.513]  And it's getting worse and worse by the day.
[00:25:43.394 --> 00:25:47.576]  Now, speaking of things being rigged, it came out with LIBOR internationally, their rigging interest rates.
[00:25:47.596 --> 00:25:54.300]  A few years ago, even Rolling Stone had a cover story about everything is rigged, was the headline.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.503]  All the major IRAs, all the major stocks, all the major derivative funds.
[00:26:01.064 --> 00:26:01.905]  It's rigged, folks.
[00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:04.649]  For insiders to be able to take over.
[00:26:04.709 --> 00:26:05.309]  There's the headline.
[00:26:05.349 --> 00:26:06.110]  Everything is rigged.
[00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.210]  The biggest price fixing scandal ever.
[00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:14.091]  And that means that select insiders get to take over all the markets.
[00:26:14.131 --> 00:26:20.732]  Not because of productivity, not because of quality, not because of competition, but because their combine is in control.
[00:26:21.612 --> 00:26:23.693]  This is what the right wing won't explain to you.
[00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:26.053]  They say all corporations are perfect and are good.
[00:26:26.473 --> 00:26:29.514]  The left says all corporations are bad, only government is good.
[00:26:30.353 --> 00:26:41.255]  When it's a fascist model, a corporatist model on top, a fascist model on top with socialism on the bottom as a tool of domestication and control.
[00:26:42.235 --> 00:26:44.196]  This is the type of issue we're talking about here.
[00:26:46.436 --> 00:26:53.637]  And it's not my opinion that we've had world currency devaluations, especially in the dollar, in the last 30 years.
[00:26:53.657 --> 00:26:56.178]  I mean, when I started promoting gold in 1996, it was
[00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.611]  $300 an ounce or less.
[00:27:01.911 --> 00:27:02.791]  It peaked almost at $2,000.
[00:27:03.952 --> 00:27:06.073]  I didn't sell one piece of gold or silver I bought.
[00:27:06.473 --> 00:27:07.053]  Silver went up to $50.
[00:27:07.733 --> 00:27:08.273]  Went back down to $20.
[00:27:09.114 --> 00:27:10.314]  I didn't sell a single piece of it.
[00:27:12.075 --> 00:27:18.417]  Because I fundamentally know that they're devaluing paper across the board.
[00:27:18.897 --> 00:27:20.738]  All sorts of financial instruments in a bubble.
[00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:24.860]  And in the final equation, gold and silver and platinum and palladium
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:34.145]  And copper and so many other commodities traded on the open mercantile exchange are going to go up.
[00:27:35.006 --> 00:27:38.288]  And the elites, universities, governments, they're all hoarding it as well.
[00:27:39.368 --> 00:27:51.096]  They're net sellers of paper gold to short the market, make it short it, but they're overall hoarders and massive owners of the metals physically.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.681]  Now, let's get into Bloomberg.
[00:27:53.761 --> 00:27:57.043]  Gold rises to 17-week high on signs U.S.
[00:27:57.083 --> 00:27:57.883]  economy sputters.
[00:27:59.464 --> 00:28:08.189]  The Consumer Confidence Index, home prices, all of it points towards the Federal Reserve cutting and we're really in a slump in 2013.
[00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:10.410]  We've been in a slump since 2008.
[00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.591]  Now, let's continue here.
[00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:15.252]  Here is the Financial Times of London.
[00:28:15.292 --> 00:28:17.514]  Zero Hedge was able to save it.
[00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:22.071]  Here is the Financial Times Gold Price Manipulation article that was removed.
[00:28:23.131 --> 00:28:42.257]  Two days ago, FT, the most prestigious financial paper in the world, released a clear, informative, and fact-based article titled, simply enough, Gold Price Rigging Fears Put Investors on Alert, in which author Madison Marridge, let's try to get them on guys, citing a report by the
[00:28:45.267 --> 00:28:48.951]  By the way, we ought to get Ted Anderson on the show sometime today to talk about this.
[00:28:48.971 --> 00:28:50.693]  And now they've pulled the article.
[00:29:04.073 --> 00:29:09.896]  We have a screenshot of that where they said, sorry, the page you're looking for does not exist.
[00:29:09.936 --> 00:29:11.377]  They didn't retract it, they deep-sixed it.
[00:29:11.897 --> 00:29:25.284]  But it turns out the Financial Times of London, and we have this article mirrored on InfoWars.com, turns out the Financial Times story was saved so that you can actually go read what they said.
[00:29:26.325 --> 00:29:32.989]  That's the great part about the internet, or internets as George W. Bush puts it.
[00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:38.171]  When we come back, we have more on Chase imposes new capital controls on cash deposits.
[00:29:38.231 --> 00:29:41.813]  One of my crew members has an account there and confirmed this yesterday trying to deposit some cash.
[00:29:42.073 --> 00:29:42.493]  His wife.
[00:29:43.013 --> 00:29:43.613]  That's coming up.
[00:29:44.034 --> 00:29:49.276]  We're gonna get into the latest on the situation in the Ukraine.
[00:29:49.316 --> 00:29:52.858]  It's incredibly serious and a lot more.
[00:29:52.898 --> 00:29:57.460]  And I will get more into this polio-like illness that's spreading on the West Coast.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:57.840]  Stay with us.
[00:29:59.758 --> 00:30:02.765]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:06.374]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.492 --> 00:30:13.833]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:30:13.933 --> 00:30:16.173]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:30:16.353 --> 00:30:24.655]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:30:24.935 --> 00:30:40.258]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[00:30:40.518 --> 00:30:40.778]  I'm good.
[00:31:10.427 --> 00:31:20.815]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:31:21.115 --> 00:31:22.976]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:31:23.176 --> 00:31:23.877]  Fluoride!
[00:31:24.057 --> 00:31:25.638]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:25.998 --> 00:31:32.303]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:31:32.543 --> 00:31:37.348]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:31:37.469 --> 00:31:43.595]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:31:43.795 --> 00:31:45.958]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:31:46.218 --> 00:31:48.861]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:31:49.161 --> 00:31:52.545]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:31:52.645 --> 00:31:57.229]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:58.069 --> 00:32:02.893]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:32:10.359 --> 00:32:14.923]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:32:15.083 --> 00:32:18.046]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:32:18.206 --> 00:32:23.430]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:25.352]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:32:25.672 --> 00:32:26.993]  We are what we eat.
[00:32:27.314 --> 00:32:31.678]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:32:31.998 --> 00:32:36.002]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:32:36.222 --> 00:32:38.544]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:32:38.764 --> 00:32:44.670]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:33:39.744 --> 00:33:46.227]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[00:33:47.468 --> 00:33:48.268]  The New World Order.
[00:33:55.052 --> 00:34:00.554]  The New World Order.
[00:34:00.574 --> 00:34:01.095]  The New World Order.
[00:34:01.135 --> 00:34:01.535]  The New World Order.
[00:34:01.635 --> 00:34:02.295]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:34:02.315 --> 00:34:02.435]  to 2 p.m.
[00:34:02.455 --> 00:34:03.396]  Central, we're here live.
[00:34:05.851 --> 00:34:09.032]  Weekends, two-hour transmission, four to six p.m.
[00:34:09.052 --> 00:34:09.372]  Central.
[00:34:09.812 --> 00:34:11.833]  Weeknights, seven o'clock in Fort Worth's Nightly News.
[00:34:13.214 --> 00:34:14.694]  Alright folks, thank you for joining us.
[00:34:15.535 --> 00:34:23.918]  We've been reporting on Bank of America, Wells Fargo, all of them basically trying to stop you from wiring money out of the country.
[00:34:24.878 --> 00:34:26.458]  All those announcements the last few months.
[00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:33.141]  And now the big banks are announcing that when you have a bank sale or you have a
[00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:51.347]  Food truck or whatever the case is that when you deposit cash, you've got to show ID when you deposit it, even though it's got an assigned bank account, even though it's got an assigned deposit point into the person's account, you're going to be treated like a criminal for the database.
[00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:55.391]  This is all part of capital controls and to track any type of underground economy.
[00:34:57.355 --> 00:35:04.181]  Meanwhile, the big mega banks launder $500 billion a year in North America alone of drug money on record and don't get in trouble.
[00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:08.225]  But you, depositing $5, will be treated like a criminal.
[00:35:08.666 --> 00:35:12.349]  And a lot of big banks are saying they're not going to even let you deposit cash anymore.
[00:35:12.369 --> 00:35:15.352]  They want to get rid of cash or make you pay and penalize you.
[00:35:17.622 --> 00:35:19.263]  So we reported on this last week.
[00:35:19.423 --> 00:35:24.407]  Chase imposes new capital controls on cash deposits.
[00:35:25.248 --> 00:35:27.190]  And one of my crew members brought this in this morning.
[00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.111]  We already had a screenshot of this letter.
[00:35:29.852 --> 00:35:40.160]  But we actually have the physical card that they were given, where you can't just drive in and put the cash in an envelope in the night drop.
[00:35:41.461 --> 00:35:47.226]  You've got to wait till the day and drive through and show them your ID so it can be put in the database.
[00:35:48.484 --> 00:35:49.485]  Important news.
[00:35:50.265 --> 00:35:54.027]  See, it's not police state changes treating you like a prisoner.
[00:35:54.067 --> 00:35:54.668]  It's news.
[00:35:55.208 --> 00:35:56.989]  Important news about cash deposits.
[00:35:58.009 --> 00:36:03.292]  When making a cash deposit, please deposit only into personal accounts that list your name.
[00:36:04.013 --> 00:36:07.435]  Be ready to show a valid ID for deposits for personal and business accounts.
[00:36:08.322 --> 00:36:11.084]  Please talk to us about alternative deposit options.
[00:36:11.485 --> 00:36:12.406]  We're happy to help.
[00:36:12.486 --> 00:36:12.866]  J.P.
[00:36:12.906 --> 00:36:14.487]  Morgan Chase, N.A.
[00:36:14.547 --> 00:36:15.829]  member, F.D.I.C.
[00:36:16.509 --> 00:36:18.191]  and Federal Reserve shareholder, I should add.
[00:36:20.012 --> 00:36:22.815]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:24.476 --> 00:36:25.777]  That is going on.
[00:36:26.618 --> 00:36:28.179]  That is unfolding.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.501]  That is what is happening.
[00:36:31.162 --> 00:36:33.084]  And we live in a completely
[00:36:35.518 --> 00:36:39.540]  Rigged system that is accelerating towards internal capital controls.
[00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:42.382]  Another telltale sign on our road to tyranny.
[00:36:43.202 --> 00:36:45.063]  I want to get to some other news here.
[00:36:46.624 --> 00:36:49.346]  But first off, I know the guys gave it to me, but I can't find it.
[00:36:49.366 --> 00:36:50.506]  Will you give me another video list?
[00:36:51.387 --> 00:36:52.468]  Please, thank you very much.
[00:36:52.488 --> 00:36:59.491]  I know there's some video clips and reports that I want to get to as well.
[00:36:59.952 --> 00:37:01.433]  And we do have the winner.
[00:37:02.623 --> 00:37:18.374]  Up on Infowars.com right now of the NSA, TSA tyranny contest, because the NSA and TSA have been threatening people with arrests, suing people, and threatening suits that are critical of them.
[00:37:19.235 --> 00:37:21.317]  And so we funded back in December.
[00:37:23.201 --> 00:37:30.244]  A $10,000 one place, one winner, first place winner prize and hundreds of great videos got produced.
[00:37:30.344 --> 00:37:35.887]  Everyone is a winner that entered the contest and some of the videos got half a million views.
[00:37:35.927 --> 00:37:38.748]  Some of the biggest ones, a lot of the others got hundreds of thousands of views.
[00:37:38.768 --> 00:37:42.770]  So millions of people ended up seeing this and you've done a great job.
[00:37:43.650 --> 00:38:03.637]  The winner is Dick Johnson TSA Wonderkind by David Kirk West, writer, director, cinematographer, and it deals with the pre-screening that's really NSA pre-screening where they track everything you do and use the TSA as the front to data mine all your information.
[00:38:04.648 --> 00:38:09.693]  It's now causing a lot of controversy, obviously, because it's totally unconstitutional.
[00:38:10.534 --> 00:38:22.125]  We're going to be airing part of this a little bit later on the show, though it's more, obviously, constructive and inducive to see how good it is watching it.
[00:38:22.545 --> 00:38:28.731]  The video is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:38:31.215 --> 00:38:39.319]  Again, we probably want to check my computer in here, because even an hour after an article goes up, it won't show me new stories on this computer.
[00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:47.823]  It's very strange, because I know he put it up before the show even started, and as you can see on my computer, it is not the top story.
[00:38:48.283 --> 00:38:55.566]  But on your computer out there, it is the top story, up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:55.586 --> 00:38:57.047]  We're going to send it out on Twitter.
[00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:08.348]  And on Facebook, and it's a good way to fight back against their tyranny, to send this on to the rest of the folks on your Facebook, to send this on to the rest of the folks on your Twitter.
[00:39:09.008 --> 00:39:15.953]  But coming up in the next break, I will tweet it, and I will Facebook it out there for everybody.
[00:39:19.515 --> 00:39:25.479]  Now, continuing here with the news, I want to get your take on Obamacare.
[00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:33.503]  From Obamacare supporters, you know that they promised you could keep your doctor, you could have preexisting conditions, you wouldn't be kicked off your insurance.
[00:39:33.843 --> 00:39:37.126]  It would cut the cost down to the cost of a phone bill or cable bill.
[00:39:37.146 --> 00:39:39.368]  Of course, it's done the opposite.
[00:39:40.489 --> 00:39:46.273]  And now the IRS is announcing they will be taking it out of your bank account and out of your wages on the IRS website.
[00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:51.378]  Headline, IRS warns Obamacare tax must be paid with tax return.
[00:39:53.832 --> 00:40:04.955]  And the Supreme Court has ruled this is a tax to the offshore banks openly.
[00:40:05.215 --> 00:40:07.696]  So I think that's really one of the biggest stories out there today.
[00:40:08.196 --> 00:40:10.177]  And the bigger story is, why isn't it being repealed?
[00:40:10.737 --> 00:40:11.517]  Only Rand Paul
[00:40:13.027 --> 00:40:21.370]  And Stockman of Texas, and Cruz of Texas, and Walter Jones of North Carolina, and a few others are actually calling for his repeal.
[00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:24.071]  John Boehner and others are doing nothing!
[00:40:26.112 --> 00:40:37.716]  And the argument with some bluebloods is some of the so-called Country Club Republicans, the idiots, or those that get money off government contracts.
[00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:40.617]  Oh, Obamacare will hurt Obama.
[00:40:41.542 --> 00:40:42.966]  So we need to let it go through.
[00:40:43.026 --> 00:40:44.109]  That's completely immoral.
[00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.676]  A. B. The Republican leadership helped write it.
[00:40:47.037 --> 00:40:49.283]  It's for foreign insurance companies and offshore banks.
[00:40:49.704 --> 00:40:50.105]  It's criminal.
[00:40:51.192 --> 00:41:03.561]  And so you will all be held accountable as well for this monstrosity that's designed to destroy our healthcare system further, bankrupt the country, and make people basically become dependent on the system and go on welfare and get their hours cut from 40 to 25 hours.
[00:41:03.801 --> 00:41:04.581]  The list goes on and on.
[00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:11.286]  I mean, this is such an abomination, and the Tea Party's gonna use it to sweep to power if we get behind them.
[00:41:11.306 --> 00:41:17.190]  And I mean the real Libertarian Tea Party that Ron Paul started, that I helped start, when he first ran for office back in 2007.
[00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:27.813]  That's what we're talking about is the real Tea Party, ladies and gentlemen, of eight, nine years ago.
[00:41:29.837 --> 00:41:33.443]  Not the one the Republicans tried to create to absorb things.
[00:41:33.463 --> 00:41:34.144]  That failed.
[00:41:35.054 --> 00:41:40.100]  And so now the whole system's coming after him, and I know I talk about that a lot, but 2014 is the key election year.
[00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:41.482]  Balance of power.
[00:41:42.143 --> 00:41:50.033]  You've got to get Libertarians in as Republicans to block this whole thing, and that's why the enemy says that's the main threat and is spending all their time trying to beat it.
[00:41:50.353 --> 00:41:52.516]  They discussed that at Bilderberg meetings the last three years.
[00:41:52.816 --> 00:41:53.417]  They are scared.
[00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:56.566]  Here's the toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:41:56.586 --> 00:41:56.626]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:56.646 --> 00:41:59.209]  And we will get you up and on the air here today.
[00:41:59.229 --> 00:42:01.851]  But I want to get your take on all of this.
[00:42:01.871 --> 00:42:06.416]  By the way, the Austin Police Chief is going to be in studio
[00:42:19.005 --> 00:42:30.868]  Coming up for 30 minutes in the last hour today, and I thought I'd play this clip where he said at least they're not sexually assaulting people from one of his press conferences.
[00:42:31.628 --> 00:42:44.972]  Here's the headline, police chief forced to apologize over comments saying that at least a jogger didn't have to deal with police who sexually assaulted her like other police departments have recently been caught doing.
[00:42:45.672 --> 00:42:50.379]  And the footage is out there of the woman jogging with the earbuds in on her iPad or iPod.
[00:42:50.759 --> 00:42:51.601]  She can't hear them.
[00:42:52.562 --> 00:42:56.067]  So they tackle her, slam her on the ground and take her to jail.
[00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:01.515]  Means bad enough to tackle somebody because you say they're quote jaywalking.
[00:43:03.114 --> 00:43:05.297]  And but then why didn't you still give her a ticket?
[00:43:05.337 --> 00:43:06.177]  Why'd you take her to jail?
[00:43:06.638 --> 00:43:12.043]  Because it's all about the government's dominance and its authority and its power and teaching you not to stand up.
[00:43:12.804 --> 00:43:15.547]  Here is a excerpt of what the police chief said.
[00:43:16.297 --> 00:43:19.039]  Ricky Melendez and Chris Quintero were sitting across the street.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.582]  Quintero doesn't think the officer did run up beside her like Acevedo said.
[00:43:23.063 --> 00:43:30.749]  I think he grabbed her slightly from behind and it may not be from far behind but enough to where she didn't notice who was grabbing her right away.
[00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:34.693]  Whether or not he grabbed her by behind, it's not relevant.
[00:43:35.606 --> 00:43:37.487]  At some point, she knows it's a cop.
[00:43:38.168 --> 00:43:43.331]  The cop asked her a lawful question that she is lawfully required to answer, and she didn't.
[00:43:44.132 --> 00:43:45.252]  That's why she went to jail.
[00:43:45.673 --> 00:43:49.975]  Acevedo says the woman was only arrested for failure to identify, not resisting arrest.
[00:43:50.275 --> 00:43:52.477]  He says if he had arrested her, he wouldn't have been so generous.
[00:43:52.717 --> 00:43:55.400]  And at the end of the day, that officer has to stop him somehow.
[00:43:55.961 --> 00:43:59.004]  He didn't tackle her to the ground.
[00:43:59.624 --> 00:44:02.588]  It's kind of interesting what passes for controversy in Austin, Texas.
[00:44:02.968 --> 00:44:13.559]  Thank you, Lord, that it's a controversy in Austin, Texas, that we actually had the audacity to touch somebody by the arm and tell them, oh my goodness, Austin police, we're trying to get your attention.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.902]  In other cities, cops are actually committing sexual assaults on duty.
[00:44:17.942 --> 00:44:23.286]  So I thank God that this is what passes for a controversy in August in Texas.
[00:44:24.507 --> 00:44:32.572]  I mean, I kind of agree with that statement, um, that, but that, that, that just because other departments are so bad on average, big departments doesn't mean that it's okay.
[00:44:32.892 --> 00:44:35.734]  And by the way, they did grab her and twist her arm on her back and put her on the ground.
[00:44:36.274 --> 00:44:39.416]  So more, more baloney from Arte Civeda.
[00:44:40.337 --> 00:44:40.417]  Um,
[00:44:42.492 --> 00:44:44.913]  Coming up in studio.
[00:44:45.513 --> 00:44:46.894]  That's not the main reason I was getting him on.
[00:44:47.254 --> 00:44:49.375]  We've got a report we're going to premiere later today if we have time.
[00:44:49.395 --> 00:44:51.576]  It'll be on the Nightly News tonight.
[00:44:51.596 --> 00:44:56.518]  Jakari Jackson went out yesterday to the man on the street asking folks what they thought about it.
[00:44:56.538 --> 00:44:58.839]  The point is, police in the past wouldn't have acted like this.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.561]  And a lot of times they would shoot them or taser them.
[00:45:02.061 --> 00:45:06.323]  You hear about autistic people, deaf folks being attacked from behind, people that don't speak English.
[00:45:09.403 --> 00:45:19.148]  It's scary, because a lot of cops out there really are PTSD, loose cannons, whatever the case is, and they've been taught you're going to be backed up whatever you do.
[00:45:19.608 --> 00:45:32.454]  The main reason I wanted him in studio, and I heard him say this months ago on 590 AM, he said, follow whatever order you're given, even if you think it's unlawful, and you won't get hurt.
[00:45:34.718 --> 00:45:43.164]  Well, actually, there's Supreme Court and state rulings that we have a right to defend ourselves with force from unlawful, unconstitutional orders and directives of police.
[00:45:43.204 --> 00:45:55.051]  In fact, guys, you print me some case examples of that, I know there's hundreds of them, about court rules, you have a right to defend yourself from police outside of their duties, or court rules.
[00:45:56.272 --> 00:45:58.113]  I'll search it, because I have to come up with the exact term.
[00:45:59.194 --> 00:46:03.477]  Indiana passed a law allowing deadly force against police to try to enter your home without a warrant.
[00:46:04.568 --> 00:46:16.613]  I mean, these have always been on the book, but they're having to pass new laws stating that you have a right that when they're outside of their lawful duties to resist.
[00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:25.037]  We incorporate cities and we hire police officers to then be professional citizen arrest powers.
[00:46:25.557 --> 00:46:26.237]  That's all they have.
[00:46:27.258 --> 00:46:33.861]  And now they, like a union, want to get rid of our right to be armed, our right to defend ourselves, and our right to have due process.
[00:46:35.438 --> 00:46:37.039]  I've got a bunch of other news on Ukraine.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:42.283]  Also, a California college student teaches school.
[00:46:42.303 --> 00:46:43.964]  $50,000 lesson on Constitution, Fox News.
[00:46:43.984 --> 00:46:51.710]  Remember, he got cited and arrested for handing out pocket constitutions at the college.
[00:46:53.211 --> 00:46:53.832]  And he's now won $50,000.
[00:46:53.872 --> 00:46:54.552]  They violated his rights.
[00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:05.311]  That just shows how warped the school is to say, oh, to have an official event, you've got to be sanctioned by us.
[00:47:05.711 --> 00:47:07.712]  Well, you're allowed to physically hand out whatever you want.
[00:47:07.732 --> 00:47:10.492]  You're allowed to hand out Christmas cards that say, I love Jesus on them.
[00:47:11.073 --> 00:47:15.834]  The school can't be, if it takes taxpayer money, officially pushing a religious view.
[00:47:17.754 --> 00:47:20.475]  And the same thing with a First Amendment view just for speech.
[00:47:21.869 --> 00:47:23.510]  So, there you go, another example.
[00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:29.973]  And people see this everywhere, you know, cops coming over and saying, I've had Austin cops come over and say, turn your camera off, you can't film.
[00:47:31.154 --> 00:47:35.076]  And I'm a hundred yards from what they're doing, and I go, nope, First Amendment, well, I'm gonna arrest you.
[00:47:35.556 --> 00:47:40.199]  Well, I don't want to have to sue you, officer, but you know, please don't violate my First Amendment, and they'll back off.
[00:47:40.839 --> 00:47:43.501]  In other cities, I've been arrested for filming.
[00:47:43.521 --> 00:47:44.421]  And my cameramen have.
[00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:48.283]  And Rob do want a big lawsuit with Pittsburgh.
[00:47:48.763 --> 00:47:49.604]  And I mean, he had to do it.
[00:47:51.547 --> 00:47:56.489]  He was up on top of a hill filming police attack peaceful college students the day after G20 ended.
[00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:59.249]  They came up to mainstream media, said, you're mainstream media?
[00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:00.490]  Who are you with?
[00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:03.051]  Oh, I'm with Texas Television, Infowars.
[00:48:03.071 --> 00:48:03.951]  Well, we're going to arrest you.
[00:48:04.551 --> 00:48:05.371]  You're not allowed to be out here.
[00:48:06.332 --> 00:48:11.453]  In America, on a hill, over a university, aiming a camera down 300 yards.
[00:48:13.214 --> 00:48:13.854]  That's America.
[00:48:14.674 --> 00:48:18.795]  The cops actually believe that and treat you like you're in an occupied third world country.
[00:48:19.316 --> 00:48:20.096]  Let's go to Thomas.
[00:48:21.089 --> 00:48:22.331]  You're on the air.
[00:48:22.371 --> 00:48:22.931]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:48:24.713 --> 00:48:25.214]  Hi, Alex.
[00:48:25.234 --> 00:48:25.514]  You there?
[00:48:25.735 --> 00:48:26.215]  Yes, I am.
[00:48:27.076 --> 00:48:28.258]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[00:48:28.278 --> 00:48:31.842]  I had the pleasure of meeting you in San Antonio at the gun rally.
[00:48:31.902 --> 00:48:39.771]  I was standing behind you while you were interviewing Sergeant Slaughter and one of his cronies pushed me out of the way because I was getting too close to the king, I guess.
[00:48:39.831 --> 00:48:40.132]  I don't know.
[00:48:40.791 --> 00:48:42.392]  Oh, and I interviewed the San Antonio Police Chief.
[00:48:42.673 --> 00:48:50.239]  Yeah, we did an open carry demonstration, and I had my M4 strapped to my back, along with about 1,500 other Texans.
[00:48:50.299 --> 00:48:55.723]  And, you know, the police didn't implement their law against open carry, even though it's unconstitutional.
[00:48:56.084 --> 00:48:57.445]  They backed off that day, didn't they?
[00:48:58.386 --> 00:48:59.366]  It was a good thing, you know.
[00:48:59.647 --> 00:49:04.631]  But once everybody started dwindling down, you could see them start putting pressure on people to get out of there.
[00:49:05.011 --> 00:49:05.812]  That's right.
[00:49:05.852 --> 00:49:07.293]  Well, we're enemies, you know.
[00:49:07.333 --> 00:49:07.913]  We're the food.
[00:49:07.933 --> 00:49:09.114]  Gotta be kept in line.
[00:49:09.154 --> 00:49:09.415]  Go ahead.
[00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:15.723]  One of the reasons I called, though, to tell you, I worked for an oil company in 2010 over in Iraq.
[00:49:16.164 --> 00:49:20.647]  And when I was there, there were no banks, there were, you know, no debt there.
[00:49:20.868 --> 00:49:24.591]  And we drilled the well, and we made tremendous amounts of oil.
[00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:27.953]  So the plan was to extract the natural resources.
[00:49:28.394 --> 00:49:33.718]  I still keep in contact with the friends I made there locally, and now they all have credit cards and banks all over northern Iraq.
[00:49:35.632 --> 00:49:41.133]  Well, that's why the globalists come in and take down sovereign nations, is they want to get you into their debt money system.
[00:49:41.153 --> 00:49:41.813]  You're absolutely right.
[00:49:42.593 --> 00:49:46.394]  There was the shadow investor that was called Chamorron Petroleum.
[00:49:47.414 --> 00:49:54.715]  Chamorronpetroleum.com, I mean, just looks evil, and the literal translation for it is King of Serpents, is what they call themselves.
[00:49:54.775 --> 00:49:59.236]  So, I mean, I'm a religious person, so it just seemed bad to me all the way around.
[00:49:59.276 --> 00:50:02.777]  I got out of that business because it just didn't feel right, if you know what I mean.
[00:50:03.863 --> 00:50:04.484]  I hear you.
[00:50:04.504 --> 00:50:07.446]  What else did you want to talk about?
[00:50:07.566 --> 00:50:10.128]  I witnessed a wreck over in Pleasanton, Texas.
[00:50:10.188 --> 00:50:12.229]  I'm still in Oldfield down here in South Texas.
[00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:15.552]  I witnessed a wreck and I pulled over a truck.
[00:50:15.672 --> 00:50:17.573]  It was during that first ice storm in January.
[00:50:17.753 --> 00:50:21.216]  A truck ran into the back of a little car and then took off.
[00:50:21.256 --> 00:50:22.277]  He let that car crash.
[00:50:22.397 --> 00:50:26.160]  I got out to waive traffic away from this car until police arrived.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.622]  And the guys were unconscious when I got there.
[00:50:28.682 --> 00:50:29.622]  They woke up.
[00:50:29.642 --> 00:50:30.643]  They were really hurt.
[00:50:30.703 --> 00:50:33.145]  This truck had smashed into them and then drove off.
[00:50:33.655 --> 00:50:36.977]  And when the cops got there, the first thing they asked me was, were you in the wreck?
[00:50:37.037 --> 00:50:37.617]  I said, no.
[00:50:37.977 --> 00:50:39.378]  I said, it's these gentlemen over here.
[00:50:39.878 --> 00:50:44.920]  And he walks up to the gentlemen, and instead of seeing if they're all right, he asks, have you guys been drinking?
[00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:48.142]  Well, that's because it's not protect and serve.
[00:50:48.202 --> 00:50:50.543]  It's raise revenue, put as many people as they can in prison.
[00:50:51.504 --> 00:50:57.446]  Hey, Alex, can you please, in your Star Wars deep voice, can you say Sean is so trendy for me?
[00:50:59.307 --> 00:51:00.228]  Tom is so trendy?
[00:51:01.303 --> 00:51:02.787]  Sean, Sean is so trendy.
[00:51:02.928 --> 00:51:05.093]  Oh, Sean is so trendy.
[00:51:05.113 --> 00:51:08.703]  Sean is listening to the InfoWar.
[00:51:09.024 --> 00:51:09.726]  We'll be right back.

[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:19.303]  In 2008, I was dying with Lyme disease with daily PTSD.
[00:52:19.583 --> 00:52:20.884]  I lost everything.
[00:52:21.204 --> 00:52:23.006]  In 2009, a miracle happened.
[00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:25.788]  I discovered ION and the RNA drops.

[00:53:48.416 --> 00:53:59.684]  Herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:54:00.005 --> 00:54:05.348]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:54:05.369 --> 00:54:06.930]  I can see for miles and miles and miles
[00:54:18.712 --> 00:54:24.555]  This polio outbreak, as the media is billing it, isn't really a polio outbreak when you read the fine print.
[00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:29.618]  It's polio-like neurological disorders they believe caused by some type of virus.
[00:54:32.399 --> 00:54:33.780]  And I have a whole stack of news.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.282]  We're going to cover this on the Nightly News some more tonight, but later in the next hour I'll get into it.
[00:54:38.507 --> 00:54:45.053]  Most of the new polio type cases worldwide have been directly, even in mainstream news, connected to the vaccines.
[00:54:45.873 --> 00:54:49.577]  Just like whooping cough on the West Coast has been connected to the vaccines.
[00:54:49.617 --> 00:54:50.918]  People get it from the vaccine.
[00:54:51.558 --> 00:54:55.942]  And I believe, from the evidence, that's where this is coming from.
[00:54:56.823 --> 00:54:57.603]  But here's a headline.
[00:54:57.643 --> 00:55:02.287]  Paralysis cases spike in wake of Bill Gates polio vaccination effort.
[00:55:03.188 --> 00:55:03.949]  Infowars.com.
[00:55:05.816 --> 00:55:18.059]  And the article links through to the EU, Chairman of the World Health Organization, and others, and the Times of India, you name it.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:24.341]  Here's NBC, Bill Gates polio vaccine program caused 47,500 cases of paralysis and death.
[00:55:30.526 --> 00:55:31.527]  That's just some of it.
[00:55:31.947 --> 00:55:35.630]  The live polio vaccine that's still being given even though it's illegal in the U.S.
[00:55:37.391 --> 00:55:39.172]  is just simply, simply devastating.
[00:55:39.593 --> 00:55:41.074]  So some of that's coming up as well.
[00:55:41.995 --> 00:55:46.238]  The Supreme Court is coming out expanding police searches of homes without warrants.
[00:55:48.803 --> 00:55:50.544]  Tis the season to overthrow the Republic.
[00:55:50.564 --> 00:55:52.666]  I'm going to go back to your calls briefly.
[00:55:52.706 --> 00:55:53.947]  Remember, we're listeners supported.
[00:55:54.427 --> 00:55:56.188]  That's why I bring you the very best products we can.
[00:55:56.468 --> 00:55:58.790]  You hear a lot of talk out there about gravity-fed filters.
[00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:01.051]  I only sell the very best.
[00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:06.355]  That's Pro-Pure and the Pro-One system that cuts out the glyphosates, the fluoride, all of it.
[00:56:06.835 --> 00:56:11.519]  And it's better quality and is the same price or less than leading competitors.
[00:56:11.819 --> 00:56:15.561]  And when you put in promo code WATER at InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:56:17.145 --> 00:56:21.666]  You get 10% off the already lowest price, and we have the full selection of Pro-1.
[00:56:22.067 --> 00:56:26.888]  And we have several other brands as well that are a little bit less, that aren't quite as good, but are more affordable.
[00:56:28.268 --> 00:56:30.469]  So we carry really high quality water filtration systems.
[00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:32.730]  That's a great way to start your path towards health.
[00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:35.951]  With all these designer viruses, chemicals, biologicals out there.
[00:56:36.291 --> 00:56:43.473]  You know, my uncle and cousin died of viral pneumonia with bacterial complications in December and January of this year.
[00:56:44.073 --> 00:56:45.614]  December of last year, my cousin.
[00:56:46.434 --> 00:56:48.916]  And I was talking to John Harmon of Genesis.
[00:56:49.797 --> 00:56:58.545]  Three gold brokers that are in the same building, because Midas Resources is the parent company, guys that I've known a long time, died.
[00:56:59.485 --> 00:57:04.769]  And they would get chest infections and one had a heart attack from it, the other two died from it, directly from it.
[00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:09.013]  And they said, oh yeah, there's a mystery illness filling up the hospitals in Minnesota.
[00:57:09.594 --> 00:57:13.417]  Same thing at the hospital my uncle died in, in Tyler, Texas.
[00:57:14.077 --> 00:57:19.642]  They, for four days, were turning away all patients because they were full of people dead and dying from this stuff.
[00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:23.946]  And I have had this stuff for three weeks.
[00:57:25.464 --> 00:57:26.307]  And have been fighting it.
[00:57:26.508 --> 00:57:29.216]  And feel like my throat is raw meat.
[00:57:30.404 --> 00:57:32.365]  So thank God I'm on the nascent iodine.
[00:57:32.865 --> 00:57:34.646]  Thank God I'm on the survival shield.
[00:57:35.226 --> 00:57:38.187]  Thank God I'm on the purified water.
[00:57:38.308 --> 00:57:39.148]  All this is helping me.
[00:57:39.188 --> 00:57:42.049]  But InfoWarsLife.com, you get the survival shield.
[00:57:42.189 --> 00:57:43.810]  It's helped all my organs and glands.
[00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:44.710]  It does amazing things.
[00:57:45.211 --> 00:57:46.191]  We have the fluoride shield.
[00:57:46.231 --> 00:57:50.613]  It's the nascent iodine and five other compounds that detoxify fluoride, also heavy metals and other toxins.
[00:57:51.513 --> 00:57:53.574]  And we have super male vitality.
[00:57:53.955 --> 00:57:56.496]  We're running that 15% off special into next week.
[00:57:57.516 --> 00:58:00.238]  Uh, and we did sell out of it, but more just came in yesterday.
[00:58:00.259 --> 00:58:03.801]  A limited supply, because the word's gotten out on this.
[00:58:04.282 --> 00:58:05.763]  This was kind of a sleeper product.
[00:58:06.223 --> 00:58:12.589]  At first it wasn't selling well at all, and now we can't even produce enough of it, because it has the eight super herbs concentrated.
[00:58:12.609 --> 00:58:15.351]  Uh, because the word is getting out.
[00:58:15.411 --> 00:58:17.232]  People are reordering, they're telling friends about it.
[00:58:17.973 --> 00:58:19.194]  It works for women as well.
[00:58:19.374 --> 00:58:20.755]  Super male vitality.
[00:58:21.055 --> 00:58:23.958]  But we're gonna come up with a female version that's tweaked, has a few different things in it.
[00:58:25.234 --> 00:58:26.856]  Women really, really like this.
[00:58:26.916 --> 00:58:27.616]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:58:29.418 --> 00:58:34.562]  The energy, the health, the vitality triggers your body to give you a good hormonal balance from the research we've done.
[00:58:35.423 --> 00:58:43.811]  SuperVell Vitality, InfoWarsLife.com or calling toll free 888-253-3139 and you can ask about the specials and get them there.
[00:58:44.391 --> 00:58:47.074]  Alright, we're going to come back right now with more of your phone calls.
[00:58:47.594 --> 00:58:48.355]  We've got a special guest.
[00:58:50.885 --> 00:58:54.286]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.306 --> 00:58:56.426]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.247 --> 00:59:01.087]  The facts are in.
[00:59:01.267 --> 00:59:02.407]  The studies are legion.
[00:59:02.667 --> 00:59:10.008]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:59:10.188 --> 00:59:13.649]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:14.409]  Simple.
[00:59:14.589 --> 00:59:18.930]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:24.776]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:59:25.016 --> 00:59:41.072]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:59:41.352 --> 00:59:43.194]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:59:43.294 --> 00:59:45.595]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:47.776]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:59:48.077 --> 00:59:53.380]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:57.882]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[00:59:58.022 --> 00:59:59.923]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:00:03.265 --> 01:00:05.226]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.666 --> 01:00:08.448]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.151 --> 01:00:19.352]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.032 --> 01:00:20.792]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.573 --> 01:00:22.513]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.113 --> 01:00:26.754]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.294 --> 01:00:31.355]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:44.336]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, for about 10 minutes, we're going to have a gentleman who was kicked out of a Texas voting booth for wearing a pro-Second Amendment shirt.
[01:00:45.417 --> 01:00:50.781]  The Austin police chief's going to be in studio talking about, do we have the right to refuse any order of a police officer?
[01:00:51.222 --> 01:00:55.806]  Well, the Supreme Court and state courts have always said we do, but the police say we got the guns and you don't.
[01:00:56.306 --> 01:01:02.592]  This is the New World Order, so I'm always very interested in the fact that he's willing to come in here and
[01:01:03.766 --> 01:01:06.907]  Get chewed on, but we look forward to that coming up.
[01:01:07.507 --> 01:01:11.548]  Also coming up, NATO responds to Russia mobilization over Ukraine.
[01:01:12.329 --> 01:01:15.269]  Confirmed, Fukushima radiation reaches west coast of Canada.
[01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:20.271]  That is just some of what is coming up today.
[01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:25.553]  Right now, let's go to Hiram, I believe you pronounce it, in Puerto Rico.
[01:01:25.593 --> 01:01:26.733]  You're on the air, thanks for calling.
[01:01:27.859 --> 01:01:35.541]  Hi Alex, I've been listening to you for about maybe a month or two and boy, I see a pattern.
[01:01:35.701 --> 01:01:44.924]  I don't know if I'm being paranoid, but I call from Puerto Rico and I see the government-run healthcare and the militarized police.
[01:01:45.004 --> 01:01:47.385]  We've been having that since the early 90s.
[01:01:48.165 --> 01:01:54.987]  So when I first saw like the outrage about the militarized police, I didn't really get it.
[01:01:55.666 --> 01:01:59.313]  But I guess we've been conditioned to that for decades already.
[01:01:59.894 --> 01:02:05.465]  And I don't know, even the agent Orange, back in the day, they tried it here first.
[01:02:05.565 --> 01:02:07.609]  Monsanto, they ran tests.
[01:02:08.567 --> 01:02:09.967]  I'm not very informed.
[01:02:10.067 --> 01:02:14.668]  I've been awake only for like six months after Snowden revelations.
[01:02:14.908 --> 01:02:15.749]  Oh, you're informed.
[01:02:16.769 --> 01:02:19.089]  Look, it's an illegal spying takeover.
[01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:23.890]  It's a criminal government mobilizing paramilitarily against us.
[01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:35.793]  And they're getting armored vehicles, you name it, lining up, setting up an epic police state, and then again training that the number one enemy is gun owners and patriots.
[01:02:35.813 --> 01:02:36.093]  Go ahead.
[01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:47.074]  I'm not a gun owner, but I have to tell you, here in Puerto Rico, we have one of the strictest gun control policies you can ever find.
[01:02:47.094 --> 01:03:00.659]  I remember my dad, back in the 80s, he needed to wait for like a year or over a year to get a revolver, a .38 caliber revolver, so most law-abiding citizens, they either
[01:03:01.331 --> 01:03:04.052]  You know, have a gun or they don't.
[01:03:04.232 --> 01:03:08.434]  But, you know, actually I lost four friends of mine last year.
[01:03:08.954 --> 01:03:12.115]  None of them was killed by a law-abiding citizen gun owner.
[01:03:12.695 --> 01:03:14.876]  So, I don't think that's going to work.
[01:03:15.156 --> 01:03:15.456]  Sure.
[01:03:15.476 --> 01:03:23.980]  I mean, the system knows not letting the general public have guns turns you into Chicago or New York, murder capitals, or Mexico.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.581]  It's because it's a criminal instinct to disarm the slaves.
[01:03:29.322 --> 01:03:30.162]  And that's what's happened.
[01:03:34.634 --> 01:03:44.341]  And the other thing I had, um, I noticed that yesterday you were talking about over-feminized little girls and the estrogen mimickers and all that.
[01:03:44.361 --> 01:03:44.421]  Yes.
[01:03:45.262 --> 01:03:56.811]  And, uh, I noticed, like, we usually take pride in that, but, like, little girls here, you see, like, eight, nine-year-old girls with breasts and, like, you know, overdeveloped bodies.
[01:03:57.555 --> 01:04:00.616]  And we always take pride in that, but I don't know.
[01:04:00.676 --> 01:04:15.423]  Maybe I'm being paranoid, but are they using us as guinea pigs for their bigger, more nefarious... There is no doubt, sir, that it's accelerating the aging process and cutting decades off girls' lives, all the hormones.
[01:04:15.943 --> 01:04:19.685]  But again, they want to feminize men so it doubles down on the women.
[01:04:20.485 --> 01:04:21.225]  That's what's happening.
[01:04:21.406 --> 01:04:22.206]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:22.246 --> 01:04:22.946]  Good point, sir.
[01:04:23.847 --> 01:04:25.567]  From Puerto Rico.
[01:04:25.707 --> 01:04:26.388]  Beautiful island.
[01:04:27.008 --> 01:04:30.530]  We're going to come back and talk to Dave, Jerome, Sid, Rob and others.
[01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:33.752]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:04:33.792 --> 01:04:41.316]  And I'm also going to get into California's smartphone kill switch proposal going nationwide.
[01:04:42.656 --> 01:04:47.519]  This is where they can remote control everything in your house, not just your so-called smartphone that's really a computer.
[01:04:48.019 --> 01:04:51.241]  Confirmed, Fukushima radiation reaches the west coast of Canada.
[01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:55.426]  That is all coming up and more.
[01:04:55.586 --> 01:05:07.521]  Mike Adams will be with us for 15 minutes at the start of the next hour, talking about Google, robots, Kurzweil's AI, and why self-aware machines will inevitably seek to destroy humanity.
[01:05:07.922 --> 01:05:08.342]  Stay with us.
[01:05:10.379 --> 01:05:19.384]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:05:19.464 --> 01:05:27.548]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:05:27.868 --> 01:05:32.571]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:05:32.731 --> 01:05:39.475]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:46.619]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:05:46.699 --> 01:05:53.563]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:05:53.723 --> 01:05:58.087]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:05:58.207 --> 01:06:01.471]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:06:01.591 --> 01:06:07.737]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:09.578]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[01:06:10.379 --> 01:06:13.721]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:06:13.821 --> 01:06:16.042]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:06:16.242 --> 01:06:24.526]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:06:24.826 --> 01:06:35.051]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:06:35.371 --> 01:06:48.798]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Supermel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:06:49.178 --> 01:06:55.281]  Supermel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:06:55.522 --> 01:07:04.146]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Supermel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[01:07:04.266 --> 01:07:08.228]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality.
[01:07:08.428 --> 01:07:09.929]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:20.836]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:07:21.156 --> 01:07:22.997]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:07:23.177 --> 01:07:23.877]  Fluoride.
[01:07:24.077 --> 01:07:25.657]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:25.997 --> 01:07:32.299]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:07:32.559 --> 01:07:35.399]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[01:07:35.519 --> 01:07:37.359]  And the results are on record.
[01:07:37.479 --> 01:07:43.600]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:07:43.801 --> 01:07:45.961]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:07:46.221 --> 01:07:48.861]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:07:49.161 --> 01:07:52.562]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[01:08:21.581 --> 01:08:22.462]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:23.123 --> 01:08:26.727]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.327 --> 01:08:31.392]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:48.221]  More of your phone calls are coming up, but right now let me hit some more of the news that just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:49.622]  Polster!
[01:08:50.622 --> 01:08:52.363]  Top polster in the U.S.
[01:08:53.204 --> 01:08:56.466]  Kiev-style revolt coming to America.
[01:08:58.063 --> 01:09:07.331]  But the last thing we want, there's video of it too, is for the controlled kleptocratic left to hijack that and bring in a really hardcore tyranny.
[01:09:07.351 --> 01:09:11.815]  You see, they can create the atmosphere for a revolt and then hijack it.
[01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:16.560]  Former presidential advisor says soft corruption will lead to domestic disorder.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:23.206]  Pollster and former presidential advisor Pat Caddell warns of the rise of soft oppression.
[01:09:24.286 --> 01:09:28.790]  And corruption in the United States will facilitate a violent Kiev-style uprising in the streets of America.
[01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:37.357]  He's the same guy that said last week, correctly, that Republican leadership is going after the Tea Party and that's why they won't investigate the IRS persecution.
[01:09:37.957 --> 01:09:40.099]  Because they want it to continue.
[01:09:43.121 --> 01:09:48.206]  What we're seeing in the world, in Kiev, is American values at work.
[01:09:49.158 --> 01:09:54.681]  These people and the rest of the world are saying, we're not putting up with this, and we'll put our lives on it.
[01:09:55.062 --> 01:10:00.685]  And I agree that the Ukrainian government was corrupt, but the last Western-backed government was corrupt too.
[01:10:01.185 --> 01:10:05.788]  And George Soros and the West are in there with the State Department, stirring it up.
[01:10:06.308 --> 01:10:07.349]  It'll end up being worse.
[01:10:07.449 --> 01:10:08.650]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:10.831]  And it starts a confrontation with Russia.
[01:10:10.891 --> 01:10:12.252]  We shouldn't be involved, is my point.
[01:10:14.011 --> 01:10:26.862]  In this country, a populace equally dissatisfied with its political class and its leadership, we don't have the same overt oppression, but we have a very soft oppression of complacency and corruption, he added.
[01:10:27.562 --> 01:10:36.209]  Cadell then made a bold claim of jaw-dropping scenes of rioting their civil war witnessed over the past few weeks on the streets of Kiev or coming to America.
[01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:37.330]  Here's the quote.
[01:10:38.791 --> 01:10:41.414]  And the American people, what you're seeing there,
[01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:44.452]  They need their own outlet for that.
[01:10:44.852 --> 01:10:46.973]  It's a warning because it's coming.
[01:10:47.933 --> 01:10:51.434]  Full video and more of the transcript up on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:51.454 --> 01:10:52.795]  I think that's a newsworthy story.
[01:10:53.315 --> 01:11:06.040]  And what's also newsworthy and ties into this is what the Southern Poverty Law Center came out a few days ago and said.
[01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:15.092]  More than half of white Americans are anti-black, and they use some weird flim-flam numbers that they dug up to say that.
[01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:22.214]  Now, you're saying, what does that have to do with revolt in Kiev and the Tea Party?
[01:11:23.735 --> 01:11:33.478]  Their only hope, socially, is to get everybody divided on race, religion, region, sexual preference,
[01:11:34.634 --> 01:11:45.100]  Make that the issue so all the other rights can be taken and then we just fight over those and only see discrimination as coming from a racial or religious component.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:48.002]  Not foreign banks looting us of tens of trillions of dollars a year.
[01:11:48.843 --> 01:11:53.265]  Not foreign banks getting rid of our due process and looting our bank accounts and stealing our pension funds.
[01:11:54.426 --> 01:11:56.947]  Not globalists using our tax money to fund all these wars.
[01:11:58.368 --> 01:12:00.630]  They don't want us thinking along those lines.
[01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:02.591]  They want us only thinking racially.
[01:12:03.513 --> 01:12:05.034]  And that's the divide and conquer strategy.
[01:12:05.734 --> 01:12:08.095]  They don't want us thinking about things like this either.
[01:12:08.735 --> 01:12:12.657]  In Mississippi, 72% of babies aborted are black.
[01:12:15.539 --> 01:12:17.019]  26.6% are white.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.261]  So you can't get a black organization
[01:12:21.172 --> 01:12:24.993]  Like the NAACP and all these groups run by the globalists to talk about that.
[01:12:25.453 --> 01:12:40.316]  You can't get one Hispanic group to talk about the forced inoculation of every girl in Mexico with Gardasil on record that will cause autoimmune disorders in their reproductive tract and will actually kill a lot of them, and that's on record.
[01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:47.438]  Now, see, I don't want unlimited illegal aliens from Latin America in here because they're ignorant.
[01:12:48.612 --> 01:12:52.034]  They have been dumbed down in a political system of fraud, just like Americans.
[01:12:52.794 --> 01:12:57.137]  And they will vote to take my guns, they will vote to go along with the system, and that's on record.
[01:12:57.757 --> 01:12:58.998]  But I don't want them to be dead.
[01:12:59.018 --> 01:13:01.059]  I care about them.
[01:13:02.459 --> 01:13:06.862]  But see, in a racial level, it feels better just to hate me because I'm white.
[01:13:08.834 --> 01:13:12.698]  It's like, okay, go ahead and abort, you know, and go ahead and sterilize the Hispanic women.
[01:13:12.718 --> 01:13:14.559]  You know, that's loving and liberal.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:22.747]  But if you don't want us to come here and get free welfare and have our babies free, and then vote to take your guns, well then you're a racist.
[01:13:25.209 --> 01:13:35.118]  The truth is, I don't like the political mindset of people in Latin America that have been taught that the only way to revolt is aka Che Guevara communism.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:54.366]  The truth is, if you weren't on welfare, on average, and if you weren't voting for political collectivism in my enslavement, we need 30 million people from Mexico here, because we've aborted the Hispanic black and white babies, 55 million of them.
[01:13:55.186 --> 01:13:59.987]  So, it's what's going on between your ears that I don't like, not the color of your skin.
[01:14:01.528 --> 01:14:03.469]  And here it is, right here, 72% of black babies
[01:14:05.962 --> 01:14:11.784]  Aborted, but you're never going to hear the Southern Poverty Law Center that claims they care about black people.
[01:14:12.244 --> 01:14:14.624]  Oprah Winfrey is going to be financing a new Martin Luther King movie.
[01:14:14.684 --> 01:14:16.365]  You know that's going to be a bunch of race baiting.
[01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:24.947]  They'll probably have Martin Luther King give a speech and say, you know, you judge people on their color and what group they're part of, not on the character of their deeds.
[01:14:25.787 --> 01:14:32.149]  Of course, he said you don't judge people on their color, you judge them on the content and character of their deeds and what they stand for.
[01:14:33.462 --> 01:14:37.245]  But this is how these groups are operating, erasing history.
[01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:52.499]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of the Southern Poverty Law Center, with its hundreds of millions a year, and taxpayer money and the rest of it, that demonize yours truly and others and imply I'm a racist, deeply racist, as MSNBC says.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:15:00.246]  Here they are race baiting saying half of whites, that's the half that vote Republican, are fundamentally anti-black.
[01:15:02.119 --> 01:15:06.924]  Even though they're fundamentally against aborting black babies, they still are fundamentally against blacks.
[01:15:07.004 --> 01:15:10.227]  If you want to chop a baby up, a black baby, that's loving and liberal.
[01:15:10.547 --> 01:15:11.928]  If you're against it, it's because you're racist.
[01:15:11.948 --> 01:15:17.854]  Let's go ahead and go to the race pimp, the race hustler, POTOC.
[01:15:19.091 --> 01:15:36.376]  There's polling that shows that both implicit and explicit anti-black attitudes among American whites have gone up quite significantly between 2008 and 2012 to the point where now more than half of white Americans have these anti-black attitudes.
[01:15:36.536 --> 01:15:43.586]  Half of white Americans have anti-black attitudes.
[01:15:43.966 --> 01:15:44.587]  Are you white?
[01:15:44.627 --> 01:15:45.609]  Did you wake up this morning?
[01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:46.149]  You're racist.
[01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:49.194]  And I know the polls he's talking about, they're in Gallup and others.
[01:15:50.135 --> 01:15:53.239]  No, you had a majority of whites that voted to elect Barack Obama.
[01:15:54.119 --> 01:16:12.204]  And then everything turned into race-baiting, and everybody got told how racist they were, and even liberal, bleeding-heart, self-loathing white people are now getting mad, and getting sick of being called names, getting sick of being made fun of in the media, getting sick of being attacked because we're white, and people act like white people can't even turn on a light switch.
[01:16:12.564 --> 01:16:19.205]  People act like white people are like the dumbest scum of the earth, and beat them up, shoot them, attack them, uh-huh, you're white.
[01:16:19.585 --> 01:16:21.386]  White people are under attack in this country.
[01:16:22.363 --> 01:16:24.164]  Because the majority is the minorities.
[01:16:24.505 --> 01:16:27.447]  You put the minorities together in this country now, they're the majority.
[01:16:28.327 --> 01:16:35.152]  And then the majority of women, no matter what color they are, vote for gun control, open borders, total socialism, drones, enslavement.
[01:16:36.353 --> 01:16:38.074]  And that's why they think they've won, folks.
[01:16:38.494 --> 01:16:40.436]  And now they're going to make it all about race politics.
[01:16:41.607 --> 01:16:43.287]  And Homeland Security is for gun owners.
[01:16:44.148 --> 01:16:46.168]  Homeland Security is for returning veterans.
[01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:53.430]  Homeland Security is for the Tea Party, which they've branded as white, hoping, quote, minorities don't get involved in it and feel welcome in it.
[01:16:54.411 --> 01:16:58.072]  Because we can all be unified around a culture of liberty and get past what color we are.
[01:16:58.452 --> 01:17:03.333]  That's what scares the system, is real liberal Thomas Jeffersonian type ideas.
[01:17:04.213 --> 01:17:06.134]  Dave in Michigan, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:17:09.293 --> 01:17:13.835]  I think he's pretty sane, though.
[01:17:13.875 --> 01:17:16.876]  I mean, he's helping bring down the country for the globalists, doing a great job.
[01:17:17.756 --> 01:17:25.839]  I'd say Barack, who's insane, will bomb us, and I think he's going to use one of those nukes that he stole and detonated, the one off the coast of the Carolinas.
[01:17:26.919 --> 01:17:35.102]  But I called yesterday, and I really thought I'd like to get my info back out, because we were in overdrive, and that
[01:17:36.027 --> 01:17:37.128]  I'd like to address Kevin again.
[01:17:37.148 --> 01:17:38.229]  I think Kevin lost faith in himself.
[01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:58.971]  He's been listening for 17.
[01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:00.313]  I've been listening for 15.
[01:18:00.393 --> 01:18:03.358]  My brother Gordy introduced me to you at 99.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.601]  I know Gordy.
[01:18:05.661 --> 01:18:06.703]  He used to live down in Austin.
[01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:07.764]  He moved back up there, didn't he?
[01:18:08.586 --> 01:18:10.729]  Yes, he still lives in Austin.
[01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.930]  But, yeah.
[01:18:13.563 --> 01:18:19.846]  Uh, Kevin lost faith in himself because he hasn't done anything with the information that you put out.
[01:18:20.046 --> 01:18:31.271]  I believe your role is a messenger, and you are putting out that info war, and you are turning hearts and minds, and you are doing an awesome job.
[01:18:31.511 --> 01:18:34.153]  I'd like to tell you what I'm doing to resist.
[01:18:34.773 --> 01:18:37.034]  I'm using your sponsors.
[01:18:37.474 --> 01:18:41.256]  By the way, we've been making our own silver for
[01:18:41.806 --> 01:18:42.927]  We're good to go.
[01:19:03.826 --> 01:19:08.647]  Uh, saw a good one when he had a sore throat and he ended up having tonsil cancer.
[01:19:09.007 --> 01:19:10.608]  He let them take his tonsils.
[01:19:10.668 --> 01:19:12.668]  They poured radiation down his throat.
[01:19:13.268 --> 01:19:17.849]  A year later, when he said he was healed, he, uh, went back for a checkout and guess what?
[01:19:17.869 --> 01:19:26.992]  He had a growth on his thyroid, which was inconclusive when they checked it for cancer, but he still let them take the growth off of his thyroid.
[01:19:27.032 --> 01:19:32.013]  So, you know, people are, and then back to the vaccine.
[01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:36.191]  My daughter, thanks to your info, okay?
[01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.912]  My daughter had my first grandson.
[01:19:38.932 --> 01:19:40.233]  He's a year old.
[01:19:40.373 --> 01:19:43.255]  He hasn't been vaccinated because of your info.
[01:19:43.515 --> 01:19:45.476]  He's never been sick a day in his life.
[01:19:45.496 --> 01:19:53.220]  He's been around, you know, at parties, at bowling alleys with sick people all around him, picking them up, playing with his toys, touching them.
[01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:58.543]  He hasn't even had a cold yet, Alex, because he hasn't been vaccinated.
[01:19:58.643 --> 01:19:59.424]  All his cousins,
[01:19:59.964 --> 01:20:00.644]  No, I know.
[01:20:00.664 --> 01:20:03.665]  My children are so healthy compared to other children because they haven't been vaccinated.
[01:20:04.386 --> 01:20:05.206]  It's just incredible.
[01:20:05.226 --> 01:20:07.567]  You read the vaccine insert, it says it doesn't even protect you.
[01:20:07.847 --> 01:20:08.587]  Good to hear from you.
[01:20:09.027 --> 01:20:10.008]  Rob, you're up next.
[01:20:11.728 --> 01:20:15.310]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:19.091]  Criminals know that your doors are weak and your alarm system can't keep them out.
[01:20:20.911 --> 01:20:24.532]  That's the sound of the same door, now protected by the Door Sentinel.

[01:21:25.861 --> 01:21:29.462]  There's none better than a Big Berkey for emergency preparedness.
[01:21:29.663 --> 01:21:31.023]  As a backup water source,
[01:21:31.323 --> 01:21:42.310]  And you just can't beat a Big Berkey to remove dangerous chlorine, all types of fluoride, pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy byproducts from municipal water.
[01:21:42.450 --> 01:21:47.092]  Berkey water filter systems are even powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:21:47.292 --> 01:21:53.436]  For the gold standard in water filters, get a Big Berkey at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:58.099]  And all GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[01:22:06.164 --> 01:22:09.266]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[01:22:10.387 --> 01:22:12.388]  Hi, my name is Lad Mandiola.
[01:22:12.608 --> 01:22:19.192]  I've been a loyal listener to this network for a while, and I want to apologize if what I'm about to say comes across as a sales pitch.
[01:22:19.412 --> 01:22:20.133]  A few years ago,
[01:22:20.373 --> 01:22:25.257]  I came across an incredible knife, and made it even better, that uses the patented Emerson waved feature.
[01:22:25.337 --> 01:22:27.819]  We call it the 599 Fox Karambit Knife.
[01:22:27.979 --> 01:22:29.740]  Now I'm not looking for you to buy anything.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:37.326]  All I'm asking you to do is go onto our site at TheUltimateKnife.com and click on our rotating banner that says free training videos.
[01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:48.554]  I'm so confident that you'll love those videos and love this knife that I'm giving a 7-day trial guarantee and you'll see why this is one of the fastest one-handed deployable defense knives on the market.
[01:22:48.654 --> 01:22:56.399]  And if you're as concerned as I am about legislation that's pushing to try to take our rights to bear arms, then you need to watch these free training videos.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.722]  Also, as a listener, we're also giving away free shipping.
[01:22:59.862 --> 01:23:01.323]  Just type in radio at checkout.
[01:23:01.603 --> 01:23:06.467]  Again, go on to our site at www.TheUltimateKnife.com.
[01:23:06.628 --> 01:23:08.930]  Again, that's TheUltimateKnife.com.
[01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.930]  Thank you for listening.
[01:23:16.596 --> 01:23:16.876]  I'm good.
[01:23:40.896 --> 01:23:43.677]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:44.058 --> 01:23:49.280]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:57.564]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:23:57.584 --> 01:23:57.804]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:23:57.904 --> 01:24:00.806]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:24:00.826 --> 01:24:01.766]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex.
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:43.965]  The IRS has officially come out on their own website, they have links to it on Infowars.com, and said they're going to take money out of your bank account, your paycheck, you name it, with penalties and interest if you don't get Obamacare or pay the $5,000 fine.
[01:24:44.025 --> 01:24:49.626]  Harry Reid's response in the Weekly Standard has the report.
[01:24:49.646 --> 01:24:52.187]  In fact, will you guys grab this video?
[01:24:52.247 --> 01:24:52.987]  It's pretty powerful.
[01:24:53.387 --> 01:24:54.168]  Oh, we have the video?
[01:24:54.208 --> 01:24:54.708]  Great, we'll play it.
[01:24:55.908 --> 01:24:56.648]  Yes, yes.
[01:24:57.349 --> 01:25:03.051]  Harry Reid denies all Obamacare horror stories and says all are untrue.
[01:25:04.492 --> 01:25:17.337]  Just like there were no death panels, just like you could keep your doctor, just like Obama swore he wouldn't come after any of your guns, not your handgun, not your shotgun, not your rifle, just like he wasn't going to sign the NDAA, turns out he wrote it and did sign it.
[01:25:18.017 --> 01:25:21.339]  It is an act of total betrayal, hoping
[01:25:22.324 --> 01:25:25.750]  That the public doesn't pay attention to what they're doing.
[01:25:26.050 --> 01:25:27.352]  Here he is, Harry Reid.
[01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:31.079]  Despite all that good news, there's plenty of horror stories being told.
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.621]  All of them are untrue.
[01:25:32.661 --> 01:25:35.326]  They're being told all over America.
[01:25:40.655 --> 01:25:46.816]  The leukemia patient whose insurance policy was cancelled would die without her medication is present.
[01:25:47.216 --> 01:25:50.877]  That's an ad being paid for by two billionaire brothers.
[01:25:51.477 --> 01:25:52.518]  It's absolutely false.
[01:25:55.538 --> 01:25:58.299]  Or the woman whose insurance policy went up $700 a month.
[01:25:59.419 --> 01:26:05.660]  Ads paid for around America by the multi-billionaire Koch brothers and... Hold on a minute.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:06.760]  Back this up to the beginning.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.581]  Back it up to the beginning, please.
[01:26:09.813 --> 01:26:19.559]  Ladies and gentlemen, my dad, in the last six months since Obamacare went in, every two months he gets a letter, I've shown them on air, where his insurance goes up 35%.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:25.103]  So, it's now gone up over 100% in six months.
[01:26:25.583 --> 01:26:26.404]  He's gotten three letters.
[01:26:26.424 --> 01:26:26.404]  35, 35, 35.
[01:26:27.084 --> 01:26:27.605]  Do the math.
[01:26:27.665 --> 01:26:28.385]  That's over 100% increase.
[01:26:37.631 --> 01:26:38.992]  It is totally outrageous.
[01:26:40.353 --> 01:26:45.095]  My insurance through GCN, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, gone way up.
[01:26:45.636 --> 01:26:46.876]  I mean, I can show you the stub.
[01:26:47.237 --> 01:26:48.597]  Everybody out there knows it's going up.
[01:26:48.998 --> 01:26:53.680]  We showed you the letters from Humana in Texas, where it's gone up 500 plus percent.
[01:26:59.085 --> 01:27:01.147]  It's not debated that it's going up.
[01:27:01.207 --> 01:27:02.007]  It's not debated.
[01:27:02.648 --> 01:27:11.474]  But he just gets up there and says, the horror stories are all frauds, and the Koch brothers that funded Bill Clinton, I should add, they're running ads against it.
[01:27:12.154 --> 01:27:12.375]  What?
[01:27:14.036 --> 01:27:15.497]  The Walmart's for Obamacare.
[01:27:15.517 --> 01:27:19.480]  I always loved
[01:27:20.512 --> 01:27:25.876]  The mythical Koch brothers and all they supposedly run when they just hedge their bets and buy both parties.
[01:27:27.217 --> 01:27:28.237]  That makes me want to throw up.
[01:27:28.297 --> 01:27:29.258]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:27:29.618 --> 01:27:37.744]  Michigan Democrat rep Gary Peters threatens TV station license over Obamacare ad where the woman simply talks about how she lost her doctor she liked.
[01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:42.216]  Remember, first Obama said he never said you could keep your doctor.
[01:27:42.796 --> 01:27:44.357]  Then he had, okay, I did say that.
[01:27:44.377 --> 01:27:47.719]  I mean, these people just tell such whopping lies.
[01:27:48.079 --> 01:27:49.380]  Let's go back to Harry Reid.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:49.820]  Here it is.
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:53.383]  Despite all that good news, there's plenty of horror stories being told.
[01:27:54.163 --> 01:27:55.084]  All of them are untrue.
[01:27:55.344 --> 01:27:57.685]  They're being told all over America.
[01:28:02.208 --> 01:28:02.708]  That's enough.
[01:28:02.989 --> 01:28:08.392]  The leukemia patient who was insurance- Well, he sure paused there, didn't he?
[01:28:09.411 --> 01:28:13.554]  When he told that whopper, whopper, whopper, whopper, whopper.
[01:28:15.015 --> 01:28:19.678]  And, you know, when you go into court and things, it's all about how you act calm and nice and that you're dressed nice.
[01:28:20.118 --> 01:28:22.139]  That's who the jury will go with, not the facts.
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:24.441]  In modern America.
[01:28:26.262 --> 01:28:27.102]  What about the facts?
[01:28:27.122 --> 01:28:31.105]  Well, just, Harry's a nice little old man, and he says there are no horror stories.
[01:28:32.295 --> 01:28:34.136]  Folks, we told you it was a foreign tax.
[01:28:34.856 --> 01:28:35.837]  Supreme Court ruled that.
[01:28:36.297 --> 01:28:39.078]  We told you the IRS was going to enforce it.
[01:28:39.118 --> 01:28:39.919]  It was in the bill.
[01:28:40.499 --> 01:28:41.119]  It's law.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:43.641]  Obama said they wouldn't do it.
[01:28:44.001 --> 01:28:44.921]  It's in the news today.
[01:28:46.562 --> 01:28:52.085]  The Shared Responsibility Tax, with penalties and interest, implemented by the IRS.
[01:28:54.466 --> 01:28:56.907]  You know, if you don't pay that $5,000 in a year, it'll be like $15,000.
[01:28:57.548 --> 01:29:01.850]  And folks, nobody... And hey, when all this happens,
[01:29:03.928 --> 01:29:08.816]  They're just gonna say, oh, well that's a minority of people, or oh, they're just Tea Party people, or oh...
[01:29:09.633 --> 01:29:10.793]  No, this isn't happening to anyone.
[01:29:11.034 --> 01:29:13.455]  We're on the IRS website right now, if you're a TV viewer.
[01:29:14.635 --> 01:29:17.156]  Questions and answers on the Individual Shared Responsibility Provision.
[01:29:17.536 --> 01:29:19.097]  This is IRS.gov, okay?
[01:29:19.557 --> 01:29:34.503]  The provision applies to individuals of all ages, including children, the adult or married couple who can claim a child or another individual as dependent for federal income tax purposes, is responsible for making for the payment, if the dependent does not have coverage or an exemption.
[01:29:35.441 --> 01:29:38.705]  When does the Individual Shared Responsibility Provision go into effect?
[01:29:38.725 --> 01:29:38.705]  2014.
[01:29:38.765 --> 01:29:48.718]  They go on to say you will be taxed in 2015 by the IRS if you don't get the insurance and list it on your form.
[01:29:49.039 --> 01:29:50.721]  They're going to be the new police of everything.
[01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:53.243]  That's IRS.gov, Harry Reid.
[01:29:53.583 --> 01:29:54.665]  Is that a horror story?
[01:29:55.385 --> 01:29:56.006]  Is that real?
[01:29:56.246 --> 01:29:59.549]  You bet it is, you little lion, gangster thug, scumbag!
[01:29:59.629 --> 01:30:00.530]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.011 --> 01:30:02.592]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.612 --> 01:30:06.256]  Alex Jones and the GCN... Sick of these liars!
[01:30:06.696 --> 01:30:07.357]  He's trash!
[01:30:10.194 --> 01:30:11.835]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:30:12.075 --> 01:30:15.597]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:30:15.737 --> 01:30:20.140]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:26.264]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:30:26.384 --> 01:30:37.170]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:43.674]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:30:43.854 --> 01:31:00.863]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:31:07.847 --> 01:31:12.430]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:17.573]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:31:17.813 --> 01:31:25.698]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:31:25.938 --> 01:31:30.261]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:31:30.481 --> 01:31:34.283]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:31:34.423 --> 01:31:40.124]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:31:40.364 --> 01:31:43.145]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:31:43.545 --> 01:31:48.766]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:31:48.906 --> 01:31:57.028]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:32:09.693 --> 01:32:13.035]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:32:13.135 --> 01:32:15.356]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:32:15.557 --> 01:32:23.842]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:32:24.142 --> 01:32:34.348]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:32:34.688 --> 01:32:48.116]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:54.619]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:33:26.564 --> 01:33:30.388]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.002 --> 01:33:59.222]  Then we return weeknight, 7 o'clock central, with InfoWars and Nightly News, and the InfoWars Nightly News team, led by David Knight, Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, Darren McBreen, Rob Dew, Marcos Morales, and many others.
[01:34:00.163 --> 01:34:01.905]  Like good old John Bowne.
[01:34:02.585 --> 01:34:06.669]  That's weeknight, seven o'clock central, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:34:06.689 --> 01:34:08.551]  I want to thank all the subscribers.
[01:34:08.871 --> 01:34:13.235]  You're listening to InfoWars Live, with yours truly, Alex Jones.
[01:34:14.716 --> 01:34:18.339]  We've got this next guest on for about ten minutes and I'll go back to your calls.
[01:34:18.459 --> 01:34:22.903]  Rob and Sid and Lee and Jerome and Cliff and everybody that is patiently holding.
[01:34:23.703 --> 01:34:30.108]  Then we have Mike Adams popping in on the rise of the robots and Ray Kurzweil saying he's getting ready to merge with machines.
[01:34:30.609 --> 01:34:36.674]  We'll also get his take on the so-called polio outbreaks of people being vaccinated in the western part of the United States.
[01:34:37.154 --> 01:34:38.535]  But I wanted to get this gentleman on.
[01:34:38.555 --> 01:34:41.417]  This story was put out last week by
[01:34:42.398 --> 01:34:44.019]  Kit Daniels went viral.
[01:34:44.539 --> 01:34:48.180]  Man wearing pro-gun t-shirt thrown out of voting booth.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.041]  An attack on free speech election official, not servant, says man can't vote because of shirt.
[01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:56.162]  Problem was he was an illegal alien.
[01:34:57.502 --> 01:35:07.205]  Now, what the law says in this state and other states is that you can't have a political shirt about who to vote for, but you can certainly have one that says Second Amendment.
[01:35:08.045 --> 01:35:09.686]  That'd be like having a shirt that said First Amendment.
[01:35:11.001 --> 01:35:18.423]  This is the same thing where in public schools they won't let a valedictorian say they thank God, or a football player that wins say they thank God, or people can't hand out Christmas cards.
[01:35:18.663 --> 01:35:19.803]  That's your free speech.
[01:35:20.163 --> 01:35:21.024]  That's you personally.
[01:35:21.344 --> 01:35:22.384]  You have free association.
[01:35:23.204 --> 01:35:29.786]  It's that the school itself can't put out an official religion if it has state funding under separation of church and state.
[01:35:30.106 --> 01:35:32.687]  So they've turned that around backwards, but that's a separate issue.
[01:35:32.707 --> 01:35:34.927]  This is just a First Amendment issue straight up.
[01:35:35.788 --> 01:35:38.548]  Chris Driscoll, tell us about yourself.
[01:35:38.568 --> 01:35:39.889]  He joins us via video Skype.
[01:35:40.589 --> 01:35:45.912]  No, I haven't heard anything from the local officials and I want to say thanks Alex for allowing me on your show.
[01:36:04.597 --> 01:36:11.879]  Pretty much what I just believe it's just another attack on free speech and voting rights through the color of law.
[01:36:12.799 --> 01:36:18.440]  And just another example of demonization of gun owners.
[01:36:20.921 --> 01:36:27.162]  On Tuesday, February the 18th, I went into early vote and I was wearing this particular shirt.
[01:36:29.042 --> 01:36:32.103]  And as I was entering the polling area,
[01:36:34.666 --> 01:36:45.411]  They were asking me, you know, which, which party, which party I was going to, which ballot I was going to be voting for in the Republican Democratic primary.
[01:36:46.171 --> 01:36:52.514]  And I heard a gentleman, heard a man back behind me state that I couldn't vote with that shirt on.
[01:36:54.155 --> 01:36:57.156]  There was another female voice that that agreed with him.
[01:36:57.616 --> 01:37:00.758]  And then they, they said, Sir, you'll have to
[01:37:02.012 --> 01:37:03.212]  You can't vote with that shirt on.
[01:37:03.232 --> 01:37:06.193]  You'll have to turn it inside out or you won't be able to vote.
[01:37:07.834 --> 01:37:09.414]  At first, I was kind of dumbfounded.
[01:37:09.474 --> 01:37:10.815]  It kind of shocked me.
[01:37:11.135 --> 01:37:14.416]  And they told me I could go into another room, turn it inside out.
[01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:20.877]  For a moment, I actually entered that room and then got a little bit, a little bit of clear thinking.
[01:37:21.238 --> 01:37:23.458]  And I decided, no, that this isn't right.
[01:37:23.478 --> 01:37:24.038]  I'm not.
[01:37:24.098 --> 01:37:29.320]  And so I stepped out and told him I'm not turning anything inside out and that
[01:37:31.032 --> 01:37:32.494]  And I chose to leave at that time.
[01:37:33.654 --> 01:37:37.718]  Looking back later, I might have kind of looking back on the situation.
[01:37:39.085 --> 01:37:42.368]  If I had to do it again, I probably would have challenged it a little bit more.
[01:37:42.448 --> 01:37:43.409]  That's right, that's right.
[01:37:43.709 --> 01:37:50.995]  Because they were trying to violate your civil rights, keeping you from voting, discriminating against you because you had a shirt that said, Second Amendment 1789.
[01:37:51.455 --> 01:37:57.100]  In fact, show TV viewers that are watching on Skype the shirt, and I'll describe it.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:01.523]  It says, The Second Amendment, America's original homeland security.
[01:38:03.004 --> 01:38:11.847]  1789, with shotguns crossed, with a skull over it, and I just don't know... I mean, that is not an electioneering.
[01:38:11.887 --> 01:38:13.608]  That's not a candidate's shirt that you're wearing.
[01:38:14.508 --> 01:38:19.729]  Well, at the time, I did ask the man, the poll worker there, that was telling me to turn the shirt inside out.
[01:38:19.749 --> 01:38:29.813]  I asked him why, and, you know, he didn't get into the fact that there was some type of... that there was a proposition on the Republican ballot
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:34.921]  But it's not political, it's a basic right, and clearly it was discriminatory.
[01:38:34.941 --> 01:38:37.122]  I wonder if you'd have been allowed to wear an Obama shirt in there?
[01:38:37.142 --> 01:38:37.282]  Yeah.
[01:38:59.443 --> 01:39:19.023]  Who knows what and you know I had a comment when someone asked me you know it stated that you know would they have turned away a Marine Corps shirt because a Marine Corps shirt because it had a picture of a gun on it you know who knows but I can tell you that
[01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:33.459]  It seemed like the tone of his voice and the way that he stated his reasoning and the way that he spoke definitely seemed like, to me, it seemed like he had a major problem with my t-shirt.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.883]  You know, my shirt didn't advocate for no party, candidate, or ballot measure.
[01:39:40.845 --> 01:39:47.411]  It was just stating a law and a fact, the Second Amendment.
[01:39:48.181 --> 01:39:55.766]  If it had said something about, you know, vote yes or no on Proposition 2, and then once again, it's just a proposition.
[01:39:56.266 --> 01:40:01.690]  You know, these propositions, they don't elect anyone, they don't determine any type of law.
[01:40:03.091 --> 01:40:05.613]  They're just, really, they're just an opinion.
[01:40:05.973 --> 01:40:06.793]  They're just a poll.
[01:40:07.754 --> 01:40:10.236]  So, I think...
[01:40:12.299 --> 01:40:19.823]  I really think that they just kind of stressed the law here, and under the color law, I think they may have done something illegal.
[01:40:22.904 --> 01:40:24.365]  Well, that's exactly what's going on.
[01:40:24.405 --> 01:40:25.945]  Well, Chris, thanks for your testimony.
[01:40:26.686 --> 01:40:27.986]  Where is this going from here?
[01:40:28.226 --> 01:40:33.249]  I mean, I guess next time you'll try to wear your Second Amendment shirt back in there again?
[01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:37.132]  I probably will.
[01:40:37.152 --> 01:40:40.534]  I have various other shirts.
[01:40:40.895 --> 01:40:46.359]  A lot of people are thinking that I did this on purpose or I was trying to drum up some publicity.
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:41:03.574]  Honestly, I just put the shirt on that morning, I went to have breakfast, and on my way back, I live fairly close to the courthouse, I saw that the early voting was happening, and I happened to have my voter registration card with me that I had recently gotten in the mail, so I went in and voted.
[01:41:04.174 --> 01:41:09.476]  You know, if I would have been on a mission here, I probably would have been arrested.
[01:41:09.896 --> 01:41:10.516]  Sure, sure.
[01:41:10.536 --> 01:41:12.157]  Well, they always try to turn things around.
[01:41:12.537 --> 01:41:18.539]  We see young men kicked out of school because they're wearing an NRA shirt saying the right to defend the rest.
[01:41:19.239 --> 01:41:23.960]  We see the NFL banning pro-gun ads, but allowing video game ads, showing mass murder.
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:29.702]  I mean, we see real discrimination against the free speech, the First Amendment to defend the second.
[01:41:30.202 --> 01:41:36.503]  So they're trying to destroy our second by restricting our first, and I'm glad you spoke out and drew attention to this.
[01:41:36.843 --> 01:41:38.904]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, Mr. Driscoll.
[01:41:39.898 --> 01:41:40.558]  I appreciate it.
[01:41:40.699 --> 01:41:44.441]  I want to leave you with a favorite quote of mine from Thomas Jefferson.
[01:41:44.461 --> 01:41:49.364]  It states, all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.
[01:41:49.864 --> 01:41:50.285]  That's right.
[01:41:50.345 --> 01:41:51.485]  Any other points you'd like to make?
[01:41:52.306 --> 01:41:53.967]  No sir, I do appreciate you having me on.
[01:41:54.707 --> 01:41:55.828]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:41:56.389 --> 01:42:03.073]  Alright folks, we just wanted to get him on testimony to see another example of the persecution of the Second Amendment.
[01:42:04.577 --> 01:42:13.784]  It happens a lot where, again, you're shooting on your own ranch, your neighbors aren't from a rural area, they call the police on you, the police still respond and act like you've done something wrong.
[01:42:16.906 --> 01:42:20.329]  People wearing shirts with guns on them get questioned or thrown out of shopping malls.
[01:42:22.731 --> 01:42:27.935]  And, again, it's only the image of a citizen with a gun that has been made to be anathema and so evil.
[01:42:28.836 --> 01:42:30.397]  Not the image of the state with guns.
[01:42:31.077 --> 01:42:32.839]  I'm going to get into what's happening in the Ukraine.
[01:42:33.877 --> 01:42:38.521]  And California smartphone kill switch proposal going nationwide here in just a moment.
[01:42:39.241 --> 01:42:42.965]  And then your phone calls ahead of two special guests joining us coming up.
[01:42:43.565 --> 01:42:47.588]  One on Skype, one in studio, the Austin Police Chief, Arte Cerveda.
[01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:49.370]  But before we go any further,
[01:42:51.459 --> 01:43:01.024]  When you talk about the First Amendment, it's important to realize that it defends the second, and then it's important to realize that the second defends the first, and vice versa.
[01:43:01.064 --> 01:43:04.105]  They're all in mutual defense of each other.
[01:43:04.825 --> 01:43:09.828]  We came out with two new shirts that are the best seller of all time at InfoWareStore.com, which is great.
[01:43:09.868 --> 01:43:11.849]  It funds our operation, and then gets the word out.
[01:43:12.289 --> 01:43:14.350]  It says Molon Labe in Greek.
[01:43:15.538 --> 01:43:15.758]  I don't
[01:43:32.077 --> 01:43:40.860]  Reef on both sides and then says Info Wars under it and on the back it says Info Wars 1776 in Roman numerals.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:46.221]  Then we have another version that just says Info Wars on the front and Moulin Lambe on the back.
[01:43:46.922 --> 01:43:51.303]  But obviously the best seller is the Moulin Lambe by itself and I came up with this design.
[01:43:51.823 --> 01:43:54.064]  I like this design and it's made in America.
[01:43:54.144 --> 01:43:59.225]  Really nice fabric and very very affordable for how much this cost us to have our Made in 1776 dot com line
[01:44:02.230 --> 01:44:03.040]  ...of products and...
[01:44:04.161 --> 01:44:12.707]  You can go to MadeIn1776.com or link through to InfoWareStore.com to the MadeIn1776 area and see photos.
[01:44:13.487 --> 01:44:22.373]  We'll go ahead and click on that of Leanne McAdoo sporting the new female Molon Labe version that is gold foil sprayed on.
[01:44:22.393 --> 01:44:24.154]  It looks like it's been spray painted on.
[01:44:24.535 --> 01:44:26.876]  An awesome Made in America shirt.
[01:44:27.617 --> 01:44:30.038]  Absolutely fabulous with our reporter wearing it.
[01:44:30.519 --> 01:44:32.540]  And that is a female cut shirt.
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:33.581]  It is
[01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:39.424]  Awesome, awesome, awesome on every single front.
[01:44:40.505 --> 01:44:51.711]  And so this is what all the lovely and little ladies in your life, and fiery patriot ladies in your life, need to have is this new Molon Labe.
[01:44:51.751 --> 01:44:56.294]  The male one is kind of a bronze, not sparkly, you know, male.
[01:44:56.754 --> 01:44:59.636]  But the female is this gold foil.
[01:45:00.518 --> 01:45:02.339]  It's got little splatter marks on it and stuff.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:06.042]  In fact, we should probably put some more photos up there of Leon up close.
[01:45:06.062 --> 01:45:07.804]  People can really see what the pattern looks like.
[01:45:08.124 --> 01:45:10.386]  This is the best Milan Labe shirt out there, bar none.
[01:45:10.786 --> 01:45:11.947]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:45:13.186 --> 01:45:14.927]  Of course, we have the Super Mill Vitality, 15% off.

[01:45:18.148 --> 01:45:19.408]  We have the Survival Shield.
[01:45:19.748 --> 01:45:25.411]  We have the great Southern Mexico, High Mountain, grown in the organic volcanic soil.
[01:45:26.351 --> 01:45:28.552]  Two different blends of coffee that are my personal favorites.
[01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:31.113]  We've got the Wake Up America coffee, Jones for it.
[01:45:31.533 --> 01:45:38.676]  And we fund our operation and support the First and Second Amendment, all the other amendments here, thanks to you financially supporting us.

[01:46:19.135 --> 01:46:20.256]  Thank the local sponsors.
[01:46:21.016 --> 01:46:24.022]  That's how you can keep us on the air in your area and get us expanded.
[01:46:24.463 --> 01:46:27.168]  So again, I want to thank those affiliates and sponsors as well.
[01:46:27.749 --> 01:46:28.811]  Okay, thanks for holding.
[01:46:28.871 --> 01:46:30.855]  Rob in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:46:30.895 --> 01:46:31.235]  Go ahead.
[01:46:32.267 --> 01:46:33.608]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:46:33.888 --> 01:46:36.249]  I'm a big-time supporter, Prison Planet member.
[01:46:36.549 --> 01:46:38.270]  I'm just buying a shirt online.
[01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:44.013]  I don't mean to make Kevin a big deal, but his call yesterday kind of struck a chord with me.
[01:46:44.253 --> 01:46:46.334]  For those who don't know, tell folks what Kevin said.
[01:46:46.414 --> 01:46:49.975]  He said he's been listening 17 years and I'm not doing enough.
[01:46:50.656 --> 01:46:52.096]  I'm not coming up with solutions.
[01:46:52.116 --> 01:46:53.257]  I don't know what he's talking about.
[01:46:54.057 --> 01:46:59.720]  Yeah, I mean, I think where he's going with this is, you're fighting the fight here.
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:01.521]  I think he wants you to be William Wallace.
[01:47:02.245 --> 01:47:05.546]  And you're more of a Paul Revere type of you're, you're, you're alerting everybody.
[01:47:06.187 --> 01:47:07.607]  And it's frustrating.
[01:47:07.647 --> 01:47:09.028]  It's what a burden to be awake.
[01:47:09.268 --> 01:47:10.969]  But I mean, it's also very invigorating.
[01:47:11.049 --> 01:47:20.633]  So, you know, when you, when you see all these things going on and you've been spot on, you've been 80% on another 20%, you probably stopped or cause it to veer off.
[01:47:20.653 --> 01:47:27.436]  And I don't know how much time you spend thinking about, you know, I know you don't pat yourself on the back, but I know that at some point you have to say,
[01:47:28.036 --> 01:47:29.317]  Man, a job well done.
[01:47:29.357 --> 01:47:31.339]  We've diverted another thing, the subway thing.
[01:47:31.359 --> 01:47:35.802]  I know that wasn't all of you and your listeners, but boy, I tell you, you guys jumped on a cause and look what happened.
[01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:47.630]  Oh no, I mean, listen, our listeners, not just the show, and my writers and our team, we've been at the forefront of being the only people to challenge official narratives, and then it turns out time and time again we were correct.
[01:47:48.190 --> 01:47:50.172]  That's a dangerous position to be in, by the way.
[01:47:51.348 --> 01:47:52.128]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:47:52.309 --> 01:47:58.332]  And I can only speculate on what he's thinking when he talked about Kaiser and Ventura and all those guys.
[01:47:58.652 --> 01:48:01.434]  I listen to those guys as well and have for years.
[01:48:02.034 --> 01:48:05.957]  And they're probably scared to death that you are so spot on.
[01:48:06.077 --> 01:48:09.259]  And maybe they do pick and choose, like you say, you pick and choose your battles.
[01:48:09.599 --> 01:48:11.520]  Maybe they pick and choose when they want to be.
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:15.002]  Your buddy, I've never heard any derogatory things from them.
[01:48:15.122 --> 01:48:17.483]  Yeah, I just think it was a big distractionary call.
[01:48:18.003 --> 01:48:21.645]  You know, we've got wide open phones here, but I just, it doesn't matter.
[01:48:22.205 --> 01:48:28.508]  What are we going to do about the NSA spying on us without warrants and using the economic data to corner markets and destroy freedom?
[01:48:28.788 --> 01:48:30.249]  What are we going to do about fluoride in the water?
[01:48:30.569 --> 01:48:34.391]  What are we going to do about the North American Union and the globalists trying to get rid of the borders?
[01:48:35.151 --> 01:48:38.894]  What are we going to do about the attack on the Second Amendment?
[01:48:38.934 --> 01:48:40.895]  What are we going to do about our government funding Al Qaeda?
[01:48:41.215 --> 01:48:44.018]  What are we going to do about Obamacare wrecking the economy and cheating people?
[01:48:44.418 --> 01:48:46.760]  What are we going to do about the Republican leadership working with Obama?
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:52.604]  What are we going to do about Benghazi and Fast and Furious and all the rest of the big issues?
[01:48:53.084 --> 01:48:55.106]  But I hear you and I appreciate your call, Rob.
[01:48:55.126 --> 01:48:56.787]  You don't need to call in and defend me.
[01:48:57.167 --> 01:48:58.828]  You know, I've said this over and over again, folks.
[01:48:59.289 --> 01:49:01.650]  Cass Sunstein wrote this six years ago at the White House.
[01:49:01.670 --> 01:49:01.991]  He said,
[01:49:02.771 --> 01:49:14.893]  We go out and attack liberty leaders and alternative media, people will then defend them, and then we'll make the whole news cycle about defending themselves, rather than covering news.
[01:49:15.893 --> 01:49:17.093]  So, don't defend me.
[01:49:18.994 --> 01:49:22.814]  I'm here to get the word out, and to get people debating it.
[01:49:24.255 --> 01:49:26.395]  I'm not here to win a popularity contest.
[01:49:27.975 --> 01:49:28.295]  Okay?
[01:49:29.236 --> 01:49:30.676]  Let's talk to Sid in Texas.
[01:49:30.716 --> 01:49:31.836]  Sid, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:49:36.487 --> 01:49:39.511]  That's my rebel yell for you there, Alex.
[01:49:40.132 --> 01:49:41.574]  I got some advice for you, man.
[01:49:41.694 --> 01:49:46.441]  I was at the gun rally, and to be honest, I'd be at any rally you supported, man.
[01:49:47.129 --> 01:49:51.370]  I understand that you want to be the canary in the coal mine or whatever, but we need leaders.
[01:49:51.911 --> 01:49:53.871]  We need people to tell us what to do.
[01:49:54.291 --> 01:49:55.672]  People are thirsting for this stuff.
[01:49:55.712 --> 01:49:56.852]  We don't know what to do.
[01:49:56.892 --> 01:50:04.714]  Well, I mean, listen, we went down and did an open carry deal at the Alamo, gave the first speech there since it happened in 1836, because they haven't allowed speeches there with Jerry Patterson.
[01:50:04.795 --> 01:50:05.595]  Oh, he did a great job.
[01:50:06.195 --> 01:50:08.056]  And we open carried and made national news.
[01:50:08.416 --> 01:50:12.037]  That's just one more battle out of thousands in the overall war.
[01:50:12.537 --> 01:50:15.518]  But I mean, I can, I mean, I'm running my own life here in my own operation.
[01:50:16.238 --> 01:50:18.339]  I'm trying to just get people informed about what's going on.
[01:50:18.359 --> 01:50:19.159]  I mean, what else can I do?
[01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:23.281]  Because I'm not screening your calls and I'm just getting call after call saying, you know, lead us.
[01:50:23.361 --> 01:50:23.861]  What do we do?
[01:50:25.361 --> 01:50:27.722]  Well, hey, other people have ideas.
[01:50:28.623 --> 01:50:30.783]  Filter through the good ones, put them on your website.
[01:50:30.923 --> 01:50:31.984]  Okay, well, I'm trying.
[01:50:32.024 --> 01:50:35.165]  I can't even... We tried to redesign the website and it's got a few bugs.
[01:50:35.185 --> 01:50:36.165]  We're working on it again.
[01:50:36.646 --> 01:50:38.506]  I just think people overestimate what I can do.
[01:50:39.026 --> 01:50:40.287]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:45.329]  Sometimes we have amazing calls, sometimes we have bad calls, sometimes we just have frustrating calls because
[01:50:46.314 --> 01:50:47.675]  They just call in and say, what do we do?
[01:50:47.715 --> 01:50:48.416]  What do we do?
[01:50:48.516 --> 01:50:50.517]  And we change the culture.
[01:50:51.098 --> 01:50:52.599]  We start valuing liberty again.
[01:50:53.039 --> 01:50:56.642]  We inform people that the globalists don't have their best interest at heart.
[01:50:57.763 --> 01:51:02.267]  And are converting us from a free society to a tyranny.
[01:51:03.608 --> 01:51:06.390]  But I can't change anything if the public's not informed.
[01:51:06.930 --> 01:51:08.992]  So I'm here trying to point out what's going on.
[01:51:10.487 --> 01:51:13.048]  Huge Mountain House Sale at Emergency Essentials.

[01:51:40.217 --> 01:51:42.799]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:46.943]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:51:47.243 --> 01:51:48.484]  SilverLungs.com.
[01:51:48.645 --> 01:51:51.107]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[01:51:51.307 --> 01:51:54.109]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[01:51:54.309 --> 01:51:56.471]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[01:51:56.671 --> 01:51:58.393]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[01:51:58.553 --> 01:52:03.879]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[01:52:04.119 --> 01:52:07.783]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[01:52:07.923 --> 01:52:09.505]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[01:52:10.166 --> 01:52:14.691]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[01:52:14.971 --> 01:52:16.313]  But not all silver is equal.
[01:52:16.773 --> 01:52:24.940]  Supernatural Silver is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:31.685]  Supernatural Silver resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses.
[01:52:32.085 --> 01:52:40.312]  Supernatural Silver is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[01:52:40.832 --> 01:52:47.376]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is highly effective against bacterias, viruses, molds and yeast.
[01:52:47.997 --> 01:52:55.702]  Supernatural Silver Liquid and Gel are perfect for on-the-go or emergency preparedness and can provide protection at home, school or work.

[01:53:04.368 --> 01:53:06.049]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:53:06.329 --> 01:53:09.011]  Give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance.
[01:53:09.711 --> 01:53:10.552]  The facts are in.
[01:53:10.752 --> 01:53:11.874]  The studies are legion.
[01:53:12.154 --> 01:53:19.442]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:53:19.662 --> 01:53:23.146]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:53:23.486 --> 01:53:23.907]  Simple.
[01:53:24.067 --> 01:53:28.472]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:53:28.772 --> 01:53:34.235]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:53:34.495 --> 01:53:39.857]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:53:40.037 --> 01:53:50.502]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:53:50.822 --> 01:53:55.067]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:53:55.388 --> 01:53:57.250]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:53:57.550 --> 01:54:02.857]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:54:03.117 --> 01:54:07.362]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:54:07.523 --> 01:54:09.325]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:54:17.856 --> 01:54:33.368]  I'm not mad at the earlier callers, but when I opened the phones up, I said, I want to get your take on Obamacare and the IRS officially saying they're going to take money out of your bank account and give you penalties and interest if you don't get the insurance or pay the $5,000 a year fine.
[01:54:34.729 --> 01:54:36.130]  And it's even bigger for families.
[01:54:36.190 --> 01:54:37.732]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:54:38.892 --> 01:54:42.295]  And it's in Americans for Tax Reform article on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:44.757]  And you link through to IRS.gov.
[01:54:47.133 --> 01:54:48.074]  And it's all right there.
[01:54:49.476 --> 01:55:01.753]  I've got, I think it's Kit doing it, might be a Don doing it, doing an article, our own article, showing when they denied this last year when they passed the legislation versus what was in the bill and then what they're now doing.
[01:55:02.824 --> 01:55:06.465]  But that's what's frustrating is this should die on its own.
[01:55:06.505 --> 01:55:07.906]  It's clearly unconstitutional.
[01:55:08.566 --> 01:55:09.466]  It's clearly a fraud.
[01:55:09.486 --> 01:55:10.847]  I don't care what the Supreme Court says.
[01:55:11.407 --> 01:55:12.387]  It's clearly a scam.
[01:55:13.167 --> 01:55:19.209]  And now Obama is saying he will implement whatever he wants by piecemeal, which is dictatorial.
[01:55:19.249 --> 01:55:21.670]  And speaking of dictatorial, there's video of this.
[01:55:22.730 --> 01:55:26.552]  Obama eases penalties for businesses hiring illegal immigrants.
[01:55:27.752 --> 01:55:30.633]  40% decrease in fines belies rhetoric.
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:33.660]  That's a Washington Times article.
[01:55:35.921 --> 01:55:44.843]  And expanding on that, they're already giving illegals all over the country driver's license.
[01:55:45.143 --> 01:55:46.123]  They're letting them vote.
[01:55:47.043 --> 01:55:59.106]  And then Joe Biden comes out and says that it's racist if you don't want illegals to be voting.
[01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:04.993]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with as a society.
[01:56:06.594 --> 01:56:16.699]  And it's very, very frustrating to see the lawlessness of this, but then meanwhile, you don't, you know, put your seatbelt on, they'll take you to jail now.
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:29.527]  That's what a tyranny is, where petty stuff, they catch the general public in, they pass all these laws to make everybody a criminal, but then the elites are all exempt from what they've put on the people, just like Congress is across the board.
[01:56:33.407 --> 01:56:39.969]  We're going to go to your calls coming up in the next segment and Mike Adams is joining us, but I wanted to, you know what, I'll hit the Putin stuff after that.
[01:56:40.469 --> 01:56:46.070]  I want to go to some phone calls right now, but Putin orders combat readiness test for Western Central Russian troops.
[01:56:46.490 --> 01:56:48.311]  They've sent troops into areas of Ukraine.
[01:56:48.731 --> 01:56:53.072]  Russian troops take up positions as Ukraine tears on the edge of civil war.
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:56.801]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[01:56:57.321 --> 01:57:03.024]  InfoWars announces the winner of We Will Resist TSA-NSA Tyranny 10K film contest.
[01:57:03.044 --> 01:57:04.064]  You can see the winner up there.
[01:57:05.205 --> 01:57:12.948]  Continuing, NATO responds to Russian mobilization over Ukraine, pledges to assist with democratic reforms after violent coup.
[01:57:14.048 --> 01:57:17.970]  Confirmed, Fukushima radiation reaches the west coast of Canada.
[01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:21.272]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[01:57:22.947 --> 01:57:24.248]  That's a big story by Watson.
[01:57:24.348 --> 01:57:32.194]  Activist predicts Ukraine-style uprising in China, and now they're predicting uprisings here in the United States as well.
[01:57:32.814 --> 01:57:35.276]  In fact, that's red-linked on InfoWars.com.
[01:57:35.316 --> 01:57:38.339]  Polster, Kiev-style revolt coming to America.
[01:57:38.359 --> 01:57:39.720]  Let's jam in one call before we go to break.
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:41.081]  Lee in Canada.
[01:57:41.121 --> 01:57:42.281]  You want to talk about Ukraine?
[01:57:43.743 --> 01:57:44.603]  Hi, Alex.
[01:57:45.124 --> 01:57:49.467]  Okay, my call is about... I read Zbigniew Brzezinski's The Grand Show.
[01:57:50.841 --> 01:57:51.722]  Yes.
[01:57:52.222 --> 01:57:54.743]  And I'm going to start his new book, The Second Chance.
[01:57:55.103 --> 01:58:06.668]  You know, his blueprint's just there for everybody to see, you know, controlling Central Eurasia, which, you know, to some extent, I'd say they're probably 70-80% in control of now.
[01:58:07.349 --> 01:58:09.890]  So, you know, the whole plan is dividing.
[01:58:10.410 --> 01:58:14.492]  I've actually set up a map in my house, okay, and I've put a lot of the new
[01:58:15.336 --> 01:58:21.303]  I mean, how many bases would you say, Alex, the Americans have gotten in the last 10 years overseas?
[01:58:21.643 --> 01:58:24.386]  I don't know, there's like 700?
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:36.044]  Okay, well, you know, and you draw up, if you put a attack at every country or every base, you know, and, you know, I obviously can't put 700.
[01:58:36.425 --> 01:58:40.166]  I don't have that kind of research behind me, but it's fair.
[01:58:40.186 --> 01:58:45.529]  700 or so, and those are used for narcotics trafficking, white slavery, you name it.
[01:58:45.549 --> 01:58:47.309]  Tell you what, stay there, I'm gonna come back to you.
[01:58:47.349 --> 01:58:48.090]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:52.958 --> 01:58:56.302]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:56.322 --> 01:58:57.363]  And again, that's compartmentalized.
[01:58:57.403 --> 01:58:58.705]  Most folks don't know what the basis is.
[01:59:00.174 --> 01:59:09.182]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:59:09.282 --> 01:59:17.509]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:59:17.689 --> 01:59:22.394]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:59:22.574 --> 01:59:26.217]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:59:27.438 --> 01:59:28.018]  We're good to go.
[01:59:51.405 --> 01:59:57.552]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:59:57.692 --> 01:59:59.955]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:00:03.299 --> 02:00:05.221]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:05.681 --> 02:00:08.464]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:15.168 --> 02:00:15.788]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.469 --> 02:00:17.489]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:19.370]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.810]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.571 --> 02:00:22.451]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.132 --> 02:00:26.753]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.313 --> 02:00:31.375]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.972 --> 02:00:42.100]  Alright, Lee and Canada on Ukraine, then Bernanke is a bum and the professor.
[02:00:43.322 --> 02:00:45.886]  Lee, finish up your point about what's happening geopolitically.
[02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:59.125]  Okay, what's happening, and I've noticed this, it seems like the US and the EU and a lot of these globalists are trying to emulate old Russia, old Soviet Union.
[02:00:59.425 --> 02:01:00.686]  They're drawing up this curtain.
[02:01:01.227 --> 02:01:03.229]  Okay, they're the ones putting up the iron curtain now.
[02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:04.531]  It's not Russia anymore.
[02:01:04.571 --> 02:01:06.854]  Russia, it's funny how the roles have switched.
[02:01:08.121 --> 02:01:17.068]  Well, actually, a lot of members of EU Parliament, like Nigel Farage and others, they describe the EU as the new Soviet.
[02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:21.091]  Oh, for sure, Alex.
[02:01:21.131 --> 02:01:21.871]  I mean, look at it.
[02:01:22.872 --> 02:01:27.655]  Communism is a thing of the future here, as it is in the Soviet Union.
[02:01:27.836 --> 02:01:29.217]  It's a thing of the past.
[02:01:29.757 --> 02:01:31.278]  The rules have completely switched.
[02:01:31.398 --> 02:01:32.519]  Well, that's how cycles work.
[02:01:35.612 --> 02:01:39.594]  Yeah, but you'd think that we, you know, treasuring our freedoms.
[02:01:39.634 --> 02:01:43.256]  How much blood has been lost, Alex, trying to preserve our freedoms?
[02:01:43.356 --> 02:01:59.726]  And it gets me really going to say, you know, to realize that we are so blatantly, okay, in response to Kevin, I don't, I honestly don't back Kevin up, but I also am not going to stand up for you for that, because I know, being a long-time listener, Kevin's 17 years,
[02:02:01.073 --> 02:02:10.216]  I understand the pessimism that goes along with this train of thought when you see everybody... Yeah, the people don't have to blame me that I'm covering what's going on and it's a serious battle we've got.
[02:02:10.517 --> 02:02:12.317]  But I've really talked enough about that caller, thank you.
[02:02:13.057 --> 02:02:16.079]  Let's talk to the professor in Colorado.
[02:02:16.099 --> 02:02:17.079]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:02:17.099 --> 02:02:23.401]  Hi Alex, I'm calling myself the professor because you asked me to develop a Nome Diplom.
[02:02:23.441 --> 02:02:27.903]  You asked me a couple weeks ago to put together an article that talked about
[02:02:29.043 --> 02:02:35.124]  Um, things that people could read to get themselves sort of on track as they're waking up.
[02:02:35.524 --> 02:02:36.564]  And I've been working on that.
[02:02:37.905 --> 02:02:40.085]  Excuse me, I didn't expect to be on so quickly.
[02:02:40.925 --> 02:02:56.768]  Um, and it's been occurring to me, um, that there is a text that I don't know, maybe you are very well aware of this, but there's a text that discusses a civilization
[02:02:57.261 --> 02:02:57.601]  What text is it?
[02:02:57.621 --> 02:02:59.002]  I don't know what text you're talking about.
[02:03:25.498 --> 02:03:26.098]  Sure, I know.
[02:03:27.658 --> 02:03:28.599]  It's the Book of Mormon.
[02:03:29.659 --> 02:03:32.539]  No, I've not read the Book of Mormon.
[02:03:33.279 --> 02:03:35.780]  But I know it talks about government conspiracies and stuff.
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:38.560]  I've read some of the stuff online, some of the quotes.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:39.100]  Pretty interesting.
[02:03:40.301 --> 02:03:42.141]  No, I'm an anthropologist.
[02:03:42.261 --> 02:03:43.981]  I've worked at the Smithsonian.
[02:03:44.601 --> 02:03:50.042]  I developed a number of inaugural permanent exhibits for the National Museum of the American Indian.
[02:03:50.502 --> 02:03:53.603]  I'm not trying to advocate for any religion here.
[02:03:55.273 --> 02:03:56.734]  That is astonishing to me.
[02:03:56.774 --> 02:04:23.390]  I just watched you on YouTube talk with Tex Marsh for an hour and a half about things from last March, and you two were talking about the fact that it's very obvious that the people that we're dealing with, who have taken over the government and are intent on doing all these really evil things, clearly they're being motivated and directed by an evil intelligence.
[02:04:24.347 --> 02:04:25.308]  I don't think so.
[02:04:36.181 --> 02:04:38.122]  Uh, sort of the opposite source.
[02:04:39.002 --> 02:04:46.924]  And, um, and when you said that, I just was thinking, boy, you know, I've really got to include the Book of Mormon in this list of things.
[02:04:46.944 --> 02:04:51.805]  Well, I'll tell you what, send along some of those passages you're talking about in an email, ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:04:51.865 --> 02:04:52.926]  An interesting call, Professor.
[02:04:53.346 --> 02:04:56.066]  Alright, Bernanke is a bum, Jerome, Rick, others are coming up.
[02:04:56.387 --> 02:05:04.989]  But first, Mike Adams, on the rise of the robots, and the polio outbreak, and more, straight ahead with the Health Ranger.
[02:05:05.729 --> 02:05:07.330]  And then we've got the awesome police chief.
[02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:08.391]  He should be showing up soon.
[02:05:10.632 --> 02:05:11.472]  The facts are in.
[02:05:11.652 --> 02:05:12.793]  The studies are legion.
[02:05:13.053 --> 02:05:20.437]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:05:20.577 --> 02:05:24.039]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:05:24.399 --> 02:05:24.920]  Simple.
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:29.342]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:05:29.682 --> 02:05:35.143]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:05:35.363 --> 02:05:51.387]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, using six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:05:51.727 --> 02:05:55.970]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:05:56.291 --> 02:05:58.152]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[02:06:04.017 --> 02:06:08.260]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:06:08.421 --> 02:06:10.282]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:10.562 --> 02:06:15.146]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:06:15.286 --> 02:06:17.668]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on
[02:06:18.388 --> 02:06:23.611]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:06:23.951 --> 02:06:25.591]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:06:25.872 --> 02:06:27.172]  We are what we eat.
[02:06:27.512 --> 02:06:31.854]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:06:32.194 --> 02:06:36.156]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:06:36.416 --> 02:06:38.737]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:06:38.957 --> 02:06:44.860]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:08:37.165 --> 02:08:38.867]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:39.287 --> 02:08:41.889]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:51.908 --> 02:08:54.949]  We are back now into our number three.
[02:08:55.709 --> 02:08:59.471]  Coming up, bottom of the hour, Austin Police Chief, set to be showing up here.
[02:09:00.391 --> 02:09:06.394]  He's all over international news right now for his comments about, hey, at least Austin Police aren't raping women in the streets like other cities.
[02:09:07.234 --> 02:09:10.315]  So we'll get him to elaborate on that coming up.
[02:09:11.156 --> 02:09:12.716]  And say whatever you want about Artie Cerveda.
[02:09:12.776 --> 02:09:13.176]  He's got
[02:09:14.537 --> 02:09:19.338]  He's got large huevos to be able to come in here and face the music over and over again.
[02:09:20.779 --> 02:09:22.239]  He is Mr. Slick.
[02:09:24.539 --> 02:09:30.881]  All right, we are joined in this segment and into the next by the health ranger, NaturalNews.com.
[02:09:30.921 --> 02:09:35.462]  He's got his Natural News Health Labs as well where he tests different products out there.
[02:09:35.482 --> 02:09:42.784]  And he joins us to talk about an article that we had up on InfoWars.com today that he wrote for NaturalNews.com.
[02:09:43.644 --> 02:09:50.769]  Google robots, Kurzweil's AI, and why self-aware machines will inevitably seek to destroy humanity.
[02:09:51.129 --> 02:09:54.331]  And that's what all the other top scientists are saying, but they'll just squash us like a bug.
[02:09:54.351 --> 02:09:56.433]  And Kurzweil doesn't believe in God yet.
[02:09:56.513 --> 02:09:57.613]  He says he will become God.
[02:09:58.514 --> 02:10:07.920]  So I wanted to get Mike, who's a really good programmer and engineer in his own right, to get his take on where the architecture of this is going.
[02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:12.503]  Because it's not that I'm against computers, it's that all of them are having back doors
[02:10:13.544 --> 02:10:14.405]  Built into them.
[02:10:14.425 --> 02:10:20.869]  Look at this article, California's smartphone kill switch proposal going nationwide.
[02:10:21.289 --> 02:10:28.714]  Lawmakers in Illinois have introduced a bill that gives the police a code they broadcast that turns everybody's smartphone off so you can't videotape or tweet.
[02:10:29.495 --> 02:10:31.396]  The smart meters have this, the cars have it.
[02:10:31.876 --> 02:10:40.242]  When they take three parents and make a quote humanoid, they admit it's not really a human, they can add whatever restrictions they want psychologically into it.
[02:10:41.862 --> 02:10:56.305]  We are in a Buck Rogers-type event, so I want to get into the rise of the robots first, but what about the rise of nanotech, the rise of virus-based vaccines that change brain chemistry to make you more submissive?
[02:10:56.585 --> 02:10:57.546]  This isn't coming.
[02:10:57.606 --> 02:11:00.146]  This is here, being tested on the troops.
[02:11:00.226 --> 02:11:00.746]  We are in 2014.
[02:11:01.126 --> 02:11:01.387]  Mike Adams.
[02:11:03.877 --> 02:11:05.618]  Hey Alex, great to be joining you again.
[02:11:05.698 --> 02:11:06.519]  Great intro.
[02:11:07.259 --> 02:11:10.121]  Very serious issues for the future of humankind.
[02:11:10.141 --> 02:11:23.289]  I think the rise of the robots, the two issues to really discuss here are the intentions of those like Google and Ray Kurzweil and others, but then there's the unintended consequences that are likely to emerge from this.
[02:11:24.030 --> 02:11:27.252]  On the intentional side, I think you and I would both agree that they
[02:11:28.544 --> 02:11:33.731]  Humans, long term, from the globalist point of view, humans are replaceable by robots.
[02:11:33.911 --> 02:11:37.656]  They don't need humanity as much as we would hope.
[02:11:37.997 --> 02:11:41.221]  They want to develop robots to replace soldiers, to replace factories.
[02:11:41.321 --> 02:11:43.164]  And they say that decision's been made.
[02:11:43.184 --> 02:11:43.244]  Yes.
[02:11:44.225 --> 02:11:44.445]  Right.
[02:11:44.946 --> 02:11:46.087]  So that's deliberate.
[02:11:46.127 --> 02:11:47.308]  We know that's going to happen.
[02:11:47.648 --> 02:12:12.688]  But the unintended consequence is that these robots, which are going to have high-level advanced AI, Google has been buying up all these artificial intelligence, neural networking companies, there will be an intelligence explosion, and that's a term from the realm of artificial intelligence, to where these machines will outsmart, outthink, and outmaneuver human beings, and then take over, and then decide that humans are the problem.
[02:12:13.268 --> 02:12:26.017]  Sounds like science fiction, but there are a lot of very highly intelligent people who are seriously writing about this, studying this issue, and trying to find ways to keep high IQ, high AI, excuse me, contained.
[02:12:26.637 --> 02:12:33.863]  And the conclusion is that you can't, because at some point they become more intelligent than even the smartest, most brilliant people.
[02:12:33.883 --> 02:12:35.844]  I mean, Ray Kurzweil is brilliant.
[02:12:35.884 --> 02:12:37.285]  He's a high IQ individual.
[02:12:37.345 --> 02:12:38.246]  No one can argue with that.
[02:12:38.866 --> 02:12:45.350]  But computers with AI can even exceed his intelligence and the intelligence of all humans combined.
[02:12:45.771 --> 02:12:46.971]  How are you going to contain that?
[02:12:47.952 --> 02:12:49.713]  The only rational conclusion is that you can't.
[02:12:50.093 --> 02:12:54.857]  So this is headed to a very dark time where we may be at war with the machines, Alex.
[02:12:55.137 --> 02:13:00.400]  That's right, and if you read what Kurzweil's written, but not just Kurzweil, Bill Joy in Wired Magazine in April 2000,
[02:13:01.963 --> 02:13:05.366]  Really, the compendium of their work, there's not debate about it.
[02:13:06.006 --> 02:13:12.471]  They've made the decision in an evolutionary way to advocate responsibility and just say whatever's going to happen is going to happen.
[02:13:13.152 --> 02:13:20.777]  And so they're in a race to whoever can create the life extension systems and for whoever can merge with machines the fastest.
[02:13:21.318 --> 02:13:23.099]  They say it's a foregone conclusion.
[02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:24.580]  It can't be stopped.
[02:13:24.901 --> 02:13:26.862]  So they've just given into it.
[02:13:27.523 --> 02:13:30.445]  Meanwhile, the general public has no idea this is even being prepared.
[02:13:30.845 --> 02:13:31.626]  Well, exactly.
[02:13:32.147 --> 02:13:43.822]  And Ray Kurzweil just put out an interview, I guess a week ago, where he predicted that machines would be more intelligent than humans by the year 2029, I believe is what he said.
[02:13:44.764 --> 02:13:48.168]  That's not very far off, and this guy has a knack of being right.
[02:13:48.869 --> 02:13:50.571]  About technology predictions.
[02:13:50.732 --> 02:13:56.379]  I hope you're all... Well, that's also because we know in the government and corporate reservations, the technology is 30 to 40 years advanced.
[02:13:56.759 --> 02:13:58.241]  It's just in the development stage.
[02:13:59.403 --> 02:14:01.465]  They don't roll it out on us till way past beta.
[02:14:02.062 --> 02:14:02.402]  That's right.
[02:14:02.883 --> 02:14:06.166]  Now, I've been reading this book by James Barat.
[02:14:06.206 --> 02:14:08.047]  It's called Our Final Invention.
[02:14:08.968 --> 02:14:27.404]  And just sort of plugging that book because it's an important read for humanity, this book really gets into the technical details of the intelligence explosion and even experiments that have been conducted to see if computers can outsmart humans and escape any kind of boundaries that scientists have tried to put on them.
[02:14:27.984 --> 02:14:34.269]  And in almost every case, the AI systems or simulated AI systems have escaped.
[02:14:35.049 --> 02:14:39.673]  So because we're interconnected, the world is networked, everything is driven by scripts.
[02:14:39.713 --> 02:14:42.955]  Look at the economy, look at Wall Street, look at the nuclear power plants.
[02:14:43.456 --> 02:14:47.078]  They're driven by computer code and they're not secure.
[02:14:47.258 --> 02:14:51.522]  We've seen Stuxnet successfully invade nuclear power facilities already.
[02:14:51.602 --> 02:14:54.524]  China is in an information technology war.
[02:14:55.124 --> 02:14:56.886]  What if you have an entity
[02:14:57.898 --> 02:15:08.944]  That is highly intelligent, that is not human, it is robotic, it is a machine that wants to declare war on humanity, and that can break any code, that can beat any encryption.
[02:15:09.364 --> 02:15:19.269]  That's actually covered in another science fiction book called Demon by Daniel Suarez, which is a really great read, but also probably more non-fiction than fiction.
[02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:22.151]  So, this is really... Well, I mean, look at the Skynet scenario.
[02:15:22.171 --> 02:15:27.034]  They've already got the autonomous drones, it's all launching, humans are being taken out of the equation.
[02:15:27.794 --> 02:15:41.161]  And undoubtedly because the machines are being built and given the war-like human attributes, that it's not a question of if but when, it's going to make the decision to take humans out of the equation so that it can be dominant on the face of the earth.
[02:15:41.901 --> 02:15:52.687]  And this is why in my article I pointed out that America is uniquely positioned, and especially Texas, uniquely positioned to have a kinetic defense against these
[02:15:53.627 --> 02:15:57.711]  War robots that might be unleashed one day to actually destroy humanity.
[02:15:58.152 --> 02:16:04.939]  And like has been quoted in science fiction novels, we could actually be in a war of biologicals versus the machines.
[02:16:05.599 --> 02:16:07.261]  You know, Terminator type of scenario.
[02:16:07.281 --> 02:16:09.083]  It's not science fiction anymore.
[02:16:09.543 --> 02:16:15.369]  Now, Texans in particular, you know, Texans are, they've got guns and ammo like crazy!
[02:16:16.010 --> 02:16:23.353]  You know, and Piers Morgan isn't even going to be around anymore to complain about it, thank goodness.
[02:16:23.473 --> 02:16:37.378]  Texans could actually possibly defeat robots in a physical war, where other countries that don't have a built-in infrastructure of self-defense would really be at the mercy of humanoid robots in an AI takeover scenario.
[02:16:37.398 --> 02:16:38.579]  So that's something to really think about.
[02:16:40.945 --> 02:16:41.685]  I agree with you.
[02:16:42.046 --> 02:17:00.453]  The main way they're going to attack is in collaborative efforts with humans, because the elite are already designing the computers and the robots to replace humans, and have the medical robots go out with the forced inoculations that have the nanotech viruses that go in and quote, relieve the stress areas of the brain by actually eating the synapses.
[02:17:00.853 --> 02:17:01.954]  Robotomize, yeah.
[02:17:02.094 --> 02:17:04.175]  And so they're going to roll out with a bio
[02:17:04.995 --> 02:17:06.941]  Bioweapon cutting edge.
[02:17:07.001 --> 02:17:11.874]  I mean, that'll be the problem facing these robots is they're already going to be interfaced.
[02:17:12.682 --> 02:17:26.434]  With a weapon system that was anti-human to begin with, and so its mission statement is going to be exterminate along the lines of a 21st century Daleks from Doctor Who.
[02:17:27.275 --> 02:17:35.822]  It is frighteningly easy to end biological life if you are an advanced AI system that controls nuclear power, water delivery, the power grid.
[02:17:36.182 --> 02:17:40.066]  I mean, all an AI system would have to do is crash the power grid for six months
[02:17:40.666 --> 02:17:45.932]  That would kill most humans that live in the modern world right there without even firing a single shot.
[02:17:46.192 --> 02:17:46.733]  So you're right.
[02:17:47.254 --> 02:17:52.580]  There are vulnerabilities that we have built into our modern civilization.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.882]  Some real incredible weaknesses.
[02:17:55.783 --> 02:18:05.045]  And only a few individuals are really trying to build redundant systems and live off-grid and have sustainable power supplies and food supplies and self-defense and all of these things.
[02:18:05.385 --> 02:18:17.928]  They will be the survivors, of course, but you're right, there will be human collaborators with the AI system who will be promised protection and food and power in order to collaborate with the war against humanity.
[02:18:18.068 --> 02:18:18.928]  That's going to happen.
[02:18:19.728 --> 02:18:21.729]  And again, I know this sounds like science fiction, but
[02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:39.160]  It's time for us to really seriously consider this because AI is here and it's getting more intelligent with each passing day and the intelligence explosion that's commonly referred to in AI scientific papers is also very, very real.
[02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:45.924]  Human intelligence cannot expand in a logarithmic fashion like AI can.
[02:18:46.444 --> 02:18:49.847]  So we better be thinking about this now or we may not be around in a hundred years.
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:19:13.861]  That's right, and the elite can't just wave a wand and say, oh, we'll merge with it, we're going to be fine, as Ray Kurzweil and others have said, and they've made the decision that this is the way it's going, and again are building Trojan horse systems of human control into everything for oppression and control, and so it's guaranteeing that the AI systems that develop
[02:19:14.822 --> 02:19:16.223]  Will be anti-human.
[02:19:16.263 --> 02:19:32.731]  That's the problem, is that anti-humans, anti-human humans, eugenics-based humans, humans that are wanting to suppress other humans, not empower them, are literally putting their spirit, like Sauron into the ring, into the computer.
[02:19:33.171 --> 02:19:33.872]  That's the problem.
[02:19:34.252 --> 02:19:41.361]  No, clearly there's an anti-life agenda in this, and it's not even shrouded in secrecy anymore.
[02:19:41.381 --> 02:19:49.110]  Look at the Boston Dynamics robots, which were now purchased by Google, and they taught these robots a game that they call Follow the Leader.
[02:19:49.631 --> 02:19:51.433]  Well, it's really a game of stalk the human.
[02:19:52.334 --> 02:19:55.818]  Because they have a guy running through a field and the robot can follow the guy.
[02:19:56.258 --> 02:19:58.520]  Well, that's how you chase down and kill humans.
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:04.306]  You mount, you know... That's right, and when the Marines train to kill US citizens, they call it a zombie drill.
[02:20:04.606 --> 02:20:09.011]  We're going to come back and talk about the polio situation with Mike Adams.
[02:20:10.342 --> 02:20:12.964]  It's time to kick some ash.
[02:20:13.405 --> 02:20:15.767]  Because cigarettes have met their match.
[02:20:15.927 --> 02:20:18.549]  Smokers are switching to Vaporite e-liquid by Le Cig.

[02:20:40.020 --> 02:20:41.140]  Attention gun owners.
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:46.081]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[02:20:46.181 --> 02:20:49.642]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?

[02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:19.387]  MyPatriotsupply.com In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:23:19.687 --> 02:23:21.530]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:23:21.690 --> 02:23:22.391]  Fluoride.
[02:23:22.591 --> 02:23:24.373]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:23:24.494 --> 02:23:30.821]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:23:31.062 --> 02:23:33.865]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:23:33.985 --> 02:23:35.828]  And the results are on record.
[02:23:35.948 --> 02:23:39.152]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[02:23:39.372 --> 02:23:41.973]  In areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:23:42.213 --> 02:23:44.373]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:23:44.613 --> 02:23:47.214]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:23:47.514 --> 02:23:50.855]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[02:24:14.968 --> 02:24:23.332]  I've got a little challenge for you, Sark.
[02:24:23.692 --> 02:24:24.573]  A new recruit.
[02:24:25.053 --> 02:24:27.974]  He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner.
[02:24:28.374 --> 02:24:32.936]  Train him for the games, let him hope for a while, and blow him away.
[02:24:33.477 --> 02:24:33.997]  You got it.
[02:24:35.219 --> 02:24:37.700]  I've been hoping you'd send me somebody with a little bit of guts.
[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:40.381]  What kind of program is he?
[02:24:40.781 --> 02:24:43.001]  He's not any kind of program, Sark.
[02:24:43.181 --> 02:24:43.822]  He's a user.
[02:24:43.842 --> 02:24:45.062]  A user?
[02:24:45.622 --> 02:24:46.242]  That's right.
[02:24:46.583 --> 02:24:48.243]  He pushed me in the real world.
[02:24:49.263 --> 02:24:53.165]  Somebody pushes me, I push back, so I brought him down here.
[02:24:54.525 --> 02:24:55.685]  What's the matter, Sark?
[02:24:55.965 --> 02:24:56.866]  You look nervous.
[02:24:57.966 --> 02:25:04.088]  Well, I... It's just... I don't know, a user, I mean...
[02:25:06.275 --> 02:25:07.836]  Users wrote us.
[02:25:09.797 --> 02:25:10.998]  A user even wrote you!
[02:25:11.379 --> 02:25:12.960]  No one user wrote me.
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:15.341]  I'm worth millions of their man years.
[02:25:15.862 --> 02:25:16.582]  What if I can't?
[02:25:17.242 --> 02:25:19.084]  You'd rather take your chances with me?
[02:25:20.385 --> 02:25:23.006]  Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
[02:25:23.086 --> 02:25:23.527]  Wait!
[02:25:23.787 --> 02:25:25.048]  I need that!
[02:25:25.228 --> 02:25:26.869]  Then pull yourself together.
[02:25:27.329 --> 02:25:28.670]  Get this clown trained.
[02:25:28.730 --> 02:25:32.613]  I want him in the games until he dies playing.
[02:25:32.713 --> 02:25:33.633]  Acknowledge.
[02:25:33.713 --> 02:25:35.515]  Acknowledge, Master Control.
[02:25:37.387 --> 02:25:38.208]  End of line.
[02:25:39.709 --> 02:25:45.675]  And we go from fiction to fact as the automated drones have been in the skies for over a decade.
[02:25:46.195 --> 02:25:47.617]  Autonomous, operating on their own.
[02:25:47.677 --> 02:25:50.980]  Now the slaves have been told in the last 12 months that that's going on.
[02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:53.202]  Finishing up with the whole robot takeover.
[02:25:53.222 --> 02:25:56.325]  I think people are starting to realize this and get concerned.
[02:25:57.265 --> 02:25:58.947]  But Mike, we've only got about four minutes left.
[02:25:58.987 --> 02:26:00.388]  I appreciate Mike Adams coming on.
[02:26:00.769 --> 02:26:02.831]  Doctors studying polio-like illness
[02:26:03.391 --> 02:26:05.532]  Flooded with calls, now there's hundreds of cases.
[02:26:05.572 --> 02:26:07.814]  First it was 5, then 20, then hundreds of.
[02:26:08.194 --> 02:26:10.255]  Polio-like, but it's not polio.
[02:26:10.735 --> 02:26:18.260]  And then I pulled up the articles where most of the paralysis in India and other places is after the vaccines.
[02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:18.920]  Here's a headline.
[02:26:19.341 --> 02:26:22.903]  Paralysis cases spike in wake of Bill Gates' polio vaccine effort in India.
[02:26:23.483 --> 02:26:25.384]  What do you think's behind this, Mike Adams?
[02:26:25.864 --> 02:26:26.965]  It's very clear, Alex.
[02:26:26.985 --> 02:26:31.588]  This is a massive cover-up of paralysis being caused by the vaccines.
[02:26:32.508 --> 02:26:35.169]  I'm looking at a CNN story, too, here.
[02:26:35.629 --> 02:26:38.210]  One of the few times I actually managed to read CNN.
[02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:44.252]  Because they're reporting this lie that doctors don't know what's causing the illness.
[02:26:45.252 --> 02:26:51.394]  All five children that had been vaccinated, that had paralysis, had been vaccinated against polio.
[02:26:52.074 --> 02:26:56.776]  So, time and time again, we see that the vaccine is causing the disease that it claims to treat.
[02:26:57.356 --> 02:27:04.339]  Then vaccine pushers and zealots throw up their hands and say, well, we don't know what's causing this illness, but everybody better hurry up and get vaccinated.
[02:27:04.579 --> 02:27:05.439]  That's the only defense.
[02:27:05.759 --> 02:27:11.442]  So more parents get their children vaccinated, more paralysis emerges, and the cycle repeats itself.
[02:27:11.862 --> 02:27:14.343]  Alex, it's a marketing scheme.
[02:27:15.043 --> 02:27:17.665]  It's a crime against children.
[02:27:18.165 --> 02:27:19.046]  It's bad medicine.
[02:27:19.066 --> 02:27:20.107]  It's junk science.
[02:27:20.727 --> 02:27:22.609]  The vaccine is causing the illness.
[02:27:22.649 --> 02:27:24.710]  We see it with measles and mumps also.
[02:27:25.291 --> 02:27:30.575]  Every time there's a measles outbreak, if you look at the kids that get infected, it's those who were vaccinated.
[02:27:31.275 --> 02:27:32.675]  It's the unvaccinated kids.
[02:27:32.695 --> 02:27:37.876]  Hey, my dad has hundreds of patients that have come in over the years saying they got shingles from the shingles vaccine.
[02:27:37.976 --> 02:27:38.576]  Absolutely.
[02:27:39.056 --> 02:27:40.057]  It's well documented.
[02:27:40.337 --> 02:27:50.698]  And look, you take some healthy kids raised in Texas that are raised on a farm with farm animals and they're homeschooled and they're not vaccinated, they're the healthiest kids you'll ever meet.
[02:27:51.139 --> 02:27:52.679]  And I've met lots of families like that.
[02:27:52.999 --> 02:27:56.479]  And you know what I'm talking about, because you know kids like that too, they're super healthy.
[02:27:56.900 --> 02:27:57.820]  They're not paralyzed.
[02:27:58.140 --> 02:27:59.000]  They're not vaccinated.
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:02.522]  Vaccines, Alex, contain... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:02.542 --> 02:28:11.448]  No, no, no, it's just they admit overseas that it's the polio vaccine paralyzing them, but they don't call it polio vaccine.
[02:28:11.488 --> 02:28:18.673]  I talked to a pediatrician years ago who told me they still give the oral here in East Austin to the poor kids all over the country.
[02:28:18.693 --> 02:28:19.013]  Go ahead.
[02:28:19.714 --> 02:28:22.756]  Well, you know, the flu shot makes you more susceptible to the flu.
[02:28:24.176 --> 02:28:26.797]  Osteoporosis drugs cause osteoporosis.
[02:28:27.378 --> 02:28:29.359]  Antidepressant drugs cause depression.
[02:28:29.439 --> 02:28:31.960]  Alzheimer's drugs cause Alzheimer's.
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:35.141]  This is the marketing system of Big Pharma.
[02:28:35.701 --> 02:28:38.402]  It is cause illness and then claim to treat it.
[02:28:38.682 --> 02:28:39.383]  And then repeat.
[02:28:40.163 --> 02:28:51.828]  It's so insidious, and yet it's so simple, but the cover-up is so immense that the mainstream public isn't aware that they're being used as a revenue-generating guinea pig.
[02:28:51.848 --> 02:29:00.472]  Well, it's now come out that SSRIs, something we knew decades ago, are causing cancer, neurological disorders, more suicide.
[02:29:01.873 --> 02:29:22.807]  The whole revenue model of the cancer industry is to make sure that people don't prevent cancer, and that they don't learn about anti-cancer foods, and then wait for them to get cancer, diagnose them, and then treat them for very high profits, and bill the federal government, Medicare, or state Medicaid programs, or Obamacare, make money off of people's suffering and people's disease.
[02:29:23.327 --> 02:29:25.689]  That's been the model in medicine now for decades.
[02:29:26.309 --> 02:29:31.433]  And it's going to crash, by the way, because that model doesn't work long-term, but until then, a lot of people will suffer.
[02:29:32.173 --> 02:29:40.039]  Just like Obamacare is a short-term looting of the economy, with the IRS coming after your bank accounts, now confirmed today on IRS.gov.
[02:29:40.079 --> 02:29:44.703]  Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com, we'll continue to read your great reportage and look forward to having you back soon.
[02:29:45.043 --> 02:29:45.483]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:29:45.524 --> 02:29:46.144]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:29:46.264 --> 02:29:46.484]  You bet.
[02:29:46.504 --> 02:29:47.125]  There goes Mike.
[02:29:47.465 --> 02:29:49.186]  The police chief should be showing up any minute.
[02:29:49.727 --> 02:29:50.948]  He usually gives us an hour.
[02:29:51.008 --> 02:29:52.189]  He's too big shot now.
[02:29:52.209 --> 02:29:53.069]  He can only give us 30 minutes.
[02:29:53.089 --> 02:29:55.531]  So he'll probably walk in in the middle of the show like he's done before.
[02:29:56.051 --> 02:29:58.994]  So we'll see if Arne Seveda shows up here.
[02:29:59.494 --> 02:30:02.515]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.435 --> 02:30:06.216]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.216 --> 02:30:12.957]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:30:13.237 --> 02:30:18.058]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:30:18.238 --> 02:30:25.420]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:30.966]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:30:31.186 --> 02:30:34.930]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:39.755]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:30:39.955 --> 02:30:43.899]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power
[02:30:43.899 --> 02:30:45.160]  More outages are out in the field.
[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:48.481]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[02:30:48.641 --> 02:30:50.882]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:30:51.143 --> 02:30:55.705]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:30:55.885 --> 02:30:58.346]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[02:30:58.786 --> 02:31:05.790]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:07.031]  We're getting prepared.
[02:31:07.251 --> 02:31:07.691]  Are you?
[02:31:07.931 --> 02:31:09.732]  Infowarsshop.com.
[02:31:09.972 --> 02:31:20.358]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:31:20.658 --> 02:31:22.499]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:31:22.699 --> 02:31:23.399]  Fluoride.
[02:31:23.599 --> 02:31:25.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:31:26.020 --> 02:31:31.822]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:31:32.082 --> 02:31:34.923]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:31:35.043 --> 02:31:36.883]  And the results are on record.
[02:31:37.003 --> 02:31:43.125]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:31:43.325 --> 02:31:45.506]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:31:45.746 --> 02:31:48.367]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:31:48.687 --> 02:31:52.068]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:31:52.188 --> 02:31:57.393]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:57.613 --> 02:32:02.417]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[02:32:02.718 --> 02:32:03.759]  I take it every day.
[02:32:03.919 --> 02:32:06.781]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:09.844 --> 02:32:18.833]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:32:18.914 --> 02:32:27.042]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:27.322 --> 02:32:32.004]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:32:32.184 --> 02:32:38.907]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:38.987 --> 02:32:46.071]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:32:46.171 --> 02:32:53.014]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:32:53.174 --> 02:32:57.537]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:32:57.657 --> 02:33:00.919]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:33:01.059 --> 02:33:07.182]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:33:07.343 --> 02:33:09.044]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:22.128 --> 02:33:24.249]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:24.749 --> 02:33:26.430]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.533 --> 02:33:32.414]  We are going to continue with your phone calls.
[02:33:32.614 --> 02:33:34.956]  Art Acevedo, the police chief, just called us about five minutes ago.
[02:33:34.976 --> 02:33:39.318]  He's running about ten minutes late, so we'll have him part of this hour, a little bit in the next hour.
[02:33:39.959 --> 02:33:41.640]  In overdrive, carried by some stations.
[02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:44.722]  I have a lot of questions for him, so I'm glad he is still coming in.
[02:33:46.687 --> 02:33:58.135]  But continuing here, InfoWars.com is happy to announce the winner of We Will Resist the TSA and NSA Tyranny $10,000 Film Festival.
[02:33:58.955 --> 02:34:02.718]  And you can see that video, Dick Johnson, TSA Wonderkind.
[02:34:03.859 --> 02:34:11.184]  That is the winner up on InfoWars.com, along with Joy Camp and some of the others that were runners-up.
[02:34:12.248 --> 02:34:13.789]  Joy Camp was very, very close.
[02:34:13.809 --> 02:34:19.691]  In fact, we almost had to flip a coin, but good job Joy Camp entering the contest and everybody else that did.
[02:34:20.151 --> 02:34:21.852]  Now, it isn't as good for radio listeners.
[02:34:21.912 --> 02:34:26.994]  It's a tiny bit racy, but we're going to play it and then I'll narrate for radio listeners.
[02:34:27.535 --> 02:34:33.537]  But here's the radio version of Dick Johnson, TSA Wonderkid, the winner of the $10,000 contest.
[02:34:33.557 --> 02:34:33.897]  Here it is.
[02:34:38.283 --> 02:34:40.826]  Dean Wiseman, now they're in the public school.
[02:34:42.107 --> 02:34:42.968]  The mother and the son.
[02:34:42.988 --> 02:34:45.991]  Really good acting, the mother.
[02:34:46.011 --> 02:34:50.115]  Plays like the teenage Bimbo.
[02:34:51.336 --> 02:34:52.717]  Like she had it when she was a teenager, she was like 25.
[02:34:52.837 --> 02:34:57.322]  Now, Mr. Johnson, there's really no easy way to put this.
[02:35:03.072 --> 02:35:03.712]  Your son's a turd.
[02:35:04.633 --> 02:35:05.073]  He cheats.
[02:35:05.594 --> 02:35:06.114]  He lies.
[02:35:06.354 --> 02:35:06.895]  He steals.
[02:35:07.075 --> 02:35:08.155]  He's failing all his classes.
[02:35:08.756 --> 02:35:09.777]  He's a sexual predator.
[02:35:11.077 --> 02:35:12.959]  This kid has no place in this school.
[02:35:12.999 --> 02:35:14.920]  Now, I care about him, okay?
[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:19.983]  But at some point, you're gonna have to sit there and ask yourself, what's he gonna do with his life?
[02:35:20.484 --> 02:35:22.125]  He's not fit for society.
[02:35:22.165 --> 02:35:22.905]  He's out of control.
[02:35:23.546 --> 02:35:25.127]  Oh, come on, Mr. Wiseman.
[02:35:25.547 --> 02:35:27.769]  There's gotta be something this kid can do with his life.
[02:35:30.130 --> 02:35:30.630]  Well, Richard?
[02:35:31.091 --> 02:35:31.251]  Huh?
[02:35:32.981 --> 02:35:34.002]  What do you want to do with your life?
[02:35:34.022 --> 02:35:43.349]  10 years later, 15 years later, he's working at the airport.
[02:35:47.092 --> 02:35:48.193]  Digging through people's bags.
[02:36:06.938 --> 02:36:08.399]  Oh, they found an in-game video.
[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:14.523]  It's not allowed.
[02:36:14.864 --> 02:36:16.325]  So, he's gonna get searched.
[02:36:16.365 --> 02:36:17.706]  Don't complain.
[02:36:17.786 --> 02:36:20.688]  Complaining will get you put in prison.
[02:36:29.687 --> 02:36:34.710]  I'm not joking when you get put through as a terrorist while the government runs Al-Qaeda publicly.
[02:36:34.730 --> 02:36:35.671]  TSA searching everybody.
[02:36:35.711 --> 02:36:36.932]  He's bored, doing nothing.
[02:36:37.552 --> 02:36:40.394]  At least he's a good-looking woman.
[02:36:40.614 --> 02:36:42.355]  This guy's being waved through as a rifle.
[02:36:42.415 --> 02:36:51.881]  He's a good-looking senorita.
[02:36:51.921 --> 02:36:57.444]  They got the naked body scanners.
[02:37:12.725 --> 02:37:13.766]  Got the trendy mustache.
[02:37:15.007 --> 02:37:17.228]  Plus the good looking woman in the naked body scanner.
[02:37:17.429 --> 02:37:22.032]  They're on record by the way, looking at that.
[02:37:22.072 --> 02:37:26.875]  They're on record and they print out copies and save it.
[02:37:27.055 --> 02:37:32.019]  They make fun of people's genitals.
[02:37:32.079 --> 02:37:34.361]  He's got his plastic glove on.
[02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:40.412]  We're gonna have to do a search of her.
[02:37:40.632 --> 02:37:42.753]  Now, what it really gets into is the pre-screening.
[02:37:42.773 --> 02:37:44.374]  When you're at home.
[02:37:44.854 --> 02:37:45.895]  JIT JOHNSON!
[02:37:46.615 --> 02:37:47.696]  TSA Wonderkind.
[02:37:47.716 --> 02:37:47.776]  Mhm.
[02:37:53.819 --> 02:37:55.960]  Got a guy at home on his computer buying plane tickets.
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:56.220]  Alright, sis.
[02:37:59.281 --> 02:37:59.541]  Done.
[02:38:00.622 --> 02:38:02.563]  Alright, I'll be flying out on the 23rd.
[02:38:02.583 --> 02:38:04.604]  Be landing around 2pm.
[02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.290]  Okay.
[02:38:07.310 --> 02:38:07.931]  I love you too, sis.
[02:38:07.951 --> 02:38:09.971]  Alright, bye.
[02:38:10.132 --> 02:38:10.812]  Pre-crime!
[02:38:12.792 --> 02:38:13.713]  Everything's surveilled.
[02:38:14.433 --> 02:38:14.993]  Hello, Michael.
[02:38:15.073 --> 02:38:15.393]  What the?
[02:38:20.535 --> 02:38:21.115]  Who are you?
[02:38:21.135 --> 02:38:25.777]  My name is Dick Johnson, and I'm just your friendly TSA field agent.
[02:38:26.818 --> 02:38:30.559]  I'm just here to conduct a little pre-security screening.
[02:38:33.418 --> 02:38:34.179]  He's rubbing on him.
[02:38:34.199 --> 02:38:36.100]  Wait, how did you even know I was flying?
[02:38:37.942 --> 02:38:38.522]  Oh, Mikey.
[02:38:38.542 --> 02:38:39.623]  Don't call me that.
[02:38:40.003 --> 02:38:48.930]  I know our essays at the NSA aren't as sexy or memorable as those of us at the TSA.
[02:38:50.231 --> 02:38:51.332]  But surely you've heard of them?
[02:38:52.318 --> 02:38:53.679]  Because I know they heard of you!
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:58.144]  They had me on my way over here the minute you googled cheaper airfare.
[02:38:59.385 --> 02:39:01.667]  And why did they send you?
[02:39:02.007 --> 02:39:07.593]  Well, I'm part of a new TSA initiative to screen certain high-risk travelers.
[02:39:07.753 --> 02:39:08.554]  That's not even true.
[02:39:08.574 --> 02:39:14.239]  They're mainlining everybody going into a database as an excuse to datamine and to mainline NSA spying.
[02:39:14.259 --> 02:39:14.760]  That's all it is.
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:24.304]  You're a white, gun-owning, twenty-something Christian man who wrote in Ron Paul in two elections and has a house positively chock-full of anti-government propaganda.
[02:39:25.244 --> 02:39:28.466]  So, since you fit the domestic terrorist profile to a T,
[02:39:29.485 --> 02:39:35.187]  The lovely folks at the TSA just wanted me to come down here so I can make sure that you're safe to travel.
[02:39:35.848 --> 02:39:39.829]  Now, I assure you, this will make the process at the airport much smoother.
[02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:43.431]  And if everything checks out, you won't even have to do a cavity search there.
[02:39:43.791 --> 02:39:44.771]  Oh, that's good.
[02:39:45.112 --> 02:39:50.094]  Yeah, we're just gonna go ahead and take care of that right here in the privacy and convenience of your own bathroom.
[02:39:50.214 --> 02:39:50.454]  What?
[02:39:50.714 --> 02:39:52.875]  But first I just have just a few questions, okay?
[02:39:54.776 --> 02:39:57.397]  What is your business in, uh,
[02:39:59.388 --> 02:39:59.989]  Albuquerque.
[02:40:01.651 --> 02:40:03.472]  And are you smuggling meth for Heisenberg?
[02:40:04.914 --> 02:40:05.635]  Uh, no.
[02:40:06.255 --> 02:40:08.718]  You realize that's just a TV show, right?
[02:40:08.738 --> 02:40:10.540]  Then what is your business there?
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:14.003]  I'm actually going there to see my sister.
[02:40:15.885 --> 02:40:16.706]  She's got cancer.
[02:40:16.726 --> 02:40:18.047]  No.
[02:40:18.668 --> 02:40:19.769]  They don't know if she's gonna make it.
[02:40:26.843 --> 02:40:28.567]  Where did your sister get radioactive materials?
[02:40:28.807 --> 02:40:30.591]  And where is she planning on detonating that dirty bomb?
[02:40:30.771 --> 02:40:33.257]  Dude, what the... Dick Johnson!
[02:40:34.399 --> 02:40:35.962]  Next time, on Dick Johnson.
[02:40:48.672 --> 02:41:00.317]  Literally, folks, all it is is an excuse for the power structure to power grab and list us all as criminals so that they can steal all of our data and use it against us.
[02:41:01.437 --> 02:41:02.318]  That's what's going on.
[02:41:02.458 --> 02:41:05.639]  And by every benchmark, this is a tyrannical system.
[02:41:06.219 --> 02:41:10.281]  Look at how they lied to you about Obamacare when the bill said they'd take money out of your bank account.
[02:41:12.090 --> 02:41:17.653]  $5,000 penalties and interest if you didn't get Obamacare and they said, oh that's not in there and now they admit it's in there and the IRS is implementing it.
[02:41:17.933 --> 02:41:22.295]  They didn't hire 17,000 agents to implement that for no reason.
[02:41:23.336 --> 02:41:27.818]  They did that because that was the plan and that's now been announced today.
[02:41:28.959 --> 02:41:36.443]  So the answer is speak out against it, say no to it, expose the giant stinking fraud that it is.
[02:41:38.038 --> 02:41:41.100]  In fact, our article on this just went up that integrates all the news together.
[02:41:41.561 --> 02:41:45.484]  IRS prepared to enforce Obamacare with fines and fees.
[02:41:45.984 --> 02:41:52.489]  Harry Reid and the Democrats are determined to shove this historical monstrosity down your throat.
[02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:57.092]  And talk about a reign of terror.
[02:41:58.873 --> 02:42:00.735]  They call it the shared responsibility.
[02:42:02.676 --> 02:42:03.497]  Absolutely
[02:42:05.287 --> 02:42:09.169]  Totally disgusting that they denied this all those times.
[02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:12.151]  And then now, there it is in your face.
[02:42:12.551 --> 02:42:18.414]  But the IRS is the enforcers of all this new social engineering.
[02:42:18.434 --> 02:42:20.135]  And I gotta tell you, it's very, very fitting.
[02:42:21.616 --> 02:42:22.316]  Very, very fitting.
[02:42:26.098 --> 02:42:30.020]  That it's the IRS they're gonna have carrying all this out.
[02:42:30.701 --> 02:42:34.623]  Let's go ahead and talk to BernankeIsABomb.
[02:42:36.101 --> 02:42:36.822]  I have another caller.
[02:42:36.862 --> 02:42:38.003]  Obama is a scumbag.
[02:42:38.043 --> 02:42:38.923]  Hillary is a whore.
[02:42:38.943 --> 02:42:39.584]  I mean, excuse me.
[02:42:39.944 --> 02:42:40.845]  Hillary is a witch.
[02:42:40.945 --> 02:42:41.525]  Be more accurate.
[02:42:42.486 --> 02:42:43.046]  Uh, let's go.
[02:42:43.066 --> 02:42:43.907]  She whores us out.
[02:42:43.947 --> 02:42:44.267]  I'm sorry.
[02:42:44.487 --> 02:42:45.328]  Hillary is a pimp.
[02:42:46.289 --> 02:42:48.871]  Uh, Bernanke is a bum from Washington State.
[02:42:49.291 --> 02:42:50.272]  You're on the air, terrorist.
[02:42:50.332 --> 02:42:52.974]  Go ahead.
[02:42:54.034 --> 02:42:54.475]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:42:54.495 --> 02:42:55.415]  Your phone's breaking up a bit.
[02:42:56.196 --> 02:42:56.957]  Oh, sorry about that.
[02:42:57.437 --> 02:42:59.539]  Uh, that video would be funny if it wasn't so true.
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:05.103]  Yeah, it seems like there's no level of humiliation they won't put us through.
[02:43:06.018 --> 02:43:07.740]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:16.687]  Talking about Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act, it seems like it's about 5 million knuckleheads that have lost their health care at this point.
[02:43:18.089 --> 02:43:18.329]  Yes.
[02:43:19.150 --> 02:43:19.790]  I mean people.
[02:43:19.970 --> 02:43:20.451]  I'm sorry.
[02:43:21.873 --> 02:43:23.174]  It just amazes me.
[02:43:23.574 --> 02:43:26.716]  And they were shooting for like 2.8 million sign-ups.
[02:43:26.757 --> 02:43:29.919]  They got 3.3 and lost 5 million people.
[02:43:29.979 --> 02:43:31.020]  Now how does that add up?
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:32.341]  It's all pure bull.
[02:43:33.102 --> 02:43:35.484]  What do you make of the bill saying the IRS would take the money?
[02:43:36.204 --> 02:43:38.746]  And they go, oh no, no, no, no, and now they're doing it.
[02:43:39.006 --> 02:43:41.348]  Of course the IRS was going to take the money.
[02:43:41.949 --> 02:43:44.070]  It's the level of lying.
[02:43:44.491 --> 02:43:46.893]  And where is the Republican leadership repealing this?
[02:43:47.742 --> 02:43:49.063]  Yeah, I totally expected it.
[02:43:49.083 --> 02:43:53.966]  I mean, when they started taking money from the banks in Europe, I mean, I was listening to you.
[02:43:54.006 --> 02:43:56.648]  I mean, you warned us all ahead of time, but I mean, I knew it was coming.
[02:43:56.708 --> 02:43:59.950]  It was just a matter of when and how they were going to put that into place.
[02:44:00.610 --> 02:44:02.451]  Of course, Obamacare is a perfect way to do it.
[02:44:03.812 --> 02:44:10.076]  On a second note, this crap, if I can say crap, this crap that's going on in Connecticut
[02:44:10.822 --> 02:44:12.884]  Are you going to put any ample warriors up there?
[02:44:12.904 --> 02:44:15.507]  Are you going to put any protesters up there?
[02:44:15.867 --> 02:44:20.212]  Anybody holding signs to try to wake people up to what's actually going on there?
[02:44:21.581 --> 02:44:28.427]  Well, for those that don't know, the article is up on InfoWars.com from last night in the most popular section.
[02:44:29.047 --> 02:44:33.130]  The headline is, Surrender Your Firearms, Connecticut Tells Unregistered Gun Owners.
[02:44:33.651 --> 02:44:36.973]  The state didn't even set up ways for people to, quote, register them.
[02:44:37.334 --> 02:44:38.335]  People did it by mail.
[02:44:38.355 --> 02:44:44.199]  They're getting letters back saying, no, turn in all your semi-automatic firearms and we're not going to let you register them.
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:46.841]  And the letter is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:47.382 --> 02:44:48.243]  It's unprecedented.
[02:44:49.011 --> 02:44:51.953]  And it just shows that they do want our guns and they will take them.
[02:44:52.613 --> 02:44:56.616]  And I told the crew I want them to go up and cover that Urban Warfare Training Center.
[02:44:57.765 --> 02:45:00.066]  And so I'm going to get the reporters to go up and cover that.
[02:45:00.546 --> 02:45:03.506]  The Army never returned our phone calls, but that doesn't mean we're not going to go up there.
[02:45:04.367 --> 02:45:08.928]  And that's in Virginia, and we should go up to Connecticut and show the gun confiscation.
[02:45:09.148 --> 02:45:16.230]  My issue is I've only got like four reporters, and I don't have the infrastructure or the money right now to constantly send everybody everywhere.
[02:45:16.250 --> 02:45:21.211]  I mean, gun owners up there should be up in arms politically to reverse this.
[02:45:21.331 --> 02:45:22.891]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:45:23.272 --> 02:45:24.192]  I appreciate your call.
[02:45:25.583 --> 02:45:28.064]  People should at least get this article out to everybody, bare minimum.
[02:45:28.804 --> 02:45:30.505]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick in Utah.
[02:45:30.525 --> 02:45:30.885]  Go ahead.
[02:45:32.286 --> 02:45:33.086]  Hey Alex, you there?
[02:45:33.466 --> 02:45:33.846]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:34.987 --> 02:45:39.828]  Yeah, actually, I just wanted to remind you about Mike Lee up here.
[02:45:40.229 --> 02:45:43.110]  He is trying to repeal Obamacare.
[02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:48.352]  And of course, he was the one that led the pipe truck defund it in the first place.
[02:45:49.674 --> 02:45:56.776]  There's a lot of great video on YouTube with Mike Lee and the argument about Obamacare, and there's a really great one.
[02:45:56.836 --> 02:46:05.898]  It's listed here as Obama's crack pipe, but there's some great videos on that.
[02:46:06.019 --> 02:46:07.619]  And then I had one other comment.
[02:46:08.311 --> 02:46:11.974]  The guy that was saying, well, what do we do?
[02:46:12.474 --> 02:46:17.478]  And I agree, you're the info warrior, the guy that gives us that information.
[02:46:17.999 --> 02:46:26.285]  Once we have that information, then we need to take it to our congressmen, our senators, and start getting politically involved in our local governments.
[02:46:26.305 --> 02:46:33.390]  And that's actually what I've done, is I've sat down and talked with our congressmen and our senator.
[02:46:33.450 --> 02:46:35.292]  Grant, they only give you 15 minutes, but
[02:46:35.894 --> 02:46:39.696]  Hey, if you can get 15 minutes in front of a congressman, it's better than... Exactly!
[02:46:39.736 --> 02:46:44.658]  When they go out to these meet and greets, when they go around everywhere, you tell them, how dare you not repeal this?
[02:46:44.718 --> 02:46:46.579]  How dare you not take action against it?
[02:46:46.879 --> 02:46:47.459]  Thank you, Rick.
[02:46:47.779 --> 02:46:49.380]  Jerome in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:46:50.721 --> 02:46:55.503]  Yes, Alex, this is Jerome in Austin, Texas, and I have a couple things I want to talk about.
[02:46:55.643 --> 02:46:57.183]  One thing is Obamacare.
[02:46:58.404 --> 02:47:01.445]  I'm recently retired from the motion picture business.
[02:47:01.585 --> 02:47:04.527]  I was in entertainment at Universal Studios for 20 years.
[02:47:05.854 --> 02:47:06.996]  Hey, I'm not ignoring you.
[02:47:07.036 --> 02:47:10.381]  The police chief just stormed the office with a SWAT team.
[02:47:10.401 --> 02:47:11.342]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:47:11.783 --> 02:47:17.832]  Hey, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo is in here with us right now and he's come to confiscate the guns.
[02:47:19.117 --> 02:47:20.598]  I am all for the Second Amendment.
[02:47:20.738 --> 02:47:23.161]  Every time I'm here, I have to get that out of the way.
[02:47:23.181 --> 02:47:24.122]  I'm just teasing you.
[02:47:24.582 --> 02:47:26.344]  Anyways, how's everything going?
[02:47:27.124 --> 02:47:27.345]  Good.
[02:47:27.885 --> 02:47:32.269]  We haven't had any controversy in the last 24 hours, so it's a good morning so far.
[02:47:32.770 --> 02:47:39.697]  I ran into a police officer the other day that said he works at night and you were out at 2 o'clock in the morning doing calls with him.
[02:47:40.277 --> 02:47:42.399]  I do that on a regular basis, yeah.
[02:47:42.439 --> 02:47:43.620]  I worked Saturday night.
[02:47:43.780 --> 02:47:50.204]  I was supposed to stay out until about 3, but it was so busy, I really didn't get home until 6 in the morning.
[02:47:50.905 --> 02:47:54.948]  You have made international news with your comment.
[02:47:54.988 --> 02:47:56.089]  We have a clip of it.
[02:47:56.349 --> 02:47:58.090]  Here, you don't have headphones, but you know what you said.
[02:47:58.110 --> 02:48:01.593]  I actually played this earlier and said, really what you're saying is kind of true.
[02:48:02.253 --> 02:48:06.456]  You know, at least the police here aren't raping people with toilet plungers or raping women.
[02:48:07.477 --> 02:48:12.600]  But there you're admitting, though, that in North Korea and Mexico and Nigeria, the police are not too good.
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:17.523]  Listen, police is imperfect everywhere in the world because the human condition is imperfect.
[02:48:17.603 --> 02:48:31.032]  And, you know, I wish I could go back and take back that analogy because people that want to hate on the police, that want to create more mistrust of the police, have turned that into, at least she wasn't raped, which is absolutely not what was not on my mind.
[02:48:31.052 --> 02:48:31.653]  That is not
[02:48:32.173 --> 02:48:34.255]  What I meant, but, you know, it is what it is.
[02:48:34.275 --> 02:48:37.678]  No, no, in fairness, I actually agree with what you said, but I can see how they took it out of context.
[02:48:37.938 --> 02:48:41.841]  You're saying, hey, usually it's a controversy of rape or corruption.
[02:48:41.901 --> 02:48:46.245]  I mean, at least this is just them, you know, taking a woman to jail.
[02:48:46.665 --> 02:48:49.888]  Listen, there's a lot of misconceived notions of what happened there.
[02:48:49.928 --> 02:48:52.990]  This was, people saw a lady just sitting there screaming on top.
[02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:56.073]  All that video shows is a young lady sitting down,
[02:48:56.773 --> 02:48:57.274]  Screaming.
[02:48:57.734 --> 02:48:58.435]  Using profanity.
[02:48:58.455 --> 02:49:02.300]  For those that don't know, she was jogging and couldn't couldn't hear them saying stop.
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:07.506]  Well, well, she passed, and officers, we don't, we weren't there to write tickets.
[02:49:07.526 --> 02:49:10.049]  We were there to try to get these young people to make better choices.
[02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:15.616]  We had, within a couple of hours of that incident, we had another young lady, or male, I don't remember if it was a man or a woman,
[02:49:16.297 --> 02:49:18.600]  Go across the street in front of a bus, got hit by a bus.
[02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:19.981]  The next day we had three more people.
[02:49:20.001 --> 02:49:24.827]  It is true that the bikes and pedestrians do run out in front of cars all day downtown.
[02:49:24.967 --> 02:49:25.508]  It's crazy.
[02:49:25.668 --> 02:49:31.175]  And so the bottom line is she did not get arrested for carrying an I.I.D.
[02:49:31.215 --> 02:49:32.656]  You don't have to carry an I.I.D.
[02:49:32.676 --> 02:49:36.080]  in the state of Texas when you're a pedestrian or when you're riding your bike.
[02:49:36.721 --> 02:49:45.124]  But, if the officers are going to write you a ticket, you have to say who you are so they can write you the ticket, you can sign your promise to appear, and you're on your way.
[02:49:45.164 --> 02:49:46.424]  The answer is like the Running Man.
[02:49:46.464 --> 02:49:51.006]  If we all wore explosive necklaces, when she didn't stop, they'd just blow her head off.
[02:49:51.206 --> 02:49:57.168]  No, we, that's not... No, no, no, the NSA, the TSA, is actually looking at Taser bracelets to fly.
[02:49:57.708 --> 02:49:59.929]  Would you like to put a Taser bracelet on yourself?
[02:50:00.209 --> 02:50:03.270]  No, I'm not sure that I'd be very interested in that at all.
[02:50:03.410 --> 02:50:09.072]  Why not have explosives at birth planted in the brain so if the government's mad at you, they just hit a button like Snake Plissken?
[02:50:09.392 --> 02:50:09.892]  God, I love you.
[02:50:09.932 --> 02:50:11.153]  Have you seen Escape from New York?
[02:50:11.233 --> 02:50:13.034]  Yeah, that's one of my favorite movies.
[02:50:13.094 --> 02:50:13.794]  I love that movie.
[02:50:14.274 --> 02:50:15.234]  That's a great movie.
[02:50:15.635 --> 02:50:17.255]  The original, I didn't like Escape from L.A.
[02:50:17.275 --> 02:50:17.975]  No, Escape from L.A.
[02:50:18.015 --> 02:50:18.656]  wasn't that good.
[02:50:18.776 --> 02:50:20.356]  But it's been too long.
[02:50:20.396 --> 02:50:20.957]  I miss you guys.
[02:50:20.977 --> 02:50:22.257]  Hey, talk about yourself a little bit.
[02:50:22.497 --> 02:50:29.400]  Your dad worked for the CIA in gun running against Fidel Castro, and now you work to get the guns here in America.
[02:50:30.680 --> 02:50:32.582]  First of all, let me just say this, make it real clear.
[02:50:33.062 --> 02:50:35.604]  I will never support a gun control.
[02:50:35.704 --> 02:50:37.005]  I don't think that that's the answer.
[02:50:37.825 --> 02:50:46.231]  For me, it's more important to ensure that we do what we can to keep guns in the hands of law-abiding Americans of sound mind.
[02:50:46.351 --> 02:50:49.874]  And it's not about a different weapon system.
[02:50:49.934 --> 02:50:52.495]  It's about making sure we do our best to keep them in the right hands.
[02:50:52.516 --> 02:50:54.137]  And that's law-abiding people.
[02:50:54.197 --> 02:50:55.978]  People that aren't crazy and people that aren't felons.
[02:50:56.158 --> 02:50:58.440]  Alright, now I've got you for another 15 minutes or so.
[02:50:58.541 --> 02:50:58.901]  That's it?
[02:50:58.941 --> 02:51:00.162]  No, no, we appreciate you coming.
[02:51:00.202 --> 02:51:01.564]  You can stay longer if you want.
[02:51:01.584 --> 02:51:02.144]  I want to stay longer.
[02:51:02.164 --> 02:51:03.045]  We're going into overdrive.
[02:51:03.065 --> 02:51:04.046]  I want my full hour.
[02:51:04.307 --> 02:51:05.047]  Your full hour?
[02:51:05.148 --> 02:51:05.708]  I want my full hour.
[02:51:05.728 --> 02:51:06.449]  I look like a hippie.
[02:51:06.509 --> 02:51:07.610]  I'm supposed to get a haircut at 3.
[02:51:08.031 --> 02:51:08.611]  That's okay.
[02:51:08.751 --> 02:51:09.873]  I am turned into a hippie.
[02:51:09.893 --> 02:51:10.393]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:11.474 --> 02:51:14.255]  Will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[02:51:14.395 --> 02:51:16.836]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored.
[02:51:16.976 --> 02:51:21.657]  And more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[02:51:21.817 --> 02:51:25.779]  PRI Fuel Stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[02:51:25.919 --> 02:51:31.840]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at sea rely on PRI Fuel Stabilizers.
[02:51:31.980 --> 02:51:32.701]  And you can too!
[02:51:32.721 --> 02:51:34.621]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit priproducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[02:51:41.314 --> 02:51:42.715]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[02:51:42.835 --> 02:51:45.516]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[02:51:45.676 --> 02:51:50.338]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[02:51:50.518 --> 02:51:55.700]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.
[02:51:55.840 --> 02:52:02.442]  My Magic Mud is a soft powder that polishes your teeth, reduces sensitivity, and removes harmful toxins from deep inside your mouth.

[02:53:09.892 --> 02:53:13.214]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:53:13.314 --> 02:53:15.535]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:53:15.715 --> 02:53:23.959]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:53:24.239 --> 02:53:37.025]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:53:37.245 --> 02:53:48.054]  And then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:53:48.454 --> 02:53:54.520]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:53:54.740 --> 02:54:03.307]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[02:54:03.427 --> 02:54:07.370]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality.

[02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:26.743]  Robocop brings us in.
[02:54:26.763 --> 02:54:29.925]  Maybe Artie Cervantes, the awesome police chief, is really a robot.
[02:54:31.075 --> 02:54:31.776]  Are you a robot?
[02:54:44.847 --> 02:54:51.551]  Hey seriously though, we have the clip of you talking about this woman that got arrested for not stopping when she ran across the street jaywalking.
[02:54:52.132 --> 02:54:59.256]  It's not jaywalking, jaywalking is mid-block, it was for crossing against the red, not obeying a traffic control.
[02:54:59.276 --> 02:55:00.937]  Oh, so crossing across the red, okay.
[02:55:01.058 --> 02:55:01.218]  Yeah.
[02:55:03.439 --> 02:55:10.185]  Here is the clip that's gone nationwide from Japan to England of him saying at least our officers aren't raping people.
[02:55:10.225 --> 02:55:10.585]  Here it is.
[02:55:10.746 --> 02:55:12.127]  That's not what I said, but that's okay.
[02:55:12.147 --> 02:55:20.474]  In Austin, Texas, we actually had the audacity to touch somebody by the arm and tell them, oh my goodness, Austin police, we're trying to get your attention.
[02:55:21.595 --> 02:55:24.798]  In other cities, cops are actually committing sexual assaults on duty.
[02:55:24.838 --> 02:55:30.163]  So I thank God that this is what passes for a controversy in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:30.663 --> 02:55:32.985]  So in other cities, they're actually having sexual assaults.
[02:55:33.366 --> 02:55:35.167]  You're glad that this passes as a controversy?
[02:55:35.347 --> 02:55:47.478]  Well, listen, I would never, it breaks my heart in the time of instant information, any time a police officer falls short or on the globe because we're all painted with the same white brush.
[02:55:48.219 --> 02:55:52.783]  And it was a bad analogy because I knew, I didn't know at the time, but it ended up being twisted.
[02:55:53.644 --> 02:56:01.066]  But, you know, Austin, less about points of reference, Austin is such a great city, and our department is such a good department.
[02:56:01.086 --> 02:56:04.767]  Well, I've been all over the country, I have to say, the police are nicer in Austin than almost every other city.
[02:56:04.787 --> 02:56:05.167]  Well, thanks.
[02:56:05.387 --> 02:56:06.547]  And in the big cities.
[02:56:06.827 --> 02:56:08.028]  In the small cities, they're usually pretty nice.
[02:56:08.088 --> 02:56:15.009]  And Alex, over the years, you've been a soldier for InfoWars, and you've confronted our cops, and they've never really put their hands on you.
[02:56:15.029 --> 02:56:18.330]  They've always been pretty professional, even before I got here.
[02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:19.751]  I've seen a lot of the videos.
[02:56:21.311 --> 02:56:23.434]  You know, the frustration for me is this.
[02:56:23.695 --> 02:56:25.818]  I hold my cops to a very high standard.
[02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:32.107]  Our officers here get fired for things and in a lot of departments they don't, and then this is the controversy?
[02:56:32.448 --> 02:56:35.272]  You don't get the option of opting out of a ticket
[02:56:36.994 --> 02:56:38.515]  By refusing to give your name.
[02:56:38.575 --> 02:56:43.397]  I hear you, but here is the controversy, and we're going to bring in the new Molon Labe women's shirt for your wife.
[02:56:43.417 --> 02:56:46.079]  Would you like a come and take it, a 300 shirt?
[02:56:46.259 --> 02:56:47.920]  Well, this is what it looks like.
[02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:48.640]  We've got it.
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:49.221]  Bring it in here.
[02:56:49.841 --> 02:56:51.041]  The gold shirts, folks.
[02:56:51.402 --> 02:56:52.862]  Ladies and gentlemen, Arte Cerveda.
[02:56:52.902 --> 02:56:53.523]  Let's get a shot.
[02:56:53.803 --> 02:56:54.403]  Hold it up there.
[02:56:54.463 --> 02:56:56.544]  Product placement with the Austin Police Chief.
[02:56:56.564 --> 02:56:57.365]  Hold it in front of the camera.
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:56:59.140]  Camera's right over here.
[02:56:59.180 --> 02:56:59.421]  See?
[02:56:59.441 --> 02:56:59.761]  Right there.
[02:57:00.081 --> 02:57:01.481]  And does that not look good or what?
[02:57:01.661 --> 02:57:02.362]  Yeah, let's take the 300.
[02:57:02.402 --> 02:57:04.643]  Yeah, and it's got the M4's cross there.
[02:57:04.663 --> 02:57:05.643]  You think your wife will like that?
[02:57:06.283 --> 02:57:07.184]  Is that the right size for her?
[02:57:07.204 --> 02:57:09.105]  Yeah, that's fine.
[02:57:09.125 --> 02:57:09.985]  You got any daughters?
[02:57:10.005 --> 02:57:10.605]  What about daughters?
[02:57:11.085 --> 02:57:14.087]  Uh, we've got a Sabana out there that would love one.
[02:57:14.127 --> 02:57:14.747]  Let's give her one.
[02:57:14.767 --> 02:57:15.447]  Bring her in here.
[02:57:15.467 --> 02:57:17.248]  Bring your assistant in here.
[02:57:17.568 --> 02:57:20.789]  The lovely, lovely police chief assistant.
[02:57:21.010 --> 02:57:21.630]  She won't come in.
[02:57:21.650 --> 02:57:22.630]  Come on in here.
[02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:24.371]  We're gonna give it to her though.
[02:57:24.471 --> 02:57:25.051]  Yeah, give it to her.
[02:57:25.071 --> 02:57:26.092]  Come on!
[02:57:26.572 --> 02:57:28.033]  Available at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:57:28.514 --> 02:57:29.674]  Helps fund the operation.
[02:57:30.075 --> 02:57:30.995]  Hey, you see the new studio?
[02:57:31.015 --> 02:57:31.355]  You like it?
[02:57:31.516 --> 02:57:33.137]  It is fantastic.
[02:57:33.297 --> 02:57:33.937]  It's phenomenal.
[02:57:33.957 --> 02:57:35.058]  I was too busy to ever launch it.
[02:57:35.458 --> 02:57:36.259]  Well, when are you going to launch it?
[02:57:36.459 --> 02:57:37.199]  That's really small.
[02:57:37.219 --> 02:57:37.980]  That's like a small one.
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.101]  I'm going to launch it in the next couple of weeks.
[02:57:40.121 --> 02:57:41.582]  We've got a bunch of cable systems ready to pick it up.
[02:57:41.782 --> 02:57:42.663]  Let me ask you a serious question.
[02:57:42.743 --> 02:57:50.008]  I heard you a few months ago on the morning show with Sergeant Sam say, quote, follow police orders even if you think they're unlawful and you won't get hurt.
[02:57:50.828 --> 02:58:00.034]  Well, I mean, if you look at police officers generally, and I can speak to 20 years of experience, generally are responding to the actions of somebody.
[02:58:00.054 --> 02:58:02.795]  That's why our use of force policy is called response to resistance.
[02:58:03.896 --> 02:58:07.958]  I tell my kids, you don't fight a battle with the cops on the street.
[02:58:08.098 --> 02:58:13.942]  If you've been mistreated or you think you were falsely arrested or the ticket's not valid, there's a process to do that.
[02:58:14.062 --> 02:58:18.285]  And so I always tell them is that we take our grievances through the courts.
[02:58:18.925 --> 02:58:38.929]  through the police monitors office for internal affairs but you just don't do it on the street and you know it really sads me when I see folks running from the police you know they get themselves hurt over over silly violations and in Austin Texas don't you know might get you a slap on the wrist and you're putting yourself at risk running it's just
[02:58:39.589 --> 02:58:41.912]  Or it might get you shot in the back.
[02:58:41.992 --> 02:58:46.977]  Well, you know, I mean, nothing good comes from running from the police when they're on foot.
[02:58:46.997 --> 02:58:50.600]  I'll tell you what, back in 60 seconds, let's continue there with Police Chief Arne Cerveda.
[02:58:50.680 --> 02:58:54.564]  Overdrive, InfoWars.com, Fort Sly Show, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:54.584 --> 02:58:54.984]  Stay with us.
[02:59:00.094 --> 02:59:00.935]  The facts are in.
[02:59:01.115 --> 02:59:02.236]  The studies are legion.
[02:59:02.516 --> 02:59:09.883]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:59:10.043 --> 02:59:13.506]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:59:13.866 --> 02:59:14.267]  Simple.
[02:59:14.447 --> 02:59:18.811]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:59:19.151 --> 02:59:24.616]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:59:24.856 --> 02:59:30.261]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live fluoride shield formulation.
[02:59:30.421 --> 02:59:40.931]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:59:41.211 --> 02:59:45.415]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[02:59:45.755 --> 02:59:47.616]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[02:59:47.917 --> 02:59:53.220]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:59:53.480 --> 02:59:57.723]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:59:57.883 --> 02:59:59.764]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:00:01.025 --> 03:00:02.206]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:02.566 --> 03:00:04.007]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:04.607 --> 03:00:07.829]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.963 --> 03:00:19.125]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:19.806 --> 03:00:20.606]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.387 --> 03:00:22.267]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.947 --> 03:00:26.569]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:27.130 --> 03:00:31.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:44.321 --> 03:00:47.304]  Hey, I tell ya, you have got like a bodyguard in here today.
[03:00:47.384 --> 03:00:48.906]  You don't usually bring three people.
[03:00:49.186 --> 03:00:49.627]  You know what?
[03:00:49.867 --> 03:00:52.730]  They were at lunch and we were running late, so they picked me up to bring me here.
[03:00:52.930 --> 03:00:53.591]  Oh, well that's good.
[03:00:53.651 --> 03:00:53.891]  Yeah.
[03:00:54.111 --> 03:00:55.953]  No, actually, they're actually fans.
[03:00:56.033 --> 03:00:58.276]  Why are those guys carrying Barrett 50 Cals out there?
[03:00:59.875 --> 03:01:01.576]  It's to protect you, not to protect the show.
[03:01:01.597 --> 03:01:02.577]  Hey, that's an idea.
[03:01:02.597 --> 03:01:04.599]  You want to come out to the real Steiner Ranch, 12,000 acres.
[03:01:04.619 --> 03:01:06.641]  We already talked about it, and you still haven't invited me.
[03:01:06.661 --> 03:01:07.261]  Okay, fine.
[03:01:07.301 --> 03:01:08.182]  But you want to follow through.
[03:01:08.222 --> 03:01:12.485]  My buddy Shane Steiner, Sid Steiner, I will take you to the real Steiner Ranch, and we'll shoot 50 cows.
[03:01:12.806 --> 03:01:13.486]  Okay, anytime.
[03:01:13.526 --> 03:01:19.031]  And we'll wait until someday where it's rained real hard so we can shoot up old trucks and stuff with the tracer rounds.
[03:01:20.309 --> 03:01:21.570]  It looks like a photon torpedo.
[03:01:21.590 --> 03:01:22.670]  You ever shot a 50 cal tracer?
[03:01:23.131 --> 03:01:23.571]  No, I have not.
[03:01:23.591 --> 03:01:24.231]  It's pretty awesome.
[03:01:24.371 --> 03:01:25.012]  Okay, yeah.
[03:01:25.052 --> 03:01:26.472]  You said that last year when I came by.
[03:01:26.492 --> 03:01:26.993]  That's it!
[03:01:27.013 --> 03:01:27.553]  We're gonna do it!
[03:01:27.593 --> 03:01:28.033]  Yeah, okay.
[03:01:28.173 --> 03:01:28.393]  Alright.
[03:01:28.413 --> 03:01:29.294]  You didn't even answer a phone call.
[03:01:29.314 --> 03:01:31.355]  We're gonna have like cutouts of Austin citizens?
[03:01:31.635 --> 03:01:32.456]  No, come on.
[03:01:32.496 --> 03:01:33.516]  That's not... I'm just joking.
[03:01:33.756 --> 03:01:38.079]  Did you see the Homeland Security no hesitation targets of like little kids and stuff?
[03:01:38.599 --> 03:01:39.479]  No, I have not seen that.
[03:01:39.499 --> 03:01:40.360]  I have not seen that.
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:44.082]  What do you think about police departments getting these giant armored vehicles from Iraq?
[03:01:45.604 --> 03:01:49.727]  Um, we don't have one, uh, problem with, you like the MRAPs and stuff like that?
[03:01:49.767 --> 03:01:49.967]  Yes.
[03:01:50.247 --> 03:01:53.349]  They're just, uh, how do you operate those in small city streets?
[03:01:53.369 --> 03:01:55.191]  We're not interested in them here.
[03:01:55.751 --> 03:02:01.015]  We don't think they're conducive to a small, to the environment that we're in here in Austin.
[03:02:01.355 --> 03:02:04.197]  But what kind of vehicles do you have that are somewhat bullet resistant?
[03:02:04.457 --> 03:02:09.520]  Uh, we have some of our SWAT vehicles, uh, that, uh, a couple of them, but that's all we need.
[03:02:10.101 --> 03:02:10.861]  Nothing that big.
[03:02:10.961 --> 03:02:14.344]  It's, you know, we're not worried about those things.
[03:02:15.407 --> 03:02:17.649]  Well, you know, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[03:02:17.729 --> 03:02:18.569]  So much is going on.
[03:02:19.150 --> 03:02:21.211]  Here's my issue I raise from Constitution.org.
[03:02:21.531 --> 03:02:31.638]  Your right to self-defense against unlawful arrest, and then it goes through all the federal and state rulings about the right to not go along with an unlawful arrest.
[03:02:32.078 --> 03:02:37.522]  What about these cases now where the police just come in people's houses without warrants when there's not like a woman screaming
[03:02:37.782 --> 03:02:38.843]  And there's not a probable cause.
[03:02:38.863 --> 03:02:40.363]  When there's no exigency, you mean?
[03:02:40.744 --> 03:02:40.944]  Yeah.
[03:02:41.144 --> 03:02:41.344]  Right.
[03:02:41.884 --> 03:02:42.785]  Well, that's illegal.
[03:02:42.805 --> 03:02:47.707]  You cannot go into a home without probable cause, without a warrant, or without some exigency.
[03:02:47.787 --> 03:02:54.111]  And so that's something for a matter for the courts to resolve if that happens to somebody.
[03:02:55.592 --> 03:02:57.913]  About a month ago, the kids were over at my parents' house.
[03:02:58.093 --> 03:03:01.615]  We were swimming in the hot tub in the pool and they were shooting each other with water guns with cold water in them.
[03:03:01.635 --> 03:03:01.755]  Yeah.
[03:03:02.235 --> 03:03:02.796]  And there was yelling.
[03:03:02.816 --> 03:03:03.916]  Was there fluoride in that water?
[03:03:03.936 --> 03:03:04.557]  I think there was.
[03:03:04.877 --> 03:03:06.578]  And there was yelling and screaming going on.
[03:03:06.598 --> 03:03:08.659]  The neighbors called the police on us.
[03:03:09.179 --> 03:03:11.700]  And they had my parents' gate cut and came in real nice and then left.
[03:03:11.740 --> 03:03:14.261]  But that wasn't in our city, was it?
[03:03:14.281 --> 03:03:15.002]  No, that was in Austin.
[03:03:15.022 --> 03:03:15.842]  That was my parents in Austin.
[03:03:15.882 --> 03:03:16.383]  Oh, your parents.
[03:03:16.523 --> 03:03:20.825]  But what I'm saying is that what scares me is the tattletales that call the police for no reason.
[03:03:21.405 --> 03:03:25.890]  Well, you know, but the problem is that people, you know, everybody blames the police for everything.
[03:03:26.030 --> 03:03:26.951]  We're not there.
[03:03:27.011 --> 03:03:31.196]  And when we get 911 calls, we're required to check it out.
[03:03:31.256 --> 03:03:34.739]  And that's why it's important to train rigorously.
[03:03:35.140 --> 03:03:38.804]  It's really important for us to have good policies, good procedures, good training.
[03:03:39.244 --> 03:03:42.627]  What do you make of the moves in the military to start replacing humans with robots?
[03:04:03.493 --> 03:04:17.122]  You know, I'm kind of a guy that, quite frankly, I don't know what they're going to do, but I worry about technology.
[03:04:17.822 --> 03:04:19.603]  Will we be able to control the technology?
[03:04:19.764 --> 03:04:32.712]  If you think about, for a minute, when the Internet was invented, nobody ever thought for a minute about the bad outcomes, the unintended consequences, all the crimes that are being committed on the Internet.
[03:04:33.976 --> 03:04:44.320]  From, you know, the distribution of child pornography, to fraud, to stealing people's money, just all the things that the internet has... The unintended consequences.
[03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:56.005]  The unintended consequences are, we're trying to build intelligence, an intelligent creature, an intelligent machine, and the question isn't how far we can go, the question is will we be able to control it.
[03:04:57.085 --> 03:04:57.926]  If we go too far.
[03:04:58.227 --> 03:05:02.592]  And that's what I worry about as a member of the human species.

[03:07:18.793 --> 03:07:23.359]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico.
[03:07:23.479 --> 03:07:27.023]  Where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:07:27.183 --> 03:07:31.888]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:07:32.068 --> 03:07:38.475]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com

[03:07:46.021 --> 03:07:52.907]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:07:53.047 --> 03:07:57.411]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:08:22.739 --> 03:08:25.325]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:08:25.445 --> 03:08:28.191]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:08:28.432 --> 03:08:30.757]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:08:37.646 --> 03:08:41.870]  Alright, we've got a final segment with Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo, who got here a little bit late.
[03:08:42.310 --> 03:08:43.191]  He's busy with his duties.
[03:08:43.511 --> 03:08:46.253]  But if he's got more time, I'd love to do a 10-minute interview for the Nightly News.
[03:08:46.273 --> 03:08:47.554]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[03:08:47.574 --> 03:08:51.597]  Okay, well get everybody suited up then in 12 minutes over there to interview him for the Nightly News.
[03:08:52.338 --> 03:08:53.999]  Get Jakari Jackson or somebody to interview him.
[03:08:54.860 --> 03:08:56.861]  But seriously, I've been asking a lot of the questions.
[03:08:58.062 --> 03:09:02.586]  How about you say some of the things you think are most important today for the audience out there nationwide listening?
[03:09:02.846 --> 03:09:15.436]  Well, you know, one of the things that frustrates me as a leader in law enforcement, a democracy's health starts with good government systems in terms of cops doing the right thing for the right reasons and a lot of folks will tell me...
[03:09:16.176 --> 03:09:18.557]  Six, no, seven months ago this happened.
[03:09:18.738 --> 03:09:21.179]  Well, it doesn't do us any good if you don't have the details.
[03:09:21.239 --> 03:09:28.663]  If we fall short, we'd like to know about it, we'd like to know the facts, and the sooner the better so we can correct behavior.
[03:09:28.683 --> 03:09:30.284]  You cannot correct behavior.
[03:09:31.064 --> 03:09:32.866]  That you're not made aware of, one.
[03:09:32.966 --> 03:09:35.768]  And two, when crimes occur, please report it.
[03:09:35.829 --> 03:09:39.372]  There's some folks who don't even, they don't want to trust the police, don't even bother reporting crimes.
[03:09:39.432 --> 03:09:44.617]  And, you know, we can't go out through the bad guys if we don't know the crime occurred in the first place.
[03:09:44.657 --> 03:09:46.919]  So, you know, I believe in engagement.
[03:09:47.319 --> 03:09:52.923]  That's why, from day one, I've been coming here to engage you and the community you serve.
[03:09:53.563 --> 03:09:59.047]  And quite frankly, as you know, we sometimes have more in common in terms of what our thoughts are than we don't.
[03:09:59.587 --> 03:10:02.389]  But we want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.
[03:10:02.409 --> 03:10:07.993]  The only way we can do that is through mutual respect and through engagement and through brutal honesty.
[03:10:08.809 --> 03:10:10.850]  What about the federalization of police?
[03:10:10.910 --> 03:10:12.251]  Because we all know that's going on.
[03:10:12.271 --> 03:10:15.474]  The federal funding, the threat fusion centers, the NSA.
[03:10:15.794 --> 03:10:17.515]  What's your view on the federal government?
[03:10:17.935 --> 03:10:19.896]  Is it out of control with the NSA?
[03:10:20.888 --> 03:10:24.670]  Well, you know, I don't know if they're out of control.
[03:10:24.750 --> 03:10:29.933]  I think that because of what happened with the young man that's now in Russia.
[03:10:30.854 --> 03:10:31.254]  Snowden?
[03:10:31.454 --> 03:10:35.116]  Yes, Mr. Snowden, that some changes have been made.
[03:10:35.877 --> 03:10:43.921]  But I can tell you this, that the partners that we work with, they are very respectful of the Constitution.
[03:10:44.922 --> 03:10:48.844]  They know that in the Austin Police Department, we are committed to constitutional policing.
[03:10:49.444 --> 03:10:55.526]  And we are committed to respect the rights of the citizens that we serve, because our power really does come from the people that we serve.
[03:10:55.566 --> 03:10:59.828]  But you guys do data mine what's open source, which is legal and lawful.
[03:11:00.028 --> 03:11:03.189]  Can you repeat to me what you said earlier out there, how you're concerned for me?
[03:11:03.229 --> 03:11:08.611]  You know, if you get any threat, we may pick up on that.
[03:11:10.032 --> 03:11:11.633]  You were saying you guys see the threats I get?
[03:11:11.653 --> 03:11:19.980]  There's some associations out there, and so you kind of worry about, you know, threats against members of your community and against institutions in your community.
[03:11:20.761 --> 03:11:27.727]  And so what people don't understand is speech... But really, because I'm aware of the threats, but you guys, you're actually aware of all the death threats I get?
[03:11:27.947 --> 03:11:29.308]  I mean, the public ones?
[03:11:29.468 --> 03:11:33.252]  We do become aware of some of them, and we make sure that there's nothing to it.
[03:11:33.292 --> 03:11:35.113]  Because, you know, the bottom line is this.
[03:11:35.153 --> 03:11:36.715]  We all have a First Amendment right.
[03:11:37.355 --> 03:11:43.040]  But we don't have the right to make terrorist threats, terroristic threats to people to say you're going to kill them, that you're going to blow them up.
[03:11:43.160 --> 03:11:56.713]  One time I got a call from the feds actually saying about six years ago that somebody was coming to shoot me at an event and sure enough the guy showed up and sure enough they drug him out and he had a bunch of guns in his car and was playing it but they never got in trouble though.
[03:11:58.815 --> 03:12:17.322]  Let me just say this, that we, we, we, we are not interested in your political ideology, we're not interested in your beliefs, but when you start making threats to harm somebody, to kill somebody, to commit a, what's clearly a crime, we will always take that seriously and we will always... Well, that's illegal, isn't it?
[03:12:17.362 --> 03:12:18.603]  A call to action for violence?
[03:12:18.983 --> 03:12:22.924]  Well, if you're threatening to commit a crime, absolutely.
[03:12:22.944 --> 03:12:24.165]  It can be a problem.
[03:12:25.151 --> 03:12:28.915]  Yeah, because if you say, I'm so mad at Bob, I could kill him, but then you're not serious.
[03:12:29.075 --> 03:12:29.336]  Right.
[03:12:29.856 --> 03:12:43.932]  But if you start making plans to kill Bob... Oh, if you're going to say, you know what, I hate Bob, he's a piece of work, and I'm going to go kill him, that's not protected speech, because it doesn't mean that you can't say it, but it may result in an investigation.
[03:12:44.628 --> 03:12:52.934]  I have the article here out of The Current, police officer charged with sexually assaulting police explorer, I guess somebody went on a ride-along, a 17-year-old cadet.
[03:12:53.394 --> 03:12:55.976]  Is that the kind of cases you're talking about that you're glad Austin doesn't have?
[03:12:56.016 --> 03:13:10.946]  You know, again, you know, the analogy, probably shouldn't have used it, but the frustration for me is that sometimes what passes for controversy in Austin, all we simply did was a woman ran past the cop who's standing there going, hey, stop, police!
[03:13:11.406 --> 03:13:14.188]  Ran at him and passed him and yelled, stop.
[03:13:14.648 --> 03:13:21.114]  The other officer sees it, runs after her, is yelling police, is right by her, looking at her, stop police, finally grabs her arm.
[03:13:21.814 --> 03:13:26.118]  When she takes off her earbuds, I don't give an F who you are, get your hands off of me.
[03:13:26.578 --> 03:13:27.960]  And then she looks like she's going to run again.
[03:13:27.980 --> 03:13:30.782]  Make a long story short, refused to say her name.
[03:13:30.882 --> 03:13:34.305]  All they want to do is write a ticket or a warning and move on with their day and just lost it.
[03:13:34.705 --> 03:13:37.407]  We cannot, you don't get the opt-out of a ticket.
[03:13:37.968 --> 03:13:45.034]  I know, but I think the police are getting the blowback of the overall anger at the system and the political corruption at the top.
[03:13:45.074 --> 03:13:54.501]  You know, what's really interesting is that when you look at the tweets and everything else and then you follow, you know, I've gotten some threats myself because of this incident where people don't even have the facts.
[03:13:55.142 --> 03:13:58.605]  All they have is a video of a young lady sitting down on a sidewalk screaming.
[03:13:59.125 --> 03:14:00.406]  And somehow it's all the police's fault.
[03:14:00.426 --> 03:14:02.648]  They have no idea how we got to that point.
[03:14:03.809 --> 03:14:09.653]  And so the threats that we've been getting and the anger that you see, and you see who these people are, they're angry at the government, they're angry at everything else.
[03:14:09.673 --> 03:14:15.738]  But what I tell my officers is that we are operating at a time when mistrust of government is a historical high.
[03:14:16.018 --> 03:14:27.187]  So you have to be aware of that and you have to be really good, really fair, and make sure that you're policing in a constitutionally lawful manner because it's a very angry backdrop right now.
[03:14:27.347 --> 03:14:32.790]  Well, that's why we are now deprogramming you and your love affair with Mayor Bloomberg and Mayors Against Gun Violence.
[03:14:33.270 --> 03:14:38.952]  I am giving you an extra-large Molon Labe Infowars Spartan shirt.
[03:14:39.332 --> 03:14:41.133]  And tell me, police chief, this is made in America.
[03:14:41.353 --> 03:14:42.254]  Feel that fabric.
[03:14:42.534 --> 03:14:43.935]  Available at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:14:43.955 --> 03:14:44.895]  That's how we fund our operation.
[03:14:45.155 --> 03:14:45.775]  Do you like it?
[03:14:45.795 --> 03:14:46.836]  Yeah, it's very nice.
[03:14:46.876 --> 03:14:47.316]  Very nice.
[03:14:47.336 --> 03:14:47.876]  Very soft.
[03:14:47.976 --> 03:14:49.137]  Okay, you promise you're going to wear that?
[03:14:50.137 --> 03:14:52.521]  Yeah, when you take them to 50 caliber shooting it, you keep promise.
[03:14:52.541 --> 03:14:53.203]  That's gonna happen!
[03:14:53.223 --> 03:14:54.264]  Does it include lunch though?
[03:14:54.325 --> 03:14:54.585]  Yes.
[03:14:54.825 --> 03:14:55.086]  Okay.
[03:14:55.106 --> 03:14:56.068]  What do you want for lunch?
[03:14:56.228 --> 03:14:58.692]  Well, some of the superfood and everything else you got here.
[03:15:00.151 --> 03:15:01.172]  Alright, we're going to do it.
[03:15:01.272 --> 03:15:02.173]  Okay, well let's talk about it.
[03:15:02.693 --> 03:15:14.443]  We're giving you fluoride shield, it's kind of like you've come to the prices right, survival shield, super male vitality, and made by Navy Seals, 1776 worldwide, .50 caliber bottle breacher.
[03:15:14.523 --> 03:15:15.744]  That's pretty cool.
[03:15:15.804 --> 03:15:18.326]  Give this to your deputy chief, there's another one inside there.
[03:15:18.606 --> 03:15:19.907]  All sorts of liberty trinkets.
[03:15:20.848 --> 03:15:25.352]  Listen, Alex, we appreciate you always bringing us in here.
[03:15:25.953 --> 03:15:42.829]  You don't have to agree to disagree, and I think one of the things that we need to work on as a society is that sometimes people may have the right, they may be right on an issue, but because they're screaming about the issue, the way that they're expressing themselves ends up, people just hear noise instead of
[03:15:43.590 --> 03:15:54.833]  Well sure, I mean, I never came at this with some plan, and I did used to yell and scream a lot more than I do now, and I have noticed it's actually more effective to be calm with information a lot of the time.
[03:15:54.853 --> 03:15:58.433]  I still remember your appearance with, what's his name on CNN?
[03:15:58.493 --> 03:15:59.654]  Here's Morgan's bye-bye now.
[03:16:00.174 --> 03:16:00.814]  Is he gone, really?
[03:16:00.834 --> 03:16:02.374]  Yeah, he lost his show two days ago.
[03:16:02.394 --> 03:16:05.015]  Oh, I didn't know that, but I remember watching him.
[03:16:05.215 --> 03:16:07.135]  Now that was effective because I called him out.
[03:16:07.235 --> 03:16:08.296]  Well, I couldn't stop laughing.
[03:16:10.977 --> 03:16:11.857]  I just leave it at that.
[03:16:13.118 --> 03:16:17.741]  It was fun to watch because I don't think he knew what he got himself into.
[03:16:17.982 --> 03:16:21.704]  Art, do you want to twin fire 50 Cal Barrett's handheld?
[03:16:22.505 --> 03:16:23.305]  Yeah, we'll do whatever.
[03:16:23.425 --> 03:16:25.907]  That would look pretty manly for everybody on the force.
[03:16:26.407 --> 03:16:27.528]  Everybody would think that's pretty macho.
[03:16:27.788 --> 03:16:28.949]  Yeah, but you said that a year ago.
[03:16:28.969 --> 03:16:29.530]  I'm still waiting.
[03:16:29.650 --> 03:16:30.210]  Okay, that's it.
[03:16:30.250 --> 03:16:30.811]  You want to go on?
[03:16:31.071 --> 03:16:32.792]  I'm going to England to speak at Oxford in a couple weeks.
[03:16:32.912 --> 03:16:33.253]  Okay.
[03:16:33.313 --> 03:16:34.674]  When I get back, I'm going to call you.
[03:16:34.714 --> 03:16:36.475]  You know how long I'm on the no-fly list?
[03:16:36.916 --> 03:16:37.817]  I don't think I was ever on it.
[03:16:37.877 --> 03:16:38.197]  Yeah, I know.
[03:16:38.217 --> 03:16:38.577]  I'm kidding.
[03:16:38.617 --> 03:16:41.560]  But my dad, because his name is so common, was on it for a while.
[03:16:41.940 --> 03:16:42.220]  Really?
[03:16:42.340 --> 03:16:43.081]  No criminal record.
[03:16:43.481 --> 03:16:47.365]  David Jones is a very common name.
[03:16:47.525 --> 03:16:48.926]  Yeah, I actually know an Alex Jones.
[03:16:48.986 --> 03:16:49.446]  It's not you.
[03:16:49.466 --> 03:16:51.048]  There's a lot of Alex Jones's now.
[03:16:51.744 --> 03:16:52.385]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:17:05.936 --> 03:17:07.576]  Everybody knows your dad really was, though.
[03:17:07.996 --> 03:17:13.858]  Hey, my dad, that's why when you call me communist, and people that know nothing about me call me a communist, I'm sorry.
[03:17:13.878 --> 03:17:18.599]  Well, I was saying, if you don't want the guns around, then that would be like supporting Fidel.
[03:17:18.659 --> 03:17:19.919]  No, absolutely not.
[03:17:19.999 --> 03:17:21.859]  You should go to Cuba.
[03:17:21.879 --> 03:17:22.479]  You know what?
[03:17:22.699 --> 03:17:29.781]  Why would I not want to have a process in place to try to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, felons, drug dealers?
[03:17:29.881 --> 03:17:30.221]  Why?
[03:17:30.341 --> 03:17:30.941]  Gangbangers?
[03:17:30.961 --> 03:17:31.021]  Why?
[03:17:31.141 --> 03:17:33.722]  Because they're only going to use that process against law-abiding people.
[03:17:33.742 --> 03:17:34.162]  You know what?
[03:17:35.262 --> 03:17:38.324]  They are now confiscating all the guns in Connecticut.
[03:17:38.344 --> 03:17:39.604]  Well, I don't pay attention to Connecticut.
[03:17:39.684 --> 03:17:40.765]  I'm talking about Texas.
[03:17:40.825 --> 03:17:45.388]  Texans are very responsible gun owners, are concealed handgun licensees.
[03:17:45.428 --> 03:17:47.989]  My uncle's 80-something years old.
[03:17:48.029 --> 03:17:49.830]  He still goes and qualifies all the time.
[03:17:50.530 --> 03:17:51.971]  I think we do it right in Texas.
[03:17:52.511 --> 03:17:58.575]  But you protect the Second Amendment by doing what we can to ensure that prohibited gun
[03:17:59.315 --> 03:18:08.180]  Owners and gun buyers are... We keep the guns... See, I believe that you genuinely see the good side of that.
[03:18:08.260 --> 03:18:12.342]  Bottom line, Bloomberg and others want the abolition of civilian ownership of firearms.
[03:18:12.682 --> 03:18:13.843]  That's what the UN wants.
[03:18:14.949 --> 03:18:18.512]  Mike Martinez did say, hey, we're going to register them now and you'll need that sign later.
[03:18:18.532 --> 03:18:19.553]  We're going to confiscate them later.
[03:18:19.793 --> 03:18:21.775]  There is an anti-gun attitude out there.
[03:18:21.815 --> 03:18:27.820]  Well, I mean, there may be, but I can tell you that the majority of American law enforcement, we are not in.
[03:18:27.860 --> 03:18:28.461]  No, I know that.
[03:18:28.561 --> 03:18:28.901]  I know that.
[03:18:28.961 --> 03:18:33.025]  Out of the hands of American citizens.
[03:18:33.085 --> 03:18:39.570]  But I am interested in ensuring that one of the things that you might want to support, like they did in the state of California, is
[03:18:41.972 --> 03:18:46.114]  Mandatory sentencing when you commit a crime and you use a gun.
[03:18:46.954 --> 03:18:50.955]  Or if you use a gun in a commission of a felony, you must do 10 years in prison.
[03:18:51.455 --> 03:18:54.296]  If you shoot somebody, you have a minimum of 20 years in prison.
[03:18:55.017 --> 03:19:01.419]  That really, when those mandatory sentences passed in California in terms of the use of firearms in crimes,
[03:19:02.199 --> 03:19:08.867]  It really had an impact on violent crime, so... But I mean, violent crime with guns has dropped 51%, the Justice Department's own numbers, since 1992.
[03:19:08.947 --> 03:19:11.690]  But people need to quit blaming guns overall.
[03:19:11.750 --> 03:19:12.951]  More guns means less crime.
[03:19:13.031 --> 03:19:13.572]  I'm not worried about that.
[03:19:13.592 --> 03:19:14.653]  Does more guns mean less crime?
[03:19:14.693 --> 03:19:15.795]  No, I'm more... I'm not worried about that.
[03:19:15.875 --> 03:19:16.555]  And you say Moulin Lambe.
[03:19:17.296 --> 03:19:19.580]  I'm not worried about guns, I'm worried about guns in the wrong hands.
[03:19:20.140 --> 03:19:26.850]  And the more we continue to reduce that gun violence, the better position we'll be to protect the citizens.
[03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:27.350]  What about Molong?
[03:19:27.370 --> 03:19:28.552]  Can you say Molong Lobby?
[03:19:29.153 --> 03:19:31.396]  No, I don't even know what that means.
[03:19:31.416 --> 03:19:32.497]  It means come and take it.
[03:19:33.123 --> 03:19:33.844]  Molon Lobby?
[03:19:33.864 --> 03:19:36.045]  I've got that right by, have you seen my office?
[03:19:36.065 --> 03:19:38.407]  I've got that framed right by my desk.
[03:19:38.427 --> 03:19:39.107]  Come and take it.
[03:19:39.187 --> 03:19:39.748]  Come and take it.
[03:19:40.428 --> 03:19:41.949]  Oh my gosh, well that's what they say.
[03:19:41.989 --> 03:19:42.530]  You have that?
[03:19:42.990 --> 03:19:43.230]  Yes.
[03:19:43.450 --> 03:19:44.511]  I promise.
[03:19:44.851 --> 03:19:46.533]  I will tweet a picture of that today.
[03:19:47.193 --> 03:19:47.733]  In your honor.
[03:19:47.753 --> 03:19:50.475]  Alright, well I want you to tweet this next to it.
[03:19:50.535 --> 03:19:52.056]  Because that's in the Greek.
[03:19:52.076 --> 03:19:53.477]  If you don't believe me, look it up.
[03:19:53.497 --> 03:19:54.398]  I will have to look it up.
[03:19:54.418 --> 03:19:57.740]  It doesn't say something like, you know, I'm evil or something.
[03:19:57.981 --> 03:19:58.801]  And we're not tricking you.
[03:19:58.901 --> 03:19:59.522]  I'll double check.
[03:19:59.742 --> 03:20:01.463]  Molon Lobby means come and take it.
[03:20:01.563 --> 03:20:02.124]  How much are these?
[03:20:03.284 --> 03:20:03.725]  It's like $22.
[03:20:03.805 --> 03:20:05.586]  It's made in America, and it helps fund our operation.
[03:20:05.887 --> 03:20:06.787]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:20:07.068 --> 03:20:08.629]  Hey, promise you're gonna go shooting with us.
[03:20:08.669 --> 03:20:09.129]  That's a done deal.
[03:20:09.550 --> 03:20:09.810]  Alright.
[03:20:10.030 --> 03:20:10.571]  Alright, it's done.
[03:20:10.611 --> 03:20:10.891]  It's done.
[03:20:10.911 --> 03:20:11.151]  It's done.
[03:20:11.291 --> 03:20:12.432]  The studies are legion.
[03:20:12.712 --> 03:20:20.099]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[03:20:20.239 --> 03:20:23.682]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[03:20:23.882 --> 03:20:24.462]  It's simple.
[03:20:24.602 --> 03:20:29.063]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[03:20:29.323 --> 03:20:34.804]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[03:20:35.044 --> 03:20:40.426]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars line fluoride shield formulation.
[03:20:40.586 --> 03:20:51.048]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[03:20:51.368 --> 03:20:55.631]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[03:20:55.951 --> 03:20:57.792]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[03:20:58.112 --> 03:21:03.416]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[03:21:03.656 --> 03:21:07.919]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[03:21:08.079 --> 03:21:09.400]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:21:10.200 --> 03:21:16.428]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:21:16.868 --> 03:21:23.456]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live
