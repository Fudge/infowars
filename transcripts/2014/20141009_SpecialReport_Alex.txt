[00:00:14.838 --> 00:00:17.559]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.703]  Now, we just found out here that patient zero, Thomas Eric Duncan, has died of the Ebola virus at the hospital.
[00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:28.465]  Now, the other day he was given an experimental drug.
[00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:31.567]  Obviously, that hasn't worked out too well.
[00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:40.228]  You know, it looks like our government is obsessed with trying to push these experimental drugs on people, and it quite frankly isn't working.
[00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:46.832]  You know, two of the doctors who have gotten the Ebola virus were given experimental drugs, but they were also given
[00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:48.472]  Blood transfusions.
[00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:51.853]  Each doctor was given a separate experimental drug.
[00:00:51.873 --> 00:00:55.254]  I think the common factor right there would be the blood transfusion.
[00:00:55.714 --> 00:00:57.835]  Now, do you think the CDC is really going to admit that?
[00:00:57.855 --> 00:00:59.835]  Do you think our government is going to admit that?
[00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:00.756]  Negative.
[00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:02.716]  They want to make money off of these drugs.
[00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:04.557]  They want to scare you.
[00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:12.679]  They want you to feel like that if you get this, you have to come to them, pay top dollar for this drug, and then the chances of you even surviving from it are slim to none.
[00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.679]  You're dead anyways.
[00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.100]  As long as they get your money, they don't care.
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.865]  So, another thing that I find extremely crazy about the CDC, day in and day out they keep coming on TV and saying, hey, you've got nothing to worry about.
[00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:25.826]  We're professionals.
[00:01:26.346 --> 00:01:27.067]  We got your back.
[00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:29.428]  Well, this is how they have our back.
[00:01:29.748 --> 00:01:39.955]  The daughter, the stepdaughter of the patient Zero has been in contact helping him at his apartment in Dallas since day one of him showing the signs and symptoms.
[00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:44.178]  She's checked on him since the Thursday all the way until Sunday until he was taken to the hospital.
[00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:51.460]  So she sat there in the apartment with all that while he's vomiting, he's using the bathroom, all that stuff.
[00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.861]  Sweat, she touched the sheets, everything.
[00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:57.083]  So what has the CDC been saying since day one?
[00:01:57.303 --> 00:01:59.263]  There's a 21-day incubation period.
[00:02:00.384 --> 00:02:07.346]  So for 21 days, at any time in that period, you on the 21st day could all of a sudden start showing signs and symptoms.
[00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:11.768]  Coughing, having flu-like symptoms, very high fever, all that.
[00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:21.311]  So why is it now, the 14th day, and just a few days ago, she was cleared by the CDC to return to work?
[00:02:22.012 --> 00:02:23.094]  She's a health care worker.
[00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:24.616]  She works at a hospital.
[00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:34.611]  Thank God she is smart enough to know that she hasn't waited that entire 21 day period and she's saying she's not going to go back to work.
[00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:44.934]  But the CDC, the people who are in charge, the ones that tell us every day that they have our back, the ones who are professionals, that they know science, they're saying that she's good to go back.
[00:02:44.994 --> 00:02:48.935]  Meanwhile, everyone else is still quarantined and she's been around him more.
[00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:51.203]  I mean, what does that say?
[00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:58.350]  Another thing to think about, the kids, there was five kids who were in contact with patient zero that went to four different schools.
[00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.192]  They were at those schools for a while.
[00:03:00.432 --> 00:03:04.976]  The parents in that area had to pull those kids out of there because they were scared for their child's safety.
[00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:05.917]  Wouldn't you be?
[00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:10.301]  But what's funny is if you have Ebola or you've been in contact with someone who has Ebola,
[00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:12.483]  CDC's not really that worried about it.
[00:03:12.703 --> 00:03:17.167]  They're going to wait until you possibly start showing signs and symptoms, and then they'll take care of it.
[00:03:17.527 --> 00:03:21.710]  Meanwhile, if you refuse to get a flu shot, you'll be told you can't be at school.
[00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:22.771]  Ebola?
[00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:23.412]  Okay.
[00:03:23.772 --> 00:03:24.332]  Flu shot?
[00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:25.833]  Hmm, we don't want you around our kids.
[00:03:26.294 --> 00:03:27.074]  You might get something.
[00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:30.137]  People say that you shouldn't be scared.
[00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.458]  The CDC's saying that there's nothing to worry about.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.522]  I pretty much would have to say I disagree with that.
[00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.785]  I think you should be scared, because these government bureaucrats who are supposed to have our back, who are supposed to beâ€”
[00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:53.704]  Having our best interests in mind, the ones who are supposed to be professional, the scientists who are experts on all of this, that say that they know what's going on, that there's nothing to be scared about.
[00:03:54.564 --> 00:04:01.766]  That's what's scary, is the fact that their ego's so big that they can't admit the fact that there is an issue, and that they aren't well prepared for it.
[00:04:02.247 --> 00:04:09.729]  We know that, that they're not well prepared for it, because they haven't trickled down the information that hasn't trickled down the ladder to the lowest people in the hospitals.
[00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.270]  But they want to tell you that you're going to be okay.
[00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:16.574]  And it's just, it's something that you have to take into your own consideration.
[00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:17.915]  You've got to wash your hands.
[00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:25.221]  You've got to make sure that you're being mindful of the people you talk to, what you're doing, the things that you're touching, not touching your mouth.
[00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:28.583]  Keep some hand sanitizer in your pocket and just be safe.
[00:04:29.384 --> 00:04:33.327]  Watch our reports and continue to get information on this as it happens.
