[00:00:06.288 --> 00:00:08.870]  There's a lot of speculation going around about the Bo Bergdahl story.
[00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:14.755]  What the government says is that there was a combat patrol, Bo fell behind and the Taliban captured him.
[00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:25.664]  What the guys in his unit are saying is that he planned to leave, he left a note behind saying that he was fed up with the army and what was going on in Afghanistan and he was going on to start a new life.
[00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:30.528]  Now whether or not you believe Bo Bergdahl is a hero or a deserter,
[00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:32.413]  Doesn't matter.
[00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:36.035]  What we do know is that men lost their lives looking for him.
[00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:42.179]  How would you feel waking up, doing roll call, and finding out that one of your brothers is missing?
[00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:43.940]  You would do anything you could.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.362]  You would search day and night looking for him, just like those men did.
[00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:48.642]  And men died.
[00:00:49.723 --> 00:00:56.947]  And now five years later, they find out that not only did he desert them, but their brothers died for nothing.
[00:00:58.288 --> 00:00:59.149]  Just think about that.
[00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.212]  Yesterday I was scrolling through Facebook and I was invited to a page.
[00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:06.775]  And apparently it was started by a lot of the members from his old unit.
[00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:09.738]  And it was called, Bo Bergdahl is not a hero.
[00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:11.740]  And it was very interesting.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.383]  I was scrolling through and I saw an image that a wife had put up.
[00:01:16.404 --> 00:01:20.427]  And it was of her husband beside a wheelchair with his daughter.
[00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:22.850]  And he is permanently injured.
[00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.192]  He got hurt looking for Bo.
[00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:31.678]  There's a lot of people that are very upset about him leaving, so I just want people to understand their side of the story as well.
[00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.800]  I know it's easy to get caught up in emotion and think, you know, he's back, we should just leave him alone.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.860]  That's understandable.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.161]  But just stop for a minute, put emotion aside, and look at the facts.
[00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:44.662]  Soldiers from Bo's old unit were told not to speak about the events.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.221]  Now that's just very odd.
[00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:52.022]  You know, to be told by the government you can't talk about this.
[00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:54.542]  And why is that?
[00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:57.843]  Now soldiers from Bozoldian are starting to speak out.
[00:01:58.523 --> 00:02:00.044]  A lot of them said they're glad that he's back.
[00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:01.124]  Now it's understandable.
[00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:03.065]  He's been away from his family for five years.
[00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:04.765]  He deserves to be back home.
[00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:08.066]  But once he's better, what they want is justice.
[00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:12.617]  And it's not hard to believe that that's how those guys would feel.
[00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:14.318]  You know, people died.
[00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.283]  Of course, he should stand trial, he should be held accountable for his actions.
[00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:20.765]  That's not wrong to think.
[00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:28.753]  So, stop being emotional, stop being hateful to people who do want justice for the lives that were lost.
[00:02:38.902 --> 00:02:42.624]  Alert the public to Obama's blatant abuse of power.
