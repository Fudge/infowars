[00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:11.127]  Did Chris Brown just endorse Endgame?
[00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:18.673]  Earlier today, the R&B singer tweeted out his thoughts on the current Ebola pandemic, calling it a form of population control.
[00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:24.257]  Now, much like anything that the singer says, his thoughts were instantly met with criticism.
[00:00:24.677 --> 00:00:26.639]  But are his thoughts that far off?
[00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:34.841]  Earlier this month, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan also spoke out about Ebola, calling it a form of population control.
[00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:40.383]  He specifically said Ebola, like AIDS, was designed to kill black people.
[00:00:40.703 --> 00:00:48.125]  We've reported extensively on the elite's obsession with eugenics, which is of course the idea that the world should be culled
[00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:49.946]  Of its less desirables.
[00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:58.572]  Now there is its current day incarnation, population control, which the elites have been obsessed with for more than a hundred years.
[00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:02.154]  Take into account the National Security Study Memorandum 200.
[00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:08.939]  It was completed in December 1974 under the direction of Henry Kissinger.
[00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.482]  It outlined the implications of worldwide population growth for U.S.
[00:01:14.502 --> 00:01:16.704]  security and overseas interests.
[00:01:17.304 --> 00:01:22.708]  The policy gives paramount importance to population control measures in countries that the U.S.
[00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.270]  would seek to exploit their resources.
[00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:38.580]  And in 2006, Dr. Eric Pianka, a biologist based at the University of Texas in Austin, advocated the need to exterminate 90% of the world's population through the airborne Ebola virus.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.086]  And we cover all of this eugenics and these race-specific population control measures extensively in our documentary, Endgame.
[00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:59.636]  In the draft copy of the United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment, it states very clearly that we must reduce the human population from what's current level of about 6 billion people down to about 1 billion people.
[00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:10.824]  In the 1970s, South Africa developed race-specific bioweapons to target blacks and Asians, and then subsequently sold the technology to Israel in the mid-1980s.
[00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:23.394]  In September of 2000, the Project for a New American Century published a document in which Dick Cheney described race-specific bioweapons as politically useful tools.
[00:02:25.475 --> 00:02:31.479]  And somebody mentioned, well, why would they want to reduce the human population when that means less money for them?
[00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:33.700]  Most people have no idea.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.500]  They're not after money.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.661]  They have all the money they need.
[00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:36.642]  They're after power.
[00:02:37.562 --> 00:02:38.443]  That's their aphrodisiac.
