[00:00:01.482 --> 00:00:03.404]  Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:05.986]  I'm here at the Civil Rights Summit here in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:06.046 --> 00:00:09.108]  As you can see, I have my worthless press pass.
[00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:15.193]  You know, here at the InfoWars, we rarely get credentialed, but we said, hey, Obama's going to be here, so let's get credentialed and try to get in.
[00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:20.517]  Out of the people in my organization, I was the only person who was approved, and when I found out I came here this morning,
[00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:30.689]  Ready to get in line to see Obama got here two hours early to get in line for it And they told me that I can't go in because I don't have the right press pass I was like what's what's the difference of press pass?
[00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:37.136]  I was talking to the to the staff here And they said well the Secret Service approved the people who are actually going to go into the auditorium
[00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:40.917]  So Secret Service approved media you can see behind me getting their pat-downs and so forth.
[00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:47.259]  I was not approved so I will not be able to go into the LBJ Museum.
[00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:55.321]  A man who did not help the USS Liberty actually took help away from the USS Liberty and also the Gulf of Tonkin incidents as well as many other things.
[00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:59.923]  Kit Daniels our writer at InfoWars.com is here as well and we'll get his take on the situation.
[00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:12.034]  Last night I came up here and I talked to a photojournalist who has been in the business for several years and he told me that the access, the press access here was the worst he's ever seen it.
[00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:18.321]  He could only get at most 200 yards away from Bill Clinton to take photography.
[00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:19.542]  You stand over here on this side.
[00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:21.643]  They just don't want you to have any kind of line of sight.
[00:01:22.623 --> 00:01:23.304]  They don't want what?
[00:01:23.544 --> 00:01:23.964]  Line of sight.
[00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:24.945]  You can't see them.
[00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:25.525]  Oh.
[00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:31.689]  Meaning that the photos he took were not very reasonable at all at that distance.
[00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:45.397]  So this also brings to mind what the White House AP staff said earlier this year when they admitted that they were losing access to the President as a media organization.
[00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.793]  As you can see, some of the media appears to be too timid to even come near the barricades.
[00:01:52.294 --> 00:01:53.815]  What's going on?
[00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:57.337]  Well, I was informed by one of your officers that I can't be filming on this side of the street.
[00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:00.639]  We're not anywhere near a secure area that I'm aware of.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.161]  We're just asking you to go to that side of the street.
[00:02:04.302 --> 00:02:04.502]  Right.
[00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:11.367]  So I'm not trying to be difficult, sir, but we can obviously get better footage on this side of the street if we're filming in this location.
[00:02:13.203 --> 00:02:16.546]  Just please abide by what we're telling you to do.
[00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:17.026]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:22.351]  Alright, but sir, I can't be in this area with my press pass, correct?
[00:02:23.272 --> 00:02:23.732]  No, you can't.
[00:02:23.912 --> 00:02:24.132]  Yes.
[00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:25.534]  Because you're properly credentialed.
[00:02:25.694 --> 00:02:25.954]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:26.454]  Yes.
[00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:29.257]  Okay, so I have no problem with this side of the street.
[00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.010]  Just not continuously.
[00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.311]  Not continuous?
[00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:32.751]  Right.
[00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:33.012]  Okay.
[00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:34.733]  Alright, not continuous.
[00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:36.815]  Alright, not continuous first amendment.
[00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:37.556]  Thank you, sir.
[00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:38.516]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:38.577 --> 00:02:39.537]  Excuse me, sir?
[00:02:39.577 --> 00:02:42.080]  Secret service called and makes the calls.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.300]  Okay.
[00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:59.948]  We are not afraid!
[00:03:03.356 --> 00:03:10.660]  Alright, since getting here earlier this morning, we have been able, at least I have been able with my press pass, been able to get a little closer to the scene.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.382]  I was up here closer to the LBJ, but still not able to get in.
[00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:20.265]  Kit was not anointed by the Secret Service so he could get nowhere near it, but we got a little bit closer.
[00:03:20.685 --> 00:03:22.986]  Since then we've had a very strong police presence.
[00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:26.888]  It's probably every bike cop in the city of Austin that's shown up.
[00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:28.148]  We have those shots of them coming in.
[00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.970]  Also, we've got guys walking around with shotguns out here, snipers on the roofs.
[00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:33.111]  It's a whole big deal.
[00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:41.153]  As you can see from the footage, the security theater here was meant, one of the primary objectives of it was to protect President Obama's image.
[00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:52.877]  You saw that activists were able to sit in the street for well over 10 minutes, but the police, under orders by Secret Service, would push press out of the street so they couldn't even take photographs.
[00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:56.558]  This is Kit Daniels and Jakari Jackson reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:12.330]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.650]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.471]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:21.612]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:04:21.952 --> 00:04:25.092]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:04:25.112 --> 00:04:32.374]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:43.619]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.180]  We are the resistance.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.820]  You are the resistance.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.741]  You are the info war.
[00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:53.063]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:04:53.243 --> 00:04:54.884]  We are the true media.
[00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.625]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:01.369]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
