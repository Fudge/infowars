[00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:09.390]  Death and taxes.
[00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.031]  Don't talk about politics or religion.
[00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:14.753]  This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
[00:00:14.753 --> 00:00:15.814]  Lay down, G.I.
[00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:17.055]  Lay down, G.I.
[00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.076]  We saw it all through the 20th century.
[00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:22.058]  And now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize.
[00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:25.621]  That we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:28.444]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:32.088]  I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:33.810]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.072]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:40.517]  Those that control my life, and those that seek to control it even more!
[00:00:40.517 --> 00:00:41.538]  I want freedom!
[00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:43.841]  That's what I want, and that's what you should want!
[00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:52.768]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn loose just some of the greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities, because that is the central mode of control.
[00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:59.993]  Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:04.517]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:07.239]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:08.760]  The 21st century is going to be another
[00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:18.917]  Not the century of slavery, not the century of lies and individual significance and classism, statism, and all the rest of the modes of control.
[00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:23.881]  It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.
[00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:26.903]  What a bunch of garbage, liberal, democrat, conservative, republican.
[00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:31.106]  It's all there to control you, two sides of the same coin.
[00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:36.811]  Two management teams, bidding for control, the CEO job of slavery incorporated.
[00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:39.433]  The truth is out there in front of you when they lay out this
[00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:41.475]  I'm sick of it!
[00:01:41.475 --> 00:01:45.598]  And I'm not going to take a bite out of it!
[00:01:45.598 --> 00:01:47.760]  Do you got me?
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.281]  Human kind is too good!
[00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:51.283]  We're not a bunch of underachievers!
[00:01:51.283 --> 00:01:54.165]  We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings!
[00:01:54.165 --> 00:01:56.327]  We're going to do real things!
[00:01:56.327 --> 00:01:57.748]  The things that matter!
[00:01:57.748 --> 00:01:58.769]  Creativity!
[00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:02.693]  And the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[00:02:02.693 --> 00:02:03.273]  Well that's it!
[00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:04.414]  That's all I've got to say!
[00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:05.195]  Continue your court!
[00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:44.289]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:50.137]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:53.720]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.922]  It's a military mission in North St.
[00:02:55.922 --> 00:02:56.583]  Louis.
[00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:59.145]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:03.809]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:08.593]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[00:03:08.593 --> 00:03:09.654]  Guns will be taken.
[00:03:09.654 --> 00:03:10.975]  No one will ever be armed.
[00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:11.976]  We will take all weapons.
[00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:14.537]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:19.119]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.960]  Enough.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.760]  Enough.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.821]  Enough.
[00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:22.201]  Enough.
[00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:26.763]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:31.125]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:37.248]  NSJS Late News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:46.320]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.945]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:51.527]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:58.648]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:03:58.648 --> 00:04:03.611]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:08.293]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:21.853]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[00:04:21.853 --> 00:04:22.674]  In your apartment!
[00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:23.756]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[00:04:23.756 --> 00:04:25.058]  Go back inside right now!
[00:04:25.058 --> 00:04:26.079]  I am inside.
[00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.982]  I have two words for you.
[00:04:27.982 --> 00:04:29.805]  Predator groans.
[00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:30.807]  You will never see it coming.
[00:04:34.847 --> 00:04:37.690]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:46.978]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[00:04:46.978 --> 00:04:52.143]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[00:04:52.423 --> 00:04:57.466]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:59.727]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:04:59.727 --> 00:05:00.467]  We're live, folks.
[00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:01.088]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:02.028]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.028 --> 00:05:04.230]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:12.294]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:05:12.294 --> 00:05:19.398]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:24.419]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:35.041]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:41.523]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:05:41.523 --> 00:05:43.763]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:05:43.763 --> 00:05:47.724]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[00:05:47.904 --> 00:05:49.864]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[00:05:49.864 --> 00:05:54.025]  All the products in Infowarslife.com are simply amazing.
[00:05:54.025 --> 00:06:02.347]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[00:06:02.347 --> 00:06:08.508]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:06:08.508 --> 00:06:13.069]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:17.630]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.972]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:06:20.972 --> 00:06:26.416]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:06:26.416 --> 00:06:33.801]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:37.944]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[00:06:37.944 --> 00:06:38.625]  Nobody else.
[00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:43.048]  He's got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:43.048 --> 00:06:51.676]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:06:51.676 --> 00:06:55.939]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:01.144]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:07:02.537 --> 00:07:04.839]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:12.263]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:07:12.263 --> 00:07:23.071]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:07:23.071 --> 00:07:32.337]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:07:33.057 --> 00:07:37.118]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:07:37.118 --> 00:07:40.879]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:42.939]  Experience the new formula.
[00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:45.519]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:46.840]  Shield your family.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.660]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.821]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:55.781]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:12.352]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:08:12.352 --> 00:08:14.675]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.722 --> 00:08:41.302]  Ain't no mountain high Ain't no valley low Ain't no river wide enough, baby If you need me, call me No matter where you are No matter how far Don't worry, baby Just call my name I'll be there in a hurry You don't have to worry Oh, baby, there ain't no mountain high
[00:08:49.508 --> 00:08:54.095]  Boy, it's hard to turn that off, isn't it?
[00:08:54.095 --> 00:08:57.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here.
[00:09:05.373 --> 00:09:07.114]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:08.714]  until 2 p.m.
[00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.775]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:12.856]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central.
[00:09:12.856 --> 00:09:16.137]  InfoWars Nightly News with our great crew.
[00:09:16.137 --> 00:09:20.699]  We appreciate all your support out there, listeners and viewers, and your prayers.
[00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:23.380]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and it is 8-7.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:23.820]  It is August 7, 2014.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.561]  We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:09:32.924 --> 00:09:36.227]  Again, every day, the news just gets more out of control.
[00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:41.111]  And I look back to 19 and a half years ago, first getting on air, and
[00:09:44.898 --> 00:10:06.243]  Thinking about the time to come when open world government and the planetary, authoritarian, totalitarian, autocratic technocracy would be established because Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carol Quigley, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the UN, UNESCO, the eugenics boards all had told us they were going to do this.
[00:10:07.228 --> 00:10:16.250]  And everything that they'd said 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100 years before, they had already completed.
[00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.831]  Not always exactly the way they wanted to do it, but they were guiding our world.
[00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:25.031]  They were in control to a great extent.
[00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:32.973]  And being a student of history, just because I found it to be so informative, enlightening, entertaining, riveting, captivating,
[00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:39.341]  I knew that I was basically living in a science fiction movie.
[00:10:39.341 --> 00:10:42.023]  And I've been saying that for 19 years on air.
[00:10:42.023 --> 00:10:43.703]  We were living in a science fiction movie then.
[00:10:43.703 --> 00:10:47.425]  And we're living in even more of one now.
[00:10:47.425 --> 00:10:58.871]  It is fantastical and even more wondrous and even more bizarre because it's real.
[00:10:58.871 --> 00:11:00.872]  That's why I can be walking down the street in Austin
[00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.331]  And even see an actor or somebody that I like.
[00:11:07.331 --> 00:11:32.775]  And I don't even say hi to them, because compared to the cosmos, compared to all the incredible wonders in the universe, or bats flying around in my backyard and nesting in the outside fireplace, or my children playing, or the wonders of just life on this planet, it just doesn't even matter.
[00:11:34.622 --> 00:11:59.178]  And then I see the general public totally captivated and narcissistic, artificially conditioned to be so from birth, reading People Magazine and Us Magazine and everyone trying to act cool and strut around with all the trappings of power.
[00:11:59.178 --> 00:12:01.179]  It makes me almost want to just do my show from a
[00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.913]  Cabin in the woods or something.
[00:12:06.913 --> 00:12:17.963]  Or to run to the hills and do a one hour briefing once a week from a mountaintop or something.
[00:12:17.963 --> 00:12:21.106]  Because it's just, I need to get out of it.
[00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:22.267]  I need to get away from it.
[00:12:22.267 --> 00:12:24.209]  I need to unplug from it.
[00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:28.153]  Just being around it is so crushing to my spirit.
[00:12:29.755 --> 00:12:38.760]  Not that my spirit's crushed, it's expanding and energized and opening up to the universe and all of God's mysteries and wonders.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:48.746]  It's so amazing to be alive, the gift of consciousness that I can recognize beauty and that you can recognize beauty and that we can share it together.
[00:12:48.746 --> 00:12:52.008]  It's just fantastic!
[00:12:52.008 --> 00:12:55.951]  But then, juxtaposed against all the good in the world,
[00:12:57.975 --> 00:13:02.357]  Is all the twisted lies and fraud.
[00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:05.559]  And the twisted lies and fraud myself.
[00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:14.484]  Just the fact that I have knowledge of good and evil and knowledge of how the globalists operate.
[00:13:14.484 --> 00:13:24.069]  I feel dirty even knowing it.
[00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:27.051]  It's like if you're walking along through a field and
[00:13:27.944 --> 00:13:44.898]  You come across a dead cow that's been dead for about a week, and maggots are literally pouring off of it, and other things like termites.
[00:13:44.898 --> 00:13:51.204]  People are usually mistaking a dead carcass on the side of the road and maggots for termites.
[00:13:51.204 --> 00:13:56.148]  You gotta try working on a ranch and being tasked to drag something like that off of the tractor.
[00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.493]  Which any farm boy's done.
[00:14:01.493 --> 00:14:05.756]  And you're not the dead horse or cow.
[00:14:05.756 --> 00:14:08.298]  But just dragging it away, you feel dirty and bad.
[00:14:08.298 --> 00:14:11.021]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:15.044]  Nietzsche said, do not look into the abyss lest you become the abyss.
[00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:29.246]  And even though I have become informed and enlightened to a high degree, in my view, compared to people that are totally unconscious, that's no trick at all.
[00:14:31.087 --> 00:14:49.893]  Take the blinders off, admit you're being manipulated, admit there's a larger universe around you, admit that we're being bred like cattle and conditioned, and you will immediately jump four or five levels consciously, intellectually, spiritually, where you were previous, buying into the world.
[00:14:49.893 --> 00:14:53.234]  When you say the world, it's the artificial construct
[00:14:54.094 --> 00:15:08.347]  of the political system and the priesthood of the Illuminati that seek to control and shutter consciousness and free will in the name of giving you free will.
[00:15:08.347 --> 00:15:13.492]  They don't want you to have the real free will, the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:15:13.492 --> 00:15:17.276]  It's a riddle because in the garden they had free will
[00:15:18.237 --> 00:15:20.839]  But they didn't have the knowledge of good and evil yet.
[00:15:20.839 --> 00:15:26.022]  They were given the free will to be deceived and take the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:15:26.022 --> 00:15:33.886]  And then it was like a virus of evil understanding and evil technology.
[00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:45.693]  Not the technology's evil itself, the evil technology of mind warfare, of twisted thinking, of disinformation.
[00:15:54.525 --> 00:16:02.547]  And it's a riddle within a riddle.
[00:16:02.547 --> 00:16:06.869]  That we have free will, but then what did we get in the garden?
[00:16:06.869 --> 00:16:11.190]  Even though I don't believe in that and see it as a parable or an allegory, it's very helpful.
[00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:16.392]  To where they had the free will to eat of the fruit, but once they ate of the fruit, they became dead inside.
[00:16:18.766 --> 00:16:26.893]  They obviously weren't completely dead inside, but now they had that aspect to dark knowledge, dark logic, twisted thinking.
[00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:34.984]  And then those paradigms in ancient civilization, as civilization formed, began to spin out from that point.
[00:16:34.984 --> 00:16:50.448]  And then the priest, the early priesthoods across all cultures, would get the knowledge of good and evil, but then return people back to a false garden, where they believe they're innocent and don't really even understand free will.
[00:16:54.147 --> 00:17:07.727]  And then the priests create a world only based on the dark, twisted logic and the dark, twisted algorithms so that the people never even become free and intelligent and awake and open.
[00:17:10.475 --> 00:17:27.007]  So understand, you go from the perfect innocence of the garden, but free will, into the knowledge of good and evil, and then through the knowledge of good and evil, evil is purified, is built up to then invert things and remove the knowledge of good.
[00:17:29.122 --> 00:17:48.745]  Until there is a crystallized form of wickedness that then operates to destroy all life on the planet and rewrite it in a silicon, anti-free will system.
[00:17:48.745 --> 00:17:52.546]  And I'm not trying to lay out sophisticated things here.
[00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:54.606]  If you understand it, it's not sophisticated.
[00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:58.207]  If you don't understand it, it's because you don't have the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:06.476]  You have it there, but it's never been activated in you.
[00:18:06.476 --> 00:18:14.185]  See, I'm not in the garden, but I'm back at the point of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:18:14.185 --> 00:18:19.971]  And many people are at the point of the knowledge of good and evil, so that we have the knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil.
[00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.393]  See, we always had the free will, but the virus hadn't been injected yet.
[00:18:27.393 --> 00:18:31.796]  The knowledge, the data cube, had not been downloaded yet.
[00:18:31.796 --> 00:18:35.058]  The virus had not been downloaded yet.
[00:18:35.058 --> 00:18:36.979]  Because before, you were just good.
[00:18:36.979 --> 00:18:41.702]  When you get the knowledge of good and evil, you learn you were good, and now there's evil.
[00:18:41.702 --> 00:18:47.086]  So now, you can begin to look into the abyss, and when you dance with the devil, he don't change, baby.
[00:18:47.086 --> 00:18:48.107]  You change.
[00:18:48.107 --> 00:18:49.508]  I change.
[00:18:49.508 --> 00:18:51.469]  And that's why I am of the devil.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:19:07.548]  This whole world has been already rewritten by the dark knowledge, by the dark matter, by the systems of twisted thinking.
[00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:08.508]  Does this make sense?
[00:19:08.508 --> 00:19:10.189]  Anybody in there?
[00:19:10.189 --> 00:19:11.410]  Total sense.
[00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:12.171]  Thank you.
[00:19:12.171 --> 00:19:12.731]  Yes.
[00:19:12.731 --> 00:19:13.651]  It's like a preacher here.
[00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:16.133]  I'm saying to the crowd out there, amen to that brother!
[00:19:17.469 --> 00:19:18.769]  No, I'm serious!
[00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:26.431]  And so I can sit here and cover all this incredible news, and the big guests we've got coming up today, and all of it.
[00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:36.573]  But in the final equation, the general public is out of their minds, mentally ill, is the word you could use.
[00:19:36.573 --> 00:19:40.094]  I mean, look at what they put up with.
[00:19:40.094 --> 00:19:41.194]  Look at what I put up with.
[00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:42.874]  Look at what you put up with.
[00:19:42.874 --> 00:19:47.135]  And it's when we break with the evil and say, we don't want to be part of this, this is bad.
[00:19:48.968 --> 00:19:51.873]  That we begin to turn the corner.
[00:19:51.873 --> 00:19:56.160]  It's the knowledge of good and evil that make you a choice that I want to be good.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.165]  We'll be back with unbelievable news.
[00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:00.187]  I will get to all of it.

[00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:05.717]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:21:05.717 --> 00:21:10.061]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:13.684]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:21:13.684 --> 00:21:16.706]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:21:16.706 --> 00:21:23.973]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:21:24.193 --> 00:21:28.096]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:21:28.096 --> 00:21:32.480]  You filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:38.384]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:21:38.384 --> 00:21:42.427]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:45.029]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:46.511]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:21:46.511 --> 00:21:47.872]  It's time to take action.
[00:21:47.872 --> 00:21:49.533]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:14.321]  At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at $11 trillion, gold trading around $850 per ounce.
[00:22:15.962 --> 00:22:22.631]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1,600 bronze.
[00:22:22.631 --> 00:22:25.876]  The $20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.

[00:25:48.917 --> 00:25:57.223]  Spain priest with Ebola stable in Madrid hospital.
[00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:57.943]  That's not a typo.
[00:25:57.943 --> 00:26:00.005]  That's the headline from AP.
[00:26:00.005 --> 00:26:01.386]  Spain priest.
[00:26:01.386 --> 00:26:02.086]  Spanish priest.

[00:26:36.675 --> 00:26:39.116]  I want to get on as a guest sometime.
[00:26:39.116 --> 00:26:42.178]  Another article by Michael Snyder on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:42.178 --> 00:26:47.501]  It is becoming clear we are not prepared for an Ebola pandemic.
[00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:51.323]  Yeah, why are they bringing Ebola patients to Germany, Spain, and the U.S.?
[00:26:51.323 --> 00:26:55.866]  Unprecedented, just absolute recklessness when they can't even contain it at hospitals in Africa.
[00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:57.312]  The truth about Ebola.
[00:26:57.312 --> 00:27:02.034]  Paul Joseph Watson on CBS with Dick Morris.
[00:27:02.034 --> 00:27:06.317]  And he breaks down that propaganda.
[00:27:06.317 --> 00:27:17.483]  Paul Joseph Watson joins Dick Morris on his CBS show to discuss how the feds are handling Ebola and media narratives concerning the crisis.
[00:27:17.483 --> 00:27:20.845]  Interesting headline there.
[00:27:20.845 --> 00:27:23.907]  Continuing, too big to fail has not ended.
[00:27:23.907 --> 00:27:25.168]  It's only gotten worse.
[00:27:26.107 --> 00:27:31.993]  Despite mission accomplished announcement, the big giant banks are worse than ever.
[00:27:31.993 --> 00:27:33.835]  This is the stuff I read all day before I go to bed.
[00:27:33.835 --> 00:27:35.236]  I just be so wound up.
[00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:36.657]  Whistleblower!
[00:27:36.657 --> 00:27:40.962]  Fed highly alarmed about Bitcoin conquering dollar system.
[00:27:40.962 --> 00:27:47.568]  Internal report reveals cryptocurrency would supersede existing Fed monopoly within 12 years.
[00:27:50.745 --> 00:27:56.588]  Vladimir Putin signs historic $20 billion oil deal with Iran to bypass Western sanctions.
[00:27:56.588 --> 00:28:02.231]  Russian government will help Iran bring its oil to market.
[00:28:02.231 --> 00:28:04.873]  That's out of the London Telegraph.
[00:28:04.873 --> 00:28:07.854]  Let's move right along to this stack of news.
[00:28:07.854 --> 00:28:08.835]  Afghan official
[00:28:10.017 --> 00:28:13.999]  General's killer hid in a bathroom to kill the Major General.
[00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:20.042]  He opened fire when the General walked into view as part of the country's National Guard trained by the NATO U.S.
[00:28:20.042 --> 00:28:21.944]  forces.
[00:28:21.944 --> 00:28:28.727]  And they said an assault weapon did it in the Associated Press and talked about how deadly they are and how bad they are.
[00:28:28.727 --> 00:28:33.170]  So I guess the answer is take all assault weapons away from the troops.
[00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.291]  They already do that when the Generals and people come around.
[00:28:36.533 --> 00:28:38.896]  I mean, this is the world where even the military can't be trusted.
[00:28:38.896 --> 00:28:40.719]  Only robots can be trusted, you see.
[00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:42.281]  And here's another article.
[00:28:42.281 --> 00:28:46.567]  Store owner says bank accounts closed because he was selling guns.
[00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:50.352]  Daily Caller reports, this is happening all over the country.
[00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.873]  This is happening all over the country where you can't have a gun shop, can't sell guns even legally.
[00:28:56.873 --> 00:28:59.616]  The big banks, everybody, newspapers won't take your ads.
[00:28:59.616 --> 00:29:07.402]  It's total racketeering, organized crime, groups working together to shut down free speech in this country.
[00:29:07.402 --> 00:29:09.044]  It is a big deal.
[00:29:09.044 --> 00:29:16.190]  But meanwhile, actor Bo Bridges praises James Brady's firearms fight, calling it courageous, when pigs like this guy
[00:29:17.335 --> 00:29:20.739]  Have bodyguards on record and own guns in many cases.
[00:29:20.739 --> 00:29:22.141]  Like Michael Moore.
[00:29:22.141 --> 00:29:23.923]  Absolute trash.
[00:29:23.923 --> 00:29:27.927]  Just like all the rest of the Hollywood folks that don't want to pay taxes, but want to raise yours.
[00:29:27.927 --> 00:29:29.729]  Facial recognition to find lost dogs.
[00:29:29.729 --> 00:29:31.531]  I meant to mention this yesterday.
[00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:34.675]  Oh, the face scanners on the streets will be looking for your dog.
[00:29:34.675 --> 00:29:37.018]  Of course, they're tracking everything you do as well.
[00:29:38.584 --> 00:29:39.665]  Oh good, that'll stop crime?
[00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:42.968]  No, the government lets all the criminals basically run free.
[00:29:42.968 --> 00:29:43.469]  A.K.A.
[00:29:43.469 --> 00:29:44.570]  the open border.
[00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.812]  The latest on Ebola when we come back.
[00:29:46.812 --> 00:29:47.933]  The latest on Russia.
[00:29:47.933 --> 00:29:49.034]  The latest on the borders.
[00:29:49.034 --> 00:29:50.755]  The latest on the DOJ.
[00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:51.476]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.476 --> 00:29:52.877]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.877 --> 00:29:54.479]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.479 --> 00:29:55.580]  Your call's coming up.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.142]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.142 --> 00:29:59.904]  Call us on Twitter right now, folks.
[00:29:59.904 --> 00:30:00.604]  RealAlexJones.
[00:30:00.604 --> 00:30:01.065]  It's important.
[00:30:03.328 --> 00:30:04.688]  In the near future.
[00:30:04.688 --> 00:30:08.569]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:30:08.569 --> 00:30:09.169]  Alert.
[00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.889]  Security.
[00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:10.409]  Alert.
[00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:12.410]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:13.290]  Analysis.
[00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.010]  InfoWars.
[00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.111]  Building independent media operations.
[00:30:16.111 --> 00:30:20.992]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:30:20.992 --> 00:30:22.012]  Prime Directive.
[00:30:22.012 --> 00:30:23.572]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:26.433]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:30:26.433 --> 00:30:29.674]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:30:29.674 --> 00:30:31.834]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:30:31.974 --> 00:30:33.475]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:30:33.475 --> 00:30:36.337]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:30:36.337 --> 00:30:38.278]  They are never going to stop.
[00:30:38.278 --> 00:30:42.300]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.903]  Block free iPhone app at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:45.903 --> 00:30:49.265]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:50.245]  Imperative.
[00:30:50.245 --> 00:30:52.307]  Deploy Little Minute TV.
[00:30:52.307 --> 00:30:56.769]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:30:56.769 --> 00:30:59.091]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:31:01.923 --> 00:31:04.324]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:04.324 --> 00:31:07.126]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:31:07.126 --> 00:31:13.310]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:18.392]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:31:18.392 --> 00:31:23.275]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:31:23.275 --> 00:31:27.778]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:31:28.098 --> 00:31:36.681]  The InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:31:36.681 --> 00:31:38.842]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:31:38.842 --> 00:31:50.025]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:31:50.025 --> 00:31:57.428]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.
[00:31:57.668 --> 00:32:02.131]  And find other amazing supplements at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:02.131 --> 00:32:09.295]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:11.636]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:32:11.636 --> 00:32:16.939]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:32:16.939 --> 00:32:21.942]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:32:22.082 --> 00:32:25.423]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:29.485]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:32:29.485 --> 00:32:33.806]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:32:33.806 --> 00:32:44.030]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.951]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[00:32:48.211 --> 00:32:52.693]  Evening last night at half past ten That baby of mine wouldn't let me in So move it on over, move it on over
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.620]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.901]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:43.334 --> 00:33:51.139]  Ladies and gentlemen, what we're seeing happen here with immigration and the open border
[00:34:03.815 --> 00:34:15.021]  Is just the open declaration of war against all law, against all due process, against all fairness and total discrimination.
[00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:24.505]  Just like over 2,000 major globalist companies are tax exempt from the Obamacare mandate.
[00:34:24.505 --> 00:34:29.668]  A hamburger place like McDonald's right next to a mom and pop, McDonald's is exempt.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:41.725]  They can pay their employees more, have lower-priced food, not having the insurance, and put the hamburger place next door to them out of business.
[00:34:41.725 --> 00:34:43.126]  Look at that discrimination.
[00:34:43.126 --> 00:34:49.249]  But healthcare is for the children, even though it's death panels.
[00:34:49.249 --> 00:34:51.070]  It's the same thing with the open borders.
[00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:56.853]  Just legalize whoever they want, whenever they want, by executive action, not even an executive order.
[00:34:58.584 --> 00:35:03.428]  And then Joe Biden and everybody else comes out and says, they're children.
[00:35:03.428 --> 00:35:06.670]  There are children.
[00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.971]  Just like Nancy Pelosi said.
[00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:15.958]  And then we sit here like children ourselves and go, yeah, children from China and Africa and Mexico and Guatemala.
[00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:16.918]  They're ours.
[00:35:16.918 --> 00:35:21.342]  They get here and no, no, who they are is the state's children.
[00:35:21.342 --> 00:35:25.045]  Just like Russia would do in the Soviet Union to be raised.
[00:35:28.407 --> 00:35:34.230]  To literally be bots of the system, just like the Hitler Youth.
[00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.832]  These are not somebody else's kids.
[00:35:36.832 --> 00:35:40.114]  These are our kids.
[00:35:40.114 --> 00:35:47.858]  These are the children that lift the national ambitions of each of these countries aloft.
[00:35:47.858 --> 00:35:50.379]  And, um... He cares so much.
[00:35:50.379 --> 00:35:52.140]  It's a tragedy.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:52.340]  Aww.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:56.643]  For the countries who are losing them, and for us,
[00:35:57.583 --> 00:36:00.844]  Not being able to solve every one of their problems.
[00:36:00.844 --> 00:36:01.984]  Aw, he cares!
[00:36:01.984 --> 00:36:12.548]  We need to take that video clip and just loop it with images of dead kids being bombed by the, quote, US and by Al-Qaeda forces at work for the globalists in Syria.
[00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.851]  And then take another one and just show starving kids in America or kids shot in Chicago.
[00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:19.392]  I mean, it's such a joke.
[00:36:19.392 --> 00:36:28.935]  They're working as hard as they can to break the country, to get rid of our industry, to shut down our power plants, to make us dependent, to sterilize and abort as many kids as they can.
[00:36:31.684 --> 00:36:33.844]  And then he's like, these are our kids.
[00:36:33.844 --> 00:36:41.386]  We're going to get to that news more on Russia, new ISIS news, and a lot more.
[00:36:41.386 --> 00:36:48.207]  But first, we're going to take some of your phone calls, because I want to try to work more calls into the broadcast when we can.
[00:36:48.207 --> 00:36:53.908]  But before I go any further, please don't forget this hour is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com.
[00:36:53.908 --> 00:36:57.309]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[00:36:57.309 --> 00:37:01.230]  And when you go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex, you find really high quality
[00:37:02.264 --> 00:37:11.967]  You know, freshly produced, non-GMO foods, great customer service, 866-229-0927, mypatriotsupply.com, forward slash Alex.
[00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:16.929]  I think you're crazy if you don't have storable foods in these crazy times to shelter in place for whatever else is needed.
[00:37:16.929 --> 00:37:20.610]  And the best part is this insurance you can eat.
[00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:26.492]  Finally, ladies and gentlemen, again, we have this radio show on AM and FM across the country, Global Shortwave.
[00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:43.254]  The Internet, four years, five years on XM Sirius, huge listening audience, very successful there until the Democrats got involved and had a campaign to have us thrown off, which did happen last year, which is fine.
[00:37:43.254 --> 00:37:45.034]  That's what they do.
[00:37:45.034 --> 00:37:47.615]  But people are like, how can you be on this?
[00:37:47.615 --> 00:37:51.035]  Well, I mean, you know, the New World Order didn't like it and got us kicked off.
[00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:52.856]  The point is, don't take this show for granted.
[00:37:53.416 --> 00:37:59.041]  And that's why you should spread the word about every AM and FM station you hear us on.
[00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:08.329]  That's why you should tell people about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the other sites that carry our news, like DrugsReport.com.
[00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:11.652]  That's why you should become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:38:11.652 --> 00:38:18.038]  And if you are a member, this is our platform that's harder for them to censor when we get censored on YouTube and other platforms.
[00:38:18.038 --> 00:38:20.180]  And I've had to file a lawsuit to keep us on YouTube, okay?
[00:38:21.189 --> 00:38:22.229]  People say, well, why'd you do that?
[00:38:22.229 --> 00:38:28.711]  Well, they advertise as an open platform and as a public commons, we follow the rules.
[00:38:28.711 --> 00:38:35.732]  It's our information and your information that makes it of value, like a public swap meet or a farmer's market.
[00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:37.173]  And so it's become a public commons.
[00:38:37.173 --> 00:38:38.693]  And there's some good people at YouTube, by the way.
[00:38:38.693 --> 00:38:39.753]  They're not all bad.
[00:38:39.753 --> 00:38:42.094]  The globalists are obviously on top of it with Google.
[00:38:42.094 --> 00:38:46.535]  But we've had to file lawsuits on people that were trying to kick us off YouTube before.
[00:38:46.535 --> 00:38:48.936]  Just a warning to people that make false claims and stuff.
[00:38:48.936 --> 00:38:49.996]  I mean, I do sue people.
[00:38:51.035 --> 00:38:52.877]  Because I'm going to reach billions.
[00:38:52.877 --> 00:38:53.998]  You have to understand that.
[00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.799]  Or I'm going to die trying.
[00:38:55.799 --> 00:39:02.785]  So when you get in my way, and you actually start stopping me, people that are always trying to get in my way and wonder why I don't sue them is because you didn't draw any blood.
[00:39:02.785 --> 00:39:05.968]  You start drawing blood, high-powered lawyers start suing you.
[00:39:05.968 --> 00:39:08.771]  You start going into depositions, you start getting drugged through court.
[00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:10.672]  Your bank accounts start getting drained.
[00:39:10.672 --> 00:39:12.454]  I don't know why I'm going off on that point.
[00:39:12.454 --> 00:39:13.475]  This is a war, though.
[00:39:15.247 --> 00:39:15.808]  To be on air.
[00:39:15.808 --> 00:39:17.369]  This wasn't easy.
[00:39:17.369 --> 00:39:24.654]  I have clawed and scraped up a muddy hill for 22 years, 19 plus on air.
[00:39:24.654 --> 00:39:26.536]  Two plus years to get on air.
[00:39:26.536 --> 00:39:33.501]  I have climbed through the barbed wire, through the political landscape, to bring people this war against tyranny.
[00:39:33.501 --> 00:39:33.621]  Okay?
[00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:35.302]  And I'm not perfect, but I'm in the fight, folks.
[00:39:35.302 --> 00:39:37.423]  I'm swinging for the fences here.
[00:39:37.423 --> 00:39:38.504]  And I know you realize that.
[00:39:38.504 --> 00:39:39.285]  We're all in this together.
[00:39:41.954 --> 00:39:53.262]  But I need everyone who hasn't become a PrisonPlanet.tv member to see the nightly news, all my films, the commercial-free video, audio, podcast.
[00:39:53.262 --> 00:39:57.345]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, it takes 60 seconds to sign up.
[00:39:57.345 --> 00:40:01.268]  You can get multiple months free when you sign up for a year, or $5.95 a month.
[00:40:01.268 --> 00:40:05.451]  Each membership, each membership,
[00:40:07.293 --> 00:40:08.233]  It's 15 cents a day.
[00:40:08.233 --> 00:40:10.034]  11 people can use it.
[00:40:10.034 --> 00:40:13.295]  So that comes down to a little over a penny a day per person.
[00:40:13.295 --> 00:40:14.836]  Do the math.
[00:40:14.836 --> 00:40:15.356]  So get it.
[00:40:15.356 --> 00:40:16.537]  Get your friends and family to watch.
[00:40:16.537 --> 00:40:17.857]  Download the films you want.
[00:40:17.857 --> 00:40:18.597]  Burn them to disk.
[00:40:18.597 --> 00:40:21.358]  A lot of other films have been authorized to be posted on there.
[00:40:21.358 --> 00:40:22.299]  This is our place.
[00:40:23.567 --> 00:40:28.511]  Okay, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:35.237]  These are our operations to then flood the enemy transmission sites with our information.
[00:40:35.237 --> 00:40:38.881]  We jack in to the mind control matrix through these ports.
[00:40:40.302 --> 00:40:42.483]  But our ports are under attack.
[00:40:42.483 --> 00:40:47.425]  Our ports we have to pour money into to keep up and deal with the dirty tricks and the sabotage and the rest of it.
[00:40:47.425 --> 00:40:48.605]  You never hear about it.
[00:40:48.605 --> 00:40:58.689]  So realize it is a war and these are gun emplacements firing on enemy forces, blowing their major capital ships into burning hulks.
[00:40:59.269 --> 00:41:01.291]  We are smashing through their lies.
[00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:03.694]  We are overrunning their positions.
[00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.576]  Because the enemy is pathetic.
[00:41:05.576 --> 00:41:10.121]  Their whole program is to attack mesmerized, unconscious zombies.
[00:41:14.537 --> 00:41:16.158]  Anyone can fight them.
[00:41:16.158 --> 00:41:22.083]  Truth stands up if it's said by a little old lady on crutches who's had a stroke and can hardly talk.
[00:41:22.083 --> 00:41:28.748]  Her utterance of the New World Orders of fraud and evil and anti-human and anti-God shakes it to its core.
[00:41:28.748 --> 00:41:31.250]  It tells you you don't have power because you do have power.
[00:41:33.143 --> 00:41:44.585]  So I want to see everyone go and become PrisonPlanet.tv members and I want to see you download the material off of it and make hard copies and create backup archives and libraries in your home for what's coming in the future.
[00:41:45.814 --> 00:41:47.554]  And to put it on AXS television.
[00:41:47.554 --> 00:41:48.955]  A lot of TV stations.
[00:41:48.955 --> 00:41:50.295]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:41:50.295 --> 00:41:50.975]  You're authorized.
[00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:51.935]  You've been doing it.
[00:41:51.935 --> 00:41:57.557]  We've got a form on there that authorizes it for commercial TV or for AXS TV, whatever.
[00:41:57.557 --> 00:41:58.777]  Just download the nightly news.
[00:41:58.777 --> 00:42:00.117]  Put it on your TV station.
[00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.657]  People are doing that all over.
[00:42:01.657 --> 00:42:03.738]  They're not waiting for orders from headquarters.
[00:42:03.738 --> 00:42:04.838]  There is no headquarters.
[00:42:04.838 --> 00:42:06.318]  That's why we cannot be stopped.
[00:42:06.318 --> 00:42:07.319]  We have the truth.
[00:42:07.319 --> 00:42:10.920]  We have God on our side if we take action.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.920]  So again, become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.361]  Do it today.
[00:42:15.361 --> 00:42:17.062]  Go to Infowarslife.com.
[00:42:17.062 --> 00:42:20.025]  Try the X2 super nascent iodine.
[00:42:20.025 --> 00:42:27.932]  Try the super male vitality, the super female vitality that goes in and blocks all these artificial hormones they've been adding to our food and water.
[00:42:27.932 --> 00:42:32.116]  It helps your body create its own natural enzymes and things.
[00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:33.717]  Just go research the information.
[00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.319]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.760]  Fuel our operation.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.161]  Midair refueling.
[00:42:38.161 --> 00:42:39.863]  Fuel us and you get this commitment.
[00:42:40.748 --> 00:42:52.133]  You will get absolute Americana love of liberty, love of justice, love of stomping on tyrants, savage attack on the New World Order, 110% going in.
[00:42:52.133 --> 00:42:54.894]  You want an information warfare kamikaze attack?
[00:42:54.894 --> 00:42:57.315]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:57.315 --> 00:43:04.558]  And believe me, we've already flown through the enemy repeatedly, and we only get stronger on the other side every time we ram up against the enemy.
[00:43:05.694 --> 00:43:12.555]  They can be absolutely destroyed if we find our soul, our heart again, and repent.
[00:43:12.555 --> 00:43:17.476]  And stop using evil systems of thought, evil systems of manipulation.
[00:43:17.476 --> 00:43:21.697]  And just straight forward, shoot straight in life, that's what it's all about.
[00:43:21.697 --> 00:43:24.078]  And that means telling the truth about the New World Order.
[00:43:24.078 --> 00:43:31.219]  It's bad for everybody, even the technocrats at top that think they're become god men and are going to merge with the cybernetic interfaces.
[00:43:35.106 --> 00:43:41.911]  So again, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfowarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:43.072]  We fund our operation.
[00:43:43.072 --> 00:43:49.957]  We're expanding our operation the old-fashioned way by selling high-quality products at extremely low prices, and we appreciate your support.
[00:43:49.957 --> 00:43:55.361]  High-quality water filters that cut out the fluoride, the glyphosates, and the rest of it at the lowest price out there.
[00:43:55.361 --> 00:43:56.381]  Promo code WATER, 10% off.
[00:43:57.878 --> 00:44:05.223]  And then you get a great water filter that I personally use, that you've heard the rave reviews, that cuts out almost everything, and then you support the transmission.
[00:44:05.223 --> 00:44:07.684]  Win, win, win, win.
[00:44:07.684 --> 00:44:09.165]  Winning.
[00:44:09.165 --> 00:44:11.127]  Symbiotic relationships.
[00:44:11.127 --> 00:44:13.388]  That's what we're about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:13.388 --> 00:44:14.949]  And we will defend your rights.
[00:44:14.949 --> 00:44:16.330]  You will defend our rights.
[00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:17.291]  I am with you.
[00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:18.191]  You are with me.
[00:44:18.191 --> 00:44:18.912]  It's real simple.
[00:44:21.488 --> 00:44:26.309]  I love workin' hard, I love fightin' tyrants, but I mean, I'll be honest, I would never commit suicide, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:27.329]  I love life so much.
[00:44:27.329 --> 00:44:28.950]  But I'll be quite honest with people.
[00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:31.390]  Somebody walks up to me in public and blows my brains out?
[00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:34.191]  You just got me off work, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:44:34.191 --> 00:44:36.051]  You think I'm afraid of any of it?
[00:44:36.051 --> 00:44:37.991]  I'm afraid of nothing other than failing.
[00:44:37.991 --> 00:44:39.912]  I'm afraid of not being a good person.
[00:44:39.912 --> 00:44:43.052]  I'm afraid of my soul not being lined up, pointed at God.
[00:44:43.052 --> 00:44:45.273]  And I'm afraid of not going with God.
[00:44:45.273 --> 00:44:46.873]  Vaya con Dios.
[00:44:46.873 --> 00:44:48.274]  That's all I'm afraid of.
[00:44:48.274 --> 00:44:49.134]  I'm free!
[00:44:49.134 --> 00:44:50.314]  Has anybody figured that out yet?
[00:44:54.246 --> 00:44:59.772]  New World Order kills me, all they've done is punched me out of work.
[00:44:59.772 --> 00:45:02.494]  And people say, don't tell them what you're afraid of.
[00:45:02.494 --> 00:45:04.977]  Obviously, I don't want to be in a torture camp.
[00:45:04.977 --> 00:45:07.960]  Obviously, I don't want to be kept for 30 years in a dungeon.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.143]  But if that's the cost, I tell you, I'm not afraid to die.
[00:45:11.143 --> 00:45:12.404]  I'm afraid of that.
[00:45:12.404 --> 00:45:13.105]  And I'm ready!
[00:45:13.105 --> 00:45:13.606]  I'm ready!
[00:45:13.606 --> 00:45:14.987]  I'm ready for it all!
[00:45:14.987 --> 00:45:17.590]  You can even destroy my mind, you'll never get my soul!
[00:45:19.093 --> 00:45:23.095]  You think God counts it when you torture somebody into giving up?
[00:45:23.095 --> 00:45:23.475]  No!
[00:45:23.475 --> 00:45:24.776]  Those people go right to God!
[00:45:24.776 --> 00:45:27.897]  And that's where I want to be for eternity in the universe!
[00:45:27.897 --> 00:45:30.178]  And all the things God's got ready for us!
[00:45:30.178 --> 00:45:31.299]  All the great adventures!
[00:45:31.299 --> 00:45:32.379]  This is only the beginning!
[00:45:32.379 --> 00:45:34.240]  This is only boot camp!
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.603]  And I want to come out of here with an A-plus!
[00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:39.543]  You understand that?
[00:45:39.543 --> 00:45:41.004]  This isn't a game, people!
[00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:42.584]  This is the real deal!
[00:45:42.584 --> 00:45:47.327]  Alright, let's go ahead and take a couple of these phone calls and then...
[00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:53.113]  Department of Justice report says regions near Mexico border most crime ridden in the U.S.
[00:45:53.113 --> 00:45:55.315]  except for Chicago.
[00:45:55.315 --> 00:46:00.618]  Everywhere run by the evil New World Order is a cesspit of pain because that's what they like.
[00:46:00.618 --> 00:46:03.120]  They're pointed at their God.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.361]  They've gone with their God.
[00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:07.023]  They've gone with the devil.
[00:46:07.023 --> 00:46:11.706]  How do you say that in Spanish?
[00:46:11.706 --> 00:46:14.288]  Visa con Dios?
[00:46:14.288 --> 00:46:15.149]  Go with God?
[00:46:15.149 --> 00:46:16.690]  Vaya con Satanás.
[00:46:18.271 --> 00:46:20.712]  Yeah, that's their slogan.
[00:46:20.712 --> 00:46:27.254]  Vaya... Vaya... Sounds better to say Vaya con Diablo.
[00:46:27.254 --> 00:46:29.754]  Yeah, Vaya con Diablo.
[00:46:29.754 --> 00:46:30.875]  Yeah, not me!
[00:46:30.875 --> 00:46:32.235]  No!
[00:46:32.235 --> 00:46:33.575]  No!
[00:46:33.575 --> 00:46:35.856]  Not going with Diablo.
[00:46:35.856 --> 00:46:39.017]  Because I got enough Diablo in me to know where that really goes.
[00:46:39.017 --> 00:46:42.238]  And let me tell you something, I'm not signing on to any of that.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.361]  Devil sells it like a hot cheerleader with a devil tail.
[00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:50.383]  That's not what the devil's like.
[00:46:50.383 --> 00:46:55.585]  At the bottom of a spider hole, there's a big mean spider gonna suck your soul out.
[00:46:55.585 --> 00:46:59.247]  Nothing but pain and anguish and dishonor and weakness.
[00:46:59.247 --> 00:47:03.349]  I don't want any part of it!
[00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:04.370]  I'm not even getting to the news yet.
[00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:06.171]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls like I said I would.
[00:47:06.171 --> 00:47:08.792]  Let's talk to Dakota in Nevada.
[00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:09.453]  You're on the air.
[00:47:09.453 --> 00:47:10.793]  Go ahead.
[00:47:10.793 --> 00:47:11.234]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:12.761 --> 00:47:30.838]  I want to talk about the pressure that's being set by the police not following the Constitution and where that points us as people and how we're expected, you know, to lay down our arms if the police can't even protect us, then who's left?
[00:47:33.356 --> 00:47:43.260]  Well, no, that's the breakdown of society, and that's why you see sheriffs and police chiefs everywhere with a look of manliness on their faces, but concerned, their eyes wide open, their eyes focused.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.161]  Black sheriffs, Hispanic sheriffs, white sheriffs, you name it, police chiefs everywhere.
[00:47:47.161 --> 00:47:57.605]  There was more yesterday, saying the government is creating lawlessness, there is a crime wave, buy guns, defend yourselves, always carry a gun, go out and get basic training with it.
[00:47:57.605 --> 00:48:00.206]  You know, we're with you because they care about humanity.
[00:48:01.135 --> 00:48:04.737]  You're going to see cops say, we're going to defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:48:04.737 --> 00:48:06.598]  We know evil's taking over.
[00:48:06.598 --> 00:48:09.919]  Or they're going to say, I don't care, I can do whatever I want.
[00:48:09.919 --> 00:48:16.063]  You're going to see those two things happen as America circles the black hole.
[00:48:16.063 --> 00:48:21.985]  As we go faster and faster and faster into that vortex.
[00:48:21.985 --> 00:48:26.368]  So, I mean, places like Chicago and New York are just going to collapse.
[00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:31.912]  And then the suburbs will be fine in Chicago, they've got the actual middle class people.
[00:48:31.912 --> 00:48:35.553]  In Chicago, one area is nice and safe, the next area is a living hell.
[00:48:35.553 --> 00:48:37.194]  You're just going to see compartmentalization.
[00:48:37.194 --> 00:48:38.934]  L.A.'
[00:48:38.914 --> 00:48:41.995]  's going to collapse, it already is collapsing.
[00:48:41.995 --> 00:48:43.516]  It's just, it's already burning.
[00:48:43.516 --> 00:48:51.219]  I mean, last time I was in L.A., I was sitting there, literally, at somebody's house.
[00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:54.060]  In this big swimming pool, with a butler bringing me iced tea.
[00:48:58.267 --> 00:49:05.132]  With women laid out in bikinis, with ash raining down.
[00:49:05.132 --> 00:49:09.455]  And the time I'd been there before at a movie star's house, there was ash raining down that time.
[00:49:09.455 --> 00:49:10.996]  I mean, ash like hell.
[00:49:10.996 --> 00:49:14.318]  And as I flew in, the city was burning all over.
[00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:18.441]  And you could just feel the spirit of the town.
[00:49:18.441 --> 00:49:20.482]  The saint of Los Angeles.
[00:49:20.482 --> 00:49:23.524]  El Diablo.
[00:49:23.524 --> 00:49:25.345]  And I was like, this is hell.
[00:49:25.345 --> 00:49:26.286]  I need to get out of here.
[00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:34.013]  And I've been invited out there literally 50 times since then or more, and I've not gone.
[00:49:34.013 --> 00:49:35.314]  No, no, no.
[00:49:35.314 --> 00:49:38.156]  I will not set foot in Los Angeles.
[00:49:38.156 --> 00:49:39.797]  I mean, it is a real spirit of evil.
[00:49:39.797 --> 00:49:41.238]  You don't feel it in Santa Cruz.
[00:49:41.238 --> 00:49:42.699]  You don't feel it in San Diego.
[00:49:42.699 --> 00:49:45.000]  You don't even feel it in San Francisco.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.722]  You feel it in L.A., man.
[00:49:47.722 --> 00:49:49.043]  I will not get near it.
[00:49:49.043 --> 00:49:50.084]  Anyways, anything else, caller?
[00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:59.477]  I just had one more question and that's how far do you think this is going to go before anybody wakes up?
[00:49:59.477 --> 00:50:00.838]  Bioweapons being released.
[00:50:00.838 --> 00:50:03.940]  I don't know if it's this with Ebola, probably not.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:04.761]  Billions dead.
[00:50:04.761 --> 00:50:05.962]  World government.
[00:50:05.962 --> 00:50:06.343]  Robot.
[00:50:07.082 --> 00:50:09.925]  Robots on the streets, drones flying around with taser guns.
[00:50:09.925 --> 00:50:12.748]  Told people about that 15 years ago, it's now rolled out.
[00:50:12.748 --> 00:50:17.834]  Just armored vehicles, disease, almost complete infertility in the population.
[00:50:17.834 --> 00:50:24.541]  It'll just exponentially grow in the decades to come until, if God doesn't intervene, no flesh will be spared.
[00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:28.244]  And Joel Olsteen will be on TV the whole time.
[00:50:28.244 --> 00:50:29.265]  Name it and claim it.
[00:50:29.265 --> 00:50:36.189]  And the big mega-churches will have their counselors telling their wives to divorce their husbands and worship the government.
[00:50:36.189 --> 00:50:38.711]  It'll just be absolute Satanism in the streets.
[00:50:38.711 --> 00:50:43.554]  Does that answer your question?
[00:50:43.554 --> 00:50:44.154]  Absolutely.
[00:50:44.154 --> 00:50:44.735]  Thank you, sir.
[00:50:44.735 --> 00:50:46.436]  Appreciate your call.
[00:50:46.436 --> 00:50:47.757]  We're going to go to Jordan.
[00:50:49.156 --> 00:50:51.821]  And Zach and John and Rob and others.
[00:50:51.821 --> 00:50:53.705]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:56.310]  We'll just continue steaming forward with your calls.
[00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:59.857]  We have a special guest joining us on the Global Meltdown and more.
[00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:00.298]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:04.692]  Adam Miller here with Midas Resources.
[00:51:04.692 --> 00:51:06.294]  Today, August 6th, 2014, gold opened at $1308.50.
[00:51:06.294 --> 00:51:09.819]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $13.56, $6.78 for a half ounce, or $3.39 for a quarter ounce.
[00:51:09.819 --> 00:51:10.279]  That's $13.56, $6.78, and $3.39.
[00:51:21.383 --> 00:51:22.564]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:22.564 --> 00:51:27.948]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:51:27.948 --> 00:51:28.829]  Wait a sec.
[00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:33.232]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next debt increase.
[00:51:33.232 --> 00:51:34.954]  And there's no end to this madness.
[00:51:34.954 --> 00:51:40.138]  That old 401k and IRA can be converted into physical gold without tax consequences.
[00:51:40.718 --> 00:51:43.641]  I explained this in my book, 10 Reasons to Buy Gold.

[00:52:02.236 --> 00:52:05.077]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:05.077 --> 00:52:10.178]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:10.178 --> 00:52:18.299]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:18.299 --> 00:52:22.820]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.621]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:26.801 --> 00:52:32.745]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:32.745 --> 00:52:35.907]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:35.907 --> 00:52:41.291]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:16.154]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[00:54:16.154 --> 00:54:22.096]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:44.590]  We're going to go right back to your phone calls, and then Bill Bonner, who's a famous entrepreneur, famous best-selling author, is going to be joining us about his new book that's coming out.
[00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:48.853]  He's a two-time New York Times best-selling author, historian, economist, entrepreneur.
[00:54:48.853 --> 00:54:53.596]  You see him on television a lot as an analyst, and he's going to be joining us
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:02.184]  To give us a global view on the economy and where the world is going.
[00:55:02.184 --> 00:55:03.865]  Hey guys, I had his book in here last week.
[00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:07.488]  Will somebody find that for me or get me the info on his book?
[00:55:07.488 --> 00:55:09.589]  So that we can break that down when he comes on with us.
[00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:12.491]  I know he doesn't really want to come on about the book, but I want to talk about that some.
[00:55:12.491 --> 00:55:13.251]  Thank you.
[00:55:13.251 --> 00:55:14.012]  That's coming up.
[00:55:14.012 --> 00:55:21.957]  And then we have joining us as well, Joel Skousen, who's also lived all over the world and is an expert on pandemics and strategic relocation.
[00:55:23.035 --> 00:55:26.636]  Not even so much saying this Ebola is going to become a pandemic here in the U.S.
[00:55:26.636 --> 00:55:33.899]  Obviously Africa already has a tragedy, but what would another bioweapon or something getting out look like?
[00:55:33.899 --> 00:55:35.559]  What would the panicking look like?
[00:55:35.559 --> 00:55:41.682]  Hey, re-pull me that article from yesterday about, I think it was 30 things you need to know about the Ebola thing, and then I've got another one today.
[00:55:41.682 --> 00:55:44.343]  I want to go over that with him in the third hour today.
[00:55:44.343 --> 00:55:45.723]  Let's go back to your calls.
[00:55:45.723 --> 00:55:47.644]  Jordan in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:48.024]  Go ahead.
[00:55:49.192 --> 00:55:53.977]  Well, first off, I just want to let you know I'm a former SEER instructor in the United States Air Force.
[00:55:53.977 --> 00:56:00.264]  For those listeners that don't know, a SEER instructor is a survival, evasion, resistance, and escape specialist.
[00:56:00.264 --> 00:56:04.729]  What we do is we teach people how to survive in the woods if they were to go down behind enemy lines.
[00:56:05.149 --> 00:56:05.650]  I don't know.
[00:56:25.189 --> 00:56:28.652]  All the soldiers that were with him have clearly said that he was a deserter.
[00:56:28.652 --> 00:56:30.913]  He left a note saying that he was leaving.
[00:56:30.913 --> 00:56:34.236]  Why is this even being allowed to go forward?
[00:56:34.236 --> 00:56:38.559]  Why is he not being hung on the steps of the National Mall?
[00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:44.223]  I mean, that's what is called for in the UCNJ when you commit treason.
[00:56:44.223 --> 00:56:46.525]  Well, that's interesting, sir.
[00:56:46.525 --> 00:56:47.786]  Where do you see all this going?
[00:56:50.218 --> 00:56:51.219]  World War III.
[00:56:51.219 --> 00:56:55.981]  I mean, with everything that's going on in Russia and Ukraine right now, Obama is pissing Putin off.
[00:56:55.981 --> 00:56:57.141]  It is not looking good.
[00:56:57.141 --> 00:57:02.743]  He is having, you know, a unit-measuring contest, so to say, right now with Putin.
[00:57:02.743 --> 00:57:05.845]  All the thing that's going on in Africa is Ebola, man.
[00:57:05.845 --> 00:57:08.206]  It's scaring the ever-loving crap out of me.
[00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:14.174]  It's going to global war, is what they're trying to do.
[00:57:14.174 --> 00:57:21.180]  I see by 2016, martial law is definitely going to be declared so that Obama will try to stay in office.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.342]  And once that happens, civil war will erupt.
[00:57:24.342 --> 00:57:28.286]  Other countries will see us as weak and then they'll move in and try to swoop in on us while we're weak.
[00:57:29.039 --> 00:57:39.266]  Well I know this, a major time of global change is upon us and that's why the Chinese are saying they're going to grab the Philippines or areas of it and parts of Japan that Japan claims are their islands.
[00:57:39.266 --> 00:57:42.529]  That's why you see Al-Qaeda moving into Africa under IS.
[00:57:42.529 --> 00:57:45.150]  That's why you see the West moving into Ukraine.
[00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:48.132]  It's why you see all these new alliances being made in the BRICS.
[00:57:48.132 --> 00:57:50.174]  It's why you see Homeland Security clamping down.
[00:57:51.855 --> 00:58:01.339]  We're going into a mafia-based economy, and the military admits they're getting ready for collapse, but the troops are being told, oh, we don't know why this happened.
[00:58:01.339 --> 00:58:15.004]  No, we've been maneuvered into this position under Agenda 21, and again, Cloward and Piven is only one aspect, or one university perspective, on how to wreck the country to make us domestic.
[00:58:15.004 --> 00:58:17.845]  Slaves.
[00:58:17.845 --> 00:58:19.026]  And that's what this has come down to.
[00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:27.376]  We can sit here and look at all the different angles, all the different parts, all of it all day, and have excuses for why they do this or why they do that.
[00:58:27.376 --> 00:58:29.638]  Bottom line, the Globalists want to wreck this society.
[00:58:29.638 --> 00:58:30.759]  To control us.
[00:58:30.759 --> 00:58:32.321]  That's how they politically dominate us.
[00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:34.162]  It's a form of siege.
[00:58:34.162 --> 00:58:35.924]  John, you're up next.
[00:58:35.924 --> 00:58:39.847]  Then, Zach, Rob, Jeff, and many others.
[00:58:39.847 --> 00:58:42.810]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:44.632]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:52.404 --> 00:58:56.227]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:58:56.227 --> 00:58:57.469]  I mean, I taste dirt in it.
[00:58:57.469 --> 00:58:58.810]  God knows what's in there.
[00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:03.034]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:59:03.034 --> 00:59:08.779]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:59:08.939 --> 00:59:09.999]  That one is better.
[00:59:09.999 --> 00:59:11.239]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:59:11.239 --> 00:59:12.680]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.320]  It's good water.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:19.281]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:59:19.281 --> 00:59:26.522]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:59:26.522 --> 00:59:29.223]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:59:29.223 --> 00:59:37.144]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:59:37.304 --> 00:59:38.904]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:59:38.904 --> 00:59:39.525]  Good water.
[00:59:39.525 --> 00:59:40.105]  Refreshing.
[00:59:40.105 --> 00:59:40.745]  It's good!

[01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:14.668]  You want answers?
[01:00:14.668 --> 01:00:16.210]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:20.415]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.415 --> 01:00:24.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.735 --> 01:00:33.617]  Hey Alex, I feel like a first time caller.
[01:00:59.153 --> 01:01:02.574]  I think the last time I got in was, like, 99 or something.
[01:01:02.574 --> 01:01:07.434]  Yeah, I think if you haven't called in in 15 years, I think that counts as a first-time caller.
[01:01:07.434 --> 01:01:13.956]  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to get in, but that's okay because everybody's waking up.
[01:01:13.956 --> 01:01:18.996]  Hey, you remember a time when the news come on?
[01:01:18.996 --> 01:01:26.578]  I remember, you know, coming home from school and you'd have so-and-so in Saigon and so-and-so in Paris reporting this.
[01:01:26.578 --> 01:01:27.618]  Do you remember that?
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.861]  Yes, I do.
[01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:35.946]  Yeah, and I don't want, and nowadays, I mean, that was gone a long time ago.
[01:01:35.946 --> 01:01:40.650]  Nowadays, you know, it's all propaganda stuff.
[01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:45.154]  Oh yeah, now there's hardly ever reporters there in the field are telling you what's happening.
[01:01:45.154 --> 01:01:49.438]  It's always just press releases that have no reflection of reality.
[01:01:50.322 --> 01:01:57.949]  That's right, and I won't keep you any longer, but you guys, that's why I like listening to you.
[01:01:57.949 --> 01:02:03.695]  You've progressed so much, and you're sending reporters into the field.
[01:02:03.695 --> 01:02:04.856]  That is excellent.
[01:02:05.387 --> 01:02:07.948]  Well, brother, you take up our time anytime.
[01:02:07.948 --> 01:02:10.708]  Thank you and spread the word there on 1140 AM.
[01:02:10.708 --> 01:02:11.788]  Big station.
[01:02:11.788 --> 01:02:13.649]  Huge audience in Kansas City.
[01:02:13.649 --> 01:02:15.589]  God bless you, John.
[01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:19.590]  Let's go ahead and go to Rob in Maine.
[01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:20.490]  Rob, you're on the air.
[01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:23.411]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[01:02:23.411 --> 01:02:26.291]  Hey, brother.
[01:02:26.291 --> 01:02:29.852]  I do a show up here on Public Access TV, Portland, Maine.
[01:02:29.852 --> 01:02:30.572]  We salute you.
[01:02:30.572 --> 01:02:31.753]  Blues and blues.
[01:02:31.753 --> 01:02:32.233]  We salute you.
[01:02:32.233 --> 01:02:32.393]  12 years.
[01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:40.204]  And, uh, we got turned on to a lot of the truth by you.
[01:02:40.204 --> 01:02:43.686]  And, uh, thanks for having me on.
[01:02:43.686 --> 01:02:44.467]  You bet, brother.
[01:02:44.467 --> 01:02:48.990]  Hey, tell folks, are you taking your show and putting it on YouTube?
[01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:54.213]  I record it and then send it in to the... I do put it on YouTube as well, yeah.
[01:02:54.213 --> 01:02:59.316]  No, exactly, because everybody that does access television and still has huge audiences in most areas,
[01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:08.065]  I wanted to ask you if you had heard about Dr. Rima Labo saying that nano silver would neutralize Ebola virus or kill it.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.761]  Well, I know she's a prestigious medical doctor.
[01:03:25.761 --> 01:03:27.922]  We've had her on off and on over the years.
[01:03:27.922 --> 01:03:33.344]  She's married to the former head of Special Forces and then the head of Special Army Operations.
[01:03:33.344 --> 01:03:33.604]  You name it.
[01:03:33.604 --> 01:03:35.985]  I think it was like a two, three-star general.
[01:03:35.985 --> 01:03:37.025]  General Stubblebine.
[01:03:37.025 --> 01:03:39.046]  Amazing information.
[01:03:39.046 --> 01:03:41.507]  They made movies about him.
[01:03:41.507 --> 01:03:44.228]  And George Clooney, I think, played him.
[01:03:44.228 --> 01:03:49.250]  But the whole point is that, yes, I'm not a medical doctor, so I can't say that.
[01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:52.091]  I know that I couldn't get rid of a chest infection
[01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:57.868]  That killed my uncle, almost killed my dad, killed my cousin, and killed my dad's...
[01:03:58.945 --> 01:04:01.527]  Older cousin, who he called his uncle, who I was very close to.
[01:04:01.527 --> 01:04:05.310]  And this was killing people all over the country, but it wasn't on the news.
[01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:08.934]  And I drank three bottles of nano-silver in one week.
[01:04:08.934 --> 01:04:12.276]  I'm not telling people to do that, because some people could say that could be toxic.
[01:04:12.276 --> 01:04:12.657]  You know what?
[01:04:12.657 --> 01:04:14.238]  It finally knocked it out, and I'm here.
[01:04:14.238 --> 01:04:18.842]  I mean, I had a chest cold for two months.
[01:04:18.842 --> 01:04:22.305]  And some people in my family thought it was like a selected bio-attack or something.
[01:04:22.305 --> 01:04:23.846]  It was so bad.
[01:04:23.846 --> 01:04:25.588]  But, so, yeah, I mean, I respect her.
[01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.171]  Well, okay, good.
[01:04:29.171 --> 01:04:39.515]  She says it was actually discovered by the United States, some form of their government, one of the medical departments or whatever, and then suppressed back in 2009.
[01:04:41.038 --> 01:04:41.819]  Yeah, no, that's true.
[01:04:41.819 --> 01:04:42.979]  I mean, she'd be the one to know.
[01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:54.226]  I mean, General Stubblebine had about as high a level security clearance as you could get, even connected in to the National Security Council above the Joint Chiefs Show.
[01:04:54.226 --> 01:04:58.309]  And he can't talk about most of it, but it's just fantastic information.
[01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:59.349]  Thank you so much, caller.
[01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.870]  God bless you.
[01:05:02.734 --> 01:05:04.956]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:05:04.956 --> 01:05:13.024]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:05:13.024 --> 01:05:20.152]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:05:20.552 --> 01:05:25.156]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:05:25.156 --> 01:05:35.785]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:05:35.785 --> 01:05:42.290]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:44.512]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:05:44.512 --> 01:05:48.475]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[01:05:48.655 --> 01:05:50.597]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:05:50.597 --> 01:05:54.760]  All the products in Infowarslife.com are simply amazing.

[01:06:02.786 --> 01:06:08.950]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:13.514]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:06:13.514 --> 01:06:18.077]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:06:18.457 --> 01:06:21.399]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:06:21.399 --> 01:06:26.864]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:06:26.864 --> 01:06:34.229]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[01:06:34.229 --> 01:06:38.372]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:06:38.372 --> 01:06:43.156]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:43.476 --> 01:06:52.084]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:06:52.084 --> 01:06:56.368]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:07:02.443 --> 01:07:06.084]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:07:06.084 --> 01:07:10.366]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:07:10.366 --> 01:07:12.146]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:07:12.146 --> 01:07:20.009]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:07:20.009 --> 01:07:21.150]  But for how long?
[01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:27.792]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:07:27.792 --> 01:07:30.613]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:39.831]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:11.776]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:11.776 --> 01:08:14.742]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:43.134]  That's right, coming to you from deep behind enemy lines in an occupied country by more and more socialist progressives who don't want to pay taxes themselves like Warren Buffett and others, they just want to get banker bailouts and then promote taxes on the middle class.
[01:08:43.134 --> 01:08:50.416]  People like Bill Gates, people like Robert Redford, ladies and gentlemen, makes me want to throw up that we've got so many
[01:08:52.421 --> 01:09:03.412]  Really rich people that made money in the American system and now they want more of a monopolistic system based on government control and they are destroying our republic.
[01:09:04.198 --> 01:09:10.764]  Coming up in a few minutes we're going to talk to Bill Bonner who has got another book coming out that's destined to be a bestseller.
[01:09:10.764 --> 01:09:14.048]  He's had two New York Times top bestsellers.
[01:09:14.048 --> 01:09:17.491]  Hormageddon, How Too Much of a Good Thing Leads to Disaster.
[01:09:17.491 --> 01:09:22.195]  We're going to be talking to him for the balance of the hour here in just a few minutes.
[01:09:22.195 --> 01:09:23.477]  The Department of Justice
[01:09:25.854 --> 01:09:34.297]  Is now saying regions near the Mexico border, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California have the highest crime rate in the country.
[01:09:34.297 --> 01:09:37.559]  And that's now spreading deeper into the nation.
[01:09:37.559 --> 01:09:44.201]  The Daily Mail reports, I will not rest until these worthless pieces of bleep are dead.
[01:09:44.201 --> 01:09:50.004]  Anguished mother who watched two of her family members killed.
[01:09:51.383 --> 01:10:08.154]  Vows to get justice, and the people that reportedly ambushed her husband and son and gunned them down, that killed Mrs. Vega's son and husband on a fishing trip, had been deported six times for other violent crimes.
[01:10:08.154 --> 01:10:14.158]  And Obama released, just a few months ago, 36,000 violent felons.
[01:10:14.158 --> 01:10:16.039]  Won't even deport them now.
[01:10:16.039 --> 01:10:19.962]  Rapists, child molesters, bank robbers, arsonists.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:24.363]  But if they catch you speeding, folks, they're going to throw the book at you.
[01:10:24.363 --> 01:10:28.206]  TSA's got to check your baby's diaper to make sure there's not a bomb in there.
[01:10:28.206 --> 01:10:37.455]  Meanwhile, more of the ISIS forces, trained by NATO and our government, that have been turned loose all over the Middle East, are in Iraq now, after being repulsed out of Syria.
[01:10:37.455 --> 01:10:43.540]  Iraq militants seize Christian towns, capture follows withdrawals from towns by Kurdish forces.
[01:10:44.537 --> 01:10:49.641]  And Obama for three months will not attack these Al-Qaeda forces that they armed.
[01:10:49.641 --> 01:10:54.705]  Rebels have captured last week the largest dam and are threatening to flood Baghdad.
[01:10:54.705 --> 01:11:00.449]  This is the total crazy town stuff that is going on.
[01:11:00.449 --> 01:11:03.232]  And again, our government is directly involved.
[01:11:03.232 --> 01:11:05.073]  Of course, you can't even call it our government.
[01:11:05.073 --> 01:11:07.855]  The globalists that are involved.
[01:11:07.855 --> 01:11:10.557]  One more piece of news, we're going to our prestigious guest.
[01:11:10.557 --> 01:11:12.419]  No Ebola drugs for Africans.
[01:11:13.894 --> 01:11:29.213]  Says the UN and the CDC, that's out of Breitbart, no drugs for Africans, even though they've got a bunch of drugs that have been tested and proven to reduce the 90 plus percent kill rate, 91 percent kill rate of Ebola in Africa, cutting it down to less than 50 percent.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.982]  And that would help stop the spread of it, wouldn't it?
[01:11:33.982 --> 01:11:35.022]  But, no.
[01:11:35.022 --> 01:11:39.145]  Instead they're shipping Ebola victims into Spain, into Germany, and into the U.S.
[01:11:39.145 --> 01:11:42.188]  Now they're talking about bringing even more in.
[01:11:42.188 --> 01:11:43.809]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:11:43.809 --> 01:11:46.391]  They can't contain it in Africa, so let's bring it in here.
[01:11:46.391 --> 01:11:48.332]  That's never before been done.
[01:11:48.332 --> 01:11:53.035]  Russia has strategic bombers conducting more than 16 incursions of U.S.
[01:11:53.035 --> 01:11:58.579]  air defense zones, spike in Bear H flights over past week, seen as test of U.S.
[01:11:58.579 --> 01:11:58.699]  air
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:07.485]  As the new Cold War kicks off and Russia is becoming more capitalist than us in many cases.
[01:12:07.485 --> 01:12:12.388]  And I'm not saying Russia is our hope or that Russia is some pantheon or paragon of justice.
[01:12:12.388 --> 01:12:14.730]  No!
[01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:17.492]  Communist China is about as evil as it gets their government.
[01:12:17.492 --> 01:12:19.213]  Our government loves their systems.
[01:12:20.798 --> 01:12:22.980]  And so we're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.942]  I mean, we are in so much trouble in my view, and I'm not being negative.
[01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:31.167]  I want to be honest about where we're at and talk to the experts out there who pretty much agree across the board.
[01:12:31.167 --> 01:12:44.498]  We're entering a mega age of crisis with technological sub-singularities building towards perfect storm cluster events that will decide the future of humanity.
[01:12:44.498 --> 01:12:46.699]  This is the time to be politically involved.
[01:12:46.699 --> 01:12:48.261]  This is the time to be repenting.
[01:12:49.602 --> 01:12:53.384]  And to be getting involved for justice everywhere we can.
[01:12:53.384 --> 01:13:01.029]  And for sanity and cooler heads that prevail in governments, in capitals, everywhere.
[01:13:01.029 --> 01:13:03.150]  And to have more whistleblowers exposing what's happening.
[01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:04.511]  Now, I've wanted to get him on for a while.
[01:13:04.511 --> 01:13:06.793]  We're finally able to get Bill Bonner on.
[01:13:08.126 --> 01:13:11.427]  And he's a two-time New York Times best-selling author.
[01:13:11.427 --> 01:13:16.427]  His new book is Hormageddon, How Too Much of a Good Thing Leads to Disaster.
[01:13:16.427 --> 01:13:19.448]  The book isn't out for a few months, but I've had a chance to read some of the chapters.
[01:13:19.448 --> 01:13:21.108]  It's pretty powerful.
[01:13:21.108 --> 01:13:24.389]  He's a top entrepreneur, historian, economist.
[01:13:24.389 --> 01:13:26.989]  You see him as an analyst on a lot of big TV shows.
[01:13:26.989 --> 01:13:29.730]  He built a private business worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:32.210]  He owns businesses across the globe and travels extensively.
[01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:33.811]  But he's still a regular guy.
[01:13:33.811 --> 01:13:34.831]  He drives a Ford F-150.
[01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:35.091]  So do I.
[01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:47.719]  He has built three architecturally innovative houses with his own hands, and he has renovated many ancient buildings in Europe and has named one of the continent's honorary ambassadors.
[01:13:47.719 --> 01:13:54.964]  He could have retired years ago, but Bill is more interested in ideas and living a powerful legacy.
[01:13:54.964 --> 01:14:00.448]  So he's a Renaissance man and he joins us here today to talk about the book.
[01:14:00.448 --> 01:14:03.811]  Bill, you just heard me intro this hour because some stations join us.
[01:14:03.811 --> 01:14:05.152]  I was mentioning some of the news.
[01:14:07.185 --> 01:14:08.867]  I want to get into some of those topics with you.
[01:14:08.867 --> 01:14:17.414]  The open borders, the lawlessness, the executive, unitary executive now, even members of Congress calling Obama a dictator.
[01:14:17.414 --> 01:14:23.580]  Not a dictator for life, but setting the precedent where he just does whatever he wants.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:26.382]  And now we have police saying they can do whatever they want.
[01:14:26.382 --> 01:14:30.366]  There's so much opportunity, though, at the same time there's so much bad.
[01:14:30.366 --> 01:14:32.247]  Bill, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:14:32.247 --> 01:14:32.688]  Well, thanks.
[01:14:32.688 --> 01:14:33.949]  It's a pleasure to be with you today.
[01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:35.090]  You bet.
[01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:36.572]  Well, wow, there's so much to discuss.
[01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:37.813]  Where do you want to start?
[01:14:37.813 --> 01:14:40.817]  With the book or with current events?
[01:14:40.817 --> 01:14:45.202]  Why don't we start with current events and then we'll wrap around back to the book.
[01:14:45.202 --> 01:14:46.062]  Let's do that, Bill.
[01:14:46.062 --> 01:14:49.126]  Where do you want to start?
[01:14:49.126 --> 01:14:49.967]  There's so much to cover.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.244]  Well, you know, I'm really an economist, and that's what I've focused on.
[01:14:55.244 --> 01:15:00.949]  I don't really spend too much time on politics or other events.
[01:15:00.949 --> 01:15:04.132]  So the only thing that I really can talk about is economics.
[01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:08.036]  Economics are endlessly fascinating, endlessly funny.
[01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:12.139]  You know, when you realize what is actually going on, you get a big chuckle out of it.
[01:15:12.139 --> 01:15:14.241]  But you realize also that we're all doomed.
[01:15:14.241 --> 01:15:15.903]  I mean, you can't run an economy
[01:15:16.523 --> 01:15:23.785]  You can't run a modern economy, the biggest economy in the world, 17 trillion dollars, on what is essentially phony money.
[01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:32.207]  You know, we are running an economy, and we have been for the last 50 years almost, 40 years, and on money that is not real money.
[01:15:32.207 --> 01:15:42.710]  And I say that to people and they think I'm kind of crazy or kind of backward or, you know, some relic from the past, but really this is, what has happened is so subtle and so clever and so curious
[01:15:43.314 --> 01:15:46.377]  That you try to explain to people and they just go blank.
[01:15:46.377 --> 01:15:47.879]  They just don't understand it.
[01:15:47.879 --> 01:15:50.202]  You say, well look at that dollar in your pocket.
[01:15:50.202 --> 01:15:51.763]  What is that thing?
[01:15:51.763 --> 01:15:53.585]  It's just a piece of paper.
[01:15:53.585 --> 01:16:01.154]  And it's a piece of paper backed by the biggest military, biggest commercial and industrial power in history, but it's still just a piece of paper.
[01:16:01.714 --> 01:16:08.597]  And when push comes to shove, it will turn into the same value as every other unbacked currency in history.
[01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:10.137]  I mean, that's guaranteed.
[01:16:10.137 --> 01:16:16.500]  And you can see, just check, watch what's going on in the financial news and the economic news, and you can see it happening.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:21.402]  You know, in the last, since, you know, this has all happened in the last 50 years or so.
[01:16:21.402 --> 01:16:23.322]  In 1968, the U.S.
[01:16:23.322 --> 01:16:30.465]  government, spending too much money, spending it on the war in Vietnam and also on the Great Society programs,
[01:16:31.085 --> 01:16:32.205]  It ran out of gold.
[01:16:32.205 --> 01:16:37.207]  It didn't run out of gold because it had plenty, but it was sending money overseas to pay its bills.
[01:16:37.207 --> 01:16:42.289]  Americans were buying things overseas, and those foreigners were accumulating dollars.
[01:16:42.289 --> 01:16:48.371]  And they could come back to Washington to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and say, look, I got all these dollars.
[01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.812]  I want that gold that you promised me.
[01:16:50.812 --> 01:16:52.552]  Well, that just wasn't going to work.
[01:16:52.552 --> 01:16:56.254]  And so for a long time, a period of about four years, the U.S.
[01:16:56.254 --> 01:16:57.354]  government would just kind of
[01:16:58.112 --> 01:16:58.292]  Sure.
[01:17:24.008 --> 01:17:27.871]  You had to go out and you had to earn money, then you saved it, and then you lent it to somebody.
[01:17:27.871 --> 01:17:30.853]  And that lending was the credit market.
[01:17:30.853 --> 01:17:31.654]  And once that
[01:17:32.521 --> 01:17:34.862]  Money, the money itself was changed.
[01:17:34.862 --> 01:17:36.783]  You had an unlimited amount of credit.
[01:17:36.783 --> 01:17:42.865]  Let's quantify that, because I know you're a top economist, a best-selling author, and you've been worrying about this for decades, and now it's coming to a head.
[01:17:42.865 --> 01:17:44.946]  Ron Paul has been doing the same thing.
[01:17:44.946 --> 01:17:52.810]  When you talk about, well, I'll only cover economics, at the end of the day, economics for our world really is everything, and the metrics, and how it operates.
[01:17:52.810 --> 01:18:00.513]  So it is the most important science in understanding how humans operate, how we interact, how economies of scales, you know, from the
[01:18:01.033 --> 01:18:03.635]  Low level to the highest level intersects.
[01:18:03.635 --> 01:18:06.516]  So this is the big enchilada, as you and others have said.
[01:18:06.516 --> 01:18:11.879]  But now we're getting close to that big event that you and Ron Paul and others have discussed.
[01:18:11.879 --> 01:18:13.380]  So you're talking about the Federal Reserve.
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:18.103]  You're talking about money used to be at least based on people that worked and earned it.
[01:18:18.103 --> 01:18:20.104]  Then they would loan it to you.
[01:18:20.104 --> 01:18:21.345]  That's what gave it value.
[01:18:21.345 --> 01:18:22.386]  They had earned it.
[01:18:22.386 --> 01:18:24.327]  Now it comes out of fiat.
[01:18:24.327 --> 01:18:27.669]  And now you're writing in your book, and I agree with you, that
[01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:30.290]  We're coming up to the edge of this.
[01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:41.197]  Continue breaking down the science of it, but then give us your take on, I mean, how close we're getting and what this collapse of the dollar system might look like.
[01:18:41.197 --> 01:18:46.620]  Well, I think, let's just stick with that point for a minute, because the whole of the U.S.
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:56.906]  government financing is the financing of all these social programs, the financing of the military, the financing of everything else, and all of our personal lives, too.
[01:18:57.677 --> 01:19:02.520]  Rest upon an expansion of credit which the world has never seen before.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:08.603]  From 1968 until 2012, the amount of credit expanded 50 times.
[01:19:08.603 --> 01:19:11.524]  It went from 1 trillion to 50 trillion.
[01:19:11.524 --> 01:19:16.987]  And nothing like that has ever happened before, and it could only happen because they changed the money system.
[01:19:16.987 --> 01:19:20.369]  Before that, you couldn't expand the money supply because the money supply was gold.
[01:19:21.087 --> 01:19:26.154]  And because the money supply was gold, you couldn't lend out very much money because you didn't have any to lend out.
[01:19:26.154 --> 01:19:31.320]  So the system was self-correcting and self-controlled until that time.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.808]  So something has happened that never happened before in the history of the world, and now our whole economy.
[01:19:37.348 --> 01:19:38.729]  This is the important part.
[01:19:38.729 --> 01:19:46.414]  Our whole economy and our whole lives, all of your listeners' lives depend upon something that can't continue.
[01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:47.515]  Obviously it can't continue.
[01:19:47.515 --> 01:19:49.496]  You can't have credit going to the sky.
[01:19:49.496 --> 01:19:50.797]  It doesn't work that way.
[01:19:50.797 --> 01:19:52.838]  Eventually things go up and then they go down.
[01:19:52.838 --> 01:20:02.325]  But listen, here's what's going to happen, because someday, and I'm not going to make a guess about when, because I think it's very hard to know, these things, like everything else in the world of finance and economics,
[01:20:02.785 --> 01:20:09.228]  Things tend to go on a lot longer than you expect, and then when they happen, they tend to be a lot worse than you expect.
[01:20:09.228 --> 01:20:20.893]  Well, when this happens, what's going to happen is all of a sudden people are going to look at those dollars in their pocket, the Chinese are going to look at those dollars that they've got in their accounts, and everybody's going to say, well what is this really worth?
[01:20:20.893 --> 01:20:22.474]  What can I do with this?
[01:20:22.474 --> 01:20:22.934]  Because the U.S.
[01:20:22.934 --> 01:20:30.417]  government is printing these things like crazy to put this deal... And you said 10 years ago that would happen, they're now saying that, so aren't we starting to see the creep towards the exit?
[01:20:30.953 --> 01:20:32.474]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:20:32.474 --> 01:20:40.057]  We see it almost every day in the news where China is making deals with Russia, for example, and they're not using dollars.
[01:20:40.057 --> 01:20:51.182]  This was the big achievement of the Johnson administration, was to make sure, after Bretton Woods, that people used dollars for their oil purchases.
[01:20:51.182 --> 01:20:57.445]  Oil is the biggest commodity traded in the world, and as long as you have to use dollars to make those trades, you need dollars.
[01:20:57.965 --> 01:20:59.727]  And as long as you need dollars, the U.S.
[01:20:59.727 --> 01:21:02.570]  prints dollars, and it can use those dollars to buy things.
[01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:05.032]  That's the way the whole empire is financed.
[01:21:05.032 --> 01:21:11.719]  The whole government, everything that we take for granted today is financed on this system, which is a crazy system.
[01:21:11.719 --> 01:21:12.920]  Finally, it just cannot work.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:25.108]  And if someday, like the Chinese, everybody who's thinking about it, and that's about five people worldwide, everybody who's thinking about it, they're thinking, gee, this can't go on.
[01:21:25.108 --> 01:21:27.729]  So they are, as you say, they're starting to edge to the exit.
[01:21:27.729 --> 01:21:28.870]  And you can see the Chinese.
[01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:32.072]  The Chinese are very smart and they've got a lot of dollars.
[01:21:32.072 --> 01:21:35.875]  And they also have an economy which is pretty soon going to be bigger than the U.S.
[01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:39.317]  And pretty soon they're going to say, no, we're not going to do business in dollars.
[01:21:39.317 --> 01:21:40.878]  We're going to do business in renminbi.
[01:21:41.698 --> 01:21:42.979]  And then what are we going to say?
[01:21:42.979 --> 01:21:44.800]  We're going to say, no, you've got to do this in dollars.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.700]  No, no, no, that's not going to work.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:50.642]  So pretty soon the demand for dollars worldwide is going to go down.
[01:21:50.642 --> 01:21:51.783]  And not soon, by the way.
[01:21:51.783 --> 01:21:53.644]  I don't think this is going to happen tomorrow.
[01:21:53.644 --> 01:21:58.206]  I think it's going to happen sometime in the future, maybe sometime over the next five years, maybe over the next ten years.
[01:21:58.206 --> 01:21:58.506]  I don't know.
[01:21:59.136 --> 01:22:02.819]  But when that happens, all of a sudden, prices in the U.S.
[01:22:02.819 --> 01:22:04.021]  are starting to go up.
[01:22:04.021 --> 01:22:05.442]  It's going to be harder for the U.S.
[01:22:05.442 --> 01:22:06.182]  to borrow money.
[01:22:06.182 --> 01:22:10.967]  It's going to be harder to sell those bonds, harder for corporations to finance themselves.
[01:22:10.967 --> 01:22:16.071]  Prices of assets in the U.S., like stocks, like real estate, are starting to go down.
[01:22:16.071 --> 01:22:17.593]  Meanwhile, the costs are going up.
[01:22:18.268 --> 01:22:21.030]  And people are going to look at those dollars and say, gee, what is this?
[01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:23.072]  I think I'd rather have something else.
[01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:29.516]  And they might be, if they're a sophisticated international trader, they'll trade for renminbi or they'll trade for euros or who knows what.
[01:22:29.516 --> 01:22:31.898]  You know, they'll buy gold if they're smart.
[01:22:31.898 --> 01:22:34.140]  But if they're not, they're like everyday people.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.321]  They don't have much choice.
[01:22:35.321 --> 01:22:36.782]  They get paid in dollars.
[01:22:36.782 --> 01:22:38.183]  They spend their money in dollars.
[01:22:38.183 --> 01:22:46.949]  And what is happening is the dollars they receive, or what will happen, the dollars they receive will be worth less in terms of what they can buy with them and their living standards will go down.
[01:22:46.949 --> 01:22:47.790]  And there will be a panic.
[01:22:48.579 --> 01:23:09.154]  And when this happens, I mean, this is the interesting part, I think, really, for you and your audience, is that, you know, there are, this is what my book is about, by the way, this hormageddon is a phenomenon in nature, and it's a phenomenon that happens in mass groups and societies, where there are a lot of people, a lot of thinking going on, and a lot of groups and so on.
[01:23:09.154 --> 01:23:14.118]  But it happens, and the term, by the way, hormesis, comes from biochemistry.
[01:23:14.833 --> 01:23:24.636]  Where a biochemist found that you gave a little dose of something to a patient or an organism, and it really was good.
[01:23:24.636 --> 01:23:27.818]  And you gave it more, and the thing died.
[01:23:27.818 --> 01:23:31.579]  And this is a process by which a little bit of something is good.
[01:23:31.579 --> 01:23:34.980]  And I see how that applies to almost everything.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:35.560]  We know that.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:42.143]  That was what Jefferson meant when he said, you know, the government that governs best governs least.
[01:23:42.143 --> 01:23:42.943]  What he's saying is
[01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:49.116]  As the economist would say, the declining marginal utility of government is very high.
[01:23:49.116 --> 01:23:50.858]  I mean, it's very sharp.
[01:23:50.858 --> 01:23:52.079]  It falls off immediately.
[01:23:52.079 --> 01:23:58.807]  A little bit of government, you know, give me the rules, stick to the rules, keep it simple, keep it cheap, that's good government.
[01:23:58.807 --> 01:24:00.730]  As soon as you start passing Obamacare,
[01:24:01.633 --> 01:24:08.604]  As soon as you have the 60,000 pages of the IRS code, you don't have little government anymore.
[01:24:08.604 --> 01:24:16.317]  You've got big, expensive government and you have declining marginal utility of government, which is to say a little bit was good but a lot is terrible.
[01:24:16.732 --> 01:24:18.813]  Well, let me just throw this in.
[01:24:18.813 --> 01:24:20.515]  Again, Bill Bonner is our guest.
[01:24:20.515 --> 01:24:22.776]  Bonnerandpartners.com.
[01:24:22.776 --> 01:24:25.778]  Get Bill's book, The Number One, .com.
[01:24:25.778 --> 01:24:32.563]  If you want to find out more information, getbillsbook1.com or bonnerandpartners.com.
[01:24:32.563 --> 01:24:34.464]  You're tuning into the Alex Jones Show right now.
[01:24:34.464 --> 01:24:44.210]  That information was so important, I even skipped that network break earlier because we've got to get focused on this, as Ron Paul has said, and I know I've read your writings, Bill.
[01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:46.372]  I read your newsletter, one of your newsletters.
[01:24:47.373 --> 01:25:06.893]  Is that we're going to end up getting blamed as free market people and capitalism is going to be blamed at the end of this crony capitalist fraud when it collapses if we don't explain this isn't free market that we've seen this has been smoke and mirrors and we're coming to the end of the cycle and sure it's a safe bet to say
[01:25:07.854 --> 01:25:09.195]  Five years, ten years.
[01:25:09.195 --> 01:25:15.341]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury and Policy, the father of Reaganomics, has said the same thing here.
[01:25:15.341 --> 01:25:21.927]  But he's even accelerated it and said, no, it could be a year or two now or even next month because of the pressing.
[01:25:21.927 --> 01:25:27.892]  It's almost like our government wants to force folks out of the dollar by overthrowing Ukraine.
[01:25:28.945 --> 01:25:30.185]  Moving forces in.
[01:25:30.185 --> 01:25:33.206]  I'm not saying Russia's good either, just these are provocative moves.
[01:25:33.206 --> 01:25:34.866]  Russia's now working with China.
[01:25:34.866 --> 01:25:36.367]  They didn't trust each other before.
[01:25:36.367 --> 01:25:37.607]  Working with Iran.
[01:25:37.607 --> 01:25:40.127]  Working with BRICS.
[01:25:40.127 --> 01:25:52.550]  By accelerating the decline of the dollar, by accelerating economic moves, the QE Unlimited, the rest of it, and I want you as an economist to speak to this or disagree if you disagree, it's forcing the world, who aren't really innovators,
[01:25:53.622 --> 01:26:05.070]  I mean, a lot of these countries, to innovate away and losing the soft power of a global dollar world reserve currency and the petrodollar, it's forcing a move.
[01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:14.677]  And is there a double game at the Davos level, where they're coming out with their SDRs and other systems and their Bitcoins of the future?
[01:26:14.677 --> 01:26:17.779]  I believe Bitcoin will be the proto of a system they're going to bring out.
[01:26:18.677 --> 01:26:29.982]  Because I've watched them in the past, and that they're actually preparing a global dollar crisis that they're going to profit from controlling, and that they will actually come out with the new system in the next two to five years.
[01:26:29.982 --> 01:26:35.424]  That's what my gut approximation is from deep study.
[01:26:35.424 --> 01:26:40.326]  If I had to go with my gut, because at a certain point, I'm not in the highest councils of these people.
[01:26:40.326 --> 01:26:43.808]  I know you run with a lot of big economists and people.
[01:26:43.808 --> 01:26:45.689]  I mean, how are you investing?
[01:26:45.689 --> 01:26:46.609]  What are you doing?
[01:26:48.989 --> 01:26:50.770]  I mean, that's a lot of stuff I threw out there.
[01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:58.193]  Yeah, well Alex, you know, let me just continue this thought about what happened.
[01:26:58.193 --> 01:27:01.354]  Yeah, let's talk about what's going to happen for me.
[01:27:01.354 --> 01:27:13.619]  And then we'll come back to it, but I think it's important to understand that this phenomenon that we're discussing, a phenomenon where you get a little bit of something and it's good, you get a lot of something, and it's not just bad, it's disastrous.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.201]  Disasters.
[01:27:15.201 --> 01:27:27.579]  I use the example of Germany after World War II where Germany, they felt, and rightly so, they felt they had been stabbed in the back in World War I and the Versailles Treaty and everything.
[01:27:28.297 --> 01:27:33.539]  And what they wanted more than anything else after World War I was security.
[01:27:33.539 --> 01:27:41.982]  They felt that they didn't have any security, they'd been badly treated, everything was bad, and they needed security.
[01:27:41.982 --> 01:27:51.625]  And so, along came this guy who'd been, you know, like a sergeant in the army during World War I, and he said, I'll give you security, you know, Germany's got to take its proper place in the world, etc., etc.
[01:27:51.625 --> 01:27:56.487]  And he had all kinds of nutty ideas, but he was essentially an economist.
[01:27:57.279 --> 01:28:00.481]  And he was essentially a world-improving economist.
[01:28:00.481 --> 01:28:03.162]  He was a meddler, an interventionist, an activist.
[01:28:03.162 --> 01:28:06.663]  And his idea, he was Germany first.
[01:28:06.663 --> 01:28:13.266]  It had to have security so it had to spend more money, more of its own money, to build up its military forces.
[01:28:13.266 --> 01:28:14.467]  And it did that.
[01:28:14.467 --> 01:28:19.889]  And this... Well, you're right.
[01:28:19.889 --> 01:28:23.191]  And is there any way to reverse this?
[01:28:23.191 --> 01:28:25.252]  Or to have a soft landing?
[01:28:31.915 --> 01:28:32.976]  We lost Bill.
[01:28:32.976 --> 01:28:38.521]  I thought that sounded like we'd lost him because it just suddenly faded out and he was gone.
[01:28:38.521 --> 01:28:39.923]  That happens occasionally.
[01:28:39.923 --> 01:28:56.078]  If you're a TV viewer, we've been putting on screen different shots of Weimar, Germany, and when you came in to eat dinner for an hour, you'd want to pay up front because
[01:28:57.554 --> 01:29:00.195]  The meal might double or triple in price by the end.
[01:29:00.195 --> 01:29:09.519]  That just happened in Zimbabwe, in Africa in the last five years, where, you know, basically a hamburger would be a trillion of their dollars.
[01:29:09.519 --> 01:29:12.920]  They would have whole carts of money just trying to buy things.
[01:29:14.238 --> 01:29:15.819]  Okay, we're going to break here in a moment.
[01:29:15.819 --> 01:29:17.020]  We did get Bill back.
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:22.205]  We're going to come back to him and let him finish his point and continue on how we try to turn this around.
[01:29:22.205 --> 01:29:23.606]  Is there a way to have a soft landing?
[01:29:23.606 --> 01:29:25.387]  Is there a way to turn it around?
[01:29:25.387 --> 01:29:27.029]  He's a great economist, great writer.
[01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:29.050]  He's written two New York Times bestsellers.
[01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:30.191]  Hormageddon is coming out.
[01:29:30.191 --> 01:29:35.336]  We're going to ask him why it has that name and can we avoid Zimbabwe level or Weimar level
[01:29:36.176 --> 01:29:37.757]  Uh, inflation in this country.
[01:29:37.757 --> 01:29:42.218]  You're already seeing a lot of food prices, record prices, a lot of other things are ticking up.
[01:29:42.218 --> 01:29:44.639]  But inflation will hit us last year.
[01:29:44.639 --> 01:29:48.721]  The dollar already, I've been overseas, is really turning into toilet paper.
[01:29:48.721 --> 01:29:50.282]  And it's a sad thing.
[01:29:50.282 --> 01:29:51.742]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[01:29:51.742 --> 01:29:53.143]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.143 --> 01:29:54.883]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.883 --> 01:29:56.324]  By the way, his website's getbillsbook1.com.
[01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:58.885]  Getbillsbook1.com or barandpartners.com.
[01:30:02.628 --> 01:30:03.909]  I mean, I taste dirt in it.
[01:30:03.909 --> 01:30:05.231]  God knows what's in this.
[01:30:05.231 --> 01:30:09.515]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:30:09.515 --> 01:30:15.541]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:16.623]  That one is better.
[01:30:16.623 --> 01:30:17.864]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:30:17.864 --> 01:30:19.345]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[01:30:19.345 --> 01:30:19.826]  It's good water.
[01:30:19.946 --> 01:30:26.009]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:30:26.009 --> 01:30:33.352]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[01:30:33.352 --> 01:30:36.054]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[01:30:36.054 --> 01:30:44.137]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:30:44.137 --> 01:30:45.578]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:30:45.578 --> 01:30:46.498]  It's good water.
[01:30:46.498 --> 01:30:46.959]  Refreshing.
[01:30:46.959 --> 01:30:47.439]  It's good!

[01:31:37.007 --> 01:31:39.148]  This is not a low-grade formula.

[01:31:58.378 --> 01:32:08.583]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forward situation?
[01:32:08.583 --> 01:32:11.885]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:32:11.885 --> 01:32:13.686]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[01:32:13.686 --> 01:32:20.049]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:32:20.049 --> 01:32:25.932]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:32:26.072 --> 01:32:30.035]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:32:30.035 --> 01:32:33.118]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:32:33.118 --> 01:32:41.404]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:32:41.404 --> 01:32:43.486]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:32:43.486 --> 01:32:44.547]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:32:44.907 --> 01:32:53.835]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:33:04.764 --> 01:33:12.491]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:15.331 --> 01:33:15.634]  I'm good.
[01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:55.093]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:33:55.093 --> 01:33:57.335]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:57.335 --> 01:34:05.504]  And we are at the halfway point in this Thursday, Worldwide, 7th day of August, 2014 transmission.
[01:34:05.504 --> 01:34:07.927]  Now, America won World War II.
[01:34:09.212 --> 01:34:14.313]  We were the good guys, by every yardstick, and we became the world reserve currency.
[01:34:14.313 --> 01:34:20.115]  They had the Bretton Woods Agreement, where the dollar became the currency of the planet.
[01:34:20.115 --> 01:34:22.816]  And slowly that began to get abused.
[01:34:22.816 --> 01:34:27.997]  And economists warned of it across the board, and said we'll end up like Weimar Germany down the road.
[01:34:29.642 --> 01:34:31.203]  Mexico's done similar things.
[01:34:31.203 --> 01:34:32.424]  Argentina.
[01:34:32.424 --> 01:34:37.168]  Every country has done this basically at one time in their history, one way or another.
[01:34:37.168 --> 01:34:43.013]  And it always ends, sometimes a generation or two later, in disaster.
[01:34:43.013 --> 01:34:51.360]  And that's what economist Bill Bonner, bonnerandpartners.com, his new book, Hormageddon, is breaking down.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.301]  And I want to get in
[01:34:53.683 --> 01:34:59.689]  To the book, I want to talk about the fact that you can go to GetBillsBook1.com.
[01:34:59.689 --> 01:35:04.735]  He wanted to just come on and talk about the economy, but I've got the breakdown from the website on it.
[01:35:04.735 --> 01:35:09.259]  You can go there and get a hardback edition of the book before it's available anywhere.
[01:35:09.259 --> 01:35:10.561]  You can get an electronic copy.
[01:35:10.561 --> 01:35:16.067]  You can get a great compendium of America called The Idea of America, a four years
[01:35:16.747 --> 01:35:22.129]  I'm in a full year of Bill's new publication called The Bonner Letter.
[01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:28.292]  And number five, you get a special number one report, Bill Bonner's Trade of the Decade.
[01:35:28.292 --> 01:35:34.135]  And number six, you can get special report number two, The Bonner Family Wealth Blueprint.
[01:35:34.135 --> 01:35:37.916]  And he didn't come on to do this today, but I read his stuff, so I'm plugging it for him.
[01:35:37.916 --> 01:35:41.738]  When you go to his website, get Bill's book,
[01:35:42.358 --> 01:36:06.100]  the number one dot com you can sign up and get all of that for forty nine dollars you'll receive that and i'm telling you just one of the newsletters for a year it's a value of forty nine dollars you get six different things all there on the website you can sign up for that it get bills book the number one dot com or bonner and partners dot com you can also navigate
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:23.239]  Over there as well, so he joins us here today to go over all this so build Again, I want to give you the floor to really encapsulate all this for people, but but but take your time at the same time I mean if you take 20 minutes, it's encapsulating it.
[01:36:23.239 --> 01:36:25.742]  So we're you're telling the story of Weimar Germany.
[01:36:25.742 --> 01:36:26.803]  I think we should go back to that
[01:36:27.921 --> 01:36:38.615]  And then, I was asking you the question, selfishly and for my audience, I know it's very technical, that's why it's in the book and in the newsletters, but just to gestalt, how have you protected yourself?
[01:36:38.615 --> 01:36:40.557]  What do you really think the time frame is?
[01:36:40.557 --> 01:36:41.739]  I know no man knows, you know.
[01:36:42.995 --> 01:36:45.977]  All this stuff, because only God knows that stuff.
[01:36:45.977 --> 01:36:47.498]  Even the globalists with their control.
[01:36:47.498 --> 01:36:47.918]  No, no.
[01:36:47.918 --> 01:36:51.140]  It might be a year out, might be five, might be ten.
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:51.600]  You don't know.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:54.081]  These things tend to last longer than you expect.
[01:36:54.081 --> 01:36:59.564]  But I think anybody, anybody would be foolish not to be protected now, because you never know.
[01:36:59.564 --> 01:37:02.806]  This thing could, you know, we're seeing some sell-off in the market now.
[01:37:02.806 --> 01:37:04.247]  We're seeing a lot of skittishness.
[01:37:04.247 --> 01:37:06.648]  We're seeing, you know, those Russian troops at the border.
[01:37:06.648 --> 01:37:07.329]  Who knows?
[01:37:07.329 --> 01:37:08.249]  You never know.
[01:37:08.249 --> 01:37:09.370]  So you've got to be prepared.
[01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:22.776]  And the preparation this time, I think, should be better than ever, because, you know, the last time we've had a serious, serious problem in the country, in the United States of America, was during the 30s.
[01:37:22.776 --> 01:37:25.137]  And the 30s was the Great Depression, of course, everybody knows.
[01:37:25.137 --> 01:37:32.861]  But during the 30s, people could still get by, because a quarter of the country still lived on the farm.
[01:37:32.861 --> 01:37:36.523]  And those people who didn't live on the farm hadn't been off the farm for very long.
[01:37:37.063 --> 01:37:48.692]  And the society did not depend on being able to go up to an ATM machine, put in a plastic card, and get something come out of that machine that was worth something that you could buy something with.
[01:37:48.692 --> 01:37:58.099]  Now all that stuff, you know, this is something I don't think anybody really understands, but the more complex, the more sophisticated the society becomes,
[01:37:58.659 --> 01:38:04.604]  The less it can afford to have this kind of central planning meddling in the economy.
[01:38:04.604 --> 01:38:06.145]  The easier the breakdown.
[01:38:06.145 --> 01:38:07.106]  The easier the breakdown.
[01:38:07.106 --> 01:38:08.327]  They're going to screw it up.
[01:38:08.327 --> 01:38:09.208]  They're going to screw it up.
[01:38:09.208 --> 01:38:16.554]  And we're seeing this major, major mess that they've made, which yet has not been revealed that most people don't even know what's going on.
[01:38:16.554 --> 01:38:20.197]  But they've driven up the amount of credit in society to $50 trillion.
[01:38:21.358 --> 01:38:36.010]  And if credit had remained as the same percentage of GDP as it had been for the last, like, 50 years, you know, today we have about $33 trillion worth of credit.
[01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:41.714]  And so that $33 trillion, that's the money that people have spent over the last 40 years.
[01:38:41.714 --> 01:38:43.675]  And mostly over the last 10 or 20 years.
[01:38:43.675 --> 01:38:46.258]  Well, how does the increased credit... Sure, sure.
[01:38:46.258 --> 01:38:48.759]  How does the increased credit, and I want you to continue,
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:39:00.513]  End up wrecking society because before they did all this fake credit, this country had 10% growth rates for the first 140 years or so of its existence.
[01:39:00.513 --> 01:39:03.817]  And then once all the Federal Reserve meddling got involved in 1913, they took regional
[01:39:09.528 --> 01:39:15.394]  Oh, that's exactly right.
[01:39:15.394 --> 01:39:17.856]  Before, companies would go broke.
[01:39:17.856 --> 01:39:19.617]  The whole banks would go belly up.
[01:39:19.617 --> 01:39:23.100]  Things would happen, and they would have crises in the economy.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:29.926]  And in 1921, for example, there was a crisis, and stocks fell, and they fell down about 30%.
[01:39:29.926 --> 01:39:30.927]  And there was a depression.
[01:39:30.927 --> 01:39:33.289]  1 out of 10 people was thrown out of work in 1920.
[01:39:34.450 --> 01:39:37.452]  But that expression was over in 18 months.
[01:39:37.452 --> 01:39:39.153]  18 months later, there was full employment.
[01:39:39.153 --> 01:39:40.293]  How did that happen?
[01:39:40.293 --> 01:39:48.978]  Well, it happened because the meddlers were not in office, and they weren't meddling with the economy and preventing the process of healing.
[01:39:48.978 --> 01:39:57.542]  In order for an economy to heal, things have to fall down to the level where people want to buy them, and they buy them, and then they start investing again, and the thing gets going again.
[01:39:57.922 --> 01:39:59.383]  I mean, that's no mystery.
[01:39:59.383 --> 01:40:01.444]  That's been going on for a long time.
[01:40:01.444 --> 01:40:04.525]  But now we have a system where it's entirely different.
[01:40:04.525 --> 01:40:14.629]  And that system, by the way, had to work that way because they did not have an unlimited amount of money to save industries, to save investments, to save people.
[01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:15.110]  They couldn't.
[01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:20.452]  There was no Fannie Mae back then, and they didn't have the money to save it if it got into trouble.
[01:40:20.452 --> 01:40:22.093]  Bill, Bill, Bill, I want you to continue.
[01:40:22.093 --> 01:40:24.694]  This is so important, but just me personally.
[01:40:25.887 --> 01:40:32.031]  I mean, and my family and everybody else that I know that's somewhat successful or understands economics are totally freaked out.
[01:40:32.031 --> 01:40:38.055]  Governments are digging in, buying armored vehicles and weapons, and the Pentagon admits they believe we're going to have a collapse down the road.
[01:40:38.055 --> 01:40:47.561]  So what you're saying in the thinking public is prima facie, known to be true, and you and others predicted it before it was, you know, popularly known.
[01:40:47.561 --> 01:40:50.904]  What I'm asking you is, it's so scary when you talk about
[01:40:52.084 --> 01:41:04.111]  90% of people were somewhat self-sufficient and rural in the 10-year Great Depression, and we had millions of people homeless and millions that starved and deaths and all the rest of it.
[01:41:04.111 --> 01:41:05.252]  It was a disaster.
[01:41:05.252 --> 01:41:08.673]  Now we have 90% urban, 10% rural.
[01:41:08.673 --> 01:41:13.016]  Half the rural people, it's estimated, even by the Department of Defense, are self-sufficient.
[01:41:13.476 --> 01:41:23.479]  My God, if we have a breakdown now of a complex system like this with meddlers, it could turn into a road warrior meets the road meets Armageddon.
[01:41:23.479 --> 01:41:25.520]  Is that what Hormageddon is?
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.921]  That's what it's about.
[01:41:26.921 --> 01:41:31.142]  It describes what happens when things really go bad, and they really go bad.
[01:41:31.943 --> 01:41:36.787]  In a collective way when the central planners come get to work and pick at it.
[01:41:36.787 --> 01:41:38.849]  And that was what I was telling you about the German example.
[01:41:38.849 --> 01:41:44.653]  That was really what was going on was Adolf Hitler was an economist who had a plan for Germany's future.
[01:41:44.653 --> 01:41:48.436]  How to make it better and he stuck with that plan until the country was absolutely
[01:41:48.736 --> 01:41:49.796]  Absolutely destroyed.
[01:41:49.796 --> 01:41:53.937]  There was hardly a factory working in Germany in 1945.
[01:41:53.937 --> 01:42:03.519]  The whole country was flattened, it was invaded, half occupied by the Allies, half occupied by the Russians, and it was an absolute total disaster, catastrophe.
[01:42:03.519 --> 01:42:13.460]  The same thing had happened with the previous invasion of Russia led by Napoleon, in which he went in with 300,000 troops and came back with 10,000 troops.
[01:42:16.861 --> 01:42:27.105]  I mean, these are disasters on a massive scale, and what we're looking at now is the same caliber of disaster in finance and economics.
[01:42:27.105 --> 01:42:41.310]  Something that has never happened before in the history of the world, and is happening now because the leaders of the biggest economy, the most influential monetary power on the planet, have been doing something for the last 50 years, which is fundamentally very, very stupid.
[01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:51.654]  And we're going to, we and our children, are going to reap the results of that, which is going to be one of these Armageddon-type catastrophes, where everything goes wrong.
[01:42:51.654 --> 01:42:52.155]  Everything.
[01:42:52.155 --> 01:42:55.656]  You go to the ATM machine, it won't work, there won't be enough cash.
[01:42:55.656 --> 01:43:01.159]  You know, what happens in hyperinflation is the printing presses can't run fast enough.
[01:43:01.159 --> 01:43:03.360]  You can't get enough cash to make it work.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:10.203]  And I'm indebted to Gary North, who pointed out a lot of this stuff back in the year 2000, when he was talking about the Y2K disaster.
[01:43:10.203 --> 01:43:10.863]  We didn't have a Y2K.
[01:43:11.423 --> 01:43:11.783]  I think so.
[01:43:30.994 --> 01:43:33.256]  People can't live for more than a couple days!
[01:43:33.256 --> 01:43:42.745]  You know, these systems of communication, of delivery, logistics, and all that, break down, and they all, by the way, they all run on money!
[01:43:42.745 --> 01:43:46.008]  And money, the money system breaks down, everything breaks down.
[01:43:46.008 --> 01:43:49.351]  That's exactly what happened in Germany in the Weimar Republic.
[01:43:49.351 --> 01:43:51.773]  It's what happened recently in Zimbabwe.
[01:43:51.773 --> 01:43:54.856]  But those were relatively primitive societies.
[01:43:54.856 --> 01:43:57.138]  Even Weimar Germany is very civilized, of course.
[01:43:57.378 --> 01:43:58.639]  Well, Bill, I understand that.
[01:44:23.268 --> 01:44:27.990]  Well, let's talk about what that disaster could look like and what could precipitate it.
[01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:36.594]  I mean, we already see sanctions on Russia hurting Russia, the EU, and the U.S., and the stock market going down because of it.
[01:44:36.594 --> 01:44:40.315]  I mean, it seems the meddling could actually accelerate this demise.
[01:44:40.315 --> 01:44:44.337]  A. B. Is there a way to turn this around or have a soft landing?
[01:44:44.337 --> 01:44:46.258]  Well, I'll answer B first.
[01:44:46.258 --> 01:44:46.898]  The answer is no.
[01:44:47.682 --> 01:44:50.104]  Because that's the nature of Ormageddon.
[01:44:50.104 --> 01:44:52.286]  And Ormageddon starts up, there's no stopping it.
[01:44:52.286 --> 01:44:56.709]  And there's no stopping it because it gets everybody behind it, everybody lined up.
[01:44:56.709 --> 01:45:02.714]  And now you can see, everybody who gets anything from the government is in favor of getting more from the government.
[01:45:02.714 --> 01:45:07.418]  They now control the government, there are more people who get something from the government than who pay taxes.
[01:45:07.418 --> 01:45:08.779]  That's not going to change!
[01:45:08.779 --> 01:45:10.681]  And so you're going to see more and more demand.
[01:45:10.681 --> 01:45:13.383]  And besides that, these economists running the Fed,
[01:45:13.803 --> 01:45:16.325]  They've all built their careers, their reputations.
[01:45:16.325 --> 01:45:18.707]  You know, they get these Nobel Prizes for Pete's sake.
[01:45:18.707 --> 01:45:27.295]  And they get it for an idea about controlling a society and controlling its economy, which is fundamentally false.
[01:45:27.295 --> 01:45:28.776]  And these people are not going to back up.
[01:45:28.776 --> 01:45:30.017]  They're not going to say, oh, guess what?
[01:45:30.017 --> 01:45:30.818]  I was wrong.
[01:45:30.818 --> 01:45:31.238]  No!
[01:45:31.238 --> 01:45:32.499]  They're not going to do that at all.
[01:45:32.499 --> 01:45:36.022]  Here's what I... And so now we get to the part A. Here's what's going to happen.
[01:45:36.022 --> 01:45:38.144]  And this is going to start happening pretty soon.
[01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:46.137]  Because we're running out of this, you know, they're winding down this QE program, and as they wind it down, they're going to find stocks begin to fall.
[01:45:46.137 --> 01:45:47.958]  We're already seeing that.
[01:45:47.958 --> 01:45:58.546]  And when we get some bad indicators, like a stock market falls off a thousand points, or we could come up with a bad reading of a revised figures for GDP, you know, who knows?
[01:45:58.546 --> 01:46:02.929]  Or it could be a geopolitical thing, you know, like a Russian invasion of Crimea, who knows?
[01:46:02.929 --> 01:46:03.970]  But something will happen.
[01:46:03.970 --> 01:46:05.611]  Stocks will fall.
[01:46:06.414 --> 01:46:08.735]  The economy all of a sudden will look rotten.
[01:46:08.735 --> 01:46:11.416]  And what will Janet Yellen and company do?
[01:46:11.416 --> 01:46:13.417]  They won't have any choice about it.
[01:46:13.417 --> 01:46:20.959]  All their training, all their experience, everything they believe will tell them, well, they've just got to go back and do more of what they were doing before.
[01:46:20.959 --> 01:46:32.183]  That means more money printing, probably more direct money printing, probably more direct financing of federal government expenses, and probably putting more liquidity directly into the system.
[01:46:32.183 --> 01:46:34.004]  And for a while, that could have
[01:46:34.770 --> 01:46:37.552]  Results again, once again, that look favorable.
[01:46:37.552 --> 01:46:39.674]  And we could see a big boost in the stock market.
[01:46:39.674 --> 01:46:43.137]  We could see headlines saying, well, they saved the world again.
[01:46:43.137 --> 01:46:48.801]  And then we're off to the races again with another big run-up, another big bubble blowing up.
[01:46:50.293 --> 01:46:53.555]  Fundamentally, you can't build success by printing money.
[01:46:53.555 --> 01:46:57.918]  If you could, why, Zimbabwe would be the richest country on earth.
[01:46:57.918 --> 01:47:00.580]  They printed billions of it, billions of it.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:01.361]  But you can't do it.
[01:47:01.361 --> 01:47:02.181]  It doesn't work that way.
[01:47:02.181 --> 01:47:03.762]  You've got to save money, you've got to invest it.
[01:47:03.762 --> 01:47:05.484]  It's a long, hard process.
[01:47:05.484 --> 01:47:06.084]  That's how you get
[01:47:06.943 --> 01:47:08.724]  Well look at most third world countries.
[01:47:08.724 --> 01:47:17.867]  Many of them were prosperous previously until they went through the money printing hyperinflation situation and then they never come back from it.
[01:47:17.867 --> 01:47:24.529]  That's what's so scary is that the governments actually use the crisis to get full control and then never let
[01:47:25.973 --> 01:47:41.048]  I haven't even gotten into that, but just on the money side of it, when the money starts, you know, Janet Yellen prints more money, things look good, then they start to look bad because it fundamentally doesn't work.
[01:47:41.648 --> 01:47:43.290]  And then, they print more money.
[01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:45.652]  And now pretty soon, they cannot stop this.
[01:47:45.652 --> 01:47:49.895]  And they interviewed the guy, his name was Gideon Gono, who ran the Bank of Zimbabwe.
[01:47:49.895 --> 01:47:51.356]  And they said, well, why did you do that?
[01:47:51.356 --> 01:47:52.637]  That was crazy.
[01:47:52.637 --> 01:47:56.140]  And he explained how, at every step of the way, he didn't have a choice.
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:48:06.709]  You know, he had bankers, industrialists, and the president of the country all coming in and saying, we need more money, because people are running out of it, babies are crying, and you know, who knows?
[01:48:08.021 --> 01:48:15.285]  Well, it's the same thing with the open border and giving free welfare to tens of millions of people pouring in.
[01:48:15.285 --> 01:48:16.885]  They go, it's children.
[01:48:16.885 --> 01:48:17.886]  Love them.
[01:48:17.886 --> 01:48:19.007]  There are children.
[01:48:19.007 --> 01:48:23.589]  And I go, wait a minute, they can't take care of them in Guatemala or in Zimbabwe.
[01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:27.911]  How am I supposed to take care of them when we're already on paper bankrupt?
[01:48:27.911 --> 01:48:29.632]  And they go, you just don't like children.
[01:48:29.992 --> 01:48:32.873]  And I go, okay, well, Zimbabwe will take my kids then?
[01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:47.296]  I mean, it's crazy how it's all just emotional garbage, and that's supposed to trump cold, hard, economic, 100% scientific fact, incontrovertible, and then here's the worst part, Bill, and I want your take on this.
[01:48:47.296 --> 01:48:51.297]  It's all over the news, year to year, all the top billionaires have left Israel.
[01:48:52.077 --> 01:48:53.978]  Top billionaires are leaving the U.S.
[01:48:53.978 --> 01:49:00.641]  buying armored redoubts in the Cook Islands and the middle of nowhere in Australia and New Zealand and the Caribbean.
[01:49:00.641 --> 01:49:13.946]  Governments are digging in saying they see total collapse by 2020 and martial law worldwide and war on the streets and the army's training for, you know, zombie apocalypse, using zombie cover for mowing down crowds of people.
[01:49:13.946 --> 01:49:15.967]  I mean, governments digging in.
[01:49:15.967 --> 01:49:18.348]  They admit they know this is coming.
[01:49:18.348 --> 01:49:20.669]  And I mean, I'm literally saying, what do I need to do?
[01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:26.457]  Well, I mean, what you need to do, I think, is the same thing that Gary North recommended 14 years ago.
[01:49:26.457 --> 01:49:37.102]  He said, look, when these complicated, sophisticated systems break down, you need to be in a place and you need to have the stuff that you need to survive without them.
[01:49:37.102 --> 01:49:40.323]  And his idea then, which is still a good idea, he said, look,
[01:49:40.959 --> 01:49:44.303]  You know, to save your money, buy a farm in the Ozark.
[01:49:44.303 --> 01:49:53.834]  You've got to be somewhere where you're not dependent upon the shelves of the local 7-Eleven, because there are going to be a lot of people going after those shelves.
[01:49:53.834 --> 01:49:58.520]  You've got to make sure you have some shelves of your own, and they've got to be somewhere where everybody else isn't going to get to them.
[01:49:59.327 --> 01:50:05.149]  I know that sounds apocalyptic, and some of my neighbors think that's kind of nutty and crazy, but I don't think it is at all.
[01:50:05.149 --> 01:50:06.850]  Hey, hey, hey!
[01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:07.810]  You're not nutty at all, Bill!
[01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:10.931]  When a new crisis comes, you need to have some security.
[01:50:10.931 --> 01:50:16.153]  And security means you have to have the things that the complicated systems can't provide.
[01:50:16.153 --> 01:50:20.635]  And they won't be able to provide, necessarily, food, water, or money.
[01:50:20.635 --> 01:50:21.435]  And so you need to have
[01:50:22.094 --> 01:50:24.136]  Real money, gold and silver coined.
[01:50:24.136 --> 01:50:31.262]  You need to have real food, either in form of a garden, something you produce, cows on the hoof, whatever you need, or in storage.
[01:50:31.262 --> 01:50:33.724]  And you need to have a source of water that you can depend on.
[01:50:33.724 --> 01:50:35.325]  Those are really the basics.
[01:50:35.325 --> 01:50:36.726]  Bill, stay there.
[01:50:36.726 --> 01:50:37.387]  We gotta go to break.
[01:50:37.387 --> 01:50:38.307]  Bill Bonner's our guest.
[01:50:39.248 --> 01:50:42.772]  The new book coming out, it's a mushroom cloud with a clown forming a clown.
[01:50:42.772 --> 01:50:45.576]  Formageddon, how too much of a good thing leads to disaster.
[01:50:45.576 --> 01:50:46.577]  Bill Bonner.
[01:50:46.577 --> 01:50:52.384]  But what he's saying is absolutely on target about being prepared, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:52.384 --> 01:50:54.066]  And again, government is doing it.
[01:50:54.066 --> 01:50:57.349]  If there was a 10% chance that this was going to happen, we should all be prepared.
[01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:58.330]  It's like 95.
[01:50:58.330 --> 01:51:02.032]  I mean, the only question is, how bad's it gonna be?
[01:51:02.032 --> 01:51:02.652]  When's it gonna happen?
[01:51:02.652 --> 01:51:05.633]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:05.862]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[01:52:05.862 --> 01:52:09.103]  I'm sure you know, this economy sucks!
[01:52:09.103 --> 01:52:15.006]  We all realize that the American economy is tremendously unstable right now and will likely get much worse.
[01:52:15.006 --> 01:52:23.870]  There's monumental debt, government bailouts, stock and real estate bubbles that are primed to pop at any moment which can flush away most or all of your retirement savings.
[01:52:24.150 --> 01:52:27.031]  This type of movement has enormous consequences.
[01:52:27.031 --> 01:52:32.473]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[01:52:32.473 --> 01:52:35.333]  Financial trouble is right here at our doorstep.
[01:52:35.333 --> 01:52:41.435]  But if you move right now and develop a backup plan immediately, this could be the most profitable time of your life.
[01:52:41.435 --> 01:52:46.677]  Proportionally, more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in our history.

[01:54:22.222 --> 01:54:26.664]  Sometimes we end up having themed shows, almost by accident.
[01:54:26.664 --> 01:54:28.746]  Just because I'll say, I want to get Bill Bonner on.
[01:54:28.746 --> 01:54:31.827]  I want the author of this book on.
[01:54:31.827 --> 01:54:34.249]  I read his newsletter.
[01:54:34.249 --> 01:54:40.292]  Or I'll say, the Ebola outbreak is a great example of what could happen during a crisis.
[01:54:40.292 --> 01:54:47.016]  Let's get the expert on it, who's the best-selling author of The Secure Home, Strategic Relocation, Joel Skousen.
[01:54:47.016 --> 01:54:48.536]  He's on with us in the next hour.
[01:54:48.536 --> 01:54:50.918]  We'll open the phones up for him in the second half for your questions.
[01:54:51.747 --> 01:54:53.448]  On this live Thursday edition.
[01:54:53.448 --> 01:54:56.130]  But I didn't even mean to have the two guys together today.
[01:54:56.130 --> 01:54:57.711]  That's just how the producers did it.
[01:54:57.711 --> 01:54:59.413]  And it works out perfectly.
[01:54:59.413 --> 01:55:02.635]  Because I'm not gloom and doom.
[01:55:02.635 --> 01:55:06.378]  I'm somebody that wants to be successful even in a global crisis.
[01:55:06.378 --> 01:55:08.459]  I want to stop the global crisis.
[01:55:08.459 --> 01:55:14.183]  But if I can't stop the global crisis, I'm going to be positioned to be more successful.
[01:55:14.183 --> 01:55:15.644]  And that's what Bill writes about.
[01:55:15.644 --> 01:55:19.607]  And he's got a great track record in his newsletter and his books.
[01:55:19.607 --> 01:55:20.368]  He is, hey,
[01:55:21.803 --> 01:55:24.347]  Decry the bad stuff that's happening, try to change it.
[01:55:24.347 --> 01:55:25.889]  If you can't change all of it or part of it...
[01:55:27.298 --> 01:55:29.880]  Ways to profit from it morally.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.121]  Still being moral.
[01:55:31.121 --> 01:55:33.183]  Ways to protect yourself.
[01:55:33.183 --> 01:55:36.225]  And you can get his book at getbillsbook1.com.
[01:55:36.225 --> 01:55:40.509]  And you can get a discount on it out of the gates, basically.

[01:55:43.971 --> 01:55:46.473]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:55:46.473 --> 01:55:48.955]  We're gonna go back to him for some final comments here in a moment.
[01:55:48.955 --> 01:55:53.919]  Maybe even do five more minutes into the next hour before our next guest gets on so he can finish up.
[01:55:53.919 --> 01:55:56.862]  But this hour is brought to you by Infidel Body Armor.
[01:55:57.322 --> 01:56:00.206]  Infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:56:00.206 --> 01:56:02.248]  Again, Infidel Body Armor is owned by a U.S.
[01:56:02.248 --> 01:56:04.170]  Air Force veteran outside Dallas.
[01:56:04.170 --> 01:56:05.512]  It's where they manufacture it.
[01:56:05.512 --> 01:56:07.094]  They've been promoting it for three years.
[01:56:07.094 --> 01:56:08.496]  It is a bestseller.
[01:56:08.496 --> 01:56:10.318]  Police and military are buying it.
[01:56:10.318 --> 01:56:14.863]  It's better than the chromatic ceramic type stuff, and it takes more bullets.
[01:56:15.464 --> 01:56:19.926]  Check it out, InfidelBodyArmor.com or 888-608-6605.
[01:56:19.926 --> 01:56:22.888]  They got some great videos and more there.
[01:56:22.888 --> 01:56:29.951]  All sizes, a lot of MOLLE pouches, a lot of other really great tack gear produced by combat veterans.
[01:56:29.951 --> 01:56:33.893]  So InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:56:33.893 --> 01:56:36.154]  Let's go back to our guest here, Bill Bonner.
[01:56:36.154 --> 01:56:39.996]  Bill, finishing up in the minutes we've got on points you haven't gotten to.
[01:56:39.996 --> 01:56:41.397]  Yeah.
[01:56:42.372 --> 01:56:49.558]  Well, you know, one thing I wanted to point out is that there are times to make money and there are times not to lose it.
[01:56:49.558 --> 01:56:56.643]  And when you get into a real crisis, and a real crisis is a time when the winner is the one who loses least.
[01:56:57.731 --> 01:57:08.015]  And if the crisis is the kind of crisis that I think is coming, then losing least is going to mean you're just kind of holding on to what you've got as best as you can.
[01:57:08.015 --> 01:57:12.396]  And that probably means making sure your family is safe and sound during the crisis.
[01:57:12.396 --> 01:57:17.538]  So I think the number one thing is start there and for everybody, you know, should have a
[01:57:18.118 --> 01:57:18.939]  I don't
[01:57:34.513 --> 01:57:38.037]  I don't know them, and I'm sure people make a lot of money on them.
[01:57:38.037 --> 01:57:39.178]  It's good for them.
[01:57:39.178 --> 01:57:45.503]  But as far as preserving my family's wealth and making money, I'm going to stick to things that really seem solid to me.
[01:57:45.503 --> 01:57:48.426]  And what seems solid to me right now is some real estate.
[01:57:48.426 --> 01:57:52.029]  Real estate, apartment buildings still seem pretty good, apartment deals.
[01:57:52.029 --> 01:57:55.633]  There are some stocks, mostly outside the U.S., which are still good buys.
[01:57:56.449 --> 01:57:58.270]  And that's what the elites are doing.
[01:57:58.270 --> 01:58:04.471]  They're buying farms, they're buying redoubts, they're buying real estate, they're buying gold and silver, and they're getting bodyguards, and they're buying guns.
[01:58:16.604 --> 01:58:18.746]  Yes, I think that's about right.
[01:58:18.746 --> 01:58:26.295]  And you can hope that the... I don't know if that's really a good hope, but you can think that the thing will go on a lot longer and you can take advantage of it.
[01:58:26.295 --> 01:58:27.656]  For all I know, the U.S.
[01:58:27.656 --> 01:58:30.960]  stock market could go up another 20%, maybe even 50%.
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:33.443]  Sir, I know you gotta go, but can you do five more minutes with us?
[01:58:35.011 --> 01:58:36.132]  Yeah, pardon me?
[01:58:36.132 --> 01:58:37.394]  Can you do five more minutes with us?
[01:58:37.394 --> 01:58:38.455]  Sure, sure.
[01:58:38.455 --> 01:58:39.717]  One minute break, coming back.
[01:58:39.717 --> 01:58:40.658]  I want you to be able to finish up.
[01:58:40.658 --> 01:58:44.062]  That's so important because this is so real.
[01:58:44.062 --> 01:58:45.143]  And I get mad at myself.
[01:58:45.143 --> 01:58:46.625]  I haven't gotten ready like I should.
[01:58:46.625 --> 01:58:50.871]  I mean, this is, we're just putting it off, putting it off, putting it off, and all the signs are there.
[01:58:53.271 --> 01:58:55.573]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:58:55.573 --> 01:59:03.001]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:59:03.001 --> 01:59:04.743]  The new Survival Shield X2.
[01:59:06.089 --> 01:59:06.730]  We're good.
[01:59:23.783 --> 01:59:27.845]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:59:27.845 --> 01:59:31.606]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:59:31.606 --> 01:59:33.667]  Experience the new formula.
[01:59:33.667 --> 01:59:36.248]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:59:36.248 --> 01:59:37.588]  Shield your family.
[01:59:37.588 --> 01:59:39.389]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:59:55.478 --> 01:59:57.884]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:57.884 --> 02:00:00.671]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:08.530 --> 02:00:13.372]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:14.973]  You want answers?
[02:00:14.973 --> 02:00:16.493]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:16.493 --> 02:00:20.695]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:20.695 --> 02:00:24.797]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.192 --> 02:00:39.974]  Final segment with Bill Bonner, best-selling author, researcher, economist.
[02:00:39.974 --> 02:00:46.258]  Get Bill's book, thenumberone.com, if you want to be the first to get, Hormaggedon, How Much of a Good Thing Leads to Disaster.
[02:00:46.258 --> 02:00:52.783]  We're going to continue this discussion coming up after the break with Joel Skousen, looking at Ebola and more.
[02:00:52.783 --> 02:00:58.446]  But, sir, look, I mean, it's government prospectus, analysis, you name it.
[02:00:58.446 --> 02:00:59.987]  You'd write about this decades ago.
[02:00:59.987 --> 02:01:01.488]  Ron Paul would talk about it, as I said.
[02:01:01.488 --> 02:01:03.769]  People, oh, yeah, whatever, you're crazy.
[02:01:03.769 --> 02:01:04.330]  Now it's here.
[02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:06.641]  Or it's around the corner.
[02:01:06.641 --> 02:01:08.021]  I mean, it's getting close.
[02:01:08.021 --> 02:01:10.263]  No one can be in denial about this.
[02:01:10.263 --> 02:01:13.324]  Foreign governments are openly talking about it.
[02:01:13.324 --> 02:01:18.247]  Is there a way to have a soft landing, or is there any other points you think you should relay to people out there?
[02:01:18.247 --> 02:01:25.631]  Because I just don't know what all these masses of people, 100 million Americans on welfare, are going to do when things collapse.
[02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:28.773]  I mean, it just sounds like a science fiction time bomb.
[02:01:29.622 --> 02:01:35.590]  Well, it's Homer Gettin', that's what it is, and it's what happens when you get too much of what was essentially a good thing.
[02:01:35.590 --> 02:01:38.494]  A little bit of government's good, a lot of it's disastrous.
[02:01:38.494 --> 02:01:41.117]  A little bit of credit's good, a lot of it's disastrous.
[02:01:41.117 --> 02:01:45.002]  A little bit of sugar's good, but you eat too much of it and pretty soon you got the shakes.
[02:01:46.784 --> 02:01:50.708]  It's the same thing, and we're seeing a little bit of money, a little bit of credit.
[02:01:50.708 --> 02:01:50.989]  Good.
[02:01:50.989 --> 02:01:53.872]  But you put in too much and you're going to have a disaster.
[02:01:53.872 --> 02:02:02.781]  And the story of the last half of the century, the story of our time, the biggest story of our time, is this huge, huge run-up in credit caused by the change in the money system.
[02:02:03.459 --> 02:02:07.781]  And that we're going to see play out in our lives in the next five, ten years.
[02:02:07.781 --> 02:02:13.623]  I don't know exactly, but that is a story where it's not going to be very pretty, it's going to be very exciting.
[02:02:13.623 --> 02:02:19.045]  And I think everybody has to first protect themselves and then figure out how they're going to live through it.
[02:02:19.045 --> 02:02:22.066]  What kind of business they're going to be in, what kind of jobs, what kind of careers.
[02:02:22.586 --> 02:02:25.609]  And a lot of things are going to go away because there's just not going to be enough money for it.
[02:02:25.609 --> 02:02:29.292]  You know, we've seen that our society now is supported on credit.
[02:02:29.292 --> 02:02:34.677]  When that credit goes down, and it always does, because there's always, credit goes through a cycle just like everything else.
[02:02:34.677 --> 02:02:35.878]  It goes up and then it goes down.
[02:02:35.878 --> 02:02:40.523]  And when it goes down, a lot of people who are depending on it are not going to be very happy.
[02:02:40.523 --> 02:02:45.527]  And those people, you're talking about the 100 billion people, you know, getting welfare benefits, disability and so on.
[02:02:45.527 --> 02:02:48.090]  Those people are going to be in a tough position and they're not going to be too
[02:02:48.968 --> 02:02:51.069]  Too polite, I would guess.
[02:02:51.069 --> 02:02:54.831]  You know, you have to be prepared.
[02:02:54.831 --> 02:02:55.411]  Absolutely.
[02:02:55.411 --> 02:02:59.473]  Here's my final question to you in the two minutes, three minutes we've got left.
[02:02:59.473 --> 02:03:03.174]  You see them collapsing the border, wanting the unskilled people here.
[02:03:03.174 --> 02:03:11.858]  Cloward and Piven, we know, is a Democratic plan to collapse the economy, to politically enslave us and use the crisis to gain total dictatorial totalitarian control.
[02:03:13.371 --> 02:03:17.734]  And we see Cloward and Piven using other countries, agenda 21.
[02:03:17.734 --> 02:03:23.677]  I mean, I understand they're mismanagers and out of control, but it's easy to burn a house down if you're getting the insurance.
[02:03:23.677 --> 02:03:33.943]  I see that as the mafia tactic or in the back of the minds of the elite that are at least rationalizing that they've got some type of plan here.
[02:03:33.943 --> 02:03:39.006]  What is your take in closing on how it seems they're doing everything they can to exacerbate the collapse?
[02:03:39.912 --> 02:03:42.794]  Well, I don't think they intend to exacerbate the collapse.
[02:03:42.794 --> 02:03:45.336]  I mean, they intend to hold on to what they've got.
[02:03:45.336 --> 02:03:48.198]  And what they've got is a system that's inherently corrupt.
[02:03:48.198 --> 02:03:50.280]  You know, where they live on this money.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:58.266]  You know, we don't... I don't... You know, the government created something like 10 trillion dollars in this crisis in terms of guarantees and money printing and so on.
[02:03:58.266 --> 02:03:59.707]  I didn't get any of that money.
[02:03:59.707 --> 02:04:03.050]  But some people did, and those people are very, very eager to hold on to it.
[02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:06.632]  Some of them got little bits and pieces, like all those people who've got disabilities.
[02:04:06.632 --> 02:04:08.554]  And some of them got lots of it, like the bankers.
[02:04:09.094 --> 02:04:16.097]  And all those people want the thing to continue and there are now, you know, as I said, there are people, you could take a popular vote and those people win.
[02:04:16.097 --> 02:04:18.898]  So, uh, you know, that's not going to change.
[02:04:18.898 --> 02:04:24.681]  It's not that they, the elite, I don't think the elite consciously wants to see the system collapse so they can get more power.
[02:04:24.681 --> 02:04:25.841]  It's just the way it works.
[02:04:25.841 --> 02:04:30.183]  They naturally get more power as the system collapses because then they have more power.
[02:04:30.803 --> 02:04:32.404]  So either way, it is what it is.
[02:04:32.404 --> 02:04:33.065]  We're in deep crap.
[02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:38.048]  People need to research, need to read the book to find out from an expert on some good ideas and listen to other experts as well.
[02:04:38.048 --> 02:04:39.870]  Bill Bonner, I hope you'll come back again.
[02:04:39.870 --> 02:04:41.871]  This has been one of the most amazing interviews ever.
[02:04:41.871 --> 02:04:42.512]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:57.222 --> 02:04:57.582]  Thank you.
[02:04:57.582 --> 02:04:58.542]  It was my pleasure.
[02:04:58.542 --> 02:04:59.723]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:04:59.723 --> 02:05:02.924]  I'm really impressed.
[02:05:02.924 --> 02:05:06.745]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:05:06.745 --> 02:05:08.005]  I didn't taste dirt in it.
[02:05:08.005 --> 02:05:09.325]  God knows what's in there.
[02:05:09.325 --> 02:05:13.566]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:05:13.566 --> 02:05:19.308]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:05:19.488 --> 02:05:20.548]  That one is better.
[02:05:20.548 --> 02:05:21.768]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:05:21.768 --> 02:05:23.189]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.849]  It's good water.
[02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:29.830]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:37.071]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:05:37.071 --> 02:05:39.772]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:05:39.772 --> 02:05:47.693]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:05:47.833 --> 02:05:49.254]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:05:49.254 --> 02:05:50.035]  It's good water.
[02:05:50.035 --> 02:05:50.495]  Refreshing?
[02:05:50.495 --> 02:05:51.276]  It's good!

[02:06:03.124 --> 02:06:09.288]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:06:09.288 --> 02:06:13.852]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:06:13.852 --> 02:06:18.415]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:06:18.815 --> 02:06:21.756]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:06:21.756 --> 02:06:27.198]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:06:27.198 --> 02:06:34.580]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:38.721]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:06:38.721 --> 02:06:43.823]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:43.823 --> 02:06:44.683]  This is innovating.
[02:06:44.963 --> 02:06:52.449]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[02:08:11.542 --> 02:08:16.443]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:16.443 --> 02:08:25.406]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.406 --> 02:08:34.728]  We are witnessing the old political order being slayed right in front of us.
[02:08:34.728 --> 02:08:37.729]  And even though the globalists have controlled the old order, they want to see it
[02:08:39.042 --> 02:08:40.042]  Destroyed.
[02:08:40.042 --> 02:08:43.723]  Because out of that collapse, they will get even more power.
[02:08:43.723 --> 02:08:59.748]  And we just had Bill Bonner, who's an analyst you see on MSNBC, CNBC, you name it, best-selling books, basically saying what Ron Paul's saying, what Joel Skousen's saying, what I'm saying, what the history books say.
[02:08:59.748 --> 02:09:05.609]  And because of the technocracy and the plunge protection team and manipulation, they can keep this going a while.
[02:09:05.609 --> 02:09:08.230]  Maybe two years, maybe five years, maybe ten years.
[02:09:09.639 --> 02:09:16.960]  But more and more with the global destabilization going on and China threatening to grab islands from not just Japan but the Philippines and...
[02:09:18.237 --> 02:09:27.967]  Russia with their Bear Bombers coming into Western airspace, and you got Soros and NATO trying to overthrow things, but then that empowers Putin.
[02:09:27.967 --> 02:09:31.751]  There's sophisticated double and triple games going on here.
[02:09:31.751 --> 02:09:40.840]  It is very sophisticated, and I don't think Russia is our hope, by the way, as many people do, because our kleptocracy is so evil that, oh, well, this must be good over here.
[02:09:41.704 --> 02:09:45.335]  Like Russians under Soviet tyranny would think America was good.
[02:09:45.335 --> 02:09:48.323]  Those long process of corruption.
[02:09:50.929 --> 02:09:53.170]  That you see everywhere has just intensified.
[02:09:53.170 --> 02:09:56.872]  And then something like Ebola comes into the picture.
[02:09:56.872 --> 02:10:02.014]  And bringing the Ebola here, something I've never seen them do before, publicly.
[02:10:02.014 --> 02:10:08.196]  Germany, Spain, the US, putting them in labs that don't even have the highest level containment security.
[02:10:08.196 --> 02:10:12.338]  The collapsing of the border by Obama and the globalists.
[02:10:12.338 --> 02:10:15.259]  And there are children, as Biden said, we'll play that clip,
[02:10:16.022 --> 02:10:30.323]  And ISIS being turned loose all over the Middle East, and proxy wars with Iran, and Saudi Arabia, and... I know they've war-gamed this with computers and things, but I can just look at it and see chaos being turned out.
[02:10:32.805 --> 02:10:42.434]  And just incredible corruption and a unitary executive, as Ron Paul said two weeks ago on the show, no president in modern times has ever operated like this.
[02:10:42.434 --> 02:10:44.515]  Ron Paul believes a big event is coming closer.
[02:10:44.515 --> 02:10:47.918]  And there will be a chain of big events after that big event.
[02:10:47.918 --> 02:10:55.485]  But we had a guest on talking about road warrior type conditions being unstoppable sometime in the future.
[02:10:56.843 --> 02:11:13.068]  When collapse happens, and I see government preparing for that, while doing everything they can to selectively bring economic hardship to sectors they don't control, while consolidating control in their hands.
[02:11:13.068 --> 02:11:21.531]  Not a new type of tyranny, but an augmented system of class, of discrimination, of globalist class warfare,
[02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:29.634]  To unwash the masses, to dumb the masses down, to annihilate the middle class, to bring in Agenda 21.
[02:11:29.634 --> 02:11:34.598]  And it's a complex algorithm that they're using at multiple levels.
[02:11:34.598 --> 02:11:38.680]  And it's a lot of different sciences together and becomes an art form at the end of the day.
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:41.222]  A satanic art form is the only way to describe it.
[02:11:42.864 --> 02:11:48.986]  But I've studied enough to be able to see it and it just absolutely shakes me to my core.
[02:11:48.986 --> 02:11:52.967]  For society, I'm not even afraid physically for myself or even my children.
[02:11:52.967 --> 02:11:54.708]  I love them but it is what it is.
[02:11:54.708 --> 02:12:01.510]  It's that we are so judged now that you can see the heads of protection beginning to pull away from the West.
[02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:02.090]  You can see
[02:12:03.675 --> 02:12:06.117]  Government getting away with things they've never gotten away with.
[02:12:06.117 --> 02:12:08.218]  So, we got Joel Skousen for the hour.
[02:12:08.218 --> 02:12:11.900]  I appreciate him coming on WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:13.401]  JoelSkousen.com.
[02:12:13.401 --> 02:12:16.123]  He's the editor of WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[02:12:16.123 --> 02:12:20.925]  And, of course, he was a Marine Corps officer and a fighter-bomber in the Vietnam era.
[02:12:20.925 --> 02:12:23.767]  And he's the nephew of Cleon Skousen, wrote The Naked Communist.
[02:12:23.767 --> 02:12:27.830]  And he's been really out there tirelessly breaking things down.
[02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:29.411]  He wrote the best-selling book that we shall
[02:12:30.231 --> 02:12:33.612]  Strategic relocation that I just have been all over the country.
[02:12:33.612 --> 02:12:39.693]  I mean, I live in the Hill Country and just he knows everything about the Hill Country that only folks I've taught in the Hill Country knew.
[02:12:39.693 --> 02:12:42.294]  And then other areas, I mean, he's just, it's really the book.
[02:12:42.294 --> 02:12:46.435]  We made a film with him, a presentation that's augmented last year.
[02:12:46.435 --> 02:12:47.495]  So the two go together.
[02:12:47.495 --> 02:12:50.096]  He also wrote the Secure Home, the Bible of a Secure Home.
[02:12:50.096 --> 02:12:52.076]  I've used a lot of the stuff in it.
[02:12:52.076 --> 02:12:58.038]  It's available all three together discounted at all or individually discounted at infowarsstore.com.
[02:12:59.147 --> 02:13:01.348]  Or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:13:01.348 --> 02:13:06.071]  I'm not even trying to sell that today.
[02:13:06.071 --> 02:13:08.392]  I just think everybody should, obviously, should have it.
[02:13:08.392 --> 02:13:10.173]  But where should we start, Joel?
[02:13:10.173 --> 02:13:15.756]  Because I want to get you on about Ebola and what a real bioweapon release would look like.
[02:13:15.756 --> 02:13:18.478]  Just the panic alone, not even the real threat of the pathogen.
[02:13:19.238 --> 02:13:25.544]  What you currently think of this, I don't think it's going to end up being that big of an issue, but it's kind of a dress rehearsal, but we'll get your take.
[02:13:25.544 --> 02:13:35.933]  The Russia situation, the border, Obama, the unitary executive, you still think they want the incremental time plan, another 3, 4, 5 years?
[02:13:35.933 --> 02:13:42.740]  I don't disagree with you, but at the same time, my gut and just all the indicators, where should we start first, Joel Skousen?
[02:13:43.752 --> 02:13:45.032]  Well, thanks Alex.
[02:13:45.032 --> 02:13:50.513]  First of all, I want to compliment you on articulating the complexity of analysis of this.
[02:13:50.513 --> 02:13:51.634]  It's not unitary.
[02:13:51.634 --> 02:13:56.495]  It's not one single thing is going to be the trigger.
[02:13:56.495 --> 02:14:11.918]  This is a massive implementation of power on multiple structures from education to the medical, the control of the drug supply, the control of the free market in alternative medicines.
[02:14:13.158 --> 02:14:13.398]  I think?
[02:14:32.927 --> 02:14:54.567]  But when you see that no matter how much the outrage in the country about this influx of youth from Central America and the still open borders that we have, they do absolutely nothing except to continue to do what they're doing and that is to open car doors from Border Patrol are required to pick these people up
[02:14:55.575 --> 02:15:03.626]  Not arrest them, put them in the back seat, drive them to the latest relocation center, and then ship them all over the United States with their diseases.
[02:15:03.626 --> 02:15:07.951]  And the government is simply thumbing their nose at us.
[02:15:07.951 --> 02:15:12.297]  If anybody needed any convincing that this government isn't going to change...
[02:15:13.078 --> 02:15:15.539]  Then that's it, in my opinion.
[02:15:15.539 --> 02:15:17.600]  You could pick NSA spying.
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:19.880]  It doesn't matter what they say about reform.
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:21.401]  It's not going to stop.
[02:15:21.401 --> 02:15:25.562]  It didn't stop years ago when they told us they were shutting down the total awareness system.
[02:15:25.562 --> 02:15:30.804]  I mean, we literally have lost the Constitution and the country.
[02:15:30.804 --> 02:15:33.705]  They just haven't started locking up most people yet.
[02:15:33.705 --> 02:15:36.346]  They don't have a sufficient crisis to do that.
[02:15:36.346 --> 02:15:40.087]  And I don't think any of these smaller crises are going to lead to that.
[02:15:40.087 --> 02:15:42.268]  I still believe, going to the big picture,
[02:15:43.379 --> 02:15:58.750]  That they're waiting for a major world war to justify the total crackdown on dissidents, which this whole NSA system is really all about, building lists of dissidents, red, blue lists, you name it.
[02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:02.773]  They've probably got a dozen different lists that we're probably on, Alex.
[02:16:04.554 --> 02:16:13.343]  The point that I've tried to make in Strategic Relocation is that, you know, people keep wringing their hands and saying, you know, this is really terrible.
[02:16:13.343 --> 02:16:15.966]  But they keep being driven by these false hopes.
[02:16:15.966 --> 02:16:24.074]  The false hope that a Rand Paul is going to change something or that a new Republican president is going to suddenly turn this around if we just get Obama.
[02:16:24.074 --> 02:16:26.537]  They would just blame the collapse on him or shoot him in the head.
[02:16:27.608 --> 02:16:28.309]  That's right.
[02:16:28.309 --> 02:16:36.020]  Now, I don't think they're ever going to let even someone like Rand Paul, who's got some compromising problems, into the presidency.
[02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:38.363]  I think it's going to be a very controlled Republican.
[02:16:38.363 --> 02:16:41.848]  Well, that's because they've been tabbing his phone for years.
[02:16:41.848 --> 02:16:43.030]  They know he's just like his dad.
[02:16:45.285 --> 02:16:46.626]  Well, there are some differences.
[02:16:46.626 --> 02:16:48.647]  I mean, he isn't as strong as his dad is.
[02:16:48.647 --> 02:16:49.528]  No, no, I agree.
[02:16:49.528 --> 02:16:58.234]  He will compromise in politics a little bit, but I've known him since about 1995 and the papers have written about this and said, we know he's really like his dad.
[02:16:58.234 --> 02:16:59.795]  I'm saying he is a good man.
[02:16:59.795 --> 02:17:01.016]  He is a moral man.
[02:17:01.016 --> 02:17:02.417]  That's why they don't like him.
[02:17:02.417 --> 02:17:03.718]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:17:03.718 --> 02:17:09.923]  I mean, even someone like Mitt Romney was bending over backwards to please the establishment saying, let me into the presidency.
[02:17:10.663 --> 02:17:13.246]  And taking on every CFR advisor.
[02:17:13.246 --> 02:17:17.692]  They wouldn't let him in because he was a moral man and they didn't have dirt on him.
[02:17:17.692 --> 02:17:23.439]  I mean, that's how important it is for them to have somebody absolutely controllable in the White House.
[02:17:23.439 --> 02:17:27.985]  And anybody who thinks that Obama's sitting there at his desk making these decisions is fooling themselves.
[02:17:29.011 --> 02:17:34.412]  He takes orders, just like James Jones said at the Munich Security Conference.
[02:17:34.412 --> 02:17:39.953]  We take our daily marching orders at the National Security Council from Henry Kissinger and Associates.
[02:17:39.953 --> 02:17:42.374]  Not suggestions, daily marching orders.
[02:17:42.374 --> 02:17:43.574]  And I'm glad you mentioned that.
[02:17:43.574 --> 02:17:44.974]  That was like a year ago or so.
[02:17:44.974 --> 02:17:46.395]  We should pull that back up.
[02:17:46.395 --> 02:17:47.415]  2009, Alex.
[02:17:47.415 --> 02:17:47.435]  2009.
[02:17:47.435 --> 02:17:49.756]  Well, time just warps past us.
[02:17:52.301 --> 02:17:54.002]  Five years ago, I just can't believe it.
[02:17:54.002 --> 02:18:01.085]  This time is moving so fast that we take our orders from Henry Kissinger when he was heading up the National Security Council.
[02:18:01.085 --> 02:18:02.846]  It just shows how brazen they are.
[02:18:02.846 --> 02:18:07.829]  And like you said, now the evil is just out in the open.
[02:18:07.829 --> 02:18:08.849]  What is the point of that?
[02:18:08.849 --> 02:18:10.710]  Just to set the precedent and flaunt it?
[02:18:14.969 --> 02:18:16.393]  Yes, they do have a lot of that.
[02:18:16.393 --> 02:18:19.501]  I mean, look at the CFR website.
[02:18:19.501 --> 02:18:21.747]  Still has that James Jones quote.
[02:18:22.702 --> 02:18:31.968]  And his entire speech admitting to this conspiracy that Henry Kissinger controls daily, they still have it up on their website!
[02:18:31.968 --> 02:18:41.574]  I mean that's as in the face as you get and it's also very telling because not a single news media source has ever published or even commented on that.
[02:18:41.574 --> 02:18:44.896]  So they're very arrogant about the level of the control.
[02:18:44.896 --> 02:18:49.219]  What I was saying though Alex is that people have to realize that
[02:18:50.299 --> 02:18:58.747]  Even though we have to keep fighting, even though we have to keep waking up the remnant, we have to prepare for resistance, people have to survive what's coming.
[02:18:58.747 --> 02:19:03.392]  They have to survive the war they're planning to bring upon us, which is going to make 9-11 look like a picnic.
[02:19:03.392 --> 02:19:04.413]  No, no, you're right.
[02:19:04.413 --> 02:19:09.077]  And you were saying that years ago, and now my brain is completely shifting into the understanding that this is all...
[02:19:09.798 --> 02:19:12.522]  We're in the hands of pure evil and it's just going to get worse.
[02:19:12.522 --> 02:19:13.163]  God help us.
[02:19:13.163 --> 02:19:15.767]  I mean, we can try to get America to wake up and repent.
[02:19:15.767 --> 02:19:22.618]  We can try to change things, but we're in the hands of absolutely evil people who want to wreck everything.
[02:19:24.827 --> 02:19:26.568]  And so people have to be prepared.
[02:19:26.568 --> 02:19:33.753]  I mean, they've got to... You know, a lot of people, and I do a lot of consultation about strategic relocation, and people say, well, I just can't leave right now.
[02:19:33.753 --> 02:19:35.294]  And I understand that.
[02:19:35.294 --> 02:19:42.899]  The worst thing people can do is get out of the boondocks without any financial lifeline and try to survive because self-sufficiency is expensive.
[02:19:42.899 --> 02:19:44.801]  But they have to look up to reality.
[02:19:44.801 --> 02:19:47.783]  It's not a matter of if you're going to have to get out of the big cities.
[02:19:47.783 --> 02:19:49.444]  It's a matter of when.
[02:19:49.444 --> 02:19:52.206]  So you have to take a certain amount of your resources
[02:19:52.506 --> 02:19:52.827]  That's right.
[02:19:52.827 --> 02:19:53.748]  We're gonna go on a break, Joel.
[02:19:53.748 --> 02:19:54.349]  Come back with that.
[02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:56.392]  It's like Matt Drudge said earlier this year or last year.
[02:19:56.392 --> 02:19:56.772]  I forget.
[02:19:56.772 --> 02:19:58.335]  Might have been five years ago.
[02:19:58.335 --> 02:19:58.755]  Who knows?
[02:19:58.755 --> 02:20:00.318]  He said everybody should have an exit plan.
[02:20:02.395 --> 02:20:07.218]  Summer is here and nothing looks better than tan skin and white teeth.
[02:20:07.218 --> 02:20:10.760]  Hi, I'm Jonathan Greenhut, the CEO of Power Swabs.
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:16.343]  And if you want to have whiter teeth in 5 minutes, then try clinically proven Power Swabs.
[02:20:16.343 --> 02:20:22.106]  Power Swabs whitens teeth on average 2 shades in 5 minutes and 6 shades in 7 days.
[02:20:22.106 --> 02:20:26.669]  Better yet, it removes stains on natural teeth as well as caps, crowns, and veneers.
[02:20:26.949 --> 02:20:35.537]  Power Swabs is so effective that thousands of professional dentists have used it nationwide and now you can try it without paying a visit to the dentist.

[02:20:59.757 --> 02:21:04.340]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:17.350]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[02:21:18.391 --> 02:21:20.313]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[02:21:20.313 --> 02:21:22.515]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[02:21:22.515 --> 02:21:28.941]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:21:28.941 --> 02:21:37.529]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[02:21:37.529 --> 02:21:42.974]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[02:21:43.214 --> 02:21:50.161]  To get your FAKE TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to FAKETV.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:21:50.161 --> 02:21:50.541]  That's 877-532-5388.
[02:21:50.541 --> 02:21:51.662]  Or go to FAKETV.com.
[02:21:51.662 --> 02:21:53.303]  FAKE TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:22:01.551 --> 02:22:05.533]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[02:22:05.533 --> 02:22:08.775]  I'm sure you know, this economy sucks!
[02:22:08.775 --> 02:22:14.678]  We all realize that the American economy is tremendously unstable right now and will likely get much worse.
[02:22:14.678 --> 02:22:23.563]  There's monumental debt, government bailouts, stock and real estate bubbles that are primed to pop at any moment which can flush away most or all of your retirement savings.
[02:22:23.843 --> 02:22:26.705]  This type of movement has enormous consequences.
[02:22:26.705 --> 02:22:32.129]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[02:22:32.129 --> 02:22:35.010]  Financial trouble is right here at our doorstep.
[02:22:35.010 --> 02:22:41.114]  But if you move right now and develop a backup plan immediately, this could be the most profitable time of your life.
[02:22:41.114 --> 02:22:46.358]  Proportionally, more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in our history.

[02:22:55.862 --> 02:23:01.324]  888-507-8789 and prepare to profit as history repeats itself.
[02:23:01.324 --> 02:23:08.347]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic and only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:23:08.347 --> 02:23:09.748]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:23:09.748 --> 02:23:15.190]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience, just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:23:15.410 --> 02:23:17.752]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[02:23:17.752 --> 02:23:19.654]  So stop paying for Silver Solutions.
[02:23:19.654 --> 02:23:25.240]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other Silver Solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:29.043]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[02:23:29.043 --> 02:23:30.545]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[02:23:30.981 --> 02:23:34.524]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird.
[02:23:34.524 --> 02:23:38.887]  Because they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases.
[02:23:38.887 --> 02:23:41.189]  Then my folks both got a Blocket Pocket.
[02:23:41.189 --> 02:23:43.991]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation.
[02:23:43.991 --> 02:23:46.653]  Dad knows it keeps his information private.
[02:23:46.653 --> 02:23:49.655]  I like my Blocket Pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking.
[02:23:49.655 --> 02:23:50.596]  Awesome!
[02:23:50.596 --> 02:23:52.958]  BlocketPocket.com has other cool stuff too.
[02:23:52.958 --> 02:23:55.500]  Huh, guess my parents aren't so weird.
[02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:57.962]  Get your Blocket Pocket at BlocketPocket.com.
[02:24:25.736 --> 02:24:29.418]  You know, I've been talking about these issues for a long time.
[02:24:31.101 --> 02:24:36.526]  And people say, oh, you're being a fear monger, but you notice how much of this has come true.
[02:24:36.526 --> 02:24:47.375]  And under the North American Union, it basically says in the treaty they'll get rid of the borders with Mexico and Canada, that Bush did up with Vicente Fox in 2005.
[02:24:47.375 --> 02:24:52.800]  But just like Matt Drudge tweeted, and we'll put that up on screen here in a moment, that everybody should have an exit plan,
[02:24:54.569 --> 02:24:59.891]  Back in January of this year, January 28, he said have an exit plan.
[02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:07.253]  Matt Drudge, at Matt Drudge, or at Drudge is actually how you get there on Twitter, the media attacked him for that.
[02:25:07.253 --> 02:25:15.516]  While governments all have exit plans, bodyguards, bunkers, weapons, food, we're not supposed to have backup generators.
[02:25:15.516 --> 02:25:19.618]  In fact, that's in the news all the time, demonizing people that want to be prepared.
[02:25:19.618 --> 02:25:23.379]  No, just be a slob, be on welfare, don't care about anything.
[02:25:24.375 --> 02:25:25.476]  Whatever, it's fine.
[02:25:25.476 --> 02:25:26.516]  Joel Skousen is our guest.
[02:25:26.516 --> 02:25:27.937]  I want to talk more about preparedness.
[02:25:27.937 --> 02:25:33.721]  I don't want to look at things geopolitically, but why would an Anglo-American elite
[02:25:34.898 --> 02:25:40.122]  Want to have a dumbed down servile population, I guess so they'd be pliable.
[02:25:40.122 --> 02:25:42.744]  It's just that I look at all the things they're doing.
[02:25:42.744 --> 02:25:54.872]  What do you think the big strategic plan on 17% of the 60 plus thousand kids or only 17% of the kids that have poured in and the adults that have poured in in the last year?
[02:25:54.872 --> 02:25:58.135]  My concern is that it's meant to get an even bigger wave to come in.
[02:25:58.855 --> 02:26:03.677]  Out of Central and South America, and use that crisis to bring in the next level of control.
[02:26:03.677 --> 02:26:07.279]  What do you think the big picture is about, Joel Skousen, on the border?
[02:26:07.279 --> 02:26:24.766]  Well, ultimately it is about watering down the politics of the United States, watering down conservative values, and also there clearly is going to be more and more draconian federal powers allocated to the government to supposedly take care of this border crisis, which
[02:26:25.686 --> 02:26:26.046]  I don't know.
[02:26:47.574 --> 02:26:49.434]  People, Americans, just aren't safe.
[02:26:49.434 --> 02:26:55.637]  A lot of kidnapping, a lot of execution of businessmen in their cars as they drive to work.
[02:26:55.637 --> 02:26:59.960]  This is, you know, forget about relocation to Central America.
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:04.322]  Even Costa Rica now is not going to be exempt over time.
[02:27:04.322 --> 02:27:11.605]  The old expat, live cheap, live safe in Latin America is going to be a thing of the past here within the next five years.
[02:27:13.322 --> 02:27:19.467]  But ultimately, I think it's a combination of things that will add up.
[02:27:19.467 --> 02:27:23.531]  Not that the border crisis will create complete social unrest.
[02:27:23.531 --> 02:27:25.012]  It won't by itself.
[02:27:25.012 --> 02:27:27.514]  It certainly is going to continue to overwhelm the system.
[02:27:27.514 --> 02:27:32.398]  And you know it's purposeful, Alex, when in the Obamacare system, you know, they open the doors to
[02:27:33.955 --> 02:27:34.755]  Illegals.
[02:27:34.755 --> 02:27:40.436]  The TSA opens and doesn't put any requirements on them to need any identification to travel around the country.
[02:27:40.436 --> 02:27:46.277]  And now they're enlisting churches around the country in order to take these poor little orphans in.
[02:27:46.277 --> 02:27:51.318]  I mean, the problem is we need to seal that border and nobody's talking about that.
[02:27:51.318 --> 02:27:53.839]  We can't do any of that with Obama in office.
[02:27:53.839 --> 02:27:56.419]  He obviously won't do it, but we couldn't do it when Bush was in office.
[02:27:56.419 --> 02:28:01.280]  You know, that's when Congress authorized the money and Bush refused to finish the fence.
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:11.666]  And what the administration did was increase the parameters of the fence to be so expensive and costly that they simply complained that they didn't have the money to do it.
[02:28:11.666 --> 02:28:23.394]  For less than a billion dollars, you could put a double strand of ten foot high fence with concertina wire on it and believe me, that's going to slow things down to a crawl that you can manage.
[02:28:23.394 --> 02:28:24.215]  But they won't do that.
[02:28:24.215 --> 02:28:31.460]  They want to spend two billion dollars this year and three billion dollars next year on humanitarian crisis that's going to continue to fester.
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:47.633]  So I think what's happening is that you take this into consideration with land-use planning, putting everybody into high-density urban areas, making people more dependent on EBT cards through a continued bailout through unemployment compensation and food stamps.
[02:28:48.354 --> 02:28:49.035]  And what have you got?
[02:28:49.035 --> 02:28:52.277]  You've got people totally dependent on the government.
[02:28:52.277 --> 02:28:57.281]  And as you carefully pointed out, they're preparing to get out of the cities.
[02:28:57.281 --> 02:29:01.324]  They have homes with bunkers underneath them.
[02:29:01.324 --> 02:29:04.647]  They have their escape plans.
[02:29:04.647 --> 02:29:07.989]  FEMA doesn't tell anything about fallout shelters.
[02:29:07.989 --> 02:29:09.671]  That's laughed upon by the media.
[02:29:10.351 --> 02:29:19.556]  Even though that's the one thing that the elite know that they're going to need someday because they know this nuclear war is coming on America, at least it's coming to the American military.
[02:29:19.556 --> 02:29:23.078]  I don't think Russia and China are going to strike American cities.
[02:29:23.078 --> 02:29:25.099]  They don't want to be viewed as the bullies of the world.
[02:29:25.099 --> 02:29:28.501]  They're taking down the bully of the world and striking the U.S.
[02:29:28.501 --> 02:29:28.982]  military.
[02:29:29.742 --> 02:29:34.344]  So I think people can survive what's coming, but they really have to prepare.
[02:29:34.344 --> 02:29:36.704]  And the government doesn't want people prepared.
[02:29:36.704 --> 02:29:40.946]  They want as much chaos when the majors strike.
[02:29:40.946 --> 02:29:42.206]  I agree with you, Joel Skousen.
[02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:42.626]  Stay there.
[02:29:42.626 --> 02:29:45.908]  We're gonna come back into a bunch of other news and take calls.
[02:29:45.908 --> 02:29:46.408]  Stay with us.
[02:29:46.408 --> 02:29:48.148]  We got callers from before earlier.
[02:29:48.148 --> 02:29:49.749]  We'll see who wants to talk to Joel.
[02:29:49.749 --> 02:29:51.610]  I'm sure most of them do.
[02:29:51.610 --> 02:29:53.010]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.010 --> 02:29:55.531]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.531 --> 02:29:58.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.836 --> 02:30:05.059]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:30:05.059 --> 02:30:13.109]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:30:13.109 --> 02:30:20.318]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:30:20.638 --> 02:30:25.262]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that is good stuff.
[02:30:25.262 --> 02:30:35.890]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:30:35.890 --> 02:30:42.375]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:30:42.375 --> 02:30:44.937]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:30:44.937 --> 02:30:48.580]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:50.702]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[02:31:02.735 --> 02:31:09.763]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:09.923 --> 02:31:12.245]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:12.245 --> 02:31:17.509]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:17.509 --> 02:31:22.693]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:22.693 --> 02:31:25.736]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:26.016 --> 02:31:30.080]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:34.405]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:34.405 --> 02:31:44.635]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:44.635 --> 02:31:47.158]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:31:47.358 --> 02:31:55.550]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[02:32:03.647 --> 02:32:05.008]  In the near future.
[02:32:05.008 --> 02:32:09.490]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:32:09.490 --> 02:32:10.711]  Security alert.
[02:32:10.711 --> 02:32:12.712]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:32:12.712 --> 02:32:16.414]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[02:32:16.414 --> 02:32:19.015]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[02:32:19.275 --> 02:32:21.296]  We are the ones responsible.
[02:32:21.296 --> 02:32:23.877]  Prime Director didn't credit Alex Jones.
[02:32:23.877 --> 02:32:26.738]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:32:26.738 --> 02:32:29.979]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:32:29.979 --> 02:32:32.259]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:32:32.259 --> 02:32:33.800]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:36.621]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:32:36.621 --> 02:32:38.581]  They are never going to stop.
[02:32:38.581 --> 02:32:42.643]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:32:46.244 --> 02:32:52.970]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.268 --> 02:33:26.930]  We've got your calls coming up.
[02:33:26.930 --> 02:33:28.371]  I appreciate the callers holding.
[02:33:28.371 --> 02:33:31.133]  Some of them were on that I didn't get to in the first hour.
[02:33:31.133 --> 02:33:37.676]  Then another guest came on on basically the same topic we're discussing now, because that's what I'm concerned with, so I just tend to have guests on that
[02:33:38.683 --> 02:33:38.963]  Thank you.
[02:34:03.473 --> 02:34:05.814]  I have storable foods in multiple locations.
[02:34:05.814 --> 02:34:06.914]  This is who I get it from.
[02:34:06.914 --> 02:34:12.917]  It's high-quality, non-GMO, great customer service, last 20 years, in plastic boxes that are easy to move.
[02:34:12.917 --> 02:34:19.199]  866-229-0927, mypatriotsupply.com, forward slash Alex.
[02:34:19.199 --> 02:34:22.920]  I think something's wrong with you if you don't have water filtration and storable food.
[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:25.921]  I mean, even poor people should be able to stockpile something.
[02:34:27.862 --> 02:34:32.464]  Stuff winds down, and even if it's five years away, ten years away, I think it's a lot closer than that.
[02:34:32.464 --> 02:34:35.545]  Things are just... I mean, the slide is always happening.
[02:34:35.545 --> 02:34:37.466]  Things are degrading.

[02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:06.331]  Yeah, I do, Alex.
[02:37:06.331 --> 02:37:16.055]  Let me just cover, there's been a lot of hype on the net about BRICS bringing down the dollar with their own $100 billion slush fund for Africa.
[02:37:16.055 --> 02:37:17.756]  That's never going to happen.
[02:37:17.756 --> 02:37:19.276]  That's just propaganda.
[02:37:19.276 --> 02:37:26.059]  They're not putting $100 billion of their own money into something as long as the West is willing to throw in limited funds at Africa.
[02:37:26.059 --> 02:37:27.640]  It's very interesting with all of the
[02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:29.482]  They've all been devaluing.
[02:37:48.004 --> 02:37:49.325]  They've all been devaluated.
[02:37:49.325 --> 02:38:00.971]  They love dollar devaluation or dollar inflation because they can hide their own inflation under that dollar inflation and keep their level inflation relatively the same as the dollar.
[02:38:00.971 --> 02:38:03.592]  But big things have small beginnings.
[02:38:03.592 --> 02:38:09.375]  I mean, down the road, as the dollar is devalued, won't the globalists try to bring out their new digital currency?
[02:38:10.015 --> 02:38:19.863]  I don't think any of that happens until war comes, because you've got to have a global new government in order to have a global currency, whether it's digital or real, etc.
[02:38:19.863 --> 02:38:23.846]  And so that's one of the things they've got tucked into their war package.
[02:38:23.846 --> 02:38:28.530]  As soon as war comes, which war will take out most of the computer systems in the U.S.
[02:38:28.530 --> 02:38:37.438]  because of EMP and other strikes, and they'll have an excuse then to go to a new currency, but you've got to have a world government to govern it, and right now
[02:38:38.143 --> 02:38:45.594]  You know, they've got to put themselves in charge of the world government so that they can manage that new world currency, which won't be any different than the rest.
[02:38:45.594 --> 02:38:50.701]  It'll just be a new beginning and an excuse to manage it on a global level.
[02:38:52.671 --> 02:39:12.540]  Relative to Russia and the Ukraine, I appreciate what you said about the many people on our side of the political spectrum, Paul Craig Roberts and others, who have mistakenly thought Putin's our hero, Putin's the salvation against our globalist warmongers, and he is not.
[02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:17.422]  Putin has just as much of a warmongering agenda as our globalists, and so does China.
[02:39:17.422 --> 02:39:20.404]  There are three major predator centers in the world, not one,
[02:39:21.312 --> 02:39:31.334]  And even though I think the globalists intend to give us this war, Russia's going to be eliminated in the long term, and then it's going to be the globalists versus China.
[02:39:31.334 --> 02:39:32.835]  But that's a different story.
[02:39:32.835 --> 02:39:43.977]  But it's very important for people who understand the globalist threat not to think that Russia is somehow our savior or fighting against the globalists.
[02:39:43.977 --> 02:39:48.378]  He's all more than willing to let the globalists become the bully of the world to justify
[02:39:49.420 --> 02:39:51.395]  China and his strike on the West.
[02:39:51.929 --> 02:39:59.735]  Which is coming, and that's why the probes of the Bear Bombers, which there were 16 of those last month, they're probing our air defense system.
[02:39:59.735 --> 02:40:05.800]  It doesn't mean that war is imminent, but it does mean that there's a long-term agenda towards getting ready.
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:13.146]  As I say, Russia and China won't have their top-of-the-line weapon systems coming online until the beginning of the next decade.
[02:40:13.146 --> 02:40:20.612]  That's when I see the war thing loom, and I think they can keep this economy kicking the can down the road till then.
[02:40:21.292 --> 02:40:28.497]  And I fully view their moderate levels of inflation.
[02:40:28.497 --> 02:40:31.198]  That is, and I'm saying moderate, is below 10 percent.
[02:40:31.198 --> 02:40:35.221]  The real inflation rate is 6 to 7 to 8 percent.
[02:40:35.221 --> 02:40:36.882]  But we've lived with that for 20 years.
[02:40:36.882 --> 02:40:40.344]  We can continue to adjust to that as long as they keep it below 10 percent.
[02:40:41.625 --> 02:40:45.728]  And they will continue to bail out the Euro as well during this period.
[02:40:45.728 --> 02:40:50.231]  Well, Joel, for me the big wild card is a human awakening, people repenting.
[02:40:50.231 --> 02:41:04.861]  And I don't mean going to a megachurch and being taught name it and claim it mumbo-jumbo, but really realizing we're in the hands of a maniacal wickedness that just really wants to hurt life and really wants to play God and vandalize God's creation.
[02:41:05.939 --> 02:41:07.020]  Just basic evil.
[02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:08.081]  Even people who don't believe in God.
[02:41:08.081 --> 02:41:11.564]  I mean, you study these people, they are a bunch of devils.
[02:41:11.564 --> 02:41:14.466]  And so the devil's real, whether people believe the devil's real or not.
[02:41:14.466 --> 02:41:19.210]  These globalists operate like, you know, the mythical creature we've all been told about.
[02:41:19.210 --> 02:41:20.411]  And they just really are nasty.
[02:41:20.411 --> 02:41:23.493]  They make Loki look like a good guy from Norse mythology.
[02:41:23.493 --> 02:41:29.478]  I want to go to these phone calls, but I want you to think about this in an answer at the end of the show, because I want you to really mull it over.
[02:41:30.905 --> 02:41:40.900]  If there was a big enough coming back to God, people repenting, seeking God's face, turning from our wicked ways, really realizing how much danger we're in.
[02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:44.145]  And I do see a huge awakening happening, but it's not fast enough.
[02:41:44.145 --> 02:41:46.088]  And people really got what was going on.
[02:41:46.909 --> 02:41:50.651]  That we could change things and we could reverse this.
[02:41:50.651 --> 02:41:54.113]  But there does seem to be like a fatalistic, this is the way it's meant to be.
[02:41:54.113 --> 02:41:56.515]  The big churches just say, get behind it.
[02:41:56.515 --> 02:41:58.696]  It was foreordained.
[02:41:58.696 --> 02:42:01.638]  But then they're not involved politically to fight evil.
[02:42:01.638 --> 02:42:02.658]  So they actually ate it.
[02:42:02.658 --> 02:42:04.940]  So it's adjoining with evil.
[02:42:05.980 --> 02:42:06.160]  Well,
[02:42:33.089 --> 02:42:39.691]  It's a tough question, Alex, because I don't think, in fact, that the world is going to repent, even though there is an awakening.
[02:42:39.691 --> 02:42:40.731]  It's very real.
[02:42:40.731 --> 02:42:42.052]  It's growing on our side.
[02:42:42.052 --> 02:42:44.252]  It's growing even faster on the other side.
[02:42:44.252 --> 02:42:54.535]  The amount of people corrupted, I mean, even conservative children, Christian children, the percentage that we're losing to the world each year is increasing rather than decreasing.
[02:42:54.535 --> 02:42:55.936]  We're not holding our children.
[02:42:56.796 --> 02:43:04.359]  And that's a lot because of the influence of public schooling, the vaccine requirement driving people into public schooling.
[02:43:04.359 --> 02:43:06.460]  All of this is very, very bad.
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:11.443]  So I view and also, you know, I've been in this battle since the early 70s and I was
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:24.226]  I have watched every single major funder of true conservative, libertarian, Christian causes go by the wayside.
[02:43:24.226 --> 02:43:29.449]  It's almost like the Lord is not supporting those that would have us win.
[02:43:29.449 --> 02:43:32.051]  We're barely getting enough support to stay ahead.
[02:43:32.951 --> 02:43:37.255]  And yet they have tons of money growing on their side.
[02:43:37.255 --> 02:43:39.156]  And it isn't that the Lord agrees with them.
[02:43:39.156 --> 02:43:41.598]  It isn't the Lord doesn't love what we're doing.
[02:43:41.598 --> 02:43:50.045]  I think, though, that he knows that the laws of justice require, because the majority of wickedness in the world, there's got to be retribution for that.
[02:43:50.045 --> 02:43:52.807]  But at the same time, I think he's preparing a remnant to survive.
[02:43:52.807 --> 02:43:56.650]  I think that's why we grow the movement.
[02:43:56.650 --> 02:43:58.992]  I've stopped preaching winning the battle.
[02:44:00.003 --> 02:44:04.386]  The only winning that I think we can do is winning the hearts and minds of good people.
[02:44:04.386 --> 02:44:18.175]  So what I like is the division of society is that the good are getting better in a smaller minority and the evil are getting worse and it's the clash of civilizations that the Lord, I believe, is going to let play out.
[02:44:20.933 --> 02:44:26.356]  Well, undoubtedly, when the depression hits, when the war comes, when whatever, it is going to be hell on earth.
[02:44:26.356 --> 02:44:43.125]  I mean, if 90% of people were self-sufficient, or were rural, most of them self-sufficient, in the depression, and millions starved to death, major university studies show, and that was kind of swept under the rug, if 90% is now flipped, are urban,
[02:44:46.249 --> 02:44:50.791]  And of that, I know you're the big expert on this, correct me if I'm wrong, about half of those are self-sufficient.
[02:44:50.791 --> 02:44:53.752]  So 5% are self-sufficient.
[02:44:53.752 --> 02:44:55.093]  I think about my grandfather.
[02:44:55.093 --> 02:45:04.797]  My dad's dad could literally work on any type of engine, fix roofs, plumb, you know, work on electrical, work 18 hours a day if he needed to.
[02:45:04.797 --> 02:45:07.158]  My dad knows a ton more than I do.
[02:45:08.118 --> 02:45:12.541]  I mean, I'm literally a blithering idiot when it comes to technical stuff and gardening compared to my dad.
[02:45:12.541 --> 02:45:15.503]  He's not half as good as his dad was.
[02:45:15.503 --> 02:45:20.367]  He's great at, like, you know, medical stuff and financing and things and, you know, at work.
[02:45:20.367 --> 02:45:22.028]  He's good at worldly stuff.
[02:45:22.028 --> 02:45:23.529]  And I'm like a creature of the world.
[02:45:23.529 --> 02:45:24.369]  I know how to use a gun.
[02:45:24.369 --> 02:45:26.231]  I know how to fight.
[02:45:26.231 --> 02:45:28.773]  But, I mean, most men don't even know how to do that now.
[02:45:28.773 --> 02:45:30.594]  So it's just like a degeneration.
[02:45:30.594 --> 02:45:32.215]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:45:32.215 --> 02:45:32.775]  Right, Alex.
[02:45:32.775 --> 02:45:36.278]  But 80% of those that are preparing are still urban.
[02:45:37.363 --> 02:45:42.146]  They're not rural, and that's the problem, is that they've got to make plans to get rural.
[02:45:42.146 --> 02:45:52.413]  I'm not saying that people have to leave right now, but they've got to make contingency plans to get rural and prepare to be self-sufficient in a rural, especially with Ebola racing its head.
[02:45:52.413 --> 02:45:55.876]  Like you, I don't think this is going to be a major imminent plague.
[02:45:56.696 --> 02:46:00.519]  It will happen later, but they've certainly introduced this into the United States.
[02:46:00.519 --> 02:46:01.680]  This is very dangerous.
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:03.642]  It is a very serious virus.
[02:46:03.642 --> 02:46:06.685]  It's not like anything else that we've seen before.
[02:46:06.685 --> 02:46:12.109]  Very hard to eliminate.
[02:46:12.109 --> 02:46:15.632]  But these things, you know, I think have been bioengineered.
[02:46:15.632 --> 02:46:19.115]  I think there's a patent involved with the Ebola virus.
[02:46:19.115 --> 02:46:24.480]  And they're messing with fire because they themselves cannot be immune to these things as well.
[02:46:25.305 --> 02:46:26.166]  Well that's it.
[02:46:26.166 --> 02:46:33.310]  There's always a lust in the heart of the evil people that turn themselves over to it to push further and further until they destroy themselves.
[02:46:33.310 --> 02:46:39.915]  That's basic criminology and it's just so wild to see evil manifesting at this level.
[02:46:40.655 --> 02:46:47.977]  Well, this is a satanic conspiracy we're dealing with and Satan does want to actually kill billions of people in the world.
[02:46:47.977 --> 02:46:55.499]  There will be these kinds of, you know, and you have to have what sane person on earth would engineer these kind of viruses.
[02:46:55.499 --> 02:46:57.420]  They're not working for themselves.
[02:46:57.420 --> 02:47:01.081]  They're not working for just a mafioso type individual.
[02:47:01.081 --> 02:47:03.881]  They're working for the master of all evil.
[02:47:03.881 --> 02:47:04.822]  And I'm not saying at the
[02:47:06.104 --> 02:47:07.945]  Great Alex, thank you very much for taking my call.
[02:47:07.945 --> 02:47:08.506]  I've got an idea.
[02:47:35.922 --> 02:47:45.145]  You know, you talk about everybody out here that wants to wake up other people and get out and make your own internet site or YouTube page or YouTube.
[02:47:45.145 --> 02:47:50.586]  And what I think is, um, I was looking at your, uh, your, your interview with Billy Corgan.
[02:47:50.586 --> 02:47:52.607]  It was like the day after Christmas.
[02:47:52.607 --> 02:47:59.689]  And he was talking about, you know, you could put all the facts and, you know, everything right there in front of people.
[02:47:59.689 --> 02:48:03.790]  Not everybody is going to be able to like grasp that or even accept it.
[02:48:03.790 --> 02:48:05.531]  I mean, uh, did you agree with him?
[02:48:07.930 --> 02:48:11.751]  Well, you know what, I just, I don't think I fully understand your point.
[02:48:11.751 --> 02:48:13.272]  I mean, what are you saying?
[02:48:13.272 --> 02:48:26.395]  Okay, my point is, in order to break past the, you know, everybody watching Out My Balls on Fox and MSNBC, you know what I mean, when I see them discredit you, they don't have anything.
[02:48:26.395 --> 02:48:27.376]  Like, they don't show anything.
[02:48:27.376 --> 02:48:29.276]  They're just like, oh, the government's corrupting the world.
[02:48:29.276 --> 02:48:30.096]  No, no, I hear what you're saying.
[02:48:30.096 --> 02:48:30.817]  I appreciate your call.
[02:48:30.817 --> 02:48:31.417]  It's a great point.
[02:48:32.236 --> 02:48:35.399]  The enemy's propaganda is so dumbed down and so mindless.
[02:48:35.399 --> 02:48:43.207]  The propaganda itself is an artificial reality to keep people dumb from birth to where we intellectually can't even talk to them.
[02:48:43.207 --> 02:48:50.614]  It's like 1984, they're telling folks don't fly into different Asian countries with it now because the police state doesn't like it.
[02:48:50.614 --> 02:48:53.557]  I mean, it's like Hillary uses 1984 as an instruction manual.
[02:48:54.801 --> 02:48:58.224]  How do you deal with such dumbed-down culture?
[02:48:58.224 --> 02:49:05.932]  And I think, Joel, that's their secret, is that they just dumb everybody down and make them poor, and then people that are aware can't even communicate with them.
[02:49:07.895 --> 02:49:18.919]  Well, there's another aspect to this, another dimension, that is, that there is an innate soul in each person, and many of those people are resistant to higher truths, to tough truths.
[02:49:18.919 --> 02:49:19.919]  They don't like them.
[02:49:19.919 --> 02:49:22.700]  You can tell that when you go out to talk to people.
[02:49:22.700 --> 02:49:25.941]  Their eyes glaze over, I don't want to hear this, you make me uncomfortable.
[02:49:27.122 --> 02:49:29.484]  And that's what we're dealing with as well.
[02:49:29.484 --> 02:49:35.009]  That's something that cannot be overcome by environmentalism, education, or otherwise.
[02:49:35.009 --> 02:49:39.152]  So I'm not a believer that we could reach everybody if we simply had the right message.
[02:49:39.152 --> 02:49:43.416]  We're looking for the people who sense truth, that sense that something's wrong.
[02:49:43.416 --> 02:49:44.998]  That's the only people I deal with.
[02:49:46.087 --> 02:49:52.928]  Absolutely, more and more I've learned, just people want to laugh at you or whatever, just move on, triage them, move to people that want to hear the truth.
[02:49:52.928 --> 02:50:00.249]  There's so many of those, we could never run out of folks, we need to come together.
[02:50:00.249 --> 02:50:08.231]  I tell you, Joel, as bad as things are getting, it's nothing compared to when this system really comes in.
[02:50:08.231 --> 02:50:13.272]  What are all the people that have bought into the system going to do as it falls apart on them?
[02:50:13.272 --> 02:50:15.272]  Are they going to double down and worship it even more?
[02:50:17.072 --> 02:50:18.488]  I think that they're going to be so...
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:21.140]  There's no other choice for them.
[02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:23.521]  They see that only government can save them.
[02:50:23.521 --> 02:50:34.645]  That's the beauty of the globalists bringing a nuclear attack on American military, is that everybody suddenly has a panic feeling, and all over the world, if the U.S.
[02:50:34.645 --> 02:50:36.626]  military's gone, what are we going to do?
[02:50:36.626 --> 02:50:40.407]  And those leaders will come out of their bunker and say, we're coming to save you.
[02:50:40.407 --> 02:50:48.010]  It'll be a global militarized, we'll band together, we'll throw out the communists, call it the League of Democracies, and we'll start all over again.
[02:50:48.550 --> 02:50:52.452]  You know, it's like socialism fails time and again, and yet what's their solution?
[02:50:52.452 --> 02:50:53.353]  More socialism.
[02:50:53.353 --> 02:50:55.314]  We need more control.
[02:50:55.314 --> 02:50:58.035]  They never stop, and we can't either.
[02:50:58.035 --> 02:51:01.657]  But the final equation, it's all about our test here on this planet.
[02:51:01.657 --> 02:51:02.918]  We'll be back with more calls.
[02:51:02.918 --> 02:51:05.819]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[02:51:05.819 --> 02:51:09.341]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:51:09.341 --> 02:51:11.522]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[02:51:11.522 --> 02:51:12.923]  Protection from water main breaks.
[02:51:13.203 --> 02:51:20.805]  E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[02:51:20.805 --> 02:51:26.807]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.
[02:51:26.807 --> 02:51:32.789]  Tested by multiple independent NSF EPA certified labs, they are the gold standard in water purification.
[02:51:33.149 --> 02:51:37.991]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[02:51:37.991 --> 02:51:39.772]  That means big savings.
[02:51:39.772 --> 02:51:44.234]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[02:51:44.234 --> 02:51:47.436]  Get a Big Berkey today at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[02:52:03.976 --> 02:52:05.577]  Time and time again.
[02:52:05.577 --> 02:52:08.500]  You need to come here and help us.
[02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:09.961]  We need assistance.
[02:52:09.961 --> 02:52:10.762]  Please!
[02:52:10.762 --> 02:52:14.345]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[02:52:14.345 --> 02:52:18.048]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[02:52:18.048 --> 02:52:20.751]  While the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:52:20.751 --> 02:52:23.273]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[02:52:23.273 --> 02:52:26.856]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.
[02:52:27.156 --> 02:52:30.640]  We are hurting down here and we need help!
[02:52:49.539 --> 02:52:50.440]  Immediately!
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:55.207]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[02:52:55.207 --> 02:52:59.614]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com
[02:53:02.110 --> 02:53:05.631]  You've been hearing about the in-home freeze-dryer from Harvest Right for months now.
[02:53:05.631 --> 02:53:07.171]  Have you invested in yours yet?
[02:53:07.171 --> 02:53:09.751]  As you know, we live in a politically and economically troubled time.
[02:53:09.751 --> 02:53:13.232]  You should be preparing for an uncertain future today.
[02:53:13.232 --> 02:53:19.453]  Right now is the time to start freeze-drying your own food so you can become self-reliant and less dependent upon others.
[02:53:19.453 --> 02:53:23.534]  To invest in your own home freeze-dryer, go to HarvestRight.com.
[02:53:23.534 --> 02:53:25.254]  Hurry supplies are limited.
[02:53:25.254 --> 02:53:28.114]  Again, that's a home freeze-dryer from HarvestRight.com.
[02:53:28.114 --> 02:53:30.315]  And be sure to mention this ad to save $200 through the month of August.
[02:53:31.855 --> 02:53:37.177]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[02:53:37.177 --> 02:53:39.178]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[02:53:39.178 --> 02:53:42.960]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:47.142]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[02:53:47.142 --> 02:53:53.865]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[02:53:53.865 --> 02:53:57.727]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.
[02:53:57.727 --> 02:53:59.268]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.
[02:54:19.585 --> 02:54:22.867]  Well, Bill Bonner, the economist, was on earlier.
[02:54:22.867 --> 02:54:24.828]  He's got a new book coming out.
[02:54:24.828 --> 02:54:28.170]  It's Get Bill's Book, the number one dot com.
[02:54:28.170 --> 02:54:32.412]  And, again, it ties into everything that our guest is talking about.
[02:54:32.412 --> 02:54:34.234]  The book is Hormageddon.
[02:54:34.234 --> 02:54:36.755]  You can find it now, just now being offered.
[02:54:36.755 --> 02:54:37.475]  It's not even out yet.
[02:54:38.756 --> 02:54:42.217]  Yes, I heard something on YouTube about two days ago about the DTCC.
[02:55:07.177 --> 02:55:35.585]  SGT Report had a guest Bix Weir on and it's for those that don't know the DTCC manages the price of precious metals and it's time for you to make the call Alex there is there is a short time we have till August 14th before they shut the door on
[02:55:36.309 --> 02:55:39.612]  On the precious metal price.
[02:55:39.612 --> 02:55:43.075]  And, you know, I know there's a lot of precious metal manipulation going on.
[02:55:43.075 --> 02:55:45.857]  But, you know, I'm always seeing stuff out there on the web.
[02:55:45.857 --> 02:55:46.638]  Oh, this is eminent.
[02:55:46.638 --> 02:55:47.799]  That's eminent.
[02:55:47.799 --> 02:55:49.060]  I think metals have bottomed out.
[02:55:49.060 --> 02:55:50.101]  They might go down lower.
[02:55:50.101 --> 02:55:57.647]  But I mean, all I know is I have it as an emergency backup or emergency backup or for my boogie pack.
[02:55:57.647 --> 02:56:00.770]  Joel Skousen, your take on that?
[02:56:00.770 --> 02:56:03.071]  Almost never do any of those Internet
[02:56:04.697 --> 02:56:11.040]  Warnings or projections about a set date when a certain collapse of a market is going to happen ever come true.
[02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:15.162]  I'm always suspicious that these things are disinformation.
[02:56:15.162 --> 02:56:17.003]  Yes, I agree with you.
[02:56:17.003 --> 02:56:22.545]  Precious metals are being manipulated, but it's a very complex process.
[02:56:22.545 --> 02:56:29.609]  It's not from a single one organization, and I just don't think anything's coming down on the 14th.
[02:56:32.717 --> 02:56:33.117]  I hear you.
[02:56:33.117 --> 02:56:36.119]  I appreciate that call, caller, Michael.
[02:56:36.119 --> 02:56:39.721]  Let's go to Hologram Boy, who's calling in from Wisconsin.
[02:56:39.721 --> 02:56:40.341]  Thanks for calling.
[02:56:40.341 --> 02:56:42.022]  Go ahead.
[02:56:42.022 --> 02:56:42.443]  Hold on.
[02:56:42.443 --> 02:56:43.904]  Hold on.
[02:56:43.904 --> 02:56:45.264]  I got it.
[02:56:45.264 --> 02:56:45.484]  OK.
[02:56:45.484 --> 02:56:49.687]  Mr. Skelton, I have a question for you and a statement for Alex.
[02:56:49.687 --> 02:56:51.788]  Sorry, I'm in an attic.
[02:56:51.788 --> 02:56:52.589]  Hold on.
[02:56:52.589 --> 02:56:54.029]  I'm going to have to let you go, bro.
[02:56:54.029 --> 02:56:54.410]  I'm sorry.
[02:56:54.410 --> 02:56:56.131]  You got a phone problem there.
[02:56:56.131 --> 02:56:57.772]  John in California, you're on the air.
[02:56:57.772 --> 02:56:58.172]  Go ahead.
[02:56:58.172 --> 02:56:59.993]  Hello?
[02:57:00.424 --> 02:57:00.704]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:00.704 --> 02:57:01.184]  You're on the air.
[02:57:01.184 --> 02:57:01.825]  Go ahead.
[02:57:01.825 --> 02:57:02.565]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:57:02.565 --> 02:57:09.288]  I just wanted to say, you know, I was talking to my friend in the military, and she said, you know, they're giving them vaccines.
[02:57:09.288 --> 02:57:10.268]  They won't tell them what it is.
[02:57:10.268 --> 02:57:11.969]  And now nobody has a period there.
[02:57:11.969 --> 02:57:13.690]  There's nothing going on.
[02:57:13.690 --> 02:57:16.971]  It's like they just shut down their whole body system.
[02:57:16.971 --> 02:57:21.053]  And also, I wanted to ask Joel a question.
[02:57:21.053 --> 02:57:22.674]  What would you suggest to be prepared?
[02:57:24.316 --> 02:57:30.125]  I mean, I would buy his book, Strategic Relocation, and the film, because, I mean, this is stuff I'm into, so I got him to make the film, Joel.
[02:57:38.206 --> 02:57:40.850]  Well, you know, a lot of it depends on where you live.
[02:57:40.850 --> 02:57:45.978]  You know, if you're living in an unsafe environment, all of the preparations will only last you a certain amount of time.
[02:57:45.978 --> 02:57:49.804]  And that's why I think you've got to look at both those things.
[02:57:49.804 --> 02:57:53.489]  The physical preparedness inside the home, but where that home is, and ultimately,
[02:57:54.270 --> 02:58:02.175]  I believe because of the social unrest that's going to happen, everybody needs to have concealed, hardened safe rooms in a basement space.
[02:58:02.175 --> 02:58:06.038]  It's not that expensive to build, especially if you do it yourself.
[02:58:06.038 --> 02:58:13.223]  But you've got to be able to get out of the way of mobs of government searching for food supplies, stealing what you have.
[02:58:13.223 --> 02:58:16.805]  You've got to be able to hide and avoid confrontation.
[02:58:16.805 --> 02:58:19.447]  I think it's going to be essential someday to do that.
[02:58:19.447 --> 02:58:23.770]  And I cover that in my Secure Home book, as well as Strategic Relocation.
[02:58:25.370 --> 02:58:25.590]  All right.
[02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:26.731]  Great job, Joel Skousen.
[02:58:26.731 --> 02:58:30.051]  We'll be back, Lord willing, tonight, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[02:58:30.051 --> 02:58:31.392]  Sorry, the other callers.
[02:58:31.392 --> 02:58:33.072]  And, of course, back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:33.072 --> 02:58:33.512]  to 2 p.m.
[02:58:33.512 --> 02:58:38.073]  The Globalists are moving on all fronts, though, and they do not want this operation going forward.
[02:58:38.073 --> 02:58:41.254]  So pray for Infowars and everyone else telling the truth.
[02:58:41.254 --> 02:58:43.775]  Until tonight, 7 o'clock Central, God bless you all.
[02:58:43.775 --> 02:58:47.195]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:59:22.918 --> 02:59:26.579]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:59:26.579 --> 02:59:30.860]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:59:30.860 --> 02:59:32.640]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:59:32.640 --> 02:59:40.502]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:59:40.502 --> 02:59:41.643]  But for how long?
