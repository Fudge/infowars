[00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:06.228]  Because I feel like this all the time, trying to politically awaken people that they're being lied to, that there's an agenda.
[00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:20.320]  It's not left or right, it's, hey, there's mind control going on, the signal's broadcast 24 hours a day, through all this media, just become aware of it, and they'll say, there's nothing going on, and I want to say, put on these glasses, or start chewing concrete!
[00:00:25.774 --> 00:00:31.338]  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
[00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:34.060]  They have recruited the rich and the powerful!
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.742]  And they have blinded us to the truth!
[00:00:36.742 --> 00:00:39.744]  The question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[00:00:39.744 --> 00:00:42.746]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:45.648]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[00:00:45.648 --> 00:00:50.892]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[00:00:51.272 --> 00:00:57.875]  An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation.
[00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:07.979]  Outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us, from birth to death, are our owners!
[00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.902]  Latest census numbers prove the United States has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized countries today.
[00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:26.088]  Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
[00:01:26.088 --> 00:01:37.975]  The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
[00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:41.417]  For the first time in all of human history,
[00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.513]  Mankind is politically awakened.
[00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:49.155]  That's a total new reality.
[00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:52.018]  I've got one that can see.
[00:01:52.018 --> 00:01:54.500]  We can't be the only ones who can see.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:04.348]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got at the root of all our problems.
[00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:07.367]  It's a new morning in America.
[00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:08.287]  Fresh.
[00:02:08.287 --> 00:02:09.288]  Vital.
[00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:11.590]  The old cynicism is gone.
[00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.111]  We have faith in our leaders.
[00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:18.495]  We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
[00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:22.257]  It really boils down to our ability to accept.
[00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:24.119]  We don't need pessimism.
[00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.181]  I have two words for you.
[00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.242]  Predator drums.
[00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:33.786]  And who are you little guy?
[00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:36.468]  We will never see it coming.
[00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:44.860]  Don't forget, the first guy who uses a Second Amendment weapon to bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house is gonna be a folk hero in the spectrum.
[00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:52.808]  We broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[00:02:52.808 --> 00:02:59.111]  I'm just trying to warn you folks that television is a giant LED weapon system.
[00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:00.211]  It's so advanced.
[00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:02.832]  They got a monkey farm in Bastrop, folks.
[00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:06.994]  They do all sorts of testing on great apes, rhesus monkeys, the whole nine yards.
[00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:14.137]  And they go, oh, you didn't see this, and punch a button and it'd be hundreds of monkeys with wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing them.
[00:03:14.137 --> 00:03:16.138]  All I ever have to do is be famous.
[00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.691]  People watch me, and they love me.
[00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:22.612]  You can have a little taste of that good life, too.
[00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:23.833]  Now I know you want it.
[00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:25.714]  Hell, everybody does.
[00:03:25.714 --> 00:03:28.155]  Do it to your own kind.
[00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:29.676]  What's the threat?
[00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.457]  We all sell out every day.
[00:03:31.457 --> 00:03:33.278]  Might as well be on the winning team.
[00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:40.823]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:45.780]  And I'm all out of bubble gum.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.361]  Time to take a stand, boys.
[00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.042]  You know what?
[00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:50.723]  You got a little courage.
[00:03:50.723 --> 00:03:54.005]  Stand up for yourself.
[00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:56.626]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:03:56.626 --> 00:04:02.570]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.570]  It's Friday, folks.
[00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.173]  We're gonna give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat as well.
[00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:19.569]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be back live on this Friday edition.
[00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:30.853]  Dr. Nick Begich is going to be joining us on a host of issues, including brain chips for the troops, positronics, type warfare systems, and so much more.
[00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:33.514]  Also, a global warming scientist covered up a skeptic's
[00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:37.368]  damaging review.
[00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:43.934]  The paper echoes Climategate, showing the organized takeover and socialistic McCarthyism.
[00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:48.558]  It's all coming up on this live Friday edition.
[00:04:48.558 --> 00:04:52.501]  Massive transmission lined up for you today.
[00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.203]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:55.203 --> 00:04:55.644]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:06.754]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:05:06.754 --> 00:05:09.116]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:05:09.116 --> 00:05:14.378]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:19.561]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:22.582]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:26.945]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:31.267]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:41.493]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:44.015]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:05:44.215 --> 00:05:52.420]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.382]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:05:59.344 --> 00:06:01.965]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:04.567]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:10.730]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.813]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:20.715]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:06:20.715 --> 00:06:25.218]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:34.122]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:06:34.122 --> 00:06:36.263]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:47.448]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:54.851]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.

[00:07:00.612 --> 00:07:06.596]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball... Alert!
[00:07:06.596 --> 00:07:07.317]  Security!
[00:07:07.317 --> 00:07:07.837]  Alert!
[00:07:07.837 --> 00:07:09.879]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:10.780]  Analysis.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.520]  InfoWars.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.522]  Building independent media operations.
[00:07:13.522 --> 00:07:18.625]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:19.666]  Prime Directive.
[00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:21.247]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:07:21.247 --> 00:07:24.150]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.272]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:07:27.532 --> 00:07:31.316]  I don't know what he is except a conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:34.199]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:36.201]  They are never going to stop.
[00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:40.325]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:07:43.968 --> 00:07:47.371]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:48.391]  Imperative.
[00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:50.473]  Destroy Britain and its TV.
[00:07:50.473 --> 00:07:55.017]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:56.638]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:07:56.638 --> 00:07:58.719]  You can feel it.
[00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:00.861]  What's his name?
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.421]  There is a war.
[00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.303]  It's happening now.
[00:08:26.303 --> 00:08:28.665]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:31.247]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:08:31.247 --> 00:08:33.168]  We are the resistance.
[00:08:33.168 --> 00:08:34.810]  We are the Infowar.
[00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:44.410]  It is Friday, ladies and gentlemen, the 16th day already of May 2014.
[00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.891]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:52.532]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.052]  Wow!
[00:08:53.052 --> 00:08:55.892]  Again, incredible amounts of news.
[00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:57.493]  Here's the good news.
[00:08:57.493 --> 00:08:58.413]  We have power.
[00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:03.694]  We can force the illegitimate criminals that have hijacked the federal government to do the right thing.
[00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:10.649]  On aiding Al-Qaeda in Syria, on so many issues when we say no.
[00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:27.880]  And now it's being reported that Obama is eyeing executive action to stop deportations, the Associated Press is reporting, because of massive, massive, massive public anger.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.283]  The latest round is 36,000 illegals, aggravated felons,
[00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:34.743]  It's hundreds of thousands of illegals, period, being released.
[00:09:34.743 --> 00:09:37.051]  We're talking rapists, child molesters, you name it.
[00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:38.495]  It just shows the lawlessness.
[00:09:39.491 --> 00:09:47.916]  And now because there's been hearings in Congress, Obama's claiming he'll have some executive order to review it, so he can act like he's not part of it.
[00:09:47.916 --> 00:10:04.224]  President Barack Obama's new Homeland Security Secretary is offering his first public hints that executive action the administration might take on immigration, suggesting changes to a much-criticized program that runs the names of people booked for local crimes through a federal immigration database.
[00:10:04.224 --> 00:10:06.966]  So, they're also spinning it back like they won't
[00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:12.133]  Run people through a database, but that they will do something on the deportation.
[00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:13.755]  So a lot of spin.
[00:10:13.755 --> 00:10:18.603]  And again, that's whatever Obama does, they end up claiming they're going to do one thing and then doing another.
[00:10:18.603 --> 00:10:23.090]  But advocates who have pushed Obama for bold action with immigration legislation stalled in Congress.
[00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.753]  Wasted no time in declaring that such steps wouldn't go far enough.
[00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:43.784]  Homeland Security Secretary Jean Johnson, tasked by Obama with reviewing the nation's deportation policy to see whether it can be made more humane, said Thursday that the so-called Secure Communities Program needs a fresh start.
[00:10:44.324 --> 00:10:54.712]  The program allows immigration and customs enforcement officials to ask local police and sheriffs to detain people who have been booked and whose fingerprints match in a federal database for immigration violations.
[00:10:54.712 --> 00:10:56.333]  Let me explain something.
[00:10:56.333 --> 00:11:03.338]  So I started that out by saying, hey, it's a good thing they're having to talk about not, you know, just deporting all these felons.
[00:11:03.338 --> 00:11:07.901]  But then they spin it back and say, but we won't even run it through the database.
[00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:10.403]  So again, it's just it's total spin.
[00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.425]  ICE can then decide whether to deport them.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:21.966]  That's led to complaints that people are being deported for immigration violations without being convicted of any crime other than minor offenses.
[00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:23.467]  I thought you're here illegally.
[00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:33.133]  Police and sheriff's officials also complained that people are afraid to interact with law enforcement because they worry they'll be deported following recent court rulings that raised questions about the program.
[00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:38.237]  Local governments increasingly have announced plans to refuse to honor the detention request.
[00:11:38.237 --> 00:11:39.978]  So the illegals are being legalized by fiat.
[00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:54.014]  In comments Thursday on PBS NewsHour program, Johnson indicated he might aim to revamp the program to focus on people who actually have been convicted, not just those arrested or booked for aggravated felonies.
[00:11:54.014 --> 00:12:03.781]  In my judgment, secure communities should be an efficient way to work with state and local enforcement and reach removal priorities that have those are convicted of something.
[00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:18.674]  And it just goes on, and there's a mention in the news of, you know, oh, but we won't again deport people that are already felons, or that we will start deporting them and then won't release them, to be clear.
[00:12:18.674 --> 00:12:21.617]  You start getting into all their spin, it gets confusing.
[00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:29.244]  But they're saying, basically, that they will look
[00:12:30.425 --> 00:12:32.688]  It's just lies within lies.
[00:12:32.688 --> 00:12:34.550]  The lies are so incredible I get confused.
[00:12:49.295 --> 00:12:53.399]  When I was just reading over that and breaking some of that down.
[00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:59.145]  Absolutely mind-boggling to see that unfolding.
[00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:05.191]  But global warming scientists cover up skeptics' damaging review.
[00:13:05.191 --> 00:13:06.072]  Paper.
[00:13:06.072 --> 00:13:07.553]  Echoes of Climategate.
[00:13:08.274 --> 00:13:10.277]  Climate McCarthyism.
[00:13:10.277 --> 00:13:16.104]  That's out of the Times of London and the Daily Mail as well as Breitbart.
[00:13:16.104 --> 00:13:17.906]  DC underwater.
[00:13:17.906 --> 00:13:19.648]  Not if, but when.
[00:13:19.648 --> 00:13:22.572]  Meanwhile, there's snowfall in Chicago.
[00:13:22.572 --> 00:13:27.498]  Those are the stories up on DrudgeReport.com in the left-hand corner, breaking that down.
[00:13:29.218 --> 00:13:30.459]  It's a total hoax.
[00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:38.604]  The Antarctic and Arctic are getting bigger than they have in the history of satellites since the 1960s, showing what's happening.
[00:13:38.604 --> 00:13:52.453]  But every summer, they show the satellite feed of it beginning to melt, expand and contract, expand in the winter, contract in the summer, and they say, look, within a few decades it'll totally melt, we'll all be dead.
[00:13:52.453 --> 00:13:54.254]  Al Gore said back in what, 2003, that by 2013, the entire
[00:13:58.849 --> 00:14:02.052]  Arctic would be melted in summer.
[00:14:02.052 --> 00:14:03.192]  And in winter.
[00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:04.874]  And it's record size.
[00:14:04.874 --> 00:14:05.354]  Doesn't matter.
[00:14:05.354 --> 00:14:20.186]  NASA came out, one of their scientists this week, we wrote about it at Infowars.com, and said that the entire section, looks like up to a thirds of Antarctica, down at the bottom, would be melted.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.462]  And it doesn't matter when it doesn't come true.
[00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:25.043]  It's the fear-mongering.
[00:14:25.043 --> 00:14:27.565]  And here's the Times of London today.
[00:14:27.565 --> 00:14:32.248]  Scientists in cover-up of damaging climate review.
[00:14:32.248 --> 00:14:37.472]  Research which heaped doubt on the rate of global warming was deliberately suppressed.
[00:14:37.472 --> 00:14:39.513]  Let's get Lord Monckton on next week.
[00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:41.055]  By scientists, maybe even this Sunday.
[00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:47.816]  Because it was less than helpful to their cause, it was claimed last night.
[00:14:47.816 --> 00:15:02.081]  In an echo of the infamous Climategate scandal at the University of East Anglia that helped coordinate the fraud worldwide with the UN and other universities, one of the world's top academic journals rejected the work of five experts after a reviewer privately denounced it as harmful.
[00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:07.269]  The bullying of climate science skeptics must end.
[00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:13.374]  When did demonstrating and demonizing your opponents become so acceptable?
[00:15:13.374 --> 00:15:15.576]  The article goes on to break down.
[00:15:15.576 --> 00:15:19.960]  We also have it up at Infowars.com.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:29.068]  And the full article breaks down how they then, even in some cases, got people to lose their jobs in the U.S.
[00:15:29.068 --> 00:15:29.969]  and England.
[00:15:29.969 --> 00:15:30.729]  This is what happens.
[00:15:32.318 --> 00:15:36.421]  You've got a hit show on the Cooking Channel.
[00:15:36.421 --> 00:15:39.284]  You're two Christian brothers.
[00:15:39.284 --> 00:15:43.587]  Your show's not even about Christianity, but it's discovered that you're secretly Christian.
[00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:47.250]  You're fired from your hit show.
[00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:52.174]  I mean, this is literally the Christians having to go back underground like in Rome.
[00:15:53.803 --> 00:16:00.671]  In the catacombs or something, I mean, that's the level of hardcore authoritarianism we're seeing.
[00:16:00.671 --> 00:16:05.336]  This is the kind of stuff you have in China against the Buddhist Falun Gong.
[00:16:05.336 --> 00:16:06.277]  They're like Buddhist-like.
[00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:07.159]  They're not even Buddhist.
[00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:11.884]  They follow Buddhist meditation for exercise.
[00:16:11.884 --> 00:16:13.226]  But because they are
[00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:26.846]  Unworldly people, they tend to be more moral, and the Chinese Communist government hunts them down, puts them in facilities, tests their DNA and blood, and then harvests their organs at leisure.
[00:16:26.846 --> 00:16:28.088]  That is the incredible evil.
[00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:29.149]  And speaking of the censorship...
[00:16:29.994 --> 00:16:32.395]  Dinesh D'Souza's trial is coming up.
[00:16:32.395 --> 00:16:35.597]  He's still trying to make his movie and release it by July 4th.
[00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:39.898]  President Obama's half-brother backs out of interview with Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:44.461]  He'd already done the interview for the new film, but somehow was backed out of it.
[00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:52.004]  Mark Obama, whose political world differs from that of the president, was to appear in the conservative filmmaker's upcoming movie, America.
[00:16:56.024 --> 00:17:02.331]  And I'd rather you'd already interviewed him, but I guess he had a more expansive interview set up, because Sousa thought that he had the blockbuster interview set up with Mark.
[00:17:03.453 --> 00:17:18.424]  Obama that was to appear in his upcoming film, America, but President Obama's half-brother has pulled out following the conservative filmmaker's federal indictment on charges that he violated campaign finance laws, getting friends to give money to his friend who was running for the Senate.
[00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:20.585]  I mean, I thought that's what politics is.
[00:17:20.585 --> 00:17:23.207]  No, you're not allowed to give money to the Tea Party.
[00:17:23.207 --> 00:17:25.249]  You're not allowed to be a Christian or pro-life.
[00:17:25.249 --> 00:17:26.329]  You're not allowed to be a
[00:17:27.893 --> 00:17:36.622]  Anthropogenic global warming skeptic, because we live in a liberal country where we arrest you!
[00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:40.806]  And the FCC wants to take over the internet?
[00:17:40.806 --> 00:17:45.951]  And they want to bring in taxation, regulation, and inspectors in newsrooms that don't even broadcast?
[00:17:47.639 --> 00:17:49.720]  This is all classical tyranny!
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.940]  Of course it is!
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:18:10.208]  Because when they get this all done, they're going to devalue the dollar, and take your pension funds, and take your bank accounts, just like in Europe, just like in Iceland, just like in Greece, just like in other areas, Cyprus, and if you don't like it, all the paramilitary police have been trained, you're a terrorist!
[00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:20.217]  So we better have a public debate about all this and force this out into the open now.
[00:18:20.217 --> 00:18:24.120]  We better have a public debate about it because they don't want to have a debate.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:24.861]  And why is that?
[00:18:24.861 --> 00:18:34.328]  Because if there is a debate, we'll have the moral high ground, the people will become politically awake and aware, and then this nightmare won't unfold.
[00:18:34.328 --> 00:18:37.170]  I'm going to have this added to the excellent long article
[00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:54.578]  Written by Mikhail Thelin, the articles done by Watson earlier this year concerning Virginia, where our reporters were yesterday and where they were arrested for three hours, almost three hours, for daring to go on the base to ask to talk to the public information officer.
[00:18:54.578 --> 00:18:59.361]  This dovetails, leaked documents reveal Marine Corps Urban Training Center
[00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:01.795]  Based on U.S.
[00:19:01.795 --> 00:19:05.497]  town and that the training is for the American people.
[00:19:05.497 --> 00:19:14.944]  Whistleblower says facility with Baptist churches, farmhouses used to train foreign and domestic groups to take on the American people.
[00:19:14.944 --> 00:19:16.925]  Now, Mikel Thalum is a great writer.
[00:19:16.925 --> 00:19:19.587]  He gets a lot of documents because he goes through our email.
[00:19:19.587 --> 00:19:20.908]  He has access, obviously, to it.
[00:19:20.908 --> 00:19:22.088]  One of our newest writers.
[00:19:22.088 --> 00:19:24.230]  Been writing for us for a year, working for us about six months.
[00:19:25.489 --> 00:19:32.720]  And it's an excellent article, but I want him to add the clergy response team video on YouTube to show folks that this is going on, the preachers of spies.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:40.492]  And I want him to add where the army admits they're trying to take on the American people.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:55.378]  And I want him to add our latest article dealing with all this, but here's the Marine Corps document admitting it's for America and they're training to fight their new enemy, farmers and ranchers.
[00:19:55.378 --> 00:19:59.324]  The rural community is who they're going to finally mop up during the Civil War.
[00:20:00.393 --> 00:20:05.675]  Gentlemen, in search of a million-dollar smile that'll make them take notice, I mean really get their attention?

[00:22:01.713 --> 00:22:06.817]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:22:06.817 --> 00:22:14.963]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:22:14.963 --> 00:22:19.467]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.

[00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:26.421]  I saw Sheriff John Brown.
[00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:37.144]  But I did it in self-defense.
[00:24:37.144 --> 00:24:38.764]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:24:38.764 --> 00:24:44.926]  Dr. Nick Beggins is joining us on a host of issues in the second hour.
[00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:46.286]  We will have open phones.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.624]  Coming up during the portion of this hour and into the third hour today.
[00:24:53.624 --> 00:25:03.772]  But here's this latest article that I'm going to be covering in more detail this Sunday with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and David Knight in studio to not just talk about what happened to them in Virginia going to Fort A.P.
[00:25:03.772 --> 00:25:16.201]  Hill and getting arrested, but that the federal government run by the globalists is openly training under NLEO 9 14 different foreign nations to invade and occupy the U.S.
[00:25:17.455 --> 00:25:20.877]  So I'm going to have NLE09 added to this latest article as well.
[00:25:20.877 --> 00:25:32.782]  Because what Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com do that other news organizations don't is I don't like articles just on one subject.
[00:25:32.782 --> 00:25:39.605]  I like articles that by the bottom tie it together with the larger image of what's going on.
[00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:44.227]  And it's sensational that we've gotten these secret Marine Corps documents confirmed
[00:25:45.285 --> 00:25:48.627]  That they're training to take on basically everybody's granddaddy.
[00:25:48.627 --> 00:25:51.909]  Anybody who's independent in a rural area.
[00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:58.932]  Globalist always or any takeover group takes over the cities first, then the suburbs, then the small towns, then the rural areas.
[00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:02.594]  And they fan out to subdue and dominate.
[00:26:02.594 --> 00:26:05.396]  And the entire Pentagon program, the
[00:26:07.017 --> 00:26:20.800]  Emergency Centers Establishment Act, the Rural Affairs Commission, that is under the Pentagon and Homeland Security, is putting plainclothes troops in every town and city, literally spying on people.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.701]  And then bringing in a GEN21 federal money to buy off the town leadership.
[00:26:26.701 --> 00:26:33.503]  And they are training to take on small towns everywhere because they know when they order the gun confiscation, when they order the 80% taxation,
[00:26:36.138 --> 00:26:40.619]  When they order this, they're going to take over the town centers and control the roads.
[00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:44.441]  And that is what is in all of the public documents.
[00:26:44.441 --> 00:26:48.022]  So, so much of this is public, but they don't want us on these bases.
[00:26:48.022 --> 00:26:52.964]  They don't want us talking to the Marines, because they don't want public awareness to then have a discussion.
[00:26:52.964 --> 00:26:58.986]  They want an Army Times, Stars and Stripes, going, yeah, the Army's training to take on domestic groups.
[00:26:58.986 --> 00:27:00.846]  They think the Tea Party's the main enemy now.
[00:27:00.846 --> 00:27:01.406]  It's good.
[00:27:01.406 --> 00:27:02.627]  Or to have the
[00:27:04.226 --> 00:27:06.308]  You know, C-SPAN have a general on to talk about it.
[00:27:06.308 --> 00:27:12.433]  So, so, at one level they admit it to soften us up and get us ready, and so the troops all hear it and go, well, it must be okay.
[00:27:12.433 --> 00:27:16.556]  I mean, you know, it's in Stars and Stripes, it's in the Army Times.
[00:27:16.556 --> 00:27:26.824]  But for the general public, oh, there's no militarization of police, there's no armored vehicles getting deployed to every town, there's no weapons caches and helicopters getting put in.
[00:27:26.824 --> 00:27:27.505]  Oh, no.
[00:27:27.505 --> 00:27:32.829]  We're like, oh, here's an official Homeland Security document saying it's gun owners returning veterans and Christians of the main enemy.
[00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:37.054]  And at first they said, oh, that document's not real.
[00:27:37.054 --> 00:27:39.339]  And later they went, no, it's real.
[00:27:39.339 --> 00:27:40.581]  And you watch.
[00:27:40.581 --> 00:27:43.848]  It is going to be gun owners and rural groups and veterans.
[00:27:43.848 --> 00:27:45.171]  They are the terrorists.
[00:27:47.242 --> 00:27:51.743]  So this is the giant build-up for war with the American people.
[00:27:51.743 --> 00:27:55.464]  Leaked documents reveal Marine Corps Urban Training Center based on U.S.
[00:27:55.464 --> 00:27:56.504]  town.
[00:27:56.504 --> 00:28:02.585]  Whistleblower says facility with Baptist Church farmhouses used to train foreign and domestic groups.
[00:28:02.585 --> 00:28:10.407]  Newly leaked Marine Corps documents detail yet another military urban training center that more closely resembles a small U.S.
[00:28:10.407 --> 00:28:13.607]  town than a foreign combat zone.
[00:28:13.607 --> 00:28:16.808]  And again, when they admit NORTHCOM is for the American people,
[00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:23.532]  Folks, okay, it's in the document, big deal, but when you see the town, it brings it home.
[00:28:23.532 --> 00:28:34.337]  The document, entitled, Military Operations on Urban Terrain Collective Training Facility, details the specifics of a mock 30-acre town located at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
[00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:43.402]  Originally built in 1990, new additions to the facility include Baptist Church, a police station, several farmhouses, have transformed the layout of the once international town.
[00:28:43.982 --> 00:28:45.823]  Yeah, part of it looks European.
[00:28:45.823 --> 00:28:49.385]  According to the military whistleblower provided the documents to InfoWars, U.S.
[00:28:49.385 --> 00:28:54.587]  Marines at the facility have been tasked with training soldiers, law enforcement agencies, and homeland security.
[00:28:54.587 --> 00:29:02.211]  Yeah, look, they're all buying weapons and bullets and training for us in skills such as fighting in wooded areas, urban patrolling,
[00:29:02.811 --> 00:29:05.312]  Forcible entry and night fighting techniques.
[00:29:05.312 --> 00:29:10.354]  The facility is also being used to cross-train foreign troops from the United Nations.
[00:29:10.354 --> 00:29:16.897]  By the way, folks, if this all goes down, you don't go out and night fight the Marines.
[00:29:16.897 --> 00:29:22.260]  The veterans are going to go find you at your houses and in the bars and on the streets.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.381]  They're going to see your tattoo in a store and they're going to follow you outside.
[00:29:25.381 --> 00:29:26.602]  You understand that?
[00:29:27.782 --> 00:29:38.265]  So, part of this is a narrative where they're training like we're going to have the British and the Bluecoats march into each other and fix bayonets and shoot each other.
[00:29:38.265 --> 00:29:42.107]  That went out in the days when George Washington got rid of it.
[00:29:42.107 --> 00:29:42.827]  You understand that?
[00:29:42.827 --> 00:29:48.328]  If it goes to a civil war, it's going to be fought on the streets and in your houses.
[00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:49.209]  We're going to come for you.
[00:29:49.209 --> 00:29:50.569]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.569 --> 00:29:53.090]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.771]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:08.937]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:30:08.937 --> 00:30:17.343]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:30:17.343 --> 00:30:22.226]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:30:22.226 --> 00:30:28.611]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:29.011 --> 00:30:36.178]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:30:36.178 --> 00:30:43.204]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:30:43.204 --> 00:30:47.548]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:30:47.688 --> 00:30:51.071]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:52.953]  You will be supporting a free press.
[00:30:52.953 --> 00:30:57.377]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:30:57.377 --> 00:30:59.259]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:59.259 --> 00:31:04.044]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:31:04.044 --> 00:31:08.148]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:12.050]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:15.092]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:31:15.092 --> 00:31:22.657]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:31:22.657 --> 00:31:26.299]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:31:26.579 --> 00:31:31.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.962]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:31:36.962 --> 00:31:40.882]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:31:40.882 --> 00:31:43.643]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:31:43.643 --> 00:31:45.143]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:31:45.143 --> 00:31:46.504]  It's time to take action.
[00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:48.324]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:31:59.908 --> 00:32:07.072]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:32:07.072 --> 00:32:09.413]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:32:09.413 --> 00:32:14.696]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:32:14.696 --> 00:32:19.638]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:32:19.858 --> 00:32:23.181]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:32:23.181 --> 00:32:27.265]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:32:27.265 --> 00:32:31.590]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:41.819]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:32:41.819 --> 00:32:44.342]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:32:44.502 --> 00:32:45.682]  He's going the distance.
[00:32:45.682 --> 00:32:46.463]  He's going for speed.
[00:32:46.463 --> 00:32:47.163]  She's all alone.
[00:32:47.163 --> 00:32:47.443]  All alone!
[00:32:47.443 --> 00:32:48.123]  All alone in a time of need.
[00:32:48.123 --> 00:32:49.364]  Because he's racing and racing and
[00:33:18.428 --> 00:33:24.574]  Look, there's so much news going on, but I want to ask listeners.
[00:33:24.574 --> 00:33:30.759]  I want to ask you, how do we crash through the lies and disinformation?
[00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:33.902]  How do we show people the bottom's already fallen out?
[00:33:33.902 --> 00:33:34.823]  The system is just...
[00:33:36.129 --> 00:33:38.350]  Shutting up open tyranny everywhere.
[00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.572]  We have to expose it and call it out.
[00:33:41.572 --> 00:33:43.093]  And the public's waking up.
[00:33:43.093 --> 00:33:44.414]  And the military's waking up.
[00:33:44.414 --> 00:33:49.057]  And most police I talk to are waking up and know that things are going in a very dangerous direction.
[00:33:50.503 --> 00:33:54.625]  But are we going to wait until the globalists stage a terror attack and blame it on domestic groups?
[00:33:54.625 --> 00:34:15.878]  I don't want a civil war in this country, but we the people, not Alex Jones, but we the people, if attacked by the globalists, if a total authoritarian system unfolds, and they try to arrest anybody that doesn't believe in man-made global warming, or arrest anybody that doesn't want their kids taught how to be sexualized,
[00:34:16.298 --> 00:34:22.020]  Or anybody who doesn't want to be inoculated, or anybody that doesn't want their 11-year-old daughter taken away to have an abortion.
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.801]  It's going to cause a civil war because the globalists want that civil war.
[00:34:25.801 --> 00:34:43.547]  I'm trying to avert that by exposing that the Army and the Marines and the National Guard are training to cordon cities, are training to confiscate guns, are training to arrest political dissidents, are training for a takeover, and admitting that their new enemy is an al-Qaeda
[00:34:44.167 --> 00:34:47.788]  That the corrupt federal government openly funds and runs.
[00:34:47.788 --> 00:34:49.509]  That's mainstream news now.
[00:34:49.509 --> 00:34:53.210]  I can't even believe that's mainstream news.
[00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:54.771]  They're now flipping it on to us.
[00:34:54.771 --> 00:34:59.753]  And I know I harp on this because it's happening.
[00:34:59.753 --> 00:35:02.113]  And if we expose it, it can be stopped.
[00:35:02.113 --> 00:35:06.875]  If we don't, they're going to bring it in and drop the hammer.
[00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:12.237]  I mean, my gosh, look at the cover of Drudge Report showing an illegal MS-13 person with a giant
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:23.904]  Tattoo of Obama legalizing the illegals on his stomach.
[00:35:23.904 --> 00:35:26.705]  I mean, that is the type of stuff we're dealing with.
[00:35:26.705 --> 00:35:32.708]  Just a government totally mafioso, totally and completely lawless.
[00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:38.691]  And now Obama says he's looking at executive action to stop deportations.
[00:35:38.691 --> 00:35:43.033]  And when I read that, because I'd heard he might, you know, stop the deportations.
[00:35:44.482 --> 00:35:51.225]  Because it makes him look so bad to be, you know, sending back little kids or something.
[00:35:51.225 --> 00:35:57.008]  But no, he's going to stop it for felons, for everybody, and has been stopping it.
[00:35:57.008 --> 00:36:08.774]  And it just shows how, whether you're white, black, Hispanic, whatever you are, if you're a good person, if you care about freedom, if you care about liberty, you are being targeted, you are being demonized.
[00:36:08.774 --> 00:36:13.556]  But if you're a felon, an aggravated felon, a bank robber, a child molester, you're legalized.
[00:36:14.798 --> 00:36:19.482]  By Obama.
[00:36:19.482 --> 00:36:28.610]  Now, I want to open the phones up and get your take just on the general corruption that we're seeing that's unfolding.
[00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.793]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:36:31.793 --> 00:36:31.833]  800-259-9231.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:42.096]  Again, 800-259-9231.
[00:36:42.096 --> 00:36:57.006]  And you've got the persecution of scientists getting fired, getting censored, who put out scientific reports that man-made global warming's a fraud, that the Earth's cooling.
[00:36:57.006 --> 00:37:02.250]  Or if you are Dinesh D'Souza and you make a film about Obama, you get arrested.
[00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.613]  I mean, or you're Pop-Tart, you eat it.
[00:37:07.535 --> 00:37:10.197]  Half of it, it looks like a gun, so the police are called.
[00:37:10.197 --> 00:37:12.419]  I mean, this is crazy level corruption.
[00:37:12.419 --> 00:37:14.961]  Where aggravated felon child rapists are released.
[00:37:14.961 --> 00:37:16.642]  Where bank robbers are released.
[00:37:16.642 --> 00:37:22.927]  But your child is suspended because people saw a gun in the Pop-Tart.
[00:37:22.927 --> 00:37:27.311]  It's like seeing a cloud above your house that looks like a gun, or a giraffe, and the police come.
[00:37:29.156 --> 00:37:36.098]  And look, they had troops in Latin America 50 years ago that wore masks and all the rest of it to terrorize people.
[00:37:36.098 --> 00:37:44.801]  And I saw a police chief in Baltimore a decade ago admit they wear these black uniforms and black masks to intimidate.
[00:37:44.801 --> 00:37:56.465]  And now there's a Daily Mail article, Rio Boco Cop Armed and Ready for the World Cup Elite Troops Carrying Rifles, Stun Grenades and Combat Knife Will Tackle Any Fan Who Causes Trouble.
[00:37:57.481 --> 00:38:06.527]  See, now it's for the general public.
[00:38:06.527 --> 00:38:14.451]  And if you look at the article by Paul Joseph Watson, Rio Robocops resemble police from dystopian classic Brazil.
[00:38:14.451 --> 00:38:20.775]  It shows the exact uniforms of the dystopic secret police versus what they're now wearing.
[00:38:20.775 --> 00:38:24.197]  Well, that's because the Soviet Union, they wore stuff like that.
[00:38:24.197 --> 00:38:25.878]  In fact, if you play the intro to Brazil,
[00:38:28.294 --> 00:38:32.656]  Or it's close to the start where they cut a hole in the roof, come in, rendition the dad.
[00:38:32.656 --> 00:38:34.716]  We should make an intro promo with that.
[00:38:34.716 --> 00:38:38.678]  And then cut it back and forth with what's happening in modern times.
[00:38:38.678 --> 00:38:41.419]  And other dystopic films.
[00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.580]  What's that Robert De Niro one?
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.201]  The Handmaiden's Bride or something like that?
[00:38:46.201 --> 00:38:52.103]  Where it's a dystopic future and they have public executions and black uniforms and all seeing eye on television.
[00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:58.155]  We should have a video where we illustrate how it was dystopic then.
[00:38:58.155 --> 00:39:00.338]  In the past this was seen as evil.
[00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:02.220]  North Korea was seen as evil.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.682]  Now it's the new good.
[00:39:05.745 --> 00:39:17.432]  But this article goes on and on with these secret documents dealing with the Marine Corps training base and the information that was sent to us where they train to take on the American people.
[00:39:17.432 --> 00:39:26.437]  And the preachers get on big power trips, a lot of them, to get approached by the FBI and by the CIA and to sign up to be part of the new brigades.
[00:39:27.574 --> 00:39:33.876]  You know, to take on the American people, and you know there are domestic groups and they gotta be dealt with.
[00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:39.257]  This is just so unspeakable, but it's actually happening.
[00:39:39.257 --> 00:39:42.658]  Then we've got some video of this, and audio we're gonna get to later.
[00:39:42.658 --> 00:39:44.839]  The day the ground erupted.
[00:39:44.839 --> 00:39:55.162]  Shocking moment, Syrian rebels blow up army camp with 60 tons of explosives after digging tunnel under the base using tactic pioneered in World War I.
[00:39:56.894 --> 00:40:09.938]  So that's what the CIA and NATO is training them to do, is dig 500 plus yard tunnels under Army bases and blowing everyone up inside.
[00:40:09.938 --> 00:40:11.299]  In the three plus year,
[00:40:12.503 --> 00:40:19.749]  Al Qaeda proxy war that America is openly running and funding.
[00:40:19.749 --> 00:40:27.195]  Simply amazing to see the video and the photo of that happening.
[00:40:27.195 --> 00:40:27.956]  There it is.
[00:40:27.956 --> 00:40:29.257]  Boom!
[00:40:29.257 --> 00:40:32.320]  Listeners have got to go up to Infowars.com.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.042]  You can see that.
[00:40:35.042 --> 00:40:40.807]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get into something I told you about
[00:40:42.236 --> 00:40:42.536]  I don't know.
[00:40:42.536 --> 00:40:44.378]  We had Derry Brownfield on the show many times.
[00:40:44.378 --> 00:40:45.839]  He died, what was it, last year?
[00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:46.840]  Was it two years ago now?
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.940]  Time really moves fast.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:54.485]  But he was a long-time big cattleman up in Missouri and had a big syndicated radio show, one of the first in the country.
[00:40:54.485 --> 00:41:00.050]  Even back before they really had talk radio, he did the Farm and Ranch Report and would talk about what was happening.
[00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:08.036]  And he pointed out that you have record beef prices in the last decade, but record bankruptcy for cattle ranchers.
[00:41:09.292 --> 00:41:19.339]  And almost everyone I know is getting out of cattle ranching because they've changed the tax rules, gotten rid of write-offs, where you cannot make a living doing it.
[00:41:19.339 --> 00:41:30.426]  Everyone I pretty much know who's a small-time rancher with 20 head, 100 head, 200 head, more of a hobby rancher, they do it because you get a little tax write-off on your property.
[00:41:30.426 --> 00:41:36.390]  Because if you don't have cattle on your property, you can't pay the property tax.
[00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:37.911]  Let's say you put beehives on it.
[00:41:39.767 --> 00:41:43.171]  And then you sell it to a local honey gatherer.
[00:41:43.171 --> 00:41:47.556]  Let's say you got 100 boxes on your property.
[00:41:47.556 --> 00:41:51.981]  You might get $3,000 or $4,000 in a year.
[00:41:51.981 --> 00:41:53.482]  If you're lucky.
[00:41:53.482 --> 00:41:56.926]  But you gotta give medicine to the bees, you gotta check them.
[00:41:56.926 --> 00:41:58.308]  It's a lot of work, and you get $3,000 or $4,000.
[00:42:01.653 --> 00:42:03.754]  And then let's say you got 100 head of cattle.
[00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:09.495]  You gotta keep the fences up, they get out sometimes, you gotta give them the vaccinations, veterinary bills, all of it.
[00:42:09.495 --> 00:42:17.318]  All that does is let you keep your 500 acres it takes to have 100 cows, depending on the type of grassland.
[00:42:17.318 --> 00:42:20.779]  Then you still gotta feed them during the winter.
[00:42:20.779 --> 00:42:29.182]  And then maybe you sell, you know, 10, 15, 20 cows a year, and let's say you sell them for $1,000 a piece or whatever,
[00:42:31.397 --> 00:42:37.500]  They then get sold off and there's no more what you'd call real cattle auctions.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.501]  There's no real cattle market.
[00:42:39.501 --> 00:42:49.506]  So the big distributors get them, they send them to meatpacking plants, they shut down all the little meatpacking plants, they jack up the prices super high on the consumer.
[00:42:49.506 --> 00:42:56.430]  So you're paying 30 bucks for a ribeye at a decent steakhouse.
[00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.891]  40, 50 bucks at a fancy one.
[00:42:59.172 --> 00:43:04.495]  You go to the discount places, 20 bucks for a thinner ribeye.
[00:43:04.495 --> 00:43:09.058]  That ribeye at that steakhouse just 10 years ago was $10.
[00:43:09.058 --> 00:43:09.438]  It's now 20.
[00:43:09.438 --> 00:43:17.203]  The fancy steakhouse, I remember at a steakhouse just 10 years ago thinking a $25 steak was too much.
[00:43:17.203 --> 00:43:22.346]  Nothing's $25 at a nice steakhouse now.
[00:43:22.346 --> 00:43:24.107]  You go to some steakhouses, it's $75.
[00:43:26.786 --> 00:43:28.708]  For a prime cut.
[00:43:28.708 --> 00:43:29.949]  Sorry, my mouth is starting to water here.
[00:43:29.949 --> 00:43:31.912]  Excuse me.
[00:43:31.912 --> 00:43:41.342]  I remember 10 years ago, I could take the family and get a Chateau Brion, which is basically like a big long cut of filet mignon, five or six cuts.
[00:43:41.342 --> 00:43:41.582]  It'd be $75, $50.
[00:43:45.171 --> 00:43:46.352]  Now it's $150.
[00:43:46.352 --> 00:43:50.054]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me explain the New World Order.
[00:43:50.054 --> 00:43:51.636]  It's a perfect illustration.
[00:43:51.636 --> 00:43:57.800]  The cattle ranchers go bankrupt because the economy is rigged and actuaried where you can't make it.
[00:43:59.386 --> 00:44:04.790]  My dad got word five years ago, we're getting rid of hobby farming and ranching right off.
[00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:07.633]  We don't care if it's still on the books as a law.
[00:44:07.633 --> 00:44:17.541]  You can't do that, the IRS sent him letters and he went to his accountant, or we're going to retroactively charge you all this money with penalty and interest.
[00:44:17.541 --> 00:44:25.767]  And my dad looked at the books and said, but if I stop cattle ranching, then we can't pay the property taxes.
[00:44:25.767 --> 00:44:27.689]  So he continues to cattle ranch,
[00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:33.153]  I guess about a hundred head with my uncle.
[00:44:33.153 --> 00:44:45.062]  Even though it loses money coming and going, he loses less money than he would if he quit.
[00:44:45.062 --> 00:44:46.463]  Let me explain that again.
[00:44:46.463 --> 00:44:52.748]  My father doesn't want to sell the land that we have left
[00:44:54.377 --> 00:44:57.670]  That goes back to Spanish land grants, Mexican land grants, 1829.
[00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:59.879]  The property is a liability.
[00:45:02.335 --> 00:45:08.159]  The government knows that and has set things to where most people won't keep it.
[00:45:08.159 --> 00:45:16.666]  My dad is a medical manager and a dentist who worked very hard and he subsidizes keeping family property just because we don't own it.
[00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:18.787]  The government owns it with those taxes.
[00:45:18.787 --> 00:45:20.448]  The power to tax, the power to destroy.
[00:45:20.448 --> 00:45:22.450]  So here's the article on the Economic Collapse blog.
[00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.912]  It links through to all the mainstream
[00:45:26.107 --> 00:45:34.532]  News articles out of the USDA, the US Drought Monitor, Scientific American, Associated Press, you name it.
[00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:37.013]  Totally bibliographed.
[00:45:37.013 --> 00:45:38.534]  The meat crisis is here!
[00:45:38.534 --> 00:45:41.936]  Price of shrimp up 61%.
[00:45:41.936 --> 00:45:44.358]  Beef at all-time high.
[00:45:44.358 --> 00:45:46.659]  Pork exploding to all-time high.
[00:45:46.659 --> 00:45:50.321]  Bloomberg reports as well.
[00:45:50.321 --> 00:45:51.882]  Stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:45:53.305 --> 00:45:54.765]  And the media will say it's a drought.
[00:45:54.765 --> 00:45:56.246]  That's only a small part of it.
[00:45:56.246 --> 00:46:00.687]  In California, that's what's hitting a lot of the vegetables.
[00:46:00.687 --> 00:46:06.629]  It's that people are getting out of it everywhere, and now they're shipping beef in, but you would think that would drive down prices.
[00:46:06.629 --> 00:46:07.089]  No.
[00:46:07.089 --> 00:46:08.709]  The packers all work together.
[00:46:08.709 --> 00:46:11.270]  There's only five or six big companies.
[00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:13.130]  Last time I checked, it's probably less now.
[00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:17.532]  And they all throttle it and control it to keep the prices as high as possible.
[00:46:19.929 --> 00:46:28.654]  The article goes on, and Bloomberg goes on to say, it will now be a luxury to even have a pork chop.
[00:46:28.654 --> 00:46:30.315]  That's social engineering.
[00:46:30.315 --> 00:46:31.456]  That's the New World Order.
[00:46:31.456 --> 00:46:33.017]  That's artificial scarcity.
[00:46:33.017 --> 00:46:37.720]  You want it, you got it, you live under it.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.681]  Go read the article.
[00:46:39.681 --> 00:46:48.106]  And in America, we don't own our 2,000 acres in East Texas.
[00:46:48.106 --> 00:46:49.107]  We're just people
[00:46:50.197 --> 00:46:53.900]  That have lived there for a long time and still want to think we own it.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.201]  We don't own that property.
[00:46:55.201 --> 00:46:56.262]  The government does.
[00:46:56.262 --> 00:46:59.124]  The foreign banks do.
[00:46:59.124 --> 00:47:02.806]  And it doesn't matter how many grape orchards we put in.
[00:47:02.806 --> 00:47:04.828]  It doesn't matter how many honeybees we put in.
[00:47:04.828 --> 00:47:06.489]  It doesn't matter what we do.
[00:47:06.489 --> 00:47:08.391]  They're not going to let us make money.
[00:47:08.391 --> 00:47:12.894]  They've got it all actuaried out to where everybody else is selling out their property.
[00:47:15.071 --> 00:47:16.372]  So that we're a nation of slaves.
[00:47:16.372 --> 00:47:23.195]  And now they got the Marines and the Army training against people wearing John Deere caps and overalls to kill them.
[00:47:23.195 --> 00:47:31.239]  When they say, we're not paying the taxes like Bundy, we're done, we're not leaving, it's our property, they're going to send in the Marines and the Army.
[00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:32.059]  And you know what?
[00:47:32.059 --> 00:47:34.460]  The people are going to stand up against it.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.722]  And the Marines are going to end up defecting over to the side of the American people.
[00:47:37.722 --> 00:47:43.264]  If we talk to the Marines and the Army now and have a public debate about this, we will change it.
[00:47:43.264 --> 00:47:44.205]  We will change history.
[00:47:46.564 --> 00:47:51.166]  But I wanted to take you full circle from the Army and the Marines training to fight what?
[00:47:51.166 --> 00:47:52.486]  Rural communities.
[00:47:52.486 --> 00:47:54.647]  Because a country boy can survive.
[00:47:54.647 --> 00:47:56.027]  Because we can skin a buck.
[00:47:56.027 --> 00:47:58.548]  We can run a trot line.
[00:47:58.548 --> 00:48:02.129]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:05.270]  Because these old boys were raised on shotguns.
[00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:07.211]  We say grace.
[00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:09.752]  We say amen.
[00:48:09.752 --> 00:48:12.953]  And if you ain't down with that, what's the exact words?
[00:48:14.389 --> 00:48:22.356]  And if he ain't into that, or the modern parlance would be if he ain't down with that, then we don't give a you-know-what.
[00:48:22.356 --> 00:48:24.137]  And we say grace, we say amen.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.121]  If you're not into that, well you know we don't give a damn.
[00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:32.342]  And that's what it comes down to is they know we won't sell out.
[00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:34.503]  They know we won't compromise anymore.
[00:48:34.503 --> 00:48:35.784]  We've been pushed too far.
[00:48:35.784 --> 00:48:38.044]  And so they train for open treason.
[00:48:38.044 --> 00:48:39.205]  What did Obama say?
[00:48:39.205 --> 00:48:40.505]  Bitter clingers.
[00:48:40.505 --> 00:48:45.007]  In a secret meeting with billionaires and million dollar donors, who are they talking about?
[00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:49.510]  We're going to get these Christians clinging to their Bibles and their guns.
[00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:50.790]  We're shutting them down.
[00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.671]  We're shutting off their power plants.
[00:48:52.671 --> 00:48:54.231]  We're shutting down their jobs.
[00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:55.872]  We're shutting down their roads.
[00:48:55.872 --> 00:48:57.532]  We're shutting down their communities.
[00:48:57.532 --> 00:48:59.113]  We're buying off their preachers.
[00:48:59.113 --> 00:49:01.354]  We're training the military to go up against them.
[00:49:01.354 --> 00:49:02.774]  We got the cities.
[00:49:02.774 --> 00:49:04.074]  We got the kids.
[00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:05.455]  This is our country.
[00:49:05.455 --> 00:49:08.556]  We're going to take them down!
[00:49:08.556 --> 00:49:11.276]  Who did the Weathermen say they were going to put 50 million Americans?
[00:49:11.276 --> 00:49:12.877]  They said rural people.
[00:49:14.301 --> 00:49:16.301]  Rural people.
[00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:21.903]  Rural people who aren't in there watching their Dish Network all day and drinking whiskey.
[00:49:21.903 --> 00:49:24.883]  Most of the rural people are just absolutely devastated wrecks.
[00:49:24.883 --> 00:49:32.325]  But there are a hardcore working group out there that's still hanging on and that the system knows is already not.
[00:49:32.325 --> 00:49:37.846]  Look, it's a duty now if you're rural and hanging on baritone owls to not pay as much as you can.
[00:49:37.846 --> 00:49:39.607]  To survive, you got to get out of the system.
[00:49:39.607 --> 00:49:40.687]  That's why they're harassing
[00:49:41.667 --> 00:49:48.830]  Farmers markets and Amish and Mennonites and poor minority groups setting up farms and Mexican farmers that are in this country.
[00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:59.716]  Because they know communities have been formed of swap meets and groups and barter is now getting set up and people in rural areas are working together and so under NORTHCOM and the Rural Affairs...
[00:50:00.456 --> 00:50:02.777]  System, it says the Pentagon's over it.
[00:50:02.777 --> 00:50:07.418]  They are designing the rollout for the total takeover of rural areas.
[00:50:07.418 --> 00:50:12.819]  With clergy response team spies, with local enviro spies, all of it.
[00:50:12.819 --> 00:50:21.301]  And when you see these people come to your town, they are literally Rockefeller and Ford Foundation above CIA to take your town over and take you down.
[00:50:22.745 --> 00:50:30.291]  And it is your duty, ladies and gentlemen, to keep this country going and to survive and thrive and to have strong families and put in gardens.
[00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:34.675]  And it's your duty when you see people selling vegetables on the side of the road to buy from them.
[00:50:34.675 --> 00:50:37.658]  And it's your duty to find that organic milk from the Amish.
[00:50:37.658 --> 00:50:39.619]  And it's your duty to raise a garden.
[00:50:39.619 --> 00:50:47.126]  And it's your duty out there, folks, in little steps, to get off their system and to set up off-the-grid systems.
[00:50:47.126 --> 00:50:50.509]  That's why they're shutting down lemonade stands, shutting down city markets,
[00:50:51.189 --> 00:50:53.795]  They want you in a giant reservation.
[00:50:53.795 --> 00:50:55.499]  They don't want you self-sufficient.
[00:50:55.499 --> 00:50:57.985]  Just like they shut down the Comanche and the Arapaho.
[00:50:57.985 --> 00:50:59.027]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.362 --> 00:51:03.723]  Harvest Right is the world's first in-home freeze-dryer.

[00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:09.011]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:52:09.011 --> 00:52:10.652]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:52:10.652 --> 00:52:16.794]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:16.974 --> 00:52:23.016]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:52:23.016 --> 00:52:26.958]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[00:52:29.879 --> 00:52:38.283]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:52:38.283 --> 00:52:40.383]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:52:40.383 --> 00:52:41.424]  It's a war against the truth.

[00:54:02.557 --> 00:54:19.807]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only gettin' mugged if you go downtown
[00:54:25.482 --> 00:54:29.624]  And the Pentagon is made up of country boys, mainly.
[00:54:29.624 --> 00:54:31.665]  That's just on record.
[00:54:51.285 --> 00:54:54.587]  But they got robots and drones coming online.
[00:54:54.587 --> 00:55:11.497]  And when they get done taking down the last vestigial primitive humans, when they get done, they're gonna come after all of you.
[00:55:11.497 --> 00:55:17.940]  By the way, who is it in Mexico that's beaten all of the cartels?
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:18.701]  Keep it rolling under me.
[00:55:20.202 --> 00:55:22.663]  Who is it that's beating the government and restoring order?
[00:55:22.663 --> 00:55:25.043]  It's the country boys.
[00:55:25.043 --> 00:55:27.404]  With guns.
[00:55:27.404 --> 00:55:31.485]  That's the same thing.
[00:55:31.485 --> 00:55:34.966]  The people are now following them because they're not shaking people down.
[00:55:34.966 --> 00:55:39.168]  They just want to work on their farms and ranches.
[00:55:39.168 --> 00:55:40.428]  It's the same thing in Chiapas.
[00:55:42.108 --> 00:55:46.152]  For 20 plus years, beating the whole Mexican government in the cartels.
[00:55:46.152 --> 00:55:48.133]  Just a bunch of farmers.
[00:55:48.133 --> 00:55:53.098]  They just want to live and be free.
[00:55:53.098 --> 00:55:57.261]  They're still humans.
[00:55:57.261 --> 00:56:01.225]  And they're the country boys, and they're all over the world.
[00:56:01.225 --> 00:56:09.412]  In Africa, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in the rural areas of France and Germany, Asia,
[00:56:10.507 --> 00:56:13.649]  I had a good friend in New York City.
[00:56:13.649 --> 00:56:18.431]  He'd never call me by my name, just Hillbilly.
[00:56:18.431 --> 00:56:20.992]  We're gonna get Baggage Shawn at 15 after to take your calls.
[00:56:20.992 --> 00:56:22.393]  20 after, holding 20 minutes until the next hour.
[00:56:22.393 --> 00:56:24.834]  My grandpa told me how I evolved the land.
[00:56:24.834 --> 00:56:28.636]  And he has taught him to be a businessman.
[00:56:28.636 --> 00:56:36.079]  He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights.
[00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:39.141]  And I'd send him some homemade wine.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:49.323]  When you realize the whole Pentagon trains to take on what they see as indigenous, self-sufficient populations.
[00:56:49.323 --> 00:56:56.705]  What does the special forces train you to do?
[00:56:56.705 --> 00:56:58.425]  Live out in the woods.
[00:56:58.425 --> 00:56:59.126]  Shoot a gun.
[00:56:59.126 --> 00:57:01.246]  Be self-sufficient.
[00:57:01.246 --> 00:57:02.266]  Not be a coward.
[00:57:02.266 --> 00:57:04.887]  And where do they mainly recruit?
[00:57:04.887 --> 00:57:06.608]  The people from the country.
[00:57:09.068 --> 00:57:10.769]  The bull riders.
[00:57:10.769 --> 00:57:15.050]  The people that aren't cowards.
[00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:17.791]  And now they're coming after all of us, worldwide.
[00:57:17.791 --> 00:57:20.852]  Because we're not cowards and we just want to be good men.
[00:57:20.852 --> 00:57:24.814]  We want to build a civilization that's based on being honest.
[00:57:24.814 --> 00:57:26.855]  We don't like scum.
[00:57:26.855 --> 00:57:30.476]  We don't like cowards and trash and double dealers and backstabbers.
[00:57:30.476 --> 00:57:33.717]  And little towns all over this world.
[00:57:37.918 --> 00:57:41.900]  That's why we're under attack.
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:48.862]  And I'll tell you what scares the establishment.
[00:57:48.862 --> 00:57:52.624]  Because they know worldwide people are trying to get back to that right now.
[00:57:52.624 --> 00:57:56.565]  You go out with all these yuppies and trendies, they're starting to get into that as well.
[00:57:56.565 --> 00:57:58.986]  And the liberal women are starting to get into it.
[00:57:58.986 --> 00:58:02.767]  Because they understand that we're losing our humanity.
[00:58:02.767 --> 00:58:06.469]  And the globalists know that whether it's Mexico or whether it's in Southern Nevada,
[00:58:07.844 --> 00:58:15.989]  But whether it's in rural France, it's the farmers and the ranchers that burn down the GMO crops.
[00:58:15.989 --> 00:58:18.971]  It's the farmers and ranchers that kick the butts of the riot police.
[00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:21.213]  It's the farmers and the ranchers that won't back down.
[00:58:22.844 --> 00:58:24.765]  They're scared of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:24.765 --> 00:58:27.007]  That's why they're training to wage war on us.
[00:58:27.007 --> 00:58:31.350]  We need to wage InfoWars on their operatives who belong to us.
[00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:33.432]  So they're on the right side.
[00:58:33.432 --> 00:58:35.213]  Alright, second hour coming up.
[00:58:35.213 --> 00:58:36.674]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:58:36.674 --> 00:58:40.637]  InfoWars.com!
[00:58:40.637 --> 00:58:44.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.121]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.977 --> 00:58:53.399]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:58:53.399 --> 00:58:55.821]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:58:55.821 --> 00:59:04.427]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:59:04.427 --> 00:59:19.757]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula, sourced from powerful organic herbs, and then concentrated for maximum
[00:59:19.997 --> 00:59:20.457]  Let's go!
[00:59:53.004 --> 00:59:55.409]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.409 --> 00:59:58.174]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.795 --> 01:00:09.618]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.618 --> 01:00:11.198]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.198 --> 01:00:12.759]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.759 --> 01:00:16.941]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.941 --> 01:00:21.004]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.942]  We're taking your phone calls for the next 20 minutes.
[01:00:26.942 --> 01:00:31.746]  The Dr. Nick Begich is joining us to cover the waterfront of Key Intel.
[01:00:31.746 --> 01:00:33.828]  Now they're trying to run the natives off their land in Alaska.
[01:00:33.828 --> 01:00:35.289]  That's going to be part of it.
[01:00:35.289 --> 01:00:38.292]  This theme that's developed today, just looking at the news.
[01:00:38.292 --> 01:00:42.315]  Doris in Tennessee, then Michael, Michael, Jim, Eugene, and others.
[01:00:42.315 --> 01:00:43.276]  Thanks for calling, Doris.
[01:00:43.276 --> 01:00:45.638]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:00:45.638 --> 01:00:46.779]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:46.779 --> 01:00:47.961]  How you holding up?
[01:00:47.961 --> 01:00:48.561]  I'm doing good.
[01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:49.142]  How are you doings?
[01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:50.891]  I'm fine.
[01:00:50.891 --> 01:00:58.356]  I called before I told you that we went because of your TV broadcast for Prison Planet.
[01:00:58.356 --> 01:00:58.917]  Yes ma'am.
[01:00:58.917 --> 01:01:00.838]  You know, we went to Montana.
[01:01:00.838 --> 01:01:06.263]  We don't fly a lot because of the TSA.
[01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:08.584]  But we did fly out to meet Chuck Baldwin.
[01:01:08.584 --> 01:01:09.845]  Great!
[01:01:09.845 --> 01:01:15.230]  And I think that he is going to try to start a lot of non-501c3 charges.
[01:01:18.052 --> 01:01:23.573]  Yeah, it's time to get Chuck Baldwin on for an hour via Skype soon, next week or something to talk about.
[01:01:23.573 --> 01:01:26.714]  Why should churches even be 501c3 and be under the IRS?
[01:01:26.714 --> 01:01:31.975]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:01:31.975 --> 01:01:33.615]  Exactly.
[01:01:33.615 --> 01:01:35.795]  And that's the whole point.
[01:01:35.795 --> 01:01:38.716]  I mean, I agree with you about everything.
[01:01:38.716 --> 01:01:45.437]  I joined Prison Planet TV network on the internet the day that Fukushima happened.
[01:01:46.696 --> 01:01:48.638]  And I agree with everything you say.
[01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.619]  I know you're right.
[01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:51.620]  There's no doubt.
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.523]  This country is a country under judgment.
[01:01:55.523 --> 01:02:02.750]  We are doing and lifting up the exact opposite of what God's Word says to do.
[01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:05.612]  So Chuck Baldwin is going to do that.
[01:02:05.612 --> 01:02:09.015]  Now, this is supposed to be a Christian country.
[01:02:09.015 --> 01:02:12.718]  But the Christians are too cowardly to stand up for what's right.
[01:02:13.934 --> 01:02:16.776]  And the preachers and the pulpits are silent.
[01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:19.658]  Well, that's because they're not churches.
[01:02:19.658 --> 01:02:23.561]  They're 501c3 government-run institutions.
[01:02:23.561 --> 01:02:25.142]  They're afraid of the IRS.
[01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:28.945]  We have state-run churches in America, just like the old Soviet Union.
[01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:32.148]  The old Soviet Union had churches, they were just state-run.
[01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:35.110]  I know that, except for David Bonhoeffer.
[01:02:37.288 --> 01:02:41.832]  Who died two days before the war was over in Poland.
[01:02:41.832 --> 01:02:43.314]  I know, it's incredible.
[01:02:43.314 --> 01:02:45.315]  Yeah, I know.
[01:02:45.315 --> 01:02:46.016]  I'm telling you.
[01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:46.677]  No, I know you know.
[01:02:46.677 --> 01:02:48.779]  I'm just telling listeners that don't know, yeah.
[01:02:48.779 --> 01:02:49.419]  Judgment.
[01:02:49.419 --> 01:02:51.821]  You're right.
[01:02:51.821 --> 01:02:55.084]  God bless you.
[01:02:55.084 --> 01:02:55.525]  Anything else?
[01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.550]  That's it.
[01:02:57.550 --> 01:02:58.531]  Thank you so much for calling.
[01:02:58.531 --> 01:03:00.272]  Good to hear from you, Doris.
[01:03:00.272 --> 01:03:04.076]  Look, even if you don't believe in God, folks, we are becoming a very corrupt society.
[01:03:04.076 --> 01:03:05.978]  And evil's not being restrained.
[01:03:05.978 --> 01:03:08.180]  And then it wants to declare war on good.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.904]  I mean, that's an endgame scenario.
[01:03:11.904 --> 01:03:13.726]  Evil always tries to totally take over.
[01:03:13.726 --> 01:03:16.509]  It doesn't just let you sit across the fence from it.
[01:03:19.187 --> 01:03:20.187]  Michael in Tennessee.
[01:03:20.187 --> 01:03:21.248]  Another call from Tennessee.
[01:03:21.248 --> 01:03:21.828]  You're on the air.
[01:03:21.828 --> 01:03:22.188]  Go ahead.
[01:03:22.188 --> 01:03:25.389]  Hi, this is Michael.
[01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:41.494]  I'd like to start off just saying that the reason that you as InfoWars and people like Matt Drudge are doing this is very explicit when it says in Luke 12 3, therefore, whatever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light.
[01:03:41.494 --> 01:03:45.195]  And that which ye have spoken in the ear and in the closet, that's new world order.
[01:03:45.675 --> 01:03:54.743]  Now, if I may, I'd like to say something a little bit satirical.
[01:03:54.743 --> 01:04:11.017]  In our current paradox, where up is down, left is right, lies are truth, I would like to have voted for Alex in Infowars as the biggest liar of the century, because all you do is put it out there and tell the truth, and since truth is lies, that makes you the biggest liar.
[01:04:11.866 --> 01:04:18.194]  I guess in the 1984 world, telling the truth is a revolutionary act, and so I guess according to the establishment, I am a big liar.
[01:04:18.194 --> 01:04:28.185]  But I made the point yesterday that I am a huge liar in that it's not an intentional lie, but it's usually worse than what I'm saying.
[01:04:28.185 --> 01:04:31.749]  So when you speak in error, it is kind of a lie, even if it's unintentional.
[01:04:32.566 --> 01:04:35.028]  So, you know, people say, oh, you're absolutely right.
[01:04:35.028 --> 01:04:36.709]  I'm not absolutely right, folks.
[01:04:36.709 --> 01:04:38.951]  A, I make mistakes on factoids and things.
[01:04:38.951 --> 01:04:42.614]  B, it's a big, wide world, and nobody knows that much.
[01:04:42.614 --> 01:04:44.575]  The more I learn, the more I know I don't know.
[01:04:44.575 --> 01:04:45.636]  I just know this.
[01:04:45.636 --> 01:04:48.919]  The establishment are a bunch of scum who are out of control.
[01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:50.340]  Thank you so much for the call, Michael.
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.521]  Another Michael, Jim, Eugene, and others.
[01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.682]  Your calls are coming up at 800-259-9231.
[01:04:53.682 --> 01:04:54.923]  Then, Dr. Nick Begich from Alaska.
[01:05:00.259 --> 01:05:06.382]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:05:06.382 --> 01:05:09.684]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:05:09.684 --> 01:05:11.425]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:05:11.425 --> 01:05:17.828]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:05:17.828 --> 01:05:23.731]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:05:23.871 --> 01:05:27.835]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:05:27.835 --> 01:05:30.899]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:05:30.899 --> 01:05:39.187]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:05:39.187 --> 01:05:41.290]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:42.331]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:05:42.691 --> 01:05:51.643]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:07:00.074 --> 01:07:04.096]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:07:04.096 --> 01:07:08.458]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:12.140]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:15.161]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:22.745]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:07:22.745 --> 01:07:26.387]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:07:26.587 --> 01:07:31.073]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:07:31.073 --> 01:07:37.041]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:07:37.041 --> 01:07:37.882]  Fluoride.
[01:07:37.882 --> 01:07:40.986]  It's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:07:40.986 --> 01:07:43.729]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:07:43.729 --> 01:07:45.071]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:07:45.211 --> 01:07:46.592]  It's time to take action.
[01:07:46.592 --> 01:07:48.412]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:06.779]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.779 --> 01:08:09.060]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:15.796 --> 01:08:35.967]  We're taking your phone calls right now about the attack on rural communities under Obama's UN UNESCO-directed Rural Affairs Commission that is meant to run as kind of a Marshall Plan the destruction and implosion of rural communities by the new taxes and regulations set up to totally bankrupt those communities.
[01:08:35.967 --> 01:08:40.029]  The Bundy Ranch is a microcosm of 23 other families, 24 other families
[01:08:41.710 --> 01:08:42.131]  We're good to go.
[01:09:05.902 --> 01:09:08.883]  And then sell it to you at record high prices.
[01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:12.884]  That's the New World Order screwjob managed economy model.
[01:09:12.884 --> 01:09:26.266]  So we were bringing that subject up, dovetailing it with articles up on Infowars.com, ahead of Dr. Nick Begich, who formerly headed up Rural Affairs for one of the largest native tribes in Alaska.
[01:09:26.266 --> 01:09:27.967]  His brother, of course, is a U.S.
[01:09:27.967 --> 01:09:28.647]  Senator.
[01:09:28.647 --> 01:09:32.708]  They're running them off their land and trying to bring it under total federal control.
[01:09:33.993 --> 01:09:36.275]  And so what's been done to the natives is now being done to everybody.
[01:09:36.275 --> 01:09:37.315]  This is the model.
[01:09:37.315 --> 01:09:42.539]  And then we'll spend a few segments with him on that and then get into a bunch of other geopolitical and brain chip news.
[01:09:42.539 --> 01:09:46.141]  He pioneered Pentagon plans to put brain chips in troops.
[01:09:46.141 --> 01:09:48.683]  Now that was in the Reuters and AP last week.
[01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:53.626]  So we're going to be covering that with Dr. Nick Baggage coming up.
[01:09:53.626 --> 01:09:57.509]  Some of the other articles up on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:58.692 --> 01:10:03.935]  Again, break down the Marines training to take on rural communities in a new secret document.
[01:10:03.935 --> 01:10:09.239]  Other stories, victory for student who stood up for his gun rights and gun t-shirt suspension.
[01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:13.061]  Officials, not public servants, lift suspension.
[01:10:13.061 --> 01:10:17.124]  Clear record of high school senior, you're allowed to wear an NRA shirt.
[01:10:17.124 --> 01:10:18.705]  See how that works?
[01:10:18.705 --> 01:10:21.447]  You want to get in trouble to show it's a fraud.
[01:10:21.447 --> 01:10:23.488]  Not comply and be a slave.
[01:10:23.488 --> 01:10:27.330]  You don't comply with stuff that isn't common law constitutional.
[01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:27.811]  You fight it.
[01:10:29.056 --> 01:10:32.378]  Police now armed for war against returning veterans.
[01:10:32.378 --> 01:10:34.579]  A huge breaking Paul Joseph Watson article.
[01:10:34.579 --> 01:10:36.720]  Print me that guys, it just broke.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.263]  Cops in armored vehicles ask for residents, are you coming to take our guns away?
[01:10:42.263 --> 01:10:46.885]  Establishment media insist Al Qaeda on cutting edge of encryption tech.
[01:10:46.885 --> 01:10:53.008]  Leaked documents reveal Marine Corps urban training center based on US town training for war.
[01:10:53.008 --> 01:10:56.170]  Robocops resemble police from dystopian classic Brazil.
[01:10:58.103 --> 01:10:59.264]  The meat crisis is here.
[01:10:59.264 --> 01:11:01.125]  Again, I just mentioned that article.
[01:11:01.125 --> 01:11:02.506]  Grassroots militia.
[01:11:02.506 --> 01:11:05.308]  Citizens of Mexico rediscover their God-given rights.
[01:11:05.308 --> 01:11:10.191]  That's an article breaking down what's happening in Mexico as the militias restore order.
[01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:13.994]  And we've got the videos I shot last weekend breaking that down.
[01:11:13.994 --> 01:11:17.476]  But a new article on it with new developments.
[01:11:17.476 --> 01:11:19.918]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[01:11:24.261 --> 01:11:25.942]  And PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:25.942 --> 01:11:28.825]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:11:28.825 --> 01:11:30.987]  Michael in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:32.908]  Thanks for calling.
[01:11:32.908 --> 01:11:34.810]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:39.593]  May the Lord continue to bless and protect you and yours in these turbulent times.
[01:11:39.593 --> 01:11:46.439]  I'm calling from Texas, and we all know that the demise of the Republic has been in the works for quite some time.
[01:11:46.439 --> 01:11:48.661]  The corruption is so bad.
[01:11:48.661 --> 01:11:53.885]  They're pulling every card and pivot and Saul Alinsky trip that they can to remove every
[01:11:54.719 --> 01:12:01.362]  I would like your opinion in regards to an email that I received today in regards to strategic plans and plots.
[01:12:01.362 --> 01:12:07.024]  This is hearsay that I've heard that I'm reading off in the email that I have but evidently
[01:12:24.983 --> 01:12:33.626]  Supposedly Obama's conferred with his lawyers and has been advised that he can run a third term if he resigns between now and November 4th.
[01:12:33.626 --> 01:12:36.287]  And has Biden step in and pardon him.
[01:12:36.287 --> 01:12:39.588]  That would take care of the criminal charges.
[01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:45.871]  And opens the doors to another two terms if he runs for president in November.
[01:12:45.871 --> 01:12:46.751]  What do you think about that?
[01:12:46.751 --> 01:12:47.752]  Is that possible?
[01:12:47.752 --> 01:12:48.672]  I appreciate your call.
[01:12:48.672 --> 01:12:49.812]  Let me answer that.
[01:12:49.812 --> 01:12:52.153]  The sky's the limit with these people.
[01:12:52.153 --> 01:12:53.874]  I continue to underestimate them.
[01:12:54.634 --> 01:12:56.815]  So, I want to be clear.
[01:12:56.815 --> 01:12:59.275]  On the surface, it sounds like it's ridiculous.
[01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:11.078]  A. He's a puppet who served well to get a lot of the agenda through and create racial division for the offshore crime syndicates that are tax-exempt that rule this country by fraud.
[01:13:11.078 --> 01:13:14.339]  They want to put a new puppet in down the road.
[01:13:14.339 --> 01:13:17.720]  But if they think the Tea Party could win and get a Rand Paul or Ted Cruz in,
[01:13:20.802 --> 01:13:29.508]  It's in the cards to not resign and pardon himself and run again, but to shut off nukes in the U.S.
[01:13:29.508 --> 01:13:33.551]  and then declare martial law claiming that the Republicans or the Liberty Movement did it.
[01:13:33.551 --> 01:13:40.676]  And I'm not saying the Republicans are good at the leadership level, but the Democrats could double-cross Boehner and the rest of them.
[01:13:43.399 --> 01:14:01.563]  And I told you that I see them preparing for a breakdown of society, a takeover, which they'll engineer, and I can see in the cards, in maybe six, seven scenarios that are in their hand, they can play a couple cards, they can play them all, they can play one of them, they can be smart and fold.
[01:14:01.563 --> 01:14:07.925]  But I told you I see them nuking a major city with a low-yield weapon that would still kill 10,000-plus people.
[01:14:07.925 --> 01:14:09.865]  I see them hitting Dallas, Denver, Cleveland.
[01:14:12.665 --> 01:14:13.406]  Cities like that.
[01:14:13.406 --> 01:14:18.329]  Because the CFR bragged and said those were the targets.
[01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:19.389]  Gary Hart did.
[01:14:19.389 --> 01:14:20.230]  He likes to brag.
[01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:26.314]  He's the guy they have that says what they're going to do beforehand, I've seen repeatedly.
[01:14:26.314 --> 01:14:27.515]  And they would hit with a nuke.
[01:14:27.515 --> 01:14:34.939]  Now, Obama then said of two months ago, the number one threat he sees now is just a rogue group nuking Manhattan.
[01:14:34.939 --> 01:14:38.622]  Or, you know, they could nuke that group of traders when Congress is in session.
[01:14:40.128 --> 01:14:51.956]  Folks, the Globalist could forfeit in the endgame during a State of the Union and wipe out the entire group of puppets and bring in COG to the National Security Council.
[01:14:51.956 --> 01:15:01.603]  The bold stroke oft do miss, but the bold stroke oft win the whole game.
[01:15:01.603 --> 01:15:06.506]  So, they got Hail Mary's in their cards, in their fists.
[01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:19.147]  They could simulate an EMP attack, take down the power grid, pose during that, use that to bring in total control.
[01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:21.307]  World War III with the Russians.
[01:15:21.307 --> 01:15:26.029]  But we're entering that historical zone of crazy town.
[01:15:26.029 --> 01:15:27.089]  We're entering it now.
[01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:28.389]  I told you this years ago.
[01:15:28.389 --> 01:15:29.730]  We're here.
[01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:33.571]  And it's just crazy town from here on out.
[01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.871]  Because it's not going to end like other cycles.
[01:15:35.871 --> 01:15:40.233]  It's the quickening, the singularity, all of it.
[01:15:40.233 --> 01:15:41.033]  This is it.
[01:15:41.033 --> 01:15:41.833]  Call it whatever you want.
[01:15:44.252 --> 01:15:50.017]  And it's now the time for everybody to be reality-based and admit how crazy things are.
[01:15:50.017 --> 01:16:01.425]  If you deny... Yeah, Alex Jones is right about the NSA and the checkpoints, the armored vehicles and GMO and so many other things, but he's still kind of a crazy man.
[01:16:01.425 --> 01:16:03.707]  Well, yeah, I'm crazy, jumping up and down, trying to stop it.
[01:16:03.707 --> 01:16:05.228]  You're right.
[01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:13.375]  Because I know they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and fluoride in the water and GMO that creates 90-plus percent sterilization in all mammal species within three generations.
[01:16:15.114 --> 01:16:16.815]  I mean, I know it's the end of days.
[01:16:16.815 --> 01:16:18.436]  It's the end of humanity.
[01:16:18.436 --> 01:16:22.579]  Even if God isn't real, the globalists are using it as a template, a scientific overwrite.
[01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:25.000]  It's happening.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.022]  And I'm reflecting what they're doing, so I sound nuts.
[01:16:28.022 --> 01:16:29.042]  It is crazy.
[01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:32.985]  But I'm not the one doing it.
[01:16:32.985 --> 01:16:41.190]  I went to urban warfare drills because Marine Corps sources told me to, in 96, 97, 98, 99, and I couldn't believe what I saw when I got on tape.
[01:16:42.318 --> 01:16:50.464]  The Marines breaking in our hotels, roughing us up, you know, special groups, not the average Marines.
[01:16:50.464 --> 01:16:56.869]  Foreign troops, checkpoints, training to kill Americans, people begging not to have their guns taken in the drills.
[01:16:56.869 --> 01:16:58.250]  I mean, I brought you the footage.
[01:17:04.528 --> 01:17:08.770]  And now they've been training secretly for decades and they're ready to roll with this.
[01:17:08.770 --> 01:17:10.611]  It's incredible high treason.
[01:17:10.611 --> 01:17:14.213]  Eugene in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:15.433]  Good afternoon.
[01:17:15.433 --> 01:17:19.855]  You're right, it is a little bit crazy, and that's why we need to point all this stuff out.
[01:17:19.855 --> 01:17:28.099]  You might be proud, but I submitted a We Will Resist TSA and NSA tyranny video a few months back.
[01:17:28.099 --> 01:17:29.520]  And it was real easy.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.222]  I learned iMovie and just created my own movie.
[01:17:33.222 --> 01:17:33.922]  Anybody can do this.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:40.243]  And, uh, I created a webpage two months ago called hvenews.com.
[01:17:40.243 --> 01:17:41.883]  High voltage news.
[01:17:41.883 --> 01:17:45.745]  And I'm spreading the info war just like you do.
[01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:46.085]  Good.
[01:17:46.085 --> 01:17:47.706]  Just don't get sucked into the infighting.
[01:17:47.706 --> 01:17:49.447]  Stay focused on real issues.
[01:17:49.447 --> 01:17:51.148]  Don't let them get you off balance.
[01:17:51.148 --> 01:17:53.829]  Continue to report and break news.
[01:17:53.829 --> 01:17:55.470]  And you'll have a huge effect.
[01:17:55.470 --> 01:18:01.113]  What's your take on the beef price is all time high, other meat prices all time high?
[01:18:01.113 --> 01:18:01.773]  It's only the beginning.
[01:18:02.907 --> 01:18:09.911]  It fits into the Agenda 21 and making corporation the only entity that can provide the masses the food.
[01:18:09.911 --> 01:18:14.874]  Yeah, record profits while providing you much less.
[01:18:14.874 --> 01:18:17.015]  With poison in it, you know.
[01:18:17.015 --> 01:18:20.917]  With, radiated, with GMO and hormones, exactly.
[01:18:20.917 --> 01:18:24.939]  Yeah, that's why I just bought my Patriot Supply stash yesterday.
[01:18:24.939 --> 01:18:28.001]  Well, thanks for supporting that sponsor.
[01:18:28.001 --> 01:18:29.322]  Oh, you're welcome.
[01:18:29.322 --> 01:18:31.743]  It's all good and it fits in with the self
[01:18:32.463 --> 01:18:38.825]  Reliance that we all have in our ability that they don't like Absolutely, God bless you, sir.
[01:18:38.825 --> 01:18:59.272]  We've got baggage coming on for 20 minutes the next hour, but we'll take some calls with him He's a generalist kind of like I am he can talk to any subject so Jim Chad Carrie sue and others We'll get to calls by 45 after with baggage and then get back into news with him 20 minutes of the next hour I appreciate him joining us best-selling author And he's got multiple

[01:19:00.946 --> 01:19:03.909]  's and different sciences.
[01:19:03.909 --> 01:19:05.971]  So, again, his brother is a U.S.
[01:19:05.971 --> 01:19:06.953]  Senator from Alaska.
[01:19:06.953 --> 01:19:08.374]  His father was a famous congressman.
[01:19:08.374 --> 01:19:10.316]  They clearly killed to shut him up.
[01:19:10.316 --> 01:19:12.259]  We're going to talk about the waterfront.
[01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:16.189]  Straight ahead with Dr. Nick Bagus briefly since he mentioned it.

[01:20:03.206 --> 01:20:05.967]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:08.727]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:35.651]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:35.651 --> 01:20:41.375]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:44.938]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:21:59.378 --> 01:22:02.182]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:02.182 --> 01:22:05.406]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots.
[01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:07.287]  Over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:22:07.287 --> 01:22:15.412]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:15.412 --> 01:22:19.935]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:23.737]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:29.861]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:29.861 --> 01:22:33.023]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:33.023 --> 01:22:38.387]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:38.387 --> 01:22:46.572]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:22:46.572 --> 01:22:46.752]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:22:53.797 --> 01:22:54.238]  We're good.
[01:22:59.358 --> 01:23:00.678]  Attention America!
[01:23:00.678 --> 01:23:08.301]  Within a little-known government document is devastating information that could cost the United States its most valuable asset.
[01:23:08.301 --> 01:23:11.682]  My name is Jeff Opdycke, former reporter for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:23:11.682 --> 01:23:20.845]  I've uncovered shocking evidence within the details of document FT-900, revealing the largest cover-up of President Obama's career.
[01:23:20.845 --> 01:23:24.346]  This will have a substantial impact on our nation.
[01:23:24.346 --> 01:23:27.507]  Millions of Americans will fall into poverty overnight.
[01:23:28.027 --> 01:23:35.373]  A recent report from the Treasury Department said an event of this nature has, quote, the potential to be catastrophic.
[01:23:35.373 --> 01:23:45.241]  Within a matter of weeks, the way of life for millions of Americans will be destroyed, and the standard of living will be like nothing this country has seen in nearly a century.
[01:23:45.241 --> 01:23:48.984]  To learn how you can protect yourself and your family from this government attack,
[01:23:49.444 --> 01:23:53.792]  Visit www.ObamaSecret1.com.
[01:23:53.792 --> 01:23:57.158]  Again that's www.ObamaSecret1.com.
[01:24:38.693 --> 01:24:49.277]  Folks, if you think I'm going to sit around while the world goes by and let the global technocrats dehumanize me and my family, you've got another thing coming.
[01:24:53.579 --> 01:24:55.821]  Monday through Friday, we're here live.
[01:24:55.821 --> 01:24:57.442]  11 a.m.
[01:24:57.442 --> 01:24:58.062]  to 2 p.m.
[01:24:58.062 --> 01:24:58.983]  Central.
[01:24:58.983 --> 01:25:01.565]  This Sunday, we got some special guests.
[01:25:01.565 --> 01:25:04.507]  They're going to be in studio 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:25:04.507 --> 01:25:07.690]  Join us for the live Sunday transmission.
[01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:10.472]  This Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:11.693]  Central Standard Time.
[01:25:14.775 --> 01:25:18.137]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Nick Begich joins us for the bottom of the next hour.
[01:25:18.137 --> 01:25:21.540]  We appreciate him being gracious with his time.
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:26.644]  He's the eldest son of a late United States Congressman from Alaska, Nick Begich Sr.
[01:25:26.644 --> 01:25:30.987]  And he's been a political activist virtually his whole life, as well as his mother has been.
[01:25:30.987 --> 01:25:33.148]  He's well-known in Alaska.
[01:25:33.148 --> 01:25:34.389]  Politics for his adult life.
[01:25:34.389 --> 01:25:42.796]  We're heading up some of the major tribes in the state, trying to get their rights and having multiple degrees in science.
[01:25:43.736 --> 01:25:52.602]  Baggage has also published articles in Science, Political Education, is a well-known lecturer, best-selling author, having presented throughout the United States and Europe.
[01:25:52.602 --> 01:25:55.364]  He's the publisher and co-owner of EarthPulse Press.
[01:25:55.364 --> 01:26:01.128]  Currently, Baggage consults for tribal organizations, private corporations, and others in a number of research areas.
[01:26:01.128 --> 01:26:04.630]  He headed up the Lay Institute for a while, a major institute.
[01:26:04.630 --> 01:26:12.695]  Baggage has authored, I won't go over all of that, EarthPulse.com, is just one of his sites, and his brother, of course, is one of the U.S.
[01:26:12.695 --> 01:26:13.076]  Senators.
[01:26:13.576 --> 01:26:30.900]  from Alaska, and he is the pioneer when it comes to documenting with the patents and lecturing the parliaments around the world on brain chips, psychological warfare, chemical warfare, what's covertly going on.
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:33.781]  But so much of what he's talked about is now mainstream.
[01:26:33.781 --> 01:26:35.441]  We did him on 18 years ago.
[01:26:35.441 --> 01:26:37.582]  I've been interviewing him since about nineteen
[01:26:38.797 --> 01:26:40.478]  Ninety-six or so.
[01:26:40.478 --> 01:26:42.179]  Nineteen ninety-seven.
[01:26:42.179 --> 01:26:47.921]  And everything he's talked about, unfortunately, has now gone from the area of science research to being mainstream.
[01:26:47.921 --> 01:26:49.402]  Weather control, you name it.
[01:26:49.402 --> 01:27:02.088]  But the first reason I wanted to get him on is news articles I've seen all over the country where the BLM is taking tribal lands, public lands, private lands, and claiming that they own them and control them when the feds already have more than half the country.
[01:27:02.888 --> 01:27:03.969]  What is behind this?
[01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:08.514]  I know he represents some of the tribes, trying to get them to be able to use their own land.
[01:27:08.514 --> 01:27:11.858]  So Dr. Baggage, we've got a few minutes left in this segment, long segment coming on.
[01:27:11.858 --> 01:27:13.260]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:15.442]  What's happening on the land grab front?
[01:27:15.442 --> 01:27:22.430]  Why do you think major corporations are lobbying governments, not just here but worldwide, to get people off rural land?
[01:27:23.359 --> 01:27:31.642]  Well, you know, here in Alaska only 1% of the entire state is privately owned, excluding Native Americans.
[01:27:31.642 --> 01:27:46.227]  Native Americans control approximately 9% of the land mass in Alaska, about 44 million acres, and that goes back to the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement Act of 1972, which was actually authored and got through the Congress by my father.
[01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:46.947]  It was the largest
[01:27:47.447 --> 01:27:47.827]  I think?
[01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:16.744]  Can use the surface estate of the land, whereas the regionals own the subsurface and mineral rights, as well as a big areas of surface estate.
[01:28:16.744 --> 01:28:24.966]  It was an experiment, really, and unfortunately, you know, once the law was passed, there was to be a lot of follow on work by dad, and that never happened.
[01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:31.748]  As you know, he was lost on a plane with Hale Boggs, who at the time was a majority leader in the U.S.
[01:28:31.748 --> 01:28:32.028]  House.
[01:28:33.328 --> 01:28:40.310]  You know, Dad was progressive on these issues with Native Americans, trying to find something better than a reservation model.
[01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:45.291]  Unfortunately, this really did not work as well as it could have.
[01:28:45.291 --> 01:28:55.474]  The tribal governments, who are the foundational governments in Alaska, weren't even recognized, except for one in Southeast, and actually there's another one up in the North.
[01:28:55.874 --> 01:28:56.134]  We're good.
[01:29:18.214 --> 01:29:21.635]  Of the tribes should have been negotiating the native land claims.
[01:29:21.635 --> 01:29:28.236]  Unfortunately, they weren't even recognized till over 20 years after the Settlement Act.
[01:29:28.236 --> 01:29:32.317]  And now I'm seeing the feds are saying they're going to take control and management-wise, is that good or bad?
[01:29:32.317 --> 01:29:36.298]  In your view, probably the top expert we could talk to from Alaska, Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:29:36.298 --> 01:29:45.760]  We'll spend five more minutes on this, just as an interesting point tying into the Bundys, and then we will expand into the brain chips they're announcing that DARPA wants to put in the troops.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.420]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.096 --> 01:29:53.017]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.017 --> 01:30:00.139]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.139 --> 01:30:09.221]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:30:09.221 --> 01:30:17.403]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:30:17.623 --> 01:30:22.505]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:30:22.505 --> 01:30:29.288]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:29.288 --> 01:30:36.391]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:30:36.471 --> 01:30:43.498]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:30:43.498 --> 01:30:47.982]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:30:47.982 --> 01:30:57.671]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:30:57.671 --> 01:30:59.372]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:00.513 --> 01:31:08.617]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:31:08.617 --> 01:31:10.859]  All the major networks are state-run.
[01:31:10.859 --> 01:31:13.560]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.982]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[01:31:17.982 --> 01:31:20.944]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:31:20.984 --> 01:31:28.613]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:31:28.613 --> 01:31:32.918]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:31:32.918 --> 01:31:34.720]  We are the true media.
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.323]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:31:37.383 --> 01:31:41.167]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:31:41.167 --> 01:31:45.512]  Join us at InfoWarsNews.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:45.512 --> 01:31:48.475]  Members can share their memberships with up to 11 people.
[01:31:48.475 --> 01:31:56.363]  By subscribing, you will literally be buying war bonds in the info war to expand our operation in the face of the tyrants.
[01:31:56.363 --> 01:31:58.125]  Join us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:10.952]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:10.952 --> 01:32:13.013]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:13.013 --> 01:32:13.894]  Fluoride.
[01:32:13.894 --> 01:32:15.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:15.815 --> 01:32:22.400]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:27.323]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:32:27.323 --> 01:32:30.205]  Reports documented of 15-point IQ in
[01:32:30.345 --> 01:32:30.865]  We're good.
[01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:16.793]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:16.793 --> 01:33:21.838]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:48.523 --> 01:33:48.966]  Yeah.
[01:33:53.007 --> 01:33:55.629]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:57.790]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:57.790 --> 01:34:01.072]  We are here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:34:01.072 --> 01:34:01.873]  until 2 p.m.
[01:34:01.873 --> 01:34:02.493]  Central.
[01:34:02.493 --> 01:34:08.918]  Back weeknights, 7 o'clock Central with PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:34:08.918 --> 01:34:10.459]  Dr. Nick Begich is our guest.
[01:34:10.459 --> 01:34:13.060]  We have loaded phone lines on a host of issues.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:15.382]  I want to get his take on the state of the world.
[01:34:15.382 --> 01:34:20.005]  DARPA coming out with this brain project, which is just a public rollout of what was already there.
[01:34:20.005 --> 01:34:22.287]  I want to get his true expert take on that.
[01:34:23.468 --> 01:34:24.969]  And so much more.
[01:34:24.969 --> 01:34:41.224]  Before we go back to Dr. Nick Baggage of EarthPulse.com, I should add, we sell quite a few of his best-selling books on weather modification, on emerging technologies, on empowerment of the human mind, the positive side of the march towards the singularity, the negative side.
[01:34:42.265 --> 01:34:47.368]  We carry his films and books at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:47.368 --> 01:34:52.031]  So you can find Angels Don't Play This Harp, the film and the book.
[01:34:52.031 --> 01:34:57.555]  We also have his book on mind control, controlling the human mind.
[01:34:57.555 --> 01:35:04.760]  We have just all of them at InfoWarsStore.com and they're all excellent if you want fact, not fiction.
[01:35:06.184 --> 01:35:15.288]  Also at Infowarsstore.com, you can find the Pro-Pure, Pro-One, and G2 filters that cut out the glyphosates, the fluoride, the heavy metals, you name it.
[01:35:15.288 --> 01:35:19.510]  Unlike any other gravity-fed stainless steel filter, annihilates the competition.
[01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:22.811]  See the side-by-side comparisons at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:22.811 --> 01:35:24.632]  And these units are less than leading competitor.
[01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:31.135]  That's why we carry exclusively Pro-1 and their G2.0 systems in stainless steel and in pitchers.
[01:35:31.135 --> 01:35:32.296]  They've got them all.
[01:35:32.296 --> 01:35:34.697]  You can also ask any questions or order over the phone.
[01:35:34.697 --> 01:35:35.237]  888-253-3139.
[01:35:35.237 --> 01:35:35.717]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:35.717 --> 01:35:38.939]  Then we have survival water filters like LifeStraw.
[01:35:38.939 --> 01:35:40.220]  We have the great non-GMO.
[01:35:46.963 --> 01:35:56.307]  heirloom seeds, the widest selection of anywhere out there, all the major developers of them, we buy from them at the lowest price we're authorized to sell.
[01:35:56.307 --> 01:36:05.131]  They'll make you sign contracts and not undercut the market, but we, you will have the certified lowest prices on seeds out there, period.
[01:36:05.131 --> 01:36:13.235]  This is what we believe in, selling high quality products that empower humanity to promote our free speech, pro-liberty, aggressive platform.
[01:36:14.397 --> 01:36:15.801]  We're not like NPR.
[01:36:15.801 --> 01:36:19.613]  We're not like all these government-funded institutions.
[01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:22.399]  MSNBC with the stimulus money.
[01:36:22.399 --> 01:36:25.540]  We're funded by free will, free association.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:31.821]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:31.821 --> 01:36:35.042]  And don't forget, the nightly news just gets so good.
[01:36:35.042 --> 01:36:37.542]  It's 30 minutes of condensed, powerful info.
[01:36:37.542 --> 01:36:45.464]  All nights when the news ends, then there might be 10, 20, 30, an hour of live coverage or interviews or events or special reports.
[01:36:46.504 --> 01:36:54.607]  7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern, 5 o'clock Pacific, 6 o'clock Montana Mountain Time, Tony Montana Time.
[01:36:54.607 --> 01:36:58.948]  It is all there with our great reporters, myself, and so much more.
[01:36:58.948 --> 01:37:00.489]  Over 12 years up and running.
[01:37:00.489 --> 01:37:02.049]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:37:02.049 --> 01:37:05.010]  When you're a member, 11 memberships for the price of one.
[01:37:05.010 --> 01:37:06.230]  Check that out.
[01:37:06.230 --> 01:37:08.051]  Great to wake up friends and family.
[01:37:08.051 --> 01:37:09.952]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:37:09.952 --> 01:37:10.572]  And starting
[01:37:11.352 --> 01:37:15.334]  Next week, we're going to be going live out of the studio either Monday or Tuesday.
[01:37:15.334 --> 01:37:19.855]  So get ready for that in the new studio and so much more.
[01:37:19.855 --> 01:37:22.936]  Thank you all for your support, all of you out there.
[01:37:22.936 --> 01:37:24.437]  All right, Dr. Baggage continuing.
[01:37:25.427 --> 01:37:34.594]  With the reports I've seen of changing up what's happening, the federal government saying they're going to be over tribal lands and that they'll, quote, help the natives.
[01:37:34.594 --> 01:37:39.497]  Well, I've heard that before, but they've already been getting screwed so bad by the state and the feds.
[01:37:39.497 --> 01:37:51.466]  From your true expert position that I know really is about helping the native groups, but also Alaskans, period, get the wealth out of the land for the people that actually develop it with their hands.
[01:37:52.247 --> 01:37:58.789]  What's really happening in Alaska and in a larger situation with the native nations across North America?
[01:37:59.414 --> 01:38:09.519]  Well, you know, here in Alaska, again, it was a unique experiment, and I worked for two of the more radical tribes in Alaska that really were the leaders.
[01:38:09.519 --> 01:38:23.725]  Tyonic Native Corporation, the leader in the Native Land Claims Settlement Act, along with the Alaska Federation of Natives, and then Chickaloon Village, which is one of the oldest established tribal governments here in terms of
[01:38:24.345 --> 01:38:24.825]  We're good to go.
[01:38:42.032 --> 01:38:48.898]  The state fails to recognize which creates huge disconnects between Native Americans and the state of Alaska.
[01:38:48.898 --> 01:38:54.262]  The feds have asserted jurisdiction over fish and game on federal lands.
[01:38:54.262 --> 01:39:01.708]  Natives really don't have control over the fish and game on their lands or the ability to run their tribal courts and be properly recognized by the state.
[01:39:02.288 --> 01:39:10.755]  So, from a perspective of Native Americans, yeah, the BIA and Department of Interior have screwed Natives over in Alaska and throughout the country.
[01:39:10.755 --> 01:39:16.960]  In fact, many of my friends refer to BIA not as the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but as Boss Indians Around.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.602]  But, you know what has happened?
[01:39:19.362 --> 01:39:30.045]  Is sort of the default is if we can at least see the possibility of natives being able to opt at their option into the federal jurisdiction.
[01:39:30.045 --> 01:39:33.086]  What happens then is they're able to run their courts properly.
[01:39:33.086 --> 01:39:35.346]  The state gets cut out of the process.
[01:39:35.346 --> 01:39:42.828]  And the state's been very adversarial to Native Americans by opposing their sovereignty, their right to exist.
[01:39:42.828 --> 01:39:45.169]  They are the economic engines for this state.
[01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:48.050]  They represent the largest corporate structures now.
[01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:51.611]  They control 90% of all private land in Alaska.
[01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:57.594]  Only 1% of the land in the entire state is privately owned with native zoning.
[01:39:57.594 --> 01:40:07.738]  So you're saying overall it's such a bad situation that the feds taking these land corporations your dad set up away basically is better?
[01:40:09.853 --> 01:40:12.356]  For some people believe so, within the native community.
[01:40:12.356 --> 01:40:13.057]  What do you believe?
[01:40:13.057 --> 01:40:18.202]  I mean, I know you don't want to speak for them, but you're highly respected by them, and your dad helping them so much.
[01:40:18.202 --> 01:40:19.824]  I mean, what do you really think?
[01:40:19.824 --> 01:40:20.625]  Your personal opinion.
[01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:24.344]  I think we need to do some kind of a hybridized version.
[01:40:24.344 --> 01:40:24.764]  I agree.
[01:40:24.764 --> 01:40:27.146]  You need checks and balances on the two groups.
[01:40:27.146 --> 01:40:31.529]  That's exactly right, because what's happening now is Interior is unreliable.
[01:40:31.529 --> 01:40:39.796]  I mean, there's a trillion-dollar lawsuits, you know, that were settled for billions because of the BIA's lack of management over native lands, trust lands.
[01:40:40.536 --> 01:40:49.680]  More authority needs to be vested with the tribal governments within these configurations and the state needs to be forced to recognize these tribes whether they like it or not.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:51.440]  They're federally recognized.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:55.542]  These people have a right to recognition by the state of Alaska and that needs to change.
[01:40:56.102 --> 01:41:05.827]  When you look at what's going on here, natives are the leaders in many of the developments going on in Alaska, where the federal government under the Obama administration have stood in the way of development.
[01:41:05.827 --> 01:41:14.951]  Alaska represents nearly 20% of the land mass of the United States, the largest coastal areas in the United States, bigger than the East, West, and Gulf Coast combined.
[01:41:14.951 --> 01:41:18.092]  We have mineral wealth that would set the budget straight.
[01:41:18.092 --> 01:41:19.293]  I mean, we have... Well, I know this.
[01:41:19.293 --> 01:41:21.414]  Everywhere the natives haven't been given control.
[01:41:22.114 --> 01:41:28.176]  It's a hell hole and they're all just basically the stereotype drinking Jack Daniels in a trailer with no electricity.
[01:41:28.176 --> 01:41:36.980]  But where you go where the natives have gotten control, up in Minnesota and Oklahoma and other areas, some of the nicest areas in the state are native controlled.
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:46.563]  So the answer is give the natives their wealth, stop treating them like crap and they'll produce wealth and actually, you know, give us something that's different than the state or the feds.
[01:41:46.563 --> 01:41:48.284]  That's what I like is more diversity.
[01:41:48.988 --> 01:41:50.029]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:50.029 --> 01:41:54.413]  And these people operate good organizations.
[01:41:54.413 --> 01:41:55.434]  They are good people.
[01:41:55.434 --> 01:42:03.681]  And yeah, there's a lot to learn in all of this because we've become, you know, international in the fact of where Alaska sits and where our commodities flow.
[01:42:03.681 --> 01:42:07.685]  They flow to the Pacific Rim, mostly to foreign buyers.
[01:42:07.685 --> 01:42:15.132]  It's incredibly important to recognize not just the sovereignty of individual citizens within the country, but to recognize the sovereignty of first people.
[01:42:16.252 --> 01:42:19.975]  They have the potential to develop governments that actually represent people and deliver services.
[01:42:19.975 --> 01:42:24.740]  Well, I would rather the natives have half of the western land than the feds having it.
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:26.481]  At least they'll do something with it.
[01:42:26.481 --> 01:42:27.022]  Absolutely.
[01:42:27.022 --> 01:42:27.863]  I mean, come on!
[01:42:28.684 --> 01:42:29.325]  Absolutely.
[01:42:29.325 --> 01:42:30.746]  And these are responsible people.
[01:42:30.746 --> 01:42:32.867]  They care about the land more than anyone else.
[01:42:32.867 --> 01:42:34.709]  I mean, this is their heritage.
[01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:37.991]  Let these people have the sovereignty they deserve.
[01:42:37.991 --> 01:42:39.172]  Let them move forward.
[01:42:39.172 --> 01:42:43.495]  Not just under the bus of the Interior Department.
[01:42:43.495 --> 01:42:46.297]  Let's find a hybridized way to accomplish this.
[01:42:46.297 --> 01:42:49.179]  I'm hopeful that my brother will continue.
[01:42:49.179 --> 01:42:49.680]  I mean, he had
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:51.221]  Strong rural support.
[01:42:51.221 --> 01:42:57.927]  He won every rural district against one of the most powerful senators in history, Ted Stevens.
[01:42:57.927 --> 01:43:02.430]  And my brother won every rural district in Alaska when he ran against him six years ago.
[01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:13.560]  Because of the family's position and his position on Native American rights, I'm certain in the next six years he'll accomplish a great deal if he's allowed to serve again.
[01:43:14.415 --> 01:43:17.857]  All right, now continuing, let's shift gears into brain chips.
[01:43:17.857 --> 01:43:19.097]  I don't want to take calls.
[01:43:19.097 --> 01:43:23.339]  And then, Wildcard, what do you want to cover in the 30 minutes of the next hour?
[01:43:23.339 --> 01:43:25.861]  Just tell me now, because I know there's a lot of issues out there.
[01:43:25.861 --> 01:43:28.262]  You cover so much.
[01:43:28.262 --> 01:43:29.843]  What is front and center?
[01:43:29.843 --> 01:43:36.346]  I'd like to get into a little bit more on the lands issues and the resources here, because Americans don't really fully recognize
[01:43:37.322 --> 01:43:52.767]  This state potentially offers us solutions that the country needs to alleviate our deficits, to create a growing, vibrant... Oh yeah, that's why the globalists don't want us getting into Alaska or getting into the West and use fake environmentalism to block it all off.
[01:43:54.029 --> 01:43:57.591]  And then meanwhile they're doing stuff in Mexico and China ten times worse.
[01:43:57.591 --> 01:43:59.431]  We'll talk about that some in the next hour.
[01:43:59.431 --> 01:44:01.452]  A plan to get this country going again.
[01:44:01.452 --> 01:44:04.633]  People say, well why are you pro-oil or pro-gas?
[01:44:04.633 --> 01:44:06.394]  You know, don't you want free energy?
[01:44:06.394 --> 01:44:09.495]  If they would let us develop all that instead of suppress it, sure.
[01:44:09.495 --> 01:44:11.076]  But we are on this economy.
[01:44:11.636 --> 01:44:18.338]  And so we're talking about realism and we'll talk to somebody who knows about it more than anybody, Dr. Nick Baggett, shifting gears.
[01:44:18.338 --> 01:44:35.003]  I'm sure you saw last week Obama come out again and say we want, you know, this brain program and announce what's been around for decades, a rolling out of brain chips, a rolling, and sure it could be great, the blind to see, brain damage, the problem is they build back doors into everything.
[01:44:35.003 --> 01:44:38.144]  What is your take on the public rollout of DARPA and the brain chips?
[01:44:38.703 --> 01:44:44.724]  Well, you know, we've been talking about this, as you know, for 18 years with you on the air and many, many others.
[01:44:44.724 --> 01:44:51.786]  The fact is, they're masking the true intentions behind these so-called great, wonderful breakthroughs.
[01:44:51.786 --> 01:44:58.987]  And while they are, this is a double-edged sword and one that will stab us in the eye and not give us a clear vision, I can tell you.
[01:44:58.987 --> 01:45:04.208]  DARPA has been involved, you know, starting with just microcircuits that would allow them to track
[01:45:04.928 --> 01:45:14.230]  Special Forces, Congressional leadership, you know the Mexican government even 200 of their top bureaucrats were implanted with chips years ago so they could track all their movements.
[01:45:14.230 --> 01:45:24.173]  These are much much more sophisticated and they go back to the idea of controlled effects which came out of the out of at least DARPA as well as the Electromagnetic Directorate of the Air Force.
[01:45:24.173 --> 01:45:28.534]  Back in June of 2004 there was an article published
[01:45:29.814 --> 01:45:31.815]  It's total mind control.
[01:45:53.904 --> 01:45:55.706]  This is the worst of the worst.
[01:45:55.706 --> 01:45:57.908]  The idea of creating synthetic memory.
[01:45:57.908 --> 01:46:07.339]  What's going to happen in courtrooms when people raise their right hand and swear that what they say is true when they can't distinguish the synthetic memory from the real memory?
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.161]  This is where it's headed, this is where it's going.
[01:46:24.626 --> 01:46:24.746]  Yes.
[01:46:39.343 --> 01:46:39.583]  Thank you.
[01:46:59.569 --> 01:47:03.733]  These are the very kind of things that we've been talking about for over 18 years.
[01:47:03.733 --> 01:47:08.656]  And everything used on the military and deployed overseas will be deployed here first.
[01:47:08.656 --> 01:47:16.222]  The microwave guns, the tracking systems, this is already... I remember DARPA, it was like 14 years ago in the Baltimore Sun.
[01:47:17.043 --> 01:47:18.784]  And it was like a science fiction movie back then.
[01:47:18.784 --> 01:47:22.026]  It was like Twilight Zone music was playing almost when I read it on air.
[01:47:22.026 --> 01:47:28.069]  They said, DARPA's practicing with different wavelengths out of cell tower arrays to calm the public.
[01:47:28.069 --> 01:47:33.132]  And then I read that on air and it sounded crazy, but it was in the news as a test.
[01:47:33.132 --> 01:47:37.754]  How far advanced is this really from the patents and the research you've done?
[01:47:37.754 --> 01:47:42.237]  Obviously, if they're telling us about it now, how far along is this attack on free will?
[01:47:43.297 --> 01:47:47.500]  They've already engaged it, both in the private sector and the public sector.
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:54.744]  To change emotional states of the population is really easy, and you can even go back to Zbigniew Brzezinski's book, Between Two Ages.
[01:47:54.744 --> 01:48:00.788]  When he was at Columbia University in the early 70s, he published a book where he talked about mind control.
[01:48:00.788 --> 01:48:01.989]  The technotronic era!
[01:48:02.549 --> 01:48:12.813]  Right, and you can look at that book, and even if people don't remember, you know, he was National Security Advisor to Jimmy Carter, he's one of the founders of the Trilateral Commission, he is a globalist of globalists.
[01:48:12.813 --> 01:48:23.897]  This guy, if you read that book today, you'd swear it was a history on what happened in terms of technology, society, and politics literally around the world, because everything he predicted came true.
[01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:24.617]  This area,
[01:48:25.337 --> 01:48:31.198]  You know, it goes back decades, but where it is now is a very, very fine science.
[01:48:31.198 --> 01:48:45.902]  We've been able to replicate various functions of the brain, be able to do this synthetically through electronic circuits, and the resolution, if you will, the ability to do this at a finer and finer and finer level increases as our computer power increases.
[01:48:45.902 --> 01:48:47.162]  So when you think about this,
[01:48:48.443 --> 01:48:51.705]  To do what the brain does, say, in 1980, no way.
[01:48:51.705 --> 01:48:53.586]  The technology wasn't there.
[01:48:53.586 --> 01:49:02.292]  To do it now, with the advent and the emergence of supercomputers, you're going to be able to create machines that think like humans, that act like humans.
[01:49:02.292 --> 01:49:05.054]  You're going to be able to download your memory set.
[01:49:05.054 --> 01:49:06.795]  Let me ask you this.
[01:49:06.795 --> 01:49:12.520]  In the 25 to 40 years ahead, depending on the technologies we know about in corporate and institutional redoubts,
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:17.342]  I see the Internet, Dr. Begich, with the billions of people that are interfacing.
[01:49:17.342 --> 01:49:23.905]  It can predict the future, almost 100% in mass movements, 97% they admit, in individual movements.
[01:49:23.905 --> 01:49:27.107]  That's almost beyond human intelligence in some respects.
[01:49:27.107 --> 01:49:35.550]  Obviously, ours is much more advanced than other ways to be able to think of new things, to have love, to tell what's good from bad, to enjoy a sunset.
[01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:42.794]  But isn't the Internet interfacing with humans, in my view, a new life form and is already artificially intelligent?
[01:49:43.618 --> 01:49:44.639]  Yeah, I would say so.
[01:49:44.639 --> 01:49:48.862]  In fact, if you really look at it, as it expands, it will never be 100%.
[01:49:48.862 --> 01:49:50.623]  That's the thing about this.
[01:49:50.623 --> 01:49:57.167]  It will never have 100% predictability because of the emotional factors and just the human factors.
[01:49:57.167 --> 01:49:59.629]  But we're going to become more and more reliant.
[01:49:59.629 --> 01:50:06.793]  And that reliance is going to lead to judgments that are not necessarily the right ones, because they won't have that human factor.
[01:50:08.873 --> 01:50:16.796]  On one hand, things are expanding, but at the same time as they're expanding, the secrecy syndrome within government is expanding as well.
[01:50:16.796 --> 01:50:18.516]  That's the root of the problem.
[01:50:18.516 --> 01:50:20.197]  Government cannot be trusted.
[01:50:20.197 --> 01:50:21.717]  My family's been in it.
[01:50:21.717 --> 01:50:24.158]  I've been exposed to it my entire life.
[01:50:24.158 --> 01:50:26.539]  The first advice that my brother would give you as a U.S.
[01:50:26.539 --> 01:50:28.780]  Senator is, don't trust any of them.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:32.822]  And that's coming from a guy on the inside.
[01:50:32.822 --> 01:50:37.766]  And the reality is, special interests continue to drive way too much of our public policy.
[01:50:37.766 --> 01:50:41.608]  And they're blinding themselves because they only care about their one issue.
[01:50:41.608 --> 01:50:44.510]  That's scientific smarts, but not wisdom.
[01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:45.971]  How does it create ripples?
[01:50:45.971 --> 01:50:59.200]  I want to come back with Dr. Nick Baggage straight ahead to talk about future trends, how do we save humanity, your phone calls, and then more on the resources of the United States and North America that could create an incredible new future.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:50:59.565]  Yeah.
[01:51:00.111 --> 01:51:04.032]  Clean water at home, clean water at the office, clean water on the go.

[01:51:29.737 --> 01:51:34.199]  More and more people are discovering the incredible benefits of alkalizing the body.

[01:51:59.813 --> 01:52:02.215]  Texas is facing a killer drought.
[01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:11.683]  For 50 years, projects which could have protected us from this were sabotaged by Wall Street profiteering and the zero-growth, anti-science Green Agenda.
[01:52:11.683 --> 01:52:14.305]  Today, these projects will not be enough.
[01:52:14.305 --> 01:52:18.149]  We need a revolution in real science to take the lid off human progress.
[01:52:18.889 --> 01:52:20.090]  I'm Kesha Rogers.
[01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:24.171]  When you vote for me on May 27th in the Democratic runoff election for U.S.
[01:52:24.171 --> 01:52:37.436]  Senate, you will be voting to put our space program back to work, to bring online thermonuclear fusion energy, and discover how the sun influences atmospheric dynamics and climate, so we can control these things for the benefit of mankind.
[01:52:37.996 --> 01:52:40.398]  We must stop this fracking nonsense.
[01:52:40.398 --> 01:52:42.520]  Shell gas is not an economic boom.
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:44.561]  It's a backward strategy for doom.
[01:52:44.561 --> 01:52:54.048]  Vote for me, Kesha Rogers, in the Democratic runoff on May 27th to reject Wall Street sabotage and ensure a fruitful and productive future for Texas and the nation.
[01:52:54.048 --> 01:52:56.190]  I'm Kesha Rogers and I authorized this message.
[01:52:56.190 --> 01:52:57.651]  Paid for by Kesha Rogers for U.S.
[01:52:57.651 --> 01:52:57.931]  Senate.
[01:52:58.976 --> 01:53:05.119]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential foreclosure situation?
[01:53:05.119 --> 01:53:08.360]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:10.181]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[01:53:10.181 --> 01:53:16.503]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:53:16.503 --> 01:53:22.406]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:53:22.546 --> 01:53:26.471]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:53:26.471 --> 01:53:29.555]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:53:29.555 --> 01:53:37.805]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:53:37.805 --> 01:53:39.907]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:53:39.907 --> 01:53:40.949]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:53:41.309 --> 01:53:50.220]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:54:12.859 --> 01:54:14.420]  Big Brother.
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:16.562]  Mainstream media.
[01:54:16.562 --> 01:54:18.844]  Government cover-ups.
[01:54:18.844 --> 01:54:20.185]  You want answers?
[01:54:20.185 --> 01:54:22.047]  Well, so do we.
[01:54:22.047 --> 01:54:24.789]  We're the InfoWars.
[01:54:24.789 --> 01:54:27.632]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:54:27.632 --> 01:54:30.134]  This is the Friday Worldwide Transmission.
[01:54:30.134 --> 01:54:33.257]  We're gonna go right to your calls in the next segment, part of the next, then...
[01:54:35.458 --> 01:54:46.412]  We'll get more into the incredible resources of North America locked up by the globalists to make all the other minerals and things around the world that they are mining in Africa and Australia worth even more.
[01:54:47.648 --> 01:54:52.071]  And why, strategically, are the globalists trying to keep the United States suppressed?
[01:54:52.071 --> 01:54:53.892]  It's undoubtedly going on.
[01:54:53.892 --> 01:55:04.598]  But, Kerry, and, well, Jim's first, and Chad, and Sue, and Chris, we'll get to all of you coming up in your different topics, wildcard topics, to take Dr. Begich in other directions.
[01:55:04.598 --> 01:55:09.101]  But the five, six minutes we've got left in this segment, what are the big future trends?
[01:55:09.101 --> 01:55:13.744]  Positive, negative, where do you see the establishment at right now in their worldview?
[01:55:13.744 --> 01:55:14.825]  What do you expect to unfold?
[01:55:16.055 --> 01:55:19.897]  I think, you know, this idea of mind effects certainly is a big one.
[01:55:19.897 --> 01:55:32.564]  We have the World Wide Internet, which we talked about in the last segment, but they're actually predicting, and a PBS special was the World Wide Mind, where every human mind was connected in the same way the Internet is connected today.
[01:55:34.085 --> 01:55:46.515]  Fundamentally, you know, I think we already are connected, you know, in some, in one sense, but I don't think we need government or private sector connecting all the brains in the world and hacking them.
[01:55:46.515 --> 01:55:56.082]  The idea of creating synthetic memory, the idea of networking all the minds in the world, this is a trend that I think we need to very carefully look at, and I think resist.
[01:55:56.082 --> 01:56:02.327]  I think the fact of the matter are there some places that even though we can go there, we should not go there, and this is one of them.
[01:56:02.327 --> 01:56:02.807]  The idea of
[01:56:04.028 --> 01:56:04.368]  Thank you.
[01:56:23.999 --> 01:56:28.503]  And I don't think it needs to be an initiative that we should be spending a lot of time and effort on.
[01:56:28.503 --> 01:56:40.334]  I mean, figuring out how to protect people from these kinds of technologies is more fundamental, as we're not the only country in the world developing... Exactly, and they already, six, seven years ago, put passive MRI scanners...
[01:56:40.934 --> 01:56:42.955]  In airports to, quote, scan brains.
[01:56:42.955 --> 01:56:45.097]  So this is way down the line.
[01:56:45.097 --> 01:56:46.778]  They're just doing it.
[01:56:46.778 --> 01:56:51.941]  And how dare you, doctor, be so extreme as to say we shouldn't all have brain taps?
[01:56:51.941 --> 01:56:54.643]  Of course the government needs to read our minds.
[01:56:54.643 --> 01:56:55.664]  That's, that's freedom.
[01:56:56.634 --> 01:56:58.537]  You know, I think we need the opposite.
[01:56:58.537 --> 01:57:02.704]  I think we need cameras in every government office to see what's going on.
[01:57:02.704 --> 01:57:10.175]  I think we need microphones in every government office to know what's going on because these people work for us.
[01:57:10.175 --> 01:57:11.897]  They think we work for them.
[01:57:12.398 --> 01:57:14.480]  This thing is upside down.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:17.383]  You want to get accountability in classrooms?
[01:57:17.383 --> 01:57:23.208]  Stick a camera in every classroom and give every parent the code to see what their teacher's doing every day.
[01:57:23.208 --> 01:57:25.610]  You want to see responsive government?
[01:57:25.610 --> 01:57:27.772]  Let's look at them.
[01:57:27.772 --> 01:57:30.274]  Turn the cameras the other direction.
[01:57:30.274 --> 01:57:32.196]  That's what we need in the United States.
[01:57:32.196 --> 01:57:33.817]  That's what we need in the world.
[01:57:33.817 --> 01:57:35.599]  We need whistleblower mechanisms.
[01:57:35.599 --> 01:57:37.581]  We need ways to get the truth out.
[01:57:38.121 --> 01:57:40.402]  And for it to be credibly dealt with.
[01:57:40.402 --> 01:57:48.904]  And you know, your show has been one of the few voices in America over all these years that have been able to do that and be consistently correct.
[01:57:48.904 --> 01:57:50.865]  Because time proves all.
[01:57:50.865 --> 01:57:58.707]  You know, we've been in this a long time, you and I, and a lot of others, and we're still standing because the facts speak for themselves.
[01:57:58.707 --> 01:58:02.328]  And what you report, what I report, is based on that evidence.
[01:58:03.428 --> 01:58:10.090]  The stuff we're talking about today, much of it was in the book, Controlling the Human Mind, that you carry there, that InfoWars.
[01:58:10.090 --> 01:58:18.613]  You know, this book is 250 source documents, most of it government and academic reports showing the dark and the bright side of this technology.
[01:58:18.613 --> 01:58:24.555]  But it's up to us as individuals to take and maintain control of our minds and our information.
[01:58:24.555 --> 01:58:29.257]  You know, the Internet, Internet providers think that they own the information.
[01:58:29.257 --> 01:58:30.397]  This is upside down as well.
[01:58:30.397 --> 01:58:31.698]  Oh yeah, they're the real NSA!
[01:58:32.818 --> 01:58:33.819]  Uh, back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:33.819 --> 01:58:37.260]  It's about our information, about our lives.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:37.540]  It is.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:38.081]  Stay there, Doc.
[01:58:38.081 --> 01:58:38.561]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:38.561 --> 01:58:39.681]  Great point.
[01:58:39.681 --> 01:58:41.442]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:41.442 --> 01:58:42.923]  Third hour.
[01:58:42.923 --> 01:58:46.905]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.208 --> 01:58:54.935]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:58:54.935 --> 01:58:58.059]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:58:58.059 --> 01:59:03.628]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:59:03.628 --> 01:59:05.210]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:59:05.550 --> 01:59:07.191]  We are what we eat.
[01:59:07.191 --> 01:59:11.854]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:59:11.854 --> 01:59:16.076]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[01:59:16.076 --> 01:59:18.638]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:59:18.638 --> 01:59:24.861]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:59:55.603 --> 01:59:58.385]  Alex Jones, on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:09.921]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.921 --> 02:00:11.521]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.521 --> 02:00:13.062]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.062 --> 02:00:17.242]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.242 --> 02:00:21.503]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.503 --> 02:00:27.124]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:27.124 --> 02:00:31.185]  Into the third hour, this is a short five-minute segment, 18-minute segment coming up, then a six-minute segment.
[02:00:31.185 --> 02:00:34.606]  We're going to your calls right now for Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:00:37.014 --> 02:00:38.715]  You guys all have questions and comments.
[02:00:38.715 --> 02:00:39.736]  He can comment on them.
[02:00:39.736 --> 02:00:48.442]  Jim, in Maryland, you want to talk about the fact they're trying to get rid of our borders and then use the groups, I guess, as a political voting block.
[02:00:48.442 --> 02:00:49.843]  I want to get Begich's take on that.
[02:00:49.843 --> 02:00:52.024]  Go ahead and make your point.
[02:00:52.024 --> 02:00:53.626]  Yeah, hey, I just want to say something, Alex.
[02:00:53.626 --> 02:00:55.847]  This country, we're done.
[02:00:55.847 --> 02:01:01.271]  The thing I don't understand is I grew up in this country and you couldn't go to Japan and become Japanese.
[02:01:01.271 --> 02:01:02.692]  You couldn't go to China and be Chinese.
[02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:05.831]  But you didn't come to this country to become an American.
[02:01:05.831 --> 02:01:07.772]  And all these people, I'm going to go back to what C.L.
[02:01:07.772 --> 02:01:10.194]  Bryant said about, you know, give somebody their comfort.
[02:01:10.194 --> 02:01:12.475]  They don't want freedom, they want their comfort.
[02:01:12.475 --> 02:01:18.378]  And they're taking all these things from us, not letting Alaska use the resources there or the oils or whatever in this country.
[02:01:18.378 --> 02:01:20.659]  Why are we not acting harder on these people?
[02:01:22.947 --> 02:01:29.278]  Yeah, you know this idea of no borders.
[02:01:29.278 --> 02:01:33.524]  The fact is the cultures of the world are too different to erase borders.
[02:01:33.524 --> 02:01:36.950]  We've got a couple hundred years to go before people are
[02:01:38.268 --> 02:01:38.528]  I don't
[02:02:08.288 --> 02:02:10.731]  No, that's what I was saying in the last hour.
[02:02:10.731 --> 02:02:12.272]  Our family ranch, we don't really own that.
[02:02:31.055 --> 02:02:31.996]  No.
[02:02:31.996 --> 02:02:32.536]  No.
[02:02:32.536 --> 02:02:36.339]  I have some property outside of tax jurisdictions here in Alaska.
[02:02:36.339 --> 02:02:39.161]  In fact, outside of our organized boroughs.
[02:02:39.161 --> 02:02:43.724]  So it's property I really own, you know, because I'm not taxed under... Wow, that's so rare!
[02:02:44.625 --> 02:02:52.169]  It is so rare in Alaska, it's one of the few places where there are still unorganized regions of the state where you can actually achieve that.
[02:02:52.169 --> 02:03:02.494]  You know, otherwise, you're really just on the lifetime payment plan, because when you're done paying the bank, you're still paying the government for land that you're theoretically owned.
[02:03:02.494 --> 02:03:05.536]  Then they can raise the property tax where you can't pay it.
[02:03:05.536 --> 02:03:06.516]  It's so sick.
[02:03:06.516 --> 02:03:07.537]  Collar, great points.
[02:03:07.537 --> 02:03:08.557]  Thanks for holding.
[02:03:08.557 --> 02:03:10.338]  Carrie in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:03:10.338 --> 02:03:10.758]  Go ahead.
[02:03:10.758 --> 02:03:12.880]  Thank you.
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:13.100]  Alex.
[02:03:15.225 --> 02:03:17.827]  I've been trying to reach you for about a year.
[02:03:17.827 --> 02:03:19.508]  I've sent you about a hundred emails.
[02:03:19.508 --> 02:03:26.733]  Well, brother, you're on the air right now.
[02:03:26.733 --> 02:03:27.794]  This seems to always happen.
[02:03:27.794 --> 02:03:31.837]  When somebody says they've been waiting a long time, I automatically know they're not going to talk.
[02:03:31.837 --> 02:03:32.938]  Sir, do you have something to say?
[02:03:32.938 --> 02:03:33.518]  Here, I'm here.
[02:03:33.518 --> 02:03:35.399]  Go ahead.
[02:03:35.399 --> 02:03:37.221]  You can look back through the emails, okay?
[02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:49.212]  We are all moving right now through a magnetic field and leaving a trail, a traceable trail, and have been for at least the last thousand years.
[02:03:50.433 --> 02:03:54.114]  I know that sounds wild, it sounds crazy.
[02:03:54.114 --> 02:03:55.935]  You're talking to the guy that can answer that.
[02:03:55.935 --> 02:03:59.056]  I had a big former bank capital analyst on.
[02:03:59.056 --> 02:04:04.718]  He said sunspots are what control economic cycles because like the moon it affects the brain.
[02:04:04.718 --> 02:04:06.759]  I'll hold you over so you can finish your comment caller.
[02:04:06.759 --> 02:04:09.260]  You say you've been waiting for years to get this out, but just say it.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:15.622]  You don't have to like, people always call up and want to be screened on air, but what do you think about this talk of this magnetic field in the galaxy?
[02:04:15.622 --> 02:04:16.082]  Is that true?
[02:04:17.513 --> 02:04:22.754]  You have tremendous impact by these fields that are usually pretty subtle.
[02:04:22.754 --> 02:04:32.117]  I mean, the word lunatic comes from the lunar cycle, which was observed, you know, hundreds of years ago, because at the full moon people recognized there was a change in behaviors.
[02:04:32.117 --> 02:04:42.260]  When you look at the sunspot cycle, it correlates to the economic cycles, it correlates to wars, it also correlates to major economic swings.
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:43.440]  That's what Harry Dent was saying.
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:45.340]  Yeah, and that's absolutely true.
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:49.902]  I mean, you can look historically at the record and you can make the correlations are really easy to make.
[02:04:49.902 --> 02:04:53.883]  The same thing is true when you look at global warming.
[02:04:53.883 --> 02:04:58.785]  It's actually, if you look at the sunspot cycle, it parallels... Stay there, sir.
[02:04:58.785 --> 02:04:59.225]  I'm gonna come back.
[02:04:59.225 --> 02:04:59.765]  I want you to finish.
[02:05:00.285 --> 02:05:07.468]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:05:07.468 --> 02:05:09.809]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:05:09.809 --> 02:05:15.092]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:05:15.092 --> 02:05:20.034]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:05:20.254 --> 02:05:23.577]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:05:23.577 --> 02:05:27.661]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:05:27.661 --> 02:05:31.986]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:05:31.986 --> 02:05:42.215]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:05:42.215 --> 02:05:44.718]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:05:44.918 --> 02:05:53.121]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:05:53.121 --> 02:05:57.083]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:06:00.353 --> 02:06:03.675]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:06:03.675 --> 02:06:06.097]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:06:06.097 --> 02:06:14.702]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:06:14.702 --> 02:06:24.929]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:06:25.249 --> 02:06:39.059]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Supramel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:06:39.059 --> 02:06:45.404]  Supramel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:06:45.404 --> 02:06:54.030]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Supramel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[02:06:54.130 --> 02:06:58.296]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality.
[02:06:58.296 --> 02:07:00.278]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:00.278 --> 02:07:10.452]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[02:07:10.652 --> 02:07:17.756]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:07:17.756 --> 02:07:22.619]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:07:22.619 --> 02:07:29.423]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:29.423 --> 02:07:36.507]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:07:36.587 --> 02:07:43.611]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:07:43.611 --> 02:07:48.094]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:07:48.094 --> 02:07:57.800]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:07:57.800 --> 02:07:59.461]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:08:12.403 --> 02:08:16.431]  Listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:08:16.431 --> 02:08:17.813]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:27.637 --> 02:08:37.105]  Okay, if you just joined us, we're taking calls, wildcard calls, just on different issues from Sue and Chad and Chris and Carrie, and that's it for the calls.
[02:08:37.105 --> 02:08:49.015]  We're Dr. Nick Begich, and we're going to talk about some more solutions, a really important solution that's verifiable to absolutely make the United States, but also the rest of the world, incredibly wealthy.
[02:08:49.015 --> 02:08:50.476]  So that's coming up.
[02:08:50.476 --> 02:08:55.440]  Dealing with energy in just a few minutes after these calls with Dr. Nick Begich, a scientist, best-selling author.
[02:08:56.522 --> 02:09:01.105]  He's one of the main land experts up in Alaska and consults with native tribes all over the United States.
[02:09:01.105 --> 02:09:02.046]  His brother, obviously a U.S.
[02:09:02.046 --> 02:09:10.011]  Senator, his dad a famous congressman who got a lot of reforms in for Native Americans in Alaska but also in other areas and he joins us right now.
[02:09:11.331 --> 02:09:14.092]  The caller said, Alex, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year.
[02:09:14.092 --> 02:09:15.532]  And people just joined us.
[02:09:15.532 --> 02:09:16.652]  I'm recapping it.
[02:09:16.652 --> 02:09:19.893]  It's the magnetic waves we're going through in space the last thousand years.
[02:09:19.893 --> 02:09:20.953]  It's different.
[02:09:20.953 --> 02:09:22.033]  He didn't finish his point.
[02:09:22.033 --> 02:09:23.053]  He just kept pausing.
[02:09:23.053 --> 02:09:30.655]  And I said, no, we had Harry Dent on, top analyst saying that sunspot cycles with wars, economy.
[02:09:30.655 --> 02:09:32.335]  We're going out of one of the peaks right now.
[02:09:32.335 --> 02:09:33.516]  It's supposed to bring us down.
[02:09:33.516 --> 02:09:35.776]  We've got the chart on screen for TV viewers.
[02:09:35.776 --> 02:09:37.717]  And baggage is like, well, of course that's a big part of it.
[02:09:37.717 --> 02:09:39.237]  This is known by police departments.
[02:09:40.177 --> 02:09:40.918]  Okay, in short,
[02:10:10.672 --> 02:10:15.875]  We are all moving through a magnetic field on an atom-by-atom basis.
[02:10:15.875 --> 02:10:17.916]  It's not wrapping around the Earth.
[02:10:17.916 --> 02:10:21.758]  We're moving through it point-by-point, atom-by-atom.
[02:10:21.758 --> 02:10:24.719]  And we have been for a thousand years.
[02:10:24.719 --> 02:10:33.324]  And with the right software and the right equipment, you can go back and you can see what really happened and hear what really happened.
[02:10:33.996 --> 02:10:35.338]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:10:35.338 --> 02:10:36.860]  That's why I'm writing you.
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:40.044]  That's why I definitely didn't want to talk to you online.
[02:10:40.044 --> 02:10:41.585]  I'm scared to death.
[02:10:41.585 --> 02:10:48.234]  But I'm telling you that... I mean, what are you, an electro... I mean, are you some type of electrical engineer or physicist?
[02:10:48.234 --> 02:10:52.078]  Because that's the argument, is that you can hear echoes of everything.
[02:10:53.294 --> 02:11:03.440]  Throughout time and space, and read energy fields like electric currents that have already passed through, or radio telescopes.
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:07.502]  I mean, are you specifically working, say, for DARPA in research of this?
[02:11:07.502 --> 02:11:09.103]  Because I know they're looking at that.
[02:11:09.103 --> 02:11:13.906]  Or are you theoretically coming up with this in your mind, and it's so exciting that you're freaking out?
[02:11:14.904 --> 02:11:16.725]  No, it explains everything.
[02:11:16.725 --> 02:11:27.931]  I ask you, sir, are you a scientist specifically that has equations or tests showing what you're saying?
[02:11:27.931 --> 02:11:28.892]  Well, send me some information.
[02:11:28.892 --> 02:11:30.332]  I appreciate your call.
[02:11:30.332 --> 02:11:36.536]  Dr. Nick Begich, that's an interesting topic he brought up, and so bring it up, you know, to speed with what you know.
[02:11:37.932 --> 02:11:46.835]  Well, this whole idea of being able to go back and read energy fields, I think that is an area that's certainly expanding in research and people's interest.
[02:11:46.835 --> 02:11:53.517]  You know, think about how information is transmitted through wireless and reconfigured in television sets as an example.
[02:11:55.057 --> 02:11:59.219]  Of capturing that information long, long after it's passed.
[02:11:59.219 --> 02:12:00.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:02.301]  I would disagree with the caller in this sense.
[02:12:02.301 --> 02:12:03.381]  It's not a thousand years.
[02:12:03.381 --> 02:12:04.262]  It's for eternity.
[02:12:04.262 --> 02:12:10.905]  We are in an electromagnetic soup produced by all kinds of natural and now man-made phenomena.
[02:12:10.905 --> 02:12:22.331]  Radio frequency energy alone is 200 million times more now in the last hundred years because of what man's introduced on the planet Earth versus what nature normally was making available to us.
[02:12:22.911 --> 02:12:35.202]  But the difference between nature and man is man can create a situation where they can direct and control that information, which gets back to that earlier subject of manipulating the human brain and human mind and human emotions.
[02:12:35.202 --> 02:12:38.846]  This is where the science is going, and this is a very dangerous area.
[02:12:38.846 --> 02:12:39.426]  Exactly.
[02:12:39.426 --> 02:12:48.995]  If sunspots control wars and irrational exuberance and everything, and increase them, then imagine what artificial systems are doing.
[02:12:49.574 --> 02:12:57.001]  Yeah, and this idea of the cell phone towers or any other electromagnetic system being used is extremely well known.
[02:12:57.001 --> 02:13:05.329]  We've been reporting on it since the first major articles, the one, the mind has no firewalls, 1998, Perimeters, US Army War College.
[02:13:05.889 --> 02:13:07.270]  Great document.
[02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:09.051]  Everything in it is proving itself out.
[02:13:09.051 --> 02:13:11.612]  It's taken from an earlier Russian report.
[02:13:11.612 --> 02:13:30.203]  I know one of the best, in fact, the top biophysicist in Russia, Alex Kabarenin, and his ideas on this perfectly correlate with what the caller is suggesting in the sense that we can manipulate human beings to electromagnetic fields.
[02:13:30.203 --> 02:13:32.685]  We just lost his Skype.
[02:13:32.685 --> 02:13:34.586]  Atoms, molecules, and eventually body.
[02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:37.294]  Alright, your Skype came back in.
[02:13:37.294 --> 02:13:44.148]  And again, none of this technology is bad in and of itself, but it's that the technocrats are clearly...
[02:13:45.407 --> 02:13:46.508]  Anti-human.
[02:13:46.508 --> 02:13:57.840]  When I look at federalization, globalization of curriculum, and they literally teach 2 plus 2 equals 5, that is an attempt to really screw kids up and to make them dysfunctional.
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:01.103]  And for me, that's really a real benchmark.
[02:14:01.103 --> 02:14:05.567]  It shows that the ruling elite are really bad people.
[02:14:05.567 --> 02:14:08.890]  And there's a mix of good people in the system as well, but the higher up you get,
[02:14:09.491 --> 02:14:14.264]  The more psychopathic, kleptocratic, disconnected from humanity they are.
[02:14:14.264 --> 02:14:15.768]  Do you disagree with that statement?
[02:14:16.776 --> 02:14:18.296]  I agree 100%.
[02:14:18.296 --> 02:14:22.517]  I mean, the thing is, is we don't need to teach kids what to think.
[02:14:22.517 --> 02:14:24.717]  We need to teach them how to think.
[02:14:24.717 --> 02:14:35.699]  Math, reading, basic skills, and then give them the tools to use their mind independent of the propaganda being packed in it and organized curriculum from around the country.
[02:14:35.699 --> 02:14:36.139]  Exactly.
[02:14:36.139 --> 02:14:37.400]  I look at textbooks now.
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:40.780]  They are designed to not work and screw people up.
[02:14:40.780 --> 02:14:43.381]  And then it turns out we have the documents that that's on purpose.
[02:14:43.381 --> 02:14:45.721]  What type of elite wants to screw people up?
[02:14:47.148 --> 02:14:49.510]  People who want factory work and slaves.
[02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:53.632]  People who want people to lay down in the street and give up.
[02:14:53.632 --> 02:14:56.895]  People who don't want us to think for ourselves.
[02:14:56.895 --> 02:15:00.097]  You know, that's the whole essence of what we are as human beings.
[02:15:00.097 --> 02:15:04.520]  We are independent souls created in the image of a creator.
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:06.041]  That means a lot.
[02:15:06.041 --> 02:15:10.724]  That means every one of us has incredible potency as individuals when we
[02:15:10.984 --> 02:15:12.645]  And feeling weak, feeling hopeless!
[02:15:36.278 --> 02:15:38.399]  And insecure, that's what Madison Avenue does.
[02:15:38.399 --> 02:15:53.543]  I had Bruce Fine, top constitutional lawyer, former head lawyer for the FCC on, who got rid of the Fairness Doctrine, and he said, look Alex, what you gotta understand is, when they attack us, and I've always known this, but when they try to suppress us, that causes innovation.
[02:15:53.543 --> 02:16:03.626]  And I was realizing, the enemy attacking us and doing this mind control, that's what my dad has always said, but it's only clicking now how right these men are, that are older than me,
[02:16:04.486 --> 02:16:06.528]  That it's going to go in ways they don't know.
[02:16:06.528 --> 02:16:08.431]  It's going to trigger us to be even greater.
[02:16:08.431 --> 02:16:13.156]  Now, for the general public, it's going to annihilate them and hurt a lot of people, and we don't like that.
[02:16:13.156 --> 02:16:23.648]  But for some of us, it's going to trigger the type of historical, physical, but also cultural mutations that the establishment's not going to be able to deal with.
[02:16:24.702 --> 02:16:26.263]  Oh, that's that's exactly it.
[02:16:26.263 --> 02:16:32.488]  We did a mind effects closed conference on this in Dallas some years ago with the best in the world.
[02:16:32.488 --> 02:16:44.778]  And what they said is we are on the edge of the next evolution of the human mind where we're going to have these anomalous capabilities and the elite, the New World Order, they are not going to be able to touch us.
[02:16:44.778 --> 02:16:45.599]  That's coming.
[02:16:45.599 --> 02:16:46.960]  That's the real revolution.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:48.341]  And that's what they're fighting against.
[02:16:48.341 --> 02:16:53.745]  That's what mind control is really about, is shutting down our capacity to reach our higher capacities.
[02:16:53.865 --> 02:16:57.428]  Well, I've interviewed General Stubblebine, the head of, you know, Men Who Stare at Goats.
[02:16:57.428 --> 02:16:59.089]  They made a joke out of it.
[02:16:59.089 --> 02:17:08.196]  But on record, what's been declassified is the problem was they would boost all these people and get them to this higher level and then they automatically wanted to fight the system.
[02:17:08.196 --> 02:17:08.957]  I mean, that's the issue.
[02:17:08.957 --> 02:17:12.720]  You boost somebody like they're going to boost their own people to fight us.
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:18.144]  Once they boost them, they're going to be at our level or higher and be more human and not want to hurt people.
[02:17:19.022 --> 02:17:20.042]  That's exactly right.
[02:17:20.042 --> 02:17:25.623]  And I think this is again, when you start to look at these programs now drifting towards how do you wipe out memory?
[02:17:25.623 --> 02:17:28.744]  How do you really start to refine what the feed is?
[02:17:28.744 --> 02:17:30.204]  And that's really what's going on.
[02:17:30.204 --> 02:17:37.106]  It's a control of the feed and to try and suppress these higher ordered capacities at the same time as exploit them.
[02:17:37.106 --> 02:17:39.707]  And that's that's the challenge for DARPA.
[02:17:39.707 --> 02:17:41.287]  And it's the it's it's really
[02:17:41.727 --> 02:17:46.009]  We need to let go of fear and worry, be confident human beings, recognize what we are.
[02:17:46.009 --> 02:17:47.629]  We live eternally.
[02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:50.030]  This is a stop between short interviews.
[02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:57.393]  We need to move forward as sovereign individuals doing the things that we believe are right and true to the extent that we each individually can.
[02:17:57.393 --> 02:17:59.073]  That's what changes the world.
[02:17:59.073 --> 02:18:01.314]  That's why talk radio is powerful.
[02:18:01.314 --> 02:18:04.795]  It reminds us that we are not in this alone.
[02:18:04.795 --> 02:18:06.196]  We are in this together.
[02:18:06.196 --> 02:18:07.176]  We can make a difference.
[02:18:07.276 --> 02:18:08.496]  Well, powerful interview.
[02:18:08.496 --> 02:18:08.756]  Amazing.
[02:18:08.756 --> 02:18:10.357]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[02:18:10.357 --> 02:18:11.997]  It's so important.
[02:18:11.997 --> 02:18:19.358]  We have this clip of this physicist Sneed and Seed and what's his full name?
[02:18:19.358 --> 02:18:20.619]  I forget it.
[02:18:20.619 --> 02:18:21.159]  That's right.
[02:18:21.159 --> 02:18:22.339]  Richard Seed.
[02:18:22.339 --> 02:18:24.819]  And this was on Discovery Channel.
[02:18:24.819 --> 02:18:28.240]  And this is the attitude of Ray Kurzweil and so many others.
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:29.160]  And they're really smart men.
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:31.281]  And I admire much of their work and their inventions.
[02:18:31.281 --> 02:18:32.401]  But the compendium
[02:18:33.416 --> 02:18:40.248]  of the futurists they put on TV, that they make the head of Google technology and future programs.
[02:18:40.248 --> 02:18:44.916]  They have this attitude of, you're not even people, we're gonna become gods, we're gonna brush you aside.
[02:18:44.916 --> 02:18:46.679]  Well, I don't think they're ever gonna become
[02:18:47.757 --> 02:18:52.901]  Even superhuman or advanced to the next level while having an attitude of shutting off other people.
[02:18:52.901 --> 02:18:54.022]  I mean, you reap what you sow.
[02:18:54.022 --> 02:18:55.383]  It's a universal law.
[02:18:55.383 --> 02:18:57.124]  Karma, whatever you want to call it.
[02:18:57.124 --> 02:19:05.631]  I don't know how these guys are so smart that they have this real anti-human attitude of me, me, me, mine, mine, mine.
[02:19:05.631 --> 02:19:07.312]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:19:07.312 --> 02:19:10.915]  We are going to become gods.
[02:19:10.915 --> 02:19:11.355]  Period.
[02:19:11.355 --> 02:19:13.457]  If you don't like it, get off.
[02:19:14.815 --> 02:19:16.196]  You don't have to contribute.
[02:19:16.196 --> 02:19:18.498]  You don't have to participate.
[02:19:18.498 --> 02:19:27.005]  But if you're going to interfere with me becoming God, then you're going to have big trouble.
[02:19:27.005 --> 02:19:29.467]  Then we'll have warfare.
[02:19:29.467 --> 02:19:30.488]  So there's the attitude.
[02:19:30.488 --> 02:19:31.649]  They've seized the future.
[02:19:31.649 --> 02:19:33.130]  They're deciding what to do.
[02:19:33.130 --> 02:19:34.611]  We don't even count.
[02:19:34.611 --> 02:19:36.493]  That's the end of my free will.
[02:19:36.493 --> 02:19:40.356]  Don't they know that that is at a fundamental level a universal crime in the universe?
[02:19:41.226 --> 02:19:46.369]  You know, I think there's... Ego is so big on the part of some of these players.
[02:19:46.369 --> 02:19:50.071]  And that's what I see as I meet many, many people in leadership.
[02:19:50.071 --> 02:19:53.614]  They either have a very humble heart or just the opposite.
[02:19:53.614 --> 02:19:57.436]  And, you know, I think eventually this all catches up.
[02:19:57.436 --> 02:19:59.998]  And I think we're in that phase of history.
[02:19:59.998 --> 02:20:04.680]  You know, there's a lot of unrest in the country right now, in the world right now.
[02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:07.882]  That's actually feeding, I think, the changes that are coming too.
[02:20:07.882 --> 02:20:09.944]  And it's the necessity
[02:20:10.584 --> 02:20:10.984]  I think?
[02:20:27.538 --> 02:20:29.239]  But it's going to be a rough road.
[02:20:29.239 --> 02:20:39.984]  These elitists that think it belongs to them, that's been the problem for at least a couple thousand years, suppressing the population so that we don't recognize what we truly are.
[02:20:39.984 --> 02:20:49.769]  If we could just recognize and remember the gifts that we have within us and believe that we can manifest those gifts, they'll come.
[02:20:49.949 --> 02:20:58.678]  And I believe that technology will lay the blueprint where our belief systems will change and we'll see these things naturally manifest in the minds of man.
[02:20:58.678 --> 02:21:04.384]  And instead of trying to suppress the general population where there's guaranteed individuals that would take us to the next level...
[02:21:05.509 --> 02:21:10.690]  I mean, the elite should see the entire population as a treasure trove instead of a detriment.
[02:21:10.690 --> 02:21:17.472]  And then the self-fulfilling prophecy that we're junk, they program us with junk so they can point at us and say, see, we're better than them.
[02:21:17.472 --> 02:21:19.013]  That's not elitist.
[02:21:19.013 --> 02:21:22.434]  That's not what a real elite would think.
[02:21:22.434 --> 02:21:23.374]  It just makes no sense.
[02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:30.891]  Well, again, as they fail to recognize the value of each human being.
[02:21:30.891 --> 02:21:34.452]  Some countries don't put any value on humankind.
[02:21:34.452 --> 02:21:42.974]  What we're seeing is more and more of that drifting into Western governments to the point where we're just numbers on a tax record.
[02:21:42.974 --> 02:21:45.955]  We're chattel on so many levels.
[02:21:45.955 --> 02:21:47.495]  But that is not who we are.
[02:21:48.055 --> 02:21:49.717]  We are way more than that.
[02:21:49.717 --> 02:21:55.163]  We are powerful individuals capable of creating change within our neighborhoods and our communities.
[02:21:55.163 --> 02:21:56.324]  Do what you can.
[02:21:56.324 --> 02:21:59.367]  Don't take on some impossible task as individuals.
[02:21:59.367 --> 02:22:04.052]  Take on the one that you absolutely know you can do, whether it's these issues or other issues.
[02:22:04.052 --> 02:22:05.714]  And that's how change happens.
[02:22:05.714 --> 02:22:07.335]  Put people's feet in the fire.
[02:22:07.335 --> 02:22:08.917]  Confront the issues.
[02:22:08.917 --> 02:22:10.238]  Provide the information.
[02:22:10.899 --> 02:22:17.043]  That's the only way we're going to see the mindset change from this defeatist attitude.
[02:22:17.043 --> 02:22:23.327]  We need to rise up out of the ashes of our apathy, claim our birthright and change the world.
[02:22:23.327 --> 02:22:24.848]  That's what we're each called to do.
[02:22:24.848 --> 02:22:26.429]  That's what we're here to do.
[02:22:26.429 --> 02:22:32.333]  And we can do it in every way, in every which way, with every small and large thing that each of us engage in.
[02:22:32.333 --> 02:22:33.914]  We don't have to wait for a group to form.
[02:22:33.914 --> 02:22:34.335]  That's right.
[02:22:34.335 --> 02:22:40.559]  And if you read the three or four books written by Brzezinski on this, who is one of the top global strategists, he's in the top five that we know of.
[02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:44.505]  That's all they talk about openly knowing the public doesn't read their books is...
[02:22:45.487 --> 02:22:47.167]  You know, the human potential is too powerful.
[02:22:47.167 --> 02:22:51.668]  They're going to take over and then we won't control the future and the life extension technologies.
[02:22:51.668 --> 02:22:54.069]  Hurry, let's dumb them all down.
[02:22:54.069 --> 02:22:58.589]  Obviously, these are not the people to lead us, that they would act like this.
[02:22:58.589 --> 02:22:59.570]  Absolutely.
[02:22:59.570 --> 02:23:02.470]  And again, you know, good leaders keep getting taken out.
[02:23:02.470 --> 02:23:06.691]  They either die in plane crashes, they get taken out in political scandal.
[02:23:06.691 --> 02:23:09.051]  You know, this is the way it's done.
[02:23:09.051 --> 02:23:11.912]  You know, you either play ball or they try and bury you.
[02:23:12.552 --> 02:23:13.053]  Uh, this is
[02:23:25.592 --> 02:23:28.254]  We're going to spend 20 million bucks, and you know where that money's coming from?
[02:23:28.254 --> 02:23:30.716]  It's not coming from citizens who live here.
[02:23:30.716 --> 02:23:34.999]  It's coming from big, multinational special interests that want to drive the truck.
[02:23:34.999 --> 02:23:36.961]  They don't want to control politics.
[02:23:36.961 --> 02:23:38.302]  They want to own senators.
[02:23:38.302 --> 02:23:39.543]  They want to own representatives.
[02:23:39.543 --> 02:23:42.865]  They want to own this country and own the very soul of the nation.
[02:23:42.865 --> 02:23:44.967]  That's what needs to be stripped away.
[02:23:44.967 --> 02:23:46.588]  Don't listen to the media ads.
[02:23:46.588 --> 02:23:47.669]  Don't listen to the garbage.
[02:23:48.189 --> 02:23:54.034]  Dig into who these people are, make your decisions based on real records and the things that are important to you.
[02:23:54.034 --> 02:24:01.500]  Whether you support the R's or the D's or the independents, find at least people that you can believe in and do something for them.
[02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:04.022]  That's the only way anything ever changes.
[02:24:04.022 --> 02:24:12.089]  And then hope they rotate out before they get corrupted because unfortunately over time, that's inevitable with so many politicians.
[02:24:12.089 --> 02:24:16.513]  They value the power more than they value the opportunity to sell it.
[02:24:16.793 --> 02:24:19.595]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:24:19.595 --> 02:24:20.676]  Good, thank you for calling.
[02:24:20.676 --> 02:24:22.858]  Hey, yeah, this is the first time I've called.
[02:24:22.858 --> 02:24:28.723]  I've been listening to you for about six months now, and I tell you what, I've enjoyed every episode that you put out.
[02:24:44.739 --> 02:24:49.801]  And I want to thank you and the other patriots that, you know, do what you do.
[02:24:49.801 --> 02:24:51.382]  And, you know, it's a shame.
[02:24:51.382 --> 02:25:01.966]  I posted a comment on Facebook a couple of weeks ago about how the United States has fallen under tyranny once again, you know, after almost 200 and some odd years ago.
[02:25:01.966 --> 02:25:03.026]  And I got called a fool for this.
[02:25:04.133 --> 02:25:07.976]  Well, there's a lot of weak-minded people that are scared, so they just say that to make them feel big.
[02:25:07.976 --> 02:25:11.759]  They also have, on record, bots that respond now.
[02:25:11.759 --> 02:25:16.042]  They already have the CIA, already has major publications writing fake news with computers.
[02:25:16.042 --> 02:25:18.984]  So, sir, don't, listen, don't even listen to the bots.
[02:25:18.984 --> 02:25:24.588]  They're getting rid of comments on most big news sites because usually the comments are pro-liberty.
[02:25:24.588 --> 02:25:28.711]  So, they're trying to create a synthetic, artificial groupthink.
[02:25:28.711 --> 02:25:30.072]  Dr. Baggett, do you want to comment on that?
[02:25:30.552 --> 02:25:32.233]  That's exactly it.
[02:25:32.233 --> 02:25:35.035]  You know, it again is about manipulation.
[02:25:35.035 --> 02:25:40.599]  So, you know, screening out and controlling the dialogue is what all that is about.
[02:25:40.599 --> 02:25:44.102]  I mean, it's the whole nature of our society right now.
[02:25:44.102 --> 02:25:47.765]  It's control the dialogue, control the debate, control the discussion.
[02:25:47.765 --> 02:25:52.128]  And every way that technology can support that, that's what's happening.
[02:25:52.128 --> 02:25:58.553]  The idea that people are giving up their private information through internet, through all the electronic forms of information,
[02:25:59.213 --> 02:26:00.473]  That's our digital doorway.
[02:26:00.473 --> 02:26:02.354]  That's the doorway to our home.
[02:26:02.354 --> 02:26:04.554]  That's what should be protected.
[02:26:04.554 --> 02:26:07.255]  We should own all of that information, not private industry.
[02:26:07.255 --> 02:26:13.056]  Yeah, I'm thinking we're going to start going to people's doors and knocking and going, why don't we come in and put cameras in your bathroom and watch you?
[02:26:13.056 --> 02:26:14.417]  They're going to like, get off my porch!
[02:26:14.417 --> 02:26:15.937]  We're going to say, hey, we apologize.
[02:26:15.937 --> 02:26:20.038]  It's for TV to illustrate that the NSA and corporations are watching everything you do.
[02:26:20.038 --> 02:26:22.879]  Why are you mad at me, but not them, when I'm being honest?
[02:26:23.618 --> 02:26:25.240]  Right, that's exactly right.
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:30.486]  And I wouldn't, I would not, you know, I mean, I've taken a lot of criticism, believe me, and I know Alex has too.
[02:26:30.486 --> 02:26:35.092]  You know, the fact is, we all take a lot of criticism when you're doing what you believe in.
[02:26:35.092 --> 02:26:39.037]  Do it respectfully, do it kindly, do it with an honest heart.
[02:26:39.717 --> 02:26:42.341]  And if you're wrong somewhere along the line, admit it and move on.
[02:26:42.341 --> 02:26:43.041]  I'd be humble.
[02:26:43.041 --> 02:26:45.424]  But exactly, don't you get empowered actually?
[02:26:45.424 --> 02:26:48.788]  When the establishment attacks you, it means you're doing good.
[02:26:48.788 --> 02:26:55.136]  I mean, when you know you're doing the right thing, people need to stop worrying about, you know, getting made fun of or attacked.
[02:26:55.136 --> 02:26:56.258]  That's what life's all about.
[02:26:56.946 --> 02:27:04.653]  Hey, you know, being raised in a political family, you get pretty thick skin, I could care less what they say if I'm speaking my truth.
[02:27:04.653 --> 02:27:06.635]  And all of us can do the same.
[02:27:06.635 --> 02:27:07.635]  Don't be in fear.
[02:27:07.635 --> 02:27:08.636]  That's where they want you.
[02:27:08.636 --> 02:27:10.478]  That's when everything shuts down.
[02:27:10.478 --> 02:27:15.542]  Know what you are, who you are, and take that forward into the world around you.
[02:27:15.542 --> 02:27:19.746]  Your sphere of influence may be your friends, may be your family, may be bigger than that.
[02:27:19.746 --> 02:27:21.007]  Exercise it.
[02:27:21.007 --> 02:27:21.768]  Do something.
[02:27:22.268 --> 02:27:23.629]  All of us are doing a little bit.
[02:27:23.629 --> 02:27:24.991]  It adds up in the long run.
[02:27:24.991 --> 02:27:27.673]  You know this, the country is not lost.
[02:27:27.673 --> 02:27:29.054]  We wouldn't be doing this.
[02:27:29.054 --> 02:27:29.955]  I would give it up.
[02:27:29.955 --> 02:27:37.962]  Listen, I'm just some average guy from Texas and I've had a big effect and I've got my problems but I'm real so it's had an effect.
[02:27:39.003 --> 02:27:49.686]  I know you've got to go soon, but I want to come back and do five minutes on the big resource issue and really how to supercharge this country and the world just using Alaska by itself on record as the model with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:27:49.686 --> 02:27:50.947]  We've got two minutes to break though.
[02:27:50.947 --> 02:27:52.427]  Let's jam in a few more calls.
[02:27:52.427 --> 02:27:54.948]  Chris in Nevada, you're on the air with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:27:54.948 --> 02:27:57.409]  Go ahead.
[02:27:57.409 --> 02:28:00.570]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:28:00.570 --> 02:28:01.430]  Okay, Chris is gone.
[02:28:01.430 --> 02:28:03.510]  Let's go to Jay in North Carolina.
[02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:04.331]  Jay, you're on the air.
[02:28:04.331 --> 02:28:06.271]  Go ahead.
[02:28:06.271 --> 02:28:07.112]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:28:09.261 --> 02:28:12.042]  I'm Jay Morrow from Great Dogwood State in North Carolina.
[02:28:12.042 --> 02:28:17.623]  I tried contacting you a couple of days ago by contact form.
[02:28:17.623 --> 02:28:24.944]  I wanted to touch on basically what the doctor was talking about as far as consciousness being upgraded.
[02:28:24.944 --> 02:28:31.405]  I'm just going to hit it on the head like a nail being hit with a hammer.
[02:28:31.405 --> 02:28:33.966]  Basically right now there exists some technology
[02:28:35.242 --> 02:28:43.739]  That has been used for I say the early 90s and it has basically been used to
[02:28:45.169 --> 02:29:00.199]  Elevate those, um, beneath the scenes, behind closed doors, um, but now it's a point where it needs to be known that this technology exists that, uh, can reverse the DNA manipulation that the government and, uh, the powers that be have been.
[02:29:00.199 --> 02:29:05.442]  Well, I know there's a lot of suppressed technology, but there's also a lot of people out there claiming they have things that they don't.
[02:29:05.442 --> 02:29:07.964]  I'm not saying you're doing that, but specifically, what is this?
[02:29:09.216 --> 02:29:22.302]  Um, basically I, um, have found myself to become a targeted individual after being discharged from the United States Navy in 2011, um, with all types of harassment, secret agents showing up.
[02:29:22.302 --> 02:29:24.403]  Oh, there's no doubt they're harassing veterans.
[02:29:24.403 --> 02:29:28.125]  I mean, that's in the news today up on InfoWars.com.
[02:29:28.125 --> 02:29:29.646]  Um, I mean, they publicly admit that.
[02:29:29.646 --> 02:29:31.447]  So I'm going to come back and get Dr. Beckett's take on that.
[02:29:31.447 --> 02:29:32.687]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[02:29:32.687 --> 02:29:37.330]  And then we're going to get into some of the solutions, uh, just on a resource-based front.
[02:29:38.010 --> 02:29:40.692]  Okay, with Dr. Nick Baggage of EarthPulse.com.
[02:29:40.692 --> 02:29:46.958]  His books and videos are all available at InfoWarsStore.com or follow the links at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:46.958 --> 02:29:47.959]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:47.959 --> 02:29:48.399]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.399 --> 02:29:49.760]  It's the Live Friday Edition.
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:51.161]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.161 --> 02:29:53.683]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.683 --> 02:29:56.366]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.758 --> 02:30:03.118]  In the near future.
[02:30:03.118 --> 02:30:07.139]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:30:07.139 --> 02:30:07.699]  Alert.
[02:30:07.699 --> 02:30:08.420]  Security.
[02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:08.940]  Alert.
[02:30:08.940 --> 02:30:10.980]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:11.880]  Analysis.
[02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:12.620]  InfoWars.
[02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:14.621]  Building independent media operations.
[02:30:14.621 --> 02:30:19.722]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:30:19.722 --> 02:30:20.762]  Prime Directive.
[02:30:20.762 --> 02:30:22.343]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:30:22.343 --> 02:30:25.243]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:30:25.243 --> 02:30:28.364]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:30:28.644 --> 02:30:32.408]  I don't know what he is except a conspiracy theorist.
[02:30:32.408 --> 02:30:35.311]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:30:35.311 --> 02:30:37.293]  They're never going to stop.
[02:30:37.293 --> 02:30:41.437]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:30:41.437 --> 02:30:44.700]  Block free iPhone app at Infowars.com.
[02:30:45.100 --> 02:30:54.325]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[02:30:54.325 --> 02:30:57.167]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[02:31:00.345 --> 02:31:04.387]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:31:04.387 --> 02:31:08.750]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:12.412]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:31:12.412 --> 02:31:15.454]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:31:15.454 --> 02:31:22.778]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:31:23.018 --> 02:31:26.962]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:31:26.962 --> 02:31:31.367]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:31:31.367 --> 02:31:37.333]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:31:37.333 --> 02:31:41.417]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:31:41.417 --> 02:31:44.020]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:31:44.020 --> 02:31:45.381]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:31:45.501 --> 02:31:46.862]  It's time to take action.
[02:31:46.862 --> 02:31:48.704]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:31:59.413 --> 02:32:03.437]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:03.437 --> 02:32:05.579]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[02:32:05.579 --> 02:32:11.524]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[02:32:11.844 --> 02:32:12.785]  We're good to go.
[02:32:26.681 --> 02:32:35.127]  InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:32:35.127 --> 02:32:37.268]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[02:32:37.268 --> 02:32:50.177]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage.
[02:32:50.177 --> 02:32:55.881]  For your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.

[02:32:59.302 --> 02:33:14.889]  To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair.
[02:33:15.484 --> 02:33:22.590]  The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
[02:33:22.590 --> 02:33:26.033]  The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.
[02:33:26.033 --> 02:33:29.636]  And the power they took from the people will return to the people.
[02:33:29.636 --> 02:33:34.120]  And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:36.041]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:36.041 --> 02:33:40.385]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:46.493 --> 02:33:53.638]  There's a couple of articles, that's from Charlie Chaplin's famous speech at the end of The Dictator, where he lampooned Adolf Hitler.
[02:33:53.638 --> 02:33:58.581]  Hitler reportedly had a hit put out on him, but it didn't come to fruition.
[02:33:58.581 --> 02:34:05.146]  Leaked document reveals Marine Corps urban training center based on US town, where they train to take on the American people.
[02:34:05.146 --> 02:34:09.629]  Another article, police now armed for war against returning veterans.
[02:34:09.629 --> 02:34:14.052]  In fact, I'm going to be covering that some on the Sunday show with
[02:34:16.351 --> 02:34:26.014]  Our returning reporters, Sergeant Joe Biggs, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and David Knight, who just got back from an Army training facility, which looked like it was set up for torture.
[02:34:26.014 --> 02:34:27.714]  That's what Biggs had seen in Afghanistan.
[02:34:27.714 --> 02:34:29.675]  He would deliver people for torture.
[02:34:29.675 --> 02:34:31.595]  Really a serious, hardcore issue.
[02:34:31.595 --> 02:34:32.896]  Obviously war turns people into...
[02:34:33.636 --> 02:34:35.356]  It turns countries into monsters.
[02:34:35.356 --> 02:34:55.320]  Dr. Begich, in closing here, spend about five minutes on what you tried to get into earlier about freeing up federal lands, freeing up lands for natives, freeing up lands for states, the amount of minerals alone that can be easily and cleanly, from what I've seen, extracted from Alaska, but is not being allowed.
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:57.441]  A. Why do you think it's being suppressed?
[02:34:58.573 --> 02:35:01.076]  And then B, break down what this could do for our country.
[02:35:01.076 --> 02:35:09.927]  And I know we'll get emails or comments by different alternative energy websites going, Alex, we thought you were for alternative energy and you're a horrible person.
[02:35:09.927 --> 02:35:11.729]  Look, they're not letting us get those systems.
[02:35:11.729 --> 02:35:13.031]  We're trying to develop them.
[02:35:13.031 --> 02:35:14.012]  We're trying to deploy them.
[02:35:14.753 --> 02:35:20.660]  Everything the government pushes is kind of a patch or an act like they're doing it to actually control the industry.
[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:26.706]  But we are based on minerals, we are based on oil and gas, and all these other things we have.
[02:35:26.706 --> 02:35:30.070]  And this could be a boom for our country.
[02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:31.492]  So talk about it as a leading expert.
[02:35:32.145 --> 02:35:37.287]  Well, first of all, you know, we're not going to convert from oil-based energy overnight.
[02:35:37.287 --> 02:35:38.927]  It's going to take decades.
[02:35:38.927 --> 02:35:40.828]  So these things are going to move forward.
[02:35:40.828 --> 02:35:52.332]  The United States has increased its oil and gas production dramatically from fracking, and now it's going to be happening here in Alaska, to the point where in a few years we're going to be a net exporter.
[02:35:52.332 --> 02:35:57.374]  Energy imports used to be about 50% of our trade deficit, with the other half pretty much China.
[02:35:58.134 --> 02:36:02.536]  That's changing because of energy production locally within the US.
[02:36:02.536 --> 02:36:14.339]  But taking it from the minerals perspective, you know, Alaska has a project that's the Red Dog Mine, which is actually a native-owned property and a joint venture of private industry.
[02:36:14.339 --> 02:36:15.440]  It produces 6% of the zinc
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:18.161]  Concentrate in the world.
[02:36:18.161 --> 02:36:21.742]  We have one of the 10 top silver mines in Southeast Alaska.
[02:36:21.742 --> 02:36:29.645]  But we also have major finds of rare earth minerals, which are presently primarily controlled by the Chinese, but not in Alaska.
[02:36:29.645 --> 02:36:42.609]  We have resources that are being drilled out and found throughout Southeast Alaska and some of the interior locations that could make America free in terms of rare earth, something we absolutely need to maintain competitiveness globally.
[02:36:43.109 --> 02:36:48.053]  We have no railroad link to Alaska, to the rest of the United States.
[02:36:48.053 --> 02:36:56.681]  We could hook up to the Trans-Canadian Railroad and start moving these bulk commodities out of Alaska for value-added in the United States.
[02:36:56.681 --> 02:37:00.404]  We need the railroad links established to get these minerals to market.
[02:37:00.404 --> 02:37:02.365]  We can't just use ports.
[02:37:02.365 --> 02:37:08.310]  We have some of the largest mining projects in the country coming online in the next 10 years up here.
[02:37:08.310 --> 02:37:10.352]  We have the Donlan Creek Mine.
[02:37:10.352 --> 02:37:10.812]  We have
[02:37:12.009 --> 02:37:17.230]  The biggest one was Pebble, which has recently been sort of slowed down dramatically.
[02:37:17.230 --> 02:37:18.711]  Anglo-American pulled out.
[02:37:18.711 --> 02:37:25.352]  That's a half a trillion dollar mine, and they still don't know the perimeters of it, and that's gold and molybdenum.
[02:37:25.352 --> 02:37:28.553]  Again, important minerals, you know, going forward.
[02:37:28.553 --> 02:37:39.956]  But Alaska has every strategic mineral in mineable quantities and strategically large quantities, world-class sizes here in Alaska, and they are not being developed for lack of infrastructure.
[02:37:40.556 --> 02:37:50.445]  Yeah, they're talking about, you know, we need roads to the wilderness, we need roads to the mining areas, and we need infrastructure built in the same way that we built the Western United States.
[02:37:50.445 --> 02:38:01.456]  That kind of initiative would not only create domestic jobs, but actual jobs that result in private industry developments and the export of value-added minerals.
[02:38:01.456 --> 02:38:03.738]  This is where we can gain our independence again.
[02:38:04.138 --> 02:38:04.498]  I think?
[02:38:25.045 --> 02:38:27.606]  We have enough coal to run the energy needs of the U.S.
[02:38:27.606 --> 02:38:30.688]  for two millennium, two thousand years.
[02:38:30.688 --> 02:38:37.711]  Let me stop you right there, because you're giving this solution, I've read that research, what you're saying is all publicly available, your brother's the U.S.
[02:38:37.711 --> 02:38:46.275]  Senator, you've managed massive amounts of land there, dad a congressman, you know what you're talking about, but it's the same thing.
[02:38:46.275 --> 02:38:49.577]  America can't have jobs, we can't have factories, we can't even have
[02:38:50.763 --> 02:38:51.984]  Service jobs.
[02:38:51.984 --> 02:38:53.946]  It's Agenda 21.
[02:38:53.946 --> 02:38:56.167]  Same thing in Western Europe and the U.S.
[02:38:56.167 --> 02:38:57.989]  We're not allowed to develop.
[02:38:57.989 --> 02:39:05.474]  We're only allowed to have government or corporate institutional jobs to capture us and enslave us under the UNESCO treaty.
[02:39:05.474 --> 02:39:12.199]  My issue is why does the elite want to shut down the United States and Western Europe?
[02:39:12.199 --> 02:39:18.324]  Why is the elite putting in policies where the West is committing suicide not having children?
[02:39:18.324 --> 02:39:19.245]  Why does the elite
[02:39:19.705 --> 02:39:25.907]  ...themselves, pretty racist people, want to destroy the West.
[02:39:25.907 --> 02:39:27.788]  Well, I think there's really two reasons.
[02:39:27.788 --> 02:39:30.809]  One is the biggest money is being made in the developing world.
[02:39:30.809 --> 02:39:33.050]  I mean, think about a developed stock.
[02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:35.631]  It's selling at $100 and it jumps to $110.
[02:39:35.631 --> 02:39:36.912]  You make 10% on it.
[02:39:36.912 --> 02:39:40.353]  Think of a penny stock going from a penny to a dollar.
[02:39:40.353 --> 02:39:41.473]  That's the third world.
[02:39:41.473 --> 02:39:45.815]  That's where they want... So they want to shut down development here because they already totally have enslaved the third world?
[02:39:46.485 --> 02:39:49.686]  Right, and then if you look at it, they look at the U.S.
[02:39:49.686 --> 02:40:10.114]  mineral resource and base as a safety deposit box, because they can leave this stuff undeveloped while they exploit everyone else in the world until they get thrown out or nationalized, and then pull back into the United States and develop those resources at the point in which we're dumbed down and numbed down, and then they can continue to rip off... I was told that by a high-level elitist.
[02:40:10.114 --> 02:40:12.015]  I've never heard that before except from you.
[02:40:12.015 --> 02:40:13.696]  Were you given that from your high-level sources?
[02:40:14.076 --> 02:40:15.357]  You know, that's the reality.
[02:40:15.357 --> 02:40:17.439]  I mean, just look at how it unfolds.
[02:40:17.439 --> 02:40:19.220]  Yeah, that's what everyone sees.
[02:40:19.220 --> 02:40:23.404]  If you really look at the bigger picture, it's just a shift in the market.
[02:40:23.404 --> 02:40:31.330]  They're just, they're going to go and exploit where they make the biggest margins and the least regulations where they can corrupt government that's openly corrupt.
[02:40:31.330 --> 02:40:34.933]  I mean, every one of these governments, even our own government, think about it.
[02:40:34.933 --> 02:40:40.818]  We have a government that takes money around the world on pallets and plane loads to bribe people.
[02:40:40.818 --> 02:40:41.599]  It's well known.
[02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:47.370]  Kidnap people, torture people, invade your mail, kick down your doors.
[02:40:47.370 --> 02:40:51.879]  You don't even know people like this unless you're listening to this broadcast in prison.
[02:40:51.879 --> 02:40:53.222]  You know, the fact of the matter is...
[02:40:53.988 --> 02:41:02.134]  This is a criminal government, and they've done everything that the elite wants to restrict us, restrain us, and keep us down.
[02:41:02.134 --> 02:41:04.115]  Because we can make the difference.
[02:41:04.115 --> 02:41:08.618]  We can make the difference in being the light that our founding fathers expected of us.
[02:41:08.618 --> 02:41:19.425]  Not to be a dominant force in the world, but to be a light where people want to emulate what we have here, what we do here, in their own self-interest, not imposed upon them by some external force.
[02:41:24.228 --> 02:41:34.270]  And they use it not just to buy off local officials, but to buy off our own military where they would give a sergeant a hundred grand or somebody else a million, a general, and then say, by the way, you stole that money.
[02:41:34.270 --> 02:41:36.771]  You better do what we say and ship these drugs back.
[02:41:36.771 --> 02:41:38.131]  This is a corrupting.
[02:41:38.131 --> 02:41:44.153]  So instead of building something to rise in society that raises the whole society, if you're part of the criminal gang,
[02:41:45.754 --> 02:41:51.618]  You get ahead, and it creates dark ages, folks.
[02:41:51.618 --> 02:41:53.359]  We need to be going the opposite direction.
[02:41:53.359 --> 02:41:55.780]  Let me ask you this.
[02:41:55.780 --> 02:41:56.761]  Are we turning the tide?
[02:41:56.761 --> 02:41:57.942]  I know there's a big awakening.
[02:41:57.942 --> 02:41:58.802]  Is it enough?
[02:41:58.802 --> 02:42:01.304]  What does your gut tell you the timeline is?
[02:42:01.304 --> 02:42:01.844]  What's going to happen?
[02:42:01.844 --> 02:42:05.106]  You're probably one of the smartest guys in general knowledge, Dr. Begich.
[02:42:05.106 --> 02:42:05.847]  What do you see happening?
[02:42:06.768 --> 02:42:10.209]  I think the tide is rising, and I don't think it takes 51%.
[02:42:10.209 --> 02:42:17.672]  The American Revolution started with 6% of the people they say were in favor of that when it began, and thank God there was that 6%.
[02:42:17.672 --> 02:42:30.077]  Today, with the ability to communicate globally, all of us, even in this broadcast right now, we can make a bigger difference if only 1% of us wake up and begin to act in what we believe to be right and true.
[02:42:30.077 --> 02:42:32.538]  It doesn't take a mass, it takes a few.
[02:42:32.538 --> 02:42:33.698]  There is way more.
[02:42:36.159 --> 02:42:42.682]  Um, uh, engaged right now that is necessary to create the next revolution, the next evolution in human thinking.
[02:42:42.682 --> 02:42:44.183]  That's what's going on right now.
[02:42:44.183 --> 02:42:45.364]  The tide will turn.
[02:42:45.364 --> 02:42:47.224]  We're not going to give up the fight.
[02:42:47.224 --> 02:42:49.646]  There are too many of us in it for too long.
[02:42:49.646 --> 02:42:52.767]  And there's too many of us coming up and be from behind.
[02:42:52.767 --> 02:42:56.609]  And I think that's the fifth column is the fifth column of freedom.
[02:42:56.609 --> 02:43:02.712]  It's those of us that still engage this process and refuse to lay down in front of the tank and get run over.
[02:43:03.012 --> 02:43:04.893]  We're going to take control of those tanks again.
[02:43:04.893 --> 02:43:11.996]  We're going to take control of this country and all of our countries because corruption is what needs to be snuffed out.
[02:43:11.996 --> 02:43:19.660]  The elite needs to be recognized for who they are and what they are and recognize that the change has to come and it is coming.
[02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:21.461]  I believe the tide is turning.
[02:43:21.461 --> 02:43:22.861]  Just keep in the fight.
[02:43:22.861 --> 02:43:25.903]  Don't give up even in the worst circumstances.
[02:43:25.903 --> 02:43:30.445]  Those are the things that give us the scar tissue to continue and the strength to carry on.
[02:43:30.845 --> 02:43:31.605]  Well, that's right.
[02:43:31.605 --> 02:43:33.546]  Beautifully said.
[02:43:33.546 --> 02:43:35.748]  Again, we carry most of your books and videos.
[02:43:35.748 --> 02:43:38.829]  Folks can also find them on your site, which I'll give people.
[02:43:38.829 --> 02:43:40.270]  Are you working on anything new?
[02:43:40.270 --> 02:43:42.131]  What are you focused on this day?
[02:43:42.131 --> 02:43:44.052]  Over at earthpulse.com, Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:43:44.537 --> 02:43:46.257]  Well, we're working on a few things.
[02:43:46.257 --> 02:43:51.499]  A few of our electronic devices are coming out in the next few years.
[02:43:51.499 --> 02:43:58.121]  We've got some really interesting things for mineral and vitamin deficiencies, diagnoses.
[02:43:58.121 --> 02:44:04.782]  We have some great things coming in the field of health, which is an area that I'm very interested in, because strong bodies, strong minds.
[02:44:04.782 --> 02:44:06.243]  And I want to work with you on that.
[02:44:06.243 --> 02:44:07.203]  I want to work with you on that.
[02:44:07.935 --> 02:44:08.435]  You bet.
[02:44:08.435 --> 02:44:13.398]  In fact, I'm hoping to get down to Austin at some point and spend a little time with you personally.
[02:44:13.398 --> 02:44:15.739]  I'm hoping to get down there sometime this fall.
[02:44:15.739 --> 02:44:16.699]  Come on down, you're welcome.
[02:44:16.699 --> 02:44:18.760]  We'll pay for your hotel, my friend.
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:22.502]  Alright, well, bottom line, look at Obama, a false messiah.
[02:44:22.502 --> 02:44:24.023]  But it doesn't work anymore.
[02:44:24.023 --> 02:44:26.644]  People wake up to these puppets faster and faster.
[02:44:26.644 --> 02:44:28.845]  And, you know, I complain that the public's dumbed down.
[02:44:28.845 --> 02:44:32.147]  Congress has as low as a 6% approval rating now.
[02:44:32.147 --> 02:44:34.108]  That's really got to worry the establishment.
[02:44:34.719 --> 02:44:35.700]  Oh, I think so too.
[02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:38.925]  You know, you're talking about the establishment.
[02:44:38.925 --> 02:44:40.287]  I got to leave on one point.
[02:44:40.287 --> 02:44:41.368]  It's the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:41.368 --> 02:44:45.934]  And you know, my brother's the only Democrat that signed on to audit the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:45.934 --> 02:44:48.798]  And when Bernanke called him and screamed at him over it, he said,
[02:44:49.739 --> 02:44:51.700]  You internally audit yourself all the time.
[02:44:51.700 --> 02:44:52.980]  What are you worried about?
[02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:54.001]  They're worried.
[02:44:54.001 --> 02:44:55.181]  People are looking.
[02:44:55.181 --> 02:44:58.642]  It's not just about what's happening in the open media.
[02:44:58.642 --> 02:44:59.382]  People are paying attention.
[02:44:59.382 --> 02:45:00.883]  By the way, it's great your brother did that.
[02:45:00.883 --> 02:45:04.444]  Tell folks, I remember seeing that briefly in the news.
[02:45:04.444 --> 02:45:06.765]  Give us the inside scoop on that Federal Reserve situation.
[02:45:07.403 --> 02:45:09.685]  Well, you know, he doesn't trust them for good reason.
[02:45:09.685 --> 02:45:11.286]  They're not trustworthy.
[02:45:11.286 --> 02:45:12.206]  There's 300 banks.
[02:45:12.206 --> 02:45:13.947]  They're a private organization.
[02:45:13.947 --> 02:45:15.669]  They haven't been externally audited.
[02:45:15.669 --> 02:45:18.090]  They need to be held accountable.
[02:45:18.090 --> 02:45:22.153]  They are jeopardizing everything in this country.
[02:45:22.153 --> 02:45:26.076]  And they're an outside institution with no audit in over a hundred years.
[02:45:26.856 --> 02:45:27.956]  It's time.
[02:45:27.956 --> 02:45:30.337]  It's time for a review of what's going on.
[02:45:30.337 --> 02:45:34.758]  It's time for transparency, both within the government and with these quasi-government institutions.
[02:45:34.758 --> 02:45:37.679]  And your brother got yelled at by outgoing head Bernanke.
[02:45:37.679 --> 02:45:38.560]  I didn't know about that.
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:40.540]  Oh, it was a big one.
[02:45:40.540 --> 02:45:42.841]  I mean, he got into a big fight with Obama.
[02:45:42.841 --> 02:45:45.082]  Obama called him on the phone over gun rights.
[02:45:45.082 --> 02:45:47.842]  You know, Mark favors gun ownership.
[02:45:47.842 --> 02:45:50.943]  He doesn't believe we need any more laws to restrict gun ownership.
[02:45:50.943 --> 02:45:52.964]  He's one of the few Democrats to do.
[02:45:52.964 --> 02:45:56.205]  Before he ever ran, he told the Democratic leadership, you're wrong.
[02:45:56.645 --> 02:45:58.786]  You're wrong on development of Alaskan oil.
[02:45:58.786 --> 02:46:00.626]  You're wrong on gun control.
[02:46:00.626 --> 02:46:02.587]  You're wrong on net neutrality.
[02:46:02.587 --> 02:46:04.127]  You're flat wrong.
[02:46:04.127 --> 02:46:06.168]  And it takes a different view.
[02:46:06.168 --> 02:46:09.529]  You know, Mark votes more with Republicans than any other senator.
[02:46:09.529 --> 02:46:15.231]  And the reason he does is because sometimes everybody has to recognize the other guy is right.
[02:46:15.931 --> 02:46:21.296]  And even if you disagree with some of Mark's politics, the fact of the matter is, he does what he believes in.
[02:46:21.296 --> 02:46:22.697]  He's willing to do the fight.
[02:46:22.697 --> 02:46:23.798]  He's willing to take it on.
[02:46:23.798 --> 02:46:26.240]  It's for veterans, which was the last caller.
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:29.944]  He's on the Veterans Affairs Committee, holding their feet to the fire.
[02:46:29.944 --> 02:46:35.348]  And I can tell you, go look at the tapes of him in committees, and you're going to see him all over those guys.
[02:46:35.348 --> 02:46:41.674]  Because veterans represent a major portion of our population, and people who kept this country safe for the last 200 years.
[02:46:43.135 --> 02:46:45.256]  It's a different way of looking at politics.
[02:46:45.256 --> 02:46:47.036]  It's not all black and white.
[02:46:47.036 --> 02:46:52.697]  We need a politics that goes back to the fundamentals of recognizing that it's human beings we represent.
[02:46:52.697 --> 02:46:54.118]  It's the people we represent.
[02:46:54.118 --> 02:47:02.000]  And we can disagree velemently about how to get to the solutions, but we need real solutions by a more cooperative and responsive government.
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:02.540]  Absolutely.
[02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:04.560]  Thank you for all the time, Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:06.741]  Look forward to having you in studio as soon as you want to come.
[02:47:07.421 --> 02:47:11.582]  Thank you for having me and I just, God bless you Alex and bless your listening audience.
[02:47:11.582 --> 02:47:14.303]  You too, what a great guy, what a fabulous guy.
[02:47:14.303 --> 02:47:18.764]  I tell you, I read all that stuff in his books in the 90s and in the 2000s.
[02:47:18.764 --> 02:47:21.205]  You will learn more in those books now than has even come out.
[02:47:21.205 --> 02:47:25.266]  And it's just, it's insane the amount of stuff that's going on.
[02:47:25.266 --> 02:47:29.367]  The admitted documents on human manipulation to suppress us.
[02:47:32.785 --> 02:47:41.011]  I mean, I'm the type of guy, if I see a lady walking outside, an old lady or a man, whatever, and they fall down and hurt themselves, I don't laugh at that.
[02:47:41.011 --> 02:47:48.896]  And then I'll be around somebody and somebody will fall down and get hurt and people laugh and I look at that person and I go, man, you're really a jerk.
[02:47:48.896 --> 02:47:52.919]  And I just don't get off on people failing.
[02:47:52.919 --> 02:47:57.642]  Now what I don't like is strong people trying to suppress me.
[02:47:57.642 --> 02:47:59.083]  I like seeing thugs fall.
[02:48:01.030 --> 02:48:06.454]  But that's normal instincts, ladies and gentlemen, and the globalists do not have our interest at heart.
[02:48:06.454 --> 02:48:13.580]  So anything they do is going to be bad.
[02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:15.321]  Makes me so angry.
[02:48:15.321 --> 02:48:20.745]  I talk about Warren Buffett constantly because he's the archetype of a guy that is the biggest recipient of U.S.
[02:48:20.745 --> 02:48:22.626]  taxpayer money alive.
[02:48:22.626 --> 02:48:23.427]  Individually.
[02:48:23.427 --> 02:48:24.188]  Look it up.
[02:48:24.188 --> 02:48:25.809]  McClatchy Newspaper is one of the sources.
[02:48:26.755 --> 02:48:30.917]  And then he's on TV every time I turn it on lecturing on how taxes aren't high enough.
[02:48:30.917 --> 02:48:39.082]  When he's an economist and knows full well you cut taxes and tax money increases going in.
[02:48:39.082 --> 02:48:42.063]  And that tax cuts is what would get this economy going.
[02:48:42.063 --> 02:48:43.784]  They don't want it to get going.
[02:48:43.784 --> 02:48:47.446]  They want to shut it down!
[02:48:47.446 --> 02:48:52.089]  I told the story going to my uncle's funeral.
[02:48:52.089 --> 02:48:53.250]  I stopped with my son.
[02:48:53.250 --> 02:48:55.271]  I didn't take my daughters.
[02:48:56.522 --> 02:48:58.523]  At Luby's in Waco.
[02:48:58.523 --> 02:49:03.087]  It's a place I stopped many times going to see family in East Texas.
[02:49:03.087 --> 02:49:06.609]  And it was nothing but old women, maybe age 65 to about 85 or 90.
[02:49:06.609 --> 02:49:10.612]  And it was a big line of these old women.
[02:49:10.612 --> 02:49:14.334]  It's all nothing but old women coming in there to eat lunch.
[02:49:14.334 --> 02:49:18.697]  I remember going to Luby's Cafeteria since I was a little kid.
[02:49:18.697 --> 02:49:21.559]  In Dallas.
[02:49:21.559 --> 02:49:25.422]  And none of those women could buy hardly any food, even though it wasn't that expensive.
[02:49:26.118 --> 02:49:46.972]  And they were all upset, and they were all trying to just live, and... It'd be one thing if we didn't have the resources, and that was going on, but the globalists have done that by screwing this economy over, and it's only the beginning of the poverty, and it made me mad, and I just know most of those old women watch TV and think Obama really wanted to get them free healthcare.
[02:49:46.972 --> 02:49:53.036]  I mean, it's the betrayal of weak people just really makes me feel angry.
[02:49:57.998 --> 02:50:07.080]  And maybe I was already emotional going to my uncle's funeral, but I just fundamentally got so upset.
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:12.042]  When I see cops pulling over some poor woman with three kids in the back, writing them tickets.
[02:50:12.042 --> 02:50:16.823]  The woman can't afford all the inspection and crap the country's going through, and I know they're going to write them tickets.
[02:50:16.823 --> 02:50:21.404]  It's going to ruin that woman's life, and she won't even have a car to get to work, and she'll go on welfare, and that's what they want.
[02:50:22.455 --> 02:50:24.856]  Not the cops, they're just there writing the ticket.
[02:50:24.856 --> 02:50:31.280]  It's just, it's just, it's just such an evil system.
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:33.501]  And I'm just not part of it.
[02:50:33.501 --> 02:50:37.003]  I got my own problems.
[02:50:37.003 --> 02:50:39.904]  But I'll tell you something right now, I'm not going to screw little people.
[02:50:39.904 --> 02:50:42.566]  It's never going to happen.
[02:50:42.566 --> 02:50:48.109]  Because the day I ever even think like that, is the day that I don't need to be on the face of this planet.
[02:50:49.272 --> 02:50:51.758]  I don't enjoy hurting people.
[02:50:51.758 --> 02:50:53.683]  And our owners do.
[02:50:53.683 --> 02:50:56.269]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:50:56.269 --> 02:50:58.575]  A couple phone calls and some key news straight ahead.
[02:51:00.802 --> 02:51:04.164]  Harvest Right is the world's first in-home freeze-dryer.

[02:51:39.359 --> 02:51:40.159]  This capitalism?
[02:51:40.159 --> 02:51:46.321]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[02:55:14.561 --> 02:55:18.524]  I mean, I'm swinging for the fences here, and I'm weak.

[02:55:34.998 --> 02:55:40.443]  But we also appreciate you giving us the energy we need to rise up and strangle the enemy.
[02:55:41.732 --> 02:55:44.194]  I mean, believe me, folks, we need to be energized.

[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:15.601]  I am committed to seeing this through.
[02:56:15.601 --> 02:56:18.843]  And if you will just commit to this, we will win.
[02:56:18.843 --> 02:56:24.807]  And it's the animating contest that separates us from the animals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:24.807 --> 02:56:25.867]  I believe in humanity.
[02:56:25.867 --> 02:56:26.568]  I believe in you.
[02:56:26.568 --> 02:56:27.729]  You believe in us.

[02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:32.652]  I want to thank all our friends and real media out there as well.
[02:56:32.652 --> 02:56:34.393]  I salute you and thank you for all you've done.
[02:56:35.996 --> 02:56:37.438]  Stephen Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:56:37.438 --> 02:56:39.400]  AP Hill, Military Topic.
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:41.182]  We're going to have those guys on Sunday in studio.
[02:56:41.182 --> 02:56:41.443]  Go ahead.
[02:56:42.705 --> 02:56:44.146]  Okay, real quick, Alex.
[02:56:44.146 --> 02:56:45.547]  I'll try to make this real fast.
[02:56:45.547 --> 02:56:53.131]  There's a couple projects just outside of AP Hill at one of the facilities that's nearby Fort Pickett, actually.
[02:56:53.131 --> 02:56:56.133]  And there's a couple things that I saw or noticed that they're doing.
[02:56:56.133 --> 02:57:01.916]  One is they're building another thing that looks very similar to the AP Hill training facility.
[02:57:01.916 --> 02:57:03.917]  It's an $8.8 million construction project.
[02:57:03.917 --> 02:57:07.359]  They're going to have buildings, alleys, athletic fields, and all that.
[02:57:08.867 --> 02:57:17.333]  Another project that they're working on, that I just found some articles on here, is a $461 million training facility for U.S.
[02:57:17.333 --> 02:57:20.195]  diplomats.
[02:57:20.195 --> 02:57:25.699]  Yeah, they're just building facilities everywhere for the domestic takeover.
[02:57:25.699 --> 02:57:31.183]  Yeah, I mean, I thought it was very interesting that they'd spend that much money to train government officials.
[02:57:32.315 --> 02:57:37.705]  Well, they just need to take more old ladies' houses, and then they can do it.
[02:57:37.705 --> 02:57:38.646]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:38.646 --> 02:57:39.107]  Great points.
[02:57:39.107 --> 02:57:40.069]  We'll look into it.
[02:57:40.069 --> 02:57:41.311]  David in Alaska, go ahead.
[02:57:41.311 --> 02:57:43.615]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:57:43.615 --> 02:57:43.896]  Good, sir.
[02:57:44.997 --> 02:57:48.140]  Hey, I've been waiting to get some information over to you here for a while.
[02:57:48.140 --> 02:57:51.102]  Number one, first and foremost, I'm a Marine Corps veteran.
[02:57:51.102 --> 02:57:57.488]  I'm also a certified anti-terror combat tactics instructor from our good friends over at DHS.
[02:57:57.488 --> 02:58:03.193]  Number two, and second most importantly, I am an Oath Keeper and I have been since the day I ETSed.
[02:58:05.206 --> 02:58:16.170]  It came to my attention that you guys were kind of chit-chatting and touching on some information about a mount, what we refer to as mount training facility over in Camp June.
[02:58:16.170 --> 02:58:17.610]  Yes.
[02:58:17.610 --> 02:58:23.292]  Yeah, well I just wanted to kind of call and give you guys some information on there about that facility.
[02:58:23.292 --> 02:58:24.733]  The facility's been built to model
[02:58:25.811 --> 02:58:26.111]  Stay there.
[02:58:26.111 --> 02:58:26.631]  Stay there, sir.
[02:58:26.631 --> 02:58:27.992]  We'll come right back to you.
[02:58:50.540 --> 02:58:54.302]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself.
[02:58:54.302 --> 02:58:57.704]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:58:57.704 --> 02:59:00.065]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:59:00.065 --> 02:59:05.327]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:59:05.327 --> 02:59:10.270]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:59:10.490 --> 02:59:13.831]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:59:13.831 --> 02:59:17.892]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:59:17.892 --> 02:59:22.213]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:59:22.213 --> 02:59:32.436]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:59:32.436 --> 02:59:34.957]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:59:35.117 --> 02:59:35.798]  Coast to coast.
[02:59:35.798 --> 02:59:36.498]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:36.498 --> 02:59:39.261]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.509 --> 03:00:10.350]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.350 --> 03:00:11.931]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.931 --> 03:00:13.491]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.491 --> 03:00:17.673]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.673 --> 03:00:21.774]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.718 --> 03:00:36.966]  The Caller is talking about a key article that we're going to cover more on the Sunday show coming up this weekend, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:00:36.966 --> 03:00:40.650]  Leaked documents reveal Marine Corps Urban Training Center based on U.S.
[03:00:40.650 --> 03:00:41.291]  town.
[03:00:41.291 --> 03:00:45.916]  They admit they're training for taking over the U.S., NORTHCOM, the Army, the Marines.
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:48.942]  With the soldiers and marines.
[03:00:48.942 --> 03:00:51.365]  But then they don't want us to be at these camps and training facilities.
[03:00:51.365 --> 03:00:56.831]  Well, I've shot video when they did this in major cities like Oakland and San Francisco before.
[03:00:56.831 --> 03:00:58.813]  And then Hebron, Maryland, small towns.
[03:00:58.813 --> 03:01:01.956]  What particular town is this base modeled after?
[03:01:01.956 --> 03:01:06.702]  We've got a lot of this classified, restricted document here in the article, but go ahead and tell us.
[03:01:08.534 --> 03:01:37.534]  Well, I can't I can't really say too much information on because I actually I have a 946 page document that's sitting inside of my house right now that kind of details a lot of this But you know I was I was up here in Alaska when we had the whole Arctic Shield and DHS came in and in the last week man There's been so many things going on up here with you know working Friends that work on base and have 22 hangars and they're reporting foreign flyovers almost three and four a month as opposed to three and four a year
[03:01:38.955 --> 03:01:40.676]  Things are really kind of ramped up over here.
[03:01:40.676 --> 03:01:47.823]  But with this Marine Corps town, we're specifically talking about a coordinate.
[03:01:47.823 --> 03:01:51.627]  I can give you the 8-digit grid coordinate for it, or the 10-digit rather.
[03:01:51.627 --> 03:01:52.228]  But it's a 63 building.
[03:01:54.102 --> 03:01:57.203]  We've got an article out about the Marine Corps base at Camp Lejeune.
[03:01:57.203 --> 03:01:59.323]  You're saying there's another town that it's built after?
[03:01:59.323 --> 03:02:00.643]  Or another secret training facility?
[03:02:20.523 --> 03:02:29.426]  We're talking about something, if you're referring to what's referred to as combat town, it's going to be a very similar one to that.
[03:02:29.426 --> 03:02:36.448]  And I think that's the one that you're... Well, I mean, listen, let me ask you as a Marine, because I've been to the drills that are public, where they admit it's for Americans, that's in the news.
[03:02:36.448 --> 03:02:39.509]  They're trying to be secretive about these facilities and the armory facility.
[03:02:39.509 --> 03:02:42.530]  I mean, are they honest with you when you're training that it's for domestic operations?
[03:02:43.632 --> 03:02:47.894]  Here's what they're training for, and here's what they tell us when we're talking about counterinsurgency.
[03:02:47.894 --> 03:02:57.718]  Now, mind you, they're training American personnel, American agents, DHS agents, for counterinsurgency operations.
[03:02:57.718 --> 03:03:03.261]  Yeah, so to be clear, the Marines are training DHS agents to take on the American people.
[03:03:05.010 --> 03:03:16.633]  Uh, I wouldn't say they're training them to take on the American people, they're training them for anti-terror, quote, quote, now use this, use this briefly, or loosely, quote, anti-terror and counter-insurgency operations.
[03:03:16.633 --> 03:03:21.515]  Sure, but when I've been to these drills, they're practicing killing guys in cowboy hats and John Deere caps.
[03:03:21.515 --> 03:03:25.376]  I mean, are they saying it's the Muslim, radical Muslims, or are they saying it's for the Tea Party?
[03:03:26.781 --> 03:03:35.990]  Um, let me use an excerpt from a DHS file that was leaked from you guys to the Oath Keepers up here in Alaska during Arctic Shield.
[03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:40.374]  The quote-unquote Americans Against Socialist Tyranny.
[03:03:40.374 --> 03:03:42.035]  Let's use that term.
[03:03:42.035 --> 03:03:43.757]  Okay?
[03:03:43.757 --> 03:03:49.542]  There's the organization that they labeled Americans Against Socialist Tyranny.
[03:03:49.542 --> 03:03:50.183]  Do you remember that?
[03:03:50.646 --> 03:03:58.990]  Yes I remember that document and again no I know they're training to take on people that don't want to go along with the end of America.
[03:03:58.990 --> 03:04:16.459]  Yeah yeah but this this whole facility here this whole facility is is very very closely stylized after a specific town that within the last two years had a pretty major incident inside of this town and like I said I'm not going to say this word because there's there's a couple of
[03:04:16.559 --> 03:04:17.099]  I don't know.
[03:04:34.907 --> 03:04:40.514]  Um, we're definitely, our eyebrows are going up and we're looking side to side like this can't be happening right now.
[03:04:40.514 --> 03:04:42.916]  Well look, it's foreign collaborators took over.
[03:04:42.916 --> 03:04:45.359]  So we've got to be honest about how bad it is.
[03:04:45.359 --> 03:04:47.542]  It's like going to the doctor and you learn you've got brain cancer.
[03:04:47.542 --> 03:04:51.607]  I mean, we are screwed, but not as screwed if we wake up and say no.
[03:04:51.607 --> 03:04:52.588]  God bless you.
[03:04:52.588 --> 03:04:54.710]  Everybody needs to speak out folks or it's over.
[03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:57.113]  We've got to admit that it's a foreign enemy.
[03:04:57.113 --> 03:04:57.974]  See you back this Sunday.
[03:04:57.974 --> 03:04:59.316]  Sorry to other callers, great job crew.
