[00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:11.187]  I want to explain something.
[00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.915]  Interviewing multiple medical doctors, Harvard medical doctors, you name it, over the years.
[00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:20.017]  A lot of articles have been written about this.
[00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:21.099]  You can look them up for yourself.
[00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.823]  There's a lot of evidence that Ebola was developed in laboratories.
[00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.732]  And then released in the jungles of Western and Central Africa.
[00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:38.838]  Larry Ford had mutated cholera, typhoid, anthrax, botulism, bubonic plague, and had also come up with germs that he called kaffir-killing germs.
[00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.022]  Kaffir, as you may know, in Afrikaans, is the equivalent of the N-word.
[00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:49.606]  So these are germs that were specifically engineered to kill only black people.
[00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:53.969]  In other words, an ethnic biological weapon.
[00:00:55.325 --> 00:01:01.148]  As it mutates, it will become more aggressive and even airborne.
[00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:12.514]  And then one of the heads of the University of Texas Biology Department, who is a global exterminist, he believes that at least 90% of the population should be reduced.
[00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:31.994]  His acolytes, his graduate students that are now medical doctors, PhDs, microbiologists, responded to us criticizing him six years ago and the FBI visiting him by sending me open letters that we published saying, listen, we will exterminate everyone.
[00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:36.369]  In fact, here's quotes from the Texas newspapers that reported on it out of Houston.
[00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:51.354]  I watched in amazement as a few hundred members of the Texas Academy of Sciences rose to their feet and gave standing ovation to a speech that enthusiastically advocated the elimination of 90% of the Earth's population by airborne Ebola.
[00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.980]  We are an epidemic waiting to happen.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.062]  And because we're so mobile and so dense, we can get on airplanes and fly across oceans.
[00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:03.183]  Disease is going to spread fast.
[00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:07.684]  And the people who've studied this, the epidemiologists... That's a common view.
[00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:11.525]  And medical people are very, very concerned about the next pandemic.
[00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:19.248]  The 2014 wave of upwards of 300,000 illegals crossing the United States southern border is only the beginning.
[00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:31.914]  He's told the world that with a stroke of his pen he will, by presidential directive, by executive order, provide legal status to five to six million people unlawfully in the country.
[00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:41.618]  Allowing any president to nullify law is a threat to the future of our republic and to the ultimate power of the people to control it.
[00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:53.024]  As Obama's failed policies, scandals, and questionable leadership open a deep wound in the Democratic Party's dwindling chances... Do you approve of the job President Obama is doing?
[00:02:53.164 --> 00:02:55.805]  Now, there'll be a chance to follow up, but this is a yes or no answer.
[00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:57.526]  Do you approve, yes or no?
[00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:01.888]  In some ways I approve, in some things I don't approve.
[00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:08.898]  President Barack Obama's administration missed their projected September 21st deadline.
[00:03:09.338 --> 00:03:09.778]  What's your name?
[00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:10.458]  Charlie.
[00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:11.278]  Charlie?
[00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:11.638]  Yeah.
[00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:12.659]  Who are you with, Charlie?
[00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:13.279]  Breitbart News.
[00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:14.719]  Okay.
[00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:20.701]  The recent story on the USCIS preparing for a surge of government IDs, do you have a response to that?
[00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:22.282]  I don't.
[00:03:22.642 --> 00:03:24.902]  I'd refer you to USCIS on that.
[00:03:25.403 --> 00:03:26.443]  I don't have any information about that.
[00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:27.875]  But it is coming.
[00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:30.998]  Leon Rodriguez, the Director of the U.S.
[00:03:31.058 --> 00:03:40.707]  Citizen and Immigration Services, is hiring more asylum officers as a greater tsunami of illegals is expected by year's end.
[00:03:40.727 --> 00:03:45.312]  So would you please tell us what is next on the President's agenda?
[00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:47.414]  The directive that we have received
[00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:56.136]  Uh, is to examine, uh, possibilities, uh, for different, uh, avenues to exercising that, uh, that prosecutorial discretion.
[00:03:56.156 --> 00:04:05.847]  Uh, I know that our secretary is in a process of engaging with frontline employees, uh, at DHS, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle.
[00:04:06.565 --> 00:04:09.326]  ...and stakeholders from a broad spectrum of American society.
[00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:10.826]  That process is ongoing.
[00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:15.127]  Alarms of Ebola infiltrating the wide open and unprepared U.S.
[00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:16.908]  southern border have been numerous.
[00:04:16.928 --> 00:04:21.849]  The immediate thing that really keeps me up awake at night, and I'll tell you it's the Ebola issue.
[00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:34.993]  By the end of the year, it's supposed to be, by the CDC and World Health and all their estimates, 1.4 million people will have been infected by Ebola.
[00:04:36.045 --> 00:04:39.006]  And probably 62% or something like that will have died.
[00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.467]  That's the percentage.
[00:04:40.507 --> 00:04:41.167]  That's horrific.
[00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:46.150]  There's no way, and we're already seeing it, there's no way you can keep Ebola in West Africa.
[00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.713]  And as hard as we will try to deal with it and snuff it out there, it's going to run its course for some period of time.
[00:04:54.073 --> 00:05:02.337]  If it comes to the Western Hemisphere, many countries in the Western Hemisphere have about no ability to deal with an Ebola outbreak.
[00:05:02.944 --> 00:05:09.780]  So much like Western Africa, it'll rage for some period of time, particularly if it gets to a place like Haiti.
[00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:19.147]  Or if it gets to Central America, there's almost no reason to stay in Guatemala, El Salvador, or Honduras.
[00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:30.929]  There's very few job opportunities, no education access, and if you're a parent, you have a better than even chance of burying your son or daughter long before they grow into middle age.
[00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.850]  So there's almost no reason to stay there.
[00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:46.668]  If Ebola breaks out in Haiti or in Central America, I think it is literally Katy bar the door in terms of the mass migration of Central Americans into the United States.
[00:05:46.688 --> 00:05:49.790]  68,000 children essentially wandered across our border this year.
[00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.573]  So these populations will move to either run away from Ebola
[00:05:55.786 --> 00:06:01.991]  Or if they have been or are in the fear of having been infected to get to the United States, will it be taken care of?
[00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:03.392]  So that's one issue.
[00:06:03.752 --> 00:06:07.075]  But the larger issue from a national security point of view is this network.
[00:06:08.296 --> 00:06:18.583]  This network that runs up through my part of the world, through Mexico and into the United States, is very, very decentralized on the one hand, but very, very efficient.
[00:06:18.663 --> 00:06:20.585]  And anything can ride on the network.
[00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:35.253]  We have a lot of West Africans, of the Homeland Security folks doing their work on our southwest border, of the number of people they capture, a very large percentage of them are West Africans.
[00:06:35.273 --> 00:06:50.437]  But there were five or six black guys that were there at the border waiting in line to pass into Nicaragua and then on the way north, and the embassy person walked over and just asked who they were, and they said, well we're from Liberia, been on the road about a week, and we're on the way to New York City.
[00:06:51.522 --> 00:07:12.673]  Illegally, so they're on the network They had flown into I think Trinidad and then met up with the traffickers and now they're on the way in They could have made it to New York City and still be within the incubation period of Ebola so I go back to this issue and I've highlighted this this issue in Washington and
[00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:23.979]  That if it is an outbreak in the Caribbean, particularly, or in Central America, it will make the 68,000 unaccompanied children, I think, look like a small problem.
[00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:34.266]  You got the CDC saying 1.4 million cases by the middle of January for two countries, but the WHO saying 20,000 cases by middle November for three countries.
[00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:35.667]  How can you be so far off?
[00:07:37.008 --> 00:07:44.091]  Well, this is another one of those areas where hubris, and I say hubris not in an unkind way, could get us in trouble.
[00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:50.894]  My answer, which is really simple, is we're just going to be lots and lots and lots of cases and lots and lots and lots of deaths.
[00:07:50.934 --> 00:07:52.134]  We don't know what that number is going to be.
[00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:54.375]  And we just have to accept that fact.
[00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:56.356]  So nobody's right or wrong here.
[00:07:56.756 --> 00:07:57.636]  I mean, we don't know.
[00:07:57.957 --> 00:08:03.859]  The precision around these estimates are, in fact, big enough to drive an entire convoy through.
[00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.940]  Is this the new Black Plague?
[00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:19.623]  It's not the new black plague, not Ebola virus, but it's very important because it belongs to a category of diseases, a category of viruses, one of which could be the new black plague.
[00:08:20.324 --> 00:08:33.354]  It's a group of viruses that live in animals and spill over into humans, and some of them cause not only terrible disease, terrible suffering, the way Ebola virus does, but also
[00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:39.798]  are highly transmissible and can leap from one person to another and could travel around the world.
[00:08:40.118 --> 00:08:45.100]  Probably not Ebola this time, but the next one could be even more serious.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:52.364]  We're finding biohazardous materials, we're finding medical stuff, needles along the border.
[00:08:52.484 --> 00:08:59.207]  The eugenicist propaganda of overpopulation has collided head-on into the looming Ebola crisis.
[00:08:59.908 --> 00:09:00.148]  I think
[00:09:01.118 --> 00:09:11.400]  The top leadership issue shown in the world today is how to deal with the continuing growing population in the world and all the resource demands and places in the world.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:22.682]  And burgeoning populations in Africa and Asia that lack the resources to have a healthy, happy life.
[00:09:22.722 --> 00:09:25.943]  And I think we've got to find a way to make the world work for everyone.
[00:09:26.363 --> 00:09:48.960]  If overpopulation, Ebola, and the economy are such an administrative concern, what I've directed the CDC to do is that as soon as somebody is diagnosed with Ebola, we want a rapid response team, a SWAT team, essentially, from the CDC to be on the ground as quickly as possible, hopefully within 24 hours, so that they are
[00:09:50.305 --> 00:09:56.713]  Taking the local hospital step by step through exactly what needs to be done.
[00:09:56.833 --> 00:10:06.345]  Then why let hundreds of thousands of illegals sneak over the border quietly in the night and give them jobs unemployed Americans supposedly don't want to do?
