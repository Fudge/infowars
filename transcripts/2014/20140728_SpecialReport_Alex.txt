[00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:14.479]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com in Cochise County, Arizona, with Glenn Spencer.
[00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:19.743]  Now, we are right on the border, as you can see, from what Glenn told me a second ago.
[00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:26.709]  They spend about $3 million every mile or so to build this fence, and yet, they have left this completely wide open.
[00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:28.130]  Now, tell me why this happens.
[00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:33.187]  Well, we're known for monsoons between really July, August, September.
[00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:34.728]  We have heavy rains.
[00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:47.897]  And what they've done here, because this is a wash, this is a low spot, what they've done is they've cut the holes in the fence and put in these gates and raised them up so the water can come through.
[00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:52.380]  Now, these are up, I don't know, usually two or three months out of the year.
[00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:54.802]  As you can see, you could just walk right through.
[00:00:56.283 --> 00:00:57.344]  Three million dollars.
[00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:01.672]  Was spent on this section and it is completely left wide open.
[00:01:01.712 --> 00:01:12.904]  I mean right here they have a lock and you can tell that someone goes to the trouble to bring a crane out here, not a crane but a forklift, lift these up and lock these completely in and it's as easy as walking in.
[00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:13.744]  That's right, you're right.
[00:01:13.804 --> 00:01:19.611]  And you can see footprints over here where people were just right here the other side and trash, water bottles and that coming through.
[00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:21.978]  It's obvious what's going on.
[00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.845]  We are now 100 yards up the fence from where we were just at a second ago where you saw the wide parts open.
[00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:32.610]  Now look, this is an area that has been cut down by the cartels.
[00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.457]  It was just repaired on 3-14-14 and it was cut open by the cartels on 10-29-13.
[00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:42.240]  Now let me show you real quick what happens.
[00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.931]  What they do is there's a smuggling route right back here.
[00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:47.274]  A truck can get through.
[00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:51.864]  They drive up here and they bring a settling gas torches up here.
[00:01:52.776 --> 00:02:05.266]  They cut through this huge fence right here, make it big enough for the truck to get through, they cut through these I-beams with a torch, and then take that down, and then what they have is a complete open route into our country to smuggle drugs.
[00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:15.334]  This is not by accident, this is a design by the Obama administration, and not only just them, our entire government as a whole has a hand in this.
[00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:18.696]  The Fast and Furious, all these things are happening.
[00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:20.697]  We make money getting their drugs.
[00:02:20.737 --> 00:02:21.678]  We sell them weapons.
[00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:23.899]  This is a huge issue that needs to be looked at.
[00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:25.800]  It's not just the illegals coming through.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.982]  It's the drugs flooding our borders to help dumb our people down, essentially.
[00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:39.347]  I mean, this is a mind-blowing thing that's happening out here, and we just need more people in America to care about this and watch what's going on and do something about it.
[00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:42.450]  Alright, here we are about a mile up from where we just had a second ago.
[00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.654]  Now, what you can see here is the main traffic route right through here for the smugglers.
[00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:49.757]  What they do is they pull up a 15-pack van.
[00:02:50.498 --> 00:02:53.201]  Now, this is probably, what, 12 feet high?
[00:02:53.641 --> 00:03:00.668]  What they do is they bring it up, stand on top, they have an I-beam to step down on, drop down to this beam, and then come into the country, and they're free.
[00:03:00.688 --> 00:03:01.329]  They're home free.
[00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.729]  Look at this.
[00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.951]  Right over here.
[00:03:04.138 --> 00:03:06.399]  There's a little barbed wire area that's easy to get through.
[00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.460]  Everybody's done it with some small little pliers.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.461]  You can just cut right through, and you're home free.
[00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:18.504]  Our government is wasting money building this fence, and all they're doing is giving them a spot to step and get over into the country.
[00:03:19.224 --> 00:03:19.924]  It's a beard!
[00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:23.986]  They're putting money... The Department of Homeland Security is saying, yeah, we have a fence.
[00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:24.946]  We have a fence.
[00:03:25.307 --> 00:03:26.047]  But yeah, look at it.
[00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:27.528]  I could climb over this.
[00:03:28.668 --> 00:03:29.508]  This is ridiculous.
[00:03:29.888 --> 00:03:30.889]  Where's the security at?
[00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:36.471]  Where is a secure border that they tell us is up, but I have not seen yet?
[00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:43.419]  Continue watching our videos because we're going to keep giving you eye-opening, mind-blowing reports down here at the border.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.622]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
