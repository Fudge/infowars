[00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:02.550]  Coast to Coast.
[00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:04.251]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:08.194]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:20.206]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:21.668]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.350]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.616]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:32.262]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:58.486]  Our reporters are on the ground in Ferguson, Missouri that's now become an international news story and threatens to engulf the country in more riots and looting.
[00:00:59.387 --> 00:01:05.950]  We're here trying to objectively break down how the police state is not good for anybody but the globalists that have hijacked this country.
[00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:13.475]  Nevertheless, though, there are miscreant forces coming into the area in Ferguson out of St.
[00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:15.776]  Louis trying to stir things up.
[00:01:15.816 --> 00:01:17.017]  We've got the New Black Panthers
[00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:19.476]  Calling for violence.
[00:01:20.637 --> 00:01:27.120]  We've got reports that our reporters have confirmed of Molotov cocktails and shots being fired.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.643]  So the police then went completely wild and began attacking everyone, including reporters.
[00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:44.910]  And then they had a late-night press conference saying that, well, unless you have a $50,000 camera, this is an actual quote, and a news van, basically, we don't know you're a reporter.
[00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:47.530]  So that is ongoing.
[00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.591]  We had our reporters there in the press conference.
[00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:57.696]  Joe Biggs literally right next to the state police spokesman.
[00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:04.860]  And they would just ignore their serious questions.
[00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:07.202]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:13.706]  The situation is obviously deteriorating quickly, but we need to look at all the other news.
[00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:22.040]  The open borders, the wars the globalists are starting, the destabilization of the Middle East, the ongoing devaluation of the dollar.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.261]  We don't have a guest on until the third hour.
[00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:28.822]  Its best-selling author wrote Police State, USA.
[00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.463]  We carry and sell the book.
[00:02:30.503 --> 00:02:31.503]  It's a World Net Daily book.
[00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:35.965]  And the book is so informative that I actually learned something from it.
[00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:38.106]  And I don't say that arrogantly.
[00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:54.337]  I'm probably the leading expert when it comes to full-spectrum analysis of how the police state really works, just because I've been studying it, reading the Rand Corporation documents, reading the Pentagon Papers, for almost two decades.
[00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:58.339]  I didn't wake up to this for a couple years on air, so maybe 18 years?
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.724]  And her book's powerful, because she's a well-known journalist that did a deep
[00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:09.103]  Research on what's currently going on.
[00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:14.087]  So she'll be joining us to discuss the police state that finally people are getting concerned about.
[00:03:14.107 --> 00:03:19.972]  And when we say police state, the slang connotation is that means not liking police.
[00:03:20.052 --> 00:03:23.816]  And that's how they've brainwashed the police that if someone talks about a police state, why?
[00:03:25.177 --> 00:03:26.138]  You don't like the police?
[00:03:26.378 --> 00:03:26.618]  No.
[00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:34.085]  What we don't like is living in a mix of North Korea and Nazi Germany meets Mexico, meets Guatemala, meets Nigeria.
[00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:43.472]  When you have tanks and police in paramilitary uniforms wearing masks, you live in a third world country.
[00:03:43.532 --> 00:03:46.055]  You live in an unstable cesspit.
[00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:49.519]  When they're rolling around with sound cannons and
[00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:52.229]  Rubber bullets and the rest of it.
[00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.551]  This is the sign of a country in deep trouble.
[00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:58.914]  Along with our giant, untenable, fraudulent debt.
[00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.296]  Along with the NSA spying.
[00:04:01.356 --> 00:04:03.978]  Along with the President operating as a dictator.
[00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:05.499]  This country is a mess.
[00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:10.823]  And we've got military police now joined by the National Guard.
[00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:27.430]  Militarized police, now joined by the National Guard, pointing guns, now into week two, almost week three, coming up, at our reporters, and being very aggressive and very hateful.
[00:04:28.431 --> 00:04:33.855]  Which, if you were even an occupying army, would not be a good bearing to have.
[00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.536]  It would cause more resistance.
[00:04:37.158 --> 00:04:42.462]  Which shows you the training is all for a perfect storm, of just disaster.
[00:04:43.462 --> 00:04:50.985]  So we'll look at all of it coming up and then Cheryl Chumlee, Police State USA, will be joining us.
[00:04:51.105 --> 00:04:55.367]  I intend to open the phones up early in this hour and take a lot of phone calls.
[00:04:56.447 --> 00:05:01.989]  For first time callers in the first hour and then we'll have wide open phones in the second hour and our guests joining us.
[00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.190]  It's all coming up today.
[00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.412]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the main websites.
[00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.315]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:43.928]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:48.850]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.970]  Talk about the effects.
[00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.771]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:53.472]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:05:53.732 --> 00:05:54.772]  I feel like I look better.
[00:05:54.832 --> 00:05:55.492]  I feel better.
[00:05:55.552 --> 00:05:56.593]  I feel sexier.
[00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:57.353]  I love it.
[00:05:57.593 --> 00:06:00.495]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[00:06:07.978 --> 00:06:09.059]  This is life changing.
[00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:10.980]  Another major health threat.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.903]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:06:15.983 --> 00:06:18.625]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:25.430]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.552]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:06:28.672 --> 00:06:31.615]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:06:31.635 --> 00:06:33.636]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:06:33.656 --> 00:06:36.518]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:42.080]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:45.802]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.843]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:06:48.903 --> 00:06:55.987]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:07:09.473 --> 00:07:15.437]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:07:15.637 --> 00:07:19.840]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.763]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:07:25.183 --> 00:07:27.805]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:07:28.105 --> 00:07:33.288]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:40.433]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:44.696]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:07:45.076 --> 00:07:49.859]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.040]  This is innovating.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:58.604]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:02.866]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:08:31.207 --> 00:08:34.828]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:34.968 --> 00:08:45.551]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:51.953]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide from Austin, Texas.
[00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:59.375]  Our reporters, now going into week number two, have been reporting on the ground from Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:09:01.957 --> 00:09:05.959]  On what is a demo for martial law nationwide.
[00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:08.660]  And our reporters have gotten video of this.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:18.704]  They can confirm that journalists are having rocks thrown at them by the supposedly perfect angel protesters.
[00:09:20.905 --> 00:09:23.246]  There are Moloff cocktails being thrown at the police.
[00:09:23.766 --> 00:09:25.226]  There are shots being fired.
[00:09:25.967 --> 00:09:28.748]  This did happen last night and it's ongoing.
[00:09:32.475 --> 00:09:47.772]  And the hoodlums that have come into the area, as the head of the state police has said, have invaded and are using all of the bedlam, like criminals do, to basically engage in criminal activity, looting, you name it.
[00:09:48.753 --> 00:09:52.497]  And they're even attacking CNN reporters and others.
[00:09:52.738 --> 00:09:53.779]  There's now video of that.
[00:09:58.257 --> 00:10:02.298]  Headline, police in Ferguson arrest Getty photographer Scott Olson.
[00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:04.078]  That's happening on the other side.
[00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:13.561]  So you've got the police arresting reporters, tear gassing them, shooting them with rubber bullets, aiming guns at them, and you've got the hoodlums attacking them.
[00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:16.021]  Truly disgusting.
[00:10:19.902 --> 00:10:26.824]  There's a lot of bullying and thuggish behavior going on, and I've likened out-of-control police agencies
[00:10:27.987 --> 00:10:29.969]  Over the years to a street gang.
[00:10:35.356 --> 00:10:37.539]  And it's so bad that I'm just tempted to.
[00:10:39.124 --> 00:10:52.659]  Pull my reporters completely out of there and just have them cover the press conferences and talk to eyewitnesses and just report on other people's live feeds because there's no point in letting a bunch of gangbangers stab or shoot my reporters.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.845]  And by the way, every time I criticize all the gangbangers with their pants hanging down around their butts and
[00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:01.726]  Running around cussing everybody and breaking out windows.
[00:11:02.207 --> 00:11:09.768]  I see comments on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and YouTube going, I knew you were racist, Alex, in all caps.
[00:11:12.329 --> 00:11:14.069]  Why are you hating on people?
[00:11:14.589 --> 00:11:17.149]  These are the type of comments that you can go to the website and read.
[00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:24.371]  You understand, I don't like the police driving around in MRAPs with sound cannons attacking the press.
[00:11:25.595 --> 00:11:27.576]  I don't like the NSA illegally spying on me.
[00:11:27.616 --> 00:11:28.917]  I don't like the wide open borders.
[00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:33.641]  I don't like the fact we're sold out to foreign banks and being maneuvered towards economic collapse.
[00:11:36.283 --> 00:11:41.867]  I don't like the fact that it's a premeditated slide towards totalitarianism in this country on record.
[00:11:42.247 --> 00:11:52.554]  But it doesn't mean that I endorse a bunch of hoodlum people showing up out of areas of St.
[00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:52.975]  Louis
[00:11:54.028 --> 00:12:03.891]  To run around and say, we've been oppressed, so we're gonna attack reporters and people, even reporters that are there spewing political correct baloney.
[00:12:05.532 --> 00:12:12.334]  It's amazing that because somebody got shot and killed, now that gives a bunch of criminals a right to loot and burn stuff down.
[00:12:13.594 --> 00:12:17.355]  I got mad when the police were shooting rubber bullets at my reporters.
[00:12:18.716 --> 00:12:21.997]  Joe Biggs, and Jakari Jackson, and Josh Owens.
[00:12:23.228 --> 00:12:25.309]  Flash-banging the car Josh was in.
[00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:32.674]  Attacking the Al Jazeera reporters and arresting the Washington Post reporter.
[00:12:33.114 --> 00:12:42.200]  While Jokari was there, they were shooting rubber bullets, tear gas, and they run up and they break down the camera equipment, chase the reporters down the road.
[00:12:43.527 --> 00:12:46.830]  And then they go on the news the next day and say, no, we were helping the reporters.
[00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:47.531]  They thanked us.
[00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:51.355]  So we went and found the reporters and they said, no, of course we don't thank them.
[00:12:51.655 --> 00:12:52.336]  It's pure bull.
[00:12:53.077 --> 00:12:55.399]  It's just a culture of lying everywhere.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.341]  It's just disgusting.
[00:12:58.683 --> 00:13:05.550]  And more and more in America, that's what we see, just where everybody is acting like a bunch of hoodlum, crazy gangsters.
[00:13:07.315 --> 00:13:09.957]  Just wanting to dominate and push people around.
[00:13:10.537 --> 00:13:11.718]  It's the end of chivalry.
[00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:13.159]  It is the end of common sense.
[00:13:13.219 --> 00:13:14.640]  It's the end of being honorable.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.601]  It is just truly disgusting.
[00:13:18.222 --> 00:13:30.491]  We have more videos of our reporters on the sidewalk and other reporters and then the police just walk up with M4s with live ammo in them.
[00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:35.484]  And others with shotguns with rubber bullets in them, five feet away.
[00:13:35.825 --> 00:13:40.448]  If you shoot somebody with rubber bullets at five feet away, you will kill them.
[00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.351]  There have been a lot of rubber bullet deaths.
[00:13:44.371 --> 00:13:46.472]  You see them in the news all the time in the back of the paper.
[00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:48.714]  Famous one was the Red Sox one.
[00:13:48.734 --> 00:13:50.996]  Remember the World Series?
[00:13:51.016 --> 00:13:52.357]  I don't know, it was like eight, nine years ago.
[00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:52.817]  I forget.
[00:13:52.837 --> 00:14:00.723]  And a girl with no criminal record, college student,
[00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:25.954]  With her boyfriend, no criminal record, not even a misdemeanor, at like 10.30 at night when they won, walked out of a restaurant, she wasn't even there for the Red Sox, and the riot police were clearing people off the street that had dumped some stuff over, and a cop, a senior one, walked right up at 10 feet away, there it is, death of Victoria Schnellgrove, and shot her in the eyes and nose, driving her eyeballs back into her brain.
[00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.271]  And the cops, you know, they're very proud of themselves.
[00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:31.752]  Oh, that's just what happens.
[00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:40.536]  You got cops with shotguns pointing them at people's heads, ladies and gentlemen, with rubber bullets, and 2-2-3 rounds that aren't rubber.
[00:14:41.557 --> 00:14:46.460]  And I... I just can't handle it.
[00:14:53.503 --> 00:14:54.584]  It makes me want to throw up.
[00:14:55.933 --> 00:14:56.994]  And the whole thing's contrived.
[00:14:57.014 --> 00:15:07.342]  You've got the Black Panthers, the new Black Panthers, which are basically a black Klan group, running around, you know, saying it's time for violence.
[00:15:07.382 --> 00:15:08.282]  I've got their quotes here.
[00:15:08.302 --> 00:15:13.046]  I've got another article out on it on Infowars.com last night that scrolled off.
[00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:13.907]  You guys print that for me.
[00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:15.548]  It's in the Featured News Archive.
[00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:26.589]  And then you've got all these other people that are just upset about their lives, upset that they don't have good-paying jobs, or the welfare checks aren't big enough, or they're scared and tired of being pushed around by the cops.
[00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:37.918]  They're out protesting, and then just mixed in with it are all these hoodlums.
[00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:45.684]  And I'm just sick of the hoodlum culture that's sold and promoted by MTV and the radio and the culture.
[00:15:46.664 --> 00:15:48.925]  Across the board, it's not just inner city blacks.
[00:15:49.505 --> 00:16:03.268]  There's all sorts of versions of weird, bully, fake tough guy, weird country rap, and weird hoodlum rock and roll, and just a culture of just trashing us.
[00:16:04.668 --> 00:16:13.450]  Men who aren't men, men that never had dads around, people that just think acting like thugs is tough and is cool.
[00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:16.071]  We've got some of those clips coming up.
[00:16:17.762 --> 00:16:26.568]  And I see the hoodlums with masks on their faces covering up who they are, and the police doing it, and just the rudeness.
[00:16:34.653 --> 00:16:39.156]  It freaks me out because what's going to happen when the dollar fully devalues?
[00:16:40.617 --> 00:16:44.020]  What's going to happen as the industrial base sinks even faster?
[00:16:45.544 --> 00:16:56.351]  And we've got people that are third, fourth, fifth generation living on welfare in the countryside, in the inner cities, everywhere, who don't know how to provide for themselves.
[00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:10.781]  What's going to happen during this flux where the robots replace the humans with most jobs from custodial positions to factory jobs to driverless cars?
[00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:27.744]  What's going to happen is the designed implosion of society, and I liken it to a Mars mission that takes a year there, six months on the ground, and a year back.
[00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:33.630]  The reason they haven't launched a Mars mission is because it's cost prohibitive, but also
[00:17:34.608 --> 00:17:59.117]  Because most of the people that go will probably end up having heart attacks once they get there or on the way back, because no matter how much exercise they do, even if it's a spacecraft that's spinning, that creates some centrifugal force and some gravity, the people will be like invalids once they return to Earth, even if they survive.
[00:18:02.864 --> 00:18:04.145]  You say, what's that have to do with this?
[00:18:04.726 --> 00:18:25.166]  We are immersed in a whole new culture of GMO and electrical frequency pollution and chemicals in the food and water and hundreds of hours a week for many people, for a lot of folks, 30, 40, 50 hours a week of television and screen time
[00:18:26.889 --> 00:18:28.671]  And you can see the IQs dropping.
[00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:33.757]  You can see the numbers of diseases and illnesses skyrocketing.
[00:18:34.217 --> 00:18:41.004]  You can see the mutation and the de-evolution of humanity in front of everyone.
[00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:43.187]  The degeneration.
[00:18:46.465 --> 00:18:56.271]  I think about the people I knew when I was a little kid in the countryside that were super hard-working, super good-looking, super tough, super cool.
[00:18:57.232 --> 00:19:04.516]  And now I go back to where my family's from, and it looks like people that are still alive there or haven't moved out have been hit by mutation rays.
[00:19:04.896 --> 00:19:07.118]  And all they do is watch satellite TV all day.
[00:19:07.458 --> 00:19:10.720]  If they even have a job in town, it's at a prison or at a power plant.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:16.023]  And there's no culture, and they are literally just waiting to die.
[00:19:21.641 --> 00:19:35.506]  And I see the young people, not even so much my family, but just the locals, and they look like absolute hell, and never even basically get out of their pajamas all day long, even if they go to a job.
[00:19:36.527 --> 00:19:39.668]  And then I see the inner city people, they're just exactly the same thing.
[00:19:40.308 --> 00:19:42.309]  It's not that I'm putting them down because they're black.
[00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:45.010]  It's like I'm not putting down white people in East Texas.
[00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:50.192]  They look and talk and act like hell, and have been turned into trash!
[00:19:51.587 --> 00:19:52.628]  And it's disgusting!
[00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.250]  And it's getting worse!
[00:19:56.892 --> 00:20:02.397]  And the system's greasing the skids to make it as bad as they can and write all these textbooks admitting it.
[00:20:02.617 --> 00:20:06.241]  That they've dumbed everyone down to bring us into world government.
[00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:09.143]  And the endgame is forced population reduction.
[00:20:10.054 --> 00:20:15.378]  American gardeners and fellow Patriots make the right choice with your money, time, and your family food supply.

[00:20:33.891 --> 00:20:37.053]  You could buy three Survival Seed Vaults for less than one of theirs.

[00:21:09.753 --> 00:21:10.994]  Another major health threat.
[00:21:11.014 --> 00:21:15.917]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:21:15.977 --> 00:21:18.639]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:25.463]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:21:25.703 --> 00:21:28.585]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:21:28.605 --> 00:21:31.627]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:21:31.647 --> 00:21:33.648]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:36.550]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:42.094]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:21:42.314 --> 00:21:45.817]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:48.800]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.063]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.

[00:22:09.478 --> 00:22:12.060]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.203]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.

[00:22:20.567 --> 00:22:23.369]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.

[00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:27.672]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:22:27.832 --> 00:22:33.156]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:22:33.396 --> 00:22:37.019]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[00:22:37.179 --> 00:22:38.260]  That's SilverLungs.com.

[00:23:08.621 --> 00:23:10.442]  Adam Miller here with Midas Resources.
[00:23:10.582 --> 00:23:11.923]  Today, August 18th, 2014, gold opened at $1297.60.
[00:23:11.983 --> 00:23:15.706]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $1344.77, $672.38 for a half ounce, or $336.19 for a quarter ounce.
[00:23:15.726 --> 00:23:16.186]  That's $1344.77, $672.38, and $336.19.
[00:23:30.536 --> 00:23:31.638]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:31.698 --> 00:23:36.364]  Have you ever wondered why bank, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:36.764 --> 00:23:37.385]  Wait a sec.
[00:23:37.605 --> 00:23:41.571]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next debt increase.
[00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:43.153]  And there's no end to this madness.
[00:23:43.413 --> 00:23:48.379]  That old 401k and IRA can be converted into physical gold without tax consequences.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.442]  I explained this in my book, 10 Reasons to Buy Gold.
[00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:52.923]  Don't let time slip away.
[00:23:53.023 --> 00:23:54.285]  Call for a free copy today.
[00:23:54.305 --> 00:23:54.345]  800-686-2237.
[00:23:54.365 --> 00:23:56.566]  Get away from that Washington spin and get honest answers about gold.
[00:23:56.586 --> 00:23:56.646]  800-686-2237.
[00:23:56.666 --> 00:23:57.407]  The book is free.
[00:23:57.427 --> 00:23:57.467]  800-686-2237.
[00:24:48.317 --> 00:24:49.478]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:51.499 --> 00:25:02.808]  I was trying to draw the parallel of the analogy to the unnaturalness of humans in zero gravity and how that's prohibitive to long-term
[00:25:04.722 --> 00:25:07.084]  Or long-duration missions in space.
[00:25:07.744 --> 00:25:22.996]  And I was likening it to the artificial environment we're in, with the smartphones, and the electromagnetic frequencies, and the GMO, and the chemicals, and the psychological warfare, and the cultural breakdown, and also the easiness of life.
[00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:41.650]  Compared to what it used to be, you get a welfare check, you can go get food even though it's GMO crud, you can lay around and watch Judge Judy all day, you can lay around and watch Oprah Winfrey all day, and then see stories of the rich and famous and have class envy of people that have yachts and helicopters.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:56.507]  And then you go to the shopping mall and you see the folks that are exercising, you see the middle class that's got money, and that's got money to not eat GMO, and they look healthy, whether they're black or white or Hispanic, and you are envious of them.
[00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:57.968]  You hate them.
[00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:07.253]  And that's what you see when the dumbed-down country folks come into town in the big city and see the beautiful people.
[00:26:08.394 --> 00:26:11.776]  In the elite areas of town, they get freaked out, they get insecure.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:31.173]  That's what happens when you get the dumbed-down, poisoned inner-city people struggling to try to make it as well, but born into an artificial, sick culture where we abort millions of children a year and just say they're not humans, not even knowing any better.
[00:26:32.534 --> 00:26:40.499]  So I don't sit up here and look at poor, pathetic country people, whether they be black or white or Hispanic, and look down my nose at them.
[00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:47.224]  I don't look at poor inner-city black people, dumbed down, ignorant, brought up in the system.
[00:26:48.185 --> 00:26:49.166]  I feel sorry for them.
[00:26:49.426 --> 00:26:54.010]  But at the same time, they have been forged into a political weapon.
[00:26:55.432 --> 00:27:04.299]  Just like the poor people pouring in from Nicaragua and El Salvador and Guatemala, some of the most dangerous, broken places in the world.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.862]  A poisonous transfusion.
[00:27:09.415 --> 00:27:18.377]  Signing them on to the Democratic Party and the welfare class to be the new political enforcer class in this country.
[00:27:20.397 --> 00:27:22.478]  You can see what the technocracy is doing.
[00:27:22.978 --> 00:27:36.281]  Shipping in unlimited numbers of Somalis into Minnesota, into New York, into Las Vegas to take over the cab businesses.
[00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:38.041]  I'm not against the Somali people.
[00:27:39.073 --> 00:27:43.415]  But you talk about coming from somewhere with a total breakdown of society.
[00:27:44.075 --> 00:27:48.357]  An absolute Stone Age level barbarism and culture.
[00:27:49.117 --> 00:27:51.779]  And women treated worse than animals.
[00:27:53.699 --> 00:27:54.900]  And it's politically correct.
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.661]  Oh, what a neat culture!
[00:27:56.961 --> 00:27:57.901]  Let's adopt it!
[00:27:58.221 --> 00:27:59.122]  Oh my gosh!
[00:27:59.722 --> 00:28:01.003]  You're wearing Levi's.
[00:28:01.043 --> 00:28:02.643]  You're a white guy driving a truck.
[00:28:02.964 --> 00:28:05.745]  That's sick and racist and homophobic.
[00:28:06.085 --> 00:28:07.946]  I bet you don't know how to read the New York Times.
[00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:11.898]  Oh my gosh, look at the white man, how bad he is.
[00:28:11.938 --> 00:28:13.379]  But, oh!
[00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.881]  Oh, you're from Somalia or Sudan?
[00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:20.723]  Where they sexually mutilate the girls and don't let them out of the house?
[00:28:21.303 --> 00:28:23.845]  And then we can chain women up in houses here in America?
[00:28:24.185 --> 00:28:25.506]  Oh, that's their culture!
[00:28:25.946 --> 00:28:35.492]  Well, my culture is owning guns, and treating women good, and having private property, and being wealthy, and being successful, and not being treated like a slave by the police!
[00:28:36.252 --> 00:28:37.013]  And I'm uppity!
[00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:38.935]  And I'm not gonna back down.
[00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:40.316]  And I'm not gonna be pushed around.
[00:28:40.517 --> 00:28:42.499]  And that's why the police treat me with respect.
[00:28:42.779 --> 00:28:45.342]  Because they know I'll take them to court.
[00:28:46.603 --> 00:28:48.005]  They know I'll stand up to them.
[00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:50.699]  They want to be my servant?
[00:28:50.939 --> 00:28:52.940]  They want to be a defender of the Constitution?
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.680]  I'll support them!
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.700]  I'll admire them!
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.322]  They want to turn into paramilitary thugs shitting on top of rotting country full of a bunch of dumbed down trash?
[00:29:01.262 --> 00:29:03.562]  I'm not going to be treated like all the trash!
[00:29:04.002 --> 00:29:05.543]  I'm not going to lay down in the gutter!
[00:29:05.823 --> 00:29:07.343]  I'm not going to be run over anymore!
[00:29:07.563 --> 00:29:11.264]  I'm not going to have bureaucrats come in my house or come in my office without warrants!
[00:29:11.644 --> 00:29:14.645]  I'm not going to kiss up to uniforms and badges!
[00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:18.897]  All that is is like ancients wearing headdresses or crowns.
[00:29:19.598 --> 00:29:20.739]  I don't like the Queen of England.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.202]  I'm not going to bow down to her if she walked by.
[00:29:24.483 --> 00:29:27.305]  They invited me to go meet the Queen of England but said I had to bow to her.
[00:29:27.626 --> 00:29:34.933]  That woman living off the people of England and her family, a bunch of usurpers for hundreds of years, make me want to throw up!
[00:29:36.577 --> 00:29:43.206]  All of your ceremonial outfits, all of your headdresses, all of your costumes, all of it don't mean jack crap.
[00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:49.455]  If they don't symbolize the Republic and freedom, then I'm all for symbols.
[00:29:50.096 --> 00:29:51.918]  Symbols are power, Moulin Lambe.
[00:29:52.839 --> 00:30:02.194]  I'll wear a decoration of a nickel belt buckle that celebrates men not turning their guns in, or their weapons in, in the face of tyrants.
[00:30:02.234 --> 00:30:07.742]  Whether it be the leader of Babylon, King George III, or Santa Ana of Mexico!
[00:30:09.833 --> 00:30:16.897]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:30:16.997 --> 00:30:19.158]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:30:19.338 --> 00:30:24.441]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:30:24.621 --> 00:30:29.584]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:32.846]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:30:33.106 --> 00:30:36.968]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:30:37.188 --> 00:30:41.430]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:51.536]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:30:51.736 --> 00:30:54.257]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:30:55.298 --> 00:31:02.503]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:31:02.643 --> 00:31:06.605]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:16.029]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:31:16.229 --> 00:31:20.413]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:31:20.793 --> 00:31:25.358]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:31:25.758 --> 00:31:28.380]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:33.882]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:31:34.143 --> 00:31:41.006]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:31:41.527 --> 00:31:45.289]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:50.451]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:50.771 --> 00:31:51.632]  This is innovating.
[00:31:51.912 --> 00:31:59.195]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:03.437]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:32:03.637 --> 00:32:09.120]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:10.623 --> 00:32:11.664]  In the near future.
[00:32:11.944 --> 00:32:15.606]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:32:15.626 --> 00:32:16.107]  Security alert.
[00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:17.467]  Security alert.
[00:32:17.688 --> 00:32:19.429]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:32:19.689 --> 00:32:20.309]  Analysis.
[00:32:20.569 --> 00:32:21.210]  InfoWars.
[00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.371]  Building independent media operations.
[00:32:23.391 --> 00:32:28.254]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:32:28.274 --> 00:32:29.255]  Prime Directive.
[00:32:29.315 --> 00:32:30.756]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:32:30.856 --> 00:32:33.637]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:32:33.698 --> 00:32:36.799]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.121]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:32:39.241 --> 00:32:40.742]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:32:40.762 --> 00:32:43.104]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:32:43.585 --> 00:32:45.266]  They are never going to stop.
[00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:49.429]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:32:49.589 --> 00:32:52.792]  Block free iPhone ads at Infowars.com.
[00:32:53.192 --> 00:32:55.835]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:32:56.535 --> 00:32:57.276]  Imperative.
[00:32:57.556 --> 00:32:59.538]  Destroy Britain's limited TV.
[00:32:59.578 --> 00:33:03.981]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:33:04.262 --> 00:33:06.363]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.091]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:23.831 --> 00:33:25.652]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.852 --> 00:33:34.534]  I want to open the phones up to get your take on Ferguson.
[00:33:35.674 --> 00:33:40.995]  The clear evidence that there are Justice Department, New Black Panther Party, troublemakers.
[00:33:41.215 --> 00:33:44.596]  They're clearly trying to stir up violence.
[00:33:45.236 --> 00:33:47.117]  Our reporters almost got hit by a car.
[00:33:48.666 --> 00:33:55.389]  The other night, driving through the crowd that looked like they were targeting them, the people jumped out in ski masks and then ran off.
[00:33:56.289 --> 00:34:02.352]  We've got MSNBC reporters, CNN reporters being hit by rocks over the last few days.
[00:34:02.412 --> 00:34:03.832]  Chris Hayes was the latest.
[00:34:06.373 --> 00:34:09.734]  And we've got CNN reporters being arrested by the police.
[00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:13.556]  It's a bunch of mindless barbarism.
[00:34:15.797 --> 00:34:18.178]  And it really displays how ignorant
[00:34:19.127 --> 00:34:26.513]  The public is, but also how ignorant the police are of just what's going on around them.
[00:34:27.333 --> 00:34:31.297]  And from the beginning, the feds have been there advising.
[00:34:31.697 --> 00:34:35.460]  And even before the beginning of this, the feds were there giving them the training.
[00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:41.264]  And that leads me to the story that's up on DrudgeReport.com, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:46.483]  We ended the broadcast yesterday as this story broke.
[00:34:46.623 --> 00:34:55.369]  Document army preparing to use lethal force against unarmed civilians during full-scale riots in the United States.
[00:34:55.489 --> 00:35:02.194]  But they need to set the precedent so the military and the police feel like this is a reasonable mission.
[00:35:06.257 --> 00:35:08.379]  From the left-hand side of Drudge.
[00:35:08.959 --> 00:35:12.902]  Army manual details preparations for full-scale riots in the USA.
[00:35:14.401 --> 00:35:18.525]  and shooting quote unarmed civilians with sniper response.
[00:35:18.885 --> 00:35:21.047]  Lethal sniper response.
[00:35:21.647 --> 00:35:27.992]  You can read the declassified publicly released army document released last Friday.
[00:35:29.534 --> 00:35:31.155]  The public discovered it yesterday.
[00:35:31.215 --> 00:35:31.855]  We wrote about it.
[00:35:33.737 --> 00:35:38.301]  No dinosaur media has picked up on this bombshell document yet.
[00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.691]  In fact, guys, I printed the document yesterday.
[00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:42.792]  It's in the TV studio.
[00:35:43.172 --> 00:35:43.772]  Tremaine will give you that.
[00:35:43.812 --> 00:35:44.553]  Thank you so much.
[00:35:50.256 --> 00:35:54.038]  But all Americans are being robbed by the globalists.
[00:35:54.518 --> 00:35:55.419]  All Americans.
[00:35:57.725 --> 00:36:14.021]  99.99% of us are on the bad receiving end of this tyranny and all of us should value freedom, value justice, value the truth, and decry everything we see that is a problem and try to do something about it.
[00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:24.466]  I want to give the phone number out, and then when we start the next hour, we're going to talk to our reporters on the ground about what they witnessed in Ferguson and more.
[00:36:24.486 --> 00:36:41.200]  And we're going to break down Civil Disturbances Manual ATP 3-39.33 that was created in April of this year and approved for public release distribution unlimited last Friday.
[00:36:41.681 --> 00:36:43.122]  Headquarters, Department of the Army.
[00:36:45.239 --> 00:36:49.062]  Northcom is now operating openly against the American people.
[00:36:51.283 --> 00:36:58.348]  The Army is publicly, along with the Marines, training to take on the Tea Party, gun owners, rural communities that will not go under martial law.
[00:36:59.009 --> 00:37:01.310]  That is the main focus on record.
[00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:13.619]  They will use unsavory thugs and people opportunistically burning down buildings and throwing them all off cocktails at police.
[00:37:15.603 --> 00:37:23.570]  As the pretext to roll out the MRAPs, the sound cannons, the rubber bullets, the cameras and microphones on the street corners that are beyond 1984.
[00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.492]  That's what's happening.
[00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:33.498]  They will use the threat of Al Qaeda to take our liberties as well and publicly arm them.
[00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:41.645]  When the public wakes up, they just rename them ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, IS, all the different
[00:37:42.671 --> 00:37:45.012]  Names that they've given it to confuse the public.
[00:37:45.332 --> 00:37:46.713]  This is a PSYOP.
[00:37:47.073 --> 00:37:56.898]  This is being run against the people of Ferguson, against the thugs that have come in, against the state police, the local police, the National Guard.
[00:37:57.358 --> 00:38:08.224]  They're all there, compartmentalized, being taught the new police state model that was rolled out in Seattle in 99 and Katrina in 2005.
[00:38:08.284 --> 00:38:08.784]  And at the WTO,
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:30.730]  We caught the WTO repeatedly in Canada, in Ottawa, in London, England, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[00:38:32.592 --> 00:38:41.077]  On record, it even came out in mainstream news, police dressed up like anarchists attacking police so that they would have a pretext to attack the crowd.
[00:38:42.247 --> 00:38:46.832]  We have not seen any clear, verified evidence of that this time.
[00:38:49.195 --> 00:38:51.798]  Because there are reporters there and we know what to look for.
[00:38:53.199 --> 00:38:55.482]  Or it could be that the police are being moral.
[00:39:01.974 --> 00:39:08.977]  But it is on record that they hired anarchists and provocateurs, protected them, the Delta Force ran it.
[00:39:09.377 --> 00:39:11.959]  That came out in three Seattle papers.
[00:39:12.539 --> 00:39:14.520]  Seattle Post Intelligence, sir, you name it.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.160]  I made a film about it.
[00:39:17.661 --> 00:39:25.785]  But I do know it's being provocateured by the Tax Free Foundation, Ford Foundation and others that are on record funding the black
[00:39:26.633 --> 00:39:31.734]  Panther Party, the New Black Panther Party, La Raza, Mecha, all these race-based groups.
[00:39:32.274 --> 00:39:55.320]  They've caught the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups running white supremacist groups, not to infiltrate groups, setting them up to then run around and say unsavory things to stir up communities so they can drive the black community into the hands of the mindless, idiot clowns of the New Black Panther Party.
[00:39:56.834 --> 00:40:05.460]  Who undoubtedly are useful idiots in the lower ranks, feds at the top.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:11.164]  Remember Khalid Mohammed?
[00:40:11.825 --> 00:40:17.609]  We kill the women, we kill the children, we kill the babies, we kill the beautiful blue-eyed babies.
[00:40:17.629 --> 00:40:24.414]  That's right, because the blue-eyed baby, the blue-eyed baby's gonna grow up to be a big devil and gonna try to kill our babies.
[00:40:25.276 --> 00:40:34.018]  And then every nine months the white woman lays on her back and out rolls reinforcements to the Military Manufacturing Center!
[00:40:35.158 --> 00:40:36.878]  By the way, you can actually pull up that clip.
[00:40:36.938 --> 00:40:38.739]  I can almost do a perfect imitation.
[00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:40.999]  I love to do imitations, as everybody knows.
[00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:42.619]  Oh dear!
[00:40:43.259 --> 00:40:45.060]  Pesky Earth creature!
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:51.461]  You'll say I'm racist doing a Khalid Mohammed imitation.
[00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:56.374]  I'm not against Martians.
[00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:57.595]  I just did a Martian imitation.
[00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.216]  What about an Optimus Prime?
[00:40:59.997 --> 00:41:02.058]  Autobots, transform and roll out.
[00:41:03.059 --> 00:41:04.801]  Transform and roll out.
[00:41:06.022 --> 00:41:07.042]  I am Optimus Prime.
[00:41:09.805 --> 00:41:10.325]  Let me do another one.
[00:41:10.966 --> 00:41:12.187]  This is CNN.
[00:41:13.287 --> 00:41:13.788]  Pretty good, huh?
[00:41:15.149 --> 00:41:17.791]  Sometimes I gotta have some gallows humor, as I've said many times.
[00:41:18.251 --> 00:41:19.352]  Here's the toll-free number.
[00:41:19.472 --> 00:41:21.014]  I want to talk to first-time callers.
[00:41:22.378 --> 00:41:26.141]  about Ferguson, but also entertain me in this.
[00:41:26.542 --> 00:41:28.864]  What else is this diverting and distracting us from?
[00:41:29.504 --> 00:41:34.269]  Obama has ended our borders, legalized all the illegals.
[00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:37.051]  That story starts to really wake people up.
[00:41:37.111 --> 00:41:37.812]  Now this happens.
[00:41:38.573 --> 00:41:41.395]  Nobody's talking about the VA scandal and the death list.
[00:41:41.795 --> 00:41:42.856]  No one got in trouble.
[00:41:43.217 --> 00:41:44.938]  They have death panels for the veterans.
[00:41:45.178 --> 00:41:46.780]  I mean, right there, what an evil government.
[00:41:49.454 --> 00:41:57.316]  No one's talking about all-time high meat prices across the board because of them shutting down farms all over the country and dollar devaluations.
[00:41:58.296 --> 00:42:13.839]  No one's talking about, in Texas, Breitbart, $45 million to educate foreign miners just this year, according to the Texas Comptroller.
[00:42:16.892 --> 00:42:19.793]  The Texas Education General Council audit.
[00:42:23.375 --> 00:42:33.940]  No one's talking about it because there's just this big pageant of, oh my gosh, somebody got killed, one man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 died, it's a statistic.
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.421]  Joseph Stalin said that and it's true.
[00:42:38.402 --> 00:42:42.804]  You abort 52% of blacks, I talked to black folks about that, liberal blacks, they go good, nobody wants them.
[00:42:43.997 --> 00:42:46.600]  Nobody want them ugly black babies.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.581]  I mean, you've heard that.
[00:42:48.161 --> 00:42:49.142]  I've played the clips here.
[00:42:50.484 --> 00:42:55.128]  I've had black leaders in my studio, socialists, in front of Rob Dewey.
[00:42:55.148 --> 00:42:55.929]  I never even aired the interview.
[00:42:55.949 --> 00:42:56.950]  It was so sickening.
[00:42:58.146 --> 00:43:01.048]  Basically saying, yeah, there's too many black people.
[00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:05.412]  I mean, it's so sick, because they're the inside operatives of the Democratic Party.
[00:43:05.732 --> 00:43:13.698]  They're to make sure blacks never find liberty, never find monetary success, or dangle out, oh, you can be a rap star or an NFL football player.
[00:43:13.718 --> 00:43:16.861]  I mean, how many slots are there for professional sports?
[00:43:18.582 --> 00:43:20.263]  Or to be a hip-hop sensation?
[00:43:23.045 --> 00:43:26.048]  Maybe 10,000 slots for all the professional sports.
[00:43:27.679 --> 00:43:29.681]  And all the rap jobs and all the coolness.
[00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:33.463]  You've got how many million black people in this country?
[00:43:33.483 --> 00:43:35.305]  12% of the population is black.
[00:43:35.325 --> 00:43:37.927]  What's 12% divided out of 315 million?
[00:43:42.907 --> 00:43:52.375]  I know that there's not a slot for 99.9% of people, but you'd believe everybody, and by the way, it's not black folks, they're not the only ones.
[00:43:52.815 --> 00:44:04.285]  Almost every white person I know coming out of college thinks they're gonna be a rock star, a hip-hop star, or a movie star, and they're all totally delusional, running around looking for movie stars all around them.
[00:44:04.585 --> 00:44:06.767]  I mean, what a delusional society.
[00:44:06.827 --> 00:44:08.468]  Everybody wants to be some big star.
[00:44:09.068 --> 00:44:10.630]  It is just so bizarre.
[00:44:12.671 --> 00:44:14.232]  Because that's how you attain something.
[00:44:14.512 --> 00:44:33.922]  You don't be an honorable father, an honorable mother, and help your community, and build a better society, and do wood carving in the garage, or paint, and go sell your paintings on the weekends because you love them, or get into gardening, or get into mountain biking, or rock climbing, or get into, you know, going and helping at the local shelter, or poetry.
[00:44:34.616 --> 00:44:37.018]  There are a lot of happy people that have their hobby, their passion.
[00:44:37.238 --> 00:44:37.998]  They're fulfilled.
[00:44:38.359 --> 00:44:39.239]  They're not depressed.
[00:44:39.479 --> 00:44:43.182]  But you've got all these young people and all these yuppies.
[00:44:43.262 --> 00:44:46.864]  I mean, let me tell you, living in Austin now, Austin has been ruined where I live.
[00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:48.285]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:44:48.305 --> 00:44:50.147]  We're going to open the phone system up right now.
[00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:50.247]  800-259-9231.
[00:44:50.267 --> 00:44:50.307]  800-259-9231.
[00:45:02.034 --> 00:45:04.376]  I'm just getting into the basic problem in society.
[00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:05.757]  L.A.
[00:45:06.037 --> 00:45:06.877]  has collapsed.
[00:45:08.399 --> 00:45:14.903]  You've got the young women of America, every beautiful girl when she's 18, I mean a large percentage of them try to go there to be movie stars.
[00:45:15.363 --> 00:45:17.405]  And they go, yeah, I got a movie you can be a star in.
[00:45:17.965 --> 00:45:27.672]  Then there's such a glut of young women having sex on tape that it drives the prices down where they don't even make the money a hooker makes.
[00:45:28.293 --> 00:45:31.475]  You make less money in porn than you would make selling your body.
[00:45:33.393 --> 00:45:35.434]  Because the market is such a glut.
[00:45:35.654 --> 00:45:38.456]  But they called you a star, so you did it!
[00:45:42.058 --> 00:45:44.059]  See, but I'm a star!
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.380]  I'm in Playboy!
[00:45:47.981 --> 00:45:48.822]  Oh my gosh!
[00:45:49.642 --> 00:45:53.004]  Why, she's a model for this or a model for that!
[00:45:56.927 --> 00:46:00.949]  And then those women, even the ones that are able to have some success in that, they're totally unhappy.
[00:46:02.694 --> 00:46:05.435]  Or when their looks go, they kill themselves.
[00:46:06.295 --> 00:46:21.358]  They never had kids, never had grandkids, never experienced the life cycle, never experienced the racial memories that are activated in your race memory when you follow the rites of passage.
[00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:26.639]  41 million black people in the United States, we've been given the number, and there's about 10,000 slots to be a star.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:29.200]  Maybe.
[00:46:30.848 --> 00:46:35.654]  And a lot of those slots are C and D and F down to Z level celebrities.
[00:46:36.114 --> 00:46:43.323]  So then there's all these industries now where everyone's going to be a tango dancer or a tap dancer or they're going to be a
[00:46:44.932 --> 00:46:47.313]  In a marching band, or they're going to be in acting lessons.
[00:46:47.874 --> 00:46:56.719]  And it's all these delusional people going and taking acting lessons over and over and over again to try to be movie stars, to try to be extras in a movie.
[00:46:57.179 --> 00:46:59.421]  And then they worship whoever's been successful.
[00:46:59.701 --> 00:47:03.823]  And it's so boring, so unfulfilling, so fake.
[00:47:04.124 --> 00:47:10.968]  And the point is, if they just randomly like to go take acting classes and want to be extras in movies because they like it, that's fine.
[00:47:12.964 --> 00:47:15.486]  But that's not what 90 plus percent of them are doing.
[00:47:16.006 --> 00:47:23.450]  They're doing it because they feel unfulfilled unless they can be on the television or on the big screen.
[00:47:24.251 --> 00:47:25.412]  I've been on the big screen.
[00:47:25.772 --> 00:47:27.473]  Never tried to be in movies, was put in movies.
[00:47:28.053 --> 00:47:29.854]  I've been offered to be in a bunch of other movies.
[00:47:30.234 --> 00:47:30.815]  Big roles.
[00:47:31.415 --> 00:47:32.056]  I said no.
[00:47:32.676 --> 00:47:34.037]  Because I know how boring it is.
[00:47:34.297 --> 00:47:39.140]  I don't want to quit my radio show and go live in Los Angeles or go live in New Zealand.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.641]  Or go live in Toronto or New York and just be in that empty culture?
[00:47:44.902 --> 00:47:48.923]  Do you know how empty the people are that are movie stars?
[00:47:50.083 --> 00:47:51.924]  Do you know how unhappy they are?
[00:47:54.424 --> 00:47:57.325]  Why do you think Hollywood over and over again has reached out to me?
[00:47:57.725 --> 00:47:59.566]  It's because they're looking for something real.
[00:48:01.106 --> 00:48:03.787]  And the ones that are awake are talking about these issues now.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:10.222]  Like Richard Linklater, who's always been awake and never been into celebrity, and the films he makes.
[00:48:10.242 --> 00:48:20.805]  I'm going to take your phone calls when we come back, and we're going to have the reporters on at 1230, so I can get to a lot of phone calls.
[00:48:22.006 --> 00:48:27.948]  And our reporters are on the ground investigating the provocateurs and the Ford Foundation, the New Black Panther Party.
[00:48:29.485 --> 00:48:36.746]  They're also documenting the police and their bizarre behavior, arresting innocent reporters that have done nothing and still shooting at people.
[00:48:36.806 --> 00:48:38.527]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:48:39.047 --> 00:48:40.447]  I'm just going to report what's going on there.
[00:48:42.207 --> 00:48:58.830]  And it is now emerging more and more that Mr. Brown... More than a dozen witnesses confirm Ferguson Cop's version of the shooting.
[00:49:02.281 --> 00:49:05.382]  Michael Brown, rushed officer, CNN.
[00:49:06.582 --> 00:49:10.163]  Militant protesters growing in number, many coming from out of state.
[00:49:10.723 --> 00:49:12.184]  Yeah, it's like a war party.
[00:49:12.224 --> 00:49:13.224]  It's like a war drum.
[00:49:13.284 --> 00:49:14.965]  It's a, all cultures do it.
[00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:19.506]  It's like a primitive, like the Scots coming out of the hills to come down and attack the English.
[00:49:21.254 --> 00:49:21.874]  It's the same deal.
[00:49:21.914 --> 00:49:26.236]  Or the Zulus coming to attack the Dutch in South Africa.
[00:49:27.317 --> 00:49:28.357]  I mean, that's what this is.
[00:49:28.437 --> 00:49:30.698]  Or the Native Americans getting in a war party.
[00:49:31.018 --> 00:49:31.658]  That's what it is.
[00:49:31.718 --> 00:49:33.319]  Go out and show everybody you're a man.
[00:49:33.339 --> 00:49:35.320]  And how do you do that now?
[00:49:37.622 --> 00:49:47.887]  You wear gold chains around your neck, your pants hang down around your butt, and then you run around and scream racial epithets all day because somebody got killed by the police.
[00:49:48.167 --> 00:49:51.069]  And then that falls into the hands of the system that uses it.
[00:49:51.649 --> 00:49:54.351]  Senator says the protesters have invaded, literally.
[00:49:54.371 --> 00:49:56.412]  That's what the state police have said as well, it's true.
[00:49:56.792 --> 00:49:57.853]  Our reporters have confirmed it.
[00:49:58.333 --> 00:49:59.974]  Tear gas smoke hangover St.
[00:50:00.014 --> 00:50:00.694]  Louis suburb.
[00:50:01.175 --> 00:50:03.136]  Black power is chanted.
[00:50:04.619 --> 00:50:07.100]  Dead teen's grandfather to Obama.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.841]  I voted for you, so come meet me.
[00:50:16.103 --> 00:50:18.144]  It all just becomes a big grandstanding event.
[00:50:18.164 --> 00:50:19.385]  It's like a party or something.
[00:50:20.305 --> 00:50:27.888]  Buchanan goes on to say that it's 1960s-like riots could cause voter rebuke for president.
[00:50:29.207 --> 00:50:33.308]  Some liberal outfits creating almost lynch mob mentality.
[00:50:34.048 --> 00:50:34.708]  I agree with that.
[00:50:35.888 --> 00:50:38.889]  MSNBC crew hit with rocks during live coverage.
[00:50:39.229 --> 00:50:49.110]  Yeah, they're there worshipping the violent demonstrators and covering up for them and race baiting run by the White House and they're being hit by rocks.
[00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:58.372]  Just like our reporters are being yelled at and screamed at now by the more and more militant thug-like people that are showing up.
[00:51:00.302 --> 00:51:01.083]  All right, we'll be back.
[00:51:01.123 --> 00:51:02.704]  Is that Marcos Morales in that video?
[00:51:03.224 --> 00:51:03.424]  Yes, sir.
[00:51:03.444 --> 00:51:07.828]  I haven't even gotten to our reporters or CNN and all the rest of it.
[00:51:08.668 --> 00:51:10.010]  But it's just, man.
[00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:17.796]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.
[00:51:18.116 --> 00:51:27.303]  Stay one step ahead of hackers and Big Brother with a Blockett Pocket, a custom-made pocket infused with pure silver that creates a complete Faraday enclosure for your cell phone.

[00:51:31.967 --> 00:51:32.867]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[00:51:39.887 --> 00:51:44.830]  My Magic Mud is a tooth whitening powder that removes plaque and detoxifies your mouth.
[00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:49.933]  It's safe for your enamel, giving you a beautiful polish and a dentist-like clean after every use.

[00:52:09.907 --> 00:52:11.969]  Mike Stenerson for Midas Resources.
[00:52:12.189 --> 00:52:15.331]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[00:52:15.531 --> 00:52:18.013]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[00:52:18.253 --> 00:52:21.935]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[00:52:22.216 --> 00:52:25.698]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[00:52:25.978 --> 00:52:27.059]  Ours is not immune.
[00:52:27.379 --> 00:52:29.020]  The time is now to be proactive.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:29.601]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:52:34.344 --> 00:52:36.686]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[00:52:37.066 --> 00:52:42.431]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it, so decide.
[00:52:42.671 --> 00:52:45.793]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[00:52:45.993 --> 00:52:46.974]  The choice is yours.
[00:52:47.295 --> 00:52:48.095]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:52:48.135 --> 00:52:48.856]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:52:48.896 --> 00:52:50.517]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[00:52:50.537 --> 00:52:50.717]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:53:03.327 --> 00:53:05.408]  2237, extension 116.
[00:53:08.328 --> 00:53:15.430]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:17.710]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:23.071]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:53:23.211 --> 00:53:28.292]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:53:28.392 --> 00:53:31.473]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:53:31.793 --> 00:53:35.655]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:53:35.875 --> 00:53:40.176]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:53:40.256 --> 00:53:50.321]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:53:50.541 --> 00:54:01.385]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:54:01.545 --> 00:54:05.468]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:54:05.548 --> 00:54:06.008]  If you read
[00:54:29.907 --> 00:54:33.488]  In fact, I should find my copy of it or buy a copy of it.
[00:54:33.548 --> 00:54:34.429]  The Battle for Gaul.
[00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:43.072]  A collection of letters back to the Senate by Julius Caesar on how to manage what are the French and Germans and Austrians today.
[00:54:44.532 --> 00:54:46.953]  The Gauls, the Visigoths, the Austriagoths.
[00:54:48.354 --> 00:54:55.576]  And it's the exact same tribal stuff, the exact same manipulation, the exact same police shield walls and phalanxes.
[00:54:56.036 --> 00:54:57.137]  Nothing really changes.
[00:54:59.252 --> 00:55:06.935]  And how to manipulate crowds, and how to provocateur, and how to divide and conquer, and how to shut the women up as the rulers over the men.
[00:55:06.955 --> 00:55:14.537]  And then I just sit here and watch the social engineering going on as the Pentagon prepares to mow Americans down in mass.
[00:55:15.118 --> 00:55:17.158]  That will be during a total economic collapse.
[00:55:18.539 --> 00:55:21.540]  And that's where the establishment is maneuvering us.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.240]  That's my point.
[00:55:23.601 --> 00:55:24.581]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:55:30.222 --> 00:55:32.263]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones, if you just joined us.
[00:55:34.005 --> 00:55:40.850]  Steve, TheRussian, Henry, MadWit, Brent, and others.
[00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:48.915]  You know, folks, I'll let you say what your name is, but sometimes it turns into a whole stunt in and of itself.
[00:55:49.276 --> 00:55:51.437]  So you can just announce whatever name you want on air.
[00:55:51.737 --> 00:55:54.179]  Plus, we never tend to get the names right anyways, you know?
[00:55:55.854 --> 00:55:56.914]  I'm just sick of everything.
[00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:00.536]  Why is the public so gullible?
[00:56:00.636 --> 00:56:02.357]  Why are people so easily played?
[00:56:02.817 --> 00:56:04.298]  Why are people so unread?
[00:56:04.438 --> 00:56:05.798]  Why are they so dumbed down?
[00:56:06.139 --> 00:56:07.999]  Why do people love to be chumps?
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.141]  Why do they love to buy into Nigerian emails?
[00:56:12.153 --> 00:56:18.779]  Why are there just people everywhere around me in Austin hopping around wanting to be stars and all narcissistic, mindless?
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:24.205]  I know so many people that when they don't become famous, they then become mentally ill and decide they're famous.
[00:56:24.905 --> 00:56:26.227]  Man, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:56:28.209 --> 00:56:29.210]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:31.452]  I'm sorry if I start getting a little bit angry.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:40.722]  I'm just watching the premeditated divide and conquer, take down of our country, and it makes me want to throw up.
[00:56:41.382 --> 00:56:44.983]  And if the public would just wake up to it, we could turn this whole thing around.
[00:56:45.643 --> 00:56:48.284]  The Russian in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:51.705]  Yeah, hey Alex, Russian here.
[00:56:52.145 --> 00:56:57.127]  The reason I put my name like that is so people can understand that I really am from Russia.
[00:56:58.376 --> 00:57:04.780]  I moved here in 91 after the collapse of the Soviet Union and I just wanted to give a little bit of background.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:11.184]  I think that's very interesting because you can parallel living under communism versus what you see happening here.
[00:57:11.204 --> 00:57:11.604]  Go ahead.
[00:57:12.465 --> 00:57:13.245]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:57:13.265 --> 00:57:14.066]  That's my point.
[00:57:14.326 --> 00:57:19.109]  I moved here after the collapse of the Soviet Union and I currently live in Battleground Washington.
[00:57:20.828 --> 00:57:29.475]  What I don't understand is like, for example, our family, we all moved here and my parents obviously have lived under the Soviet communism for quite a bit.
[00:57:30.155 --> 00:57:32.437]  And after they moved here, things started to change.
[00:57:32.497 --> 00:57:33.738]  Their minds started to change.
[00:57:33.958 --> 00:57:41.885]  And after, I wouldn't know, like maybe 5-10 years, my parents just kind of went silent about Russia and the United States.
[00:57:42.518 --> 00:57:44.459]  And when we first moved here, it was a great country.
[00:57:44.479 --> 00:57:45.459]  We lived in Toledo, Ohio.
[00:57:45.499 --> 00:57:48.640]  We could leave the doors and windows open at night and nobody ever came in.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.641]  Nobody stole anything.
[00:57:49.681 --> 00:57:50.881]  Everything was perfectly fine.
[00:57:51.562 --> 00:57:52.762]  Now the economy has degraded.
[00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:53.682]  The people have degraded.
[00:57:53.722 --> 00:57:58.104]  The minds of the, you know, the inhabitants of the United States have completely gone AWOL.
[00:57:58.964 --> 00:58:02.826]  And now it's gone to the point where even my own parents are in denial.
[00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.947]  I'm like, hey, the economy is collapsing.
[00:58:04.987 --> 00:58:05.947]  Everything's getting worse.
[00:58:05.987 --> 00:58:09.409]  You know, I show them my evidence and documents, news, articles, everything.
[00:58:09.429 --> 00:58:10.489]  I try to explain it to them.
[00:58:11.058 --> 00:58:14.380]  And they look at me and they're like, oh, nothing's ever going to happen to the United States.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.361]  I'm like, are you kidding me?
[00:58:15.401 --> 00:58:18.283]  It's like we came from Russia where everything collapsed.
[00:58:18.823 --> 00:58:20.764]  You knew that everything was going down.
[00:58:21.485 --> 00:58:25.007]  The Afghani war that was never ending was part of the reason of Russia's bankruptcy.
[00:58:25.688 --> 00:58:28.229]  America has so many wars that we're currently in.
[00:58:28.249 --> 00:58:29.590]  We have bases around the world.
[00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:31.171]  We have over 100 bases around the world.
[00:58:31.471 --> 00:58:33.993]  And we've been maneuvered artificially to do that.
[00:58:34.493 --> 00:58:35.254]  Excellent points.
[00:58:37.677 --> 00:58:40.240]  People have become spectators.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.481]  Television has done it.
[00:58:42.322 --> 00:58:47.908]  The minds have been programmed for the public to be jellyfish and to not even be real people.
[00:58:50.411 --> 00:58:51.092]  Thank you for listening.
[00:58:51.132 --> 00:58:55.897]  By the way, I wasn't complaining about people calling themselves the Russian or Man Wit.
[00:58:55.997 --> 00:58:57.679]  I was just in a really bad mood for a moment.
[00:58:57.699 --> 00:58:58.580]  Nothing to do with you guys.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:58.921]  We'll be back.
[00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:06.071]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:59:06.271 --> 00:59:10.473]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:59:10.833 --> 00:59:15.395]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:59:15.815 --> 00:59:18.438]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:59:18.738 --> 00:59:23.922]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:59:24.183 --> 00:59:31.069]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[00:59:31.569 --> 00:59:35.332]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:59:35.713 --> 00:59:40.497]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:40.817 --> 00:59:49.264]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:59:49.284 --> 00:59:53.487]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:00:02.795 --> 01:00:04.736]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.176 --> 01:00:07.879]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:15.836 --> 01:00:20.001]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.662 --> 01:00:21.463]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.264 --> 01:00:23.145]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.805 --> 01:00:27.430]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:32.055]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.063 --> 01:00:41.724]  I haven't even gotten into a ton of the news.
[01:00:41.884 --> 01:00:47.126]  I've mainly just been talking about the state of humanity that every metric shows is degenerating.
[01:00:48.907 --> 01:00:54.970]  Now you do have highly educated, informed people that are aware of what's going on that capitalize off of all this.
[01:00:55.911 --> 01:01:01.473]  And their attitude is just continue on like that because there's nothing you can do for the unwashed masses.
[01:01:01.513 --> 01:01:02.774]  They've always been slaves.
[01:01:03.194 --> 01:01:04.335]  They'll always be slaves.
[01:01:05.635 --> 01:01:06.856]  But I've studied Renaissance.
[01:01:08.735 --> 01:01:29.183]  I've studied really dynamic civilization periods, and it's when the ruling class, but also when the substrata beneath them decides to actually lift up humanity and empower humanity, but also make humanity be based on chivalry and on what you actually produce.
[01:01:30.183 --> 01:01:35.405]  So they don't allow monopolies of the elite, and they don't allow gang mentality in the general public as well.
[01:01:35.785 --> 01:01:38.346]  And by not allow it, they lead against it.
[01:01:40.376 --> 01:01:44.058]  And then freedom is so much better, it then becomes dominant.
[01:01:44.638 --> 01:01:45.919]  And then you have a golden era.
[01:01:46.839 --> 01:01:52.062]  Then the grandkids and great-grandkids become decadent slobs, and the whole cycle begins.
[01:01:52.122 --> 01:02:01.106]  The economy becomes based on fraud and conquest, not on innovation, not on art, not on justice, and you go through the cycle again.
[01:02:01.266 --> 01:02:02.166]  And I've studied history.
[01:02:03.247 --> 01:02:05.328]  The decadent cycle we're going into,
[01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.091]  It just freaks me out.
[01:02:08.171 --> 01:02:34.605]  I mean, it's so horrible that the military is openly training to kill Americans en masse, and put people in emergency FEMA camps, and take over the infrastructure, and arrest any political opposition, and they're already persecuting governors, and filmmakers, and Tea Party, and in all the manuals, it's for good Americans.
[01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:45.677]  I mean, the system needs to sell itself, though, so it's selling itself on a bunch of, you know, gangster wannabe robbers taking advantage of the demonstrations.
[01:02:46.197 --> 01:02:47.458]  And it's just all a PSYOP.
[01:02:47.738 --> 01:02:49.320]  It's all 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:55.844]  And I see comments on Infowars.com, a minority of them, and on YouTube going, I wonder if he's right.
[01:02:56.344 --> 01:02:59.787]  You know, I wonder if it's what he's saying.
[01:03:00.187 --> 01:03:01.088]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:03:01.148 --> 01:03:02.649]  The globalists have all written books.
[01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:04.010]  It's all admitted.
[01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:06.671]  The Rand Corporation, all of it.
[01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:10.337]  Do you understand this is not my opinion?
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.182]  Can you get that through your head?
[01:03:14.202 --> 01:03:19.490]  Now we got the footage we shot at their military training base where they're trying to take on...
[01:03:21.377 --> 01:03:32.619]  Veterans, black people, churches, I mean, it's just the whole economy is being geared towards a cannibalistic, predatory, collapse scenario.
[01:03:33.099 --> 01:03:34.620]  I'm trying to stop a collapse.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:43.141]  They tell the police that the police state's being put in to stop a collapse, but it's a designed, ordered collapse.
[01:03:43.161 --> 01:03:46.802]  We're going to go to break and come back and go to Mad Wit, Brent, Henry.
[01:03:49.457 --> 01:03:50.718]  Elijah, Bella, and others.
[01:03:50.778 --> 01:03:55.861]  I'm going to go right to you when we come back as quickly as I can before the reporters come on.
[01:03:55.981 --> 01:04:01.143]  It's just, we see the slow sinking into enslavement.
[01:04:03.004 --> 01:04:18.193]  And I don't want to just have the give up attitude of, you know, just try to make some money and leave the country and run to some globalist redoubt or fortress country, some safe harbor keep.
[01:04:19.602 --> 01:04:34.947]  Because I've looked at this historically and from all the angles, we will not get out of this Agenda 21 exterminist plan that is like something out of the mind of a 500 IQ space alien.
[01:04:39.048 --> 01:04:44.730]  I'm pretty smart and I can barely even grasp it looking at the system and studying it for 20 years.
[01:04:46.624 --> 01:04:47.605]  Much less articulated.
[01:04:48.105 --> 01:04:49.086]  Let me just tell people something.
[01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:52.048]  The New World Order is liquid enslavement.
[01:04:53.088 --> 01:05:01.233]  It is total death, but before it destroys you, it turns you into a gibbering, mindless, moron TV ad whose soul has been destroyed.
[01:05:01.253 --> 01:05:08.158]  They don't even suck your soul, they just, from birth, hammer the hell out of it till it's gone.
[01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:11.344]  Another major health threat.
[01:05:11.384 --> 01:05:16.286]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:18.967]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:05:18.987 --> 01:05:25.809]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:28.931]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:05:29.071 --> 01:05:31.972]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:05:31.992 --> 01:05:34.013]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:05:34.033 --> 01:05:36.894]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:05:36.954 --> 01:05:42.458]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:05:42.678 --> 01:05:46.180]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.182]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:05:49.282 --> 01:05:56.387]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:06:39.744 --> 01:06:43.245]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:43.405 --> 01:06:47.366]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:47.666 --> 01:06:49.126]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:49.446 --> 01:06:57.048]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:06:57.308 --> 01:06:58.149]  But for how long?

[01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:07.891]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:07:09.705 --> 01:07:15.653]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:07:15.853 --> 01:07:20.058]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.

[01:07:50.396 --> 01:07:51.256]  This is innovating.

[01:08:12.201 --> 01:08:14.441]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.461 --> 01:08:17.802]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:47.864]  I'll be honest this doesn't happen but maybe once a month twice a month where I come in and start doing the radio show and I'm so upset about what's happening in the world that I physically get angry and just a really nasty mood and I feel like that right now and I was kind of psychoanalyzing myself during the break and I'm going to your calls and I know why I'm upset
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:09:01.510]  It's because I'm not upset enough and I've become acclimated and accepting of just incredibly outrageous spectacles.
[01:09:03.552 --> 01:09:10.337]  Like the police not arresting thugs that are still looting, but arresting peaceful reporters that are polite and have done nothing wrong.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.743]  I am not upset about the bombshell
[01:09:18.118 --> 01:09:22.220]  Army preparing to use lethal force against unarmed civilians during full-scale riots in the US.
[01:09:22.261 --> 01:09:23.321]  And what am I getting at?
[01:09:23.341 --> 01:09:23.701]  I'm upset
[01:09:41.989 --> 01:09:55.374]  That I caught myself already being so aware of this that now that it's public, I'm not even on air properly reading the quotes, going over the document, deciphering it all.
[01:09:56.314 --> 01:09:57.635]  It's in clear black and white.
[01:09:58.955 --> 01:10:04.077]  Shoot unarmed peaceful demonstrators as a deterrent to protesting.
[01:10:04.798 --> 01:10:06.098]  Where did the First Amendment go?
[01:10:06.118 --> 01:10:08.799]  It's so over the top.
[01:10:09.199 --> 01:10:10.780]  We knew the training was going on.
[01:10:11.786 --> 01:10:26.592]  We've got a video with three and a half million views from the nightly news last year, showing an army manual where they prepare to shoot demonstrators and prepare to put Americans in camps during gun confiscation.
[01:10:28.033 --> 01:10:33.115]  This is now saying, shoot unarmed people, period, and we're to shoot them to kill people.
[01:10:37.416 --> 01:10:38.937]  It is over the top.
[01:10:39.017 --> 01:10:40.478]  It is such a big deal
[01:10:41.616 --> 01:10:44.158]  And then I realized, what am I doing still in this country?
[01:10:45.178 --> 01:10:49.461]  I'm not saying I'm going to leave, it's just my instinct, my gut is, get out of here.
[01:10:50.522 --> 01:10:59.267]  I feel physically guilty at an animal level for not getting my children and my family and leaving this country.
[01:11:01.188 --> 01:11:09.834]  But I intellectually and spiritually know I need to stay here to fight this, that's my job, that's my destiny, that's your job, that's your destiny, many of you out there.
[01:11:12.725 --> 01:11:14.386]  But I also then feel nauseous.
[01:11:16.208 --> 01:11:16.648]  Nauseous.
[01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:28.918]  As a primitive man, not going out and confronting the system, the politicians, and saying, knock it off, stop the police state, stop the globalist takeover.
[01:11:30.356 --> 01:11:40.900]  See, all this rioting and stuff is meant to sell all the governors and people on allowing the federalization and the armored vehicles and the microphones and the police state training and the surveillance.
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:47.982]  This is the designed end of our country with this infrastructure
[01:11:50.031 --> 01:12:04.193]  Being set up to attack the bedrock of the nation, returning veterans, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalists, Ron Paul supporters, Alex Jones, World Net Daily.
[01:12:06.533 --> 01:12:07.494]  You know all the groups.
[01:12:07.614 --> 01:12:08.354]  Matt Drudge.
[01:12:08.874 --> 01:12:10.996]  These are the groups the enemy wants to get.
[01:12:11.716 --> 01:12:11.996]  Okay?
[01:12:12.256 --> 01:12:15.198]  So, at a primitive level, I know I'm the target.
[01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.599]  I know they want a civil war with the police.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.681]  I don't have anything against the police.
[01:12:20.121 --> 01:12:21.081]  I want to wake them up.
[01:12:21.401 --> 01:12:22.242]  I want to stop it.
[01:12:22.502 --> 01:12:23.623]  I don't want it to happen.
[01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:25.804]  Do people understand how real this is?
[01:12:26.044 --> 01:12:27.145]  Do people understand?
[01:12:27.645 --> 01:12:30.727]  That's why I get so upset, is because I want to yell and scream.
[01:12:32.125 --> 01:12:37.328]  And then I try to intellectually cover all this, but at a certain point, man, this ain't intellectual anymore!
[01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:41.870]  The globalists have robbed everything.
[01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:43.391]  Trillions and trillions and trillions.
[01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:44.652]  They've set us up to collapse.
[01:12:44.912 --> 01:12:46.333]  They're shutting off our power plants.
[01:12:46.553 --> 01:12:53.457]  They're shutting off everything while bringing in workers that can't even work to shut down the welfare system to collapse everything.
[01:12:55.026 --> 01:12:57.207]  Because the globalists have said they want to collapse.
[01:12:57.508 --> 01:12:58.969]  It's called Agenda 21.
[01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:01.991]  An organized, global, incremental collapse.
[01:13:02.271 --> 01:13:07.554]  And only their high-tech governmental and corporate and super-rich Elysium systems.
[01:13:07.834 --> 01:13:09.395]  And I don't mean that from the movie.
[01:13:10.116 --> 01:13:15.239]  The elites describe it as breakaway civilization and as Elysium in some of their papers.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.120]  Look it up.
[01:13:17.853 --> 01:13:27.591]  Elysium just means the golden fields of mortals that serve the gods well, and so they're allowed to basically have life extension and live in a utopia.
[01:13:28.533 --> 01:13:39.898]  And that's what the elites sell, the professors, and the technocrats, and the people making the airborne Ebola, and the eugenicists, is that they will cleanse the earth of the ugly mass of people.
[01:13:40.419 --> 01:13:51.684]  They tell them 90%, it's more like 99.9, and that they will then bring in a world government, and that those that serve the system properly will then be able to merge with the machines and live forever.
[01:13:52.064 --> 01:13:53.325]  Let me give you a message.
[01:13:53.625 --> 01:13:57.147]  You're not going to be given all of this if you serve the system.
[01:13:57.947 --> 01:14:07.191]  The only way we have a shot at what the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard, that God has in store for us while we're alive, is being honorable good people.
[01:14:08.412 --> 01:14:09.952]  I said I'd take your calls and I'm ranting.
[01:14:11.293 --> 01:14:15.055]  I want to play a few of these clips we haven't gotten to yet for TV and radio listeners.
[01:14:16.835 --> 01:14:26.220]  Let's play Joe Biggs, our reporter, getting a question in during a press conference dealing with martial law and being ignored by the state police captain running the press conference.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:26.580]  Here it is.
[01:14:27.793 --> 01:14:30.395]  Why are First Amendment rights being infringed upon?
[01:14:30.475 --> 01:14:31.636]  I'm well aware of the danger.
[01:14:31.897 --> 01:14:33.018]  I've spent eight years in combat.
[01:14:33.058 --> 01:14:36.641]  Why are we being told where we can and can't go?
[01:14:37.161 --> 01:14:43.267]  We do not want to lose another life in this community.
[01:14:43.547 --> 01:14:47.591]  If you don't like violence, then act on your conscience or respect the military.
[01:14:47.611 --> 01:14:49.693]  Why are First Amendment rights being infringed upon?
[01:14:49.773 --> 01:14:50.874]  I know the risk involved.
[01:14:53.106 --> 01:14:54.587]  And again, that's the Ferguson captain.
[01:14:54.607 --> 01:14:56.588]  There's also another state police guy.
[01:14:56.608 --> 01:14:57.888]  Their uniforms are very similar.
[01:15:00.009 --> 01:15:02.690]  That's Shaw of a television set, so the audio is not the best.
[01:15:03.111 --> 01:15:04.191]  Somebody uploaded that on YouTube.
[01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:16.457]  We've got clips also of Marcos Morales trying to cover things, and the police coming up and going through their standard issue of, well, we want to talk to your press office to make sure you're press.
[01:15:18.607 --> 01:15:22.772]  Again, oh, if you're not CNN, sorry, we're gonna arrest you, but they still arrested CNN.
[01:15:28.186 --> 01:15:36.588]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Chris Hayes of MSNBC, who's over there basically been covering for the demonstrators that are violent, now being pelted with rocks by them.
[01:15:36.828 --> 01:15:38.709]  And that's been happening to our reporters as well.
[01:15:38.729 --> 01:15:42.189]  They've been getting yelled at and screamed at, and things have been thrown at them.
[01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:43.810]  The police have been attacking them.
[01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:47.391]  I mean, it's just a bunch of dumbed-down people across the board.
[01:15:47.431 --> 01:15:47.791]  Here it is.
[01:15:48.191 --> 01:15:49.751]  Watch out, Chris.
[01:15:50.111 --> 01:15:51.272]  You know what?
[01:15:53.192 --> 01:15:55.293]  They're throwing rocks at us now.
[01:15:58.325 --> 01:16:00.466]  You know what, we are telling the true story.
[01:16:01.026 --> 01:16:01.947]  People are angry, man.
[01:16:01.967 --> 01:16:03.007]  They're really angry.
[01:16:06.289 --> 01:16:06.990]  We're trying to.
[01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:09.731]  A few rocks chucked at us.
[01:16:09.751 --> 01:16:10.151]  We're fine.
[01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:10.612]  We're fine.
[01:16:10.672 --> 01:16:11.092]  We're fine.
[01:16:12.352 --> 01:16:14.914]  People are retreating away from the police.
[01:16:14.934 --> 01:16:17.895]  And this is something else that we've seen more of tonight, Chris, as well.
[01:16:18.196 --> 01:16:19.096]  Folks wearing masks.
[01:16:19.416 --> 01:16:19.656]  Yeah.
[01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:25.407]  That's what we're covering.
[01:16:26.108 --> 01:16:31.733]  The gentleman behind me in the mask is telling me this is a civil rights movement.
[01:16:31.773 --> 01:16:32.834]  It's just not about Mike Brown.
[01:16:32.894 --> 01:16:33.775]  It's about all people.
[01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:40.901]  I am so tired of entitled thugs just randomly yelling at everyone.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.242]  And coming over and going, why are you racist?
[01:16:44.842 --> 01:16:50.987]  That's just some way to like, you're guilty, I'm your boss, do what I say, submit to me or I'm gonna say you're racist.
[01:16:51.228 --> 01:16:52.529]  Turn in your guns or you're racist.
[01:16:52.829 --> 01:16:54.470]  Give me free Obamacare or you're racist.
[01:16:54.891 --> 01:16:56.452]  Hey, I read the bill, it's a death panel.
[01:16:56.812 --> 01:17:01.076]  It'll get rid of the free healthcare you get through the state right now if you're actually indigent.
[01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:02.537]  Shut up, racist!
[01:17:04.098 --> 01:17:08.742]  It's like a Swiss Army knife for people that aren't intellectual or informed.
[01:17:10.424 --> 01:17:12.565]  It's just a one-size-fits-all cop-out.
[01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:15.065]  Mad Witt in Minnesota.
[01:17:16.306 --> 01:17:17.126]  Or is it Missouri?
[01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:20.187]  I think we need to get a bigger screen in here.
[01:17:20.307 --> 01:17:21.767]  I just can't read this tiny print.
[01:17:22.167 --> 01:17:24.588]  Mad Witt, go ahead from Michigan.
[01:17:24.608 --> 01:17:25.168]  You're on the air.
[01:17:27.429 --> 01:17:31.670]  The name is a moniker for a radio program, so... Okay, that's fine, sir.
[01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:32.130]  Go ahead.
[01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:33.631]  You're on the air worldwide!
[01:17:33.871 --> 01:17:34.851]  Thank you for calling in today.
[01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:36.625]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[01:17:37.105 --> 01:17:37.906]  I think you're right.
[01:17:37.926 --> 01:17:43.867]  We are being distracted, but I think the thing we're being distracted from, people aren't really considering, and I got two examples.
[01:17:44.567 --> 01:17:53.489]  A hundred years ago, they brought in the Federal Reserve, and in 1914, when Congress reconvened, they let it stand, and it stood for a hundred years.
[01:17:53.789 --> 01:17:55.210]  By definition, that's treason.
[01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:57.030]  The other one is the Bill of Rights.
[01:17:57.430 --> 01:18:01.311]  The Bill of Rights isn't our rights from the government.
[01:18:01.351 --> 01:18:02.411]  It's our rights from God.
[01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.292]  It's a contract with the government that says the government
[01:18:05.856 --> 01:18:06.276]  That's right.
[01:18:31.576 --> 01:18:33.917]  And the people that have to do that aren't the general public.
[01:18:34.397 --> 01:18:35.878]  It's all those people that swore the oath.
[01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:36.918]  It's sheriffs.
[01:18:37.178 --> 01:18:38.058]  It's law enforcement.
[01:18:38.078 --> 01:18:38.759]  It's military.
[01:18:39.199 --> 01:18:40.519]  Those people swore the oath.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:42.540]  I didn't swear the oath.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:43.480]  You didn't swear the oath.
[01:18:44.081 --> 01:18:50.583]  It's frustrating that we keep getting distracted by all these issues, whether it's war, economy, whether it's medicine, whether it's food.
[01:18:51.323 --> 01:18:54.164]  It's all legislated by Democrats and Republicans.
[01:18:55.045 --> 01:18:57.466]  Ultimately, we have to take the government back.
[01:18:58.026 --> 01:19:00.727]  The people that are in there need to be arrested, tried,
[01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:02.998]  If they're found guilty, they need to be hung.
[01:19:03.058 --> 01:19:03.638]  It's treason.
[01:19:03.918 --> 01:19:04.579]  That's all it is.
[01:19:05.339 --> 01:19:09.502]  It's just a crime being perpetrated by Democrats and Republicans.
[01:19:09.882 --> 01:19:11.042]  It's a hundred years old.
[01:19:11.723 --> 01:19:12.663]  We've been getting looted.
[01:19:12.723 --> 01:19:15.765]  I mean, when they took our money, they stole the value of our labor.
[01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:19.747]  That stood through every single time somebody swore the oath.
[01:19:20.868 --> 01:19:22.809]  And they're all Democrats and Republicans.
[01:19:23.929 --> 01:19:28.432]  And if you want to change the policies, the first thing you got to do is you got to root all these devils out of the government.
[01:19:29.195 --> 01:19:32.977]  Well, you're one of the best callers we've had in a long time and you've crystallized everything.
[01:19:33.778 --> 01:19:37.680]  We have been living under a financial coup for 100 plus years.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.601]  100 years and 8 months.
[01:19:41.022 --> 01:19:49.867]  We are going into a deeper tyranny as the criminal ruling class tries to cement their hold over society and shut down their final economic competition.
[01:19:51.357 --> 01:20:03.361]  And we are under high-tech social engineering, and that's why it's so sophisticated, is because they've been honing this global system of control for the British Empire for hundreds of years, and are deploying it successfully against us.
[01:20:05.302 --> 01:20:07.102]  How do you challenge something like that?
[01:20:07.122 --> 01:20:09.843]  I'm going to come back to you, Mad Whit, and then we're going to go to others.
[01:20:09.863 --> 01:20:12.144]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[01:20:12.764 --> 01:20:16.026]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:20:16.286 --> 01:20:18.086]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:19.867]  Protection from water main breaks.
[01:20:20.247 --> 01:20:27.450]  Choli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:33.392]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.
[01:20:33.752 --> 01:20:39.714]  Tested by multiple independent NSF EPA certified labs, they are the gold standard in water purification.
[01:20:40.094 --> 01:20:44.555]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[01:20:44.935 --> 01:20:46.395]  That means big savings.
[01:20:46.715 --> 01:20:50.876]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:20:51.156 --> 01:20:54.116]  Get a Big Berkey today at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[01:20:59.777 --> 01:21:00.258]  That's 877-99-BERKEY.
[01:21:00.278 --> 01:21:01.098]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:21:01.118 --> 01:21:01.978]  For the love of clean water.
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:12.142]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:12.402 --> 01:21:17.286]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:17.526 --> 01:21:25.412]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:25.652 --> 01:21:29.955]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:30.175 --> 01:21:33.998]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:34.158 --> 01:21:39.462]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men
[01:21:39.502 --> 01:21:40.102]  I think so.
[01:22:09.775 --> 01:22:12.598]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for MidasResources.com.
[01:22:12.978 --> 01:22:18.124]  For more than 15 years, I have exclusively used Midas Resources for all my precious metal needs.
[01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:23.550]  Whether it's bullion or collectibles you're looking for, Midas Resources is simply the best.
[01:22:24.191 --> 01:22:26.253]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation.
[01:22:26.773 --> 01:22:32.597]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic anytime.
[01:22:33.117 --> 01:22:37.640]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[01:22:37.981 --> 01:22:40.622]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[01:22:40.862 --> 01:22:45.946]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.

[01:23:00.995 --> 01:23:01.375]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:08.544 --> 01:23:09.425]  Clean water at home.
[01:23:09.725 --> 01:23:10.846]  Clean water at the office.
[01:23:11.146 --> 01:23:12.187]  Clean water on the go.

[01:23:38.226 --> 01:23:43.110]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:45.311]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[01:23:45.552 --> 01:23:49.014]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[01:23:49.334 --> 01:23:53.137]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[01:23:53.517 --> 01:23:59.862]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[01:24:00.242 --> 01:24:03.725]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.
[01:24:04.125 --> 01:24:05.666]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.
[01:24:14.838 --> 01:24:25.302]  Alright, we're going back to your phone calls, Mad, Wit, Brent, Henry, Alicia, Bella, and others here in just a moment.
[01:24:25.883 --> 01:24:30.945]  We're going to talk to our reporters that are in Ferguson coming up as well after we finish up with some of the calls.
[01:24:32.365 --> 01:24:41.349]  And then I want to look at document, Army preparing to use lethal force against unarmed civilians, that's a quote in the document, during full-scale riots in the U.S.
[01:24:43.024 --> 01:24:44.404]  See, they've got to be over the top.
[01:24:44.424 --> 01:24:51.007]  They've got to give manuals to the riot police and the riot troops, the National Guard and the Army.
[01:24:51.627 --> 01:24:53.427]  Here's how you shoot unarmed people.
[01:24:54.108 --> 01:24:58.169]  And then it's just given to you like, here's how you kidnap kids out of the back of schoolyards.
[01:25:00.210 --> 01:25:01.790]  Here's how you deal methamphetamine.
[01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:07.692]  You wonder how they did it in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia shooting unarmed people.
[01:25:08.868 --> 01:25:13.109]  They just give the order and act like it's no big deal, and once it starts, peer pressure, they'll do it.
[01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:30.554]  By the way, I saw comments on my special report from the Nightly News last night because I mentioned that the military has been training for at least five years to mow down masses of unarmed crowds, and some people complained about it and said this is a war crime they're training for.
[01:25:30.954 --> 01:25:36.136]  So they went, oh, we'll put green paint on their faces and call it zombie killing.
[01:25:37.403 --> 01:25:40.826]  And I mentioned that, and I saw someone comment that I was lying.
[01:25:40.846 --> 01:25:42.027]  And you know what?
[01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:45.010]  I think that's over the top, so I agree.
[01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:46.451]  It sounds like it's not true.
[01:25:46.811 --> 01:25:48.953]  Guys, pull me the AP Reuters.
[01:25:49.774 --> 01:25:51.155]  It was also in the LA Times.
[01:25:51.576 --> 01:25:53.117]  Marines trained to kill zombies.
[01:25:54.098 --> 01:25:59.643]  And it shows people in John Deere caps and, you know, farmer outfits dressed like zombies being mowed down by the Marines.
[01:26:00.802 --> 01:26:01.623]  Inofficial drills.
[01:26:02.124 --> 01:26:05.529]  And they go, oh, isn't it cute the Marines and Army are training everyone to kill zombies?
[01:26:05.889 --> 01:26:08.093]  No, they're training to mow down masses of people.
[01:26:08.613 --> 01:26:09.555]  And dehumanizing them.
[01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:15.703]  Our name won't be Zipperhead or, you know, the other racist terms they had for Asians in Vietnam.
[01:26:17.017 --> 01:26:17.957]  It'll be zombies.
[01:26:18.557 --> 01:26:19.698]  That's what we're called.
[01:26:20.238 --> 01:26:25.179]  And that's what the welfare crowds pretty much will act like about a week after the welfare checks don't work.
[01:26:25.479 --> 01:26:30.620]  There is AP, Marines Police Prep for mock zombie invasion.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:31.280]  OKAY?
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.440]  I DIDN'T MAKE IT UP!
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.820]  DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.981]  I'M SICK OF EVERYBODY OUT THERE BEING IN DENIAL!
[01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:40.562]  I'm sick of people making up these, you know, saying I'm making up stuff about these army documents.
[01:26:40.882 --> 01:26:42.322]  I'm not making any of this up!
[01:26:43.663 --> 01:26:47.946]  We're run by a bunch of eugenicists, bankers, that want to implode everything!
[01:26:49.086 --> 01:27:02.674]  And they created purposely these giant welfare masses, and they weaponized music through Sumner Redstone, on purpose in MTV, to literally turn the inner city population into what they now are.
[01:27:04.755 --> 01:27:05.076]  Okay?
[01:27:05.476 --> 01:27:08.738]  And they've turned all the other popul- The public is a mess!
[01:27:10.179 --> 01:27:12.080]  A bunch of dumbed-down idiots!
[01:27:13.541 --> 01:27:15.083]  Who you can't even communicate with.
[01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:24.117]  It's 1984, Ingsoc, reduce the language down to where people don't even know what 2 plus 2 equals anymore.
[01:27:24.177 --> 01:27:24.918]  It's a joke!
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:26.741]  Mad wit.
[01:27:26.781 --> 01:27:28.443]  Finish up, then I'm gonna go to Brent and others.
[01:27:28.483 --> 01:27:29.285]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:27:30.151 --> 01:27:31.952]  Yeah, I wanted to comment on what you said.
[01:27:31.992 --> 01:27:44.880]  There's a big thing out there where people are losing their IQs, and yeah, people are getting dumber and they're being socialized, but I'd say it's not... Yeah, and here's the deal, just because they're dumb slobs doesn't give them a right to vote to make me a slave!
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:45.800]  Go ahead.
[01:27:46.781 --> 01:27:49.162]  I think what the problem is, it's emotional.
[01:27:49.502 --> 01:27:50.263]  It's character.
[01:27:50.383 --> 01:27:57.127]  They're so bombarded by everything that they can't possibly come to terms with the base, you know, what's really occurring.
[01:27:57.665 --> 01:28:00.446]  We know we've got a problem with treason with our government.
[01:28:01.326 --> 01:28:04.707]  We don't need to attack every policy and try and work our way back.
[01:28:04.767 --> 01:28:07.748]  We need to go right to the base where these people are responsible.
[01:28:07.768 --> 01:28:08.849]  They're supposed to be honorable.
[01:28:08.869 --> 01:28:09.869]  They're supposed to be honest.
[01:28:10.249 --> 01:28:11.029]  They swear an oath.
[01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:12.390]  That oath is binding.
[01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:16.711]  When you're in the military, you swear that oath, you know you could die defending your country.
[01:28:16.951 --> 01:28:18.472]  And it's the same thing for the Senate.
[01:28:19.068 --> 01:28:20.389]  They have the responsibility.
[01:28:20.429 --> 01:28:23.593]  It's the same thing for the House, for the executive, for the federal judicial.
[01:28:23.973 --> 01:28:25.194]  They swear that oath.
[01:28:25.214 --> 01:28:26.295]  They have the obligation.
[01:28:26.596 --> 01:28:27.697]  They're held in high esteem.
[01:28:27.717 --> 01:28:28.818]  They're given advantages.
[01:28:28.838 --> 01:28:31.541]  They're given the opportunity to have positions of authority.
[01:28:31.821 --> 01:28:33.082]  But that comes with a price.
[01:28:33.442 --> 01:28:35.865]  And they've all violated their oath.
[01:28:36.706 --> 01:28:38.528]  We don't need to worry about individual issues.
[01:28:38.548 --> 01:28:41.851]  You know, there's a theory in physics called conservation of energy.
[01:28:42.529 --> 01:28:46.053]  Totally proves the government and the media is complicit in 9-11.
[01:28:46.133 --> 01:28:48.796]  But nobody talks about a physical law because that's the end.
[01:28:48.837 --> 01:28:50.659]  There's no conspiracy theory.
[01:28:50.719 --> 01:28:52.461]  There's just physical law.
[01:28:52.901 --> 01:28:54.223]  And now we've got the same thing.
[01:28:54.503 --> 01:28:57.927]  We're dealing with conservation of energy in terms of social systems.
[01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:14.012]  Absolutely fell faster than a bowling ball falls and they forced underwriting laboratories and the federal government had to admit, architects and engineers, for 9-11 truth was correct, it did fall at free fall.
[01:29:14.773 --> 01:29:22.458]  I mean it basically and again at some points faster than free fall because they were blowing the floors out faster than it could even fall.
[01:29:23.078 --> 01:29:31.181]  So it fell at freefall, and for one second, when they blew up a bunch of floors at one time, faster than freefall, because it was just being blown out.
[01:29:32.722 --> 01:29:34.242]  I mean, I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:29:34.963 --> 01:29:36.983]  And it's... I hear you.
[01:29:37.104 --> 01:29:38.544]  Very interesting point, sir.
[01:29:38.984 --> 01:29:39.584]  God bless you.
[01:29:39.604 --> 01:29:40.605]  Please call back again.
[01:29:41.145 --> 01:29:43.306]  People can Google Mad Wit and find your radio show?
[01:29:44.186 --> 01:29:44.666]  I don't know.
[01:29:44.686 --> 01:29:45.507]  I guess he already hung up.
[01:29:46.467 --> 01:29:48.908]  I'm gonna try to... I apologize, folks, when I get in a bad mood.
[01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:49.668]  The show's real.
[01:29:49.949 --> 01:29:50.829]  I mean, I'm... you know.
[01:29:51.974 --> 01:29:53.896]  It's just, I'm mourning for the country.
[01:29:55.298 --> 01:29:58.861]  We're gonna come back and race through your calls, Brent and others.
[01:29:59.122 --> 01:30:02.125]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.046 --> 01:30:05.749]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.131 --> 01:30:16.097]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:16.297 --> 01:30:20.501]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:20.861 --> 01:30:25.426]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:25.826 --> 01:30:28.448]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:28.748 --> 01:30:33.931]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:34.192 --> 01:30:41.076]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:41.576 --> 01:30:45.359]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:45.719 --> 01:30:50.522]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:50.842 --> 01:30:51.683]  This is innovating.
[01:30:51.963 --> 01:30:59.265]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:59.445 --> 01:31:03.526]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:31:09.688 --> 01:31:16.751]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:16.851 --> 01:31:19.012]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:19.192 --> 01:31:24.295]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:24.475 --> 01:31:29.417]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:29.637 --> 01:31:32.721]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:32.981 --> 01:31:36.826]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:37.046 --> 01:31:41.291]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:48.740]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment.
[01:31:55.996 --> 01:32:02.361]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:42.805]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:42.965 --> 01:32:46.926]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:47.246 --> 01:32:48.706]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:49.026 --> 01:32:56.608]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:32:56.868 --> 01:32:57.728]  But for how long?
[01:32:58.008 --> 01:33:04.289]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:33:04.649 --> 01:33:07.470]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:33:12.865 --> 01:33:14.386]  We are on the march.
[01:33:14.747 --> 01:33:17.169]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:17.909 --> 01:33:21.693]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:23.074 --> 01:33:24.015]  So, here's the deal.
[01:33:26.377 --> 01:33:37.603]  We're under social engineering by technocrats that have a scientific plan to overtake humanity and basically engineer us into a suboid servant species.
[01:33:37.623 --> 01:33:41.165]  I don't know if that plan will be implemented fully, but they've gotten a lot of it done.
[01:33:41.945 --> 01:33:44.647]  They are training the military for the collapse of the U.S.
[01:33:44.687 --> 01:33:51.791]  by design to reorganize it into a totally fascist dictatorship, micromanaging every facet of your lives.
[01:33:52.799 --> 01:34:05.502]  with a socialist operating system using communist tactics and now the army is preparing to use lethal force against unarmed civilians close quote during full-scale riots in the US close quote
[01:34:07.188 --> 01:34:19.015]  And describes sniper response to the unarmed civilians and how they will shoot unarmed civilians during crowd control operations to psychologically terrorize the crowd and make them go away.
[01:34:19.395 --> 01:34:20.415]  They say they will shoot them.
[01:34:20.695 --> 01:34:22.977]  Of course, there's a lot of big problems with this.
[01:34:22.997 --> 01:34:26.899]  This is what the Nazis did, what the Soviets did, what the Romans did.
[01:34:26.919 --> 01:34:29.200]  This is what bad guys do.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.402]  And then, of course, it means then the rules of engagement.
[01:34:33.769 --> 01:34:34.829]  Turnabout's fair play.
[01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:37.851]  It means people will start shooting back and then a civil war starts.
[01:34:38.171 --> 01:34:41.913]  So they're being given orders that the Nazis wouldn't put on paper.
[01:34:43.853 --> 01:34:46.975]  The Nazis wouldn't put stuff like was in the Patriot Act on paper.
[01:34:47.315 --> 01:34:48.135]  They just did it.
[01:34:49.976 --> 01:34:51.917]  And I'm not comparing our military to Nazis.
[01:34:52.917 --> 01:34:54.978]  This is the orders that are going out.
[01:34:55.098 --> 01:34:56.039]  This is the training.
[01:34:57.071 --> 01:34:59.715]  Our military is freaking out over this.
[01:35:00.095 --> 01:35:02.198]  And they're freaking out over domestic psyops.
[01:35:02.539 --> 01:35:04.261]  They're freaking out about all of it.
[01:35:09.569 --> 01:35:11.331]  This is unbelievable.
[01:35:12.202 --> 01:35:17.403]  And if we don't make a big deal out of it and have a debate about it and say no, it will then become the official policy.
[01:35:17.703 --> 01:35:18.743]  Just like the NSA.
[01:35:19.143 --> 01:35:22.844]  I've been trying for 18 years to get people to admit the NSA was spying on everything.
[01:35:23.124 --> 01:35:28.465]  I told you how they were tracking you, with the eyewitnesses, with all the reports, with the whistleblowers.
[01:35:29.505 --> 01:35:30.846]  It all came out to be accurate.
[01:35:32.046 --> 01:35:32.806]  Every bit of it.
[01:35:39.287 --> 01:35:41.488]  And now, it's just, okay, we spy on everything you do.
[01:35:42.702 --> 01:35:46.745]  All new appliances are wireless, spying on you, smart meters, your phones.
[01:35:47.086 --> 01:35:49.027]  Yes, Google watches and listens to you.
[01:35:49.348 --> 01:35:50.248]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:35:50.348 --> 01:35:51.189]  It's ubiquitous.
[01:35:51.249 --> 01:35:54.011]  We have now been put into the artificial environment.
[01:35:54.232 --> 01:35:55.313]  We have adapted.
[01:35:55.553 --> 01:35:58.555]  They have used our adaptability against us.
[01:35:58.655 --> 01:36:00.777]  And I was told that by a top globalist.
[01:36:04.901 --> 01:36:05.362]  Off record.
[01:36:05.982 --> 01:36:08.786]  There's the headline from William Binney a month ago in the London Guardian.
[01:36:08.806 --> 01:36:09.967]  He was on our shows at the same thing.
[01:36:10.327 --> 01:36:11.429]  Number four at the NSA.
[01:36:11.749 --> 01:36:15.253]  The ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control.
[01:36:15.593 --> 01:36:22.181]  At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in US, says whistleblower William Binney.
[01:36:22.722 --> 01:36:24.484]  That's a totalitarian mentality.
[01:36:24.884 --> 01:36:25.204]  Folks,
[01:36:26.485 --> 01:36:32.447]  They were putting microphones up hidden inside streetlights in 1998 nationwide.
[01:36:32.947 --> 01:36:35.447]  They just got around to telling you about it this year.
[01:36:36.528 --> 01:36:37.348]  Austin, Texas.
[01:36:37.388 --> 01:36:38.488]  Chicago, Illinois.
[01:36:38.768 --> 01:36:40.228]  Los Angeles, California.
[01:36:40.589 --> 01:36:41.529]  Dallas, Texas.
[01:36:41.609 --> 01:36:42.889]  Boston, Massachusetts.
[01:36:43.309 --> 01:36:44.490]  New York, New York.
[01:36:45.010 --> 01:36:46.330]  Trenton, New Jersey.
[01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:47.750]  Miami, Florida.
[01:36:48.311 --> 01:36:51.111]  Folks, that's not the only secret projects.
[01:36:51.171 --> 01:36:53.772]  They jacked the water with hundreds of chemicals.
[01:36:55.854 --> 01:37:00.497]  No one would put up with all this if we weren't being given daily chemicals!
[01:37:00.697 --> 01:37:02.258]  Do you understand me?!
[01:37:05.099 --> 01:37:09.502]  And I will not sit here like a guinea pig and be messed with anymore!
[01:37:10.356 --> 01:37:18.201]  The microphones are real, the chemicals are real, the army manuals are real, the NSA is real, the cancer viruses and the vaccines are real.
[01:37:18.461 --> 01:37:21.042]  Real, real, real, real, real!
[01:37:21.703 --> 01:37:22.643]  And you know what I'm doing?
[01:37:22.784 --> 01:37:24.164]  I'm just here to warn people.
[01:37:24.425 --> 01:37:26.246]  I don't know what to do about all this stuff.
[01:37:26.506 --> 01:37:27.727]  I can't figure it all out.
[01:37:27.947 --> 01:37:35.291]  I don't know how to run all my reporters, and run all the websites, and run all the films, and run the news, and run everything else.
[01:37:35.571 --> 01:37:36.512]  All this crap!
[01:37:37.112 --> 01:37:39.754]  Well, the whole damn country goes to hell in a handbasket!
[01:37:40.632 --> 01:37:43.516]  All of you people out there under attack, you better figure that out.
[01:37:44.957 --> 01:37:46.779]  Let's go to Brenton, FEMA Region 6.
[01:37:46.839 --> 01:37:49.583]  I guess that's somewhere around Texas, where Texas used to be.
[01:37:49.803 --> 01:37:52.146]  I mean, I live under FEMA!
[01:37:53.007 --> 01:37:54.348]  I live under NORTHCOM!
[01:37:54.549 --> 01:37:57.632]  Those aren't words to hype things up and scare people.
[01:37:57.912 --> 01:37:59.574]  This isn't a science fiction movie.
[01:37:59.755 --> 01:38:00.516]  This is real!
[01:38:03.874 --> 01:38:05.415]  A lot of people just say, well that's the way it is.
[01:38:05.435 --> 01:38:06.816]  Yeah, I know a lot of this stuff's true.
[01:38:06.896 --> 01:38:09.598]  I've seen it for myself, but what am I going to do about it?
[01:38:10.218 --> 01:38:18.924]  See, as soon as you have that attitude, and I know why you got that attitude, as soon as it's too big, it's game over.
[01:38:18.944 --> 01:38:26.710]  I just hope that everybody out there who works for the system gets off your little power trips, because I see it in your eyes and your actions.
[01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:28.471]  You people are the biggest jokes of all.
[01:38:28.871 --> 01:38:31.213]  You think you're on the winning team?
[01:38:32.483 --> 01:38:34.104]  Boy, you're dumber than you act, then.
[01:38:34.925 --> 01:38:36.826]  Dumber than you look.
[01:38:36.986 --> 01:38:38.547]  No one is on a winning team.
[01:38:38.848 --> 01:38:39.688]  This is evil.
[01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:41.530]  Even the people at the top of this.
[01:38:43.531 --> 01:38:44.532]  Game over, man!
[01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:44.952]  Game over!
[01:38:44.972 --> 01:38:45.493]  They know.
[01:38:45.693 --> 01:38:47.534]  They're into exterminism and pure evil.
[01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:48.695]  They're in love with death.
[01:38:49.335 --> 01:38:50.977]  The people at the top of this know.
[01:38:51.377 --> 01:38:52.678]  They know what the real plan is.
[01:38:53.478 --> 01:38:54.599]  These are some sick people.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.021]  Alright, let's go ahead.
[01:38:57.041 --> 01:38:58.662]  We are going to become gods.
[01:39:00.223 --> 01:39:00.604]  Period.
[01:39:01.681 --> 01:39:02.301]  You don't like it?
[01:39:02.341 --> 01:39:02.761]  Get off.
[01:39:06.362 --> 01:39:08.363]  Brenton, FEMA Region 6, you're on the air.
[01:39:08.423 --> 01:39:08.843]  Go ahead.
[01:39:09.703 --> 01:39:10.644]  Alex, how are you, brother?
[01:39:11.084 --> 01:39:12.064]  I'm not in a good mood here.
[01:39:12.784 --> 01:39:14.505]  Yeah, I hear you, man.
[01:39:14.605 --> 01:39:19.286]  I wanted to speak on the race world, but I'd also like to touch on an important issue, I believe, right now.
[01:39:19.326 --> 01:39:28.269]  You know, I think this is all tied in and basically what we're seeing with this rapid demise and, you know, policy after policy and action after action being
[01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:54.410]  orchestrated against the American people is basically an administration that is just throwing crap against the wall to see what will stick you know history is written by the winners and I guarantee you Soros, Obama, the Clintons, Bernanke's, all these people that are involved with the policies that are destroying America financially they don't want to go down in history you know we still speak of
[01:39:55.010 --> 01:40:10.383]  Romans from thousands of years ago, battles that they fought, people's names, the names of soldiers and emperors, and America makes Rome look tiny in comparison as far as our military might and our world politics and our influence.
[01:40:11.024 --> 01:40:22.774]  And I know these people do not want their names going down in history thousands of years from now, you know, Bernanke being spoken about how his policies collapsed the greatest empire on the face of the earth.
[01:40:23.214 --> 01:40:25.895]  Well, but I mean, you say it's our empire, and I do that too.
[01:40:25.955 --> 01:40:27.015]  Like, why are we in Iraq?
[01:40:27.035 --> 01:40:29.056]  Why are we... We're not doing anything.
[01:40:29.096 --> 01:40:30.036]  We supply the money.
[01:40:30.436 --> 01:40:31.617]  We supply the engineers.
[01:40:32.797 --> 01:40:37.819]  Our grandfathers and fathers built the technocracy we're in.
[01:40:38.119 --> 01:40:47.282]  They thought they were building a technocracy to beat communism, but the truth was the technocrats had built the communism to be the threat to build up the police state here.
[01:40:48.345 --> 01:40:52.326]  And again, the Globalists have all written books, from Brzezinski to Carl Quigley, admitting that.
[01:40:52.886 --> 01:40:53.946]  That's not my opinion.
[01:40:55.406 --> 01:41:02.607]  We've got Bilderberg documents from the 1960s, where they were meeting with all the labor union heads and the big bankers, and it's all admitted.
[01:41:02.647 --> 01:41:05.568]  We've been smuggled dead U.S.
[01:41:05.648 --> 01:41:11.369]  Senators' notes, hundreds of pages of it, that we published, just how they run the whole deal.
[01:41:12.569 --> 01:41:13.189]  It's official.
[01:41:13.249 --> 01:41:17.210]  In America, affluence equals influence.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:22.202]  A new study shows policy caters to the desires of wealthy Americans.
[01:41:22.662 --> 01:41:23.142]  Really?
[01:41:23.162 --> 01:41:24.523]  Oh my gosh!
[01:41:24.623 --> 01:41:24.903]  U.S.
[01:41:24.943 --> 01:41:25.944]  News and World Report!
[01:41:26.004 --> 01:41:26.584]  My gosh!
[01:41:27.004 --> 01:41:28.705]  Next they're going to tell me the sky's blue.
[01:41:29.025 --> 01:41:30.086]  But here's the problem.
[01:41:30.466 --> 01:41:32.187]  We don't have a virtuous elite.
[01:41:37.569 --> 01:41:38.410]  I hear you Alex.
[01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:41.731]  And if I may, I'd like to touch on the rape war issue as well.
[01:41:42.472 --> 01:41:42.832]  The what?
[01:41:44.056 --> 01:41:50.083]  The coming race war, what I believe is an orchestrated color war, basically.
[01:41:50.423 --> 01:42:00.595]  You know, one thing that you've taught us info warriors, you know, you're not just out here waking up people, Alex, but you're teaching us how to do better research while we are awake.
[01:42:00.775 --> 01:42:01.356]  And so there's
[01:42:02.017 --> 01:42:15.485]  More to it than what you give yourself credit for but what I see is you know when whenever the border was collapsed I started calling that there was going to be a race war to my co-workers and basically everybody I had ran into because
[01:42:16.395 --> 01:42:26.022]  The way I look at it is, if you're bringing in MS-13 gang members, and everybody knows the atrocities that they commit in Central America, there's no debating that.
[01:42:26.363 --> 01:42:28.864]  There's only two things that these people are good for.
[01:42:28.884 --> 01:42:32.067]  One is going to be drug running, and the other is going to be murder.
[01:42:32.367 --> 01:42:37.230]  And what I see happening is, you know, from 2001 onward, we've heard this whole
[01:42:39.492 --> 01:42:40.593]  We're good to go.
[01:43:01.312 --> 01:43:06.136]  MS-13 by the mainstream organizations that cover the programming.
[01:43:06.417 --> 01:43:17.886]  You'll notice how they throw in little nuggets of information like, oh yes, the MS-13 gang members are roofers, or they pour concrete, or they do this insinuating that these are the people that you work with.
[01:43:17.946 --> 01:43:22.510]  These are the people that are by your side every single day and you just don't know it.
[01:43:22.811 --> 01:43:25.933]  So I look for the one of the next attacks to be MS-13
[01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:57.555]  We know we could look at Central America and see the atrocities they've committed there and I basically look for that to come to America and then that will bring up the terror level game and then it'll be no longer you know an arid person that somebody's looking for you know that they want to have an underlying racism or any kind of personal issue about it's going to go to the guy that you know you eat lunch with every single day not knowing if him or his family is ms-13 that'll bring
[01:43:58.275 --> 01:44:03.397]  Tear into where they could orchestrate their plan the way that I see it unfolding.
[01:44:05.278 --> 01:44:06.818]  Hi Harry, I appreciate your call.
[01:44:07.258 --> 01:44:08.299]  I mean, that's what they're doing.
[01:44:08.319 --> 01:44:10.139]  They're opening the borders, letting the crime in.
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:15.001]  Infowars.com article, Ferguson protester lofts ISIS sign.
[01:44:18.923 --> 01:44:20.163]  We have the video of that.
[01:44:20.203 --> 01:44:21.343]  You can punch up my computer.
[01:44:21.363 --> 01:44:24.244]  You can show TV viewers what I'm talking about.
[01:44:25.505 --> 01:44:25.665]  But,
[01:44:27.654 --> 01:44:29.835]  This is the type of garbage that we're dealing with.
[01:44:31.216 --> 01:44:40.360]  You got ISIS signs in front of the White House, but the TSA is checking baby diapers while our government gives heat-seeking missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[01:44:43.061 --> 01:44:46.943]  It's all a destabilization program to then bring in
[01:44:48.186 --> 01:44:53.470]  The police state that's going to be pointed at producing Americans, the final enemy of the globalists.
[01:44:53.490 --> 01:45:04.677]  People that have not succumbed to their brainwashing and their weakness and their... everyone just checking their Facebooks all day or watching MTV and... or the Kardashians.
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:12.803]  Just all the adult, childlike people just everywhere, bumbling around mindlessly.
[01:45:14.036 --> 01:45:17.378]  The whole system is just there to just wreck the human mind.
[01:45:17.458 --> 01:45:19.358]  It's absolutely an abomination.
[01:45:19.839 --> 01:45:24.801]  We're going to go to Henry, and Bella, and Terry, and others.
[01:45:24.861 --> 01:45:30.604]  We've got Joe Biggs, and Marcos Morales, as well as Mikhail Phelan.
[01:45:32.156 --> 01:45:42.199]  And of course, Kit Daniels there, doing a great job honing in, investigating where the provocateurs are, who's behind the maul-off cocktails, who's making the threats.
[01:45:44.259 --> 01:45:45.440]  Are the police involved?
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:49.481]  We know there's a Federal Command Center there and 50 FBI agents running the show.
[01:45:50.161 --> 01:45:51.841]  And we know more reporters have been arrested.
[01:45:51.861 --> 01:45:57.783]  We know the demonstrators, some of them have been attacking CNN reporters and others, MSNBC reporters.
[01:45:59.163 --> 01:46:01.024]  Joe Biggs here to give us a breakdown.
[01:46:02.586 --> 01:46:05.348]  On what he's witnessed for Infowars.com, Joe?
[01:46:06.489 --> 01:46:08.370]  Joe Biggs, Infowars.com, St.
[01:46:08.410 --> 01:46:09.370]  Louis, Missouri.
[01:46:10.131 --> 01:46:12.132]  Last night, it was very interesting.
[01:46:12.773 --> 01:46:18.697]  We pulled up to the Martial Law Command Center and I wanted to see if I could get a glimpse of any of the National Guard.
[01:46:19.137 --> 01:46:26.922]  And one of the things that was very apparent is still the police are ten times more militarized
[01:46:27.427 --> 01:46:35.630]  The military itself, the National Guard, had on ACUs, which is the Army Combat Uniform, and a sidearm, and that is it.
[01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:45.573]  No riot shields, no full battle rattle, no Kevlar helmets, no batons, no sniper rifles, no M4s, nothing like that at all whatsoever.
[01:46:46.374 --> 01:46:52.696]  They were just sitting there, directing the flow of traffic in and out of the compound last night.
[01:46:56.087 --> 01:46:57.028]  What else have you witnessed?
[01:46:58.209 --> 01:47:09.017]  Uh, well, last night, uh, we did witness, towards the end of the night, around 11 or so, uh, someone tried to light the barbecue, uh, restaurant on fire.
[01:47:09.477 --> 01:47:13.401]  It's directly to the right of the QT gas station.
[01:47:13.461 --> 01:47:21.447]  A looter came in, lit something on fire, and if I'm not mistaken, he tried to throw something inside the building as well, and light that place on fire.
[01:47:21.467 --> 01:47:24.049]  Uh, maybe five minutes later,
[01:47:24.713 --> 01:47:30.278]  A whole swarm of SWAT team members flew down the road, got over there and put that out.
[01:47:30.559 --> 01:47:41.629]  We heard gunshots soon thereafter, and some of the rioters came and lit a section of the road, or pretty much the entire road, going back into the condominiums where Mike Brown was killed.
[01:47:41.649 --> 01:47:43.350]  They lit that on fire to try to keep
[01:47:44.525 --> 01:47:51.092]  The MRAPs and the police from driving down into that neighborhood and that is the area where people were shot at last night.
[01:47:52.073 --> 01:47:55.116]  I didn't see any police officers fire any weapons.
[01:47:55.156 --> 01:47:58.540]  They actually maintained muzzle awareness for the first time last night.
[01:47:58.956 --> 01:48:00.417]  They had their weapons at the low ready.
[01:48:00.457 --> 01:48:01.778]  They weren't pointing at anybody.
[01:48:02.198 --> 01:48:04.599]  A lot of officers were out with 9 mils in their hands.
[01:48:04.619 --> 01:48:07.641]  They actually had them down beside their waists.
[01:48:08.101 --> 01:48:17.486]  I'm sure that's due to the negative publicity they have been getting for their unnecessary roughness and just running around pointing weapons at people.
[01:48:20.108 --> 01:48:22.129]  This is just incredible information, Joe.
[01:48:22.689 --> 01:48:23.950]  No one has this info.
[01:48:24.130 --> 01:48:25.711]  We need to get this in a text report.
[01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:27.150]  I have no idea.
[01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:28.391]  I'm just telling you what I saw.
[01:48:28.411 --> 01:48:29.511]  That's what Marcos and I saw right there.
[01:48:29.531 --> 01:48:31.051]  There were press there around us.
[01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:35.953]  So if they're not saying anything about it, they're just not doing their job whatsoever.
[01:48:54.226 --> 01:49:05.892]  You know, we sat around the side, the MRAPs came in, and the police were yelling on the radio, if you're a credentialed media, you can be there, just don't impede their job, and stay on the side of the road.
[01:49:05.952 --> 01:49:13.977]  So Marcos and I stayed off on the side of the road, and we filmed them lighting stuff on fire, and then running back into the neighborhood and doing that.
[01:49:14.397 --> 01:49:15.598]  But most of these people,
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.681]  Weren't even from the area.
[01:49:17.721 --> 01:49:20.922]  These are all outsiders who are just running around trying to start stuff.
[01:49:21.282 --> 01:49:24.064]  I even spoke to the guy who owned that barbecue spot.
[01:49:24.384 --> 01:49:26.385]  He ran over and he said, you've been here for a while.
[01:49:27.085 --> 01:49:28.046]  Do I need to go over there?
[01:49:28.066 --> 01:49:29.246]  Should I be worried about anything?
[01:49:29.266 --> 01:49:31.847]  And I was like, I believe that the police have put it out.
[01:49:32.147 --> 01:49:37.750]  I know they put out the one on the outside and I could hear them smash the rest of the glass to get in to put that one out.
[01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:41.392]  I was like, I think it's safe to say that your restaurant will still be there tomorrow.
[01:49:41.812 --> 01:49:42.972]  But he was concerned.
[01:49:42.993 --> 01:49:43.953]  He said he was tired of this.
[01:49:44.363 --> 01:49:46.804]  He's tired of waking up and living in a war zone.
[01:49:47.064 --> 01:49:49.065]  He just wants things to get back to normal.
[01:49:49.365 --> 01:49:53.247]  But it's these outsiders who are coming in and terrorizing the community.
[01:49:53.587 --> 01:49:58.010]  And they've completely taken away from what the protest even was in the first place.
[01:50:01.331 --> 01:50:04.993]  Now, we know some of the Black Panthers, the new Black Panther Party, has been calling for violence.
[01:50:05.933 --> 01:50:08.034]  As best we can tell, who are these outsiders?
[01:50:08.975 --> 01:50:09.575]  Well, it's funny.
[01:50:10.075 --> 01:50:11.176]  They're calling for the violence.
[01:50:11.761 --> 01:50:14.643]  But, as soon as it gets around midnight, you know what they're doing?
[01:50:14.723 --> 01:50:15.204]  They're leaving.
[01:50:16.545 --> 01:50:33.097]  They're out there trying to hype people up, they're telling them that, you know, the white man is suppressing them, and that, you know, that we're bad, blah blah blah blah, getting everybody hyped up, get these youngsters' emotions running hot, and then as soon as it's about to snap and go off, those guys go home.
[01:50:34.437 --> 01:50:44.339]  And they let these guys get all angry and agitated and run around, start lighting Molotov cocktails, start throwing bottles, start throwing bricks, and it gets out of their control.
[01:50:44.359 --> 01:50:45.900]  And they just go home and watch it from TV.
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:50.321]  You know, last night, the media was in all their designated areas.
[01:50:50.441 --> 01:50:52.321]  And then once the shooting happened, I can understand.
[01:50:52.341 --> 01:50:56.122]  The police said, hey, we need you guys to get back because they're shooting at us.
[01:50:57.022 --> 01:50:57.362]  Fine.
[01:50:57.843 --> 01:50:58.283]  Got that.
[01:50:58.323 --> 01:50:59.763]  So we moved back out of the way.
[01:51:00.737 --> 01:51:04.641]  They were like, you need to go into the, uh, the marked-off area for press.
[01:51:04.661 --> 01:51:05.802]  That's a safe spot right now.
[01:51:05.822 --> 01:51:07.163]  Stay there, Joe.
[01:51:07.203 --> 01:51:09.746]  Come back and tell us what happened last night straight ahead from Ferguson.

[01:52:09.073 --> 01:52:10.314]  Another major health threat.
[01:52:10.334 --> 01:52:15.238]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:52:15.298 --> 01:52:17.961]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:24.767]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:52:25.027 --> 01:52:27.909]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:52:27.929 --> 01:52:30.932]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:52:30.952 --> 01:52:32.974]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:52:33.014 --> 01:52:35.796]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:52:35.896 --> 01:52:41.419]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:52:41.639 --> 01:52:45.141]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:52:45.161 --> 01:52:48.103]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:53:09.886 --> 01:53:13.867]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[01:53:13.987 --> 01:53:18.048]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[01:53:18.188 --> 01:53:23.489]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.

[01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:39.331]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:53:39.411 --> 01:53:43.753]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:53:43.913 --> 01:53:49.535]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:53:49.615 --> 01:53:52.977]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:53:53.197 --> 01:53:55.758]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:55.858 --> 01:54:00.699]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:54:00.839 --> 01:54:01.060]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:02.440]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:54:22.197 --> 01:54:27.562]  Yeah, there have been more fireworks behind the scenes today than on the air.
[01:54:27.582 --> 01:54:29.883]  I'm genuinely in a bad mood.
[01:54:30.003 --> 01:54:33.326]  And that's normal when you've got declassified Army documents.
[01:54:50.959 --> 01:54:56.183]  Written in April of this year, preparing to mow down unarmed demonstrators nationwide.
[01:54:59.064 --> 01:55:04.308]  And the way the PSYOP will work is they'll be, well, you just must be against our military.
[01:55:04.388 --> 01:55:05.769]  Our military would never do that.
[01:55:07.338 --> 01:55:08.998]  That's not what we're debating here.
[01:55:09.278 --> 01:55:11.419]  That's the default brainwashing out there.
[01:55:12.199 --> 01:55:13.459]  Who wrote this?
[01:55:13.639 --> 01:55:17.200]  Why was it written by the Department of the Army at the Pentagon?
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:23.481]  Why is this the official crowd control manual being issued to everybody down to privates?
[01:55:24.861 --> 01:55:27.021]  This is outrageous.
[01:55:31.322 --> 01:55:32.982]  The point is, answer the manual.
[01:55:33.382 --> 01:55:34.683]  Answer why this is being put out.
[01:55:35.003 --> 01:55:36.123]  Don't change the subject.
[01:55:38.697 --> 01:55:39.778]  That's how the public mind works.
[01:55:39.858 --> 01:55:41.179]  Oh, our military will never do that.
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:43.080]  That'll never happen.
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:43.561]  Really.
[01:55:43.821 --> 01:55:44.942]  We'll never have Obamacare.
[01:55:44.962 --> 01:55:47.083]  We'll never have a president ruling by fiat with open borders.
[01:55:47.283 --> 01:55:49.085]  We'll never have a private Federal Reserve looting us.
[01:55:49.325 --> 01:55:51.287]  We'll never, we'll never, we'll never, we'll never, we'll never.
[01:55:51.647 --> 01:55:55.710]  It will all come true because we don't get upset and say no to it.
[01:55:56.997 --> 01:56:08.066]  And the country club class that thinks it's part of the elite is too busy driving their Cadillacs and Mercedes and playing tennis all day and playing golf all day and just hoping that everything doesn't implode around them.
[01:56:08.286 --> 01:56:13.371]  We're going to lose everything because you're too busy clutching on to your tennis rackets.
[01:56:14.071 --> 01:56:15.213]  And on to your golf clubs.
[01:56:15.954 --> 01:56:18.797]  As if that's all that matters is getting your stroke right.
[01:56:19.218 --> 01:56:23.323]  Or taking your wife out to the theater to act like you're high class.
[01:56:23.784 --> 01:56:26.027]  You need to be politically involved right now.
[01:56:26.347 --> 01:56:29.151]  This country is burning down politically around us.
[01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:38.473]  Joe Biggs is there in Ferguson, reporting on the provocateuring, all the things we're seeing.
[01:56:38.973 --> 01:56:42.135]  Look, do whatever you can, but I'd go up and talk to those new Black Panther morons.
[01:56:42.915 --> 01:56:45.696]  And just, you know, they act all powerful, like they're in charge.
[01:56:45.736 --> 01:56:48.198]  Everyone stands around like it's a press conference because they're arrogant.
[01:56:48.858 --> 01:56:51.600]  We need people to go up to them and say, man, why are you race baiting?
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:53.160]  Hey, you answer the question.
[01:56:53.481 --> 01:56:56.602]  You know, it's well known you guys get Ford Foundation money to stir this up.
[01:56:56.882 --> 01:57:01.505]  Why don't you come out here tonight when stuff's getting burned down and actually witness what you're stirring up?
[01:57:02.581 --> 01:57:07.664]  Because it's outrageous how they're helping set up the police state against their own people.
[01:57:08.084 --> 01:57:09.645]  It's a total PSYOP.
[01:57:10.226 --> 01:57:14.808]  Some of the new Black Panther people are PSYOPs and are actual operatives.
[01:57:14.928 --> 01:57:15.909]  Others are useful idiots.
[01:57:15.929 --> 01:57:17.250]  What do you think is going on, Joe Biggs?
[01:57:18.791 --> 01:57:20.632]  I 100% agree with you, Alex.
[01:57:21.052 --> 01:57:22.593]  That's the only way it could possibly be.
[01:57:23.311 --> 01:57:32.215]  I mean, just when you get out there and you see them marching and you see them, you know, putting their fists up in the air and they're running around, you know, talking about, you know, their agenda and what they want to do.
[01:57:32.275 --> 01:57:39.098]  And you can see that the young, the youth around them getting amped up and, you know, hopping up and down and pulling their mask over their face.
[01:57:39.118 --> 01:57:42.960]  And you can see that, you know, that these guys are getting them agitated.
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.321]  But then at night time, I noticed I don't see one.
[01:57:46.368 --> 01:57:48.429]  New Black Panther suit out there.
[01:57:48.449 --> 01:57:49.670]  I don't see the patches.
[01:57:49.690 --> 01:57:51.151]  I don't see the buttons on anybody.
[01:57:51.571 --> 01:57:54.013]  They're out there throughout the day getting everybody amped up.
[01:57:54.033 --> 01:57:55.994]  At the nighttime, they are gone.
[01:57:57.115 --> 01:57:59.917]  You know, last night was pretty intense.
[01:57:59.997 --> 01:58:01.358]  They started shooting gas at us.
[01:58:01.998 --> 01:58:12.465]  And as they had us move back into the area because of our safety issues, that they called it, in the neighborhood, once we got out of sight, out of mind,
[01:58:13.348 --> 01:58:21.394]  There were, I was reading Twitter and there were tweets from people living in that community saying that the police were going from house to house searching in there.
[01:58:21.634 --> 01:58:28.519]  And there were also reports of, you know, people looters lighting garbage cans on fire out there in the area.
[01:58:29.079 --> 01:58:34.843]  So I definitely plan on going back out there today and see what I can find in that neighborhood to confirm those reports.
[01:58:35.724 --> 01:58:39.347]  So the reports are that the police are going inside people's houses without warrants?
[01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:42.190]  That's what we heard last night from a few different people.
[01:58:42.230 --> 01:58:44.410]  We'll try to get some eyewitnesses to that.
[01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:45.771]  Stay there, we'll be back in one minute.
[01:58:45.791 --> 01:58:47.871]  Joe Biggs reporting from Ferguson, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.293 --> 01:58:56.254]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.804 --> 01:59:05.848]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[01:59:05.908 --> 01:59:09.270]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:10.951]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[01:59:10.971 --> 01:59:17.275]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spears.
[01:59:17.355 --> 01:59:23.259]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:59:23.399 --> 01:59:27.162]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:59:27.362 --> 01:59:30.264]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:59:30.444 --> 01:59:38.450]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:59:38.710 --> 01:59:40.772]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:59:40.832 --> 01:59:41.853]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:59:42.233 --> 01:59:50.979]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:00:04.989 --> 02:00:07.731]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.717 --> 02:00:16.337]  Big Brother.
[02:00:17.018 --> 02:00:18.039]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.799 --> 02:00:19.920]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:21.361]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.141 --> 02:00:23.022]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.682 --> 02:00:27.325]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.865 --> 02:00:31.928]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:49.721 --> 02:00:51.965]  We're taking your phone calls coming up.
[02:00:52.386 --> 02:00:57.594]  I want to get our guests moved to 20 after the police state expert because I want to finish these calls that have been holding patiently.
[02:00:58.035 --> 02:00:59.558]  I want to finish up with Joe Biggs.
[02:01:00.706 --> 02:01:02.246]  Joe, so much is happening.
[02:01:02.266 --> 02:01:04.307]  You guys are doing a great job.
[02:01:04.327 --> 02:01:07.708]  I just think it's important to not just report when you're here with me.
[02:01:08.108 --> 02:01:15.149]  When you're doing these great live streams, just keep reporting and getting the word out on all the things you've been witnessing.
[02:01:15.690 --> 02:01:20.151]  And I think it's integral to go prove the provocateuring's going on.
[02:01:20.191 --> 02:01:21.251]  We know it's already going on.
[02:01:21.671 --> 02:01:22.671]  We've proved it some.
[02:01:23.751 --> 02:01:28.132]  And then, I think, bring those videos to the police and try to confront them.
[02:01:28.253 --> 02:01:29.633]  Why aren't you going after
[02:01:30.765 --> 02:01:40.994]  The provocateurs, because if people are running around calling for violence and stirring things up, that's yelling fire in a theater.
[02:01:42.876 --> 02:01:52.605]  And I understand the establishment wants there to be rioting and problems, because then that gives them an excuse to have tanks and all these uniforms and the surveillance and all the rest of it.
[02:01:53.365 --> 02:01:53.866]  Joe Biggs.
[02:01:55.447 --> 02:02:02.569]  I was trying to ask multiple people last night what the sole purpose of the National Guard, what their duty was going to be.
[02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:05.910]  In Ferguson, none of the soldiers there.
[02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:12.512]  The funny thing is, I would say about 90% of the National Guard soldiers I saw were specialists and below, so that's E4 and below.
[02:02:12.532 --> 02:02:14.632]  They're not even non-commissioned officers yet.
[02:02:16.193 --> 02:02:17.993]  These guys had no idea what they were doing.
[02:02:18.013 --> 02:02:24.695]  They're just a bunch of kids sitting around being told that they have to go stand out here and move an orange cone back and forth.
[02:02:25.131 --> 02:02:30.593]  You know, at the press conference last night, I got a question in, Marcos and Kit, we all got questions in.
[02:02:32.254 --> 02:02:37.316]  You could tell whenever we asked questions, he just got this look on his face because they were real questions.
[02:02:37.556 --> 02:02:40.637]  They were questions like, is there going to be a curfew tomorrow?
[02:02:41.577 --> 02:02:44.658]  You know, how are you guys doing overall, you know, with your health?
[02:02:45.019 --> 02:02:48.700]  You know, we were asking real questions like, why are First Amendment rights being violated?
[02:02:49.212 --> 02:02:53.876]  You know, and then he went on to say that because there was a threat, there was a danger.
[02:02:54.216 --> 02:02:54.776]  Well, you know what?
[02:02:54.836 --> 02:02:57.619]  No one held a gun to his head and made him join the police force.
[02:02:57.959 --> 02:03:02.342]  He should have known, just like I did when I joined the military, that there's a very good chance I could die.
[02:03:02.803 --> 02:03:05.765]  Just like I volunteered to come here to report on what's going on.
[02:03:06.065 --> 02:03:13.811]  There's a good chance that I could get shot, but I'm willing to take that chance to do my job so the American people and the world can see the truth of what's happening.
[02:03:14.191 --> 02:03:15.573]  All he did was dance around stuff.
[02:03:15.593 --> 02:03:18.555]  The entire press conference last night was BS.
[02:03:19.184 --> 02:03:21.225]  He was just ducking and dodging, real issues.
[02:03:21.565 --> 02:03:28.247]  He had this whole little heartfelt script that he'd written up that took him about 10 minutes to read through where he almost tried to bring up tears.
[02:03:29.127 --> 02:03:30.308]  It was just a complete mockery.
[02:03:30.328 --> 02:03:31.348]  It was a psy-op.
[02:03:31.388 --> 02:03:38.431]  It's like a nation of lawyers and wannabe lawyers and pitchmen and BSers and no one's being real.
[02:03:38.871 --> 02:03:40.491]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[02:03:40.791 --> 02:03:45.013]  The crowd is, you know, degenerating and more and more thugs are showing up.
[02:03:45.393 --> 02:03:48.534]  Well, he mentioned that he was upset with how the media was doing their job.
[02:03:49.034 --> 02:03:51.477]  You know, and I'm sitting here just like, I'm standing right beside him.
[02:03:51.537 --> 02:03:53.219]  I mean, I'm on every channel you can think of.
[02:03:53.799 --> 02:03:57.684]  And I'm sitting here like, you know, I would talk and I'd be like, what do you mean?
[02:03:58.447 --> 02:04:00.089]  We're doing our job, we're reporting.
[02:04:00.409 --> 02:04:03.131]  And you're saying that people are getting in the way and they don't need to be there.
[02:04:03.492 --> 02:04:04.513]  Negative!
[02:04:04.793 --> 02:04:10.598]  You guys are trying to move us out of the way so we can't see what's going on, like the going into people's houses without a warrant.
[02:04:11.039 --> 02:04:11.559]  Going around them.
[02:04:11.579 --> 02:04:14.021]  He's out there whining, oh why is the media being mean to us?
[02:04:14.302 --> 02:04:19.907]  Well why are you shooting reporters with rubber bullets on purpose and pointing guns at them and arresting them in McDonald's?
[02:04:21.708 --> 02:04:24.451]  If you have nothing to hide, then why are you worried about people filming?
[02:04:26.121 --> 02:04:26.681]  They're scared.
[02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:29.402]  They know that their tactics are completely screwed up.
[02:04:31.143 --> 02:04:36.446]  They are... And we're showing video too, though, of the protesters being jerks.
[02:04:37.006 --> 02:04:38.287]  You know, I gotta be honest, Joe.
[02:04:38.947 --> 02:04:42.008]  I said I'd probably go out there this week, but I've got so much to run here at the office.
[02:04:42.368 --> 02:04:44.009]  And I've been to all sorts of stuff like this before.
[02:04:44.329 --> 02:04:46.470]  Some of the trolls are like, that's your go and you're scared.
[02:04:46.930 --> 02:04:47.291]  You know what?
[02:04:47.371 --> 02:04:47.891]  I am scared.
[02:04:48.905 --> 02:04:52.668]  Because if I went there and some cop pointed a gun at me for no reason, I'd get mad.
[02:04:53.089 --> 02:04:55.751]  And if some thug came up and slapped my camera, I'd punch him in the face.
[02:04:56.151 --> 02:05:00.235]  So I just want to say I commend you guys not hauling off and hitting anybody.
[02:05:01.275 --> 02:05:05.619]  It was funny, one of the police officers, the riot police officer, goes, InfoWars, oh my God!
[02:05:05.639 --> 02:05:08.762]  Hold on, I'm going to come back and finish with you, and I promise I'm going to the calls on our guest.
[02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:17.272]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:48.882]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:05:49.022 --> 02:05:50.042]  Talk about the effects.
[02:05:50.362 --> 02:05:51.843]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:05:51.863 --> 02:05:53.503]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:05:53.783 --> 02:05:54.844]  I feel like I look better.
[02:05:54.904 --> 02:05:55.524]  I feel better.
[02:05:55.544 --> 02:05:56.704]  I feel sexier.
[02:05:57.024 --> 02:05:57.404]  I love it.

[02:06:28.446 --> 02:06:29.387]  Crime directive.
[02:06:29.467 --> 02:06:30.868]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.028 --> 02:06:33.850]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:36.952]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:06:37.112 --> 02:06:39.274]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:39.394 --> 02:06:40.895]  These people are assaulting us!
[02:06:40.915 --> 02:06:43.215]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:43.756 --> 02:06:45.436]  They are never going to stop.

[02:07:04.403 --> 02:07:05.763]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:07:05.783 --> 02:07:06.524]  You can feel it.
[02:07:09.525 --> 02:07:10.766]  Another major health threat.
[02:07:10.786 --> 02:07:15.688]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:15.748 --> 02:07:18.389]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:18.429 --> 02:07:25.212]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:25.472 --> 02:07:28.333]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:28.453 --> 02:07:31.375]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:31.395 --> 02:07:33.416]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:33.436 --> 02:07:36.297]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:36.357 --> 02:07:41.859]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:42.079 --> 02:07:45.581]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:45.601 --> 02:07:48.582]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:08:18.119 --> 02:08:20.781]  I apologize, I had the callers holding in the last hour.
[02:08:21.401 --> 02:08:23.463]  Waging war for part of a corruption.
[02:08:23.523 --> 02:08:25.424]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.805 --> 02:08:31.129]  But we are going right back to your calls here in a moment, finishing up with Joe Biggs.
[02:08:31.649 --> 02:08:33.511]  There's so much world news going on.
[02:08:35.253 --> 02:08:36.814]  Planes are flying over D.C.
[02:08:36.854 --> 02:08:38.815]  for aerospace defense tests.
[02:08:40.356 --> 02:08:47.140]  Russia tests service-to-air missiles and military exercises designed basically for Ukraine.
[02:08:49.141 --> 02:09:01.589]  Three armed regiments carried the test fires of the S-400 Triumph and S-300 service-to-air missile defense spokesman said, so that's all gearing up on the border with Ukraine.
[02:09:04.053 --> 02:09:06.415]  Ferguson Police say they will keep arresting reporters.
[02:09:09.538 --> 02:09:16.383]  Police in Ferguson arrest Getty photographer Scott Olson in broad daylight.
[02:09:18.765 --> 02:09:19.966]  This is really getting ridiculous.
[02:09:22.267 --> 02:09:31.073]  It's all about controlling everything and controlling the information and we need kill switches and all the cell phones to turn them off so they can turn all the cell phones off in a town and do whatever they want.
[02:09:31.093 --> 02:09:33.375]  I mean, it's just so authoritarian.
[02:09:33.875 --> 02:09:36.037]  And then I realized why I've been so upset all day.
[02:09:37.218 --> 02:09:39.740]  The Army document we're going to talk about with an expert coming up.
[02:09:41.325 --> 02:09:45.408]  But Joe Biggs, recap what you witnessed yesterday, last night.
[02:09:45.428 --> 02:09:47.710]  You guys worked until the early morning hours.
[02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:50.833]  Police doing door-to-door searches without warrants.
[02:09:52.174 --> 02:09:54.976]  Looters setting fire to buildings trying to block roads.
[02:09:55.296 --> 02:09:56.217]  You've described a lot.
[02:09:56.377 --> 02:09:57.118]  Recap it.
[02:09:57.818 --> 02:10:01.501]  And then you were getting into some of the riot police getting excited to see InfoWars.
[02:10:02.682 --> 02:10:07.746]  Yeah, when we got in there last night, we set up as quick as we could.
[02:10:07.806 --> 02:10:11.009]  There were some demonstrators out there, some protesters walking up and down the street.
[02:10:11.431 --> 02:10:12.712]  That quickly dissipated.
[02:10:12.732 --> 02:10:21.678]  That kind of went away and a mid-sized crowd kind of stayed at the police line right in front of the McDonald's.
[02:10:22.039 --> 02:10:29.544]  Now then back down the street about, you know, half of a quarter of a mile down that way, there was another group of people in the QT parking lot.
[02:10:30.084 --> 02:10:36.429]  There was a lot of police officers lined up and down on the sides of the road and for some reason they all lined up and then shot down to the QT.
[02:10:36.809 --> 02:10:40.452]  They formed a big line and sat there and then I could hear them over the loudspeakers
[02:10:40.945 --> 02:10:43.266]  Anybody in the QT parking lot disperse.
[02:10:43.706 --> 02:10:46.388]  Anyone who doesn't do that is subject to arrest and or more.
[02:10:46.408 --> 02:10:50.349]  They said that as part of the sentence again, which they've only recently added.
[02:10:50.449 --> 02:10:51.050]  It's Saturday.
[02:10:53.391 --> 02:10:57.072]  Once we were told to move, Marco stayed back and he continued filming.
[02:10:57.252 --> 02:11:00.074]  I got back and I was trying to find Kit and Mikhail.
[02:11:00.714 --> 02:11:05.096]  And I was filming from that area as they were finally setting up the blockade.
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:10.464]  And I got on the radio, we got some little walkie-talkies, and I'm like, Marcos, they are starting to arrest people.
[02:11:10.844 --> 02:11:15.768]  And in front of me, I'm used to hearing there's a guy on the ground, they're wrestling him down and zip-tying him up.
[02:11:16.474 --> 02:11:18.335]  And I'm sitting here on the radio and I'm like, Marcos, where are you at?
[02:11:18.375 --> 02:11:19.195]  They are arresting people.
[02:11:19.215 --> 02:11:20.915]  They don't care who you are now at this point.
[02:11:21.236 --> 02:11:22.476]  They are just in a bad mood.
[02:11:22.516 --> 02:11:24.197]  They are just trying to arrest everybody.
[02:11:24.617 --> 02:11:30.879]  Marcos is just walking up nonchalantly with his camera to the police line and the guys are just like really literally about to arrest him.
[02:11:31.119 --> 02:11:33.780]  And he's pointing at the camera like, you know, hello, this is obvious.
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:35.400]  I'm a journalist.
[02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:40.662]  But that doesn't mean anything to these guys because they were ripping off press off their bulletproof vests.
[02:11:41.147 --> 02:11:42.750]  Off of one of the vice reporters last night.
[02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:44.272]  They said, this doesn't mean anything.
[02:11:44.573 --> 02:11:45.635]  And ripped it off the chest.
[02:11:46.136 --> 02:11:47.959]  And, you know, we're trying to throw the guy around.
[02:11:48.359 --> 02:11:50.323]  And then in the press conference last night...
[02:11:51.078 --> 02:11:57.121]  The, uh, Captain Johnson said, he's like, how do you, he's like, there's so many people nowadays that, uh, claim to be media.
[02:11:57.321 --> 02:12:03.543]  He's like, obviously if I look at a guy and he's got a $50,000 rig on his shoulder, well then that automatically means that he's a journalist.
[02:12:04.063 --> 02:12:10.446]  But nowadays, and then he looked at me and he goes, you've got guys walking around with vests on, holding an iPhone or something like that.
[02:12:10.766 --> 02:12:11.827]  I don't know who they are.
[02:12:12.127 --> 02:12:13.607]  You know, that doesn't mean that you're a journalist.
[02:12:13.647 --> 02:12:19.610]  So apparently having a $50,000 camera is press credentials to these guys.
[02:12:20.427 --> 02:12:27.191]  So anyone else who doesn't have that giant rig on their shoulder is fair game for these guys to arrest as far as he was concerned.
[02:12:27.451 --> 02:12:31.174]  And for those that don't know, those giant rigs are now being phased out.
[02:12:31.714 --> 02:12:35.476]  Even movie companies use the Canon cameras that we use.
[02:12:36.217 --> 02:12:36.537]  They're like $10,000.
[02:12:39.304 --> 02:12:40.625]  It's just asinine.
[02:12:40.746 --> 02:12:50.476]  I mean, CNN reporters do Skype, iPhone videos, but this is Dianne Feinstein saying that they will decide who is press and who will get protection.
[02:12:50.916 --> 02:12:57.484]  The talk radio doesn't get it, that the citizen journalists don't get it, the Drugs Report doesn't get it, that InfoWars doesn't get it.
[02:12:58.064 --> 02:13:01.025]  Doesn't matter if we break major news stories every day.
[02:13:01.085 --> 02:13:03.846]  It doesn't matter if we have 20 million listeners overall every week.
[02:13:04.326 --> 02:13:08.507]  It doesn't matter if we have 800 million YouTube views now, conservatively.
[02:13:08.527 --> 02:13:10.668]  400 and something million on one channel.
[02:13:11.008 --> 02:13:13.569]  It doesn't matter if we got 3 million Facebook followers.
[02:13:13.649 --> 02:13:14.109]  Followers.
[02:13:14.769 --> 02:13:16.330]  None of that matters.
[02:13:16.750 --> 02:13:20.291]  It doesn't matter that I'm in two major Hollywood films.
[02:13:20.592 --> 02:13:24.573]  It doesn't matter I've been a consultant to TV and movies.
[02:13:24.973 --> 02:13:28.034]  It doesn't matter because they will decide.
[02:13:28.074 --> 02:13:30.675]  Well, the truth is they're arresting CNN reporters.
[02:13:30.975 --> 02:13:32.736]  They're arresting Washington Post reporters.
[02:13:32.996 --> 02:13:34.497]  They're arresting Getty reporters.
[02:13:34.877 --> 02:13:37.478]  They're arresting... The truth is they're just playing games.
[02:13:38.118 --> 02:13:40.039]  And this shows how they define things.
[02:13:40.559 --> 02:13:45.320]  Our government has never, in a riot situation, targeted reporters.
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:53.223]  Unless they were in an arrest situation, in between the cops, that is interfering with their duty.
[02:13:54.023 --> 02:13:58.045]  It is not interfering with the duty to be 200 yards away.
[02:13:58.065 --> 02:13:59.425]  This is asinine.
[02:13:59.465 --> 02:14:02.907]  This is interfering with our First Amendment and it's crazy.
[02:14:03.267 --> 02:14:04.687]  Why do you think they're doing this?
[02:14:04.747 --> 02:14:06.868]  Is this just the hubris?
[02:14:07.348 --> 02:14:12.711]  Because it'd be one thing if they were going and arresting or even roughing up people, burning down businesses.
[02:14:13.031 --> 02:14:13.671]  That's arson.
[02:14:13.691 --> 02:14:14.571]  That can kill people.
[02:14:15.111 --> 02:14:15.992]  They would be cheered.
[02:14:16.312 --> 02:14:18.533]  But instead they sit there and let them burn stuff down.
[02:14:20.066 --> 02:14:21.807]  And then come over and attack the press.
[02:14:22.307 --> 02:14:22.627]  Why?
[02:14:23.087 --> 02:14:24.948]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[02:14:25.288 --> 02:14:30.170]  They sent about 7 or 8 officers into the neighborhood where the shooting was and the fires.
[02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:40.254]  Meanwhile, there were probably 50 or 60 police officers dealing with those pesky journalists trying to exercise their First Amendment rights, Alex.
[02:14:40.595 --> 02:14:46.337]  Last night was disgusting because I saw a complete and total collapse of the First Amendment.
[02:14:46.792 --> 02:14:50.813]  They corralled us into the area, they got us in the free speech zone, the media area.
[02:14:51.293 --> 02:14:57.614]  Once we got there, they then came over to the speakers and said, now you have to all leave immediately.
[02:14:57.934 --> 02:15:04.356]  And the police came out, the riot police, forced us out of the media area, into our vehicles that made us go down a road.
[02:15:04.756 --> 02:15:15.878]  And then I was like, all right, well, I want to go back to the main media site at the Martial Law Command Center so I can find out what's going on while we're having our rights taken away from us and we're not being allowed to do our job.
[02:15:16.676 --> 02:15:29.704]  So we pulled out of that area after being forced out by the police and had to go on this 20 minute drive, this runaround around Ferguson because every time we go to a road, the cops would be blocking off like, oh no, you have to go down the interstate and go to the next exit.
[02:15:29.764 --> 02:15:32.606]  And by the way, the crew here is doing an incredible job as well.
[02:15:32.626 --> 02:15:33.927]  I don't know how they're able to do it.
[02:15:34.307 --> 02:15:40.151]  As you talk, they go to the hours of video that you guys uploaded live and they are showing
[02:15:40.911 --> 02:15:52.758]  The police talking to you when you were talking to them, they looked so angry and hateful that you would dare even want to be a mile away from where stuff is going.
[02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:53.738]  Unbelievable.
[02:15:54.198 --> 02:15:56.240]  Yeah, they're completely trying to keep us from doing our job.
[02:15:56.300 --> 02:16:02.603]  Meanwhile, you know, Captain Johnson's getting on TV badmouthing the media saying that we're not doing our job.
[02:16:02.863 --> 02:16:05.525]  Well, he swore to an oath to uphold the Constitution.
[02:16:05.825 --> 02:16:09.567]  And I want to say, sir, you're not doing your job at all whatsoever.
[02:16:10.185 --> 02:16:13.488]  What you're doing is a disgrace to Americans and to the world.
[02:16:15.313 --> 02:16:17.274]  Out of control, out of control, out of control.
[02:16:17.674 --> 02:16:21.417]  And just giving us this oop de oop, this runaround around town, just driving.
[02:16:21.657 --> 02:16:23.038]  People were all over the place.
[02:16:23.718 --> 02:16:26.320]  I mean, there's never going to be traffic at 2 o'clock in the morning.
[02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:28.981]  And the only reason there was because they just kept redirecting people.
[02:16:29.461 --> 02:16:32.663]  Journalists from every organization were trying to figure out what's going on.
[02:16:32.943 --> 02:16:38.867]  And then when we got out there, they held us out there until 2.30 in the morning because he was upset with how the media were doing their job.
[02:16:39.127 --> 02:16:43.750]  Then he came out with a bad attitude, moving some microphones around and all that stuff.
[02:16:44.310 --> 02:16:45.310]  Very unprofessional.
[02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:49.031]  The whole thing is just a complete joke of what they're doing.
[02:16:49.731 --> 02:16:57.073]  They're definitely hiding stuff, and like I said, the only way to get to the truth sometimes, you gotta skip and hop and climb over a few fences.
[02:16:57.953 --> 02:17:03.394]  But that's the only way to do it, because these guys are completely taking away to where we have to go to that extreme.
[02:17:03.474 --> 02:17:04.894]  I have to hide in the woods.
[02:17:04.974 --> 02:17:05.815]  I have to do something.
[02:17:06.015 --> 02:17:07.695]  This is how totalitarianism works.
[02:17:10.510 --> 02:17:13.391]  One guy does something wrong on the block, everybody gets in trouble.
[02:17:13.571 --> 02:17:15.352]  That's Nazi Germany, that's Soviet Russia.
[02:17:16.833 --> 02:17:24.716]  You get thugs from out of town tearing stuff up, and as you said, they've got more police to harass the media than they do to chase down the thugs.
[02:17:25.136 --> 02:17:27.477]  That's a major news angle, Joe, that you witnessed that.
[02:17:27.497 --> 02:17:32.759]  We need to get a report out with one of our writers about that, that you witnessed
[02:17:33.854 --> 02:17:39.779]  It sounds like you said about five to one, the police presence was for the media and not for the out-of-town looters.
[02:17:40.159 --> 02:17:44.763]  I think that's major evidence that they may be provocateurs working for the feds.
[02:17:45.144 --> 02:17:46.805]  The feds have a history of doing that, Joe.
[02:17:47.666 --> 02:17:53.471]  Yeah, they were more concerned about us than they were about the fires, about what was really going on out there.
[02:17:53.531 --> 02:17:59.336]  Their attention seemed to be purely on us and being right there in that media area.
[02:18:01.437 --> 02:18:03.239]  You know, one of the questions someone asked is,
[02:18:03.783 --> 02:18:09.605]  Is... I think one of the ladies, she goes, she goes, sir, um, you said that the curfew was lifted.
[02:18:10.105 --> 02:18:10.866]  And he goes, yes.
[02:18:11.406 --> 02:18:14.947]  She's like, well, there's no one on the streets after midnight.
[02:18:15.747 --> 02:18:17.208]  You force everybody out of there.
[02:18:17.328 --> 02:18:18.808]  Isn't that in fact a curfew?
[02:18:19.369 --> 02:18:21.269]  Um, uh, uh, uh, next question.
[02:18:21.629 --> 02:18:22.610]  And he wouldn't even answer that.
[02:18:23.650 --> 02:18:25.811]  All they do is duck and dodge real questions.
[02:18:25.831 --> 02:18:26.711]  That's all they did.
[02:18:26.991 --> 02:18:29.052]  It was a complete and total sigh up to the teeth.
[02:18:30.069 --> 02:18:32.971]  I'm looking at video you guys shot of these National Guard people.
[02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:34.792]  They look like kids.
[02:18:35.152 --> 02:18:35.733]  Yeah, they're kids.
[02:18:35.753 --> 02:18:36.273]  They're babies.
[02:18:36.653 --> 02:18:40.596]  A lot of the one guy who has been filming out here all week with me that I've gotten to know
[02:18:41.007 --> 02:18:43.749]  He was an ex-marine and he just kept sitting down on the ground.
[02:18:43.769 --> 02:18:46.051]  He's like, Hey, doesn't your mom know that you're out here?
[02:18:46.111 --> 02:18:47.532]  Did you get a permission slip for this?
[02:18:48.053 --> 02:18:50.535]  You know, don't you, don't you need to be doing some kind of homework or something?
[02:18:50.895 --> 02:18:51.876]  Cause they were just babies.
[02:18:52.436 --> 02:18:54.638]  I mean, the guys, they didn't even know what they were doing out there.
[02:18:54.658 --> 02:18:55.999]  I would ask them simple questions.
[02:18:56.460 --> 02:18:58.061]  I'm like, Hey, I used to be in the military.
[02:18:58.081 --> 02:19:00.823]  I was like, you know, what are you guys, where'd you guys come from?
[02:19:00.843 --> 02:19:06.307]  Um, and I was like, well, so who's your point of contact for, uh, the media?
[02:19:06.327 --> 02:19:08.369]  Uh, I don't know who that is.
[02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:09.610]  I was like, well, you all came together.
[02:19:09.650 --> 02:19:10.571]  You came from the same unit.
[02:19:11.147 --> 02:19:12.667]  Why don't you know these simple questions?
[02:19:13.087 --> 02:19:14.668]  Well, this is a ticking time bomb.
[02:19:14.948 --> 02:19:17.848]  They're out there with Beretta sidearms on 9mm.
[02:19:18.369 --> 02:19:20.809]  They have a run-in with any of these thugs or anybody.
[02:19:21.129 --> 02:19:25.630]  This could turn into a shooting situation like Kent State, and then all hell's going to break loose.
[02:19:26.210 --> 02:19:27.831]  Exactly, because they're going to be very nervous.
[02:19:27.851 --> 02:19:29.391]  They're not going to know how to act under fire.
[02:19:29.411 --> 02:19:32.812]  I asked anyone if they'd ever been on active duty before.
[02:19:33.212 --> 02:19:34.072]  Most of them just said no.
[02:19:35.067 --> 02:19:38.649]  When I asked if they'd ever been in combat, most of them just shook their head no.
[02:19:39.169 --> 02:19:53.075]  So these are kids who have never been in any kind of really life experience, and they get put in a situation with a gun, they get thrown in front of people actually intending to do harm to them, and someone's gonna get shot.
[02:19:54.236 --> 02:20:00.579]  It's definitely a recipe for disaster in Ferguson now that the National Guard children are here.
[02:20:02.338 --> 02:20:04.038]  I gotta say, I saw the commanding officer.
[02:20:04.078 --> 02:20:06.039]  He looked like he started shaving maybe last week.
[02:20:06.819 --> 02:20:09.140]  I've never seen National Guard that looks this green.
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:10.700]  Yeah, they are.
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:13.961]  They're fresh off the, uh, fresh out.
[02:20:16.241 --> 02:20:17.722]  Well, Joe, I want you to be careful.
[02:20:18.042 --> 02:20:19.182]  No heroics tonight.
[02:20:20.142 --> 02:20:25.444]  Just try to follow what they say, even though it's unconstitutional and a bunch of baloney.
[02:20:26.044 --> 02:20:30.645]  Well, the biggest thing I try to do is I try to listen to when I hear somebody say something really good.
[02:20:31.092 --> 02:20:33.534]  And then I run over and go like, hey, can you say that again real quick?
[02:20:33.914 --> 02:20:35.115]  And then I try to catch it that way.
[02:20:35.395 --> 02:20:40.719]  And with the police, you've just got to be quiet and you've got to listen, because they use the radios very low.
[02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:48.765]  And you can pick on a lot of the radio chatter that they're doing, their communication, and you can hear them saying stuff that's a little bit out there.
[02:20:49.066 --> 02:20:50.827]  So... What are you hearing them say?
[02:20:50.867 --> 02:20:51.628]  What are you hearing them say?
[02:20:51.648 --> 02:20:55.030]  Well, you can hear them, you know, saying, hey, we need to get these guys out of here.
[02:20:55.290 --> 02:20:56.151]  And they're looking at us.
[02:20:56.618 --> 02:21:01.942]  And then they run over to the media and then one minute the guy on the speaker saying, Hey, if you're credentialed media, you're fine.
[02:21:02.222 --> 02:21:07.986]  And then all of a sudden you get some guys pull up in an SUV and jump out and they're like, Oh, you can hear him whisper.
[02:21:08.027 --> 02:21:08.847]  And then they're like, no, no, no.
[02:21:08.887 --> 02:21:09.848]  Now you guys need to go.
[02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:14.812]  And then they load up on that truck with the seven guys and then go into the town or into that, uh, side road.
[02:21:15.392 --> 02:21:20.696]  So it's, it's what the mainstream media doesn't do is pay attention to every little detail.
[02:21:21.175 --> 02:21:35.925]  That's why it's good that we have the four people out here today, that we can leave people in the sheep pen, the main stream media area, so we can hear what the police tell the media, and then they rate it back to us saying, hey, this is just what they told us.
[02:21:36.005 --> 02:21:37.626]  Are you actually seeing that on the ground?
[02:21:37.906 --> 02:21:41.189]  And then I go and say, hey, no, that's definitely not happening, or it is.
[02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:45.852]  So we have a pretty good system set up now with information being sent back and forth.
[02:21:46.701 --> 02:21:52.365]  Well, this is not a soap opera we're here following, even though in the scheme of things it's been blown out of proportion.
[02:21:52.645 --> 02:22:00.050]  We're analyzing the PSYOP from every angle to try to educate and inform listeners and viewers who aren't informed.
[02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:01.752]  A lot of our listeners are more informed than we are.
[02:22:02.793 --> 02:22:09.456]  But it's all part of a real media process of breaking down historically what's happening here.
[02:22:09.816 --> 02:22:18.519]  But at the same time, people are getting my punditry, where I really do genuinely blow up on air, flipping out over the fact that I'm going to the phone calls and we're going to break.
[02:22:18.559 --> 02:22:19.699]  I just skip the network break.
[02:22:19.739 --> 02:22:21.700]  Then we're going to go to your calls.
[02:22:23.381 --> 02:22:25.462]  But I realize I'm so upset, Joe.
[02:22:25.942 --> 02:22:31.184]  In closing, you were leaving yesterday as this article broke the new army training manual.
[02:22:32.406 --> 02:22:46.337]  It's public, where they say they will kill unarmed civilians during full-scale riots as a PSYOP, how to wound or kill people to scare crowds away.
[02:22:46.978 --> 02:22:55.404]  So they're now putting war crime stuff off the chart in documents to the point of when I read this document I start stuttering on air.
[02:22:56.405 --> 02:23:05.817]  Because it is such a horrific crisis to know that we've now moved to this point and that there's no media covering this.
[02:23:06.258 --> 02:23:12.306]  Drudge has been linked to this since yesterday, so we know all the media, radio, TV, print is seeing this.
[02:23:12.887 --> 02:23:13.768]  We've got, you know,
[02:23:14.108 --> 02:23:16.130]  3-4,000 comments on the article.
[02:23:16.590 --> 02:23:21.774]  We can look on the metrics and see that about 800,000 people have read the article or visited it.
[02:23:22.555 --> 02:23:32.062]  And there's no coverage of an official army training manual saying the new policy is to kill unarmed Americans.
[02:23:32.142 --> 02:23:33.804]  I mean, this is over the top.
[02:23:34.504 --> 02:23:38.607]  I mean, the fact that we're using CS gas by militarized police
[02:23:39.867 --> 02:23:46.509]  In America, when NATO does not allow our military forces to use it on any enemy combatants, it's crazy in itself.
[02:23:47.329 --> 02:23:50.130]  That lets you know of what they're trying to go to now here.
[02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:53.951]  So it doesn't, that doesn't, I can believe every single bit of that.
[02:23:54.251 --> 02:24:02.093]  I've also had a couple of my military buddies over the past day contact me and say, hey, I've actually seen that recently, so they're familiar with that.
[02:24:05.185 --> 02:24:06.045]  No, it's been issued.
[02:24:06.125 --> 02:24:08.166]  It's officially approved for public release.
[02:24:08.646 --> 02:24:10.246]  Distribution is unlimited.
[02:24:11.867 --> 02:24:14.947]  It was secret in April, and they just decided to put it out last Friday.
[02:24:15.147 --> 02:24:17.928]  And the funny thing is, though, is when people see that, they're still gonna deny it.
[02:24:18.408 --> 02:24:19.208]  And it's right there.
[02:24:19.428 --> 02:24:20.209]  And you can look it up.
[02:24:20.909 --> 02:24:25.210]  You can go to an army base, and you can see it right there in black and white.
[02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:27.210]  But the mainstream media will go, nah.
[02:24:28.171 --> 02:24:28.671]  That's not real.
[02:24:29.211 --> 02:24:29.891]  That's not gonna happen.
[02:24:30.916 --> 02:24:37.104]  That's right, you could go to an army base and go to their information office and they could show you an official book of this.
[02:24:37.124 --> 02:24:40.668]  No, they would give it to you like they would one of those Gideon Bibles at a hotel.
[02:24:41.209 --> 02:24:42.891]  I mean, they're not even going to think twice about it.
[02:24:43.091 --> 02:24:46.956]  Oh yeah, here you go, here's a handbook on domestic terrorism against civilians.
[02:24:46.996 --> 02:24:47.277]  Here you go.
[02:24:49.479 --> 02:24:50.020]  They're not going to care.
[02:24:53.108 --> 02:24:54.850]  I literally cannot talk at this point.
[02:24:55.771 --> 02:24:56.992]  It's so over the top.
[02:24:57.252 --> 02:25:01.095]  It's just... They're training to mow innocent people down.
[02:25:01.115 --> 02:25:06.260]  And again, I'm not... The people are so dumb now that it's feasible.
[02:25:06.901 --> 02:25:11.825]  People now are so dumb now, from their Facebook, their TVs...
[02:25:12.668 --> 02:25:28.140]  All this stuff, reality TV, just being lazy and not caring whatsoever that the government can literally come out with documents like this and put them in front of your face and wave it around and the bulk of the population will sit there and go, nah.
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:31.442]  I've literally talked to people about stuff like this.
[02:25:31.822 --> 02:25:32.022]  Nah.
[02:25:32.503 --> 02:25:33.283]  And show it to them.
[02:25:33.523 --> 02:25:34.044]  Nah, that's not real.
[02:25:35.282 --> 02:25:35.802]  That's impossible.
[02:25:35.822 --> 02:25:42.688]  Well, this shows they're going to be light-handed for a while to sell the military on it, because again, we're not saying the military wants to do this.
[02:25:43.088 --> 02:25:44.169]  We're not saying they're bad.
[02:25:44.209 --> 02:25:45.710]  The media they do cover will spin it.
[02:25:46.050 --> 02:25:49.853]  Alex says the army wants to line men, women, and kids up and kill them.
[02:25:49.933 --> 02:25:50.173]  No!
[02:25:50.754 --> 02:25:52.295]  They put this on paper.
[02:25:52.575 --> 02:25:55.237]  The issue is, this is the official manual.
[02:25:55.497 --> 02:25:56.598]  This is the policy.
[02:25:56.858 --> 02:26:00.962]  So don't throw it onto the troops and say that I said they want to kill women and children.
[02:26:01.562 --> 02:26:02.744]  Or unarmed people.
[02:26:02.764 --> 02:26:04.146]  We just want to know why they wrote it.
[02:26:04.306 --> 02:26:06.809]  Why is this the new policy?
[02:26:06.849 --> 02:26:07.090]  Yes.
[02:26:07.170 --> 02:26:07.691]  Exactly.
[02:26:07.751 --> 02:26:10.835]  Don't change the subject because I know how the PSYOP works out there.
[02:26:10.855 --> 02:26:13.078]  Well, our military would never do that.
[02:26:13.338 --> 02:26:13.679]  Bull!
[02:26:15.001 --> 02:26:16.202]  During a total collapse...
[02:26:17.168 --> 02:26:24.673]  When there's 10,000 people coming up your rural road to loot your town, I'll be out there to defend my family.
[02:26:25.073 --> 02:26:38.662]  Don't you think that's funny that that's coming out now in the wake of what's going on in Ferguson with excessive militarized police and their unprofessionalism and how they're acting out of control and how they're restricting media and how they're taking our rights away.
[02:26:39.062 --> 02:26:41.003]  This is not a coincidence.
[02:26:41.384 --> 02:26:42.725]  This is all coming out now.
[02:26:43.765 --> 02:26:45.426]  Well, look at how they're aiming
[02:26:47.335 --> 02:26:51.716]  Look at how they're aiming rifles at our reporters in broad daylight and smiling.
[02:26:52.256 --> 02:26:55.497]  They've told them, get ready to mow everybody down, and this is all some beta test.
[02:26:55.737 --> 02:26:56.777]  This is crazy town!
[02:26:57.357 --> 02:27:01.919]  And the style of experts are testing the police and the military to see if they'll do it.
[02:27:01.959 --> 02:27:02.179]  Joe?
[02:27:03.139 --> 02:27:09.020]  Yes, I've had sniper rifles pointed at me the first day, or the second day I got here, right at my chest.
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:15.782]  I'm sitting here filming, and then the other night, Saturday night, I had two separate laser beams on my back while I'm running.
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:18.320]  With my hands up.
[02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:20.421]  And I'm a journalist.
[02:27:20.561 --> 02:27:22.541]  And I have media written all over me.
[02:27:23.421 --> 02:27:27.782]  I've even checked in with those same police officers just prior to that.
[02:27:28.062 --> 02:27:29.742]  So they knew exactly who I was.
[02:27:30.182 --> 02:27:32.403]  They are teaching them that we're the enemy.
[02:27:32.803 --> 02:27:37.204]  And as you said, they had 5-1 cops for the media instead of the looters last night.
[02:27:37.704 --> 02:27:38.424]  This is incredible.
[02:27:38.664 --> 02:27:39.724]  Rob Due just came in here.
[02:27:39.744 --> 02:27:40.864]  He must have some breaking news.
[02:27:41.644 --> 02:27:43.745]  Rob Due, the news director for the TV side.
[02:27:43.765 --> 02:27:44.065]  Go ahead.
[02:27:44.505 --> 02:27:47.587]  Well, this came a tip from Thomas in Miami, Florida.
[02:27:47.627 --> 02:27:48.988]  He works for Florida News Service.
[02:27:49.248 --> 02:27:56.012]  And he said, please remind Alex, reporters do not just have First Amendment rights, but also Fourth Estate rights to report to the general public.
[02:27:57.033 --> 02:28:00.635]  And they can basically go inside police lines like general public cannot.
[02:28:00.755 --> 02:28:03.277]  Reporters can do that under the Fourth Estate rights.
[02:28:04.058 --> 02:28:07.940]  Well, in the past, because the police said, oh, we want reporters here.
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:09.281]  We want you to see what really happened.
[02:28:09.301 --> 02:28:10.101]  I want to get the information.
[02:28:10.121 --> 02:28:11.342]  Well, this is unprecedented.
[02:28:11.402 --> 02:28:11.822]  Exactly.
[02:28:12.123 --> 02:28:14.144]  Going after reporters is unprecedented.
[02:28:14.324 --> 02:28:18.806]  And they just don't want people to see what's going on, in case the police mess up and there's a reporter there catching it.
[02:28:19.146 --> 02:28:20.687]  Because now it goes out instantaneous.
[02:28:20.847 --> 02:28:29.712]  I mean, the last few nights watching what's going on with the Ustream, Livestream, everybody just putting stuff up, it really is amazing.
[02:28:29.812 --> 02:28:32.273]  And the media is really showing its power at this point.
[02:28:32.773 --> 02:28:34.274]  And you can tell because the cops are scared.
[02:28:34.294 --> 02:28:35.475]  The cops are scared of the media.
[02:28:35.495 --> 02:28:37.115]  They keep pushing them back and pushing them back.
[02:28:37.155 --> 02:28:42.058]  And it's disgusting, but it also shows how much power we have by just being there and showing up with cameras.
[02:28:42.538 --> 02:28:52.765]  Joe, the way to do this is to go befriend three or four strategic houses in the area and even offer to give them some money to let you use their houses as bases at night.
[02:28:53.185 --> 02:28:56.347]  That's the way to stay in there and then to go get those reports done.
[02:28:56.667 --> 02:28:57.648]  So you've done a great job.
[02:28:57.668 --> 02:28:58.629]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:28:58.649 --> 02:29:04.492]  We need to get these phone calls, but great job and just stay safe tonight or stay outside the police lines.
[02:29:04.953 --> 02:29:06.974]  But as you said, they just keep pushing you back.
[02:29:07.314 --> 02:29:10.997]  Pretty soon they'll push you so far south, you'll be back in Austin, Texas.
[02:29:11.650 --> 02:29:13.432]  Yeah, I have a plan for tonight though.
[02:29:13.452 --> 02:29:16.615]  I think I'm going to get back in the side road where that neighborhood is.
[02:29:17.035 --> 02:29:26.884]  So when they do start trying to sweep everybody out, I'll be back in that area and I can go ahead and start filming them and watch them when they come into the neighborhood and I want to see exactly what they're doing.
[02:29:27.204 --> 02:29:30.147]  I've already seen a bush, a yard where I want to hide.
[02:29:30.447 --> 02:29:32.129]  I'm just going to get down, lay down and film.
[02:29:33.766 --> 02:29:39.950]  Well that sounds like somewhat of a plan, but you'll have the homeowner's rights at your back if you make friends with the locals.
[02:29:40.510 --> 02:29:41.631]  Don't you think that's what needs to be done?
[02:29:42.492 --> 02:29:42.732]  Yeah.
[02:29:43.601 --> 02:29:44.001]  Exactly.
[02:29:44.561 --> 02:29:47.122]  Well, we'll all be watching tonight at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:47.463 --> 02:29:52.224]  Pray for Joe Biggs and the rest of the crew there in Ferguson, Missouri.
[02:29:52.265 --> 02:29:56.726]  We have a guest coming up, an expert on the police state, and an author.
[02:29:56.946 --> 02:29:58.107]  Stay with us in your phone calls.
[02:29:58.147 --> 02:29:58.667]  I'll get to you.
[02:29:59.007 --> 02:29:59.908]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.408 --> 02:30:01.988]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.929 --> 02:30:05.610]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.938 --> 02:30:15.880]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:20.282]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:30:20.642 --> 02:30:25.224]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:30:25.624 --> 02:30:28.246]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:30:28.546 --> 02:30:33.728]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:30:33.989 --> 02:30:40.892]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:30:41.393 --> 02:30:45.155]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:30:45.515 --> 02:30:50.297]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:50.637 --> 02:30:51.478]  This is innovating.
[02:30:51.758 --> 02:30:59.044]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:30:59.244 --> 02:31:03.307]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:31:03.507 --> 02:31:08.712]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:31:09.574 --> 02:31:13.097]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:13.237 --> 02:31:17.200]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:18.982]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:19.302 --> 02:31:26.888]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:31:27.168 --> 02:31:28.009]  But for how long?
[02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:34.554]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:31:34.954 --> 02:31:37.757]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:31:39.676 --> 02:31:46.561]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[02:31:46.962 --> 02:31:54.287]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[02:32:08.877 --> 02:32:15.963]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:32:16.063 --> 02:32:18.224]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:32:18.404 --> 02:32:23.508]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:32:23.688 --> 02:32:28.632]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:32:28.832 --> 02:32:31.893]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:32:32.153 --> 02:32:36.014]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:32:36.234 --> 02:32:40.475]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:32:40.555 --> 02:32:50.558]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:32:50.778 --> 02:32:53.299]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:32:53.459 --> 02:32:57.581]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:56.132 --> 02:33:58.615]  I appreciate Cheryl Chumley joining us.
[02:33:58.635 --> 02:34:08.145]  We're going to have her on for an hour, but the police state is unfolding so fast that we've only got her on for 30 minutes, but I want to invite her back on for a full hour in the next few weeks.
[02:34:08.185 --> 02:34:09.386]  She was also on with David Knight.
[02:34:09.946 --> 02:34:13.931]  You know, I know a lot about the police state, and folks,
[02:34:15.233 --> 02:34:19.014]  You know, out there might think that I couldn't learn something or you couldn't learn something from a book.
[02:34:19.674 --> 02:34:30.876]  It's put out by World Net Daily, forwarded by Congressman Louie Gohmert, Police State USA, How Orwell's Nightmare is Becoming Our Reality, Cheryl K. Chumley.
[02:34:31.416 --> 02:34:41.458]  And the fact that it's forwarded by a Texas Republican, who is pro-law and order, shows how the libertarian conservative movement is getting concerned about the militarization.
[02:34:41.498 --> 02:34:42.338]  That's what's upsetting
[02:34:43.769 --> 02:34:52.071]  Power structure and the feds, they want to federalize the police and they want to use disasters like Ferguson as a pretext to do that.
[02:34:53.952 --> 02:34:56.433]  So we're not here to demonize the police.
[02:34:57.453 --> 02:35:04.255]  We're also not here to support them attacking reporters or attacking peaceful demonstrators.
[02:35:05.370 --> 02:35:14.496]  Five to one last night, police for the reporters, for the police that we saw going after looters and people burning down businesses.
[02:35:15.637 --> 02:35:22.422]  So again, the looters are horrible, but then does that mean the police can look at our reporters who are clean cut and who are polite?
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:28.481]  And who they've even checked in with, and sit there looking at him like they want to kill him, and pointing guns at him.
[02:35:29.102 --> 02:35:32.303]  I mean, if I was there, I'd be like, what is your problem?
[02:35:33.063 --> 02:35:34.543]  Why are you looking at me like that?
[02:35:34.643 --> 02:35:35.504]  I'm an American.
[02:35:36.504 --> 02:35:37.584]  I've done nothing to you.
[02:35:37.744 --> 02:35:38.404]  I'm the press.
[02:35:38.444 --> 02:35:40.745]  How dare you point a gun at me?
[02:35:41.105 --> 02:35:41.985]  How dare you?
[02:35:42.005 --> 02:35:50.408]  There's an earlier video they were showing, where there's this big riot cop, and man, he's looking at Josh just like he wants to kill him.
[02:35:50.928 --> 02:35:52.969]  Looking right at the camera, just like...
[02:35:54.264 --> 02:35:55.005]  Like, what do they do?
[02:35:55.085 --> 02:35:58.667]  Show them videos of the press, like, eating children or something?
[02:35:59.728 --> 02:36:01.849]  I mean, how does that cop look at him like that?
[02:36:02.689 --> 02:36:07.633]  I mean, I would just get very upset, like, why are you looking at me like you want to kill me?
[02:36:07.953 --> 02:36:08.893]  What is your problem?
[02:36:09.614 --> 02:36:16.698]  Where I come from in Dallas, I mean, you look at somebody like that on the street, they're gonna just get out of their car and say, what, you got a problem?
[02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:20.621]  I mean, what are you looking at me like you want to kill me for?
[02:36:20.901 --> 02:36:22.202]  What are you pointing a gun at me for?
[02:36:22.422 --> 02:36:23.503]  I haven't done anything to you!
[02:36:26.994 --> 02:36:28.154]  I mean, it's disgusting!
[02:36:29.215 --> 02:36:31.755]  The mentality they put in some of these cops' brains!
[02:36:31.836 --> 02:36:33.596]  It's going to start a civil war.
[02:36:34.977 --> 02:36:38.918]  You mix a bunch of these crazy thugs that are coming in out of St.
[02:36:38.958 --> 02:36:39.898]  Louis and other states.
[02:36:40.938 --> 02:36:41.479]  I'm ranting.
[02:36:41.499 --> 02:36:42.759]  We've got our guest on with us.
[02:36:42.799 --> 02:36:43.599]  We sell the book.
[02:36:44.139 --> 02:36:44.840]  It's excellent.

[02:36:47.861 --> 02:36:49.241]  Police State USA.

[02:37:24.866 --> 02:37:37.489]  Okay, Cheryl, I want to get your take on what's happening in Ferguson right now, and then I want to backtrack it into your book that goes over the history of this and how it's developed.
[02:37:38.208 --> 02:37:52.695]  But quite simply, you've got a lot of military industrial complex interest, a lot of them that are foreign, who want a new market, and they know there's a lot of social problems in America that have been exacerbated, in my view, by the left, who wants dependence.
[02:37:53.356 --> 02:38:01.520]  And so there is a real market to not fix problems, but to actually let them get worse, like FEMA got its funding doubled for disasters after Katrina.
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:05.402]  So we have a government where screwing up gets you a bigger budget,
[02:38:06.493 --> 02:38:08.474]  Well, that's a recipe for disaster, in my view.
[02:38:08.514 --> 02:38:19.537]  We've had sociologists come out and say, no, that's why the political class wants to create crises or exacerbate them, as the former White House Chief of Staff said a few years ago, Rahm Emanuel.
[02:38:19.797 --> 02:38:21.818]  So again, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:38:22.138 --> 02:38:24.379]  Folks can also get the book in bookstores everywhere.
[02:38:24.419 --> 02:38:27.300]  I've seen it in Barnes & Noble or at WND.com.
[02:38:27.700 --> 02:38:28.540]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:29.881]  Hey, Alex.
[02:38:29.941 --> 02:38:31.181]  Thank you so much for having me.
[02:38:31.201 --> 02:38:32.102]  It's great to be here.
[02:38:32.402 --> 02:38:35.883]  Though the circumstances aren't the best with Ferguson in the background.
[02:38:37.333 --> 02:38:39.634]  I mean, give us your take on Ferguson.
[02:38:40.575 --> 02:38:52.161]  You know, it's a moving target right now, but I will say when Ferguson first broke, my initial reaction was to wonder why the police had to roll out the military-grade equipment so quickly.
[02:38:53.061 --> 02:38:58.224]  You know, now you look at the scenes and a lot of people will look at what the police are using in terms of
[02:38:58.804 --> 02:39:03.569]  Uh, what they say they need to justify, uh, to defend their police officers, keep them safe.
[02:39:03.930 --> 02:39:16.062]  And a lot of people might agree with that, but if you go back in time to when the protests first started, it just seems like police went to level 10, uh, on rolling out the equipment where they could have started off maybe at level 2 or 3.
[02:39:18.089 --> 02:39:19.090]  And they're not stupid.
[02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:22.332]  The people giving the orders know full well that was provocative.
[02:39:22.812 --> 02:39:24.554]  The feds have been there since the start.
[02:39:24.994 --> 02:39:35.641]  We have a lot of history of provocateurs, especially with the feds, I guess to, again, create a threat or exacerbate it so they get more funding.
[02:39:37.122 --> 02:39:38.323]  Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[02:39:38.343 --> 02:39:47.430]  You've got a very interesting bio as a journalist, but what got you interested in the police state, and how did you do the research to put together such a powerful, powerful book?
[02:39:48.526 --> 02:39:50.146]  Thank you for the kind words on that.
[02:39:50.166 --> 02:39:51.007]  I appreciate it.
[02:39:51.667 --> 02:40:01.609]  My background is about 15 years now in reporting and journalism and like most reporters, I started out on the local level and I kind of keyed in on constitutional issues.
[02:40:01.669 --> 02:40:14.032]  When I would go to Board of Supervisors meetings and zoning meetings, I would notice how local regulators had great impact on stopping people from building a home, from putting up a shed, from paving a driveway.
[02:40:14.472 --> 02:40:18.797]  And I noticed that all came from the federal government, the EPA and so forth.
[02:40:19.238 --> 02:40:21.760]  And so I just kept track of things through the years.
[02:40:21.861 --> 02:40:25.264]  And when I went to research this book, I didn't have to look hard.
[02:40:25.405 --> 02:40:29.069]  It was more paring down examples of what's going on in terms of
[02:40:29.429 --> 02:40:31.530]  Where should we start breaking down the police state?
[02:40:51.070 --> 02:40:53.411]  Well, Ferguson is definitely the platform.
[02:40:53.772 --> 02:41:02.677]  But I sure do wish we had had this talk back when, you know, the toddler in Atlanta was busy being blown up by SWAT team tactics run amok.
[02:41:03.277 --> 02:41:17.305]  And, you know, that would have been the perfect example of how police should not have military-grade equipment because all it does is entice them to use it for missions and for roles that are better served with a knock on the door.
[02:41:17.845 --> 02:41:33.774]  You know, people are dying in America because police, with military equipment, are taking it on themselves to use that equipment for things that could be better served, just like how police used to do it 20 years ago, with a more protect and serve mentality.
[02:41:34.374 --> 02:41:44.000]  And this is the perfect opportunity, though, with Ferguson bringing it back in the limelight, to look at why police have this equipment in the first place, and what Americans can do to curb its use.
[02:41:48.557 --> 02:41:55.277]  I mean the book, as you said, is just full of examples of the police state, but for folks that haven't read the book or who aren't experts on it...
[02:41:59.249 --> 02:42:01.351]  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
[02:42:01.471 --> 02:42:04.213]  I also cover, you know, that's just one chapter in my book.
[02:42:04.593 --> 02:42:12.240]  If you look at the EPA, what the EPA does on a daily basis, not just at the federal level, but how those trickle down to the local level.
[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:18.645]  If you look at the emerging use of drones, now you have California and Arizona police departments picking that up.
[02:42:19.045 --> 02:42:23.208]  You have the business sector hoping to hop aboard and use drones.
[02:42:23.548 --> 02:42:35.815]  If you look at some of the surveillance activity, I know all your listeners are aware of the latest from Edward Snowden, but they may not be aware of what private businesses are doing to snatch up some of this technology.
[02:42:36.335 --> 02:42:37.896]  Or you can spy on people.
[02:42:38.196 --> 02:42:49.382]  When you walk into a store now, your department store may be pinging off your cell phone to alert the owners that you are a high dollar value shopper and that you've just entered the store.
[02:42:49.963 --> 02:43:03.170]  The mannequins may actually have recording video and audio recording devices in their heads to not watch for theft control, but basically to pick up what shoppers are saying in the stores in order to use for marketing reasons.
[02:43:03.610 --> 02:43:05.471]  I have a chapter on executive orders.
[02:43:05.891 --> 02:43:09.853]  You know, you look at President Obama bragging to the world that he doesn't need Congress.
[02:43:09.893 --> 02:43:11.934]  He has a pen, he has a telephone.
[02:43:12.034 --> 02:43:14.635]  Who needs the law, the Constitution and Congress?
[02:43:15.155 --> 02:43:22.979]  If you look at what's going on in our schools, Michelle Obama, the Queen Nanny, telling parents in America how they should feed their own children.
[02:43:24.059 --> 02:43:24.959]  That's what's important.
[02:43:24.979 --> 02:43:37.803]  That's why I like your book, is because we think of the police state as armored vehicles and LRADs, rubber bullets, cops in space invaders, sci-fi stormtrooper outfits, and certainly that's part of it.
[02:43:38.383 --> 02:43:41.404]  But the police state isn't even really about the cops.
[02:43:42.465 --> 02:43:43.645]  The media has spun it
[02:43:45.188 --> 02:43:47.530]  That you're anti-police if you use the word police state.
[02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:48.951]  No, police state means 1984.
[02:43:49.692 --> 02:43:51.793]  Police state means North Korea.
[02:43:52.094 --> 02:43:53.775]  Police state means Mexico.
[02:43:54.816 --> 02:43:57.198]  Police state means a failed state.
[02:43:57.638 --> 02:44:00.340]  It means a country that's a banana republic.
[02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:03.242]  So why was this premeditatedly being set up?
[02:44:03.963 --> 02:44:08.166]  Not to secure the republic, but to overthrow it and the corrupt political class.
[02:44:08.627 --> 02:44:12.170]  And then you bring in the police state is about arbitrary power.
[02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:16.893]  I mean, until a decade ago, they had to pay you when they took your property.
[02:44:17.313 --> 02:44:19.254]  Market value with eminent domain.
[02:44:19.674 --> 02:44:21.736]  Now they just take it and don't even pay you.
[02:44:22.096 --> 02:44:28.820]  And so that's what your book gets into, is so many areas of the police state that I hadn't even thought to call police state.
[02:44:29.220 --> 02:44:30.441]  I would call agenda 21 tyranny.
[02:44:32.162 --> 02:44:33.023]  But really, you're right.
[02:44:33.544 --> 02:44:35.325]  It is the police state.
[02:44:35.746 --> 02:44:37.628]  It is the end of checks and balances.
[02:44:37.728 --> 02:44:47.037]  It is just arbitrary global rule, UN treaties, that we're not even signatories to, being implemented by the bureaucracies.
[02:44:47.437 --> 02:44:53.924]  It's like Obama is implementing gun control by executive action, and he points to the UN as his authority.
[02:44:55.325 --> 02:44:56.465]  And here's the real danger.
[02:44:56.545 --> 02:44:58.626]  Most of it's being done with a smile.
[02:44:59.006 --> 02:45:01.227]  Most of it's being done with justification.
[02:45:01.947 --> 02:45:05.168]  It's either for the children or it's for the security of the nation.
[02:45:05.528 --> 02:45:18.511]  So the people who are doing these regulatory controls, they're doing it by patting themselves on the back and they're receiving praise from people who think, wow, you care so much about American people that you want to help out.
[02:45:18.611 --> 02:45:20.152]  You want to help with security.
[02:45:20.592 --> 02:45:27.896]  Well, when I hear security nowadays coming from the government, I think regulation and control because that's what so much of this talk is bringing.
[02:45:36.688 --> 02:45:42.613]  Neoconservative, but not in the neocon way, but a new conservative movement that's more constitutionally based.
[02:45:42.653 --> 02:45:44.434]  It's actually a return to the paleoconservatives.
[02:45:44.454 --> 02:45:49.398]  It's come out in the news that there are secret libertarian and conservative, quote, societies in LA.
[02:45:49.739 --> 02:45:51.800]  They're not really secret societies.
[02:45:51.881 --> 02:45:55.524]  It's that you'll lose your job if it comes out you're not basically a communist.
[02:45:56.044 --> 02:46:03.367]  I mean, I've had Hollywood people tell me I had to come out and support Obama, or I wouldn't have gotten this new contract, or I wouldn't have gotten this TV show.
[02:46:03.387 --> 02:46:04.327]  But, gee, I hate him.
[02:46:04.847 --> 02:46:07.088]  But I went and saw The Giver last night.
[02:46:07.629 --> 02:46:12.510]  Anti-abortion, libertarian, anti-drone, anti-collectivist film.
[02:46:12.971 --> 02:46:14.571]  Very well done, Jeff Bridges.
[02:46:15.211 --> 02:46:23.815]  So many of the films I see now, Man of Steel, the list goes on and on, actually have a winter soldier, Captain America,
[02:46:25.302 --> 02:46:27.464]  Absolutely pro-liberty view.
[02:46:28.104 --> 02:46:30.826]  Describes how criminal elements are hijacking the government.
[02:46:31.387 --> 02:46:33.708]  So there's a lot of good signs as well.
[02:46:34.049 --> 02:46:35.970]  Rand Paul has come out against the police state.
[02:46:37.011 --> 02:46:40.633]  We've seen a lot of the so-called left coming out against it.
[02:46:40.894 --> 02:46:46.258]  We've seen a lot of sheriffs and police chiefs saying they don't want to dress like stormtroopers.
[02:46:46.358 --> 02:46:48.900]  So we're seeing some departments
[02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:57.011]  Actually learn about soft power and go back to actually having a good relationship with the public while we see other departments going the other way.
[02:46:57.251 --> 02:47:00.936]  So I see a battle for the heart and soul of this country going on right now.
[02:47:01.673 --> 02:47:06.235]  That's absolutely right, and that's a big reason why I wrote this book also.
[02:47:06.375 --> 02:47:15.300]  I think if people are educated to know all the different areas that we're being attacked, you know, people will be outraged and they'll want to act.
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:27.106]  Because I truly believe that most Americans love their freedom, they're patriotic, they believe that the founding fathers created this nation on the principle that our rights come from God, not government.
[02:47:27.506 --> 02:47:37.669]  That they're, you know, really upset with how the Obama administration is taking control and power away from the people and doing it with such an elitist, arrogant attitude.
[02:47:38.009 --> 02:47:42.030]  And I think people just need to know that, you know, what you were just describing is true.
[02:47:42.090 --> 02:47:43.371]  There's a lot of optimism.
[02:47:43.411 --> 02:47:44.651]  There's a lot of hope still.
[02:47:44.951 --> 02:47:46.252]  And this still is our nation.
[02:47:46.332 --> 02:47:56.955]  It's a nation of buying for the people form of government, which means we get the chance to boot these people from office and we can stand up and, you know, our voices are very powerful.
[02:47:57.395 --> 02:48:00.097]  And if we want our freedoms back, we can certainly take them.
[02:48:02.199 --> 02:48:03.400]  We've got some bad news.
[02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:15.970]  I had Joe Biggs on just about 25 minutes ago and predicted that you would end up having police or the National Guard, especially the National Guard, because these are kids wearing berettas on their side.
[02:48:16.851 --> 02:48:19.413]  Joe says he's never seen people this young in the Guard.
[02:48:20.114 --> 02:48:23.516]  They have literally sent the absolute newest recruits there
[02:48:24.777 --> 02:48:33.084]  With some very unsavory rabble-rousers that are burning buildings down and really stirring things up and attacking our reporters and other people.
[02:48:34.045 --> 02:48:41.711]  And now the police department has tweeted, we'll put it back on screen and I will read this for folks, NBC News.
[02:48:42.212 --> 02:48:45.094]  Officer involved in shooting outside Ferguson.
[02:48:45.855 --> 02:48:48.217]  A police officer was involved in a shooting Tuesday.
[02:48:49.177 --> 02:48:49.577]  In St.
[02:48:49.637 --> 02:49:02.025]  Louis, about three miles from where Michael Brown was shot and killed in the turbulent suburb of Ferguson, police confirmed there was a heavy police presence at the scene and police marked off the intersection with yellow tape.
[02:49:02.625 --> 02:49:02.825]  St.
[02:49:02.865 --> 02:49:10.050]  Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said on Twitter that the suspect had brandished a knife at police.
[02:49:10.570 --> 02:49:11.851]  Further details were unclear.
[02:49:13.107 --> 02:49:14.748]  Here is the Chief of Police's tweet.
[02:49:29.912 --> 02:49:30.712]  Do I know in St.
[02:49:30.773 --> 02:49:32.033]  Louis who deals with the police?
[02:49:32.554 --> 02:49:36.696]  I talked to another lawyer in Kansas City who's formerly lived in St.
[02:49:36.716 --> 02:49:44.080]  Louis that I know and they predicted when I talked to him last weekend that this was far from over and they both said bottom line it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:49:44.521 --> 02:49:58.409]  I'm concerned about this spilling out in the rest of the country and I wish it would have been handled better earlier by releasing the full report, by listening to the community and not being heavy-handed and I wish those thugs
[02:49:59.893 --> 02:50:04.535]  Using Craigslist, hadn't come into town and looted as their excuse to steal.
[02:50:04.575 --> 02:50:09.397]  This is so horrible for the inner city communities and everybody else.
[02:50:11.078 --> 02:50:12.318]  It's just a terrible situation.
[02:50:12.358 --> 02:50:13.639]  What's your gut tell you is going to happen?
[02:50:14.605 --> 02:50:22.833]  Yeah, I think there are some real strong demands that the officer be charged with some type of murder rap.
[02:50:23.153 --> 02:50:27.718]  And if that doesn't happen, I do agree that the violence is going to escalate.
[02:50:27.778 --> 02:50:30.941]  I think that's kind of what everybody's waiting right now to hear on.
[02:50:31.381 --> 02:50:36.967]  As far as the spillover, I believe I've already seen reports that it has kind of seeped out of the streets of Ferguson.
[02:50:36.987 --> 02:50:38.728]  Yeah, LA and New York City.
[02:50:39.631 --> 02:50:42.254]  Yeah, and spilled into neighboring communities and so forth.
[02:50:42.515 --> 02:50:44.817]  And, you know, you name them right, they're thugs.
[02:50:45.138 --> 02:50:51.125]  And, you know, the thugs that come down and invade this community as justification to steal and loot and so forth.
[02:50:51.505 --> 02:50:54.429]  They should be thrown in jail as soon as police can identify them.
[02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:57.453]  The good news is, a lot of their faces are captured on video.
[02:50:59.249 --> 02:51:01.530]  But most of the time, the government doesn't want to track them down.
[02:51:01.571 --> 02:51:06.153]  They're too busy rubber-bulleting reporters who are doing nothing, literally doing nothing.
[02:51:06.173 --> 02:51:09.295]  Our reporters are not antagonizing the police.
[02:51:09.856 --> 02:51:10.256]  Question.
[02:51:10.636 --> 02:51:14.859]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[02:51:15.419 --> 02:51:16.260]  Answer, yes.
[02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:22.364]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Terragonix.

[02:52:38.923 --> 02:52:42.085]  You've been hearing about the in-home freeze dryer from Harvest Ride for months now.
[02:52:42.445 --> 02:52:43.566]  Have you invested in yours yet?
[02:52:43.986 --> 02:52:46.367]  As you know, we live in a politically and economically troubled time.
[02:52:46.567 --> 02:52:49.289]  You should be preparing for an uncertain future today.
[02:52:50.029 --> 02:52:56.054]  Right now is the time to start freeze drying your own food so you can become self-reliant and less dependent upon others.

[02:53:00.357 --> 02:53:01.859]  Hurry, supplies are limited.

[02:53:04.941 --> 02:53:07.143]  And be sure to mention this ad to save $200 through the month of August.
[02:53:08.564 --> 02:53:10.925]  Policies issued by American General Life Insurance Company, Houston, Texas.
[02:53:11.085 --> 02:53:11.866]  Not available in all states.
[02:53:11.966 --> 02:53:13.487]  For details, visit AIGDirect.com.
[02:53:13.927 --> 02:53:17.869]  It takes a lot of courage to face your own death, but I'm glad I finally did.
[02:53:18.429 --> 02:53:22.792]  See, I was putting off getting life insurance to protect my family, even though I knew it was important.
[02:53:23.132 --> 02:53:24.333]  Then my neighbor's husband died.
[02:53:24.773 --> 02:53:27.414]  I watched her struggle emotionally and financially.
[02:53:27.835 --> 02:53:29.295]  It really made me face reality.
[02:53:29.516 --> 02:53:34.298]  If my husband died, how would I pay the mortgage, the car payments, or keep up the life the kids and I had?
[02:53:34.979 --> 02:53:37.220]  I realized I needed to get us life insurance right away.
[02:53:37.620 --> 02:53:38.861]  So I called AIG Direct.
[02:53:39.202 --> 02:53:40.963]  In less than five minutes, I had a quote.

[02:53:47.629 --> 02:53:50.572]  I feel so much better knowing my family has protection.

[02:53:58.410 --> 02:53:58.470]  1-800-463-7479.
[02:54:24.901 --> 02:54:28.444]  We'll have continual coverage about what's happening in world news in the Middle East.
[02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:32.347]  So much more tonight on the Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:54:34.669 --> 02:54:39.253]  But Ferguson is a microcosm of the rest of the world and our country.
[02:54:39.714 --> 02:54:44.598]  This march towards a high-tech Orwellian grid is happening everywhere.
[02:54:46.144 --> 02:54:55.815]  And police states never bring security that's always done because the establishment has decided to go the route of tyranny, not prosperity.
[02:55:00.421 --> 02:55:05.466]  And all of the things that are being deployed against the population here,
[02:55:07.290 --> 02:55:12.472]  We'll end up being used against veterans, gun owners, and people that don't have criminal records.
[02:55:12.972 --> 02:55:16.934]  Because we are the plums of the establishment.
[02:55:17.174 --> 02:55:19.395]  They want to milk us down to nothing.
[02:55:21.216 --> 02:55:23.597]  The book is available at infowarestore.com.
[02:55:24.317 --> 02:55:28.959]  Cheryl Chumley, Police State USA, How Orwell's Nightmare is Becoming a Reality.
[02:55:30.100 --> 02:55:34.662]  And even if you already know about most of this,
[02:55:35.737 --> 02:55:39.160]  It's important to give this to your police chief, to your county commissioner.
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:40.341]  We can turn the tide.
[02:55:40.361 --> 02:55:43.284]  There's a major movement of police chiefs and sheriffs and others.
[02:55:43.304 --> 02:55:43.884]  Look at Detroit.
[02:55:45.666 --> 02:55:48.428]  When they have an officer involved shooting, they just release the information.
[02:55:51.330 --> 02:55:56.675]  The police chief tells the citizens, go out, get guns, defend yourself from thugs, and the community works together.
[02:55:58.537 --> 02:56:01.119]  And now their crime rate has gone sky high, starting to go down.
[02:56:03.157 --> 02:56:06.798]  So that's the answer, is not an us against them mentality.
[02:56:07.438 --> 02:56:10.759]  Sometimes you gotta hit rock bottom before that happens.
[02:56:10.799 --> 02:56:17.801]  We'll do a little bit of overdrive and take your calls for Bella, who's been holding like a trooper, and Chris and others.
[02:56:19.781 --> 02:56:23.122]  But again, the book is available at infowarestore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:56:23.142 --> 02:56:23.902]  Another shooting
[02:56:29.309 --> 02:56:52.680]  In Ferguson, just in the last 30 minutes, our reporters are about to be on the scene, and I will go into overdrive while I take your calls to see if they can get in place and give us a report on what's happening, but you were finishing up by saying there is an idea here that somebody
[02:56:54.281 --> 02:56:55.202]  He's in trouble.
[02:57:10.798 --> 02:57:12.979]  Um, there are a lot of witnesses coming out.
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:18.563]  I don't think we know the truth because police have been caught lying so much they've lost the moral high ground in many cases.
[02:57:19.263 --> 02:57:22.565]  But I think it's leaning towards the officer's story right now.
[02:57:23.245 --> 02:57:26.387]  And so you can't just indict him to stop rioting.
[02:57:27.668 --> 02:57:30.029]  I mean, I don't think there's any moral dilemma here.
[02:57:30.149 --> 02:57:38.114]  But at the same time, with a lot of these crowds, it seems like there's agitators in there that just want to stir things up.
[02:57:38.454 --> 02:57:39.515]  Where do you think this is going?
[02:57:40.228 --> 02:57:53.499]  Well, let's not forget that Eric Holder has sent, you know, plenty of agents on the scene from six different departments within the Justice Department to root out how police may have crossed lines.
[02:57:53.939 --> 02:58:05.969]  And he made that rather inflammatory statement from Martha's Vineyard where he talked about how police, if they had a more diverse police department, it would inspire more trust in the community of Ferguson.
[02:58:06.449 --> 02:58:27.880]  So, if you look at the Justice Department's statements, it seems a little bit alarming that when they're the ones in control of performing the third autopsy, and when they're taking such a heavy-handed presence on Ferguson soil, which is unprecedented for a federal agency, it raises some red flags about whether this is going to be a tainted end result for the police officer.
[02:58:29.893 --> 02:58:35.297]  Meanwhile, DrugsReport.com has our article out showing the CNN clip of somebody holding up an ISIS sign.
[02:58:35.677 --> 02:58:44.864]  There are a lot of people that think ISIS is really cool, mainly in the black Muslim community in this country, and that's scary as well, that our borders are wide open.
[02:58:45.264 --> 02:58:45.704]  Amazing.
[02:58:45.764 --> 02:58:47.245]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:58:47.926 --> 02:58:49.607]  Cheryl Chomley, great new book.
[02:58:49.927 --> 02:58:52.409]  Police State USA, great to wake people up.
[02:58:52.809 --> 02:58:53.870]  Pretty darn scary.

[02:59:29.412 --> 02:59:32.935]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:59:33.075 --> 02:59:37.037]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:59:37.358 --> 02:59:38.819]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:59:39.139 --> 02:59:44.162]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:19.722]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:20.402 --> 03:00:21.202]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.982 --> 03:00:22.903]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:23.523 --> 03:00:27.164]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:27.725 --> 03:00:31.806]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.026 --> 03:00:33.647]  All right, Bella.
[03:00:33.667 --> 03:00:35.147]  Thank you for holding so long.
[03:00:35.187 --> 03:00:36.388]  We had multiple guests on.
[03:00:36.408 --> 03:00:38.809]  I wanted to get you on air, so here we are.
[03:00:39.229 --> 03:00:43.771]  Bella, in Missouri, what is your take on the situation in Ferguson?
[03:00:43.791 --> 03:00:44.831]  I know that's what you called in about.
[03:00:45.885 --> 03:00:46.245]  It is.
[03:00:46.686 --> 03:00:47.026]  It is.
[03:00:47.226 --> 03:00:48.707]  I lived in Florissant.
[03:00:49.268 --> 03:00:51.410]  Drove West Florissant many times.
[03:00:53.591 --> 03:00:55.473]  Missouri is known for its hospitality.
[03:00:56.253 --> 03:01:00.497]  And I'd like to apologize for the whole state for what's going on.
[03:01:00.517 --> 03:01:02.178]  Oh, come on.
[03:01:02.238 --> 03:01:03.920]  It's not your fault or the state's fault.
[03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:05.621]  This is the climate in America.
[03:01:05.641 --> 03:01:06.502]  This is what's happened.
[03:01:07.502 --> 03:01:11.045]  I came from a very respected political family.
[03:01:11.706 --> 03:01:14.428]  However, it was a yellow dog Democrat family.
[03:01:15.467 --> 03:01:20.650]  But you and InfoWars helped educate me to see, and now I'm a Tea Party.
[03:01:21.270 --> 03:01:21.651]  That's awesome.
[03:01:22.911 --> 03:01:26.553]  Well, my gosh, you know, I can't believe what's going on.
[03:01:26.593 --> 03:01:32.057]  I used to campaign for Senator Jerry Linton when I was 13.
[03:01:32.397 --> 03:01:34.318]  Governor McCarney was my mentor.
[03:01:35.359 --> 03:01:36.339]  So this is personal.
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:39.501]  And God bless you.
[03:01:39.941 --> 03:01:42.863]  But I do want to tell you something that is important.
[03:01:43.453 --> 03:01:49.616]  I know a lot of people think that the supernatural is just absolutely nuts, but whatever.
[03:01:49.636 --> 03:01:54.438]  I am going to say, my bloodline goes back to 36 A.D.
[03:01:54.938 --> 03:01:55.458]  in Ireland.
[03:01:55.498 --> 03:01:58.020]  I was Irish royalty, or my relatives were.
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:00.841]  So I do have the sight.
[03:02:01.601 --> 03:02:09.085]  And so I cannot tell you how relieved I was to hear you were not going to be there in Ferguson.
[03:02:09.105 --> 03:02:12.086]  So you're saying your gut thinks something would have happened to me if I went?
[03:02:13.943 --> 03:02:16.044]  Alex, I'm going to say, what do you think?
[03:02:17.385 --> 03:02:23.129]  Well, you know, I know I knock on wood and stuff like that, but I trust in God's providence, so if it's time for me to go, it's time for me to go.
[03:02:23.749 --> 03:02:25.931]  Quite frankly, it sounds like a vacation to go.
[03:02:25.991 --> 03:02:30.774]  It'd kind of be interesting, and I would love to be able to go ask the questions I wanted to ask and get stuff done.
[03:02:30.794 --> 03:02:32.315]  I was talking about going last week.
[03:02:32.915 --> 03:02:34.736]  It's just I have so much to do here.
[03:02:35.877 --> 03:02:38.839]  Running this whole operation, that's why I hired reporters.
[03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:47.946]  And I've gone out and been in stuff like this in New York, when the police were arresting thousands, and I've been arrested in demonstrations in New York, Austin, you name it.
[03:02:47.986 --> 03:02:49.488]  So I'm not afraid to go to this.
[03:02:50.128 --> 03:02:51.729]  I've been at the DNC, you name it.
[03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:57.774]  As some of the trolls have said, I almost pulled my reporters completely out, and they all wanted to go back.
[03:02:58.715 --> 03:03:00.096]  And so I said, okay.
[03:03:00.116 --> 03:03:02.498]  I mean, it's just such a mess.
[03:03:03.985 --> 03:03:12.409]  Well, Alex, you had two callers mention the problem with the Federal Reserve, and we shouldn't wait for our politicians to do something about it.
[03:03:22.356 --> 03:03:42.290]  We should, as Max Keiser was saying on your June 6, 2013 show, resort to our only sanctuary, alternatives to commerce, like the Bristol Pound that he mentioned, which is the most ideal community currency of which I know in existence, that's in Bristol, UK, and it can also be used to pay local business taxes.
[03:03:42.350 --> 03:03:44.131]  The mayor of Bristol is accepting one.
[03:03:44.151 --> 03:03:47.194]  Isn't there an island off England, too, called Guernsey or something?
[03:03:47.214 --> 03:03:48.935]  Were they for hundreds of years by their own currency?
[03:03:49.622 --> 03:03:51.904]  Yes, the Guernsey experiment, that's worked out well.
[03:03:52.685 --> 03:03:58.391]  Yeah, I mean this stuff really works out well, and really that is the ultimate revolution, is economic.
[03:03:58.791 --> 03:04:01.854]  That's why they want to ban lemonade stands in farmers markets.
[03:04:02.691 --> 03:04:04.212]  The big corporations know what they're doing.
[03:04:04.252 --> 03:04:07.014]  They don't want us doing local commerce.
[03:04:07.034 --> 03:04:10.056]  They don't want us supporting local media or independent media.
[03:04:10.436 --> 03:04:15.119]  Literally, our lifestyles, where we live, the neighborhoods we build.
[03:04:15.740 --> 03:04:18.201]  I mean, listen, gay people took over the rainbow.
[03:04:18.241 --> 03:04:20.643]  It used to belong to Lucky Charms and, you know,
[03:04:22.404 --> 03:04:24.064]  Leprechauns and, you know, magic.
[03:04:24.605 --> 03:04:27.685]  And, you know, they took that over, have their own neighborhoods, all that stuff.
[03:04:28.085 --> 03:04:34.987]  Why can't liberty lovers build their own culture, their own society, by pretty much exclusively supporting each other?
[03:04:35.487 --> 03:04:37.528]  And I think that's a model of victory.
[03:04:37.828 --> 03:04:38.368]  And you're right.
[03:04:38.428 --> 03:04:42.009]  Community currencies, cryptocurrencies, stay there.
[03:04:42.029 --> 03:04:43.549]  I'm going to come back to you to talk about solutions.
[03:04:43.989 --> 03:04:46.290]  Because I don't want to just sit here and complain about all this.
[03:04:47.010 --> 03:04:49.710]  We've got a lot of police chiefs and sheriffs waking up.
[03:04:49.730 --> 03:04:51.551]  We've got a lot of police waking up.
[03:04:52.659 --> 03:04:57.383]  Ten years ago, I would just bash the police because I was mad how they were being unconstitutional.
[03:04:57.924 --> 03:05:02.928]  Then I realized how they're being manipulated, how the funding, how they're recruited for good reasons, then twisted.
[03:05:02.948 --> 03:05:06.371]  You know, Serpico's talked about that on the show, so we're going to discuss it.
[03:05:06.391 --> 03:05:07.052]  Stay there, Chris.
[03:05:10.106 --> 03:05:11.347]  Another major health threat.
[03:05:11.387 --> 03:05:16.249]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:05:16.329 --> 03:05:18.970]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:05:19.010 --> 03:05:25.812]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:05:26.053 --> 03:05:28.934]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:05:29.054 --> 03:05:31.955]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:05:31.975 --> 03:05:33.996]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:05:34.016 --> 03:05:36.877]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:05:36.937 --> 03:05:42.459]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[03:05:42.679 --> 03:05:46.161]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[03:05:46.181 --> 03:05:49.162]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[03:06:09.691 --> 03:06:12.412]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:06:12.652 --> 03:06:16.614]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[03:06:16.794 --> 03:06:18.876]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:06:19.076 --> 03:06:24.098]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:06:24.238 --> 03:06:25.979]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[03:06:26.059 --> 03:06:27.360]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:06:27.600 --> 03:06:29.041]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[03:06:29.081 --> 03:06:32.163]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:06:32.443 --> 03:06:37.486]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:06:37.827 --> 03:06:46.952]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[03:06:49.514 --> 03:06:50.895]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[03:06:55.638 --> 03:06:58.840]  The human body is extraordinary, despite all the stresses we inflict upon it.
[03:07:13.610 --> 03:07:15.251]  It still works hard to stay in balance.
[03:07:15.451 --> 03:07:20.474]  Thousands upon thousands of people rely upon hardened body extract to help their body stay balanced.

[03:08:12.320 --> 03:08:18.383]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:18.984 --> 03:08:22.025]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:24.407 --> 03:08:28.329]  Our reporters are very close to another police shooting.
[03:08:33.103 --> 03:08:40.786]  And we don't know the details because the police are obviously in control of the whole situation and have circled the wagons in Ferguson.
[03:08:41.566 --> 03:08:49.049]  And you can just feel, I mean I said this a month ago on air, the next big shoot-or-drop would be a race riot and provocateuring.
[03:08:49.069 --> 03:08:56.172]  You can see the White House, see MSNBC, see CNN, hear all the hype, the Ford Foundation, the open borders.
[03:08:57.012 --> 03:08:59.113]  There's a live Fox helicopter, St.
[03:08:59.133 --> 03:09:02.314]  Louis City Police shoot-kill, knife-wielding suspect.
[03:09:04.969 --> 03:09:10.233]  And as much burning and looting as I've seen, it's very possible somebody was dumb enough to wield a knife at cops.
[03:09:11.914 --> 03:09:14.135]  And come nighttime, I think things are gonna explode.
[03:09:16.497 --> 03:09:18.158]  I don't know, I might have to go up there.
[03:09:20.920 --> 03:09:24.463]  Just to see this for myself, and to try to stop it if I can.
[03:09:24.863 --> 03:09:26.304]  People say, oh, how are you gonna stop it?
[03:09:26.344 --> 03:09:30.167]  Well, if we all sit back and think we can't stop it, then we won't stop it.
[03:09:33.249 --> 03:09:33.429]  But,
[03:09:34.773 --> 03:09:36.955]  They've primed a race war in this country.
[03:09:37.195 --> 03:09:38.756]  They got the borders wide open.
[03:09:39.376 --> 03:09:42.599]  They've got the cops all in a militarized blockhead mode.
[03:09:42.619 --> 03:09:49.044]  You got a bunch of knockout game trash coming into the area to have fun.
[03:09:49.824 --> 03:09:52.186]  The cops won't go after them when they're burning stuff down.
[03:09:53.087 --> 03:09:56.489]  Instead, they're going to be gunning down, whacked out of their mind, angry people.
[03:09:59.431 --> 03:10:01.253]  And you know there's a lot of guns in that community.
[03:10:02.013 --> 03:10:03.915]  The police have reportedly already been shot at.
[03:10:05.967 --> 03:10:06.888]  Who knows if that's true.
[03:10:06.908 --> 03:10:07.689]  It's probably true.
[03:10:07.709 --> 03:10:10.053]  That usually happens in these riots.
[03:10:10.914 --> 03:10:13.938]  What doesn't ever happen is cops attacking the media.
[03:10:13.978 --> 03:10:16.341]  This is unbelievable.
[03:10:18.885 --> 03:10:21.068]  And it just shows how this country is so screwed up.
[03:10:22.563 --> 03:10:36.651]  I've seen riots in Brazil, riots in Nigeria, the film footage, over the decades and recently, and the horses will ride right by and run over people, or they'll shoot rubber bullets at a crowd, and they don't mess with the reporters.
[03:10:41.954 --> 03:10:43.775]  A, because you don't want to turn the media against you.
[03:10:45.877 --> 03:10:48.618]  B, you can't ever stop the reporters from getting the info out.
[03:10:48.638 --> 03:10:49.919]  It makes them want to show up even more.
[03:10:51.454 --> 03:10:53.675]  I found people really aren't even cowards on average.
[03:10:53.715 --> 03:10:54.296]  They're lazy.
[03:10:55.136 --> 03:10:59.858]  And when you make something personal with people, that's why Biggs and all them want to stay and don't want to leave.
[03:11:00.079 --> 03:11:01.079]  They're not going to be run off.
[03:11:03.420 --> 03:11:07.623]  In fact, I predict, even though I've told him not to do it, that Biggs is going to really pull some stuff tonight.
[03:11:08.423 --> 03:11:17.368]  Not bad stuff, but I mean, he is going to be crawling around on the ground in the bushes and, you know, in the drainage pipes, you know, in the manholes.
[03:11:17.448 --> 03:11:18.728]  I mean, just the whole nine yards.
[03:11:23.268 --> 03:11:25.030]  Civil War will be like a big game.
[03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:27.273]  It'll be a big, exciting war.
[03:11:28.154 --> 03:11:29.635]  And men like to fight and kill.
[03:11:29.695 --> 03:11:31.377]  I mean, let's just get down to it at the end of the day.
[03:11:32.238 --> 03:11:33.860]  And that's what we're designed to know how to do.
[03:11:34.040 --> 03:11:35.222]  And it just becomes a big game.
[03:11:35.542 --> 03:11:36.863]  The cops are going to have fun.
[03:11:36.963 --> 03:11:37.865]  We're going to have fun.
[03:11:37.885 --> 03:11:40.027]  I mean, I'm not going to have fun.
[03:11:40.227 --> 03:11:41.749]  I'm saying the Liberty Movement.
[03:11:44.858 --> 03:11:46.340]  I mean, isn't this what the cops signed up for?
[03:11:46.360 --> 03:11:47.381]  You signed up for a war?
[03:11:47.942 --> 03:11:48.702]  You want one?
[03:11:48.722 --> 03:11:51.085]  The globalists are gonna give you one!
[03:11:51.105 --> 03:11:54.229]  A big, nice civil war in America.
[03:11:55.150 --> 03:11:55.850]  Disgusting!
[03:11:56.892 --> 03:11:58.273]  And that's why I'm so upset today.
[03:11:58.373 --> 03:11:59.795]  I can feel the doom.
[03:11:59.815 --> 03:12:01.357]  I can feel it.
[03:12:01.517 --> 03:12:02.418]  It's not depression.
[03:12:02.498 --> 03:12:03.259]  I don't get depressed.
[03:12:06.502 --> 03:12:10.025]  It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion that's pointless and wrecks things.
[03:12:10.825 --> 03:12:13.687]  And I care about the protesters.
[03:12:14.528 --> 03:12:21.013]  I can't stand the manipulated looters, the cops.
[03:12:24.876 --> 03:12:30.080]  Day one, you know, two days into this, when I'm going to your calls, when the police
[03:12:31.724 --> 03:12:31.864]  It's
[03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:55.273]  An investigation until we see that they, you know, do an investigation.
[03:12:55.673 --> 03:12:58.515]  And if it's a bad investigation, then they're covering it up and they're wrong.
[03:12:59.095 --> 03:13:00.776]  But riots aren't going to help anything.
[03:13:01.777 --> 03:13:03.177]  That'll only help the power structure.
[03:13:03.237 --> 03:13:06.359]  So let's let's support what the police are doing so far.
[03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:10.262]  Then they act like total crazy third world.
[03:13:10.742 --> 03:13:12.503]  I mean, the third world cops don't act like this.
[03:13:12.543 --> 03:13:13.744]  This is mental illness.
[03:13:15.469 --> 03:13:22.151]  Pointing guns at Josh Owens, arresting Washington Post reporters, on power trips, in military outfits.
[03:13:22.991 --> 03:13:25.092]  I mean, it's just part of the mental illness in this country.
[03:13:25.472 --> 03:13:27.252]  A bunch of fake macho twits.
[03:13:28.793 --> 03:13:33.034]  And the minute you did that, then it gave the thugs the moral high ground.
[03:13:33.514 --> 03:13:36.415]  They were able to come in and displace the reasonable demonstrators.
[03:13:36.815 --> 03:13:42.317]  And this thing was set up for the makings of riots all over the country the minute that happened.
[03:13:44.659 --> 03:13:49.264]  And now the Feds are there, they've been there for at least a week, and you notice stuff's getting a lot worse.
[03:13:50.305 --> 03:13:52.468]  It is the Feds directing all of this.
[03:13:53.008 --> 03:13:59.596]  They've been directing it, they're undoubtedly directing the new Black Panther Party, who's been caught working for the Feds before.
[03:14:00.156 --> 03:14:01.998]  It is a recipe for disaster.
[03:14:02.339 --> 03:14:03.941]  Chris, go ahead and make your point from Florida.
[03:14:05.556 --> 03:14:13.460]  Continuing, I don't currently know of any example where the establishment is attacking community currencies or other alternative forms of commerce to the Fed.
[03:14:14.120 --> 03:14:27.687]  Because it's not pretending to be currency, it's time-denominated, and it's protected by the same laws that prohibit counterfeiting of, say, tickets for movies, concerts, and sporting events, or coupons, gift certificates, or other negotiable instruments.
[03:14:28.227 --> 03:14:49.594]  And so if we can allow, once a community currency is popular enough, we can go to our city councils, county commissions, and ask them, well, since you're always crying poor, you're raising our rates on utilities, etc., you know, charging fees to go into public lands, well, how about you allow your public employees to opt in to be paid a certain percentage, as they have in Bristol?
[03:14:50.114 --> 03:14:51.215]  We're good to go.
[03:15:15.747 --> 03:15:16.328]  We're good to go.
[03:15:23.292 --> 03:15:36.484]  And so if we can promote these alternatives to the Federal Reserve note, then we can earn ourselves more time to speak with others, to agree with others, which means cooperating and becoming more civically involved.
[03:15:37.685 --> 03:15:45.553]  Then we can have more time to learn the intricacies of the politics, law, history, health, technology, and the police state of the New World Order.
[03:15:46.133 --> 03:15:46.574]  We can earn
[03:15:47.154 --> 03:15:48.014]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:15:48.034 --> 03:15:49.435]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[03:15:49.455 --> 03:15:50.895]  I just have two quick questions.
[03:15:50.915 --> 03:15:55.617]  How far do you think this police state has to go for people to finally wake up to the reality of what's taking place?
[03:15:55.637 --> 03:16:00.019]  And do you think they will stage a terror attack to further escalate their martial law agenda?
[03:16:16.963 --> 03:16:18.124]  Thanks and keep up the good work.
[03:16:18.364 --> 03:16:19.025]  Thank you, sir.
[03:16:19.545 --> 03:16:24.409]  Yeah, first they roll out Homeland Security for radical Muslims while they actually are funding them and protecting them.
[03:16:25.090 --> 03:16:26.351]  That's now all admitted, public.
[03:16:27.552 --> 03:16:29.974]  So I've gotten a lot of apologies from talk show hosts and other people.
[03:16:31.595 --> 03:16:34.337]  And I'm not tooting my horn, I'm just saying I've gotten a lot of apologies.
[03:16:35.018 --> 03:16:36.059]  Public apologies.
[03:16:36.559 --> 03:16:37.560]  From talk show hosts.
[03:16:38.521 --> 03:16:40.722]  Saying, yeah, no, it's all true, our government runs ISIS.
[03:16:41.523 --> 03:16:42.264]  Runs Al-Qaeda.
[03:16:42.484 --> 03:16:43.505]  But again, it's not ISIS.
[03:16:44.699 --> 03:16:46.580]  It's, again, really Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[03:16:47.680 --> 03:16:48.781]  It's not our government either.
[03:16:48.861 --> 03:16:50.241]  It's criminal elements running it.
[03:16:52.722 --> 03:16:54.683]  And so, they want a beta test.
[03:16:54.723 --> 03:16:56.943]  The cops aren't involved in the state's terror attack.
[03:16:57.304 --> 03:16:59.244]  The average military are compartmentalized.
[03:16:59.905 --> 03:17:04.246]  So they have to sell them on the total occupation of the country.
[03:17:05.086 --> 03:17:07.427]  So, oh, you're going to occupy America to fight Al-Qaeda.
[03:17:07.707 --> 03:17:09.208]  You're going to occupy America to fight
[03:17:10.379 --> 03:17:12.860]  A bunch of street thugs that are running around burning down buildings.
[03:17:13.420 --> 03:17:19.503]  But then all the real training behind the scenes is for an authoritarian takeover and the looting of the nation.
[03:17:20.884 --> 03:17:21.584]  By the globalists.
[03:17:23.365 --> 03:17:27.967]  And so, down the road, they're going to have huge terror attacks.
[03:17:28.787 --> 03:17:30.188]  Federal buildings blown up.
[03:17:31.208 --> 03:17:32.289]  Schools attacked.
[03:17:32.969 --> 03:17:34.730]  It'll be dead toddlers on the news.
[03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:37.471]  And oh my gosh, the patriots did it.
[03:17:38.901 --> 03:17:42.344]  Every major shoot-em-up video game that's coming out that's based in the US.
[03:17:43.285 --> 03:17:46.007]  All the big movies, I mean large portions of them.
[03:17:46.588 --> 03:17:48.329]  Tons of the sitcoms, the majority.
[03:17:48.669 --> 03:17:49.490]  Everybody sees this.
[03:17:49.550 --> 03:17:50.451]  I get the calls all the time.
[03:17:50.471 --> 03:17:51.632]  It's new stuff every week.
[03:17:52.112 --> 03:17:53.974]  Where the Patriots are the bad guys.
[03:17:54.034 --> 03:17:57.757]  Green Lantern Cartoon has bad guys that wear tri-quartered hats.
[03:17:59.578 --> 03:18:02.561]  And call themselves, you know, the George Washington supporters.
[03:18:02.941 --> 03:18:03.682]  The Paul Reveres.
[03:18:04.992 --> 03:18:15.661]  So, everybody's subconsciously and consciously programmed that when the criminal element wants to take out the opposition to their takeover, well, what do you do?
[03:18:15.721 --> 03:18:17.443]  You stage a terror attack and you blame it on them.
[03:18:17.883 --> 03:18:19.204]  How did Hitler attack Poland?
[03:18:19.745 --> 03:18:22.427]  He attacked three of his own military bases in Operation Himmler.
[03:18:22.947 --> 03:18:24.128]  Glywood's was the best known.
[03:18:25.870 --> 03:18:27.211]  How do they try to attack Russia?
[03:18:27.271 --> 03:18:32.796]  They have Ukraine shoot down the jet airliner, most of the evidence points that way now, and then blame it on the Russians.
[03:18:33.712 --> 03:18:35.233]  And I'm not romanticizing the Russians.
[03:18:35.513 --> 03:18:37.613]  The point is, the globalists are the ones starting it.
[03:18:40.214 --> 03:18:42.655]  And so, absolutely, is that caller still there?
[03:18:42.675 --> 03:18:44.776]  Because I was going to let him finish up.
[03:18:44.816 --> 03:18:47.777]  But, yeah, it is a false flag.
[03:18:50.958 --> 03:18:51.979]  It is a false flag.
[03:18:54.040 --> 03:18:55.040]  That is what I see.
[03:18:55.440 --> 03:19:02.423]  And it's not like I see a narrative and know what they might do, and so I see everything happening as shadows of that.
[03:19:02.443 --> 03:19:02.783]  No, no, no.
[03:19:04.099 --> 03:19:05.520]  We know their whole program.
[03:19:07.241 --> 03:19:21.527]  With human intelligence, I can go to the drills and then talk to my sources who tell me they're training to shoot Americans en masse, and now they publicly admit it in the Associated Press and at army.mil.
[03:19:24.749 --> 03:19:26.750]  And yeah, am I eccentric?
[03:19:28.311 --> 03:19:29.471]  Do I come off as weird?
[03:19:29.771 --> 03:19:30.572]  Yeah, I am weird.
[03:19:31.781 --> 03:19:34.367]  I guess I am weird that I've cared about this for 20 years.
[03:19:34.768 --> 03:19:38.617]  I guess I am weird that I saw it over the horizon before it got here.
[03:19:39.238 --> 03:19:40.080]  But now it's here!
[03:19:42.543 --> 03:19:55.111]  And I guess in a land of lunatics and a land of lazy people that don't care, in a world of disempowered jellyfish spectators, I guess I am weird that I built a media operation to try to fight this.
[03:19:55.391 --> 03:20:02.716]  I guess I am upset that I found out that they're engineering us through the vaccines and the food towards a horrible end.
[03:20:06.038 --> 03:20:08.679]  And secret experimentation that's been declassified.
[03:20:08.719 --> 03:20:11.381]  I mean, oh my God.
[03:20:14.397 --> 03:20:16.639]  You understand, folks, this is real, okay?
[03:20:19.040 --> 03:20:23.503]  And I think it's just really hitting me today, really hitting me hard how real it is.
[03:20:23.544 --> 03:20:25.305]  I mean, this is really all real.
[03:20:25.405 --> 03:20:26.386]  This is true.
[03:20:26.826 --> 03:20:27.727]  We've been right.
[03:20:28.107 --> 03:20:29.348]  And that is not a good feeling.
[03:20:31.609 --> 03:20:33.351]  It just gets worse and worse and worse.
[03:20:33.451 --> 03:20:35.112]  And I mean, Schultz,
[03:20:36.536 --> 03:20:38.437]  I haven't covered this in two and a half hours of being on air.
[03:20:39.077 --> 03:20:42.098]  Two hours... I can't even... I'm just... I'm tired now.
[03:20:42.678 --> 03:20:44.159]  Three plus hours of being on air.
[03:20:44.199 --> 03:20:45.699]  Three hours, twenty minutes of being on air.
[03:20:48.200 --> 03:20:48.880]  Ed Schultz.
[03:20:49.800 --> 03:20:51.581]  Hate-filled political operative.
[03:20:53.902 --> 03:20:55.342]  I can read him like a book.
[03:20:55.402 --> 03:20:57.443]  I know exactly what gets said at his dinner table.
[03:20:57.463 --> 03:20:58.383]  Everything that goes on with him.
[03:20:59.664 --> 03:21:00.164]  Oh, man.
[03:21:00.484 --> 03:21:00.764]  I just...
[03:21:02.296 --> 03:21:06.759]  Up there saying that domestic groups, that this is for basically the Tea Party.
[03:21:07.879 --> 03:21:12.582]  MSNBC hosts, maybe cops need military gear to deal with anti-government groups.
[03:21:12.622 --> 03:21:18.426]  And when they say that on MSNBC, they mean anybody who believes that we shouldn't be Ed Schultz's slave.
[03:21:19.650 --> 03:21:22.953]  I mean, I'm so sick of these rich, entitled globalists.
[03:21:23.734 --> 03:21:39.089]  Most of them don't even pay taxes, above the law, do whatever they want, and they're building up this treason force to smash the patriot movement, and I'm just waiting for them to stage their false flags and blame it on me.
[03:21:39.610 --> 03:21:42.413]  I mean, MSNBC has already done this over and over again.
[03:21:43.075 --> 03:21:44.575]  I'm behind every police shooting.
[03:21:45.116 --> 03:21:47.676]  I'm calling for killing the cops when I'm calling for the opposite.
[03:21:49.697 --> 03:21:51.297]  I'm behind the Boston bombing.
[03:21:51.497 --> 03:21:52.697]  I'm deeply racist.
[03:21:53.078 --> 03:21:57.379]  I mean, folks, can you imagine what it's like to be on the receiving end?
[03:21:57.399 --> 03:21:59.559]  I mean, I'll be quite frank with you.
[03:22:00.499 --> 03:22:02.000]  I don't want any violence against the police.
[03:22:03.607 --> 03:22:09.892]  I would love, and the only way I can legally say this is to challenge him to a charity boxing match, bare knuckles, I'd love to get in the ring with Schultz.
[03:22:10.192 --> 03:22:11.233]  He thinks he's so tough.
[03:22:11.554 --> 03:22:12.675]  Bill O'Reilly, same thing.
[03:22:12.755 --> 03:22:16.858]  I am so sick of all these fake tough guys sitting there manipulating their audience.
[03:22:16.878 --> 03:22:26.126]  I mean, I couldn't imagine sitting up here knowing psychology and lying to people and twisting and demonizing good people and engaging in fraud.
[03:22:26.146 --> 03:22:27.407]  It makes me want to throw up.
[03:22:28.271 --> 03:22:34.973]  I mean, every time I see Ed Schultz on the screen when it scrolls through InfoWars, I want to turn this table over.
[03:22:35.654 --> 03:22:37.234]  I mean, I'm going to be honest with you.
[03:22:38.475 --> 03:22:39.915]  He makes me want to throw up.
[03:22:39.955 --> 03:22:41.015]  He is disgusting.
[03:22:41.596 --> 03:22:45.037]  I don't even have words to describe what a piece of trash he is.
[03:22:48.878 --> 03:22:50.139]  Big, fat bully.
[03:22:52.960 --> 03:22:56.941]  Big, fat... I guarantee he smells like you know what.
[03:22:57.998 --> 03:23:00.300]  When I look at him, I don't know how to describe it.
[03:23:00.641 --> 03:23:02.583]  He is a pile of you-know-what.
[03:23:04.725 --> 03:23:06.587]  See, I shouldn't even be doing radio on this man.
[03:23:06.627 --> 03:23:07.748]  I think I'm gonna take off tomorrow.
[03:23:08.509 --> 03:23:10.471]  I don't think I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna have David Knight come in here.
[03:23:11.715 --> 03:23:13.836]  Because I just, I mean, this is not an act, folks.
[03:23:13.876 --> 03:23:18.719]  And then I get up here and it's like I'm trapped on air, and there's all this stuff to cover, and I don't want to talk about myself.
[03:23:19.339 --> 03:23:22.561]  I just cannot imagine how people put up with any of this.
[03:23:23.181 --> 03:23:27.323]  The enemy of this country is people like Rachel Maddow and Ed Schultz.
[03:23:27.583 --> 03:23:36.028]  The enemy is people like Obama and the social engineers that know everything I know and more, but they decide to screw over humanity.
[03:23:38.956 --> 03:23:41.378]  They know Obamacare's got death panels in it.
[03:23:42.078 --> 03:23:50.904]  They know that they got our military on death panels and do not treat, do not give care to veterans with skin cancer and stuff.
[03:23:54.346 --> 03:23:55.586]  These people are predators!
[03:23:58.088 --> 03:24:07.354]  And the police and military will not wake up to that, and will not get angry about that, and will not recognize that the Patriot Movement's about to be set up by these sacks of crap!
[03:24:08.783 --> 03:24:10.665]  Then you all deserve what's gonna happen!
[03:24:16.049 --> 03:24:18.351]  They are gonna stage a civil war in this country.
[03:24:18.391 --> 03:24:20.613]  They are going to blow stuff up.
[03:24:20.773 --> 03:24:21.774]  Do you understand that?
[03:24:21.954 --> 03:24:23.375]  It's sure as the sun comes up.
[03:24:23.675 --> 03:24:25.237]  That's probably the next shoe to drop.
[03:24:27.318 --> 03:24:31.722]  And the only reason they haven't done it yet is because we're exposing them and they know our people are watching.
[03:24:32.042 --> 03:24:34.825]  We caught them with the CIA getting the underwear bomber on the plane.
[03:24:35.836 --> 03:24:39.059]  We broke that with the eyewitnesses, and it was confirmed later in Congress.
[03:24:39.500 --> 03:24:40.641]  We know the enemy.
[03:24:40.941 --> 03:24:42.163]  We know what they're planning.
[03:24:42.203 --> 03:24:43.384]  Do I know when they're going to strike?
[03:24:43.464 --> 03:24:43.724]  No.
[03:24:43.985 --> 03:24:47.548]  But I know what their modus operandi is, and I am sick of them!
[03:24:48.553 --> 03:24:55.658]  If people would just wake up to how evil this government is, and how illegitimate it is, and we would restore the republic, we wouldn't have to go through this.
[03:24:55.878 --> 03:25:00.682]  But the reason I'm upset is we are now up to the edge of the cliff with these people.
[03:25:01.442 --> 03:25:06.826]  We are now about to take the plunge, just as sure as the sun came up this morning, to the next level of this.
[03:25:07.867 --> 03:25:10.849]  You think they're not going for broke when the borders are wide open?
[03:25:12.039 --> 03:25:15.141]  When they're publicly funding Al Qaeda to run around and murder every Christian they can find?
[03:25:15.662 --> 03:25:17.603]  This is, they're going on all cylinders.
[03:25:17.623 --> 03:25:18.784]  They're going to launch everything.
[03:25:19.184 --> 03:25:20.705]  They're launching everything right now.
[03:25:21.306 --> 03:25:26.470]  In the scale of time, the next year, the next two years, is like a blink of an eye in the scale of humanity.
[03:25:26.690 --> 03:25:28.791]  And I'm telling you, right now is the war!
[03:25:29.132 --> 03:25:31.233]  Right now is the enemy coming over the gates!
[03:25:31.593 --> 03:25:33.315]  Right now, this is it, people!
[03:25:35.696 --> 03:25:37.538]  Chuck in Ohio, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[03:25:39.505 --> 03:25:44.629]  Yes, Alex, if I get one thing right on this call, I just want to say I'm proud to be crazy like Alex Jones.
[03:25:44.689 --> 03:25:47.631]  I wish you'd, on lighter days, I wish you'd play that song a little more.
[03:25:47.651 --> 03:25:48.592]  Thank you, you're a sweetheart.
[03:25:48.632 --> 03:25:48.992]  Go ahead.
[03:25:50.494 --> 03:25:55.277]  Okay, I want to talk about the Army document, but first I want to define the press.
[03:25:55.377 --> 03:26:00.561]  I haven't had television in three years, and just recently I started watching the evening news again.
[03:26:01.662 --> 03:26:04.965]  And I wanted to find them, you're always having trouble just, how do you describe them?
[03:26:06.186 --> 03:26:08.728]  And I want to describe them as the propaganda press.
[03:26:09.795 --> 03:26:12.837]  Kind of has Gerald Salente's alliteration in it.
[03:26:13.438 --> 03:26:14.218]  And it's what they are!
[03:26:14.278 --> 03:26:14.799]  They're Gerbils 2.0!
[03:26:15.960 --> 03:26:23.045]  For example, last night on NBC News, Brian Williams is at a piece on, be terrified of the sun.
[03:26:23.065 --> 03:26:30.610]  And of course the sun creates vitamin D, which prevents cancer, but be terrified of the sun because you might get cancer.
[03:26:31.931 --> 03:26:34.373]  Meanwhile, Brian Williams looks like he lives on a tanning bed.
[03:26:35.930 --> 03:26:37.371]  That's exactly right.
[03:26:37.431 --> 03:26:42.213]  Propaganda press, they're kind of in love with themselves and they're over two things.
[03:26:42.293 --> 03:26:46.174]  Watergate and the Civil Rights Movement.
[03:26:46.194 --> 03:26:48.135]  They think they're responsible for both of them.
[03:26:48.835 --> 03:26:54.978]  For exposing Watergate and for helping the Civil Rights Movement along.
[03:26:56.319 --> 03:26:59.020]  Well, I was wondering if you could do a what-if article.
[03:26:59.520 --> 03:27:03.101]  You take this new Army document and what-if in 1955.
[03:27:05.342 --> 03:27:19.128]  When Martin Luther King went to the side of Rosa Parks and had led a march, if they had shot Martin Luther King in the head, there would have been no civil rights movement, or at least it would have been very different.
[03:27:20.888 --> 03:27:23.089]  Well that's right, we should go at this at other angles.
[03:27:23.489 --> 03:27:23.730]  What if...
[03:27:28.931 --> 03:27:34.373]  This is Lexington and Concord, but they were armed at Lexington and Concord, and the Redcoats came up and shot at them.
[03:27:35.273 --> 03:27:38.774]  This is, we will shoot unarmed people as a PSYOP.
[03:27:38.854 --> 03:27:39.615]  It's in the document.
[03:27:39.655 --> 03:27:40.815]  People can go read the whole thing.
[03:27:41.375 --> 03:27:48.198]  We have it excised out in the subsections of the article, so people can check it, on how to kill unarmed people to scare the population.
[03:27:48.618 --> 03:27:50.038]  I mean, this is an indictment.
[03:27:50.478 --> 03:27:52.959]  You could put people in life in prison for this.
[03:27:53.459 --> 03:27:57.601]  This is a confession of treason by the people running our military.
[03:27:59.445 --> 03:27:59.725]  I agree.
[03:27:59.985 --> 03:28:05.228]  And the point is, the propaganda press, their whole identity is that they were part of the civil rights movement.
[03:28:05.708 --> 03:28:12.271]  Oh, they're a bunch of power-tripping prostitutes who now are all losing their jobs, which is what happens to traitors.
[03:28:12.811 --> 03:28:18.113]  They always think they're going to gain the world, selling everybody out, but instead they destroy their own future.
[03:28:19.994 --> 03:28:20.274]  Okay.
[03:28:20.474 --> 03:28:21.655]  Let's go to David in Kentucky.
[03:28:21.675 --> 03:28:22.435]  I gotta jump, Chuck.
[03:28:22.455 --> 03:28:22.955]  Thank you, buddy.
[03:28:22.975 --> 03:28:23.435]  Good points.
[03:28:23.736 --> 03:28:24.336]  Go ahead, David.
[03:28:25.404 --> 03:28:27.004]  Hey, hi Alex.
[03:28:27.024 --> 03:28:28.365]  I want you to check out a video.
[03:28:28.605 --> 03:28:32.826]  Go to Ferguson, Missouri Riots page on Facebook.
[03:28:32.886 --> 03:28:34.367]  Scroll down just a little bit.
[03:28:34.767 --> 03:28:45.110]  It's posted by a guy named Carl Lund spelled K-A-R-L-L-U-N-D and he is in where the old QT is.
[03:28:45.770 --> 03:28:49.911]  Him and five other people doing an amateur video caught up in the middle
[03:28:50.470 --> 03:29:05.162]  of gunfire and uh... you can see the uh... militarized police and the uh... m-rep going down the street looked like they're uh... hunting Osama bin Laden down and these bullets actually fly by these kids, these young kids filming.
[03:29:05.362 --> 03:29:07.064]  You can hear the pew pew pew.
[03:29:07.384 --> 03:29:08.125]  You can just hear it.
[03:29:08.445 --> 03:29:09.966]  So they're not rubber bullets?
[03:29:10.066 --> 03:29:12.628]  They're lead bullets?
[03:29:12.688 --> 03:29:14.490]  You can hear the gunshots and the police
[03:29:15.055 --> 03:29:16.516]  It's a 2 minute 38 video.
[03:29:17.076 --> 03:29:19.338]  Then the police turn around and tell him to get the F out of there.
[03:29:19.778 --> 03:29:21.039]  And he says, where?
[03:29:21.059 --> 03:29:21.699]  Which way to run?
[03:29:21.819 --> 03:29:23.200]  The guy filming the Carl Lund.
[03:29:23.400 --> 03:29:24.861]  Well no, our reporters have been there.
[03:29:24.921 --> 03:29:26.562]  Somebody is shooting at the police.
[03:29:27.782 --> 03:29:31.385]  Which is... I'm telling you, this is going bad really fast.
[03:29:31.665 --> 03:29:33.746]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:29:33.806 --> 03:29:35.687]  Shots fired during Ferguson protest.
[03:29:36.608 --> 03:29:40.150]  And we'll post that video to InfoWars.com.
[03:29:40.210 --> 03:29:41.130]  I was aware of that.
[03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:42.571]  But I'm glad you brought that up.
[03:29:42.611 --> 03:29:43.692]  I'm sorry to the other callers.
[03:29:44.232 --> 03:29:45.872]  We've got Iraq vets calling in.
[03:29:45.912 --> 03:29:47.553]  We've got folks who want to talk about Ferguson.
[03:29:48.033 --> 03:29:49.193]  But I've done three and a half hours.
[03:29:49.253 --> 03:29:50.693]  I'm too exhausted to go anymore.
[03:29:51.073 --> 03:29:52.594]  We'll be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:29:52.634 --> 03:29:53.434]  Central, Lord willing.

[03:29:58.815 --> 03:29:59.735]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.215 --> 03:30:01.815]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.736 --> 03:30:05.516]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:05.956 --> 03:30:07.236]  Radio Network.
[03:30:07.256 --> 03:30:09.557]  King George III or Santa Ana, Mexico?
