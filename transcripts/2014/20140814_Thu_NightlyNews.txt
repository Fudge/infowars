[00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:21.751]  Welcome to this live edition of the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:25.074]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo on this Thursday, August 14, 2014.
[00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:25.935]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:39.090]  Tonight, shocking video from the front lines of the Info War, as Ferguson Police deliberately target journalists.
[00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.551]  The truth about the Ferguson riots and martial law.
[00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:46.132]  Because the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:49.533]  That's up next on the Info War's Nightly News.
[00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:59.059]  We're going to be joining our reporters who are live on the scene in Ferguson, Missouri, tonight.
[00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:02.501]  But first, we want to break down for you what's been happening this last week.
[00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:10.425]  As Paul Joseph Watson pointed out in his story, data on Infowars.com, he said, Ferguson police were essentially AWOL back on Sunday when we had the looting.
[00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:16.087]  Yet last night, they were out in force to crush the First Amendment and to arrest journalists.
[00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:21.010]  With authorities attempting to enforce an arbitrary nighttime ban on protests and peaceful demonstrators,
[00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.453]  They were telling everyone last night, first you can come into one area, now you've got to move to another area.
[00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:35.498]  You've got to leave right away, and if you don't, that essentially gives them a pretest to arrest you, or they can gas you, or they can shoot you with rubber bullets.
[00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.181]  All of those things were happening last night to journalists, not just to peaceful demonstrators.
[00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:46.625]  Now, the journalists who were arrested were the Washington Post's Wesley Lowry and the Huffington Post's Ryan Riley.
[00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:49.267]  They were arrested, says the Washington Post reporter.
[00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:58.615]  He said it was a legal assault on the freedom of press to cover the news, and the Huffington Post reporter said he was handcuffed as he was charging his phone at a local McDonald's.
[00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:03.720]  He said the cops arrested him because he was photographing them, which, of course, is legal.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.163]  There is no expectation of privacy in a public area.
[00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:11.387]  There is no expectation of privacy in an area that is open to the public.
[00:02:11.707 --> 00:02:13.088]  In a business like McDonald's.
[00:02:13.348 --> 00:02:16.771]  He said he didn't pack his bag quickly enough, so they arrested him.
[00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:21.915]  They also got pretty rough with him, shoving them around, shoving them into the drink machine from what they said.
[00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:29.620]  Now, we've had witnesses tell us that they were allowing everybody to loot, and we have this other article on Infowars.com.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.183]  Eyewitness says Ferguson cops allowed everybody to loot.
[00:02:33.543 --> 00:02:35.004]  We've got an embedded report there.
[00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:36.085]  Let's go to that right now.
[00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:42.565]  This is essentially what they told us earlier today.
[00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:54.422]  The thing about it is they allowed everybody to loot Sunday.
[00:02:55.086 --> 00:02:55.787]  Yeah, that's what I heard.
[00:02:55.847 --> 00:03:03.472]  One of the guys we spoke to earlier said the cops were blocking an area and literally letting the masses drive by and then go into the shopping center.
[00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:09.437]  They surrounded the entire community at each end and let everybody loot and do everything they wanted to do.
[00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:12.299]  Do I know?
[00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:22.687]  I mean, when it comes down to it, I mean, this is all the ploy basically to make sure that everybody begins a war with the police.
[00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:36.174]  Even though they're rioting for a reason, for a cause, but of course they're going to try to use militia, they're going to try to use, you know, of course, the façade version of America, you know what I'm saying?
[00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:43.116]  The façade version of America just sees a bunch of people running around, hectic, and just wanting to destroy their community, and that's not what's going on right now.
[00:03:43.316 --> 00:03:45.736]  Making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:03:45.756 --> 00:03:48.057]  Exactly what he was telling us on Tuesday.
[00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:50.878]  We had another person that we interviewed from the area on Tuesday that
[00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:51.678]  Thank you.
[00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:20.530]  Absolutely, that was Adrian Hubbard and he thought that it was pretty suspicious actually that the cops were just sort of, they cordoned off the entire area and just allowed cars to drive in.
[00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.912]  They saw that things were getting really escalated there, things were being set on fire.
[00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:26.493]  People were really upset.
[00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:35.957]  Now granted, maybe it took a little time for the police to figure it all out tactically what they were going to do when they got the area cordoned off, but Adrian said
[00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:55.049]  There were clearly people coming in from other towns to take part in this free-for-all and basically just tearing everything down, causing this mayhem, this destruction, and he said it really appeared to him that they were allowing it to ramp up for what he thought was an excuse to use heavy police force.
[00:04:55.809 --> 00:05:04.612]  And, you know, there, he was a witness to the vigil, and he was at the peaceful vigil, saw the peaceful vigil escalate into this rioting.
[00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:07.793]  There, the police sort of shoved everyone off.
[00:05:07.813 --> 00:05:09.473]  They were like, your vigil is over.
[00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:14.675]  Because apparently, in Ferguson, Missouri, the First Amendment ends at dusk.
[00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:15.135]  Yeah.
[00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:17.395]  Yeah, it was a very different situation last night, wasn't it?
[00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:19.376]  They were deliberately tear-gassing journalists.
[00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.971]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:25.634]  And the First Amendment, it's not just the peaceful protesting that ends at dusk.
[00:05:26.214 --> 00:05:37.722]  Apparently, if you are a journalist or someone there with your cell phone and you're filming the apparent beatdown from the police that's about to happen, you're supposed to shut your phones off as well and stop recording.
[00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:44.486]  The Ferguson police told reporters to turn off their cameras before they began attacking the press.
[00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:49.550]  Now, reporters documenting the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, were told by the police
[00:05:49.970 --> 00:06:00.379]  To cease recording just moments before they launched an attack using LRAD sound cannons, flashbang grenades, tear gas canisters, and a hail of rubber bullets.
[00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.902]  And like we said, our reporters were struck by some of these rubber bullets.
[00:06:03.922 --> 00:06:05.023]  They got tear gassed.
[00:06:05.643 --> 00:06:12.929]  Josh unfortunately came over with a case of incessant vomiting because he just could not catch his breath.
[00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.491]  But like we've always said,
[00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:17.212]  No, do not turn off your cameras.
[00:06:17.232 --> 00:06:21.673]  You're not required to stop filming a police in a public situation such as this.
[00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:26.455]  You always keep the cameras rolling and that's why we were able to catch this clip right here.
[00:06:26.475 --> 00:06:37.980]  You must leave your vehicles, leave your homes immediately.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.360]  Please turn off your video.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.261]  I think he said, did he say, please turn off your video?
[00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:44.142]  That's what it sounded like to me.
[00:06:47.093 --> 00:06:49.154]  Did they just tell us to turn off and stop filming?
[00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:51.676]  I think that's what they said, honestly.
[00:06:51.776 --> 00:06:57.500]  I think they said, please turn off your video?
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.142]  That's what it sounded like to me.
[00:07:00.162 --> 00:07:07.206]  Did they just tell us to turn off and stop filming?
[00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:09.728]  I think that's what they said, honestly.
[00:07:09.768 --> 00:07:11.629]  Trapping everybody in?
[00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:12.190]  They tried to.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.090]  Front line of the infoward, Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson, Josh Owens, the front line as they advance on it.
[00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:29.549]  So this is apparently a new tactic that they're using.
[00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:39.419]  Not only are they shutting down peaceful protests, but now they're trying to... I mean, this was a pre-recorded voice coming out of the MRAP vehicles, I mean, saying, turn your cameras off.
[00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.780]  So they had prepared for this.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.201]  They knew there were journalists there.
[00:07:42.282 --> 00:07:47.687]  I mean, it's kind of... Well, what happened subsequently, it was very clear that they were targeting journalists, wasn't it?
[00:07:48.086 --> 00:08:05.759]  Yeah absolutely and you know that's just one of those interesting things is that here we have everyone with their cell phones they can't tell everyone to turn their cameras off but what what happens when they get that kill switch in all the phones that they're just so desperate to to get in all of our phones by 2015 in fact but last night
[00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:15.526]  Big said that he was aware that they were specifically targeting journalists and they were specifically coming after journalists.
[00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:17.888]  We saw them tear gassing journalists.
[00:08:18.268 --> 00:08:24.233]  Ja'Kari Jackson was there with Al Jazeera when the canisters were thrown directly at
[00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:29.536]  You see them preparing to do a live camera shot of a scene there.
[00:08:29.936 --> 00:08:39.503]  They are hit with a round of tear gas and then you'll see footage that shows militarized police then confiscating their cameras.
[00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:47.088]  They dismantle their camera equipment and another officer points a sniper rifle at the fleeing reporters.
[00:08:47.448 --> 00:08:51.691]  So you want to talk about looting the police or looting the press?
[00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:58.653]  Yeah, I want to get Jakari Jackson's take on this because he was standing right there with those Al Jazeera reporters when they did that.
[00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:01.474]  And there's an amazing story from Fox News.
[00:09:02.154 --> 00:09:08.476]  They said despite reports SWAT teams helped Al Jazeera reporters, did not take their equipment.
[00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:12.738]  They say the SWAT team was actually helping the journalists in Ferguson and not taking their equipment.
[00:09:13.098 --> 00:09:19.120]  In fact, last night, this is the Sheriff's Department, that they're of course just repeating his press releases verbatim.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.280]  That's what the mainstream media does.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:35.137]  They say, in fact, last night the SWAT team officers were assisting the media in moving their camera equipment and media personnel to a safer area with their consent so that they could continue to cover the event.
[00:09:35.277 --> 00:09:35.637]  That's it.
[00:09:35.677 --> 00:09:40.363]  They were just gassing them to motivate them to move to a safer area, right?
[00:09:40.543 --> 00:09:44.826]  When you look at the video, and let's take a look at this video right now, it's absolutely amazing.
[00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:50.710]  See, if this looks like they're just trying to move them to a safer area with their consent.
[00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:55.314]  You see them getting multiple tear gas canisters shot at them right there.
[00:09:55.754 --> 00:09:57.035]  They've got all their lights set up.
[00:09:57.135 --> 00:10:00.077]  I don't think that they wanted to move from that area.
[00:10:00.217 --> 00:10:02.499]  No, he was about to go do a live on there.
[00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:08.784]  Yeah, and if you look at this, you'll see Ja'Kari Jackson right off on the right-hand side of the screen, just on the other side of that sign, running with them.
[00:10:09.624 --> 00:10:12.586]  Now, what is interesting is what happens afterwards.
[00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:15.488]  Now, they're not taking their camera equipment, actually.
[00:10:15.728 --> 00:10:17.069]  They're taking down the lights.
[00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:17.970]  They're turning down the lights.
[00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.672]  They don't want to have lights shown on what they're doing.
[00:10:21.112 --> 00:10:29.217]  But you'll also see as we move along on this video here, let's fast forward that up to the point where they come out there with the MRAP or the military vehicle.
[00:10:29.397 --> 00:10:29.738]  There they are.
[00:10:29.758 --> 00:10:30.938]  They're taking the lights down.
[00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:38.744]  And then after they do this, watch this guy goes back to the camera and he actually points the camera down.
[00:10:39.644 --> 00:10:46.048]  So, he's leaving the most expensive piece of equipment up on the tripod, but he doesn't want it to record anything.
[00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:49.150]  So, I don't think they were looking after them.
[00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:54.974]  I don't think they were helping them to move to another area so they could continue to film in another area.
[00:10:55.774 --> 00:10:59.578]  And they say that, and this is the last thing here, they say the position of the St.
[00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:07.826]  Charles County Sheriff's Department is that the media has a right to cover these events and we support the freedom of press.
[00:11:08.247 --> 00:11:16.495]  And that's why, Leanne, they ordered everybody and threatened everybody they would be arrested if they didn't stop recording because they support freedom of the press.
[00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:17.735]  This is Orwellian.
[00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:29.660]  This is like North Korean level of absurdity that we're seeing from Fox News putting out these press releases from the sheriff's office saying that they were just there helping the reporters in that area.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:39.803]  Right, well clearly that's why they had all the MRAP vehicles and the LRAD cannons and all the rubber bullets and everything because they were clearly protecting everyone's First Amendment rights.
[00:11:39.843 --> 00:11:40.583]  That's what they were.
[00:11:40.623 --> 00:11:44.945]  I felt a lot safer when the militarized police showed up, especially for our reporters.
[00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:45.705]  That's right.
[00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:55.789]  Well, in this next article from Kit Daniels, press suppression, InfoWars Twitter account suspended twice within 12 hours of creation, this is something that isn't quite as obvious as that.
[00:11:55.809 --> 00:12:08.774]  I mean, when you look at what they're physically doing, when they're shooting tear gas at reporters, when they're taking down their lighting, when they're turning their cameras to the ground and chasing these guys off, pointing guns at them as they're running, that's pretty obvious censorship, isn't it?
[00:12:09.651 --> 00:12:14.434]  Less obvious censorship is when they go onto social media and start controlling that.
[00:12:14.454 --> 00:12:24.701]  We've been telling you about the many defense contracts that have been coming out, trying to get companies to come on and do this type of work, and that's exactly what's going on.
[00:12:24.741 --> 00:12:26.022]  Now we see the fruits of this.
[00:12:26.522 --> 00:12:31.286]  We see in this article from Kit Daniels, he's talking about how, for a year, he's had a Twitter account.
[00:12:31.406 --> 00:12:33.688]  He's posted all kinds of InfoWars content on that.
[00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:47.519]  And yet, last night, when he started up with a brand new Kit Daniels 1776, he used it only once to tweet out an InfoWars video showing what was going on in Ferguson, Missouri, with police snipers targeting unarmed protesters.
[00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:52.823]  And he says, within hours, it was suspended as a, quote, suspected spam account.
[00:12:53.243 --> 00:12:59.105]  And he had to go back with CAPTCHA validation to unlock it and then not long after that, they shut it down again.
[00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:04.566]  It's now still down because it requires a mobile phone number to unlock and he's not giving that to them.
[00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:14.349]  He points out that in comparison, another Twitter account under Kit Daniels, he said, has been suspended for, has never been suspended and it's nearly one year existence.
[00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:20.811]  He also points out that the main Twitter account from the official Alex Jones, the real Alex Jones account,
[00:13:21.391 --> 00:13:23.673]  He says that was blocked from sending tweets last night.
[00:13:23.873 --> 00:13:28.856]  Multiple users of Facebook also reported they were unable to share YouTube videos by InfoWars.
[00:13:29.217 --> 00:13:31.939]  And of course, we've seen in the past that this has happened.
[00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:41.266]  Also last night, Facebook was adding erroneous code to shortened InfoWars.com URLs yesterday so that people would not get the correct link.
[00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:44.107]  This is something that's been going on quite some time.
[00:13:44.847 --> 00:13:46.928]  We've had this happen in the past, of course.
[00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:54.131]  Facebook suspended 20 accounts last year, actually in late 2012, because they said that they violated Facebook policies.
[00:13:54.171 --> 00:14:02.494]  They threatened to close Alex Jones' account over an image of Osama bin Laden with the words Al-CIA written underneath it.
[00:14:02.534 --> 00:14:08.137]  Because, of course, we know that the CIA created Al-Qaeda, just as they have created ISIS,
[00:14:08.837 --> 00:14:08.917]  Yes.
[00:14:31.843 --> 00:14:35.845]  Data Mining Company had been acquired by Palantir.
[00:14:36.206 --> 00:14:39.067]  Now, in case you don't know who Palantir are, we've covered that as well.
[00:14:39.107 --> 00:14:45.311]  They were involved with, the first time they came under scrutiny, with the Snowden Document Links, when that program, PRISM, was out there.
[00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:52.354]  Palantir is a company that was created with venture funding from the CIA, from In-Q-Tel, their venture capital company.
[00:14:53.135 --> 00:14:55.276]  Openly funded by the CIA, I would add.
[00:14:55.316 --> 00:14:58.758]  Now they are buying this company, which is a data mining company,
[00:14:59.943 --> 00:15:10.288]  Forbes asked, why in the world would Palantir, who's basically working for the intelligence community, why would they acquire a company that has basically been looking at social media and looking at trends?
[00:15:10.828 --> 00:15:23.834]  One of their most famous episodes is when they monitored an awards program, and they were looking for people who were A, looking at that program, and B, talking about hairstyles of some particular actresses.
[00:15:24.494 --> 00:15:33.362]  And if you were interested in the particular hairstyles of those particular actresses, they immediately sent you some information selling you some hair products.
[00:15:33.382 --> 00:15:34.523]  That was very successful.
[00:15:34.963 --> 00:15:51.318]  Not long after that then, Palantir bought them because they want to be able to monitor and data mine instantly in real time and make the kind of adjustments that we saw happening to Kit Daniel's Twitter account, to the Alex Jones Twitter account, and to our Facebook accounts.
[00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:54.465]  This is very troubling to see this kind of thing happening.
[00:15:54.845 --> 00:16:01.307]  That's the kind of not so subtle, or very subtle I should say, censorship that we're seeing.
[00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:03.408]  It's not in your face like the other stuff.
[00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:08.130]  Yeah, well and in the meantime, before they can control it, they're going to have their trolls and their government bots.
[00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:08.990]  I think so.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:34.386]  Journalists photojournalists in that vehicle and just getting bombed with these Cannons and with the flashbang cannons and and he was frightened terrified.
[00:16:34.406 --> 00:16:45.532]  Yes for 30 minutes They were there just unloading on him and here we see the Ferguson's police chief freaks out after he found out that his cops are
[00:16:45.732 --> 00:16:47.272]  Had arrested two journalists.
[00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:49.013]  Two mainstream journalists?
[00:16:49.033 --> 00:16:49.833]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:49.853 --> 00:16:50.873]  Washington Post and Huffington Post.
[00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:58.234]  You know, it's not that they're, you know, firing flash grenades on photojournalists, but they've arrested two mainstream journalists.
[00:16:58.794 --> 00:17:05.256]  Chief Thomas Jackson was shocked and he reportedly said, oh God, after he learned of these arrests.
[00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:08.216]  And he claimed that he immediately called the St.
[00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:12.497]  Louis County Police Department, of course, to say, let these guys go, you have no idea.
[00:17:13.297 --> 00:17:13.397]  What
[00:17:30.809 --> 00:17:31.429]  We're good to go.
[00:17:52.131 --> 00:17:56.315]  Well, and of course, everybody has the right to film in public.
[00:17:56.776 --> 00:17:58.617]  It's not just the Washington Post.
[00:17:58.658 --> 00:18:10.149]  But when you arrest a Washington Post reporter, when you shove these guys into the drink machine because they won't turn off their iPhones, that has repercussions, doesn't it?
[00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:11.771]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:18.098]  And, you know, it could possibly be the reason why kind of these reports are changing by the hour.
[00:18:18.158 --> 00:18:25.326]  But the FBI initially was going to start taking over the control of the police operations there in Ferguson.
[00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:28.830]  Now they're saying highway police are going to be taking control over it.
[00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.872]  So obviously the governor of Missouri, he relieved St.
[00:18:31.892 --> 00:18:38.876]  Louis County law enforcement from policing these ongoing demonstrations, now putting the highway patrol in charge.
[00:18:39.676 --> 00:18:50.443]  Obviously it looks like a war zone there, so they're really kind of concerned about how the local police department there is actually handling this entire situation.
[00:18:50.683 --> 00:18:56.628]  I think we're going to see the FBI essentially taking over the investigation.
[00:18:57.309 --> 00:19:08.318]  And that's really what is behind all of this from the very beginning, is not only the brutality of the police to shoot someone down like that, which is what the eyewitnesses say.
[00:19:09.013 --> 00:19:24.689]  But when you've got a major conflict in stories between what a lot of eyewitnesses say, when the police immediately confiscate the cameras again of the eyewitnesses there, and when they essentially look like they're trying to cover this up as opposed to being transparent and out there,
[00:19:25.069 --> 00:19:32.192]  I think the FBI is going to investigate this, but the FBI doesn't have the manpower to police it, so I think they're going to put the highway police out there.
[00:19:32.492 --> 00:19:38.355]  It's a very different scene today, and we're going to see that as we go to our reporters who are live in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:19:39.135 --> 00:19:41.597]  We saw looting and riot on Sunday.
[00:19:41.677 --> 00:19:45.638]  We saw them attacking peaceful protesters last night.
[00:19:47.139 --> 00:19:54.786]  Coming after them last night, it was a very intensive, very confrontational attitude, and we've got some law enforcement reactions to that.
[00:19:55.066 --> 00:20:00.311]  But I wanted to take a look at what the politicians are saying, because we've got some interesting reactions from politicians.
[00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:06.196]  We've got a Democrat congressman from Georgia, John Lewis, talking about what he thinks should happen.
[00:20:06.977 --> 00:20:10.859]  He starts out with the right thing, and he comes to an amazing conclusion here.
[00:20:11.239 --> 00:20:13.220]  He says people have the right to protest.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.620]  He's talking on MSNBC.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:23.084]  He says they have the right to dissent, they have the right to march in an orderly, peaceful, non-violent fashion, and the press has a right to cover it.
[00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:25.605]  Ferguson, Missouri is not Congo.
[00:20:26.005 --> 00:20:26.845]  It's not China.
[00:20:26.865 --> 00:20:27.726]  It's not Russia.
[00:20:27.806 --> 00:20:28.506]  We can do better.
[00:20:29.006 --> 00:20:30.487]  Now here's what he wants.
[00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:37.450]  President Obama should use the authority of his office to declare martial law, otherwise the National Guard will protect people as they protest.
[00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.950]  I don't think so.
[00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:48.615]  I mean, here he is, he's talking about how we don't want to have martial law, and he's talking about how this is not the Congo, this is not China, this is Russia, and then he wants Obama to act as if it's
[00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:52.116]  China, Russia and the Congo, which is martial law.
[00:20:52.476 --> 00:20:53.216]  It's what we have.
[00:20:53.276 --> 00:20:54.776]  Martial law is the problem.
[00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:55.496]  Can't you see that?
[00:20:55.896 --> 00:20:57.377]  And so then what does Obama do?
[00:20:57.437 --> 00:21:05.338]  Today he has a brief press conference and he essentially does a can't we all just get along kind of a Rodney King type of thing.
[00:21:05.378 --> 00:21:08.939]  He says, well, there's never an excuse for violence against the police.
[00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:10.239]  Wait a minute.
[00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:13.160]  Was there violence against the police last night?
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:14.361]  No.
[00:21:14.601 --> 00:21:16.643]  There wasn't any violence against the police.
[00:21:16.743 --> 00:21:20.888]  The police, as our reporters were pointing out, they were itching for a fight.
[00:21:20.928 --> 00:21:27.796]  As Joe Big said, he could see a guy standing there with a billy club, kind of twirling it with a smirk on his face.
[00:21:27.816 --> 00:21:28.797]  They were itching for
[00:21:28.797 --> 00:21:29.677]  We're good to go.
[00:21:54.048 --> 00:21:54.608]  That's fine.
[00:21:54.809 --> 00:21:58.090]  But, you know, that really talks around the problem.
[00:21:58.231 --> 00:22:07.596]  Because to say, you know, let's just all get along, we've got... What Obama is saying is, look, you guys on that side messed up a little bit, and you guys over here messed up a little bit.
[00:22:08.117 --> 00:22:09.758]  That's not really the issue.
[00:22:10.318 --> 00:22:11.799]  Rand Paul got to the issue.
[00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:15.361]  He said, we have to demilitarize the police.
[00:22:15.841 --> 00:22:18.063]  This is a story from Time Magazine today.
[00:22:18.343 --> 00:22:21.565]  He said, if I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager,
[00:22:22.045 --> 00:22:28.327]  There would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off to the cop, but I wouldn't have expected to be shot.
[00:22:28.708 --> 00:22:31.789]  And that's what eyewitness accounts are saying happened there.
[00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:36.811]  And then he goes on to quote in this op-ed piece, Cato Institute's Walter Olson.
[00:22:36.831 --> 00:22:37.111]  He said,
[00:22:37.771 --> 00:22:41.093]  Why are armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb?
[00:22:41.553 --> 00:22:47.817]  Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors?
[00:22:47.837 --> 00:22:48.597]  Well, you know why they would.
[00:22:48.637 --> 00:22:50.198]  They want to intimidate people.
[00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:51.799]  They want to look like soldiers.
[00:22:52.199 --> 00:22:56.182]  And they look like soldiers, except for the small police patch there.
[00:22:56.682 --> 00:23:04.807]  He says, why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran looking at the Ferguson police scene comment,
[00:23:05.307 --> 00:23:09.210]  We rolled lighter than that in an actual war zone.
[00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.133]  In other words, we weren't that heavily armored when we were fighting abroad.
[00:23:13.353 --> 00:23:14.954]  That's the amazing thing about this.
[00:23:15.355 --> 00:23:21.139]  And Rand Paul points out with a series of quotes and articles going back through the history as we have many, many times.
[00:23:21.439 --> 00:23:25.703]  He says there is a systemic problem with today's law enforcement.
[00:23:26.283 --> 00:23:29.704]  And that systemic problem is coming from the federal government.
[00:23:29.744 --> 00:23:31.065]  It's coming from Homeland Security.
[00:23:31.405 --> 00:23:34.966]  It's coming from the federal government, which is trying to change the rules of engagement.
[00:23:35.306 --> 00:23:40.908]  It has been working for a very long time to militarize our police, to give them a mindset that
[00:23:41.428 --> 00:23:59.960]  They are some kind of a paramilitary, or actually a military organization, that the people that they're there supposedly to protect are quote-unquote civilians, and now they're teaching them that those civilians are essentially counterinsurgency threats to them, wouldn't you say?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.840]  How do you feel about that?
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.142]  What do you think about these political reactions, Liam?
[00:24:03.663 --> 00:24:09.026]  Well, I mean, I just think it's a little insane to say we need to declare martial law there.
[00:24:09.186 --> 00:24:10.987]  It appears as though it's already been declared.
[00:24:11.027 --> 00:24:12.108]  I mean, there's a curfew.
[00:24:12.128 --> 00:24:13.809]  It would be better if we declare it.
[00:24:13.829 --> 00:24:14.889]  Saying it without saying it.
[00:24:15.069 --> 00:24:16.990]  Right, yeah, to actually go out there and say it.
[00:24:17.431 --> 00:24:24.134]  But the Department of Homeland Security is the one that is responsible for arming these small town police departments.
[00:24:24.194 --> 00:24:24.675]  Obviously, St.
[00:24:24.715 --> 00:24:26.736]  Louis is a little bit bigger, but I mean, we see small town
[00:24:27.136 --> 00:24:37.183]  Indiana or here in Austin, like other small towns, are getting grants from the Department of Homeland Security for armored vehicles, guns, aircraft.
[00:24:37.644 --> 00:24:41.267]  Well, besides the billions of rounds of ammunition, Homeland Security has gotten, they've purchased 2,700 MRAPs.
[00:24:43.368 --> 00:24:48.153]  And we're being told that they're bringing 13,000 MRAPs to America.
[00:24:48.193 --> 00:24:52.136]  They've already put out 600 or so, many of them in very small communities.
[00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:56.841]  So this is something that they're planning on this getting much, much larger.
[00:24:56.901 --> 00:25:03.507]  Now, the reaction then is that this police chief is basically being told to stand down by the governor.
[00:25:03.547 --> 00:25:05.289]  They're putting the highway patrol in charge.
[00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:08.230]  Perhaps they're putting the FBI in charge of the investigation.
[00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:11.352]  And now we have a former police chief speaking out.
[00:25:11.412 --> 00:25:18.636]  This is an article today on Infowars.com saying that the Ferguson military gear was, quote, an act of provocation.
[00:25:18.676 --> 00:25:20.697]  Now this is a former Seattle police chief.
[00:25:21.138 --> 00:25:22.058]  He has been there.
[00:25:22.198 --> 00:25:22.939]  He's done that.
[00:25:23.099 --> 00:25:24.039]  He's made the mistake.
[00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:32.164]  He's admitted that he made the mistake because he said what happened in Seattle in 1999 was a police overreaction.
[00:25:32.204 --> 00:25:33.985]  That was when he was police chief there.
[00:25:34.525 --> 00:25:37.868]  And he said, it was the worst mistake of my career.
[00:25:38.369 --> 00:25:47.597]  We used chemical agents, which is a euphemism for tear gas, that's what they did last night in Ferguson, against non-violent and essentially non-threatening protesters.
[00:25:47.777 --> 00:25:50.119]  That's what they did last night in Ferguson.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:55.464]  He said, if they're out there in military gear from the beginning, that's an act of provocation.
[00:25:56.005 --> 00:25:59.048]  We just simply need to use defusing techniques.
[00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:06.513]  He said that a heavy-handed response to the World Trade Organization riots in Seattle was what he was talking about back in 1999.
[00:26:06.853 --> 00:26:13.738]  He went on to say, and specifically point out, that one of the things that he was concerned about was the intimidation by attack dogs.
[00:26:13.778 --> 00:26:17.361]  And this is something I noticed, Leanne, when we were getting live feed from them.
[00:26:18.242 --> 00:26:22.905]  We saw these guys coming out, how heavily armed they were, and even coming out with the police dogs.
[00:26:22.925 --> 00:26:25.066]  And of course, they had heavy police dogs there last night.
[00:26:25.106 --> 00:26:28.189]  He said, there is a real place for dogs and police work.
[00:26:28.689 --> 00:26:32.410]  But not in the context of a non-violent protest.
[00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:42.772]  In fact, using dogs for crowd control is operationally, substantively, and from an image point of view, about the worst thing you can do.
[00:26:42.852 --> 00:26:54.555]  He said we should have learned that lesson as an institution back in the 1960s in Birmingham, Alabama, when Bull Connor unleashed his police dogs on non-violent civil rights demonstrators.
[00:26:54.955 --> 00:26:59.357]  He was essentially saying to those peaceful, protesting Americans, you are the enemy.
[00:26:59.397 --> 00:27:09.161]  We've been told that we are the enemy in a gazillion different ways, haven't we, by the Homeland Security purchases, and of course, just as we did back in April when
[00:27:10.382 --> 00:27:12.024]  Joe Biggs and I were in Virginia.
[00:27:12.084 --> 00:27:24.356]  We walked through an American town that they had built so they could practice their militarized police force or their counterinsurgency techniques by the Asymmetric Warfare Center.
[00:27:24.516 --> 00:27:26.278]  This is the Army doing this.
[00:27:26.698 --> 00:27:32.840]  Setting up this for training police as well as for training Army to tell the American people you are the enemy.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:47.505]  If you can't see that you're the enemy based on all of their scenarios, all of their purchases, all of their training facilities, and now based on these actual things that they did last night, I don't know what it takes to get the American people to see this.
[00:27:47.805 --> 00:27:49.746]  Right, the terrorists are us.
[00:27:49.967 --> 00:27:57.372]  Anyone that might stand up to their tyranny is seen as the actual threat to their national interest.
[00:27:57.412 --> 00:28:00.174]  It's not our national interest anymore.
[00:28:00.354 --> 00:28:01.474]  Now it's theirs.
[00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:06.058]  And we're told, just like Obama is saying, he wants to de-escalate everything.
[00:28:06.118 --> 00:28:07.719]  So let's everybody just get along.
[00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:08.940]  We've made mistakes on both sides.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.421]  Let's everybody just go back.
[00:28:11.001 --> 00:28:17.206]  Put your feet up, watch a ball game, have some brew or something, just calm down and don't do anything.
[00:28:17.807 --> 00:28:19.348]  I don't think that's the answer.
[00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:23.332]  When I go back and look at this, it was years ago, and I want to read this.
[00:28:23.352 --> 00:28:27.856]  This is something that we have this quote from Pastor Martin Niemoller all the time.
[00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:29.898]  He said, first I came for this group, I didn't do anything.
[00:28:30.218 --> 00:28:32.780]  And there is certainly an element, and Rand Paul made that clear.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.622]  He said, if you don't see that this is coming after the black community,
[00:28:36.263 --> 00:28:38.845]  Disproportionately, the rest of them, you're not paying attention.
[00:28:39.145 --> 00:28:39.425]  Okay?
[00:28:39.746 --> 00:28:41.327]  So we talk about that quote all the time.
[00:28:41.367 --> 00:28:42.508]  Everybody's very familiar with that.
[00:28:42.848 --> 00:28:47.491]  You may not be familiar with the quote from the Stuttgart Declaration.
[00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:53.215]  He said, and this is what Pastor Martin Niemöller, the guy who said, first they came for that group, I didn't do anything.
[00:28:53.255 --> 00:28:55.037]  They come for that group, I didn't do anything.
[00:28:55.317 --> 00:28:57.058]  Then they came for me and there was nobody to help me.
[00:28:57.739 --> 00:29:00.421]  After the war, he got a lot of churches together and he says,
[00:29:01.201 --> 00:29:03.682]  He wrote up a confession for them to sign.
[00:29:03.722 --> 00:29:08.724]  He said, Through us, infinite wrong was brought over many peoples and countries.
[00:29:09.225 --> 00:29:14.847]  That which we often testify to in our communities, we express now in the name of the whole church.
[00:29:15.328 --> 00:29:24.232]  We did fight for long years in the name of Jesus Christ against the mentality that found its awful expression in the Nazis, in a regime of violence.
[00:29:24.352 --> 00:29:28.954]  But we accuse ourselves for not standing to our beliefs more courageously,
[00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:35.722]  For not praying more faithfully, for not believing more joyously, and for not loving more ardently.
[00:29:35.742 --> 00:29:37.504]  You know, that bothers me.
[00:29:37.805 --> 00:29:40.388]  Because that's what the church is not doing today.
[00:29:40.808 --> 00:29:44.934]  I don't see people, there shouldn't have just been black people coming out there protesting last night.
[00:29:45.234 --> 00:29:47.115]  They should have had the entire town out there.
[00:29:47.436 --> 00:29:56.241]  If we can put ourselves at risk trying to help people in Africa who are suffering from Ebola, why can't we stop this cancer in our country?
[00:29:56.302 --> 00:30:01.505]  Why can't we stand up and have the courage to get out there and do something as a church?
[00:30:02.065 --> 00:30:11.011]  The people who are the moral leaders of our community should be going out there and standing up and saying, you're not going to turn our country into a militarized hellhole.
[00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:13.513]  We're not going to let you do that to our families, to our country.
[00:30:13.533 --> 00:30:14.874]  We're not going to let you destroy this.
[00:30:15.034 --> 00:30:17.176]  Right, these are all Americans there.
[00:30:17.536 --> 00:30:28.924]  We're all Americans together and that's the divide and conquer tactic they try with this racial tension so that we won't have sympathy or empathy if we're not the same color as whoever is fighting the battle.
[00:30:29.525 --> 00:30:39.472]  You know, you can see the racial bias there when the mainstream media was reporting yesterday and they were just continuing to push this point about how Michael Brown had no criminal background.
[00:30:40.202 --> 00:30:40.402]  Yes.
[00:30:40.842 --> 00:30:47.745]  Okay, so if he had a criminal background, would that justify the police officer shooting him unarmed, allegedly?
[00:30:47.765 --> 00:30:49.406]  Yes.
[00:30:49.486 --> 00:31:04.732]  And the original versions that I saw of this in the local news, from the police standpoint, we heard a very different story from the eyewitnesses, but from the police standpoint, he tried to arrest him, there was a struggle, a shot went off, but then he ran away.
[00:31:05.592 --> 00:31:15.276]  As he's running away back to the officer with his hands in the air, and the officer shoots him multiple times, that by any rules of engagement should be murder.
[00:31:15.316 --> 00:31:20.658]  They ought to clear the decks on all of their court cases, move this to the very front,
[00:31:21.098 --> 00:31:21.959]  Accelerate this.
[00:31:22.039 --> 00:31:27.704]  I know that the officer who's there needs to have his day in court as well, but they need to start that process.
[00:31:27.744 --> 00:31:28.744]  They need to be open about it.
[00:31:29.025 --> 00:31:34.149]  They need to not be confiscating the recordings of that from eyewitnesses.
[00:31:34.229 --> 00:31:38.312]  That tells people that there's not going to be a good day, an honest day in court.
[00:31:38.332 --> 00:31:38.773]  Right.
[00:31:39.133 --> 00:31:40.534]  Now, there is some hope.
[00:31:40.834 --> 00:31:41.634]  There is some hope.
[00:31:41.674 --> 00:31:45.916]  We had a program sheriff that we have interviewed here at the Nightly News.
[00:31:46.356 --> 00:31:48.057]  We also had him on the radio program.
[00:31:48.157 --> 00:31:50.838]  This is Sheriff David Clark from Milwaukee County.
[00:31:51.238 --> 00:31:52.278]  He was running for re-election.
[00:31:52.318 --> 00:32:00.722]  Now, this is a primary in the Democrat primary, and there's no Republican in the race, so essentially the winner of this primary last night is the winner by default.
[00:32:01.741 --> 00:32:09.948]  This was a situation because he is pro-gun, because he ran a commercial, and this is one of the reasons why we had him on the radio show.
[00:32:10.448 --> 00:32:13.211]  He ran a commercial and he said, I'm Sheriff David Clark.
[00:32:13.791 --> 00:32:16.673]  I want to talk to you about something personal, your safety.
[00:32:17.214 --> 00:32:18.855]  It's no longer a spectator sport.
[00:32:19.215 --> 00:32:20.557]  I need you in the game.
[00:32:20.657 --> 00:32:21.157]  Are you ready?
[00:32:21.838 --> 00:32:27.142]  With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option.
[00:32:27.162 --> 00:32:27.622]  We're good to go.
[00:32:48.334 --> 00:32:48.634]  Great.
[00:32:49.415 --> 00:32:50.756]  What happened in response to that?
[00:32:51.477 --> 00:32:56.842]  Well, Bloomberg's gun control group ran massive ads to defeat him.
[00:32:57.263 --> 00:33:03.329]  They spent half a million dollars to defeat him in a sheriff's race, in a county sheriff's race.
[00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:08.714]  They spent more money than David Clark and his opponent spent combined.
[00:33:09.475 --> 00:33:10.215]  And they lost.
[00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:12.813]  Bloomberg just doesn't get it.
[00:33:12.873 --> 00:33:24.856]  You may have seen this commercial that we played on the nightly news where the Bloomberg organization started out with a violent knock at the door and a lady on the phone trying to call 9-1-1 and the guy breaks in.
[00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:27.337]  Then he grabs the baby and a struggle starts.
[00:33:27.757 --> 00:33:31.038]  And you're looking at this and saying, 9-1-1 can't help you.
[00:33:31.078 --> 00:33:32.859]  That's what the sheriff was telling these people.
[00:33:33.459 --> 00:33:41.645]  It's good to see that we have honest sheriffs, and it's good to see that they are being supported by the people there, that they defeated Bloomberg in this.
[00:33:42.305 --> 00:33:48.249]  Absolutely, and it is always when things like this sort of bubble up to the surface, there are good things coming out of this.
[00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:57.696]  Obviously, the fact that America has an over-militarized police force has now come into the collective consciousness of America.
[00:33:57.736 --> 00:34:02.199]  We're seeing Newsweek and CNN and all of the mainstream media are all reporting on
[00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:02.899]  I don't
[00:34:18.072 --> 00:34:18.432]  We're good.
[00:34:34.686 --> 00:34:35.186]  After dark.
[00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:40.789]  And so a lot of the protesters there were asking the reporters to stay last night.
[00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:46.372]  They said, could you stay tonight because after you left is when they started firing the tear gas and everything.
[00:34:46.412 --> 00:34:48.193]  So this time the reporters stayed.
[00:34:48.673 --> 00:34:55.156]  And so it appears that that's, you know, what the police were hoping for is to just wait until their nine o'clock curfew.
[00:34:55.376 --> 00:34:56.357]  But it's not martial law.
[00:34:56.617 --> 00:34:57.778]  Nothing's been declared yet.
[00:34:57.798 --> 00:34:58.178]  Right.
[00:34:58.558 --> 00:34:59.258]  Just follow their rules.
[00:34:59.278 --> 00:34:59.558]  Semantics.
[00:34:59.799 --> 00:35:00.019]  Yeah.
[00:35:00.299 --> 00:35:00.479]  Right.
[00:35:00.859 --> 00:35:04.262]  Well, we have a report showing what happened yesterday.
[00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:15.991]  We want to show you what it looked like during the day, and we want to show you what it looked like at night, and then we're going to come back and go to our reporters who are live there tonight and talk about how things have changed in the last 24 hours.
[00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:17.251]  Here are those reports.
[00:35:19.713 --> 00:35:26.198]  Look, okay, now it looks like to me this guy is aiming a gun right at the area where Joe Biggs is at.
[00:35:27.499 --> 00:35:29.561]  Look at this guy.
[00:35:30.549 --> 00:35:32.310]  And look at this guy, too.
[00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.693]  Look, they follow the line of sight here.
[00:35:40.516 --> 00:35:41.277]  And this is what they do.
[00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:45.279]  Yeah.
[00:35:45.319 --> 00:35:46.821]  Oh, here they go!
[00:35:47.421 --> 00:35:49.122]  Here they go!
[00:35:49.142 --> 00:35:49.502]  Right here!
[00:35:49.522 --> 00:35:49.623]  Look!
[00:35:49.683 --> 00:35:49.903]  Look!
[00:35:49.943 --> 00:35:51.544]  Here we go!
[00:35:51.644 --> 00:35:52.565]  Here we go!
[00:35:52.765 --> 00:35:53.065]  Look!
[00:35:53.605 --> 00:35:57.088]  And I can leave my boy Joe over here by himself.
[00:35:58.008 --> 00:35:59.770]  I'm gonna get over here with him.
[00:36:02.706 --> 00:36:04.428]  As you can see they are
[00:36:25.293 --> 00:36:28.555]  Moving in numbers and starting to forcefully push people back.
[00:36:28.615 --> 00:36:31.097]  Hey Joe, why don't you tell these guys one of your military stories?
[00:36:31.297 --> 00:36:32.578]  This is sidewalk.
[00:36:32.898 --> 00:36:34.419]  I'm on the sidewalk.
[00:36:34.739 --> 00:36:35.760]  I'm on the sidewalk.
[00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:47.344]  And like I said, inch by inch, this is how you take your rights.
[00:36:47.904 --> 00:36:50.044]  First, you can protest in the daytime.
[00:36:50.064 --> 00:36:51.425]  Now you can't protest in the daytime.
[00:36:51.685 --> 00:36:52.965]  Then you can protest on the sidewalk.
[00:36:53.005 --> 00:36:54.346]  Now you can't protest on the sidewalk.
[00:36:54.626 --> 00:36:55.666]  Now you can protest over here.
[00:36:55.686 --> 00:36:56.686]  Now you can't stand over here.
[00:36:56.986 --> 00:36:58.407]  Now you gotta walk all the way down the street.
[00:37:01.207 --> 00:37:02.128]  Can I go back that way?
[00:37:03.408 --> 00:37:05.128]  Okay, so they're telling me I can't go back that way.
[00:37:05.609 --> 00:37:05.869]  Alright.
[00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:09.650]  I mean, for how long?
[00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:10.870]  When is the street gonna be open?
[00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.211]  I mean, when's it gonna- I mean, is it gonna be open tomorrow or what?
[00:37:20.799 --> 00:37:21.480]  What's your name, sir?
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.241]  I'll be happy to move.
[00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:22.781]  Tell me your name.
[00:37:24.503 --> 00:37:25.825]  Sir, sir, I'll be happy to leave.
[00:37:25.845 --> 00:37:26.485]  Just tell me your name.
[00:37:26.686 --> 00:37:27.547]  Just tell me your name, sir.
[00:37:29.113 --> 00:37:31.614]  Okay, so this officer is refusing to tell me his name.
[00:37:31.995 --> 00:37:34.296]  I told him I'd be happy to comply, but he won't tell me his name.
[00:37:34.736 --> 00:37:37.838]  And that's the kind of accountability that you get in Police State USA.
[00:37:38.038 --> 00:37:40.039]  Now, Joe Biggs, this officer just ordered me to move.
[00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:40.960]  I was going to be arrested.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.361]  I said, Officer, I'd be happy to move if you only tell me your name.
[00:37:43.962 --> 00:37:44.862]  And now they won't tell me my name.
[00:37:44.882 --> 00:37:45.542]  Or tell me his name.
[00:37:45.562 --> 00:37:46.163]  My car's over there!
[00:37:54.502 --> 00:37:55.462]  My car is over there.
[00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:56.683]  Alright, hands up, don't shoot.
[00:37:57.023 --> 00:37:57.543]  Alright.
[00:37:58.003 --> 00:37:58.584]  I'm going that way.
[00:37:58.604 --> 00:37:58.944]  Alright.
[00:37:59.364 --> 00:38:00.524]  Thank you, sir, for having a cool head.
[00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:01.245]  This guy's pushing me.
[00:38:01.285 --> 00:38:02.145]  Take your hands off me, sir.
[00:38:02.405 --> 00:38:03.306]  Take your hands off me, sir.
[00:38:03.346 --> 00:38:04.446]  I'll be happy to move.
[00:38:04.466 --> 00:38:06.447]  See, why do you guys keep talking?
[00:38:06.547 --> 00:38:07.387]  I'm walking this way.
[00:38:07.447 --> 00:38:09.188]  Walk in front of the police officer.
[00:38:09.688 --> 00:38:09.968]  Hey.
[00:38:12.769 --> 00:38:13.690]  Hey, hands up, don't shoot.
[00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:14.350]  Mind up.
[00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:14.770]  Alright.
[00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:15.631]  Get back to school.
[00:38:15.971 --> 00:38:18.792]  Alright, so this is what happens.
[00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:23.194]  Where do we have to go?
[00:38:23.214 --> 00:38:23.574]  To Canada?
[00:38:24.318 --> 00:38:25.138]  Golly, man.
[00:38:26.099 --> 00:38:27.500]  I gotta walk back to Austin now?
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.380]  I mean, what's the deal?
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.141]  I'm walking!
[00:38:30.861 --> 00:38:34.883]  You guys know your kids live here too, right?
[00:38:35.463 --> 00:38:40.846]  And then if your kids come out and protest for something they care about, then there's gonna be a bunch of people marching in down the street.
[00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:42.366]  I'm walking!
[00:38:42.406 --> 00:38:43.987]  I'm looking to be seen, man!
[00:38:44.688 --> 00:38:45.488]  I'm moving right now.
[00:38:45.848 --> 00:38:46.288]  Golly.
[00:38:55.964 --> 00:38:57.484]  So you see how these guys keep bullying you?
[00:38:58.024 --> 00:38:59.025]  This is how they just keep doing it.
[00:38:59.645 --> 00:39:04.686]  And once again, I understand that not every cop is bad, not every cop endorses this type of behavior.
[00:39:05.126 --> 00:39:07.767]  But you saw these guys, they're putting their hands on me, they're pushing me around.
[00:39:08.487 --> 00:39:12.148]  They got heavy armor, I'm not even armed.
[00:39:12.628 --> 00:39:14.328]  And this is how they do it.
[00:39:14.368 --> 00:39:15.609]  We are peaceful!
[00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:21.148]  These guys are cowards.
[00:39:21.508 --> 00:39:22.288]  This is ridiculous.
[00:39:22.308 --> 00:39:23.848]  Yeah, I do agree with that 100%.
[00:39:23.888 --> 00:39:24.489]  We got some cowards.
[00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:25.809]  It's not illegal to protest.
[00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:27.389]  They're inciting a riot.
[00:39:27.409 --> 00:39:31.210]  They want to stand out here and protest and then they should live.
[00:39:43.693 --> 00:39:47.214]  Oh, so Joe, they put us back in the same choke point.
[00:39:47.314 --> 00:39:51.235]  You see, this is the choke point that they had yesterday with the barricades on both sides.
[00:39:51.916 --> 00:39:53.416]  So they got exactly what they wanted.
[00:39:53.456 --> 00:39:55.337]  This is what the plan was the entire time.
[00:39:56.417 --> 00:39:58.198]  This is what the plan was the entire time.
[00:39:59.318 --> 00:40:00.779]  You must leave the roadway.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.560]  Take the roadway.
[00:40:05.221 --> 00:40:06.601]  It's not the proper option.
[00:40:07.561 --> 00:40:08.702]  You must leave the roadway.
[00:40:09.636 --> 00:40:10.597]  Yeah, we're out of the street.
[00:40:10.677 --> 00:40:12.019]  Yeah, we're out of the street.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:18.548]  Alright, so as you can see, myself, Joe Biggs, Staff Sergeant, all on the street, all on the sidewalk, around them.
[00:40:18.768 --> 00:40:21.131]  And you see there, there they are right there.
[00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:22.793]  Right there.
[00:40:33.727 --> 00:40:38.711]  Hey, that guy's aiming a gun at me.
[00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:46.396]  I don't know if that guy's aiming a gun at me, but it definitely looks like he's pretty close there.
[00:40:53.385 --> 00:40:57.368]  Look at the peaceful protesters, the majority of which are on the sidewalk.
[00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.990]  You've got a few guys standing in the streets, just barely in the streets.
[00:41:00.531 --> 00:41:02.192]  Now we're back at the exact same spot.
[00:41:02.232 --> 00:41:02.332]  Yeah.
[00:41:02.352 --> 00:41:04.554]  Don't throw items of any kind.
[00:41:04.814 --> 00:41:11.119]  Throwing items may result in arrest.
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:12.940]  Real tough guys.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.843]  May result in injury to unintended persons.
[00:41:15.883 --> 00:41:19.446]  Do not throw items of any kind.
[00:41:20.848 --> 00:41:22.209]  Nobody's throwing anything.
[00:41:22.249 --> 00:41:22.690]  Exactly.
[00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:23.991]  Look at the guy.
[00:41:24.752 --> 00:41:29.896]  Look at him.
[00:41:29.937 --> 00:41:31.798]  He got a good shot on him today.
[00:41:37.644 --> 00:41:39.025]  Can you stop aiming that thing, bro?
[00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:49.052]  They're good.
[00:41:49.112 --> 00:41:54.699]  They can't beat you.
[00:41:54.799 --> 00:41:58.904]  Ain't nobody better than you.
[00:41:59.064 --> 00:42:02.167]  Anybody can beat you.
[00:42:03.311 --> 00:42:04.311]  I gotta move again?
[00:42:04.532 --> 00:42:09.954]  Come on down.
[00:42:10.034 --> 00:42:12.935]  Okay, so this guy just walked up to him and said he's too close to him.
[00:42:12.975 --> 00:42:14.396]  What kind of sense does that make?
[00:42:14.876 --> 00:42:17.057]  Yo, this is a protest.
[00:42:17.197 --> 00:42:19.378]  It's not a legal protest.
[00:42:21.919 --> 00:42:23.519]  I'm not in the street.
[00:42:23.559 --> 00:42:25.360]  You shouldn't even be talking, bro.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.801]  That ain't your job to talk.
[00:42:27.761 --> 00:42:28.761]  You shouldn't even be talking.
[00:42:28.961 --> 00:42:29.882]  You already know that.
[00:42:35.844 --> 00:42:49.150]  Alright, here we are.
[00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.131]  Frontlines of the Info War.
[00:42:51.951 --> 00:42:54.052]  Joe Biggs, Josh Owens is standing right behind me.
[00:42:54.092 --> 00:42:55.313]  Josh is on the other side of the street.
[00:42:55.333 --> 00:42:57.874]  I don't know if my other lights are beaming him out, but there he is over there.
[00:42:58.354 --> 00:42:59.234]  There's Joe right there.
[00:42:59.254 --> 00:43:00.175]  Frontlines.
[00:43:01.889 --> 00:43:02.609]  And here we are.
[00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:09.793]  And I don't have anything against the police, but when I see police aim snipers at peaceful protesters, I don't understand why that has to happen.
[00:43:14.335 --> 00:43:14.996]  I'm sure they do.
[00:43:16.016 --> 00:43:16.596]  I'm sure they do.
[00:43:16.616 --> 00:43:17.757]  They get to play soldier boy.
[00:43:19.358 --> 00:43:23.160]  You can walk up to a black man and shoot him in his head like that?
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.720]  That's fucked up.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:25.861]  And real fucked up.
[00:43:27.182 --> 00:43:29.003]  Couldn't have been mine, though.
[00:43:29.023 --> 00:43:32.604]  Ferguson already knows Johnson don't play out here.
[00:43:32.684 --> 00:43:34.805]  Been out here since what?
[00:43:34.825 --> 00:43:35.425]  1967, goddamnit.
[00:43:35.445 --> 00:43:37.326]  Alright, more reports coming.
[00:43:37.826 --> 00:43:39.147]  InfoWars.com.
[00:43:39.807 --> 00:43:41.768]  Corey Jackson, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:42.028 --> 00:43:46.549]  Some moron decided to throw a bottle, and now the police are popping smoke.
[00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:50.431]  As you see, I had to rush to get my camera out, but this is the scene right now.
[00:43:52.807 --> 00:44:00.053]  So the police are out there popping smoke, and because, you know, just one guy, you know, you got a freaking army over here, but one guy... One guy threw a bottle.
[00:44:00.093 --> 00:44:02.095]  Yeah, and now... And now it's all hell, basically.
[00:44:02.115 --> 00:44:03.456]  Yo, you can't have a First Amendment.
[00:44:03.537 --> 00:44:07.480]  Instead of coming back here and trying to get that one guy, you know, nobody can be out here.
[00:44:08.081 --> 00:44:09.982]  So... You must disperse immediately.
[00:44:10.623 --> 00:44:12.344]  The long, hard cock of the law.
[00:44:12.544 --> 00:44:12.845]  Yeah.
[00:44:12.865 --> 00:44:14.746]  So this is the situation out here.
[00:44:15.467 --> 00:44:21.872]  Like I said, a largely peaceful crowd of 99.9% of people are peaceful.
[00:44:22.392 --> 00:44:27.556]  But because one dude decides to throw something, now they have a reason to end everybody's First Amendment.
[00:44:27.576 --> 00:44:28.937]  They haven't broke the line at least.
[00:44:29.517 --> 00:44:31.839]  They've dispersed our protest effectively now.
[00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:33.680]  With four cans of smoke.
[00:44:36.786 --> 00:44:38.047]  At least it hasn't gotten violent yet.
[00:44:38.287 --> 00:44:40.429]  That's good.
[00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:45.252]  Yeah, we had to move back, but it's a shame.
[00:44:46.413 --> 00:44:47.734]  So now they're going to put it out.
[00:44:47.854 --> 00:44:52.397]  They're going to say, well, you see, because one guy threw a bottle, that's why you can't have people peacefully protest.
[00:44:53.037 --> 00:44:54.178]  I mean, like, you got a freaking arm.
[00:44:54.278 --> 00:44:55.699]  I mean, can you get that one guy?
[00:44:55.739 --> 00:44:56.920]  I mean, if it's that big of an issue.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.282]  That one guy, that's not my constitutional rights.
[00:44:59.362 --> 00:45:00.523]  It should be taken away.
[00:45:00.583 --> 00:45:00.783]  Yeah.
[00:45:01.944 --> 00:45:03.765]  All right, so we'll see what the vows.
[00:45:03.805 --> 00:45:05.086]  Right now they are holding the line.
[00:45:05.106 --> 00:45:06.067]  They are staying back there.
[00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:10.101]  So we'll see what develops here, coming up soon.
[00:45:10.382 --> 00:45:12.164]  More reports, InfoWars.com.
[00:45:12.945 --> 00:45:17.551]  Live from Ferguson, Missouri, getting little parts out here.
[00:45:17.571 --> 00:45:21.236]  We've been out here for a long time, but you see people have moved back.
[00:45:21.997 --> 00:45:23.237]  So stay tuned for more reports.
[00:45:23.317 --> 00:45:25.438]  You must leave the entire area.
[00:45:25.778 --> 00:45:27.778]  Oh, now I got to leave the entire area?
[00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:29.138]  Fuck you.
[00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:32.339]  The peaceful assembly is no longer peaceful.
[00:45:32.879 --> 00:45:37.480]  You must return to your vehicles or return to your homes.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.301]  So there you go again, the curfew.
[00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:41.021]  You got to go home, right?
[00:45:41.121 --> 00:45:42.221]  Subject to arrest.
[00:45:42.561 --> 00:45:44.182]  You must leave the area.
[00:45:45.062 --> 00:45:48.442]  So, so a block away because one guy threw a bottle.
[00:45:49.023 --> 00:45:50.723]  Now we can't have a First Amendment.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.641]  And these guys are throwing tear gas.
[00:45:56.201 --> 00:45:59.083]  You will be subject to arrest if you fail to comply.
[00:46:00.864 --> 00:46:03.985]  And you will have a constitutional case on your hands!
[00:46:04.265 --> 00:46:07.647]  I mean, how can they feel threatened when you're... Look how far we are from them.
[00:46:07.687 --> 00:46:10.429]  Look, here are my feet, here's this guy's feet I've been talking to.
[00:46:10.449 --> 00:46:11.249]  We're good 200 feet away.
[00:46:11.409 --> 00:46:15.371]  Yeah, and the guy said we walked a block away, and I mean, or a block away from these guys.
[00:46:15.712 --> 00:46:19.554]  Now this is a completely constitution-free zone because one guy threw a bottle.
[00:46:20.294 --> 00:46:20.594]  One person.
[00:46:20.814 --> 00:46:21.154]  One person.
[00:46:21.474 --> 00:46:21.835]  One person.
[00:46:22.455 --> 00:46:23.875]  And that's how it happens.
[00:46:24.395 --> 00:46:26.616]  They have a complete army back there.
[00:46:26.956 --> 00:46:28.237]  And you say, what do you mean army?
[00:46:28.417 --> 00:46:31.117]  We counted before, they have at least 70 guys in heavy armor.
[00:46:31.798 --> 00:46:34.258]  I mean, that's a pretty good invasion force.
[00:46:34.278 --> 00:46:38.360]  Some of the guys, they seem to go get Bin Laden, if you believe everything about that story, but that's a whole other issue.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.100]  So, yeah.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.221]  That's what happened.
[00:46:42.821 --> 00:46:44.562]  And here come some people, peaceful people.
[00:46:45.182 --> 00:46:47.683]  They're just trying to get out the Constitution Free Zone.
[00:46:52.037 --> 00:46:53.998]  Yeah, just some journalists.
[00:46:54.298 --> 00:46:55.098]  They had to get their gear.
[00:47:00.179 --> 00:47:02.340]  Yeah.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.901]  Yeah, pretty much.
[00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:13.062]  So yeah, just like the guy said, you know, we're still here, but a lot of the media is falling even further back.
[00:47:13.342 --> 00:47:16.603]  So I would not be surprised at all if these guys start advancing at this point.
[00:47:17.441 --> 00:47:20.424]  You must return to your vehicles or return to your homes.
[00:47:20.864 --> 00:47:23.467]  You may no longer be in the area.
[00:47:23.927 --> 00:47:24.428]  Why not?
[00:47:24.448 --> 00:47:26.270]  It is no longer a peaceful protest.
[00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.251]  Yes it is!
[00:47:27.331 --> 00:47:28.952]  You are not peacefully assembling.
[00:47:29.132 --> 00:47:29.673]  Yes I am!
[00:47:29.853 --> 00:47:31.995]  Oh my god, any excuse bro?
[00:47:32.215 --> 00:47:32.776]  Any excuse?
[00:47:32.796 --> 00:47:34.237]  I am peacefully protesting!
[00:47:34.257 --> 00:47:37.020]  You must leave the area immediately.
[00:47:37.601 --> 00:47:39.943]  Return to your vehicles, return to your homes.
[00:47:41.044 --> 00:47:41.805]  Better to do so
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.121]  We'll subject you to arrest.
[00:47:44.601 --> 00:47:45.602]  I hope it's worth it!
[00:47:45.682 --> 00:47:48.203]  You must leave the area immediately.
[00:47:49.264 --> 00:47:51.245]  So this is pretty much, I guess, the front line now.
[00:47:51.305 --> 00:47:52.285]  Me and my guy over here.
[00:47:52.565 --> 00:47:54.106]  The Infant Wars crew is close behind.
[00:47:54.526 --> 00:47:57.188]  But yeah, we're right up here, still on the front lines.
[00:47:58.476 --> 00:48:00.679]  They're back there, the crew's back there getting a few interviews.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.465]  But yeah, they're trying to find out what's going on, how people feel about one guy.
[00:48:04.966 --> 00:48:05.527]  Just one guy.
[00:48:05.627 --> 00:48:09.993]  I mean, you got 70 plus guys, heavy armor, snipers on the hoods.
[00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:14.120]  And now our peaceful protest is gone.
[00:48:15.367 --> 00:48:17.849]  And as I said last night, they told people to go home.
[00:48:18.149 --> 00:48:19.670]  In my mind, that's instituting a curfew.
[00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:20.410]  That's what it is.
[00:48:20.871 --> 00:48:23.132]  Oh yeah, the chief of police said, there is no curfew tonight.
[00:48:23.412 --> 00:48:26.915]  And then we heard him say, return to your homes or you will be subject to arrest.
[00:48:26.935 --> 00:48:27.395]  Multiple times.
[00:48:27.415 --> 00:48:29.557]  So those are pretty contradictory statements.
[00:48:29.677 --> 00:48:29.977]  Right.
[00:48:30.037 --> 00:48:31.658]  And he's not saying it like a suggestion.
[00:48:31.718 --> 00:48:32.278]  Right.
[00:48:32.479 --> 00:48:33.099]  It's forceful.
[00:48:33.139 --> 00:48:33.599]  Yeah.
[00:48:33.619 --> 00:48:33.819]  Okay.
[00:48:33.939 --> 00:48:35.781]  Alright, so I'm glad I'm not the only one.
[00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:37.062]  This is our third warning though, right?
[00:48:38.823 --> 00:48:39.343]  Yes, we are!
[00:48:39.363 --> 00:48:40.464]  My hands are up, officer!
[00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:43.647]  We are peaceably assembling!
[00:48:44.127 --> 00:48:47.389]  Failure to do so will subject you to arrest.
[00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.471]  Leave the area immediately.
[00:48:50.892 --> 00:48:53.514]  Okay, we look pretty peaceful, me and my boy here.
[00:48:53.534 --> 00:48:54.314]  We got our arms up.
[00:48:54.695 --> 00:48:55.515]  Hands up, don't shoot.
[00:48:56.056 --> 00:48:56.796]  Hands up, don't shoot.
[00:48:56.916 --> 00:48:57.537]  I got mine up here.
[00:48:57.557 --> 00:48:58.437]  Yes, we are!
[00:48:58.457 --> 00:48:59.438]  Return to your vehicles.
[00:48:59.798 --> 00:49:00.719]  Return to your homes.
[00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:06.550]  Oh my gosh.
[00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:07.951]  So this is how it happens.
[00:49:08.351 --> 00:49:11.613]  This is exactly how it happens in the United States of America.
[00:49:11.633 --> 00:49:18.578]  I mean, you know, when, when an officer killed somebody, you know, that, you know, that's okay.
[00:49:18.618 --> 00:49:19.159]  It's not a big deal.
[00:49:19.379 --> 00:49:22.621]  Oh, somebody, oh man, somebody's throwing a freaking cocktail over there.
[00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:23.222]  Golly.
[00:49:23.502 --> 00:49:24.483]  Bro, come on.
[00:49:24.583 --> 00:49:25.123]  Don't do that.
[00:49:26.644 --> 00:49:27.685]  Golly, man.
[00:49:27.705 --> 00:49:29.066]  All right.
[00:49:29.146 --> 00:49:33.869]  So some guy just threw a, you know, one of those flaming cocktails, Molotov, and, uh,
[00:49:35.885 --> 00:49:37.267]  Yeah, okay, so we got two people.
[00:49:37.567 --> 00:49:39.169]  Two people out of hundreds.
[00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:43.613]  And they could have caught that guy if they weren't so scared to step away from their line.
[00:49:43.633 --> 00:49:45.936]  Did you see safety in the monster reacts?
[00:49:46.677 --> 00:49:48.739]  I saw somebody throw a glass bottle.
[00:49:49.239 --> 00:49:53.244]  I'm not sure if that's what the original deal was, but I saw a glass bottle fly off my head and land on the ground.
[00:49:54.344 --> 00:49:55.765]  And I don't even think it got close.
[00:49:55.825 --> 00:49:57.266]  It was within the 25 feet.
[00:49:57.286 --> 00:49:58.607]  It didn't even get closer than that.
[00:49:59.127 --> 00:50:00.308]  But yeah, that's the deal.
[00:50:00.848 --> 00:50:03.110]  And some guys back there running off to throw him in a cocktail.
[00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.251]  Like I said, if they wanted to, they got the numbers.
[00:50:05.271 --> 00:50:06.412]  They could have easily caught the guy.
[00:50:06.692 --> 00:50:07.613]  But that's not a priority.
[00:50:08.173 --> 00:50:09.274]  That's not a priority.
[00:50:09.634 --> 00:50:13.937]  Just, you know, crushing the free spirit out here.
[00:50:15.339 --> 00:50:16.639]  Boys, I would not recommend that.
[00:50:17.319 --> 00:50:19.440]  So these guys are inching up here.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.901]  I'm not sure what these guys are up to.
[00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:25.401]  He's looking for something.
[00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:27.662]  He maybe dropped a phone or something, this guy over here.
[00:50:27.682 --> 00:50:28.222]  I don't know.
[00:50:39.316 --> 00:50:40.777]  Yeah, somebody threw a glass bottle.
[00:50:41.077 --> 00:50:45.402]  I don't know if that was the initial thing thrown, because I was like looking at my phone, and then everybody started running.
[00:50:45.422 --> 00:50:46.302]  I was like, where is everybody running?
[00:50:46.322 --> 00:50:47.924]  Then I saw the glass bottle come and crack.
[00:50:48.344 --> 00:50:50.487]  That's when they popped the smoke that I saw.
[00:50:50.847 --> 00:50:51.528]  And I was on the front line.
[00:50:51.588 --> 00:50:53.369]  I was like on the front line with this dude up here.
[00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.892]  So yeah, that's how it went down.
[00:50:59.602 --> 00:51:04.585]  So we had one guy throw a bottle, at least one guy, and then some other guy over here in the bushes or whatever threw a molotov.
[00:51:05.305 --> 00:51:06.586]  It didn't get anywhere close to him.
[00:51:07.146 --> 00:51:09.087]  I mean, he was running right through this field over here.
[00:51:09.107 --> 00:51:10.568]  Somebody threw a molotov.
[00:51:10.588 --> 00:51:11.568]  Where's the fire?
[00:51:11.908 --> 00:51:12.649]  There is no fire.
[00:51:13.009 --> 00:51:16.571]  It hit the ground, I guess it hit the gravel over there, and it went out.
[00:51:17.251 --> 00:51:18.251]  And like I said, they got the numbers.
[00:51:18.271 --> 00:51:22.334]  They could have easily caught the guy if they weren't scared to step out of their alignment.
[00:51:22.554 --> 00:51:23.614]  But that's not an issue for them.
[00:51:24.935 --> 00:51:26.656]  Alright, so more reports, info at wars.com.
[00:51:28.416 --> 00:51:35.040]  Alex Jones here to break down some exciting developments in the area of research concerning supplemental iodine.
[00:51:35.701 --> 00:51:37.862]  It's nothing less than phenomenal.
[00:51:38.422 --> 00:51:44.706]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:51:44.966 --> 00:51:48.949]  And I used some of the mainline iodine supplements and they upset my stomach and I had some issues with it.
[00:51:49.429 --> 00:51:59.713]  Until I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, who I was already interviewing as an expert on my radio show, and I began taking the product before he actually rolled it out.
[00:52:00.173 --> 00:52:05.475]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:52:06.215 --> 00:52:14.018]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.689]  That's right.
[00:52:34.458 --> 00:52:56.803]  Pure iodine and the results that I personally have had have been life-changing I was over 270 pounds and with the iodine exercise and Better diet I have lost now more than 50 pounds total and I'm in continuing to lose the way I have more energy my libido all this crap came out of my skin and
[00:52:57.283 --> 00:52:58.764]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:52:58.784 --> 00:53:00.144]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:53:00.424 --> 00:53:01.565]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:53:02.105 --> 00:53:06.866]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:07.206 --> 00:53:08.067]  This is innovating.
[00:53:08.487 --> 00:53:09.487]  This is trailblazing.
[00:53:09.927 --> 00:53:17.230]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[00:54:52.267 --> 00:54:59.973]  For in its power to deceive and inflame, or enlighten and inspire, the motion picture has no equal.
[00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:11.593]  Welcome back to this live special edition of the Nightly News.
[00:55:11.653 --> 00:55:28.207]  I'm David Knight here with Leanne McAdoo and what you were just watching before the Big Brother episode there, actually I guess we could say that that's part of it, but what you were watching just before that was a collection of clips of events that happened yesterday and last night because of course everything
[00:55:28.848 --> 00:55:30.289]  Spun out of control last night.
[00:55:30.369 --> 00:55:37.213]  The police in Ferguson, Missouri came after journalists, shooting them with tear gas, shooting rubber bullets at them.
[00:55:37.273 --> 00:55:39.875]  One of our reporters, Joe Biggs, was shot with a rubber bullet.
[00:55:40.115 --> 00:55:41.055]  It left a lot of damage.
[00:55:41.095 --> 00:55:46.038]  Actually, he showed pictures of signs that had been shot and holes in these signs.
[00:55:46.118 --> 00:55:48.680]  Those things are not really non-lethal.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.422]  People have died from being hit by rubber bullets.
[00:55:52.122 --> 00:55:53.163]  We shouldn't take that lightly.
[00:55:53.203 --> 00:56:03.291]  We saw pictures of police who were pointing weapons at people in the crowd and, of course, the dogs that this former police chief from Seattle had talked about.
[00:56:03.311 --> 00:56:12.259]  He said dogs have no place in a situation where there is a peaceful assembly or it's a civil rights demonstration or whatever.
[00:56:12.299 --> 00:56:19.185]  Going back, say, we should have learned that lesson back in the 60s when we mistakenly turned the dogs on civil rights protesters.
[00:56:19.625 --> 00:56:21.786]  We've got Jakari Jackson is going to be joining us.
[00:56:21.886 --> 00:56:23.327]  I think, do we have him ready right now, guys?
[00:56:24.228 --> 00:56:24.508]  Okay.
[00:56:24.808 --> 00:56:25.789]  Let's go to Jakari.
[00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:41.097]  I want to get an update as to what's going on there and find out how things have changed because we've heard that there's been some changes, not only in the fact that the police have been relieved of direct duty, essentially, putting the highway patrol, the governor's put the highway patrol in charge of that.
[00:56:41.137 --> 00:56:45.700]  We've also heard reports that perhaps the FBI may be put in charge of the investigation.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.121]  Jakari, what's going on there now?
[00:56:48.291 --> 00:56:52.573]  Well, this is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com reporting from Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:56:52.593 --> 00:56:57.355]  Let's take a quick look, because this has been going on for the past couple of hours.
[00:56:57.756 --> 00:57:01.077]  This is a conservative 2,000 people you can't really see.
[00:57:01.097 --> 00:57:02.478]  Hey, look, let's see.
[00:57:02.498 --> 00:57:04.219]  Do you have something you want to say, miss?
[00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:05.540]  Yes, I do.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.421]  I think we all should come together regardless of our color.
[00:57:08.922 --> 00:57:12.763]  This is not just about Mike Brown, it's about other people across the nation getting murdered.
[00:57:12.923 --> 00:57:19.886]  I just watched a man get choked out over an altercation that was very disturbing to see, but our police should protect and serve, not murder and disturb.
[00:57:20.206 --> 00:57:25.028]  They're here to protect us and they never do, seldom do, and I don't meet really nice cops in St.
[00:57:25.068 --> 00:57:30.210]  Louis, but I've been harassed before and almost slammed on the ground by a man for no reason.
[00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:32.731]  They had no description of the person.
[00:57:32.751 --> 00:57:36.712]  They said it was me, that's her, that's her, finna take me to jail, and I think we should all just
[00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:37.831]  Watch out for each other.
[00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:39.232]  We should watch out for each other.
[00:57:39.252 --> 00:57:40.774]  Now, I don't know, were you here last night?
[00:57:40.854 --> 00:57:41.735]  No, I wasn't.
[00:57:41.755 --> 00:57:44.417]  Okay, now, I would say that, you were here?
[00:57:44.437 --> 00:57:45.198]  Come here, come here.
[00:57:45.218 --> 00:57:46.099]  Come here, come here.
[00:57:46.159 --> 00:57:46.660]  Come on, come on.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.781]  Everybody, let's get it.
[00:57:48.021 --> 00:57:50.103]  Okay, so what do you think about the police response?
[00:57:50.643 --> 00:57:53.066]  Yeah, what do you think about the police response last night compared to today?
[00:57:53.655 --> 00:57:56.377]  It was absolutely ridiculous.
[00:57:56.477 --> 00:57:57.518]  Today is different.
[00:57:57.558 --> 00:57:58.960]  They're mixed in with the crowd.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.422]  Um, last night they were in tactical.
[00:58:01.522 --> 00:58:04.164]  I mean, they even had on these masks, these black masks.
[00:58:04.184 --> 00:58:12.151]  Some of them were in plain clothes and they would jump into the crowd and they would not identify themselves.
[00:58:12.551 --> 00:58:14.693]  Then they would go back up behind the regular cops.
[00:58:14.773 --> 00:58:18.536]  And I got pictures and raw footage to prove that the people,
[00:58:20.738 --> 00:58:22.219]  We're having a peaceful protest.
[00:58:22.239 --> 00:58:23.839]  The young people were not out here clowning.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.440]  I came out here purposely at night.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.943]  What happened with that lie that they told, saying that people were throwing bottles and rocks and all that?
[00:58:32.583 --> 00:58:33.644]  Here's the people.
[00:58:33.884 --> 00:58:34.724]  Here's the police.
[00:58:35.024 --> 00:58:36.025]  The media's right here.
[00:58:36.325 --> 00:58:36.945]  That's this room.
[00:58:37.025 --> 00:58:37.845]  Everybody can see.
[00:58:38.466 --> 00:58:40.266]  Where are the bottles and the rocks?
[00:58:40.346 --> 00:58:41.187]  Where did that happen at?
[00:58:41.207 --> 00:58:42.787]  Now, one person did throw a bottle.
[00:58:42.867 --> 00:58:48.990]  It went over my head and busted right in front of me when I was sitting there in front of the tactical vehicle on the left.
[00:58:49.434 --> 00:58:56.518]  But I will tell you, I will tell you though, the one bottle, they had 70 plus guys in heavy armor.
[00:58:56.538 --> 00:58:59.859]  They could have caught that one guy if they wanted to.
[00:58:59.999 --> 00:59:07.743]  It's a big change from every night, from tonight, because every night since Sunday, man, the police, it was a heavy presence, you know?
[00:59:07.863 --> 00:59:12.386]  And tonight, the cops is non-existent and there's still no violence.
[00:59:12.466 --> 00:59:15.067]  That's all we wanted, man, just to hear our voice.
[00:59:15.127 --> 00:59:16.068]  We didn't need all that.
[00:59:16.108 --> 00:59:17.088]  I mean, but they scattered.
[00:59:17.108 --> 00:59:18.229]  But when we was out here before,
[00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:21.450]  They snipers, they got the beams on us and everything.
[00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:23.930]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:25.971]  And it makes big tension, you know what I'm saying?
[00:59:25.991 --> 00:59:27.551]  So you can't tell us to go nowhere.
[00:59:27.591 --> 00:59:41.995]  When you're laughing at you, when you're talking about Mike and how he was executed or murdered or however people want to look at it, and we're talking about it and people are on the loudspeaker expressing themselves, and you're sitting there hitting your baton and laughing at them and taunting them.
[00:59:42.055 --> 00:59:46.536]  We saw Joe Berrics tell them the story about the guy who was laughing and giggling.
[00:59:47.056 --> 01:00:11.094]  On the far left side where the riot vehicle was and the cop had the baton and he kept doing this and he had this sick like smile on his face and he just kept looking and people were walking up and say hey you need to act professional you're here to do a job to protect and serve not intimidate people stop pointing guns at people and stop the intimidation let me ask you let me ask you this I'll let you talk in one second let me ask you guys this what do you think about the response from the black leaders what do you think about President Obama's response to this?
[01:00:11.434 --> 01:00:12.574]  Excellent, excellent.
[01:00:13.095 --> 01:00:16.536]  I like the fact that he did something behind the scenes before he even spoke.
[01:00:16.716 --> 01:00:17.596]  What did he do behind the scenes?
[01:00:17.896 --> 01:00:19.217]  Well, he got the U.S.
[01:00:19.257 --> 01:00:21.017]  Department of Justice involved, U.S.
[01:00:21.057 --> 01:00:21.858]  District Attorney.
[01:00:22.198 --> 01:00:23.938]  He did all that before he even spoke.
[01:00:24.399 --> 01:00:26.919]  Al Sharpton, I got an issue with.
[01:00:26.959 --> 01:00:29.260]  What do you got an issue with Al Sharpton?
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:34.322]  Al Sharpton came in town, got in front of the cameras, picked up a microphone,
[01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:40.527]  Say his thing in front of the cameras, then left us, went to the Wiz Khalifa, Young Jeezy concert.
[01:00:40.787 --> 01:00:41.608]  Took pictures.
[01:00:41.628 --> 01:00:42.169]  Is that true?
[01:00:42.429 --> 01:00:44.952]  Yeah, took pictures with him and Amber Rose, man.
[01:00:44.992 --> 01:00:46.493]  You tell me how y'all was hanging out with Young Jeezy.
[01:00:46.513 --> 01:00:48.415]  I saw it on Instagram.
[01:00:48.635 --> 01:00:51.278]  He did not meet with none of the protesters.
[01:00:51.338 --> 01:00:51.679]  I mean...
[01:00:52.424 --> 01:00:54.265]  It took a while for them to come in, though.
[01:00:54.425 --> 01:00:54.925]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:00:54.945 --> 01:00:56.045]  We've been out here every night.
[01:00:56.365 --> 01:00:58.266]  But that's what all this is for, man.
[01:00:58.326 --> 01:00:59.966]  It took a while for them to get out here.
[01:00:59.986 --> 01:01:01.027]  We've been out here every night.
[01:01:01.127 --> 01:01:02.507]  Obama, what took you so long?
[01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:04.248]  This is a crisis out here, man.
[01:01:04.508 --> 01:01:05.088]  This is a crisis.
[01:01:05.148 --> 01:01:06.408]  And about Al Sharpton.
[01:01:06.748 --> 01:01:07.329]  Come on, man.
[01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:10.349]  Can we trust a government informant?
[01:01:10.389 --> 01:01:11.510]  Can we trust that?
[01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:12.070]  Thank you, sir.
[01:01:12.338 --> 01:01:15.562]  Well, I like to say that I believe the President did the right thing.
[01:01:15.902 --> 01:01:18.825]  I'm not going to criticize him for nothing, for what he did.
[01:01:19.146 --> 01:01:19.826]  I got his back 100%.
[01:01:20.127 --> 01:01:22.169]  He got the police.
[01:01:22.369 --> 01:01:24.652]  Do you see snipers out here anymore?
[01:01:24.692 --> 01:01:25.052]  Not today.
[01:01:25.092 --> 01:01:26.274]  Do you see any tanks out here?
[01:01:26.414 --> 01:01:26.714]  Not today.
[01:01:26.734 --> 01:01:28.116]  How we been here with each other, guys?
[01:01:28.536 --> 01:01:34.880]  Because the boss man spoke, and he said what he said, and he already got people down here.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.962]  He said they're supposed to get back with him in a couple of days.
[01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:43.985]  And he also said he wants them to release the name of that police officer that killed Michael Brown.
[01:01:44.165 --> 01:01:44.706]  I agree with that.
[01:01:44.786 --> 01:01:45.226]  I agree.
[01:01:45.246 --> 01:01:47.027]  The police are much better behaved today.
[01:01:47.047 --> 01:01:48.908]  Now, Mitch, you had a statement you wanted to make.
[01:01:49.178 --> 01:01:55.961]  Well, no, I just wanted to talk about last night when they bombed everybody and shot at everybody.
[01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:57.261]  There were babies out there.
[01:01:57.301 --> 01:01:58.942]  That's what people are missing and forgetting.
[01:01:59.122 --> 01:02:05.404]  There are little children out there, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years old, and the police knew that.
[01:02:05.564 --> 01:02:11.146]  They were out there, they were out in front, and they're shooting and they're throwing tear gas at the children.
[01:02:11.326 --> 01:02:12.987]  That's the problem that I have with the police.
[01:02:15.288 --> 01:02:24.731]  I was an hour late for work because I woke up and I was completely dizzy.
[01:02:24.971 --> 01:02:25.632]  So he's right.
[01:02:25.872 --> 01:02:29.513]  We don't know what they had in those, uh, all that smoke that was going up.
[01:02:29.773 --> 01:02:33.814]  Someone else I talked to woke up, who was out there, woke up sick this morning.
[01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:35.274]  How many other countless people?
[01:02:35.314 --> 01:02:41.236]  However, I want to make the point, as much as they bomb us, as much as they shoot at us, it's not going to stop us.
[01:02:41.276 --> 01:02:53.219]  It's going to make us more determined than ever to get out here and get justice because there's a very serious situation going on here and we will no longer be intimidated by the police brutality.
[01:02:53.619 --> 01:02:55.719]  Was anybody here hit with a rubber bullet?
[01:02:56.559 --> 01:02:57.520]  Was anybody here gassed?
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:58.600]  You were gassed?
[01:03:00.004 --> 01:03:04.826]  Um, when I got hit with the gas, I didn't know what happened.
[01:03:04.846 --> 01:03:13.049]  I immediately got dizzy, my eyes were burning, he's dragging me, we're running, and I'm trying to still record and film it because I wanted to show what was going on.
[01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:19.331]  And when I got home, I took Benadryl, I take this stuff called silver, and social media, y'all know what I'm talking about.
[01:03:19.371 --> 01:03:20.051]  I know about the silver.
[01:03:20.332 --> 01:03:21.512]  I took some silver drops,
[01:03:21.992 --> 01:03:24.853]  And I went to bed and I woke up and I still have a headache.
[01:03:25.073 --> 01:03:27.234]  So I want to hit one of those canisters personally.
[01:03:27.294 --> 01:03:28.355]  Has anybody got one?
[01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:36.298]  Get it to me and I'll pay for a laboratory to go ahead, an independent laboratory to test it to see what chemicals were in there because you don't know what was in that stuff.
[01:03:36.318 --> 01:03:38.459]  I may take that Pepsi challenge.
[01:03:38.479 --> 01:03:43.722]  We got a canister of it and you can get you some silver, the silver bullet at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:03:43.762 --> 01:03:44.982]  Anybody else got a comment?
[01:03:45.002 --> 01:03:45.402]  Come on.
[01:03:45.602 --> 01:03:48.424]  I'd just like to say that this has been an ongoing process.
[01:03:48.844 --> 01:03:51.245]  Nixon today, I listened to him give his commentary earlier.
[01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:56.872]  And what he was saying, he pretty much tried to downplay the fact that the situation that has been going on in St.
[01:03:56.892 --> 01:03:58.373]  Louis all this entire time.
[01:03:58.393 --> 01:04:01.194]  The reason why I brought myself down here today, I was trying to be calm.
[01:04:01.614 --> 01:04:02.594]  It was so much going on.
[01:04:02.854 --> 01:04:05.575]  And I decided to come down here today because it dawned on me, like, St.
[01:04:05.595 --> 01:04:06.075]  Louis City?
[01:04:06.456 --> 01:04:12.918]  And I'm like, as in Moline Acres, as in Delwood, as in Jennings, as in Ferguson, as in Olivet, as in...
[01:04:13.467 --> 01:04:14.227]  I mean, you name it.
[01:04:14.247 --> 01:04:14.447]  St.
[01:04:14.467 --> 01:04:14.967]  Louis, St.
[01:04:14.987 --> 01:04:15.448]  Louis County.
[01:04:15.488 --> 01:04:16.088]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:04:16.148 --> 01:04:16.288]  St.
[01:04:16.308 --> 01:04:23.070]  Louis County has been like consistently making revenue off of flagging and pulling over black people consistently.
[01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:28.071]  The same people that put the money into their neighborhoods or the same people that they're taking in.
[01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:28.671]  You go to court.
[01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:31.632]  Like I heard a guy say earlier, he was the only white guy in court.
[01:04:31.692 --> 01:04:32.612]  Oh, I see it all the time.
[01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:33.573]  You go to Jennings.
[01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:36.353]  This is a predominantly black area, but white people pass through.
[01:04:36.453 --> 01:04:41.335]  Majority of it is traffic tickets, petty stuff, you know, but it's like the whole entire court, you'll see three people.
[01:04:41.375 --> 01:04:42.195]  And I've been studying this.
[01:04:42.555 --> 01:04:47.780]  Ever since I paid attention to LADU after their racial profiling case, I think back in the early 2000s.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.841]  So this is an ongoing process.
[01:04:49.861 --> 01:04:54.205]  This is the filter of rage from like years and years and years and years and years and years.
[01:04:54.505 --> 01:04:56.427]  As long as I've been driving, I'm desperate.
[01:04:56.447 --> 01:04:57.167]  You've seen a lot of it.
[01:04:57.187 --> 01:04:57.848]  You've seen a lot of it.
[01:04:57.868 --> 01:05:00.150]  Now let me let me ask you this, and I'm gonna let you ladies go.
[01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:02.592]  I see a lot of people of all types of races here.
[01:05:02.612 --> 01:05:04.454]  We got black, we got white, we got Hispanic.
[01:05:04.494 --> 01:05:08.637]  How do you feel about the support you're getting from outside the African-American?
[01:05:08.677 --> 01:05:09.818]  I don't expect anything but the
[01:05:10.259 --> 01:05:12.202]  But anything but what I've seen so far.
[01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:16.167]  I mean, everybody isn't just idiots, you know?
[01:05:16.207 --> 01:05:26.720]  So we got plenty of people here, and I interact with a lot of different people a lot of the time, and I see that there's a big difference between people on the ground and people somewhere else in, like, La La Land watching, like, Fox News or something.
[01:05:27.068 --> 01:05:32.009]  It's totally different on the ground and what it is, and the people that no matter what race you are, they look just like me.
[01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:35.250]  Feel the exact same way that I do about them, you know?
[01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:36.991]  So they'll ride for me just like I'll ride for them.
[01:05:37.011 --> 01:05:39.392]  So you guys all support everybody coming out here, all the colors?
[01:05:39.612 --> 01:05:41.172]  Well, it's about us all.
[01:05:41.192 --> 01:05:42.092]  We're all human beings.
[01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.253]  We're all God's children.
[01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.393]  We should all look out for each other no matter what race.
[01:05:45.753 --> 01:05:46.514]  It doesn't matter.
[01:05:46.554 --> 01:05:47.974]  So we're living in this earth together.
[01:05:48.014 --> 01:05:50.115]  We gotta protect your children because they are the future.
[01:05:50.135 --> 01:05:55.056]  What are we gonna have left if all our 17-year-old, 18-year-old kids are dead on the street with no future, no college?
[01:05:55.956 --> 01:05:56.636]  What are we going to do?
[01:05:56.716 --> 01:05:58.157]  So everybody should support St.
[01:05:58.177 --> 01:05:59.377]  Louis, but it happens every day.
[01:05:59.397 --> 01:06:03.198]  So we should support every city that they're happening and just keep going and support.
[01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:04.639]  We appreciate it.
[01:06:04.659 --> 01:06:05.179]  Thank you, ladies.
[01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:06.139]  And that's what it is.
[01:06:06.199 --> 01:06:07.040]  It's not about black.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:07.820]  It's not about white.
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:08.140]  Thank you.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:09.701]  It's not about young.
[01:06:09.741 --> 01:06:10.561]  It's not about old.
[01:06:10.961 --> 01:06:14.042]  People of all colors, races, ages come out here and that's what it is.
[01:06:14.082 --> 01:06:15.262]  This is a community issue.
[01:06:15.483 --> 01:06:16.783]  It's not us versus them.
[01:06:17.202 --> 01:06:18.283]  Everybody wants to come together.
[01:06:18.563 --> 01:06:20.384]  Nobody wants to see any more police brutality.
[01:06:20.424 --> 01:06:22.145]  Nobody wants to see any more looters.
[01:06:22.385 --> 01:06:26.528]  Nobody wants to see any more restaurants or other establishments burned to the ground.
[01:06:26.808 --> 01:06:27.709]  Nobody wants that here.
[01:06:27.889 --> 01:06:34.013]  You know, maybe they had some dissenting issues in the past, but these people here, they're peaceful and they want a peaceful resolution, David.
[01:06:35.287 --> 01:06:41.552]  Yeah, Jakari, I wanted to ask you quickly about the, uh, one of the people that you talked to said that there were some plainclothes people there.
[01:06:41.592 --> 01:06:49.778]  They called them, uh, well, they didn't call them agent provocateurs, but it certainly sounded like they were, saying that they were slipping into the crowd and, uh, doing things and then slipping back out.
[01:06:49.878 --> 01:06:50.919]  Did you see something like that?
[01:06:51.239 --> 01:06:57.264]  I personally have not seen anybody, um, who I would call a provocateur, not a, at least not an agent provocateur.
[01:06:57.504 --> 01:07:04.249]  You definitely have the hotheads who are out here, uh, being a little more rowdy than necessary, the people who throw the bottles and so forth.
[01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:07.617]  And I have heard the rumors there are some feds slipping in and out.
[01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:08.498]  I can't confirm that.
[01:07:08.819 --> 01:07:10.540]  I definitely would not be surprised if it was.
[01:07:10.881 --> 01:07:15.706]  And to answer your question, David, I would not be surprised if there were some professional provocateurs out here today.
[01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:21.891]  Well, you're doing a great job out there, Jakari.
[01:07:22.631 --> 01:07:26.352]  Obviously, we saw the situation escalate so quickly.
[01:07:26.492 --> 01:07:30.533]  Sunday night, obviously, there was looting and things going on, but that ended Sunday.
[01:07:30.993 --> 01:07:33.934]  Then we have this heavy police force roll in.
[01:07:34.594 --> 01:07:40.595]  But really, what I've been seeing is that at least this community here is doing something.
[01:07:40.775 --> 01:07:46.457]  Like the girl there said, that this is just a filter of rage, of years of this building up.
[01:07:47.057 --> 01:07:47.357]  I don't know.
[01:08:06.898 --> 01:08:10.780]  We can't, we can't criticize them and condemn them for what they're doing.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.561]  I mean, we had the Patriots go out to Bundy Ranch.
[01:08:13.981 --> 01:08:18.684]  These people have their own style of standing up to tyranny.
[01:08:18.704 --> 01:08:20.925]  That's right.
[01:08:20.945 --> 01:08:23.786]  And, you know, that's a very good point, Leanne.
[01:08:23.806 --> 01:08:25.547]  You know, some people, they just don't know what to do.
[01:08:25.567 --> 01:08:32.810]  And I definitely respect the people who decided to come out here and do the only thing they knew to do, which was just walk up and down the street to make their presence known.
[01:08:33.086 --> 01:08:35.246]  If that's all you know how to do, that's great.
[01:08:35.426 --> 01:08:37.507]  Just like a gentleman just walked by myself and Josh.
[01:08:37.527 --> 01:08:39.687]  He saw the light equipment that we carry.
[01:08:39.707 --> 01:08:43.248]  He said, man, you guys are out here recording with such light equipment.
[01:08:43.268 --> 01:08:44.728]  You don't have the big sets and all that stuff.
[01:08:44.928 --> 01:08:45.588]  He said, man, that's great.
[01:08:45.608 --> 01:08:46.169]  That's inspiring.
[01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.849]  I said, great, man.
[01:08:47.169 --> 01:08:51.010]  You can come out here, break out your iPhone, break out whatever you have, and start filming this.
[01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:51.990]  And that's what it's about.
[01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:55.010]  It's not about us standing on a mountain talking about we're so great.
[01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:58.051]  It's about everybody getting involved at the level that they know best.
[01:08:59.022 --> 01:09:03.703]  Jokari, one of the ladies there was saying, you know, some people are just zoning out and watching Fox News.
[01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:08.744]  We had an amazing story come out of Fox 2 there in the area.
[01:09:08.784 --> 01:09:10.324]  This is KTVI.
[01:09:10.944 --> 01:09:17.546]  They're reporting, essentially verbatim, a press release from the Sheriff's Department, and they said this.
[01:09:17.646 --> 01:09:24.067]  They said, despite reports, SWAT team was helping Al Jazeera reporters and did not take their equipment.
[01:09:24.087 --> 01:09:25.107]  Now, you were standing right there.
[01:09:25.187 --> 01:09:25.927]  I was there!
[01:09:26.588 --> 01:09:27.748]  I'll get you guys this footage.
[01:09:28.028 --> 01:09:28.568]  I was there.
[01:09:29.008 --> 01:09:29.849]  With Al Jazeera.
[01:09:29.929 --> 01:09:31.750]  I'll try to get it to you guys later tonight.
[01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:34.731]  So I'm running down the street after they shoot the smoke.
[01:09:34.771 --> 01:09:35.632]  They shoot the flashbangs.
[01:09:35.672 --> 01:09:38.793]  I'm running down the street and I see the bright lights of Al Jazeera.
[01:09:39.074 --> 01:09:40.574]  So I run over to where they are.
[01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:45.017]  And there's also, I think it was a local NBC truck was over there as well on the other side of the street.
[01:09:45.917 --> 01:09:47.558]  And I'm like, okay, they see the lights.
[01:09:47.598 --> 01:09:49.419]  They see the, uh, the big camera and all this stuff.
[01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:51.040]  They see that it's a TV set.
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.301]  This is a TV broadcast.
[01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:53.702]  They're not going to mess with these guys.
[01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:55.743]  And I was like, okay, I'm at least safe for the moment.
[01:09:56.144 --> 01:09:57.504]  No, that is not the case.
[01:09:58.104 --> 01:10:00.666]  First they start shooting rubber bullets past us.
[01:10:01.066 --> 01:10:02.727]  And they're like, are they, are they shooting us?
[01:10:02.767 --> 01:10:04.227]  I'm like, yes, they are shooting at you.
[01:10:04.627 --> 01:10:06.028]  And then I get behind their vehicle.
[01:10:06.048 --> 01:10:07.068]  Cause I know what's coming next.
[01:10:07.409 --> 01:10:12.591]  And as soon as I step behind their vehicle, you see the guy lob, lob the, uh, the smoke grenade.
[01:10:13.027 --> 01:10:19.049]  Let me read you this press release from the Sheriff's Department that basically comprised the article from Fox News.
[01:10:19.069 --> 01:10:20.089]  I just read you the headlines.
[01:10:20.109 --> 01:10:22.470]  Let me read you what the Sheriff's Department said.
[01:10:34.873 --> 01:10:43.479]  In fact, last night the SWAT team officers were assisting the media in moving their camera equipment and media personnel to a safer area.
[01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.840]  They were assisting you and the guys that they were shooting at.
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:48.602]  They were assisting you in moving their camera equipment.
[01:10:55.066 --> 01:10:56.227]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:10:56.407 --> 01:10:59.650]  I guess they felt in me running away because they were shooting at me.
[01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:01.952]  They couldn't hear what I was saying when I was saying stop.
[01:11:15.236 --> 01:11:21.240]  They thought I was consenting to them shooting at me because I was running away, and they couldn't hear what I was saying.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.822]  If you guys saw that video, if you haven't seen it, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:27.163]  They had me pinned up against a fence running down the street.
[01:11:27.303 --> 01:11:28.484]  Luckily, it was a very short fence.
[01:11:28.744 --> 01:11:30.865]  Rapid fire, boom, boom, boom.
[01:11:30.945 --> 01:11:33.527]  Three flashbangs come to where I am, and I have the choice.
[01:11:33.827 --> 01:11:40.291]  I can run through this person's yard, maybe they have a dog, maybe they come to run out and shoot me, or I can stand out here and get shot for sure by the cops.
[01:11:40.431 --> 01:11:41.572]  I said, I'll take my chances.
[01:11:41.952 --> 01:11:44.994]  Me and two other people, a guy and his girlfriend, we hop over this fence.
[01:11:45.254 --> 01:11:47.055]  We run the girls like I'm not gonna make it.
[01:11:47.075 --> 01:11:49.376]  I said mommy you gotta make it because you can't stay out here with them.
[01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:51.297]  So we get it to the other side of the yard.
[01:11:51.797 --> 01:11:54.918]  We got to lay her down in the yard and that's where I encountered Al Jazeera.
[01:11:55.238 --> 01:11:59.800]  So if they think telling us to turn off our cameras right over there then uh
[01:12:00.134 --> 01:12:02.055]  Popping the flashbangs, right over there.
[01:12:02.295 --> 01:12:04.056]  Shooting Joe Biggs, right over there.
[01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:05.977]  Gassing Josh Owens, right over there.
[01:12:06.157 --> 01:12:07.857]  Chasing me down that street, right over there.
[01:12:07.877 --> 01:12:10.158]  Then he's trying to shoot at me multiple times.
[01:12:10.198 --> 01:12:13.540]  I guess I got the cat-like reflexes and they couldn't exactly hit me.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:19.563]  It makes me very concerned that they spend all this money, all this training to shoot people and they can't even hit me.
[01:12:19.723 --> 01:12:22.764]  I guess I'm not the DHS target of the little boy that they're used to shooting at.
[01:12:22.984 --> 01:12:24.385]  But they weren't able to hit me.
[01:12:24.425 --> 01:12:28.506]  I hopped over the fence and I was able to eventually make it back to some safer ground.
[01:12:28.566 --> 01:12:29.627]  With my consent.
[01:12:29.923 --> 01:12:36.605]  Well, Jakari, with your consent, they were moving you, they were just assisting you to move to a safer area.
[01:12:36.645 --> 01:12:39.505]  They were just kind of nudging you along with those rubber bullets.
[01:12:39.585 --> 01:12:40.806]  Yeah, let's talk about that!
[01:12:40.826 --> 01:12:43.866]  They talk about, with my consent, they're pushing me down the street.
[01:12:44.067 --> 01:12:45.867]  I say, sir, can you please stop pushing me?
[01:12:46.307 --> 01:12:47.107]  You need to start walking.
[01:12:47.347 --> 01:12:48.368]  Sir, I'm walking.
[01:12:49.128 --> 01:12:49.668]  I'm walking.
[01:12:49.808 --> 01:12:50.868]  I'm not doing a slow walk.
[01:12:51.028 --> 01:12:54.069]  I'm walking at a normal, reasonable pace, but they just keep coming up.
[01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:56.550]  Multiple guys coming up, shoving me.
[01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:57.750]  Sir, what's your badge number?
[01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.470]  No response.
[01:12:58.711 --> 01:12:59.451]  Sir, what's your name?
[01:12:59.691 --> 01:13:00.192]  No response.
[01:13:00.332 --> 01:13:06.716]  Just like the cops I encountered in Austin that were at my neighbor's house, the SWAT team, nothing on their shirts, nothing on their sleeves.
[01:13:06.936 --> 01:13:13.501]  You have no way to identify these guys other than, you know, filling out some type of public information request and how long is that going to take?
[01:13:13.988 --> 01:13:15.870]  You know, it's completely ridiculous.
[01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:33.724]  A blatant lie.
[01:13:33.764 --> 01:13:45.968]  This is North Korea level propaganda and it's just amazing to me to see Fox News, a local TV channel, basically parrot back this propaganda unquestioningly and not showing what's going on.
[01:13:46.008 --> 01:13:49.970]  They do show the still pictures there and then try to attach this
[01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:54.634]  There's a different narrative to it than what people can clearly see is going on there.
[01:13:55.054 --> 01:13:57.016]  That's the problem, I think, Jakari.
[01:13:57.056 --> 01:14:11.128]  When you were talking to these people there, and some of them were happy about what Obama had done, Rand Paul had an op-ed piece that we covered earlier in the news, it was on Time Magazine, and he said that clearly these problems are systemic.
[01:14:11.849 --> 01:14:27.223]  They are decades in the making, and the fact that they have, in this particular case, because it got so much publicity, because they came after some mainstream media reporters of the Washington Post, because it got so much publicity there, they felt compelled to do something.
[01:14:27.263 --> 01:14:29.185]  But Obama just basically said, well,
[01:14:29.525 --> 01:14:33.506]  We have to understand that you can't attack the police, and that the police shouldn't attack you.
[01:14:33.566 --> 01:14:38.408]  So it's just kind of like a Rodney King, let's all just live together peacefully type of thing.
[01:14:38.448 --> 01:14:42.629]  But we have some real systemic problems that are still not going to be addressed.
[01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:45.630]  I mean, is Obama going to change the rules of engagement?
[01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:48.111]  Or is the state going to change it?
[01:14:48.211 --> 01:14:50.032]  Are the local police departments going to change it?
[01:14:50.092 --> 01:14:52.152]  Are they going to stop militarizing our police?
[01:14:52.452 --> 01:14:54.413]  Are they going to stop training the military?
[01:14:57.654 --> 01:15:06.658]  No, I do not see that at all.
[01:15:06.698 --> 01:15:09.479]  Now, I will say that the police are, you know, better behaved today.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.982]  I'm not saying that's because, you know, the actions of the President doing this or that, but I am happy to see a friendlier face out here.
[01:15:16.282 --> 01:15:21.945]  And the thing, another thing I wanted to touch on, David, that I didn't get to earlier is when they told the press to turn off
[01:15:22.815 --> 01:15:24.756]  Their phones and their cameras and so forth.
[01:15:25.036 --> 01:15:32.218]  And they gave the announcement and the whole time there's some big burly voiced guy who should do voiceovers for a living instead of aiming sniper rifles at people.
[01:15:32.798 --> 01:15:35.379]  He's up there, you know, return to your homes, do this, do that.
[01:15:35.459 --> 01:15:41.141]  Even though return to my home is a curfew, but you know, the police chief seems to think something different.
[01:15:41.421 --> 01:15:47.523]  But when they said to turn off your cameras, they had this light voice woman, turn off your, turn off your cameras and leave the area.
[01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.324]  I mean, we were like, what?
[01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:49.604]  Like, what did I say?
[01:15:49.884 --> 01:15:51.945]  And it wasn't until later on when we got to the hotel,
[01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:52.715]  That's right.
[01:16:21.448 --> 01:16:24.190]  That was that department and luckily we have cooler heads out here.
[01:16:24.471 --> 01:16:25.211]  At least thus far.
[01:16:25.271 --> 01:16:27.733]  I don't see any MRAP trucks.
[01:16:27.753 --> 01:16:29.375]  I don't see any sniper rifles.
[01:16:29.635 --> 01:16:31.757]  So hopefully the cooler heads will prevail out here.
[01:16:33.029 --> 01:16:46.414]  Well they're obviously engaging in some epic gas lighting techniques, trying to say, oh we weren't actually confiscating the cameras and that footage, we were helping them, just like the NRAP vehicles arrived.
[01:16:46.774 --> 01:16:50.635]  People who are watching, they've got the guy lighting them up, the sniper rifles, right there.
[01:16:50.675 --> 01:16:51.075]  Look at that.
[01:16:51.135 --> 01:16:51.795]  That's from last night.
[01:16:51.835 --> 01:16:52.936]  Nobody else is reporting that.
[01:16:53.459 --> 01:16:55.720]  Yeah, he's walking away with his back turned.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:57.140]  Quite a threat.
[01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:00.402]  But that's, you know, that's, you're not really actually seeing that.
[01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:02.182]  That's not, that's not there.
[01:17:02.542 --> 01:17:09.025]  And I feel like they were trying to push you back into a safer area, that safer area being the Constitution Free Zone.
[01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:10.345]  Yes!
[01:17:10.745 --> 01:17:12.206]  You've got the right to remain silent.
[01:17:12.226 --> 01:17:19.809]  Matter of fact, I want to, if we can go mobile, if we can collect the gear, and I want to walk over and show these guys the area.
[01:17:21.451 --> 01:17:25.495]  So I want to show you guys the safer area and what it was, it was safer for them.
[01:17:25.935 --> 01:17:29.258]  So I'm going to take you now to the choke point as Joe Biggs has called it.
[01:17:29.659 --> 01:17:34.323]  It's where they have the blockades, the concrete barriers.
[01:17:34.343 --> 01:17:35.264]  How you doing, bro?
[01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:37.266]  We're live right now, bro.
[01:17:37.306 --> 01:17:37.847]  Hold on to all that.
[01:17:37.867 --> 01:17:38.167]  All right.
[01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:39.328]  So we're going to keep moving right here.
[01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:42.291]  And you see all the peaceful protesters.
[01:17:42.331 --> 01:17:42.871]  Everybody's peaceful.
[01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:43.492]  This guy's peaceful.
[01:17:43.928 --> 01:17:44.729]  It doesn't have a problem.
[01:17:44.769 --> 01:17:45.850]  Look at all these tabloids.
[01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:52.617]  I think it's a good showing for us to show that we can come together like it doesn't need to be the dogs, the guns pointing at everybody.
[01:18:05.188 --> 01:18:06.509]  And everybody just wants to see peace.
[01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:08.170]  Like, white, black, Asians.
[01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:09.891]  There's all nationalities out here.
[01:18:09.931 --> 01:18:11.211]  It's not a black and white thing or nothing.
[01:18:11.231 --> 01:18:13.653]  It's just everybody coming together for a good cause.
[01:18:13.753 --> 01:18:14.733]  Were you here last night?
[01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:16.194]  I've been here all week.
[01:18:16.354 --> 01:18:17.615]  So, did you get shot at?
[01:18:17.815 --> 01:18:18.475]  Did you get the smoke?
[01:18:18.875 --> 01:18:21.917]  I got the smoke and everything, and I just thought that, you know, it was too much.
[01:18:22.037 --> 01:18:27.180]  It was just kind of like we are as of now, but it was just kind of like they were feeling something was going to happen, but it's not.
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.741]  Like, everybody just wants to see justice.
[01:18:28.841 --> 01:18:33.003]  Everybody just wants to see the betterment of the community provide and grow strong.
[01:18:33.314 --> 01:18:34.195]  Thank you, sir.
[01:18:34.355 --> 01:18:35.155]  We'll keep moving here.
[01:18:35.436 --> 01:18:37.257]  So I want to get you guys over here to the choke point.
[01:18:39.718 --> 01:18:41.880]  Right about where all the people are with these candle lights.
[01:18:43.921 --> 01:18:45.402]  This is where the police wanted to be.
[01:18:46.403 --> 01:18:47.924]  And we'll get you as close as we can up here.
[01:18:47.944 --> 01:18:52.547]  Right where all these people are, you see they're standing on a wall over here.
[01:18:52.587 --> 01:18:53.848]  This is a concrete barrier.
[01:18:54.168 --> 01:19:02.434]  And we do believe the police wanted to be here because as you can see, this location right here, nobody can come up from the sides of them, which is to say nobody could flank them if there was
[01:19:02.819 --> 01:19:03.979]  Some sort of an attack.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:14.983]  So they started us further down this way and brought us here to this location where they could be here and uh they could be here be posted without any fear of somebody trying to come up from the side.
[01:19:15.183 --> 01:19:18.164]  So that was the safe place or should I say the safe place for them.
[01:19:18.384 --> 01:19:19.805]  That's why they wanted to push us back.
[01:19:20.025 --> 01:19:23.966]  We started way down there and they moved us to in front of the quick trip so they could feel safe.
[01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:24.907]  That's what it was.
[01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:28.808]  It's how they wanted to feel safe and even at one point they kept telling us get
[01:19:34.242 --> 01:19:40.426]  So it was a safe environment for them.
[01:19:40.586 --> 01:19:44.329]  They felt threatened even though they had the heavy arm of the trucks, the snipers, etc.
[01:19:44.569 --> 01:19:44.889]  etc.
[01:19:45.109 --> 01:19:49.272]  because peaceful protesters unarmed with their hands up were about 25 feet
[01:19:50.609 --> 01:19:50.789]  I don't
[01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:11.933]  You're right.
[01:20:14.114 --> 01:20:15.616]  You're right, Jakari.
[01:20:15.656 --> 01:20:17.717]  They do try to get the cops afraid of the people.
[01:20:17.817 --> 01:20:22.821]  I mean, they try to do that at any kind of a protest, try to tell people that it's going to be a riot.
[01:20:23.141 --> 01:20:30.706]  When anybody speaks up about their individual rights, they call them sovereign citizens and try to portray them as someone who's going to try to kill the police.
[01:20:31.667 --> 01:20:41.391]  When they're telling you to move from this area to another area, you do that and comply, and then they come back and they keep moving you around, that's really just a technique to try to have a pretense for attacking people.
[01:20:42.251 --> 01:20:42.911]  Is Joe Biggs there?
[01:20:42.931 --> 01:20:45.152]  I wanted to get his take on some of these things.
[01:20:46.313 --> 01:20:48.093]  We'll move around here a little bit, David.
[01:20:48.433 --> 01:20:48.714]  Okay.
[01:20:49.514 --> 01:20:50.494]  Is Joe Biggs close by?
[01:20:51.895 --> 01:20:53.835]  Yeah, we need to catch up with him.
[01:20:53.856 --> 01:20:54.876]  He's out doing some other work.
[01:20:54.896 --> 01:20:57.277]  He's running the Ustream right now, if you guys are watching on here.
[01:20:57.497 --> 01:21:00.338]  As soon as the show is over, you can also check us out on the Ustream.
[01:21:01.081 --> 01:21:01.781]  Be there all night.
[01:21:02.221 --> 01:21:05.882]  Yeah, we'll be here until the batteries die pretty much.
[01:21:05.922 --> 01:21:17.625]  What do you think about the fact that these people, this all initiated because they were protesting police violence and the heavy hand, the police tactics that they're using there against this community.
[01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.525]  What do you think about the response?
[01:21:19.805 --> 01:21:22.906]  And then of course today they've sort of de-escalated that response.
[01:21:24.209 --> 01:21:29.772]  Yes, I mean, the people, like you said, they're not happy with the heavy marriages of the police.
[01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:38.817]  I filed a report earlier today talking to a Marine at the beginning of the March, and he said, you know, we use these type of tactics overseas in a foreign occupation.
[01:21:38.978 --> 01:21:44.401]  And he even told me that they have worse stuff in the Marines than what the police have available.
[01:21:44.581 --> 01:21:46.042]  He said, I wish we had an MRAC truck.
[01:21:46.062 --> 01:21:47.723]  I said, what kind of truck you had?
[01:21:47.763 --> 01:21:49.484]  He said they had an older version of it.
[01:21:49.844 --> 01:21:52.966]  But to answer your question, I'm glad that the cooler have
[01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:55.383]  We've got some B-roll of that Marine.
[01:21:55.403 --> 01:21:56.683]  We were just showing him walking along.
[01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:58.984]  I don't know, do we have audio for that, Rob?
[01:22:18.615 --> 01:22:30.147]  Yeah, let's go to a little bit of that audio, and then I think we're going to wrap that up, and people can join that Ustream live broadcast that Joe Biggs has got going on right now on the Alex Jones Channel, the Ustream Channel.
[01:22:30.867 --> 01:22:33.170]  Let's go to that report from the Marine.
[01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:35.212]  Stay with us, Jakari, we're going to come right back to you.
[01:22:54.809 --> 01:22:59.631]  I'm sure that peaceful protesters don't need to have snipers and tanks hounding their asses.
[01:22:59.651 --> 01:23:00.331]  Tell me why, bro.
[01:23:00.631 --> 01:23:06.152]  Because the First Amendment protects all Americans in their freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.
[01:23:06.533 --> 01:23:07.373]  You served your country?
[01:23:07.533 --> 01:23:07.813]  I did.
[01:23:07.853 --> 01:23:08.313]  I was a U.S.
[01:23:08.353 --> 01:23:09.053]  Marine in Iraq.
[01:23:09.613 --> 01:23:10.774]  So, you're telling me...
[01:23:11.534 --> 01:23:17.976]  That as a Marine, you're telling me your professional opinion is that they don't need snipers and MRAC trucks to stop these protesters.
[01:23:18.096 --> 01:23:23.678]  When it's a peaceful protester, that is clearly excessive and a violation of every single protester's constitutional rights.
[01:23:23.978 --> 01:23:30.381]  What does it make you think you go out there and you fight for your country in these foreign occupations, and now you come home and you have these measures turned against you?
[01:23:30.641 --> 01:23:35.922]  I go protect Iraqis in Iraq, and I come back and I find that my fellow Americans are being attacked by police.
[01:23:35.942 --> 01:23:36.483]  Thank you, sir.
[01:23:37.003 --> 01:23:37.503]  Get this!
[01:23:37.563 --> 01:23:38.043]  Get this!
[01:23:40.771 --> 01:23:42.975]  Don't shoot!
[01:23:43.015 --> 01:23:44.457]  Don't shoot!
[01:23:44.497 --> 01:23:45.118]  Don't shoot!
[01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:54.275]  Well, Jakari, we just watched that clip of that interview that you had with the Marine yesterday and the comments that he made, and it was interesting.
[01:23:54.335 --> 01:23:59.139]  My son was looking at comments that people were making, and they were saying just the opposite.
[01:23:59.179 --> 01:24:06.524]  They were saying, our soldiers are abroad fighting for our freedoms, and look at what's happening here at home with these violent looters.
[01:24:06.584 --> 01:24:07.645]  They were taking that position.
[01:24:07.685 --> 01:24:13.370]  They clearly did not understand what was going on, and that's largely the fault of the mainstream media.
[01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:16.953]  People like this Fox News channel basically saying that the police are there
[01:24:17.313 --> 01:24:20.255]  Helping you guys to relocate to a safer area with your consent.
[01:24:20.495 --> 01:24:22.896]  There's a lot of deliberate misinformation out there.
[01:24:22.916 --> 01:24:30.180]  But that Marine nailed it when he said, I go abroad to fight against counterinsurgency and I come back and I see it going on here.
[01:24:31.581 --> 01:24:32.841]  Amongst his fellow Americans.
[01:24:32.921 --> 01:24:33.422]  Exactly.
[01:24:35.963 --> 01:24:36.363]  That's right.
[01:24:36.383 --> 01:24:37.304]  That's exactly right.
[01:24:37.604 --> 01:24:40.285]  And I'm very glad to see people just like we keep talking about.
[01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:42.086]  It's a cultural issue.
[01:24:42.186 --> 01:24:44.168]  It's a community issue, more accurately.
[01:24:44.468 --> 01:24:46.729]  Everybody wants the same thing, what's best.
[01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:47.791]  For this community.
[01:24:47.831 --> 01:24:51.396]  Now, we do have Joe Biggs, who's waiting in the wings, ready to go.
[01:24:51.676 --> 01:24:55.902]  So if you guys give us just one second, we'll do the baton toss here and we'll get right into it.
[01:24:56.282 --> 01:24:57.824]  Alright, now this is live tonight.
[01:24:57.904 --> 01:25:00.268]  This is in Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:25:00.608 --> 01:25:01.529]  The scene of
[01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:02.490]  Of course.
[01:25:19.319 --> 01:25:23.163]  All of Alex Jones' documentaries available for you to look at.
[01:25:23.203 --> 01:25:26.345]  And of course, the nightly news begins every night at 7 o'clock.
[01:25:26.365 --> 01:25:28.467]  Tonight we have a very long live edition.
[01:25:28.527 --> 01:25:30.749]  It's about 8.22 central time right now.
[01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:37.055]  We're about to go to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, who's with Jakari Jackson, live in Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:25:37.115 --> 01:25:38.796]  A very different night tonight, isn't it, Joe?
[01:25:39.957 --> 01:25:40.658]  Roger that.
[01:25:40.858 --> 01:25:45.182]  It's Joe Biggs, InfoWars.com, at the QT parking lot in Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:25:45.982 --> 01:26:08.557]  Tonight's a lot more calmer and the reason why is because we don't have a militarized force out here pointing down You know pointing sniper rifles at civil people out here hanging out trying to protest doing the right thing Now tonight you have the cops walking around amongst the people with no weapon presence whatsoever Whatever, you know their pieces on their side, but nothing is drawn.
[01:26:09.468 --> 01:26:13.370]  You know, yesterday we didn't even get the low ready with the weapon pointed down.
[01:26:13.671 --> 01:26:22.816]  They had the weapons up, pointing at us, being very intimidating, and that does nothing but cause people to get aggressive and feel uncomfortable when a weapon's pointed at them.
[01:26:23.216 --> 01:26:23.917]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:24.297 --> 01:26:25.658]  And they're doing that deliberately.
[01:26:25.678 --> 01:26:34.463]  I mean, anybody who is a professional, if they're trained in the Army, if they're trained as a policeman, they know that you don't point a gun at somebody casually.
[01:26:34.763 --> 01:26:36.745]  You don't do it unless you're planning on shooting them.
[01:26:38.065 --> 01:26:38.986]  Everybody understands that.
[01:26:39.753 --> 01:26:42.995]  Well, in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have what's called rules of engagement.
[01:26:43.335 --> 01:26:44.976]  You don't shot unless shot upon.
[01:26:45.356 --> 01:26:48.338]  Well, we're not seeing the police have that same mentality.
[01:26:48.818 --> 01:26:52.940]  They're shooting first and then eventually asking questions later.
[01:26:53.439 --> 01:26:55.000]  Well, I'll tell you what the difference is, Joe.
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:27:04.807]  The difference is that tonight they've had feedback from people because of people like you and Jakari and the rest of the press that are there covering this.
[01:27:05.107 --> 01:27:10.090]  If the press wasn't there covering this, then they would not have changed what they're doing.
[01:27:10.150 --> 01:27:12.732]  It probably would have been the same or even worse tonight.
[01:27:14.113 --> 01:27:19.597]  You know, what I've seen in the mainstream media is how they want to portray this whole racial divide amongst people.
[01:27:19.677 --> 01:27:19.877]  Yes.
[01:27:19.977 --> 01:27:22.559]  And what I've seen today has been complete and total love
[01:27:23.010 --> 01:27:23.871]  Amongst everyone.
[01:27:23.911 --> 01:27:25.732]  And I saw that yesterday as well throughout the day.
[01:27:26.072 --> 01:27:35.317]  You know, when I got shot last night, it was two young African-American men who helped me up off the ground and then showed me how to get out of here back so I can meet up with Jakari and Josh.
[01:27:35.597 --> 01:27:36.978]  And then again today, I saw one of them.
[01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:39.179]  He walked up to me and said, Hey, are you okay?
[01:27:39.199 --> 01:27:40.240]  You know, I just, I'm concerned.
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.121]  I want to make sure you're fine.
[01:27:41.521 --> 01:27:46.924]  But you know, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, all of these guys want to tell you that everyone out here is full of hate.
[01:27:47.004 --> 01:27:48.805]  There's this huge racial divide that
[01:27:49.164 --> 01:27:52.045]  The blacks hate the whites, the whites hate the blacks, and I don't see that at all.
[01:27:52.165 --> 01:27:59.347]  Everyone out here, I saw black guys, white guys, everyone holding hands and praying and saying, hey, we need to stand up for this injustice.
[01:27:59.547 --> 01:28:01.407]  This police brutality is going too far.
[01:28:01.687 --> 01:28:02.247]  It's happening.
[01:28:02.287 --> 01:28:03.108]  It's running rampant.
[01:28:03.408 --> 01:28:12.090]  And the only way we can defeat this is not with violence, but through peaceful protests, sitting down and trying to let them understand that we have concerns that we want answers.
[01:28:12.585 --> 01:28:19.472]  You know, Joe, Leanne's got a question for you in just a second, but I pointed out to Jakari earlier a Fox News report.
[01:28:19.492 --> 01:28:35.288]  You're talking about how they're putting out a false narrative about how this is the black people out of control, and yet what you see here is our peaceful demonstrators, a lot of brotherhood, common cause about this, that they need to get control of the rules of engagement of the police, but listen to what
[01:28:35.748 --> 01:28:41.430]  Fox News said about these Al Jazeera reporters, and of course we've all seen the video over and over again.
[01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:44.291]  It's an iconic video, as Alex Jones pointed out on the radio show today.
[01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:55.894]  This is the kind of iconic video that rises to the level of that picture where you had the university cop out in California tear gassing these people who are peacefully sitting on the ground.
[01:28:56.274 --> 01:29:04.457]  Now we've got this video of the Missouri police tear gassing the press there and then shutting down their equipment.
[01:29:05.157 --> 01:29:06.978]  Fox News reported this, Joe.
[01:29:07.018 --> 01:29:13.381]  They said, despite the reports, the SWAT team was merely helping Al Jazeera reporters and did not take their equipment.
[01:29:13.721 --> 01:29:22.865]  It says that they were assisting the media in moving their camera equipment and the media personnel to a safer area with the media's consent.
[01:29:23.625 --> 01:29:24.766]  Is that what you think happened?
[01:29:26.018 --> 01:29:29.981]  What snake wrote that?
[01:29:30.382 --> 01:29:32.903]  The snake that wrote that was the Sheriff's Department.
[01:29:32.924 --> 01:29:43.011]  That was their news release, but their news release was put out without comment, without video, without getting any other side of the story by Fox News.
[01:29:43.051 --> 01:29:46.193]  They just parroted that news release from the Sheriff's Department.
[01:29:46.233 --> 01:29:53.579]  What I read you was what the Sheriff's Department put out there, and KTVI, Channel 2 News, Fox affiliate,
[01:29:54.079 --> 01:29:59.365]  Put this story out saying that merely they were just helping you guys to move to a safer area with your consent.
[01:29:59.805 --> 01:30:00.766]  Well, those guys are here.
[01:30:00.806 --> 01:30:02.168]  I need to go ask them a question then.
[01:30:02.188 --> 01:30:02.408]  You should.
[01:30:02.428 --> 01:30:04.210]  Because that is completely mind-blowing.
[01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:04.630]  You should.
[01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:07.693]  The fact that they would say something like that.
[01:30:07.914 --> 01:30:09.836]  You need to confront Fox News about that.
[01:30:09.856 --> 01:30:12.779]  That would be a great thing to do right after this with the live Ustream.
[01:30:13.439 --> 01:30:15.161]  Oh, I can't even believe.
[01:30:15.201 --> 01:30:15.822]  I haven't even seen that.
[01:30:15.842 --> 01:30:16.703]  That blows my mind.
[01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:19.131]  That they were assisting them take down their equipment?
[01:30:19.171 --> 01:30:23.772]  Yeah, they were destroying it and trying to ruin any evidence of the truth that was happening.
[01:30:24.052 --> 01:30:27.333]  The fact that they were brutally attacking people who were sitting there.
[01:30:27.513 --> 01:30:29.313]  There were babies on the front lines out there.
[01:30:29.413 --> 01:30:30.414]  There were little kids.
[01:30:30.694 --> 01:30:31.614]  That is ridiculous.
[01:30:31.854 --> 01:30:33.455]  There was no assisting whatsoever.
[01:30:33.735 --> 01:30:34.835]  The cops were out of control.
[01:30:34.855 --> 01:30:35.955]  It was complete lawlessness.
[01:30:36.415 --> 01:30:37.816]  That was tyranny to the T.
[01:30:38.581 --> 01:30:40.162]  That's why you're there.
[01:30:40.382 --> 01:30:51.149]  That's why we have InfoWars reporters there, because that's the kind of information, the kind of disinformation, the kind of lies that the mainstream media has been putting out in these past riots.
[01:30:51.569 --> 01:31:03.617]  That's why we have reporters now going to these different events, so that we can tell people what we see, so that we can record this and show the eyewitness video, stream it live, which you guys are going to continue to do tonight, right Joe?
[01:31:04.338 --> 01:31:05.159]  Roger that.
[01:31:05.399 --> 01:31:09.002]  You know, and it's funny, they're saying it's protect and serve, but they didn't protect anything.
[01:31:09.242 --> 01:31:13.726]  And the only thing they served was a handful of violence and just fear.
[01:31:14.907 --> 01:31:17.169]  It's... I just don't get it.
[01:31:17.509 --> 01:31:23.114]  You know, you know, the other day they were allowing the people to come into this town to loot.
[01:31:23.915 --> 01:31:25.136]  They didn't even try to stop.
[01:31:25.156 --> 01:31:30.500]  I can't believe it took this many days for them to pull this police force away from here.
[01:31:30.961 --> 01:31:32.382]  They allowed the looting and then
[01:31:32.935 --> 01:31:38.479]  They came out here with 70 guys and the guys had that look in their eye.
[01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:40.401]  I've seen that look before in combat.
[01:31:40.941 --> 01:31:45.385]  That is the look of wanting to shoot somebody to get that thrill from something.
[01:31:45.425 --> 01:31:46.826]  That's what I saw last night.
[01:31:47.106 --> 01:31:51.870]  The same eye I've seen in combat in Fallujah and different places in combat.
[01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:52.951]  That was ridiculous.
[01:31:52.991 --> 01:31:55.593]  We don't need to see something like that on the streets of America.
[01:31:55.773 --> 01:32:02.238]  And the sad thing is, is if we don't get up off our butts and do the right thing and start getting informed, it's gonna happen.
[01:32:03.356 --> 01:32:15.504]  Well, Joe, you witnessed with your own eyes them firing tear gas at people in their own yards and overhead, over buildings, just firing into neighborhoods.
[01:32:15.544 --> 01:32:17.185]  People are saying, where am I supposed to go?
[01:32:17.205 --> 01:32:18.326]  This is my house.
[01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.687]  That could have caught their home on fire.
[01:32:21.328 --> 01:32:30.074]  And basically, they just seemed like they could not wait to get to use all of this heavy military-grade equipment that they have been
[01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:33.527]  Gifted by the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:35.528]  They just, they couldn't wait to use it.
[01:32:36.008 --> 01:32:37.669]  Well, our government got them all those toys.
[01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:39.209]  Of course, they wanted to go out and use them.
[01:32:40.170 --> 01:32:42.211]  You know, this was a play day.
[01:32:42.931 --> 01:32:48.373]  You know, they got their tanks, they got their guns, they got all their stuff, their machine guns, their flashbangs.
[01:32:48.613 --> 01:32:49.734]  Oh, it was a good old party.
[01:32:49.754 --> 01:32:51.375]  It was a great time.
[01:32:51.395 --> 01:32:54.056]  So you didn't consent to that shot to the kidney?
[01:32:54.076 --> 01:32:58.618]  Oh yeah, that, I completely, I said, I said, officer, you know what?
[01:32:59.915 --> 01:33:01.336]  This hasn't got chaotic enough.
[01:33:01.356 --> 01:33:05.498]  Could you please just shoot me right here while I'm running away from the tear gas?
[01:33:05.658 --> 01:33:06.078]  Yeah.
[01:33:06.198 --> 01:33:09.400]  You just weren't motivated enough to get out of the area to get somewhere safer.
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:14.482]  And of course, the question is, what was challenging your safety was the police themselves.
[01:33:14.562 --> 01:33:17.964]  I mean, there's a shot of Joe's injury there.
[01:33:18.524 --> 01:33:21.926]  That massive bruise there is from where he was shot with a rubber bullet.
[01:33:22.006 --> 01:33:24.847]  Meanwhile, Joe's been suffering with internal bleeding.
[01:33:24.867 --> 01:33:27.229]  Yeah, well that doesn't help out at all.
[01:33:28.206 --> 01:33:29.626]  You know, I hit the ground.
[01:33:29.666 --> 01:33:34.247]  I just took my breath out and literally right as I hit to the ground, people are like, Hey, are you okay?
[01:33:34.267 --> 01:33:34.767]  Are you okay?
[01:33:35.047 --> 01:33:38.208]  And two canisters, one went to the right of me and another to the left.
[01:33:38.228 --> 01:33:40.188]  And you can see the burn marks over here where I was at.
[01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:41.969]  It was just chaotic.
[01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:44.669]  And the next thing you know, I took a breathe in because I lost my breath.
[01:33:45.269 --> 01:33:47.730]  And then I'm sitting there just throwing up all over the place.
[01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:51.151]  No one needs to experience that stuff.
[01:33:51.191 --> 01:33:52.591]  I mean, that is just crazy.
[01:33:52.931 --> 01:33:56.932]  And I honestly feel bad for a lot of these younger kids who had to go through that last night.
[01:33:57.152 --> 01:33:57.732]  That's gotta be
[01:33:58.547 --> 01:34:02.454]  Terrifying for someone that age to not understand why this is happening.
[01:34:03.376 --> 01:34:11.120]  Right, well they wanted to make it very clear that we all have the right to remain silent while they stamp their boot down on our face.
[01:34:11.781 --> 01:34:12.881]  That's where our rights are at.
[01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:15.903]  Joe, I want to read you this quote from John F. Kennedy.
[01:34:16.043 --> 01:34:17.864]  So obviously this is going back decades.
[01:34:17.924 --> 01:34:24.527]  He says, those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.
[01:34:25.088 --> 01:34:28.149]  Is that what you experienced there on the front lines last night?
[01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:29.530]  People saw it escalate.
[01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:31.311]  That was definitely last night.
[01:34:32.284 --> 01:34:33.304]  Completely, Leanne.
[01:34:34.304 --> 01:34:42.766]  I mean, we have peaceful protesters being intimidated, having guns pointed directly at them and beams on them when their backs are turned.
[01:34:44.086 --> 01:34:44.987]  It was so cowardly.
[01:34:45.007 --> 01:34:47.647]  I just, I could not fathom.
[01:34:47.707 --> 01:34:48.807]  I couldn't grasp.
[01:34:49.328 --> 01:34:57.369]  I kept pinching myself saying, am I, am I having a dream, a flashback from something in combat and it's mixed up with something that could happen to you?
[01:34:57.589 --> 01:35:01.390]  And I kept sitting there and as I could finally see from my eyes not burning anymore,
[01:35:01.952 --> 01:35:05.356]  My eyes were completely swollen and I'm sitting there like, this is really happening.
[01:35:05.576 --> 01:35:10.041]  And then to my left, as I'm running, I'm hopping fences through this neighborhood back here.
[01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:12.163]  These kids are leading me and I'm hopping over.
[01:35:12.183 --> 01:35:16.728]  And all I can hear to my left are shot, like, you know, the shotguns, the explosions.
[01:35:16.928 --> 01:35:19.231]  I mean, it was pure, total chaos.
[01:35:19.291 --> 01:35:21.433]  It's what I've seen in urban combat.
[01:35:22.472 --> 01:35:33.034]  Well, Joe, thanks, and I'm interested to see you guys get some footage of confronting these Fox News people, that's KTVI, as well as talking to the Al Jazeera people.
[01:35:33.414 --> 01:35:42.616]  Ask them if they gave their consent to be shot at with rubber bullets, with tear gas canisters, if they gave their consent as they were running them out of the area.
[01:35:43.057 --> 01:35:45.037]  I think it'd be very interesting to talk to those people.
[01:35:45.097 --> 01:35:49.518]  And, of course, you guys are going to continue to be broadcasting live on Ustream.
[01:35:50.018 --> 01:35:55.202]  We're here live with the nightly news and we're going to conclude our live portion of our program right now.
[01:35:55.242 --> 01:35:56.243]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:35:56.823 --> 01:36:03.829]  Joe, be very careful there and see if you can get some comments from those guys about how grateful and thankful because that was the other thing they said.
[01:36:03.869 --> 01:36:09.333]  They said that Al Jazeera actually thanked their officers for doing that last night.
[01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:13.817]  I'm pretty sure they didn't use any words in that order that nightly.
[01:36:13.877 --> 01:36:14.337]  I doubt that.
[01:36:14.642 --> 01:36:16.143]  Thank you for burning my eyes!
[01:36:16.223 --> 01:36:23.826]  Well, thank you so much, and we'll be watching the live Ustream that you guys are going to be continuing on with tonight.
[01:36:24.286 --> 01:36:25.047]  Be careful there.
[01:36:25.647 --> 01:36:33.670]  And we've got, if you're not a subscriber to Prison Planet, this is a live broadcast of the nightly news, a very long extended broadcast.
[01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:35.251]  This one is an hour and a half tonight.
[01:36:35.651 --> 01:36:37.972]  This is something that you can share with other people.
[01:36:38.032 --> 01:36:39.633]  We've got more content coming up.
[01:36:40.013 --> 01:36:41.434]  We have a special report coming up.
[01:36:42.114 --> 01:36:47.699]  If you subscribe to Prison Planet TV, of course, you can share this stream with up to 11 other people.
[01:36:48.019 --> 01:36:51.782]  You can save a couple of months price if you get a one-year subscription to that.
[01:36:52.342 --> 01:36:56.225]  And, of course, you can also share all of Alex Jones' documentaries.
[01:36:56.265 --> 01:36:58.307]  Those are always available for someone to look at.
[01:36:58.347 --> 01:37:00.129]  It's a great way to keep people awake.
[01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:02.851]  Quite frankly, it's a very different situation in prison.
[01:37:03.291 --> 01:37:08.595]  Ferguson, Missouri tonight, and I think the reason for that is because of press coverage.
[01:37:09.016 --> 01:37:14.600]  And I don't think it's because of the kind of press coverage that we see from the mainstream media, from Fox News or anyone.
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:27.270]  I think it's because the kind of honest coverage that we're getting from Jokari and from Joe Biggs and Josh Owens, who are risking their lives there, who are standing and telling the truth about what's going on.
[01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:29.412]  That's what's making the difference.
[01:37:29.632 --> 01:37:32.414]  That's what's changed the rules of engagement tonight.
[01:37:32.594 --> 01:37:42.986]  And I just wanted to point out that the reason why having a Prison Planet subscription is so important is because at any time they can suspend our YouTube account.
[01:37:43.527 --> 01:37:45.529]  They can suspend our Twitter.
[01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:47.812]  They can take the videos down.
[01:37:51.018 --> 01:37:51.999]  And we saw that last night.
[01:37:52.039 --> 01:37:53.980]  We saw them messing with Facebook.
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.440]  We saw them messing with Twitter.
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.641]  We couldn't tweet things out.
[01:37:56.701 --> 01:38:03.045]  So it's very important that we have an alternative media outlet to our own independent media outlet.
[01:38:03.465 --> 01:38:11.129]  Your subscription helps to support that bandwidth, to help keep this organization going, to help pay for sending reporters into the field.
[01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:15.672]  They're willing to do this and report on it, but it's expensive to send them there.
[01:38:16.092 --> 01:38:18.513]  Now, that concludes our news portion of the broadcast.
[01:38:18.553 --> 01:38:19.374]  Of course, the Ustream
[01:38:20.014 --> 01:38:21.074]  We'll be live.
[01:38:21.114 --> 01:38:22.675]  They're still doing reports out there.
[01:38:22.695 --> 01:38:23.576]  You may see them.
[01:38:23.636 --> 01:38:33.560]  Hopefully they can get in contact with these Al Jazeera news people who were escorted out of the area by the police with tear gas and bullets using their consent.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:37.722]  Maybe they can talk to the Fox News channel and say, what are you guys thinking?
[01:38:38.182 --> 01:38:41.123]  But we do have another special report coming up from Leanne.
[01:38:41.163 --> 01:38:42.544]  Leanne, tell us about your special report.
[01:38:43.004 --> 01:39:02.182]  Well, while we've got all of this chaos going on in Missouri, let's not forget the borders are still wide open, and this next report that I've got coming up next, I kind of wanted to break it down, and you know, this whole crisis has been sort of a slap in the face to a lot of different types of Americans, and this video will really help
[01:39:02.802 --> 01:39:26.481]  You can kind of share it with your friends to say this is why we're so upset about the way that they are trying to push through this amnesty for all these illegal immigrants and why we might be concerned about all of these people coming here and flooding this country because there are so many different types of people who are being insulted with the way the government is handling this current border crisis.
[01:39:26.561 --> 01:39:28.342]  They're trying to balkanize the population.
[01:39:28.382 --> 01:39:33.407]  You can see it in their coverage of this event here, trying to break people into groups.
[01:39:33.447 --> 01:39:34.307]  They don't worry about it.
[01:39:34.427 --> 01:39:35.989]  It's just out-of-control black people.
[01:39:36.349 --> 01:39:39.451]  You should stay in your homes and watch Dancing with the Stars or whatever.
[01:39:39.532 --> 01:39:40.412]  Don't get involved.
[01:39:40.492 --> 01:39:41.934]  It's just these troublemakers over here.
[01:39:42.274 --> 01:39:42.834]  They do that.
[01:39:42.894 --> 01:39:46.177]  They compartmentalize the different ethnic groups.
[01:39:46.217 --> 01:39:49.059]  They try to balkanize America, and that's a key part of this.
[01:39:49.119 --> 01:39:53.143]  The difference in the way that they're treating people right now is very evident.
[01:39:53.183 --> 01:39:54.264]  So that report is coming up.
[01:39:55.505 --> 01:39:57.008]  And let's cut to that report.
[01:39:57.068 --> 01:39:57.850]  That's it for tonight.
[01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:59.112]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:39:59.333 --> 01:40:03.541]  And please, if you're not a Prison Planet TV subscriber, please consider supporting our operation.
[01:40:03.841 --> 01:40:04.142]  Good night.
[01:40:04.182 --> 01:40:05.545]  We'll be back tomorrow at 7 central.
[01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:36.672]  It is only fitting that a free scream should sound the alarm against those who would destroy freedom.
[01:40:37.232 --> 01:40:44.956]  For in its power to deceive and inflame, or enlighten and inspire, the motion picture has no equal.
[01:40:54.827 --> 01:40:58.610]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[01:40:59.030 --> 01:41:00.251]  I can, like, taste dirt in it.
[01:41:00.311 --> 01:41:01.432]  God knows what's in this.
[01:41:01.572 --> 01:41:02.572]  This has an aftertaste.
[01:41:02.613 --> 01:41:04.194]  Tastes like Austin water?
[01:41:04.434 --> 01:41:05.294]  Yeah, it does.
[01:41:05.354 --> 01:41:09.517]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:41:09.758 --> 01:41:15.862]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:41:16.082 --> 01:41:16.823]  I call it H2O.
[01:41:16.843 --> 01:41:18.384]  That one is better.
[01:41:18.444 --> 01:41:19.444]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:41:19.725 --> 01:41:19.845]  Yep.
[01:41:19.865 --> 01:41:21.106]  I know what good water tastes like.
[01:41:21.166 --> 01:41:21.686]  It's good water.
[01:41:21.786 --> 01:41:30.316]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, Monsanto's deadly pesticide, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:41:30.736 --> 01:41:38.225]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[01:41:38.525 --> 01:41:41.028]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:41:41.588 --> 01:41:43.931]  Yeah, it has that processed flavor to it.
[01:41:44.272 --> 01:41:53.844]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances and many more, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:41:54.024 --> 01:41:55.606]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:41:55.646 --> 01:41:56.367]  It's good water.
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:57.480]  Refreshing.
[01:41:57.921 --> 01:41:58.281]  It's good.

[01:42:27.414 --> 01:42:32.319]  The thing about it is they allowed everybody to loot something.
[01:42:32.979 --> 01:42:33.700]  Yeah, that's what I heard.
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:40.566]  One of the guys you spoke to earlier said the cops were blocking an area and literally letting the masses drive by and then go into the shopping center.
[01:42:40.626 --> 01:42:47.432]  They surrounded, they surrounded the entire community at each end and let everybody loot and do everything they wanted to do.
[01:42:47.952 --> 01:42:49.894]  Do what now?
[01:42:49.934 --> 01:42:52.336]  Oh no, I was just finishing.
[01:42:52.416 --> 01:42:53.677]  I mean, when it comes down to it,
[01:42:54.517 --> 01:43:00.582]  I mean this is all a ploy basically to make sure that everybody begins a war with the police.
[01:43:01.562 --> 01:43:21.137]  Even though they're rioting for a reason, for a cause, but of course they're going to try to use militia, they're going to try to use, you know, of course the facade version of America, you know what I'm saying, the facade version of America just sees a bunch of people running around, hectic, and just wanting to destroy their community and that's not what's going on right now.
[01:43:22.003 --> 01:43:28.308]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:43:28.668 --> 01:43:30.149]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[01:43:30.169 --> 01:43:31.550]  This is the best iodine out there.
[01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:32.931]  And I know this for a fact.
[01:43:33.491 --> 01:43:38.255]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:38.395 --> 01:43:42.478]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:43:42.658 --> 01:43:47.862]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:57.414 --> 01:44:11.161]  Well each week we're hearing more and more stories about how people entering this country illegally are being treated and oftentimes the news is a huge slap in the face to the rest of America and especially Americans who've been waiting for a bit of reprieve of their own.
[01:44:11.181 --> 01:44:16.324]  Now most recently we reported on this refurbished detention center near San Antonio.
[01:44:16.624 --> 01:44:20.006]  It's always been a detention facility but it recently got an upgrade and
[01:44:20.166 --> 01:44:29.833]  And all of the suites feature flat screen televisions, the whole facility got a new facelift, a good paint job, it has a soccer field, and of course a little ping pong action.
[01:44:30.053 --> 01:44:31.914]  Now, this is just one facility.
[01:44:32.354 --> 01:44:37.858]  Nationwide, illegal aliens are enjoying a slew of taxpayer subsidized benefits.
[01:44:38.178 --> 01:44:45.884]  This includes housing, food, vocational training, education, legal counsel, and also an allowance.
[01:44:46.364 --> 01:44:48.766]  Now, taking into consideration that San Antonio
[01:44:49.326 --> 01:44:54.068]  On any given night has about 3,000 homeless people in its city.
[01:44:54.388 --> 01:45:00.371]  Now do you think that these homeless people are enjoying a hot meal and flat-screen television and a little game of ping-pong?
[01:45:00.931 --> 01:45:01.951]  Absolutely not!
[01:45:02.292 --> 01:45:07.934]  Now here are just a few types of Americans who have it worse off than people who are in this country illegally.
[01:45:08.134 --> 01:45:19.720]  While illegal immigrants are enjoying free health care, shelter, and a hot meal at military bases across the country, there were nearly 60,000 homeless veterans on any given night in 2013.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:29.405]  Now back in 2008, Barack Obama promised to make the VA a leader of health care reform so that our veterans could get the best care possible.
[01:45:29.445 --> 01:45:30.025]  Possible.
[01:45:30.426 --> 01:45:45.476]  Now, while Obama has promised to use his magic pen to pass sweeping immigration reform practically overnight, veterans are literally dying waiting for him to fulfill his promise to them six years later.
[01:45:45.496 --> 01:45:51.761]  And last December, Democrats rallied to reduce cost of living increases for veterans.
[01:45:52.121 --> 01:45:58.986]  Meanwhile, they blocked Senator Jeff Sessions' bill, which would have closed a tax loophole for illegal immigrants.
[01:45:59.346 --> 01:46:09.117]  This 4.2 billion dollar loophole allows illegal aliens to collect child tax credits from the IRS even if they pay no taxes.
[01:46:09.417 --> 01:46:14.843]  Now these fraudulent payments to illegal aliens would have offset the cuts to veterans benefits.
[01:46:16.385 --> 01:46:24.370]  And in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security released more than 36,000 known convicted criminal illegal aliens.
[01:46:24.730 --> 01:46:37.239]  These were illegal aliens that were convicted of crimes of sexual assault, homicide, vehicle convictions, dangerous drug convictions, and 16,000 drunk or drugged driving convictions.
[01:46:37.779 --> 01:46:45.244]  However, it is the veterans the Department of Homeland Security has listed as domestic extremists and threats to America.
[01:46:45.644 --> 01:46:47.286]  And the list goes on and on.
[01:46:47.727 --> 01:46:56.818]  After sacrificing so much for this country, veterans are clearly being mistreated, while illegal aliens breaking the law to enter this country, the red carpets rolled out for them.
[01:46:57.359 --> 01:46:59.061]  And it's not just our veterans.
[01:46:59.462 --> 01:47:03.006]  What about the children that actually are our responsibility?
[01:47:03.166 --> 01:47:04.388]  America's school children.
[01:47:04.568 --> 01:47:11.632]  Texas taxpayers are going to be shelling out approximately $45 million to educate foreign minors.
[01:47:11.852 --> 01:47:15.875]  In Texas alone, around 4,800 foreign minors have been set free.
[01:47:15.935 --> 01:47:24.019]  Now, assuming that these minors aren't immediately deported, which they won't be, they're going to be expected to enter the public school system come fall.
[01:47:24.399 --> 01:47:31.484]  Now, Texas Education Agency General Counsel David Anderson reportedly said that the state pays about $7,900 per student to districts.
[01:47:34.045 --> 01:47:41.629]  Now these children are going to come with certain needs like free or reduced lunch qualification, as well as bilingual or special needs.
[01:47:41.929 --> 01:47:47.832]  So we'll estimate about $9,500 per student to be paid to the districts for those students.
[01:47:48.392 --> 01:47:53.775]  Texas is going to shell out more than $45 million to educate these children.
[01:47:54.315 --> 01:48:01.720]  Now, take into consideration that for years, for years, we have been suffering with education budget cuts.
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:03.521]  Reduced free lunches.
[01:48:03.541 --> 01:48:06.983]  They don't have school buses to take their children to and from school.
[01:48:07.043 --> 01:48:12.587]  There's not enough teachers to teach the amount of kids that are in their classroom already, so they're getting subpar education.
[01:48:12.907 --> 01:48:20.109]  And more than two-thirds of states are providing less per-student funding for K-12 education than they did in fiscal year 2008.
[01:48:21.569 --> 01:48:36.333]  So this means at a time when it is so important to be developing technical and analytical skills for American students so we can compete globally, funding is being cut and schools are forced to scale back the educational services that they provide.
[01:48:36.733 --> 01:48:43.080]  So now all of a sudden states are going to be forking over millions of dollars to pay for these illegal alien children.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.481]  What about our children?
[01:48:44.561 --> 01:48:47.464]  Who is going to be taking care of the children here in America?
[01:48:47.805 --> 01:48:56.413]  If there was ever any more proof that you needed that this country is quickly devolving into a third world status, look at how it educates its children.
[01:48:57.114 --> 01:49:00.978]  And not only that, but let's talk about the foster children in America.
[01:49:01.379 --> 01:49:10.668]  The federal government is desperate to find housing for all of these illegal immigrants, and they are willing to pay up to $40 a day for anyone who's willing to foster.
[01:49:11.048 --> 01:49:18.476]  You can make up to $7,400 a month, considering you can house up to six illegal aliens at any given time.
[01:49:19.437 --> 01:49:23.742]  Let's look at what states pay to foster your average American child.
[01:49:24.263 --> 01:49:29.489]  More than 250,000 children entered foster care in fiscal year 2012.
[01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:40.001]  But the average foster care reimbursement rates to foster an American child are less than half of what the government is willing to pay to shelter an illegal.
[01:49:40.541 --> 01:49:45.008]  Average rates are around $500 a month, far less in some states.
[01:49:45.348 --> 01:49:50.676]  Now the government is basically incentivizing the fostering of one group over another.
[01:49:50.696 --> 01:49:56.124]  And not only that, foster children in America age out of state care at the age of 18.
[01:49:57.265 --> 01:50:03.470]  Most of them are just put out into the world on their own without housing, financial assistance, or emotional support.
[01:50:03.831 --> 01:50:10.977]  Now compare that to this current illegal immigration effort where adults will be fostered up to age 23.
[01:50:11.317 --> 01:50:18.103]  Now this might be surprising given that the mainstream media has largely portrayed this border crisis as being only children.
[01:50:18.343 --> 01:50:24.108]  Now Nancy Pelosi just wants us to all think of these kids as refugee baby Jesus.
[01:50:24.528 --> 01:50:30.451]  But what about the fact that nearly one quarter of all of America's homeless were children in 2013?
[01:50:31.252 --> 01:50:38.956]  According to the most recent Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, in 2013 there were about 610,000 homeless individuals in the United States, and more than 215,000 of them are living unsheltered.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:54.582]  So where is the billion-dollar emergency fund to build these facilities for our citizens, most of whom are veterans, women, and children?
[01:50:55.022 --> 01:51:00.543]  And not to mention the fact that these facilities are used to house citizens in the event of an emergency.
[01:51:00.963 --> 01:51:08.285]  Now, earlier this year, Texas Governor Rick Perry voiced his concerns about what would happen in the event of an emergency, saying,
[01:51:09.025 --> 01:51:13.430]  If these illegal immigrants are in these detention facilities, citizens will have nowhere to go.
[01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:15.352]  Well, he was right to worry.
[01:51:15.752 --> 01:51:31.108]  National Weather Service Coordinator Barry Goldsmith told reporters, should a hurricane or other life-threatening catastrophic weather event impact South Texas, illegal aliens occupying various shelters will be first in line to get to safer ground.
[01:51:31.408 --> 01:51:35.209]  Women and children first, unless you are an American.
[01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:42.972]  And while we're talking about all these illegal immigrants, what about the people who have gone through the process of entering this country legally?
[01:51:43.392 --> 01:51:49.314]  Americans who came here through the legal immigration process have spent years waiting to qualify for U.S.
[01:51:49.434 --> 01:51:50.014]  citizenship.
[01:51:50.334 --> 01:51:54.156]  They have had to shuffle through years of paperwork, waiting periods, and fees.
[01:51:54.476 --> 01:52:00.698]  They must prove the ability to read, write, and speak basic English, prove they are free from contagious diseases,
[01:52:01.498 --> 01:52:15.323]  Those entering the country now in record numbers have already proven that they disregard the laws of this nation.
[01:52:15.583 --> 01:52:27.767]  And in fact, they don't care about entering this country illegally because they believe that they're going to be forgiven for breaking the law and then granted amnesty without having to go through the process of becoming a legal
[01:52:28.267 --> 01:52:28.848]  We're good.
[01:52:49.884 --> 01:52:55.746]  Now last summer, Judicial Watch reported that legislation crafted by the bipartisan Gang of Eight in the U.S.
[01:52:55.786 --> 01:53:03.528]  Senate would grant amnesty to illegal aliens with drunk driving, domestic violence, aggravated assault, and child abuse convictions.
[01:53:04.128 --> 01:53:11.630]  However, being guilty of these crimes would permanently bar an applicant from legally obtaining citizenship to the U.S.
[01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:19.656]  So will we begin to allow anyone with a checkered past to enter the United States or just those who entered the country illegally?
[01:53:19.877 --> 01:53:29.585]  Now according to top Virginia official Corey Stewart, he said it's ironic that under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, if you are a U.S.
[01:53:29.725 --> 01:53:33.748]  citizen and you are a sex offender, you are registered and you're tracked.
[01:53:34.128 --> 01:53:35.590]  But if you are an illegal alien,
[01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:40.595]  The local police have no way of knowing where you are because ICE will not tell you.
[01:53:40.915 --> 01:53:42.176]  The justification given?
[01:53:42.717 --> 01:53:43.397]  Privacy.
[01:53:43.417 --> 01:53:50.004]  Now of course this privacy means that illegal alien sexual offenders are free to repeat crimes.
[01:53:50.344 --> 01:53:50.845]  And they do.
[01:53:51.345 --> 01:54:00.350]  This chart compares the consequences for an array of crimes and discovers that while illegal immigrants might be exonerated and legalized, U.S.
[01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:10.055]  citizens and legal immigrants face years of incarceration or temporary expulsion from the country for committing the same crime.
[01:54:10.755 --> 01:54:15.320]  And of course there's the TSA who's supposed to be protecting us all from terrorists.
[01:54:15.641 --> 01:54:25.312]  Now they just love to exert their authority by sticking their hands down the pants of wheelchair-bound little girls or forcing American moms to drink their own breast milk.
[01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:30.217]  And they humiliate cancer victims all in the name of keeping America safe.
[01:54:30.758 --> 01:54:38.146]  However, it emerged that the TSA was allowing illegal aliens to fly on commercial airliners inside the U.S.
[01:54:38.486 --> 01:54:40.709]  without verifiable identification.
[01:54:41.069 --> 01:54:46.796]  As long as the individual was able to produce a Notice to Appear form, they were allowed to board the plane.
[01:54:47.136 --> 01:54:57.679]  So clearly this means the TSA sees American mothers' breast milk as more of a terror threat than illegal aliens or people who are just crossing the border.
[01:54:57.719 --> 01:54:59.159]  They could be any kind of terrorist.
[01:54:59.219 --> 01:54:59.679]  Who knows?
[01:55:00.079 --> 01:55:02.380]  The message is loud and clear.
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.221]  No one is above the law.
[01:55:04.681 --> 01:55:05.841]  Unless you're an illegal alien.
[01:55:10.714 --> 01:55:11.875]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
