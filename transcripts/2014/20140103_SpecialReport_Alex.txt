[00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:13.298]  A study released by the Council on Foreign Relations suggests that out of the 3,520 people killed by U.S.
[00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:15.221]  drone strikes over the last 12 years, 457, or 11%, were civilians.
[00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:28.819]  But another monitoring organization suggests one out of every four drone strike victims are civilian.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.903]  The Bureau of Investigative Journalism thinks the deadliest attacks were in Pakistan alone, and claims that 3,091 people were killed there since 2004.
[00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:35.904]  And just over 680 were civilians.
[00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:36.424]  That's 22% of deaths.
[00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:49.952]  America has continually tried to downplay the collateral damage happening in Pakistan, and this is quite evident in that report released by the CFR.
[00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:54.635]  Actual figures are classified, so we may never have an accurate count of civilian deaths.
[00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:59.358]  But what we do know is that the Obama administration has no problem tinkering with the truth.
[00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:11.923]  CIA head and drone mastermind John Brennan said that in the last year there hadn't been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency, precision of the capabilities that we've been able to develop.
[00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:21.607]  A 2011 investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found at least 10 individual attacks in which 45 or more civilians appeared to have died.
[00:01:21.907 --> 00:01:26.889]  Policy Mike reported in 2012 that 50 civilians are killed for every one terrorist.
[00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:35.953]  Citing the controversial CIA double-tap policy, which deliberately targets those who show up after a drone strike, including rescuers and even funeral goers.
[00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:46.017]  We only authorize a particular operation against a specific individual if we have a high degree of confidence that the individual being targeted is indeed the terrorist we are pursuing.
[00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:51.738]  In fact, less than 2% of the targets in Pakistan since 2004 have been high-profile targets.
[00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:55.359]  The rest are children, civilians, and alleged combatants.
[00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:02.801]  One of those strategic drone strikes that the government likes to brag about took out an entire wedding party in Yemen by mistake.
[00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:12.163]  The president of I'm Really Good at Killing People cried crocodile tears for the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting while signing death orders to kill innocent children overseas.
[00:02:13.104 --> 00:02:13.804]  We're all parents.
[00:02:15.947 --> 00:02:16.947]  But they're all our children.
[00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.910]  This is our first task.
[00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.951]  Caring for our children.
[00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:29.793]  It's our first job.
[00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:33.855]  If we don't get that right, we don't get anything right.
[00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:38.617]  That's how, as a society, we will be judged.
[00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:43.619]  And by that measure,
[00:02:46.237 --> 00:02:51.504]  Can we truly say, as a nation, that we're meeting our obligations?
[00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:03.881]  Can we honestly say that we're doing enough to keep our children, all of them, safe from harm?
[00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:25.246]  And although President Obama has been harshly criticized for all of the secrecy surrounding the drone strike program, as well as what sort of criteria earns a terrorist a position on his kill list, this kill list, or the list of terrorism suspects whose assassinations President Obama personally authorizes, has been expanded and institutionalized.
[00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:34.868]  The institutionalization of the kill list means that no matter who is president, targeted drone strikes that are responsible for the deaths of scores of civilians will continue.
[00:03:35.268 --> 00:03:45.831]  And the problem with that is that drones are set to man the American skies en masse by 2015, and Congress hasn't even yet set the guidelines by which drones can target civilians here on American soil.
[00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:54.453]  I think we should all judge as inadequate the president's response when he says he hasn't killed Americans in America yet,
[00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:58.548]  He doesn't intend to, but that he might.
[00:03:59.428 --> 00:04:02.209]  I don't think that that is a response that we should tolerate.
[00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.511]  What are the criteria for who will be killed?
[00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:10.654]  The FAA announced December 30th the six states where drone testing will take place.
[00:04:11.094 --> 00:04:16.396]  The sites will be based in Alaska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Texas, and Virginia.
[00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:25.041]  On the Alex Jones Show, Sherry Tenpenny laid out a drone vaccine delivery program designed by Bill Gates to be forced upon the American people.
[00:04:25.549 --> 00:04:29.892]  You know how they're talking now about all these drones and like with Amazon delivering boxes?
[00:04:30.252 --> 00:04:42.299]  I just saw some kids at some university that just got funded by the Gates Foundation to develop a drone to deliver vaccines to locations where they can't get into with World Health Organization workers.
[00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:48.980]  Gates has been working for a while at this whole concept of a malaria vaccine with mosquitoes, delivering by mosquitoes.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.441]  Now, what if you get bit 10 times?
[00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:52.481]  Does that mean you get 10 doses of the vaccine?
[00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:54.622]  I mean, it's just insanity.
[00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:55.822]  I think about these pictures.
[00:04:56.202 --> 00:05:02.323]  You know, sometimes you have seen those pictures in the old days of Albert Einstein with the gray hair that's all messed up across his head.
[00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:05.744]  They just look like this wild, wild scientist.
[00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:15.716]  I think that there's this issue with technology, that because we can, the assumption is made that we should, when I think that in many cases, we should not.
[00:05:16.517 --> 00:05:23.446]  Given that in just a few years, drones are set to police the American skies, the question is, how long will they remain unarmed?
