[00:00:06.627 --> 00:00:17.492]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commons.
[00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:23.395]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:29.458]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:31.999]  It is a big idea.
[00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.060]  A new world order.
[00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:39.675]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:43.577]  It just panicked.
[00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:47.359]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:01:00.572 --> 00:01:06.157]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:11.415]  Guns will be taken.
[00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:12.516]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:14.377]  We're going to take all the guns.
[00:01:14.377 --> 00:01:19.180]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.761]  Global governance at last.
[00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.761]  Is it one world?
[00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:23.222]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:27.024]  But aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do?
[00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:33.307]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:38.010]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:43.688]  Not funny, clown!
[00:01:43.688 --> 00:01:50.882]  Here, blow that horn one more time and we'll shove it right up your... I'll kill you all!
[00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:53.463]  Ha ha!
[00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:56.065]  I'll drive you crazy and kill you all!
[00:01:56.065 --> 00:02:00.048]  Armed psychopathic clowns are becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
[00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:11.618]  42 years ago, John Wayne Gacy, a former Democratic Party member and psychopathic clown known as Pogo the Clown, stalked Chicago, Illinois from 1972 until 1978, killing at least 33 young men.
[00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:20.362]  All right, so you're going to say, hello?
[00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:28.287]  The latest rash of evil clowns was first spotted in September of 2013 in Northern Ireland in the seaside town of Carrick, Fergus.
[00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:38.053]  Two mysterious characters, one known as the Carrick Killer Clown and his sidekick, caused a disturbance when they were seen acting suspiciously near a secondary school.
[00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:38.893]  Hands up, clown!
[00:02:38.893 --> 00:02:39.714]  We've got you now!
[00:02:43.442 --> 00:02:48.347]  That incident inspired more clown mischief in California and New York.
[00:02:48.347 --> 00:02:55.494]  An independent film company out of Staten Island, New York created what appears to be a promotional campaign that went viral.
[00:02:55.494 --> 00:03:03.482]  It began with people linked to the production company utilizing social media to create a panic that a creepy clown was stalking the community.
[00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:07.146]  That viral social media ploy has spawned worldwide attention.
[00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:16.859]  Due to the popularity of American Horror Story freak shows, Twisty the Clown, and the popularity of scare prank YouTube videos that have netted tens of millions of viewers.
[00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:34.115]  Teenagers in France and Spain are now copycatting the viral videos.
[00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:41.037]  More than a dozen French teenagers armed with pistols, knives and baseball bats have been arrested for attacking people.
[00:03:41.037 --> 00:03:46.579]  One pedestrian in Montpellier, France was attacked by a killer clown wielding an iron bar.
[00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.562]  Now Spain's Gijon clown has arrived in the wee hours of the night.
[00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:59.327]  Spain has a youth unemployment rate of 56%, while France's youth unemployment rate is 26%.
[00:03:59.327 --> 00:04:12.475]  As the fabric of society is torn apart by corporate piracy and inadequate leadership, I would expect we will see a rise of killer clown attacks and the like by large portions of global society with nothing to lose.
[00:04:14.682 --> 00:04:25.811]  Teenagers in France were warned by the police not to take action against the killer clown.
[00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:32.176]  As the killer clown phenomenon grows, so does the killer clown vigilante phenomenon.
[00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:48.433]  Guys like that, you know?
[00:04:48.433 --> 00:05:01.257]  They give clowns a bad name.
[00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:07.899]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:13.040]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.501]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:27.945]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.051]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:43.853]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:50.978]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:57.642]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:57.642 --> 00:05:58.423]  Got it.
[00:05:58.423 --> 00:05:58.943]  Others don't.
[00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:01.896]  Another major health threat.
[00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:06.858]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:06:06.858 --> 00:06:09.559]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:16.582]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:06:16.582 --> 00:06:19.563]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:06:19.563 --> 00:06:22.604]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:06:22.604 --> 00:06:24.545]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:27.386]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:06:27.466 --> 00:06:33.188]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:06:33.188 --> 00:06:36.709]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.790]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:47.112]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:02.019]  The experts are clear.
[00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:09.123]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:07:09.123 --> 00:07:15.408]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:15.408 --> 00:07:18.990]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.333]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:28.656]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:29.676]  Not our iodine.
[00:07:29.676 --> 00:07:33.499]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:36.040]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:08:05.057 --> 00:08:09.201]  You could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.
[00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:10.803]  What do you mean, biblical?
[00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:13.246]  What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.
[00:08:13.246 --> 00:08:15.388]  Real wrath of God type stuff.
[00:08:15.388 --> 00:08:17.570]  Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
[00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.912]  Rivers and seas boiling.
[00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:19.913]  Forty years of darkness.
[00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:21.054]  Earthquakes, volcanoes.
[00:08:21.054 --> 00:08:22.616]  The dead rising from the grave.
[00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:23.817]  Human sacrifice.
[00:08:23.817 --> 00:08:25.699]  Dogs and cats living together.
[00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:26.560]  Mass hysteria!
[00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:38.005]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:40.107]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:08:40.107 --> 00:08:46.351]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:09.646]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:09:09.646 --> 00:09:13.248]  This is a breaking Ebola news update.
[00:09:14.099 --> 00:09:27.022]  In a moment I'm going to break down some very important developments where the World Health Organization itself is now saying that the incubation period is not just 21 days but can be up to 41 days.
[00:09:27.022 --> 00:09:37.505]  This was announced today as it was also announced that they are releasing dozens and dozens of quarantine Americans who are around patient zero in Dallas.
[00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:43.047]  Only after 21 days of observation.
[00:09:43.047 --> 00:09:54.791]  And as more flights come into the United States from West Africa, with people exhibiting signs of Ebola, it's clear that there is an attempt to whitewash and cover up exactly what's happening.
[00:09:54.791 --> 00:10:01.093]  But before we get into that, I want to just point out that InfoWars.com, The Nightly News, and everything we do here,
[00:10:02.273 --> 00:10:05.375]  Is about us trying to find out what's really happening.
[00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:13.762]  Not coming at you with a pre-set agenda or view like the controlled left or controlled right and the state-run media does.
[00:10:13.762 --> 00:10:16.264]  I want to know what's really happening with Ebola.
[00:10:16.264 --> 00:10:22.889]  I want to know if there are things out there that could protect this country and protect my three children, just as you do.
[00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:25.171]  We're teleprompter free here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:33.113]  This is about really doing the analysis, really talking to a wide spectrum of experts and not trusting the system.
[00:10:33.113 --> 00:10:34.133]  And that's the good news.
[00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.734]  There are several polls out just this week.
[00:10:36.734 --> 00:10:42.995]  Public confidence in the CDC nosedives CBS News reports in a major poll.
[00:10:42.995 --> 00:10:48.977]  Another story, 64% believe America is out of control.
[00:10:48.977 --> 00:10:53.038]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, America is getting more and more out of control.
[00:10:53.658 --> 00:11:00.620]  But the good news is when African leaders come out and say that this Ebola could be weaponized, people really aren't laughing anymore.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.561]  In fact, we have an article on InfoWars.com that has a BBC video in it.
[00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:15.645]  Secret project created weaponized Ebola in South Africa in the 1980s to be used against blacks to reduce their population.
[00:11:15.645 --> 00:11:22.847]  So the alternative media is now becoming the dominant media and we go out and source real facts and what's already admitted
[00:11:23.823 --> 00:11:32.887]  And the system calls us conspiracy theorists and attacks us in publications every day, and it has no effect other than boosting our credibility.
[00:11:32.887 --> 00:11:38.489]  The arrogant, dying dinosaur media still thinks that demonizing us is effective.
[00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:39.590]  It's not, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:47.816]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million people that have watched him on YouTube.
[00:11:47.816 --> 00:11:58.160]  And that sort of fringe, arch-conservative, deeply, I think, racist strain is being tapped into at crazy profit by people in the media.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.162]  Well it is, and I think that the point you just made is the key thing at Crazy Profit.
[00:12:02.162 --> 00:12:04.603]  These folks are getting paid to be racist.
[00:12:04.603 --> 00:12:07.704]  Now shifting to the potentially bad news.
[00:12:07.704 --> 00:12:08.944]  The breaking info.
[00:12:08.944 --> 00:12:10.445]  CNN today.
[00:12:10.445 --> 00:12:13.206]  UN staffer dies of Ebola.
[00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:17.728]  Monitoring ends for 43 in Texas.
[00:12:17.728 --> 00:12:27.332]  43 people who came in contact with Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan are now officially cleared after not demonstrating any symptoms during a 21 day monitoring period.
[00:12:28.172 --> 00:12:29.033]  Here's the problem.
[00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:35.256]  The UN on its own World Health Organization website and other mainline virology sites state the same fact.
[00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:44.962]  They say that Ebola can easily live for 41 days in the body and 70 days in the semen in a man's testicles.
[00:12:44.962 --> 00:12:50.325]  So they are releasing people who are around this Ebola patient and he's already infected two nurses.
[00:12:51.348 --> 00:12:56.111]  Who could not exhibit signs for another 21 days?
[00:12:56.111 --> 00:13:01.274]  And this fits into the pattern of bringing in the West African flights when other nations ban it.
[00:13:01.274 --> 00:13:07.058]  When they're putting Ebola patients in regular hospitals and the CDC told one of the nurses
[00:13:07.358 --> 00:13:10.180]  Doesn't matter if you treated an Ebola patient and you've got fever.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.941]  Go ahead and fly, honey.
[00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:24.551]  This is part of a pattern of trying to let Ebola get a foothold in this country so the CDC, FEMA and NORTHCOM can engage in a giant domestic power grab of medical tyranny.
[00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:30.595]  The feds have been buying millions of firearms, billions of bullets and other forms of ammunition.
[00:13:30.595 --> 00:13:36.400]  They've been buying huge armored vehicles and deploying them in every city and digging in for biological catastrophe.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.384]  I don't know if this Ebola event is that.
[00:13:40.384 --> 00:13:45.551]  What I do know is they're making preparations while telling us that we shouldn't be prepared.
[00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:55.443]  Just like they tell us we shouldn't own guns, even though the highest crime rates are in Chicago, New York, and D.C., where they have an abolition of the individual's right to keep and bear arms.
[00:13:55.743 --> 00:13:58.045]  Well, I personally am getting prepared.
[00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:04.650]  I saw them take the guns in Katrina and raid the houses of people that had their own solar power and were high and dry.
[00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:13.817]  I witnessed people a few years ago with a hurricane that hit the East Coast begging for FEMA to help them and getting zero help for week after week after week.
[00:14:15.034 --> 00:14:22.360]  And who could forget that famous sign that FEMA hung on their door saying we're closed because of bad weather.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.585]  I'm not sitting back waiting for the government to come protect me and take care of me.
[00:14:27.585 --> 00:14:29.907]  They've shown time and time again they have
[00:14:30.547 --> 00:14:35.030]  Very bad intent and bad will against the people, not good will.
[00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:43.195]  They want crises to get out of control so they can pose as the saviors and sell their toxic vaccines and other poisons as a solution.
[00:14:43.195 --> 00:14:49.899]  Well, I'm personally getting my body ready with plenty of sunshine, organic food, purified water.
[00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:57.163]  Myself and my family are taking high quality colloidal silver from Infowarslife.com, the silver bullet.
[00:14:57.543 --> 00:15:04.919]  I'm taking Survival Shield X2, true nascent iodine, that I believe is even more important than things like loyal silver.
[00:15:04.919 --> 00:15:06.643]  Because if you don't have iodine in your body...
[00:15:07.526 --> 00:15:09.968]  If you're deficient in it, you will die.
[00:15:09.968 --> 00:15:17.613]  It's something you've got to absolutely have, so governments keep lowering and lowering the allowance they claim that we need.
[00:15:17.613 --> 00:15:19.714]  This needs to be looked into, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:19.714 --> 00:15:21.075]  We've been investigating it.
[00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:29.401]  It's why I'm doing everything I can to boost my body's natural defenses, and why I'm trying to warn people that they can't have confidence in the system.
[00:15:29.401 --> 00:15:33.884]  But at the same time, we shouldn't just sit here and wait for things to spiral out of control.
[00:15:33.884 --> 00:15:37.106]  None of this, in the final equation, is a silver bullet.
[00:15:37.526 --> 00:15:47.074]  Nothing is perfect, but just laying there and being horrified and watching mainstream media deceive us and scare us is not going to do a damn thing.
[00:15:47.074 --> 00:15:50.978]  We all need to get involved and do our own research.
[00:15:50.978 --> 00:15:54.080]  So don't stand behind us, stand right beside us.
[00:15:54.841 --> 00:16:03.645]  Looking at every angle of this, researching what's really happening, and understanding that there is clearly a cover-up going on with this Ebola situation.
[00:16:03.645 --> 00:16:09.687]  Now, I've said many times, I don't think this Ebola will probably really get out of hand here in the United States.
[00:16:09.687 --> 00:16:12.588]  Even if the Feds try everything they can to let it spread.
[00:16:12.588 --> 00:16:18.271]  But in Africa, the UN is saying it could be up to 1.4 million people or more that end up getting it.
[00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:22.032]  That is just an incredible number.
[00:16:22.032 --> 00:16:30.374]  What I'm really concerned about is the MRSA and the drug-resistant bacteria and the drug immune TB that is spreading across this country.
[00:16:30.374 --> 00:16:32.234]  The flesh-eating bacteria.
[00:16:32.234 --> 00:16:48.138]  That's why it's essential for all of us going into this flu season to do our own research and find out that the H1N1 shot five years ago lowered people's immune systems and doubled their chances of getting the regular flu that was the big killer.
[00:16:48.658 --> 00:16:57.886]  That's why it's vital going into this winter that we all wash our hands and boost our immune systems however we can naturally.
[00:16:57.886 --> 00:17:02.269]  Well, that's it for this Emergency Ebola News Update Alert.
[00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:06.613]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for this edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:17:06.613 --> 00:17:07.814]  We don't have all the answers.
[00:17:08.174 --> 00:17:20.033]  But we know the Feds and the Globalist and the UN, the people caught doing secret, lethal medical testing all over the world, we know that that's a group that we are certainly going to keep an eye on.
[00:17:21.015 --> 00:17:22.677]  All right, that's Alex Jones' special report.
[00:17:22.677 --> 00:17:26.901]  I'm David Knight on this October 31st, 2014 edition.
[00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:30.345]  This is Halloween, and Alex is going to be joining us live.
[00:17:30.345 --> 00:17:35.230]  We had a report at the very beginning of the show, John Bowne's killer clowns report.
[00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.112]  If you haven't seen that, you need to see that.
[00:17:37.112 --> 00:17:40.375]  It's got some great visuals in it, and it's up on our YouTube channel now.
[00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:41.456]  Of course, this is Halloween.
[00:17:42.257 --> 00:17:48.920]  And I knew that this clown thing with the French and their mimes is going to break bad, but this is getting out of hand in France.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.501]  Of course, there's a lot of other things behind that, and John breaks that down.
[00:17:52.501 --> 00:18:00.465]  Now we also have up on the Drudge Report, one of our contest entrants actually made the paper in Illinois.
[00:18:01.045 --> 00:18:12.034]  They didn't report the fact that it was an InfoWars contest, but the man going around in a hazmat suit and an Obama mask hanging Ebola posters made the local news and that made Drudge Report.
[00:18:12.034 --> 00:18:14.576]  So that's up on the Drudge Report.
[00:18:14.576 --> 00:18:19.860]  A man in Obama mask and a hazmat suit hangs Ebola posters across Chicago.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.723]  And of course we have other breaking Ebola news.
[00:18:22.723 --> 00:18:25.485]  They're now scrubbed the information about how you can catch
[00:18:26.426 --> 00:18:30.194]  Ebola from coughing and sneezing with the aerosol particles.
[00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:31.958]  That was up on the CDC website.
[00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.381]  That's now been scrubbed.
[00:18:34.144 --> 00:18:36.105]  They keep changing that information.
[00:18:36.105 --> 00:18:39.267]  They want to make sure that we don't have a panic.
[00:18:39.267 --> 00:18:42.308]  But this is going far, far beyond that.
[00:18:42.308 --> 00:18:54.114]  As a matter of fact, just look at this nurse who yesterday went for a ride in defiance of people's wishes and the requests of the Maine governor that she stay away from the public.
[00:18:54.114 --> 00:18:56.855]  She went for a bicycle ride and she did that in defiance.
[00:18:56.855 --> 00:18:58.896]  And they didn't have a court order at the time.
[00:18:58.896 --> 00:19:02.218]  Now they do have a court order to keep her from doing that.
[00:19:02.798 --> 00:19:08.022]  Now, I think it's really amazing that a doctor, that a nurse would do this type of thing.
[00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:21.832]  But of course, she also doesn't just have connections to Doctors Without Borders, which we just had a Doctor Without Borders doctor who had Ebola, who lied about the fact that he went around New York until they found his credit card records.
[00:19:22.432 --> 00:19:23.873]  He did not do self-quarantine.
[00:19:23.873 --> 00:19:25.974]  He did not put other people's interests first.
[00:19:25.974 --> 00:19:29.136]  He did not follow the maxim that doctors are supposed to follow.
[00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:30.957]  First, do no harm.
[00:19:30.957 --> 00:19:32.959]  And of course, neither is she.
[00:19:32.959 --> 00:19:36.101]  She has deep ties to the CDC.
[00:19:36.101 --> 00:19:40.123]  And we see with her that voluntary quarantine is not going to work.
[00:19:40.123 --> 00:19:43.125]  Why would she model this kind of dangerous behavior?
[00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:46.867]  The same questions that we had about Judge Jenkins in Dallas.
[00:19:46.867 --> 00:19:47.468]  Stay with us.
[00:19:47.468 --> 00:19:48.968]  Alex Jones is going to be live.
[00:19:48.968 --> 00:19:49.589]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:03.723]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:20:03.723 --> 00:20:08.025]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:20:08.025 --> 00:20:09.426]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:20:09.426 --> 00:20:12.107]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[00:20:12.107 --> 00:20:15.109]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:17.450]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.351]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:24.913]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:20:24.913 --> 00:20:28.555]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[00:20:28.715 --> 00:20:30.776]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:20:30.776 --> 00:20:33.878]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:20:33.878 --> 00:20:38.140]  Civil unrest, riots, looting, it's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.741]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:20:39.741 --> 00:20:41.682]  If passed, H.R.
[00:20:41.682 --> 00:20:44.103]  5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.
[00:20:44.103 --> 00:20:46.264]  Katie Armor is standing up for you.
[00:20:46.264 --> 00:20:49.386]  We offer the most affordable level 3 body armor on the market.
[00:20:49.386 --> 00:20:53.808]  Katie Level 3 Armor withstands pistol and rifle hits up to 7.62 NATO.

[00:21:16.676 --> 00:21:23.362]  Keeping your colon clean is preventative maintenance, a little exercise, a balanced diet, and drinking life-change tea.
[00:21:23.362 --> 00:21:29.948]  It tastes great, and it helps with constipation, high cholesterol, liver problems, acid reflux, and much, much more.
[00:21:29.948 --> 00:21:34.712]  And with the holiday season upon us, you can get some extra tea for free!
[00:21:34.712 --> 00:21:36.114]  Don't wait for Obama.
[00:21:36.114 --> 00:21:37.595]  Make your own decision.
[00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:38.356]  Order now.

[00:21:39.997 --> 00:21:40.457]  I think so.
[00:21:59.326 --> 00:22:03.987]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[00:22:03.987 --> 00:22:16.330]  This, combined with several other unidentified viruses, have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:26.293]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell

[00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:06.283]  We need assistance.
[00:23:06.283 --> 00:23:07.103]  Please!
[00:23:07.103 --> 00:23:10.686]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:23:10.686 --> 00:23:16.792]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:19.594]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:23:46.776 --> 00:23:51.542]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[00:23:51.542 --> 00:23:55.928]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com
[00:24:09.173 --> 00:24:12.796]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[00:24:12.796 --> 00:24:18.320]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.943]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:24:22.943 --> 00:24:28.107]  Everybody knows... Well, it's All Saints' Eve, or I guess they call it Halloween.
[00:24:28.107 --> 00:24:30.769]  Shaolin, Samhain, a lot of different names for it.
[00:24:32.244 --> 00:24:42.548]  The big occult holiday is upon us and we're seeing all sorts of good things happening, all sorts of bad things happening, obviously.
[00:24:42.548 --> 00:24:46.470]  I had a family issue I had to deal with so I'm here a little bit late.
[00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.191]  I was actually here once the show started but had to get ready.
[00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:52.552]  Appreciate David Knight filling in for me.
[00:24:52.552 --> 00:24:54.612]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:54.612 --> 00:24:58.613]  And of course, we also have some special reports that we premiered here.
[00:24:58.613 --> 00:25:14.556]  We have a lengthy special report that's about 20 minutes long that Rob Dew did that will air today if we have time, dealing with what's worse, what's more poisonous than the Halloween candy with the high fructose corn syrup filled with lead and mercury and more.
[00:25:14.556 --> 00:25:15.616]  So that's coming up.
[00:25:15.616 --> 00:25:18.677]  We also have Dr. Joseph Mercola,
[00:25:19.797 --> 00:25:28.442]  He's a medical doctor, but one of the leading, if not the leading voice out there, exposing what's happening with Big Pharma and more.
[00:25:28.442 --> 00:25:33.604]  He's going to give us his real take on the Ebola situation in the third hour today.
[00:25:33.604 --> 00:25:37.986]  We're going to cover a lot of other news, obviously, in the meantime.
[00:25:37.986 --> 00:25:45.090]  It was two, three days ago, back on October 29th, that listeners sent us a link to the CDC's website.
[00:25:46.997 --> 00:25:53.299]  Showing that the last month they had gone from saying Ebola couldn't be airborne to saying it could be airborne.
[00:25:53.299 --> 00:25:57.880]  And then the New York Post and others picked it up within a few hours.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:06.802]  So now Gateway Pundits reporting today CDC deletes Ebola page on how you can catch disease from coughing and sneezing.
[00:26:06.802 --> 00:26:15.764]  The Army's own manuals, the CDC, the World Health Organization, they're all on record saying it can travel 3 to 20 feet in hot weather.
[00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:25.397]  But that if it gets into cold weather, it can live weeks on surfaces.
[00:26:25.397 --> 00:26:26.358]  Weeks.
[00:26:26.358 --> 00:26:28.260]  And travel miles.
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.701]  So that's the truth.
[00:26:29.701 --> 00:26:41.293]  And that's why people that have done research, the virologists, the epidemiologists, the experts we've had on, and I've done my own layman research of the medical reports out there because I've got three children.
[00:26:45.646 --> 00:27:10.844]  That if you get this flu season going with a bunch of compromised immune systems, that's why flu season is in the winter because the virus can live longer in the cold, just like Ebola, and people aren't getting sun so their immune systems aren't up and they're all cooped up inside, and you run out of vitamin D because you're not in the sun within about two months of not having sun, and boom!
[00:27:12.591 --> 00:27:17.154]  You don't have vitamin D, you don't have vitamin B12, you get the flu.
[00:27:17.154 --> 00:27:20.697]  Well, if Ebola gets into the U.S.
[00:27:20.697 --> 00:27:29.384]  and starts spreading during the flu season, then you'll have people incubating it who don't know they have it, walking around for 40 plus days.
[00:27:29.384 --> 00:27:34.447]  It's now 40 plus days, not 21 in some cases.
[00:27:34.447 --> 00:27:36.469]  And it will spread very rapidly.
[00:27:38.103 --> 00:27:39.265]  That's why I'm concerned.
[00:27:39.265 --> 00:27:50.901]  Then you add the government lying about the whole thing and doing everything they can, like we reported last week in that special report you heard earlier.
[00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:52.484]  If you add into that equation
[00:27:54.770 --> 00:28:05.021]  The cold weather and the rest of it and the government not responding properly and violating their own default to screen people at the border to shut down the visas from West Africa.
[00:28:05.021 --> 00:28:07.403]  Something all the African countries have done.
[00:28:07.403 --> 00:28:08.545]  Something Europe has done.
[00:28:08.545 --> 00:28:10.026]  Something the Middle East has done.
[00:28:10.026 --> 00:28:11.127]  Something Asia's done.
[00:28:11.127 --> 00:28:12.469]  Something Australia's done.
[00:28:12.469 --> 00:28:14.371]  Something Colombia's done.
[00:28:14.371 --> 00:28:16.233]  Something a bunch of Caribbean islands have done.
[00:28:18.749 --> 00:28:23.054]  You know why those Caribbean islands, the ones that have put the travel ban on?
[00:28:23.054 --> 00:28:25.356]  They're mainly black islands.
[00:28:25.356 --> 00:28:30.381]  And black folks know AIDS and Ebola is race specific.
[00:28:30.381 --> 00:28:36.428]  So Caribbean islands run by black people are shutting down people coming in and out of West Africa.
[00:28:36.428 --> 00:28:40.091]  And it's not because they don't like black people.
[00:28:40.091 --> 00:28:41.473]  It's because they don't want to die.
[00:28:42.642 --> 00:28:54.045]  Now Ebola can kill white people, but it clearly, and I've had medical doctors on and scientists and former CIA and bioweapons treaty authors, it is race-specific.
[00:28:54.045 --> 00:29:05.388]  We can say that and we can air a BBC, you know, a documentary that aired on the BBC, it was declassified in the mid-90s, that South Africa created airborne, race-specific Ebola for Africans.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:16.846]  And our own Pentagon had to kill a bunch of monkeys in 89 where airborne Ebola started spreading in Virginia.
[00:29:16.846 --> 00:29:21.990]  Do I need to air the NOVA special again or the BBC piece again?
[00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.872]  Because mainstream media attacks us and says we're making this up.
[00:29:24.872 --> 00:29:26.333]  We're not making any of this up.
[00:29:26.333 --> 00:29:28.595]  They're just preying on people's ignorance.
[00:29:28.595 --> 00:29:29.355]  Well, here's the problem.
[00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:31.076]  People aren't as ignorant as they used to be.
[00:29:31.076 --> 00:29:32.878]  So coming up, the latest on Ebola quickly.
[00:29:32.878 --> 00:29:34.099]  Then, early voting.
[00:29:34.099 --> 00:29:36.080]  Drudge reports Republicans have a 10% lead.
[00:29:37.461 --> 00:29:47.533]  We're going to be looking today and Sunday and the next week at how many of these are good libertarian style republicans and how many are neocon, rhino republicans.
[00:29:47.533 --> 00:29:49.736]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:29:49.736 --> 00:29:53.660]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.364]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.059 --> 00:30:10.703]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[00:30:10.703 --> 00:30:20.628]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:20.628 --> 00:30:23.549]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:30:23.769 --> 00:30:24.390]  I think so.
[00:30:38.883 --> 00:30:39.243]  We're good.
[00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:04.993]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:31:04.993 --> 00:31:09.274]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:31:09.274 --> 00:31:11.035]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:18.898]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:31:18.898 --> 00:31:20.039]  But for how long?
[00:31:20.039 --> 00:31:26.682]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:31:26.682 --> 00:31:29.503]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:31:30.956 --> 00:31:41.524]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:31:41.524 --> 00:31:47.969]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:31:47.969 --> 00:31:50.531]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:31:50.531 --> 00:31:53.413]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:31:53.413 --> 00:32:00.278]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:32:00.578 --> 00:32:02.519]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:07.042]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:32:07.042 --> 00:32:11.525]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:32:11.525 --> 00:32:18.829]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:32:18.829 --> 00:32:27.915]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:28.115 --> 00:32:33.657]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:32:33.657 --> 00:32:41.261]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[00:32:41.261 --> 00:32:43.822]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:32:43.822 --> 00:32:48.944]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Info War.

[00:32:54.233 --> 00:32:55.275]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:33:16.621 --> 00:33:19.282]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:33:19.282 --> 00:33:25.084]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:25.084 --> 00:33:29.746]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:29.746 --> 00:33:31.487]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:33:31.487 --> 00:33:33.148]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.148 --> 00:33:35.829]  I will be here this Sunday live.
[00:33:37.388 --> 00:33:38.088]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:38.088 --> 00:33:42.110]  Central Time as well as we go into Election 2014.
[00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.871]  One of the most political elections we've ever seen.
[00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:47.332]  One of the dirtiest elections we've ever seen.
[00:33:47.332 --> 00:33:49.253]  Incredible race baiting going on.
[00:33:49.253 --> 00:33:52.474]  And one of the most critically important we've ever seen.
[00:33:52.474 --> 00:33:56.196]  Because even if a lot of these Republicans that are about to be voted in are globalists...
[00:33:57.421 --> 00:34:08.270]  The amount of anger and the major political realignment that this signifies with early voting numbers coming out showing Republicans have a 10% lead.
[00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:09.151]  That's a big deal.
[00:34:09.151 --> 00:34:13.394]  We're going to be breaking that down coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:13.394 --> 00:34:16.998]  First off, though, I don't want her within three feet of anyone.
[00:34:16.998 --> 00:34:24.324]  Governor threatens to arrest Ebola nurse after she defied quarantine to go for a bike ride and order pizza.
[00:34:26.354 --> 00:34:30.838]  So, they're arresting people that defy quarantine in Africa.
[00:34:30.838 --> 00:34:37.944]  They're not bringing people into other African countries that have treated Ebola patients, or who have it, until they pass quarantine.
[00:34:37.944 --> 00:34:40.867]  But here, we can't do that.
[00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:49.515]  And this nurse, who it turns out worked for the CDC, is so arrogant and going on the news via Skype all over the place, saying she'll do whatever she wants.
[00:34:52.318 --> 00:34:58.262]  What happens when other people come in contact with Ebola patients and perhaps have it, and then they decide to just run around?
[00:34:58.262 --> 00:35:05.006]  Why did this other nurse in Dallas treating Ebola patients get sick and call the CDC and they said, go ahead and fly?
[00:35:05.006 --> 00:35:08.688]  And then she had Ebola, and Lord knows what she did on that airplane.
[00:35:08.688 --> 00:35:11.530]  The stuff spreads through the air.
[00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.191]  The CDC admits that.
[00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:17.394]  National News pointed it out, so they pulled that off their website today.
[00:35:19.352 --> 00:35:23.234]  Maine Governor vows to use full extent of authority on Ebola nurse.
[00:35:23.234 --> 00:35:39.442]  Maine Governor, LePage, vowed last night to use the full extent of his authority in response to a nurse who has treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone after she left her home in Maine and took a bicycle ride despite a quarantine order.
[00:35:39.442 --> 00:35:46.286]  LePage and his office had been in talks overnight Wednesday to work out a legal deal for the nurse
[00:35:47.674 --> 00:35:50.156]  Who has tested negative for Ebola.
[00:35:50.156 --> 00:36:00.887]  Will spend the remaining time until November 10th, the period that the state has ordered her to remain at her home as she waits out the virus minimum 21 day incubation period.
[00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:08.491]  Here's another headline out of France 24.
[00:36:08.491 --> 00:36:09.852]  Flu or Ebola?
[00:36:09.852 --> 00:36:10.152]  U.S.
[00:36:10.152 --> 00:36:12.754]  hospitals prepare for a confusing season.
[00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:15.056]  Yes, this is what's going to add to the panic.
[00:36:15.056 --> 00:36:23.721]  And then we have the confirmed reports from doctors and border patrol that people are being disappeared that appear to have Ebola.
[00:36:23.721 --> 00:36:24.802]  We don't know they have Ebola.
[00:36:24.802 --> 00:36:27.544]  What we know is they are being disappeared.
[00:36:27.544 --> 00:36:33.087]  The hospitals that we fingered will not respond, will not deny.
[00:36:33.087 --> 00:36:33.688]  What's that tell you?
[00:36:34.551 --> 00:36:37.713]  And we talked to the doctor that blew the whistle up in Missouri.
[00:36:37.713 --> 00:36:44.536]  He talks to the doctors and the nurses there at the Harry Truman Center and they go, no, it's all true, you're absolutely right, but we're scared.
[00:36:44.536 --> 00:36:49.919]  And then at the hospitals that he runs, he's been totally ostracized.
[00:36:49.919 --> 00:36:53.601]  Doctors, nurses won't even talk to him.
[00:36:53.601 --> 00:36:59.383]  All because he did his Hippocratic oath and said, hey, they're disappearing people in the middle of the night.
[00:36:59.383 --> 00:37:02.265]  And then we confirmed it from a major Dallas doctor.
[00:37:04.657 --> 00:37:26.082]  You add to that our exclusive story that a major shipping company is delivering with 18 wheelers as we speak from their cash on the East Coast a quarter million thousand plus dollar hazmat suits to the DFW area, Dallas-Fort Worth area.
[00:37:26.082 --> 00:37:28.563]  Quarter million.
[00:37:28.563 --> 00:37:30.043]  Quarter million.
[00:37:30.043 --> 00:37:33.224]  And they admit they've ordered over a million total.
[00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:42.497]  And then Obama comes out yesterday, we played the clip twice, and says there may be more Ebola cases.
[00:37:42.497 --> 00:37:44.339]  Just get ready for that.
[00:37:44.339 --> 00:37:48.382]  So they're waiting till after the election to announce more Ebola cases.
[00:37:48.382 --> 00:37:52.606]  I think it's overwhelmingly clear.
[00:37:52.606 --> 00:37:58.071]  Or they may be able to cover it up with the people they've been snatching.
[00:37:58.071 --> 00:37:59.233]  But regardless
[00:38:00.876 --> 00:38:08.201]  of this being real Ebola or panicking by the government, it should be a news item that people are disappearing.
[00:38:08.201 --> 00:38:10.342]  That's the kind of thing you get a Pulitzer Prize for.
[00:38:10.342 --> 00:38:11.483]  Where's the New York Times?
[00:38:11.483 --> 00:38:12.904]  Where's the Washington Post?
[00:38:12.904 --> 00:38:20.609]  Well, the fire departments, the police departments around the country were told two months ago, do not use the word Ebola over the radio.
[00:38:20.609 --> 00:38:24.012]  Hospitals were told, don't tell anybody if there's an Ebola case.
[00:38:24.012 --> 00:38:26.353]  So see, that's how the secrecy begins.
[00:38:26.353 --> 00:38:30.076]  And then, oh, don't tell anybody we bring an Ebola patient here.
[00:38:31.553 --> 00:38:38.278]  And then the CDC puts out on their website, oh yes, it is airborne up to three feet.
[00:38:38.278 --> 00:38:40.519]  They take that down.
[00:38:40.519 --> 00:38:42.641]  So what you have is a cover-up.
[00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:52.928]  We know a cover-up's going on, we know some of what they're covering up, but we're about an inch deep in what I think is a very, very deep reservoir that we have to swim down to the bottom of to find out what's happening.
[00:38:55.404 --> 00:38:59.785]  And I never claimed that we were the total cutting edge of so-called journalism.
[00:38:59.785 --> 00:39:04.207]  What I do is just go off research, analysis, and what's already known.
[00:39:04.207 --> 00:39:09.648]  What is publicly available, public intelligence.
[00:39:09.648 --> 00:39:15.990]  Meanwhile, Breitbart's reporting Spanish intelligence has intercepted a plot to weaponize Ebola.
[00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.910]  Well, no kidding.
[00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:20.071]  I mean, what do you think ISIS and others are going to do?
[00:39:20.071 --> 00:39:22.472]  They're going to try to go into hospitals where people have Ebola.
[00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:29.473]  Or they're going to try to go to these African countries, get sick, start incubating, and get on airplanes.
[00:39:29.473 --> 00:39:43.237]  But they don't need to, because we have the doctor in New York, now the police have said he's a liar, and that he did get on the subway in the most busy time of day, and he went to restaurants and bowling alleys and taxicabs.
[00:39:43.237 --> 00:39:45.398]  Gee, oh by the way, when he was sick,
[00:39:46.603 --> 00:40:04.556]  You're a medical doctor, you come back from Doctors Without Borders, a known CIA front, though they do some real work, some of the doctors in there aren't agents, and he returns back and then just starts racing around everywhere he can when he has a fever.
[00:40:04.556 --> 00:40:08.919]  And now they say he's moved into stage 2, that's the bleeding and the rest of it.
[00:40:08.919 --> 00:40:12.001]  Ebola doctor lied about New York City travels, New York Post.
[00:40:13.582 --> 00:40:15.183]  That's according to the NYPD.
[00:40:15.183 --> 00:40:20.626]  So we're seeing a real pattern here of these nurses and doctors just running around doing whatever they want.
[00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:23.548]  Is there one nurse that isn't running around?
[00:40:23.548 --> 00:40:27.530]  Is there one doctor that isn't running around?
[00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:36.755]  Will we catch one of these doctors next to the playground spitting on the monkey bars where kids are swinging?
[00:40:36.755 --> 00:40:39.277]  It seems like they're going over the top.
[00:40:41.718 --> 00:40:43.840]  To spread this.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.141]  Or maybe they just don't care.
[00:40:45.141 --> 00:40:46.422]  Maybe they're just stupid.
[00:40:46.422 --> 00:40:48.784]  Maybe they're just dumb.
[00:40:48.784 --> 00:40:50.665]  Or maybe they're not really sick.
[00:40:50.665 --> 00:40:52.087]  Maybe this is a psyop.
[00:40:52.087 --> 00:40:53.488]  I mean, there's real Ebola in Africa.
[00:40:53.488 --> 00:40:55.209]  Clearly it's a real disease.
[00:40:55.209 --> 00:41:00.494]  Clearly there's mystery illnesses with hundreds of kids dying every month now.
[00:41:00.494 --> 00:41:03.957]  Tens of hundreds on respirators.
[00:41:03.957 --> 00:41:07.219]  Just all sorts of bizarre deaths all over the place.
[00:41:07.219 --> 00:41:08.600]  And the media is so controlled,
[00:41:09.471 --> 00:41:14.633]  Like the three monkeys, see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, that pretty much anything could go on.
[00:41:14.633 --> 00:41:21.296]  That's when I got concerned in January of this year, when in a two month period, I'd lost three family members.
[00:41:21.296 --> 00:41:27.319]  And the doctors and nurses at the big medical center, they're in Tyler, Texas.
[00:41:30.865 --> 00:41:33.367]  We're telling me no, it's some kind of mystery illness.
[00:41:33.367 --> 00:41:51.022]  It's a combination of resistant viruses and just regular bacteria that just can't be killed and all sorts of other weird stuff and it's a cocktail and there are just people dying all over the place and we can't take more people and all the other hospitals can't take more people and you find little local news articles here and there around the country.
[00:41:51.022 --> 00:41:54.565]  Mystery illness causes four deaths at the hospital this week.
[00:41:54.565 --> 00:41:56.267]  Next week, mystery illness claims ten more.
[00:41:57.941 --> 00:42:01.462]  Introvirus D-68 or flu.
[00:42:01.462 --> 00:42:03.043]  How do you know what your child has?
[00:42:03.043 --> 00:42:04.503]  Flu questions of the week.
[00:42:04.503 --> 00:42:11.846]  Well, when you go into most doctor's offices now, this has happened to me repeatedly with pediatricians.
[00:42:11.846 --> 00:42:18.809]  I've gone to different places and because the guy I had was really good, but he retired.
[00:42:18.809 --> 00:42:18.909]  And
[00:42:20.168 --> 00:42:22.309]  I'll say, yeah, my child has 101 fever and everything.
[00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:23.710]  I'll just kind of look down their throat and everything.
[00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:25.391]  Okay, here's some antibiotics.
[00:42:25.391 --> 00:42:26.932]  Here's a prescription.
[00:42:26.932 --> 00:42:28.653]  And I go, wait a minute.
[00:42:28.653 --> 00:42:39.179]  When I go to the clinic that I go to, because the guy's friends with my dad, well, it's a big clinic, but the owners are friends with my dad, so I know it's a good place.
[00:42:39.179 --> 00:42:40.560]  My dad said it was a great place and it has been.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.881]  I've been going there for like 15 years.
[00:42:42.881 --> 00:42:44.562]  They don't give me antibiotics.
[00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:45.963]  They make me cough in a cup.
[00:42:47.213 --> 00:42:55.060]  Or they swabbed my leg when I had an infection, and then I had to wait a day in excruciating pain, and they called back and said, this is what it is.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:43:03.207]  You've got two drug-resistant bacteria, one strep and one staph, and we're going to put you on two different hardcore antibiotics.
[00:43:03.207 --> 00:43:04.468]  Don't drink when you're on these.
[00:43:04.468 --> 00:43:06.049]  These will hurt your liver.
[00:43:06.049 --> 00:43:07.430]  But this stuff's so hard to knock out.
[00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.891]  Are you ready?
[00:43:10.683 --> 00:43:14.947]  You don't give people antibiotics, ladies and gentlemen, without testing and finding out.
[00:43:14.947 --> 00:43:16.929]  It's pointless when you got a virus.
[00:43:16.929 --> 00:43:23.935]  And people said, oh, it's racism that the first Ebola patient who knew he had Ebola and ran over here and gave it to people in Dallas.
[00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:25.076]  Remember Jesse Jackson?
[00:43:25.076 --> 00:43:29.220]  No responsibility, it's just racism.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.021]  You rob a bank, it's racism.
[00:43:31.021 --> 00:43:32.543]  You mug somebody, it's racism.
[00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:33.864]  Everything is somebody else's fault.
[00:43:36.715 --> 00:43:39.957]  Well, he went into the hospital and they didn't even test him.
[00:43:39.957 --> 00:43:41.978]  They just said, oh, here's some antibiotics.
[00:43:41.978 --> 00:43:42.958]  And he had Ebola.
[00:43:42.958 --> 00:43:46.000]  But that wasn't, like Jesse Jackson said, because they were racist.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.482]  It's because they're inept and they don't care at most of these facilities.
[00:43:50.482 --> 00:43:52.723]  That's what's going on.
[00:43:52.723 --> 00:43:55.584]  And you know, Jesse Jackson's right in a way.
[00:43:55.584 --> 00:44:04.669]  This Ebola patient, patient zero, you notice he's the only one that's died of all these white doctors they're bringing in here.
[00:44:09.858 --> 00:44:12.240]  Thomas Eric Duncan.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.961]  That was his name.
[00:44:13.961 --> 00:44:17.003]  He's the only person that's died here of Ebola.
[00:44:17.003 --> 00:44:21.005]  70% of people that get it die in Africa, sometimes 90%.
[00:44:21.005 --> 00:44:22.847]  But the only person that's died is a black guy.
[00:44:22.847 --> 00:44:30.191]  If I was a black folks out there, I would be really concerned about this Ebola.
[00:44:30.191 --> 00:44:32.493]  There have been a lot of white folks die from it.
[00:44:32.493 --> 00:44:38.417]  But if you look at the numbers, maybe 20%, which is still an incredible kill rate, but
[00:44:40.259 --> 00:44:43.641]  If you're black, in fact we have a lot of new listeners and people probably don't believe it.
[00:44:43.641 --> 00:44:58.590]  Will you queue up that documentary and we'll show the article from the mid-90s when they declassified that they've developed airborne weaponized Ebola and other race-specific bioweapons and they have the doctors that get it, the heads of Project Coast, on there doing the interview.
[00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.392]  This is completely declassified.
[00:45:01.392 --> 00:45:02.473]  But I'm sick of
[00:45:05.265 --> 00:45:15.133]  Hundreds of publications, CBS News, MSNBC, Salon, Raw Story, all of them.
[00:45:15.133 --> 00:45:19.837]  That's right, 60 Minutes even did a piece on it.
[00:45:19.837 --> 00:45:22.499]  Dr. Death and his accomplice.
[00:45:26.186 --> 00:45:34.351]  But let's go ahead and play this clip dealing with weaponized viruses and bacteria for black people.
[00:45:34.351 --> 00:45:35.852]  So let's just get this out in the open.
[00:45:35.852 --> 00:45:36.492]  This is going on.
[00:45:36.492 --> 00:45:37.693]  Here it is.
[00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:38.954]  Larry was a wonderful fellow.
[00:45:38.954 --> 00:45:40.275]  Mad as a hatter.
[00:45:40.275 --> 00:45:52.863]  He used to rock up in South Africa having flown intercontinental flights with a trousers pocket full of goodies in sealed vials that he claimed were new and wonderful organisms and could do the most wonderful things on earth.
[00:45:56.238 --> 00:46:05.741]  Larry Ford had mutated cholera, typhoid, anthrax, botulism, bubonic plague, and had also come up with germs that he called kaffir-killing germs.
[00:46:05.741 --> 00:46:11.522]  Kaffir, as you may know, in Afrikaans, is the equivalent of the n-word.
[00:46:11.522 --> 00:46:16.984]  So these are germs that were specifically engineered to kill only black people.
[00:46:16.984 --> 00:46:21.385]  In other words, an ethnic biological weapon.
[00:46:21.385 --> 00:46:23.346]  Had Project Coast really gone this far?
[00:46:26.109 --> 00:46:36.153]  From the beginning, this idea of can we find a way to control the size of the black population was considered one of the most important areas of research.
[00:46:36.153 --> 00:46:44.517]  It got even more important over time as the size of the black population and the seriousness of the uprisings increased.
[00:46:44.517 --> 00:46:50.900]  So that's one reason why they got into genetic modification.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:56.984]  Research into, is there a way to have contraceptives?
[00:46:56.984 --> 00:46:58.506]  Oh yeah, let's play that part.
[00:46:58.506 --> 00:47:04.230]  And somehow basically sterilize blacks without them knowing it.
[00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:10.735]  And kind of all kinds of what at the time, or in hindsight, seemed like pretty far out research.
[00:47:10.735 --> 00:47:18.582]  There was some talk about an ethnic group, the Project Coast Working Women, that was called Black Bomb.
[00:47:19.827 --> 00:47:20.568]  That was great.
[00:47:20.568 --> 00:47:27.852]  That was the most fun I've had in my life.
[00:47:27.852 --> 00:47:35.237]  That whole episode of the ethnic weapon was very well set out in court, in the court papers.
[00:47:35.237 --> 00:47:46.244]  What happened is we had the objective to synthesize a certain protein that was in
[00:47:48.231 --> 00:47:48.571]  Sperm
[00:48:06.803 --> 00:48:12.745]  That's right, and you can go read those court documents.
[00:48:12.745 --> 00:48:18.826]  It's been in the BBC, it's been in Der Spiegel, it's mainly been in European papers and South African.
[00:48:18.826 --> 00:48:23.727]  But I remember watching hearings on it in Congress back in the mid-90s on C-SPAN.
[00:48:23.727 --> 00:48:28.248]  But it was Israel, the US, China was looking at it.
[00:48:28.248 --> 00:48:29.789]  Israel wanted to use it on the Arabs.
[00:48:30.925 --> 00:48:50.540]  The problem was about a third of the folks living in Israel are Arab Jews or what you'd call actual precursor original Jews from Abraham, Abraham and Isaac and all the rest of it that goes back to the same people.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:55.424]  And so they had to back off of that because it killed a third of the Jews in Israel.
[00:48:55.424 --> 00:48:58.346]  But this is all the type of stuff that's going on.
[00:48:59.807 --> 00:49:05.149]  Wouldn't kill Ashkenazi Jews, but it would have killed the Sephardic Jews.
[00:49:05.149 --> 00:49:10.011]  People like my late friend Aaron Russo, they'd kill him dead in a hammer.
[00:49:10.011 --> 00:49:17.594]  So when you say anti-Semitic, you can actually say it means being anti-Arab or anti-Jew, because that's where those folks come from.
[00:49:17.594 --> 00:49:22.916]  Now the European derivation, and if you get into all that research, they'd have been just fine.
[00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:27.718]  The problem is so many of them have been married with Sephardic Jews, or
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:33.084]  What you'd call the original 12 tribes, I guess, that it would wipe those folks out.
[00:49:33.084 --> 00:49:44.594]  See, that's the problem with a race-specific bioweapon, because, yeah, you can create a bullet that'll kill 70-90% of the black people, but it'll kill 23% of white people.
[00:49:44.594 --> 00:49:47.056]  See, we're too similar.
[00:49:47.056 --> 00:49:54.242]  But don't worry, they've gotten so much more high-tech now that they're working on that problem.
[00:49:55.845 --> 00:50:01.630]  They're working on that problem, and they put fluoride in everybody's water, they feed GMO to the white kids as well.
[00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:13.419]  The globalists can just get away with wiping out Africa, because the governments are so corrupt, it's been colonial forever, it never got its freedom, and they've already gotten away with so much that that's where they're testing everything.
[00:50:13.419 --> 00:50:19.944]  But I will assure all the liberal white yuppies that'll grab your shirt and say, you know what, there are too many black people.
[00:50:19.944 --> 00:50:21.025]  We need these abortuaries.
[00:50:22.133 --> 00:50:26.994]  I've had black and white liberals tell me that black people are bad, need to be gotten rid of.
[00:50:26.994 --> 00:50:29.455]  I've had black leaders on who said, yeah, of course, we've all heard that.
[00:50:29.455 --> 00:50:33.096]  That's the big, dirty, weird secret of the Democratic Party.
[00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:42.658]  Going back to Margaret Singer recruiting blacks who would hate other blacks and help keep them down, dumb them down, steal their money, not get them funding.
[00:50:42.658 --> 00:50:45.279]  I mean, Al Sharpton's in the news, the FBI informant today.
[00:50:47.141 --> 00:50:50.943]  And Rangel and others saying it's, you know, slavery that blacks vote Republican.
[00:50:50.943 --> 00:50:55.907]  No, the real slavery is that you think you own all the black people.
[00:50:55.907 --> 00:50:58.628]  And you won't tell them about race-specific bioweapons, Sharpton.
[00:51:16.008 --> 00:51:18.189]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[00:52:00.251 --> 00:52:03.094]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:03.094 --> 00:52:08.218]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:08.218 --> 00:52:16.345]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:16.345 --> 00:52:20.869]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:20.869 --> 00:52:24.833]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:24.833 --> 00:52:27.235]  They now operate two distribution facilities,
[00:52:27.535 --> 00:52:30.757]  And employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:30.757 --> 00:52:33.939]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:33.939 --> 00:52:39.302]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:52:59.693 --> 00:53:03.876]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[00:53:03.876 --> 00:53:08.178]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[00:53:08.178 --> 00:53:13.621]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?

[00:54:01.834 --> 00:54:06.415]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[00:54:06.415 --> 00:54:09.795]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
[00:54:09.795 --> 00:54:11.376]  You're the pretender!
[00:54:11.376 --> 00:54:12.796]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[00:54:16.053 --> 00:54:20.959]  Speaking of protest music, I was talking to Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins fame this morning.
[00:54:20.959 --> 00:54:24.062]  He's got some new heavy songs coming out.
[00:54:24.062 --> 00:54:26.785]  And he's gonna send them to us right before his album comes out.
[00:54:26.785 --> 00:54:29.688]  We're gonna get to premiere some of them here.
[00:54:29.688 --> 00:54:32.571]  And on drums is Tommy Lee, so you know it's gonna be good.
[00:54:32.571 --> 00:54:34.153]  Look for that coming up next week.
[00:54:34.153 --> 00:54:37.217]  And the reason that's important is there are so many people
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:51.788]  Out there in Hollywood, rock stars, hip-hop, you name it, that are awake to what's going on, but so few, like Dave Mustaine or Billy Corrigan, have the courage to come out and speak out about it.
[00:54:53.302 --> 00:54:55.983]  The reason I mention that is I was just texting him during the break.
[00:54:55.983 --> 00:54:58.064]  There is so much election news to get to.
[00:54:58.064 --> 00:54:59.185]  I'll open the phones up.
[00:54:59.185 --> 00:55:01.086]  I promise I want to take your calls.
[00:55:01.086 --> 00:55:03.827]  I have Dr. Joseph Mercola joining us.
[00:55:03.827 --> 00:55:18.195]  But when you heard me playing one of the top medical doctors in the government of South Africa, working with the U.S., China, Israel, and others to create race-specific bioweapons, you need to understand that this is very serious.
[00:55:19.562 --> 00:55:28.209]  And PNAC back in 2000, the Project for an American Century, chaired by Dick Cheney, put out a paper saying we should look at the development and use of these.
[00:55:28.209 --> 00:55:34.594]  That's all I'm trying to say is you can't trust the people on top of this medical system, not the average doctors or nurses.
[00:55:34.594 --> 00:55:39.839]  And the way to stop this type of tyranny is to not just shut up when they say shut up, is to not just
[00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:44.151]  Be a coward when they're disappearing people out of the hospital.
[00:55:44.151 --> 00:55:46.192]  No, talk about it like the Border Patrol's done.
[00:55:46.192 --> 00:55:49.153]  Reaching out to us, and doctors have reached out to us.
[00:55:49.153 --> 00:55:55.596]  And then we report it, and millions find out about it, but everybody else doesn't because no one else will cover it.
[00:55:55.596 --> 00:56:03.340]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, DrudgeReport.com carried our story.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:07.282]  And they had Democratic Party-run websites attack us.
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:29.705]  And say the whack job Alex Jones, and in terms like that, with thinly sourced articles, claims people are disappearing, really thinly sourced, the head of a hospital by name, naming the hospital where it happened, and then we're saying we have another medical doctor on record, and a whole bunch more that don't want to be on air.
[00:56:30.583 --> 00:56:40.007]  And then the government's telling everybody to shut up and don't talk about Ebola, and they're ordering millions of hazmat suits, and they're letting people with it travel around, and the border's open, and they're letting people fly in with it.
[00:56:40.007 --> 00:56:42.047]  I mean, something's obviously going on here!
[00:56:42.047 --> 00:56:46.309]  Let me tell you something.
[00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:48.810]  You're black, and you get this?
[00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:51.531]  You got a 70% chance of coming up with X's in your eyes.
[00:56:52.717 --> 00:56:58.722]  And I'm sorry that your leadership's run by the eugenics operation, but so's all the quote leadership.
[00:56:58.722 --> 00:57:14.577]  I'm just so sick of being called racist because I don't want to kill all the black people, or I don't want to forcibly inject all the girls in Guatemala and Mexico and Nicaragua and El Salvador with HPV that's known to reduce fertility and attack the ovaries on record.
[00:57:15.845 --> 00:57:19.586]  You're not going to hear Mecha and La Raza because they're all on the globalist payroll.
[00:57:19.586 --> 00:57:21.087]  Look at their corporate funding.
[00:57:21.087 --> 00:57:22.707]  We don't have any of that corporate funding.
[00:57:22.707 --> 00:57:27.869]  They got 300, 400 corporate funders for groups that are like the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:57:27.869 --> 00:57:31.950]  Openly say, for our race everything, for your race nothing.
[00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:38.972]  We got the Democrats running around, the party of the Klan, saying it's racist if you don't vote Democrat.
[00:57:38.972 --> 00:57:39.612]  What a joke.
[00:57:39.612 --> 00:57:41.813]  I'm going to cover that in the next hour ahead of your calls.
[00:57:43.021 --> 00:57:45.122]  Briefly, I'm taking my DNA force.
[00:57:45.122 --> 00:57:46.703]  My kids are taking their DNA force.
[00:57:46.703 --> 00:57:50.205]  This is what I believe is boosting my natural defenses the most.
[00:57:50.205 --> 00:57:55.288]  Go read the medical facts, the NutraMedical facts, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:57:55.288 --> 00:57:59.951]  The actual patented facts on this, on a product where we can actually make claims.
[00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:00.911]  But I'm not going to make them on air.
[00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:04.893]  You go read what is on record, what they're patented, what they're proven to do.
[00:58:04.893 --> 00:58:06.854]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:06.854 --> 00:58:08.836]  The CoQ10, the BioPQQ.
[00:58:09.756 --> 00:58:15.780]  Of the organic, super-concentrated, nutramedical-level grade of that.
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:18.041]  And the secret sauce that comes in in a week or two.
[00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:21.323]  I can't tell you what it is yet, but I'm taking it.
[00:58:21.323 --> 00:58:24.805]  And then we've got the Silver Bullet, InfoWarsLive.com, colloidal silver.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:33.364]  And we've got the nascent iodine, X2, that I believe, from my research, is just as important as colloidal silver.
[00:58:33.364 --> 00:58:37.447]  And then we've got super metal vitality, and I mix this up and I drink it.
[00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:38.948]  And it is absolutely amazing.
[00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:40.489]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:40.489 --> 00:58:41.489]  Thank you all for your support.

[00:58:51.021 --> 00:58:54.683]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:58:54.683 --> 00:58:58.946]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:58:58.946 --> 00:59:00.727]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:59:00.727 --> 00:59:08.592]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[00:59:31.159 --> 00:59:37.623]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:59:52.794 --> 00:59:55.381]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.809 --> 01:00:08.109]  Big Brother.
[01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:09.870]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.630]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:13.211]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.211 --> 01:00:14.771]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.771 --> 01:00:18.953]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.953 --> 01:00:25.494]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.494 --> 01:00:30.976]  Well, we got a race to civic bio up, and all the pantheon of experts we've had on agree.
[01:00:30.976 --> 01:00:34.137]  Rapidly spreading across Africa, could infect millions, could kill millions.
[01:00:35.114 --> 01:00:38.495]  They're clearly, even mainstream news admits they're lying about the numbers that are dying over there.
[01:00:38.495 --> 01:00:38.915]  They say it's 5,000.
[01:00:38.915 --> 01:00:46.918]  The computer models are, by the end of the year, 1.4 million New York Times reports that could have it.
[01:00:46.918 --> 01:00:52.921]  And they're gonna let, as that exponential spread happens, people get visas and fly over here.
[01:00:52.921 --> 01:00:57.862]  And then if nurses treat them, and even get fevers, the CDC's gonna tell them to fly.
[01:00:57.862 --> 01:00:58.843]  What do you think about that?
[01:00:59.608 --> 01:01:04.150]  And what do you think about Reid now tries begging the public to vote for him?
[01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:07.531]  Oh, you're going to call us terrorists if we don't vote for you?
[01:01:07.531 --> 01:01:09.152]  And 1 million Senate ads.
[01:01:09.152 --> 01:01:12.654]  They're buying 1 million ads, the Democrats are.
[01:01:12.654 --> 01:01:20.617]  New York Times, 70% of Republicans, or the New York Times reports it's a 70% chance Republicans will take the Senate.
[01:01:20.617 --> 01:01:24.098]  Washington Post says 90% chance.
[01:01:24.098 --> 01:01:24.979]  But here's the issue.
[01:01:26.107 --> 01:01:33.732]  They have branded with the illegals who they pay for everything, give them free guitar lessons, in-state tuition, free health care.
[01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:48.463]  The red carpet with the banks, the corporations, Silicon Valley, I'm going to go over these articles in the next segment, rolls out the red carpet in every way to incentivize coming here.
[01:01:49.281 --> 01:01:54.824]  Now once you're here and you're a Hispanic citizen or black citizen or white citizen, you're not getting squat.
[01:01:54.824 --> 01:01:57.105]  You're going to get the book thrown at you.
[01:01:57.105 --> 01:02:01.468]  But the courts just will not prosecute illegals for crimes, felonies, drunk driving.
[01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:06.851]  They are G.O.D.s in the state's eyes, but only to incentivize.
[01:02:06.851 --> 01:02:13.715]  I mean, I drove by Home Depot, the corner of 35 and 290 today.
[01:02:13.715 --> 01:02:15.596]  I was late getting into the office.
[01:02:15.596 --> 01:02:15.936]  It was like 1050.
[01:02:18.424 --> 01:02:22.287]  That's why I wasn't on the first 30 minutes or first 20 minutes.
[01:02:22.287 --> 01:02:23.909]  And there had to be a hundred illegals.
[01:02:23.909 --> 01:02:36.679]  I mean, I want to send out there in the morning, I guess to like 10 o'clock, and just walk up with folks that can speak Spanish, some of our reporters that speak good Spanish out there, and just talk about, where are you from?
[01:02:36.679 --> 01:02:39.401]  They'll say, I'm from Guatemala, I'm from Nicaragua, I'm from El Salvador.
[01:02:39.401 --> 01:02:42.404]  It's not even so much Mexico.
[01:02:42.404 --> 01:02:47.288]  And they just come, and then they go work, and then their wife goes and gets on welfare,
[01:02:48.519 --> 01:02:59.462]  And then that's how they then become financially viable, which is fine and dandy, except they're above the law.
[01:02:59.462 --> 01:03:11.426]  And then they, I mean, you talk to them, like the director of Utopia, the film that were the exclusive distributor until
[01:03:12.662 --> 01:03:14.242]  December, Joel Gilbert.
[01:03:14.242 --> 01:03:19.564]  And they go, yeah, no, I'm here to escape socialism, but I like Obama, because he gives me stuff.
[01:03:19.564 --> 01:03:22.265]  So you left socialism, but you like to come here and get it.
[01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:25.946]  And they're like, yeah, until it collapses.
[01:03:25.946 --> 01:03:28.206]  So I got to hand it to the illegals.
[01:03:28.206 --> 01:03:29.627]  They at least know what's going on.
[01:03:29.627 --> 01:03:31.367]  I mean, they're not stupid.
[01:03:31.367 --> 01:03:34.328]  I come up here and I get free stuff.
[01:03:34.328 --> 01:03:37.309]  If I vote for you, OK.
[01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:38.469]  It's all about a takedown.
[01:03:40.373 --> 01:03:45.696]  And the funny thing is, the illegals will then go out and just own guns illegally.
[01:03:45.696 --> 01:03:48.857]  So, I don't know where all this is going, but it's a mess.
[01:03:48.857 --> 01:03:55.340]  And the Democrats, to have power and control are doing this, and the Republican leadership wants to do it with them!
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:04:06.006]  Because they're bought and paid for by the same interest, and once they have 51%, which they've almost got, this is a last gasp, as Mets and La Raza have said, of white America.
[01:04:06.006 --> 01:04:06.846]  No, it's not.
[01:04:06.846 --> 01:04:08.027]  It's way past that.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:15.941]  I identify with ideas and with morals and with what people stand for.
[01:04:15.941 --> 01:04:30.164]  Not with what color they are, but the globalists can get people to identify racially and then attach it to the immoral policies of anti-family, anti-gun, socialism.
[01:04:30.164 --> 01:04:37.846]  And so, I take the high road and try to say, hey, don't sterilize your kids, hey, let's promote free market, hey, let's try to fix your countries.
[01:04:37.846 --> 01:04:38.326]  It's like, no.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.883]  Because it's all about winning, even if it wrecks everything.
[01:04:43.883 --> 01:04:47.626]  It's all about, it doesn't matter if it wrecks everything, and it's a giant slum.
[01:04:47.626 --> 01:04:52.410]  America becomes a giant ghetto slum.
[01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:58.294]  Third world, it doesn't matter, because at least the TV will say the Raza won.
[01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.016]  It's just, it's a disaster.
[01:05:01.263 --> 01:05:07.905]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:13.046]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:21.768]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.768 --> 01:05:24.249]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:24.249 --> 01:05:28.110]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:05:30.137 --> 01:05:34.859]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:05:34.859 --> 01:05:38.681]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:39.942]  Others don't.
[01:05:39.942 --> 01:05:42.063]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:43.864]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:43.864 --> 01:05:46.745]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:46.745 --> 01:05:53.369]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:53.369 --> 01:05:56.070]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:58.451]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:05:58.451 --> 01:05:59.292]  Others don't.
[01:06:00.509 --> 01:06:01.830]  The experts are clear.
[01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:08.936]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:06:08.936 --> 01:06:15.222]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:06:15.222 --> 01:06:18.805]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:06:18.925 --> 01:06:23.147]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:06:23.147 --> 01:06:28.470]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:29.491]  Not our iodine.
[01:06:29.491 --> 01:06:35.834]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:07:12.889 --> 01:07:18.856]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not
[01:07:19.076 --> 01:07:19.296]  Of course.
[01:07:40.816 --> 01:07:50.943]  That all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[01:08:05.892 --> 01:08:08.674]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.871 --> 01:08:15.133]  We ain't got no badges.
[01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:16.934]  We don't need no badges.
[01:08:16.934 --> 01:08:19.256]  I don't have to show you any stinking badges!
[01:08:19.256 --> 01:08:22.699]  Better not come any closer!
[01:08:22.699 --> 01:08:24.520]  No sea tonto, hombre!
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.962]  We didn't try to do you any harm.
[01:08:26.962 --> 01:08:29.444]  Why don't you try to be a little more polite?
[01:08:29.444 --> 01:08:33.047]  Give us your gun, and we'll leave you in peace.
[01:08:33.047 --> 01:08:35.649]  I need my gun myself.
[01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:37.931]  Ah, throw that old iron over here.
[01:08:38.624 --> 01:08:40.505]  We'll pick it up and go Norway!
[01:08:40.505 --> 01:08:46.490]  You go anyway without my gun and go quick!
[01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:51.133]  Well, that's the treasure of the Sierra Madres.
[01:08:51.133 --> 01:08:53.034]  And I think we should merge with Mexico.
[01:08:53.034 --> 01:08:55.316]  There's any country that we should merge with.
[01:08:55.316 --> 01:08:57.277]  It's not Switzerland.
[01:08:57.277 --> 01:08:59.779]  It's not Monte Carlo.
[01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:02.201]  It's not the Netherlands.
[01:09:02.201 --> 01:09:04.463]  Beautiful, well-run, incredible countries.
[01:09:05.222 --> 01:09:29.259]  No, I think we should merge with Sierra Leone, total collapse, bedlam, Ebola, death, rape, robbery, murder, and Mexico, one of the highest crime rates, if not the highest in the world, 90,000, it used to be 80, people killed the last 6-7 years in the drug war, giant mass graves found everywhere, collapsing society except for a few resort towns like Cancun.
[01:09:29.259 --> 01:09:30.380]  And even those are dangerous now.
[01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:47.215]  But we're not allowed to judge and say that that is a dangerous place, or that we shouldn't merge with that, or advertise to all of collapsing Central and South America and Southern North America, come here, we'll give you free
[01:09:51.741 --> 01:09:52.623]  The Washington Times.
[01:10:06.132 --> 01:10:24.069]  One of the contractors housing some of the surge of illegal immigrant children from the summer offers them a petting zoo with miniature ponies and tilapia fish farm operation and guitar lessons according to documents released Thursday by the senator who questioned whether the plush accommodations were a good use of taxpayer money.
[01:10:24.069 --> 01:10:25.070]  Well, be loving!
[01:10:28.462 --> 01:10:30.565]  Be loving, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:30.565 --> 01:10:35.350]  I know that I can go to Mexico and just have a baby and go in and it's free.
[01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:39.335]  Or bring my kids there and just say, give me free stuff and they'll do it.
[01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:42.018]  No, they'd say, you're here illegally and lock you up.
[01:10:42.018 --> 01:10:45.803]  But that's okay.
[01:10:45.803 --> 01:10:48.185]  Now the crime wave is exploding.
[01:10:49.153 --> 01:11:03.542]  across the United States and so many police are being killed that it's now in the news today though that this might actually cause a backlash to this because it's so dangerous.
[01:11:03.542 --> 01:11:14.749]  Yeah, when Ebola starts spreading, if it does, how is Obama and the globalists not going to get in trouble for leaving the flights open and bringing people in and letting the nurses and doctors run around on the planes and subways and everywhere else?
[01:11:18.726 --> 01:11:24.772]  Arizona, already about a third of the state has signs up saying don't go into this area, it's controlled by drug cartels.
[01:11:24.772 --> 01:11:27.735]  The southern third of it.
[01:11:27.735 --> 01:11:34.061]  They already have the kidnapping capital of the United States is now Phoenix.
[01:11:34.061 --> 01:11:38.485]  With thousands of kidnappings a year being taken to Mexico, just like in Mexico.
[01:11:38.485 --> 01:11:42.569]  You know why I don't go to Nicaragua or El Salvador or Guatemala?
[01:11:42.569 --> 01:11:43.170]  I've been down there.
[01:11:44.096 --> 01:11:50.420]  Because you've got a very good chance that you're going to be kidnapped, or your children will be.
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:12:01.126]  But see, we should just accept kidnapping as a cultural exchange, and accept sewage running down the roads, and accept this.
[01:12:01.126 --> 01:12:09.211]  Just like we should accept 2 plus 2 equals 5, and Obamacare has death panels and doubles prices on average, and raises 20 plus taxes, 7 of them on poor people.
[01:12:10.507 --> 01:12:21.336]  Even the State Department's been forced to issue, the last five years running, a Mexico travel warning.
[01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:26.079]  Now even the resorts are dangerous down there.
[01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:30.623]  I won't even send reporters down there.
[01:12:30.623 --> 01:12:31.704]  Do you understand 90,000 dead?
[01:12:31.704 --> 01:12:33.025]  58,000 died in 10 years of Vietnam.
[01:12:39.425 --> 01:12:39.766]  90,000.
[01:12:39.766 --> 01:12:45.690]  And by the way, there's over a million people missing in Mexico, according to their own numbers.
[01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:50.354]  And when they go looking for one grave, they'll find graves every day in the news.
[01:12:50.354 --> 01:12:58.680]  Every day they find whole fields with 40 here, 20 there, 100 there, of dead men, women, and children.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.182]  And by the way, you know what the coyotes do?
[01:13:01.267 --> 01:13:17.816]  If they catch you coming across an area and you paid another gang and you didn't know, from Nicaragua, El Salvador, it doesn't matter, you're coming across Mexico, do you know what they do with the men, women, and children they take you and they shoot you and they put you in a shallow grave across from Texas, across from Arizona, across from California?
[01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:20.711]  Across from New Mexico.
[01:13:20.711 --> 01:13:33.082]  And it doesn't matter because Robert Rodriguez is down with the RAZA, which is just a gang of rich, powerful Hispanics with the globalist mafia, just like the rich, powerful black mafia, feeding on black people.
[01:13:33.082 --> 01:13:34.523]  They'll never tell you a word about that.
[01:13:34.523 --> 01:13:41.610]  He puts out a movie where Don Johnson talks like a Texas redneck and goes around shooting pregnant Hispanic women in the stomach.
[01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:43.992]  Let me tell you who shoots pregnant Hispanic women in the stomach.
[01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.312]  Mexican mafia does.
[01:13:47.312 --> 01:13:49.954]  And they kill Nicaraguan and El Salvador women.
[01:13:49.954 --> 01:13:56.097]  About half the people they dig out of these graves, look it up, are women and children.
[01:13:56.097 --> 01:14:04.722]  It's not white people down there mowing down, they wish they could find a case of it, it'd be all over the news, mowing down Hispanics.
[01:14:04.722 --> 01:14:06.103]  It's Mexico, baby.
[01:14:10.199 --> 01:14:12.760]  They take them and they shoot them and they throw them in ditches.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.980]  That's why they're all over the border.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:29.385]  You pretty much dig anywhere on those routes over the Texas border, into Mexico or Arizona especially, and you will find graves of the people with their little bags and their money and their little Mayan hats trying to come up here and get jobs.
[01:14:29.385 --> 01:14:29.845]  Poor people.
[01:14:29.845 --> 01:14:30.805]  I feel sorry for them.
[01:14:30.805 --> 01:14:31.465]  But you know what?
[01:14:31.465 --> 01:14:33.486]  I didn't put them in the ditch and shoot them in the back of the head.
[01:14:34.346 --> 01:14:34.886]  You know what?
[01:14:34.886 --> 01:14:35.646]  It's my fault.
[01:14:35.646 --> 01:14:36.946]  You're right.
[01:14:36.946 --> 01:14:37.987]  I'm the bad guy.
[01:14:37.987 --> 01:14:39.207]  I'm the white devil.
[01:14:39.207 --> 01:14:40.147]  I did it.
[01:14:40.147 --> 01:14:48.328]  So take your Gardasil shots, drink your fructose corn syrup, and the man's gonna saw your legs off when you get diabetes.
[01:14:48.328 --> 01:14:49.889]  See, the man's already killing you.
[01:14:49.889 --> 01:14:53.749]  They just want you here to vote long enough to get the guns.
[01:14:53.749 --> 01:14:56.130]  Then they're gonna shut that border down real nice.
[01:14:56.130 --> 01:15:02.991]  And you'll be drinking high fructose corn syrup and taking Gardasil shots that are race-specific, and they're gonna kill you dead in a hammer.
[01:15:04.141 --> 01:15:06.143]  Take 10, 20 years, but hey, it doesn't matter.
[01:15:06.143 --> 01:15:17.432]  Because you can go down to the La Raza Race Center and have some little mafia head sit up there and tell you how much they love you and want to take care of your culture.
[01:15:17.432 --> 01:15:26.640]  It's all a load of CIA-written, liberation theology baloney, boulderdash, cockamamie fraud.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:31.404]  See, I've read all the declassified CIA, Carnegie Endowment, Ford Foundation documents.
[01:15:32.267 --> 01:15:35.829]  From the 50s, how they would create race war in America and divide everybody.
[01:15:54.318 --> 01:16:19.809]  And whites or the Republicans will buy into it because they're liberal and we'll take over and create a giant race division and then have the federal government ride herd all the racial groups like a big giant prison where you got the Mexican area and you got the El Salvadoran area and you got the Brazilian area and they're all killing each other and you got the black area and you got the Muslim area and you got the gay area and you got the liberal area and you got the redneck area and you got all
[01:16:20.649 --> 01:16:30.854]  All the areas, instead of having an area of free market, prosperity, private property, free association, liberty, true freedom, renaissance, no!
[01:16:30.854 --> 01:16:42.120]  It's a system where they claim they're fighting racism, where all they teach kids is about race, and about what somebody looks like, the very opposite of what Martin Luther King said.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.400]  How do you conquer the country?
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.181]  How do you take over?
[01:16:45.046 --> 01:16:46.447]  The demographics change.
[01:16:46.447 --> 01:16:48.668]  The Republicans are sweeping, taking over.
[01:16:48.668 --> 01:16:52.530]  It's 1956.
[01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:55.892]  1958, 1960, what do you do?
[01:16:55.892 --> 01:17:07.939]  All these veterans came back, even from Klan families, and had seen racism and war and death and fought right beside people of other races, and they didn't want to be racist anymore, so the Klan was dying.
[01:17:07.939 --> 01:17:09.120]  What do you do?
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.061]  What do you do when it isn't working anymore?
[01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:14.323]  You just use race politics on the minorities.
[01:17:15.134 --> 01:17:15.794]  And it's worked great!
[01:17:15.794 --> 01:17:18.996]  It's worked wonderful!
[01:17:18.996 --> 01:17:31.604]  And that's why Miller Brewing, and Anheuser-Busch, and all the big universities, and all the big TV networks, La Raza and Mecha get so much funding, it'll make your head spin.
[01:17:31.604 --> 01:17:38.589]  Billions a year from globalist corporations.
[01:17:38.589 --> 01:17:41.251]  To be racially based, and to be racist.
[01:17:41.251 --> 01:17:43.332]  The good news is most Hispanics aren't buying into it.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.281]  And I don't just say that.
[01:17:45.281 --> 01:17:49.326]  You go out in public with me?
[01:17:49.326 --> 01:17:55.654]  Per capita, black people and Hispanics love me more than white people do.
[01:17:55.654 --> 01:17:58.458]  It's amazing.
[01:17:58.458 --> 01:18:03.224]  Percentage-wise, we have an even bigger percentage of what you'd call quote minorities listening to this show.
[01:18:04.434 --> 01:18:10.755]  And that's the type of hope we have, is that this propaganda is so evil, it cannot and should not work on people.
[01:18:10.755 --> 01:18:14.736]  But they're force-feeding it everywhere, in the colleges, and the public schools.
[01:18:14.736 --> 01:18:18.377]  When I went to Anderson High, they force-fed it in art class, and U.S.
[01:18:18.377 --> 01:18:21.037]  history, and Texas history.
[01:18:21.037 --> 01:18:24.238]  And they force-fed it at UT.
[01:18:24.238 --> 01:18:28.998]  When I was in high school, they'd take us to UT field trips, and I would sit there and hear this crap.
[01:18:28.998 --> 01:18:32.019]  And, I mean, that is all they push, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:35.123 --> 01:18:47.010]  And it's so sad because they don't want us to unify around ideas of freedom that'll make us all incredibly successful and incredibly wealthy and incredibly free and independent if we take those opportunities.
[01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:48.230]  Instead, we've been domesticated.
[01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:55.134]  And I'm sorry, I haven't even gotten into election news yet, but so much of the election news is about the illegals.
[01:18:55.134 --> 01:19:03.739]  As La Raza and Mecha and others publish voter guides on where to vote illegally, where you can vote without an ID.
[01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:04.480]  Look at these headlines.
[01:19:05.706 --> 01:19:09.489]  Obama's midterm loss record could make history.
[01:19:09.489 --> 01:19:10.710]  Roll call.
[01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:14.573]  Desperate Democrats resorts to race baiting to spur black vote.
[01:19:14.573 --> 01:19:15.173]  Washington Times.
[01:19:15.173 --> 01:19:16.754]  Yeah, here it is.
[01:19:16.754 --> 01:19:24.500]  Charles Rangel says some Republicans believe that slavery isn't over.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:31.386]  I mean, that is just so amazing that that's what they resort to.
[01:19:32.549 --> 01:19:41.075]  Landru, Obama and I aren't popper in the South because it's racist and sexist.
[01:19:41.075 --> 01:19:46.279]  Democrats, vote or we'll kick your bleep.
[01:19:46.279 --> 01:19:49.121]  Facebook data mining for political views and what do they want?
[01:19:49.121 --> 01:19:51.003]  Open borders.
[01:19:51.003 --> 01:19:54.085]  Zuckerberg said his users are dumb effers.
[01:19:54.085 --> 01:19:55.306]  We're going to come back with all this.

[01:23:08.293 --> 01:23:15.336]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:23:15.336 --> 01:23:18.317]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:23:18.317 --> 01:23:21.258]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.

[01:23:56.287 --> 01:23:57.528]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:57.528 --> 01:24:05.455]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:15.253]  I want to get your take on election 2014.
[01:24:15.253 --> 01:24:18.296]  That's the big subject I want to hear from listeners on.

[01:24:22.419 --> 01:24:23.620]  Please give me a call.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:27.503]  I'd love to hear from you on this Halloween Friday worldwide transmission.
[01:24:27.503 --> 01:24:27.563]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:27.643]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:27.643 --> 01:24:30.144]  What you have is a pantheon of different political ideas
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:47.362]  out there, and most of it is disinformation or a substrata of the system so it isn't complete.
[01:24:47.362 --> 01:25:06.588]  And I can tell you honestly, from my deep research and interviewing top experts from around the world in social engineering, propaganda, bioweapons, intelligence operations, criminology, epidemiology, biology, social sciences,
[01:25:07.847 --> 01:25:12.150]  The top psychiatrists, the top psychologists, the top serial killer experts.
[01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:14.652]  I mean, just think of the guests that have been on this show over the years.
[01:25:14.652 --> 01:25:18.214]  And I'm here listening to every show because I'm in the middle of it.
[01:25:18.214 --> 01:25:24.418]  I'm focused in a high adrenaline state to everything I'm covering.
[01:25:24.418 --> 01:25:26.439]  So I really know what I'm talking about.
[01:25:26.439 --> 01:25:28.281]  We really have their number.
[01:25:28.281 --> 01:25:31.182]  They really are trying to sterilize everybody in Latin America.
[01:25:31.182 --> 01:25:33.284]  They really are trying to kill the black people in Africa.
[01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:38.957]  And you don't hear a word out of that of any of the Latin American leaders or any of the black leaders here.
[01:25:38.957 --> 01:25:41.178]  You hear it out of the African leaders.
[01:25:41.178 --> 01:25:47.161]  You hear it from Nobel Prize winners in Africa.
[01:25:47.161 --> 01:25:55.165]  You understand, folks, the people running things and running all this race baiting want us all fighting with each other while they kill us.
[01:25:55.165 --> 01:26:04.250]  And the group they're trying to keep so close, they act like they love so much, the minorities that are really the majority worldwide, you are actually being wiped out by white racists.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.201]  That's what's so incredible about it.
[01:26:08.201 --> 01:26:15.843]  It's like black leaders would go to the funeral of Robert Byrd, a grand dragon, who called for sterilizing all blacks in the 50s.
[01:26:15.843 --> 01:26:24.646]  And the ADL will give awards to Schwarzenegger, who said he loved Hitler, and give awards to George Soros, who worked for Hitler.
[01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:28.227]  And then the ADL will write articles about how I might be a racist.
[01:26:28.227 --> 01:26:31.108]  I mean, it's total 180 baloney.
[01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:36.271]  And we just gotta have a break with these people.
[01:26:36.271 --> 01:26:39.875]  I don't care what color you are or where you even came from.
[01:26:39.875 --> 01:26:45.720]  If you're for free market, Second Amendment, pro-life, you have arguments on both sides of that.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:56.390]  But if you don't have human dignity, if you don't value life, if you don't care about children, if you're for death panels, if you want to euthanize people,
[01:26:57.358 --> 01:26:59.099]  So you'll, quote, get more.
[01:26:59.099 --> 01:27:00.599]  That's a lie to begin with.
[01:27:00.599 --> 01:27:02.680]  You won't get more in a system like that.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.460]  No one's going to care about you.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.261]  There's going to be no love.
[01:27:06.261 --> 01:27:14.344]  I hate these sociopathic robots you run into that think they're smart because they're narcissistic, they're aggressive, they're con artists.
[01:27:14.344 --> 01:27:17.325]  They'd rather cheat you out of a dollar than make a million bucks with you.
[01:27:17.325 --> 01:27:18.145]  They're failures.
[01:27:18.145 --> 01:27:21.126]  They came from bad families.
[01:27:21.126 --> 01:27:26.728]  And you've got countries with a majority of people that just come from bad families, bad histories, and they don't have any hope.
[01:27:31.423 --> 01:27:32.664]  I want a renaissance.
[01:27:32.664 --> 01:27:33.765]  I want free will.
[01:27:33.765 --> 01:27:35.346]  I want free association.
[01:27:35.346 --> 01:27:36.547]  I want you to win.
[01:27:36.547 --> 01:27:38.889]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:27:38.889 --> 01:27:40.350]  I want you to have dignity.
[01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:41.892]  I want you to have success.
[01:27:41.892 --> 01:27:43.213]  I want you to be wealthy.
[01:27:43.213 --> 01:27:44.714]  I want you to be strong.
[01:27:44.714 --> 01:27:50.519]  I want our progeny to explore the universe and the dimensions together.
[01:27:52.079 --> 01:28:00.486]  Not have it all robbed by the British royal family that's been funding the planetary system since the 1850s under eugenics.
[01:28:00.486 --> 01:28:06.151]  We live under a plan they launched, and just one spinoff was communism.
[01:28:06.151 --> 01:28:08.853]  Another spinoff was Nazism.
[01:28:08.853 --> 01:28:10.535]  Transhumanism.
[01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:12.577]  It all goes directly back to them!
[01:28:14.403 --> 01:28:21.171]  And you don't, you're not part of their cult unless you've got an extremely high IQ and you're a psychopath or a sociopath.
[01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:27.919]  You've got to have an IQ of 150 or higher and you've got to have a vicious hatred for humanity.
[01:28:27.919 --> 01:28:31.122]  And if you do, you know who Prince Charles hangs out with almost every day?
[01:28:31.122 --> 01:28:33.125]  These psychopathic scientists with 170 IQs.
[01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:42.818]  And he will just grovel to them in meetings and events, they've written about it, and just, just, oh, sir, oh, oh.
[01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:48.784]  I mean, I'll never forget Senator Rockefeller, when John P. Holdren came in to give a testimony like five years ago, we played clips.
[01:28:50.151 --> 01:28:59.599]  And it comes in, and Jay Rockefeller, who I've seen many of his hearings, he was the chairman of the committee, he's now retiring, he spent 10 minutes just bowing his head.
[01:28:59.599 --> 01:29:11.468]  We ought to find that video going, Sir, I, the honor is, there is no one better, your plan is so incredible, what you're doing for us, behind the scenes, you know, you don't like to brag, we just, oh, eco-science, sir.
[01:29:11.468 --> 01:29:12.809]  And you know why?
[01:29:12.809 --> 01:29:15.832]  Because Paul Ehrlich,
[01:29:17.031 --> 01:29:27.705]  His wife Annie Ehrlich and John P. Holdren's plan, written in 1974, is the declassified global plan for everything.
[01:29:27.705 --> 01:29:31.190]  John P. Holdren is essentially the pilot of Earth.
[01:29:31.190 --> 01:29:33.133]  You understand that?
[01:29:34.735 --> 01:29:38.800]  The elite voted in their councils and basically elected him to run everything.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:39.180]  And he does.
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:40.742]  He's at the White House right now.
[01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:41.462]  You understand?
[01:29:41.462 --> 01:29:43.925]  They are the forces of pure evil!
[01:29:43.925 --> 01:29:45.567]  They're coming for everybody!
[01:29:45.567 --> 01:29:49.751]  Wake up or die!
[01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:51.152]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:53.675]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.675 --> 01:29:56.378]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.968 --> 01:30:02.869]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:30:02.869 --> 01:30:07.410]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:11.871]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:30:11.871 --> 01:30:19.173]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:30:19.173 --> 01:30:28.236]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:34.020]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:41.605]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:30:41.605 --> 01:30:44.187]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:30:44.187 --> 01:30:49.351]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWallet.
[01:30:49.651 --> 01:30:54.595]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:30:54.595 --> 01:30:55.636]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:31:01.144 --> 01:31:10.810]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:20.735]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:31:20.735 --> 01:31:23.657]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[01:31:23.857 --> 01:31:24.157]  I think?
[01:31:38.834 --> 01:31:39.074]  We're good.
[01:32:02.173 --> 01:32:03.514]  In the near future.
[01:32:03.514 --> 01:32:07.176]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:07.176 --> 01:32:08.016]  Security alert.
[01:32:08.016 --> 01:32:09.237]  Security alert.
[01:32:09.237 --> 01:32:11.238]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:11.238 --> 01:32:12.138]  Analysis.
[01:32:12.138 --> 01:32:12.839]  InfoWars.
[01:32:12.839 --> 01:32:14.840]  Building independent media operations.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:19.842]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:19.842 --> 01:32:20.863]  Prime Directive.
[01:32:20.863 --> 01:32:22.404]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:22.404 --> 01:32:25.265]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:25.265 --> 01:32:28.507]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:28.507 --> 01:32:30.668]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:30.868 --> 01:32:32.328]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:32.328 --> 01:32:35.149]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:37.110]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:41.151]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:32:41.151 --> 01:32:44.732]  Block free iPhone ads at Infowars.com.
[01:32:44.732 --> 01:32:48.094]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:48.094 --> 01:32:49.094]  Imperative.
[01:32:49.094 --> 01:32:51.115]  Destroy criminal-finished TV.
[01:32:51.115 --> 01:32:55.656]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:55.656 --> 01:32:57.937]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:33:17.018 --> 01:33:18.860]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:20.802]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:20.802 --> 01:33:22.603]  Or your mind.
[01:33:22.603 --> 01:33:26.686]  By the way, if you just tuned in, you said, oh, this radio show's playing Halloween music, and it's Halloween.
[01:33:26.686 --> 01:33:29.008]  Not really.
[01:33:29.008 --> 01:33:32.311]  We play Halloween music here every day.
[01:33:32.311 --> 01:33:43.340]  Because reality is, the globalists are a lot scarier than any fantasy witches or goblins that might be sneaking around out there tonight.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.381]  But it shows how...
[01:33:45.305 --> 01:33:58.114]  They can take something and have kids scared of goblins, but then there are real live government and globalist creatures that are our fellow humans who would do things far worse than anything you can imagine in a movie.
[01:33:58.114 --> 01:33:59.155]  Alright, I want to go to your calls.
[01:33:59.155 --> 01:34:01.796]  What's the toll free number to join us?
[01:34:01.796 --> 01:34:02.937]  It's 800-259-9231.
[01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:04.618]  Let me go through these headlines.
[01:34:04.618 --> 01:34:06.079]  Let me start back over.
[01:34:06.079 --> 01:34:09.902]  Obama's midterm loss record could make history.
[01:34:09.902 --> 01:34:12.324]  The big history is though, can we
[01:34:13.578 --> 01:34:17.020]  That would scare the Republicans immediately to actually engage in reform.
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:21.864]  Like, hey, repeal these unconstitutional executive orders shutting down our power plants.
[01:34:21.864 --> 01:34:24.626]  Hey, China put tariffs on us, put tariffs on them.
[01:34:24.626 --> 01:34:27.928]  Hey, repeal these gun laws.
[01:34:27.928 --> 01:34:29.589]  Hey, repeal Obamacare.
[01:34:29.589 --> 01:34:36.714]  See, if we don't instantly see a move by Boehner, that's his real name, John Boehner, then we know the fix is in.
[01:34:36.714 --> 01:34:37.915]  Remove him!
[01:34:37.915 --> 01:34:38.596]  And this could happen!
[01:34:39.816 --> 01:34:42.757]  Look, this route isn't going to stop with the Democrats being thrown out.
[01:34:42.757 --> 01:34:43.517]  Here's another question.
[01:34:43.517 --> 01:34:45.978]  What's Obama going to do in the two years he's got left?
[01:34:45.978 --> 01:34:49.139]  Well, he said, total amnesty and all deportations.
[01:34:49.139 --> 01:34:53.001]  It's already essentially happened, but he's going to make the announcement.
[01:34:53.001 --> 01:35:04.125]  And just come after the guns, launch all these new wars, just you name it, get ready, because we're not going to be out of the woods if the Republicans take the Senate.
[01:35:05.546 --> 01:35:08.667]  Desperate Democrats... I just said Dem-a-rats.
[01:35:08.667 --> 01:35:12.188]  That was a Freudian slip.
[01:35:12.188 --> 01:35:17.990]  Desperate Democrats resort to race-baiting to spur black vote.
[01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:24.132]  And I mention this, Charlie Rangel says some Republicans believe that slavery isn't over.
[01:35:24.132 --> 01:35:26.113]  Come on, Rangel!
[01:35:26.113 --> 01:35:28.373]  I mean, you make me want to throw up with all your race-baiting.
[01:35:28.373 --> 01:35:30.434]  Does it ever end?
[01:35:30.434 --> 01:35:31.274]  It certainly works.
[01:35:31.274 --> 01:35:33.175]  Ninety percent of blacks end up voting for Democrats only.
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:35.160]  Pretty amazing.
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:41.622]  Landru, Obama and I aren't popular in the South because he's racist and sexist.
[01:35:41.622 --> 01:35:42.863]  Let me tell you what the South's doing.
[01:35:42.863 --> 01:35:55.087]  They're in trailers, whether they're black or white or Hispanic, watching NASCAR and football and wearing the exact same clothes, drinking the same beer, and getting the exact same diabetes and dying young.
[01:35:55.087 --> 01:35:57.468]  They watch satellite television.
[01:35:57.468 --> 01:35:58.388]  That's what they do in the South.
[01:35:59.591 --> 01:36:04.035]  And I'm sad for the South, because just as I was a kid driving through, it looks like a bomb hit it.
[01:36:04.035 --> 01:36:05.817]  The South is beautiful.
[01:36:05.817 --> 01:36:08.019]  But, again, everybody fighting with each other?
[01:36:08.019 --> 01:36:11.982]  Black people in the South wear the same overalls and talk the same.
[01:36:11.982 --> 01:36:12.983]  It's the same people.
[01:36:12.983 --> 01:36:14.985]  It just makes me want to throw up.
[01:36:14.985 --> 01:36:15.626]  Let me tell you this.
[01:36:15.626 --> 01:36:24.333]  Black people in the South have a lot more in common with white people in the South than they have with the New World Order globalists that might as well be Martians come here to kill us all!
[01:36:25.293 --> 01:36:28.857]  That's how separate these globalists are and that Queen of England over there.
[01:36:28.857 --> 01:36:30.939]  And they want them all dead anyway, Alex.
[01:36:30.939 --> 01:36:31.499]  Exactly!
[01:36:31.499 --> 01:36:33.141]  I'm just sick of it!
[01:36:33.141 --> 01:36:35.163]  Democrats vote or we'll kick your bleep!
[01:36:36.414 --> 01:36:39.916]  New York Post, Democrats are telling voters they had better go to the polls.
[01:36:39.916 --> 01:36:49.943]  The New York State Democratic Committee is bullying people into voting next week with intimidating letters, warning that it is easy to find out which slackers fail to cast a ballot next Tuesday.
[01:36:49.943 --> 01:36:58.268]  Yeah, that's like when Cuomo came out a few months ago or six months ago and said, you, if you're pro-gun or pro-life, get out of the state.
[01:36:58.268 --> 01:36:59.089]  And people said, are you serious?
[01:36:59.089 --> 01:37:00.930]  He said, I said get out!
[01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:03.352]  What a delusional gangster!
[01:37:06.007 --> 01:37:11.069]  I mean, he really is going with the stereotype right there.
[01:37:11.069 --> 01:37:13.510]  And people are leaving New York in droves.
[01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:16.591]  And all the sponges are moving there, and it's not doing too good for the state, is it?
[01:37:16.591 --> 01:37:18.091]  He doesn't care.
[01:37:18.091 --> 01:37:25.634]  That's one thing about these criminals, is the mid-level minions like the governors and people are just retail thugs.
[01:37:25.634 --> 01:37:27.655]  They have no idea what they're even part of.
[01:37:27.655 --> 01:37:30.156]  Facebook data mining for political views, Politico.
[01:37:31.021 --> 01:37:37.264]  And of course, it's basically a big whitewash, but what it does is, they go on to admit, is quote, promote the liberal agenda.
[01:37:37.264 --> 01:37:39.044]  No, what it does is they use it as a weapon.
[01:37:39.044 --> 01:37:47.848]  During election time, they won't let us share stuff on our Facebook that exposes Obama, but they'll let ISIS and white supremacists operate on it.
[01:37:47.848 --> 01:37:54.210]  I say let everybody operate as long as you're not calling for violence, which means ISIS shouldn't be on there.
[01:37:54.210 --> 01:37:57.452]  Fundraising emails try to shame last-minute donors.
[01:38:00.137 --> 01:38:02.958]  And get their dollars.
[01:38:02.958 --> 01:38:04.299]  Non-citizens are voting.
[01:38:04.299 --> 01:38:10.361]  An article in the National Review documenting how massive the fraud is.
[01:38:10.361 --> 01:38:12.962]  Massive non-citizen voting uncovered in Maryland.
[01:38:12.962 --> 01:38:14.663]  Another report on that.
[01:38:14.663 --> 01:38:16.463]  This is out of Investors Business Daily.
[01:38:16.463 --> 01:38:20.745]  La Raza advocacy little more than a scheme to encourage illegals to vote.
[01:38:20.745 --> 01:38:23.646]  Really?
[01:38:23.646 --> 01:38:28.368]  Putting out advisories all over the country with voter guides on where you don't need IDs to vote?
[01:38:29.269 --> 01:38:30.470]  Including what states?
[01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:34.492]  So it's like, you live in this state, but right next door you don't have to have an ID, so get over there.
[01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:40.755]  What?
[01:38:40.755 --> 01:38:41.815]  Look at this headline.
[01:38:41.815 --> 01:38:46.498]  Pelosi Gutierrez, Obama should give temporary amnesty to all illegals.
[01:38:46.498 --> 01:38:47.018]  Yeah!
[01:38:47.018 --> 01:38:49.119]  And then so anybody can get here.
[01:38:49.119 --> 01:38:52.981]  Imagine if Switzerland said, we're just gonna let anybody that can get here, get here.
[01:38:55.347 --> 01:39:00.510]  Actually, nobody would show up because they don't have much of a welfare state, and it's very expensive.
[01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:02.891]  And then he's like, oh, you got $20 million?
[01:39:02.891 --> 01:39:04.992]  Sorry, you can't come to Switzerland.
[01:39:04.992 --> 01:39:07.474]  We want to know what skill you're going to bring.
[01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:10.656]  Oh, you're a scientist that's invented a bunch of stuff?
[01:39:10.656 --> 01:39:12.197]  Oh, please come.
[01:39:12.197 --> 01:39:13.257]  You don't need any money.
[01:39:13.257 --> 01:39:14.098]  Just just come here.
[01:39:14.098 --> 01:39:14.938]  We want your brain.
[01:39:14.938 --> 01:39:20.921]  Oh, boy, everybody's got guns.
[01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.662]  They have the lowest crime rate in the world.
[01:39:22.662 --> 01:39:23.463]  Oh, it's so horrible.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.181]  Maybe I should escape to Switzerland.
[01:39:29.181 --> 01:39:30.061]  I don't have enough money to.
[01:39:30.061 --> 01:39:35.104]  That's what I was thinking.
[01:39:35.104 --> 01:39:36.204]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:39:36.204 --> 01:39:44.809]  Switzerland, when we had Paul Watson and them over there three or four years ago, by the end of it they had members of their cantons marching into the hotel.
[01:39:45.874 --> 01:39:58.345]  And when the Bilderberg security roughed him up, the Swiss police showed up, federal and local, and came in and said, yeah, we're going to go ahead and let a delegation come in and investigate you because you're part of the EU and want to take over Switzerland.
[01:39:58.345 --> 01:40:01.547]  And so all of a sudden, in the middle of the night, helicopters start escaping.
[01:40:01.547 --> 01:40:03.209]  And we bum-rushed it.
[01:40:03.209 --> 01:40:04.790]  It shut down a day early.
[01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:08.813]  And helicopters, dozens and dozens of helicopter flights.
[01:40:08.813 --> 01:40:12.817]  You understand that Switzerland, the cops went in there because they recognized an enemy to their country.
[01:40:14.124 --> 01:40:18.167]  You know, it goes back to William Tell, and that's their archetype there.
[01:40:18.167 --> 01:40:22.271]  William Tell, the whole apple story, that's true.
[01:40:22.271 --> 01:40:25.714]  Shooting the apple off his son's head with the crossbow.
[01:40:25.714 --> 01:40:26.895]  But that's not what he's famous for.
[01:40:28.103 --> 01:40:36.028]  He then went and killed a whole bunch of the foreign usurper who'd come in from another country and was bringing foreigners in to dominate them.
[01:40:36.028 --> 01:40:37.228]  Oh, same thing.
[01:40:37.228 --> 01:40:38.769]  And he went and killed a whole bunch of them.
[01:40:38.769 --> 01:40:40.110]  That's the story William Tell.
[01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:43.592]  So that's in the Swiss soul.
[01:40:43.592 --> 01:40:44.453]  They know that.
[01:40:44.453 --> 01:40:46.194]  That's why they love me and Switzerland.
[01:40:46.194 --> 01:40:47.454]  Not because I'm anything special.
[01:40:47.454 --> 01:40:48.195]  They get it.
[01:40:48.195 --> 01:40:51.897]  Our founding fathers pointed to Switzerland as the model.
[01:40:51.897 --> 01:40:56.280]  Because in 1776, what the Swiss had done was only a hundred years old.
[01:40:57.213 --> 01:40:58.894]  The Dutch had done something similar.
[01:40:58.894 --> 01:41:00.796]  They had that later taken away from them.
[01:41:00.796 --> 01:41:03.337]  Only Switzerland is still somewhat free.
[01:41:03.337 --> 01:41:07.861]  And notice the globalists want to go live where they haven't spoiled everything.
[01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:15.746]  They've gone around and done you-know-what all over our houses, but they keep that little corner clean for them.
[01:41:15.746 --> 01:41:17.347]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:41:17.347 --> 01:41:19.869]  Isn't that just funny?
[01:41:19.869 --> 01:41:22.071]  Guns, low crime, freedom.
[01:41:22.071 --> 01:41:26.494]  But so many rich people move there, it's hard to live there because of the cost of living.
[01:41:27.403 --> 01:41:28.403]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:41:28.403 --> 01:41:31.124]  Let's continue.
[01:41:31.124 --> 01:41:36.346]  Representative Smith of Texas slams use of Obamacare funds to promote amnesty for illegals.
[01:41:36.346 --> 01:41:37.666]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:37.666 --> 01:41:51.910]  By the way, $20 billion has disappeared in secret purchases in just the last two months, NBC News reports.
[01:41:54.372 --> 01:41:57.953]  And just $30,000 of it was Starbucks coffee.
[01:41:57.953 --> 01:42:07.877]  See, we've now reached collapse level, where the feds are now God, and the illegals are their demigod, and they're all above the law, just wallowing in theft.
[01:42:07.877 --> 01:42:14.999]  But if you're a good person in the federal government, and don't play ball with the little crews of black hats, as I call them, the bad guys that have taken over,
[01:42:17.136 --> 01:42:18.217]  They run you out.
[01:42:18.217 --> 01:42:24.901]  Oh, Colonel Schaefer, you use your cell phone to call your wife on 20-something occasions.
[01:42:24.901 --> 01:42:29.724]  We're going to try to indict you because you exposed that we're working with Bin Laden.
[01:42:29.724 --> 01:42:31.265]  That failed.
[01:42:31.265 --> 01:42:40.371]  But imagine, you called your wife 20-something times on your government cell phones for government business, and then they went and said, look, it says you're allowed to call your wife.
[01:42:41.152 --> 01:42:44.913]  But it didn't matter, they could just say he's being looked at for using his phone improperly.
[01:42:44.913 --> 01:42:46.433]  His phone improperly?
[01:42:46.433 --> 01:42:51.655]  To call his wife?
[01:42:51.655 --> 01:42:55.656]  See, calling your wife on your government phone, that's bad.
[01:42:55.656 --> 01:42:56.216]  But you know what?
[01:42:56.216 --> 01:42:59.357]  You want to fund South Africa to create weaponized Ebola to kill black people?
[01:42:59.357 --> 01:43:01.017]  Hey baby, we got your back.
[01:43:07.566 --> 01:43:09.490]  Obama may cut deportations.
[01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:11.113]  Here it is on the Wall Street Journal.
[01:43:11.113 --> 01:43:13.878]  They've already cut them down to nothing.
[01:43:13.878 --> 01:43:15.642]  Mother of man killed by illegals.
[01:43:15.642 --> 01:43:17.205]  President ignoring us completely.
[01:43:17.205 --> 01:43:18.127]  Of course he is.
[01:43:18.127 --> 01:43:19.028]  He's got bodyguards.
[01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:28.294]  I'm going to stop right there and go to some of your phone calls.
[01:43:28.294 --> 01:43:36.838]  But Senator Sessions says the world has been turned upside down, that it's total insanity, that the country is being imploded and turned into a bankrupt society and that we're in a total crisis.
[01:43:36.838 --> 01:43:39.799]  It's a hysterical article he wrote.
[01:43:39.799 --> 01:43:44.481]  And Senator Sessions is absolutely right.
[01:43:44.481 --> 01:43:50.264]  Senate Democrat super lawyers prep for overtime trying to take over the election.
[01:43:50.264 --> 01:43:53.586]  Facebook, Mother Jones pushes for Democrats to vote, data mines.
[01:43:54.659 --> 01:43:56.581]  That's just some of the news that we've got here.
[01:43:56.581 --> 01:43:57.501]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:43:57.501 --> 01:43:58.562]  We'll go to your calls.
[01:43:58.562 --> 01:44:02.125]  Then I've got Joe Biggs' report.
[01:44:02.125 --> 01:44:08.770]  Where he went out to UT and 13 of 20 people signed a petition to let women kill their children up to age 5.
[01:44:10.071 --> 01:44:14.333]  And Joe did a great job, but he basically says in the report these are basically evil people.
[01:44:14.333 --> 01:44:20.975]  I think a lot of them are just so compliant that they'll just sign whatever they're told if they're told it's for a woman or it's for Obama.
[01:44:20.975 --> 01:44:23.416]  Like, stick your hand in a light socket for women.
[01:44:23.416 --> 01:44:23.997]  Absolutely!
[01:44:23.997 --> 01:44:28.058]  You know, turn your guns in or you're racist.
[01:44:28.058 --> 01:44:29.639]  Say you're for Obamacare or you're racist.
[01:44:29.639 --> 01:44:32.240]  Well, there's death panels and it doubles my prices, but you know what?
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.680]  I'm for it!
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.121]  I don't think they're even evil.
[01:44:36.121 --> 01:44:37.282]  They just are jellyfish.
[01:44:38.988 --> 01:44:41.209]  Planet Jellyfish.
[01:44:41.209 --> 01:44:42.529]  We're going to go to your calls.
[01:44:42.529 --> 01:44:58.955]  I just want to remind listeners that we have produced DNA Force, the most hardcore, concentrated, organic, nutraceutical, turbo-charging, bio-PQQ, CoQ10, and all the other
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:01.041]  We're good to go.
[01:45:18.044 --> 01:45:33.019]  Also, Survival Shield X2 group was in here with like 14 different studies, I let him get to it the other day, about what iodine does to the immune system, what it does to viruses, what it did when they tried to give rats the flu, or mice killer flu, and then it would give them iodine and what it would do.
[01:45:33.019 --> 01:45:35.861]  This is the best of the best of the iodine out there from our research.
[01:45:35.861 --> 01:45:36.882]  The creme de la creme.
[01:45:37.863 --> 01:45:38.484]  I don't know.
[01:45:56.966 --> 01:45:57.707]  We have it right now.
[01:45:57.707 --> 01:45:59.808]  We'll ship it right out to you the day after you order it.
[01:45:59.808 --> 01:46:00.809]  Unless it's on the weekend.
[01:46:00.809 --> 01:46:03.371]  If you order it like on Saturday, it'll get shipped out on Monday.
[01:46:03.371 --> 01:46:05.753]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:05.753 --> 01:46:11.037]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:11.037 --> 01:46:16.722]  And we're running a special where you can get 10% off on Survival Shield X2.
[01:46:16.722 --> 01:46:17.543]  No, it's selling out.
[01:46:17.543 --> 01:46:18.103]  We're doing it.
[01:46:18.103 --> 01:46:21.266]  When you get it with Lung Cleanse.
[01:46:21.266 --> 01:46:22.026]  Check that out.
[01:46:22.026 --> 01:46:22.947]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:24.312 --> 01:46:26.112]  There's no promo code, you just get 10% off.
[01:46:26.112 --> 01:46:29.353]  Promo code on everything at Checkout, N-O-W.
[01:46:29.353 --> 01:46:39.435]  Put N-O-W, when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, on any of the InfoWars Life products, and you get 5% off, even when they already have discounts.
[01:46:39.435 --> 01:46:40.435]  And most of them do.
[01:46:40.435 --> 01:46:44.956]  You get 5% off with N-O-W at Checkout, and your purchase supports this transmission.
[01:46:44.956 --> 01:46:50.437]  And people notice, I have better skin, I've lost a ton of weight, I've got more energy, I'm nicer around the office.
[01:46:50.437 --> 01:46:51.477]  Everybody asks, what is it?
[01:46:52.367 --> 01:46:59.210]  It is the group of products that we've developed with Dr. Grip and my dad and others, just off the cutting edge literature and info.
[01:46:59.210 --> 01:47:02.472]  And the truth is, the competition out there isn't competition.
[01:47:02.472 --> 01:47:08.935]  The wellness market, nutrient market just continues to explode as mainline healthcare gets worse and worse.
[01:47:08.935 --> 01:47:17.339]  People don't want, they want to put marketing out and promote something as wonderful, but have what's in the bottle cost $2.
[01:47:17.339 --> 01:47:19.800]  You understand that?
[01:47:21.425 --> 01:47:25.366]  They want to sell it for $20 and have what's in the bottle cost $2.
[01:47:25.366 --> 01:47:31.227]  Well, we sell it for $25 and what's in the bottle costs $12 in one case.
[01:47:31.227 --> 01:47:35.608]  Or what's in our bottle costs $45 and we sell it for $100.
[01:47:35.608 --> 01:47:41.189]  Or what's in the bottle costs us $18 and we sell it for $54.
[01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:44.890]  Still a big markup, but in most supplements there's a seven-fold markup.
[01:47:45.595 --> 01:47:47.556]  We mark it up one time or a time and a half.
[01:47:47.556 --> 01:47:50.558]  Because with overhead running the operation, that sounds like a lot.
[01:47:50.558 --> 01:47:51.418]  It's not.
[01:47:51.418 --> 01:48:00.724]  And the industry's turning heads at us because we want to put out, knock your socks off, super strong, hardcore stuff that the globalists have been targeting and don't want people to know about.
[01:48:01.883 --> 01:48:06.785]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:48:06.785 --> 01:48:11.007]  And your purchase of all these fine products also supports the transmission.
[01:48:11.007 --> 01:48:12.588]  So it's a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:48:12.588 --> 01:48:13.769]  Okay, let's go to calls.
[01:48:13.769 --> 01:48:15.510]  James in California, thanks for calling.
[01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:17.030]  You're on the air.
[01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:21.392]  Hi Alex, I just want to say great work all these years and I'll try and keep it short.
[01:48:21.392 --> 01:48:26.755]  I kind of got a three-step plan to solve the issue.
[01:48:26.755 --> 01:48:28.576]  Number one, go on a vote strike.
[01:48:29.204 --> 01:48:35.725]  Well, the 600, 700 trillion that they say the US owes of the 2.0 or 2 quadrillion, it was 1.5 quadrillion, now it's, according to even the Washington Post, over 2,000
[01:48:59.127 --> 01:49:00.568]  Trillion.
[01:49:00.568 --> 01:49:02.468]  That's hard to say, it's so big.
[01:49:02.468 --> 01:49:10.332]  They claim that over 800, 900, it varies, is owed by the U.S., but our national debt's 18 trillion.
[01:49:10.332 --> 01:49:12.352]  Well, we're capable of living within our own means.
[01:49:12.352 --> 01:49:16.994]  We can feed ourselves, we can clothe ourselves, and we can leave all the water we need.
[01:49:16.994 --> 01:49:24.337]  I agree with you, and that's, they want us domesticated, so, and they're trying to build this panopticon high-tech system where we can't live without them.
[01:49:24.337 --> 01:49:25.318]  God bless your great points.
[01:49:27.623 --> 01:49:32.286]  As for a tax protest, this is a criminal government.
[01:49:32.286 --> 01:49:36.268]  The money's just used to enslave us, especially to the private Federal Reserve.
[01:49:36.268 --> 01:49:38.849]  But this is a criminal group, so I don't advise folks to do it.
[01:49:38.849 --> 01:49:39.950]  That's your decision.
[01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:43.131]  If you make that decision, more power to you.
[01:49:43.131 --> 01:49:44.952]  They say 60 million people don't file now.
[01:49:44.952 --> 01:49:45.512]  Folks are done.
[01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:46.833]  They see the illegals above the law?
[01:49:46.833 --> 01:49:48.274]  Well, they're above the law too, I guess.
[01:49:48.274 --> 01:49:49.475]  The government's above the law?
[01:49:49.475 --> 01:49:50.795]  Google doesn't pay tax?
[01:49:50.795 --> 01:49:52.476]  General Electric doesn't pay tax?
[01:49:52.476 --> 01:49:53.897]  All these globalists don't pay tax?
[01:49:53.897 --> 01:49:54.237]  Fine.
[01:49:54.237 --> 01:49:54.557]  Whatever.
[01:49:54.557 --> 01:49:55.298]  Do whatever you're going to do.
[01:49:55.298 --> 01:49:55.918]  That's your decision.
[01:49:57.401 --> 01:50:03.627]  But as for what you raise about repudiating the debt, let's not miss the forest of the trees.
[01:50:03.627 --> 01:50:06.649]  Our national debt is approaching $19 trillion.
[01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:11.574]  It's untenable, it's insane, most of it's fraud, most of it's interest.
[01:50:11.574 --> 01:50:19.941]  Real, what we owe long term with Social Security, all these other debts, $100 trillion?
[01:50:19.941 --> 01:50:22.623]  So let's say we really owe $100 trillion.
[01:50:22.623 --> 01:50:23.904]  Why are they saying it's $900 trillion?
[01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:28.772]  Because we were signed on to derivatives in 2008.
[01:50:28.772 --> 01:50:32.116]  It wasn't about the quote bailout of 867 billion.
[01:50:32.116 --> 01:50:34.018]  That was an open window.
[01:50:34.018 --> 01:50:36.261]  They got 50-something trillion last time I checked out of that.
[01:50:38.007 --> 01:50:45.070]  What we're talking about here is that they've signed us on to 800 trillion that is indisputably not our debt.
[01:50:45.070 --> 01:50:46.650]  No, no, no, it's not ours.
[01:50:46.650 --> 01:50:48.351]  You're absolutely right.
[01:50:48.351 --> 01:50:52.093]  All right, we're going to come back and go to Jack in Florida, Ron in Canada.
[01:50:52.093 --> 01:50:56.895]  We're going to go to Jersey and others.
[01:50:56.895 --> 01:50:57.695]  Jennifer, stay with us.

[01:51:33.588 --> 01:51:35.229]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:35.229 --> 01:51:38.071]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:38.071 --> 01:51:40.352]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:40.352 --> 01:51:44.855]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:51:52.899 --> 01:51:54.640]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:52:00.071 --> 01:52:02.913]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:52:02.913 --> 01:52:08.038]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:52:08.038 --> 01:52:15.864]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:52:16.144 --> 01:52:20.665]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:52:20.665 --> 01:52:24.647]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:52:24.647 --> 01:52:30.588]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:52:30.588 --> 01:52:33.749]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:52:33.749 --> 01:52:38.911]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:52:39.111 --> 01:52:47.297]  Go to MyPatriotsSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:53:50.257 --> 01:53:50.317]  800-325-6384.
[01:53:50.317 --> 01:53:51.937]  Well, the Feds have stolen $20 million the last two months.
[01:53:51.937 --> 01:53:52.837]  Won't say where the money went.
[01:54:13.012 --> 01:54:18.395]  NBC says it was for, like, clothing and watches and Starbucks coffee.
[01:54:18.395 --> 01:54:19.975]  No one will get in trouble.
[01:54:19.975 --> 01:54:22.356]  Huge fire at French public radio building in Paris.
[01:54:22.356 --> 01:54:24.257]  They say it could be terrorism.
[01:54:24.257 --> 01:54:25.638]  Folks were asking what I thought of that.
[01:54:25.638 --> 01:54:26.398]  We don't know yet.
[01:54:26.398 --> 01:54:30.400]  Might just be a loving Al-Qaeda operative or something.
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:35.162]  I mean, our government and the French helped fund them, so what do they expect?
[01:54:35.162 --> 01:54:37.624]  Let's go to Jack in Florida.
[01:54:37.624 --> 01:54:39.304]  Jack, you're on the air talking about election 2014.
[01:54:39.304 --> 01:54:40.465]  Thanks for calling.
[01:54:42.011 --> 01:54:44.873]  Yeah, Alex, to start with, thanks for the X2.
[01:54:44.873 --> 01:54:48.475]  I've been taking it and it seems like it has been working.
[01:54:48.475 --> 01:54:53.077]  Anyway, what I'm calling about, I live here in Florida.
[01:54:53.077 --> 01:54:57.080]  Everybody in Florida here has been shafted here on this governor's race.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:04.564]  We've had two or three debates here on the governor's race in Florida and they wouldn't even let the Libertarian
[01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:08.431]  His name is Adrian Wiley.
[01:55:08.431 --> 01:55:10.552]  They wouldn't even let him in the debates.
[01:55:10.552 --> 01:55:13.574]  I mean, everybody in the state has been short-changed.
[01:55:13.574 --> 01:55:17.396]  This fella, we got four more days to the election.
[01:55:17.396 --> 01:55:21.058]  Everybody that hasn't voted, anyway, needs to get out and check this fella out.
[01:55:21.058 --> 01:55:24.539]  Here, he's going to be able to, everybody on here knows what the cap for it is.
[01:55:24.539 --> 01:55:26.620]  He does, also.
[01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:29.902]  Check all these departments in this state out.
[01:55:29.902 --> 01:55:31.663]  On top of that, he's going to be able to give a 100%
[01:55:34.617 --> 01:55:37.700]  Homestead exemption on a house that you live in.
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:38.160]  That's right.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:48.828]  And not only have they exempted him, because David Knight interviewed him on the Nightly News last week, he is polling 10% or 12% and they still kept him out of the debates.
[01:55:48.828 --> 01:55:55.934]  Because if he got up on a debate and said, we'll give you 100% homestead exemption, you would actually own your house.
[01:55:55.934 --> 01:55:59.056]  Until 100 years ago, folks, you actually owned your house.
[01:55:59.056 --> 01:56:00.698]  Not even the king of England could come in it.
[01:56:02.177 --> 01:56:06.340]  That ain't our way of looking at it.
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:10.222]  He's against these private prisons we've got going on all over the country.
[01:56:22.805 --> 01:56:24.926]  I'm just glad to get on here to get the word out.
[01:56:24.926 --> 01:56:26.507]  Everybody needs to check this dude out.
[01:56:26.507 --> 01:56:29.109]  His name's Adrian Wiley.
[01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:32.751]  Go up on your Google or StartPage or whatever you use.
[01:56:32.751 --> 01:56:34.032]  Check him out.
[01:56:34.032 --> 01:56:35.193]  Go vote for him.
[01:56:35.193 --> 01:56:41.957]  Anyway, it's a chance we got here in Florida if people could actually know he's running and what he stands for.
[01:56:41.957 --> 01:56:43.819]  Anyway, thanks Alex.
[01:56:43.819 --> 01:56:44.459]  Thank you sir.
[01:56:44.459 --> 01:56:44.979]  Great point.
[01:56:44.979 --> 01:56:49.702]  You just got me excited when you brought that up because here he is getting 10 to 12 points in the polls.
[01:56:49.702 --> 01:56:51.644]  Massive for a Libertarian.
[01:56:52.671 --> 01:56:58.053]  They know he could end up winning, so they just don't tell you about him.
[01:56:58.053 --> 01:57:00.714]  That's an example of how sick this is.
[01:57:00.714 --> 01:57:01.715]  Ron in Canada.
[01:57:01.715 --> 01:57:02.295]  You're on the air.
[01:57:02.295 --> 01:57:02.675]  Go ahead.
[01:57:02.675 --> 01:57:07.077]  How are you doing?
[01:57:07.077 --> 01:57:07.517]  Good, brother.
[01:57:07.517 --> 01:57:08.558]  Go ahead.
[01:57:08.558 --> 01:57:08.798]  Good.
[01:57:08.798 --> 01:57:10.558]  I'm glad I got a hold of you today, Alex.
[01:57:10.558 --> 01:57:11.859]  I want to say something about the election.
[01:57:12.878 --> 01:57:17.921]  Okay, I live in Canada, so I know some people think it's no big deal for me, but it is.
[01:57:17.921 --> 01:57:21.423]  I follow it just as closely as I would my own Canadian Parliament.
[01:57:21.423 --> 01:57:23.785]  I think that elections are going to be rigged.
[01:57:23.785 --> 01:57:27.487]  There's no question in my mind, especially with the new computer systems they got in place.
[01:57:27.487 --> 01:57:30.429]  I've seen some of the trials with the software developers.
[01:57:30.429 --> 01:57:33.131]  I know that these guys have put so many backdoors in these programs.
[01:57:33.559 --> 01:57:37.222]  There's room for rigging elections and all kinds of stuff.
[01:57:37.222 --> 01:57:44.489]  Obama's getting away with, or sorry, Obolo is getting away with way, way too much.
[01:57:44.489 --> 01:57:50.514]  Well, we know they're legalizing illegals outside of law by executive fiat.
[01:57:50.514 --> 01:57:54.317]  If that isn't impeachable, if that isn't illegal, I don't know what is.
[01:57:54.317 --> 01:57:57.140]  And so we know there's massive fraud going on right there.
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:58.241]  So I agree with you that
[01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:15.956]  We're going to see massive manipulation, but as Bev Harris and other experts on electronic voting have said, it's hard for electronic voting to beat landslides, because the exit polls and things don't match, and the establishment's a little skiddy of that.
[01:58:15.956 --> 01:58:18.357]  They steal close elections.
[01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:19.738]  They steal a lot of local...
[01:58:21.957 --> 01:58:23.897]  Crop issues, too.
[01:58:23.897 --> 01:58:24.538]  But I hear you.
[01:58:24.538 --> 01:58:37.601]  We'll be watching that this Sunday with live coverage and next Monday and Tuesday we're going to be broadcasting for at least 10 hours extra coming up on Tuesday in the lead up on InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:58:37.601 --> 01:58:38.861]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.861 --> 01:58:40.021]  Next hour coming up.
[01:58:40.021 --> 01:58:43.602]  Warrior Calls straight ahead.
[01:58:43.602 --> 01:58:47.343]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.851 --> 01:58:53.493]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:53.493 --> 01:58:54.974]  Check it out today.
[01:58:54.974 --> 01:59:00.739]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none.
[01:59:00.739 --> 01:59:03.361]  And that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:03.361 --> 01:59:10.486]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[01:59:10.526 --> 01:59:11.146]  We're good to go.
[01:59:31.277 --> 01:59:32.597]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:06.741 --> 02:00:11.562]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.562 --> 02:00:13.143]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.143 --> 02:00:14.703]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.703 --> 02:00:18.884]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.884 --> 02:00:26.486]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.486 --> 02:00:28.147]  Dr. Joseph Mercola's coming up.
[02:00:28.147 --> 02:00:31.048]  We'll also take some of your phone calls.
[02:00:31.048 --> 02:00:32.428]  Right now, we're talking election.
[02:00:32.428 --> 02:00:33.928]  Pete in New Jersey, thanks for calling.
[02:00:33.928 --> 02:00:34.889]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:34.889 --> 02:00:35.689]  You're on the air, Pete.
[02:00:37.085 --> 02:00:38.146]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:00:38.146 --> 02:00:39.087]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:00:39.087 --> 02:00:40.188]  Hey, I'm a longtime listener.
[02:00:40.188 --> 02:00:47.155]  I've got two quick observations, a very quick action plan, and a quick historical quote that I'd like to upload today, if I can.
[02:00:47.155 --> 02:00:54.282]  My observation number one, this election on Tuesday, in my view, is the most important election in the history of the United States of America.
[02:00:54.282 --> 02:00:55.564]  This, well,
[02:00:56.184 --> 02:01:02.366]  Could very well be our last opportunity for a peaceful and political change and turning of the tide in this country.
[02:01:02.366 --> 02:01:03.786]  Observation number two.
[02:01:03.786 --> 02:01:24.133]  If this election goes the wrong way, in my view, the Bush-Clinton crime family will be one step closer to reaching their objective, namely the takedown and destruction of the republic on behalf of their globalist, elitist masters as their price for the promise of admittance into the next level of the globalist power structure.
[02:01:25.259 --> 02:01:28.422]  These individuals are not only traitors, they are fools.
[02:01:28.422 --> 02:01:29.063]  Okay?
[02:01:29.063 --> 02:01:30.224]  Here's my action plan.
[02:01:30.224 --> 02:01:35.048]  This election, in my view, needs to be a national referendum on the following two questions.
[02:01:35.882 --> 02:01:54.028]  I'll get to that in a moment, because before I talk about the questions, I'm issuing a clarion call to all info warriors and citizen journalists to get into the face of every politician running for election on Tuesday, especially those running for governor, senate, or the congress, with these two very simple yes or no questions.
[02:01:54.028 --> 02:02:01.651]  Question number one, do you support the immediate ban on all commercial flights from Ebola-stricken West Coast African nations?
[02:02:01.651 --> 02:02:02.431]  Yes or no?
[02:02:02.431 --> 02:02:03.812]  It's a simple question.
[02:02:03.812 --> 02:02:04.592]  Question number two,
[02:02:05.112 --> 02:02:28.504]  If elected, and this is especially for those running for Congress, House or the Senate, if elected, will you pursue all legal remedies to stop the implementation of the illegal, unconstitutional, dictatorial, executable order that the President has clearly stated he will sign to grant blanket amnesty to illegal aliens in the United States?
[02:02:28.504 --> 02:02:29.585]  Yes or no?
[02:02:29.585 --> 02:02:31.666]  It's a simple question, okay?
[02:02:33.147 --> 02:02:37.230]  The politician running for office needs to be put on the public record.
[02:02:37.230 --> 02:02:42.174]  No one but info warriors and citizen journalists will be asking those types of questions.
[02:02:42.174 --> 02:02:46.617]  They need to be caught on camera and their positions need to be clearly known.
[02:02:46.617 --> 02:02:48.618]  Okay, here's my historical quote.
[02:02:48.618 --> 02:02:50.520]  I'm going to catch my breath.
[02:02:53.209 --> 02:03:07.172]  As if through the mists of time, well beyond the grave, echoes the last and final standing order from our country's first commander-in-chief, and I quote, there is but one straight course.
[02:03:07.839 --> 02:03:11.582]  And that is to seek truth and pursue it steadily.
[02:03:11.582 --> 02:03:12.803]  George Washington.
[02:03:12.803 --> 02:03:14.485]  Oh, I love George Washington.
[02:03:14.485 --> 02:03:17.767]  Well, I tell you, brother, we in the future are going to have auxiliary reporters.
[02:03:17.767 --> 02:03:19.909]  We don't have the money to hire them full-time, part-time.
[02:03:19.909 --> 02:03:24.093]  You're the type of guy that, send us your resume, send us some info.
[02:03:24.093 --> 02:03:28.396]  Pete from New Jersey, you're a very super articulate guy.
[02:03:28.396 --> 02:03:29.857]  I wish I was like you.
[02:03:29.857 --> 02:03:32.500]  In fact, that's what we should thematically
[02:03:33.717 --> 02:03:46.501]  Call our election coverage next Monday and Tuesday on the nightly news in here is referendum on Obama, referendum on tyranny, referendum will we totally reject.
[02:03:46.501 --> 02:03:51.683]  They're saying this to be the biggest landslide in history in the US.
[02:03:51.683 --> 02:03:53.404]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[02:03:54.395 --> 02:04:07.509]  And if you do see Democrats turn on Obama, because they understand he is absolutely destroying this country, then that is a referendum against globalism and the New World Order, and will send shockwaves around the world.
[02:04:08.533 --> 02:04:17.640]  That's why the foreign banks that only come here for F1, a lot of them are in my city right now, these globalists, they only come here once or twice a year.
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:19.742]  They don't care if we're turning to a third world country.
[02:04:19.742 --> 02:04:22.684]  They want us bankrupted to politically control us.
[02:04:22.684 --> 02:04:24.805]  And so, Pete, real quick, tell us about yourself.
[02:04:24.805 --> 02:04:25.166]  What do you do?
[02:04:25.879 --> 02:04:29.581]  Well, Alex, I have one thing that I'd like to share.
[02:04:29.581 --> 02:04:30.922]  Okay, I got it.
[02:04:30.922 --> 02:04:32.963]  My father used to say one thing very important.
[02:04:32.963 --> 02:04:34.885]  There are three kinds of people in this world.
[02:04:34.885 --> 02:04:36.906]  Workers, beggars, and thieves.
[02:04:36.906 --> 02:04:41.629]  And right now, the thieves and the beggars are working together to suck the lifeblood out of working Americans.
[02:04:42.029 --> 02:04:42.670]  That's it.
[02:04:42.670 --> 02:04:49.118]  And then they hit us on the head, the workers on the head, the beggars and the thieves, and we say, hey, stop sucking my blood.
[02:04:49.118 --> 02:04:50.740]  They go, shut up, racister.
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:51.821]  Shut up, homophober.
[02:04:51.821 --> 02:04:54.444]  You don't like women because you don't like Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:54.444 --> 02:04:57.107]  I don't like criminals, and I don't like being a slave.
[02:04:57.107 --> 02:04:57.888]  God bless you, brother.
[02:04:57.888 --> 02:04:58.589]  Send us your info.
[02:04:58.589 --> 02:04:59.791]  You might be a good auxiliary reporter.
[02:05:00.765 --> 02:05:02.086]  The experts are clear.
[02:05:02.086 --> 02:05:09.192]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:05:09.192 --> 02:05:15.478]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[02:05:15.478 --> 02:05:19.041]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:05:19.201 --> 02:05:23.423]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:05:23.423 --> 02:05:28.726]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:05:28.726 --> 02:05:29.746]  Not our iodine.
[02:05:29.746 --> 02:05:33.548]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:05:33.548 --> 02:05:36.089]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:11.385]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:06:11.385 --> 02:06:17.828]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:06:17.828 --> 02:06:20.189]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:06:20.189 --> 02:06:23.270]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:30.133]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:06:30.655 --> 02:06:34.316]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:06:34.316 --> 02:06:38.597]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:06:38.597 --> 02:06:40.357]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:06:40.357 --> 02:06:45.698]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[02:06:45.698 --> 02:06:48.219]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:06:48.219 --> 02:06:49.359]  But for how long?
[02:06:49.359 --> 02:06:51.579]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:06:51.579 --> 02:06:56.000]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.861]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:06:57.861 --> 02:06:58.821]  Just won't quit.
[02:07:00.427 --> 02:07:10.091]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:07:10.091 --> 02:07:20.016]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:07:20.016 --> 02:07:22.937]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[02:07:23.137 --> 02:07:23.417]  I think?
[02:07:38.114 --> 02:07:38.354]  We're good.
[02:08:17.163 --> 02:08:22.665]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:22.665 --> 02:08:32.428]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:32.428 --> 02:08:35.869]  Now, for the rest of the hour, Dr. Joseph Mercola is our guest.
[02:08:35.869 --> 02:08:42.892]  We're going to be talking Ebola, cancer rates in this country, but also we're going to talk some about the election.
[02:08:42.892 --> 02:08:43.432]  Get his take.
[02:08:44.662 --> 02:08:53.370]  I guess from a non-partisan position about where this world's going and I promise we'll go to some of the callers that are holding as well at the bottom of the hour like Frogo in England.
[02:08:53.370 --> 02:08:56.974]  You can just address your comment and then ask any health question you've got.
[02:08:56.974 --> 02:09:02.459]  Dr. Mercola and then we'll go to Jennifer, Angel, Nick and Jordy.
[02:09:02.459 --> 02:09:06.283]  That'll be it for calls you've been already holding so I'll go to you.
[02:09:06.283 --> 02:09:07.404]  Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[02:09:08.621 --> 02:09:13.963]  If people know anything about health, anything about alternative wellness and news, they know about Dr. Mercola.
[02:09:13.963 --> 02:09:23.507]  He's probably the most successful one name out there at putting out really good reference material and also being very moderate about the claims and things he says.
[02:09:24.367 --> 02:09:30.171]  Mercola.com is the most visited natural health website averaging 14 million visitors monthly.
[02:09:30.171 --> 02:09:31.711]  I think it's more than that.
[02:09:31.711 --> 02:09:38.976]  His mission is to ignite a transformation of our fatally flawed healthcare system and to inspire people to take control of their health.
[02:09:39.836 --> 02:09:45.798]  And he is a passionate about health and technology for most of his life, a doctor of osteopathic medicine.
[02:09:45.798 --> 02:09:49.078]  He treated many thousands of patients for over 20 years.
[02:09:49.078 --> 02:09:59.241]  In the mid-1990s, he integrated his passion for natural health with modern technology via the internet, developing the website Mercola.com to spread the word about natural ways to achieve optimal health.
[02:10:00.049 --> 02:10:05.594]  He has significant milestones in his mission to bring people practical solutions to their health problems.
[02:10:05.594 --> 02:10:07.276]  New York Times bestselling author.
[02:10:07.276 --> 02:10:14.082]  He's also voted the 2009 Ultimate Wellness Game Changer by the Huffington Post and has been featured in Time Magazine and everywhere else.
[02:10:14.082 --> 02:10:16.824]  I'm not going to go over it.
[02:10:16.824 --> 02:10:20.488]  He joins us now to cover the waterfront, basically.
[02:10:20.488 --> 02:10:22.450]  Dr. Mercola, thanks for coming on on Halloween.
[02:10:23.234 --> 02:10:25.758]  Yeah, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:10:25.758 --> 02:10:29.505]  I missed you out in September at the Health Liberty Awards.
[02:10:29.505 --> 02:10:33.011]  Well, I would love to be able to go to stuff like that, but I'm always tied down here in the bunker.
[02:10:35.526 --> 02:10:47.829]  You know, I've been trying to actually follow some of what I preach, and I've gotten a lot healthier and lost about, all total in the last few years, about 50 pounds, but I don't look as glowing as you or some of the other folks that really take care of themselves.
[02:10:47.829 --> 02:10:50.750]  Let's, out of the gates, talk about Ebola.
[02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:52.730]  Then I want to talk about the state of labeling.
[02:10:52.730 --> 02:10:55.991]  I know you helped spearhead the prop that almost passed in California.
[02:10:55.991 --> 02:10:57.411]  There's other props.
[02:10:57.411 --> 02:11:00.292]  McDonald's... ...in Washington, and this year in Oregon and Colorado.
[02:11:01.132 --> 02:11:02.773]  Yes, there's a lot to cover.
[02:11:02.773 --> 02:11:09.015]  What is your researched expert take on what's currently happening with Ebola?
[02:11:09.015 --> 02:11:28.524]  Well, my belief is that, and no one knows for sure, but it's just my take on it, that it's an orchestrated effort to create a fear, you know, it's their common strategy, great fear, to use as a justification to initiate a massive vaccination program.
[02:11:28.524 --> 02:11:30.025]  That's clearly the endgame here.
[02:11:31.866 --> 02:11:38.512]  I mean, this disease is highly infectious, of course, but it's not taking out a lot of people in the United States.
[02:11:38.512 --> 02:11:41.315]  There's only been two nurses who've been infected.
[02:11:41.315 --> 02:11:43.517]  There's other people who are infected.
[02:11:43.517 --> 02:11:49.222]  I mean, in the United States, there's other people who have been infected who are coming in from Africa.
[02:11:49.222 --> 02:11:51.344]  So I don't think a lot of people are going to die here.
[02:11:51.344 --> 02:11:56.449]  I don't think it's a serious issue, but they're going to use it as leverage to initiate a massive vaccination campaign.
[02:11:57.543 --> 02:12:00.685]  That's clearly what they're doing, and they've got the vaccine lined up to come.
[02:12:00.685 --> 02:12:07.290]  Well, several vaccines for December, January, February, right as this starts to peak in Africa.
[02:12:07.290 --> 02:12:10.813]  Looking at it, we know that South Africa developed race-specific Ebola.
[02:12:10.813 --> 02:12:11.473]  They admit that.
[02:12:11.473 --> 02:12:13.955]  It was declassified in hearings back in the mid-90s.
[02:12:13.955 --> 02:12:16.677]  Now, this Ebola clearly has mutated.
[02:12:16.677 --> 02:12:19.459]  It lasts longer in the body.
[02:12:19.459 --> 02:12:23.723]  I think people are scared of it, because if it gets here,
[02:12:24.523 --> 02:12:29.327]  And then starts to go somewhat airborne, as the Army has said, in colder weather, it can live longer.
[02:12:29.327 --> 02:12:30.928]  Then it could be a big problem.
[02:12:30.928 --> 02:12:34.171]  I think it's the bleeding and the rest of it that scares people.
[02:12:34.171 --> 02:12:41.317]  But I agree with you, the government's response, the way they've acted, I think adds to the fear.
[02:12:41.317 --> 02:12:47.362]  How do you think they're going to try to roll out this forced vaccination program or this attempt to fearmonger people into doing it?
[02:12:48.651 --> 02:12:59.118]  I'm not too good at projecting the future, but I do know that I very confidently can tell your listeners and viewers that there's nothing to be afraid about here.
[02:12:59.118 --> 02:13:00.179]  Just look at the facts.
[02:13:00.179 --> 02:13:06.824]  I mean, it definitely is a highly virulent virus that kills a large percentage of people in Africa, but look at the people it's killing.
[02:13:06.824 --> 02:13:11.247]  These are highly malnourished individuals, protein, calorie malnutrition for the most part.
[02:13:11.867 --> 02:13:12.048]  Thank you!
[02:13:32.731 --> 02:13:43.338]  That will do it naturally and that's not possible as it will be in the winter months and oral vitamin D certainly, but realize that that's clearly inferior to sun exposure.
[02:13:43.338 --> 02:13:45.279]  And then the second one would be 80%.
[02:13:45.279 --> 02:13:52.304]  80% of your immune system, Alex, is in your gut, your gut microbiome.
[02:13:52.304 --> 02:13:56.887]  So simple measures like stopping sugar, avoiding
[02:13:57.438 --> 02:13:57.618]  Yeah.
[02:14:17.406 --> 02:14:17.906]  I think so.
[02:14:38.362 --> 02:14:40.884]  You don't need a lot of fancy stuff.
[02:14:40.884 --> 02:14:52.632]  And for whatever reason, you're stressed out, you're not sleeping well, you do get sick, there's simple measures that you can do that really address this, that you don't have to rely on medications.
[02:14:52.632 --> 02:15:00.038]  You know, there's simple therapies like certainly liposomal vitamin C, colloidal silver, and even ozone therapy, which
[02:15:00.878 --> 02:15:13.665]  I did a recent interview with Dr. Robert Rowan who went to Sierra Leone, just got back last week, because the president of Sierra Leone invited him to the country to use ozone therapy to treat Ebola there.
[02:15:13.665 --> 02:15:19.608]  But then the drug companies got aware of it and they got kicked out last week, unfortunately.
[02:15:19.608 --> 02:15:25.572]  But he was able to train a lot of physicians there and most likely some of the ozone therapy trials will start soon.
[02:15:26.536 --> 02:15:43.770]  Think how powerful these drug companies are, that they can block colloidal silver, they can block ozone treatments, they can block things that are known in the government's own research to have massive effects, all because they want to be the saviors to sell the Ebola vaccine or the Ebola drugs.
[02:15:43.770 --> 02:15:47.754]  There's just got to be some way to break their monopoly of control.
[02:15:49.161 --> 02:15:49.962]  Well, there is a way.
[02:15:49.962 --> 02:15:54.405]  There's a very clear way, and that is to take control of your health.
[02:15:54.405 --> 02:16:02.972]  To be empowered to understand that you don't have to rely on expensive drugs or surgeries to address the causes of disease.
[02:16:02.972 --> 02:16:04.393]  There are natural options.
[02:16:04.393 --> 02:16:14.421]  Many of them are inexpensive or virtually free that could radically improve your ability to stay healthy and not rely on these alternatives.
[02:16:14.421 --> 02:16:17.384]  It's really bizarro world, Dr. Mercola.
[02:16:17.384 --> 02:16:17.564]  Yeah.
[02:16:19.212 --> 02:16:32.732]  People like Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are, could put a paper out six years ago saying we should restrict free speech and he gave an example of what was damaging speech and he said sunshine is not good for you.
[02:16:35.598 --> 02:16:48.275]  Yeah, and now the Surgeon General, who is a former dermatologist, or still is a dermatologist, but he's massively come against that and tried to integrate into the United States public health policy to avoid the sun.
[02:16:48.275 --> 02:16:52.041]  I mean, it's just so highly irrational.
[02:16:53.069 --> 02:16:54.570]  Well, they don't want us to be well.
[02:16:54.570 --> 02:17:03.335]  See, you're a classy, smart guy, and you're very conservative in your approach at not being hysterical, but come on.
[02:17:03.335 --> 02:17:05.716]  We've got governments with all their secret lethal tests.
[02:17:05.716 --> 02:17:07.677]  They've been caught over and over again.
[02:17:07.677 --> 02:17:20.805]  When they come out and say, don't get sun, you don't need any sun, when any old-fashioned doctor would say, you're sick, go get sun, when anybody can read the thousands of studies that you've got to get moderate sun or you'll basically get cancer, they just
[02:17:22.066 --> 02:17:26.089]  They want us sick, dying, or dead, I guess.
[02:17:26.089 --> 02:17:29.232]  Well, I'm not sure that's the ultimate motivation of most physicians.
[02:17:29.232 --> 02:17:33.715]  I think that, you know, having been trained as a physician, I could... No, no, no, I don't think the average one.
[02:17:33.715 --> 02:17:35.637]  I'm talking about the big policy makers.
[02:17:35.637 --> 02:17:37.098]  Oh, the big... I couldn't agree more.
[02:17:37.098 --> 02:17:44.144]  Yeah, there's definitely a consistent effort in that direction.
[02:17:44.144 --> 02:17:46.186]  But the policy... Who controls the policy makers?
[02:17:46.246 --> 02:17:56.675]  You know, there's this revolving door of federal regulatory agencies that are bought off by lobbyists from these large corporations, frequently the drug companies, that dictate these policies.
[02:17:56.675 --> 02:18:02.901]  Yeah, for those that don't know, that's a great example about an Africa not letting doctors go in with ozone systems.
[02:18:02.901 --> 02:18:05.523]  Look at Codex Alimentarius and the UN.
[02:18:05.523 --> 02:18:09.006]  It's run by the multinational corporations that run the UN board.
[02:18:09.824 --> 02:18:17.659]  Yeah, and it's been successfully implemented from large measure in Europe and thankfully we've got tremendously great organizations like American
[02:18:19.348 --> 02:18:20.069]  I believe it is.
[02:18:20.069 --> 02:18:28.135]  I forget what the acronym stands for, but they're using political lobbying to prevent those laws from being implemented in the United States.
[02:18:28.135 --> 02:18:30.376]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:18:30.376 --> 02:18:36.200]  It's almost impossible to find a natural health care clinician in England, or even find any supplement that's useful.
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:38.522]  I mean, they're limited to vitamin D to 400 units.
[02:18:38.522 --> 02:18:39.122]  You'd have to take
[02:18:43.806 --> 02:18:45.787]  10, 15, 20 a day to get the right dose.
[02:18:45.787 --> 02:18:54.133]  And let's be clear, they jack the price up, they cut the allowance down to almost nothing, and say, oh you don't need iodine, oh you don't need vitamin D, oh you don't.
[02:18:54.133 --> 02:19:02.298]  Listen to these people that say you need vitamins, that you need minerals, but they're lowering the RDA down and down and down.
[02:19:02.298 --> 02:19:02.999]  What's behind that?
[02:19:05.808 --> 02:19:11.372]  Well, I'm not aware that they're lowering specific RDAs, but those are just guidelines.
[02:19:11.372 --> 02:19:15.435]  The key is to understand that you need healthy food.
[02:19:15.435 --> 02:19:23.401]  One of my big new passions is to encourage and inspire people to really start growing their own food, even if it's something as simple as sprouts.
[02:19:23.401 --> 02:19:29.325]  You could have a significant portion of your food intake from sprouts that you can graze from seed in about 7 to 10 days.
[02:19:29.325 --> 02:19:30.966]  It's organic.
[02:19:30.966 --> 02:19:32.928]  It's really healthy.
[02:19:33.388 --> 02:19:34.149]  Stay there, Dr. Mercola.
[02:19:34.149 --> 02:19:39.994]  We're going to come back and I'm going to look it up, but I remember having some of the folks on that have been there reporting from Codex Alimentarius and seeing it.
[02:19:39.994 --> 02:19:42.696]  They are lobbying to continue to actually lower in Europe.
[02:19:42.696 --> 02:19:44.837]  I don't mean here, but they've done it.
[02:19:44.837 --> 02:19:50.162]  Lower what they're saying you can basically sell on these store shelves.
[02:19:50.162 --> 02:19:51.042]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:51.042 --> 02:19:52.524]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:19:52.524 --> 02:19:54.865]  Dr. Mercola of Mercola.com is our guest.
[02:19:54.865 --> 02:19:55.246]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.882 --> 02:20:06.745]  This winter, next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[02:20:06.745 --> 02:20:08.687]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[02:20:08.687 --> 02:20:17.012]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel can be safely stored with your other supplies for many years and works in any gas-powered vehicle or backup generator.
[02:20:17.012 --> 02:20:22.715]  With the bitterly cold temperatures predicted for this winter, now is the best time to stock up on spare fuel.
[02:20:22.715 --> 02:20:25.316]  So, go to GetSpareFuel.com.
[02:20:25.316 --> 02:20:27.418]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.
[02:20:27.418 --> 02:20:29.179]  GetSpareFuel.com.
[02:20:31.184 --> 02:20:32.184]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:20:32.184 --> 02:20:35.627]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:20:35.627 --> 02:20:37.308]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:20:37.308 --> 02:20:39.250]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:20:39.250 --> 02:20:45.094]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:20:45.094 --> 02:20:45.935]  I know, right?
[02:20:45.935 --> 02:20:47.236]  You love it, too!
[02:20:47.236 --> 02:20:48.677]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:20:48.677 --> 02:20:49.718]  Let's go get some!
[02:20:49.718 --> 02:20:51.459]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[02:20:51.459 --> 02:20:51.800]  That's 877-886-3653.
[02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:52.760]  Or visit GoBerkey.com.
[02:21:00.370 --> 02:21:03.452]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[02:21:03.452 --> 02:21:05.233]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[02:21:05.233 --> 02:21:07.714]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[02:21:07.714 --> 02:21:09.315]  And your rights are at risk.
[02:21:09.315 --> 02:21:13.677]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[02:21:13.677 --> 02:21:15.838]  KD Armor is standing up for you.
[02:21:15.838 --> 02:21:18.960]  We offer the most affordable Level 3 body armor on the market.
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:23.402]  KD Level 3 Armor withstands pistol and rifle hits up to 7.62 NATO.

[02:21:27.544 --> 02:21:28.344]  KD Armor.
[02:21:28.344 --> 02:21:29.185]  Come and take it.
[02:21:30.563 --> 02:21:32.004]  It's already too late.
[02:21:32.004 --> 02:21:34.665]  Criminals have kicked in your door and are now in your home.
[02:21:34.665 --> 02:21:36.845]  Before this happens, homeowners have a choice.
[02:21:36.845 --> 02:21:41.067]  One, do nothing and hope you aren't one of the 1.4 million families attacked each year.
[02:21:41.067 --> 02:21:46.129]  Or two, refuse to be a victim and for as low as $59, reinforce your doors with DoorDevils.
[02:21:46.129 --> 02:21:51.751]  DoorDevils simply attach to existing door frames and have proven to stop the biggest bad guys from kicking in doors.

[02:21:55.113 --> 02:21:56.633]  Alarms don't stop kick-ins.

[02:21:57.253 --> 02:21:58.294]  DoorDevil.com.
[02:22:00.151 --> 02:22:05.513]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[02:22:05.513 --> 02:22:09.355]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[02:22:09.355 --> 02:22:14.517]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[02:22:14.517 --> 02:22:16.418]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[02:22:16.418 --> 02:22:19.880]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:22.741]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:22:23.422 --> 02:22:29.411]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:22:29.411 --> 02:22:36.441]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:22:36.441 --> 02:22:38.805]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[02:22:39.494 --> 02:22:43.316]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[02:22:43.316 --> 02:22:44.237]  Wow!
[02:22:44.237 --> 02:22:44.797]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:24:17.787 --> 02:24:20.009]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:20.009 --> 02:24:20.670]  I'm your host.
[02:24:20.670 --> 02:24:24.153]  I'll be back live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:24:24.153 --> 02:24:28.877]  Central Time with a Sunday edition and back live next Monday Lord willing 11 a.m.
[02:24:28.877 --> 02:24:29.577]  to 2 p.m.
[02:24:29.577 --> 02:24:41.887]  Central Standard Time and then we're gonna have extended coverage for about an hour and a half maybe two hours Monday night normally in Fuller's Valley News is 30 minutes long 7 o'clock Central but then coming up we're gonna probably go
[02:24:43.310 --> 02:24:44.971]  6 p.m.
[02:24:44.971 --> 02:24:49.473]  until midnight or so with the election on Tuesday.
[02:24:49.473 --> 02:24:51.614]  Dr. Joseph Mercola is our guest.
[02:24:51.614 --> 02:24:53.676]  Mercola.com.
[02:24:53.676 --> 02:25:08.903]  And I wanted to get him on, just because from my lay research, purified water, sunshine, having enough vitamin D, getting enough sleep, and staying away from people, you know, if it starts spreading and having Ebola is the answer.
[02:25:08.903 --> 02:25:10.604]  But the media and the government's not saying that.
[02:25:10.604 --> 02:25:11.805]  They're saying, we got a vaccine.
[02:25:13.228 --> 02:25:23.752]  And so, if you have a bunch of people that aren't prepared, and it was to start spreading in these winter months when it spreads worse, then you could end up with a real problem in this country.
[02:25:23.752 --> 02:25:26.433]  And we had already cut you off going to break.
[02:25:26.433 --> 02:25:30.575]  They told me you were agreeing with my statement about Codex Almentarius and the RDAs in Europe.
[02:25:31.331 --> 02:25:34.092]  Yeah, I thought you were referring to the decrease in the U.S.
[02:25:34.092 --> 02:25:38.033]  I wasn't aware of that, but I certainly would agree it's probably going on in Europe.
[02:25:38.033 --> 02:25:38.933]  Oh yeah, Europe, Europe.
[02:25:38.933 --> 02:25:39.293]  Sure, sure.
[02:25:39.293 --> 02:25:45.354]  I mean, your point is, it's been done in Europe, we know what they want, now they're pushing it here.
[02:25:45.354 --> 02:25:51.916]  I don't think the average American knows that they almost banned supplements outright back in the mid-1990s.
[02:25:51.916 --> 02:25:52.896]  They came very close.
[02:25:52.896 --> 02:25:56.197]  If it wasn't for Ron Paul and activists and others, we would be up the creek.
[02:25:57.237 --> 02:25:59.378]  They started the Shay Act, too.
[02:25:59.378 --> 02:25:59.978]  Yes.
[02:25:59.978 --> 02:26:01.258]  It was a big, important part.
[02:26:01.258 --> 02:26:06.380]  Now we've got the Senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin, who's really the most aggressive promoter.
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:14.082]  But fortunately, most of the other congressmen don't buy it, and he hasn't been able to pass most of his legislation.
[02:26:14.793 --> 02:26:24.982]  Dr. Mercola, are we reaching a tipping point where the congressmen, senators, and congresswomen, and the governors, they're using supplements themselves?
[02:26:24.982 --> 02:26:29.146]  It's like McDonald's profits are down 33%, other fast foods way down.
[02:26:29.146 --> 02:26:34.911]  Are we starting to reach that tipping point where even if they don't have mandatory labeling, the market's just going to do it?
[02:26:36.354 --> 02:26:48.663]  I think we're getting there, getting closer and closer, especially as the economy deteriorates and there's a demand for more accountability and further resources and to make sure that you're getting what you pay for, which we certainly don't in this country.
[02:26:48.663 --> 02:26:51.666]  We're spending $3 trillion a year and we've got miserable results.
[02:26:51.666 --> 02:26:56.109]  We're ranked 49th in the world for longevity.
[02:26:56.109 --> 02:26:57.951]  It's just not a good return on our investment.
[02:26:57.951 --> 02:27:03.235]  So when the economy collapses, I believe it will at some point, it's inevitable, then we're going to...
[02:27:04.036 --> 02:27:11.488]  Be facing some hard choices and they're going to be looking for solutions that work and these solutions that we promote work very clearly.
[02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:19.316]  That's right, that's why alternative health and wellness is becoming, not the alternative, but becoming dominant in many sectors.
[02:27:19.316 --> 02:27:22.960]  The empire will strike back, but where the people go, they can't stop us.
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:27.925]  You know, you're not just a successful doctor, you're a successful businessman running your huge operation.
[02:27:27.925 --> 02:27:32.109]  I want to get your take on collapse being inevitable, because I agree with that statement.
[02:27:32.109 --> 02:27:33.591]  What type of collapse, Dr. Mercola?
[02:27:35.157 --> 02:27:41.480]  I don't know what will manifest, but you can't be printing trillions of dollars every year and expect not to have some consequence of that.
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:47.684]  Now, admittedly, almost all the central banks in the world are doing it too, but at some point it's got to give up.
[02:27:47.684 --> 02:27:58.830]  I mean, they may keep it up for another 3, 5, 10 years, but at some point it's going to collapse and there'll be severe scenario, probably much more severe than the depression in the 30s in the U.S.
[02:27:58.830 --> 02:28:02.652]  I think that's going to look like a piece of cake compared to what's coming.
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:07.582]  I agree, and I don't say that because it's sensational for audiences.
[02:28:07.582 --> 02:28:10.544]  That's what every smart person I talk to says.
[02:28:10.544 --> 02:28:12.545]  It's what billionaires I know say.
[02:28:12.545 --> 02:28:18.928]  It's what the governments are digging in for, while they try to get the public to be completely unaware of what's going on.
[02:28:18.928 --> 02:28:24.051]  I would think to stabilize things, they'd want to get the public ready and aware.
[02:28:24.051 --> 02:28:27.233]  Well, that would be counter to their purposes.
[02:28:27.233 --> 02:28:29.314]  For a large part, this is planned.
[02:28:29.314 --> 02:28:30.514]  Oh yes.
[02:28:30.514 --> 02:28:32.215]  They're very clever and sophisticated.
[02:28:34.628 --> 02:28:39.132]  Lots of resources to achieve their goals and this is part of the process.
[02:28:39.132 --> 02:28:39.953]  Absolutely.
[02:28:39.953 --> 02:28:44.297]  I think it's better to focus on what we can do and I noticed you mentioned earlier that you'd lost 50 pounds.
[02:28:44.297 --> 02:28:45.958]  I want to congratulate you on that.
[02:28:45.958 --> 02:28:47.600]  That's phenomenal.
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:55.466]  But you know, there's actually a connection between your weight loss and the ability to improve your immune system and that has to do with insulin resistance.
[02:28:55.466 --> 02:28:57.088]  And I'm writing a book next year.
[02:28:57.088 --> 02:28:58.969]  It'll be out in February called Effortless Healing.
[02:28:58.969 --> 02:29:01.712]  It should be the number one book published next year for health.
[02:29:02.361 --> 02:29:07.145]  We've got a lot of resources going behind it to promote it.
[02:29:07.145 --> 02:29:11.548]  One of the central course that we teach is this whole issue with insulin resistance.
[02:29:11.548 --> 02:29:19.995]  Would you like to know what the simplest and most effective way I've ever seen in 30 years of treating tens of thousands of patients to reverse insulin resistance?
[02:29:19.995 --> 02:29:21.056]  I want to know when we come back.
[02:29:21.656 --> 02:29:23.218]  And I can't wait to have you on when that book comes out.
[02:29:23.218 --> 02:29:24.400]  I want to carry it.
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:26.002]  Dr. Joseph Mercola is our guest.
[02:29:26.002 --> 02:29:30.668]  And then I want to give him the floor when we come back for a while to talk about what he thinks is most important.
[02:29:30.668 --> 02:29:32.711]  Because I can throw out questions all day.
[02:29:32.711 --> 02:29:39.140]  Speaking of those questions, we're going to go to your questions, just throw out your election point, and then let's get your health point.
[02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:40.782]  Uh, when we come back.
[02:29:40.782 --> 02:29:44.506]  Froggo, Jennifer, Nick, Jordy, and others.
[02:29:44.506 --> 02:29:46.869]  We're gonna come back after this break with Dr. Mercola.
[02:29:46.869 --> 02:29:48.030]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:48.030 --> 02:29:49.131]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:49.131 --> 02:29:50.052]  I forgot to tell you about it.
[02:29:50.052 --> 02:29:53.817]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.817 --> 02:29:56.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.942 --> 02:30:03.565]  InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:30:13.434 --> 02:30:19.400]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not
[02:30:19.540 --> 02:30:19.940]  I don't think so.
[02:30:38.078 --> 02:30:40.679]  Fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[02:30:40.679 --> 02:30:51.502]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[02:31:00.823 --> 02:31:02.764]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:31:02.764 --> 02:31:07.286]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:31:07.286 --> 02:31:11.749]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:31:11.749 --> 02:31:19.072]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:31:19.072 --> 02:31:28.137]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:28.357 --> 02:31:33.900]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:41.485]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[02:32:00.598 --> 02:32:11.164]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:32:11.164 --> 02:32:17.607]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:32:17.607 --> 02:32:19.949]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:32:19.949 --> 02:32:23.050]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:32:23.050 --> 02:32:29.914]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:32:30.467 --> 02:32:34.130]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:38.394]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:38.394 --> 02:32:40.175]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:40.175 --> 02:32:48.042]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:48.042 --> 02:32:49.183]  But for how long?
[02:32:49.183 --> 02:32:55.828]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:32:55.828 --> 02:32:58.651]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:33:05.496 --> 02:33:07.878]  Something strange and it looks socialist.
[02:33:07.878 --> 02:33:10.860]  And it's trying to sell GMO food.
[02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:11.701]  And take your guns.
[02:33:11.701 --> 02:33:12.681]  Big Brother.
[02:33:12.681 --> 02:33:14.563]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:14.563 --> 02:33:16.184]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:16.184 --> 02:33:17.685]  You want answers?
[02:33:17.685 --> 02:33:19.266]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:19.266 --> 02:33:26.712]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.712 --> 02:33:27.613]  Tyranny Busters.
[02:33:27.613 --> 02:33:31.475]  Something strange and it don't look good.
[02:33:31.475 --> 02:33:33.017]  We are back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:34.059 --> 02:33:36.140]  Dr. Joseph Mercola is our guest.
[02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:38.002]  We've had more than 20 contests.
[02:33:38.002 --> 02:33:41.944]  One contest was for $100,000 and was hugely successful.
[02:33:41.944 --> 02:33:45.687]  This one, because our budget's a little tighter, is $7,500.
[02:33:45.687 --> 02:33:49.770]  $5,000 first place, $1,000 second place, $500 third place.
[02:33:49.770 --> 02:33:52.251]  I always buy it off more than I can chew.
[02:33:52.251 --> 02:33:56.474]  Every time we've had a contest, I announce the date that I'm going to be announcing the winner.
[02:33:56.474 --> 02:33:58.316]  I always push it back a week.
[02:33:58.316 --> 02:34:01.898]  One time we had something like 600 good entries.
[02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:11.858]  And I had the pleasure of getting to watch them all, and then we wanted to promote them, tweet them, put them on Facebook, put them on Infowars.com.
[02:34:11.858 --> 02:34:15.822]  We got over a hundred good ones this time, only with a two-week notice.
[02:34:15.822 --> 02:34:17.604]  Other contests have gone for two, three months before.
[02:34:17.604 --> 02:34:18.525]  That's when we get 600, 700 entries.
[02:34:18.525 --> 02:34:19.106]  500, 600 of them being really good.
[02:34:23.613 --> 02:34:30.498]  This is the Ebola, tying Obama's non-response to Ebola to the tyranny of socialism and collectivism.
[02:34:30.498 --> 02:34:33.941]  Hashtag tyranny is the disease, help expose it.
[02:34:33.941 --> 02:34:36.443]  Today was the day I was supposed to announce the winners.
[02:34:36.443 --> 02:34:40.706]  We've still got more contest entries to post this weekend and next week.
[02:34:40.706 --> 02:34:43.108]  I still have not seen all the entries.
[02:34:43.108 --> 02:34:45.710]  I've seen about 60 or 70 of them.
[02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:48.252]  I've got to go watch 30 or 40 more I haven't looked at.
[02:34:49.707 --> 02:34:51.688]  I've got to go back and look at the top 10 again.
[02:34:51.688 --> 02:34:58.753]  So I'm going to spend a couple hours this weekend, a couple hours next week, trying to judge the winner.
[02:34:58.753 --> 02:35:01.355]  I get feedback from the crew that's been watching them.
[02:35:01.355 --> 02:35:04.537]  But all of you are winners because you're exposing the tyranny.
[02:35:04.537 --> 02:35:06.378]  You're out there being political activists.
[02:35:06.378 --> 02:35:07.459]  That's what it's all about.
[02:35:07.459 --> 02:35:18.286]  Look, one movie, Supersize Me, helped trigger a revolution that was already under the surface to revolutionize and really turn the tide against the poison, the additives,
[02:35:19.987 --> 02:35:24.110]  Plasticizers, the GMOs, the chemicals in the food.
[02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:30.053]  And we still aren't winning, but we're coming from behind and are set to start winning.
[02:35:30.053 --> 02:35:35.716]  People expose aspartame as bad, they just change the name and put it in almost every gum and candy out there, including sugared.
[02:35:35.716 --> 02:35:38.178]  I tell people, you know, your sugar gum has aspartame.
[02:35:38.178 --> 02:35:40.959]  No it doesn't, it's sugar gum.
[02:35:40.959 --> 02:35:43.701]  Friends, family, you name it, go, wow, you're right.
[02:35:43.701 --> 02:35:44.842]  That stuff makes you go blind.
[02:35:46.124 --> 02:35:49.849]  Pro-toothpaste hashtag hijacked by anti-fluoride activists.
[02:35:49.849 --> 02:35:50.750]  We launched this.
[02:35:50.750 --> 02:35:59.762]  InfoWars put out a call to hijack hashtag sweet Halloween to inform parents about the dangers of fluoridated toothpaste.
[02:35:59.762 --> 02:36:02.385]  This was put out by Crest Corporation.
[02:36:03.467 --> 02:36:05.348]  Or I guess Procter & Gamble or whoever owns Crest.
[02:36:05.348 --> 02:36:06.449]  I think it's Procter & Gamble.
[02:36:06.449 --> 02:36:07.910]  I'm going from memory.
[02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:13.974]  And we're just exposing the Harvard studies, the hundreds of other... It's actually thousands, but I say hundreds because it sounds unbelievable.
[02:36:13.974 --> 02:36:17.176]  Nothing's been studied like fluoride and lead and mercury and things like that.
[02:36:17.176 --> 02:36:18.937]  I mean, just been studied for hundreds of years.
[02:36:18.937 --> 02:36:21.098]  They know what fluoride does.
[02:36:21.098 --> 02:36:22.139]  And so we've hijacked it.
[02:36:22.139 --> 02:36:23.640]  It's been taken over.
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:26.382]  One of the contest entries on Obama got picked up.
[02:36:27.142 --> 02:36:32.763]  By newspapers around the country, and one of them that picked it up was Egan News.
[02:36:32.763 --> 02:36:39.304]  Man in Obama mask and hazmat suit hangs Ebola, Ebola posters across Chicago.
[02:36:39.304 --> 02:36:44.965]  And here it is in the major newspaper, DrugsReport.com picked up the video and now it's gone viral.
[02:36:44.965 --> 02:36:48.526]  See, that's how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:48.526 --> 02:36:50.186]  So everybody's a winner.
[02:36:50.186 --> 02:36:52.347]  I don't know who's going to be the three winners.
[02:36:52.347 --> 02:36:53.727]  We'll let you know very soon.
[02:36:53.727 --> 02:36:54.507]  And please don't forget,
[02:36:56.047 --> 02:37:00.909]  If you need cutting-edge vitamins, minerals, supplements, there's a lot of great places out there.
[02:37:00.909 --> 02:37:06.012]  Mercola.com, great products and just sensible, real reviews.
[02:37:06.012 --> 02:37:09.914]  We try to be at that very same high standard and just go with the facts.
[02:37:09.914 --> 02:37:19.679]  Infowarslife.com, the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, the Super Mel Vitality, the Oxy Powder from Global Healing Center that just, well, you've heard the right reviews.
[02:37:19.679 --> 02:37:24.321]  We can't keep it on the shelves and it's about to sell out because it's word of mouth.
[02:37:25.081 --> 02:37:28.923]  I only want to bring out supplement products that blow people away.
[02:37:28.923 --> 02:37:41.469]  Now, I want to get into fluoride briefly with Dr. Mercola and then some phone calls, but I want to give him the floor to talk about whatever's front and center, but you were getting into diabetes, going epidemic, up in some statistics in Hispanics up 3,000%.
[02:37:41.469 --> 02:37:44.411]  They're saying that they're set to have
[02:37:45.333 --> 02:37:47.094]  60-70% of Hispanics by 2025.
[02:37:47.094 --> 02:37:52.418]  They're talking about half the public perhaps having type 2 diabetes.
[02:37:52.418 --> 02:37:56.580]  Suddenly type 1, that's supposedly genetic, is popping up in people later in life.
[02:37:56.580 --> 02:37:59.082]  You're a big expert on this, Dr. Mercola.
[02:37:59.082 --> 02:38:00.303]  You were getting into it.
[02:38:00.303 --> 02:38:03.065]  They never ask, why is diabetes up?
[02:38:03.065 --> 02:38:04.866]  They always say, what's the cure?
[02:38:04.866 --> 02:38:08.088]  Well, wouldn't the cure be not doing what's causing it to go epidemic?
[02:38:08.088 --> 02:38:10.910]  So, A, what's making it go epidemic?
[02:38:11.747 --> 02:38:13.128]  Or pandemic, I think is the word.
[02:38:13.128 --> 02:38:14.408]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:38:14.408 --> 02:38:16.429]  And then B, what are the secrets to it?
[02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:19.090]  I mean, how can people stop from getting it?
[02:38:19.090 --> 02:38:21.891]  And what's been shown to be promising?
[02:38:21.891 --> 02:38:23.772]  Well, Alex, it's not just diabetes.
[02:38:23.772 --> 02:38:27.513]  It's obesity, it's cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's.
[02:38:27.513 --> 02:38:32.695]  These all have at their central core insulin resistance.
[02:38:32.695 --> 02:38:36.857]  So the most effective way I've ever found clinically to address it
[02:38:37.890 --> 02:38:39.731]  is the timing of your food.
[02:38:39.731 --> 02:38:46.254]  The quality and the type of food you eat is important too, but the timing is massively important.
[02:38:46.254 --> 02:38:48.115]  Let's start with breakfast.
[02:38:48.115 --> 02:38:52.216]  We all know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, right?
[02:38:52.216 --> 02:38:52.817]  Wrong!
[02:38:52.817 --> 02:38:53.357]  It's a myth.
[02:38:53.357 --> 02:38:54.117]  Who created it?
[02:38:54.117 --> 02:38:55.678]  The cereal companies.
[02:38:55.678 --> 02:38:59.119]  More important than any single meal is how many hours you eat in any single day.
[02:38:59.119 --> 02:39:04.982]  Because not only do we eat the wrong food, but for many of us, the only time we don't eat is when we sleep.
[02:39:06.434 --> 02:39:06.634]  Thank you.
[02:39:21.613 --> 02:39:23.555]  They're basically feast for famine.
[02:39:23.555 --> 02:39:25.357]  I saw some of those studies interrupt you.
[02:39:25.357 --> 02:39:35.908]  That's why they think Meso-Americans who are really land-bridge Asians that came over are getting hit so hard because they really survived on almost nothing and were super tough and hardy.
[02:39:35.908 --> 02:39:41.614]  But you give somebody with those genetics a ton of food, I mean, boy, they're going to be dead in a hammer really quick.
[02:39:42.574 --> 02:39:44.015]  Yeah, so that is the key.
[02:39:44.015 --> 02:39:52.219]  See, we're basically, most of us are feasting 24-7, and we just don't go into the fast mode.
[02:39:52.219 --> 02:39:58.341]  And the fast mode doesn't have to be for long periods of time, but if we do it regularly, there's a number of ways to accomplish this.
[02:39:58.341 --> 02:40:04.644]  And the most effective way that I've found is, and you only need to do this as long as the insulin resistance persists.
[02:40:04.644 --> 02:40:05.685]  And how do you know?
[02:40:05.685 --> 02:40:09.847]  You either take a fasting blood insulin level, your weight normalizes,
[02:40:10.647 --> 02:40:13.929]  You don't have diabetes, or you're not taking a statin drug.
[02:40:13.929 --> 02:40:21.995]  So if those things disappear, you don't have to do this, but until those things disappear, do the 3-8-3.
[02:40:21.995 --> 02:40:31.602]  Stop eating at least 3 hours before you go to bed, sleep 8 hours, and start eating at least 3 hours later than you do now.
[02:40:32.742 --> 02:40:36.825]  And then when that happens, magic occurs.
[02:40:36.825 --> 02:40:39.266]  You'll be less hungry, you'll lose your cravings.
[02:40:39.266 --> 02:40:40.107]  That's now happened.
[02:40:40.107 --> 02:40:42.368]  It's just the most amazing thing.
[02:40:42.368 --> 02:40:44.270]  It's just absolutely incredible.
[02:40:44.270 --> 02:40:44.610]  It's incredible.
[02:40:44.610 --> 02:40:51.855]  I did a juice cleanse about four months ago and that and pure iodine and eating healthier, all of a sudden,
[02:40:53.328 --> 02:40:58.491]  I'm not even doing what I was doing before, and the wait is just coming off exponentially.
[02:40:58.491 --> 02:41:00.752]  Yeah, it's just massively important.
[02:41:00.752 --> 02:41:01.552]  So just the timing.
[02:41:01.552 --> 02:41:07.755]  If you restrict your eating window to six to eight hours a day until the insulin disappears, it's amazing.
[02:41:07.755 --> 02:41:13.758]  You know, you mentioned to our viewers that we actually have 10 million unique visitors to our site a month, and one of our visitors
[02:41:15.279 --> 02:41:22.824]  She had mentioned that she had tried this for about a month and she used a six-hour eating window and the first day her cravings disappeared.
[02:41:22.824 --> 02:41:29.048]  What she couldn't believe and what was most impressive is that she only had that similar result previously using amphetamines.
[02:41:29.048 --> 02:41:33.592]  That's how profoundly effective the appetite suppressant effect is.
[02:41:33.592 --> 02:41:35.153]  You're not buying anything.
[02:41:35.153 --> 02:41:44.139]  You're just using the time you're eating to basically jumpstart your ability to start burning fat.
[02:41:44.909 --> 02:41:47.931]  Well, that's the old Hollywood secret that I've been told by so many people there.
[02:41:47.931 --> 02:41:48.992]  Models, you name it.
[02:41:48.992 --> 02:41:49.672]  Famous actors.
[02:41:49.672 --> 02:41:51.653]  They've all told me.
[02:41:51.653 --> 02:41:53.975]  Alex, the key, because back then I was fat.
[02:41:53.975 --> 02:41:57.137]  I mean, not super fat, but overweight.
[02:41:57.137 --> 02:41:58.698]  They say, man, you'll lose that weight.
[02:41:58.698 --> 02:42:02.341]  Don't ever eat after the sun goes down.
[02:42:02.341 --> 02:42:06.163]  And that's just well known by models.
[02:42:06.163 --> 02:42:06.804]  You name it.
[02:42:06.804 --> 02:42:08.725]  Never eat after the sun goes down.
[02:42:08.725 --> 02:42:08.845]  Yeah.
[02:42:10.049 --> 02:42:11.170]  That's a good strategy.
[02:42:11.170 --> 02:42:19.657]  So, and if you do that and you get your insulin resistance under control, then you don't have to worry about infections because you'll improve your insulin resistance, but you'll also improve your gut microbiome.
[02:42:19.657 --> 02:42:29.144]  And interestingly, you know, you talked about the artificial sweeteners like aspartame, which I think we're making major progress on, but there's scientists that figured out, they published a study last month in Nature.
[02:42:29.144 --> 02:42:34.268]  We figured out how one of the major mechanisms, how aspartame actually causes you to gain weight.
[02:42:34.488 --> 02:42:41.025]  Well I remember you being on my show like 15 years ago and a medical doctor as well, Dr. Blaylock saying...
[02:42:41.874 --> 02:42:45.675]  We have evidence that aspartame, stuff in Diet Coke, makes you fat.
[02:42:45.675 --> 02:42:49.616]  Now suddenly, CBS News headline, diet sodas make you fat.
[02:42:49.616 --> 02:42:51.077]  Go ahead, tell us about that.
[02:42:51.077 --> 02:43:00.440]  Well, the mechanism, the reason how it makes you fat, we didn't know until like a few months ago, is that it alters your microbiome, your gut microbiome, for the worse.
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:04.041]  You get the wrong bacteria growing there, which causes you to gain weight.
[02:43:04.041 --> 02:43:07.462]  So it's all about improving your gut flora and decreasing the insulin resistance.
[02:43:07.462 --> 02:43:10.483]  You get those one-two punches and there's almost no diseases you can't
[02:43:10.503 --> 02:43:10.863]  I think so.
[02:43:37.233 --> 02:43:42.920]  You know, staying away from sugar, of artificial sweeteners, chlorinated water, getting enough sleep.
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:44.983]  You know, it's mundane, but it really does work.
[02:43:44.983 --> 02:43:45.563]  It's very powerful.
[02:43:45.563 --> 02:43:49.949]  And getting the insulin resistance resolved by something like intermittent fasting.
[02:43:49.949 --> 02:43:53.113]  So they basically found the way to shut off the fat gene.
[02:43:55.387 --> 02:43:57.068]  Well, it's not the fat gene.
[02:43:57.068 --> 02:44:12.360]  What happens is when we eat all these excess carbohydrates and we're eating regularly, we're not fasting, then that builds up enzymes that basically suppress our body's ability to produce something like lipase, which helps burn our fat.
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:18.605]  No, no, I understand that, but I'm saying it's in the genetics that we're not designed to do this, so you turn off
[02:44:19.466 --> 02:44:23.688]  The fat gene, even though it's not really a fat gene, by getting in line with your genes.
[02:44:23.688 --> 02:44:24.128]  Right, yeah.
[02:44:24.128 --> 02:44:29.851]  Well let me ask you this then, what would you call, what would you call this then, this huge scientific discovery?
[02:44:31.533 --> 02:44:34.556]  Well, the general term is called intermittent fasting in the literature.
[02:44:34.556 --> 02:44:39.199]  I call it effortless eating because it truly is effortless, Alex.
[02:44:39.199 --> 02:44:41.721]  I've never seen anything so magical.
[02:44:41.721 --> 02:44:46.325]  Once you get that insulin resistance resolved, the hunger cravings disappear.
[02:44:46.325 --> 02:44:48.227]  The only time you're hungry is when you need to eat.
[02:44:48.227 --> 02:44:50.048]  You don't have these cravings for sugar or junk food.
[02:44:50.048 --> 02:44:50.529]  They disappear.
[02:44:51.149 --> 02:44:55.874]  Because when you're eating too much, you get unbalanced, and now you just keep eat, eat, eating.
[02:44:55.874 --> 02:45:08.726]  Well, no, because your body requires, because you can't burn fat, you have to burn sugar, so you only have about 12 hours of sugar, so as you start to get low on your sugar, you have to replete that, to replete your glycogen stores.
[02:45:08.726 --> 02:45:11.489]  So scientists discovered the secret of fat loss and health.
[02:45:12.952 --> 02:45:21.676]  Yeah, well, it's not one specific scientist, but there's an emerging consensus among a large number of professionals that this is the most effective way to achieve that.
[02:45:21.676 --> 02:45:23.636]  Well, sure, that's in the literature.
[02:45:23.636 --> 02:45:31.900]  It's just amazing that everything that the big corporations do is the opposite of this, and it shows they've known this all along.
[02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:36.261]  Going back to Edward Bernays and the rest of it, I mean, they've been engineering us to be unhealthy.
[02:45:36.261 --> 02:45:37.142]  Why do you think that is?
[02:45:37.862 --> 02:45:44.827]  Well, you know, I'm familiar with Bernay and I would agree with your position and what he's doing, but I don't know that they really understand this.
[02:45:44.827 --> 02:45:53.433]  I mean, just like most of these health care professionals, they're buying in the whole client-seeker themselves, not only personally, but for their own family.
[02:45:53.433 --> 02:45:57.015]  They just want a shell no matter what, and even if it kills their own kids.
[02:45:57.876 --> 02:45:59.797]  Well, it's because they believe, they truly believe it.
[02:45:59.797 --> 02:46:04.359]  I think that they aren't, it's not a conspiracy that they've got these guys aligned with them.
[02:46:04.359 --> 02:46:17.825]  They've convinced them so cleverly and with such sophisticated tools and techniques like Bernay and you know these, they have some of the most sophisticated marketing tools available ever known to humankind.
[02:46:17.825 --> 02:46:20.466]  So they're using them and they can afford them.
[02:46:20.466 --> 02:46:23.167]  So they use them liberally to
[02:46:24.548 --> 02:46:27.130]  Hi Alex, no last time I checked I'm not a hobbit.
[02:46:27.130 --> 02:46:27.511]  Right then.
[02:46:52.228 --> 02:46:59.271]  Uh, here in England, um, council elections are regarded as a weather vane for general elections.
[02:46:59.271 --> 02:47:11.855]  Um, topology experts spend hours, much of it in television studios, analysing what the 20% turnout did and making projections for the real thing.
[02:47:11.855 --> 02:47:18.497]  I think the principle is perfectly transferable to everywhere that has this election game.
[02:47:18.497 --> 02:47:20.678]  So, this election that's coming up,
[02:47:22.175 --> 02:47:29.540]  Can be taken as a weathervane of the presidential election in, like, two years.
[02:47:29.540 --> 02:47:38.626]  My expectation is a general victory for the Republic Creeps.
[02:47:38.626 --> 02:47:46.811]  And I figure that the New World Order has already decided that the next president should be a Republicanoid.
[02:47:46.811 --> 02:47:49.433]  Because the democratic brand is worn out.
[02:47:50.825 --> 02:47:53.306]  Which was inevitable.
[02:47:53.306 --> 02:48:13.131]  Long, long ago, um, there was George Walker Bush, the President, and, uh, let's see, he won the election by, I think it was five votes to four, which caused a lot of consternation, um, all over the planet, not just locally.
[02:48:13.131 --> 02:48:15.312]  And then over, well, let's see,
[02:48:16.334 --> 02:48:22.097]  Over the next eight years, he proceeded to be the piece of scum that anyone who had looked at him would say.
[02:48:22.097 --> 02:48:24.559]  Sure, and then the Savior Obama comes in, and a new Savior.
[02:48:24.559 --> 02:48:28.401]  But now the Tea Party is being targeted by the Republicans and Democrats.
[02:48:28.401 --> 02:48:31.242]  I want to get Dr. Mercola's take on that, but I want yours.
[02:48:31.242 --> 02:48:38.066]  Showing, just like UKIP or something, they are genuinely... You sound like Nigel Farage, by the way, caller.
[02:48:38.066 --> 02:48:39.827]  So, so, so you do.
[02:48:39.827 --> 02:48:41.488]  So, he's been on the show many times.
[02:48:41.488 --> 02:48:44.990]  I don't drink as much.
[02:48:45.595 --> 02:48:46.296]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:46.296 --> 02:48:47.537]  Well, go ahead and finish your point.
[02:48:47.537 --> 02:48:53.385]  It's just that, can we see a revolution through both parties to reform each party, or what's going to happen?
[02:48:53.385 --> 02:48:57.950]  I want to get your brief take on that caller from England, Frogo, and I want to get our doctor friend's take on it.
[02:48:57.950 --> 02:48:59.292]  Frogo, but who's counting?
[02:48:59.292 --> 02:49:01.355]  Well, basically my position is kick the bombs out.
[02:49:03.239 --> 02:49:11.225]  Vote for Tea Party candidates wherever possible, and where it's not possible, just don't take part in the game, because it is a game.
[02:49:11.225 --> 02:49:12.085]  Or run yourself.
[02:49:12.085 --> 02:49:13.526]  Let me get Dr. Mercola's take on that.
[02:49:13.526 --> 02:49:14.627]  Or run yourself, yes.
[02:49:14.627 --> 02:49:15.227]  Sure.
[02:49:15.227 --> 02:49:15.868]  Dr. Mercola.
[02:49:17.020 --> 02:49:26.052]  Again, I don't lionize the Republicans or the Democrats, but the Democrats have really been on mock speed right now, using the fact that they could pacify the left to power grab.
[02:49:26.052 --> 02:49:27.954]  What do you make of these elections?
[02:49:27.954 --> 02:49:30.457]  And they're saying it could be a political realignment.
[02:49:30.457 --> 02:49:34.543]  They're saying it could be the biggest landslide ever is what polls are showing against Democrats.
[02:49:35.984 --> 02:49:39.326]  Yeah, I really don't focus on that too much because there's so many other areas.
[02:49:39.326 --> 02:49:50.471]  The only concentration I do is how it affects the health components, which would be, we've got GMO labeling bills in Oregon and Colorado this year, and there's a strong probability it will be effective.
[02:49:50.471 --> 02:50:00.856]  They did pass in Virginia earlier this year, so we have one state that's already passed the labeling bill, and of course they're being sued by Monsanto and others.
[02:50:01.616 --> 02:50:08.038]  So, you know, I think the direct ballot initiative is a really powerful tool that we're utilizing out West.
[02:50:08.038 --> 02:50:08.938]  You can't do it, really.
[02:50:08.938 --> 02:50:10.598]  Yeah, bring us up to speed on that.
[02:50:10.598 --> 02:50:21.241]  Talk about the state of that because of the fact that Monsanto and others would spend tens of millions of dollars per state in some cases so that we don't know that their BT corn is in it.
[02:50:21.241 --> 02:50:26.563]  I mean, how outrageous is that that a car company wouldn't want their label on the car?
[02:50:27.543 --> 02:50:31.444]  I mean, that tells you right there, that is such fraud in my view.
[02:50:31.444 --> 02:50:36.905]  That is such fraud in my view that they would lobby so that I couldn't know their stuff is in the food.
[02:50:36.905 --> 02:50:45.167]  I was the primary donor for the California initiative two years ago, and then we've been heavily supporting the Washington and Oregon ones also.
[02:50:45.167 --> 02:50:51.689]  But the central issue is that we've lost California and Washington.
[02:50:52.589 --> 02:50:55.311]  There's a good possibility that we'll win in Oregon.
[02:50:55.311 --> 02:50:59.054]  But even though we've lost that battle, we're winning the war.
[02:50:59.054 --> 02:51:08.301]  Because you may not be aware of it, but there's a clear demand when you go to the store for non-GMO products.
[02:51:08.301 --> 02:51:10.803]  Even at Walmart and Target?
[02:51:10.803 --> 02:51:13.065]  It exceeds the demand for organic.
[02:51:13.065 --> 02:51:19.950]  Within literally two years, we changed the consciousness of the public to understand that non-GMO is more important than organic.
[02:51:20.370 --> 02:51:27.773]  In fact, when I was thinking about trying to get you on a few weeks ago, that's why I wanted you on, was about Ebola, to get your take on it, but also to talk about...
[02:51:29.179 --> 02:51:34.681]  Words cannot describe how massive your work and all the millions of activists work and our work, everybody.
[02:51:34.681 --> 02:51:36.001]  This is a big win here.
[02:51:36.001 --> 02:51:42.183]  That I go to Target or even a Walmart now and it's non-GMO organic Heinz ketchup.
[02:51:42.183 --> 02:51:47.444]  Everything is converting to it even though a lot of times it isn't pure organic and there's some cheating going on.
[02:51:47.444 --> 02:51:49.705]  The fact is we're winning the hearts and minds.
[02:51:49.705 --> 02:51:52.226]  McDonald's is imploding.
[02:51:52.226 --> 02:51:56.107]  That's why I've said I think we're making the sea change in the fact that I think
[02:51:56.887 --> 02:51:58.869]  I mean, did you guys get like a million bucks?
[02:51:58.869 --> 02:52:01.492]  It happened because of what we did in California.
[02:52:01.492 --> 02:52:02.693]  Everyone was so sad that we lost.
[02:52:02.693 --> 02:52:10.380]  We narrowly lost just because, you know, they've thrown in $100 million to basically buy political ads and lie.
[02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:12.022]  You know, it's legal to lie in these things.
[02:52:12.022 --> 02:52:14.544]  They outright lie and they're not arrested for it.
[02:52:15.365 --> 02:52:16.826]  So that's how they win.
[02:52:16.826 --> 02:52:18.747]  They just flood the media.
[02:52:18.747 --> 02:52:21.989]  But if it wasn't for California, you wouldn't see those changes.
[02:52:21.989 --> 02:52:25.170]  That was only two years, Alex, so I think there's great hope.
[02:52:25.170 --> 02:52:36.196]  You know, we're utilizing the direct ballot initiative, which exists within many states, I think somewhere between 30 and 40 states, and we're utilizing that and making massive victories.
[02:52:36.196 --> 02:52:42.719]  And we cannot overstate how big this is and how central you were to that.
[02:52:42.719 --> 02:52:44.120]  How much did you end up giving to it?
[02:52:45.233 --> 02:52:46.460]  Was it a California initiative?
[02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:46.581]  Yes.
[02:52:48.535 --> 02:52:51.436]  Uh, basically somewhere between one and two million.
[02:52:51.436 --> 02:52:53.656]  I think it's probably closer to two.
[02:52:53.656 --> 02:52:57.417]  And then, wasn't that like most of the money to counter the hundred million?
[02:52:57.417 --> 02:52:57.857]  No, no.
[02:52:57.857 --> 02:53:02.338]  Collectively, the hundred million was what they've donated for all the campaigns together.
[02:53:02.338 --> 02:53:10.560]  In California, I think we raised ten million totally for the pro-labeling campaign.
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:15.602]  Because California's a massive state, so of course there's more funding required.
[02:53:15.602 --> 02:53:17.122]  The opposition raised fifty million.
[02:53:17.842 --> 02:53:19.563]  So yeah, they have spent us five to one.
[02:53:19.563 --> 02:53:20.604]  That's right.
[02:53:20.604 --> 02:53:27.568]  But the good news is, and I'll say it, I saw the polls, I think there was fraud in both states.
[02:53:27.568 --> 02:53:30.130]  But I know you don't want to go there, but let's just say this.
[02:53:30.130 --> 02:53:32.512]  You lost the battle, but you're winning the war.
[02:53:32.512 --> 02:53:34.053]  We lost the battle, we're winning the war.
[02:53:34.053 --> 02:53:39.056]  Because it raised the consciousness and the awareness that I'm not allowed to know there's GMO?
[02:53:39.056 --> 02:53:39.696]  Well, you know what?
[02:53:39.696 --> 02:53:42.959]  Then I'm going to buy from the companies that openly want to tell me.
[02:53:42.959 --> 02:53:46.441]  Because if you're not telling me that you don't have it, then I know you've got it.
[02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:50.162]  Yeah, that's basically the key.
[02:53:50.162 --> 02:53:52.304]  So we make these small victories.
[02:53:52.304 --> 02:53:54.906]  It is a war, so there's going to be battles.
[02:53:54.906 --> 02:53:58.889]  We've got another battle coming up, and it's great if we win because it accelerates the process.
[02:53:58.889 --> 02:54:04.153]  We don't have to delay it as long, but it's still raising consciousness of the public because the media picks up on it.
[02:54:04.153 --> 02:54:08.356]  We put in $10 million, we probably got $100-$500 million worth of media exposure.
[02:54:08.356 --> 02:54:09.236]  More than that.
[02:54:09.236 --> 02:54:11.638]  And again, you spearheaded that, Dr. Mercola.
[02:54:11.638 --> 02:54:12.639]  I do want to give you the credit.
[02:54:12.639 --> 02:54:13.520]  It was a good investment.
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:15.141]  It was a tremendous return on investment.
[02:54:15.521 --> 02:54:18.482]  Much better than the three trillion we're spending on healthcare, I can tell you that.
[02:54:18.482 --> 02:54:20.143]  That's right, but it's got to feel good.
[02:54:20.143 --> 02:54:38.892]  You're another example of what one man can do than reaching out to others, building your organization, doing all these interviews, writing all your articles, doing, you know, it's so amazing to know that we can win if we just believe we can and start taking action, but it's not going to happen overnight.
[02:54:39.761 --> 02:54:42.583]  No, and the action has to be concerted and very strategic.
[02:54:42.583 --> 02:54:46.006]  I mean, we're playing against very clever and sophisticated forces.
[02:54:46.006 --> 02:54:55.974]  I mean, they know what they're doing, so you just can't go in there willy-nilly and, you know, you need concerted efforts and you need to align with like-minded individuals, but you have to have a strategy at the higher levels.
[02:54:55.974 --> 02:54:56.835]  You just can't.
[02:54:56.835 --> 02:55:02.239]  And that's where a lot of mistakes are made, because people have good intent, but they don't have a powerful strategy.
[02:55:02.239 --> 02:55:08.705]  Fortunately, you know, we've identified some really effective strategists to help us in the campaign.
[02:55:09.247 --> 02:55:09.567]  I agree.
[02:55:09.567 --> 02:55:11.769]  We're going to let you go here in a few minutes.
[02:55:11.769 --> 02:55:19.354]  We're going to go into overdrive and talk to Nick in California listening on KOMY, 1340, Jennifer, Jordy and a few others.
[02:55:19.354 --> 02:55:29.721]  But Dr. Mercola, in the few minutes we've got left here, I do see not just an economic collapse coming, but a total collapse in confidence in the political system.
[02:55:29.721 --> 02:55:32.603]  Gallup shows a 7% approval rating for Congress.
[02:55:32.603 --> 02:55:36.226]  They can have cult of personalities like Obama, but when they don't deliver
[02:55:37.256 --> 02:55:45.545]  They go from icon to scoundrel pretty much overnight, and I see that compacting, accelerating.
[02:55:45.545 --> 02:55:49.550]  I don't think the establishment's going to be able to continue on the way they are.
[02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:51.772]  What do you see in the future?
[02:55:51.772 --> 02:55:54.935]  Well, I see an inevitable collapse, and to me there's no other
[02:55:57.032 --> 02:55:58.293]  Optionally, really.
[02:55:58.293 --> 02:56:02.136]  But there's no way, to me it's impossible to predict that.
[02:56:02.136 --> 02:56:07.379]  I mean, it might not be for 50 years, it might be two generations later, it might be 100 years, or it could be next year.
[02:56:07.379 --> 02:56:08.920]  I have no idea.
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:12.302]  But I just know that the trajectory on is not healthy.
[02:56:12.302 --> 02:56:15.184]  And there's just no, they're not going to give up their power.
[02:56:15.184 --> 02:56:16.725]  They just aren't until there's a collapse.
[02:56:16.725 --> 02:56:18.627]  There's just no way.
[02:56:18.627 --> 02:56:21.729]  But we can accelerate that process and it's going to be good.
[02:56:21.729 --> 02:56:24.371]  It's just like an alcoholic who goes through
[02:56:25.484 --> 02:56:29.968]  He has to hit the gutter before he recovers, and that's what's going to be required here.
[02:56:29.968 --> 02:56:36.635]  We have to suffer some severe pain before everyone's willing to make the necessary changes to help the whole process recover.
[02:56:41.508 --> 02:56:55.719]  It's true, BT GMO corn is making pigs have bleeding intestines and there's been a double fold plus increase of kids being brought into emergency rooms with irritable bowel and leaky gut and they've directly linked it to the BT.
[02:56:55.719 --> 02:56:58.281]  Well no kidding, it kills the bugs that eat it.
[02:56:58.281 --> 02:57:00.163]  What do you think it's going to do when it hits us?
[02:57:00.163 --> 02:57:04.386]  And what does Bill Gates and Monsanto and all these people think they're going to do
[02:57:05.527 --> 02:57:12.177]  Once more and more of this comes out, and not just them, all the other GMO companies and people, I just don't know how they think they're going to get away with this.
[02:57:13.393 --> 02:57:16.354]  Well, you know, I would not underestimate their resources.
[02:57:16.354 --> 02:57:21.374]  I mean, they've got incredible wealth and sophisticated strategies to counter things.
[02:57:21.374 --> 02:57:23.855]  So they're going to do just fine.
[02:57:23.855 --> 02:57:30.516]  So we just have to look at ourselves, basically take control of our own health, not rely on these drugs and medicines, surgeries, just to do simple things.
[02:57:30.516 --> 02:57:36.057]  Avoid sugar, use intermittent fasting, get plenty of sunshine, safe tanning.
[02:57:36.057 --> 02:57:38.237]  You know, these are strategies that we can each and every day.
[02:57:38.237 --> 02:57:42.338]  So we change ourselves and pull ourselves out of the system one step at a time.
[02:57:43.018 --> 02:57:45.000]  Yes, and lead by example.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:54.347]  Show your friends and relatives that you don't have to accept the hook, line, and sinker with what the media is telling them, and that there are healthy options that are really inexpensive.
[02:57:55.851 --> 02:57:58.612]  Well, I tell you, thank God for you, Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[02:57:58.612 --> 02:57:59.512]  Mercola.com.
[02:57:59.512 --> 02:58:03.593]  Have a great weekend, a safe All Hallows' Eve, and we appreciate you.
[02:58:03.593 --> 02:58:04.613]  All right, well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:58:04.613 --> 02:58:05.993]  Appreciate you and all you're doing, too.
[02:58:05.993 --> 02:58:06.393]  Thank you.
[02:58:06.393 --> 02:58:08.834]  Amazing individual right there, and I tell you, he doesn't brag.
[02:58:08.834 --> 02:58:14.635]  He has done so much with his team and his supporters, and we know our listeners are his supporters and viewers.
[02:58:14.635 --> 02:58:15.756]  He does a lot of media as well.
[02:58:15.756 --> 02:58:16.876]  Check it out, Mercola.com.
[02:58:17.256 --> 02:58:19.397]  Check us out, Infowars.com.
[02:58:19.397 --> 02:58:20.999]  Drudge Report leaked our article.
[02:58:20.999 --> 02:58:22.319]  I never got to it.
[02:58:22.319 --> 02:58:23.780]  It's on the right-hand side of Drudge.
[02:58:23.780 --> 02:58:26.002]  It's red-linked on Infowars.com.
[02:58:26.002 --> 02:58:30.905]  CDC to purchase body bags in anticipation of more Ebola deaths.
[02:58:30.905 --> 02:58:33.527]  And they just sent a quarter million body bags to Dallas.
[02:58:33.527 --> 02:58:37.790]  Federal agency issues services sought notice for PPE supplies.
[02:58:37.790 --> 02:58:40.171]  We'll be back in just a minute in Overdrive, Infowars.com.
[02:58:47.377 --> 02:58:48.365]  GCMI.com today.
[02:58:50.891 --> 02:58:52.152]  Another major health threat.
[02:58:52.152 --> 02:58:57.114]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:58:57.114 --> 02:58:59.795]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:58:59.795 --> 02:59:06.838]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:59:06.838 --> 02:59:09.839]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:59:09.839 --> 02:59:12.780]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:59:12.780 --> 02:59:14.801]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:59:14.801 --> 02:59:17.642]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:59:17.722 --> 02:59:23.444]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:59:23.444 --> 02:59:26.966]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:59:26.966 --> 02:59:30.047]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:59:30.047 --> 02:59:37.370]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:59:37.370 --> 02:59:40.591]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:59:47.495 --> 02:59:48.697]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.127 --> 03:00:14.649]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:14.649 --> 03:00:22.215]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:22.215 --> 03:00:29.922]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:29.922 --> 03:00:32.605]  By the way, I didn't get to this breaking news when Mercola was on.
[03:00:32.605 --> 03:00:34.586]  It's up on DrugsReport.com.
[03:00:34.586 --> 03:00:35.667]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[03:00:39.042 --> 03:00:41.724]  People make fun of NASA with blowing up rockets.
[03:00:41.724 --> 03:00:44.725]  One blew up earlier this week, $500 million.
[03:00:44.725 --> 03:00:48.467]  Resupplying the International Space Station.
[03:00:48.467 --> 03:00:57.072]  Well, that's because the operator deliberately destroyed the rocket because they thought that it was unstable.
[03:00:57.072 --> 03:00:57.573]  Well, now...
[03:00:58.607 --> 03:01:04.896]  It's being reported by the LA Times Virgin Galactic Spaceship 2 crashes during testing.
[03:01:04.896 --> 03:01:09.202]  Yeah, we'll see how that does now with your space plane when you try to get people on board those.
[03:01:12.182 --> 03:01:15.824]  I mean, they can't even hardly get these things into space.
[03:01:15.824 --> 03:01:17.005]  Let me just tell you something right now.
[03:01:17.005 --> 03:01:23.949]  They're being given designs that are 30 years old as kind of a joke by the British aerospace and U.S.
[03:01:23.949 --> 03:01:25.170]  aerospace.
[03:01:25.170 --> 03:01:28.552]  I happen to know from classified sources about those space planes.
[03:01:28.552 --> 03:01:31.014]  That model is a marine troop carrier, basically.
[03:01:33.186 --> 03:01:36.247]  I shouldn't even get into this stuff.
[03:01:36.247 --> 03:01:39.107]  That's a Marine Corps, British Marine style.
[03:01:39.107 --> 03:01:39.527]  The U.S.
[03:01:39.527 --> 03:01:40.207]  has one.
[03:01:40.207 --> 03:01:42.688]  They declassified part of it about 10 years ago.
[03:01:42.688 --> 03:01:45.148]  I think it was like in Popular Mechanics or something.
[03:01:45.148 --> 03:01:50.949]  But they don't deploy them because they tend to, every fifth or sixth mission, blow up.
[03:01:50.949 --> 03:01:53.309]  From the intel I've got.
[03:01:53.309 --> 03:01:55.290]  So, I mean, this is just not easy.
[03:01:55.290 --> 03:01:57.370]  This is not safe.
[03:01:57.370 --> 03:02:02.071]  It's a smaller model than what the Marines were trying to develop.
[03:02:04.403 --> 03:02:05.263]  It's a space plane.
[03:02:05.263 --> 03:02:07.264]  They've been trying to put them in orbit for 50 years.
[03:02:07.264 --> 03:02:09.104]  They got a bunch of them.
[03:02:09.104 --> 03:02:11.865]  They've gone with unmanned because they don't tend to blow up as easy.
[03:02:11.865 --> 03:02:14.786]  But there you go.
[03:02:14.786 --> 03:02:18.907]  Let's go ahead and let's talk to Jennifer in Illinois.
[03:02:18.907 --> 03:02:20.787]  Jennifer, you're on the air.
[03:02:20.787 --> 03:02:22.448]  Hi, Alex.
[03:02:22.448 --> 03:02:23.128]  Welcome.
[03:02:23.128 --> 03:02:30.010]  I am just calling to complain about the Illinois governor election.
[03:02:32.668 --> 03:02:40.674]  Basically, I don't know if you went over the way the GOP tried to keep the Libertarians off the ballot.
[03:02:40.674 --> 03:02:41.194]  It's horrible.
[03:02:41.194 --> 03:02:43.376]  The GOP is disgusting.
[03:02:43.376 --> 03:02:45.398]  Yeah, they're very disgusting.
[03:02:45.398 --> 03:02:48.560]  And for the past two weeks, I've gotten these mail
[03:02:50.390 --> 03:02:52.771]  These mail ads from the GOP.
[03:02:52.771 --> 03:02:55.411]  I haven't gotten any from the Democrats, which is surprising.
[03:02:55.411 --> 03:03:00.472]  Well, see, this has gone on so long where the GOP has blocked Libertarians.
[03:03:00.472 --> 03:03:02.032]  We're just taking them over.
[03:03:02.032 --> 03:03:04.513]  So where, as I say, go for Libertarian candidates.
[03:03:04.513 --> 03:03:12.395]  If there's a Republican that's good, though, vote for them over a Libertarian, because we want to take over the House and Senate.
[03:03:12.395 --> 03:03:18.456]  But the Republicans have done horrible things, not just to other Libertarians, but to people like Ron Paul and others.
[03:03:19.016 --> 03:03:22.718]  So the Republican leadership is basically the same as the Democrats?
[03:03:22.718 --> 03:03:24.058]  Right, and it is.
[03:03:24.058 --> 03:03:31.561]  And you've got Rayner and you've got Quinn, who basically, there's not hardly any difference between those two at all.
[03:03:31.561 --> 03:03:41.446]  But my complaint is, the ads that I have gotten from the GOP, not one ad are they attacking the Democrats at all.
[03:03:41.446 --> 03:03:43.426]  They are attacking Chad Grimm.
[03:03:45.191 --> 03:04:00.793]  Calling him a Democrat agent, you know, since he was allowed on the ballot, which, just a few minutes of looking up, I could find out that the judge that allowed the Libertarians on the ballot in Illinois was a Republican.
[03:04:01.405 --> 03:04:14.175]  So, you know, basically that, that, uh, you know, them saying that the Democrats, you know, just allowed him on the ballot to take away votes from, from Rayner, that, that theory's just, you know, brushed across.
[03:04:14.175 --> 03:04:14.635]  No, I hear you.
[03:04:14.635 --> 03:04:15.976]  Do a YouTube video about it.
[03:04:15.976 --> 03:04:16.576]  Speak up.
[03:04:16.576 --> 03:04:17.998]  You are the media.
[03:04:17.998 --> 03:04:19.058]  I gotta jump, we're out of time.
[03:04:19.058 --> 03:04:21.760]  I apologize to Nick and Jordy.
[03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:24.542]  Call back again and I'll, I'll get you in there.
[03:04:24.542 --> 03:04:26.544]  But, um, I hear you, ma'am.
[03:04:26.544 --> 03:04:28.706]  Politics is a very, very dirty situation.
[03:04:29.406 --> 03:04:33.951]  And that's why we all need to get involved ourselves, run for office, support people that we know.
[03:04:33.951 --> 03:04:36.353]  Not that it's a perfect system, it's terrible.
[03:04:36.353 --> 03:04:42.459]  Getting good people to get into the process will give us more eyes on the ground to report on the corruption and the problems.
[03:04:42.459 --> 03:04:44.141]  Alright, great job to the crew.
[03:04:44.141 --> 03:04:46.804]  Thank you listeners, thank you sponsors, thank you good lord above.
[03:04:46.804 --> 03:04:48.265]  Everybody have a safe good weekend.
[03:04:48.265 --> 03:04:48.605]  Pray for...
[03:04:49.770 --> 03:04:52.733]  All the kids out there, they're gonna be grabbed by satanists today and killed.
[03:04:52.733 --> 03:04:53.614]  We know that goes on.
[03:04:53.614 --> 03:04:55.115]  The media tries to cover it up.
[03:04:55.115 --> 03:04:59.439]  And don't forget the CDC now purchasing body bags for Ebola in full wars.com.
