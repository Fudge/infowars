[00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.390]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.171]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:09.931]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:11.512]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:13.052]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:17.253]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:21.334]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:34.197]  Well, Barack Obama is spending his Valentine's Day away from Michelle O. I'm sure with a pile of cocaine, a carton of cigarettes.
[00:00:34.197 --> 00:00:37.840]  Hillary, I'm sure is going to be spending it with her girlfriends.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.521]  And hey, that's what Valentine's Day is for, huh?
[00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:42.117]  Alright, let's get serious.
[00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:48.741]  CBS News says there's record cold weather all over the Northern Hemisphere because of global warming.
[00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:52.783]  Winter storm has killed at least 12 people across the South.
[00:00:52.783 --> 00:00:55.945]  A storm wipes out power for thousands.
[00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:58.487]  CBS again blames global warming for bad weather.
[00:00:58.487 --> 00:01:01.729]  Of course, the Arctic was supposed to be melted this year.
[00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:02.209]  Remember that?
[00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:03.830]  Al Gore said that back in 2007 and 2009.
[00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.490]  Keep laughing, he said.
[00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:09.948]  It's going to be melted, completely melted.
[00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:13.611]  Of course, it's a record thickness, the last 50 years.
[00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:17.334]  So, cancelled airlines, scrapped record number of flights, that's just something we're going to be covering.
[00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:24.300]  But don't worry, the TSA is not showing up to keep you safe from imaginary threats staged by criminal elements of the government.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.066]  Snowstorm keeps TSA agents home, causes security line chaos at Newark Airport.
[00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.908]  So, that is all in the news.
[00:01:33.908 --> 00:01:34.388]  Meanwhile,
[00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.709]  I'm sure they'll blame this on global warming, too.
[00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:46.031]  Mass evacuation of 20,000 in Indonesia as Jamba volcano erupts.
[00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:59.474]  And I've actually seen the fake environmentalists, like it's voodoo or something, claim that we're having volcanic activity because of global warming, which is supposedly from carbon dioxide, and they say Mother Earth is mad at us.
[00:02:00.444 --> 00:02:07.729]  I think if there's a Mother Earth that's mad about the GMO and the nuclear power plants leaking all over the place, not about carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:08.889]  I mean, I'm just sorry.
[00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.571]  They want to tax part of the carbon cycle, that's why they picked that.
[00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:28.522]  Mark Moreno, who heads up Climate Depot, the foremost group clearinghouse exposing the fraud that is man-made global warming and why we should be concerned about it, how it's a societal takeover excuse, he's going to be joining us coming up in the
[00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:36.874]  Second hour for 30 minutes, and then we saw a music video a few weeks ago.
[00:02:36.874 --> 00:02:38.856]  We said, man, that looks like our show or something.
[00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:42.240]  That must be a really tuned in, smart folks.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.482]  Of course, I like Korn, listen to Korn, listen to
[00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.291]  Metallica, Megadeth, you name it.
[00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:49.733]  I mean, I like good, hard music.
[00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:52.554]  And I know they've had some messages of liberty in the past.
[00:02:52.554 --> 00:02:54.675]  So we sent them an email and said, hey, are you listeners of the show?
[00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:55.356]  Would you like to come on?
[00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:56.597]  And sure enough, they are.
[00:02:56.597 --> 00:02:58.578]  So they're going to talk about their music video.
[00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.199]  Jonathan Davis, lead singer of Korn.
[00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.943]  I was going to come on for about 25-30 minutes at the start of the third hour today.
[00:03:04.943 --> 00:03:11.569]  Always good to reach out to more folks out there in the entertainment industry who are putting out great music videos, really exposing the whole system.
[00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.270]  And believe me, they try to keep them on a short leash.
[00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.373]  It takes Billy Corgan a lot of courage to come on this show.
[00:03:16.373 --> 00:03:19.075]  It takes Dave Mustaine a lot of courage to come on this show.
[00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:20.957]  People like Jimmy Vaughn have come on over the years.
[00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:26.882]  You know, the media paints him up as a bad boy.
[00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:29.401]  That's all you need to do is call him.
[00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:30.682]  He keeps saying for years he'll come on.
[00:03:30.682 --> 00:03:35.923]  Everybody demonized him so much, but he's really a nice guy overall and has matured quite a bit in my view.
[00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:37.803]  He's kind of the Americana story.
[00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:43.645]  I need to get Jesse James in here someday as well because he's not scared to talk about guns and liberty and freedom.
[00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:48.066]  There's so many people who know what's going on who will not come on the show.
[00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:50.767]  Like Bruce Willis.
[00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:52.848]  And again, I'm not calling out Bruce Willis.
[00:03:52.848 --> 00:04:03.171]  It's not his job to come out and say his view on the New World Order, though he told Vanity Fair that he's woken up to the New World Order and that the left and right are controlled and that the same people that killed Kennedy are running the country today.
[00:04:03.171 --> 00:04:04.411]  It's just that it's frustrating.
[00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:09.293]  Imagine if Bruce Willis, he's a smart guy, has a lot of political pull.
[00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:10.713]  He's never really been political.
[00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:11.993]  People listen to him.
[00:04:11.993 --> 00:04:12.814]  Good looking guy.
[00:04:12.814 --> 00:04:15.674]  Imagine if he came out.
[00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:17.315]  People like Rick Linklater have come out on the show.
[00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:20.196]  Many, many others.
[00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:25.518]  I guess Mike Judge has come on the show and criticized the corrupt system and kind of the mafia of the Democrats.
[00:04:25.518 --> 00:04:28.198]  And he said, I was never a Democrat or a Republican.
[00:04:28.198 --> 00:04:30.059]  I'm liberal on some issues, conservative on others.
[00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:40.081]  But he said the bullying of the Democrats and the IRF stuff and the way they act, I mean, it's just... And Michael Moore with his bodyguards and then saying, I can't own a gun.
[00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:42.042]  He said it really turned him against them.
[00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:43.382]  And I think that's what's going on here.
[00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:44.643]  But that's a side issue.
[00:04:44.643 --> 00:04:45.903]  I just always admire the courage.
[00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:52.116]  You know, even if it's the lead singer of Ministry coming on the show who's a listener.
[00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:54.278]  And the point is, is that they've got courage.
[00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:55.939]  Because believe me, the system comes after you.
[00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.361]  But what happens when everybody starts going public?
[00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:00.203]  Aha!
[00:05:00.203 --> 00:05:04.927]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:05:04.927 --> 00:05:08.050]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.595]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:15.176]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:17.157]  We are what we eat.
[00:05:17.157 --> 00:05:21.819]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.041]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:28.602]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:34.825]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:02.928]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:06.171]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots
[00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:08.052]  Over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:06:08.052 --> 00:06:16.155]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:06:16.155 --> 00:06:20.697]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:06:20.697 --> 00:06:24.659]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:30.361]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:33.763]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:06:33.763 --> 00:06:39.146]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[00:06:39.146 --> 00:06:47.331]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:47.651]  That's 866-229-0927.

[00:06:50.553 --> 00:06:51.473]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex.
[00:07:00.038 --> 00:07:03.359]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:05.780]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:14.383]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:24.587]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:38.738]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:38.738 --> 00:07:45.082]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:53.709]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[00:08:18.047 --> 00:08:23.811]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:29.034]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:29.034 --> 00:08:32.536]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:32.536 --> 00:08:33.276]  That's right!
[00:08:33.276 --> 00:08:35.538]  We are waging war on corruption!
[00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:43.053]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:43.714]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:45.755]  Central.
[00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:49.598]  We're live, my friends, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:08:49.598 --> 00:08:52.180]  Then we return Sundays, and I'll be hosting this Sunday.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.541]  It was David Knight last Sunday, did a great job.
[00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:55.922]  I'll be hosting 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:55.922 --> 00:09:04.048]  Central with the Sunday transmission.
[00:09:04.048 --> 00:09:08.191]  I want to wish all of you a great Valentine's Day today.
[00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.771]  They're gonna break the chains!
[00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:22.993]  You can't stop them!
[00:09:22.993 --> 00:09:24.234]  Balls to the walls, folks.
[00:09:24.234 --> 00:09:27.915]  You know what that means?
[00:09:27.915 --> 00:09:35.237]  It means, in an airplane, in the old days, like in a B-17, when they'd ram the throttle all the way forward, all the way to the wall.
[00:09:35.237 --> 00:09:37.358]  This particular song's about knocking down the Berlin Wall.
[00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.671]  Take the balls to the walls.
[00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:42.852]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, again, it is Friday.
[00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:44.553]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:09:44.553 --> 00:09:45.614]  I was not here yesterday.
[00:09:45.614 --> 00:09:51.757]  You know, I thought as I went out and shot a bunch of guns up close and might have breathed in some of the gunpowder, that's why I had a sore throat.
[00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:55.198]  Turns out I had a fever the last few days and finally decided to check it and did have about 101.
[00:09:55.198 --> 00:09:59.581]  And so I didn't come into work yesterday.
[00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:05.544]  In the old days, I would come in with a fever, but I just did not want to sound like a toad on air.
[00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:06.544]  But I'm here today.
[00:10:06.544 --> 00:10:07.805]  My fever broke last night.
[00:10:09.028 --> 00:10:22.512]  And I did a little bit of light exercise this morning and so I am here today trying not to have a giant coughing fit because I feel like I have fire ants in my lungs right now.
[00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:23.192]  But I am here.
[00:10:23.192 --> 00:10:26.273]  I'm very thankful that you have tuned in.
[00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:32.656]  For this Friday, Valentine's Day, February 14th, 2014.
[00:10:32.656 --> 00:10:34.077]  Goodness gracious.
[00:10:34.077 --> 00:10:37.159]  Saints alive, it is hard to keep saying 2014.
[00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:42.182]  Even though we're already halfway in, it's a short month, 28 days, February.
[00:10:42.182 --> 00:10:49.747]  We are already halfway in, ladies and gentlemen, to the second month of 2014.
[00:10:49.747 --> 00:10:53.169]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:54.670]  We do have the lead singer of Korn.
[00:10:55.796 --> 00:11:08.006]  We've got Jonathan Davies, who is a critic of the New World Order, the One World Government, and our Lord and Savior, as Jamie Foxx calls him, Barack Obama.
[00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:12.910]  So he's going to commit massive heresy and sacrilege speaking out against the dear leader
[00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.631]  That doesn't mean he doesn't support the Republicans, it just means he doesn't support Obama.
[00:11:16.631 --> 00:11:21.033]  It's kind of like, go to a used car dealership and they have two cars for sale and you decide you don't want either one.
[00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:24.915]  We're going to be talking about that with him for about 30 minutes at the start of the third hour.
[00:11:24.915 --> 00:11:33.798]  And then Mark Moreno will be joining us to talk about the record cold and the record northern and southern ice caps.
[00:11:33.798 --> 00:11:36.159]  And what's happening with the sun.
[00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:39.361]  And the fact that CBS News and others are saying all of this is happening.
[00:11:40.481 --> 00:11:42.603]  All of this is unfolding.
[00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:45.364]  All of this is going on because of global warming.
[00:11:45.364 --> 00:11:58.494]  If you just pay Al Gore and Obama and literally the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and George Soros money to the Chicago and New York and London climate exchanges, everything would be okay.
[00:11:58.494 --> 00:12:02.296]  And here's the Hill newspaper right now.
[00:12:02.296 --> 00:12:08.621]  Headline, Obama to pitch $1 million climate change resilience fund in California.
[00:12:09.568 --> 00:12:15.091]  The fund would be needed to be approved by Congress and intended to help communities deal with negative weather.
[00:12:15.091 --> 00:12:16.911]  That's the result of climate change.
[00:12:16.911 --> 00:12:22.754]  They're going to pay people when you have normal, you know, weather fluctuations, drought, floods, you name it.
[00:12:22.754 --> 00:12:24.715]  The only thing that's normal is that you do have fluctuations.
[00:12:24.715 --> 00:12:26.556]  The only thing normal is climate change.
[00:12:26.556 --> 00:12:28.937]  Well, they'll pay you to sign on and agree to it.
[00:12:29.577 --> 00:12:32.659]  Like an indulgence, or I guess like faith-based initiatives.
[00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:38.683]  President Obama will pitch the new billion-dollar climate resilience fund during a visit Friday to California.
[00:12:38.683 --> 00:12:47.828]  Obama is touting the fund during a trip to California, which has been devastated by drought that is threatening the Central Valley's agricultural production.
[00:12:47.828 --> 00:12:53.772]  Why'd you shut down all the northern lake locks, claiming it's for some sucker fish that's not even indigenous?
[00:12:57.096 --> 00:13:01.238]  Five years ago, they shut the water off in Klamath and other areas and a bunch of other lakes.
[00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:04.779]  They're just brimming with water right now.
[00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:08.601]  Don't worry, the feds are here to save you.
[00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:12.482]  All collectivist systems work so well.
[00:13:12.482 --> 00:13:15.663]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[00:13:15.663 --> 00:13:16.804]  But again, it's record cold.
[00:13:16.804 --> 00:13:18.544]  Just look at drugreport.com.
[00:13:18.544 --> 00:13:21.766]  FAA grounds flower delivery drone.
[00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.711]  Uh, keeping us safe from that.
[00:13:24.711 --> 00:13:29.352]  Just a gimmick drone that flies a few thousand yards.
[00:13:29.352 --> 00:13:30.373]  Mid-Atlantic storm.
[00:13:30.373 --> 00:13:32.594]  Ninth biggest ever recorded.
[00:13:32.594 --> 00:13:33.934]  Snow in 49 states.
[00:13:33.934 --> 00:13:36.635]  Great Lakes ice breakers exhausted.
[00:13:36.635 --> 00:13:38.916]  Thousands without power.
[00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:40.677]  Residents cook food in fireplaces.
[00:13:40.677 --> 00:13:42.957]  We're gonna ban those under Gen 21.
[00:13:42.957 --> 00:13:45.659]  100 car pileups on PA Turnpike.
[00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:48.119]  Philly snowfall shatters.
[00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.700]  130 year old record.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.881]  Pregnant woman killed by snow plow in Brooklyn.
[00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:54.568]  Body found covered in snow in D.C.'
[00:13:54.508 --> 00:13:54.848]  's tree.
[00:13:54.848 --> 00:13:56.109]  Yeah, a bunch of deaths.
[00:13:56.109 --> 00:13:59.552]  Blizzard 2, Lash, Easter, New England, Saturday.
[00:13:59.552 --> 00:14:00.853]  And then you got Obama's slush fund.
[00:14:00.853 --> 00:14:01.933]  But don't worry.
[00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:02.894]  Nightmare.
[00:14:02.894 --> 00:14:06.456]  Flights canceled nationwide in different states from coast to coast.
[00:14:06.456 --> 00:14:11.360]  And the TSA, you know, doctors and nurses will walk six, seven miles to get to their patients.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.622]  But the TSA, they won't even take a taxi.
[00:14:14.622 --> 00:14:17.504]  No, they're just going to stay home.
[00:14:17.504 --> 00:14:18.645]  They are just going to stay home.
[00:14:20.905 --> 00:14:28.010]  And a major magazine is asking, is the snapping turtle, the National Journal asks, is the snapping turtle too old to run?
[00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.691]  No, I don't think Hillary Clinton's too old to run.
[00:14:29.691 --> 00:14:31.392]  I think she's too evil to run.
[00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:32.652]  Too openly corrupt to run.
[00:14:32.652 --> 00:14:36.375]  And I can't believe, Kurt Nimmo wrote an article last night for Infowars.com.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.661]  Maybe you guys will print me that out of the archive.
[00:14:39.661 --> 00:14:40.302]  I was gone yesterday.
[00:14:40.302 --> 00:14:44.324]  There was a lot of big stories I saw and which almost ended up calling into the show.
[00:14:44.324 --> 00:14:48.587]  You print me everything in the archive, the news archive, you know, the top story archive.
[00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:50.489]  All the interesting stories, thanks.
[00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:51.709]  I just want to go over some of those today.
[00:14:51.709 --> 00:14:54.752]  I just remember there's a bunch of them I want to get to.
[00:14:54.752 --> 00:14:55.992]  But no, no, no.
[00:14:55.992 --> 00:14:59.715]  She's too evil to be president.
[00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:03.938]  But I understand under the gimmick of a woman, you'd want a Sarah Palin.
[00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:16.808]  Or you'd want, you know, some 40, 50-year-old woman to run because, you know, the gimmick was that Obama was young and well-spoken and I guess some people said good-looking.
[00:15:16.808 --> 00:15:18.949]  I think he looks like a space alien, quite frankly.
[00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:21.531]  I don't think he's good-looking.
[00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:24.113]  And that'd mean for a black guy, a white guy, anybody.
[00:15:24.113 --> 00:15:28.456]  I mean, Jakari Jackson's a good-looking guy whether you call him black or white.
[00:15:28.456 --> 00:15:30.698]  You know, somebody around the office like Weldon Henson's a good-looking guy.
[00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:31.799]  It doesn't matter if he's black or white.
[00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:35.059]  I mean, Hillary Clinton is ugly.
[00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.159]  Period.
[00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:37.959]  Ugly inside, ugly outside.
[00:15:37.959 --> 00:15:39.720]  Look at the photo on Drudge.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.940]  I mean, that's why I call her a snapping turtle, man.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:47.782]  She looks like an old, mean, diseased, infested snapping turtle.
[00:15:47.782 --> 00:15:57.445]  And right next to her, Michelle Obama looks like a narcissistic crocodile, slash vampire, slash snapping turtle, slash man.
[00:15:57.445 --> 00:16:01.966]  And if you want to start a conspiracy theory, it's well reported that Obama
[00:16:02.947 --> 00:16:07.769]  You know, is pitching and batting for, he's working for both teams, basically.
[00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:10.309]  And, you know, I'm not judging him, you know, there.
[00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:17.712]  My whole issue is, is that, you know, maybe the secret word is, is that Michelle Obama is really a man.
[00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:20.613]  Anybody, I'm sure they're all going to pick that up in magazines.
[00:16:20.613 --> 00:16:27.315]  It's a joke, and if all the Democratic Party operations can't take a joke, good, that's the whole point.
[00:16:27.315 --> 00:16:30.076]  You have no power, you can do nothing to me, attack me.
[00:16:31.707 --> 00:16:34.211]  I'm sure you'll take the bait.
[00:16:34.211 --> 00:16:41.682]  I'm talking about your Lord and Savior, Hillary, saying she looks like an ugly snapping turtle, and you're the one saying come out of the closet about everything.
[00:16:43.208 --> 00:16:53.774]  So Hillary and Michelle Obama both have arranged marriages for basically kids that are used as beards for Obama and the Clintons and the rest of them.
[00:16:53.774 --> 00:16:55.815]  And I don't even mean a gay beard.
[00:16:55.815 --> 00:17:01.819]  You know, like somebody has a wife or a husband so they can go out in their profession and look manly or look feminine.
[00:17:01.819 --> 00:17:08.443]  I'm saying a beard for the fact that you use your kids politically like Obama has dogs as a beard.
[00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.394]  And I was not a fan of George W. Bush, everybody knew this, but their dogs are not beards.
[00:17:14.394 --> 00:17:17.636]  They're kissing them, they're carrying them on and off the airplane.
[00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:19.798]  I know spoiled dogs when I see them.
[00:17:19.798 --> 00:17:22.821]  You look at Obama's dogs, no one even knows where they're at or what's going on.
[00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:29.166]  Remember the day after Clinton was out of office, his dog died mysteriously at like age six?
[00:17:29.166 --> 00:17:32.128]  It's like, you know, get rid of the prop.
[00:17:32.128 --> 00:17:35.271]  They're totally fake, they're totally plastic is my point.
[00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:39.354]  And it's all a facade up there.
[00:17:41.084 --> 00:17:48.290]  I think it's discriminatory, though, in Homeland Security and in government that women who are heterosexual can't get jobs.
[00:17:48.290 --> 00:18:00.700]  I mean, I really think it's weird that the heads of Homeland Security and the heads of the Justice Department and, you know, the news anchors, everybody else, why is it if you're not gay, you can't get a job?
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.481]  Basically, in the modern power structure.
[00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:04.102]  I mean, I'm just laying the truths out here.
[00:18:04.102 --> 00:18:06.484]  They're so obsessed with it and want to push it out there.
[00:18:06.484 --> 00:18:07.425]  I'm sick of it.
[00:18:07.425 --> 00:18:08.346]  I'll just bring it all out.
[00:18:09.315 --> 00:18:12.217]  And I personally have heard just about enough of all of it.
[00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.299]  And it makes me disgusting.
[00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:18.923]  Makes me absolutely want to throw up how fake these people.
[00:18:18.923 --> 00:18:22.486]  Nancy Pelosi's come out on Valentine's Day and said, why would anybody want to get married?
[00:18:22.486 --> 00:18:24.888]  Yeah, just have a couple kids.
[00:18:24.888 --> 00:18:27.130]  And we'll get that video for later.
[00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.474]  Have a couple kids and then just give them over to the state.
[00:18:31.474 --> 00:18:33.916]  What a witch-like woman.
[00:18:33.916 --> 00:18:36.438]  Nancy, another snapping turtle Pelosi,
[00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:43.000]  She's courting the singles demographics this Valentine's Day.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.201]  Yeah, pitching that it's not popular to have kids.
[00:18:45.201 --> 00:18:47.962]  Let me tell you something, women and men.
[00:18:47.962 --> 00:18:50.503]  Women don't want to have kids till they're 35.
[00:18:50.503 --> 00:18:53.324]  And they want to do one thing after that, and that's have kids.
[00:18:53.324 --> 00:18:57.585]  And by the time they're 40 and haven't had kids, they go crazy and they gotta have kids.
[00:18:57.585 --> 00:19:04.667]  So keep thinking you're on the winning team because you're running around never having kids.
[00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:07.428]  Women, you only get sexier after you've had kids.
[00:19:08.567 --> 00:19:08.687]  He's
[00:19:31.889 --> 00:19:33.529]  Coming back strong.
[00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:36.010]  All the big news on the other side.
[00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.490]  Huge Obamacare news.
[00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.231]  Huge debt limit news.
[00:19:41.231 --> 00:19:47.672]  Huge, huge, huge Obama dictator garbage news.
[00:19:47.672 --> 00:19:50.293]  And just stacks of NSA news.
[00:19:50.293 --> 00:19:53.154]  Second Amendment news.
[00:19:53.154 --> 00:19:57.455]  Oh, and by the way, the government's now laid the groundwork publicly to take your 401k and IRA.
[00:19:57.455 --> 00:19:59.215]  Told you that was coming light years back.
[00:20:00.498 --> 00:20:02.119]  My husband's the gun guy.
[00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:03.960]  I've just never felt comfortable with them.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.562]  But these days, I know I need protection.

[00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:02.479]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:07.623]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:23:07.623 --> 00:23:15.750]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.275]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:24.098]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:24.218 --> 00:23:30.183]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:30.183 --> 00:23:33.345]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:38.730]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:24:01.525 --> 00:24:02.346]  In constant sorrow,
[00:24:23.368 --> 00:24:44.553]  I just want to get this out there right now, that I really want to tell everybody out there who loves liberty and loves justice and loves freedom, that I love you.
[00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:54.230]  So I'm gonna give everybody out there a big mwah from Alex Jones and the rest of the crew saying, will you be my Valentine in Liberty?
[00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:59.033]  And as sappy as that is, that's why I said it, because we need to just get stuff off our chest.
[00:24:59.033 --> 00:25:03.855]  I really do love our listeners and I appreciate you every day putting up with me.
[00:25:03.855 --> 00:25:09.898]  That's what I say to folks when they come over with stars in their eyes, shaking my hand on the side of the street, these families and people.
[00:25:09.898 --> 00:25:12.979]  I just say thanks for putting up with me.
[00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:14.080]  Wow, where to start?
[00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:15.867]  Where to begin?
[00:25:15.867 --> 00:25:21.550]  I mentioned this article, government lays groundwork to confiscate your 401k and IRA.
[00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.091]  Quote, this is happening.
[00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:27.474]  That's in a Reuters article that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:25:27.474 --> 00:25:29.675]  Pretty big deal.
[00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:33.577]  Pretty big deal to have quotes like that right out of Reuters.
[00:25:33.577 --> 00:25:34.838]  And we've just got so much more.
[00:25:34.838 --> 00:25:36.779]  I've got to get to all this.
[00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:42.562]  But first off, I thought I'd just play you more ridiculous lies from Obama, the king of lies.
[00:25:42.562 --> 00:25:44.003]  Really, he makes Bill Clinton look truthful.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:52.803]  It almost could call Obama the father of lies, but we know he's only the son of lies.
[00:25:52.803 --> 00:25:58.006]  Think about Pelosi coming out and saying, I don't get married, just like attacking everything.
[00:25:58.006 --> 00:26:07.570]  And I was out, I was in the coffee room during the break, getting some coffee, and Biden was on C-SPAN.
[00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.912]  He was saying, look, it doesn't matter our education scores are dropping.
[00:26:11.912 --> 00:26:13.933]  Our children question the status quo.
[00:26:14.932 --> 00:26:18.913]  And we're going to bring down the old system to build the new.
[00:26:18.913 --> 00:26:22.193]  And everybody in the audience of Democrats knew what he was talking about.
[00:26:22.193 --> 00:26:25.894]  He says, you've got to bring down the old system to build a new one.
[00:26:25.894 --> 00:26:29.195]  I mean, literal cloward and piven quote.
[00:26:29.195 --> 00:26:31.495]  That's why I told him, hey, we got a DVR on there.
[00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:32.875]  Back that up.
[00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:34.916]  Record C-SPAN.
[00:26:34.916 --> 00:26:35.936]  It's a C-SPAN TV.
[00:26:35.936 --> 00:26:40.857]  There's a couple of them in there, but I want that clip.
[00:26:40.857 --> 00:26:41.637]  Super creepy.
[00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.051]  That's newsworthy, by the way.
[00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:47.613]  If you take the club about our test scores, people want to criticize those.
[00:26:47.613 --> 00:26:56.858]  Well, at least our kids question the status quo, and people think the Holy Grail is culture and what's been in the past.
[00:26:56.858 --> 00:27:00.660]  Well, I'm not saying we should not innovate, but this isn't innovation.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.641]  This is going back to enslavement.
[00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:03.721]  And they know it.
[00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:05.242]  Oh, don't be married.
[00:27:05.242 --> 00:27:06.123]  Don't have kids.
[00:27:07.421 --> 00:27:10.183]  Live in a tiny apartment so you can pay us more tax money.
[00:27:10.183 --> 00:27:11.283]  Don't have a car.
[00:27:11.283 --> 00:27:12.784]  Don't have air conditioning.
[00:27:12.784 --> 00:27:19.228]  If you live in Africa, lower your expectations because we want everything for ourselves to politically control you.
[00:27:19.228 --> 00:27:24.792]  I mean, that's their stated goal and they're selling it like it's sexy on a high ground.
[00:27:24.792 --> 00:27:27.093]  Talking about how courageous they are to do this.
[00:27:27.093 --> 00:27:31.916]  I mean, I was in there for like three minutes during the break with my mouth hanging open just looking at Biden.
[00:27:33.814 --> 00:27:35.255]  But I'm now digressing.
[00:27:35.255 --> 00:27:36.275]  Here's candidate Obama.
[00:27:36.275 --> 00:27:39.477]  This is an article up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:27:39.477 --> 00:27:43.499]  I will reverse biggest problem of executive abuse of power.
[00:27:43.499 --> 00:27:50.162]  He said no signing statements, five days to read the bills, no lobbyist.
[00:27:50.162 --> 00:27:57.325]  He just, I don't know, executive power grab five times Bush.
[00:27:57.325 --> 00:27:59.166]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:27:59.166 --> 00:28:01.187]  Everything he said he'd do, he did the opposite.
[00:28:02.093 --> 00:28:04.454]  But people who are still Democrats are bought into it.
[00:28:04.454 --> 00:28:07.256]  It's like he's their guy, so you're trying to put down their guy.
[00:28:07.256 --> 00:28:09.477]  Let's go to that clip of El Presidente.
[00:28:09.477 --> 00:28:12.898]  You know, I taught constitutional law for 10 years.
[00:28:12.898 --> 00:28:15.560]  I take the Constitution very seriously.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:25.705]  The biggest problems that we're facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all.
[00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:29.827]  And that's what I intend to reverse when I'm President of the United States of America.
[00:28:31.462 --> 00:28:32.643]  Well, there you go.
[00:28:32.643 --> 00:28:38.528]  Now, you know, who would you want to kill somebody with a knife?
[00:28:38.528 --> 00:28:45.594]  If you had to hire somebody to do it, you'd hire a thoracic surgeon, maybe.
[00:28:45.594 --> 00:28:47.216]  And that's basically what they've done with Obama.
[00:28:47.216 --> 00:28:57.065]  He's a constitutional lawyer, so he knows how to slit the throat of the carotid arteries and the jugulars better than anybody.
[00:28:57.065 --> 00:28:58.526]  And he does know exactly what he's doing.
[00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:04.652]  And now has put his whole agenda into hyper warp drive.
[00:29:04.652 --> 00:29:09.355]  Now this is a short segment, but when we come back I've got a long segment.
[00:29:09.355 --> 00:29:14.478]  I'm going to get into government lays groundwork to confiscate your 401k, read those quotes.
[00:29:14.478 --> 00:29:17.680]  Also report government success in immigration court drops.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:24.385]  Well, yeah, more than half of the illegals that go to immigration court are being let go.
[00:29:24.385 --> 00:29:27.308]  And then Obama does blanket amnesty of most people anyway.
[00:29:27.308 --> 00:29:29.310]  So it's just, it's all by executive power.
[00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.950]  That's in AP.
[00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:35.435]  And we're going to get more into the super winter storm they're calling global warming.
[00:29:35.435 --> 00:29:38.198]  Monopolizing the internet.
[00:29:38.198 --> 00:29:40.180]  Comcast gobbles up Time Warner.
[00:29:41.889 --> 00:29:49.775]  We're also going to get into 44 Dive from Swine Flu in Egypt, a bunch on the NSA, and just a bunch of other really important news.
[00:29:49.775 --> 00:29:51.176]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.176 --> 00:29:53.698]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.698 --> 00:29:56.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.452 --> 00:30:11.139]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:30:11.139 --> 00:30:13.200]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.081]  Fluoride.
[00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:16.002]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:16.002 --> 00:30:22.587]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:27.510]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.191]  Reports documented of 15-point IQ
[00:30:30.532 --> 00:30:31.012]  We're good.
[00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.392]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:31:02.392 --> 00:31:06.035]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:31:06.035 --> 00:31:10.579]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:31:10.579 --> 00:31:16.704]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:31:16.704 --> 00:31:27.494]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:31:27.674 --> 00:31:34.178]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:31:34.178 --> 00:31:51.489]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:31:51.489 --> 00:31:55.912]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at InfoWareStore.com
[00:31:56.072 --> 00:31:58.554]  We're by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:31:58.554 --> 00:32:01.175]  The facts are in.
[00:32:01.175 --> 00:32:02.576]  The studies are legion.
[00:32:02.576 --> 00:32:10.100]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.903]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:32:13.903 --> 00:32:14.483]  Simple.
[00:32:14.483 --> 00:32:19.206]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:32:19.206 --> 00:32:22.428]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:32:22.628 --> 00:32:24.910]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:30.456]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Lite Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:32:30.456 --> 00:32:41.266]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:43.108]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:32:43.228 --> 00:32:45.809]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[00:32:45.809 --> 00:32:47.990]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:53.532]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:32:53.532 --> 00:32:57.933]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:32:57.933 --> 00:32:59.214]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[00:33:29.104 --> 00:33:35.668]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:35.668 --> 00:33:38.050]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:58.413 --> 00:34:17.608]  Talk about Pavlovian.
[00:34:17.608 --> 00:34:19.089]  What is Pavlovian conditioning?
[00:34:19.089 --> 00:34:19.790]  It's just basic
[00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:39.942]  Animal psychology, it's very effective on humans as well, where you ding a bell for a few weeks, couple times a day before you feed dogs, and then you can start ringing the bell, and the dogs will begin to salivate without even the smell of meat.
[00:34:39.942 --> 00:34:42.884]  And that's what the system has basically done.
[00:34:43.809 --> 00:34:56.218]  And a good example of Pavlovian conditioning is having the police come in in drills and teach the kids to put their hands up and to go get on the school buses if they're terrorists, or to have you go through the TSA and be groped and ask questions.
[00:34:56.218 --> 00:35:05.506]  You are Pavlovianly being conditioned to be integrated into a prison state into a system of oppression.
[00:35:05.506 --> 00:35:06.967]  That's a Pavlovian example.
[00:35:06.967 --> 00:35:12.351]  The crew gave me, for my birthday, this coffee cup.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:18.001]  That is basically looks like a handgun going into a coffee cup.
[00:35:18.001 --> 00:35:22.863]  And I noticed this morning, I got some coffee in it because it was one of the clean coffee cups.
[00:35:22.863 --> 00:35:32.927]  And every time I raised it to take a drink for the first time in my life, taking a drink of coffee was very unnerving, very unpleasing.
[00:35:32.927 --> 00:35:39.589]  That's because A, I would never take a handgun unless I was gonna pull the trigger, get my finger anywhere near the trigger.
[00:35:40.714 --> 00:35:47.077]  But I would take a coffee cup and put my hand around the handle, and the handle is a trigger.
[00:35:47.077 --> 00:35:48.798]  So, very unnerving.
[00:35:48.798 --> 00:35:52.000]  In fact, physically makes me sick to drink this.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:01.365]  And I'm glad you guys bought it for me, because it's a nice gift and I like it as a way to illustrate Pavlovian conditioning.
[00:36:01.365 --> 00:36:04.747]  But I'm not claiming I'm some gun master or gun safety king.
[00:36:05.805 --> 00:36:12.689]  But growing up shooting so much since age four, I've been shooting 410 shotguns since I was age four.
[00:36:12.689 --> 00:36:19.772]  And then, you know, shooting high caliber rifles by the time I was six.
[00:36:19.772 --> 00:36:23.234]  And being able to shoot bullseye at 300, 400 yards by the time I was about nine.
[00:36:23.234 --> 00:36:25.975]  Like, I'm not as good a shot now as I was when I was like nine years old.
[00:36:25.975 --> 00:36:28.016]  The senses are just so crisp.
[00:36:28.016 --> 00:36:28.617]  And so on.
[00:36:28.617 --> 00:36:31.578]  And I loved shooting so much when I was younger.
[00:36:31.578 --> 00:36:33.039]  It was just so magic.
[00:36:33.039 --> 00:36:34.620]  I still like it, but nothing like when I was a kid.
[00:36:36.022 --> 00:36:45.615]  And I just have such gun safety and gun awareness, sight awareness of don't aim a gun in anybody's direction.
[00:36:45.615 --> 00:36:48.359]  Don't put your finger on the trigger till you're ready to pull the trigger.
[00:36:48.359 --> 00:36:50.582]  Certainly don't get a gun up in front of your face.
[00:36:53.749 --> 00:37:00.951]  And I took a photo of Mike Judge pointing his M4, but I stuck the cell phone out to get a shot like down the barrel and clicked it that way.
[00:37:00.951 --> 00:37:10.072]  And of course the gun was, he just shot 30 rounds and it was empty and we checked it before we did it too, but the point was even doing that, it was only for cinematic purposes.
[00:37:10.072 --> 00:37:15.774]  And I probably should have had the, you know, a remote control on it or something just to be technical, don't get in front of the barrel of a gun.
[00:37:15.774 --> 00:37:22.155]  Uh, but I'm telling you, it is, it is bizarre to like put this gun up to my mouth.
[00:37:25.919 --> 00:37:28.241]  Probably name that the video on prisonpanda.tv.
[00:37:28.241 --> 00:37:35.368]  A gun to the mouth.
[00:37:35.368 --> 00:37:41.254]  And by the way, all this tyranny, people are deep down scared of what's going on.
[00:37:41.254 --> 00:37:45.257]  They have a feeling of unsettling concern.
[00:37:45.257 --> 00:37:46.498]  They know the system's corrupt.
[00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:48.520]  They know it's predatory.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.501]  But that's subconscious.
[00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:51.203]  The subconscious mind is much more powerful.
[00:37:55.151 --> 00:37:59.375]  The conscious mind just knows that there is anxiety.
[00:37:59.375 --> 00:38:03.318]  The government says, yes, that anxiety is Al Qaeda.
[00:38:03.318 --> 00:38:09.784]  Even though you have a better chance of dying from a deer jumping out in front of your car, being stung by a wasp, or honeybees separately.
[00:38:09.784 --> 00:38:13.648]  Wasps kill more people every year than terrorism in the U.S.
[00:38:13.648 --> 00:38:15.449]  Honeybees kill more per capita.
[00:38:15.449 --> 00:38:16.650]  This is each group.
[00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:20.394]  Yellowjackets kill more people each year by themselves than terrorism.
[00:38:22.665 --> 00:38:30.528]  But our entire way of life is being changed by the political class, completely transparently, to dominate and control in the name of it.
[00:38:30.528 --> 00:38:33.629]  Total social conditioning.
[00:38:33.629 --> 00:38:46.755]  And now they admit Homeland Security is for the American people, and their new enemy is gun-owning, returning veterans, libertarians, conservatives, who they have the military openly training for war with.
[00:38:46.755 --> 00:38:50.076]  And that should be a huge wake-up call to everyone out there
[00:38:52.526 --> 00:39:05.731]  When Bush was doing some light persecution of Democrats, banning free speech, putting in free speech zones of the RNC and things, I went and decried it.
[00:39:05.731 --> 00:39:06.932]  I went and almost got arrested.
[00:39:06.932 --> 00:39:08.392]  I had members of my crew arrested.
[00:39:08.392 --> 00:39:12.294]  They arrested some of my guys when I was in a separate area than them.
[00:39:16.095 --> 00:39:17.256]  And I knew we'd get arrested.
[00:39:17.256 --> 00:39:17.756]  I figured.
[00:39:17.756 --> 00:39:20.758]  So that's why I say, you know, I basically got us arrested going down there.
[00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:21.718]  Rob Due got arrested.
[00:39:21.718 --> 00:39:24.220]  I've been arrested before.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.142]  Actually, I forgot I was arrested that time in New York.
[00:39:27.142 --> 00:39:29.603]  But I wasn't arrested as part of the RNC deal.
[00:39:29.603 --> 00:39:30.744]  That was days before.
[00:39:30.744 --> 00:39:31.384]  See, I forget.
[00:39:31.384 --> 00:39:33.045]  It all blurs together.
[00:39:33.045 --> 00:39:36.267]  I've been arrested quite a few times demonstrating.
[00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:40.710]  I was protesting media propaganda when I got arrested in New York.
[00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.391]  When Geraldo Rivera was in an outdoor deal.
[00:39:44.261 --> 00:39:46.082]  And notice Geraldo Rivera doesn't dislike me now.
[00:39:46.082 --> 00:39:49.463]  He says he admires me on and off air before when I've been on his show.
[00:39:49.463 --> 00:39:52.405]  He's been on this one all because I did go bullhorn him.
[00:39:52.405 --> 00:39:55.446]  All because I did go get arrested.
[00:39:55.446 --> 00:39:56.767]  And you're like, wouldn't he hate me?
[00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:58.327]  He was flipping me off at the time.
[00:39:58.327 --> 00:40:02.529]  Well, that's because people were saying they were going to kick his ass.
[00:40:02.529 --> 00:40:03.770]  It wasn't me saying that.
[00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.871]  So like any red-blooded guy, he said, oh really?
[00:40:05.871 --> 00:40:08.732]  I'll climb out of this thing after the thing if you think you're going to do that.
[00:40:08.732 --> 00:40:10.813]  And I looked up Geraldo Rivera.
[00:40:10.813 --> 00:40:12.714]  He does have a history of being a scrapper in New York.
[00:40:13.976 --> 00:40:17.197]  Arrested for that and other things as a political activist.
[00:40:17.197 --> 00:40:20.999]  But the whole point is, is that's the animating contest of liberty.
[00:40:20.999 --> 00:40:37.847]  That's what life is all about and I've digressed off into Bush and how I protested him some and got arrested for violating free speech and then Obama does it and I have articles, mainstream articles, where Democrats go,
[00:40:39.372 --> 00:40:44.054]  Forget, you know, going after the IRS for targeting the Tea Party and Pro-Life and Christians.
[00:40:44.054 --> 00:40:46.114]  We want you to go after them more.
[00:40:46.114 --> 00:40:46.895]  Get rid of them.
[00:40:46.895 --> 00:40:49.256]  They should be illegal.
[00:40:49.256 --> 00:40:53.617]  Just like the governor of New York said, if you're a Pro-Life or a gun owner, get out of the state.
[00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.978]  Quote, you're not welcome here.
[00:40:54.978 --> 00:40:56.398]  You're not what New York is.
[00:40:56.398 --> 00:40:57.478]  We define.
[00:40:57.478 --> 00:40:58.599]  How is that liberal?
[00:41:00.353 --> 00:41:02.333]  Liberalism is about real tolerance.
[00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:03.814]  Liberalism is about live and let live.
[00:41:03.814 --> 00:41:09.235]  Liberalism is about giving you as much of your money and the right to live your life as you see fit.
[00:41:09.235 --> 00:41:11.676]  I'm for drug decriminalization.
[00:41:11.676 --> 00:41:12.996]  I'm for national sovereignty.
[00:41:12.996 --> 00:41:16.997]  I'm for low taxes.
[00:41:16.997 --> 00:41:19.557]  I'm for having a small government.
[00:41:19.557 --> 00:41:21.818]  I'm for having local control.
[00:41:21.818 --> 00:41:24.658]  I'm for having labeling on products so you know what you're eating.
[00:41:24.658 --> 00:41:26.139]  Is that liberal or conservative?
[00:41:26.139 --> 00:41:26.779]  No, that's liberal.
[00:41:28.203 --> 00:41:31.765]  But not in the liberal context of the modern liberal.
[00:41:31.765 --> 00:41:54.721]  These are nothing but moral, high-ground people in a confidence game that are corporate con-artist technicians, whose opposition is a bunch of corrupt, blue-blood, country-club, idiot Republicans, who are owned by the same special interests that are busy destroying our entire future and our civilization, all so they can be king of the hill.
[00:41:54.721 --> 00:41:56.262]  King of a pile of horse manure.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:18.768]  I'd rather be a third of the way down the hill or at the bottom of the hill in a wondrous free market quasi-utopia of adventurism and trailblazing and celebrating femininity, celebrating masculinity, but celebrating all forms of art and culture, the entire spectrum of it.
[00:42:18.768 --> 00:42:22.290]  That's real liberalism, is celebrating humanity.
[00:42:23.303 --> 00:42:35.045]  Not saying it's all screwed up, the government has to tell it what to do, and then the government people are the worst of the worst of the worst kleptocratic, narcissistic, power-tripping scum.
[00:42:39.721 --> 00:42:41.943]  I think Mark Moreno's on at 1230, right?
[00:42:41.943 --> 00:42:45.405]  Yeah, so we'll open the phones up so I can go in at the end of the hour into the next hour.
[00:42:45.405 --> 00:42:48.807]  I've already thrown a lot of news items, but I want to get your take on all of it.
[00:42:48.807 --> 00:42:51.850]  We're going to do first-time callers again today.
[00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:53.511]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:53.591]  800-259-9231.
[00:42:53.591 --> 00:42:56.593]  And I'm not trying to sound like Bill Clinton today.
[00:42:56.593 --> 00:42:59.115]  I've got a little bit of a lung infection, a small one.
[00:43:09.926 --> 00:43:23.131]  I think down in the bronchia, right where the windpipe splits off, and it, you know how it is, it scratches and itches and you want to cough, but then that would distract the whole show.
[00:43:23.131 --> 00:43:30.754]  It's kind of like a laced potato chip, once you eat one you can't stop, so why start coughing?
[00:43:30.754 --> 00:43:34.395]  But I could do a really good Bill Clinton today with my voice this shot.
[00:43:34.395 --> 00:43:39.097]  I was absolutely, listen here, I have never lied to anybody in my life.
[00:43:40.555 --> 00:43:45.697]  The reason I keep bringing Bill Clinton back up, regular listeners know we hardly ever talk about Bill Clinton.
[00:43:45.697 --> 00:43:54.641]  But I feel like I'm 22 years old again on talk radio, and Bill Clinton is in office, and I'm marveling at all the crimes, and how he got away with them.
[00:43:54.641 --> 00:44:04.184]  And then like a demonic jack-in-the-box, or a new moon that pops up every cycle, we're now faced with the fourth administration.
[00:44:04.184 --> 00:44:04.985]  No, no, no.
[00:44:04.985 --> 00:44:06.485]  The fifth administration.
[00:44:06.485 --> 00:44:07.686]  Because you had Hillary and Bill,
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.861]  The co-presidency, one and two.
[00:44:11.861 --> 00:44:16.423]  Now you've had two presidencies of Obozo.
[00:44:16.423 --> 00:44:17.583]  Almost two.
[00:44:17.583 --> 00:44:20.064]  You know, one and a half, so that's three and a half.
[00:44:20.064 --> 00:44:27.006]  And then when he leaves and they get Hillary in, that's five Clinton cycles.
[00:44:27.006 --> 00:44:32.028]  I mean, this is really becoming like some North Korean ascension ritual or something.
[00:44:32.028 --> 00:44:36.830]  And so I'm just seeing Hillary everywhere in the news, and then every time I see her, all the crimes pop up in my head.
[00:44:38.502 --> 00:44:39.522]  There's Kurt Nemo's article.
[00:44:39.522 --> 00:44:44.104]  Hillary Clinton's unethical, dishonest behavior should be fair game during presidential race.
[00:44:44.104 --> 00:44:47.045]  Republicans need to begin work now on taking her down.
[00:44:47.045 --> 00:44:49.745]  And here is a bounty of ammo for the job.
[00:44:49.745 --> 00:44:57.568]  Yeah, but as long as you step and fetch and go along with these crooks, they won't set you up when they get back in power with the IRS or their hit teams.
[00:44:58.826 --> 00:44:59.827]  Whatever.
[00:44:59.827 --> 00:45:00.788]  I'm on their enemies list.
[00:45:00.788 --> 00:45:01.148]  I know that.
[00:45:01.148 --> 00:45:02.970]  It's come out in the news.
[00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.431]  And we're all on their enemies list.
[00:45:04.431 --> 00:45:06.733]  You don't get anywhere going along with these people.
[00:45:06.733 --> 00:45:10.796]  But the Republican leadership, again, are paid for by the very same special interests in many cases.
[00:45:10.796 --> 00:45:12.718]  And so they won't go after her.
[00:45:12.718 --> 00:45:21.045]  They will let them sit there and persecute anybody who is right of Stalin using their political paradigm.
[00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:31.371]  I mean, all I want is to not have you shut down all the power plants, and shut down all the factories we've got left, and totally gut the country so we can live under your hellish rule.
[00:45:31.371 --> 00:45:34.852]  I mean, you people really want misery and evil.
[00:45:34.852 --> 00:45:39.074]  You're a plague!
[00:45:39.074 --> 00:45:45.538]  I think I gotta think about the Democrats, it's like I think about... I don't know, maybe...
[00:45:46.823 --> 00:45:48.465]  Glaucoma or something.
[00:45:48.465 --> 00:45:49.466]  It's not even a hatred.
[00:45:49.466 --> 00:45:52.449]  It's like a disease you're scared of and went out of your life.
[00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:59.817]  That family that has glaucoma, you know, basically gone pretty much blind from it.
[00:45:59.817 --> 00:46:00.638]  And that's what it's like.
[00:46:00.638 --> 00:46:01.699]  They're spiritually blind.
[00:46:01.699 --> 00:46:02.600]  They're like a disease.
[00:46:04.056 --> 00:46:07.798]  You know, oh, Katie bar the door, may that day not come.
[00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:10.500]  And it's just like, it just keeps coming and coming and coming.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.462]  I mean, I'm looking at a photo of Michelle Obama right now.
[00:46:13.462 --> 00:46:22.848]  She is so flamingly evil and hateful and demonic looking.
[00:46:22.848 --> 00:46:26.351]  I mean, she just looks like an evil vampire in a movie.
[00:46:26.351 --> 00:46:30.013]  And I've got to hear how beautiful she is every day and then walk to the grocery store.
[00:46:30.013 --> 00:46:32.615]  She's in all the women's mags and I'm just so sick of it.
[00:46:33.865 --> 00:46:37.728]  Now you put snakes on her head, man, it's Medusa!
[00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:43.373]  And I don't just go off of how she looks, it's just like... That's what I'm telling you, it's like Gerald Salente says, politics is, uh...
[00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:46.849]  Showbiz for ugly people, and that's what it is.
[00:46:46.849 --> 00:47:00.172]  It's these ugly, culturally ugly people, spiritually ugly people, politically ugly people, who I know are crooks who want to bankrupt the country in their own words to take over society, and I can't get them out of my life.
[00:47:00.172 --> 00:47:02.333]  You know, I can tune into what I want to tune into.
[00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:05.193]  Most of the time I can go watch movies I want to watch.
[00:47:05.193 --> 00:47:09.094]  I can read what I want to read, but I've got to cover politics, so I've remained somewhat free.
[00:47:10.074 --> 00:47:19.882]  So I'm forced, in this contest, to know about these people.
[00:47:19.882 --> 00:47:21.164]  Unbelievable.
[00:47:21.164 --> 00:47:23.626]  I'm ranting and there's news to cover and I apologize.
[00:47:23.626 --> 00:47:26.488]  I've been digressing here today.
[00:47:26.488 --> 00:47:28.570]  Let's just start where I said I would start.
[00:47:30.632 --> 00:47:35.275]  Lays groundwork, and confiscate your 401k and your IRA.
[00:47:35.275 --> 00:47:37.516]  This is happening, is the quote.
[00:47:37.516 --> 00:47:42.619]  That's from Max Slavo up on InfoWars.com.
[00:47:42.619 --> 00:47:49.344]  He does a great job boiling down a Zero Hedge article out of a Reuters story.
[00:47:49.344 --> 00:47:54.387]  And it says, as noted by Zero Hedge, there's no longer turning exclusively to central bankers.
[00:47:55.765 --> 00:48:20.897]  So we print money as needed because last year's bank bail-in forced the confiscation of funds from an average depositors of 40% I should add working as well in Cyprus as EU regulators and bankers have determined that they'll use a similar method to fund the future endeavors and they go on and I've been telling you this forever because they've done this in every other third world country and the globalists when they leaked the documents in 2002 and Joe Stiglitz went public, head economist at the World Bank
[00:48:22.679 --> 00:48:31.509]  That there's a plan to do this to the Western world to then make us politically bankrupt and financially bankrupt for good.
[00:48:31.509 --> 00:48:37.075]  And now they're moving with the bank regulations, everything for that and the conditioning.
[00:48:37.075 --> 00:48:43.082]  And we as a society need to say no to them actually taking
[00:48:44.224 --> 00:48:48.725]  Money out of your 401k or out of your IRA or out of your bank account.
[00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:54.067]  And as I always told you, to quote, stabilize the system and keep it safe.
[00:48:54.067 --> 00:48:59.168]  And they take it and then they take 20-30% up front and they go, but we stabilized it.
[00:48:59.168 --> 00:49:02.009]  And then they'll run the market back up, it'll go back up a little bit.
[00:49:02.009 --> 00:49:04.070]  And so now the precedent's set.
[00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:09.472]  Then over the next decade, this has to be done in every third world country, they take everything.
[00:49:09.472 --> 00:49:10.932]  And you're just happy to be getting something.
[00:49:12.506 --> 00:49:17.567]  And the reason I knew exactly what they would do is they've done this hundreds of times.
[00:49:17.567 --> 00:49:22.788]  Sometimes four, five, six times the last hundred years per third world country they control.
[00:49:22.788 --> 00:49:26.549]  So this will happen if we don't say no.
[00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:31.730]  That's what the armored vehicles, the machine guns, the helicopters, the data mining are.
[00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:35.871]  That if you try to get in the way of this, they're going to arrest you and say you're a terrorist.
[00:49:35.871 --> 00:49:38.572]  I mean, come on, police and military, everybody.
[00:49:38.572 --> 00:49:40.152]  We all know who the real terrorists are.
[00:49:40.925 --> 00:49:45.906]  Okay, we know who openly says they want to bankrupt us to make us controlled by them.
[00:49:45.906 --> 00:49:53.148]  If you're in the system and you serve this, it's like helping the Soviets take over Poland, or the Ukraine, or the Czech Republic.
[00:49:53.148 --> 00:49:58.249]  I mean, you're really on the bad guy team.
[00:49:58.249 --> 00:50:03.790]  There's a lot of propaganda out there saying you're good guys, there's a lot of missions you do that are good missions.
[00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.010]  But it doesn't matter, you still are working for bad people.
[00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:09.831]  And look, I'm talking about everybody from the bureaucracy, you name it.
[00:50:11.052 --> 00:50:20.580]  When I pay the fake taxes of the IRS, knowing they're a mafia that could literally break my legs because I want to be able to choose my battles and keep getting the word out, I know I'm contributing to our destruction as well.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:23.342]  I'm not judging you police that stay in the corrupt system.
[00:50:23.342 --> 00:50:28.607]  Quite frankly, I hope good cops stay in and can put up with it so there can be some good people in there down the road.
[00:50:28.607 --> 00:50:30.048]  But I mean, let's just all admit it.
[00:50:30.048 --> 00:50:32.310]  We're all contributing to our own destruction.
[00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:32.810]  Listen to this.
[00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.892]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:50:34.892 --> 00:50:35.513]  In a nutshell,
[00:50:37.045 --> 00:50:47.151]  Reuters reports, the savings of the European Union's 500 million citizens could be used to fund long-term investments to boost the economy and help plug the gap left by banks since the financial crisis.
[00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:49.332]  See, the banks create it, they get your money.
[00:50:49.332 --> 00:50:59.599]  And it goes on, the solution is not just in Europe, but here, to mobilize more personal pension savings for long-term financing, the document said, from the EU, and the Federal Reserve concurs.

[00:51:35.775 --> 00:51:40.617]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[00:51:40.617 --> 00:51:45.958]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.

[00:54:01.567 --> 00:54:08.149]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:37.128 --> 00:54:38.668]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:38.668 --> 00:54:41.009]  I was busy printing off this article.
[00:54:41.009 --> 00:54:44.490]  Almost didn't make it in the chair in time before the bumper ended.
[00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:45.710]  Expert!
[00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:52.432]  Iran ships a dry run for later nuclear EMP attack to humiliate Obama.
[00:54:52.432 --> 00:54:56.753]  Again, I've been anti-Iran war folks, but Iran, after all these peace overtures,
[00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:02.618]  is really trying to stir stuff up with video showing Tel Aviv being attacked, U.S.
[00:55:02.618 --> 00:55:16.407]  aircraft carriers being attacked, their chairman joint chief saying that they have the power with sleeper teams to wreak havoc all over the West in non-conventional warfare and says the U.S.
[00:55:16.407 --> 00:55:17.128]  doesn't know that.
[00:55:17.128 --> 00:55:19.969]  I mean, give me a break!
[00:55:19.969 --> 00:55:26.414]  The U.S., the people running this country wrote the book on evil and double-twisted quadruple crossing.
[00:55:27.489 --> 00:55:30.412]  That's why they put the Mulas in power in 79.
[00:55:30.412 --> 00:55:31.193]  Look it up.
[00:55:31.193 --> 00:55:34.136]  It's been partially declassified.
[00:55:34.136 --> 00:55:39.742]  Criminal elements of Western governments kicked the Shaw out and put the Mulas in there.
[00:55:39.742 --> 00:55:42.865]  And I'm not saying they run them.
[00:55:42.865 --> 00:55:44.948]  I'm saying they're making deals with them.
[00:55:44.948 --> 00:55:47.931]  I guarantee you that they've got to now play the part of the devil.
[00:55:49.235 --> 00:55:52.656]  And it's very sophisticated what's going on.
[00:55:52.656 --> 00:55:59.238]  Or they think with the peace overtures that the West is weak and are pushing it with megalomania, really asking for it.
[00:55:59.238 --> 00:56:02.779]  And more and more, I think that might be it, actually.
[00:56:02.779 --> 00:56:04.139]  That might be it.
[00:56:04.139 --> 00:56:09.621]  Like Hitler, you know, he's already losing against the West, so he turns into Russia with Operation Baba Rosa.
[00:56:09.621 --> 00:56:12.321]  I mean, Napoleon Bonaparte did the same thing.
[00:56:12.321 --> 00:56:14.162]  So maybe it is just the mania.
[00:56:14.162 --> 00:56:17.583]  Because, you know, I look at the globalists, they're losing on many fronts right now.
[00:56:18.685 --> 00:56:22.188]  They've been winning so long they were ahead of us, but we're gaining quickly.
[00:56:22.188 --> 00:56:24.069]  Free humanity is.
[00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:27.552]  And I look at how they act all crazy and full of arrogance.
[00:56:27.552 --> 00:56:31.655]  The Iranians just may be out of their minds.
[00:56:31.655 --> 00:56:37.680]  So if the Iranians continue to act like this, I'm going to wash my hands, because I've really tried to stop war over there.
[00:56:38.925 --> 00:56:46.269]  I've tried to stop the attack on Syria and it's come out in the London Telegraph that Infowars.com is used by talking points by Assad.
[00:56:46.269 --> 00:56:49.430]  I'm not bragging, it's almost embarrassing, but the truth is the truth.
[00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:54.032]  We understand the politics to the level of that these governments are actually looking at what we say.
[00:56:54.032 --> 00:56:55.633]  I know the Iranians listen to me.
[00:56:55.633 --> 00:56:57.494]  They invite me on their state-run TV every day.
[00:56:57.494 --> 00:57:02.036]  I say no because I'm busy and, you know, just quite frankly, I just can't handle it.
[00:57:02.036 --> 00:57:03.877]  And now, you know what?
[00:57:03.877 --> 00:57:05.258]  I want to go on press TV.
[00:57:05.258 --> 00:57:05.958]  You want me to come on?
[00:57:05.958 --> 00:57:06.939]  I'll tell you what I think about this.
[00:57:07.995 --> 00:57:14.437]  Because I go and I look this stuff up, and this is not Israeli propaganda.
[00:57:14.437 --> 00:57:29.240]  I've seen Israeli propaganda when the last president of Iran would make statements like, you know, we need to wipe the Zionist regime off the political map, and they would translate it to, we need to blow Israel up.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.901]  Didn't exactly say that.
[00:57:31.901 --> 00:57:33.161]  Trying to get war going.
[00:57:33.161 --> 00:57:35.162]  And it's not that I dislike Israel, I just looked at the
[00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:39.992]  The way the breaks are here, like in a pool game, this is not good for anybody.
[00:57:39.992 --> 00:57:42.093]  That's why our Joint Chiefs didn't want a war with Iran.
[00:57:42.093 --> 00:57:44.395]  It doesn't have good outcomes for anybody.
[00:57:44.395 --> 00:57:46.556]  It just goes from bad to worse.
[00:57:46.556 --> 00:57:51.919]  And then I look at their Supreme Commander saying they've got sleeper cells and America's dumb.
[00:57:51.919 --> 00:57:55.381]  Look, the globalists pray you release sleeper cells.
[00:57:55.381 --> 00:58:02.265]  They're going to be able to take over the entire system and get rid of all our liberties and concentrate the economy in their criminal hands if you people
[00:58:03.504 --> 00:58:08.985]  Think America backed off because they're weak, and then you go start something, idiots.
[00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:09.405]  You are.
[00:58:09.405 --> 00:58:10.926]  You're idiots.
[00:58:10.926 --> 00:58:17.867]  You're either playing a double game with the New World Order with this rhetoric, or you've gone megalomaniac.
[00:58:17.867 --> 00:58:22.208]  All I care about is stability in the future and rule of law.
[00:58:22.208 --> 00:58:23.969]  I want to have grandkids, you morons.
[00:58:23.969 --> 00:58:29.850]  Let me tell you, Iran, since they got this peace deal, have been acting like absolute crazy people.
[00:58:31.479 --> 00:58:31.960]  Whatever.
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:33.802]  That's just very upsetting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:33.802 --> 00:58:35.724]  Very upsetting.
[00:58:35.724 --> 00:58:36.485]  We'll be right back.

[00:58:56.286 --> 00:59:03.675]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:59:03.675 --> 00:59:07.039]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:59:07.039 --> 00:59:08.802]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:59:09.042 --> 00:59:13.705]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:59:13.705 --> 00:59:16.627]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:59:16.627 --> 00:59:22.590]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.

[01:00:13.344 --> 01:00:17.530]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:21.595]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.018 --> 01:00:29.944]  Coming up, I'm going to decode some very cryptic babblings of Joe Biden that I just saw on C-SPAN a few minutes ago.
[01:00:29.944 --> 01:00:31.505]  I've not seen in the news.
[01:00:31.505 --> 01:00:33.527]  Nancy Pelosi says, hey, who wants to get married?
[01:00:33.527 --> 01:00:34.788]  Don't get married.
[01:00:34.788 --> 01:00:37.170]  Give those kids to the state.
[01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:44.036]  Coming up, Mark Moreno, CBS expert, says extreme cold caused by excess heat.
[01:00:44.036 --> 01:00:48.860]  By the way, here's the Climate Depot article that I want posted in full on Infowars.com, guys.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.422]  CBS features Futurist.
[01:00:51.693 --> 01:00:53.533]  Hello Alex, how are you doing?
[01:00:53.533 --> 01:00:54.053]  I'm alright.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.982]  I'm calling about the Steve Stockman campaign.
[01:01:20.982 --> 01:01:22.423]  We've got to defeat Corrin.
[01:01:22.423 --> 01:01:23.784]  Corrin funded Obamacare.
[01:01:23.784 --> 01:01:33.992]  He also voted this week, along with the trader Mitch McConnell, to give unlimited spending to Obama for the next year, through 2015, raising the debt ceiling.
[01:01:33.992 --> 01:01:34.812]  We have to defeat who?
[01:01:34.812 --> 01:01:38.115]  We need to defeat John Corrin.
[01:01:38.115 --> 01:01:40.557]  Oh, you're talking about Senator Corrin, yes.
[01:01:40.557 --> 01:01:43.899]  Yes, Senator Corrin, basically.
[01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:51.737]  He has these ads going.
[01:01:51.737 --> 01:01:55.021]  He goes, I have guns, you have guns.
[01:01:55.021 --> 01:01:56.182]  We like guns.
[01:01:56.182 --> 01:01:57.323]  Vote for me.
[01:01:57.323 --> 01:01:59.646]  No, he's definitely a rhino.
[01:01:59.646 --> 01:02:04.231]  And who would you like to see in there other than John Cornyn?
[01:02:05.247 --> 01:02:06.228]  Steve Stockman.
[01:02:06.228 --> 01:02:09.370]  Steve Stockman currently is a congressman from Texas.
[01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:11.031]  He has never voted to raise the debt ceiling.
[01:02:36.523 --> 01:02:38.044]  Uh, I guess I must be.
[01:02:38.044 --> 01:02:40.165]  Yeah, you don't laugh at our Lord and Savior.
[01:02:40.165 --> 01:02:44.006]  Again, I'm not blasphemous, but that's what Jamie Foxx calls him.
[01:02:44.006 --> 01:02:45.687]  So, I appreciate your call.
[01:02:45.687 --> 01:02:47.027]  Yeah, we gotta get rid of John Cornyn.
[01:02:47.027 --> 01:02:57.812]  Get rid of all the Republican neocons that are saying, be nice Tea Party, be nice Libertarians, while they try to raise record money with the Democrats to beat the Tea Party.
[01:02:57.812 --> 01:02:59.592]  Let's go to Bill in Wisconsin.
[01:02:59.592 --> 01:03:00.192]  You're on the air.
[01:03:00.192 --> 01:03:00.953]  First time caller.
[01:03:00.953 --> 01:03:01.233]  Welcome.
[01:03:02.739 --> 01:03:03.279]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.441]  Doing alright, brother.
[01:03:05.441 --> 01:03:06.562]  Okay.
[01:03:06.562 --> 01:03:15.991]  What I'm concerned about, I was on the LaRouche PAC activist conference call last night.
[01:03:15.991 --> 01:03:18.333]  Yesterday, Congress passed 362 to 2
[01:03:21.696 --> 01:03:26.897]  With some votes, you know, not being coming forward.
[01:03:26.897 --> 01:03:29.778]  But Walter Jones was one of the two.
[01:03:29.778 --> 01:03:36.719]  I think there was another Republican from Kentucky that voted against this.
[01:03:36.719 --> 01:03:43.981]  Now what this was, was a resolution in support of the George Soros
[01:03:45.266 --> 01:03:52.571]  A bunch of protesters that are attempting to attack the Ukraine.
[01:03:52.571 --> 01:04:02.597]  No, exactly, and it's not like we're saying side with Russia, but the EU wants to suck Ukraine dry and move weapons in to start a fight with Russia, and that's immoral.
[01:04:02.597 --> 01:04:06.359]  And yes, I know they had that resolution in Congress, that's disgusting.
[01:04:06.359 --> 01:04:11.302]  Yeah, this is a declaration of war, essentially, against Russia.
[01:04:12.171 --> 01:04:19.837]  And the LaRouche people are working for the impeachment of Obama.
[01:04:19.837 --> 01:04:21.519]  When am I getting LaRoucher's wife on?
[01:04:21.519 --> 01:04:23.260]  They're on next week.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.363]  Get them on, get them on for Pete's sake.
[01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:29.165]  We are on the cusp.
[01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:35.612]  I know, I know.
[01:04:35.612 --> 01:04:39.634]  No, no, that's what's crazy.
[01:04:39.634 --> 01:04:40.415]  That's what's crazy.
[01:04:40.415 --> 01:04:41.696]  Stan, I'm going to come back to you.
[01:04:41.696 --> 01:04:43.877]  Recap your thoughts about you, because it is.
[01:04:43.877 --> 01:04:47.619]  Every mainline analyst says we're in more danger now than the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:51.561]  And this time it's not the Soviets who are the overall bad guys starting everything.
[01:04:51.561 --> 01:04:57.484]  Our government, run by a bunch of Wall Street crazy guys, that'll make 400 to 1 bets like John Corzine did.
[01:04:57.484 --> 01:04:58.525]  These guys are crazy.
[01:05:00.572 --> 01:05:03.913]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:05:03.913 --> 01:05:06.334]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:05:06.334 --> 01:05:14.938]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:05:14.938 --> 01:05:30.244]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[01:05:30.504 --> 01:05:31.024]  I'm good.
[01:06:00.604 --> 01:06:09.690]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:18.095]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:06:18.095 --> 01:06:22.758]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:29.761]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:29.761 --> 01:06:36.945]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:06:36.945 --> 01:06:43.968]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:06:43.968 --> 01:06:48.450]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:51.672]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:06:51.832 --> 01:06:58.115]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:06:58.115 --> 01:07:00.597]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:00.597 --> 01:07:02.498]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:07:02.498 --> 01:07:06.139]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[01:07:06.139 --> 01:07:10.682]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:07:10.682 --> 01:07:13.003]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and
[01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:16.785]  And up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:07:16.785 --> 01:07:27.793]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:34.277]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[01:07:34.277 --> 01:07:40.682]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides,
[01:07:40.942 --> 01:07:42.663]  Do you know why that was not done?
[01:08:03.484 --> 01:08:05.726]  There are exceptions to that rule.
[01:08:05.726 --> 01:08:06.888]  I do not know, however.
[01:08:06.888 --> 01:08:10.091]  Again, Mr. Chairman, I don't know.
[01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:11.172]  I don't know.
[01:08:11.172 --> 01:08:12.694]  I don't know.
[01:08:12.694 --> 01:08:13.414]  I don't know.
[01:08:13.414 --> 01:08:14.115]  I don't know.
[01:08:14.115 --> 01:08:15.156]  I don't know.
[01:08:15.156 --> 01:08:16.718]  I don't know.
[01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:17.559]  That I don't know.
[01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:18.360]  I just don't know.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:21.002]  I don't know whether or not... I just don't know.
[01:08:21.002 --> 01:08:24.606]  I don't know exactly how IRS has constructed it.
[01:08:24.606 --> 01:08:25.848]  I don't know when the subpoena was issued.
[01:08:26.508 --> 01:08:28.329]  Well, I don't know precisely.
[01:08:28.329 --> 01:08:29.269]  I don't know.
[01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.789]  I don't know.
[01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:32.670]  I don't know the specific questions.
[01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:33.850]  Again, I don't know what happened.
[01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:35.371]  Well, either you know or you don't know.
[01:08:35.371 --> 01:08:35.851]  I don't know.
[01:08:35.851 --> 01:08:37.131]  I don't know.
[01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:38.672]  I don't know.
[01:08:38.672 --> 01:08:39.772]  I don't know.
[01:08:39.772 --> 01:08:40.532]  I just don't know when.
[01:08:40.532 --> 01:08:42.393]  I don't know.
[01:08:42.393 --> 01:08:44.173]  I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
[01:08:44.173 --> 01:08:45.934]  All right.
[01:08:45.934 --> 01:08:46.694]  I did not know.
[01:08:46.694 --> 01:08:48.755]  I don't know what you are going to ask me.
[01:08:48.755 --> 01:08:49.295]  I didn't know.
[01:08:49.295 --> 01:08:52.356]  Technically, I don't know.
[01:08:52.356 --> 01:08:53.396]  I don't know.
[01:08:53.396 --> 01:08:54.256]  I don't know.
[01:09:03.841 --> 01:09:08.983]  But they are openly persecuting the Tea Party, big time.
[01:09:08.983 --> 01:09:16.826]  Any conservative or libertarian group, pro-life groups, you name it, they're all being persecuted by the, I don't know, Criminal Justice Department.
[01:09:16.826 --> 01:09:20.387]  Caught committing so many crimes openly, it makes my head spin.
[01:09:20.387 --> 01:09:24.849]  We're going back to your calls with Bill and Art and Terry and Lee.
[01:09:26.221 --> 01:09:35.083]  And Mike and so many others, 800-259-9231, first-time callers, for taking your calls here today, now into the second hour.
[01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:39.124]  This is some of the news breaking up on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:39.124 --> 01:09:40.844]  Right now, U.S.
[01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:47.386]  Army builds fake city in Virginia to practice military occupation.
[01:09:47.386 --> 01:09:48.466]  Martial law training?
[01:09:48.466 --> 01:09:53.587]  300-acre town includes sports stadium, school, underground subway.
[01:09:54.261 --> 01:09:55.842]  Well, Paul asked that question.
[01:09:55.842 --> 01:09:57.783]  It's all over the news.
[01:09:57.783 --> 01:09:58.163]  The U.S.
[01:09:58.163 --> 01:10:07.969]  Army admits their main threat is Tea Party insurgents, and he links to the West Point training manuals in the Infowars.com article.
[01:10:07.969 --> 01:10:13.072]  And, of course, the National Guard training, DrudgeReport.com, carried it this week.
[01:10:13.072 --> 01:10:14.473]  It was all over the news.
[01:10:14.473 --> 01:10:20.937]  Training to, quote, take on the Tea Party when they use bioweapons to attack because they're pro-Second Amendment supporters.
[01:10:21.966 --> 01:10:25.488]  So, you're like, yeah, but that doesn't have any basis in reality.
[01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:27.410]  It's called a demonization campaign.
[01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:29.331]  They had a political open persecution.
[01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:31.612]  They're already using the IRS and everything on people.
[01:10:31.612 --> 01:10:33.253]  I mean, we're in trouble.
[01:10:33.253 --> 01:10:36.916]  A lot of folks are like, well, I better go hoist an Obama flag.
[01:10:36.916 --> 01:10:44.080]  When they've gotten rid of their opposition, they're going to go after everybody, including their moron idiot supporters.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.301]  That's the way this works.
[01:10:45.301 --> 01:10:49.524]  They hate their moron supporters even more than they hate those of us that oppose them.
[01:10:50.523 --> 01:10:51.463]  People better study history.
[01:10:51.463 --> 01:10:56.025]  Those of you who think you're on some winning team serving this.
[01:10:56.025 --> 01:10:56.585]  Amazing.
[01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.066]  I want to send reporters to cover that.
[01:10:58.066 --> 01:11:00.026]  That's interesting.
[01:11:00.026 --> 01:11:05.868]  Oregon police give nightclubs ID scanners to determine customers' identities and age.
[01:11:05.868 --> 01:11:13.551]  I love how I've seen this for 15 years or more, where they'll card an old woman buying pipe tobacco for her husband or a six-pack of beer at the drugstore.
[01:11:14.793 --> 01:11:16.254]  And I always go, why are you doing that?
[01:11:16.254 --> 01:11:17.875]  Well, we have to swipe it.
[01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:23.619]  State police like it when we do that, or the Texas Department of TBI, what's it called?
[01:11:23.619 --> 01:11:26.020]  What's the alcohol department called?
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.942]  T-A-B-C, yeah.
[01:11:27.942 --> 01:11:32.865]  So, it's like, well, we just better swipe everybody, because first it was, if you look under 21, we card you.
[01:11:32.865 --> 01:11:34.526]  Then it's, if you look under 30, we card you.
[01:11:34.526 --> 01:11:37.448]  Now it's like, old man on a walker, we're going to card you.
[01:11:38.991 --> 01:11:41.351]  And then now you go in to get stuff at the drugstore over the counter.
[01:11:41.351 --> 01:11:42.432]  Oh, we're going to swipe your card.
[01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:43.772]  Oh, it goes in a database.
[01:11:43.772 --> 01:11:47.793]  And then it's all shared under Obamacare.
[01:11:47.793 --> 01:11:48.773]  All given to everybody.
[01:11:48.773 --> 01:11:53.994]  Why do we ever have privacy to begin with?
[01:11:53.994 --> 01:11:56.614]  By the way, Sean Parker is in the news.
[01:11:56.614 --> 01:11:59.355]  I met Sean Parker.
[01:11:59.355 --> 01:12:02.875]  Billionaire Sean Parker hates the world he helped create.
[01:12:06.465 --> 01:12:07.426]  I'm going to read that article.
[01:12:07.426 --> 01:12:08.467]  It just came up on Forbes.
[01:12:08.467 --> 01:12:09.568]  I got it up on fullwars.com.
[01:12:09.568 --> 01:12:12.371]  I'm going to see exactly what he's talking about.
[01:12:12.371 --> 01:12:19.978]  That is a guy jumping up and down, running around wild.
[01:12:19.978 --> 01:12:20.919]  I've got to read this.
[01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:22.060]  Guys, print that for me, please.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:22.380]  Thank you.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.743]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[01:12:25.743 --> 01:12:27.505]  But my point is, is that
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.221]  You go now to a bar anywhere.
[01:12:31.221 --> 01:12:32.802]  Oh, let me just swipe your card to get in here.
[01:12:32.802 --> 01:12:35.743]  That's to create metadata on everywhere you go.
[01:12:35.743 --> 01:12:39.345]  It's not enough that they're tracking your cell phone in real time, marking where you went.
[01:12:39.345 --> 01:12:43.707]  It's not enough they're watching you over cameras and watching you over your own home computer.
[01:12:43.707 --> 01:12:44.867]  That's all admitted now.
[01:12:44.867 --> 01:12:45.848]  It's all completely illegal.
[01:12:46.568 --> 01:12:50.892]  Now they're just putting these systems in everywhere to politically dominate it.
[01:12:50.892 --> 01:12:51.613]  Oh!
[01:12:51.613 --> 01:13:06.387]  You know, they've got legislation introduced to have kill switches, which are already in the phones by the way, but have the power to turn everybody's cell phone off in a city, a state, you name it, so they can't communicate while the technocracy takes over, or while the elite get their money out of the banks.
[01:13:06.387 --> 01:13:10.431]  This is a totally one-sided, no checks and balance, nightmare
[01:13:11.718 --> 01:13:22.664]  system that's being built right now so there's that story police blame bar owners for not knowing law after getting caught pushing them into surveillance program police in
[01:13:24.793 --> 01:13:25.574]  How do you say that?
[01:13:25.574 --> 01:13:32.799]  Multnomah County finally suspended a new data mining program this week after local newspaper began questioning its legality.
[01:13:32.799 --> 01:13:39.003]  The last several weeks, police have issued ID scanning devices to clubs and bars all throughout Portland's Old Town neighborhood.
[01:13:39.003 --> 01:13:45.908]  The scanners not only captured customers' personal data, including names and photos, but uploaded all the information to police database.
[01:13:45.908 --> 01:13:48.449]  And when the cops got caught, they went, oh, it's an accident.
[01:13:48.449 --> 01:13:50.811]  It's just meant to check and make sure you're of age.
[01:13:50.811 --> 01:13:51.672]  That's a total bull.
[01:13:52.492 --> 01:13:59.358]  After receiving a three-year alcohol abuse reduction grant, they found out how much you're drinking and gave it to the insurance companies.
[01:13:59.358 --> 01:14:04.103]  They were rewarded $60,000 to obtain the police-run scanners for multiple drinking establishments.
[01:14:04.103 --> 01:14:05.965]  Then, of course, they forced everybody to do it.
[01:14:05.965 --> 01:14:15.674]  Despite Oregon law placing strict limits on storing and sharing information from ID scanners, specifically police were persistent in getting local bars to comply with the program.
[01:14:15.674 --> 01:14:16.534]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:16.534 --> 01:14:17.295]  I love it.
[01:14:17.295 --> 01:14:18.176]  Gotta love it, man.
[01:14:18.925 --> 01:14:20.787]  That's because the cops are compartmentalized, too.
[01:14:20.787 --> 01:14:27.715]  A lot of the cops actually don't like this, so they're, like, trying to enforce that it not get all your data.
[01:14:27.715 --> 01:14:28.716]  You're compartmentalized.
[01:14:28.716 --> 01:14:31.960]  They don't want you knowing all the data's being sent.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.581]  Okay?
[01:14:32.581 --> 01:14:35.784]  The globalists want to just set the precedent for all this.
[01:14:35.784 --> 01:14:38.507]  Belgium socialists get ready to okay child euthanasia.
[01:14:39.255 --> 01:14:43.496]  Children will be required to tell psychologists they understand what euthanasia is.
[01:14:43.496 --> 01:14:51.159]  So now, the state's going to be able to convince your five-year-old they want to die, and then they'll kill you.
[01:14:51.159 --> 01:14:54.760]  And they're going to make the culture ugly enough to where you're going to want to die.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.920]  Monopolizing the internet.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.461]  Comcast gobbles up Time Warner.
[01:14:58.461 --> 01:15:03.222]  Imperium in imperio will govern your internet connection.
[01:15:03.222 --> 01:15:04.763]  There can be only one.
[01:15:04.763 --> 01:15:07.744]  Competition is a sin, said the Robert Barron John D. Rockefeller.
[01:15:08.706 --> 01:15:13.351]  It's Maxim, a rule of conduct for large corporations for well over 100 years.
[01:15:13.351 --> 01:15:17.936]  It'll soon govern how you receive your internet signal and how much you pay for it.
[01:15:17.936 --> 01:15:23.001]  That's right, in many areas of the country you'll only have one internet provider.
[01:15:23.001 --> 01:15:26.065]  The old powerful Comcast, who censored us many times.
[01:15:27.816 --> 01:15:39.045]  Homeland Security to activate nationwide license plate data recognition database and are encouraging police and other citizen spies to take photos of license plates and feed them into Homeland Security's database.
[01:15:39.045 --> 01:15:40.787]  They had this up 20 years ago, folks.
[01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:42.608]  They're just letting the slaves know about it now.
[01:15:42.608 --> 01:15:45.991]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:15:45.991 --> 01:15:48.433]  I'm going to stop right there and go to your phone calls.
[01:15:48.433 --> 01:15:49.374]  Finish your point, sir.
[01:15:49.374 --> 01:15:52.576]  You were bringing up the resolution last week by Congress that was
[01:15:54.019 --> 01:15:55.340]  Yeah, Alex, what this does is
[01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:30.741]  You know, give them the opportunity, or give that nut Obama the opportunity, you know, to use thermonuclear war.
[01:16:30.741 --> 01:16:34.704]  When do Republicans and Democrats agree on anything?
[01:16:34.704 --> 01:16:35.925]  The NDAA.
[01:16:36.765 --> 01:16:42.751]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff where we have so-called bipartisan cooperation.
[01:16:42.751 --> 01:16:44.212]  We don't need that.
[01:16:44.212 --> 01:16:51.539]  Every time they do that, it's future destruction of a liberty or blowing up the world.
[01:16:51.539 --> 01:17:01.948]  The other thing, I want to comment on what you said about Iran, because take a look at the fact that in the United States we have different factions.
[01:17:02.694 --> 01:17:08.496]  Neocons have been beating the war drums for years on Iran.
[01:17:08.496 --> 01:17:14.918]  And I would assume the same thing goes on within the country of Iran.
[01:17:14.918 --> 01:17:18.199]  We have ships off their shores.
[01:17:18.199 --> 01:17:20.540]  Why is that okay?
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:28.283]  But if they say they're going to bring a ship off of our shores, everybody gets excited about it.
[01:17:28.283 --> 01:17:31.844]  You know, this may be just playing to their own domestic
[01:17:32.938 --> 01:17:35.919]  Listen, listen, listen.
[01:17:35.919 --> 01:17:39.801]  Listen, I have really tried to stop an attack on Iran.
[01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:40.862]  And that's on record.
[01:17:40.862 --> 01:17:42.302]  And I want to be clear.
[01:17:42.302 --> 01:17:43.943]  Their Chairman of their Joint Chiefs...
[01:17:45.407 --> 01:17:58.470]  Came out two weeks ago, and I didn't just believe the Israeli papers, I went and looked it up on the Farsi, on the Iranian, and I saw it on English-speaking press TV, and said, you know, they better not start something with us, we got sleeper cells inside their country.
[01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:02.850]  That's just inviting the globalists to stage stuff and then use that against Iran.
[01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:07.971]  And Iran has been putting out promo videos, blowing up Israel, attacking U.S.
[01:18:07.971 --> 01:18:09.152]  interests.
[01:18:09.152 --> 01:18:10.172]  I'm saying the U.S.
[01:18:11.857 --> 01:18:13.058]  The globalists running the U.S.
[01:18:13.058 --> 01:18:20.483]  have been dealt a defeat overthrowing Iran's ally Syria, who's doing nothing, and really being positive and trying to have peace.
[01:18:20.483 --> 01:18:23.305]  They're good guys compared to Iran.
[01:18:23.305 --> 01:18:31.250]  I don't support a lot of what the Mullahs do, and so my issue is they should be de-escalating stuff now that the sanctions are being taken off.
[01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:46.933]  Okay, why say they'll blow us up, why put the videos out, why say they'll attack the aircraft carriers, and all this rhetoric, when the West is going into a, um, conciliatory motion?
[01:18:46.933 --> 01:18:50.393]  Well, you know, it's red meat for their population.
[01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:56.674]  The other thing that, you know... But I don't even agree with that, because most of their population likes the US.
[01:18:56.674 --> 01:18:57.954]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:18:57.954 --> 01:19:00.855]  I think Netanyahu is as nuts as
[01:19:01.758 --> 01:19:03.020]  Obama.
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:08.446]  I think he wants destabilization throughout the entire Middle East.
[01:19:08.446 --> 01:19:09.247]  And we see it.
[01:19:21.542 --> 01:19:27.867]  I don't have any doubt that Netanyahu or his interests do want to destabilize the Middle East.
[01:19:27.867 --> 01:19:31.270]  And I think that's a bad policy to try to destabilize people so you're on top of them.
[01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:32.390]  And that's actually the U.S.
[01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.871]  policy.
[01:19:32.871 --> 01:19:35.373]  Balkanization, breakup, destabilization.
[01:19:35.373 --> 01:19:36.754]  I don't like it.
[01:19:36.754 --> 01:19:38.335]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:19:38.335 --> 01:19:40.537]  Iran's got the same kind of policy Israel does.
[01:19:40.537 --> 01:19:42.538]  That's what I said last week about all this.
[01:19:42.538 --> 01:19:43.239]  And I agree.
[01:19:43.239 --> 01:19:45.701]  They all use it domestically to try to crack down and take liberties.
[01:19:47.674 --> 01:19:51.780]  I mean, if the West attacks Iran, that'll keep the Mullahs in another 20, 50 years.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:52.060]  Maybe 100.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:56.926]  And I just don't like authoritarianism of any stride.
[01:19:56.926 --> 01:19:58.629]  And I just wish we could be friends with Iran.
[01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:59.209]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:20:00.891 --> 01:20:02.252]  Attention gun owners.
[01:20:02.252 --> 01:20:07.055]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[01:20:07.055 --> 01:20:10.777]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[01:20:10.777 --> 01:20:13.138]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.

[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:07.983]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:16.107]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:16.107 --> 01:23:20.629]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:24.451]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:24.591 --> 01:23:30.538]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:33.701]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[01:24:30.453 --> 01:24:31.473]  I was out last Sunday.
[01:24:31.473 --> 01:24:37.916]  4 to 6pm Central Standard Time.
[01:24:37.916 --> 01:24:41.397]  I want to go back to your phone calls, but I've got some really amazing news.
[01:24:42.418 --> 01:24:49.021]  that just came in that's going to tie in to Mark Moreno joining us in the next segment.
[01:24:49.021 --> 01:24:55.744]  Here it is, one in four Americans unaware that Earth circles Sun.
[01:24:55.744 --> 01:25:04.847]  I bet money that Mark Dice could go out in LA and that three out of, I mean, and by the way, he doesn't edit that, except for cutting out the spaces.
[01:25:04.847 --> 01:25:08.409]  He really shows you, you know, that nine out of 10 say put gun owners in camps.
[01:25:10.253 --> 01:25:11.254]  Kill them.
[01:25:11.254 --> 01:25:13.515]  Put anyone who isn't a communist in a camp, kill them.
[01:25:13.515 --> 01:25:15.537]  I mean, this is the Democrats.
[01:25:15.537 --> 01:25:19.199]  The most mindless, dumbest people in America.
[01:25:19.199 --> 01:25:20.440]  And I'm just sorry, it's true.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.563]  I bet in Austin, a trendy area, two out of four won't know the Earth circles the Sun.
[01:25:25.563 --> 01:25:35.530]  But you need to ask it like... We need to sign a petition because the Earth, through the global warming, is causing problems to the Sun orbiting us.
[01:25:37.145 --> 01:25:44.429]  So we need to sign a petition to have a stop global warming because it's changing the sun's orbit of the earth.
[01:25:44.429 --> 01:25:46.890]  And if you ask it like that, I bet three out of four.
[01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:54.434]  If you said, we need to sign a petition to regulate the sun orbiting the earth for Obama, that's how the question would be asked.
[01:25:54.434 --> 01:26:01.297]  I bet three out of four trendies, if you did it in front of like Democratic Party headquarters, I'm not joking, would actually sign the thing.
[01:26:01.297 --> 01:26:02.478]  If you said for Obama,
[01:26:03.564 --> 01:26:06.865]  We need to have taxes to help the sun orbit the earth better.
[01:26:06.865 --> 01:26:08.745]  They will sign.
[01:26:08.745 --> 01:26:10.485]  The key is for Obama.
[01:26:10.485 --> 01:26:13.966]  For Obama, we're going to put all conservatives in slave labor camps.
[01:26:13.966 --> 01:26:16.207]  And we're going to kill them.
[01:26:16.207 --> 01:26:18.227]  And people, in English, go, good.
[01:26:18.227 --> 01:26:18.927]  You see, you want to kill them.
[01:26:18.927 --> 01:26:20.007]  They go, you don't have to tell me, buddy.
[01:26:20.007 --> 01:26:21.328]  I want to kill them.
[01:26:21.328 --> 01:26:22.168]  And they're like, nod.
[01:26:22.168 --> 01:26:23.448]  They go, hmm.
[01:26:23.448 --> 01:26:24.508]  So these are good people.
[01:26:24.508 --> 01:26:26.729]  These are the liberals.
[01:26:26.729 --> 01:26:27.869]  These are the open-minded people.
[01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:33.565]  But it shows some hope that only one out of four doesn't know the Earth orbits the Sun.
[01:26:33.565 --> 01:26:37.132]  I mean, I thought Copernicus, you know, had that figured out.
[01:26:37.132 --> 01:26:39.697]  Let's talk to Art in Nebraska.
[01:26:39.697 --> 01:26:40.418]  You're on the air.
[01:26:40.418 --> 01:26:40.799]  Go ahead.
[01:26:42.452 --> 01:26:44.053]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:26:44.053 --> 01:26:45.955]  I'm doing alright.
[01:26:45.955 --> 01:26:47.936]  I know I want to utilize my time quickly here.
[01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:54.361]  I just want to say that I've recently started waking up and I've been using most of my free time to try and get educated.
[01:26:54.361 --> 01:26:58.724]  I just figured out, like, a week ago that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:26:58.724 --> 01:27:01.646]  It's like, oh my god, you know, that's not cool.
[01:27:01.646 --> 01:27:02.927]  That kind of pisses me off.
[01:27:02.927 --> 01:27:05.288]  Oh no, we kind of got some bad people running things, yeah.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:22.626]  I mean so I'm just trying to get caught up on everything and I'm the type of guy that is very vocal when I get going and on something like for example one of the questions I had for you is do you have any talking tips or where do I start or begin there's so many things to talk about like when I get on talk radio I mean what do I bring up and then number two
[01:27:23.326 --> 01:27:24.427]  What about me?
[01:27:24.427 --> 01:27:25.708]  I'm looking at all this stuff.
[01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:26.869]  I watch your program.
[01:27:26.869 --> 01:27:28.990]  Everything is on the internet.
[01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:31.512]  I mean, am I being stupid?
[01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.033]  What do I need to do there?
[01:27:33.033 --> 01:27:37.616]  And I also wanted to comment that, yeah, the New World Order, they're scared of guns, all right?
[01:27:37.616 --> 01:27:40.117]  Pointed at them, that's the problem.
[01:27:40.117 --> 01:27:45.381]  The two holy grails, the way I see it, is them taking our guns and our internet so they can take our money.
[01:27:45.381 --> 01:27:48.983]  And our privacy so they can then game the whole political system against us.
[01:27:48.983 --> 01:27:49.824]  Well said.
[01:27:49.824 --> 01:27:51.925]  Let me try to give you mine, answer your first question.
[01:27:51.925 --> 01:27:52.426]  It's a big deal.
[01:27:53.266 --> 01:28:17.674]  You can take any topic, national or local talk radio is covering, and cover the topic, give them your take on it, not lie to the screener, and then add to it that, well, yeah, Obama is becoming a dictator, but the problem is the very same offshore special interests that are tax-exempt own the Republicans as well.
[01:28:17.674 --> 01:28:21.776]  So what do we do about monopoly capitalism getting rid of our real capitalist system?
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.981]  You know, that's what you don't cover on Conservative Talk Radio is the other side of it.
[01:28:25.981 --> 01:28:31.522]  That's why we can't get Democrats to join us and get out of this paradigm is because they see the hypocrisy of the Republicans.
[01:28:31.522 --> 01:28:36.543]  So the two hypocritical systems prop each other up because folks think that's the only choice.
[01:28:36.543 --> 01:28:38.023]  You know, that's an example.
[01:28:38.023 --> 01:28:40.664]  Or let's say they're talking about the city going bankrupt.
[01:28:40.664 --> 01:28:44.184]  You call them and say, well, why do we double the cost to treat the water?
[01:28:44.184 --> 01:28:47.245]  When, you know, they've done all this just so that we get bought out by foreign interests.
[01:28:47.245 --> 01:28:48.825]  We need to get the fluoride out of the water.
[01:28:48.825 --> 01:28:49.986]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:28:49.986 --> 01:28:51.466]  Any topic you can hijack.
[01:28:52.984 --> 01:29:02.210]  Now, as for the internet, I think it's good if you have the time and the energy to try to protect your identity from, because there's hackers, there's government people, there's data miners.
[01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:11.355]  Everybody should try to get basic, well-known, certified systems that protect your identity, protect your information, that have good histories of trying to protect their data.
[01:29:11.355 --> 01:29:13.256]  Big box stores, big banks, they're the worst.
[01:29:13.256 --> 01:29:15.097]  Government, it's the worst sieve.
[01:29:15.097 --> 01:29:20.341]  And then the worst things get, they want more of our data and more proof of who we are, which only makes it worse.
[01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:24.543]  So the answer is keep cash in the equation as well.
[01:29:24.543 --> 01:29:28.386]  But at the same time, politically, I wouldn't be scared of them knowing who you are.
[01:29:28.386 --> 01:29:39.093]  I would politically be very open, because we need to show other people that liberty is popular, that freedom should be re-legalized, because good hides in plain sight.
[01:29:39.093 --> 01:29:40.594]  Evil, you know, tries to hide in the dark.
[01:29:40.594 --> 01:29:47.279]  So it's very important that we not be secret agent-esque about what we're doing, but that we be out in the open, because we're the good guys.
[01:29:47.279 --> 01:29:47.939]  We're the leaders.
[01:29:47.939 --> 01:29:48.440]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:49.639 --> 01:29:51.040]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.001]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.001 --> 01:29:53.902]  We'll be right back with them salads.
[01:29:53.902 --> 01:29:57.064]  We're seeing global warming this winter.
[01:29:57.064 --> 01:29:58.946]  And is it true that Obama hung the moon?
[01:30:00.785 --> 01:30:01.826]  The facts are in.
[01:30:01.826 --> 01:30:03.227]  The studies are legion.
[01:30:03.227 --> 01:30:10.732]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:30:10.732 --> 01:30:14.574]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:30:14.574 --> 01:30:15.135]  Simple.
[01:30:15.135 --> 01:30:19.478]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:30:19.858 --> 01:30:25.561]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:30:25.561 --> 01:30:31.104]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:30:31.104 --> 01:30:41.910]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:43.751]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:46.474]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:48.636]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[01:30:58.607 --> 01:30:59.888]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[01:31:00.769 --> 01:31:03.612]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:31:03.612 --> 01:31:08.757]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:31:08.757 --> 01:31:16.865]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:31:16.865 --> 01:31:21.409]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:25.193]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:31:25.353 --> 01:31:31.300]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.463]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:31:34.463 --> 01:31:39.629]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from my Patriot Supply.
[01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:48.016]  BuyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:32:00.405 --> 01:32:05.128]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:32:05.128 --> 01:32:08.250]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:13.814]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:32:13.814 --> 01:32:15.395]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:32:15.735 --> 01:32:17.376]  We are what we eat.
[01:32:17.376 --> 01:32:22.039]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:32:22.039 --> 01:32:26.262]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[01:32:26.262 --> 01:32:28.824]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:32:28.824 --> 01:32:35.048]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:33:27.127 --> 01:33:29.869]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.869 --> 01:33:31.470]  Alex Jones?
[01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:33.612]  Oh my goodness.
[01:33:33.612 --> 01:33:38.176]  Some of those liners are a bit pretentious.
[01:33:38.176 --> 01:33:39.217]  Though I do like that music.
[01:33:43.726 --> 01:33:50.589]  I tell you, we are knocking them dead, the fake global warming crime cartel.
[01:33:50.589 --> 01:33:52.691]  We are totally exposing their fraud.
[01:33:52.691 --> 01:33:57.813]  So, just for them, I want to play a little bit more of this song before we go to the man, Mark Moreno.
[01:33:57.813 --> 01:34:04.797]  Crank it up!
[01:34:04.797 --> 01:34:05.597]  Knock them dead!
[01:34:05.597 --> 01:34:08.819]  We're going to go to Mark in a moment.
[01:34:08.819 --> 01:34:10.599]  It's huge.
[01:34:10.599 --> 01:34:11.380]  And I mean uber.
[01:34:13.089 --> 01:34:19.776]  Gigantic intel that is truly mind-blowing.
[01:34:19.776 --> 01:34:28.226]  Probably some of the craziest stuff he's ever covered here on air with the Great Lakes freezing, record cold all over the Northern Hemisphere, Northern and Southern Arctics growing massively.
[01:34:28.226 --> 01:34:29.607]  Wait till you see what they've done.
[01:34:29.607 --> 01:34:30.308]  They've doubled down.
[01:34:30.308 --> 01:34:30.849]  But briefly,
[01:34:32.102 --> 01:34:38.989]  Mediaite has come out with 13 romantic cable news valentines to share with your loved ones.
[01:34:38.989 --> 01:34:44.635]  And I really like these because I guess I'm number three, Rush Limbaugh's number four.
[01:34:44.635 --> 01:34:50.181]  And it says, my dearest love, many nights do I stay awake thinking about your pleasant
[01:34:50.982 --> 01:35:13.121]  bosom and the globalist scum the nerd police taking over everything and then it's a Spiral of insanity down into it and I do like it when the Democrats and their websites come out with these type of hit pieces Because it's it's fun to be fun to be Included in those it is good.
[01:35:13.121 --> 01:35:16.124]  It is good for some or some humor
[01:35:17.489 --> 01:35:18.830]  By the way, we're going to play this clip later.
[01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:22.333]  You know, Nancy Pelosi says that marriage is not a good thing.
[01:35:22.333 --> 01:35:23.334]  Why would anybody want to get married?
[01:35:25.361 --> 01:35:28.483]  These people really do act like they're Beelzebub or something.
[01:35:28.483 --> 01:35:36.109]  Before I go to our illustrious guest, we have a new t-shirt in that is already becoming one of the bestsellers ever.
[01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:42.234]  I think it should be the bestseller ever, but it's Obama as the Joker, that limited edition, that was the bestseller ever.
[01:35:42.234 --> 01:35:47.879]  So we've brought it back in another limited edition that's about to go out of stock, the Obama Tyrant shirt.
[01:35:47.879 --> 01:35:52.362]  But we now have two different Molon Labe come and take it.
[01:35:52.362 --> 01:35:53.744]  One in the Greek.
[01:35:54.721 --> 01:36:06.367]  That says Molon Labe come and take it with a Greek War Helmet, a Spartan Helmet with two crossed M4s and Victory Reef around it.
[01:36:06.367 --> 01:36:09.448]  I think it's the best looking Molon Labe shirt out there.
[01:36:09.448 --> 01:36:16.132]  It's gray on black and it's kind of a grayish gold on black and then we've also
[01:36:17.586 --> 01:36:23.011]  Also got just an Info Wars with the Molon Labe symbol and the Molon Labe on the back.
[01:36:23.011 --> 01:36:24.612]  So they have images on the front and back.
[01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:26.273]  And it's all made in America.
[01:36:26.273 --> 01:36:28.675]  Part of our Made in 1776 brand.
[01:36:28.675 --> 01:36:30.997]  Madein1776.com.
[01:36:30.997 --> 01:36:36.041]  Go to Madein1776.com and you can find everything made in America.
[01:36:36.041 --> 01:36:38.443]  The ball caps, the golf shirts, all of it.
[01:36:38.443 --> 01:36:40.024]  And yeah, it all cost about 30 to 50% more.
[01:36:42.213 --> 01:36:52.606]  We now have the 1776 Worldwide Bottle Breacher, a .50 caliber shell with the bullet in it, with the powder taken out.
[01:36:52.606 --> 01:36:54.328]  This is made by Navy Seals.
[01:36:55.532 --> 01:36:56.733]  One of them isn't even retired yet.
[01:36:56.733 --> 01:36:58.494]  He gets out next year.
[01:36:58.494 --> 01:37:04.678]  In Dallas, this is actually made by a group of Navy SEALs who are evil entrepreneurs.
[01:37:04.678 --> 01:37:09.161]  And I was talking to a guy I know that buys these and they did a custom print for us that says made in 1776.
[01:37:09.161 --> 01:37:13.104]  It actually says 1776 worldwide on it.
[01:37:13.104 --> 01:37:17.347]  And so it actually, portions of it end up through the Navy SEALs going to real veterans groups.
[01:37:17.347 --> 01:37:19.969]  But you're hiring former Navy SEALs.
[01:37:19.969 --> 01:37:20.709]  Navy SEAL owns them.
[01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:22.831]  It's the Navy SEALs that work there.
[01:37:22.831 --> 01:37:23.491]  Navy people.
[01:37:23.491 --> 01:37:24.392]  It's not just Navy SEALs.
[01:37:24.952 --> 01:37:26.412]  That's run by Navy SEALs.
[01:37:26.412 --> 01:37:29.433]  And so we're now, they've made these custom bullets for us.
[01:37:29.433 --> 01:37:30.793]  They reached out to us.
[01:37:30.793 --> 01:37:32.514]  And it's a bottle breacher.
[01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:34.854]  And I've got mine at home and everybody loves it.
[01:37:34.854 --> 01:37:36.895]  People come over for a barbecue or whatever.
[01:37:36.895 --> 01:37:42.316]  It is awesome and a great gift for friends and family in the military especially.
[01:37:42.316 --> 01:37:45.897]  So again, made by Navy SEALs for patriots everywhere.
[01:37:45.897 --> 01:37:49.778]  All of that is made in the USA at MadeIn1776.com.
[01:37:49.778 --> 01:37:52.139]  The other apparel and stuff's made in Mexico, you name it.
[01:37:52.139 --> 01:37:52.779]  Nothing against that.
[01:37:53.399 --> 01:37:57.781]  It's just that, you know, you want to pay a third less or half off, we just give you the choice right there.
[01:37:57.781 --> 01:38:09.485]  But everything at MadeIn1776.com or on the 1776 section of InfowarsStore.com, the brass belt buckles with George Washington on it, it's like showing a vampire of the sun at high noon when they see this stuff.
[01:38:09.485 --> 01:38:13.286]  I mean, it's all right there at MadeIn1776.com.
[01:38:13.286 --> 01:38:16.747]  Very inexpensive and affordable compared to other American-made clothes.
[01:38:16.747 --> 01:38:19.568]  You try to buy a golf shirt like this at Dillard's, it's like $80 to $100.
[01:38:21.889 --> 01:38:23.291]  And it's not made in America.
[01:38:23.291 --> 01:38:24.373]  This is made in America.
[01:38:24.373 --> 01:38:24.393]  $49.95.
[01:38:24.393 --> 01:38:27.838]  And I'll just be honest with you.
[01:38:27.838 --> 01:38:29.561]  They were correcting me the other day.
[01:38:29.561 --> 01:38:32.446]  It costs us 20-something bucks to print that shirt, to get that shirt.
[01:38:32.446 --> 01:38:34.288]  20, and that's a lot.
[01:38:34.288 --> 01:38:36.272]  I mean, I could buy a shirt like that from China for $6.
[01:38:37.566 --> 01:38:38.587]  But it lasts a lot longer.
[01:38:38.587 --> 01:38:39.648]  Everybody compliments it.
[01:38:39.648 --> 01:38:42.149]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:44.711]  And then lastly, the Super Mel Vitality.
[01:38:44.711 --> 01:38:45.772]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[01:38:45.772 --> 01:38:51.576]  We just took eight of the best known herbs, organic, concentrated them with Dr. Group in his factory, his laboratory, put it out.
[01:38:51.576 --> 01:38:55.839]  We have the only nascent iodine of this type, the fluoride shield, the survival shield.
[01:38:55.839 --> 01:38:56.760]  Super Mel Vitality.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:00.402]  It's all available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:00.402 --> 01:39:02.284]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:02.884 --> 01:39:04.185]  We're good to go.
[01:39:29.105 --> 01:39:37.509]  We've been waiting on an herb that finally got in from the Himalayas that's totally organic so we can finally go to production but we've been waiting months to get it.
[01:39:37.509 --> 01:39:42.092]  But the thing is you need to order now if you want to get it immediately and then believe me you've heard the reviews.
[01:39:42.092 --> 01:39:48.235]  Just try our products and I know you're going to like them and if you don't you've supported the broadcast but I've heard no negative feedback.
[01:39:48.235 --> 01:39:52.957]  So 888-253-3139 and as always I want to thank all of you for your support.
[01:39:55.762 --> 01:40:09.833]  This is a big deal, folks, because you've got Al Gore saying in 2007, 2009, in countless speeches, that by the winter and the summer of 2013, we would see a completely melted northern ice cap.
[01:40:10.543 --> 01:40:19.390]  Well, it grew at record numbers, and Mark Moreno is the master and advises Congress, and has all the scientists that he researches with on his site, ClimateDepot.com.
[01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:25.475]  He has all the actual numbers, but just in a general sense, Southern Pole getting bigger, Northern Pole getting bigger.
[01:40:25.475 --> 01:40:28.218]  They always point in the summer at it shrinking with the satellite.
[01:40:28.218 --> 01:40:29.358]  They always shrink.
[01:40:29.358 --> 01:40:34.683]  That's why the Vikings talked about a northern passage into Russia, you know, in writings a thousand years old, as old as Beowulf.
[01:40:35.694 --> 01:40:40.416]  But they use the public's ignorance and say polar bears can't swim, penguins can't swim.
[01:40:40.416 --> 01:40:44.617]  They talk about penguins are going to drown at the North Pole, that there are no penguins at the North Pole.
[01:40:44.617 --> 01:40:47.218]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff we've seen and covered.
[01:40:47.218 --> 01:40:49.979]  Al Gore and all his lies that have been proven in court in England.
[01:40:49.979 --> 01:40:54.360]  They can't show school kids his film in England because it's been proven to be a fraud.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.081]  They have like 65 lies, I think, proven in court, or was it 63?
[01:40:57.081 --> 01:40:57.341]  I forget.
[01:41:00.302 --> 01:41:01.843]  Now they're all over the news.
[01:41:01.843 --> 01:41:03.424]  National Geographic just came in the mail.
[01:41:03.424 --> 01:41:04.465]  I've been taking it since I was a kid.
[01:41:04.465 --> 01:41:06.125]  My grandmother still gives it to me.
[01:41:06.125 --> 01:41:07.486]  God bless her soul.
[01:41:07.486 --> 01:41:07.987]  One of them died.
[01:41:07.987 --> 01:41:12.929]  They used to both give it to me, but the point is one of them still gives it to me, the one that's alive.
[01:41:12.929 --> 01:41:17.932]  It said we're going to be flooded and dead next year and that the cold is all caused by this.
[01:41:17.932 --> 01:41:20.374]  CBS News is now reporting with a
[01:41:21.926 --> 01:41:25.230]  It's beyond a quack, and that's what Mark's here to tell us about.
[01:41:25.230 --> 01:41:32.998]  The most incredible thing ever, that this record cold temp and the Great Lakes freezing is a heat wave.
[01:41:32.998 --> 01:41:34.579]  So up is down, down is up.
[01:41:34.579 --> 01:41:38.604]  Raising the debt ceiling will not raise your debt.
[01:41:38.604 --> 01:41:41.327]  You can keep your doctor, your premium will go down, not up.
[01:41:42.628 --> 01:41:43.909]  I did not have sex with that lady.
[01:41:43.909 --> 01:41:45.691]  I mean, the level of lying here.
[01:41:45.691 --> 01:41:50.295]  So to break this down is Mark Moreno of ClimateDepot.com.
[01:41:50.295 --> 01:41:57.182]  Mark, this is simply amazing and it ties in to a piece of news I'm going to go to in a moment after you've had a chance to break things down.
[01:41:57.182 --> 01:41:59.063]  But thank you for joining us, sir.
[01:41:59.063 --> 01:41:59.904]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:41:59.904 --> 01:42:00.545]  Happy to be here.
[01:42:01.238 --> 01:42:10.422]  Yes, Al Gore made all sorts of predictions about the Arctic, about Antarctica, the United Nations is on record about global sea ice.
[01:42:10.422 --> 01:42:23.508]  We are now well above average for global sea ice, and in fact we've had, depending on what month and what you look at at Earth, we've had more ice in general than we've had probably in the last 20 or 25 years, and it's on an increasing trend.
[01:42:23.508 --> 01:42:24.168]  Antarctica
[01:42:26.207 --> 01:42:37.830]  The South Pole has been at or near an exceeded record extent for the last several years, and this year it's breaking all-time records, the highest they've ever had since satellite monitoring began.
[01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:46.592]  In the Arctic, we had an incredible year-to-year, the largest year-to-year recovery of Arctic ice, and the Arctic has diminished some since the late 1970s, but think back.
[01:42:47.152 --> 01:42:50.014]  When did we start monitoring Arctic ice with satellites?
[01:42:50.014 --> 01:42:54.017]  At the end of the 40-year global cooling scare, the coming ice age scare.
[01:42:54.017 --> 01:43:09.146]  So yes, Arctic has lost ice since that period, but there's indications this year that the older, thicker ice is now being wedged and that it's not going to lose anything significant or near record like Al Gore and others are predicting.
[01:43:09.146 --> 01:43:16.151]  But both poles had a record year in their own ways, and now global sea ice is doing well above average.
[01:43:16.781 --> 01:43:24.764]  But what's most shocking is when we have heatwaves, and be they in Moscow, be they in Australia, no matter where they are, that's blamed on man-made global warming.
[01:43:24.764 --> 01:43:42.370]  When we now have record cold, instead of just saying, well, that's an exception, the global warming activists, including Al Gore, who now says it's consistent, are blaming, quote, excess heat in the atmosphere for destabilizing the Arctic air mass and essentially making the jet stream dive down with the polar vortex.
[01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:44.771]  They come up with all these convoluted explanations
[01:43:45.735 --> 01:43:50.438]  And now, everything, every weather event is consistent with man-made global warming.
[01:43:50.438 --> 01:43:51.278]  But it gets better.
[01:43:51.278 --> 01:43:55.320]  Up on your site, you looked up who the CBS expert is.
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:00.443]  They might as well have gotten Johnny Carson as the Great Carnac.
[01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:02.324]  Yes, this is an amazing story.
[01:44:02.324 --> 01:44:04.325]  It's a Climate Depot exclusive.
[01:44:04.325 --> 01:44:07.607]  Just posted this this morning, actually about two hours ago.
[01:44:08.729 --> 01:44:23.679]  The CBS expert on CBS this morning, that they had on to explain how global warming is causing record cold and snow, was a New York City College physicist named Michio Kaku.
[01:44:23.679 --> 01:44:35.687]  And Michio Kaku was only identified as a professor on this show, and he claimed that the excess heat in the Arctic was against intuition, essentially causing all of this record cold and heat.
[01:44:35.687 --> 01:44:38.349]  Now, before we even knew, and I'll get to what he is in a moment,
[01:44:38.969 --> 01:44:43.053]  Scientists were trashing CBS News for featuring this guy's views.
[01:44:43.053 --> 01:44:44.854]  In fact, Ph.D.
[01:44:44.854 --> 01:44:52.441]  meteorologist Ryan Mao of the Weather Bell said that, and he quote, no effing clue what Michio is talking about.
[01:44:52.441 --> 01:44:53.402]  And these are in quotes.
[01:44:53.402 --> 01:44:56.985]  I'm quoting, he called it a festering wound on the field of meteorology.
[01:44:56.985 --> 01:45:02.490]  These are what his colleagues, what even his colleagues, this man, you know, a physicist who doesn't even really study the weather,
[01:45:03.166 --> 01:45:04.948]  These are what his colleagues called him.
[01:45:04.948 --> 01:45:06.090]  It was a festering wound.
[01:45:06.090 --> 01:45:13.578]  This is before we found out that this is a paranormal guru, if you will.
[01:45:13.578 --> 01:45:14.679]  Michio Kuku.
[01:45:14.679 --> 01:45:18.284]  I said Kuku by accident or Freudian slip.
[01:45:18.284 --> 01:45:18.684]  I'm not sure.
[01:45:18.684 --> 01:45:19.285]  But Keku.
[01:45:20.251 --> 01:45:41.881]  Um, was featured by CBS, and he promotes things like telepathy, telekinesis, mind reading, and, uh, on his website, and this is all part of what some people would call magic, mentalism, uh, telepathy is where you sort of communicate without using any of those... So what you're saying, you've always said it's based on voodoo, and now they're officially doing it.
[01:45:43.175 --> 01:45:49.959]  And telekinesis is the alleged psychic ability allowing a person to influence a physical system without physical interaction.
[01:45:49.959 --> 01:45:55.703]  In other words, it's a fancy way of sort of mind-altering, a way of looking at things.
[01:45:55.703 --> 01:45:56.363]  Now, it goes on.
[01:45:56.363 --> 01:45:57.944]  He has a whole book on this.
[01:45:57.944 --> 01:45:58.605]  He's been featured.
[01:45:58.605 --> 01:46:02.987]  He actually went on and let Stephen Colbert make fun of him on The Daily Show or whatever.
[01:46:02.987 --> 01:46:05.269]  That's The Daily Show, but whatever Stephen Colbert's show is.
[01:46:06.434 --> 01:46:09.676]  And this man, his book is called The Future of the Mind.
[01:46:09.676 --> 01:46:20.583]  He's claiming that feats such as photographing dreams, uploading memories, mentally controlled robots, and telekinesis have already been achieved.
[01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:27.467]  And he goes further and says we're going to have a complete map of the brain and scientists are going to be able to send our consciousness throughout the universe.
[01:46:27.467 --> 01:46:33.051]  So the point is he is not a meteorologist and CBS knew that but never thought to mention it.
[01:46:33.917 --> 01:46:34.197]  No.
[01:46:34.197 --> 01:46:39.461]  In fact, they couldn't pick a more extreme outlier, A, on the science of global warming.
[01:46:39.461 --> 01:46:46.687]  His comments were just, again, deemed as no effing clue by another meteorologist.
[01:46:46.687 --> 01:46:51.551]  And the fact that this is a man into, like, essentially mentalism.
[01:46:51.551 --> 01:46:59.557]  This is a guy who belongs on a Las Vegas stage performance, not someone who should be consulted as a weather expert.
[01:46:59.557 --> 01:47:02.319]  And this is interesting to see what CBS News does about this because
[01:47:03.339 --> 01:47:15.746]  They won't feature any skeptical scientists, and if they do, if some skeptical scientist got a $200, you know, fee 25 years ago by some fossil fuel industry, they'll say he's discredited and no one can talk to him.
[01:47:15.746 --> 01:47:24.810]  But someone else comes on and promotes telepathy and telekinesis, mind reading, and they're portrayed as the esteemed expert by CBS News.
[01:47:24.810 --> 01:47:25.951]  By the way, it's the same network.
[01:47:26.592 --> 01:47:33.713]  Where Scott Pelley is actually on record, the current PBS News anchor is on record when he was with 60 Minutes a few years back, 2007 I believe.
[01:47:34.667 --> 01:47:42.270]  He's saying that he would not interview any global warming skeptical scientist for the same reason he wouldn't interview anyone who is skeptical of the Holocaust.
[01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:51.874]  In other words, they're making direct comparisons of the Holocaust and they will not interview them.
[01:47:51.874 --> 01:47:58.336]  So this is an amazing thing to see CBS promoting a mind-reading expert as a climate expert.
[01:47:58.547 --> 01:48:00.931]  Well, let me ask you this question.
[01:48:00.931 --> 01:48:05.377]  We know almost all the scientists, the 2000 they claimed it signed on, unanimous.
[01:48:05.377 --> 01:48:10.665]  Al Gore said back in 2006, there's no carbon tax, no plan for that.
[01:48:10.665 --> 01:48:11.927]  It's unanimous.
[01:48:11.927 --> 01:48:13.770]  Congress, all scientists agree.
[01:48:14.911 --> 01:48:19.593]  Uh, that, uh, man-made global warming is, is real, and that we've got to do something.
[01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:21.693]  And then I have the clips, it's in my film, Endgame.
[01:48:21.693 --> 01:48:24.474]  The congressmen are like, well, wait, there are a bunch of scientists that don't agree.
[01:48:24.474 --> 01:48:28.656]  And he goes, no, only ones that believe we didn't land on the moon and blah, blah, blah.
[01:48:28.656 --> 01:48:30.816]  Well, they've got Professor Cuckoo over there.
[01:48:30.816 --> 01:48:31.817]  I mean, Michael...
[01:48:33.118 --> 01:48:34.919]  I'm sorry, me too, I got that confused.
[01:48:34.919 --> 01:48:36.040]  It's like Obama, Osama.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:41.064]  The point is, you've got Professor Akoo, or whatever his name is, over there.
[01:48:41.064 --> 01:48:55.596]  If they've got all these thousands of scientists, which it turned out almost none of them had actually signed on, they had just been put on the list, or been agreed to be sent UN material, so they were put on there fraudulently, that's a whole other controversy you've covered and Lord Monckton have covered in great detail.
[01:48:55.596 --> 01:48:58.339]  But if they've got all these great meteorologists and all these great
[01:48:58.979 --> 01:49:07.269]  Planetologists, basically, who are ready to come on and say it's so real, why'd they have to get a goblin chaser?
[01:49:07.269 --> 01:49:13.978]  And that's the question, and that's what's fascinating about this is they're, what they're doing is they're pushing the new narrative, and the new narrative...
[01:49:14.933 --> 01:49:17.775]  ...is described by the New York Times as global weirding.
[01:49:17.775 --> 01:49:24.819]  And because this is relatively new in the global warming debate, it's only the last, maybe, year that it's really taken on a full head of steam.
[01:49:24.819 --> 01:49:26.781]  It's only been around a few years before that.
[01:49:26.781 --> 01:49:31.123]  The idea is we used to talk about unprecedented temperature rise, allegedly.
[01:49:31.123 --> 01:49:35.486]  And they would talk about the global temperature, the Earth has a fever, they use Al Gore's phrase.
[01:49:35.486 --> 01:49:39.449]  When that failed, and we're going on 17 plus years, actually, Lord Monson had a new analysis out.
[01:49:39.449 --> 01:49:39.929]  It's like 17 years, 5 months.
[01:49:41.830 --> 01:49:45.932]  With no global warming and has actually been slight global cooling since 2002.
[01:49:45.932 --> 01:49:52.396]  Alex, it's so bad that every high school kid today has never experienced global warming in their lifetime.
[01:49:52.396 --> 01:50:01.140]  And you can go a step further now and say that every elementary school kid has only experienced a slight global cooling in their lifetime.
[01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:04.002]  So when you're faced with that as a PR disaster,
[01:50:04.702 --> 01:50:06.083]  You've got to change the narrative.
[01:50:06.083 --> 01:50:12.346]  So the new narrative is every weather event, be it record cold, snow, weather, is all part of global warming.
[01:50:12.346 --> 01:50:22.831]  And in order to push that, you've got to get Las Vegas show acts like Professor Kaku and people who do mentalism and mind reading and all sorts of things like that.
[01:50:23.371 --> 01:50:26.313]  Because you're not going to find a legitimate scientist coming around yet.
[01:50:26.313 --> 01:50:32.676]  You will get more legitimate scientists saying, global warming scientists saying things like, well, it's consistent with, and other things.
[01:50:32.676 --> 01:50:38.440]  But, you know, in order to push the envelope, you've got to reach beyond the known world, if you catch my drift.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:45.624]  Sure, do you think Professor... Do you think Professor, um, Kuku, or what's his name again?
[01:50:45.624 --> 01:50:46.364]  Keku.
[01:50:46.364 --> 01:50:47.425]  No, I'm serious, I can't remember.
[01:50:47.425 --> 01:50:50.567]  Do you think Professor Keku would come on and talk about the Loch Ness Monster with me?
[01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:52.871]  You ought to have him on.
[01:50:52.871 --> 01:50:54.472]  He seems to like the media.
[01:50:54.472 --> 01:50:56.153]  He seems to be very good humored.
[01:50:56.153 --> 01:50:57.714]  Again, he went out with Stephen Colbert.
[01:50:57.714 --> 01:50:59.835]  Maybe I should get you on with him for a debate.
[01:50:59.835 --> 01:51:00.516]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:51:00.516 --> 01:51:04.739]  When you need it the most, will your generator power equipment or vehicle be ready?
[01:51:04.739 --> 01:51:07.320]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:12.144]  And more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:51:12.144 --> 01:51:16.226]  PRI fuel stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:51:16.226 --> 01:51:18.808]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers,
[01:51:19.048 --> 01:51:22.310]  And ships at sea rely on PRI fuel stabilizers.
[01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:23.351]  And you can, too.
[01:51:23.351 --> 01:51:25.132]  Call 888-776-9373.

[01:51:30.415 --> 01:51:33.457]  It's time to kick some ash.
[01:51:33.457 --> 01:51:35.978]  Because cigarettes have met their match.
[01:51:35.978 --> 01:51:38.560]  Smokers are switching to Vapriate e-liquid by Le Cyg.
[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:42.304]  Because when you kick ash, you kick tar and smelly smoke, too.
[01:51:42.304 --> 01:51:46.047]  Lecig smokes the competition with real people customer service.

[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.700]  Kick some ash.
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:01.141]  The facts are in.
[01:52:01.141 --> 01:52:02.542]  The studies are legion.
[01:52:02.542 --> 01:52:10.066]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:52:10.066 --> 01:52:13.888]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:52:13.888 --> 01:52:14.449]  Simple.
[01:52:14.449 --> 01:52:19.192]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:52:19.192 --> 01:52:24.615]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:52:24.895 --> 01:52:30.419]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:52:30.419 --> 01:52:41.227]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:52:41.227 --> 01:52:43.048]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:52:43.208 --> 01:52:45.789]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.

[01:53:03.897 --> 01:53:17.426]  From 1946 to 1989, during a period known as the Cold War, the enemies of freedom sent teams into their own citizens' homes in order to place listening devices and cameras.
[01:53:17.426 --> 01:53:24.710]  They tracked the movements and personal relationships of anyone they could in order to preserve the power of the state.
[01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:30.254]  25 years later, you carry a tracking beacon with you and bug your own homes with your cell phone.
[01:53:30.254 --> 01:53:31.935]  History is repeating itself.

[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.801]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:54:08.801 --> 01:54:17.947]  Final segment with Mark Moreno and then we're working out some technical stuff for video Skype to get the lead singer of Korn on to talk about all things New World Order, Obama, and more.
[01:54:17.947 --> 01:54:19.348]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:54:19.348 --> 01:54:26.432]  There are real environmental issues and real concerns I have, but giving total power over to the kleptocrats to run everything
[01:54:27.771 --> 01:54:33.713]  In the name of them being savers of the Earth and buying carbon credits from Al Gore and Obama is a fraud.
[01:54:33.713 --> 01:54:35.594]  And here's an article out of Breitbart today.
[01:54:35.594 --> 01:54:38.235]  It's actually from AFP, French news agency.
[01:54:38.235 --> 01:54:39.495]  Breitbart carried it.
[01:54:39.495 --> 01:54:47.038]  One in four Americans unaware that Earth circles the Sun in a new study conducted by the National Science Foundation.
[01:54:48.639 --> 01:54:52.086]  And an average of 6.5 got it correctly.
[01:54:52.086 --> 01:54:56.434]  Just 74% of respondents knew that Earth revolved around the Sun.
[01:54:56.434 --> 01:54:57.556]  And here's the problem.
[01:54:58.379 --> 01:55:07.221]  And I'm not trying to be mean, I'm not saying Republicans are super smart on average, but compared to Democrats, it's like a human compared to a rat or something.
[01:55:07.221 --> 01:55:09.321]  Or I guess rats are kind of smart, that's insulting to rats.
[01:55:09.321 --> 01:55:13.682]  Mark, in closing, the only way they can get away with this is total scientific ignorance.
[01:55:13.682 --> 01:55:15.362]  So now we know why they want to dumb people down.
[01:55:15.362 --> 01:55:19.963]  So what do you make of this one in four, not knowing that the Earth circles the Sun?
[01:55:19.963 --> 01:55:21.484]  I think it's the other way around.
[01:55:21.484 --> 01:55:22.484]  What do we do about this?
[01:55:23.044 --> 01:55:24.166]  What do you expect them to do now?
[01:55:24.166 --> 01:55:26.650]  Because they're not stopping, they're just going forward.
[01:55:26.650 --> 01:55:29.294]  Obama's announced he's going to do environmental takeover.
[01:55:29.294 --> 01:55:30.456]  Without Congress, what do we do?
[01:55:31.574 --> 01:55:37.299]  And also, Obama, the billion-dollar slush fund they're starting today, they announced today.
[01:55:37.299 --> 01:55:57.234]  When you mentioned the education here, that poll you just cited, if you go into classrooms now and you talk to the psychiatrists, the anxiety among young people about eco-fares and eco-doom, they know more about the fear of oceans overrunning their homes than they do about whether the earth rotates around the sun or not.
[01:55:57.234 --> 01:55:57.955]  And this is a
[01:55:59.309 --> 01:56:00.570]  This is the core of what's going on.
[01:56:00.570 --> 01:56:11.377]  They're being propagandized from a very young age with all the wrong things, be it through our Hollywood culture, through the textbooks on a lot of these politically scientific things, especially when it comes to global warming.
[01:56:11.377 --> 01:56:16.261]  And so now when they ask them other basic scientific questions, of course they're ignorant, because their heads have no more room.
[01:56:16.261 --> 01:56:21.004]  They've crammed it with so much junk, particularly when it comes to global warming.
[01:56:21.004 --> 01:56:23.326]  Today, in fact, John Holdren
[01:56:23.946 --> 01:56:32.936]  One of your favorites, Obama's science star, came out and announced, quote, weather practically everywhere is being caused by climate change, unquote.
[01:56:32.936 --> 01:56:40.284]  In other words, every weather event that happens is now created by mankind, influenced heavily by mankind.
[01:56:40.284 --> 01:56:41.466]  This is what John Holdren said.
[01:56:42.106 --> 01:56:49.092]  Interestingly enough, he was immediately, just like Professor Keku, the mystic on CBS News, was essentially slammed.
[01:56:49.092 --> 01:56:52.275]  He's being slammed by scientists now.
[01:56:52.275 --> 01:56:55.118]  Holdren claimed that global climate change is increasing drought.
[01:56:55.865 --> 01:57:01.249]  Actual study from the Obama administration, droughts have become shorter, less frequent in smaller parts of the U.S.
[01:57:01.249 --> 01:57:02.410]  over the last century.
[01:57:02.410 --> 01:57:05.472]  Holdren is defying his own government's science.
[01:57:05.472 --> 01:57:08.735]  He's giving out 100% wrong information.
[01:57:08.735 --> 01:57:09.856]  That's the story today.
[01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:16.461]  Not that school kids are getting basic science wrong, but that Obama's science advisor is failing basic science.
[01:57:17.402 --> 01:57:21.386]  Of what he's tasked to be an expert in, global warming.
[01:57:21.386 --> 01:57:34.780]  This man is failing, and on my website today, Climate Depot, Roger Pilkey Jr., a professor, extreme weather expert, takes down John Holdren for this utter drivel that he's promoting today, unchallenged by the way, in the media.
[01:57:35.273 --> 01:57:38.875]  By the way, Mark, I know you've got to go advise Congress and go on national TV in a minute.
[01:57:38.875 --> 01:57:39.915]  You've got to leave.
[01:57:39.915 --> 01:57:44.777]  But anybody you advise us that you think we should get on to break down the science, I'd love to have them on.
[01:57:44.777 --> 01:57:47.318]  But we're winning the political battle.
[01:57:47.318 --> 01:57:49.639]  In closing, as I said, they don't care.
[01:57:49.639 --> 01:57:51.260]  They're just rolling forward.
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:52.181]  What do we do?
[01:57:52.181 --> 01:57:57.943]  Because they use this to power grab any jurisdiction they want, saying climate's changing everywhere.
[01:57:57.943 --> 01:57:59.344]  Well, of course climate's changing.
[01:57:59.344 --> 01:58:00.424]  It's always changing.
[01:58:00.424 --> 01:58:01.885]  What do we do to beat them in a nutshell?
[01:58:02.677 --> 01:58:03.478]  Well, here's two things.
[01:58:03.478 --> 01:58:09.061]  First of all, had Mitt Romney won, Mitt Romney, if you've noticed, people would say, well, vote a new president.
[01:58:09.061 --> 01:58:14.404]  Well, Mitt Romney just came out about a week ago and announced that he's back on the global warming bandwagon.
[01:58:14.404 --> 01:58:19.007]  Remember when he ran, he was a global warming believer, then he got all the pressure, then he backed down?
[01:58:19.007 --> 01:58:21.449]  Well, now he's back, but he doesn't have the pressure for office.
[01:58:21.989 --> 01:58:24.190]  So Republicans aren't the answer.
[01:58:24.190 --> 01:58:29.132]  And Mitt Romney actually said that he would not have stopped Obama's EPA from doing what Obama's about to do.
[01:58:29.132 --> 01:58:31.333]  So I don't know that the Republican Party is capable.
[01:58:31.333 --> 01:58:36.375]  The biggest thing we have to do is try to get the GOP Congress to defund the EPA.
[01:58:36.375 --> 01:58:40.676]  Because President Obama, as the old expression goes, doesn't need no stinking Congress.
[01:58:40.676 --> 01:58:41.096]  That's right.
[01:58:41.096 --> 01:58:42.137]  Great job, Martin Moreno.
[01:58:42.137 --> 01:58:43.077]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:58:43.077 --> 01:58:44.278]  Thank you.
[01:58:44.278 --> 01:58:47.439]  Next hour coming up, folks, I'll finish up with some topics on solutions as well.
[01:58:50.759 --> 01:59:01.453]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:59:01.453 --> 01:59:03.516]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:59:03.516 --> 01:59:04.397]  Fluoride!
[01:59:04.397 --> 01:59:06.139]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:59:06.139 --> 01:59:06.219]  In 1924,
[01:59:07.441 --> 01:59:12.882]  The federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:59:12.882 --> 01:59:17.803]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:59:17.803 --> 01:59:24.125]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:59:24.125 --> 01:59:26.546]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:59:26.546 --> 01:59:29.466]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:59:29.466 --> 01:59:32.847]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:59:32.987 --> 01:59:38.050]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:38.050 --> 01:59:43.512]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:10.556]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.556 --> 02:00:12.158]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.158 --> 02:00:13.699]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.699 --> 02:00:17.903]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.903 --> 02:00:21.968]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:37.651]  U.S.
[02:00:37.651 --> 02:00:41.836]  Army builds fake city in Virginia to practice military occupation.
[02:00:41.836 --> 02:00:43.658]  That story's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:00:43.658 --> 02:00:46.302]  It's the middle column of DrudgeReport.com as well.
[02:00:46.302 --> 02:00:47.443]  Martial law training.
[02:00:47.443 --> 02:00:52.509]  300-acre town includes sports stadium, school, underground subway.
[02:00:53.513 --> 02:00:53.893]  The U.S.
[02:00:53.893 --> 02:01:02.039]  Army has built a 300-acre fake city, complete with sports stadiums, school, and an underground subway in order to train for unspecified future combat scenarios.
[02:01:02.039 --> 02:01:09.885]  The recently opened site is located in Virginia and was built at a cost of $96 million, taking just two years to complete.
[02:01:09.885 --> 02:01:11.826]  While the city was ostensibly built to prepare U.S.
[02:01:11.826 --> 02:01:16.830]  troops for occupation of cities abroad, some will undoubtedly fear the real intention will be closer to home.
[02:01:16.830 --> 02:01:19.212]  Although the site includes a mosque, the town looks
[02:01:19.972 --> 02:01:23.874]  Like an American sitting in every other way with the signs in English.
[02:01:23.874 --> 02:01:30.417]  The fact that Telegraph reports the subway carriages even carry the same logo as the carriages in Washington, D.C.
[02:01:30.417 --> 02:01:35.139]  could suggest the site was built to both double as a foreign city and as a mock domestic town.
[02:01:35.139 --> 02:01:37.440]  The whole military's training is their main mission, domestic, so...
[02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:50.088]  And their enemy being the Tea Party, so... According to Colonel John P. Petkosky, this is the place where we can create, where we can come up with solutions for problems we don't know we have yet.
[02:01:50.088 --> 02:02:02.117]  This is where we'll look at solutions for the future, material solutions and non-material solutions, anything from how you're going to operate in a subterranean environment to how you dismount a Humvee to avoid IED strike.
[02:02:03.041 --> 02:02:10.805]  The increasing demonization of domestic political groups as extremists has prompted numerous scenarios where commentators have suggested the U.S.
[02:02:10.805 --> 02:02:14.387]  Army and National Guard personnel could be needed to quell civil unrest.
[02:02:14.387 --> 02:02:17.968]  This is a very, quote, fairly written article by Paul.
[02:02:17.968 --> 02:02:21.530]  I'm not criticizing our writer, but to the point of almost absconding with the truth.
[02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:27.033]  This is all for domestic operations with a separate dual training operation internationally.
[02:02:27.033 --> 02:02:28.794]  The whole thing is geared up for us domestically.
[02:02:28.794 --> 02:02:30.775]  The bullets, the training, the manuals, the
[02:02:32.179 --> 02:02:41.125]  That's official National Guard announcements, quote, preparing to crush a Tea Party rebellion and the gun owners are going to attack and all this.
[02:02:41.125 --> 02:02:51.332]  In a 2012 academic study about the future use of military as a peacekeeping force within the United States, written by a retired Army colonel, depicted a shocking scenario in which U.S.
[02:02:51.332 --> 02:02:56.476]  Army is used to restore order in a town that's been seized by Tea Party insurrectionists, close quote.
[02:02:57.256 --> 02:02:58.817]  Study dovetailed a leaked U.S.
[02:02:58.817 --> 02:03:10.207]  Army manual which revealed plans for the military to carry out civil disturbance operations, including confiscating firearms, quelling riots, mass civil unrest, and quote, how we would be re-educated.
[02:03:10.207 --> 02:03:11.488]  This is on the Army's website, folks.
[02:03:11.488 --> 02:03:12.569]  I'm not making this up.
[02:03:12.569 --> 02:03:14.190]  They even used the Soviet term.
[02:03:14.190 --> 02:03:14.951]  So it's a good article.
[02:03:14.951 --> 02:03:16.252]  He gets into all the meat at the end.
[02:03:16.252 --> 02:03:18.314]  And I guess it's very journalistic.
[02:03:18.314 --> 02:03:21.957]  He writes it as if it could be two different things.
[02:03:21.957 --> 02:03:23.318]  But we know what it is.
[02:03:23.318 --> 02:03:24.339]  So at a certain point,
[02:03:25.812 --> 02:03:43.512]  It's like there's this modern journalistic thing where you don't say you know, it's like a red fire engine pulls up and you go, the fireman claimed it was a red Ford fire truck they were driving and it said Ford on it and it was red and it had chrome all over it and there was a Dalmatian sitting in the back.
[02:03:43.512 --> 02:03:46.876]  Then I watched it turn on its sirens and drive down the road and spray water on stuff.
[02:03:49.468 --> 02:03:53.011]  I mean, it's just Army, Times, everything, 24-7.
[02:03:53.011 --> 02:03:54.192]  Yes, Brigade Homeland!
[02:03:54.192 --> 02:03:55.313]  Yeah, we're going to take your guns!
[02:03:55.313 --> 02:03:58.676]  You know, and they confiscated guns in New Orleans for like two weeks.
[02:03:58.676 --> 02:04:05.022]  People didn't believe me when I was on air playing local newscast.
[02:04:05.022 --> 02:04:11.727]  Now everybody knows that happened, but the issue is there's this denial right up front that has to stop.
[02:04:11.727 --> 02:04:13.109]  And I'm not criticizing Watson.
[02:04:14.104 --> 02:04:16.726]  I don't have time to call up and give him pointers, you know, when I'm off air.
[02:04:16.726 --> 02:04:17.647]  Not that I have all the answers.
[02:04:17.647 --> 02:04:19.008]  He gives me a lot of pointers as well.
[02:04:19.008 --> 02:04:24.892]  It's just that, you know, all of us, all of us just, I mean, this is what is happening, myself included.
[02:04:24.892 --> 02:04:35.020]  The tyranny is so naked now that we've almost got tyranny fatigue where we're just so used to it now that we're like, well, we guessed it could be for some good uses.
[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:38.183]  Obviously, they need to know how to dispound a Humvee for IED attack or
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:41.461]  How to land a helicopter in an area where it doesn't have IEDs.
[02:04:41.461 --> 02:04:42.901]  Don't land where it's a good landing spot.
[02:04:42.901 --> 02:04:43.982]  That's the rule.
[02:04:43.982 --> 02:04:46.002]  Land 100 yards away randomly.
[02:04:46.002 --> 02:04:48.583]  Land where it's hard to land.
[02:04:48.583 --> 02:04:52.924]  You don't do that in a mock city in English with Washington DC signs.
[02:04:52.924 --> 02:04:58.206]  While you're training for domestic war in all your manuals, and then you say, oh no, it's not for domestic.
[02:05:00.856 --> 02:05:02.757]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:05:02.757 --> 02:05:06.400]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:10.923]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.

[02:06:03.849 --> 02:06:08.872]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:06:08.872 --> 02:06:16.035]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:06:16.175 --> 02:06:21.820]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[02:07:00.617 --> 02:07:04.058]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:07:04.058 --> 02:07:06.479]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:07:06.479 --> 02:07:15.081]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.

[02:08:23.672 --> 02:08:27.456]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:27.456 --> 02:08:41.290]  Generals gathered in their masses Just like witches at black masses Evil minds that plot destruction
[02:08:43.834 --> 02:08:50.466]  Sorcerer of death's construction in the fields of
[02:08:52.369 --> 02:08:54.631]  Spike in my veins.
[02:08:54.631 --> 02:08:58.754]  Jonathan Davis is the lead singer of Korn, one of the big rock bands out there.
[02:08:58.754 --> 02:09:00.235]  We saw the video and thought it was really great.
[02:09:00.235 --> 02:09:06.400]  Listeners sent it to us and said, man, it looks like they're awake to what's going on, dealing with the paradigm shift.
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:10.823]  And we contacted them and it turns out they are familiar with our work and we're happy to come on.
[02:09:10.823 --> 02:09:12.384]  So we're going to get the lead singer on.
[02:09:12.384 --> 02:09:14.105]  He'd be on right now, but it happens all the time.
[02:09:14.105 --> 02:09:15.606]  We're having Skype issues back and forth.
[02:09:15.606 --> 02:09:18.609]  So it could be in five minutes, it could be in the bottom of the hour, it could be next week.
[02:09:20.430 --> 02:09:23.753]  Going back and forth with that right now with Skype issues.
[02:09:23.753 --> 02:09:25.074]  But that is coming up.
[02:09:25.074 --> 02:09:32.120]  In fact, let's play a little bit of the music video for radio listeners slash TV viewers who are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:34.041]  We'll play the whole thing once he joins us, but here it is.
[02:10:15.418 --> 02:10:16.659]  Alright, we'll play the whole thing later.
[02:10:16.659 --> 02:10:17.759]  Great music.
[02:10:17.759 --> 02:10:26.105]  Folks, this is extremely powerful and a big deal, because this is a frontal assault on their main vehicle, Obama.
[02:10:26.105 --> 02:10:29.207]  And that doesn't mean the Republican leadership is good either.
[02:10:29.207 --> 02:10:32.008]  John Boehner and all them are just as bad or worse.
[02:10:32.008 --> 02:10:37.832]  The issue is, is that Obama's been a very effective evil, like Cynthia McKinney has said on this show.
[02:10:37.832 --> 02:10:40.554]  He's not a lesser of two evils, he's a more effective of evils.
[02:10:43.181 --> 02:10:47.102]  And because it makes it trendy to do all this evil.
[02:10:47.102 --> 02:10:56.985]  And the video is just amazing how it exposes the just anti-human, pro-evil garbage that's being sold as a wonderful thing.
[02:10:56.985 --> 02:11:02.126]  So that's coming up as soon as we get his and our Skype working together.
[02:11:02.126 --> 02:11:03.887]  That happens sometimes.
[02:11:03.887 --> 02:11:06.948]  Right now, let's go to Trey in Alabama.
[02:11:06.948 --> 02:11:10.428]  And we'll go to Mike and Brenda and everybody else.
[02:11:10.428 --> 02:11:11.649]  Trey, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:11:13.595 --> 02:11:16.458]  Worldwide Broadcast, good to have you on.
[02:11:16.458 --> 02:11:24.327]  I wanted to talk about the bankers, the elite bankers that have basically thrown themselves off buildings the past, I think it was last week.
[02:11:24.327 --> 02:11:29.033]  You've had like- That's five top ones the last two weeks and dozens of other mid-level ones.
[02:11:29.033 --> 02:11:30.835]  I think they're being killed, but what do you think?
[02:11:33.309 --> 02:11:54.446]  Personally, I don't know if it has to do with they know something that's coming that we don't, or they found something out, or it's like in 29, you know, or the stock market crash that happened before that, you know, people, bankers were throwing themselves off buildings because... See, I could lose everything I've got, and I would be happy
[02:11:55.695 --> 02:11:58.916]  I don't understand people that commit suicide because they lose everything.
[02:11:58.916 --> 02:12:00.056]  I just don't get that.
[02:12:00.056 --> 02:12:03.377]  I mean, these guys aren't losing everything yet, though.
[02:12:03.377 --> 02:12:04.877]  That was the mid-level folks in 29.
[02:12:04.877 --> 02:12:07.317]  And I'm not disagreeing with you.
[02:12:07.317 --> 02:12:09.118]  I'm trying to war game the sound here.
[02:12:09.118 --> 02:12:13.999]  It was the people that lost everything and were in debt who committed suicide over the embarrassment.
[02:12:13.999 --> 02:12:16.699]  It wasn't the insiders who got even richer.
[02:12:16.699 --> 02:12:19.140]  I think they're getting rid of people that know where the bodies are buried.
[02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:21.871]  Yeah, possibly.
[02:12:21.871 --> 02:12:26.993]  Could it have any connection to the global reset that everyone's talking about that could be coming up?
[02:12:26.993 --> 02:12:29.375]  Because nobody wants our dollar anymore, you know?
[02:12:29.375 --> 02:12:31.936]  I don't know.
[02:12:31.936 --> 02:12:37.899]  Yeah, but if these guys have millions or millions of dollars, why don't they just tap out, get out, move to Switzerland like everybody else does?
[02:12:38.689 --> 02:12:39.209]  Right.
[02:12:39.209 --> 02:12:41.910]  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense for what you're saying.
[02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:52.014]  Well, it's like Matt Drudge said two weeks ago in the corporatist media, the dinosaur media, literally on his last leg said, Oh look, he's implying you should leave as if we're in a tyranny.
[02:12:52.014 --> 02:12:52.574]  Uh-huh.
[02:12:52.574 --> 02:12:54.094]  Let them eat cake.
[02:12:54.094 --> 02:12:56.095]  And it just shows how out of touch they are.
[02:12:56.095 --> 02:13:00.817]  Anybody who studies basic history knows we are sitting on top of a
[02:13:02.267 --> 02:13:11.732]  powder keg with about a hundred burning sparklers falling from the sky right now and I don't know when it's going to blow up or how it's going to blow up but it's a question of not if but when.
[02:13:11.732 --> 02:13:12.753]  Anything else?
[02:13:12.753 --> 02:13:27.141]  Well see you got that thing that we got to keep our eyes on that Lindsey Graham said when the nukes came up missing that's one thing that has me very worried when he I think he came out too early that was going to be their little
[02:13:28.311 --> 02:13:35.535]  You know, announcement, point blank, before they do something about blowing up, you know, Charleston or New York.
[02:13:35.535 --> 02:13:38.236]  You know, you remember Lindsey Graham's statement, or do you remember that?
[02:13:38.236 --> 02:13:45.740]  Oh yeah, I remember, in CBS News, at a press conference, hours after we reported the missing nuclear weapons.
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:54.345]  Yeah, and see, I don't know, like, the people say, you know, Iran has the ships out, close to our waters or whatever.
[02:13:55.776 --> 02:14:14.073]  It would just be really convenient for American City to get nuked to draw us into Iran or to hell I mean like 9-11 we could pretty much attack anybody out we wanted it gave us exactly exactly I mean I don't think the head of the Iranian military is stupid enough to actually say
[02:14:15.194 --> 02:14:15.795]  The U.S.
[02:14:15.795 --> 02:14:26.343]  doesn't know we have sleeper cells in North America and they don't know how we're going to strike back against them and then send over some small destroyers as if that means anything.
[02:14:26.343 --> 02:14:31.027]  I mean, just begging the empire to destroy them and take our liberties at the same time.
[02:14:31.027 --> 02:14:35.290]  And then some listeners think I'm like calling for war with Iran.
[02:14:35.290 --> 02:14:37.312]  No, I'm calling for Iran.
[02:14:37.312 --> 02:14:38.553]  What do you think Iran's up to?
[02:14:41.020 --> 02:14:44.921]  It doesn't make sense to me because we got nothing out of the deal.
[02:14:44.921 --> 02:14:50.762]  I mean, with him, it appears, and it just, I don't know, I'm clueless.
[02:14:50.762 --> 02:14:51.862]  I'm puzzled.
[02:14:51.862 --> 02:14:54.062]  Yeah, I'm very rarely puzzled.
[02:14:54.062 --> 02:14:56.803]  Yeah, I mean, I just, stuff's very serious.
[02:14:56.803 --> 02:14:57.263]  I appreciate it.
[02:14:57.263 --> 02:15:08.405]  I was thinking about Breitbart and Tom Clancy and the Rolling Stone guy that were working on, they were all working together on something, and now they're dead.
[02:15:08.405 --> 02:15:08.645]  You know?
[02:15:10.367 --> 02:15:13.169]  Well, let me tell you, I'm blessed that I'm not pushing up daisies.
[02:15:13.169 --> 02:15:13.509]  I hear you.
[02:15:13.509 --> 02:15:14.850]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:14.850 --> 02:15:16.211]  Let's go to Mike in Illinois.
[02:15:16.211 --> 02:15:16.831]  Thanks for holding.
[02:15:16.831 --> 02:15:18.532]  You're listening on WCKG.
[02:15:18.532 --> 02:15:19.973]  I see where people are calling from.
[02:15:19.973 --> 02:15:21.074]  Go ahead.
[02:15:21.074 --> 02:15:21.654]  Hey, Alex.
[02:15:21.654 --> 02:15:23.175]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:15:23.175 --> 02:15:25.837]  Just found you on the radio dial about five, six weeks ago.
[02:15:25.837 --> 02:15:26.818]  I enjoy your show.
[02:15:26.818 --> 02:15:27.678]  Thank you.
[02:15:27.678 --> 02:15:30.560]  Unfortunately, I only get your first two hours.
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:33.542]  Hey, I don't want to change the subject, but I'm going to bring this up.
[02:15:33.542 --> 02:15:34.863]  I'm not sure if you're aware of this.
[02:15:34.863 --> 02:15:37.324]  I know you're aware of fluoride and
[02:15:38.766 --> 02:15:42.748]  Aspartame and all that other garbage that they've got in our food and drink.
[02:15:42.748 --> 02:15:46.789]  Have you ever heard of chelation or EDTA?
[02:15:46.789 --> 02:15:47.809]  Are you familiar with that?
[02:15:47.809 --> 02:15:51.451]  Yes, there's a lot of different forms of chelation to get toxins out of your body.
[02:15:51.451 --> 02:16:05.596]  Okay, I was bringing, the reason I'm bringing it up is I work at a fairly large defense contractor and just since Christmas we've had about five or six of my co-workers have had heart attacks due to blocked arteries and then
[02:16:06.212 --> 02:16:19.416]  You know, the doctors tell them you got to get this bypass surgery or you're going to die and and chelation is so safe and it's so effective that there's a lot of countries where it's actually illegal for the doctors to do that bypass surgery.
[02:16:19.416 --> 02:16:27.118]  So I'm not sure if your audience is aware of that, but I just... Sure, well, I mean, they never tell you to... Why do you think so many people are having heart trouble where you work?
[02:16:27.118 --> 02:16:31.620]  Well, yeah, well, that's a rhetorical question.
[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:35.861]  But, you know, I mean, it's over a couple thousand employees, so it's
[02:16:36.530 --> 02:16:38.772]  Statistically, it's probably not significant.
[02:16:38.772 --> 02:16:47.161]  And again, most of these guys are in their late 40s, early 50s, early 60s, so it's probably around the time that those kinds of problems are going to show up.
[02:16:47.161 --> 02:16:58.051]  But it's just a shame that more people are not aware of it as an alternative to these angioplasties or these bypass surgeries, which have anywhere from a 5 to a
[02:16:59.073 --> 02:17:05.116]  8 or 9 percent morbidity rate and you know, chelation is totally safe and it's relatively inexpensive.
[02:17:05.116 --> 02:17:07.177]  Yeah, they killed Neil Armstrong on one of those surgeries.
[02:17:07.177 --> 02:17:08.398]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:08.398 --> 02:17:10.319]  Thank you so much.
[02:17:10.319 --> 02:17:10.879]  Thank you.
[02:17:10.879 --> 02:17:12.700]  Brenda in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:13.080]  Go ahead.
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:23.545]  I want you to hear something that we got from the county that I left on my answering machine.
[02:17:23.545 --> 02:17:25.986]  Are you ready?
[02:17:25.986 --> 02:17:26.907]  Okay, well tell me about it.
[02:17:28.017 --> 02:17:34.719]  It's asking for us to all get vaccines in our county for us and our neighbors.
[02:17:34.719 --> 02:17:39.521]  We've never had this happen before and one of them is a red alert that we all have to sign up for.
[02:17:39.521 --> 02:17:41.541]  Yeah, but you don't have to sign up for that.
[02:17:41.541 --> 02:17:43.982]  Government, though, is inducing you through contract fraud.
[02:17:44.542 --> 02:17:50.006]  They even have folks under federal grants that come bang on your door and say, time to get your shots.
[02:17:50.006 --> 02:17:52.108]  And the big pharma is actually being paid.
[02:17:52.108 --> 02:17:54.489]  It's a big corporate boondoggle.
[02:17:54.489 --> 02:17:57.432]  And all the statistics show these vaccines are deadly.
[02:17:57.432 --> 02:18:01.434]  And again, I'm not saying the science of inoculation doesn't have some merits in history.
[02:18:01.434 --> 02:18:03.816]  The problem is you can't trust these big companies.
[02:18:03.816 --> 02:18:05.317]  They're putting other stuff in them.
[02:18:05.317 --> 02:18:11.162]  And even a good vaccine ends up lowering your immunity just like antibiotics do.
[02:18:11.162 --> 02:18:12.082]  And by the way, the good news is
[02:18:15.126 --> 02:18:20.430]  After a little bit of pressure, Chick-fil-A is going to stop getting chicken that has antibiotics in it.
[02:18:20.430 --> 02:18:23.752]  Now, would you like to hear this, though?
[02:18:23.752 --> 02:18:24.152]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:24.152 --> 02:18:27.674]  In fact, you can scan it and send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:18:27.674 --> 02:18:32.238]  I'm aware it's been going on, but you just said we're required to sign up for this red alert.
[02:18:32.238 --> 02:18:32.758]  Tell me about it.
[02:18:33.564 --> 02:18:37.666]  Yeah, well, it's, um, it's, well, it's an audio.
[02:18:37.666 --> 02:18:40.208]  I've actually made a recording of it for you to hear.
[02:18:40.208 --> 02:18:41.608]  Oh, so it was sent to you over your phone?
[02:18:41.608 --> 02:18:43.469]  Yes, sir, and I saved it.
[02:18:43.469 --> 02:18:51.013]  Yeah, government, I told you, was first sending you video, audio, first was text, fear-mongering you, and then literally turning your phone on at night.
[02:18:51.013 --> 02:18:52.074]  Yeah, go ahead and play the audio.
[02:18:52.074 --> 02:18:53.755]  Okay, just a second.
[02:18:53.755 --> 02:18:56.796]  Here we go.
[02:18:56.796 --> 02:18:58.777]  No new messages.
[02:18:58.777 --> 02:19:00.198]  All messages played back.
[02:19:00.842 --> 02:19:02.804]  No new messages.
[02:19:02.804 --> 02:19:04.326]  All messages played back.
[02:19:04.326 --> 02:19:13.095]  Important message for all residents and businesses located in Torrance County.

[02:19:57.753 --> 02:20:02.155]  You can also call the Torrance County Dispatch Center directly at 384-1022 for assistance.
[02:20:02.155 --> 02:20:03.456]  That number again is 384-1022.
[02:20:03.456 --> 02:20:03.856]  Thank you.
[02:20:10.319 --> 02:20:13.280]  No, just a second, I have one more for you.
[02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:24.822]  Sure, sure, but first it's Missing Ladies, and then it's Missing Kids, and then it's... 5, 6, 7, 8, just a second, here's one more.
[02:20:24.822 --> 02:20:25.542]  I understand.
[02:20:25.542 --> 02:20:28.303]  Then it's Turn Your Neighbor In.
[02:20:28.303 --> 02:20:33.824]  This is the Torrance County 911 Dispatch Center with an important announcement from the New Mexico Department of Health.
[02:20:34.844 --> 02:20:44.114]  The New Mexico Department of Health, in partnership with Orange County Government, will be providing flu vaccinations on Friday, February 14th, from noon until 6 p.m.
[02:20:44.114 --> 02:20:48.839]  at the McLeod Medical Center located in Lagerty, New Mexico.
[02:20:48.839 --> 02:20:51.822]  The immunization clinic is open to the public at no cost.
[02:20:52.768 --> 02:21:07.960]  For more information on the No Charge Flu Shot Clinic, please call the Montgomery Public Health Office at 832-6782, or the Torrance County Emergency Manager's Office, 246-4748.
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:10.202]  This is government pushing its services.
[02:21:10.202 --> 02:21:12.343]  Is this bizarre?
[02:21:12.343 --> 02:21:12.763]  No, ma'am.
[02:21:12.763 --> 02:21:15.586]  I thought you would like to hear all that.
[02:21:15.586 --> 02:21:16.066]  No, I would.
[02:21:16.066 --> 02:21:18.908]  Go ahead and turn your machine off now, and let me just tell you what's happening.
[02:21:18.908 --> 02:21:19.749]  Okay, just a second.
[02:21:22.867 --> 02:21:23.628]  Okay.
[02:21:23.628 --> 02:21:24.288]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:21:24.288 --> 02:21:27.952]  Ma'am, they tried this in the 80s.
[02:21:27.952 --> 02:21:38.682]  All the new radios in your car, you buy at the store, most of the cost is a chip at them that picks up shortwave or AM from government transmitters that orders it to turn on.
[02:21:39.949 --> 02:21:44.552]  Some of you have a capacitor so it can operate for a time without plug power.
[02:21:44.552 --> 02:21:46.254]  And then it gives you orders.
[02:21:46.254 --> 02:21:48.956]  Over your cell phone, you get Obama emails.
[02:21:48.956 --> 02:21:52.779]  My dad gets them every day, I get them every week.
[02:21:52.779 --> 02:21:56.741]  The flashing signs that say we've got an Alzheimer's missing woman.
[02:21:56.741 --> 02:22:01.505]  It all sounds reasonable, but then it can be jacked in to be a political tool.
[02:22:01.505 --> 02:22:06.489]  You heard it saying, tell your neighbors, give us their data, and in the future it will be
[02:22:08.188 --> 02:22:11.310]  You will arrive at this point or you will be arrested later.
[02:22:11.310 --> 02:22:22.759]  So this is government now getting into your life, taking over your phones, taking over your computers, data mining you, and using your phone number and information to call up.
[02:22:22.759 --> 02:22:26.362]  This is 911 with an emergency information for you.
[02:22:26.362 --> 02:22:31.105]  All to again prepare you to interface with government to be bossed around.
[02:22:31.105 --> 02:22:33.027]  That's what the TSA is.
[02:22:33.027 --> 02:22:36.810]  Normal people who aren't criminals aren't supposed to have regular contact with bureaucrats.
[02:22:38.081 --> 02:22:46.908]  But you're being prepared to literally be bathed in these people, and the new work projects during the Depression won't be building dams or park sites.
[02:22:46.908 --> 02:22:52.092]  It will be being part of the Tattletail Squats, and reporting on neighbors' guns.
[02:22:52.092 --> 02:22:56.235]  And all of this has already been done in other countries, in Europe and other places.
[02:22:56.235 --> 02:22:59.698]  And so, this is a takeover plan.
[02:22:59.698 --> 02:23:02.660]  And it is absolutely authoritarian.
[02:23:02.660 --> 02:23:04.242]  They have Walmarts all over the country.
[02:23:05.970 --> 02:23:10.655]  Where you go up to a robot kiosk and it goes, Obamacare helps you!
[02:23:10.655 --> 02:23:12.476]  Now buy healthcare!
[02:23:12.476 --> 02:23:21.205]  And then it told Jakari Jackson, who's got 3% body fat, that he was obese and, you know, it tells people who have low blood sugar that they're, you know, diabetic, even though they have low blood sugar.
[02:23:21.205 --> 02:23:24.208]  It's total quack garbage.
[02:23:24.208 --> 02:23:30.013]  You know, you go into one of these computers now, my grandmother did, and they said, have you had sugary snacks today?
[02:23:30.013 --> 02:23:30.253]  Yes.
[02:23:31.223 --> 02:23:35.508]  And then they said, well, then we can't give you the test, you know, for diabetes.
[02:23:35.508 --> 02:23:37.690]  You've never had it, though, at, you know, 89 or whatever.
[02:23:37.690 --> 02:23:40.092]  This happened just last year.
[02:23:40.092 --> 02:23:49.843]  And so, still, they said, well, the computer says you're diabetic, even though you ate sugary snacks, and the blood test, you know, shows that you had a little bit of high blood sugar, but it's not diabetes.
[02:23:49.843 --> 02:23:51.885]  We're just gonna go ahead and say you're diabetic, take this pill.
[02:23:52.671 --> 02:23:58.014]  And then she took the pill and passed out and basically almost died because it took her blood sugar down to nothing.
[02:23:58.014 --> 02:24:02.296]  And my dad called up the doctor, because my dad's a physician, and said, you're not supposed to do that.
[02:24:02.296 --> 02:24:09.480]  You're supposed to do a, I forget the name of the test, where they slice up the red blood cells and go back over a month to get the real average of the blood sugar.
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:10.681]  They just said, well, we don't do that now.
[02:24:10.681 --> 02:24:12.642]  We follow Obamacare.
[02:24:12.642 --> 02:24:15.544]  So Obamacare, and so my dad took her back to another doctor.
[02:24:15.544 --> 02:24:17.145]  No, you don't even have high sugar.
[02:24:17.145 --> 02:24:20.206]  You're in really great shape for 89 years old.
[02:24:20.206 --> 02:24:21.187]  You don't need any drugs.
[02:24:22.677 --> 02:24:24.882]  But, this is America.
[02:24:24.882 --> 02:24:30.674]  It's all run by robots, it's all run by computers, it's all run by centralized committees, and all your data is public.
[02:24:31.537 --> 02:24:32.758]  And this is the beginning.
[02:24:32.758 --> 02:24:39.020]  I've told everybody forever, it's going to start with, you know, there's an old lady missing, there's a child missing, and next it's going to be report illegal guns.
[02:24:39.020 --> 02:24:46.123]  Well, they now have the images flashing showing a revolver reporting illegal guns all over the country, including Austin.
[02:24:46.123 --> 02:24:54.106]  And the carpet cleaner comes to your house and sees a Colt 911-45 framed above your bed.
[02:24:54.106 --> 02:24:56.166]  You are going to be SWAT teamed.
[02:24:56.166 --> 02:24:57.527]  Doesn't matter if the gun's completely legal.
[02:24:58.442 --> 02:25:01.705]  When they get a call, they respond, they take the guns.
[02:25:01.705 --> 02:25:05.970]  And you don't get them back, and then they go, you'll give your guns back, go to psychological evaluation.
[02:25:05.970 --> 02:25:08.513]  Well, it's their psychological evaluator.
[02:25:08.513 --> 02:25:10.415]  And they go, are you mad about your gun being taken?
[02:25:10.415 --> 02:25:15.640]  Well, yeah, I have no criminal record, and it was legal, and they pushed my head in the ground, I'm upset.
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:20.705]  Well, that's an opposition to authority paranoia in the psychological manual.
[02:25:21.806 --> 02:25:25.368]  Your guns are all gone and now CPS is going to be there next week.
[02:25:25.368 --> 02:25:26.048]  They don't even tell you that.
[02:25:26.048 --> 02:25:27.169]  They go, you can go now.
[02:25:27.169 --> 02:25:29.170]  Then CPS comes and takes your kids.
[02:25:29.170 --> 02:25:30.031]  No judge, no jury.
[02:25:30.031 --> 02:25:30.611]  You've done nothing.
[02:25:30.611 --> 02:25:31.632]  Your life's over.
[02:25:31.632 --> 02:25:32.392]  Hardcore!
[02:25:32.392 --> 02:25:33.092]  They rule!
[02:25:33.092 --> 02:25:33.653]  They control!
[02:25:34.997 --> 02:25:37.578]  Drink your fluoride, take your shots, roll over and die.
[02:25:37.578 --> 02:25:42.982]  Give your kid a shot in the hospital, have them convulse right in front of you, never talk again.
[02:25:42.982 --> 02:25:45.983]  You try to get in that doctor's face, here come cops.
[02:25:45.983 --> 02:25:48.605]  The cops got brain damaged kids, nobody cares.
[02:25:48.605 --> 02:25:50.686]  We love death, we're gonna get it!
[02:25:50.686 --> 02:25:54.708]  High tech, hell released, you want it, you got it.
[02:25:54.708 --> 02:25:59.751]  And yes, those type of garbage alerts are the exact type of thing we're dealing with.
[02:25:59.751 --> 02:26:01.252]  Anything else, ma'am?
[02:26:01.252 --> 02:26:03.013]  That's it, I just wanted you to hear it.
[02:26:03.766 --> 02:26:04.446]  Thank you so much.
[02:26:04.446 --> 02:26:05.687]  I really appreciate you calling in.
[02:26:05.687 --> 02:26:08.268]  There goes Brenda.
[02:26:08.268 --> 02:26:09.929]  Lee in Georgia.
[02:26:09.929 --> 02:26:11.510]  You're on the air.
[02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:13.631]  First time caller.
[02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:15.512]  Alex, how's it going, man?
[02:26:15.512 --> 02:26:19.153]  I'm a little bit under the weather, but other than that, I'm doing good.
[02:26:19.153 --> 02:26:20.114]  Hey, I hear you, brother.
[02:26:20.114 --> 02:26:21.575]  Hey, we appreciate you.
[02:26:21.575 --> 02:26:23.135]  We all appreciate you out here, man.
[02:26:23.135 --> 02:26:25.657]  By the way, happy belated 40th, dude.
[02:26:25.657 --> 02:26:26.177]  Thank you, brother.
[02:26:27.403 --> 02:26:28.164]  No problem, man.
[02:26:28.164 --> 02:26:36.650]  Hey, I have kind of a multi-faceted topic here that deals with something that one of your callers earlier was talking about, about the mega-bankers' suicide.
[02:26:36.650 --> 02:26:40.792]  Yes, I want to hear what you have to say on that.
[02:26:40.792 --> 02:26:42.374]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:42.374 --> 02:26:51.200]  How do you think that their deaths play into the foreign exchange scandal that's happening right now?
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:52.541]  Elaborate on that and I'll give you my answer.
[02:26:57.928 --> 02:27:08.218]  I would just like to get your take on the speculation of how this is going to affect the Iraqi Dinar revaluation.
[02:27:08.218 --> 02:27:09.460]  I'm not ignoring you, sir.
[02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:12.503]  I was talking to somebody.
[02:27:12.503 --> 02:27:13.604]  They were giving me some information.
[02:27:13.604 --> 02:27:14.825]  I'm going to call them right back during the break.
[02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:16.927]  I don't usually take calls during a break.
[02:27:16.927 --> 02:27:17.568]  I heard your question.
[02:27:17.568 --> 02:27:19.390]  I was going to have you talk some more and then go back to it.
[02:27:21.946 --> 02:27:24.247]  Look, I don't know why the bankers are dying.
[02:27:24.247 --> 02:27:28.650]  There are all sorts of scandals going on right now.
[02:27:28.650 --> 02:27:34.994]  There are all sorts of things unfolding right now.
[02:27:34.994 --> 02:27:36.795]  And all sorts of corruption.
[02:27:36.795 --> 02:27:40.197]  But I believe these bankers are being murdered, they're not committing suicide.
[02:27:41.069 --> 02:27:41.870]  Because they don't do that.
[02:27:41.870 --> 02:27:43.331]  They always run.
[02:27:43.331 --> 02:27:44.932]  Why should they commit suicide?
[02:27:44.932 --> 02:27:49.537]  And it's always like comptroller level for the mafias that are behind the scenes.
[02:27:49.537 --> 02:27:50.978]  Like something out of the Pelican Brief.
[02:27:50.978 --> 02:27:56.303]  So, it's still just speculation, so I don't like to get into it too much.
[02:27:56.303 --> 02:27:58.565]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:58.565 --> 02:28:06.171]  Like I said, there's a lot of speculation, especially on the internet, about how the Iraqis and ours are going to be evaluated.
[02:28:07.506 --> 02:28:16.128]  A lot of people think that it's coming close to time for Dinar to be traded as foreign exchange.
[02:28:16.128 --> 02:28:16.749]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:28:16.749 --> 02:28:19.850]  A lot of people invested in Dinar and I told them not to.
[02:28:19.850 --> 02:28:22.370]  And Iraq is in a mess.
[02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:25.531]  The oil is denominated in dollars.
[02:28:25.531 --> 02:28:28.872]  And they've already inflated the Iraqi currency so much.
[02:28:28.872 --> 02:28:34.334]  And it's gone up and down that I don't think bankers are going to be killing themselves over the Dinar.
[02:28:34.334 --> 02:28:35.314]  But I appreciate your call.
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:43.764]  They'd be getting killed over who was involved in derivatives and JP Morgan and all these settlements that they're making right now for all the scams they've run.
[02:28:43.764 --> 02:28:48.666]  Ralph in Texas, go ahead, you've got about a minute and ten seconds.
[02:28:48.666 --> 02:28:51.988]  Alex, I was just calling about your earlier guest.
[02:28:51.988 --> 02:28:58.651]  I want to say that he's completely wrong about Dr. Michio Kaku.
[02:28:58.651 --> 02:29:03.574]  Dr. Michio Kaku is a really smart theoretical physicist and all those quacky things
[02:29:04.739 --> 02:29:07.460]  Uh, that he's saying about the telepathy and telekinesis?
[02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:08.861]  Right, yeah, I understand.
[02:29:08.861 --> 02:29:10.242]  And, uh, yeah, I just wanted to get to, uh, you know, just...
[02:29:32.134 --> 02:29:36.898]  I'll tell you what, after our guest leaves us and we're able to get him on Skype, I want to bring you back to make your statement.
[02:29:36.898 --> 02:29:38.379]  I don't want to just cut you off there.
[02:29:38.379 --> 02:29:40.821]  I want to hear what your criticism is.
[02:29:40.821 --> 02:29:46.006]  But we'll be right back on the other side of the break.
[02:29:46.006 --> 02:29:50.369]  I was actually calling one of the guys in the back to bring me some nasal spray.
[02:29:50.369 --> 02:29:51.770]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.770 --> 02:29:54.292]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.292 --> 02:29:56.955]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.015 --> 02:30:11.702]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:30:11.702 --> 02:30:13.763]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:30:13.763 --> 02:30:14.644]  Fluoride.
[02:30:14.644 --> 02:30:16.565]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:30:16.565 --> 02:30:23.150]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:28.073]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:30:28.073 --> 02:30:30.755]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[02:30:31.095 --> 02:30:31.595]  We're good.
[02:31:00.939 --> 02:31:05.661]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:31:05.661 --> 02:31:08.782]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:31:08.782 --> 02:31:14.343]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:14.343 --> 02:31:15.944]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:16.264 --> 02:31:17.905]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:17.905 --> 02:31:22.587]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:22.587 --> 02:31:26.790]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:29.351]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:29.351 --> 02:31:35.594]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:00.877 --> 02:32:01.917]  The facts are in.
[02:32:01.917 --> 02:32:03.318]  The studies are legion.
[02:32:03.318 --> 02:32:10.821]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:32:10.821 --> 02:32:14.642]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:32:14.642 --> 02:32:15.222]  Simple.
[02:32:15.222 --> 02:32:19.564]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:32:19.944 --> 02:32:25.647]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:32:25.647 --> 02:32:31.190]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:41.995]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:32:41.995 --> 02:32:43.816]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[02:32:43.956 --> 02:32:46.559]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:32:46.559 --> 02:32:48.722]  I use Fluoride Shield everyday.
[02:32:48.722 --> 02:32:54.288]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:32:54.288 --> 02:32:58.694]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:32:58.694 --> 02:32:59.975]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:33:11.161 --> 02:33:13.824]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:33:13.824 --> 02:33:16.807]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:16.807 --> 02:33:19.249]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.249 --> 02:33:24.354]  Shooter Jennings bringing us in.
[02:33:35.598 --> 02:33:38.381]  Monday, Jonathan Davis of Korn.com is going to be on all of this.
[02:33:38.381 --> 02:33:39.663]  I'm really interested in getting him on.
[02:33:39.663 --> 02:33:43.688]  I'm glad we contacted him a few weeks ago and they're ready to come on a short notice.
[02:33:43.688 --> 02:33:50.916]  Skype is just, for whatever reason, it happens sometimes, even people we regularly interview, they just won't make the connection on two different computers.
[02:33:52.970 --> 02:33:55.654]  We will get him on Monday if they're able to work out all those problems.
[02:33:55.654 --> 02:33:59.860]  If not, we'll just get him on via phone, but Skype is more powerful, so we'll look forward to that.
[02:33:59.860 --> 02:34:02.944]  Coming up and play that music video on Monday.
[02:34:02.944 --> 02:34:05.087]  I'll be back this Sunday, of course, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:34:05.087 --> 02:34:05.928]  Central.
[02:34:05.928 --> 02:34:07.550]  I want to go back to the caller.
[02:34:08.351 --> 02:34:09.971]  Was that Ralph in Texas I was just talking to?
[02:34:09.971 --> 02:34:12.992]  I want to be able to finish his point about Michio Kaku.
[02:34:12.992 --> 02:34:14.832]  That was called Michio Kaku.
[02:34:14.832 --> 02:34:15.793]  Just being silly folks.
[02:34:15.793 --> 02:34:17.373]  You gotta have some fun with this.
[02:34:17.373 --> 02:34:20.193]  And then Roger in Canada and others.
[02:34:20.193 --> 02:34:25.334]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:34:25.334 --> 02:34:34.456]  And then I'm going to get into a video that just went up on Infowars.com that is excellent and comes from a comedy perspective.
[02:34:34.456 --> 02:34:37.597]  Some of it's a little bit racy from maybe a 10th grade perspective.
[02:34:38.557 --> 02:34:44.521]  But it's the folks that made American Dream, that great animated 30-minute film.
[02:34:44.521 --> 02:34:50.285]  And it breaks it down, so we're going to be... In fact, will you guys print me off that data sheet on it just so I have it?
[02:34:50.285 --> 02:34:51.005]  It's video.
[02:34:51.005 --> 02:34:52.126]  Baby's Got a Gun.
[02:34:52.126 --> 02:34:57.169]  And I'm going to tweak that out at Real Alex Jones here in just a few minutes.
[02:34:57.169 --> 02:35:01.211]  And I'm going to play that video that gives you statistics and facts.
[02:35:01.211 --> 02:35:01.992]  And it's all about
[02:35:03.154 --> 02:35:09.599]  Getting people already that are very successful and have all these platinum records like Korn and others to speak out against the tyranny.
[02:35:09.599 --> 02:35:14.182]  But it's about getting grassroots filmmakers to make their own films and counter the lies.
[02:35:14.182 --> 02:35:16.364]  That's what it's really all about.
[02:35:16.364 --> 02:35:22.969]  And I get that physicist Michio Kaku is a smart guy.
[02:35:22.969 --> 02:35:28.613]  The point is they couldn't get a regular meteorologist or even astrophysicist on.
[02:35:28.613 --> 02:35:30.454]  They got a guy on, I read his quotes.
[02:35:31.630 --> 02:35:36.054]  About how unusual warm is causing the freeze.
[02:35:36.054 --> 02:35:39.658]  They put that in that Al Gore-supported movie.
[02:35:39.658 --> 02:35:40.459]  It was a fiction.
[02:35:40.459 --> 02:35:45.484]  The day after tomorrow, whatever it was, that Art Bell was involved in, and the whole world freezes because it's so warm.
[02:35:46.377 --> 02:35:47.578]  I mean, just give me a break, folks.
[02:35:47.578 --> 02:35:49.880]  The sun is the main driver.
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:56.687]  It's about taxes, and the whole carbon tax thing distracts from all the crises in our environment.
[02:35:56.687 --> 02:36:06.736]  The overfishing, the toxic waste dumping, the toxic pesticides that are being used, the chemical fertilizers that don't give you the nutrients you need.
[02:36:06.736 --> 02:36:09.299]  There's thousands of serious... The honeybees die.
[02:36:10.899 --> 02:36:15.301]  But it all comes down to taxing carbon because we're a carbon-based economy.
[02:36:15.301 --> 02:36:16.941]  And I'm not saying oil's great.
[02:36:16.941 --> 02:36:24.264]  They've suppressed all sorts of other technology by funding the fake green movement, windmills and all this stuff.
[02:36:24.264 --> 02:36:33.527]  I'm sick of them acting like they're the progressives that want humanity to progress when they're the Agenda 21ers on record.
[02:36:33.527 --> 02:36:33.987]  On record.
[02:36:36.104 --> 02:36:39.986]  That say they want to shut down society for the general public as a tool of control.
[02:36:39.986 --> 02:36:41.687]  I know their internal documents.
[02:36:41.687 --> 02:36:44.268]  I know their political writings.
[02:36:44.268 --> 02:36:45.048]  I know who they are!
[02:36:45.048 --> 02:36:55.313]  Now, I don't know if... Kaku is a bad guy individually.
[02:36:55.313 --> 02:36:59.595]  But I know that him saying this is global warming is a load of bull.
[02:36:59.595 --> 02:37:03.457]  So for 17 years the Earth's been cooling.
[02:37:03.457 --> 02:37:05.378]  Compared to the warming cycle we've had since the 50s.
[02:37:08.789 --> 02:37:12.152]  And folks, I've read the history books that were written hundreds of years ago.
[02:37:12.152 --> 02:37:12.972]  It wasn't about global warming.
[02:37:12.972 --> 02:37:13.633]  It wasn't about debating.
[02:37:13.633 --> 02:37:20.598]  It was about, you know, for a 10-year period, the major rivers in England all froze over.
[02:37:20.598 --> 02:37:22.339]  And then for 50 years, nothing froze over.
[02:37:22.339 --> 02:37:26.042]  You know, there used to be grapes a thousand years ago growing in northern England.
[02:37:26.042 --> 02:37:27.323]  Now you can't grow grapes there.
[02:37:27.323 --> 02:37:28.143]  There's cycles.
[02:37:28.143 --> 02:37:30.625]  There was the Iberian Maxim 10,000 years ago.
[02:37:33.291 --> 02:37:36.292]  Where Northern Europe was like the Bahamas or something.
[02:37:36.292 --> 02:37:37.873]  I mean, I'm just sick.
[02:37:37.873 --> 02:37:40.934]  I mean, it was like 15 degrees hotter or something on average.
[02:37:40.934 --> 02:37:43.715]  It was insane.
[02:37:43.715 --> 02:37:47.356]  And paying money to the globalists is not going to fix things.
[02:37:47.356 --> 02:37:55.319]  So that's why we were calling him cuckoo and stuff, because he's not cuckoo.
[02:37:55.319 --> 02:37:57.059]  I think he knows what he's doing.
[02:37:57.059 --> 02:38:01.681]  Now, now, Ralph, I don't want to just... You tell me what you have an issue with.
[02:38:01.681 --> 02:38:01.981]  Go ahead.
[02:38:03.869 --> 02:38:08.873]  Uh, yeah, I totally agree with you about getting a theoretical physicist to talk about climate.
[02:38:08.873 --> 02:38:10.274]  Uh, I think that's dumb.
[02:38:10.274 --> 02:38:17.720]  But the, you know, he, the thing, like the, the kooky things that he says about, uh, telekinesis and telepathy and things like that.
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:28.789]  He's talking about, like, what you say about the advancement in technology and how we'll be able to have, uh, portable MRIs that already can take crude images.
[02:38:28.789 --> 02:38:31.652]  They already have that in the airports as a test ten years ago.
[02:38:31.652 --> 02:38:32.532]  No, no, no, no.
[02:38:32.532 --> 02:38:32.813]  I hear you.
[02:38:32.813 --> 02:38:33.013]  Go ahead.
[02:38:34.835 --> 02:38:43.440]  Right, and they'll be able to make a mobile version of this and that's how we'll be able to have a kind of telepathy that he's talking about it.
[02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:45.471]  No, no, listen, listen.
[02:38:45.471 --> 02:38:53.016]  They've got studies showing magnetic lines, that birds navigate off magnetics, that humans have those cells.
[02:38:53.016 --> 02:38:57.138]  It's really just science, and people don't under six cents, all of it.
[02:38:57.138 --> 02:38:59.300]  And so, I don't think that discredits him.
[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:05.604]  I actually think he's a really smart guy, and that's why I actually get mad at him when he's saying it's global warming, just because that's like a liberal sacrament.
[02:39:06.224 --> 02:39:10.545]  And some of the crew was like, hey man, Michio Kaku is a pretty interesting guy.
[02:39:10.545 --> 02:39:11.245]  Why are you saying that?
[02:39:11.245 --> 02:39:12.946]  I was just going along with Moreno.
[02:39:12.946 --> 02:39:18.227]  Moreno is just mad at him because he's lying about global warming and not using science.
[02:39:18.227 --> 02:39:20.888]  And so he was getting into some of his more theoretical stuff.
[02:39:20.888 --> 02:39:21.628]  But I hear you.
[02:39:21.628 --> 02:39:23.688]  Anything else?
[02:39:23.688 --> 02:39:25.469]  Yeah, I think you just have him on the show.
[02:39:25.469 --> 02:39:26.249]  One more thing.
[02:39:26.249 --> 02:39:34.811]  I don't know if anybody told you, but this last Austin City Limits, Matt Bellamy from the band Muse gave you a shout out when he was doing the song Uprising.
[02:39:35.353 --> 02:39:43.255]  And I just thought it was, uh, you know, the trendies had no idea what he was talking about, but yeah, I turned him on when he gave you a shout out.
[02:39:43.255 --> 02:39:46.796]  So when was this a year ago?
[02:39:46.796 --> 02:39:48.916]  Uh, it was last October.
[02:39:48.916 --> 02:39:51.197]  At what, what event?
[02:39:51.197 --> 02:39:53.457]  The ACL, Austin City Limits.
[02:39:53.457 --> 02:39:53.957]  Yeah.
[02:39:53.957 --> 02:39:54.818]  ACL.
[02:39:54.818 --> 02:40:00.259]  We should dig up his, his stuff online and find that he's a great guy on his website.
[02:40:00.259 --> 02:40:03.380]  We're like the only link he has on there to politics.
[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:04.180]  And then, um,
[02:40:05.717 --> 02:40:10.481]  He'd go on the BBC everywhere and wear InfoWars.com shirts and TerrorStorm shirts.
[02:40:10.481 --> 02:40:11.722]  I don't even care.
[02:40:11.722 --> 02:40:13.984]  He's been on the show before.
[02:40:13.984 --> 02:40:16.146]  One time I heard he was in town and gave him a call and he came on.
[02:40:16.146 --> 02:40:20.410]  It's not that big of a deal except that I like his music, so I'd like to get him on.
[02:40:20.410 --> 02:40:21.171]  But hey, that's fine.
[02:40:21.171 --> 02:40:23.573]  We appreciate Matthew Bellamy giving us a shout out.
[02:40:23.573 --> 02:40:25.034]  Alright, I'm going to go to this video.
[02:40:25.034 --> 02:40:27.917]  I'm going to come back with more of your calls.
[02:40:27.917 --> 02:40:30.859]  Again, this video is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:40:33.241 --> 02:40:35.463]  And it is titled, Babies Got a Gun.
[02:40:35.463 --> 02:40:40.308]  And it's the first tile in the featured news area.
[02:40:40.308 --> 02:40:55.061]  When you go up there to the site, if you want to share it with people, and it breaks down the reality of gun control, here it is.
[02:40:55.061 --> 02:40:57.103]  Man walks in the room.
[02:40:57.103 --> 02:40:59.105]  He's hit by shock and awe shorts.
[02:41:00.461 --> 02:41:01.621]  Lightning.
[02:41:01.621 --> 02:41:02.681]  Columbine.
[02:41:02.681 --> 02:41:03.642]  Virginia Tech.
[02:41:03.642 --> 02:41:04.622]  Tucson.
[02:41:04.622 --> 02:41:05.522]  Aurora.
[02:41:05.522 --> 02:41:06.602]  Fort Hood.
[02:41:06.602 --> 02:41:07.722]  Oak Creek.
[02:41:07.722 --> 02:41:08.563]  Newtown.
[02:41:08.563 --> 02:41:09.363]  Newtown.
[02:41:09.363 --> 02:41:10.063]  Newtown.
[02:41:10.063 --> 02:41:18.664]  The pair of you would like to have the right to have a tank and you don't agree with a single one of President Obama's proposals for gun control.
[02:41:18.664 --> 02:41:20.205]  And you know something?
[02:41:20.205 --> 02:41:24.186]  It makes me sick when I hear people say that kind of thing.
[02:41:24.186 --> 02:41:25.526]  Demand a plan.
[02:41:25.526 --> 02:41:26.526]  I know the Second Amendment.
[02:41:26.886 --> 02:41:34.788]  What I haven't heard is one coherent reason why any civilian in America needs an AR-15 military-style assault weapon.
[02:41:34.788 --> 02:41:36.368]  Tell me why you need one.
[02:41:36.368 --> 02:41:37.529]  As a husband.
[02:41:37.529 --> 02:41:38.569]  As a wife.
[02:41:38.569 --> 02:41:39.789]  As an American.
[02:41:39.789 --> 02:41:41.290]  As an American.
[02:41:41.290 --> 02:41:43.110]  As an American.
[02:41:43.110 --> 02:41:49.912]  Over the past four years, fear of a black president has made gun sales shoot through the roof and into the apartment upstairs.
[02:41:49.912 --> 02:41:53.373]  Now, what are these white people so afraid of out in the suburbs?
[02:41:53.373 --> 02:41:55.093]  For the children of Sandy Hook.
[02:41:55.779 --> 02:42:05.201]  But on the NRA side is also the argument that we must be taking up arms in order to potentially fight a military battle against the US government.
[02:42:05.201 --> 02:42:09.682]  So it's that argument and maybe 10% of the population on their side of the argument.
[02:42:09.682 --> 02:42:10.722]  It's time.
[02:42:10.722 --> 02:42:11.603]  It's time.
[02:42:11.603 --> 02:42:13.603]  It's time for our leaders to act.
[02:42:13.603 --> 02:42:15.443]  Demand a plan.
[02:42:15.443 --> 02:42:16.364]  Right now.
[02:42:16.364 --> 02:42:22.245]  You know, coming from Britain, as I did, I find a lot of the gun laws in this country incomprehensible.
[02:42:25.157 --> 02:42:33.944]  Okay, okay, my eyes are bleeding watching the Englishman and his merry band of shoulder parents play Manchurian Candidate with the hearts and minds of the American people.
[02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:36.746]  What if everything we just heard isn't true?
[02:42:36.746 --> 02:42:41.389]  What if it's a narrative not based on fact, but on irrational fear and an overdose of elitist smug?
[02:42:42.541 --> 02:42:44.562]  As you can see, I'm just a baby.
[02:42:44.562 --> 02:42:50.125]  Granted, a badass baby, but even I know a lie repeated a thousand times is still a lie.
[02:42:50.125 --> 02:42:55.888]  A badass bloodline has been at war with the lying liars for a long time now.
[02:42:55.888 --> 02:42:59.810]  My Uncle Batty-Ass the Fourth took out the White House trash.
[02:42:59.810 --> 02:43:04.573]  My grandfather, real badass, helped save Private Ryan and the Holy Grail from the Nazis.
[02:43:05.393 --> 02:43:10.814]  Going all the way back to Badassius I, who defeated the so-called God King.
[02:43:10.814 --> 02:43:14.515]  Badass babies have been cleaning up history's mess for a long time.
[02:43:14.515 --> 02:43:17.916]  And now, it's my turn.
[02:43:17.916 --> 02:43:23.918]  Now the Blink Blink Box talks about guns like they're the six-chamber apocalypse smelted in Satan's workshop.
[02:43:23.918 --> 02:43:25.778]  But Satan don't use guns.
[02:43:25.778 --> 02:43:29.559]  He uses trickery, which is why so many believe that guns are the problem.
[02:43:29.559 --> 02:43:33.380]  We have more guns now than ever, and crime has plummeted.
[02:43:34.775 --> 02:43:36.877]  Permettez-moi de répéter.
[02:43:36.877 --> 02:43:42.882]  French for, let me repeat for you, we have more guns, less rules, and less crime.
[02:43:42.882 --> 02:43:44.583]  I know, I know.
[02:43:44.583 --> 02:43:50.829]  With all the dire headlines screamed by hysteria and his sisters in the press, you would think it's modern warfare out there.
[02:43:53.626 --> 02:43:55.827]  But actually, it's not.
[02:43:55.827 --> 02:43:59.627]  The reality is, you're safer today than at almost any time in the modern era.
[02:43:59.627 --> 02:44:03.428]  From getting shot, stabbed, robbed, or any other crime.
[02:44:03.428 --> 02:44:04.509]  Except hoodwinked.
[02:44:04.509 --> 02:44:06.269]  Hoodwinking is up.
[02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:10.670]  Regardless of how you feel, you are safer.
[02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:13.431]  Why is it that you're safer, but you don't feel safer?
[02:44:14.127 --> 02:44:18.250]  With all this air time, the press and the politicians fill you with fear and anxiety.
[02:44:18.250 --> 02:44:21.312]  It is all meant to show you why you need them.
[02:44:21.312 --> 02:44:24.494]  If you know you're not in as much danger, then you're not as afraid.
[02:44:24.494 --> 02:44:35.501]  And if you're not as afraid, you may decide to go play kickball with the kids while you queue up some burgers and dogs, rather than watching CNN or Senator Worthless tell you why you should give them more time, money, and power.
[02:44:36.281 --> 02:44:42.024]  As to mass shootings, or mass killings of any kind, they have always been extremely rare.
[02:44:42.024 --> 02:44:46.666]  You have the same chance of being killed in a mass shooting as you do being killed by lightning.
[02:44:46.666 --> 02:44:49.588]  You walk around scared of a lightning death strike all day?
[02:44:49.588 --> 02:44:53.250]  If your answer is yes, then I have three terrifying words.
[02:44:53.250 --> 02:44:54.130]  Flesh.
[02:44:54.130 --> 02:44:54.670]  Eating.
[02:44:54.670 --> 02:44:55.351]  Bacteria.
[02:44:55.931 --> 02:45:05.674]  You are two and a half times more likely to be eaten to death by a microscopic zombie bacteria than you are to get killed by a mass shooter or killed by lightning.
[02:45:05.674 --> 02:45:16.277]  And forget plane travel, you are twice as likely to die in a plane crash as you are by flesh-eating bacteria, which is already two and a half times more deadly than getting killed by a mass shooter!
[02:45:16.277 --> 02:45:19.738]  Five times less safe on a plane!
[02:45:19.738 --> 02:45:24.520]  I wonder what the percentage is that I'll die in a fiery plane crash.
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:30.422]  And that's five times larger than my chance of getting killed by a mass shooter!
[02:45:30.422 --> 02:45:33.823]  And the hysteria over school safety.
[02:45:33.823 --> 02:45:36.864]  Schools are about the safest place on planet Earth.
[02:45:36.864 --> 02:45:40.926]  Again, less eating bacteria, more deadly.
[02:45:40.926 --> 02:45:45.148]  Here's the most deadly part of you and your kid's day.
[02:45:45.148 --> 02:45:49.909]  You're on your way to meet up with friends, but you can't seem to get anywhere quickly.
[02:45:49.909 --> 02:45:52.891]  You don't want your friends to be annoyed, so you text.
[02:45:52.891 --> 02:45:53.571]  You're on your way.
[02:46:01.601 --> 02:46:08.246]  Driving your kid to school is 47,000% more deadly than any risk they may have being at school.
[02:46:08.246 --> 02:46:11.829]  Law rules don't hinder lightning, nor do they hinder psychos.
[02:46:11.829 --> 02:46:16.893]  Gun regulations have had zero impact on mass shootings because psychos don't care about rules.
[02:46:16.893 --> 02:46:18.595]  It's why they're psychos.
[02:46:18.595 --> 02:46:20.356]  Lanza and the Joker used a gun.
[02:46:20.356 --> 02:46:22.658]  McVeigh used a fertilizer bomb.
[02:46:23.138 --> 02:46:33.105]  Andrew Kehoe blew up an elementary school in Bath Township, Michigan in 1927, killing 38 children and 6 adults with a fistful of dynamite.
[02:46:33.105 --> 02:46:36.988]  The point is, you can't regulate suicidal psychopaths.
[02:46:36.988 --> 02:46:40.170]  We have always had them, and we will continue to have them.
[02:46:40.170 --> 02:46:42.132]  Just like cockroaches.
[02:46:42.132 --> 02:46:51.519]  Now I don't know about you, but the idea that I'm just gonna sit here and bleed at the mercy of some punk till 911 decides to show up and rescue me ain't very badass.
[02:46:52.563 --> 02:46:56.425]  A well-armed populace keeps the armed and unarmed much safer.
[02:46:56.425 --> 02:47:04.189]  Not only is it proven by my tsunami of actual facts, but also clearly demonstrated by my lady in split-screen.
[02:47:04.189 --> 02:47:06.551]  Now that's badass.
[02:47:06.551 --> 02:47:12.894]  Whether it's a violent gang, a domestic abuser, a rioting mob, or a psychopathic crazy,
[02:47:16.502 --> 02:47:21.405]  I like my chances much better with the most powerful handgun in the world.
[02:47:21.405 --> 02:47:25.787]  Or, the gun from Predator.
[02:47:25.787 --> 02:47:31.750]  Payback time.
[02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:36.833]  Rather than depending on Big Brother to keep me safe, I am Badass Baby.
[02:47:36.833 --> 02:47:37.653]  Because reloading is stupid.
[02:47:37.653 --> 02:47:39.855]  Let's show my Big Brother how it's gonna be around here.
[02:47:40.994 --> 02:47:51.678]  Finally, for the mockers who think government tyranny is off the table, I ask them, isn't it the government holding the leash of that German Shepherd and pulling the trigger on that fire hose?
[02:47:51.678 --> 02:48:02.563]  Is it not tyrannous to force people to go fight in a war where you are sprayed with cancer causing Agent Orange while you march from village to village setting the country on fire for no real reason?
[02:48:03.363 --> 02:48:07.705]  Is it tyrannous to torture, spy, and intimidate innocent people?
[02:48:07.705 --> 02:48:10.186]  That seems fairly tyrannous to me.
[02:48:10.186 --> 02:48:17.169]  Giving all the guns to the same people who do this to others and expecting that they won't do it to you doesn't sound very smart to me.
[02:48:17.169 --> 02:48:18.150]  And I'm just a baby.
[02:48:21.525 --> 02:48:28.907]  If we actually want to lower gun violence, we need to end the number one reason people get shot.
[02:48:28.907 --> 02:48:30.107]  The drug war.
[02:48:30.107 --> 02:48:34.909]  43 men and 6 women had their heads, hands, and feet cut off.
[02:48:34.909 --> 02:48:37.450]  You have 5 people killed here, 3 people killed here.
[02:48:37.450 --> 02:48:42.511]  The heavily armed police now have to attend gang funerals to prevent revenge killings.
[02:48:42.691 --> 02:48:49.134]  The 12-year-old Fort Worth boy was just standing outside Saturday when gunmen sprayed his Eastwood home with bullets.
[02:48:49.134 --> 02:48:53.235]  The Portland Triplex was a base for white supremacist gang members.
[02:48:53.235 --> 02:48:56.317]  You gotta shoot at people, you know, you gotta kill people.
[02:48:56.317 --> 02:49:00.238]  According to Jester, you name it, and they can supply it.
[02:49:00.238 --> 02:49:02.599]  Crystal.
[02:49:02.599 --> 02:49:03.620]  Cocaine.
[02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:08.141]  If you ask what supports MS, it's drug trafficking.
[02:49:08.141 --> 02:49:08.402]  Heroin.
[02:49:08.402 --> 02:49:11.043]  It has 10,000 foot soldiers in the U.S.
[02:49:11.043 --> 02:49:11.203]  We
[02:49:12.180 --> 02:49:17.282]  And they've taken all the guns in Mexico and they have the highest gun crown in the world.
[02:49:17.282 --> 02:49:20.863]  If you're a radio listener, the video has all the statistics on screen.
[02:49:38.010 --> 02:49:40.993]  Legalization of drugs is not about the drugs.
[02:49:40.993 --> 02:49:47.058]  It is about the gangsterism and terrorism that is supported by the illegal marketplace in this country.
[02:49:47.058 --> 02:49:51.741]  Stay peaceful, stay prosperous, and stay free.
[02:49:51.741 --> 02:49:54.884]  Now what's a baby gotta do to get a drink around here?
[02:49:54.884 --> 02:49:59.408]  Man!
[02:49:59.408 --> 02:50:01.049]  Alright folks, there's the video.
[02:50:01.049 --> 02:50:03.351]  It's got some more trailer on it.
[02:50:03.351 --> 02:50:05.353]  The full video is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:07.313 --> 02:50:10.776]  And PrisonPlanet.com, and it's great to wake up young people.
[02:50:10.776 --> 02:50:16.420]  A little bit of silliness in there, because it's a baby explaining to you how simple this is.
[02:50:16.420 --> 02:50:18.923]  Showing FBI's own statistics.
[02:50:18.923 --> 02:50:22.425]  And people always counter that by saying, well, the FBI, I mean, you believe the government?
[02:50:22.425 --> 02:50:23.887]  They've been getting those since the 20s.
[02:50:23.887 --> 02:50:29.011]  It's the most accurate statistics in the world, because it's gathered locally and compiled nationally and checked locally.

[02:51:30.968 --> 02:51:32.088]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:32.088 --> 02:51:36.570]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:36.570 --> 02:51:42.292]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:42.292 --> 02:51:45.873]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:52:08.493 --> 02:52:12.096]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[02:52:12.096 --> 02:52:15.779]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[02:52:15.779 --> 02:52:18.482]  While the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:52:18.482 --> 02:52:21.004]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[02:54:32.588 --> 02:54:35.831]  And I literally made it myself on a
[02:54:37.950 --> 02:54:39.131]  Well, what's that program called?
[02:54:39.131 --> 02:54:39.791]  Photoshop.
[02:54:39.791 --> 02:54:42.772]  That's why it looks so simple, but it's actually iconic.
[02:54:42.772 --> 02:54:44.253]  There's that shirt.
[02:54:44.253 --> 02:54:46.354]  This should be the best seller ever.
[02:54:46.354 --> 02:54:50.976]  I pretty much designed it, and one of our great graphic people come up with it, you know, the actual look.
[02:54:51.897 --> 02:54:59.145]  And they got one that says InfoWars.com with a Molon Labe symbol, and one that just says Molon Labe and InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:54:59.145 --> 02:55:00.666]  And I'm really proud of it.
[02:55:00.666 --> 02:55:02.568]  This version is in kind of a gold.
[02:55:02.568 --> 02:55:06.232]  We're going to come out with one in gray as well, but it's on a black shirt.
[02:55:06.232 --> 02:55:08.354]  It's available at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:09.415 --> 02:55:25.475]  Store.com but if you want to find all the Made in America stuff go to madein1776.com and it takes you right to the sub page and we have the new made by US veterans owned by a Navy SEAL the .50 caliber bullet that's had the powder taken out that's a bottle breacher
[02:55:26.772 --> 02:55:35.774]  Great gift and that goes to support veterans, a lot of them, well all of them actually, combat veterans, a lot of them wounded and disabled, you name it.
[02:55:35.774 --> 02:55:37.715]  So it's a good Americana project.
[02:55:37.715 --> 02:55:39.675]  They're making a lot of these by the way.
[02:55:39.675 --> 02:55:44.777]  We're not the only ones that sell these, but they're custom and they say 1776 worldwide.
[02:55:44.777 --> 02:55:48.057]  That's available in Madein1776.com.
[02:55:48.057 --> 02:55:50.258]  There was a bunch of news I meant to get to that I haven't.
[02:55:52.369 --> 02:55:58.173]  Haven't covered yet, but you know, in the interest of going to your phone calls, I'll do a little bit of overdrive and regroup and cover some of those I haven't hit.
[02:55:58.173 --> 02:56:01.075]  Let's go to Roger in Canada, who's been holding patiently.
[02:56:01.075 --> 02:56:02.056]  Roger, you're on the air.
[02:56:02.056 --> 02:56:03.117]  Welcome.
[02:56:03.117 --> 02:56:04.458]  Hi, Alex.
[02:56:04.458 --> 02:56:05.218]  How are you?
[02:56:05.218 --> 02:56:06.819]  I'm doing pretty good, buddy.
[02:56:06.819 --> 02:56:07.220]  Good.
[02:56:07.220 --> 02:56:11.062]  I love you, and I love your honesty and vigor.
[02:56:11.062 --> 02:56:13.364]  And just a few points.
[02:56:13.364 --> 02:56:17.387]  But you, Carco, I bought a few of his books.
[02:56:17.387 --> 02:56:20.529]  I've read them, and I have a lot of respect for him.
[02:56:20.529 --> 02:56:21.830]  And I think you should have them on.
[02:56:23.134 --> 02:56:26.216]  We're going to reach out to him and do a friendly interview.
[02:56:26.216 --> 02:56:36.404]  That would be great, because I think, for one thing, he's a really accomplished mathematician, and he's not a meteorologist, but I'm sure he can work the data as good as anybody.
[02:56:36.404 --> 02:56:39.927]  I know, but I mean, do you think that global warming is real?
[02:56:39.927 --> 02:56:43.469]  Well, I'll tell you, I do, and I'll tell you why.
[02:56:47.509 --> 02:56:51.672]  There's probably about 5 billion cars burning fuel in the world.
[02:56:51.672 --> 02:56:52.012]  Sure.
[02:56:52.012 --> 02:57:01.178]  Multiply that by the diameter of all the exhaust pipes, and then all the electric motors and so on, they're burning.
[02:57:01.178 --> 02:57:06.682]  Plus, uh, all life creates heat on this planet, and we need it.
[02:57:06.682 --> 02:57:07.743]  That's not what I'm saying.
[02:57:07.743 --> 02:57:08.663]  We need it.
[02:57:08.663 --> 02:57:10.224]  Now, I am a little nervous.
[02:57:10.224 --> 02:57:12.666]  We need heat though, that is true.
[02:57:12.666 --> 02:57:17.189]  Now, the thing is, is there's a very delicate
[02:57:19.540 --> 02:57:23.921]  I know, but they've done the equations.
[02:57:23.921 --> 02:57:27.082]  Volcanoes put out a lot more than humans ever could.
[02:57:27.082 --> 02:57:29.582]  On record, there's a mass ejection in Java right now.
[02:57:29.582 --> 02:57:31.262]  They're evacuating Indonesia.
[02:57:31.262 --> 02:57:32.162]  Here's the issue.
[02:57:32.162 --> 02:57:36.183]  What about all the chemtrailing, the geoengineering, the weather modification?
[02:57:36.183 --> 02:57:38.884]  I'm not saying there's not strange weather here and there.
[02:57:38.884 --> 02:57:46.705]  My issue is how does moving our factories from here to China, where they're ten times more dirty, literally, going to help the atmosphere if it's one atmosphere?
[02:57:47.483 --> 02:57:48.464]  Well, I agree with that.
[02:57:48.464 --> 02:57:53.449]  The chemtrailing, though, in the last few years here has been horrid.
[02:57:53.449 --> 02:57:59.035]  In the summertime, every time the sun tries to peek out and there's no clouds, they're spraying like crazy.
[02:58:00.556 --> 02:58:02.677]  I wonder who's paying that bill, by the way.
[02:58:19.952 --> 02:58:22.393]  I mean, he ran the whole operation, from what I know.
[02:58:22.393 --> 02:58:24.094]  I accused him of that on TV, too.
[02:58:24.094 --> 02:58:27.535]  I said, from what I've read in the British papers, he ran the whole operation.
[02:58:27.535 --> 02:58:29.295]  Stop acting like you're goody two-shoes.
[02:58:29.295 --> 02:58:33.457]  By the way, he has armed bodyguards behind a gated community in L.A.
[02:58:34.577 --> 02:58:36.039]  What a coward!
[02:58:36.039 --> 02:58:38.342]  This guy has armed bodyguards.
[02:58:38.342 --> 02:58:41.767]  He's worth tens of millions of dollars, but you and I, we can't have guns!
[02:58:41.767 --> 02:58:43.189]  You jerk!
[02:58:43.189 --> 02:58:45.232]  You punk!
[02:58:45.232 --> 02:58:47.856]  You coward!
[02:58:47.856 --> 02:58:49.879]  I kicked your butt on air and you know it, Redcoat!
[02:58:51.081 --> 02:59:00.169]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:00.169 --> 02:59:08.576]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:08.576 --> 02:59:13.460]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:13.460 --> 02:59:16.843]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[02:59:18.544 --> 02:59:19.105]  We're good to go.
[02:59:34.420 --> 02:59:38.904]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:38.904 --> 02:59:42.307]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:42.307 --> 02:59:48.613]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:48.613 --> 02:59:52.056]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:52.056 --> 02:59:53.597]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.597 --> 02:59:55.659]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.659 --> 02:59:58.862]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.004 --> 03:00:10.849]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.849 --> 03:00:12.431]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.431 --> 03:00:13.973]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.973 --> 03:00:18.177]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.177 --> 03:00:22.241]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.471 --> 03:00:38.976]  You know, one in four Americans thought that the Sun orbited the Earth in a new national survey, National Science Foundation, and a federal judge has confused the Declaration of Independence with the Constitution and court ruling.
[03:00:38.976 --> 03:00:43.557]  She said, our Constitution declares that all men are created equal, she wrote.
[03:00:43.557 --> 03:00:49.539]  You know, the judge may have gotten a word wrong, but for me, and reading a lot of high-level
[03:00:50.518 --> 03:00:53.199]  Federal rulings from even over a hundred years ago.
[03:00:53.199 --> 03:00:57.421]  The Declaration of Independence is as important as the Constitution.
[03:00:57.421 --> 03:01:02.763]  It is the founding document and really is the proto-Constitution.
[03:01:02.763 --> 03:01:11.107]  And is the spirit of the law to interpret the federal law that is the Constitution, the big federal law, written in all caps.
[03:01:11.107 --> 03:01:12.628]  Not all this made-up bureaucracy.
[03:01:12.628 --> 03:01:15.329]  The federal judge confused it.
[03:01:17.233 --> 03:01:25.047]  Thursday night in a court ruling which overturned Virginia's ban on same-sex marriages.
[03:01:25.047 --> 03:01:25.768]  Here's the issue.
[03:01:25.768 --> 03:01:29.074]  The ancient covenant of marriage
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:32.302]  Is between a man and a woman.
[03:01:32.302 --> 03:01:36.424]  Civil unions and stuff, I mean that people, whatever, do whatever you want, I'm a libertarian.
[03:01:36.424 --> 03:01:46.671]  It is an attack on the family, it is an attack from the way they're launching it, on the institution of marriage and family law and how it's all set up, and that's screwed up as well.
[03:01:46.671 --> 03:01:49.953]  You don't need to, it's just out of control, folks.
[03:01:49.953 --> 03:01:54.456]  I mean marriage, all over the world, every culture, they don't know why, they don't know how the culture's touched.
[03:01:54.456 --> 03:01:56.978]  They go back thousands of years, every culture, the woman wears white,
[03:01:57.984 --> 03:02:03.785]  The male tends to dress up all fancy, and the father of the woman brings her up.
[03:02:03.785 --> 03:02:05.266]  I mean, it's tribal, folks.
[03:02:05.266 --> 03:02:08.286]  This is as ancient as anything humans do.
[03:02:08.286 --> 03:02:12.327]  Keep your hands off of it, okay?
[03:02:12.327 --> 03:02:14.888]  I mean, it's that simple.
[03:02:14.888 --> 03:02:17.348]  It's an attack on an ancient ritual.
[03:02:17.348 --> 03:02:18.469]  It's our ritual.
[03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:20.869]  You can go have yours.
[03:02:20.869 --> 03:02:22.889]  That makes me really get a headache.
[03:02:22.889 --> 03:02:24.850]  But she did interpret it wrongly.
[03:02:26.445 --> 03:02:30.486]  To try to say that they can have the same sex marriages.
[03:02:30.486 --> 03:02:33.687]  Let's go ahead and take a phone call before I have a coughing fit.
[03:02:33.687 --> 03:02:37.489]  Terry in Canada, you're on the air.
[03:02:37.489 --> 03:02:39.850]  Come on down, Terry.
[03:02:39.850 --> 03:02:42.991]  Alright, Terry's punched out.
[03:02:42.991 --> 03:02:46.632]  Let's talk to Dave in Colorado.
[03:02:46.632 --> 03:02:48.152]  Dave, you're the last caller we have time for.
[03:02:48.152 --> 03:02:49.093]  Sorry for the others.
[03:02:49.093 --> 03:02:51.193]  Go ahead.
[03:02:51.193 --> 03:02:52.114]  Hi, Alex.
[03:02:52.114 --> 03:02:53.834]  Hello.
[03:02:53.834 --> 03:02:55.315]  Hello, I'm Mr. Red.
[03:02:55.315 --> 03:02:55.815]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:02:58.582 --> 03:03:17.953]  I just wanted to quickly respond to an earlier caller request for, you know, where should he start if he wanted to start researching the kinds of things that we've been talking about.
[03:03:17.953 --> 03:03:23.276]  And if you don't mind, I just wanted to say that, real quickly, I'm a...
[03:03:23.954 --> 03:03:27.937]  I'm a former professor of anthropology at the University of Maryland.
[03:03:27.937 --> 03:03:31.859]  I used to show Terror Storm to my students.
[03:03:31.859 --> 03:03:36.142]  Oh, wow!
[03:03:36.142 --> 03:03:41.966]  And also show David Ray Griffin his University of Wisconsin speech.
[03:03:41.966 --> 03:03:42.386]  That's excellent.
[03:03:42.386 --> 03:03:43.467]  You've got a lot of courage.
[03:03:43.467 --> 03:03:45.268]  You get in trouble for that.
[03:03:45.268 --> 03:03:45.868]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:45.868 --> 03:03:46.249]  Certainly.
[03:03:46.249 --> 03:03:52.593]  I used to have bans from Homeland Security
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:53.561]  I don't
[03:04:10.382 --> 03:04:15.487]  A model plane hovering over my head!
[03:04:15.487 --> 03:04:22.953]  By the way, about five years ago at a demonstration in D.C., they said they saw fake dragonflies over them and they went, oh, you're crazy.
[03:04:22.953 --> 03:04:24.635]  Three years later, they declassified.
[03:04:24.635 --> 03:04:30.900]  They were real drone dragonflies with video cameras and microphones spying on people.
[03:04:30.900 --> 03:04:31.641]  So, yeah.
[03:04:31.641 --> 03:04:33.382]  And look what you went through to tell the truth.
[03:04:33.382 --> 03:04:35.184]  I wish I had more time to talk to you.
[03:04:35.184 --> 03:04:35.945]  Closing comments.
[03:04:37.461 --> 03:04:44.244]  Okay, um, here are a couple of things I'd like to recommend to get started.
[03:04:44.244 --> 03:04:47.006]  Political policing by Martha Huggins.
[03:04:47.006 --> 03:04:50.487]  Editorial space by J. Cutchfield Street.
[03:04:50.487 --> 03:04:56.410]  The Guatemalan military pride... Hey, why don't you write an article for us, even in a nom de plume, professor?
[03:04:56.410 --> 03:04:57.691]  Send it to us, we'll publish it.
[03:04:57.691 --> 03:04:58.671]  I'm out of time.
[03:04:58.671 --> 03:05:00.052]  Back Sunday, 4 to 6.
