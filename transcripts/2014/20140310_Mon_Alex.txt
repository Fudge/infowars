[00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.831]  Coast to Coast.
[00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:04.513]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.253 --> 00:00:08.476]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:15.245]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:16.966]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:18.787]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:20.247]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:21.928]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:26.210]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.832]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:51.104]  Well, the architect of BozoCare, Ezekiel Emanuel, Dr. Death, Dr. Death Panel, he's come out and said, you don't need a doctor, you just need to go to a kiosk.
[00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:58.866]  Remember, Jacari Jackson went to Walmart and they had some robot literally diagnose him with diabetes and say he was a beast or whatever?
[00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:02.828]  Even though he's in great shape?
[00:01:04.315 --> 00:01:07.256]  I mean, that's the type of stuff that's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:11.397]  Walmart robo-doctor kiosk promotes Obamacare.
[00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:16.859]  Elysium-like machine tells Jakari Jackson he's obese and should sign up for Obamacare.
[00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.600]  And so we're going to show that report along with that with Stefan Molyneux.
[00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:25.777]  Coming up in the next segment, here's a big story we're going to be covering.
[00:01:25.837 --> 00:01:30.199]  CIA employees face new inquiry amid clash on detention program.
[00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:33.120]  Turns out the CIA was spying on the Senate.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.640]  Well, of course they were.
[00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:36.681]  So that's all coming up.
[00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:45.104]  Right now, let's go back to your calls on the IRS taking the fifth, even though they tell you you can't, on your tax filings.
[00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.726]  But hey, you know, four legs good, two legs better.
[00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:51.992]  They're on the animal farm.
[00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.173]  Joe in California, you're on the air.
[00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:54.653]  Go ahead.
[00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:57.374]  Hello, Alex.
[00:01:57.794 --> 00:01:58.214]  Hey, buddy.
[00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:00.095]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:01.616]  I'm doing alright.
[00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:02.977]  Just doing a little radio show.
[00:02:05.238 --> 00:02:05.518]  Awesome.
[00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:14.282]  Well, it's just another example of how it's one set of rules for them and a different set of rules for all the rest of us slaves.
[00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:19.079]  Well, slaves is the operative word, because it is an unconstitutional tax.
[00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.862]  It is in the Communist Manifesto to have an income tax.
[00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:25.305]  The average American didn't pay an income tax until 1951.
[00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:29.128]  I mean, this is an alien thing.
[00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:34.213]  I'll never forget that Ron Paul was on CNN once, and, what'll we do if we get rid of the income tax?
[00:02:34.513 --> 00:02:35.634]  What'll build the government?
[00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:35.934]  What run?
[00:02:35.974 --> 00:02:38.457]  He goes, this Capitol was built before we had an income tax.
[00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:41.497]  The income tax doesn't run the country.
[00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:43.179]  It goes to interest on the debt to the Federal Reserve.
[00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.201]  But hey, don't let facts get in the way of it.
[00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:46.062]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:02:46.102 --> 00:02:46.362]  I'm sorry.
[00:02:46.402 --> 00:02:46.802]  Make a point.
[00:02:47.924 --> 00:02:49.986]  Well, you know, here's the thing.
[00:02:50.586 --> 00:03:02.439]  If they're going to continue to ignore us and implement things that we don't want, like an example, Obamacare, you know, you fully implement that when we told you we don't want it.
[00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:04.617]  We're not going to pay taxes anymore.
[00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:07.481]  Lifeblood of this whole system is money.
[00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:10.144]  If they don't have money, they can't function.
[00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:13.509]  They can't send troops in to attack if they don't have money to pay them.
[00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:14.851]  So, cut them off.
[00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:18.586]  Very well said.
[00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:19.307]  No, I agree.
[00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:27.895]  And withdraw consent from the system, speak out against it, take our moral authority away from them, point out that literally we're run by offshore banks, and it's over.
[00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:30.038]  The occupation will begin to fall.
[00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:31.860]  They want us poor.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.901]  The globalists admit this.
[00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:38.566]  They set the economy up to make it artificially scarce because they don't want us being, quote, uppity.
[00:03:38.707 --> 00:03:39.447]  I appreciate your call.
[00:03:40.328 --> 00:03:48.294]  By the way, Paul Watson was on for a long time last night on The Savage Nation with Michael Savage breaking down the whole Ukraine situation.
[00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:57.721]  It's an excellent in-depth talk by two men, one in the UK, one in San Francisco, California, on what happened there.
[00:03:57.842 --> 00:03:58.782]  It's a fascinating interview.
[00:03:59.143 --> 00:04:00.624]  I was listening to it this morning and was almost...
[00:04:01.244 --> 00:04:01.765]  Late to work.
[00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:03.528]  I wasn't really late to work, but I want to get here two hours early.
[00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:10.701]  I only got here an hour before showtime because I listened while I was getting ready this morning doing research to the whole interview and it's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:12.764]  Paul Joseph Watson and...
[00:04:14.178 --> 00:04:22.621]  Michael Savage, really discussing hardcore issues, breaking the left-right paradigm, drilling into the geopolitical machinations of the New World Order.
[00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:29.804]  Stefan Molyneux, philosopher, futurist, best-selling author, will be joining us, hailing from Canada.
[00:04:29.844 --> 00:04:32.685]  He's going to be in studio in the next segment, a little bit into the next hour with us.
[00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:35.887]  But I'm sure we'll be able to talk about the IRS with you guys, Steve and Robert, and
[00:04:36.747 --> 00:04:42.971]  Fred, and Dave, and Mike, and many others, we will be getting to all of you with him as well.
[00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:51.657]  But I'm gonna first cover the statist religion, which he agrees is more dangerous than a lot of people that are controlled by establishment religion.
[00:04:52.137 --> 00:04:56.580]  And again, I'm a religious person, I'm a spiritual person, but I'm not an establishment religion person.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.402]  But I don't get mad at folks that say, I can't see it, I don't believe it.
[00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:05.879]  What I get mad at is atheists that tend to replace one thing with a state-made God.
[00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:09.822]  And he agrees that those atheists are dangerous.
[00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:18.788]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:05:18.848 --> 00:05:26.953]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:05:27.233 --> 00:05:31.956]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:38.840]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.985]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:05:46.085 --> 00:05:52.949]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:57.472]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:05:57.592 --> 00:06:00.834]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:06:00.974 --> 00:06:07.098]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:06:07.278 --> 00:06:09.420]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:23.870]  Simple.
[00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.432]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:34.216]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:50.527]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:06:50.787 --> 00:06:52.648]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:06:52.748 --> 00:06:55.009]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.210]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.813]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:07.315]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:09.336]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:14.138]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:17.300]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.684]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:07:23.024 --> 00:07:24.686]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:07:24.946 --> 00:07:26.287]  We are what we eat.
[00:07:26.587 --> 00:07:30.930]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.173]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:07:35.473 --> 00:07:37.774]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:07:38.034 --> 00:07:43.937]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[00:07:44.257 --> 00:07:46.979]  To learn more, visit InfoWarsHealth.com.

[00:08:27.603 --> 00:08:32.305]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:44.070]  Every time that I look in the mirror, all these lines in my face get clearer.
[00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:45.131]  The past is
[00:09:01.172 --> 00:09:10.295]  Stefan Molyneux is with us about 10-15 minutes into the next hour and we'll have open phones throughout that third hour coming up interspersed with news.
[00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:29.863]  Stefan is here in Texas going around on tour best-selling author from Canada and I wanted to get him in here to talk about his futurist view on the world and where things are going but to also go over some of the contemporary news that is unfolding in the world today.
[00:09:30.956 --> 00:09:36.786]  We also have government-run health care, where now they promise no new regulations on doctors.
[00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:38.348]  It is 155,000
[00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.991]  And the coming changes are vast.
[00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:55.775]  The number of codes will explode from 17,000 under the current system to 155,000 under the new one, according to the Centers for Medical and Medicine Services.
[00:09:56.335 --> 00:10:03.398]  And it's designed to totally destroy all three independent medical centers, doctors, you name it, all the smaller clinics and hospitals.
[00:10:03.438 --> 00:10:10.561]  It was written by big hospitals and foreign insurance companies and offshore insurance companies to totally shut everything down but them.
[00:10:11.121 --> 00:10:18.183]  It's a monopoly takeover to take you from 40 hours to less than 30 hours a week to not cover pre-existing conditions.
[00:10:18.883 --> 00:10:21.924]  Government being involved with corporations screwed up our health care.
[00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:26.046]  If you think it was already bad, it was the best 50 years ago here in the U.S.
[00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:27.246]  Hands down, not debated.
[00:10:27.686 --> 00:10:29.567]  Royalty came here from around the world.
[00:10:30.087 --> 00:10:31.507]  Now it's going to be the worst.
[00:10:31.687 --> 00:10:34.228]  So the weekly standard has those numbers.
[00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:39.290]  We're also going to be getting into the architect of it.
[00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.272]  Ezekiel Emanuel, we have the clip coming up.
[00:10:42.332 --> 00:10:46.054]  He says, we'll get to it at the bottom of the hour, you don't even need a doctor.
[00:10:46.775 --> 00:10:47.515]  It's like Cuba.
[00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:49.717]  I mean, you've got plenty of doctors and health care.
[00:10:49.977 --> 00:10:53.660]  You just get a cane if your knees are bad or a cane if you're going blind.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.382]  I mean, just a cane is the answer.
[00:10:56.842 --> 00:10:59.744]  So everybody's like, I want the health care like England.
[00:11:00.304 --> 00:11:05.888]  You ever watch the parliamentary stuff on C-SPAN where they admit 18 months to get a broken leg fixed and stuff?
[00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:12.031]  Wow, you folks, you're really in for a rude awakening, just like we told you Obamacare would increase your prices.
[00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:18.234]  We're going to get into this move to disarm people as well, and the whole climate change push for taxation.
[00:11:18.874 --> 00:11:21.775]  Just a bunch of news with our guest.
[00:11:22.135 --> 00:11:24.436]  Hillary Clinton calls Vladimir Putin Hitler.
[00:11:24.796 --> 00:11:25.697]  Texts one to no one.
[00:11:26.617 --> 00:11:28.618]  This is all coming up with Stefan Molyneux.
[00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:33.640]  And again, he is the founder and host of Free Domain Radio.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:40.747]  It's one of the largest and most popular philosophical shows in the world with more than 2,400 podcasts, 10 books and 50 million downloads.
[00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:41.408]  That's an old bio.
[00:11:41.448 --> 00:11:42.809]  It's more than that now.
[00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:45.412]  And he spread the cause of liberty, philosophy to listeners throughout the world.
[00:11:46.113 --> 00:11:50.778]  And I'm not going to go over his whole background, but prior to that, he was a thriving career and software entrepreneur.
[00:11:51.238 --> 00:11:51.398]  I don't
[00:12:06.135 --> 00:12:13.659]  And he's author of two novels, Revolutions and the God of Atheists, as well as eight non-fiction books on relationships, government, and religion.
[00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:16.400]  And freedomainradio.com is his site.
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.661]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:21.923]  If you just joined us with Infowars.com, you can follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[00:12:22.183 --> 00:12:25.005]  Before I go anywhere, I want to thank you for coming to join us.
[00:12:25.465 --> 00:12:26.466]  Oh, it's my pleasure.
[00:12:26.506 --> 00:12:27.487]  Thank you so much for having me.
[00:12:27.527 --> 00:12:37.957]  I'm actually in town for the Texas Bitcoin Conference tomorrow, and it's a real pleasure to... I mean, we've done a couple of shows remotely, so it's very nice to be able to do a show face-to-face.
[00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:39.419]  Well, it's good to have you here, brother.
[00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:42.922]  Now, there's so much I want to throw out, but I want to cover the waterfront here.
[00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:57.767]  Quantifying, because I know you're a smart guy when it comes to history, that's why I like having you on, because I'm somewhat of a history novice myself, looking at the wider spectrum, I believe undoubtedly we're in the bottom of a very decadent phase in the cycle, but coming out of that could be renaissance.
[00:12:58.148 --> 00:12:59.389]  I want to see A, if you agree with that, B,
[00:13:00.891 --> 00:13:11.780]  What do you expect the statists, who are the biggest religion in the world, versus one of the other largest religions, the liberty lovers, you know, who just are into humans and human empowerment, call it a religion if you want.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.981]  Point is, humans tend to organize in that fashion.
[00:13:14.682 --> 00:13:20.086]  What do we do, and what's going to happen as the statists discover it's not delivering, it's a fraud, it's a lie?
[00:13:20.426 --> 00:13:22.928]  They tend to double down and call for 100% taxation.
[00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:25.671]  The taxing class tends to start engaging in tax fraud.
[00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:28.793]  Where you have a $3,000 truck and they say, we say it's worth $30,000.
[00:13:29.173 --> 00:13:33.136]  That's not happening to friends of mine who have like 93 Chevy Silverados.
[00:13:33.216 --> 00:13:36.338]  And then the state just says, sorry, pay that.
[00:13:36.378 --> 00:13:37.318]  We're not giving you your sticker.
[00:13:37.979 --> 00:13:38.879]  This is happening everywhere.
[00:13:39.139 --> 00:13:41.781]  What's going to happen as they double down historically?
[00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:43.042]  What comes out of that?
[00:13:43.362 --> 00:13:53.049]  What are they going to go through with the singularity stacked on top of it, with all the societal crises and all the things, superbugs and like everything coming to a head?
[00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:54.830]  What do you expect to happen?
[00:13:55.762 --> 00:13:57.583]  Well, violence, of course, is an addiction.
[00:13:57.904 --> 00:14:00.225]  And most addictions have to run their course.
[00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:06.971]  You know, most people who get involved in addictive behavior end up escalating and escalating and escalating.
[00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:14.356]  And our focus on trying to use government violence to solve complex social problems, I think you're right, it's in its death throes.
[00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:15.697]  I mean, how much further can it go?
[00:14:15.777 --> 00:14:21.682]  I mean, taxation, if you count debt and so on, and you count all this scaled taxes all embedded in your income,
[00:14:22.082 --> 00:14:22.702]  We're good to go.
[00:14:42.777 --> 00:14:57.589]  The idea that you can solve social problems voluntarily and peacefully and virtuously and cooperatively is an Enlightenment idea that got eclipsed by the progressive movement, the communist movement, the socialist movement of the 20s where a whole bunch of people... Who claims the moral high ground.
[00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:58.770]  Yeah, yeah, claim the moral high ground.
[00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:59.970]  We can solve poverty.
[00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.191]  We can solve illness.
[00:15:01.231 --> 00:15:02.973]  We can make everybody educated.
[00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:04.694]  We can teach the poor.
[00:15:04.794 --> 00:15:07.556]  And now, I mean, the whole thing is completely unraveling.
[00:15:07.917 --> 00:15:09.378]  You don't see a lot of calls
[00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:17.283]  Outside of Obamacare, which I think was pretty unique in that the Democrats just had all the cards in one moment in history, you don't see a lot of call for big government programs.
[00:15:17.503 --> 00:15:24.328]  You don't actually even see that much of a call for more government spending on things like education because they're spending so much and getting so little result.
[00:15:24.368 --> 00:15:29.211]  I think people are recognizing that more money, more power is not going to solve the problem.
[00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:31.052]  And then people are beginning to look for alternatives.
[00:15:31.092 --> 00:15:37.056]  It's still early, but we have to be out there saying no, coercion is never going to work to solve these problems.
[00:15:37.517 --> 00:15:39.718]  Coercion is like a drug for a tumor.
[00:15:39.718 --> 00:15:41.318]  And there's not any economists that deny that now?
[00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:08.306]  You're right, we've reached the point now where 10 years ago we'd talk about this, oh, that doesn't exist.
[00:16:08.826 --> 00:16:12.527]  Now, it's like, okay, you're right, it's going on, but what are you going to do about it?
[00:16:12.808 --> 00:16:15.108]  Well, the stimulus package, the whole Keynesian thing, right?
[00:16:15.128 --> 00:16:20.470]  Like, oh, well, there's a dip in the demand, which is the result of prior Fed policies and pushing everyone into a home policies.
[00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.491]  And people say, well, the stimulus package is going to even things out and then it's going to grow again.
[00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:31.253]  Well, they had the largest stimulus package in the history of the known universe, and the economy is still a complete mess.
[00:16:31.393 --> 00:16:36.235]  So I think people are no longer... They're hitting the gas pedal, but there's no gas getting to the engine.
[00:16:36.275 --> 00:16:38.695]  I think people are recognizing it's just not working anymore.
[00:16:38.775 --> 00:16:45.698]  And I hope that people are beginning to look at voluntary options for solving some very deep social problems, half of which are natural to the human condition.
[00:16:45.718 --> 00:16:53.120]  Sure, but what do you expect to happen in the interim as those that follow the god of the state discover that the golden calf isn't going to deliver?
[00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:56.448]  Well, you say some of them are going to double down.
[00:16:56.468 --> 00:16:59.189]  And those people we have to call out on a moral basis.
[00:16:59.229 --> 00:17:01.010]  I think the practical argument has been won.
[00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:09.274]  You know, libertarians have been saying for 40, 50 years, or if you count classical liberals, 250 years, that the state is not going to produce anything good in the long run.
[00:17:09.534 --> 00:17:13.336]  We've won the practical argument because the results are just so catastrophic around the world.
[00:17:13.336 --> 00:17:14.136]  Alex Jefferson is right.
[00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:39.171]  We're creating an escalation of violence to solve complex problems.
[00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:40.213]  We've got to call them out morally.
[00:17:40.454 --> 00:17:44.605]  The practical argument has been won, but we need to hit them hard in the moral solar plexus, so to speak.
[00:17:45.953 --> 00:17:46.634]  I agree with you.
[00:17:46.654 --> 00:17:50.576]  Let me just throw a total wild card at you because I keep seeing this in the news.
[00:17:51.097 --> 00:18:00.044]  Every time I turn around, leaders in government and the people that are over the quote child porn investigations are reportedly involved in it.
[00:18:00.324 --> 00:18:01.144]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:04.167]  Why did number 10 cover up AIDS child porn arrest?
[00:18:04.507 --> 00:18:10.972]  Downing Street only confirms details when pressed by mail as further sex allegations against PM's friend emerge.
[00:18:10.992 --> 00:18:12.052]  Here's an example of government.
[00:18:12.493 --> 00:18:15.015]  Statistically, truancy officers and CPS
[00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:17.537]  People can look this up at the highest level of pedophilia.
[00:18:18.037 --> 00:18:21.660]  So the people that are over stopping it are the ones that are involved in it.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.862]  I mean right there proves the whole state argument.
[00:18:24.382 --> 00:18:25.023]  Why is that?
[00:18:25.043 --> 00:18:26.244]  I mean what is that?
[00:18:27.028 --> 00:18:29.390]  People who wish to do evil congregate to the state.
[00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:35.514]  I mean, this isn't just the BBC, this is the government-run, you have to pay the taxes for it whether you like it or not.
[00:18:35.554 --> 00:18:36.515]  A bunch of pedophiles, right?
[00:18:36.535 --> 00:18:37.195]  Yeah, a bunch of pedophiles.
[00:18:37.215 --> 00:18:41.018]  Just Jimmy Seville and all these people with like a 30-year pedophile ring going on up there.
[00:18:41.318 --> 00:18:47.063]  People in power are the people who want power, are the people who want to get over the rules they're imposing on others.
[00:18:47.583 --> 00:18:54.148]  I mean, did you read this John Kerry quote about how horrible it is to invade a sovereign country when he was talking about Putin and Ukraine?
[00:18:54.768 --> 00:18:58.289]  I mean, the level of hypocrisy shown by those in power is astounding.
[00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:02.631]  It's like watching two alcoholics scream, you're a drunk, at each other when they're both complete alcoholics.
[00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:10.734]  So, people who want to do great evil gravitate to where you're exempt from the moral rules and exempt from the law, which is at the top of the status apparatus.
[00:19:10.754 --> 00:19:14.876]  That's why expecting the state to save us from evil, the state is a giant magnet for evildoers.
[00:19:15.156 --> 00:19:18.397]  And it gives them the most possible power that you can have in this known universe.
[00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:24.521]  So it seems to me that if you want to do terrible things like rape children, yeah, gravitate towards the government.
[00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:32.868]  The SEC, during the financial crisis, the lead up to the financial crisis, the amount of pornography that was found on the SEC computers ran into the thousands.
[00:19:33.288 --> 00:19:40.414]  They had PowerPoint presentations of rampant pornography being developed and shown in the SEC, while they were supposed to be guarding everybody's financial interests.
[00:19:40.454 --> 00:19:45.898]  Well, you know, if you're into looking at porn at work, of course you want to go work for the government, because in the private sector you'd be tossed out.
[00:19:47.009 --> 00:20:01.685]  It's just amazing how disconnected they are, and really, historically, it's government, Nero, Caligula, the examples are Legion, that become delusional, announce their god, and then build pyramids and say, bring your children up here to be sacrificed to me, to show your ultimate service to them.
[00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:06.350]  And the whole world becomes a giant Jim Jones cult, drinking government Kool-Aid.
[00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:08.513]  We'll be right back with Stefan Molyneux.
[00:20:09.952 --> 00:20:11.053]  Attention gun owners.
[00:20:11.313 --> 00:20:16.015]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[00:20:16.115 --> 00:20:19.577]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[00:20:19.817 --> 00:20:21.979]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.
[00:20:22.199 --> 00:20:24.360]  Is civilian legal in all 50 states?
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.921]  Is 100% made in the USA?
[00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:30.643]  Is veteran owned and ships next business day for free?
[00:20:30.783 --> 00:20:33.325]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[00:20:36.406 --> 00:20:37.547]  Infidel Body Armor.

[00:20:39.748 --> 00:20:40.769]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:40.849 --> 00:20:45.172]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:45.352 --> 00:20:50.956]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:51.056 --> 00:20:54.419]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:54.639 --> 00:20:57.201]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:21:47.283 --> 00:21:52.709]  Supernatural Silver is the number one choice of thousands for improved health and immune system support.

[00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:16.431]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:22:16.531 --> 00:22:22.436]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:26.239]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals

[00:23:08.662 --> 00:23:11.243]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:11.503 --> 00:23:16.386]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:23:16.646 --> 00:23:24.450]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.054]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:33.098]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:33.238 --> 00:23:38.963]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:39.203 --> 00:23:41.986]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:23:42.366 --> 00:23:47.511]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:23:47.731 --> 00:23:55.838]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:24:18.883 --> 00:24:19.784]  We are back live.
[00:24:19.844 --> 00:24:21.064]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:21.204 --> 00:24:23.566]  Stefan Mullin is with us, I guess, 20 minutes to the next hour.
[00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:27.928]  We'll start taking your calls coming up here in about 20 minutes on any subject you'd like to discuss.
[00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:30.450]  IRS persecutions, you name it.
[00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:37.094]  Lois Lerner taking the fifth, even though the IRS tells American slaves they can't take the fifth on their tax forms.
[00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:39.895]  And then we're going to get into the fake global warming.
[00:24:39.915 --> 00:24:41.396]  It's Stefan Mullin and his take on that.
[00:24:41.416 --> 00:24:42.097]  The incredible.
[00:24:42.637 --> 00:24:45.940]  Anti-gun confiscation garbage that's going on.
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.982]  The victim disarmament that's going on is unprecedented.
[00:24:49.022 --> 00:24:53.626]  Now Bloomberg wants Facebook to not allow you to have pro-gun posts defending the Second Amendment.
[00:24:54.107 --> 00:24:56.088]  I mean, this is really unprecedented.
[00:24:56.108 --> 00:25:01.012]  The statists are now losing the intellectual battle, so they're moving towards censorship.
[00:25:01.332 --> 00:25:03.194]  That's coming up in the next long segment.
[00:25:03.554 --> 00:25:05.256]  This segment's only six minutes long.
[00:25:05.796 --> 00:25:08.198]  And, Stefan, I know you're a big geopolitical analyst.
[00:25:08.538 --> 00:25:10.040]  I wanted to get your take
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.721]  On the situation in the Crimea, in the Ukraine.
[00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:21.743]  Well, I guess the first thing to recognize is that up until 1953, the Ukraine was part of Russia and they still very much identify.
[00:25:21.763 --> 00:25:27.805]  I mean, the whole eastern half of the country speaks Russian and is very nationalistic, very Russian nationalistic.
[00:25:28.905 --> 00:25:30.086]  It is one of the most corrupt
[00:25:32.067 --> 00:25:34.068]  Autocracies in all of Europe.
[00:25:34.228 --> 00:25:36.330]  In fact, in all the world outside of Africa.
[00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.111]  I mean, the level of corruption is staggering.
[00:25:38.131 --> 00:25:38.791]  It's a mess.
[00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:40.212]  I mean, the amount of debt and so on.
[00:25:40.512 --> 00:25:42.093]  Now, they want to join the EU.
[00:25:42.754 --> 00:25:47.397]  A study came out, I shouldn't laugh because it's just tragic, but a study came out in, I think... Out of the fire, into the furnace.
[00:25:47.557 --> 00:25:56.307]  Yeah, I mean, the amount of corruption in the EU has been estimated conservatively as about the same size as the entire economy of Ukraine.
[00:25:56.607 --> 00:26:00.972]  So the idea that they're going to go to the EU to try and get away from corruption is completely mad.
[00:26:01.012 --> 00:26:02.473]  Yeah, it's out of the frying pan, into the fire.
[00:26:03.254 --> 00:26:09.899]  Now, of course, Russia has for many years been paying the Ukraine to store the black, sorry, the fourth fleet is in Crimea.
[00:26:10.179 --> 00:26:23.087]  And when in a time of instability, when they don't know which way the government is going to go, it seems to me, I don't know for sure, but it seems to me that Putin is simply saying, I need to go in and secure my fleet, because I don't know what's going to happen to the government.
[00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:31.113]  And this is exactly, I mean, if Turkey was about to be taken over, if America thought Turkey was about to be taken over by a communist government, they would move in to secure their bases.
[00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:32.834]  They would move in to secure their military assets.
[00:26:33.314 --> 00:26:36.176]  This is right on the Russian border, and used to be part of Russia.
[00:26:36.936 --> 00:26:41.900]  I'm not defending Russia, it's just the West is in there starting the whole thing, is my issue.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:49.945]  Yeah, and of course Russia, one of Putin's arguments is, look, he says, I stood behind America when they went into Iraq, which I disagreed with.
[00:26:50.505 --> 00:26:55.588]  When they wanted some of the Eastern Bloc countries to join EU and NATO, I didn't stand in the way.
[00:26:55.888 --> 00:26:57.489]  But, you know, enough interference, you know.
[00:26:57.769 --> 00:27:00.690]  He feels that the West is coming in and interfering on stuff right on the border.
[00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.732]  And remember what happened in 62 when the missiles were going to be installed in Cuba.
[00:27:05.133 --> 00:27:08.014]  I mean, America went insane because it was right off the coast of America.
[00:27:08.114 --> 00:27:10.455]  And this is right off the coast, right off the coast.
[00:27:10.495 --> 00:27:13.917]  It's right attached to Russia and it was a former satellite, so.
[00:27:13.977 --> 00:27:14.537]  No, but you're right.
[00:27:14.557 --> 00:27:17.179]  They're moving NATO ships into that area as well.
[00:27:17.299 --> 00:27:17.439]  Yeah.
[00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:19.260]  So it's a major escalation.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:26.825]  And America has been spending $5 billion over the past 15-20 years to promote its agenda in Ukraine.
[00:27:27.485 --> 00:27:34.450]  And you know, there have been some reports that some of the protesters are being directly paid by American satellite organizations and so on.
[00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:41.854]  So that is an extreme invasion of sovereignty of Eastern Europe and of Russia.
[00:27:41.874 --> 00:27:44.476]  Again, not to defend Russia, it's an autocracy and Putin's a horrible
[00:27:44.616 --> 00:28:01.346]  But it's a giant provocation, and in common law, and in common sense, you start something, you lose moral high ground, which shows the delusional nature with Kerry saying you can't invade countries when they just did this to Syria, they just did this to Libya, and now they actually started this operation.
[00:28:01.886 --> 00:28:02.967]  It just shows the hubris.
[00:28:03.427 --> 00:28:07.209]  You raised the point of Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney and Obama laughing at them.
[00:28:07.489 --> 00:28:14.653]  Yeah, so in a debate with Mitt Romney in the last cycle, Mitt Romney said, well, you know, Russia could do something in the Ukraine.
[00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:17.635]  And Barack Obama laughed at him and said, the 1980s are calling.
[00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:18.916]  They want their foreign policy back.
[00:28:19.516 --> 00:28:20.997]  The Cold War's been over for 20 years.
[00:28:21.057 --> 00:28:26.280]  Now, I think the Democratic Party has always had a pretty soft spot for Russia since the Al Jahiss incident and the HUAC.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.142]  And they were covering up so much of spies, Russian spies inside.
[00:28:30.182 --> 00:28:34.585]  Well, yeah, I mean, putting libertarians and conservatives and freedom lovers in death camps is their dream.
[00:28:34.865 --> 00:28:36.366]  So Stalin was kind of their rock star.
[00:28:36.946 --> 00:28:39.707]  Yeah, and the covering up of Stalin's crimes and all of this kind of stuff.
[00:28:39.867 --> 00:28:43.069]  Let's just put it this way, they have pin-ups spread centerfolds of Stalin.
[00:28:43.209 --> 00:28:47.210]  Oh yeah, they've really been very pro-Communist, very pro-Russia, because they're on the left, right?
[00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:53.573]  You know, the moment is like, anti-Russia on the left is about as prevalent as anti-war sentiments when you have a Democrat in the White House.
[00:28:54.393 --> 00:28:56.515]  Yeah, so I think that they're not really seeing things very clearly.
[00:28:56.575 --> 00:29:07.424]  Russia has changed to some degree, but it still remains very autocratic, very dictatorial, and you know, this guy came out of the KGB ranks not known for its touchy-friendly democratic feeler.
[00:29:07.464 --> 00:29:11.367]  So I think it is not something that is going to be a huge escalation situation.
[00:29:11.407 --> 00:29:14.630]  It's just that they've moved to protect their military assets when there was an unstable government.
[00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.152]  That seems to me, I mean, I don't agree with any of it.
[00:29:17.192 --> 00:29:18.613]  I mean, it's all just a bunch of thugs.
[00:29:19.514 --> 00:29:26.556]  The EU just wants to liquidate another corrupt state and suck it dry, and this group of thugs want to be paid off by the EU for the assets.
[00:29:27.156 --> 00:29:32.137]  I mean, all it is is Russia and the EU and George Soros struggling over looting something.
[00:29:32.377 --> 00:29:37.019]  Well, and now, you know, the way they're being bought off, and it all comes back down to buying people off.
[00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:39.219]  It's all just a Mafia movie in nice suits.
[00:29:39.739 --> 00:29:43.420]  But they all end up getting, so now the EU is going to put a $15 billion aid package in.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.441]  America is going to kick up another billion dollars.
[00:29:45.481 --> 00:29:46.461]  Loan guarantees.
[00:29:46.681 --> 00:29:47.942]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:31:12.633 --> 00:31:17.458]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:31:17.638 --> 00:31:24.826]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:31:24.946 --> 00:31:30.368]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:34.289]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[00:32:07.314 --> 00:32:19.738]  InfoWarsShop.com In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:32:20.058 --> 00:32:21.919]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:22.799]  Fluoride.
[00:32:22.999 --> 00:32:24.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:31.241]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:32:31.502 --> 00:32:34.322]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[00:32:34.442 --> 00:32:36.283]  And the results are on record.
[00:32:36.423 --> 00:32:42.525]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:32:42.745 --> 00:32:44.905]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:32:45.165 --> 00:32:47.786]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:32:48.086 --> 00:32:51.487]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.651]  Talk show host, best-selling author Stefan Molyneux.
[00:33:31.671 --> 00:33:33.852]  He's in studio with us over the center of the next hour.
[00:33:34.192 --> 00:33:39.075]  Your phone calls are coming up in the next second, I promise, for folks that have been holding, like Steve.
[00:33:40.174 --> 00:33:44.856]  Dave and Fred and Todd and Robert, we'll get to all of you.
[00:33:44.876 --> 00:33:47.457]  A toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:33:47.517 --> 00:34:04.645]  I really do want to cover a whole swath of things with our informed guest here today and pick his brain on everything from Bitcoin to the attack on the Second Amendment and free speech and how that's now intersected with Bloomberg wanting to censor pro-gun Second Amendment defense online.
[00:34:04.665 --> 00:34:07.807]  And this is just unprecedented, really criminal
[00:34:08.747 --> 00:34:10.988]  Uh, level larceny going after our basic rights.
[00:34:11.028 --> 00:34:15.570]  I mean, we should all just be burning with, with, with anger.
[00:34:16.291 --> 00:34:19.792]  Uh, but, but, but I guess the tyrants have gotten us where we're used to being run over by them.
[00:34:19.832 --> 00:34:22.574]  It's just, it's, it's, it's like deer in the headlights.
[00:34:22.614 --> 00:34:27.096]  I'm dumbfounded now by how arrogant they are, but, but it is good to see the awakening happening.
[00:34:27.116 --> 00:34:31.518]  But Stefan, before I segue off into a bunch of my questions, uh,
[00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:34.237]  What are some points you haven't gotten to yet?
[00:34:34.877 --> 00:34:37.878]  Well, actually, let's lobby it back to you, Alex.
[00:34:38.078 --> 00:34:44.840]  How do you feel about the departure of dear Piers Morgan from the fair shores of the United States?
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:51.681]  Do I need a Kleenex for you with a tear in your eye with great sorrow to see the anti-gun advocate exit the scene?
[00:34:51.941 --> 00:34:56.102]  In a way, I am sad because him talking down his nose at everybody and being arrogant
[00:34:56.682 --> 00:34:59.905]  And basically saying, you know, Americans were all running around with coonskin caps.
[00:35:00.446 --> 00:35:01.166]  Backfired.
[00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:03.228]  He didn't implode.
[00:35:03.328 --> 00:35:04.810]  He imploded day one.
[00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:06.171]  He never succeeded.
[00:35:06.451 --> 00:35:08.393]  He effectively wasn't on the air anymore.
[00:35:09.114 --> 00:35:13.478]  He took 2 million viewers every night and had it down to 380,000 when he left.
[00:35:13.998 --> 00:35:15.419]  And it's the same for MSNBC.
[00:35:15.439 --> 00:35:16.560]  They're all in freefall.
[00:35:16.901 --> 00:35:18.162]  So I ask you the question.
[00:35:19.491 --> 00:35:21.673]  I mean, maybe zombies are real.
[00:35:21.773 --> 00:35:23.594]  I always thought it was medically impossible.
[00:35:23.614 --> 00:35:25.456]  You have zombie banks.
[00:35:25.496 --> 00:35:26.657]  This is zombie media.
[00:35:27.217 --> 00:35:29.639]  Well, look, I mean, the gun thing is tricky.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:36.124]  And it's not tricky because the facts aren't on the side of the First Amendment rights, Second Amendment rights guys.
[00:35:36.865 --> 00:35:39.447]  It's just tricky because people see a gun and they think violence.
[00:35:39.467 --> 00:35:40.508]  They don't think protection.
[00:35:40.768 --> 00:35:41.288]  Sure, I get it.
[00:35:41.308 --> 00:35:48.771]  People see a cop with a gun and they think protection, but they see a private citizen with a gun and the less intelligent among us are like, ooh, that's violent.
[00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:49.911]  Hollywood told them that.
[00:35:50.071 --> 00:35:55.133]  Yeah, and so the idea that guns prevent crime is kind of confusing to people.
[00:35:55.733 --> 00:35:57.794]  And, you know, it's like you exercise and you feel tired.
[00:35:57.854 --> 00:35:59.854]  It's like, well, how is this supposed to make me feel stronger?
[00:35:59.914 --> 00:36:01.115]  It's like you make you feel tired.
[00:36:01.895 --> 00:36:10.500]  So, for people who just live on the surface and see, oh, there's a gun, that must mean there's crime, as opposed to the idea that guns prevent, what, millions of crimes every year?
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.200]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.382]  But what you don't see, people have a tough time with, right?
[00:36:14.402 --> 00:36:15.742]  Forty-plus crimes are stopped.
[00:36:15.842 --> 00:36:16.723]  FBI has no numbers.
[00:36:16.743 --> 00:36:19.204]  They don't like to advertise for every time it's used in a crime.
[00:36:19.624 --> 00:36:19.844]  Right.
[00:36:20.305 --> 00:36:20.445]  Right.
[00:36:20.505 --> 00:36:25.027]  And they say, well, you know, you're more in danger of shooting yourself with a gun and all that kind of stuff.
[00:36:25.087 --> 00:36:27.768]  It's like, I think this is, statistically, this is all very false.
[00:36:27.788 --> 00:36:29.829]  Well, it's like saying you can't have a car, you might get killed with it.
[00:36:29.849 --> 00:36:30.730]  I mean, nothing's safe.
[00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:39.352]  Right, so there is this weird, dumb thinking where if you get rid of guns, you get rid of violence, which is again, it's just not true.
[00:36:39.592 --> 00:36:44.853]  It's like, you know, then why don't people say, well, let's get rid of police and we'll get rid of arrests and we'll get rid of jails and then there'll be no violence.
[00:36:45.334 --> 00:36:47.614]  Because nobody is fundamentally against guns.
[00:36:47.694 --> 00:36:50.755]  What they are for, the anti-gun people, what they're for
[00:36:51.235 --> 00:36:54.638]  Is for guns to be centralized in the hands of the elite.
[00:36:54.898 --> 00:36:57.540]  They are for the guns being centralized in the hands of the cops.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:02.523]  Because if you have anti-gun laws, cops with guns need to go around to people's houses and take those guns away.
[00:37:02.543 --> 00:37:05.385]  Which is now happening in Connecticut and California.
[00:37:05.425 --> 00:37:09.148]  And nobody, this is one thing to be really clear with anti-gun people, they're not anti-gun.
[00:37:09.488 --> 00:37:11.890]  They are very pro-government guns.
[00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.672]  They're just anti-private citizens guns, which is always something that happens.
[00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:17.694]  That's right, it's the ultimate form of discrimination.
[00:37:18.654 --> 00:37:23.258]  That's why they obsess on religion and race and sexual preference, because they don't care about all that.
[00:37:23.738 --> 00:37:29.662]  But when it comes to foreign banks getting bailouts, when it comes to them being exempt, diplomatic immunity, they have bodyguards, we don't.
[00:37:30.142 --> 00:37:31.804]  They're flaming hypocrites.
[00:37:32.164 --> 00:37:36.287]  Yeah, why don't you get the Secret Service to stop having guns, if not having guns around prevents crime?
[00:37:36.767 --> 00:37:43.571]  I mean, they spend so much money protecting the president with massive amounts of military force, and then for private citizens, you can't have protection.
[00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:44.351]  But they love it!
[00:37:44.571 --> 00:37:46.953]  They love it when you don't have private protection.
[00:37:47.073 --> 00:37:47.273]  Why?
[00:37:47.393 --> 00:37:47.953]  Well, you know why.
[00:37:48.013 --> 00:37:50.695]  Because then you're dependent on the government for protection, which will never come.
[00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:51.856]  Look what's happening to Detroit.
[00:37:51.916 --> 00:37:55.398]  Takes an hour or two to get someone to come by after 9-11.
[00:37:55.418 --> 00:37:56.818]  And the police chief said, buy a gun.
[00:37:56.998 --> 00:38:01.241]  Yeah, and basically they're there to identify your body if you're, you know, unlucky.
[00:38:01.701 --> 00:38:06.964]  So the government is continually breaking your leg and saying, then giving you a crush and saying, see without me you couldn't even walk.
[00:38:07.424 --> 00:38:08.204]  And this is what they do.
[00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:16.008]  They want to take away your protection the same way they want to take away your capacity to create your own job so then you're dependent upon government providing you minimum wage security and all that kind of stuff.
[00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:20.211]  They want to take away your capacity to save so you're dependent upon them for old age pension.
[00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:22.752]  And then they even write white papers like Cloward and Pivot admitting it.
[00:38:22.972 --> 00:38:23.132]  Yep.
[00:38:23.872 --> 00:38:24.213]  Absolutely.
[00:38:24.253 --> 00:38:28.875]  The creation of a dependent underclass is one of the most savage aspects of late model democracy.
[00:38:29.575 --> 00:38:30.216]  And it's it's
[00:38:30.982 --> 00:38:35.423]  Resisted to some degree by the Republicans, but it is avidly pursued by the Democrats.
[00:38:35.483 --> 00:38:38.584]  And now, of course, they want to make you dependent on the government for your health care.
[00:38:38.624 --> 00:38:43.345]  One of the most sensitive, difficult, emotionally draining and unstable things that happens.
[00:38:43.385 --> 00:38:46.605]  They're going to keep breaking the system until they say, look, we have to take it over.
[00:38:46.645 --> 00:38:47.245]  It's so broken.
[00:38:47.505 --> 00:38:48.566]  And by the way, you said that.
[00:38:48.606 --> 00:38:51.206]  Everybody else said that because we know how they operate in other countries.
[00:38:51.286 --> 00:38:53.847]  It's not like this is the first time they've done this.
[00:38:54.027 --> 00:38:55.147]  We watch him over and over again.
[00:38:55.627 --> 00:39:00.328]  And then even Ezekiel Emanuel comes out and says, yeah, we're trying to wreck the health care system right now.
[00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:06.057]  I mean, if I was trying to wreck a fire department, I should be thrown in jail if I wanted to burn down the fire department.
[00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:12.266]  He wants to burn down the health care system, destroy our... and then he's a hero!
[00:39:12.607 --> 00:39:13.869]  And he admits it on Fox News!
[00:39:15.629 --> 00:39:16.190]  It's terrorism.
[00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:17.010]  It's terrorism.
[00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:20.074]  You know, by any rational definition, it is terrorism.
[00:39:20.094 --> 00:39:21.235]  That's right, he's a terrorist.
[00:39:21.295 --> 00:39:26.140]  Yeah, you are destroying the lifeline for human beings to survive illnesses.
[00:39:26.881 --> 00:39:28.663]  And you are making them dependent upon a system.
[00:39:28.723 --> 00:39:33.428]  Now, at the beginning, this happened in Canada, which nationalized healthcare a generation or two ago.
[00:39:34.028 --> 00:39:39.291]  Now the first generation gets it pretty good, because the doctors all grew up in that system, in the remnants of the free market.
[00:39:39.331 --> 00:39:42.052]  They're used to doing house calls, they're used to being really good at serving.
[00:39:42.072 --> 00:39:42.853]  They're honourable.
[00:39:42.993 --> 00:39:43.953]  Yeah, that doesn't just change.
[00:39:44.013 --> 00:39:45.014]  It goes from the machine.
[00:39:45.034 --> 00:39:48.015]  And then it takes a while for that echo effect to fade away.
[00:39:48.035 --> 00:39:59.822]  And then the next generation of doctors who come in, who never faced any free market restrictions, or never had to do customer service, and they basically get paid by the government for ignoring their patients, the second generation is where it really, really gets hit hard.
[00:40:00.002 --> 00:40:01.462]  And that's what happened in Canada as well.
[00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:02.123]  First generation?
[00:40:02.823 --> 00:40:06.724]  Doctors still working hard, they're still caring about them, but you don't suddenly stop caring because the government takes over.
[00:40:07.004 --> 00:40:11.405]  But the next generation of doctors, you know, it's like the first generation of the NASA engineers did some great stuff.
[00:40:11.745 --> 00:40:13.166]  You know, what have they done over the last 30 years?
[00:40:13.186 --> 00:40:15.606]  They've just kept photocopying the space shuttle and calling it progress.
[00:40:16.486 --> 00:40:24.708]  So this is one thing that is an illusion, that when you take something over and you've got some free market remnants, it actually works relatively okay and it slowly goes out of focus over time.
[00:40:25.008 --> 00:40:31.430]  Then the next generation, as is so often the case with the government, gets really hosed with debt and a completely dysfunctional system.
[00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:37.015]  I mean, when they first privatized the educational system, the teachers didn't wake up not caring anymore, right?
[00:40:37.215 --> 00:40:43.961]  But a generation or two later, when you can no longer get fired and everyone's just going in there to hide out from anything else.
[00:40:44.001 --> 00:40:48.825]  Then it gets worse and worse and worse, but by then the system is too embedded to undo with anything short of revolution.
[00:40:49.165 --> 00:40:51.527]  I mean, sort of a verbal revolution, a revolution in
[00:40:51.607 --> 00:41:01.815]  And no one can deny, look at all the numbers, I mean, the metrics, the lowering test scores, the physically lowering IQ, the obesity, the cancer rates, the saving rates.
[00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:06.138]  I mean, every gauge, the West is in free fall.
[00:41:06.778 --> 00:41:11.882]  And the problem is, you look at everywhere else, they've never even gone up to the heights to fall.
[00:41:12.402 --> 00:41:15.685]  I mean, it's a bad... What do you expect if we don't get the new renaissance going?
[00:41:16.085 --> 00:41:18.347]  An absolute new dark age?
[00:41:18.407 --> 00:41:19.788]  I mean, this is a pretty bad situation.
[00:41:20.509 --> 00:41:38.923]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the one thing that is so frustrating, you know, as a former technology entrepreneur and executive, one thing that's so frustrating, Alex, is that the remnants of the free market keep creating all of these incredible things, you know, like cell phones, where you can video around the world, you know, when you're on a data plan virtually for free.
[00:41:40.124 --> 00:41:47.089]  And all of this stuff that is so incredible, the human productivity, human connectivity, you know, we have the new Gutenberg press, as you and I talked about in a show before.
[00:41:47.529 --> 00:41:54.657]  Which allows us to communicate the greatest ideas with no gatekeepers, no people in the way between people who've got great ideas and people who can receive them.
[00:41:54.677 --> 00:42:01.565]  You don't have to pass through the censorious... Yeah, we're not saying the technology's bad, it's just that Soron's trying to put his will into the computers.
[00:42:01.966 --> 00:42:02.246]  Go ahead.
[00:42:02.346 --> 00:42:03.568]  The government keeps taking it over.
[00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:10.153]  And that which was designed to facilitate communication and spread ideas is now being used to control... Well, it's like you said, the paradox.
[00:42:10.213 --> 00:42:11.214]  It's true, historically.
[00:42:11.774 --> 00:42:20.381]  A freer country creates so much wealth, everyone's bathing in luxury, then the kids become spoiled, they don't appreciate it, decadence comes in, tyranny comes in.
[00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:21.923]  How do you get by that cycle?
[00:42:22.423 --> 00:42:27.485]  By having huge human goals that we individually believe in, so collectively carry out?
[00:42:27.925 --> 00:42:33.647]  Well, my argument is that you have to rethink all the basic human institutions that we have inherited from history.
[00:42:34.107 --> 00:42:36.288]  Everything that is inherited is open to question.
[00:42:36.308 --> 00:42:38.608]  You know, we did this with slavery in the West, right?
[00:42:38.708 --> 00:42:42.970]  I mean, the Western European Christian culture fought... We ended it, so we get blamed with it.
[00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:44.290]  Yeah, of course, naturally, right?
[00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.211]  I mean, nobody's going to the Muslims for reparations.
[00:42:46.231 --> 00:42:47.932]  They had a far harsher slave trade than the West.
[00:42:47.952 --> 00:42:48.992]  Well, it's going on right now.
[00:42:49.072 --> 00:42:52.073]  Yeah, and only 5% of the slaves in the Atlantic trade ended up in America.
[00:42:52.293 --> 00:42:57.576]  Which, you know, it doesn't justify the institution, but it certainly means that if you're going to look for scapegoats for slavery, you don't start with America.
[00:42:57.656 --> 00:43:05.080]  But what happens is every institution, now we've inherited this centralized, collective, violent monopoly called the state.
[00:43:05.922 --> 00:43:07.843]  I think we need to open it up to question.
[00:43:07.943 --> 00:43:09.564]  Is this the best way to organize society?
[00:43:09.604 --> 00:43:20.809]  Do we really want to get stuck in this continual cycle where the government lets you have some freedom, you generate some wealth, the government takes that wealth and uses it to expand itself at your expense and eventually kills the goose that lays the golden egg?
[00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:28.472]  This cycle has been around since ancient Egypt, ancient Rome, ancient Greece, the modern British Empire, German Empires, Austria, Hungarian Empires.
[00:43:28.532 --> 00:43:29.072]  It's the same thing.
[00:43:29.092 --> 00:43:29.753]  A little bit of freedom.
[00:43:30.373 --> 00:43:30.974]  Make some money!
[00:43:31.214 --> 00:43:35.279]  Government taxes grows into an empire.
[00:43:35.439 --> 00:43:37.181]  They become arrogant, disconnected.
[00:43:37.561 --> 00:43:40.104]  And then there's this, you kill the remnants of the free market.
[00:43:40.365 --> 00:43:41.666]  Where's America down now?
[00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:43.869]  They went down like five or six points in the economic free market.
[00:43:43.889 --> 00:43:46.291]  Oh yeah, well there's like scores of countries ahead of us now.
[00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:49.261]  And in freedom of the press and everything we're going down.
[00:43:49.802 --> 00:43:57.749]  But on the plus side, the mainstream media appears to be having a good internet stake being driven through its heart, which I think is a glorious end to a ghastly beast.
[00:43:58.170 --> 00:43:59.291]  And that brings me to my next point.
[00:43:59.431 --> 00:44:02.093]  They will then respond by trying to censor.
[00:44:02.794 --> 00:44:20.218]  And there's moves to not let you deny man-made global warming, Bloomberg moves to ban pro-gun speech, Facebook now working with a former New York mayor to censor support for the Second Amendment, and it goes to these anti-gun sites where they're in talks and admit he's funding it to not let pro-Second Amendment speech be on Facebook.
[00:44:20.498 --> 00:44:21.758]  They could have bots that block it.
[00:44:21.778 --> 00:44:24.319]  We've already seen our pro-gun memes being blocked.
[00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:27.079]  People go, well, that's their own, they own that site.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.160]  They advertised it as a commons.
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.761]  Yes.
[00:44:30.841 --> 00:44:39.468]  They built it on our material, like YouTube, and then now they're clearly... I mean, this is... We don't know what they're being threatened with behind the scenes.
[00:44:39.648 --> 00:44:42.491]  I mean, I can't imagine... I'm just saying that's outrageous.
[00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:42.911]  No, it is.
[00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:44.372]  Now Bloomberg wants to get rid of free speech.
[00:44:44.392 --> 00:44:45.393]  That's the beauty of it, though.
[00:44:45.773 --> 00:44:46.834]  Son of a bitch.
[00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:49.997]  They only shoot at the airplanes over the target, right?
[00:44:50.037 --> 00:44:52.339]  When you get close to the target, that's when you get the anti-aircraft.
[00:44:52.359 --> 00:44:53.299]  Oh, we're kicking their butt.
[00:44:53.419 --> 00:44:53.640]  Yeah.
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:58.644]  So the fact that, I mean, you know you're achieving something when the powers that be don't like what you're doing.
[00:44:59.464 --> 00:45:03.026]  You know a drug works on an illness when the illness, if it were conscious, would hate that drug, right?
[00:45:03.046 --> 00:45:08.928]  So the fact that there's outrage and frustration and counterattacks, squealing, it's beautiful.
[00:45:08.969 --> 00:45:15.732]  I mean, if you know you're doing nothing, if nobody is bothered by anything you're doing, there's a great quote from Churchill where he said, you have enemies, good!
[00:45:16.292 --> 00:45:19.233]  That means that you have stood up for something sometime in your life.
[00:45:19.593 --> 00:45:27.197]  And the fact that people are being attacked for pro-free speech, for pro-gun, for pro-freedom, for pro-trade, for
[00:45:27.657 --> 00:45:29.518]  Yeah, don't take it like, oh, I better give up.
[00:45:29.558 --> 00:45:31.299]  Take it like, I'm affecting something.
[00:45:31.319 --> 00:45:32.220]  I'm on to something here.
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:33.701]  I'm bothering bad people.
[00:45:33.741 --> 00:45:35.242]  That's what good people are supposed to do.
[00:45:35.262 --> 00:45:36.723]  We're supposed to bother bad people.
[00:45:36.763 --> 00:45:37.663]  That's the whole point.
[00:45:38.264 --> 00:45:40.785]  So I think it's great that there's a lot of flack being sent up.
[00:45:40.885 --> 00:45:44.567]  If there wasn't, we'd be peddling in a basement in the dark doing nothing.
[00:45:44.868 --> 00:45:46.729]  But it does show what authoritarians they are.
[00:45:47.289 --> 00:45:53.613]  They're now sending out hundreds of thousands of letters saying, well, you didn't turn in your semi-automatic handgun, or you didn't register it.
[00:45:54.093 --> 00:45:55.493]  Turn it in or we're going to SWAT team you.
[00:45:55.813 --> 00:45:58.114]  That article is linked on red on Infowars.com.
[00:45:58.774 --> 00:46:01.235]  They're trying to pass another law to expand gun confiscation.
[00:46:01.255 --> 00:46:04.856]  They're banning masonry gun manufacturing in California with micro-stamping.
[00:46:05.176 --> 00:46:07.576]  They just shut down the last lead smelter for lead bullets.
[00:46:07.916 --> 00:46:13.478]  I want people, especially young people, lift the curtain, see the gun.
[00:46:14.038 --> 00:46:14.518]  See the gun.
[00:46:14.778 --> 00:46:15.358]  That is the state.
[00:46:15.378 --> 00:46:20.119]  You know, like there was this very energetic Occupy movement where they were outraged at the bankers, right?
[00:46:20.159 --> 00:46:24.060]  And they wanted, and they had all these crazy socialist nonsense because, you know, they're academic.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:24.980]  They tried to hijack it.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:25.580]  Yeah, yeah, I got it.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:36.502]  But what they did see, which was a terrifyingly beautiful thing for the young to see, what they saw was 3,000 activists being arrested and zero bankers.
[00:46:36.562 --> 00:46:39.263]  In fact, the bankers got hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts.
[00:46:39.403 --> 00:46:43.305]  And Homeland Security simultaneously directing it in 35 cities.
[00:46:43.665 --> 00:46:45.667]  They're being scooped up at 2 a.m.
[00:46:46.087 --> 00:46:46.467]  And good.
[00:46:47.027 --> 00:46:51.550]  I'm sorry that it happened to them, but at least they're seeing what it is that they're facing.
[00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:58.394]  And they will be, hopefully, if they've got any brains in their skulls, they will not be tempted to go to the state for solutions when they see the state paying off
[00:46:58.874 --> 00:47:07.817]  The people who prey upon the poor and the middle class and who sell off the unborn in debt and bonds, they will see them rewarding those people and arresting their brothers and sisters in a revolutionary movement.
[00:47:08.017 --> 00:47:11.138]  Hopefully then they will turn away from the state because all we need to do is lift the veil.
[00:47:11.558 --> 00:47:15.259]  Evil can never win because the moment that people see it as evil, they reject it.
[00:47:15.339 --> 00:47:16.059]  Evil always has to come.
[00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:16.479]  That's right.
[00:47:16.499 --> 00:47:28.323]  As soon as we understand the New World Order is a private corporate system that's anti-free market, seeking to shut down competition through the state monopoly combine, as soon as those two things are connected by the right wing and the left wing, it's game over.
[00:47:28.903 --> 00:47:45.728]  It's game over that George Soros is basically tax exempt, General Electric, Google, Warren Buffett, his company's 400 plus million of bailout money the last six years while he lobbies for higher taxes on the middle class because he literally is shutting down his competition while feeding on us like a mosquito.
[00:47:46.188 --> 00:47:49.789]  I mean, it's game over for that piece of crap the minute that's understood.
[00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:56.614]  Yeah, was it a guy who goes to buy a joint in Colorado, has in that purchase paid more taxes than all of General Electric?
[00:47:56.774 --> 00:47:59.816]  Yeah, they make up the rules and they exempt themselves.
[00:47:59.836 --> 00:48:04.719]  That's the whole point of power, is to inflict rules on others and escape those rules yourself.
[00:48:04.739 --> 00:48:09.963]  You know, if you could convince everyone else in the world to not be a thief, your job as a thief would be totally easy.
[00:48:10.363 --> 00:48:14.386]  Nobody would have any locks, they wouldn't protect anything, they'd just assume they lost it or mislaid it, right?
[00:48:14.726 --> 00:48:18.129]  The whole purpose of ethics historically has been to convince the masses to be good,
[00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:22.371]  So that they're productive, which makes them fatter cattle to be preyed on by the rulers.
[00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:26.353]  The rulers give us ethics to make sure we don't compete with their evil.
[00:48:26.613 --> 00:48:28.655]  It's got nothing to do with them actually believing.
[00:48:28.675 --> 00:48:31.056]  You know, thou shalt not steal is a foundational ethic.
[00:48:31.336 --> 00:48:36.139]  I don't believe anyone has ever said, well, but you see, taxation is a form of theft, and therefore it's a violation of one of the Ten Commandments.
[00:48:36.279 --> 00:48:37.419]  That's like Ron Paul's sign.
[00:48:37.439 --> 00:48:38.420]  He says, don't steal.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.301]  Government doesn't like competition.
[00:48:40.321 --> 00:48:41.221]  Yeah, but it hates competition, yeah.
[00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:42.702]  This is the whole problem of ethics.
[00:48:42.762 --> 00:48:47.345]  It's invented by, and I'm an ethical guy, and I believe in universal ethics, and I believe in virtue.
[00:48:47.785 --> 00:48:53.711]  The problem is they use it to make us simpleton chumps and naive while they are rapacious.
[00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:55.773]  Yeah, I mean, only idiots rob banks.
[00:48:55.833 --> 00:48:57.795]  If you want to be a good bank robber, own a bank.
[00:48:58.095 --> 00:48:58.615]  That's the way.
[00:48:58.815 --> 00:48:59.216]  That's the way.
[00:48:59.256 --> 00:48:59.616]  Exactly.
[00:48:59.756 --> 00:49:06.763]  But make your point uninterrupted about the... Well, it's just so... We're always told as kids, you know, like, don't steal, don't push, don't use force to get your way.
[00:49:06.783 --> 00:49:07.323]  Negotiate.
[00:49:07.424 --> 00:49:08.024]  Use your words.
[00:49:08.064 --> 00:49:08.985]  That's what they always say, right?
[00:49:08.985 --> 00:49:09.165]  I don't
[00:49:29.315 --> 00:49:32.638]  But with us, we get guns and we get jail.
[00:49:33.098 --> 00:49:33.399]  With us.
[00:49:33.439 --> 00:49:41.566]  So with each other, with rulers, they all deal with each other diplomatically and they negotiate and they threaten things and so on, but they don't threaten war that much in the West anymore.
[00:49:42.407 --> 00:49:44.769]  But with us, we get guns and we get jail.
[00:49:45.169 --> 00:49:49.233]  And this is the horrible... And it's only because it's safe for us that we don't have nukes.
[00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:50.433]  Yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:49:50.493 --> 00:49:54.515]  I mean, we're the livestock, and they care about us insofar as they want us to be productive.
[00:49:54.655 --> 00:49:58.537]  They empathize with us like a farmer empathizes with a cow's desire not to put his face in it.
[00:49:58.557 --> 00:50:01.998]  And they describe us, all elites throughout history call their subjects cattle.
[00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:03.219]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:50:03.239 --> 00:50:04.319]  We're just a form of livestock.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.681]  The Aztecs called their lower class, you know, basically livestock.
[00:50:09.102 --> 00:50:10.242]  Slavs were a livestock.
[00:50:10.402 --> 00:50:13.644]  You know, in the ancient Hebrew stuff, the neighbors were a livestock.
[00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:16.605]  But I mean, to the Egyptians, everybody else was livestock.
[00:50:17.325 --> 00:50:19.206]  Every, the Nazis, everybody else was livestock.
[00:50:19.366 --> 00:50:19.466]  Yeah.
[00:50:19.486 --> 00:50:20.326]  I mean, that's how it works.
[00:50:20.346 --> 00:50:22.126]  We're gonna go to break, come right back with phone calls.
[00:50:22.346 --> 00:50:23.627]  We'll be with us 20 minutes to the next hour.
[00:50:23.667 --> 00:50:26.247]  We'll get into the health care, the global warming, all of it.

[00:54:49.102 --> 00:54:52.164]  Make no mistake, as I like to say, we do not live in boring times.
[00:54:52.184 --> 00:54:57.707]  It was very interesting times, the old Chinese adage that, yeah, it's interesting, but it also has a double meaning, and it's very serious.
[00:54:58.567 --> 00:55:05.831]  And, you know, the crazy thing is, I'm just somebody that studied history and common sense, and much of what we've broken down has turned out to be the truth.
[00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:15.956]  They've gone through this process of there's no government drug dealing, there's no government money laundering, there's no cancer viruses being added to the vaccines, there's no covert population reduction programs.
[00:55:15.996 --> 00:55:24.001]  Now it's just all coming out, but it almost just inoculates people psychologically to go, okay, big deal, to where they'll put up with anything.
[00:55:24.041 --> 00:55:27.763]  So, how do you quantify that paradox I'm kind of getting at?
[00:55:28.884 --> 00:55:32.526]  Well, for me at least, being a freedom fighter means always being sorry that I'm right.
[00:55:33.527 --> 00:55:43.877]  You know, because it's like, I feel like a sort of doctor, you know, you've got a patient who smokes and smokes, you keep saying, man, you've got to stop smoking, it's going to make you sick, you've got to stop, and a guy keeps smoking and then he gets sick, and you're like, man, I hate being right.
[00:55:44.278 --> 00:55:57.150]  I just, I wish I'd been wrong, like, so it all turned out to not be true, and we're now the poor, we're no longer poor, income disparities had come down, national debt had been paid off, and peace and unicorns and rainbows, you know, populated the planet.
[00:55:57.831 --> 00:56:02.473]  But it is a gruesome thing to know where this kind of system leads.
[00:56:02.833 --> 00:56:05.415]  There is no end to power lust.
[00:56:05.915 --> 00:56:06.875]  You know, they've done studies.
[00:56:07.476 --> 00:56:12.418]  The acquisition of power over other human beings is more addictive than cocaine.
[00:56:12.838 --> 00:56:18.221]  It actually releases the same kind of chemical hormones in the brain that a drug addiction does.
[00:56:18.301 --> 00:56:24.004]  Yeah, but I like seeing people empowered in art and literature and, you know,
[00:56:25.204 --> 00:56:27.005]  Huge exploration being launched.
[00:56:27.165 --> 00:56:28.526]  I don't like telling people what to do.
[00:56:28.826 --> 00:56:31.307]  No, no, that's, you know, because you're not addicted to power.
[00:56:31.747 --> 00:56:35.329]  But it is a very, very powerful addiction, right?
[00:56:35.369 --> 00:56:37.830]  I mean, what's that guy said?
[00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.311]  Stroke of the pen, law of the land.
[00:56:40.771 --> 00:56:41.471]  Alba Gala.
[00:56:41.672 --> 00:56:43.913]  Yeah, I mean... Stroke of the pen, law of the land.
[00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:44.333]  Kind of cool.
[00:56:44.453 --> 00:56:48.975]  Yeah, I mean, that amount of power to... I mean, imagine what Obama can do.
[00:56:49.055 --> 00:56:51.116]  What about Obama going, I'm good at killing people.
[00:56:51.716 --> 00:56:56.801]  Yeah, well, you know, he may not like to- I mean, even if you're a real killer, you don't like, oh, I'm really good at killing people.
[00:56:56.941 --> 00:57:01.905]  Yeah, I guess this isn't an ad I've not seen on anyone's business card yet, but Obama, I mean, look at this.
[00:57:01.965 --> 00:57:04.667]  He can pass Obamacare.
[00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:09.372]  He can then add thousands of amendments to it after the fact with no congressional.
[00:57:10.452 --> 00:57:12.373]  He can be the savior of his own bill.
[00:57:12.674 --> 00:57:12.894]  Yeah.
[00:57:13.094 --> 00:57:14.535]  He can fix his own problem.
[00:57:15.015 --> 00:57:16.276]  They can hand out waivers?
[00:57:16.876 --> 00:57:19.137]  A direct contradiction of the Constitution.
[00:57:19.157 --> 00:57:20.118]  Total discrimination.
[00:57:20.238 --> 00:57:22.579]  Supposed to guarantee you equal treatment under the law.
[00:57:22.599 --> 00:57:23.940]  They're handing out thousands of those.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.781]  Those are royal indulgences.
[00:57:26.182 --> 00:57:29.023]  It's papal middle ages nonsense, right?
[00:57:29.043 --> 00:57:33.306]  So that kind of power, you can lie to people and say you'll keep your doctor.
[00:57:33.979 --> 00:57:35.140]  And then what are the consequences?
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.481]  I mean, you lied to the government.
[00:57:37.101 --> 00:57:39.983]  You are going away to a dark hole for a very long time.
[00:57:40.283 --> 00:57:41.444]  The government lies to you.
[00:57:41.804 --> 00:57:43.866]  They get your vote with no negative consequences.
[00:57:43.906 --> 00:57:45.747]  They have no contract with you.
[00:57:45.767 --> 00:57:46.207]  That's right.
[00:57:46.227 --> 00:57:52.532]  When the FBI's been here before with subpoenas for people threatening on the website or something, you know, just side issues, they go talk to me and I go, I cannot talk to you.
[00:57:53.112 --> 00:57:55.853]  Because you always keep people in jail saying they gave false answers.
[00:57:56.353 --> 00:57:57.353]  And that's unconstitutional law.
[00:57:57.393 --> 00:57:58.073]  I'm not talking to you.
[00:57:58.613 --> 00:57:59.073]  Well, talk to me.
[00:57:59.093 --> 00:57:59.834]  No, no, you don't understand.
[00:58:00.154 --> 00:58:02.034]  The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk to the government.
[00:58:02.334 --> 00:58:03.634]  The second rule is don't talk to the government.
[00:58:03.854 --> 00:58:05.195]  The third rule is keep your mouth shut.
[00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:06.375]  The fourth rule is shut up.
[00:58:06.635 --> 00:58:07.875]  What's the fifth rule?
[00:58:07.915 --> 00:58:08.656]  Don't talk to the government.
[00:58:08.836 --> 00:58:09.876]  I'm going to go out on a limb here.
[00:58:09.916 --> 00:58:11.256]  It kind of goes on forever.
[00:58:11.296 --> 00:58:12.176]  Kind of goes for infinity.
[00:58:12.196 --> 00:58:15.037]  The eighth rule, interestingly enough, is don't talk to the government.
[00:58:15.417 --> 00:58:17.459]  Yeah, so they have no duty to protect you.
[00:58:17.479 --> 00:58:18.780]  They have no duty to control you.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.741]  You have no control over your government.
[00:58:20.781 --> 00:58:25.385]  People think that the vote, all you're doing is voting for people already bought and sold by special interests.
[00:58:25.445 --> 00:58:28.927]  You know, they should have those NASCAR stickers all over the congressman by who's bought and sold them.
[00:58:28.967 --> 00:58:30.769]  It's not your interest that they're... Well, that's it!
[00:58:30.849 --> 00:58:37.174]  People in government corporations and all this, they just join their group and then distort everything according to what group they're with.
[00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:46.539]  And I thought I was on Team Humanity to have a college of ideas where we vote in the free market for what we believe in through free association.
[00:58:46.619 --> 00:58:48.100]  That's what builds a great civilization.
[00:58:50.261 --> 00:58:53.643]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:08.701 --> 00:59:16.908]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:17.108 --> 00:59:21.792]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:59:35.964 --> 00:59:42.810]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:47.331]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:00:15.721 --> 01:00:16.742]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.482 --> 01:00:18.583]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.244 --> 01:00:20.045]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.825 --> 01:00:21.686]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.366 --> 01:00:26.009]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:30.673]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.213 --> 01:00:34.856]  By the way, the biggest buzz I've ever heard, I think, is for House of Cards.
[01:00:34.956 --> 01:00:36.558]  I haven't seen it one episode yet.
[01:00:36.598 --> 01:00:37.658]  Just quite frankly, I'm either
[01:00:38.459 --> 01:00:39.980]  With my family, or I'm working at night.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.901]  I just, it's kind of shameful.
[01:00:41.921 --> 01:00:44.762]  All work and no play makes Jack a crazy boy.
[01:00:45.503 --> 01:00:49.945]  But I've got to start watching this because they say the Chinese government's obsessed with it.
[01:00:49.965 --> 01:00:52.606]  It's getting watched like a hundred million times a week or something worldwide.
[01:00:53.007 --> 01:00:55.308]  With, well, Kevin Spacey played by me.
[01:00:55.348 --> 01:00:55.868]  I'm joking.
[01:00:56.228 --> 01:00:57.089]  People make that joke.
[01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:58.369]  I don't look like Kevin Spacey.
[01:00:58.389 --> 01:00:58.729]  Wish I did.
[01:00:58.749 --> 01:01:01.111]  The point is, is we got Stefan Molyneux here.
[01:01:01.131 --> 01:01:05.933]  We're taking phone calls this segment and the next, but he's going to give us his review of House of Cards.
[01:01:05.953 --> 01:01:07.114]  He's coming up.
[01:01:07.734 --> 01:01:08.375]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:01:08.435 --> 01:01:15.120]  Yeah, we just wanted to say hi to Steph and then watch that Karl Marx thing, bio, that you put together.
[01:01:26.633 --> 01:01:26.853]  Yeah.
[01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:34.378]  Oh, this is Karl Marx basically preying upon the poor and the working class after talking about capitalists being evil for doing the same thing.
[01:01:34.699 --> 01:01:39.162]  He had sex with his maid, had a kid, tossed her out on the street, never paid her a penny.
[01:01:40.002 --> 01:01:47.828]  All the studies that Karl Marx did of the market system at the time, he could never find a worker who wasn't paid anything except in his own house, his maid.
[01:01:47.888 --> 01:01:48.988]  He was the worst exploiter.
[01:01:49.008 --> 01:01:50.550]  I was just pointing out the moral hypocrisy.
[01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:52.531]  Oh, and he was an angel compared to Lenin.
[01:01:52.811 --> 01:01:58.096]  Oh yeah, well Lennon, he wasn't an outright murderer, Marx, but Lennon was an outright, just savage, genocidal murderer.
[01:01:58.196 --> 01:01:59.737]  I mean, non-stop bloodfests.
[01:01:59.798 --> 01:02:01.659]  But sorry, call her, we don't want to get distracted.
[01:02:01.679 --> 01:02:02.260]  Do you have a question?
[01:02:03.201 --> 01:02:15.352]  Well yeah, it's kind of funny, but just real quick, I wanted to talk about the IRS, I'm being honest, but it's funny how these neo-Marxists of today, through osmosis almost, have this same degree of hypocrisy
[01:02:16.423 --> 01:02:17.363]  That Karl Marx did.
[01:02:17.423 --> 01:02:19.604]  I mean, it's almost, like I said, it drew us most of the time.
[01:02:19.624 --> 01:02:20.205]  It's just incredible.
[01:02:20.225 --> 01:02:29.488]  They're bloodthirsty criminals who have grabbed the moral high ground and lectured to everyone when they're exempt from everything they're doing and engage in every dirty trick.
[01:02:29.508 --> 01:02:34.170]  And hey, you try claiming the fifth in an IRS investigation, they'll clap you in irons.
[01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:41.373]  But the hussy up there can be caught lying last year, taking the fifth, does it again, she doesn't get in trouble.
[01:02:41.713 --> 01:02:47.438]  And the IRS is going to be enforcing some aspects of Obamacare, and they are desperate to get out of Obamacare themselves.
[01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:49.639]  They are lobbying like crazy to get out of Obamacare.
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.502]  Oh yeah, the unions, the government people, they're all going to be exempt.
[01:02:52.542 --> 01:02:53.142]  Oh, it's for us.
[01:02:53.222 --> 01:02:54.143]  It's for us, Alex.
[01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.784]  I mean, you know, not for the rulers.
[01:02:55.804 --> 01:02:59.848]  I mean, you don't build, you know, your electric fences around your bedroom if you're the farmer.
[01:02:59.868 --> 01:03:00.848]  It's just for the cows.
[01:03:01.529 --> 01:03:01.829]  Horrible.
[01:03:01.989 --> 01:03:02.690]  Did you have another comment?
[01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:04.832]  That's where I need you guys' help.
[01:03:05.432 --> 01:03:06.313]  I am being audited.
[01:03:07.546 --> 01:03:08.527]  Sorry to hear that.
[01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:11.571]  I was a drywall contractor in Colorado.
[01:03:11.911 --> 01:03:16.797]  My entire livelihood and trade was awarded to illegal aliens.
[01:03:17.517 --> 01:03:22.002]  Put out of business my home, taken from the murders, all the value of my property.
[01:03:23.268 --> 01:03:44.964]  I know, they almost force you with, because again, I'm not even against the illegals, but the point is, you have them here, they'll work for less, their wives go on welfare, they then undermine the cost, you're in the system, the IRS comes and takes you over, you almost have to just survive to just start acting like the illegals, get a fake name, pay nothing, operate, do whatever you want, and then just sit there in jail when they arrest you for whatever, and they'll just let you out.
[01:03:44.984 --> 01:03:50.609]  I mean, you can really learn something from the illegals, they're almost the total libertarians, except they then siphon off the state.
[01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:52.330]  What do you say about that, Stefan?
[01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:55.952]  Oh, I mean, American immigration policy since the 60s has been a disaster.
[01:03:56.092 --> 01:04:06.519]  I mean, in the 60s, I mean, and this is the case in other countries like Australia and so on, they try to bring people in who are educated, who are at least share some of the common cultural values of the West.
[01:04:06.539 --> 01:04:10.302]  Yeah, I mean, you can't just go and try emigrating to Australia if you're coming from some third world country.
[01:04:10.902 --> 01:04:16.443]  The Democrats, and again I don't want to sound like I'm pounding on the Democrats, like I'm no Republican, but the Democrats... But they're the virulent cancer.
[01:04:16.463 --> 01:04:18.764]  They are very much bringing in their voting base.
[01:04:18.804 --> 01:04:21.944]  And their voting base is underskilled people from third world countries.
[01:04:21.964 --> 01:04:24.845]  This has been explicit in their platform since the 1960s.
[01:04:25.045 --> 01:04:26.986]  I think it was Ted Kennedy who first brought in this bill.
[01:04:27.386 --> 01:04:31.747]  Used to get 90% of immigrants from Europe, now get the majority of immigrants coming in from unskilled from third world.
[01:04:31.947 --> 01:04:33.127]  And this drives down wages.
[01:04:33.527 --> 01:04:36.909]  And then they say, well, now you see we need minimum wage laws to bring the wages back up.
[01:04:37.229 --> 01:04:39.350]  And it's, you know, I'm for open borders.
[01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:41.612]  There's no such thing as, you know, an illegal anybody, right?
[01:04:41.652 --> 01:04:47.495]  But given this policy, it's just a complete... Well, I was about to say, but yeah, you could have open borders worldwide if there wasn't any welfare.
[01:04:47.695 --> 01:04:48.035]  Exactly.
[01:04:48.055 --> 01:04:50.497]  But you have welfare and then let them vote to take my guns?
[01:04:50.557 --> 01:04:50.697]  Yeah.
[01:04:51.677 --> 01:04:55.140]  I mean, literally, they can then vote to make me their slave.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.460]  Yeah, and it happens.
[01:04:56.981 --> 01:04:58.442]  It is, that's what democracy is.
[01:04:59.042 --> 01:05:01.043]  Two wolves vote that I'm a sheep, I'm their dinner.
[01:05:01.584 --> 01:05:01.664]  Yeah.
[01:05:01.684 --> 01:05:05.546]  And they want to make me the sheep and take my guns.
[01:05:06.327 --> 01:05:06.827]  So I'm a sheep.
[01:05:07.207 --> 01:05:07.788]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:09.668 --> 01:05:10.509]  The facts are in.
[01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:11.809]  The studies are legion.
[01:05:12.089 --> 01:05:19.453]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:05:19.613 --> 01:05:23.055]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:05:23.435 --> 01:05:23.836]  Simple.
[01:05:23.996 --> 01:05:28.418]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:05:28.718 --> 01:05:34.161]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:05:34.441 --> 01:05:39.824]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:50.431]  Using six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:05:50.751 --> 01:05:54.994]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:05:55.334 --> 01:05:57.175]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[01:05:57.496 --> 01:06:02.799]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.

[01:06:07.462 --> 01:06:09.324]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:09.624 --> 01:06:12.206]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:06:12.466 --> 01:06:15.828]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over
[01:06:15.848 --> 01:06:17.329]  Over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:25.476]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:06:25.717 --> 01:06:30.020]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:06:30.241 --> 01:06:34.044]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:06:34.204 --> 01:06:39.906]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:06:40.146 --> 01:06:42.926]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:06:43.306 --> 01:06:48.528]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:06:48.688 --> 01:06:56.710]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:07:09.236 --> 01:07:12.578]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:07:12.658 --> 01:07:14.919]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:07:15.079 --> 01:07:20.262]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[01:07:20.402 --> 01:07:23.363]  There are many other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:07:23.663 --> 01:07:33.884]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:07:34.225 --> 01:07:47.607]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:48.027 --> 01:07:54.131]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:24.385]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[01:08:25.126 --> 01:08:29.029]  Well, there is a war on for your mind, big time, and I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.069 --> 01:08:32.111]  The news sites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:39.036]  The subscriber site for the nightly news is PrisonPlanet.tv, and Stefan Mullen is going to be on that show tonight, with our great reporters and researchers.
[01:08:39.977 --> 01:08:49.784]  Soon I'm launching the official TV system and expanding the show, and I'll be hosting the show, not just doing commentary like I did last night, most nights of the week, so no rest for those that don't want to be wicked.
[01:08:50.505 --> 01:08:53.327]  No rest for those that want to live in the age of reality and want to be free.
[01:08:53.907 --> 01:08:56.830]  It's an animating contest, it's addictive, so it's like exercise.
[01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:58.911]  Man, throw me in that brown patch every day.
[01:08:58.931 --> 01:09:01.653]  I got some really bad news for folks, but some good news as well.
[01:09:02.093 --> 01:09:03.515]  The enemy has shown their hand.
[01:09:04.315 --> 01:09:10.664]  We broke off of their sites bragging yesterday that they were about to get Facebook to restrict discussion of the Second Amendment.
[01:09:11.465 --> 01:09:14.669]  That article is Bloomberg moves to ban pro-gun speech.
[01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:20.791]  Facebook now working with the former New York mayor front groups to censor support for Second Amendment.
[01:09:21.311 --> 01:09:23.332]  This just got released an hour ago.
[01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.712]  It'll be going up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:26.032 --> 01:09:30.513]  Moms Demand Action, literally that's like three people in San Antonio when we had thousands out there.
[01:09:31.353 --> 01:09:32.853]  They tried to start a fight with us on video.
[01:09:33.354 --> 01:09:34.354]  I'll add that to the article.
[01:09:34.814 --> 01:09:36.754]  This just was released March 5th, that's today, 2014.
[01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:39.855]  Facebook's announced today that the company
[01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:44.912]  Uh, and it's popular photo sharing subsidiary Instagram will take significant steps.
[01:09:45.492 --> 01:09:51.374]  Remember, they arrest kids that draw a picture of a gun at school to block potentially illegal firearm sales through their platforms.
[01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:53.034]  Now, that's meant to sound reasonable.
[01:09:53.754 --> 01:10:00.956]  For the first time, the sites will delete reported post reported by them, offering to buy or sell guns without background checks.
[01:10:01.476 --> 01:10:02.837]  Now, people go, well, that sounds reasonable.
[01:10:03.317 --> 01:10:04.237]  Then you read deeper.
[01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:13.330]  Anyone with a profile under 18 won't be able to see things about guns or read the word gun so they can have bots that block everything.
[01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:14.211]  This has already happened to us.
[01:10:14.231 --> 01:10:18.595]  We send out a pro-gun meme with like Hitler saying, I love gun control, you know, and stuff like that.
[01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:21.679]  Or people about Benghazi, the Navy SEAL group, they just block it.
[01:10:21.699 --> 01:10:22.099]  Yeah.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.041]  And this has been their plan all along.
[01:10:24.061 --> 01:10:27.285]  And you read into the document, it's page after page.
[01:10:28.954 --> 01:10:29.394]  I don't think so.
[01:10:45.062 --> 01:10:51.324]  They create this illusion until the owner of the page acknowledges the page that includes the information prominently at the top of the page.
[01:10:51.704 --> 01:10:59.047]  Facebook's help center will remind sellers that they may conduct background checks for so it's all about you say you will comply with the laws.
[01:10:59.367 --> 01:11:02.508]  They're the new arbiters of free speech online.
[01:11:03.448 --> 01:11:10.672]  Facebook will provide public education ad space targeted at users interested in firearm related content to ensure they know about the gun laws.
[01:11:10.712 --> 01:11:21.158]  So now they'll be Mayor Bloomberg anti-gun, literally brainwashed the public as the Attorney General said, that famous quote, I'm sure you've seen that, targeted at people so they get free advertising now.
[01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:25.800]  And it goes on, it will block people from being able to see the gun sites.
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.522]  So it gives them free advertising, you name it.
[01:11:31.119 --> 01:11:37.983]  These people always set themselves up, like the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, over law enforcement, where they set all the policies.
[01:11:38.023 --> 01:11:38.563]  They're God.
[01:11:38.823 --> 01:11:39.904]  Rachel Maddow is God.
[01:11:40.384 --> 01:11:43.947]  Well, first of all, I can't imagine Facebook is really enjoying this process.
[01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:50.290]  You know, they say they're working with the New York government or whatever, and it's like, that's like me working with a mugger for the orderly transfer of my wallet.
[01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:53.192]  The fact that he has a gun to my ribs is pretty much the whole equation, right?
[01:11:53.212 --> 01:11:56.234]  I mean, what the government can do to business is significant.
[01:11:56.894 --> 01:12:01.578]  I know a lot of businesses use government to get rent-seeking, to get comparative advantage, and so on.
[01:12:01.938 --> 01:12:06.441]  But if the government comes knocking and says, we'd really like you to work with us, well, they are the guys with all the guns.
[01:12:06.721 --> 01:12:09.663]  And we've been so compliant, that's what's empowered the beast.
[01:12:09.984 --> 01:12:11.605]  It's time to start not complying.
[01:12:11.685 --> 01:12:14.227]  No, but what's beautiful about this, and we were just talking about this in the break,
[01:12:14.807 --> 01:12:25.318]  I think the government still thinks they have a monopoly of information distribution, like back in the day when there were like three networks and the government basically controlled or managed or had the license fees for all of these things, right?
[01:12:25.358 --> 01:12:26.579]  Licensed through the FCC.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:36.270]  Now, I mean, what a great way to educate kids about the Second Amendment, because Lord knows with teenagers, like these people have never met a teenager, you go to a teenager and say, you're not allowed to see this.
[01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:38.720]  And it's two clicks away on the internet.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:41.443]  What's the first thing that that... Stay out of the liquor cabinet!
[01:12:41.463 --> 01:12:41.923]  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:45.026]  I mean, I think the average age... Stop chasing cheerleaders!
[01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:51.913]  The average age of kids getting porn these days is 10 to 11 years old, when it's, you know, not legal until, I don't know, 18 or 19 or something like that, right?
[01:12:51.953 --> 01:12:58.819]  So, it's a beautiful way to get kids interested in the Second Amendment, to have Facebook, Facebook start blocking stuff, because now they're going to get educated about it.
[01:12:58.839 --> 01:12:59.239]  Well, that's it.
[01:12:59.259 --> 01:13:00.881]  They're putting it in the same category as porn.
[01:13:02.489 --> 01:13:18.745]  I mean, it's mad, and it's wonderful how much work the government is doing on behalf of liberty advocates in helping the teenagers to understand the power of the state and helping them get interested in topics now taboo, which is, you know, I mean, that's like catnip for a teenager.
[01:13:18.825 --> 01:13:19.526]  Oh, it's taboo!
[01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:21.147]  The powers that be don't want me to see this!
[01:13:22.068 --> 01:13:23.630]  Here, I'm going to go and find it right away.
[01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:25.612]  I mean, you couldn't advertise education.
[01:13:25.632 --> 01:13:26.532]  Well, listen, they did that.
[01:13:27.434 --> 01:13:30.339]  I actually figured out the reason I was successful.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:39.915]  One of the big make-it-or-break-it moments was I put out some documentaries about the military training for martial law, which they do perennially.
[01:13:39.935 --> 01:13:40.736]  They do it all the time.
[01:13:42.813 --> 01:13:45.615]  The military got a hold of these documentaries, Police State 2000 and others.
[01:13:45.675 --> 01:13:46.756]  I was already somewhat successful.
[01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:53.560]  And the Marine Corps and the Army, across the board, said, do not watch Alex Jones or listen to Alex Jones.
[01:13:54.101 --> 01:13:55.362]  Most of them didn't know who I was.
[01:13:55.422 --> 01:13:59.184]  That's why today, undoubtedly, we are like the number one show in the U.S.
[01:13:59.224 --> 01:13:59.765]  Armed Forces.
[01:13:59.965 --> 01:14:01.886]  Because they still say, do not listen to him.
[01:14:02.567 --> 01:14:03.988]  Do not listen to Ron Paul.
[01:14:04.108 --> 01:14:06.689]  Do not, do not get involved in the Tea Party.
[01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:08.651]  It's making them all run to it.
[01:14:10.089 --> 01:14:11.109]  What were they thinking?
[01:14:11.449 --> 01:14:13.990]  I mean, they're thinking they have control over the narrative.
[01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:16.031]  The narrative is fragmented.
[01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:19.031]  It used to be a sole control over the narrative, right?
[01:14:19.071 --> 01:14:28.414]  Like, when the Catholic priests spoke the liturgy in Latin in the Middle Ages, and the commoners didn't know Latin, and they couldn't get a hold of the Bible.
[01:14:28.934 --> 01:14:35.636]  And then Martin Luther comes along, translates it into a language they can see, and the monopoly of Christendom then fragments.
[01:14:35.836 --> 01:14:40.037]  Well that's like they'll have MSNBC or others go, Alex Jones has no listeners and is not important and is not on AM and FM stations.
[01:15:06.391 --> 01:15:10.860]  And then people go, look, I'm on over a hundred... But then he doesn't exist because he's not on media controlled by the government.
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:15.669]  But the difference is I'm on over a hundred and sixty, but we've been more successful in the free market internet.
[01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:18.374]  The point is, is that they lie incessantly.
[01:15:19.053 --> 01:15:19.193]  Yeah.
[01:15:19.413 --> 01:15:23.994]  They lie incessantly, and you're right, they operate like they think they're in a vacuum.
[01:15:24.074 --> 01:15:27.075]  You can lie if nobody can cross-check you, right?
[01:15:27.115 --> 01:15:32.756]  But people don't know, like, my website got banned in the armed services too, and the number of military listeners to my show went through the roof.
[01:15:32.876 --> 01:15:33.716]  Well, that's what I'm telling you.
[01:15:33.736 --> 01:15:37.637]  Didn't they know when they ordered the Pentagon in like 99, 2008?
[01:15:37.817 --> 01:15:44.679]  I mean, suddenly I had this giant audience, and suddenly I was being given all this info that turned out to be accurate.
[01:15:45.399 --> 01:15:47.340]  People leaking, you know, just basic stuff.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:49.000]  Not like secrets, but what was going on.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.201]  They didn't like the training they were being given to take on Americans.
[01:15:52.561 --> 01:15:53.842]  They heard a guy saying it was bad.
[01:15:54.102 --> 01:15:55.342]  They knew I was telling the truth.
[01:15:55.602 --> 01:15:57.063]  Then they're told, don't listen to this guy.
[01:15:57.783 --> 01:16:02.244]  Then they come in and say, you're going to get run or get PT duty if we find any more of these films here.
[01:16:02.764 --> 01:16:04.185]  Suddenly, everyone was watching them.
[01:16:05.605 --> 01:16:07.486]  I mean, what was the system thinking?
[01:16:07.626 --> 01:16:08.846]  It's the delusion of control.
[01:16:09.066 --> 01:16:10.087]  The technology has biased us.
[01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:11.227]  It's the Streisand effect.
[01:16:11.932 --> 01:16:12.432]  I'm sorry, what now?
[01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:17.555]  You know the Streisand effect where she kept threatening to sue bloggers, don't say where I live, don't talk about me?
[01:16:17.895 --> 01:16:20.116]  So it brought all this attention to it, made it a thousand times bigger?
[01:16:20.397 --> 01:16:21.577]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[01:16:21.597 --> 01:16:25.920]  But I'm saying, literally, that shows how screwed up these people are.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.261]  I mean, I don't mean to keep marveling about it, it's just that...
[01:16:30.087 --> 01:16:30.948]  What you're saying is true.
[01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:37.277]  Well, they inhabit the state, which is an institution that is so ancient it's ridiculous.
[01:16:37.297 --> 01:16:40.442]  It's just an outgrowth of warlords and witch doctors from the Stone Age.
[01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:44.988]  They inhabit the state, which is retro, and they have had so much monopoly control.
[01:16:45.769 --> 01:16:51.734]  Over the media, that I think that they still don't quite grasp just how porous information has become now.
[01:16:51.754 --> 01:16:51.874]  Sure.
[01:16:51.934 --> 01:16:57.458]  And how, I mean, you know, it's like you put a tiny pebble in a stream and you think you're damning the whole stream.
[01:16:57.519 --> 01:16:58.740]  No, everything just goes around it.
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:01.342]  I mean, there's no rock big enough to dam the floor.
[01:17:01.362 --> 01:17:02.262]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:17:02.342 --> 01:17:09.508]  I learned early on with stalkers or people in the media that make stuff up who wanted attention, smaller people than me making stuff up, don't respond, they go away.
[01:17:09.828 --> 01:17:12.651]  You give them attention, it gives them attention, they do it more.
[01:17:12.831 --> 01:17:12.951]  Yeah.
[01:17:14.282 --> 01:17:15.283]  I mean, that's 101.
[01:17:15.723 --> 01:17:16.844]  I'm not that smart, I know that.
[01:17:17.164 --> 01:17:18.585]  How can the system not know that?
[01:17:19.626 --> 01:17:23.068]  Well, remember, they're also playing to an older audience.
[01:17:23.168 --> 01:17:28.651]  I think younger people are much more open to principled ideas of freedom than older people, to some degree, to some degree.
[01:17:29.092 --> 01:17:36.236]  And I think what they're doing is they're playing to an audience that themselves do not understand how widely porous the flow of information has become.
[01:17:36.577 --> 01:17:40.259]  So what they're saying, the people are saying, well, we don't want our kids seeing these Second Amendment things.
[01:17:40.339 --> 01:17:43.181]  It's like, well, we just, we talked to Facebook and it's taken care of, and people are like,
[01:17:43.661 --> 01:17:49.987]  Hey, I'm over 50, that sounds plausible to me, because, you know, when they weren't allowed to show it on TV, they weren't allowed to show it on TV and nobody knew about it.
[01:17:50.087 --> 01:17:58.215]  Or when it wasn't allowed... Yeah, don't they get by banning Super Bowl ads that are pro-gun, by arresting kids that draw a picture of a gun at school, they only make it sexier?
[01:17:58.255 --> 01:18:05.181]  Because let me tell you, with the liberal trendies, the sexiest thing now is to go square dancing, two-stepping, buy guns, become a hillbilly.
[01:18:06.022 --> 01:18:07.703]  We're actually winning with the young liberals.
[01:18:07.723 --> 01:18:09.025]  They're waking up and becoming libertarians.
[01:18:09.525 --> 01:18:09.665]  Yeah.
[01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:12.789]  I don't know what's going to happen for the power structure because it's not going well.
[01:18:13.169 --> 01:18:18.695]  Well, the other thing too is that I think people, the government control of the schools have become so complete, so absolute.
[01:18:18.735 --> 01:18:22.539]  This started in the 60s when you could no longer fire teachers and it just became so absolute.
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:29.106]  And I don't think people really remember or understand that when young people think of the state, they think of the school.
[01:18:29.887 --> 01:18:34.009]  And the experiences they have in the school are so uniformly negative these days.
[01:18:34.049 --> 01:18:35.350]  I mean, it was pretty bad when I was there.
[01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:36.370]  It was horrible when I was there.
[01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:38.071]  Yeah, but it's become even worse now.
[01:18:38.391 --> 01:18:43.193]  Like, I mean, in the 30 years since I was in high school, I mean, it's become exponentially worse.
[01:18:43.253 --> 01:18:46.315]  Like now, as you know, they're built by the same people who build prisons.
[01:18:46.375 --> 01:18:48.015]  It's a mind-control facility.
[01:18:48.115 --> 01:18:48.696]  Yeah, it is.
[01:18:48.816 --> 01:18:49.136]  It is a...
[01:18:49.736 --> 01:18:50.116]  Prison.
[01:18:50.277 --> 01:18:52.539]  It is an actual prison that you're forced to go to.
[01:18:53.039 --> 01:18:56.483]  And so I think the government is used to this patriotic blah blah blah.
[01:18:56.523 --> 01:19:00.627]  But teenagers now understand that it's the government that runs their lives as teenagers.
[01:19:00.687 --> 01:19:02.148]  It's the government that makes them go to school.
[01:19:02.188 --> 01:19:03.870]  And they're rebelling against mommy and daddy now.
[01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:05.592]  But the state is their mommy and daddy.
[01:19:05.732 --> 01:19:06.913]  They're going to rebel against the state.
[01:19:07.153 --> 01:19:07.953]  Raised by the state.
[01:19:07.973 --> 01:19:11.274]  They've been put in state institutions from about the age of three or four onwards.
[01:19:11.654 --> 01:19:16.695]  And so when the state tells them stuff, all the rebellion that used to go to mom and dad in the fifties is now going to the state.
[01:19:16.735 --> 01:19:18.296]  What a beautiful situation to be in.
[01:19:18.316 --> 01:19:24.817]  What a great, fomenting, wonderful lava pool we've got to inject some reason and passion into and to wake people up.
[01:19:24.837 --> 01:19:27.138]  Because for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:19:27.158 --> 01:19:30.219]  Hey, imagine if high school went on forever.
[01:19:30.279 --> 01:19:31.779]  Well, welcome to the modern government.
[01:19:31.799 --> 01:19:35.920]  You know, boy, if that doesn't make... You know, I have a recurring nightmare that I still have where I'm back in high school.
[01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:39.124]  Do you still have that one where you didn't study for some test?
[01:19:39.164 --> 01:19:40.666]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:40.686 --> 01:19:44.011]  I'll be like, the nightmare is I'm 30 as a senior.
[01:19:44.591 --> 01:19:46.133]  And I'm like, my God, I'm an idiot.
[01:19:46.454 --> 01:19:47.395]  I've got to get out of here.
[01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:48.497]  That's a great line.
[01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:49.398]  Do the rest of the hour with us.
[01:19:49.458 --> 01:19:50.660]  You got some lunch coming for you.

[01:20:01.951 --> 01:20:02.611]  Yeah, yeah, okay.

[01:20:48.686 --> 01:20:49.426]  This capitalism?
[01:20:49.486 --> 01:20:55.588]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:23:08.835 --> 01:23:09.676]  The facts are in.
[01:23:09.856 --> 01:23:10.976]  The studies are legion.
[01:23:11.256 --> 01:23:18.620]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:22.242]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:23:22.602 --> 01:23:23.003]  Simple.
[01:23:23.183 --> 01:23:27.545]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:23:27.885 --> 01:23:33.348]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:23:33.588 --> 01:23:38.970]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:23:39.150 --> 01:23:49.595]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:23:49.915 --> 01:23:54.160]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.363]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:06.474]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:24:06.635 --> 01:24:07.916]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:24:22.862 --> 01:24:35.125]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:24:35.145 --> 01:24:41.326]  We're going to give you Stefan Molyneux's take on House of Cards that I have not yet watched, but everyone keeps telling me about, so...
[01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:49.116]  Most propaganda is in movies and TV, not in the news, and I'm kind of blind because I only focus on news.
[01:24:49.176 --> 01:24:55.521]  I should focus more on the propaganda in films, but that discussion coming up in the next segment after calls.
[01:24:55.621 --> 01:24:57.423]  Fred in Wisconsin, you're a trooper for holding.
[01:24:57.763 --> 01:24:58.944]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:24:58.964 --> 01:24:59.364]  Go ahead.
[01:25:00.745 --> 01:25:07.831]  Hey Alex, I wanted to ask you and your guest, you have an uncanny ability to predict the future based on the events going on right now.
[01:25:08.895 --> 01:25:37.461]  And I see all these young people in California signing up for these medical marijuana cards, and I see it spreading across the United States, and I believe that if legalization happens, if it really does come across, that this is going to lead to gun confiscation later, and that all these databases are being built because it's still against the federal law to have a gun and be under the influence of marijuana, regardless of what the states say.
[01:25:38.341 --> 01:25:42.342]  I think it's going to be a big problem, and I didn't get my first gun until I was 25.
[01:25:42.863 --> 01:25:50.305]  So, I think it's just going to lead to a future gun confiscation problem, especially if they lose all the money.
[01:25:50.665 --> 01:25:53.726]  Sure, sure, and I want to be clear about this whole gun issue.
[01:25:54.226 --> 01:26:06.890]  The guns are important, but the reason we obsess on it is when they come to try to take them, it's because they're going to take the First Amendment, the Fourth, the Tenth, everything else, which just symbolize rights that were already inalienable and already existed.
[01:26:07.674 --> 01:26:12.836]  And the point is, is that they go, oh, we're friends, just let us register them, and then they always confiscate them.
[01:26:13.536 --> 01:26:16.217]  And so, yes, undoubtedly the plan is to take our guns.
[01:26:17.117 --> 01:26:19.538]  But as Stefan said, so they have the monopoly.
[01:26:19.878 --> 01:26:21.138]  What's a bank robber do when he comes in?
[01:26:21.158 --> 01:26:23.739]  He says, hands up, and he takes the gun away from the security guard.
[01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.160]  I mean, that's what they're doing.
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:28.241]  They're securing what they've hijacked, what they've usurped.
[01:26:28.601 --> 01:26:31.962]  And I, at an instinctive level, do not want to be usurped, Stefan.
[01:26:33.098 --> 01:26:36.080]  You know that the system is about to crash when they try to grab the guns.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:38.041]  That is always what happens.
[01:26:38.462 --> 01:26:41.964]  Because when the system crashes, the dependent classes get kind of angry.
[01:26:42.344 --> 01:26:43.365]  Where's the welfare check?
[01:26:43.405 --> 01:26:45.126]  Where's the social security check?
[01:26:45.526 --> 01:26:47.748]  My money's being inflated right out of my bank account.
[01:26:47.788 --> 01:26:48.789]  I can't buy food.
[01:26:48.809 --> 01:26:50.610]  I mean, this is what happened in Ukraine.
[01:26:51.010 --> 01:26:54.653]  Ukraine, the average GDP per person is like 35 or
[01:26:55.573 --> 01:26:56.513]  And I want to explain something.
[01:26:56.534 --> 01:27:00.095]  It is massive centralization that allows runs on banks, that allows starvation, that allows deflation, inflation.
[01:27:24.225 --> 01:27:30.509]  If you have a truly diverse, free, multi-crop economy, you have some problems, but you just get richer and richer.
[01:27:30.949 --> 01:27:31.710]  History shows.
[01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:41.776]  The problem is ever getting to that point where you get government and regulators out of your hair and have a virtuous society, then it's like a perpetual motion machine.
[01:27:42.176 --> 01:27:43.336]  But again, then you become decadent.
[01:27:43.376 --> 01:27:44.177]  It's the same cycle.
[01:27:44.237 --> 01:27:44.857]  Anything else, Caller?
[01:27:46.338 --> 01:27:50.040]  I would just keep my name off that list as long as possible to see what they actually do.
[01:27:50.341 --> 01:27:52.202]  Well, yeah, I mean, folks, you can get guns.
[01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:54.343]  Anywhere in the U.S.
[01:27:54.363 --> 01:27:56.404]  without getting them through a registration system.
[01:27:56.424 --> 01:27:58.505]  In most areas it's legal to buy from a private seller.
[01:27:59.005 --> 01:28:02.267]  Me, I'm so prominent anyways, I go buy guns in the background and check why do I care.
[01:28:03.287 --> 01:28:05.729]  I don't think I even have hardly any guns that I bought from friends or family.
[01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:08.410]  And they can say anything's illegal too, nitpicking it.
[01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:11.372]  You know, it's... The cops show up and say, you know, you have a gun illegally.
[01:28:11.412 --> 01:28:11.852]  No, I don't.
[01:28:12.252 --> 01:28:14.713]  I don't have your, you know, your view that my gun's illegal.
[01:28:15.134 --> 01:28:17.015]  Because my grandpa gave it to me 30 years ago.
[01:28:17.055 --> 01:28:19.196]  You know, they can frame anything the way they want it to.
[01:28:20.393 --> 01:28:28.736]  Yeah, and I would strongly suggest that it's a great barometer of an economic catastrophe when the escalation of gun grabbing goes on.
[01:28:28.756 --> 01:28:32.317]  That's the time where you've got to start thinking about whatever savings you've got, whatever finances you've got.
[01:28:32.337 --> 01:28:34.338]  That's right, they're going to take everything else when they go for the guns.
[01:28:34.398 --> 01:28:36.079]  Robert in mass, you're on the air.
[01:28:36.099 --> 01:28:37.219]  It's the canary in the coal mine.
[01:28:37.239 --> 01:28:37.779]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.100]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:40.260]  I'm good, go ahead.
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.521]  I just want to say you're doing a great job.
[01:28:42.541 --> 01:28:45.322]  You're a true American patriot and the spirit of 76 lives on.
[01:28:45.842 --> 01:28:46.323]  Thank you, brother.
[01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:47.303]  What's your question or comment?
[01:28:47.918 --> 01:28:50.801]  Well, my question is about, first, the IRS.
[01:28:50.961 --> 01:28:52.242]  It's not a question, it's just a point.
[01:28:52.342 --> 01:28:53.544]  I'm from Massachusetts.
[01:28:53.564 --> 01:28:56.406]  We're under a form of Obamacare here already.
[01:28:56.426 --> 01:29:02.792]  And just to back up what you stated, that they are going to go after your bank accounts, they are going to go after your tax returns.
[01:29:02.853 --> 01:29:10.860]  That's already happening here in Massachusetts if you don't cover yourself for the year when you go to file your tax and they take it out of your tax return.
[01:29:13.394 --> 01:29:28.738]  My other point is, I'm a kind of hands-on guy, I like to get in people's faces, I call senators, I call congressmen on gun control, I call CNN, I call MSNBC, just to let these people know that there are people out there who do care about the Constitution.
[01:29:28.958 --> 01:29:34.299]  Oh, there are a lot of people that care, but you know, the bill, and now the IRS announced last week they're going to take the money out of your bank account.
[01:29:35.481 --> 01:29:37.585]  And they go, but Obama promised they wouldn't.
[01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:41.652]  Well, why do they have it in there to take $5,000 out then if they're not going to do it?
[01:29:42.233 --> 01:29:45.659]  But a politician promise is such a non-argument.
[01:29:45.719 --> 01:29:46.801]  I can't believe people call her.
[01:29:46.821 --> 01:29:48.083]  Did you have anything else you wanted to add?
[01:29:48.789 --> 01:29:55.654]  I just wanted to say what an excellent guest you have on and his take on what he thinks it's going to take to be American people to finally have enough.
[01:29:55.914 --> 01:29:56.275]  That's right.
[01:29:56.735 --> 01:29:58.496]  Will there be a big flashpoint or will it be gradual?
[01:29:58.937 --> 01:29:59.857]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.338 --> 01:30:01.939]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:05.562]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.662 --> 01:30:15.245]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:30:15.466 --> 01:30:22.670]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:25.992]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:30:26.192 --> 01:30:27.974]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:30:28.235 --> 01:30:32.800]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:35.643]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:30:35.803 --> 01:30:41.590]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:30:41.730 --> 01:30:45.213]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[01:30:45.413 --> 01:30:53.719]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:53.899 --> 01:30:59.763]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:30:59.883 --> 01:31:01.864]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[01:31:02.045 --> 01:31:07.468]  Secure your super high quality nascent iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:07.569 --> 01:31:08.929]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:11.411]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:15.172]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:31:15.312 --> 01:31:19.734]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:31:19.854 --> 01:31:25.856]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:31:25.976 --> 01:31:36.740]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:43.264]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:31:43.444 --> 01:32:00.433]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:32:00.774 --> 01:32:04.876]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarstore.com.
[01:32:05.396 --> 01:32:07.277]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:32:07.417 --> 01:32:10.358]  The facts are in.
[01:32:10.518 --> 01:32:11.659]  The studies are legion.
[01:32:11.939 --> 01:32:19.282]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:32:19.442 --> 01:32:22.883]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:32:23.243 --> 01:32:23.683]  Simple.
[01:32:23.824 --> 01:32:28.267]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:32:28.547 --> 01:32:34.010]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:32:34.271 --> 01:32:50.322]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:32:50.602 --> 01:32:52.443]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:32:52.543 --> 01:32:54.826]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:32:55.166 --> 01:32:57.008]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:32:57.329 --> 01:33:02.635]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:33:02.875 --> 01:33:07.140]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:33:07.301 --> 01:33:08.562]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[01:33:19.764 --> 01:33:23.754]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:23.854 --> 01:33:25.759]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.822]  Freedomainradio.com is his website.
[01:33:37.842 --> 01:33:38.462]  Stefan Molyneux.
[01:33:38.482 --> 01:33:51.753]  We're going to continue with your phone calls with Todd and everybody else that's holding after we do our review of House of Cards that I've not watched yet, but I know this whole global system is a House of Cards, that when it comes down, we don't want to be crushed by.
[01:33:51.773 --> 01:34:02.801]  That's what this is all about, is putting out our ideas so that when it all collapses, people know that we were right, and there's an alternative to this system that we've been under, and we can have a new renaissance, a new enlightenment.
[01:34:03.262 --> 01:34:04.302]  Before I go any further,
[01:34:05.223 --> 01:34:09.847]  We have some amazing specials going right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:34:09.887 --> 01:34:17.173]  We have the entire family of Pro-Pure, Pro-1, 2.0 systems that cut out the fluoride, the glyphosates.
[01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:23.057]  I carry the Pro-Pure systems because it's the best gravity-fed stainless steel system out there.
[01:34:23.518 --> 01:34:31.024]  It blows the competition away, side-by-side comparisons, and it costs the same or less as its leading competitor.
[01:34:31.664 --> 01:34:42.694]  Pro One available at InfowarsStore.com and stop drinking the Roundup, stop drinking the hydrofluorosilicic acid and the BPA and all the crap that's in the water.
[01:34:42.975 --> 01:34:47.218]  Whether you got well water, you name it, rain water, you need to filter your water.
[01:34:47.278 --> 01:34:50.642]  It's a win-win and then it funds this operation, our free speech.
[01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:54.425]  It does tens of thousands of gallons for the smaller filters, even more with the bigger ones.
[01:34:54.865 --> 01:34:56.147]  They've got a pitcher model.
[01:34:56.747 --> 01:34:58.207]  Uh, that is incredibly inexpensive.
[01:34:58.227 --> 01:35:00.828]  The same price as a charcoal filter that doesn't cut anything out.
[01:35:00.908 --> 01:35:01.468]  Just flavor.
[01:35:01.928 --> 01:35:03.409]  Cuts out, you know, bad stuff that tastes bad.
[01:35:03.429 --> 01:35:05.789]  This has filters in it that actually cuts it all out.
[01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:08.150]  It's just an amazing system.
[01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:11.330]  You know, I didn't sell filters for a couple years just because I couldn't find them that were good enough.
[01:35:11.831 --> 01:35:13.411]  We'd have customer service complaints, problems.
[01:35:13.431 --> 01:35:16.292]  I don't know what was going on, but we carry a couple brands.
[01:35:16.532 --> 01:35:17.292]  Pro1's the best.
[01:35:17.992 --> 01:35:19.613]  That we've gotten great reviews from and that I use.
[01:35:19.633 --> 01:35:23.274]  We have the LifeStraw at the lowest price that we're allowed to advertise it for.
[01:35:23.294 --> 01:35:25.636]  And your purchase makes the transmission possible.
[01:35:25.916 --> 01:35:30.598]  So all your water filter needs, InfowarsStore.com or call toll free.
[01:35:31.895 --> 01:35:33.216]  888-253-3139.

[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:45.221]  Not a gun to your head like the IRS taking our money and giving it to state-run media.
[01:35:45.462 --> 01:35:47.042]  We're here saying, hey, we carry great products.
[01:35:47.422 --> 01:35:48.423]  If you believe in them, buy them.
[01:35:48.443 --> 01:35:50.104]  If you believe in what we're doing, support us.
[01:35:50.204 --> 01:35:52.325]  I mean, take the Supermail Vitality with eight
[01:35:52.865 --> 01:35:56.589]  Concentrated organic herbs known to help block estrogen membranes.
[01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:58.672]  I mean, people take it, they're just completely blown away.
[01:35:58.692 --> 01:36:02.016]  I mean, look at me, I was like a fat slob, and I still am somewhat of a job of the hut.
[01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:06.341]  I mean, I got a little bit of a potbelly left, folks, but I mean, I've lost a ton of weight.
[01:36:06.381 --> 01:36:07.101]  Everybody can see it.
[01:36:07.542 --> 01:36:09.824]  I mean, I'm in here, camera adds 10 pounds to you, but I mean, I'm...
[01:36:10.385 --> 01:36:12.126]  Get ready to take some photos with the shirt off, folks.
[01:36:12.186 --> 01:36:19.468]  I've lost a ton of weight, and it's given me the stamina, the energy to do it, along with the other great supplements we have at Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:20.268 --> 01:36:20.749]  15% off.
[01:36:20.769 --> 01:36:23.510]  We're still running that special because it's been so popular.
[01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:25.030]  We sold out, but more came in.
[01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:26.871]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:27.131 --> 01:36:28.791]  It's always on the same store.

[01:36:30.292 --> 01:36:31.352]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:31.732 --> 01:36:32.553]  On Infowarsstore.com.

[01:36:38.355 --> 01:36:47.340]  And regardless, when you get the survival shield, the fluoride shield, detoxifier, the super male vitality, all of it, it funds our operation so you win, period.
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:49.041]  Through free association.
[01:36:49.561 --> 01:36:50.322]  That's what it's all about.
[01:36:50.702 --> 01:36:53.083]  Voting for organic food by buying organic food.
[01:36:53.403 --> 01:36:56.865]  You then displace all the inorganic food to where those people are going bankrupt.
[01:36:57.886 --> 01:37:03.069]  It's the power of voting with choice, and that's what we rely on and what has sustained us.
[01:37:03.409 --> 01:37:10.953]  And while the system is trying to wreck the free market, the remnants of it, it's still empowering civilization and society.
[01:37:11.013 --> 01:37:17.897]  So, you can also call the toll-free number for any questions, or to order via telephone, the t-shirts, the books, the films, the Molon Labe, 888.
[01:37:19.718 --> 01:37:20.518]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9-8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:37:20.538 --> 01:37:30.561]  And when you go over and watch the podcast with Stefan Molyneux on his site, that's supporting the free market of ideas.
[01:37:30.581 --> 01:37:40.304]  When you pass on his podcast, when you pass on our podcast, when you tell friends and family about the different radio shows and books, all of that is little individual actions.
[01:37:40.504 --> 01:37:41.665]  We're not in some vacuum.
[01:37:41.705 --> 01:37:47.907]  We're just the kleptocrats and people that think in gang mentality, who aren't creative and gang up to rob us that are creative.
[01:37:48.907 --> 01:37:51.009]  We're better than them when we take the field.
[01:37:51.930 --> 01:37:52.871]  Our ideas win.
[01:37:52.991 --> 01:37:53.892]  I've experienced it.
[01:37:54.793 --> 01:37:58.276]  And there are a lot more articulate, better folks than me out there who just don't have confidence in themselves.
[01:37:58.556 --> 01:38:00.698]  I've been on air 19 years from nowhere, folks.
[01:38:01.059 --> 01:38:04.042]  With Free Association, we reach 3 million people.
[01:38:04.082 --> 01:38:05.063]  That's a conservative number.
[01:38:05.483 --> 01:38:06.184]  Every day.
[01:38:06.664 --> 01:38:07.405]  And we're growing.
[01:38:08.914 --> 01:38:12.338]  And freedom is popular, and we can legalize freedom, as Ron Paul says.
[01:38:12.718 --> 01:38:14.240]  We can have a debate about what freedom is.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.365]  Total anarchic capitalism, like Stefan Molyneux, or me just saying, hey, I want my republic back.
[01:38:19.405 --> 01:38:21.187]  It's better than being run by foreign banks.
[01:38:21.928 --> 01:38:25.112]  Just don't blame the republic, as they do, for what our society's turned into.
[01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:30.678]  Now, I'm going to go back to calls, but if you want to comment on voting with our dollars, I'd like to get that, and then... I've never heard.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:32.620]  It's such a buzz.
[01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:36.882]  It's about House of Cards and people on the street going, it's what you say about them.
[01:38:37.323 --> 01:38:43.025]  I don't know how it's on Netflix, but that shows the model of a Netflix platform, five years old, dominating everything.
[01:38:43.045 --> 01:38:45.226]  A hundred million viewers a week, that show alone.
[01:38:45.246 --> 01:38:48.788]  I keep telling people, don't try to go to Hollywood to be successful.
[01:38:49.048 --> 01:38:54.191]  Go make your own film with passion and it'll pay for itself and the next film will make money.
[01:38:54.591 --> 01:38:56.112]  But so many people just want to go
[01:38:56.952 --> 01:39:05.741]  Make it and be rich with no passion, and then they'll be a bling-bling hip-hop star, or they'll be a movie star, not getting that the journey is the destination.
[01:39:06.121 --> 01:39:11.487]  So, House of Cards with a 9.0 rating on IMDb, almost unheard of.
[01:39:11.867 --> 01:39:13.409]  What is your take on this phenomenon?
[01:39:14.147 --> 01:39:15.428]  Well, it's free market art.
[01:39:15.808 --> 01:39:18.449]  It's art without a license, because it's coming through Netflix.
[01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:20.069]  There's no FCC.
[01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:21.050]  There's nothing like that.
[01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:30.834]  I had a guy talking about a good documentary called Divorce Corps about family courts and just how unbelievably predation, what predation they have, particularly on the American male in the divorce situation.
[01:39:31.154 --> 01:39:36.516]  And he was pointing out, like, no TV studio can accurately portray judicial corruption.
[01:39:37.156 --> 01:39:41.978]  Because networks are getting sued all the time and the last thing they want to do is piss off judges.
[01:39:41.998 --> 01:39:45.639]  They're going to sit in front of some judge who's going to remember them and judge against them, right?
[01:39:46.039 --> 01:39:56.523]  So this is Netflix streaming directly through the internet, bypassing the FCC, bypassing the regulators, and so they can put out an honest-to-goodness portrayal of, I think, what politics looks like.
[01:39:56.563 --> 01:39:58.264]  You compare this to something like the West Wing.
[01:39:59.004 --> 01:40:05.707]  Which was Aaron Sorkin's drama about Democrats in the White House, which was state-humping demo porn from, you know, a couple of decades ago.
[01:40:06.228 --> 01:40:08.989]  This is the true face of politics.
[01:40:09.049 --> 01:40:13.411]  This is the backstabbing, the evil, the monstrosity, the hypocrisy.
[01:40:13.431 --> 01:40:20.195]  I mean, it's like Othello, where you had Iago as the bad guy, making Othello into a bad guy, but there's no good guy in this whole thing.
[01:40:20.415 --> 01:40:21.435]  And it's the Democrats!
[01:40:22.035 --> 01:40:26.758]  Because normally you get left-wing writers, if they have to portray bad people in politics, they make them Republicans.
[01:40:27.538 --> 01:40:34.441]  But these are Democrats, and it is showing just how corrupt the system is, how unsustainable the system is.
[01:40:35.221 --> 01:40:39.643]  And it's not even backroom deals for the sake of any advancing agenda.
[01:40:39.743 --> 01:40:44.284]  It's not like they want to do good things and they have to regretfully do bad things to get those good things going.
[01:40:44.685 --> 01:40:49.166]  They only pretend they want to do good things in order to advance their own personal power and agenda.
[01:40:49.206 --> 01:40:53.408]  And I think that is an accurate view, and I think it's going to really color and condition
[01:40:54.048 --> 01:41:00.137]  Particularly young people's view of what it is to be in politics and what the government really looks like from the inside.
[01:41:00.197 --> 01:41:01.379]  I think it's very powerful.
[01:41:01.619 --> 01:41:06.266]  But you said it yourself, because I talked to a lot of people that say, man, this is really accurate.
[01:41:06.306 --> 01:41:08.990]  And by the way, this is what you're saying about the government, Alex.
[01:41:10.472 --> 01:41:15.076]  It's a sign that the whole wall of Hollywood control is imploding.
[01:41:15.096 --> 01:41:22.682]  I was talking about this the last few months, and I've had a lot of big Hollywood people and rock stars contact me and say, man, you don't know how true what you're saying is.
[01:41:23.142 --> 01:41:30.308]  When I'm out in Hollywood, and I've been to a lot of big A-list parties and stuff back when I would even go do that, now I realize nothing ever really comes of it, so why go out there?
[01:41:30.328 --> 01:41:34.451]  Because I used to go out there to be on big national TV shows, and that doesn't really do anything, so what's the point?
[01:41:36.144 --> 01:41:55.389]  I would go out there, and people weren't liberal, they weren't conservative, they were libertarian, they know the systems of fraud, they want freedom for their kids, they know GMOs bad, they're liberal on some issues, conservative on others, those traditional issues, they've all got guns, even if they claim they're anti-gun, because the studio won't put you on if you don't toe the line.
[01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:59.290]  And the few people that would come on my show, literally would get called in.
[01:41:59.810 --> 01:42:01.972]  And told you're never going to work again if you don't stop that.
[01:42:02.332 --> 01:42:06.374]  If you want to be part of a libertarian group, you've got to be literally in a secret society in Hollywood.
[01:42:06.715 --> 01:42:21.645]  But the truth is, because they haven't let them be libertarian, or what they call conspiracy theorists, people that question known liars, the hottest thing for, I don't know, eight years, it was about eight years ago, and that's where we're getting invited out there a lot by a lot of people.
[01:42:21.685 --> 01:42:23.446]  It was just a few folks that were willing to go on the show.
[01:42:25.008 --> 01:42:35.757]  And I'm telling you, across the board, but some of them like Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie that I know woke up and saw my films and Aaron Russo's, I'll leave it at that, and were awake.
[01:42:35.817 --> 01:42:37.578]  They got freaked out and went and joined the UN.
[01:42:38.158 --> 01:42:42.362]  See, some of them go, okay, it is all rigged, I will literally go sell out to it.
[01:42:42.622 --> 01:42:42.782]  Sure.
[01:42:43.062 --> 01:42:45.784]  Or they argue, well, I'll do more better, you know, inside the system.
[01:42:46.165 --> 01:42:52.850]  But what I'm saying is, the whole facade of Sumner Redstone and all these top lawyers and people that I've had meetings with,
[01:42:54.105 --> 01:43:02.992]  Literally is about keeping people on the plantation and mind control to keep Hollywood under the fake liberal progressive authoritarianism.
[01:43:03.532 --> 01:43:05.013]  The facade has already fallen.
[01:43:05.193 --> 01:43:05.353]  Yeah.
[01:43:05.634 --> 01:43:08.736]  And they're now figuring out they can go out and say and do what they want.
[01:43:09.696 --> 01:43:14.398]  And I'm telling you, House of Cards, I believe, is then going to be seen as the dam breaking.
[01:43:14.718 --> 01:43:16.479]  So I want to declare, they're dead.
[01:43:16.739 --> 01:43:18.180]  Hollywood, as the L.A.
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:23.022]  Mayor said a few months ago, is quote, in an emergency and is bankrupt and is in a crisis.
[01:43:23.042 --> 01:43:23.562]  You bet.
[01:43:23.622 --> 01:43:24.003]  It's over.
[01:43:24.443 --> 01:43:24.843]  It's over.
[01:43:25.303 --> 01:43:28.045]  It's over for them, and mainstream media is over.
[01:43:28.265 --> 01:43:29.345]  The dinosaur media is over.
[01:43:29.365 --> 01:43:33.588]  But the next thing to fully implode, I'm saying, is Hollywood.
[01:43:33.608 --> 01:43:34.729]  And now they're finally desperate.
[01:43:35.009 --> 01:43:37.570]  Or Man of Steel as decentralized anti-eugenics.
[01:43:38.150 --> 01:43:40.672]  And movies like Nut Job or Antigen to 21.
[01:43:41.172 --> 01:43:43.534]  Now suddenly, or the Lego movie is libertarian.
[01:43:45.134 --> 01:43:45.655]  Suddenly.
[01:43:46.678 --> 01:43:54.621]  Though, in their death throes, they're allowing the directors, I've talked to some of them, to actually go be pro-Liberty, and those are the only films that are making it now.
[01:43:54.962 --> 01:44:01.865]  So instead of Hollywood just collapsing, they can either collapse, or Hollywood can make the decision to survive and join with Liberty.
[01:44:02.185 --> 01:44:03.645]  But they've now reached that tipping point.
[01:44:03.685 --> 01:44:04.526]  What do you think's going to happen?
[01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:06.391]  Well, they'll follow the dollar.
[01:44:06.491 --> 01:44:09.733]  This is what you were saying when talking about the products that you sell.
[01:44:09.793 --> 01:44:14.336]  You know, everything you subsidize grows and everything you don't subsidize shrinks.
[01:44:14.396 --> 01:44:16.818]  So, I mean, in terms of giving money to people, right?
[01:44:16.858 --> 01:44:19.219]  So, whatever you subsidize is going to grow.
[01:44:19.279 --> 01:44:24.122]  So, yeah, if people want libertarian messages, then the people in Hollywood will change to reflect that.
[01:44:24.543 --> 01:44:28.225]  Don't go and spend your money on stuff that promotes an immoral agenda.
[01:44:28.285 --> 01:44:29.386]  It's very fundamental.
[01:44:29.406 --> 01:44:29.766]  You know, you
[01:44:29.966 --> 01:44:31.507]  They've been wagging the dog here.
[01:44:31.568 --> 01:44:32.709]  It's time for us to wag them.
[01:44:32.749 --> 01:44:33.750]  You vote with the dollar.
[01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:37.773]  I mean, in House of Cards, I'm not going to give any spoilers, so don't panic about that.
[01:44:38.494 --> 01:44:44.599]  The rich guy says to the Vice President, you are about to make an enemy of a man with $40 billion.
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:47.902]  And he says, what do I care about your money?
[01:44:47.922 --> 01:44:50.084]  I have the guys with all the guns.
[01:44:51.297 --> 01:44:56.439]  That is a very powerful statement to come out of mainstream media, or at least as mainstream as it's going to get.
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:58.781]  That is an incredibly powerful statement to come out.
[01:44:58.861 --> 01:45:00.862]  He's saying, I have all the guns.
[01:45:00.942 --> 01:45:01.862]  That's what government is.
[01:45:01.942 --> 01:45:02.802]  It's not your protector.
[01:45:02.842 --> 01:45:03.723]  It's not your savior.
[01:45:03.763 --> 01:45:05.244]  It's not the salvation of the poor.
[01:45:05.564 --> 01:45:06.624]  It's not the healer of the sick.
[01:45:06.664 --> 01:45:08.785]  It's not Jesus walking on water to bring you a donut.
[01:45:09.185 --> 01:45:11.186]  It is the guys with all the guns.
[01:45:11.567 --> 01:45:12.627]  And that's all it is.
[01:45:12.647 --> 01:45:13.788]  That's all it's ever been.
[01:45:14.048 --> 01:45:16.149]  And the fact that it actually has been said
[01:45:16.849 --> 01:45:23.461]  To the general public in one of the most popular shows to come out in the last year, I have all the guys with the guns.
[01:45:25.071 --> 01:45:29.935]  I mean, it's something I've been saying for like 30 years, and now I can see it actually coming out.
[01:45:30.015 --> 01:45:32.497]  Government's a gang with a flag.
[01:45:32.537 --> 01:45:35.300]  They are the, you know, they're the disorganized crime.
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.021]  Organized crime is the mafia government.
[01:45:37.041 --> 01:45:38.382]  They're just the better criminals, right?
[01:45:38.402 --> 01:45:40.564]  Like the guys who own the banks are the better bank robbers.
[01:45:41.064 --> 01:45:44.027]  The guys who run the government are the better organized criminals.
[01:45:44.387 --> 01:45:46.949]  They just, they won, and they get to run the show.
[01:45:47.049 --> 01:45:51.914]  And the fact that it's actually being talked about, and there is this complete, it might as well be a mock movie.
[01:45:52.054 --> 01:45:53.455]  And it's incredibly popular.
[01:45:53.815 --> 01:45:55.256]  Yes, it is incredibly popular.
[01:45:55.476 --> 01:45:59.638]  And even the name of it, House of Cards, it's all about to come down.
[01:45:59.738 --> 01:46:05.641]  And what a wonderful thing it has been to be right for 30 years and have the credibility of accurately predicting catastrophe.
[01:46:05.961 --> 01:46:10.984]  Because it's really hard to argue with people who've been saying the non-obvious for 30 years who turn out to be completely right.
[01:46:11.024 --> 01:46:11.745]  And I think that this...
[01:46:12.905 --> 01:46:16.527]  There's no future in the universe of House of Cards.
[01:46:16.707 --> 01:46:19.768]  It is all just circling the drain, grab as much as you can.
[01:46:19.788 --> 01:46:25.710]  It's like Indiana Jones, like when the door is coming down, you just grab whatever gold you can stuff in your pockets and try and get out.
[01:46:26.091 --> 01:46:29.212]  The days are numbered, and this is why the anti-gun stuff is so strong.
[01:46:29.292 --> 01:46:32.233]  Well, the elites are all running to armored redoubts in the middle of nowhere.
[01:46:32.493 --> 01:46:37.294]  They're already running down the temple hallway with the big rock rolling towards them.
[01:46:37.354 --> 01:46:37.594]  Right.
[01:46:38.174 --> 01:46:39.475]  And they're telling us to be calm, though.
[01:46:39.815 --> 01:46:40.135]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:40.155 --> 01:46:42.476]  Because they don't want us to run for the exits and block their exit.
[01:46:42.536 --> 01:46:43.516]  Buy some government bonds.
[01:46:43.576 --> 01:46:45.236]  It's a really great investment.
[01:46:45.476 --> 01:46:47.057]  They have bonds in Canada, the 75-year bonds.
[01:46:48.157 --> 01:46:53.058]  I mean, does anyone seriously think that this system is going to be around in 75 years to pay off that principle?
[01:46:53.118 --> 01:46:53.878]  It's mad!
[01:46:54.038 --> 01:47:00.140]  But what does it say that I could produce something like Loose Change, seen over 150 million times, downloaded?
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.301]  I mean, I helped produce those.
[01:47:03.281 --> 01:47:04.081]  What was the producer?
[01:47:04.681 --> 01:47:11.903]  That I can make films, I'm not bragging, but literally, I've made films that have been seen 50, 60 million times myself, a piece, just on YouTube and Google.
[01:47:13.063 --> 01:47:13.743]  And I'm nobody.
[01:47:14.204 --> 01:47:18.026]  Imagine when that paradigm finally shifts and people realize they don't have to run to L.A.
[01:47:18.046 --> 01:47:19.707]  to try to go make their movies.
[01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:26.852]  When everyone starts making them themselves and all that new talent gets turned list, it's a new renaissance on every front.
[01:47:27.192 --> 01:47:35.818]  I don't think the globalists can stop human progress unless one of their little experiments or a war they start ends up, you know, killing everybody.
[01:47:36.178 --> 01:47:41.622]  I just hope that collectively, through individual action, we can block them from blowing the planet up.
[01:47:42.239 --> 01:47:43.080]  That's what we have to do.
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:45.061]  I mean, people ask me, where does the future go?
[01:47:45.101 --> 01:47:48.164]  The future goes where the most passionate and virtuous people tell it to go.
[01:47:48.444 --> 01:47:49.044]  It's up to us.
[01:47:49.104 --> 01:47:49.745]  It's up to the people.
[01:47:49.825 --> 01:47:50.686]  I mean, where does the future go?
[01:47:50.706 --> 01:47:51.506]  It's where I want it to go.
[01:47:51.526 --> 01:47:52.307]  It's where you want it to go.
[01:47:52.327 --> 01:47:53.548]  It's where these listeners want it to go.
[01:47:53.628 --> 01:47:54.729]  That's where the future goes.
[01:47:55.249 --> 01:47:59.112]  And my experience was, you know, I struggled through graduate school in
[01:47:59.192 --> 01:47:59.612]  I don't know.
[01:48:14.708 --> 01:48:19.191]  Now, I do, I don't have your reach, I've got three to four million downloads a month of a philosophy show.
[01:48:19.271 --> 01:48:20.452]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[01:48:20.492 --> 01:48:24.455]  The fact that I can actually talk to people now... Yeah, top philosophers in the world can't get that.
[01:48:24.715 --> 01:48:26.676]  But you go out in the free market, boom, you win.
[01:48:27.076 --> 01:48:28.937]  It shows, they can't pick the winners.
[01:48:29.458 --> 01:48:31.479]  Look at, more and more they can't, they're out of bullets.
[01:48:31.779 --> 01:48:33.901]  Look at how they try to make Hillary like a movie star.
[01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:36.822]  CNN, MSNBC, she's so beautiful, she's so glamorous.
[01:48:37.062 --> 01:48:39.182]  No wonder you're tanking like a lead balloon in the ratings.
[01:48:39.502 --> 01:48:43.543]  Trying to make Michelle Obama look like a reanimated snapping turtle.
[01:48:44.223 --> 01:48:45.404]  You know, how beautiful she is.
[01:48:45.864 --> 01:48:49.144]  I mean, it's literally a bunch of narcissistic criminals.
[01:48:49.565 --> 01:48:53.665]  At least the old-fashioned kleptocrats need to stay quiet and shut up and just look stately.
[01:48:53.986 --> 01:48:59.007]  They actually want to be on red carpets and parade around in front of us in some Edward Bernays type deal.
[01:48:59.047 --> 01:48:59.727]  It's not working!
[01:49:00.507 --> 01:49:02.689]  No, I think it's better if they don't talk so much.
[01:49:02.729 --> 01:49:06.471]  You know, it's like that really pretty but dumb girlfriend everyone has at one time in their life or another.
[01:49:06.491 --> 01:49:08.352]  It's like, I'll introduce you to my friends.
[01:49:08.492 --> 01:49:11.114]  If you could just smile and not talk too much, that would be excellent.
[01:49:11.154 --> 01:49:18.039]  Well, I mean, look, it's one thing if scumbag rock and roll people or whatever want to show off with a bunch of women in a jet and bling.
[01:49:18.059 --> 01:49:20.561]  People kind of go, oh, that's rock stars or that's hip hop people.
[01:49:20.621 --> 01:49:21.261]  It's still cheesy.
[01:49:21.661 --> 01:49:29.967]  But when the president and his whole camp followers are strutting around in red carpets and I'm good at killing people and look how sexy my wife is.
[01:49:30.787 --> 01:49:32.169]  I mean, it's delusion.
[01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:37.594]  Don't they know people don't want to look at you in a taxpayer-paid red carpet?
[01:49:38.414 --> 01:49:39.355]  We're sick of you!
[01:49:39.775 --> 01:49:41.896]  Well, but they live in the bubble of privilege, right?
[01:49:41.916 --> 01:49:42.836]  They live in the bubble.
[01:49:42.896 --> 01:49:45.457]  I can't picture what it's like to be on the other side of the gun.
[01:49:45.678 --> 01:49:51.901]  Because, you know, my whole life, when I was a kid, you know, you go to school, you pay your taxes, obey the law, you sit this side of the gun.
[01:49:51.941 --> 01:49:52.981]  Gun pointing straight at you, right?
[01:49:53.041 --> 01:49:53.721]  Barrel straight at you.
[01:49:54.182 --> 01:49:57.903]  I can't even imagine what it must be like, Alex, to be on the other side of that gun.
[01:49:58.123 --> 01:49:59.824]  In other words, people have to watch your show.
[01:50:00.044 --> 01:50:01.145]  People have to give you money.
[01:50:01.465 --> 01:50:02.646]  People have to do what you say.
[01:50:02.706 --> 01:50:04.146]  Like, I can't imagine, but it must be.
[01:50:04.166 --> 01:50:07.088]  That would be like a woman having sex with me who didn't want to.
[01:50:07.668 --> 01:50:08.248]  Yeah.
[01:50:08.268 --> 01:50:08.868]  That's horrible.
[01:50:10.969 --> 01:50:12.550]  We have some compassion, some empathy and all that.
[01:50:12.570 --> 01:50:15.391]  Well, no, I mean, the point is I want her to be passionate and like me.
[01:50:16.371 --> 01:50:18.052]  I want them out of free association.
[01:50:18.072 --> 01:50:19.552]  The government is raping us.
[01:50:19.592 --> 01:50:20.232]  They want to go.
[01:50:20.252 --> 01:50:21.193]  They want to rape us.
[01:50:21.353 --> 01:50:22.673]  They want to go back into power.
[01:50:22.693 --> 01:50:23.574]  This is what it like for me.
[01:50:23.594 --> 01:50:23.994]  No, I know.
[01:50:24.014 --> 01:50:25.634]  But I'm saying they want to make us.
[01:50:25.654 --> 01:50:26.114]  Oh, I know.
[01:50:26.635 --> 01:50:27.035]  It's rape.
[01:50:27.135 --> 01:50:27.475]  It's rape.
[01:50:28.055 --> 01:50:32.917]  That's because they know they have nothing of value to add, but their vanity can't accept that, so they have to force it on us.
[01:50:33.297 --> 01:50:38.619]  For me, being in power, be like, take a wild ferret and up into an aquarium and put it in that wild ferret.
[01:50:38.659 --> 01:50:40.820]  That ferret's gonna be like, ah, gotta get out.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:43.702]  I mean, you put me in power for a day, I'm clawing to get out.
[01:50:43.762 --> 01:50:46.943]  These people work night and day for years to get back into power.
[01:50:46.983 --> 01:50:48.804]  I mean, it's like they're a completely different species.
[01:50:49.604 --> 01:50:51.565]  And then you study how they live, they're actually prisoners.
[01:50:52.532 --> 01:50:53.252]  In some ways, yeah.
[01:50:53.272 --> 01:50:55.673]  Yeah, uh-oh, because the bureaucracy is the real power.
[01:50:56.033 --> 01:50:56.974]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:56.994 --> 01:50:59.154]  We're gonna come in and jam in some phone calls, I promise.
[01:50:59.194 --> 01:51:00.795]  Todd, you're up next.
[01:51:00.895 --> 01:51:04.816]  And then... And then... There's two Todds.
[01:51:04.836 --> 01:51:07.037]  That's why I'm gonna get Todd in Texas and Todd in Canada.
[01:51:07.937 --> 01:51:08.718]  The two Todds.
[01:51:08.878 --> 01:51:09.458]  Straight ahead and...
[01:51:10.973 --> 01:51:12.373]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[01:51:12.493 --> 01:51:15.174]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[01:51:15.334 --> 01:51:19.995]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[01:51:20.175 --> 01:51:25.356]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.

[01:52:08.010 --> 01:52:09.151]  Survive to fish.
[01:52:09.531 --> 01:52:10.992]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:52:11.272 --> 01:52:14.373]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:52:14.713 --> 01:52:15.733]  A pair of scissors.
[01:52:15.993 --> 01:52:20.915]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making an easy for him.
[01:52:21.095 --> 01:52:25.417]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:52:25.777 --> 01:52:26.637]  The phone line.
[01:52:26.797 --> 01:52:32.139]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:52:32.439 --> 01:52:36.019]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.200]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:42.281]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[01:54:13.052 --> 01:54:20.974]  Five minutes overdrive with Stefan Molyneux on the nightly news tonight, talking about the war on men, the subject of the new March issue of InfoWars magazine.
[01:54:21.434 --> 01:54:25.235]  Canadian Mounties override civilian rule to arbitrarily ban and confiscate firearms.
[01:54:25.255 --> 01:54:28.116]  That just broke minutes ago on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:28.516 --> 01:54:33.117]  Showdown, Maryland to target and confiscate 110,000 citizens' firearms.
[01:54:33.737 --> 01:54:37.378]  Video, Bloomberg wants to ban free speech on Facebook, unbelievable.
[01:54:38.278 --> 01:54:41.060]  That is just some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:45.784]  Government, police fund, radar, crowd scanner, detect 3D, printed weapons.
[01:54:45.844 --> 01:54:51.347]  And we have like a gun theme today that just, without me even telling my writer, just a theme appears of what's happening sometimes.
[01:54:51.888 --> 01:54:52.488]  Very serious.
[01:54:52.508 --> 01:54:53.589]  Let's jam in some calls.
[01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:54.790]  For Stefan Molyneux.
[01:54:55.190 --> 01:54:56.971]  Todd in Texas, then Todd in Canada.
[01:54:57.352 --> 01:54:58.232]  You're on the air, Todd.
[01:54:58.853 --> 01:54:59.833]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[01:55:00.654 --> 01:55:02.615]  I talked a little bit about the IRS and
[01:55:04.205 --> 01:55:05.165]  The veil coming off.
[01:55:06.125 --> 01:55:08.546]  I think it came off with a loud thud on the floor.
[01:55:08.746 --> 01:55:11.866]  And I don't think anybody even looked to see what it was.
[01:55:14.667 --> 01:55:15.367]  No, I hear you.
[01:55:15.947 --> 01:55:20.528]  They declare the 5th when they're committing crimes, but then they don't let us declare the 5th in IRS forms.
[01:55:20.548 --> 01:55:21.388]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[01:55:22.088 --> 01:55:25.249]  And the next thing, everyone's saying they want to take your guns.
[01:55:25.609 --> 01:55:27.209]  I don't believe they want to take your guns at all.
[01:55:28.369 --> 01:55:29.109]  Not for one minute.
[01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:30.610]  Well, they're trying to confiscate them.
[01:55:30.630 --> 01:55:31.690]  Everywhere they get control, they do.
[01:55:32.907 --> 01:55:34.127]  No, I believe that's a ruse.
[01:55:34.227 --> 01:55:36.468]  I believe they don't want to take your guns.
[01:55:37.148 --> 01:55:38.668]  They want you to use your guns.
[01:55:38.988 --> 01:55:42.549]  And then they can blame the economic collapse on you.
[01:55:44.630 --> 01:55:49.211]  Well, when there is a large economic collapse, it'll be guns that maintain order, like in the L.A.
[01:55:49.251 --> 01:55:50.291]  riots when the cops left.
[01:55:50.311 --> 01:55:52.231]  So I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:55:52.391 --> 01:55:57.733]  Before we go to the other Todd, let's talk to Raymond, listening on 1530 AM in Chicago.
[01:55:57.833 --> 01:55:58.973]  Raymond, you're on the air.
[01:55:58.993 --> 01:55:59.273]  Go ahead.
[01:56:00.635 --> 01:56:01.115]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:01.655 --> 01:56:11.300]  I was calling in regards to the gun confiscation and them talking about, you know, even using the word gun for the younger people.
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:15.082]  Yeah, that's now a thought crime according to our dictator Bloomberg, yes.
[01:56:16.222 --> 01:56:22.205]  So, what are they gonna... I mean, then they should outlaw all these shoot-em-up games then.
[01:56:23.339 --> 01:56:23.739]  Oh, no, no.
[01:56:23.939 --> 01:56:30.581]  They're allowed to have shoot-em-up games violently on the Super Bowl, but a pro-gun thing about men protecting their household that doesn't even show a gun?
[01:56:30.981 --> 01:56:32.021]  That's banned on the Super Bowl.
[01:56:33.641 --> 01:56:34.422]  Well, exactly.
[01:56:34.962 --> 01:56:36.042]  I don't get their thinking.
[01:56:36.262 --> 01:56:37.662]  I really don't get their thinking.
[01:56:38.303 --> 01:56:38.943]  I hear you, brother.
[01:56:38.963 --> 01:56:44.424]  I'm talking about the young man that, you know, shoot his pop-tart in the shape of a gun.
[01:56:45.564 --> 01:56:46.965]  Well, that's in 1984.
[01:56:47.005 --> 01:56:48.445]  You can be disappeared for even less.
[01:56:49.656 --> 01:56:51.478]  I mean, so let him get suspended.
[01:56:51.518 --> 01:56:53.240]  The Pop-Tart looked like a gun to somebody else.
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:56.864]  If you see a cloud looks like a gun, it's over your neighbor's house, arrest them.
[01:56:57.324 --> 01:56:58.245]  I think that's reasonable.
[01:56:58.565 --> 01:57:02.990]  If you are born with a mole in the shape of a submachine gun, you'll never see the light of day.
[01:57:03.010 --> 01:57:05.373]  Yeah, they just take a meat cleaver out, chop the baby up.
[01:57:05.713 --> 01:57:06.073]  Absolutely.
[01:57:06.173 --> 01:57:08.015]  Alright, appreciate your call, brother.
[01:57:08.035 --> 01:57:08.616]  Good to hear from you.
[01:57:08.636 --> 01:57:12.200]  Todd in Canada, here on the air with Stephan Molyneux, our guest.
[01:57:13.072 --> 01:57:14.154]  Gentlemen, how are you doing today?
[01:57:14.194 --> 01:57:15.195]  I just want to touch base.
[01:57:15.235 --> 01:57:18.239]  You started off this segment about the gun ban in Canada.
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:20.342]  It's the Swiss-style classic green.
[01:57:20.763 --> 01:57:25.470]  And what it is is the RCMP have just banned it without going through the proper channels and whatnot.
[01:57:25.810 --> 01:57:29.075]  Now what I've done is I've started a YouTube channel and I've started speaking out against it.
[01:57:29.455 --> 01:57:38.703]  This morning, I called the head office for the firearms registry here in Canada, and I videotaped the encounter, and I put it on YouTube.
[01:57:39.023 --> 01:57:43.027]  And I told them I was very nice to her, you know, I asked my questions, which she couldn't answer any of them.
[01:57:43.527 --> 01:57:48.992]  And I just basically said, okay, thanks very much, just so you know, I'm going to put this on YouTube, and have a nice day.
[01:57:49.332 --> 01:57:50.994]  My phone rang 20 minutes later.
[01:57:51.334 --> 01:57:51.975]  We're good to go.
[01:58:09.758 --> 01:58:10.298]  Absolutely.
[01:58:10.418 --> 01:58:16.182]  I've been following this in Canada, where they're lawlessly just reclassifying guns that they've registered and confiscating them.
[01:58:16.562 --> 01:58:18.303]  And this is happening everywhere, Stefan.
[01:58:18.323 --> 01:58:19.244]  This is really getting serious.
[01:58:19.424 --> 01:58:22.126]  Well, you know, this is the example of what we've been talking about.
[01:58:22.146 --> 01:58:23.386]  Different rules for them than for you.
[01:58:23.867 --> 01:58:26.508]  You see, they can bypass legal procedures to take your guns.
[01:58:26.728 --> 01:58:29.350]  But if you take a call without their permission, that's wrong.
[01:58:29.650 --> 01:58:31.091]  Because you don't have their permission.
[01:58:31.111 --> 01:58:34.753]  Even though if you announce it in their public servant, I know about Canadian law, same as ours, you can do it.
[01:58:35.634 --> 01:58:36.775]  Hey, I tell you what, caller.
[01:58:37.475 --> 01:58:38.496]  Plug your YouTube channel.
[01:58:38.516 --> 01:58:40.336]  I want to look at that and add it to our article if it's good.
[01:58:41.017 --> 01:58:41.657]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:58:41.677 --> 01:58:42.897]  It's Awaken Canada.
[01:58:42.957 --> 01:58:43.718]  It's a new channel.
[01:58:43.758 --> 01:58:44.458]  It's not pretty.
[01:58:44.578 --> 01:58:45.158]  I've just started.
[01:58:45.178 --> 01:58:45.618]  It's okay.
[01:58:45.659 --> 01:58:47.139]  Awaken Canada on YouTube.
[01:58:47.419 --> 01:58:48.000]  We'll look it up.
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:48.440]  Overdrop.
[01:58:52.181 --> 01:58:56.143]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.542 --> 01:59:08.550]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:59:08.630 --> 01:59:16.877]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:59:17.037 --> 01:59:21.742]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:59:21.942 --> 01:59:25.585]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:59:26.786 --> 01:59:27.386]  We're good to go.
[01:59:50.777 --> 01:59:56.902]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:59:57.062 --> 01:59:59.324]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:00:02.566 --> 02:00:04.488]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.948 --> 02:00:07.731]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:14.298 --> 02:00:14.918]  Big Brother.
[02:00:15.599 --> 02:00:16.639]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.480]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:19.141 --> 02:00:19.941]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.702 --> 02:00:21.602]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.263 --> 02:00:25.905]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.445 --> 02:00:30.528]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.085 --> 02:00:46.270]  Fellow Schlafly's coming up in the next segment to break down the facts on our opinion about the national suicide.
[02:00:46.290 --> 02:00:48.991]  It's already suicide anyways.
[02:00:49.171 --> 02:01:01.719]  If we take on another 30 million illegal aliens, give them all welfare, and then that just lets the next group come in, who then almost universally vote for the Democratic Party and all of their kleptocratic activities.
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:04.561]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:01:05.643 --> 02:01:07.905]  We are not a democracy, we are a republic.
[02:01:08.325 --> 02:01:12.869]  51% can't vote to make me a slave, but they're operating like that now.
[02:01:14.710 --> 02:01:20.155]  I saw a Time Magazine cover the other day that had the capital on it.
[02:01:21.325 --> 02:01:23.505]  When it said majority rule and was X'd out.
[02:01:23.525 --> 02:01:28.246]  And was saying the majority in a fake poll want to ban guns, but we can't do it.
[02:01:28.867 --> 02:01:32.727]  The majority want Obamacare, was an old magazine, but we can't do it.
[02:01:32.787 --> 02:01:35.828]  The majority want to have their heads chopped off, but we can't do it.
[02:01:35.848 --> 02:01:41.529]  There's a new article out at Infowars.com.
[02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:44.310]  Polls, 71% wish they'd not voted for Obama.
[02:01:45.365 --> 02:01:49.447]  Even 55% of Democrats say they regret re-electing the President.
[02:01:49.827 --> 02:01:50.888]  Too late, suckers!
[02:01:51.828 --> 02:01:54.490]  And it doesn't mean Romney would have been even better.
[02:01:54.510 --> 02:01:55.550]  The fix was in.
[02:01:55.610 --> 02:01:56.191]  That's the point.
[02:01:56.691 --> 02:01:59.692]  Matt Drudge tweets report warning about suicide of the GOP.
[02:01:59.853 --> 02:02:06.256]  And then that's got Schaffley's report re-posted in it.
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:14.601]  So be sure and get that out to everybody you know.
[02:02:15.842 --> 02:02:18.422]  Right now, let's go to another phone call.
[02:02:19.723 --> 02:02:21.904]  Andrea in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:02:21.964 --> 02:02:22.604]  Thank you for calling.
[02:02:23.704 --> 02:02:25.185]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:02:25.325 --> 02:02:26.305]  I'm doing great, talking to you.
[02:02:26.325 --> 02:02:32.647]  Hey, I'm calling about something that I heard another caller say earlier.
[02:02:33.627 --> 02:02:42.003]  I woke up this morning and I was just really thinking, you know, how for the last few months you've been feeling in your gut that there's a false flag coming up.
[02:02:42.784 --> 02:02:45.510]  And I just was thinking, I thought a really cool
[02:02:47.094 --> 02:02:51.220]  On YouTube, a geoengineering scientist has got a video out.
[02:02:51.821 --> 02:02:55.145]  And I really think that that might be what they're up to in California.
[02:02:55.786 --> 02:03:03.637]  Because it just, there's not enough evidence and they're getting smarter because too many people out there are kind of pointing out their false flags.
[02:03:04.418 --> 02:03:11.860]  And it just seems like that's something that maybe you can blow the lid off of, you know, with... Well, sure, here's the problem, and I'm not criticizing anybody.
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:16.821]  Everybody uses the layman provincial term, chemtrails, that we started hearing about in the early 90s.
[02:03:16.941 --> 02:03:26.323]  And there's a patent, and the guy won in 92, I forget the scientist's name, a UN science prize for developing, quote, sunscreen for the earth.
[02:03:26.923 --> 02:03:30.484]  Kids' textbooks teach that they're already spraying it to save us from global warming.
[02:03:31.084 --> 02:03:32.685]  But the details are all classified.
[02:03:32.745 --> 02:03:34.666]  It's added to jet fuel under four patents.
[02:03:35.106 --> 02:03:36.567]  So the pilots don't even know what's going on.
[02:03:36.607 --> 02:03:39.228]  It's aerosolized, barium salts, lemon dioxide, others.
[02:03:40.109 --> 02:03:43.831]  There's a $5 billion a year Department of Energy program.
[02:03:44.371 --> 02:03:50.514]  And they do seem to be concentrating out on the West Coast with all that moisture coming in, manipulating and stopping it.
[02:03:50.935 --> 02:03:53.956]  And they've got aircraft out there spraying, and we know what's going on.
[02:03:53.976 --> 02:03:56.738]  And they've had even people from the California Department of
[02:03:58.408 --> 02:04:04.691]  You know, go out there and go, yeah, we're getting like 20 times the aluminum, we're getting barium salts, the trees are dying.
[02:04:05.352 --> 02:04:09.174]  So, I don't know what's going on because the program's secret, but it's bad.
[02:04:09.934 --> 02:04:11.675]  And it's weather modification, you name it.
[02:04:12.695 --> 02:04:18.779]  And, I mean, the globalists will pay to ship General Motors to China, will pay to ship Jeep to Italy.
[02:04:19.779 --> 02:04:23.261]  They'll pay to shut down your local power plant.
[02:04:25.266 --> 02:04:26.987]  I mean, they are shutting America down.
[02:04:27.387 --> 02:04:29.328]  Except for select globalists who are exempt.
[02:04:30.549 --> 02:04:33.130]  And it's just a serious situation, I hear you.
[02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:35.471]  So we do need to look at the California drought.
[02:04:35.591 --> 02:04:36.832]  Is it a chemtrail operation?
[02:04:37.132 --> 02:04:39.373]  And look at the geoengineering program and admit it's going on.
[02:04:39.393 --> 02:04:41.334]  And show that it manipulates weather.
[02:04:42.594 --> 02:04:44.855]  And do a report for the Nightly News or something on that.
[02:04:44.915 --> 02:04:45.395]  I agree with you.
[02:04:45.416 --> 02:04:45.996]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:47.386 --> 02:04:57.648]  Alright, Phyllis Schlafly is going to be with us for about 40 minutes on the other side and we'll have about 10 minutes or so of news reports and calls if you still are able to stay with us.
[02:04:58.589 --> 02:05:02.150]  But all this and more is coming up straight ahead.
[02:05:02.170 --> 02:05:06.931]  Deneen, Nico, Andrew, Steve, we'll get to all of you as well.
[02:05:06.951 --> 02:05:07.751]  But Phyllis Schlafly...
[02:05:09.448 --> 02:05:19.792]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:05:20.112 --> 02:05:21.973]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:05:22.173 --> 02:05:22.874]  Fluoride!
[02:05:23.054 --> 02:05:24.634]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:05:24.994 --> 02:05:31.277]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:05:31.537 --> 02:05:36.363]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:05:36.483 --> 02:05:42.570]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:05:42.791 --> 02:05:44.973]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:05:45.233 --> 02:05:47.857]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:05:48.157 --> 02:05:51.521]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:05:51.641 --> 02:05:56.227]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:57.088 --> 02:06:01.894]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[02:06:02.194 --> 02:06:03.236]  I take it every day.
[02:06:03.376 --> 02:06:06.239]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3147.
[02:06:09.423 --> 02:06:12.165]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:06:12.445 --> 02:06:17.289]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:06:17.469 --> 02:06:24.635]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[02:08:19.514 --> 02:08:23.405]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:23.525 --> 02:08:25.410]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.795 --> 02:08:37.177]  Well, joining us for the next 35-40 minutes or so is Phyllis Shafley, who really needs no introduction.
[02:08:37.197 --> 02:08:41.238]  She's been on the broadcast the last 18 years, probably six or seven times.
[02:08:41.959 --> 02:08:49.161]  We appreciate her coming back on today with one of the most serious issues for this republic, and quite frankly, the future of the world itself.
[02:08:50.758 --> 02:09:00.327]  And she, of course, is a best-selling author and she became the leader of the conservative movement with the publication of her best-selling book in 64, A Choice, Not an Echo.
[02:09:01.128 --> 02:09:04.951]  And I'm not going to go over all the things she's done in her 47 years.
[02:09:04.971 --> 02:09:06.312]  This is an old bio battle.
[02:09:06.352 --> 02:09:07.333]  It's more than that now.
[02:09:08.434 --> 02:09:13.178]  And she has testified before more than 50 congressional and state legislative committees.
[02:09:14.459 --> 02:09:24.422]  She was appointed by President Reagan, a member of the Bicentennial Commission, and she promotes all things Americana.
[02:09:25.122 --> 02:09:37.765]  And they've gone out and indexed the poll numbers and showed what I and many of you already knew, but it's good to document it, that the vast majority, between 75 and 90 percent, depending on the poll, of illegals
[02:09:39.062 --> 02:09:44.186]  And even immigrants, period, tend to vote Democratic, anti-gun, anti-family, you name it.
[02:09:45.346 --> 02:09:48.809]  And even though it's not in their interest, they want to be pliant.
[02:09:49.758 --> 02:09:51.119]  And they just vote straight ticket.
[02:09:51.819 --> 02:09:54.201]  And I've got big criticisms of the Republican leadership.
[02:09:54.241 --> 02:10:01.626]  They've been supporting this amnesty with the Republican big donors, because they're part of this globalist agenda.
[02:10:01.646 --> 02:10:04.968]  But all over the world, they've gotten rid of borders, partially.
[02:10:05.028 --> 02:10:06.889]  And they've just... Europe's going bankrupt.
[02:10:07.249 --> 02:10:10.551]  They use the immigrant populations to become the new bureaucratic enforcement arm.
[02:10:11.472 --> 02:10:18.717]  I've had members of the EU Parliament on, members of the UK Parliament, even Liberal members on, talking about this situation.
[02:10:19.597 --> 02:10:31.444]  And if you can get a group to come in who can then vote to get welfare in exchange for voting for parties that will take guns, that will take liberty and take sovereignty, you have been conquered.
[02:10:32.565 --> 02:10:34.426]  You have been conquered demographically.
[02:10:35.266 --> 02:10:47.233]  I'll be honest, if we had 30 million illegals here and they were green-skinned, not predominantly light brown-skinned from Latin America, and they were voting for the Second Amendment, national sovereignty, freedom, war on welfare,
[02:10:48.493 --> 02:10:51.296]  It's a lot of people, but we've aborted 50-plus million Americans.
[02:10:51.316 --> 02:10:51.856]  Maybe we need them.
[02:10:53.158 --> 02:10:53.838]  Since Roe v. Wade.
[02:10:54.159 --> 02:10:56.441]  The problem is, the ideology is pure poison.
[02:10:57.041 --> 02:10:59.644]  And if you haven't traveled Latin America, I suggest you go travel it.
[02:10:59.704 --> 02:11:00.365]  It's a nightmare.
[02:11:01.366 --> 02:11:02.887]  I'd love to export freedom down there.
[02:11:02.927 --> 02:11:06.310]  Instead, we're exporting the poverty, the crime up here.
[02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:07.391]  And Mexico's a failed state.
[02:11:07.692 --> 02:11:10.555]  And this idea that we are somehow hateful and criminal
[02:11:11.624 --> 02:11:13.605]  We already have the most open policies in the world.
[02:11:13.725 --> 02:11:28.815]  If we don't just throw our doors open and say, have your babies here free, all the welfare, and we won't wear American flags at school, we'll take down American flags, we won't dress as cowboys or natives at college parties on Halloween.
[02:11:29.776 --> 02:11:30.356]  It's a joke.
[02:11:30.896 --> 02:11:32.737]  Oh, you criticize Obama, it's because you're racist.
[02:11:32.777 --> 02:11:34.097]  No, it's because Obamacare is a scam.
[02:11:34.477 --> 02:11:37.258]  So I want to give Phyllis Schlafly the floor here.
[02:11:37.278 --> 02:11:38.118]  I've said my piece.
[02:11:38.798 --> 02:11:46.619]  To break down her tip of the spear coverage that's been on DrugsReport.com from the Phyllis Schlafly Report at EagleForum.org.
[02:11:46.699 --> 02:11:49.380]  You can also go to PhyllisSchlafly.com.
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:53.641]  And she joins us right now to break this down because
[02:11:54.381 --> 02:12:11.724]  Obama is already, I want to cover what's going to happen if they do this, but then Obama's already legalizing most of the illegals by fiat, so the Republican leadership, A, is being beaten on getting amnesty, because it is suicide for the country, but B, they have to be beaten on letting Obama act as an executive dictator.
[02:12:11.984 --> 02:12:15.184]  Doesn't mean he's a dictator fully, the office is becoming dictatorial.
[02:12:15.545 --> 02:12:18.985]  So, Mrs. Phyllis Schlafly, thank you so much for coming on.
[02:12:19.025 --> 02:12:19.885]  You've got the floor.
[02:12:20.205 --> 02:12:23.846]  Give us this report, worldwide, that people are tuning in to hear right now.
[02:12:24.326 --> 02:12:28.893]  Well, hi Alex, I'm happy to join you, and you laid it out very well.
[02:12:29.814 --> 02:12:34.861]  These people who want to bring in millions of people, they're going to vote Democratic.
[02:12:35.482 --> 02:12:40.309]  And we know this, not because it's my opinion or because I've talked to them.
[02:12:40.769 --> 02:12:46.052]  It's because all of these recognized pollsters have reached a consensus on this.
[02:12:46.612 --> 02:12:48.493]  And there's no dispute in it.
[02:12:49.173 --> 02:13:02.240]  These pollsters all say that the ones coming in, the big majority of them, are people who believe in big government, offering more services than limited government, balanced budgets, and that sort of thing.
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:09.464]  And you know the conservative movement and the Republican Party are built on restraint in government, limited government.
[02:13:09.984 --> 02:13:16.226]  And the millions of new people we're bringing in are not that at all.
[02:13:16.246 --> 02:13:17.646]  They have no experience with it.
[02:13:17.666 --> 02:13:18.846]  They don't think they like it.
[02:13:18.866 --> 02:13:23.887]  They're glad to come here and accept the welfare goodies that our government hands out.
[02:13:26.128 --> 02:13:32.429]  And you've got seven plus billion people that would like to come here, and under globalism there's no sovereignty, no borders.
[02:13:32.869 --> 02:13:35.050]  That sounds like they want to make us the new Calcutta.
[02:13:36.058 --> 02:13:41.966]  Well, I think it was Ronald Reagan who said a country without borders is not a country.
[02:13:42.366 --> 02:13:46.692]  You've got to have borders, and we expect people to respect them.
[02:13:47.253 --> 02:13:50.698]  And if people want to come to this country, they ought to obey our laws.
[02:13:51.598 --> 02:14:02.786]  And these pollsters, for example, they've taken a poll on whether you want the children in the public schools to be taught that America is a great country.
[02:14:03.266 --> 02:14:06.048]  And of course, the big majority of Americans think that.
[02:14:07.088 --> 02:14:13.853]  But the recent immigrants, even if they're naturalized, not even the majority believe that.
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:18.142]  And they ask him, well, are you for Obamacare?
[02:14:18.202 --> 02:14:21.124]  Well, yes, they are a majority for Obamacare.
[02:14:22.045 --> 02:14:24.026]  And it's no wonder.
[02:14:24.086 --> 02:14:27.248]  Why is anybody surprised that they vote for the Democrats?
[02:14:27.428 --> 02:14:28.429]  That's the way it is.
[02:14:31.232 --> 02:14:40.058]  I know a lot of Democrats, and finally some of them are waking up, that Obamacare was a premeditated fraud and a scam to select interest, a literal looting.
[02:14:40.898 --> 02:14:46.482]  But so many Democrats just say, I don't care, we're going to wreck the whole system and then I'm going to get something free.
[02:14:47.142 --> 02:14:52.647]  I mean, they don't even care if they're getting screwed over as long as they feel like they're part of some winning team.
[02:14:52.987 --> 02:14:53.928]  I mean, I've got to say it.
[02:14:54.408 --> 02:14:57.271]  Democrats on MSNBC love talking about how smart they are all day.
[02:14:57.291 --> 02:15:03.777]  I don't know if you've seen Mark Dice's videos where he goes out and talks to Democrats in California and they say the most authoritarian things.
[02:15:04.217 --> 02:15:06.479]  They don't know that the Earth orbits the Sun.
[02:15:06.959 --> 02:15:10.963]  The average Democrat has got to be the stupidest person on the planet.
[02:15:12.876 --> 02:15:17.298]  Well, maybe they think they're smart because they've learned how to get free money.
[02:15:19.119 --> 02:15:24.162]  These polls are really very, very revealing.
[02:15:26.243 --> 02:15:31.686]  These people who are coming in are people who have no experience with our type of government.
[02:15:31.726 --> 02:15:35.208]  You've heard people say that we are an exceptional country.
[02:15:36.108 --> 02:15:37.789]  That word isn't even strong enough.
[02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:39.430]  America is unique.
[02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:44.294]  There's no other country that is built on the idea of limited government.
[02:15:44.635 --> 02:15:49.139]  As Thomas Jefferson said, bind them down from mischief with the chains of the Constitution.
[02:15:49.699 --> 02:15:54.043]  And we think they ought to keep their spending down and keep taxes low and so forth.
[02:15:54.484 --> 02:15:57.246]  And other countries don't even understand that.
[02:15:57.967 --> 02:16:04.313]  They depend on the government for practically to walk across the street, whether they can or not.
[02:16:05.053 --> 02:16:10.697]  And they don't know what we're talking about when we say we want a smaller government doing less.
[02:16:11.838 --> 02:16:22.005]  And so if you bring in the people who want the government running things, who want the government doing handouts, you're going to get more Democratic votes.
[02:16:22.065 --> 02:16:22.966]  Why are you surprised?
[02:16:24.189 --> 02:16:36.776]  Well, you're certainly right, and America was hyper-unique, hyper-exceptional by every metric of inventions, trailblazing, military activity, just on every front, literature, art.
[02:16:37.256 --> 02:16:51.984]  We have been the flower of the Renaissance in the last 230 plus years, and now we see all the prosperity going out the window as we follow the globalist, collectivist program that always creates rack and ruin.
[02:16:53.444 --> 02:17:05.746]  Well, all of these trade agreements, which are presented in the name of globalism and getting along in the world and free trade and all those slogans, they create jobs and investment in other countries.
[02:17:06.626 --> 02:17:08.027]  They don't create them in this country.
[02:17:08.547 --> 02:17:10.507]  We lose jobs.
[02:17:10.747 --> 02:17:13.327]  And it's a real betrayal.
[02:17:13.368 --> 02:17:18.048]  This is why the middle class has been shrinking every year under the Obama administration.
[02:17:22.683 --> 02:17:27.666]  It's just, this new report that I have out, it's a 40-page report.
[02:17:27.686 --> 02:17:31.549]  It's available on my website, eagleforum.org.
[02:17:32.330 --> 02:17:44.438]  And just to give you another example, one poll found that 81% of native-born Americans believe our schools should teach that students should be proud to be American.
[02:17:45.218 --> 02:17:50.362]  But only 50%, only half of the immigrants, even after they're naturalized, believe that.
[02:17:51.182 --> 02:17:59.766]  And you know, these amnesty advocates like to compare our current immigration with what we were bringing in around 1920.
[02:18:01.467 --> 02:18:08.051]  And the people who came in from Western Europe in 1920 all wanted to be real Americans.
[02:18:08.111 --> 02:18:14.874]  I have any number of friends who told me when they came as a teenager and landed at Ellis Island in New York,
[02:18:15.635 --> 02:18:21.300]  Their mother or father would say, now we're in America, and we're going to be Americans, and we're going to speak English.
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:23.201]  And this is our country now.
[02:18:24.382 --> 02:18:26.644]  And that's not the way they feel about it today.
[02:18:27.525 --> 02:18:33.149]  The ones who are coming in seem to maintain their allegiance to their own country.
[02:18:33.650 --> 02:18:41.796]  And when you take the oath of citizenship, you're supposed to renounce all allegiance to any king, potentate, foreign government of any kind.
[02:18:42.256 --> 02:18:43.898]  And I don't know whether they recite all that,
[02:18:44.406 --> 02:19:03.995]  But it's obvious they don't believe it because the polls all show that they're not proud to be an American and they really don't believe in the type of government, of limited government, that made our country the most prosperous and the freest country on the face of the earth.
[02:19:04.585 --> 02:19:09.989]  That's right, you can't argue with the cold, hard, scientific, sociological, geopolitical facts.
[02:19:11.409 --> 02:19:18.274]  I want to go to break here and come back and get into some more of the poll numbers that are on the site for everybody that wants to go check them out.
[02:19:18.354 --> 02:19:21.756]  EagleForum.org, absolutely essential.
[02:19:21.796 --> 02:19:24.958]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest right now.
[02:19:25.519 --> 02:19:28.500]  And when we come back, I'm going to let her continue to get into the battle.
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:30.102]  What's happening currently on Capitol Hill?
[02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:32.303]  A tireless fighter.
[02:19:32.323 --> 02:19:39.089]  I guess in more than 60 years she's been battling an 89 years old and joining us today as sharp as ever.
[02:19:39.109 --> 02:19:40.350]  She's the same age as my grandmother.
[02:19:41.491 --> 02:19:43.332]  And is battling the tyrants here today.
[02:19:43.352 --> 02:19:45.714]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna say it again.
[02:19:45.914 --> 02:19:48.036]  Nobody's got open borders like we do.
[02:19:48.536 --> 02:19:51.219]  Nobody brings in foreigners and throws them right on welfare.
[02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:53.000]  Nobody.
[02:19:54.381 --> 02:19:54.762]  Nobody.
[02:19:57.324 --> 02:19:58.625]  It is simply insane.
[02:19:59.684 --> 02:20:01.146]  That is simply insane.
[02:20:01.947 --> 02:20:06.233]  Our hospitality has been used by the globalists to bring in a foreign force of politicos.
[02:20:06.253 --> 02:20:06.833]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:06.853 --> 02:20:07.835]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:09.841 --> 02:20:13.483]  Clean water at home, clean water at the office, clean water on the go.
[02:20:13.743 --> 02:20:19.667]  The Berkey Guy has a Berkey water filtration model for anywhere you are and one that fits any budget.
[02:20:20.007 --> 02:20:22.809]  Thousands of satisfied customers can't be wrong.

[02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:42.121]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:20:42.241 --> 02:20:46.243]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:20:46.543 --> 02:20:47.783]  SilverLungs.com.
[02:20:47.963 --> 02:20:50.424]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:20:50.625 --> 02:20:53.426]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.

[02:20:55.967 --> 02:20:57.727]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:20:57.867 --> 02:21:03.210]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.

[02:21:14.853 --> 02:21:16.675]  So, Dad, you're sounding a lot better.
[02:21:17.035 --> 02:21:18.856]  How have you been feeling since your heart attack?
[02:21:19.076 --> 02:21:21.298]  Well, son, I am feeling a lot better.
[02:21:21.578 --> 02:21:25.902]  Ever since your sister ordered me a bottle of HeartDrop 2000's Xtendivite from my heart.
[02:21:26.382 --> 02:21:26.943]  HeartDrop?
[02:21:27.083 --> 02:21:27.703]  Xtendivite?
[02:21:27.963 --> 02:21:28.404]  What's that?
[02:21:28.844 --> 02:21:33.508]  Well, it's just seven herbs that are approved for helping keep my heart healthy.
[02:21:33.788 --> 02:21:34.589]  That's great, Dad.
[02:21:34.949 --> 02:21:35.990]  I was getting worried about you.
[02:21:36.410 --> 02:21:37.411]  I am so glad it's helping.
[02:21:37.851 --> 02:21:38.552]  So am I, son.
[02:21:39.092 --> 02:21:41.054]  I'm very glad your sister got it for me.
[02:21:41.614 --> 02:21:43.676]  I wish I had known about it before my heart attack.
[02:21:44.016 --> 02:21:45.617]  Yeah, but would you have taken it, though?
[02:21:46.357 --> 02:21:47.858]  You know, I'm not sure if I would have.
[02:21:48.498 --> 02:21:50.339]  But I'm awful glad I'm taking it now.
[02:21:51.059 --> 02:21:52.000]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:52.600]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:54.321]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[02:22:09.209 --> 02:22:09.609]  Hi there.
[02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:11.290]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:22:11.751 --> 02:22:14.973]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:22:15.573 --> 02:22:24.359]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:22:24.719 --> 02:22:30.743]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:22:31.424 --> 02:22:33.005]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:22:33.625 --> 02:22:38.709]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:46.512]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:22:47.352 --> 02:22:52.274]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:22:52.955 --> 02:22:58.837]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:22:59.437 --> 02:23:04.780]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:06.320]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:23:08.121 --> 02:23:11.442]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:23:11.542 --> 02:23:13.763]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:23:13.943 --> 02:23:22.186]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:23:22.486 --> 02:23:35.250]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:23:35.470 --> 02:23:46.280]  And then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:52.725]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:23:52.985 --> 02:24:01.553]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[02:24:21.546 --> 02:24:22.807]  Alex Jones here back live.
[02:24:22.827 --> 02:24:25.788]  Phyllis Shafley, by the way, is a constitutional lawyer.
[02:24:25.808 --> 02:24:30.110]  And of course, a mother who had, I think it was six children.
[02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:32.311]  And she's had a whole bunch of best-selling books.
[02:24:32.331 --> 02:24:38.713]  We're going to talk about her newest best-seller, where Obama is waging war on the First Amendment, not just the others.
[02:24:38.753 --> 02:24:40.534]  Religious freedom is within the First Amendment.
[02:24:40.954 --> 02:24:42.495]  We're going to talk to her about that in the next segment.
[02:24:42.515 --> 02:24:50.622]  In the short one though, Phyllis, please, because you're pausing and letting me jump in, I want you to roll here because you've got all the deep data and the research.
[02:24:51.163 --> 02:24:55.046]  Break down what it means if they get this next crop of illegals legalized.
[02:24:55.486 --> 02:25:06.536]  Obviously in the next group, the next, we're in total checkmate politically because these folks are voting in a collectivist manner and I've tried to reach out.
[02:25:07.216 --> 02:25:10.679]  The quote immigrant population was some success, but we just can't reach enough of them.
[02:25:11.660 --> 02:25:13.121]  A, is there any way to turn this around?
[02:25:13.201 --> 02:25:14.162]  B, how do we beat it?
[02:25:14.182 --> 02:25:15.463]  And what's going on in Washington?
[02:25:15.723 --> 02:25:21.888]  Thank goodness for talk radio, because the mainstream media is concealing the whole thing.
[02:25:22.408 --> 02:25:30.135]  And there are two powerful lobbying groups that are pushing for more illegal and legal immigration.
[02:25:30.775 --> 02:25:36.640]  And they are the big business crowd who want to keep labor, and then of course the Democrats who want the votes.
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:45.203]  And my report, which is now available on EagleForum.org, it's 40 pages, there's a lot of statistical stuff.
[02:25:45.883 --> 02:25:54.946]  If you want the abbreviated Every Man's Version, you can ask for my Phyllis Schlafly report called Does the Republican Party Have a Future?
[02:25:55.366 --> 02:26:02.188]  But in any event, what these polls consistently show is that three-fourths of Hispanics coming
[02:26:02.928 --> 02:26:05.991]  Want a bigger government providing more services.
[02:26:06.091 --> 02:26:16.060]  I'm talking about services like healthcare, Obamacare, and only a tiny percentage even understand or want a smaller government.
[02:26:16.613 --> 02:26:41.407]  And you know that if we want to leave a country of freedom and prosperity to our children and grandchildren, we've got to cut down the size of government, stop these executive actions that Obama is taking on his own, which he is doing unilaterally and says he can do whatever he wants with his pen, and we have to realize that these people coming in
[02:26:42.442 --> 02:26:50.650]  The overwhelming majority of them want the government providing big services, which is of course very costly in every way.
[02:26:53.826 --> 02:26:59.831]  Expanding on that, look at what a monumental fraud and a deception Obamacare is.
[02:27:00.531 --> 02:27:06.976]  Everything that's being pushed is really bad for the overall population, bad for common sense, bad for fairness.
[02:27:07.817 --> 02:27:13.321]  But still, people that are part of the Democratic Party cult just don't care.
[02:27:13.421 --> 02:27:15.122]  They just think they've won.
[02:27:15.142 --> 02:27:20.987]  And then you've got the people like Boehner and others that are bought off by the same interest.
[02:27:21.027 --> 02:27:22.088]  I mean, what do we do about this?
[02:27:24.318 --> 02:27:25.059]  Overwhelming.
[02:27:25.119 --> 02:27:34.564]  For example, the Congressional Budget Office, which certainly is not a right-wing source, said that Obamacare is going to cost us over 2 million jobs.
[02:27:35.769 --> 02:27:42.353]  And mostly by companies reducing the number of hours that their employees can work.
[02:27:42.993 --> 02:27:50.098]  And the Obama administration tried to put a happy face on this by saying, oh that's great, people will have more free time.
[02:27:50.458 --> 02:27:54.580]  They'll be able to do more fun things that they want to do when they're not working.
[02:27:55.401 --> 02:27:56.962]  Well that's not the way you get ahead.
[02:27:56.982 --> 02:27:58.963]  That's not the way you support your family.
[02:28:00.098 --> 02:28:09.108]  Well, we believe in work, in full-time work, and we hope guys will have a good job full-time that's going to be able to support his family.
[02:28:09.168 --> 02:28:10.889]  But that isn't what Obama wants.
[02:28:11.570 --> 02:28:20.360]  He wants to cut the amount of work people are doing so they're working less hours, getting less money, and then they have their insurance paid for by the taxpayers.
[02:28:21.897 --> 02:28:30.039]  It's all so rotten, Alex, and the high-handed dictatorial way that Obama's doing it, it's amazing.
[02:28:30.479 --> 02:28:36.361]  But these polls are very compelling in showing what the people think about this.
[02:28:36.901 --> 02:28:41.743]  And they're not voting for amnesty, they're voting for handouts by the government.
[02:28:42.323 --> 02:28:44.083]  And they get that by voting Democratic.
[02:28:44.803 --> 02:28:49.525]  And then they'll support, literally, making those of us that produce
[02:28:50.475 --> 02:29:04.264]  They're slaves and then George Soros and Warren Buffett, big constituents of the Democrats and big recipients of corporate welfare, and then they write the laws to be exempt from the taxes.
[02:29:05.025 --> 02:29:07.026]  They're lobbying to raise taxes on the middle class.
[02:29:07.466 --> 02:29:12.309]  This takes us back to a democracy where two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[02:29:14.351 --> 02:29:14.731]  Yeah.
[02:29:15.651 --> 02:29:19.434]  Yeah, that'd be a joke if it weren't so really tragic.
[02:29:20.823 --> 02:29:36.932]  The way they are manipulating the people and making them think that the government is the source of goodness and money and the number of people who are now on food stamps, the number of people who get housing supplements.
[02:29:37.512 --> 02:29:46.015]  The EITC, the Earned Income Tax Credit, it just gives you a bigger tax-free refund than you were entitled to otherwise.
[02:29:46.035 --> 02:29:47.316]  Fellas, I've got to interrupt you.
[02:29:47.336 --> 02:29:47.936]  Stay right there.
[02:29:48.016 --> 02:29:48.836]  One more segment with you.
[02:29:48.876 --> 02:29:51.457]  Fellow Schlafly, EagleForum.org to read all the reports.
[02:29:52.177 --> 02:29:53.418]  We're going to come right back to you.
[02:29:53.438 --> 02:29:54.598]  I want to finish up with those numbers.
[02:29:54.898 --> 02:29:58.359]  Then I want to get into the overall Unitary Executive, what your new book's about.
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:29:59.740]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:01.841]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.761 --> 02:30:05.442]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:14.146]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:30:14.307 --> 02:30:17.271]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:30:17.431 --> 02:30:22.658]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:30:22.979 --> 02:30:24.581]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:30:24.901 --> 02:30:26.242]  We are what we eat.
[02:30:26.542 --> 02:30:30.883]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:30:31.204 --> 02:30:35.185]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:30:35.425 --> 02:30:37.746]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:30:37.986 --> 02:30:43.929]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:31:12.336 --> 02:31:17.218]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:31:17.478 --> 02:31:25.342]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:31:25.602 --> 02:31:29.903]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:31:30.123 --> 02:31:33.945]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:31:34.085 --> 02:31:39.789]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:31:40.029 --> 02:31:42.811]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:31:43.211 --> 02:31:48.415]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[02:32:09.149 --> 02:32:12.491]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:32:12.571 --> 02:32:14.833]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:32:14.993 --> 02:32:20.176]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[02:32:20.316 --> 02:32:23.278]  There are other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:32:23.578 --> 02:32:33.803]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.

[02:33:20.567 --> 02:33:29.253]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.593 --> 02:33:31.334]  Oh, they doled up Obamacare.
[02:33:31.374 --> 02:33:36.937]  They said there weren't any death panels, it didn't ration care, didn't kick pre-existing condition folks off.
[02:33:37.418 --> 02:33:39.319]  You could keep your doctor firm pledge.
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:43.501]  It would lower your premium to the cost of a phone bill or cable bill.
[02:33:43.521 --> 02:33:45.823]  I don't know, maybe for a whole hotel.
[02:33:47.558 --> 02:33:51.061]  And mine has doubled since it went in six months ago.
[02:33:51.081 --> 02:33:52.902]  Rolando Rivera was on the show a few months ago.
[02:33:53.323 --> 02:33:57.666]  His has tripled, and for that of all of his six employees, tripled.
[02:33:59.568 --> 02:34:01.529]  And my dad's has more than doubled.
[02:34:02.570 --> 02:34:05.232]  And everyone I know, it's at least doubled.
[02:34:06.173 --> 02:34:12.138]  Because some, some it's only gone up 45, 50, 60 percent, but most people it's more than doubled.
[02:34:12.158 --> 02:34:14.680]  So if you average it, it's about a doubling, to be technical.
[02:34:15.851 --> 02:34:17.172]  And that's just year one.
[02:34:17.252 --> 02:34:18.552]  I mean, this is just going to get better and better.
[02:34:18.812 --> 02:34:24.015]  And the reason I raise that is, they said, hey, if you don't like Obamacare, you're racist.
[02:34:24.995 --> 02:34:26.276]  On MSNBC and CNN.
[02:34:26.696 --> 02:34:28.957]  And there are no death panels, and none of this is true.
[02:34:29.317 --> 02:34:30.537]  We had the bill.
[02:34:31.718 --> 02:34:36.040]  And now Obama acts as a dictator, implementing what he wants, where he wants.
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:38.741]  Oh, unions, you're exempt, but not families.
[02:34:39.081 --> 02:34:41.142]  That's the ultimate form of discrimination.
[02:34:42.503 --> 02:34:45.145]  While they're talking about discrimination, we don't like it because he's black.
[02:34:45.585 --> 02:34:49.649]  Let me tell you, I'd vote for a black man in about half a second if he was like Ron Paul.
[02:34:50.990 --> 02:34:52.171]  I could care less.
[02:34:52.251 --> 02:34:52.931]  I'd love it.
[02:34:53.792 --> 02:34:55.634]  It'd be even better, because then they couldn't attack him as much.
[02:34:55.674 --> 02:34:56.654]  But they would, though.
[02:34:56.734 --> 02:34:59.377]  It wouldn't work if they were libertarian or conservative.
[02:35:00.337 --> 02:35:07.843]  It is so disgusting what Obama said two weeks ago in a Time Magazine interview, and it was someone in the New Yorker, similar things.
[02:35:08.244 --> 02:35:10.385]  Well, my poll numbers are down because of racism.
[02:35:10.545 --> 02:35:10.786]  What?
[02:35:12.153 --> 02:35:12.353]  What?
[02:35:28.897 --> 02:35:32.500]  But then we go to the next problem, as you know, you're best selling books out about it.
[02:35:33.061 --> 02:35:39.727]  Doesn't matter, Obama is just legalizing a bunch of the illegals, ordering the courts to let people go, and the amnesty courts.
[02:35:40.107 --> 02:35:49.316]  He's just doing it by executive fiat to begin with, so where's the Republican leadership beginning impeachment of the president turning the office into a dictatorship?
[02:35:50.759 --> 02:35:57.843]  Well I hope you saw him on your television screen when he said he has a plan and he can do whatever he wants to do.
[02:35:57.863 --> 02:35:58.744]  And a telephone.
[02:35:59.965 --> 02:36:00.505]  And it is.
[02:36:01.245 --> 02:36:03.146]  And it was so arrogant.
[02:36:03.427 --> 02:36:05.628]  It was so condescending to Americans.
[02:36:06.008 --> 02:36:08.830]  It was embarrassing if we think we're a self-governing people.
[02:36:09.470 --> 02:36:15.054]  And he has changed his own law, Obamacare, I think personally, unilaterally, about 30 times.
[02:36:16.514 --> 02:36:22.981]  And he just wants to do whatever he wants to get the Democrats re-elected.
[02:36:23.021 --> 02:36:29.028]  And I think the only way we can save our country is to elect a majority of conservatives to the U.S.
[02:36:29.768 --> 02:36:34.874]  Senate in November and get the right guys nominated in the primary.
[02:36:35.712 --> 02:36:46.569]  And it is so important because, for example, if Obama gets another appointment to the Supreme Court, he will rule the country with his nutty ideas for the next 50 years.
[02:36:48.286 --> 02:36:49.527]  And we cannot afford that.
[02:36:49.687 --> 02:37:06.735]  We need to have enough senators to stand up and say we're not going to give you many more judges because some of these, I call them supremacist judges, are as bad as Obama in trying to remake the law and dictate to the American people.
[02:37:07.815 --> 02:37:15.539]  You've been fighting this tyranny for 60 plus years as a constitutional lawyer, but I've studied political elites, I've studied history.
[02:37:16.934 --> 02:37:21.077]  Even if you were a corrupt elite, America and prosperity is incredibly profitable.
[02:37:21.598 --> 02:37:29.244]  You would rather skim off the top of that big large yes than destroy it and debase it all so you can run it.
[02:37:29.684 --> 02:37:39.952]  But tyrants always debilitate everything because they hate individual freedom and they jealously want to shut it down, thus destroying the engine of their own success.
[02:37:40.432 --> 02:37:43.435]  But I want to warn the political elite, including the Democrats.
[02:37:44.338 --> 02:37:46.520]  You are literally burning down your own house.
[02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:58.052]  You guys run the country now, and you have such a long-term hatred of men, and of families, and of women, and of prosperity, and of just uprightness.
[02:37:58.692 --> 02:38:04.698]  I mean, I've really studied these people, and now I've come around to the understanding that they really do want to screw stuff up.
[02:38:05.399 --> 02:38:08.221]  They really are, like Michael Savage said, I think mentally ill.
[02:38:09.021 --> 02:38:13.064]  If you disagree with that, tell me, fellas, but, I mean, you've been fighting these people for a long time.
[02:38:13.684 --> 02:38:15.005]  What is wrong with them?
[02:38:16.365 --> 02:38:22.089]  Well, they want power, and they think the way they will get power is to make the America...
[02:38:22.546 --> 02:38:28.013]  American workforce is in competition with the people in the rest of the world.
[02:38:28.033 --> 02:38:34.300]  You know a lot of our products are starting to come from Vietnam, where they work for 28 cents an hour.
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:38.585]  And I do not think Americans should have to be in competition with people like that.
[02:38:38.946 --> 02:38:40.828]  We have clearly a better system.
[02:38:41.168 --> 02:38:42.189]  A unique system.
[02:38:42.689 --> 02:38:43.870]  A prosperous system.
[02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:45.171]  A successful system.
[02:38:45.431 --> 02:38:47.153]  That's why everybody wants to come here.
[02:38:47.853 --> 02:38:53.597]  And we should let in only people who like our country, obey our laws.
[02:38:53.637 --> 02:38:54.478]  Like Switzerland?
[02:38:54.498 --> 02:38:59.281]  I mean, you could have $10 million they won't let you in unless you have a skill you're bringing.
[02:39:00.062 --> 02:39:04.625]  Switzerland, their money only goes up in value, their crime only goes down.
[02:39:04.926 --> 02:39:06.487]  They get better and better and better.
[02:39:06.567 --> 02:39:08.068]  Why don't we do what Switzerland did?
[02:39:08.268 --> 02:39:11.589]  That's right, and they just voted down this increased immigration.
[02:39:12.610 --> 02:39:17.071]  And that's why they've been able to keep a free and prosperous country.
[02:39:17.272 --> 02:39:18.572]  And we should do the same.
[02:39:19.052 --> 02:39:31.157]  But the trouble is, the media is so, so much in favor of Obama, no matter what he does, they try to ruin anybody who criticizes him.
[02:39:31.517 --> 02:39:33.898]  But Americans have got to speak up.
[02:39:34.358 --> 02:39:35.559]  We have a great country.
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:43.264]  Not let anybody in except somebody who wants to honor our country, our flag, our constitution.
[02:39:43.884 --> 02:39:53.269]  And we don't, and you know the polls are showing, Alex, that the majority of these people coming in think international law should top our constitution.
[02:39:53.650 --> 02:39:54.670]  You gotta be kidding!
[02:39:55.551 --> 02:40:01.034]  We're not, you and I are not going to let international law trump our constitution.
[02:40:02.363 --> 02:40:15.874]  That's right, and you have all the polls listed there from the Pew Research, you name it, there's a whole... Yes, all the ones that everybody else quotes, only they don't seem to quote the part about what they believe on amnesty.
[02:40:16.214 --> 02:40:26.143]  But all the polls are consistent in saying that the overwhelming majority of people coming in want bigger government handing out more services.
[02:40:26.583 --> 02:40:28.505]  It's basically like a beautiful ship
[02:40:29.707 --> 02:40:47.498]  That's not perfect, but it's the best out there, and you've always envied it, and you finally got on board, and then the Democrats hand you dynamite to put in the bottom of the ship to sink it, and then you dynamite the ship, and you're sinking, and you're like, I won, I brought down America, instead of just joining with America.
[02:40:47.538 --> 02:40:51.600]  There is a real hatred of this country, and I'm sick of it.
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:53.141]  Yes, there is.
[02:40:53.201 --> 02:40:57.644]  There is a hatred of this country, and there's a hatred of the institution of marriage, too.
[02:40:58.927 --> 02:41:01.027]  Which I hope I have a new book out on.
[02:41:01.048 --> 02:41:02.728]  Yeah, let's segway into that.
[02:41:02.788 --> 02:41:12.430]  Let's segway into the attack on religion, the attack on marriage, Obama's... Well, my last book is No Higher Power, Obama's War on Religious Freedom.
[02:41:12.850 --> 02:41:16.370]  And you can see that everywhere, the people who want to be politically correct.
[02:41:17.131 --> 02:41:24.552]  Even the military has done some things like clamping down on prayers and the oath to serve God and country, so help me God.
[02:41:25.272 --> 02:41:31.295]  And the superintendents of the public schools are going after little kids.
[02:41:31.395 --> 02:41:34.917]  Won't let them mention Jesus or sing a Christmas carol.
[02:41:35.037 --> 02:41:38.059]  Or bring a Christmas card even though everybody else is allowed to do whatever they want.
[02:41:38.119 --> 02:41:38.399]  Yeah.
[02:41:39.539 --> 02:41:42.261]  And it's a real war on the First Amendment.
[02:41:42.761 --> 02:41:51.746]  Obama's idea about the First Amendment is you should have the right to go into your church and lock the door and say a prayer where nobody can hear you.
[02:41:52.026 --> 02:41:53.106]  And that'll be okay.
[02:41:53.306 --> 02:41:54.667]  He's not going to take that away from you.
[02:41:54.707 --> 02:42:04.035]  And by the way, for those that don't know, the First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:42:04.415 --> 02:42:16.725]  It means you don't have a state-run religion, but you could absolutely come to school and you can hand out Christmas cards, you could hand out Muslim material during a lunch break, you could hand out atheist material.
[02:42:17.926 --> 02:42:21.489]  As a valedictorian, you can give whatever speech you want and thank God.
[02:42:21.809 --> 02:42:23.210]  As a football player, you can.
[02:42:23.310 --> 02:42:34.817]  And they know that, and they are persecuting people where they find Bibles in people's bags in public school in Texas and quote, throw them in the trash and suspend them.
[02:42:35.117 --> 02:42:37.259]  This is outrageous authoritarianism.
[02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:48.590]  And of course, the founding fathers and all presidents prior to Obama were quoting their faith and their belief in God all the time, honoring the National Day of Prayer.
[02:42:48.610 --> 02:42:56.458]  For example, when Obama gives a Thanksgiving Day address, he makes a whole long list of people to thank, but God didn't make the cut.
[02:42:57.442 --> 02:43:01.843]  And he's just trying to eliminate any public mention of God.
[02:43:02.583 --> 02:43:08.625]  Our country was built on people believing in God and being religious people and people of faith.
[02:43:08.845 --> 02:43:12.545]  Why is it that the collectivist and Soviet types hate God?
[02:43:12.585 --> 02:43:17.307]  Is it because obviously the state is God and they don't want any higher power above them?
[02:43:17.667 --> 02:43:18.507]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:43:19.727 --> 02:43:22.528]  They want the state to be in control of everything.
[02:43:23.148 --> 02:43:23.768]  And we don't.
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:27.081]  And we've got a proven best country.
[02:43:28.141 --> 02:43:29.721]  That's why people want to come here.
[02:43:30.541 --> 02:43:34.902]  And it's the most freedom, it's the most prosperity.
[02:43:34.922 --> 02:43:49.165]  Obama has this nutty idea that it really isn't fair that the United States has so much good things of life and more prosperity than any other country and more power than other countries.
[02:43:49.565 --> 02:43:51.045]  He wants to make everybody equal.
[02:43:51.505 --> 02:43:53.747]  And we don't want to be equal to all the poor countries.
[02:43:54.087 --> 02:44:01.492]  And we don't want our guys to have to compete with people making products in Vietnam that work for 28 cents an hour.
[02:44:01.712 --> 02:44:10.197]  Well, it's not fair trade when we have all the regulations and bureaucracy and shutting down our power plants, and they go to Vietnam with no regulations, dumping the toxic waste right in the river.
[02:44:10.658 --> 02:44:13.219]  And this is all about Cloward and Piven making us dependent.
[02:44:13.279 --> 02:44:13.940]  In closing,
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:16.742]  Spend a few minutes on the attack on the family.
[02:44:16.802 --> 02:44:18.023]  It's so naked now.
[02:44:18.443 --> 02:44:19.544]  The attack on women.
[02:44:19.984 --> 02:44:21.325]  The attack on manhood.
[02:44:21.345 --> 02:44:27.050]  I mean, the MSNBC, I'm sure you've seen their promo where they say, your kids now belong to the state.
[02:44:27.430 --> 02:44:31.993]  I mean, these people are really being naked about their takeover.
[02:44:32.033 --> 02:44:32.954]  Why do you think that is?
[02:44:34.155 --> 02:44:39.479]  Well, they're feeling that they've won and they want to shock it to us.
[02:44:40.385 --> 02:44:59.172]  And the only way we can remain a free country is if parents are in control of their children, not the government, and if we are able to elect a congressman and representative who believes in limited government, lower taxes, and letting people spend their own money.
[02:44:59.941 --> 02:45:01.922]  And instead of the government spending it.
[02:45:02.562 --> 02:45:08.325]  And these are the issues that are so important in the upcoming elections this year.
[02:45:08.945 --> 02:45:11.426]  And I urge everybody to go into the primaries.
[02:45:11.446 --> 02:45:17.649]  You know, I hear people say in November, well, I don't like the guy on either party.
[02:45:18.209 --> 02:45:22.453]  Well, that's your fault that you weren't in there in the primaries getting the right guy on the ballot.
[02:45:22.913 --> 02:45:25.696]  Because he's not going to get elected unless he's on the ballot.
[02:45:25.836 --> 02:45:28.418]  Well, it's definitely a lesser of two evils, and I've never even been of that view.
[02:45:28.458 --> 02:45:31.020]  But the Democrats are going for total broke.
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:32.982]  The Republican leadership's trying to kill the Tea Party.
[02:45:33.302 --> 02:45:37.726]  We've got to get behind the Tea Party, which you're a proto-founder of, across the board.
[02:45:37.766 --> 02:45:42.511]  But I think about my grandmothers and how they interact with my grandfathers.
[02:45:42.571 --> 02:45:43.692]  Three of my grandparents are gone.
[02:45:43.792 --> 02:45:44.472]  One of them's still here.
[02:45:45.573 --> 02:46:01.327]  They weren't subservient women, but they were on a team in that family, and that family came first, and they were powerful, effective, smart women that, you know, would read to me for hours in the summer when I was visiting them, and who were super smart and had, you know, multiple degrees.
[02:46:01.347 --> 02:46:02.648]  Oh, they could read?
[02:46:02.668 --> 02:46:05.410]  Yeah, they could read, and they wanted a strong...
[02:46:06.311 --> 02:46:06.711]  It's
[02:46:25.367 --> 02:46:27.729]  That's the complete opposite of an empowered woman.
[02:46:27.749 --> 02:46:30.372]  You know, notice the feminists say, don't let women own guns.
[02:46:30.752 --> 02:46:37.278]  I mean, it's just so insane to see how they are destroying men, they're destroying women, all the things they're getting away with.
[02:46:37.298 --> 02:46:42.083]  It's so disgusting to see women becoming married to the state, basically.
[02:46:43.618 --> 02:46:44.239]  That's right!
[02:46:44.499 --> 02:46:53.588]  That's what you... You don't set up a family, a traditional man and woman, where the man is the provider and protector, and then all these babies appear.
[02:46:54.929 --> 02:46:57.032]  You look to Big Brother government to support you.
[02:46:57.492 --> 02:46:59.194]  And that's not the kind of country we want.
[02:46:59.892 --> 02:47:03.654]  Well, you're supposed to put the load on the men so they compete and make a stronger society.
[02:47:03.674 --> 02:47:06.875]  Not say, men are nobodies, they're idiots.
[02:47:07.196 --> 02:47:08.836]  Women, you're in charge with the state.
[02:47:09.337 --> 02:47:10.657]  And of course everything falls apart.
[02:47:10.677 --> 02:47:12.458]  I mean, look at illegitimacy in the black community.
[02:47:12.938 --> 02:47:16.800]  Less than 10% before the Great Society in the 60s.
[02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:18.161]  These are mainline numbers.
[02:47:18.461 --> 02:47:19.061]  Now upwards of 90%.
[02:47:20.202 --> 02:47:22.123]  And that same system's being deployed.
[02:47:22.623 --> 02:47:24.544]  It is a system-wrecking program.
[02:47:25.224 --> 02:47:29.425]  We're going to plug the website one more time, but I want to play you the clip since you mentioned it.
[02:47:30.105 --> 02:47:33.466]  Here is Obama saying, I've got a phone, I've got a pen.
[02:47:34.126 --> 02:47:43.548]  We are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we're providing Americans the kind of help that they need.
[02:47:43.708 --> 02:47:46.348]  I've got a pen and I've got a phone.
[02:47:46.468 --> 02:47:53.630]  And I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward.
[02:47:54.756 --> 02:48:08.072]  And then since we were mentioning MSNBC and PROMO saying your kids belong to him, here's Melissa Harris Perry, going from memory on her name, on there saying, you know, we need to get over this idea that your kids belong to you, they belong to the collective.
[02:48:08.753 --> 02:48:10.014]  A bunch of control freaks.
[02:48:10.675 --> 02:48:18.337]  And again, at the level of MSNBC host, they are known technocrats with a scientific, sociological takedown program.
[02:48:18.677 --> 02:48:19.538]  I've read their textbooks.
[02:48:19.558 --> 02:48:21.958]  These are cold-blooded culture killers.
[02:48:22.239 --> 02:48:24.999]  Let's play that clip and then get Phyllis Shafley's take on it.
[02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:33.162]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:48:33.562 --> 02:48:38.605]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the household's, then we start making better investments.
[02:48:38.685 --> 02:48:44.748]  And once they get you into government healthcare, they're going to run your life because, well, we're all having to pay for your healthcare.
[02:48:44.808 --> 02:48:55.153]  If you let Obama appoint any more judges, you know the 9th Circuit said that parents' rights to control their own children stops at the threshold of the school door.
[02:48:55.693 --> 02:48:56.834]  And the schools take over.
[02:48:57.514 --> 02:48:59.055]  And we cannot allow that to happen.
[02:48:59.924 --> 02:49:01.065]  It's unbelievable.
[02:49:01.546 --> 02:49:06.711]  Every nightmare visited upon the Soviet Union and other collectivist hellholes is now manifesting.
[02:49:08.833 --> 02:49:13.798]  In closing, and I appreciate you coming on, what is your gut level about this battle?
[02:49:14.359 --> 02:49:15.420]  How bad is it going to get?
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:18.323]  I mean, I know we're going to win in the end, but how hellish is this going to get?
[02:49:19.396 --> 02:49:22.978]  Well, I think the elections this year are absolutely crucial.
[02:49:23.018 --> 02:49:25.419]  They may be the most important elections of our time.
[02:49:25.879 --> 02:49:32.863]  And I urge everybody to go into, especially the Republican primaries, and make sure you get good guys on the ballot.
[02:49:33.263 --> 02:49:36.885]  So that when we come to November, you've got a good guy to vote for.
[02:49:36.905 --> 02:49:40.747]  You're not standing around saying, I don't like either guy on either party.
[02:49:42.139 --> 02:49:49.848]  It's time to get really aggressive and run for City Council, run for County Commissioner, run for Water Commissioner, get in the PTA.
[02:49:50.229 --> 02:49:50.589]  Fight it!
[02:49:50.649 --> 02:50:01.843]  Go on Eagle Farm's website because we will have a list of endorsed candidates for the Senate and the House and that might be helpful to you in deciding who to vote for.
[02:50:02.205 --> 02:50:04.666]  Absolutely, and that's EagleForum.org.
[02:50:04.926 --> 02:50:06.546]  We've only got 30-40 seconds left.
[02:50:07.126 --> 02:50:07.926]  What's it been like?
[02:50:08.146 --> 02:50:08.767]  You're 89.
[02:50:08.847 --> 02:50:11.147]  What's it been like, Phyllis, battling this hard?
[02:50:11.207 --> 02:50:11.987]  Is it satisfying?
[02:50:12.888 --> 02:50:14.048]  Well, yes.
[02:50:14.268 --> 02:50:23.230]  I hope that a lot of good people are active in politics so that we can keep this self-governing country and not let it slip through our fingers and get away from us.
[02:50:23.672 --> 02:50:25.654]  All right, God bless you, thank you for all you do.
[02:50:25.914 --> 02:50:26.234]  God bless.
[02:50:26.294 --> 02:50:27.856]  There goes Philip Schlafly.
[02:50:28.016 --> 02:50:28.256]  Wow.
[02:50:29.317 --> 02:50:33.200]  I mean, I tried to stop Obamacare and I got called a racist.
[02:50:33.561 --> 02:50:37.184]  I'm trying to stop the total end of our borders that the big banks want and I'm a racist.
[02:50:37.764 --> 02:50:41.568]  Man, I want people in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia, in Europe.
[02:50:42.268 --> 02:50:44.509]  To be literally bathing in wealth.
[02:50:44.909 --> 02:50:47.390]  Space stations, whole nine yards, okay?
[02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:48.710]  I want you to succeed.
[02:50:49.371 --> 02:50:52.112]  I'm desperately trying to stop forced cardinal shots in Mexico.
[02:50:52.532 --> 02:50:53.952]  Sterilizing all those people down there.
[02:50:55.153 --> 02:50:56.593]  The globalists want to hurt everybody, folks.
[02:50:57.013 --> 02:51:00.695]  We cannot pay for illegal aliens and legalize the next group.
[02:51:02.086 --> 02:51:05.287]  And I want to just tell all the illegals that the system does not care about you.
[02:51:05.327 --> 02:51:06.107]  Get that through your head.
[02:51:06.467 --> 02:51:07.948]  And all the fake liberals out there.
[02:51:07.988 --> 02:51:08.708]  You people are sick.
[02:51:09.488 --> 02:51:12.049]  Did you know that gold and silver contain healing properties?
[02:51:12.289 --> 02:51:12.729]  It's true.
[02:51:12.910 --> 02:51:19.332]  Since the beginning of mankind's history, gold and silver have not only been used as real money, but also for healing our minds and bodies.
[02:51:19.612 --> 02:51:26.634]  UtopiaSilver.com is your leading source for colloidal silver and colloidal gold supplement protocols that can heal and enhance your health.

[02:51:33.287 --> 02:51:35.892]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A-Silver.com.
[02:51:35.992 --> 02:51:38.857]  Fighting for liberty and healing one American at a time.
[02:51:40.325 --> 02:51:41.725]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[02:51:41.845 --> 02:51:44.526]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[02:51:44.686 --> 02:51:49.368]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[02:51:49.528 --> 02:51:54.729]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.
[02:51:54.869 --> 02:52:01.451]  My Magic Mud is a soft powder that polishes your teeth, reduces sensitivity, and removes harmful toxins from deep inside your mouth.
[02:52:01.571 --> 02:52:03.492]  You deserve a bright, healthy smile.
[02:52:03.552 --> 02:52:05.992]  Visit MyMagicMud.com and get yours today.
[02:52:06.112 --> 02:52:07.973]  That's MyMagicMud.com.
[02:52:09.341 --> 02:52:09.781]  Attention!
[02:52:09.962 --> 02:52:12.584]  If you'd like to improve your vision naturally, listen closely.
[02:52:12.784 --> 02:52:13.064]  Fact.
[02:52:13.224 --> 02:52:18.448]  Clinical studies show you can improve night vision, sharpen focus, and reduce eye strain using natural nutrients.
[02:52:18.728 --> 02:52:19.009]  Fact.
[02:52:19.169 --> 02:52:25.334]  You won't see the results you deserve with drugstore brands because these proven vision-boosting nutrients are missing in most eye supplements.
[02:52:25.514 --> 02:52:29.417]  Dr. Julian Whitaker has sold 4 million bottles of his Vision Essentials formula.
[02:52:29.497 --> 02:52:37.582]  With the clinical levels of all, 17 must have nutrients for better night vision and better visual acuity with less eye strain and fatigue in as little as 30 days.
[02:52:37.802 --> 02:52:44.327]  Don't settle for cheap supplements, uninformed doctors who say there's nothing you can do, or vitamins that only cover some of the nutrients.
[02:52:44.527 --> 02:52:45.167]  It's a fact.
[02:52:45.307 --> 02:52:52.232]  You can enjoy improved night vision, sharpen your vision, and focus more easily with less eye strain and fatigue in as little as 30 days.
[02:52:52.432 --> 02:52:54.313]  Improve the health of your eyes today.
[02:52:54.493 --> 02:52:57.235]  Vision Essentials will change the way you see the world.
[02:52:57.295 --> 02:53:02.538]  To get a free bottle of Vision Essentials for just the cost of shipping and processing, call 1-800-901-6779.
[02:53:02.558 --> 02:53:04.320]  800-901-6779.
[02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:04.900]  800-901-6779.
[02:53:05.060 --> 02:53:19.150]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:53:19.450 --> 02:53:21.291]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:53:21.471 --> 02:53:22.151]  Fluoride.
[02:53:22.351 --> 02:53:24.152]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:53:24.272 --> 02:53:30.574]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:53:30.814 --> 02:53:33.614]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:53:33.734 --> 02:53:35.575]  And the results are on record.
[02:53:35.715 --> 02:53:38.896]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[02:53:39.156 --> 02:53:41.757]  In areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:53:41.998 --> 02:53:44.139]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:53:44.399 --> 02:53:46.980]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:53:47.300 --> 02:53:50.642]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:53:50.782 --> 02:53:55.985]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[02:53:56.185 --> 02:54:00.967]  Infowarslife Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:54:02.448 --> 02:54:05.289]  That's Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:54:25.341 --> 02:54:27.383]  Japan's preparing for war with China.
[02:54:27.943 --> 02:54:29.465]  Hinting they've got hidden nukes.
[02:54:29.485 --> 02:54:31.807]  School shooting experts.
[02:54:32.948 --> 02:54:35.130]  Threatened over Sandy Hook investigation.
[02:54:35.150 --> 02:54:37.432]  That's some interesting breaking news.
[02:54:39.232 --> 02:54:40.013]  Another headline.
[02:54:40.053 --> 02:54:41.494]  Let's read the polls about amnesty.
[02:54:41.514 --> 02:54:44.116]  We've reposted what Phyllis Schlafly was just talking about.
[02:54:44.696 --> 02:54:50.240]  Johnny Carson's head writer, Hans Leno, was ditched over Obama jokes.
[02:54:50.460 --> 02:54:52.001]  I already basically know that.
[02:54:54.823 --> 02:54:56.064]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:54:56.925 --> 02:55:04.570]  Breaking police advice on protesters in Ukraine, and it's showing that the West is basically funding all that.
[02:55:05.931 --> 02:55:07.853]  71% wish they'd not voted for Obama.
[02:55:08.752 --> 02:55:09.913]  I think it looks really great.
[02:55:30.129 --> 02:55:33.731]  We're going to launch it either later this week or early next week.
[02:55:33.771 --> 02:55:36.472]  I'm not going to procrastinate anymore and we'll do some tweaks on it and stuff.
[02:55:37.092 --> 02:55:38.093]  So I gotta go mess with that.
[02:55:38.533 --> 02:55:41.094]  And about to launch the new studio and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:55:41.114 --> 02:55:41.835]  We're finally there.
[02:55:42.215 --> 02:55:43.535]  Thanks to all your prayers and support.
[02:55:43.555 --> 02:55:46.937]  And I will go to break and come back and take a few calls.
[02:55:47.337 --> 02:55:49.238]  First off, paying the bills here.
[02:55:49.258 --> 02:55:50.239]  It's our great sponsors.

[02:56:06.170 --> 02:56:07.552]  We got sponsors beating down the door.
[02:56:07.572 --> 02:56:09.033]  I could have ten storable food companies.
[02:56:09.093 --> 02:56:09.373]  I don't.
[02:56:09.693 --> 02:56:10.174]  I have one.
[02:56:10.194 --> 02:56:10.234]  866-229-0927.
[02:56:10.634 --> 02:56:12.376]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:19.182]  And don't forget our different websites.
[02:56:19.643 --> 02:56:21.845]  We've got the new Molon Labe Second Amendment shirts.
[02:56:21.865 --> 02:56:23.746]  It's one of the best out there, our best seller ever.
[02:56:24.127 --> 02:56:25.128]  I knew it would be, and it is.
[02:56:26.269 --> 02:56:28.030]  Really wakes folks up about come and take it.
[02:56:28.411 --> 02:56:31.393]  Great way to spread the word and to meet like-minded patriots.
[02:56:31.914 --> 02:56:37.499]  That's available at MadeIn1776.com, subsection of InfowarsStore.com.
[02:56:37.539 --> 02:56:39.921]  It takes you to all the Made in America apparel.

[02:56:45.445 --> 02:56:47.466]  And then it funds our entire operation.
[02:56:47.506 --> 02:56:50.969]  And there's InfoWarsLife.com, which is also an InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:56:51.009 --> 02:56:57.253]  It just takes you to the, you go to InfoWarsLife.com, directly to the subsection of the four products we have out.

[02:57:13.624 --> 02:57:14.404]  Two different blends.
[02:57:14.725 --> 02:57:15.645]  It's my favorite coffee.
[02:57:15.685 --> 02:57:16.326]  Everybody loves it.
[02:57:16.406 --> 02:57:17.306]  Orr says it's their favorite.

[02:57:31.074 --> 02:57:33.595]  And we are self-funded, the old-fashioned Americana way.
[02:57:34.095 --> 02:57:43.758]  We're not funded like MSNBC with taxpayer bailouts, stimulus money, or NPR, or the Rockefeller Foundation in tax money, who's also anti-gun openly.
[02:57:43.778 --> 02:57:44.618]  That's an article out today.
[02:57:44.958 --> 02:57:47.899]  We're funded by you checking out the products, liking them.

[02:58:11.236 --> 02:58:12.477]  You don't need to buy anything from us.
[02:58:12.897 --> 02:58:14.718]  Tell friends and family about the broadcast.
[02:58:14.899 --> 02:58:16.119]  That's how we defeat the enemy.
[02:58:17.586 --> 02:58:18.567]  Support your local A.M.
[02:58:18.587 --> 02:58:18.907]  and F.M.
[02:58:18.987 --> 02:58:19.467]  affiliates.
[02:58:20.027 --> 02:58:23.329]  Buy local sponsor time with them or support local sponsors.
[02:58:23.389 --> 02:58:24.049]  Go check them out.
[02:58:24.090 --> 02:58:24.790]  Drive out of your way.
[02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:28.032]  Tell them I came here because you're on a local station on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:28.972 --> 02:58:32.454]  That's how we continue to be on a growing list of over 160 A.M.
[02:58:32.474 --> 02:58:33.514]  and F.M.
[02:58:33.535 --> 02:58:34.655]  stations across the country.
[02:58:34.975 --> 02:58:38.197]  Thank you all out there for the wonderful job you're doing.
[02:58:38.237 --> 02:58:41.419]  Getting us on those stations and those stations carrying us.
[02:58:42.419 --> 02:58:44.862]  And to everybody else out there that helps us, you know we love you.
[02:58:45.202 --> 02:58:46.523]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:46.583 --> 02:58:47.644]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:47.704 --> 02:58:48.405]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:50.066 --> 02:58:51.868]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:53.570 --> 02:58:55.612]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:59.346 --> 02:59:09.733]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:59:10.033 --> 02:59:11.894]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:59:12.095 --> 02:59:12.775]  Fluoride!
[02:59:12.975 --> 02:59:14.556]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:59:14.896 --> 02:59:21.221]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:59:21.481 --> 02:59:26.284]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:59:26.404 --> 02:59:29.106]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[02:59:29.426 --> 02:59:29.928]  We're good.
