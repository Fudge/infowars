[00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:14.434]  First they assassinate your character, then they assassinate you.
[00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:19.079]  The vilification of Cliven Bundy by the mainstream media is now in full force.
[00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.061]  They've accused him of being a tax evader.
[00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:25.987]  But most troubling is this exchange, where the label of sovereign citizen is thrown at him.
[00:00:26.347 --> 00:00:31.893]  That's a hot-button label that effectively puts a bounty on his head as a terrorist as far as law enforcement is concerned.
[00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:41.661]  Your stance is, I do not recognize these lands to be federal, and you're on a one-man movement.
[00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:49.906]  Because of the way you're talking about sheriffs and you're talking about state sovereignty, they're claiming that you are potentially affiliated with the sovereign citizen movement.
[00:00:50.146 --> 00:00:51.847]  Is that something that you find yourself affiliated with?
[00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:53.068]  Do you think those people are crazy?
[00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:54.969]  No, I don't know.
[00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.030]  I don't know even what they are.
[00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:01.702]  Who needs a Southern Poverty Law Center when you've got people like Glenn Beck to do their work for them?
[00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:03.964]  Bundy was not saying he was a sovereign citizen.
[00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:09.509]  He was saying that the state of Nevada and the sheriff were sovereign here, that it was a jurisdictional issue.
[00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.252]  Glenn Beck and the Blaze should have known better.
[00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:19.636]  Bundy had tried to explain to Beck Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution, also known as the Enclave Clause.
[00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:32.122]  It's the clear intention of the Constitution to prohibit the federal government from owning large portions of state land, expressly limiting it to 10 square miles of the District of Columbia and to the land needed for forts and docks, etc.
[00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:43.066]  It's a violation of both the intent and the letter of the Constitution for the federal government to claim ownership over millions of acres of state land, including 90% of Nevada.
[00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:47.587]  And the mainstream media is spinning the trespass cattle angle as well.
[00:01:47.768 --> 00:01:55.750]  You know, if you had the idea that anyone that has cattle, Donnie's included, could just let them off grazing anywhere, that's not libertarianism, it's anarchy.
[00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:59.372]  No, it's Nevada law, not anarchy.
[00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.451]  This lady from England doesn't know anything about American cattle laws.
[00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:13.335]  In areas under open range law, cattle are free to wander and the cattle's owner is not responsible for damage to property unless they entered land enclosed by a legal fence.
[00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:19.778]  As a matter of fact, Nevada open range law criminalizes harassment of livestock on the open range.
[00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:26.721]  Livestock owners are also exempted from damages related to animals even on highways that pass through the open range.
[00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:31.614]  That's why there were warning signs as you entered the open range area.
[00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:35.940]  Now they took down those warning signs and then put them back up again while we were there.
[00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:43.591]  In the east, most states have what's called herd district laws where the owners must keep their cattle fenced in or be liable.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.581]  I guess you could say this English lady had a herd mentality.
[00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:55.462]  Former Congressman Joe Scarborough completely ignores the jurisdictional issues and effectively labels him a welfare rancher.
[00:02:55.482 --> 00:03:01.603]  This guy for 20 years has been breaking the law using federal land.
[00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:05.524]  He hasn't been paying the grazing fees that everybody else pays.
[00:03:05.564 --> 00:03:12.445]  For some reason, this guy thinks that the laws that apply to every other rancher in the United States of America don't apply to him.
[00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:18.689]  I guess Joe Scarborough would say that Rosa Parks thinks that laws that apply to other blacks don't apply to her.
[00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:28.255]  The laws that required her to sit in the back of the bus were both a violation of the Constitution's equal protection of the law as well as a violation of moral law.
[00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:35.300]  First, I did not consider myself defying a court order that particular day.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.443]  I consulted with my attorneys before the march and they stated that
[00:03:41.424 --> 00:03:44.126]  They felt that it was an invalid order.
[00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:51.891]  On the other hand, I must be honest enough to say that I do feel that there are two types of laws.
[00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:54.713]  One is a just law and one is an unjust law.
[00:03:55.333 --> 00:04:00.176]  I think we all have moral obligations to obey just laws.
[00:04:00.317 --> 00:04:05.480]  On the other hand, I think we have moral obligations to disobey unjust laws because
[00:04:06.252 --> 00:04:12.216]  Non-cooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good.
[00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:14.157]  Yes, Bundy lost in a federal court.
[00:04:14.217 --> 00:04:15.538]  But remember, it was the U.S.
[00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:21.843]  Supreme Court that told a slave who was trying to get his freedom, Dred Scott, that he had to return to slavery.
[00:04:22.383 --> 00:04:31.509]  And it was just last November in a tax court that a judge instructed the jury and said, it doesn't matter if what I am saying is unlawful or unconstitutional.
[00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:34.051]  Do what I say or face contempt.
[00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:37.113]  Look, this rancher has had his day in court and lost.
[00:04:37.594 --> 00:04:43.159]  He had his day in court in a federal court, in which the issue was, who owns this land?
[00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:46.382]  You, the state of Nevada, or the federal government?
[00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:50.706]  In my view, that case should have been tried in a state court and not in a federal court.
[00:04:50.746 --> 00:04:58.313]  The federal government, even the judiciary, the federal judiciary, should not be deciding what land the federal government owns.
[00:04:58.613 --> 00:05:08.117]  I was in the federal courts in Las Vegas when the ranchers scraped together enough money to try to appeal the ruling for them to remove the cattle off of this land.
[00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:09.918]  They said, you're ruling this.
[00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:11.759]  We can't remove this cattle.
[00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.180]  This is the only time of year there's any decent feed.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.241]  They appealed it to the federal court.
[00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:20.866]  They hired one lawyer, Karen Budd was her name, from Colorado.
[00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:26.208]  She stood up there and made a case that documented that the ranchers had improved the range.
[00:05:26.588 --> 00:05:28.448]  There were more turtles than before.
[00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:30.549]  That the range is more productive.
[00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:37.051]  And not only that, they're producing a commodity that benefits all of society off of a desert.
[00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:44.253]  There's only a couple people I know that's tough enough to live out here and make something worthwhile out of it.
[00:05:44.473 --> 00:05:46.514]  But, this doesn't judge.
[00:05:49.053 --> 00:05:54.838]  Clinton administration, and he stood up and said, I'm finding in favor of the ranchers.
[00:05:56.239 --> 00:06:09.809]  And during this whole case, the BLM's lawyers, the state of Nevada's lawyers, the conservation group, we had all the greenies there, every one of their lawyers got up to speak every time anything was said.
[00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:18.056]  And after they had lost the case, obviously they stood up, and the only thing they had to say was, you have no jurisdiction over
[00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:40.484]  When the bureaucracy realized that it was losing and said that the court didn't have jurisdiction, Mr. Bundy realized that the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management, was going beyond simply managing the land and using the grazing fees to pay for that management.
[00:06:40.724 --> 00:06:44.145]  It was using those grazing fees to drive ranchers out of business.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:54.763]  And under regulation, right now there's not a person standing here, a business in this country that can't be destroyed through federal regulation and harassment.
[00:06:55.183 --> 00:07:00.425]  It's the IRS, it's OSHA, it's everywhere you look.
[00:07:01.274 --> 00:07:08.196]  We have scores of alphabet agencies that write regulations that can shut down your small business or even entire industries.
[00:07:08.577 --> 00:07:14.759]  They can seize your property without compensation, not using eminent domain, not even giving you a jury trial.
[00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:22.941]  They write laws, they judge the laws, whether or not you're guilty of their own laws, and then they enforce them with their own police forces.
[00:07:23.482 --> 00:07:27.263]  They certainly can support him any way they want, but the guy needs to abide by the law.
[00:07:27.543 --> 00:07:29.205]  Yeah, I think, you know, it's why we have elections.
[00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:33.451]  If you don't agree with the law, you have a democratic process by which you can try and overturn the law.
[00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:35.053]  She said that's why we have elections?
[00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:39.899]  Well, the BLM is not on my ballot, and it's not on your ballot.
[00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:45.065]  It's not just taxation without representation, it's regulation without representation.
[00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:49.547]  The founders were concerned that power would be consolidated into one place.
[00:07:50.247 --> 00:07:58.830]  That's why they created a system of checks and balances, dividing power not only between the three branches of government, but between the federal government, the state government, and the people.
[00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.270]  The Tenth Amendment matters.
[00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.930]  The Enclave Clause matters.
[00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.851]  The Constitution matters.
[00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:18.520]  We need officials at the state and local level who will obey the Constitution, who understand how important it is to have a balance between federal and state government, who have the backbone to stand up and to do their constitutional duty.
[00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:23.163]  That's the only way that we're going to get control and balance back in our government.
[00:08:23.684 --> 00:08:25.605]  That's what this is really about.
