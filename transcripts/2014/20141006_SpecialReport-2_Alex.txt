[00:00:07.586 --> 00:00:09.688]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:15.914]  Chevrolet has announced the release of their new 2015 Corvette Z06 model.
[00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:20.899]  Well, it has a very, very creepy feature that's going to be in it.
[00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.280]  It is called valet mode.
[00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:29.066]  The new feature of GM's sports car is part of the Performance Data Recorder called Valet Mode.
[00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:40.596]  It is a high-tech equipment that allows vet owners to secretly record conversations in its interior, as well as the information about its performance even when they're not in the car.
[00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:43.658]  Think about that.
[00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:45.120]  Your car
[00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:47.784]  is going to spy on you.
[00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:52.406]  Whatever conversations you have, whatever it is you do, they're recording it.
[00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:53.807]  They are listening to it.
[00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:55.168]  Now listen to this.
[00:00:56.208 --> 00:01:00.651]  This is crazy because Harlan Charles is the Corvette product manager.
[00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:11.657]  He says anyone who has ever felt apprehension about handing over their keys will appreciate the peace of mind of knowing exactly what happened while their baby was out of sight.
[00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:14.999]  Think of it as a baby monitor for your car.
[00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:26.170]  So, they're taking away your right to privacy so you can have this peace of mind to have this expensive toy.
[00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:42.855]  They're using it under the beard that when you go and take your fancy brand new Chevy Corvette to a restaurant, to a club, and valet has it, it's to give you peace of mind because in case they decide to go on a joyride, it's not because they want to store and collect that on you.
[00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:43.775]  We're good to go!
[00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:04.524]  So the NSA can listen in to your calls now.
[00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:15.596]  We already know, I showed you the video last week of my Samsung Galaxy, how inside the user agreement it's saying that the NSA can spy on you and they're not liable for any data loss.
[00:02:16.383 --> 00:02:16.623]  Anything
[00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:35.185]  We're good to go.
[00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:58.877]  So apparently the company never got the memo that secret recordings are illegal in many states.
[00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:02.060]  This truly is an Orwellian age that we live in.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.926]  Don't let the new trendy, cool Corvette be a tool to take your liberties away, your right to privacy.
[00:03:09.447 --> 00:03:11.549]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
