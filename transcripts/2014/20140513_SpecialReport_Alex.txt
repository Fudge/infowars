[00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:17.860]  Just when you thought occult worship couldn't get more mainstream, the Illuminati's media is now actively promoting the use of young blood in the quest to live forever.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.562]  Scientists have apparently found a way to reverse the effects of aging.
[00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:27.926]  Now this one sounds like something out of the movies, but young blood could be the key to reversing aging.
[00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:33.469]  Some are calling it vampire therapy, others see it potentially as the fountain of youth.
[00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:42.023]  It was something, a cross between vampire and Frankenstein, where they took two animals and they hooked their blood supply together for four weeks, called parabiosis.
[00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:49.450]  Imagine if you could turn back the clock 5, 10, even 15 years and reverse the effects of aging.
[00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.031]  Fascinating.
[00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.891]  It's a fascinating study actually.
[00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:53.432]  It's so fascinating.
[00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:55.053]  Indeed, fascinating.
[00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:59.874]  What once was reserved for gothic novels is now confirmed by scientists.
[00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:06.777]  They found that young blood actually recharges the brain, forms new blood vessels, and improves memory and learning.
[00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:15.319]  So far, the findings pertain to a particular strain of mice, but if results can be replicated in other strains, human trials won't be far off.
[00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.400]  And the beauty business is already using blood to give that youthful glow.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.621]  Ever the trendsetter, Kim Kardashian got a vampire facial.
[00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:32.003]  The gruesome procedure involves the reinjection of the patient's own blood platelets back into the skin in an effort to rejuvenate the face.
[00:01:32.023 --> 00:01:33.904]  I think my skin looks better.
[00:01:34.913 --> 00:01:35.073]  No.
[00:01:35.473 --> 00:01:37.954]  Maybe now she can try it with Baby North's blood.
[00:01:38.354 --> 00:01:46.678]  Now I'm not gonna lie, I am open to the thought of looking and feeling 15 years younger, but nobody is explaining who's gonna be supplying the baby's blood.
[00:01:47.298 --> 00:01:51.140]  Will we begin breeding humans simply for their ability to donate blood?
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.862]  The value of a child's life has already diminished in some circles to no more than their useful byproducts.
[00:01:57.302 --> 00:02:02.128]  An energy plant in Oregon burns aborted babies from Canada to generate electricity.
[00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:09.917]  And aborted babies are used to heat hospitals in the UK, their life force used in a waste-to-energy program.
[00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:15.864]  And one woman even posted a video of her abortion on YouTube in her narcissistic pursuit of fame.
[00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:17.526]  I just want to share my story.
[00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:25.350]  But what strikes me about this new science is how the belief that the fountain of youth can be tapped with young blood has been around forever.
[00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.312]  Throughout history, cultures across the globe have extolled the properties of youthful blood.
[00:02:30.753 --> 00:02:34.975]  Children are sacrificed, and the blood of young warriors was drunk by the victors.
[00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:40.100]  Lady Bathory was rumored to bathe in the blood of virgins to preserve her youthful looks.
[00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:44.826]  And of course, there's vampires who live forever by draining the blood of their victims.
[00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:49.592]  And the story goes, vamps find babies' blood the most rejuvenating.
[00:02:50.252 --> 00:02:53.116]  Some admit drinking blood for the energy they receive.
[00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:56.116]  I get irritable without it.
[00:02:56.517 --> 00:02:57.237]  I get angry.
[00:02:57.718 --> 00:02:58.979]  I don't want to leave my house.
[00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:00.220]  I want my blood.
[00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.442]  Drinking blood is trendy.
[00:03:02.702 --> 00:03:05.105]  Just ask Kesha, the queen of occult pop.
[00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:09.629]  And Satanists exalt the power found in the life force of children.
[00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.353]  Details of the history of child sacrifice are written about in Bloodlines of the Illuminati by Fritz Springmeier.
[00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:20.576]  A baby must be sacrificed to Satan in exchange for power.
[00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:29.382]  Springmeier notes how it's not the family name itself that holds the power for the Illuminati, but the very occultic blood pulsing through their veins.
[00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:35.247]  Hence all the intermarrying between these families, to keep the potency of their bloodline pure.
[00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:42.791]  Youthful life force is wildly attractive to the powerful who find covert ways to feed their insatiable thirst.
[00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:48.473]  The Franklin cover-up reveals one of the biggest pedophile scandals in the history of the USA.
[00:03:49.073 --> 00:03:54.795]  Boy prostitutes 15 years old and younger were taking midnight tours of the White House.
[00:03:55.475 --> 00:04:02.497]  And across the pond, BBC host Jimmy Savile was found to be involved in a child sex ring for VIPs.
[00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:12.934]  Interesting to note, Savile's good buddy Prince Charles is a direct descendant of Vlad the Impaler, who you might know by his other name, Dracula.
