[00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:21.100]  From Portland, Oregon to now our current location at Laguna Beach, California, we are burning the midnight oil to give you the most accurate and up-to-date information concerning radiation levels on the West Coast.
[00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:28.636]  Now, we've seen the top experts and the top scientists say that a plume of Fukushima radiation will contact the United States sometime in 2014.
[00:00:29.557 --> 00:00:40.029]  So, our original location, Surface Beach, located at Half Moon Bay, we encountered radiation levels about 10 times or excessive 10 times of what's considered normal for that location.
[00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.152]  Now, going north of Half Moon Bay,
[00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:43.012]  We're good to go.
[00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:14.192]  From these excessively high levels of radiation, whether they're naturally occurring, whatever they are, does Obamacare cover you in those instances?
[00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:19.517]  And I'm more than a little bit skeptical that even if it does cover you, will you get the proper diagnosis?
[00:01:19.697 --> 00:01:22.840]  Because our viewers may recall I went to an Obamacare kiosk
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.187]  And I'll say that I think I was improperly diagnosed with a few health elements that I don't believe that I have.
[00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:31.510]  So, you know, will this cover you?
[00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.531]  Will this help you at all?
[00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:33.773]  I would say no.
[00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:35.335]  So be aware of these things.
[00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:42.303]  Educate yourself because the government is definitely preparing themselves by acquiring 14 million doses of potassium iodide.
[00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:43.143]  We're good to go.
