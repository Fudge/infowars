[00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:14.728]  So we're at Super Bowl XLVIII.
[00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:16.609]  A very rabid fan.
[00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:26.793]  I really wish this guy would be outside yelling at the Federal Reserve or yelling about TSA's fine or about the TSA filling you up or the NSA's fine.
[00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:29.675]  I really wish we could use this energy to a better use.
[00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.496]  And if you want to come out to the Super Bowl, that's great.
[00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:34.497]  But you know, use these energies for something productive.
[00:00:34.817 --> 00:00:36.458]  We saw the halftime show a little bit ago.
[00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:48.691]  Bruno Mars, Red Hot Chili Peppers, they have the spinning pyramids down on the field, and also the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I guess they decided at the Super Bowl to switch out the half-naked women for half-naked men.
[00:00:49.192 --> 00:01:00.440]  So, Super Bowl XLVIII, a bunch of guys come out here dressed up, and that's cool if you want to dress up like your favorite team, but just like that guy we saw a second ago, use those energies, use your power for something positive and something productive.
