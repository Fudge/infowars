[00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:21.656]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:25.618]  It is Friday, November 7th, 2014, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:27.098]  Here are tonight's top stories.
[00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.639]  Tonight.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.842]  Houston residents are urged to play dead in the event of a home invasion.
[00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.643]  And the tale of Bin Laden's death.
[00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:39.844]  Osama Bin Laden!
[00:00:39.864 --> 00:00:41.965]  And he goes, who's asking?
[00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:44.186]  I'm like, the U.S.
[00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:44.966]  of A, mother******.
[00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:46.707]  Bam.
[00:00:47.908 --> 00:00:48.568]  That's next.
[00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:54.801]  Well, former Navy SEAL reveals that he is the man that killed Huffmagic Dragon.
[00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:56.444]  He promises he did.
[00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:07.678]  Well, if you are a member of the draconian EU government there in France today, well, I guess we can say that the stuff has hit the fan.
[00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:08.839]  Literally.
[00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:10.660]  Now, these are French farmers.
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:19.707]  They sprayed government buildings in Paris and Toulouse with feces today in protest against environmental regulations and high taxes.
[00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:28.414]  In a show of protest against expressing their anger at collapsing prices, increased environmental regulations, cheap imports and high costs,
[00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:33.335]  Thousands took to the streets dumping pumpkins, potatoes, and carrots.
[00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:40.097]  They burned cars, flung apples, and sprayed feces all over a government building in Toulouse.
[00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.158]  This is coming at a zero hedge.
[00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:44.838]  They say the French are not amused.
[00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:57.402]  Farmers protested against the French government's enforcement of a 1991 EU directive which forces farmers to make costly upgrades to infrastructure in order to comply with the regulation that's aimed at curbing
[00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:08.569]  Nitrate pollution, the government's stringent regulations don't apply to foreign competition, and of course this is a factor that is forcing many farmers there out of business.
[00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:22.257]  So of course the French have been struggling under massive economic woes, record unemployment, and now the farmers are fighting back because they're being put out of business so that the country can ship in all of these foreign goods.
[00:02:22.637 --> 00:02:23.578]  So that's a big issue.
[00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:25.700]  You've got to support local by local.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.066]  And they just decided they were going to dump all of this manure that they couldn't use right there at the feet of their government.
[00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:41.273]  But an economist has warned that rampant corruption combined with these economic woes are going to spark revolution here in the U.S.
[00:02:41.413 --> 00:02:41.833]  by 2016.
[00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:46.617]  Economist Martin Armstrong writes, that is the magic ingredient.
[00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:50.641]  Turn the economy down and you get civil unrest and revolution.
[00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:52.442]  Now we've reported that the U.S.
[00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:55.163]  Army is preparing for civil unrest in the U.S.
[00:02:55.603 --> 00:02:59.104]  citing a 132 page document entitled U.S.
[00:02:59.224 --> 00:03:12.689]  Army Techniques Publication 339 Civil Disturbances and it outlines how troops may be required to deal with unruly and violent crowds where it is necessary to quell riots and restore public order.
[00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.450]  Now these are the kind of riots that
[00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:37.775]  Rocked Ferguson Missouri earlier this year and of course are threatening to reignite should officer Darren Wilson be acquitted and of course those riots just illustrate how quickly things can escalate now the Atlanta Police Department is preparing for unrest of course in the aftermath of the grand jury verdict in the case of officer Darren Wilson that's expected to be announced this weekend
[00:03:38.275 --> 00:03:42.760]  The department is just one of many from across the country that are gearing up for potential disorder.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.489]  This should be if Wilson is acquitted of the August 9th killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown, and it's an outcome that is widely expected.
[00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.518]  Now peaceful protesters are of course welcome to exercise their First Amendment right, and I guarantee they're going to be out there in droves nationwide.
[00:03:59.998 --> 00:04:06.842]  But cops say that they are getting crowd control training to deal with those who may not want to be so peaceful.
[00:04:07.182 --> 00:04:19.730]  Now we've seen just exactly what that crowd control looks like there with the sound cannons and the rubber bullets shooting up our reporters as well as all of the peaceful protesters there in Ferguson.
[00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.933]  Now a source within the Missouri military revealed that troops were conducting drills to prepare for riots in Ferguson and St.
[00:04:27.953 --> 00:04:28.294]  Louis.
[00:04:28.654 --> 00:04:33.036]  Authorities say they were even planning on shutting down the airports if disorder got out of control.
[00:04:33.576 --> 00:04:39.659]  And Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told CNN that police must prepare for the worst.
[00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:50.121]  Now, we reported earlier this summer how some shop owners there in Ferguson were able to stave off any looters and violent attacks because they were armed with guns.
[00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:56.582]  Now, indeed, this is one of the main reasons for the right to keep and bear arms, to be able to protect yourself and your family.
[00:04:57.062 --> 00:05:04.084]  But in Houston, they are being given another set of solutions when faced with a home intruder.
[00:05:04.764 --> 00:05:08.165]  Basically telling people to lie down and play dead.
[00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:13.646]  This is a local news segment purporting to provide tips on how to survive a home invasion.
[00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:20.208]  They're advising faking a heart attack or fainting if faced with potentially violent intruders.
[00:05:20.548 --> 00:05:24.269]  Now, while most of the advice seems sensible, one tip in particular stands out.
[00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.590]  If you come face to face with an intruder and you're not prepared, lie down and don't look at them.
[00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.292]  Pretend to have a heart attack or breathing problem.
[00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:40.657]  So basically they're telling you if you come face-to-face with a potentially violent home intruder, your best bet is to lie down.
[00:05:41.198 --> 00:05:47.162]  Now, as a woman, I'm sorry, but I am not going to lie down when I'm faced with a violent situation.
[00:05:47.202 --> 00:05:56.808]  This is basically just making it easier for a would-be rapist to throw you over their shoulder and go do whatever they're planning on doing with you and your family.
[00:05:57.308 --> 00:05:59.530]  Nowhere in the report does it suggest
[00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.373]  Women, your only defense against a violent intruder would be a gun.
[00:06:04.793 --> 00:06:08.716]  They say, oh pick up a bat or any other heavy object.
[00:06:09.056 --> 00:06:15.480]  They never once mentioned in the report how better prepared you would be if you had a gun to protect your family.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.622]  They just want to teach you to lie down and take it.
[00:06:18.942 --> 00:06:20.263]  Hide under your bed.
[00:06:20.743 --> 00:06:25.807]  But a record number of Americans are now saying that they feel safer with a gun in the home.
[00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:33.552]  This is according to a new Gallup poll, and it indicates that almost two-thirds of Americans believe that having a gun at home makes them safer.
[00:06:33.572 --> 00:06:37.234]  That's more than 6 in 10, and that's double what it was in 2000.
[00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:43.697]  In 2000, it was just three in ten who said a gun in the home makes them feel safer.
[00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:50.039]  So sorry to all of you gun grabbers out there, but your false flag tactics are not working.
[00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:53.860]  People are going to continue exercising their Second Amendment right.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.502]  But what if the home invasion isn't about raping you and robbing you?
[00:06:59.742 --> 00:07:02.103]  What if it's about squatting indefinitely?
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.742]  She recently did a story about a woman who bought a house in Detroit and wanted to sell it.
[00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.944]  But a squatter had taken over the house and refused to leave.
[00:07:13.544 --> 00:07:14.585]  The police were called.
[00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:18.087]  But Lynn the squatter claimed the homeowner tried to run her over.
[00:07:18.627 --> 00:07:22.129]  The homeowner went to jail and Lynn moved her stuff back in the house.
[00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:23.530]  Now you're caught up.
[00:07:30.807 --> 00:07:34.770]  After watching that clip, I began wondering how common squatting was.
[00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.873]  Turns out my investigation didn't even have to leave the city of Detroit.
[00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.713]  After the reporter helped expose the squatters, she was attacked and had racial obscenities hurled at her.
[00:07:50.913 --> 00:07:52.074]  Why do people squat?
[00:07:52.594 --> 00:07:55.436]  How do they manage to get away with it for so long?
[00:07:55.876 --> 00:08:03.760]  Thelaw.tv reports, for adverse possession to work, squatters have to stay in a home for a minimum time period as mandated by the state.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.502]  This time frame varies widely by location.
[00:08:06.662 --> 00:08:10.804]  During that time, many states require the trespasser to have paid property taxes.
[00:08:11.064 --> 00:08:16.589]  Adverse possession was put on the books hundreds of years ago when the law primarily applied to farmland.
[00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:26.218]  Property records were easily lost and damaged then, and adverse possession was a way to keep the land in productive use when it wasn't clear who owned or inherited the land.
[00:08:26.378 --> 00:08:33.224]  So the origins of the practice began innocently enough, but the practice itself has been taken advantage of a great deal since then.
[00:08:33.524 --> 00:08:48.067]  Only an owner can initiate eviction proceedings and the problem here, this house is a foreclosure property that gave the squatters a loophole to hang out and ultimately trash this place and for a time, terrorize the neighborhood.
[00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:55.389]  Deputies went about it quickly and within moments, one tenant left with his bicycle, the other hopped on a skateboard and rolled away.
[00:08:55.888 --> 00:09:01.157]  So if you're a property owner, some of the best investments you can make would be steady fencing and sturdy locks.
[00:09:01.377 --> 00:09:04.642]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:05.657 --> 00:09:13.479]  Well, in the movies, the dystopic future always seems like a place far, far off, well beyond your and my lifetimes.
[00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:17.299]  Well, the Internet of Things is here, my friends.
[00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.980]  The dystopic future is now.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.021]  Amazon has introduced its new digital assistant this week.
[00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:30.562]  It's called Echo, and it's a cloud-connected device that will strive to fulfill your every need.
[00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:35.503]  Now, it will answer questions, provide weather updates, play music, and it'll even
[00:09:35.803 --> 00:09:40.829]  Tell jokes along with other mundane activities that you want to have it do for you.
[00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:45.334]  But it also does all of this by recording and responding to your voice.
[00:09:45.954 --> 00:09:48.617]  Now Echo is constantly connected to the cloud.
[00:09:48.898 --> 00:09:54.384]  This allows it to learn and adapt, slowly gathering the specifics of a user's characteristics.
[00:09:54.804 --> 00:10:01.550]  The more you use Echo, the more it adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences.
[00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:11.879]  And even though Amazon assures you that it only turns on when you say the wake word, there is no word on when it stops listening to you and recording
[00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:15.581]  All of your vocabulary and speech patterns and personal preferences.
[00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:33.389]  Now given Amazon's close relationship with both the NSA and CIA, and of course their history of selling privacy-invading devices, the safety of any collected personal information is in question, and especially in light of recent news surrounding cloud security.
[00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:50.555]  Now, the company is going to be hard-pressed to convince all of us that they're going to protect our private information and that the government isn't going to be able to access all of our home and even the most mundane appliances nowadays are being given this ability to track and record us.
[00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:53.657]  The dishwasher, light bulbs, it's everywhere.
[00:10:53.937 --> 00:11:02.220]  Basically, it's all hooked up to Wi-Fi and it gives hackers and the government instant access to anything that they need to ubiquitously spy on you
[00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:06.574]  And get access to every single detail of our lives.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.721]  Christmas is fast approaching.
[00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:19.143]  That means millions of people are going to be burning through their savings, lining up just to get their hands on the latest technology.
[00:11:19.563 --> 00:11:27.726]  Completely oblivious to the fact that they are actually paying to have their private conversations recorded and shared with third parties.
[00:11:28.027 --> 00:11:29.807]  Take the new Samsung Smart TV.
[00:11:30.047 --> 00:11:32.788]  The amount of data that this thing collects is staggering.
[00:11:33.049 --> 00:11:33.969]  Just say what you want.
[00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:41.533]  It logs where, when, how, and for how long you use the TV.
[00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:50.417]  It sets tracking cookies and beacons designed to detect when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message.
[00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:56.040]  It records the apps you use, the websites you visit, and how you interact with content.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:03.684]  And it, of course, has a built-in camera and microphone with facial and voice recognition for your convenience.
[00:12:04.244 --> 00:12:04.984]  They've been watching us.
[00:12:34.176 --> 00:12:38.321]  Writing about the privacy policy for Salon.com, Michael Price writes,
[00:12:55.439 --> 00:12:58.020]  There's no need for the FBI to bug your living room.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.361]  You'll do it yourself.
[00:12:59.961 --> 00:13:04.243]  In two years' time, the stuff that this Samsung TV can do will be old news.
[00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:05.383]  What's wrong?
[00:13:05.824 --> 00:13:09.465]  Let's say you're having a fight with your spouse in front of your television.
[00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:24.572]  Well, that camera and microphone that's been surreptitiously recording all of your private conversations and scanning your body language can now send that information to third-party advertisers so that they can air a perfectly timed commercial
[00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.834]  Suggesting some SSRIs.
[00:13:27.254 --> 00:13:30.016]  For them, it's all about targeted advertising.
[00:13:30.356 --> 00:13:34.960]  But for the surveillance apparatus, it's about complete information control.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.102]  Its primary intention is to transmit data.
[00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:49.351]  It receives data from smart appliances, which will be in your home, so that they can, you know, then immediately push back to you what they feel that you need in that moment for advertising purposes.
[00:13:49.911 --> 00:13:51.372]  It's not giving us more control.
[00:13:51.432 --> 00:14:03.740]  It's actually giving the control to big corporations, to utilities, and to governments who will be sharing in this data that is basically being extracted from the home in a very, very high level of detail.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.521]  All of this spying is documented.
[00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:07.042]  It's been going on for decades.
[00:14:07.302 --> 00:14:18.009]  And now people are just buying into the idea that they need all of these new smart appliances to save the earth and save on energy bills, when in reality, these devices are
[00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:18.730]  What's wrong?
[00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.211]  I need something stronger.
[00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:21.512]  Take four red capsules.
[00:14:21.893 --> 00:14:23.634]  In ten minutes, take two more.
[00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:24.896]  Help is on the way.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:47.348]  Well, coming up later in the show, I'm going to speak with the director of a new PSA that is aiming to mobilize the masses to stand up and end this corrupt fluoridation campaign.
[00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:54.273]  But first, InfoWars will bring you an exclusive sneak peek of Star Wars Episode VII.
[00:14:56.055 --> 00:15:02.880]  In case you're wondering, the new title for Star Wars Episode VII was just released, and it's going to be called The Force Awakens.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.380]  Interesting title.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.321]  We'll see if that still plays out.
[00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:13.262]  In the past, there have been title changes at the last minute.
[00:15:13.362 --> 00:15:15.902]  Return of the Jedi was going to be called Revenge of the Jedi.
[00:15:16.323 --> 00:15:17.623]  And now we all hope that J.J.
[00:15:17.743 --> 00:15:20.224]  Abrams can succeed where the prequel failed.
[00:15:20.624 --> 00:15:26.865]  And that's to create a movie with credible acting and not rely on cartoon characters to appeal to that elusive two-to-six-year-old demographic.
[00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:27.986]  What's this?
[00:15:28.366 --> 00:15:28.806]  A local.
[00:15:29.686 --> 00:15:35.428]  But where the prequel did go right is by illustrating the false flag operation and the Hegelian dialectic.
[00:15:36.047 --> 00:15:48.571]  In order to ensure the security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the First Galactic Empire!
[00:15:48.971 --> 00:15:53.693]  For a safe and secure society!
[00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:05.555]  Emperor Palpatine, or the Emperors he is referred to by the time he was thrown down a reactor shaft, started off as a mild-mannered senator from Naboo.
[00:16:06.075 --> 00:16:11.699]  He then hatched a multi-decade plan using many different alien races as his useful ID10Ts.
[00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:15.161]  That's idiots for all you out there who don't speak nerd.
[00:16:15.701 --> 00:16:17.623]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[00:16:18.483 --> 00:16:19.744]  These aren't the droids we're looking for.
[00:16:20.697 --> 00:16:26.259]  He secretly initiates the creation of two armies, manages to get elected Chancellor under the guise of a humanitarian crisis.
[00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:37.342]  My first act with this new authority, I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.
[00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:51.595]  Then starts a war where both sides of the conflict have unlimited budgets to fight a war on hundreds of battlefronts, thereby draining the resources of all sides, and doing this under the nose of the Jedi, who just can't seem to realize that the guy walking and talking with them is a Sith Lord.
[00:16:53.176 --> 00:16:56.117]  The dark side clouds everything.
[00:16:57.398 --> 00:17:00.419]  The Emperor even manages to off all of his commanders.
[00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:05.591]  He will take care of you.
[00:17:05.611 --> 00:17:06.652]  Lord Sidious promised us peace.
[00:17:06.672 --> 00:17:07.313]  He only wants...
[00:17:22.554 --> 00:17:25.656]  Look up the Knight of the Long Knives if you want a historical example for that one.
[00:17:26.276 --> 00:17:31.599]  Fast forward 18 years, the Supreme Chancellor disbands his dysfunctional government in favor of a dictatorship.
[00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:35.901]  I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the Council permanently.
[00:17:36.461 --> 00:17:42.545]  Thus completing a galaxy-wide false flag which started off as a seemingly small planetary trade blockade on his home planet.
[00:17:43.825 --> 00:17:49.929]  So by playing off all sides against each other and creating a crisis, which is the Confederacy with a giant drone army,
[00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:56.374]  He is able to pull off the Hegelian dialectic by providing his own convenient clone army which he started creating years ago.
[00:17:57.094 --> 00:18:00.097]  Emperor Palpatine is the perfect technocrat dictator.
[00:18:01.378 --> 00:18:03.179]  It's treason then.
[00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:15.488]  So while there remains to be seen out there what will be seen in Episode 7, whether it's Chrome Stormtroopers, The Inquisitor, or Chewbacca with a bionic hand, it will be interesting to see if J.J.
[00:18:15.568 --> 00:18:20.089]  Abrams can harness the archetypes and historical references that George Lucas used all so well.
[00:18:20.409 --> 00:18:26.051]  The fact that he is now under the Disney umbrella probably means anything meaningful won't be seen in this film.
[00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:28.732]  There'll be a lot of flash and a lot of lens flares.
[00:18:28.912 --> 00:18:30.212]  That I can almost assure you.
[00:18:31.132 --> 00:18:33.233]  I find your lack of faith disturbing.
[00:18:34.858 --> 00:18:40.082]  But I do have a new hope that he will do a better job than George Lucas in creating a stylistic masterpiece.
[00:18:40.943 --> 00:18:49.991]  And if you would like a complete history of false flags, pick up a copy of Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism, at the InfoWars store, or you can watch it free on YouTube.
[00:18:51.032 --> 00:18:57.957]  Please write in the comments below which, in your mind, is the biggest false flag that we've seen since 1977, which is the year Star Wars premiered.
[00:18:59.038 --> 00:19:02.101]  This has been Rob Due with InfoWars.com, and may the Force be with you!
[00:19:23.777 --> 00:19:27.579]  The Force is strong with you.
[00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:32.841]  A powerful Sith you will become.
[00:19:34.262 --> 00:19:41.725]  Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth Vader.
[00:19:47.898 --> 00:19:48.699]  Hi, I'm Dr. Group.
[00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:55.202]  Today, I'm proud and excited to announce a new product to the InfoWars Life product line.
[00:19:55.643 --> 00:20:01.646]  Introducing the first proprietary oxygen-based intestinal cleanser, OxyPowder.
[00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:07.190]  Backed by real FDA-approved Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials.
[00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:11.793]  People are suffering from all kinds of digestive issues these days.
[00:20:12.234 --> 00:20:21.542]  All the toxins from the air, the food, the water, everything that you're exposed to on a daily basis, ultimately ends up in the gut or affects the gut.
[00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:24.364]  My main focus was to come up with a remedy for this.
[00:20:24.464 --> 00:20:32.010]  Something that's safe and effective that anyone can take on a regular basis to keep their intestinal lining clean.
[00:20:32.751 --> 00:20:41.618]  You have over 30 feet of intestinal lining that can be compacted, that can be toxic, that can be full of parasites, fungus, bacteria.
[00:20:42.218 --> 00:20:45.381]  What are you doing to keep that clean and flushed out?
[00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:55.168]  My recommendation is to clean your intestines at least two to three times a week to prevent the toxic buildup from going into your bloodstream.
[00:20:55.448 --> 00:21:02.194]  You owe it to yourself to take your health into your own hands and start cleansing your body today with Oxy-Powder.

[00:21:11.152 --> 00:21:14.393]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:21:14.493 --> 00:21:16.734]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:21:16.914 --> 00:21:25.197]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:21:25.497 --> 00:21:33.460]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:41.612]  A super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:49.464]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:21:49.864 --> 00:21:55.966]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:22:21.296 --> 00:22:26.281]  Well today we're going to be speaking with Ivan Estevez of the Help Get the F Out campaign.
[00:22:26.421 --> 00:22:35.910]  It's a PSA that they're going to be airing starting in Dallas and hopefully going nationwide with this campaign to educate the public about getting fluoride out of the water.
[00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:41.395]  They'll be starting in Dallas there because the people in Dallas have the opportunity to vote
[00:22:41.795 --> 00:22:43.356]  To take the fluoride out of their water.
[00:22:43.376 --> 00:22:44.677]  That's coming up in January.
[00:22:45.277 --> 00:22:49.940]  Now, Estevez, along with Dr. Conant, helped envision and produce this campaign.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.202]  It features actor Ed Begley Jr.
[00:22:52.642 --> 00:22:53.863]  in this first PSA.
[00:22:54.163 --> 00:22:58.726]  They give you all sorts of perks for helping support this Indiegogo campaign.
[00:22:59.166 --> 00:23:08.072]  And they hope to air this PSA during primetime network TV shows to really educate the public and force
[00:23:08.852 --> 00:23:14.115]  Awareness forced their support for getting this toxic substance out of the water supply.
[00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:17.056]  It doesn't even make any sense why it's there in the first place.
[00:23:17.817 --> 00:23:18.957]  Ivan, welcome to the show.
[00:23:19.117 --> 00:23:23.620]  So please tell us a little bit about the Indiegogo campaign, Help Get the F Out.
[00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:26.621]  Well, thanks for having me on the show here.
[00:23:27.122 --> 00:23:27.922]  It's great to be here.
[00:23:28.963 --> 00:23:35.326]  Yes, the Help Get the F Out campaign is basically a campaign that we are doing to raise money
[00:23:35.987 --> 00:23:46.355]  To be able to buy primetime airtime on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and air a public service announcement that we created with Ed Begley Jr.
[00:23:47.356 --> 00:24:02.388]  It's about fluoride and it basically hits the bullet points on what fluoride actually does to people and gives them a plan of action to get together with their local fluoride awareness group and their city to help them work together with the city council and get the fluoride out of the water.
[00:24:02.448 --> 00:24:02.568]  So.
[00:24:03.038 --> 00:24:14.328]  The campaign is basically an Indiegogo campaign to raise the money to actually buy the airtime to air the PSA on television to create mass awareness about what fluoride is doing to people.
[00:24:14.348 --> 00:24:16.370]  And that's what the campaign is to do.
[00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:29.382]  And we want to do it first in Dallas, because Dallas is right on the fence in terms of having a victory and having a lot of people sign petitions and come down to city council right before the vote in mid-January could have a major impact.
[00:24:30.015 --> 00:24:33.278]  on pushing Dallas towards not renewing that contract.
[00:24:33.318 --> 00:24:43.785]  So if we can get a victory in Dallas, that'll create a tidal wave or a domino effect, if you will, for other cities, as many cities are in the fight now to get fluoride out of the water.
[00:24:43.825 --> 00:24:58.236]  So basically, after the Dallas campaign, the idea is to run the campaign in other cities, Austin, Houston, San Francisco, LA, New York, Atlanta, Raleigh-Durham, all the big cities that have big push to get fluoride out of the water so we can
[00:24:58.746 --> 00:25:10.202]  Boost the awareness in those cities and get a higher turnout for the people that actually show up at the city council members and so forth to help get it out of the city level.
[00:25:10.222 --> 00:25:11.284]  Because that's where it takes place.
[00:25:11.727 --> 00:25:12.487]  Right, exactly.
[00:25:12.528 --> 00:25:17.670]  It is all about raising awareness and getting people to actually show up to these city council meetings.
[00:25:17.771 --> 00:25:20.192]  Hijacking the airwaves is a big part of that.
[00:25:20.572 --> 00:25:29.978]  I know here when we went to the Austin City Council, when they were trying to make their decision to renew their contract to put fluoride in the water, a lot of people showed up.
[00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:34.300]  We did have one city council member that actually feigned a little bit of interest.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.401]  The mayor actually
[00:25:36.041 --> 00:25:41.305]  Flipped us off secretively, you know, he thought it was kind of sly with his little giving us the finger.
[00:25:41.405 --> 00:25:46.890]  But you know, I think it was just that there was wasn't a lot of awareness until all of these people just showed up.
[00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.733]  There were actually two guys out there doing a fluoride hunger strike.
[00:25:51.473 --> 00:25:55.657]  They did that for about three weeks to try and raise awareness for this fluoride.
[00:25:56.217 --> 00:25:57.859]  But let's go ahead and take a look at the PSA.
[00:25:58.817 --> 00:25:59.938]  Hi, I'm Ed Begley Jr.
[00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:04.122]  You know, back in the 50s, doctors on television told us cigarettes were cool, fun, and harmless.
[00:26:04.703 --> 00:26:07.846]  They also told us adding fluoride to our water is good for our teeth.
[00:26:08.526 --> 00:26:12.070]  But did you know 41% of American children now have dental fluorosis?
[00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.712]  You want your children's teeth to look like this?
[00:26:15.072 --> 00:26:15.793]  You think that's bad?
[00:26:16.013 --> 00:26:17.194]  How about your child's brain?
[00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:22.519]  Well, scientists at Harvard University published that fluoride prevents proper brain development and lowers IQ.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:34.302]  So if people have to wear hazmat suits to handle this stuff because it's so corrosive it eats through concrete, and you're warned to call poison control if you swallow your toothpaste, then why is it still added to the water we drink, cook, and shower with?
[00:26:34.802 --> 00:26:42.003]  The good news is countries like Israel and cities like Portland, Wichita, and Davis, California have rejected fluoridation, and we can too.
[00:26:42.263 --> 00:26:43.184]  So here's what you want to do.
[00:26:43.524 --> 00:26:46.424]  First, get all the facts at FluorideAlert.org.
[00:26:46.684 --> 00:26:51.145]  Second, go to FluorideProtection.org for everything you need to protect your family from fluoride.
[00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:57.468]  Then work with your city's Fluoride Awareness Group to get this poison out of your community's water.
[00:26:58.969 --> 00:27:01.310]  So obviously that's a very powerful PSA.
[00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.592]  So what show time are people going to be seeing this?
[00:27:04.632 --> 00:27:08.134]  Like during Dr. Oz or what's the audience that's going to be viewing this?
[00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:09.575]  Really powerful PSA.
[00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:16.298]  Yeah, ideally, you know, we'd like to air it on, like I said, on shows like Dr. Oz, Ellen,
[00:27:18.452 --> 00:27:19.573]  I'm trying to think of other ones.
[00:27:20.473 --> 00:27:29.739]  Basically, I would like to go to Ellen, for example, if we raise, you know, X amount of dollars for this, and I know she's behind the same, you know, she wants to get swore out of the water, too.
[00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:35.783]  So, I would like to go to her and say, hey, will you match the funds that we actually raised for this PSA?
[00:27:35.883 --> 00:27:42.327]  And, you know, so we can air it more times during your show, because I know you care about your viewers, and, you know, she would love to see her viewers know about this.
[00:27:43.739 --> 00:27:59.794]  Yeah, it's kind of raising awareness that you can get that support of the public to kind of take the stigma away from fluoride because everyone, you know, oh well it's in our toothpaste, the dentists have been telling us for 50 years it's safe.
[00:28:00.514 --> 00:28:03.357]  So it's kind of just getting away from that misinformation.
[00:28:03.897 --> 00:28:08.622]  How did you get in touch with Ed Begley Jr., the actor there in the PSA?
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:18.482]  Actually, you know, Paul Conant and I and Michael Conant, his son, we were... I was trying to produce a multi-part series about fluoride.
[00:28:18.642 --> 00:28:23.364]  I wanted to do about 20 different segments, five minutes apiece, and put them on public television.
[00:28:24.404 --> 00:28:29.686]  And it just... The funding wasn't there, but I knew I wanted to do something with fluoride and get a message out there.
[00:28:30.406 --> 00:28:38.708]  And so we reduced it down to a public service announcement, and we had a couple actors, you know, to kind of choose from, Dr. Conant from
[00:28:39.249 --> 00:28:50.336]  The Fluoride Action Network had a contact with, Martin Sheen was one, Ed Asner was another, Ed Begley was another, and I think Bill Mayer was one other.
[00:28:50.476 --> 00:28:51.697]  So I chose Ed Begley.
[00:28:51.957 --> 00:28:53.058]  I've been a fan of Ed Begley.
[00:28:53.138 --> 00:28:54.979]  I know he really cares about the environment.
[00:28:55.759 --> 00:28:58.401]  And so I just figured he'd be the one to do this with.
[00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:04.425]  And so that's how, you know, it came from a connection with Dr. Paul Connett from the Fluoride Action Network and FluorideAlert.org.
[00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:07.146]  So fortunately, Ed was very pleased to do it.
[00:29:09.434 --> 00:29:11.035]  We've actually got it done, so here we are.
[00:29:11.956 --> 00:29:18.220]  Yeah, well you could tell he was pretty passionate about it, not just reading his cue cards like a good actor should.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.082]  You could tell he was really, there was some passion behind his words there.
[00:29:22.703 --> 00:29:30.668]  You also direct people to some other great resources there in the commercial, fluorideprotection.org, where you kind of
[00:29:31.448 --> 00:29:36.951]  Let people know about some other things that they can use to help detoxify their body from fluoride.
[00:29:37.031 --> 00:29:53.538]  Obviously, our Fluoride Shield is featured right there, using it as one of the products to kind of educate the public on just different things that they can eat, natural things, and things that their body might not be, you know, might be deficient on to help them, you know, counteract the effects of fluoride.
[00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:54.879]  Absolutely.
[00:29:55.379 --> 00:29:58.861]  So what are some of the things that you're talking about there?
[00:29:59.722 --> 00:30:08.788]  You know, at the last minute, I had written a script for this PSA, and I was like, you know what, we got to give something to the people to be able to protect themselves.
[00:30:09.629 --> 00:30:25.579]  In the meantime, if the government still delays on getting this stuff out of the water, and if they do delay, but we've notified the people on what they can use naturally to actually detoxify their bodies from fluoride and protect it from ongoing exposure, then we've kind of fixed the problem in a way.
[00:30:26.098 --> 00:30:27.019]  Or at least halfway.
[00:30:27.099 --> 00:30:38.484]  And my take on that was, you know, if we get 10 million people who find out about fluoride and start protecting themselves from it, and they get it out of their body, well, we know that that means their pineal glands will start functioning.
[00:30:38.865 --> 00:30:39.365]  Right.
[00:30:39.665 --> 00:30:47.809]  And if that's our connection to the spiritual realm and spiritual, you know, who we really are and our true essence, then we need to be connected to that.
[00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:52.111]  So, we know that fluoride calcifies that gland and prevents it from working.
[00:30:52.151 --> 00:30:53.432]  And I liken that to a
[00:30:54.108 --> 00:30:55.429]  Rabbit ears on the television.
[00:30:55.469 --> 00:31:00.332]  I mean, we used to have rabbit ears on television, and when the rabbit ears were on the television, we got the signal.
[00:31:00.352 --> 00:31:02.914]  We could see the picture and watch the movie on television.
[00:31:03.374 --> 00:31:09.678]  But if the rabbit ears fell off the television, the signal didn't come in, and all we got was fuzz on the television, and we couldn't see the signal.
[00:31:09.758 --> 00:31:11.219]  It's the same thing with our pineal gland.
[00:31:11.319 --> 00:31:21.245]  That's the master gland in our brain that gives us, as spiritual beings, the ability to connect with that realm and still be in the physical realm and in the human body.
[00:31:21.829 --> 00:31:30.032]  So, again, if it's calcified and it's not working, then we're not nearly what our potential is.
[00:31:30.052 --> 00:31:33.433]  We're just mere shadows of it, really.
[00:31:33.994 --> 00:31:47.219]  So, my philosophy is if we can teach people how to protect themselves from fluoride, whether the government takes it out of the water or not, at least people can be protected and basically have their DNA protected, have their bodies protected, and that just means less cancer, less degenerative
[00:31:48.007 --> 00:31:48.608]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:32:09.924 --> 00:32:11.405]  If you get near it, you're going to corrode.
[00:32:11.446 --> 00:32:12.907]  So that's what it does to the human body.
[00:32:12.947 --> 00:32:14.128]  So we need to teach people that.
[00:32:14.148 --> 00:32:14.488]  Right.
[00:32:14.528 --> 00:32:16.250]  You know, we'd have a different society.
[00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:17.090]  Absolutely.
[00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:23.956]  Very powerful there with the hazmat suit and really incredible metaphor there with the rabbit ears and the television because that's exactly it.
[00:32:23.996 --> 00:32:30.141]  It's kind of scrambling the signal and we've got to decalcify our pineal gland to be able to get
[00:32:30.822 --> 00:32:30.982]  Yes.
[00:32:52.072 --> 00:32:54.314]  What do you want to tell the people now to get them involved?
[00:32:54.634 --> 00:33:00.458]  Obviously, when you run these campaigns, there's a little bit of a kickback for people who might help you donate to the project.
[00:33:00.898 --> 00:33:03.160]  But what do you really want to let our audience know?
[00:33:04.101 --> 00:33:08.764]  Well, you know, we've got a bunch of, we call them perks on the Indiegogo campaign.
[00:33:08.784 --> 00:33:16.009]  Those are basically giveaways or incentives or gifts in exchange for your cooperation and your collaboration in helping us do this campaign.
[00:33:17.141 --> 00:33:18.962]  And there are things that really benefit you.
[00:33:19.002 --> 00:33:22.124]  It's not like we're sending you a picture of something that really doesn't make any difference.
[00:33:22.144 --> 00:33:23.825]  These are things that will make a difference in your life.
[00:33:23.845 --> 00:33:27.447]  These are all-natural fluoride-free toothpastes.
[00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:34.170]  There are detoxification protocols and products from Dr. Edward Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:37.812]  He donated to the campaign that will completely clean people out.
[00:33:38.853 --> 00:33:46.117]  We've got superfoods on there that basically are loaded with vitamins and nutrients that our normal food does not have.
[00:33:46.741 --> 00:33:54.764]  And those are not vitamins and nutrients and minerals that our body needs to actually protect us from fluoride exposure and exposure to other chemicals and metals.
[00:33:55.384 --> 00:34:07.489]  So all the giveaways that we're doing on the campaign in exchange for people's sponsorship are things that are only going to benefit them and help their health.
[00:34:08.229 --> 00:34:14.872]  And if they want to give away fluoride toothpaste to their friends, we've got what we call Ambassador Packs, which are, you know, a pack of like five different
[00:34:15.726 --> 00:34:16.606]  We're good to go.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.905]  We're offering Fluoride Shield 2 as well.
[00:34:47.965 --> 00:34:52.249]  It's basically the first line of defense.
[00:34:52.329 --> 00:34:54.971]  It's got everything you need to detoxify your body in there.
[00:34:55.052 --> 00:35:01.758]  So for a donation, we'll send you a bottle of Fluoride Shield and some fluoride-free toothpaste and you're on your way.
[00:35:03.257 --> 00:35:04.478]  Yeah, it is really incredible.
[00:35:04.538 --> 00:35:06.080]  So either way, you're getting something out of it.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:12.306]  And at the very least, you're helping to raise awareness, educate the public about the dangers of fluoride.
[00:35:12.786 --> 00:35:17.831]  And we might get that big win of actually getting fluoride out of our water.
[00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:19.893]  Also pretty interesting to note that it
[00:35:20.373 --> 00:35:28.721]  I'm not sure if it's the particular fluoride-free toothpaste that you were using or giving away with this Indiegogo campaign, but it's kind of a coalition of these groups.
[00:35:29.261 --> 00:35:34.987]  There was another fluoride-free toothpaste maker that was donated more than a million dollars to try and get
[00:35:35.547 --> 00:35:37.068]  Labeling for GMOs.
[00:35:37.428 --> 00:35:41.590]  So there really is just this coalition of people who really care.
[00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:55.156]  People are really starting to band together and put their money for these good causes to fight the globalists, fight these people who would rather not educate themselves on the dangers of fluoride and just say, well, we've always been putting fluoride in the water.
[00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:56.157]  What's the big deal?
[00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:56.997]  What's the problem?
[00:35:57.557 --> 00:35:58.698]  Maybe Ed Bentley Jr.
[00:35:58.738 --> 00:36:03.380]  in a hazmat suit will be enough to let people know that this is really dangerous.
[00:36:04.252 --> 00:36:04.812]  Absolutely.
[00:36:05.133 --> 00:36:11.056]  Some people say, well, why do I want to donate toward a campaign for Dallas or, you know, some other city and I don't live there.
[00:36:11.537 --> 00:36:15.999]  Well, the truth is we're all connected and what you do for your fellow man is only going to come back to you.
[00:36:16.099 --> 00:36:25.545]  And if you help get the fluoride out of water in one city, especially Dallas, that's just going to create a domino effect to help get it out of your city's water.
[00:36:25.645 --> 00:36:31.589]  So, you know, if you can contribute to this campaign, it's only going to come back to all to you in the long run.
[00:36:31.629 --> 00:36:31.749]  So.
[00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:38.452]  Please do what you can to contribute and we'll make sure we get all the right perks out there to you to make it all worthwhile and help you.
[00:36:39.293 --> 00:36:39.833]  Absolutely.
[00:36:40.353 --> 00:36:55.642]  Well, Ivan Estevez of the Help Get the F Out campaign to end water fluoridation, thank you so much for joining us on the show tonight and we will definitely do everything we can here at InfoWars to support this campaign and educate the public.
[00:36:56.516 --> 00:37:01.877]  Well, thank you so much for doing what you guys can to get this message out there and create a victory for all of us.
[00:37:02.337 --> 00:37:02.997]  Thank you very much.
[00:37:03.457 --> 00:37:04.098]  Well, there you go.
[00:37:04.138 --> 00:37:12.359]  You can go to the Indiegogo campaign, show your support, help them raise funds so that they can air this PSA during primetime television shows.
[00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:16.920]  Obviously, they want to start with Dallas, but that will just be the one major city.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.721]  From there, it can fan out, become a national, if not global, movement.
[00:37:21.001 --> 00:37:25.105]  To help get the fluoride out of the water, help get the F out.
[00:37:25.585 --> 00:37:30.509]  And as always, we appreciate your support by becoming a Prison Planet TV subscriber.

[00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:56.930]  Central.
[00:38:02.605 --> 00:38:03.786]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:38:03.966 --> 00:38:06.549]  Today I'd like to talk about the War on Women.
[00:38:07.189 --> 00:38:11.494]  You've experienced and heard about the benefits of super male vitality.
[00:38:12.014 --> 00:38:14.496]  Now, the new formula has arrived.
[00:38:14.877 --> 00:38:18.761]  Introducing the new super female vitality.
[00:38:19.061 --> 00:38:27.129]  I have specifically designed this formula to help the body naturally regulate itself without the use of artificial hormones.
[00:38:27.509 --> 00:38:27.909]  We're good to go.
[00:38:45.726 --> 00:38:55.017]  Now, both the man and the woman can have the revitalization in their own bodies with super male vitality and super female vitality.
[00:38:55.257 --> 00:39:01.304]  Secure your super female vitality today from our limited stock at infowarslife.com.
[00:39:08.888 --> 00:39:12.311]  And welcome back to this Friday edition of Infowars Nightly News.
[00:39:12.652 --> 00:39:25.644]  This is a special report, a special investigation to look into the supposed death back on May 2nd, 2011 of Osama bin Laden, taken out by the Navy SEALs.
[00:39:26.325 --> 00:39:29.007]  Now we're going to try to go through this report as quickly as possible.
[00:39:29.878 --> 00:39:38.742]  But the amount of evidence proving that the official story is a contrivance, a fairy tale, is mountainous.
[00:39:38.762 --> 00:39:59.470]  We're going to move through it quickly here today from A to Z. First off, we're covering this obviously again because Robert O'Neill, a Navy SEAL veteran of 15 years, came out on Fox News yesterday and with the Washington Post as well and said that he indeed took out Osama bin Laden.
[00:40:00.455 --> 00:40:02.116]  Well, here's the problem.
[00:40:03.256 --> 00:40:09.259]  First off, remember private Jessica Lynch who supposedly took out an Iraqi column?
[00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:11.400]  Turned out she was hiding in the back of the vehicle.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.461]  It was all a Pentagon production.
[00:40:14.454 --> 00:40:16.176]  To try to recruit women into the military.
[00:40:16.576 --> 00:40:21.241]  A bunch of members of her team started speaking out, started getting executed and dying in the U.S.
[00:40:21.301 --> 00:40:21.962]  and overseas.
[00:40:22.302 --> 00:40:28.248]  And she came out and said it was a fraud, a recruiting tactic that I was ordered to be part of in PSYOPs.
[00:40:28.788 --> 00:40:35.335]  Jerry Bruckheimer got involved in advising the production of it in the so-called rescue days after the Iraqis had pulled out.
[00:40:35.615 --> 00:40:36.196]  Pat Tillman.
[00:40:37.355 --> 00:40:37.655]  Wouldn't
[00:40:56.522 --> 00:40:57.442]  History of this.
[00:40:57.562 --> 00:41:00.704]  Number two, Obama just was defeated in a big election.
[00:41:01.184 --> 00:41:03.765]  He needs to remind us that he took out Osama Bin Laden.
[00:41:04.185 --> 00:41:07.506]  So that's one reason this guy pops up right on time.
[00:41:07.906 --> 00:41:10.107]  Now, I'm not putting down Robert O'Neill.
[00:41:11.668 --> 00:41:14.709]  But they know we trust Navy SEALs a lot more than Obama.
[00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:16.089]  Here's another problem.
[00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:20.271]  Two other Navy SEALs, supposedly part of the raid, who've written books and gone public.
[00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.309]  That's
[00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:52.800]  That their Navy SEAL sons who had died, they believed, were basically killed in that helicopter explosion to cover up the fact that it was really a Osama Bin Laden body double who was actually working for the CIA that was taken out.
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:58.222]  And we're going to show a document cam here and then Rob is going to go over all these articles for everybody here in a moment.
[00:41:59.543 --> 00:42:05.049]  Over a hundred articles, most of them mainstream, showing that there was nobody on the ship.
[00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:06.290]  They didn't dump him in the ocean.
[00:42:06.611 --> 00:42:07.612]  They tried to cover it up.
[00:42:07.732 --> 00:42:08.673]  It goes on and on.
[00:42:08.913 --> 00:42:13.758]  There wasn't a real Situation Room live feed going on.
[00:42:14.359 --> 00:42:19.524]  So that's the most frustrating part of our job, is that we do the research day after day.
[00:42:19.584 --> 00:42:21.646]  We came out day one and showed the anomalies.
[00:42:22.287 --> 00:42:25.948]  We predicted in 2002 that he'd already been killed with inside sources.
[00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:30.110]  They would later roll his body out at a politically expedient point.
[00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:42.535]  So we are deep researchers with major whistleblowers, like Dr. Steve Pchenik, former head of Pentagon PSYOPs, exposing the fact that this would be rolled out at a later date.
[00:42:42.715 --> 00:42:43.475]  Got that right here.
[00:42:43.555 --> 00:42:47.477]  So we're going to break it all down here for you, and you can check all of these sources
[00:42:48.308 --> 00:43:03.456]  But the reason this is being brought out now is to try to get people recruited into the Navy that's having big problems and PR problems, but most importantly as a political victory after the election to remind people that Obama supposedly took out Osama.
[00:43:03.976 --> 00:43:07.118]  So the whole thing is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.
[00:43:07.178 --> 00:43:11.480]  But remember, years after I interviewed the families, talked to Navy SEALs in person,
[00:43:13.396 --> 00:43:30.742]  It's come out in the news exactly what our sources told us, that the majority of the families believe they blew up that helicopter months after they supposedly took out Bin Laden to shut up the SEALs that were talking about the fact that they showed up at the house, there was no security there, and it was basically a body double that was set up.
[00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:36.204]  And it's later come out that the CIA was casing the joint using an inoculation program as the cover.
[00:43:36.644 --> 00:43:38.125]  So, nothing about this.
[00:43:39.045 --> 00:43:40.146]  Has turned out to be true.
[00:43:40.466 --> 00:43:43.989]  Sy Hersh, Pulitzer Prize winner, has come out and said it's 100% false.
[00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:49.153]  Rob Dew, I want you to walk through some of this and then I'll get into some of the other angles.
[00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:56.399]  But again, it's hard to tackle a mountain of evidence like this showing that the official story is a fraud.
[00:43:56.439 --> 00:44:01.003]  But I think the biggest issue is all the Navy SEALs on his team are saying different things.
[00:44:01.023 --> 00:44:01.523]  They can't agree.
[00:44:01.784 --> 00:44:02.464]  And that's the thing.
[00:44:02.744 --> 00:44:05.687]  When you have a bunch of people telling a lie, they can't figure out what the truth is.
[00:44:05.947 --> 00:44:09.068]  You're just going to say different things and then say, no, you're lying, you're lying.
[00:44:09.088 --> 00:44:13.570]  You've got a couple books written, SEAL target Geronimo and No Easy Day.
[00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:14.931]  Don't agree with each other at all.
[00:44:14.951 --> 00:44:15.971]  And these are published books.
[00:44:16.011 --> 00:44:19.033]  And they're supposedly interviews with the SEALs, interviews with the teams.
[00:44:19.053 --> 00:44:28.297]  One of them is even written by one of the SEALs on the raid, who doesn't agree with Rob O'Neill about who was in there first and who actually got the shot off that killed bin Laden.
[00:44:28.837 --> 00:44:32.318]  Now, first thing, here we did back in 2011 in May.
[00:44:32.538 --> 00:44:36.380]  Paul Joseph Watson, 10 facts that prove the Bin Laden fable is a contrived hoax.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.620]  There you go right there.
[00:44:38.501 --> 00:44:42.142]  Before that, we published the fake Situation Room photos, which we're going to put up on screen.
[00:44:42.162 --> 00:44:43.002]  We said they were fake.
[00:44:43.042 --> 00:44:44.643]  They admitted a week later they were fake.
[00:44:44.683 --> 00:44:45.083]  Exactly.
[00:44:45.103 --> 00:44:47.484]  We brought up the 10 facts that have now been brought out in Congress.
[00:44:48.104 --> 00:44:48.565]  Exactly.
[00:44:48.605 --> 00:44:55.674]  And then you have Obama coming out on a 60 Minutes interview and saying, we didn't even know if it was the Prince of Dubai in this compound.
[00:44:55.694 --> 00:44:56.516]  We weren't even sure.
[00:44:57.116 --> 00:44:59.600]  So they didn't even have the correct intelligence.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.884]  And then later you have the administration won't release bin Laden records.
[00:45:02.944 --> 00:45:05.468]  And then AP did a Freedom of Information Act request.
[00:45:05.808 --> 00:45:06.629]  And here they are from March 15, 2012.
[00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:14.137]  The Pentagon told the AP this month it could not locate any photographs or video taken during the raid or showing Bin Laden's body.
[00:45:14.537 --> 00:45:20.023]  It also could not find any images of Bin Laden's body on the Navy aircraft carrier where the al-Qaeda leader's body was taken.
[00:45:20.363 --> 00:45:24.728]  The Pentagon said it could not find any death certificate, autopsy report, DNA identification test.
[00:45:24.748 --> 00:45:25.508]  And this is a year!
[00:45:26.269 --> 00:45:27.730]  They have plenty of time to fabricate this.
[00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.493]  After the people on the ship by the hundreds said, well there was no body, no funeral.
[00:45:31.533 --> 00:45:33.615]  They claimed a funeral and then everyone had seen it.
[00:45:33.995 --> 00:45:36.678]  They're on, and then they start court-martialing them to shut them up.
[00:45:36.698 --> 00:45:36.998]  Exactly.
[00:45:37.058 --> 00:45:40.000]  And it's not like they didn't have any DNA material of Osama bin Laden.
[00:45:40.341 --> 00:45:44.044]  He'd been visiting a hospital in the months before 9-11.
[00:45:44.084 --> 00:45:45.285]  This came out of Le Figaro.
[00:45:45.325 --> 00:45:53.171]  Two months before September 11th, Osama bin Laden flew to Dubai for 10 days of treatment in an American hospital where he's visited by the local CIA agent.
[00:45:53.271 --> 00:45:55.592]  And that's one of the biggest publications in France.
[00:45:55.613 --> 00:45:55.913]  Figaro.
[00:45:55.973 --> 00:45:56.713]  This is in the Guardian.
[00:45:56.733 --> 00:45:57.514]  In the Guardian, yeah.
[00:45:57.954 --> 00:46:06.980]  And then we have a transcript from a 2002 interview with you and Steve Pichinik where he's talking about he was already dead, that he had a kidney problem, and that wasn't even well known.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:12.243]  And then President Musharraf said they destroyed his dialysis machines in the caves of Afghanistan.
[00:46:12.283 --> 00:46:17.747]  And I've had the former head of Pakistani intelligence that ran the CIA operations against the Russians on, Hamid Gul,
[00:46:18.447 --> 00:46:19.828]  Concurring with our analysis.
[00:46:20.128 --> 00:46:21.189]  And then you go to the ship.
[00:46:21.609 --> 00:46:21.889]  Leaked.
[00:46:21.969 --> 00:46:23.290]  Bin Laden not buried at sea.
[00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:25.511]  Body moved on CIA plane to the U.S.
[00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:26.732]  That's not what they told us first.
[00:46:26.752 --> 00:46:28.033]  They said we buried him at sea.
[00:46:28.153 --> 00:46:29.654]  And then you go to the aircraft carrier.
[00:46:29.754 --> 00:46:29.994]  Leaked.
[00:46:30.054 --> 00:46:31.335]  Bin Laden not buried at sea.
[00:46:31.375 --> 00:46:33.256]  Body moved on CIA plane to U.S.
[00:46:33.276 --> 00:46:35.117]  That's directly opposite of what they said.
[00:46:35.157 --> 00:46:35.977]  They buried him at sea.
[00:46:36.017 --> 00:46:36.618]  They washed him.
[00:46:36.658 --> 00:46:39.499]  They did it all according to Muslim tradition, which doesn't exist.
[00:46:39.539 --> 00:46:40.680]  There are no burials at sea.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:46.544]  And Stratford, that's basically a CIA propaganda outfit here in Austin, one of the most prominent, even going to Bilderberg,
[00:46:47.384 --> 00:46:52.906]  They came out, and when the emails got leaked, they were saying, say that we brought him to the U.S.
[00:46:53.146 --> 00:46:54.466]  to counter Alex Jones.
[00:46:54.506 --> 00:46:55.027]  There you go.
[00:46:55.427 --> 00:47:04.430]  And then no sailors saw Bin Laden's body buried at sea, and then they started discharging naval officers from that vessel, saying they were for drug use and distribution.
[00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.751]  So, they're trying to cover their butts in every situation.
[00:47:08.911 --> 00:47:10.191]  Court-martials ever for a ship.
[00:47:10.292 --> 00:47:10.812]  There you go.
[00:47:11.172 --> 00:47:16.174]  So Bin Laden was buried at sea from the Carl Vinson in May after the Al-Qaeda leader was killed in a raid by U.S.
[00:47:16.214 --> 00:47:18.254]  Navy SEALs on his Pakistan hideout.
[00:47:18.274 --> 00:47:19.575]  The ship normally has 5,000 sailors.
[00:47:19.635 --> 00:47:23.076]  As I said, it was unknown if any of the sailors faced disciplinary punishment.
[00:47:23.096 --> 00:47:33.380]  So again, we've got Reuters here, but then we've got them later in the Associated Press saying a totally different story after Stratford tells them to come out with this new story to quote, counter Alex Jones.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.645]  Again, I'm not bragging when I say we've been following this day one.
[00:47:37.985 --> 00:47:39.508]  It's not like we're Johnny Come Lately's.
[00:47:40.068 --> 00:47:41.591]  I met with the Navy SEAL.
[00:47:42.605 --> 00:47:43.165]  We're good to go.
[00:48:04.884 --> 00:48:10.428]  It's that our sources were correct and it's all been borne out so we know what really happened.
[00:48:10.768 --> 00:48:11.969]  He'd been dead a long time.
[00:48:12.169 --> 00:48:16.232]  They went and set up some guy that looked like him, enough like him, to fool.
[00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:22.619]  And to mess with the minds of the SEALs who aren't sure, then they blow up a helicopter on the ground to confuse things.
[00:48:23.039 --> 00:48:26.301]  A couple months later, they blow up another helicopter with 23 SEALs.
[00:48:26.321 --> 00:48:28.863]  They said no training, no mission preparation.
[00:48:29.083 --> 00:48:30.484]  They'd never been on a mission like this.
[00:48:30.764 --> 00:48:32.225]  They fly them out and they get blown up.
[00:48:32.545 --> 00:48:33.866]  I mean, this is a major setup.
[00:48:33.906 --> 00:48:34.666]  Keep going through it.
[00:48:34.686 --> 00:48:41.471]  The BBC even released a report where they interviewed neighbors, and none of them ever even saw bin Laden in the five years he was supposedly there.
[00:48:41.591 --> 00:48:42.432]  They had never seen him.
[00:48:43.352 --> 00:48:50.416]  And then you have that crazy video that came out of the guy saying that the helicopter landed, then it was taken off, and it blew up, and there were bodies everywhere.
[00:48:50.896 --> 00:48:52.397]  So who knows what happened that night?
[00:48:52.657 --> 00:48:53.658]  We're never going to find out.
[00:48:53.878 --> 00:48:58.560]  That's why you have to create all these fake books and Hollywood productions, you know, with Catherine Bigelow jumping in.
[00:48:58.981 --> 00:49:00.522]  To make it a fiction.
[00:49:00.682 --> 00:49:00.882]  Yeah.
[00:49:01.122 --> 00:49:01.882]  To make it a legend.
[00:49:02.102 --> 00:49:08.546]  But that's what I was told day one by the Seals, is that no, they blew up the helicopter, take it off, and nobody shot at it.
[00:49:10.063 --> 00:49:11.484]  They'd already taken the guys out in the house.
[00:49:11.804 --> 00:49:12.624]  Limited resistance.
[00:49:13.344 --> 00:49:16.026]  And then they really figured out when the second helicopter blew up.
[00:49:16.246 --> 00:49:17.166]  These aren't stupid guys.
[00:49:17.186 --> 00:49:18.467]  This is an operation against us.
[00:49:18.947 --> 00:49:20.148]  We're being useful idiots.
[00:49:20.188 --> 00:49:21.088]  That's what they said.
[00:49:21.168 --> 00:49:22.349]  We're being taken out.
[00:49:22.809 --> 00:49:24.810]  And so now this guy comes out.
[00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:27.771]  He didn't get killed that night when the helicopter blew up.
[00:49:27.991 --> 00:49:31.133]  He didn't get killed when the other SEALs all from this mission got crammed on.
[00:49:31.473 --> 00:49:32.953]  And he's now out here.
[00:49:33.013 --> 00:49:33.814]  Robert O'Neill.
[00:49:34.864 --> 00:49:36.286]  And the other Seals don't agree with him.
[00:49:36.326 --> 00:49:36.986]  So who's lying?
[00:49:37.026 --> 00:49:38.308]  Is it the other Seals?
[00:49:38.768 --> 00:49:40.290]  Or is it Robert O'Neal?
[00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:41.131]  Are they all lying?
[00:49:41.691 --> 00:49:44.774]  They could all be telling part of a tale just to keep it confusing.
[00:49:44.854 --> 00:49:45.775]  It's called a smokescreen.
[00:49:46.056 --> 00:49:47.757]  It's a propaganda technique that they use.
[00:49:48.038 --> 00:49:49.339]  And they throw out a lot of different things.
[00:49:49.379 --> 00:49:50.520]  You're not sure what's going on.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:51.521]  Has he gotten many shots?
[00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:53.163]  And then all the guys that wouldn't play ball?
[00:49:53.583 --> 00:49:53.964]  They're dead.
[00:49:54.687 --> 00:49:55.587]  Dead men tell no tales.
[00:49:55.867 --> 00:49:57.087]  And that's the sad thing about this.
[00:49:57.107 --> 00:49:59.428]  Because you do have these SEALs that go on dangerous missions.
[00:49:59.788 --> 00:50:01.308]  They've got some top secret clearances.
[00:50:01.328 --> 00:50:03.309]  They're out there putting their lives on the line.
[00:50:03.329 --> 00:50:04.569]  They're commando spies.
[00:50:04.669 --> 00:50:04.889]  Right.
[00:50:04.929 --> 00:50:07.410]  And now they're part of this whole fabrication.
[00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.690]  And it's really sad to see that it's still going on after all these years.
[00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.551]  We put out tons of reports about this stuff.
[00:50:12.591 --> 00:50:15.391]  Day one we came out and said it was a hoax.
[00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:18.872]  And then we just kept finding proof after proof.
[00:50:19.392 --> 00:50:20.473]  It just keeps laying itself out.
[00:50:20.493 --> 00:50:22.373]  We said they didn't dump him off the aircraft carrier.
[00:50:22.413 --> 00:50:23.254]  They admit that now.
[00:50:23.314 --> 00:50:23.534]  Yeah.
[00:50:23.614 --> 00:50:26.575]  We said the situation room was fake the day after it.
[00:50:27.136 --> 00:50:28.216]  They said there was no video.
[00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:30.277]  And then it comes out, we don't have anything.
[00:50:30.377 --> 00:50:31.658]  We don't have anything from this guy.
[00:50:31.678 --> 00:50:33.679]  We don't even have photos of his dead body.
[00:50:34.039 --> 00:50:37.160]  And let's not forget, Pat Tillman being used for PR, wouldn't play along.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:37.961]  They murdered him.
[00:50:38.101 --> 00:50:38.301]  Yeah.
[00:50:38.461 --> 00:50:39.221]  Jessica Lynch.
[00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:40.602]  Murdered her team.
[00:50:41.122 --> 00:50:42.022]  Murdered a bunch of the team.
[00:50:42.082 --> 00:50:44.143]  And she went public and said it's all fake, it's all a lie.
[00:50:44.724 --> 00:50:46.204]  For her own safety, she had to do that.
[00:50:46.244 --> 00:50:46.945]  So this is
[00:50:47.885 --> 00:50:50.810]  A major PR move for Obama and for others.
[00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:52.614]  And that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:50:52.754 --> 00:50:57.983]  We'll put some links on PrisonPlanet.tv under this special report after it airs tonight.
[00:50:59.309 --> 00:51:05.031]  Where people can go back to the original special report we shot the day after the report I shot.
[00:51:05.791 --> 00:51:07.732]  I met with this Navy SEAL.
[00:51:07.792 --> 00:51:08.592]  You were freaked out.
[00:51:08.612 --> 00:51:09.892]  I didn't even come to the studio.
[00:51:09.932 --> 00:51:10.953]  You shot this in your car.
[00:51:11.033 --> 00:51:12.433]  I shot it in a car in the parking lot.
[00:51:12.833 --> 00:51:14.894]  And then uploaded it to YouTube on that Saturday.
[00:51:15.274 --> 00:51:19.015]  And then I met with other people and the government all knew this.
[00:51:19.115 --> 00:51:20.836]  They were all just too scared to talk about it.
[00:51:21.676 --> 00:51:21.997]  I don't know.
[00:51:43.257 --> 00:51:53.206]  That they are disposable, and that when they get involved in propaganda and deceptions, that the politicians up above them, just like Benghazi, they killed Ambassador Stevens to get rid of the evidence.
[00:51:53.226 --> 00:51:54.767]  They gave them those MPAD missiles.
[00:51:55.067 --> 00:51:56.669]  And we broke that, and it came out.
[00:51:56.789 --> 00:51:57.970]  You know how I know this is fake, Alex?
[00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:59.931]  My uncle was a Navy SEAL.
[00:51:59.971 --> 00:52:01.813]  He went to Vietnam.
[00:52:02.073 --> 00:52:04.515]  He doesn't talk about anything that happened back in Vietnam.
[00:52:04.615 --> 00:52:05.696]  He was an FBI agent.
[00:52:06.137 --> 00:52:07.398]  He doesn't talk about anything about that.
[00:52:07.698 --> 00:52:09.480]  These guys are coming out here talking about this stuff.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.521]  They don't do that.
[00:52:11.241 --> 00:52:12.021]  Seals don't do that.
[00:52:12.121 --> 00:52:13.522]  Well, that's what Pchenik said.
[00:52:13.662 --> 00:52:13.862]  Yeah.
[00:52:13.962 --> 00:52:16.383]  And he founded Delta Force.
[00:52:17.103 --> 00:52:18.864]  He was a founding member in Delta Force.
[00:52:19.104 --> 00:52:20.945]  I can't get my uncle to say anything about anything.
[00:52:20.985 --> 00:52:22.866]  He just goes, well, there were some crazy times.
[00:52:22.926 --> 00:52:28.148]  That's because they've gone to psyops now against the American people, which is illegal.
[00:52:28.488 --> 00:52:30.809]  And they're using them as pawns, and it makes them targets.
[00:52:31.169 --> 00:52:36.111]  So you've got real missions the Seals are running, and real missions the Army's running, and real missions the Marines are running.
[00:52:36.331 --> 00:52:38.092]  You notice the Army and Marines are not doing this.
[00:52:38.192 --> 00:52:38.372]  Right.
[00:52:38.652 --> 00:52:41.858]  In fact, according to all the people I've talked to, this has made the Seals a laughingstock.
[00:52:42.919 --> 00:52:46.586]  And this guy, Robert O'Neal coming out, I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:52:48.311 --> 00:52:56.077]  He needs to know, he's obviously not stupid, that they don't want him hanging around knowing how this is all baloney.
[00:52:56.358 --> 00:52:56.518]  Right.
[00:52:56.758 --> 00:53:02.803]  Or maybe he is stupid and killed the body double and doesn't know that he really didn't kill Bin Laden.
[00:53:03.003 --> 00:53:03.163]  Right.
[00:53:03.223 --> 00:53:05.385]  But the other SEALs do know it was fake.
[00:53:05.645 --> 00:53:05.845]  Right.
[00:53:06.286 --> 00:53:09.068]  There's enough that knew that they had to kill 20, how was it, 24?
[00:53:10.649 --> 00:53:12.490]  Twenty-three on the helicopter.
[00:53:12.951 --> 00:53:15.893]  And again, I talked to people that talked to the SEALs that were there.
[00:53:15.973 --> 00:53:17.654]  There was no briefings, no nothing.
[00:53:17.674 --> 00:53:18.975]  They just said, on a helicopter.
[00:53:19.215 --> 00:53:20.276]  And they go, we don't ever do this.
[00:53:20.356 --> 00:53:20.837]  What is this?
[00:53:20.977 --> 00:53:22.598]  Yeah, the National Guard helicopters.
[00:53:22.618 --> 00:53:24.880]  Yeah, they were all freaking out when they were flying out there.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:25.520]  They were set up.
[00:53:26.141 --> 00:53:31.264]  And then they were, some of them survived the crash and they were still fighting and no support, no nothing.
[00:53:31.425 --> 00:53:32.806]  It was, we're going to let you guys die.
[00:53:33.086 --> 00:53:33.726]  And that's sad.
[00:53:33.806 --> 00:53:34.507]  That's really sad.
[00:53:34.887 --> 00:53:46.496]  Well, they were flushing him down the toilet, and what's going on is it's a bunch of cowardly politicians that just want to look like heroes, and oh, Obama took out Osama, and then meanwhile, they have to be gotten rid of just like...
[00:53:47.489 --> 00:53:49.470]  Jessica Lynch's team.
[00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:50.231]  And Pat Tillman.
[00:53:50.491 --> 00:53:52.773]  When they started coming out and speaking out, they started dying.
[00:53:53.093 --> 00:53:55.775]  Well, folks, that's it for this expanded edition.
[00:53:55.995 --> 00:53:56.595]  Anything else, Rob?
[00:53:56.815 --> 00:53:57.756]  No, I think we covered it.
[00:53:58.136 --> 00:53:58.837]  As quick as we could.
[00:53:58.857 --> 00:54:00.558]  There's a ton of information out there.
[00:54:00.578 --> 00:54:03.340]  There's a lot of little nitpicking things you could find.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.602]  I would say go to that 10 Facts that Prove Ben Laden Fable is a Contrived Hoax.
[00:54:06.862 --> 00:54:07.722]  It came out May 9, 2011.
[00:54:08.763 --> 00:54:09.203]  Right there.
[00:54:09.844 --> 00:54:12.786]  Start with that article, and then that will lead you down the rabbit hole.
[00:54:13.306 --> 00:54:13.786]  Well, you're right.
[00:54:13.826 --> 00:54:17.308]  And expanding on that, people have to understand something.
[00:54:17.969 --> 00:54:23.792]  When you look at this story, and you actually look at the timeline, they've never stayed on the same story.
[00:54:24.052 --> 00:54:25.273]  They've always changed it.
[00:54:25.493 --> 00:54:35.299]  And then if you question it, you're attacked by CNN and Fox News for questioning something where we don't even know what the narrative is, and they can't even get... But people say, oh, that's a shoddy job by them.
[00:54:35.359 --> 00:54:41.323]  No, that's a tactic where you can't find the truth because there's so many different lies being spewed.
[00:54:41.863 --> 00:54:47.185]  And at the end of the day, it's all about a propaganda victory for the criminals that have hijacked this nation.
[00:54:47.245 --> 00:54:47.806]  It's like this.
[00:54:48.306 --> 00:54:51.027]  You always tell the truth, that way you don't have to remember what you said.
[00:54:51.687 --> 00:54:52.108]  That's it.
[00:54:52.248 --> 00:54:55.909]  These guys can't remember what they were told, so they're all telling different stories.
[00:54:55.949 --> 00:54:57.670]  And that's just, that's the way it is.
[00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:03.032]  I mean, there's no other way to explain the same guys who supposedly went on the same mission having different tales.
[00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:04.513]  There's no way to explain it.
[00:55:06.621 --> 00:55:10.642]  What we know is, is that Bin Laden didn't live, you know, 12 years in a cave.
[00:55:10.983 --> 00:55:11.443]  He died.
[00:55:11.483 --> 00:55:13.744]  Even CBS News reported on that, that he was at the U.S.
[00:55:13.784 --> 00:55:14.244]  hospital.
[00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:15.544]  It's incredible.
[00:55:15.604 --> 00:55:16.725]  All right, great job to the team.
[00:55:16.785 --> 00:55:19.886]  Great job to Leanne McAdoo, earlier, doing the news portion.
[00:55:20.226 --> 00:55:26.968]  Again, InfoWars Nightly News is always 30 minutes long, but a lot of nights we expand it with special reports, like election night, the great job we all did.
[00:55:27.008 --> 00:55:28.729]  We did nine hours, nine hours this
[00:55:28.769 --> 00:55:29.489]  We're good to go.
[00:55:56.587 --> 00:56:00.512]  You are watching the InfoWars Nightly News, which airs 7 p.m.
