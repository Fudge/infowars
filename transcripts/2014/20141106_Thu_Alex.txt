[00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:07.547]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:09.308]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:11.070]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.651]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:14.192]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.192 --> 00:00:18.395]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:22.438]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:50.593]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday, already the sixth day of November 2014.
[00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:54.034]  We're going to have open phones yet again.
[00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:57.515]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us from London, England.
[00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:01.757]  He was scanning over news articles and discovered buried in a Forbes
[00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:20.329]  article the admission by a major pharmacologist that there is a system-wide government directive to cover up and not report suspected Ebola cases that there is a cover-up going on.
[00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.131]  Now remember that we had Dr. Lorenzi on
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:37.070]  By name, a few weeks ago, and they didn't counter what he said in Missouri, that he was told by other doctors that people that looked like they had Ebola were being disappeared.
[00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.472]  No, he was just basically ostracized.
[00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:48.900]  And we confirmed through another medical doctor who heads up a large hospital group, I'll leave it at that, in Dallas, that I know personally, that indeed that is going on.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.881]  In fact, he told us that
[00:01:51.061 --> 00:02:05.405]  Before Dr. Lorenzi, and we mentioned that we talked to a medical doctor on air who said this was happening, and then Dr. Lorenzi called in to say, yeah, that's going on at the Harry Truman Hospital up here in Missouri.
[00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:11.667]  So I will delve back some into Ebola today, or Ebola.
[00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:20.070]  We will delve back into it because clearly, if you've already had cases showing up, they're letting more flights come in from Africa and countries struck while it's spreading.
[00:02:21.627 --> 00:02:30.915]  And beginning to make its ascent towards a peak, as many as 1.4 million people, the UN computer models show.
[00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:40.542]  Well, if you've got a couple hundred thousand with it, and Ebola cases have gotten here, and you're going to get over a million with it, and they're going to let the flights come in, I think it's a safe bet to say more Ebola's going to come here.
[00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:45.546]  Not saying it's going to spread everywhere and kill everybody, but it's a pretty big deal for those that get it.
[00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:46.867]  Why aren't they trying to stop it?
[00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:48.549]  Why are they turning the default positions off?
[00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.891]  We've hashed all this out, and I've been saying
[00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.151]  If there is a cover-up of Ebola, which I think there is to a certain extent, bare minimum.
[00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:00.552]  I pray it's not a big cover-up going on.
[00:03:00.552 --> 00:03:03.473]  That is a cover-up of a bunch of cases.
[00:03:03.473 --> 00:03:06.654]  But we're going to find out very quickly after the midterm elections.
[00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:11.056]  Well, midterm elections were two days ago, or a day and a half ago.
[00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:17.619]  And already we're seeing statements in Forbes, media agrees not to report on suspected Ebola cases in
[00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:34.765]  Pharmacologist reveals how US press and other press for that matter has bowed to government demand to keep Americans in the dark which creates more concern.
[00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:43.388]  So we've got Paul Watson coming on in about 10 minutes to break this down with us briefly and I'll get into the other Ebola news that we have here in the stack as well.
[00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.722]  Then I'm going to shift gears into the latest on the seismic realignment we've seen.
[00:03:48.722 --> 00:04:03.395]  Election 2014, the midterms that Matt Drudge said two years ago are everything and predicted would be either a major realignment or the signal that you can stick a fork in the U.S., we're done.
[00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:09.140]  And so even though I don't expect puppy dogs and kittens to fly and everything to be fine now,
[00:04:10.737 --> 00:04:12.238]  The fact that the U.S.
[00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:26.049]  repudiated collectivism, crony capitalism, and all the different variants of this quasi-fascist system shows that we're not completely brain dead and there's a huge awakening taking place.
[00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:27.710]  That we're in the fight.
[00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.151]  It doesn't mean everything's fine.
[00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:32.534]  It doesn't mean that I think the Republicans are going to save us.
[00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:33.335]  But it is a good sign.
[00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:36.642]  A very good sign.
[00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:48.269]  And it's a good sign the Republican and Democratic leadership and the establishment state-run media, what Rush calls the drive-by media, are lined up against the Tea Party.
[00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:54.253]  Because the Tea Party's not radical, it's just basic, old-fashioned freedom.
[00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:56.034]  And so that's why it's the enemy.
[00:04:56.034 --> 00:04:59.336]  Because it's the cure to the disease of collectivism.
[00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.292]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:08.575]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.356]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:15.680]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.221]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.362]  But for how long?
[00:05:19.362 --> 00:05:21.584]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:25.987]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:25.987 --> 00:05:28.809]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.

[00:05:40.803 --> 00:05:47.268]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.273]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.

[00:06:22.617 --> 00:06:27.941]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:28.962]  Not our iodine.
[00:06:28.962 --> 00:06:32.765]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:35.307]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:07:09.835 --> 00:07:19.762]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:19.762 --> 00:07:22.684]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:07:22.884 --> 00:07:23.505]  I think so.
[00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:50.790]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[00:08:10.405 --> 00:08:13.069]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:14.931]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:20.538]  It's the time of the season.
[00:08:20.538 --> 00:08:23.201]  When love runs high.
[00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:26.546]  In this time, give it to me easy.
[00:08:29.602 --> 00:08:30.623]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:30.623 --> 00:08:34.928]  Welcome to another live, original, worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:34.928 --> 00:08:36.910]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:43.878]  It's already the sixth day of November 2014 on this Thursday edition.
[00:08:43.878 --> 00:08:48.323]  Well, guess who we have coming on to give us his expert inside take on Ebola?
[00:08:49.437 --> 00:08:53.340]  He's been to Africa many times and researched it in depth.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.103]  He is Steven Hatfield.
[00:08:56.103 --> 00:09:10.494]  Dr. Steven Hatfield, the virologist and bioweapons expert who went what many believed was a trial by the media and a witch hunt by the FBI and others to pin the anthrax attacks of 2001
[00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:16.880]  On him.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.603]  He is going to be joining us to talk Ebola and more.
[00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:26.765]  And the Pentagon working on an airborne Ebola vaccine.
[00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:27.445]  That's coming up.
[00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:34.609]  Paul Watson will be joining us here in about five minutes to discuss this breaking news on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:34.609 --> 00:09:35.910]  U.S.
[00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.691]  media gets in line dutifully.
[00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:40.690]  Except for Forbes!
[00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:55.195]  And they are reporting what we started reporting back in October when we had a medical doctor on record on air listing the hospital where people that appeared to have Ebola were being disappeared by the feds.
[00:09:55.195 --> 00:10:00.057]  Regardless whether they had Ebola or not, they're being disappeared.
[00:10:00.057 --> 00:10:02.798]  That's the big story.
[00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:06.459]  And we were told that by high-level border patrol on record and off record as well.
[00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:08.479]  So, proof's in the pudding.
[00:10:08.479 --> 00:10:21.286]  We are bringing you the people, the sources, by name, and then for every source that'll come on here, we have, let's not exaggerate, 20, 30 more that won't.
[00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:28.551]  Sending us, police sending us their IDs, doctors sending us their IDs, because we just don't just believe somebody because they email us.
[00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:35.815]  We have them send us a copy of their ID, we call them at work, we talk to them, and then keep them off record if they want to be off record, but we verify.
[00:10:36.647 --> 00:10:40.068]  And that takes a lot of courage, just what they're doing at that level.
[00:10:40.068 --> 00:10:45.810]  Well, I was not happy when I saw Paul Joseph Watson's article this morning, because I don't want Ebola to start spreading.
[00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.111]  I don't want to be right.
[00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:51.072]  I don't want to be correct.
[00:10:51.072 --> 00:11:02.517]  But clearly, if all this Ebola's already gotten out of Africa, and they're leaving the borders wide open, and it's not set to peak till January, with 1.4 million people set to get it in the UN computer models,
[00:11:03.427 --> 00:11:11.852]  You're going to have more people that make it over here, and Obama has said to expect that, and he has said he expects to see more cases.
[00:11:11.852 --> 00:11:19.717]  Will you get a chain reaction in cold weather, where the virus can live upwards of two weeks on surfaces?
[00:11:19.717 --> 00:11:23.940]  Pentagon says 20 days.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.101]  And it is airborne, essentially?
[00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:28.523]  Then we could have a hellish situation in this country.
[00:11:30.452 --> 00:11:32.333]  Well here's the headline, InfoWars.com.
[00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:37.797]  Media agrees not to report on suspected Ebola cases in the U.S.
[00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:47.385]  Pharmacologist reveals how press has bowed to government demand to Americans to keep Americans in the dark.
[00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:48.786]  And we link through to the Forbes article.
[00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:50.349]  I think?
[00:12:10.126 --> 00:12:15.347]  Traveler at Duke Hospital shows preliminary negative results for Ebola.
[00:12:15.347 --> 00:12:35.352]  Kroll describes attending a press conference involving Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Woese, Aldana Woese, after revealing that an unnamed official abruptly called the press conference to a close when Woese was asked a difficult question about the suspected Ebola victim.
[00:12:35.352 --> 00:12:36.912]  Kroll then drops a bombshell.
[00:12:38.817 --> 00:12:51.223]  The Associated Press and other press outlets have agreed not to report on suspected cases of Ebola in the United States until a positive viral RNA test is completed, he writes.
[00:12:51.223 --> 00:12:55.666]  But by then, they've been whisked away to a secret location.
[00:12:55.666 --> 00:13:02.009]  You understand, people are dying on airplanes out of West Africa, vomiting to death, with blood spewing out their rear ends.
[00:13:03.288 --> 00:13:12.511]  That's why, for a month and a half, at JFK, they have strikers who won't clean the airplanes and who won't go to the airport.
[00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:15.412]  You think they want to lose their jobs, people that clean those airplanes?
[00:13:15.412 --> 00:13:18.613]  They're scared, folks, because there's blood and vomit on them.
[00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:20.913]  You got blood and vomit planes coming into Houston.
[00:13:20.913 --> 00:13:22.134]  That's been in the news there.
[00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:25.855]  Blood and vomit planes coming into North Carolina, into Raleigh and other areas.
[00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:27.115]  That's been in local news.
[00:13:27.115 --> 00:13:29.096]  Blood and vomit planes coming into New York.
[00:13:29.096 --> 00:13:31.116]  Blood and vomit planes coming into Chicago.
[00:13:31.116 --> 00:13:32.697]  Blood and vomit planes coming into Dallas.
[00:13:33.442 --> 00:13:34.883]  But it's always a little local argument.
[00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:40.247]  Oh, they were vomiting and bleeding, but you'll hear within an hour of the plane landing and the panic.
[00:13:40.247 --> 00:13:46.052]  They tested negative for Ebola when they can't test that quickly.
[00:13:46.052 --> 00:13:56.140]  I mean, clearly, some of these people coming in who die at the airport in Houston, die at the airport when the police go to check at their house and see.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:01.164]  You notice it's always local police and EMTs and neighbors that are reporting it, not the feds.
[00:14:02.628 --> 00:14:11.197]  It's the police in New York who aren't completely federalized that went, no, this doctor that brought in Ebola lied.
[00:14:11.197 --> 00:14:20.187]  He traveled all over the place to bowling alleys and to taxis and subways and restaurants while he was sick.
[00:14:20.187 --> 00:14:20.868]  He's a liar.
[00:14:22.307 --> 00:14:30.713]  See, we're getting from doctors, police, nurses, local news, stuff that looks like Ebola, and it's being covered up.
[00:14:30.713 --> 00:14:40.679]  And then we have the doctor come on by name and tell you they've been ordered to say that it is malaria.
[00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:45.562]  When malaria only in very rare cases has some bleeding.
[00:14:45.562 --> 00:14:48.464]  Very rare.
[00:14:48.464 --> 00:14:49.285]  Nothing like Ebola.
[00:14:51.508 --> 00:14:59.315]  So, this is a serious situation, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope it's not spreading, but let me explain something.
[00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:12.346]  The Border Patrol gave us tips, it was actually ICE, we want to be technical, in January that the border had been ordered completely open and they were staging groups of illegals and being ordered to ship them deeper in the country.
[00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:17.451]  It took me a good four or five months to get up off my butt and send reporters down there
[00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:27.831]  And they went, and sure enough, there are the buses being loaded with the illegals, the vouchers are being given to them by the Border Patrol, and they're being deployed into the U.S.
[00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:30.051]  to Democratic Party facilities.
[00:15:30.051 --> 00:15:33.512]  Private homes, churches, you name it.
[00:15:33.512 --> 00:15:38.293]  Schools during the summer that were empty.
[00:15:38.293 --> 00:15:41.214]  It then took a month for that to break in the New York Times.
[00:15:41.214 --> 00:15:46.635]  Why do I mention that in relation to Ebola?
[00:15:46.635 --> 00:15:47.896]  Because if you can get 300-400,000 people
[00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:54.427]  It's 100,000 youth, but a couple hundred thousand more adults that came with them.
[00:15:54.427 --> 00:16:06.819]  If you can get 300,000 people in and InfoWars can't report on it for five months, and the mainstream media it took seven months, this is how controlled press works.
[00:16:06.819 --> 00:16:08.440]  The alternative media can't do everything.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.901]  We're completely overwhelmed.
[00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:15.727]  It's like trying to drink Lake Superior with a regular straw.
[00:16:15.727 --> 00:16:16.548]  It just can't be done.
[00:16:17.739 --> 00:16:35.931]  So, if there is Ebola spreading, and they don't want the media to report on it, you're not going to find out about it, unless more whistleblowers go public, and unless we're able to document it in articles, and then DrudgeReport.com picks it up.
[00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:40.954]  And believe me, they don't like the fact that we're able to sometime run their blockade, and actually get the stuff out.
[00:16:42.264 --> 00:16:43.946]  They're very angry at us for doing this.
[00:16:43.946 --> 00:16:46.027]  They've demonized us like nothing I've ever done.
[00:16:46.027 --> 00:16:52.553]  We have been attacked just on a daily basis for months over this Ebola situation.
[00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:53.794]  First it wasn't going to come here.
[00:16:53.794 --> 00:16:55.496]  Then it wasn't airborne.
[00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:56.757]  Then they weren't covering it up.
[00:16:56.757 --> 00:17:01.201]  Then having Ebola patients at regular hospitals wouldn't spread it.
[00:17:01.201 --> 00:17:02.723]  Of course we were right about everything.
[00:17:02.723 --> 00:17:03.904]  They were wrong about everything.
[00:17:03.904 --> 00:17:09.188]  Because they were lying deliberately.
[00:17:09.188 --> 00:17:09.409]  So...
[00:17:11.226 --> 00:17:11.966]  What do we do?
[00:17:11.966 --> 00:17:15.527]  Clearly there is Ebola in the country and they're covering it up.
[00:17:15.527 --> 00:17:19.448]  I hope that it's very low-level.
[00:17:19.448 --> 00:17:26.329]  But why would they be leaving the borders wide open then if they're trying to cover it up and suppress it at the same time?
[00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.210]  So something doesn't add up here.
[00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.190]  We'll open the phones up on this subject.
[00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.750]  Election 2014.
[00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.511]  How big is this major realignment?
[00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:34.511]  Toll-free number to join us.
[00:17:35.629 --> 00:17:36.530]  Wide open phones, 800-259-9231.
[00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:36.590]  800-259-9231.
[00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.251]  All I ask is that you be on topic.
[00:17:38.251 --> 00:17:39.231]  We love your calls.
[00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:40.292]  We appreciate you calling.
[00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:42.193]  But just please have a good telephone.
[00:17:42.193 --> 00:17:42.574]  800-259-9231.
[00:17:42.574 --> 00:17:43.554]  Paul Watson's a shabby guy.
[00:17:43.554 --> 00:17:45.415]  I hired him 13 years ago when he was running PropagandaMatrix.com.
[00:17:45.415 --> 00:17:46.716]  He's done a great job for us.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.544]  Does a lot of research just like I do and I really respect his view of all the analysts we interview.
[00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:10.307]  He's one of the smartest out there and most read.
[00:18:10.307 --> 00:18:15.852]  So I want to bring him on right now from London via video Skype.
[00:18:15.852 --> 00:18:19.655]  Paul, what is your gut before we get into your latest article on what's going on?
[00:18:19.655 --> 00:18:28.764]  For me, this just verifies yet again that at press conferences this is rigged and that this is a Forbes writer admitting they've agreed to cover up.
[00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:39.776]  I wonder if he'll get in trouble for exposing the cover-up, because he definitely put that at the end to show that he didn't get in too much trouble, but still tried to warn people, clearly.
[00:18:39.776 --> 00:18:40.757]  We're going to try to get him on the show.
[00:18:42.748 --> 00:18:48.752]  Well, I mean, Alex, what does it say about freedom of the press when, you know, this happened one week before the election.
[00:18:48.752 --> 00:18:53.476]  Ebola, in terms of a national news story, completely dropped off the radar.
[00:18:53.476 --> 00:18:59.841]  There were still suspected cases all over the country because people send them to me every single day.
[00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:02.863]  Yet nationally, it completely dropped off the picture.
[00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:08.187]  I mean, you've got an administration that's the most hostile to media since Nixon.
[00:19:08.187 --> 00:19:18.615]  And now we found out that this order went out from the Obama administration to the media, telling them not to report on suspected Ebola cases in the United States.
[00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:20.876]  It happens one week before an election.
[00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:22.758]  And as he said, it's buried.
[00:19:22.758 --> 00:19:27.822]  It's the last paragraph of this Forbes article which came out a few days ago.
[00:19:27.822 --> 00:19:30.864]  We were probably one of the first to report it this morning.
[00:19:31.424 --> 00:19:37.889]  And it says that the Associated Press and other press outlets have agreed not to report on suspected cases of Ebola in the United States.
[00:19:37.889 --> 00:19:38.349]  Stay there!
[00:19:38.349 --> 00:19:40.551]  I want to get your take on where you see this is going.
[00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:42.572]  We're going to try to get this rider on.
[00:19:42.572 --> 00:19:45.495]  This just confirms, trouble confirms what we already knew.
[00:19:45.495 --> 00:19:51.439]  So your headline should probably be, Obama administration caught ordering media not to report on Ebola.
[00:19:51.439 --> 00:19:53.601]  I mean that's really, I mean we knew that was going on.
[00:19:54.366 --> 00:19:57.387]  They've told the police, the firefighters, everybody to cover up.
[00:19:57.387 --> 00:20:00.347]  But now, this just triple confirms it.
[00:20:00.347 --> 00:20:04.728]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[00:20:04.728 --> 00:20:08.809]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:14.270]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?

[00:21:59.244 --> 00:22:00.505]  Another major health threat.
[00:22:00.505 --> 00:22:05.469]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:22:05.469 --> 00:22:08.171]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:15.196]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:22:15.196 --> 00:22:18.178]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:22:18.178 --> 00:22:21.120]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.162]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:22:23.162 --> 00:22:26.024]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:22:26.084 --> 00:22:31.806]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:22:31.806 --> 00:22:35.308]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:22:35.308 --> 00:22:38.389]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:22:38.389 --> 00:22:42.531]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:46.133]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:51.995]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:53.856]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:23:13.577 --> 00:23:17.839]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:23:17.839 --> 00:23:19.961]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:23.242]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:23:23.242 --> 00:23:24.523]  Children left with no homes.
[00:23:24.523 --> 00:23:26.324]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:23:26.324 --> 00:23:29.166]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:23:29.346 --> 00:23:29.967]  We're good to go.
[00:24:10.959 --> 00:24:12.100]  I got some good news for you.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:26.087]  I was downtown this morning taking care of business, and I ran into two different groups of police officers, two different times, and both groups of police officers ran over and shook my hand and said, appreciate the work you're doing.
[00:24:26.087 --> 00:24:33.851]  One group was two Hispanic officers, the other group was a black and white officer, and I just cannot believe how awake the police are.
[00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:37.572]  It's amazing.
[00:24:37.572 --> 00:24:38.613]  And even though you could say that
[00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:48.263]  The Austin Police Department was doing their job when they caught somebody here plotting to kill me who then ran back to California and killed a cop.
[00:24:48.263 --> 00:24:55.526]  I still do owe him because he was there waiting to kill me and they caught him but couldn't prosecute him and I couldn't be told about it until it was all over.
[00:24:55.526 --> 00:25:06.609]  It's just really weird that even when somebody's just doing their job then you're indebted and then that turns into the whole subject of
[00:25:10.402 --> 00:25:16.964]  How do we remove this big criminal globalist group that's in control of our federal government and try to get this country back on track?
[00:25:16.964 --> 00:25:24.825]  Because we've got so many good people inside the military, the police, the firefighters, the nurses, the doctors.
[00:25:24.825 --> 00:25:30.127]  What you think of as the system, by and large, is good people, but it's the directives that are bad.
[00:25:30.127 --> 00:25:31.127]  It's those in control.
[00:25:31.127 --> 00:25:36.868]  And I know we all know this, so why can't we fix it?
[00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:37.929]  That's what I'm trying to get at.
[00:25:37.929 --> 00:25:39.809]  The American people, by and large, are good people.
[00:25:40.987 --> 00:25:47.533]  Unless you're talking about young, spoiled college students, and a lot of them are awake, or they're completely dumbed down.
[00:25:47.533 --> 00:25:53.658]  It's just not going to work anymore to call people conspiracy theorists when they question the system that's known to be lying.
[00:25:53.658 --> 00:25:55.880]  I didn't mean to digress there.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.683]  It's just that America is waking up, and it's accelerated.
[00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:01.665]  And the accelerated awakening, the tip of that,
[00:26:03.314 --> 00:26:05.415]  is in government itself.
[00:26:05.415 --> 00:26:07.636]  So that's got to worry the establishment.
[00:26:07.636 --> 00:26:17.919]  That's why we know the NSA focuses its spying on local, county, and state and federal government as well, to try to keep them in line from exposing the larger program.
[00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:20.520]  Paul Watson's our guest coming up.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.001]  Obama vows to proceed with executive amnesty for illegals?
[00:26:24.001 --> 00:26:24.961]  What landslide?
[00:26:24.961 --> 00:26:29.503]  Obama threatens vetoes and executive orders, including immigration reform this year.
[00:26:30.796 --> 00:26:32.598]  I love how they call treason immigration reform.
[00:26:32.598 --> 00:26:35.320]  Just totally open it up to anybody.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.164]  After Americans reject him by giving Republicans historic gains in Congress.
[00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:40.245]  Paul, this is a short segment.
[00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:41.025]  You'll be with us in the next.
[00:26:41.025 --> 00:26:41.946]  Then we'll go to phone calls.
[00:26:41.946 --> 00:26:45.409]  But let's go ahead and get back into Ebola.
[00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:50.053]  For those that just joined us, this is a big deal to have a major Forbes writer who's also a pharmacologist.
[00:26:50.996 --> 00:26:52.297]  There is America this cowardly?
[00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:13.206]  Uh, that people won't blow the whistle?
[00:27:13.206 --> 00:27:15.686]  Cops, day one, told us they've been ordered to cover it up.
[00:27:15.686 --> 00:27:17.367]  Firemen, day one, told us.
[00:27:17.367 --> 00:27:20.388]  And then a doctor, and then another doctor, and then another doctor.
[00:27:20.388 --> 00:27:24.209]  But, other than that, you would think people wouldn't go along with this, Paul.
[00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:27.250]  What type of country do we live in?
[00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.652]  Well, you're living in a country with state-controlled media.
[00:27:30.652 --> 00:27:34.453]  I mean, look what Anita Dunn said, the former White House Communications Director.
[00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:41.911]  Very rarely did we communicate through the press anything that we didn't absolutely control, she told Dominican officials.
[00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:44.833]  So, they openly admit that they control the press.
[00:27:44.833 --> 00:27:51.418]  There's a headline last year, White House photographers' mutiny over Obama's Soviet-style controls.
[00:27:51.418 --> 00:27:56.141]  They weren't even allowed to take photos of Obama at these White House events.
[00:27:56.141 --> 00:27:59.563]  Everything had to be authorized and done in-house.
[00:27:59.563 --> 00:28:02.806]  They complained that it was a Soviet-style control over the media.
[00:28:03.226 --> 00:28:15.674]  And then you've got these White House pull reports, which the White House can edit and exercises its power to do so on a regular basis before they're sent out to news outlets, federal agencies, and congressional offices.
[00:28:15.674 --> 00:28:25.100]  So they've got such tight control over the media now that the Associated Press and others just acquiesced immediately and said, yes, we'll do whatever you say regarding Ebola.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:25.821]  And it's worse than that.
[00:28:26.601 --> 00:28:37.491]  CNN, others have been caught, AP as well, they'll edit his speeches to make them sound better when he messes up on a teleprompter without the White House even telling them!
[00:28:37.491 --> 00:28:41.454]  Oh yeah, White House court doctoring transcript of Obama's speech.
[00:28:41.454 --> 00:28:48.640]  They take out things which are embarrassing, they take out errors when it's supposed to be a verbatim transcript every time.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.162]  Again, brazenly lying to the American people.
[00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:54.325]  And so, you know, we had a poll back in October, the middle of October,
[00:28:54.805 --> 00:28:59.529]  Half of Americans don't believe the federal government is telling the truth about Ebola.
[00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:01.231]  And with very good reason.
[00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:11.400]  Because behind the scenes, as you mentioned earlier, we're getting contacted by UPS managers saying that they're sending a quarter of a million hazmat suits to Dallas.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.461]  To Dallas alone.
[00:29:13.041 --> 00:29:15.283]  So now you've got this flu season coming up.
[00:29:15.283 --> 00:29:23.631]  You've got top experts like the former FDA official who also wrote in Forbes that there are going to be a spate of cases in major American cities.
[00:29:23.631 --> 00:29:29.376]  You've got other scientists saying they're going to be over 130 cases of Ebola in American cities.
[00:29:29.376 --> 00:29:30.698]  And then you've got the flu season.
[00:29:31.278 --> 00:29:36.120]  Where people are going to be reporting Ebola-like symptoms, and that's going to get confused with influenza.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:42.042]  Let's talk about the hysteria that's going to come, especially when government lied about this up front.
[00:29:42.042 --> 00:29:44.123]  That will create total distrust.
[00:29:44.123 --> 00:29:46.844]  And that's 130 cases on the low-end computer models.
[00:29:46.844 --> 00:29:48.784]  Some models show thousands of cases.
[00:29:48.784 --> 00:29:49.705]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.105]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.105 --> 00:29:52.566]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.566 --> 00:29:53.746]  Can you imagine the hysteria?
[00:29:53.746 --> 00:29:56.307]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.393 --> 00:30:02.374]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:30:02.374 --> 00:30:06.895]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:30:06.895 --> 00:30:11.376]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:18.678]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:30:18.678 --> 00:30:27.741]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:30:27.961 --> 00:30:33.505]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:30:33.505 --> 00:30:41.110]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[00:31:12.841 --> 00:31:18.802]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not
[00:31:19.042 --> 00:31:19.262]  Of course.
[00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:40.090]  Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder.
[00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:50.894]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[00:32:00.532 --> 00:32:01.773]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:01.773 --> 00:32:06.755]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:06.755 --> 00:32:09.436]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:09.436 --> 00:32:16.479]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:16.479 --> 00:32:19.440]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.421]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:24.442]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:27.283]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:33.086]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:33.086 --> 00:32:36.607]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:32:36.607 --> 00:32:39.688]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:32:39.688 --> 00:32:47.012]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:33:02.921 --> 00:33:07.983]  I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own.
[00:33:07.983 --> 00:33:23.830]  I've also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.
[00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:29.393]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:42.957 --> 00:33:52.604]  Well, ACDC drummer Phil Rudd charged with attempting to procure murder, or hire murder, in New Zealand.
[00:33:52.604 --> 00:33:55.607]  Australian musician appears in New Zealand court after raided home.
[00:33:55.607 --> 00:34:01.011]  What now for ACDC after Phil Rudd's arrest?
[00:34:02.887 --> 00:34:08.891]  On Malcolm Young's retirement, ACDC set to launch a new album.
[00:34:08.891 --> 00:34:22.399]  Let me tell you, there's a lot of hits get called in Hollywood.
[00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:29.384]  The ACDC drummer Phil Rudd has been charged in New Zealand with attempting to procure murder, threatening to kill, and possession of drugs.
[00:34:32.549 --> 00:34:33.910]  So stupid.
[00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:36.911]  What, you think you're in the political mafia like Obozo?
[00:34:36.911 --> 00:34:38.012]  Eric Holder?
[00:34:38.012 --> 00:34:40.113]  Where they, I guess, can get away with murder?
[00:34:40.113 --> 00:34:40.914]  In Benghazi?
[00:34:40.914 --> 00:34:42.614]  In Fast and Furious?
[00:34:42.614 --> 00:34:46.036]  Yeah, those are the real dirty deeds.
[00:34:46.036 --> 00:34:47.837]  Done dirt cheap.
[00:34:47.837 --> 00:34:49.618]  Dirty deeds.
[00:34:49.618 --> 00:34:51.439]  Done dirt cheap.
[00:34:51.439 --> 00:34:53.180]  Dirty deeds.
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.041]  Done dirt cheap.
[00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:58.623]  Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.
[00:34:58.623 --> 00:35:01.425]  Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.189]  You know, I think if you're going to kill somebody, you better do it yourself.
[00:35:07.189 --> 00:35:08.914]  Someone's going to hire people to do it.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.721]  I read that in a book somewhere.
[00:35:12.721 --> 00:35:17.263]  Why on earth would you run around as a celebrity and try to hire people to kill folks for you?
[00:35:17.263 --> 00:35:20.105]  Nine times out of ten, it's an informant, it's made up.
[00:35:20.105 --> 00:35:21.706]  Besides, why would you want to kill somebody?
[00:35:21.706 --> 00:35:32.631]  Because these rich people, these high-profile stars and folks, constantly are trying to get people killed, and do get people killed routinely, because they're on such power trips they think they're invincible.
[00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:35.853]  Well, they need to follow OJ's example.
[00:35:35.853 --> 00:35:38.134]  Yeah, OJ did the job himself.
[00:35:38.134 --> 00:35:38.915]  Dirt cheap.
[00:35:38.915 --> 00:35:39.455]  Dirt cheap.
[00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:46.535]  And then they ran on race to cover it up and that didn't work still.
[00:35:46.535 --> 00:36:01.311]  I was told by a LAPD detective that it was really somebody else in the family but that OJ took the fall to cover it up.
[00:36:01.311 --> 00:36:02.533]  People do anything for their kids.
[00:36:05.262 --> 00:36:07.586]  Okay, let's just stop right there.
[00:36:07.586 --> 00:36:12.115]  Low-profile New York City prosecutor, we're going back to Watson.
[00:36:12.115 --> 00:36:17.304]  Low-profile New York City prosecutor emerges as contender to be first black woman U.S.
[00:36:17.304 --> 00:36:17.906]  Attorney General.
[00:36:20.697 --> 00:36:27.560]  Well, I don't care if she's a black woman, but what I do care about is that she comes from a very corrupt area in New York, where U.S.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:33.282]  attorneys have been caught doing all sorts of political persecution of Republicans, Libertarians, Christians, churches.
[00:36:33.282 --> 00:36:37.444]  In fact, I've seen this lady's name before going after tea parties.
[00:36:37.444 --> 00:36:45.627]  So, the big news here, this is from Fox News, and that she's being looked at, if our writers want to dig into her, I remember her office
[00:36:47.126 --> 00:36:57.049]  Uh, being, uh, mentioned in some of the Tea Party pro-lifer, uh, harassment of 501c3s and things.
[00:36:57.049 --> 00:37:00.531]  And it's right next door to the one that went after Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:37:00.531 --> 00:37:02.631]  And I think her office aided in that.
[00:37:02.631 --> 00:37:05.372]  I'm going from memory, but look into it.
[00:37:05.372 --> 00:37:05.992]  Look into it.
[00:37:05.992 --> 00:37:10.054]  She's a, she's a attack dog, uh, from what I know.
[00:37:10.054 --> 00:37:13.135]  So let's research that.
[00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:19.043]  She's an under-the-radar contender to become the first black woman to head the Justice Department.
[00:37:19.043 --> 00:37:26.365]  Loretta Lynch rarely holds a news conference, does interviews, or gives speeches in her current job as U.S.
[00:37:26.365 --> 00:37:27.846]  Attorney in Brooklyn.
[00:37:29.108 --> 00:37:29.848]  Oh, think U.S.
[00:37:29.848 --> 00:37:33.710]  attorneys in Brooklyn might be a little dirty under the fingernails?
[00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:34.730]  I don't know.
[00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.391]  Think Al Capone might have been a gangster?
[00:37:36.391 --> 00:37:37.671]  I don't know.
[00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:42.453]  But the lack of a paper trail on Lynch hasn't kept her from emerging in recent weeks.
[00:37:42.453 --> 00:37:43.573]  That's why they want her.
[00:37:43.573 --> 00:37:44.713]  Perfect puppet.
[00:37:44.713 --> 00:37:50.956]  As one of only a handful of people still under consideration by White House to replace the outgoing Eric Holder.
[00:37:50.956 --> 00:37:54.577]  I don't know what Fox is talking about, there's no paper trail on this lady.
[00:37:54.577 --> 00:37:57.738]  I remember that district office going after people.
[00:38:01.206 --> 00:38:04.507]  Alright, we're going to dig into her and give you more on that.
[00:38:04.507 --> 00:38:06.728]  You know, Paul, it's really scary.
[00:38:06.728 --> 00:38:13.130]  Not just that our own government, you mentioned other Forbes articles and AP articles saying they expect over 100 Ebola cases.
[00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.092]  Obama's getting people ready saying, oh, I expect to see some more but it's no big deal.
[00:38:17.092 --> 00:38:20.413]  We get demonized saying that clearly they're covering it up.
[00:38:20.413 --> 00:38:25.755]  That is so newsworthy, Paul, that they're disappearing people.
[00:38:25.755 --> 00:38:28.516]  Notice the hospital didn't challenge the medical doctor we had on.
[00:38:29.636 --> 00:38:34.017]  They didn't say he was a liar, we were wrong.
[00:38:34.017 --> 00:38:40.199]  They just demonized InfoWars and said that we're horrible people, but didn't counter any of the information.
[00:38:40.199 --> 00:38:44.480]  And they had White House-connected grips, like Media Matters attack us.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.221]  Will we lose credibility when more Ebola cases show up, or will they lose credibility, Paul?
[00:38:49.741 --> 00:38:51.342]  Well, I mean, this is the thing, isn't it, Alex?
[00:38:51.342 --> 00:38:55.524]  We talked to Zack Taylor, the Border Patrol veteran, who said they were disappearing people.
[00:38:55.524 --> 00:39:00.968]  And that's the point that Scott Gottlieb made in his editorial for Forbes about a week ago.
[00:39:00.968 --> 00:39:05.871]  He said that once it hits Latin America, then, you know, all bets are off, basically.
[00:39:05.871 --> 00:39:16.617]  Quote, as we have seen with the anxiety engendered by just a few isolated cases, if we were to have a dozen or more cases in a major USA, it would have a substantial impact on our economic and social life.
[00:39:16.977 --> 00:39:25.284]  And he's talking about the immigrants coming in from Latin America with Ebola, which is interesting because there's a story up on Drudge right now.
[00:39:25.284 --> 00:39:26.705]  Amazing story.
[00:39:26.705 --> 00:39:36.593]  A beach in Gran Canaria, basically this boatload of people from Sierra Leone with Ebola symptoms just arrived on the beach.
[00:39:36.593 --> 00:39:42.498]  They dumped them out of the boat and they were sat around on the beach as these nudist beach goers
[00:39:43.439 --> 00:39:44.560]  We're good to go.
[00:40:03.285 --> 00:40:10.691]  Well that's what the head of Southcom said months after we said it and then we were attacked and so was the head of Southcom for saying the obvious.
[00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:11.972]  That's another thing.
[00:40:11.972 --> 00:40:14.554]  The government can't coordinate its bull.
[00:40:14.554 --> 00:40:17.216]  You've got this czar who orders the media to shut up.
[00:40:17.216 --> 00:40:18.057]  They go along with it.
[00:40:18.817 --> 00:40:26.999]  But the police and Northcom and other groups are not going along with the cover-up.
[00:40:26.999 --> 00:40:28.380]  I mean, I don't care what city it is.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.241]  Dallas, New York City, the police aren't going along with the cover-up.
[00:40:32.241 --> 00:40:34.201]  Northcom's not going along with it.
[00:40:34.201 --> 00:40:37.122]  The head of Southcom is not going along with it.
[00:40:37.122 --> 00:40:38.163]  What does that mean?
[00:40:38.163 --> 00:40:43.104]  It shows Obama is not in control, which is actually a good thing.
[00:40:44.502 --> 00:40:49.445]  Yeah, and remember they also told the 9-11 dispatchers in New York not to mention cases of Ebola.
[00:40:49.445 --> 00:41:07.434]  But what worries me, and you mentioned Ron Klein before, who of course said there were too many people in Africa, he's an advocate of population reduction, is the fact that this story which I put out probably about 10 days ago now, NGO envisages global one-child policy pandemics to solve overpopulation.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:19.967]  And this paper, which I read in full, was edited by Paul Ehrlich, who of course is a close ally, scientific ally, of John P. Holdren, the White House Science Czar.
[00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:28.793]  He co-authored Ecoscience with Holdren, which of course advocated a planetary regime to enforce draconian methods of population reduction.
[00:41:29.313 --> 00:41:47.623]  And if you read this paper, it's absolutely shocking, because they basically make the point that a new global war, a new type of Spanish flu, and a new pandemic which kills 6 billion people over the next three decades or so, is not going to be enough.
[00:41:47.623 --> 00:41:55.948]  They lament the fact that 6 billion dead people, when the population gets to about 9 billion by 2050, is not going to be enough.
[00:41:56.808 --> 00:41:57.749]  For what they want.
[00:41:57.749 --> 00:42:08.397]  So they advocate openly a global one-child policy as is instituted in China, which of course... But that's okay, Paul, because these people are just... Paul, that's okay.
[00:42:08.397 --> 00:42:09.418]  These people are just kooks.
[00:42:09.418 --> 00:42:11.420]  They're not White House science czars.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.961]  They don't sit on the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:42:13.961 --> 00:42:16.964]  They don't sit on the major boards of the Fortune 100.
[00:42:16.964 --> 00:42:18.865]  They're not running global policy.
[00:42:18.865 --> 00:42:19.406]  Oh, wait a minute.
[00:42:19.966 --> 00:42:25.969]  They are running global policy from geoengineering to immigration to the Ebola response.
[00:42:25.969 --> 00:42:34.012]  And as you said, this isn't eco-science written 40 years ago by John P. Holdren and Paul R. Ehrlich saying this.
[00:42:34.012 --> 00:42:35.913]  This was written this year.
[00:42:35.913 --> 00:42:39.434]  They are saying the same thing, but saying a global war is needed.
[00:42:39.434 --> 00:42:42.996]  And now mainstream news is saying a new Cold War is beginning with Russia.
[00:42:44.656 --> 00:42:46.417]  Yeah, but that's the thing, Alex.
[00:42:46.417 --> 00:42:51.160]  A new global war and a pandemic which kills 6 billion, that's not enough for them!
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:56.463]  6 billion's not enough dead people, because it will only get the population down to about 5 billion.
[00:42:56.463 --> 00:43:05.968]  The global one-child policy, if it's properly enforced, which you know in China means kidnapping women off the streets, force-drugging them, beating them half to death,
[00:43:06.468 --> 00:43:09.689]  Giving them an abortion, a forced abortion, then sterilizing them.
[00:43:09.689 --> 00:43:11.630]  That's what they want for everyone.
[00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:15.091]  That will get the population down to about 3 billion.
[00:43:15.091 --> 00:43:18.973]  So, 4 billion down on what it is now.
[00:43:18.973 --> 00:43:20.173]  Even that's not enough.
[00:43:20.173 --> 00:43:25.115]  If you read the actual paper, they want it down to 1 to 2 billion.
[00:43:25.115 --> 00:43:27.036]  Those are the ideal figures for global population.
[00:43:27.056 --> 00:43:36.379]  And by the way, we have a lot of TV viewers and radio listeners out there, because again, if you're a new radio listener, we also simulcast at InfoWars.com forward slash show, PrisonPlanet.com forward slash show.
[00:43:36.379 --> 00:43:51.785]  We'll put your article from a few weeks ago up on screen, and then we'll click through to the actual public document put out by the former White House science czar, who works with the current White House science czar, John P. Holdren, Paul R. Ehrlich.
[00:43:51.785 --> 00:43:56.287]  Give folks, for radio audience out there, the headline on your story, so they can go read it for themselves.
[00:43:57.383 --> 00:44:03.067]  The headline is, NGO envisages global one-child policy pandemics to solve overpopulation.
[00:44:03.067 --> 00:44:05.008]  And that's the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:44:05.008 --> 00:44:06.689]  They published the paper.
[00:44:06.689 --> 00:44:15.355]  They put it behind a paywall, so you have to pay $10 just to read it, which they know that the vast majority of people are not going to do.
[00:44:15.355 --> 00:44:22.980]  I read it, and it says that the quote, sustainable number of people for the world is 1 to 2 billion people.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.443]  So that's, you know, at least 6 billion down on current
[00:44:27.083 --> 00:44:32.905]  Figures, and by the time we get to 9 billion in 2050, you know, it's 7 billion people dead.
[00:44:32.905 --> 00:44:44.968]  But not as a result of pandemics, because they actually modelled it, and they do a nice cute little graphic with a skull and crossbones, with 6 billion dead people mapped out on a chart.
[00:44:44.968 --> 00:44:49.509]  And it shows that it only gets population down to about 5 billion, which is not enough for them.
[00:44:49.509 --> 00:44:53.750]  So they need a global one-child policy, which they openly advocate and say,
[00:44:54.351 --> 00:44:56.704]  Yeah, it's gonna be, quote, politically sensitive.
[00:44:56.704 --> 00:44:57.970]  It might have to be draconian.
[00:44:58.667 --> 00:45:06.974]  And that's what they advocate, to get population down to 3.45 billion by the end of this century, or actually by 2045.
[00:45:06.974 --> 00:45:07.434]  You know what?
[00:45:07.434 --> 00:45:09.376]  That story you did didn't get enough attention.
[00:45:09.376 --> 00:45:24.188]  I want you to repost that as a tile on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and tweet that out on my tweet, on my Twitter, and you're a Twitter, or my tweeter as a former governor of Texas, Rick Perry would call it.
[00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:25.810]  Send that out because this is important.
[00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:26.910]  People need to see this.
[00:45:27.651 --> 00:45:35.073]  Directly from the leaders of our scientific community, how they're going to kill 90 plus percent of us, and how they're going to start world wars and pandemics to do it.
[00:45:35.073 --> 00:45:42.214]  And then we go, gee, they've got bioweapons labs in Africa, and gee, they admit they created airborne Ebola to kill black people.
[00:45:42.214 --> 00:45:44.475]  Gee, could this be that?
[00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:48.335]  Oh, how dare you, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, crazy man.
[00:45:48.335 --> 00:45:49.856]  It just doesn't work anymore.
[00:45:49.856 --> 00:45:51.876]  People understand what's going on.
[00:45:51.876 --> 00:45:55.957]  Paul Joseph Watson, what else are you working on right now for InfoWars.com?
[00:45:57.608 --> 00:46:03.191]  I'm thinking that I probably should actually make a video about this academic paper because I was going to do so at the time.
[00:46:03.191 --> 00:46:06.413]  Then it got no attention when I put the article out, so I just dropped it, but I mean...
[00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:15.297]  The fact about it is that, again, Ehrlich has been proven wildly inaccurate time and time again, yet he's still cited as the supreme authority.
[00:46:15.297 --> 00:46:22.701]  If you actually look at the population demographics, even in places like Brazil and India, they're starting to gradually fall.
[00:46:22.701 --> 00:46:30.387]  Of course, in many European countries, like Russia, the governments are literally begging people to have children, giving them financial incentives.
[00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:36.971]  And actually, after 2050, the major problem is going to be underpopulation, and all the sober evidence points to that.
[00:46:36.991 --> 00:46:46.999]  Yeah, and then you've got people like Ehrlich who control Holdren in the White House saying that no, it's going to get completely out of control despite the fact that he's been proven wrong time and time again.
[00:46:46.999 --> 00:46:56.065]  And they're saying we need a global one-child policy and most people are never going to see this because you have to pay $10 and it's a dry academic, you know, 16-page paper.
[00:46:56.065 --> 00:46:56.786]  They're not going to read it.
[00:46:56.886 --> 00:47:02.150]  Well, it's a regurgitation of what they said thousands of times, and the word is getting out on it, Paul.
[00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:06.954]  That's why people weren't that interested in your paper, because it's like, oh, the elite want to kill everybody and have the global government to do it?
[00:47:06.954 --> 00:47:07.774]  Oh, I already know that.
[00:47:07.774 --> 00:47:08.415]  Let's move on.
[00:47:08.415 --> 00:47:15.520]  Yeah, we need to get the word out on this, folks, and warn people, because that's what the fluoride and the GMO and all of it is about.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.862]  They're doing it to everybody.
[00:47:17.862 --> 00:47:22.325]  They just soft-kill Westerners because they want you to waddle off and die 20 years later
[00:47:23.516 --> 00:47:26.278]  But in Africa and places, they hit them and hit them hard.
[00:47:26.278 --> 00:47:29.000]  And some of you are like, well, there are too many people.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.123]  You can't morally get away from that, that it'll come back on you as well.
[00:47:33.123 --> 00:47:35.445]  It is total evil.
[00:47:35.445 --> 00:47:36.946]  It's all about control.
[00:47:36.946 --> 00:47:40.848]  If they just industrialize these countries, they'll stop having as many kids.
[00:47:40.848 --> 00:47:43.590]  All the numbers, all the graphs, all the actuaries show it.
[00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.291]  Paul Watson, thank you so much.
[00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:46.292]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:47:46.292 --> 00:47:48.214]  And speaking of Ebola, we do have
[00:47:49.074 --> 00:48:04.718]  One of the global experts on bioweapons, Steven Hatfield, Dr. Steven Hatfield, you know that name, they tried to pin the anthrax attacks on him, and then three other people, but they finally killed the fifth Patsy, so he couldn't talk, but they weren't able to get Hatfield.
[00:48:04.718 --> 00:48:06.758]  He's going to be coming on to talk Ebola with us.
[00:48:06.758 --> 00:48:13.280]  I want to go to your phone calls the next two segments, Wayne, Rob, Red Diamond, Woody, and Joe, and others.
[00:48:14.548 --> 00:48:17.310]  So be ready, I'm going to go right to you after the break.
[00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:30.020]  Your take on the election, your take on Ebola, your take on Forbes saying they went to the press conference and they admitted that there's a cover-up of what appear to be Ebola cases to shut up about it and then let the people be disappeared.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:30.520]  What's next?
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.063]  Start arresting reporters and disappearing us and you'll just go along with that?
[00:48:34.063 --> 00:48:37.245]  What's wrong with you people?
[00:48:37.245 --> 00:48:38.206]  Do your job.
[00:48:38.206 --> 00:48:40.127]  This is not North Korea.
[00:48:40.127 --> 00:48:40.988]  It will be soon.
[00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.916]  If this continues, what is your problem?
[00:48:46.916 --> 00:48:48.398]  Admit Ebola cases.
[00:48:48.398 --> 00:48:49.620]  Let people know.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.322]  Then they'll have confidence.
[00:48:51.322 --> 00:48:56.209]  When you cover up, it causes lack of confidence.
[00:48:56.209 --> 00:48:58.833]  But it's a culture of lying about everything.
[00:49:01.974 --> 00:49:13.263]  Alright, before we go any further, ladies and gentlemen, I personally am getting my body's natural defenses ready and up to snuff with sunshine, filtered water, non-GMO, exercise.

[00:51:03.117 --> 00:51:03.878]  No joke.
[00:51:03.878 --> 00:51:06.579]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[00:51:06.579 --> 00:51:09.180]  And if House Bill H.R.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:13.683]  5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.

[00:52:00.174 --> 00:52:02.996]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:02.996 --> 00:52:08.119]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:08.119 --> 00:52:16.245]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:16.245 --> 00:52:20.767]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:20.767 --> 00:52:24.590]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:30.674]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:30.674 --> 00:52:33.856]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:33.856 --> 00:52:39.220]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:47.365]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:52:47.365 --> 00:52:47.585]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:52:55.390 --> 00:53:02.632]  Americans, it's the end of the world as you've known it.
[00:53:02.632 --> 00:53:05.613]  Hi, this is Larry Criss, the baby boomer back at Plan.com.
[00:53:05.613 --> 00:53:11.155]  And right now, if you're a middle-class American, you probably feel like you're being squeezed out of existence.
[00:53:11.155 --> 00:53:19.038]  As incomes drop, food prices rise, and job markets remain abysmal, how will you provide the cash flow you and your family need to survive?
[00:53:19.038 --> 00:53:22.839]  Every generation knows that the old plan of trading 40 hours a week for 40 years
[00:53:23.459 --> 00:53:26.322]  Then retiring to a golf course is a thing of the past.
[00:53:26.322 --> 00:53:33.108]  But while the traditional concept of retirement is fading, a new and exciting time of re-inspirement is emerging.
[00:53:33.108 --> 00:53:44.959]  You can find out how friends of mine from 25 to 85 years old have learned the secrets of creating cash flow and freedom they never dreamed possible in my free special report at babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[00:53:45.239 --> 00:53:51.980]  Yes, it is the end of the world as we've known it, but you'll be re-inspired by my special report at babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:52.440]  Call 800-704-4117.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:52.781]  That's 800-704-4117.
[00:54:16.894 --> 00:54:24.798]  Headline on Infowars.com, Obama caught ordering press to cover up Ebola-like cases.
[00:54:24.798 --> 00:54:28.580]  Obama vows to proceed with executive amnesty for illegal immigrants.
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.521]  What landslide?
[00:54:29.521 --> 00:54:35.284]  90-year-old World War II vet charged for feeding homeless again.
[00:54:35.284 --> 00:54:38.206]  Obama seeks new authorization for war in the Middle East.
[00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:42.932]  The economy, the largest superpower on the planet, is collapsing right now.
[00:54:42.932 --> 00:54:50.617]  Finland warns Europe that they are at the gates of a new Cold War in the wake of Russian military activity.
[00:54:50.617 --> 00:54:52.899]  That's just some of the news.
[00:54:52.899 --> 00:54:56.762]  Max Slavo, who writes great articles, says election results, who's going to change?
[00:54:56.762 --> 00:55:00.925]  What's going to change is only who is going to screw you, not whether you'll get screwed.
[00:55:00.925 --> 00:55:07.750]  I don't totally disagree with that, but if we hold the Republicans' feet to the fire now, and there's no honeymoon period,
[00:55:08.686 --> 00:55:10.448]  Good morning Alex, good to speak with you.
[00:55:10.448 --> 00:55:11.769]  I've got a little idea here.
[00:55:33.976 --> 00:55:37.117]  You know, they flipped this thing on its head.
[00:55:37.117 --> 00:55:38.937]  Well, why can't we do the same thing?
[00:55:38.937 --> 00:55:53.921]  You know, a simple example would be, let's have us a million mass march, and instead of the police surrounding us as we march down the street, how about we surround the police and show our support for them?
[00:55:53.921 --> 00:55:55.841]  That we will stand behind them.
[00:55:56.451 --> 00:56:00.633]  You know, let's get out of our paradigm box of following the rules that they're setting.
[00:56:00.633 --> 00:56:01.013]  I agree.
[00:56:01.013 --> 00:56:06.476]  They always want everybody fighting with each other, instead of just agreeing on the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:56:06.476 --> 00:56:08.757]  Yeah, let's brainstorm this thing out, you know.
[00:56:08.757 --> 00:56:18.141]  What can we do different that doesn't fit their paradigm to show them that we are on the march?
[00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:24.024]  Well, Robert David Steele talks about trigger events, and so does folks like Steve Pichennik.
[00:56:24.847 --> 00:56:28.790]  Well, I ought to get Pecheneg and Steele on together and talk about trigger events.
[00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:34.373]  But instead of having a bad trigger event, what's a good trigger event to bring America together to rediscover liberty?
[00:56:34.373 --> 00:56:35.014]  Great points.
[00:56:35.014 --> 00:56:43.059]  We'll try to brainstorm that one day and have open phones on the subject of what are stunts we can pull to try to jumpstart America's heart.
[00:56:43.059 --> 00:56:44.740]  I think that's already starting to happen.
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.662]  Red Diamond in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:56:47.662 --> 00:56:47.982]  Go ahead.
[00:56:49.266 --> 00:56:52.388]  Hey Alex, talk about the Ebola for a minute.
[00:56:52.388 --> 00:57:00.273]  Now, we got the borders wide open and the government's response by not shutting down the international flights and stuff.
[00:57:00.273 --> 00:57:12.520]  All they're trying to do, in my opinion, is just wait for something to happen so people will stay in their homes and then it's going to have an economic impact on the region where the outbreaks occur.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:13.680]  And I think that's what they want.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.822]  And then they're going to come after the guns when they know everybody's at their houses.
[00:57:16.822 --> 00:57:17.783]  Is there any truth to that?
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.582]  We've got to look at every option, every outcome, and that's one of the big ones.
[00:57:22.582 --> 00:57:27.944]  So there's something behind this Ebola, and the defaults stand down, and the defaults being ignored.
[00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:30.105]  There's clearly something bigger going on.
[00:57:30.105 --> 00:57:32.246]  There's clearly a cover-up of Ebola cases.
[00:57:32.246 --> 00:57:36.789]  That's even in Forbes now, that they're ordered to cover it up, and they're complying.
[00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:41.931]  So, that is just sensationally big, that they're covering that up.
[00:57:41.931 --> 00:57:45.473]  I mean, it's one thing, like, the press used to agree to not talk about presidents and their girlfriends.
[00:57:46.141 --> 00:57:48.842]  Quite frankly, that's okay, because that's somebody's private life.
[00:57:48.842 --> 00:57:49.782]  I don't want to know about it.
[00:57:49.782 --> 00:57:51.883]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:57:51.883 --> 00:57:55.064]  But we do need to know if the President's taking bribes.
[00:57:55.064 --> 00:57:57.605]  We do need to know if the President's spying on the press.
[00:57:57.605 --> 00:58:00.226]  We do need to know if the President's shipping guns into Mexico.
[00:58:00.226 --> 00:58:04.087]  We do need to know if they're ordering the press to cover up Ebola cases.
[00:58:04.087 --> 00:58:07.508]  That is criminal.
[00:58:07.508 --> 00:58:09.709]  That is a dictatorship forming right there.
[00:58:11.675 --> 00:58:15.424]  I listen to your show every day and I hear about the power bills going up.
[00:58:15.424 --> 00:58:18.452]  My power bills doubled in the last two years.
[00:58:18.452 --> 00:58:19.334]  I'm on disability.
[00:58:19.334 --> 00:58:19.935]  I'm a veteran.
[00:58:21.115 --> 00:58:21.616]  What do they do?
[00:58:21.616 --> 00:58:23.517]  They want us in the streets?
[00:58:23.517 --> 00:58:25.919]  Or they want us in our houses?
[00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:32.125]  In the first four years they shut down, according to Forbes again, 400 plus power stations, coal power.
[00:58:32.125 --> 00:58:34.467]  They've shut down another 300 in the last two.
[00:58:34.467 --> 00:58:36.909]  They're about to shut a thousand down.
[00:58:36.909 --> 00:58:38.290]  So it'll quadruple your prices.
[00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:39.831]  Yeah, they want you in the streets.
[00:58:39.831 --> 00:58:40.272]  On welfare.
[00:58:50.427 --> 00:59:00.094]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:59:00.094 --> 00:59:10.021]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:59:10.021 --> 00:59:12.943]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:59:13.063 --> 00:59:13.203]  I think?
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:06.192 --> 01:00:11.035]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.035 --> 01:00:12.616]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.616 --> 01:00:14.157]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.157 --> 01:00:18.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.423]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.218 --> 01:00:37.800]  We just had a caller, if you joined us, saying, hey, my power bill's doubled in the last two years.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.602]  It's no secret the energy councils are on record.
[01:00:41.602 --> 01:00:53.128]  There's been roughly about a 75% increase in electrical-generated power in the last six years, mainly because of 400, 500, 700 power plants have been shut down.
[01:00:53.128 --> 01:01:01.033]  They're set to shut down another 1,000 under EPA regulations, because they've listed water vapor and carbon dioxide as poison.
[01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:03.751]  Nothing else comes out of the stacks now.
[01:01:03.751 --> 01:01:05.311]  They're totally clean.
[01:01:05.311 --> 01:01:13.435]  And so, it doesn't matter whether you're getting it from hydroelectric or solar or wherever, there's less power generation, so the prices go up.
[01:01:13.435 --> 01:01:15.636]  Alright, let's go to Woody in Washington.
[01:01:15.636 --> 01:01:16.397]  You're on the air.
[01:01:16.397 --> 01:01:17.317]  Go ahead.
[01:01:17.317 --> 01:01:19.858]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:19.858 --> 01:01:30.263]  I just wanted to say, if you remember the movie Blazing Saddles, the character that played the Attorney General, Harvey Korman, I think him and Holder look a lot alike.
[01:01:31.141 --> 01:01:34.724]  You know, I have never seen Blazing Saddles, except for a few clips of it.
[01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:38.227]  Doesn't that have the comedian in it?
[01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:45.513]  Yeah, well, it had a host of comedians, and Harvey Karman played a great Attorney General that was just a real scoundrel.
[01:01:45.513 --> 01:01:49.196]  Is that the one with Billy Crystal?
[01:01:49.196 --> 01:01:49.636]  No.
[01:01:49.636 --> 01:01:50.077]  No.
[01:01:50.077 --> 01:01:51.018]  No.
[01:01:51.018 --> 01:01:51.138]  No.
[01:01:52.501 --> 01:01:55.362]  Oh, he did a knockoff or something on a Western.
[01:01:55.362 --> 01:01:57.262]  Blazing Saddles!
[01:01:57.262 --> 01:01:58.362]  Yeah, Blazing Saddles.
[01:01:58.362 --> 01:02:05.984]  Anyways, from a historical perspective, I've been reading a lot of Jefferson's biography recently by John Meacham.
[01:02:05.984 --> 01:02:10.465]  And, you know, our forefathers, they never lost sight of who they were dealing with, ever.
[01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:12.485]  And that's where we've gotten off the track.
[01:02:12.485 --> 01:02:17.406]  We, as a country, we've lost sight of who the real scoundrels and villains are.
[01:02:17.406 --> 01:02:20.207]  And we went to sleep, and now we're waking up, and we're in this nightmare.
[01:02:21.149 --> 01:02:23.050]  And all we got to do is go to history.
[01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:24.570]  Look what they did to the American Indians.
[01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:28.992]  They gave them blankets with smallpox and, you know.
[01:02:28.992 --> 01:02:30.292]  And here's a history piece.
[01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:39.336]  In New York City, there was a typhus outbreak during the Civil War that was suspected that the Confederates did.
[01:02:39.336 --> 01:02:40.416]  So there's a lot of history.
[01:02:40.416 --> 01:02:41.236]  Just look at the history.
[01:02:41.236 --> 01:02:42.337]  You'll see what's coming our way.
[01:02:43.288 --> 01:02:51.311]  Well, you made a great point, Woody, about the whole situation with biologicals being used as weapons, but also about the founders.
[01:02:51.311 --> 01:02:56.893]  I've read the letters and works written by Jefferson and by Washington.
[01:02:56.893 --> 01:03:02.655]  They were mad about rigged economies and ultra-rich that wouldn't let other people compete in the market.
[01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:06.196]  The whole renaissance in Europe was about trying to stop that.
[01:03:06.196 --> 01:03:11.378]  And that's what we're under now is crony capitalism versus true freedom.
[01:03:12.645 --> 01:03:20.628]  And if we ever just get basic, true freedom, we'll all be so rich, our problem will be our kids being spoiled brats.
[01:03:20.628 --> 01:03:21.488]  And that's what's happened.
[01:03:21.488 --> 01:03:26.149]  We got so rich off freedom that we now are a bunch of spoiled brats.
[01:03:26.149 --> 01:03:28.750]  We are the spoiled brats.
[01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:33.732]  And where our kids are even bigger spoiled brats, collectively, we've got to change that.
[01:03:33.732 --> 01:03:36.193]  But historically first, the bottom has to fall out.
[01:03:36.193 --> 01:03:37.633]  Thank you for the call, Woody.
[01:03:37.633 --> 01:03:39.234]  Joe in Georgia, thanks for calling.
[01:03:39.234 --> 01:03:39.734]  You're on the air.
[01:03:40.595 --> 01:03:42.717]  Big ol' racist.
[01:03:42.717 --> 01:03:43.237]  That's right.
[01:03:43.237 --> 01:03:43.858]  You are.
[01:03:43.858 --> 01:03:45.399]  You're a race baiter.
[01:03:45.399 --> 01:03:48.421]  You're just trying to stir things up.
[01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:51.223]  No, but really, I love your show.
[01:03:51.223 --> 01:03:54.506]  First time caller, man.
[01:03:54.506 --> 01:03:59.650]  I just wanted to echo what you're saying to let people know it's all true.
[01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:00.971]  All of this is true.
[01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:09.237]  I work in the news industry and we're ordered weekly basis to pull stories that's coming out of New York.
[01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:10.995]  Take that.
[01:04:10.995 --> 01:04:12.837]  Take that out of your shot.
[01:04:12.837 --> 01:04:14.639]  You don't want to run that.
[01:04:14.639 --> 01:04:20.746]  And it's frustrating because you ask, you know, how cowardly is this country?
[01:04:20.746 --> 01:04:23.269]  I ask myself that a lot.
[01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:29.696]  Something big's got to happen because there's there's glimmers of something coming together.
[01:04:29.696 --> 01:04:31.498]  But as a whole, people
[01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:34.911]  People don't know what the hell's going on.
[01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:01.608]  The experts are clear.
[01:05:01.608 --> 01:05:08.733]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:05:08.733 --> 01:05:14.997]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[01:05:14.997 --> 01:05:18.600]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:22.942]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:05:22.942 --> 01:05:28.265]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:05:28.265 --> 01:05:29.265]  Not our iodine.
[01:05:29.265 --> 01:05:33.087]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:05:33.087 --> 01:05:35.628]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:05:55.639 --> 01:05:56.660]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:06:16.457 --> 01:06:21.106]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:06:21.106 --> 01:06:25.174]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:06:25.174 --> 01:06:27.298]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:06:29.597 --> 01:06:34.198]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:06:34.198 --> 01:06:38.000]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.260]  Others don't.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.401]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:06:41.401 --> 01:06:43.181]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:46.062]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:07:12.371 --> 01:07:23.239]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't

[01:07:29.203 --> 01:07:39.609]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[01:07:39.609 --> 01:07:50.076]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[01:07:50.416 --> 01:08:02.749]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[01:08:02.749 --> 01:08:04.912]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.912 --> 01:08:08.235]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.346 --> 01:08:15.667]  What landslide!
[01:08:15.667 --> 01:08:20.611]  Obama threatens vetoes and executive orders including immigration reform this year.
[01:08:20.611 --> 01:08:25.855]  Which just means legalizing all the illegals he's already incentivized to come into the country and get free welfare.
[01:08:25.855 --> 01:08:31.179]  Really an amazing act of tyranny we're seeing.
[01:08:31.179 --> 01:08:36.543]  Also in the election, CNN exit poll shows Republicans won big among full-time workers.
[01:08:38.084 --> 01:08:51.113]  And college attendees showing the youth are becoming more libertarian, and again it was a libertarian movement, CNS News is reporting, that breathed life into the dying dinosaur Republican carcass.
[01:08:51.113 --> 01:09:04.603]  So it's not an endorsement of the Republican establishment, this major political realignment, it's America waking up the collectivism and insider politics and identity politics and race politics is a fraud.
[01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:09.554]  And that's exactly what the new black senator, Scott, is saying.
[01:09:09.554 --> 01:09:10.935]  Stop the race baiting.
[01:09:10.935 --> 01:09:16.520]  And for that, he gets an F grade from the NAACP.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.283]  Pretty amazing to see all of that unfolding.
[01:09:19.283 --> 01:09:25.068]  Now, we've got a very special guest on, Steven Hatfield.
[01:09:25.068 --> 01:09:30.814]  For the balance of the hour, towards the end of the hour, we will take some calls from Joe and others that are calling in on Ebola.
[01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:38.772]  Specifically, I don't say Ebola on purpose, it's a Freudian slip, Ebola.
[01:09:38.772 --> 01:09:50.935]  Steven Hatfield is an American physician, virologist, and bioweapons expert, one of the top in the world, who underwent what was considered by many a trial by the media, and with great toll on his personal, professional life.
[01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:54.816]  After eight months of pressure from the media and amateur detectives, the U.S.
[01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:56.176]  Department of Justice identified
[01:09:56.716 --> 01:09:59.758]  The former government scientist is a person of interest in the investigation.
[01:09:59.758 --> 01:10:01.539]  That's not why he's on today.
[01:10:01.539 --> 01:10:03.180]  The 2001 attacks.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:11.725]  He was later completely exonerated and Hatfield later sued and won $5.8 million from the federal government.
[01:10:11.725 --> 01:10:14.127]  They also tried to burn a bunch of other patsies.
[01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:15.507]  It was bizarre.
[01:10:15.507 --> 01:10:17.128]  Of course, we really know what happened with that.
[01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:20.070]  Wasn't somebody rogue, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:22.230]  We're not going to cover that much today.
[01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:29.033]  As of 2014, Stephen Hatfield is consulting to African countries on Ebola containment and prevention.
[01:10:29.033 --> 01:10:38.776]  In his detailed report on the Ebola epidemic, made available by the Atlantic Monthly, he supports the introduction of stronger quarantine measures to protect the United States from infection.
[01:10:40.123 --> 01:10:42.004]  He's one of the global leading experts.
[01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:44.264]  He's worked a lot in Africa as well.
[01:10:44.264 --> 01:10:48.226]  He's advising the African countries, one of the top advisors to their governments.
[01:10:48.226 --> 01:10:50.646]  And so, again, we're very honored to have him join us.
[01:10:50.646 --> 01:11:02.390]  And dovetailed with all this, Forbes is reporting, and we're linked to it on Infowars.com, that Obama has ordered the media to cover up new Ebola cases, or what they believe are Ebola cases, in the country.
[01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:05.191]  And we've interviewed on-air, by name, medical doctor and others.
[01:11:06.041 --> 01:11:11.382]  Border Patrol that they're saying, no, people that we're told have Ebola are being disappeared.
[01:11:11.382 --> 01:11:15.163]  So it appears to be a cover-up, but regardless people are being disappeared.
[01:11:15.163 --> 01:11:20.065]  So we've got the expert on to be able to break down every facet of this.
[01:11:20.065 --> 01:11:23.466]  He's an associate of Doctors for Disaster Preparedness.
[01:11:23.466 --> 01:11:27.607]  They have an amazing website, DDP online.
[01:11:27.607 --> 01:11:31.568]  That's DDP online dot O-R-G.
[01:11:31.568 --> 01:11:33.428]  We're going to tweet that out.
[01:11:33.428 --> 01:11:35.069]  We have one of the top
[01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:42.074]  Doctors, one of the top global experts on Ebola, giving us the inside breakdown on what's happening.
[01:11:42.074 --> 01:11:44.015]  Dr. Hadfield, thanks for coming on.
[01:11:44.015 --> 01:11:45.617]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:11:45.617 --> 01:11:46.998]  Good day to you.
[01:11:46.998 --> 01:11:48.759]  So much is happening.
[01:11:48.759 --> 01:11:49.960]  Where should we begin?
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:55.084]  Probably to look at this entire outbreak.
[01:11:55.084 --> 01:12:01.028]  And by the way, there are a lot of people knowledgeable about Ebola.
[01:12:01.028 --> 01:12:02.910]  This disease has been recognized since 1975.
[01:12:05.482 --> 01:12:24.555]  And the earlier generation of infectious disease specialists that worked with this recognized that there was some non-understanding of this virus with respect to transmission or potential for transmission, and they classified this as a biosafety level 4 threat.
[01:12:24.555 --> 01:12:27.437]  This requires the highest level of biocontainment.
[01:12:27.437 --> 01:12:33.862]  This is where you wear the spacesuits that are under positive pressure, and you work inside a room that is negative pressure.
[01:12:34.921 --> 01:12:38.842]  So nothing can get to your skin or your mucous membrane.
[01:12:38.842 --> 01:12:42.342]  And you're quite safe under these type of conditions.
[01:12:42.342 --> 01:12:50.704]  Because of field expedience and requirements, Ebola in Africa is being treated as a biosafety level 3.
[01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:50.924]  Sure.
[01:12:50.924 --> 01:12:52.404]  Doc, speak up just a little bit for us.
[01:12:52.404 --> 01:12:53.004]  Thanks.
[01:12:53.004 --> 01:12:54.164]  Yeah.
[01:12:54.164 --> 01:12:59.485]  Ebola in Africa is being treated as a biosafety level 3 infection.
[01:12:59.485 --> 01:13:03.586]  And we're doing the same in this country under these protocols.
[01:13:04.625 --> 01:13:11.048]  There's still some things we don't know about the virus, which is a bit concerning.
[01:13:11.048 --> 01:13:24.773]  The crux of the problem is, is that as the human species has expanded, we've enroached onto natural areas throughout the world in our ever-increasing numbers.
[01:13:24.773 --> 01:13:28.254]  And this leads to the whole concept of emerging infectious diseases.
[01:13:28.254 --> 01:13:32.656]  And we're getting almost one new infection that we haven't seen before in humans.
[01:13:34.255 --> 01:13:36.256]  Almost every year now.
[01:13:36.256 --> 01:13:40.897]  So the Ebola outbreak is just the tip of the problem.
[01:13:40.897 --> 01:13:46.018]  And it's been interesting to watch how the United States responded to this.
[01:13:46.018 --> 01:13:54.200]  Because I can guarantee you there's worse things than Ebola out in nature that we don't have any idea about yet.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:59.001]  So it's very important to make sure that we have a good
[01:14:00.157 --> 01:14:06.208]  Public health service, robust, and it's able to handle these unusual types of dangerous outbreaks.
[01:14:09.921 --> 01:14:17.083]  Specifically, we've seen Army reports saying that in cold weather, Ebola is essentially airborne, can live on surfaces for weeks.
[01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:21.444]  Then we see the New York Times and CNN saying, is it going airborne?
[01:14:21.444 --> 01:14:24.904]  Reportedly, it would only be infectious for three or four days previously.
[01:14:24.904 --> 01:14:29.025]  Now they say it doesn't show up for 21, maybe 70 in sperm.
[01:14:29.025 --> 01:14:32.026]  From researching Ebola as being a top bioweapons expert,
[01:14:32.526 --> 01:14:35.067]  Well, for the last... to answer your question directly and then expound upon it.
[01:14:56.977 --> 01:15:10.383]  The data that I'm getting back to me is that this virus is replicating to a very high level in humans, the Zaire strain of Ebola that's part of the present outbreak.
[01:15:10.383 --> 01:15:17.326]  Also, this is an RNA virus, and these are notoriously susceptible to mutation.
[01:15:17.326 --> 01:15:24.849]  With respect to the aerosol transmission, we've known for four years now that both Ebola and its relative, the Marburg virus,
[01:15:25.962 --> 01:15:32.783]  Uh, can survive in an aerosol in the dark, uh, to detectable levels for at least one and a half hours.
[01:15:32.783 --> 01:15:36.124]  That is, if it's not in direct sunlight.
[01:15:36.124 --> 01:15:39.004]  Um, aerosols are generated by a variety of things.
[01:15:39.004 --> 01:15:50.766]  Coughing, sneezing, invasive medical procedures, uh, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing a toilet, uh, a lot of common laboratory equipment that's used in a medical laboratory.
[01:15:50.766 --> 01:15:55.147]  Uh, these are capable of producing aerosol droplets in different size ranges.
[01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:06.373]  In traditional outbreaks of Ebola in Africa, airborne transmission has not been an overwhelming feature.
[01:16:06.373 --> 01:16:14.318]  It's been person-to-person contact or contact with contaminated fluids.
[01:16:14.318 --> 01:16:27.326]  When we're in the United States and an ambulance crew is trying to transport a patient with an unknown fever to a hospital, it's very common to generate aerosols and vomit and this type of thing.
[01:16:28.824 --> 01:16:36.995]  And my concern is patients that don't realize they have this disease or EMS responders that don't realize they have this.
[01:16:36.995 --> 01:16:41.661]  And then secondary transmission to that.
[01:16:42.861 --> 01:16:50.203]  Well, Dr. Steven Hatfield is our guest, one of the top bioweapons experts out there, and he's advising African countries on what's going on.
[01:16:50.203 --> 01:16:51.103]  We see some U.N.
[01:16:51.103 --> 01:16:55.805]  models saying 1.4 million by January that could contract it.
[01:16:55.805 --> 01:16:59.126]  I know you've called for stricter controls.
[01:16:59.126 --> 01:17:03.247]  I follow the news, but I'm not an expert like you, but I do interview the experts, doctor.
[01:17:03.247 --> 01:17:05.948]  Previously, they would put people on ships or
[01:17:06.568 --> 01:17:10.350]  You know, make them get out of the hot zone in Africa for 21 days before they brought them in.
[01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:13.752]  They wouldn't stick Ebola patients, like you said, at level 4.
[01:17:13.752 --> 01:17:17.554]  Inside hospitals, level 2 or 3.
[01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:21.256]  Why are they not doing the default things they did previously?
[01:17:21.256 --> 01:17:26.900]  A. B. Why are they lying to people and saying there's no threat it'll spread over here?
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.440]  Or am I wrong about that?
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:33.964]  What do you think, pulling back from this as a scientist, just as an American citizen, as a family man,
[01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:36.485]  Things don't seem right here.
[01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:38.606]  What's really going on?
[01:17:38.606 --> 01:17:39.107]  I don't know.
[01:17:39.107 --> 01:17:41.228]  It seems politics are driving things.
[01:17:41.228 --> 01:17:49.853]  Now, this epidemic in Africa is, I think, I don't think we're going to see these catastrophic predictions over there.
[01:17:49.853 --> 01:17:50.574]  Good.
[01:17:50.574 --> 01:17:53.515]  We have a very good infrastructure here.
[01:17:53.515 --> 01:17:58.318]  I mean, you can't imagine the conditions in Africa in some places.
[01:17:58.318 --> 01:18:01.180]  So the ability to control this thing
[01:18:02.269 --> 01:18:04.790]  Care, I think, is very, very good.
[01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:08.211]  This isn't one to panic about.
[01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:13.832]  But it does portray some disturbing questions.
[01:18:13.832 --> 01:18:22.035]  We've spent $120 billion on biological defense and emerging diseases over the last two decades.
[01:18:22.035 --> 01:18:25.776]  And we can't seem to handle one case of Ebola.
[01:18:27.993 --> 01:18:34.876]  Flu is probably our really biggest worry, an avian hybrid flu.
[01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:50.381]  And for this, the United States spent some 47 million dollars in supplemental funding to the Department of Health and Human Services.
[01:18:50.381 --> 01:18:53.242]  In a recent GAO investigation,
[01:18:54.437 --> 01:18:59.020]  Yeah, it's essentially this money was wasted.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:04.884]  DHS spent about nine and a half million on protective equipment since 2006.
[01:19:04.884 --> 01:19:10.608]  6.7 for antiviral drugs, which by the way, don't work.
[01:19:10.608 --> 01:19:16.732]  And our stockpile of Tamiflu and the other drug has expired.
[01:19:16.732 --> 01:19:18.734]  There's been no controls to monitor.
[01:19:18.734 --> 01:19:21.976]  There was no rationality to this purchasing.
[01:19:22.808 --> 01:19:26.595]  They bought about 5,000 bottles of hand sanitizer.
[01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:30.101]  84% of this has expired.
[01:19:30.101 --> 01:19:32.305]  So basically a giant boondoggle.
[01:19:32.305 --> 01:19:32.505]  Yeah.
[01:19:33.763 --> 01:19:38.885]  Stay there, Dr. Steven Hatfield is our guest, M.D., one of the top bioweapons experts out there.
[01:19:38.885 --> 01:19:48.668]  When I come back, I want to ask him then, if he talks about an airborne avian flu that's airborne to humans, that being the big threat, what are the big threats?
[01:19:48.668 --> 01:19:52.269]  Mousepox, he talks about all these new emerging diseases.
[01:19:52.269 --> 01:19:58.512]  Let's discuss that, because what this shows us is, when something really bad shows up, they're just going to leave the borders wide open.
[01:19:58.512 --> 01:19:59.172]  And why?
[01:19:59.997 --> 01:20:05.860]  This winter, next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.781]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[01:20:07.781 --> 01:20:16.105]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel can be safely stored with your other supplies for many years and works in any gas-powered vehicle or backup generator.
[01:20:16.105 --> 01:20:21.808]  With the bitterly cold temperatures predicted for this winter, now is the best time to stock up on spare fuel.
[01:20:21.808 --> 01:20:24.410]  So, go to GetSpareFuel.com.
[01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:26.511]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.
[01:20:26.511 --> 01:20:27.772]  GetSpareFuel.com.
[01:20:29.788 --> 01:20:32.871]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[01:20:32.871 --> 01:20:34.672]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[01:20:34.672 --> 01:20:37.154]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[01:20:37.154 --> 01:20:38.755]  And your rights are at risk.
[01:20:38.755 --> 01:20:43.099]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.
[01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:45.280]  KD Armor is standing up for you.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.403]  We offer the most affordable level 3 body armor on the market.
[01:20:48.403 --> 01:20:52.846]  KD Level 3 Armor withstands pistol and rifle hits up to 7.62 NATO.

[01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:58.631]  Come and take it.
[01:20:59.151 --> 01:21:03.813]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[01:21:03.813 --> 01:21:16.159]  This combined with several other unidentified viruses have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:26.123]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell

[01:22:58.402 --> 01:23:01.225]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:01.225 --> 01:23:06.351]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:23:06.351 --> 01:23:14.180]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:18.984]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:23:18.984 --> 01:23:22.968]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:22.968 --> 01:23:28.913]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:28.913 --> 01:23:32.076]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:32.076 --> 01:23:37.221]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:06.623]  This show is documented.
[01:24:06.623 --> 01:24:10.145]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:13.387]  That's right, don't worry.
[01:24:13.387 --> 01:24:16.929]  We start claiming something or talking about something, we give you the source.
[01:24:16.929 --> 01:24:18.390]  About 99% of the time.
[01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:19.591]  Or over-speculate and we'll tell ya.
[01:24:20.191 --> 01:24:22.073]  We're just speculating.
[01:24:22.073 --> 01:24:25.877]  You can make the decision yourself, just like we're doing, off what you think's going on.
[01:24:25.877 --> 01:24:36.268]  Dr. Stephen Hatfield is our guest, medical doctor, one of the top bioweapons experts out there on record, and you can read big articles with his analysis in the Atlantic Monthly, you name it.
[01:24:36.268 --> 01:24:43.115]  Just by googling his name, you're going to ddponline.org, Doctors for Disaster Preparedness.
[01:24:43.895 --> 01:24:45.177]  And he joins us right now.
[01:24:45.177 --> 01:24:47.560]  We'll be taking some of your calls coming up for him at 800-259-9231.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:47.640]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.082]  Coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:49.082 --> 01:24:51.845]  Doc, this is your sports segment, so get right back into it.
[01:24:58.266 --> 01:25:13.516]  I see them publish the design of mouse box that they say is super deadly, worse than Ebola, correct me if I'm wrong, or universities openly working at BioShield to create new airborne avian flu, claiming they want to know how to treat it.
[01:25:13.516 --> 01:25:25.544]  But again, I'm no rocket scientist or virologist like you, but it seems if you've got level four stuff going on in Galveston where it gets hit by a hurricane and
[01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:28.791]  Things seem so flimsy now.
[01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:36.055]  It's only a matter of time till the bio-shield system ends up releasing some nightmare pathogen.
[01:25:36.055 --> 01:25:39.057]  Or do you think it's going to come out of the jungles of somewhere?
[01:25:39.057 --> 01:25:41.138]  You talk about all these emerging things.
[01:25:41.138 --> 01:25:42.579]  What is the big threat?
[01:25:42.579 --> 01:25:46.341]  What keeps you awake at night?
[01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:47.682]  Mother Nature.
[01:25:47.682 --> 01:25:49.863]  These labs, I mean you've got C.J.
[01:25:49.863 --> 01:25:54.846]  Peters down there and he is probably one of the world's experts on Ebola.
[01:25:55.965 --> 01:25:59.307]  Um, he was at CDC Special Pathogens for years.
[01:25:59.307 --> 01:26:06.011]  Sam Ridd, an extremely, extremely knowledgeable scientist and physician.
[01:26:06.011 --> 01:26:07.972]  Just a wonderful guy.
[01:26:07.972 --> 01:26:11.794]  And this stuff isn't getting out of a lab.
[01:26:11.794 --> 01:26:13.154]  Okay, so you're not worried about that.
[01:26:13.154 --> 01:26:13.314]  No.
[01:26:13.314 --> 01:26:15.836]  So you're worried about the jungle?
[01:26:15.836 --> 01:26:18.557]  I'm worried about the jungle.
[01:26:18.557 --> 01:26:23.540]  And right now, there's about five different things going on.
[01:26:24.423 --> 01:26:26.044]  With emerging diseases.
[01:26:26.044 --> 01:26:33.027]  We have this enterovirus that's sickening the children in the Midwest.
[01:26:33.027 --> 01:26:37.748]  We have monkeypox outbreaks in the Kasai Oriental Province.
[01:26:37.748 --> 01:26:39.789]  This has been going on for years.
[01:26:39.789 --> 01:26:44.271]  We have an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
[01:26:44.271 --> 01:26:47.973]  We have the MERS virus in the Mideast.
[01:26:47.973 --> 01:26:50.534]  This is a severe respiratory system virus
[01:26:51.969 --> 01:26:56.711]  Semi-related to the SARS virus that broke out in China and Hong Kong.
[01:26:56.711 --> 01:27:01.953]  We have the chikungunya virus outbreak, and it's almost epidemic in Puerto Rico.
[01:27:01.953 --> 01:27:09.236]  We've had, I think, one primary case in Florida and one secondary mosquito transmitted cases in Florida.
[01:27:09.236 --> 01:27:19.220]  So, these things are just, as our species numbers increase, we have more contact with disrupted, fragmented environments.
[01:27:20.635 --> 01:27:27.159]  And most of these diseases are jumping from animals into humans.
[01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:34.164]  A number of years ago, in the mid-90s, we almost lost all the lions in the Serengeti in Africa.
[01:27:34.164 --> 01:27:44.191]  Distemper, a type of measles virus, jumped from the local wild dogs into the lion population and decimated them.
[01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:55.253]  This is a continuing growing threat of emerging infectious diseases and scientists have been worried about this for 30 years.
[01:27:55.253 --> 01:28:06.239]  So as humans move into these zoological areas, what's causing the viruses and things to jump over into other animals and humans?
[01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:07.519]  Is it just the proximity?
[01:28:07.519 --> 01:28:12.542]  The proximity and the fact that the majority of these are RNA viruses.
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:18.787]  RNA is a type of genetic information that a virus carries.
[01:28:18.787 --> 01:28:22.692]  The other type is the DNA, which a lot of people are familiar with.
[01:28:22.692 --> 01:28:30.241]  But in an RNA virus, every time the virus replicates, it tends to make a mistake in its genetic copy.
[01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:38.823]  So you have, let's say, HIV, a retrovirus, something a bit different.
[01:28:38.823 --> 01:28:43.744]  But you may find up to 27 different strains of HIV in one patient.
[01:28:43.744 --> 01:28:44.445]  Wow.
[01:28:44.445 --> 01:28:46.865]  So it's Mother Nature's way.
[01:28:46.865 --> 01:28:52.707]  And as these viruses mutate, many become non-infectious.
[01:28:52.707 --> 01:28:56.748]  Many lose their capability for viability.
[01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:59.729]  Some acquire, perhaps, new traits.
[01:29:01.458 --> 01:29:06.581]  The Ebola Reston virus is completely non-pathogenic for humans.
[01:29:06.581 --> 01:29:09.863]  You can inject this into yourself and you won't even run a temperature.
[01:29:09.863 --> 01:29:11.744]  It does nothing.
[01:29:11.744 --> 01:29:15.807]  But it's very, very aerosol transmitted.
[01:29:15.807 --> 01:29:18.709]  Now, if you're a pig, it makes you sick.
[01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:21.370]  A lot of these are very species specific.
[01:29:21.370 --> 01:29:25.713]  And then the pig transmits the rest of the Ebola virus to humans.
[01:29:25.713 --> 01:29:28.034]  And again, nothing happens.
[01:29:28.034 --> 01:29:30.696]  So sometimes there's an amplifying host in the middle.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.241]  Let me ask you a question when we come back.
[01:29:33.241 --> 01:29:34.421]  Long sentence coming up.
[01:29:34.421 --> 01:29:43.426]  Is it possible when it goes through a buffer like a pig, would you then get some immunity to other Ebola viruses from the Reston variety?
[01:29:43.426 --> 01:29:46.628]  And we'll ask, is that the one that got out in the lab in 1989?
[01:29:46.628 --> 01:29:47.288]  We'll be back.
[01:29:47.288 --> 01:29:49.589]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.589 --> 01:29:50.990]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:53.511]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.511 --> 01:29:56.193]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.615 --> 01:30:10.281]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:30:10.281 --> 01:30:20.206]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:20.206 --> 01:30:23.128]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:23.328 --> 01:30:23.608]  I think?
[01:30:45.888 --> 01:30:51.233]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:30:51.233 --> 01:30:56.718]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[01:30:56.718 --> 01:30:57.739]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:30:57.739 --> 01:31:02.483]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:31:02.483 --> 01:31:06.167]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:06.987 --> 01:31:11.452]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:31:11.452 --> 01:31:18.780]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:27.850]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:28.050 --> 01:31:33.592]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:31:33.592 --> 01:31:41.194]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[01:32:00.985 --> 01:32:11.550]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:18.014]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:32:18.014 --> 01:32:20.335]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:23.456]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:32:23.456 --> 01:32:30.320]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:34.442]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:34.442 --> 01:32:38.725]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:38.725 --> 01:32:40.506]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:40.506 --> 01:32:45.830]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:48.351]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:32:48.351 --> 01:32:49.512]  But for how long?
[01:32:49.512 --> 01:32:51.713]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:32:51.713 --> 01:32:56.136]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[01:32:56.136 --> 01:32:58.958]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:33:10.057 --> 01:33:14.179]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:14.179 --> 01:33:32.227]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.227 --> 01:33:36.369]  Well, it's not Obama and the Collectivist looting the country's darkest hour.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.903]  No, my friends.
[01:33:40.903 --> 01:33:41.483]  They love it.
[01:33:41.483 --> 01:33:47.050]  He says, I'm going to sign executive orders on your guns, shutting down our power plants, on open borders.
[01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:49.292]  I'm going to do whatever I want.
[01:33:49.292 --> 01:33:50.834]  That's my mandate.
[01:33:50.834 --> 01:33:52.216]  Total arrogance.
[01:33:52.216 --> 01:33:54.959]  We have video clips of it in his statements.
[01:33:54.959 --> 01:33:57.843]  Up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:33:59.707 --> 01:34:09.734]  You know, since I started mentioning the rest in clip from PBS on a Nova piece back in 1990, narrated by Stacy Keach.
[01:34:11.889 --> 01:34:23.492]  Let's play that clip and get one of the top bioweapons medical doctor experts out there, Dr. Steven Hatfield, who trained the FBI, who's a major consultant to African governments right now in their response.
[01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:28.493]  He's saying he doesn't think it'll be as bad as some of the media has been saying, but that there's a terrible response to it.
[01:34:28.493 --> 01:34:29.913]  He's been very critical of that.
[01:34:29.913 --> 01:34:32.974]  I want to get his take on that and take some of your phone calls.
[01:34:32.974 --> 01:34:38.655]  But first, let's play this clip since he was mentioning the Reston strain that they believe did go airborne.
[01:34:38.655 --> 01:34:38.935]  Here it is.
[01:34:40.266 --> 01:34:44.069]  In 1989, Ebola made its way to the U.S.
[01:34:44.069 --> 01:34:46.031]  Residents of this Washington, D.C.
[01:34:46.031 --> 01:34:57.681]  suburb had no idea that one of the world's deadliest viruses had emerged in their midst.
[01:34:57.681 --> 01:35:04.947]  In a primate quarantine unit in Reston, Virginia, monkeys in one of the holding rooms suddenly began to die.
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:23.692]  Secretly, a military team entered the quarantine unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room.
[01:35:23.692 --> 01:35:28.856]  The crisis heightened as monkeys began to die in a different room.
[01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:31.958]  It appeared that the virus was moving through the ventilating system.
[01:35:33.371 --> 01:35:39.616]  In response, the military killed all 400 monkeys, ending the outbreak.
[01:35:39.616 --> 01:35:40.517]  Alright.
[01:35:40.517 --> 01:35:45.020]  This new strain of Ebola had shown the potential to spread through the air.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.683]  Let's go back to Dr. Steven Hadfield.
[01:35:47.683 --> 01:35:52.166]  You were pointing out that this does not make humans sick.
[01:35:52.166 --> 01:35:55.749]  I know there's a lot of strains of Ebola.
[01:35:55.749 --> 01:35:59.192]  You have been critical of the response.
[01:35:59.192 --> 01:36:02.675]  Why has the response been lackluster?
[01:36:04.955 --> 01:36:07.696]  I think our guard went down.
[01:36:07.696 --> 01:36:23.503]  The people that handled the Arrested Ebola Outbreak from USAMRIP, United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease, this was the Aeromedical Isolation Team, or what became the Aeromedical Isolation Team.
[01:36:23.503 --> 01:36:32.908]  These were highly skilled technicians wearing totally appropriate positive pressure ventilators
[01:36:34.731 --> 01:36:39.713]  And the suits that went in and cleaned this mess up.
[01:36:39.713 --> 01:37:00.383]  And the AIT team was built, trained, and put on standby to fly anywhere in the world to aeromedically transport an Ebola case or other hemorrhagic fever case back to Fort Detrick where there was a biosafety level four treatment facility.
[01:37:01.565 --> 01:37:03.066]  So everything was handled completely.
[01:37:03.066 --> 01:37:14.456]  In fact, the isolator that would come off the helicopter would seal to the outside of the building and the patient would be brought in for biosafety level 4 care.
[01:37:14.456 --> 01:37:22.282]  Physicians from Walter Reed, highly experienced, would come up, put on the spacesuits and, you know, top flight intensive care.
[01:37:22.282 --> 01:37:25.625]  In 2010, for some reason, that was shut down.
[01:37:25.625 --> 01:37:28.647]  That capability was lost.
[01:37:28.647 --> 01:37:30.949]  And there was really nothing to replace it.
[01:37:31.656 --> 01:37:38.018]  So you're saying that's why all the default measures weren't there, is because we don't have them anymore?
[01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:44.540]  So we had them before we spent $120 billion, but now we spent $120 billion, we don't have it.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:53.603]  Yeah, essentially we have four designated biosafety level 3 treatment areas scattered throughout the country.
[01:37:53.603 --> 01:37:57.925]  But we kind of lost capability there.
[01:37:59.017 --> 01:38:01.298]  It wasn't just the fact of the facilities.
[01:38:01.298 --> 01:38:10.379]  You had people that were practiced and rehearsed and confident in their equipment.
[01:38:10.379 --> 01:38:17.281]  It's hard to work in those suits and to try to put a tube into somebody's lungs at an intubation.
[01:38:17.281 --> 01:38:21.302]  When you're wearing a space suit, it's a little bit difficult.
[01:38:21.302 --> 01:38:28.543]  These physicians had practiced, rehearsed, and there was an area of calm about the entire thing because we knew you were fully protected.
[01:38:29.594 --> 01:38:34.590]  When you handle these type of infections under a less than biosafety level 3,
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.762]  Decontamination is very, very, very important.
[01:38:39.762 --> 01:38:40.843]  Well, that's my question.
[01:38:40.843 --> 01:38:51.290]  They had to know that nurses and people were going to get Ebola if they're treating Ebola patients that are in the final stages bleeding everywhere, like the guy, Patient Zero, that died in Dallas.
[01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:52.771]  I mean, they had to know.
[01:38:52.771 --> 01:38:57.315]  And so when Obama comes out and says everything's going to be fine, it doesn't create a lot of confidence.
[01:38:57.315 --> 01:39:02.779]  I've talked to medical doctors on-air and off-air saying that when they see people with Ebola symptoms,
[01:39:03.419 --> 01:39:09.765]  That there are CDC teams showing up in spacesuits, taking them out in the middle of the night and telling them don't talk about it.
[01:39:09.765 --> 01:39:10.786]  We've had them on record.
[01:39:10.786 --> 01:39:11.908]  The media attacked us.
[01:39:11.908 --> 01:39:22.718]  Now Forbes is reporting that they were at a CDC press conference and that they met with reporters, AP and others, and they said we've all agreed to cover up new Ebola cases.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:29.284]  I agree with you, and I'm no scientist, but I don't think it's going to spread everywhere and be a super big deal.
[01:39:29.284 --> 01:39:38.011]  But at the same time, why would they then be leaving the planes open, not stopping the visas like you've written and said they should?
[01:39:38.011 --> 01:39:43.896]  Why then would they be covering it up on one hand while letting it come in on the other?
[01:39:43.896 --> 01:39:48.940]  Well, I have not heard anything about a cover-up, but let's look at it this way.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:51.802]  When Mr. Duncan, the
[01:39:53.314 --> 01:39:56.177]  Patient that died in Texas.
[01:39:56.177 --> 01:40:00.200]  Two nurses were secondarily exposed.
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:12.492]  My understanding for the one nurse that flew from Texas to Cincinnati and back, that 800 people had to be contact traced by epidemiologists.
[01:40:12.492 --> 01:40:15.795]  That's one case.
[01:40:15.795 --> 01:40:18.157]  Putting a quarantine will never be totally effective.
[01:40:20.217 --> 01:40:25.298]  But when you build a defense for this type of thing, you try to have it in layers.
[01:40:25.298 --> 01:40:27.399]  Just like a military camp.
[01:40:27.399 --> 01:40:32.740]  You have claymore mines out on the periphery, and then you have trenches and interlocking arcs of fire.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:39.541]  You have layered defenses trying to reduce the potential number of cases.
[01:40:39.541 --> 01:40:44.042]  Canada's put in, it's my understanding, they put in a national quarantine there.
[01:40:46.312 --> 01:40:51.294]  It's, it's, it's, our elected leaders have chosen not to do that.
[01:40:51.294 --> 01:40:59.817]  My worry is that, not Ebola, but other cases, other, other diseases.
[01:40:59.817 --> 01:41:14.322]  If one patient on an aircraft took 800 contact tracings, how many patients flying on aircraft infected would it take to overload our national and state's capability to perform contact tracing?
[01:41:16.612 --> 01:41:20.213]  It's fairly labor-intensive, finding out who the space...
[01:41:20.996 --> 01:41:22.978]  Sure, at a certain point you get overwhelmed.
[01:41:22.978 --> 01:41:28.783]  So, I mean the default, correct me if I'm wrong, is you stop the visas from the five countries affected.
[01:41:28.783 --> 01:41:30.384]  A bunch of other nations have done that.
[01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:33.647]  From England to Australia have been criticized.
[01:41:33.647 --> 01:41:36.309]  The African countries have done the same thing.
[01:41:36.309 --> 01:41:39.072]  People that come in that show signs, you quarantine them.
[01:41:39.072 --> 01:41:48.380]  And it's not that it's going to 100% stop them, but like you said, it's putting up layers of defenses so it doesn't get in, spread out of control, and then you can't get it under control.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:58.366]  Well, even with quarantine, you must expect cases to get in, but it's at a manageable level for your national and state resources.
[01:41:58.366 --> 01:42:11.634]  Now, we've used fever as one of the criteria and thermal scanners in the airports, but in the published literature, outbreaks in Uganda and this present outbreak
[01:42:12.863 --> 01:42:18.667]  New England Journal of Medicine in October 16, 2014 is probably the most up-to-date.
[01:42:18.667 --> 01:42:24.350]  And they report that in 12% of cases, Ebola can present without fever.
[01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:30.013]  And the absence of fever is not a reliable indication that an individual is not infected.
[01:42:30.013 --> 01:42:32.895]  Sure, because Advil or Tylenol can knock it down, right?
[01:42:36.274 --> 01:42:38.214]  That's what they're saying as well.
[01:42:38.214 --> 01:42:41.975]  I don't know about that in the pharmacological interreactions.
[01:42:41.975 --> 01:42:48.416]  I know some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents can reduce fever.
[01:42:48.416 --> 01:42:50.457]  Tylenol can do that.
[01:42:50.457 --> 01:42:51.517]  Sure, sure.
[01:42:51.517 --> 01:43:00.958]  But to use this as a full mass screening in 12% of the cases may not be showing the fever.
[01:43:00.958 --> 01:43:02.839]  So again, it's part of defense.
[01:43:06.028 --> 01:43:11.772]  And the SARS outbreak, I mean, fever was a presenting sign there.
[01:43:11.772 --> 01:43:18.958]  And Singapore and some other countries were very, very quickly able to get on top of this.
[01:43:18.958 --> 01:43:24.402]  Or it could have been really quite a public health disaster for Singapore.
[01:43:24.402 --> 01:43:32.548]  And when they were home quarantined, somebody over there for the SARS virus, they had people phoning every hour, the house.
[01:43:32.548 --> 01:43:33.429]  And if you weren't there,
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.801]  And you were supposed to be under house quarantine.
[01:43:36.801 --> 01:43:39.863]  The police came by to get you.
[01:43:39.863 --> 01:43:43.584]  So, we know how to handle these things.
[01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:46.266]  We've known for a hundred years.
[01:43:46.266 --> 01:43:47.927]  What do you make of this nurse?
[01:43:47.927 --> 01:43:50.868]  Well, the doctor in New York has a fever.
[01:43:50.868 --> 01:43:57.671]  He's at bowling alleys, the A train, he's at restaurants, and then he lied about it reportedly to the police.
[01:43:57.671 --> 01:44:00.133]  I mean, this guy's a medical doctor out of a hot zone.
[01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:01.373]  He's got a fever.
[01:44:01.373 --> 01:44:02.874]  What is he thinking running around?
[01:44:04.298 --> 01:44:05.819]  I can't comment on that.
[01:44:05.819 --> 01:44:13.383]  I don't know the details of the case, but we do know that skin shedding of the virus can occur.
[01:44:13.383 --> 01:44:29.451]  In advanced cases, you can take a skin swab off someone, and using fairly non-sophisticated techniques, it's got a big, long word, immunohistochemistry, but you can see a bolivirus in the skin.
[01:44:29.451 --> 01:44:31.892]  The virus replicates in certain cells in the skin,
[01:44:32.972 --> 01:44:39.923]  You know your skin has a growing layer and it sheds and you're constantly flaking dead skin cells off.
[01:44:39.923 --> 01:44:48.916]  And these Langerhans cells, the virus replicates inside them, it goes outside the Langerhans cells and it can get pushed to the surface.
[01:44:49.264 --> 01:44:57.593]  Dr. Stephen Hatfield is our guest, one of the top bioweapons experts out there, advising major African governments on this biggest Ebola outbreak ever.
[01:44:57.593 --> 01:45:00.196]  And talking about the response, if you just joined us, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:45:00.196 --> 01:45:06.463]  I want us to go to some phone calls now in the 10-15 minutes we've got left with Stephen Hatfield.
[01:45:06.463 --> 01:45:10.428]  And of course you can visit his website, Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, that he's part of.
[01:45:10.968 --> 01:45:14.890]  DDPonline.org for doctors and others.
[01:45:14.890 --> 01:45:17.992]  They'll be part of the organization to get the latest up-to-date information.
[01:45:17.992 --> 01:45:19.613]  Go there and become a member as well.
[01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:22.854]  Has a lot of important news and information as well.
[01:45:22.854 --> 01:45:23.535]  Looking at this...
[01:45:24.995 --> 01:45:33.400]  What is, you know, the FBI had asked major universities to not release, I guess, the way to weaponize mousepox and things like this.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.941]  You talk about monkeypox and things.
[01:45:35.941 --> 01:45:40.864]  Obviously, there have been weaponized things in government labs around the country.
[01:45:40.864 --> 01:45:46.267]  South Africa came out in some of their hearings, was trying to weaponize things for race-specific reasons.
[01:45:46.267 --> 01:45:49.429]  I know a lot of that stuff's classified, but specifically,
[01:45:50.369 --> 01:45:51.931]  Are you worried about that more?
[01:45:51.931 --> 01:45:55.254]  You know, and the Russians and the Cold War with weaponized anthrax?
[01:45:55.254 --> 01:45:59.938]  Or are you worried more about what's coming out of the jungle merging with something?
[01:45:59.938 --> 01:46:06.224]  I mean, could we see something that makes airborne Ebola look tame?
[01:46:06.224 --> 01:46:09.827]  A 12 monkeys scenario?
[01:46:09.827 --> 01:46:12.650]  Yeah, I just want to finish the answer to my skin shedding.
[01:46:12.650 --> 01:46:13.370]  Yes.
[01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:16.153]  We don't know when during infection this occurs.
[01:46:17.642 --> 01:46:22.446]  The things that were looked at were late, you know, almost terminal cases.
[01:46:22.446 --> 01:46:31.112]  But we don't have data on when skin shedding occurs, and if you're infected through skin, the virus would be replicating there.
[01:46:31.112 --> 01:46:35.376]  So, I mean, what I'm trying to say is there's still some uncertainty there.
[01:46:35.376 --> 01:46:41.340]  So when we develop first responder guidelines, we always need to err on the side
[01:46:42.252 --> 01:46:42.633]  I get it.
[01:46:42.633 --> 01:46:52.701]  So we need to tell the firemen, the police, the medical workers, as you wrote in the Atlantic, that they could get it by brushing up against somebody.
[01:46:52.701 --> 01:47:06.413]  What I can say is this, Medicine's Own Frontier, MSF, probably have the greatest number of people experienced with handling Ebola.
[01:47:06.413 --> 01:47:10.076]  They've been absolutely heroic in their efforts in Africa.
[01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:26.302]  On their own guidelines, their handbook for handling these patients, the degree for a risk for accidental exposures and the unclear or variable section of their degrees of risk.
[01:47:26.302 --> 01:47:36.291]  They mentioned direct contact between intact skin and an example touched by a symptomatic Ebola patient.
[01:47:37.985 --> 01:47:47.288]  And their guidelines were immediate observation at the field or at the national capital level of these instances.
[01:47:47.288 --> 01:48:00.271]  So, we know patients in advanced stages, and this is part of the transmission, handling the bodies, burying the bodies without proper protective gear and this type of thing.
[01:48:00.271 --> 01:48:02.832]  These are late cases, but we don't have data.
[01:48:03.962 --> 01:48:06.606]  To indicate when the viral shedding starts.
[01:48:06.606 --> 01:48:10.152]  So we're assuming it's in late stage cases.
[01:48:10.152 --> 01:48:14.538]  Well, assuming is not erring on the side of caution.
[01:48:14.538 --> 01:48:15.640]  So we need further study.
[01:48:16.414 --> 01:48:19.955]  Sure, well all these Texas officials and federal officials said there's no way to get it.
[01:48:19.955 --> 01:48:22.616]  You have to be vomited on, into an open wound.
[01:48:22.616 --> 01:48:24.757]  That's been shown not to be true.
[01:48:24.757 --> 01:48:28.998]  And clearly it looks like this Ebola is hardier, spreading more than ever before.
[01:48:28.998 --> 01:48:31.799]  So something's going on here.
[01:48:31.799 --> 01:48:37.000]  I want to go to these callers, John, Justin, Mike, Jake and others that are patiently holding.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:43.702]  But Doc, what about Bio... I'm more worried about the jungle.
[01:48:43.702 --> 01:48:45.943]  To answer your question before this.
[01:48:46.744 --> 01:48:47.844]  There are things out there.
[01:48:47.844 --> 01:48:51.805]  There's a virus called the Bas-Congo virus.
[01:48:51.805 --> 01:48:56.506]  Time from death between first showing symptoms is two to three days.
[01:48:56.506 --> 01:48:59.007]  There's only been about three or four cases.
[01:48:59.007 --> 01:48:59.387]  Wow.
[01:48:59.387 --> 01:49:01.227]  We don't know a lot about this.
[01:49:01.227 --> 01:49:11.690]  There's another virus that hasn't jumped species yet, it's still in the monkeys, called simian hemorrhagic fever, and this has 100% lethality in monkeys.
[01:49:13.348 --> 01:49:24.332]  Now, it hasn't jumped to humans yet, and we're trying to watch this, but Mother Nature is really not something you want to mess with.
[01:49:24.332 --> 01:49:33.955]  It requires the highest sort of thinking on this, and always erring on the side of caution when you're dealing with human life.
[01:49:33.955 --> 01:49:35.556]  Now, what was the virus that kills 100%?
[01:49:37.429 --> 01:49:41.130]  Well, it's a monkey virus that hasn't jumped into humans that we know of yet.
[01:49:41.130 --> 01:49:44.211]  It's called semi-emihemorrhagic fever.
[01:49:44.211 --> 01:49:48.553]  And then what was the other one that's only a few people have gotten it, but it kills them in a matter of days?
[01:49:48.553 --> 01:49:53.414]  It's called the BAS, B-A-S, dash Congo virus.
[01:49:53.414 --> 01:49:55.935]  Wow, and imagine if those got out.
[01:49:55.935 --> 01:49:57.316]  Well, we don't know how it's transmitted.
[01:49:57.316 --> 01:50:01.337]  It looks like it's probably, again, the fruit bats.
[01:50:01.337 --> 01:50:03.578]  But, you know, we're not certain yet.
[01:50:03.578 --> 01:50:04.678]  It might be arthropod.
[01:50:05.609 --> 01:50:10.593]  You know, insect transmitted, we don't know and there's still a lot of research going on on this.
[01:50:10.593 --> 01:50:16.677]  But it serves as an example that Mother Nature holds a lot of surprises for us.
[01:50:16.677 --> 01:50:21.901]  And, I mean, right now we live in a virtual sea of viruses.
[01:50:21.901 --> 01:50:27.886]  We can't see them, we can't detect them, we can't smell them, we can't touch them, but they're all around us.
[01:50:27.886 --> 01:50:34.871]  Only a few, only about 1,700 infectious agents have the capacity to affect people.
[01:50:36.121 --> 01:50:41.003]  But anytime they could mutate, and then there'll be a chain reaction and we're not ready at all.
[01:50:41.003 --> 01:50:43.704]  See look, the more money we spend, the less ready we are.
[01:50:43.704 --> 01:50:44.564]  It's bizarre.
[01:50:44.564 --> 01:50:45.765]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:50:45.765 --> 01:50:46.665]  Yeah.
[01:50:46.665 --> 01:50:47.065]  Bizarre.
[01:50:47.065 --> 01:50:50.146]  Dr. Steven Hatfield is here with us today.
[01:50:50.146 --> 01:50:51.547]  Let's take some phone calls.
[01:50:51.547 --> 01:50:53.988]  John in North Carolina, thanks for being patient.
[01:50:53.988 --> 01:50:55.648]  You're on the air.
[01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:58.149]  Hi, yeah, I had a couple of questions for Steven Hatfield.
[01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:59.730]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[01:50:59.730 --> 01:51:04.612]  Yeah, Steven, can you tell us what you were doing in North Carolina back in November of 2001?
[01:51:06.022 --> 01:51:09.043]  No.
[01:51:09.043 --> 01:51:10.623]  That was a classified project.
[01:51:10.623 --> 01:51:11.684]  No, I don't either.
[01:51:11.684 --> 01:51:14.445]  I don't remember being in Clayton, North Carolina.
[01:51:14.445 --> 01:51:14.565]  No.
[01:51:36.321 --> 01:51:39.467]  That's uh, you're thinking of somebody else.
[01:51:47.156 --> 01:51:49.498]  Is this an FBI agent calling in or something?
[01:51:49.498 --> 01:51:51.899]  No, this is a Steven Hetzel's victim.
[01:51:51.899 --> 01:51:52.740]  Okay.
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:54.741]  Listen, here's the deal.
[01:51:54.741 --> 01:51:57.023]  The FBI went after like four or five people.
[01:51:57.023 --> 01:51:58.244]  He's won a lawsuit.
[01:51:58.244 --> 01:52:00.546]  He wasn't involving anthrax attacks, folks.
[01:52:00.546 --> 01:52:01.606]  I studied them.
[01:52:01.606 --> 01:52:08.471]  We have a prime suspect that was never gone after who was checked into the area where it was at.
[01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:10.333]  And we don't screen phone calls.
[01:52:10.333 --> 01:52:11.754]  I'm trying to get in a fight with the caller.
[01:52:11.754 --> 01:52:13.014]  No, no, that's okay.
[01:52:13.014 --> 01:52:15.036]  I was in the rotation army.
[01:52:16.892 --> 01:52:18.354]  I don't know the terrorist's name.
[01:52:18.354 --> 01:52:21.218]  It was in Mozambique.
[01:52:21.218 --> 01:52:27.548]  The man was carrying a weapon, and he was coming across the border to brutalize innocent tribespeople.
[01:52:30.356 --> 01:52:31.397]  You've done a lot of interesting things.
[01:52:31.397 --> 01:52:33.559]  We ought to get you on some time just about your life.
[01:52:33.559 --> 01:52:37.242]  Years ago, I did have you on separately about the whole Anthrax deal.
[01:52:37.242 --> 01:52:38.943]  You probably don't even remember that.
[01:52:38.943 --> 01:52:44.828]  But you don't do a ton of interviews these days, but you are doing more, I guess, to respond to what's happening with Ebola.
[01:52:44.828 --> 01:52:52.715]  I wasn't even going to go there with the Anthrax case, but they later admitted that you just had zero connection and it was quackery.
[01:52:52.715 --> 01:52:56.018]  I don't even want to name names here, but it just literally
[01:52:56.658 --> 01:53:02.101]  Just got, you got fingered because you were one of the people advising the government on anthrax.
[01:53:02.101 --> 01:53:04.442]  And so you were just a name they picked out of a hat.
[01:53:04.442 --> 01:53:07.604]  Well actually I wasn't advising the government on anthrax.
[01:53:07.604 --> 01:53:09.545]  We were training them.
[01:53:09.545 --> 01:53:13.167]  We were helping to teach the domestic preparedness program.
[01:53:13.167 --> 01:53:16.489]  Well that's what I meant, like how to counter things like that.
[01:53:16.489 --> 01:53:20.631]  The hospitals in the 120 largest cities, how to handle some sort of an outbreak.
[01:53:22.106 --> 01:53:25.510]  But, uh, anthrax was just one of the agents.
[01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:36.723]  There was tularemia, plague, the plague organism, a virus called VEE, and some others.
[01:53:36.723 --> 01:53:43.270]  But this was just a national program that the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Amendment
[01:53:44.167 --> 01:53:45.668]  Well, that was a bizarre call.
[01:53:45.668 --> 01:53:50.829]  I mean, I would have kept him on, but when people start, you know, saying, I'm a victim, I don't know how I can prove that.
[01:53:50.829 --> 01:53:54.271]  If that person wants to send me proof or information, I'd like to see it.
[01:53:54.271 --> 01:53:58.332]  Maybe Mr. Hadfield will come back on and debate you, but we got him on today about Ebola.
[01:53:58.332 --> 01:54:02.614]  I would have told him up front he was coming on about anthrax, but people, people sure want to know about that.
[01:54:02.614 --> 01:54:06.555]  Have you ever thought about writing a book about the whole anthrax debacle?
[01:54:06.555 --> 01:54:08.416]  Oh yeah, I wrote one.
[01:54:08.416 --> 01:54:12.217]  I mean, I know you wrote one, but have you thought about writing one about now since it all, you know, came out?
[01:54:14.853 --> 01:54:17.634]  I wrote one during the time.
[01:54:17.634 --> 01:54:18.775]  In fact, I think I read that book.
[01:54:18.775 --> 01:54:19.495]  What was the name of it?
[01:54:19.495 --> 01:54:21.556]  No, I haven't published it.
[01:54:21.556 --> 01:54:23.297]  It must have been a book about the anthrax attacks.
[01:54:23.297 --> 01:54:26.718]  You know, 14 years goes by and you forget a lot of stuff.
[01:54:26.718 --> 01:54:29.620]  Look, I'm used to this, so this isn't a problem.
[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:32.641]  This happens all the time still.
[01:54:32.641 --> 01:54:38.343]  Once you're named a person of interest, that never goes away.
[01:54:38.343 --> 01:54:39.264]  It continues.
[01:54:41.004 --> 01:54:51.509]  Well look, if something happens in Austin now, a city of two million people, folks online say I must be involved.
[01:54:51.509 --> 01:54:54.150]  I mean it just goes on and on.
[01:54:54.150 --> 01:54:55.831]  Let's talk to Justin in Texas.
[01:54:55.831 --> 01:54:56.752]  Justin, you're on the air.
[01:54:56.752 --> 01:55:00.253]  Hey Alex.
[01:55:00.253 --> 01:55:02.234]  Welcome.
[01:55:02.234 --> 01:55:02.555]  Thank you.
[01:55:02.555 --> 01:55:04.235]  Thanks for having me.
[01:55:04.235 --> 01:55:06.817]  Shout out and props to all the guys on your staff.
[01:55:06.817 --> 01:55:08.517]  Everybody's doing an excellent job.
[01:55:08.517 --> 01:55:08.958]  Thank you brother.
[01:55:10.146 --> 01:55:12.148]  And we miss you here in Corpus Christi.
[01:55:12.148 --> 01:55:13.229]  It's been a while.
[01:55:13.229 --> 01:55:18.073]  So I'd just like to touch base on something.
[01:55:18.073 --> 01:55:29.563]  I'm in my 30s and I can tell that there's a lot of people in the same age bracket that have concerns and like what they're able to do and what they can't do and what they can get away with and the legalities of this.
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:42.525]  Right now, I read an article recently about Operation American Freedom that might be a spinoff of the Operation American Spring, if you remember that.
[01:55:42.525 --> 01:55:44.505]  Sure, that's specifically on how to get politically active.
[01:55:44.505 --> 01:55:46.966]  Do you have a question for our guest?
[01:55:46.966 --> 01:55:51.508]  Well, not so much for the guest, but I'm just curious what we can do.
[01:55:51.508 --> 01:55:55.930]  There's a lot... Well, I'm going to put you on hold and come back to you, because we're talking about Ebola right now.
[01:55:55.930 --> 01:55:58.131]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Wyoming.
[01:55:58.131 --> 01:55:58.811]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:56:01.033 --> 01:56:13.720]  So, Mr. Hatfield, you would have us believe that it's just serendipity that these Ebola outbreaks are occurring in areas that are rich in oil, gas, gold, diamonds, that the virus is just jumping species.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:28.648]  And how are we to reconcile your comments with those of Dr. Francis Boyle about a week ago, where he said that my alma mater, UTMB Galveston, Tulane, CDC, are all working at weaponizing Ebola.
[01:56:30.228 --> 01:56:35.451]  Well, the Soviets tried for years to weaponize Ebola and they couldn't stabilize it.
[01:56:35.451 --> 01:56:42.555]  What they did do was they managed to weaponize one of its relatives called the Marburg virus, which they make quite a bit of.
[01:56:42.555 --> 01:56:50.679]  In response to, why are these outbreaks occurring in environmentally rich and mineral rich areas?
[01:56:50.679 --> 01:56:55.722]  These areas happen to be in areas that we call high biodiversity.
[01:56:55.722 --> 01:56:58.884]  And there's about 12 biomes scattered throughout the world.
[01:57:00.177 --> 01:57:14.129]  And if you look at the number of conflicts, wars that have occurred, about 80% of these since 1953 have occurred in these stressed high biodiversity areas.
[01:57:14.129 --> 01:57:17.712]  And when you stress these biodiversity areas, i.e.
[01:57:17.712 --> 01:57:29.101]  fragment the jungle, have human enroachment to the edge of the jungle, destroy natural food sources, this type of thing for the animals, this is where you start to see these
[01:57:31.182 --> 01:57:37.425]  Sure, one argument is that South Africa was trying to develop weaponized airborne Ebola and other things.
[01:57:37.425 --> 01:57:39.746]  We've played some of those clips here from the news.
[01:57:39.746 --> 01:57:47.009]  And I think what Mike's getting into here is we've had a lot of experts on pointing out that the U.S.
[01:57:47.009 --> 01:57:51.031]  is using this outbreak as a cover to send in AFRICOM to take over the resources.
[01:57:51.031 --> 01:57:52.832]  The Chinese are sending thousands of people.
[01:57:52.832 --> 01:57:57.454]  No, I don't put anything above the Chinese.
[01:57:58.879 --> 01:58:08.726]  The United States, and it's a humanitarian thing, the soldiers that are going over are from a transport battalion.
[01:58:08.726 --> 01:58:11.428]  They're going over very bravely.
[01:58:11.428 --> 01:58:21.214]  I don't know what level of training they receive or self-protection against the virus, but they're going over there very bravely because the country asked them to.
[01:58:22.770 --> 01:58:23.390]  Well, it is true.
[01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:29.412]  I think they've got five hours training, so they're certainly not combat groups.
[01:58:29.412 --> 01:58:30.472]  But folks are looking at that.
[01:58:30.472 --> 01:58:31.432]  I know you've got to go.
[01:58:31.432 --> 01:58:38.374]  If you can do five more minutes with us, I want to come back and talk about the organization that you're part of, DDPonline.org.
[01:58:38.374 --> 01:58:39.514]  That's a great question, caller.
[01:58:39.514 --> 01:58:46.896]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.419 --> 01:58:56.522]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:58:56.522 --> 01:58:59.844]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:58:59.844 --> 01:59:01.625]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:59:01.625 --> 01:59:07.988]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:59:07.988 --> 01:59:13.891]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:59:14.031 --> 01:59:17.993]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:59:17.993 --> 01:59:21.055]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:59:21.055 --> 01:59:29.340]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:31.441]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:59:31.441 --> 01:59:32.502]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:59:32.862 --> 01:59:41.790]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:44.452]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[01:59:44.452 --> 01:59:52.800]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:55.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:06.263 --> 02:00:07.585]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.585 --> 02:00:09.347]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.347 --> 02:00:11.109]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:12.691]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.691 --> 02:00:14.233]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.233 --> 02:00:18.438]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.438 --> 02:00:22.484]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.824 --> 02:00:25.286]  We're going to take a few more calls real quick for our guest.
[02:00:25.286 --> 02:00:30.068]  He's got to go, but we'll have him back sometime to talk about his life and all the interesting things he's done.
[02:00:30.068 --> 02:00:32.010]  Dr. Steven Hatfield.
[02:00:32.010 --> 02:00:33.230]  I read a book about him years ago.
[02:00:33.230 --> 02:00:33.931]  Very interesting guy.
[02:00:33.931 --> 02:00:38.514]  I forget the book's title, but it was... So that's why I was thinking I'd read his book, which he hasn't published yet.
[02:00:38.514 --> 02:00:40.035]  He should put it out.
[02:00:40.035 --> 02:00:40.935]  Very interesting fellow.
[02:00:40.935 --> 02:00:42.256]  DDPonline.org.
[02:00:42.256 --> 02:00:43.477]  He's on the board of it.
[02:00:43.477 --> 02:00:45.518]  Doctors for Disaster Preparedness.
[02:00:45.518 --> 02:00:47.459]  Tell us about DDPonline.org.
[02:00:47.459 --> 02:00:50.801]  I ran into this organization through a friend.
[02:00:53.238 --> 02:00:58.042]  And I really don't join anything, but I had a look at them.
[02:00:58.042 --> 02:01:08.169]  They're controversial, but there were some very well-known scientists on their list.
[02:01:08.169 --> 02:01:20.978]  And DDP has sort of, for the last several years, really been looking at the data on man-made-caused global warming.
[02:01:23.297 --> 02:01:37.910]  And some really distinguished people, Fred Singer, Dr. Fred Singer, Dr. Willie Soon, you know, some very, very established scientists.
[02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:43.815]  And slowly, I went, I forget what I talked on the first time.
[02:01:43.815 --> 02:01:46.377]  I was asked to give a presentation.
[02:01:46.377 --> 02:01:49.840]  And I went to another meeting.
[02:01:50.476 --> 02:02:00.944]  And I started looking at the evidence where man-made caused global warming myself, and it was quite an eye-opener.
[02:02:00.944 --> 02:02:13.835]  If you look at the actual scientific data, and how the politics have become involved, and how people just accepted that, well, yes, man-made CO2 production was
[02:02:15.370 --> 02:02:23.675]  Anyway, I don't want to get into the climate debate, but... But, I mean, bottom line, is man-made global warming happening?
[02:02:23.675 --> 02:02:29.839]  Well, the guy that started the Weather Channel, a very distinguished meteorologist, says it's not due to man.
[02:02:29.839 --> 02:02:34.102]  Of course, it's the sun, and if we didn't have carbon dioxide, we'd all be dead.
[02:02:34.102 --> 02:02:38.745]  We're having some great variabilities and unexpected things in our solar cycle.
[02:02:39.614 --> 02:02:43.037]  Yeah, it's the sun.
[02:02:43.037 --> 02:02:44.078]  It's the sun.
[02:02:44.078 --> 02:02:46.240]  No matter what the UN says.
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:48.301]  I'm not a top virologist, but I know it's the sun.
[02:02:48.301 --> 02:03:00.572]  I'm not either, and I don't want to get into that, but I enjoyed the fact that scientists were challenging government statements based on the science.
[02:03:00.572 --> 02:03:01.773]  And I thought, wow, this is
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:04.701]  So it's a great organization.
[02:03:04.701 --> 02:03:07.603]  Scientists and others should get involved with it.
[02:03:07.603 --> 02:03:09.163]  Let's take one final call quickly.
[02:03:09.163 --> 02:03:10.004]  Denise in Texas.
[02:03:10.004 --> 02:03:11.405]  I'll get to others after he goes.
[02:03:11.405 --> 02:03:14.366]  Denise, real quick question for Dr. Hatfield.
[02:03:14.366 --> 02:03:15.027]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:15.027 --> 02:03:17.268]  What can I do to help?
[02:03:17.268 --> 02:03:21.571]  If I call the Senator, what can I tell the Senator to help?
[02:03:21.571 --> 02:03:23.532]  Well, go ahead like Lowell.
[02:03:23.532 --> 02:03:26.574]  I mean, you know, doctors and people say we should have more of a quarantine.
[02:03:26.574 --> 02:03:27.734]  Right, Doc?
[02:03:27.734 --> 02:03:30.976]  Well, that's my opinion.
[02:03:30.976 --> 02:03:32.517]  There's going to be a Senate hearing.
[02:03:33.797 --> 02:03:42.880]  I think on the November 11th, where they're pulling in, and don't lay everything at the feet of the poor CDC director.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:46.621]  He inherited a lot of this.
[02:03:46.621 --> 02:03:56.424]  There's going to be some people that are head of bureaucracies being called up to the Hill to answer questions from your elected representatives.
[02:03:56.424 --> 02:03:59.285]  So if you had a particular question or something you wanted
[02:04:00.054 --> 02:04:01.156]  By all means.
[02:04:01.156 --> 02:04:11.817]  How it works in this country is you contact your elected representative and tell them you have a question they would like to be asked during that hearing and cross your fingers.
[02:04:13.246 --> 02:04:14.166]  Well, Doc, I know this.
[02:04:14.166 --> 02:04:17.627]  There's clearly an attempt to shut down Ebola news and to cover it up.
[02:04:17.627 --> 02:04:19.648]  That's why we're watching it so closely.
[02:04:19.648 --> 02:04:21.529]  Thank you so much for the time.
[02:04:21.529 --> 02:04:25.830]  And that's Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, ddponline.org.
[02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:27.290]  Dr. Stephen Hetfield, thank you so much.
[02:04:27.290 --> 02:04:32.692]  I hope you'll come back on sometime to talk about that book you haven't published and what you've done in your life.
[02:04:32.692 --> 02:04:33.952]  It's pretty interesting.
[02:04:33.952 --> 02:04:38.134]  If I manage to stay alive in Africa, I will.
[02:04:38.134 --> 02:04:39.494]  Oh, so you're about to go to Africa?
[02:04:39.494 --> 02:04:40.194]  Yeah.
[02:04:40.194 --> 02:04:40.514]  Oh, wow.
[02:04:40.514 --> 02:04:42.035]  Well, let us talk to you when you come back.
[02:04:44.127 --> 02:04:45.089]  All right, thank you very much.
[02:04:45.089 --> 02:04:45.750]  Okay, sir.
[02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.990]  Bye.
[02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.491]  There he goes.
[02:04:46.491 --> 02:04:46.771]  All right.
[02:04:46.771 --> 02:04:48.454]  We're going to come back, get to other calls.
[02:04:48.454 --> 02:04:50.497]  You had questions, but you can speak to Ebola.
[02:04:50.497 --> 02:04:52.741]  Then we'll open it back up on election news.
[02:04:52.741 --> 02:04:57.729]  And we're just giving you different perspectives on Ebola from different well-known experts, okay?
[02:04:57.729 --> 02:04:58.270]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.570]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.333 --> 02:05:10.901]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:05:10.901 --> 02:05:17.346]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:17.346 --> 02:05:19.707]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:19.707 --> 02:05:22.790]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:29.675]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:05:30.197 --> 02:05:33.859]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:33.859 --> 02:05:38.140]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:39.901]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:39.901 --> 02:05:47.764]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:47.764 --> 02:05:48.905]  But for how long?
[02:05:48.905 --> 02:05:55.548]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:55.548 --> 02:05:58.369]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:06:00.106 --> 02:06:01.366]  Another major health threat.
[02:06:01.366 --> 02:06:06.348]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:06:06.348 --> 02:06:09.009]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:06:09.009 --> 02:06:16.051]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:06:16.051 --> 02:06:19.052]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:06:19.052 --> 02:06:22.073]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:06:22.073 --> 02:06:24.013]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:06:24.013 --> 02:06:26.874]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:06:26.954 --> 02:06:32.676]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:06:32.676 --> 02:06:36.178]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:06:36.178 --> 02:06:39.279]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:06:39.279 --> 02:06:46.582]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:06:46.582 --> 02:06:49.803]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:06:58.768 --> 02:07:01.169]  The experts are clear.
[02:07:01.169 --> 02:07:08.274]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:07:08.274 --> 02:07:14.558]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[02:07:14.558 --> 02:07:18.120]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:22.483]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:07:22.483 --> 02:07:27.807]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:07:27.807 --> 02:07:28.827]  Not our iodine.
[02:07:28.827 --> 02:07:32.630]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:07:32.630 --> 02:07:35.172]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:08:17.282 --> 02:08:23.766]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:23.766 --> 02:08:25.587]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.587 --> 02:08:33.731]  Well, if you just joined us, we talked to a well-known bioweapons expert, Dr. Stephen Hatfield.
[02:08:33.731 --> 02:08:37.713]  And I remember at the time, they tried to blame him for the anthrax, they tried to blame, like, three other people.
[02:08:37.713 --> 02:08:39.354]  They got another Patsy.
[02:08:39.354 --> 02:08:43.637]  He then died in FBI custody and they claimed he committed suicide with Tylenol.
[02:08:44.821 --> 02:08:53.146]  So I don't think Hatfield did it and he was won in court 5.6 million dollars.
[02:08:53.146 --> 02:09:02.452]  I mean I don't want to be accused of something sometime and then 14 years after it's found that I wasn't involved people are you know saying I did it.
[02:09:02.452 --> 02:09:09.537]  Now caller we didn't screen your call you could call in and say that if you wanted to it's just that I don't want to this is what I'm sick of.
[02:09:09.537 --> 02:09:11.218]  I get called a conspiracy theorist.
[02:09:13.069 --> 02:09:17.111]  When I don't believe things that are known lies.
[02:09:17.111 --> 02:09:20.712]  Like we're not bringing any illegals and we catch them busting them in.
[02:09:20.712 --> 02:09:22.433]  They're the ones in a conspiracy.
[02:09:22.433 --> 02:09:23.974]  So it's not a theory.
[02:09:23.974 --> 02:09:25.515]  Or secret government testing.
[02:09:25.515 --> 02:09:27.716]  Not a theory.
[02:09:27.716 --> 02:09:30.737]  They've been caught.
[02:09:30.737 --> 02:09:33.938]  Or our debt increasing doesn't increase our debt.
[02:09:33.938 --> 02:09:35.659]  That's not true.
[02:09:35.659 --> 02:09:39.141]  So they call me a conspiracy theorist because I call Obama a liar.
[02:09:39.141 --> 02:09:41.742]  On the other hand though, you've got people out there
[02:09:43.297 --> 02:10:08.294]  that just make up reality as they go along and just make stuff up and I've been such a victim of it myself that I've got a little more careful over the years even when I think something is going in the direction not to go there unless I can really prove it because I've been on the receiving end of what you call real conspiracy theories that are just ridiculous like I'm Jeff Bridges or I'm
[02:10:10.501 --> 02:10:17.786]  Bill Hicks or I work for Stratford because they're in the same city I'm in of two million people.
[02:10:17.786 --> 02:10:24.310]  And then meanwhile, the Stratford emails get leaked and they hate me and are attacking me, which I already knew was going on, which I've done nothing to them.
[02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:30.154]  But it's just ridiculous that this type of stuff is going on.
[02:10:31.158 --> 02:10:34.181]  And it's frustrating, because then it distracts people from the real stuff.
[02:10:34.181 --> 02:10:36.043]  Now, I'm glad that Mark called in.
[02:10:36.043 --> 02:10:36.924]  I know Mark.
[02:10:36.924 --> 02:10:38.946]  He's been calling in for like 15, 16 years.
[02:10:38.946 --> 02:10:41.848]  He's a medical doctor, so it's a lot of good intel.
[02:10:41.848 --> 02:10:47.134]  In fact, before I hung up on him, I meant to ask Mark, have you heard up there where you're a doctor in a hospital?
[02:10:48.464 --> 02:10:50.985]  Have you heard of people being disappeared?
[02:10:50.985 --> 02:10:57.306]  Because that's, we're being told by medical doctors who will go on record and off record, that that's happening.
[02:10:57.306 --> 02:10:58.926]  That's a big deal.
[02:10:58.926 --> 02:11:00.947]  That's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:11:00.947 --> 02:11:02.687]  People are being disappeared.
[02:11:02.687 --> 02:11:05.828]  Whether or not they have Ebola, we don't know.
[02:11:05.828 --> 02:11:09.589]  And then Forbes comes out with the bombshell.
[02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:14.990]  It's LinkedIn read on Infowars.com, Obama caught ordering press to cover up Ebola.
[02:11:16.067 --> 02:11:21.470]  And we should add Ebola-like cases.
[02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:29.415]  And then the Forbes writer says, yeah, I'm at the meeting and the media is all there with the head of the CDC response saying, yeah, we cover this up when we think somebody has Ebola.
[02:11:32.281 --> 02:11:35.223]  Well, then next it's, oh, we cover it up when they disappear, talk show host.
[02:11:35.223 --> 02:11:37.765]  Or we cover it up, that plane crash of that congressman.
[02:11:37.765 --> 02:11:39.126]  Or we cover it up.
[02:11:39.126 --> 02:11:40.988]  We don't need to live in a society like that.
[02:11:40.988 --> 02:11:42.349]  That's what kills societies.
[02:11:42.349 --> 02:11:48.153]  In fact, one of my favorite philosophers, not just science fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein.
[02:11:48.153 --> 02:11:52.537]  A society that gets rid of all its troublemakers goes downhill.
[02:11:52.537 --> 02:11:55.719]  I rarely find a Robert A. Heinlein book that I don't love.
[02:11:55.719 --> 02:11:57.280]  In fact, maybe that's what influenced me.
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:58.381]  A lot of stuff did.
[02:11:58.381 --> 02:12:00.283]  Not just the history books around the house growing up.
[02:12:01.311 --> 02:12:06.814]  That I started reading, starting out with, you know, Time Life, World War II, World War I, the Wild Wild West books.
[02:12:06.814 --> 02:12:17.120]  My parents would never really buy me a lot of toys, but if I said, I want that Time Life book set of the Wild Wild West, you know, adult books, they're like encyclopedias with pictures, and I would just read that.
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:30.047]  I'd read all the World War II books, like a 20-volume set, somewhere around the office now, and read the whole World War I 10-volume set, and the whole Civil War 10-volume set, and the whole 10-volume occult set.
[02:12:30.487 --> 02:12:38.012]  And the stuff I learned in that, and then I actually went out and read the original rare books on it to understand how the globalists operate.
[02:12:38.012 --> 02:12:42.375]  I read, no exaggeration, hundreds of those by the time I was like 12 years old.
[02:12:42.375 --> 02:12:45.297]  By the time I was about 6, 7 years old.
[02:12:45.297 --> 02:12:51.341]  And I just began to, and then I read Robert A. Heinlein books that would be political novels set in the future.
[02:12:52.841 --> 02:12:58.704]  And then I think back how much of those were really political commentary on what was happening at the time.
[02:12:58.704 --> 02:13:06.188]  And Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers, it's not like the movie, it's different than the movie, with their exoskeleton jumpsuits and the training and everything.
[02:13:06.188 --> 02:13:12.171]  That was adopted as official required reading by West Point in the 70s and still is today.
[02:13:12.171 --> 02:13:16.573]  So it just shows how art can influence life and how life can influence
[02:13:18.784 --> 02:13:21.125]  Art can influence life, and life can influence art.
[02:13:21.125 --> 02:13:21.886]  Certainly interesting.
[02:13:21.886 --> 02:13:25.667]  But a society that gets rid of all its troublemakers goes downhill.
[02:13:25.667 --> 02:13:28.909]  Robert A. Heinlein.
[02:13:28.909 --> 02:13:31.090]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[02:13:31.090 --> 02:13:33.351]  John in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[02:13:33.351 --> 02:13:34.351]  Go ahead.
[02:13:34.351 --> 02:13:35.512]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:13:35.512 --> 02:13:36.552]  Hey, buddy.
[02:13:36.552 --> 02:13:37.233]  How you doing?
[02:13:37.233 --> 02:13:37.553]  Pretty good.
[02:13:38.303 --> 02:13:52.034]  Okay, I wish I could have gotten in on your guest, but I'm going to bounce it off of you and possibly maybe you could keep this in the back of your mind next time you interview him or any other guest of his caliber.
[02:13:52.034 --> 02:14:02.442]  My question is, is it possible for this virus to run parallel because you have some DVM experience in your past?
[02:14:03.852 --> 02:14:09.137]  Is it possible that this virus runs parallel to Carvo virus?
[02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:12.270]  That's an interesting question.
[02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:14.230]  I'm no virologist, but I try to study it all.
[02:14:14.230 --> 02:14:23.594]  They're worried it's going to merge or mutate because it's RNA-based, meaning very unstable, with other viruses, with the flu, with something else.
[02:14:23.594 --> 02:14:31.598]  And that's what governments have been trying to do is not so much mutate this virus because it's unstable, but mutate it with another virus that's more stable.
[02:14:31.598 --> 02:14:33.598]  And again, I'm no virologist, I just read what they say.
[02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:36.480]  And listen, he just told you what the African response teams
[02:14:37.728 --> 02:14:42.551]  With top western scientists in there with them, have written in the handbooks, don't touch people.
[02:14:42.551 --> 02:14:44.212]  They believe they're getting it from the skin.
[02:14:44.212 --> 02:14:46.253]  The virus is in the skin.
[02:14:46.253 --> 02:14:48.154]  And it gets into your skin.
[02:14:48.154 --> 02:14:56.979]  Obviously, you're getting it from insects, you're getting it from skin, you're getting it from bats flying over, defecating in the air.
[02:14:56.979 --> 02:14:57.759]  Obviously, I mean...
[02:14:59.346 --> 02:15:08.429]  His point is there's even worse stuff going around that they're just covering up, like that new virus that hits the lungs.
[02:15:08.429 --> 02:15:09.710]  So thank you, John.
[02:15:09.710 --> 02:15:14.231]  Again, the stuff you're bringing up is above my pay grade, so that is a good question.
[02:15:14.231 --> 02:15:16.192]  John in Illinois, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:15:16.192 --> 02:15:18.333]  Or Andrew, excuse me.
[02:15:21.482 --> 02:15:25.265]  The Florida Times Union got a November 4th article.
[02:15:25.265 --> 02:15:28.507]  Ebola hits healthcare access for other diseases.
[02:15:28.507 --> 02:15:37.253]  Well, they're mentioning malaria and it's tens of thousands of deaths from the malaria, but really they're using that to hide the Ebola deaths.
[02:15:37.253 --> 02:15:38.094]  That's an important article.
[02:15:38.094 --> 02:15:39.395]  Yeah, that's been it.
[02:15:39.395 --> 02:15:42.737]  I've seen that in other mainstream articles that they're covering up the real Ebola death toll.
[02:15:42.737 --> 02:15:43.357]  It's not 5,000.
[02:15:43.357 --> 02:15:45.839]  They think it's way above that.
[02:15:45.839 --> 02:15:46.480]  Do me a favor.
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:48.281]  What's the headline on that article and we'll look it up.
[02:15:48.848 --> 02:16:02.209]  Okay, it is Ebola Hits Healthcare Access for Other Diseases by Jonathan Payne-Layla and Sarah DiLorenzo, Associated Press, November the 4th, 2014, out of the Florida Times Union
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:08.221]  And it says jacksonville.com, there's a web link up on it.
[02:16:08.221 --> 02:16:08.881]  No, that's great.
[02:16:08.881 --> 02:16:10.161]  I mean, we'll look that up.
[02:16:10.161 --> 02:16:13.582]  We found that Ebola hits health care access for other diseases.
[02:16:13.582 --> 02:16:21.344]  And you say in the article, they admit that they're just calling it malaria deaths, but it's really Ebola.
[02:16:21.344 --> 02:16:22.304]  We do not pay attention.
[02:16:22.304 --> 02:16:24.404]  We have thousands of deaths because of Ebola.
[02:16:24.404 --> 02:16:27.505]  But we have tens of thousands of deaths from other diseases.
[02:16:27.505 --> 02:16:31.706]  We know it simply that there are high numbers of deaths from other diseases.
[02:16:31.706 --> 02:16:32.826]  But I think that's a smoke screen.
[02:16:33.567 --> 02:16:38.928]  Yeah, well that article, like you said, doesn't exactly spell that out, but it's clear that's going on.
[02:16:38.928 --> 02:16:48.630]  You can search, you know, all over, London Telegraph, you name it, quoting doctors saying, who've been there, that the death toll's way bigger than it is.
[02:16:48.630 --> 02:16:54.371]  And I should have talked to Hatfield about how he's going to Africa, I guess to treat people.
[02:16:54.371 --> 02:16:57.292]  That's why I said, y'all come on your show, maybe, if I live.
[02:16:59.192 --> 02:17:00.812]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:17:30.812 --> 02:17:32.213]  Yeah, I'm a first-time caller.
[02:17:32.213 --> 02:17:35.775]  I've been awake ever since you went to Bohemian Grove.
[02:17:35.775 --> 02:17:37.356]  That's a while.
[02:17:37.356 --> 02:17:52.828]  Yeah, but I'm just calling because here in central PA, our local news channel 10, WTHA, has done a story about the Pennsylvania Health Department monitoring 105 people for Ebola.
[02:17:52.828 --> 02:17:59.553]  I guess that's on top of the 80 that came back with all the students in September because they were monitoring them as well.
[02:18:02.810 --> 02:18:04.211]  What do you think's going on?
[02:18:04.211 --> 02:18:27.663]  I mean, they're telling us forget about Ebola, but if you look at their... Well, if you've got Americans going back and forth between these two countries at this level, we're undoubtedly going to see more Ebola, and then you have the government basically getting the media to cover it up, and that's confirmed by Forbes.
[02:18:27.663 --> 02:18:30.104]  That's a huge story, but don't hold your breath.
[02:18:30.104 --> 02:18:31.205]  Don't expect it to be covered.
[02:18:32.378 --> 02:18:33.639]  Oh, yeah.
[02:18:33.639 --> 02:18:39.261]  Yeah, I've shared everything and I'm pretty sure they've deleted it off their website and everything, so I got a lot of the students I could.
[02:18:39.261 --> 02:18:40.182]  Well, do me a favor.
[02:18:40.182 --> 02:18:45.704]  Send all those tips to showtipsatinfowars.com or whistleblowersatinfowars.com.
[02:18:45.704 --> 02:18:47.825]  You are our eyes and ears.
[02:18:47.825 --> 02:18:53.828]  We need your help watching and tracking everything, so please send it all to infowars.com.
[02:18:53.828 --> 02:18:55.869]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Missouri.
[02:18:55.869 --> 02:18:56.510]  You're on the air.
[02:18:56.510 --> 02:18:56.870]  Go ahead.
[02:18:57.788 --> 02:18:58.969]  Alex, it's an honor.
[02:18:58.969 --> 02:19:17.303]  With regard to the election results and what we can expect next, I think that as long as we, the American people, and the Congress allow him to, we're going to see an unprecedented number of very unpopular executive orders to be signed by Obama, and I think they're unlawful and unconstitutional.
[02:19:17.303 --> 02:19:26.810]  The reason why I say that, I'm somewhat of a student of constitutional law, and if you look historically at the other executive orders that previous presidents have signed,
[02:19:27.610 --> 02:19:33.415]  That they are supposed to sign, they're supposed to provide a reference to a rule of law.
[02:19:33.415 --> 02:19:34.336]  You know what, stay there.
[02:19:34.336 --> 02:19:37.599]  I want you to explain to people, because I know this too, but you're an eloquent fellow.
[02:19:37.599 --> 02:19:38.840]  I want you to break it down.
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:50.689]  The first few hundred executive orders were Washington requesting money for cutlery and plates and drapes so he could entertain the French or British ambassador as president.
[02:19:50.689 --> 02:19:55.814]  And then he has to refer to allotments from Congress of money for the executive.
[02:19:56.494 --> 02:19:59.761]  Now Obama just says, no I'm a king, I have executive orders.
[02:20:00.521 --> 02:20:05.442]  I'm watching and waiting for the right time to take everything you own.
[02:20:05.442 --> 02:20:07.003]  I love a dark house.
[02:20:07.003 --> 02:20:09.103]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:20:09.103 --> 02:20:17.766]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV and makes your home unappealing to would-be thieves.
[02:20:17.766 --> 02:20:19.186]  Don't these people ever leave?

[02:20:22.227 --> 02:20:26.828]  Go to Faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store.
[02:20:26.828 --> 02:20:29.369]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[02:20:30.729 --> 02:20:31.730]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:20:31.730 --> 02:20:35.171]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:20:35.171 --> 02:20:36.851]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[02:20:36.851 --> 02:20:38.792]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:20:38.792 --> 02:20:44.634]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:20:44.634 --> 02:20:45.454]  I know, right?
[02:20:45.454 --> 02:20:46.775]  You love it, too!
[02:20:46.775 --> 02:20:48.215]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:20:48.215 --> 02:20:49.236]  Let's go get some.

[02:21:10.601 --> 02:21:17.883]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:21:17.883 --> 02:21:26.905]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:21:27.145 --> 02:21:32.690]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[02:23:29.685 --> 02:23:31.485]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:23:31.485 --> 02:23:33.146]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:23:33.146 --> 02:23:35.966]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:23:35.966 --> 02:23:38.247]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:23:38.247 --> 02:23:42.767]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:23:42.767 --> 02:23:46.708]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[02:23:50.909 --> 02:23:52.529]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:24:00.595 --> 02:24:06.837]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:24:06.837 --> 02:24:11.658]  Story just went live on Infowars.com, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:24:11.658 --> 02:24:15.759]  Call for your number to join us on air, 800-259-9231.
[02:24:15.759 --> 02:24:20.660]  I'd love to hear from you on the political realignment that just took place.
[02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:23.801]  Do you think it's going to cause any change, or is it just more of the same?
[02:24:25.168 --> 02:24:27.189]  Well that's the cliched question.
[02:24:27.189 --> 02:24:38.333]  It will change things if we stay on the Republicans, if we stop them from destroying the Tea Party, if we take the states back, if we promote liberty and freedom everywhere, we will win.
[02:24:38.333 --> 02:24:43.434]  I'm not that skilled, I'm not that eloquent, but I do love liberty and I won't stop.
[02:24:43.434 --> 02:24:46.315]  And I've been involved politically for 23 years, 20 years on air.
[02:24:49.198 --> 02:24:52.539]  And I've reached hundreds of millions of people globally.
[02:24:52.539 --> 02:24:54.580]  I'm not bragging about that.
[02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:58.381]  It's the good news.
[02:24:58.381 --> 02:25:13.307]  Now when I'm at the mall or downtown or even in another city or in an airport, half the people I walk by, I'm gonna go get a hidden camera and do this in an airport or something, come over and shake my hand or listeners or give me thumbs up, it's like fight club or something.
[02:25:13.307 --> 02:25:15.848]  The number of people that identify with Alex Jones
[02:25:18.188 --> 02:25:26.532]  And most of them have probably only seen the show 10 times, or heard it a few times, or seen me on national television and agree with me.
[02:25:26.532 --> 02:25:32.054]  The point is they resonate with Alex Jones, the wild radical.
[02:25:32.054 --> 02:25:34.475]  Because I'm not radical.
[02:25:34.475 --> 02:25:40.278]  If it's radical to want private property, a right to defend myself, and national sovereignty, and to have transparency in government,
[02:25:41.482 --> 02:25:46.345]  And to want to prosecute these big corporations that are tax-exempt running our government into the ground.
[02:25:46.345 --> 02:25:50.547]  If that's weird, then I'm a weirdo.
[02:25:50.547 --> 02:25:53.129]  So I just want to make that positive announcement again.
[02:25:53.129 --> 02:26:03.635]  A lot of you out there aren't in the media, you aren't well-known, you're not recognized, so you have no idea how many people there are that are awake.
[02:26:03.635 --> 02:26:08.998]  Now there are pockets of the country, in every state, because I've been around the nation, where almost no one's awake.
[02:26:11.837 --> 02:26:13.778]  But then there's pockets where almost everyone's awake.
[02:26:13.778 --> 02:26:17.480]  It's really a weird dichotomy.
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:20.742]  A weird paradox.
[02:26:20.742 --> 02:26:29.606]  But it doesn't matter if half the public doesn't know how to tie their shoelaces and wants to suck their thumb and believes whatever big government tells them.
[02:26:29.606 --> 02:26:32.367]  If 5% of us don't go along with it, it will stop.
[02:26:32.367 --> 02:26:35.389]  So it's time to stop complying with unconstitutional garbage.
[02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:37.130]  It's time to stand up for ourselves.
[02:26:37.130 --> 02:26:39.111]  But it's time to also try to take the system over.
[02:26:40.404 --> 02:26:43.166]  While building alternative grassroots systems.
[02:26:43.166 --> 02:26:45.648]  I say attack on every front.
[02:26:45.648 --> 02:26:48.810]  That doesn't mean that you have to do everything yourself.
[02:26:48.810 --> 02:26:53.193]  The journey of a thousand miles as the Chinese say starts with a single step.
[02:26:53.193 --> 02:26:55.315]  Do little things in your life.
[02:26:55.315 --> 02:26:56.295]  Try to eat organic.
[02:26:57.236 --> 02:26:59.096]  Or non-processed when you can.
[02:26:59.096 --> 02:27:02.337]  Try to support good cops when they do the right thing.
[02:27:02.337 --> 02:27:06.198]  And then stand up against bad cops or bad government when they do the wrong thing.
[02:27:06.198 --> 02:27:12.799]  Like I told my reporters years ago, I said, you know, it's always viral to put a story out when a cop does something really bad.
[02:27:12.799 --> 02:27:24.562]  And I said, we still want to do those reports because it's what's happening, but we want to then try to put a good thing a police officer did next to it or in it, or headline something good
[02:27:26.038 --> 02:27:28.380]  To magnify good behavior.
[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:31.842]  And it's the same thing for us in our own lives.
[02:27:31.842 --> 02:27:36.865]  What's the best way to lead a company or to lead your family is by example.
[02:27:36.865 --> 02:27:40.548]  It's an inside job, just like it always is.
[02:27:40.548 --> 02:27:41.268]  Who sings that song?
[02:27:41.268 --> 02:27:42.909]  We got it as bumper music.
[02:27:42.909 --> 02:27:45.871]  He's the same guy that has the songs, kick them while they're up, kick them while they're down.
[02:27:45.871 --> 02:27:47.072]  His name will pop in my head in a minute.
[02:27:48.598 --> 02:27:49.678]  And I'm not up here preaching.
[02:27:49.678 --> 02:27:51.259]  I'm not up here on a high horse.
[02:27:51.259 --> 02:27:53.559]  I'm not up here saying I have all the answers.
[02:27:53.559 --> 02:28:03.202]  I just know the decadent, who cares, only be out for yourself, that attitude brings down civilizations.
[02:28:03.202 --> 02:28:05.103]  It brings down societies.
[02:28:05.103 --> 02:28:11.805]  For a while, if you're living in a free, open society and you're being a cheat, a liar, a thief, a scammer, yeah, you'll do okay for a while.
[02:28:11.805 --> 02:28:12.185]  But then,
[02:28:14.622 --> 02:28:15.963]  All that comes back on you.
[02:28:15.963 --> 02:28:23.749]  But as a society, when it keeps going on for a long time, it comes back on the culture itself and civilizations die.
[02:28:23.749 --> 02:28:33.115]  And let me tell you, if this civilization starts to collapse, which every expert, every scientist, every mathematician, every economist, in fact, I didn't cover it yesterday and I meant to.
[02:28:33.115 --> 02:28:40.721]  Will you reprint me that Bloomberg article about the top fund manager and economist analyst saying the economy is totally fake and will implode?
[02:28:42.076 --> 02:28:45.699]  There's more articles on that today, and I'm not being negative.
[02:28:45.699 --> 02:28:47.920]  It's like you're in an airplane and you're running out of gas.
[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:51.523]  We better find a place to land or we're going to crash.
[02:28:51.523 --> 02:28:57.808]  We're almost out of gas, and the globalists want to use this crisis that's coming to bring in total control.
[02:28:57.808 --> 02:29:05.874]  We've got to run around like chickens with our heads cut off to try to get good people in place and to get good ideas out front so that as things get even worse,
[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:13.046]  We're in a position to lead, not that we have all the answers, but we certainly have goodwill.
[02:29:13.046 --> 02:29:14.748]  We certainly have a good heart.
[02:29:14.748 --> 02:29:16.450]  We certainly want to fix things.
[02:29:16.450 --> 02:29:19.012]  We certainly don't want to cheat people.
[02:29:19.012 --> 02:29:26.080]  And we know private property, family, Second Amendment works.
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:29.143]  We know being moral, it builds a good society, loving God.
[02:29:31.134 --> 02:29:32.335]  And so we are a free society.
[02:29:32.335 --> 02:29:35.276]  You're free to do what you want, as long as it doesn't hurt somebody else.
[02:29:35.276 --> 02:29:43.999]  Well, what the globalists are doing, signing us on to their trillions in debt, selling out our sovereignty, trying to dumb down our kids so they can manage them, that is hurting us.
[02:29:43.999 --> 02:29:47.200]  And so we have a right to take the country and the world back from them.
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.621]  Your calls and news straight ahead.
[02:29:49.621 --> 02:29:51.022]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.022 --> 02:29:53.543]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.543 --> 02:29:56.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.516 --> 02:30:03.138]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:03.138 --> 02:30:04.619]  Check it out today.
[02:30:04.619 --> 02:30:10.382]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none.
[02:30:10.382 --> 02:30:13.004]  And that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:13.004 --> 02:30:20.128]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:30:20.168 --> 02:30:20.788]  We're good to go.
[02:30:40.916 --> 02:30:41.456]  We're good.
[02:31:00.854 --> 02:31:07.497]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:31:07.497 --> 02:31:12.659]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:31:12.659 --> 02:31:21.363]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:31:21.363 --> 02:31:24.924]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:31:24.924 --> 02:31:27.565]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:31:29.733 --> 02:31:34.464]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:31:34.464 --> 02:31:37.090]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:31:39.532 --> 02:31:41.674]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:31:41.674 --> 02:31:43.456]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:02.051]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:32:02.051 --> 02:32:06.592]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:32:06.592 --> 02:32:11.033]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:32:11.033 --> 02:32:18.355]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:32:18.355 --> 02:32:27.437]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:27.637 --> 02:32:33.199]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[02:33:15.678 --> 02:33:19.220]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:26.325]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:26.325 --> 02:33:30.507]  I want to run through the callers that are on hold right now.
[02:33:30.507 --> 02:33:34.810]  Then I'm going to get into what I mentioned earlier, I meant to cover yesterday.
[02:33:34.810 --> 02:33:36.090]  Fund manager.
[02:33:36.090 --> 02:33:37.391]  Economy is totally fake.
[02:33:37.391 --> 02:33:38.852]  Deep crash coming.
[02:33:38.852 --> 02:33:40.113]  Singer Elliot says U.S.
[02:33:40.113 --> 02:33:40.833]  growth.
[02:33:40.833 --> 02:33:41.394]  Optimism.
[02:33:42.535 --> 02:33:45.997]  Unwarranted, as data is cooked.
[02:33:45.997 --> 02:33:51.159]  I also saw a story in the Daily Mail that I agree with, that I want to break down.
[02:33:51.159 --> 02:34:01.384]  The science of hipsters, mathematical formula, shows that trying to look different ultimately makes everyone look the same.
[02:34:05.290 --> 02:34:14.062]  So we're going to be looking at that because that's how they basically control people, is by creating new fads that everyone buys into.
[02:34:14.062 --> 02:34:16.606]  Thinking they're being different, but really they're not.
[02:34:16.606 --> 02:34:21.632]  And they sell so many of these paradigms as, oh, you're being different, you're being cutting edge.
[02:34:23.021 --> 02:34:26.983]  And then you're not really cutting edge, it's being promoted by the establishment.
[02:34:26.983 --> 02:34:31.826]  Let me tell you what's really hip and what's always in style, Renaissance.
[02:34:31.826 --> 02:34:39.871]  Freedom, true diversity, an open college of ideas, free association, free market.
[02:34:39.871 --> 02:34:42.653]  Why do I talk about free market all day and why it's so good?
[02:34:42.653 --> 02:34:49.897]  It means, if a company wants to sell bonds that are worthless, they can.
[02:34:49.897 --> 02:34:52.139]  But then you're never going to
[02:34:53.430 --> 02:34:58.575]  Be able to sell bonds even short term because everyone will find out you're a fraud.
[02:34:58.575 --> 02:35:01.657]  You don't even go prosecute those people.
[02:35:01.657 --> 02:35:03.879]  You let people civilly sue them and stuff like that.
[02:35:03.879 --> 02:35:19.313]  They'll be run out of town on a rail and then it'll go so badly that no one will ever invest in the fly-by-night operations because folks will be beating down the doors to invest with the companies that never default, that never cheat, that never steal, and that deliver results.
[02:35:21.411 --> 02:35:24.133]  Why do you buy a certain brand of food?
[02:35:24.133 --> 02:35:25.614]  Why do you go to a certain restaurant?
[02:35:25.614 --> 02:35:30.977]  Because it's good consistently and they treat you nice and make you feel like family.
[02:35:30.977 --> 02:35:32.978]  Maybe you eat there 20 times in a year.
[02:35:32.978 --> 02:35:35.500]  One time it's not good.
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:36.460]  You let it slide.
[02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:37.561]  Second time you're not sure.
[02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:38.682]  Third time you don't go back there.
[02:35:39.801 --> 02:35:42.243]  That's what creates excellence in restaurants.
[02:35:42.243 --> 02:35:47.847]  Why do you go to areas in New York and they have the best Chinese food, the best Italian food, the best steakhouses?
[02:35:47.847 --> 02:35:49.709]  Because it's the biggest city in the U.S.
[02:35:49.709 --> 02:35:53.251]  and they've got incredible competition.
[02:35:53.251 --> 02:36:07.863]  Now, you pull into some little town that's only got two restaurants, you already know it's gonna be a bunch of filler, it's gonna taste like crud, nine times out of ten, just like at tourist traps, they'll have restaurants that look okay on the surface but have the worst, cheapest food.
[02:36:09.611 --> 02:36:12.132]  Fish sticks that don't even have fish in them.
[02:36:12.132 --> 02:36:16.555]  Cheese sticks that don't have any cheese in them.
[02:36:16.555 --> 02:36:25.739]  Worst food I ever ate was in Corpus Christi, Texas at a tourist trap right next to the Grey Ghost, the Lexington aircraft carrier.
[02:36:25.739 --> 02:36:28.721]  I went and saw that with my kids.
[02:36:28.721 --> 02:36:32.983]  There's a place there that was like a joke when they brought the food out.
[02:36:34.667 --> 02:36:36.449]  And you can tell, no money went into the food.
[02:36:36.449 --> 02:36:38.330]  It was there to just prey on people.
[02:36:38.330 --> 02:36:40.012]  And that's because it's like government.
[02:36:40.012 --> 02:36:43.895]  You don't have a choice there at the tourist trap if your kids are hungry.
[02:36:43.895 --> 02:36:46.697]  And even though you know tourist traps have horrible food, you still go in.
[02:36:46.697 --> 02:36:47.558]  You still do it.
[02:36:47.558 --> 02:36:49.119]  You still get ranked over the coals.
[02:36:49.119 --> 02:36:50.661]  It's just like government.
[02:36:50.661 --> 02:36:52.262]  You don't hold government accountable.
[02:36:52.262 --> 02:36:55.765]  It becomes just like that where it can do whatever it wants.
[02:36:55.765 --> 02:36:57.086]  Same thing with corporations.
[02:36:57.086 --> 02:36:58.828]  Same thing with the private Federal Reserve.
[02:36:58.828 --> 02:37:01.430]  They can do whatever they want for 100 plus years.
[02:37:03.968 --> 02:37:07.991]  You realize in December, it'll be 101 years.
[02:37:07.991 --> 02:37:20.781]  The 100th anniversary, last December 23rd, when three senators in the dead of night, when everybody was out for the holiday, for Christmas, voted in the Federal Reserve.
[02:37:20.781 --> 02:37:21.802]  The Federal!
[02:37:21.802 --> 02:37:32.470]  It's private, a private board owned by six private global banks, the same families since 1913, who can issue unlimited currency and credit to themselves.
[02:37:34.011 --> 02:37:38.035]  Forbes says a hundred years later, the Federal Reserve has failed everything it tried.
[02:37:38.035 --> 02:37:40.398]  Well, it claims it wants to help us.
[02:37:40.398 --> 02:37:43.521]  But no, it's succeeded in taking over the world, leveraging U.S.
[02:37:43.521 --> 02:37:46.204]  capital through fraud.
[02:37:46.204 --> 02:37:49.908]  But see, what if I had a company that was called Federal?
[02:37:50.700 --> 02:37:53.162]  And then it turned out it wasn't federal.
[02:37:53.162 --> 02:37:59.146]  Sure, we know Federal Express or Federal Ammunition's not really federal, because back then, federal was trusted in 1913.
[02:37:59.146 --> 02:38:04.590]  See, so they wanted to use that name, like Federal Credit Union, federal this, federal that.
[02:38:04.590 --> 02:38:07.393]  But the Federal Reserve folks didn't federal!
[02:38:07.393 --> 02:38:10.315]  But they get on TV and say, we're a branch of the government above the law.
[02:38:10.315 --> 02:38:14.418]  Remember that clip on the Laird NewsHour?
[02:38:16.374 --> 02:38:17.155]  What, five years ago?
[02:38:17.155 --> 02:38:19.837]  You can pull it up on YouTube.
[02:38:19.837 --> 02:38:23.760]  Alan Greenspan says Fed above the law.
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:27.904]  Maybe we can pull that clip up and he says, oh, what can Congress do?
[02:38:27.904 --> 02:38:28.925]  And he goes, nothing.
[02:38:28.925 --> 02:38:30.566]  Congress has no authority over us.
[02:38:30.566 --> 02:38:31.868]  We operate outside of them.
[02:38:31.868 --> 02:38:34.470]  And they're doing a good job as long as they don't know anything.
[02:38:37.233 --> 02:38:38.754]  Congress issues the currency.
[02:38:38.754 --> 02:38:40.776]  Congress is in control of the purse.
[02:38:40.776 --> 02:38:42.638]  But that's how backwards all this has gotten.
[02:38:42.638 --> 02:38:48.503]  So now we have the headline on Infowars.com, Obama's dictatorship is democracy.
[02:38:48.503 --> 02:38:51.746]  But America was founded as a republic.
[02:38:51.746 --> 02:38:57.891]  He says, I was elected, so he doesn't care if I ignore the separation of powers, legislative and the judicial.
[02:38:57.891 --> 02:38:58.812]  I am the executive.
[02:38:58.812 --> 02:39:00.193]  I am unitary.
[02:39:00.193 --> 02:39:02.035]  Hitler was elected too and said the same thing.
[02:39:03.629 --> 02:39:06.030]  They use democracy to become a dictator.
[02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:09.152]  That's why in a republic, there are rules, like in the NFL.
[02:39:09.152 --> 02:39:12.974]  There are rules, and those are the rules this year.
[02:39:12.974 --> 02:39:18.577]  And you can't change them.
[02:39:18.577 --> 02:39:19.578]  But he says, yeah, I can.
[02:39:21.894 --> 02:39:23.975]  A first down is whatever I say it is.
[02:39:23.975 --> 02:39:24.835]  A field goal.
[02:39:24.835 --> 02:39:26.856]  It can miss going between the poles.
[02:39:26.856 --> 02:39:27.936]  That's a field goal.
[02:39:27.936 --> 02:39:32.537]  But when the other team gets it in the poles, in between the poles, it isn't.
[02:39:32.537 --> 02:39:34.118]  I'll make up the rules as I go along.
[02:39:34.118 --> 02:39:34.958]  How's that sound?
[02:39:34.958 --> 02:39:36.799]  That is dictatorship.
[02:39:36.799 --> 02:39:43.821]  Doesn't mean he's a physical dictator like Ceausescu or Fidel Castro or Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler.
[02:39:44.201 --> 02:39:47.129]  But the office has become dictatorial.
[02:39:47.129 --> 02:39:50.137]  Are we going to make the Senate and the House ceremonial?
[02:39:50.137 --> 02:39:52.563]  Going to make the governors and the legislature ceremonial?
[02:39:54.471 --> 02:39:58.554]  The Feds, which are globalist run, they've been taken over, occupied, literally.
[02:39:58.554 --> 02:40:01.597]  They say states are ceremonial.
[02:40:01.597 --> 02:40:03.818]  Police being local are ceremonial.
[02:40:03.818 --> 02:40:05.720]  Counties are ceremonial.
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:07.461]  Your 4th Amendment's ceremonial.
[02:40:07.461 --> 02:40:08.962]  Your 2nd Amendment's ceremonial.
[02:40:08.962 --> 02:40:10.463]  Your right to travel's ceremonial.
[02:40:10.463 --> 02:40:11.104]  It's a privilege.
[02:40:11.104 --> 02:40:11.844]  It's a privilege.
[02:40:11.844 --> 02:40:15.808]  Just because they parrot that at you at the police academy, doesn't mean it's true!
[02:40:16.508 --> 02:40:20.889]  It's a load of bull, and the path it leads us to is tyranny.
[02:40:20.889 --> 02:40:26.190]  I don't care how many times violating the Constitution actually does something good.
[02:40:26.190 --> 02:40:27.630]  It doesn't matter.
[02:40:27.630 --> 02:40:31.991]  Because at the high levels, they have bad intentions.
[02:40:31.991 --> 02:40:37.652]  And so you start breaking it for little things, you're going to break it on every front.
[02:40:37.652 --> 02:40:44.373]  They're breaking it for the big things up at the top, and so people down through the entire strata are saying, I don't have to follow this anymore.
[02:40:44.373 --> 02:40:45.713]  Because, you know, nobody else follows it.
[02:40:47.227 --> 02:40:49.909]  And then society breaks down.
[02:40:49.909 --> 02:40:51.631]  And then things are unreliable.
[02:40:51.631 --> 02:40:57.095]  America, for all its problems, was one of the greatest countries to ever exist, if not the greatest, because of reliability.
[02:40:57.095 --> 02:41:02.560]  People went with who they trusted, who they knew, and who was reliable, and who would bend over backwards.
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:04.101]  That's how you build quality.
[02:41:04.101 --> 02:41:05.322]  Not what we've got going now.
[02:41:05.322 --> 02:41:06.904]  We are going the opposite direction.
[02:41:06.904 --> 02:41:07.664]  I know I'm preaching.
[02:41:07.664 --> 02:41:09.286]  I said I'll go to your calls.
[02:41:09.286 --> 02:41:11.948]  It just is disgusting to watch this happening.
[02:41:11.948 --> 02:41:12.669]  Take vaccines.
[02:41:14.048 --> 02:41:26.774]  Vaccines, 500 plus year old technology developed in Europe for smallpox, where you take some of the pus out of somebody that's got it, give it to a healthy person while they're healthy, not run down, so that their body's able to beat it.
[02:41:26.774 --> 02:41:32.116]  A lot of times you'd be given smallpox when you were healthy, you wouldn't even get sick, you'd get one pustule.
[02:41:32.116 --> 02:41:35.318]  Your body would isolate it, deal with it, instead of getting it when you were run down and dying.
[02:41:36.579 --> 02:41:42.522]  If it was killing 100 people a day in the town of London, and I was afraid it was coming down my street, I might do that to my children.
[02:41:42.522 --> 02:41:44.283]  But I'd make the decision.
[02:41:44.283 --> 02:41:50.447]  And they knew 300 years ago, 400 years ago, 500 years ago, it was dangerous.
[02:41:50.447 --> 02:41:54.569]  But the liability was, hey, my kids might die if I don't do this, they might die if I do do this.
[02:41:56.897 --> 02:42:00.599]  See, but I'm making the decision, or my local doctor is.
[02:42:00.599 --> 02:42:03.740]  And if he makes enough bad decisions, people won't go to him anymore.
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:10.323]  See, people want to go to the doctor, or go to the lawyer, or go to the roofer, who does the good job over and over again.
[02:42:10.323 --> 02:42:12.424]  Or they do a bad job, they do it right the next time.
[02:42:13.766 --> 02:42:16.108]  For whatever reason, this doctor's just got the magic touch.
[02:42:16.108 --> 02:42:18.570]  For whatever reason, this lawyer's got the magic touch.
[02:42:18.570 --> 02:42:21.332]  For whatever reason, this cop keeps solving all these cases.
[02:42:21.332 --> 02:42:22.633]  Let's make him a detective.
[02:42:22.633 --> 02:42:23.654]  He keeps solving more cases.
[02:42:23.654 --> 02:42:25.295]  Let's make him the head detective.
[02:42:25.295 --> 02:42:28.558]  That's where you promote because of skill.
[02:42:28.558 --> 02:42:32.681]  Like Admiral Nimitz came from nowhere, ended up commanding the whole Pacific Fleet.
[02:42:32.681 --> 02:42:34.423]  You don't see that nowadays.
[02:42:34.423 --> 02:42:36.565]  Some guy from a small town becoming the head admiral.
[02:42:37.737 --> 02:42:45.762]  Nimitz was in a Navy where it was about not where you came from, but what you could do and deliver.
[02:42:45.762 --> 02:42:48.123]  And that you were honorable.
[02:42:48.123 --> 02:42:53.887]  Now they promote in police departments in most areas of the country who'll shut up, who'll go along, who'll play games.
[02:42:53.887 --> 02:42:56.828]  Not who is basically psychic.
[02:42:56.828 --> 02:43:02.532]  Everybody knows that's who they used to try to get as detectives was the guys that they don't know why they know, but 99% of the time they're right.
[02:43:03.669 --> 02:43:03.990]  See that?
[02:43:03.990 --> 02:43:05.913]  Oh, they don't want detectives like that nowadays.
[02:43:05.913 --> 02:43:10.099]  They want detectives that'll play games and go along with the system.
[02:43:10.099 --> 02:43:11.421]  And when I say psychic, you know what I mean.
[02:43:11.421 --> 02:43:12.062]  Intuitive.
[02:43:13.032 --> 02:43:16.714]  Being able to take a bunch of data and not know why they integrate it, but knowing the answer.
[02:43:16.714 --> 02:43:18.134]  That's what it is in business.
[02:43:18.134 --> 02:43:19.115]  That's what it is.
[02:43:19.115 --> 02:43:21.276]  It's not just... A hunch isn't a hunch.
[02:43:21.276 --> 02:43:35.723]  A hunch is when you got a bunch of data, and you look at the probabilities, and you know people's MO, and you know how people have operated in the past, and then you look at that data, and then you go with your gut that's the extrapolation of all of that into a prime answer.
[02:43:35.723 --> 02:43:36.663]  Go with your gut!
[02:43:36.663 --> 02:43:40.265]  You think a giant government and black uniforms and cameras everywhere is good?
[02:43:40.265 --> 02:43:40.545]  It ain't.
[02:43:41.741 --> 02:43:45.030]  Oh, it's got some good uses, but it doesn't mid-term or long-term.
[02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:47.257]  It always goes bad.
[02:43:47.257 --> 02:43:49.062]  And it is bad.
[02:43:49.062 --> 02:43:49.884]  I'm really preaching now.
[02:43:52.403 --> 02:43:57.708]  We do have the clip of Alan Greenspan on PBS shooting his mouth off so calmly.
[02:43:57.708 --> 02:43:59.470]  Well, what is Congress's role with the Fed?
[02:43:59.470 --> 02:44:00.531]  There is none, my boy!
[02:44:00.531 --> 02:44:03.093]  We're a completely independent agency.
[02:44:03.093 --> 02:44:06.116]  See, not saying of government, just saying agency.
[02:44:06.116 --> 02:44:07.017]  We're the Fed.
[02:44:07.017 --> 02:44:08.358]  We're the agency.
[02:44:08.358 --> 02:44:09.620]  It's a counterfeit.
[02:44:09.620 --> 02:44:10.701]  It's a fraud.
[02:44:10.701 --> 02:44:12.102]  Just like Obama.
[02:44:12.102 --> 02:44:12.783]  Let's go to that clip.
[02:44:14.158 --> 02:44:27.877]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:44:29.298 --> 02:44:49.662]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[02:44:49.662 --> 02:44:51.023]  That clip only has 3,000 views.
[02:44:51.023 --> 02:44:57.604]  It should have 5 million views, 10 million views, 20... There's the former head of the Federal Reserve calmly going,
[02:44:59.349 --> 02:45:01.432]  Well, we're an independent agency, implying he's government.
[02:45:01.432 --> 02:45:02.214]  He doesn't say have government.
[02:45:02.214 --> 02:45:05.679]  Independent agency.
[02:45:05.679 --> 02:45:11.328]  And then he goes on to say, the role is, we can do whatever we want.
[02:45:11.328 --> 02:45:14.252]  And as long as government does what we says, that's proper.
[02:45:15.541 --> 02:45:30.510]  I'm king of the universe, and as long as you do what six mainly foreign banks say that took over and conned you dumb American hayseeds in 1913, that's what he's really thinking, you know, as long as you do what we say, you're doing a great job.
[02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:36.934]  As long as I'm king of the universe, and you do everything I say, and I'm totally secret, and I'm above the law, and I can take
[02:45:37.974 --> 02:45:39.396]  47 trillion dollars of U.S.
[02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:50.565]  taxpayer money that they put onto our debt in derivatives, and give it to foreign banks, most of the bailout money, as long as you let us totally screw you, seven ways to Sunday, that's proper.
[02:45:50.565 --> 02:46:04.897]  I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse, but that whatever executive actions that I take,
[02:46:06.108 --> 02:46:06.929]  Did you hear that?
[02:46:06.929 --> 02:46:07.549]  That was Obama.
[02:46:07.549 --> 02:46:11.211]  He said that yesterday and he had another press conference today saying the same thing.
[02:46:11.211 --> 02:46:12.012]  So what he's saying is...
[02:46:31.397 --> 02:46:37.683]  I will do whatever I want executively, but if you send me a bill I agree with, I'll sign it, and then you can be a party to it.
[02:46:37.683 --> 02:46:49.674]  That's like walking up to a woman in a restaurant and saying, if you have sex with me, it won't be rape, but if you don't have sex with me, I'm gonna hit you over the head and rape you on the table.
[02:46:49.674 --> 02:46:52.277]  This can be consensual, or I can rape you, is what Obama's saying.
[02:46:53.817 --> 02:47:11.584]  This all flies in the face of logic, and the reason they're so bold, saying you didn't build your business, 2 plus 2 equals 5, dads are bad, the state owns your kids, Hillary says businesses don't hire people, is they're trying to get the public used to hearing crazy stuff.
[02:47:11.584 --> 02:47:17.226]  They're waging war on reality.
[02:47:17.226 --> 02:47:17.766]  That's what they're doing.
[02:47:18.584 --> 02:47:20.486]  All right, I'm going to go to your calls here.
[02:47:20.486 --> 02:47:23.028]  Rob has been holding the longest.
[02:47:23.028 --> 02:47:25.891]  William, Rob, Tim, John, and others.
[02:47:25.891 --> 02:47:28.834]  We're going to go to break here in a moment, come right back to you in this next six-minute segment.
[02:47:28.834 --> 02:47:42.047]  I'll do some customary overdrive to finish up with those calls, and I'll try to get into the science of hipsters as well in a minute or two of that overdrive and more on what this economist said, but I've got to get to that right now.
[02:47:43.424 --> 02:47:45.065]  And, of course, I can't find it in my stack.
[02:47:45.065 --> 02:47:46.005]  Oh, here it is.
[02:47:46.005 --> 02:47:50.927]  This is an amazing article by Bloomberg because it's the establishment saying it.
[02:47:50.927 --> 02:47:52.628]  And this article came out November 4th.
[02:47:52.628 --> 02:47:54.409]  I haven't gotten around to covering it yet.
[02:47:54.409 --> 02:47:55.770]  Singer Elliott says, U.S.
[02:47:55.770 --> 02:47:58.431]  growth optimism unwarranted as data cooked.
[02:47:58.431 --> 02:48:07.235]  And he goes on to say that we live in a, quote, totally fake economy headed for a, quote, deep crash.
[02:48:07.235 --> 02:48:09.636]  Deep means not just in fiat numbers, but deep.
[02:48:10.965 --> 02:48:13.827]  The real economy in most sectors has been in a crash.
[02:48:13.827 --> 02:48:16.049]  I mean, everybody knows it costs more money.
[02:48:16.049 --> 02:48:20.352]  Everything's healthcare, energy's going up on average.
[02:48:20.352 --> 02:48:22.714]  I mean, I just hate poverty.
[02:48:22.714 --> 02:48:24.556]  I hate seeing people not doing good.
[02:48:24.556 --> 02:48:28.459]  These globalists want to see you doing bad because then they can run your life.
[02:48:28.459 --> 02:48:32.522]  And Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corps said optimism on U.S.
[02:48:32.522 --> 02:48:40.408]  growth is misguided and economic data understate inflation and overstate growth and central bank policies the past six years aren't sustainable.
[02:48:42.102 --> 02:48:54.999]  And by the way, almost all the big fund managers, as you know, have been quietly getting their own money completely out the last four or five years and into hard assets, farmland and infrastructure and energy and things like that you'll still have to have.
[02:48:54.999 --> 02:48:59.024]  And he basically goes into all that, that when confidence is lost,
[02:48:59.665 --> 02:49:03.688]  That loss could be severe, sudden, and simultaneous across a number of markets and sectors.
[02:49:03.688 --> 02:49:09.773]  And he goes on to say the zero interest rates of the Federal Reserve have fueled a false economy and that it's just going to be disastrous.
[02:49:09.773 --> 02:49:12.876]  I mean, of course, you've already heard that a million times here.
[02:49:12.876 --> 02:49:18.821]  Common sense says that, but we're sitting on top of powder keg.
[02:49:18.821 --> 02:49:28.048]  And let me tell you, when the welfare checks to 100 million people, it's 101 million that are on some type of subsidy or more.
[02:49:29.056 --> 02:49:32.097]  And 50-something million on food stamps?
[02:49:32.097 --> 02:49:33.218]  That's federal.
[02:49:33.218 --> 02:49:33.898]  Federal card.
[02:49:33.898 --> 02:49:36.059]  There's a bunch of other supplementals.
[02:49:36.059 --> 02:49:39.120]  It's way over 50 million.
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:49.465]  When the food doesn't get delivered, or the money on their card won't buy it because of inflation, or because of shortages, America is primed to explode.
[02:49:49.465 --> 02:49:52.566]  Because there's not just spoiled yuppies and spoiled rich people.
[02:49:52.566 --> 02:49:55.167]  Our poor, who don't work, are incredibly spoiled.
[02:49:56.340 --> 02:50:05.446]  And then there's all the poor people that work two, three, four jobs that are holding the country up that have to live around all these welfare people and put up with them and all their arrogance.
[02:50:05.446 --> 02:50:06.307]  So I've seen the statistics.
[02:50:06.307 --> 02:50:14.413]  You'll have the working family with like no crime and then you have the welfare family next door that's robbing their house and beating their kid up and their kids in a gang.
[02:50:14.413 --> 02:50:16.054]  People aren't going to put up with this stuff.
[02:50:17.788 --> 02:50:23.731]  As it unravels and as the welfare heads try to come over and rob the working poor, it's going to be explosive.
[02:50:23.731 --> 02:50:24.992]  Let me just say this.
[02:50:24.992 --> 02:50:27.773]  I know why the cops are buying armored vehicles and all the rest of it.
[02:50:27.773 --> 02:50:30.474]  I just don't like them training to fight the Tea Party and gun owners.
[02:50:30.474 --> 02:50:32.355]  They're trying to save the country.
[02:50:32.355 --> 02:50:37.777]  But no amount of armored vehicles are going to stop the depression hitting your family as well.
[02:50:37.777 --> 02:50:39.778]  And I know people in the government know this.
[02:50:39.778 --> 02:50:41.639]  It's just a horrible situation.
[02:50:41.639 --> 02:50:44.120]  Foreign banks engineered this.
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:46.241]  And their solutions to the crash that's coming
[02:50:47.475 --> 02:50:48.935]  ...are gonna be giving them more power.
[02:50:48.935 --> 02:50:50.936]  So all I can say is we need to reverse that.
[02:50:50.936 --> 02:51:00.397]  Don't forget the incredible supplements we have available at InfoWarsLife.com, like Survival Shield X2, discounted 10% off in the Bio Defense Pack.

[02:51:24.653 --> 02:51:27.035]  I am a 47 year old female and had a heart attack in 2005.
[02:51:34.781 --> 02:51:36.842]  This is Alice from New Jersey.
[02:51:36.842 --> 02:51:40.023]  I still get angina, even with four stints.
[02:51:40.023 --> 02:51:42.945]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[02:51:42.945 --> 02:51:47.967]  The very first day after taking Heart and Body Extract, the chest pain was gone.
[02:51:47.967 --> 02:51:49.928]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.
[02:51:49.928 --> 02:51:57.871]  Learn the secrets of an effective, natural, 100% organic nutritional supplement for a healthy heart and circulation at HBExtract.com.
[02:51:59.642 --> 02:52:00.983]  The experts are clear.
[02:52:00.983 --> 02:52:08.068]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:52:08.068 --> 02:52:14.352]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.

[02:52:27.601 --> 02:52:28.621]  Not our iodine.
[02:52:28.621 --> 02:52:34.985]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:52:59.451 --> 02:53:00.511]  Quantitative easing.
[02:53:00.511 --> 02:53:02.612]  Unemployment at depression levels.
[02:53:02.612 --> 02:53:04.673]  Europe financial system falling apart.
[02:53:04.673 --> 02:53:05.933]  China getting out of U.S.
[02:53:05.933 --> 02:53:06.693]  Treasuries.
[02:53:06.693 --> 02:53:14.056]  At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at $11 trillion, gold trading around $850 per ounce.
[02:53:14.056 --> 02:53:20.878]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1,600 per ounce.
[02:53:20.878 --> 02:53:23.719]  The $20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[02:53:23.959 --> 02:53:28.101]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[02:53:28.101 --> 02:53:30.782]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[02:53:30.782 --> 02:53:36.545]  A hundred years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your own gold standard.
[02:53:36.545 --> 02:53:38.346]  Don't be fooled with paper promises.
[02:53:38.346 --> 02:53:42.208]  Get Midas Resources ten reasons to buy gold free by calling 800-686-2237.

[02:54:06.744 --> 02:54:10.107]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:54:10.107 --> 02:54:11.508]  I don't get into hipsters if I have time.
[02:54:11.508 --> 02:54:13.790]  I already made you a whole special on the Nightly News about it.
[02:54:13.790 --> 02:54:17.494]  It's so important to understand how they manipulate people.
[02:54:17.494 --> 02:54:21.017]  I mean, if something's hip and you like it, then go with it.
[02:54:21.017 --> 02:54:23.480]  But don't adopt it because everybody else is adopting it.
[02:54:24.761 --> 02:54:29.762]  Within that, feminism, gun control, Obama cult.
[02:54:29.762 --> 02:54:39.505]  Like, don't make this Republican takeover about how they're the new celebrities and they're up there like a bunch of narcissists and they won and they're great and we're gonna rub the Democrats' noses in it.
[02:54:39.505 --> 02:54:41.486]  How about you reverse the damage to the country?
[02:54:41.486 --> 02:54:44.687]  How about you be servants?
[02:54:44.687 --> 02:54:48.668]  How about it not be a cult where we feel like we're winners now because they got in?
[02:54:50.435 --> 02:55:01.022]  We're not winners, we just repudiated the vanguard of the globalist takeover, and now their buddies are filling the slot acting like they're not running the same operation.
[02:55:01.022 --> 02:55:05.846]  We have to fully identify them, radicalize our rhetoric to the level of reality.
[02:55:05.846 --> 02:55:16.754]  Notice they're always on CNN, Fox, MSNBC saying, don't be radical, do what mainland Republicans say, work with the Democrats, we need to be nice, we need to... No!
[02:55:16.754 --> 02:55:19.696]  They're telling you, obviously, tactics that'll fail.
[02:55:20.296 --> 02:55:21.857]  It's so obvious.
[02:55:21.857 --> 02:55:24.418]  It's so frustrating.
[02:55:24.418 --> 02:55:28.200]  How am I able to reach 15-20 million people a week?
[02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:30.221]  Conservatively, with all our platforms.
[02:55:30.221 --> 02:55:35.063]  It's not because I play patty cake and regurgitate party line.
[02:55:35.063 --> 02:55:39.145]  I regurgitate common sense party line that's worked over and over again.
[02:55:39.145 --> 02:55:40.526]  That's why my job is so easy.
[02:55:40.526 --> 02:55:41.386]  Tell the truth.
[02:55:41.386 --> 02:55:42.567]  Promote common sense.
[02:55:42.567 --> 02:55:46.789]  But see, in a world of tyranny, that is basically heresy.
[02:55:47.790 --> 02:55:49.331]  Well fine, I'm a heretic then.
[02:55:49.331 --> 02:55:51.452]  I don't worship at the altar of the state.
[02:55:51.452 --> 02:55:52.433]  And you don't either.
[02:55:52.433 --> 02:55:53.633]  So let's get out there.
[02:55:53.633 --> 02:55:55.554]  We've got the answers.
[02:55:55.554 --> 02:56:05.680]  We shouldn't be haughty or arrogant, but we should be a bit commanding, a bit imperious about all this, because we know how to save the ship.
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:08.782]  And so, notice they're imperious to us, so we sit down and shut up.
[02:56:08.782 --> 02:56:09.322]  Uh-uh.
[02:56:09.322 --> 02:56:10.743]  That's over with.
[02:56:10.743 --> 02:56:12.484]  Go ahead, Rob from Missouri.
[02:56:12.484 --> 02:56:13.205]  You're on the air.
[02:56:13.205 --> 02:56:13.585]  Go ahead.
[02:56:17.776 --> 02:56:21.517]  Yeah, he's talking, his audio's real low.
[02:56:21.517 --> 02:56:25.098]  I can't hear him, we're gonna have to let it... Yeah, we had bad audio there.
[02:56:25.098 --> 02:56:27.059]  Sorry, Rob, I could barely hear you.
[02:56:27.059 --> 02:56:28.420]  William in Virginia, go ahead.
[02:56:28.420 --> 02:56:33.001]  Yeah, we got a phone system problem.
[02:56:33.001 --> 02:56:34.862]  So, that's what it is.
[02:56:34.862 --> 02:56:37.142]  Network may be able to hear him.
[02:56:37.142 --> 02:56:40.103]  I'm not able, I can barely hear him in the background.
[02:56:40.103 --> 02:56:42.704]  Yeah, yeah, we've lost phone system.
[02:56:42.704 --> 02:56:44.565]  Sorry, folks, that's one way to not get on air.
[02:56:45.674 --> 02:56:47.375]  I do have my hipsters stacked, but I almost don't wanna
[02:57:06.428 --> 02:57:07.989]  You know, not do justice to it.
[02:57:07.989 --> 02:57:10.391]  And I want to do a whole special report.
[02:57:10.391 --> 02:57:13.653]  If not, Friday's the worst day to let something out.
[02:57:13.653 --> 02:57:15.854]  But maybe I should do a report for the Nightly News tonight.
[02:57:15.854 --> 02:57:18.196]  I just want to do it justice.
[02:57:18.196 --> 02:57:19.797]  Here's the article, though, that I've been mentioning.
[02:57:19.797 --> 02:57:22.539]  We'll get it linked up on InfoWars.com.
[02:57:22.539 --> 02:57:24.060]  The science of hipsters.
[02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:29.344]  Mathematical formula shows that trying to look different ultimately makes everyone look the same.
[02:57:30.967 --> 02:57:34.568]  Hipster Paradox states, trying to be different makes people look the same.
[02:57:34.568 --> 02:57:39.049]  Experts created a formula that proves, I want to get this guy on, why the phenomenon takes place.
[02:57:39.049 --> 02:57:43.370]  He said there is a delay between the time a trend begins to gain traction.
[02:57:43.370 --> 02:57:46.811]  This is because people can't be aware of what others decide in real time.
[02:57:46.811 --> 02:57:52.313]  As a result, hipsters gradually realize the decision has been made while making the same decision and ultimately end up
[02:57:52.873 --> 02:57:53.894]  Conforming.
[02:57:53.894 --> 02:57:58.756]  True hipsters would need to be consistently changing and adapting their style.
[02:57:58.756 --> 02:58:02.198]  Studies suggest this is impossible and too difficult to maintain.
[02:58:02.198 --> 02:58:07.962]  Hey, how about you just go with what's timeless or with what you like?
[02:58:07.962 --> 02:58:11.123]  My hair is the same it was that was falling out when I was 15.
[02:58:11.123 --> 02:58:13.445]  I buy the same shoes.
[02:58:15.131 --> 02:58:20.395]  Same watches, same cars, same everything.
[02:58:20.395 --> 02:58:29.523]  I go to the same restaurants, but I do new stuff and I'm always adding new things, but I just cannot imagine, hey, you know, those shoes are out of style.
[02:58:29.523 --> 02:58:34.247]  You know what, I'm going to wear my cowboy boots and you can do whatever you want.
[02:58:34.247 --> 02:58:36.949]  You may go to hell, I will go to Texas, to quote Davy Crockett.
[02:58:36.949 --> 02:58:37.810]  I'm just joking.
[02:58:37.810 --> 02:58:40.352]  I'm going to come back in overdrive and see if the phone system's working.
[02:58:40.352 --> 02:58:44.095]  PrisonPlanet.tv, Nightly News Tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:58:44.335 --> 02:58:46.519]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:50.546 --> 02:58:54.187]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:58:54.187 --> 02:58:58.468]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:58:58.468 --> 02:59:00.248]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:59:00.248 --> 02:59:08.110]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:59:08.110 --> 02:59:09.250]  But for how long?
[02:59:09.250 --> 02:59:11.450]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:59:11.450 --> 02:59:15.891]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:59:15.891 --> 02:59:17.752]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:59:17.752 --> 02:59:18.712]  Just won't quit.
[02:59:20.103 --> 02:59:30.670]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:59:30.670 --> 02:59:37.134]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:59:37.134 --> 02:59:39.476]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:59:39.476 --> 02:59:42.558]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.

[02:59:52.273 --> 03:00:02.001]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:02.001 --> 03:00:10.388]  Six bayonets!
[03:00:12.663 --> 03:00:20.009]  You know, about an hour ago, I knew we were linked on DrudgeReport.com, but I got busy and didn't go confirm it with my eyeballs.
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:37.202]  But I was looking at Paul Watson's article with like 300 comments.
[03:00:37.202 --> 03:00:40.564]  Obama caught ordering press to cover up Ebola.
[03:00:40.564 --> 03:00:44.666]  And then I saw it about an hour ago jump from 300 to like 800 and something instantly.
[03:00:44.666 --> 03:00:46.548]  And I went, oh that must be linked on Drudge.
[03:00:46.548 --> 03:00:49.249]  You don't have like 5,000 comments by morning.
[03:00:49.249 --> 03:00:51.751]  But good job Matt Drudge.
[03:00:51.751 --> 03:00:55.574]  That's why people go to DrudgeReport.com.
[03:00:55.574 --> 03:01:00.217]  It's because we get video of the Border Patrol loading illegals on buses and giving them vouchers and admitting it.
[03:01:01.089 --> 03:01:04.590]  Water Patrol's the ones that called us to tell us to come see it.
[03:01:04.590 --> 03:01:08.011]  And Drudge will pick it up, but the New York Times took a month to.
[03:01:08.011 --> 03:01:09.492]  Same thing here.
[03:01:09.492 --> 03:01:10.312]  See media.
[03:01:10.312 --> 03:01:13.933]  Journalism's about being on the cutting edge and telling people what's going on.
[03:01:13.933 --> 03:01:15.854]  People want to be informed, not lying to them.
[03:01:15.854 --> 03:01:20.155]  This whole article is about Obama caught ordering press to cover up Ebola.
[03:01:21.528 --> 03:01:23.489]  And Drudge is linked to that.
[03:01:23.489 --> 03:01:25.010]  I changed the headline.
[03:01:25.010 --> 03:01:27.191]  Paul did have a more professional headline.
[03:01:27.191 --> 03:01:30.852]  We might even change it back because it's going to get so much attention.
[03:01:30.852 --> 03:01:36.395]  Dealing with the fact that the press admits that they are lying about potential Ebola cases under orders.
[03:01:36.395 --> 03:01:40.176]  In fact, you can go to the URL and see what it actually said.
[03:01:40.176 --> 03:01:44.338]  Media agrees not to report on suspicious Ebola cases in the U.S.
[03:01:44.338 --> 03:01:48.160]  But really, what would the headline on that be?
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:50.761]  Because it's so sensational, but how do you properly state it?
[03:01:54.965 --> 03:02:01.290]  Press admits that they are in active cover-up of potential Ebola cases?
[03:02:01.290 --> 03:02:03.491]  I mean, I guess it is the Obama administration.
[03:02:03.491 --> 03:02:07.154]  I guess the proper headline is, Obama Administration Caught Ordering Press.
[03:02:07.154 --> 03:02:07.674]  There you go.
[03:02:07.674 --> 03:02:10.636]  Obama Administration.
[03:02:10.636 --> 03:02:11.477]  That's the great part about this.
[03:02:11.477 --> 03:02:15.820]  We can edit this live on air, make it even better, more accurate, and then be transparent with you.
[03:02:16.710 --> 03:02:18.050]  But it's just such a big deal.
[03:02:18.050 --> 03:02:20.991]  In fact, I was about to ask, why is no one picking this up?
[03:02:20.991 --> 03:02:22.092]  This is so big.
[03:02:22.092 --> 03:02:30.554]  Forbes admits this, and we have medical doctors saying it's going on, and police saying it's going on, and firefighters saying it's going on, and EMTs say it's going on.
[03:02:30.554 --> 03:02:36.976]  And when we broke this a few weeks ago, and now it's been confirmed again, their answer was, oh, that's that crazy guy Alex.
[03:02:36.976 --> 03:02:37.476]  Well, you know what?
[03:02:37.476 --> 03:02:39.177]  I have gone kind of crazy.
[03:02:39.177 --> 03:02:44.598]  You focus on this stuff every day, you start freaking out how crazy the system is.
[03:02:44.598 --> 03:02:45.959]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:02:45.959 --> 03:02:46.259]  Welcome.
[03:02:47.279 --> 03:02:48.981]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:02:48.981 --> 03:02:50.362]  Good, go ahead.
[03:02:50.362 --> 03:02:52.585]  About the cover-up with Ebola.
[03:02:52.585 --> 03:02:59.932]  Now, isn't there a section in the Obamacare where they are going to chip everybody?
[03:02:59.932 --> 03:03:04.877]  What better way than to keep it secret, let it spread, let it get so bad that there's mandatory
[03:03:05.740 --> 03:03:08.842]  Vaccinations, and then they slip the chip in them.
[03:03:08.842 --> 03:03:14.545]  Well, they've got nanotech microscopic sized chips now, so they have been testing putting them in vaccines.
[03:03:14.545 --> 03:03:16.686]  They're in hundreds of new pills coming out.
[03:03:16.686 --> 03:03:17.767]  Well, you're taking an opiate.
[03:03:17.767 --> 03:03:20.128]  We're going to track you with live chips in your belly.
[03:03:20.128 --> 03:03:25.811]  So yes, it's all coming out, and it's in Obamacare to pay for the chipping of patients.
[03:03:25.811 --> 03:03:29.233]  It doesn't force it, it just pays, and that's covered under insurance.
[03:03:30.279 --> 03:03:31.342]  All right, we're out of time.
[03:03:31.342 --> 03:03:32.203]  Great job to the crew.
[03:03:32.203 --> 03:03:33.867]  God bless you all.
[03:03:33.867 --> 03:03:38.477]  We'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock Central, Lord willing, in Full Horse Nightly News with our great team.
[03:03:38.477 --> 03:03:40.421]  And our team is the engine of this operation.
