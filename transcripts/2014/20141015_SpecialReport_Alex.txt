[00:00:11.118 --> 00:00:18.082]  Fox News celebrities are floating a trial balloon for FEMA camps that they've now rebranded as Ebola camps.
[00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.062]  Here's what they propose.
[00:00:19.463 --> 00:00:23.965]  I think they should set up special centers for just Ebola in each state.
[00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:28.187]  They shouldn't be letting people go into regular hospitals where it could be spread.
[00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:36.372]  For this specific disease, we should have a special facility with specially trained people who know exactly how to deal with this.
[00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:36.732]  In each city?
[00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:37.933]  In each city.
[00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:45.018]  That way it's not spread, and when the person walks in, they know what they're looking for, they know if they find it, they know how to contain it.
[00:00:45.198 --> 00:00:50.583]  He probably doesn't want to do it, but Rudy Giuliani would be perfect for this particular role.
[00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:53.885]  Why not put in Fox contributor Oliver North?
[00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:59.410]  He's the guy that originally gave us the blueprint for martial law in FEMA camps back in 1984 when he wrote Rex 84.
[00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:14.459]  Have you seen anyone on Fox News or any mainstream media suggest that there should be an independent review and hearing for people that they want to quarantine into these camps to ensure that it's legitimate, that it's not being abused?
[00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:16.900]  No, you haven't heard anybody say that.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:29.147]  As a matter of fact, we've just seen Obama in July give himself by executive fiat the power to apprehend and detain anyone that they believe has the potential to become sick.
[00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:34.888]  This is the NDAA, indefinite detention by the military on steroids.
[00:01:35.388 --> 00:01:36.649]  And then of course there's the health issues.
[00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:45.750]  How do we keep people who may be misdiagnosed for Ebola, who may simply have a fever or flu, from being locked up with people who do have Ebola?
[00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:47.431]  Contracting it, spreading it.
[00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:56.733]  The idea that this actress puts out there that people would voluntarily go to these places, that they would accurately self-diagnose themselves as having Ebola,
[00:01:57.473 --> 00:02:01.640]  No one is going to voluntarily go to what will become death camps.
[00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:05.486]  Our government declares no-fly zones at the drop of a hat.
[00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:12.614]  They isolate entire countries using no-fly zones, using embargoes, and they do it for political and economic reasons.
[00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:22.256]  But they won't isolate these countries with a pandemic that at the current unabated rate of growth will expand to 5 to 15 percent of the population.
[00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:26.197]  Quite frankly, our government wants this to get out of hand.
[00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:27.738]  They could do something about it.
[00:02:27.778 --> 00:02:32.099]  Let's look at a third world country and what they had the will and the ability to do.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.283]  This is the area right now where this is going on the hottest.
[00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:41.988]  Of course, Guinea is where it started, Sierra Leone and Liberia is still growing exponentially.
[00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.193]  Now, bordering Liberia, where it is the worst, is the Ivory Coast.
[00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:52.459]  They typically have migrant workers cross this border during chocolate season.
[00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:58.382]  They're going to shut down that crop, that harvest, by blocking this from migrant workers.
[00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:02.185]  They have the ability and the will to close their open borders.
[00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:08.689]  They will take the economic hit, but our government won't, because they put economics above the population's health.
[00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:11.250]  Now, there's another lesson to be had from this.
[00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.833]  We can look at the story of two countries here, Liberia and Nigeria.
[00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:22.197]  Now, in the one case, in Nigeria, this is not contiguous with the countries that are currently having the outbreak.
[00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:23.158]  They're way over here.
[00:03:23.178 --> 00:03:27.621]  Nigeria is over here, but it was brought in, airborne, on an airplane.
[00:03:28.201 --> 00:03:31.342]  One man lied his way into Nigeria.
[00:03:31.523 --> 00:03:33.904]  He was very sick by the time he got off the plane.
[00:03:33.944 --> 00:03:36.525]  His symptoms manifested while he was in travel.
[00:03:36.865 --> 00:03:45.488]  That's something for us to remember because when people are traveling from this area to Western countries, they have journeys that take anywhere to go to the United States.
[00:03:45.548 --> 00:03:48.370]  It takes up to 33 hours and multiple stops.
[00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.031]  He got sick on his journey, got out, was very sick.
[00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:53.652]  That created a small epidemic.
[00:03:54.392 --> 00:04:00.814]  He gave it to 20 other people, 8 of whom subsequently died, but they contained that single case.
[00:04:01.254 --> 00:04:07.415]  So much like the United States, Nigeria has Ebola introduced to it by a single person traveling by air.
[00:04:07.755 --> 00:04:08.775]  How did they contain it?
[00:04:09.256 --> 00:04:11.676]  Well, they used rapid contract tracing.
[00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:15.097]  They looked at primary, secondary, and tertiary contacts.
[00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:17.458]  They isolated and watched those people.
[00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.841]  That turned out to be 898 people.
[00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:24.784]  Have you seen that kind of work done by the CDC in America?
[00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:25.665]  I haven't.
[00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:28.027]  Contrast that to Liberia.
[00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:33.411]  Right now, in Liberia, there have been 4,076 people who have contracted Ebola.
[00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:35.713]  So far, there's been 2,300 deaths.
[00:04:35.953 --> 00:04:37.254]  Many people are still sick.
[00:04:37.314 --> 00:04:39.516]  Their casualty rate is 70%.
[00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:41.778]  What did they do differently?
[00:04:42.634 --> 00:04:44.614]  Well, they had open borders.
[00:04:44.874 --> 00:04:47.855]  They had politicians telling them not to worry.
[00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:49.635]  It's not as serious as it appears.
[00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:59.057]  And they have actually censored the news media, threatening reporters, threatening health care workers to not talk about this, threatening to arrest people.
[00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:01.397]  They've also suspended elections this week.
[00:05:01.637 --> 00:05:03.058]  Which country do we look like?
[00:05:03.158 --> 00:05:06.518]  Is it more like Nigeria or is it more like Liberia?
[00:05:06.718 --> 00:05:10.019]  And once we get to a pandemic like they've got in Liberia, of course,
[00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.243]  Fox News is presenting the FEMA camps.
[00:05:13.544 --> 00:05:14.646]  We'll call them Ebola camps.
[00:05:15.227 --> 00:05:16.890]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:31.843]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:42.052]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:42.352 --> 00:05:46.056]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:05:46.656 --> 00:05:51.321]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:57.927]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:05:58.247 --> 00:06:00.529]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.632]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:09.518]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWar.
[00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:16.625]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
