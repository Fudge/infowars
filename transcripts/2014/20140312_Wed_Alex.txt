[00:00:05.063 --> 00:00:09.906]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.906 --> 00:00:11.507]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:13.048]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:17.231]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:21.314]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:35.104]  Two buildings collapse after explosion in Harlem.
[00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:36.004]  At least one dead.
[00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.826]  Quote, we saw people flying out the windows.
[00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:40.707]  There's shocking video of it.
[00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.128]  We're going to be showing to TV viewers.
[00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:44.890]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.991]  The video's up on Infowars.com.
[00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:49.192]  Still trying to figure out what that is.
[00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:49.812]  A gas main?
[00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:50.173]  Who knows?
[00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:53.535]  But they're saying a drone was spotted flying over it.
[00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:56.737]  CBS News is reporting.
[00:00:57.805 --> 00:00:59.928]  So, uh, we will, uh, see what's happening there.
[00:00:59.928 --> 00:01:13.285]  You know, they've had cases, uh, in the news, uh, where a gas main goes off, they think it's another 9-11 in New York, or you've seen where a steam boiler exploded and shot a bunch of hot steam out of, uh, some manhole covers, and they thought that
[00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:26.020]  Al Qaeda had attacked and I mean who could blame them after the huge mind control event that was the staged inside job that was the September 11th attacks that anyway you slice it has been used to take our liberties.
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.204]  So two dead after explosion, fire, levels, buildings in East Harlem.
[00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:37.691]  At least 17 others injured as hundreds of firefighters battle blaze and then afterwards a drone CBS reports was seen flying over.
[00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:39.233]  Those drones that don't exist
[00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:57.957]  When I told you about them 15 years ago, already operating domestically, five years ago operating domestically, the drones spying on farmers, the drones spying on small business owners, which they now all admit are operating along with the satellites in high altitude blimps, flames and smoke were sent
[00:01:58.658 --> 00:02:04.043]  Billowing into the air after an explosion leveled two buildings in East Harlem Wednesday.
[00:02:04.043 --> 00:02:10.669]  And we can show those articles just by clicking on them and putting them on screen for folks that are watching.
[00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.374]  Killing two people and injuring more than a dozen people.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:28.940]  Continuing here, the cause of the blast is still unclear, but Con Edison said crews are responding in the area to report of gas odor just prior to the explosion.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.842]  And again, probably
[00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:40.920]  A gas main explosion which last time I checked killed more than 400 people a year in the United States.
[00:02:49.426 --> 00:03:01.258]  Great white sharks kill about five a year globally, most of them in Australia or off the coast of California, but people are afraid to swim in oceans worldwide, even where the great whites do not live, because of the movie Jaws.
[00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:11.248]  Just like terrorism kills only a few hundred people a year by its classical definition, but our whole way of life is being ended because they want to keep us safe from it.
[00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.371]  Meanwhile, honeybees kill more people than terrorism.
[00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:18.133]  I just keep harping on that because it's all a hoax.
[00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:20.654]  The call came in at 9.13 a.m.
[00:03:20.654 --> 00:03:27.378]  from a resident who reported smelling gas inside the apartment, but the resident indicated the odor may have been coming from outside the building.
[00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:35.703]  Con Edison spokesman Sidney Alvarez said two Con Edison crews were dispatched about 9.15 a.m.
[00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:38.745]  and arrived just after the explosion occurred.
[00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:47.793]  So, we will continue to track all of that and cover all of that, but I'm guessing it's a gas main.
[00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:51.877]  You know, they defused a pressure cooker that wasn't a bomb in Boston yesterday.
[00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:54.299]  Had lots of panicking and freaking out.
[00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.265]  Paul Watson has an article about where Homeland Security does SWAT raids now and locks down whole neighborhoods and points guns at everyone.
[00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:03.267]  Kinda like the police in LA randomly shooting up vehicles.
[00:04:04.048 --> 00:04:08.850]  Full of white women in cars when they're looking for a black guy in a truck.
[00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:21.335]  I mean, it just shows that government itself is living in this panic zone and really training everyone to lock everything down like a prisoner lockdown in this country.
[00:04:21.335 --> 00:04:27.877]  Paul Watson is going to be discussing that with us coming up as well in the next segment.
[00:04:27.877 --> 00:04:29.198]  There's going to be an armed march.
[00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:36.141]  Uh, at South by Southwest starting on Congress at noon today down at Congress in San Jacinto.
[00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:37.661]  And then there's going to be another big one this Saturday.
[00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:40.303]  We're going to have reporters live down there today.
[00:04:40.303 --> 00:04:45.645]  And finally, because we had to reschedule with her once and she had to reschedule, Target.
[00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:51.208]  Kathleen Wiley, Willie, um, caught in the crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:54.469]  Somebody's been a victim of the Clintons.
[00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.571]  Uh, we'll be joining us because we look, we're looking at Hillary being El Presidente or running for president.
[00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:03.606]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:05:03.606 --> 00:05:06.027]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:05:06.027 --> 00:05:14.630]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:22.573]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:30.944]  Super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:05:30.944 --> 00:05:38.594]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:05:38.974 --> 00:05:45.317]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:05:45.317 --> 00:05:54.060]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[00:05:58.242 --> 00:05:59.103]  InfoWarsLife.com
[00:06:00.203 --> 00:06:09.294]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:06:09.294 --> 00:06:17.403]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:06:17.683 --> 00:06:22.566]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:06:22.566 --> 00:06:29.351]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:36.516]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:43.560]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.483]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:06:47.503 --> 00:06:48.083]  The facts are in.
[00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:48.884]  The studies are legion.
[00:06:48.884 --> 00:06:51.445]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family.
[00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:10.195]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:14.018]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:07:14.018 --> 00:07:14.599]  Simple.
[00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:19.324]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:07:19.324 --> 00:07:24.769]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:30.556]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:07:30.556 --> 00:07:41.028]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:07:41.348 --> 00:07:45.929]  Let's take a stand against the Globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:48.089]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:53.650]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.051]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:07:58.051 --> 00:07:59.331]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:11.778 --> 00:08:15.362]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:19.526]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.953 --> 00:08:34.477]  Two buildings have collapsed after an explosion in New York City.
[00:08:34.477 --> 00:08:35.919]  At least two people are dead.
[00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.442]  We quote saw people flying out the windows.
[00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:47.274]  Witnesses say there is video of it that if you're a TV viewer I will show you some raw footage of with the explosion.
[00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:55.311]  And again, Con Edison reports that hours before they were getting reports of a strong odor of gas in the area.
[00:08:55.311 --> 00:08:58.233]  Hands down, it's going to be a gas explosion.
[00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:02.497]  But it does bring up images of 9-11 to see what looks like dust.
[00:09:02.497 --> 00:09:08.022]  It's really just smoke billowing through the apartment blocks in skyscrapers.
[00:09:09.008 --> 00:09:11.810]  And they are now conjuring images of 9-11.
[00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.212]  Rangel, the congressman, says, our community's 9-11.
[00:09:15.212 --> 00:09:21.457]  And of course, a drone was spotted, CBS News reports, flying over right after it happened.
[00:09:21.457 --> 00:09:26.760]  So, all part of living in the new homeland.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:35.967]  Speaking of things like the Boston bombing, where the police militarized come in and lock down literally half the city of Boston.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:51.474]  Going into people's houses, pointing guns at them, pointing guns at people in their cars who didn't even look like the suspect, grabbing women by the hair, shoving them on the ground, just any excuse to stomp around, take control of a whole area, and then of course, he was outside the cordon area in a boat.
[00:09:52.034 --> 00:09:54.956]  Then they tried to shoot him in the boat to kill him to get rid of the other witness.
[00:09:54.956 --> 00:09:56.217]  He's pled not guilty.
[00:09:56.217 --> 00:10:00.420]  His brother was on the CIA payroll on record and was a Patsy setup.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.761]  But that's a side issue.
[00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:03.462]  That anniversary is coming up here in April.
[00:10:03.462 --> 00:10:07.445]  We're going to send reporters up there to cover Police State 2, the Boston bombing too.
[00:10:07.445 --> 00:10:08.806]  In fact, I might go.
[00:10:08.806 --> 00:10:11.889]  I need to get out in the field more.
[00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:15.851]  Listeners, I really appreciate that and we always get good intel when I do that.
[00:10:15.851 --> 00:10:19.114]  But all of this is unfolding.
[00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:27.010]  And we got Paul Watson joining us in a few minutes to talk about Homeland Snipers Terrorize Confused Residents During Raid.
[00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.492]  And they did the same thing.
[00:10:28.492 --> 00:10:31.556]  Just came into an area, locked down a large area of a neighborhood.
[00:10:31.556 --> 00:10:36.904]  And then when people looked out their windows or were in their cars, they would yell at them and point guns at them.
[00:10:37.677 --> 00:10:39.338]  This is Fallujah, folks.
[00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:40.820]  We're insurgents.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.281]  The police train in major cities.
[00:10:42.281 --> 00:10:43.882]  That's in mainstream news.
[00:10:43.882 --> 00:10:46.284]  That the general public, quote, are insurgents.
[00:10:46.284 --> 00:10:47.606]  We are an enemy.
[00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:55.252]  They are the rise of the warrior police in their armored warwags from the Iraq War and from Afghanistan.
[00:10:55.252 --> 00:10:56.653]  And they're playing soldier, folks.
[00:10:56.653 --> 00:10:58.195]  They're preparing for the gun confiscation.
[00:10:58.962 --> 00:11:08.808]  It came out in Connecticut, a police officer blew the whistle that other police officers were saying they can't wait for the order to come for the gun confiscation, because all the semi-autos have basically been banned.
[00:11:08.808 --> 00:11:09.889]  They wouldn't let you register them.
[00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:15.853]  They passed a law to register them, but then didn't even create the facilities or personnel to let people even register them.
[00:11:15.853 --> 00:11:27.401]  So now they just say in letters, you can't register, turn your guns in, and the police are bragging even on message boards and their Facebook, I can't wait to kick down doors and, you know, go after these effing gun owners.
[00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:30.052]  And so a police officer spoke out against that.
[00:11:30.052 --> 00:11:31.592]  He's been put on leave.
[00:11:31.592 --> 00:11:33.313]  Mikael Thelen wrote two articles about that.
[00:11:33.313 --> 00:11:35.874]  It's been picked up by mainstream news in Connecticut now.
[00:11:35.874 --> 00:11:38.335]  I want to get that police officer on leave.
[00:11:38.335 --> 00:11:47.538]  Not the guy, not the guy that said that he was going to, you know, love kicking down doors.
[00:11:47.538 --> 00:11:49.219]  No, no, he's not on leave.
[00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:51.400]  The police officer that said, I don't like this.
[00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:58.796]  And then Mikkel Thelen and others were able to reach out to him and confirm who the police officer was.
[00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:06.021]  They should have free speech to say, man, I think it's crazy that the police are ready for war with the American people.
[00:12:06.021 --> 00:12:06.701]  By the way,
[00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:10.763]  It is not going to go the way you think, police.
[00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:14.124]  Or maybe police out there know it's not going to go the way some police think.
[00:12:14.124 --> 00:12:18.605]  You think you're going to have some crusade or jihad against gun owners and veterans?
[00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:22.906]  I mean, this is the globalists trying to get us all to kill each other and start a civil war.
[00:12:22.906 --> 00:12:23.966]  Just like they've done in Ukraine.
[00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:25.527]  That's basically what's going on.
[00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:28.307]  The pro-Russia, pro-EU side squared off.
[00:12:28.307 --> 00:12:29.508]  Country destabilized.
[00:12:29.508 --> 00:12:31.748]  Bankers coming in to loot the nation.
[00:12:31.748 --> 00:12:33.509]  They win out of the chaos.
[00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:34.149]  I don't want this.
[00:12:34.969 --> 00:12:40.254]  But I understand it's about a supremacy of power for the state to have the monopoly of gun ownership.
[00:12:40.254 --> 00:12:48.182]  And I understand a lot of police, especially the young ones, are on power trips and are very dictatorial and believe their word is law.
[00:12:48.182 --> 00:12:49.783]  Judge Dredd.
[00:12:49.783 --> 00:12:51.705]  Judge Jury Executioner.
[00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:54.508]  And our country is on a razor's edge.
[00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:57.791]  That story's up on DrudgeReport.com on the left-hand side.
[00:12:58.968 --> 00:13:06.612]  Under Rush Limbaugh hits number one on Amazon book sales for his first Patriots for kids.
[00:13:06.612 --> 00:13:16.358]  You know, I intend, I've said to write books for children about how exciting America is and how great the founders were and what a great legacy people have.
[00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:20.801]  And I actually was at Barnes & Noble's and I did actually buy my son
[00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:25.126]  This book, this weekend, and it's still in the back of my truck.
[00:13:25.126 --> 00:13:30.573]  I've been meaning to give it to him, but I forget to bring it in when I get home or go over to see him at night.
[00:13:30.573 --> 00:13:33.196]  But it's a good idea.
[00:13:33.196 --> 00:13:38.142]  That's the type of strategy the globalists are targeting the youth with lies and fraud and deceit.
[00:13:38.142 --> 00:13:39.724]  We need to target the youth with the truth.
[00:13:40.794 --> 00:13:45.298]  But anyways, the story is Homeland Snipers Terrorize Confused Residents During Raid.
[00:13:45.298 --> 00:13:49.982]  Another story that's from Infowars.com on drugs that ties into what we're about to get to right now.
[00:13:49.982 --> 00:13:55.646]  Facial recognition glasses to stop crime before it happens pre-crime.
[00:13:55.646 --> 00:14:04.313]  And we were out on the street yesterday with our reporters at the big media conference and film conference and music conference, South by Southwest, one of the biggest in the world.
[00:14:05.214 --> 00:14:14.339]  And we ran into a woman remote controlling a ground drone from another part of the United States with the ground drone on the street.
[00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:19.042]  So this is literally ground drones now hitting the street in Austin, Texas.
[00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:23.065]  It's going to be submarine drones, ship drones, ground drones, Google cars.
[00:14:23.065 --> 00:14:24.986]  This is the rise of the robots.
[00:14:24.986 --> 00:14:29.829]  And Leanne ran into people that were just flaunting giving up your rights is a great thing.
[00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:44.201]  Flaunting it's good to be face scanned to get a free sandwich with I guess the plastic additives to it from the folks over at Subway.
[00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:47.164]  Free tacos if you'll face scan or whatever from Taco Bell.
[00:14:47.164 --> 00:14:48.725]  The whole thing is an NSA
[00:14:49.983 --> 00:15:03.152]  Microsoft, Google, Police State, Rollout, and then they have the token Snowden there, and then we had interviews with most of the programmers that were there for the Snowden deal, not knowing, even after he spoke, who he was or about the NSA.
[00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:05.454]  I mean, these people do not know what planet they're on.
[00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:13.559]  So we're going to play Leanne McAdoo's latest report premiering in here on air, and then we're going to go to Paul Watson on the
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:24.873]  Boston Martial Law situation, where first they'd lock down a neighborhood, well first, you know, two houses, then a neighborhood, now a whole larger neighborhood than half a city, where you're the enemy.
[00:15:24.873 --> 00:15:28.717]  This is all Fallujah Lockdown, Cordon City Martial Law.
[00:15:28.717 --> 00:15:31.020]  That's against the law and the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.382]  Let's go to Leanne McAdoo's report.
[00:15:32.773 --> 00:15:41.259]  So here at South by Southwest at the Convention Center, a lot of companies have these interactive booths set up where people can interact with their products and play these new games.
[00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:46.062]  They've got a bunch of wearables with Google Glass and all sorts of virtual reality technology.
[00:15:46.062 --> 00:15:48.084]  Subway has a huge display back here.
[00:15:48.504 --> 00:16:02.433]  Where they've got clothes that are hooked up to computers, maybe with some sort of sensor material that will let you know when it's time to eat more of their yoga foam mat bread or, you know, putting that ham sandwich down because you're obese.
[00:16:02.433 --> 00:16:05.174]  Total nanny state new tracksuit.
[00:16:05.174 --> 00:16:05.355]  But...
[00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:27.172]  We asked if someone could just explain to us what these prototypes were for, and she went to go get her people, and they were all happy about it, but then they noticed that we were from Info Wars, and they refused to speak to the real press that's going to ask them, you know, hey, what's going on with this push for transhumanism, and is that why you're feeding us all these weird yoga foam materials?
[00:16:27.172 --> 00:16:30.535]  Because you're just preparing us for our new robo meals that we're gonna have?
[00:16:31.255 --> 00:16:43.240]  You know, they didn't want to answer those kind of questions, so they'll talk to the fake press that's going to kiss their butt and tell them how great their product is, but she saw this and she scurried away.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:50.523]  So this could be used for medicine, say where a surgeon is working and people want to see exactly how their
[00:16:51.644 --> 00:16:52.684]  Doing their process.
[00:16:52.684 --> 00:17:05.229]  So for example, one of the first use cases that were developed was for the military, where a battlefield medic could be triaging cases out on the field, and the expert surgeon could be in a forward operating base, and they could be, you know, helping and guiding.
[00:17:05.229 --> 00:17:08.870]  And now this technology, we're using it for the more commercial type use cases.
[00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:11.111]  Very minority report.
[00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:12.891]  It is very minority report, but you know what?
[00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:14.512]  Like, so are the smartphones, so is everything else.
[00:17:15.091 --> 00:17:17.733]  So what in the world is this?
[00:17:17.733 --> 00:17:20.516]  Yeah, so this is a remote presence device.
[00:17:20.516 --> 00:17:23.978]  It's a beam by a company called Suitable Technologies.
[00:17:23.978 --> 00:17:33.286]  And basically we created the device because we said, you know, why are people transporting their bodies places where they're not using their bodies for anything besides, you know, milling about a space?
[00:17:33.286 --> 00:17:35.828]  Wow, this is just incredible.
[00:17:35.828 --> 00:17:42.734]  So you, are you, do you feel kind of duped that you're having to sit at a desk and do South by remotely like this?
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:18:05.453]  No, so we've actually got a crazy week here, so I'm grateful that I can just go to South by Southwest remotely, because I feel like if I had to deal with a flight, and then, right, you're like, oh, I have to stay out late with everybody, I just feel like I can save my energy, and then I can also, I'm on my computer, right, so I can be working simultaneously, sending emails, and getting work done while I'm here.
[00:18:05.453 --> 00:18:06.134]  Wow.
[00:18:06.134 --> 00:18:10.557]  Alex Jones, you need to get this technology, then you can just send yourself where you need to go.
[00:18:10.557 --> 00:18:11.237]  Why?
[00:18:11.237 --> 00:18:12.458]  Why Google Glasses?
[00:18:13.285 --> 00:18:15.006]  Well, why not?
[00:18:15.006 --> 00:18:19.467]  We spend so much energy trying to use these phones in every which way we can.
[00:18:19.467 --> 00:18:21.008]  Why not just put a normal eye in them?
[00:18:21.008 --> 00:18:22.849]  You try to hear things with them.
[00:18:22.849 --> 00:18:25.710]  You try to use them to make yourself better.
[00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.671]  Because people are hopelessly innocent and naive.
[00:18:28.671 --> 00:18:35.133]  And if the information comes straight into your eyes, I imagine that would be valuable.
[00:18:35.133 --> 00:18:37.274]  Well, why not just implant a chip in your head next?
[00:18:37.998 --> 00:18:41.919]  Oh, because we're not at that point with Moore's Law yet.
[00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:43.079]  It's inevitable.
[00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:44.559]  It's going to happen.
[00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.900]  And you will.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.140]  When that happens, then you can be glasses-free.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.781]  Yeah, I imagine a lot of my friends who love the Google Glass, they love playing with the device.
[00:18:53.781 --> 00:18:55.782]  They just don't like how it looks right now.
[00:18:55.782 --> 00:18:57.182]  It's extremely intrusive.
[00:18:57.182 --> 00:18:59.122]  It's very conspicuous.
[00:18:59.122 --> 00:19:02.283]  And they're all waiting for Google to make contact lenses that do the same thing.
[00:19:02.283 --> 00:19:02.743]  Yeah.
[00:19:02.743 --> 00:19:04.463]  So we all think it's inevitable.
[00:19:04.463 --> 00:19:05.344]  Yeah.
[00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:06.864]  And all the pushback is futile.
[00:19:07.834 --> 00:19:15.843]  Has anyone yelled at you or tried to trip you or anything or something for putting their face in a facial recognition software with yours?
[00:19:15.843 --> 00:19:18.105]  No, Google doesn't allow that.
[00:19:18.105 --> 00:19:20.588]  It understands that this is very creepy and intrusive at the moment.
[00:19:20.588 --> 00:19:21.428]  That's not true.
[00:19:21.428 --> 00:19:23.771]  They already have an app doing that.
[00:19:23.771 --> 00:19:30.078]  So you can't submit apps to the store that would do facial recognition yet.
[00:19:30.738 --> 00:19:31.740]  Right.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:39.794]  And aren't you worried about someone hacking in and taking over, especially if you get that implant, chip implant?
[00:19:39.794 --> 00:19:39.914]  Si.
[00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:42.522]  We'll cross the bridge when we get there.
[00:19:42.522 --> 00:19:47.104]  Right now, the hardest challenge is to bring... Alright, we're gonna come back with the rest of this.
[00:19:47.104 --> 00:19:49.326]  It's like saying... This is simply intriguing.
[00:19:49.326 --> 00:19:49.946]  Did you hear him?
[00:19:49.946 --> 00:19:51.067]  We did.
[00:19:51.067 --> 00:19:53.648]  Add to that the Borg saying, you will be assimilated.
[00:19:53.648 --> 00:19:55.429]  Resistance is futile.
[00:19:55.429 --> 00:19:58.731]  That's who they give Google Glasses to, is these little minions that spew this.
[00:19:58.731 --> 00:19:59.971]  Resistance is futile.
[00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:00.632]  It's futile.
[00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:04.774]  The ultimate survival bug-out lightweight fishing pole is M-Rod.
[00:20:04.774 --> 00:20:08.276]  Made by a family-owned American company and assembled in Idaho,

[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.523]  M-Rod weighs just 8 ounces and breaks down to 14 inches.

[00:20:28.513 --> 00:20:29.674]  Survive to fish.

[00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.490]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.331]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[00:21:05.331 --> 00:21:10.172]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[00:21:10.172 --> 00:21:15.513]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.

[00:21:31.432 --> 00:21:36.234]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[00:21:36.234 --> 00:21:39.956]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[00:21:39.956 --> 00:21:42.317]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.

[00:22:07.373 --> 00:22:09.774]  How have you been feeling since your heart attack?
[00:22:09.774 --> 00:22:12.275]  Well, son, I am feeling a lot better.
[00:22:12.275 --> 00:22:17.077]  Ever since your sister ordered me a bottle of HeartDrop 2000's Xtendivite for my heart.
[00:22:17.077 --> 00:22:17.757]  HeartDrop?
[00:22:17.757 --> 00:22:18.637]  Xtendivite?
[00:22:18.637 --> 00:22:19.518]  What's that?
[00:22:19.518 --> 00:22:24.480]  Well, it's just seven herbs that are approved for helping keep my heart healthy.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.620]  That's great, Dad.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.101]  I was getting worried about you.
[00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:28.522]  I am so glad it's helping.
[00:22:28.522 --> 00:22:29.782]  So am I, son.
[00:22:29.782 --> 00:22:31.683]  I'm very glad your sister got it for me.
[00:22:32.285 --> 00:22:34.727]  I wish I had known about it before my heart attack.
[00:22:34.727 --> 00:22:37.048]  Yeah, but would you have taken it, though?
[00:22:37.048 --> 00:22:39.190]  You know, I'm not sure if I would have.
[00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.752]  But I'm awful glad I'm taking it now.
[00:22:41.752 --> 00:22:42.853]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[00:22:42.853 --> 00:22:43.213]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[00:22:59.335 --> 00:23:02.156]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:07.297]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:23:07.297 --> 00:23:15.398]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:15.398 --> 00:23:19.939]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:23:19.939 --> 00:23:23.740]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:29.842]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:29.842 --> 00:23:33.003]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:23:33.003 --> 00:23:38.385]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[00:23:38.385 --> 00:23:46.408]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-7000.
[00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:51.171]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:51.171 --> 00:23:53.133]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:32.699]  Rob Dew, Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, and other members of the InfoWars.com team, the InfoWars Nightly News and Radio team, are at the corner of San Jacinto and Congress, right down by the Capitol, where I kind of got the idea this weekend that we needed an armed march.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.402]  with the Texas Open Carry folks during South by Southwest.
[00:24:37.402 --> 00:24:55.472]  When we called them, they said, no, we're already doing one Saturday now to counter Bloomberg and others coming down here, basically getting the World Bank to finance South by Southwest to try to organize media groups for the registration and confiscation of guns, which is the Mayors Against the Constitution's goal.
[00:24:55.472 --> 00:24:58.693]  The official name is Mayors, of course,
[00:25:00.134 --> 00:25:02.116]  against illegal guns.
[00:25:02.116 --> 00:25:06.079]  Of course, that's any gun that the state doesn't own or have deployed at the American people.
[00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:12.105]  As Mao Tse-Tung said, political power goes out of the barrel of a gun, or all political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
[00:25:12.105 --> 00:25:16.529]  But they're going to be marching, folks, and I think it's going to be as many as 30, 40, 50 people on prompt to.
[00:25:16.529 --> 00:25:18.390]  We're not sure.
[00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.892]  But I said, hey, let's have one earlier.
[00:25:19.892 --> 00:25:26.697]  Let's have one on Wednesday, if you want to do it, to try to supercharge national media attention for Saturday.
[00:25:28.158 --> 00:25:29.459]  And the march they have this Saturday.
[00:25:29.459 --> 00:25:31.100]  It's all listed at Infowars.com.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.001]  I'm going to have Kit Daniels repost that.
[00:25:33.001 --> 00:25:44.666]  But finishing the end of Leanne McAdoo's report that we're going to post up on Infowars.com, if folks want to be able to link through to that, we'll probably add it to Watson's article about the Google Glasses because it ties into that and it's linked on Drudge.
[00:25:45.666 --> 00:26:09.351]  Right now, but this guy, they got, what, 3,000 people together at first, brought them into the Google events, got them to agree that they would push a party line about, you will be assimilated, you will submit, it's inevitable, you will take brain chips, but, you know, first it will be contacts and then it will be in the brain, this is good, this is happy, this is trendy, this is fun, this will empower you.
[00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:12.191]  The problem is, it's already hacked by the globalists.
[00:26:12.191 --> 00:26:14.452]  It's controlled by the eugenicist technocrats.
[00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:18.223]  Sure, I'm sure down the road brain chips are great for blind people.
[00:26:18.223 --> 00:26:20.805]  Brain chips could boost space travelers, whatever.
[00:26:20.805 --> 00:26:25.789]  The problem is, the system is run by evil people inherently.
[00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:28.751]  Look at the NSA, look at all of it.
[00:26:28.751 --> 00:26:31.714]  Look at how they lie constantly, look at how they cheat constantly.
[00:26:31.714 --> 00:26:34.276]  You're letting them hack into your life like the smart meters.
[00:26:35.626 --> 00:26:44.937]  So let's let this idiot finish because I've heard what he's saying before and so Google literally is like an invading space armada.
[00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:46.098]  Here it is.
[00:26:46.098 --> 00:26:50.243]  So we all think it's inevitable and all the pushback is futile.
[00:26:51.173 --> 00:26:59.380]  Has anyone yelled at you or tried to trip you or anything or something for putting their face in a facial recognition software with yours?
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.442]  No, Google doesn't allow that.
[00:27:01.442 --> 00:27:04.104]  It understands that this is very creepy and intrusive at the moment.
[00:27:04.104 --> 00:27:07.107]  People are really on the fence with this kind of thing.
[00:27:07.107 --> 00:27:12.231]  So you can't submit apps to the store that would do facial recognition.
[00:27:13.232 --> 00:27:14.092]  Yet.
[00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:15.093]  Right.
[00:27:15.093 --> 00:27:23.135]  And aren't you worried about someone hacking in and taking over, especially if you get that implant, chip implant?
[00:27:23.135 --> 00:27:25.876]  See, we'll cross the bridge when we get there.
[00:27:25.876 --> 00:27:30.457]  Right now, the hardest challenge is to bring hardware to that level.
[00:27:30.457 --> 00:27:34.239]  It's like saying, it's like saying that, oh, we've just discovered fire.
[00:27:34.239 --> 00:27:38.020]  We could maybe melt stones and make iron out of it.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.301]  But wait, somebody could make a knife with that and kill me.
[00:27:40.301 --> 00:27:41.001]  So let's not
[00:27:41.801 --> 00:27:43.582]  Let's not use fire.
[00:27:43.582 --> 00:27:44.922]  That's ridiculous.
[00:27:44.922 --> 00:27:45.822]  These are just tools.
[00:27:45.822 --> 00:27:51.484]  You can either make the best steak in the world using the sharpest knife or you could become a homicidal maniac.
[00:27:51.484 --> 00:27:57.907]  It really depends on you and it depends on us as a society to produce people that will use this for making everything better.
[00:27:57.907 --> 00:28:03.388]  And they've got all these nice people that work at Google like this guy and who really believe this stuff.
[00:28:03.388 --> 00:28:03.949]  It's a cult.
[00:28:03.949 --> 00:28:04.609]  It's the new religion.
[00:28:05.806 --> 00:28:17.330]  And the globalists, all the technocrats, from Ray Kurzweil to you name it, say you will take brain chips, we will reduce population by at least 80%, world government will be here by 2020, we will micromanage you in a technocracy.
[00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:22.953]  I mean, I've read hundreds of books and news articles and white papers where they all say this.
[00:28:22.953 --> 00:28:25.714]  I mean, we've read it on air, you know it, you see it in the news.
[00:28:25.714 --> 00:28:27.154]  And then we go, hey, we don't want that.
[00:28:27.154 --> 00:28:29.435]  And they go, hey, don't be scared.
[00:28:29.435 --> 00:28:30.455]  It's going to be fun.
[00:28:30.455 --> 00:28:31.596]  Resistance is futile.
[00:28:32.318 --> 00:28:36.841]  He actually said, resistance is futile.
[00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:38.142]  Well, I've heard that before.
[00:28:38.142 --> 00:28:40.324]  We are the Borg.
[00:28:40.324 --> 00:28:43.006]  Lower your shields and surrender your ships.
[00:28:43.006 --> 00:28:48.029]  We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own.
[00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:51.232]  Your culture will adapt to service us.
[00:28:51.232 --> 00:28:54.414]  Resistance is futile.
[00:28:54.414 --> 00:28:57.196]  Resistance is futile.
[00:28:57.196 --> 00:28:58.797]  No, resistance is victory.
[00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.291]  And that's why they always tell you resistance is futile.
[00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:05.252]  Because it's not.
[00:29:05.252 --> 00:29:06.213]  Freedom is sexy.
[00:29:06.213 --> 00:29:07.193]  Freedom is cool.
[00:29:07.193 --> 00:29:08.874]  Freedom is deep.
[00:29:08.874 --> 00:29:10.115]  And free will is key.
[00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:13.577]  And the technocracy is being built to smash free will.
[00:29:13.577 --> 00:29:15.978]  And look at the fruits of television and the smartphones.
[00:29:15.978 --> 00:29:17.759]  The language is shrinking.
[00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:22.262]  The biological brainwaves are lowering.
[00:29:22.262 --> 00:29:23.802]  The IQ is dropping.
[00:29:23.802 --> 00:29:27.324]  We are physically dying.
[00:29:27.324 --> 00:29:29.306]  We are physically being wrecked right now.
[00:29:30.259 --> 00:29:34.561]  So let me tell you, Google, and New World Order, what comes out the other end of your machine.
[00:29:34.561 --> 00:29:36.762]  Stinking disease.
[00:29:36.762 --> 00:29:38.923]  Fountains of pus.
[00:29:38.923 --> 00:29:39.343]  Okay?
[00:29:39.343 --> 00:29:40.884]  We don't want what you're doing.
[00:29:40.884 --> 00:29:42.224]  We will hack your system.
[00:29:42.224 --> 00:29:43.145]  We will take it over.
[00:29:43.145 --> 00:29:44.305]  We will use it.
[00:29:44.305 --> 00:29:46.886]  We will assimilate you for humanity!
[00:29:46.886 --> 00:29:49.808]  And you will not stop this degenerate self!
[00:29:49.808 --> 00:29:51.208]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.208 --> 00:29:53.730]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.411]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.464 --> 00:30:05.186]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:30:05.186 --> 00:30:08.308]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:30:08.308 --> 00:30:13.870]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.811]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:30:15.811 --> 00:30:17.432]  We are what we eat.
[00:30:17.432 --> 00:30:22.114]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:30:22.114 --> 00:30:26.336]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:30:26.336 --> 00:30:28.597]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:30:28.877 --> 00:30:35.119]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.933]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:31:05.933 --> 00:31:10.457]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:31:10.457 --> 00:31:16.582]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:31:16.582 --> 00:31:27.352]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:34.058]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:48.791]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:31:49.011 --> 00:32:03.201]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:32:03.201 --> 00:32:08.204]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:32:08.204 --> 00:32:15.389]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:21.154]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:32:21.154 --> 00:32:25.178]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:32:25.178 --> 00:32:29.902]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:32:29.902 --> 00:32:35.127]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:32:35.367 --> 00:32:38.609]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:32:38.609 --> 00:32:41.111]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:32:41.111 --> 00:32:45.874]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:32:45.874 --> 00:32:48.756]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:32:48.756 --> 00:32:55.960]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.241]  We're getting prepared.
[00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:57.902]  Are you?
[00:32:57.902 --> 00:32:59.002]  Infowarshop.com
[00:33:10.003 --> 00:33:14.884]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:14.884 --> 00:33:18.885]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.885 --> 00:33:27.068]  The globalists have told us that the age of man is over.
[00:33:27.068 --> 00:33:34.690]  The age of the technocracy with the elite becoming super-empowered super-beings merged with machines is here.
[00:33:35.578 --> 00:33:42.322]  And that we should just kneel to their overwrite, because resistance is futile.
[00:33:42.322 --> 00:33:55.229]  And they're training us to live under soft martial law with total surveillance, checkpoints, police locking down whole areas of cities, to do a SWAT raid on one house, aiming guns at people in their cars, people in their windows.
[00:33:55.229 --> 00:33:57.030]  That's what we're about to talk about with Paul Watson.
[00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.991]  And then, 21st century Paul Reveres.
[00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:03.033]  And we have a live video feed of that, we might be able to pop up here in a minute.
[00:34:04.227 --> 00:34:12.075]  21st century Paul Reveres are massing at the corner of San Jacinto and Congress.
[00:34:12.075 --> 00:34:22.586]  Maybe you can get the guys to a pan, because I saw a big shot earlier of folks with the guns out there, and are getting ready to march to show that the Second Amendment is not dead.
[00:34:23.675 --> 00:34:32.865]  And are getting ready to basically show the world by exercising our rights openly that we are not slaves of the establishment.
[00:34:32.865 --> 00:34:40.093]  So you've still got time if you want to open carry, which is totally legal and lawful, to get to the corner of San Jacinto and Congress
[00:34:41.174 --> 00:34:51.641]  And to march down towards the South by Southwest trendies with their Google glasses and drones and taser drones that are all being rolled out to condition them that resistance is futile.
[00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:56.163]  You go down and join Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, and the rest of the crew.
[00:34:56.163 --> 00:34:58.405]  Kit Daniels is there reporting.
[00:34:59.205 --> 00:35:03.448]  Uh, and we've got, uh, again, Jakari Jackson down there interviewing people for the Nightly News right now.
[00:35:03.448 --> 00:35:13.094]  We'll have live update feed with them in about 10 minutes, and then we're going to march with them, uh, in the next hour covering Second Amendment issues for the first half hour until...
[00:35:14.363 --> 00:35:23.388]  Kathleen Willey, a rape victim, an assault victim of Lord Clinton, will be joining us with her book out by WorldNetDaily.
[00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:25.830]  We've rescheduled that several times, but that is happening today.
[00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:27.011]  Cross our fingers.
[00:35:27.011 --> 00:35:27.791]  Hope to die.
[00:35:27.791 --> 00:35:29.712]  Stick a needle in our eye.
[00:35:29.712 --> 00:35:39.878]  But we're going to go to Paul Watson here first about one of the double links we've got up on DrudgeReport.com, via PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:35:39.878 --> 00:35:43.461]  Homeland snipers terrorize confused residents during raid.
[00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:45.761]  And this is the new thing.
[00:35:45.761 --> 00:35:48.942]  It used to be a backfire by a school.
[00:35:48.942 --> 00:35:54.903]  The police would lock down all the streets around it and point guns at people all over the country, including here in Austin.
[00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:57.144]  Now it's locked down the whole neighborhood.
[00:35:57.144 --> 00:36:04.946]  Or now, if they're doing a SWAT raid, it's take over the neighbor's house to have a quote, tactical advantage and arrest you if you don't give your house to them without a warrant.
[00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:06.206]  That's quartering troops in your house.
[00:36:07.506 --> 00:36:11.789]  And then now it's locked down the whole neighborhood, and now it's locked down the whole city, and now everyone's a suspect.
[00:36:11.789 --> 00:36:12.870]  Everyone's a terrorist.
[00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.132]  Oh, we're looking for a black guy who's shooting cops in LA.
[00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:22.416]  Here, let's shoot up vehicles full of white women that don't even match the vehicle.
[00:36:22.416 --> 00:36:25.998]  Well, that's okay, because, you know, they might be terrorists, too.
[00:36:25.998 --> 00:36:28.540]  This is just part of the craziness.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.881]  We're looking for a white male.
[00:36:30.802 --> 00:36:33.263]  Let's shoot up a vehicle full of black people.
[00:36:33.263 --> 00:36:34.844]  Remember that happened in a case too.
[00:36:34.844 --> 00:36:36.084]  It's just, just randomly.
[00:36:36.084 --> 00:36:36.965]  Oh, we're looking for a white guy.
[00:36:36.965 --> 00:36:37.705]  There's some black people.
[00:36:37.705 --> 00:36:38.125]  Open fire.
[00:36:38.125 --> 00:36:40.526]  Oh, we're looking for a black guy.
[00:36:40.526 --> 00:36:41.407]  Big black guy.
[00:36:41.407 --> 00:36:42.547]  Cop.
[00:36:42.547 --> 00:36:43.087]  Uh, Dorner.
[00:36:43.087 --> 00:36:44.128]  Let's just shoot some women.
[00:36:44.128 --> 00:36:47.269]  And they shot three carloads of people.
[00:36:47.269 --> 00:36:48.950]  Just totally insane in broad daylight.
[00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:52.351]  Just, just randomly opening fire, running around scared to death.
[00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:57.554]  Statistically, cops had a better chance of being killed by a bolt of lightning than Dorner during that whole thing.
[00:36:57.554 --> 00:36:57.914]  Look it up.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.560]  But they don't care.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.481]  Just like hundreds die a year in gas man explosions.
[00:37:04.481 --> 00:37:06.622]  That's clearly what happened in Harlem.
[00:37:06.622 --> 00:37:09.963]  Preliminary evidence is overwhelming.
[00:37:09.963 --> 00:37:11.243]  They're trying to say it's 9-11, folks.
[00:37:11.243 --> 00:37:14.284]  They're invoking every form of fear except for what's really dangerous.
[00:37:14.284 --> 00:37:17.225]  Great White Sharks kill 5 people a year on average.
[00:37:17.225 --> 00:37:17.685]  Records 12 people.
[00:37:19.887 --> 00:37:27.290]  Everyone I know, most people will not go into the ocean and are constantly scared because they think great whites are about to eat them.
[00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.630]  And I know I beat that to death.
[00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:32.972]  That didn't happen until Jaws came out in 1970, whatever it was.
[00:37:32.972 --> 00:37:36.873]  And then the resorts had to put ads out saying there aren't sharks, they won't eat you.
[00:37:39.164 --> 00:37:41.646]  Because people are so scared, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:41.646 --> 00:37:43.908]  I keep hammering this because it's mind control.
[00:37:43.908 --> 00:37:49.574]  Now joining us to show how we're going under martial law, not just here but in England, they do the same thing now.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.783]  Is Paul Watson to break down this incredible story?
[00:37:53.783 --> 00:37:57.406]  There's photos and videos up on Infowars.com of this.
[00:37:57.406 --> 00:37:59.168]  The story was up last night.
[00:37:59.168 --> 00:38:00.529]  It's already scrolled off the front page.
[00:38:00.529 --> 00:38:02.211]  It should be re-added to the front page.
[00:38:02.211 --> 00:38:05.894]  The best place to find it is the left-hand side of DrudgeReport.com.
[00:38:05.894 --> 00:38:12.120]  But let's go to Paul Watson now from Albion, from London.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.682]  Paul, break down what's happening here.
[00:38:15.037 --> 00:38:21.861]  Well, this was a combined federal NYPD drugs bust in East Williamsburg in the early hours of Sunday morning.
[00:38:21.861 --> 00:38:24.963]  Basically started with a low-flying helicopter.
[00:38:24.963 --> 00:38:27.945]  They proceeded to block off some of the streets.
[00:38:27.945 --> 00:38:41.114]  And then the DHS goons descended with their flashlight snipers and pointed them at people who were in different buildings, not even involved, not even in the same building as where the drugs bust was taking place.
[00:38:41.114 --> 00:38:44.356]  So, some of the quotes from the residents who were there were
[00:38:44.896 --> 00:38:59.729]  Utterly confused and frankly terrorized during the incident because they would have DHS goons with snipers point them up at them as they looked out of the window and train the gun on their faces even though they were in a completely different building.
[00:38:59.729 --> 00:39:05.414]  So again it's another one of these concerns about the militarization of domestic law enforcement.
[00:39:05.414 --> 00:39:08.937]  You remember back in August we did the report out of New Hampshire
[00:39:09.477 --> 00:39:16.561]  Where they were trying to purchase this Bearcat armoured vehicle, and a similar vehicle was used in the incident on Sunday.
[00:39:16.561 --> 00:39:28.327]  And the police chief there, John Duval, actually said that they needed this armoured vehicle to use against groups such as Sovereign Citizens, Free Staters and Occupy New Hampshire.
[00:39:28.327 --> 00:39:38.812]  So even the police chief admitted that it's not for criminals, it's not for terrorists, it's for political extremists, basically anyone who protests against the government.
[00:39:40.506 --> 00:39:55.280]  That's right, and we have video compilations, Paul, of the thousands of armed police in camo, in black uniforms, in armored vehicles, literally running around where a woman walks out, and they grab her and shove her down the porch.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.742]  They're pointing guns at everybody in their houses.
[00:39:57.742 --> 00:40:01.765]  This is occupied America, and the religion is, quote, police safety.
[00:40:02.446 --> 00:40:05.270]  And so all of us, basically, are the enemy.
[00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:11.959]  And this has been a conversion, by design, part of the quote, North American Rand Corporation Stabilization Force.
[00:40:11.959 --> 00:40:17.206]  The National Stabilization Force is the martial law rollout plan, incrementally.
[00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:25.949]  That's right, and it started back really in 1997, which is around the same time your first Police Day documentary came out.
[00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:35.297]  Because that's when the Defence Department started paying out for this equipment, this military equipment, to be distributed to law enforcement agencies.
[00:40:35.297 --> 00:40:35.838]  So they spent...
[00:40:36.998 --> 00:40:57.626]  4.2 billion dollars on that since 97 but then since the inception of Homeland Security a separate payment of 34 billion dollars in terrorism grants has gone to local police departments and that's why now they dress like military assets basically and treat us as the terrorists because they're not fighting a war
[00:40:58.146 --> 00:41:13.855]  Crime has gone down, but they have to arm up, because now they're being trained that we're the threat, we're the extremists, we're the potential terrorists, so that's why they're starting to look like military assets, because they're being told that the war is now domestic, that the United States is the battlefield.
[00:41:13.855 --> 00:41:24.941]  And just like them denying the NSA's spying on everybody for the last 20 years, when it was already all public, basically, the big news was, is just they were lying about it the whole time, but they were lying about what was already public.
[00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:28.429]  And they would just go, nobody's doing that, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:41:28.429 --> 00:41:32.693]  And they're like, no one's trained to take your guns, no one's training for martial law.
[00:41:32.693 --> 00:41:37.358]  When the army manuals, the police manuals, there's literally hundreds of them.
[00:41:37.358 --> 00:41:43.143]  The FBI came out in January of 2014, this year, and said, our new mission is no longer crime.
[00:41:43.143 --> 00:41:45.105]  It is extremism.
[00:41:45.105 --> 00:41:48.369]  It is political policing commissariat.
[00:41:48.369 --> 00:41:49.310]  I mean, this is it.
[00:41:50.482 --> 00:41:51.802]  And there's no doubting it.
[00:41:51.802 --> 00:41:56.203]  I'm not even trying to demonize the average FBI person or the average cop.
[00:41:56.203 --> 00:42:03.125]  One reason they haven't been able to have total tyranny take over yet is because there's still some basic common sense there, but they're getting rid of it.
[00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:16.648]  I mean, we see a bank robbery in California and they, for 20 square miles, randomly have cops standing out aiming guns at people in their cars, walking up with M16s to people's heads that don't even match the description.
[00:42:17.128 --> 00:42:19.390]  And then the next car comes up and they aim guns at their head.
[00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:23.914]  I mean, I'm gonna get mad when I pull up and the cops are aiming guns at everybody's head.
[00:42:23.914 --> 00:42:40.428]  Now, if I was driving down the road and they said, red Chevy pickup truck, white male driving, just shot and killed, you know, two people in a front lawn, armed and dangerous, and I heard that on the radio, and then I drove up to a checkpoint, and they weren't aiming guns at anybody, but then I was driving a red pickup, and they aimed guns at me, I'd put my hands up and get out.
[00:42:41.169 --> 00:42:43.930]  But I pull up to a check, because that's probable cause.
[00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.830]  You've got some evidence there.
[00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:46.831]  You know what you're looking for.
[00:42:46.831 --> 00:42:52.112]  I pull up to one of these checkpoints, where they're aiming guns at people's heads, I'm gonna get mad, man!
[00:42:52.112 --> 00:42:54.673]  Every car, you put a gun to their head?
[00:42:54.673 --> 00:42:57.994]  This is pure martial law Fallujah crap!
[00:42:57.994 --> 00:43:00.115]  And, I'm sorry Paul, go ahead, final comments.
[00:43:01.294 --> 00:43:07.337]  Well, I mean, that's exactly what the former Colonel Peter Martino said in New Hampshire during his public testimony.
[00:43:07.337 --> 00:43:08.257]  Marine Corps Colonel.
[00:43:08.257 --> 00:43:09.017]  He was in Iraq.
[00:43:09.017 --> 00:43:10.018]  He was in Fallujah.
[00:43:10.018 --> 00:43:12.379]  He was in 10 tours of combat, different tours, yes.
[00:43:13.487 --> 00:43:18.610]  Exactly, and he said, you know, he trained the Iraqi Army, he was in Fallujah, he said this is exactly what's happening.
[00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:20.671]  They're building a domestic army.
[00:43:20.671 --> 00:43:22.332]  He was a colonel in Iraq.
[00:43:22.332 --> 00:43:26.935]  This is not us saying it, this is decorated professionals saying it.
[00:43:26.935 --> 00:43:35.760]  So, they're also building towns in Virginia, as we saw a few weeks ago, with Christian churches, you know, American signs, fully operational subways.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.781]  They're preparing for the occupation.
[00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:42.524]  Whether it actually happens or not remains to be seen, but there's no doubt that that's what they're gearing up for.
[00:43:43.479 --> 00:43:45.061]  Paul, what was the headline on your article?
[00:43:45.061 --> 00:43:45.601]  There it is.
[00:43:45.601 --> 00:43:45.982]  U.S.
[00:43:45.982 --> 00:43:49.786]  Army builds fake city in Virginia to practice military occupation.
[00:43:49.786 --> 00:43:56.573]  And the London Telegraph spun it saying, oh, or it was the Daily Mail, oh, it's a mosque.
[00:43:56.573 --> 00:43:58.395]  It's a Baptist church, folks.
[00:43:58.395 --> 00:44:01.058]  And they literally train to gun confiscate.
[00:44:01.058 --> 00:44:02.760]  And it's on record they're training for it.
[00:44:04.707 --> 00:44:06.610]  Well, actually, there were both.
[00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:10.775]  There was a mosque and a Christian church, so they basically want to occupy everyone.
[00:44:10.775 --> 00:44:19.607]  But all the signs were in English, you know, they had subways with the Washington decals on them, so it was very much designed to be a domestic American city.
[00:44:19.607 --> 00:44:22.491]  It wasn't set up as a Middle Eastern city.
[00:44:22.711 --> 00:44:23.111]  Sure, sure.
[00:44:23.111 --> 00:44:27.693]  I mean, Northcom has all announced this, Brigade Homeland, Army Time, Stars and Stripes.
[00:44:27.693 --> 00:44:28.913]  It's all public.
[00:44:28.913 --> 00:44:40.917]  But they keep telling the general public and mainstream media it doesn't exist because they don't want to have a debate about the illegal federalization, militarization via Northcom.
[00:44:41.957 --> 00:44:45.439]  That's like they don't want people knowing drones are watching farmers, even though it's public.
[00:44:45.439 --> 00:44:53.545]  They don't want to have a debate about 2.6 billion bullets and targets of the average American and training to confiscate guns from veterans and retired police.
[00:44:53.545 --> 00:44:59.489]  Even though that's all public, they can't have a debate about it, because if they allow us to have a debate, if they admit it's all going on...
[00:45:00.396 --> 00:45:02.637]  Then we will morally win the day.
[00:45:02.637 --> 00:45:04.899]  So they just want to deny all this is happening.
[00:45:04.899 --> 00:45:09.381]  Kind of like they want to deny Obamacare is written by offshore banks to double your premiums.
[00:45:09.381 --> 00:45:11.382]  Or there's death panels, even though they're in the bill.
[00:45:11.382 --> 00:45:16.905]  Or that the IRS hired 17,000 agents to take $5,000 out of your bank account.
[00:45:16.905 --> 00:45:18.166]  I mean, that's in the bill.
[00:45:18.166 --> 00:45:20.027]  So of course it's beginning.
[00:45:20.027 --> 00:45:22.308]  Because that's what the bill says.
[00:45:22.308 --> 00:45:26.331]  But they count on people not going and reading the stinking bill, and then they have
[00:45:27.111 --> 00:45:34.058]  Those traitors on MSNBC go, Alex Jones is a racist, he lies and says the IRS is going to take money out of your account.
[00:45:34.058 --> 00:45:36.060]  Listen, you witch!
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.423]  Matt Al, you know full well it's in that stinking bill!
[00:45:39.423 --> 00:45:41.025]  I'm sorry Paul, go ahead, final comment.
[00:45:42.045 --> 00:45:46.008]  Well, it's interesting how the media controls it, because individually they're dying.
[00:45:46.008 --> 00:45:49.071]  You know, CNN losing half their viewership over the past year.
[00:45:49.071 --> 00:45:55.957]  But in concert, which they always work in concert to create national talking points, that's how they frame conversations.
[00:45:55.957 --> 00:46:00.601]  That's how they prevent anything important from becoming a national conversation.
[00:46:00.601 --> 00:46:01.842]  So they've still got that power.
[00:46:02.242 --> 00:46:05.825]  When they work together, which they fundamentally routinely do.
[00:46:05.825 --> 00:46:12.651]  So, the fact that we're growing so much allows us to create these national conversations to a greater and greater degree.
[00:46:12.651 --> 00:46:14.292]  And this is one that needs to happen.
[00:46:14.292 --> 00:46:18.376]  That is our greatest power and I thank God for it and all of our friends in the real media for it.
[00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:20.737]  Yeah, that's the great responsibility.
[00:46:20.737 --> 00:46:21.898]  It's the opposite of a power trip.
[00:46:21.898 --> 00:46:37.230]  It is a great responsibility that InfoWars.com and PrisonBlinded.com and our reporters and you, Paul Watson, and the great team are able every week now to spur huge national conversations and legislation, which MSNBC and the White House bemoan.
[00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:42.094]  They track us as the source of so much resistance because we see who you are, enemy.
[00:46:42.754 --> 00:46:43.835]  I mean, you're naked!
[00:46:43.835 --> 00:46:47.298]  We're like a three-year-old saying the Emperor is not wearing any clothes.
[00:46:47.298 --> 00:46:48.859]  It's over, scum!
[00:46:48.859 --> 00:46:52.802]  And you can't take out Infowars, because if you did, it would make us martyrs.
[00:46:52.802 --> 00:46:54.023]  It's already spread.
[00:46:54.023 --> 00:46:56.005]  People already know you're the enemy.
[00:46:56.005 --> 00:47:05.633]  They already know you're outsider, outlander, usurper, globalist, outlanders, New World Order traitors, in here to try to take over our country.
[00:47:05.633 --> 00:47:08.095]  And it is not going to work.
[00:47:08.835 --> 00:47:10.416]  You are going to fall.
[00:47:10.416 --> 00:47:11.737]  You are being identified.
[00:47:11.737 --> 00:47:14.319]  You will fail.
[00:47:14.319 --> 00:47:16.640]  In the old times, we were fighting Stalin or Hitler.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.021]  Open enemies you could see.
[00:47:18.021 --> 00:47:20.122]  This is a corporate takeover.
[00:47:20.122 --> 00:47:21.443]  We can now see it.
[00:47:21.443 --> 00:47:26.366]  We can see it's an outside occupation, a corporate global takeover, in their own words, and we're countering it.
[00:47:26.366 --> 00:47:28.428]  Great job, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:47:29.226 --> 00:47:29.586]  Thanks Alex.
[00:47:52.057 --> 00:47:56.722]  And again, these are the modern-day Paul Reveres, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:56.722 --> 00:48:10.356]  The modern-day Paul Reveres are down there to march openly with their firearms to show everyone that citizens have a right to have guns, not just the God state, not just the centralized system.
[00:48:10.356 --> 00:48:12.138]  Are our reporters ready for us to go to them?
[00:48:13.797 --> 00:48:14.597]  Absolutely.
[00:48:14.597 --> 00:48:17.178]  I'm getting an in and out of the audio feed.
[00:48:17.178 --> 00:48:19.139]  Okay, Leanne, you're on the air.
[00:48:19.139 --> 00:48:21.580]  I like your t-shirt.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:28.843]  Hey, I've been told it's actually quite blinding out here with this golden foil, but... You are a Valkyrie of self-defense.
[00:48:28.843 --> 00:48:29.884]  Yes.
[00:48:29.884 --> 00:48:32.565]  Wonder Woman's got her golden lassos of truth.
[00:48:32.565 --> 00:48:35.626]  I have got my golden guns of liberty.
[00:48:35.626 --> 00:48:38.687]  So, come and take it.
[00:48:38.687 --> 00:48:41.108]  Freedom is sexy, you know what I mean?
[00:48:41.108 --> 00:48:42.109]  It sure is, Leanne.
[00:48:43.331 --> 00:48:46.072]  So we've got a really nice sized crowd already.
[00:48:46.072 --> 00:48:48.132]  We said about what, 20 minutes until noon.
[00:48:48.132 --> 00:48:52.673]  We're out here standing right about in front of the Capitol at 12th and San Jacinto.
[00:48:52.673 --> 00:48:56.454]  There's plenty of parking in the Capitol parking garage.
[00:48:56.454 --> 00:48:59.935]  So we've got probably about 50 people out here already.
[00:48:59.935 --> 00:49:02.175]  And I'm standing here with Justin Delosh.
[00:49:02.175 --> 00:49:05.376]  He is one of the organizers for Come and Take It Austin.
[00:49:05.376 --> 00:49:09.237]  So what are some of the safety precautions that you're going to be letting everyone know about before we get started?
[00:49:09.677 --> 00:49:19.402]  Before we get started, we'll huddle everybody up and we do like a buddy system chamber check where you basically, the person to your left of you and the person to the right of you, we each check our chamber to make sure none of us are carrying chambered.
[00:49:19.402 --> 00:49:22.964]  Magazines loaded or empty, it's a preference, but we do not carry chambered.
[00:49:22.964 --> 00:49:28.026]  And we also make sure that everybody's carrying their muzzle and buttstock as close to 6 and 12 o'clock as possible.
[00:49:29.011 --> 00:49:30.831]  So we've had a lot of press out here.
[00:49:30.831 --> 00:49:34.612]  We've already got a visit from the Capitol Police and they were very nice actually.
[00:49:34.612 --> 00:49:43.554]  They said that they support what we're doing out here and they're just gonna basically escort us through South by Southwest since we do have a mixed crowd out there.
[00:49:43.554 --> 00:49:48.475]  People are drinking during the daytime so you just never know how they're gonna get wild.
[00:49:48.475 --> 00:49:51.156]  But what is your aim here with the public today?
[00:49:52.016 --> 00:50:02.826]  Our goal is to educate people on the gun laws here in Texas and to educate people to let them know that we're actually behind in gun laws whereas the rumors are Texas is a gun-friendly state and we're actually one of only six states in the U.S.
[00:50:02.826 --> 00:50:05.388]  that does not have any form of open carry for handguns.
[00:50:05.388 --> 00:50:09.712]  So we'd like to see a constitutional carry or at least open carry passed here in Texas.
[00:50:10.435 --> 00:50:12.616]  Exactly, and it seems like we've got a lot of support for that.
[00:50:12.616 --> 00:50:15.537]  A lot of people going by honking and everything.
[00:50:15.537 --> 00:50:23.440]  Also too, it's sort of a way to let people, kind of re-educate people and wake them up from the massive brainwashing that's been going on with guns.
[00:50:24.202 --> 00:50:24.702]  Exactly.
[00:50:24.702 --> 00:50:27.803]  We actively seek people to have this kind of dialogue about the firearm laws.
[00:50:27.803 --> 00:50:28.324]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:50:28.324 --> 00:50:36.126]  Because those people that may be on the fence, we actively go out there to address some of the issues they may have regarding firearms or maybe lack of knowledge.
[00:50:36.126 --> 00:50:40.548]  We actually actively go out there and engage in this kind of dialogue with them to help educate.
[00:50:40.548 --> 00:50:45.510]  Leanne, get them to plug the different gun groups' websites for folks that want to get involved.
[00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:49.271]  Can you plug a few of the different gun groups' websites for anyone that wants to get involved?
[00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:51.680]  Yeah, we're with Come and Take It Austin.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.301]  We have a Facebook page, Come and Take It Austin.
[00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:56.342]  We have 30 chapters across Texas.
[00:50:56.342 --> 00:50:58.943]  So we're actually part of a bigger group called Come and Take It Texas.
[00:50:58.943 --> 00:51:02.324]  So if anybody goes Facebook, Come and Take It Texas, they can find their chapter there.
[00:51:02.324 --> 00:51:05.005]  And we're doing rallies and walks every month.
[00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:08.611]  We're going to be talking to him more as we march.
[00:51:08.611 --> 00:51:13.955]  Leanne, I see the owner of Central Texas Gun Works behind you and a reporter, Kit Daniels, for Info Wars.
[00:51:13.955 --> 00:51:15.797]  Let's talk to some of those guys.
[00:51:15.797 --> 00:51:20.400]  And while you're talking to them, we can pan around and show the crowd and some of the firearms that are there.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.423]  Hey, how are you doing?
[00:51:23.423 --> 00:51:24.464]  I'm blocking the sun here.
[00:51:24.464 --> 00:51:25.304]  Mike Cargill.
[00:51:33.015 --> 00:51:35.417]  Yeah, get Mike Cargill's take on this.
[00:51:35.417 --> 00:51:37.659]  So what's your take on this event here today?
[00:51:37.659 --> 00:51:39.781]  Ah, it's about freedom.
[00:51:39.781 --> 00:51:42.463]  About peace, love, and freedom.
[00:51:42.463 --> 00:51:45.146]  And education, re-education for the public.
[00:51:45.146 --> 00:51:45.846]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:51:45.846 --> 00:51:46.867]  In the Soviet camp, yes.
[00:51:46.867 --> 00:51:53.833]  Educating the public, letting them know what the laws are here in the state of Texas, that it is legal for you to open carry a long gun here in the state of Texas.
[00:51:53.833 --> 00:51:56.996]  Would you like to see that open carry law go a little bit further?
[00:51:56.996 --> 00:52:00.099]  Absolutely, I'd like to see, I'd like to be able to open carry my handgun.
[00:52:00.543 --> 00:52:02.544]  You know, that's something that I'm most comfortable with.
[00:52:02.544 --> 00:52:04.464]  You know, right now I have to conceal my handgun.
[00:52:04.464 --> 00:52:06.665]  I have two handguns on me right now that are concealed.
[00:52:06.665 --> 00:52:09.206]  And I would love to open carry those handguns.
[00:52:09.206 --> 00:52:17.388]  Right, I think it's so frustrating because with the concealed carry, you can only let people know you got it if you are gonna kill them.
[00:52:17.388 --> 00:52:21.150]  I mean, I think that's kind of a backwards cause there.
[00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:23.130]  Well, concealed carry is about personal protection.
[00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:26.971]  Just like, you know, carrying a firearm, it can be about personal protection.
[00:52:26.971 --> 00:52:28.432]  But also, it's also about, you know,
[00:52:28.996 --> 00:52:29.497]  Hunting.
[00:52:29.497 --> 00:52:33.780]  It's about other different things that are out there also, not just, you know, coral protection.
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.181]  Right.
[00:52:36.141 --> 00:52:38.462]  We're getting ready to have this march.
[00:52:38.462 --> 00:52:50.665]  Ask him what he thinks of Bloomberg trying to shut down free speech of gun groups on Facebook and the fact that they tried to stop us from handing out our pro-gun magazines at South by Southwest.
[00:52:50.665 --> 00:52:57.986]  What do you think about Bloomberg trying to shut down the free speech, you know, people supporting the Second Amendment and gun rights on Facebook.
[00:52:57.986 --> 00:53:01.967]  They're shutting down those groups there that are very vocal about the Second Amendment.
[00:53:01.967 --> 00:53:04.868]  They tried to stop us from passing out magazines here last year.
[00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.592]  Well, there are a lot of things that I'm really disappointed with.
[00:53:09.592 --> 00:53:27.629]  I'm really disappointed the fact that our Attorney General Greg Abbott actually was on the, one of the attorneys that was actually supporting not allowing 18 year olds, 19, 20 year olds to be able to legally purchase a firearm from a gun, from a dealer.
[00:53:27.629 --> 00:53:28.670]  I'm disappointed in that.
[00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:36.858]  Because, you know, we allow these guys that are 18, 19, 20 to go overseas and, you know, to give their life for this country.
[00:53:36.858 --> 00:53:41.681]  But when they come back, you know, from serving their country, they're not allowed to purchase a firearm.
[00:53:41.681 --> 00:53:44.764]  So those are some of the things that I'm disappointed and very hurt over.
[00:53:45.987 --> 00:53:47.649]  Just a massive brainwashing.
[00:53:47.649 --> 00:53:49.291]  So that's kind of what we're out here to do today.
[00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:50.652]  It's just to educate.
[00:53:50.652 --> 00:53:53.375]  There's an international crowd here today.
[00:53:53.375 --> 00:53:56.239]  People have descended upon Austin for South by Southwest.
[00:53:56.239 --> 00:53:59.903]  They're going to get a little taste of Texas and our gun laws here.
[00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.484]  Leanne, I see different reports.
[00:54:01.484 --> 00:54:02.586]  200,000 to 300,000 extra people in the city.
[00:54:06.769 --> 00:54:08.270]  The things that we like most in Texas.
[00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:09.411]  We love our firearms.
[00:54:09.411 --> 00:54:10.432]  We love our freedom.
[00:54:10.432 --> 00:54:13.374]  And we're going to let the world know that here today.
[00:54:13.374 --> 00:54:13.875]  Absolutely.
[00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:18.399]  And by the way, I'm going to go take my concealed carry finally from Cargill coming up here soon.
[00:54:18.399 --> 00:54:19.199]  He's a great guy.
[00:54:19.199 --> 00:54:20.260]  Central Texas Gunworks.
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.061]  Great folks.
[00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:22.462]  I still haven't gotten my concealed carry, folks.
[00:54:22.462 --> 00:54:26.906]  I just carry a rifle in the truck because I just have never had time to go do it.
[00:54:27.546 --> 00:54:29.407]  Uh, but now I'm just, I've got to do it.
[00:54:29.407 --> 00:54:30.047]  I've got to do it.
[00:54:30.047 --> 00:54:31.867]  I've got to start caring at all times.
[00:54:31.867 --> 00:54:33.888]  There's so many threats and things we're going through.
[00:54:33.888 --> 00:54:39.209]  Liam, we're going to break here in a few minutes, but, uh, Jakari Jackson and you are going to be out there with your feed.
[00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:40.669]  Your Skype feed is crystal clear.
[00:54:40.669 --> 00:54:41.510]  The other one's bad.
[00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:46.271]  So we probably want to mainly go with your feed with you and Jakari marching together.
[00:54:47.311 --> 00:54:49.792]  Getting commentary, but who else should we talk to?
[00:54:49.792 --> 00:54:51.312]  Maybe Kit Daniels over there.
[00:54:51.312 --> 00:54:57.294]  Let's get Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com reporter's take on this to estimate the number.
[00:54:57.294 --> 00:55:02.736]  How many people does he estimate in this only one day planned event are already out there?
[00:55:02.736 --> 00:55:05.377]  I'd say at least 75, maybe even 100.
[00:55:05.377 --> 00:55:15.780]  Way, this is probably more, way more than what the attendance at the Bloomberg anti-gun event on Saturday morning, which had maybe less than, maybe five?
[00:55:16.618 --> 00:55:22.181]  Well, there were about five people on the dais calling for an end of pro-gun free speech, literally.
[00:55:22.181 --> 00:55:23.942]  They're now attacking the First Amendment savagely.
[00:55:23.942 --> 00:55:29.204]  And then they had about a dozen reporters out there sycophantically reporting all of it.
[00:55:29.204 --> 00:55:30.745]  Bloomberg would vomit out the lies.
[00:55:30.745 --> 00:55:32.586]  They would eat it and then vomit it back out on us.
[00:55:33.406 --> 00:55:35.728]  In a kind of circular logic situation.
[00:55:35.728 --> 00:55:39.711]  But this is an impromptu with one-day planning, two-day planning.
[00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:44.874]  Saturday, your article's up on Infowars.com, Kit, for folks that want to find more.
[00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.896]  What time is the event Saturday?
[00:55:46.896 --> 00:55:53.721]  The big march to... I believe it's going to be at noon, but... Same spot San Jacinto in Congress?
[00:55:54.494 --> 00:55:56.935]  What's the event, Saturday at noon?
[00:55:56.935 --> 00:55:56.995]  1130.
[00:55:56.995 --> 00:55:59.135]  We meet up at 1130, we'll probably march out about noon.
[00:55:59.135 --> 00:56:03.496]  Meet up at 1130, probably march about noon, same time, same place.
[00:56:03.496 --> 00:56:09.938]  Now listen, I know the Capitol Police get off their jurisdiction there at the Capitol, because they have a wider jurisdiction in the state.
[00:56:09.938 --> 00:56:15.299]  I know the Austin Police have not been as anti-open carry as some of the state police orders they've gotten.
[00:56:15.299 --> 00:56:20.160]  I know the state police individually are pro-Second Amendment, but they've been following some of the illegal orders.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.001]  In the past.
[00:56:22.001 --> 00:56:24.922]  Now who is going to be marching with you guys?
[00:56:24.922 --> 00:56:25.962]  Is it state police?
[00:56:25.962 --> 00:56:28.263]  Ask Kit, because I'm not clear on that.
[00:56:28.263 --> 00:56:31.644]  Or is it going to be Austin police?
[00:56:31.644 --> 00:56:36.106]  We're wondering which of the police are actually going to be escorting us today through the crowd.
[00:56:36.106 --> 00:56:37.266]  That group right there.
[00:56:37.266 --> 00:56:38.827]  Those are the Capitol Police.
[00:56:38.827 --> 00:56:41.508]  Those are Austin PD.
[00:56:41.508 --> 00:56:42.028]  That's what I thought.
[00:56:42.028 --> 00:56:44.089]  I didn't think the state police were going to be doing that.
[00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:46.670]  And again, we have this right to open carry.
[00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:55.955]  And if they want to have police there, show that some tranny doesn't come up and punch one of our people in the nose, which has never happened, that's fine.
[00:56:55.955 --> 00:56:57.656]  The point is, we're going to exercise these rights.
[00:56:57.656 --> 00:56:59.597]  We're going to sit at the front of the bus if we want to.
[00:56:59.597 --> 00:57:01.097]  We're going to eat at the lunch counters if we want to.
[00:57:01.097 --> 00:57:03.058]  We're going to vote if we want to.
[00:57:03.058 --> 00:57:05.920]  This is the real cutting edge of the civil rights movement, Leanne.
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:11.523]  Exactly, and that's what we just want to educate everyone out here, that we are doing this for them.
[00:57:11.523 --> 00:57:16.265]  So whether they agree with it or not, we are fighting for their freedom, for their liberty.
[00:57:16.265 --> 00:57:17.386]  The march is about to begin.
[00:57:17.386 --> 00:57:22.369]  Leanne, walk over to the police if you can right now and get us some shots of that.
[00:57:22.369 --> 00:57:27.772]  We'll come back from break, maybe talk to them briefly as you guys get ready to march here in just a few minutes.
[00:57:27.772 --> 00:57:29.713]  True Paul Revere is marching for the Second Amendment.
[00:57:29.713 --> 00:57:34.496]  If Josh or Dew or whoever's running that camera would aim it at the police, that'd be good.
[00:57:34.496 --> 00:57:35.597]  Because I want to see that.
[00:57:35.597 --> 00:57:36.017]  Where are they?
[00:57:36.607 --> 00:57:38.311]  Losing my feet.
[00:57:38.311 --> 00:57:38.932]  I can't see them.
[00:57:38.932 --> 00:57:40.736]  Are they just waiting over there, or what's going to go on here?
[00:57:40.736 --> 00:57:42.399]  I can't hear them.
[00:57:42.399 --> 00:57:43.281]  They're just waiting.
[00:57:43.281 --> 00:57:46.007]  They're just waiting over there, waiting for us to start marching.
[00:57:46.007 --> 00:57:47.750]  What is that, about four Austin police?
[00:57:49.861 --> 00:57:50.822]  Four.
[00:57:50.822 --> 00:57:51.722]  There are four now.
[00:57:51.722 --> 00:57:55.445]  I saw a few more earlier, but I guess these will be our official escorts.
[00:57:55.445 --> 00:58:02.429]  Now remember, folks, all these trendies are going to learn, not just citizens, you know, of Soviet Russia who've had their guns taken.
[00:58:02.429 --> 00:58:04.231]  It can happen here as well.
[00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:06.492]  And it's not only government that gets to have guns.
[00:58:06.492 --> 00:58:07.793]  It's we the people.
[00:58:07.793 --> 00:58:12.096]  And I took a bunch of Californians out, Hollywood people, yesterday with Mike Judge.
[00:58:12.096 --> 00:58:13.257]  He's a Texan and gun owner.
[00:58:14.571 --> 00:58:16.533]  We had them all shoot guns, they're all addicted.
[00:58:16.533 --> 00:58:20.676]  So that's how you convert the Borg, is you take them out shooting.
[00:58:20.676 --> 00:58:25.260]  And we had these, you know, Hollywood folks, actresses, actors, you name it, shooting 50 cals.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.983]  I mean, they didn't just shoot guns for the first time, they went right to 50 cals.
[00:58:28.983 --> 00:58:33.687]  They went right to M308 Reapers and M4223s.
[00:58:33.687 --> 00:58:36.269]  And it was a beautiful thing.
[00:58:36.269 --> 00:58:38.531]  I think I converted at least four people yesterday to Liberty.
[00:58:41.636 --> 00:58:43.661]  Live March, coming up, second hour.
[00:58:43.661 --> 00:58:45.867]  Paul Revere, 21st Century.
[00:58:45.867 --> 00:58:47.852]  Taking our freedoms back by exercising.
[00:58:50.435 --> 00:59:01.122]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:59:01.122 --> 00:59:03.183]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:59:03.183 --> 00:59:04.064]  Fluoride!
[00:59:04.064 --> 00:59:06.005]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:59:06.005 --> 00:59:12.570]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:17.333]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:59:20.455 --> 00:59:21.035]  We're good.
[00:59:53.587 --> 00:59:55.988]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.988 --> 01:00:05.470]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:06.790]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:08.550]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:10.311]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:11.891]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.891 --> 01:00:13.431]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:17.632]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.632 --> 01:00:21.713]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.579 --> 01:00:46.586]  All right, Leanne McAdoo is out on the street at the corner of San Jacinto and Congress where it looks like about a hundred now, more people are showing up, have met.
[01:00:46.586 --> 01:00:51.410]  Saturday I had the idea to have an open carry march and turned out they were already doing one Saturday.
[01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:54.772]  I said, why not do another one on Wednesday?
[01:00:54.772 --> 01:00:56.234]  We started promoting it Monday night.
[01:00:57.099 --> 01:00:59.381]  Not a hundred people out there open carrying.
[01:00:59.381 --> 01:01:04.424]  When Bloomberg was down here basically saying, ban guns, ban free speech, don't let folks promote the Second Amendment on Facebook.
[01:01:04.424 --> 01:01:06.325]  They already tried to censor people.
[01:01:06.325 --> 01:01:09.627]  Really, these are authoritarian dirtbags who have their own bodyguards.
[01:01:09.627 --> 01:01:17.192]  And so Leanne is out there and they've got a shot of the crowd of about a hundred people that are getting ready to march right into the heart of the trendies.
[01:01:17.192 --> 01:01:24.837]  And Jakari's internet connection with their phone's not working too well, so I'm going to have those two team up so that we can get Jakari's take on this.
[01:01:24.837 --> 01:01:26.198]  Leanne, is the march beginning?
[01:01:27.755 --> 01:01:44.907]  Well, right now Justin is giving them all of the safety precautions there to just make sure everyone's on the same page, everyone knows what's happening here, what the aim here is with this march, to just kind of re-educate and let people know that there's no reason for them to fear these legal gun owners.
[01:01:44.907 --> 01:01:45.688]  Jakari, what's your take?
[01:01:46.229 --> 01:01:50.412]  Well, I'm just glad people came out here and we have a crowd of about, I guess, about 50 people now.
[01:01:50.412 --> 01:01:55.034]  Now, I do want to be clear to the people who aren't aware of the safety regulations we're working with.
[01:01:55.034 --> 01:01:56.575]  Come and take it, Austin.
[01:01:56.575 --> 01:02:04.180]  So, their safety regulations, they want everybody to come out here, if you're armed, to have your rifle pointed down or your long gun pointed down with a strap.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:07.662]  Also, if you're carrying a black powder pistol, have your pistol holstered.
[01:02:07.662 --> 01:02:08.743]  And we're near the Capitol.
[01:02:08.743 --> 01:02:12.145]  Texas DPS does not like open carriers on Capitol grounds, which
[01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:15.279]  It's a bunch of bull, but... They will arrest you illegally.
[01:02:15.279 --> 01:02:17.820]  If you come to this area, do not step on Capitol grounds.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:21.762]  We're at 12th and San Jacinto, but just make sure that you do not walk on Capitol grounds.
[01:02:21.762 --> 01:02:22.703]  Absolutely great point.
[01:02:22.703 --> 01:02:24.984]  Let's march over and talk to those cops briefly.
[01:02:24.984 --> 01:02:27.905]  In this short segment, we're going to come back and the march is going to kick off.
[01:02:27.905 --> 01:02:38.630]  Officially led by the great Texians, who are again there to counter the re-education where they're trying to demonize guns and make people think they're all illegal.
[01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:40.771]  They're not illegal and we will openly carry them.
[01:02:41.411 --> 01:02:46.896]  Used to, people carried their guns in their rifle racks, but the cops keep pulling you over, so that extincted that legal behavior.
[01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:49.458]  We have to take these God-given rights back.
[01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:50.779]  Let's go back to the feed.
[01:02:50.779 --> 01:03:00.067]  They're approaching these specialized citizens who have been hired by us to supposedly be our guardians, the Austin Police, which on average are pretty good cops.
[01:03:00.067 --> 01:03:02.269]  So we'll see how they act when we try to talk to them.
[01:03:02.269 --> 01:03:02.970]  Go ahead, Jakari.
[01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:07.534]  So you guys are going to be escorting us through downtown today?
[01:03:08.942 --> 01:03:17.232]  Yeah, we'll be providing escort, make sure that, you know, the Second Amendment folks have their rights to march peacefully.
[01:03:17.645 --> 01:03:18.205]  Okay.
[01:03:18.205 --> 01:03:24.469]  Now, I know the Austin Police Department has been friendly to open carriers who've had issues with DPS, but you guys aren't DPS, right?
[01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:25.369]  That's correct.
[01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:26.250]  We're Austin Police.
[01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:29.051]  Austin Police Department is going to uphold our Second Amendment rights.
[01:03:29.051 --> 01:03:31.212]  They're going to escort us through downtown.
[01:03:31.212 --> 01:03:32.373]  Hopefully we won't have any issues.
[01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:34.554]  Hopefully nobody will get arrested for jaywalking.
[01:03:34.554 --> 01:03:38.916]  But I hope we'll have a good day, and thank you for your time, officer, and we'll see you here in a few minutes.
[01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.017]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:42.878]  And unfortunately, sir, what do you think about these armed marches?
[01:03:42.878 --> 01:03:44.759]  Do you think that's good for the Second Amendment?
[01:03:44.759 --> 01:03:46.060]  Or what is your opinion of that?
[01:03:47.037 --> 01:03:58.645]  I believe in the Second Amendment, but I also believe that anybody has the right, if they want to stand on the street corner and preach, or anybody wants to, whatever their cause is, they have a right to peacefully display their
[01:04:03.194 --> 01:04:04.095]  They're right.
[01:04:04.095 --> 01:04:09.457]  And whatever that case may be, as long as it's within the boundaries of the law.
[01:04:09.457 --> 01:04:10.358]  Put your mind at ease.
[01:04:10.358 --> 01:04:12.919]  We're definitely working to have a safe event.
[01:04:12.919 --> 01:04:17.662]  We're asking everybody who comes out here to have their rifles or their long guns strapped to their backs pointed down.
[01:04:17.662 --> 01:04:20.183]  We're doing chamber checks right now over there on the side.
[01:04:20.183 --> 01:04:22.624]  So hopefully it'll be a safe day and won't have any issues.
[01:04:22.624 --> 01:04:23.205]  That's great.
[01:04:23.205 --> 01:04:24.345]  Yes, we agree.
[01:04:24.345 --> 01:04:24.926]  All right.
[01:04:24.926 --> 01:04:25.286]  Thank you, sir.
[01:04:25.566 --> 01:04:27.027]  That's why I like Austin, Texas.
[01:04:27.027 --> 01:04:28.808]  See, the police will actually talk to you on average.
[01:04:28.808 --> 01:04:30.008]  They're not arrogant.
[01:04:30.008 --> 01:04:32.970]  And the people like the police a lot better in this town than a lot of other cities.
[01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:36.472]  Most areas of the country, you'd be screamed at right there.
[01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:39.073]  And because some cops think they live in North Korea.
[01:04:39.073 --> 01:04:40.074]  They really don't.
[01:04:40.074 --> 01:04:41.174]  And that's what the feds want.
[01:04:41.174 --> 01:04:44.676]  They want that imperious attitude that is not happening in Austin, Texas.
[01:04:44.676 --> 01:04:46.477]  Very refreshing, huh, Leanna Jakari?
[01:04:46.477 --> 01:04:47.818]  Very, very refreshing.
[01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:50.460]  Actually talking to us like we're human beings.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:56.626]  In most departments, that cop would get fired for daring to talk to a slave, but he wants his Second Amendment, too.
[01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:57.627]  It's his right, too.
[01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.969]  We'll be right back when the march begins.
[01:05:00.566 --> 01:05:09.655]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:05:09.655 --> 01:05:18.063]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:05:18.063 --> 01:05:22.727]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:05:22.947 --> 01:05:29.732]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:29.732 --> 01:05:36.897]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:05:36.897 --> 01:05:43.922]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:05:43.922 --> 01:05:48.265]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:05:48.405 --> 01:05:51.786]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:05:51.786 --> 01:05:53.667]  You will be supporting a free press.
[01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:58.089]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:05:58.089 --> 01:06:00.570]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:01.610]  The facts are in.
[01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:03.011]  The studies are legion.
[01:06:03.011 --> 01:06:10.534]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:13.955]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:06:14.335 --> 01:06:14.895]  Simple.
[01:06:14.895 --> 01:06:19.637]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:06:19.637 --> 01:06:25.339]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:06:25.339 --> 01:06:41.685]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:06:41.685 --> 01:06:43.526]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:06:43.626 --> 01:06:46.249]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:06:46.249 --> 01:06:48.412]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[01:06:48.412 --> 01:06:53.979]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:06:53.979 --> 01:06:58.385]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:06:58.385 --> 01:06:59.646]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[01:07:00.487 --> 01:07:03.330]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:08.455]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:07:08.455 --> 01:07:16.583]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:07:16.583 --> 01:07:21.107]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:07:21.107 --> 01:07:24.931]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:07:25.071 --> 01:07:31.015]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:07:31.015 --> 01:07:34.177]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:07:34.177 --> 01:07:39.561]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:07:39.561 --> 01:07:47.746]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:07:47.746 --> 01:07:47.926]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:07:57.393 --> 01:08:07.462]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:09.745]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:17.911]  Alright, folks, the march has begun.
[01:08:17.911 --> 01:08:25.656]  A whole bunch of national and local TV news crews have just shown up to cover the Paul Revere return.
[01:08:25.656 --> 01:08:36.822]  1776, open carry march in Austin, Texas, to expose South by Southwest as a World Bank-funded and sponsored Bloomberg anti-gun, anti-free speech event.
[01:08:36.822 --> 01:08:40.604]  They're trying to ban free speech, pro-gun speech on the internet, starting with Facebook.
[01:08:40.604 --> 01:08:41.565]  That's been national news.
[01:08:42.465 --> 01:08:46.047]  And they were here talking about how they're going to take over the internet and censor everyone's free speech.
[01:08:46.047 --> 01:08:47.247]  The march has begun.
[01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:54.210]  Let's get some audio of 75 to 100 people in an impromptu march, marching down Congress.
[01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:54.851]  All right.
[01:08:54.851 --> 01:08:56.812]  Hey, Kit.
[01:08:56.812 --> 01:08:59.973]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:08.577]  Kit was just explaining to me that there's quite a few news stations out here that are covering this, but we had to drive one of them off because they were apparently trying to do a hit piece or something.
[01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.658]  And we have a man right here that saw the whole thing.
[01:09:12.414 --> 01:09:13.335]  What happened?
[01:09:13.335 --> 01:09:17.759]  Yeah, a journalist came up to me and wanted to know, he declared, why do you have this rifle?
[01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:19.260]  What does this represent?
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.841]  And I said, it represents human liberty.
[01:09:20.841 --> 01:09:22.042]  And to him, that wasn't good enough.
[01:09:22.042 --> 01:09:26.106]  He wanted to have the title, section, code, whatever law allowed me.
[01:09:26.106 --> 01:09:32.030]  And I wanted to make it very clear to him that our Bill of Rights enumerates our rights.
[01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:35.293]  This isn't an agreement with the government where they allow us rights.
[01:09:35.293 --> 01:09:39.176]  This is, no, not only do we have these rights, you're not going to take them.
[01:09:40.407 --> 01:09:41.148]  But it was a hit piece.
[01:09:41.148 --> 01:09:42.188]  I did call me old journalist.
[01:09:42.188 --> 01:09:45.391]  Eventually, he tried to run behind the reporters and I told him to speak up.
[01:09:45.391 --> 01:09:47.532]  Stop speaking underneath his breath and sound so snarky.
[01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:48.313]  These people aren't your friends.
[01:09:48.313 --> 01:09:49.954]  He ran away.
[01:09:49.954 --> 01:09:51.315]  Listen, good job, guys.
[01:09:51.315 --> 01:09:52.756]  Interview everybody at the end of the march.
[01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:54.957]  Get at the head of that march, Leigh-Anne.
[01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:56.538]  Come on, you and Jakari.
[01:09:56.538 --> 01:09:57.979]  I want to see this historic...
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:05.848]  We don't want to get... We're jaywalking now, walking against the... You saw what happened here a couple weeks ago to that poor girl.
[01:10:05.848 --> 01:10:07.150]  Jacari Jackson's up there.
[01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:07.991]  You guys getting feed from her?
[01:10:07.991 --> 01:10:08.331]  That's right.
[01:10:08.331 --> 01:10:09.252]  They'll tackle you.
[01:10:09.252 --> 01:10:10.894]  They didn't really tackle her.
[01:10:10.894 --> 01:10:15.219]  The point is, is that the march has begun to take our rights back.
[01:10:15.219 --> 01:10:17.622]  A right you don't exercise does not exist.
[01:10:18.703 --> 01:10:20.004]  And this is so exciting.
[01:10:20.004 --> 01:10:25.788]  I mean, I would have been happy if 10 people showed up, just have a little mini-march to get the media coverage kicked off.
[01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:36.655]  Now, guys, when you talk to the media, the key here is to explain this is Texans saying no to Bloomberg's plan to not just try to ban the Second Amendment, but to try to go after the First Amendment.
[01:10:36.655 --> 01:10:41.398]  The mayors have quit and gone public, over 50 of them, from his group of Mayors Against Freedom.
[01:10:41.398 --> 01:10:42.759]  I mean, Mayors Against Illegal Guns.
[01:10:44.079 --> 01:10:48.343]  And they have said they're in the meetings and the plan is to ban the guns.
[01:10:48.343 --> 01:10:49.405]  Well, of course.
[01:10:49.405 --> 01:10:55.911]  And they had Selectmen go public who were in the group in New York and release the document that the plan is to register and then confiscate.
[01:10:55.911 --> 01:10:58.434]  So it's all about exposing the plan is really to confiscate.
[01:11:00.478 --> 01:11:06.019]  Mike Martinez admitted last year, and to plug the big march that's happening Saturday.
[01:11:06.019 --> 01:11:09.700]  If a hundred people or seventy-five showed up today, let's talk about a hundred to me.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:15.362]  If seventy-five to a hundred people showed up today with really no promotion, Saturday, eleven-thirty, Sanchez Senate and Congress.
[01:11:15.362 --> 01:11:16.602]  This is happening all over the country.
[01:11:16.602 --> 01:11:20.483]  There's all sorts of national marches, regional marches going on.
[01:11:20.483 --> 01:11:23.084]  We are never going to stop.
[01:11:23.084 --> 01:11:25.364]  We are never going to back down.
[01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:27.785]  We are going to continue to exercise these rights.
[01:11:29.599 --> 01:11:31.321]  Leanne McAdoo.
[01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:44.332]  So that's key when you guys talk to the establishment media to let them know that this is organic resistance to tyranny and that in the past if one guy was walking around with a gun over his shoulder they would arrest him.
[01:11:44.332 --> 01:11:46.554]  We need to get people acclimated.
[01:11:46.554 --> 01:11:48.496]  They desensitized people to liberty.
[01:11:49.758 --> 01:11:51.259]  They've gotten where people don't want liberty.
[01:11:51.259 --> 01:11:58.543]  We're here to show people and psychologically inoculate them that the Second Amendment is good, not dirty, not bad.
[01:11:58.543 --> 01:12:02.185]  Because that's what the Attorney General said years ago to the media.
[01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:08.349]  Eric Holder, he said on C-SPAN, you need to demonize guns, you need to brainwash the public against them in the hands of citizens.
[01:12:08.889 --> 01:12:12.331]  Well, look, everybody needs to be able to be armed if they want to be.
[01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:24.678]  It's not feminist to teach women not to ever use a gun or not protect themselves or to vomit, urinate, or poop on people, which is what the Democrats literally teach women to vomit or pee on people if they try to rape them.
[01:12:24.678 --> 01:12:30.502]  No, you pull out your handgun and you shoot them five times in the chest if somebody's assaulting you.
[01:12:30.502 --> 01:12:31.642]  I mean, that's real feminism.
[01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:35.232]  And I'll tell you what real feminism is.
[01:12:35.232 --> 01:12:38.717]  It's strong women with strong families with strong culture.
[01:12:38.717 --> 01:12:39.978]  They're destroying our culture.
[01:12:39.978 --> 01:12:41.540]  We want to arm women.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:48.368]  We want to arm minorities so their inner cities aren't hell pits of disarmament like Chicago and New York.
[01:12:48.368 --> 01:12:49.490]  We want to arm everyone.
[01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:53.433]  And what I love about this event is all the Hispanics and black folks that are out there.
[01:12:53.433 --> 01:12:54.674]  They hate the Tea Party.
[01:12:54.674 --> 01:12:55.735]  That's why they say it's racist.
[01:12:55.735 --> 01:13:00.199]  That's why they say gun groups are the new Klan, even though pro-gun was started to stop the Klan.
[01:13:00.199 --> 01:13:01.861]  The NRA was started to stop the Klan.
[01:13:01.861 --> 01:13:16.233]  And I just love the fact that everywhere real liberty groups, the Transcend Party, have everybody together who are unified by red blood and liberty, thinking the same thoughts of freedom, wanting their children to be free, coming together with a true brotherhood.
[01:13:17.014 --> 01:13:33.628]  True sisterhood, true kinsmanship, the things that people are really hungry for, unifying ourselves into a tribe of freedom, a 1776 culture of manhood and feminine power and strength and honor and true wild human potential.
[01:13:33.628 --> 01:13:35.650]  That's what liberty is all about.
[01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:37.512]  That is the animating contest.
[01:13:37.512 --> 01:13:39.734]  Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, any comments?
[01:13:41.072 --> 01:13:42.973]  Well, talk about an organic march.
[01:13:42.973 --> 01:13:48.795]  I think yesterday when we spoke with Justin, there was about 19 people that RSVP'd.
[01:13:48.795 --> 01:13:54.858]  And now there are clearly about 100 plus out here in just less than 24 hours.
[01:13:54.858 --> 01:13:58.079]  We've definitely mobilized the troops.
[01:13:58.079 --> 01:14:01.041]  And this is on a Wednesday.
[01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:04.022]  And then Saturday, I predict it'll be 500 to 1,000.
[01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:06.323]  We had 1,500 in San Antonio.
[01:14:06.323 --> 01:14:08.484]  And I guess I better come out there Saturday.
[01:14:08.484 --> 01:14:10.465]  All of those groups together.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:23.162]  You know, quite frankly, today I shot probably, I don't know, 75 rounds of .50 cal yesterday, and my problem is, if I lay down prone and shoot, it doesn't hurt my lower back, but if I stand up and hand shoot it, or stand up
[01:14:24.051 --> 01:14:29.334]  On a fence post, shooting it from position, it blows my lower back out.
[01:14:29.334 --> 01:14:39.640]  They're going to have to wheel me around here in a wheelbarrow pretty soon, but if I'm able to walk on Saturday, I'll be out there literally, folks, at my lower back.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:46.325]  I've now learned I've got to only shoot 50 cals prone, and I can't hand shoot them anymore, because it doesn't hurt my shoulder.
[01:14:46.325 --> 01:14:48.106]  It blows my lower back out.
[01:14:48.106 --> 01:14:52.888]  I mean, I've got swelling in my lower back, but you can rebuild me.
[01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.257]  Better, stronger, faster?
[01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.739]  A better Texas hillbilly?
[01:14:57.739 --> 01:15:00.981]  Oh my gosh, thank God I'm a hillbilly from Texas.
[01:15:00.981 --> 01:15:08.066]  Let's thank God I'm not one of these android brainwashed people, glow-in-the-dark folks that don't even know how to tie their shoelaces and are so soft.
[01:15:08.066 --> 01:15:09.667]  Anyways, getting back to what I was saying,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:21.223]  It is the barbarian, trailblazing spirit that brought Leif Erikson to the New World 600, 700 years before Christopher Columbus.
[01:15:21.223 --> 01:15:25.225]  And it's going to be that same spirit of human potential that will lead us to the stars, folks.
[01:15:25.225 --> 01:15:26.305]  Not the nanny state.
[01:15:26.305 --> 01:15:27.526]  Not the dehumanizing forces.
[01:15:28.586 --> 01:15:31.448]  They're kind of stopping in front of the Capitol now, and then I guess they're going to march.
[01:15:31.448 --> 01:15:37.792]  The key, I know they're going to do this, is to march into South by Southwest, in and around the trendies, so they're going to flip out.
[01:15:37.792 --> 01:15:39.293]  Leanne, go talk to Jakari.
[01:15:39.293 --> 01:15:49.320]  Because I want to find out, I mean they can lead the march wherever they want, but maybe talk to the media, but strategy here, we need to march down Congress, and down to 6th Street, down to 2nd Street.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:49.860]  What's happening?
[01:15:50.652 --> 01:15:52.113]  Where's the route today?
[01:15:52.113 --> 01:15:53.775]  Well, the route will be going down Congress.
[01:15:53.775 --> 01:16:01.622]  We're going to be in the South by Southwest area, but we're going to start going straight down Congress right after we finish this group photo here.
[01:16:01.622 --> 01:16:06.506]  Maybe we can get a shot of all these patriots out here exercising their Second Amendment rights.
[01:16:06.506 --> 01:16:07.907]  Leave them in 1776 worldwide!
[01:16:07.907 --> 01:16:08.267]  1776 worldwide!
[01:16:08.267 --> 01:16:08.748]  1776 worldwide!
[01:16:08.748 --> 01:16:09.308]  Come on!
[01:16:18.868 --> 01:16:22.470]  Get him to say, get him to say Molon Lobby!
[01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:25.571]  Everybody say Molon Lobby!
[01:16:25.571 --> 01:16:28.412]  Molon Lobby!
[01:16:28.412 --> 01:16:31.074]  Molon Lobby!
[01:16:31.074 --> 01:16:33.835]  Molon Furbies!
[01:16:33.835 --> 01:16:35.075]  What'd he say?
[01:16:35.075 --> 01:16:42.279]  Well, we do have one woman out here that is expressing her right to bear her guns.
[01:16:42.279 --> 01:16:45.220]  Trying to avoid getting that on camera.
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.181]  You're not supposed to have your headlights on during the day.
[01:16:48.736 --> 01:16:52.400]  That's wasting energy.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.503]  It's a frivolous exploitation demonstration.
[01:16:55.503 --> 01:16:55.863]  I'm joking.
[01:16:55.863 --> 01:16:58.026]  Hey, that's legal here in Austin, you know.
[01:16:58.026 --> 01:16:58.786]  I know, I hear you.
[01:16:58.786 --> 01:16:59.727]  Better fight for those rights.
[01:16:59.727 --> 01:17:03.031]  Yeah, because it's not about liberal or conservative, it's about freedom.
[01:17:03.031 --> 01:17:03.751]  Exactly.
[01:17:03.751 --> 01:17:07.635]  That is quite barbarian, actually, a woman running around topless with a gun.
[01:17:07.635 --> 01:17:10.498]  I mean, and she's rolling with us.
[01:17:10.498 --> 01:17:11.259]  Her sign says,
[01:17:11.937 --> 01:17:14.898]  More guns and more boobies.
[01:17:33.171 --> 01:17:34.412]  Ja'Kari, give us your take on this.
[01:17:34.412 --> 01:17:35.832]  We're about to move down here.
[01:17:35.832 --> 01:17:37.913]  We have the APD escort.
[01:17:37.913 --> 01:17:39.814]  Also, we have the women in black out here.
[01:17:39.814 --> 01:17:41.555]  They're out there protesting war.
[01:17:41.555 --> 01:17:43.216]  They're out here every Wednesday.
[01:17:43.216 --> 01:17:47.738]  And, you know, some nice ladies out here who, I guess, also support our Second Amendment rights.
[01:17:47.738 --> 01:17:53.100]  You know, I run into a lot of liberal women who now own guns that are like, I'm a liberal, but I like your show.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.801]  And I'm like, no, you just want freedom.
[01:17:54.801 --> 01:18:00.884]  The crowd is still... Ja'Kari is going to see if... Get these ladies' take on what we're doing out here today.
[01:18:02.421 --> 01:18:03.681]  Alright, so we're moving in.
[01:18:03.681 --> 01:18:05.162]  That direction.
[01:18:05.162 --> 01:18:09.443]  Yes, yes, so we'll try to get over here and talk to some of these nice ladies.
[01:18:09.443 --> 01:18:10.724]  Those are good looking 76's.
[01:18:10.724 --> 01:18:11.904]  Hello, hello ladies.
[01:18:11.904 --> 01:18:14.185]  How you doing ladies?
[01:18:14.185 --> 01:18:18.106]  Hi, I'm Zachary Jackson, InfoWars.com.
[01:18:18.106 --> 01:18:19.846]  What are you ladies doing out here today?
[01:18:19.846 --> 01:18:25.408]  We're out here every Wednesday from 12 to 1, standing for peace.
[01:18:25.408 --> 01:18:28.329]  We're against violence of any kind, anywhere.
[01:18:29.693 --> 01:18:32.077]  That we should have resolutions for peace.
[01:18:32.077 --> 01:18:33.499]  Can I get a peace hug?
[01:18:33.499 --> 01:18:34.240]  Can I get a peace hug?
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.542]  Cargill is now going after the ladies.
[01:18:41.184 --> 01:18:42.005]  Oh yeah.
[01:18:42.005 --> 01:18:43.346]  We want peace as well.
[01:18:43.346 --> 01:18:48.891]  Everybody's out here peaceably assembled, carrying their long rifles, and we want peace.
[01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.092]  Texas peace, like he said.
[01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:52.234]  You know, ask her this though, Jakari.
[01:18:52.234 --> 01:19:01.602]  What we want is a ban on offensive violence, but defensive violence is a very good thing because it restrains tyrants everywhere.
[01:19:01.602 --> 01:19:02.563]  There's a difference.
[01:19:02.563 --> 01:19:04.805]  We're against offensive violence.
[01:19:05.336 --> 01:19:07.798]  So, excuse me ladies, let me ask you this.
[01:19:07.798 --> 01:19:10.040]  You see everybody out here with their long guns.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.682]  Now, you know, they're using their long guns as a preventative measure.
[01:19:12.682 --> 01:19:19.867]  They're not actually out here trying to menace anybody, but do you agree with firearms for self-defense?
[01:19:19.867 --> 01:19:25.972]  Well, I think that the only people who are very responsible should have guns.
[01:19:25.972 --> 01:19:31.937]  My father had guns and he went hunting, but he never used them for anything except hunting.
[01:19:33.194 --> 01:19:35.355]  He didn't even think of him for self-defense.
[01:19:35.355 --> 01:19:36.315]  Bring up offense.
[01:19:36.315 --> 01:19:44.098]  The point is, is that violence of any kind, if someone's assaulting you... He wants you to bring up the point of offense.
[01:19:44.098 --> 01:19:44.598]  It doesn't matter.
[01:19:44.598 --> 01:19:45.179]  Hey, hey, listen.
[01:19:45.179 --> 01:19:46.039]  Listen, I gotta go to break.
[01:19:46.039 --> 01:19:48.000]  You guys go keep doing interviews for the Nightly News.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.500]  Let's get this march started.
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:53.622]  We're gonna continue to cover it, right straight through, as we openly carry.
[01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.863]  Get in the nest of the South by Southwest.
[01:19:55.863 --> 01:19:57.803]  That's where there's gonna be the fireworks.
[01:19:57.803 --> 01:19:58.504]  Stay with us.
[01:19:58.504 --> 01:19:59.444]  It's all coming up.
[01:20:00.498 --> 01:20:01.859]  Attention gun owners.
[01:20:01.859 --> 01:20:06.661]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[01:20:06.661 --> 01:20:10.383]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[01:20:10.383 --> 01:20:12.745]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.
[01:20:12.745 --> 01:20:15.146]  Is civilian legal in all 50 states.

[01:20:30.274 --> 01:20:31.394]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:35.875]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:35.875 --> 01:20:41.596]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:20:41.596 --> 01:20:45.177]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:23:58.203 --> 01:24:06.753]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:09.904 --> 01:24:16.006]  All right, I can see personally in live feeds upwards of eight different mainstream media TV cameras down there.
[01:24:16.006 --> 01:24:28.009]  So the mission's already a success with the open carry to take over South by Southwest politically and not let Bloomberg come to our house, Texas, and try to ban free speech as well as Second Amendment.
[01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:32.451]  I mean, they've gone to Facebook and are going to, like, not let under-18s even see gun sites.
[01:24:32.451 --> 01:24:37.934]  They're going to put it in the same category as porn and start banning pro-gun memes and stuff.
[01:24:37.934 --> 01:24:39.035]  This is insane.
[01:24:39.035 --> 01:24:41.956]  So we'll just intensify our InfoWars ten times that.
[01:24:41.956 --> 01:24:44.138]  We're already winning culturally.
[01:24:44.138 --> 01:24:46.699]  By the way, there's an article on InfoWars.com.
[01:24:46.699 --> 01:24:50.421]  College group bans white people from diversity happy hour.
[01:24:50.421 --> 01:24:51.902]  This space is not for white people.
[01:24:53.305 --> 01:24:55.026]  And that's happening all over the country.
[01:24:55.026 --> 01:24:56.986]  Whites are being told they're not welcome.
[01:24:56.986 --> 01:25:00.848]  And, of course, they really want to be there because they hate themselves and have been taught that they are the devil.
[01:25:00.848 --> 01:25:05.229]  So now they're threatening, you know, discrimination suits and stuff like that.
[01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:09.911]  This is what they've done, saying anybody that's pro-gun hates black people.
[01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:11.451]  That has no place in reality.
[01:25:11.451 --> 01:25:14.452]  But MSNBC says it on a weekly basis.
[01:25:14.452 --> 01:25:16.593]  So that black folks won't become pro-Second Amendment.
[01:25:16.593 --> 01:25:17.813]  I mean, why shouldn't they be?
[01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:19.094]  They need guns like anybody else.
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.362]  Good people need guns.
[01:25:21.362 --> 01:25:23.144]  Why are you bad and can't have a gun?
[01:25:23.144 --> 01:25:25.647]  Why is it all the black cities that have gun bans?
[01:25:25.647 --> 01:25:26.968]  So then only the criminals have it.
[01:25:26.968 --> 01:25:29.271]  This has all been thought out, folks.
[01:25:29.271 --> 01:25:31.333]  Because the Democrats are the party of the Klan.
[01:25:31.333 --> 01:25:33.236]  They weren't going to let black people ever have guns, folks.
[01:25:34.258 --> 01:25:36.699]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:25:36.699 --> 01:25:44.563]  And I just love seeing a lot of black folks and Hispanics and people out there wanting their Second Amendment because that's what this is all about.
[01:25:44.563 --> 01:25:51.606]  And a lot of black folks I've talked to, I've done like Rob Redding's big syndicated show and others, and they really don't believe the Tea Party would welcome them to come to an event.
[01:25:51.606 --> 01:25:54.247]  They really think there's a bunch of people that hate them there.
[01:25:55.270 --> 01:26:00.395]  And I'm sure there might be somebody in a tea party event that doesn't like black people or vice versa, but there's black people don't like white people.
[01:26:00.395 --> 01:26:01.577]  Look at the knockout game.
[01:26:01.577 --> 01:26:06.582]  I don't then see every black person out there and think they hate me and want to knock me out.
[01:26:06.582 --> 01:26:10.746]  If I'm in an alleyway and some white guy looks like a thug and starts coming up, I'm going to get ready.
[01:26:10.746 --> 01:26:13.089]  Some black guy looks like a thug comes up, I'm going to get ready.
[01:26:13.089 --> 01:26:15.371]  But I mean, because they act like thugs, not because they're black or white.
[01:26:17.355 --> 01:26:21.777]  Continuing here with Jakari Jackson and LeAnn McAdoo.
[01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:25.499]  I can't wait till you guys get all the way down to 6th Street.
[01:26:25.499 --> 01:26:27.320]  Get all the way down to 2nd Street.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.201]  I think you guys said march in front of the W. You should just march all over.
[01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:31.842]  But I see you've stopped again, Jakari.
[01:26:31.842 --> 01:26:32.342]  What's going on?
[01:26:33.513 --> 01:26:37.255]  Okay, well I'm here with Justin, you know, the head of Come and Take It Austin.
[01:26:37.255 --> 01:26:38.856]  How's this thing going so far?
[01:26:38.856 --> 01:26:41.278]  Are these the normal numbers that you get?
[01:26:41.278 --> 01:26:46.641]  This is really good turnout for Wednesday, especially only having, what, a day and a half of planning, so I would say this is a great turnout.
[01:26:46.641 --> 01:26:47.081]  Yeah.
[01:26:47.081 --> 01:26:48.262]  Probably more people than I expected.
[01:26:48.262 --> 01:26:51.143]  You know, we have all kinds of media out here, Alex, as you pointed out.
[01:26:51.143 --> 01:26:53.825]  We've got at least four or five various news agencies.
[01:26:53.825 --> 01:26:55.726]  We've got people from New York down here.
[01:26:55.726 --> 01:26:57.527]  It's a great scene and I'm very happy to see.
[01:26:57.527 --> 01:26:58.728]  Now, we're outside in front of this
[01:26:59.268 --> 01:27:16.581]  Open carry friendly business and the guys were just inside maybe a few guys still left in there where this business happily accepts Open carriers, so you can come in here with your long gun with your rifle strapped to your back, and they will accept your business That's great And we do that in San Antonio tour where people put little American flags on their windows To let them know they're pro-second amendment now.
[01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:25.108]  It's spreading all over the country We all just have to identify with each other that we're part of the Liberty crew We're not divided on religion race all these other things
[01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:27.750]  There's people Alex, you know we have people of every race.
[01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:31.134]  We have men, we have women, just young, old.
[01:27:31.134 --> 01:27:33.756]  This guy right here, are you working?
[01:27:33.756 --> 01:27:38.401]  Oh yeah, I just got out of work, but it's only on lunch breaks for a short amount of time.
[01:27:38.401 --> 01:27:43.626]  This man was so concerned about his second minute race, he came out here on his lunch break after his come and take it hat.
[01:27:43.626 --> 01:27:45.008]  So what do you think about this crowd turnout?
[01:27:45.587 --> 01:27:46.748]  It looks pretty great.
[01:27:46.748 --> 01:27:48.909]  Everyone's fun and loving around here.
[01:27:48.909 --> 01:27:50.129]  There's no violence.
[01:27:50.129 --> 01:27:53.511]  Everyone's, you know, doing their time and, you know, taking it easy.
[01:27:53.511 --> 01:27:54.611]  It's all safe.
[01:27:54.611 --> 01:27:55.152]  Great job.
[01:27:55.152 --> 01:28:04.016]  Hey, Jakari, I want you to interview some of the South by Southwest folks, but those two FROI lines right back behind you, go talk to them.
[01:28:04.016 --> 01:28:05.937]  Let's go talk to those young ladies, get their take on this.
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:11.944]  So, I see you're out here, you're armed, so what do you think about ladies carrying firearms?
[01:28:11.944 --> 01:28:12.605]  I love it.
[01:28:12.605 --> 01:28:14.808]  Um, I think it's every woman's individual choice.
[01:28:14.808 --> 01:28:17.391]  If she wants to carry it, it's her right to do so.
[01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:18.992]  I think it's very safe.
[01:28:18.992 --> 01:28:19.533]  Very safe?
[01:28:19.533 --> 01:28:21.215]  I just love women with guns!
[01:28:21.215 --> 01:28:23.598]  I mean, I just, I want women to be empowered!
[01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:26.161]  We want women to be empowered, as you guys very much are.
[01:28:26.161 --> 01:28:27.742]  Tell us what you're carrying today.
[01:28:27.742 --> 01:28:28.443]  I'm carrying an AR-15.
[01:28:30.185 --> 01:28:31.606]  Um, this is an AK-47.
[01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:33.008]  It's actually a friend of mine.
[01:28:33.008 --> 01:28:33.728]  Let's take a look at this.
[01:28:33.728 --> 01:28:34.509]  It's beautiful.
[01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:34.930]  It's gorgeous.
[01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:37.553]  Let's take a look at this gorgeous weapon.
[01:28:37.553 --> 01:28:38.474]  This is gorgeous.
[01:28:38.474 --> 01:28:39.735]  I like... I want to put it together.
[01:28:39.735 --> 01:28:40.776]  I'll put it together, okay?
[01:28:40.776 --> 01:28:41.236]  Yeah.
[01:28:41.236 --> 01:28:42.838]  We're gonna, we're gonna do... It's gorgeous.
[01:28:42.838 --> 01:28:45.221]  But Bloomberg says he has 15 bodyguards.
[01:28:45.641 --> 01:28:52.404]  Yeah, you know, so you guys see all these people out here, but a lot of these politicians who want to take your gun rights away, they have bodyguards at their arm.
[01:28:52.404 --> 01:28:56.686]  You know, Mayor Bloomberg, you know, he has 15 bodyguards, but he doesn't want you guys to be able to be armed.
[01:28:56.686 --> 01:28:58.227]  Yeah, talk to the lady in the polka dot dress.
[01:28:58.227 --> 01:28:59.867]  I mean, that's, that's, the feminists don't like that.
[01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:00.728]  That's traditional.
[01:29:00.728 --> 01:29:05.070]  So let me ask you, you know, because they, they want women to be disarmed.
[01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:07.171]  If something did happen, they want you to be able to call the police.
[01:29:07.171 --> 01:29:12.493]  Now we do have a police escort behind us, but what do you guys think about taking care of the situation yourself?
[01:29:12.493 --> 01:29:14.274]  I think it's our right and responsibility.
[01:29:14.625 --> 01:29:16.126]  Responsibility, that's a good word.
[01:29:16.126 --> 01:29:21.989]  You are responsible for your self-defense because when moments count, police are only moments, are only minutes away.
[01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:26.771]  I believe the saying goes now, of course we have our armed escort today, but it's not like this all the time.
[01:29:26.771 --> 01:29:34.315]  And if you do encounter some police, it may not be on the most friendly circumstance, but we do respect the Austin Police Department for abiding by the laws today.
[01:29:34.315 --> 01:29:37.637]  Absolutely, get those ladies to say Molon Labe.
[01:29:37.637 --> 01:29:39.678]  So can I get a Molon Labe cheer from you ladies?
[01:29:39.678 --> 01:29:41.099]  Alright, one, two, three.
[01:29:43.607 --> 01:29:47.393]  Yeah!
[01:29:47.393 --> 01:29:50.077]  We're going to break, Jakari!
[01:29:50.077 --> 01:29:51.480]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.004]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.004 --> 01:29:56.708]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.899 --> 01:30:04.223]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:30:04.223 --> 01:30:06.665]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:30:06.665 --> 01:30:15.254]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:30:15.254 --> 01:30:18.398]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others.
[01:30:18.618 --> 01:30:31.564]  We have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:30:31.564 --> 01:30:39.188]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:30:39.608 --> 01:30:45.931]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:30:45.931 --> 01:30:54.676]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[01:30:58.858 --> 01:30:59.698]  InfoWarsLife.com
[01:31:01.078 --> 01:31:06.866]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:31:06.866 --> 01:31:14.255]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:31:14.255 --> 01:31:17.619]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:31:17.619 --> 01:31:19.382]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:31:19.642 --> 01:31:24.285]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:31:24.285 --> 01:31:27.207]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:31:27.207 --> 01:31:33.171]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:31:33.171 --> 01:31:36.833]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:31:36.833 --> 01:31:42.077]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[01:31:42.077 --> 01:31:45.059]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:51.283]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:31:51.283 --> 01:31:53.444]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[01:31:53.444 --> 01:31:58.968]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:58.968 --> 01:32:00.329]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:01.169 --> 01:32:03.050]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:06.711]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:32:06.711 --> 01:32:11.252]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:32:11.252 --> 01:32:17.354]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:32:17.354 --> 01:32:28.137]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:32:28.357 --> 01:32:34.839]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:32:34.839 --> 01:32:52.143]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:32:52.143 --> 01:32:56.264]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filter today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:56.745 --> 01:32:56.945]  Call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:18.587 --> 01:33:25.136]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:25.136 --> 01:33:26.598]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:29.065 --> 01:33:40.797]  Joining us for the next half hour, and we'll go back to the live march for the Second Amendment at South by Southwest to cover a bunch of geopolitical news from Ukraine to the missing Malaysian flight and a lot of other breaking news.
[01:33:40.797 --> 01:33:43.640]  Looks like a gas main explosion there in Harlem.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:45.181]  Two dead, hundreds wounded.
[01:33:45.181 --> 01:33:46.943]  Sarah, prayers for those folks.
[01:33:46.943 --> 01:33:48.364]  Thank God it wasn't some type of terror attack.
[01:33:49.265 --> 01:33:54.410]  I remember back when Clinton was in office and the Monica Lewinsky thing was going on and Drudge was breaking that.
[01:33:54.410 --> 01:34:00.116]  There were all these other women he was settling with who said that he had bit them and slapped them around and raped them.
[01:34:00.116 --> 01:34:02.938]  Other women that said he had groped them, done all these different things.
[01:34:02.938 --> 01:34:05.701]  But most of them didn't have the courage to go public.
[01:34:05.701 --> 01:34:10.405]  Some people that had documented it got beaten up, got hurt, got their legs broken.
[01:34:10.405 --> 01:34:12.627]  That came out in different films like the Clinton Chronicles.
[01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:19.386]  But Target caught in the crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Kathleen Willey.
[01:34:19.386 --> 01:34:28.795]  She was a White House aide who in 1998 alleged on 60 Minutes that Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted her in 1993 during his first term as president.
[01:34:28.795 --> 01:34:35.380]  She had been subpoenaed to verify and testify in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case where he perjured himself, obviously.
[01:34:36.101 --> 01:34:42.546]  According to Willie, during a meeting in the private study of the Oval Offices, Clinton had basically jumped on her.
[01:34:42.546 --> 01:34:43.746]  And of course, she got away.
[01:34:43.746 --> 01:34:49.110]  It was still traumatic, but I mean, Clinton reportedly settled stuff that was vicious.
[01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:52.793]  And the issue is, we've seen Bill Maher and others come out and say, oh, don't touch that.
[01:34:52.793 --> 01:34:54.654]  That makes Hillary look like a victim.
[01:34:54.654 --> 01:34:56.075]  No, it doesn't.
[01:34:56.075 --> 01:34:59.858]  Hillary's a predator in a political marriage.
[01:34:59.858 --> 01:35:02.660]  And the whole issue is, we're sick of the Clintons.
[01:35:03.678 --> 01:35:12.283]  And she joins us now to talk about her experience with Eric Clinton and what it's like the deja vu of two Clinton terms, co-president Hillary.
[01:35:12.283 --> 01:35:15.345]  Now, Obama's like a third and fourth Clinton term.
[01:35:15.345 --> 01:35:22.969]  If Hillary runs and wins a fifth, sixth dynasty, I mean, why not have, I mean, Jeb Bush, I mean, they're talking about running.
[01:35:22.969 --> 01:35:25.051]  I mean, can we just get away from these two families?
[01:35:25.051 --> 01:35:26.592]  But with the Clintons, it's really bad.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.841]  Plus, she's been persecuted by them.
[01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:32.642]  What is it like to know that they just never get out of power?
[01:35:32.642 --> 01:35:34.923]  Kathleen, thanks for coming on.
[01:35:34.923 --> 01:35:35.683]  Oh, you're welcome.
[01:35:35.683 --> 01:35:36.644]  Glad to be here.
[01:35:36.644 --> 01:35:46.288]  Why don't you recap for folks that don't remember the lore of the 90s, all the things that happened, what you went through, other women, and then what it's like for you.
[01:35:46.288 --> 01:35:48.509]  Well, it's been an interesting journey.
[01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:54.652]  A lot of it didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but the reality of what happened to me is that
[01:35:56.570 --> 01:36:01.255]  During a family crisis, a financial crisis, I went to see the President.
[01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:06.780]  I was working there at that time, and I asked him for a job.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:09.823]  I was a volunteer at that point, and I just went to him as a friend.
[01:36:09.823 --> 01:36:11.044]  He was a friend of both of ours.
[01:36:11.044 --> 01:36:18.291]  We raised a lot of money for him, and I just said, I've got a crisis, and I need help, and I can't be a volunteer anymore.
[01:36:18.291 --> 01:36:20.974]  And he has the reputation of
[01:36:21.934 --> 01:36:26.297]  Uh, picking women who are vulnerable for what he's really good at.
[01:36:26.297 --> 01:36:27.778]  And I was, I was that day.
[01:36:27.778 --> 01:36:28.959]  I was upset.
[01:36:28.959 --> 01:36:29.840]  I was crying.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.782]  You know, I couldn't get answers from anybody.
[01:36:32.782 --> 01:36:36.164]  And that's when he, you know, that's when he jumped on me.
[01:36:36.164 --> 01:36:39.907]  And it got pretty, it got, well, let's just say I was surprised.
[01:36:40.672 --> 01:36:45.476]  And it was unwelcome, and I really don't want to go into all the details of it.
[01:36:45.476 --> 01:36:46.257]  It's in my book.
[01:36:46.257 --> 01:36:46.997]  I've told it a lot.
[01:36:46.997 --> 01:36:53.923]  But anyway, when I got home, I found that my husband had taken his own life that day because of this crisis.
[01:36:53.923 --> 01:36:57.546]  So, you know, it's been a long, long journey here.
[01:36:58.226 --> 01:37:07.755]  But the thing that bothers me about all this, and the reason that I came out here recently, is because Hillary Clinton is going to run on women's issues.
[01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:08.716]  That's it right there.
[01:37:08.716 --> 01:37:11.498]  It's going to be all about women.
[01:37:11.498 --> 01:37:19.225]  And the supposed bogus war on women charge of the Republicans.
[01:37:19.225 --> 01:37:22.608]  And all I can say is Hillary Clinton is the war on women.
[01:37:23.072 --> 01:37:29.203]  Because what she's done over all these years is enable his behavior and it never stops.
[01:37:29.203 --> 01:37:33.371]  She never insisted that they get counseling or any of it.
[01:37:33.371 --> 01:37:34.513]  She just put up with it.
[01:37:35.362 --> 01:37:42.806]  And basically, the way she handled it was to go after the women who happened to cross paths with him.
[01:37:42.806 --> 01:37:46.408]  Mostly innocent women in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[01:37:46.408 --> 01:37:47.329]  And it was serious.
[01:37:47.329 --> 01:37:48.429]  And we're not all lying.
[01:37:48.429 --> 01:37:49.750]  It's all the same thing.
[01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:51.511]  We were terrified.
[01:37:51.511 --> 01:38:00.616]  And I just don't see how she can claim to be a woman's advocate when she's doing what she's doing here.
[01:38:00.616 --> 01:38:02.037]  And it continues.
[01:38:02.037 --> 01:38:03.278]  She goes after the women.
[01:38:04.401 --> 01:38:18.420]  And I just think a lot of young people now who really don't remember that, it's that far, you know, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, who just think that it would really be cool to vote for the first woman president.
[01:38:19.361 --> 01:38:20.682]  And they don't know the issues.
[01:38:20.682 --> 01:38:22.403]  They want to know the issues.
[01:38:22.403 --> 01:38:26.666]  They just want to go into the voting booth and push yes.
[01:38:50.302 --> 01:38:57.385]  And we're backing Bill Clinton up and saying what a great guy he is.
[01:38:57.385 --> 01:39:06.010]  And now Senator Rand Paul has come out about your case and others, and of course your book, Target, caught in the crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton, available at worldnetdaily.com.
[01:39:06.010 --> 01:39:12.454]  Excellent book to give to women to show them that the Democratic Party establishment, so-called feminism,
[01:39:15.356 --> 01:39:21.140]  Under the Clintons is a certified fraud in my view, and it's just so disgusting.
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:33.350]  What do you make of Rand Paul saying, hey, you know, Bill Clinton has no right to be out raising money for the Democrats as their biggest earner, and it's shameful that no one will call him on this from the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.
[01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:34.731]  What do you have to say about Senator Rand Paul?
[01:39:36.536 --> 01:39:38.477]  I don't think it was out of bounds at all.
[01:39:38.477 --> 01:39:45.380]  What the Democrats and some of the women's groups are trying to do is basically, people like us are being attacked.
[01:39:50.611 --> 01:39:55.214]  All I'm saying is that Rand Paul, I think he had the right to ask that question.
[01:39:55.214 --> 01:40:02.079]  It's not about, anymore, it's not about these other issues, about what has happened to these women.
[01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:10.605]  It's about Hillary putting in place all of these terror campaigns for these women to get rid of them.
[01:40:10.605 --> 01:40:11.485]  That's what it's about.
[01:40:11.485 --> 01:40:14.547]  I don't want to dredge up all of that sordid stuff.
[01:40:14.547 --> 01:40:15.548]  Nobody does.
[01:40:15.548 --> 01:40:17.950]  But we need to, we need to, because he's settled cases.
[01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:24.554]  Where, you know, he gets the women, starts choking them, bites them like a pit bull to hold them down while he rapes them.
[01:40:24.554 --> 01:40:28.236]  I mean, I guess you got away before he got to that.
[01:40:28.236 --> 01:40:28.616]  Pardon me?
[01:40:28.616 --> 01:40:30.037]  If he said, she said.
[01:40:30.037 --> 01:40:32.838]  But I can tell you right now, we're all telling the truth.
[01:40:32.838 --> 01:40:34.720]  Especially Juanita Broderick.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.321]  She's a friend of mine.
[01:40:36.321 --> 01:40:38.302]  She told me the story, what he did to her.
[01:40:38.302 --> 01:40:39.723]  And let me tell you something.
[01:40:39.723 --> 01:40:40.283]  This woman,
[01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:42.343]  It's not lying.
[01:40:42.343 --> 01:40:47.309]  And I have a lot of admiration for her for finally going on and telling her story.
[01:40:47.309 --> 01:40:48.751]  And nobody blinks.
[01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:54.217]  And the women's groups, well, the only good thing that came out of that is that we doubted them.
[01:40:54.217 --> 01:40:57.622]  They're about one thing and one thing only, and that's abortion.
[01:40:57.622 --> 01:40:58.323]  Where are they now?
[01:40:59.462 --> 01:41:01.423]  Well, look at it this way.
[01:41:01.423 --> 01:41:11.188]  What was happening to me all that time, and I should have been able to go to Women Now, all the feminist groups and all, and ask for help.
[01:41:11.188 --> 01:41:16.531]  Because, you know, what they were doing to me on that one issue.
[01:41:16.531 --> 01:41:18.011]  But they were nowhere to be found.
[01:41:18.011 --> 01:41:18.612]  They still aren't.
[01:41:19.366 --> 01:41:21.108]  You can't find them anywhere.
[01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:27.614]  And, like I said, feminism right now is about one single thing and that's abortion.
[01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:28.095]  That's it.
[01:41:28.095 --> 01:41:28.876]  Period.
[01:41:28.876 --> 01:41:32.179]  It's just not useful anymore.
[01:41:32.179 --> 01:41:32.860]  It's just not.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:33.700]  Well, that's it.
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.303]  It's all population reduction and that's the Democratic Party.
[01:41:36.303 --> 01:41:37.004]  Yes, it is.
[01:41:37.004 --> 01:41:37.744]  I know, it is.
[01:41:40.703 --> 01:41:44.125]  I just don't see how that can not be an issue here.
[01:41:44.125 --> 01:41:49.348]  Because they're all going to try to say, think like I said before, we don't need to drag all that stuff, all that story.
[01:41:49.348 --> 01:41:50.949]  I agree.
[01:41:50.949 --> 01:41:52.130]  But you know what?
[01:41:52.130 --> 01:41:55.792]  They're the ones who keep bringing up.
[01:41:55.792 --> 01:41:57.193]  They need to go away.
[01:41:57.193 --> 01:42:02.816]  Because they're the ones, because they insist on being on the public stage here.
[01:42:02.816 --> 01:42:05.558]  Every day, you're going to always hear something.
[01:42:06.438 --> 01:42:07.319]  We're good to go.
[01:42:19.741 --> 01:42:22.783]  People just need to understand what this woman's about.
[01:42:22.783 --> 01:42:24.384]  They need to read about her.
[01:42:24.384 --> 01:42:24.584]  Sure.
[01:42:24.584 --> 01:42:25.964]  They need to listen to the stories.
[01:42:25.964 --> 01:42:32.028]  Sure, I would vote for a woman, and have voted for women, that are pro-Constitution, pro-Bill of Rights, that are libertarian.
[01:42:32.028 --> 01:42:33.168]  I don't care about political party.
[01:42:33.168 --> 01:42:40.012]  If they're pro-freedom and I think that they want justice and that they're people that aren't crooks, I would support a woman, a man, a black person, a white person.
[01:42:40.012 --> 01:42:40.633]  I don't care.
[01:42:40.633 --> 01:42:44.195]  It's about the content of their minds, their deeds, as Martin Luther King said.
[01:42:44.975 --> 01:42:53.199]  Under Obama, you can't criticize any of his corruption, any of the bad stuff he's done, all the scams they've run, Obamacare, the lying, because he's black.
[01:42:53.199 --> 01:42:57.341]  And they say, well, you know, his approval rating's down because of racist.
[01:42:57.341 --> 01:42:58.202]  And it's the same thing.
[01:42:58.202 --> 01:43:02.444]  Imagine if Hillary gets in, if you criticize anything she's doing,
[01:43:03.584 --> 01:43:04.485]  You're against women.
[01:43:04.485 --> 01:43:07.226]  It's this mindless gang mentality.
[01:43:07.226 --> 01:43:15.671]  And I think if she runs again, you know, you're going to have a lot of women line up from her, and it'll go from the gimmick of the black president, the gimmick to the woman president.
[01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:25.737]  Do we really want the first female American president to be Hillary Clinton with Cattlegate, futures, and all the murders, and Vince Foster, and all her girlfriends, and
[01:43:26.357 --> 01:43:31.181]  I mean, maybe she'll divorce Clinton, she'll have a first lady with the lady president.
[01:43:31.181 --> 01:43:32.442]  Maybe that'll be the gimmick.
[01:43:32.442 --> 01:43:38.427]  She can have gulags for gun owners, but she'll be kissing her wife on television, so it'll be okay.
[01:43:38.427 --> 01:43:41.909]  I don't want to get graphic here, but we know all her girlfriends.
[01:43:41.909 --> 01:43:44.511]  Good point.
[01:43:44.511 --> 01:43:45.372]  That's one of the reasons.
[01:43:45.372 --> 01:43:49.035]  There are plenty of women out there who are more qualified.
[01:43:49.035 --> 01:43:52.017]  Frankly, can you tell me anything that Hillary's done?
[01:43:53.178 --> 01:43:58.000]  Having a really good way of riding the men's coattails to get to where she wants to get?
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.361]  What has she done?
[01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:01.302]  What has she done that makes her deserve to be in charge?
[01:44:01.302 --> 01:44:04.263]  Well, she got thrown off the Watergate Commission for producing fake documents.
[01:44:04.263 --> 01:44:06.605]  I mean, she's a criminal!
[01:44:06.605 --> 01:44:08.786]  And let's go back to Benghazi, okay?
[01:44:08.786 --> 01:44:10.086]  That doesn't make a difference here?
[01:44:10.086 --> 01:44:12.307]  I mean, all of these things.
[01:44:12.307 --> 01:44:18.270]  I mean, she does not, we do not, we don't deserve her as a president.
[01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:20.911]  I mean, she's an absolute gangster!
[01:44:20.911 --> 01:44:22.032]  And I'm sick of looking at her!
[01:44:23.697 --> 01:44:24.698]  That's my point.
[01:44:24.698 --> 01:44:31.221]  Well, she was the first one, way back when, you know, two for the price of one, and the co-president.
[01:44:31.221 --> 01:44:32.542]  Well, you know what?
[01:44:32.542 --> 01:44:36.004]  She kind of got the co-presidency down.
[01:44:36.004 --> 01:44:38.365]  It's time for these people just to go away.
[01:44:39.466 --> 01:44:51.140]  For the country's sake, just go out with a little bit of honor instead of dredging up all of these things that are going to be dredged up every single day when she runs and when she's in office.
[01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:52.261]  Give us a break.
[01:44:52.261 --> 01:44:53.342]  Just be honorable.
[01:44:53.342 --> 01:44:54.203]  Do the right thing.
[01:44:54.924 --> 01:45:04.851]  Retire, you know, book a couple of appointment speeches, you know, a couple times a year so they get their egos all, you know, taken care of.
[01:45:04.851 --> 01:45:09.074]  And just go, be senior statesmen for that matter.
[01:45:09.074 --> 01:45:10.895]  And let's just put it to rest.
[01:45:10.895 --> 01:45:16.299]  You had your turn, you screwed up, we're sick of assorted stories, because that's all we're going to hear.
[01:45:16.299 --> 01:45:16.919]  That's right.
[01:45:16.919 --> 01:45:18.260]  That's all we're going to hear.
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:21.803]  And they're the ones who just won't exit stage left.
[01:45:21.803 --> 01:45:22.143]  That's it.
[01:45:22.691 --> 01:45:23.311]  That's right.
[01:45:23.311 --> 01:45:25.692]  And with all this baggage, it's time for the Clintons to go.
[01:45:25.692 --> 01:45:30.874]  And look, I don't romanticize the Republican Party, but the real Liberty Tea Party movement is real.
[01:45:30.874 --> 01:45:32.514]  Both political parties are scared of it.
[01:45:32.514 --> 01:45:35.195]  They're winning races and primaries everywhere.
[01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:35.715]  It begins.
[01:45:35.715 --> 01:45:37.996]  GOP wins Florida congressional seat.
[01:45:37.996 --> 01:45:40.236]  First place Obamacare was implemented.
[01:45:40.236 --> 01:45:42.137]  Clinton's push doesn't save.
[01:45:42.137 --> 01:45:43.397]  Flashback race.
[01:45:43.397 --> 01:45:44.858]  Dems can't afford to lose.
[01:45:44.858 --> 01:45:46.298]  Axelrod explains.
[01:45:46.298 --> 01:45:47.859]  That's all up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:45:48.899 --> 01:45:54.184]  It is all over the place, the backlash against the Democrats right now.
[01:45:54.184 --> 01:45:59.489]  And the Democrats should be running from the Clintons and running from Obama.
[01:45:59.489 --> 01:46:09.217]  But I guess they think electronic voting machines and illegal aliens voting are going to save them as they hand out driver's licenses coast to coast so people can vote illegally.
[01:46:09.217 --> 01:46:10.218]  But I just don't see that happening.
[01:46:10.218 --> 01:46:11.720]  We need a balance of power.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.841]  We don't need one political party running everything.
[01:46:14.642 --> 01:46:26.726]  And I think 2014 is the year, unless Obama starts a war or some distraction, that we could see the Republicans sweep the House and the Senate and a bunch of governorships and state houses.
[01:46:26.726 --> 01:46:35.990]  And then if the Tea Party keeps the pressure on them, we could cut taxes, reverse a bunch of the tyranny, cut the defense spending, cut the welfare, get out of some of the derivatives.
[01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:39.391]  Because if they don't right the ship, Wall Street needs to even know this.
[01:46:39.391 --> 01:46:41.152]  They're going to wreck the Golden Goose.
[01:46:41.992 --> 01:46:49.799]  Cloward and Piven run this country over an edge of a cliff, which is what the kleptocratic, hardcore collectivists want.
[01:46:49.799 --> 01:46:58.466]  And I mean, does the establishment really want to wreck the empire just so they can settle their scores with veterans and gun owners?
[01:46:59.287 --> 01:47:04.912]  So a bunch of leftists that fill up the New World Order can have their way with their political enemies.
[01:47:04.912 --> 01:47:06.874]  I mean, and that's really what's going on here.
[01:47:06.874 --> 01:47:13.780]  And that's why there's a good chance we can beat them, because even the establishment doesn't like what's going on, large sections of it.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:24.989]  And if the establishment, who's not purely kleptocratic, I know, will ally itself with the grassroots and populism, we could fire this country up and reverse what's happening.
[01:47:24.989 --> 01:47:26.651]  And it starts with destroying the Clintons.
[01:47:28.414 --> 01:47:29.254]  And it starts now.
[01:47:29.254 --> 01:47:31.055]  Right now.
[01:47:31.055 --> 01:47:33.075]  I agree with you 100%.
[01:47:33.075 --> 01:47:35.196]  And it needs to be done right.
[01:47:35.196 --> 01:47:41.678]  Just don't cave to these threats of, you know, being called a sexist.
[01:47:41.678 --> 01:47:43.418]  I was called that last week.
[01:47:43.418 --> 01:47:46.979]  I was called a misogynist sexist.
[01:47:46.979 --> 01:47:49.500]  You're against women because you don't worship Hillary?
[01:47:50.563 --> 01:47:51.623]  Exactly right.
[01:47:51.623 --> 01:47:53.684]  You know, look what she said about Monica.
[01:47:53.684 --> 01:47:57.565]  She's a narcissistic looney toon.
[01:47:57.565 --> 01:47:58.105]  That one.
[01:47:58.105 --> 01:48:02.086]  How would she like it if somebody said that about Chelsea, okay?
[01:48:02.086 --> 01:48:09.727]  If she got in this predicament that's going on now, how would she like it if somebody out there called Hillary those kinds of names?
[01:48:09.727 --> 01:48:11.828]  I mean, that's the point.
[01:48:13.801 --> 01:48:14.881]  They have no honor.
[01:48:14.881 --> 01:48:15.141]  That's all.
[01:48:15.141 --> 01:48:15.982]  It's just that simple.
[01:48:15.982 --> 01:48:17.682]  Did you see today's news?
[01:48:17.682 --> 01:48:21.123]  Who Clinton's going to be out campaigning for now?
[01:48:21.123 --> 01:48:24.483]  Well, remember her saying in Benghazi, what difference does it make?
[01:48:24.483 --> 01:48:25.984]  What difference does it make?
[01:48:25.984 --> 01:48:28.104]  I mean, the arrogance of this person.
[01:48:28.104 --> 01:48:29.084]  She's detestable.
[01:48:29.084 --> 01:48:30.825]  I'll tell you what difference it makes.
[01:48:30.825 --> 01:48:32.065]  We don't need them anymore.
[01:48:32.065 --> 01:48:33.285]  We don't want them anymore.
[01:48:33.285 --> 01:48:35.186]  They just need to go away.
[01:48:35.186 --> 01:48:35.566]  That's all.
[01:48:37.093 --> 01:48:42.539]  You know, if they love this country and they want to make this country better, the best they can do is just get out.
[01:48:42.539 --> 01:48:49.247]  Because we're sick of hearing all the stories, you know, is he still fooling around and, you know, is she or isn't she?
[01:48:49.247 --> 01:48:50.748]  All of it, you know, just go away.
[01:48:50.748 --> 01:48:55.454]  Just briefly, I mean, I know it's in the book and people should get the book and read it.
[01:48:56.957 --> 01:49:07.176]  And we're going to play this Hillary Clinton video here in a moment, but first off, and again we're talking to the author of Target Caught in the Crosshairs, the bill of Hillary Clinton, Kathleen Wiley.
[01:49:09.191 --> 01:49:14.736]  Willie, I'm trying to understand here, because I remember all these stories and him settling the cases.
[01:49:14.736 --> 01:49:17.898]  I mean, tell folks what some of these women told you Bill Clinton does to them.
[01:49:17.898 --> 01:49:21.341]  I know you don't like to bring this stuff up because it sounds really horrible and there's kids listening.
[01:49:21.341 --> 01:49:23.202]  Women who he knows he can take advantage of.
[01:49:23.202 --> 01:49:24.523]  I mean, he's a predator.
[01:49:24.523 --> 01:49:25.444]  He's good at what he does.
[01:49:25.444 --> 01:49:27.205]  He's good at sizing these women up.
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:33.582]  That's his shtick.
[01:49:33.582 --> 01:49:35.484]  That's what he does.
[01:49:35.484 --> 01:49:42.633]  And his idea is to just get whatever he wants from them because nobody's going to believe them if they try to tell this story.
[01:49:42.633 --> 01:49:44.535]  That's exactly what he does.
[01:49:44.535 --> 01:49:45.476]  And it's the same thing.
[01:49:45.476 --> 01:49:48.841]  It's just sexual harassment.
[01:49:49.982 --> 01:49:53.484]  And the same thing happened, we're not all lying.
[01:49:53.484 --> 01:49:58.728]  I mean, our homes were broken into, my animals went missing, my car was vandalized.
[01:49:58.728 --> 01:50:03.631]  I mean, all these kinds of things that she was orchestrating.
[01:50:03.631 --> 01:50:06.133]  Now let's give Hillary some fair time.
[01:50:06.133 --> 01:50:08.034]  FCC rules, fairness doctrine.
[01:50:08.034 --> 01:50:09.215]  Let's hear from her for a moment.
[01:50:09.215 --> 01:50:10.096]  This is how she counters.
[01:50:10.516 --> 01:50:10.777]  Okay.
[01:50:27.739 --> 01:50:28.680]  She's been covering it up.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:29.180]  We know.
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:32.723]  They sent those guys over there to do a fake kidnapping.
[01:50:32.723 --> 01:50:37.727]  It was the Benghazi security by the State Department, Al Qaeda funded, and Navy SEALs fired back on them.
[01:50:37.727 --> 01:50:41.429]  So they went ahead and threw a fit and killed everybody and then got all the missiles that were in the warehouse.
[01:50:42.267 --> 01:50:46.012]  They wanted to act like that the missiles just got into their hands by accident.
[01:50:46.012 --> 01:50:50.238]  But then when people fought back who didn't get the script, they had to kill everybody.
[01:50:50.238 --> 01:50:53.482]  That's what happened, and that's why you ordered an eight-hour stand-down, witch.
[01:50:53.482 --> 01:50:54.644]  You killed those people.
[01:50:54.644 --> 01:50:56.226]  You murdered them, Hillary.
[01:50:56.226 --> 01:50:58.469]  Kathleen Willey, stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:50:58.469 --> 01:50:59.510]  Hillary Clinton murdered Hillary.
[01:51:02.239 --> 01:51:03.739]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[01:51:03.739 --> 01:51:06.580]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:11.422]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[01:51:11.422 --> 01:51:16.763]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.

[01:51:31.104 --> 01:51:33.906]  Did you know that gold and silver contain healing properties?
[01:51:33.906 --> 01:51:34.527]  It's true.
[01:51:34.527 --> 01:51:41.232]  Since the beginning of mankind's history, gold and silver have not only been used as real money, but also for healing our minds and bodies.

[01:51:57.604 --> 01:52:00.467]  Fighting for liberty and healing one American at a time.
[01:52:01.328 --> 01:52:02.329]  Hi there.
[01:52:02.329 --> 01:52:03.850]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:07.672]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:52:07.672 --> 01:52:16.818]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:52:16.818 --> 01:52:23.543]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:52:23.543 --> 01:52:25.724]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:52:25.724 --> 01:52:30.808]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:52:31.528 --> 01:52:39.475]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:52:39.475 --> 01:52:45.059]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:52:45.059 --> 01:52:51.564]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:57.289]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:52:57.289 --> 01:52:58.430]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:03.112]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:53:03.112 --> 01:53:08.256]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:53:08.256 --> 01:53:16.381]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:53:16.381 --> 01:53:20.904]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:53:20.904 --> 01:53:24.727]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:53:24.867 --> 01:53:30.812]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:53:30.812 --> 01:53:33.975]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:53:33.975 --> 01:53:39.359]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:53:39.359 --> 01:53:47.546]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:53:47.546 --> 01:53:47.726]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:53:54.051 --> 01:53:56.693]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:53:56.693 --> 01:54:07.482]  BuyPatriotSupply.com Slash Alex.
[01:54:07.482 --> 01:54:19.392]  On a lonely, lonesome highway East of Omaha
[01:54:35.791 --> 01:54:42.537]  More and more, there's an article about a feminist professor attacking a pro-life student.
[01:54:42.537 --> 01:54:46.161]  More and more, they're calling to shut down free speech, Bloomberg and others.
[01:54:47.208 --> 01:54:50.951]  Well, you can't even promote the Second Amendment because they're losing the fight, folks.
[01:54:50.951 --> 01:54:56.034]  People now know the so-called left is an authoritarian group.
[01:54:56.034 --> 01:54:59.076]  And the Republicans, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[01:54:59.076 --> 01:55:01.218]  They can be authoritarian as well.
[01:55:01.218 --> 01:55:05.480]  The difference is they are making their move right now.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:07.382]  The globalists are moving on every front.
[01:55:07.382 --> 01:55:10.504]  And just giving her some final comments, I appreciate her courage.
[01:55:10.504 --> 01:55:12.045]  I think I interviewed her back at the time.
[01:55:12.045 --> 01:55:13.406]  I interviewed a lot of the women involved.
[01:55:15.422 --> 01:55:18.543]  I know I interviewed Kathleen Willey way back at the time.
[01:55:18.543 --> 01:55:21.605]  Her book, Target Caught in the Crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[01:55:21.605 --> 01:55:22.606]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:55:22.606 --> 01:55:29.570]  Within a few minutes left, we've got here other points you'd like to make about the nightmare that has been the Clintons.
[01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:33.832]  I just think that we need to keep these kinds of stories alive.
[01:55:33.832 --> 01:55:37.895]  She's going to stop running when she stops breathing.
[01:55:37.895 --> 01:55:40.076]  I don't think there's any question whatsoever here.
[01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:45.214]  She's just running pestilence here with all of the latest things about her health and all that.
[01:55:45.214 --> 01:55:47.436]  That's exactly what's going on.
[01:55:47.436 --> 01:55:48.376]  She's going to run.
[01:55:48.376 --> 01:55:50.578]  I can't think of anything that's going to stop her.
[01:55:50.578 --> 01:55:51.739]  I just can't.
[01:55:51.739 --> 01:55:56.602]  And that's a shame because we just can't get, we can't blast these people out of office here.
[01:55:56.602 --> 01:55:57.423]  You know what?
[01:55:57.423 --> 01:55:59.544]  Just go away, have your turn.
[01:55:59.544 --> 01:56:01.085]  Let's see somebody new here.
[01:56:01.085 --> 01:56:03.767]  Let's see somebody who has different ideas here.
[01:56:03.767 --> 01:56:05.809]  It's just, you know, here comes another Quentin.
[01:56:07.085 --> 01:56:26.001]  And did you see in today's news that Bill Clinton is going to campaign for Chelsea's mother-in-law, whose father, her husband's father, was put in jail for stealing $10 million of investors' money.
[01:56:26.001 --> 01:56:28.844]  And now he's going to campaign for his wife.
[01:56:29.721 --> 01:56:31.862]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:56:31.862 --> 01:56:32.882]  They won't go away.
[01:56:32.882 --> 01:56:38.625]  Every time they get into any kind of a campaign endorsing, all these stories come up again.
[01:56:38.625 --> 01:56:40.626]  I'm not keeping the stories alive.
[01:56:40.626 --> 01:56:41.646]  They are.
[01:56:41.646 --> 01:56:43.587]  They thrive on controversy.
[01:56:43.587 --> 01:56:44.548]  Thrive on it.
[01:56:44.548 --> 01:56:45.468]  And chaos.
[01:56:45.468 --> 01:56:46.709]  They're the ones who are doing it.
[01:56:47.952 --> 01:56:51.615]  Like I said, do this country a favor, and just go away.
[01:56:51.615 --> 01:56:57.859]  Hold your head up, tell everybody that you'll be the best president ever, co-president, and just move on.
[01:56:57.859 --> 01:57:16.333]  Well, I mean, it is like Groundhog Day, and I am sick and tired of it, and again, they know where all the bodies are buried, they're blackmailing people, it's all on record, and they're just absolutely vicious, dangerous people, who I believe, the evidence is overwhelming, carried out of Oklahoma City, demonize their political opposition as well.
[01:57:16.333 --> 01:57:17.074]  The book's Target?
[01:57:17.881 --> 01:57:27.358]  Kathleen Willey, thank you so much and we'll hopefully talk to you again in the future when we have the political obituary on the political life of the Clinton crime family.
[01:57:27.358 --> 01:57:27.960]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:28.823 --> 01:57:29.543]  You're welcome.
[01:57:29.543 --> 01:57:30.504]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:57:30.504 --> 01:57:30.884]  Thank you.
[01:57:30.884 --> 01:57:31.904]  Wow.
[01:57:31.904 --> 01:57:35.866]  Next hour, they're down on 6th Street, the main trendy command base.
[01:57:35.866 --> 01:57:49.170]  We're going to be talking to the 100-plus Texans that have now marched, or marching, for the Second Amendment against Herr Bloomberg so that we can recapture the media attention and point out what's going on and expose the agenda.
[01:57:49.170 --> 01:57:53.372]  So we're going to get an update from Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, and then
[01:57:54.412 --> 01:57:55.494]  Bill Clinton doesn't look too good.
[01:57:55.494 --> 01:57:59.422]  He may actually not just politically be a dead duck, but he might not be around.
[01:57:59.422 --> 01:58:01.786]  They kept Dick Cheney alive, so who knows?
[01:58:01.786 --> 01:58:03.870]  They might be able to do anything.
[01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:06.455]  We've got a bunch of other news coming up as well.
[01:58:07.671 --> 01:58:11.112]  Briefly, I haven't plugged anything in two hours here today.
[01:58:11.112 --> 01:58:17.295]  We have a great InfowarStore.com with the ProPure gravity-fed filters that cut out the fluoride, the glyphosate, blows away all the competition.
[01:58:17.295 --> 01:58:20.856]  Look at the side-by-side comparisons of the ProPure Pro1 systems.
[01:58:20.856 --> 01:58:26.318]  We have the widest selection, biggest dealer in the world of them, because we have the lowest prices, 10% off promo code WATER.
[01:58:26.318 --> 01:58:28.999]  InfowarStore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:58:28.999 --> 01:58:31.060]  Drink purified, clean water and support the Infowar.
[01:58:34.821 --> 01:58:43.468]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:43.468 --> 01:58:47.451]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.854 --> 01:58:51.895]  The facts are in.
[01:58:51.895 --> 01:58:53.296]  The studies are legion.
[01:58:53.296 --> 01:59:00.800]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:04.623]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:59:04.623 --> 01:59:05.203]  Simple.
[01:59:05.203 --> 01:59:09.926]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:59:09.926 --> 01:59:13.148]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[01:59:13.328 --> 01:59:15.631]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:59:15.631 --> 01:59:21.177]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:59:21.177 --> 01:59:31.649]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:59:31.969 --> 01:59:36.532]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:59:36.532 --> 01:59:38.693]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:59:38.693 --> 01:59:44.256]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:59:44.256 --> 01:59:48.659]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:59:48.659 --> 01:59:53.902]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:53.902 --> 01:59:56.283]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.283 --> 01:59:59.065]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:10.575]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.575 --> 02:00:12.156]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.156 --> 02:00:13.698]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.698 --> 02:00:17.901]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.901 --> 02:00:21.965]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.986 --> 02:00:30.986]  You gotta love it!
[02:00:30.986 --> 02:00:33.387]  Radio listeners, I'll be giving you a play-by-play here.
[02:00:33.387 --> 02:00:38.449]  We've got live feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show, or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:38.449 --> 02:00:46.311]  And we've got, I don't know, a hundred or more people down there marching in South by Southwest, the big multimedia conference, one of the biggest in the world, that is funded by the World Bank.
[02:00:46.311 --> 02:00:48.752]  Seriously, go to their website, it's the main underwriter.
[02:00:48.752 --> 02:00:53.073]  And Bloomberg, and the whole thing's anti-gun, police state, anti-free speech.
[02:00:53.073 --> 02:00:58.375]  So we're down there talking to the trendies, and we're going to continue to talk to Jakari and Liam for another 20 minutes.
[02:00:59.275 --> 02:01:00.295]  But hey, it's not too late.
[02:01:00.295 --> 02:01:04.337]  You can march on Saturday at 1130 San Jacinto down Congress.
[02:01:04.337 --> 02:01:05.518]  That's going to be even bigger.
[02:01:05.518 --> 02:01:07.738]  This is how we fight back against the tyranny.
[02:01:07.738 --> 02:01:12.880]  Jakari, we haven't talked to you in 30 minutes while we were interviewing Kathleen Willey.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.882]  Give me your take on what's happened since then, Jakari.
[02:01:16.882 --> 02:01:22.344]  Give us a report, Jakari.
[02:01:26.257 --> 02:01:26.998]  See, we heard that.
[02:01:26.998 --> 02:01:30.823]  This is Houston to Cape Canaveral to...
[02:01:33.581 --> 02:01:35.242]  Yes, Sha'Carri, can you hear me?
[02:01:35.242 --> 02:01:36.422]  Okay, so we're out here.
[02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:37.763]  We've moved down to 6th Street.
[02:01:37.763 --> 02:01:40.424]  We'll go to the Convention Center here in a few minutes.
[02:01:40.424 --> 02:01:42.425]  You can see all these patriots out here.
[02:01:42.425 --> 02:01:48.748]  Justin, Cargill, all the normal names you know in the state of Texas for your open carry rights, for your gun rights, your Second Amendment rights.
[02:01:48.748 --> 02:01:49.449]  We got some great people.
[02:01:49.449 --> 02:01:50.389]  Let's talk to some people.
[02:01:50.389 --> 02:01:51.390]  Texas George!
[02:01:51.390 --> 02:01:52.010]  Texas George!
[02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:53.471]  You guys know Texas George.
[02:01:53.471 --> 02:01:57.232]  He was there the day Mike Martinez said he wanted to make the gun ban legitimate.
[02:01:57.232 --> 02:02:02.715]  Come on up here, Texas George, and tell us, what do you think about this rally today and what spurred you to come out here in the first place?
[02:02:02.955 --> 02:02:11.398]  Well, I'll tell you what, I just love seeing all the people out here this wonderful day in Austin, Texas, supporting the Second Amendment.
[02:02:11.398 --> 02:02:16.039]  The Second Amendment is actually, in my opinion, is number one of the amendments.
[02:02:16.039 --> 02:02:18.140]  If you lose that, you lose all the rest of them.
[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:23.862]  That's the one that gives you the ability and the strength to support and keep your other amendments.
[02:02:24.042 --> 02:02:24.402]  That's right.
[02:02:24.402 --> 02:02:29.787]  Now Texas, George, let me ask you, because you were the guy that Mike Martinez, the Austin City Council member, pointed out.
[02:02:29.787 --> 02:02:34.810]  He said, sir, you're out here with your sign, you're out here begging for attention, and we're going to make your sign legitimate shortly.
[02:02:34.810 --> 02:02:36.272]  What were your thoughts about that?
[02:02:36.272 --> 02:02:41.496]  Well, you know, their whole deal there that they were trying to do fell flat.
[02:02:41.496 --> 02:02:44.538]  And I'd just like to say to Mike, how do you like me now, Mike?
[02:02:45.274 --> 02:02:49.055]  Because that deal did not fly that they were trying to do.
[02:02:49.055 --> 02:02:54.436]  And I don't think the good people of Texas will ever allow guns to be restricted.
[02:02:54.436 --> 02:02:59.737]  All it takes for a bad guy to be stopped is a good guy with a gun.
[02:02:59.737 --> 02:03:00.357]  That's right.
[02:03:00.357 --> 02:03:01.397]  Thank you, Texas George.
[02:03:01.397 --> 02:03:02.677]  Hey, it's my pleasure.
[02:03:02.677 --> 02:03:03.697]  My pleasure.
[02:03:03.697 --> 02:03:05.458]  And that's what's going on out here.
[02:03:05.458 --> 02:03:12.359]  By the way, Jakari, Texas George, I've been seeing Texas George for 20 years before I was even on air at gun rallies.
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:13.802]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:03:13.802 --> 02:03:15.246]  You know, we've seen him several times.
[02:03:15.246 --> 02:03:18.916]  He was there at the Alamo, as well as many other of these people, these great patients.
[02:03:18.916 --> 02:03:19.538]  Let's talk to this guy.
[02:03:19.538 --> 02:03:20.521]  He's out here with his son.
[02:03:20.521 --> 02:03:20.661]  Sir!
[02:03:21.286 --> 02:03:22.667]  You might have given us a word.
[02:03:22.667 --> 02:03:24.328]  So you came out here with your son.
[02:03:24.328 --> 02:03:26.109]  Is this a school day or what's your son doing out here?
[02:03:26.109 --> 02:03:27.670]  No, this is spring break, sir.
[02:03:27.670 --> 02:03:29.571]  And we actually went down to the Floridation.
[02:03:29.571 --> 02:03:32.853]  I protested back in January with Ms.
[02:03:32.853 --> 02:03:33.794]  McAdoo.
[02:03:33.794 --> 02:03:36.035]  And my son was down there as well.
[02:03:36.035 --> 02:03:41.278]  And unfortunately, they voted unanimously not to take the Floridation out of the water.
[02:03:41.278 --> 02:03:42.759]  And we're- Is there a control breach?
[02:03:42.759 --> 02:03:43.600]  So I brought him out here.
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:52.626]  To let him know that exercising his rights at a protest is an obligation for each generation.
[02:03:52.626 --> 02:03:56.468]  And if we don't stand up and exercise our rights, we will lose our rights.
[02:03:56.468 --> 02:04:00.571]  Our First Amendment right protects our Second Amendment right and vice versa.
[02:04:00.571 --> 02:04:09.277]  And I just wanted to get this little man out here today to let him know that there's a lot of freedom lovers out here and there's a lot of people that are very safe with their firearms.
[02:04:09.717 --> 02:04:12.198]  And we can't protect our families.
[02:04:12.198 --> 02:04:15.159]  We deserve to be able to protect our women, our children.
[02:04:15.159 --> 02:04:16.540]  Let me talk to you, son.
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:17.941]  I'll talk to you, son.
[02:04:17.941 --> 02:04:19.181]  So you came out here today.
[02:04:19.181 --> 02:04:23.423]  Do they teach you about the Second Amendment and your right to bear arms in school?
[02:04:23.423 --> 02:04:24.163]  No.
[02:04:24.163 --> 02:04:24.744]  No?
[02:04:24.744 --> 02:04:25.744]  What do they teach you about?
[02:04:25.744 --> 02:04:37.169]  They only teach me... They really only teach me about...
[02:04:40.158 --> 02:04:41.620]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:48.808]  They only teach me about voting and social studies.
[02:04:48.808 --> 02:04:51.251]  Social studies, that's all you get.
[02:04:51.251 --> 02:04:52.252]  We gotta go to break.
[02:04:52.252 --> 02:04:52.792]  Great job.
[02:04:52.792 --> 02:04:55.255]  When we come back, I want to talk about trendies.
[02:04:55.255 --> 02:04:58.659]  I want to go talk to the South by Southwest zombies.
[02:05:00.808 --> 02:05:09.878]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:09.878 --> 02:05:18.307]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:18.307 --> 02:05:22.972]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:05:23.172 --> 02:05:29.956]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:29.956 --> 02:05:37.120]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:44.144]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:05:44.144 --> 02:05:48.507]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:05:48.627 --> 02:05:52.009]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:05:52.009 --> 02:05:58.313]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:05:58.313 --> 02:06:00.754]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:00.754 --> 02:06:07.639]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
[02:06:07.639 --> 02:06:11.441]  A practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:06:11.441 --> 02:06:13.302]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:06:13.502 --> 02:06:14.382]  Fluoride.
[02:06:14.382 --> 02:06:16.303]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:16.303 --> 02:06:22.865]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:06:22.865 --> 02:06:27.786]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:06:27.786 --> 02:06:34.108]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:06:34.108 --> 02:06:36.528]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:06:36.528 --> 02:06:39.469]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:06:39.469 --> 02:06:42.850]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:48.392]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:48.392 --> 02:06:53.495]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:07:00.758 --> 02:07:03.779]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:07:03.779 --> 02:07:08.800]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:15.983]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:07:15.983 --> 02:07:21.744]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:07:21.744 --> 02:07:23.925]  These are items that I did research on.
[02:07:24.025 --> 02:07:25.766]  That I personally use.
[02:07:25.766 --> 02:07:30.488]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:07:30.488 --> 02:07:35.970]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:07:35.970 --> 02:07:39.211]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Scalzen.
[02:07:39.211 --> 02:07:41.692]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:07:41.692 --> 02:07:46.454]  Therosafe, used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:07:46.454 --> 02:07:48.895]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.
[02:07:49.335 --> 02:07:56.539]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarsShop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWars possible.
[02:07:56.539 --> 02:07:57.820]  We're getting prepared.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:58.481]  Are you?
[02:07:58.481 --> 02:08:04.965]  InfoWarsShop.com Generals gathered in their masses
[02:08:14.585 --> 02:08:17.246]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:17.246 --> 02:08:20.207]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:20.207 --> 02:08:24.748]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.748 --> 02:08:30.629]  Sorcerer of death's construction.
[02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:35.931]  In the fields the bodies burning.
[02:08:35.931 --> 02:08:39.152]  As the war machine keeps turning.
[02:08:39.152 --> 02:08:41.933]  Death and hatred.
[02:08:41.933 --> 02:08:43.253]  Death and hatred.
[02:08:45.205 --> 02:08:49.108]  Poisoning their brainwashed minds.
[02:08:49.108 --> 02:08:54.853]  Banner says it all.
[02:08:54.853 --> 02:09:06.542]  True political poetry before Ozzy Osbourne blew his brains out with drugs.
[02:09:14.102 --> 02:09:15.562]  They only started the war.
[02:09:15.562 --> 02:09:18.623]  Treating people like pawns in chess.
[02:09:18.623 --> 02:09:19.444]  Yeah.
[02:09:19.444 --> 02:09:21.224]  Treating people like pawns in chess, folks.
[02:09:51.018 --> 02:10:00.802]  Wait till their Judgment Day comes!
[02:10:00.802 --> 02:10:15.147]  Jakari Jackson, we take you now live to the Central Texas infested by Bloomberg World Bank finance anti-gunners and Jakari Jackson is interviewing a ground drone controlled from California rolling around brainwashing people.
[02:10:15.147 --> 02:10:18.628]  Jakari Jackson, tell us about the robot controlled by a humanoid.
[02:10:19.901 --> 02:10:26.346]  Okay, miss, I don't know if you can see behind us, but we had a large crowd of people armed with their firearms, their long guns strapped to their back.
[02:10:26.346 --> 02:10:29.728]  What do you think about the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms?
[02:10:29.728 --> 02:10:30.689]  Oh, you know what?
[02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:31.469]  I'm on the clock.
[02:10:31.469 --> 02:10:33.871]  I'm probably going to plead the fifth on any of that.
[02:10:33.871 --> 02:10:35.012]  Okay, she's going to plead the fifth.
[02:10:35.012 --> 02:10:38.034]  At least she knows one of her rights, which is very good.
[02:10:38.034 --> 02:10:39.035]  Well, we'll continue on.
[02:10:39.035 --> 02:10:39.735]  We're moving down here.
[02:10:39.735 --> 02:10:40.836]  Let's go back to the robot briefly.
[02:10:40.836 --> 02:10:41.677]  That's interesting.
[02:10:42.449 --> 02:10:44.951]  Ask the robot if we will be assimilated.
[02:10:44.951 --> 02:10:45.191]  Yes.
[02:10:45.191 --> 02:10:47.473]  Okay, if I could just ask you one final question, miss.
[02:10:47.473 --> 02:10:51.616]  Do you think the human population will be assimilated?
[02:10:51.616 --> 02:10:52.797]  I hope not.
[02:10:52.797 --> 02:10:54.138]  You hope not, okay.
[02:10:54.138 --> 02:10:54.619]  Good, good.
[02:10:54.619 --> 02:10:56.020]  Well, Jakari, I think she likes you.
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:57.481]  Now listen, let's go back to her.
[02:10:57.481 --> 02:10:58.322]  Ask her her name.
[02:10:58.322 --> 02:10:59.683]  That wouldn't be too bad.
[02:10:59.683 --> 02:11:00.584]  Exactly.
[02:11:00.584 --> 02:11:02.465]  Get her to tell us about the robot.
[02:11:02.465 --> 02:11:05.287]  Okay, can you tell us about your kiosk, your kiosk that's rolling away right here?
[02:11:05.287 --> 02:11:06.608]  I'll try to keep it steady.
[02:11:06.608 --> 02:11:07.509]  What's the kiosk about?
[02:11:07.509 --> 02:11:09.771]  So yeah, it's called a beam.
[02:11:10.581 --> 02:11:15.888]  And it's a remote presence device, and it's designed to allow a person to be two places at once.
[02:11:15.888 --> 02:11:20.354]  So like I said, I'm in Kansas City, but I'm completely controlling this device from my desk here.
[02:11:20.354 --> 02:11:25.660]  I've got just a regular webcam, and I'm controlling it using the arrow keys on my keyboard.
[02:11:26.261 --> 02:11:30.465]  By the way, I'm thinking about moving out of Austin and broadcasting them somewhere.
[02:11:30.465 --> 02:11:34.068]  And I could have one of these roll around and gripe at people.
[02:11:34.068 --> 02:11:40.454]  Actually, I could have little Daleks in multiple offices call people into the conference room and fire them over the robot.
[02:11:40.454 --> 02:11:41.936]  I'm joking.
[02:11:41.936 --> 02:11:45.279]  I'm telling you, I actually may want to buy one of those.
[02:11:45.279 --> 02:11:49.703]  Jakari, would you like it if I worked from home and the robot came in and I talked to you over that?
[02:11:50.547 --> 02:11:54.529]  I don't think you would actually have the self, the will to stay at home, Alex.
[02:11:54.529 --> 02:11:58.170]  You like being in the studio no matter what.
[02:11:58.170 --> 02:11:59.411]  I guess you are right, Jakari.
[02:11:59.411 --> 02:12:03.672]  But I'm telling you, it does have some obnoxious applications, doesn't it?
[02:12:03.672 --> 02:12:04.573]  Yeah.
[02:12:04.573 --> 02:12:10.515]  I mean, you could drive it around, I guess, City Hall or someplace and scream at the politicians.
[02:12:10.515 --> 02:12:15.037]  Jakari, let's go talk to some of the South by Southwest people.
[02:12:15.037 --> 02:12:15.837]  What's happened?
[02:12:15.837 --> 02:12:18.258]  Have any of the trendies... We've got a large crowd coming by.
[02:12:19.352 --> 02:12:21.574]  Have any of the trendies freaked out to see people with guns?
[02:12:21.574 --> 02:12:24.235]  No, no, we haven't, we haven't met anybody who's freaked out with guns.
[02:12:24.235 --> 02:12:29.439]  We've actually lost our crowd, Alex, so if we can get closer to the crowd, we can have people... Yeah, let's do that because here's what I want.
[02:12:29.439 --> 02:12:33.902]  I want as trendies walk by looking at their smartphones, I want you to say, hey, that man has a gun.
[02:12:33.902 --> 02:12:35.263]  What do you think?
[02:12:35.263 --> 02:12:36.564]  Okay, very good.
[02:12:36.564 --> 02:12:37.865]  Hey, excuse me, sir.
[02:12:37.865 --> 02:12:39.026]  Are you concerned?
[02:12:39.026 --> 02:12:39.726]  Okay.
[02:12:39.726 --> 02:12:40.467]  Excuse me, guys.
[02:12:40.467 --> 02:12:41.007]  He's too trendy.
[02:12:41.007 --> 02:12:44.009]  Are you concerned at all that these guys have guns over here?
[02:12:44.009 --> 02:12:44.450]  What?
[02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:47.672]  Are you concerned at all that these guys have guns over here?
[02:12:47.672 --> 02:12:47.752]  Uh...
[02:12:48.667 --> 02:12:49.247]  No.
[02:12:49.247 --> 02:12:49.827]  No?
[02:12:49.827 --> 02:12:50.367]  Yep.
[02:12:50.367 --> 02:12:50.968]  Ask him why.
[02:12:50.968 --> 02:12:52.068]  Austin here.
[02:12:52.068 --> 02:12:52.568]  Austin here.
[02:12:52.568 --> 02:12:56.549]  So, why are you not concerned about these guys with all their firearms?
[02:12:56.549 --> 02:13:01.470]  Well, I mean, if they're using them properly, then why should I be concerned?
[02:13:01.470 --> 02:13:01.890]  Exactly.
[02:13:01.890 --> 02:13:04.291]  Can we see a shot of the trooper on his shirt, please?
[02:13:04.291 --> 02:13:04.931]  Thank you, sir.
[02:13:04.931 --> 02:13:05.351]  No, no, no.
[02:13:05.351 --> 02:13:06.111]  The trooper on his shirt.
[02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:07.152]  I must look at it.
[02:13:07.152 --> 02:13:07.732]  Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
[02:13:07.732 --> 02:13:10.532]  If I get one shot of your shirt right there.
[02:13:10.532 --> 02:13:11.513]  Oh, that's not the trooper.
[02:13:11.513 --> 02:13:12.253]  That is Eddie.
[02:13:12.253 --> 02:13:12.533]  Okay.
[02:13:13.291 --> 02:13:13.851]  That's it.
[02:13:13.851 --> 02:13:15.412]  I don't think Eddie needs a gun.
[02:13:15.412 --> 02:13:16.433]  Thank you, sir.
[02:13:16.433 --> 02:13:17.153]  Alright, thank you.
[02:13:17.153 --> 02:13:19.435]  Alright, move up here to the crowd, Alex.
[02:13:19.435 --> 02:13:20.816]  Alright, yeah, let's go talk to the crowd.
[02:13:20.816 --> 02:13:21.356]  Hey, Cody!
[02:13:21.356 --> 02:13:21.716]  Hey, Cody!
[02:13:21.716 --> 02:13:25.519]  Hey, Alex, you know Cody Wilson, we're broadcasting live.
[02:13:25.519 --> 02:13:25.959]  Yes, we are.
[02:13:28.655 --> 02:13:31.218]  Hey, you're the inventor of the 3D printable gun!
[02:13:31.218 --> 02:13:33.901]  Listen, man, that's some incredible shit.
[02:13:33.901 --> 02:13:35.002]  Oh, we're live, bro.
[02:13:35.002 --> 02:13:37.725]  We have to delay it.
[02:13:37.725 --> 02:13:43.391]  There's some liberals I was hanging out with last night saying, look man, I saw people walking around with, like, fucking, like, machine guns and stuff.
[02:13:43.391 --> 02:13:44.873]  Alright, bro, you gotta watch it out.
[02:13:44.873 --> 02:13:46.334]  We can't have Cody Wilson on.
[02:13:46.334 --> 02:13:47.396]  He does that in studio, too.
[02:13:48.664 --> 02:13:50.685]  He was the printable gun pioneer.
[02:13:50.685 --> 02:13:54.566]  He also did some stuff with Bitcoin, but he's known largely for his printable gun work.
[02:13:54.566 --> 02:13:59.108]  And then people hear us delay people on the radio and they go, Alex lied and said that guy was cussing.
[02:13:59.108 --> 02:13:59.809]  I didn't hear it.
[02:13:59.809 --> 02:14:02.610]  That's because we delay it out.
[02:14:02.610 --> 02:14:06.951]  Find it someplace else, but, you know, we're trying to keep it PG for the audience.
[02:14:06.951 --> 02:14:08.472]  We'll move up here a little bit more.
[02:14:08.472 --> 02:14:11.313]  This is a PG family show.
[02:14:11.313 --> 02:14:11.833]  Yes.
[02:14:11.833 --> 02:14:12.214]  Excuse me, sir.
[02:14:12.214 --> 02:14:14.194]  What do you think about all these people with guns?
[02:14:14.194 --> 02:14:14.655]  It's fine.
[02:14:14.655 --> 02:14:15.775]  It's fine?
[02:14:15.775 --> 02:14:16.215]  All right.
[02:14:16.215 --> 02:14:18.056]  Listen, Jakari, let me tell you what I found out.
[02:14:18.735 --> 02:14:25.982]  Again, I went out with the cast of Silicon Valley with Mike Judge yesterday and a lot of these people had never shot guns.
[02:14:25.982 --> 02:14:32.508]  They were from California and they were literally getting excited and were being possessed by the spirit of Redneck 1776.
[02:14:33.919 --> 02:14:40.742]  Well, you remember when your vanquished foe, Piers Morgan, went and shot the machine guns.
[02:14:40.742 --> 02:14:42.903]  He looked quite happy when he was shooting all those machine guns.
[02:14:42.903 --> 02:14:51.668]  We were sent the raw, high-def footage and audio, but my lawyers looked at it, and we decided not to go with it, even though we probably could have gotten away with it.
[02:14:51.668 --> 02:14:54.169]  But it was Piers Morgan saying, I want some of these.
[02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:55.169]  I want to move to Texas.
[02:14:55.169 --> 02:14:55.830]  I want guns.
[02:14:56.923 --> 02:15:02.488]  After, because they have full surveillance in that gun range, publicly for everybody's security as they say.
[02:15:02.488 --> 02:15:06.412]  And yeah, we have high def of Piers Morgan.
[02:15:06.412 --> 02:15:07.473]  We have the whole thing.
[02:15:07.473 --> 02:15:13.078]  We have, when I walk out and they go, we admit you have the highest ratings ever when you were on, but the higher ups don't want you on.
[02:15:13.078 --> 02:15:16.261]  We only use what I was allowed to shoot on my iPhone where he knew I was taping.
[02:15:16.761 --> 02:15:18.602]  But no, we have the high def of it.
[02:15:18.602 --> 02:15:21.324]  It's all back there on Rob Jacobson's computer.
[02:15:21.324 --> 02:15:24.385]  Of Piers Morgan showing the fact that he really wants guns.
[02:15:24.385 --> 02:15:25.786]  And that he's nothing but a hired mercenary.
[02:15:25.786 --> 02:15:27.747]  He has armed guards at his house, guys.
[02:15:27.747 --> 02:15:28.668]  He lives in a gated community.
[02:15:28.668 --> 02:15:33.771]  Yes, there was a police officer in Veritas who went there and exposed that he had the firearms, the armed security, to respond to his home.
[02:15:34.397 --> 02:15:35.037]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:35.037 --> 02:15:38.119]  So he lives behind armored gates with armed security and has armed security.
[02:15:38.119 --> 02:15:40.000]  And you know, that's fine.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.261]  You know, I've been at Charlie Sheen's house.
[02:15:41.261 --> 02:15:41.961]  He's got armed security.
[02:15:41.961 --> 02:15:45.563]  You know, the whole point is, is that don't take my guns away.
[02:15:45.563 --> 02:15:49.545]  You know, not everybody has the money to have armed security at their house, Shikari.
[02:15:49.545 --> 02:15:49.945]  That's right.
[02:15:49.945 --> 02:15:50.446]  I don't.
[02:15:50.446 --> 02:15:51.106]  I definitely don't.
[02:15:51.106 --> 02:15:53.687]  I sure don't.
[02:15:53.687 --> 02:15:56.689]  Yeah, so we're actually at the convention center now, Alex.
[02:15:57.327 --> 02:15:59.148]  It's a little light out here as far as the crowd.
[02:15:59.148 --> 02:15:59.828]  I'm a little surprised.
[02:15:59.828 --> 02:16:04.891]  We came out here a couple days ago for the Snowden deal and there are many more people than what there are now.
[02:16:04.891 --> 02:16:06.331]  But it's still a decent crowd out here.
[02:16:06.331 --> 02:16:08.972]  Well, you've got to find where the trendies are nesting.
[02:16:08.972 --> 02:16:18.397]  Down off First Street, up there by, I don't know, Cesar Chavez and right by 35 is normally crawling with trendies.
[02:16:19.093 --> 02:16:19.993]  Yes.
[02:16:19.993 --> 02:16:21.274]  It's making the rounds here.
[02:16:21.274 --> 02:16:22.294]  Our crowd looks huge.
[02:16:22.294 --> 02:16:23.394]  How big is it now?
[02:16:23.394 --> 02:16:26.936]  Yeah, we have at least, wouldn't you say about a hundred people at least, Jess?
[02:16:26.936 --> 02:16:28.416]  At least a hundred people.
[02:16:28.416 --> 02:16:29.576]  Most of them aren't.
[02:16:29.576 --> 02:16:31.697]  Hey, how many people do you think we've got here, bro?
[02:16:31.697 --> 02:16:36.619]  You know, I didn't even try to count, but seeing it from back here, it sounds like you're on the right track there.
[02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:42.083]  Yeah, another man, another man concerned about his freedoms, about his personal liberties.
[02:16:42.083 --> 02:16:43.504]  Show us what you got here, bro.
[02:16:43.504 --> 02:16:46.645]  This is my second rifle that I've built.
[02:16:46.645 --> 02:16:47.746]  Full custom all the way.
[02:16:47.746 --> 02:16:51.487]  Literally at least a dozen brands that I put this thing together with.
[02:16:51.487 --> 02:16:53.568]  It's my own thing.
[02:16:53.568 --> 02:16:54.449]  That's the coolest thing about the AR-15.
[02:16:54.449 --> 02:16:55.869]  Totally untraceable.
[02:16:55.869 --> 02:16:56.970]  It is fully customizable.
[02:16:56.970 --> 02:16:57.730]  You make it your own.
[02:16:57.730 --> 02:16:58.630]  Mine is one of a kind.
[02:16:58.630 --> 02:16:59.631]  Watch my stuff here.
[02:16:59.631 --> 02:16:59.971]  Thanks, bro.
[02:17:00.191 --> 02:17:05.636]  Hey, hey, hey, uh, get everybody's take on Bloomberg now trying to restrict free speech on Facebook that's pro-gun.
[02:17:05.636 --> 02:17:07.818]  I mean, this guy is an absolute would-be despot.
[02:17:07.818 --> 02:17:08.318]  Yes, yes.
[02:17:08.318 --> 02:17:11.481]  Okay, let's move up here, uh, trying to keep up with the crowd here.
[02:17:11.481 --> 02:17:14.224]  All right.
[02:17:14.224 --> 02:17:15.224]  Yeah, watch out.
[02:17:15.224 --> 02:17:18.667]  We got a lot of obstacles out here in the way as we move towards the crowd.
[02:17:18.667 --> 02:17:21.370]  Let's ask this, excuse me, sir, sir.
[02:17:22.093 --> 02:17:29.138]  What do you think about Mary Bloomberg and his attacks on not only the Second Amendment, but the First Amendment, trying to censor your gun speech on Facebook?
[02:17:29.138 --> 02:17:30.659]  My own words, he's an idiot.
[02:17:30.659 --> 02:17:31.100]  Yeah?
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:31.940]  He's an idiot.
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:32.741]  Anything more?
[02:17:32.741 --> 02:17:34.282]  Would you like to elaborate on why he's an idiot?
[02:17:35.074 --> 02:17:43.757]  Well, you know, he's got all that money and God only knows where all he got it, but he's using that money to try to take away people's freedoms, which to me is just outright bizarre.
[02:17:43.757 --> 02:17:44.297]  Yes.
[02:17:44.297 --> 02:17:45.198]  Well, it's not bizarre.
[02:17:45.198 --> 02:17:51.820]  It's, you know, it's pretty, it's pretty standard for people to want you to be disarmed and not have your free speech while they themselves enjoy those same things.
[02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:54.181]  Like we see Mayor Bloomberg, he has multiple bodyguards.
[02:17:54.181 --> 02:17:58.162]  And when he was approached by a journalist and the journalist asked him, sir, would you disarm your bodyguards?
[02:17:58.162 --> 02:17:59.803]  He said, uh, I'll get back to you on that.
[02:18:00.043 --> 02:18:01.944]  Yeah, I get back to you on that.
[02:18:01.944 --> 02:18:06.147]  I would like to see him disarm his bodyguards and then come back in and try to take everybody else's guns.
[02:18:06.147 --> 02:18:10.129]  Because chances are if somebody with a gun would be protecting his, sorry, backside.
[02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.709]  Yeah.
[02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:11.150]  All right.
[02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.810]  Thank you, sir.
[02:18:11.810 --> 02:18:13.491]  Well said, Lord Vader.
[02:18:13.491 --> 02:18:14.171]  Yes.
[02:18:14.171 --> 02:18:16.753]  So we got some good patriots out here, Alex.
[02:18:16.753 --> 02:18:17.473]  Some great people.
[02:18:17.473 --> 02:18:20.375]  We've talked to some nice people who are concerned about their rights.
[02:18:20.375 --> 02:18:22.376]  Sir, what do you think about all these guys with the guns?
[02:18:22.376 --> 02:18:23.057]  Come in here.
[02:18:23.057 --> 02:18:23.617]  Both of you guys, come on.
[02:18:23.617 --> 02:18:26.178]  What do you think about these guys with the guns out here?
[02:18:26.178 --> 02:18:27.699]  Um, it's pretty dangerous.
[02:18:27.699 --> 02:18:28.540]  It's pretty dangerous?
[02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:28.680]  Yeah.
[02:18:29.168 --> 02:18:30.710]  Why is the government on guard?
[02:18:46.408 --> 02:18:46.528]  Yeah.
[02:18:46.528 --> 02:18:48.390]  What do you think about... He's a police officer.
[02:18:48.390 --> 02:18:50.932]  His job is to serve and protect.
[02:18:50.932 --> 02:18:52.373]  Where are you from, sir, if you don't mind me asking?
[02:18:52.373 --> 02:18:53.154]  I'm from Austin.
[02:18:53.154 --> 02:18:53.814]  You're from Austin, Texas?
[02:18:53.814 --> 02:18:55.296]  He's a warrior, Ant.
[02:18:55.296 --> 02:18:56.757]  We are servant ants.
[02:18:56.757 --> 02:18:59.079]  Would you like to see, you know, people not have firearms?
[02:18:59.079 --> 02:19:00.760]  What's your stance on the Second Amendment?
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:02.442]  My stance on the Second Amendment is, um...
[02:19:03.174 --> 02:19:07.997]  I believe people should have firearms, but they don't need to be walking around with assault weapons.
[02:19:07.997 --> 02:19:10.779]  Hey, ask this ding-dong where he's really from.
[02:19:10.779 --> 02:19:12.220]  Now go back to the ding-dong.
[02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:14.041]  Ask that ding-dong where he's really from.
[02:19:14.041 --> 02:19:15.242]  Where are you originally from, ding-dong?
[02:19:15.242 --> 02:19:16.643]  Are you originally from Austin, Texas?
[02:19:16.643 --> 02:19:18.504]  No, I'm originally from East Coast.
[02:19:18.504 --> 02:19:19.264]  East Jersey.
[02:19:19.264 --> 02:19:19.785]  New Jersey.
[02:19:19.785 --> 02:19:20.145]  Okay.
[02:19:20.145 --> 02:19:20.765]  Oh, no wonder.
[02:19:20.765 --> 02:19:22.026]  Hey, listen.
[02:19:22.026 --> 02:19:25.308]  Listen, you have the highest crime rates there because they restrict the guns, dumbass.
[02:19:25.308 --> 02:19:26.049]  All right, sir.
[02:19:26.049 --> 02:19:27.310]  Let me compare and contrast that, Alex.
[02:19:27.310 --> 02:19:28.530]  Okay, so I'm here with this gentleman.
[02:19:28.530 --> 02:19:29.391]  Sir, can we see your firearm?
[02:19:30.655 --> 02:19:31.115]  Okay.
[02:19:31.115 --> 02:19:32.456]  Does that scare that little twit?
[02:19:32.456 --> 02:19:34.636]  Before I go to you, sir, you see this man with his firearm.
[02:19:34.636 --> 02:19:38.417]  What do you think about this man and his firearm?
[02:19:38.417 --> 02:19:39.438]  What do I think about him?
[02:19:39.438 --> 02:19:41.578]  What do you know about him walking around with a firearm?
[02:19:41.578 --> 02:19:44.659]  I like to live under the Mafia in New Jersey with a big fat governor.
[02:19:44.659 --> 02:19:46.960]  I don't think that this is an unsafe place.
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:49.821]  There's really no need to be walking around the streets with a firearm.
[02:19:49.821 --> 02:19:50.601]  Keep it in your house.
[02:19:50.601 --> 02:19:51.401]  Protect your home.
[02:19:51.401 --> 02:19:51.761]  You know?
[02:19:51.761 --> 02:19:53.862]  Yeah, you don't need to sit at the front of the bus in front of everybody.
[02:19:53.862 --> 02:19:54.282]  Is there a reason?
[02:19:54.282 --> 02:19:56.563]  First, I'd like to clarify this is not an assault rifle.
[02:19:56.563 --> 02:19:57.863]  It is a semi-automatic rifle.
[02:19:58.203 --> 02:20:02.364]  So that's one of the common misunderstandings that gets brought up in these conversations.
[02:20:02.364 --> 02:20:04.325]  I tend to disagree with my friend here.
[02:20:04.325 --> 02:20:09.487]  I think that even though the job of the police is to protect and serve, they can't be with you all the time.
[02:20:09.487 --> 02:20:12.228]  You should have the ability to protect yourself, your family.
[02:20:12.228 --> 02:20:15.269]  The courts have ruled the police have no responsibility to protect you.
[02:20:15.269 --> 02:20:21.010]  ...from a tyrannical government... ...to face trials... ...you know, intended for, yes.
[02:20:21.010 --> 02:20:22.451]  Sir, do you have any comment to what he just said?
[02:20:22.938 --> 02:20:24.258]  The tyrannical government.
[02:20:24.258 --> 02:20:25.419]  What's tyrannical?
[02:20:25.419 --> 02:20:26.239]  We're walking around here.
[02:20:26.239 --> 02:20:30.960]  Well, you have the Austin Police Department that has arrested people for jaywalking when they failed to identify.
[02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:33.300]  You have people being tased and bashed.
[02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:36.321]  Every authoritarian regime takes the guns.
[02:20:36.321 --> 02:20:37.501]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:20:37.501 --> 02:20:38.602]  It's not encouraging.
[02:20:38.602 --> 02:20:40.882]  Tell him, Hitler took the guns.
[02:20:40.882 --> 02:20:42.803]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:20:42.803 --> 02:20:48.464]  They arrested a young lady because she failed to identify, but you don't have to identify to a police officer if you're not under arrest.
[02:20:48.464 --> 02:20:49.444]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:20:49.444 --> 02:20:50.565]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:20:50.565 --> 02:20:51.585]  Tell him, Zatari.
[02:20:51.585 --> 02:20:52.285]  Do you make mistakes?
[02:20:53.454 --> 02:20:54.777]  Okay, let me ask you this.
[02:20:54.777 --> 02:20:55.779]  Let's talk about some more things.
[02:20:56.107 --> 02:20:58.588]  You say, you know, what's tyrannical about the government?
[02:20:58.588 --> 02:21:00.029]  You see, uh, the surveillance measures.
[02:21:00.029 --> 02:21:03.872]  We have more than 40 cameras downtown that are filming you, you know, without your permission.
[02:21:03.872 --> 02:21:04.772]  Are you okay with that?
[02:21:04.772 --> 02:21:05.953]  I'm totally cool with it.
[02:21:05.953 --> 02:21:06.393]  Okay.
[02:21:06.393 --> 02:21:08.734]  So are you okay with, uh, the Department of Homeland Security?
[02:21:08.734 --> 02:21:14.558]  You're concerned about this gentleman and his guns, but the Department of Homeland Security has bought over 1 billion bullets that they can't use.
[02:21:14.558 --> 02:21:16.879]  I'm not necessarily concerned about this gentleman and his gun.
[02:21:16.879 --> 02:21:18.360]  I just don't think that there's a need to be.
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:20.881]  Bring up history to him, Jakari, about Hitler, Stalin.
[02:21:20.881 --> 02:21:23.563]  Okay, so when you hear the stories, right?
[02:21:23.563 --> 02:21:25.344]  So when you hear the stories about, uh, disarmament,
[02:21:25.859 --> 02:21:26.600]  I hear lots of stories.
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:27.740]  I don't know if they're true.
[02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:28.981]  What's happening in Connecticut?
[02:21:38.738 --> 02:21:39.058]  Obama?
[02:21:39.058 --> 02:21:39.539]  Have you seen?
[02:21:39.539 --> 02:21:41.060]  Okay, you brought up Obama.
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:41.680]  Let me ask you, bro.
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:42.620]  Let me ask you, bro.
[02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:43.701]  Okay.
[02:21:43.701 --> 02:21:48.944]  Okay, you saw him in the debates with Mitt Romney saying he wanted to ban assault rifles, even though these aren't assault rifles.
[02:21:48.944 --> 02:21:51.206]  You saw him in a debate say he wants to ban cheap handguns.
[02:21:51.206 --> 02:21:52.186]  You have people such as Ms.
[02:21:52.186 --> 02:21:55.748]  Dianne Feinstein who want to ban things for cosmetic features.
[02:21:55.748 --> 02:21:56.269]  Come here, come here, sir.
[02:21:56.269 --> 02:21:57.189]  Can I take a look at you?
[02:21:57.189 --> 02:21:59.331]  If we can turn around and show this gentleman.
[02:21:59.331 --> 02:21:59.691]  Okay, now,
[02:22:00.371 --> 02:22:07.054]  In the state of New York, they say you can't have this gun because of the pistol grip, but if you change it to more of a butt socket, then that's fine.
[02:22:07.054 --> 02:22:09.115]  So they're trying to ban guns for cosmetic features.
[02:22:09.115 --> 02:22:10.716]  They're not banning any guns.
[02:22:10.716 --> 02:22:11.256]  Yes, they are, sir.
[02:22:11.256 --> 02:22:12.637]  That's not actually happening.
[02:22:12.637 --> 02:22:14.178]  Yes, they are.
[02:22:14.178 --> 02:22:15.638]  No, I'm talking about in New York.
[02:22:15.638 --> 02:22:16.379]  I'm talking about in New York.
[02:22:16.379 --> 02:22:16.899]  We're not in New York.
[02:22:16.899 --> 02:22:17.659]  We're in Texas.
[02:22:17.659 --> 02:22:18.780]  Well, that's still a tyrannical government.
[02:22:18.780 --> 02:22:19.480]  Bloomberg's down here!
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:23.542]  For five years, Obama has supposedly been banning guns, and guess what?
[02:22:23.542 --> 02:22:24.743]  We're all still walking around with guns.
[02:22:24.743 --> 02:22:25.643]  Because we beat his legislation.
[02:22:25.643 --> 02:22:27.124]  That's because the legislation failed, sir.
[02:22:28.226 --> 02:22:30.427]  Yes, Connecticut is the one I brought up.
[02:22:30.427 --> 02:22:34.010]  If we had a tyrannical government, we wouldn't be sitting here talking to each other.
[02:22:34.010 --> 02:22:34.910]  I'm walking around free.
[02:22:34.910 --> 02:22:35.811]  Nobody's banning anything.
[02:22:56.639 --> 02:22:59.265]  Sir, okay, well, we gotta catch up with the crowd.
[02:22:59.265 --> 02:23:01.309]  We're freely speaking, right?
[02:23:01.309 --> 02:23:02.131]  So who's banning?
[02:23:02.131 --> 02:23:02.452]  Who's banning?
[02:23:02.452 --> 02:23:04.215]  No, I'm talking about Facebook.
[02:23:04.215 --> 02:23:04.836]  Michelle Obama.
[02:23:05.470 --> 02:23:06.970]  Dude, they're not going to ban the word Boston.
[02:23:06.970 --> 02:23:08.411]  Well, that doesn't stop them from trying, sir.
[02:23:08.411 --> 02:23:11.191]  That's just making money off of Webflix, creating hysteria.
[02:23:11.191 --> 02:23:12.151]  Nobody's banning guns.
[02:23:12.151 --> 02:23:13.152]  Nobody's banning free speech.
[02:23:13.152 --> 02:23:13.552]  Nobody?
[02:23:13.552 --> 02:23:14.892]  Dianne Feinstein?
[02:23:14.892 --> 02:23:15.692]  Joe Biden?
[02:23:15.692 --> 02:23:16.172]  Nobody?
[02:23:16.172 --> 02:23:16.552]  No.
[02:23:16.552 --> 02:23:17.253]  Nope.
[02:23:17.253 --> 02:23:21.974]  Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez, who said he wants to make the gun ban legitimate?
[02:23:21.974 --> 02:23:23.114]  That's not going to happen.
[02:23:23.114 --> 02:23:24.294]  Well, that doesn't stop them from trying.
[02:23:24.294 --> 02:23:26.074]  They say there's no tyrannical government.
[02:23:26.074 --> 02:23:27.215]  There are people trying.
[02:23:27.215 --> 02:23:28.615]  Even though they try and fail, it doesn't stop them.
[02:23:28.615 --> 02:23:30.395]  They ban the guns in every city they control.
[02:23:30.395 --> 02:23:32.176]  Do you even know what tyranny is?
[02:23:32.176 --> 02:23:32.656]  Tyranny?
[02:23:34.411 --> 02:23:35.412]  I'm having a conversation.
[02:23:35.412 --> 02:23:36.132]  NSA spying.
[02:23:36.132 --> 02:23:37.212]  Jakari, this guy's an idiot.
[02:23:37.212 --> 02:23:38.173]  With a rifle.
[02:23:38.173 --> 02:23:39.774]  You're free!
[02:23:39.774 --> 02:23:42.455]  Yes, sir, but we have NSA spying, sir.
[02:23:42.455 --> 02:23:44.676]  Is that not tyranny?
[02:23:44.676 --> 02:23:45.297]  No knock warrants.
[02:23:45.297 --> 02:23:48.858]  When they kick in your door at 3 in the morning and shoot the wrong guy, they come to your house, shoot your dog.
[02:23:48.858 --> 02:23:50.419]  You know what?
[02:23:50.419 --> 02:23:52.200]  Large governments make mistakes.
[02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:54.641]  We have the largest prison population.
[02:23:54.641 --> 02:23:58.283]  Is it a mistake when they come and shoot your dog?
[02:23:58.283 --> 02:23:59.364]  Ask him if Hitler made a mistake.
[02:24:00.074 --> 02:24:01.655]  Is it a mistake when this guy comes?
[02:24:01.655 --> 02:24:02.315]  That was a mistake.
[02:24:02.315 --> 02:24:03.436]  Is that a mistake?
[02:24:03.436 --> 02:24:04.156]  No, that's not a mistake.
[02:24:04.156 --> 02:24:05.376]  It's this guy wants to save your life.
[02:24:05.376 --> 02:24:07.738]  Did Hitler make a mistake taking the guns?
[02:24:07.738 --> 02:24:10.299]  Did Hitler make the mistake taking the guns, sir?
[02:24:10.299 --> 02:24:11.739]  What's Hitler got to do with anything?
[02:24:11.739 --> 02:24:12.000]  It's Stalin.
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:12.620]  It's history, sir.
[02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:13.600]  Stalin, Mao.
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:15.301]  We're in the United States.
[02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:16.762]  What's this got to do with Hitler?
[02:24:16.762 --> 02:24:19.123]  The first gun laws were against black people after the Civil War.
[02:24:19.123 --> 02:24:21.484]  Other countries being repeated here, that has nothing to do with history.
[02:24:22.555 --> 02:24:23.656]  No, we're in the United States.
[02:24:23.656 --> 02:24:26.497]  What happens in Germany has to do with what's happening here.
[02:24:26.497 --> 02:24:27.578]  We're walking around free.
[02:24:27.578 --> 02:24:30.919]  Well, you know, they say the people who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[02:24:30.919 --> 02:24:34.881]  So when you see, the reason I bring this up, you can see these things happen in other countries.
[02:24:34.881 --> 02:24:38.603]  And when those same things are attempted to happen here, like you said, many times they do fail.
[02:24:38.603 --> 02:24:40.864]  But when they're attempted to happen here, you say that has no relevance.
[02:24:41.024 --> 02:24:42.265]  They say lots of things.
[02:24:42.265 --> 02:24:45.647]  They say, for five years, Obama's been taking our guns.
[02:24:45.647 --> 02:24:47.588]  You just saw 30 people walk by with us.
[02:24:47.588 --> 02:24:49.470]  That's because he tried and failed, sir.
[02:24:49.470 --> 02:24:51.171]  That's because we're beating him, dumbass.
[02:24:51.171 --> 02:24:51.971]  Excuse me, folks, I apologize.
[02:24:51.971 --> 02:24:55.354]  So you think that the president has enough power to just go ahead and take guns?
[02:24:55.354 --> 02:24:56.795]  He obviously doesn't.
[02:24:56.795 --> 02:24:57.855]  I understand what you're saying.
[02:24:57.855 --> 02:24:58.816]  He's banning importation!
[02:24:59.616 --> 02:25:01.959]  You're creating hysteria about nothing.
[02:25:01.959 --> 02:25:03.101]  How are we creating hysteria?
[02:25:03.101 --> 02:25:05.444]  He wants to deny what's happening so he can take over.
[02:25:05.444 --> 02:25:05.865]  He doesn't.
[02:25:05.865 --> 02:25:07.868]  What is the assault rifle, sir?
[02:25:07.868 --> 02:25:09.370]  Nobody's ever going to take those guns.
[02:25:09.370 --> 02:25:13.997]  There's 300... There's... They're now confiscating them in California, Connecticut, and New York.
[02:25:13.997 --> 02:25:14.738]  What are you talking about?
[02:25:15.612 --> 02:25:16.693]  This is Texas!
[02:25:16.693 --> 02:25:20.438]  You keep saying, okay, alright, you said don't bring up... No, no, no, let me, let me, let's, let's take it all the way.
[02:25:20.438 --> 02:25:22.160]  We're not gonna let the other states fall, punk.
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:28.248]  We're not in Germany, but when I talk about a city in the United States or a state in the United States, you say, what does that have to do with anything?
[02:25:28.248 --> 02:25:28.489]  What?
[02:25:28.489 --> 02:25:30.010]  Okay, let's talk about Austin, Texas.
[02:25:30.010 --> 02:25:33.535]  Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez said he wanted to make the gun ban legitimate.
[02:25:34.139 --> 02:25:36.300]  Mike Martinez is one individual.
[02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:39.681]  He's part of Mayors Against Illegal Guns?
[02:25:39.681 --> 02:25:43.342]  They do lots of different things.
[02:25:43.342 --> 02:25:44.762]  Here's the deal.
[02:25:44.762 --> 02:25:48.103]  There are too many guns in this country for guns to ever be taken.
[02:25:48.103 --> 02:25:52.324]  So you guys can sit here and say, oh, they're going to take this and they're going to take that.
[02:25:52.324 --> 02:25:53.585]  And that's never going to happen.
[02:25:53.585 --> 02:25:54.925]  It's just, it's impossible.
[02:25:54.925 --> 02:25:58.346]  So basically... Let me tell you, let me tell you.
[02:25:58.346 --> 02:26:01.367]  At Sunnyvale, California, they have banned, you know, they have banned
[02:26:01.807 --> 02:26:05.432]  High capacity magazines, you know, magazines that hold... Colorado?
[02:26:05.432 --> 02:26:05.873]  Excellent!
[02:26:05.873 --> 02:26:06.373]  That's great!
[02:26:06.373 --> 02:26:07.775]  They probably should ban high capacity.
[02:26:07.775 --> 02:26:12.221]  But you're saying no one's taking the guns, but they're just banning your magazines.
[02:26:13.317 --> 02:26:14.917]  That is called making things safer.
[02:26:14.917 --> 02:26:15.698]  You know what?
[02:26:15.698 --> 02:26:16.898]  Okay, now you said nobody.
[02:26:16.898 --> 02:26:17.538]  You said nobody.
[02:26:17.538 --> 02:26:22.579]  I'm telling you a city that's happening right now, Sunnyvale, California, and you're saying that it's not, that's a good deal.
[02:26:22.579 --> 02:26:23.760]  Are they taking guns?
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:25.060]  They're moving towards it.
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:26.881]  And once again, once again, hold on, bro.
[02:26:26.881 --> 02:26:28.441]  Let me tell you, let me tell you, bro.
[02:26:28.441 --> 02:26:31.242]  In New York, once again, we're going back to the cosmetic features.
[02:26:31.242 --> 02:26:33.222]  They ban guns based on cosmetic features.
[02:26:33.222 --> 02:26:36.383]  They say you have to turn in your gun, destroy it, or they can come and get it from you.
[02:26:36.383 --> 02:26:37.763]  Is that not confiscating guns?
[02:26:37.763 --> 02:26:39.164]  Are guns legal in New York?
[02:26:39.164 --> 02:26:39.864]  Yes, they are.
[02:26:39.864 --> 02:26:40.124]  Okay.
[02:26:40.584 --> 02:26:41.385]  Not all guns.
[02:26:41.385 --> 02:26:41.986]  No, no, no, no.
[02:26:41.986 --> 02:26:42.847]  They ban most of them.
[02:26:42.847 --> 02:26:44.509]  In New York City, they're banned.
[02:26:44.509 --> 02:26:50.956]  They're saying if you have a firearm with a cosmetic feature, like the... The goal is to ban all the guns!
[02:26:50.956 --> 02:26:53.619]  You take a step to try to make things safer.
[02:26:53.619 --> 02:26:54.520]  Okay.
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:55.401]  The immediate assumption...
[02:26:55.481 --> 02:26:56.122]  No, no, no, no.
[02:26:56.122 --> 02:26:58.363]  We're not safer when you take our guns, jackass.
[02:26:58.363 --> 02:27:00.785]  We're not safer by changing a cosmetic feature.
[02:27:00.785 --> 02:27:04.047]  It's like I said, if you had a... Let me tell you about a cosmetic feature.
[02:27:04.047 --> 02:27:04.587]  I agree with you.
[02:27:04.587 --> 02:27:04.988]  Okay, alright.
[02:27:04.988 --> 02:27:05.508]  I agree with you.
[02:27:05.508 --> 02:27:06.449]  And that's just stupid.
[02:27:06.449 --> 02:27:07.730]  We've had a very colorful conversation.
[02:27:07.730 --> 02:27:08.790]  I've got to catch up with my crew.
[02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:10.892]  Thank you for being man enough to talk to us.
[02:27:10.892 --> 02:27:12.013]  Appreciate you, bro.
[02:27:12.013 --> 02:27:12.413]  Alright.
[02:27:12.413 --> 02:27:14.174]  Hey, Jakar, let me say something about that guy.
[02:27:14.174 --> 02:27:15.075]  He is the classic...
[02:27:18.692 --> 02:27:22.857]  I disagree with almost everything that man just said, but I respect him for staying here and debating with us.
[02:27:34.912 --> 02:27:37.694]  You heard the guy, he's like, well, what does Nazi Germany have to do with it?
[02:27:37.694 --> 02:27:39.255]  I said, okay, what about in Connecticut?
[02:27:39.255 --> 02:27:45.480]  What about in New York, where they're doing these bans, where you have to either turn in your rifle, destroy your rifle, or they can come and take it from you.
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:46.260]  He's like, well, that's New York.
[02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:51.904]  I was like, well, okay, let's talk about Austin, Texas, where Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez said he wants to make the gun ban legitimate.
[02:27:51.904 --> 02:27:52.925]  Well, that's one person.
[02:27:52.925 --> 02:27:58.629]  So every time we bring up the argument, he has some counter argument to diminish this and talking about Obama.
[02:27:59.145 --> 02:28:12.131]  Uh, you know, Obama said in the debates, as I told the gentleman, that he wants to take away AK-47s, he wants to take away things, cheap handguns, and he also hid behind Dianne Feinstein and said he would roll with anything Feinstein said she wanted to do.
[02:28:12.131 --> 02:28:18.134]  So, essentially, he is, if not supporting the government, he's at least content to let Dianne Feinstein take your gun.
[02:28:18.134 --> 02:28:18.314]  Sure.
[02:28:18.314 --> 02:28:20.235]  Jakari, let me ask you this question.
[02:28:20.235 --> 02:28:24.297]  It looks like, from who we've talked to, almost everybody's pro-gun down there except that guy.
[02:28:24.297 --> 02:28:27.879]  How many people have, I mean, what's the percentage of people you've talked to that are anti-?
[02:28:28.319 --> 02:28:38.646]  The first guy I met who was blatantly anti-gun, we met some people who were indifferent one way or the other, but that was the first guy I met who was just blatantly anti-gun, but I do respect him for standing here and debating with us.
[02:28:38.646 --> 02:28:41.968]  Sure, but his denial was disgusting though.
[02:28:41.968 --> 02:28:47.111]  Yeah, it was pretty amazing Alex, and now I think we've actually lost our ground.
[02:28:47.111 --> 02:28:49.593]  That's alright, we'll try to catch up to these guys here in a little bit.
[02:28:49.978 --> 02:28:50.439]  Absolutely.
[02:28:50.439 --> 02:28:54.127]  We got the feet up there with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:28:54.127 --> 02:28:55.831]  And there she is.
[02:28:55.831 --> 02:28:57.995]  Leanne McAdoo, give us your take on what's going on.
[02:28:58.855 --> 02:29:00.296]  Well, it's pretty surprising.
[02:29:00.296 --> 02:29:07.220]  Most people, obviously, a lot of people stopping to take pictures, a lot of people trying to find out what we're doing here, but most people are pretty impressed.
[02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:09.801]  And they're like, wow, welcome to Texas.
[02:29:09.801 --> 02:29:12.363]  And it's like, this is actually nationwide.
[02:29:12.363 --> 02:29:16.405]  Well, Leanne, I think what's happening is that mic, that external mic, is not activated.
[02:29:16.405 --> 02:29:19.927]  So we're going to go to break, let you guys work on getting that external mic activated.
[02:29:20.487 --> 02:29:34.051]  And then we're going to come back on the other side briefly with you guys and then get some other important news covered here that we've not gotten to yet that's been breaking up at places like Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:29:34.051 --> 02:29:38.292]  Folks, Bloomberg is going nationwide trying to restrict, register, and ban most guns.
[02:29:38.292 --> 02:29:40.773]  Their open goal is the abolition of guns.
[02:29:40.773 --> 02:29:44.154]  They are training the police as an internal illegal army to take our guns.
[02:29:44.154 --> 02:29:48.435]  We have to force a debate about this to show that it's illegitimate and criminal to stop it.
[02:29:48.435 --> 02:29:50.116]  They want to grow their plan in the dark.
[02:29:50.356 --> 02:29:51.819]  We're not gonna let him do it.
[02:29:51.819 --> 02:29:55.245]  We are engaging the enemy in a full war and smashing them!
[02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:03.471]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:30:03.471 --> 02:30:07.133]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:30:07.133 --> 02:30:11.656]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:30:11.656 --> 02:30:17.780]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:28.566]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:30:28.766 --> 02:30:35.253]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:30:35.253 --> 02:30:49.988]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands.
[02:30:50.128 --> 02:30:50.268]  I think?
[02:31:07.321 --> 02:31:14.644]  Cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:14.644 --> 02:31:16.585]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:16.585 --> 02:31:18.226]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:18.226 --> 02:31:22.908]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:22.908 --> 02:31:27.110]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:29.671]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:29.671 --> 02:31:35.574]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:01.127 --> 02:32:03.969]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:32:03.969 --> 02:32:09.111]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:32:09.111 --> 02:32:17.216]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:32:17.216 --> 02:32:21.758]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:32:21.758 --> 02:32:25.560]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:31.664]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:32:31.664 --> 02:32:34.826]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:32:34.826 --> 02:32:40.210]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[02:33:15.806 --> 02:33:25.569]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:33:25.569 --> 02:33:29.871]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:29.871 --> 02:33:34.512]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.512 --> 02:33:38.774]  Days grow shorter and the nights are getting longer.
[02:33:38.774 --> 02:33:42.235]  Feels like we're running out of time.
[02:33:45.541 --> 02:33:51.185]  Yeah, very beautiful words in this song.
[02:33:51.185 --> 02:33:57.570]  Gotta have some other bands redo it.
[02:33:57.570 --> 02:34:02.073]  Turn it up a little bit.
[02:34:02.073 --> 02:34:03.574]  Our enemy is weak.
[02:34:03.574 --> 02:34:12.240]  That's why they always want to say they don't want to fight us, while they attack us.
[02:34:16.272 --> 02:34:18.493]  Standard enemy operations.
[02:34:18.493 --> 02:34:21.434]  Standard military operations.
[02:34:21.434 --> 02:34:25.376]  And that's why they say, we're not coming for your guns.
[02:34:25.376 --> 02:34:26.536]  There's no drones.
[02:34:26.536 --> 02:34:27.777]  There's no NSA.
[02:34:27.777 --> 02:34:28.797]  There's no tyranny.
[02:34:28.797 --> 02:34:37.761]  The IRS is taking old ladies' houses by the thousands this week.
[02:34:37.761 --> 02:34:38.982]  Hundreds of thousands every year.
[02:34:41.581 --> 02:34:47.405]  They're taking foster kids and doing medical experiments on them and it comes out in the news and nobody gets in trouble.
[02:34:47.405 --> 02:34:53.630]  They're giving kids inoculations that don't protect them and brain damage them on record and kill them.
[02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:57.113]  They are committing so many forms of covert tyranny.
[02:34:57.113 --> 02:35:00.055]  Then they've got their minions who are part of the system.
[02:35:00.055 --> 02:35:06.880]  That guy that Ja'kari talked to, I don't think he's an evil person or a bad person, but he thinks he's part of the power structure because he's a reasonable guy.
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:08.402]  He thinks the system is reasonable.
[02:35:09.181 --> 02:35:15.883]  He is a helpless, pathetic, weak-minded, dangerous jellyfish.
[02:35:15.883 --> 02:35:20.304]  Because in this republic, he can vote to take my rights away.
[02:35:20.304 --> 02:35:23.685]  Because this republic is no longer a republic.
[02:35:23.685 --> 02:35:30.727]  It is a democracy where two wolves and a sheep can vote on what's for dinner.
[02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:39.641]  Now there's been some new developments and I want to get Anthony Gucciardi in here in a little while.
[02:35:39.641 --> 02:35:45.183]  We set that up earlier and I don't know if he remembers before the show I told him I wanted him to pop in.
[02:35:45.183 --> 02:35:49.184]  So let's go run around the building and find him as quickly as possible.
[02:35:49.184 --> 02:35:56.526]  Because I saw the article up on InfoWars.com and it reminded me that I wanted him on at 1.30.
[02:35:56.526 --> 02:35:58.287]  The article is Victory, Connecticut.
[02:35:59.602 --> 02:36:02.864]  Cops suspended after calls for home gun confiscation.
[02:36:02.864 --> 02:36:05.906]  At first they were going to suspend the guy that exposed it.
[02:36:05.906 --> 02:36:20.895]  Now it looks like, this is breaking, because I wanted to report on what was happening this morning and now I guess he went and looked into it and found that a Connecticut police officer was suspended this week after vile reports exposed his public defense of door-to-door gun confiscation.
[02:36:20.895 --> 02:36:25.498]  So they were going to suspend the other people involved before telling the truth.
[02:36:25.498 --> 02:36:26.659]  Now they've suspended the other guy.
[02:36:26.659 --> 02:36:28.140]  So that's really good, good, good news.
[02:36:29.025 --> 02:36:31.906]  But that's because the system doesn't want to stir everybody up.
[02:36:31.906 --> 02:36:37.247]  The average cop doesn't want to confiscate guns and knows that guns in law-abiding citizens' hands lower crime.
[02:36:37.247 --> 02:36:41.128]  You heard cops we talked to today in Austin.
[02:36:41.128 --> 02:36:43.968]  They don't want to have a debate, the politicos above this.
[02:36:43.968 --> 02:36:47.329]  They don't want us to force out the debate the military is being trained to take our guns.
[02:36:47.329 --> 02:36:52.570]  They don't want to force the debate that special paramilitary police are being trained to confiscate guns openly.
[02:36:52.570 --> 02:36:56.231]  Because then there'll be a debate about it, I know this is elementary, and then we will win!
[02:36:57.071 --> 02:37:00.352]  That's why they have to continue to deny, deny.
[02:37:00.352 --> 02:37:03.874]  What's the famous Bill Clinton quote about when he would get caught cheating and stealing and raping?
[02:37:03.874 --> 02:37:05.214]  He'd say, deny, deny, deny.
[02:37:05.214 --> 02:37:06.675]  In fact, there was a tape of it.
[02:37:06.675 --> 02:37:08.756]  All you do is you just deny, deny, deny.
[02:37:08.756 --> 02:37:10.877]  It doesn't matter if they got you on video doing it.
[02:37:10.877 --> 02:37:12.658]  You just deny, deny, deny.
[02:37:12.658 --> 02:37:13.618]  There's no NSA.
[02:37:13.618 --> 02:37:14.878]  There's no Solyndra.
[02:37:14.878 --> 02:37:16.379]  There's no Benghazi.
[02:37:16.379 --> 02:37:17.680]  There's nothing going on.
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:19.080]  Nothing happening.
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:20.341]  And then he's a swindler.
[02:37:21.212 --> 02:37:41.878]  He takes 53%, last time I checked last month, of the hundreds of millions of dollars his filthy charity brings in for little black kids worldwide, you know, Haiti and places, and then he spends it on wide-body jet aircraft fleet, basically, multiple jets, lavish apartment complex, you know, apartments he lives in, penthouses, and paying for his life!
[02:37:43.928 --> 02:37:44.789]  I don't have a charity.
[02:37:44.789 --> 02:37:47.052]  I don't have some kind of political 501c3.
[02:37:47.052 --> 02:37:53.520]  I probably should, and do like the Salvation Army, spend 90% of it actually on the charity, and 10% pay for administrative.
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:59.988]  You don't have to spend, you know, 40% of your money paying to the Federal Reserve, wasting money you bring in to fund the operation, then you gotta pay taxes on it.
[02:37:59.988 --> 02:38:01.410]  We should set up a tax-exempt arm.
[02:38:02.233 --> 02:38:03.934]  And have our books be public.
[02:38:03.934 --> 02:38:10.760]  Because, notice the IRS trying to stop libertarian groups and patriot groups and pro-life groups from having any tax exemption.
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:13.683]  Because if we all go do that, it's over for them.
[02:38:13.683 --> 02:38:17.946]  That makes them have 40% more money out of the gates than patriot groups.
[02:38:17.946 --> 02:38:20.408]  Because we don't go get tax exemptions.
[02:38:20.408 --> 02:38:22.250]  We're like, oh, we're not going to game the system like that.
[02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:24.612]  We've got to, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:24.612 --> 02:38:25.552]  I think I'm going to do it.
[02:38:25.552 --> 02:38:28.415]  I'm going to get with the lawyers and create a tax exempt arm.
[02:38:29.602 --> 02:38:31.563]  Why should I give 40% of the money comes in here?
[02:38:31.563 --> 02:38:39.627]  I mean, when I buy equipment around here, I have to pay taxes on it.
[02:38:39.627 --> 02:38:43.189]  I mean, I've had years where I didn't pay myself last year.
[02:38:43.189 --> 02:38:48.491]  Last year, I lost money because I wanted to put into expansion and crew.
[02:38:48.491 --> 02:38:49.672]  Why just put more money in the bank?
[02:38:49.672 --> 02:38:52.013]  And I have some money there for backup to fund stuff.
[02:38:52.013 --> 02:38:55.095]  Run the place three or four months if we ever got totally shut down by something.
[02:38:55.095 --> 02:38:56.475]  That's not very much emergency backup.
[02:38:56.475 --> 02:38:57.656]  That's like quarter tank.
[02:38:57.656 --> 02:38:59.197]  You're going on a big road trip.
[02:38:59.197 --> 02:38:59.317]  But
[02:39:00.979 --> 02:39:03.120]  I'm just thinking, why not play their game?
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:06.121]  Because only they're allowed to really be tax exempt with all their operations.
[02:39:06.121 --> 02:39:11.304]  Can you imagine if I had some charity that raised enough money to have a jet, and I wasn't given it to the little black kids?
[02:39:11.304 --> 02:39:14.545]  Bill Clinton could be destroyed with this information.
[02:39:14.545 --> 02:39:25.410]  The reason I bring Bill Clinton back up is that that criminal, with his criminal wife, we're going to be hearing, oh, you're against her because she's a woman and a lesbian.
[02:39:25.410 --> 02:39:27.451]  Give me a break.
[02:39:27.451 --> 02:39:28.452]  What a distraction.
[02:39:30.182 --> 02:39:32.003]  Can you imagine a woman being attracted to her?
[02:39:32.003 --> 02:39:34.305]  I mean, she's like a demonic snapping turtle.
[02:39:34.305 --> 02:39:36.086]  I don't mean to get off into that.
[02:39:36.086 --> 02:39:37.868]  It's just disgusting.
[02:39:37.868 --> 02:39:39.209]  I mean, I would not walk.
[02:39:39.209 --> 02:39:42.531]  I would run from Hillary Clinton.
[02:39:42.531 --> 02:39:43.712]  And I don't mean to get off into that.
[02:39:43.712 --> 02:39:45.933]  I mean, it's now reported that she's got a string of girlfriends.
[02:39:45.933 --> 02:39:47.254]  We already knew that.
[02:39:47.254 --> 02:39:51.177]  Hillary is even more of a sex-crazed addict than Bill Clinton.
[02:39:51.177 --> 02:39:54.880]  I mean, she makes the Wolf of Wall Street look tame in comparison to the reports I've been getting.
[02:39:57.734 --> 02:40:07.680]  So, getting serious Anthony, before we go back on the street with Jakari Jackson and Leanne McAdoo on the Second Amendment case, this story we broke with Mikkel Thelen three days ago has become viral.
[02:40:09.053 --> 02:40:11.234]  And is in the Connecticut News.
[02:40:11.234 --> 02:40:14.715]  A lot of stuff's gone back and forth in this.
[02:40:14.715 --> 02:40:15.355]  Boil it down.
[02:40:15.355 --> 02:40:16.576]  Quantify it for people.
[02:40:16.576 --> 02:40:19.217]  Your video reports on Infowars.com for radio listeners.
[02:40:19.217 --> 02:40:19.677]  Exactly.
[02:40:19.677 --> 02:40:21.758]  So we put out this exclusive report.
[02:40:21.758 --> 02:40:25.879]  There was a police officer from Connecticut who went out and reached out to us.
[02:40:25.879 --> 02:40:29.701]  We contacted him in this exclusive interview, in a text-based interview at first.
[02:40:30.581 --> 02:40:40.245]  And he's talking about a police officer in the area who said he would do anything pretty much to go and kick down people's doors to confiscate guns, that he would like to do it to this guy.
[02:40:40.245 --> 02:40:43.626]  This guy was actually former Navy, I'm sorry, in the beginning, who contacted us.
[02:40:43.626 --> 02:40:47.028]  So he was talking about a local police officer who wanted to confiscate weapons.
[02:40:47.028 --> 02:40:49.209]  And this was after the call in Connecticut.
[02:40:50.069 --> 02:40:52.211]  After Sandy Hook to actually go around and start, you know.
[02:40:52.211 --> 02:40:55.414]  And there's a video of other police and firefighters that say they've talked to the same guys.
[02:40:55.414 --> 02:41:11.127]  Yeah, so they were saying this is rampant in the police force and that orders from the, you know, top are saying assault weapons are bad and everything and many cops are going into a frenzy now blaming gun owners for Sandy Hook and saying they can't wait to take their guns from home to home, you know, confiscation kicking down doors.
[02:41:11.127 --> 02:41:13.629]  Which is now happening if you don't register they confiscate.
[02:41:13.809 --> 02:41:14.609]  Yes, exactly.
[02:41:14.609 --> 02:41:19.292]  So, we did this saying, look how insane this is, not even really promoting it.
[02:41:19.292 --> 02:41:20.773]  In fact, it was my fault.
[02:41:20.773 --> 02:41:24.855]  McKyle wrote this story doing a great job and I didn't even really promote it.
[02:41:24.855 --> 02:41:29.277]  And then I wake up the next morning and it said 18,000 shares just on Facebook.
[02:41:29.277 --> 02:41:32.039]  So it went super major viral, like beyond viral.
[02:41:32.039 --> 02:41:32.960]  That was just on StoryLeak.
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:34.781]  It's even higher on InfoWars.
[02:41:34.781 --> 02:41:36.181]  And then... StoryLeak.com.
[02:41:36.181 --> 02:41:38.923]  Yeah, my website and it's also up on InfoWars.com.
[02:41:39.523 --> 02:41:50.326]  And then I started hearing, you know, McConnell was texting me over and over, hey, the police force is responding now, officials are responding, I'm getting messages, you know, they're putting him on leave, they're investigating it.
[02:41:50.326 --> 02:41:54.927]  All of this from one piece, and this is now major national news.
[02:41:54.927 --> 02:42:01.209]  And it highlights not just the fact that he was put on leave, that's great and everything, that's nothing, there's an internal investigation on this guy, but it's not about him at all.
[02:42:01.209 --> 02:42:03.090]  It's not about attacking this individual.
[02:42:03.090 --> 02:42:07.531]  It's about attacking the attack on our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:42:07.551 --> 02:42:21.862]  Look, if they want to form an army of cops for gun confiscation, A, it's unconstitutional, B, it's out of control, C, man, I'm not looking forward to the Civil War it's going to start, and that's what they've geared up for, is to go from Al-Qaeda to Patriots, but they're going to lose.
[02:42:21.862 --> 02:42:24.124]  It's going to go offensive once they start the fight.
[02:42:24.124 --> 02:42:25.065]  No, because you think about it.
[02:42:25.065 --> 02:42:26.306]  I mean, I don't want this!
[02:42:26.306 --> 02:42:29.989]  I mean, literally, I'm out here saying you better watch it.
[02:42:30.734 --> 02:42:39.731]  The system wants the two Chinese or Siamese fighting fish to kill each other so Soros and the globalists can come in after the wreckage and reorganize the country.
[02:42:39.731 --> 02:42:40.894]  That is the plan.
[02:42:40.894 --> 02:42:41.835]  To make Obama
[02:42:43.376 --> 02:42:47.120]  We don't want them, but they are taking them for safety.
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:49.822]  No, they don't take them, except they do take them.
[02:43:06.243 --> 02:43:08.724]  Well, the cop has... The NSA's not a problem.
[02:43:08.724 --> 02:43:09.264]  We're slaves.
[02:43:09.264 --> 02:43:10.984]  If the cop has it, that's okay.
[02:43:10.984 --> 02:43:12.404]  Those are the type of people that are for this.
[02:43:12.404 --> 02:43:15.525]  And no wonder we're beating them back over and over again, the real media succeeding.
[02:43:15.525 --> 02:43:21.367]  This is a message of... Yeah, it's a bunch of coward chicken necks following criminal globalists who are weak, don't have moral high ground.
[02:43:21.367 --> 02:43:22.867]  If we just stand up, it's over!
[02:43:22.867 --> 02:43:23.267]  Exactly.
[02:43:23.267 --> 02:43:24.967]  I mean, I'm sick of these people!
[02:43:24.967 --> 02:43:27.308]  I will not be ruled by a bunch of chicken neck scum!
[02:43:27.648 --> 02:43:32.870]  And it's like you were saying, the real liberals, though, that aren't like that guy, that actually have some foundation, they're like, no, I actually like guns.
[02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:34.150]  You know, Second Amendment's good.
[02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:36.411]  That guy's a complete weasel.
[02:43:36.411 --> 02:43:45.054]  And there's so many people like him, it's actually- We've been down there, myself, you, and others doing reports, and you saw Jakari, one person out of hundreds was anti-gun that he talked to.
[02:43:45.054 --> 02:43:49.255]  I mean, these are like people going, I'm liberal, but I bought guns and I like your show.
[02:43:49.255 --> 02:43:50.616]  What does that mean?
[02:43:50.616 --> 02:43:53.817]  And I go, I mean, it's literally women, men, black, white, all guns.
[02:43:54.437 --> 02:43:55.918]  He's like, why do I like you?
[02:43:55.918 --> 02:43:59.539]  Because they identify... Because they want freedom!
[02:43:59.539 --> 02:44:00.960]  Because you're not a chicken neck!
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:05.162]  They identify with liberalism because they think it's cool, but they're actually on the real media side.
[02:44:05.162 --> 02:44:07.143]  They're on the real third party of reality side.
[02:44:07.143 --> 02:44:12.065]  They just don't know that because they want to be cool with their friends still who are trendy, and they want to identify as liberal.
[02:44:12.065 --> 02:44:13.466]  That's basically what it is.
[02:44:13.466 --> 02:44:18.888]  And they don't like Obama, but some of their friends think he's cool because he makes funny jokes on television, so they think he's funny.
[02:44:18.888 --> 02:44:19.789]  You know what I mean?
[02:44:19.789 --> 02:44:21.890]  There's a world better than those Republicans!
[02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:22.930]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:22.930 --> 02:44:32.953]  And the Republicans are bad people, but they'll still identify and say, yeah, I actually like the Second Amendment, the Constitution, I actually like liberty, but oh, no, I'm not into any of that weird conservative stuff or any of that.
[02:44:32.953 --> 02:44:36.294]  And the truth is, if they want to be Democrats, they should go take the Democrats over.
[02:44:36.294 --> 02:44:36.754]  Yeah.
[02:44:36.754 --> 02:44:38.474]  And make it more like them.
[02:44:38.474 --> 02:44:41.795]  The truth is, the establishment has Democrats and Republicans under their control.
[02:44:41.795 --> 02:44:44.216]  The only shot we've got is taking over the Republican Party.
[02:44:44.216 --> 02:44:45.816]  And we've got a shot at it!
[02:44:45.816 --> 02:44:46.096]  That's right.
[02:44:46.096 --> 02:44:47.737]  We are so screwed if we don't do that.
[02:44:47.737 --> 02:44:48.757]  It's going to be civil war.
[02:44:49.477 --> 02:44:55.603]  Maybe not this year, maybe ten years down the road, maybe five years, but I mean, it's all, the world financial meltdown is starting.
[02:44:55.603 --> 02:44:57.125]  They're going to try to get the guns before that.
[02:44:57.125 --> 02:44:58.126]  They can't.
[02:44:58.126 --> 02:45:00.848]  They're trying to start wars so they have the political high ground.
[02:45:00.848 --> 02:45:05.934]  The people are primitively, well, you know, after the terrorists hit us, Obama said turn the guns in, I guess we had to.
[02:45:06.667 --> 02:45:08.208]  Well it reminds me of the Alamo.
[02:45:08.208 --> 02:45:11.972]  All of the people with the massive weaponry walking around holding it open carry.
[02:45:11.972 --> 02:45:13.213]  It was an open carry march in Alamo.
[02:45:13.213 --> 02:45:14.274]  We were both there.
[02:45:14.274 --> 02:45:19.519]  All those people were really nice and willing to talk on camera and everything and were really centered and interesting.
[02:45:19.519 --> 02:45:22.742]  And then we go over to like the three people who were against guns.
[02:45:22.742 --> 02:45:24.503]  The moms against freedom.
[02:45:24.503 --> 02:45:25.905]  You know, guns.
[02:45:25.905 --> 02:45:27.106]  And they were attacking you.
[02:45:27.106 --> 02:45:30.449]  The guy was like smacking his wife and telling you to punch him in the face.
[02:45:30.629 --> 02:45:31.509]  No, they were starting fights.
[02:45:31.509 --> 02:45:40.694]  The only ones there that wanted to confiscate guns, the only ones there, were running up to you, pushing you, trying to fight us, and calling us idiots, and yelling at us.
[02:45:40.694 --> 02:45:43.536]  And then they always have news articles, the mean Alex came and did things.
[02:45:43.536 --> 02:45:44.916]  Came and harassed them.
[02:45:44.916 --> 02:45:47.598]  When in reality, they were trying to fight random people.
[02:45:47.598 --> 02:45:48.538]  It wasn't even just us.
[02:45:48.538 --> 02:45:50.939]  Like, they were just going up and bucking up against people.
[02:45:50.939 --> 02:45:52.940]  And those are the only ones that... Well, we had it on video.
[02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:55.021]  They're against violence, though.
[02:45:55.021 --> 02:45:59.804]  And then I thought there was more than three people, so there's all these big guys behind them, and I was like, fine, all of you, you want to hit me, go ahead.
[02:46:00.564 --> 02:46:01.786]  And I bet you got a gun on you.
[02:46:01.786 --> 02:46:02.666]  We'd already put the guns in the truck.
[02:46:02.666 --> 02:46:04.288]  I'm like, no, I don't use it.
[02:46:04.288 --> 02:46:06.851]  And then I found out those guys were actually our people there.
[02:46:06.851 --> 02:46:07.612]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:07.612 --> 02:46:09.674]  The crazed wife is actually trying to stop me.
[02:46:09.674 --> 02:46:11.897]  He starts, like, smacking her on camera.
[02:46:11.897 --> 02:46:12.938]  And you're like, hey, you shouldn't do that.
[02:46:12.938 --> 02:46:14.059]  He's like, yeah, I could fight you.
[02:46:14.059 --> 02:46:15.821]  And she's like, yeah, he could beat you up.
[02:46:15.821 --> 02:46:17.162]  He's like a 65-year-old man.
[02:46:17.162 --> 02:46:18.844]  We're like, hey, we don't really want to fight you.
[02:46:18.844 --> 02:46:20.446]  If he were to hit me, though, I was going to...
[02:46:20.814 --> 02:46:21.755]  Break his nose.
[02:46:21.755 --> 02:46:24.616]  Yeah, but the thing is, that's defense.
[02:46:24.616 --> 02:46:26.057]  This is actually a parable.
[02:46:26.057 --> 02:46:31.940]  Because defensively, legal firearms, someone comes in your house and starts punching you in the face, you know, you can use your legal firearm.
[02:46:31.940 --> 02:46:37.484]  But the criminals, who are actually the anti-gun people, want to use the violence to offensively attack.
[02:46:37.484 --> 02:46:40.065]  Well no, look how they're running around saying get rid of free speech everywhere.
[02:46:40.065 --> 02:46:42.366]  Exactly, and that guy's like, they're not doing that.
[02:46:42.366 --> 02:46:44.328]  We're not banning anything.
[02:46:44.328 --> 02:46:46.449]  Trying to ban the word bossy, they're not doing that.
[02:46:47.634 --> 02:46:50.119]  They're trying to ban everything.
[02:46:50.119 --> 02:46:53.425]  People say that's outrageous to have Michelle Obama come out and say we're going to ban the word bossy.
[02:46:54.892 --> 02:46:56.133]  People go, that's outrageous.
[02:46:56.133 --> 02:46:59.734]  It's meant to be over the top, because if they can get away with that... Exactly.
[02:46:59.734 --> 02:47:01.916]  If they're at level 10, then they can succeed at level 8.
[02:47:01.916 --> 02:47:06.478]  So basically, if they have total insanity, they might be able to pass by with crazy.
[02:47:06.478 --> 02:47:13.542]  So if ban the word bossy is too much, well, maybe we should ban, you know, the word, you know, Nazi or something like that, because everyone hates the word Nazi.
[02:47:13.542 --> 02:47:14.382]  You know what I mean?
[02:47:14.382 --> 02:47:18.164]  And then it's like, well, maybe we should ban the word, you know, anything.
[02:47:18.164 --> 02:47:22.566]  It could go, it could go, it's a slippery, slippery slope, as they would say, but it's beyond that.
[02:47:22.566 --> 02:47:23.086]  It's all 1984 style.
[02:47:24.301 --> 02:47:35.787]  And you can see the video right now where this crazed anti-gun guy who wants to confiscate your firearms is going up to Alex randomly because we're over there asking him questions, trying to fight him and saying, come on, hit me!
[02:47:35.787 --> 02:47:39.890]  And there's a part, it might have passed, where the wife tries to stop him and he like smacks her away.
[02:47:39.890 --> 02:47:42.551]  Yeah, we had already showed that.
[02:47:42.551 --> 02:47:43.091]  That's enough.
[02:47:43.091 --> 02:47:43.892]  I think that guy's more like 70.
[02:47:43.892 --> 02:47:45.533]  Some of these people are 70.
[02:47:45.533 --> 02:47:47.534]  He was literally trying to get me to hit him.
[02:47:47.534 --> 02:47:49.515]  I was like, dude, don't hit me, man.
[02:47:51.019 --> 02:47:55.003]  Actually, it's like ridiculous.
[02:47:55.003 --> 02:48:02.871]  Here they are, saying they're against violence, having some sob story, which is horrible, whatever, about their relative dying from something.
[02:48:02.871 --> 02:48:06.735]  But they were saying, oh yeah, we're against violence, we want to take guns.
[02:48:06.735 --> 02:48:07.156]  Now hit me.
[02:48:07.156 --> 02:48:11.921]  It's like those women out there today, they're like, we're against the violence of any type, and I said, what about defensive?
[02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:19.903]  They don't have facts or foundations or statistics or logic.
[02:48:19.903 --> 02:48:25.365]  So instead, they basically use talking points they heard on CNN like six years ago that they kind of muddily remember.
[02:48:25.365 --> 02:48:26.246]  So they don't really know.
[02:48:26.246 --> 02:48:29.367]  So when you ask them a question, they just use like, well, you can hunt.
[02:48:29.367 --> 02:48:31.449]  You know, they don't actually know anything.
[02:48:31.449 --> 02:48:35.811]  If you ask those people, in fact, you should ask them how many people die a year from assault weapons.
[02:48:36.431 --> 02:48:38.113]  How many people die a year from rifles?
[02:48:38.113 --> 02:48:39.274]  And they're going to say like 10,000.
[02:48:39.274 --> 02:48:40.435]  From assault weapons it's like 200.
[02:48:40.435 --> 02:48:45.259]  Yeah, it's like 300 now or something like that.
[02:48:45.259 --> 02:48:50.104]  2% of crimes with guns are with assault weapons.
[02:48:50.104 --> 02:48:58.212]  The DHS put out a memo last year saying, warning the police officers to stop focusing on mass shootings because there's none of them.
[02:48:58.812 --> 02:49:00.373]  And that's all internal.
[02:49:00.373 --> 02:49:01.593]  They know it's a total hoax.
[02:49:01.593 --> 02:49:04.214]  Well, the memo came out and we did an article on it.
[02:49:04.214 --> 02:49:08.096]  It was like 30 people a year die from mass shootings on average or less and it's not a big deal.
[02:49:08.096 --> 02:49:11.937]  They're saying you're ignoring thousands from these rapes and homicides.
[02:49:11.937 --> 02:49:14.378]  It's 167, 168 but then almost all those are gangbangers.
[02:49:14.378 --> 02:49:16.639]  It was like five gangbangers shooting at five gangbangers.
[02:49:17.099 --> 02:49:18.160]  They call that a mass shooting?
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:20.781]  No, they were saying the gangbangers are the issue.
[02:49:20.781 --> 02:49:24.843]  And to go after the actual real crime, and they were telling the cops, please stop wasting your time on this.
[02:49:24.843 --> 02:49:25.984]  People are dying.
[02:49:25.984 --> 02:49:31.167]  They had to issue an internal memo because so many people were obsessed with the mass shootings.
[02:49:31.167 --> 02:49:33.508]  That it was actually diverting their attention from real crime.
[02:49:33.508 --> 02:49:35.429]  Something's going on here with Leanne.
[02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:37.030]  Good job, Anthony Guicciardi.
[02:49:37.030 --> 02:49:40.872]  Leanne, what are you doing out there with your come and take it Molon Labe?
[02:49:40.872 --> 02:49:44.534]  Made in America, Infowars, store.com, awesome shirt.
[02:49:45.404 --> 02:49:47.685]  I'm trying to make liberty trendy.
[02:49:47.685 --> 02:49:54.909]  I am out here showing these people that freedom is trendy and exercising your rights is very trendy.
[02:49:54.909 --> 02:50:00.032]  I'm trying to get some people, you've got everyone just kind of standing there with their mouths gaping open.
[02:50:00.032 --> 02:50:02.133]  So I'm going to try and get some bystanders.
[02:50:02.133 --> 02:50:06.495]  Now that guy in the red hoodie looks like a complete space cadet.
[02:50:06.495 --> 02:50:08.136]  Go talk to him.
[02:50:08.136 --> 02:50:09.077]  Okay.
[02:50:09.077 --> 02:50:10.758]  I shouldn't be, but he's probably a listener.
[02:50:10.758 --> 02:50:11.638]  Go talk to him.
[02:50:17.112 --> 02:50:20.274]  Oh, he's ultra-trendy.
[02:50:20.274 --> 02:50:21.314]  Ultra-trendy.
[02:50:21.314 --> 02:50:22.054]  No camera.
[02:50:22.054 --> 02:50:24.896]  Even though there's cameras everywhere.
[02:50:24.896 --> 02:50:30.118]  They're okay with mass surveillance, but they don't want... They're just scared when a woman comes over to them.
[02:50:30.118 --> 02:50:30.799]  That was the trick.
[02:50:30.799 --> 02:50:32.800]  Those guys, they probably only play Second Life all day.
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:38.643]  And when an actual woman comes stomping over to them, they get a little intimidated there.
[02:50:38.643 --> 02:50:39.123]  Real life.
[02:50:42.220 --> 02:50:59.606]  Oh man, I tell you what, stay there Leanne, we're going to come back to you with a final report on the gun rally to take back Texas from the pig demon, the son of Al Gore, ManBearPig, the Al Gore dropping, Mayor, I'm going to get your guns while I have a bodyguard, because I'm a big fat gangster Bloomberg.

[02:54:27.043 --> 02:54:32.544]  And, uh, the trendies from California that have already helped bring down their state are now invading the South by Southwest.
[02:54:32.544 --> 02:54:37.005]  They're renaming the South by Southwest to Planet Dumbass.
[02:54:37.005 --> 02:54:38.766]  And it's been discovered in Austin, Texas.
[02:54:38.766 --> 02:54:40.806]  It happens two weeks out of the year.
[02:54:40.806 --> 02:54:44.487]  There's actually a lot of smart people down there, though, and Leanne McAdoo is down there.
[02:54:44.487 --> 02:54:46.127]  Where are you downtown, McAdoo?
[02:54:46.127 --> 02:54:47.968]  Looks like you found some real trendies in that area.
[02:54:48.410 --> 02:54:54.153]  Yes, we are at the corner of 6th and Trinity right now, kind of right at the tail end of 6th Street.
[02:54:54.153 --> 02:54:55.633]  So 6th and Trinity.
[02:54:55.633 --> 02:54:59.935]  Walking into the wilderness, the wild, wild west out here.
[02:54:59.935 --> 02:55:03.057]  I wanted to find out what you guys think about all these guns out here.
[02:55:03.057 --> 02:55:03.937]  Guns?
[02:55:06.997 --> 02:55:10.681]  I think it's pretty crazy.
[02:55:10.681 --> 02:55:13.564]  I mean, I see the chick showing her tits, more boobs.
[02:55:13.564 --> 02:55:14.285]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:14.285 --> 02:55:15.406]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[02:55:15.406 --> 02:55:17.908]  More boobs, you know, less guns, and it's pretty crazy.
[02:55:17.908 --> 02:55:26.357]  It's pretty intense, but I mean, I think it's a great place to actually protest how you feel and, you know, tell people, I mean, everyone from all over Texas is here, all over the world, and it's protesting here.
[02:55:26.357 --> 02:55:28.619]  It's pretty cool, and I think it makes sense.
[02:55:29.480 --> 02:55:30.121]  Yeah.
[02:55:30.121 --> 02:55:32.142]  Good, so you're not frightened.
[02:55:32.142 --> 02:55:34.784]  You guys are all about Second Amendment rights.
[02:55:34.784 --> 02:55:36.105]  Very good.
[02:55:36.105 --> 02:55:43.310]  What do you think all these people from California think about Texas when we're out here exercising our rights?
[02:55:43.310 --> 02:55:43.810]  I don't know.
[02:55:43.810 --> 02:55:45.812]  They think we're crazy, but I mean, it's like
[02:55:46.927 --> 02:55:49.789]  It's way different culture and lifestyles from California to Texas.
[02:55:49.789 --> 02:55:52.291]  So you can't compare our lifestyles and the way we live.
[02:55:52.291 --> 02:55:53.752]  California is way crazier.
[02:55:53.752 --> 02:55:56.054]  Like, I mean, we might think they're crazy at certain things.
[02:55:56.054 --> 02:55:58.035]  You know, they can't, we can judge all we want.
[02:55:58.035 --> 02:55:59.996]  California used to be more pro-gun than Texas.
[02:55:59.996 --> 02:56:01.978]  It's two different lifestyles.
[02:56:03.439 --> 02:56:03.879]  Exactly.
[02:56:03.879 --> 02:56:06.802]  Well, the lefties plan on moving here.
[02:56:06.802 --> 02:56:08.604]  They better be ready to try and come.
[02:56:08.604 --> 02:56:11.807]  You know, they may not be able to turn it into a blue state like they want.
[02:56:11.807 --> 02:56:14.150]  We are going to recruit them.
[02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:17.513]  I'm telling you, you take a commie out, have them shoot.
[02:56:17.513 --> 02:56:20.576]  I'm telling you, it really works, Leanne.
[02:56:20.576 --> 02:56:21.317]  It's liberating.
[02:56:23.772 --> 02:56:26.133]  Hey, let's do some product placement to pay the bills, Leanne.
[02:56:26.133 --> 02:56:27.693]  Show folks that awesome shirt.
[02:56:27.693 --> 02:56:28.894]  That is the gold foil shirt.
[02:56:28.894 --> 02:56:29.494]  It's sold out.
[02:56:29.494 --> 02:56:30.915]  More came in this week.
[02:56:30.915 --> 02:56:38.157]  It is the women's cut, Molon Lambe in Greek up at the top, and then on the back, Infowars.com, the Spartan helmet.
[02:56:38.157 --> 02:56:43.019]  No one's got a Molon Lambe shirt that awesome, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:43.019 --> 02:56:43.519]  Nobody.
[02:56:43.519 --> 02:56:44.940]  We have the best designed by
[02:56:45.580 --> 02:56:48.122]  Yours truly, and the great graphics department put my ideas together.
[02:56:48.122 --> 02:56:51.924]  That's an Alex Jones design, made in 1776.com, made in America.
[02:56:51.924 --> 02:56:54.386]  You can find it at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:56:54.386 --> 02:57:03.713]  We have the men's shirts as well, and we will sell out at current sales rates in the next two days in the Super Mill Vitality because of all the rave reviews you've been hearing, and it may be as much as a month.
[02:57:04.912 --> 02:57:09.914]  Till more of it comes in, because we take so hard to get the wet herbs and then concentrate them.
[02:57:09.914 --> 02:57:12.054]  It really is a long process and very expensive.
[02:57:12.054 --> 02:57:25.719]  So if you want the Supramel Vitality, it is available right now on the sale ends today, 15% off InfoWars4.com or go right to the supplement section at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:35.664]  In my experience, there's no other male enhancement supplement for just healthiness to block the estrogen mimickers.
[02:57:35.664 --> 02:57:38.185]  And women are too high on estrogen, too, according to all the medical reports out there.
[02:57:38.185 --> 02:57:39.986]  That's why women really go wild on this.
[02:57:39.986 --> 02:57:41.307]  Leanne, I don't even know.
[02:57:41.307 --> 02:57:41.987]  I haven't asked you.
[02:57:41.987 --> 02:57:44.169]  Have you taken Supramel Vitality yet?
[02:57:44.169 --> 02:57:54.675]  I took a couple of drops there for the first week or so, and... I don't know if I want to give my testimony right now.
[02:57:54.675 --> 02:57:56.776]  No, no, no, but I mean, is it a real product?
[02:57:56.776 --> 02:57:57.777]  It's definitely real.
[02:57:58.729 --> 02:58:01.110]  It definitely works immediately.
[02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:02.830]  We'll just put it that way.
[02:58:02.830 --> 02:58:06.411]  Anyways, the whole point is... Alright Leanne, thank you very much.
[02:58:06.411 --> 02:58:07.771]  Great job down there.
[02:58:07.771 --> 02:58:10.572]  God, guns, guts, and Wonder Woman.
[02:58:10.572 --> 02:58:12.213]  Thank you so much Leanne McAdoor.
[02:58:12.213 --> 02:58:13.573]  Who's doing the nightly news tonight?
[02:58:13.573 --> 02:58:16.554]  Is it you, Knight, or Jakari?
[02:58:16.554 --> 02:58:17.594]  Tonight will be Jakari.
[02:58:17.594 --> 02:58:20.675]  Alright, and then... Yeah, Jakari Jackson.
[02:58:21.328 --> 02:58:26.172]  And then Fridays are McAdoo Fridays, right?
[02:58:26.172 --> 02:58:26.973]  Absolutely.
[02:58:26.973 --> 02:58:29.796]  Tuesdays and Fridays with Miss McAdoo.
[02:58:29.796 --> 02:58:30.757]  7 o'clock central.
[02:58:32.099 --> 02:58:34.121]  With Leanne McAdoo tonight.
[02:58:34.121 --> 02:58:35.943]  Ja'Kari Jackson, InfoWars.News.
[02:58:35.943 --> 02:58:37.104]  Look, I'm out of time.
[02:58:37.104 --> 02:58:38.666]  Great transmission for Liberty.
[02:58:38.666 --> 02:58:39.987]  God bless you all.
[02:58:39.987 --> 02:58:41.709]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:41.709 --> 02:58:46.193]  There's a March Saturday, our March Saturday, and I may be hopping in.
[02:58:46.193 --> 02:58:48.335]  I just don't like to steal the show, though.
[02:58:48.335 --> 02:58:49.877]  I love seeing other people out there winning.
[02:58:49.877 --> 02:58:51.959]  More Liberty, more freedom, more liberty.
