[00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.750]  Let's go to our reporters and then to the callers.
[00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.890]  Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs join us.
[00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.611]  I guess Jakari's on the line first.
[00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:18.771]  Oh, Joe Biggs is on first.
[00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:19.212]  Thank you.
[00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:23.153]  Joe Biggs in front of the courthouse there outside Ferguson.
[00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:24.173]  He's at the county seat.
[00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:33.095]  What's the new intel you've got there during the Arctic Al Gore warming extravaganza on the verdict there in Missouri?
[00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:35.516]  It's quite shocking.
[00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:39.397]  I expected global warming to be a lot warmer.
[00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:42.653]  It's 18 degrees, but I guess that's another subject.
[00:00:42.673 --> 00:00:50.539]  Well, if you paid Al Gore more carbon tax money, and the Rothschilds more money on their exchange, then we'd be better off, you racist!
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.945]  Well, yeah, we're standing right outside of what they call the Justice Center, and we have CBS News, Fox News right over here.
[00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:03.409]  Everyone's still awaiting a word to find out when the verdict's gonna come out.
[00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.130]  I have someone on the inside who's gonna
[00:01:05.535 --> 00:01:09.157]  Shoot me a text when that comes, uh, when that information's put out.
[00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:09.657]  Well done.
[00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:12.999]  I do have, I do have some, uh, some other big information as well.
[00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:19.002]  I just got the location of the command center where the military and DHS is.
[00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:23.804]  So after we get off here, we're going to go out there and investigate that, get footage and shoot a report.
[00:01:24.044 --> 00:01:26.305]  I've already seen some footage from a local.
[00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:27.406]  He sent me a little bit.
[00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:29.256]  And, uh, it looks legit.
[00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:30.397]  It's pretty big.
[00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:32.458]  So we're gonna go out there and do a report on that.
[00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:35.620]  But those guys look like they're, uh, well stocked up and ready.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:51.831]  But, you know, one of the funny things is, is, you know, I sat down and, uh, had some lunch a little bit ago when I, you know, the, the restaurant had Fox News on and it's showing all these pictures of stuff in August where everyone's out in the street and it makes it look, they're portraying like there's this huge war.
[00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:55.393]  There's like constant chaos going on in, uh, the St.
[00:01:55.413 --> 00:01:57.715]  Louis surrounding areas, Ferguson, Clayton.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:12.918]  All these areas and right now it's so cold no one's out you know yesterday there was maybe a 20 minute protest and the headline was protesters stormed courthouse we were out there there's no protesters stormed any courthouse whatsoever so it seems like
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.121]  The government wants chaos.
[00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:15.861]  They want blood.
[00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:16.641]  They want riots.
[00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:19.002]  The mainstream media is feeding that fear.
[00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:33.409]  They want complete and total collapse, so then again they can instate their martial law, bring in the National Guard, and have, you know, people with soldiers with weapons, cops everywhere in riot gear walking up and down the streets once again.
[00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.122]  Elaborate on any intel you're getting.
[00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:43.366]  I mean, still no word on when they're going to either indict or not indict the police officer?
[00:02:44.107 --> 00:02:44.547]  Not yet.
[00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:48.731]  I mean, at any point, I mean, it would make sense to do it now when it's freezing cold.
[00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:58.120]  I mean, anybody you see walking down the street, they're going from their car and they're running indoors as fast as possible because it is not a pleasant, you know, it's not pleasant to be outside whatsoever.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.622]  So, I mean, now you would think would be the time
[00:03:01.263 --> 00:03:05.767]  To release that information, going ahead and let it get out there, and let people eventually just calm down.
[00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:09.970]  Instead, they're going to wait, it's going to warm up, and it's going to turn into August all over again.
[00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.350]  That's right.
[00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:18.076]  I would announce it at like 5 in the morning, so that the word goes out, you know, the gangbangers and people are asleep until later in the day.
[00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.499]  Regular, hard-working folks aren't going to, you know, go out and tear anything up.
[00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:22.500]  They're going to go out and demonstrate.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.260]  Great, that's their right.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.881]  We support it.
[00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:26.403]  And, you know, that's their right to do that.
[00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:28.204]  A lot of folks fought for that right.
[00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:30.026]  It's a God-given right, not from the state.
[00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:35.991]  But, and then you'd have all day to see if anything formed to be able to deal with any violence.
[00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:40.595]  Instead, I got a feeling they'll announce it some night at about 7, right at dark.
[00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:44.219]  Because the whole way they've been running this is to try to get it going.
[00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:50.931]  Well, once we see what this command center's up to, we'll know if they're mobilizing, getting ready to push into this area or not.
[00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:56.555]  Because I think that's what the governor's waiting on for their, you know, strategic placement of these guys.
[00:03:56.935 --> 00:04:07.344]  So when they do announce it and they do put it out, they've got their, you know, their pawns in position for ultimately what we think will happen will be complete and total utter chaos happening out here in the streets.
[00:04:07.644 --> 00:04:12.728]  But it's so cold right now, you're not going to have a lot of people running up and down the road protesting for longer than 30 minutes.
[00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:14.069]  I mean, it's pretty frigid.
[00:04:15.114 --> 00:04:31.025]  Well, expanding on that, Homeland Security, CNN, now report on what we covered back on Sunday with you guys live on air, and that's that this fella shot video of the DHS vehicles and photos, put it up on the internet, and they got him fired.
[00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:40.151]  So be careful when you go videotape the command base, but I would just be out in the open because I've noticed if you sneak around then they think that means you're bad.
[00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:44.113]  What are you planning when you go to this federal command base?
[00:04:44.153 --> 00:04:52.038]  Because I mean I want to be here obviously by the phone or by the Skype with you guys feeding us a live Skype feed in case they try something with you.
[00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.040]  Yeah, it's where we're at now in Clayton.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.861]  I just looked it up on the maps.
[00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.222]  It's about a 20-minute drive.
[00:04:58.732 --> 00:04:59.793]  South of where we're at now.
[00:04:59.853 --> 00:05:03.537]  It's behind a gas station in what looks like a pretty open area.
[00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:13.928]  So I was thinking about setting up in the field across the street at first just to get some footage and then push it a little bit closer and then see if I can get some up close stuff.
[00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:19.072]  You know, I'm pretty sure the way they're acting, like with the DHS, how they, you know, got that guy fired.
[00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:20.674]  Someone's gonna come up and approach us.
[00:05:20.994 --> 00:05:25.277]  And that's fine, I mean... Well, that's huge news if they try to stop you doing what you're supposed to do.
[00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:28.619]  Well, they're not going... I mean, they can try, but I know my rights.
[00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:32.362]  I'm gonna go up there and I'm gonna film, because that's my God-given right.
[00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:33.409]  That's right.
[00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.370]  Once you get there, Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson, call Rob, dude.
[00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.150]  Call the office.
[00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.791]  Even though we won't be live or on the air until night at 7 o'clock central with the nightly news.
[00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:50.252]  But let's have you Skype back live to us so we can capture that in case they try something.
[00:05:50.272 --> 00:05:51.052]  Okay.
[00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:57.253]  Because, I mean, you already had one cop run up and say, you know, I'll effing kill you with a shotgun for no reason.
[00:05:57.933 --> 00:05:59.334]  By the way, he was suspended.
[00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:01.114]  Did we ever find out what happened to him?
[00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.733]  Um, I haven't heard anything new from that, from what you just said, as well.
[00:06:06.093 --> 00:06:06.733]  So I'm not sure.
[00:06:06.813 --> 00:06:08.335]  I can find that out here pretty soon, though.
[00:06:08.355 --> 00:06:11.977]  I know a lot of the, uh, the people are starting to show up that were here back in August.
[00:06:12.017 --> 00:06:15.520]  I know some of them have kept in touch with that, so I can find that out pretty quickly.
[00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:17.632]  All right, well, just take a moment.
[00:06:17.652 --> 00:06:21.054]  Let's get Jakari in front of the camera, and then I'll get his take on anything.
[00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:22.395]  Joe, thank you so much.
[00:06:22.776 --> 00:06:24.937]  That's Joe Biggs, thank you, up there reporting.
[00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:27.819]  And they're going to be there live when the verdict comes down.
[00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:33.022]  And so even if we're not live on the air or on the nightly news at the time, there will be a live feed.
[00:06:33.062 --> 00:06:37.965]  They'll call Kit Daniels or Adon Salazar or Kurt Nemo or...
[00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:53.805]  Mikel Thelen or Anthony Gucciardi, any of the writers, and we will have that live Ustream feed up for you so you can see what's happening there on the ground at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:06:53.825 --> 00:07:02.908]  And if we find out the verdict's happening and there are riots or any issues, we will expand InfoWars Nightly News tonight and I'll even come back.
[00:07:04.853 --> 00:07:08.135]  Uh, and, uh, do live coverage because this could spread around the country.
[00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:12.138]  I hope the cold weather keeps it from getting violent.
[00:07:12.478 --> 00:07:17.202]  But the way the media's hyped it, it's almost like they're trying to put the idea in people's minds.
[00:07:17.242 --> 00:07:19.563]  Jakari, what do you think about the situation?
[00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:22.305]  Uh, I have to echo what Joe says.
[00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:27.529]  You know, I'm eager to get out here and check out this, uh, command center they have, uh, posted up a little bit south of here.
[00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:33.253]  But like you said, for the time we're out here from the Justice Center, this is where we saw our protests and our rallies yesterday.
[00:07:33.746 --> 00:07:41.252]  It's been pretty cold, not a whole lot of people are frequently in the area, just the normal business people that live and work in this area.
[00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:43.954]  But yes, we do see a huge buildup.
[00:07:44.014 --> 00:07:47.257]  Governor Nixon has said that he's ready to mobilize the National Guard.
[00:07:47.858 --> 00:07:52.421]  So I would expect that they are planning to announce the verdict here pretty soon.
[00:07:52.942 --> 00:07:54.083]  What's going to happen after that?
[00:07:54.143 --> 00:07:58.786]  You know, this would be the best time to announce it as far as I'm concerned if they don't want a lot of people in the streets.
[00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:01.729]  You know, it's ungodly cold out here.
[00:08:02.617 --> 00:08:04.701]  Uh, it's going to warm up a little bit later this week.
[00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:10.011]  I think tomorrow is supposed to get around 50 or so, but at the moment it's about 18, uh, 17 degrees.
[00:08:10.372 --> 00:08:13.759]  So if they want to do it, this would be the ideal time to minimize the people in the streets.
[00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:22.629]  I think from a lot of different angles, the Feds are trying to provocateur a big event to get more funding and federalize things more.
[00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:26.210]  The fact that they haven't announced the verdict yet when it's cold and should.
[00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:29.692]  If they announce it at night, I find that very, very suspicious.
[00:08:31.133 --> 00:08:34.034]  What's your gut on what's overall happening?
[00:08:34.634 --> 00:08:35.635]  I mean, who are the good guys?
[00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:36.575]  Who are the bad guys?
[00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:39.397]  In your heart, Jakari, what do you think is really going on here?
[00:08:40.337 --> 00:08:45.360]  Well, I do agree that, you know, they would like to see a huge spectacle of force, you know.
[00:08:47.208 --> 00:08:54.992]  To come out here in the big MRAPs and all that stuff, you know, it's not really justifiable to come out with all the big heavy armor and the military vehicles.
[00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:58.754]  Just like we saw in Boston, you know, for one fugitive, a total power grab.
[00:08:59.234 --> 00:09:02.495]  Yeah, you know, you have one guy who's running around hiding in somebody's boat.
[00:09:02.856 --> 00:09:05.937]  So, you know, they need SWAT teams going door to door, drawing people out.
[00:09:05.977 --> 00:09:07.558]  And they said, well, we didn't force anybody out.
[00:09:07.758 --> 00:09:10.239]  You just stuck a gun in their face and asked them to please leave their premises.
[00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:14.141]  Yeah, I'm sure most people would walk out of the house and under those circumstances.
[00:09:14.485 --> 00:09:19.409]  So yeah, I think if they wanted to minimize the damage or potential damage, they would release it now.
[00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.193]  But, you know, if it gets warmer outside, you'll have more people out in the streets.
[00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:42.229]  But what I think is going to happen, the reasoning behind this, you know, when we were here originally back in August, we were talking to some of the people, even a local minister, and she said to me in big, she's like, I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but I think they're out here letting some people loot and everything because you guys remember the command base we showed you last time?
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:48.944]  That was at a shopping center that was right down the street from where all the chaos happened, where they burned down the gas station and all that.
[00:09:49.344 --> 00:09:55.848]  And, you know, these guys were pretty much sitting on their hands as some of the more lucid things were going on in the area.
[00:09:55.868 --> 00:10:02.192]  But when you have peaceful people, a largely peaceful crowd, then they come out with the MRAPs aiming guns at people in the crowd.
[00:10:02.793 --> 00:10:05.294]  And, you know, you aim a gun at anybody, it's going to get them fired up.
[00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:10.858]  So then, you know, you have more people come out and some people are more prepared to do more radical actions.
[00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.518]  They just, you know, stand there and peacefully protest.
[00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:22.142]  And then they lied, Zachari, and said that they weren't shooting tear gas at you, even though you picked up a canister, and even though Joe, I mean, you guys showed rubber bullets all over the ground.
[00:10:22.182 --> 00:10:23.122]  Joe got hit by them.
[00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:26.063]  I mean, it's just the level of lying is the problem.
[00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:36.588]  The level of lying, my favorite one besides the tear gas and even the rubber bullets, you know, we reported day one on that Tuesday that they had pretty much installed a curfew.
[00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.849]  And then the next day, the police chief, I believe it was Jackson, he comes out.
[00:10:40.314 --> 00:10:41.114]  There's no curfew.
[00:10:41.154 --> 00:10:43.155]  We're just, you know, showing up at 6 p.m.
[00:10:43.215 --> 00:10:46.195]  aiming guns at people and threatening to arrest them if they don't get off the street.
[00:10:46.255 --> 00:10:47.075]  That's not a curfew.
[00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:49.276]  I guess that doesn't constitute a curfew.
[00:10:49.336 --> 00:10:51.216]  Even though they had publicly announced it.
[00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:58.138]  Again, it's the lying by government discredits police when at first we were kind of like, yeah, these looters are bad.
[00:10:58.438 --> 00:11:01.719]  Looks like the police are trying to maintain order the first few days.
[00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:03.219]  We weren't being negative to the police.
[00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:07.801]  They were doing a pretty good job, then they started attacking reporters and leaving looters alone.
[00:11:08.582 --> 00:11:10.563]  Just very, very sad.
[00:11:10.883 --> 00:11:15.446]  Jakari Jackson, we will continue to watch and listen to your coverage and the special reports.

[00:11:40.417 --> 00:11:41.498]  Twenty people now!
[00:11:42.198 --> 00:11:43.118]  We have the bandwidth.
[00:11:43.438 --> 00:11:44.579]  We can do it.
[00:11:45.199 --> 00:11:47.240]  Like the bionic man, we can rebuild him.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.340]  Stronger, faster, better.
[00:11:49.397 --> 00:11:56.858]  You can go there and get a membership that 20 people can use to be part of true grassroots media and watch these live transmissions.
[00:11:57.098 --> 00:11:58.319]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:04.520]  I tell you folks, we're talking about Obama right now.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.280]  He's the front man for all this.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:12.121]  And we've got Obama supporters calling in who seem like nice folks, but they're like, well, I'm going to check into it.
[00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:13.061]  I don't know if I believe you.
[00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:16.262]  Gruber is telling you that they're devils.
[00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:18.182]  Listen to the song.
[00:12:23.737 --> 00:12:25.577]  Talk like an angel.
[00:12:26.778 --> 00:12:28.258]  They're telling you, though.
[00:12:30.258 --> 00:12:31.879]  They're in red pajamas.
[00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:33.979]  They're not in disguise.
[00:12:35.219 --> 00:12:36.999]  That's how much disdain they have for you.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.100]  I don't.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.120]  I know when you dumb other people down and screw other people over, it comes back on you.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.261]  Yeah.
[00:12:46.281 --> 00:12:49.842]  We're in a little bit of overdrive, too, so I get to everybody.
[00:12:49.962 --> 00:12:50.442]  Michael and
[00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:55.068]  Bill, Barbara, Rick, and Daniel.
[00:12:55.088 --> 00:12:55.588]  That'll be it.
[00:12:56.988 --> 00:13:02.129]  Before we go any further, again, we're going to sell out of Survival Shield, Nason I9X2.
[00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:06.611]  We are going to sell out of the B12.
[00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:14.032]  Unfortunately, very, very quickly, we had another shipment of it that came in because they'd overproduced.
[00:13:14.052 --> 00:13:17.413]  They had an overage, but that is going to sell out within a matter of days.
[00:13:17.893 --> 00:13:19.294]  DNA force, all of it.
[00:13:19.314 --> 00:13:21.254]  And when it's sold out, who knows how long it'll take.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.006]  You take up to six weeks.
[00:13:23.026 --> 00:13:24.092]  I hope that's not the case.
[00:13:24.977 --> 00:13:26.598]  DNA Force took 16 weeks.
[00:13:26.838 --> 00:13:28.319]  Occupower, 6-7 weeks.
[00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:33.162]  We've got more of the Oxy Powder in, discounted with promo code N-O-W.
[00:13:34.122 --> 00:13:35.403]  5% off stuff that's already discounted.
[00:13:35.963 --> 00:13:37.004]  Occupower's back in.
[00:13:37.064 --> 00:13:38.605]  Silver Bullet's back in next week.
[00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:46.089]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:48.910]  Give family a bottle of the special B12.
[00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.971]  Give family a bottle of the X2.
[00:13:51.352 --> 00:13:51.932]  Lung cleanse.
[00:13:52.152 --> 00:13:53.173]  The stuff's so good,
[00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.715]  That they'll be, wow, I want more of that.
[00:13:55.815 --> 00:13:58.577]  And you can help them get healthy and support this transmission.
[00:13:58.597 --> 00:14:00.199]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:05.904]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:14:06.925 --> 00:14:09.267]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Florida.
[00:14:09.627 --> 00:14:10.168]  You're on the air.
[00:14:10.188 --> 00:14:13.270]  I know you've been holding to talk to Dent, but I had to finish up with the other people.
[00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.631]  Go ahead.
[00:14:14.204 --> 00:14:15.745]  It's alright, Alex.
[00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:22.408]  What I wanted to see you do is actually make a film called Living the Contradiction, you know, instead of Living the Dream.
[00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:26.510]  Because a lot of these politicians, they kind of contradict what they're doing.
[00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:33.393]  And my question for Dent was, where do you think this country's money is going after the holidays?
[00:14:33.453 --> 00:14:40.477]  Because I think just like the tradition of the last couple presidents, they had several different crises going out of office.
[00:14:41.571 --> 00:14:46.336]  Um, so I think the money, you know, didn't spend on different things like that.
[00:14:46.936 --> 00:14:48.578]  But that's pretty much my question.
[00:14:48.818 --> 00:14:49.719]  Oh, that's a great question.
[00:14:49.739 --> 00:14:51.101]  I wish we had him here to get his take.
[00:14:52.021 --> 00:14:53.183]  I think they'll start more wars.
[00:14:53.783 --> 00:14:56.686]  I think they'll pull some more crises, maybe a false flag terror attack.
[00:14:57.066 --> 00:15:00.570]  What do you think they're going to pull the Republicans and Democrats to divert us?
[00:15:01.909 --> 00:15:06.552]  Um, I think there's something, there's going to be something big with race.
[00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:20.201]  A lot of the racial tension in this country, I think they're trying to build off that as a distraction, you know, so people won't realize the big elephant in the room, which is still the high gas prices.
[00:15:20.681 --> 00:15:22.782]  I mean, it only comes down in certain places.
[00:15:23.143 --> 00:15:24.804]  The food is going to be out of reach.
[00:15:24.864 --> 00:15:27.825]  What they're gearing up for is really something big.
[00:15:29.126 --> 00:15:48.299]  I really want to hear from somebody who's been dealing with this political funk for the last couple of years because Clinton, going out of office, he passed a law that you couldn't be a group if you're not sanctioned by the government.
[00:15:59.106 --> 00:16:02.128]  Remember, the Republican leadership helped ride Obamacare.
[00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:03.810]  Romney endorsed Gruber.
[00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.051]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:09.193]  Everybody's sick of me saying, literally.
[00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:13.556]  Well, Time Magazine has people tweeting what words they want banned.
[00:16:14.517 --> 00:16:18.519]  Which is just an attempt to discuss banning things and literally is one of the top ones.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.922]  I'm really, I am literally trying to stop using the word literally.
[00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:32.387]  And I catch myself, literally, realizing that I'm actually using the word actually and literally too much.
[00:16:32.607 --> 00:16:32.987]  I get it.
[00:16:33.467 --> 00:16:39.711]  But instead of going, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I say literally, literally, literally.
[00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:46.437]  Or I see literally when I want to say that I'm not exaggerating or this isn't a figure of speech.
[00:16:48.137 --> 00:16:50.418]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to a few more calls.
[00:16:51.558 --> 00:16:52.738]  I'm literally going to them now.
[00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.939]  Bill in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:55.819]  Go ahead.
[00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:57.179]  What's up there, Alex?
[00:16:57.539 --> 00:16:58.519]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.660]  I'm doing good.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.600]  I want to thank you for saving my life.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:07.881]  Alex, your products have really returned my health to me, and I want to thank you for my health back.
[00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:08.982]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[00:17:09.042 --> 00:17:09.502]  What'd they do?
[00:17:09.522 --> 00:17:10.542]  I mean, what products were those?
[00:17:11.277 --> 00:17:18.180]  Well, I was taking some mental health medication that I probably should never have taken in my life because I was under attack.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.222]  Just like people across this country are under attack.
[00:17:21.722 --> 00:17:23.923]  And they were not reporting my blood work.
[00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:27.404]  And so I had like, pustules under my arms.
[00:17:27.424 --> 00:17:29.205]  My kidneys were hurting bad.
[00:17:29.245 --> 00:17:32.367]  I've been to the hospital for a whole year with backaches and pain.
[00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:35.008]  And my sides were distended.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.362]  So I quit taking the medication.
[00:17:37.382 --> 00:17:40.806]  I went to homeopathic remedies that do the same.
[00:17:41.587 --> 00:17:43.469]  And I started taking your products.
[00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:45.263]  And I was able to clean it out.
[00:17:45.343 --> 00:17:47.424]  The inflammation went down in my kidneys.
[00:17:47.444 --> 00:17:49.205]  I'm able to urinate now better.
[00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:50.105]  Awesome.
[00:17:50.165 --> 00:17:51.346]  My health has returned.
[00:17:51.426 --> 00:17:52.466]  I've lost some weight.
[00:17:52.526 --> 00:17:54.127]  The sores are all gone.
[00:17:54.527 --> 00:17:55.748]  My mind is clearer.
[00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:58.309]  And it's thanks to your products.
[00:17:58.449 --> 00:18:00.710]  And really, we're under attack out here.
[00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:01.290]  Oh, we are.
[00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.991]  I mean, look, if you don't have iodine, you die.
[00:18:03.011 --> 00:18:04.212]  You don't have B12, you die.
[00:18:04.472 --> 00:18:06.413]  And you go into the doctor and they won't tell you that.
[00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:14.300]  I have a medical doctor that actually took my blood and said what I needed years ago, and I'm working with him to get the key things I need.
[00:18:14.681 --> 00:18:19.405]  But the good news is more and more medical doctors are clicking, so it's good news.
[00:18:20.126 --> 00:18:21.948]  Yeah, we've got a domino effect happening.
[00:18:23.567 --> 00:18:25.770]  You know, the dominoes are rolling down right now.
[00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:31.898]  We've got the secret army over there pretending to be crazy Muslims and chopping off heads.
[00:18:32.519 --> 00:18:34.902]  And half of them aren't even from that country.
[00:18:34.922 --> 00:18:35.203]  Oh yeah.
[00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:41.071]  So it looks like this is mercenaries that have been hired and who printed up all that wonderful stuff for them to wear.
[00:18:41.861 --> 00:18:44.804]  And so they're over there creating a distraction.
[00:18:45.204 --> 00:18:53.952]  Our Army boys are getting their legs and arms blown off so that we can further, you know, do our science work on how we're going to one day repair legs and stuff.
[00:18:54.372 --> 00:19:06.443]  But they're being blown up while the other guys are loading drugs onto the aircraft for our wonderful African Americans up there in Ferguson after they go through their traumatic, distressing attack that may happen.
[00:19:07.043 --> 00:19:09.306]  And I think this attack is like Kent State.
[00:19:10.047 --> 00:19:12.950]  You go and you shoot these young hippies, and what happens?
[00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.712]  You increase drug abuse in that area.
[00:19:15.072 --> 00:19:16.494]  You increase depression.
[00:19:16.894 --> 00:19:21.359]  You increase the need for psychological help.
[00:19:22.743 --> 00:19:23.604]  And that's dependence.
[00:19:23.624 --> 00:19:25.565]  You create dependence through terror.
[00:19:25.986 --> 00:19:26.987]  And that's what we have up there.
[00:19:27.007 --> 00:19:28.988]  We have psychological terror going on.
[00:19:29.108 --> 00:19:29.569]  I agree.
[00:19:29.629 --> 00:19:32.451]  And even the average compartmentalized cop is not aware of it.
[00:19:32.491 --> 00:19:33.412]  You're awesome, sir.
[00:19:33.732 --> 00:19:34.572]  So many great callers.
[00:19:34.592 --> 00:19:37.054]  We don't have great callers all day, but great callers here at the end.
[00:19:37.074 --> 00:19:41.098]  I wish I could keep going, because I want to talk to Barbara and everybody else briefly.
[00:19:41.458 --> 00:19:46.141]  The New York Times says questions about Sharpton's finances accompany his rise in influence.
[00:19:46.802 --> 00:19:47.883]  Another FBI guy.
[00:19:48.443 --> 00:19:50.465]  And it turns out he basically doesn't pay taxes.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.624]  Now they may burn Sharpton now because he's no longer useful because Obama's going out.
[00:19:56.285 --> 00:19:56.485]  See?
[00:19:56.866 --> 00:19:57.226]  But no!
[00:19:57.747 --> 00:19:58.788]  Go after Google.
[00:19:58.828 --> 00:19:59.929]  Go after Microsoft.
[00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.292]  Go after General Electric where they don't pay taxes.
[00:20:02.792 --> 00:20:04.013]  And I'm not defending Sharpton.
[00:20:04.813 --> 00:20:07.515]  But, but see how they'll burn their people when they're done with them.
[00:20:07.935 --> 00:20:09.716]  Man, I tell you, I wouldn't want to be with the New World Order.
[00:20:10.597 --> 00:20:13.659]  Barbara, Daniel, Bob, and Rick, I'm sorry I'm out of time.
[00:20:13.699 --> 00:20:16.441]  I got a long way to go in a short time to get there.
[00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:21.604]  A lot of work to do, a lot getting ready for coverage tonight of whatever happens in Ferguson today or tomorrow.
[00:20:21.924 --> 00:20:23.145]  We're going to be here covering it.
[00:20:23.485 --> 00:20:27.848]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:27.868 --> 00:20:31.951]  I want to thank our sponsors, our affiliates, you, the listeners, the good Lord, everybody else.
[00:20:31.991 --> 00:20:34.393]  Let's pray for peace in Ferguson and other areas.
[00:20:35.194 --> 00:20:39.099]  Because it's the First Amendment under attack and they want to just play everybody off against each other.
[00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:43.986]  We need to come together and say no to looting and also no to police brutality.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.983]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:20:59.444 --> 00:21:09.169]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.232]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:21:13.792 --> 00:21:16.634]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:21:18.835 --> 00:21:25.058]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:21:25.358 --> 00:21:27.659]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:30.760]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:36.643]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:21:37.083 --> 00:21:43.748]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
