[00:00:10.492 --> 00:00:11.592]  The door's not locked.
[00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:15.214]  Inside, an officer confronts Gonzalez but is overpowered.
[00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.475]  Alarm boxes are near the front door.
[00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:21.556]  They're silenced because the White House staff complained they were too noisy.
[00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:26.178]  You see these kind of cosmetic, you know, air quotes you, optics issues all the time.
[00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:29.199]  Well, we don't want to bother the president, we don't want to bother the ushers.
[00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.260]  Well, do you want to keep him alive?
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.281]  The Director of the Secret Service has resigned.
[00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:41.165]  There have been multiple recent security breaches that have led up to this announcement, besides the White House fence jumper who made it well beyond the front door.
[00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:48.848]  It's being reported that the final straw was that an armed private contractor shared an elevator with the President at CDC headquarters.
[00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.850]  But that's not to say that the Secret Service isn't working.
[00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.439]  The Fox Brothers, who produced Conrad the Constitution, were visited by the service for making a cartoon that portrays the assassination of the President.
[00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.042]  Hey Chris, was I supposed to get the Columbian hookers tonight?
[00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:04.544]  I can't remember.
[00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:13.397]  Who knows nothing, Baldy!
[00:01:13.618 --> 00:01:16.480]  The brothers were eventually found not to be a threat.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.605]  Also, when the president came to the LBJ Museum in Austin, info wars went in hopes of getting in a question.
[00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:31.410]  Even though we went through the process of getting credentialed, we were informed that we weren't selected by the service to attend the president's address.
[00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.594]  We couldn't even get within several hundred yards of the presidential convoy to get decent footage.
[00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:39.316]  This is security theater at its finest.
[00:01:39.596 --> 00:01:45.381]  Crack down on the media and keep the reporters at bay, but someone can literally waltz into the White House.
[00:01:45.682 --> 00:01:49.185]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:56.624]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:06.777]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:02:07.117 --> 00:02:10.880]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:16.104]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:22.710]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
