[00:00:01.573 --> 00:00:14.945]  Aries Armor, a California gun parts manufacturer, has filed a temporary restraining order against the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for fears the federal agency could soon bust down its doors.
[00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:22.232]  What the ATF has determined time and time again is that there is five operations on the AR-15 receivers that need to be left
[00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:27.600]  Undone that still need to be milled by the customer in order for it to be considered not to be a firearm.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.521]  Here's the problem.
[00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:32.928]  A manufacturer has made one in plastic with different material and colors.
[00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:33.889]  This is plastic.
[00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:34.390]  This is metal.
[00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:37.739]  Which show the person building it exactly where to drill.
[00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:45.283]  Harry's Armor says the ATF is threatening to shut them down if they don't hand over some 5,000 names of people, customers.
[00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:49.625]  Show that to everyone who says registration doesn't lead to confiscation.
[00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:54.247]  The ATF demanding customer records of a product they don't approve of.
[00:00:54.727 --> 00:01:02.571]  We already see magazines being banned in parts of California and Connecticut and guns banned in New York based on cosmetic features.
[00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:13.406]  And on the other side of the ranch, the ATF ran guns into Mexico under Operation Fast and Furious, a fact that the Attorney General Eric Holder perjured himself about.
[00:01:13.797 --> 00:01:20.580]  Attorney General Eric Holder was sent briefings on the controversial Fast and Furious operation as far back as July 2010.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.502]  That directly contradicts his statement to Congress.
[00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:28.684]  Listen to what Holder told a Judiciary Committee hearing on May 3rd this year.
[00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:33.766]  I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks.
[00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:43.130]  Yet internal Justice Department documents show that at least 10 months before that hearing, Holder began receiving frequent memos discussing Fast and Furious.

[00:01:55.487 --> 00:01:58.729]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.071]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:09.556]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:02:09.857 --> 00:02:25.167]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[00:02:25.407 --> 00:02:25.747]  Let's do it!
