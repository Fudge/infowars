[00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:09.134]  Big Brother.
[00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:10.815]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:12.675]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:14.116]  You want answers?
[00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:15.797]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:16.437 --> 00:00:20.099]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.702]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:55.571]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you again so much for joining us on this live Thursday, July 3rd, 2014 worldwide transmission.
[00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:59.593]  I am your host Alex Jones, back in the saddle yet again.
[00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:02.494]  Again, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:22.159]  We're going to have Lord Christopher Monckton on with the latest big news on the carbon tax, global tax fraud that the globalists are pushing and how they're trying to get that agenda through and how they're trying to shut down free speech and some other breaking news that we'll disclose when he comes on with us.
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.642]  Then, Professor Daryl Hamamoto will be joining us, coming up from UC Davis.
[00:01:33.837 --> 00:01:55.475]  And the professor went public last week and contacted InfoWars.com via Paul Watson with the article Paul Watson then subsequently wrote, UC professor, immigration influx is about re-education of society and creating a new permanent underclass.
[00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:56.155]  See, that's the deal.
[00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:58.517]  They want to exploit these immigrants.
[00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:02.421]  I don't even dislike these immigrants overall, except for the
[00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:06.917]  Democratic Party vitriol that they're programmed with.
[00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:12.361]  That they deserve free welfare, vote to turn in the guns, the government's God.
[00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:17.824]  The government's bringing in a client group that will pliantly do whatever they're told.
[00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:18.745]  And I know you know that.
[00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:22.607]  But the general public knows something's going on, they don't know exactly what.
[00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:26.590]  We've got to get the truthful narrative out against the lying narrative.
[00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:31.053]  And boy is it getting crazy.
[00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:32.154]  When we come back from break,
[00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:44.246]  All hell is breaking loose as Obama signs this executive order and announces a bunch of other executive orders to basically legalize these illegals.
[00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:51.331]  He says that's how you fix the giant uncontrolled influx is put more of them on welfare, make more of them legal.
[00:02:52.912 --> 00:03:01.478]  That'd be like if someone wanted to stop getting fat, they would triple the amount of food they would eat.
[00:03:03.223 --> 00:03:09.767]  Or if you didn't want to die, you'd shoot yourself in the head at point-blank range with a double-lock buckshot with a 12-gauge.
[00:03:10.688 --> 00:03:13.289]  Or if you didn't want to bleed, you'd hack your fingers off with a hatchet.
[00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.711]  Come here, we'll pay for everything.
[00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:16.291]  It's free.
[00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.193]  Get on buses to the United States.
[00:03:18.713 --> 00:03:23.856]  We'll bus you deeper in and just drop you off, and the latest welfare office will take you in.
[00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:30.841]  And now they're reporting VA employees switched from processing VA applications to Obamacare applications.
[00:03:31.892 --> 00:03:39.914]  We actually put incoming applications aside so we could focus on the ACA-related applications that came in over last summer.
[00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:43.896]  That's the whistleblower quote from Fox News with Neil Cavuto.
[00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:52.978]  So, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and the rest of our reporters down there at the border kept pointing out that the VA is basically turning off services.
[00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:53.759]  It was already bad.
[00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.580]  It's now basically almost like a VA stand-down in many areas.
[00:03:58.407 --> 00:04:00.409]  And we said, wow, what's it going to the illegals?
[00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:02.210]  They get everything paid for.
[00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.974]  And a red carpet, but the veterans get nothing.
[00:04:06.754 --> 00:04:07.635]  Is this related?
[00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:16.122]  And it is now emerging a congressional testimony in closed-door hearings that that is exactly what's happening.
[00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:19.505]  And when the government wants to cover something up, that's what they do.
[00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:22.808]  Is they
[00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:29.268]  Have a closed-door hearing and then gag everyone that brings in the bombshell information.
[00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.651]  The good news is the whistleblowers are getting smarter about that.
[00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:33.872]  They're just going to the media.
[00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.313]  Whether that be old dinosaur media that'll tell the truth like Fox News, on some cases, or whether it's the true new media, the only real media.
[00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:44.273]  The real media versus the fake media.
[00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:46.774]  State-run media versus the people's media.
[00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:50.976]  The liberty-based, truth-based media versus the Decepticon media.
[00:04:51.716 --> 00:04:52.696]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:53.136 --> 00:04:55.217]  Geopolitical news, the latest on ISIS.
[00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:59.919]  BBC reporter says Google moving to suppress legitimate journalism, and more.
[00:05:02.338 --> 00:05:09.424]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:05:09.505 --> 00:05:11.666]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:16.951]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:22.076]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:25.337]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:29.479]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.921]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:43.985]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:46.766]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:55.016]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:59.121]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:06:03.243 --> 00:06:04.303]  In the near future.
[00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:08.745]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:10.106]  Security alert.
[00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:12.046]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:06:12.327 --> 00:06:12.947]  Analysis.
[00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:13.847]  InfoWars.
[00:06:13.927 --> 00:06:16.008]  Building independent media operations.
[00:06:16.028 --> 00:06:20.870]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.890]  Prime Directive.
[00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.411]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:26.272]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:26.332 --> 00:06:29.413]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:06:29.593 --> 00:06:31.754]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:06:32.054 --> 00:06:33.374]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:06:33.394 --> 00:06:35.775]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:37.876]  They're never going to stop.
[00:06:38.176 --> 00:06:42.057]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:06:42.217 --> 00:06:45.398]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:45.818 --> 00:06:48.479]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.919]  Imperative.
[00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:52.160]  Destroy Little Minute TV.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.581]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:06:56.741 --> 00:06:58.222]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:06:58.262 --> 00:06:58.982]  You can feel it.
[00:07:01.764 --> 00:07:03.645]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:11.648]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:12.028 --> 00:07:19.311]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:23.853]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:07:24.153 --> 00:07:34.338]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:07:34.798 --> 00:07:40.962]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:07:41.282 --> 00:07:43.523]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:07:43.543 --> 00:07:47.505]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:49.268]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[00:07:49.608 --> 00:07:53.554]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[00:07:53.775 --> 00:08:00.705]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:36.603]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:37.003 --> 00:08:39.344]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:58.643 --> 00:09:07.107]  One of the claims surrounding this illegal immigration influx is that the White House hasn't sent a clear message that it's not open season at the border.
[00:09:07.588 --> 00:09:16.712]  And over the weekend, Nancy Pelosi visited a border facility in Brownsville, Texas, and what she saw there prompted her to tug on the heartstrings of the American people.
[00:09:17.213 --> 00:09:23.276]  She says that we have a moral responsibility to help children that are crossing the southern border.
[00:09:24.056 --> 00:09:28.800]  What about these American children that are being treated like terrorists by the TSA?
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:36.567]  Here we have an 18-month-old and her family that were thrown off a flight because her name was on the no-fly list.
[00:09:37.228 --> 00:09:38.109]  Absolute terrorists.
[00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.511]  And then, you know, here just it goes on and on.
[00:09:40.551 --> 00:09:42.453]  We've got a girl that was in a wheelchair.
[00:09:42.513 --> 00:09:50.260]  She was headed to Disney World with her family and she was so traumatized by that experience that she told her family, I don't want to go to Disney World anymore.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.882]  Because we all just really enjoy getting patted down by the TSA as if we're the terrorists.
[00:09:56.303 --> 00:09:59.104]  Meanwhile, it's open season at the border.
[00:09:59.684 --> 00:10:06.927]  One of the things that Nancy Pelosi failed to mention is that some of these children are actually active gang members.
[00:10:07.287 --> 00:10:17.752]  Now, we've reported before about how border agents are saying that even if these children under 17 admit to actively being in gangs, even if they're covered in gang tattoos,
[00:10:18.112 --> 00:10:26.375]  They're ordered to release these known gang members into America as long as they don't have a current criminal record here in the U.S.
[00:10:26.895 --> 00:10:34.638]  Meanwhile, cops are using pre-crime techniques to detain American citizens who could possibly commit a crime.
[00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:40.862]  Pima County Sheriff's Department's MIST unit, the Mental Health Support Team, takes every threat seriously.
[00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:56.432]  And now, armed with everything known about a subject... Paranoid and delusional, not on their meds... A new Arizona law says the individual can be brought in voluntarily to a mental health crisis response center without a warrant or court order or visible evidence of danger.
[00:10:56.929 --> 00:10:57.909]  Are we preventing crime?
[00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:58.610]  I think we are.
[00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:04.333]  So anyone showing these warning signs can be involuntarily detained in a mental health facility.
[00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:13.857]  Meanwhile, if you have the warning signs of gang tattoos all over your body or you admit to being in a gang, that's not enough of a warning sign for you to be detained.
[00:11:14.357 --> 00:11:23.842]  Now, here's video of police throwing a female professor, college professor, to the ground and arresting her for illegally crossing the street.
[00:11:25.242 --> 00:11:35.288]  And here we show video exclusively shot by InfoWars showing busloads of illegal immigrants being given the VIP treatment for illegally crossing the border.
[00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:42.593]  So one of the biggest issues facing these unaccompanied illegal alien children is the dangerous journey ahead of them.
[00:11:42.633 --> 00:11:52.359]  They could be kidnapped, pulled into the sex trade, drug cartels, they could starve, dehydrate, catch any number of diseases, rape, murder.
[00:11:52.439 --> 00:11:54.140]  I mean, it's a dangerous journey.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:00.244]  Here, Breitbart News reports on the body of an 11-year-old child that was found in a border town.
[00:12:00.544 --> 00:12:08.709]  These kids, some are reportedly as young as three months old, are being sent on this dangerous journey by themselves, by their parents.
[00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:15.294]  Now imagine if parents here in America were, you know, showing the same kind of disregard for their children.
[00:12:15.794 --> 00:12:19.457]  Here we have a father in Hawaii who was sentenced to one year probation.
[00:12:19.477 --> 00:12:24.280]  He was given a $200 fine and he was also forced to take child parenting classes.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.260]  His crime?
[00:12:25.741 --> 00:12:33.566]  He forced his eight-year-old son to walk nearly a mile home from school because the boy refused to tell his father why he had been disciplined.
[00:12:33.706 --> 00:12:34.527]  Earlier that day.
[00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:36.689]  Well, the father wanted to teach him a lesson.
[00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:38.290]  He said, walk it off.
[00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.413]  And by the time you get home, you better have a better answer for me than that.
[00:12:41.874 --> 00:12:47.219]  Well, the judge ruled that that walking was just too severe of a punishment for this child.
[00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:49.701]  And the judge said, these are different times.
[00:12:50.142 --> 00:12:54.626]  It's dangerous for children to walk along the highway and there are predators out there.
[00:12:54.966 --> 00:12:58.748]  Walking was considered too severe of a punishment to inflict on a child.
[00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:08.272]  Now clearly, if the parents of these unaccompanied illegal minors were here in America, they'd be fined, they'd be arrested, they'd have their parental rights taken away.
[00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:11.914]  But instead, these children are given a bus ticket to
[00:13:11.994 --> 00:13:16.016]  Any town USA, and then they're going to serve as anchor babies for their families.
[00:13:16.356 --> 00:13:23.779]  And then when their families get here, rather than arrest them on the spot, they're going to be reunited promptly with their children.
[00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:33.042]  They're going to be given access to welfare, legal representation, and amnesty, which the Obama administration is reportedly planning to announce.
[00:13:33.382 --> 00:13:40.385]  It's going to issue executive action to give temporary amnesty and work permits to Dreamers parents as early as the fall.
[00:13:40.825 --> 00:13:48.413]  Now while the message the White House is sending to illegal aliens might be a little fuzzy, the message they're sending to the rest of America is quite clear.
[00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:53.057]  It's not hope and change for America, but for everybody else.
[00:13:53.738 --> 00:13:57.642]  Now you can find more reports like these at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:09.372 --> 00:14:10.472]  What's this mean?
[00:14:10.613 --> 00:14:12.013]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:14:12.313 --> 00:14:14.894]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:14:15.314 --> 00:14:21.597]  From FEMA Region 6 in Oculus.
[00:14:33.012 --> 00:14:34.254]  There is a war.
[00:14:34.714 --> 00:14:35.715]  It's happening now.
[00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:38.359]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:14:38.939 --> 00:14:40.762]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:14:41.523 --> 00:14:43.005]  We are the resistance.
[00:14:43.445 --> 00:14:47.971]  We are the Infowar.
[00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:49.813]  And on the eve of July 4th...
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.303]  1776 anniversary on July 3rd, 2014.
[00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:59.487]  I come to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:10.016]  If you want to see that video report, it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com after it aired a few nights ago on InfoWars Nightly News with
[00:15:11.764 --> 00:15:12.064]  Ms.
[00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:21.847]  Infowars herself, Leanne McAdoo, her reports, Darren McBrain reports, all the great reporters' reports, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, you name it, are up on Infowars.com.
[00:15:22.407 --> 00:15:38.092]  And what I really enjoy seeing, with a real sense of satisfaction, as we go up against this tyranny, is Leanne McAdoo's reports, Paul Watson's reports, Anthony Gucciardi's reports, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs' reports, and others, routinely,
[00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:45.725]  Kent Daniels reports on national television, national radio, international television and radio.
[00:15:45.885 --> 00:15:54.432]  Our reporters are now news sources all over the globe for dinosaur media and alternative new media and are kicking butt.
[00:15:55.313 --> 00:16:00.658]  And that's another testament to what you can do out there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:01.479 --> 00:16:02.399]  Most of these reporters
[00:16:04.008 --> 00:16:05.548]  Haven't even worked in mainstream media.
[00:16:05.568 --> 00:16:10.410]  McBrain worked for, what was it, Scripps Howard News Service on TV and print.
[00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.350]  Leanne's got a degree from UT, worked in television.
[00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:18.072]  But most of these folks are people that won contests, people like David Knight.
[00:16:18.092 --> 00:16:25.134]  And of course, he'd already been in media and an engineer and worked at a think tank in investigative journalism, but he was trained as an engineer.
[00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:30.295]  Look at what a great job they're doing just off people that entered a YouTube contest.
[00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:34.794]  And now you see them here.
[00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:36.916]  Changing the world.
[00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:44.585]  Just another example of the power of the individual working through free association with others.
[00:16:45.385 --> 00:16:47.628]  Absolutely dynamite.
[00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:49.930]  Dynamite.
[00:16:51.332 --> 00:16:52.473]  Liberty is sexy.
[00:16:52.954 --> 00:16:53.795]  Liberty is cool.
[00:16:54.932 --> 00:16:56.153]  Liberty is fun.
[00:16:56.913 --> 00:17:01.337]  Liberty is like fresh air compared to being drowned in a pit of lies.
[00:17:02.297 --> 00:17:03.898]  And we are here promoting it.
[00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:07.781]  We have serious biases around here to tell the truth.
[00:17:08.282 --> 00:17:09.783]  We get off on being honorable.
[00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:11.464]  We get off on not being cowards.
[00:17:13.746 --> 00:17:15.667]  We get off on going up against tyrants.
[00:17:15.687 --> 00:17:16.848]  It's that simple.
[00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:19.950]  And the establishment calls us a disease.
[00:17:22.832 --> 00:17:23.653]  I call us the cure.
[00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:27.504]  And we're into this animating contest.
[00:17:27.524 --> 00:17:28.305]  We're into this fight.
[00:17:29.946 --> 00:17:32.487]  Like, we've got to get that clip from Patton where he says, Americans!
[00:17:32.987 --> 00:17:34.168]  Americans aren't cowards!
[00:17:34.208 --> 00:17:35.348]  Americans love to fight!
[00:17:35.368 --> 00:17:38.770]  And then he just goes into that whole rant with George C. Scott.
[00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.231]  That's a real speech Patton gave.
[00:17:41.391 --> 00:17:46.574]  And it's time for the American spirit that tyrants worldwide have feared to be rekindled.
[00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:50.496]  And the tyranny that has possessed us, it's time for an exorcism.
[00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:53.758]  That's what America needs, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:55.234 --> 00:18:01.219]  Now, we are going to go to break, and I'm going to come back and get into all the news, and it's the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:18:01.339 --> 00:18:02.340]  It's just crazy.
[00:18:05.102 --> 00:18:06.483]  But here are just some of the headlines.
[00:18:06.963 --> 00:18:12.548]  VA employees switch from processing VA applications to Obamacare applications.
[00:18:12.588 --> 00:18:17.371]  We had already said that must be going on because the VA went from horrible to absolutely just the worst ever.
[00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.610]  Got a bunch of veterans work here.
[00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.430]  Got family that are vets.
[00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.151]  They said the VA was always bad.
[00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:25.231]  It is literal hell now at almost every facility.
[00:18:27.052 --> 00:18:28.712]  Continuing, HHS report.
[00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:34.073]  It looks like over a million Obamacare enrollees were illegal aliens.
[00:18:34.093 --> 00:18:35.854]  We're going to be getting into that.
[00:18:36.694 --> 00:18:39.414]  CDC ignores disease illegal crisis.
[00:18:39.935 --> 00:18:41.795]  Drudge carried this report yesterday.
[00:18:43.069 --> 00:18:44.731]  By Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:46.492]  And guess what?
[00:18:46.573 --> 00:18:48.234]  They responded today.
[00:18:48.254 --> 00:18:54.240]  The CDC responded within hours of the report going out on the number one news aggregator on the planet.
[00:18:54.761 --> 00:19:00.567]  CDC confirms activation of Emergency Operations Center in response to immigration influx.
[00:19:00.947 --> 00:19:06.255]  You can read that story at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and of course at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:09.659]  Right now we're going to be breaking that down as well today.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.121]  Let's get into this report.
[00:19:11.302 --> 00:19:15.307]  Smugglers threaten landowners in Cameron County.
[00:19:16.819 --> 00:19:20.980]  Yeah, folks, the Mexican Mafia threatens people here in Austin, Texas.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.261]  And I personally have been threatened repeatedly that I'll end up dead.
[00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:26.781]  And it didn't matter.
[00:19:27.081 --> 00:19:29.422]  I still went and made the reports and people went to jail.
[00:19:29.622 --> 00:19:30.902]  I'm not going to go into a whole talk about that.
[00:19:30.942 --> 00:19:31.802]  It's been in the newspaper.
[00:19:32.682 --> 00:19:33.783]  But that's just the way it is.
[00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:36.063]  And I mean, if somebody kills me, that's the way it is.
[00:19:36.163 --> 00:19:38.564]  I mean, what, you think I'm worried about the Mexican Mafia?
[00:19:38.904 --> 00:19:40.284]  I'm going up against the New World Order here.
[00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:41.524]  We're going to get into that.
[00:19:42.204 --> 00:19:44.485]  Continuing non-citizen driver's license.
[00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:50.495]  In Colorado, they'll fix the gun owners there that are recalling the gun grabbers.
[00:19:50.716 --> 00:19:52.037]  They're gonna let the illegal aliens vote.
[00:19:52.077 --> 00:19:52.878]  CBS News.
[00:19:53.678 --> 00:19:54.719]  Plan's pretty darn clear.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.244]  But members of Congress aren't allowed to see the illegal alien command bases.
[00:19:59.804 --> 00:20:00.785]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:01.246]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:03.559]  A sudden change in the wind.
[00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:10.181]  The day grows dark as ominous clouds move in and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky.
[00:20:10.521 --> 00:20:13.202]  And you realize you are not prepared.
[00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:18.683]  The number of intense storms is increasing exponentially in the U.S.
[00:20:18.963 --> 00:20:24.804]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts are happening with greater magnitude and frequency.
[00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:27.705]  If you are choosing to rely on the government to save your
[00:20:27.785 --> 00:20:29.227]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:20:29.367 --> 00:20:30.689]  You could be dead wrong.
[00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:36.077]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.

[00:20:50.191 --> 00:20:51.892]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:20:52.092 --> 00:20:55.674]  And speak to one of our preparedness advisors today.
[00:20:55.914 --> 00:20:59.196]  Remember, before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[00:20:59.556 --> 00:21:01.257]  MyPatriotsupply.com.
[00:21:02.097 --> 00:21:08.065]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:21:08.265 --> 00:21:12.450]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:21:12.831 --> 00:21:17.377]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:20.380]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.884]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:21:26.145 --> 00:21:33.011]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:21:33.511 --> 00:21:37.274]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:21:37.655 --> 00:21:42.439]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:43.600]  This is innovating.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:51.147]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:21:51.327 --> 00:21:55.411]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:22:01.477 --> 00:22:01.877]  Question.
[00:22:02.237 --> 00:22:06.478]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:22:07.018 --> 00:22:07.879]  Answer, yes.
[00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:14.060]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Teriganics.

[00:23:01.229 --> 00:23:03.051]  The human body is extraordinary.
[00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:07.356]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.

[00:23:54.755 --> 00:23:59.700]  Call 866-295-5305 or go to HBextract.com.
[00:24:09.889 --> 00:24:16.836]  All this stuff you heard about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of horse dung.
[00:24:18.271 --> 00:24:21.873]  Americans traditionally love to fight.
[00:24:22.734 --> 00:24:27.016]  All real Americans love the sting of battle.
[00:24:29.538 --> 00:24:39.644]  When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, big league ball players, the toughest boxers.
[00:24:41.525 --> 00:24:46.148]  Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser.
[00:24:47.489 --> 00:24:49.770]  Americans play to win all the time.
[00:24:49.991 --> 00:24:53.733]  I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed.
[00:24:55.734 --> 00:24:59.996]  That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war.
[00:25:01.778 --> 00:25:06.941]  Because the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans.
[00:25:09.542 --> 00:25:14.105]  Now, an army is a team.
[00:25:15.925 --> 00:25:18.186]  It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team.
[00:25:18.707 --> 00:25:20.708]  This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap.
[00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:31.874]  The villainous bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality for the Saturday Evening Post don't know anything more about real battle than they do about fornicating.
[00:25:35.196 --> 00:25:38.178]  Now we have the finest food and equipment.
[00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:39.279]  Alright.
[00:25:40.636 --> 00:25:51.162]  That's George C. Scott in the movie Patton actually word-for-word reenacting a speech that Patton gave and he was talking about individuality in the military and saying America never lost a fight.
[00:25:51.543 --> 00:26:06.972]  That was up until we went under UN control for Korea and then Vietnam and it was designed to create a counterculture movement that could pose as heroes and to get the well-meaning young people to become the new socialist elite and bring in their new tyranny.
[00:26:08.635 --> 00:26:11.678]  Rand Corporation, you name it, it's all been declassified.
[00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:12.980]  And now we're under it.
[00:26:14.361 --> 00:26:20.307]  And they want to break this country once and for all, break our national sovereignty, and teach us how to be losers.
[00:26:21.188 --> 00:26:29.958]  And now America, with the most winning record in science, patents, trailblazing, war fighting, literature, art,
[00:26:30.578 --> 00:26:32.559]  Nobody had anything on America.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:40.345]  That wasn't Americans saying that, that was the French, that was the Japanese, that was the Germans, that was the British, that was the Dutch, that was the Spanish.
[00:26:40.685 --> 00:26:43.607]  Historians marveled at the American spirit.
[00:26:43.947 --> 00:26:45.048]  We were exceptional.
[00:26:45.348 --> 00:26:49.031]  When Vladimir Putin says you're not exceptional, and stop thinking you're exceptional,
[00:26:49.631 --> 00:26:52.672]  He's saying, stop being arrogant like you can just do whatever you want.
[00:26:52.912 --> 00:26:53.792]  You're not exceptional.
[00:26:54.032 --> 00:26:55.532]  I disagree with Vladimir Putin.
[00:26:55.912 --> 00:27:04.694]  America was exceptional in many ways on the eve of July 4th, and I'm going to talk tomorrow in a special taped broadcast, I'm going to do at least for the first hour.
[00:27:04.714 --> 00:27:06.015]  I'm going to tape today.
[00:27:06.315 --> 00:27:08.195]  We'll be here with an original show tomorrow, but I'm going to tape it.
[00:27:08.575 --> 00:27:15.317]  Then back Sunday live, we're going to be going over some of the reasons America really is exceptional.
[00:27:17.642 --> 00:27:25.691]  But now, it's not that we were exceptional in a lot of good ways, and also exceptional in some bad ways.
[00:27:25.751 --> 00:27:26.793]  Everything's multifaceted.
[00:27:29.477 --> 00:27:45.001]  Now we're exceptionally overweight, exceptionally unhealthy, exceptional diabetes, exceptional cancer, exceptionally low IQs, exceptionally low industrial capacity, exceptionally lazy population on average, and exceptionally pathetic.
[00:27:45.141 --> 00:27:50.522]  No one else puts up with having their genitals groped by the TSA and naked body scanners while the borders are wide open.
[00:27:51.283 --> 00:27:53.566]  No one else puts up with a government that publicly funds Al Qaeda.
[00:27:53.906 --> 00:28:02.015]  No one else puts up with illegal aliens being given free welfare and driver's license, which they're then allowed to vote with in more than six states.
[00:28:02.335 --> 00:28:04.317]  And Colorado is set to be the seventh state.
[00:28:04.798 --> 00:28:05.759]  Game over, folks!
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.821]  Just like they say in the movie Aliens.
[00:28:08.201 --> 00:28:09.323]  Game over, man!
[00:28:09.683 --> 00:28:10.404]  Game over!
[00:28:10.424 --> 00:28:12.146]  What do you mean they cut the power?
[00:28:14.295 --> 00:28:16.116]  I mean, that's basically what this comes down to.
[00:28:16.716 --> 00:28:23.679]  North American Union, like Nancy Pelosi and General Petraeus, both said in the last two weeks, the border's gone.
[00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:28.320]  Mexico just got rid of its southern border and is flooding the U.S.
[00:28:29.301 --> 00:28:34.583]  On record, in the Central American newspapers, it says, you will be arrested if you go into the major cities.
[00:28:34.943 --> 00:28:39.905]  Stay at the train terminals, go in, the federales and army will escort you.
[00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:51.194]  They get on planes, they land at military bases, coordinated, like Biggs Field in El Paso, and Major Fields in San Antonio, and Dallas, and Houston.
[00:28:51.454 --> 00:28:54.556]  I mean, they're landing, calling in the air traffic.
[00:28:54.596 --> 00:29:00.298]  If a citizen flies over in a Cessna, F-16s are launched, you're brought down, you're arrested, charged with a felony, lose your license.
[00:29:01.979 --> 00:29:06.801]  The aircraft are landing at military bases to facilitate this.
[00:29:07.121 --> 00:29:09.282]  Three months ago, the Border Patrol President went public,
[00:29:10.745 --> 00:29:21.411]  To Breitbart, that was interviewed, audio and video, two different interviews, so did the Vice President, and said there is a stand down from San Diego to Brownsville.
[00:29:23.332 --> 00:29:25.693]  And then we went down there with cameras and it's on video.
[00:29:26.593 --> 00:29:27.914]  But it's beyond the stand down.
[00:29:28.534 --> 00:29:32.276]  They are ordered to put them on buses and ship them in, and I know you know that.
[00:29:32.757 --> 00:29:38.580]  But we're just now forcing that national debate, and you notice there's people demonstrating against this?
[00:29:39.571 --> 00:29:41.312]  And they're calling them racist and all this other garbage.
[00:29:41.752 --> 00:29:48.336]  I mean, imagine if you went to Russia or Switzerland or anywhere else and said, I'm showing up here for everything free, they would laugh at you.
[00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:50.318]  We have become a joke.
[00:29:50.978 --> 00:29:52.139]  Need to start admitting that.
[00:29:52.179 --> 00:29:55.801]  What we are is in a major battle.
[00:29:55.821 --> 00:29:56.641]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:56.681 --> 00:29:58.903]  This is all about NAU.
[00:29:59.143 --> 00:29:59.703]  NAU.
[00:29:59.763 --> 00:30:00.724]  I'll break it down straight ahead.
[00:30:02.927 --> 00:30:06.970]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:11.114]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:30:11.374 --> 00:30:14.797]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:30:15.037 --> 00:30:17.920]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:25.406]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:29.287]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:30:29.547 --> 00:30:33.809]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:30:33.969 --> 00:30:39.890]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.712]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:30:43.872 --> 00:30:46.412]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:30:46.613 --> 00:30:47.933]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:30:48.113 --> 00:30:49.353]  It's time to take action.
[00:30:49.473 --> 00:30:51.134]  It's time to filter our water.
[00:30:51.254 --> 00:30:55.417]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:59.019]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:59.099 --> 00:31:02.221]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:31:18.972 --> 00:31:21.574]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:31:21.874 --> 00:31:27.057]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:31:27.338 --> 00:31:34.222]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:31:34.722 --> 00:31:38.485]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:31:38.845 --> 00:31:43.648]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:43.968 --> 00:31:44.829]  This is innovating.
[00:31:45.089 --> 00:31:52.391]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:31:52.571 --> 00:31:56.632]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:56.832 --> 00:32:01.994]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:09.719]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:32:09.819 --> 00:32:11.981]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:32:12.181 --> 00:32:17.265]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:32:17.445 --> 00:32:22.389]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:32:22.609 --> 00:32:25.691]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:32:25.931 --> 00:32:29.793]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:32:30.013 --> 00:32:34.256]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:32:34.336 --> 00:32:44.341]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:48.904]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:32:48.984 --> 00:32:50.725]  The new Infowars Life Lung Cleanser
[00:32:51.146 --> 00:32:51.767]  We're good to go.
[00:33:20.049 --> 00:33:24.891]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:24.931 --> 00:33:26.331]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:27.732]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:28.252 --> 00:33:32.953]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.413 --> 00:33:34.794]  Take me to the center!
[00:33:35.914 --> 00:33:41.456]  Take me through the centuries to supersonic years!
[00:33:51.886 --> 00:33:56.507]  The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes.
[00:33:57.408 --> 00:33:58.148]  Yeah!
[00:33:59.288 --> 00:34:05.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is July 3rd on this Thursday Global Transmission.
[00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.970]  We are LIBE.
[00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.771]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:11.511]  Central Standard Time.
[00:34:11.551 --> 00:34:13.812]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:28.596]  There is no doubt anyone who's ever lived and any experiences knows that dependency breeds sloth, envy, evil, corruption, decadence, unhealthiness, mental illness.
[00:34:29.457 --> 00:34:38.481]  Victor Hugo, one of my favorite people to quote, French statesman and philosopher said that prosperity makes monsters.
[00:34:39.242 --> 00:34:40.402]  Adversity makes men.
[00:34:40.422 --> 00:34:42.524]  I just kind of did it backwards.
[00:34:42.844 --> 00:34:43.704]  Adversity makes men.
[00:34:43.744 --> 00:34:44.805]  Prosperity makes monsters.
[00:34:45.984 --> 00:35:02.448]  He also said no army can stop an idea whose time has come and the globalists think that they're going to use high-tech systems to allow their dehumanization to finally work and at this time tyranny will really succeed.
[00:35:02.928 --> 00:35:06.569]  There's an ancient war by control freaks against independent people.
[00:35:07.169 --> 00:35:10.149]  They don't like men that are better than them independently.
[00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:12.690]  They don't like women that are better than them independently.
[00:35:14.022 --> 00:35:20.586]  They have always sought to create organizations and systems to crush the greater spirits.
[00:35:22.908 --> 00:35:25.089]  And that's what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.351]  They are at war with us.
[00:35:28.472 --> 00:35:38.118]  And you are an independent, strong person who has dignity and who values being a good, honorable person, and they don't like that.
[00:35:39.499 --> 00:35:40.920]  And they're going to come after you.
[00:35:42.554 --> 00:35:43.655]  You don't want power.
[00:35:44.315 --> 00:35:45.656]  You don't want to run things.
[00:35:45.756 --> 00:35:47.277]  You don't want to boss people around.
[00:35:47.297 --> 00:35:49.298]  You don't want to be in control.
[00:35:50.078 --> 00:35:53.060]  You have enough dignity to not want to run other people's lives.
[00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:54.941]  Well, I got news for you.
[00:35:55.882 --> 00:36:01.145]  You're going to have to step up and take control of things or you're going to lose your freedom.
[00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:07.130]  We have now entered the most decadent cycle this world has undoubtedly ever seen.
[00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:16.616]  Every major historian, every major social critic, psychologist, anthropologist, they're all on records from different perspectives.
[00:36:18.417 --> 00:36:21.499]  I don't care if it's George Will or Camille Paglia.
[00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:24.461]  I don't care if it's Dinesh D'Souza or Michael Savage.
[00:36:27.228 --> 00:36:33.670]  I don't care who the researcher is, left, right, center, libertarian, it doesn't matter.
[00:36:34.131 --> 00:36:36.071]  Humanity is entering the great crisis.
[00:36:38.552 --> 00:36:43.534]  And corruption is accelerating and hiding in the complexity.
[00:36:44.434 --> 00:36:54.438]  But if we, the good men and women out there, who aren't perfect but have a heart that loves justice, stop complying with open tyranny, rediscover our human dignity,
[00:36:56.812 --> 00:37:00.653]  Oppression and all of its diseases will vanish like phantoms at dawn.
[00:37:02.454 --> 00:37:04.554]  Like mist at dawn, to quote Thomas Jefferson.
[00:37:05.175 --> 00:37:06.155]  I'm paraphrasing the quote.
[00:37:08.696 --> 00:37:22.260]  But if the people are educated in basic liberty and armed and ready to defend their freedom, tyranny and all of its corruptions will fade like the mist of phantoms at dawn.
[00:37:25.236 --> 00:37:29.699]  That's my own paraphrase of the larger quote that I haven't read in years.
[00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:32.080]  Look up a Thomas Jefferson quote about phantoms at dawn.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.441]  I can give you the actual quote.
[00:37:34.982 --> 00:37:36.003]  That's what's going on here.
[00:37:36.183 --> 00:37:38.844]  Ignoring it doesn't make it go away, it makes it worse.
[00:37:39.064 --> 00:37:54.594]  And we've now reached that breach point that I could intellectually see, but also at my gut level feel the last few years, where wars are starting from Central Europe to Eastern Europe to the Middle East to Africa to Asia, with China threatening to attack
[00:37:55.683 --> 00:37:59.307]  Not just Japan now, but the Philippines.
[00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:02.531]  The Philippines.
[00:38:05.274 --> 00:38:11.362]  Officially, a month ago, said we may just take major islands, like the Japanese did in World War II.
[00:38:11.402 --> 00:38:15.607]  I mean, it's... The headlines are so off the chart.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:29.788]  And then mainstream news is covering the latest kidnapped child with Nancy Grace, and how Alex Jones is deeply racist, and behind the Boston bombings, and how, you know, the alternative media needs to be shut down because it's evil, and how horrible Drudge is.
[00:38:30.688 --> 00:38:32.169]  I mean, it's Twilight Zone, folks.
[00:38:32.749 --> 00:38:38.613]  The White House has media matters every day attacking this operation.
[00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:43.953]  And other pro-liberty operations wanting us shut down.
[00:38:44.393 --> 00:38:49.096]  What does that tell you about the all-powerful Sauron that is supposedly the New World Order?
[00:38:50.997 --> 00:38:51.958]  They're not that powerful.
[00:38:54.359 --> 00:38:58.902]  We could shake them off like fleas if we ever decided to do it.
[00:38:59.522 --> 00:39:00.283]  And they know that.
[00:39:01.937 --> 00:39:08.639]  They found the quote, enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:09.780]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:39:14.642 --> 00:39:17.723]  And there's a longer quote that I conflated with that earlier part, but yeah.
[00:39:18.463 --> 00:39:19.063]  Evil spirits.
[00:39:21.324 --> 00:39:22.084]  Not phantoms.
[00:39:26.466 --> 00:39:26.666]  Yeah.
[00:39:30.828 --> 00:39:31.708]  Were you just on air, CJ?
[00:39:33.469 --> 00:39:38.090]  I'm glad you are, because when you talk to me, that's why you're welcome to pop in anytime you want.
[00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:38.750]  Thanks.
[00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:41.751]  Because it sounds like I'm talking to myself when you talk to me.
[00:39:42.091 --> 00:39:42.912]  I go, yeah, that's right.
[00:39:42.932 --> 00:39:43.672]  It's like talking to a fan.
[00:39:43.692 --> 00:39:45.992]  And my dad's heard it before and go, who are you talking to?
[00:39:46.012 --> 00:39:47.013]  I sound like a crazy person.
[00:39:47.313 --> 00:39:49.053]  I already am, obviously, insane.
[00:39:49.493 --> 00:39:50.294]  So please don't.
[00:39:50.314 --> 00:39:52.594]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex is talking to a real human being.
[00:39:54.195 --> 00:39:54.495]  All right.
[00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:57.991]  I should probably open the phones up.
[00:39:58.051 --> 00:39:59.472]  I mean, there's just so much news here.
[00:39:59.492 --> 00:40:00.752]  A toll-free number to join us.
[00:40:00.792 --> 00:40:04.694]  First-time callers on this Thursday that feels like a Friday.
[00:40:04.714 --> 00:40:05.495]  800-259-9231.
[00:40:05.515 --> 00:40:07.016]  800-259-9231.
[00:40:08.536 --> 00:40:20.883]  In California and other states, people are going out with American flags to their border that's been collapsed, where the Homeland Security black bus is pulling in, now from Mexico.
[00:40:22.022 --> 00:40:23.583]  They're not even dropping them off at the border now.
[00:40:23.603 --> 00:40:33.171]  They're just bringing them in to then be deployed by the tens of thousands every few days as Democratic Party voters as Colorado and other states vote to give them driver's license to vote.
[00:40:34.472 --> 00:40:37.934]  So all of this is going on right now.
[00:40:38.114 --> 00:40:39.896]  All of this is unfolding right now.
[00:40:40.456 --> 00:40:43.739]  I mean, imagine if Mexico was busing U.S.
[00:40:43.759 --> 00:40:49.243]  citizens in by the tens of thousands every few days and giving us welfare and letting us vote.
[00:40:49.523 --> 00:40:51.805]  You would have Mexicans on their border protesting it.
[00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:59.714]  I mean, what are you if you're a citizen and pay taxes?
[00:40:59.914 --> 00:41:07.658]  What is it if you are a citizen and then you pay for everything but get nothing?
[00:41:08.019 --> 00:41:11.821]  The veterans are having their health care cut so they can enroll illegals.
[00:41:11.861 --> 00:41:12.541]  That's in the news.
[00:41:12.801 --> 00:41:19.185]  That's now on Fox News last night on Neil Cavuto with whistleblowers that have told Congress this and nothing's being done.
[00:41:21.099 --> 00:41:28.425]  I mean, it's all a fraud, and then Obama's up there going, you darn anti-immigrant racist, in a speech over the weekend.
[00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:31.267]  Another speech he gave a few days ago, we played clips here.
[00:41:31.888 --> 00:41:34.249]  How dare you not do anything about the border!
[00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:35.731]  That's why this is happening!
[00:41:40.114 --> 00:41:48.941]  And all of this is going on, while every other form of lawlessness you can imagine is unfolding.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:58.948]  And then Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi and Petraeus and all of them are saying in all these big think tank meetings, no, this is about North America.
[00:41:59.548 --> 00:42:00.729]  What comes after America?
[00:42:01.049 --> 00:42:01.790]  North America.
[00:42:03.472 --> 00:42:07.275]  That's why they have US troops at public events patrolling Canada.
[00:42:07.735 --> 00:42:09.297]  I mean, that's in the Toronto Star.
[00:42:09.717 --> 00:42:12.499]  That's in the National Post.
[00:42:14.941 --> 00:42:15.422]  Look it up.
[00:42:16.425 --> 00:42:19.708]  Mexican and Canadian troops are to patrol America.
[00:42:20.348 --> 00:42:21.329]  Canadian and U.S.
[00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:22.670]  troops are to patrol Mexico.
[00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.333]  And vice versa.
[00:42:27.373 --> 00:42:37.721]  And, you know, I've got family in the last year who isn't in Afghanistan or Iraq anymore running helicopter operations and ground operations, you name it.
[00:42:37.841 --> 00:42:39.102]  They're in Mexico.
[00:42:39.863 --> 00:42:41.184]  And I don't just mean northern Mexico.
[00:42:41.244 --> 00:42:42.465]  I mean deep in Mexico.
[00:42:48.146 --> 00:42:49.287]  All State Department run.
[00:42:54.631 --> 00:42:57.893]  And the public doesn't even know this is going on.
[00:42:58.693 --> 00:43:06.759]  We had Celica Steele, former DEA agent, retired Vietnam veteran, been a Border Patrol agent after Vietnam, became a DEA.
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:16.366]  Saying, eight years ago on this show, 2005, as it was eight years ago, nine years ago, the videos are public,
[00:43:17.239 --> 00:43:25.324]  Saying, our government's training Los Zetas as a CIA secret army to destabilize and collapse Mexico into the United States, and they're going to bring in martial law using it.
[00:43:27.866 --> 00:43:31.708]  And then Shelley, they came to Shelley and said, yeah, we heard your interview.
[00:43:31.728 --> 00:43:39.734]  He did another interview with us and they said, in studio, with video, he was in Kevin Booth's documentary that aired on Showtime as well, about it.
[00:43:41.074 --> 00:43:42.916]  And they came to him and they said, you need to shut up.
[00:43:43.456 --> 00:43:44.757]  He's a school teacher in South Texas.
[00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:51.814]  And then because he was in a divorce and stuff, he had to sell his 20 guns to get money.
[00:43:53.135 --> 00:43:54.095]  And he moved into a trailer.
[00:43:55.336 --> 00:43:56.357]  You know how divorces are.
[00:43:57.978 --> 00:43:58.859]  No criminal record.
[00:43:59.059 --> 00:43:59.699]  School teacher.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:01.341]  In McAllen.
[00:44:03.902 --> 00:44:06.865]  And he went to the gun show at three gun shows and sold his guns.
[00:44:07.865 --> 00:44:09.667]  And a buddy kept saying, sell me another shotgun.
[00:44:09.687 --> 00:44:10.247]  Sell me another shotgun.
[00:44:10.267 --> 00:44:11.408]  So he finally sold him a shotgun.
[00:44:11.788 --> 00:44:15.511]  Just like the Green Beret with Ruby Ridge.
[00:44:18.744 --> 00:44:22.485]  And the state police pulled him over the ATF and said, you're going to prison.
[00:44:22.505 --> 00:44:25.226]  And they railroaded him into prison for three years for gun running.
[00:44:25.986 --> 00:44:26.907]  Because he sold his guns.
[00:44:26.927 --> 00:44:27.487]  They set him up.
[00:44:29.287 --> 00:44:31.568]  That's why I've had family even say, hey, I want to buy that gun from you.
[00:44:31.588 --> 00:44:32.829]  No, I'm not even selling it to you.
[00:44:33.569 --> 00:44:39.211]  I mean, it's crazy, ladies and gentlemen, how screwed up this country is.
[00:44:39.251 --> 00:44:41.531]  And of course, everything Sully said came out.
[00:44:41.831 --> 00:44:43.252]  It came out in the El Paso Times.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:58.453]  About three years ago, and it came out in the Chicago Tribune three years ago, and then over the last two years, years after Kurt Nemo reported on it, we reported on it, that Los Zetas is totally CIA run, came out in federal court to knock out the other groups and destabilize Mexico.
[00:44:58.473 --> 00:45:01.876]  So the globalists are collapsing Mexico into 130,000 dead in eight years.
[00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:14.540]  They're overflowing the United States with refugees, who then come into the very arms of the globalists, who then become political voters in a bloc to take down the country.
[00:45:20.205 --> 00:45:21.987]  That's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.132]  That's how the globalists operate.
[00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:35.292]  And that's the country we live in.
[00:45:38.192 --> 00:45:49.215]  You get a divorce, you're a sniper, army veteran, board patrol agent, DEA, now a school teacher, you shell your guns, you go to jail.
[00:45:49.656 --> 00:45:50.656]  Totally legal and lawful.
[00:45:50.916 --> 00:45:54.777]  They've got judges that would put a two-year-old into a gas chamber if they were told to.
[00:45:57.219 --> 00:46:03.664]  You ship tens of thousands of guns into Mexico to destabilize Mexico and blame the Second Amendment, you don't get in trouble.
[00:46:05.346 --> 00:46:11.971]  This is the country we live in where they allow the IRS to do things that are literally 100,000 times what Nixon did.
[00:46:12.792 --> 00:46:17.335]  Nixon had 120-something names in a safe, never used them with their IRS records.
[00:46:18.096 --> 00:46:26.563]  Obama publicly uses the IRS on tens of thousands of people, putting innocent people in jail, persecuting political speech, arresting Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:46:29.793 --> 00:46:30.693]  And doesn't get in trouble.
[00:46:31.074 --> 00:46:41.378]  You see, this is the total lawless evil that they have allowed, and then they've got coyotes publicly shipping people across on jet skis, shooting anybody in the head that gives them a problem.
[00:46:42.119 --> 00:46:46.441]  When you get shot in the head and your husband dies, the media says, oh, you're just being racist and made this up.
[00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:51.123]  Maybe the wife shot the guy in the head, until they get caught shooting more people in the head.
[00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:57.594]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:59.279]  America is gone.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.593]  America is a giant joke to the world because we act like a joke.
[00:47:05.014 --> 00:47:18.119]  You take your shoes off, your belt off, you get yelled at by the TSA, you go through the lines, you get naked body scanned, until you sign up for Trusted Traveler, and waive all your rights into their system, which is the national ID card they planned all along.
[00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:22.881]  And then now, I noticed at the airport, they're phasing it back in to still search you when you do that.
[00:47:23.141 --> 00:47:24.521]  I mean, we know their whole plan.
[00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:28.423]  Even the TSA people that call themselves agents, they don't know what's going on.
[00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:34.273]  And by the way, I saw them putting little kids back in the naked body scanners.
[00:47:34.533 --> 00:47:36.774]  Congress told them, don't do that anymore, we'll defund you.
[00:47:36.975 --> 00:47:38.176]  And they go, okay, we'll stop.
[00:47:38.216 --> 00:47:38.956]  And they didn't stop.
[00:47:39.176 --> 00:47:42.679]  Because it's a military operation against us!
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.962]  Our government funds ISIS.
[00:47:46.022 --> 00:47:47.343]  I have a stack of articles here.
[00:47:47.783 --> 00:47:51.546]  They arrested people in Austin and Houston last month.
[00:47:54.255 --> 00:48:06.949]  In Austin and Houston last month for trying to go join ISIS to fight and now a woman in Colorado has been arrested for trying to give material aid to ISIS which is Al Qaeda.
[00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:12.155]  Now my issue is our government publicly gave them Stinger missiles.
[00:48:17.009 --> 00:48:23.833]  Our government has opened the border up for nationals out of Syria, Iraq, you name it, on record to be pouring across.
[00:48:24.214 --> 00:48:26.155]  China, Pakistan, it's just wide open.
[00:48:26.615 --> 00:48:33.840]  And people from all over the world are landing now in airports in Mexico, it's on the news down there, overflowing to then take flights into the U.S.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.222]  or to take flights up to the border and come right across.
[00:48:37.682 --> 00:48:45.587]  But they'll arrest you, though, if you try to give material support because one hand doesn't know what the other hand's doing, see?
[00:48:47.486 --> 00:48:50.727]  Or it creates headlines, I guess, that scare the public that there's a terror threat.
[00:48:50.767 --> 00:48:51.848]  Of course it's a terror threat.
[00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:54.349]  Our government's illegitimate and is running it.
[00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:58.491]  So, that's just some of the information.
[00:48:59.991 --> 00:49:02.972]  Smugglers threaten landowners in Cameron County, Texas.
[00:49:03.653 --> 00:49:06.014]  CDC ignores diseases, illegals, crisis.
[00:49:06.314 --> 00:49:07.574]  We reported on that yesterday.
[00:49:08.095 --> 00:49:11.116]  Today, HHS reports that
[00:49:13.274 --> 00:49:16.396]  That indeed is going on, and that they are, quote, responding to it.
[00:49:16.416 --> 00:49:16.856]  No, they're not.
[00:49:17.156 --> 00:49:19.278]  They're busting them in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:19.558 --> 00:49:20.619]  They're just releasing them.
[00:49:20.979 --> 00:49:21.619]  It's incredible.
[00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:27.023]  I'm going to go on a break, come back and talk to Daniel, David, Shane, Derek, and Seth in the next segment, the one after that.
[00:49:27.043 --> 00:49:33.707]  Then Lord Monkton is joining us with breaking news, and then the professor, Amamoto, will be joining us.
[00:49:35.475 --> 00:49:41.500]  He is from UC Davis, a mainline, you know, established professor, saying this is part of a takeover plan, basically.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.502]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:49:44.022 --> 00:49:49.667]  Warren's amnesty will lead to creation of subservient, underclass, literally slaves of the government.
[00:49:50.227 --> 00:49:53.350]  And he's not saying that because he dislikes the mainly Hispanic immigrants.
[00:49:53.830 --> 00:50:01.877]  It's that it's being done on purpose to create a new permanent Hispanic slave class that loves their slavery under racial identity.
[00:50:02.297 --> 00:50:03.538]  This is how you make slaves.
[00:50:03.698 --> 00:50:04.319]  You make them love it.
[00:50:05.541 --> 00:50:07.903]  So, that's coming up, and he's an expert on that.
[00:50:08.043 --> 00:50:12.386]  So, briefly, we will sell out of these very, very quickly.
[00:50:13.407 --> 00:50:19.371]  We have the new belt buckles in, the new Molon Labe belt buckles, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:23.694]  RM, we've already sold half of them after they've been in for a week and a half.
[00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:28.497]  And we have just a few of the George Washington belt buckles that were not as popular, still popular, almost sold out.
[00:50:29.018 --> 00:50:34.682]  But we have, ladies and gentlemen, the Molon Labe brass and the nickel silver plated.
[00:50:35.683 --> 00:50:37.244]  Made in America for $44.95.
[00:50:38.566 --> 00:50:40.527]  Belt buckles like this anywhere else would be $100.
[00:50:40.888 --> 00:50:42.249]  They cost us $20-something to make.
[00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:43.870]  Help support the InfoWar.

[00:52:40.725 --> 00:52:41.465]  This capitalism?
[00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:47.648]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[00:54:59.247 --> 00:55:05.869]  Weldon was showing it to me, saying it had gone up, but I don't see it at madeits1776.com.
[00:55:05.909 --> 00:55:08.570]  But there is a new Molon Labe shirt.

[00:55:44.980 --> 00:56:00.213]  So again, that's MadeIn1776.com takes you right to the Made in America area of the site, or the master site, MadeIn1776.com is a subsection of InfowarsStore.com.
[00:56:00.873 --> 00:56:02.795]  Okay, let's go to Daniel in New York.
[00:56:03.115 --> 00:56:06.798]  Thanks for calling in as the country is publicly collapsed.
[00:56:06.958 --> 00:56:12.183]  Obama and the New World Order's little birthday present to the former republic.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.481]  Hey Alex, thank you for having me.
[00:56:15.521 --> 00:56:17.843]  I'm a really big fan and I really appreciate all you do.
[00:56:17.863 --> 00:56:21.326]  Well thank you, my friend.
[00:56:21.666 --> 00:56:28.331]  You are reporting on your website right now an impeachable bomber protestor charged with flying InfoWars and Gadsden flags.
[00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:35.557]  Well that's me, who was arrested, and I want to address you and your listeners about how my rights were being violated in New York State.
[00:56:35.937 --> 00:56:43.063]  They are charging me for criminal nuisance and disorderly conduct for holding a peaceful impeachable bomber protest, which no one was harmed or injured over the expressway, and I'm
[00:56:43.783 --> 00:56:49.349]  I had a press conference on Tuesday where my lawyers were putting a lot of pressure on Nassau County.
[00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:51.171]  You know, it's funny that you called in.
[00:56:51.211 --> 00:56:54.235]  We have a story about you at InfoWars.com today, Daniel.
[00:56:55.136 --> 00:56:58.159]  And this is in New York where they said, if you're pro-gun or pro-life, get out.
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.442]  And then Cuomo said, I'm serious, get out.
[00:57:02.446 --> 00:57:06.968]  He almost said we'll break your legs, like right out of, you know, The Godfather or something.
[00:57:07.748 --> 00:57:19.173]  And I want to get you on as a guest, maybe on the nightly news tonight, or maybe on the Sunday show, to properly talk about what happened to you, where the cop says you're endangering the public by your free speech.
[00:57:19.873 --> 00:57:23.175]  Monsanto will tell reporters they can't be on public sidewalks.
[00:57:24.305 --> 00:57:28.269]  I just saw a video of Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton doing that in America.
[00:57:28.289 --> 00:57:30.151]  They go, yeah, it's a public sidewalk, but you can't be here.
[00:57:30.752 --> 00:57:31.853]  This is what they do.
[00:57:32.253 --> 00:57:33.274]  This is the new attitude.
[00:57:33.334 --> 00:57:40.261]  I have videos out today where police beat up video people and then charge you with attempted murder when they beat you.
[00:57:41.002 --> 00:57:55.361]  If you put your hand up as they billy club you, but the borders are wide open, yeah, you need to win this in court, and then you need to go after the so-called immunity of the police officer, because they don't have immunity when they're not executing the law, when they're frustrating the law.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.843]  You know, like cops trying to block black people from voting in the South in the fifties.
[00:58:01.264 --> 00:58:02.525]  They then have no immunity.
[00:58:02.905 --> 00:58:04.826]  And this fake immunity must be broken.
[00:58:05.147 --> 00:58:07.108]  And the grand juries and the juries must break it!
[00:58:07.869 --> 00:58:08.429]  Anything else?
[00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:10.891]  You want us to get your number and get you on the show?
[00:58:11.949 --> 00:58:13.269]  Yes, I would love that.
[00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:14.149]  I really appreciate it.
[00:58:14.189 --> 00:58:15.570]  I would love to tell my story.
[00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:17.230]  I'm wrongfully accused.
[00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:18.230]  I was low on my rights.
[00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:19.651]  And I'm going to fight this.
[00:58:19.671 --> 00:58:20.511]  I'm going to fight this to the very end.
[00:58:20.571 --> 00:58:21.151]  You know, I'll tell you what.
[00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:22.231]  We're going to put you on hold.
[00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:24.532]  And then, do you have video Skype?
[00:58:24.552 --> 00:58:26.792]  Because I'll do an interview with you after the show for the Nightly News tonight.
[00:58:28.032 --> 00:58:28.693]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:28.813 --> 00:58:29.573]  I can download Skype.
[00:58:29.593 --> 00:58:30.393]  I have no problem with that.
[00:58:31.053 --> 00:58:32.673]  Alright, well listen.
[00:58:32.773 --> 00:58:37.874]  Let's tape you for the Nightly News at about 3.15 Central today.
[00:58:37.894 --> 00:58:39.695]  I'm going to get your info right now.
[00:58:39.755 --> 00:58:40.215]  Don't hang up.
[00:58:42.932 --> 00:58:44.716]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.199 --> 00:58:48.363]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.327 --> 00:58:54.228]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:58:54.568 --> 00:59:02.491]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:09.674]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:59:10.154 --> 00:59:14.436]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:59:14.736 --> 00:59:24.919]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:59:25.379 --> 00:59:31.541]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:57.331]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.751 --> 01:00:00.552]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:08.345 --> 01:00:12.508]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:13.188 --> 01:00:13.989]  You want answers?
[01:00:14.769 --> 01:00:15.670]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:19.952]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.513 --> 01:00:24.615]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:30.239]  We're taking your phone calls, and Lord Monckton's on with us for about 40 minutes, and I'll go right back to your calls.
[01:00:31.059 --> 01:00:33.981]  And we have the professor joining us, who's gone public.
[01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:57.841]  Pointing out the fact this is part of a takeover plan by Obama with the open borders and getting into a sociology perspective that I concur with but from an expert position of how it's to create a permanent slave class, a political voting bloc the Democrats tried to forge the black community into but that's not a big enough group for them to fully dominate election cycles so they're trying to use racial control
[01:00:58.641 --> 01:01:11.293]  And primitive programming, which is very effective on humans, period, on Hispanics to forge them into a race-based cult that has gun control, open borders, the end of the family as its sacraments.
[01:01:12.054 --> 01:01:14.096]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[01:01:14.356 --> 01:01:15.638]  Thanks for calling, you're on the air.
[01:01:17.262 --> 01:01:18.743]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking the call.
[01:01:18.803 --> 01:01:21.405]  Long time listener and Prison Planet subscriber.
[01:01:21.486 --> 01:01:23.387]  Wanted to welcome you back from vacation.
[01:01:23.407 --> 01:01:24.908]  Thank you.
[01:01:25.128 --> 01:01:27.711]  A shout out to the prior caller for standing up for our rights.
[01:01:28.871 --> 01:01:30.813]  That's a bold thing he's doing.
[01:01:31.193 --> 01:01:39.360]  But the reason I called you today is I wanted to talk to you about that interview that Karen Hughes of the IMF just did that was posted on the website a couple of days ago.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:44.464]  It was actually put out by SGT Reports that you guys had relinked it.
[01:01:44.884 --> 01:01:52.709]  Have you had a chance to listen to that interview yet and get a read on what she's saying about the Federal Reserve getting ready to collapse?
[01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.211]  Haven't we had her on before?
[01:01:55.231 --> 01:01:57.192]  Yeah, we've had her on.
[01:01:57.612 --> 01:01:58.653]  Let's get her on next week.
[01:02:00.474 --> 01:02:01.795]  In fact, I've been meaning to get her on.
[01:02:01.815 --> 01:02:05.497]  I actually watched some of that interview, listened to some of that interview.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:18.630]  That SGT folks do a great job, and I do want to get her on to talk about that, but that's what a bunch of billionaires are saying right now, and economists, so it's very frightening.
[01:02:20.351 --> 01:02:26.998]  Oh absolutely, but she actually stated in that interview that the dollar is going to be replaced by a gold standard currency.
[01:02:28.513 --> 01:02:35.595]  Well, you know, she was mid-level, and I think she's an eloquent person who has a lot of courage, so I think she's a very credible, nice person.
[01:02:36.135 --> 01:02:43.016]  But I've interviewed her before, and I just don't think that everything she says is exactly the way it is.
[01:02:45.037 --> 01:02:49.458]  The IMF and World Bank have discussed a global 10% backed
[01:02:52.054 --> 01:02:59.996]  SDR, 10% back with gold, so they could then manipulate gold at the same time, but still have fractional reserve banking.
[01:03:00.997 --> 01:03:04.077]  But then, a lot of the Davos and Bilderberg people don't even want that.
[01:03:04.097 --> 01:03:20.042]  They want it pegged to digital transfers, any type of online banking, any type of purchases in a cashless society with a global Tobin, overlaid with a global Carbon, which is basically an omnibus VAT.
[01:03:21.357 --> 01:03:22.838]  And I think that's the way it's going.
[01:03:24.339 --> 01:03:25.920]  But I look forward to having her on.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.620]  What do you think about it?
[01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:35.426]  Well, I had some problems trying to understand the credibility piece because it doesn't align with scripture, as you know, number one.
[01:03:35.466 --> 01:03:40.429]  And number two, the fact that she's been reinstated to the IMF was a little bit suspect to be a senior counsel.
[01:03:40.469 --> 01:03:43.731]  I mean, she was being chased by the Injustice Department of the U.S.
[01:03:44.331 --> 01:03:45.572]  the last time you interviewed her.
[01:03:45.612 --> 01:03:48.634]  And all of a sudden, she's back in the position she held previously.
[01:03:49.778 --> 01:03:54.540]  Well, I mean, I think she's, my gut is she's a real lady and not a bad person.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:04:00.101]  A lot of times, if you make enough noise and you don't shut up from the intimidation, they try to buy you off.
[01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:13.846]  I mean, I've literally, no exaggeration, at least six, seven times been offered huge contracts, way more money than I even make now to join the establishment.
[01:04:13.926 --> 01:04:16.327]  So that's actually what they do, in my experience.
[01:04:17.392 --> 01:04:23.719]  Is they either kill you, put you in prison, but if you're too, too obnoxious and they don't want to make a big deal out of it, they try to buy you off.
[01:04:23.899 --> 01:04:26.021]  And I'm not saying that's what's happened because I haven't been following it.
[01:04:26.482 --> 01:04:30.366]  It's just that they will try to get you back into the fold to try to get some control over you.
[01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:36.935]  Well, I don't want me to dominate so much of your time, but before I let you go, I just want to let you know I'm holding you and the whole staff up in prayer daily.
[01:04:36.955 --> 01:04:41.176]  I know the Father's got his hands on your organization, and we appreciate what you're doing out here.
[01:04:41.196 --> 01:04:41.856]  God bless you, brother.
[01:04:42.376 --> 01:04:42.997]  God bless you.
[01:04:43.017 --> 01:04:48.798]  Yeah, our best works are dirty rags, but I can feel the presence of God with me every day, and I can feel your prayers.
[01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:50.699]  It's an amazing experience.
[01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:58.141]  Please continue the prayers, and ask that God strengthen me to not be a worldly person, and that I be strong.
[01:04:58.662 --> 01:04:59.382]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.442 --> 01:04:59.882]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.421 --> 01:05:06.444]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:05:06.484 --> 01:05:10.608]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:05:10.848 --> 01:05:14.251]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:17.394]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:05:17.534 --> 01:05:24.860]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.781]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:05:29.021 --> 01:05:33.262]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:05:33.442 --> 01:05:39.363]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:05:39.403 --> 01:05:43.204]  Fluoride, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:05:43.344 --> 01:05:45.884]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:05:46.084 --> 01:05:47.424]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:05:47.584 --> 01:05:48.805]  It's time to take action.
[01:05:48.965 --> 01:05:50.605]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.001]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:06:05.502 --> 01:06:12.486]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:06:12.946 --> 01:06:23.333]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the Earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:06:23.774 --> 01:06:33.020]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the Earth.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.162]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:06:37.802 --> 01:06:41.223]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:06:41.543 --> 01:06:43.144]  Experience the new formula.
[01:06:43.604 --> 01:06:45.605]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:06:46.185 --> 01:06:47.206]  Shield your family.
[01:06:47.526 --> 01:06:48.946]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:07:01.696 --> 01:07:07.760]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.142]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:07:11.242 --> 01:07:12.823]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:19.146]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:07:19.246 --> 01:07:25.150]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:29.053]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:32.156]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:07:32.316 --> 01:07:40.342]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:42.644]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:07:42.704 --> 01:07:43.745]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:07:44.105 --> 01:07:52.855]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:08:05.146 --> 01:08:11.180]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:11.782 --> 01:08:14.769]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.924 --> 01:08:22.546]  I have been syndicated for almost 18 years.
[01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:24.627]  I've been on air 19 and a half years.
[01:08:25.788 --> 01:08:39.158]  And since I've been syndicated back in 1997, late 1997, we have had the line broadcasting from deep behind enemy lines in occupied former United States.
[01:08:39.958 --> 01:08:52.505]  And the reason I've always put that out is because under the North American Union, under globalization, the EU model was the model for Asia and then the Americas, and then the Caribbean, and then Africa.
[01:08:53.105 --> 01:08:57.007]  Under that undemocratic, unelected model, you are literally occupied.
[01:08:59.823 --> 01:09:27.225]  And in 2007, Judicial Watch sued and got the absolute Rosetta Stone of this, thousands of pages that I spent weeks at night, when my small children were growing up, literally reading it, so that I would understand much of the full plan, from the Banff Canada three-day meeting, where you had select inside crony capitalists there, commanding the ministers of the governments,
[01:09:28.914 --> 01:09:33.517]  From Secretary of State on down on what was being set up.
[01:09:33.557 --> 01:09:41.183]  They were actually having parliamentary votes under the secret agreement signed by Bush and Vicente Fox at Baylor University in 2005.
[01:09:43.104 --> 01:09:46.587]  And so you have to be honest that we are literally in an occupied territory.
[01:09:46.627 --> 01:09:50.790]  Just as Lord Monckton who helped found UKIP a few decades ago with Nigel Farage.
[01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:53.772]  Now the fastest growing party not just in the UK but in Europe.
[01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:55.713]  They are the Tea Party in Europe.
[01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:56.894]  Trailblazing.
[01:09:57.435 --> 01:09:58.777]  Not copying our Tea Party.
[01:09:59.137 --> 01:10:00.499]  Our Tea Party came out of England.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.567]  Parliament first voted to not have war with George Washington until King George went down and said, you've got to have a war.
[01:10:07.448 --> 01:10:11.313]  So the fight that we have in America for freedom started with Magna Carta in England.
[01:10:12.599 --> 01:10:12.979]  In 1215.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.021]  And then what came out of that, the Renaissance and everything else that followed.
[01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:19.442]  We now are continuing that same fight.
[01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:21.903]  Globally, we're all in this together.
[01:10:22.503 --> 01:10:31.186]  What started in England and spread all over the world continues on the true spirit of 1776 against tyrants everywhere.
[01:10:31.386 --> 01:10:36.228]  Whether they be big corporations, governments, mentally ill kings, it doesn't matter.
[01:10:36.808 --> 01:10:38.729]  We have a right to self-determine and be free.
[01:10:40.689 --> 01:10:47.459]  And if you look at how they're usurping our freedom, it is the same old story being replayed.
[01:10:47.559 --> 01:10:49.242]  And so we know how to beat this.
[01:10:49.923 --> 01:10:51.285]  We know how to stand against it.
[01:10:51.545 --> 01:10:55.591]  So when I say broadcasting from deep behind enemy lines, that's not
[01:10:56.658 --> 01:10:58.880]  Fiction, that's not hyperbole, that's not hype.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.221]  I'm in FEMA Region 6.
[01:11:01.141 --> 01:11:09.168]  Obama has opened the border, hundreds of thousands of illegals are pouring across, which will detonate the new flood that will be millions, which will be the crisis.
[01:11:09.648 --> 01:11:16.914]  And then I remembered, Tony Blair in 97, 98, 99, I would watch ITN and other channels online,
[01:11:17.554 --> 01:11:38.758]  And when I traveled to England, I would watch him as well, and Paul Watson, reporting from the UK, would write on it, how he got caught telling the border patrol in France, working in a secret deal with France, to ship in hundreds of thousands of illegals, to be put directly on labor dole, to then become the social workers and the new political dominating attack dogs.
[01:11:39.574 --> 01:11:42.276]  I've had even liberal members of parliament on admitting this from England.
[01:11:42.536 --> 01:11:43.317]  This is now well known.
[01:11:43.337 --> 01:11:49.162]  You can type in Tony Blair secret immigration deal, you'll get stories with France, Romania, you name it.
[01:11:50.423 --> 01:12:02.633]  Obama has done this with Mexico to open their southern border to flood us with Central and South American dregs, criminals, unemployed women with children, and there's stacks of news.
[01:12:02.773 --> 01:12:07.737]  So to understand the EU and how 80 plus percent of the laws in England
[01:12:08.786 --> 01:12:14.871]  Are shunned by the EU bureaucracy, not even the EU Parliament, and people in the UK can't even vote.
[01:12:17.273 --> 01:12:31.479]  I wanted to bring this up before we get into his new challenge and new breaking news on the climate change fraud and just some amazing information, but I wanted to bring this up with Lord Monckton first because he pioneered with Nigel Farage the game plan that's beginning to take Europe back.
[01:12:31.999 --> 01:12:33.319]  And this political class is panicking.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:39.142]  I cannot build up this man enough, ladies and gentlemen, or Nigel Farage, who is just a rock star.
[01:12:40.042 --> 01:12:43.984]  I mean, he's like Ron Paul, but also has that super appeal
[01:12:45.424 --> 01:12:48.126]  Of not just a medical doctor, but of more of a super leader.
[01:12:49.247 --> 01:12:52.569]  But he's also a blue-collar working guy, so he just has it all.
[01:12:52.989 --> 01:13:04.756]  These are the leading lights that could literally turn the whole world around, and we have to recognize that so many people got introduced to Lord Monckton, Nigel Farage, who's been coming on for ten years, on this radio show.
[01:13:05.216 --> 01:13:11.040]  Again, to show the power of the people and the fact that our movement for global liberty has only just begun.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.061]  Now, I'm ranting here, but the point is,
[01:13:14.249 --> 01:13:18.892]  They point out, most of our laws are made by the EU, we have no right, it's a dictatorship.
[01:13:20.132 --> 01:13:26.796]  By upping the rhetoric to the level of reality, I mean, when you're under tyranny, you call it what it is, you're not polite about it.
[01:13:27.594 --> 01:13:28.654]  We're doing the same here.
[01:13:28.814 --> 01:13:33.075]  We are in an occupied, illegitimate, globalist, EU system now.
[01:13:33.415 --> 01:13:38.516]  Obama's about to sign this new Pacific trade deal that takes over internet freedom, you name it.
[01:13:39.016 --> 01:13:40.157]  Gun control, you name it.
[01:13:40.197 --> 01:13:41.037]  It's all happening.
[01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:49.939]  Global governance is here, and recognizing it, and the fact that it's undemocratic, it's unelected, it's authoritarian, it's crony, we'll end it.
[01:13:50.999 --> 01:13:55.840]  So I want to first spin this segment on that subject, and then get into an outrageous
[01:13:58.012 --> 01:14:08.540]  A challenge by a professor claiming that, you know, prove climate change isn't real, I'll give you $30,000, but then admitting it's not really a real challenge.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:16.367]  Like the professor here in Austin that said he'd live in a trash bin for a year to prove we can all live with less, and then it turned out he didn't really stay there.
[01:14:17.711 --> 01:14:18.691]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:14:18.711 --> 01:14:23.173]  We're going to talk to him about that, and so much more about the stunts they pull, and the latest.
[01:14:23.193 --> 01:14:33.218]  But Lord Christopher Monckton, a top journalist, former top advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and so much more, and the leading scientist exposing the fraud.
[01:14:33.378 --> 01:14:40.701]  Everything he's written about on his site in the last decade has all been proven absolutely accurate, and so now they're calling for his arrest.
[01:14:41.321 --> 01:14:46.985]  And execution in major publications, because they're such liberals, is Lord Christopher Monckton.
[01:14:47.025 --> 01:14:49.407]  But what about the fact that our border's wide open?
[01:14:49.627 --> 01:14:50.628]  I mean, this is epic.
[01:14:51.148 --> 01:14:54.310]  This is totally epic, and the same thing's been done to the UK.
[01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:55.631]  What are we facing?
[01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:56.472]  How do we stop it?
[01:14:57.130 --> 01:15:02.434]  Well, it's very difficult to stop it when you elect a left-wing government.
[01:15:02.914 --> 01:15:07.438]  Because once they take office, Alex, they then want to hold on to office.
[01:15:07.918 --> 01:15:11.961]  And eventually they become unpopular because high taxes and low government performance.
[01:15:12.021 --> 01:15:13.543]  Eventually people get bored of that.
[01:15:14.263 --> 01:15:17.686]  But the way they can turn the terms of political trade in their favour
[01:15:18.593 --> 01:15:28.899]  Is to say, right, we'll let in left-wing immigrants, poor immigrants from wherever we can get them, because the first generation of those immigrants will always vote left.
[01:15:29.319 --> 01:15:31.421]  And this has been increasingly the pattern now.
[01:15:31.481 --> 01:15:34.142]  You see it with Tony Blair, you see it certainly with Obama.
[01:15:34.743 --> 01:15:42.227]  In order to get Obama elected, he was elected by people who largely didn't originally come from the United States.
[01:15:42.267 --> 01:15:43.288]  They came from somewhere else.
[01:15:44.432 --> 01:15:52.758]  And those are the ones that will vote left because the left will promise them handouts which they say they will take from the rich to give to the poor.
[01:15:53.419 --> 01:16:00.705]  And so the left can live off this and gain themselves office for longer and longer periods as a result of it.
[01:16:01.405 --> 01:16:14.970]  And of course, in the end, what will defeat them is that however hard they try to trash the economy with climate change measures, around the world everybody is paying no attention and most countries are getting rapidly a great deal richer.
[01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:29.576]  As prosperity increases so that it eventually will even reach places like Mexico, which are largely very poor at the moment, but they will become more wealthy, the pressure for immigration to still wealthier countries will diminish.
[01:16:30.316 --> 01:16:32.837]  And when that happens, the left will be extinguished.
[01:16:33.217 --> 01:16:48.404]  So I think we're going through a temporary difficulty where the left will bend the electoral rules by letting people in and then giving them the vote, as Tony Blair did in Britain, and as Obama is doing on a very large scale in the United States.
[01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.245]  Obama is the most nakedly
[01:16:50.785 --> 01:16:54.047]  Partisan political president you've ever had.
[01:16:54.367 --> 01:16:57.329]  He doesn't see himself as President of the United States.
[01:16:57.609 --> 01:17:00.450]  He sees himself as the Chief Rights Commissar.
[01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:03.572]  He sees himself as the effector, the king.
[01:17:03.872 --> 01:17:09.656]  And he does undoubtedly have a deep... I mean, I didn't believe this is two years ago when he put out America.
[01:17:10.636 --> 01:17:21.779]  2016 and it really was the fact that Obama truly hated free market and wealth and success because you tend to think once you're the president and once people are in power they understand that wealth and prosperity is a good thing.
[01:17:21.999 --> 01:17:32.581]  I mean that's an instinct for normal well-adjusted people but then you realize no they really want to shut off our power plants, open our borders, wreck the whole culture, attack the family.
[01:17:32.921 --> 01:17:35.462]  I mean these people are mentally ill degenerates.
[01:17:36.135 --> 01:17:40.139]  Never underestimate the extent to which the left hate the West.
[01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:42.682]  They hate the countries that bring them up.
[01:17:43.002 --> 01:17:44.284]  They hate the prosperity.
[01:17:44.564 --> 01:17:45.845]  They hate the success.
[01:17:46.226 --> 01:17:47.507]  They hate the democracy.
[01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:48.848]  They hate the liberty.
[01:17:48.908 --> 01:17:50.050]  They hate the freedom.
[01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:51.491]  They do not want it.
[01:17:51.551 --> 01:17:52.072]  They want...
[01:17:52.492 --> 01:17:53.393]  Absolute control.
[01:17:53.413 --> 01:17:56.778]  That's why the word totalitarian is so important.
[01:17:56.818 --> 01:18:04.568]  It means somebody who wants to control every little aspect of your life down to the last flickering, poisonous, mercury-filled lightbulb.
[01:18:04.588 --> 01:18:06.250]  And of course... That's the word for them!
[01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:07.632]  They are totalitarians!
[01:18:07.972 --> 01:18:13.157]  That's the thing, and this is a very ancient divide in politics, which you and I have talked of before, Alex.
[01:18:13.217 --> 01:18:24.287]  It goes right back to early imperial China, where the totalitarians were known as legalists, and the more enlightened libertarians, the likes of you and me, Alex, we were called the Confucians.
[01:18:24.907 --> 01:18:41.394]  And this divide between legalism and Confucianism, between totalitarianism and libertarianism, between those who would control us, and we who would be free, and we who would allow others to be free, that divide is the fundamental divide in politics, and always has been, and probably always will be.
[01:18:41.995 --> 01:18:45.036]  Because it's the control freaks that like to go into government.
[01:18:45.703 --> 01:18:47.744]  And a control freak, of course, is a totalitarian.
[01:18:47.784 --> 01:18:52.107]  He wants to control everything, the totality of what is within his reach.
[01:18:52.468 --> 01:18:54.829]  And this is what Obama is all about.
[01:18:54.849 --> 01:18:58.672]  And what is interesting about it is a growing sense that...
[01:18:59.739 --> 01:19:02.882]  Of quasi-moral superiority that they have.
[01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:13.610]  They like to say, we have to save the planet from itself because only we understand the need to save the planet from global warming, for instance.
[01:19:13.890 --> 01:19:20.315]  Now this is basically a device to try to cover up that what they're really doing is nakedly partisan.
[01:19:20.835 --> 01:19:29.000]  Obama doesn't like the coal industry because the coal industry are and have long been the biggest donors to the Republican Party who are his opponents.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.621]  It is as simple as that.
[01:19:30.941 --> 01:19:33.523]  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the climate.
[01:19:33.843 --> 01:19:37.906]  That's why he makes such idiotic statements about it every time he speaks about it.
[01:19:38.526 --> 01:19:42.409]  For instance, there was a wonderful moment, I think about ten days ago, in the Senate.
[01:19:43.269 --> 01:19:52.094]  Well, I think it was Senator Graham who was cross-examining five former heads of the Environmental Destruction Agency, and there they all were.
[01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:55.657]  Hold on, I want to hear that story straight ahead with Lord Christopher Monton.
[01:19:55.677 --> 01:19:57.458]  We'll give you his website on the other side.
[01:19:57.958 --> 01:20:00.500]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:20:02.543 --> 01:20:04.084]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[01:20:04.244 --> 01:20:09.005]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[01:20:09.426 --> 01:20:16.188]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[01:20:16.468 --> 01:20:20.570]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:23.471]  But a friend and patriot has discovered a loophole.
[01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:28.993]  Find out about the NSA loophole before they shut it down at privacylockdown.com.
[01:20:29.213 --> 01:20:30.714]  That's privacylockdown.com.
[01:20:32.034 --> 01:20:33.054]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:33.134 --> 01:20:37.476]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:37.656 --> 01:20:43.258]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:20:43.358 --> 01:20:46.700]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.501]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:21:52.019 --> 01:21:54.440]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[01:22:01.013 --> 01:22:03.594]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:03.835 --> 01:22:08.697]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:16.841]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:17.082 --> 01:22:21.384]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:25.426]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:31.290]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.

[01:24:09.781 --> 01:24:10.821]  Loaded up and truckin'.
[01:24:14.523 --> 01:24:17.864]  Got a long way to go.
[01:24:17.884 --> 01:24:21.586]  And a short time to get there.
[01:24:23.867 --> 01:24:27.628]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org is his website.
[01:24:27.648 --> 01:24:29.449]  We'll put that up on screen for TV viewers.
[01:24:31.363 --> 01:24:32.685]  Lord Christopher Monckton is our guest.
[01:24:32.705 --> 01:24:34.447]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:24:34.467 --> 01:24:42.856]  Then we're going to your phone calls and then on to a professor out in California who is working in the globalist-controlled UC Davis.
[01:24:43.697 --> 01:24:48.222]  We're going to have Professor Hamamoto on who's saying this border being open is exactly what
[01:24:49.281 --> 01:24:55.505]  Lord Monckton just said, total social engineering with a permanent political underclass of the system.
[01:24:55.645 --> 01:24:57.907]  And we need gridlock in government.
[01:24:57.987 --> 01:24:59.648]  It's designed to have separation of powers.
[01:25:00.168 --> 01:25:06.012]  If the Republican Party was trying to extinct the Democratic Party, I want a third, a fourth, a fifth party.
[01:25:06.372 --> 01:25:07.753]  I would be defending the Democratic Party.
[01:25:08.033 --> 01:25:11.676]  I've never thrown my weight behind the Republicans, until now.
[01:25:12.196 --> 01:25:13.897]  That is the Republican Tea Party movement.
[01:25:14.638 --> 01:25:17.920]  Because the Republican leadership, along with the Democrats, is trying to extinct it right now.
[01:25:19.008 --> 01:25:19.869]  This is a big deal.
[01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:29.718]  The Democrats, is what Lord Monson just started getting at, are in a political takeover mode for a political oligarchy to carry out a totalitarian system.
[01:25:30.238 --> 01:25:32.961]  And they're not making any bones about it.
[01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:34.782]  They say, we have the moral authority.
[01:25:35.383 --> 01:25:37.745]  We're going to arrest people that disagree with climate change.
[01:25:38.345 --> 01:25:41.688]  You don't have a right to promote pro-gun stuff and terrorize people, Hillary said.
[01:25:42.029 --> 01:25:43.070]  We want to arrest you.
[01:25:44.273 --> 01:25:46.255]  The enemy isn't Al Qaeda, it's the Tea Party.
[01:25:46.555 --> 01:25:48.536]  I mean, this is outrageous stuff going on.
[01:25:49.217 --> 01:25:56.502]  It's for real, and Lord Monckton was speaking to that, and then he also started getting into the climate fraudsters being questioned in Congress.
[01:25:56.522 --> 01:25:57.343]  Go ahead, Lord Monckton.
[01:25:57.728 --> 01:26:16.218]  Yeah, just to tell you the story about these four or five ex-administrators of the Environmental Destruction Agency, and Senator Graham was questioning them and he said, hands up, any of you who think that Mr. Obama was right when he said that temperatures are rising faster than ever before?
[01:26:16.478 --> 01:26:17.839]  He said it twice recently.
[01:26:18.799 --> 01:26:21.141]  And not a single hand went up.
[01:26:21.181 --> 01:26:28.665]  You see this row of dummies sitting there looking uncomfortable as they had to admit by their not raising their hands that Obama had got it wrong.
[01:26:28.685 --> 01:26:32.467]  In fact, just in, I've just picked it up off the satellite during the break.
[01:26:33.047 --> 01:26:33.948]  Breaking news!
[01:26:34.748 --> 01:26:41.913]  We now have had no global warming according to the remote sensing systems satellites which monitor global warming around the world.
[01:26:42.174 --> 01:26:48.258]  We haven't had any global warming at all for 17 years and 10 months.
[01:26:48.839 --> 01:26:53.142]  And the significance of that figure is that it's over half the entire
[01:26:53.602 --> 01:26:56.465]  Satellite measurement of global temperatures.
[01:26:56.525 --> 01:26:57.666]  It started in 1979.
[01:26:58.586 --> 01:27:03.971]  For over half of that period, the last half, there has been no global warming at all.
[01:27:04.231 --> 01:27:07.834]  So if anybody ever tells you, ooh, but look at all these extreme weather events.
[01:27:07.854 --> 01:27:09.535]  We've got a hurricane on the 4th of July.
[01:27:09.755 --> 01:27:11.637]  We've got all these things that have never happened before.
[01:27:11.657 --> 01:27:12.878]  Of course, they have all happened before.
[01:27:13.318 --> 01:27:19.764]  The one thing we know didn't cause them is global warming because there hasn't been any.
[01:27:19.924 --> 01:27:22.166]  And it's really as simple as that, Alex.
[01:27:23.010 --> 01:27:25.031]  Wow, and we've got a long segment coming up.
[01:27:25.051 --> 01:27:31.836]  You're going to get into this ridiculous challenge, another hoax, where they say everyone agrees that climate change is real.
[01:27:32.076 --> 01:27:34.317]  Well, of course, climate change is always going on.
[01:27:34.617 --> 01:27:37.159]  Doesn't mean you pay the UN a tax to stop it.
[01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:47.506]  Well, Alex, you're too young to remember, but climate change has been going on for 4.5 thousand million years, ever since the world began.
[01:27:48.246 --> 01:27:53.069]  And the fact that they're now saying, oh, we've discovered it's real and everybody's got to agree with us.
[01:27:53.369 --> 01:27:56.110]  Everybody has always agreed that climate change is real.
[01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:59.292]  And I wrote to this professor, a fellow called Keating.
[01:28:00.332 --> 01:28:03.814]  And I said to him, look, we all accept climate change is real.
[01:28:04.034 --> 01:28:05.255]  We all accept also...
[01:28:06.235 --> 01:28:09.556]  That humans can have some effect on the climate.
[01:28:09.856 --> 01:28:13.797]  The question is, did they have a lot of effect or a dangerous effect?
[01:28:13.837 --> 01:28:15.057]  That's what the debate's about.
[01:28:15.517 --> 01:28:20.839]  But he won't frame the question in a way that is fair or sensible.
[01:28:21.099 --> 01:28:28.221]  And also, he insisted on not allowing an independent third party to judge the competition.
[01:28:28.241 --> 01:28:29.041]  Because he's God.
[01:28:29.861 --> 01:28:31.301]  Because he wants to judge it himself.
[01:28:32.021 --> 01:28:34.002]  He's not going to give the money to anyone.
[01:28:34.262 --> 01:28:41.043]  It doesn't matter what evidence you produce, he's just going to say, you're a sceptic, I don't believe in your evidence, therefore I'm not giving you the prize.
[01:28:41.063 --> 01:28:42.484]  He's done it to several people already.
[01:28:43.124 --> 01:28:46.644]  So, of course it's not a real challenge, it's a bogus challenge.
[01:28:46.684 --> 01:28:52.886]  It's one that the left can then report on all their websites, the Daily Kos and the Huffington Puffington.
[01:28:53.106 --> 01:28:54.126]  All these places are...
[01:28:55.066 --> 01:28:59.129]  Talking about it, but the fact is that it's just another stunt.
[01:28:59.169 --> 01:29:03.011]  You mentioned that word in an earlier segment, sir, and Alex, and you're quite right.
[01:29:03.331 --> 01:29:09.055]  What goes on is that the left increasingly governed by stunt, because they can't govern on the basis of the fact.
[01:29:09.695 --> 01:29:12.657]  And the facts are, certainly on the global warming thing now,
[01:29:13.237 --> 01:29:19.719]  That it hasn't been warming for something like nearly 18 years according to the satellites.
[01:29:20.199 --> 01:29:38.443]  Probably more like 14 years according to the terrestrial measurements which of course are badly influenced by urban heat island effects with people turning on their electricity that heats up the area around cities and gives you an artificial... And by the kleptocrats putting the measurements out on black tarmacs to manipulate data.
[01:29:40.085 --> 01:29:41.546]  Stay there, we'll be right back, Lord Monckton.

[01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:49.675]  We're gonna get to the big breaking news coming up.
[01:29:49.695 --> 01:29:50.536]  There's some big news.
[01:29:51.617 --> 01:29:52.518]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.998 --> 01:29:54.600]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.541 --> 01:29:58.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.626 --> 01:30:08.591]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:08.792 --> 01:30:12.995]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:13.356 --> 01:30:17.920]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.942]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:21.262 --> 01:30:26.445]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:26.706 --> 01:30:33.590]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:37.853]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:38.233 --> 01:30:43.016]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:43.336 --> 01:30:44.197]  This is innovating.
[01:30:44.457 --> 01:30:51.786]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[01:31:12.605 --> 01:31:19.688]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:31:20.168 --> 01:31:24.450]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:34.974]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:31:35.395 --> 01:31:41.557]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:32:02.119 --> 01:32:06.121]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:10.323]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:32:10.523 --> 01:32:13.945]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:32:14.185 --> 01:32:17.066]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:32:17.226 --> 01:32:24.590]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:28.432]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:32:28.712 --> 01:32:32.953]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:32:33.113 --> 01:32:39.055]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:42.855]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:32:43.035 --> 01:32:45.576]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:32:45.776 --> 01:32:47.096]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:32:47.256 --> 01:32:48.517]  It's time to take action.
[01:32:48.637 --> 01:32:50.357]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:33:03.401 --> 01:33:09.124]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[01:33:11.144 --> 01:33:17.167]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[01:33:17.187 --> 01:33:20.228]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.288 --> 01:33:23.569]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:26.811]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[01:33:35.897 --> 01:33:37.278]  George Strait bringing us in.
[01:33:44.362 --> 01:33:49.805]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be here with a special 4th of July global transmission tomorrow.
[01:33:51.118 --> 01:33:53.740]  And then back this Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:59.183]  Central Standard Time with the Sunday Worldwide Broadcast as well.
[01:34:01.625 --> 01:34:10.311]  Lord Monckton is our guest and I wanted him to continue getting into the specifics of this professor.
[01:34:10.671 --> 01:34:12.372]  Think climate change isn't man-made?
[01:34:12.652 --> 01:34:13.253]  Then prove it!
[01:34:13.293 --> 01:34:17.696]  Professor offers $30,000 reward for anyone who can disprove his theory.
[01:34:18.516 --> 01:34:24.140]  Texas-based professor has issued a challenge, I want to send my reporters down there, to climate change deniers.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:25.981]  See, Holocaust deniers.
[01:34:26.641 --> 01:34:35.827]  Dr. Keating is offering 17,500 pounds, or roughly $30,000, to anyone that can disprove the theory that human activity is warming the planet.
[01:34:36.347 --> 01:34:40.470]  He is so sure of his claim that he is not expected to pay out anytime soon.
[01:34:41.576 --> 01:34:45.038]  Anyone can enter the competition and the work doesn't need to be original.
[01:34:45.378 --> 01:34:48.681]  Dr. Keating says he will be the final judge on winning or losing the entries.
[01:34:48.701 --> 01:34:49.381]  That's the Daily Mail.
[01:34:51.302 --> 01:34:57.546]  You know, what a sick joke for this, quote, Texas professor.
[01:34:57.566 --> 01:35:07.112]  That'd be like if I said, yeah, you can enter a contest to prove that this guy, you know, isn't a knuckle-dragging fraud.
[01:35:08.692 --> 01:35:11.374]  But there isn't an impartial group of judges here.
[01:35:11.975 --> 01:35:13.055]  No, I will judge.
[01:35:15.537 --> 01:35:17.119]  Because I know you're full of baloney.
[01:35:17.499 --> 01:35:19.841]  I mean, no one would buy tickets to that.
[01:35:20.001 --> 01:35:22.083]  No one would say that wasn't rigged.
[01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:34.732]  It's like Al Gore, famously, I have this in the film Endgame, going, no one doubts, not one scientist on Earth, that man-made global warming is real and is going to flood everybody by 2013, and that the Arctic will be completely melted.
[01:35:34.752 --> 01:35:36.614]  Of course, it didn't happen, it got bigger than ever.
[01:35:38.396 --> 01:35:46.482]  And then one congressman goes, excuse me, gotta play that clip again, I forget which congressman goes, excuse me, it isn't all the scientists, there's thousands.
[01:35:47.723 --> 01:35:51.786]  And a bunch of the people in the UPC report, they say they never were actually in that report.
[01:35:53.167 --> 01:35:57.751]  Well, congressman, there are people who believe we didn't go to the moon, too.
[01:35:57.811 --> 01:36:00.473]  I'm not talking about, I'm talking about credible scientists.
[01:36:01.174 --> 01:36:08.059]  And the congressman's like, listen, there are a bunch of people who weren't in that report who say their names were put on it.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:09.621]  Uh-huh!
[01:36:09.801 --> 01:36:11.002]  Aliens are going to get me!
[01:36:11.562 --> 01:36:17.787]  Like when Jesse Ventura, the former governor, goes and talks to the congressman and goes, I have your bill here for civil unrest and FEMA camps for Americans.
[01:36:18.007 --> 01:36:18.988]  He goes, no, there's no bill.
[01:36:19.268 --> 01:36:21.529]  I don't believe space aliens are going to come out of machines and eat me.
[01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:24.131]  That's their response.
[01:36:24.752 --> 01:36:26.593]  And again, the Republicans have been horrible.
[01:36:27.854 --> 01:36:30.496]  But now the Democrats are going for a total takeover.
[01:36:30.516 --> 01:36:32.738]  So, Lord Monckton, I want to get into this professor.
[01:36:33.038 --> 01:36:35.560]  People should go visit him, where he's a professor.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.902]  I'll tell folks where he's a professor in a moment.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:41.061]  But, I mean, these stunts have got to be called.
[01:36:41.101 --> 01:36:45.483]  I mean, the media is reporting on him like, well, see, he disproved it.
[01:36:45.543 --> 01:36:46.943]  You know, he's the judge and he's the winner.
[01:36:47.264 --> 01:36:50.425]  Don't people see through this as a joke?
[01:36:51.645 --> 01:36:55.807]  Because nearly all the media are on the far left nowadays.
[01:36:55.827 --> 01:36:57.808]  You know, you're an honorable exception.
[01:36:57.828 --> 01:37:00.569]  You're so far on the far right, you've almost fallen off the edge.
[01:37:00.789 --> 01:37:06.712]  But, I mean, all the far left media, they are doing their best to
[01:37:08.513 --> 01:37:13.295]  Give the New World Order every favour they can.
[01:37:13.335 --> 01:37:19.458]  And when I say New World Order, I'm not just using a vague right-wing, reds-under-the-beds phrase.
[01:37:19.878 --> 01:37:26.722]  At Paris next year, next December, they're going to make the next really big attempt
[01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:29.912]  To introduce a world government treaty.
[01:37:30.512 --> 01:37:34.714]  Now, in Copenhagen a few years ago, 2009, they made the mistake of publishing it first.
[01:37:35.534 --> 01:37:36.074]  On the web.
[01:37:36.775 --> 01:37:41.157]  Where a colleague of mine found it, Dr. Willie Soon, at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
[01:37:41.597 --> 01:37:42.397]  He sent it to me.
[01:37:42.917 --> 01:37:46.139]  I publicized it, first all over Canada, then all over the United States.
[01:37:46.499 --> 01:37:48.720]  The video in which I mentioned it went viral.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.400]  Two million people had seen it in a week.
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.081]  I mean, it was huge!
[01:37:51.581 --> 01:37:54.722]  Still the fastest YouTube platinum for any political speech.
[01:37:55.462 --> 01:37:56.423]  And then what happened?
[01:37:56.983 --> 01:38:05.925]  Was they paid for a dozen bogus pages on the web, which contained somewhere within them the words Monkton Video.
[01:38:06.265 --> 01:38:16.888]  They paid each of the search engines to put these bogus pages of complete gibberish that nobody would have wanted to read, it was just strings of letters and numbers, over and above the video that had had two million hits.
[01:38:17.188 --> 01:38:20.229]  That cost them, according to an expert who got in touch with me about it,
[01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:30.652]  Not less than a quarter of a million dollars just to silence one person making one speech about their planned proposal to take over the world using the Climate Treaty as an excuse.
[01:38:31.453 --> 01:38:33.433]  What then happened, Alex, is really fascinating.
[01:38:33.533 --> 01:38:40.336]  In Melbourne, Australia, a left-wing radio station decided that I was just a right-wing kook.
[01:38:40.956 --> 01:38:46.858]  They sent a copy of the draft Treaty of Copenhagen to a Queen's Council, a senior attorney.
[01:38:47.765 --> 01:38:59.927]  And they said to him, please will you read this for us, and will you tell us whether or not Lord Monckton is right to say that they're trying to set up a world government that isn't elected?
[01:39:00.587 --> 01:39:04.368]  And it's going to be a real world government, and do they use the word government in the treaty?
[01:39:05.228 --> 01:39:08.649]  And so, you know, they were sneering, they thought it wouldn't turn out to be real.
[01:39:09.129 --> 01:39:13.390]  The Queen's Council, the senior attorney, came back to them and he said, look, he said,
[01:39:14.235 --> 01:39:15.596]  Munton has got it wrong.
[01:39:16.476 --> 01:39:19.538]  It is ten times worse than anything he said.
[01:39:20.458 --> 01:39:37.927]  This is a bid to take over the world and to stamp out democracy everywhere and to have a single, central, global government using the environment and the climate simply as a fig leaf behind which this new tyranny by Clarke will be extended worldwide.
[01:39:37.947 --> 01:39:39.388]  The EU has already done it in Europe.
[01:39:39.788 --> 01:39:41.870]  Now they're going to make it go worldwide.
[01:39:41.890 --> 01:40:00.106]  There are EU advisors telling the UN how to grab power by making sure that each new treaty by which power is handed over by usually left-wing governments to international bodies that nobody elects is kept secret from the people until after it has been signed.
[01:40:00.926 --> 01:40:03.667]  And that's the technique that the European Union has used.
[01:40:04.147 --> 01:40:08.249]  I once spent years trying to get hold of a copy of what eventually became the Treaty of Maastricht.
[01:40:08.349 --> 01:40:17.552]  I eventually got the first copy in the country and began writing about it and the Foreign Office denied that any such document existed.
[01:40:18.413 --> 01:40:22.837]  And so I produced photocopies of it, I put it up on the newspaper I was writing for, The Evening Standard.
[01:40:23.218 --> 01:40:27.242]  They still went on pretending it existed, and two years later, they signed it.
[01:40:27.262 --> 01:40:27.722]  Incredible.
[01:40:27.742 --> 01:40:37.412]  Lord Monckton, let's go to the model of Australia, and talk about UKIP some, because, you know, taking not just the United States, but the world back, Australia back,
[01:40:38.493 --> 01:40:47.820]  If I remember correctly, they then demonized you in an attack piece, backfiring in TV and print articles all over Australia.
[01:40:48.381 --> 01:41:06.116]  That then caused you to be a cause celeb, you traveled Australia repeatedly, toured the country, speaking to packed halls of tens of thousands, debated people on television, and now they're set and say they have the votes, we'll put it on screen, next week to repeal the carbon tax that's been devastating Australian farmers, factories, you name it,
[01:41:06.676 --> 01:41:07.156]  I don't know.
[01:41:23.965 --> 01:41:28.087]  Parachuted into the meeting, which was a stunt, fighting stunts with stunts.
[01:41:28.667 --> 01:41:35.130]  And again, it's just an example of taking action, perseverance, what it can do.
[01:41:35.631 --> 01:41:37.451]  We're gaining ground against them.
[01:41:37.471 --> 01:41:41.173]  Do you disagree with that statement and elaborate on what happened in Australia?
[01:41:41.413 --> 01:41:44.054]  Because if they repeal it, this is a stunning victory.
[01:41:44.535 --> 01:41:49.077]  Because I briefed Tony Abbott, who's now the Prime Minister, oh, three or four years ago,
[01:41:49.537 --> 01:41:50.178]  At his request.
[01:41:50.238 --> 01:41:51.399]  I was in Canberra.
[01:41:51.419 --> 01:41:54.182]  I got a message from his office saying, please call in whenever you can.
[01:41:54.202 --> 01:41:58.226]  And so I went there and had half an hour with him and we talked through this climate thing.
[01:41:58.686 --> 01:42:05.273]  And he said, look, I've got to be very careful, because there are those in my party who think this is a problem.
[01:42:05.293 --> 01:42:09.837]  He said, I don't really think it is, but I have to be very careful how I play it.
[01:42:10.838 --> 01:42:17.403]  He said, it's quite clear that even if it were a problem, having carbon taxes is not the solution to the problem.
[01:42:17.783 --> 01:42:28.932]  And that's the rather crafty way in which he's managed to persuade his own party that they should stand with him and oppose the carbon tax, because even if there were a problem, the carbon tax is not a good solution to it.
[01:42:29.692 --> 01:42:31.874]  And so, he's a very, very good man.
[01:42:31.894 --> 01:42:36.898]  He does a lot of, privately, a lot of good works, quietly, which he doesn't publicise.
[01:42:37.779 --> 01:42:40.080]  A very, very unusual politician.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:43.421]  And I'm hoping he'll be the Prime Minister there for a very long time.
[01:42:43.441 --> 01:42:45.382]  The left, of course, absolutely loathe him.
[01:42:46.162 --> 01:42:53.766]  And because he has said that the climate thing is all nonsense, that he and Stephen Harper in Canada are the two who have stood out against this nonsense.
[01:42:54.126 --> 01:42:56.287]  And as it happens, I've briefed both of them on this.
[01:42:56.707 --> 01:43:02.029]  All it needs is for these leaders to meet Moncton, and they change their view on the climate, Alex.
[01:43:03.385 --> 01:43:04.466]  It's simply amazing.
[01:43:05.066 --> 01:43:11.351]  I want to shift gears back to this professor because the media is besmirching my great state by saying he's a Texas professor.
[01:43:11.671 --> 01:43:14.833]  He's actually from the Naval War College sneaking around here.
[01:43:15.434 --> 01:43:20.998]  And that's another issue that they've had the Navy, the Marines, the Army putting out climate hysteria.
[01:43:21.258 --> 01:43:26.542]  They've had NASA scientists putting out stuff, you know, to fear monger and then using the name.
[01:43:26.562 --> 01:43:28.704]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:43:29.967 --> 01:43:30.287]  It is.
[01:43:30.407 --> 01:43:48.441]  I think that this professor with his silly scare, I wrote to him on his website and I said, look, are you prepared to have an independent third party judge, preferably a real judge, who's used to assessing evidence fairly on both sides of a case, and oh no, he was not.
[01:43:48.501 --> 01:43:50.482]  He ran a mile from that.
[01:43:50.883 --> 01:43:52.284]  This man is frightened.
[01:43:52.704 --> 01:43:57.908]  He knows perfectly well that if there were any independent trial of this matter,
[01:43:58.388 --> 01:43:59.649]  He knows perfectly well who would win.
[01:43:59.669 --> 01:44:02.650]  In fact, I'm now working with TV producers in Canada.
[01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:06.052]  And we are going to put global warming on trial.
[01:44:06.852 --> 01:44:11.795]  And we're going to have a real judge, probably a retired one, but a real one, in a real courtroom.
[01:44:12.588 --> 01:44:19.214]  We're going to have... I'm going to be the prosecutor of global warming, and they've said their difficulties in finding anybody who will now defend it.
[01:44:19.834 --> 01:44:22.696]  So I've given them a few names that I think might be prepared to defend it.
[01:44:23.217 --> 01:44:25.459]  We're each going to be allowed to choose our own witnesses.
[01:44:25.719 --> 01:44:27.801]  There will be a fairly chosen jury.
[01:44:28.541 --> 01:44:31.003]  And what we're going to do is we're going to put this in a theatre.
[01:44:31.804 --> 01:44:38.430]  And the idea is that then in this theatre, every night, there will be a two-hour courtroom drama, effectively.
[01:44:38.490 --> 01:44:39.230]  Great idea.
[01:44:39.751 --> 01:44:43.814]  And the case will be argued before a jury chosen from that night's audience.
[01:44:43.854 --> 01:44:46.537]  They get their money back if they agree to come on to the jury.
[01:44:47.237 --> 01:44:52.562]  And the jury will then have, hear the evidence, and they'll have to be honest and try to decide it.
[01:44:52.982 --> 01:44:57.146]  That's bold to do it in Canada, because they've really bought a lot of the brainwashing up there.
[01:44:57.674 --> 01:45:00.355]  But what is interesting is that the ordinary people haven't.
[01:45:00.716 --> 01:45:04.418]  As always, it's the chattering classes that have bought into this because they're making money out of it.
[01:45:04.458 --> 01:45:06.459]  Alex, you and I know this is what it's really all about.
[01:45:06.959 --> 01:45:13.683]  Obama supports this whole nonsense because it means he can shut down his opponent's biggest funders.
[01:45:13.943 --> 01:45:15.684]  That's what he's doing it for.
[01:45:16.184 --> 01:45:19.066]  China is now just beginning to change its tune on this.
[01:45:19.106 --> 01:45:21.327]  It was previously completely against it because
[01:45:21.827 --> 01:45:24.849]  It wants to compete with the West for natural resources.
[01:45:24.869 --> 01:45:26.530]  It doesn't need to sell its products to us.
[01:45:26.850 --> 01:45:29.271]  It needs to be able to have enough natural resources to make them.
[01:45:29.331 --> 01:45:30.251]  That's its biggest need.
[01:45:30.552 --> 01:45:34.173]  We're its biggest competitors to get the supplies to keep their industries going.
[01:45:34.574 --> 01:45:37.435]  If they can shut the West down, that suits them fine.
[01:45:37.675 --> 01:45:39.296]  So now they're backing climate change.
[01:45:39.556 --> 01:45:42.718]  Putin is backing climate change, again for purely financial reasons.
[01:45:42.738 --> 01:45:50.722]  He wants to sell lots of overpriced Siberian methane gas to heat the towns and cities of Western Europe through the pipeline that runs through the region.
[01:45:50.862 --> 01:45:55.143]  Foreigners are siding with Obama to literally shut off half our energy source.
[01:45:55.744 --> 01:45:56.904]  Is that not treason?
[01:45:57.464 --> 01:46:01.745]  I mean, in World War II, our fighter bombers blew up German power plants and facilities.
[01:46:02.806 --> 01:46:09.768]  I mean, Obama and your government shutting down power plants is doing what bombers couldn't do to us.
[01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:13.941]  Well, this is exactly what's happening, but of course he did say he was going to do it.
[01:46:14.382 --> 01:46:17.306]  He was very open about it, and the left often are.
[01:46:17.506 --> 01:46:22.232]  They will often say, yes, we're going to have a war on coal, this is a dirty industry, we're going to shut it down.
[01:46:22.573 --> 01:46:25.196]  What was interesting was that 40 years ago in Britain,
[01:46:25.757 --> 01:46:27.139]  Well, I worked for Margaret Thatcher.
[01:46:27.679 --> 01:46:31.703]  At that time, the coal industry was the great industry of the future.
[01:46:31.723 --> 01:46:34.166]  The miners were the heroes of labour.
[01:46:34.486 --> 01:46:35.948]  I mean, they still are for me.
[01:46:36.508 --> 01:46:39.331]  Going down a deep mine in Britain was a very dangerous and dirty job.
[01:46:39.391 --> 01:46:41.153]  I was a huge admirer of the miners.
[01:46:41.193 --> 01:46:44.036]  But the left put them right up on a pedestal.
[01:46:44.316 --> 01:46:46.959]  When the miners went on strike against the Thatcher government,
[01:46:47.239 --> 01:46:50.340]  There wasn't a word from the left about how coal is a dirty fuel.
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:59.864]  No, but they changed their tune when they realised that the coal industries, particularly in places like the United States, were the ones that were bankrolling their political opponents in the Republican Party.
[01:46:59.884 --> 01:47:00.484]  So what do we do?
[01:47:00.724 --> 01:47:03.565]  We find an excuse, a totalitarian excuse,
[01:47:04.165 --> 01:47:07.228]  To have a war on coal and shut down the coal industry.
[01:47:07.269 --> 01:47:14.016]  Now, modern coal-fired power plants, you burn the coal at very, very high temperatures, so you get very, very little pollution.
[01:47:14.296 --> 01:47:17.920]  You trap the ash on the way out, and you don't get much pollution.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:19.701]  It's actually as clean as burning gas.
[01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:26.533]  The only thing it gives off is about twice as much CO2 as gas, but CO2 is a harmless trace gas.
[01:47:26.573 --> 01:47:27.594]  It is the stuff of life.
[01:47:27.954 --> 01:47:38.142]  So what this is about, and this is why Paris is such a worrying thing, is that they are planning now to have this world government treaty put in place in Paris, and this time
[01:47:38.482 --> 01:47:42.986]  They won't let the likes of me see the draft of that treaty in advance, and I can tell you how I know that.
[01:47:43.486 --> 01:47:52.554]  Because in 2012, I went to the Doha Conference, where they finally banned me for life for telling them there'd be no global warming at that stage for 16 years.
[01:47:52.614 --> 01:47:53.876]  Now it's going on for 18 years.
[01:47:54.676 --> 01:47:55.657]  And they banned me for life.
[01:47:55.697 --> 01:47:56.738]  They didn't want that said.
[01:47:57.679 --> 01:48:03.144]  And when I was there, I was trying to get a copy of what are called the draft conclusions from the chair.
[01:48:04.318 --> 01:48:08.082]  And this is essentially what are the main points this conference was going to decide.
[01:48:09.183 --> 01:48:17.291]  And at all previous conferences, this had been publicly available, you would go and ask it from the document centre or press office, they had plenty of copies, you would just ask for one.
[01:48:17.311 --> 01:48:21.655]  I asked for it and they pretended no such thing existed or had ever existed.
[01:48:22.416 --> 01:48:24.277]  They're driving it all underground.
[01:48:25.078 --> 01:48:29.680]  All these documents, all these negotiations that were once open and public, they're now secret.
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:33.541]  All the documents to do with those negotiations, once public, are now secret.
[01:48:33.561 --> 01:48:34.662]  And do you know why?
[01:48:35.322 --> 01:48:47.686]  Because at the Durban conference, the one I had to parachute in from 10,000 feet, I'd never skydived in my life before, I thought, well, all I can do is hit the ground, and the real danger is missing, because I've got Irish ancestry.
[01:48:47.706 --> 01:48:49.207]  But I was all right, I hit the ground all right.
[01:48:49.827 --> 01:48:52.068]  And what was there at that Durban conference?
[01:48:52.528 --> 01:48:57.631]  When I got the copy of the draft conclusions from the chair, it was just bonkers.
[01:48:58.471 --> 01:49:05.334]  They were advocating reducing the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere from 400 parts per million to 200.
[01:49:05.514 --> 01:49:12.478]  Now, at 200 parts per million, most plants and trees on Earth would either die or struggle to survive.
[01:49:13.138 --> 01:49:14.899]  Crop yields would fall by up to 50%.
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:18.342]  And they were advocating this as a necessary measure.
[01:49:18.402 --> 01:49:20.804]  Wouldn't that kill a billion people, it's estimated, in a decade?
[01:49:21.304 --> 01:49:25.707]  It would have killed probably 5 billion of the 6 billion people then on Earth.
[01:49:25.767 --> 01:49:26.608]  It's 7 billion now.
[01:49:26.908 --> 01:49:29.250]  It would have killed something like 5 or 6 billion.
[01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:31.291]  It was an extraordinary policy.
[01:49:31.812 --> 01:49:39.297]  They wanted to set up an international climate court, which was going to try Western countries and... So it was the old plan that would kill a million.
[01:49:39.317 --> 01:49:40.138]  They had one even worse.
[01:49:40.874 --> 01:49:43.676]  And all of this was in this treaty draft.
[01:49:44.097 --> 01:49:45.137]  2,000 journalists were there.
[01:49:45.738 --> 01:49:54.905]  Not one newspaper or news medium around the world reported what was in... Well, how are we going to get the intel out of Paris then?
[01:49:54.925 --> 01:49:55.866]  We're going to have to have moles.
[01:49:56.366 --> 01:50:03.590]  I can't get in, of course, they've banned me for life, but I have got people who are going to get in there, whether they like it or not, and they'll be feeding stuff out to me.
[01:50:03.610 --> 01:50:13.355]  The trouble is, that even inside the conference, they will be doing their best to keep these documents secret, until they've got them signed and agreed to by the... Well, criminals always try to operate in secret.
[01:50:13.415 --> 01:50:17.917]  In closing, tell us about the Las Vegas Summit coming up.
[01:50:18.408 --> 01:50:19.388]  This is very important.
[01:50:19.749 --> 01:50:34.794]  Next week, from the 7th to the 9th of July, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Resort and Casino, the biggest resort in the whole of Las Vegas, right in the centre of town, there's going to be the 9th Heartland International Climate Conference.
[01:50:35.234 --> 01:50:39.177]  Now, if you haven't registered to go to this conference yet, you have just about got time.
[01:50:39.217 --> 01:50:42.999]  You really will need to be quick, because there's going to be about a thousand people there.
[01:50:43.019 --> 01:50:44.020]  It's a huge event.
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:47.802]  It's the biggest skeptical climate conference anywhere in the world.
[01:50:48.142 --> 01:50:58.269]  And we are going to be telling the world that there is nothing like as much to worry about as those profiteers of doom have been trying to... All right, great job, Lord Monckton.
[01:50:58.309 --> 01:50:59.950]  We appreciate all of your time.

[01:52:04.203 --> 01:52:12.051]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:52:12.151 --> 01:52:19.179]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:52:19.679 --> 01:52:23.904]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say that's good stuff.
[01:52:24.224 --> 01:52:34.306]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:52:34.766 --> 01:52:40.868]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:52:41.208 --> 01:52:43.428]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[01:53:03.489 --> 01:53:04.629]  The day grows dark.
[01:53:05.169 --> 01:53:12.652]  As ominous clouds move in, and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky, and you realize you are not prepared.
[01:53:12.672 --> 01:53:14.352]  I am telling you to take cover!
[01:53:14.372 --> 01:53:18.113]  The number of intense storms is increasing exponentially in the U.S.
[01:53:18.434 --> 01:53:24.215]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts are happening with greater magnitude and frequency.
[01:53:24.496 --> 01:53:28.597]  If you are choosing to rely on the government to save you... And no one's coming to help them.
[01:53:28.817 --> 01:53:30.158]  You could be dead wrong.

[01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:23.368]  If you don't have storable food now,
[01:55:23.948 --> 01:55:25.029]  You're insane, in my view.
[01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:28.630]  And the sponsor of the show also helps fund the operation.
[01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:34.513]  And don't forget, we do have the new shirt in 1776 Molon Lambe.
[01:55:34.593 --> 01:55:38.695]  It's got the joiner die with crossed M16s there.
[01:55:38.715 --> 01:55:40.475]  And that's a Cade design.
[01:55:40.535 --> 01:55:42.076]  I didn't design that shirt, but I love it.
[01:55:42.556 --> 01:55:44.297]  And it's got other great messages as well.
[01:55:44.717 --> 01:55:46.178]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:55:46.498 --> 01:55:48.599]  And your purchases make the broadcast possible.
[01:55:48.999 --> 01:55:50.480]  Okay, let's go to Nathan.
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:52.560]  No, no, Nathan's up next.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:54.861]  Let's go to, uh, who was holding the longest there?
[01:55:55.541 --> 01:55:56.761]  Derrick in Kentucky.
[01:55:57.161 --> 01:55:58.281]  The great state of Kentucky.
[01:55:58.321 --> 01:55:58.922]  You're on the air.
[01:55:58.962 --> 01:55:59.342]  Go ahead.
[01:56:00.362 --> 01:56:00.922]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:00.962 --> 01:56:02.002]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:56:02.262 --> 01:56:03.923]  I have a lot of respect for what you're doing there.
[01:56:04.803 --> 01:56:05.883]  Brother, we're all in it together.
[01:56:05.923 --> 01:56:06.843]  I respect you as well.
[01:56:07.263 --> 01:56:07.903]  What's on your mind?
[01:56:08.604 --> 01:56:11.904]  Well, I've, uh, I've noticed the news really speedballing lately.
[01:56:12.264 --> 01:56:17.005]  Economic experts are calling for something worse than 2008 in our near future.
[01:56:17.785 --> 01:56:20.446]  The gates to the states are hanging wide open in the South.
[01:56:21.364 --> 01:56:25.886]  A good friend of mine sells the chemicals they're putting in my local water supply, so I know those are there.
[01:56:26.906 --> 01:56:32.288]  And here lately in Kentucky, over the last few months, I'm noticing the skies are looking a lot different than what they used to.
[01:56:32.308 --> 01:56:36.650]  And in fact, yesterday, a plane went overhead of me and dropped a plume like I've never seen before.
[01:56:37.450 --> 01:56:48.594]  I'm wondering at this point, if it's not too far late, too far gone, why folks by the millions aren't standing out in front of Capitol buildings, state and federal, all over the nation, demanding answers, and what we can do at this point.
[01:56:50.073 --> 01:57:00.957]  It's just totally overwhelming that the Energy Department admits in their high-altitude aerosol campaign, they don't call it chemtrails, there's no documents on chemtrails, there's tens of thousands on weather modification.
[01:57:01.017 --> 01:57:01.998]  Bill Gates is over it.
[01:57:02.598 --> 01:57:04.999]  He gets paid by the government to run the operations.
[01:57:05.019 --> 01:57:07.140]  He makes billions, his company does, tax-free.
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:14.763]  They're involved in weather modification, manipulation, they've been caught spraying biologicals on people, and they admit all this.
[01:57:14.803 --> 01:57:17.444]  It's even in the news, but it's like, oh, they're secret tests, never mind.
[01:57:19.271 --> 01:57:21.652]  So you mention that, it sounds crazy, because it is crazy.
[01:57:22.172 --> 01:57:31.034]  We're in 2014, it's like a science fiction movie, and now all these stratospheric sulfate aerosols, geoengineering.
[01:57:31.594 --> 01:57:33.055]  There's a headline right there from Wikipedia.
[01:57:33.495 --> 01:57:35.295]  So all of this is going on.
[01:57:35.675 --> 01:57:38.176]  We know what's going on, we just don't know exactly the full extent.
[01:57:38.196 --> 01:57:42.017]  It's like you know your neighbor's killing people and burying them, you just don't know how many are buried.
[01:57:42.057 --> 01:57:43.137]  I mean, it's bad.
[01:57:43.757 --> 01:57:45.638]  It's always, always worse than I thought.
[01:57:46.684 --> 01:57:48.285]  Because it's compartmentalization.
[01:57:48.365 --> 01:57:53.889]  So, people have just been raised in a trench, and they're starting to break out of it.
[01:57:53.909 --> 01:57:55.470]  That's why the armored vehicles are coming out.
[01:57:55.730 --> 01:58:01.234]  That's why the gloves are coming off, the velvet gloves coming off the iron fist.
[01:58:02.194 --> 01:58:03.715]  So, I'm in the same boat as you.
[01:58:03.835 --> 01:58:15.263]  I mean, it's just crazy town that the government has opened the borders and is flooding us, but then you go to the airport and they want to stick their hands down your pants and the NSA spies on you.
[01:58:16.257 --> 01:58:17.238]  Now there's ABC News.
[01:58:17.278 --> 01:58:18.799]  Bill Gates, the hurricane tamer.
[01:58:19.119 --> 01:58:20.080]  He's saving us.
[01:58:21.521 --> 01:58:22.461]  So there you go.
[01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:30.607]  And the reason I went off on the climate manipulation is... I say it's admitted, the new listeners think I'm nuts.
[01:58:30.727 --> 01:58:38.092]  I mean, literally there are hundreds of patents from the 50s and 60s on total weather control.
[01:58:38.772 --> 01:58:39.953]  And it's all going on now.
[01:58:41.067 --> 01:58:41.688]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:41.708 --> 01:58:43.070]  I'm going to go right to your calls.
[01:58:44.292 --> 01:58:44.712]  Nathan.
[01:58:44.812 --> 01:58:46.715]  This is GCN, the Genesis News Radio Network.
[01:58:46.735 --> 01:58:50.741]  Then we're going to go to Derek, Dre, and a bunch of others.
[01:58:52.182 --> 01:58:59.246]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:58:59.346 --> 01:59:01.488]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:59:01.688 --> 01:59:06.791]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:59:06.971 --> 01:59:12.014]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:59:12.134 --> 01:59:15.176]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:59:15.436 --> 01:59:19.320]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:23.743]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:59:23.844 --> 01:59:33.892]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[01:59:34.073 --> 01:59:36.595]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs.
[01:59:36.715 --> 01:59:37.636]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:37.656 --> 01:59:39.297]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:08.277 --> 02:00:12.442]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:13.122 --> 02:00:13.923]  You want answers?
[02:00:14.704 --> 02:00:15.625]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:16.246 --> 02:00:19.890]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:20.431 --> 02:00:24.495]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.231 --> 02:00:34.472]  There is just a ton of breaking news at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:00:34.512 --> 02:00:37.172]  I'll cover some of it, and then get to our guests in the next segment.
[02:00:37.972 --> 02:00:39.393]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[02:00:40.893 --> 02:00:41.753]  Who's up next, John?
[02:00:41.773 --> 02:00:44.153]  I know you've been going through the callers.
[02:00:44.173 --> 02:00:45.134]  Who should I go to next?
[02:00:45.154 --> 02:00:47.434]  I'm not going through the callers.
[02:00:47.474 --> 02:00:48.234]  We don't really screen them.
[02:00:48.254 --> 02:00:54.055]  When people have been on hold a while, he goes to make sure people are there, and then it changes the timer to see who's been holding the longest.
[02:00:54.955 --> 02:00:56.936]  Let's talk to Seth in Ohio.
[02:00:57.376 --> 02:00:58.536]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:01:00.077 --> 02:01:06.379]  Hi Alex, I'm Seth from FEMA Region 5, or formerly known as Ohio.
[02:01:06.399 --> 02:01:13.522]  I just wanted to go into a question, but first I wanted to let you know that everything that you say is rightful.
[02:01:15.055 --> 02:01:20.920]  Oh my gosh, you don't want Secret Geoengineering and Open Borders to take your guns?
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:28.145]  We're only buying armored vehicles, and the police are killing people that videotape them, and the foreign banks run us.
[02:01:28.625 --> 02:01:33.689]  I mean, my goodness, why don't you like everything you do being watched illegally?
[02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:35.150]  I'm liberal.
[02:01:35.551 --> 02:01:36.772]  I talk like this.
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:39.081]  Oh, man.
[02:01:39.101 --> 02:01:42.145]  Well, I wanted to ask you a question.
[02:01:42.525 --> 02:01:53.378]  I wanted to go out with a couple of my buddies and my girlfriend on the Fourth of July and pass out flyers to raise awareness of, you know, the Bill of Rights and
[02:01:54.028 --> 02:01:56.969]  You know, what rights people have as American citizens.
[02:01:57.049 --> 02:01:59.149]  And I was just looking for your professional opinion.
[02:01:59.249 --> 02:02:02.130]  Well, I think you should take some Prozac, drink some liquor.
[02:02:02.150 --> 02:02:03.011]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[02:02:03.031 --> 02:02:03.451]  Don't do that.
[02:02:04.151 --> 02:02:05.771]  And just do whatever you're told.
[02:02:05.811 --> 02:02:11.133]  Like Britney Spears says, do whatever our president says, or you're a homophobe racist.
[02:02:11.193 --> 02:02:11.653]  Okay?
[02:02:12.913 --> 02:02:13.994]  Do whatever I say.
[02:02:14.014 --> 02:02:16.634]  Give me all your money, or I'll say you're bad.
[02:02:17.015 --> 02:02:20.095]  And you don't want to not be under peer pressure.
[02:02:20.696 --> 02:02:21.856]  Do what you're told.
[02:02:24.639 --> 02:02:25.019]  No, no.
[02:02:25.419 --> 02:02:26.380]  I mean, that's a great idea.
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:30.142]  What should you do on the 4th of July to wake people up?
[02:02:30.842 --> 02:02:34.083]  I think if you've been fighting tyranny, you should relax and have a good time on the 4th of July.
[02:02:35.544 --> 02:02:41.507]  But if you haven't been, I mean, I would go out where they're going to have Army and National Guard and people at fireworks displays.
[02:02:41.767 --> 02:02:43.528]  It'll be open green fields like Austin.
[02:02:44.884 --> 02:02:49.868]  And a, quote, terrorist, ISIS, funded by the government, could come through at any point and blow people up.
[02:02:50.148 --> 02:02:56.093]  But they'll have a checkpoint just to train you and have an act of domination where you walk through and they search you.
[02:02:56.733 --> 02:03:03.099]  And so you should just go up and say, you know, if there was a real terrorist like ISIS our government runs, they would just blow up this line, the biggest concentration of people.
[02:03:03.399 --> 02:03:04.740]  Look, this whole field's wide open.
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:06.161]  Why is the army on here?
[02:03:06.401 --> 02:03:07.182]  Don't know, sir.
[02:03:07.462 --> 02:03:08.423]  Just trying to keep you safe.
[02:03:08.683 --> 02:03:11.866]  Well, listen, National Guardsmen, I'm not against you personally.
[02:03:12.586 --> 02:03:14.088]  But we should have a whole discussion about it.
[02:03:14.288 --> 02:03:15.829]  Come on sir, just let us go to the line.
[02:03:16.170 --> 02:03:17.571]  No, this is July 4th.
[02:03:17.832 --> 02:03:19.093]  No other country does this.
[02:03:19.313 --> 02:03:20.274]  This is a police state.
[02:03:20.554 --> 02:03:21.655]  Our government funds ISIS.
[02:03:22.648 --> 02:03:23.708]  That's the kind of stuff I'd do.
[02:03:24.128 --> 02:03:31.450]  I'd go up to these parks and stuff, you know, like last 4th of July that have signs saying, you know, no free speech, no demonstration.
[02:03:31.710 --> 02:03:32.810]  What was that sign yesterday about?
[02:03:33.130 --> 02:03:36.551]  You know, no dogs, no drinking, no loud talking in the park.
[02:03:36.611 --> 02:03:40.492]  I mean, this is literally a criminal government trying to train us to be good slaves.
[02:03:41.252 --> 02:03:45.673]  And trying to breed out of us basic human freedom.
[02:03:46.173 --> 02:03:50.814]  And they want you to act like a prisoner in a medium security prison.
[02:03:51.514 --> 02:03:52.657]  And so, there it is.
[02:03:52.697 --> 02:03:54.181]  First Amendment expression area.
[02:03:54.582 --> 02:03:57.409]  This has been set aside for individual groups exercising constitutional rights.
[02:03:57.870 --> 02:03:59.755]  Again, exercise it everywhere.
[02:04:00.697 --> 02:04:01.677]  Yeah, that's not the sign.
[02:04:01.697 --> 02:04:04.579]  There was a 4th of July sign that said you had no rights.
[02:04:05.039 --> 02:04:07.580]  So folks stuck another one up on it saying, yes you do.
[02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:09.041]  So, I don't know.
[02:04:09.121 --> 02:04:14.583]  I mean, I would go out and hang up signs saying, Homeland Security's here to destroy America and absorb the nation.
[02:04:14.763 --> 02:04:17.824]  Which I always said, it's the Immigrant Importation Agency.
[02:04:17.844 --> 02:04:22.106]  You know, it's no longer the Border Patrol.
[02:04:22.466 --> 02:04:23.447]  It's no longer ICE.
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:30.701]  It is literally the, uh, Homeland Security is the homeland, uh, immigration importation facility.
[02:04:30.961 --> 02:04:37.443]  So just go out, put up pro-gun signs, go to Kinko's today or some mom-and-pop place, print up a hundred flyers you make.
[02:04:37.463 --> 02:04:37.783]  There it is.
[02:04:38.083 --> 02:04:39.423]  July 4th, Park Rules.
[02:04:39.763 --> 02:04:41.144]  No generators or propane grills.
[02:04:41.204 --> 02:04:41.944]  No tents or shelters.
[02:04:42.204 --> 02:04:45.365]  Police will be conducting searches of bags and coolers for reasons of public safety.
[02:04:45.625 --> 02:04:47.065]  No alcoholic beverages at any time.
[02:04:47.725 --> 02:04:50.806]  No personal fireworks, including novelty fireworks or sparklers.
[02:04:51.046 --> 02:04:52.127]  No dogs or pets allowed.
[02:04:52.467 --> 02:04:56.288]  Skate park, baseball courts, tennis courts and Kids Cove will close at 7 p.m.
[02:04:56.348 --> 02:04:58.489]  Notice, the entire park under video surveillance.
[02:04:59.069 --> 02:05:01.190]  I mean, that's the North Korean 4th of July.
[02:05:03.032 --> 02:05:04.793]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:05:05.314 --> 02:05:12.278]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:05:12.738 --> 02:05:23.165]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:05:23.566 --> 02:05:32.812]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:05:33.532 --> 02:05:36.953]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:05:37.613 --> 02:05:41.033]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:05:41.354 --> 02:05:42.954]  Experience the new formula.
[02:05:43.414 --> 02:05:45.394]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:05:45.994 --> 02:05:47.015]  Shield your family.
[02:05:47.335 --> 02:05:48.735]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:05:49.135 --> 02:05:51.735]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.

[02:06:02.435 --> 02:06:03.516]  In the near future.
[02:06:03.776 --> 02:06:07.919]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:06:08.300 --> 02:06:09.301]  Security alert.
[02:06:09.521 --> 02:06:11.242]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:06:11.522 --> 02:06:12.143]  Analysis.
[02:06:12.403 --> 02:06:13.064]  InfoWars.
[02:06:13.124 --> 02:06:15.085]  Building independent media operations.
[02:06:15.105 --> 02:06:20.089]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:21.050]  Prime Directive.
[02:06:21.150 --> 02:06:22.531]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:22.691 --> 02:06:25.473]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:25.554 --> 02:06:28.616]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:06:28.776 --> 02:06:30.958]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:31.118 --> 02:06:32.579]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:06:32.599 --> 02:06:34.941]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:35.442 --> 02:06:37.103]  They are never going to stop.
[02:06:37.383 --> 02:06:41.267]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:44.630]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:45.010 --> 02:06:47.672]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:06:48.373 --> 02:06:49.113]  Imperative.
[02:06:49.374 --> 02:06:51.275]  Destroy 30-minute TV.
[02:06:51.335 --> 02:06:55.819]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:06:56.079 --> 02:06:57.441]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:06:57.481 --> 02:06:58.201]  You can feel it.
[02:07:01.255 --> 02:07:05.998]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[02:07:06.238 --> 02:07:09.320]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:07:09.581 --> 02:07:11.422]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:07:11.682 --> 02:07:13.623]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:07:13.844 --> 02:07:15.304]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:07:15.485 --> 02:07:18.547]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:07:18.827 --> 02:07:20.148]  If so, consider this.
[02:07:20.408 --> 02:07:29.314]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:07:29.674 --> 02:07:35.697]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[02:07:36.057 --> 02:07:37.697]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:38.098 --> 02:07:45.741]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[02:07:53.885 --> 02:07:54.266]  Live life healthy.
[02:07:54.286 --> 02:07:55.446]  I see the red moon rising
[02:08:11.073 --> 02:08:17.096]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:17.456 --> 02:08:23.940]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.884 --> 02:08:38.628]  Tomorrow, I'm going to be talking about ways to resist tyranny and the attempt to end the First Amendment in this country.
[02:08:39.804 --> 02:08:43.409]  With a special July 4th transmission in the first hour.
[02:08:44.670 --> 02:08:48.956]  I'm gonna tape a special report today about that for the first hour tomorrow.
[02:08:49.917 --> 02:08:54.142]  Then we'll be back Sunday with the Sunday live transmission 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:08:54.803 --> 02:08:56.185]  Central Standard Time.
[02:08:59.431 --> 02:09:02.453]  We've got a lot of breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:02.573 --> 02:09:05.355]  Family calls 911 if son threatens suicide.
[02:09:05.395 --> 02:09:06.636]  Cops show up and kill him.
[02:09:07.096 --> 02:09:10.318]  That is a more and more familiar thing that we see.
[02:09:11.379 --> 02:09:16.262]  Visiting websites about privacy gets you put on an NSA database of extremists.
[02:09:16.742 --> 02:09:18.363]  That's breaking at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:19.304 --> 02:09:34.330]  TSA plans enhanced security for 4th of July travelers worried about ISIS terrorists our government publicly created bipartisanly and gave missiles to and then armed to attack and destabilize the whole Middle East and cause a sectarian civil war.
[02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:37.931]  Because we have a government policy of destabilization.
[02:09:39.352 --> 02:09:48.335]  BBC reporter says Google moving to suppress legitimate journalism of sites like InfoWars.com impeach Obama protester charged for flying InfoWars
[02:09:50.071 --> 02:09:53.953]  Again, impeach Obama protester charged for flying Infowars Gadsden flag.
[02:09:54.293 --> 02:09:55.373]  Can't make that stuff up.
[02:09:56.074 --> 02:09:57.114]  That's in California.
[02:09:57.855 --> 02:10:02.617]  Independence Day, 79% of Americans are completely okay with the current level of tyranny.
[02:10:02.657 --> 02:10:03.757]  I don't believe that new poll.
[02:10:04.177 --> 02:10:05.178]  Neither does that writer.
[02:10:05.798 --> 02:10:08.800]  And then it gets into the fact that only 7% approve of Congress.
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:13.462]  The Bracks are morphing into an anti-dollar alliance.
[02:10:14.784 --> 02:10:19.025]  American sense of freedom plummets by another 12% since a poll last year.
[02:10:19.045 --> 02:10:24.607]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:26.927 --> 02:10:32.489]  Now, we are joined here until close to the end of the hour, then I'll go back to the callers that are holding.
[02:10:33.496 --> 02:10:42.904]  We are joined by Professor Darryl Hamamoto and he's a teacher and has taught at the University of California, Davis for most of his academic career.
[02:10:43.544 --> 02:10:49.649]  He holds an undergraduate and graduate degrees in political science, popular culture studies and comparative culture.
[02:10:49.989 --> 02:10:54.253]  Hamamoto is a senior ranking professor in the Department of Asian American Studies.
[02:10:54.853 --> 02:10:56.574]  He is a recognized authority in U.S.
[02:10:56.634 --> 02:10:56.874]  media.
[02:10:56.894 --> 02:10:58.275]  I've seen him on TV a lot of times.
[02:10:58.735 --> 02:11:02.457]  Popular culture and sexuality, having published extensively in these areas.
[02:11:02.477 --> 02:11:07.660]  Hamamoto is a recipient of the Rockefeller Foundation Research Fellowship, UCLA.
[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:09.141]  So he's a prestigious scholar.
[02:11:09.741 --> 02:11:11.602]  And a Fulbright Scholar, Japan.
[02:11:11.982 --> 02:11:16.745]  His current project is a volume that outlines the principles of New World Order theory.
[02:11:17.225 --> 02:11:20.947]  That's pretty revolutionary if you know what that means, because we live under a foundation,
[02:11:34.668 --> 02:11:36.169]  Roadmap of the Mind System.
[02:11:36.549 --> 02:11:38.311]  So he's a very interesting fellow.
[02:11:38.331 --> 02:11:52.001]  In fact, I was familiar with his work before we got in contact with him about some of his current papers that I know he's getting heat from at UC Davis dealing with all this where he currently resides and the headline from last week
[02:11:52.521 --> 02:11:54.944]  That Paul Watson wrote a story about.
[02:11:55.385 --> 02:11:59.731]  UC professor immigration influx is about re-education of society.
[02:12:00.152 --> 02:12:08.102]  Hamamoto warns amnesty will lead to creation of subservient underclass, which is just what Lord Monckton just said.
[02:12:08.956 --> 02:12:10.137]  Because that's what it is.
[02:12:10.297 --> 02:12:19.706]  But he's a real technical expert, not just a layman with my own street, you know, jive, you could say, definitions.
[02:12:19.987 --> 02:12:29.136]  He can give you the technical definitions via the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and he joins us right now from California.
[02:12:29.716 --> 02:12:31.318]  Thank you so much for coming on, Professor.
[02:12:32.338 --> 02:12:34.920]  Thank you, Alex, and welcome back from your vacation.
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:35.920]  Thank you, sir.
[02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:39.342]  Well, wow, I mean, in layman's terms, where does this all begin?
[02:12:41.483 --> 02:12:45.726]  Well, it begins in junior high school when I was voted class clown.
[02:12:46.626 --> 02:12:59.674]  And early on, I discovered that in my academic career, I discovered early on that I could either write an obscure article and publish it in an even more obscure academic journal that nobody reads,
[02:13:00.644 --> 02:13:04.065]  And the real important issues of our day will just go unnoticed.
[02:13:05.526 --> 02:13:13.628]  And I discovered that if I do a little bit of japery and parody that I'm getting far more attention with serious issues.
[02:13:14.609 --> 02:13:18.310]  And that's been my modus operandi ever since in the classroom.
[02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:21.011]  There's some of it in my scholarship as well.
[02:13:23.803 --> 02:13:30.088]  Get into what you mean by this foundation-driven cultural map.
[02:13:30.668 --> 02:13:32.309]  Let me give the exact quote here.
[02:13:32.729 --> 02:13:37.993]  In search of alternatives to the dominant foundation-guided corporatist curriculum.
[02:13:38.313 --> 02:13:39.955]  Because that's clearly what it is.
[02:13:39.975 --> 02:13:41.436]  A fake left, a fake right.
[02:13:42.036 --> 02:13:46.759]  And then you also talk about some of the new sub-cults that they're setting up, kind of race cults.
[02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:49.461]  Pretty frightening stuff by the establishment.
[02:13:50.642 --> 02:13:51.483]  Break it down for us.
[02:13:52.099 --> 02:13:56.522]  Yes, there's the race and the ethnicity cults, but importantly, I don't know if we're going to be able to get into this.
[02:13:56.562 --> 02:14:04.308]  There's also the GLBT agenda, which has absolutely nothing to do with GBL or T people.
[02:14:04.708 --> 02:14:11.233]  It's just a pretext in order to riot herd, so to speak, on the rest of the academic community.
[02:14:11.873 --> 02:14:26.574]  But going to your question, this really started to take in right after World War II, when the social scientists and behavioral scientists had compiled all this information they had gathered during World War II.
[02:14:27.495 --> 02:14:39.339]  And by the way, a lot of it was done on the backs of Asian Americans, like Japanese Americans in the concentration camps were studied by a large number of mostly anthropologists and social scientists.
[02:14:39.819 --> 02:14:51.243]  Anyway, all that information was compiled and passed on to the foundations and used as tools for social control, political manipulation.
[02:14:52.545 --> 02:14:57.069]  Mind control, you name it, the full spectrum, as you refer to it, of domination.
[02:14:57.550 --> 02:15:02.114]  So what we're coming back with in response is full spectrum opposition.
[02:15:03.772 --> 02:15:04.632]  Wow, very well said.
[02:15:04.652 --> 02:15:10.995]  In fact, I want to get you back on the whole fake gay agenda versus real freedom out there.
[02:15:11.055 --> 02:15:19.599]  And then also, I know you're an expert separately, and a lot of times they're on national news and quoted in newspapers about what happened to Japanese-Americans and others.
[02:15:19.919 --> 02:15:27.143]  People forget about that, that even in the Rand Corporation documents and others that I've seen, they admit that the years of captivity and slave labor
[02:15:27.663 --> 02:15:42.476]  of the super hard-working smart Japanese Americans, many of them fourth, fifth generation, who were scooped up and enslaved while their sons fought in Europe valiantly, has now become the model of how to round people up.
[02:15:42.516 --> 02:15:48.362]  In fact, how they're going to use city buses to come pick up the political dissidents this time, how they're going to control the cities.
[02:15:48.922 --> 02:15:50.804]  The Japanese in this country were the model of that.
[02:15:51.775 --> 02:16:00.221]  Yes, we were the beta test, and there's a direct historical connection between what you just described and the FEMA network today.
[02:16:00.641 --> 02:16:03.163]  It's not metaphorical, it's literal, it's political.
[02:16:03.183 --> 02:16:07.446]  The funding sources, the administrative level, it's very much consistent.
[02:16:07.866 --> 02:16:12.349]  And the bad news is that it's far, far more extensive than it was during World War II.
[02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:19.875]  And this time around, it's aimed directly at all Americans, regardless of your race, ethnicity, gender, and even social class.
[02:16:20.655 --> 02:16:25.997]  And that'll include even a lot of these professors who are smirking about some of these issues now.
[02:16:26.398 --> 02:16:30.239]  Maybe it'll take a few more to be beaten down in the street before they come to their senses.
[02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:32.320]  That's right.
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:36.442]  A lot of professors now are getting beat up for no reason on the street by the police.
[02:16:36.502 --> 02:16:37.143]  It's really good.
[02:16:38.123 --> 02:16:39.844]  It's a crazed system we're entering.
[02:16:40.644 --> 02:16:41.485]  Where do you want to begin?
[02:16:41.525 --> 02:16:45.646]  Because you're very eloquent and, again, understand the scientific technicals of this.
[02:16:46.147 --> 02:16:47.767]  You're pretty much trained in this system.
[02:16:50.319 --> 02:16:53.721]  Well, let's start on a positive note and then degenerate from there.
[02:16:54.441 --> 02:17:04.886]  Just recently, a team of researchers at the University of California Davis came out with a very important report in an academic journal, Environmental Health Perspectives.
[02:17:04.966 --> 02:17:17.511]  It's available online in PDF form, and it talks about the hazards of pesticides, especially the hazards to pregnant women and young children.
[02:17:17.652 --> 02:17:18.072]  Autism!
[02:17:18.972 --> 02:17:20.232]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:17:20.392 --> 02:17:24.273]  You speak of this all the time and many of your fine guests speak to this issue as well.
[02:17:24.533 --> 02:17:28.394]  So the University of California Davis does do some incredible research.
[02:17:28.414 --> 02:17:29.454]  That's one part of it.
[02:17:30.094 --> 02:17:33.715]  But in more recent times, they've gone over into the dark side.
[02:17:34.435 --> 02:17:46.977]  And it did not bode well for us when Big Sister Janet Dupalitano showed up as the president of the UC system directly after her reign at the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:17:47.737 --> 02:17:50.540]  This is the revelation of the method, so to speak.
[02:17:51.381 --> 02:18:05.138]  And I've also heard from colleagues and friends rumors that her real function in the sitting in the seat of the presidency of the University of California is to rule as a governor of FEMA region number 10.
[02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:07.561]  Unbelievable!
[02:18:08.775 --> 02:18:09.956]  Unbelievable but true.
[02:18:10.356 --> 02:18:13.097]  And this is what... That's a bombshell.
[02:18:13.117 --> 02:18:13.898]  Let's stop right there.
[02:18:13.958 --> 02:18:19.020]  Again, we have a prestigious top professor on right now, political science, you name it.
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:19.480]  It's true.
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:31.466]  I mean, mainstream media says you're... I mean, you are prestigious and prolific, saying you have sources in the university that are saying the word is, this is really her cover to be governor of FEMA Region 10.
[02:18:32.026 --> 02:18:34.267]  Obviously the plum of the West Coast.
[02:18:34.708 --> 02:18:35.428]  Oh my gosh.
[02:18:36.208 --> 02:18:37.529]  She is a regional governor.
[02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:39.791]  Tell us more about what you were told.
[02:18:39.811 --> 02:18:41.452]  She is a pro-consul.
[02:18:41.592 --> 02:18:42.172]  Absolutely.
[02:18:42.212 --> 02:18:43.773]  Well, she has no academic credentials.
[02:18:43.813 --> 02:18:44.434]  I believe she...
[02:18:45.436 --> 02:18:49.358]  That's a law degree from the University of Virginia, which is one of the better law schools.
[02:18:49.418 --> 02:18:55.542]  But she has no administrative or academic credentials that I'm aware of.
[02:18:57.343 --> 02:19:02.846]  So what else can we infer that she is here for nefarious purposes?
[02:19:04.527 --> 02:19:05.908]  This part is speculative.
[02:19:06.028 --> 02:19:10.071]  I'll preface whatever I'm saying that's speculative with this caveat.
[02:19:10.851 --> 02:19:18.397]  But the University of California has a pension fund that's worth about 41 to 45 billion dollars.
[02:19:18.457 --> 02:19:22.200]  That's just the UC system and public institutions across the country.
[02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:24.781]  I'm sure it's much, much more than that.
[02:19:25.322 --> 02:19:28.784]  Anyway, you can imagine that there are tons of
[02:19:30.319 --> 02:19:31.000]  I don't know.
[02:19:48.220 --> 02:19:50.040]  Are going to be very, very angry.
[02:19:50.461 --> 02:19:56.342]  And they have resources in order to combat, or to fight back, the theft of their pension.
[02:19:56.382 --> 02:19:59.042]  And you speak to this issue quite often.
[02:19:59.062 --> 02:20:01.223]  I think this is the next plumb.
[02:20:01.243 --> 02:20:05.444]  Oh yeah, they're getting UT ready to take their pensions as well.
[02:20:05.504 --> 02:20:11.005]  So all these people that have gone along with this, they're going to be the last to get their throats slit.
[02:20:12.253 --> 02:20:13.613]  That's exactly it.
[02:20:14.013 --> 02:20:16.954]  We're verging on the night of the long knives.
[02:20:17.074 --> 02:20:21.976]  By the way, the predecessor to Janet Napolitano is a guy named Mark Yudof.
[02:20:22.816 --> 02:20:25.917]  Just prior to coming to the University of California as president, guess what?
[02:20:25.977 --> 02:20:27.877]  He was president of the University of Texas.
[02:20:28.977 --> 02:20:36.779]  So these people rotate in and out, and after they've done their job, they kind of slink away and they probably get jobs at the Ford Foundation.
[02:20:37.159 --> 02:20:39.080]  Again, it's the foundations again, which are
[02:20:39.740 --> 02:20:52.191]  Yeah, let's start from the top because you're an expert in this and one of their scholars and so let's, we should get Francis Boyle back on too.
[02:20:52.432 --> 02:21:03.682]  He actually went through their secret Henry Kissinger training level for global governance and then exposed them from the inside at Harvard and then the same thing with some of the other people we've had on from the actual meetings where you're actually
[02:21:04.102 --> 02:21:05.143]  You know, given this intel.
[02:21:05.984 --> 02:21:11.748]  So, break down maybe from the top of the foundation pyramid for us, and then tie it into the social engineering.
[02:21:12.209 --> 02:21:15.331]  Before I go on, Francis Boyle is a really good example.
[02:21:15.371 --> 02:21:20.315]  This is directed to my colleagues in the higher education field, my fellow professors.
[02:21:20.615 --> 02:21:32.004]  Francis Boyle is a great example of someone who was tempted by the system, who was tapped, and was slated to become one of these functionaries, these pro-councils for the foundations.
[02:21:32.785 --> 02:21:33.885]  But he refused that.
[02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:37.827]  Instead, he decided to pursue the moral and ethical course.
[02:21:38.927 --> 02:21:55.572]  By the way, you're talking about an imperial legate, for those that don't know in history, who literally speak as the mouth of the system, who are really viceroys or governors, and that's actually what Henry Kissinger and others have called themselves, Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[02:21:56.212 --> 02:21:59.034]  And he was tapped for that and basically turned it down.
[02:21:59.474 --> 02:22:03.716]  Obviously, Janet Napolitano and others didn't, and that's how this system really works.
[02:22:04.016 --> 02:22:07.498]  And that's why the political class goes along with it, because they want to be governors.
[02:22:07.518 --> 02:22:11.500]  They want to be sub-governors of this new global system.
[02:22:11.981 --> 02:22:14.142]  But if we expose it, it's over for them.
[02:22:14.802 --> 02:22:17.783]  It is, and you know what, this process begins at the undergraduate level.
[02:22:17.863 --> 02:22:20.583]  It begins at the elite institutions of higher education.
[02:22:21.343 --> 02:22:30.105]  And what I've been discovering recently, this is bombshell information as well, this is being coordinated by so-called student services.
[02:22:30.565 --> 02:22:41.987]  There's been an incredible infusion of funding and hiring of these weasels who are catering to students in the guise of student activism.
[02:22:42.247 --> 02:22:42.607]  Unbelievable!
[02:23:11.716 --> 02:23:20.499]  Are aware of this new world order curriculum, the theory and practice, and this is not being addressed in academia at this point.
[02:23:20.539 --> 02:23:29.222]  It is my purpose, my single singular purpose, professional purpose to bring this into the standard curriculum.
[02:23:29.262 --> 02:23:30.203]  So it almost becomes a.
[02:23:32.007 --> 02:23:38.614]  It's going to be so and I believe this can happen because this is a really, really receptive generation.
[02:23:39.015 --> 02:23:40.276]  We're scratching their heads.
[02:23:40.756 --> 02:23:52.428]  They're learning obsolete forms of knowledge, information, so-called theory with a capital T, which also came out of the foundations that came out of institutions like Yale.
[02:23:53.229 --> 02:23:55.810]  This is why people are fleeing from the humanities.
[02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:59.571]  Because there is absolutely no relevance to their lives.
[02:23:59.591 --> 02:24:01.832]  They don't even read fiction or literature.
[02:24:01.872 --> 02:24:06.914]  They read theory about literature and short stories and poetry.
[02:24:07.913 --> 02:24:08.574]  Well, that's right.
[02:24:08.594 --> 02:24:09.895]  I think that's intentional, by the way.
[02:24:10.256 --> 02:24:11.037]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:24:11.057 --> 02:24:24.251]  And the big foundations, as you know, admit that they have to take the true critical thinking out, the love of history, the love of the humanities, and make it synthetic and fake so that basically those systems die.
[02:24:24.471 --> 02:24:28.215]  Just like they infiltrated the media and the press, bought it off to destroy it.
[02:24:29.056 --> 02:24:32.817]  To just get rid of it and now literally have robots that just write press releases.
[02:24:33.378 --> 02:24:34.438]  That's the program.
[02:24:34.798 --> 02:24:35.618]  That's the plan.
[02:24:35.698 --> 02:24:44.902]  Give people obsolete degrees so they can implode the colleges after they've helped sell the people out and just create corporate technical schools.
[02:24:46.142 --> 02:24:53.607]  That literally just create technicians, very small groups of managers to then manage the system.
[02:24:53.627 --> 02:24:57.749]  This is the destruction of the Renaissance, the destruction of the love of art.
[02:24:58.250 --> 02:25:09.697]  This is the evisceration of people being complex lovers of knowledge, because a complex lover of knowledge is going to recognize the tyranny and is not going to go along with it.
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:11.420]  That's exactly right.
[02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:15.602]  These are the specialists that you refer to as the technocracy.
[02:25:15.622 --> 02:25:19.123]  A lot of them at this point are coming from Asia.
[02:25:19.163 --> 02:25:24.345]  They have absolutely no knowledge, historical awareness of this process.
[02:25:24.365 --> 02:25:26.386]  This is part of my job to educate them.
[02:25:27.266 --> 02:25:36.593]  Currently, they're bringing in large numbers of people from mainland China at the undergraduate level, and they're paying premium fees.
[02:25:38.354 --> 02:25:46.260]  I had one student who finished two years at UC Davis from Vietnam, and it's not a wealthy country.
[02:25:46.921 --> 02:25:53.746]  Yet, over two years, her family spent $200,000 in order to send her to the University of California.
[02:25:55.432 --> 02:25:55.693]  Wow.
[02:25:56.233 --> 02:26:07.743]  Yeah, and at the same time, as we've been noting over the last few days, the larger master plan, they have a name for it, it's called the 2020 Initiative.
[02:26:07.883 --> 02:26:08.103]  Yes.
[02:26:08.124 --> 02:26:09.385]  This is at UC Davis.
[02:26:10.586 --> 02:26:17.452]  And the plan there is to bring large numbers of illegal aliens who are now teenagers, but in a few years will be undergraduates.
[02:26:18.446 --> 02:26:38.932]  Barely literate, unschooled in American political culture and our rich heritage of freedom, democracy, individual liberty, and constitutional guarantees, who will be the next generation of CPS workers and emissaries for the larger welfare state?
[02:26:40.197 --> 02:27:00.521]  Unbelievable, and I forget his name, we had him on about two years ago, but even liberal, real liberal members of the Labor Party and others have come on the show and admitted, no, we brought immigrants in over the last twenty years from the former Soviet Union, and they've made them the police and the CPS workers, and they're now just disappearing kids.
[02:27:00.862 --> 02:27:07.183]  They will do whatever they're told, and a lot of them were brought in as teenagers, and it turns out the model they pulled in England
[02:27:07.623 --> 02:27:11.906]  And the UK, I'm getting chills right now, literally folks, is now the model here.
[02:27:12.187 --> 02:27:13.868]  This is so creepy.
[02:27:14.148 --> 02:27:21.033]  This is the domestic national security force just as big, just as strong as our military that they're bringing in.
[02:27:21.513 --> 02:27:23.615]  And again, I have nothing against these young poor kids.
[02:27:23.655 --> 02:27:28.198]  What are they going to think being brought in at 15, 14, the government gives them everything
[02:27:29.019 --> 02:27:37.646]  Just like the old Soviet Union used to take the orphans and make them be the tax police, this is literally an authoritarian model that comes right out of the old Soviet Union.
[02:27:38.107 --> 02:27:39.448]  Or right out of Nazi Germany.
[02:27:39.828 --> 02:27:40.489]  Hitler Youth.
[02:27:40.569 --> 02:27:41.590]  I mean, this is not a joke.
[02:27:42.293 --> 02:27:44.354]  It's being rolled out right as we speak.
[02:27:44.554 --> 02:27:54.680]  There's another dimension of this as well with the large numbers of younger undergraduates that are being cultivated for this larger welfare state system.
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:57.221]  And that is ROTC.
[02:27:57.922 --> 02:28:02.804]  I have a lot of students who can't make it financially and through the undergraduate
[02:28:05.786 --> 02:28:12.330]  So they have to sign up for ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps, in order to pay for their tuition and the books.
[02:28:12.850 --> 02:28:27.600]  So, as you know, ROTC at these public institutions are being trained to see the American public, the so-called civilians, as the enemy, as the major threat.
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:29.541]  So you have that dimension as well.
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:33.540]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:34.941]  This is the Department of Defense.
[02:28:35.421 --> 02:28:35.661]  Wow.
[02:28:36.421 --> 02:28:36.901]  Absolutely.
[02:28:36.941 --> 02:28:44.743]  In fact, while you were saying that, I was on the button off-air saying, pull up the New York Times about the preparations for civil collapse, just to back up everything you're saying.
[02:28:44.783 --> 02:28:45.443]  Please continue.
[02:28:45.483 --> 02:28:46.303]  Certainly, yeah.
[02:28:47.383 --> 02:28:59.226]  And a lot of the young people are used to the El Jefe system of governance, as opposed to the Republican forms with a small r. They're not used to our political culture, and they'll
[02:29:00.504 --> 02:29:05.308]  You know, I think do about anything in order to get over in society.
[02:29:07.890 --> 02:29:12.814]  However, this is not unique to immigrant students as well.
[02:29:13.875 --> 02:29:20.481]  People of four or five generations have almost completely lost touch with our political traditions.
[02:29:21.282 --> 02:29:23.604]  Well, I was about to say, as bad as some of these
[02:29:25.057 --> 02:29:36.106]  Drugs that they're bringing in on purpose so they can be malleable are, compared to a lot of slovenly Americans, I don't care what color they are, it's already so bad, it's insane.
[02:29:36.687 --> 02:29:43.052]  And I want to come back and talk as a political scientist, where you think this is going, Professor, and ways to stop it.
[02:29:43.632 --> 02:29:46.195]  Because they're going to exploit these people like nobody else.
[02:29:47.075 --> 02:29:48.316]  How do you reach out to them?
[02:29:48.576 --> 02:29:50.118]  How are you being successful doing that?
[02:29:51.421 --> 02:29:54.269]  And are you being persecuted for it?
[02:29:54.570 --> 02:29:55.292]  We're gonna ask him that.
[02:30:02.338 --> 02:30:06.340]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:10.563]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:30:10.743 --> 02:30:14.185]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:30:14.405 --> 02:30:17.287]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:30:17.447 --> 02:30:24.812]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:30:25.032 --> 02:30:28.654]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:30:28.934 --> 02:30:33.175]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:30:33.336 --> 02:30:39.278]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:30:39.318 --> 02:30:43.099]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:30:43.259 --> 02:30:45.780]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:30:45.980 --> 02:30:47.340]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:30:47.480 --> 02:30:48.721]  It's time to take action.
[02:30:48.861 --> 02:30:50.561]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:31:02.505 --> 02:31:09.566]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:09.666 --> 02:31:11.827]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:12.007 --> 02:31:17.108]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:17.288 --> 02:31:22.229]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:25.510]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:25.770 --> 02:31:29.631]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:29.851 --> 02:31:34.092]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:34.172 --> 02:31:44.195]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:44.415 --> 02:31:46.916]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:31:47.116 --> 02:31:55.180]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:59.302]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:02.558 --> 02:32:08.505]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:32:08.725 --> 02:32:12.929]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:17.855]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:32:18.255 --> 02:32:20.857]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:32:21.177 --> 02:32:26.360]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:32:26.621 --> 02:32:33.505]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:32:34.005 --> 02:32:37.728]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:32:38.148 --> 02:32:42.931]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:43.271 --> 02:32:44.112]  This is innovating.
[02:32:44.392 --> 02:32:51.698]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:32:51.858 --> 02:32:55.941]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:33:19.645 --> 02:33:25.769]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:26.170 --> 02:33:27.691]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.872 --> 02:33:33.174]  I want to be complex here.
[02:33:34.876 --> 02:33:41.480]  And if you listen to this radio show versus others, we bring in a lot of issues, a lot of names, a lot of terms you'll never hear anywhere.
[02:33:42.361 --> 02:33:45.083]  But you see more of those like technocracy,
[02:33:47.609 --> 02:33:53.173]  Being brought into the common language as people discover what's going on.
[02:33:53.654 --> 02:33:56.396]  And the establishment, in so many publications, it makes my head spin.
[02:33:56.416 --> 02:33:57.476]  We've quoted a lot of them here.
[02:33:57.897 --> 02:34:07.344]  Admits that's their plan, to dumb things down to where the public are like sheep and can't revolt against the practice of eating mutton.
[02:34:08.291 --> 02:34:24.586]  To quote Bertrand Russell, who is hailed as this incredible liberal, and who they write all these books about and who won a Nobel Prize, but then you really read his writings that were technical, not best-selling books, and the guy's an absolute monster, who wanted nuclear war to reduce world population and stuff.
[02:34:24.646 --> 02:34:26.508]  I mean, it's like, whoa!
[02:34:26.528 --> 02:34:27.990]  Whoa!
[02:34:28.050 --> 02:34:29.291]  These people are as bad as Hitler.
[02:34:30.874 --> 02:34:39.381]  And it's this elite attitude of the public or scum and then a self-fulfilling prophecy to dumb us down so that they can make us the ignorant slaves they want.
[02:34:40.222 --> 02:34:42.284]  We are going to become gods.
[02:34:43.825 --> 02:34:44.265]  Period.
[02:34:44.285 --> 02:34:46.447]  If you don't like it, get off.
[02:34:47.748 --> 02:34:48.889]  You don't have to contribute.
[02:34:49.169 --> 02:34:50.510]  You don't have to participate.
[02:34:51.471 --> 02:34:55.835]  But if you're going to interfere with me becoming god,
[02:34:57.631 --> 02:34:58.633]  I'm gonna have big trouble.
[02:35:12.128 --> 02:35:16.232]  All new tech on record has tracker systems to watch and control everything you do.
[02:35:16.612 --> 02:35:22.538]  The light bulbs that have been out for five years are designed so they can send data down power line to track everything you're doing.
[02:35:23.058 --> 02:35:30.205]  It's in the New York Times two years ago, but then MSNBC attacks me and says I'm insane because I believe the dishwasher is watching you.
[02:35:30.445 --> 02:35:31.306]  No, I didn't say that.
[02:35:31.366 --> 02:35:33.708]  Petraeus said that in Wired Magazine.
[02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:39.052]  Yes, I talked about it a decade before it was in the news, because it was in the MIT quarterly.
[02:35:39.373 --> 02:35:41.554]  It was in the Stanford Research Institute.
[02:35:41.774 --> 02:35:46.858]  See, that's what's so frustrating here, is that 98% of this is public.
[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:54.083]  And then we're here trying to get people to understand it, and they go, oh, I don't want to hear that, that's scary.
[02:35:54.103 --> 02:35:56.605]  But the good news is, this has progressed so far,
[02:35:58.971 --> 02:36:05.684]  That people realize that it's authoritarian and totalitarian and so they're starting to say no to it.
[02:36:05.724 --> 02:36:10.933]  They're starting to realize that it's out of control and it's a giant quasi secretive program.
[02:36:12.264 --> 02:36:16.869]  With a bunch of control freaks who say, we're allowed to do what we want and build our world.
[02:36:17.229 --> 02:36:18.531]  You better get out of our way.
[02:36:18.551 --> 02:36:23.356]  And then it's a fundamentally anti-human world for a tiny elite.
[02:36:23.777 --> 02:36:29.022]  I don't know how they think they're going to ever get all these benefits out of this horrible slave system they're building.
[02:36:29.363 --> 02:36:33.047]  I look at how they try to implode Latin America and Africa to control them.
[02:36:34.127 --> 02:36:34.848]  I see all this.
[02:36:35.008 --> 02:36:36.609]  I want to empower Latin America.
[02:36:37.050 --> 02:36:46.258]  And then Nancy Pelosi says, you're racist if you don't totally open the border, pay for all these people to come in, who will on record become a permanent under political class.
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:52.784]  And then even people with PhDs can't understand this when it's so simple.
[02:36:53.124 --> 02:36:55.827]  How am I going to get somebody I can't even talk to?
[02:36:57.048 --> 02:36:58.749]  Because I don't speak Spanish well.
[02:36:59.230 --> 02:37:00.431]  How am I going to wake them up?
[02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:03.291]  I mean, it's game over, folks.
[02:37:03.811 --> 02:37:04.471]  It's game over.
[02:37:04.812 --> 02:37:07.913]  And so I'm going to try to shut up, because he's being polite and letting me talk, but I'll go on forever.
[02:37:08.193 --> 02:37:15.457]  Professor Daryl Hamamoto from the university, joining us, ucdavis.edu, you can find his page there.
[02:37:15.878 --> 02:37:17.459]  I mean, you've got the floor for the rest of this segment.
[02:37:17.479 --> 02:37:18.279]  I'm going to try to shut up here.
[02:37:18.679 --> 02:37:19.320]  Go through!
[02:37:21.241 --> 02:37:22.683]  Because as a layman, I see what they do.
[02:37:22.723 --> 02:37:30.310]  They take everybody's basic rights, black, white, asian, hispanic, most kids I see are quote, mixed, so the future of that won't even matter.
[02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:41.661]  The system injecting race, sex issues, region issues, anti-male, female issues, because they give you the fake right of not trusting each other, and the systems, the arbiter, and the referee
[02:37:43.863 --> 02:37:46.724]  And then, oh, we're going to, you know, hype up, we'll pay for your sex change.
[02:37:46.744 --> 02:37:58.169]  We're going to hype up that you can have a Hispanic America, and we'll show the gringo, and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and then the Ford Foundation's funding it, and liberation theology.
[02:37:58.209 --> 02:38:01.550]  And then, how do you communicate to people about that?
[02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:04.251]  How do you show them that it's Balkanization?
[02:38:04.851 --> 02:38:08.413]  Break it down for folks out there from your research and being an insider.
[02:38:09.073 --> 02:38:10.314]  What's currently happening?
[02:38:10.694 --> 02:38:14.355]  What's going on in the model area, California, for this system?
[02:38:15.575 --> 02:38:23.238]  Well, what's happened is that what originally started as a very useful and valuable critique, a way of understanding U.S.
[02:38:23.278 --> 02:38:38.304]  national history from the perspective of immigration, race, ethnicity, gender, has become hijacked, courtesy of the foundations against that started to subsidize it and weaponize these forms of information.
[02:38:38.624 --> 02:38:44.029]  So now what was once liberatory sources of knowledge have become oppressive.
[02:38:44.069 --> 02:38:52.477]  And this is what your younger generation of potentially educated middle class people are being subjected to.
[02:38:52.817 --> 02:38:54.619]  So I want to shatter that paradigm.
[02:38:54.639 --> 02:38:56.681]  I want to introduce other perspectives.
[02:38:56.801 --> 02:39:00.825]  I call it, for the sake of convenience, New World Order Theory.
[02:39:01.025 --> 02:39:02.486]  That's my objective.
[02:39:02.506 --> 02:39:03.928]  And I've been already introducing this.
[02:39:04.948 --> 02:39:19.236]  Into the classroom, and this is where I've been running afoul of the administration and my department in specific, because they're locked into a 30 or 40 year old model based on race, ethnicity, and gender.
[02:39:19.316 --> 02:39:20.637]  It no longer obtains.
[02:39:20.697 --> 02:39:31.023]  It has zero practical or even empirical relevance to what's going on in the world now, which seems to be going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:39:32.526 --> 02:39:38.310]  So, yeah, it's information and education that will win the day.
[02:39:39.251 --> 02:40:00.285]  Now, one secret weapon, so to speak, that these small stratum of power freaks have not really anticipated is that historically, this is not just in the United States, but globally, historically, there's never been a larger educated middle class.
[02:40:00.325 --> 02:40:02.046]  These are people who have been to university.
[02:40:03.067 --> 02:40:04.908]  People who have college education.
[02:40:04.928 --> 02:40:19.782]  And it's these people that I'm focusing on who only need to be pricked slightly for all these other connections and synapses to fire who will be won over to this new level of understanding.
[02:40:19.842 --> 02:40:22.485]  And this is happening constantly.
[02:40:22.585 --> 02:40:23.325]  It's multiplying.
[02:40:23.365 --> 02:40:27.009]  It's metastasizing, if you will, in a good way.
[02:40:27.769 --> 02:40:29.410]  Thanks to programs such as yours.
[02:40:29.490 --> 02:40:32.431]  It's going to happen in the university as well, I'm convinced of it.
[02:40:32.952 --> 02:40:38.034]  But in order for that to take place, some of us will have to take risks.
[02:40:38.894 --> 02:40:41.075]  Some of us will have to put our careers on the line.
[02:40:42.356 --> 02:40:44.797]  Some of us will have to get used to being mocked.
[02:40:44.817 --> 02:40:48.359]  It doesn't bother me, as I told you, I've always been the class clown.
[02:40:49.719 --> 02:40:54.501]  One of my favorite intellectual heroes is the great Irish-American comedian George Carlin.
[02:40:54.761 --> 02:40:55.082]  Oh yeah!
[02:40:56.460 --> 02:41:03.405]  I quote him all the time in class and he understands the profound duality of humanity.
[02:41:03.525 --> 02:41:07.048]  One of his great collections is called Napalm and Silly Putty.
[02:41:08.229 --> 02:41:12.251]  Both Napalm and Silly Putty came out of the same human consciousness.
[02:41:12.492 --> 02:41:13.733]  It's that crazy.
[02:41:13.773 --> 02:41:19.437]  So I want to move it more in the direction of the Silly Putty and move away from the destructive technologies.
[02:41:20.484 --> 02:41:27.049]  And as I lecture in class, I have a lot of students who are into sciences, expectant scientists and engineers.
[02:41:27.249 --> 02:41:44.580]  I'm telling them that the situation is so out of whack that you have careers guaranteed for you to undo the damage that has been wrought by these power freaks to our environment, to our bodies, to our psyches.
[02:41:45.761 --> 02:41:46.822]  Dehumanizing us.
[02:41:47.302 --> 02:42:05.771]  You will have a guaranteed career if you understand their system and create counter technologies, counter literature, oppositional forms of expression that you can cultivate at the university using their extensive resources and we can retake the American Republic.
[02:42:05.871 --> 02:42:06.912]  We can regenerate
[02:42:07.712 --> 02:42:13.075]  This, uh, necrotic death culture that has been foisted upon us by MTV.
[02:42:13.515 --> 02:42:15.696]  By the way, uh, you might not be aware of this.
[02:42:15.796 --> 02:42:19.398]  I researched this because I've been, uh, mobbed by these media.
[02:42:20.118 --> 02:42:22.920]  Uh, there's a site called Rate My Professors.
[02:42:24.113 --> 02:42:26.014]  And I score very low on that, I think.
[02:42:26.875 --> 02:42:28.115]  And I checked into it.
[02:42:28.155 --> 02:42:29.376]  It's owned by MTV.
[02:42:30.056 --> 02:42:36.640]  It's an entertainment vehicle that's being used in order to stigmatize me.
[02:42:36.820 --> 02:42:39.121]  But it's not going to happen.
[02:42:39.141 --> 02:42:50.947]  The Chancellor Katehi, the mad gasser, and I was there on that fateful Friday day when she called out the police to gas people expressing their
[02:42:53.362 --> 02:42:56.033]  Their opposition to the direction of the university.
[02:42:57.154 --> 02:42:59.855]  The Mad Gasser, Linda Katehi, by the way, she's foreign-born.
[02:42:59.895 --> 02:43:12.779]  One of the strategies for the globalists is to put foreign-born people from anti-democratic societies like Greece into these top-level positions, such as Chancellor of the University of California, Davis, because they're globalists.
[02:43:12.799 --> 02:43:16.980]  They're fascists, they're totalitarians, they're authoritarians at minimum.
[02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:22.742]  Anyway, Linda Katehi earlier this year sent me an extensive memorandum
[02:43:23.582 --> 02:43:28.985]  Saying that she's going to put me on 25% salary reduction for six months.
[02:43:29.606 --> 02:43:42.013]  So, and I say this because a lot of people assume that so-called tenure is absolute, but there's many different ways to get you and one of them is death by a thousand cuts.
[02:43:43.061 --> 02:43:45.786]  So I'm going to contest it.
[02:43:45.906 --> 02:43:54.100]  And by the way, if there are any labor attorneys out there, people who are interested in making legal history.
[02:43:54.969 --> 02:44:01.054]  Because University of California is also the site where the Bakke versus the U.C.
[02:44:01.134 --> 02:44:04.016]  Board of Regents was argued in front of the Supreme Court.
[02:44:04.056 --> 02:44:10.862]  This could be bigger than Bakke because we are going to raise issues that go far beyond that of affirmative action.
[02:44:10.882 --> 02:44:15.926]  We're going to go into the nature of the American Republic itself and the role of the University of California.
[02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:19.952]  California and destroying the American Republic.
[02:44:20.032 --> 02:44:40.205]  Professor Daryl Hamamoto is our guest and he's a well-known political scientist and more cultural analyst and he's won major awards for his research and he basically has been going more and more public about what's really going on and telling the young people the young adults there
[02:44:41.491 --> 02:44:42.613]  About the man behind the curtain.
[02:44:43.414 --> 02:44:44.916]  And it's making him very unhappy.
[02:44:44.936 --> 02:44:46.879]  So they're like, hey, we're going to cut your money, buddy.
[02:44:46.899 --> 02:44:47.961]  We're going to turn your lights off.
[02:44:48.441 --> 02:44:49.403]  Better do what you're told.
[02:44:50.264 --> 02:44:52.307]  And he is now going the opposite direction.
[02:44:52.367 --> 02:44:53.088]  He's not a coward.
[02:44:54.014 --> 02:44:58.196]  And what he's exposing here is that it isn't left and right going on at the universities.
[02:44:59.036 --> 02:45:10.101]  It is an authoritarianism that calls itself the left, calls itself the right on the universities, calls itself the left mainly, that is incredibly oppressive and everyone should stand with him.
[02:45:10.501 --> 02:45:15.643]  And even if they end up running him out of there down the road, he'll have a best-selling book in it and will become a dissonant professor.
[02:45:15.883 --> 02:45:17.464]  But this is what freedom is all about.
[02:45:17.804 --> 02:45:20.225]  This is what the animating struggle is all about.
[02:45:20.945 --> 02:45:26.249]  And it's rewarding to do the right thing, and even if doors close, bigger doors, in my experience, will open.
[02:45:26.589 --> 02:45:36.776]  Or, if people don't come to his aid and others' aid, the great corruption, the great stagnation, what we already see spreading like a disease, will intensify.
[02:45:36.896 --> 02:45:46.423]  And you were speaking about how just knowing the knowledge I know from 20 years of this, in business, and I've done some in business on the side,
[02:45:47.597 --> 02:45:49.458]  You name it, just incredible success.
[02:45:49.518 --> 02:45:52.799]  I mean, off record, it's been off record, I made a big deal about it.
[02:45:53.219 --> 02:46:01.142]  I've consulted for some major corporations just to see what it would be like over the years, and even some major production firms.
[02:46:01.182 --> 02:46:03.463]  I mean, I've been in a movie produced by George Clooney.
[02:46:03.483 --> 02:46:09.925]  I was a major consultant on that about future tyrannies to upgrade Philip K. Dick's film Scanner Darkly.
[02:46:09.945 --> 02:46:12.646]  But I'm not going to get into a lot of it because I've signed non-disclosures.
[02:46:13.306 --> 02:46:23.370]  At the level I'm at, even the establishment, not as a payoff, but wants to come and see what's your view on this, for a perspective, because their own minions are so compartmentalized, they don't get it.
[02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:33.473]  See, only a very small group of less than 6,000, the Kissinger group, and I agree with it, 6,000 technocrats, that's even low, mid, and high level running.
[02:46:33.833 --> 02:46:35.114]  Only a few hundred at the top.
[02:46:36.047 --> 02:46:45.952]  And so they don't want this knowledge known, and what the professors reverse engineering, and what I've reverse engineered from my perspective, doesn't mean I have all the answers, will bring them down.
[02:46:46.492 --> 02:46:51.235]  But separately, it can take the educations you've got that are only one spectrum,
[02:46:51.795 --> 02:46:58.297]  You expand and basically square that spectrum and then actually you're honest with yourself about how the real systems work.
[02:46:58.577 --> 02:47:03.079]  Start reading elite publications where they're trying to get their own technicians to understand how it works.
[02:47:03.479 --> 02:47:05.939]  It is the most valuable education you can get.
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:13.522]  And the minute people understand there's real knowledge they've told you doesn't exist that exists right behind the curtain.
[02:47:14.426 --> 02:47:27.272]  In all the books they've written, all their admissions, you will then have the fire politically, economically, socially, culturally of Prometheus that they're claiming they're selling real liberalism.
[02:47:27.852 --> 02:47:29.093]  They're the opposite, folks.
[02:47:29.413 --> 02:47:31.614]  Thomas Jefferson's a liberal, as I say every day.
[02:47:32.354 --> 02:47:33.355]  Big Sis is not.
[02:47:33.755 --> 02:47:35.456]  This professor I would call a real liberal.
[02:47:36.366 --> 02:47:38.407]  Okay, Barack Obama is not.
[02:47:38.987 --> 02:47:40.967]  Boehner calls himself a conservative.
[02:47:40.987 --> 02:47:41.968]  The guy's a monster.
[02:47:42.548 --> 02:47:43.328]  He's a betrayer.
[02:47:43.568 --> 02:47:50.030]  I'm sorry I'm ranting here, Professor, but what you said is why they're after you, because people know they're going into dead ends.
[02:47:51.010 --> 02:47:53.271]  We show them, hey, we're not making the maps of the mind.
[02:47:53.731 --> 02:47:54.591]  There are no maps.
[02:47:54.891 --> 02:47:56.072]  Experience it for yourself.
[02:47:56.512 --> 02:47:57.532]  It's over for them.
[02:47:57.912 --> 02:48:04.494]  The real renaissance, as you said, with this middle class that's left, could be the detonation center for worldwide liberty to the stars.
[02:48:06.139 --> 02:48:07.140]  And that's what I want to see.
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:15.087]  I want, a hundred years from now, for our children and great-grandchildren and progeny to be doing incredible things of their own free will.
[02:48:15.627 --> 02:48:21.913]  And that's what I desire, and that's why I hate these technocrats so much, because they would shutter the mind.
[02:48:21.953 --> 02:48:23.154]  They would shutter perception.
[02:48:23.415 --> 02:48:26.357]  They would shutter our potential so they could rule us?
[02:48:26.858 --> 02:48:29.040]  I mean, these people are disgusting!
[02:48:30.404 --> 02:48:31.965]  They're absolutely disgusting.
[02:48:32.005 --> 02:48:44.949]  And in my classes, I tell my students, I said, I am here not just to instruct you, but I'm here to honor your parents who sacrificed so much in order that you fill this seat here at this esteemed university.
[02:48:45.249 --> 02:48:50.631]  It's an homage to their struggles as immigrants, as refugees, as fifth or sixth generation Americans.
[02:48:50.971 --> 02:48:57.754]  And there's a third constituency besides you that's sitting in this classroom, and that is your progeny, your unborn children.
[02:48:58.154 --> 02:49:03.058]  Who will benefit from your learning acquired at this institution?
[02:49:03.218 --> 02:49:04.780]  So I have three constituencies.
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:12.647]  And by the way, in Japanese language, there's a character, it's sensei, and in Chinese, it's shifu.
[02:49:12.867 --> 02:49:17.531]  But it means there's a notion of generativity and that which comes before.
[02:49:17.911 --> 02:49:21.294]  So there's that interlocking generativity and
[02:49:23.556 --> 02:49:42.263]  That connection with future generations that you speak of often that I am trying to communicate to the classroom and to the students in the classroom and in that way they can connect what they're learning from what's before them with the future as well as with the past.
[02:49:42.483 --> 02:49:44.524]  That's one of my main pedagogical strategies.
[02:49:45.164 --> 02:49:49.486]  Well they're obviously scared of what you're doing and as you said once the genie is out of the bottle
[02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:52.951]  The genie is out of the bottle.
[02:49:52.991 --> 02:49:54.832]  It's not going back.
[02:49:55.032 --> 02:49:57.114]  You can't un-hear information.
[02:49:57.154 --> 02:49:58.315]  You can't un-hear the truth.
[02:49:58.355 --> 02:50:00.376]  You can't un-learn it.
[02:50:01.357 --> 02:50:04.599]  If they get rid of me, more people are going to be rolling forward.
[02:50:04.979 --> 02:50:09.382]  And I think my appearance here is going to embolden a lot of my colleagues to step forward.
[02:50:09.682 --> 02:50:10.743]  Most of them are scared.
[02:50:10.763 --> 02:50:11.703]  Most of them are frightened.
[02:50:11.743 --> 02:50:17.307]  Most of them want to retire on a pension that won't be there when it's time for them to go.
[02:50:17.327 --> 02:50:21.410]  We either fight now, stand up now, or we're going to lose everything.
[02:50:21.890 --> 02:50:27.992]  We fight now, but we've drawn a line in the sand, and it's do or die right here and now.
[02:50:28.793 --> 02:50:47.799]  Wow, I want to come back in the final segment here, Professor, and I want to invite you back soon to get into the specifics of the immigrant programming, the LBJ, you know, all that programming that's going on, and just look at every little angle of this from a different perspective, so we can hopefully get people thinking for themselves.
[02:50:47.819 --> 02:50:49.420]  I'll do a little bit of overdrive to go to Matt.
[02:50:50.223 --> 02:50:53.084]  Uh, and George and Nathan and folks that have been holding.
[02:50:53.624 --> 02:50:58.686]  Uh, but our guest, Professor Daryl Hamamoto, uh, joins us right now.
[02:50:58.746 --> 02:51:02.027]  He is already being persecuted at UC Davis by the thought police.
[02:51:02.248 --> 02:51:04.889]  Hey, this is Steve Sanchez worried about the Wall Street casino.
[02:51:04.969 --> 02:51:05.549]  Yeah, me too.
[02:51:05.689 --> 02:51:07.790]  Wondering when the stock market is going to collapse.
[02:51:07.930 --> 02:51:10.911]  You probably want answers, but you know, you can't trust the global elite.
[02:51:10.971 --> 02:51:16.233]  Well, my good friend, Brett kitchen bestselling author has created a DVD set called the millionaire black box.
[02:51:16.313 --> 02:51:19.014]  And for a limited time, you get free access call one 800.
[02:51:19.574 --> 02:51:19.995]  We're good.
[02:51:32.435 --> 02:51:33.215]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:51:33.235 --> 02:51:34.736]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:35.036 --> 02:51:36.337]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:36.697 --> 02:51:39.038]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:39.518 --> 02:51:41.359]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:41.799 --> 02:51:45.861]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:51:46.321 --> 02:51:50.023]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:51:50.263 --> 02:51:53.705]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:51:54.045 --> 02:51:54.445]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:51:54.465 --> 02:51:55.786]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:52:01.798 --> 02:52:05.761]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[02:52:05.961 --> 02:52:09.103]  I don't have to tell you, this economy sucks.
[02:52:09.663 --> 02:52:16.748]  Unlike the political elite and Wall Street bankers, you know that debts don't disappear and bailouts have big consequences.
[02:52:17.168 --> 02:52:23.635]  Stock and real estate market bubbles can pop at any moment and evaporate most or all of your retirement savings.
[02:52:23.975 --> 02:52:28.159]  Folks, we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse.
[02:52:28.479 --> 02:52:34.365]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[02:52:34.826 --> 02:52:35.827]  And I'm here to tell you
[02:52:36.107 --> 02:52:41.668]  This may be the best thing that could happen to you if you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately.
[02:52:41.808 --> 02:52:47.489]  Proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[02:52:47.629 --> 02:52:49.530]  And history is about to repeat itself.

[02:53:59.023 --> 02:53:59.865]  30dayfoodsupply.com.
[02:54:17.588 --> 02:54:23.229]  We'll be out filming on a sidewalk somewhere and cops will get out and bow up and walk over like they're trying to scare us.
[02:54:24.210 --> 02:54:28.051]  And I'll just literally laugh at them and say, you know, do we live in an authoritarian country?
[02:54:28.111 --> 02:54:29.351]  Why are you acting menacing to me?
[02:54:30.691 --> 02:54:32.572]  And then they'll usually start backing off.
[02:54:32.592 --> 02:54:37.293]  But if you cower or you blow up at them, you're going to get beat up.
[02:54:37.333 --> 02:54:40.274]  And that's most police I run into honor the First Amendment now.
[02:54:40.314 --> 02:54:40.974]  But more and more,
[02:54:43.015 --> 02:54:44.115]  More and more they come after you.
[02:54:44.215 --> 02:54:52.399]  And on average, it is the quote, left-wing controlled cities where the police are becoming the most aggressive and vicious because they're not left-wing.
[02:54:52.939 --> 02:54:57.161]  The system is using left cover to get away with everything they're doing.
[02:54:57.181 --> 02:55:00.902]  I mean, obviously there's real issues with people persecuting gay folks.
[02:55:01.502 --> 02:55:04.603]  Obviously there's real issues with immigrants being treated horrible and exploited.
[02:55:04.804 --> 02:55:05.684]  They are exploited!
[02:55:07.915 --> 02:55:11.298]  We talk about Latin Americans all day because that's the majority, but they're super hard-working people.
[02:55:11.578 --> 02:55:13.020]  Now Obama wants folks that aren't.
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:20.326]  People that weigh, let me grab them, 600 pounds, folks, and weigh 6X underwear.
[02:55:21.397 --> 02:55:23.218]  To go directly on the welfare system.
[02:55:23.838 --> 02:55:25.218]  Directly to be controlled.
[02:55:25.818 --> 02:55:28.639]  This is a total takeover and it's our final segment.
[02:55:28.939 --> 02:55:36.101]  I want to invite him back whenever he wants to come next week to really drill into what happened to Japanese-Americans and break down that model.
[02:55:36.121 --> 02:55:43.083]  Then another interview about how they're trying to politicize people's sexual preference and trying to create a political underclass they control.
[02:55:44.424 --> 02:55:46.444]  But also a political donating class.
[02:55:46.864 --> 02:55:48.265]  Get into the whole situation.
[02:55:49.105 --> 02:55:50.647]  With the radicalization of Hispanics.
[02:55:51.488 --> 02:55:56.654]  But Professor Daryl Hamamoto, in closing, what are other points you'd like to make about where all this is going?
[02:55:56.975 --> 02:55:58.997]  What you think the ruling establishment is going to do?
[02:55:59.318 --> 02:56:02.442]  Because it's like two runaway trains headed for a collision.
[02:56:03.973 --> 02:56:16.740]  Well, at the University of California, there is a program, they call it Hispanicization, and what they're doing right now is staffing key administrative, upper-level managerial administrative posts with primarily Latinas.
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:18.400]  Not necessarily Latinos, men.
[02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:19.321]  It's the women.
[02:56:19.941 --> 02:56:28.185]  And you're going to see in the popular culture a lot more Latina spokespersons for different agencies in order to get us acclimated to oppression.
[02:56:30.007 --> 02:56:33.809]  From this emerging group that's being set up by the globalists.
[02:56:34.190 --> 02:56:54.165]  By the way, one of the blind spots that people of any ethnicity, really, is that they think that the United States of America, its system of governance, its society, is going to be far more humane under Latino oppression as opposed to Anglo.
[02:56:56.507 --> 02:57:05.774]  I mean, look at Mao Zedong oppressing his fellow Han people, people of the same racial stock.
[02:57:06.175 --> 02:57:07.896]  I mean, that is the height of idiocy.
[02:57:07.996 --> 02:57:15.682]  And I think if there's one single area that has contributed to the silence of my colleagues,
[02:57:16.703 --> 02:57:25.567]  In academia, it's the fact that their firm belief that a minority person is inherently going to be more fair to them and give them a fair deal.
[02:57:25.987 --> 02:57:31.029]  Now that whole fallacy has been invalidated by Barry Sotoro, a.k.a.
[02:57:31.169 --> 02:57:32.590]  Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:57:33.010 --> 02:57:42.254]  So this time around, they're going to give us a woman with a twist, or someone from the GLBT community, to see if they can game that same strategy.
[02:57:42.474 --> 02:57:45.815]  This time around, though, we're a lot more smart.
[02:57:46.375 --> 02:57:50.817]  We won't be fooled again, to paraphrase the great English poet Pete Townshend.
[02:57:52.441 --> 02:58:21.432]  Well said, and it really is scary that it's open, but if you go back to the Roman slavery, again, they would have, it was white women then, mainly German slaves, French slaves, called Gauls at the time, that they would bring the women in to be the oppressors of the slave men, and would say, you take care of them, keep them in line, we won't kill them, and it was the same thing with black communities here, and now they're going to set women up in a fake feminism over men, again, it's just, history repeats itself, it's imperial controlled,
[02:58:22.865 --> 02:58:29.827]  And it's directly targeting men because men will end up wanting to be free, statistically more, so the men have to be gilded.
[02:58:29.867 --> 02:58:32.468]  That's why most horses you get and ride are female.
[02:58:32.648 --> 02:58:34.149]  It's just stallions give you a problem.
[02:58:34.709 --> 02:58:36.409]  It's a targeting of men, really, is what it is.
[02:58:36.449 --> 02:58:40.291]  Nothing against women, it just is a targeting of men by a hyper-male globalist elite.
[02:58:40.591 --> 02:58:41.391]  Thank you, Professor.
[02:58:41.531 --> 02:58:42.271]  Amazing interview.
[02:58:42.751 --> 02:58:43.752]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:43.792 --> 02:58:44.892]  Can't wait to talk to you again, sir.
[02:58:44.912 --> 02:58:45.772]  You're amazing.
[02:58:46.493 --> 02:58:46.893]  Absolutely.
[02:58:46.933 --> 02:58:49.053]  We're going to do a little bit of overdrive for your phone calls.
[02:58:49.113 --> 02:58:49.554]  I apologize.
[02:58:49.574 --> 02:58:49.994]  We'll get to them.
[02:58:50.014 --> 02:58:50.334]  Stay with us.
[02:58:52.222 --> 02:58:54.104]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:58:54.444 --> 02:59:01.972]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:59:02.492 --> 02:59:09.700]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:59:10.020 --> 02:59:14.444]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:59:14.624 --> 02:59:24.792]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:59:25.273 --> 02:59:31.458]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:59:31.758 --> 02:59:34.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:59:34.020 --> 02:59:37.963]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[02:59:38.123 --> 02:59:39.724]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[02:59:40.084 --> 02:59:44.026]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[03:00:08.103 --> 03:00:12.308]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:12.949 --> 03:00:13.750]  You want answers?
[03:00:14.511 --> 03:00:15.432]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:16.073 --> 03:00:19.698]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:20.278 --> 03:00:24.323]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.564 --> 03:00:28.046]  I went to the Caribbean to do some free diving.
[03:00:28.927 --> 03:00:30.248]  Skin diving's the old name of it.
[03:00:31.089 --> 03:00:31.589]  Things like that.
[03:00:31.609 --> 03:00:37.534]  I was going through some photos and I realized it was like I was trying to recreate the Vladimir Putin calendar.
[03:00:37.574 --> 03:00:40.436]  You know, with me skin diving at about 40 feet, which is not that deep.
[03:00:40.896 --> 03:00:42.077]  We've got that image when I was...
[03:00:43.178 --> 03:00:45.401]  On the wreck of the Kitty Wake, a U.S.
[03:00:45.441 --> 03:00:55.192]  destroyer, we'll put that up on screen, that's up on Twitter right now, fighting tyranny on air, land, and sea, and then there's one with me on a horse.
[03:00:56.533 --> 03:00:58.894]  Which we then photoshopped into Planet of the Apes.
[03:00:59.375 --> 03:01:00.815]  That was Darren McBreen's idea.
[03:01:01.376 --> 03:01:04.998]  And so I've decided, I think we may put out a Alex Jones tough guy calendar.
[03:01:05.398 --> 03:01:10.160]  Because they're attacking men in that image, so I think I'm going to start promoting it just to rub it in their face.
[03:01:10.701 --> 03:01:14.843]  Yes girls, I'm being somewhat sarcastic, but I'm actually thinking about doing it as a stunt now.
[03:01:16.189 --> 03:01:18.811]  What would sell better, a Leanne McAdoo calendar or an Alex Jones calendar?
[03:01:19.071 --> 03:01:20.031]  I think we know which one.
[03:01:20.051 --> 03:01:22.553]  I'm going to stop right there.
[03:01:22.873 --> 03:01:25.074]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Indiana.
[03:01:25.475 --> 03:01:26.335]  Matt, you're on the air.
[03:01:26.395 --> 03:01:26.735]  Welcome.
[03:01:27.996 --> 03:01:28.897]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[03:01:29.277 --> 03:01:29.637]  Hey, brother.
[03:01:29.657 --> 03:01:37.062]  Hey, so just quickly, anybody with an Android phone, I went into my messaging and then I went into the settings.
[03:01:37.842 --> 03:01:40.724]  And in the settings of my Android phone, I have emergency alerts.
[03:01:41.556 --> 03:01:47.320]  And in those emergency alerts, I have extreme alerts, severe alerts, amber alerts, all of which I can turn off.
[03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:51.603]  But then at the very top, I also have presidential alerts.
[03:01:52.552 --> 03:01:54.172]  And those I cannot turn off.
[03:01:54.192 --> 03:01:55.173]  Yeah, that's a great headline.
[03:01:55.193 --> 03:01:57.173]  I saw that months ago on one of my friend's phones.
[03:01:57.473 --> 03:02:10.496]  I said, we need to do a headline, you cannot turn off Obama's phone calls, or cannot turn off... And they admit, I told people this a decade ago, the President will just be contacting you constantly, even with video messages.
[03:02:11.236 --> 03:02:14.277]  And it wakes people up all the time, that I know.
[03:02:14.297 --> 03:02:16.057]  I mean, I end up just turning the phone off in another room.
[03:02:16.357 --> 03:02:19.358]  When all these alerts come on, it turns the phone on, even when it's off.
[03:02:20.919 --> 03:02:21.079]  That's
[03:02:40.583 --> 03:02:42.004]  You know, we're living it.
[03:02:42.044 --> 03:02:45.665]  I can see that in North Korea or something else, but... Oh, no, no, I mean, exactly.
[03:02:45.845 --> 03:02:50.788]  They have a list of authoritarianism, and you just go down the list and say, we can't do it all, brother.
[03:02:50.828 --> 03:02:52.168]  You called in to warn us of this.
[03:02:52.528 --> 03:02:53.489]  It reminded me of this.
[03:02:53.529 --> 03:02:54.689]  That's an important story.
[03:02:55.030 --> 03:02:56.170]  Don't wait for us to do it.
[03:02:56.290 --> 03:02:57.090]  Other news sites.
[03:02:57.571 --> 03:02:58.871]  I don't care about being scooped.
[03:02:59.271 --> 03:03:00.192]  Do stories on it.
[03:03:01.681 --> 03:03:05.767]  I mean, so many of the articles we link to on InfoWars.com are now on places like Drudge.
[03:03:06.408 --> 03:03:08.430]  Because Drudge is looking for good news sources as well.
[03:03:08.450 --> 03:03:11.695]  I don't care when people that we've been linking to for a year end up on Drudge.
[03:03:11.755 --> 03:03:12.156]  I like it.
[03:03:12.736 --> 03:03:14.719]  I don't want to be the only guy out there fighting this.
[03:03:14.799 --> 03:03:15.540]  I want to win this.
[03:03:16.690 --> 03:03:19.392]  I get excited when there's professors like Professor Hamamoto.
[03:03:19.833 --> 03:03:23.696]  I get excited when there's, it's all about liberty and freedom.
[03:03:23.716 --> 03:03:27.640]  We don't have to agree on everything, just on the basics of freedom, because the globalists are so bad.
[03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:28.861]  We've got to organize against them.
[03:03:29.221 --> 03:03:33.725]  Matt, do screenshots of it, send it to us, and we'll do a story, or we've got droids here in the office.
[03:03:33.986 --> 03:03:35.247]  That should be on the nightly news tonight.
[03:03:35.507 --> 03:03:37.829]  That guys, pull that up, I'll do a report on it.
[03:03:37.849 --> 03:03:38.310]  That's big.
[03:03:38.350 --> 03:03:39.230]  I don't want to wait on that.
[03:03:39.751 --> 03:03:40.872]  Even going into the holiday.
[03:03:41.292 --> 03:03:42.253]  I'm almost out of time.
[03:03:43.953 --> 03:03:44.674]  You're on the air.
[03:03:44.694 --> 03:03:48.958]  I know there's a great Dre system in the new Chrysler cars.
[03:03:48.998 --> 03:03:49.499]  Go ahead, Dre.
[03:03:49.539 --> 03:03:50.079]  You're on the air.
[03:03:51.380 --> 03:03:51.841]  Yes, man.
[03:03:51.881 --> 03:03:54.003]  I want to say, I'm Hispanic, right?
[03:03:54.323 --> 03:03:56.586]  But I am totally against these open borders.
[03:03:56.646 --> 03:04:02.992]  And what people got to understand is, in America, we're trying to get as many people off welfare and into the workforce.
[03:04:03.332 --> 03:04:08.157]  And if we bring more people in, that's just more people we got to try to get off the welfare system.
[03:04:08.678 --> 03:04:14.201]  I get a lot of ease from this because, of course, I'm Hispanic, so everybody thinks I'm reverse racist or whatever.
[03:04:14.281 --> 03:04:14.721]  You know what?
[03:04:15.141 --> 03:04:19.603]  I've got to end the show and tape the show tomorrow.
[03:04:19.963 --> 03:04:20.624]  This is live.
[03:04:21.044 --> 03:04:26.586]  Why don't we just go to break, end the live broadcast, come back and take these callers for tomorrow.
[03:04:27.527 --> 03:04:29.648]  And then say it's the 33 segment, do 18 minutes.
[03:04:30.068 --> 03:04:31.388]  Because I want to talk to this guy more.
[03:04:31.709 --> 03:04:32.149]  Can we do that?
[03:04:35.530 --> 03:04:36.151]  No reason we can't.
[03:04:37.598 --> 03:04:39.580]  But I mean, John stays connected with us during the recording?
[03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:39.961]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:04:39.981 --> 03:04:42.123]  Alright, total transparency, folks.
[03:04:42.143 --> 03:04:42.904]  We're just planning everything here.
[03:04:43.264 --> 03:04:44.305]  Okay, Dre, don't hang up.
[03:04:44.345 --> 03:04:46.548]  I want to give you the floor to break down and talk about this.
[03:04:46.608 --> 03:04:47.329]  It's very important.
[03:04:47.789 --> 03:04:51.593]  And then we're going to go to Nathan, Matt, George, and Jane.
[03:04:51.813 --> 03:04:55.077]  And you'll have to hear it tomorrow on the July 4th taped transmission.
[03:04:55.317 --> 03:04:56.718]  Nightly News Tonight is important.
[03:04:57.219 --> 03:04:57.900]  7 o'clock Central.
[03:04:58.160 --> 03:04:58.861]  God bless you all.
[03:05:03.038 --> 03:05:09.004]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[03:05:09.204 --> 03:05:13.408]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[03:05:13.768 --> 03:05:18.313]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[03:05:18.713 --> 03:05:21.315]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[03:05:21.636 --> 03:05:26.860]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[03:05:27.080 --> 03:05:33.945]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[03:05:34.466 --> 03:05:38.229]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[03:05:38.589 --> 03:05:39.270]  Nobody else.
[03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:40.711]  It's got Iodine!
[03:06:04.185 --> 03:06:05.246]  In the near future.
[03:06:05.546 --> 03:06:09.668]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[03:06:10.028 --> 03:06:11.048]  Security alert.
[03:06:11.248 --> 03:06:12.969]  This is Homeland Security.
[03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.869]  Analysis.
[03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:16.811]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[03:06:16.831 --> 03:06:21.813]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[03:06:21.853 --> 03:06:22.773]  Prime Directive.
[03:06:22.874 --> 03:06:24.334]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.434 --> 03:06:27.215]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[03:06:27.275 --> 03:06:30.357]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[03:06:30.517 --> 03:06:32.678]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[03:06:32.858 --> 03:06:34.299]  These people are assaulting us.
[03:06:34.339 --> 03:06:36.680]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[03:06:37.180 --> 03:06:38.820]  They are never going to stop.
[03:06:39.120 --> 03:06:43.022]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
