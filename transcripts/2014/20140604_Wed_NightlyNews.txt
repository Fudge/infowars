[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.522]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:22.863]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.203 --> 00:00:26.746]  It's June 4th, 2014, and let's get straight into our top story tonight.
[00:00:27.287 --> 00:00:30.389]  Feds treated Black Friday boycott as terrorist threat.
[00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:39.237]  Now, in a country where they run guns to Mexico and people are too busy to read their Benghazi emails, this is what constitutes terrorism in the United States of America.
[00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:41.599]  This is a leaked email from Tom Wilkins.
[00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.804]  He serves as the Executive Director of the Intelligence Fusion Division Homeland Security Bureau.
[00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:47.564]  Let's see
[00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.712]  Make fun of the people who are there at these strange hours to buy their goods, disruptions in stores, and also wildcat general strikes.
[00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:18.213]  That's where people, they go green and they say, I'm not going to use any power, use any fuel.
[00:01:18.573 --> 00:01:25.475]  Now looking at this list, this seems like nothing more than just minor public nuisances, something that would require possibly a citation.
[00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:34.778]  So with this list of all these terroristic activities that they came up with, this gentleman Tom Wilkins, I just decided to come up with my own brief list.
[00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:36.958]  Limited to three for the sake of time.
[00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:39.559]  Number one on my list is funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.940]  So, you know, you have an administration who says, yes, we have to fight Al-Qaeda here at home.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.801]  That's why you have these TSA checkpoints, these Viper teams and all this stuff.
[00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:50.781]  But we'll fund them abroad.
[00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:54.322]  So, you know, they're our friend today, but tomorrow we have to go out there and fight them.
[00:01:54.342 --> 00:01:56.842]  So that's number one on my potential terror watch list.
[00:01:57.142 --> 00:01:59.543]  Number two, shooting targets of children.
[00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:11.610]  Now if you go to any gun range, especially here in the state of Texas, and you go try to pin up a little picture of Suzy Q or Johnny B Cute, I'm pretty sure the guys are going to toss you out and probably beat you up in the parking lot.
[00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.673]  But if you're the Department of Homeland Security, that's all peachy keen, and if you call them and try to tell them about it, they don't have too much to say.
[00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:23.556]  And our last one for the sake of time, using military vehicles to police the United States of America.
[00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:33.121]  It's always unsettling to me, I guess when I was growing up, and you see futuristic movies like Star Wars, and you think, how can you do this to your own people?
[00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:41.085]  You know, these big corporations, these big police state organizations that are out there inflicting this misery on their own people.
[00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:45.527]  But now, in the year 2014, you have these guys driving these MRAC trucks.
[00:02:45.987 --> 00:02:46.167]  I don't
[00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:04.606]  We're good to go.
[00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:28.602]  And how do they track these trends?
[00:03:28.922 --> 00:03:31.884]  Now they have the Secret Service tracking what you do on Twitter.
[00:03:31.904 --> 00:03:35.185]  And they've been doing this, but now they're just ramping it up a little bit more.
[00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:36.806]  They're being a little bit more transparent.
[00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:50.013]  It says the United States Secret Service is set to purchase software that can track Twitter users in real time, prompting concerns that individuals could face greater harassment over tweets deemed to be threatening or anti-government.
[00:03:50.394 --> 00:03:56.157]  And it says they're seeking out the ability to detect sarcasm and heat maps that will show user trends.
[00:03:57.068 --> 00:04:10.858]  Now it's very disheartening to me that an organization like the Secret Service, which is largely not humorous, I mean they like to spend time with prostitutes, but I guess there's nothing funny about that, but they're saying they want to be able to detect sarcasm.
[00:04:11.278 --> 00:04:20.865]  Meanwhile, you guys may recall the Fox Brothers, the Fox Brothers, excuse me, the guys who do Conrad the Constitution, they got a visit from the Secret Service because they made an episode
[00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:28.251]  Which was clearly satire, joke, humor, whatever you want to call it, where Conrad goes to the future and he assassinates President Obama.
[00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:35.396]  Anybody who knows anything about history knows this is clearly pulled from the assassination of President Lincoln.
[00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:39.059]  And they made a joke about it and then they got a visit from the Secret Service.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.047]  So if you have the Secret Service who can't tell what's a joke on a cartoon show with a walking, talking Constitution, you're going to expect these guys to know what's
[00:04:48.547 --> 00:04:50.327]  Satire and funny on the internet.
[00:04:50.407 --> 00:04:51.848]  It's completely ridiculous to me.
[00:04:52.228 --> 00:04:54.928]  And it's just another way they want to track everything that you do.
[00:04:55.308 --> 00:04:57.149]  Another way just to get you into the system.
[00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:05.010]  And another way to get you into the system, they'll say, instead of a war on poverty, they'll have a war on curfew, so the police can bother you.
[00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.050]  That didn't exactly rhyme, but you know where I'm going with that.
[00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.771]  Baltimore imposes daytime curfew on adolescents.
[00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:15.552]  And it says, we did this because that's just old school common sense.
[00:05:16.212 --> 00:05:24.819]  City Councilman Scott said, if you're going to ask young people to be up and ready for school at 6.30, 7 o'clock in the morning, then they should not be out at 11 p.m.
[00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:25.239]  at night.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.363]  Parents will be fined $500 if their child violates the curfew.
[00:05:29.843 --> 00:05:34.027]  Families may avoid paying the penalty if they attend government counseling.
[00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:34.887]  That's the kicker.
[00:05:34.907 --> 00:05:35.708]  We'll come back to that.
[00:05:36.308 --> 00:05:42.574]  And Kurt Nimmo goes on to point out, the law will turn attention of the police on young people, many who are 14 to 16 years old.
[00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:57.243]  So, now you have the police having, I don't necessarily want to call it a reason, but they have a rationale now to go after the young people, which means that you just have more fuel, more potential conflicts between the young people and the police.
[00:05:57.583 --> 00:06:00.345]  And people know I'm very critical of police brutality.
[00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:03.486]  I know police have a very hard, very thankless job.
[00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:08.709]  And there are plenty of good officers out there who just want to police their neighborhoods and keep everybody safe.
[00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.872]  But now you have another reason to harass people and get these people into the systems
[00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:14.333]  Oh, you're out.
[00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:15.814]  And this is a daytime curfew.
[00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.736]  That's the completely ridiculous thing about it.
[00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:21.759]  So for whatever reason, you're walking around on the street during a school day.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.922]  Now you can get pulled over by John Law.
[00:06:25.222 --> 00:06:25.963]  Hey, where are you going?
[00:06:26.003 --> 00:06:26.684]  Why aren't you in school?
[00:06:26.704 --> 00:06:27.424]  Why aren't you this?
[00:06:27.464 --> 00:06:27.985]  Why aren't you that?
[00:06:28.185 --> 00:06:31.167]  It's like, I'm homeschooled, or whatever your reason may be.
[00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.028]  Well, that's not good enough.
[00:06:32.048 --> 00:06:33.870]  Let's go down to the station.
[00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.552]  And the kicker on this, the $500 fine that can be waived.
[00:06:38.974 --> 00:06:40.376]  If you go to the government counseling.
[00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:41.677]  So this is what they want to do.
[00:06:42.017 --> 00:06:45.581]  You go to the government counseling center with the Obamacare approved doctor.
[00:06:45.882 --> 00:06:50.166]  He's going to say, you and your child, Mr. Smith, do you have any firearms in your house?
[00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:51.307]  And does he beat you?
[00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:52.308]  And all these other things.
[00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.374]  And you know, you could be a good upstanding guy, but maybe your kid was just walking down the street on the wrong day.
[00:06:57.814 --> 00:06:59.815]  So now they get pulled over, now you get pulled into this.
[00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:03.878]  It's going to go from this to CPS showing up at your house and trying to take your kids away.
[00:07:03.918 --> 00:07:05.138]  You say, oh, that's sensational.
[00:07:05.418 --> 00:07:06.259]  That would never happen.
[00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:08.560]  I've done the reports about the lady up north.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.422]  She was refusing to vaccinate her daughter.
[00:07:12.763 --> 00:07:16.165]  So the SWAT team comes and they say she was shooting off guns like Yosemite Sam.
[00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:18.126]  As far as I know, she was never doing that.
[00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.087]  That never came to light.
[00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:21.628]  But you know, that's what they do.
[00:07:21.648 --> 00:07:25.409]  They'll come, send their SWAT team and CPS to come take your kids away if they don't like what you're doing.
[00:07:25.429 --> 00:07:26.670]  But you say, hey, that's sensational.
[00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.491]  That can never happen in the United States of America.
[00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:34.793]  Well, something I didn't expect to see in the United States of America, negotiating for terrorists.
[00:07:35.193 --> 00:07:36.094]  Now we have this article.
[00:07:36.594 --> 00:07:40.158]  Idaho hometown of newly freed soldier cancels planned celebration.
[00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:45.805]  And this is continuing the unhappy, lukewarm welcome of one Sergeant Bergdahl.
[00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:50.750]  And for more on this, the reaction to Bergdahl, we have our very own Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:07.446]  And welcome to the Obama Distraction.
[00:08:07.947 --> 00:08:15.092]  I'm sorry to interrupt your coverage of the VA scandal, but people are starting to get tired of watching the Malaysian flight investigation.
[00:08:15.212 --> 00:08:22.637]  So the President's feelings are starting to get a little bit hurt due to the fact that his government-run health care plan is not working out too good.
[00:08:23.478 --> 00:08:28.281]  So, without further ado, I bring to you the Obama Distraction, Beau Bergdahl.
[00:08:29.656 --> 00:08:35.921]  Bergdahl claimed he was nabbed when he fell behind on patrol, but his fellow soldiers say he simply walked off post.
[00:08:36.842 --> 00:08:45.509]  The military devoted weeks to searching for him, and now some in his battalion are claiming that at least six soldiers were killed during those missions.
[00:08:45.909 --> 00:08:51.674]  All right, we're going to break down the video of the Beau Bergdahl release from the Taliban to American soldiers.
[00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:55.163]  As you can see, Bo is sitting in the back of the Taliban vehicle.
[00:08:55.183 --> 00:08:59.406]  At this point, the Taliban guy is telling him to not come back to Afghanistan.
[00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:01.848]  And I don't think he really means just him overall.
[00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:04.350]  I think he means it's a message to America.
[00:09:04.691 --> 00:09:05.191]  Stay out.
[00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:06.212]  We don't want you here.
[00:09:07.853 --> 00:09:08.334]  Here we are.
[00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:09.535]  Helicopter coming in.
[00:09:10.255 --> 00:09:11.997]  Taliban guys, RPGs on the mountain.
[00:09:13.018 --> 00:09:17.381]  But just remember too though, the government was saying when they found Bergdahl he was in a very weakened state.
[00:09:17.822 --> 00:09:21.705]  Looks to me he's standing up on his own and he is walking away just fine.
[00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:27.689]  Notice that pat on the back from this op right here, making sure he doesn't have a vest on or anything like that.
[00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:31.572]  Alright, he's walking up to the helicopter with these guys.
[00:09:31.652 --> 00:09:33.133]  Notice none of these guys are armed.
[00:09:33.713 --> 00:09:35.315]  The Taliban had the white flag up.
[00:09:36.035 --> 00:09:37.897]  Bill Bergdahl once again gets patted down.
[00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:42.020]  Check to make sure he's got no weapons or anything that's threatening.
[00:09:43.078 --> 00:09:45.720]  And they're going to put him in the helicopter and fly off.
[00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:02.499]  I think?
[00:10:26.109 --> 00:10:28.931]  They found him actively seeking the Taliban.
[00:10:28.971 --> 00:10:35.654]  They heard chatter and the Coochee tribe picked him up asking for Taliban who spoke English.
[00:10:36.234 --> 00:10:37.435]  I mean, it's all right there.
[00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:42.378]  This is a big distraction from the VA, but it is a story worth covering.
[00:10:42.938 --> 00:10:51.581]  Alright, so if you're tired of the mainstream media mass distraction, make sure you tune in to InfoWars and also go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:10:51.821 --> 00:10:56.042]  And don't forget, your username and password can be shared with up to 10 people.
[00:10:56.282 --> 00:11:00.643]  Turn off that Time Warner cable box and tune in to real news.
[00:11:01.123 --> 00:11:01.664]  That's an order.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.761]  And contributing to the growth of the alternative media, now we have this.
[00:11:17.201 --> 00:11:19.162]  Former CBS reporter agrees.
[00:11:19.502 --> 00:11:22.403]  Mainstream media manipulated, controlled by the establishment.
[00:11:22.803 --> 00:11:23.404]  And this is Ms.
[00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:26.465]  Cheryl Atkinson, who served as a correspondent with CNN.
[00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:40.218]  If you can become savvy to this manipulation and sometimes outright propaganda, you can learn to recognize it and sort of filter through it, which I think helps people make up their own minds about what's really going on in the world.
[00:11:40.458 --> 00:11:41.419]  And that's exactly right.
[00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:43.200]  It's just like that movie, They Live.
[00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:49.806]  You know, you put the glasses on and now you can see the magazine with the sexy girl who's really telling you, hey, you need to go cheat on your wife.
[00:11:50.166 --> 00:11:54.587]  Or you see the billboard with the big shiny cards like, you need to consume, you need to give us your money.
[00:11:54.907 --> 00:11:56.968]  So we're the only thing that keeps you happy.
[00:11:57.248 --> 00:12:04.070]  You know, the mainstream media is the only thing, this consumerism, this indulgences, that's the only thing that will keep you happy.
[00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.251]  Not your friends, not your family, not your relationship with God.
[00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:10.232]  Now I want to show you guys this poster we have here.
[00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:15.358]  A lot of times people say, I heard something on CNN and then I read it again in Time Magazine.
[00:12:15.438 --> 00:12:19.803]  Well, you recognize Time Warner owns both CNN and Time Magazine.
[00:12:20.163 --> 00:12:23.727]  Or they'll say, you know, I heard it on Fox and then I read it in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:12:23.747 --> 00:12:29.073]  Well, you can see Fox and Wall Street Journal both line up under the News Corporation and so on and so forth.
[00:12:29.093 --> 00:12:31.076]  You can do this all across the board.
[00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:41.778]  So this is why your media is so controlled, because you have very few people controlling such large masses of information, and then they try to make it relevant, say, well, you heard it here and you heard it here.
[00:12:41.818 --> 00:12:44.298]  Well, you just saw those guys are owned by the same people.
[00:12:44.618 --> 00:12:45.579]  This is how they control you.
[00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:46.819]  This is how they manipulate you.
[00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:50.319]  This is how you get those talking points out on every major network.
[00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:51.640]  So be aware of this, just like Ms.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.200]  Atkinson said, and you can break through the program and you can put on those They Live goggles.
[00:12:56.641 --> 00:12:58.721]  And our last story for the night in this segment,
[00:12:59.281 --> 00:13:03.164]  Full disclosure, the government experiment on preemies hide the risk.
[00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:05.786]  Now this is a very sad tale.
[00:13:06.047 --> 00:13:11.311]  This concerns the University of Alabama at Birmingham where premature babies were born.
[00:13:11.812 --> 00:13:18.117]  So what happens is they approach these low-income single moms who have babies with birth defects.
[00:13:18.437 --> 00:13:21.500]  You know, somebody shows up and says, hey, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:27.303]  And they say we have this program affectionately labeled support where you can bring your child and get your support.
[00:13:27.643 --> 00:13:33.726]  I believe the actual term they said is standard of care to help you and your child in your low-income situation.
[00:13:34.126 --> 00:13:39.829]  So the ladies they sign their children up for these programs but little did they know or so they claim.
[00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:40.829]  That's right.
[00:14:01.095 --> 00:14:04.616]  Related to their lack of oxygen or being given too much oxygen.
[00:14:04.917 --> 00:14:10.439]  So whether it's DU with the troops, not giving the babies oxygen, it's just one giant government experiment.
[00:14:10.459 --> 00:14:11.679]  You say, well that's sensational.
[00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:12.239]  Well it's true.
[00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:15.361]  Go look it up for yourself and you can find out these things for yourself.
[00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:18.642]  Now stay tuned because that's the end of this segment but we'll have more
[00:14:19.182 --> 00:14:22.464]  At the end of the show, Rob Dew will be talking to an advocate of industrial hemp.
[00:14:22.764 --> 00:14:25.386]  So you guys who are interested in that, you can stick around and see that.
[00:14:25.686 --> 00:14:28.147]  And also, the anniversary of Tiananmen Square.
[00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.089]  I'll have a retrospective right after this break.
[00:14:30.409 --> 00:14:36.973]  But first, if you like this broadcast and you would like to see it continue, stop by PrisonPlanet.TV and get yourself a 15-day free trial.

[00:14:54.625 --> 00:15:00.210]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:07.657]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:15:07.817 --> 00:15:11.060]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.961]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:17.765]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:15:17.865 --> 00:15:20.588]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:15:20.768 --> 00:15:26.535]  Nascent Iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:15:26.715 --> 00:15:30.199]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:35.445]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of Nascent Iodine.

[00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.852]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:16:01.952 --> 00:16:04.194]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:16:04.374 --> 00:16:12.659]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:28.290]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.970]  We're good to go.
[00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:06.739]  And welcome back.
[00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:10.941]  In a nation that still has a moderately free press, I wanted to bring you guys this article.
[00:17:11.442 --> 00:17:16.225]  As China eradicates memories of Tiananmen Square, globalists work toward world censorship.
[00:17:17.026 --> 00:17:27.293]  Today, China's state-run media is completely ignoring the massacre, which claimed the lives of several hundred, and Chinese censors are even blocking out foreign newscasts reporting on the anniversary.
[00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:32.977]  So if you guys aren't too up on the 25th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, let's take a look at some of the factoids of it.
[00:17:33.457 --> 00:17:37.181]  This is back in 1989 and it was for various reasons.
[00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:44.108]  Not everybody was out there for the exact same reason but some of the reasons include economic reform, inflation, political corruption.
[00:17:44.408 --> 00:17:50.454]  So you have many students out there peaceful protesting for the large part and then you know things start to get a little dicey.
[00:17:50.514 --> 00:17:53.898]  The military is called in to squash the protest.
[00:17:54.338 --> 00:17:56.640]  So, you know, conflicts happen, people get injured.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.846]  So the military, the bigwigs of the military, they say, we don't want our troops to become sympathetic with the protesters, all these students out here.
[00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:14.194]  So what we're going to do is we're going to bring in a different set of troops that speak a different version of the Chinese language to come in and beat up on the protesters, to brutalize the protesters.
[00:18:14.534 --> 00:18:19.638]  That way, so when the protesters yell at them, they won't be sympathetic because they won't understand what they're saying.
[00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:24.901]  And if you say, this is completely crazy, this happens every year in the United States of America.
[00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:27.482]  That's why they bring foreign troops here to train.
[00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:28.643]  They do it every year in Florida.
[00:18:28.663 --> 00:18:34.346]  They did it just a couple weeks ago or a month or so ago in Florida, bringing these foreign troops in.
[00:18:34.626 --> 00:18:36.227]  And everybody stands there and they clap.
[00:18:36.387 --> 00:18:37.108]  Oh, isn't it so cool?
[00:18:37.128 --> 00:18:39.289]  They're shooting machine guns in the harbor or whatever.
[00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:41.250]  I'm like, these people are training to kill you.
[00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:45.813]  They're not training in some desert scenario to go fight somebody in Iraq or Afghanistan.
[00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:46.934]  They're training in a U.S.
[00:18:46.954 --> 00:18:49.115]  city to take over a U.S.
[00:18:49.155 --> 00:18:49.395]  city.
[00:18:49.816 --> 00:18:50.776]  But that's here and there.
[00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:52.497]  Let's focus on Tiananmen Square.
[00:18:52.778 --> 00:18:54.919]  Let's show you the very famous tank video.
[00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:57.201]  And I'm sure many of you guys have seen this before.
[00:18:57.461 --> 00:18:58.301]  But take a look at this.
[00:18:58.341 --> 00:19:02.244]  This is the footage I've actually never seen until today.
[00:19:02.584 --> 00:19:06.287]  This is the gentleman standing in front of the tank, actually climbing on top of the tank.
[00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:11.911]  Now, they don't show you this in the state-run media, because they don't want you to know that you have power, just like this guy does.
[00:19:12.212 --> 00:19:18.777]  He gets on the tank, he's looking in the portholes, he's yelling at the guys, he's like, hey man, come out here.
[00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:21.780]  He says, hey, the answer to 1984 is 1776, bud.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.923]  And the guy comes out there, he says, hey man, we don't like all that freedom out here, you better get on, boy.
[00:19:26.183 --> 00:19:28.866]  He says, no man, I'm about my freedom, what you want to do?
[00:19:29.426 --> 00:19:32.188]  And this is the kind of attitude that you have to have.
[00:19:32.568 --> 00:19:35.650]  Not just there in Tiananmen Square, but here in the United States of America.
[00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.852]  Because you guys recall the Bundy Rant.
[00:19:38.272 --> 00:19:42.655]  This is where free people, free patriots, gather together in support of Clive and Bundy.
[00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:53.762]  Not just in support of Clive and Bundy, but just the notion that you can own your own private property, have your cattle grazed on land, and not have to pay a bunch of fees to a bunch of bureaucrats who come out there with their guns
[00:19:54.022 --> 00:19:57.443]  And with their armored vehicles and come out there and bug their eyes out at you.
[00:19:57.704 --> 00:20:02.566]  But if you do the same, if you show up on a horse with a little six shooter on your hip, oh now you're a terrorist.
[00:20:02.606 --> 00:20:03.726]  Now you're a domestic threat.
[00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:08.228]  Now Harry Rees will get up there and talk about you and that you're nothing but a domestic terrorist.
[00:20:08.268 --> 00:20:09.629]  No, you're not a terrorist, you're a patriot.
[00:20:09.949 --> 00:20:10.729]  Just like this guy.
[00:20:10.769 --> 00:20:12.750]  He says, no, I don't want your tanks out here.
[00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.611]  The people at the Bundy Ranch said, no, we don't want your police state here.
[00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:16.471]  Leave us alone.
[00:20:16.511 --> 00:20:17.892]  We're going to be out here in peace.
[00:20:18.252 --> 00:20:27.959]  So whether it's Tiananmen Square in 1989 or the Bundy Ranch in 2014, you have to continue to fight for your rights and that's what we'll do right after this break when Rob Due talks to an advocate of industrial hemp.
[00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:30.761]  Stay tuned, this is the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:46.570]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.832]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:20:49.032 --> 00:20:54.217]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:20:54.377 --> 00:20:59.482]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:20:59.622 --> 00:21:02.723]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:21:03.003 --> 00:21:06.924]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:21:07.124 --> 00:21:11.445]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:21:11.525 --> 00:21:21.667]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:21:21.867 --> 00:21:26.128]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.

[00:22:50.407 --> 00:22:52.087]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:22:52.567 --> 00:23:01.509]  Our next guest has been fighting for the legalization for hemp manufacturing and growing here in the United States since the late nineties.
[00:23:01.769 --> 00:23:02.789]  His name is Eric Pollitt.
[00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:16.172]  He's head of Global Hemp Incorporated and also the website GlobalHemp.com and he recently helped author HB 5085 which is the Illinois Hemp Research Bill and he joins us to tell us about that and other
[00:23:17.032 --> 00:23:27.636]  Aspects in ways that we could get hemp grown in the United States because there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to grow something that has no THC in it that could get you high and can be used for many other things.
[00:23:27.876 --> 00:23:29.577]  And without further ado, let's bring him in here.
[00:23:30.197 --> 00:23:31.057]  How's it going today, Eric?
[00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:32.418]  It's going great.
[00:23:32.458 --> 00:23:33.398]  Thanks for having me on, Rob.
[00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:33.918]  Great.
[00:23:33.938 --> 00:23:37.640]  So tell us a little bit about this bill, how it got through and your other efforts.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:42.942]  You've been doing this since the early 2000s trying to get a bill introduced and now you finally had some success.
[00:23:43.002 --> 00:23:43.762]  So take it away.
[00:23:45.195 --> 00:23:54.803]  Yeah, 1998-1999 there were two different research bills here in Illinois, and both of them passed the House and the Senate, but Governor Ryan at the time vetoed both of them.
[00:23:55.444 --> 00:23:58.086]  And after that happened, basically that was it.
[00:23:58.346 --> 00:24:02.690]  There were several states that were doing legislation, with North Dakota being the first state.
[00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:14.899]  But also, most of the legislation during that time would have been for research, but it was following the federal laws that require researchers to get a permit from the DEA.
[00:24:15.379 --> 00:24:24.285]  And the problem is, the DEA will not give anyone a permit, save the one that they did give to Dr. David West, who did research in Hawaii.
[00:24:24.846 --> 00:24:26.187]  So fast forward to today,
[00:24:27.307 --> 00:24:40.573]  The bill that I helped co-author, which was HB 5085, it originally started off as a licensing that would allow farmers to grow it, although the federal level doesn't allow for it.
[00:24:40.893 --> 00:24:49.096]  But it was shot down by the Illinois Department of Agriculture, not because they were against hemp by any means whatsoever at all, it just was a funding issue.
[00:24:49.176 --> 00:24:55.879]  So the bill was rewritten to be a research bill, which coincides very well with the
[00:24:56.139 --> 00:25:06.681]  The Farm Bill that was passed this year, and the Farm Bill allows, first of all, it makes the distinction in the language that hemp and marijuana are not the same.
[00:25:06.861 --> 00:25:07.861]  Hemp is what it is.
[00:25:08.421 --> 00:25:11.742]  It's a low THC variety of cannabis and it has lots of uses.
[00:25:12.722 --> 00:25:22.704]  And then what the Farm Bill did in addition to that is that it allows universities and state departments of agriculture to do research on hemp.
[00:25:23.384 --> 00:25:28.245]  Right, so we don't have to get permission from our federal masters just to start growing a plant.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:50.050]  Well, the folks in Kentucky just ran into a problem.
[00:25:50.191 --> 00:25:52.596]  They had legislation already in place last year.
[00:25:52.616 --> 00:25:55.303]  They had eight research projects lined up.
[00:25:55.891 --> 00:25:59.772]  And they imported hemp seed from Italy into Chicago, and U.S.
[00:25:59.812 --> 00:26:02.653]  Customs looked at it and said, hey, wait a minute, this is viable hemp seed.
[00:26:03.093 --> 00:26:04.834]  It will sprout and grow into a plant.
[00:26:05.894 --> 00:26:09.515]  Importing hemp seed that's sterilized, such as from Canada, is fine.
[00:26:10.155 --> 00:26:15.177]  So they called the Kentucky Agricultural Commissioner, and he said, hey, look, no, this is fine.
[00:26:15.197 --> 00:26:16.057]  Look at the Farm Bill.
[00:26:16.457 --> 00:26:23.619]  So they sent it down to Louisville, Kentucky, and that's where the DEA got involved with Customs, and there's a legal battle that happened for
[00:26:24.279 --> 00:26:30.904]  Approximately three weeks and as of last week that hemp is actually in the ground right now as we speak.
[00:26:31.907 --> 00:26:35.648]  And the problem is the DEA said, hey, you need a Controlled Substance Act permit.
[00:26:36.148 --> 00:26:37.829]  And they said, look at the Farm Bill.
[00:26:37.849 --> 00:26:40.630]  The Farm Bill says no, no DEA permit required.
[00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:52.953]  So, you know, as I joke, it's kind of like the cartoon of the stork eating the frog and the frog sitting there, you know, choking on the stork's throat, you know, trying to get that last bit.
[00:26:52.973 --> 00:26:54.614]  They don't want to give up that easily.
[00:26:55.154 --> 00:27:01.376]  And fortunately, Kentucky is now paved the way for the rest of the states that want to continue with hemp research.
[00:27:02.108 --> 00:27:02.889]  Well that sounds good.
[00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:15.163]  And you actually, on your website, you posted a map of the 50 states, and it has green for the states that are ready to start growing hemp, blue for the states that aren't, and then gray for the ones who are kind of in a gray area.
[00:27:15.183 --> 00:27:22.632]  Tell us a little bit about this map, and why is it that the southern states, the areas where you could grow hemp year-round, aren't interested in growing this product, it seems?
[00:27:23.612 --> 00:27:35.381]  Well, the one thing I look at is even here in Illinois, when they were asked questions about, you know, such as the legislator that did this bill, wasn't really for hemp before.
[00:27:36.302 --> 00:27:42.947]  And the thing is, is any hemp legislation before this farm bill that passed this year, it was really just ceremonial.
[00:27:43.067 --> 00:27:51.153]  It's been a very grassroots, it's been a very, it's protesting to the federal government, hey look, you know, we want the chance to grow hemp, but
[00:27:51.793 --> 00:27:55.435]  Federal law supersedes state law, so it's kind of the state's rights.
[00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:57.116]  It's really been a state's rights issue.
[00:27:57.156 --> 00:27:58.597]  It's been a grassroots issue.
[00:27:59.437 --> 00:28:05.320]  And several states have passed legislation and it's been ceremonial more than anything else.
[00:28:05.781 --> 00:28:15.546]  But you are correct when you look at the map and you coincide that the cotton producing states such as Texas have not passed any legislation.
[00:28:15.606 --> 00:28:17.007]  However, California has.
[00:28:23.693 --> 00:28:29.194]  Right, and you were telling me earlier about an issue, I guess you're calling it peak cotton.
[00:28:29.914 --> 00:28:30.855]  Explain to people what that is.
[00:28:30.895 --> 00:28:32.275]  It's not like we're running out of cotton.
[00:28:32.335 --> 00:28:35.616]  It's not like it won't grow out of the ground, but where you can grow it, there's a problem.
[00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.871]  Yeah, there's a term that I kind of coined.
[00:28:39.171 --> 00:28:41.871]  I haven't heard it before, but I call it peak cotton.
[00:28:42.312 --> 00:28:45.773]  And what that is, is that cotton is grown everywhere in the world where it will grow.
[00:28:46.753 --> 00:28:51.054]  India, China, Egypt, the southern United States.
[00:28:51.854 --> 00:28:54.455]  And the thing is, is that as the developing nations
[00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.891]  Get a higher standard of living.
[00:28:56.931 --> 00:29:05.736]  There's two things that regardless of the religion or the language or anything else, there's two things that people do once they start having a little bit of extra money in their pocket.
[00:29:05.817 --> 00:29:07.858]  Number one, they like to eat meat.
[00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:10.499]  Number two, they like to have more clothing.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.963]  And the thing is is that there's only a certain amount of land that cotton can be grown on
[00:29:16.662 --> 00:29:26.328]  And so you run into the problem that until just in the last 10 years, cotton had upwards to a 90% market share of clothing.
[00:29:26.548 --> 00:29:31.191]  However, now it's dropped down market share wise, but not volume wise.
[00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:37.715]  And what that means is, is that more and more people are buying more clothing, but they have to substitute another fiber.
[00:29:38.436 --> 00:29:53.137]  So what they've done is is they've been using polyester in the last 10 years and so synthetic has gone up quite a bit Because like I said people in developing nations, they want to go from having say five shirts to having 30 shirts in their wardrobe
[00:29:53.732 --> 00:29:54.052]  And so,
[00:30:10.049 --> 00:30:10.889]  We're good to go!
[00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:37.354]  Right, and I was reading also in one of your articles that retail, just retail sales of hemp products exceeds $580 million.
[00:30:37.394 --> 00:30:42.496]  So this is obviously a huge market that we can bring to the United States and bring jobs to people.
[00:30:42.997 --> 00:30:48.740]  In addition to growing it, you have the manufacturing process and those type of deals that can be brought about.
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.681]  What are the different uses of hemp?
[00:30:50.841 --> 00:30:55.503]  You know, people know about the paper and the clothing, but what are some other uses out there that can be used with this product?
[00:30:56.363 --> 00:31:00.707]  Yeah, if you look at hemp in general, it can be split into two different crops.
[00:31:00.727 --> 00:31:03.129]  You have the seed crop and you have a fiber crop.
[00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:09.435]  So Canada grows primarily seed crop and the seeds go into different foods.
[00:31:10.196 --> 00:31:13.299]  So they can get rid of the shell and they have what's called hemp hearts.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.705]  Or they can take the seed and press it for oil and they also have a protein powder.
[00:31:20.325 --> 00:31:21.006]  And those are all
[00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:23.100]  The majority are organic foods.
[00:31:24.141 --> 00:31:31.688]  And on the side of fiber, fiber's quite a bit different, with the low end being paper, and the high end being textiles.
[00:31:31.788 --> 00:31:34.871]  But in between the two, you have composite grade.
[00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:47.582]  And what they're doing is that Mercedes-Benz actually pioneered the research back in the late 1980s, because Germany has, I think it's 80 million people, but it's in an area about the size of Montana.
[00:31:48.303 --> 00:31:52.166]  And what they did is Germany said, hey, we built the last landfill.
[00:31:52.826 --> 00:31:55.728]  And they said, we can't just keep throwing all this stuff in the landfill.
[00:31:55.768 --> 00:31:59.651]  So there's never been a problem with recycling the metal of a car.
[00:32:00.031 --> 00:32:04.034]  But the problem is the interior, the dashboards, all that kind of stuff.
[00:32:04.574 --> 00:32:14.521]  And also to increase the fuel mileage, what they did is they came up with a matting material that's 50% polypropylene, which is a plastic, and 50% natural fiber.
[00:32:17.188 --> 00:32:18.569]  We're good to go!
[00:32:33.484 --> 00:32:37.266]  Uh, and then it gets the equivalent of the EPA off the company's backs.
[00:32:37.866 --> 00:32:40.487]  Uh, and it's recyclable material at the end of its life.
[00:32:40.987 --> 00:32:43.348]  And like I said earlier, it's a lighter weight material.
[00:32:43.468 --> 00:32:50.011]  So, uh, if you can decrease the weight of the car by, you know, 20 pounds, everything counts.
[00:32:51.418 --> 00:33:08.574]  In doing that in the composite markets are huge with plastics Plastics in general are the third largest industry in the United States after automobiles and steel so plastics are huge there's a huge growth potential for it and Plastics are dependent on the price of petroleum.
[00:33:08.994 --> 00:33:15.360]  We know that the price of petroleum is significantly higher now than it was before Hurricane Katrina and
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.683]  And there's a growing demand throughout the world for more and more petroleum, so we don't really see the price going down.
[00:33:21.323 --> 00:33:27.067]  So what they do is they use the hemp fiber kind of as a reinforcement, kind of like rebar in concrete.
[00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:39.494]  And the hemp fiber is very strong, and that's what allows for, when you're sitting in your car and you can put your elbow on the car door panel, there's a 90 degree angle there.
[00:33:40.595 --> 00:33:42.539]  Only hemp and flax can really do that.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:49.314]  So, there's a company in northern Indiana, Elkhart, in Elkhart, Indiana, called Flexform Technologies.
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:34:01.870]  And they produce that matting material, but presently they're importing all the hemp fiber from Europe, and they use actually more cannaf, which is a subtropical crop related to okra and cotton.
[00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.371]  And so it doesn't really grow in the United States that well.
[00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:07.353]  And they bring in all the cannaf from Southeast Asia.
[00:34:08.053 --> 00:34:19.459]  And the thing is, is if we grow hemp in the United States, it really is a bulky material, so it's not good to transport it over very long distances.
[00:34:20.154 --> 00:34:25.056]  So that's what opens up the idea of what's referred to as bioregional.
[00:34:25.416 --> 00:34:26.637]  And we have a lot of land, too.
[00:34:26.797 --> 00:34:28.718]  There's a lot of land in the United States to grow.
[00:34:29.218 --> 00:34:31.619]  We have a great climate for it.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.101]  And I want to get back to the car thing.
[00:34:34.141 --> 00:34:36.962]  Is it true that Henry Ford made a car out of mostly hemp?
[00:34:37.816 --> 00:34:58.131]  Yeah, well, what he did is, the car door panels, there's a video online, back in the early 1940s, he produced a plastic car door panel, and there's a video of it that shows Henry Ford with an axe, you know, like a five-pound sledgehammer, and he's swinging at the car, and it's just bouncing off.
[00:34:58.511 --> 00:34:59.812]  That was technology from the 1940s.
[00:34:59.932 --> 00:35:01.894]  Henry Ford had that.
[00:35:03.951 --> 00:35:08.474]  And today, take a sledgehammer to a car and see how well it holds up to it.
[00:35:08.874 --> 00:35:13.136]  Now, you know, there's lots of reasons why perhaps we don't have that.
[00:35:13.156 --> 00:35:16.078]  You know, it's good for creating lots of jobs.
[00:35:16.738 --> 00:35:23.482]  You and I barely bump into one another and we have to have auto body shop, you know, do, you know, $3,000 worth of work.
[00:35:24.202 --> 00:35:30.426]  But that Henry Ford had that and the thing, what was going on at that time period was what was called Kimmergy.
[00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.743]  And what they did is they were taking chemistry.
[00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:33.844]  It's kind of like metallurgy.
[00:35:34.245 --> 00:35:38.848]  And what they wanted is Henry Ford's original number one customer were farmers.
[00:35:39.489 --> 00:35:41.971]  And so Henry Ford figured, hey, they scratched my back.
[00:35:41.991 --> 00:35:43.091]  I want to scratch their back.
[00:35:43.452 --> 00:35:48.796]  And he wanted chemical inputs to not come from petroleum, but he wanted them to come from agriculture.
[00:35:49.452 --> 00:36:11.279]  And so, what I found personally, and I put on the Global Hemp website almost 15 years ago, was if you take a, I think it's a $5 note from about 1912 or 1915, you'll find on the back of that note, on the left-hand side, there are guys working out in a field on horseback, and it looks like hemp.
[00:36:12.307 --> 00:36:13.249]  That they're harvesting.
[00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.353]  And then on the right shows industry.
[00:36:15.694 --> 00:36:22.889]  And that was part of that Kimmerji movement was to have your raw materials come from the farm and be used in industry.
[00:36:23.604 --> 00:36:42.632]  Now, Henry Ford and Dow Chemical were both in that mindset, but then there was the other camp, and that was DuPont, which is a chemical company, and General Motors, which actually DuPont pretty much owned General Motors, and they were after using petroleum to produce all the different parts, including the fuel and everything else.
[00:36:43.294 --> 00:36:43.574]  Right.
[00:36:44.134 --> 00:36:51.176]  And it's an amazing synergy that can be done here in the United States and we could have a part of that world market if we just put our minds to it.
[00:36:51.436 --> 00:37:00.359]  And I just want to put up a quick graphic that I made earlier today and basically it's a slogan for Texas because I think Texas is definitely one of those places you could
[00:37:00.919 --> 00:37:01.460]  We're good to go.
[00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:20.080]  Eric, tell us a little bit about Global Hemp.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.942]  You guys sell a bunch of different hemp products.
[00:37:22.682 --> 00:37:23.463]  Tell us about it.
[00:37:23.683 --> 00:37:24.323]  Yes, we do.
[00:37:24.343 --> 00:37:29.047]  The Global Hemp started in 1996, and it started off as an educational website.
[00:37:29.287 --> 00:37:31.429]  It was the Global Hemp News that ran for several years.
[00:37:32.269 --> 00:37:41.356]  But then to basically follow through was to have the store, because in 1999-2000, the Illinois legislation didn't go through.
[00:37:41.396 --> 00:37:45.039]  We wanted to build up a processing plant here in Illinois.
[00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:50.760]  But then the Global Hemp Store has basically been what the company's been doing in the meantime.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.280]  And there's all kinds of products.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.701]  There's clothing products.
[00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:58.862]  We have our own line of Global Hemp Cord, which is a type of twine.
[00:37:59.022 --> 00:38:01.002]  And then we have lots of food products.
[00:38:01.582 --> 00:38:04.643]  And body care products are two very popular categories.
[00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:09.724]  And the food products, the oil is high in omega-3, which is good for your heart.
[00:38:10.204 --> 00:38:11.644]  And the protein is very good.
[00:38:11.904 --> 00:38:14.345]  It's comparable to whey protein powder.
[00:38:15.291 --> 00:38:18.193]  And then there's the hemp hearts, which people love.
[00:38:18.233 --> 00:38:19.874]  You can sprinkle them on just about anything.
[00:38:20.574 --> 00:38:23.416]  And a lot of fantastic products made out of hemp.
[00:38:23.476 --> 00:38:27.199]  And that's what we like to get behind the products and show them to people.
[00:38:27.279 --> 00:38:32.522]  And when people try them out, that they can actually see that, hey, these are the best of the best products.
[00:38:32.762 --> 00:38:36.884]  And how much of these products do you have to import from out of the United States that aren't manufactured here?
[00:38:37.865 --> 00:38:40.527]  All the food products are actually coming from Canada.
[00:38:40.547 --> 00:38:42.468]  They're grown in Canada and processed in Canada.
[00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:51.254]  All the clothing and the twine comes from China, just because Canada and the European Union don't grow textile-grade hemp fiber.
[00:38:52.515 --> 00:38:54.976]  And then the body care products are all from the United States.
[00:38:58.374 --> 00:39:02.756]  Hemp just seems like a commodity that we could easily be producing here in the United States.
[00:39:02.816 --> 00:39:13.020]  It's time that we put away the torches and pitchforks and try to stab hemp with the same thing that we go after regular marijuana with, medical marijuana.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.641]  And it's time that I think we grow it here in the United States.
[00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:19.203]  And thank you for joining us, Eric Pollett of GlobalHemp.com.
[00:39:19.583 --> 00:39:23.164]  We appreciate your fighting for this product and making it happen here in the United States.
