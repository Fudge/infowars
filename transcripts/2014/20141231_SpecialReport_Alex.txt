[00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:20.703]  As 2014 draws to a close, I say my prediction and hope for the new year would be to see less persecution of gun owners in general, and in particular, to see HB 195 pass in the state of Texas.
[00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:22.985]  This is the constitutional carry bill.
[00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:29.550]  Gun advocates have talked to Governor-elect Greg Abbott, who said he will sign the bill should it make it all the way to his desk.
[00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.673]  So I'm here in Austin at the Republican Party of Texas board meeting.
[00:00:34.662 --> 00:00:38.947]  And today I got the opportunity to go to luncheon with Governor-Elect Greg Abbott.
[00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:42.091]  I met him and informed him that I work with gun rights.
[00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:44.033]  And I brought to him HB 195.
[00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:52.947]  Which is Representative Stickland's constitutional carry bill that he's pre-filed for the 2015 session.
[00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:57.930]  And Mr. Abbott has agreed previously that he would sign this bill if it comes to his desk.
[00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.992]  Well, I asked him, hey, could I get your autograph?
[00:01:00.032 --> 00:01:02.393]  Could you sign this print-up of this bill?
[00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:04.755]  And he agreed and he reaffirmed that he would be happy
[00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:15.017]  One of the most recognizable supporters of HB 195 is Master Sergeant CJ Grisham.
[00:01:15.317 --> 00:01:16.657]  Can I ask you what I was doing wrong?
[00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:25.661]  So you can just stop anybody in the world from rudely displaying a gun?
[00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:27.242]  How am I rudely displaying a gun?
[00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:27.862]  I'm walking!
[00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:38.613]  Since that video, Grisham has become nationally famous, or potentially infamous depending on your point of view, for his gun rights group, Open Carry Texas.
[00:01:39.113 --> 00:01:48.061]  After countless rallies, unconstitutional arrests, and negative media coverage, the men and women who shall come and take it may finally attain what they've been after.
[00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:52.725]  And we see more and more officers standing up for people's Second Amendment rights.
[00:01:53.445 --> 00:02:00.170]  And if you would like to do your part to keep and bear arms, be sure to attend the rally January 13th at the Texas Capitol.
[00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.972]  And I'll leave you now with something for the skeptics.
[00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:08.976]  The people who say gun rights are fine as they are, and there is in fact nobody trying to take your guns away.
[00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:12.838]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.701]  Nobody's trying to take your toys.
[00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:17.762]  They haven't taken the guns.
[00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:19.723]  Van assault weapons.
[00:02:21.152 --> 00:02:22.893]  It says right here.
[00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:23.754]  That's all semi-auto.
[00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:24.895]  Shut up!
[00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:25.816]  And I'll be brief.
[00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:32.841]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:40.287]  But, because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your sign legitimate shortly.
[00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:41.808]  So you hang on to that.
[00:02:43.138 --> 00:02:44.179]  Mayor Bloomberg, how you doing?
[00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.060]  Jason, I grew up in Brooklyn.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.823]  In the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your entire security team?
[00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:52.046]  You'll get back to me?
[00:02:52.427 --> 00:02:53.608]  Would you like a sip of my soda?
[00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.611]  Every day, some kind of anti-violence, anti-gun message.
[00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:01.352]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[00:03:01.832 --> 00:03:07.594]  One thing that I think is clear with young people, and with adults as well, is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:12.276]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday, and then only do it every Monday.
[00:03:12.336 --> 00:03:19.219]  We need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:29.667]  California Senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the Assault Weapons Bill passed in the face of ferocious opposition from the National Rifle Association.
[00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:32.029]  She says she got the best she could.
[00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:46.601]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:48.363]  I could not do that.
[00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:50.751]  The votes weren't here.
[00:03:59.497 --> 00:04:04.479]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
