[00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:21.836]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:27.960]  I'm your host, Rob Due, and today's date is November 19th, 2014, and here's a look at what's in store.
[00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:38.167]  Tonight, a 10-year-old boy gets suspended from school for pointing an imaginary ray gun.
[00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:42.229]  Plus, the government surveillance dragnet is now eating its own.
[00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.892]  Former CIA analyst Ray McGovern joins Rob Due.
[00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:49.094]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:58.054]  I want to start off tonight's show with a couple articles from the Washington Post.
[00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:02.676]  The first one, and this is from Glenn Kessler, Explainer.
[00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:07.718]  What Gruber meant when he said, if CBO scored mandated taxes, the bill dies.
[00:01:08.098 --> 00:01:16.582]  Now you've seen the video out there that's been all over the internet of this Jonathan Gruber character saying, if CBO scored the mandated taxes, the bill dies.
[00:01:17.142 --> 00:01:25.911]  Well, this Explainer article, also listed as Fact Checker, goes on to talk about how, oh, you don't really understand what he meant.
[00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:29.314]  You're too stupid, once again, to understand what he really meant.
[00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:31.196]  And this is what they say, what he meant.
[00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.737]  Let's go to the facts section.
[00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:40.485]  CBO's perspective, the mandate penalty called in the law is a shared responsibility payment and was always deemed to be revenue.
[00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:46.752]  The mandate was considered an involuntary payment and would thus be considered government revenue.
[00:01:47.112 --> 00:01:51.738]  So you see, it's not taxes, it's an involuntary payment, which is government revenue.
[00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.840]  That sounds like a lot of wordsmithing to me.
[00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:55.622]  It goes on to describe
[00:01:56.443 --> 00:01:57.964]  Why it's not considered taxes?
[00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:17.193]  Because, if the consumer is likely to be able to choose among a number of insurance plans with different degrees of comprehensiveness, if there are plans with different levels of coverage that will cover a broad enough range to offer the consumer a meaningful choice, is the consumer likely to be able to choose among several different insurance companies competing on price?
[00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:23.296]  Well, yeah, you are going to get to compete among different insurance companies, but they're all basically offering you the same screw job.
[00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:30.859]  You know, it's going to be higher deductibles, higher copayments, higher everything, higher premiums, higher monthly payments.
[00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.420]  Everything's going to go up under Obamacare.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.900]  Why?
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.942]  Because we're now going to pay for more people that can't pay for themselves under this bloated healthcare system.
[00:02:39.582 --> 00:02:55.058]  So instead of actually looking at the health care system and trying to fix it, what we're going to do is, well, I don't want to call it taxes because the explainer didn't call it taxes, they called it government revenue and it's an involuntary payment and also a shared responsibility payment.
[00:02:55.078 --> 00:02:56.260]  So it's not taxes.
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.883]  Then there's the second article from the Washington Post.
[00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:03.306]  This is a little more based on fact.
[00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:05.247]  We also linked it on InfoWars.com.
[00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:09.489]  Thanks to Jonathan Gruber for revealing the Obamacare deception.
[00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:10.870]  This is from Mark Thyssen.
[00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:25.757]  In a new video that surfaced Friday, Gruber explains that the Obama administration passed the so-called Cadillac tax on high value employer health plans by mislabeling it and calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on the people.
[00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.880]  We know it's a tax on the people who hold these insurance plans, of course.
[00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:35.930]  We just taxed the insurance companies, they pass on the higher prices, it ends up being the same thing.
[00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:44.002]  The ruse Gruber says was very clever, basic exploitation, and with the lack of the economic understanding of the American voter.
[00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:50.461]  So here you got two articles from the same newspaper saying completely different things.
[00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:55.943]  One trying to say, well, they're just picking about one thing that he said and saying, oh, he really didn't mean that.
[00:03:55.983 --> 00:03:58.044]  This is what he really meant, which is total BS.
[00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:01.666]  And then the article by Mark Thiessen saying, look, there's more.
[00:04:02.446 --> 00:04:03.827]  He totally thinks you're stupid.
[00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:05.788]  And basically, we are stupid.
[00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:07.430]  We're stupid for letting them pass this.
[00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.232]  We're stupid for not holding the Republicans accountable for getting it repealed.
[00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:12.013]  So what are they doing?
[00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:17.477]  They're voting on the Keystone Pipeline again, which is probably going to get shelled by the Senate or vetoed by the President.
[00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:20.439]  They're not going after Obamacare, and they never will go after Obamacare.
[00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.541]  They're going to keep this in because, well, back in
[00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:25.121]  I don't know.
[00:04:42.742 --> 00:04:44.003]  But what does this mean for me and you?
[00:04:44.143 --> 00:04:46.445]  Well, the article out of Zero Hedge today says it all.
[00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:50.868]  One reader's shocked response upon learning his health insurance cost just doubled.
[00:04:51.388 --> 00:04:56.171]  The cost goes from $281 a month to $555 a month, an increase of $274, or 97%.
[00:04:57.973 --> 00:05:00.074]  So my wife and I own a small business.
[00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:02.536]  We've been buying health insurance on our own for ourselves and our two kids.
[00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:09.921]  The cost was about $600 per month with a $5,200 deductible and a $6,800 total out-of-pocket expense for a family of four.
[00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:23.134]  After spending months trying to register for the Affordable Care Act in late 2013 and early 2014, my kids got put on our state's insurance at no cost, and my wife and I bagged an ACA policy at a subsidized cost of $2.81 per month.
[00:05:23.634 --> 00:05:28.339]  Well, now they've been notified that it's going up to $5.55 per month, an increase of 97%.
[00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:32.494]  And that's not all.
[00:05:32.554 --> 00:05:38.077]  We've shown other articles where people's premiums were going up, astronomical rates, upwards of 500%.
[00:05:39.057 --> 00:05:42.378]  We also got an email from our whistleblower hotline, and I want to show it to you.
[00:05:42.398 --> 00:05:44.279]  I've blocked out their email and telephone number.
[00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:49.541]  I sympathize with the reader who saw their health insurance rates go up so dramatically.
[00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:52.822]  Me, my wife, and I also saw our rates go way up.
[00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:55.543]  They went from $740 a month to over $1,430 a month, and the deductible is the worst part.
[00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.571]  I don't know.
[00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:18.019]  And that's so that's all they're up front cost.
[00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:19.599]  And that's the big scam about insurance.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.443]  So on top of the premiums that you're paying each month, you're also going to have a really high deductible that you have to meet before the insurance even kicks in.
[00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:28.244]  It's going to be $6,000.
[00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:30.645]  Some people it's $10,000.
[00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:32.486]  You're lucky if it's under three.
[00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:36.968]  So really anything you go in for, you're never going to meet that deductible.
[00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.789]  Or if you do, then after that, they're only going to pay a certain percentage.
[00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:41.230]  So you're still going to be paying.
[00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:43.443]  This is a total screw job.
[00:06:56.543 --> 00:06:56.743]  I think?
[00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:30.044]  This was from Michael Schneider of Economic Collapse Forum.
[00:07:30.404 --> 00:07:33.786]  Three of the ten largest economies in the world have already fallen into recession.
[00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:34.986]  Is the U.S.
[00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:35.386]  next?
[00:07:36.587 --> 00:07:39.248]  Three of the ten largest companies on the planet have already fallen into recession.
[00:07:39.728 --> 00:07:46.070]  Six years on from the financial crash that brought the world to its knees, red light warnings once again are flashing on the dashboard of the global economy.
[00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.051]  That was Prime Minister David Cameron.
[00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:50.712]  So, why are people freaking out?
[00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:55.874]  Well, the economy of Japan, the third largest economy in the entire planet, is a total basket case at this point.
[00:07:55.914 --> 00:08:00.436]  Many believe the Japanese will be on the leading edge of the next great global economic crisis.
[00:08:00.816 --> 00:08:06.278]  That's why it's so alarming that Japan has dipped into recession again for the fourth time in six years.
[00:08:09.252 --> 00:08:10.633]  Nation on there is Brazil.
[00:08:10.693 --> 00:08:15.276]  Brazil has the seventh largest economy on the globe and has already fallen into recession for quite a few months.
[00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:18.838]  You've seen the inflation going out of there, the blackouts, everything.
[00:08:18.858 --> 00:08:21.260]  That's what you get when you get a socialist economy.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.803]  And then the ninth largest economy in the world, Italy, has also fallen into recession.
[00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:27.124]  But it gets better.
[00:08:27.164 --> 00:08:30.527]  They also look at the unemployment rates of different countries in Europe.
[00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:31.828]  So let's go to that list.
[00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:32.729]  We got France at 10.2%.
[00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:33.129]  Poland at 11.5%.
[00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:33.469]  Italy at 12.6%.
[00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.870]  Portugal at 13.1%.
[00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:34.811]  Spain and Greece over 20%.
[00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:35.311]  Spain's at 23.6%.
[00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:35.691]  Greece at 26.4%.
[00:08:46.741 --> 00:08:51.983]  Of course, they tell you the unemployment rate in the United States is hovering around 5%, but we know that's a bunch of bull.
[00:08:52.003 --> 00:08:54.704]  We know there's people out there who aren't even looking anymore for jobs.
[00:08:55.044 --> 00:09:01.966]  That's why they're not being registered as unemployment, because their unemployment's run out, and they're not asking for any more, and they're not going out looking for more jobs.
[00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:05.407]  They're just kind of falling into this pit of despair.
[00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:10.169]  And another signpost on that is this article out of the Associated Press.
[00:09:10.589 --> 00:09:13.992]  Number of homeless children in America surges to an all-time high.
[00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:19.836]  A report estimated 2.5 million children have been homeless at some point in 2013.
[00:09:20.617 --> 00:09:21.918]  The number of homeless children in the U.S.
[00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:36.770]  has surged in recent years to an all-time high, amounting to one child in every 30, according to a comprehensive state-by-state report that blames the nation's high poverty rate, the lack of affordable housing, and the impacts of pervasive domestic violence.
[00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:42.305]  You also have the over 50 million families that are on food stamps.
[00:09:42.846 --> 00:09:49.568]  You have most families that are living paycheck to paycheck, meaning if they get sick or if anything happens to them, they're going to be out on the street.
[00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:53.069]  We are teetering on the edge of an economic collapse.
[00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:55.049]  And what is the solution?
[00:09:55.089 --> 00:10:03.872]  Well, the solution is to go after the people that actually did this, that actually caused the economy to go into this downward spiral, the too-big-to-fails that we're afraid to go after.
[00:10:04.352 --> 00:10:08.713]  And our guest coming up is going to talk a little bit about that and why they're unable to go after him.
[00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.953]  But here is a solution.
[00:10:09.973 --> 00:10:15.874]  It's a quick article out of National Business, and this is from Iceland.
[00:10:15.954 --> 00:10:20.695]  Sincerely, the banker's name is Sincerely, sentenced to 12 months of imprisonment.
[00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:22.256]  Sincerely, T.H.
[00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:28.577]  Arnson, former CEO of Lebanski, was sentenced to 12 months in prison by the District Court of Reykjavik today.
[00:10:28.957 --> 00:10:30.157]  So this is what we have to do.
[00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:33.278]  We have to put the bankers in prison when they steal from us.
[00:10:33.658 --> 00:10:37.740]  When they rob us blind, when they launder drug money, they have to go to jail.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.221]  That's the only solution to this.
[00:10:39.581 --> 00:10:42.003]  And I want to end this segment on a bit of a positive note.
[00:10:42.063 --> 00:10:45.225]  Alex Jones filed this report today up on our YouTube channel.
[00:10:45.285 --> 00:10:47.606]  It's titled Universe of Incredible Wonder.
[00:10:47.866 --> 00:10:51.809]  So we're going to go to this report as we go to break and then we'll be back with a couple more special reports.
[00:10:52.189 --> 00:11:02.315]  And then we've got an interview with CIA analyst Ray McGovern talking about FBI surveillance and how it relates to you out there and how the system is now finally starting to eat its own under this big bureaucratic weight.
[00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:12.857]  Well, you're only alive once, and we live in a universe of incredible wonder.
[00:11:13.617 --> 00:11:14.598]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:25.140]  And all I'm trying to get people to do is to realize that there is an anti-human agenda to shutter our windows of perception, of consciousness.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.841]  There is a conscious, public,
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:36.282]  It's a global program to dumb you down and to try to limit the capacity and success of humans.
[00:11:38.002 --> 00:11:43.924]  And the corporate interests that are monopoly men are manipulating all the major political parties of the planet right now.
[00:11:45.224 --> 00:11:53.126]  And they are using the fact that we're individuals to atomize us so that we can't come together around basic tenets of human liberty and defeat them.
[00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:58.828]  But there is a human will, a human group consciousness that is aware of this
[00:11:59.898 --> 00:12:09.982]  And there's a huge awakening, 10,000 times bigger and more real than something like Fight Club, that is cultural in nature, not violent, that will bring them down.
[00:12:10.242 --> 00:12:17.824]  So just tonight, look at that beautiful spotlight up there into the universe and just think about all the amazing things that are out there.
[00:12:17.844 --> 00:12:23.567]  And realize that you're not junk, you're not crap, and the globalists don't control you and your life.
[00:12:24.087 --> 00:12:25.087]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:12:25.427 --> 00:12:27.188]  I want all of you to think about that after tonight.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.304]  I know what I'm saying is just basic information but think about it.
[00:12:33.024 --> 00:12:34.666]  Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com

[00:13:13.621 --> 00:13:19.922]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:13:20.282 --> 00:13:21.763]  I believe our research is conclusive.

[00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:48.823]  You know, you haven't heard much Ebola news in the news lately, and that's either due to two things.
[00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:50.966]  Either there's no more Ebola cases...
[00:13:52.049 --> 00:13:55.932]  Or they're hiding the fact that there are Ebola cases to keep people from panicking.
[00:13:56.393 --> 00:13:57.533]  We got a case in point here.
[00:13:57.553 --> 00:13:59.475]  This is from Paul Joseph Watson today.
[00:14:00.416 --> 00:14:03.498]  A New York City woman on Ebola watch list dies bleeding from mouth.
[00:14:03.658 --> 00:14:05.800]  Authorities say heart attack.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.381]  Happens all the time.
[00:14:07.401 --> 00:14:17.009]  A woman who returned from Guinea 18 days ago and was on the Ebola monitoring list dropped dead in a Brooklyn hair salon yesterday after eyewitnesses said she began bleeding from the mouth and nose.
[00:14:17.529 --> 00:14:20.612]  But authorities later asserted that the cause of death was an apparent heart attack.
[00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:33.948]  FDNY activated the special operations and hazmat units after the woman who had traveled to Guinea three weeks ago, according to a source on the scene, died at Amy Professional African Hair Braiding in the Brownsville area, Brooklyn, reports the Daily Mail.
[00:14:34.468 --> 00:14:43.272]  Despite eyewitnesses reporting there was blood coming from the woman's face, nose and mouth, health authorities claim that she had not displayed any Ebola symptoms and in fact had died of a heart attack.
[00:14:43.392 --> 00:14:47.474]  The woman, who is in her 40s, is being tested for Ebola and the results will be announced later today.
[00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:48.694]  We're good to go.
[00:15:12.236 --> 00:15:13.697]  Who knows what's going on with Ebola.
[00:15:13.758 --> 00:15:14.638]  We're going to find out soon.
[00:15:14.678 --> 00:15:21.745]  I will tell you this, I've been getting a lot of emails on the whistleblower hotline of people saying they're bringing people in, they think it's Ebola, they're keeping it hush-hush.
[00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:27.351]  I'll call some of these hospitals, the PR people, administrators go, oh no, we didn't bring anybody in.
[00:15:27.871 --> 00:15:30.534]  And then I'll call the source and say, hey, they said they didn't bring anybody in.
[00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:33.457]  They're like, no, they're at this door and this is the code name they're giving them.
[00:15:34.037 --> 00:15:36.700]  And then I'll call the person back and I don't get any calls back after that.
[00:15:37.355 --> 00:15:38.375]  So it's really weird.
[00:15:38.595 --> 00:15:40.316]  I don't know how many cases they are hiding.
[00:15:40.336 --> 00:15:41.216]  I'm sure they're hiding a lot.
[00:15:41.256 --> 00:15:45.798]  We've had reports from doctors of them whisking patients away.
[00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.439]  We've had reports down at the border, they're whisking people away.
[00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:52.760]  We've had reports of people coming from Africa, crossing over illegally.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:16:00.003]  Who knows what is really going on because we aren't getting the truth from the mainstream media as we showed you earlier from that Washington Post article.
[00:16:00.503 --> 00:16:03.584]  But let's go on to this, this totally ridiculous bit of news.
[00:16:04.484 --> 00:16:05.645]  This is from Steve Watson.
[00:16:06.305 --> 00:16:09.866]  10-year-old suspended for pointing imaginary ray guns.
[00:16:09.946 --> 00:16:12.107]  It wasn't even a real ray gun, it was just imaginary.
[00:16:13.188 --> 00:16:21.831]  In a now all too familiar scenario, a fifth grader has been suspended in Massachusetts, of course, after pointing an imaginary ray gun and saying, POW!
[00:16:23.038 --> 00:16:29.726]  Ten-year-old Nicholas Taylor was suspended for two days by officials at Stacy Middle School in Milford following an incident which took place in the cafeteria.
[00:16:30.186 --> 00:16:42.901]  Nicholas, who has no history of bad behavior, is said to have cut in line in the lunch queue and mouthed laser sounds coming from an imaginary ray gun otherwise identified as his own finger pointed at the other students in line.
[00:16:43.905 --> 00:16:49.370]  Nicholas told reporters that he was not pointing the weapon at any other students, but he was simply amusing himself.
[00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.872]  How dare he do that?
[00:16:52.973 --> 00:16:53.933]  Poor Nicholas.
[00:16:55.975 --> 00:16:58.077]  I mean, it just shows you how out of control it's gotten.
[00:16:58.894 --> 00:16:59.194]  Okay.
[00:16:59.694 --> 00:17:06.237]  We're going to let people walk through possible Ebola messes in hair salons, but somebody does this and goes, meow, meow, meow.
[00:17:06.537 --> 00:17:07.918]  We're going to suspend them from school?
[00:17:08.458 --> 00:17:08.858]  What is that?
[00:17:08.918 --> 00:17:09.839]  Teaching our kids?
[00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:10.679]  You have to ask yourself.
[00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:12.060]  Well, it's teaching them to be slaves.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.541]  It's teaching them to line up and be subservient to authority.
[00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:16.642]  I want to go to this oldie but goodie.
[00:17:16.882 --> 00:17:20.523]  This is a report we put out on January 25, 2013, titled, Alex Jones Goes on Arm Rampage.
[00:17:24.705 --> 00:17:26.106]  With Bubble Gun!
[00:17:26.366 --> 00:17:28.567]  Oh my gosh, this is an oldie but goodie that we produced.
[00:17:28.587 --> 00:17:31.909]  We'll be right back after this with an interview from Ray McGovern.
[00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.211]  It's the Info Wars Nightly News and I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:37.832]  You rolling?
[00:17:38.052 --> 00:17:38.212]  Yep.
[00:17:38.692 --> 00:17:41.033]  Okay, I want to thank everybody for coming here for the staff meeting.
[00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:42.534]  Alex will be joining us in just a few minutes.
[00:17:42.554 --> 00:17:46.135]  I'd like to thank my new assistant, Rob Duke, who has been demoted for this purpose.
[00:17:46.556 --> 00:17:50.417]  Now, I have a few stories I'd like to go over, but first, Darren McBrain, what do you have there?
[00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:58.200]  Well, it's kind of interesting that the Chinese government recommends that our government starts confiscating... Hold on, hold on, I'm sorry I'm late!
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.241]  Look at this!
[00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:01.981]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Alex!
[00:18:02.062 --> 00:18:02.862]  Check it out, man!
[00:18:03.402 --> 00:18:07.406]  We've got that office party and, you know, I gave presents to all the kids at the Christmas party.
[00:18:07.446 --> 00:18:08.607]  I think that office party's coming up.
[00:18:08.747 --> 00:18:11.249]  I'm thinking we'll have these as party favors.
[00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:12.070]  Check this out.
[00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.091]  Alex, Alex, Alex.
[00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:15.233]  You guys acting weird for me.
[00:18:15.253 --> 00:18:17.495]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:18:17.735 --> 00:18:18.696]  Alex, I have this article.
[00:18:18.716 --> 00:18:19.536]  That's a bubble gun.
[00:18:19.997 --> 00:18:24.861]  A five-year-old girl was suspended after a terroristic threat when she brought a pink bubble gun.
[00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:25.442]  Just like that.
[00:18:27.011 --> 00:18:28.232]  What is this, a prank or something?
[00:18:28.252 --> 00:18:29.654]  We're supposed to be having a meeting.
[00:18:29.674 --> 00:18:30.155]  That's a bubble gun!
[00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:31.316]  You can't have that stuff, Alex.
[00:18:31.336 --> 00:18:31.716]  You can't.
[00:18:31.737 --> 00:18:32.798]  Is that a smoothie?
[00:18:32.818 --> 00:18:34.680]  You can't bring that around, Alex.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.922]  That is a fully automatic bubble gun.
[00:18:37.765 --> 00:18:39.005]  Listen, Jakari, I know you're joking.
[00:18:39.025 --> 00:18:39.845]  There's no story.
[00:18:39.865 --> 00:18:40.686]  Alright, look, Alex.
[00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:41.546]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:18:41.726 --> 00:18:42.666]  Let me talk to Melissa.
[00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:43.426]  Melissa, what's going on?
[00:18:43.446 --> 00:18:44.246]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:44.846]  That's a bubble gun.
[00:18:44.866 --> 00:18:48.867]  They almost arrested an elementary school girl last week for having a paper gun at school.
[00:18:48.887 --> 00:18:51.007]  That's, that's, that's... But what is this about a bubble gun?
[00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:51.928]  The Hamilkitty thing?
[00:18:52.128 --> 00:18:52.408]  Yes.
[00:18:52.668 --> 00:18:53.568]  I thought that was a joke.
[00:18:53.668 --> 00:18:54.348]  It's not a joke.
[00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:55.688]  This is not a joke!
[00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:56.708]  Alex Jones!
[00:18:56.888 --> 00:18:57.789]  Terroristic threat.
[00:18:58.109 --> 00:19:00.029]  Alex, I'm not going to be subjected to this.
[00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:01.029]  It's a detergent.
[00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:01.869]  Guys, come on.
[00:19:01.929 --> 00:19:02.930]  It's a bubble gun.
[00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.010]  If that detergent gets in my eye, I'm in.
[00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.071]  That's assault!
[00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:06.871]  That's assault!
[00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:07.311]  That's assault!
[00:19:07.672 --> 00:19:08.592]  It doesn't matter.
[00:19:08.612 --> 00:19:09.133]  It doesn't matter.
[00:19:09.173 --> 00:19:11.715]  The government says it's bad, Alex.
[00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:13.276]  Well, then talk some sense to them.
[00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:15.858]  No, you should see what they're saying.
[00:19:15.998 --> 00:19:17.939]  Okay, well, what party favors can I have then?
[00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:20.401]  Look, it's Bubbles, guys!
[00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:23.683]  Alright, alright, alright, everybody stay calm.
[00:19:23.723 --> 00:19:24.944]  David, talk sense to him.
[00:19:25.024 --> 00:19:26.325]  What the hell is going on?
[00:19:26.345 --> 00:19:27.026]  Stop this.
[00:19:27.086 --> 00:19:28.347]  No, he's getting too loud.
[00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:29.808]  What the hell?
[00:19:29.828 --> 00:19:30.589]  Somebody call... 911! 911!
[00:19:33.951 --> 00:19:34.571]  9-1-1!
[00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.032]  9-1-1!
[00:19:35.672 --> 00:19:41.856]  I'm being held hostage by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist.
[00:19:41.896 --> 00:19:42.717]  It's a bubblegum!
[00:19:43.437 --> 00:19:45.979]  NBC says we should never... It's a bubblegum!
[00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:48.320]  Alex Jones... Turn that off!
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.501]  Turn that off, man!
[00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:50.202]  Turn that off!
[00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:58.838]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:19:58.938 --> 00:20:01.100]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:06.506]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:11.752]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:20:11.892 --> 00:20:14.993]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:20:15.273 --> 00:20:19.194]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:20:19.394 --> 00:20:23.716]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:20:23.796 --> 00:20:33.899]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:20:34.139 --> 00:20:45.067]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:20:45.227 --> 00:20:49.230]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:20:51.872 --> 00:20:53.114]  Another major health threat.
[00:20:53.134 --> 00:20:58.020]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.743]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:21:00.783 --> 00:21:07.572]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:21:07.832 --> 00:21:10.656]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:21:10.816 --> 00:21:13.718]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:21:13.738 --> 00:21:15.760]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.702]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:21:18.722 --> 00:21:24.226]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:21:24.426 --> 00:21:27.909]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:30.951]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:38.137]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:41.400]  An emergency.

[00:21:58.254 --> 00:21:58.774]  Welcome back.
[00:21:59.195 --> 00:22:01.936]  Our next guest was a CIA analyst for over 27 years.
[00:22:02.257 --> 00:22:10.122]  He joins us now to talk about FBI surveillance, among other agencies also surveilling us, and what's going on with Martin Luther King, and we're even going to get into Russia and ISIS.
[00:22:10.322 --> 00:22:17.946]  Joining us now is Ray McGovern, ex-CIA analyst, and we're going to talk about FBI surveillance and a whole host of agencies.
[00:22:18.047 --> 00:22:23.750]  Ray, it's just come out in the New York Times that there's at least 40 agencies conducting undercover operations.
[00:22:25.231 --> 00:22:30.714]  How much have you had to deal with this at your time in the CIA and then even since you've been out of the CIA?
[00:22:30.774 --> 00:22:33.136]  What have been your run-ins with these undercover operations?
[00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:36.082]  Well, this is a growth industry, of course.
[00:22:36.683 --> 00:22:50.453]  Never has there been so much money around, and these people need something to do, and so they end up monitoring and intrusively surveilling people like the Catholic Worker, the Quakers, the Thomas Merton Center in Pittsburgh.
[00:22:50.913 --> 00:22:56.998]  It's reached ridiculous lengths, and a lot of this stuff has to do with entrapment.
[00:22:57.258 --> 00:23:02.442]  A lot of it has to do with monitoring things that really should be private.
[00:23:03.444 --> 00:23:04.305]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:23:04.345 --> 00:23:07.808]  And we've seen with the Amish even, just trying to sell raw milk.
[00:23:07.848 --> 00:23:13.794]  They've been the target of stings, FBI stings, where they've gone in and taken people's farms just for selling milk.
[00:23:14.514 --> 00:23:27.266]  But getting into this letter that came out also from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the suicide letter that the FBI actually wrote to Martin Luther King detailing a bunch of things that they said they had tape of him on.
[00:23:27.987 --> 00:23:33.911]  And it just really shows to the great lengths that they go to to put people under that threaten the system as it is.
[00:23:34.171 --> 00:23:35.272]  What's your experience with this?
[00:23:36.532 --> 00:23:45.178]  Well, my experience, of course, goes back to decades ago when J. Edgar Hoover was running roughshod over everyone.
[00:23:46.278 --> 00:23:49.600]  One of the questions here, of course, is Bobby Kennedy.
[00:23:50.201 --> 00:23:57.145]  Bobby Kennedy approving the intrusive surveillance, the wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr.? ?
[00:23:58.579 --> 00:24:11.829]  I asked my friend Colleen Rowley about that, and she said, Ray, they were not only eavesdropping on Martin Luther King Jr., they were eavesdropping on the Kennedy brothers.
[00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:18.214]  They knew exactly what the Kennedy brothers were doing with those nice little girls in the pool there in the White House.
[00:24:18.434 --> 00:24:24.299]  And Marilyn Monroe, they actually have detailed accounts of them visiting Marilyn Monroe, both of the brothers even in the same night.
[00:24:24.659 --> 00:24:24.899]  Right.
[00:24:24.979 --> 00:24:28.002]  So the name is blackmail, pure and simple.
[00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:44.747]  And the irony here is that Frank Church warns specifically about that, and that's specifically why there is a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act dated 1978, which of course has been pretty much revoked by
[00:24:46.028 --> 00:24:53.751]  By current legislation, the current legislation being in gross violation of the Fourth Amendment of our Constitution.
[00:24:54.552 --> 00:25:01.394]  As Colleen explains to me, it just takes the judiciary several years to catch up with these illegal laws.
[00:25:01.595 --> 00:25:02.335]  Illegal laws?
[00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:02.675]  Yes.
[00:25:02.795 --> 00:25:04.316]  It's not an oxymoron.
[00:25:04.676 --> 00:25:07.397]  They are illegal if they're unconstitutional.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.161]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:25:09.721 --> 00:25:17.627]  Now, you were also a victim of being arrested for going after Petraeus, who was also a victim of this illegal surveillance.
[00:25:17.648 --> 00:25:22.291]  Let's get into Petraeus a little bit and detail how the system, you know, they eat their own, essentially.
[00:25:22.952 --> 00:25:23.452]  They do.
[00:25:24.093 --> 00:25:31.298]  You know, the supreme irony, I was surveilled and so they knew I was coming to just see Petraeus.
[00:25:31.338 --> 00:25:34.541]  I might ask a question, as I did Rumsfeld several years ago.
[00:25:35.673 --> 00:25:41.477]  But then I got to thinking, well, you know, the supreme irony is that Petraeus himself was done in.
[00:25:42.478 --> 00:25:43.399]  Why was he done in?
[00:25:44.339 --> 00:25:46.521]  Because he became too big for his britches.
[00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:50.143]  And I don't just mean, you know, Paul, a Broadwell affair.
[00:25:50.604 --> 00:26:01.952]  I mean, as far as the White House was concerned, he was so crassly ambitious and ready to seize the Republican nomination one time removed here.
[00:26:02.692 --> 00:26:03.814]  That they wanted to get rid of him.
[00:26:04.074 --> 00:26:17.189]  And so on the day after election day, when Obama was re-elected, they presented him with the results of looking through all his emails to Broadwell and others.
[00:26:17.289 --> 00:26:19.732]  Now, Petraeus, of course, thought he had deleted them.
[00:26:20.447 --> 00:26:21.348]  But not so.
[00:26:21.988 --> 00:26:33.238]  General Alexander from NSA and Bob Mueller from the FBI did the dirty work for the White House and laid it out in front of his face and said, now you have to resign.
[00:26:34.002 --> 00:26:43.927]  And so, you know, when people say, I have nothing to fear, well, even four-star generals have a lot to fear, and people should be aware of that.
[00:26:44.368 --> 00:26:51.051]  The other thing I'll mention here, because it's terribly important to me, we had a fellow named Eliot Spitzer.
[00:26:51.791 --> 00:27:00.136]  Now, he was governor of New York, and he also was going after the Wall Street firms who were clearly ripping us off right and left.
[00:27:00.876 --> 00:27:01.817]  Now, what happened to him?
[00:27:02.258 --> 00:27:04.861]  Well, the eavesdropped on him.
[00:27:05.402 --> 00:27:10.988]  Same guys, Alexander from NSA, Bob Mueller from the FBI, and they got him, right?
[00:27:11.409 --> 00:27:12.190]  They got him good.
[00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.876]  Now, where are Alexander and Mueller working now?
[00:27:17.797 --> 00:27:19.479]  They're working for Wall Street!
[00:27:19.997 --> 00:27:29.180]  They have a wonderful, a wonderful cyber defense firm for which Alexander alone is making a million dollars a month.
[00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:33.662]  And so you talk about the appearance of conflict of interest.
[00:27:34.242 --> 00:27:35.123]  Forget appearance.
[00:27:35.663 --> 00:27:38.144]  These guys did the bidding of Wall Street.
[00:27:38.304 --> 00:27:39.784]  They did the bidding of the White House.
[00:27:40.205 --> 00:27:46.227]  They're out of government now and they're making it big with Wall Street by having this pretend
[00:27:46.947 --> 00:27:50.411]  A cybersecurity firm, which is bringing in lots of bucks.
[00:27:51.212 --> 00:28:08.209]  I don't know what you do with your second million dollars, but they certainly know what they're doing and they have multiple million dollars by virtue of services performed while in the government and getting Eliot Spitzer, who is about to nail Wall Street big time.
[00:28:08.806 --> 00:28:15.268]  And who knows what else they have, money or otherwise information, because you know how this revolving door works.
[00:28:15.368 --> 00:28:17.989]  Once you leave Washington, you still have your ties in there.
[00:28:18.429 --> 00:28:22.110]  And it also reminds me, you know, Petraeus said he thought he deleted the emails.
[00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:28.472]  Well, all those celebrities out there thought they deleted those naked pictures off their phones, but the cloud doesn't delete anything.
[00:28:28.652 --> 00:28:33.416]  And this is something that I think people aren't aware of, this cloud computing system that's been set up.
[00:28:33.777 --> 00:28:35.858]  It's basically there to gather all your information.
[00:28:35.898 --> 00:28:37.180]  It's not there to save it for you.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.302]  It's there to collect it so they can put algorithms on you.
[00:28:40.863 --> 00:28:48.690]  Sure, and it's in gross violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that's the important... You know, for people who say, I've got nothing to hide, you know?
[00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:54.595]  Well, after Ed Snowden revealed the first tranche of his documents,
[00:28:55.367 --> 00:29:11.000]  They asked an old Stasi, the Stasi being the East German Security Service, those who have seen The Lives of Others, that wonderful film, Das Leben der Anderen, know how intrusive those Stasi fellows were with their earphones and so forth.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:21.448]  Well, Wolfgang Schmidt, who was a lieutenant colonel in the Stasi, was asked, what do you think about people who say, I have nothing to hide?
[00:29:22.209 --> 00:29:23.050]  And here's what he said.
[00:29:24.238 --> 00:29:30.219]  This is incredibly naive to say the government will not use this against you.
[00:29:30.239 --> 00:29:34.380]  This is why they collect the information in the first place.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:42.762]  The only way to prevent it from being used against it is to prevent it from being collected in the first place.
[00:29:43.182 --> 00:29:44.623]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:46.243]  And he knows what he's talking about.
[00:29:46.343 --> 00:29:47.003]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:29:47.203 --> 00:29:49.964]  And back then, they were still in an analog world.
[00:29:50.004 --> 00:29:55.486]  They had not yet crossed over into this digital realm where storage and surveillance and cameras and everything.
[00:29:55.506 --> 00:29:59.387]  I mean, we're walking around with our own surveillance pagers, essentially, for the government.
[00:29:59.827 --> 00:30:02.288]  Our iPhones, our Androids, whatever.
[00:30:02.608 --> 00:30:04.789]  They really are probe droids.
[00:30:04.929 --> 00:30:09.972]  Imperial probe droids gathering information so they can, A, come after us anytime they feel like it.
[00:30:10.052 --> 00:30:17.657]  Anytime we become expendable or become a threat to the system, they can either A, plant stuff on us, or B, say, well, we didn't like where you went over here.
[00:30:17.937 --> 00:30:19.458]  We didn't like this transaction that you did.
[00:30:19.478 --> 00:30:21.780]  We're just going to bring you in for questioning and confiscate your property.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.740]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.321]  You've got to prove you're innocent.
[00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:26.783]  That's the state of the world that we're living in today.
[00:30:26.803 --> 00:30:28.324]  Do you share that assessment?
[00:30:29.209 --> 00:30:30.010]  Well, yeah.
[00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:44.648]  You know, the best chance to prevent this was a bill that was just defeated in Congress last night with a predominant Republican majority saying, no, you can't fix this system.
[00:30:44.728 --> 00:30:47.171]  We want this mass surveillance.
[00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:47.511]  Why?
[00:30:48.331 --> 00:30:49.031]  You know why.
[00:30:49.051 --> 00:30:50.512]  They want to use it.
[00:30:50.572 --> 00:30:53.414]  No, what they say is it's against terrorists.
[00:30:53.514 --> 00:30:54.695]  Oh, yeah, yeah, right.
[00:30:55.055 --> 00:30:56.136]  It's against you and me.
[00:30:56.216 --> 00:30:57.636]  Right, we're the terrorists.
[00:30:58.057 --> 00:30:59.978]  It's against the Spitzer.
[00:31:00.398 --> 00:31:07.302]  So, you know, the reality is such that Frank Church had it right, that this is an incredibly powerful tool.
[00:31:08.022 --> 00:31:13.726]  And in the hands of the wrong people, and there will always be wrong people around, it's a tool for tyranny.
[00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:15.287]  We ought to face up to it.
[00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:16.948]  We ought to put a stop to it.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:18.600]  Well said.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.401]  What's on your website right now?
[00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:21.461]  What are you writing about?
[00:31:21.501 --> 00:31:22.561]  What are you most concerned about?
[00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:26.883]  Well, gosh, I've been writing a lot about Ukraine.
[00:31:29.184 --> 00:31:32.445]  A lot about, well, NSA.
[00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:38.287]  Whenever I'm interviewed, usually my son puts that up on the website.
[00:31:38.807 --> 00:31:43.348]  There are a lot of issues that, well, ISIL, ISIS is another, you know.
[00:31:46.018 --> 00:31:58.506]  When the report came out from Patrick Coburn, who knows more about the Middle East than anybody in the White House, when he said that he was told that there were 200,000 ISIL, OK?
[00:31:59.086 --> 00:32:07.351]  Well, maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but it's much closer to the 15,000 that the CIA and the Army is saying.
[00:32:07.532 --> 00:32:08.732]  So what am I saying here?
[00:32:09.153 --> 00:32:12.194]  I'm saying it's a similar situation to Vietnam.
[00:32:12.535 --> 00:32:14.336]  And when you're as old as I am, you remember.
[00:32:14.836 --> 00:32:14.936]  Okay.
[00:32:36.082 --> 00:32:42.666]  500,000 communists under arms attacked every city, hamlet, and provincial town in South Vietnam.
[00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:52.833]  And they did it not with 200,000 or 299,000, which was the cap that Westmoreland put on how many enemies there could be, okay?
[00:32:53.333 --> 00:32:57.936]  The VC, the Viet Cong didn't agree that there could only be 299,000.
[00:32:59.256 --> 00:33:00.797]  So they hit us big.
[00:33:00.998 --> 00:33:02.839]  Now, what's the significance of that?
[00:33:03.719 --> 00:33:07.583]  If we knew that, if the American people knew that, that was halfway through the war, right?
[00:33:08.464 --> 00:33:23.120]  Now if we stopped that war, that whole left, it's the western wing of the V that forms the Vietnam Memorial, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, it wouldn't be there because there'd be no names to inscribe in that granite.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.761]  That's how serious that was.
[00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:25.322]  We're talking 25
[00:33:26.663 --> 00:33:30.305]  30,000 people more dead when we could have stopped that war.
[00:33:30.605 --> 00:33:31.785]  What are we doing with ISIL?
[00:33:32.085 --> 00:33:33.646]  Well, now there are only 3,000.
[00:33:33.706 --> 00:33:34.867]  Maybe there's 6,000.
[00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:37.088]  The president doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:33:37.408 --> 00:33:38.848]  He's got very bad advice.
[00:33:39.128 --> 00:33:47.472]  Even some of the generals are hesitating now and saying, you know, this is a fool's errand, just like Afghanistan, just like Iraq.
[00:33:47.772 --> 00:33:48.772]  Now we're going to do it again?
[00:33:49.313 --> 00:33:49.913]  Give me a break.
[00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:51.916]  And now it's going to be on several fronts.
[00:33:51.956 --> 00:33:55.417]  It'll be in Syria, it'll be again in Iraq, maybe even go into Turkey.
[00:33:55.837 --> 00:33:57.698]  I mean, this thing is just looking bad all over.
[00:33:57.718 --> 00:34:01.560]  So you think we're just at the beginning of what we're seeing in fighting with ISIL.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.320]  You think it's going to be boots on the ground?
[00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:06.482]  Well, there are already boots on the ground.
[00:34:07.222 --> 00:34:16.766]  Whether there'll be a big reinforcement, certainly General Dempsey believes that that's going to be necessary if we're going to prevail, whatever that means.
[00:34:17.286 --> 00:34:18.607]  People are talking 30 years.
[00:34:19.915 --> 00:34:22.678]  You know, they referred to the 30 Years War.
[00:34:22.718 --> 00:34:25.321]  Well, we've been there, done that.
[00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:30.927]  That's what happened in Europe when finally they decided, you know, it doesn't make a lot of sense to go killing each other.
[00:34:31.288 --> 00:34:39.317]  And they had the Treaty of Westphalia, 1648, I think it was, where they agreed there would be international boundaries and they would be respected.
[00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.509]  Thank you.
[00:34:56.338 --> 00:35:00.742]  It only prevailed until 9-11 when... So you have a false flag.
[00:35:01.062 --> 00:35:01.223]  Right.
[00:35:01.263 --> 00:35:03.024]  Yeah, you got the perfect reason to go after them.
[00:35:03.044 --> 00:35:07.308]  You just, you know, create the enemy, you fund them, and then when they attack you, you go, oh my goodness.
[00:35:07.928 --> 00:35:13.794]  Well, good thing we have this giant army ready to go after you guys, you know, and then send them in.
[00:35:13.874 --> 00:35:19.358]  The arms manufacturers and the arms peddlers, they're making it big time out of all this.
[00:35:19.899 --> 00:35:21.961]  When you look at what happened earlier this year,
[00:35:23.059 --> 00:35:31.701]  Now look at the well-trained, the well-equipped and wonderful army that Petraeus had trained, right?
[00:35:31.841 --> 00:35:33.001]  Four divisions of them.
[00:35:33.121 --> 00:35:35.302]  They're up in northern Iraq and what happens?
[00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:39.243]  ISIL takes a couple of AK-47s and shoots it their way.
[00:35:39.563 --> 00:35:40.343]  They run away!
[00:35:40.823 --> 00:35:41.903]  I don't want to exaggerate.
[00:35:42.624 --> 00:35:43.624]  They didn't all run away.
[00:35:45.154 --> 00:35:48.259]  The Commissioned Officers took helicopters away.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.883]  And they left all the equipment for them to grab.
[00:35:52.145 --> 00:35:55.770]  My point is, they left their heavy tanks, they left their
[00:35:56.585 --> 00:35:56.805]  Exactly.
[00:35:56.845 --> 00:35:58.967]  I mean, is this a great country or what?
[00:35:58.987 --> 00:36:00.087]  It's an evil cycle.
[00:36:00.107 --> 00:36:05.731]  Hey, Ray, thanks for giving us an update on all those subjects, and where can people find out more about your work?
[00:36:06.071 --> 00:36:07.833]  RayMcGovern.com is the easiest way.
