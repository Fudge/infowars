[00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:21.309]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.231]  It is Tuesday, June 10th, 2014, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:26.492]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:29.453]  Tonight.
[00:00:30.373 --> 00:00:33.215]  Where does the responsibility lie with the Alex Joneses of the world?
[00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:39.118]  The zealotry of the far, far right fringe, and Alex Jones is unbowed.
[00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:40.098]  That's right, witch!
[00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:47.222]  I don't believe no certified liars that say the Klan founded the NRA when it's the opposite.
[00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:49.800]  I've heard that come out of your fat mouth.
[00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:57.233]  This show is scary because we're a mirror for MSNBC and Media Matters and the White House to look at who you are.
[00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:05.354]  Well, we knew that the Vegas cop killers would be exploited to go ahead and jumpstart the right-wing extremist meme.
[00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:11.816]  Well, right on time, CNN has now said that the Liberty Movement is more of a threat than Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:13.877]  Now, this is coming from Peter Bergen.
[00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:16.318]  He's CNN's national security analyst.
[00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:22.580]  He writes that the attack in Vegas is far from the only incident of violence by the American far-right.
[00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.982]  According to data collected by the New America Foundation,
[00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:31.625]  Right-wing extremists have killed 37 people in 16 violent incidents in the U.S.
[00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:32.886]  since 9-11.
[00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:40.890]  That number is more than the 21 people killed by militants motivated by Al-Qaeda's ideology in the post-9-11 era.
[00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:49.555]  Now, CNN is basically in no uncertain terms insisting that right-wing extremism is a threat more lethal than Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:56.180]  Pointing out that the New American Foundation is a think tank that's lorded over by Eric Schmidt of Google.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.523]  It's funded by George Soros and the State Department.
[00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:05.587]  But basically what's actually happening here is a concentrated effort to demonize criminal opponents.
[00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:10.811]  Now we reported, you know, the standoff with Cliven Bundy, that that was a small victory.
[00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:13.193]  They didn't, definitely did not win the war.
[00:02:13.273 --> 00:02:15.655]  And of course the establishment is never going to
[00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:16.676]  All right.
[00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:40.504]  They're using this situation with a deranged cop killer, cop killers, to demonize the entire patriot movement and liberty movement.
[00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:49.750]  But others are now pointing to the fact that this guy, Jared Miller, was conveniently interviewed by NBC and Al Jazeera.
[00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.312]  While he was at the Bundy Ranch.
[00:02:52.412 --> 00:03:02.400]  Now, all of this was prior to this weekend's shooting, of course, and they're saying that maybe this is proof of some sort of staged event or that he was an agent provocateur.
[00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.922]  Here's how that interview ran then.
[00:03:04.942 --> 00:03:11.247]  I feel sorry for any federal agents that want to come in here and try to push us around or anything like that.
[00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:19.214]  I really don't want violence toward them, but if they're going to come bring violence to us, well, if that's the language they want to speak, we'll learn it.
[00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:26.244]  Now I remember seeing that clip when it aired and I thought of course the mainstream media would use that particular part of the interview.
[00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:33.527]  It's very menacing and it fits the agenda that these people out there were dangerous and unhinged but that's exactly what I thought.
[00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.149]  This guy does not represent the Bundy supporters.
[00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:44.853]  He doesn't represent the whole movement that was there and he seemed a little unhinged or like an agent provocateur and indeed
[00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:46.533]  You know, that made me cringe.
[00:03:46.573 --> 00:03:50.895]  You didn't hear anyone out there at Bundy Ranch saying those same type of things.
[00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:57.237]  And he was actually, him and his girlfriend were kicked off of Bundy's ranch for having those kind of views.
[00:03:57.657 --> 00:04:13.842]  Now, the Daily Mail reports on Miller and his girlfriend's ouster from the ranch saying they were quoting Ammon Bundy who said, many of the Bundy supporters asked for Miller and his girlfriend to be ejected for being very radical and that they did not align themselves with the other protests.
[00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:17.368]  And Ammon said that not very many people were asked to leave.
[00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:19.993]  I think they may have been the only ones.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.142]  Agent provocateur type behavior.
[00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:31.527]  It's what we hear that they, you know, they were very radical, didn't align themselves with the actual protests that were going on.
[00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.990]  And that's the same sense that I got from the NBC interview.
[00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:46.179]  But it's interesting how the Daily Mail calls them out and says that they're white supremacists, which of course is not how the left-leaning liberal media here is only referring to them as these right-wing extremists.
[00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:48.480]  It's a different spin.
[00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:54.759]  But, you know, what we're hearing, the guy clearly was making a lot of Facebook posts.
[00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.803]  The girlfriend's family seems to think that she was somehow brainwashed by him believing these things.
[00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:05.708]  And his Facebook posts sort of point to this sort of unhinged rambling.
[00:05:05.748 --> 00:05:08.770]  You could tell that he really was wanting to start something.
[00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:17.558]  And it's interesting how the Daily Mail calls them white supremacists and not using the right-wing extremist meme that we are having here in the West.
[00:05:18.298 --> 00:05:20.899]  But clearly, you know, the guy was unstable.
[00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:33.322]  He appears to have brainwashed his wife, and he had some rambling posts on Facebook, and that's exactly what the establishment needed to demonize the Patriot movement.
[00:05:33.362 --> 00:05:34.142]  So, you know what?
[00:05:34.342 --> 00:05:34.782]  Who knows?
[00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:36.602]  Maybe they did have their eye on this guy.
[00:05:36.622 --> 00:05:43.104]  I'm sure he was on an FBI watch list for quite some time based on his Facebook posts that he's been making for years.
[00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:44.505]  So, who knows?
[00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:47.967]  I mean, they could have very well used him as an agent provocateur.
[00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:52.010]  Maybe that's why they interviewed him on NBC, to sort of have all of this.
[00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:53.932]  I mean, he was definitely on their radar.
[00:05:54.172 --> 00:05:57.894]  So, I'm not saying it was a false flag or staged event or anything, but...
[00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:01.778]  Frankly, if they're going to stage one, why not stage them all?
[00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:18.336]  Now, not only does this cop killer and his cop killer girlfriend justify their agenda to grab the guns, but they also justify the recommencement of the Justice Department bringing back their task force on domestic terrorism.
[00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.419]  Now, this is a task force that will be focused on
[00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:23.921]  Anti-government plots and racial violence.
[00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:26.342]  Which, what are they saying about Jared Miller?
[00:06:26.743 --> 00:06:29.464]  That he's anti-government and a white supremacist.
[00:06:29.544 --> 00:06:30.425]  So, bingo!
[00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:36.769]  Now, but it also justifies the need to militarize local police nationwide.
[00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.251]  In an article in the New York Times this week,
[00:06:39.991 --> 00:06:53.479]  He points out that police departments have received tens of thousands of machine guns, nearly 200,000 ammunition magazines, thousands of pieces of camouflage and night vision equipment, hundreds of silencers, armored cars and aircraft.
[00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.560]  Why?
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:03.425]  Well, a small-town Indiana sheriff breaks it down and defends this large-scale transference of military equipment, saying, the U.S.
[00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.086]  has become a war zone.
[00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:14.232]  Now, this particular county that the sheriff oversees, Pulaski County, is a farming community with just over 13,000 residents.
[00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:22.979]  In 2012, the county experienced only 11 incidents of theft, just 17 property crimes, and there was one murder.
[00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:30.885]  However, it is unlikely that a mine-resistant vehicle would have prevented it, and of course, it's not clear why they needed $5 million worth of
[00:07:32.426 --> 00:07:40.156]  Military equipment to police this town of 13,000 that it's apparently a war zone for this sheriff.
[00:07:40.616 --> 00:07:49.467]  Now writing on the department's website, Sheriff Geyer notes that with the threat of homeland terrorism, rising violence in our schools, drug and alcohol abuse,
[00:07:50.288 --> 00:07:54.772]  Our society and freedoms that we so dearly cherish are being challenged.
[00:07:55.233 --> 00:07:57.755]  Now, where have we heard that before?
[00:07:58.235 --> 00:08:02.299]  Our freedoms that we value and cherish, we hold them so dear, they're being challenged.
[00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:09.466]  So let's go ahead and turn the entire country into a militarized, full-time prison.
[00:08:10.506 --> 00:08:21.833]  But of course, now while they're spending all these resources to police apparent drug abusers and drunk people, the borders themselves are wide open.
[00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:24.775]  The floodgates have opened, they're being overrun.
[00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:35.741]  Now we received a letter from a Border Patrol agent who said that due to this flood of children across the borders, agents are too overwhelmed to stop the criminals.
[00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:36.301]  That's right.
[00:08:58.212 --> 00:09:06.223]  Immigrants are being rounded up and released in largely Hispanic populated South Texas towns such as Brownsville and McAllen.
[00:09:06.884 --> 00:09:10.148]  And he says because fewer people will notice or care.
[00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:15.295]  And he says that this has been going on for months before stories broke out a couple of weeks ago.
[00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:28.262]  So, you know, perhaps that's why we're seeing all this evidence of drug cartels being in Texas where they had mannequins hanging from billboards as a warning to either accept a bribe from the drug cartels or accept a bullet.
[00:09:29.143 --> 00:09:31.704]  So that's, you know, just evidence that this is happening.
[00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:35.646]  We are seeing more violence heading to our streets.
[00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:43.770]  President Obama has just opened up a third military base to deal with the flood of illegal child immigrants and family units.
[00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:56.754]  Senior administration officials who asked not to be identified told reporters that an army base at Fort Sill, Oklahoma will initially hold 600 unaccompanied minors and eventually up to 1,200.
[00:09:58.155 --> 00:10:08.338]  Now, Reuters previously reported that the administration was seeking about $2 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services to handle this influx.
[00:10:09.258 --> 00:10:10.259]  And this is, of course,
[00:10:11.099 --> 00:10:15.880]  More than double the $868 million that has been appropriated for this year.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.122]  So they're wanting more than a billion dollars more for fiscal year 2015.
[00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:33.485]  Now one week ago, the White House Director of Domestic Policy attributed the rapid run-up in illegal immigration by unaccompanied minors to growing violence in their countries.
[00:10:34.085 --> 00:10:50.357]  Which is of course understandable, and that is why my heart, and I'm sure a lot of your hearts, go out to these children, go out to these families, because they are trying to escape a very corrupt and violent country, and you know, seeking a better, safer life for their families and their children here in America.
[00:10:50.837 --> 00:10:53.178]  But what about all of these criminals that are also
[00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:54.420]  Crossing
[00:11:11.498 --> 00:11:17.541]  1.4 million gang members living in our cities and a substantial percentage of them are illegal immigrants.
[00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:24.645]  It's also been estimated that illegal immigrants now make up approximately 30% of the total prison population.
[00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:29.267]  And according to the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center,
[00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:34.328]  Mexican drug cartels were actively operating in just 50 different U.S.
[00:11:34.348 --> 00:11:40.569]  cities in 2006, but that number had skyrocketed to nearly 1,300 by 2010.
[00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:43.690]  So of course, that was four years ago.
[00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.590]  I'm sure it's even more now.
[00:11:47.091 --> 00:11:53.932]  And of course, in addition to all this increasing crime here in America, the cost to the taxpayer is going to be incalculable.
[00:11:54.312 --> 00:12:02.219]  But what did the White House think was going to happen when they're pushing so hard for amnesty and basically telling everyone, come on in and we'll take care of you?
[00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:07.623]  What did they think was going to happen that's going to create a spike in illegal immigration?
[00:12:08.284 --> 00:12:10.926]  And, you know, we've been warning about this for years.
[00:12:11.267 --> 00:12:17.212]  So now while people are, you know, politically observing, saying, is amnesty going to pass through Congress or not?
[00:12:17.632 --> 00:12:20.675]  Obama has already done de facto amnesty.
[00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:25.016]  Word has spread throughout Mexico, Central, South America.
[00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:27.858]  That's why the borders are now being overrun.
[00:12:28.378 --> 00:12:31.319]  So, what does this de facto amnesty look like?
[00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:44.864]  Well, we've got sanctuary cities, there is a federal government website that's set up that tells immigrants how to sign up for welfare, and it promises them that their immigration status will not be checked when they want to go get food stamps.
[00:12:45.944 --> 00:12:51.048]  But listen to what Central Americans and people who are flooding the borders illegally, listen to what they're saying.
[00:12:51.469 --> 00:12:58.594]  Central Americans say that news reports in their countries are encouraging them to make the journey north to the United States.
[00:12:59.034 --> 00:13:05.920]  A mother and child told Channel 5 News that the message being disseminated in their country is, go to America with your child.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.561]  You won't be turned away.
[00:13:08.001 --> 00:13:10.343]  Now this is of course in addition to the controversial
[00:13:10.803 --> 00:13:15.546]  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that started in 2012.
[00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:23.051]  This allowed many illegal immigrants who came to the US as minors to escape deportation for two years.
[00:13:23.391 --> 00:13:27.454]  The White House just gave them another two-year window last week.
[00:13:28.467 --> 00:13:36.213]  Now, of course, they're reporting that this has caused a 12-fold spike in illegal immigrant minors coming across the country.
[00:13:36.673 --> 00:13:39.415]  So forget about the fact that there's a lack of jobs.
[00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:46.961]  Forget about the fact that there are 57,000 veterans who are waiting for their first visit with a VA hospital.
[00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:51.044]  Forget about the fact that Veterans Affairs is in shambles.
[00:13:51.424 --> 00:13:57.609]  Forget about the fact that there are record numbers of American families now on food stamps and welfare.
[00:13:58.209 --> 00:13:59.890]  No, we don't need to take care of that.
[00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:06.494]  We'll just go ahead and spend our taxpayer dollars, $2 billion next year, to take care of illegal immigrants.
[00:14:07.034 --> 00:14:11.697]  And, you know, we've heard what a bureaucratic nightmare it is for legal immigration.
[00:14:11.837 --> 00:14:16.340]  So now they're just creating this backdoor, telling everyone to just come in illegally.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.482]  It's a lot easier and we'll just grant you amnesty.
[00:14:20.302 --> 00:14:22.684]  And basically the question is, what is this for?
[00:14:23.084 --> 00:14:30.690]  Is it to turn America into an actual war zone so that we can justify the need for the militarization of the police?
[00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:39.536]  Is it to invite people in who will vote to take away the guns and who will vote for bigger government to take care of them?
[00:14:40.137 --> 00:14:42.658]  It's quite obvious what is happening here.
[00:14:43.619 --> 00:14:52.843]  Now stick around because coming up we've got a very important interview that will basically break down how to break free of this matrix and wake up.
[00:14:53.283 --> 00:14:59.266]  And before that we've got a special report from Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs tallying up Obama's lies.
[00:14:59.626 --> 00:15:00.787]  That's coming up right after this.
[00:15:09.525 --> 00:15:15.108]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:15:15.308 --> 00:15:22.532]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:15:22.692 --> 00:15:25.914]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:15:26.054 --> 00:15:27.815]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:15:28.075 --> 00:15:32.637]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:15:32.737 --> 00:15:35.478]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:15:35.638 --> 00:15:41.421]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:45.082]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:15:45.282 --> 00:15:50.305]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:10.392]  A few weeks ago we made a video compilation about Jay Carney and all the lies.
[00:17:10.892 --> 00:17:13.454]  So I figured why not hear him from the man himself.
[00:17:13.814 --> 00:17:18.218]  This is a video of President Obama's broken promises and lies to the country.
[00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:19.119]  Enjoy.
[00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:23.102]  The way to make government responsible is to hold it accountable.
[00:17:23.971 --> 00:17:34.279]  And the way to make government accountable is make it transparent, so the American people can know exactly what decisions are being made, how they're being made, and whether their interests are being well-served.
[00:17:34.639 --> 00:17:37.081]  This is the most transparent administration in history.
[00:17:37.381 --> 00:17:41.044]  And we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states.
[00:17:41.305 --> 00:17:42.926]  We'll close Guantanamo.
[00:17:43.266 --> 00:17:48.989]  I am less interested in passing out blame than I am in learning from and correcting these mistakes to make us safer.
[00:17:49.289 --> 00:17:51.270]  For ultimately, the buck stops with me.
[00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.271]  $30,000 for every man, woman, and child.
[00:17:55.672 --> 00:17:56.633]  That's irresponsible.
[00:17:58.273 --> 00:17:59.374]  It's unpatriotic.
[00:17:59.634 --> 00:18:03.096]  The last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.
[00:18:03.296 --> 00:18:06.838]  You will not see your taxes increased one single dime.
[00:18:07.438 --> 00:18:11.740]  You will not see your taxes increased a single dime.
[00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:15.040]  I repeat, not one single dime.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.721]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:18:18.282 --> 00:18:21.363]  I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.
[00:18:21.864 --> 00:18:26.787]  And so I respect the right of lawful gun owners to protect their families.
[00:18:27.747 --> 00:18:28.308]  I respect that.
[00:18:28.648 --> 00:18:31.550]  That means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens.
[00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.893]  No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime.
[00:18:37.173 --> 00:18:41.816]  And as for those programs we do need, I'll make them work better and I'll make them cost less.
[00:18:42.898 --> 00:18:47.604]  We'll save billions by cutting waste and improving management and strengthening oversight.
[00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:51.129]  And I will finally end the abuse of no-bid contracts once and for all.
[00:18:51.329 --> 00:18:58.079]  I'm in this race to tell the lobbyists in Washington that their days of setting the agenda are over.
[00:18:58.797 --> 00:19:05.259]  That's why today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office.
[00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:06.680]  Guantanamo, that's easy.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.140]  Close down Guantanamo.
[00:19:08.361 --> 00:19:12.302]  No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war.
[00:19:12.602 --> 00:19:16.123]  Do you promise not to use presidential signage to get your way?
[00:19:17.144 --> 00:19:17.344]  Yes.
[00:19:18.044 --> 00:19:22.686]  This is part of the whole theory of George Bush that he can make laws as he's going along.
[00:19:23.793 --> 00:19:24.714]  I disagree with that.
[00:19:25.234 --> 00:19:27.035]  I taught the Constitution for 10 years.
[00:19:27.595 --> 00:19:31.317]  I believe in the Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the United States.
[00:19:31.657 --> 00:19:35.639]  We're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end run around Congress.
[00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:43.403]  Wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do.
[00:19:54.212 --> 00:19:55.413]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:19:55.573 --> 00:19:58.136]  Today I'd like to talk about the War on Women.
[00:19:58.796 --> 00:20:03.101]  You've experienced and heard about the benefits of super male vitality.
[00:20:03.621 --> 00:20:06.124]  Now, the new formula has arrived.
[00:20:06.484 --> 00:20:10.368]  Introducing the new super female vitality.
[00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:18.736]  I have specifically designed this formula to help the body naturally regulate itself without the use of artificial hormones.
[00:20:19.136 --> 00:20:22.437]  Key ingredients chosen from the highest quality sources.
[00:20:22.837 --> 00:20:29.858]  Each of these ingredients work synergistically with the female body in order to maximize overall vitality.
[00:20:30.058 --> 00:20:36.959]  You've heard the reviews and the feedback on how the original super male vitality has revitalized relationships.
[00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:46.601]  Now, both the man and the woman can have the revitalization in their own bodies with super male vitality and super female vitality.

[00:20:57.748 --> 00:21:04.914]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:07.196]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:21:07.376 --> 00:21:12.580]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.824]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:21:17.964 --> 00:21:21.065]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:21:21.365 --> 00:21:25.286]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:21:25.486 --> 00:21:29.787]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:21:29.887 --> 00:21:40.009]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:21:40.229 --> 00:21:42.790]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.592]  And manufactured in the USA.
[00:21:44.692 --> 00:21:51.138]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:55.303]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.332]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News, I'm your host Rob Dew.
[00:22:08.532 --> 00:22:16.958]  Our next guest is an author, economist, he's been in several of Alex's movies, and he's also a former city councilman of Austin, Texas.
[00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:17.779]  It's George Humphrey.
[00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:18.460]  How you doing, sir?
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.141]  Hey Rob, how are you?
[00:22:20.361 --> 00:22:21.742]  I'm doing great, I'm doing great.
[00:22:22.082 --> 00:22:27.146]  So right now you're traveling kind of back and forth between the mainland here and in Thailand.
[00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:30.367]  And you were actually there before the coup d'etat took place.
[00:22:30.387 --> 00:22:38.271]  Yeah, I've been watching what's... It's fun to be able to talk about this because so few people understand what's going on.
[00:22:38.451 --> 00:22:43.013]  And clearly Thailand is a relatively smaller country halfway around the world.
[00:22:43.813 --> 00:22:51.437]  But Thailand is the only country in Southeast Asia that has never been under imperialistic rule.
[00:22:52.267 --> 00:22:53.967]  I mean, he's not ruled by the globalists.
[00:22:53.987 --> 00:23:00.789]  Yeah, but it was never like India was controlled, and China, and Vietnam, and Indonesia.
[00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:06.871]  And the movie The King and I was all about how the Chandra kept the English out.
[00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:13.693]  And so the people of Thailand have a real sense of real independence, and they're very proud of their country.
[00:23:14.053 --> 00:23:14.253]  Yeah.
[00:23:14.473 --> 00:23:17.575]  They're very proud of that, which is, I think, is a great thing.
[00:23:17.635 --> 00:23:22.859]  Just like I'm very proud of being here in the United States, of the good parts of it.
[00:23:23.459 --> 00:23:30.084]  I've been going there for years and years and years, and the reason I keep going back there is because I love it.
[00:23:31.024 --> 00:23:33.846]  You know, the cost of living is about half of what it is here.
[00:23:33.926 --> 00:23:42.212]  They've got clean food without any GMOs or very few GMOs, is that they've got great beaches, they've got great jungles,
[00:23:43.243 --> 00:23:53.894]  The people are Buddhist and so they're more chilled out and it's a fun place and there's a lot of expatriates there who know about Alex Jones and we have these conversations every day.
[00:23:53.994 --> 00:23:57.778]  And there's still technology there, it's not like... Oh yeah, they're smart people.
[00:23:58.199 --> 00:24:03.784]  But Thailand's gotten a lot of bad press lately and about ten years ago a guy called Toxin
[00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:06.126]  Became the Prime Minister.
[00:24:06.146 --> 00:24:07.086]  What a name!
[00:24:07.106 --> 00:24:08.747]  Yeah, Toxin.
[00:24:09.107 --> 00:24:15.151]  And his big claim to fame was that he's good friends with the Bushes and the Carlisle Group.
[00:24:15.731 --> 00:24:25.616]  And guess what happened after, you know, Toxin got in and he started giving all this money to the rice farmers, the poor rice farmers, and of course they're going to take it.
[00:24:25.656 --> 00:24:27.797]  So he's basically buying off the votes.
[00:24:27.817 --> 00:24:32.080]  And as he was buying off the votes, he was robbing the country.
[00:24:33.177 --> 00:24:37.880]  And so he got caught with his arm in the cookie jar.
[00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:47.307]  They threw him out of the country, but because he had the votes, he got his daughter to run, and she became the next Prime Minister.
[00:24:47.347 --> 00:24:49.728]  Her name was Yinluck.
[00:24:49.768 --> 00:24:51.830]  She was a real pretty gal, but she didn't know
[00:24:53.507 --> 00:24:54.147]  We're good to go.
[00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:16.847]  There are all these demonstrations.
[00:25:16.887 --> 00:25:23.009]  There are the yellow shirts who are for the more establishment and the king, and then there was the red shirts who are the rice farmers.
[00:25:23.049 --> 00:25:30.772]  But the red shirts were basically very, very poor people who had been getting all these handouts.
[00:25:31.393 --> 00:25:36.855]  And, you know, they were like any group of people who were in ignorance and given wrong information.
[00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:39.616]  And they went back and forth for a couple of years.
[00:25:39.736 --> 00:25:41.617]  And it was a little bit
[00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:45.703]  Pull and tug, but there was not much.
[00:25:46.563 --> 00:25:49.065]  Maybe 10 or 15 people in the years got killed.
[00:25:49.486 --> 00:25:51.807]  But in the United States, that would have happened every day.
[00:25:52.748 --> 00:25:55.050]  The people of Thailand are great people.
[00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:04.837]  And so finally, the king ordered a coup d'etat, so the army took over, got the old government out, they're settling everything down.
[00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:09.833]  And everything is just fine in Thailand right now.
[00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:14.495]  The biggest thing in Thailand right now is the devil in the deep blue sea.
[00:26:14.895 --> 00:26:22.479]  You've got China to the north, who is the big golden dragon wanting to come down and take over Southeast Asia.
[00:26:22.899 --> 00:26:27.382]  And then you've got Uncle Sam in the United States who wants to keep Thailand.
[00:26:28.822 --> 00:26:32.846]  As supporters, and it's a tough choice for the people of Thailand.
[00:26:33.346 --> 00:26:37.890]  And most of the people of Thailand want to stay independent.
[00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:40.252]  Establish their own destiny.
[00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:40.773]  Yes.
[00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:45.977]  Essentially, and not be told what to do from, you know, what you've had since, you know, the 50s in Vietnam.
[00:26:46.017 --> 00:26:50.541]  You had the French going in there and then we took over from them and it's just been a continuous cycle.
[00:26:50.561 --> 00:26:56.246]  Plus all the other, you know, countries that are there, Cambodia, even parts of
[00:26:57.318 --> 00:26:58.959]  You know, Hong Kong was colonized.
[00:26:59.159 --> 00:27:00.439]  All those areas.
[00:27:00.479 --> 00:27:12.604]  Where I live in Thailand is not that far from a place called Dien Bien Phu, which was the biggest battle of Southeast Asia between the French and Ho Chi Minh.
[00:27:13.464 --> 00:27:22.947]  And the French thought that if they went off into this far wilderness and lured Ho Chi Minh in because of their technology, they could defeat Ho Chi Minh.
[00:27:22.987 --> 00:27:23.828]  But I'll tell you what,
[00:27:24.588 --> 00:27:31.012]  Is that the numbers and the people of Southeast Asia, they're much stronger than we give them credit for.
[00:27:31.072 --> 00:27:35.135]  But anyway, the bottom line is, it's a beautiful place to be.
[00:27:35.475 --> 00:27:41.019]  And as with most stories in the predominant press, you got to read both sides of it.
[00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:45.662]  And a lot of people think things are terrible in Southeast Asia or in Thailand right now.
[00:27:46.642 --> 00:27:56.012]  And I would respectfully disagree, is that they have a good economy, the people work, there is a lot less welfare.
[00:27:56.072 --> 00:27:59.815]  They don't even have 47 million people in their country.
[00:27:59.835 --> 00:28:03.279]  We've got 47 million people in our own country on welfare.
[00:28:03.779 --> 00:28:06.080]  The people in Thailand work.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.322]  They have respect for their king, who is a good king.
[00:28:11.662 --> 00:28:15.663]  They have respect for what some people call democracy.
[00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:20.265]  Even though I don't believe in democracy, I believe in a constitutional republic.
[00:28:20.905 --> 00:28:29.749]  But, you know, again, the main point is, is that we have to, whenever we hear these stories, we need to listen to both sides.
[00:28:29.849 --> 00:28:37.832]  Just like in the Ukraine, we need to listen to the Russian side and we need to listen to the Ukrainian side and the Western European side.
[00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:40.914]  And as you said earlier on, the truth is somewhere
[00:28:41.574 --> 00:28:42.735]  Right in between.
[00:28:42.755 --> 00:28:44.536]  Each side's got elements of the truth in it.
[00:28:44.676 --> 00:28:45.296]  Exactly.
[00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:50.799]  And, you know, by looking at it, when you don't have a dog in the fight, it's easier to look at it more objectively than other people would.
[00:28:50.819 --> 00:28:54.421]  I mean, you live there, but you're not necessarily involved in the government.
[00:28:54.621 --> 00:28:54.781]  No.
[00:28:55.181 --> 00:28:57.062]  So you're looking at it from... I just love... You love the country.
[00:28:57.082 --> 00:29:01.145]  As they say in Pomchok Thai Mak Mak Mak, it says, I love Thailand very much.
[00:29:01.845 --> 00:29:07.068]  And so, you know, but we as Americans, we, you know,
[00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:08.647]  Duh.
[00:29:08.927 --> 00:29:15.493]  We are fed non-stop, 24-7, false information.
[00:29:15.513 --> 00:29:18.536]  It's just amazing!
[00:29:19.474 --> 00:29:25.777]  What lies the predominant media is not just ABC, CBS and NBC.
[00:29:26.017 --> 00:29:30.059]  It is 99% of all the channels on cable.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:38.424]  And I'm a sports fan, and I love sports, but as we all know, sports is the opiate of the masses.
[00:29:39.124 --> 00:29:42.606]  You know, you get people watching television all weekend long.
[00:29:43.246 --> 00:29:47.135]  First it's the spurs versus the Heat, and then it's this, and then it's this.
[00:29:47.155 --> 00:29:51.305]  And you've got a golf tournament, and tennis, and there's always something you can turn on, and they like it like that.
[00:29:54.661 --> 00:29:58.042]  I watched Nadal win yesterday, and I was rooting for him.
[00:29:58.402 --> 00:30:01.763]  But I realize that they're getting us.
[00:30:02.023 --> 00:30:05.624]  And when you watch TV, your energy level goes down.
[00:30:05.744 --> 00:30:07.044]  It goes down, down, down.
[00:30:07.365 --> 00:30:10.645]  It's so much better to be outside, working in your garden.
[00:30:10.665 --> 00:30:11.346]  Playing sports.
[00:30:11.626 --> 00:30:12.866]  Playing sports.
[00:30:13.246 --> 00:30:15.067]  Getting out there and shooting some hoops.
[00:30:15.167 --> 00:30:16.187]  Going swimming.
[00:30:16.547 --> 00:30:17.607]  Taking a walk.
[00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.790]  I think so.
[00:30:42.859 --> 00:30:43.480]  We're good to go.
[00:31:01.607 --> 00:31:03.328]  And that is a real shocker.
[00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:09.772]  When you become aware of that, that's the choice between the blue pill and holding on to the old paradigm.
[00:31:10.873 --> 00:31:12.795]  It's easy to do.
[00:31:12.955 --> 00:31:15.456]  It's so easy to believe.
[00:31:15.556 --> 00:31:16.417]  And they'll make it fun.
[00:31:16.757 --> 00:31:18.298]  They make it fun to do that too.
[00:31:18.418 --> 00:31:20.940]  Oh yeah, you keep turning to sports, keep watching the news.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.122]  Hey, that Starbucks is really tasty.
[00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:24.843]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:24.863 --> 00:31:25.723]  Hey, and you know what?
[00:31:25.803 --> 00:31:29.706]  My new SUV, I've got all the Gosmos and
[00:31:30.146 --> 00:31:35.769]  And I went to the X Games this week, and you know, and I've got, you know, and all this stuff.
[00:31:36.709 --> 00:31:42.772]  And it's not that we say, you don't enjoy this world, because I really believe in enjoying this life.
[00:31:43.593 --> 00:31:45.554]  You know, life, love, and joy.
[00:31:45.814 --> 00:31:57.480]  So enjoy the life, but realize is that our slave masters, they're not my slave master, but the slave masters, the Illuminati, the plutocracy, the cabal, whatever you want to call this group of
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:06.088]  People or families that control the economic, political, cultural and ecclesiastic institutions.
[00:32:08.072 --> 00:32:09.793]  It's that they're not on our side!
[00:32:09.873 --> 00:32:10.093]  No.
[00:32:10.313 --> 00:32:14.574]  It's that it's all about power.
[00:32:15.435 --> 00:32:18.836]  Friends, why do you think there are so many vampire movies?
[00:32:19.096 --> 00:32:21.237]  Why do you think there are so many vampire movies?
[00:32:21.577 --> 00:32:23.617]  Because it's the perfect analogy.
[00:32:24.018 --> 00:32:26.438]  The blood is the life force and the chi.
[00:32:27.099 --> 00:32:33.581]  And these rascals, these rascals, for them it's all about power.
[00:32:34.782 --> 00:32:49.134]  You know, what we're talking about is relatively a small handful of people, less than 300, and in the inner circle it's probably less than 15, that make the decisions about which economy is going to prosper,
[00:32:50.015 --> 00:32:52.057]  Which economy is going to get hit on?
[00:32:53.278 --> 00:32:54.819]  Who's going to war?
[00:32:55.199 --> 00:32:56.600]  Who's going to get the oil?
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.741]  What they're going to say?
[00:32:58.201 --> 00:32:58.922]  All of this stuff.
[00:32:59.262 --> 00:33:05.507]  And friends, as you know, Rob, and as Alex knows, this thing is so much bigger.
[00:33:06.467 --> 00:33:11.251]  It's so much wilder than anybody has any idea about.
[00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:15.174]  And as I was, that movie, The Hunger Games, is so cool.
[00:33:16.164 --> 00:33:23.826]  And if you've seen it, they put all these kids in this thing, and they put them under a dome, and they create all these situations.
[00:33:24.606 --> 00:33:28.327]  And our life, in some ways, is like that.
[00:33:28.947 --> 00:33:31.128]  And it doesn't appear like there's a dome.
[00:33:31.188 --> 00:33:32.808]  It doesn't appear like that.
[00:33:33.089 --> 00:33:35.189]  But do you remember that movie called The Matrix?
[00:33:35.429 --> 00:33:35.669]  Oh, yeah.
[00:33:35.969 --> 00:33:40.971]  Well, do you remember when Neo was talking to the Game Master, and they were in that room with all the TV sets?
[00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:44.652]  And the guy says, you've been here 81 times before.
[00:33:44.672 --> 00:33:45.552]  And he goes, what?
[00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:48.134]  He says, and you still haven't figured it out.
[00:33:48.634 --> 00:33:53.738]  And so, it wasn't Neo, it was the spirit of Neo that had been there.
[00:33:53.758 --> 00:33:54.259]  Exactly.
[00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:55.860]  And having another body coming in.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:02.425]  And you know, I know I don't have all the answers, and I could be full of hot air, but I believe this with all my heart.
[00:34:03.328 --> 00:34:20.098]  And I believe in life is eternal, and I believe that we have lessons to learn, and I think that we as human beings are truly sovereign, and even more importantly, that we have a divine spirit, and that our mission, if we choose to accept it,
[00:34:21.218 --> 00:34:21.278]  Yes.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.381]  There is no game that's more fun than becoming aware of who we are.
[00:34:44.701 --> 00:34:49.223]  And the first thing, though, is to break off these shackles that have been put on us.
[00:34:49.303 --> 00:34:53.004]  Just like when Neo woke up, he pulled the plug.
[00:34:53.484 --> 00:34:55.965]  And friends, guess what?
[00:34:56.405 --> 00:34:56.925]  You too!
[00:34:57.685 --> 00:34:58.446]  You know what?
[00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:20.009]  For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:38.896]  And for every Oklahoma City, for every Waco, for every TW Flight 800, for every 9-11, for all of these situations that create fear, there is a reverse situation where more and more people are waking up.
[00:35:39.296 --> 00:35:43.218]  Just think how much more you know today than you did ten years ago.
[00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:58.033]  I look at what I'm aware of today, and even though I had so much stuff in my head ten years ago, I think that I am happier and more joyful and more alive today.
[00:35:58.633 --> 00:36:05.299]  Because the first thing is to gather the objective information, and getting objective information is not easy.
[00:36:06.192 --> 00:36:09.133]  But then realizing that we have a choice.
[00:36:09.553 --> 00:36:11.133]  We don't have to go down.
[00:36:11.894 --> 00:36:16.495]  You know, friends, and this is, I'll be a little bit serious right now.
[00:36:17.535 --> 00:36:24.777]  If we, if our culture continues going down this road of corporate fascism,
[00:36:25.959 --> 00:36:30.603]  And this country right now is corporate fascist.
[00:36:30.643 --> 00:36:38.069]  We're no longer under, for me we're under republic, but most people are controlled by the corporate fascists.
[00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:39.049]  Our leaders are chosen.
[00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:43.573]  Our leaders are chosen, and the glove wears a velvet glove.
[00:36:43.773 --> 00:36:49.458]  And it's just a matter of time before these son of a guns take the velvet glove off and hit down.
[00:36:49.758 --> 00:36:51.859]  Now if that happens,
[00:36:52.622 --> 00:36:56.144]  And I don't want it to happen, and I think that we can stop this.
[00:36:56.965 --> 00:36:58.325]  But it's not going to be pleasant.
[00:36:58.626 --> 00:37:07.811]  And we've all seen all these sci-fi movies about the future, where 99% of the people are in total poverty and controlled by the machines, la la la la la.
[00:37:08.191 --> 00:37:11.333]  You've got the enforcer class, you've got the peasants, and then you've got the kings on top.
[00:37:11.433 --> 00:37:15.276]  And why do you think, why do you think that they're making all these movies?
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.342]  Because they see us as zombies.
[00:37:18.542 --> 00:37:20.123]  They see us as the ones to be exterminated.
[00:37:20.183 --> 00:37:27.890]  And they're programming all of this into our subconscious, not our conscious, and not even our subconscious, but into our unconsciousness.
[00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.013]  Because the four laws of the universe are this.
[00:37:32.247 --> 00:37:38.393]  The Law of Attraction, the Law of Conscious Manifestation, the Law of Allowance, and the Law of Balance and Harmony.
[00:37:38.813 --> 00:37:49.503]  But they know that if they focus deeply, deeply, deeply on putting this stuff into our reptilian brains, deep, deep, deep, all these fear-based movies, and
[00:37:51.425 --> 00:37:54.566]  60% of the movies that are out are incredibly fear-based.
[00:37:54.606 --> 00:37:56.987]  Now, a lot of them are pretty interesting, and I go see it.
[00:37:57.387 --> 00:38:02.370]  You know, it's not that I'm such a pure person that I don't go see it, because a lot of these movies are interesting.
[00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:04.011]  But they're doing it for a reason.
[00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:04.371]  Oh yeah.
[00:38:04.611 --> 00:38:07.172]  It's not just to make money, it's to program us.
[00:38:07.592 --> 00:38:10.074]  Now that sounds pretty wild to a lot of people, but
[00:38:10.854 --> 00:38:11.775]  I believe it's true.
[00:38:12.535 --> 00:38:16.658]  But we've got to realize that life is a challenge and we've got to meet it.
[00:38:16.818 --> 00:38:19.799]  I mean, nobody's going to come riding up on their white horse.
[00:38:19.879 --> 00:38:27.084]  Nobody from the planet Sirius is going to come down in their flying saucer and say, oh, we're going to take care of everything.
[00:38:27.244 --> 00:38:28.505]  No, that's not going to happen.
[00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:29.085]  And you know what?
[00:38:29.425 --> 00:38:32.047]  I believe in UFOs and I believe in people from Sirius.
[00:38:32.067 --> 00:38:39.171]  But it's not, you know, we as human beings, if we're going to evolve, we have to take personal responsibility.
[00:38:39.571 --> 00:38:40.171]  I wholeheartedly agree.
[00:38:40.292 --> 00:38:41.913]  Personal responsibility.
[00:38:42.193 --> 00:38:55.482]  And that starts with each of us, no matter how much money you've got, no matter what color your skin is, male or female, young or old, da-la-la-la, whether you've got a junior high education or a triple PhD.
[00:38:55.983 --> 00:38:59.125]  And probably you're a lot smarter if you've got a junior high education.
[00:39:01.687 --> 00:39:03.308]  You haven't been to conditioning school.
[00:39:03.748 --> 00:39:04.588]  But you know what?
[00:39:05.269 --> 00:39:11.273]  Is that more and more and more and more people every single day are waking up to this stuff.
[00:39:11.753 --> 00:39:18.298]  The new paradigm is happening because just as we're moving toward this corporate
[00:39:18.738 --> 00:39:25.359]  Fascist takeover, which is already here, is that there's an equal and opposite reaction of people like you.
[00:39:25.499 --> 00:39:33.801]  I come down to the studio, and there's all these people down here who are wide awake, alive and awake and aware.
[00:39:34.561 --> 00:39:42.923]  See, most people are asleep, and then the next thing is to become awake, and then become aware, and then become alive.
[00:39:43.183 --> 00:39:44.404]  One, it's like detoxing, too.
[00:39:44.464 --> 00:39:45.824]  When you detox from the system,
[00:39:46.744 --> 00:39:47.405]  It's not pretty.
[00:39:48.466 --> 00:39:53.652]  It's like Neo, when he unplugs himself, they flush him down the system.
[00:39:54.613 --> 00:39:57.456]  You're no longer held up as, oh, you're a special person.
[00:39:57.476 --> 00:39:59.558]  You're not a human resource any longer.
[00:39:59.618 --> 00:40:00.859]  They flush you down the system.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.580]  It takes a lot.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.723]  You have to realize, what do I do now?
[00:40:04.123 --> 00:40:05.745]  Oh, wow, there's different ways to live life.
[00:40:07.006 --> 00:40:09.487]  A nine-to-five job working for a giant corporation.
[00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:09.767]  Yes.
[00:40:09.887 --> 00:40:11.628]  There's, oh, I could work for myself.
[00:40:11.828 --> 00:40:14.709]  I could get together with like-minded people and start something.
[00:40:14.809 --> 00:40:16.029]  Start my own media group.
[00:40:16.169 --> 00:40:16.589]  You do it?
[00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:20.631]  It is essential that we create our own reality.
[00:40:20.971 --> 00:40:24.452]  The second law is the law of conscious manifestation.
[00:40:24.812 --> 00:40:26.533]  And this is very, very real.
[00:40:27.773 --> 00:40:29.694]  We create what we think about.
[00:40:30.765 --> 00:40:32.526]  We create what we think about.
[00:40:32.967 --> 00:40:41.213]  And have you ever noticed, I mean, when you talk to somebody, you can tell, within five minutes, I can tell where somebody's coming from by listening to their language patterns.
[00:40:41.794 --> 00:40:53.964]  People who say, oh, I'm going to try and do this, oh, I'm going to, you know, the people who are, you know, I hate, the Walmart crowd are a bunch of victims.
[00:40:55.325 --> 00:40:57.727]  And I am very, very, very, very
[00:40:59.102 --> 00:40:59.504]  I think so.
[00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:08.022]  It's a death reality.
[00:41:08.423 --> 00:41:12.767]  It's, you know, the people are overweight, they're, I mean, la la la.
[00:41:12.847 --> 00:41:13.067]  Unhealthy.
[00:41:13.087 --> 00:41:14.088]  And God loves them.
[00:41:14.328 --> 00:41:21.735]  You know, it's not that they're bad human beings, they're experiencing life in the way that they have to, but it's not for me.
[00:41:21.755 --> 00:41:22.316]  Right.
[00:41:22.616 --> 00:41:25.419]  I am not a part, I am not a human resource.
[00:41:26.059 --> 00:41:31.384]  I am not a part of this, this, this corporate, you know,
[00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:42.740]  I am not a part of this Democratic-Republican silliness that goes on between the Bushes and the Clintons and Obama.
[00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:50.923]  As 99% of you who are watching this, you know whether it's Bush or Clinton or Obama or whoever, they're all puppets.
[00:41:50.943 --> 00:41:51.443]  It doesn't matter.
[00:41:51.463 --> 00:41:52.224]  They're all puppets.
[00:41:52.404 --> 00:41:55.825]  And they're all relatively low-level puppets.
[00:41:56.405 --> 00:41:57.406]  Brother Obama!
[00:41:57.466 --> 00:42:04.011]  You know, I made a movie with Alex called The Obama Deception, and then another one called The Fall of the Republic.
[00:42:04.351 --> 00:42:06.152]  And this was before the election.
[00:42:06.713 --> 00:42:10.436]  And we said, Obama's going to do this and this and this and this.
[00:42:10.976 --> 00:42:14.179]  Well, in fact, he's done this and this and this and this.
[00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.220]  And we knew what was going to happen.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.482]  And, you know, is the guy a good speaker?
[00:42:18.662 --> 00:42:19.883]  Yeah, I'd like to sit and talk.
[00:42:19.923 --> 00:42:23.866]  You know, just like Clinton, he's probably a pretty good guy to have a beer with.
[00:42:26.132 --> 00:42:27.573]  They're all pre-programmed.
[00:42:27.593 --> 00:42:28.734]  They're all controlled.
[00:42:29.134 --> 00:42:29.914]  And friends!
[00:42:30.415 --> 00:42:32.236]  That's why InfoWars is so important.
[00:42:32.376 --> 00:42:40.721]  What you're doing right now, this is, even though a lot of people get on Alex's case and InfoWars case, they say, oh, it's just bad news, it's fear-based.
[00:42:41.242 --> 00:42:53.869]  Well, not really, because the first thing to do is to be awake to the, you know, being in this human body, being in this human body, the first thing is, we've got to take care, we've got to survive, we've got to live.
[00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:55.411]  And you know what?
[00:42:55.912 --> 00:43:00.880]  These son-of-a-guns, they make it very hard just to get clean water, clean food.
[00:43:01.641 --> 00:43:02.282]  It's a task.
[00:43:02.362 --> 00:43:04.866]  And this is just the start of it.
[00:43:05.066 --> 00:43:07.450]  They care not an iota.
[00:43:08.749 --> 00:43:09.069]  About
[00:43:27.917 --> 00:43:30.959]  We blew away Hiroshima and then Nagasaki.
[00:43:31.059 --> 00:43:32.040]  Totally defenseless.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.983]  Just like we firebombed Dresden.
[00:43:37.263 --> 00:43:42.827]  And not that just we did it, but the Germans did it to other people and the Japanese did it.
[00:43:43.307 --> 00:43:53.454]  We human beings, if we are given the wrong information, can rationalize the wipeout of huge, huge, huge, huge, huge numbers.
[00:43:54.174 --> 00:43:54.835]  We're good to go.
[00:44:11.568 --> 00:44:14.973]  All they're concerned about, they're true psychic vampires.
[00:44:15.393 --> 00:44:16.514]  All they want is power.
[00:44:16.755 --> 00:44:21.240]  They don't care whether there's 8 billion or 50,000 people, as long as they're in control of this planet.
[00:44:26.593 --> 00:44:40.199]  And, you know, you can go back in history and look at every civilization, and every civilization has been built up and then it creates dictators or crazy people who will wipe out their own people.
[00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:42.199]  It gets top heavy and it falls in on itself.
[00:44:42.219 --> 00:44:46.461]  And just like they say, if you don't learn from history, you're bound to repeat it.
[00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:55.425]  And friends, if we repeat the pattern of history with the increase of technology, which is increasing exponentially,
[00:44:56.803 --> 00:45:00.147]  Friends, we do not want to go down that road.
[00:45:00.207 --> 00:45:01.709]  We do not want that.
[00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.812]  You've got a beautiful life.
[00:45:04.072 --> 00:45:05.734]  Alex has got beautiful children.
[00:45:05.914 --> 00:45:07.216]  I've got beautiful children.
[00:45:07.256 --> 00:45:08.397]  Most people listening here.
[00:45:08.618 --> 00:45:10.800]  But it's not just about the children or the grandchildren.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.601]  It's about us.
[00:45:12.142 --> 00:45:12.963]  I like this life.
[00:45:13.503 --> 00:45:15.445]  I like being on planet Earth.
[00:45:15.825 --> 00:45:16.746]  I love my friends.
[00:45:16.806 --> 00:45:18.307]  I like going to Barton Springs.
[00:45:18.747 --> 00:45:20.789]  I like going into the Rocky Mountains.
[00:45:21.189 --> 00:45:22.671]  I love going to the Himalayas.
[00:45:23.091 --> 00:45:25.052]  I love just being in Kansas.
[00:45:25.693 --> 00:45:32.598]  I like being in body and I am willing to stand up for freedom.
[00:45:33.419 --> 00:45:37.920]  Freedom is so important, but with freedom comes something that's very important.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:38.440]  You know what that is?
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.180]  Responsibility.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.001]  People don't like to have responsibility a lot of the time.
[00:45:42.041 --> 00:45:42.741]  That's the big thing.
[00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:44.882]  Everybody says, give me, give me, give me.
[00:45:44.962 --> 00:45:46.442]  I want freedom, freedom, freedom.
[00:45:46.762 --> 00:45:48.402]  But there's responsibility.
[00:45:48.422 --> 00:45:51.003]  And that's part of the programming aspect.
[00:45:51.023 --> 00:45:52.423]  When you look at TV, what do they call it?
[00:45:52.443 --> 00:45:53.363]  They call it a program.
[00:45:53.643 --> 00:45:54.004]  Yes!
[00:45:54.164 --> 00:45:55.284]  It's not called a show.
[00:45:56.104 --> 00:45:59.727]  Very few people call it... I like to call this a show because we're showing you information.
[00:46:00.027 --> 00:46:01.628]  We're not trying to program you in a certain way.
[00:46:01.648 --> 00:46:03.590]  We're trying to deprogram, I think, a lot of people.
[00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.211]  Yeah, but programming is what they do.
[00:46:05.271 --> 00:46:05.892]  It's a program.
[00:46:05.932 --> 00:46:09.435]  It's got lines of instructions that are designed to get a desired effect.
[00:46:09.575 --> 00:46:10.115]  Exactly.
[00:46:10.636 --> 00:46:15.800]  And as I have said, I have probably done, I don't know how many TV and radio shows,
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.482]  And I'll say it, just don't believe a word I'm saying.
[00:46:19.502 --> 00:46:20.583]  Yeah, go find out for yourself.
[00:46:20.603 --> 00:46:23.884]  Don't believe a word I'm saying, but check it out for yourself.
[00:46:24.065 --> 00:46:25.906]  Listen, use discernment.
[00:46:25.926 --> 00:46:33.110]  We all know, every single one of us knows, in our heart, if we're quiet, we all know what the truth is.
[00:46:34.426 --> 00:46:40.052]  And you know, it's like, I know that there's things that I say that are not factually 100% correct.
[00:46:40.272 --> 00:46:44.576]  I believe them at the time I'm saying them, but I know I make mistakes.
[00:46:44.616 --> 00:46:48.199]  And when I was doing my show, I said, if there's anything I'm saying, just tell me.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.561]  And it's not a debate.
[00:46:49.861 --> 00:46:55.166]  I just want to show and express with you so that each person can make a choice.
[00:46:55.467 --> 00:46:57.328]  And this time, right now,
[00:46:58.169 --> 00:47:16.257]  Is the greatest time of choice ever in the history of mankind because it is, it is the metaphysics of this solar system are changing and it's not just because of politics and economics and things like that.
[00:47:16.837 --> 00:47:23.860]  Is the, because we as human beings are going from a consciousness of Newtonian physics
[00:47:24.878 --> 00:47:30.601]  Which is parts is parts and separation and of politics to quantum.
[00:47:31.201 --> 00:47:35.923]  And you know, the biggest way to understand quantum is everything is light and vibration.
[00:47:35.983 --> 00:47:39.725]  Just like at the start in Genesis it says, in the beginning was the word.
[00:47:40.025 --> 00:47:46.449]  Well actually it says, in the beginning was the vibration and the light and you know, it's all vibration in consciousness.
[00:47:46.469 --> 00:47:47.189]  Words are vibration.
[00:47:47.369 --> 00:47:47.829]  We're good to go.
[00:48:05.479 --> 00:48:10.763]  Or I've changed the vibration and I could have a pink shirt on.
[00:48:10.923 --> 00:48:11.984]  You know what I'm saying.
[00:48:12.124 --> 00:48:25.735]  But by being aware that everything is light and light attracts other light and realizing that our solar system, and this is not some theory, this is absolute proof, is that we're getting
[00:48:26.255 --> 00:48:34.700]  In the last 15 or 20 years, we're getting more and more and more electromagnetic frequency into our solar system, plus radiation and debris.
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:40.923]  But just like, what was that movie with Leonardo DiCaprio where all the buildings were falling down?
[00:48:41.363 --> 00:48:41.904]  That's right.
[00:49:00.342 --> 00:49:08.031]  And so we have the choice, depending on how we use our consciousness, of how we use those changes.
[00:49:08.471 --> 00:49:12.556]  Now this stuff sounds pretty wild at start, but I know you know this.
[00:49:12.576 --> 00:49:13.317]  I felt it.
[00:49:15.459 --> 00:49:15.859]  Feel it!
[00:49:16.199 --> 00:49:36.268]  And as you go down this rabbit hole, first you talk about the Federal Reserve System and how corrupt it is, and then you learn that the Republicans and Democrats are liars, and then you learn that the media and the history and the schools are telling us lies, and then you start realizing, man, it's all baloney!
[00:49:36.328 --> 00:49:42.891]  But then you go deeper and you realize that this is an illusion, and then you go into the science of this.
[00:49:43.951 --> 00:50:04.169]  And you realize that each of us are independent, and if we understand that the science is there, and that the opportunity for incredible change is here with us right now, is that we can turn this planet from a holographic reality into an organic life.
[00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.771]  I'm sure you saw the movie Avatar, right?
[00:50:07.632 --> 00:50:19.318]  The classic analogy between the old paradigm of the corporate wanting to mine and kill and destroy anybody who got in his way for... and I love money.
[00:50:19.538 --> 00:50:23.780]  I go after money just like... but not at the expense of other people.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:28.722]  As opposed to a native population who's in connection with the earth.
[00:50:29.663 --> 00:50:33.925]  And I've seen the movie 15 times, and I'm sure you've seen it many times too.
[00:50:34.405 --> 00:50:39.187]  And it is such a great analogy between the levels of consciousness.
[00:50:39.247 --> 00:50:44.570]  Because the guys who are on the planet digging away, they thought they were doing the right thing.
[00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:47.852]  Those people out there, they're green and they're terrible.
[00:50:48.992 --> 00:50:51.837]  Yeah, we've got to make some money here.
[00:50:52.157 --> 00:50:54.461]  And in their minds, they were doing the right thing.
[00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:56.044]  And the people out there, they were the bad.
[00:50:56.364 --> 00:51:00.511]  But, you know, if we step back and realize
[00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:24.137]  We're here not just to make money, we're here to enjoy life, is to be on our planet, is to grow, is to connect, and one of the greatest ways of growing in happiness is to be aware of our connection with the Divine Mother, with the Earth, with the Cosmos, whatever one wants to call God.
[00:51:25.201 --> 00:51:27.902]  Or the Divine, you know, and without going into all that.
[00:51:28.182 --> 00:51:29.863]  But it's so much more fun!
[00:51:30.503 --> 00:51:31.663]  It's so much more fun!
[00:51:31.803 --> 00:51:44.307]  It's so much more fun than just, you know, grinding away and saying, oh, I'm going to vote for this party as opposed to this party, and they're bad, and these people are evil, and, you know, these... Spending energy doing that.
[00:51:44.767 --> 00:51:46.167]  Keep propping up that paradigm.
[00:51:46.247 --> 00:51:47.548]  Yeah, and you know what?
[00:51:47.828 --> 00:51:58.070]  All these people who are, quote, slave masters, they're actually doing us a service because they're creating a polarity for us to play the game.
[00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:58.690]  To repel off of.
[00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:00.691]  To repel, to see.
[00:52:01.111 --> 00:52:10.973]  And so, you know, the people like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the Morgans, you know, not more power to them, but God, you know, love them.
[00:52:11.013 --> 00:52:12.694]  Because they're going to wake up, too.
[00:52:12.714 --> 00:52:13.614]  The only one I have...
[00:52:14.534 --> 00:52:15.515]  He's a terrible shot.
[00:52:15.535 --> 00:52:16.256]  I know the guy he shot.
[00:52:34.013 --> 00:52:35.674]  I guess he was giving him bad advice at the time.
[00:52:35.734 --> 00:52:48.700]  And who was the boy who gave George Bush all of his political information, the brains behind George Bush, who did all the political analysis, starts with an R, you know who I'm talking about.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.001]  He comes into my coffee shop all the time.
[00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:52.962]  Oh yeah?
[00:52:53.102 --> 00:52:56.103]  Yeah, I just look at him, I just smile and I say, I love you brother.
[00:52:56.123 --> 00:52:58.964]  And he knows I'm looking at him.
[00:52:59.144 --> 00:53:00.305]  It's not Turd Blossom, is it?
[00:53:00.325 --> 00:53:02.466]  No, it's not Turd Blossom, but you know.
[00:53:03.206 --> 00:53:04.387]  He lurks around Austin every once in a while.
[00:53:04.427 --> 00:53:09.071]  Yeah, and it's like, you know, these people, they really believe this stuff, and they get off to it.
[00:53:09.291 --> 00:53:09.591]  Oh yeah.
[00:53:09.791 --> 00:53:10.412]  But you know what?
[00:53:10.892 --> 00:53:11.773]  Stay away from this.
[00:53:11.793 --> 00:53:12.393]  Psychic vampire.
[00:53:12.734 --> 00:53:14.475]  They're literally stealing your energy.
[00:53:14.555 --> 00:53:20.100]  And we just had a series of articles come out where they were saying, you take younger blood and it can regenerate you.
[00:53:20.828 --> 00:53:22.649]  They're doing tests called stem cells.
[00:53:22.669 --> 00:53:23.930]  Yeah, well no, they're doing it with blood.
[00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:25.852]  They're taking blood and transfusing it with rats.
[00:53:25.872 --> 00:53:30.375]  They're taking young rats with old rats and doing blood transfusions and the old rats become younger.
[00:53:30.435 --> 00:53:31.616]  They're able to remember things.
[00:53:31.756 --> 00:53:32.537]  Absolutely!
[00:53:32.717 --> 00:53:40.423]  And so, the whole science, you go back to Dracula drinking blood, and you know, what they say the royals do nowadays is drinking young babies' blood.
[00:53:40.823 --> 00:53:45.787]  Well, now there's a science behind it that, yeah, it does work, at least to them.
[00:53:46.758 --> 00:53:49.360]  But what kind of world are you creating when you do that?
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:55.164]  Friends, what he's talking about sounds really, really wild.
[00:53:55.204 --> 00:53:56.965]  Go check it out yourself.
[00:53:57.205 --> 00:54:10.115]  If you know anything about the word Merovingian, it was a word which was supposed to be the family of the children of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.
[00:54:10.695 --> 00:54:21.609]  And the original Merovingian lived in Lourdes, France, and even the Catholic Church recognized that the one they called Jesus, and of course his name was not Jesus, it was Yeshua ben Joseph.
[00:54:21.629 --> 00:54:24.833]  It always blows me away that all these churches call
[00:54:26.035 --> 00:54:26.395]  That's right.
[00:54:46.696 --> 00:54:53.102]  But that's why the noble families of Europe have paid so much attention to the bloodlines.
[00:54:53.322 --> 00:55:05.193]  But then as time went by, then that all became weird, and some of those Merovingians became the black nobility, and they started doing weird stuff like you're talking about.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:07.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:22.635 --> 00:55:36.161]  Anything you can think about has happened, but the most important thing is to be aware of it, and then to have a much more beautiful life, because if you do believe in the Creator, life is eternal.
[00:55:36.461 --> 00:55:38.482]  There is ultimate prosperity.
[00:55:38.822 --> 00:55:40.223]  There is ultimate life.
[00:55:40.643 --> 00:55:42.084]  There is ultimate joy.
[00:55:42.344 --> 00:55:47.646]  There is ultimate and infinite life and love and joy for all of us, as long as we
[00:55:49.727 --> 00:55:56.414]  Play by the rules, as long as we have love in our hearts, as long as we take care of ourselves and have responsibility.
[00:55:56.754 --> 00:56:03.721]  And it's much more fun to go down that road than the road is that 99% of the people in America are going down.
[00:56:08.306 --> 00:56:09.847]  Empty and saying it's half full.
[00:56:10.047 --> 00:56:10.447]  Yes!
[00:56:10.507 --> 00:56:11.368]  You know, that's a lot of it.
[00:56:11.388 --> 00:56:19.613]  You just switch, you know, sometimes it takes, you know, a beer or two to change that perception or sometimes it takes not drinking a beer or two to change that perception.
[00:56:19.633 --> 00:56:24.255]  Well, sometimes it takes smoking that stuff that's legal in Colorado.
[00:56:25.536 --> 00:56:31.019]  It just takes a little bit of just changing it just a little bit.
[00:56:31.159 --> 00:56:35.661]  And then you realize, oh wow, I don't have to get mad at my kids when they break something or spill.
[00:56:35.962 --> 00:56:36.902]  I can show them how to fix it.
[00:56:37.322 --> 00:56:39.864]  I can show them how to clean it up instead of freaking out on them.
[00:56:39.884 --> 00:56:44.166]  Because dealing with kids, I have three kids, they will test your patience.
[00:56:44.426 --> 00:56:45.527]  Yeah, very much.
[00:56:45.987 --> 00:56:53.431]  I mean, I've raised two kids and, you know, thank God, you know, they're wonderful, but it's a great learning experience.
[00:56:53.671 --> 00:56:54.011]  It is.
[00:56:54.031 --> 00:56:57.393]  But just remember, you're not a victim.
[00:56:57.893 --> 00:56:59.694]  You're not a victim unless you choose it.
[00:56:59.994 --> 00:57:00.875]  Exactly.
[00:57:01.015 --> 00:57:04.897]  And we can create any kind of life that we want.
[00:57:04.937 --> 00:57:07.779]  Now, for a lot of people, they say, oh, that's not possible.
[00:57:08.439 --> 00:57:12.681]  But if you really go back, step back, if you're not in a good relationship,
[00:57:15.148 --> 00:57:16.890]  Well, either change it or get out of it.
[00:57:17.571 --> 00:57:21.576]  If you're not healthy, take the steps to get healthy.
[00:57:22.297 --> 00:57:25.802]  If you're not aware of these things, have the choice to become aware.
[00:57:26.402 --> 00:57:30.808]  If you have toxic people around you, change your friends.
[00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:32.811]  There's a lot of great people out there.
[00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:48.491]  And this show is a very, very major step in that process because not only do you talk about the politics and the economics, but you have great products like Interfood that help people become healthier.
[00:57:49.512 --> 00:57:52.274]  You have other products that are so good.
[00:57:52.294 --> 00:57:53.895]  The X2, the new iodine.
[00:57:53.935 --> 00:58:00.700]  I mean, you taste just a drop of that and you can actually, you know, you put some foods in your mouth and you taste like, oh, they got energy.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:01.981]  You feel it immediately.
[00:58:02.061 --> 00:58:03.022]  No, it's chi.
[00:58:03.102 --> 00:58:09.386]  You know, when I'm in Southeast Asia, I study ancient Daoism, which is all about energy.
[00:58:09.927 --> 00:58:11.288]  It's all about energy.
[00:58:11.648 --> 00:58:15.451]  And there's different ways of looking at life that are, you know, again,
[00:58:16.131 --> 00:58:17.872]  Make life more fun.

[00:58:24.494 --> 00:58:25.195]  What do hobbits do?
[00:58:25.215 --> 00:58:28.536]  They grew food, they smoked their pipes, and they had a good time.
[00:58:28.996 --> 00:58:30.697]  And then they raised more kids and they did it.
[00:58:32.017 --> 00:58:33.978]  And then one of them grew up and destroyed evil.
[00:58:34.178 --> 00:58:35.618]  That's how it actually happened.
[00:58:35.638 --> 00:58:37.359]  But hey, George, it was great for coming.

[00:59:07.242 --> 00:59:09.645]  They've been telling you since you've been born, so it is hard to break out of it.
[00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:17.116]  It's not going to be an easy journey, but you have to start looking at your own, just use your own senses, and you'll know what's right and what's wrong.
[00:59:17.711 --> 00:59:18.291]  It's easy to do.
