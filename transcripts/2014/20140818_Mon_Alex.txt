[00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:04.351]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:08.275]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:16.236]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:17.937]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.678 --> 00:00:19.779]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.241]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:22.922]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:27.187]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.831]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:45.272]  Well, our worst fears are coming true in the season of stage crisis.
[00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:52.758]  DOJ, Communists, New Black Panthers hijacked Ferguson protests.
[00:00:52.818 --> 00:01:01.967]  The police, being heavy-handed up front, including with the press, only incited and then gave a fake moral high ground.
[00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:13.163]  To the worst elements of the protesters, and now from all over the country, not just areas of St.
[00:01:13.203 --> 00:01:29.636]  Louis, we are seeing very racist, race war promoting, hoodlum types descending on the city and on the town.
[00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:39.621]  For a clash with the National Guard and the police, which will then undoubtedly cause more looting around the country.
[00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:47.426]  And then the big issue going into the 2016 elections will be the race war that comes out of this.
[00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:54.211]  And I've been saying that for a week and a half since all of this started.
[00:01:55.873 --> 00:01:56.293]  Or longer.
[00:01:57.915 --> 00:02:03.517]  And I've been saying it since Obama opened up the borders in the Southwest to bring in unlimited illegals.
[00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.018]  Because I can see what they're doing.
[00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.160]  And now we've got the police out of control as well that will only exacerbate that.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.021]  Ferguson Police threatened to shoot a journalist.
[00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:20.722]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:23.183 --> 00:02:29.328]  The National Guard, of course, as of yesterday, have been ordered onto the streets of Ferguson and surrounding areas by the governor.
[00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:31.410]  That will start in the next few hours.
[00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:42.058]  Our three reporters we sent after a week of being there totally exhausted and had already had to come back to take care of family and their dogs and cats and things like that.
[00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:49.084]  But we're going to deploy three reporters back today on an airplane to get there by tonight.
[00:02:51.647 --> 00:03:00.193]  We're going to be sending Marcos Morales, Joe Biggs wants to go back, and of course we're going to send Kit Daniels there as well.
[00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:09.259]  So this is all something we'll be covering live here on air, plus we have all the live feeds by other journalists that are there to discover what happens.
[00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:16.885]  But if we just weigh in and take the side of the police, or just weigh in and take the side of the protesters, we're playing into the globalist plan.
[00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:31.501]  It was easy back when all this started a few weeks ago on Saturday and Sunday night with the limited looting and some of the thugs coming in from inner city areas of St.
[00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:39.168]  Louis proper to exacerbate the tensions already on the streets with the Michael Brown shooting.
[00:03:39.548 --> 00:03:40.649]  The autopsy's out.
[00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.691]  He was shot at least six times, twice in the head.
[00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:47.750]  And I've read the New York Times and other reports about the autopsy.
[00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:52.494]  Limited parts of it have been released, and I can't find out if he was shot in the back or not.
[00:03:52.534 --> 00:03:55.176]  We're going to be looking into that.
[00:03:56.117 --> 00:03:58.199]  We've got the main autopsy up on screen.
[00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:12.650]  They claim he was not shot in the back, but shot in the hand, the forearm, the bicep, the upper arm, the neck, the eye, and grazed over the top of the head.
[00:04:16.932 --> 00:04:22.776]  So we'll be breaking that down today, but guys, do me a favor, because I've just been going off memory here.
[00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:29.100]  Type Justice Department statistic numbers, black on black crime, black on white crime.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.463]  It's usually city by city, but it's between 7 to 12, 14.
[00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:36.405]  It varies, black on black.
[00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:38.346]  Blacks kill the most blacks.
[00:04:42.406 --> 00:04:48.908]  I mean, statistically, it's off the chart, but nobody gets upset in Chicago when four or five people get killed a day, black on black.
[00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:52.108]  And the whole thing's a tragedy.
[00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.690]  But it's the type of racial crisis that Obama was built for.
[00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.111]  We've been telling you for seven years it was coming.
[00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:04.651]  Now, mainstream news says, get ready for race war.
[00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:06.912]  That's the Time Magazine headline.
[00:05:07.192 --> 00:05:07.692]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:16.890]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:48.524]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:05:48.644 --> 00:05:49.646]  Talk about the effects.
[00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:51.447]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:53.087]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:54.468]  I feel like I look better.
[00:05:54.508 --> 00:05:55.168]  I feel better.
[00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:56.268]  I feel sexier.
[00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:57.029]  I love it.
[00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.170]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:08.733]  This is life changing.

[00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.932]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:06:15.952 --> 00:06:16.432]  Security alert.
[00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:17.793]  Security alert.
[00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:19.735]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:20.635]  Analysis.

[00:06:23.718 --> 00:06:28.582]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:29.562]  Prime Directive.
[00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:31.083]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.184 --> 00:06:33.966]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:37.108]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:06:37.288 --> 00:06:39.450]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.071]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:43.392]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:06:43.913 --> 00:06:45.574]  They are never going to stop.
[00:06:45.874 --> 00:06:49.797]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:06:56.881 --> 00:06:57.602]  Imperative.
[00:06:57.862 --> 00:06:59.863]  Destroy Little Planet TV.
[00:06:59.903 --> 00:07:04.306]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:07:04.426 --> 00:07:06.668]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:16.428]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:16.548 --> 00:07:18.689]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:23.970]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.112]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:32.395]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:32.655 --> 00:07:36.518]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:40.962]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:51.071]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:53.813]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:07:53.993 --> 00:08:02.060]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.164]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:26.232 --> 00:08:30.140]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:31.743 --> 00:08:36.451]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:43.302]  Here's what I want to do.
[00:08:43.982 --> 00:09:06.842]  I want to open the phones up for police and military to call into the broadcast today to give their take and their view on the obviously provocateured events by the Justice Department and their operatives like Al Sharpton, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, and others there on the ground in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:09:07.603 --> 00:09:21.893]  Now, we've got that separate from why were the paramilitary police firing rubber bullets, tear gas and things at mainline reporters, the Washington Post being arrested in a McDonald's, our reporters being attacked.
[00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:24.094]  That's a separate issue.
[00:09:25.035 --> 00:09:32.700]  But the local police have been given the armored vehicles, the militarized training by the feds, who then poses the savior coming into town.
[00:09:34.926 --> 00:09:38.548]  And now we've seen looting Friday night, Saturday night, right through last night.
[00:09:38.888 --> 00:09:41.009]  Police reportedly got shot at last night.
[00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:51.834]  So, that's when I told my reporters yesterday, I said, you come home now, you've been there long enough, you're exhausted, I don't want you getting shot.
[00:09:54.175 --> 00:10:03.159]  So we're going to send Marcos Morales and Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels back, but to stay on the periphery
[00:10:05.413 --> 00:10:12.518]  Even behind the mainstream media, because our guys have done enough to monitor the live feeds, to talk to eyewitnesses that come out.
[00:10:12.898 --> 00:10:18.042]  But we are not going to have our reporters, and this is an order because they want to stay and be involved in all of it.
[00:10:18.282 --> 00:10:19.222]  That's my decision.
[00:10:19.823 --> 00:10:26.127]  They're not going to be running around with the National Guard and the state police while somebody is shooting at the police.
[00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:29.109]  I'm not going to have reporters getting shot.
[00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.333]  It is now officially turning into a war zone out there.
[00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:44.879]  So, we're going to keep our reporters on the periphery of this, and the police had better not shoot at them with rubber bullets or anything else when they're on the periphery.
[00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:48.581]  I mean, imagine, Washington Post and the McDonald's, they come over and arrest them.
[00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:51.003]  Washington Post reporter.
[00:10:51.464 --> 00:10:59.530]  My reporters are with Mainline TV, and they say, turn your cameras off hundreds of yards away and open fire on them, targeting the media.
[00:11:01.547 --> 00:11:03.248]  That's never been done in this country before.
[00:11:03.608 --> 00:11:04.289]  It's outrageous.
[00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:06.230]  So that's a separate issue as well.
[00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:28.642]  But the big, overarching situation is clearly Obama wants to trigger a crisis and race war in this country, just like they've opened the borders up, have ignored Congress, are legalizing the illegals by fiat, bringing them in en masse, giving them voter ID cards to vote, giving them driver's license,
[00:11:30.595 --> 00:11:31.956]  This is getting serious.
[00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:40.559]  Most of the people in Ferguson do not like Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson.
[00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:42.040]  They've been booing him to us.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.062]  Jesse Jackson got booed on camera yesterday when he passed around a collection plate.
[00:11:49.703 --> 00:11:51.424]  This is a guy worth tens of millions of dollars.
[00:11:52.605 --> 00:11:57.967]  Imagine, you're in the middle of a war zone and you're passing out a collection plate.
[00:11:58.993 --> 00:12:07.983]  So understand, most of the people that are out there, and that have been out there, have wanted an investigation of the killing of Michael Brown.
[00:12:08.384 --> 00:12:09.965]  And the autopsy is now out.
[00:12:10.785 --> 00:12:14.748]  He was not shot in the back, according to what I read here, and look at it, he was shot in the front.
[00:12:15.428 --> 00:12:17.790]  So, that part of the witness' story isn't true.
[00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.813]  If you believe the autopsy, the Justice Department is doing another autopsy.
[00:12:22.433 --> 00:12:24.254]  The family wants to have an autopsy done.
[00:12:24.274 --> 00:12:28.057]  But the point is, we have all these world events going on.
[00:12:28.477 --> 00:12:33.401]  Supposed Russian convoys being blown up, that Russia now says is an Operation Gleiwitz.
[00:12:33.801 --> 00:12:36.943]  Hitler staged that against Poland to start World War II.
[00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:43.489]  And the Russians are using terms like false flag, Gleiwitz, and there's no video of the blown-up convoy, no evidence.
[00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:49.814]  They're trying to use the downed airliner that a lot of evidence points towards Ukraine shooting down now, a month into this.
[00:12:51.115 --> 00:12:55.459]  They're trying to turn ISIS loose all over the world while claiming they're bombing them to challenge them.
[00:12:55.679 --> 00:13:00.223]  You've got battles in Kurdish-held areas over dams today.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.921]  Over one of the most dangerous dam complexes in the world that could flood Baghdad.
[00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:08.662]  You've got a battle with basically Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[00:13:08.682 --> 00:13:10.042]  New name ISIS going on.
[00:13:11.363 --> 00:13:13.663]  You've got the dollar being devalued quickly.
[00:13:13.683 --> 00:13:16.204]  You've got the depression spreading across the country.
[00:13:16.344 --> 00:13:25.187]  And even Time Magazine and the Associated Press and others admit that there's a depression in the suburbs now.
[00:13:26.007 --> 00:13:29.128]  And that depression is spreading to the suburbs.
[00:13:30.745 --> 00:13:53.932]  And that that's why you're seeing increases of crime, you're seeing increases in violence, you're seeing increases in racial attacks on whites, you're seeing the knockout game increase, and when an old white man gets knocked out and hits his head and dies, white people don't go out and burn things down and riot.
[00:13:54.272 --> 00:13:58.113]  So we need to say, this racially based, the white man did it,
[00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:10.105]  The idea by some of the black leaders is only stoking the flames.
[00:14:18.448 --> 00:14:24.110]  We have a video of Dick Gregory that we'll queue up later and play that Jakari Jackson got an interview with him on Friday.
[00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.571]  We didn't get around to airing it.
[00:14:26.091 --> 00:14:27.472]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:14:28.789 --> 00:14:29.969]  And Dick Gregory's been on the show.
[00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:32.450]  He knows I care about everybody and try to promote freedom.
[00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.312]  But Jakari Jackson walks over and says, you know, the police have been firing rubber bullets at everybody.
[00:14:39.232 --> 00:14:40.093]  That's really wrong.
[00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:43.193]  What's your take on them targeting the press?
[00:14:43.914 --> 00:14:46.134]  Gregory goes, hey, why is Infowars covering up?
[00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:47.535]  Always covering up.
[00:14:49.796 --> 00:14:52.356]  They're not attacking people.
[00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:54.017]  They're attacking black people.
[00:14:54.963 --> 00:14:59.947]  And the only reason the media is now here is because some white reporters got arrested.
[00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.011]  Well, that's not really true.
[00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:07.053]  I mean, I want to get Dick Gregory on, I'll debate him about it.
[00:15:09.615 --> 00:15:12.717]  They're shooting at black reporters, white reporters.
[00:15:13.998 --> 00:15:16.480]  Joe Biggs is as white as the driven snow, blonde hair.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.301]  Walking around, they're targeting him.
[00:15:18.582 --> 00:15:21.064]  Shooting on rubber bullets, flashbangs, everything.
[00:15:21.732 --> 00:15:27.695]  They're targeting Jokari, they're targeting the Washington Post reporters, vice reporters, they're targeting everybody.
[00:15:29.456 --> 00:15:35.379]  And so when Jokari says, it's terrible, why do you think they're shooting at everybody?
[00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:37.160]  And he goes, they're shooting at black people!
[00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:42.243]  So he wanted Jokari to say it was all racially based.
[00:15:45.359 --> 00:15:52.550]  And there's undoubtedly a big element of that going on, but it's to such a level that, hey, Jakar, you need to say it's an attack on black people.
[00:15:55.275 --> 00:15:58.880]  Well, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has come out in Time Magazine
[00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:03.070]  And said that it's basically economically based.
[00:16:03.451 --> 00:16:06.232]  And I agree with Dick Gregory partially it's racially based.
[00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:11.254]  I agree with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar that it's actually economically based.
[00:16:12.135 --> 00:16:27.242]  And it's the whole rap culture and MTV culture does shell it all as an anti-cop, anti-white type mindset which then makes whites become racist and see it as racially based and makes the police see black people period as their enemy
[00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:40.810]  And that's the overarching issue, is that this is being engineered as a clash, which at the end of the day will be a big police state used on everybody, is the point I'm trying to get at.
[00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.171]  But here's the article.
[00:16:42.451 --> 00:16:44.854]  The coming race war won't be about race.
[00:16:45.274 --> 00:16:53.562]  Ferguson is not about systematic racism, it's about class warfare, and how American poor are held back, says Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
[00:16:58.049 --> 00:17:09.453]  Will the recent rioting in Ferguson, Missouri be the tipping point in the struggle against racial injustice, or will it be a major footnote in some future grad student's thesis on civil unrest in the early 21st century?
[00:17:10.134 --> 00:17:11.274]  The answer could be found in 1970.
[00:17:12.395 --> 00:17:12.675]  May.
[00:17:13.315 --> 00:17:14.355]  Kent State shootings.
[00:17:14.776 --> 00:17:15.756]  May 4th, 1970.
[00:17:16.016 --> 00:17:19.797]  The Ohio National Guard opened fire on student protesters at Kent State University.
[00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:25.920]  During those 13 seconds of gunfire, four students were killed, nine were wounded, of whom was permanently paralyzed.
[00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:33.843]  The shock outcry resulted in the nationwide strike of four million students and closed more than 450 campuses.
[00:17:34.703 --> 00:17:38.666]  Five days after the shooting, 100,000 protesters gathered in Washington, D.C.
[00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:47.312]  and the nation's youth were energetically mobilized to end the Vietnam War, racism, sexism, mindless faith in the political establishment.
[00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:49.893]  And then it goes on.
[00:17:51.714 --> 00:17:53.776]  To say you probably haven't heard of the Jackson State shootings.
[00:17:54.176 --> 00:17:55.277]  Ten days after Kent State
[00:17:56.454 --> 00:17:59.939]  Ignited the nation and the predominantly black Jackson State University, Mississippi.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.542]  Police killed two black students.
[00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:06.109]  One, a high school senior, and the other, a father of an 18-month-old baby.
[00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.351]  And then it goes on.
[00:18:11.138 --> 00:18:14.441]  You can see the whole thing shut up to start the Civil War.
[00:18:14.942 --> 00:18:19.226]  I didn't start saying a couple weeks ago when this Ferguson thing started, the Civil War was coming.
[00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:25.572]  I said it five years ago, four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago, a month ago.
[00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:30.496]  And as of a month ago, I was saying it every hour on the hour.
[00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:34.200]  Warning everyone.
[00:18:35.185 --> 00:18:46.833]  See, if people could just turn off their emotions and pull back, whether you're black, white, it doesn't matter, and be smart enough, savvy enough, to see the big picture, we could stop all this.
[00:18:49.114 --> 00:18:54.118]  What do you think bringing in tens of millions of illegals and giving them voter ID cards is for?
[00:18:54.778 --> 00:18:59.241]  What do you think Obama putting our military under NATO command is for?
[00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:00.402]  What do you think
[00:19:01.457 --> 00:19:06.060]  Obama not even signing executive orders, just legalizing whoever he wants is about.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:12.865]  What do you think the armored vehicles being delivered months ago was all about?
[00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:18.909]  Remember the video report we shot on July 17th before this even happened?
[00:19:19.309 --> 00:19:19.609]  U.S.
[00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:26.154]  Army training to fight black Americans at a giant Homeland Security training facility?
[00:19:26.474 --> 00:19:30.357]  Doomsday Disneyland facility used as practice ground?
[00:19:33.703 --> 00:19:35.223]  Or civil unrest.
[00:19:36.204 --> 00:19:37.844]  July 17th.
[00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:40.265]  What is that?
[00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.825]  Three weeks before Ferguson started?
[00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:48.987]  We told you, from our inside sources, they're preparing for nationwide black riots.
[00:19:50.127 --> 00:19:51.588]  And again, that's because
[00:19:53.874 --> 00:19:57.135]  This could be a PSYOP, this whole thing from the beginning.
[00:19:57.356 --> 00:20:02.618]  But what we do know is it's now a PSYOP officially, and the White House isn't letting a good crisis go to waste.
[00:20:02.998 --> 00:20:09.681]  And we've got to figure out how to avert this and stop this before it starts a civil war with a race war on top of it.

[00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:15.011]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:15.451 --> 00:22:23.237]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:23.578 --> 00:22:31.404]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:31.744 --> 00:22:36.489]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.

[00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:29.765]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:29.785 --> 00:24:30.306]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:30.346 --> 00:24:30.727]  Central.
[00:24:30.747 --> 00:24:35.620]  We're here live, ladies and gentlemen, Dave Mustaine from Megadeth bringing us in.
[00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:40.274]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[00:24:40.794 --> 00:24:43.656]  The globalists are robbing the country's pension funds.
[00:24:43.696 --> 00:24:45.917]  They're devaluing the dollar right now.
[00:24:46.698 --> 00:24:57.664]  They are putting in policies to shut down our factories and industry, to shut down our energy sectors, to bring in global regulations over every town and city via Agenda 21.
[00:24:58.145 --> 00:24:59.566]  Our borders are wide open.
[00:24:59.886 --> 00:25:04.309]  The presidency, for all intents and purposes, has become a dictatorial office.
[00:25:05.109 --> 00:25:11.011]  Doesn't mean Obama won't leave, it means Obama is a dictator, and that's even being said in Congress.
[00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:24.295]  So, if you're globalist sitting in Switzerland, or sitting in Luxembourg, or sitting in Grand Cayman, or sitting in Paris or London, how do you take down a region like Ukraine?
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.242]  You get the Western and Eastern Ukrainians fighting with each other.
[00:25:28.662 --> 00:25:29.903]  Both sides have beefs.
[00:25:30.344 --> 00:25:32.265]  Both sides have histories with each other.
[00:25:32.625 --> 00:25:33.846]  Both sides think they're right.
[00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:35.587]  Both sides have good points.
[00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:45.554]  Can you pull back and see how the globalists want to suck Ukraine dry like they've done scores of other European countries in the last decade?
[00:25:46.855 --> 00:25:47.595]  Same thing here.
[00:25:48.436 --> 00:25:52.159]  ISIS has been funded and turned loose by our government, by NATO,
[00:25:52.912 --> 00:25:54.313]  Who now is fighting them.
[00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.414]  People go, well then how do they control them?
[00:25:56.614 --> 00:25:57.014]  They don't.
[00:25:57.274 --> 00:25:58.135]  They turn them loose.
[00:25:58.175 --> 00:25:58.775]  They fund them.
[00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:06.019]  Then when they get out of the lines, when they don't paint by the numbers, and they go into the Kurdish area, they bomb it.
[00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:10.582]  It's the same thing here.
[00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:12.103]  Do you got thugs coming in out of St.
[00:26:12.143 --> 00:26:16.445]  Louis for two weeks organizing this, using any event they can to go loot?
[00:26:16.785 --> 00:26:21.868]  Massive looting compared to what happened a week and a half ago, now taking place in surrounding areas of Ferguson.
[00:26:23.522 --> 00:26:25.323]  National Guard being called in.
[00:26:25.763 --> 00:26:27.505]  The National Guard is just regular folks.
[00:26:27.565 --> 00:26:28.645]  Black, white, you name it.
[00:26:28.685 --> 00:26:30.867]  Hispanic, Americans that just love their family.
[00:26:31.307 --> 00:26:32.808]  On average, some of the best people out there.
[00:26:32.828 --> 00:26:33.228]  Believe me.
[00:26:33.728 --> 00:26:34.489]  I know veterans.
[00:26:34.589 --> 00:26:35.550]  I know National Guard.
[00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.012]  They're the most awake, most informed, best people we've got.
[00:26:39.352 --> 00:26:41.273]  And they're now going to have bottles getting thrown at them.
[00:26:41.313 --> 00:26:42.214]  Molotov cocktails.
[00:26:42.494 --> 00:26:44.435]  They're going to be getting shot at, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:46.096 --> 00:26:47.217]  Black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:48.431 --> 00:26:51.173]  And they're going to start shooting people with rubber bullets and beating them.
[00:26:51.534 --> 00:26:54.556]  And then it's going to be, see what the racists are doing!
[00:26:57.438 --> 00:27:00.381]  But at the same time, why did the police shoot at reporters?
[00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:07.907]  At the same time, why did the feds send known provocateurs from the DOJ in to stir all this up?
[00:27:07.947 --> 00:27:09.989]  And I've talked to lawyers in Kansas City, I know.
[00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:12.471]  I've talked to state police in Kansas City, I know.
[00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:13.631]  And in St.
[00:27:13.671 --> 00:27:13.972]  Louis.
[00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:19.370]  But I first talked to folks in Kansas City, and one of them formerly lived in St.
[00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.790]  Louis and knows the inside baseball.
[00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:25.511]  And they told me, and then I talked to another lawyer I know who lives in St.
[00:27:25.551 --> 00:27:32.033]  Louis and is connected to the police, and he said, they've known from day one this is just going to continue to get worse.
[00:27:33.973 --> 00:27:37.994]  And they wanted to crush it up front, hoping they could just get people off the streets.
[00:27:38.334 --> 00:27:44.296]  Well, I don't know what psychology they're following, because I can tell you gut level, it's only going to make things worse.
[00:27:46.075 --> 00:27:48.456]  And it's now spreading in different parts of the country.
[00:27:48.816 --> 00:27:51.397]  In Florida, in New York, in California.
[00:27:51.697 --> 00:28:04.502]  This is the excuse people need, who are racist, to go out and pull over a truck being driven by a white guy, Reginald Denny, and bash his whole face in, and to burn down people's stores, and to attack.
[00:28:04.582 --> 00:28:12.244]  It is a criminal element that is going to use this, and the higher level criminal element is going to play people off against each other.
[00:28:12.464 --> 00:28:13.565]  Here are some of the headlines.
[00:28:14.946 --> 00:28:16.707]  This is the next level.
[00:28:16.747 --> 00:28:19.449]  I was saying three weeks ago, what's the next big crisis?
[00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:27.774]  The open borders, funding Al Qaeda, trying to start a war with Russia, devaluing the dollar, all these other scams.
[00:28:27.854 --> 00:28:31.336]  And I said, I believe it's going to be race war in this country.
[00:28:32.216 --> 00:28:33.517]  Over and over again, I said that.
[00:28:33.897 --> 00:28:39.961]  You were witnesses to it because I know how the globalists operate.
[00:28:39.981 --> 00:28:43.543]  15, 20 blacks die in a week in Chicago getting shot, black on black.
[00:28:43.563 --> 00:28:44.484]  You don't hear a word about it.
[00:28:46.271 --> 00:28:50.015]  Whether the cop was wrong or in the right, it's a tragedy either way.
[00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:53.378]  Why is it now time to come out and riot?
[00:28:53.719 --> 00:28:56.041]  Why is it now time to come out and burn things down?
[00:28:56.402 --> 00:29:03.629]  And why is it time for the police to act like thugs and shove my reporters around and shoot at them while laughing?
[00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.614]  It is the degeneration of society and its animal mentality
[00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:13.958]  It's mob mentality by the police and by the other side as well.
[00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:20.160]  And you've got all the military equipment, all the checkpoints, and all of it ready, rolling out.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.642]  And this is segwaying the police state from the drug war and the phony war against Al Qaeda.
[00:29:25.122 --> 00:29:27.703]  Now they'll sell it in a race war with black people.
[00:29:29.043 --> 00:29:34.825]  Hispanics will join in because they'll get their orders out of the different Justice Department groups, the illegal aliens.
[00:29:36.065 --> 00:29:38.846]  And then it'll set the precedent for martial law on the streets.
[00:29:40.168 --> 00:29:58.801]  And then after that is set, Homeland Security will be turned against its real enemy, the Tea Party, gun owners, the war on white people that congressmen have talked about, that is being sold, that's the main behind-the-scenes training, is to then flip it around against whites, stage terror attacks, and claim whites did it.
[00:29:58.821 --> 00:30:01.423]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.443 --> 00:30:02.424]  I just laid out their plan.
[00:30:02.664 --> 00:30:04.145]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.165 --> 00:30:05.726]  I just broke it down for you.
[00:30:06.227 --> 00:30:07.608]  I'm gonna break it down again and take your call.
[00:30:09.861 --> 00:30:13.584]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:30:13.684 --> 00:30:14.845]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:15.966]  God knows what's in there.
[00:30:16.246 --> 00:30:20.329]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:30:20.489 --> 00:30:26.234]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:30:26.414 --> 00:30:27.415]  That one is better.
[00:30:27.455 --> 00:30:28.415]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:30:28.716 --> 00:30:30.076]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:30:30.097 --> 00:30:30.677]  It's good water.
[00:30:30.777 --> 00:30:36.521]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:43.826]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[00:30:43.986 --> 00:30:46.468]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:30:46.708 --> 00:30:54.593]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:30:54.693 --> 00:30:55.773]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:30:55.793 --> 00:30:56.753]  It's good water.
[00:30:56.974 --> 00:30:57.414]  Refreshing?
[00:30:57.574 --> 00:30:57.914]  It's good!

[00:31:39.758 --> 00:31:43.260]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.381]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:31:47.702 --> 00:31:49.162]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:31:49.482 --> 00:31:57.046]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:31:57.326 --> 00:31:58.186]  But for how long?

[00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:06.270]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.931]  Just won't quit.
[00:32:09.525 --> 00:32:10.186]  Infowars.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:29.661]  We're good to go.
[00:32:54.804 --> 00:32:58.686]  10% off the already lowest price in this back-to-school week.

[00:33:03.829 --> 00:33:08.812]  You are literally buying war bonds in the battle to awaken humanity.
[00:33:09.795 --> 00:33:10.335]  We've got it.
[00:33:11.075 --> 00:33:16.837]  The transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:16.917 --> 00:33:18.998]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:30.802]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:30.902 --> 00:33:38.685]  How do you bring a republic down that's been so wealthy and has the largest military in the world?
[00:33:40.402 --> 00:33:45.163]  You do it by deception, you do it by subterfuge, by manipulation, by balkanization.
[00:33:48.684 --> 00:33:49.844]  And that's now happened here.
[00:33:51.624 --> 00:33:54.545]  All, quote, sides have legitimate beefs with each other.
[00:33:57.746 --> 00:34:03.047]  But I have the FBI crime statistics right here from the Justice Department.
[00:34:04.207 --> 00:34:07.468]  Crime in the United States 2012, that's the latest year to be out.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:22.648]  And it goes over the black-on-white crime numbers here versus black-on-black.
[00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.132]  And you can see those numbers for yourself if you're a TV viewer.
[00:34:32.016 --> 00:34:35.119]  But for every 193 black people
[00:34:41.854 --> 00:34:47.017]  that are killed by a white person, 2,412 are killed by a black person.
[00:34:48.698 --> 00:34:56.604]  Again, for every 193 blacks killed by a white, 2,412 are killed by a black.
[00:34:58.645 --> 00:35:00.586]  And you can go through these race by race.
[00:35:01.167 --> 00:35:03.848]  You want us to show you the black on white numbers?
[00:35:09.312 --> 00:35:10.713]  Depending on how you slice it,
[00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:15.679]  It is orders of magnitude higher black on white.
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:25.346]  And that's because it is promoted by the Democratic Party and by the new Black Panther Party and others publicly.
[00:35:26.847 --> 00:35:37.734]  The Black Panther Party, new Black Panther Party leader in Houston is famously in the paper, we've had him on the show, saying don't go rob and loot or mug
[00:35:39.406 --> 00:35:41.488]  In black areas, go to white areas and do it to them.
[00:35:41.508 --> 00:35:43.689]  That's a legitimate form of protest.
[00:35:43.709 --> 00:35:56.638]  You know, it's funny, then I had that same person thank me when the CPS is trying to take a black man's and a black lady's four children because he basically lives in an un-air-conditioned little wood house.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.703]  One part of it, then, he did get in air conditioning.
[00:36:04.042 --> 00:36:09.804]  And he was a good father and a good mother, and the guy mowed yards and worked hard, and a lot of people got raised like that.
[00:36:11.205 --> 00:36:12.445]  Just 50, 60 years ago.
[00:36:12.885 --> 00:36:13.946]  Is it illegal to be poor?
[00:36:15.146 --> 00:36:16.487]  I came to that fellow's aid.
[00:36:17.307 --> 00:36:19.027]  The black community was like, why are you helping us?
[00:36:19.047 --> 00:36:19.728]  We can't believe it.
[00:36:20.388 --> 00:36:21.548]  Look, I care about everybody.
[00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:28.731]  When the state comes after you and oppresses you, hey, that can happen to me as well.
[00:36:32.284 --> 00:36:33.645]  And do blacks get profiled?
[00:36:34.505 --> 00:36:37.927]  Do blacks basically get put into the system easier than whites or others?
[00:36:38.387 --> 00:36:38.927]  Undoubtedly!
[00:36:40.028 --> 00:36:46.551]  I don't like the fact that the illegal aliens can drink and drive and get bank accounts without IDs and fly without IDs.
[00:36:47.191 --> 00:36:48.332]  I don't dislike Hispanics.
[00:36:48.452 --> 00:36:50.853]  Most Hispanics don't get to do that if they're citizens.
[00:36:51.633 --> 00:36:54.655]  I'm upset that the system can pick and choose who they want to go after.
[00:36:55.643 --> 00:37:02.028]  But regardless, there is a major racism movement in the black community against white people and others.
[00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:15.419]  And you've got black entertainment television, and you've got movies like Django Unchained, and you have got it being sold in the media as kosher, as cute, to be anti-white.
[00:37:16.516 --> 00:37:18.917]  Just like it's sold with La Raza, the race.
[00:37:19.317 --> 00:37:20.918]  They have Hispanics in a racial group.
[00:37:21.738 --> 00:37:24.039]  How does the government segregate prisons?
[00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:26.560]  Black, white, Hispanic.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.762]  And if it's in an area like San Francisco, black, white, Hispanic, Asian.
[00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:36.106]  And everybody gets put into a gang.
[00:37:36.387 --> 00:37:40.751]  And you've got to join a gang when you go to prison if you don't want to get shanked.
[00:37:41.231 --> 00:37:42.332]  If you don't want to get raped.
[00:37:42.392 --> 00:37:43.513]  If you don't want to get robbed.
[00:37:43.753 --> 00:37:44.914]  If you don't want to get stabbed.
[00:37:44.934 --> 00:37:46.035]  If you don't want to get beat up.
[00:37:46.396 --> 00:37:51.280]  And they're doing that to all of America trying to force us into a gang right now.
[00:37:52.962 --> 00:37:56.865]  And I've actually had people on the street come up to me this weekend because I was downtown a lot.
[00:37:57.205 --> 00:38:00.889]  I went to the city-wide garage sale to try to find some cheap art to hang on the walls.
[00:38:03.544 --> 00:38:15.347]  And I had multiple people come up to me, black and white, and say, we really like your show, but I think it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:38:15.367 --> 00:38:20.088]  I had black folks tell me, I like your show, but let's do it for years.
[00:38:20.108 --> 00:38:22.089]  But you know, you need to decide which side you're going to be on.
[00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:29.622]  And then separately, hours later, I had white people say, hey, I'm not racist, but I'm sick of people attacking me because I'm white.
[00:38:30.002 --> 00:38:32.343]  And you know, the police are doing what they need to.
[00:38:32.363 --> 00:38:33.983]  These are a bunch of racist thugs, Alex.
[00:38:34.423 --> 00:38:35.864]  And you know, why are you all over the map?
[00:38:36.244 --> 00:38:37.784]  I'm trying to stop this from happening.
[00:38:38.004 --> 00:38:39.464]  I don't want to be forced into a group.
[00:38:40.105 --> 00:38:44.826]  I want to be part of a group that promotes liberty, private property, freedom, and prosperity.
[00:38:45.806 --> 00:38:48.406]  I want to stop abortion of 52% of black people.
[00:38:48.946 --> 00:38:51.387]  I don't like the fact that 26% of white people aren't even born.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.381]  I don't want to abort Hispanic babies, black babies, or white babies, because they're all babies.
[00:38:56.781 --> 00:38:59.882]  I have empathy for a black baby, just like I have it for a white baby.
[00:39:02.122 --> 00:39:05.283]  But I tell you, I get upset whenever I see people I know.
[00:39:07.063 --> 00:39:12.764]  They're in Ferguson, black leaders coming over to the camera, and saying, why aren't you saying it's black people being attacked?
[00:39:12.824 --> 00:39:13.484]  Infowars?
[00:39:15.905 --> 00:39:18.125]  Because it's all of our rights being attacked.
[00:39:18.405 --> 00:39:21.486]  When the cops fire at reporters who aren't doing anything wrong,
[00:39:22.762 --> 00:39:25.364]  And arrest Washington Post reporters who are in McDonald's.
[00:39:25.944 --> 00:39:28.787]  They are attacking their own future, their own safety net.
[00:39:28.987 --> 00:39:29.988]  We're all in this together.
[00:39:30.328 --> 00:39:35.192]  I realize the globalists are on the outside manipulating this entire thing.
[00:39:36.313 --> 00:39:37.473]  Playing us like we're fools.
[00:39:39.675 --> 00:39:43.698]  And the Justice Department, the proof is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:39:44.619 --> 00:39:47.041]  People need to put this out on Facebook, Twitter, everywhere.
[00:39:49.358 --> 00:39:53.520]  Nation of Islam and New Black Panthers directing violent protests in Ferguson.
[00:40:00.402 --> 00:40:12.967]  Again, I've had Louis Farrakhan plug me on air and say, Alex Jones warned the government, you try to confiscate our guns, it's going to cause a civil war.
[00:40:13.327 --> 00:40:14.588]  And he agreed, we don't need that.
[00:40:14.888 --> 00:40:16.889]  But then separately, and I don't expect
[00:40:17.657 --> 00:40:19.518]  Lewis Farrakhan runs his whole organization.
[00:40:19.538 --> 00:40:23.219]  Because believe me, I can't, I got great reporters and I can't control what they do.
[00:40:23.579 --> 00:40:24.579]  It's just part of free will.
[00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:26.740]  But he needs to call for calm.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.521]  Because we've got proof in this article that the Nation of Islam is in there stirring up violence.
[00:40:32.521 --> 00:40:33.421]  At least the leaders there.
[00:40:38.103 --> 00:40:42.704]  DOJ, Communists, New Black Panthers hijack Ferguson protest.
[00:40:44.963 --> 00:40:46.624]  And again, I've drawn my line in the sand.
[00:40:46.664 --> 00:40:54.147]  They're going to use the civil unrest and what's happening to try to bring in martial law nationwide, as I've been saying.
[00:40:54.627 --> 00:40:58.088]  And they're already dubbing this in the AP, you name it, as a coming race war.
[00:40:58.108 --> 00:41:04.171]  And you're going to have a whole new age of political correctness to prove that
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:13.625]  Whites aren't racist, you've got to do A, B, and C, and we need more government funding to the inner cities, and more blah blah blah, which won't help the people in the inner cities.
[00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:23.871]  Government help from LBJ, the Klan member, on record, is what did this to the greatest extent for the black community.
[00:41:24.091 --> 00:41:27.312]  The black community was 150 degrees different.
[00:41:28.513 --> 00:41:31.555]  They weren't perfect, so they weren't a 180, but I'd say they were 150 degrees different.
[00:41:34.266 --> 00:41:40.629]  In many metrics and studies, lower crime rates than the white neighborhoods in the 50s.
[00:41:41.509 --> 00:41:43.250]  Total difference today.
[00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.312]  Highest crime rate, undoubtedly black neighborhoods, period.
[00:41:47.652 --> 00:41:48.372]  Killing each other.
[00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:51.313]  And the government shipped drugs into those areas.
[00:41:51.874 --> 00:41:53.234]  And did all sorts of PSYOPs.
[00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:54.675]  So that's my point.
[00:41:55.615 --> 00:41:56.836]  It's still a real threat.
[00:41:57.216 --> 00:42:01.658]  This racism that's been simmering and breeding in these black areas is real.
[00:42:02.657 --> 00:42:14.291]  But nevertheless, it's been manipulated, and so I'm trying to go all the way over the top here and just get people to pull outside the paradigm, see the system from outside the box, and stop it.
[00:42:14.792 --> 00:42:16.073]  I want to give out the toll-free number.
[00:42:17.175 --> 00:42:18.997]  We've already heard from a bunch of Ferguson residents.
[00:42:20.342 --> 00:42:26.224]  Heard from my reporters, we've heard from other reporters, we've heard from geopolitical analysts and cultural analysts on this.
[00:42:26.684 --> 00:42:30.245]  I want to hear from police and military, National Guard, regular army.
[00:42:31.005 --> 00:42:38.347]  Did we or did we not write articles on July 17th, weeks before this started, saying prepare for race war and a staged race war?
[00:42:38.547 --> 00:42:42.928]  In fact, if you want to find where I said it, go back to July 17th in the first hour
[00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.573]  Because I did this video report and I got Watson to write the article.
[00:42:48.613 --> 00:42:51.835]  In fact, I'm not bragging, but my name should be on that article.
[00:42:53.076 --> 00:42:57.179]  Because I was so concerned about this that I worked with Paul to write that article.
[00:42:57.259 --> 00:42:58.400]  I shot the video report.
[00:42:59.907 --> 00:43:01.888]  I broke it all down and had my reporters cover it.
[00:43:02.068 --> 00:43:07.792]  I said the next shoe to drop is black on white stage race war run by the Justice Department.
[00:43:08.433 --> 00:43:13.496]  And I said at the start of this hour, I said, I don't remember when I said it, but look it up, folks, and you'll find it.
[00:43:13.816 --> 00:43:25.684]  And my reporters searched race war, Alex Jones, and they found the YouTube and the Infowars.com article where I said it all.
[00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:30.709]  Army trains to combat black Americans.
[00:43:30.729 --> 00:43:31.069]  82,000 views.
[00:43:31.389 --> 00:43:33.391]  It needs 50 million if we're going to stop this.
[00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:38.495]  In fact, at 2 o'clock today, I want to shoot another report with my predictions out of this.
[00:43:41.057 --> 00:43:44.020]  For the Nightly News tonight, a warning to stop the race war.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.182]  And quite frankly, that's what this is right now.
[00:43:48.902 --> 00:44:10.792]  But they are preparing 24-7 for this, because through MTV, through the social engineering, through the Django Unchained, I know for a fact Quentin Tarantino works for the Justice Department, and that he and Robert Rodriguez meet with them and brag that they're set to get, the numbers vary, $30 million a project from the government.
[00:44:11.372 --> 00:44:13.793]  And that's why Rodriguez met secretly with Obama.
[00:44:16.308 --> 00:44:24.109]  And that's why Rodriguez is absolutely out to get me, basically, is what I've been told by high-level people from every angle of the Hollywood community here in Austin.
[00:44:24.569 --> 00:44:25.610]  Because he is Obama.
[00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:37.732]  And Quentin Tarantino, I've run into him and he looks at me, I've run into Tarantino, not once but twice, and he literally begins just shaking when he sees me and I go the other direction.
[00:44:37.992 --> 00:44:38.832]  Because there's no point.
[00:44:39.152 --> 00:44:41.392]  Because imagine their power trip being part of the government.
[00:44:43.753 --> 00:44:44.413]  Machete!
[00:44:45.413 --> 00:44:46.754]  Go around and kill all the white people.
[00:44:47.274 --> 00:44:49.195]  White people are shooting the pregnant Hispanic women.
[00:44:49.476 --> 00:44:50.776]  No, the Planned Parenthood's doing that.
[00:44:53.498 --> 00:44:55.359]  Shooting them with a scalpel right in the uterus.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:04.365]  Why was the paramilitary police aiming guns at Josh Owens, a guy with a professional camera?
[00:45:07.745 --> 00:45:08.666]  See, it's all bad.
[00:45:08.746 --> 00:45:13.029]  It's all set up for us all to collide with each other in a race war.
[00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.890]  It's all a joke.
[00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:15.331]  Are we that big of suckers?
[00:45:17.493 --> 00:45:18.414]  I'm going to tell you again.
[00:45:20.356 --> 00:45:21.757]  State funding's on record.
[00:45:21.877 --> 00:45:22.637]  I got it pulled.
[00:45:24.939 --> 00:45:29.003]  You got it pulled for these race war films being put out by Rodriguez.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.201]  And they've got Justice Department money.
[00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:37.784]  At least Rodriguez brags at parties and media events that he's getting money from Obama.
[00:45:38.664 --> 00:45:39.965]  That I've got the witnesses of.
[00:45:41.426 --> 00:45:44.427]  Don't forget, I got the script four months before Machete came out.
[00:45:45.388 --> 00:45:46.649]  And he said it wasn't a real script.
[00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:48.730]  Turned out it was the official final script.
[00:45:53.893 --> 00:45:54.613]  I'm gonna say that again.
[00:45:54.973 --> 00:45:58.115]  The government is running these movies and TV shows.
[00:45:58.395 --> 00:46:00.096]  You can turn on any TV show out there.
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:07.583]  Any TV show out there, drama, sitcom, the Patriots are terrorists.
[00:46:07.603 --> 00:46:08.804]  I'm going to explain how this works again.
[00:46:08.824 --> 00:46:09.604]  I'm going to your phone calls.
[00:46:09.964 --> 00:46:10.965]  Toll free number to join us.
[00:46:11.005 --> 00:46:12.606]  I should give the number out for police and military.
[00:46:13.026 --> 00:46:13.226]  It's 800-259-9231.
[00:46:13.247 --> 00:46:13.407]  800-259-9231.
[00:46:13.627 --> 00:46:17.249]  Did I not over and over again tell you exactly what would happen?
[00:46:25.498 --> 00:46:27.679]  I study this 24-7.
[00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:29.180]  I have nightmares about this stuff.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:33.582]  I had dreams all night about this stuff, where I was trying to work this out in my head, how to stop it.
[00:46:37.744 --> 00:46:46.949]  And I've explained this, if they turn loose, the inner-city folks and the illegals, to burn down the country, I will be chairing the military when they put them down.
[00:46:47.669 --> 00:46:53.472]  And I've said this hundreds of times, not because I wanted it to happen, but because the flames will be coming my direction.
[00:46:55.936 --> 00:47:05.246]  And then we'll be sold on the tyranny, and then Americans that actually work and want to have a future will have to leave the nation or join with the New World Order.
[00:47:07.128 --> 00:47:11.932]  See, the Democrats have tried to arrest me, set me up, dirty tricks just like they're doing to Rick Perry.
[00:47:12.473 --> 00:47:13.674]  The Republicans never did that to me.
[00:47:16.317 --> 00:47:16.938]  They forced me.
[00:47:18.988 --> 00:47:25.471]  To basically, tentatively, still say everything I believe and stand up against the Republicans when they're being bad.
[00:47:25.671 --> 00:47:27.852]  But they said, no, you promote guns and anti-abortion.
[00:47:28.112 --> 00:47:29.032]  You're a Republican.
[00:47:29.252 --> 00:47:29.892]  You're with them.
[00:47:30.253 --> 00:47:31.693]  And we're going to get you if we can.
[00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:34.634]  See?
[00:47:35.355 --> 00:47:35.555]  See?
[00:47:35.695 --> 00:47:38.636]  The new old order forces you to choose a side.
[00:47:40.862 --> 00:47:44.064]  When I want to build up these communities, I want them to have freedom.
[00:47:44.584 --> 00:47:49.027]  But you've got to be savvy enough to understand the mind control to be able to stop it.
[00:47:49.267 --> 00:47:52.108]  And I don't know, quite frankly, at this point, how we stop it.
[00:47:52.729 --> 00:47:59.532]  Because there's too many Django Unchaineds, there's too many Jamie Foxes that are going to push race war, there's too many Al Sharptons.
[00:47:59.953 --> 00:48:03.555]  And they're all on the government payroll, and quite frankly, I've tried as hard as I can
[00:48:04.754 --> 00:48:09.917]  And then so many black folks I see that are racist online are like, yeah, we're gonna kill you crackers, you're all scared.
[00:48:10.257 --> 00:48:11.177]  You gotta be kidding.
[00:48:11.637 --> 00:48:15.039]  Do you know how war-like the whole European culture has been forever?
[00:48:15.379 --> 00:48:18.601]  And how many weapons and guns and bunkers are ready right now?
[00:48:18.621 --> 00:48:21.882]  I mean, it's a total joke.
[00:48:22.283 --> 00:48:23.723]  Nobody's coming to my office.
[00:48:24.224 --> 00:48:25.664]  Nobody's coming to my house.
[00:48:26.084 --> 00:48:26.605]  Nobody.
[00:48:27.465 --> 00:48:29.146]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:48:32.614 --> 00:48:35.936]  I don't have some thrill wanting to have a race war with a bunch of black people.
[00:48:36.656 --> 00:48:39.658]  I don't have some thrill wanting to have a race war with anybody.
[00:48:39.718 --> 00:48:41.099]  I don't want to have a war with the cops!
[00:48:41.619 --> 00:48:43.781]  I've said that 50,000 times!
[00:48:45.802 --> 00:48:47.983]  What does MSNBC say every time a cop gets killed?
[00:48:48.183 --> 00:48:49.384]  That I'm behind it and I want it.
[00:48:49.644 --> 00:48:54.347]  Because they know full well I'm not like Al Sharpton and the rest of these Justice Department people.
[00:48:54.827 --> 00:48:56.368]  I'm trying to stop it.
[00:48:56.588 --> 00:48:58.549]  And the proof's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:00.711]  We got Ron in New York as a police officer.
[00:49:01.843 --> 00:49:04.525]  Raul, who's Navy, Wolverine, who's National Guard.
[00:49:04.545 --> 00:49:07.287]  I want to hear from state police in Missouri.
[00:49:08.508 --> 00:49:09.989]  I want to hear from people on the ground.
[00:49:13.011 --> 00:49:16.434]  We're going to go to Brighton and come back with your phone calls, but here's some good news.
[00:49:16.514 --> 00:49:23.719]  Police tell Detroiters to buy guns in city, torn apart by race issues and crime.
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:30.223]  That's the kind of police chief we need, and now citizens are marching in Detroit openly with their M16s.
[00:49:32.483 --> 00:49:33.844]  By the way, it's a black police chief.
[00:49:34.785 --> 00:49:38.908]  See, that's what you need, is leaders that say, we're all going to stand up.
[00:49:39.389 --> 00:49:40.670]  You see anybody looting a business?
[00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:45.374]  You call the police, or if they get near you, you have a gun, you take them out.
[00:49:47.195 --> 00:49:51.819]  See, in Detroit, they got scores of people getting shot every week, who are robbing and raping.
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.082]  Suddenly, the crime rate is starting to go down because so many thugs have been shot.
[00:49:57.503 --> 00:50:00.845]  The answer is to say, hey, you want to protest, you protest.
[00:50:01.205 --> 00:50:03.326]  You go out and try to loot a shop or whatever, you're going to get shot.
[00:50:03.647 --> 00:50:04.487]  It'll stop real quick.
[00:50:06.708 --> 00:50:07.809]  But see, that's not been done.
[00:50:08.029 --> 00:50:09.710]  They've attacked the reporters instead.
[00:50:10.491 --> 00:50:11.972]  They allowed looting to go on.
[00:50:11.992 --> 00:50:13.512]  That's now been confirmed by the state police.
[00:50:14.673 --> 00:50:18.555]  That the Ferguson police stood down, just like the L.A.
[00:50:18.595 --> 00:50:19.756]  riots, until it got out of hand.
[00:50:20.196 --> 00:50:21.037]  Was that on purpose?
[00:50:22.118 --> 00:50:26.100]  I see the hand of the Justice Department and a PSYOP in this big time.
[00:50:27.605 --> 00:50:29.186]  So we're going to come back and take your phone calls.
[00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:36.132]  Please don't forget that we don't even have the money to hire extra reporters and even have reporters in one spot more than a week.
[00:50:36.232 --> 00:50:37.433]  We need to hire more reporters.
[00:50:37.713 --> 00:50:40.216]  We need to hire more video editors, more news reporters.
[00:50:40.576 --> 00:50:41.817]  We need to go to that next level.
[00:50:42.017 --> 00:50:47.742]  That's why you've got to get PrisonPlanet.tv, nightly news subscriptions, $5.95 a month, 11 people can use it.

[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:09.780]  Question.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:14.401]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:51:14.941 --> 00:51:15.781]  Answer, yes.

[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:24.723]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:24.964 --> 00:52:29.265]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:29.485 --> 00:52:33.287]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.447 --> 00:52:39.171]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.

[00:54:14.395 --> 00:54:17.236]  Coming up, I'm also going to break down the indictment of Rick Perry.
[00:54:18.056 --> 00:54:28.238]  I actually know, through a mutual friend, all the details, the arresting officer of the Travis County District Attorney.
[00:54:33.319 --> 00:54:35.940]  And it's just incredible that it's state law
[00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:45.391]  Shows that the governor has veto power and can cut off county funding over an office if you get a boss hog like this woman.
[00:54:46.291 --> 00:54:47.532]  And they've now indicted the governor.
[00:54:48.272 --> 00:54:50.253]  They're indicting a bunch of other governors and people.
[00:54:50.313 --> 00:54:52.414]  The Democrats are going after everybody.
[00:54:53.794 --> 00:54:55.855]  Rosemary Lindbergh spitting on police.
[00:54:56.335 --> 00:54:59.016]  Looked like she was Linda Blair from The Exorcist, literally.
[00:55:00.457 --> 00:55:06.199]  And then wouldn't step down and said, I can drink, I can do whatever I want, as she runs DWI prosecutions.
[00:55:09.535 --> 00:55:12.517]  And they say in Travis County, you criticize the Democrats, they'll just have you arrested.
[00:55:14.418 --> 00:55:19.761]  And now, Rick Perry's got to show up to be fingerprinted, and people go, I thought you don't like Rick Perry for Gardasil.
[00:55:20.281 --> 00:55:22.943]  Of course I don't like Rick Perry for some of the things he's done.
[00:55:23.383 --> 00:55:28.646]  But if we just let the Democrats just arrest all the Republicans, we're going to be in Nazi Germany, folks.
[00:55:28.706 --> 00:55:32.328]  They've been going after Dinesh D'Souza, the Tea Party with the IRS.
[00:55:32.728 --> 00:55:34.049]  The point is, this is dangerous.
[00:55:34.129 --> 00:55:35.229]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:37.691]  Ron in New York, police officer,
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:46.353]  Raul in California Navy, Jim in Ohio Deputy Sheriff, Wolverine National Guard, Phil in New Jersey, Retired Special Ops.
[00:55:46.373 --> 00:55:47.416]  We're going to go to all of you.
[00:55:47.876 --> 00:55:50.401]  And as you hear a caller hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[00:55:51.877 --> 00:55:55.920]  If you're former police and military or current to give your take on what I'm breaking down.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.721]  But the National Guard's coming out tonight.
[00:55:57.741 --> 00:55:59.402]  We're going to have reporters there.
[00:56:00.142 --> 00:56:01.463]  What happens if people get shot?
[00:56:01.643 --> 00:56:04.425]  Even if the cops are getting shot at, they shoot back.
[00:56:05.165 --> 00:56:15.752]  The controlled media will sell it like riots are needed and that it's racially based and then riots will pop up everywhere and anyone defending themselves will be called racist.
[00:56:16.986 --> 00:56:19.269]  And then you see what all the armored vehicles are for.
[00:56:19.689 --> 00:56:21.051]  This is Obama's crisis.
[00:56:21.231 --> 00:56:21.992]  I predicted it.
[00:56:22.252 --> 00:56:23.533]  There'll be even other crises.
[00:56:23.954 --> 00:56:26.997]  This is how they try to bring in a permanent state of emergency.
[00:56:27.458 --> 00:56:30.361]  Ron in New York, what's your take on this as a police officer?
[00:56:31.402 --> 00:56:32.604]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:56:32.724 --> 00:56:33.284]  Good afternoon.
[00:56:33.364 --> 00:56:35.727]  I'm a retired detective.
[00:56:35.847 --> 00:56:37.229]  I just wanted to let you know.
[00:56:38.067 --> 00:56:43.470]  By them not coming to a conclusion with their case, they're inflaming things even more and more.
[00:56:43.931 --> 00:56:48.454]  I'm sure the investigation process was done, and they need to just bring it out in the forefront.
[00:56:48.474 --> 00:56:51.676]  They bring it out in the forefront, and all this stuff is gonna stop.
[00:56:51.956 --> 00:56:55.438]  You know, like I said, it's like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.
[00:56:55.458 --> 00:57:03.503]  They just need to say, you know, what went down between the police officer and Mike Brown, and then this will all be over, as far as, like, you know, my opinion.
[00:57:04.918 --> 00:57:09.783]  I agree that that would help, and I respect that of you, because you've obviously lived through it.
[00:57:10.244 --> 00:57:13.388]  But overall, how bad do you think it'll get if people get shot?
[00:57:13.408 --> 00:57:17.072]  Let's say if ten protesters get shot, three or four of them die.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.361]  Um, it's going to get ugly.
[00:57:19.401 --> 00:57:29.632]  It's going to get ugly, you know, in this country, you know, and like I said, that's the last thing, um, you know, we want to see is, uh, you know, race war, you know, I happen to be, um, you know, I'm a African, uh, American male.
[00:57:29.652 --> 00:57:31.915]  Like I said, you know, I did 20 years in the police force.
[00:57:31.935 --> 00:57:35.899]  Like I said, this is just, you know, a time bomb, you know, waiting to explode.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.123]  And also another thing is like one big thing that I had, um,
[00:57:39.798 --> 00:57:50.242]  What the Ferguson Police Chief did on Friday was with, you know, releasing that videotape with Mike Brown, you know, like you said, you know, as you stated, it had nothing to do with, you know, with him being shot.
[00:57:50.282 --> 00:58:06.589]  And I think that even inflamed things even more, you know, but that's just... Sure, I mean, it's an attempt to demonize Brown, but you can also see the perspective and say, look, he's dangerous, he's roughing people up, this fits into the officer's story that indeed this happened.
[00:58:06.669 --> 00:58:07.710]  Then that goes to the issue
[00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:11.812]  Just like the former police officer I had in here last week, the constitutional lawyer.
[00:58:12.192 --> 00:58:14.154]  Why aren't all the police wearing cameras?
[00:58:16.575 --> 00:58:16.935]  You're right.
[00:58:16.995 --> 00:58:17.776]  I agree with you.
[00:58:17.816 --> 00:58:22.979]  You know, police officers should be, you know, wearing cameras because, you know, some of them do lie.
[00:58:23.119 --> 00:58:23.599]  You know what I mean?
[00:58:23.679 --> 00:58:29.943]  It's just like, you know, just like in the regular world, you have... Sure, but if he's telling the truth, it'll show Michael Brown attacking him.
[00:58:29.963 --> 00:58:35.727]  Well, but Alex, to me, is it justification to shoot him six times as far as him being unarmed?
[00:58:36.841 --> 00:58:41.344]  No, I mean obviously we've got cases of police shooting innocent people all over the country.
[00:58:41.924 --> 00:58:44.826]  I'm just saying having a race war isn't going to fix any of it.
[00:58:45.246 --> 00:58:45.887]  But no, I hear you.
[00:58:45.907 --> 00:58:46.787]  More calls coming up.
[00:58:47.087 --> 00:58:47.568]  Stay with us.
[00:58:47.808 --> 00:58:48.888]  Open phones next hour.
[00:58:49.209 --> 00:58:50.389]  And Fritz Springmeier's coming on.
[00:58:50.429 --> 00:58:51.830]  And Joe Rogan.
[00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:55.212]  Joe Rogan's going to chime in on Ferguson and Moore.
[00:58:55.492 --> 00:58:56.273]  Not the exclusive.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:09.606]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.

[00:59:29.336 --> 00:59:32.837]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:32.997 --> 00:59:36.958]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:37.278 --> 00:59:38.719]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:59:39.039 --> 00:59:44.080]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[01:00:02.392 --> 01:00:04.333]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.793 --> 01:00:07.774]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.497 --> 01:00:16.158]  Big Brother.
[01:00:16.818 --> 01:00:17.858]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.599 --> 01:00:19.719]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.339 --> 01:00:21.160]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.860]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.102]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.662 --> 01:00:31.724]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.154 --> 01:00:36.315]  Obviously, I'm agitated.
[01:00:36.395 --> 01:00:37.216]  I'm upset.
[01:00:37.256 --> 01:00:40.119]  We're playing right into the globalist's hands, as usual.
[01:00:40.619 --> 01:00:44.963]  It's all part of the global destabilization program that's accelerating here domestically.
[01:00:44.983 --> 01:00:46.464]  That's not my view.
[01:00:46.504 --> 01:00:47.005]  That's a fact.
[01:00:47.025 --> 01:00:48.966]  I think we can safely say that.
[01:00:49.006 --> 01:00:53.570]  I predicted that Obama would try to stage a race war with the media, manipulating people.
[01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:57.294]  Regardless of what you think of the cops, what side you're on,
[01:00:59.076 --> 01:01:01.539]  This is being manipulated towards a larger crisis.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:06.946]  While Obama calls for reconciliation, all of his surrogates and minions try to stir it up.
[01:01:07.647 --> 01:01:09.269]  This is globalist divide and conquer.
[01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:12.013]  The National Guard's being deployed to Ferguson.
[01:01:12.393 --> 01:01:13.795]  It's got to be 5,000, 6,000 are on the streets.
[01:01:16.772 --> 01:01:19.434]  This is not a disaster waiting to happen.
[01:01:19.454 --> 01:01:22.517]  This is a disaster that's already happening and it's about to get a lot worse.
[01:01:23.338 --> 01:01:25.820]  And I have that from attorneys in Kansas City and St.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.543]  Louis who know the inside scoop and know the terrain.
[01:01:30.724 --> 01:01:32.365]  I want to get George Norrie on this week.
[01:01:32.725 --> 01:01:33.686]  He's there in St.
[01:01:33.726 --> 01:01:33.986]  Louis.
[01:01:34.767 --> 01:01:35.407]  Hey Alex, I'll tell you what.
[01:02:01.698 --> 01:02:07.422]  This globalist plan and what they're doing to our country is definitely starting to unfold right before our eyes.
[01:02:08.523 --> 01:02:16.428]  And I must say, have you heard the story of the woman that was a spokesman for that officer on the radio this morning?
[01:02:16.748 --> 01:02:17.029]  No!
[01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:21.692]  Okay, she come on the radio this morning.
[01:02:21.812 --> 01:02:24.814]  I heard it on WLW out of Cincinnati.
[01:02:24.894 --> 01:02:26.155]  Oh yeah, WLW, yeah.
[01:02:26.936 --> 01:02:30.238]  Yeah, they played her segment on there and she said,
[01:02:30.996 --> 01:02:41.065]  That when he rolled up on that scene that these two gentlemen were in the middle of the road, he rolled his window down and he said, you know, for him to get out of the road.
[01:02:41.986 --> 01:02:45.109]  And they wouldn't, you know, they was cussing at him or something.
[01:02:45.169 --> 01:02:56.700]  I don't know what was said, but she said that he pulled over a few feet up the road from them on the like the berm and was looking in his mirror at them.
[01:02:57.521 --> 01:03:06.008]  And at that time, he heard come over the radio about these suspects to be on the lookout for that had just robbed this store.
[01:03:06.489 --> 01:03:11.773]  Well, he looked in his mirror, and he thought, my goodness, that looks like the suspects they're talking about.
[01:03:11.813 --> 01:03:22.042]  So he started to deploy from the cruiser, and this gentleman that got shot bull rushed him back into his cruiser.
[01:03:22.915 --> 01:03:25.737]  Well, I gotta say, that fits with the bullet holes in the front.
[01:03:26.097 --> 01:03:34.341]  Remember, they'd all said his hands were up, and that the, uh... Again, I don't think we know the total truth yet, but just entertaining this.
[01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:37.643]  They said the hands were up, and that he was shot in the back.
[01:03:37.663 --> 01:03:42.245]  Well, he wasn't shot in the back, and the police were trying to shoot Senator Amas.
[01:03:42.706 --> 01:03:48.909]  Why would there be bullet holes in his hands, unless he was running forward with his hands in front of his chest?
[01:03:50.151 --> 01:04:03.780]  Well, the story gets better because she said that this officer had said that there was a struggle inside the cruiser, the gun had went off inside the cruiser, and then these two suspects took off.
[01:04:05.186 --> 01:04:17.090]  Knowing now that he'd heard this felony call that had came out, now another felony has taken place because he's tried to get this officer's gun inside the cruiser.
[01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:23.652]  He deploys from the cruiser and these guys are back off of him and the story that he told was that
[01:04:24.713 --> 01:04:28.615]  You know, the gentleman that got shot was saying, you're not going to do nothing.
[01:04:28.815 --> 01:04:30.355]  You know, and he was yelling back at him.
[01:04:30.796 --> 01:04:33.757]  And the officer said that it seemed that he was on something.
[01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:34.497]  I don't know.
[01:04:34.597 --> 01:04:35.397]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:04:35.597 --> 01:04:36.218]  I'll say this.
[01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:41.960]  Somebody email us at ShowTipsInfoWars.com who this person is, the spokesman.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.680]  I want to look into it.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:43.981]  A lot of news breaking.
[01:04:44.561 --> 01:04:48.623]  But he looks like they've now confirmed it's Brown in the video in the shop.
[01:04:49.043 --> 01:04:50.764]  He looks like he's on something right there.
[01:04:51.924 --> 01:04:57.667]  I mean, he looks really whacked out of his mind, and he did have marijuana in his pocket.
[01:04:58.127 --> 01:05:00.808]  That's now come out, a court investigation.
[01:05:01.188 --> 01:05:04.410]  Michael Brown was shot from the front, had marijuana in his system.
[01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:06.811]  I want to hear the rest of the story when we get back.
[01:05:06.851 --> 01:05:07.832]  We'll try to find that clip.
[01:05:07.952 --> 01:05:08.392]  Stay there, sir.

[01:05:43.867 --> 01:05:48.509]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:05:48.629 --> 01:05:49.629]  Talk about the effects.
[01:05:49.969 --> 01:05:51.450]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:53.131]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:05:53.392 --> 01:05:54.452]  I feel like I look better.
[01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:55.133]  I feel better.
[01:05:55.153 --> 01:05:56.274]  I feel sexier.
[01:05:56.294 --> 01:05:56.994]  I love it.
[01:05:57.254 --> 01:06:00.157]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[01:06:09.063 --> 01:06:11.965]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:12.145 --> 01:06:14.067]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[01:06:14.267 --> 01:06:18.490]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet
[01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:18.951]  I don't know.
[01:06:35.211 --> 01:06:43.575]  The InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:06:43.815 --> 01:06:45.756]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:06:45.956 --> 01:06:57.061]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[01:06:57.201 --> 01:07:04.564]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.
[01:07:05.965 --> 01:07:15.429]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:07:15.629 --> 01:07:19.771]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:07:20.191 --> 01:07:24.794]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.776]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:07:28.096 --> 01:07:33.280]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:40.425]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:07:40.925 --> 01:07:44.667]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:07:45.068 --> 01:07:49.851]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:50.171 --> 01:07:58.593]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:07:58.613 --> 01:08:02.854]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:08:03.054 --> 01:08:08.576]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super T-Talk Special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:08:11.716 --> 01:08:13.917]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.497 --> 01:08:17.318]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:32.053]  Paul Joseph Watson will join us briefly at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:32.093 --> 01:08:46.335]  He's got the detailed reports out with Curt Nemo and others at Infowars.com, proving that the DOJ, Communists, and New Black Panthers have hijacked the Ferguson protest and are trying to stir things up and get them violent.
[01:08:47.175 --> 01:08:56.457]  Curt Nemo has another article, Nation of Islam and New Black Panthers directing violent protest in Ferguson and now more nights of intense looting and burning.
[01:08:57.824 --> 01:08:59.366]  The National Guard is being deployed.
[01:08:59.847 --> 01:09:04.833]  Heavy armored vehicles have now shown up and are coming off the backs of 18-wheelers right now.
[01:09:06.074 --> 01:09:08.557]  Meanwhile, a Ferguson cop threatens to shoot a journalist.
[01:09:09.018 --> 01:09:11.902]  Somebody's got to talk to these police, man, about their PR tactics.
[01:09:12.803 --> 01:09:16.848]  I mean, you could not turn the public against you in a more ridiculous way.
[01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:19.492]  This is just bad folks.
[01:09:19.553 --> 01:09:20.554]  Everybody just wants to fight.
[01:09:21.154 --> 01:09:24.258]  Ferguson riots being exacerbated by violent provocateurs.
[01:09:24.839 --> 01:09:26.781]  Again that's Watson has two reports out on that.
[01:09:27.181 --> 01:09:29.865]  National Guard ordered on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:09:31.266 --> 01:09:35.551]  Why were the police in Ferguson told not to stop the rampant looting on Friday night?
[01:09:36.593 --> 01:09:41.635]  Are we on the verge of renewed race riots with the turn in the war cycle 2014?
[01:09:41.896 --> 01:09:48.359]  The Highway Patrol puts out a statement saying outsiders are coming into Ferguson from St.
[01:09:48.379 --> 01:09:52.080]  Louis and other cities to take advantage of it to engage in criminal activity.
[01:09:53.281 --> 01:09:54.001]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:09:54.762 --> 01:09:57.883]  Anybody tries to rob my operation or my house, I'm going to shoot you.
[01:10:00.104 --> 01:10:01.665]  I don't care if you're white or you're black.
[01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:04.446]  I catch somebody coming in my house, I'm going to defend myself.
[01:10:04.506 --> 01:10:05.787]  You understand that?
[01:10:07.898 --> 01:10:11.882]  But the political correct folks are going to promote this and say it's okay, the looting and rioting.
[01:10:12.242 --> 01:10:13.303]  Well, they're just angry.
[01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:19.769]  You know, this is a new race war and a class war and this is what you get because of the inequities out there on and on and on.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.543]  And the establishment is going to let this happen and cause a big fight.
[01:10:24.964 --> 01:10:28.447]  I want to go to Tom and Wolverine and Phil and Raul.
[01:10:28.728 --> 01:10:35.895]  I want to go quickly, but Jim is a deputy sheriff and he was breaking down what he heard on the radio, and I've seen some of these reports as well.
[01:10:36.496 --> 01:10:40.320]  This is what they put in the police report, basically, what you're saying.
[01:10:42.398 --> 01:10:46.302]  About what was seen and reportedly what happened.
[01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:48.604]  So recap it and finish your story.
[01:10:49.364 --> 01:10:54.689]  Dealing with Michael Brown, who again, they tried to use a photo of the guy five years ago looking like a little kid.
[01:10:54.709 --> 01:11:02.456]  I mean, he is a big guy with all these thug pictures, flipping people off with that whole, I'm a gangster, you know, thug attitude.
[01:11:02.777 --> 01:11:04.718]  I'm not saying he deserved to be shot in the back.
[01:11:05.646 --> 01:11:07.787]  But now the autopsy's out, he was shot in the front.
[01:11:07.987 --> 01:11:10.108]  And I'm not defending the police carte blanche.
[01:11:10.809 --> 01:11:12.630]  I mean, we've got checkpoints that are illegal.
[01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:17.212]  We've got the police shooting rubber bullets at innocent reporters and lying about it.
[01:11:18.112 --> 01:11:19.133]  We've got examples.
[01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:30.972]  Of all sorts of stuff, we don't want the police state and a race war will sell the police state, the federalization, the armored vehicles, which again are really meant for the Tea Party.
[01:11:31.452 --> 01:11:38.539]  So after we've set the precedent here and had this splendid little race war, it'll be fun to watch on television for some of the sick voyeurs out there.
[01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:53.735]  We will be left with Homeland Security on the streets of America under the political correctness and then everyone will have to subscribe and subscribe to political correctness as the new religion to never allow the riots of 2014 again.
[01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:56.176]  This is the false flag.
[01:11:57.537 --> 01:11:58.618]  I'm not speculating.
[01:11:59.078 --> 01:12:01.259]  I predicted it all on July 17th.
[01:12:01.539 --> 01:12:05.442]  I did an emergency special report up on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:07.284 --> 01:12:08.885]  And we'll put that on screen for TV viewers.
[01:12:09.385 --> 01:12:09.645]  U.S.
[01:12:09.705 --> 01:12:11.345]  Army trains to fight black Americans.
[01:12:11.746 --> 01:12:16.347]  Doomsday Disneyland facility uses practice ground for civil unrest.
[01:12:16.387 --> 01:12:26.991]  And I say in the video, and in the article, the next shoe to drop will be exacerbating, staging, or manipulating something like this into a conflagration.
[01:12:27.831 --> 01:12:32.713]  And now we have the feds there, openly, manipulating this.
[01:12:32.773 --> 01:12:36.134]  I mean, look at all the race baiting of MSNBC, getting all this hyped up.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.421]  It's like a Ku Klux Klan channel for blacks and Hispanics or something.
[01:12:40.841 --> 01:12:48.362]  But it's all a bunch of white, globalist, and New World Order engineers, leftist, that want Cloward and Piven to bring this country down.
[01:12:48.602 --> 01:12:49.662]  Shut off the power plants.
[01:12:49.862 --> 01:12:51.163]  Bring in unlimited illegals.
[01:12:52.443 --> 01:12:53.403]  Stir everybody up.
[01:12:54.003 --> 01:12:56.324]  Sell the idea that you're poor because of racist white people.
[01:12:56.644 --> 01:12:58.544]  No, you're poor because the globalists offshore.
[01:12:58.784 --> 01:12:59.624]  I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[01:12:59.664 --> 01:13:00.285]  I apologize.
[01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:01.305]  Jim, finish your story.
[01:13:01.345 --> 01:13:01.945]  I'll go to everybody.
[01:13:01.965 --> 01:13:02.245]  Go ahead.
[01:13:03.339 --> 01:13:21.194]  Well, Alex, I'll tell you, if what that woman said is true, when he deployed from that cruiser, this guy was taunting him, and then he full-rushed him again, and after what he had just experienced inside that cruiser, I must say, I would have taken the same action that he took.
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:49.717]  And what makes me absolutely vomit over this whole incident is how the globalists and how these people are turning this probably, and I don't know because I haven't got all the facts yet, what seems to me, if this is true, to be a justifiable act on this officer's part, that these people are trying to turn us against each other and trying to get this country in such an upheaval to where this is going on all over the place.
[01:13:50.477 --> 01:14:07.344]  And I mean, it's just, it's sickening to be an officer in this country and to see, you know, that there are some good men out here that are trying to serve and protect their communities, and then we all get kind of labeled in this one batch, and it's not fair to the good officers that are out there.
[01:14:07.364 --> 01:14:10.405]  Well, exactly, but that's how the black folks feel when the thugs come in from St.
[01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:13.527]  Louis and do all this, and then they all lose their right to demonstrate.
[01:14:14.247 --> 01:14:18.591]  And again, the average cop I know is, most police are really nice, smart people that know what's going on.
[01:14:19.011 --> 01:14:20.092]  I'm just honest about that.
[01:14:20.152 --> 01:14:22.254]  Most police I know are listeners that I run into.
[01:14:22.274 --> 01:14:26.898]  And I don't just mean they come up to me because they're listeners.
[01:14:27.459 --> 01:14:31.483]  I mean, I talk to other police and they say, a lot of police are awake to what's happening.
[01:14:31.743 --> 01:14:33.244]  We don't want to make the police our enemy.
[01:14:33.705 --> 01:14:38.269]  We don't want the globalists to get this whole thing stirred up so they can fully federalize them.
[01:14:38.829 --> 01:14:38.929]  Hello?
[01:14:38.969 --> 01:14:39.850]  Hello, how you doing Alex?
[01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:40.230]  I'm calling.
[01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:42.771]  Thank you for your time to give me to come and talk on the air.
[01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:44.232]  I was in the Navy for two and a half years.
[01:14:44.252 --> 01:14:46.073]  I got out of the military because of all
[01:15:10.319 --> 01:15:14.160]  When I was in there, I see something that is disturbing.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:25.202]  When we're in Guam deployed, we're being trained on kind of like a mock American, normal, cookie cutter, home neighborhood.
[01:15:25.222 --> 01:15:35.784]  We're being trained to go in there, shut it down, set up commands, and pretty much anybody that did not go with what's going on with the martial law,
[01:15:36.522 --> 01:15:41.266]  We have to detain them and arrest them, and we're being trained to go around and confiscate weapons, you know?
[01:15:42.007 --> 01:15:42.527]  Well, that's it.
[01:15:42.587 --> 01:15:50.434]  It is admitted that the military, especially in the last seven years, has accelerated its training for martial law and for gun confiscation.
[01:15:50.754 --> 01:15:51.555]  Look at Katrina.
[01:15:51.835 --> 01:15:58.020]  For all the good old boys out there that just see a bunch of thugs and, hey, let's crush these looters, understand.
[01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:04.305]  Once New Orleans descended into chaos, they went to the high and dry areas and confiscated the guns.
[01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:10.951]  So people need to understand that this globalist manipulation is just that, a manipulation.
[01:16:11.371 --> 01:16:21.779]  And I don't know how to stop it now because you've got Justice Department people, you've got the racist thug New Black Panther Party in the middle of this, clearly trying to stir it up.
[01:16:22.279 --> 01:16:23.640]  And it's a serious situation.
[01:16:24.141 --> 01:16:28.144]  Wolverine in Tennessee, your National Guard, what's your breakdown on this?
[01:16:29.386 --> 01:16:38.729]  Well, Alex, I mean, first off, it's an honor to talk to you, but secondly, I mean, the National Guard's training for this, because that's what we're designed for, the National Guard, you know what I mean?
[01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:41.090]  And now you've got, like, the new Battlefield game.
[01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:43.991]  You actually hunt down Tea Partiers with the Gadsden flag.
[01:16:44.011 --> 01:16:48.613]  Those are the enemies in the video games, and like you said, complete die-offs from that perspective, too.
[01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:51.194]  Also, I've got a cousin in the Navy.
[01:16:51.234 --> 01:16:53.375]  He rolled up on a FEMA camp, and me and him,
[01:16:54.016 --> 01:16:54.516]  I think so.
[01:17:19.278 --> 01:17:20.139]  You're absolutely right.
[01:17:20.259 --> 01:17:21.600]  Before they brought in all these U.N.
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:27.344]  controls in the national parks, they cut their pay for a year and then said, do what we say and the money will come back.
[01:17:28.225 --> 01:17:29.025]  And that's what they do.
[01:17:29.326 --> 01:17:31.047]  They socially engineer people.
[01:17:31.928 --> 01:17:41.975]  And it's now come out that they do have the Justice Department there running things and provocateuring things to try to stir this up.
[01:17:42.135 --> 01:17:45.858]  And it's another betrayal of the entire community, especially black folks.
[01:17:45.918 --> 01:17:46.719]  I appreciate your call.
[01:17:48.154 --> 01:17:48.935]  Phil in New Jersey.
[01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:49.775]  We're moving quick now.
[01:17:50.176 --> 01:17:51.517]  Retired Special Operations.
[01:17:51.577 --> 01:17:53.419]  Phil, what is your breakdown on this?
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.843]  Well, you know, unfortunately, Alex, I think it's everything that you've been saying coming to unfold.
[01:17:59.164 --> 01:18:07.431]  And to, I guess, quote one of your guests that you have on quite frequently, if something's going on over here, what's going on on the other side that's kind of more important.
[01:18:08.806 --> 01:18:14.588]  You know, if this is happening, there's got to be something else bigger happening behind our backs that just isn't making it out there.
[01:18:14.608 --> 01:18:16.968]  And unfortunately, I think that you're kind of spot on with it.
[01:18:17.469 --> 01:18:30.753]  And also, I wanted to kind of mention to you about something that I was a part of in the Special Operations community that was happening at my unit was how we were trying to set up, actually it's being set up, it's called DomOps Domestic Operations.
[01:18:31.433 --> 01:18:35.254]  And what that was is basically getting some of us to
[01:18:37.291 --> 01:18:39.972]  Sure, that's been going on since the 80s, secretly.
[01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:43.013]  We were given a secret document by an FBI agent
[01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:07.933]  On I-35 during an Army checkpoint.
[01:19:08.413 --> 01:19:12.357]  And we don't know to this day whether he gave it to it on purpose or it was a mistake.
[01:19:12.817 --> 01:19:13.898]  But it was classified.
[01:19:14.339 --> 01:19:16.161]  And the document's on InfoWars.com.
[01:19:16.201 --> 01:19:17.001]  It made the news.
[01:19:19.043 --> 01:19:28.052]  And it said that regular Army was doing checkpoints, door kicking, warrant service, all under the cover of bomb disposal, EOD.
[01:19:28.493 --> 01:19:29.534]  But that's only the cover.
[01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:33.330]  And yes, the FBI is over it, domestically.
[01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:38.793]  But let's say it was a 1 on a Richter scale, it's like a 50 now.
[01:19:38.813 --> 01:19:42.094]  I mean, it was very secretive back then.
[01:19:42.134 --> 01:19:53.480]  But Mike Hanson was on the side of the road, the police had threatened to arrest him, he got back 200 yards, FBI agent pulls up in a black sedan, gets out and goes, here is for the press, this is what's going on, now you need to leave or you're going to get arrested.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:59.643]  And Mike Hanson said, okay, he'd already gotten footage, got in his car, left, and it was a secret document.
[01:20:00.373 --> 01:20:01.857]  I mean, in an unmarked FBI car.
[01:20:02.218 --> 01:20:02.860]  Just pulls up.
[01:20:03.722 --> 01:20:04.424]  Here's your document.

[01:21:09.235 --> 01:21:11.817]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:12.077 --> 01:21:16.939]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:25.064]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:25.324 --> 01:21:29.627]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:29.847 --> 01:21:33.649]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:33.809 --> 01:21:39.514]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:39.754 --> 01:21:42.536]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:42.916 --> 01:21:48.140]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.910]  This is an alert.
[01:23:09.171 --> 01:23:13.152]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[01:23:13.272 --> 01:23:17.354]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[01:23:17.494 --> 01:23:22.777]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.

[01:23:59.997 --> 01:24:00.897]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[01:24:13.351 --> 01:24:17.814]  Well, the Time Magazine headline is, the coming race war won't be about race.
[01:24:17.834 --> 01:24:29.062]  So if you're Reginald Denny and folks throw rocks into your 18-wheeler cab window, drag you out and kill you because you're white,
[01:24:30.427 --> 01:24:30.887]  No, no, no, no.
[01:24:30.907 --> 01:24:33.089]  They didn't kill you because you were white, even though they did.
[01:24:33.109 --> 01:24:44.779]  You deserve it because it's part of your class as a truck driver that can barely pay his rent to almost be killed because, well, somebody else died, so it's your fault.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:45.420]  You need to die.
[01:24:48.002 --> 01:24:50.184]  And this is how the left's going to take over America.
[01:24:50.224 --> 01:24:57.571]  They're going to stage all this, provocateur this, use a tragedy to bring this into place, and then have the middle class
[01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:20.175]  I don't care what color you are, cheering the National Guard on as they stop riots around the country, which actually stirs up more riots, and then the establishment will stage terror attacks, claiming that it's the right wing and the veterans that are angry at the government, and so now Homeland Security's got to arrest all of them.
[01:25:21.598 --> 01:25:23.039]  And I keep telling you, this is the plan.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.061]  You notice it's just following the script.
[01:25:25.642 --> 01:25:27.163]  I know the New World Order.
[01:25:27.844 --> 01:25:29.826]  Phil in New Jersey, retired special ops.
[01:25:31.267 --> 01:25:44.219]  My second police state film, The Takeover, from the year 2000, has video of the army checkpoint, video of the document, where it says, do not hesitate to call us 24 hours a day.
[01:25:48.183 --> 01:25:51.368]  Seven days a week we're ready to serve warrants, whatever you want.
[01:25:51.908 --> 01:25:52.369]  We're here.
[01:25:53.751 --> 01:25:56.294]  And the issue is secret government.
[01:25:57.296 --> 01:25:58.117]  Totally illegal.
[01:25:58.778 --> 01:26:00.079]  The end of Posse Comitatus.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.262]  Just like the NSA, the rest of it.
[01:26:02.583 --> 01:26:04.546]  They sell all this illegal stuff.
[01:26:06.368 --> 01:26:13.414]  As part of the drug war, while the whole time it's being built up to target the American people during the total takeover.
[01:26:13.814 --> 01:26:16.517]  So how do you get the right wing to accept troops on the streets?
[01:26:17.137 --> 01:26:18.218]  Use them against black people.
[01:26:20.861 --> 01:26:24.744]  This is the full spectrum dominance mastery of what they're carrying out.
[01:26:25.184 --> 01:26:33.752]  And I cringe to think what's going to happen with the National Guard as demonstrations start to spread nationwide because you've got provocateurs
[01:26:34.895 --> 01:26:41.998]  From the Justice Department inside right now, we have the articles and the video and the proof up on InfoWars.com.
[01:26:42.538 --> 01:26:43.799]  Any other points, Phil?
[01:26:44.859 --> 01:26:45.699]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:26:45.779 --> 01:26:47.640]  I think, I mean, you're completely on with that.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.041]  Like, how do you get the right wing to go with it?
[01:26:49.061 --> 01:26:50.581]  But I think they're already on board with it.
[01:26:50.601 --> 01:26:55.343]  Like, how are you able to sell their, you know, their supporters on going along with it?
[01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:57.644]  You know, the mainstream, you know,
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.261]  Left and right are playing in the same tent.
[01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:02.943]  They're just enemies out on the world stage.
[01:27:03.323 --> 01:27:10.467]  You know, another point I want to bring up is that I've been across five different websites during the commercial break, and I'm seeing all this different information.
[01:27:11.008 --> 01:27:14.190]  And now one thing that's out there is like, how does this guy get shot in his hand?
[01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:14.430]  He's 6'4".
[01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:22.715]  I'm a firearms instructor also, and I'll tell you one of the most difficult weapons that I've, you know, had to help people learn how to shoot is a handgun.
[01:27:23.103 --> 01:27:26.605]  Well, I mean, if somebody's bull rushing you, they're going to have their hands out in front of their chest.
[01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:30.668]  You're going to be shooting center of mass where some of the bullet holes are.
[01:27:30.688 --> 01:27:31.708]  It's going to go through your hands.
[01:27:48.729 --> 01:27:52.210]  Like his hands are up over his head, and it goes back to all the stuff that you keep on saying.
[01:27:52.230 --> 01:27:53.390]  It's a disinformation.
[01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:58.691]  And like, I'm just sitting back trying to get all the information to make an intelligent decision about this without passing judgment.
[01:27:58.791 --> 01:28:13.854]  Well, the police have been caught lying so many times that I get people not buying what they're saying, but that's a separate issue from the fact that the globalists want to destabilize this country.
[01:28:14.739 --> 01:28:18.160]  And for all of us, that's what we should be worried about.
[01:28:18.621 --> 01:28:27.544]  That's what we should be focused on, is what is the Justice Department, the new Black Panther Party, and all these acorn-type grips down there, what are they doing?
[01:28:27.804 --> 01:28:30.806]  And they're trying to stir things up to make it even bigger.
[01:28:32.146 --> 01:28:38.509]  And the police did things like attacking reporters and then lying about it that only hurts their credibility.
[01:28:38.569 --> 01:28:43.611]  So it's a perfect storm of screw-ups here, or it's being done on purpose.
[01:28:45.253 --> 01:28:48.254]  Tom in New York, a former police, what's your view on all this?
[01:28:49.235 --> 01:28:54.297]  Alright, let's go to this real fast and be right on the point with it because your first two callers were correct.
[01:28:55.197 --> 01:29:08.363]  The first thing is we need to come back to the initial event and your second caller that described the woman that has given testimony saying that she is a friend of the fiancé or girlfriend of the officer involved in this.
[01:29:09.509 --> 01:29:19.172]  Uh, in her account, it matches up with other details, the witnesses that took video that you can find on YouTube that were at the scene where Michael Brown's body was laying in the street.
[01:29:19.912 --> 01:29:27.774]  A man can be heard in the background, uh, describing how when the officer pulled up on him, people surrounding him were questioning his positioning in the street.
[01:29:28.594 --> 01:29:33.116]  And from that, they started asking, well, how did he get in that exact position?
[01:29:33.136 --> 01:29:37.957]  A man can be heard saying in the background that initially he was up on the truck,
[01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:50.491]  He ran, turned around, came back towards the vehicle, and several times what he described as dumping, meaning unloading the clip on what would have been Michael Brown, he thought he was missing him.
[01:29:51.371 --> 01:29:59.518]  Which then ties in to also the story that the woman had given, claiming that when she had spoken... Hold on, I want to hear about this when we come back.
[01:29:59.538 --> 01:30:00.099]  Stay with us.
[01:30:00.139 --> 01:30:01.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.621 --> 01:30:05.323]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.648 --> 01:30:13.452]  InfowarsStore.com from this Monday to next.

[01:30:27.386 --> 01:30:33.472]  We are doing this special to draw attention to the brainwashing that's taking place in the media and in the public schools.
[01:30:33.652 --> 01:30:37.313]  And in many of the private schools and the quote higher levels of education.
[01:30:37.594 --> 01:30:41.395]  Infowars.com is right at the tip of the spear worldwide.
[01:30:41.595 --> 01:30:48.578]  That's why it's essential to take advantage of this 10% off across the board special at Infowarsstore.com.

[01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:08.914]  You are literally buying war bonds in the battle to awaken humanity.
[01:31:10.083 --> 01:31:11.864]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[01:31:12.365 --> 01:31:19.329]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:31:19.789 --> 01:31:30.196]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:31:30.617 --> 01:31:39.863]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:31:40.583 --> 01:31:44.004]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:31:44.644 --> 01:31:48.084]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:31:48.405 --> 01:31:50.005]  Experience the new formula.
[01:31:50.465 --> 01:31:52.445]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:31:53.045 --> 01:31:54.046]  Shield your family.
[01:31:54.366 --> 01:31:55.766]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:31:56.186 --> 01:31:58.806]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:03.307]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:08.444 --> 01:32:10.825]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[01:32:10.925 --> 01:32:17.449]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:20.231]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[01:32:20.411 --> 01:32:22.172]  If not, then I want to know why.
[01:32:22.352 --> 01:32:24.573]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[01:32:24.673 --> 01:32:28.876]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[01:32:29.136 --> 01:32:30.137]  I say, so what?
[01:32:30.277 --> 01:32:32.299]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[01:32:32.499 --> 01:32:35.621]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[01:32:35.881 --> 01:32:40.004]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[01:32:40.145 --> 01:32:45.809]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm still fighting.
[01:32:45.989 --> 01:32:49.011]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[01:32:49.211 --> 01:32:50.913]  The Info War is worldwide.
[01:32:51.033 --> 01:32:55.176]  Tell your friends about Info Wars, and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[01:32:55.376 --> 01:32:58.959]  It's real journalism and news, backed up by documented facts.
[01:32:59.059 --> 01:33:06.157]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[01:33:06.317 --> 01:33:07.781]  The truth will set them free!
[01:33:09.321 --> 01:33:23.073]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[01:33:23.273 --> 01:33:28.838]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:33:30.267 --> 01:33:32.128]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[01:33:32.228 --> 01:33:36.829]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[01:33:36.849 --> 01:33:43.592]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:33:43.672 --> 01:33:43.932]  Enough.
[01:33:44.492 --> 01:33:44.792]  Enough.
[01:33:45.292 --> 01:33:45.572]  Enough.
[01:33:46.293 --> 01:33:46.493]  Enough.
[01:33:46.793 --> 01:33:47.833]  Mayor Bloomberg, how you doing?
[01:33:47.853 --> 01:33:49.054]  Jason, I grew up in Brooklyn.
[01:33:49.114 --> 01:33:52.415]  In the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your entire security team?
[01:33:52.435 --> 01:33:54.876]  Uh, you will get back to me.
[01:33:54.896 --> 01:33:55.576]  You'll get back to me?
[01:34:04.717 --> 01:34:08.960]  They may feel that it's part of a romanticized culture.
[01:34:09.681 --> 01:34:13.564]  There's an aspect of this, a kind of Wild West, cowboy, Dirty Harry aspect.
[01:34:13.764 --> 01:34:16.546]  There's also an aspect... So they're macho men and they gotta have a gun?
[01:34:16.586 --> 01:34:17.107]  Go ahead.
[01:34:18.147 --> 01:34:18.988]  Make my day.
[01:34:19.368 --> 01:34:20.870]  Anybody that wants to disarm me...
[01:34:23.131 --> 01:34:27.492]  A trio of would-be burglars picked the wrong Albuquerque house to break into.
[01:34:27.632 --> 01:34:35.135]  Police say when the three teens pried open the door, a brave little girl was waiting for them, locked and loaded.
[01:34:35.415 --> 01:34:38.676]  It's harder to use an assault weapon than hit something that is a shotgun, okay?
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.021]  You don't need an AR-15.
[01:34:50.601 --> 01:34:51.741]  It's harder to aim.
[01:34:52.122 --> 01:34:53.302]  It's harder to use.
[01:34:58.744 --> 01:35:01.985]  In fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself.
[01:35:02.466 --> 01:35:03.186]  Buy a shotgun.
[01:35:04.713 --> 01:35:05.113]  Why shotgun?
[01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:21.718]  Vice President Biden and I had a meeting with a group of technology people and talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear.
[01:35:21.978 --> 01:35:27.260]  Anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless, people that want to literally create the proven
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:33.424]  Places where more innocents are killed called gun-free zones, we're gonna beat you.
[01:35:33.604 --> 01:35:36.466]  We're gonna vote you out of office or suck on my machine gun.
[01:35:36.506 --> 01:35:43.690]  That's why you're going to fail and the establishment knows no matter how much propaganda, the Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:44.591]  Guns will be taken.
[01:35:44.631 --> 01:35:45.832]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:35:46.112 --> 01:35:47.013]  We will take all weapons.
[01:35:47.313 --> 01:35:55.558]  I believe that as Americans, we have a right to arm ourselves against criminals, but we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[01:35:55.899 --> 01:35:57.840]  The United States military is not out to get us.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.742]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:36:02.822 --> 01:36:06.763]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:36:06.783 --> 01:36:16.747]  The Second Amendment is there, and it was put in there not for hunting and fishing, like they like to say, because back when they did it, if you didn't hunt or fish, you didn't eat.
[01:36:17.267 --> 01:36:26.831]  It was put in there so the citizens would have the ability, if their government became oppressive, they could defend themselves against oppressive government.
[01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:38.649]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns, and I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:36:45.153 --> 01:36:46.954]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:36:47.455 --> 01:36:53.678]  I wouldn't feel comfortable having an argument with him in his home where he had access to his 50 weapons.
[01:36:53.938 --> 01:36:59.882]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him!
[01:37:00.102 --> 01:37:00.822]  I'd love to see that!
[01:37:00.942 --> 01:37:01.403]  In uniform!
[01:37:01.443 --> 01:37:02.163]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:37:02.223 --> 01:37:05.605]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:18.371]  And we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[01:37:18.731 --> 01:37:23.894]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:37:24.274 --> 01:37:29.516]  And their answer is they're going to open the borders up and instantly let anybody that comes here vote and get free welfare.
[01:37:29.536 --> 01:37:42.642]  They're going to send the Justice Department in to stir up the black community that's got some real issues, some real beefs, but at the same time they're selling race war as legitimate now, even in Time Magazine, saying it's part of a legitimate class struggle.
[01:37:43.422 --> 01:37:47.445]  While the ultra-rich fund the whole de-evolution of the country.
[01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:55.511]  Up on DrudgeReport.com, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, coming race war, won't be about race, but it is a race war.
[01:37:55.551 --> 01:38:00.115]  Jesse Jackson, booed after fundraising from the podium.
[01:38:01.856 --> 01:38:05.499]  Protester, if I've got to die tonight, I won't mind.
[01:38:05.519 --> 01:38:09.502]  57% of blacks in a poll think cop guilty of murder.
[01:38:10.142 --> 01:38:11.824]  Obama, to meet with Holder.
[01:38:13.095 --> 01:38:14.296]  Oh, to try to fix things.
[01:38:14.956 --> 01:38:20.938]  And the DOJ, the DOJ, Communists, New Black Panthers, hijacked Ferguson protest.
[01:38:21.419 --> 01:38:23.680]  That article is up on Infowars.com.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.701]  It's top-linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:34.905]  Missouri governor calls in troops, snubs White House, pot found in teen's body.
[01:38:35.825 --> 01:38:38.827]  I would imagine more than that was found according to eyewitness reports.
[01:38:38.847 --> 01:38:44.571]  He seemed like he was really crazed, especially in that video robbing the store.
[01:38:45.792 --> 01:38:51.336]  But again, that isn't why the cop was out basically originally making contact with him.
[01:38:52.697 --> 01:38:55.558]  There's going to be tragedies like this any way you slice it.
[01:38:56.659 --> 01:38:58.601]  So what's the larger issue here?
[01:38:59.901 --> 01:39:00.402]  It's the
[01:39:03.942 --> 01:39:05.003]  Time of crisis.
[01:39:05.203 --> 01:39:06.804]  It's the organized crises.
[01:39:06.924 --> 01:39:09.746]  It's the White House not letting a good crisis go to waste.
[01:39:09.766 --> 01:39:11.607]  You know, this came out on Friday.
[01:39:11.627 --> 01:39:16.551]  If folks want to see photos of the officer, Yahoo News covered it.
[01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:17.432]  Photos.
[01:39:17.512 --> 01:39:21.875]  Ferguson officer Darren Wilson earned police honor before fatal shooting.
[01:39:22.335 --> 01:39:29.320]  Patrolman's father recently sought prayers for a very challenging family situation.
[01:39:34.246 --> 01:39:40.732]  Six months before he shot and killed an unarmed teenager, police officer Darren Wilson earned a commendation for his extraordinary effort in the line of duty.
[01:39:40.752 --> 01:39:43.675]  Yahoo News confirmed the award through February 11th.
[01:39:44.035 --> 01:39:49.420]  Ferguson City Council meeting minutes and photos Wilson's father posted to his Facebook page.
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:54.605]  Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson, on receiving a commendation from his police department.
[01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:57.131]  John Wilson wrote on February 11th.
[01:39:57.451 --> 01:39:58.531]  Congratulations, son.
[01:39:59.031 --> 01:40:04.033]  One image shows Wilson shaking hands and receiving the commendation from Ferguson Police Chief Jackson.
[01:40:04.353 --> 01:40:10.655]  In a second photo, the tall and slender Wilson brandishes a smile as he returns to his seat.
[01:40:10.675 --> 01:40:14.736]  28-year-old officer.
[01:40:17.217 --> 01:40:20.758]  What he did to earn the commendation is not immediately known.
[01:40:24.304 --> 01:40:27.205]  So, trying to figure out exactly what's going on with all this.
[01:40:27.726 --> 01:40:45.094]  While IS runs around murdering Christians all over the Middle East, while the dollar devalues, while a new hoax is put out that Russia invaded with armored vehicles and they all got blown up with no photos or videos, and now it's basically admitted to be a total hoax, stuff is getting crazy.
[01:40:45.154 --> 01:40:51.437]  And the last thing we need is a bunch of destabilization to give the system a pretext to come down everybody.
[01:40:52.298 --> 01:40:58.363]  I'm going to go back to Tom, then Chris, Michael, John, Alex, and others that are patiently holding here today.
[01:40:59.123 --> 01:41:03.767]  I do want to focus in next hour on some of the news we haven't covered.
[01:41:03.807 --> 01:41:05.828]  Fritz Springmeier will be with us for 30 minutes.
[01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:13.214]  An author, researcher, lecturer dealing on what makes the globalists tick, what their mindsets are.
[01:41:13.554 --> 01:41:20.440]  And then I had a chance to sit down with Joe Rogan for probably 45 minutes, Saturday, when he was here in town.
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:21.861]  It's a video interview.
[01:41:23.257 --> 01:41:32.900]  I'm gonna air about six, seven minutes of that exclusively here with the host of UFC, well-known movie star, host of Fear Factor, and scores of other shows.
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:38.942]  We had a really good talk, one of the best interviews I've ever done with Joe, and I've been interviewing Joe since 99.
[01:41:38.982 --> 01:41:39.582]  I've known him since 98.
[01:41:40.382 --> 01:41:41.703]  We've become good friends over the years.
[01:41:42.703 --> 01:41:44.204]  And he just becomes more and more popular.
[01:41:44.224 --> 01:41:50.168]  In fact, he has about the most popular podcast out there for just general topics.
[01:41:50.688 --> 01:41:56.853]  We have the most popular political, but he has one of the most popular, not the most popular, in general topics as video podcast.
[01:41:56.913 --> 01:41:59.074]  And he's definitely a cultural phenomenon.
[01:41:59.474 --> 01:42:03.057]  Shells out 10,000-person arenas all over the United States.
[01:42:03.077 --> 01:42:04.938]  He's got a new comedy special coming out.
[01:42:05.739 --> 01:42:07.840]  And we're going to go hunting soon.
[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:08.600]  He's going to come to Texas.
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:09.881]  We're going to go hunting and videotape it.
[01:42:10.382 --> 01:42:11.402]  He was saying he wants to do that.
[01:42:12.743 --> 01:42:13.943]  He said, when are you coming to L.A.
[01:42:13.963 --> 01:42:14.964]  to be on my podcast?
[01:42:16.064 --> 01:42:16.504]  Someday.
[01:42:16.644 --> 01:42:17.684]  I just never go to L.A.
[01:42:17.724 --> 01:42:18.444]  as everybody knows.
[01:42:19.145 --> 01:42:21.065]  But it was good to see Joe.
[01:42:21.565 --> 01:42:25.066]  In a few days we'll air the whole interview at the end of the Nightly News.
[01:42:25.086 --> 01:42:33.308]  But we'll air part of that today where he talks about Ferguson, he talks about the police state, he talks about Obama, he talks about how he knew Robin Williams.
[01:42:33.988 --> 01:42:35.409]  Robin Williams was a fan of Joe Rogan.
[01:42:35.809 --> 01:42:38.149]  So that is coming up as well today.
[01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:41.190]  I want to go to London, England, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:42:42.526 --> 01:42:52.359]  ...has been watching this from afar, looking at how they have been using the riots in England a few years ago to bring in draconian controls against everyone as well.
[01:42:53.885 --> 01:43:12.489]  Paul, it's very hard to get people to pull outside the controlled political spectrum and see it from outside the box, but I want to get your expert analysis of this and the research you're doing, the video clips you have, the eyewitnesses, including elected black leaders in the area who are saying that this is provocateured.
[01:43:12.949 --> 01:43:17.771]  They were the same leaders who said last week Ferguson police stood down.
[01:43:18.091 --> 01:43:20.591]  That's now been confirmed by the state police.
[01:43:21.371 --> 01:43:23.172]  So these are some pretty credible people.
[01:43:25.097 --> 01:43:34.601]  That are saying that there are provocateurs working for people that we know work for the Justice Department, throwing things at the police and now gunshots.
[01:43:34.701 --> 01:43:36.642]  Someone shot at the police last night.
[01:43:38.002 --> 01:43:39.843]  Someone shot at their helicopter last week.
[01:43:41.004 --> 01:43:47.926]  And then the police go into animal mode and start shooting reporters with rubber bullets, just shooting anyone they can, you know, shoot.
[01:43:48.687 --> 01:43:50.147]  This is a recipe for disaster.
[01:43:50.447 --> 01:43:52.348]  Paul Joseph Watson, thank you for joining us.
[01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.969]  Good to be here, Alex.
[01:43:55.182 --> 01:43:55.742]  Get into it.
[01:43:55.762 --> 01:43:56.723]  What's your view on this?
[01:43:56.803 --> 01:44:07.132]  And break down your story that's top-linked on DrugsReport.com, dealing with the DOJ, Communists, and New Black Panthers hijack Ferguson protest.
[01:44:07.532 --> 01:44:09.714]  Leader of militant group pictured coordinating with police.
[01:44:11.155 --> 01:44:17.676]  Well, it's a shame that that's top-linked on Drudge in a way, Alex, because we've got an even bigger story that's probably going to be up by the end of the show.
[01:44:18.477 --> 01:44:26.278]  Of course, we've been talking about riots, preparations for civil unrest, literally, I mean, you've been doing it for over ten years, police state documentaries.
[01:44:26.318 --> 01:44:36.981]  We've been doing it intensively over the past several months, including just a month ago with the article you mentioned earlier about preparing for black Americans, preparing to arrest them and turn them.
[01:44:37.601 --> 01:44:38.881]  But this is a new document
[01:44:39.907 --> 01:44:45.529]  And the headline that I've gone with is, US Army preparing for quote, full-scale riots in US.
[01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:49.031]  And we've had these kind of document releases before.
[01:44:49.111 --> 01:44:53.912]  Normally they take two years from the point where they're written to the point where they actually become public.
[01:44:54.273 --> 01:44:55.353]  But this one's recent.
[01:44:55.573 --> 01:44:59.014]  It's just from April 21st, Department of the Army, 2014.
[01:44:59.054 --> 01:45:00.235]  It's called Civil Disturbances.
[01:45:03.476 --> 01:45:11.881]  And it basically gets into how they're preparing for full-scale riots in CONUS within the continental United States.
[01:45:12.362 --> 01:45:17.585]  They talk about demonstrations, protests, they talk about anti-WTO protests.
[01:45:18.325 --> 01:45:28.712]  They talk about ethnic hatred, civil unrest from urban situations that arise out of highly emotional social and economic issues.
[01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:34.453]  The most shocking aspect of it is they are talking about lethal response.
[01:45:34.493 --> 01:45:41.018]  There's a part in the document which is entitled lethal response for crowd control, sniper response.
[01:45:41.078 --> 01:45:45.401]  Remember this is both outside and within the United States.
[01:45:45.421 --> 01:45:55.208]  And it says sniper response ensure that target leaders or troublemakers are targeted, exploit the psychological effects of an attack.
[01:45:56.192 --> 01:46:03.678]  They talk about escalate gradually, starting with a small caliber single round and work up to a large caliber automatic.
[01:46:04.379 --> 01:46:09.643]  And this is targeting quote, unarmed civilians within the United States.
[01:46:09.663 --> 01:46:11.004]  Okay, so here's the headline.
[01:46:11.104 --> 01:46:14.107]  Army prepares to shoot and kill unarmed civilians.
[01:46:14.167 --> 01:46:15.368]  This is Nazi Germany.
[01:46:15.848 --> 01:46:17.590]  And when did this document come out, Paul?
[01:46:19.082 --> 01:46:21.304]  It came out publicly two days ago.
[01:46:21.764 --> 01:46:23.285]  It's been on the internet for two days.
[01:46:24.205 --> 01:46:34.853]  So it's an update to civil disturbances 3-39.33 that we got two years ago that Drudge linked to, where they were training the processes into the camps via our social security numbers.
[01:46:35.273 --> 01:46:38.035]  This is what I see happening, Paul, and I've been saying it for months intensely.
[01:46:38.755 --> 01:46:56.027]  Again, they sell the public on martial law because cities are burning, but then the main training is for the Tea Party and gun owners, and the next phase, the gun confiscation begins on a nationwide basis like Katrina, civil war breaks out, and the police and military are already honed and ready to follow orders.
[01:46:56.487 --> 01:47:02.692]  That's why the city, who's been training with the military, remember two years ago, they're all around St.
[01:47:03.152 --> 01:47:03.512]  Louis,
[01:47:04.733 --> 01:47:13.357]  That's why they were targeting leaders and our reporters with the 223s and aiming at them, because this was obviously federal training to decapitate the press.
[01:47:13.457 --> 01:47:14.517]  My God, Paul!
[01:47:14.837 --> 01:47:18.339]  And you're saying in the document they talk about shooting unarmed Americans?
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:27.923]  Yeah, I mean that's, it's lethal response for crowd control and it's within the United States against, quote, unarmed civilians.
[01:47:27.943 --> 01:47:30.224]  That is an unprecedented statement.
[01:47:30.264 --> 01:47:31.565]  When is your article coming out?
[01:47:31.725 --> 01:47:32.405]  I am blown away.
[01:47:33.297 --> 01:47:53.622]  Uh, I'll try and get it up before the end of the show, but they've also got a diagram of the human body, and they talk about deadly force final target areas, and they basically highlight the back of the neck, the head, the heart, and the spine as the key target areas which will induce unconsciousness, serious bodily injury, shock, or death.
[01:47:54.992 --> 01:47:59.356]  From the snipers, from the high caliber weapons that they talk about earlier in the document.
[01:47:59.376 --> 01:48:07.684]  Well, this is treason, ladies and gentlemen, because again, it'll all look reasonable when the cities are burning, as I've said a thousand times, literally, but it's all scripted.
[01:48:08.285 --> 01:48:11.828]  And then we're all supposed to just play along with the giant scripted event.
[01:48:12.128 --> 01:48:14.751]  Paul, is there any way in your view to avert this?
[01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:21.590]  If they continue to push it, I mean, it's coming to a head, isn't it?
[01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:35.293]  In fact, what's funny about this document is it says that, let me get the exact quote... Oh my God, I just found chapter 3, 3-13, on how to kill unarmed US citizens targeting the spine and the heart.
[01:48:35.913 --> 01:48:37.373]  I mean, this is... Exactly, it's shocking.
[01:48:37.494 --> 01:48:39.234]  Escalation of trauma chart.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:47.053]  Yeah, and they show the human body, the key areas that they would need to hit in order to basically kill people.
[01:48:47.414 --> 01:48:50.000]  And again, you know... They also say target the genitals.
[01:48:50.181 --> 01:48:50.962]  That's good, go ahead.
[01:48:53.305 --> 01:48:54.105]  We talked about it.
[01:48:54.525 --> 01:49:11.830]  When the 2010 document, which came out two years later, got released, there was this huge wave of denial from people saying, this is for foreign occupation, this is not domestic, even though they said over and over again, CONUS, within the continental United States, yes, it's also for outside.
[01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:14.651]  But it's also for inside the United States.
[01:49:14.671 --> 01:49:21.395]  So, just to get ahead of that expected denial, it says it's for domestic as well as foreign occupation.
[01:49:21.875 --> 01:49:36.183]  And they talk about how Posse Comitatus and the Constitution of the United States does not apply, that's the quote, under the exception where the right of the US government to ensure the preservation of public order and carrying out governmental operations
[01:49:36.363 --> 01:49:37.684]  I am just speechless at this point.
[01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:40.665]  I knew when I went in 99 to Marine Corps training
[01:49:58.655 --> 01:50:01.136]  Urban warfare operations in San Francisco and Oakland.
[01:50:01.636 --> 01:50:05.218]  They were training to confiscate guns and training to execute patriots.
[01:50:06.058 --> 01:50:12.901]  But then they would parade black people around in front of the news cameras and say, oh, it's for inner city people using underlying racism.
[01:50:13.161 --> 01:50:14.982]  But then the real training was for patriots.
[01:50:15.322 --> 01:50:17.003]  And I learned that from police chiefs and others.
[01:50:17.503 --> 01:50:20.905]  So now we see a long term plan that they've had since Clinton.
[01:50:21.405 --> 01:50:40.095]  Preparing to go operational, there's got to be some way to stop this, Paul, because once the military starts a civil war with the patriots, because first it'll be against the, quote, minorities, it'll be ordered by the Democrats to go out and burn in riot, but then they'll subside, then the real war starts against the patriots.
[01:50:41.633 --> 01:50:43.295]  This is a total nightmare, Paul.
[01:50:43.335 --> 01:50:44.636]  You can see the master plan.
[01:50:44.876 --> 01:50:45.977]  I'm skipping this network break.
[01:50:46.017 --> 01:50:46.618]  It's so important.
[01:50:47.198 --> 01:50:48.359]  I'm skipping this network break.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:50.421]  Paul, I am just speechless right now.
[01:50:50.882 --> 01:50:52.003]  And I'm also speechless.
[01:50:52.203 --> 01:50:52.904]  I'm not bragging.
[01:50:52.944 --> 01:50:56.147]  It's so scary that we have accurately, and no one else has,
[01:50:57.754 --> 01:51:03.678]  Literally predicted the entire paradigm and actually figured out what they would pull.
[01:51:04.179 --> 01:51:13.305]  And for those that don't understand, they're going to come after the Liberty Movement claiming that we will start blowing up federal facilities or attacking minority groups.
[01:51:14.046 --> 01:51:18.889]  So they'll use the race war as the pretext to come in as the referee.
[01:51:19.890 --> 01:51:21.871]  And again, the military and the police, they're in the middle of it too.
[01:51:21.891 --> 01:51:23.252]  They're compartmentalized just like we are.
[01:51:23.713 --> 01:51:25.354]  They will then stage false flags
[01:51:26.738 --> 01:51:35.484]  To blame it on the Liberty Movement, that will escalate the rioting, and then the answer will be, take out the leaders, and they will literally arrest me, Ron Paul, Ted Cruz.
[01:51:35.964 --> 01:51:39.686]  Rick Perry's already going to jail today, or tomorrow he's got to go to jail.
[01:51:40.447 --> 01:51:42.308]  I mean, we're all just going to go to jail.
[01:51:43.529 --> 01:51:45.990]  And by the way, I'm not joking about this.
[01:51:46.090 --> 01:51:47.671]  People say, well I thought you don't like Rick Perry.
[01:51:48.752 --> 01:51:50.233]  Rick Perry was a Democrat before.
[01:51:51.034 --> 01:51:55.917]  Rick Perry talks a lot of good talk, but waffles, but compared to Obama, I mean, he's not bad.
[01:51:57.418 --> 01:51:58.019]  It doesn't matter.
[01:51:58.119 --> 01:52:11.931]  If Republicans were arresting innocent Democrats, filmmakers, they were going into Democrat churches and taking their 501c3s, if the Republicans were involved in a political purge of Republicans or Democrats, I would come out against it.
[01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:21.981]  So, there's the backdrop of Dinesh D'Souza getting arrested, the IRS going after pro-life groups, MSNBC saying, of course we're going after you, you're racist.
[01:52:23.596 --> 01:52:26.557]  MSNBC saying I'm behind the Boston bombing with no proof?
[01:52:26.897 --> 01:52:28.757]  They crossed a Rubicon, folks.
[01:52:29.217 --> 01:52:33.158]  It means they've been given authorizations to lose lawsuits.
[01:52:34.118 --> 01:52:38.359]  It means that they know a future's coming where lawsuits won't matter.
[01:52:39.059 --> 01:52:42.880]  They've taken off the gloves, they've put battle axes in their hands.
[01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:45.500]  They're not just taking gloves off, folks.
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:50.321]  They are a criminal group taking over, and that's why so many Republican leaders
[01:52:51.195 --> 01:52:53.298]  Go, sure, you can put our troops under U.N.
[01:52:53.318 --> 01:52:53.698]  control.
[01:52:53.998 --> 01:52:58.364]  Sure, you can open the borders up if you want to without even an executive order.
[01:52:59.085 --> 01:53:04.792]  Sure, you can do whatever you want because they're going for broke and they've decided to go along with it.
[01:53:04.832 --> 01:53:05.653]  They're being blackmailed.
[01:53:07.435 --> 01:53:08.736]  We have predicted all of this.
[01:53:09.216 --> 01:53:10.476]  We have covered all of this.
[01:53:11.357 --> 01:53:14.338]  Undoubtedly, this is them preparing to move.
[01:53:14.418 --> 01:53:15.658]  We may be able to back them off.
[01:53:16.118 --> 01:53:17.419]  Cooler heads may prevail.
[01:53:18.019 --> 01:53:20.400]  But I gotta tell you, the general public's so ignorant.
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:26.623]  A lot of these welfare queens are so arrogant and they're so racially hateful.
[01:53:26.923 --> 01:53:27.743]  They just love it.
[01:53:27.763 --> 01:53:29.264]  They're walking right into a trap.
[01:53:30.024 --> 01:53:32.385]  Do you have any idea how to turn this around, Paul Watson?
[01:53:33.857 --> 01:53:39.879]  I think the only hope is to reach out to people within the police, the National Guard and the military.
[01:53:40.159 --> 01:54:00.426]  Similar to, you know, the wave of police brutality has had the effect of making some police wake up to the fact that people's constitutional rights need to be respected, which is why we see more and more examples of, you know, when people are out filming the police, some of those officers come up and say, no, I totally understand, you've got a right to film the police, I've got no problem with that.
[01:54:00.866 --> 01:54:04.852]  Because of the videos they've seen on YouTube about people getting harassed for it.
[01:54:05.333 --> 01:54:11.822]  So I think the more exposed this information becomes, the more that people within the police and the military will wake up to it.
[01:54:11.862 --> 01:54:15.548]  And that will obviously have an effect on their own individual behaviour and the choices they make.
[01:54:16.308 --> 01:54:19.471]  But you were talking earlier about how this is being applied domestically.
[01:54:19.511 --> 01:54:30.741]  Remember, Concord City, New Hampshire, when they applied for the grant for the armoured Bearcat vehicle last year, the police chief specifically said that it was needed to, quote,
[01:54:31.842 --> 01:54:41.992]  That's right, they mix Libertarians and Tea Partiers in with Al Qaeda, you name it.
[01:54:42.352 --> 01:54:51.642]  That's because the main training, the Justice Department has said, is for returning veterans, Christians, gun owners, Libertarians, mainline conservatives, constitutionalists.
[01:54:52.677 --> 01:54:54.760]  We're not telling people this in a vacuum.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:55:02.509]  You know, Joe Rogan said to me, he goes, I can't believe 15, 16 years ago, you told me the NSA was spying on me, how they were doing it.
[01:55:03.049 --> 01:55:06.273]  You told me they were preparing for martial law and now it's all coming true.
[01:55:06.293 --> 01:55:08.135]  You know, you must have a crystal ball.
[01:55:08.175 --> 01:55:09.056]  And I said, no, Joe.
[01:55:10.424 --> 01:55:11.864]  I've got the documents.
[01:55:12.284 --> 01:55:16.405]  It's all in the RAND Corporation National Stabilization Force Plan.
[01:55:16.845 --> 01:55:24.967]  And the point is, the globalists engineer the destabilization to then sell the takeover.
[01:55:25.227 --> 01:55:32.789]  Just like they ship the drugs in to destabilize the country as a pretext to take control of the society.
[01:55:35.166 --> 01:55:47.837]  It goes as far back as the 80s, doesn't it Alex, with Rex 84, because they were talking about locking people up who were considered national security threats, that was a quote, under the auspices of a national emergency.
[01:55:48.477 --> 01:55:59.407]  US Army War College 2008 warned the United States may experience massive civil unrest in the wake of a series of crises which it termed strategic shock, and that's in relation to an economic collapse, which again
[01:55:59.867 --> 01:56:02.548]  People are talking about another economic collapse in the works.
[01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:04.749]  So it's not as if this is a secret.
[01:56:04.829 --> 01:56:10.232]  Sometimes it takes a couple of years for the documents to be released, but we're merely quoting from the documents.
[01:56:10.732 --> 01:56:13.073]  And then we see events like Ferguson unfold.
[01:56:13.113 --> 01:56:15.114]  So, yeah, we don't have a crystal ball.
[01:56:15.134 --> 01:56:18.216]  We're just paying attention to what the government's doing behind the scenes.
[01:56:18.876 --> 01:56:22.117]  And let's not forget, they're not preparing for contingencies.
[01:56:22.137 --> 01:56:26.940]  They're saying this will happen while the border is completely wide open.
[01:56:27.987 --> 01:56:41.136]  And we'll all have this big distraction now of more demonstrations, riots, looting, as the most unsavory elements of thug life show up now, the MTV culture.
[01:56:42.349 --> 01:56:49.535]  With all their liberal fellow travelers to promote the rioting and looting, this is just a disaster upon a disaster.
[01:56:49.955 --> 01:57:01.685]  We all got a taste for the Washington Post reporter being arrested, our reporters peacefully out there being attacked, of what the police are ready to do, playing right into the hands of this whole disaster.
[01:57:02.145 --> 01:57:05.448]  And this is all so the globalists can rob the country blind.
[01:57:05.828 --> 01:57:08.690]  Paul Watson, I'm gonna let you go so you can get that report up.
[01:57:09.891 --> 01:57:11.873]  If you can get it done by overdrive,
[01:57:13.584 --> 01:57:15.530]  I can hardly even broadcast right now, folks.
[01:57:15.570 --> 01:57:16.473]  This is so epic.
[01:57:17.035 --> 01:57:18.078]  This is so huge.
[01:57:19.673 --> 01:57:27.017]  Try to get your article out by the end so I can have you on for another 15-20 minutes of overdrive, so that we have a special report to show the document and go over it for people.
[01:57:27.498 --> 01:57:28.738]  I'm going to let you go, Paul.
[01:57:28.778 --> 01:57:31.380]  Get your basic report up right now.
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:43.427]  Put in there how we predicted it, my video from July 17th, where I said they're going to stage race riots, bring in martial law that way, stage the terror attacks, blame it on the Tea Party, and then they're going to try to come after me and others.
[01:57:43.567 --> 01:57:44.748]  And I just am so sick of it.
[01:57:45.168 --> 01:57:46.709]  I appreciate you, Paul.
[01:57:47.409 --> 01:57:48.070]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[01:57:53.114 --> 01:57:53.894]  It's like a marathon.
[01:57:53.934 --> 01:57:55.455]  I've been doing this 19 years.
[01:57:56.876 --> 01:58:01.277]  And I've had special forces try to set fires and blame them on me in Florida.
[01:58:02.138 --> 01:58:04.799]  I've had so much stuff, I won't even get into all the stuff I've seen.
[01:58:06.621 --> 01:58:08.923]  It's just the public has no idea how much danger we're in.
[01:58:08.963 --> 01:58:09.664]  This is real.
[01:58:09.704 --> 01:58:16.389]  And I hope all the people at Salon and the Huffington Post and all you guys that make jokes about this and, you know, Alex Jones, ha ha ha.
[01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:17.490]  Look, it's all true.
[01:58:17.650 --> 01:58:20.953]  The NSA spying, the cancer viruses and the vaccines, all of it.
[01:58:21.273 --> 01:58:22.394]  I know a lot of you know this.
[01:58:22.434 --> 01:58:24.436]  You plan on the authoritarian takeover.
[01:58:25.177 --> 01:58:26.558]  You're actually just purely evil people.
[01:58:26.878 --> 01:58:27.819]  But a lot of you aren't.
[01:58:28.259 --> 01:58:30.441]  You're trendy liberals that got hired to be part of this.
[01:58:30.721 --> 01:58:31.602]  You've gone along with it.
[01:58:31.862 --> 01:58:33.764]  You do not want to go along with this, okay?
[01:58:33.824 --> 01:58:34.565]  I'm warning you.
[01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:36.471]  This is so dangerous.
[01:58:37.472 --> 01:58:38.373]  This is so evil.
[01:58:38.953 --> 01:58:39.854]  This is so bad.
[01:58:41.275 --> 01:58:42.776]  We've got to stop the Civil War.
[01:58:44.178 --> 01:58:45.158]  I'll tell the police too.
[01:58:45.619 --> 01:58:48.261]  I think 300,000 of you are going to get killed doing this, conservatively.
[01:58:59.477 --> 01:59:03.219]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[01:59:03.319 --> 01:59:04.479]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[01:59:04.559 --> 01:59:05.660]  God knows what's in this.
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:09.982]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:59:10.122 --> 01:59:15.905]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:59:16.045 --> 01:59:17.045]  That one is better.
[01:59:17.085 --> 01:59:18.066]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:59:18.346 --> 01:59:19.767]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[01:59:19.787 --> 01:59:20.287]  It's good water.
[01:59:20.407 --> 01:59:26.151]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:59:26.392 --> 01:59:33.437]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[01:59:33.617 --> 01:59:36.139]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:59:36.339 --> 01:59:44.245]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:59:44.405 --> 01:59:45.406]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:59:45.446 --> 01:59:46.427]  It's good water.
[01:59:46.607 --> 01:59:47.068]  Refreshing.
[01:59:47.088 --> 01:59:47.548]  It's good!

[02:00:20.130 --> 02:00:20.911]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.711 --> 02:00:22.592]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.252 --> 02:00:26.915]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.435 --> 02:00:31.538]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.758 --> 02:00:36.541]  Alright, Tom, Chris, Alex, Michael, John, we'll get to all of you.
[02:00:36.561 --> 02:00:38.022]  We've got guests coming up, obviously.
[02:00:39.474 --> 02:00:42.695]  Doesn't do justice to Fritz Springmeier to have a mom and all this is going on.
[02:00:42.736 --> 02:00:43.676]  Talk about the Illuminati.
[02:00:44.636 --> 02:00:50.959]  We'll get a quick update from him and then I promise to have him up for an hour whenever this rioting craziness ends.
[02:00:51.159 --> 02:00:52.540]  I have a feeling that it may not.
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:56.562]  This is part of the global destabilization we're witnessing right now.
[02:00:57.702 --> 02:01:00.824]  Tom in New York, you were finishing up a statement.
[02:01:00.864 --> 02:01:01.184]  Go ahead.
[02:01:02.421 --> 02:01:13.031]  Alex, I'm really trying to help you and everybody else involved with this so I'm going to slow down and we're going to take this real quick point by point because these are the most important points I think that have been made so far in all this.
[02:01:13.851 --> 02:01:21.999]  Again, getting back to what your second caller stated about somebody close to the officer's significant other calling in a St.
[02:01:22.019 --> 02:01:28.725]  Louis radio station last week giving a statement that was passed on to her which I personally myself cannot bet
[02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:44.428]  Does match up with eyewitness accounts during the shooting of Michael Brown that both put him exactly in the same position in the street, both for what was said to have occurred in the shooting that he was charging the officer in the exact distance.
[02:01:44.548 --> 02:01:49.230]  Now with these two people never having met, I cannot believe that this is only a coincidence.
[02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:54.433]  As well, the Ferguson Police Chief on Friday in his initial police conference
[02:01:55.109 --> 02:02:05.521]  Did give contradictory statements for anybody paying attention to that very specifically and I say that to anybody out there that is former law enforcement or still currently involved.
[02:02:06.002 --> 02:02:09.586]  You did hear the detailed timeline of the events that occurred at 1148.
[02:02:10.787 --> 02:02:14.572]  Darren Wilson was responding to a medical call for which he was cleared.
[02:02:15.052 --> 02:02:21.667]  Due to the ambulance arriving on the scene and his presence was no longer necessary at 11 51 the theft call came in between 11 51 and 11 54.
[02:02:26.405 --> 02:02:31.087]  The description of the suspect in the strong arm robbery was given over that radio.
[02:02:31.168 --> 02:02:37.751]  You cannot tell me from 1148 to 1154, Darren Wilson did not receive this information.
[02:02:38.511 --> 02:02:45.115]  So at some point upon his encounter with Michael Brown, he was aware of his status as a suspect.
[02:02:45.515 --> 02:02:53.079]  I highly doubt in the frame of mind that he was in, he was not still holding the box of Swisher Sweets, which going back to that,
[02:02:53.681 --> 02:02:55.183]  If you let me continue on this, please.
[02:02:55.243 --> 02:02:56.704]  It's a very important point.
[02:02:56.824 --> 02:02:59.607]  I used to work with anti-theft apprehension back in New York.
[02:03:00.888 --> 02:03:03.811]  Most thieves are usually criminals of opportunity.
[02:03:04.412 --> 02:03:14.001]  Being something petty in small time as this, if Mr. Brown in no way had any involvement with any form of narcotics in the system during this altercation,
[02:03:14.986 --> 02:03:21.010]  Then I do not believe he would have blatantly entered a store in broad daylight, gone over the counter, taking what he wanted.
[02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:23.831]  Sure, he was obviously bombed out of his brain when you watched the video.
[02:03:23.871 --> 02:03:27.774]  And they get Swisher Sweets, folks, get those to load them with the marijuana.
[02:03:27.814 --> 02:03:30.515]  That's the style of smoking it.
[02:03:31.476 --> 02:03:33.817]  Two or three of these, he grabbed an entire box.
[02:03:34.197 --> 02:03:34.558]  No, I know.
[02:03:34.718 --> 02:03:38.680]  That matches up with the statement given by the significant other's friend.
[02:03:39.722 --> 02:03:50.234]  Okay, so all these events leading up together, the police chief saying that they cannot be connected, this was after that midday lunch break they took later on in this afternoon press conference.
[02:03:50.254 --> 02:03:57.683]  Sure, sure, but look, look, look, the larger point I'm trying to get at here, I keep saying the issue, the issue, the issue, is that they're trying to start a race war
[02:03:58.544 --> 02:04:00.406]  Obama and the globalists want this.
[02:04:00.686 --> 02:04:02.728]  They've already made preparations for it.
[02:04:03.088 --> 02:04:04.169]  That's what I'm getting at.
[02:04:04.209 --> 02:04:10.374]  And they're going to then switch it and flip it onto the Tea Party because that's what the real training is for.
[02:04:10.814 --> 02:04:15.358]  Nine times out of ten, they are training to take on American gun owners.
[02:04:15.678 --> 02:04:19.221]  Can you imagine what that will look like for the police and military?
[02:04:19.942 --> 02:04:21.523]  Because I'll be right next to you in it.
[02:04:21.583 --> 02:04:22.964]  But the thing about it is this.
[02:04:23.105 --> 02:04:24.726]  We gotta nip this thing in the bud.
[02:04:25.234 --> 02:04:28.738]  And go back to the original incident that set all this off.
[02:04:29.178 --> 02:04:36.806]  And right now, another big thing I think that is being hugely overlooked in all this, you cannot tell me that the St.
[02:04:36.866 --> 02:04:44.814]  Louis Police Department, as well as the Medical Examiner's Office, has never collected forensic evidence or done an autopsy on a murder victim.
[02:04:45.387 --> 02:04:55.833]  Now, if the significant other story is correct, the gun was supposedly trying to be taken away from the officer inside the vehicle at his hip position.
[02:04:56.233 --> 02:05:07.019]  Now, Dorian, Michael Brown's friend, who I don't know what credibility you can give to him being involved in the robbery, one foot behind him and not considered an accomplice, said that he was
[02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:07.980]  I know, I hear you.
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:09.081]  I'll have to come back again.
[02:05:09.101 --> 02:05:09.641]  We got a guest.
[02:05:09.661 --> 02:05:12.443]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:12.564 --> 02:05:14.545]  The latest in preparedness is now here.

[02:05:35.683 --> 02:05:44.048]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:05:44.289 --> 02:05:46.230]  This is not a low-grade formula.

[02:06:10.066 --> 02:06:13.567]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:06:13.727 --> 02:06:17.688]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:06:18.009 --> 02:06:19.469]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:06:19.789 --> 02:06:27.371]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:06:27.652 --> 02:06:28.492]  But for how long?

[02:06:35.414 --> 02:06:38.235]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:06:40.188 --> 02:06:47.072]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[02:06:47.473 --> 02:06:54.797]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[02:07:09.785 --> 02:07:15.754]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:15.954 --> 02:07:20.160]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:25.087]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:25.487 --> 02:07:28.109]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:28.409 --> 02:07:33.592]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:33.853 --> 02:07:40.737]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:07:41.257 --> 02:07:45.020]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:50.163]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:50.503 --> 02:07:51.344]  This is innovating.
[02:07:51.624 --> 02:07:58.912]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:07:59.113 --> 02:08:03.157]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:08:15.157 --> 02:08:20.710]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:21.191 --> 02:08:23.737]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:37.768 --> 02:08:40.931]  All right, Fritz Springmeier is a best-selling author, researcher.
[02:08:40.951 --> 02:08:42.533]  He's been a political prisoner as well.
[02:08:42.953 --> 02:08:48.178]  Totally set up for exposing a lot of the bizarre rituals that the globalists are into.
[02:08:48.899 --> 02:08:53.523]  Exposing some of the stuff that goes on in England with all the child kidnapping and the rest of it.
[02:08:54.544 --> 02:09:21.025]  He's gonna be with us for about 15-20 minutes and I'll go back to your calls because this information is so important with Tom and Chris and Michael and John and Alex, former police, current police, National Guard folks, to talk about the Ferguson, Missouri situation that is clearly being stirred up by the Justice Department to then cause riots nationwide as a pretext to sell the public on troops and military on the street.
[02:09:21.786 --> 02:09:22.987]  It's all been premeditated.
[02:09:24.111 --> 02:09:26.532]  And now more and more eyewitness accounts are coming out.
[02:09:26.552 --> 02:09:35.835]  I was just watching CNN saying indeed that Brown had charged the police officer and had tried to get his gun away.
[02:09:36.675 --> 02:09:37.735]  I don't know what the truth is.
[02:09:38.496 --> 02:09:46.858]  I know there's massive manipulation going on and I know that Paul Watson on-air broke last hour and will be joining us in overdrive next hour.
[02:09:49.519 --> 02:09:51.980]  The incredible information
[02:09:53.326 --> 02:10:01.793]  Absolutely over the top, ladies and gentlemen, that the new official Civil Unrest Army Manual has been declassified.
[02:10:01.833 --> 02:10:03.114]  It was written two years ago.
[02:10:04.695 --> 02:10:06.376]  They released it two days ago.
[02:10:07.277 --> 02:10:13.041]  And Paul Watson has an article detailing it coming out in less than an hour at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:13.782 --> 02:10:21.668]  And the Army goes further than ever and says, we are preparing to use lethal force against non-violent demonstrators.
[02:10:22.881 --> 02:10:23.782]  And how to kill U.S.
[02:10:23.802 --> 02:10:24.342]  citizens.
[02:10:25.363 --> 02:10:27.424]  It's an update from the document two years ago.
[02:10:27.464 --> 02:10:29.185]  It's the same document, they just update it.
[02:10:29.405 --> 02:10:30.006]  It's the manual.
[02:10:31.306 --> 02:10:36.410]  Where they talk about processing our social security numbers into the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[02:10:37.330 --> 02:10:37.911]  This is it.
[02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:44.475]  Now remember, the real training, 90 plus percent of it is for gun owners, veterans, Tea Party.
[02:10:46.018 --> 02:10:48.940]  And the Justice Department says, white people are the number one threat.
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:49.841]  I mean, so racial.
[02:10:50.181 --> 02:10:51.922]  Imagine if they said black people are the threat.
[02:10:52.283 --> 02:10:58.447]  So, separately, they're getting ready to target gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, gun owners, whatever.
[02:10:59.869 --> 02:11:00.709]  We harp on that.
[02:11:00.949 --> 02:11:02.050]  We're the folks that expose it.
[02:11:02.070 --> 02:11:02.751]  We're the experts.
[02:11:03.459 --> 02:11:05.120]  I only tell you that because we are the experts.
[02:11:05.261 --> 02:11:06.502]  I am the expert on this, okay?
[02:11:06.962 --> 02:11:10.205]  I learned about this 18 years ago because of insiders.
[02:11:10.525 --> 02:11:11.526]  I've been on it ever since.
[02:11:12.047 --> 02:11:13.088]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:11:13.468 --> 02:11:14.369]  It's coming to a head.
[02:11:14.689 --> 02:11:22.836]  This is the time to be praying, ladies and gentlemen, because they want to start a civil war in this country between gun owners, the police, the military.
[02:11:24.257 --> 02:11:28.581]  If that happens, a lot of police and military say, well, I won't be part of that.
[02:11:28.661 --> 02:11:29.162]  I believe you.
[02:11:31.138 --> 02:11:39.503]  The problem is they're going to stage such horrendous terror attacks and blame it on domestic groups that it will be a psy-op and I question your resolve.
[02:11:39.904 --> 02:11:42.405]  Look at Katrina and the gun confiscation under orders.
[02:11:43.746 --> 02:11:47.408]  Didn't go into the 8th Ward or 9th Ward where all the looting was going on.
[02:11:48.109 --> 02:11:53.372]  They went into the high and dry wealthy areas and took those guns and handcuffed those citizens and they never got them back.
[02:11:54.493 --> 02:11:59.136]  And when we were getting reports of it at the time from police officers that were listeners, by name,
[02:12:00.305 --> 02:12:02.886]  Lister said that isn't true in 2005.
[02:12:03.246 --> 02:12:04.246]  You're lying, Alex.
[02:12:05.046 --> 02:12:06.027]  It came out weeks later.
[02:12:07.147 --> 02:12:08.267]  All the guns will be taken.
[02:12:08.987 --> 02:12:10.548]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[02:12:11.548 --> 02:12:16.269]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs just got back late last night from St.
[02:12:16.289 --> 02:12:26.472]  Louis, Missouri, where he spent the last week in the combat zone, being hit by the rubber bullet, fresh off three weeks at the border and all the rest of the craziness down there.
[02:12:29.127 --> 02:12:35.332]  He's volunteering to turn right back around with a fresh group of reporters, Kit Daniels and Marcos Morales.
[02:12:35.392 --> 02:12:36.172]  Marcos is going, right?
[02:12:36.192 --> 02:12:36.673]  He's able to go?
[02:12:37.133 --> 02:12:38.574]  They're turning around in an hour.
[02:12:39.395 --> 02:12:40.375]  They gotta leave in 20 minutes.
[02:12:40.696 --> 02:12:41.416]  They're getting on an airplane.
[02:12:41.436 --> 02:12:42.017]  They're going back.
[02:12:42.437 --> 02:12:45.159]  Fritz Springmeier will give us his overall big picture view on this.
[02:12:45.639 --> 02:12:47.220]  Talk some about Robin Williams' death.
[02:12:48.181 --> 02:12:50.062]  How many murders are going on in Hollywood?
[02:12:51.182 --> 02:12:55.683]  When a star, you know, no longer can make money as a star, they make money as a dead star.
[02:12:55.923 --> 02:12:56.783]  Could he have been killed?
[02:12:56.803 --> 02:12:58.604]  We're going to be talking about that briefly.
[02:12:58.624 --> 02:12:59.524]  I already had him scheduled.
[02:12:59.684 --> 02:13:04.726]  He'll be back with us as soon as this crisis is over in the next few weeks for a full hour via video Skype.
[02:13:04.826 --> 02:13:06.206]  We sell his book.
[02:13:06.246 --> 02:13:09.147]  We're the only people that do sell it because we put it back in print.
[02:13:09.727 --> 02:13:15.169]  Bloodlines of the Illuminati, the size of a phone book, which I used to think half of it was nuts.
[02:13:15.570 --> 02:13:20.572]  So much of it, after it was written 15 years ago, has come true, that it really is an important book to read.
[02:13:20.932 --> 02:13:22.813]  We have it at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:13:23.513 --> 02:13:27.475]  Everything's 10% off, by the way, until tomorrow at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:13:27.775 --> 02:13:29.375]  I should remind you, we are lister-supported.
[02:13:29.556 --> 02:13:31.396]  It's very expensive to send reporters up there.
[02:13:31.696 --> 02:13:35.178]  But Joe, I wanted to spend a few minutes with you before you turn around and leave.
[02:13:35.458 --> 02:13:36.479]  You're in studio with us.
[02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:41.650]  Man, you look... I mean, I saw you just a week and a half ago.
[02:13:41.710 --> 02:13:43.851]  You didn't look as jacked as you do right now.
[02:13:44.532 --> 02:13:45.032]  What's happened?
[02:13:45.052 --> 02:13:46.753]  Have you gotten back in combat mode or something?
[02:13:47.193 --> 02:13:50.294]  Well, honestly, I take the super male vitality as well.
[02:13:50.335 --> 02:13:54.717]  I mean, I'll hop in all these fences with these MRAPs chasing me and lasers pointed at my chest.
[02:13:54.757 --> 02:13:55.177]  It makes you...
[02:13:55.797 --> 02:13:56.477]  Get amped up.
[02:13:56.517 --> 02:14:12.044]  I mean, I'm telling you, I'm out there running lives or you streaming trying to get everything because the only way people in America are going to wake up to what's really going on and what can happen in their neighborhood is actually see what's going on and not watch what CNN and Fox and all these guys are telling you from the roped off little sheet pins that they have.
[02:14:12.444 --> 02:14:12.965]  It's ridiculous.
[02:14:12.985 --> 02:14:20.688]  The only way that the Americans are actually see what's going to happen is if we continue to get out there on the front lines and watch both sides of this collapse.
[02:14:20.868 --> 02:14:23.689]  Well, it was thugs at first, then it was good people for a few days.
[02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:25.710]  Now the thugs have descended.
[02:14:25.730 --> 02:14:27.331]  I mean, that's what I see from the outside.
[02:14:27.371 --> 02:14:27.971]  Is that accurate?
[02:14:28.231 --> 02:14:30.672]  Yeah, Saturday it was a whole different story.
[02:14:30.732 --> 02:14:32.052]  I was looking at... You were there for the looting?
[02:14:32.433 --> 02:14:35.014]  Yes, I was like, this is not going to be good.
[02:14:35.674 --> 02:14:39.235]  The protesters started turning on us, swatting the cameras at us.
[02:14:39.295 --> 02:14:41.116]  Josh got surrounded.
[02:14:41.196 --> 02:14:45.398]  One of the girls came out of the crowd and ran and tried to push my Ustream feed out of the way.
[02:14:45.418 --> 02:14:45.978]  Because you're white?
[02:14:46.872 --> 02:14:47.873]  Just because I was recording.
[02:14:47.913 --> 02:14:48.393]  Who knows?
[02:14:48.413 --> 02:14:49.193]  They just didn't want it.
[02:14:49.453 --> 02:14:51.595]  But it was funny because they're yelling for their amendments.
[02:14:51.615 --> 02:14:53.095]  They want to be able to say what they want to say.
[02:14:53.416 --> 02:14:56.137]  But then they started swatting at our cameras and saying that we couldn't film.
[02:14:56.837 --> 02:14:57.858]  Well, I've been watching the feeds.
[02:14:57.878 --> 02:14:59.179]  There's a lot of racist talk going on.
[02:14:59.319 --> 02:15:00.059]  Oh yeah, there's a lot.
[02:15:00.179 --> 02:15:02.580]  So before it was the locals saying we want our town back.
[02:15:03.041 --> 02:15:04.581]  You know, retired and hard-working black folks.
[02:15:05.082 --> 02:15:06.602]  It's kind of a retiree area is what I've read.
[02:15:06.622 --> 02:15:07.383]  Is that accurate?
[02:15:07.463 --> 02:15:09.044]  And now the thugs have showed up from St.
[02:15:09.064 --> 02:15:09.344]  Louis.
[02:15:09.624 --> 02:15:13.006]  Well, I would say like around 6 30, 7 o'clock at night.
[02:15:13.046 --> 02:15:14.807]  That's when the locals who live there.
[02:15:15.307 --> 02:15:19.070]  The families that actually work and have jobs and do everything, that's when they go to bed.
[02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:20.811]  They lock up, they're like, I don't want any part of this.
[02:15:20.851 --> 02:15:23.293]  You can see them coming out and grabbing their kids off the street.
[02:15:23.493 --> 02:15:34.102]  Then I see out-of-towners and people that come out doing donuts in the road, acting fools, screaming, driving up at the police, standing in front of the businesses trying to protect them, throwing stuff and saying, F the police.
[02:15:34.142 --> 02:15:37.324]  We don't have to do anything when you guys say, you got guns, we got guns.
[02:15:37.344 --> 02:15:39.366]  And they're sitting there with their mask on, jumping up and down.
[02:15:40.405 --> 02:15:43.987]  Does anybody have any idea what the globalists are doing?
[02:15:44.427 --> 02:15:52.012]  If this gets out of hand, then the military will crush them, that will start a larger race war, and then like Judo, they're going to flip it on to the Tea Party.
[02:15:52.432 --> 02:15:57.214]  Joe, you went to the secret training bases, we've got the video of them training to intern blacks en masse.
[02:15:57.755 --> 02:16:04.579]  We've been warning people since July when we figured out the combo, the combination of what they were planning, the final pieces.
[02:16:05.599 --> 02:16:07.840]  Have we not accurately predicted exactly what was going to happen?
[02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:09.080]  Exactly, it's happening now.
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:13.142]  And like you said earlier, the police aren't even stopping the looting.
[02:16:13.342 --> 02:16:14.863]  They allow it.
[02:16:15.363 --> 02:16:20.885]  They were letting these guys drive around the street recklessly, almost hitting crowds of people that were standing there praying.
[02:16:22.205 --> 02:16:28.628]  People hanging out the side of the vehicle with masks, throwing up gang signs, driving at crowds of people and the cops are just sitting there watching.
[02:16:29.308 --> 02:16:30.588]  And then they would leave the store.
[02:16:30.829 --> 02:16:34.390]  Well, the cops' argument is we try to run them off and you get mad at us.
[02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:41.183]  Yeah, but the only time it ever gets violent-violent is when they just line up and they just start shooting into the crowd.
[02:16:41.643 --> 02:16:46.866]  Well, I was about to say, obviously the police should swarm out against criminals, then they'd be cheered by the crowd.
[02:16:46.966 --> 02:16:52.409]  Guard the First Amendment, protect the press, go after people doing bad, then they'd be praised.
[02:16:52.470 --> 02:16:56.372]  But no, they've set up the training where it always goes bad like this.
[02:16:57.102 --> 02:16:59.785]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the one guy, we saw the one guy throw the bottle.
[02:16:59.885 --> 02:17:02.809]  Why not go get that one guy and then let the demonstration continue?
[02:17:03.169 --> 02:17:07.254]  What they did is they let that one bottle just be the flashpoint for everything.
[02:17:07.914 --> 02:17:11.659]  Sirens going off, smokes, flashbangs, and then just attacking people.
[02:17:11.939 --> 02:17:13.941]  Lining up, marching, and shooting into a crowd.
[02:17:14.662 --> 02:17:18.425]  Well, I've also seen some black leaders say that only blacks are being shot at with rubber bullets.
[02:17:18.485 --> 02:17:19.426]  Is that true?
[02:17:19.586 --> 02:17:20.787]  Negative, because I got shot.
[02:17:20.827 --> 02:17:22.348]  There was a white lady.
[02:17:22.368 --> 02:17:24.850]  She was a minister in the local town right there in Ferguson.
[02:17:25.251 --> 02:17:28.413]  She has a huge bruise that takes up her whole stomach.
[02:17:28.453 --> 02:17:29.454]  I mean, it was worse than mine.
[02:17:29.955 --> 02:17:32.136]  I mean, hers was actually ripped a little bit.
[02:17:32.316 --> 02:17:33.978]  But you told me they were clearly targeting the press.
[02:17:34.398 --> 02:17:35.679]  Oh, definitely.
[02:17:35.719 --> 02:17:38.001]  That's the first time in my own country I've really felt threatened.
[02:17:38.061 --> 02:17:40.263]  Well, they've never targeted press during riots.
[02:17:40.584 --> 02:17:44.848]  The police have always wanted the press there to cover what really happened, so they could show the rioters.
[02:17:44.988 --> 02:17:46.930]  But why in the world would they target you?
[02:17:47.350 --> 02:17:51.594]  Well, the scariest thing is when you hear them get on the radio and they say, turn off all recording equipment.
[02:17:52.054 --> 02:17:53.315]  That just blows my mind.
[02:17:53.996 --> 02:17:56.119]  And then the last one was Saturday.
[02:17:56.519 --> 02:18:03.287]  They said if you do not disperse the streets, we will arrest you and or by other means necessary.
[02:18:03.568 --> 02:18:04.829]  They added that on this time.
[02:18:05.250 --> 02:18:09.014]  So that's when the next following night shootings and all that.
[02:18:09.034 --> 02:18:10.736]  So they're now quoting Malcolm X.
[02:18:11.670 --> 02:18:12.831]  The police as they attack people.
[02:18:13.231 --> 02:18:17.495]  I mean, that's what's so crazy about this, is it's the worst possible combination.
[02:18:18.155 --> 02:18:19.116]  Well, listen, get out of here.
[02:18:19.256 --> 02:18:19.736]  Great job.
[02:18:19.757 --> 02:18:20.937]  Everybody will be praying for you, Joe.
[02:18:21.278 --> 02:18:22.439]  We really appreciate you.
[02:18:22.599 --> 02:18:26.602]  And last night, I predicted, I said, today or the next day, the National Guard will be called.
[02:18:26.622 --> 02:18:28.083]  When I landed, I talked to you.
[02:18:28.123 --> 02:18:31.166]  I said, I guarantee you the National Guard will be in play.
[02:18:31.426 --> 02:18:32.847]  And sure enough, here we are today.
[02:18:33.688 --> 02:18:34.748]  Well, get out there by tonight.
[02:18:34.789 --> 02:18:36.370]  But listen, I don't want you on the front lines anymore.
[02:18:37.421 --> 02:18:44.663]  You've done enough, and go buy, I told him yesterday, I don't know if we had the time, I didn't mean to send you, you need to get expensive gas masks.
[02:18:45.943 --> 02:18:48.704]  The ones I got worked fine, it's just Jakar didn't have his on his tights.
[02:18:49.204 --> 02:18:51.485]  But your eyes, you need them with the... Yeah, I need the goggles.
[02:18:52.765 --> 02:18:56.986]  And I just don't want you guys being heroes out there, alright?
[02:18:57.895 --> 02:18:58.796]  Just stand back.
[02:18:59.657 --> 02:18:59.997]  All right?
[02:19:00.217 --> 02:19:00.998]  I don't have that heavy.
[02:19:01.018 --> 02:19:02.299]  I know, but you're not allowed to get in trouble.
[02:19:02.559 --> 02:19:04.381]  Just come on, go cover it from the periphery.
[02:19:04.401 --> 02:19:04.641]  Oh, I am.
[02:19:04.701 --> 02:19:05.702]  I'm going to stay off to the side.
[02:19:05.722 --> 02:19:07.744]  That way I can see them converging on each other.
[02:19:07.764 --> 02:19:09.185]  So the sides are fine.
[02:19:09.205 --> 02:19:11.107]  It's usually if you're just in the middle of the road right there.
[02:19:11.407 --> 02:19:12.829]  That's where everything's being shot to.
[02:19:12.889 --> 02:19:19.395]  If I get back, like on some of those side businesses, like I was able to Saturday and kind of stay around the corner of the building and film out, I got good stuff.
[02:19:20.370 --> 02:19:22.892]  Now when the cops roll past you and you're doing that, are they doing anything to you now?
[02:19:23.133 --> 02:19:25.795]  They started pointing sniper rifles at me and me and Jakari had to run.
[02:19:25.835 --> 02:19:31.841]  We were chased for a little while and then I had to run five miles out of the city of Ferguson, come back around in the pouring rain.
[02:19:32.241 --> 02:19:34.043]  Well that's why it looks like you've lost 20 pounds.
[02:19:34.103 --> 02:19:34.283]  Yeah.
[02:19:34.764 --> 02:19:35.765]  There's been a lot of running.
[02:19:35.785 --> 02:19:38.567]  I was like, you walk in, I don't even recognize you.
[02:19:38.587 --> 02:19:40.649]  I mean you weren't fat but you were a little chubby like me.
[02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.909]  Yeah.
[02:19:41.090 --> 02:19:44.533]  I mean man, it's called the Ferguson workout secret.
[02:19:47.008 --> 02:19:48.649]  You look like 10 years younger, bro.
[02:19:49.129 --> 02:19:50.690]  It's been good for you, getting cast.
[02:19:51.470 --> 02:19:52.571]  You owe me for sending you.
[02:19:52.591 --> 02:19:54.712]  You have to pay me for the special work.
[02:19:54.772 --> 02:19:58.213]  I've been drinking like two bottles of water a day in like a granola bar.
[02:19:58.233 --> 02:19:58.794]  That's about it.
[02:19:58.814 --> 02:20:00.254]  Alright, well be safe.
[02:20:00.695 --> 02:20:02.175]  You guys, you know, force be with you.
[02:20:02.936 --> 02:20:08.418]  Viacon Dios, Joe Biggs, we're going to come back with our special guest, Fritz Springmeier, for an abbreviated interview.
[02:20:08.438 --> 02:20:09.459]  They'll be back with us next week.
[02:20:09.659 --> 02:20:14.923]  Recent events have shown just how vulnerable we are to deadly viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[02:20:15.143 --> 02:20:20.588]  These diseases are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[02:20:20.908 --> 02:20:24.751]  Now more than ever, there's a great need for a product that will help protect us.
[02:20:25.091 --> 02:20:25.952]  Look no further.
[02:20:26.332 --> 02:20:31.156]  Supernatural Silver can provide immune system support to help fight off these deadly pathogens.
[02:20:31.756 --> 02:20:42.539]  Supernatural silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that's safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast.
[02:20:42.899 --> 02:20:48.961]  Supernatural silver can be taken orally or used topically and can be used in a nebulizer or vaporizer for inhalation.
[02:20:49.161 --> 02:20:54.002]  With over 180 scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals and research institutes,
[02:20:54.022 --> 02:20:54.422]  We're good.
[02:21:09.019 --> 02:21:09.199]  Yeah.
[02:21:28.362 --> 02:21:28.702]  I think?
[02:21:48.029 --> 02:21:58.172]  Whether it's the Made in America apparel or the Produced in America high quality supplements, it's all 10% off the already lowest price in this back-to-school week.

[02:22:14.506 --> 02:22:15.587]  We need assistance.
[02:22:15.967 --> 02:22:16.508]  Please!
[02:22:16.788 --> 02:22:20.090]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[02:22:20.350 --> 02:22:26.455]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:22:26.755 --> 02:22:29.076]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[02:24:17.847 --> 02:24:18.567]  He's been there.
[02:24:18.587 --> 02:24:25.489]  A bunch of thugs came to town, just like the state police said, that are just attacking and burning and looting things, and it's disgusting.
[02:24:25.929 --> 02:24:29.329]  Almost running over prayer vigils.
[02:24:30.149 --> 02:24:32.450]  This is what the Democratic Party is promoting.
[02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:34.390]  Truly disgusting.
[02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:43.832]  Again, Fritz Springmeier, author of this phone book-sized book in my hand, Bloodlines the Illuminati, available only
[02:24:45.282 --> 02:24:46.483]  at infowarestore.com
[02:24:59.895 --> 02:25:01.676]  To be true and came out in mainstream media.
[02:25:02.177 --> 02:25:03.057]  It is bizarre.
[02:25:03.678 --> 02:25:07.701]  And I can't prove all of it, but a lot of it over the years has turned out to be accurate.
[02:25:07.861 --> 02:25:08.982]  Really amazing book.
[02:25:09.442 --> 02:25:15.587]  Available at m4store.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:25:15.727 --> 02:25:18.409]  I appreciate Fritz coming in today to do this via Skype.
[02:25:18.429 --> 02:25:19.250]  His Skype looks great.
[02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:22.351]  That's one reason I haven't had him on as much as his internet's been bad.
[02:25:22.691 --> 02:25:23.912]  But he looks like he's got good internet.
[02:25:23.932 --> 02:25:33.537]  So, Fritz, I want to invite you on to the nightly news the next few weeks and do a full hour in the near future with us here on the syndicated radio show.
[02:25:33.557 --> 02:25:38.859]  So we'll get that set up as soon as this Ferguson thing either escalates or downgrades.
[02:25:39.279 --> 02:25:43.361]  We're really trying to focus on this because it's part of a larger globalist plan.
[02:25:43.862 --> 02:25:46.063]  What is your gut watching this unfold?
[02:25:46.923 --> 02:25:48.166]  I mean, we have the evidence.
[02:25:48.206 --> 02:25:54.077]  They are provocateuring this and preparing race war as a pretext for martial law.
[02:25:54.698 --> 02:25:55.660]  What's your view on that?
[02:25:56.997 --> 02:26:08.243]  Well, first I want to comment that you're on top of it, and there's not a whole lot of information that I can give on the details of what's transpiring that you're not giving.
[02:26:08.564 --> 02:26:19.550]  You're doing a good job of covering it, but what I can do is give the larger context, because as you've been telling your audience, I did a lot of
[02:26:19.930 --> 02:26:22.451]  research on the Illuminati.
[02:26:23.251 --> 02:26:25.232]  This is a part of a program.
[02:26:26.073 --> 02:26:30.374]  There's programs and then there's sub-programs underneath that.
[02:26:31.115 --> 02:26:46.161]  And at the top of the agenda is population reduction, but they're also trying to break up the United States, take us back down to where we're manageable, split us up,
[02:26:46.761 --> 02:26:51.688]  We're gonna have order out of chaos, but first we've got to create the chaos.
[02:26:51.748 --> 02:27:00.880]  So two years ago when I was in studio with you, you were holding up and showing the audience my books on the trauma-based mind control.
[02:27:01.341 --> 02:27:02.062]  And when I did
[02:27:03.343 --> 02:27:06.846]  Work with the victims of this trauma-based mind control.
[02:27:06.866 --> 02:27:12.431]  I was trying to be a friend and a free therapist to them.
[02:27:13.191 --> 02:27:19.817]  I wasn't charging people for the help I gave and people came from around the world to my house to get assistance.
[02:27:19.937 --> 02:27:20.917]  One of the things that I
[02:27:21.698 --> 02:27:39.873]  Discovered, and this wasn't only just something I discovered, but some other Christian ministers that were also working with victims of trauma-based mind control also discovered this, is that all of these people have programming for this period of chaos, Armageddon programming, where
[02:27:40.513 --> 02:27:52.296]  The elite of the world, we're going to create Armageddon-type scenarios where we have these plagues, where we have these riots, we have this chaos, we have a financial crisis.
[02:27:53.797 --> 02:28:02.619]  You know, Christine Lagarde, who's head of the IMF, she's been talking about we need a global reset, structural reforms, there's all these
[02:28:03.159 --> 02:28:06.922]  The Rand Corporation says a global war is needed to save the New World Order.
[02:28:07.422 --> 02:28:14.547]  It's chaos psychology where you bring in the chaos to then get the public to beg for the solution.
[02:28:15.407 --> 02:28:16.148]  Exactly.
[02:28:16.448 --> 02:28:25.774]  And they're going to have people asking for, you know, we got this Ebola scare and now Monsanto's going to make billions of dollars off of
[02:28:26.795 --> 02:28:34.142]  You know, they create a problem, then they give the solution, and they make money through the whole Hegelian dialectic process.
[02:28:34.622 --> 02:28:48.596]  So, you know, the Department of Agriculture, Vilsack, was Monsanto, and Monsanto even gave him a jet to travel around as he was governor.
[02:28:49.016 --> 02:28:49.657]  So we've got
[02:28:50.157 --> 02:28:54.922]  We've got these Illuminati members salted in in our government.
[02:28:55.323 --> 02:28:59.527]  You know, John Kerry, who is Department of State, Skull and Bones.
[02:28:59.547 --> 02:29:06.335]  Skull and Bones set up as a branch of the Bavarian Illuminati, which was a branch of the Illuminati in general.
[02:29:06.815 --> 02:29:23.617]  So we got all these members, you've been watching this too, you know how so many members in a president's cabinet will be counsel on foreign relations, which was Illuminati controlled organization, so they put their people in, they programmed
[02:29:24.218 --> 02:29:27.941]  People all through all levels of society.
[02:29:28.422 --> 02:29:39.572]  So what we see happening at Ferguson, some of those people that are on both sides of the issue, some of the police, some of the demonstrators, some of these people coming from St.
[02:29:39.612 --> 02:29:43.495]  Louis to cause problems, these people have been programmed to do this.
[02:29:43.836 --> 02:29:47.979]  This is actually pretty intense, sophisticated mind control.
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:57.890]  Um, one of the things that I discovered in working with these Illuminati victims of mind control is even the people that supposedly are not... Hold on, I want to hear this.
[02:29:57.990 --> 02:30:00.473]  Stay there and then the phone calls are coming up.
[02:30:00.553 --> 02:30:02.215]  Chris will be on a whole hour next week.
[02:30:02.235 --> 02:30:03.256]  Just send him up next week, guys.
[02:30:03.276 --> 02:30:08.022]  We're gonna come back and I promise I'll go to Tom, Alex, Chris, John, and others.
[02:30:09.437 --> 02:30:13.159]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:30:13.279 --> 02:30:14.479]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[02:30:14.519 --> 02:30:15.600]  God knows what's in there.
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:19.922]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:30:20.062 --> 02:30:25.865]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:30:26.005 --> 02:30:26.985]  That one is better.
[02:30:27.065 --> 02:30:28.026]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:30:28.306 --> 02:30:29.727]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:30:29.767 --> 02:30:30.247]  It's good water.
[02:30:30.367 --> 02:30:36.108]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:43.390]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:30:43.570 --> 02:30:46.071]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:30:46.291 --> 02:30:54.213]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:30:54.353 --> 02:30:55.373]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:30:55.493 --> 02:30:56.374]  It's good water.
[02:30:56.574 --> 02:30:57.014]  Refreshing?
[02:30:57.034 --> 02:30:57.474]  It's good!

[02:32:38.860 --> 02:32:42.362]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:42.522 --> 02:32:46.485]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:46.785 --> 02:32:48.246]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:48.566 --> 02:32:56.151]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:33:25.709 --> 02:33:49.345]  I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in
[02:33:50.427 --> 02:33:52.008]  Don't want to be in your London dungeon.
[02:33:52.028 --> 02:33:55.991]  Don't want to be in your New World Order hell.
[02:33:59.793 --> 02:34:01.895]  They'd like to lock us up.
[02:34:03.235 --> 02:34:05.257]  Put us in their pretty pens.
[02:34:07.418 --> 02:34:09.820]  Look, television itself is brainwashing.
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:18.185]  When you tune in to every major cop show, every major cartoon, every major wartime video game, I'm not exaggerating.
[02:34:18.205 --> 02:34:19.046]  It's got to be everyone.
[02:34:20.009 --> 02:34:22.810]  Because listeners send us all the video clips of this stuff.
[02:34:23.891 --> 02:34:36.217]  I've seen in the last month probably five different video games that are out this year where you fight Tea Party people and gun owners and kill them because they're terrorists.
[02:34:37.317 --> 02:34:39.098]  I don't even hardly watch television or movies.
[02:34:39.498 --> 02:34:43.360]  And when I do, the bad guy loves the Second Amendment and George Washington.
[02:34:45.601 --> 02:34:46.842]  That's brainwashing!
[02:34:48.194 --> 02:34:52.740]  Earlier this year, in January, the Pentagon came out and said, we're going to stop lying because of Matt Drudge.
[02:34:53.341 --> 02:34:56.144]  So to stop lying, we're going to engage in PSYOPs domestically.
[02:34:56.505 --> 02:34:57.846]  And they changed the law so they could.
[02:34:57.887 --> 02:34:58.487]  That's the lie.
[02:34:58.728 --> 02:35:01.071]  We're going to stop lying by openly lying.
[02:35:04.301 --> 02:35:06.863]  And the military itself is more psy-op than anybody.
[02:35:06.883 --> 02:35:09.565]  That's why the military is the most awake group out there.
[02:35:10.026 --> 02:35:19.053]  Well, we've got to be careful about alienating them because they're the people that aren't ignorant like the public and do know they've been training for gun confiscation and do know all this is happening.
[02:35:19.233 --> 02:35:22.296]  We're going to go to your calls and give you the floor and move quickly to the next person.
[02:35:22.556 --> 02:35:24.618]  So I've had folks holding for an hour because a guest came on.
[02:35:25.258 --> 02:35:31.904]  After Fritz leaves us here in a moment, I'm going to go into overdrive with the Joe Rogan and more.
[02:35:33.578 --> 02:35:36.020]  But Fred, you're going to be on the Nightly News tomorrow night with 30 minutes.
[02:35:36.540 --> 02:35:37.801]  Next week on the radio for an hour.
[02:35:37.821 --> 02:35:41.483]  A lot of times people in news obviously move a guest if it's not on topic.
[02:35:41.803 --> 02:35:42.824]  You are on topic.
[02:35:43.224 --> 02:35:43.805]  It's important.
[02:35:43.845 --> 02:35:48.728]  I want to delve into these documents and discuss it, but the culture itself is brainwashing.
[02:35:49.068 --> 02:35:56.950]  The fluoride in the water to lower IQ and to make other drugs have a higher effect as an adjuvant, that's pharmakeia mind control.
[02:35:57.350 --> 02:36:04.592]  Putting 25 million kids on Ritalin, another 60 million on Prozac-type drugs, death education, increasing suicides.
[02:36:04.933 --> 02:36:09.074]  We're in a mind control culture where the president says 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:36:10.054 --> 02:36:11.918]  And if you built a business, you didn't build it!
[02:36:12.238 --> 02:36:16.146]  I mean, aren't we already basting in just general mind control?
[02:36:16.386 --> 02:36:19.112]  Fritz Springmeier, author of Bloodlines the Illuminati.
[02:36:20.034 --> 02:36:20.935]  Yes, exactly.
[02:36:21.135 --> 02:36:41.592]  And I wanted to finish my thought just when we took break, and that was, in a place like Ferguson, what they have done is, and this is going to happen repeatedly in the United States, when you have these riots and stuff, they have actually programmed people with this trauma-based mind control to become leaders of the rioters.
[02:36:41.992 --> 02:36:48.200]  They're people that have been taken and trained, certain parts of their minds, alters.
[02:36:48.961 --> 02:36:55.049]  You can see the type of programming I'm talking about if you watch this Charles Bronson movie, Telephone.
[02:36:55.951 --> 02:36:58.754]  And so these people can be triggered.
[02:36:59.535 --> 02:37:11.102]  And then they will go into their leadership mode where you have a crowd and they will take control of the crowd.
[02:37:11.142 --> 02:37:23.330]  So that's a little scary because if you're somebody who's sincerely protesting, the next thing you know you'll be caught up in a movement that's controlled by the elite and you won't even know it.
[02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:31.500]  The people that are taking control of the crowd, as well as the police, you've got this controlled chaos.
[02:37:32.321 --> 02:37:37.567]  And so, yeah, we're looking at some serious things coming down the pipe.
[02:37:37.627 --> 02:37:38.789]  You've been warning people.
[02:37:39.489 --> 02:37:46.674]  You've been talking about how our government is ready for the financial crisis and chaos.
[02:37:47.094 --> 02:37:49.296]  How they've stocked up on the weapons.
[02:37:50.817 --> 02:37:55.000]  So you're on top of it and I appreciate that you're warning people.
[02:37:55.921 --> 02:38:00.884]  This is definitely things that are on the Illuminati agenda.
[02:38:01.544 --> 02:38:04.687]  And then the long-range plans like I'm talking about.
[02:38:05.587 --> 02:38:26.599]  Are to take us down to population reduction so you can you can rest assured that after they stress us out with a number of things like a financial crisis then they will you know and the American dollar will be dethroned as the world's reserve currency then we will
[02:38:27.699 --> 02:38:30.621]  We will see the plagues come in.
[02:38:30.641 --> 02:38:38.385]  I think that this is just scaring people right now with the Ebola thing.
[02:38:38.986 --> 02:38:40.587]  I'm concerned.
[02:38:40.607 --> 02:38:40.787]  I agree.
[02:38:40.827 --> 02:38:47.851]  They're just getting everything in place, the compartmentalization, the preparation, while deindustrializing, posing as the saviors.
[02:38:49.438 --> 02:38:52.401]  And again, the average cop or military or bureaucrat doesn't even know.
[02:38:52.421 --> 02:38:55.623]  I mean, the globalists all have written that in public books.
[02:38:56.143 --> 02:39:01.628]  Tragedy and Hope, Brzezinski's books, Ecoscience, literally hundreds of books they've written.
[02:39:02.128 --> 02:39:08.493]  Men in Power is a political retrospective, written by the German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, all admitting how they do this.
[02:39:09.034 --> 02:39:11.596]  That's what's so crazy is so much of it is admitted.
[02:39:12.621 --> 02:39:26.104]  And now they're just shelling everyone on the idea of authoritarian control for security, but really the authoritarian control's coming in to take out their real enemy, any wealthy or middle class folks that aren't part of the system.
[02:39:27.224 --> 02:39:27.444]  Right.
[02:39:28.484 --> 02:39:32.505]  They're solidifying their control as if they need more control.
[02:39:36.513 --> 02:39:38.934]  Well, Fritz, I gotta say, you are on fire today.
[02:39:39.255 --> 02:39:41.336]  You'll be on the Nightly News tomorrow for 30 minutes.
[02:39:41.736 --> 02:39:43.857]  And then did we choose a date for you to come on next week yet?
[02:39:46.098 --> 02:39:47.459]  Not yet, but we can do it.
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:50.241]  Guys, let's look at the calendar and pick one right now.
[02:39:51.341 --> 02:39:52.362]  So I can tell the audience.
[02:39:52.522 --> 02:39:55.364]  I just want to tell the audience what day would be good.
[02:39:55.684 --> 02:39:58.245]  I mean, Fritz, just let us know a date that's good next week in the third hour.
[02:39:58.826 --> 02:40:00.767]  One o'clock central and you're on, okay?
[02:40:01.801 --> 02:40:05.103]  Okay, it looks like my schedule's free during the week.
[02:40:05.924 --> 02:40:06.484]  Alright, good.
[02:40:06.524 --> 02:40:07.865]  Well, we'll talk to you right now off-air.
[02:40:08.205 --> 02:40:09.166]  Fritz Springmeier, folks.
[02:40:09.186 --> 02:40:10.226]  Bloodlines Illuminati.
[02:40:10.506 --> 02:40:11.687]  Fritz Springmeier, the book.
[02:40:12.147 --> 02:40:14.249]  Available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:40:14.269 --> 02:40:15.149]  Thank you so much, Fritz.
[02:40:15.430 --> 02:40:18.451]  We'll talk to you tomorrow night on the Nightly News and next week.
[02:40:18.752 --> 02:40:19.412]  What a godsend.
[02:40:19.432 --> 02:40:20.813]  He's got good internet and good Skype.
[02:40:20.833 --> 02:40:23.414]  So we can have him on as a regular guest.
[02:40:23.775 --> 02:40:23.935]  Now...
[02:40:25.498 --> 02:40:28.479]  I haven't really plugged a lot in the last two hours, okay?
[02:40:28.519 --> 02:40:29.359]  Two hours, 40 minutes.
[02:40:29.379 --> 02:40:32.680]  I want to go right to your calls, Tom, Chris, and others that are patiently holding.
[02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:35.121]  John, Alex, Brian, we'll get to all of you.
[02:40:35.781 --> 02:40:42.843]  Briefly, we are running a 10% off special at InfoWarsTore.com when everything else is already discounted.
[02:40:43.543 --> 02:40:51.786]  We've got 30 plus percent discounts on Survival Shield, Nascent Iodine, and Fluoride Shield, the detoxifying chelator.
[02:40:52.708 --> 02:40:54.809]  We've already got that special going.
[02:40:54.869 --> 02:40:57.211]  We've got 25% off on Fluoride Shield by itself.
[02:40:57.791 --> 02:41:03.895]  We've got a bunch of other specials running right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:41:04.456 --> 02:41:06.337]  And I think Silver Bullet's sold out, isn't it?
[02:41:06.357 --> 02:41:07.458]  That's why it's not on the site now.
[02:41:07.958 --> 02:41:10.580]  So, when I tell you something's selling out, folks, I'm not making it up.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.862]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:41:15.043 --> 02:41:16.203]  10% off everything.
[02:41:16.324 --> 02:41:17.364]  Books, videos.
[02:41:17.825 --> 02:41:19.646]  InfoWars.com camo hats.
[02:41:21.451 --> 02:41:24.934]  Uh, nickel and, uh, brass Patriot belt buckles.
[02:41:25.515 --> 02:41:26.776]  A bunch of those have sold out now.
[02:41:26.796 --> 02:41:28.618]  We've got a few of the designs left.
[02:41:28.758 --> 02:41:29.419]  Limited edition.
[02:41:31.060 --> 02:41:32.562]  Made in America.
[02:41:32.842 --> 02:41:40.189]  InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase during this crazy time makes the whole operation possible.
[02:41:41.721 --> 02:41:44.301]  And again, I don't think we've reached the total crisis point yet.
[02:41:44.522 --> 02:41:47.182]  All of this is to maneuver us into that position.
[02:41:47.602 --> 02:42:03.885]  The Survival Mega Seed Vaults, best price, non-GMO, super high quality, at prices no one else can top, 10% off, with promo code 1-0 at checkout, applies a blanket 10% off your entire order.
[02:42:04.705 --> 02:42:07.866]  We already have the lowest price on almost everything, or very competitive.
[02:42:09.008 --> 02:42:14.752]  Now, we sign agreements and stuff that we can't even sell stuff for even lower because that drives down the whole market of some of the stuff we carry.
[02:42:15.072 --> 02:42:15.753]  The best stuff.
[02:42:15.993 --> 02:42:18.195]  Well, I can do 10% off the whole blanket at checkout.
[02:42:19.115 --> 02:42:22.197]  I guess there is, they told me Silver Bullet was sold out, but I do see it up there.
[02:42:23.318 --> 02:42:24.099]  That's confusing.
[02:42:24.159 --> 02:42:28.802]  The point is, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, 888-253-3139.
[02:42:28.882 --> 02:42:32.305]  And whatever you do, spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:42:38.194 --> 02:42:46.518]  Spread the word about your local AM and FM affiliates and support those local sponsors or become a sponsor and ask stations that are carrying us on the weekend to carry us during the week.
[02:42:46.939 --> 02:42:49.000]  Or if they're carrying us at night, tell them to carry us during the day.
[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:51.081]  That's what happens with almost every affiliate.
[02:42:51.581 --> 02:42:56.304]  They carry us on the weekend with a live Sunday show, then they pick us up weeknights, then they carry us live.
[02:42:57.164 --> 02:42:59.886]  And that's what happens because people are hungry for the truth.
[02:42:59.926 --> 02:43:04.168]  And look, I'm here trying to cover the sensational nature of reality.
[02:43:05.458 --> 02:43:16.381]  To get people out of their comfort zone, to get them out of their trance, so they see how serious things are, so we get past the normalcy bias, and people get upset and we can turn back the tide.
[02:43:16.742 --> 02:43:19.422]  Obama opening the borders without even an executive order.
[02:43:19.662 --> 02:43:20.923]  An executive order would be treason!
[02:43:21.718 --> 02:43:22.298]  Just doing it.
[02:43:23.459 --> 02:43:24.760]  Putting our military under U.N.
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:25.740]  control and NATO.
[02:43:26.501 --> 02:43:28.762]  Running all these scams, Fast and Furious.
[02:43:29.162 --> 02:43:30.503]  Shutting down our power plants.
[02:43:30.843 --> 02:43:31.623]  Common Core.
[02:43:32.164 --> 02:43:34.165]  Looting the Treasury with banker bailouts.
[02:43:34.225 --> 02:43:36.246]  I mean, it is just, it's insane!
[02:43:37.779 --> 02:43:46.060]  We have a chance to turn it around if we decide we can, if we decide to get involved and quit only caring about football or dancing with the stars.
[02:43:46.621 --> 02:43:55.302]  Anybody who watches cop shows where every episode a gun owner is going to mass murder people or a veteran is going to mass murder, I mean, none of that's really happening.
[02:43:56.302 --> 02:43:59.463]  Statistically, conservatives and libertarians have the lowest crime rate.
[02:43:59.483 --> 02:44:01.063]  Look it up in the Justice Department's own numbers.
[02:44:04.324 --> 02:44:06.404]  Constitutionalists, the lowest crime rate.
[02:44:09.909 --> 02:44:14.951]  I mean, you start researching patriots, we are like the most law-abiding good people.
[02:44:15.231 --> 02:44:16.131]  What does the government do?
[02:44:16.191 --> 02:44:17.751]  Oh, they're the babas, they're gonna rebel.
[02:44:18.012 --> 02:44:21.293]  Well, of course you try to take our guns or stick us in a FEMA camp, yeah!
[02:44:21.853 --> 02:44:24.033]  We're not gonna go loot stores and throw them all off cocktails.
[02:44:24.274 --> 02:44:25.194]  You know what's gonna happen!
[02:44:25.894 --> 02:44:30.559]  And the globalists want to execute the military and the police running that operation.
[02:44:30.879 --> 02:44:33.722]  And I keep telling people this isn't a game, okay?
[02:44:33.943 --> 02:44:34.643]  I'm gonna shut up now.
[02:44:34.884 --> 02:44:36.926]  Tom in New York, you've been holding since earlier.
[02:44:37.146 --> 02:44:37.847]  You made some points.
[02:44:37.907 --> 02:44:39.408]  Finish in one minute right now.
[02:44:39.468 --> 02:44:42.251]  I gotta get to Chris and John and Alex and Brian and others.
[02:44:42.291 --> 02:44:42.592]  Go ahead.
[02:44:43.723 --> 02:44:46.024]  You got it, you're getting your ass back, but that's exactly it.
[02:44:46.164 --> 02:44:52.305]  This all needs to stop so that everybody stops being played pawns in this, to corral everybody into what you're talking about.
[02:44:52.725 --> 02:44:53.766]  I'm begging the St.
[02:44:53.846 --> 02:45:02.388]  Louis County Coroner, Medical Examiner's Office, as well as the forensic techs out there, come forward with the evidence you have.
[02:45:02.808 --> 02:45:09.790]  You know whether there was an altercation that happened inside that vehicle, or whether or not Michael Brown was shot in a running forward position.
[02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:12.911]  They know exactly what went on that triggered this whole event.
[02:45:13.371 --> 02:45:17.614]  I'm begging them to come forward despite the fact that the feds have now taken over the autopsy.
[02:45:20.335 --> 02:45:21.636]  And explain why that's important.
[02:45:22.977 --> 02:45:30.381]  Why that's important is because this whole thing was triggered by what was believed to be the execution of an unarmed man by a member of law enforcement.
[02:45:31.662 --> 02:45:38.626]  Once that truth comes out as to what the reality was that set this off, the whole jig will be up.
[02:45:39.184 --> 02:45:43.907]  The feds organized chaos to play everybody as pawns against each other to bring in martial law.
[02:45:44.327 --> 02:45:49.270]  As you continually hammer on every day, again, that operation can be destroyed.
[02:45:49.770 --> 02:45:50.851]  Pushed by the wayside.
[02:45:50.871 --> 02:45:56.854]  It will not stop them completely, but at least we can move past this one point of chaos where this thing explodes.
[02:45:57.155 --> 02:45:57.875]  That's a great point.
[02:45:57.955 --> 02:45:59.996]  How to get past the point of chaos.
[02:46:00.056 --> 02:46:00.717]  Thank you so much.
[02:46:02.025 --> 02:46:03.346]  Because I just want to have a country.
[02:46:03.406 --> 02:46:04.366]  I want to have stability.
[02:46:04.446 --> 02:46:05.767]  I don't want to have a civil war.
[02:46:06.447 --> 02:46:08.508]  Got a bunch of idiot thugs trying to get one going.
[02:46:09.269 --> 02:46:11.730]  Got the police shooting reporters for no reason.
[02:46:11.750 --> 02:46:13.691]  It's just a disaster.
[02:46:15.032 --> 02:46:16.153]  Why aren't they releasing it?
[02:46:16.213 --> 02:46:18.794]  Because a lot of witnesses are confirming what the police said now.
[02:46:19.094 --> 02:46:19.854]  Black witnesses.
[02:46:21.355 --> 02:46:23.136]  So, why aren't they releasing it?
[02:46:26.418 --> 02:46:27.599]  The whole thing's very suspicious.
[02:46:28.502 --> 02:46:31.263]  And again, people are like, well, it's one dead guy out of all the other stuff happening.
[02:46:31.303 --> 02:46:32.244]  Why is it such a big deal?
[02:46:32.444 --> 02:46:34.165]  Because the media is making it a big deal.
[02:46:34.585 --> 02:46:37.827]  Chris in Vegas, former police officer, your take on the situation.
[02:46:37.867 --> 02:46:38.407]  Thanks for holding.
[02:46:41.829 --> 02:46:42.549]  Chris, you still there?
[02:46:43.950 --> 02:46:45.010]  Come back to him and see if he's there.
[02:46:45.450 --> 02:46:48.312]  Alex in Minnesota, former Army, what is your take on this?
[02:46:49.781 --> 02:46:58.385]  Hey Alex, I just want to talk a little bit about how, if you just sit back and look at the situation, it just reminds me of the first Civil War, how Missouri is involved again.
[02:46:58.405 --> 02:47:04.147]  And I'm a student of history, I just find it ironic that the same players are involved again.
[02:47:04.167 --> 02:47:07.108]  And I think we should all just sit back and look at what's going on.
[02:47:07.548 --> 02:47:12.070]  And then my second point is, I think we have a problem with bully culture, and it's just everywhere now.
[02:47:13.271 --> 02:47:16.332]  You know, I was thinking that the other day in the car, listening to talk radio.
[02:47:17.549 --> 02:47:44.758]  about the thug uh... knockout game culture about redneck groups acting like uh... thugs uh... the police doing that you either have a bully culture or you don't and you're right it's bully culture it's men that think it's tough to get in groups and then mess with people that aren't doing anything and if you look at the thugs running around bullying our reporters and they were doing that the last three days now
[02:47:46.124 --> 02:47:47.105]  They mirror the police.
[02:47:47.165 --> 02:47:50.187]  It's like the thugs and the cops are acting like the same thing.
[02:47:53.169 --> 02:47:54.270]  Is that what you're getting at, Alex?
[02:47:55.103 --> 02:47:55.783]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:47:55.823 --> 02:48:00.646]  What I see is whether it was... We've seen Mike Brown in the video was being a bully.
[02:48:01.807 --> 02:48:10.673]  Whether the police, they were being bullies with him, but definitely the police were being bullies with the protesters, and like you said, the protesters being bullies against you guys.
[02:48:11.093 --> 02:48:12.354]  It's just a pervasive thing.
[02:48:12.514 --> 02:48:19.838]  I think what's wrong with our country is our value on human dignity, and we don't value life anymore.
[02:48:21.439 --> 02:48:21.920]  That's right.
[02:48:21.940 --> 02:48:23.541]  Started out with 53 million babies.
[02:48:24.366 --> 02:48:26.126]  Getting killed in the last 40 years.
[02:48:26.506 --> 02:48:28.287]  People say bad stuff can never come here.
[02:48:28.407 --> 02:48:29.107]  It has come here.
[02:48:30.287 --> 02:48:31.748]  People say, oh, it can never happen here.
[02:48:32.228 --> 02:48:33.968]  It did happen here, and now it's getting worse.
[02:48:34.028 --> 02:48:34.948]  Great points, Alex.
[02:48:35.328 --> 02:48:35.928]  Great call.
[02:48:37.169 --> 02:48:38.269]  Is Chris back from Vegas?
[02:48:38.309 --> 02:48:39.049]  Let's check that.
[02:48:39.809 --> 02:48:42.570]  Okay, Chris, former police, what's your view on this?
[02:48:43.770 --> 02:48:48.631]  Well, I'm calling from Fremont Region Zone 9 on a truth GI on InfoWars.
[02:48:48.691 --> 02:48:49.831]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:48:50.352 --> 02:48:51.232]  Well, thanks for calling, Chris.
[02:48:51.252 --> 02:48:52.052]  What do you think's going on?
[02:48:52.776 --> 02:48:53.897]  Well, you're exactly right.
[02:48:53.917 --> 02:49:00.801]  This is a mass psyops operation using the hog alley and dialectic problem reaction solution.
[02:49:01.602 --> 02:49:22.496]  And they're trying to divide and conquer creating a false paradigm of race based division using the black groups versus the white groups, the white police of Ferguson in the state against the new Black Panthers brought in by the Department of Justice as their local
[02:49:23.439 --> 02:49:23.659]  I don't
[02:49:41.821 --> 02:49:53.927]  A map to Ferguson's house and several different media units from the lamestream media have published critical details and done production showing exactly where Darren Wilson lives.
[02:49:54.548 --> 02:49:59.070]  It's my contention that what they will do is a Chris Dorner sort of thing.
[02:49:59.110 --> 02:50:04.853]  There will be some sort of illusion of a takeout of Darren Wilson to diffuse the issue.
[02:50:04.873 --> 02:50:08.995]  He'll be put into the Witness Protection Program and rotated to some other
[02:50:09.582 --> 02:50:15.045]  You are correct that CNN and others are showing where the police officer lives at and even how to get there.
[02:50:15.125 --> 02:50:17.226]  That is obviously to put it in someone's mind to go there.
[02:50:17.246 --> 02:50:20.628]  It'd be one thing if they said his name, but showing where he lives?
[02:50:20.708 --> 02:50:21.588]  I mean, that is wild.
[02:50:38.547 --> 02:50:46.121]  Well, this plays into their, uh, 10 United States Code 23 at 58, the Storm Thurman National Defense Act of 1961 and its evil twin sister.
[02:50:51.155 --> 02:50:57.540]  Which is the Freedom From War United States Program for General and Complete Disarmament.
[02:51:09.108 --> 02:51:11.129]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[02:51:11.490 --> 02:51:24.497]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[02:51:25.558 --> 02:51:27.240]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:29.642]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[02:51:29.682 --> 02:51:35.767]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:51:36.107 --> 02:51:44.114]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[02:51:44.674 --> 02:51:50.157]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[02:51:50.377 --> 02:51:57.241]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:51:57.361 --> 02:51:57.661]  That's 877-532-5388.

[02:54:34.249 --> 02:54:40.371]  Coming up in about five minutes when we go into Overdrive, Paul is going to break the news with the documentation in T-minus five minutes.
[02:54:41.591 --> 02:54:42.772]  I want it red-linked.
[02:54:44.670 --> 02:54:45.171]  The U.S.
[02:54:45.331 --> 02:54:49.295]  Army publicly prepares to shoot unarmed citizens in New Manual.
[02:54:50.176 --> 02:54:52.399]  I don't know what his headline is going to be, but it's just bombshell.
[02:54:52.439 --> 02:54:53.540]  I've got the document right here.
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:55.182]  In fact, I've got part of it.
[02:54:55.202 --> 02:54:55.882]  Will you get Nemo?
[02:54:55.922 --> 02:54:57.784]  He was in there writing a story about it, too, to print me the whole thing.
[02:54:57.825 --> 02:54:58.445]  Or somebody, too.
[02:54:58.525 --> 02:54:58.866]  Thank you.
[02:54:59.486 --> 02:55:01.388]  Just when you see documents like that, just print me the whole thing.
[02:55:01.408 --> 02:55:01.609]  Thanks.
[02:55:03.223 --> 02:55:04.524]  I know it's over 100 pages long.
[02:55:05.364 --> 02:55:07.985]  It's got the diagrams of where to shoot the unarmed people.
[02:55:08.065 --> 02:55:09.406]  It's just unbelievable treason.
[02:55:09.986 --> 02:55:12.567]  And they're openly trying to get the military to go along with this.
[02:55:13.148 --> 02:55:15.089]  The destabilization will be real, though.
[02:55:15.629 --> 02:55:17.430]  Just like IS killing people is real.
[02:55:17.950 --> 02:55:21.212]  It's just the globalists funded them, protected them, turned them loose.
[02:55:22.392 --> 02:55:23.353]  The Ferguson family
[02:55:24.369 --> 02:55:41.457]  has now come out and said that their son was murdered and they've got this medical examiner come in from town uh... celebrity medical examiner saying it was an execution obviously to to stir all this up a lot more uh... this is going from bad to worse by the minute
[02:55:42.694 --> 02:55:46.499]  And don't worry, the globalists will have other tricks up their sleeves to destabilize.
[02:55:46.879 --> 02:55:47.961]  Chris, other points.
[02:55:47.981 --> 02:55:49.182]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:55:49.683 --> 02:55:54.609]  And you were getting to 7277 and the plan for complete and total disarmament in the U.S.
[02:55:54.649 --> 02:55:56.631]  by UNESCO and the U.N.
[02:55:56.811 --> 02:56:01.117]  under Treaty 1961 and the plan to use civil unrest to do it.
[02:56:02.159 --> 02:56:02.900]  Well, absolutely.
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:17.234]  In fact, Fritz was speaking of the same thing, the bloodlines of the Illuminati, that 10 United States Code 2358, the strong Thurman National Defense Act of 1961, was actually Prescott Bush's template.
[02:56:17.715 --> 02:56:24.422]  And of course, its progeny is the National Defense Authorization Act, or like we in the truth community call it, the Kill a Patriot Act.
[02:56:25.555 --> 02:56:31.350]  And I think what you're seeing here is what we talked about the last time I was on, the asymmetrical form of war.
[02:56:31.431 --> 02:56:34.398]  This is a form of war against the American people.
[02:56:35.049 --> 02:56:42.813]  It is a slow-boiling-frog style of it, where they inculcate it by incrementalism, and this is exactly what we're seeing.
[02:56:43.273 --> 02:57:01.421]  And if they can stir up a confrontation, even if they have to put provocateurs in the audience like they did last night with a protesting crowd, to fire shots on the police, to provide the stimulus to provoke the police reaction they seek to elicit, then
[02:57:02.114 --> 02:57:10.400]  Doesn't matter whether it's the Podo sisters do it or the provocateurs do it, they'll still have the same result they're looking for to create an effectual war on the streets of St.
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:10.760]  Louis.
[02:57:13.322 --> 02:57:14.122]  We're gonna find out.
[02:57:14.162 --> 02:57:18.465]  The National Guard is showing up there with heavy armored vehicles and we're gonna have reporters there.
[02:57:19.546 --> 02:57:22.268]  All I know is the National Guard better not target my reporters.
[02:57:24.089 --> 02:57:27.831]  I wonder how they got the police to target innocent reporters on the news.
[02:57:28.572 --> 02:57:30.413]  I mean, is that meant to demonize the police?
[02:57:30.493 --> 02:57:31.674]  Why would they follow those orders?
[02:57:33.251 --> 02:58:00.218]  Because your truth-based news reporting has put the sunshine of light on these global terrorists in the White House, the Department of Justice Eric Holder, the shyster for the pretender POTUS Barack Hussein Obama and his criminal cabal, that is perpetrating this hideous form of revolutionary takeover of this country under the guise of protecting the public from all these terrorists.
[02:58:01.049 --> 02:58:02.909]  Well, the military that I talked to gets it.
[02:58:02.970 --> 02:58:04.470]  A lot of the police are starting to get it.
[02:58:05.570 --> 02:58:11.432]  I just can't see from a catbird's seat, because I'm not in a catbird's seat, really how the game's going.
[02:58:11.472 --> 02:58:17.333]  But if we end up losing to this, I don't know what to say, because we know their game plan.
[02:58:17.773 --> 02:58:20.654]  It's just, can people realize that we know what we're talking about?
[02:58:21.074 --> 02:58:26.496]  Or will we allow the Globalists to win with Cloward and Piven, with this destabilization program?
[02:58:26.516 --> 02:58:26.936]  What do you think?
[02:58:28.044 --> 02:58:37.994]  I think we have one prayer, Alex, and that's if a large element of the military is awake enough to know what's going on, that they're being used as pawns in this global game.
[02:58:38.074 --> 02:58:41.517]  I agree, but what do they do when 10,000 people are trying to shoot them or burn them?
[02:58:42.058 --> 02:58:45.521]  It's just the fight happens regardless, because even if it's staged, it's still real!
[02:58:45.781 --> 02:58:47.883]  We'll be back in Overdrive, InfoWars.com, 4 Slash Show.
[02:58:49.645 --> 02:58:52.409]  Free iPhone app at Infowars.com.
[02:58:52.449 --> 02:58:54.172]  Bottom of the page.
[02:58:54.212 --> 02:58:55.073]  On the home page.
[02:58:55.234 --> 02:58:56.435]  Tom and John, I'm going to you.
[02:58:56.756 --> 02:58:58.458]  And Paul Watson with Bombshell News.
[02:58:59.349 --> 02:59:05.455]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:59:05.475 --> 02:59:08.818]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:59:08.918 --> 02:59:10.540]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[02:59:10.580 --> 02:59:16.846]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spears.
[02:59:16.946 --> 02:59:22.832]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:59:22.972 --> 02:59:26.735]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:59:26.915 --> 02:59:29.818]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:59:29.838 --> 02:59:38.024]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:59:38.284 --> 02:59:40.326]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:59:40.386 --> 02:59:41.447]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:59:41.787 --> 02:59:50.549]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[03:00:00.112 --> 03:00:01.272]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:01.652 --> 03:00:03.073]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.713 --> 03:00:06.914]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:15.171 --> 03:00:19.314]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:19.994 --> 03:00:20.795]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.576 --> 03:00:22.476]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:23.117 --> 03:00:26.799]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:27.340 --> 03:00:31.383]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:52.964 --> 03:00:56.105]  Alright folks, barely made it back in here because I was out there during the break.
[03:00:56.505 --> 03:00:57.326]  Too much has happened.
[03:00:57.346 --> 03:01:00.787]  We're not going to get to the Joe Rogan interview today, even though it's on these topics.
[03:01:00.827 --> 03:01:02.448]  We'll maybe air it tomorrow.
[03:01:02.848 --> 03:01:03.608]  We'll see about that.
[03:01:04.489 --> 03:01:06.549]  But right now, we are taking your phone calls.
[03:01:06.649 --> 03:01:14.292]  John in Texas, then Tom in Missouri, then Paul Watson joins us with again news so big and so powerful, I don't even feel worthy.
[03:01:15.393 --> 03:01:18.634]  And I don't mean like I don't feel like a good enough person to put the info out.
[03:01:19.094 --> 03:01:20.695]  It's such a big responsibility.
[03:01:22.743 --> 03:01:23.223]  Hi Alex.
[03:01:23.584 --> 03:01:24.484]  I grew up in the 1960's Alex.
[03:01:24.504 --> 03:01:27.226]  I was in high school when all these guys broke out in the 60's.
[03:01:45.106 --> 03:01:46.787]  That's how they passed the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[03:02:07.634 --> 03:02:20.086]  Back then, if we're working to start the riot, these communist revolutionaries funded by the tax exempt foundations, they're the same people that probably in Ferguson, they're probably working in other cities right now trying to get things riled up as it is, as we speak now.
[03:02:21.052 --> 03:02:25.694]  That's right, we need to show how black riots were used in the 60s to restrict the Second Amendment.
[03:02:26.034 --> 03:02:28.355]  And you better believe that's the game plan now.
[03:02:28.855 --> 03:02:35.498]  And you won't hear any conservative media talking about the government and the Ford Foundation and the Justice Department.
[03:02:35.879 --> 03:02:44.763]  Only Drudge, DARE, linked to our article proving DOJ and Communists are working with New Black Panthers to hijack Ferguson protests.
[03:02:45.523 --> 03:02:49.004]  Only Drudge will tell people that, other than Infowars.com.
[03:02:51.124 --> 03:02:52.265]  This is totally scripted.
[03:02:52.285 --> 03:02:53.245]  It makes me want to throw up.
[03:02:55.707 --> 03:03:02.091]  Yeah, so if riots break out in other cities, Alex, we know who's responsible for it, who's behind it, and what's going to come out of this.
[03:03:02.131 --> 03:03:03.191]  More gun control?
[03:03:03.231 --> 03:03:03.992]  More restrictions?
[03:03:06.953 --> 03:03:07.494]  Absolutely.
[03:03:07.534 --> 03:03:08.614]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:08.694 --> 03:03:09.315]  God bless you.
[03:03:09.815 --> 03:03:11.416]  By the way, Paul has his headline out.
[03:03:11.516 --> 03:03:12.917]  The headline's not hardcore enough.
[03:03:13.337 --> 03:03:14.258]  He's listening right now.
[03:03:15.717 --> 03:03:20.765]  Document army preparing to use lethal force against unarmed Americans during full-scale riots in the U.S.
[03:03:22.048 --> 03:03:26.835]  That is super hardcore, but I can't think of something as super hardcore as the document itself.
[03:03:29.099 --> 03:03:32.361]  Civil disturbances, April 2014, released two days ago.
[03:03:32.821 --> 03:03:34.722]  Our listeners just sent it to us today.
[03:03:35.563 --> 03:03:38.725]  Approved for public release, distribution is unlimited.
[03:03:39.225 --> 03:03:40.646]  Headquarters, Department of the Army.
[03:03:41.346 --> 03:03:49.251]  And it's how to process your social security numbers, where to shoot Americans who are unarmed, how to terrorize the public by killing the citizens.
[03:03:50.111 --> 03:03:52.593]  And then you wonder why the police following this manual.
[03:03:53.773 --> 03:03:56.155]  That's what you gotta do courses on this to get the armored vehicles.
[03:03:57.165 --> 03:04:00.328]  Then you wonder why they fired at unarmed reporters.
[03:04:00.948 --> 03:04:02.470]  It's to terrorize the public.
[03:04:03.210 --> 03:04:04.892]  Which, actually, they're lying to them.
[03:04:04.932 --> 03:04:06.373]  It only makes the public get more mad.
[03:04:06.733 --> 03:04:08.275]  This is so diabolical.
[03:04:10.396 --> 03:04:14.360]  We're going to get to Toma, Missouri, as well, during the interview with Paul Watson.
[03:04:14.380 --> 03:04:18.343]  I'm going to try to focus when we go to break, come back and get into all this.
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:21.943]  We need to red link this article on Infowars.com.
[03:04:22.363 --> 03:04:23.364]  It just went live.
[03:04:23.945 --> 03:04:27.508]  Everybody on Facebook needs to put this out to everyone you know.
[03:04:27.829 --> 03:04:29.851]  If you have a website, copy it to your website.
[03:04:33.277 --> 03:04:37.899]  Document Army preparing to use lethal force against unarmed civilians.
[03:04:37.939 --> 03:04:38.760]  That's a quote.
[03:04:39.260 --> 03:04:40.380]  During full-scale riots.
[03:04:40.420 --> 03:04:41.061]  That's a quote.
[03:04:41.701 --> 03:04:44.902]  Training manual outlines sniper response during crowd control operations.
[03:04:45.683 --> 03:04:47.744]  Snipers to be used on peaceful demonstrators.
[03:04:48.384 --> 03:04:50.385]  And then Kurt Nemo didn't even know Paul was working on this.
[03:04:50.425 --> 03:04:52.806]  He simultaneously put his own article out.
[03:04:52.926 --> 03:04:53.146]  U.S.
[03:04:53.186 --> 03:04:56.588]  Army releases action plan for civil unrest during Ferguson riot.
[03:04:57.829 --> 03:05:00.292]  Additional effort to nullify posse commentatus.
[03:05:00.973 --> 03:05:02.535]  This is all getting crazy.
[03:05:02.896 --> 03:05:05.980]  Meanwhile, the globalists are literally throwing gas on the fire.
[03:05:11.118 --> 03:05:13.160]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[03:05:13.380 --> 03:05:16.523]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[03:05:16.723 --> 03:05:19.205]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[03:05:19.465 --> 03:05:23.128]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[03:05:23.408 --> 03:05:26.891]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.

[03:05:43.820 --> 03:05:46.961]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?

[03:08:00.925 --> 03:08:02.707]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:22.864 --> 03:08:25.526]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London.
[03:08:26.327 --> 03:08:44.541]  I am holding in my hand, if you are a TV viewer, Civil Disturbances, April 2014, ATP 3-3933, Headquarters, Department of the Army, released at Army.mil two days ago.
[03:08:46.002 --> 03:08:51.506]  Approved for public release last Friday, released on Saturday.
[03:08:52.549 --> 03:09:03.136]  It details the use of lethal force with snipers of unarmed Americans during full-scale riots in the United States.
[03:09:03.856 --> 03:09:08.379]  Now, I've known for a long time their training in what they call zombie wave attack.
[03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:19.006]  The public would get video of the Army and Marines training to mow down mainly rural people in John Deere caps, cowboy cats, overalls, you name it.
[03:09:19.026 --> 03:09:20.007]  We've been covering this for years.
[03:09:20.047 --> 03:09:20.868]  We even got video of it.
[03:09:21.875 --> 03:09:24.118]  Mowing down peaceful protesters in drills.
[03:09:25.500 --> 03:09:27.603]  I made films like Police Day 2000 on the subject.
[03:09:28.184 --> 03:09:31.308]  So the last four or five years they call it zombie attack training.
[03:09:31.728 --> 03:09:34.292]  You can look up army trains to take on zombies.
[03:09:35.493 --> 03:09:36.995]  Marines train to take on zombies.
[03:09:37.496 --> 03:09:38.437]  And so they just put some...
[03:09:39.264 --> 03:09:52.060]  You know, green paint on them or whatever and have them act like zombies and claim it's all a joke, when really they're desensitizing and dehumanizing us to the military and practicing to mow down masses of people.
[03:09:53.882 --> 03:09:57.948]  And the larger zombie meme has been used to sell this idea.
[03:09:59.315 --> 03:10:22.495]  Then, on July 17th, we did a special 29-minute report and an article detailing how the military was going to prime the pump with staged race war between blacks and whites for the civil unrest as a pretext to roll martial law out with a cover story, while the real internal training
[03:10:24.090 --> 03:10:27.152]  that's going on is to go after American gun owners.
[03:10:27.672 --> 03:10:32.315]  Just like they claim it's for people in the 8th or 9th Ward who are looting.
[03:10:32.996 --> 03:10:36.638]  In Katrina, really it's the high and dry areas, gun confiscations.
[03:10:38.199 --> 03:10:39.560]  So we understand this program.
[03:10:41.221 --> 03:10:44.242]  And we're showing the articles on screen for TV viewers.
[03:10:44.303 --> 03:10:47.004]  Radio listeners, look them up for yourself.
[03:10:48.865 --> 03:10:49.426]  Back in
[03:10:51.092 --> 03:10:53.526]  July, we detailed the same Army manual.
[03:10:53.909 --> 03:10:54.934]  Now it's been updated.
[03:10:56.735 --> 03:11:00.718]  The story is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:11:01.158 --> 03:11:02.579]  We need you to get out to everybody you know.
[03:11:02.999 --> 03:11:11.005]  Paul Watson, I want to give you the floor to calmly walk through all of this in the segment we have right now.
[03:11:11.645 --> 03:11:19.570]  Because, again, a new listener, a new viewer just thinks, hey, you've got people about to riot, you've got looting going on, they've got to maintain order.
[03:11:19.950 --> 03:11:21.772]  The armored vehicles have already been delivered.
[03:11:22.032 --> 03:11:23.873]  The Army practiced taking over all of St.
[03:11:23.893 --> 03:11:26.215]  Louis two years ago with regular Army.
[03:11:26.915 --> 03:11:30.736]  They began to announce their National Stabilization Force, NORTHCOM.
[03:11:32.096 --> 03:11:46.199]  This is scripted to get the military, the police, and the public to go along with it, to set the precedent, fighting with a bunch of Al Sharpton, Justice Department-run provocateurs.
[03:11:46.559 --> 03:11:47.959]  It's a simulated battle.
[03:11:47.979 --> 03:11:53.220]  Really real thugs getting shot, useful idiots, with the police.
[03:11:54.298 --> 03:11:56.681]  To set the precedent for wider martial law.
[03:11:57.161 --> 03:11:59.063]  Paul Watson, A, do you concur with that analysis?
[03:11:59.083 --> 03:12:00.445]  B, let's get into your news article.
[03:12:02.290 --> 03:12:23.940]  I do, Alex, and that's what I've been saying for years, and that's what I said on Thursday, I believe it was, when I put out a video, saying that Ferguson was a trial balloon for this wider crackdown that they've been planning, which is why the militarisation, the tactics that they used, are designed to inflame the tensions, because they've been preparing for and fostering these riots for years.
[03:12:24.880 --> 03:12:26.001]  And this is a new document
[03:12:26.884 --> 03:12:37.748]  The US Army, called Civil Disturbances, it was released, it was written in April 2014, released recently, approved for public release, distribution is unlimited.
[03:12:37.808 --> 03:12:44.791]  So whereas, you know, before we had to wait at least a couple of years until we saw this kind of stuff, now we've got it within four months.
[03:12:45.871 --> 03:13:01.605]  It's basically a training manual for how the US Army will deal with domestic disturbances and crowd control and civil unrest within the United States, again within CONUS, the Continental United States.
[03:13:02.332 --> 03:13:15.432]  The most shocking aspect of it, as you've mentioned, is a section entitled Lethal Response, which outlines how they would deal with, quote, crowd control of, quote, unarmed civilians.
[03:13:16.468 --> 03:13:25.456]  And the primary method of dealing with that, according to the US Army's own document, ensure that target leaders or troublemakers are targeted.
[03:13:26.076 --> 03:13:28.859]  Exploit the psychological effect of an attack.
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:35.244]  This attack is a quote, sniper response directed against unarmed civilians.
[03:13:36.265 --> 03:13:39.928]  Then under a separate heading entitled small arms direct fire,
[03:13:41.109 --> 03:13:47.353]  They say, escalate gradually starting with a small caliber single round and work up to a large caliber automatic.
[03:13:47.713 --> 03:13:50.455]  So they're talking about shooting unarmed civilians.
[03:13:50.855 --> 03:13:54.757]  It's important to stress that they have a, you know, this is a 132 page document.
[03:13:55.077 --> 03:13:58.139]  They've got a whole graduated response build up to this.
[03:13:58.519 --> 03:14:00.821]  They're not gonna just show up and start shooting people.
[03:14:01.201 --> 03:14:06.884]  But this is the ultimate, if the stuff hits the fan, this is what they're being directed to do.
[03:14:07.545 --> 03:14:09.746]  Sniper response against unarmed civilians.
[03:14:10.922 --> 03:14:16.082]  Then another chart called Escalation of Trauma chart, figure three to four.
[03:14:17.349 --> 03:14:22.110]  This outlines how they would deal with people using riot batons.
[03:14:22.610 --> 03:14:27.351]  They've got three levels of trauma, grey, white and patterned grey.
[03:14:27.391 --> 03:14:31.712]  The final one is, quote, deadly force, final target areas.
[03:14:32.532 --> 03:14:44.654]  So this is where they would whack people with a riot baton in order to cause the necessary injuries to incapacitate the target and cause, quote, serious bodily injury, shock or death.
[03:14:45.643 --> 03:14:47.765]  Again, it's a graduated response.
[03:14:47.825 --> 03:14:53.610]  They're not going to start doing this immediately, but this is the be-all and end-all for dealing with unruly crowds.
[03:14:54.311 --> 03:14:58.935]  And they go through the different areas of the body which could cause death if somebody's whacked on the head with a
[03:14:59.657 --> 03:15:05.580]  A riot baton, you know, back of the neck, spine, head and solar plexus.
[03:15:06.540 --> 03:15:14.003]  So they've got actual charts directing US troops on how to take out Americans within the continental United States.
[03:15:14.484 --> 03:15:20.226]  And as you mentioned before, it's in line with previous military documents which say the same thing.
[03:15:20.286 --> 03:15:26.769]  They talk about using lethal force to deal with unruly crowds within the United States.
[03:15:26.889 --> 03:15:35.777]  And I want to explain, they have engineered the deindustrialization, the power prices increasing, the food prices increasing, the collapse, just like they engineered the Arab Spring.
[03:15:36.278 --> 03:15:38.200]  We told people that a year before it happened.
[03:15:38.620 --> 03:15:42.384]  Google released the info that they organized it in Watford, England.
[03:15:43.104 --> 03:15:50.752]  And so, they are using their computer systems to war game this, and all of humanity is under attack.
[03:15:51.835 --> 03:16:04.345]  So, they are orchestrating the Foundation-run New Black Panthers and the Al Sharpton FBI informants and others to go stir stuff up, then cause the clash, so they can sell this idea.
[03:16:04.445 --> 03:16:13.673]  But remember, behind the scenes, 24-7, the main training is to take on gun owners.
[03:16:15.086 --> 03:16:27.094]  So once they're done crushing the inner city people and using the welfare riots that are coming as the pretext, they will then go after everybody else, including the police and their pensions.
[03:16:27.494 --> 03:16:29.596]  This is the end of freedom in America.
[03:16:30.156 --> 03:16:32.177]  None of this should be going along with this.
[03:16:32.197 --> 03:16:44.546]  This is the coming out of the NSA, the coming out of the cell phone kill switches, the coming out of the surveillance, the coming out of the MRAPs and the sound cannons, right as they all get delivered and right as
[03:16:45.506 --> 03:16:45.907]  The St.
[03:16:45.947 --> 03:16:50.370]  Louis police and others were told get ready for martial law in the last few months, Paul.
[03:16:50.611 --> 03:16:55.715]  We've seen a flurry of activity getting ready for this and then right on time this starts.
[03:16:56.776 --> 03:17:05.223]  And then now the family is out here with this quote celebrity medical examiner stirring it up saying he was executed and I've looked at it there's no evidence of that.
[03:17:07.216 --> 03:17:09.038]  This, this, this is bad news.
[03:17:09.078 --> 03:17:11.900]  And then a lot of dumbed down people go, why are you for the cops?
[03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:13.482]  Don't you want to have them burn everything down?
[03:17:14.103 --> 03:17:15.644]  This will destroy everybody.
[03:17:15.664 --> 03:17:16.925]  This is so stupid.
[03:17:17.306 --> 03:17:21.570]  But I tell you, Americans have killed 53 million babies and said they weren't humans.
[03:17:21.610 --> 03:17:23.231]  So maybe we just deserve to live under this.
[03:17:23.271 --> 03:17:25.713]  I mean, it's just, the public is so stupid.
[03:17:26.434 --> 03:17:29.117]  And the police are dumb enough to shoot at reporters for no reason.
[03:17:29.517 --> 03:17:32.019]  Maybe, maybe this is a country that's just done, Paul.
[03:17:32.740 --> 03:17:37.765]  I mean, I know the riots in your country, they allowed them to go on and provocateur a bunch of it and got caught.
[03:17:38.405 --> 03:17:39.606]  To expand the police state.
[03:17:40.187 --> 03:17:40.888]  This is sick!
[03:17:41.568 --> 03:17:42.529]  Paul, Paul Watson.
[03:17:43.850 --> 03:17:46.113]  Well, the key point I emphasized was the fact that
[03:17:46.997 --> 03:17:55.488]  When the police were actually needed to deal with the looting, both on the first night and on the Friday night, they were completely AWOL.
[03:17:56.029 --> 03:18:03.438]  But they were out in force when it came to tear-gassing Al Jazeera journalists and firing rubber bullets at peaceful protesters.
[03:18:03.899 --> 03:18:10.941]  Because remember, after the first night of looting, it was largely peaceful up until Friday night.
[03:18:10.981 --> 03:18:16.523]  Remember, I think it was on Thursday night, they had some of the police come out and walk with the demonstrators.
[03:18:16.883 --> 03:18:27.726]  So then everybody's thinking, oh, this is de-escalating because they've actually followed some semblance of common sense and withdrew the militarized goon squads pointing snipers at people.
[03:18:28.146 --> 03:18:30.267]  And this looks like it could be calming down.
[03:18:30.727 --> 03:18:33.848]  And immediately the next night, they're back out in force
[03:18:33.848 --> 03:18:34.172]  Once again.
[03:18:34.881 --> 03:18:45.165]  And again it goes back to that militarized police state tactic only inflames tensions, it only encourages more violence from the crowd and from the other elements that have poured in.
[03:18:45.825 --> 03:18:57.529]  Like the new Black Panthers, which of course the original Black Panthers have completely distanced themselves from this organization because it's proven to be militant, radicalized and in some cases violent.
[03:18:58.289 --> 03:19:03.611]  And this guy Shabazz, this new Black Panther leader was pictured working with
[03:19:04.251 --> 03:19:20.407]  The local police down there a couple of days ago, which is quite odd because at the very same time the FBI put out a warning saying that the new Black Panthers were, quote, advocating violence against the police and yet here's the leader of them coordinating with the police.
[03:19:20.427 --> 03:19:22.869]  You've got others, right, in sending your messages on.
[03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:34.880]  Facebook, then of course you've got a history of new Black Panthers being outed as federal informants like Richard Aoki who was outed as an FBI informant in 2012.
[03:19:36.994 --> 03:19:42.255]  You've got communists down there who look like they're part of the violence throwing the Molotov cocktails.
[03:19:42.675 --> 03:19:55.638]  So as soon as those elements came in on Friday night, whereas before it was largely peaceful, then we saw the violence which justified in the eyes of the authorities and the media the subsequent crackdown.
[03:19:56.118 --> 03:19:58.039]  So it's a symbiotic relationship.
[03:19:58.519 --> 03:20:11.168]  The militarized police state, the DHS, which of course is part of that with the contracts for the armored vehicles, they only benefit from more violence and they sure got it as soon as these rogue elements arrived on Friday night.
[03:20:14.570 --> 03:20:17.993]  Well, Paul, you have broken this down with absolute precision.
[03:20:20.600 --> 03:20:27.465]  I'm gonna be back on the nightly news tonight trying to condense this down to three or four minutes so people have a short video they can send friends and family.
[03:20:27.525 --> 03:20:34.470]  But if this video we put out from this live show is an hour long, everyone should forward it to friends and family.
[03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:36.952]  This is a premeditated takeover.
[03:20:37.472 --> 03:20:41.955]  It's going to be made to look like it's just responding to current events.
[03:20:42.055 --> 03:20:42.495]  It's not.
[03:20:45.177 --> 03:20:47.279]  We have got to warn everybody now.
[03:20:49.215 --> 03:20:51.396]  Before it's too late and try to turn this around.
[03:20:51.676 --> 03:20:53.016]  You're a smart guy, Watson.
[03:20:54.116 --> 03:20:55.657]  I respect your view on things.
[03:20:56.797 --> 03:21:01.358]  I'm going to be thinking on the show ends here in a few minutes about what I can do to try to turn this around.
[03:21:02.338 --> 03:21:05.799]  Even if we can't turn it around, it's our moral responsibility too.
[03:21:05.819 --> 03:21:08.560]  Do you have any idea in your gut
[03:21:11.650 --> 03:21:15.213]  On ways to diffuse this or stop it.
[03:21:15.833 --> 03:21:20.397]  Obviously reach out to the military and the police, but they're going to be getting attacked by real people.
[03:21:21.057 --> 03:21:22.738]  So how do you expect them not to respond?
[03:21:23.479 --> 03:21:31.125]  And then you got people in the police taking orders to escalate things, attacking reporters, arresting reporters in McDonald's, attacking our people.
[03:21:32.642 --> 03:21:38.756]  You can see how the training itself is designed to escalate things.
[03:21:39.798 --> 03:21:42.384]  So do you have any views on how we can turn this around?
[03:21:44.798 --> 03:22:04.331]  I would encourage people to get behind a huge campaign, which is embryonic in some cases, but we've certainly seen it, to completely defund and eventually abolish the Department of Homeland Security because that's where these local police departments are getting the grants to buy the armoured vehicles, to buy the military-style weapons
[03:22:05.111 --> 03:22:07.672]  That are the tools of this militarized police state.
[03:22:08.072 --> 03:22:15.254]  So it's all emanating from the DHS, which of course was put in place to fight terrorists back after 9-11.
[03:22:15.674 --> 03:22:26.117]  Now it's harassing people with six carloads of DHS goons who go to somebody's house who owns a Land Rover, which might or might not violate the EPA's emission rules.
[03:22:26.557 --> 03:22:28.738]  So it's an... Did you see the article about two girls?
[03:22:29.378 --> 03:22:36.325]  Fighting with paddles, rowboat paddles, in a front yard so DHS and MRAP showed up?
[03:22:36.726 --> 03:22:38.388]  I mean, this is getting wild.
[03:22:38.968 --> 03:22:48.438]  And you just said it, just like in Katrina, FEMA stood down, cut the police communications to make it as bad as possible, to bring in the army and gun confiscate.
[03:22:48.699 --> 03:22:50.460]  They got their funding roughly doubled.
[03:22:51.021 --> 03:22:51.922]  for emergencies.
[03:22:52.443 --> 03:23:06.583]  So now, by making this as bad as possible, they can come in as the saviors, get even more funding, and legitimize the MRAPs, the helicopters, the drones, all of it, which is really being prepared for the American people.
[03:23:08.300 --> 03:23:08.721]  Exactly.
[03:23:08.741 --> 03:23:14.166]  I mean, a lot of people on the so-called right, conservatives, just don't realise it.
[03:23:14.206 --> 03:23:25.618]  They've been coddled into this belief that this is just a bunch of hoodlums, which granted, it's turning out to be that way because a lot of them have descended on the scene as criminal opportunists.
[03:23:26.199 --> 03:23:26.899]  But, you know, they had
[03:23:27.740 --> 03:23:35.326]  FPS Homeland Security agents guarding Tea Party and anti-IRS rallies earlier this year.
[03:23:35.346 --> 03:23:41.150]  So it's not just trained against, you know, poor black people in these minority communities.
[03:23:41.770 --> 03:23:44.593]  It's destined to be used against everyone.
[03:23:45.467 --> 03:23:55.649]  So, we need to protect everybody's constitutional rights and, you know, try and reach out to those military people and the cops and say that this is going to be directed against their families in the future.
[03:23:56.210 --> 03:24:10.873]  Well, a lot of them know that, Paul, but it's just incrementally rolled out, the warrantless blood checkpoints, the helicopters, the surveillance looking through the walls, the threat fusion centers, all the illegal NSA surveillance.
[03:24:11.513 --> 03:24:14.034]  The point is, the bad guys run the top of the pyramid.
[03:24:14.861 --> 03:24:17.743]  And so it doesn't matter how good the guys are at the bottom or the middle.
[03:24:18.743 --> 03:24:21.645]  This country is being converted into an authoritarian state.
[03:24:22.105 --> 03:24:28.869]  And now the Army would put in a public document that they're preparing to quote, shoot peaceful people.
[03:24:30.330 --> 03:24:33.292]  And to mow down crowds of peaceful people.
[03:24:33.952 --> 03:24:37.734]  The headline should be, Army prepares to legalize Kent State massacres.
[03:24:38.255 --> 03:24:39.836]  This is so sensational.
[03:24:40.951 --> 03:24:48.081]  Army manual prepares premeditated, homicidal, mass murder program.
[03:24:48.982 --> 03:24:50.484]  I mean, that's what this is.
[03:24:50.844 --> 03:24:55.130]  How to shoot unarmed people to create a psychological fear in the public.
[03:24:56.155 --> 03:24:57.676]  I mean, this is war crime stuff.
[03:24:58.236 --> 03:25:02.179]  This is war crimes under the Geneva Convention in a public document.
[03:25:02.459 --> 03:25:04.840]  We've known this has been going on behind the scenes for a while.
[03:25:05.761 --> 03:25:08.883]  But now it's in a public document, Paul Watson.
[03:25:08.923 --> 03:25:13.145]  So more coming out at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:25:14.497 --> 03:25:18.660]  But again, this is pointed at America.
[03:25:18.680 --> 03:25:20.421]  The globalists want the pension funds.
[03:25:20.742 --> 03:25:21.602]  They want the banks.
[03:25:21.642 --> 03:25:23.023]  They want the rural property.
[03:25:23.343 --> 03:25:24.564]  This is agenda 21.
[03:25:24.944 --> 03:25:28.367]  But how do you think they would get the military ready to take over America?
[03:25:28.647 --> 03:25:40.495]  They would have a simulant, a crisis, a pretext, a cover story, a bunch of, you know, rioting gangbangers who just want an excuse to have thug life, writ large, Grand Theft Auto.
[03:25:41.276 --> 03:25:42.197]  And now here it is.
[03:25:43.596 --> 03:25:48.907]  Absolutely scripted, right on time, we predicted it, in everyone's face.
[03:25:49.287 --> 03:25:53.295]  We'll cover it more tonight, 7 o'clock central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:25:53.636 --> 03:25:55.219]  Paul Joseph Watson, anything else?
[03:25:57.066 --> 03:25:58.647]  I mean, it's just pathetic, Alex.
[03:25:59.827 --> 03:26:04.728]  America was the powerhouse of the 20th century, you know, because it helped defeat the Nazis.
[03:26:04.768 --> 03:26:09.070]  And you think of the US Army and Iwo Jima and all those iconic images.
[03:26:10.030 --> 03:26:13.291]  And now they're pointing sniper rifles at journalists.
[03:26:13.671 --> 03:26:15.172]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[03:26:15.552 --> 03:26:16.092]  America's
[03:26:16.832 --> 03:26:26.918]  Crumbling into a banana republic and it was so respected and adored and admired for the entirety of the 20th century and now look at what it's turning into.
[03:26:26.938 --> 03:26:30.840]  It's a banana republic and it's saddening to witness.
[03:26:32.611 --> 03:26:35.312]  And the same thing is happening in England and in Europe and Australia.
[03:26:35.372 --> 03:26:39.694]  It is the same formula of organized crisis and a takeover.
[03:26:40.054 --> 03:26:42.175]  Hopefully, we're smart enough to see what's happening.
[03:26:42.655 --> 03:26:46.677]  We're smart enough to turn this around before it completely degenerates.
[03:26:46.737 --> 03:26:50.659]  Paul Joseph Watson, your article is red-linked at the top of InfoWars.com.
[03:26:50.739 --> 03:26:53.560]  Again, listeners, retweet it from Real Alex Jones.
[03:26:54.100 --> 03:26:56.041]  Retweet it from Prison Planet Live.
[03:26:56.980 --> 03:27:00.183]  Take this video of this live show, send it out to everyone you know.
[03:27:00.524 --> 03:27:10.974]  We'll get it posted tonight early to InfoWars.com so that everyone understands this is the orchestrated, incremental rollout of a permanent martial law state.
[03:27:11.034 --> 03:27:11.955]  Thank you so much.
[03:27:12.395 --> 03:27:12.916]  Paul Watson.
[03:27:13.416 --> 03:27:13.956]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:27:14.416 --> 03:27:21.179]  And thank you to our great crew doing an amazing job today, and thank you to all of you out there for your prayers and your support in these dangerous times.
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:23.340]  Tom in Missouri, and then Billy.
[03:27:23.620 --> 03:27:24.861]  Two final calls quickly.
[03:27:25.141 --> 03:27:28.102]  Tom, former Navy, then we have a military police officer.
[03:27:28.142 --> 03:27:29.203]  Billy, I really want to talk to.
[03:27:29.443 --> 03:27:30.463]  Tom, fast, go.
[03:27:31.804 --> 03:27:34.305]  Alex, hey, I was in Ferguson this weekend.
[03:27:34.565 --> 03:27:36.806]  The feds are running this deal.
[03:27:36.866 --> 03:27:41.268]  I've got pictures of their mobile command center down there at the Target parking lot.
[03:27:42.105 --> 03:27:43.687]  And no one's reporting on it.
[03:27:43.887 --> 03:27:47.830]  All the news agencies are right there and they act like this isn't going on.
[03:27:48.351 --> 03:27:55.577]  There's a great big gray freightliner unmarked mobile command center down there.
[03:27:55.597 --> 03:28:04.425]  There is a meeting out there about 12 o'clock on Saturday with probably 75 individuals, none of them in uniforms.
[03:28:05.026 --> 03:28:08.589]  And then when the one guy was walking away, I did get a picture of one
[03:28:09.287 --> 03:28:10.788]  FBI logo on there.
[03:28:10.808 --> 03:28:12.149]  They're running the show.
[03:28:12.249 --> 03:28:13.410]  It's not the local cops.
[03:28:13.610 --> 03:28:14.810]  Oh, they've been running it day one.
[03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:16.431]  Well, we're aware of that command center.
[03:28:16.752 --> 03:28:18.032]  We're aware the feds are running it.
[03:28:18.092 --> 03:28:21.835]  It's important we send the reporters back there at the target parking lot to show that.
[03:28:22.295 --> 03:28:32.161]  Sir, send us your photos and everybody else's news tips to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com with the authorization to repost it and details so we get our info right, okay?
[03:28:33.161 --> 03:28:34.002]  Biggs has it.
[03:28:34.042 --> 03:28:35.963]  I sent it over to him, but I'll re-send it.
[03:28:36.513 --> 03:28:39.719]  Well, he's been on airplanes and totally overwhelmed and has lost 20 pounds.
[03:28:40.441 --> 03:28:41.643]  So yeah, just send it to everybody.
[03:28:41.683 --> 03:28:42.044]  Thank you.
[03:28:42.344 --> 03:28:43.026]  Thank you so much.
[03:28:43.106 --> 03:28:44.128]  Billy in California.
[03:28:44.388 --> 03:28:47.955]  You're our tail gunner here as we end the live show of Military Police.
[03:28:49.694 --> 03:28:52.415]  Hey Alex, you're right on point with everything you've been talking about.
[03:28:52.915 --> 03:28:54.936]  The feds have been running this from the beginning.
[03:28:55.416 --> 03:28:56.777]  They're starting it up in LA.
[03:28:57.137 --> 03:28:58.597]  They're starting it up in Tennessee.
[03:28:59.578 --> 03:29:03.619]  It's going to be in a neighborhood coming near you soon.
[03:29:03.639 --> 03:29:05.180]  So, you know what, you're right on point.
[03:29:05.940 --> 03:29:10.962]  They just want to bring in the MRAPs and bring in the full-auto weapons and start the war.
[03:29:11.242 --> 03:29:11.942]  That's what they want.
[03:29:13.063 --> 03:29:18.545]  And then Obama will pose as the savior trying to fix it and telling us if we're more politically correct this will all stop.
[03:29:20.223 --> 03:29:21.384]  Exactly, and you know what?
[03:29:21.985 --> 03:29:26.270]  I've heard kind of a biblical note sometimes, and you're right on point.
[03:29:26.290 --> 03:29:27.511]  We haven't humbled ourselves.
[03:29:27.911 --> 03:29:31.575]  We haven't looked for God, and our land will not be healed.
[03:29:31.976 --> 03:29:35.780]  It's going to go into ruin, just like it says, and that's where it's going.
[03:29:36.580 --> 03:29:37.722]  Wow, I could talk to you for an hour.
[03:29:37.762 --> 03:29:38.562]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[03:29:38.843 --> 03:29:39.624]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:29:39.644 --> 03:29:40.504]  I'll try to get to you quicker.
[03:29:40.545 --> 03:29:41.025]  Okay, Billy?
[03:29:42.226 --> 03:29:42.727]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:29:43.593 --> 03:29:44.754]  Alright, great job crew.
[03:29:44.854 --> 03:29:46.915]  Again, I'm humbled to even be on the air covering all this.
[03:29:47.396 --> 03:29:48.236]  But we've predicted it.
[03:29:48.256 --> 03:29:50.738]  It's not hard to predict it when you know the game plan.
[03:29:51.258 --> 03:29:53.139]  They're playing everybody off against each other.
[03:29:54.400 --> 03:29:58.323]  We do not need any terrorism, I'll tell you that right now, but they're gonna stage it and blame it on us.
[03:29:58.503 --> 03:30:00.664]  We need non-violence.
[03:30:00.684 --> 03:30:01.545]  Non-violence.
[03:30:01.845 --> 03:30:02.406]  Non-violence.
[03:30:02.446 --> 03:30:05.268]  Alright, great job with the crew.
[03:30:05.288 --> 03:30:06.508]  Nightly News, I'll be on it tonight at 7.
[03:30:10.464 --> 03:30:11.306]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:30:11.466 --> 03:30:13.509]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources.
[03:30:14.190 --> 03:30:15.853]  Filtered City of Austin tap water.
[03:30:15.953 --> 03:30:17.155]  I didn't like taste dirt in it.
[03:30:17.195 --> 03:30:18.217]  God knows what's in there.
