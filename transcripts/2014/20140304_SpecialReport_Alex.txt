[00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:15.662]  They say any press is good press, but when it comes to Obamacare, brand-conscious celebs just aren't willing to back this PR disaster.
[00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:23.290]  In spite of the intention to enlist celebrities for a landmark social media blitz, The Hill reports that Obamacare's stars are fading.
[00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.421]  With A-list backers mainly sticking to Twitter to voice support for Obamacare, while others have just only appeared in inexpensive online videos.
[00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:38.892]  Or they've chosen to promote California's insurance marketplace instead of the notoriously troubled website healthcare.gov.
[00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:43.355]  And celebrity endorsements are necessary to counter these dismal poll numbers.
[00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:48.439]  Support for Obamacare is dropping, and especially among its target constituencies.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:01:00.990]  Millennials, the group so necessary to the Affordable Care Act's success, are largely disaffected with Obama and his health care law, with nearly half thinking their expenses will rise while their quality of care will fall.
[00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.911]  Support for the health care law declined among the uninsured this month, who are supposed to be its primary beneficiaries.
[00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:19.094]  Perhaps more troubling for Obama as he tries to rebrand and resell Obamacare is the Kaiser Health tracking poll that found that Obamacare is losing support among women and Democrats.
[00:01:19.574 --> 00:01:25.056]  48% of women find it unfavorable and approval ratings among Democrats saw a 15% drop in one month.
[00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:33.984]  The problem for Obama is that now Americans can actually see and suffer through what Obamacare actually is.
[00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:46.099]  No amount of good PR can change the fact that in Georgia, the fourth hospital in two years is shutting its doors due to severe financial difficulties caused by Obamacare's payment cuts for emergency services.
[00:01:46.739 --> 00:02:02.329]  And A-listers won't be able to quell the rate shock that consumers are experiencing once they do sign up for the Affordable Care Act, including a 539% increase for a couple in Texas and increased premiums for 11 million workers, according to Fox News.
[00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:13.375]  These rate hikes even prompted liberal blogger Terj Capps to express his outrage over his family's rate increase, saying, I'm canceling insurance for us and I'm not paying any penalty.
[00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:15.677]  What the hell kind of reform is this?
[00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:17.038]  Exactly.
[00:02:17.158 --> 00:02:18.720]  Because it's not a reform.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.741]  It's a subsidy.
[00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:25.267]  A mandate that forces you to turn over even more of your paycheck to insurance companies.
[00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:26.128]  Or else.
[00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.554]  One celebrity tweeting about Obamacare is former MSNBC host Dylan Rattigan.
[00:02:32.034 --> 00:02:36.497]  He had his insurance cancelled thanks to Obamacare and he wasn't pleased about it.
[00:02:36.937 --> 00:02:44.782]  And now experts predict almost 80 million people with employer health care plans could have coverage cancelled because they aren't compliant with Obamacare.
[00:02:45.102 --> 00:02:50.906]  Those losses would be in addition to the millions who've already lost their individual coverage for the same reason.
[00:02:51.507 --> 00:03:01.273]  But Vice President Joe Biden thinks it's great that Obamacare is going to cost 2 million jobs because now women can stay at home and make their husbands a sandwich or something.
[00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:02.653]  This is about freedom.
[00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:08.415]  How many of you are single women with children in a dead-end job?
[00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.076]  You're there because of your health insurance.
[00:03:11.796 --> 00:03:19.478]  You would rather have the opportunity to spend the next couple years with your child till they get, if that was your choice, till they get into primary school.
[00:03:20.278 --> 00:03:24.500]  You're now trapped in that job because if you leave, you lose your health insurance.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.481]  Now, you'll be able to make an independent choice.
[00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:33.405]  And here's what another celeb thinks of Obama's signature legislation.
[00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:40.953]  You know, I'm a socialist enough that I want everybody to have access to healthcare, poor or rich.
[00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:45.798]  You know, that old line, the rich should live and the poor should die.
[00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.239]  I'm not for that.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.344]  But I think when you turn something over to one industry,
[00:03:52.124 --> 00:03:55.106]  As opposed to another industry, they're going to do what's self-serving.
[00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:58.948]  You know, the bill seems, you know, incredibly complex.
[00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:00.729]  And why are they getting exemptions?
[00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.853]  And why is Congress not participating in the same kind of system as everybody else is?
[00:04:05.873 --> 00:04:09.735]  You know, I really think that it's a big, big, big bullocks.
[00:04:10.456 --> 00:04:13.419]  Obamacare doesn't need to be rebranded and resold.
[00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.260]  It needs to be repealed.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.107]  How many more millions of Americans need to lose their health insurance and doctors that they like just because the government doesn't like their insurance?
