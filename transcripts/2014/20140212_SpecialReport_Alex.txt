[00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.180]  Talk about trashing the American dream.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.062]  A Texas professor is going to be living inside of a dumpster for the next year.
[00:00:14.422 --> 00:00:24.907]  Dr. Jeff Wilson moved into his new digs on Tuesday in an experiment designed to show students and the world that humans can live on a smaller scale and lessen our environmental footprint.
[00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:35.432]  Outfitting the tiny space is step one in this trash can challenge, and the goal is to design the dumpster to be as energy efficient as possible, with solar panels and an energy-producing toilet.
[00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:45.400]  Wilson jokes he's part of the 1%, saying his space is 1% the living space of the average American home, using just 1% the water, energy and waste.
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:54.187]  Professor Dumpster, as he's lovingly referred to by his students, says the idea here is to ultimately show one can have a pretty good life in a dumpster.
[00:00:55.427 --> 00:01:03.353]  Oh, and the dumpster diving professor says that he's going to be transforming his trashy home into a capsule hotel by the end of the year.
[00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:13.781]  Much like the kind being called home in Japan, built for salary men who missed the last train home, tiny capsule hotels are now the homes of last resort for Japan's unemployed.
[00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:22.467]  Looking more like a stack of washing machines, they're 6.5 foot by 5 foot rooms that contain a bed, a TV and a pair of coat hooks.
[00:01:22.907 --> 00:01:31.433]  But it seems the professor is just preparing the community for the coming tiny apartments that cities are toying with as an answer to overcrowding and the need for affordable housing.
[00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:38.118]  Micro-units, apartments of 500 square feet or less, might be Austin's next big building trend.
[00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:51.147]  The only trend that I'm seeing here is that for those of us who can't afford it, the answer is to just shove us into tiny little boxes like a can of sardines and then just culturally normalize it so we don't realize that we're actually being caged.
[00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:57.251]  Recent studies show that living in tiny spaces can actually be sizably hazardous to your health.
[00:01:57.611 --> 00:02:09.540]  According to Dal Kopek, director of design for human health at Boston Architectural College, the space-saving trend of tiny apartments can lead to increased claustrophobia, domestic abuse and alcoholism.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.103]  On top of that, researchers believe that children need bigger spaces to flourish.
[00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:20.488]  They say children raised in confined spaces can end up becoming withdrawn and have trouble studying and concentrating.
[00:02:20.628 --> 00:02:24.971]  Professor Wilson's dumpster has a stench of Agenda 21 all over it.
[00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.873]  That's the globalist plan for the 21st century.
[00:02:28.334 --> 00:02:32.016]  It's not what is Agenda 21, it's almost what isn't.
[00:02:32.357 --> 00:02:34.038]  It is the blueprint.
[00:02:34.218 --> 00:02:39.442]  It is the action plan to inventory and control all land,
[00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:53.990]  All water, all plants, all minerals, all construction, all animals, all means of production, all energy, all information and all human beings in the world.
[00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.331]  It is a completely comprehensive plan.
[00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:00.892]  It's global and it's implemented locally.
[00:03:01.252 --> 00:03:10.601]  This map, entitled The Simulated Reserve and Corridor System to Protect Biodiversity, illustrates how the UN's Agenda 21 plan would work in the United States.
[00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:15.525]  Under this takeover, all personal property rights would cease to exist.
[00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:20.009]  The majority of the map is red-zoned, mandated for little to no human use.
[00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.613]  Yellow zones are buffer zones for highly regulated use.
[00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:28.034]  Only in the scant green areas is normal human use allowed.
[00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:41.838]  The tiny black dots are the dense megacities where transportation will be tightly controlled, freedom will be restricted, and people will be packed in like sardines living in tiny units no bigger than a jail cell.
[00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:43.338]  Wake up, America!
[00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:51.060]  Under Agenda 21, in the name of sustainability, we are building our own prisons for the greater good.
