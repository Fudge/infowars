[00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.481]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:28.902]  I'm David Knight and it's July 3rd, 2014.
[00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:29.883]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:30.083]  Tonight.
[00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:40.818]  The TSA will celebrate the 4th of July by violating your 4th Amendment.
[00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:43.719]  Then, what do you have to hide?
[00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.141]  Visiting privacy websites gets you put in a NSA database.
[00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:52.483]  And another economist says war is the health of the state.
[00:00:53.023 --> 00:00:56.544]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:00.486]  Hardcore savage death machines ready to kill you and your family.
[00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:01.506]  They can't wait.
[00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:03.367]  They're gonna murder all of us dead or tonight.
[00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:08.889]  Well, tomorrow is the 238th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
[00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.531]  Now, a lot of people travel on the 4th of July.
[00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:13.813]  Obama just unveiled a new highway bill.
[00:01:13.893 --> 00:01:16.816]  How is that going to affect you on future 4th of Julys?
[00:01:17.217 --> 00:01:20.220]  We're also going to look at what's happening with our military.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.062]  Both abroad and how are we treating our veterans?
[00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:25.544]  Has America become the new empire?
[00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:28.766]  But first, let's take a look at the Declaration of Independence itself.
[00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:30.027]  It's actually in the news.
[00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:36.191]  The New York Times is wondering about this period that is maybe there and maybe isn't.
[00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.314]  They say, if only Thomas Jefferson could settle the issue.
[00:01:39.354 --> 00:01:41.875]  Well, you know, Jefferson had something to say about it.
[00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:45.198]  He says, I set out on this ground which I suppose to be self-evident.
[00:01:45.598 --> 00:01:48.060]  Not just using that phrase in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:51.123]  He says, the earth belongs to the living.
[00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.906]  The dead have neither powers nor rights over it.
[00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:56.789]  It's up for us to decide how we want to live.
[00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.771]  Now, of course, the Declaration of Independence is an important document.
[00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:01.193]  It was a founding document.
[00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:03.915]  It was a document of secession.
[00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:11.319]  And it was based on whether or not the government was recognizing the rights that we possess as human beings.
[00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.300]  Was it securing those rights?
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.161]  Or was it destroying those rights?
[00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:18.342]  But the discussion is now focusing on this period.
[00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:29.388]  If you've ever memorized the Declaration of Independence, and I'm sure as a child in school they had you memorize the first part of the first paragraph, they had you stop after the pursuit of happiness.
[00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:32.648]  That's not really the way it was written, I believe.
[00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:40.730]  I think that it's very clear that it has subordinate clauses to it that he's laying out a whole list of what the government is supposed to do.
[00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.870]  But this is what a scholar from Princeton is saying.
[00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.291]  This is Danielle Allen.
[00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:53.592]  She says, a period that appears right after the phrase, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the transcript is certainly not, she maintains, on the badly faded parchment original.
[00:02:54.032 --> 00:02:55.373]  And this is what she says about it.
[00:02:55.413 --> 00:02:56.693]  She says, the logic of the sentence
[00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:03.256]  Moves from the value of individual rights to the importance of government as a tool for protecting those rights.
[00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:08.459]  If you lose that connection when the period gets added, I don't think that's the case.
[00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:16.243]  I think if you look at the actual language, it talks about, this is all in the first paragraph, it says that all men are created equal.
[00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:19.945]  Then it says that governments are instituted to secure these rights.
[00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:23.847]  Then it says that when they become destructive of the rights, we alter or abolish them.
[00:03:24.207 --> 00:03:25.708]  Those are the three phrases.
[00:03:26.288 --> 00:03:29.770]  That's the progression of logic that follows in that first sentence.
[00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.111]  There's three that's.
[00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:32.471]  That, that, that.
[00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:34.052]  That men are created equal.
[00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:36.293]  That government is there to secure those rights.
[00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:40.836]  And that we have a right and a duty to get rid of governments that don't secure those rights.
[00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:45.718]  You know, we have had theologians who argue about how many angels can fit on the head of a pen.
[00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:48.600]  We've now got lawyers arguing about whether or not there's a period there.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.181]  We can read the document for ourselves.
[00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:53.022]  Read it for yourself tomorrow.
[00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:54.223]  And for your family.
[00:03:54.983 --> 00:03:58.906]  Well, you know, the government is always trying to reinterpret the plain language.
[00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:01.608]  Maybe they don't want us to even speak English.
[00:04:01.988 --> 00:04:02.768]  Look at this article.
[00:04:02.848 --> 00:04:07.772]  Federal government sues Wisconsin company and says English language requirement is discrimination.
[00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:21.021]  The EEOC, a federal agency tasked with enforcing workplace discrimination laws, is suing a private American business because they fired a group of Hispanic and Asian employees because they couldn't speak English at work.
[00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:28.465]  Now Judicial Watch, Irene Garcia, the blog editor and the Spanish media liaison for them, called the accusation ludicrous.
[00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:32.227]  She says, it's ludicrous and an overreaching of government.
[00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:37.730]  If you're a private company in the U.S., you should be able to require your employees to speak English.
[00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.432]  Well, it's not just being able to speak English.
[00:04:40.753 --> 00:04:45.558]  It's also forgetting our history, and not just the Declaration of Independence, our recent history.
[00:04:45.998 --> 00:04:52.045]  Look at what the BBC reporter is saying about this new Google moving to suppress legitimate journalism.
[00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:54.448]  This is an article from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:54.688 --> 00:04:59.834]  This is in response, of course, to the recent legislation in the EU, the right to be forgotten ruling.
[00:05:00.254 --> 00:05:01.995]  Paul Joseph Watson gives us a background.
[00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:22.470]  He says a recent ruling in the European Court of Justice mandated that Google must delete, quote, inadequate, irrelevant, and no longer relevant data when it receives a request to do so, which could open the floodgates for powerful individuals, corporations, and institutions to hide past evidence of wrongdoing and a chilling throwback to George Orwell's memory hole.
[00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.731]  Precisely.
[00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:36.582]  Now in this particular case, we've got the BBC economics editor Robert Preston, who says that he had an article that was taken out, a 2007 article about a former Merrill Lynch boss, Stan O'Neill, and his role in the financial collapse.
[00:05:37.102 --> 00:05:41.526]  Now understand, Google will still have that information, the public just won't have that information.
[00:05:41.986 --> 00:05:46.368]  So essentially what they're doing is they're destroying people's rights to publish.
[00:05:46.928 --> 00:05:50.189]  And they're also doing the same as if they had a prior constraint.
[00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:52.370]  This is a post-constraint of free speech.
[00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.791]  This is taking away something in 2014 that was written in 2007.
[00:05:55.931 --> 00:06:00.752]  It's still censorship being performed in the name of privacy.
[00:06:01.032 --> 00:06:02.393]  The London Guardian had it right.
[00:06:02.853 --> 00:06:14.540]  They said that six of their articles had vanished down the memory hole, and they said there will likely be many more as the rich and powerful look to scrub their online images, doubtless with the help of a new wave of reputation management firms.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.822]  And they point out that this should reside with the people who are publishing the information.
[00:06:20.203 --> 00:06:25.606]  If it's a Guardian article, if it's an InfoWars article, somebody has a problem with what's there, we already have
[00:06:26.326 --> 00:06:27.988]  Rules that can take that down.
[00:06:28.068 --> 00:06:33.153]  If something is said about somebody that is not true, that's slander or libel.
[00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:35.075]  You have a court process to handle that.
[00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:41.601]  We should not be able to have a third party or the government censor information that other people have written.
[00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:42.722]  And that's what's going to happen.
[00:06:42.762 --> 00:06:47.206]  If you can't find it online, it essentially hasn't been published or it's been de-published.
[00:06:47.952 --> 00:06:50.954]  Now we also have other news in terms of websites.
[00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:57.458]  We now see that the NSA is looking at people who have even Googled on how they can get their privacy.
[00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:02.642]  Now while they're trying to justify an Orwellian memory hole in the name of privacy, look at the hypocrisy.
[00:07:03.182 --> 00:07:13.109]  Merely visiting a website to find out how you can keep your actions private from the NSA and other spies gets you on a list of extremists.
[00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:15.030]  This is an article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.692]  He points out in an article for the German news outlet
[00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:32.646]  It reveals how the NSA's Deep Packet Inspection Rules, which it uses to determine who to target for deep surveillance, includes looking at web users who search for articles about Tor and Tails, anonymous browser and privacy-friendly operating systems.
[00:07:33.126 --> 00:07:40.132]  Anybody who actually looks at how they can protect their privacy is now considered to be an extremist.
[00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:42.214]  It makes you an enemy of the state.
[00:07:43.035 --> 00:07:53.939]  And also on this 4th of July weekend, we see that the TSA is now striking up fear of traveling as they've opened up the borders for everyone and anything to come in over the borders.
[00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:57.840]  Now they're going to step up the examinations at the airports.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.921]  TSA plans enhanced security for 4th of July travelers.
[00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:09.444]  In an article by Kurt Nemo, he writes that Saudi and CIA-supported terrorists are now being determined to disrupt the 4th of July holiday.
[00:08:09.464 --> 00:08:12.205]  I guess they just hate us for our freedoms.
[00:08:12.865 --> 00:08:14.366]  Or maybe that's the Feds.
[00:08:15.347 --> 00:08:23.794]  Now, this week, of course, is a heavy traveling weekend for most people in the United States, and Obama released a new highway funding program this week.
[00:08:24.154 --> 00:08:30.500]  Now, when he released it, he said that it's not socialism, and it's not an imperial presidency, and it's not crazy.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:39.847]  But I kind of remember a time when big spending bills and appropriations originated in the House like it did in the Constitution.
[00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:47.054]  This is an important bill because we've had a lot of jobs that have come back since the major recession.
[00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:54.561]  There's been a 12% increase in transportation jobs, and that includes airports, trucks, as well as rail.
[00:08:54.862 --> 00:08:59.526]  There's four and a half million people that work in that sector, not even counting taxis.
[00:09:00.347 --> 00:09:07.031]  But of course, as you look at these job figures, we know that they're constantly rigging the figures, they're constantly readjusting these figures.
[00:09:07.732 --> 00:09:10.613]  Still, it's a major portion of the economy.
[00:09:11.514 --> 00:09:18.118]  And so, when Obama says that our infrastructure is decaying, and it truly is decaying, what's he going to do about it?
[00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:24.762]  Well, he's seizing the initiative on it without waiting for Congress, and of course, Congress is passively setting back and letting him do it.
[00:09:25.382 --> 00:09:29.005]  The mainstream media has been preparing the way for this for quite some time.
[00:09:29.545 --> 00:09:36.109]  For a number of weeks, they've been talking about increases in federal gas taxes, saying that they're going to increase it by 12 cents.
[00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:37.550]  12 cents.
[00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.912]  No, it's actually 12 cents on an 18-cent base.
[00:09:41.452 --> 00:09:44.934]  That's a 67% increase in your gas taxes.
[00:09:44.994 --> 00:09:51.018]  And understand that when they increase the gas taxes with federal taxes, and everybody is aware there's going to be a jump at the pump,
[00:09:51.638 --> 00:09:53.641]  Then they're going to increase it at the state level.
[00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:57.866]  And the companies that are providing gasoline to you are going to increase their prices.
[00:09:58.346 --> 00:10:02.452]  Everyone is going to say, including these transportation companies, that now their costs have gone up.
[00:10:02.492 --> 00:10:04.955]  So they're going to raise the costs everywhere.
[00:10:04.975 --> 00:10:08.099]  You're going to see a massive increase in inflation.
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.442]  But look at how they're going to pay for it.
[00:10:10.802 --> 00:10:17.327]  We only have, the only House involvement that we've got is a House plan to change tax structure.
[00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:19.249]  That's coming from the House GOP.
[00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:22.992]  This is Republican Chairman of the Tax Writing House Ways and Means Committee.
[00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:29.197]  He unveiled a bold but politically hazardous overhaul of the nation's tax laws according to the Washington Post.
[00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:34.581]  He's doing things like getting rid of all personal exemptions for you, for your spouse, for your dependents.
[00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:36.003]  No more credit for child care.
[00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:39.606]  No more deductions for medical bills, for state or local taxes.
[00:10:39.986 --> 00:10:45.030]  Any mortgage interest deductions will be taken away if the mortgage is worth more than $500,000.
[00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:49.074]  Now that may sound like a lot, but I remember a time when
[00:10:49.614 --> 00:10:53.856]  The average or the median price of homes was one-tenth of what it is today.
[00:10:54.356 --> 00:11:05.462]  Inflation comes about very quickly, and when we have an inflationary tax structure, when we have a 67% increase in our gasoline taxes, that's going to fuel that kind of inflation.
[00:11:05.842 --> 00:11:13.428]  Now the Washington Post points out that K Street lobbyists are very busy opposing this, and it really doesn't have a chance of passing.
[00:11:13.508 --> 00:11:17.391]  So of course it is going to go through that 67% tax increase.
[00:11:17.732 --> 00:11:20.294]  But let's look at not only how much it's going to cost,
[00:11:20.854 --> 00:11:22.735]  But what they're going to buy with it.
[00:11:23.255 --> 00:11:31.338]  The White House put out a fact sheet talking about President Obama laying out his vision for 21st century transportation infrastructure.
[00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:33.979]  That sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.161]  Sounds like Agenda 21 and yes it is in there.
[00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:39.522]  When he says this is not socialism,
[00:11:40.464 --> 00:11:42.024]  This is what he's talking about.
[00:11:42.044 --> 00:11:46.326]  He knows that people are going to criticize this because it is socialist planning.
[00:11:46.646 --> 00:11:49.626]  This is $302 billion that they're going to put in.
[00:11:49.927 --> 00:11:54.808]  And one of the very first line items on his fact sheet is Tiger Competitive Grants.
[00:11:55.428 --> 00:12:01.210]  Now, maybe you haven't heard about those, but this is something that they've used to build transportation infrastructure.
[00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:02.430]  Or is it?
[00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:13.758]  No, actually, if you go back to March 22nd, Reason Foundation had an interesting article about what these TIGER grants are doing and how they're not really tied to transportation.
[00:12:14.198 --> 00:12:22.184]  In this particular article, they talk about the city of Fresno, California that's decided to try to revive a mall that's fallen into a dilapidated state.
[00:12:22.964 --> 00:12:26.985]  They got transportation funds of 15 million dollars.
[00:12:27.605 --> 00:12:30.546]  Now he's got earmarked for the Tiger competitive grants.
[00:12:30.586 --> 00:12:32.227]  He's got 600 million dollars.
[00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:35.268]  So he could do one of these pretty much in nearly every state.
[00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:45.331]  Now one of the things about this that they loosely tied this into transportation with was that this mall was close to the hub of a California high-speed rail system.
[00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:52.375]  Now the authorities trying to get money to build this high-speed rail system because that's always the dream of the government.
[00:12:52.516 --> 00:12:55.122]  They always want to control your transportation.
[00:12:55.655 --> 00:12:57.976]  They don't want you to be independent in your own car.
[00:12:58.016 --> 00:13:01.698]  They want to put you in buses, especially into light rail.
[00:13:01.738 --> 00:13:03.058]  That's always been their dream.
[00:13:03.838 --> 00:13:10.661]  Problem is that in California, the only funds that the high-speed rail line has received is $3.5 billion from the feds.
[00:13:11.402 --> 00:13:14.743]  And the initial operating section alone is going to require $31 billion.
[00:13:17.344 --> 00:13:18.184]  But it's worse than that.
[00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:19.865]  Go back to his fact sheet.
[00:13:20.246 --> 00:13:21.146]  Look at the bottom of it.
[00:13:21.406 --> 00:13:26.169]  It says $4 billion to attract private investment in transportation infrastructure.
[00:13:26.609 --> 00:13:29.550]  Now, why would he have to attract private investment if it's a good deal?
[00:13:29.911 --> 00:13:34.853]  But of course, this is money that's going to be going to his crony capitalist friends and to bankers.
[00:13:34.913 --> 00:13:36.054]  Listen to how he describes it.
[00:13:36.334 --> 00:13:39.255]  He's going to capitalize a national infrastructure bank.
[00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.437]  He's going to create American fast-forward bonds.
[00:13:42.957 --> 00:13:43.378]  There we go.
[00:13:44.298 --> 00:13:45.699]  It's going to be for the bankers.
[00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:47.300]  And what are they going to build with it?
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.684]  Well, it's going to be light rail systems and it's going to be regional transportation systems.
[00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:54.666]  A good example of that is what's going on in Florida.
[00:13:54.686 --> 00:14:02.812]  They have a project, 750, that's the word 7 and the number 50, that's been opposed by people in Florida for quite some time now.
[00:14:03.413 --> 00:14:08.917]  And the Palm Beach Post reported back on February the 4th of this year that the people were essentially up in arms.
[00:14:08.937 --> 00:14:10.258]  They had to call extra deputies.
[00:14:10.718 --> 00:14:13.579]  One was ejected from the Palm Beach County Commission meeting.
[00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:19.402]  Nearly 80 people showed up wearing red t-shirts to show solidarity, waving tiny American flags.
[00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:23.904]  They packed the county commission chambers because they're in opposition to this plan.
[00:14:24.284 --> 00:14:24.584]  Why?
[00:14:24.984 --> 00:14:29.666]  Because they said it's a giant step in the systematic erosion of property rights.
[00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:32.347]  Yes, exactly like Agenda 21.
[00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:43.050]  A mayor who went to one of their plans, a Mayor Craig Fletcher, who attended one of the briefings given by the proponents of 750, reported that city and county government would be less important.
[00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.071]  Only mega regions are important, just like in the EU.
[00:14:47.671 --> 00:14:51.832]  The seven Florida counties that are part of the partnership would have someone to control them.
[00:14:52.532 --> 00:15:02.041]  They are not going to put up with the American education system and he says, quote, fascism is the best form of government to implement these changes.
[00:15:02.521 --> 00:15:03.963]  That's what we're going to see with that.
[00:15:04.263 --> 00:15:05.964]  That's what Obama's plan is.
[00:15:06.065 --> 00:15:07.346]  It's corporate fascism.
[00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:09.007]  It's crony capitalism.
[00:15:09.388 --> 00:15:14.953]  It's paying off his big donors and the big banks to create agenda 21 type of projects.
[00:15:15.493 --> 00:15:21.697]  This is, if you look at their own writings, they claim that it's going to have more jobs, better transit, climate response.
[00:15:22.257 --> 00:15:23.898]  Yes, that's what Obama's plan for 21st century
[00:15:36.525 --> 00:15:37.865]  Transportation is about.
[00:15:38.325 --> 00:15:40.006]  It's simply Agenda 21.
[00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:42.906]  And he's doing it without the Congress.
[00:15:43.366 --> 00:15:49.788]  He's creating a $300 billion expenditure that is not originating in the House, as the Constitution says.
[00:15:50.168 --> 00:15:55.789]  He's going to do it, and he's going to have the grants, the TIGER grants, that he's going to allocate to his buddies.
[00:15:56.129 --> 00:15:59.550]  And he's selling it as a way to fix our decaying infrastructure.
[00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.311]  He's going to tell you that he's rebuilding the roads and the collapsing bridges.
[00:16:04.952 --> 00:16:09.873]  Now, one more look at his fact sheet, because he says this isn't an imperial presidency.
[00:16:10.153 --> 00:16:20.436]  But reading from his fact sheet, he says he wants to institutionalize best practices and insights from the president's previous executive orders and presidential memorandums.
[00:16:21.296 --> 00:16:26.558]  See, when Obama says that this is not about an imperial presidency,
[00:16:27.418 --> 00:16:30.240]  It's all about his, he knows he's got executive orders buried in there.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:37.125]  When he says it's not about socialism, he knows he's laying out a plan for Agenda 21, and that's precisely what this is.
[00:16:37.845 --> 00:16:52.336]  Now finally today, one of the reasons that the colonists declared their independence from, and seceded from, the British Empire, was because it was at a constant state of war, just like all the nations of Europe at that time.
[00:16:53.058 --> 00:16:59.145]  I guess the questions we need to ask are, has America become an empire that is constantly at war?
[00:16:59.325 --> 00:17:00.386]  Certainly that is the case.
[00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:01.267]  It's World War II.
[00:17:01.868 --> 00:17:12.619]  And now we see on Infowars a very detailed article attacking the idea that this broken windows is a way to increase the economy, to make people wealthy.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:19.401]  Another idiot economist says that we need a major war to save the economy, and this is from George Washington's blog.
[00:17:19.441 --> 00:17:29.784]  I'm not going to go over the details of this article, because just to print it out, it's about 15 pages long, but it's a very detailed refutation of what economists call the broken window fallacy.
[00:17:29.824 --> 00:17:35.525]  The idea that something like a hurricane is good for the economy, or a war is good for the economy.
[00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:44.895]  I just recently saw Jersey Boys and it was interesting at the very beginning this kid who talked about his childhood and how he was corrupted and got into the mob and got into crime.
[00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:50.041]  His job was to go around and break windows so they could sell new windows.
[00:17:50.842 --> 00:17:55.823]  It didn't benefit anybody but the guy who was breaking the windows and selling the new windows.
[00:17:55.883 --> 00:17:57.724]  It didn't help the restaurants or the other businesses.
[00:17:57.784 --> 00:18:02.665]  It didn't help a restaurant to get more salaries or wages for themselves or their employees.
[00:18:02.985 --> 00:18:09.447]  It didn't help them to provide better services, better quality food at a lower price so they can compete better, so they could offer better services to people.
[00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:12.628]  No, it simply helped the person who was breaking the window.
[00:18:13.268 --> 00:18:18.690]  And just like organized crime, that's the way the military-industrial complex works.
[00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:23.934]  Argument that war benefits the economy is the same argument.
[00:18:24.015 --> 00:18:26.517]  It only benefits those who are creating the war.
[00:18:26.557 --> 00:18:32.003]  But unlike this guy who is breaking windows, they're killing people in massive amounts.
[00:18:32.183 --> 00:18:33.485]  And that makes it even worse.
[00:18:33.925 --> 00:18:38.770]  And we also learned today that the Pentagon reveals that it's had a secret military presence in Somalia.
[00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:44.592]  Since 2007, they're just now admitting that they've been there constantly.
[00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:51.073]  Someone has leaked that they have 120 people that have been staying on the ground throughout in Somalia.
[00:18:51.573 --> 00:18:58.935]  Yet another example of how we have a foot in every war and how the military-industrial complex runs this country.
[00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:05.356]  But how do they treat the soldiers who fight for this government that is constantly at war with everyone?
[00:19:05.856 --> 00:19:07.437]  Look at this article about the VA.
[00:19:07.557 --> 00:19:14.202]  VA workers rip crucifix off dying vets neck, deal crack, rape and many more.
[00:19:14.242 --> 00:19:21.908]  Now this is an audit report and it was pulled out, there were highlighted sections of that from US Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma.
[00:19:22.702 --> 00:19:31.387]  More than 1,000 veterans may have died at the hands of the Department of Veterans Affairs, even as the agency was beset with shocking instances of employee misconduct.
[00:19:31.987 --> 00:19:36.189]  They talk about all these things that I mentioned in the headlines, plus they had this revelation.
[00:19:36.229 --> 00:19:44.694]  They said a nurse working at the VA hospital in Kentucky pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter after being charged with killing a World War II vet.
[00:19:45.194 --> 00:19:56.321]  A 90-year-old veteran died from a lethal dose of morphine, and according to the report, at least two other veterans cared for by the same nurse died under the same suspicious circumstances.
[00:19:57.001 --> 00:19:58.502]  What was the punishment for this nurse?
[00:19:59.143 --> 00:20:01.905]  She was sentenced to time served of eight days.
[00:20:02.665 --> 00:20:03.205]  Eight days.
[00:20:03.646 --> 00:20:04.606]  Eight days.
[00:20:05.086 --> 00:20:11.189]  She's engaged in, it looks like she's engaged in euthanasia and mercy killings of 90-year-olds.
[00:20:11.749 --> 00:20:14.451]  It's horrific the way we treat the veterans in this country.
[00:20:14.871 --> 00:20:27.217]  We need to treat them at least as well as we do the illegal aliens that are flooding into our country as the government opens the borders and takes down our homeland in the name of homeland security.
[00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:29.671]  We're going to be right back after the break.
[00:20:29.711 --> 00:20:36.578]  We've got an interview with someone who does take his rights seriously, who has stood up for them, and who got arrested for it.
[00:20:36.598 --> 00:20:42.984]  21-year-old Danny Martins has vigorously been standing up for his right to address his grievances to protest.
[00:20:43.565 --> 00:20:44.445]  And what did he get for it?
[00:20:44.526 --> 00:20:46.187]  Well, he just recently got arrested.
[00:20:46.568 --> 00:20:48.870]  We're going to be talking to him right after the break.
[00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.731]  Stay with us.
[00:20:56.007 --> 00:21:01.592]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:21:01.812 --> 00:21:09.018]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:21:09.178 --> 00:21:12.381]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supplies.
[00:21:12.541 --> 00:21:14.323]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:21:14.563 --> 00:21:19.148]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:21:19.228 --> 00:21:21.991]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:21:22.152 --> 00:21:27.938]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:21:28.098 --> 00:21:31.581]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[00:21:31.761 --> 00:21:40.068]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:40.248 --> 00:21:46.113]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:21:46.233 --> 00:21:48.215]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[00:21:48.395 --> 00:21:53.199]  Secure your super high quality nascent iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:55.280]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:59.864 --> 00:22:07.030]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.312]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:22:09.512 --> 00:22:14.696]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:19.940]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.181]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:22:23.461 --> 00:22:27.382]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:22:27.602 --> 00:22:31.903]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:22:32.003 --> 00:22:42.145]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:22:42.345 --> 00:22:46.586]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:22:46.826 --> 00:22:53.253]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:22:53.434 --> 00:22:57.418]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:18.178]  Last week I talked to a Border Patrol Union Rep in El Paso, Texas, who tried to contact the CDC.
[00:23:18.618 --> 00:23:22.940]  And he said that, hey, we've got these diseases coming across the border, could you help us out?
[00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:27.443]  Or at least give us some kind of direction, some information on what it is we can do.
[00:23:28.303 --> 00:23:30.845]  And they pretty much said that that's not their job.
[00:23:31.225 --> 00:23:40.973]  So right now, we have Border Patrol agents who are just EMTs screening these kids coming across for diseases and they don't really have the training to deal with that.
[00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:46.637]  So when I got back here to Austin, I decided to call the CDC myself and ask them a few questions.
[00:23:46.657 --> 00:23:51.421]  You know, I got on and I spoke to a lady that worked for them and I said, you know, why aren't you down here?
[00:23:51.721 --> 00:23:52.902]  Don't you think this is important?
[00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:55.644]  And at what point do you step in and do your job?
[00:23:56.465 --> 00:24:03.888]  She, you know, rattled off some mumbo-jumbo thing that's been typed up for her to say already, and basically didn't give me anything like that.
[00:24:03.948 --> 00:24:13.073]  So once that video was put out, it made it on Drudge, and a lot of people have ended up calling the CDC themselves with concern, saying, hey, you need to take this into consideration.
[00:24:13.113 --> 00:24:14.413]  This is a very big problem.
[00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:19.756]  You know, we have swine flu that's made it all the way up to San Antonio, to Lackland Air Force Base.
[00:24:20.116 --> 00:24:24.258]  We have possible cases of HIV coming across our borders from the people in Honduras.
[00:24:24.878 --> 00:24:28.922]  So now they have activated their Emergency Operations Center.
[00:24:29.443 --> 00:24:31.545]  But the thing is though, they're being very silent about it.
[00:24:31.565 --> 00:24:34.008]  They're not making it very public that they've done that.
[00:24:34.668 --> 00:24:42.857]  And instead of them doing their job, which is helping inform the doctors, the law enforcement, the Border Patrol, across the border, they're keeping it to themselves.
[00:24:43.197 --> 00:24:51.345]  You know, there's reports right now that in El Paso there is a decontamination center set up right now, much like one that you would find in West Africa.
[00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:58.712]  You know, why aren't they informing the doctors and the border patrol and the police across the border about these diseases?
[00:24:58.772 --> 00:25:00.033]  Why are they keeping them secret?
[00:25:00.354 --> 00:25:02.336]  They know something's up, but they're not telling us.
[00:25:02.776 --> 00:25:09.181]  They have a decontamination center, they have this emergency operation center set up, but they're keeping the public uninformed.
[00:25:09.661 --> 00:25:11.443]  So the question is, is what are they hiding?
[00:25:11.503 --> 00:25:12.303]  What do they know about?
[00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:14.585]  And why aren't they telling the public more about it?
[00:25:15.125 --> 00:25:19.128]  So what you need to do is get on your phone, call the CDC and demand answers like I've done.
[00:25:19.509 --> 00:25:22.531]  Maybe we can figure out what's going on and what's coming across our borders.
[00:25:39.474 --> 00:25:46.116]  Alex Jones here to break down some exciting developments in the area of research concerning supplemental iodine.
[00:25:46.756 --> 00:25:48.917]  It's nothing less than phenomenal.
[00:25:49.477 --> 00:25:55.699]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:25:56.019 --> 00:25:59.982]  And I used some of the mainline iodine supplements and they upset my stomach and I had some issues with it.
[00:26:00.502 --> 00:26:10.769]  Until I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, who I was already interviewing as an expert on my radio show, and I began taking the product before he actually rolled it out.
[00:26:11.229 --> 00:26:16.533]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:26:17.293 --> 00:26:25.098]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:26:26.139 --> 00:26:36.061]  That are incredibly powerful that no one else has as a source for their iodine from between 7 and 12,000 feet literally drilled out of the ground.
[00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:41.702]  You put it on a hot plate and it turns into the pure gas.
[00:26:41.902 --> 00:26:45.143]  No one else has 99.99% pure iodine.
[00:26:46.583 --> 00:26:50.384]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:26:51.004 --> 00:26:52.505]  I was over 270 pounds.
[00:26:54.285 --> 00:27:03.334]  And with the iodine, exercise, and better diet, I have lost now more than 50 pounds total, and I'm continuing to lose the weight.
[00:27:03.694 --> 00:27:07.818]  I have more energy, my libido, all this crap came out of my skin.
[00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:09.840]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.202]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:27:11.502 --> 00:27:12.603]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:27:13.163 --> 00:27:17.927]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:18.248 --> 00:27:19.128]  This is innovating.
[00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:20.549]  This is trailblazing.
[00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:28.276]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:27:28.516 --> 00:27:32.599]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:27:32.779 --> 00:27:37.984]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:27:46.676 --> 00:27:47.257]  Welcome back.
[00:27:47.517 --> 00:27:52.985]  Now, tomorrow is the 4th of July and the anniversary, of course, of the Declaration of Independence.
[00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:58.232]  That was fundamentally about our rights and how government was there to secure those rights.
[00:27:58.292 --> 00:28:02.437]  And so, we always tie the 4th of July together with the Bill of Rights.
[00:28:03.038 --> 00:28:04.639]  The Bill of Rights doesn't give us our rights.
[00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:05.840]  Those come from our Creator.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.303]  They're there to secure those rights, to make sure that government doesn't take them away.
[00:28:11.383 --> 00:28:22.329]  Now, the very first one of our rights enumerated is free speech, the right of the people to peacefully assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:28.233]  We've got a 20-year-old man tonight who has been doing that in New York since September of 2013.
[00:28:30.194 --> 00:28:33.957]  And of course, they had nothing to say about it until just recently.
[00:28:34.377 --> 00:28:44.684]  And as we've seen this happen over and over again, it's the selective enforcement, the censorship of free speech that they don't agree with, and that's exactly what we see in this story.
[00:28:44.744 --> 00:28:48.587]  Joining us now is Danny Martins from New York, Suffolk County.
[00:28:49.248 --> 00:28:50.308]  Thanks for joining us, Danny.
[00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:51.709]  Tell us about your story.
[00:28:51.749 --> 00:28:52.490]  Tell us what happened.
[00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:57.894]  The article, of course, and the video are up on InfoWars.com, but go through it briefly with the audience here.
[00:28:59.023 --> 00:29:02.806]  I have been doing this Impeach Obama protest over the Long Island Expressway.
[00:29:02.886 --> 00:29:04.127]  It was a pedestrian overpass.
[00:29:04.547 --> 00:29:06.608]  I've been doing it since September 2013.
[00:29:06.929 --> 00:29:12.432]  So I've been doing it for almost a year, excluding the winter in New York because it gets cold and snowy.
[00:29:12.513 --> 00:29:13.933]  It's just like, embarrassing to be up there.
[00:29:14.354 --> 00:29:19.978]  But I've been doing it like every week, every Friday, two hours a day for like six or seven months straight.
[00:29:20.638 --> 00:29:21.639]  With no incident.
[00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:28.765]  And then the police came and they said, you know, we have a safety concern that we feel as if you're causing a distraction.
[00:29:29.366 --> 00:29:35.251]  And I said, well, there's billboards, there's politician signs, reelection campaign signs.
[00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:37.753]  You have billboards just directing people on the highway.
[00:29:37.853 --> 00:29:39.514]  So I didn't understand their concern.
[00:29:39.875 --> 00:29:41.996]  And I told them if they were so worried about
[00:29:42.737 --> 00:29:45.640]  The people on the roads concerned, they have two jobs.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.545]  They have the job to worry about public safety and as well protect my rights.
[00:29:49.925 --> 00:29:56.913]  If they were really concerned about the public safety, they could have had an officer sitting with his lights on, slowing down traffic as I peacefully protested.
[00:29:57.433 --> 00:29:57.834]  But uh...
[00:29:58.894 --> 00:30:00.315]  Well, it's not even that, Danny.
[00:30:00.355 --> 00:30:03.458]  I mean, they're just so selective about when they do it.
[00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:08.863]  As you mentioned, you've been doing that since September with a hiatus for the winter.
[00:30:09.524 --> 00:30:16.570]  But it's now July, so they've had at least six months of this stuff, and you're doing it every weekend.
[00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:18.292]  We see this all over the country.
[00:30:18.812 --> 00:30:26.298]  We had a gun store owner who was essentially run out of his position in the mall because they didn't want a gun store in the mall.
[00:30:26.718 --> 00:30:33.704]  When he opened up his new business he had a guy dress up like a banana and put an AK-47 over his shoulder and the police harassed him.
[00:30:34.144 --> 00:30:40.749]  Did it under the pretense that he was a distraction to traffic and yet just down the street they had of course a Liberty Tax
[00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.970]  Oh, yeah.
[00:30:58.679 --> 00:30:59.660]  Opening a gun shop.
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:06.186]  Somehow those people are a distraction to drivers that's deadly, even though we haven't had any incidents where that's happened.
[00:31:06.586 --> 00:31:17.075]  And yet people who are doing exactly the same thing, or all the signs as you pointed out, there's business signs, there's billboards, there's road signs everywhere, and of course people can handle all those signs.
[00:31:17.115 --> 00:31:22.780]  What they can't handle is your particular sign that's essentially exercising your First Amendment rights.
[00:31:23.522 --> 00:31:23.942]  Exactly.
[00:31:24.122 --> 00:31:32.448]  And I believe, for what I've been told, there is one of these kind of protests, impeach Obama protests, held in every state across the nation, at least one.
[00:31:33.028 --> 00:31:40.753]  And throughout the whole nation, thousands of protests, not one person was ever in an accident or ever been injured from this type of protest.
[00:31:40.813 --> 00:31:41.593]  It just never happened.
[00:31:41.713 --> 00:31:42.274]  So they were just
[00:31:42.694 --> 00:31:43.034]  That's right.
[00:31:43.414 --> 00:31:54.398]  We did have a lot of people that were doing it in Missouri that got harassed and several of them got arrested and we sent reporters up there right away because they were going to do it the next weekend and of course the police stood down.
[00:31:54.859 --> 00:32:00.541]  It just goes to show how arbitrary this is and people need to understand how this is expanding.
[00:32:00.981 --> 00:32:03.161]  Because it's not just there.
[00:32:03.481 --> 00:32:11.383]  It's also at places like the Bundy Ranch where they went in and one of the first things the government bureaucrats did there was they created a First Amendment area.
[00:32:11.623 --> 00:32:17.924]  They even had a sign printed up in the middle of nowhere with a fence around it that said, this is a First Amendment area.
[00:32:17.964 --> 00:32:22.185]  Somebody put a handwritten sign up and said, the First Amendment is not an area.
[00:32:22.285 --> 00:32:23.545]  And that's really the key thing.
[00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:26.006]  But they're doing it at political conventions as well.
[00:32:26.046 --> 00:32:27.826]  They've been doing it at presidential conventions.
[00:32:28.126 --> 00:32:47.331]  For the last several presidential, in 12, and it's also in 08, both parties, they take all the people who want to exercise their First Amendment rights to petition about and to address their grievances in public, they send them down the road to a caged-in area and tell them, you have to stay here or we're going to arrest you.
[00:32:48.109 --> 00:32:48.629]  It's ridiculous.
[00:32:48.729 --> 00:32:51.770]  They're completely controlling your rights and where you can do it, how you can do it.
[00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:55.151]  It's absolutely ridiculous and people get afraid.
[00:32:55.331 --> 00:32:59.852]  People are afraid to do these things because they fear the police and I don't know why because you have every right.
[00:33:00.213 --> 00:33:07.995]  And then you have people like me where they're trying to set an example and then now I have to go through the bureaucracy of the system and fight the courts and challenge them.
[00:33:08.922 --> 00:33:13.425]  Well, we all really appreciate you standing up for your rights as well as for our rights.
[00:33:14.045 --> 00:33:16.527]  And you've got a crowdfunding source that's going up there.
[00:33:16.547 --> 00:33:18.748]  If people want to stand with you, tell us about that, how they can help.
[00:33:19.694 --> 00:33:27.820]  Um, you can go search www.gofundme.com forward slash impeach Obama.
[00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:32.404]  So it's www.gofundme.com forward slash impeach Obama.
[00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:34.806]  All donations go to attorney fees.
[00:33:35.526 --> 00:33:37.067]  Um, I really appreciate it.
[00:33:37.087 --> 00:33:41.511]  I'm just a college student and I don't have a large income at all.
[00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:47.195]  And there's a link to that in our article as well, talking about you with the embedded video.
[00:33:47.215 --> 00:33:52.819]  There's several links to other related articles, as well as one to your GoFundMe account.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.782]  So, at this point, they've charged you with what?
[00:33:56.582 --> 00:33:59.945]  Disorderly conduct was originally what they charged me with, and that's what you hear on the video.
[00:34:00.345 --> 00:34:04.868]  Later, at the precinct, they added on criminal nuisance, which is a Class D misdemeanor in New York State.
[00:34:06.542 --> 00:34:08.243]  So they said I was being a nuisance.
[00:34:08.703 --> 00:34:11.884]  And from what my lawyer said, this is what a nuisance is.
[00:34:11.924 --> 00:34:18.846]  A nuisance is, this is a good example, you're throwing bricks at a person, but you're not hitting them, you're throwing it near them.
[00:34:19.066 --> 00:34:20.026]  Is that anything what you did?
[00:34:20.306 --> 00:34:21.506]  Is it anything like what I did?
[00:34:21.646 --> 00:34:22.247]  No, it's not.
[00:34:22.267 --> 00:34:29.829]  It's completely irrelevant, unrelated, and it was just a BS charge for people, for them to prosecute me if they want to stop me.
[00:34:30.009 --> 00:34:33.490]  I thought it was interesting in your video, you were telling the police officer that you've had
[00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:38.771]  Other officers come up in uniform and give you Snickers and Coke and that sort of thing.
[00:34:38.811 --> 00:34:40.311]  So this is not a universal thing.
[00:34:40.551 --> 00:34:50.714]  This is the arbitrary, capricious exercise of the law with false charges that they're now building up in order to try, I guess, to get you to plea bargain down to something lesser.
[00:34:51.214 --> 00:34:51.574]  Exactly.
[00:34:51.614 --> 00:34:54.654]  And I'm not accepting a plea because if I accept a plea, I'm pleading guilty.
[00:34:55.255 --> 00:34:57.375]  And I'm not willing to do that because I'm not guilty.
[00:34:57.415 --> 00:34:58.955]  I was well on my rights and I'm going to fight it.
[00:34:59.035 --> 00:35:01.136]  And if I have to go to trial, I'll go to trial.
[00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:01.921]  Good.
[00:35:02.061 --> 00:35:04.964]  And if you have to go to trial, do a fully informed jury.
[00:35:05.745 --> 00:35:08.027]  You need to get involved with the fully informed jury people.
[00:35:08.047 --> 00:35:10.289]  They need to start educating jurors in that area.
[00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:13.212]  Not just for your case, but for all the different cases.
[00:35:13.312 --> 00:35:19.337]  And if they do it for a specific case, then they try to come after the people who are handing out stuff and saying it's jury tampering.
[00:35:19.577 --> 00:35:21.900]  They need to be educating people for all the cases.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.202]  We need to stand up for our rights in every
[00:35:24.882 --> 00:35:27.743]  Every possible way, and I really appreciate you doing this.
[00:35:27.803 --> 00:35:33.085]  So many people are just happy to do nothing except get drunk on the 4th of July.
[00:35:33.446 --> 00:35:36.267]  You're exercising your rights, and here we are the day before.
[00:35:36.887 --> 00:35:40.168]  You're facing criminal charges because of that, but you're not going to back down.
[00:35:40.228 --> 00:35:41.249]  I really appreciate that.
[00:35:41.689 --> 00:35:45.690]  I really appreciate what you guys have been doing, and I've been listening to you guys since I was in 8th grade, so I was around 14.
[00:35:45.851 --> 00:35:51.133]  It's like 06, and you guys have just been growing and growing and getting bigger and bigger, and it's only going to get bigger.
[00:35:51.173 --> 00:35:51.813]  It's a snowball.
[00:35:52.281 --> 00:35:53.522]  Well, thank you so much, Danny.
[00:35:53.622 --> 00:35:58.827]  I really appreciate it, but it's really people who get interested in this and actually do something about it.
[00:35:59.107 --> 00:36:00.909]  And you've got to stand firm about this.
[00:36:00.969 --> 00:36:03.091]  If you don't use your rights, you're going to lose them.
[00:36:03.131 --> 00:36:06.634]  That's why we're losing our rights, is because people are so apathetic about it.
[00:36:07.675 --> 00:36:15.618]  If they cared anything at all about it, to do not even as much as you're doing, but just to stand up to the police and write letters and say, this is abusive.
[00:36:15.638 --> 00:36:22.840]  You know, and we see so many ways, not just in this, but in so many ways where the police are abusing people's rights and nothing is ever done about it.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.261]  Thank you so much for doing this.
[00:36:24.301 --> 00:36:29.002]  We're going to follow this story, keep us informed as to what's going on and best of luck with this trial.
[00:36:29.203 --> 00:36:29.723]  I hope you win.
[00:36:30.263 --> 00:36:32.104]  Thank you so much and I really appreciate it.
[00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:32.804]  Thank you.
[00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:33.224]  Bye bye.
[00:36:33.886 --> 00:36:38.189]  Of course, as I mentioned in the interview, this is being done selectively in a number of different places.
[00:36:38.649 --> 00:36:42.371]  Houston did it against a gun store owner, but not against other stores.
[00:36:42.891 --> 00:36:48.534]  We've seen this same type of protest on overpasses shut down violently in Missouri.
[00:36:49.095 --> 00:36:57.500]  Dallas is another example of this, and we had one of the city councilors there who voted against an ordinance that's set up to selectively shut down
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.001]  I think.
[00:37:16.124 --> 00:37:16.524]  I think.
[00:37:36.272 --> 00:37:55.100]  Familiar instances the George W. Bush library that opened up there and of course the people who are protesting that we're not close to a highway and also the Alex Jones protests with the InfoWars crew where they were protesting the gag on free speech on protests about the official story at the 50th anniversary of the assassination of JFK.
[00:37:55.341 --> 00:38:02.824]  In both of those cases they use these ordinances when there was no threat to traffic just a threat to the official narrative.
[00:38:03.396 --> 00:38:04.377]  Well, that's it for tonight.
[00:38:04.918 --> 00:38:08.541]  Join us on Prison Planet TV tomorrow night for a special edition of the Nightly News.
[00:38:08.561 --> 00:38:13.506]  We have a roundtable format that is pre-recorded, but it is new, original material.
[00:38:13.986 --> 00:38:17.229]  So that'll be tomorrow night at the usual time, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[00:38:17.389 --> 00:38:17.690]  Eastern.
[00:38:29.272 --> 00:38:35.774]  A child in Arizona now has sexual misconduct on his permanent record for dropping his pants on the playground.
[00:38:36.354 --> 00:38:42.576]  The five-year-old was ushered into the assistant principal's office where he signed a statement without his parents present.
[00:38:42.856 --> 00:38:46.977]  No one explained to the boy that he could have asked for the counsel of his mother.
[00:38:47.757 --> 00:38:53.580]  In Oklahoma, a three-year-old was fined over $2,000 for urinating in his own yard.
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:39:00.743]  Obviously, the boy's mother was upset, and after much public outcry, the charge was dropped and the officer fired.
[00:39:01.283 --> 00:39:05.625]  Both of the previous examples are completely harmless, childish behavior.
[00:39:05.825 --> 00:39:12.728]  But why should these children be punished for supposed sexual or deviant behavior when that's what they're being taught in school?
[00:39:13.368 --> 00:39:18.473]  We've seen reports that the United Nations is supportive of teaching five-year-olds to masturbate.
[00:39:18.873 --> 00:39:19.434]  The U.N.
[00:39:19.494 --> 00:39:21.916]  claims their curriculum is age-appropriate.
[00:39:22.557 --> 00:39:23.978]  Possibly following the U.N.'
[00:39:23.958 --> 00:39:28.022]  's lead, the city of Chicago is eager to teach their children about sex.
[00:39:28.422 --> 00:39:33.346]  CPS insists their teachings meet the National Sexuality Education Standards.
[00:39:34.027 --> 00:39:35.288]  I ran against Alan Keyes.
[00:39:35.308 --> 00:39:36.609]  I don't know if you guys remember Alan Keyes.
[00:39:37.688 --> 00:39:49.574]  But I remember him using this in his campaign against me, saying, Barack Obama supports teaching sex education to kindergartners.
[00:39:51.075 --> 00:39:55.097]  And, you know, which I didn't know what to tell him.
[00:40:01.193 --> 00:40:02.154]  But it's the right thing to do.
[00:40:02.874 --> 00:40:11.238]  It should be stressed that if some guy in a park showed a child a picture of a penis, even an animated one, he'd likely go to jail.
[00:40:11.638 --> 00:40:17.701]  But if the child is exposed to such material in school, even without the parent's consent, that's considered fine.
[00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:20.802]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com
