[00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:18.355]  The video of a homeless man shot to death after illegally camping in Albuquerque looks to many people like cold-blooded murder by the police.
[00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:22.397]  But the Albuquerque police chief has pronounced the shooting as justified.
[00:00:22.657 --> 00:00:31.021]  Members of the local press complained the police chief cut the press conference off abruptly before they were able to ask questions about the use of lethal force.
[00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:40.783]  Like many police departments across the country, APD's excessive use of force is escalating because the police aren't brought to justice when they cross the line.
[00:00:41.143 --> 00:00:54.227]  Look at how differently the police who are involved in shootings are treated compared to a New Mexico sheriff who pushed back against TSA harassment and was threatened while traveling to a Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association meeting.
[00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:59.509]  Shane Harger was fired and his entire small town police force was disbanded.
[00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:07.412]  The mainstream media joined with the TSA and a sheriff's department to imply that there was something fishy about him having two IDs.
[00:01:07.832 --> 00:01:14.014]  But the reason he had two IDs goes back to a murder trial involving an Albuquerque police officer.
[00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:18.536]  Levi Chavez was a cop who said his wife committed suicide using his service revolver.
[00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:21.277]  Shane Harger was a deputy and first on the scene.
[00:01:21.817 --> 00:01:24.958]  According to the deposition, Deputy Shane Harger said he was appalled when he was told by an APD lieutenant
[00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:42.596]  He was going to cut up and remove bloody sheets.
[00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:55.686]  Harger said in the deposition, quote, I was appalled that a lieutenant of a renowned agency as Albuquerque Police Department would even consider entering a homicide scene out of his jurisdiction, let alone remove evidence.
[00:01:56.286 --> 00:02:07.076]  So Lieutenant, who should know better, and who's out of his jurisdiction, calls and gets permission to destroy evidence, and it just so happens that the suspect is a friend and fellow cop?
[00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:10.319]  The suspect's uncle, Robert Chavez, was a sheriff.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.723]  Shane Harger was offered a job and accepted, not knowing that they were related.
[00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:25.002]  The murder suspect's father, Levi Chavez Sr., also worked for Robert Chavez and allegedly approached Shane Harger to give favorable testimony about his son.
[00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:44.737]  When you look at what came to light during the investigation, the destroyed evidence, the alleged car theft ring being run by the Chavez law enforcement family, and the multiple suicides of people involved with the Chavez family cops that were killed with police service revolvers belonging to the Chavez family members,
[00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:48.379]  It appears that Shane Harger had very good reason to fear for his life.
[00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.180]  And that's something that's apparently a big problem in New Mexico.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.400]  Just look at these recent headlines from just the last three months.
[00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.181]  A cop shooting up a minivan full of kids.
[00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:00.182]  A man doesn't come to a complete stop.
[00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:05.143]  And the cops force him to undergo enemas, x-rays, and eight anal probes.
[00:03:06.178 --> 00:03:09.161]  A woman has her genitals sprayed with mace by a cop.
[00:03:09.782 --> 00:03:18.472]  You would think that New Mexico would be applauding that someone in law enforcement was concerned about the police staying within the bounds of the law and the Constitution.
[00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:26.281]  The media and law enforcement routinely excuse the behavior of cops who abuse citizens, even kill them, if they merely feel threatened.
[00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:34.604]  But if a cop like Chief Harger gets death threats because he's testifying against another cop, he's somehow bad if he legally gets another name to protect himself?
[00:03:35.044 --> 00:03:38.085]  Officers are rarely brought to trial, even more rarely convicted.
[00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:43.147]  Although the city is paying a fortune in lawsuits for excessive use of force.
[00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:45.767]  24 million dollars since 2010 and counting.
[00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:53.490]  The Albuquerque Police Force has shot 36 people, 23 of them fatally, since 2010.
[00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.732]  They've had officers shoot more people than the New York Police Department, even though New York is 16 times larger.
[00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:04.814]  In fact, the Albuquerque Police are four times more likely to shoot than the national average.
[00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:15.998]  An ongoing Department of Justice probe seeks to, quote, determine whether APD engages in a pattern or practice of use of excessive force in violation of the Constitution and federal law.
[00:04:16.598 --> 00:04:29.503]  If the Department of Justice is serious about finding out why APD is so quick to shoot the public, it should start with the militarization and the no-hesitation mindset being pushed by Homeland Security and the federal government.
[00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:36.948]  New Mexico's new Shoot First training program is so bad that at least one instructor refused to even teach it.
[00:04:37.549 --> 00:04:38.830]  So, he was fired.
[00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.255]  And the public has been shut out of policy decisions even as taxpayers are forced to pay for lawsuits against the police.
[00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:54.462]  Jack Jones, director of New Mexico's Law Enforcement Academy, justified the Shoot First training by saying, I would rephrase that.
[00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.591]  The state of New Mexico has come to evil.
[00:05:10.234 --> 00:05:15.857]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:05:16.037 --> 00:05:23.280]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.621]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:28.544]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:05:28.784 --> 00:05:33.371]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
