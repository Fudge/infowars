[00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:19.398]  I heard some gunshots over there.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.905]  I hope you guys heard that.
[00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.148]  There was multiple gunshots there.
[00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:27.410]  At least four or five.
[00:00:30.054 --> 00:00:32.818]  But it wasn't near us, so we're okay for the moment.
[00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.888]  I don't know what that means.
[00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.190]  Hit him some more.
[00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.752]  Hit him some more.
[00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:43.014]  You know what them thumpers mean don't you?
[00:00:43.034 --> 00:00:43.895]  You understand that?
[00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:45.657]  Yeah, it means I'm about to get out here in the street.
[00:00:46.238 --> 00:00:47.178]  Run out there next.
[00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.601]  I bet you won't run out there next.
[00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:57.563]  Stop throwing objects at law enforcement.
[00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:00.664]  Do it now or you will be subject to arrest.
[00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:07.226]  Disperse immediately and stop throwing objects at law enforcement.
[00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:08.487]  Do it now.
[00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:11.107]  You need to disperse immediately.
[00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:20.670]  If you are in the middle of the street, you are lawfully assembled, you will be subject to arrest.
[00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.831]  Do it now.
[00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:31.416]  I'm trying to get my gas mask on if you don't mind.
[00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:21.346]  Yeah, I don't feel like getting shot at.
[00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:48.378]  So I just heard my third string of gunfire for the night sounded like four or five shots I heard about five six earlier than a single shot.
[00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:54.142]  So that's the third round that I've heard I don't believe they are fired by the police.
[00:03:54.182 --> 00:03:54.843]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:56.864]  The police are firing tear gas.
[00:03:57.345 --> 00:04:00.727]  I see guys with rubber bullets I don't know if they've shot anybody with those as of yet.
[00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:01.928]  We're in front of the
[00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.390]  Firehouse, I'm back up here to show you guys this broken window.
[00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.831]  This is the window that got busted immediately after the Darren Wilson verdict was announced here to the crowd.
[00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:15.072]  So far we have word that there's looting going on.
[00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:17.173]  Right now we're on South Florissant Avenue.
[00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:25.375]  Also, people are running up the road away from the police now, but people have started mobilizing, getting in their cars and moving to different areas.
[00:04:29.804 --> 00:04:30.745]  Hey, that's the car that's on fire!
[00:04:58.822 --> 00:05:01.184]  This thing has been ran through.
[00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:15.695]  It's like August all over here.
[00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:19.558]  There's a huge plume of smoke.
[00:05:19.578 --> 00:05:22.641]  But once it's not tear gas, it's actually smoke.
[00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:07.982]  Yeah, uh, police officer.
[00:06:08.042 --> 00:06:09.046]  He's sitting there.
[00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.911]  We're good to go.
[00:07:13.604 --> 00:07:14.305]  It is wild.
[00:07:15.346 --> 00:07:16.306]  Buildings have been looted.
[00:07:16.326 --> 00:07:22.611]  I personally have witnessed a McDonald's or seen the aftermath of a McDonald's and also a Boost Mobile store.
[00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:25.594]  I went in the Boost Mobile store a little bit earlier in the stream.
[00:07:29.137 --> 00:07:34.661]  It's even hard to breathe because out in front of the police station we were dealing with tear gas.
[00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:36.042]  Now we're dealing with smoke.
[00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:41.006]  And all the stuff that goes along with that.
[00:07:41.046 --> 00:07:42.928]  There's the officers in the MRAP.
[00:07:45.606 --> 00:07:46.788]  You think I can cross the street?
[00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.413]  Uh, think you want to cross the street?
[00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:51.516]  Okay, yeah.
[00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:52.618]  Go ahead, man.
[00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:53.480]  Rock on.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:53.820]  Be safe.
[00:08:09.073 --> 00:08:12.315]  And we took our boards down to try to trust in the community.
[00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:14.776]  She said she took the boards down to try to trust in the people.
[00:08:14.796 --> 00:08:16.337]  You ain't gonna be able to park down there.
[00:08:16.517 --> 00:08:17.797]  I came up with that.
[00:08:17.837 --> 00:08:23.100]  And as you can see, the firefighters had to pull out of here because they were having people shooting at them.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.021]  They even left the fire hoses.
[00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:25.981]  That's how quick they left.
[00:08:38.777 --> 00:08:39.678]  Is this your store, sir?
[00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:40.099]  Yeah.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:40.720]  Yeah.
[00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:41.962]  You gotta do it.
[00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:47.149]  Yeah, you know, I don't know.
[00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:47.530]  I don't know.
[00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.812]  Sorry, guys.
[00:08:48.832 --> 00:08:49.633]  You ready, man.
[00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:49.933]  Watch out.
[00:08:49.953 --> 00:08:50.274]  Watch out.
[00:08:50.294 --> 00:08:50.594]  You ready.
[00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:50.935]  You ready.
[00:08:51.816 --> 00:08:52.737]  See, Youngstown, they burning up.
[00:08:52.797 --> 00:08:53.579]  Every store in this town.
[00:09:00.111 --> 00:09:10.940]  I don't know if you guys just heard that the radio dispatch said that somebody's riding up and down the street shooting a rifle outside of a car.
[00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:13.302]  Wild stuff.
[00:09:28.493 --> 00:09:29.234]  They are going to
[00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:34.095]  Ramp up and then tomorrow's just going to be an all out.
[00:09:34.776 --> 00:09:36.739]  You know, today was just like a burning of the town.
[00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:37.901]  I mean, look at the distance, man.
[00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:39.022]  Everything is on fire.
[00:09:39.663 --> 00:09:40.604]  Look at that shot, man.
[00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:47.614]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:09:47.634 --> 00:09:48.014]  This is the
[00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:58.487]  The hours after the announcement that Darren Wilson was not going to be indicted, as you can see, buildings on West Florissant are just up in flames.
[00:09:58.507 --> 00:10:04.252]  There have been shots all night, just people shooting off guns from the crowd.
[00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:09.356]  I mean, from where I am right now, I can feel the heat coming from that building as it burns to the ground.
[00:10:09.716 --> 00:10:11.437]  This has been a crazy night.
[00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:12.638]  This far surpasses
[00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:15.880]  The chaos that happened in August.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.602]  I mean, we've been hearing it in chants and stuff.
[00:10:19.622 --> 00:10:20.882]  We're going to burn this place down.
[00:10:20.922 --> 00:10:23.763]  But God Almighty, I never thought it was going to happen.
[00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.965]  We're going to come back tomorrow and check it out so you can see the
[00:10:28.123 --> 00:10:30.925]  You know, the severity of the damage and what's been happening.
[00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:33.226]  You know, the National Guard is here.
[00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:34.727]  There's a bunch of Humvees over this way.
[00:10:34.787 --> 00:10:38.170]  I've seen almost a thousand police officers on the ground.
[00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.892]  And we saw a large force in front of the police department earlier.
[00:10:42.192 --> 00:10:51.838]  But now, for some reason, in this area where, you know, it's hit the fan completely, it's... the police force was much less in this area.
[00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:54.040]  And, uh...
[00:10:55.265 --> 00:10:57.607]  Overall this has just been a crazy experience man.
[00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:01.049]  So continue watching our report on Joe Biggs with Infowars.com
