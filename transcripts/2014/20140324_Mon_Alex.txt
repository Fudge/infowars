[00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:04.618]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:08.606]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:19.078]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:20.540]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.241]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:26.464]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:31.128]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:56.118]  Start your engines, ladies and gentlemen, for another massive assault against tyranny and the lies that uphold this global structure that underpin this planetary tyranny.
[00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.761]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is already Monday, the 24th day of March 2014.
[00:01:03.524 --> 00:01:10.806]  Hard to believe we're about to plunge another month into 2014, and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.086]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:20.388]  No guests today, because I want to cover news, get to special reports, take your phone calls, and just get into a ton of issues.
[00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:21.608]  Where to begin?
[00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:25.629]  Well, Paul Watson wrote about it this morning at Infowars.com.
[00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:29.192]  And it's very important.
[00:01:29.212 --> 00:01:31.935]  The London Telegraph also is reporting on it.
[00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:33.997]  That's the top story at DrugsReport.com.
[00:01:34.037 --> 00:01:34.597]  It should be.
[00:01:35.058 --> 00:01:39.322]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:44.466]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:48.670]  I need to have Darren McBrain, who makes a lot of these great video intros for the show.
[00:01:49.631 --> 00:02:01.235]  Slash audio intros, do one with Soylent Green, with lines from the movie, and then cut it into all the newscasts saying, kids are bad for the planet, we need to use corpses as fertilizer.
[00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:12.519]  Just to illustrate the dehumanization, the lowering of value of human life, of the case for killing granny, or we want death panels, or government run euthanasia.
[00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.161]  Cutting it in with Soylent Green that came out, what, in the early 1970s.
[00:02:18.148 --> 00:02:19.469]  So we're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.073]  Aborted babies incinerated at UK hospitals and then a really important group of articles.
[00:02:25.043 --> 00:02:30.186]  London Telegraph, London Financial Times of London, AFP, you name it.
[00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:35.529]  The strange revival of Republican America.
[00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:40.952]  Now, we're going to explain what this really is coming up, and why it's one of our last chances.
[00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:46.034]  And the globalists know that, so they're all in to suppress the Tea Party taking it over.
[00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:50.057]  And that dovetails with AFP, French far right,
[00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:54.516]  Triumphs in local polls that hammer ruling socialists.
[00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:58.998]  So we're going to be tying those articles together with this one.
[00:02:59.398 --> 00:03:06.242]  Feminist professor who attacked pro-life student charged with criminal battery after mainstream media refused to cover it.
[00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:10.785]  Real media, not alternative media, covered it and now the police have been forced to act.
[00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:18.049]  And there's more calls today for arresting anyone that doesn't want to pay carbon taxes to Al Gore by the, quote, liberals.
[00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:27.677]  Who are flaming, dumb, lazy, fascist, greedy, grasping, evil control freaks who control the Republican Party leadership.
[00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:30.600]  You wonder why we can't beat these sacks of garbage?
[00:03:31.581 --> 00:03:35.604]  They got a lot of well-meaning liberals that believe in them and go along with them who we have to wake up.
[00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:43.672]  And they've got a lot of well-meaning conservatives that support neocons that put out decent rhetoric sometimes but don't follow it.
[00:03:44.668 --> 00:03:46.450]  And we're conquered by the globalists, folks.
[00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.155]  They're going to gut this country and make us financially destitute to control us on record if we don't stop them.
[00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:56.438]  They've already done a pretty darn good job of it, but they're going to go all the way.
[00:03:57.118 --> 00:03:58.860]  This is a scorched-earth economic policy.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.560]  We've got to stop them.
[00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:03.964]  Speaking of carbon taxes, Al Gore, you know, to save the Earth.
[00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:10.069]  Arctic cold returning to Midwest and the East despite spring coming four days ago.
[00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:25.400]  And we're going to tie also that in to this incredible report from Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that if we broke this six years ago, it would be national news.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.981]  We cannot let this become passe.
[00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:38.605]  Another document we got leaked to us from Oath Keepers, we've confirmed the authenticity of the PDF, where they're training to take on free Americans against socialist tyranny.
[00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:39.465]  That's an actual quote.
[00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:43.867]  Who are against, quote, martial law, so Homeland Security's main mission.
[00:04:44.768 --> 00:04:45.568]  Take on who?
[00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.269]  Veterans!
[00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:49.030]  Next, gun owners!
[00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.771]  Next, libertarians!
[00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:52.271]  Next, Christians!
[00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:55.293]  Then, mainline conservatives, constitutionalists.
[00:04:56.293 --> 00:05:02.616]  Because the enemy knows we're the people that are awake, and have the answers, and if our word gets out, the globalists are all going to prison!
[00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:05.417]  I mean, they're engaged in total criminal activity!
[00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:06.898]  We'll be right back, stay with us!
[00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.733]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:17.861]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:25.233]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:05:25.353 --> 00:05:30.756]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:34.618]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:39.520]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.943]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:05:45.203 --> 00:05:48.266]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:05:48.427 --> 00:05:50.669]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.514]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:05:55.694 --> 00:05:58.157]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:05:58.597 --> 00:06:05.585]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.

[00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:09.527]  Infowarsshop.com.

[00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.812]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:06:19.973 --> 00:06:20.853]  You have a system that

[00:06:49.252 --> 00:07:00.522]  Herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:14.117]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:07:14.257 --> 00:07:17.241]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:07:17.382 --> 00:07:22.610]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.533]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:07:24.853 --> 00:07:26.193]  We are what we eat.
[00:07:26.493 --> 00:07:30.855]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:07:31.175 --> 00:07:35.136]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:07:35.396 --> 00:07:37.717]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:07:37.937 --> 00:07:43.878]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[00:07:44.178 --> 00:07:46.419]  To learn more visit InfoWarsHealth.com

[00:08:22.827 --> 00:08:31.491]  It is only fitting that a free scream should sound the alarm against those who would destroy freedom.
[00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:40.414]  For in its power to deceive and inflame, or enlighten and inspire, the motion picture has no equal.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.961]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:54.582]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:55.162 --> 00:09:00.383]  It is the 24th day of March 2014 on this Monday edition.
[00:09:01.163 --> 00:09:10.945]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours and are going to have open phones, premiere a bunch of special reports, and get into a host of huge breaking news stories.
[00:09:11.766 --> 00:09:12.966]  But first off, have you heard?
[00:09:13.726 --> 00:09:24.796]  First they promised everybody free health care, then they promised everybody reduced price health care, then they promised everybody that you could keep your doctor, and now they promised death panels and no health care and quadrupling of the prices.
[00:09:25.476 --> 00:09:34.664]  And they're using bossy women in TV ads telling their teenage and twenty-something children they better get Obamacare.
[00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:37.226]  And you're a real woman, you're a real feminist.
[00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:41.112]  Why, your husband died of a heart attack early from your hen pecking.
[00:09:41.472 --> 00:09:43.936]  You worship Michelle Obama and the snapping turtle.
[00:09:44.337 --> 00:09:45.118]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:45.699 --> 00:09:49.724]  Then make your family sign on to the government slave wagon now.
[00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:52.502]  Well, that's been failing.
[00:09:53.382 --> 00:10:08.368]  So they've got LeBron James and a whole string of Hollywood Froot Loops out there pushing the fraud that it's so trendy to go sign up for the IRS to garnish your wages at healthcare.gangrape.
[00:10:08.568 --> 00:10:09.989]  I mean, excuse me, healthcare.gov.
[00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:14.691]  But now, ladies and gentlemen, the secret weapon.
[00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:19.993]  They are using cute Persian cats to sell it.
[00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:26.049]  And again, this just shows the absolute boil down of who they're targeting.
[00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:28.711]  The most trendy, mindless people.
[00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:48.047]  I run into these trendies and they literally are super ultra soft, super ultra passive, they love being abused, they trust the system implicitly, and they dislike anyone who's manly, anyone who's truly feminine, and they're just absolute fourth, fifth generation jellyfish.
[00:10:49.873 --> 00:10:54.236]  And so now they've got stuff with ducks, dancing, saying I'm so excited.
[00:10:54.356 --> 00:10:55.277]  They're saying you're animals.
[00:10:55.757 --> 00:10:56.878]  They talk to you like you're a two-year-old.
[00:10:57.098 --> 00:11:00.420]  This is how you would lure a child into a van to take them for snuff films.
[00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:04.403]  It's with ducks, with geese, and with kitty cats.
[00:11:05.304 --> 00:11:06.684]  And with funny videos, with clowns.
[00:11:07.765 --> 00:11:10.407]  I mean, these people are absolute psycho criminals.
[00:11:11.488 --> 00:11:13.049]  And you can see who their targets are.
[00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:16.051]  Arrested development, childlike brains.
[00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:21.572]  Cats that are asleep, getting their paws rubbed.
[00:11:22.913 --> 00:11:26.114]  Money burning, and I guess that's kind of truth in advertising, gonna burn your money.
[00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:30.135]  A nice pedo bear with a small child.
[00:11:30.675 --> 00:11:32.276]  They actually used pedo bear to promote it.
[00:11:33.156 --> 00:11:46.341]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, panda bears, we're actually showing, for TV viewers, you're already a listener, I'm actually showing what healthcare.gov, through Facebook, is asking their victims to share.
[00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:49.380]  Of course, that's pretty common.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:59.967]  A lot of times, child abductors use other children to actually lure other children with toys and things, like Tickle Me Elmo, which of course, the Elmo, voice of Elmo, we know about him.
[00:12:00.027 --> 00:12:01.108]  He'd fit in well in this crowd.
[00:12:01.748 --> 00:12:04.230]  So, this is par for the course, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:08.893]  Victimizing the arrested development childlike brains of these people.
[00:12:11.335 --> 00:12:17.820]  So, now, there is the headline, Washington Times, White House turns to cat pitchers to sell Obamacare.
[00:12:19.124 --> 00:12:20.624]  Well, it's beyond that.
[00:12:23.225 --> 00:12:31.228]  We read the bill and said it's got death panels, it's got increasing prices massively, doubling on average, quadrupling within five years.
[00:12:31.608 --> 00:12:35.709]  It's written to get rid of pre-existing conditions, to not cover children.
[00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:41.251]  It's written absolutely as a present to the offshore banks and on the insurance companies.
[00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:43.452]  MSNBC said I was racist.
[00:12:43.472 --> 00:12:46.353]  They said, Jones doesn't like Obamacare, he's deeply racist.
[00:12:48.646 --> 00:12:53.871]  They should have just shown, I don't know, like a clown or something and said, this is a mean man who talks serious.
[00:12:55.572 --> 00:12:59.415]  And then they just pull out maybe a puppet and say, we have a puppet, children.
[00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:03.078]  The children would say, we like the puppet.
[00:13:03.118 --> 00:13:06.862]  We should shoot a promo video where we cast somebody that looks like a perv.
[00:13:08.263 --> 00:13:15.769]  And then drive around in a white van with an ice cream truck song playing, going, it's for the children, Obamacare.
[00:13:17.033 --> 00:13:22.756]  And literally have some creepy guys in overalls out front the car going, ah, free candy.
[00:13:23.456 --> 00:13:28.798]  And I bet the mothers will bring their kids up and try to put them in the van with us if we say it's for Obama.
[00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:37.843]  We can like pull a wood chipper behind the ice cream truck, the pervmobile, and tell the mothers, we're going to throw your children in to save the earth.
[00:13:38.303 --> 00:13:40.384]  And if you think I'm joking about this,
[00:13:41.597 --> 00:13:57.668]  They teach, Gloria Steinem does, in promo videos, we've played them, and promo memes that Facebook puts out, that I had an abortion, and I prove I'm a feminist, and you're proud of the abortion, and you wear little coat hangers around your neck to celebrate the abortion.
[00:13:58.718 --> 00:14:02.440]  And they've got this whole dehumanization of, go ahead and get rid of your old folks.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.020]  They're gross.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.681]  They smell.
[00:14:04.141 --> 00:14:05.041]  Old people smell.
[00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:08.863]  That's a trendy meme and comedy to make fun of old people and say, kill your parents.
[00:14:10.304 --> 00:14:11.645]  And you know, life's not worth anything.
[00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:12.425]  Oh, it's so trendy.
[00:14:12.445 --> 00:14:23.011]  Doug Stanhope, who I know well, has been a friend for a long time, who's gone off the deep end, in my view, with just giving into the, you know, to being bummed out and on humanity collapsing.
[00:14:24.412 --> 00:14:26.633]  So continuing, aborted babies.
[00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:33.731]  In this whole line of news, aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals, London Telegraph.
[00:14:34.212 --> 00:14:37.432]  We have an article on Infowars.com giving some more of the back story on it.
[00:14:38.053 --> 00:14:41.434]  Drudge has the big story linked as his top story.
[00:14:41.494 --> 00:14:43.574]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat hospitals.
[00:14:46.175 --> 00:14:48.275]  And it continues, the remains of more than 15,000 babies.
[00:14:50.438 --> 00:14:51.639]  Well that's politically incorrect.
[00:14:51.679 --> 00:14:53.179]  It's like the word bossy needs to be banned.
[00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:57.301]  That might hurt a child sacrificer's ego.
[00:14:57.361 --> 00:15:01.624]  So let's call it the remains of more than 15,000 parasites.
[00:15:02.104 --> 00:15:04.285]  Because that's what feminists teach is a baby's a parasite.
[00:15:05.356 --> 00:15:10.317]  The remains of more than 15,000 scumbag, terrorist, racist, parasite, pieces of filth.
[00:15:10.817 --> 00:15:13.978]  Because we're already killing them, and then incinerating them to heat the hospital.
[00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:15.738]  Soylent greens made out of people.
[00:15:15.758 --> 00:15:18.619]  And we're already using humans for fertilizer all over the world.
[00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:19.699]  That's being pushed as trendy.
[00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:23.520]  And by law, making you be turned into fertilizer, not buried for the earth.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:29.081]  So why not just, let's read this like an anti-human eugenicist would, posing as a trendy.
[00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:39.834]  Aborted blobs of lifeless non-human flesh incinerated to heat glorious UK eugenics facilities.
[00:15:40.495 --> 00:15:52.703]  The remains of more than 15,000 terrorist, racist, scumbag parasites were incinerated as clinical waste by hospitals in Britain with some use in waste-to-energy plants.
[00:15:54.423 --> 00:15:59.926]  New glorious system moves forward as humanity is prepared to be reduced to save the earth.
[00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:03.868]  All hail the robotic revolution and the merger of the transhumanist state.
[00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.269]  There, I just translated that headline for you.
[00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:13.032]  Now, let's read it from the perspective of a human that understands that if the babies have no rights, we have no rights.
[00:16:13.052 --> 00:16:19.855]  And it's part of a giant dehumanization, ultra-Hitlerian, proto-eugenics, eugenics takeover.
[00:16:20.576 --> 00:16:21.376]  Now, let's get into it.
[00:16:23.163 --> 00:16:27.566]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals, London Telegraph.
[00:16:27.906 --> 00:16:34.671]  The remains of more than 1,500 dear little wonderful souls that had incredible futures ahead of them.
[00:16:34.691 --> 00:16:39.615]  15,000, excuse me, I'm having Freudian slips here and trying to reduce the number in my mind.
[00:16:39.635 --> 00:16:40.075]  I said 15, said 1,500, right?
[00:16:43.499 --> 00:16:44.961]  Let me actually just read the headline here.
[00:16:45.541 --> 00:16:49.465]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[00:16:50.206 --> 00:17:00.997]  An act of total dehumanization to lower the value of human life to below zero, ahead of the giant forced mass culling the globalists are planning with the super germs they're releasing and cultivating.
[00:17:01.037 --> 00:17:03.040]  There, another insightful true headline.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.903]  No, no, this time I'm actually just going to read the article and then analyze it after.
[00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:10.512]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[00:17:10.852 --> 00:17:23.161]  The remains of more than 15,000 babies were incinerated as quote clinical waste by hospitals in Britain with some used in waste energy plants.
[00:17:26.603 --> 00:17:31.127]  Continuing, the bodies of thousands of aborted and miscarried babies
[00:17:32.245 --> 00:17:37.413]  Or incinerated as clinical waste, which some even use to heat hospitals, an investigation has found.
[00:17:38.294 --> 00:17:43.401]  Ten NHS trusts have admitted, that's Downing Street Trust, burning
[00:17:44.594 --> 00:17:53.258]  Fetal remains alongside with rubbish, while two others use the bodies in wasted energy plants, which generated power for heat.
[00:17:53.878 --> 00:18:01.801]  Last night, the Department of Health issued an infant ban on the practice which health minister Dr. Dan Poulter branded totally unacceptable.
[00:18:02.202 --> 00:18:02.382]  Why?
[00:18:02.402 --> 00:18:07.024]  Because they're not being sold to French cosmetic makers like the Chinese dead babies are?
[00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:09.645]  So they can be festooned onto women's beaks?
[00:18:10.896 --> 00:18:20.663]  Last night the Department of Health issued an infant man, an instant man, on the practice which Health Minister Dan Poulter branded totally unacceptable.
[00:18:22.264 --> 00:18:28.989]  At least 15,500 fetal remains were incinerated by the 27 NHS Trust over the last two years alone.
[00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:31.211]  Channel 4's dispatch has discovered.
[00:18:31.551 --> 00:18:38.196]  The program, which will air tonight, found that parents who lose children early pregnancy were often treated
[00:18:42.305 --> 00:18:43.846]  Pull the staple out of this so I can read it.
[00:18:44.227 --> 00:18:48.630]  Without compassion and were not consulted about what they wanted to happen to the remains.
[00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:53.134]  Well, they take your blood worldwide without asking you and patent it and steal your genetics.
[00:18:53.154 --> 00:18:56.317]  I mean, they shoot you up with cancer viruses and all the major vaccines.
[00:18:56.857 --> 00:18:59.740]  I'm not knocking nurses and nurse practitioners and doctors.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.123]  Most of them are very hardworking professionals that have hellish jobs that are incredibly hard.
[00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:06.525]  And have to be around disease all day.
[00:19:07.226 --> 00:19:08.427]  And sadness all day.
[00:19:08.527 --> 00:19:10.569]  It's heroic what many medical workers do.
[00:19:11.644 --> 00:19:16.034]  But, who runs it, Rockefeller medicine from above, is prime evil.
[00:19:16.996 --> 00:19:19.422]  Absolute, the core of wickedness.
[00:19:20.596 --> 00:19:21.416]  And it just goes on.
[00:19:21.996 --> 00:19:24.677]  So this is the dehumanization.
[00:19:25.277 --> 00:19:29.379]  And they burn up 4,000 stillbirths of the 15,000 they know of.
[00:19:29.439 --> 00:19:30.979]  And I'm sure it's far worse.
[00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:32.840]  And this is just all part of the dehumanization.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:41.442]  Now, when we come back, Ukraine fears Russia ready to attack as Russia takes over military bases, naval bases, massive Arctic cold hitting.
[00:19:41.462 --> 00:19:47.644]  And then we've got Homeland Security exercise targets get this, quote, free Americans against socialist tyranny.
[00:19:48.632 --> 00:19:53.254]  That's like in the other drills where they practice killing public school elementary students.
[00:19:53.294 --> 00:19:57.255]  They tell them, we're here from the pro-gun group of Republicans to kill you!
[00:19:57.695 --> 00:19:59.256]  So the kids hate Republicans their whole life.
[00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:01.757]  I mean, that's trauma-based mind control.
[00:20:02.157 --> 00:20:07.459]  And then the big news about the worldwide libertarian takeover that could save us straight ahead.
[00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:08.099]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:09.997 --> 00:20:12.558]  Did you know that gold and silver contain healing properties?
[00:20:12.798 --> 00:20:13.238]  It's true.
[00:20:13.398 --> 00:20:19.841]  Since the beginning of mankind's history, gold and silver have not only been used as real money, but also for healing our minds and bodies.

[00:21:09.824 --> 00:21:10.204]  Hi there.
[00:21:10.825 --> 00:21:11.885]  My name is Frank Bates.
[00:21:12.346 --> 00:21:15.568]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[00:21:16.168 --> 00:21:24.954]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[00:21:25.314 --> 00:21:31.338]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:33.600]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:39.304]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[00:21:40.024 --> 00:21:47.110]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[00:21:47.971 --> 00:21:52.874]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[00:21:53.555 --> 00:21:59.440]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:05.384]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[00:22:05.785 --> 00:22:07.046]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:14.670]  What I'm about to tell you is based on information obtained from a little-known government document called FT-900.
[00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.352]  This bombshell government document contains evidence on what I believe will cause the next 9-11.
[00:22:19.552 --> 00:22:32.375]  I've just posted a video at www.next911exposed2.com that not only analyzes the contents of this document, but it walks you through the exact timeline of how and when this 9-11 event is scheduled to occur.
[00:22:33.055 --> 00:22:37.878]  Just like 9-11 had a lasting impact on our society, this event will reshape America.
[00:22:38.118 --> 00:22:44.822]  It will swipe trillions off markets and retirement accounts everywhere and destroy the way of life of millions of unprepared Americans.
[00:22:45.342 --> 00:22:50.165]  But it will also trigger what promises to be the biggest wealth transfer in the history of our nation.
[00:22:50.706 --> 00:22:55.829]  But you only have a few weeks left to take all the necessary steps to protect yourself and your family.
[00:22:56.289 --> 00:23:01.936]  Just visit www.next911exposed2.com to view my newly released video.
[00:23:02.276 --> 00:23:07.723]  Again, that's www.next911exposed2.com before it's too late.
[00:23:08.424 --> 00:23:10.987]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:11.247 --> 00:23:12.989]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk.
[00:23:13.209 --> 00:23:16.111]  ...and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:23:16.352 --> 00:23:24.238]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:24.478 --> 00:23:28.781]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[00:23:29.001 --> 00:23:32.824]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:32.985 --> 00:23:38.689]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:41.691]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:47.295]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[00:23:47.455 --> 00:23:55.581]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:23:55.601 --> 00:23:55.901]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:23:55.941 --> 00:23:58.824]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[00:23:58.844 --> 00:23:59.784]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex.
[00:24:16.249 --> 00:24:16.629]  Welcome.
[00:24:17.109 --> 00:24:18.210]  Thank you again for joining us.
[00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:21.672]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, if you just tuned in.
[00:24:21.732 --> 00:24:29.235]  Coming up in the next segment, the strange revival of Republican America and how that ties into trends worldwide that we've already organically seen.
[00:24:29.795 --> 00:24:38.139]  And I'm not tooting our horn, but we were the first to be focusing on this about a year ago and now it's been picked up by Bloomberg.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.642]  Banker deaths leave industry concerned as coroners probe.
[00:24:45.293 --> 00:24:52.596]  And when I said, and it got picked up by the Epoch Times and a bunch of others, that 20-plus bankers have already died, that was a gestalt low-level number.
[00:24:53.697 --> 00:25:00.380]  In the last year, it's been, it's gotta be like 15 Goldman Sachs high-level bankers jumping off buildings.
[00:25:02.621 --> 00:25:05.882]  You know, JP Morgan, it's every couple days.
[00:25:06.662 --> 00:25:07.903]  So I don't know what the number is.
[00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:07.903]  50?
[00:25:07.943 --> 00:25:09.284]  100?
[00:25:08.103 --> 00:25:09.284]  I don't know.
[00:25:10.084 --> 00:25:12.285]  Somebody's gotta, I mean, I see it every couple days.
[00:25:13.274 --> 00:25:17.516]  And we've been hammering this report, and finally it's being probed as suspicious.
[00:25:17.556 --> 00:25:18.016]  No kidding.
[00:25:19.096 --> 00:25:20.317]  They're being found hung.
[00:25:23.038 --> 00:25:29.681]  Anybody associated with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, major globalist institutions, they are covering up folks that know where the bodies are buried.
[00:25:29.741 --> 00:25:30.161]  Ratholes.
[00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:37.224]  People they use mid-level, high-level to carry out the criminal activity so higher-ups can deny that they know what's going on.
[00:25:37.684 --> 00:25:39.485]  You're the first people that get killed.
[00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:40.465]  Little newsflash.
[00:25:43.124 --> 00:25:45.830]  You think you're so trusted and you're so high up in these institutions?
[00:25:46.151 --> 00:25:46.832]  You're dead!
[00:25:49.478 --> 00:25:50.720]  By your own master's hands.
[00:25:51.613 --> 00:25:54.215]  Because the collapse hasn't happened yet.
[00:25:54.615 --> 00:25:55.476]  Now, I said I'd cover that.
[00:25:55.496 --> 00:25:56.117]  I'm already covering it.
[00:25:56.157 --> 00:25:56.937]  That's going to be coming up.
[00:25:57.818 --> 00:26:02.222]  First off, let's go to DrugsReport.com and punch it up on screen for TV viewers right now.
[00:26:03.363 --> 00:26:06.265]  You can see aborted babies incinerated to heat hospitals.
[00:26:06.745 --> 00:26:07.626]  We're going to cover that more.
[00:26:07.646 --> 00:26:16.913]  And then under a very important article out of CBS News, Vatican Chief Justice Obama's policies have become progressively more hostile towards Christian civilization.
[00:26:17.834 --> 00:26:18.816]  Yeah, that's an understatement.
[00:26:19.356 --> 00:26:20.558]  But you've got to tell it like it is.
[00:26:21.159 --> 00:26:22.881]  The globalists want to be God.
[00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:24.143]  They want the state to be God.
[00:26:24.623 --> 00:26:26.626]  They don't like anti-abortion groups.
[00:26:27.066 --> 00:26:28.208]  They don't like pro-life groups.
[00:26:28.228 --> 00:26:29.249]  They don't like pro-gun groups.
[00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:30.391]  They don't like pro-family groups.
[00:26:31.052 --> 00:26:33.114]  And so they're trying to make Christian churches
[00:26:34.338 --> 00:26:42.602]  Promote abortion and promote, you know, hiring people that aren't Christians, which is an absolute violation of the First Amendment.
[00:26:43.243 --> 00:26:46.524]  Now, let's move on to the other article at Drudge, linked in red.
[00:26:46.544 --> 00:26:49.366]  We'll put it back up on screen on the right-hand side.
[00:26:52.007 --> 00:26:56.329]  It's the InfoWars.com article that I mentioned, and this story needs to go viral, folks.
[00:26:56.369 --> 00:26:57.650]  This is a big deal.
[00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:04.027]  And right under it, oh, the drones they were denying that were already operating domestically?
[00:27:04.668 --> 00:27:08.330]  Drone armed with taser, eyed by military law enforcement.
[00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:16.496]  They had these at South by Southwest being shopped to the police that face scan you and taser you in Austin.
[00:27:16.976 --> 00:27:20.999]  And the APD is looking at buying drones that fly around tasering you.
[00:27:21.959 --> 00:27:22.980]  Now wait a minute, AP.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.922]  Two years ago you said I was lying, that didn't exist.
[00:27:26.402 --> 00:27:28.484]  Even though I had government documents.
[00:27:29.372 --> 00:27:31.133]  Now, let's shift gears back into the top story.
[00:27:33.194 --> 00:27:45.381]  This article I'm about to cover does not operate on its own in some purgatory like Napoleon on the island of Alba.
[00:27:46.961 --> 00:27:55.126]  This is part of the overall shift of the FBI, Homeland Security, Justice Department, BATF,
[00:27:56.144 --> 00:28:07.655]  Local police to being commissar political officers targeting domestic dissent and shilling free speech in the press in conservative libertarian
[00:28:09.835 --> 00:28:13.518]  Veteran, pro-life, constitutional circles.
[00:28:14.119 --> 00:28:18.463]  There are hundreds of Homeland Security memos and documents.
[00:28:18.483 --> 00:28:19.443]  You've seen it.
[00:28:19.503 --> 00:28:23.287]  It's in Forbes and the Associated Press and West Point.
[00:28:23.307 --> 00:28:28.331]  You know, they train them to quote, take on the Tea Party in an insurrection.
[00:28:29.932 --> 00:28:31.714]  Army Times, Stars and Stripes.
[00:28:33.515 --> 00:28:35.637]  In the last six years, it's all gone public.
[00:28:35.657 --> 00:28:37.139]  It was going on behind the scenes before that.
[00:28:37.864 --> 00:28:39.859]  The bureaucracy was training to take on the American people.
[00:28:41.007 --> 00:28:49.890]  But now it's going main line with TSA on the streets as the domestic security force just as big, just as strong as our military.
[00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.231]  Close quote, Barack Obama.
[00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:53.831]  Queue up that clip.
[00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:55.792]  I want to play it in the next segment to remind folks.
[00:28:56.492 --> 00:29:03.055]  We need a civilian security force, a domestic security force just as big, just as strong as our military.
[00:29:03.395 --> 00:29:06.056]  When I come back, I'm going to read this article because it's very important.
[00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:07.456]  And we need you to tweet it.
[00:29:08.036 --> 00:29:09.317]  Retweet it from real Alex Jones.
[00:29:10.154 --> 00:29:11.054]  And from Drudge's tweet.
[00:29:11.694 --> 00:29:14.095]  We need you to put it on your Facebook.
[00:29:14.315 --> 00:29:21.457]  They're trying to censor us on Facebook and all these other places and trying to block our viral memes because this truth can bring them down.
[00:29:23.198 --> 00:29:32.340]  This can expose the treason of criminal elements of the bureaucracy ordering the police and military to prepare for war with us.
[00:29:35.241 --> 00:29:35.841]  They don't want them
[00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.472]  But no, they don't want the public to know that this treasonous build-up is happening.
[00:29:40.772 --> 00:29:46.395]  But we're here, like Paul Revere's 21st Century, warning you at InfoWars.com.
[00:29:46.916 --> 00:29:47.936]  You're Paul Revere's.
[00:29:48.817 --> 00:29:56.822]  I'm not asking you, I'm not even begging you, if you want to survive, if you want to beat these people, then go to InfoWars.com, get this article out to everybody.
[00:29:56.842 --> 00:29:58.082]  We're going to cover it when we come back.
[00:29:59.023 --> 00:29:59.923]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.204 --> 00:30:02.025]  Big new developments, folks.
[00:30:02.945 --> 00:30:05.607]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.722]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:30:12.962 --> 00:30:17.846]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:30:18.106 --> 00:30:25.972]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:30:26.233 --> 00:30:30.536]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:30:30.756 --> 00:30:34.559]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:40.420]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.441]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:30:43.821 --> 00:30:49.062]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:30:49.202 --> 00:30:57.324]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:30:57.344 --> 00:30:57.564]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:31:04.646 --> 00:31:20.360]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.502]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:31:22.702 --> 00:31:23.382]  Fluoride.
[00:31:23.582 --> 00:31:25.163]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:25.503 --> 00:31:31.805]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:31:32.086 --> 00:31:36.867]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:31:37.007 --> 00:31:43.110]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:45.491]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:31:45.751 --> 00:31:48.372]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:31:48.672 --> 00:31:52.053]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:31:52.173 --> 00:31:57.399]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:57.599 --> 00:32:02.405]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[00:32:02.705 --> 00:32:03.766]  I take it every day.
[00:32:03.906 --> 00:32:06.770]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:09.993 --> 00:32:13.236]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:32:13.336 --> 00:32:15.578]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:24.066]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:32:24.346 --> 00:32:34.536]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:32:34.896 --> 00:32:48.302]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:32:48.703 --> 00:32:56.046]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose for a limited time.
[00:32:56.246 --> 00:33:03.676]  We are offering 15% off Supermail Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[00:33:03.796 --> 00:33:07.761]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality.
[00:33:07.962 --> 00:33:08.783]  InfoWarsLife.com
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.341]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:30.601 --> 00:33:31.761]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:32.261 --> 00:33:36.783]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.387 --> 00:33:49.028]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:49.228 --> 00:33:50.268]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:50.748]  Central.
[00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:53.469]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:33:53.529 --> 00:33:54.009]  Eastern.
[00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:55.070]  We're here.
[00:33:56.614 --> 00:33:58.575]  And folks, we got an ax to grind with the New World Order.
[00:33:58.615 --> 00:34:00.096]  We got chips on both shoulders.
[00:34:00.777 --> 00:34:03.179]  We know who the author of our discontent is.
[00:34:03.739 --> 00:34:05.921]  We know who's usurping us and dominating us.
[00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:13.387]  And we're gonna wipe that slimy, trendy, fascist smile off these pot-bellied, chicken-necked pieces of garbage.
[00:34:15.808 --> 00:34:17.410]  I want more freedom!
[00:34:19.411 --> 00:34:21.273]  More power to the people!
[00:34:23.334 --> 00:34:27.838]  And we're gonna bang our heads like battering rams up against their little heads.
[00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:29.780]  We're gonna find out who's got thicker skulls.
[00:34:33.123 --> 00:34:34.665]  We're gonna wake the dead!
[00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:38.848]  We're gonna cure you mad!
[00:34:41.831 --> 00:34:42.792]  The people are dead.
[00:34:42.832 --> 00:34:43.553]  They're sleeping.
[00:34:43.953 --> 00:34:45.174]  They're under mind control.
[00:34:46.255 --> 00:34:47.296]  It's time to wake them up.
[00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:47.817]  Crank it up!
[00:34:55.319 --> 00:35:04.284]  I really wanna be overrated.
[00:35:04.444 --> 00:35:06.185]  And I ain't no weeper.
[00:35:08.587 --> 00:35:14.290]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to decide that we're not gonna be slaves.
[00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:17.032]  It's time to wake up.
[00:35:18.066 --> 00:35:19.167]  It's time to get involved.
[00:35:20.027 --> 00:35:25.449]  It's time to realize open treason is being built up and prepared all around us.
[00:35:28.151 --> 00:35:29.291]  Again, we are back live.
[00:35:29.331 --> 00:35:30.012]  I'm gonna give the number out.
[00:35:30.032 --> 00:35:32.433]  We're gonna take your calls and cover a ton of news in the next hour.
[00:35:32.473 --> 00:35:40.937]  We have so much I haven't even gotten to, but let me get back to the top story that's up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and the best place to find it
[00:35:42.082 --> 00:35:53.106]  Now, if you go to the homeschool drills that they've had at public schools, they tell them, we're homeschoolers against public education and we're here to kill you.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.822]  Or, we're pro-gun groups and we're here to kill you.
[00:36:11.842 --> 00:36:26.130]  In fact, I'm going to have Watson add all those examples to his article to show people it's part of a larger compendium of where they have these school shooting drills, federally funded, from Texas to Michigan, from California to Florida.
[00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.711]  We've seen it in just every major state.
[00:36:28.611 --> 00:36:32.714]  Minnesota, they've lost lawsuits up there where unannounced at the elementary.
[00:36:33.615 --> 00:36:40.502]  They come in with guys dressed like militia and march everybody outside and say, we don't like public school and you're all dead!
[00:36:40.542 --> 00:36:43.165]  And then they blow up a bus with a firebomb.
[00:36:43.185 --> 00:36:46.128]  I had the lawyer on, this was on the news in Minnesota.
[00:36:46.728 --> 00:36:52.013]  And then they get the teachers down on their knees with the kids and the kids are literally urinating, defecating all over themselves.
[00:36:52.314 --> 00:36:53.275]  This is in the lawsuits.
[00:36:54.557 --> 00:36:58.620]  I mean, you talk about Soviet mind-control camp right out of Red Dawn.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:08.966]  That's what a mind-control camp is, where you torture and freak everybody out until peer pressure makes families break down and tell Dad, work for the Soviet in Bulgaria!
[00:37:09.286 --> 00:37:13.649]  Go help report out your friends in the hills or they're gonna keep raping and killing us!
[00:37:14.429 --> 00:37:15.450]  Dad, do it for me!
[00:37:17.363 --> 00:37:19.904]  I mean, this is hardcore Soviet-style brainwashing.
[00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:23.987]  And they do it in public schools everywhere, and you send your kids there to do it.
[00:37:24.307 --> 00:37:27.629]  Teachers, just two weeks ago, filed suit in Missouri.
[00:37:28.652 --> 00:37:35.058]  And said, we do not want to be forced to take part in four mass shooting drills a year where we march around with our hands up.
[00:37:35.578 --> 00:37:36.939]  Or we gotta put fake blood on us.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:41.283]  Folks, there's a hundred and sixty-fives, three, it varies every year.
[00:37:41.643 --> 00:37:47.348]  It's in the hundred and sixties, on average, every year since 1992 that there are mass shootings.
[00:37:47.969 --> 00:37:52.973]  A hundred and sixty people killed every year in some type of mass shooting.
[00:37:53.093 --> 00:37:56.256]  Almost all of them are gangbangers shooting at each other.
[00:37:57.992 --> 00:37:58.493]  In schools.
[00:38:01.198 --> 00:38:02.079]  Do you understand that?
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:03.963]  Do you understand that?
[00:38:04.463 --> 00:38:05.766]  Honeybees kill over 200 people!
[00:38:07.338 --> 00:38:08.959]  I've been harping on that for years now.
[00:38:09.139 --> 00:38:12.302]  Esquire last year did a whole article admitting that.
[00:38:12.862 --> 00:38:18.626]  You got a better chance of being struck by lightning repeatedly in your lifetime, not in the same day.
[00:38:19.087 --> 00:38:25.751]  You have a better chance, look it up, World Almanac, of being struck twice in your life by lightning than by being killed by a terrorist.
[00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:31.976]  Folks, it's like finding a unicorn with a Lucky Charms elf riding it.
[00:38:33.482 --> 00:38:37.763]  You got a better chance, folks, of finding a Chewbacabra in your backyard, basically.
[00:38:40.703 --> 00:38:44.024]  Almost 400 people die every year from deer jumping out in front of their cars.
[00:38:44.664 --> 00:38:46.964]  Do we have checkpoints to stop the deer everywhere?
[00:38:47.305 --> 00:38:48.045]  Game fences?
[00:38:48.705 --> 00:38:51.585]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're not going to make it out of this world alive.
[00:38:51.865 --> 00:38:52.726]  You're going to die!
[00:38:54.566 --> 00:38:56.706]  Alcohol kills 300,000 people a year on average.
[00:38:56.726 --> 00:38:58.146]  You're going to stop everybody drinking?
[00:38:58.447 --> 00:38:59.567]  Cigarettes, hundreds of thousands.
[00:38:59.627 --> 00:39:00.587]  Cars, hundreds of thousands.
[00:39:01.795 --> 00:39:07.520]  Mass shootings, 260 with change.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.261]  Never gone above 170.
[00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:10.242]  I'm ranting.
[00:39:11.183 --> 00:39:12.003]  Let me get to this article.
[00:39:12.644 --> 00:39:13.504]  It's just everywhere.
[00:39:13.564 --> 00:39:14.445]  They drill now.
[00:39:15.006 --> 00:39:18.008]  Like, you know, the Army used to drill to fight the Russians in the 70s and 80s.
[00:39:18.669 --> 00:39:19.609]  60s, 70s, 80s.
[00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.192]  The Air Force drilled to fight foreign aircraft.
[00:39:24.293 --> 00:39:27.516]  The FBI drilled to fight, quote, organized crime and foreign infiltrators.
[00:39:28.316 --> 00:39:30.278]  The CIA supposedly, you know, did that.
[00:39:32.096 --> 00:39:34.938]  To stop foreign governments coming and infiltrating and stealing cigarettes.
[00:39:35.278 --> 00:39:36.379]  Do you know what they do now?
[00:39:36.399 --> 00:39:41.223]  Do you know what their main mission announced by Janet Napolitano six years ago is?
[00:39:42.704 --> 00:39:44.545]  Do you know what their mission is announced every month?
[00:39:44.965 --> 00:39:46.126]  The FBI announced last year.
[00:39:46.406 --> 00:39:48.628]  We no longer worry about crime.
[00:39:48.668 --> 00:39:49.649]  That's not our main focus.
[00:39:50.049 --> 00:39:51.450]  It's domestic extremism.
[00:39:53.071 --> 00:39:56.133]  How many domestic extremists killed people last year?
[00:39:57.354 --> 00:39:58.315]  It's less than 10 people.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:04.362]  On the Southern Poverty Law Center's own website, and they're really scratching for numbers there.
[00:40:04.382 --> 00:40:04.902]  10 people?
[00:40:07.063 --> 00:40:08.824]  Oh, but it's like Great White Sharks, they kill 5 people.
[00:40:09.224 --> 00:40:09.905]  Every year on average.
[00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:11.845]  Highest number ever is 12.
[00:40:12.186 --> 00:40:12.526]  Recorded.
[00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:16.748]  Everyone I know is scared to swim in the ocean, including the Caribbean.
[00:40:17.688 --> 00:40:18.969]  Because they think sharks are going to eat them.
[00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.709]  Almost everyone I know.
[00:40:22.383 --> 00:40:24.925]  There is no great white shark in the Caribbean, Dumbo.
[00:40:25.686 --> 00:40:29.409]  Some of them occasionally come in in the winter into the Gulf of Mexico out of the Atlantic.
[00:40:30.871 --> 00:40:33.433]  There are no great white attacks in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:40:34.494 --> 00:40:35.955]  There are none in the Caribbean.
[00:40:37.136 --> 00:40:39.979]  There are sperm whales and pilot whales in the Southern Caribbean.
[00:40:41.107 --> 00:40:43.427]  I mean, people just are scared of everything!
[00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:47.008]  It's just everything that isn't scary, everything that isn't a threat.
[00:40:47.188 --> 00:41:01.070]  And then I'm scared of a big monolithic government, when historically, and what our founders said and common sense shows, the red-level, 100% real boogeyman that keeps me up at night just got chills.
[00:41:02.331 --> 00:41:04.111]  I really do get chills, chill bumps.
[00:41:04.131 --> 00:41:06.851]  262 million non-military deaths.
[00:41:10.805 --> 00:41:12.386]  In the 20th century by government.
[00:41:12.706 --> 00:41:13.867]  University of Hawaii study.
[00:41:15.408 --> 00:41:17.230]  University of Chicago has even higher numbers.
[00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:17.890]  They say 300-something mil.
[00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.831]  262 m-m-m-m-m-million.
[00:41:19.851 --> 00:41:20.352]  262 m-m-m-m-m-million.
[00:41:20.692 --> 00:41:23.194]  Not 160-something killed by mass shooters.
[00:41:32.245 --> 00:41:32.565]  A year.
[00:41:33.525 --> 00:41:39.887]  Government killed 262 million.
[00:41:40.587 --> 00:41:44.268]  And who is our loving foreign banker occupied?
[00:41:44.288 --> 00:41:45.749]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:41:45.789 --> 00:41:48.110]  We are literally run by the IMF World Bank.
[00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.330]  Federal Reserve is their domestic arm.
[00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:56.492]  We are literally run by the criminal IRS set up in 1913 to pay money into the private run for profit Federal Reserve.
[00:41:58.151 --> 00:41:59.572]  Didn't have an income tax until 1913.
[00:41:59.972 --> 00:42:05.196]  Our whole system is designed to be cold and socially engineered and controlled by these people.
[00:42:05.616 --> 00:42:09.219]  Nothing else really matters except recognizing the real political system we're under.
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:22.808]  And then meanwhile, in every Army publication, Army War College, Navy War College, Marine War Fighting School, West Point, Stars and Stripes,
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.584]  Army Times, Internal Manuals, Homeland Security Manuals, that we've broken almost all of them because people send them to us.
[00:42:31.544 --> 00:42:34.146]  And then we call the phone numbers involved and check them and read them and look at them.
[00:42:34.346 --> 00:42:37.388]  We can look at them instantly, it's always the same crud written by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:42:38.249 --> 00:42:42.271]  The Southern Poverty Law Center is basically the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with the ADL.
[00:42:43.512 --> 00:42:49.856]  And they train, and their main mission, Homeland Security and NORTHCOM have said this, is, I'm going to say it again, returning veterans, number one.
[00:42:50.276 --> 00:42:51.657]  Then veterans, your number two enemy.
[00:42:52.694 --> 00:43:02.942]  Then, libertarians, constitutionalists, conservatives, gun owners, Ron Paul supporters, they literally train the federal government.
[00:43:04.483 --> 00:43:11.008]  I mean, I've been at the gun show and seen the ATF, and they will literally look at me and start hyperventilating like I am an enemy soldier or something.
[00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:14.691]  Because they literally bat and pitch for the other team.
[00:43:14.911 --> 00:43:17.893]  They are sworn, they are in a cult, just like the mafia.
[00:43:17.974 --> 00:43:18.554]  It's their duty.
[00:43:18.754 --> 00:43:19.515]  I am the enemy.
[00:43:21.397 --> 00:43:22.097]  You understand that?
[00:43:22.177 --> 00:43:22.938]  You are the enemy.
[00:43:22.978 --> 00:43:25.699]  They train 24-7 to take your guns.
[00:43:25.719 --> 00:43:29.241]  24-7 to put you in relocation centers.
[00:43:29.261 --> 00:43:32.122]  24-7 to slap us in the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:43:32.863 --> 00:43:33.183]  Camps.
[00:43:34.363 --> 00:43:36.284]  The Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:43:36.364 --> 00:43:37.565]  Everything I'm saying is declassified.
[00:43:40.481 --> 00:43:52.052]  All those closed military bases are manned and ready, and all they want to do is set off some nukes or bioweapons, blame it on us, start a civil war that'll wipe out the police and military, because we won't have a choice when they're trying to take us.
[00:43:53.314 --> 00:43:54.535]  I mean, it's gonna be like...
[00:44:02.526 --> 00:44:12.041]  20 million hardcore Dorners that have the right on their side and are being hunted and attacked, not that are going out attacking people like Dorner did.
[00:44:13.735 --> 00:44:22.161]  I mean, you saw almost all of Southern California locked down for one guy and police shaking in fear, shooting up vehicles that didn't even match the description with white women in them.
[00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:33.550]  Can you imagine when all the retired special forces and all the military and all the former police and all the gun owners have had their families hunted down and their cousins drug off to a camp?
[00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.992]  I mean, you're not going to be safe anywhere.
[00:44:36.332 --> 00:44:37.253]  And the globalists love that.
[00:44:37.353 --> 00:44:40.775]  They know, you'll attack us, we will wipe you out.
[00:44:41.195 --> 00:44:42.877]  You will be wiped out within a year.
[00:44:43.377 --> 00:44:43.698]  Dead.
[00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:45.460]  Totally wiped out.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:50.847]  It'll be like moose hunting season, where you put into a lottery and only one out of four people gets a moose license.
[00:44:51.387 --> 00:44:52.589]  Or mountain lion hunting.
[00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.215]  Where you gotta go put in the lottery and one out of twenty gets to hunt the mountain lion.
[00:44:58.345 --> 00:45:01.026]  I mean, you'll be like dodo birds, and I'm not here threatening you.
[00:45:01.286 --> 00:45:02.266]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:45:02.286 --> 00:45:06.187]  That's the plan to wipe both sides out starting this civil war.
[00:45:06.407 --> 00:45:08.467]  And let me tell you, they're wartime training.
[00:45:09.007 --> 00:45:13.608]  Just like when they're going back into jungle warfare, they paint the tanks green two years before they've already got it planned.
[00:45:13.848 --> 00:45:16.829]  Or they're going to the desert, they paint the tanks tan two years before.
[00:45:17.269 --> 00:45:21.910]  They have been painting the trucks black for domestic war.
[00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.910]  The tanks black.
[00:45:23.939 --> 00:45:24.819]  For domestic war.
[00:45:24.879 --> 00:45:29.001]  They have been training publicly to take on gun owners during martial law.
[00:45:30.481 --> 00:45:36.203]  And they're coming, just as sure as the sun's coming up tomorrow, unless we run around like chickens with our heads cut off.
[00:45:36.223 --> 00:45:38.204]  And I'm just getting adrenaline rushes right now, folks.
[00:45:39.352 --> 00:45:43.354]  I mean, just like I was, you know, in a parking lot and some guy's trying to mug me and I get that feeling.
[00:45:43.675 --> 00:45:45.676]  I mean, this is, I just, it's all real.
[00:45:45.936 --> 00:45:46.616]  It's all happening.
[00:45:46.696 --> 00:45:51.639]  I'm pulsing with adrenaline and electricity right now because this is what they're going to do.
[00:45:51.939 --> 00:45:53.680]  We've got to stop them!
[00:45:55.241 --> 00:46:04.507]  Because they're gonna use the Civil War as the false flag to bring the country down just as sure as the sun comes up and geese fly south for the winter.
[00:46:06.274 --> 00:46:08.216]  They want to take this country down!
[00:46:09.257 --> 00:46:10.659]  They've got a score to settle with us.
[00:46:10.859 --> 00:46:12.080]  Look what came out in the Weatherman trials.
[00:46:12.401 --> 00:46:19.268]  How they were going to put 50 million conservatives, men, in forced labor camps and then kill 25 million of us.
[00:46:20.289 --> 00:46:22.832]  The numbers they'll have to kill now from 1970s numbers are over 75 million.
[00:46:27.315 --> 00:46:28.975]  They are going to rape your wives.
[00:46:29.236 --> 00:46:30.896]  People are going, oh, this is going to... Watch!
[00:46:31.196 --> 00:46:31.436]  Watch!
[00:46:31.456 --> 00:46:32.516]  You've seen everything else happen.
[00:46:32.777 --> 00:46:34.757]  They've got a score to settle.
[00:46:35.317 --> 00:46:37.218]  Do you have Obama's domestic security force, please?
[00:46:38.118 --> 00:46:40.039]  Go ahead and play Obama when he was campaigning.
[00:46:40.779 --> 00:46:47.941]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[00:46:48.741 --> 00:46:55.783]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:46:57.386 --> 00:47:00.009]  Folks, it happens in every other nation in history.
[00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.870]  It's happening here.
[00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:04.273]  If we don't wake up to the nightmare and admit it's happening, they will win.
[00:47:04.613 --> 00:47:05.634]  They will stage the events.
[00:47:05.654 --> 00:47:06.315]  Here's the good news.
[00:47:06.836 --> 00:47:10.920]  The entire military, I would say upwards of 85%, are somewhat awake now.
[00:47:13.723 --> 00:47:14.904]  Almost the entire military.
[00:47:15.104 --> 00:47:18.808]  It's an incredible conversion to reality because they're being given the treason training.
[00:47:20.305 --> 00:47:24.786]  Because we warn people up front and you warn people in Oath Keepers and countless others for decades.
[00:47:25.226 --> 00:47:26.206]  Ron Paul, you name it.
[00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:28.186]  John Byrd Society, you name it.
[00:47:28.926 --> 00:47:30.087]  About the creeping build-up.
[00:47:30.827 --> 00:47:32.047]  Clinton wanted to do this stuff.
[00:47:32.907 --> 00:47:37.108]  Because we did that, now we're catching them with their pants down, not us.
[00:47:37.368 --> 00:47:38.588]  We're not sitting here flat-footed.
[00:47:38.748 --> 00:47:39.468]  We're dug in.
[00:47:40.348 --> 00:47:42.669]  We've bought 200 million guns the last 20 years.
[00:47:43.049 --> 00:47:43.789]  Everybody's ready.
[00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:46.569]  And we're politically fighting hard to fix this country.
[00:47:46.789 --> 00:47:48.050]  We're doing everything we can.
[00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:49.630]  We're not starting anything offensively.
[00:47:50.492 --> 00:47:58.140]  We're just sitting here trying to do our best, and our duty as Americans is good people to be honorable and protect our families.
[00:47:59.882 --> 00:48:05.047]  And it isn't like we're just starting a fight with a bunch of socialists and, you know, not going along with them, which is our right.
[00:48:05.288 --> 00:48:11.154]  These are horrible, nasty communists run by foreign banks that have a vendetta against this republic.
[00:48:14.212 --> 00:48:16.493]  They want to have their way with us so bad, folks.
[00:48:16.533 --> 00:48:18.234]  We're in so much danger right now.
[00:48:18.935 --> 00:48:21.056]  Homeland Security is the domestic army to do this.
[00:48:22.056 --> 00:48:24.758]  And they've got the throngs of their followers.
[00:48:25.058 --> 00:48:26.839]  You've heard them in Austin and L.A.
[00:48:27.259 --> 00:48:30.381]  and other places say they want to put all gun owners in camps.
[00:48:31.297 --> 00:48:37.140]  They will man those camps with pot-bellied jail guard socialists who will literally stomp our guts out.
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.580]  We don't have a choice.
[00:48:39.141 --> 00:48:43.002]  We've got to work as hard as we can to try to fix this before they start pulling triggers.
[00:48:43.443 --> 00:48:48.605]  And once they pull triggers, folks, we've got to go info war 110% and defend ourselves.
[00:48:49.645 --> 00:48:54.928]  But remember, remember police and military.
[00:48:56.786 --> 00:49:02.508]  When they shoot up your convoys and blow up daycare centers and the rest of it up front, that is not the Liberty Movement doing that.
[00:49:02.888 --> 00:49:08.289]  Don't be stupid and run out and find the first Patriots you can to shoot up in their house and burn down.
[00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:17.072]  Because you do that, the next wave's coming in and I'm telling you, I'm telling you, then the gloves are off and you know what's going to happen.
[00:49:18.512 --> 00:49:25.334]  The former military people have already been casing their neighborhoods and have already been creating files and you know that and you know what's going to happen to you.
[00:49:26.283 --> 00:49:29.345]  You do that, you don't do the right thing, you know what's going to happen.
[00:49:29.665 --> 00:49:31.286]  You're going to get smashed bad.
[00:49:31.866 --> 00:49:32.986]  And I don't want that to happen.
[00:49:33.066 --> 00:49:36.988]  I want you to wake up, look at the intelligence information, and join the Republic.
[00:49:37.749 --> 00:49:40.150]  Join 1776 in the spirit of George Washington.
[00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:42.611]  Don't join the spirit of Obama and George Soros.
[00:49:43.351 --> 00:49:44.712]  Ask which side you're on right now.
[00:49:45.112 --> 00:49:50.295]  Because they're training in every manual to kill anti-socialists during martial law.
[00:49:52.247 --> 00:49:54.778]  Now, here's the new Homeland Security Manual we got.
[00:49:54.798 --> 00:49:56.205]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:57.574 --> 00:50:01.336]  Homeland Security exercise targets free Americans against socialist tyranny.
[00:50:01.396 --> 00:50:05.378]  Leaked documents reveal plan to counter online dissent during martial law.
[00:50:06.058 --> 00:50:22.046]  Leaked Homeland Security documents obtained by InfoWars reveal details of joint DHS-FEMA national exercise set to take place this week, one of the components of which revolves around an effort to counter online dissent by a group called Free Americans Against Socialist Tyranny.
[00:50:22.326 --> 00:50:24.847]  What a horrible group, Free Americans Against Socialist Tyranny.
[00:50:25.287 --> 00:50:26.528]  I can't think of anything worse, can you?
[00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:35.217]  Which is disgruntled at the imposition of martial law after an earthquake in Alaska.
[00:50:36.379 --> 00:50:42.806]  The document again underscores the federal government's obsession with characterizing libertarians and conservatives as some kind of extremist radical threat.
[00:50:43.406 --> 00:50:45.649]  Well, we're like antibiotics, a threat to a deadly bacteria.
[00:50:45.689 --> 00:50:46.190]  We are a threat.
[00:50:47.133 --> 00:50:48.274]  Bacteria wants to kill us!
[00:50:48.294 --> 00:50:52.757]  You think the Jedi were a threat to the Sith?
[00:50:52.818 --> 00:50:55.159]  I mean, it's just... It's real simple.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:01.925]  The document, PDF, was leaked by an individual affiliated with Stuart Rhodes' organization, Oath Keepers, and passed to InfoWars.
[00:51:02.245 --> 00:51:06.028]  It's entitled, National Exercise Program, Catastrophe Exercise 2014.
[00:51:06.068 --> 00:51:09.691]  Yeah, he needs to add the previous national level exercises.
[00:51:10.828 --> 00:51:13.929]  How can you save a ton of money and prepare for emergencies?
[00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:17.230]  By having your own in-home freeze dryer from Harvest Rite.

[00:54:25.234 --> 00:54:26.576]  And I'm super bad!
[00:54:49.076 --> 00:54:58.765]  And by the way, when he says super bad for squares out there that aren't trendy, you know, if you weren't trendy back in the 50s, you didn't know what he meant, James Brown.
[00:54:58.845 --> 00:55:02.388]  Bad doesn't mean actually bad, it means like bad, as in bad.
[00:55:02.828 --> 00:55:04.129]  I know everybody knows that, that's a joke.
[00:55:06.251 --> 00:55:07.512]  And I'm super bad!
[00:55:08.653 --> 00:55:14.098]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, back to the folks that really are super bad, but not in a bad, good way, in a bad, bad way.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.941]  It goes on, the document is intended for U.S.
[00:55:20.961 --> 00:55:23.523]  Department of Homeland Security trusted agents only.
[00:55:23.963 --> 00:55:25.664]  Trusted traders only.
[00:55:25.684 --> 00:55:34.628]  I mean, anybody that gets given this stuff about where they're training to fight conservatives during martial law, I mean, you should realize this is a takeover group.
[00:55:35.928 --> 00:55:38.450]  Well, I'm just going to go along with it and keep my pension.
[00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:41.191]  You're not going to keep your pension, dummy.
[00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:43.252]  That's why they're bringing tyranny in.
[00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:47.150]  Liberty produces prosperity.
[00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.292]  Tyranny produces third world garbage.
[00:55:49.852 --> 00:55:51.453]  I'm going to try to explain that again to you guys.
[00:55:54.976 --> 00:56:01.300]  Sometimes I'll be out in public or at the gym or something, I'll see some guy, give me the right looks, and I'll go over and I'll go, you're a fed, aren't you?
[00:56:03.001 --> 00:56:04.082]  What's it to you, Jones?
[00:56:05.543 --> 00:56:06.524]  Now, it's not always like that.
[00:56:06.544 --> 00:56:09.388]  A lot of them's feds come over and like, oh, a lot of us are awake and know what's going on.
[00:56:09.848 --> 00:56:19.100]  But immediately, you can see the guy was like a little kid and his dad was a cop and he thinks he's a secret agent and on a power trip and he's a good guy and you're a bad guy and I mean, you just see it.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.041]  They're childlike minds.
[00:56:20.321 --> 00:56:21.703]  I can pick them out of a crowd.
[00:56:21.743 --> 00:56:22.484]  It's so pathetic.
[00:56:23.405 --> 00:56:24.746]  The trusted agent types.
[00:56:25.933 --> 00:56:27.395]  Trusted Turd is your real name.
[00:56:28.236 --> 00:56:31.181]  George Washington would literally tell you, get away from him.
[00:56:31.281 --> 00:56:35.947]  I mean, you are so traitorous, trying to take on veterans and gun owners.
[00:56:36.168 --> 00:56:37.530]  You are so evil!
[00:56:39.292 --> 00:56:46.696]  But you're nothing compared to the people that pull your strings, like Eric Holder, the mobster, the guy that ships guns into Mexico to false flag the Second Amendment.
[00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:48.957]  You notice we're blowing every one of your operations.
[00:56:49.597 --> 00:56:55.941]  Boston bombing, Fast and Furious, Solyndra, Benghazi, because there's good people in every agency, especially the Pentagon.
[00:56:56.321 --> 00:56:59.623]  And it's game over, because you can't stop them and they know how to leak information.
[00:57:01.343 --> 00:57:02.924]  We already have your whole game plan anyways.
[00:57:02.964 --> 00:57:04.104]  I don't even need the information.
[00:57:04.324 --> 00:57:07.605]  I know your entire battle plan, the different operations you've got.
[00:57:08.065 --> 00:57:10.626]  I know that you don't know when you're going to get orders to do what.
[00:57:10.906 --> 00:57:14.988]  That's the only reason I don't know everything, is because you don't know what you're going to do.
[00:57:15.408 --> 00:57:18.769]  Because we've got you off balance, and we're going to continue to do that.
[00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.091]  You think you're going to gut the Republic this easily?
[00:57:22.111 --> 00:57:23.051]  Never.
[00:57:24.992 --> 00:57:26.912]  You think all of us are cowards and will roll over?
[00:57:27.392 --> 00:57:28.613]  We love a good fight!
[00:57:30.811 --> 00:57:31.831]  Let's continue here.
[00:57:31.912 --> 00:57:35.073]  The document is intended for U.S., this is a quote, U.S.
[00:57:35.093 --> 00:57:39.815]  Department of Homeland Security trusted agents only, close quote.
[00:57:40.716 --> 00:57:45.058]  And is, quote, disseminated only on a need-to-know basis.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.262]  Even the role players involved in the exercise itself are prohibited from seeing the files.
[00:57:56.903 --> 00:57:57.784]  And it goes over it.
[00:57:59.031 --> 00:58:06.526]  How they're going to fight people physically but also online who are trying to speak out against the socialist takeover of America.
[00:58:06.807 --> 00:58:07.949]  I'm actually reading from the document.
[00:58:09.389 --> 00:58:15.693]  On page 125 of the document, a scenario is outlined whereby a group calling itself Free Americans Against Socialist Tyranny responds to the U.S.
[00:58:15.733 --> 00:58:27.320]  Northern Command mission of defense support, that's gun confiscation, to civilian authorities, or the imposition of martial law by launching a protest campaign on social media and potentially engaging in cyber attacks.
[00:58:27.601 --> 00:58:29.342]  They consider free speech a cyber attack.
[00:58:29.602 --> 00:58:37.447]  Don't worry, NORTHCOM swings in and then it goes into talking about Northern Command and the civil authorities dealing with the troublemakers.
[00:58:41.238 --> 00:58:43.000]  All right, folks, training for treason.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.262]  Second hour, a ton of other news.
[00:58:45.542 --> 00:58:46.664]  Your phone calls.
[00:58:47.104 --> 00:58:48.846]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:50.528 --> 00:58:51.509]  Thank you for listening.
[00:58:51.529 --> 00:58:52.169]  Get the article.
[00:58:52.249 --> 00:58:52.970]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:58.716]  Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it out!
[00:58:59.881 --> 00:59:01.522]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:59:01.782 --> 00:59:05.285]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:59:05.425 --> 00:59:09.828]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:59:09.988 --> 00:59:15.952]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:59:16.072 --> 00:59:26.860]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:33.382]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:59:33.562 --> 00:59:50.508]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:00:02.904 --> 01:00:04.827]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.288 --> 01:00:08.091]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.795 --> 01:00:20.058]  Man, when I look at the kleptocratic, decepticon, fake liberal, tyrant-loving, tyranny-supporting, Obama-pushing media,
[01:00:45.214 --> 01:00:46.234]  The way they lie!
[01:00:46.254 --> 01:00:49.255]  There's no drones, there's no checkpoints, there's no NSA spying.
[01:00:50.595 --> 01:00:52.776]  Why, Matt Drudge is lying!
[01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:59.618]  There's no penalty, $5,000 penalty, or even more, of your family on not getting Obamacare.
[01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:04.179]  That starts next year, not if you're a small business, the way the bill's written.
[01:01:05.019 --> 01:01:06.839]  Matt Drudge is a liar!
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.000]  I see that all over the news.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:12.621]  I mean, they really... I guess if you're going to tell one lie, why not tell 10,000 lies?
[01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:15.891]  So we've got that.
[01:01:15.911 --> 01:01:17.452]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:01:17.672 --> 01:01:38.881]  If you just joined us, I was covering our story that's up on InfoWars.com, where Homeland Security across the country trains to wage war on gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans, and quote, anyone who is a quote, free American against socialist tyranny, and that they're going to cyber attack anyone that tries to speak up during martial law.
[01:01:41.826 --> 01:01:52.038]  I mean, this is just absolute treason, and I want to not even come in but say thank you for joining Free Humanity, the folks that leaked this to us via Oath Keepers.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.623]  And we're going to continue to get all the intel, folks.
[01:01:56.323 --> 01:01:58.146]  You can't scare everybody, okay?
[01:01:58.206 --> 01:02:00.508]  What if your own system doesn't want to slit its own throat?
[01:02:01.394 --> 01:02:05.557]  Any moron can know tyranny does not produce prosperity.
[01:02:06.398 --> 01:02:09.640]  Most people in Homeland Security have traveled to the third world more than the average person.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.743]  They know what big government and corruption looks like and don't want any part of it.
[01:02:15.084 --> 01:02:20.788]  The globalists are just sharpening their knives to carve this country up completely and secure their ill-gotten gains.
[01:02:22.079 --> 01:02:30.486]  We're just going to continue to win and prove that we're the real liberals, the real libertarians, the real freedom lovers, and that the Republican and Democratic parties at the top are totally rotten.
[01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:33.368]  I'm going to cover that at the start of the next segment and start going to your phone calls.
[01:02:33.788 --> 01:02:34.969]  Here is the really good news.
[01:02:36.911 --> 01:02:39.473]  If we seize the day.
[01:02:39.493 --> 01:02:41.495]  How do you say that in Latin?
[01:02:43.436 --> 01:02:44.137]  Carpe diem.
[01:02:46.101 --> 01:02:53.204]  Which is what Julius Caesar, I think, meant by, there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune.
[01:02:53.925 --> 01:02:59.667]  My fortune is prosperity for my children and freedom and dignity and a culture based on chivalry and honor.
[01:03:00.748 --> 01:03:04.890]  And based on powerful male role models and powerful feminine role models.
[01:03:06.195 --> 01:03:09.877]  I went around the office encouraging the women that are here and offering to pay for it.
[01:03:09.897 --> 01:03:11.618]  I can't pay for the state fees.
[01:03:13.519 --> 01:03:22.925]  I guess I could pay for those, but I mean, that's for them to pay, but I'm paying or got it set up where they would get a concealed carry lesson and get their concealed carry license.
[01:03:24.005 --> 01:03:35.312]  There was only a few women in here that didn't have their guns, but I said, listen, I'll get you free class with Central Texas Gun Works, great folks over there, if you'll go take it.
[01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:39.119]  Because I'm against women, folks.
[01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:40.160]  I'm against women being in power.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.341]  That's why I want them all to have guns.
[01:03:41.361 --> 01:03:46.586]  Gloria Steinem wants you sterilized, because she wants to empower you.
[01:03:46.626 --> 01:03:47.266]  She said so.
[01:03:47.306 --> 01:03:49.068]  I mean, the CIA said so.
[01:03:49.148 --> 01:03:50.209]  I mean, it's American, right?
[01:03:50.509 --> 01:03:51.550]  No, it's British intelligence.
[01:03:52.251 --> 01:03:52.751]  Set up 1947 on record.
[01:03:59.164 --> 01:04:00.985]  And I'm not blaming the British, let's get that clear.
[01:04:01.245 --> 01:04:23.377]  It's the group that used the British blood and factories and war-like intelligence and scientific vigor to build the greatest empire the world had ever seen that we broke away from that simply re-merged in 1922 in New York City with Pratt House and the CFR and that since amalgamated and basically the British Empire got absorbed by the American Empire.
[01:04:27.765 --> 01:04:42.471]  But the soul, the mind of the Britannic Empire infested and possessed the Ghost of the Machine, America, and became the giant, satanic war mock that we now are.
[01:04:44.192 --> 01:04:46.333]  A giant, satanic battleship of evil.
[01:04:47.881 --> 01:04:55.165]  But we still have great good in us, so the destiny of the world does lie for good or ill in this republic.
[01:04:55.205 --> 01:04:59.287]  And that's why the battle for 1776, will it be an Illuminati 1776?
[01:04:59.947 --> 01:05:02.808]  They always launch their counterfeit, Adam Weishaupt.
[01:05:03.389 --> 01:05:04.870]  Or will it be the George Washington?
[01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.370]  True 1775, 1776.
[01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:06.270]  I choose George Washington.
[01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:10.911]  The facts are in.
[01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:12.192]  The studies are legion.
[01:05:12.472 --> 01:05:19.834]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:05:19.994 --> 01:05:23.455]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:05:23.815 --> 01:05:24.216]  Simple.
[01:05:24.376 --> 01:05:28.797]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:05:29.097 --> 01:05:34.539]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:05:34.819 --> 01:05:40.182]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:05:40.362 --> 01:05:50.807]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:55.391]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:05:55.712 --> 01:05:57.574]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:05:57.874 --> 01:06:03.179]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:06:03.439 --> 01:06:07.684]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:06:07.844 --> 01:06:09.125]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:10.126 --> 01:06:15.734]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:06:15.935 --> 01:06:23.165]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:06:23.325 --> 01:06:26.470]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.451]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:06:28.691 --> 01:06:33.253]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:06:33.353 --> 01:06:36.095]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:06:36.255 --> 01:06:42.038]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:06:42.218 --> 01:06:45.680]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.942]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[01:06:51.142 --> 01:06:54.124]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:54.364 --> 01:07:00.233]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:07:00.353 --> 01:07:02.356]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[01:07:02.517 --> 01:07:07.885]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:09.407]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:10.308 --> 01:07:13.051]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:18.156]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:07:18.336 --> 01:07:25.523]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:07:25.643 --> 01:07:31.067]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:07:31.287 --> 01:07:35.030]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:39.834]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:07:40.034 --> 01:07:45.258]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:07:45.498 --> 01:07:48.581]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:07:48.741 --> 01:07:51.003]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:07:51.243 --> 01:07:55.807]  Therosafe, used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:07:56.007 --> 01:07:58.450]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:05.936]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:08:06.096 --> 01:08:07.137]  We're getting prepared.
[01:08:07.378 --> 01:08:07.778]  Are you?
[01:08:08.038 --> 01:08:09.139]  Infowarshop.com
[01:08:24.418 --> 01:08:30.500]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:31.181 --> 01:08:36.403]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:37.483 --> 01:08:39.584]  The British Empire had never been beaten.
[01:08:39.624 --> 01:08:41.704]  They thought they would disarm the colonists.
[01:08:42.965 --> 01:08:48.107]  Over the next seven years, we stomped them into the ground by perseverance, losing almost every battle.
[01:08:49.266 --> 01:08:51.007]  But winning the overall war.
[01:08:51.147 --> 01:08:53.808]  Because resistance is victory.
[01:08:54.168 --> 01:08:55.729]  Bankrupting the British Empire.
[01:08:56.369 --> 01:08:57.410]  Just like the Afghans.
[01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:58.050]  Don't give up.
[01:08:59.831 --> 01:09:02.912]  Same thing happened when Santa Ana came to confiscate the guns.
[01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.453]  Texans were not going to be slaves.
[01:09:05.902 --> 01:09:18.248]  And it doesn't matter if 30-40% of the public can't tie their shoelaces and worship Obama and maybe 20 other percent worship mainline Republicans and want to go to country clubs and be patted on the head by rhino neocons.
[01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:24.751]  We have a large 30-40% of the public that is pretty awake right now and they're accelerating that awakening.
[01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:27.532]  80 plus percent of the military
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:42.148]  is somewhat awake to hyper awake and that conversion that awakening is steaming towards ninety percent because the the training is so treasonous where they literally army marine corps
[01:09:43.948 --> 01:09:44.489]  You name it.
[01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:46.971]  Train in drills.
[01:09:46.991 --> 01:09:50.093]  We've shot video of this many times, but this is what keeps coming out in the news.
[01:09:50.574 --> 01:09:55.738]  With a bunch of guys in overalls on tractors wearing John Deere hats going, I want my guns!
[01:09:56.138 --> 01:09:59.861]  And the Marines get out and practice shooting them and literally go, what is this?
[01:10:00.122 --> 01:10:01.122]  That's my grandpa!
[01:10:03.885 --> 01:10:06.067]  I mean, that's who they train to kill.
[01:10:07.893 --> 01:10:13.814]  So, and they're like, we used to hear this from that Alex Jones guy on Oath Keepers and Ron Paul, what's going on here?
[01:10:15.534 --> 01:10:22.596]  And they go home on leave to see their wife and kids, and they go over to their dad's house who's, you know, a Marine Corps retired colonel.
[01:10:24.796 --> 01:10:27.997]  And he goes, I know son, we heard about this a long time ago, now it's happening.
[01:10:28.277 --> 01:10:29.677]  I'm gonna go down to the city council.
[01:10:30.557 --> 01:10:32.178]  This is happening, I'm mentioning a real case.
[01:10:33.918 --> 01:10:34.438]  And the colonel,
[01:10:36.169 --> 01:10:43.395]  Overall, 10 tours in different wars, goes down and speaks to the council and says, they're preparing for martial law, it's treason war with us.
[01:10:43.735 --> 01:10:45.517]  And that's happening in towns everywhere.
[01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:51.001]  Generals, colonels, captains, majors are going in and talking to the police chief.
[01:10:51.401 --> 01:10:52.642]  They're taking the sheriff to dinner.
[01:10:53.543 --> 01:10:54.884]  And they're showing them all the documents.
[01:10:55.204 --> 01:10:57.166]  There's a discussion happening across the country.
[01:10:58.325 --> 01:11:07.007]  You've seen it out in Texas towns, major cities, where county commissioners, head judges have gone public saying they're training for gun confiscation and we're going to have to fight them.
[01:11:08.367 --> 01:11:16.789]  And the national media is like, what a crazy county judge calling the police chief in on television on Fox Local and saying we've got to prepare to fight gun confiscation.
[01:11:17.249 --> 01:11:20.990]  That person would be a traitor if they didn't say they were going to stand against that.
[01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:22.870]  That's normal!
[01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:25.511]  Thank God there's normal people left in this country!
[01:11:28.072 --> 01:11:33.536]  You should be running around like a chicken with your head cut off with what's happening.
[01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:51.407]  At county commissioners, at city council, on your local news, starting local groups, doing local newsletters, getting a local access show, doing a local YouTube, going and buying time on the local AM or FM station, getting some sponsors, you know, call it the warning hour or whatever, and that will build in your area.
[01:11:51.827 --> 01:11:53.829]  You don't have to save the world by yourself.
[01:11:55.202 --> 01:11:59.043]  You've got to simply engage the enemy with their own battle plan.
[01:11:59.404 --> 01:12:00.104]  It's treason!
[01:12:00.304 --> 01:12:00.984]  We have them!
[01:12:01.164 --> 01:12:03.045]  We caught them opening the drawbridge!
[01:12:03.325 --> 01:12:04.966]  We caught them letting the enemy in!
[01:12:05.706 --> 01:12:07.407]  We gotta call them out, though!
[01:12:08.827 --> 01:12:10.948]  If we just business as usual, it's over.
[01:12:12.789 --> 01:12:15.330]  So I want your take on the article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:16.830]  It's also on DrugsReport.com.
[01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:18.811]  Right-hand side, LinkedIn, red.
[01:12:21.352 --> 01:12:23.413]  Where they are openly
[01:12:24.218 --> 01:12:30.207]  Training to quote take on Americans who oppose socialist tyranny.
[01:12:30.227 --> 01:12:31.068]  That's a close quote.
[01:12:31.108 --> 01:12:33.352]  Free Americans against socialist tyranny.
[01:12:34.943 --> 01:12:38.245]  Who are going to speak out during martial law and gun confiscation.
[01:12:38.845 --> 01:12:44.709]  And so they're going to shut down our web accounts and websites, and they're preparing Northcom and Cyber Command to shut us off.
[01:12:44.989 --> 01:12:51.432]  This is a multi-hundred page document that is quote, only for the highest level trusted homeland security agents.
[01:12:51.893 --> 01:13:00.718]  Translated, those who come from despicable families, are despicable traitors, and who are bigger enemies than any Chinese or Russian infiltrator.
[01:13:01.946 --> 01:13:05.409]  I mean, I mean, these are bonafide spies, folks.
[01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:06.930]  Bonafide traitors.
[01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:09.211]  This is real.
[01:13:09.932 --> 01:13:13.614]  They shipped guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment, false flag, and got caught.
[01:13:13.654 --> 01:13:15.015]  CBS News, read the documents.
[01:13:16.156 --> 01:13:18.858]  They will blow up federal buildings to blame it on us.
[01:13:19.158 --> 01:13:20.900]  They will bomb D.C.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:21.520]  to blame it on us.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:25.343]  They will set off a nuke if we don't expose them.
[01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:28.724]  You understand, folks, this isn't a game.
[01:13:28.964 --> 01:13:31.925]  This isn't some crazy guy up on air ranting and raving.
[01:13:32.165 --> 01:13:35.586]  You're meant to rant and rave about things like this to get people moving.
[01:13:38.787 --> 01:13:41.388]  You ever seen a group of hunting dogs before you let them out of the back of a truck?
[01:13:42.128 --> 01:13:46.249]  They start getting excited and running in circles and snipping at each other, getting each other fired.
[01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:48.470]  Ever watch film of wolves or wild dogs in Africa?
[01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:54.572]  How they get up in the morning, they're kind of lazy, and one starts running in circles and yapping at the other, saying, hey, I'm hungry, get it up.
[01:13:55.882 --> 01:13:56.863]  Get up off the ground.
[01:13:57.343 --> 01:13:57.803]  Let's go.
[01:13:57.823 --> 01:14:00.405]  It's the same thing, folks.
[01:14:00.525 --> 01:14:02.526]  I am running around beating my chest at the camp.
[01:14:02.866 --> 01:14:06.909]  The enemy is massed on the hill right above us with their war fires.
[01:14:07.269 --> 01:14:11.171]  They just overrun 10 other villages that we got word of and killed everybody.
[01:14:12.232 --> 01:14:15.114]  We gotta get up and get our weapons together and get ready.
[01:14:16.055 --> 01:14:20.596]  Just like Paul Revere rode through the night saying to arms to arms, the British are coming, the Redcoats are coming.
[01:14:20.636 --> 01:14:21.976]  I'm not saying to arms to arms.
[01:14:21.996 --> 01:14:25.037]  90% of war, the Pentagon admits this is info war.
[01:14:25.397 --> 01:14:27.237]  You've got to smash the enemy with the truth.
[01:14:27.497 --> 01:14:30.398]  We've got weapons so much more deadly than the enemy.
[01:14:30.438 --> 01:14:34.879]  They've got lies, propaganda, deception, staged terror, false flags, frame-ups.
[01:14:35.159 --> 01:14:43.141]  We've got the Republic, free market, family, guns, our ancestors, our history, our birthright, everything.
[01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:44.541]  It's so good.
[01:14:45.635 --> 01:14:46.755]  It's prosperity!
[01:14:48.136 --> 01:14:52.657]  All we gotta do is run that flag up and say, hey, whatever happens, hell or high water, we're not moving.
[01:14:54.077 --> 01:15:05.261]  We're gonna speak out, we're gonna warn everybody, and then if you come and try to stage something to give yourself the moral high ground and try to round us up, we're gonna do what we have to.
[01:15:05.301 --> 01:15:06.281]  In fact, will you guys read me?
[01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:19.779]  Lexington Green, Lexington Green or Bunker Hill, I forget which one's the speech, where they got the preacher that's leading the militia and up marks the Redcoats to confiscate the guns, and he says, don't fire unless fired upon.
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:22.762]  But if they mean to have a war, they will have one.
[01:15:23.843 --> 01:15:24.743]  That's Lexington Green.
[01:15:25.424 --> 01:15:26.785]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[01:15:27.586 --> 01:15:31.609]  But the Redcoats might have won the war if they were more sophisticated, but they were moral people on average.
[01:15:32.668 --> 01:15:34.749]  Naval was the main group that would do stage stuff.
[01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:36.470]  That was such a more dirty profession.
[01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:38.291]  Much more dangerous, on average.
[01:15:39.291 --> 01:15:40.912]  False flags came out of naval activity.
[01:15:41.192 --> 01:15:44.313]  Going back to the Romans, there's some of the first dated ones of frame-ups.
[01:15:45.914 --> 01:15:49.116]  The British would not burn down a church and blame it on the militia.
[01:15:50.656 --> 01:15:55.538]  The British would not stage a terror attack and blame it on the militia to give them moral high ground to take the guns.
[01:15:56.779 --> 01:16:00.781]  They just marched up and said, you bastard colonialists, throw down your arms or you're dead.
[01:16:02.165 --> 01:16:04.326]  And then screamed out, one more time, we're gonna fire!
[01:16:05.526 --> 01:16:07.167]  And then you know the rest is history, folks.
[01:16:07.867 --> 01:16:09.387]  And that's what it all comes down to.
[01:16:11.148 --> 01:16:12.268]  Now here's the good news.
[01:16:12.408 --> 01:16:21.351]  I've told you the demographics in Spain, in France, in Germany, in Portugal, in Greece, in Canada, in the US, in England.
[01:16:22.352 --> 01:16:24.032]  UKIP's the fastest growing party in England.
[01:16:24.672 --> 01:16:25.873]  Fastest growing party in the EU.
[01:16:27.773 --> 01:16:31.355]  The problem is the EU is unelected at the top, so even though it's a parliament, it's ceremonial.
[01:16:32.295 --> 01:16:37.438]  That's what a naked tyranny the EU is, but Nigel Farage and others, the Ron Paul of Europe, are in there exposing it.
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:52.086]  But libertarianism, demographically, is about to become the global majority, as people just keep getting the same out of fake conservatives and fake liberals, because the globalists have bought off the interest at both levels.
[01:16:53.257 --> 01:16:59.160]  That's why you have Boehner and Obama meeting and it gets leaked with Biden about the Tea Party.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.902]  And the Republican Party is giving money to beat the Tea Party.
[01:17:02.102 --> 01:17:04.063]  And the Democrats are giving money to beat the Tea Party.
[01:17:04.303 --> 01:17:13.388]  Because the real Tea Party, not the one the neocons tried to take over, not the one they tried to bring in, not their counterfeit, but the real Libertarian Party is
[01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:28.977]  Decriminalization of drugs that liberals like, pro-sovereignty, not for open borders, anti-big welfare, anti-corporate welfare, anti-police state, pro-second amendment, pro-low taxes, pro-prosperity, pro-Americana.
[01:17:29.317 --> 01:17:31.159]  It's not right-wing, it's not left-wing, it's America!
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.643]  It is fusing people together and is sexy.
[01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:39.447]  In Hollywood, folks, I don't care if the people are black, white, Jewish, or Italian.
[01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:42.505]  I don't care if they're an Irish filmmaker or who they are.
[01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:47.149]  They listen to this show or other shows like it and are hot for liberty because we're not allowed to have it.
[01:17:49.462 --> 01:17:50.583]  I'm going to cover that in a moment.
[01:17:50.823 --> 01:18:03.556]  John Singleton, who's a great director and actor, says studios ain't letting black people tell stories, unveils Tupac biopic plans, says so-called liberals are trying to control black people.
[01:18:04.277 --> 01:18:06.999]  That's the term I coined, so-called liberals, 18 years ago.
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.201]  They're not liberals.
[01:18:08.261 --> 01:18:10.002]  I bet money on them, the barrelhead.
[01:18:10.863 --> 01:18:11.904]  Mr. Singleton's a listener.
[01:18:11.944 --> 01:18:13.326]  I want somebody to get a hold of him and get him on.
[01:18:15.083 --> 01:18:18.244]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, that's absolutely right.
[01:18:18.544 --> 01:18:20.565]  And I know, I've been there in meetings with directors.
[01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:24.386]  And all they want to talk about is the New World Order and how they're not allowed to talk about it.
[01:18:24.926 --> 01:18:31.028]  You think they like having to play games and have to deceive everybody and have to play along with the New World Order?
[01:18:31.048 --> 01:18:31.868]  You think people like that?
[01:18:32.168 --> 01:18:32.829]  They want freedom!
[01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:34.669]  Everybody wants freedom who's got red blood.
[01:18:35.309 --> 01:18:36.310]  And that's what unifies us.
[01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:39.931]  Here's the Financial Times of London on this line.
[01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:43.272]  It says, Republicans demographically
[01:18:44.321 --> 01:18:45.182]  are taking over
[01:19:03.203 --> 01:19:11.190]  Four whites, because they're branding it as white only, and if that conversion works, if we let the Democrats brand it as racial, which it isn't, that's why they're doing it, they will then win.
[01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:16.194]  We have to take over the Republican Party now, not let it commit suicide.
[01:19:16.674 --> 01:19:27.404]  It won't be perfect, but we need to support the libertarian constitutionalist, and then we can force the Democrats to come back more towards constitutionalism, not towards the right, more towards free market.
[01:19:27.944 --> 01:19:29.265]  And then we can save the country.
[01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:40.372]  But the Democrats, the Socialists, and the foreign banks want to fully wreck the country now forever, so they can reorganize it with a Marshall Plan, Cloward and Piven, just like they do in third world countries, or in Eastern Europe.
[01:19:41.473 --> 01:19:46.776]  Demographic and other factors are against the Grand Old Party, but its electoral hopes are high.
[01:19:47.076 --> 01:19:48.257]  And then it goes over the facts.
[01:19:49.197 --> 01:19:52.780]  This is one of the most important battles right now.
[01:19:54.053 --> 01:19:56.435]  And Obama has blown up in their face big time.
[01:19:56.635 --> 01:19:57.776]  Same thing's happening in France.
[01:19:57.836 --> 01:20:09.245]  I'm gonna tell you about that, then play the clip of the director Singleton about how the Democrats want to have the culture of black people be some pot-bellied guy talking in gangster voices, you know, beating his girlfriend.

[01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:46.293]  It's taken for granted that bottled water and even home filtered water is pure.
[01:20:46.654 --> 01:20:48.756]  But it is not the purest water you can drink.
[01:20:49.116 --> 01:20:51.378]  There is only one way to get the purest water.
[01:20:51.759 --> 01:20:54.962]  And that's with a new appliance that no healthy kitchen should be without.

[01:22:14.921 --> 01:22:16.743]  So, Dad, you're sounding a lot better.
[01:22:17.103 --> 01:22:18.925]  How have you been feeling since your heart attack?
[01:22:19.145 --> 01:22:21.368]  Well, son, I am feeling a lot better.
[01:22:21.648 --> 01:22:25.972]  Ever since your sister ordered me a bottle of HeartDrop 2000's Xtendivite for my heart.
[01:22:26.453 --> 01:22:27.013]  HeartDrop?
[01:22:27.134 --> 01:22:27.774]  Xtendivite?
[01:22:28.035 --> 01:22:28.475]  What's that?
[01:22:28.915 --> 01:22:33.580]  Well, it's just seven herbs that are approved for helping keep my heart healthy.
[01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:34.661]  That's great, Dad.
[01:22:35.002 --> 01:22:36.023]  I was getting worried about you.
[01:22:36.463 --> 01:22:37.463]  I am so glad it's helping.
[01:22:37.883 --> 01:22:38.604]  So am I, son.
[01:22:39.164 --> 01:22:41.084]  I'm very glad your sister got it for me.
[01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.765]  I wish I had known about it before my heart attack.
[01:22:44.085 --> 01:22:45.686]  Yeah, but would you have taken it, though?
[01:22:46.426 --> 01:22:47.927]  You know, I'm not sure if I would have.
[01:22:48.567 --> 01:22:50.407]  But I'm awful glad I'm taking it now.
[01:22:51.127 --> 01:22:52.228]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[01:22:52.248 --> 01:22:52.668]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[01:22:52.748 --> 01:22:54.308]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[01:23:04.127 --> 01:23:19.023]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:23:19.363 --> 01:23:21.185]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:23:21.365 --> 01:23:22.066]  Fluoride.
[01:23:22.266 --> 01:23:24.529]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:30.477]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:23:30.717 --> 01:23:35.483]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:23:35.624 --> 01:23:38.828]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[01:23:39.048 --> 01:23:41.649]  In areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:23:41.889 --> 01:23:44.029]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:23:44.289 --> 01:23:46.890]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:50.530]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:55.871]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[01:23:56.092 --> 01:24:00.853]  Infowarslife Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:24:01.153 --> 01:24:02.193]  I take it every day.
[01:24:02.353 --> 01:24:05.193]  That's Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:33.467]  I want to know your take on all the news I've been covering, specifically the fact that another Homeland Security document out about how to wage war against those that don't like, quote, socialist tyranny and martial law.
[01:24:33.947 --> 01:24:44.711]  Those documents, they don't want you to read or see all 160 plus pages that are highly restricted to trusted members of Homeland Security, trusted traders.
[01:24:45.964 --> 01:24:48.346]  They're up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:24:50.508 --> 01:24:52.230]  So now everybody else can see it in the government.
[01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:55.573]  See, our job is to decompartmentalize the larger master plan.
[01:24:56.534 --> 01:24:58.295]  And you know, just like clockwork, we've been doing it.
[01:24:58.355 --> 01:24:59.216]  We've been very accurate.
[01:25:02.059 --> 01:25:04.281]  And then it's your job, folks, to do something about it.
[01:25:07.263 --> 01:25:08.465]  The strange revival
[01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:10.825]  Of Republican America.
[01:25:11.446 --> 01:25:15.727]  Demographic and other factors are against the Grand Old Party, but its electoral hopes are high.
[01:25:15.807 --> 01:25:16.767]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:25:16.787 --> 01:25:16.827]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:16.847 --> 01:25:18.768]  First-time callers, I should throw in today.
[01:25:18.788 --> 01:25:19.588]  At least in this hour.
[01:25:19.608 --> 01:25:19.668]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:19.688 --> 01:25:22.709]  For years, people have predicted the Republican Party's demise.
[01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:24.049]  The decline of whites.
[01:25:24.069 --> 01:25:27.110]  See, they let the Democrats brand them as a white-only party when they'd been the white party.
[01:25:39.787 --> 01:25:41.509]  The decline of whites as a share of the U.S.
[01:25:41.549 --> 01:25:46.496]  population and the spread of tolerant values.
[01:25:46.536 --> 01:25:47.938]  Yes, like, give me all your bank account.
[01:25:49.139 --> 01:25:51.803]  Such a support for gay marriage would gradually snuff out its appeal.
[01:25:52.243 --> 01:25:54.726]  Yet the grand old party has a stubborn way of bouncing back.
[01:25:55.147 --> 01:25:57.850]  The coming midterm elections in November are unlikely to be an exception.
[01:25:58.843 --> 01:26:03.366]  Our Republican field for the next election looks stronger than any other time since 2000.
[01:26:03.806 --> 01:26:10.611]  Tomorrow may indeed arrive at some point, but for the time being, today is going pretty well for the Republicans.
[01:26:12.132 --> 01:26:18.196]  That's because you could run a ham sandwich or a dead dog up against the Democrats and it would win.
[01:26:19.847 --> 01:26:28.353]  If we had real leadership and libertarian ideas, and let the states decide all the gay marriage, business, and football issues, and abortion.
[01:26:28.973 --> 01:26:33.336]  And again, those are real issues, but they use it to pass it back and forth and divert from everything else.
[01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:35.797]  As Ron Paul says, that's a state issue.
[01:26:37.779 --> 01:26:40.821]  And the states are moving, of course, to ban abortion, because that's common sense.
[01:26:42.061 --> 01:26:45.724]  And you stop letting the Democrats, a bunch of kleptocratic scum, have the high ground.
[01:26:48.032 --> 01:26:50.293]  With their race-based politics.
[01:26:50.353 --> 01:26:53.955]  Now, shift gears to people that are about 20 years ahead of us when it comes to socialism.
[01:26:54.736 --> 01:26:55.256]  The Frenchies.
[01:26:55.936 --> 01:26:56.717]  Beautiful country.
[01:26:57.037 --> 01:26:57.737]  Great culture.
[01:26:58.097 --> 01:26:58.758]  Amazing art.
[01:26:59.298 --> 01:27:00.979]  Their suicide rate's the highest in Europe.
[01:27:00.999 --> 01:27:02.079]  They're an absolute joke.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:03.560]  Things are falling apart.
[01:27:04.301 --> 01:27:08.083]  French far-right triumphs in local polls that hammer ruling socialists.
[01:27:08.383 --> 01:27:10.044]  The socialists are exempt from taxes.
[01:27:10.304 --> 01:27:11.364]  They have Swiss bank accounts.
[01:27:11.444 --> 01:27:12.285]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[01:27:12.525 --> 01:27:16.167]  They have 100 plus percent tax on middle class to get rid of the middle class.
[01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:20.702]  Of course you're gonna have the 100% tax if the elite is exempt.
[01:27:22.284 --> 01:27:23.545]  They want all your money.
[01:27:26.688 --> 01:27:29.271]  They want to get rid of their competition.
[01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:33.956]  They want you poor, so you gotta get a government handout, which will mean they can social engineer you.
[01:27:35.258 --> 01:27:38.841]  So, every time there's local elections, the extreme right wing, that's about
[01:27:39.668 --> 01:27:41.389]  As conservative as somebody like John Boehner.
[01:27:41.850 --> 01:27:47.053]  I mean over there they call total communism, total end of the family is reasonable.
[01:27:47.773 --> 01:27:53.317]  Anyone that believes men should even be able to tie their shoelaces or be a father as total fascist right-wing evil.
[01:27:54.638 --> 01:27:55.999]  And that's how they control the debate.
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:58.941]  But more and more they're winning.
[01:28:00.797 --> 01:28:05.518]  in local elections because the country is being destroyed under the kleptocratic socialists.
[01:28:05.538 --> 01:28:06.338]  They're not even socialists.
[01:28:06.919 --> 01:28:14.920]  France's far-right National Front Party dealt a major blow to the ruling Socialists Sunday after several of its candidates took prime positions in the first round of local elections.
[01:28:15.381 --> 01:28:19.862]  The main center-right opposition UMP Party has hailed a big victory, as initial estimates showed.
[01:28:19.902 --> 01:28:25.083]  It came out in triumph in the elections as President Hollande suffers
[01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:30.593]  Record unpopularity against a backdrop of near zero growth and high unemployment.
[01:28:31.173 --> 01:28:38.418]  It doesn't matter because the French, many of them don't even know how to work now in the cities, and they've brought in foreigners who will vote for any amount of socialism for welfare.
[01:28:39.798 --> 01:28:43.160]  That's the socialist Cloward and Piven model, and it's worked quite nicely.
[01:28:43.321 --> 01:28:49.525]  Because they don't care if it wrecks the society, because the Rothschilds that run France are tax-exempt, along with the rest of the globalists.
[01:28:51.166 --> 01:28:51.666]  Very simple.
[01:28:52.964 --> 01:28:56.147]  Very, very simple, ladies and gentlemen, how this equation works.
[01:28:57.288 --> 01:29:10.521]  I mean, what they need is another de Gaulle there, who isn't left-wing or right-wing, but is a nationalist, to create French pride again, cut taxes massively, promote French having kids, and have some pride in yourselves and bring your country back.
[01:29:12.023 --> 01:29:14.305]  Watching the French commit suicide is disgusting.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:34.017]  And watching America adopt an anti-French stance, because British intelligence took us over completely in 1947, to have some ancient anti-French enmity when the French helped get this country started, just because the British aristocracy does when they're really French to begin with.
[01:29:34.538 --> 01:29:36.500]  Norman, that's Viking French.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:37.901]  The Vikings conquered France.
[01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:40.784]  So the Norman are a Viking French derivative.
[01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:43.522]  I'm Alsatian, part Alsatian.
[01:29:43.562 --> 01:29:46.764]  I mean, you know, the whole point is it's ridiculous to be anti-French.
[01:29:47.084 --> 01:29:49.505]  But French, find your life force again.
[01:29:49.645 --> 01:29:50.106]  Get up.
[01:29:50.646 --> 01:29:51.887]  Don't commit suicide.
[01:29:51.967 --> 01:29:53.327]  Kick the socialist scum out.
[01:29:53.848 --> 01:29:55.128]  Get rid of the French Revolution.
[01:29:55.328 --> 01:29:57.049]  Bring in a real revolution of family.
[01:29:57.309 --> 01:29:57.830]  We'll be back.
[01:29:58.850 --> 01:29:59.751]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.251 --> 01:30:01.852]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.772 --> 01:30:05.474]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:18.909]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:30:18.989 --> 01:30:27.093]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:30:27.393 --> 01:30:32.095]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:30:32.255 --> 01:30:38.998]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:39.058 --> 01:30:46.140]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:53.083]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:30:53.243 --> 01:30:57.605]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:30:57.726 --> 01:31:00.987]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[01:31:07.411 --> 01:31:09.652]  Available at Infowarslife.com.

[01:31:49.252 --> 01:32:00.496]  Herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:32:00.817 --> 01:32:06.139]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:10.401]  The facts are in.
[01:32:10.601 --> 01:32:11.723]  The studies are legion.
[01:32:12.003 --> 01:32:19.332]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:32:19.512 --> 01:32:22.976]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:32:23.356 --> 01:32:23.757]  Simple.
[01:32:23.917 --> 01:32:28.262]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:32:28.622 --> 01:32:34.087]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:50.403]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:32:50.683 --> 01:32:52.525]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:32:52.665 --> 01:32:55.947]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:32:55.967 --> 01:32:58.428]  Can you believe these are actually at Walmart's?
[01:33:22.312 --> 01:33:25.094]  They actually have that witch at Walmart speaking on telescreens.
[01:33:25.494 --> 01:33:26.034]  In America!
[01:33:26.054 --> 01:33:35.660]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scoring particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:39.142]  To recap those revisions, women
[01:33:40.447 --> 01:33:44.048]  ...are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets.
[01:33:44.749 --> 01:33:53.312]  But teenagers now rack up 40 points, and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[01:33:53.512 --> 01:34:02.375]  The big score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old, has been upped to 100 points.
[01:34:03.476 --> 01:34:08.958]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[01:34:13.573 --> 01:34:17.035]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:17.655 --> 01:34:19.376]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:24.958 --> 01:34:31.421]  I am so honored to be here broadcasting worldwide and got the crew bringing us in.
[01:34:35.558 --> 01:34:38.581]  I'm not name-dropping, I just know I've been told this and sent video of it.
[01:34:38.921 --> 01:34:45.106]  For like six, seven years, sometimes Motley Crue will play videos at their concerts and it's clips of some of my films.
[01:34:45.947 --> 01:34:49.190]  And I know Megadeth does that, which I'm always flattered by.
[01:34:51.451 --> 01:35:02.561]  And Buckley, I didn't even know, has hung out with and knows and worked on graphics with one of the guys in Motley Crue, my cousin.
[01:35:04.566 --> 01:35:08.269]  And so maybe he'll get us through in a contact to get one of those guys on to hear their politics.
[01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:11.031]  Crank it up for him, just a moment.
[01:35:12.051 --> 01:35:19.677]  See, freedom is popular.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:27.962]  Take a chance with me to butcher the words, doubly.
[01:35:28.803 --> 01:35:30.764]  Alright folks, we are back live here.
[01:35:30.804 --> 01:35:31.725]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:35:33.519 --> 01:35:34.780]  I'm on the prowl tonight!
[01:35:35.361 --> 01:35:59.000]  We've got your calls coming up and we've also, of course, I just came in with John Bowne's intro that he put together from Death Race 2000 because we were showing in the video of your radio listener actual Homeland Security articles where they train to take on school kids and kill them, women, old people, any gun owner to be killed with their no hesitation targets.
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:01.582]  So don't forget any of that.
[01:36:02.142 --> 01:36:05.084]  I apologize coming in with the intros and playing a minute or so of the music.
[01:36:05.144 --> 01:36:08.227]  It's just hard to, hard to turn that type of stuff off for me.
[01:36:08.247 --> 01:36:11.830]  I know it's music to some of your ears and not to some other folks.
[01:36:12.150 --> 01:36:15.813]  You know what we need more of is Hank Williams on the show.
[01:36:17.074 --> 01:36:25.400]  Lost Highway, Colligia, um, Move Over Little Dog, New Dog, or Fat Dog's moving in.
[01:36:26.681 --> 01:36:28.323]  Hey Good Lookin', what you got cookin'?
[01:36:29.977 --> 01:36:31.038]  I was listening to that last night.
[01:36:31.078 --> 01:36:32.699]  That just touches the soul.
[01:36:32.719 --> 01:36:35.561]  I was actually watching old TV stuff of him, like in the 40s.
[01:36:36.362 --> 01:36:39.324]  Hey, good looking, what you got cooking?
[01:36:39.664 --> 01:36:42.746]  How's about cooking something up for me?
[01:36:42.766 --> 01:36:45.988]  We're gonna make us a brand new recipe.
[01:36:47.389 --> 01:36:48.971]  Yeah, I got two dollars.
[01:36:48.991 --> 01:36:58.798]  There's a place over the hill that's got, what's he say, that's got soda pop and you can dance for free.
[01:37:00.086 --> 01:37:07.753]  In fact, I gotta go out now, since I said it, with, um... Hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'?
[01:37:08.614 --> 01:37:09.775]  I need a vacation, folks.
[01:37:10.416 --> 01:37:11.957]  I really do think I do need a vacation.
[01:37:11.977 --> 01:37:14.640]  So I can just go listen to Hank Williams Jr.
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:15.420]  on the beach somewhere.
[01:37:16.321 --> 01:37:17.322]  And Hank Williams, of course.
[01:37:18.263 --> 01:37:19.724]  I like Hank Williams better than Hank Williams Jr.
[01:37:22.059 --> 01:37:23.120]  That's another side issue.
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:32.811]  See what happens is I cover all this news myself and it gets a little traumatic for me and then I come back and I kind of digress off into having some fun because it is so incredibly serious.
[01:37:34.192 --> 01:37:36.152]  Here's some of the Russian news, and we're going to your phone calls.
[01:37:36.272 --> 01:37:41.333]  Russia uses 1999 NATO bombing in media war over Crimea.
[01:37:41.813 --> 01:37:59.196]  Reuters, Russian television, blasted viewers with 15-year-old footage of NATO bombing raids, burning buildings, and wounding people in Yugoslavia as they handed Kosovo over to Al-Qaeda on Monday to step up a media campaign against the West over the Crimea crisis as they pump more troops into Crimea.
[01:38:00.356 --> 01:38:03.197]  And as NATO continues to saber-rattle for war.
[01:38:04.164 --> 01:38:06.785]  Continuing, Ukraine fears Russia ready to attack.
[01:38:08.225 --> 01:38:12.126]  Ukrainian Air Force commander abducted by pro-Russian forces.
[01:38:12.206 --> 01:38:13.506]  That's out of CBS News.
[01:38:14.026 --> 01:38:18.327]  Ukraine orders Crimean troop withdrawal as Russia seizes naval base.
[01:38:18.947 --> 01:38:20.828]  That was part of a deal to take over their bases.
[01:38:20.848 --> 01:38:22.408]  They act like it's a war going on.
[01:38:22.708 --> 01:38:26.949]  They did physically attack a base where the army did not pull out where they were supposed to.
[01:38:26.989 --> 01:38:28.449]  The Russians did, as you know, yesterday.
[01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:30.270]  NATO General warns
[01:38:31.090 --> 01:38:32.631]  ...of further Russian aggression.
[01:38:33.331 --> 01:38:33.591]  U.S.
[01:38:33.611 --> 01:38:47.258]  and Ukrainian officials warned Sunday that Russia may be poised to expand its territorial conquest into eastern Ukraine and beyond, with senior NATO officials saying Moscow might even order its troops to cross Ukraine to reach Moldovia.
[01:38:48.659 --> 01:38:53.542]  The warnings came as Russia was finalizing its takeover of Ukrainian military bases in Crimea.
[01:38:53.942 --> 01:38:55.182]  The peninsula is occupied.
[01:38:55.202 --> 01:38:58.224]  At the start of March, it's subsequently annexed, and they voted to do it.
[01:39:00.515 --> 01:39:03.238]  So, here's another one.
[01:39:04.619 --> 01:39:12.448]  Afghanistan supports Russia's Crimea takeover, welcomes Moscow back into country.
[01:39:15.777 --> 01:39:16.517]  As the U.S.
[01:39:16.557 --> 01:39:21.840]  military prepares to leave Afghanistan in nearly 13 years of the conflict, they've just called them contractors now, folks.
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:22.420]  They're not leaving.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.601]  With Taliban, three visiting U.S.
[01:39:24.641 --> 01:39:34.045]  congressmen had to endure a statement from Afghan President, who they installed, Hamid Karzai, that was released while they were in Kabul.
[01:39:35.399 --> 01:39:45.607]  Citing the free will of the Crimean people, Karzai's office said, with respect to the decision of the people of Crimea, took through a recent referendum that considers Crimea as part of the Russian Federation.
[01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:49.610]  To date, only Syria and Venezuela have taken a similar position.
[01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:53.853]  Well, Karzai's been double-crossed.
[01:39:53.873 --> 01:39:57.396]  They clearly blew up his brother, the main heroin dealer, a few years ago.
[01:39:57.436 --> 01:39:58.577]  That made him mad, and he said that.
[01:39:59.097 --> 01:40:00.098]  So he came out and he said, look,
[01:40:00.805 --> 01:40:01.285]  The U.S.
[01:40:01.325 --> 01:40:02.726]  government really runs Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:03.026 --> 01:40:05.007]  They staged the whole deal for opium supply.
[01:40:05.827 --> 01:40:08.588]  And there's a world government battle going on and we want them out.
[01:40:09.689 --> 01:40:12.450]  And it's not that I just believe Mohammed Karzai.
[01:40:12.490 --> 01:40:13.891]  Remember he said that last year?
[01:40:14.251 --> 01:40:16.632]  That guy's type in Karzai says West behind bombings.
[01:40:18.833 --> 01:40:19.693]  And behind Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:20.254 --> 01:40:21.694]  Well of course they're behind Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:21.754 --> 01:40:22.595]  They're behind them all over.
[01:40:22.735 --> 01:40:23.975]  They've always been behind Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:25.636 --> 01:40:27.397]  That's how they keep all the Muslims in line.
[01:40:27.757 --> 01:40:28.457]  And us in line.
[01:40:28.857 --> 01:40:30.278]  Oh we gotta take your rights Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:32.222 --> 01:40:33.563]  So that's some of the news on that front.
[01:40:33.583 --> 01:40:38.185]  Let me get one more story on the First Amendment issue, then we're going to go right to your calls well into the next hour.
[01:40:38.505 --> 01:40:42.947]  Then I've got a bunch of special reports and a mass of other news that's breaking as we speak.
[01:40:44.748 --> 01:40:52.851]  Now, one of the big stories I wanted to get to here is the fact that I've talked a lot about how Hollywood isn't Republican, they're not Democrat.
[01:40:53.332 --> 01:40:54.172]  They don't like either one.
[01:40:54.512 --> 01:40:56.293]  They're sick of those two choices of ice cream.
[01:40:57.765 --> 01:41:08.881]  One's kind of a fascist old-line tyranny, the other's a fast-growing cancer of total socialism, anti-family, who want to ban the word bossy and control everything you do and reduce the world's population.
[01:41:10.103 --> 01:41:13.768]  The Democrats are the cutting edge of the globalist social engineering takeover.
[01:41:15.666 --> 01:41:25.574]  So, John Singleton, echoing what we've heard from many others, top director says studios ain't letting black people tell stories, unveils Tupac biopic plans.
[01:41:26.214 --> 01:41:30.998]  As part of the Hollywood Masters interview series, the director criticizes so-called liberals.
[01:41:31.038 --> 01:41:31.578]  That's a quote.
[01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:34.800]  You know, I'm the guy that coined the term so-called liberals.
[01:41:35.181 --> 01:41:35.921]  I'm just telling you.
[01:41:35.941 --> 01:41:37.122]  I've been hearing that for 18 years.
[01:41:38.383 --> 01:41:47.449]  In the studio and ads, you've got a lot of black executives at the studio who are afraid to give their opinion about what black culture is.
[01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:54.953]  And who's the big actors on the Homeland Security Show that Mankell had on his show?
[01:41:55.854 --> 01:41:59.456]  Yeah, Lennox, who said, look, look, it's all socialism to take over and destroy America.
[01:41:59.856 --> 01:42:03.919]  Obama was, you know, basically, you know, I was hired to teach him how to act like a president.
[01:42:04.139 --> 01:42:05.560]  That's why he sounds just like me.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:06.880]  That's why they want me to play him.
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:07.601]  I won't do it.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:16.884]  I mean, quite frankly, I almost run into no black people that I know that love socialism and turning their guns in and hate the family and all the stuff.
[01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:21.526]  It is absolutely a force-fed, mind-control operation.
[01:42:22.107 --> 01:42:22.927]  Now, there it is, report.
[01:42:23.027 --> 01:42:24.928]  Obama is an actor trained by Harry Lennox.
[01:42:26.569 --> 01:42:27.709]  By the way, he called Mancow.
[01:42:27.729 --> 01:42:29.450]  He said Hollywood went crazy.
[01:42:29.490 --> 01:42:31.571]  And folks, I don't just know Charlie Sheen.
[01:42:32.572 --> 01:42:33.852]  I don't just know the Gibsons.
[01:42:33.912 --> 01:42:34.573]  I don't just know...
[01:42:36.238 --> 01:42:36.658]  You name it.
[01:42:37.879 --> 01:42:42.882]  Back when I used to go out to Hollywood and be on TV shows out there, I just say no now.
[01:42:42.922 --> 01:42:43.962]  Nothing ever gets done out of it.
[01:42:44.423 --> 01:42:46.404]  Come to Jesse Ventura's birthday party.
[01:42:46.784 --> 01:42:47.684]  Meet a bunch of Hollywood people.
[01:42:48.345 --> 01:42:48.685]  Go to this.
[01:42:48.745 --> 01:42:50.246]  I haven't been to LA in a couple years.
[01:42:51.466 --> 01:42:53.107]  Joe Rogan wants me to come out there and be on his podcast.
[01:42:53.127 --> 01:42:54.308]  He's a good friend of mine since 1998.
[01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:54.928]  Haven't been going out.
[01:42:56.926 --> 01:42:57.767]  I probably need to, though.
[01:42:57.787 --> 01:42:58.908]  He's come on my show so many times.
[01:42:58.948 --> 01:43:00.729]  He's kind of like, I'm not coming on your show, you come on mine.
[01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:03.171]  And I think that's kind of fair.
[01:43:03.191 --> 01:43:07.214]  But the point is, is that I just get sick when I'm out there.
[01:43:07.254 --> 01:43:08.555]  It's the smog, whatever it is.
[01:43:08.816 --> 01:43:09.376]  I feel weak.
[01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:11.258]  It's like kryptonite when I go out there.
[01:43:11.278 --> 01:43:12.098]  Like I'm Superman.
[01:43:12.399 --> 01:43:12.959]  I feel great.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.021]  I feel great in New York, London.
[01:43:15.041 --> 01:43:16.142]  It's not a big city effect.
[01:43:16.462 --> 01:43:21.486]  I go to L.A., I literally feel like my soul's being sucked out.
[01:43:21.526 --> 01:43:22.327]  It's more than physical.
[01:43:23.143 --> 01:43:24.504]  As I'm flying in, I feel it.
[01:43:25.104 --> 01:43:26.744]  I think Satan must be there or something.
[01:43:26.824 --> 01:43:31.026]  I don't know, folks, but I just cannot even enter the area.
[01:43:31.106 --> 01:43:32.347]  San Francisco, I don't get L.N.
[01:43:33.167 --> 01:43:34.147]  Like, I like San Francisco.
[01:43:34.187 --> 01:43:35.688]  It's got a weird, creepy vibe to it.
[01:43:35.708 --> 01:43:38.349]  At the bottom, it's still a beautiful place and has a lot of good vibes to it.
[01:43:38.929 --> 01:43:39.149]  L.A.
[01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:40.330]  brings me to my knees, folks.
[01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:43.651]  I mean, literally, torture would be being incarcerated there.
[01:43:43.671 --> 01:43:44.571]  I shouldn't put up my fears.
[01:43:44.971 --> 01:43:48.473]  The point is, is that I have been
[01:43:50.114 --> 01:43:50.995]  Let's not exaggerate.
[01:43:51.035 --> 01:43:53.136]  Probably 20 A-list parties over the years.
[01:43:53.256 --> 01:43:56.659]  I mean, places where there's 20, 30 people in there.
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:43:58.300]  Okay?
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:06.866]  And then I've been at probably 20, 30 or more dinners where there's top, you know, producers, directors, you know, top lawyers there.
[01:44:07.687 --> 01:44:11.069]  And all they talk about is the tyranny of the studio heads.
[01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:12.891]  And these are people right below the studio heads.
[01:44:14.955 --> 01:44:19.637]  And, you know, I've told the stories about Mark Cuban and stuff getting threatened by the White House, and I couldn't talk about it.
[01:44:19.957 --> 01:44:21.678]  I mentioned it happened, but I couldn't tell the whole story.
[01:44:21.918 --> 01:44:23.258]  Later it all came out in the New York Times.
[01:44:24.059 --> 01:44:40.745]  They are on a very short leash, folks, and they tell you, you're going to make what's cool a giant, fat, black guy calling women names and running around waving guns around so that young black people will pick that up and the police have been trained to put them in jail.
[01:44:40.765 --> 01:44:42.586]  I mean, it's that simple.
[01:44:43.524 --> 01:44:45.805]  Because you look like a criminal thug, I mean, the cops are coming after you.
[01:44:47.505 --> 01:44:48.085]  It's the same thing.
[01:44:48.125 --> 01:44:54.888]  We're going to teach young kids how to be, you know, all in black, cutting themselves, hating life, hating humanity, so they have no life force and die.
[01:44:55.388 --> 01:44:56.808]  We're going to force-feed Marilyn Manson.
[01:44:57.608 --> 01:45:00.609]  I mean, these are literally manufactured by Sumner Redstone.
[01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:08.392]  I've been in multiple meetings with people who've been there when the, quote, mercurial Sumner Redstone is literally, you know,
[01:45:09.653 --> 01:45:14.115]  This is a guy who hung from a building while the fire was shooting out for over an hour.
[01:45:14.195 --> 01:45:14.835]  I mean, he's tough.
[01:45:15.295 --> 01:45:16.936]  He was 80-something then, he's 90-something now.
[01:45:17.276 --> 01:45:18.657]  Total demon goblin, okay?
[01:45:19.537 --> 01:45:23.659]  And the point is, but a will to dominate and destroy the soul of America.
[01:45:24.399 --> 01:45:26.180]  And a bunch of other people up there in Hollywood.
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:31.422]  And I've been there with all these big directors, man, and they are all under the control of the New World Order.
[01:45:32.345 --> 01:45:37.430]  And it is so frustrating that the American people have no idea.
[01:45:37.730 --> 01:45:39.351]  We've already won, folks.
[01:45:40.673 --> 01:45:41.493]  We've already won.
[01:45:43.355 --> 01:45:44.436]  But they're all afraid.
[01:45:46.237 --> 01:45:51.262]  What, Mike Judge isn't afraid to come on the show and say there's tyranny in Hollywood and you better watch it when he says it'll come after him.
[01:45:54.110 --> 01:45:55.611]  I mean, who else is willing to speak out?
[01:45:55.691 --> 01:45:56.412]  Billy Corrigan?
[01:45:56.792 --> 01:45:57.572]  Dave Mustaine?
[01:45:58.973 --> 01:45:59.954]  Someone like Mike Judge?
[01:45:59.994 --> 01:46:08.039]  I've had a bunch of other actors and people on, but I mean, we're talking about the biggest actors in this country, the biggest directors in this country.
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:12.082]  Our listeners of this show hate the New World Order and are awake.
[01:46:15.144 --> 01:46:16.885]  But they don't want the system coming after them.
[01:46:20.814 --> 01:46:22.876]  Well, we're going to lose everything if you don't start going public.
[01:46:23.116 --> 01:46:24.136]  Now, I don't know this guy.
[01:46:24.757 --> 01:46:26.218]  I know of his movies and know who he is.
[01:46:27.259 --> 01:46:28.940]  John Singleton's made some really good movies.
[01:46:29.741 --> 01:46:34.024]  And, you know, he says it's a bunch of fake liberals trying to totally control what black people can and can't.
[01:46:34.144 --> 01:46:40.909]  And he's nice and says, you know, these are some fun movies, they're okay, but, you know, we have to do what we're told and only put out one type of culture.
[01:46:45.472 --> 01:46:47.854]  So let's play a clip of that interview and then go to your phone calls.
[01:46:50.342 --> 01:46:52.564]  Yeah, because they want black people to be what they want to be.
[01:46:52.764 --> 01:46:55.627]  And nobody is man enough to go and say that.
[01:46:55.727 --> 01:46:59.531]  They want black people to be who they want to be, as opposed to what they are.
[01:46:59.551 --> 01:46:59.991]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:00.011 --> 01:47:04.816]  Like, the black films now, so-called black films now, they're great.
[01:47:04.976 --> 01:47:05.557]  They're great films.
[01:47:05.697 --> 01:47:06.598]  But they're just product.
[01:47:06.998 --> 01:47:10.522]  They're not moving the bar forward creatively or anything.
[01:47:10.862 --> 01:47:11.282]  It's not like...
[01:47:11.963 --> 01:47:15.505]  You know, it's not that you have to say something or you have to make an important movie.
[01:47:15.865 --> 01:47:17.305]  We're in the entertainment business.
[01:47:17.345 --> 01:47:23.628]  We're in the business where we've got as many butts in the seats and get people excited on Friday, Saturday, and even come out Sunday to see the picture.
[01:47:24.088 --> 01:47:28.730]  And even after that, they've got to want to buy it, they've got to want to, like, you know, order it, push a button, get it.
[01:47:29.451 --> 01:47:32.992]  But you don't do that unless you can pull someone's emotions in.
[01:47:33.212 --> 01:47:36.994]  Unless you get really specifically, unless you're specific culturally,
[01:47:38.226 --> 01:47:38.666]  To the point
[01:47:58.731 --> 01:48:02.073]  If I got as universal as possible, it would cross over.
[01:48:03.013 --> 01:48:04.634]  And I still hold to that kind of thing.
[01:48:04.654 --> 01:48:05.734]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:48:06.155 --> 01:48:12.038]  Francis Ford Coppola was the right person to do The Godfather, because he had an Italian-American background.
[01:48:12.418 --> 01:48:20.522]  Woody Allen, his early pictures that were basically his Upper East Side, nebbish Jewish guy.
[01:48:20.582 --> 01:48:24.044]  Unless you're from that environment, you couldn't really totally appreciate those pictures.
[01:48:24.924 --> 01:48:34.668]  Basically, what it is, is a feedback loop, where they take one stereotype, and then push that, and then people pick up on that, and it stagnates culture.
[01:48:36.529 --> 01:48:39.390]  Well, what's the stereotype in the cartoons, the movies, the dramas?
[01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:42.732]  Gun-owning white men are terrorists who molest children.
[01:48:45.893 --> 01:48:46.753]  What about that message?
[01:48:47.113 --> 01:48:53.256]  But see, whites won't boycott, whites won't get upset when they're being demonized, so you're fair game.
[01:48:55.776 --> 01:49:04.162]  We're going to go to break and come back and talk to Venom, Allum, Jeff, Joey, and many others that are patiently holding first-time callers 800-259-9231.
[01:49:04.182 --> 01:49:04.482]  800-259-9231.
[01:49:05.303 --> 01:49:14.629]  I've done an hour and 49 minutes of radio here and haven't plugged anything yet.
[01:49:14.969 --> 01:49:20.914]  Folks, we carry the very best products out there, bar none, whether it's the Pro-Pure
[01:49:22.276 --> 01:49:28.605]  G2 systems that cut out the glyphosates, the fluoride, all of it, that blow away the competition are the same price or lower priced.
[01:49:28.966 --> 01:49:32.491]  Promo code WATER gets you 10% off, breaking any price out there.
[01:49:32.531 --> 01:49:33.392]  The full selection.
[01:49:34.682 --> 01:49:40.945]  InfoWarsStore.com and we've got other filtration systems as well that are even less expensive but aren't as good.
[01:49:40.966 --> 01:49:43.447]  And I've got the LifeStraw, the ultimate survival straw.
[01:49:44.107 --> 01:50:01.577]  InfoWarsStore.com and by shopping with the good guys, by purchasing products at InfoWarsStore.com, you're voting with your dollars through free association to fund a hardcore dedicated media operation with filmmaking, magazines, the news articles, the nightly news, everything we do.
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:07.585]  Building an organization to really be able to expose the globalist.
[01:50:07.905 --> 01:50:15.794]  Then there's Infowarslife.com where you can find the fluoride shield, the nascent iodine, and five other compounds that detoxify like nothing else.
[01:50:16.095 --> 01:50:17.556]  The purified proprietary
[01:50:18.928 --> 01:50:21.010]  Nation Iodine Survival Shield.
[01:50:21.811 --> 01:50:22.592]  That's available.
[01:50:23.112 --> 01:50:25.435]  And again, no one else has this type of iodine, folks.
[01:50:25.475 --> 01:50:26.936]  It's double the strength, proprietary.
[01:50:27.176 --> 01:50:30.279]  Turns blue on paper, electric blue, not black or red.
[01:50:30.299 --> 01:50:32.542]  That just gives you an example of how special it is.
[01:50:32.902 --> 01:50:34.804]  Now we have a new product, Silver Bullet.
[01:50:35.164 --> 01:50:37.827]  The strongest nano-sized silver.
[01:50:38.247 --> 01:50:40.470]  Took us six months to finally get a lab that could do it.
[01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:41.290]  Prestigious lab.
[01:50:42.356 --> 01:50:43.337]  Silver bullet.
[01:50:43.457 --> 01:50:44.697]  Now, you don't take this regularly.
[01:50:44.737 --> 01:50:45.678]  This is an antibiotic.
[01:50:46.198 --> 01:50:47.038]  Internal, external.
[01:50:47.158 --> 01:50:48.019]  Consult your physician.
[01:50:48.399 --> 01:50:50.080]  Because this is strong stuff.
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:50.860]  This is not a game.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.101]  Wait until you see what comes out of it.
[01:50:53.121 --> 01:50:53.661]  I mean, it's strong.
[01:50:54.482 --> 01:50:55.922]  It's gold colored.
[01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:56.603]  It's not clear.
[01:50:57.183 --> 01:50:57.603]  It's strong.
[01:50:58.244 --> 01:51:01.025]  So, that's available at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:51:01.045 --> 01:51:02.085]  They can answer all your questions.
[01:51:02.105 --> 01:51:02.165]  888-253-3139.
[01:51:02.285 --> 01:51:03.366]  Thanks for your support.
[01:51:09.989 --> 01:51:19.257]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:51:19.297 --> 01:51:20.037]  This capitalism?
[01:51:20.077 --> 01:51:26.202]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:51:26.262 --> 01:51:29.905]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:51:29.945 --> 01:51:30.886]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:51:30.906 --> 01:51:31.927]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:51:31.947 --> 01:51:32.227]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:32.287 --> 01:51:32.627]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:45.775]  Uncover a simple privacy loophole that can stop the NSA spying thugs in their tracks at PrivacyLockdown.com.
[01:51:45.995 --> 01:51:51.377]  The NSA has already shut down hundreds of sites and to truth be told they could shut down this operation at any time.
[01:51:51.698 --> 01:51:57.600]  See, the privacy loophole I'm about to show you allows you to make all your sensitive information disappear in the next 30 days or less.
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:06.303]  Go to PrivacyLockdown.com now to take your life off the grid and see the loophole in the NSA and FBI spying machine before they close the loophole forever.
[01:52:06.783 --> 01:52:08.004]  Go to PrivacyLockdown.com.
[01:52:09.324 --> 01:52:10.165]  The facts are in.
[01:52:10.345 --> 01:52:11.467]  The studies are legion.
[01:52:11.727 --> 01:52:19.036]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:52:19.216 --> 01:52:22.660]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:23.441]  Simple.
[01:52:23.601 --> 01:52:27.906]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:52:28.266 --> 01:52:33.708]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:52:33.928 --> 01:52:39.250]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:49.854]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:52:50.174 --> 01:52:54.356]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:52:54.696 --> 01:52:56.537]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:52:56.857 --> 01:53:02.120]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:06.582]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:53:06.742 --> 01:53:08.023]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:53:10.137 --> 01:53:11.717]  Time and time again.
[01:53:11.737 --> 01:53:14.578]  You need to come here and help us.
[01:53:14.658 --> 01:53:15.759]  We need assistance.
[01:53:16.119 --> 01:53:16.659]  Please!
[01:53:16.939 --> 01:53:20.240]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:26.602]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[01:53:27.242 --> 01:53:29.224]  We are hurting down here and we need help.
[01:53:55.685 --> 01:53:56.586]  Immediately.
[01:53:56.626 --> 01:54:01.009]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[01:54:01.369 --> 01:54:03.731]  MyPatriotSupply.com.
[01:54:04.111 --> 01:54:06.492]  MyPatriotSupply.com.
[01:54:13.537 --> 01:54:15.518]  By the way, folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:54:15.538 --> 01:54:18.280]  I want to be clear, I'm not bragging that I've been to some Hollywood parties.
[01:54:18.661 --> 01:54:19.401]  Oh, I'm so cool.
[01:54:19.461 --> 01:54:20.502]  I'm saying I absolutely hate it.
[01:54:23.781 --> 01:54:26.362]  I'm telling you, though, most people there are awake, actually.
[01:54:26.962 --> 01:54:30.923]  But they're under the control of just the studio heads and the media heads.
[01:54:31.663 --> 01:54:36.185]  So the revolution of liberty is very strong, and the system's worried about it.
[01:54:36.205 --> 01:54:39.886]  That's why Homeland Security targets the libertarians and the, quote, conspiracy theorists.
[01:54:40.306 --> 01:54:46.528]  That just means a heretic who questions the matrix, the grand architect of the matrix, Lucifer.
[01:54:47.248 --> 01:54:50.069]  We're people that don't just buy what mainstream media vomits out.
[01:54:50.409 --> 01:54:52.450]  We don't just repeat it, like mother's milk.
[01:54:53.871 --> 01:54:55.491]  We don't trust it, for good reason.
[01:54:56.932 --> 01:55:04.673]  And so there's a huge awakening happening, and that's why they want to bring in total tyranny, because the system can see it's not going to be able to suppress things forever.
[01:55:05.654 --> 01:55:06.514]  So be yourself.
[01:55:08.114 --> 01:55:10.255]  Liberalism is not even what the Democrats are.
[01:55:10.335 --> 01:55:11.275]  They're a bunch of tyrants.
[01:55:11.855 --> 01:55:13.995]  But they intimidate most of the so-called liberals?
[01:55:14.756 --> 01:55:15.716]  Really aren't even liberals.
[01:55:15.736 --> 01:55:21.077]  They've got guns, yeah, they drink raw milk, yeah, they're for animal rights, but they've got guns and they don't really like abortion.
[01:55:26.095 --> 01:55:30.737]  But the media chooses to only cover what they say when it's a talking point to give them coverage.
[01:55:30.757 --> 01:55:32.677]  They're told what to go out and say to the media.
[01:55:33.017 --> 01:55:34.878]  They're used to create the illusion.
[01:55:35.638 --> 01:55:36.479]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:55:36.759 --> 01:55:38.039]  And that illusion's coming down.
[01:55:38.459 --> 01:55:43.801]  And the only thing holding it up is our will to speak out and things like the Republican leadership that are a bunch of scum.
[01:55:44.801 --> 01:55:46.602]  They're there sharing power with the Democrats.
[01:55:46.642 --> 01:55:48.823]  The Democrats aren't going to share power with the leadership of that.
[01:55:49.843 --> 01:55:51.964]  The people are looking for a way to get freedom back.
[01:55:53.018 --> 01:55:55.920]  But it needs to happen to the two parties because they've got a monopoly right now.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:59.843]  And we need to kick the Republican bluebloods out or there's no future!
[01:56:03.385 --> 01:56:04.886]  Venom in FEMA Region 3.
[01:56:05.686 --> 01:56:08.328]  What former state are you in FEMA Region 3, Venom?
[01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:10.450]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[01:56:10.710 --> 01:56:11.490]  Yes, Venom.
[01:56:11.850 --> 01:56:13.652]  What area are you in, Venom?
[01:56:14.632 --> 01:56:16.033]  I'm in Virginia, Alex.
[01:56:16.514 --> 01:56:17.074]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:56:18.295 --> 01:56:21.177]  I have a couple questions, but first I want to start off.
[01:56:22.222 --> 01:56:23.663]  I really appreciate your show.
[01:56:24.103 --> 01:56:25.945]  Um, I've been spreading the word with you guys.
[01:56:26.325 --> 01:56:30.108]  Um, I've been awake since, uh, September 11th, which is my birthday.
[01:56:30.128 --> 01:56:35.692]  Um, I had lost a close family member and the first tower that fell.
[01:56:36.233 --> 01:56:38.875]  And ever since then, you know, I've been, you know, pretty much woke up.
[01:56:39.635 --> 01:56:50.724]  Um, first of all, if I'd like to start about the censorship thing that's going on on the internet, um, I've been sharing some of you guys' stuff on my page and here recently, about two days ago,
[01:56:51.545 --> 01:56:54.908]  Um, all the stuff I had shared has been censored out.
[01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:56.650]  You're talking about dumb EFRA book?
[01:56:56.670 --> 01:56:58.712]  That's what Zuckerberg calls his users?
[01:57:00.093 --> 01:57:02.015]  Yeah, dumb EFRA book.
[01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:05.038]  I'm not trying to use profanity, folks.
[01:57:05.078 --> 01:57:06.940]  That's what he calls anyone that uses it.
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:08.681]  But I mean, we still use the enemy platform.
[01:57:09.002 --> 01:57:13.466]  Oh yeah, no, they've announced anything libertarian or conservative or gun, they're going to start censoring with pleasure.
[01:57:14.471 --> 01:57:24.618]  Well, I have a couple other pages on their Citizens for Freedom, Warriors for Justice, and stuff like that that I've been sharing too, and they've been kind of censoring them guys out also.
[01:57:25.858 --> 01:57:33.023]  With the thing in the UK about the babies, to me I think that might be a divergent to the real picture that's going on.
[01:57:33.043 --> 01:57:35.785]  No, the fact that they kidnap kids and sell them into sex slavery?
[01:57:35.805 --> 01:57:40.348]  Yeah, for those that don't know, London Telegraph aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[01:57:41.325 --> 01:57:58.538]  Yes, and that makes me think back too because see I have a three-year-old son now and there was a possibility because of health issues that he was having that we might have to abort him and the doctor at that time was trying to talk us into it because they didn't think that he was going to make it.
[01:57:59.198 --> 01:58:08.625]  Well, you know, something told me not to do it and I don't know if I had a guardian angel at that time but now he's like this three-year-old kid who
[01:58:09.232 --> 01:58:12.896]  You know, he's running around, you know, just as healthy as he can be, loves life.
[01:58:12.976 --> 01:58:15.738]  So, you know, I'm kind of glad that I didn't make that decision.
[01:58:15.758 --> 01:58:18.761]  Can you imagine killing the child now?
[01:58:19.882 --> 01:58:22.505]  Oh man, I tell you, I look at my son every day.
[01:58:22.545 --> 01:58:27.009]  You know, he actually listens and watches y'all's podcast with me, believe it or not.
[01:58:27.710 --> 01:58:28.311]  What's his name?
[01:58:28.371 --> 01:58:29.091]  I'll say hi to him.
[01:58:29.912 --> 01:58:30.893]  His name's Shandon.
[01:58:32.248 --> 01:58:44.696]  Shannon, your daddy loves you, and you grow up and be good and stay strong and eat healthy and don't use government drugs because they're not cool, and grow up to raise a good son and daughter and continue the family name on.
[01:58:45.197 --> 01:58:50.100]  We'll be right back with Alan, Jeff, Joey, TJ, and more.
[01:58:52.561 --> 01:58:56.504]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.744 --> 01:59:02.346]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:59:02.586 --> 01:59:07.470]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:59:07.731 --> 01:59:15.597]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:59:15.837 --> 01:59:20.161]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:59:20.381 --> 01:59:24.184]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:59:24.324 --> 01:59:30.027]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:59:30.267 --> 01:59:33.069]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:59:33.449 --> 01:59:38.671]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:59:38.811 --> 01:59:46.936]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[02:00:02.824 --> 02:00:04.745]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:05.205 --> 02:00:07.947]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:14.659 --> 02:00:15.279]  Big Brother.
[02:00:15.959 --> 02:00:16.980]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:18.820]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:20.281]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.061 --> 02:00:21.981]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.621 --> 02:00:26.222]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.803 --> 02:00:30.864]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:41.249 --> 02:00:50.953]  We just joined us, Homeland Security, new manuals have been leaked where they're trying to wage war, including cyber war on anyone who opposes martial law, socialism, or tyranny.
[02:00:51.753 --> 02:00:53.574]  Can't believe I just said that, it's actually true.
[02:00:53.594 --> 02:00:58.936]  I mean, they even call it in the army manuals, re-education camps for conservatives and veterans and gun owners.
[02:00:59.257 --> 02:01:00.737]  That's a Soviet term, by the way.
[02:01:01.738 --> 02:01:02.518]  It's just amazing.
[02:01:04.279 --> 02:01:06.300]  It is a Soviet model the banks are using.
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:08.761]  Because they're exempt from it all.
[02:01:08.881 --> 02:01:09.461]  How incredible.
[02:01:10.149 --> 02:01:12.830]  Alan, Jeff, Joey, TJ, Chris, I'm going to get to all of you.
[02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:15.771]  I'm going to go through a bunch of calls now, up to the bottom of the hour.
[02:01:15.831 --> 02:01:19.892]  Then I'm going to hit some special reports, a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:01:20.693 --> 02:01:22.933]  But right now, let's go to Alan in Pennsylvania.
[02:01:22.953 --> 02:01:23.593]  You're on the air.
[02:01:23.613 --> 02:01:23.994]  Go ahead.
[02:01:24.014 --> 02:01:26.634]  Hello, Alex.
[02:01:27.435 --> 02:01:28.655]  Hello there, my friend.
[02:01:28.675 --> 02:01:31.116]  Hey, how are you doing today?
[02:01:31.196 --> 02:01:31.916]  I'm doing all right.
[02:01:31.936 --> 02:01:32.716]  How are you doing today?
[02:01:32.756 --> 02:01:33.877]  How's the weather in your area?
[02:01:34.824 --> 02:01:35.965]  Well, it's sunny today.
[02:01:36.025 --> 02:01:40.509]  The snow has finally stopped, but I'm driving across Pennsylvania here.
[02:01:40.869 --> 02:01:41.649]  I'm concerned.
[02:01:42.090 --> 02:01:43.151]  You read something there.
[02:01:43.171 --> 02:01:55.020]  I haven't been able to see the story yet because I'm driving a truck across the state, but about the social media being used to maybe organize a protest or demonstration.
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:57.382]  I've been trying to work on something like that for a while.
[02:01:57.402 --> 02:01:58.243]  Yeah, I know.
[02:01:58.263 --> 02:02:00.564]  What they're saying is under martial law,
[02:02:01.445 --> 02:02:07.530]  Under a socialist tyranny, they're preparing Homeland Security to cyber attack and try to block.
[02:02:07.871 --> 02:02:08.691]  They're already doing this.
[02:02:08.711 --> 02:02:09.692]  The censorship's starting.
[02:02:09.953 --> 02:02:13.195]  They're just testing to see what we'll do right now on their platforms.
[02:02:13.215 --> 02:02:14.456]  YouTube, Facebook, you name it.
[02:02:14.917 --> 02:02:15.998]  We have to stay on those platforms.
[02:02:16.018 --> 02:02:16.819]  That's where the people are.
[02:02:17.719 --> 02:02:19.060]  We can't just give that up to them.
[02:02:19.921 --> 02:02:23.144]  But yes, that's the big top report that I was just mentioning.
[02:02:23.524 --> 02:02:27.168]  Homeland Security exercise targets free Americans against socialist tyranny.
[02:02:28.303 --> 02:02:32.246]  Leaked document reveals plan to counter online dissent during martial law.
[02:02:33.848 --> 02:02:34.248]  Right.
[02:02:34.388 --> 02:02:36.310]  Well, I put a website together.
[02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:38.952]  It's MaydayAmerica.com.
[02:02:39.513 --> 02:02:43.716]  I'm trying to organize a demonstration across the country.
[02:02:43.796 --> 02:02:46.579]  Everybody demonstrating at exactly the same time.
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:50.422]  Exactly where you are without having to go anywhere.
[02:02:50.562 --> 02:02:51.623]  Just where you are.
[02:02:51.703 --> 02:02:52.364]  How do you do it?
[02:02:52.564 --> 02:02:54.526]  Scream I'm mad as hell I'm not going to take it anymore?
[02:02:55.464 --> 02:02:57.585]  Well, you know, just stop your car.
[02:02:57.625 --> 02:03:01.788]  Everybody stop for one hour on whatever date.
[02:03:01.868 --> 02:03:04.169]  I haven't gotten a whole lot of followers right now.
[02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:05.550]  Well, listen, that's because it's hard.
[02:03:06.010 --> 02:03:14.434]  It's easier to get somebody big to go with your idea or do a plan that's small to organize folks in your local town to fight some tyranny.
[02:03:15.295 --> 02:03:16.135]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:16.195 --> 02:03:21.899]  I mean, this is a great call because people try to always organize blowing up the Death Star the first day.
[02:03:22.864 --> 02:03:24.166]  You gotta do some other stuff first.
[02:03:24.206 --> 02:03:25.888]  So I would say get a YouTube channel.
[02:03:26.369 --> 02:03:29.173]  Shoot videos on an iPhone or something of what you see on the road.
[02:03:29.574 --> 02:03:30.495]  Have commentary.
[02:03:31.376 --> 02:03:33.379]  Thousands will end up watching each video you do.
[02:03:34.656 --> 02:03:35.956]  You may catch incredible stuff.
[02:03:36.056 --> 02:03:36.676]  Get a following.
[02:03:38.197 --> 02:03:41.077]  Call into local radio when it's Socialist Radio or whatever.
[02:03:42.118 --> 02:03:43.078]  Call into NPR.
[02:03:43.178 --> 02:03:45.098]  Battle them.
[02:03:45.138 --> 02:03:46.259]  Run for City Council.
[02:03:46.759 --> 02:03:47.479]  Stuff like that.
[02:03:48.179 --> 02:03:49.519]  And I'm not poo-pooing your idea.
[02:03:49.539 --> 02:03:50.460]  It might get caught on.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:54.221]  If you're going to try to organize it as a truck driver, it's going to be hard.
[02:03:54.241 --> 02:03:56.101]  You've got to get somebody else to catch on to it.
[02:03:56.141 --> 02:03:56.721]  Maybe it will.
[02:03:57.361 --> 02:04:00.222]  It's a great website address you yelled out there, so we'll see what happens.
[02:04:01.124 --> 02:04:02.164]  Let's go to Jeff in Kansas.
[02:04:02.204 --> 02:04:03.265]  He's got about a minute and a half.
[02:04:03.285 --> 02:04:04.645]  We'll hold you over.
[02:04:04.665 --> 02:04:05.245]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:04:06.766 --> 02:04:08.006]  Hey, Alex.
[02:04:08.727 --> 02:04:09.867]  Thanks a lot for your work.
[02:04:09.947 --> 02:04:10.587]  No need to thank me.
[02:04:10.627 --> 02:04:11.007]  Go ahead.
[02:04:11.067 --> 02:04:11.447]  No, no, no.
[02:04:11.808 --> 02:04:17.069]  Like Rush says, just say dittos, okay?
[02:04:17.449 --> 02:04:24.052]  One of my hired men was up in Chicago a while back, and there was a bomb scare while he was up there.
[02:04:24.072 --> 02:04:26.152]  It shut down a bridge.
[02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:27.573]  It shut down traffic and everything.
[02:04:28.837 --> 02:04:38.089]  The kid ends up making a joke about it on Facebook and wasn't too long after that he was contacted by the FBI.
[02:04:38.309 --> 02:04:39.010]  Oh yeah, stay there.
[02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:40.311]  Let's come back and talk about this.
[02:04:41.152 --> 02:04:41.393]  Alright?
[02:04:42.731 --> 02:04:43.472]  Stay there, yeah.
[02:04:43.792 --> 02:04:48.455]  Making jokes about their security theater and their fear-mongering is a crime according to them.
[02:04:49.296 --> 02:04:52.819]  But if you were just joking and didn't intend to actually make a threat, it's not.
[02:04:52.839 --> 02:04:59.423]  But they'll lie to you and trick you into agreeing you did something wrong because they love putting innocent people in prison because they're criminals.
[02:04:59.443 --> 02:05:00.284]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:09.811 --> 02:05:13.274]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:05:13.374 --> 02:05:15.596]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:05:15.796 --> 02:05:24.082]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:05:24.382 --> 02:05:34.590]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:05:34.930 --> 02:05:48.354]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:05:48.735 --> 02:05:56.077]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose for a limited time.

[02:06:10.287 --> 02:06:14.870]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:06:15.011 --> 02:06:17.973]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:06:18.133 --> 02:06:23.377]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:06:23.697 --> 02:06:25.298]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:06:25.598 --> 02:06:26.939]  We are what we eat.
[02:06:27.259 --> 02:06:31.602]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:06:31.922 --> 02:06:35.905]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:06:36.145 --> 02:06:38.467]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:06:38.707 --> 02:06:44.631]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:20.532]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:07:20.832 --> 02:07:22.693]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:07:22.893 --> 02:07:23.593]  Fluoride!
[02:07:23.773 --> 02:07:25.354]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:07:25.694 --> 02:07:31.996]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:07:32.256 --> 02:07:37.060]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:43.304]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:07:43.504 --> 02:07:45.646]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:07:45.926 --> 02:07:48.548]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:07:48.868 --> 02:07:52.230]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:56.933]  You will find survival shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:57.794 --> 02:08:02.598]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[02:08:02.898 --> 02:08:03.939]  I take it every day.
[02:08:04.079 --> 02:08:06.961]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:10.742 --> 02:08:11.283]  We've got it.
[02:08:11.323 --> 02:08:17.750]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:19.952]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:22.215 --> 02:08:27.841]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:08:40.244 --> 02:08:48.051]  Well, surprise, surprise, as Private Pyle would say, New York uses toll tags to track motorists.
[02:08:48.631 --> 02:08:53.055]  I first documented that 15 years ago, the San Francisco Chronicle about 10 years ago reported it.
[02:08:53.655 --> 02:08:58.759]  All of this stuff has dual use to track you, illegally, and they sell the data.
[02:08:59.019 --> 02:09:01.882]  There's black boxes in all your cars, they're getting ready to tax you by the mile.
[02:09:03.670 --> 02:09:08.333]  So, instead of just denying it's happening, admit it's happening, and culturally say you don't want it.
[02:09:08.934 --> 02:09:14.977]  Don't just have them announce, oh, we're putting the new, you know, toll box in your car, going to tax you by the mile, and the toll box is already there.
[02:09:15.718 --> 02:09:17.639]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:21.081]  New York uses toll tags to track motorists.
[02:09:21.321 --> 02:09:28.806]  For the past 20 years, multiple agencies have been tracking cars with E-ZPass tags nowhere near the toll booth.
[02:09:29.206 --> 02:09:29.607]  Told ya!
[02:09:30.586 --> 02:09:31.206]  Video!
[02:09:31.447 --> 02:09:35.129]  Albuquerque cop opens fire on men for illegally camping.
[02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:39.132]  And they march right up, say, you can't camp out here illegally.
[02:09:39.472 --> 02:09:43.155]  He says, alright, fine, please don't aim guns at me, I'll pick up my stuff, I'll walk down with you.
[02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:46.197]  And they just kill him, and the police chief says, good job!
[02:09:47.301 --> 02:09:49.181]  Who needs to go to jail?
[02:09:49.201 --> 02:09:49.942]  Just execute them.
[02:09:49.962 --> 02:09:50.262]  Good!
[02:09:50.282 --> 02:09:52.522]  Everybody needs a few kills on their belt?
[02:09:52.542 --> 02:09:54.322]  I think they ought to put on police cars.
[02:09:54.342 --> 02:09:57.743]  Like how many people they've killed, kind of like Japanese Zeros or something.
[02:09:58.163 --> 02:09:59.763]  In World War II, how many ships they've sunk.
[02:10:00.283 --> 02:10:01.524]  Like a baby carriage.
[02:10:02.284 --> 02:10:03.964]  Because they're the new warrior police, you know.
[02:10:04.024 --> 02:10:07.005]  Any excuse, because their safety comes first.
[02:10:07.785 --> 02:10:13.206]  And again, folks, deadly force is being way over-applied.
[02:10:14.011 --> 02:10:17.573]  But the police, the police themselves in many areas, so you're going to get these problems.
[02:10:18.354 --> 02:10:20.676]  You got a lot of cops that are just far too scared of everybody.
[02:10:21.416 --> 02:10:27.260]  When you watch this video, I mean, they are all just absolutely scared to death, escalating the thing way out of control.
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:34.305]  And now they've got SWAT teams around the country, they're announcing they're just going to aim guns at you at checkpoints for, quote, ID checks.
[02:10:35.005 --> 02:10:36.847]  And then you just pull up and they're aiming guns at you.
[02:10:36.927 --> 02:10:37.907]  I mean, this is Fallujah.
[02:10:38.748 --> 02:10:39.929]  They're like, it's for our safety.
[02:10:41.394 --> 02:10:43.898]  They can always get some collaborator on the news to go, I like it!
[02:10:43.918 --> 02:10:45.440]  I wake up safe now!
[02:10:47.923 --> 02:10:50.387]  Again, Aborted Babies Burned to Power UK Hospitals.
[02:10:50.427 --> 02:10:51.929]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[02:10:51.949 --> 02:10:53.110]  30 survey.
[02:10:55.782 --> 02:10:59.866]  Results that should sound false but are actually true.
[02:10:59.886 --> 02:11:01.428]  I want to get to that article if I have time.
[02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:03.330]  Ron Paul has an article, U.S.
[02:11:03.370 --> 02:11:06.613]  democracy promotion destroys democracy overseas.
[02:11:07.014 --> 02:11:12.640]  The White House has now turned to cat pitchers to promote Obamacare and other little cuddly creatures.
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:18.386]  I mean this is just shows the constituents they're targeting are the most gullible, mindless, arrested development
[02:11:19.682 --> 02:11:22.623]  Idiots who literally can hardly talk.
[02:11:22.683 --> 02:11:26.604]  I mean, I talk to Obama supporters, and MSNBC is always talking about how smart they are.
[02:11:27.544 --> 02:11:30.005]  No one is dumber than mainline Democrats.
[02:11:30.685 --> 02:11:33.985]  No one is stupider than the average Democrat out there.
[02:11:34.005 --> 02:11:35.106]  And I'm not even a Republican.
[02:11:35.286 --> 02:11:39.007]  I'm just telling you, you've seen Mark Dice's videos, you've seen our videos.
[02:11:39.447 --> 02:11:43.948]  They literally don't know what planet they're on.
[02:11:44.878 --> 02:11:46.160]  Should we ban water for Obama?
[02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:47.081]  Yes, I'll sign the petition.
[02:11:47.341 --> 02:11:49.124]  Should we lock up all gun owners in FEMA camps?
[02:11:49.164 --> 02:11:50.085]  Yes, I'll sign the petition.
[02:11:50.706 --> 02:11:53.049]  Should we burn Jews for the Holocaust at the beach?
[02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:54.070]  Yes, I'll sign the petition.
[02:11:54.891 --> 02:11:55.392]  For Obama.
[02:11:56.670 --> 02:11:58.932]  Should we bring in martial law for Obama?
[02:11:58.972 --> 02:11:59.192]  Yes.
[02:11:59.552 --> 02:12:01.273]  Should we arrest people that criticize Obama?
[02:12:01.373 --> 02:12:01.633]  Yes.
[02:12:02.274 --> 02:12:02.554]  Yes.
[02:12:03.074 --> 02:12:03.374]  Yes.
[02:12:03.895 --> 02:12:04.175]  Yes.
[02:12:04.715 --> 02:12:04.976]  Yes.
[02:12:05.496 --> 02:12:05.796]  Yes.
[02:12:06.296 --> 02:12:06.597]  Yes.
[02:12:07.057 --> 02:12:07.757]  San Diego.
[02:12:08.158 --> 02:12:08.938]  Los Angeles.
[02:12:09.579 --> 02:12:09.879]  Yes.
[02:12:10.339 --> 02:12:10.639]  Yes.
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:11.400]  Yes.
[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:12.200]  Yes.
[02:12:12.741 --> 02:12:13.001]  Yes.
[02:12:13.521 --> 02:12:13.761]  Yes.
[02:12:14.862 --> 02:12:16.003]  And what's YouTube's answer?
[02:12:16.103 --> 02:12:17.003]  Ban his channel!
[02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:26.922]  So there was a big media backlash and we happened to have some contacts inside YouTube that are pretty high level and said, you might want to review this and then they put his channels back up.
[02:12:26.962 --> 02:12:30.424]  But most people don't have those contacts or the following to complain.
[02:12:31.485 --> 02:12:33.706]  And so they're shutting people down across the board.
[02:12:34.527 --> 02:12:35.567]  You want to promote the Second Amendment?
[02:12:35.627 --> 02:12:36.908]  Your Facebook's blocked or gone.
[02:12:37.629 --> 02:12:39.310]  You want to promote Liberty?
[02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:40.470]  You're blocked on YouTube.
[02:12:41.211 --> 02:12:45.153]  And YouTube can deny it because it's their supermods, government mods.
[02:12:45.173 --> 02:12:47.635]  Remember Lieberman a few years ago said,
[02:12:49.229 --> 02:12:50.310]  He wanted to be able to censor things.
[02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:51.271]  We had Michael Moore.
[02:12:51.832 --> 02:12:56.878]  We had a video, one of our contest entries put in that had like 600, 700,000 views, got like 800,000 now.
[02:12:57.258 --> 02:12:58.640]  It was in one day it got like 500,000.
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:00.782]  It was set to go into the tens of millions.
[02:13:01.663 --> 02:13:04.106]  They just blocked it in terms of service violation.
[02:13:04.566 --> 02:13:05.047]  A comedy.
[02:13:06.670 --> 02:13:09.211]  Making fun of Michael Moore, and Michael Moore's people complained.
[02:13:09.611 --> 02:13:12.091]  Michael Moore doesn't just want your guns, he wants your free speech.
[02:13:12.391 --> 02:13:12.931]  And he'll get it!
[02:13:13.431 --> 02:13:15.612]  Bloomberg is on Facebook getting the deal done.
[02:13:15.632 --> 02:13:17.552]  We told you a week before it happened, and then it happened.
[02:13:18.553 --> 02:13:21.273]  That they're getting Facebook to not let you promote Second Amendment stuff.
[02:13:22.513 --> 02:13:23.394]  People are getting the notices.
[02:13:23.414 --> 02:13:30.215]  I remember Darren McBrain a few years ago, with his Facebook, got a notice, we showed it on air, saying, you know, when you talk about politics, it upsets people.
[02:13:30.255 --> 02:13:31.936]  You want to get more likes, don't do it.
[02:13:32.376 --> 02:13:33.596]  We don't want to have to suspend your account.
[02:13:34.571 --> 02:13:36.371]  But you can't use it for a week right now.
[02:13:36.832 --> 02:13:38.232]  Don't do what you're doing anymore.
[02:13:38.692 --> 02:13:40.252]  And of course, it was my stuff they were putting out.
[02:13:41.273 --> 02:13:55.976]  Darren McBreen, in my office, we'd shut it on air, because if you're a radio listener, we're also simulcasting TV, at PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com forward slash news, just to document what we're saying.
[02:13:57.102 --> 02:13:58.463]  So, more of that is coming up.
[02:13:58.823 --> 02:14:05.948]  And then, after I take calls at the bottom of the hour, banker deaths leave industry concerned as coroners probe.
[02:14:05.968 --> 02:14:08.129]  We've been talking about this for a year.
[02:14:08.449 --> 02:14:09.390]  It's accelerating now.
[02:14:09.810 --> 02:14:12.252]  Bloomberg reported it, so now it means it's real.
[02:14:13.372 --> 02:14:16.514]  This mainstream dinosaur reported it.
[02:14:18.075 --> 02:14:19.536]  Let's talk to Jeff in Kansas.
[02:14:19.556 --> 02:14:20.717]  Jeff, restart your story.
[02:14:20.997 --> 02:14:22.058]  You got cut off by the break.
[02:14:24.170 --> 02:14:34.996]  One of my hired men was in Chicago a while back and there was a bomb scare that shut down a bridge there and he ended up making a joke about it on Facebook.
[02:14:35.036 --> 02:14:46.262]  He got held up in traffic or something with it and he made a joke about it on Facebook and then he was contacted by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:14:49.483 --> 02:14:50.844]  You know, he's a real
[02:14:51.734 --> 02:14:52.935]  Uh, rural following kid.
[02:14:52.955 --> 02:14:53.976]  He's very obedient.
[02:14:54.776 --> 02:14:55.897]  Uh, and he's scared.
[02:14:56.037 --> 02:14:56.617]  Scared to death.
[02:14:56.857 --> 02:14:57.498]  Well, he should be.
[02:14:57.538 --> 02:14:58.438]  He's living in a tyranny.
[02:14:59.459 --> 02:15:05.922]  They have loudspeaker announcements, maybe find it, where TSA says, uh, don't make jokes or you'll be arrested.
[02:15:06.223 --> 02:15:07.603]  Next it'll be permanently detained.
[02:15:07.623 --> 02:15:10.745]  Uh, they don't say don't make threats or you could be arrested.
[02:15:10.785 --> 02:15:11.946]  They say don't make jokes.
[02:15:12.786 --> 02:15:14.047]  Because they want you to be scared.
[02:15:14.087 --> 02:15:18.109]  I mean, the mayor of Austin, when you go in to speak for three minutes, he goes, now watch your mouth.
[02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:20.351]  I could have you arrested.
[02:15:21.485 --> 02:15:22.726]  Serious criminal charges.
[02:15:22.786 --> 02:15:24.287]  He wants you to know you're scum.
[02:15:25.728 --> 02:15:34.234]  I kind of hate talking about this, talking about his business and stuff like that, but I was just so appalled by it, and I just wanted to get your analysis on it.
[02:15:35.543 --> 02:15:41.907]  Well, I mean, it's all make-work, because FBI's main mission now is not fighting criminals, because criminals run the government.
[02:15:42.527 --> 02:15:44.908]  It's not white-collar crime, it's political crime.
[02:15:45.489 --> 02:15:46.569]  It's making us the enemy.
[02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:52.133]  And creating enough reports to go to Congress and say, you know, look at these terrorists.
[02:15:52.833 --> 02:15:53.693]  So that's all it is.
[02:15:53.733 --> 02:15:54.714]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:54.734 --> 02:15:59.437]  It's creating the perception there's all this terrorism, the perception there's this danger.
[02:16:01.918 --> 02:16:03.919]  Joey, you're on the air from New York.
[02:16:03.959 --> 02:16:04.700]  Thanks for calling in.
[02:16:06.394 --> 02:16:07.454]  Hey, how you doing today, Al?
[02:16:07.574 --> 02:16:08.155]  Good, I'm doing great.
[02:16:08.175 --> 02:16:08.475]  Go ahead.
[02:16:09.615 --> 02:16:10.115]  Alright, man.
[02:16:10.175 --> 02:16:23.620]  So, alright, I'm 19, and, um, my, like, my generation of people are, um, we're, like, knowledgeable with this whole NWO, the whole, um, trying to depopulate us, make us stupid, blah, blah, blah.
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:30.062]  Um, well, like, a bunch of my friends, we're all, we're all trying to rebuild the society.
[02:16:30.102 --> 02:16:35.504]  We're trying to think about 20 years down the future of how we're going to be, basically,
[02:16:36.650 --> 02:16:37.812]  We're good to go.
[02:16:53.953 --> 02:17:14.084]  Well, I think you start with watching less television, exercising more, finding honorable people to be friends with, doing business with those that have proven that they're honorable, and just being a man, being a woman, if you're a woman out there, and picking an issue that you're going to fight locally, becoming a leader in your area,
[02:17:15.441 --> 02:17:29.604]  Calling yourself a citizen journalist, going out and doing commentary, just like I do with an iPhone, even when I'm not working, and just becoming active in the electronic soapbox, but also the physical soapbox.
[02:17:30.024 --> 02:17:32.024]  The Journey of a Thousand Miles starts with a single step.
[02:17:33.085 --> 02:17:34.185]  Go speak at city council.
[02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:35.165]  It'll be on local cable.
[02:17:35.185 --> 02:17:36.265]  Go speak at county commissioners.
[02:17:36.685 --> 02:17:37.806]  Go speak at the water district.
[02:17:37.826 --> 02:17:39.126]  Say, I want the fluoride out of the water.
[02:17:40.026 --> 02:17:44.307]  Read AP Reuters headlines about brain cancer and bone cancer from it.
[02:17:45.310 --> 02:17:46.251]  Oh, I do, completely.
[02:17:46.291 --> 02:17:49.233]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:17:49.253 --> 02:17:49.393]  Yeah.
[02:17:49.433 --> 02:18:01.661]  I'm just, like, I'm just trying to get my generation to get the proper knowledge to not, like, not necessarily rebuild America, but restore it to what it should, like, how it used to be, you know?
[02:18:15.390 --> 02:18:19.391]  Right there, you cut taxes, and less money goes to Washington, and you cut debt.
[02:18:19.891 --> 02:18:20.992]  It kills dependency.
[02:18:21.392 --> 02:18:22.592]  It promotes individualism.
[02:18:22.612 --> 02:18:23.932]  It's the beginning of the end of the globalist.
[02:18:24.272 --> 02:18:25.973]  Great job, Joey, for calling in.
[02:18:26.033 --> 02:18:27.673]  TJ, in Maryland.
[02:18:27.693 --> 02:18:28.254]  You're on the air.
[02:18:28.274 --> 02:18:28.614]  Go ahead.
[02:18:28.634 --> 02:18:30.634]  This is DJ.
[02:18:30.834 --> 02:18:31.534]  DJ as well.
[02:18:31.554 --> 02:18:32.175]  DJ, welcome, DJ.
[02:18:32.195 --> 02:18:33.555]  Thanks for having me on the show, Alex.
[02:18:33.915 --> 02:18:34.235]  You bet.
[02:18:34.715 --> 02:18:35.596]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[02:18:35.816 --> 02:18:36.016]  You bet.
[02:18:36.056 --> 02:18:39.377]  I have someone in my family who is completely aware of the New World Order.
[02:18:39.397 --> 02:18:41.977]  They know that the banks are absolutely violent.
[02:18:42.017 --> 02:18:43.378]  They know that food is poison.
[02:18:43.398 --> 02:18:44.598]  It's genetically modified.
[02:18:45.034 --> 02:18:47.676]  They know that the vaccines are poison, they have mercury in them.
[02:18:48.256 --> 02:18:55.020]  But she still tunes into MSNBC and watches Reverend Al Sharpton's race-baiting politics.
[02:18:55.100 --> 02:18:56.781]  I mean, everything is about race.
[02:18:57.281 --> 02:18:58.682]  It's absolutely sickening.
[02:18:58.742 --> 02:19:02.564]  It seems like Reverend Al Sharpton himself is keeping racism alive.
[02:19:03.064 --> 02:19:10.929]  How could I convince this person that Reverend Al Sharpton is simply a pawn in the New World Order scheme to help control and manipulate black people?
[02:19:12.386 --> 02:19:17.850]  Well, I would just point out that, you know, Al Sharpton doesn't talk about 50 plus percent of blacks never being born.
[02:19:18.831 --> 02:19:25.155]  I would show her quotes from Margaret Sanger about how they would take over the liberals to get control of blacks.
[02:19:25.215 --> 02:19:32.280]  I would show her LBJ quotes online about how the Democrats were going to try to become the Republicans and claim they wanted to help blacks because they wanted to control them.
[02:19:33.221 --> 02:19:39.466]  And I would explain to her basic domestication and how the system likes to get us dependent
[02:19:40.399 --> 02:19:49.825]  And I would just explain to her that people like Al Sharpton, bottom line, have a goal of keeping people divided and conquered.
[02:19:49.845 --> 02:19:50.706]  Does that answer your question?
[02:19:51.926 --> 02:19:52.547]  Yes, it does.
[02:19:53.007 --> 02:19:53.647]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:19:53.727 --> 02:19:54.668]  But I have one more question.
[02:19:54.848 --> 02:19:55.328]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:19:58.707 --> 02:20:03.770]  Like a lot of my younger generation, like you said, the young African-American... Tell you what, stay there, stay there.
[02:20:03.790 --> 02:20:06.792]  We're gonna come right back to you, let you ask that second question.
[02:20:07.412 --> 02:20:09.653]  We'll go to Chris, Jim, Kyle, Joe, and others.
[02:20:09.874 --> 02:20:13.936]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[02:20:14.096 --> 02:20:16.538]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored.
[02:20:16.678 --> 02:20:21.341]  And more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[02:20:21.522 --> 02:20:25.484]  PRI Fuel Stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[02:20:25.605 --> 02:20:31.549]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at sea rely on PRI Fuel Stabilizers.
[02:20:31.689 --> 02:20:32.310]  And you can too!
[02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:34.211]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit PRIProducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[02:20:40.819 --> 02:20:48.400]  Jessica Armand here, creator of My Magic Mud, the all-natural teeth whitener and strengthening remedy that's getting rave reviews from DCN listeners.
[02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:51.741]  Here's what Austin dentist Dr. Griffin Cole has to say about it.
[02:20:51.841 --> 02:20:53.481]  I really love this Magic Mud product.
[02:20:53.541 --> 02:20:59.522]  Because charcoal is so absorbent, it's very effective at taking off all the sticky plaque and debris that gets stuck on our teeth every day.
[02:20:59.642 --> 02:21:01.083]  I highly recommend My Magic Mud.
[02:21:01.223 --> 02:21:04.803]  Visit MyMagicMud.com to hear the full interview with Dr. Cole.

[02:21:09.542 --> 02:21:12.103]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:21:12.363 --> 02:21:17.244]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:21:17.484 --> 02:21:25.385]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:21:25.605 --> 02:21:29.906]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:21:30.126 --> 02:21:33.947]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:21:34.107 --> 02:21:39.428]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men
[02:21:40.048 --> 02:21:42.829]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:21:43.209 --> 02:21:48.411]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[02:21:48.571 --> 02:21:56.694]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[02:22:09.219 --> 02:22:12.661]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:22:12.881 --> 02:22:16.603]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:22:16.703 --> 02:22:22.607]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:22:22.887 --> 02:22:32.973]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:22:33.093 --> 02:22:34.974]  Take back control of your health with
[02:22:35.074 --> 02:22:37.555]  Pro-EM1 probiotic from Terragenics.

[02:22:47.921 --> 02:22:59.408]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.

[02:23:38.752 --> 02:23:41.314]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:23:41.454 --> 02:23:45.456]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:23:45.756 --> 02:23:46.997]  Silverlungs.com.

[02:23:49.839 --> 02:23:52.640]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.

[02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:07.950]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[02:24:45.687 --> 02:24:47.914]  TJ in Maryland, thank you for holding.
[02:24:47.954 --> 02:24:48.877]  You're back on with us.
[02:24:48.917 --> 02:24:49.659]  What was your question?
[02:24:51.689 --> 02:25:03.317]  Earlier today you were talking with the director John Singleton, or you played an interview clip with John Singleton, and he was talking about the gangster, kill, thug culture that's being pushed in the black community.
[02:25:03.797 --> 02:25:04.597]  And it really is.
[02:25:04.657 --> 02:25:09.440]  If you turn on BET, MTV, that's all you see is this gangster, thug culture.
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:10.181]  And it's cool.
[02:25:10.241 --> 02:25:11.201]  That's what people like.
[02:25:11.662 --> 02:25:16.965]  And people are on Twitter and Facebook all day, this younger generation, and they have no thoughts of their own.
[02:25:17.125 --> 02:25:21.208]  But they repeat it because they think it's cool.
[02:25:21.628 --> 02:25:22.969]  It's not really them that are doing it.
[02:25:22.989 --> 02:25:23.709]  Why do they repeat it?
[02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:25.891]  Well, first do me a favor.
[02:25:25.931 --> 02:25:27.191]  Just talk right into your telephone.
[02:25:27.231 --> 02:25:27.712]  It's muffled.
[02:25:29.493 --> 02:25:32.134]  Why do you think that people just repeat what they see on TV?
[02:25:32.175 --> 02:25:34.716]  Why don't young people have an opinion of their own?
[02:25:34.776 --> 02:25:36.197]  Why can't they arrive at their own conclusion?
[02:25:36.237 --> 02:25:38.599]  Well, that's because they were set in front of a television.
[02:25:39.079 --> 02:25:41.460]  Children are supposed to repeat what their parents teach them.
[02:25:42.401 --> 02:25:43.141]  Or elephants.
[02:25:43.181 --> 02:25:44.802]  The baby elephant learns from its mommy.
[02:25:45.763 --> 02:25:46.864]  Parents aren't parents.
[02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:48.066]  The television is.
[02:25:48.606 --> 02:25:50.708]  The average child watches eight hours of TV.
[02:25:51.029 --> 02:25:52.951]  They go to government training camps the rest of the time.
[02:25:53.551 --> 02:26:03.441]  So, their mommy, their daddy is telling them how to survive, dress like a gangster, be rude to everyone, and all they end up doing is being in prison.
[02:26:04.497 --> 02:26:07.999]  But their mommy, the television, told them they would end up being winners.
[02:26:08.579 --> 02:26:12.441]  I mean, you know, every sitcom out there, the man's an idiot, the mother's the boss.
[02:26:12.982 --> 02:26:14.842]  Well, that doesn't create a happy family.
[02:26:15.103 --> 02:26:19.105]  The women think, I go divorce my husband, I get ahead, I get to be the boss.
[02:26:19.225 --> 02:26:22.486]  No, you just get even more work to do, and the state is now your man.
[02:26:23.267 --> 02:26:26.429]  So it's all been scientifically planned to destroy people.
[02:26:26.909 --> 02:26:32.592]  And so basically, any message you're seeing from mainstream television, you should be asking, what is it trying to sell me?
[02:26:33.533 --> 02:26:37.857]  And the answer is... You said your children belong to the state.
[02:26:39.018 --> 02:26:39.278]  I know.
[02:26:39.738 --> 02:26:41.320]  It's over-the-top tyranny.
[02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:42.401]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:42.761 --> 02:26:44.602]  That's because they think that we're that dumb.
[02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:48.285]  Folks, try to talk right into your telephone.
[02:26:48.426 --> 02:26:50.047]  There's this phenomenon with telephones as well.
[02:26:50.067 --> 02:26:51.048]  Everybody talks like this.
[02:26:51.648 --> 02:26:52.349]  And I can't understand.
[02:26:52.369 --> 02:26:54.130]  Just put the receiver right up to your mouth.
[02:26:54.971 --> 02:26:55.972]  Chris in Austin.
[02:26:55.992 --> 02:26:56.592]  You're on the air.
[02:26:56.612 --> 02:26:57.013]  Go ahead.
[02:26:57.033 --> 02:26:59.015]  Hey, Alex.
[02:26:59.255 --> 02:27:00.296]  How's the reception?
[02:27:01.932 --> 02:27:02.892]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:27:02.912 --> 02:27:04.833]  They were popping in my ear to say they had a video ready.
[02:27:04.873 --> 02:27:05.253]  I'm sorry.
[02:27:05.273 --> 02:27:05.613]  Go ahead.
[02:27:06.993 --> 02:27:07.513]  Oh, okay.
[02:27:07.533 --> 02:27:08.313]  I missed what you said.
[02:27:08.353 --> 02:27:08.733]  Start over.
[02:27:08.773 --> 02:27:09.093]  Go ahead.
[02:27:10.114 --> 02:27:10.914]  How's the reception?
[02:27:11.694 --> 02:27:12.014]  It's good.
[02:27:12.054 --> 02:27:12.534]  I can hear you.
[02:27:13.714 --> 02:27:13.854]  Alright.
[02:27:13.934 --> 02:27:16.075]  I'm calling with Texas Marijuana Liberty.
[02:27:16.895 --> 02:27:19.235]  We're fighting tyranny on the front lines in Austin.
[02:27:20.076 --> 02:27:22.976]  Fighting for medicinal marijuana in Texas.
[02:27:23.996 --> 02:27:27.077]  Now, I know you know... How much pot have you smoked today?
[02:27:28.741 --> 02:27:29.161]  I think so.
[02:27:44.789 --> 02:27:46.030]  I'd like to see it decriminalized.
[02:27:46.050 --> 02:27:56.896]  The problem is, under a lot of state laws, they're just making you a ward of the state, and you're waiving your rights to get medical marijuana, so it's worse than buying it illegally, because the laws have already been reduced.
[02:27:56.916 --> 02:27:57.477]  You understand that?
[02:27:57.757 --> 02:28:01.819]  The globalists aren't going to push for decriminalization unless it's actually something worse.
[02:28:01.839 --> 02:28:02.559]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:06.662]  How do you become a ward of a state?
[02:28:07.387 --> 02:28:20.019]  Well, I mean, they make you sign forms in most states to become a medical marijuana user, and then you waive a lot of your rights, you put yourself in a database, you basically sign up saying you're a drug addict, and they can come in your house whenever they want, when you do it.
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:30.689]  Oh yeah, well I'm not for that, but obviously there's a lot... No, no, I'm for complete, across the board, decriminalization, don't sell it to under 21 years of age, make it like alcohol.
[02:28:31.972 --> 02:28:45.326]  Right, so this is the only way that we see it happening in Texas as far as a public awareness campaign, you know, similar to what you're doing except with, you know, for medicinal marijuana through the use of YouTube until they try to shut us down, you know.
[02:28:45.526 --> 02:28:54.154]  So, and we're going to continue to fight through the internet and we're doing a talk at Brave New Books, April 25th.
[02:29:03.130 --> 02:29:05.651]  Yes, I mean, listen, I'm for decriminalization.
[02:29:05.671 --> 02:29:06.592]  I appreciate your call.
[02:29:07.293 --> 02:29:10.295]  My holy grail is not decriminalizing marijuana.
[02:29:11.667 --> 02:29:30.439]  My holy grail is pointing out that narcotics, heroin and cocaine, and methamphetamine, to a lesser extent, are shipped into the country by C-130s and other aircraft and offloaded at military bases and private corporate reservations, and then are laundered through the big banks to the tune of $500 billion a year.
[02:29:30.479 --> 02:29:31.300]  That's mainstream news.
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:38.705]  And that it's all a facade and a joke when the cops take somebody to jail for cocaine or something, when the government's shipping it in.
[02:29:39.901 --> 02:29:47.204]  So I'm against the big banks getting the drugs, making them illegal, at the end of alcohol prohibition, so they can have a new business.
[02:29:47.785 --> 02:29:52.107]  Because then it lets them control organized crime, the money laundering, everything.
[02:29:52.187 --> 02:29:53.667]  That's why I'm for decriminalization.
[02:29:54.228 --> 02:29:55.448]  I'm not for using drugs.
[02:29:55.708 --> 02:29:58.530]  The same big banks are pushing all these drugs on kids in school.
[02:29:58.990 --> 02:29:59.730]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.770 --> 02:30:00.631]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:00.651 --> 02:30:01.911]  The prescription drugs.
[02:30:01.991 --> 02:30:03.252]  They're pushing the prescription drugs.
[02:30:03.272 --> 02:30:05.573]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.850 --> 02:30:11.491]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:30:11.751 --> 02:30:15.253]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:30:15.413 --> 02:30:19.815]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:30:19.935 --> 02:30:25.938]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:30:26.058 --> 02:30:27.619]  Advanced manufacturing technology.
[02:30:27.619 --> 02:30:27.939]  We're good.
[02:30:50.194 --> 02:31:00.519]  Chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:31:09.583 --> 02:31:12.327]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:31:12.608 --> 02:31:17.455]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:24.806]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:31:24.946 --> 02:31:30.352]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:31:30.572 --> 02:31:34.316]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:31:34.596 --> 02:31:39.121]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:31:39.321 --> 02:31:44.547]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:31:44.767 --> 02:31:47.868]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.

[02:32:18.679 --> 02:32:26.783]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:27.063 --> 02:32:31.765]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:32:31.925 --> 02:32:38.648]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:38.728 --> 02:32:45.812]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:32:45.912 --> 02:32:52.775]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:32:52.935 --> 02:32:57.299]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:32:57.419 --> 02:33:00.683]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:33:00.803 --> 02:33:06.949]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:33:07.109 --> 02:33:08.790]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:33:15.157 --> 02:33:16.777]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:33:16.837 --> 02:33:19.138]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:33:20.458 --> 02:33:23.919]  Mao took the guns.
[02:33:24.039 --> 02:33:28.480]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:30.540]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[02:33:46.181 --> 02:33:49.545]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[02:33:51.627 --> 02:33:54.631]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[02:34:08.237 --> 02:34:09.817]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:34:10.158 --> 02:34:16.499]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:21.321 --> 02:34:25.562]  In Guyana, Africa, they're scrambling to contain deadly Ebola outbreak.
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:35.362]  Aid workers and health officials battled Monday to contain West Africa's first outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Guyana.
[02:34:35.382 --> 02:34:40.904]  That's the Jim Jones scene, as neighboring Liberia reported its first suspected victims.
[02:34:41.604 --> 02:34:53.367]  At least 59 people are known to have died in Guyana's southern forest, but the Liberian cases have confirmed to be the first indication the highly contagious pathogen has crossed into another country.
[02:34:53.407 --> 02:34:55.128]  And boy, is that a bad disease.
[02:34:55.788 --> 02:34:58.411]  Don't have to tell folks about that.
[02:35:00.193 --> 02:35:06.800]  A continuing press covering Michelle Obama have been shoved, screamed at, blocked from events in China.
[02:35:07.220 --> 02:35:11.905]  Let's just say the Chinese are not big fans of the American media.
[02:35:12.867 --> 02:35:15.869]  But Michelle's over there not to investigate or even talk about human rights.
[02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:19.391]  She's there to talk about her dress and what she's wearing.
[02:35:19.471 --> 02:35:20.712]  Truly shameful.
[02:35:20.852 --> 02:35:25.995]  I'm gonna go back to your calls, Jim and Kyle and Joe and Jason and Rob.
[02:35:26.015 --> 02:35:28.456]  I'm gonna get to all of you here in just a few minutes.
[02:35:28.496 --> 02:35:30.517]  The toll-free number to join us for first-time callers is 800-259-9231.
[02:35:30.577 --> 02:35:36.641]  My screen and your calls, all I ask is you have a good telephone.
[02:35:36.661 --> 02:35:41.564]  I don't know if it's my earpiece today or what, but I'm having trouble understanding these callers, and it is annoying, man.
[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:44.401]  Because I'm told by the network it sounds okay.
[02:35:45.001 --> 02:35:45.722]  Something's going on.
[02:35:45.762 --> 02:35:48.043]  But we're going to be, maybe I'm going deaf.
[02:35:50.124 --> 02:35:51.704]  Point is, we're going to be breaking that down in just a moment.
[02:35:51.844 --> 02:35:56.286]  And banker deaths leave industry concerned as coroners probe Bloomberg.
[02:35:56.306 --> 02:35:59.668]  I know you've heard a lot about that from us, but it's finally in dinosaur media.
[02:36:00.088 --> 02:36:01.329]  But before we go any further,
[02:36:03.001 --> 02:36:04.462]  You're all info warriors.
[02:36:04.562 --> 02:36:12.047]  If you believe in the Second Amendment or you believe in non-GMO, the right to even know if food has non-GMO in it, you need to let that be known.
[02:36:13.028 --> 02:36:15.490]  If you are anti-war, you need to let that be known.
[02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:18.832]  If you're pro-family or anti-abortion, you need to let that be known.
[02:36:19.532 --> 02:36:21.994]  Not just let the establishment intimidate you.
[02:36:22.114 --> 02:36:25.577]  And we've produced a whole list, a whole rundown,
[02:36:26.397 --> 02:36:35.030]  A whole catalog, is the proper word, of great anti-socialist, pro-liberty, pro-gun, pro-family, pro-1776 apparel.
[02:36:35.050 --> 02:36:38.796]  We've got a whole line of made in America, extremely affordable.
[02:36:41.104 --> 02:36:43.667]  Golf shirts with Made in 1776 on them.
[02:36:44.508 --> 02:36:50.675]  The Molon Labe Women's Made in America shirt with the gold print on it that really stands out.
[02:36:50.895 --> 02:36:51.816]  Very beautiful shirt.
[02:36:51.836 --> 02:36:55.620]  It says Molon Labe and has a Spartan helmet with crossed M4.
[02:36:57.321 --> 02:36:58.402]  Assault rifles on the back.
[02:36:58.442 --> 02:36:59.822]  It says Infowars.com.
[02:37:00.362 --> 02:37:02.883]  It's got 1776 and Roman numerals on the front.
[02:37:03.124 --> 02:37:04.484]  There's two different variant shirts.
[02:37:05.104 --> 02:37:06.025]  I'm conflating the two.
[02:37:06.305 --> 02:37:07.785]  Then there's a men's shirt as well.
[02:37:07.865 --> 02:37:09.206]  Two women's, two men's.
[02:37:09.586 --> 02:37:10.867]  A design I came up with.
[02:37:11.167 --> 02:37:13.308]  One of our great graphics folks made look good.
[02:37:14.088 --> 02:37:15.168]  So I'm really proud of it.
[02:37:15.188 --> 02:37:16.549]  Our bestseller of all time.
[02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:19.270]  Molon Labe and it's made in 1776.
[02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:21.451]  It even has that on the tag.
[02:37:22.071 --> 02:37:24.515]  Our stuff even has the tags now, are made in 1776.
[02:37:24.575 --> 02:37:35.069]  So you can go to madein1776.com, or you can simply link through at InfoWarsStore.com, into the Made in 1776 section.
[02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:37.232]  We've got Made by Navy Seals,
[02:37:37.953 --> 02:37:38.193]  I think?
[02:37:53.428 --> 02:37:55.310]  That's a great gift for friends and family.
[02:37:55.870 --> 02:38:01.674]  All of it are conversation starters and great ways to promote liberty and fund this operation.
[02:38:02.175 --> 02:38:04.236]  We've got the best water filters, the lowest price.
[02:38:04.557 --> 02:38:06.238]  The promo code WATER, 10% off.
[02:38:06.498 --> 02:38:07.339]  The already lowest price.
[02:38:07.979 --> 02:38:09.460]  We've got the Infowarslife.com.
[02:38:10.501 --> 02:38:12.662]  And again, all of that's on InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:38:13.102 --> 02:38:16.504]  It's just InfoWarsLife.com, MadeIn1776.com.
[02:38:16.924 --> 02:38:31.492]  Those take you right to the subsections with the Made in America Patriot apparel, with the super high quality organic coffee, volcanically grown, with the other products that are right there on the site, like the nascent iodine.
[02:38:31.532 --> 02:38:33.213]  It's just, I mean, look at me, folks.
[02:38:33.253 --> 02:38:38.436]  I'm working harder and more hours and going through more stress than I have at any other time in my life.
[02:38:39.336 --> 02:38:44.300]  And people in person, because the camera puts weight on you, but people on TV can see it as well.
[02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:46.161]  In person, they're like, oh my gosh!
[02:38:46.922 --> 02:38:48.223]  I hardly recognize you.
[02:38:48.303 --> 02:38:50.364]  Your face and your upper body especially.
[02:38:50.384 --> 02:38:51.625]  I still got a little bit of a pot belly.
[02:38:51.665 --> 02:38:54.427]  It's a third the size it was when I'm sitting down.
[02:38:54.467 --> 02:38:55.588]  I still have a tiny pot belly.
[02:38:55.928 --> 02:38:56.929]  It is evaporating.
[02:38:57.670 --> 02:39:03.354]  And I'm doing the same workouts I was doing, but the nascent iodine, the survival shield, the super male vitality.
[02:39:03.394 --> 02:39:06.316]  When I remember to take it, I take it all right now.
[02:39:08.430 --> 02:39:10.551]  I mean, this is not me product-placing, folks.
[02:39:10.871 --> 02:39:11.691]  I'm openly plugging.
[02:39:11.731 --> 02:39:14.192]  I mean, I literally have got to remember to take this stuff.
[02:39:14.572 --> 02:39:15.693]  Take what's recommended.
[02:39:15.733 --> 02:39:16.673]  Talk to your physician.
[02:39:18.894 --> 02:39:20.015]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[02:39:20.495 --> 02:39:21.695]  Just took my Supramel Vitality.
[02:39:22.236 --> 02:39:23.296]  Now I'm taking my second dose.
[02:39:23.336 --> 02:39:26.537]  I did take this this morning of the Survival Shield nascent iodine.
[02:39:27.398 --> 02:39:27.598]  Mmm.
[02:39:29.078 --> 02:39:30.259]  That's the real deal right there.
[02:39:30.759 --> 02:39:33.380]  And then Fluoride Shield that has a nascent iodine and five other compounds.
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:34.621]  Detoxify.
[02:39:34.641 --> 02:39:37.722]  Now, the first
[02:39:38.855 --> 02:39:41.957]  Month, almost everybody like starts detoxing.
[02:39:43.138 --> 02:39:47.501]  And I forget the effect, Dr. Group and other medical doctors call it the same thing.
[02:39:48.001 --> 02:39:48.822]  The Carrington effect?
[02:39:48.862 --> 02:39:50.543]  No, that's when the solar flare hits.
[02:39:51.263 --> 02:39:52.865]  I forget the name of the effect where it happens.
[02:39:52.905 --> 02:39:55.887]  I mean, detoxing, chelating really means you're chelating.
[02:39:56.307 --> 02:39:58.268]  I mean, so get ready.
[02:39:59.289 --> 02:40:00.190]  You might not feel too good.
[02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:02.931]  Some people it's in a week, two weeks, three weeks on average a month.
[02:40:03.312 --> 02:40:04.452]  Some people it doesn't happen to them.
[02:40:04.532 --> 02:40:06.434]  Most people, this is real.
[02:40:06.934 --> 02:40:10.596]  But then after that happens, it's amazing for me especially.
[02:40:10.956 --> 02:40:11.997]  Well, you've heard the rave reviews.

[02:40:25.104 --> 02:40:28.626]  We're really trying to go to the next level here and thanks to your prayers and support we're doing it.
[02:40:28.666 --> 02:40:33.789]  So I want to thank all of you out there that have been supporters, that have bought the different products.

[02:40:47.211 --> 02:40:47.892]  It's all there.
[02:40:47.932 --> 02:40:48.933]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:40:48.973 --> 02:40:50.454]  Enough ranting about those products.
[02:40:50.534 --> 02:40:50.795]  Okay.
[02:40:51.175 --> 02:40:54.158]  I'm going to go to your calls in a moment, but let me hit this story first.
[02:40:55.519 --> 02:40:56.139]  Bloomberg.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.865]  Banker deaths leave industry concerned as coroners probe.
[02:41:03.971 --> 02:41:15.436]  And then it goes over some really big dogs, top people at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, you name it, jumping off buildings, being found dead, being found hung.
[02:41:15.456 --> 02:41:20.058]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we see these a couple times a week, sometimes a couple times a day.
[02:41:21.058 --> 02:41:22.219]  I don't know how many are dead.
[02:41:22.599 --> 02:41:23.459]  I can't keep track of it.
[02:41:23.479 --> 02:41:28.441]  I said, you know, on an interview on TV a few weeks ago, I said, 20 plus bankers.
[02:41:29.682 --> 02:41:31.703]  I just threw that out there because I know it's way more than 20.
[02:41:32.731 --> 02:41:33.071]  I don't know.
[02:41:48.755 --> 02:42:01.986]  Coroners in London are preparing to investigate two apparent suicides as unexpected deaths by finance workers around the world have raised concerns about mental health and stress levels in the industry.
[02:42:02.707 --> 02:42:05.269]  What, for ripping off all the people and knowing the chickens are coming home to roost?
[02:42:05.289 --> 02:42:07.090]  Because undoubtedly some are suicides.
[02:42:07.611 --> 02:42:17.219]  The inquest into the death of William Bokesmith, 58, a retired Deutsche Bank risk executive, yeah, those are the guys that certify the deals, that's who's mainly dying,
[02:42:18.214 --> 02:42:19.395]  And who's you certified for?
[02:42:19.455 --> 02:42:22.358]  Well, try falling 50 stories, that'll get you quiet.
[02:42:23.199 --> 02:42:25.841]  In his London home in January, we'll start tomorrow.
[02:42:26.662 --> 02:42:39.834]  The inquest from Gabriel Maggi, a 39-year-old vice president of technology operations at JPMorgan Chase Co., who died after falling from the firm's 33-story London headquarters, is scheduled for late May.
[02:42:39.854 --> 02:42:42.177]  And there's never a discussion about the cameras around these buildings.
[02:42:42.864 --> 02:42:49.531]  If I'm ever up in a big building and I fall off, I want all the local cameras pulled, I want the cameras across pulled, the news cameras pulled.
[02:42:50.132 --> 02:42:51.894]  I did not commit suicide, I was thrown off.
[02:42:51.934 --> 02:42:52.574]  Let's get that clear.
[02:42:56.378 --> 02:43:02.205]  The suicides were followed by others around the world, including JP Morgan in Hong Kong, as well as Mike Duker.
[02:43:03.612 --> 02:43:10.633]  The chief economist at Seattle-based Russell Investments Management, the financial world's aggressive, hard-hitting culture may be hurting itself.
[02:43:11.234 --> 02:43:11.374]  Oh!
[02:43:11.834 --> 02:43:17.595]  Professionals advising on mental health in the industry say, how about they're being murdered, red rum, red rum.
[02:43:19.155 --> 02:43:21.016]  That's murder backwards if you've seen The Shining.
[02:43:22.036 --> 02:43:32.158]  At greatest risk are those who have not cultivated friendships, networks outside of the company, said Stuart Black, professor of global leadership and strategy, IMD, a business school.
[02:43:33.049 --> 02:43:34.610]  Goes into culture change.
[02:43:35.090 --> 02:43:37.871]  Yeah, so the coroners are probing.
[02:43:37.891 --> 02:43:40.893]  No, coroners probe murder.
[02:43:41.713 --> 02:43:44.115]  Coroners probe because there might be foul play.
[02:43:44.735 --> 02:43:45.775]  There's a question of that.
[02:43:46.956 --> 02:43:48.737]  They don't probe because of mental states.
[02:43:49.617 --> 02:43:52.199]  That's a Spin article out of Bloomberg.
[02:43:53.859 --> 02:43:56.841]  Hey, all the evil you've done, Bloomberg, in Chicago, in New York, with all those victims.
[02:43:57.321 --> 02:43:58.722]  How do you feel after everything you've done?
[02:44:02.341 --> 02:44:12.911]  Alright folks, bottom line, I got a bunch of other news I want to get to here, but let's hit the homeless man killed and then we'll go back to your calls.
[02:44:14.412 --> 02:44:20.378]  A homeless man who was sleeping in Albuquerque, New Mexico, State Park, is confronted by police in the video we're about to show you.
[02:44:20.698 --> 02:44:25.103]  We're showing you the unedited one, we went and found the raw one released by the court inquest.
[02:44:26.463 --> 02:44:28.163]  Not released by the police, edited.
[02:44:28.723 --> 02:44:35.505]  As he collects his items and turns around to surrender, the police use a flashbang and release a police dog.
[02:44:35.545 --> 02:44:41.726]  He then pulls items from his pockets, which might be knives, and is shot in the back by police as he tries to run away.
[02:44:41.746 --> 02:44:46.447]  And it looks like some hillbilly probably has a mental problem.
[02:44:48.167 --> 02:44:50.748]  And they're all scared of him, so call in the SWAT team.
[02:44:51.648 --> 02:44:52.908]  And don't worry, they bagged him.
[02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:55.571]  Nice video game.
[02:44:55.771 --> 02:45:01.198]  So, uh... I mean, they should have just got bullhorns and got down a hundred yards away.
[02:45:01.218 --> 02:45:04.522]  They were so scared and said, come out with your hands up and then just waited ten minutes.
[02:45:04.542 --> 02:45:06.765]  But no, they went up with their guns twenty feet away.
[02:45:07.639 --> 02:45:09.801]  You got about 10 deputies all pointing guns at him.
[02:45:10.521 --> 02:45:12.303]  He freaks out, runs away, they shoot him in the back.
[02:45:12.343 --> 02:45:15.245]  And it's just, it's just, this stuff is happening with more and more frequency.
[02:45:15.885 --> 02:45:19.829]  And the police are like, it was good, good mission, took him out, battling Al-Qaeda.
[02:45:20.269 --> 02:45:23.912]  Let's go ahead and go to the raw video and I'll give you a play-by-play for your radio lister.
[02:45:23.932 --> 02:45:25.113]  We're going to post the raw video.
[02:45:25.393 --> 02:45:27.935]  We have the edited video in an article on Infowars.com.
[02:45:28.375 --> 02:45:30.117]  I'm going to have this raw video posted on there.
[02:45:30.777 --> 02:45:40.002]  Uh, or give them the link, guys, that's, you know, that you found on the raw video, or they'll end up thinking I mean, take it and post it, it'll turn into a big 10-hour deal, just give them the video and they'll post it, thanks.
[02:45:40.462 --> 02:45:43.544]  Okay, um, here is this shocking video.
[02:45:44.824 --> 02:45:46.665]  They got a German Shepherd.
[02:46:02.233 --> 02:46:05.696]  They throw a flashbang at him, I forgot that part.
[02:46:08.518 --> 02:46:10.460]  Do it.
[02:46:13.262 --> 02:46:15.184]  Get on the ground!
[02:46:15.604 --> 02:46:16.745]  Get on the ground now!
[02:46:16.925 --> 02:46:17.546]  That's clear murder.
[02:46:17.586 --> 02:46:18.226]  Get on the ground!
[02:46:18.887 --> 02:46:19.587]  Get on the ground!
[02:46:20.388 --> 02:46:20.748]  Ha!
[02:46:23.671 --> 02:46:24.311]  Shot him in the back.
[02:46:24.672 --> 02:46:27.174]  Okay, now watching that video, back it up, I'm gonna play it again.
[02:46:29.056 --> 02:46:32.477]  The dog comes up and starts biting at his crotch, trying to rip his genitals off.
[02:46:32.517 --> 02:46:34.017]  That's what a lot of those attack dogs will do.
[02:46:34.057 --> 02:46:36.378]  So, the guy standing there with his bag, he says, I'm walking down.
[02:46:36.398 --> 02:46:39.359]  It's not a big deal, I'm just camping up here, homeless.
[02:46:40.359 --> 02:46:42.199]  They send the dog in to rip his genitals off.
[02:46:42.639 --> 02:46:43.580]  He goes, why, why, why?
[02:46:43.620 --> 02:46:45.060]  He begins to try to push the dog away.
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:48.781]  Flashbang goes off, he gets startled, turns to the side.
[02:46:50.441 --> 02:46:51.382]  Dog's attacking him.
[02:46:52.302 --> 02:46:53.062]  And they shoot him in the butt.
[02:46:54.249 --> 02:46:57.110]  These are soldiers, folks, and they want to fight an enemy, and we're the enemy.
[02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:58.830]  And it's Fallujah-style.
[02:46:58.970 --> 02:46:59.490]  And we're dead!
[02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:10.532]  And they've been trained like this because they're going to bring the country down, take all the pension funds, and America's done, and they're going to arrest their political enemies, they're going to have a civil war, and all these cops aren't going to be fighting homeless guys.
[02:47:11.392 --> 02:47:14.173]  They're not going to be fighting people that wait until you surround them with a dog and all this.
[02:47:15.053 --> 02:47:20.414]  And what's scary is, I guarantee you, these cops aren't even bad people, they're just brainwashed and sick.
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:25.463]  And they're going to have to drink from the cup that is America that's going to implode.
[02:47:26.764 --> 02:47:29.907]  We killed 54 million babies, we've done it all, and we're just an evil country.
[02:47:29.927 --> 02:47:31.508]  Well, let's just get down to brass tacks here.
[02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:38.694]  Let's, again, if you're a radio listener, I'll post on Infowars.com the raw video, but...
[02:47:41.414 --> 02:47:48.475]  They shoot the guy in the back, and I mean, they assault him with a dog, and throw a flashbang at him, all because it's a big hunting deal.
[02:47:48.495 --> 02:47:49.256]  They're just hunters!
[02:47:49.996 --> 02:47:52.356]  Call me the hunter!
[02:47:52.876 --> 02:47:54.277]  That's my name!
[02:47:54.297 --> 02:47:56.977]  Pretty young thing like you!
[02:47:57.417 --> 02:47:59.278]  That's my only game!
[02:48:01.658 --> 02:48:04.659]  Well, in their case, they're not looking for a beautiful young lady.
[02:48:05.529 --> 02:48:07.190]  Like Roy Orbison was.
[02:48:07.470 --> 02:48:10.792]  Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet.
[02:48:11.132 --> 02:48:14.273]  Pretty woman, walking down the street.
[02:48:14.674 --> 02:48:15.294]  No, no.
[02:48:15.694 --> 02:48:16.694]  They want to hunt men.
[02:48:17.355 --> 02:48:19.216]  They didn't go join the Navy SEALs to do it.
[02:48:19.656 --> 02:48:21.197]  They're going to hunt a homeless man.
[02:48:21.217 --> 02:48:23.138]  And they're going to shoot him in the back.
[02:48:23.638 --> 02:48:25.599]  And let that dog go out of his tentacle.
[02:48:27.665 --> 02:48:30.766]  At the NSA base, we pull in the parking lot, we're going to interview the media, we're here to talk.
[02:48:30.986 --> 02:48:32.506]  There's a main base gate right there.
[02:48:32.526 --> 02:48:35.087]  And they go, we got a dog to attack you!
[02:48:35.867 --> 02:48:38.928]  We bring a dog out here on you!
[02:48:39.889 --> 02:48:41.529]  What you do, talk to the American!
[02:48:43.930 --> 02:48:47.971]  You're supposed to, I mean, they literally, we're supposed to just grovel in fear, land of the coward, home of the slave.
[02:48:48.351 --> 02:48:52.532]  Why doesn't the American people be, the new symbol is a jellyfish?
[02:48:52.552 --> 02:48:54.253]  I mean, that's what you want, right?
[02:48:55.745 --> 02:48:58.112]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to the footage again as I break it down.
[02:48:58.132 --> 02:48:59.235]  This is really shocking.
[02:49:00.358 --> 02:49:02.926]  And again, they've already assaulted him with a flashbang and a dog in his genitals.
[02:49:03.953 --> 02:49:05.534]  And he pulls something out of his pocket.
[02:49:05.554 --> 02:49:07.214]  If I had a knife, I think I'd stab that dog.
[02:49:07.254 --> 02:49:08.495]  You're supposed to sit there in America.
[02:49:08.735 --> 02:49:13.756]  The new way to shake hands with the police is to literally pull your genitals off and have a dog bite it off.
[02:49:14.036 --> 02:49:17.397]  And then the cops will taser you and jump on your head and charge you with assault.
[02:49:17.658 --> 02:49:23.239]  And then they can go home while you're in a prison, while they're racking up all of the reap what you sow.
[02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:24.700]  Their kids are going to have cancer.
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:27.701]  They're going to have car wrecks, horrible lives, divorces, everything.
[02:49:27.841 --> 02:49:28.961]  And you don't know why you're cursed.
[02:49:29.221 --> 02:49:30.422]  Because you're evil!
[02:49:31.222 --> 02:49:33.324]  Anybody that does evil gets bad.
[02:49:33.884 --> 02:49:36.567]  One way or another, it comes back on you fools!
[02:49:37.067 --> 02:49:39.549]  Now go ahead and go to the footage of them murdering this guy.
[02:49:39.749 --> 02:49:41.431]  But the police chief says it's okay.
[02:49:42.652 --> 02:49:43.773]  Alright, flashbang.
[02:49:44.854 --> 02:49:45.974]  Dog goes for the genitals.
[02:49:46.755 --> 02:49:51.159]  Shoot him in the butt.
[02:49:53.581 --> 02:49:54.401]  And that's a drug dog.
[02:49:54.421 --> 02:49:55.803]  It looks like it's obsessed with his bag.
[02:49:57.014 --> 02:49:57.534]  Moving up!
[02:49:57.794 --> 02:49:58.615]  I'm a Marine!
[02:49:59.415 --> 02:50:00.715]  Just took out a homeless man!
[02:50:00.895 --> 02:50:01.676]  I'm really tough!
[02:50:01.956 --> 02:50:04.417]  I'm really something else!
[02:50:04.457 --> 02:50:07.037]  Look, they're all excited.
[02:50:08.038 --> 02:50:11.519]  It's better than duck hunting!
[02:50:12.739 --> 02:50:13.500]  It's still on him!
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:15.000]  Oh God, we're not safe!
[02:50:16.341 --> 02:50:17.001]  We just shot him!
[02:50:17.141 --> 02:50:17.581]  Look out!
[02:50:17.781 --> 02:50:18.621]  Oh, it's other voices!
[02:50:18.661 --> 02:50:19.642]  Oh my God!
[02:50:20.782 --> 02:50:23.723]  I saw this video where they shoot this family's basket hound twice.
[02:50:24.103 --> 02:50:26.064]  They just shot him again?
[02:50:28.637 --> 02:50:29.438]  Oh yeah!
[02:50:30.218 --> 02:50:30.678]  Kill him!
[02:50:31.558 --> 02:50:33.859]  Kill him!
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:37.541]  And they shoot the dog and they're like, yeah dog's upstairs!
[02:50:37.681 --> 02:50:38.682]  He charged me!
[02:50:38.802 --> 02:50:40.342]  See this dog's tail wagging when they shoot it?
[02:50:41.403 --> 02:50:43.084]  Oh yeah, release the dog on him after you kill him.
[02:50:43.324 --> 02:50:43.964]  Yeah!
[02:50:44.424 --> 02:50:45.244]  Yeah!
[02:50:45.545 --> 02:50:46.105]  Hunting him!
[02:50:46.225 --> 02:50:47.886]  Hunting man's what I like to do!
[02:50:47.926 --> 02:50:48.446]  Yeah!
[02:50:48.466 --> 02:50:49.346]  Yeah!
[02:50:54.855 --> 02:50:57.256]  Oh yeah, have the dog ripping at his leg after they shoot him.
[02:50:57.576 --> 02:50:58.357]  Yeah!
[02:50:58.897 --> 02:51:00.038]  Yeah, shoot him over and over.
[02:51:00.078 --> 02:51:01.058]  Yeah, step on him!
[02:51:01.518 --> 02:51:02.979]  Step on him after you kill him!
[02:51:03.259 --> 02:51:04.920]  And let that dog chew on him!
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:06.821]  That dog wanted his testicles!
[02:51:07.421 --> 02:51:07.882]  Dog!
[02:51:07.962 --> 02:51:08.622]  Feed it to him!
[02:51:09.898 --> 02:51:10.999]  Attention gun owners.
[02:51:11.279 --> 02:51:15.961]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[02:51:16.081 --> 02:51:19.523]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[02:51:19.763 --> 02:51:21.925]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.

[02:51:39.694 --> 02:51:40.735]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:40.815 --> 02:51:45.159]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:45.319 --> 02:51:50.923]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:51.023 --> 02:51:53.125]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[02:51:53.185 --> 02:51:54.366]  No word about IRAs.
[02:51:54.606 --> 02:51:57.168]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:57.268 --> 02:52:02.092]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:52:02.232 --> 02:52:02.473]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:02.513 --> 02:52:03.854]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:16.581]  So, Dad, you're sounding a lot better.
[02:52:16.601 --> 02:52:18.762]  How have you been feeling since your heart attack?
[02:52:19.002 --> 02:52:21.223]  Well, son, I am feeling a lot better.
[02:52:21.503 --> 02:52:25.885]  Ever since your sister ordered me a bottle of HeartDrop 2000's XtendoVite for my heart.
[02:52:26.305 --> 02:52:26.865]  HeartDrop?
[02:52:26.985 --> 02:52:27.626]  XtendoVite?
[02:52:27.886 --> 02:52:28.326]  What's that?
[02:52:28.766 --> 02:52:33.428]  Well, it's just seven herbs that are approved for helping keep my heart healthy.
[02:52:33.708 --> 02:52:34.508]  That's great, Dad.
[02:52:34.848 --> 02:52:35.869]  I was getting worried about you.
[02:52:36.309 --> 02:52:37.329]  I am so glad it's helping.
[02:52:37.749 --> 02:52:38.470]  So am I, son.
[02:52:39.010 --> 02:52:40.950]  I'm very glad your sister got it for me.
[02:52:41.511 --> 02:52:43.631]  I wish I had known about it before my heart attack.
[02:52:43.931 --> 02:52:45.532]  Yeah, but would you have taken it, though?
[02:52:46.272 --> 02:52:47.793]  You know, I'm not sure if I would have.
[02:52:48.413 --> 02:52:50.273]  But I'm awful glad I'm taking it now.
[02:52:50.994 --> 02:52:51.914]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[02:52:51.934 --> 02:52:52.354]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[02:54:29.366 --> 02:54:34.391]  You know, we all got really, really upset during that last segment and during the break.
[02:54:36.333 --> 02:54:41.278]  Because then they handcuff his dead body and act all scared of the dead body, because that makes it okay what they've just done.
[02:54:42.219 --> 02:54:51.628]  They attack a homeless guy with a flashbang and a dog, shoot him in the back, and then shoot him more with a bing bag gun, and it looks like real firearms, 223.
[02:54:54.232 --> 02:54:55.873]  And then they go over and step on his body.
[02:54:55.893 --> 02:54:57.335]  He's clearly, you know, dying.
[02:54:58.055 --> 02:54:58.996]  And then handcuff him.
[02:55:00.917 --> 02:55:06.722]  And they could have just done with it in San Francisco where they shoot the handcuffed guy in the back and the bullet bounces back up through his body and hits his heart.
[02:55:07.002 --> 02:55:07.983]  Just claim he attacked him.
[02:55:09.424 --> 02:55:13.448]  But the sick thing is the police chief totally defended this because they, quote, felt threatened.
[02:55:14.408 --> 02:55:17.050]  And that's the new thing where police are like God.
[02:55:17.090 --> 02:55:17.751]  You're not God.
[02:55:18.051 --> 02:55:23.536]  You're being set up to be death squads to kill whoever you want because a criminal group's taking the country over.
[02:55:24.352 --> 02:55:33.521]  And everyone's horrified by this, and it's disgusting, especially when they look so excited while they're doing it, and the police chief says, great job, police.
[02:55:34.903 --> 02:55:37.105]  You know, not well as tragic as this happened, but they felt threatened.
[02:55:37.125 --> 02:55:38.086]  No, it's just, oh, great job.
[02:55:38.506 --> 02:55:39.868]  I'm going to do a special report on this.
[02:55:42.492 --> 02:55:47.756]  But just, just, just, you know, the news media cuts it when they pull the trigger.
[02:55:47.896 --> 02:55:48.717]  You don't see him get shot.
[02:55:48.737 --> 02:55:50.919]  Because they don't want you to see the rest of the shooting him.
[02:55:51.259 --> 02:55:55.822]  And the dog, after they've already shot him more, they just let the dog sit there and bite him.
[02:55:56.143 --> 02:55:57.444]  Come on in and bite him!
[02:55:58.024 --> 02:55:59.485]  Oh, he moved his arm again.
[02:55:59.585 --> 02:56:00.366]  Shoot him again.
[02:56:00.946 --> 02:56:03.589]  You don't like a dog chewing on your boy?
[02:56:05.050 --> 02:56:06.010]  Send in a dog.
[02:56:06.111 --> 02:56:07.752]  If he runs, shoot him in the back.
[02:56:09.185 --> 02:56:12.326]  And it's like Yosemite Sam has become the police or something.
[02:56:13.287 --> 02:56:14.967]  And it's not like they were chasing a killer.
[02:56:15.447 --> 02:56:19.049]  It's not like they were going after some super max guy that has escaped.
[02:56:19.689 --> 02:56:21.090]  Or a child molester or something.
[02:56:22.350 --> 02:56:25.451]  It's just regular, all the time it's autistic people or old people.
[02:56:25.851 --> 02:56:30.493]  Clearly I've seen those squad car videos where some autistic person doesn't know what planet they're on, they'll kill them.
[02:56:31.874 --> 02:56:35.135]  Get on the ground, they don't get on the ground, start beating them, tasing them, they try to run, shoot them.
[02:56:36.031 --> 02:56:37.112]  And the police go, that's right!
[02:56:37.432 --> 02:56:38.813]  We gonna kill more or we won't!
[02:56:39.874 --> 02:56:42.076]  And I see all these videos where it'll be somebody in a wheelchair.
[02:56:42.116 --> 02:56:43.076]  Get out of the wheelchair!
[02:56:43.537 --> 02:56:44.737]  I'm sorry, I'm a quadriplegic.
[02:56:44.777 --> 02:56:49.521]  Get your butt... I'm gonna smack you with a baton, throw him out of the wheelchair on the ground.
[02:56:50.682 --> 02:56:54.605]  I mean, look at all the other tyranny.
[02:56:54.945 --> 02:56:56.266]  And look at Jimmy Carter.
[02:56:57.146 --> 02:56:57.727]  A president.
[02:56:58.928 --> 02:57:00.309]  As a matter of fact, you know, I have felt
[02:57:19.313 --> 02:57:22.494]  That my own communications were probably monitored.
[02:57:23.054 --> 02:57:23.595]  No kidding?
[02:57:23.615 --> 02:57:32.017]  When I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write the letter myself, put it in the post office, and mail it.
[02:57:33.158 --> 02:57:34.298]  Old-fashioned snail mail.
[02:57:34.518 --> 02:57:38.259]  Yeah, because I believe if I send an email, it will be monitored.
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:42.641]  By the way, folks, this hour was brought to you by mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:57:42.661 --> 02:57:45.202]  We find all the specials non-GMO, organic.
[02:57:46.024 --> 02:57:49.165]  They've got great customer service, and I think they're the best storable foods company out there.
[02:57:49.265 --> 02:57:51.226]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:57:51.606 --> 02:57:52.807]  The toll-free number's there on the site.
[02:57:53.667 --> 02:57:54.508]  Man, I'm out of time.
[02:57:54.628 --> 02:57:57.069]  I know we've got Jim in Connecticut.
[02:57:58.240 --> 02:58:05.884]  And I know we've got Kyle in Arizona, and we've got Joe in Maine, and Jason in Florida, and Rob in Los Angeles.
[02:58:06.364 --> 02:58:07.545]  I will go to break.
[02:58:07.645 --> 02:58:10.266]  I won't be able to get to Rob and Jason, but I'll get to Jim, Kyle, and Joe.
[02:58:10.587 --> 02:58:13.068]  But you'll each have a minute or so, and I'm going to go to the next person.
[02:58:13.348 --> 02:58:16.069]  We're going to start the Overdrive at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:16.350 --> 02:58:18.571]  Some stations don't carry this fourth hour because I don't always do it live.
[02:58:18.591 --> 02:58:22.593]  We used to do four hours all the time, but I cut back to three because of all the other duties I've got around here.
[02:58:23.393 --> 02:58:24.534]  But this is an emotional show.
[02:58:24.574 --> 02:58:26.055]  I mean, I'm emotional about all this.
[02:58:26.955 --> 02:58:29.056]  And I know we're not safe, and I know we're a third world country.
[02:58:29.916 --> 02:58:32.656]  I mean, it came out that the Pentagon spies on all Americans.
[02:58:33.196 --> 02:58:35.357]  And it was called, you know, last week it was in the L.A.
[02:58:35.397 --> 02:58:36.817]  Times that we're a banana republic.
[02:58:37.557 --> 02:58:39.418]  Yeah, that's banana boat stuff, folks.
[02:58:39.478 --> 02:58:41.478]  That's bad.
[02:58:41.578 --> 02:58:43.119]  I mean, this stuff isn't good.
[02:58:43.459 --> 02:58:45.239]  You can try to dress it up and say it's okay.
[02:58:45.519 --> 02:58:49.520]  Everybody knows deep down it's not okay, and it's getting a lot worse.
[02:58:50.861 --> 02:58:52.444]  And they're going to bring in a civil war.
[02:58:52.665 --> 02:58:53.586]  I want to stop that.
[02:58:54.348 --> 02:58:55.550]  I want peace.
[02:58:55.730 --> 02:58:56.632]  I don't want a war.
[02:58:56.832 --> 02:58:58.295]  But I'm not going to your FEMA camp.
[02:58:59.616 --> 02:59:10.003]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:59:10.303 --> 02:59:12.164]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:59:12.344 --> 02:59:13.045]  Fluoride!
[02:59:13.245 --> 02:59:14.826]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:59:15.166 --> 02:59:21.470]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:59:21.730 --> 02:59:26.535]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:59:26.655 --> 02:59:32.721]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:59:32.961 --> 02:59:35.143]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:59:35.403 --> 02:59:38.026]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:59:38.326 --> 02:59:41.709]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:59:41.829 --> 02:59:46.391]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:47.251 --> 02:59:52.053]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[02:59:52.353 --> 02:59:53.414]  I take it every day.
[02:59:53.554 --> 02:59:59.256]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:00:00.637 --> 03:00:01.797]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:02.157 --> 03:00:03.578]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:04.218 --> 03:00:07.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.608 --> 03:00:15.249]  Big Brother.
[03:00:15.909 --> 03:00:16.930]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:18.791]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:19.432 --> 03:00:20.232]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.013 --> 03:00:21.933]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.574 --> 03:00:26.156]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.757 --> 03:00:30.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.732 --> 03:00:37.213]  Well, the police are announcing they're going to get taser drones to fly around Zappingus.
[03:00:37.233 --> 03:00:37.993]  Told you that was coming.
[03:00:38.674 --> 03:00:39.154]  15 years ago.
[03:00:39.174 --> 03:00:40.674]  10 years ago, whatever.
[03:00:40.694 --> 03:00:41.675]  I think it was more like 15.
[03:00:41.755 --> 03:00:42.875]  I said 10 earlier.
[03:00:43.395 --> 03:00:45.476]  Here's a new article up on InfoWars.com.
[03:00:46.176 --> 03:00:51.358]  Michelle Obama has come out and said that you will not call women bossy or anyone bossy, because that's their word.
[03:00:51.378 --> 03:00:52.658]  Because they're bossy.
[03:00:53.138 --> 03:00:56.639]  Violent, ugly, authoritarian face of mainstream feminism exposed yet again.
[03:00:56.659 --> 03:00:58.980]  The new hashtag, kill all men.
[03:01:00.387 --> 03:01:07.650]  Hashtag Annoying, Hashtag Hag, Hashtag Control Freak, Hashtag Authoritarian, Hashtag Eugenics.
[03:01:09.090 --> 03:01:15.172]  I'm going to retweet this and say Hashtag Authoritarian, Scoundrel, Control Freak, Dirtbag, Witches.
[03:01:15.192 --> 03:01:16.112]  How about that?
[03:01:16.953 --> 03:01:18.933]  Twitter, Feminist Campaign to Kill All Men.
[03:01:19.514 --> 03:01:20.354]  And you can read it.
[03:01:20.374 --> 03:01:25.696]  I mean, this is a massive Twitter following about how they want to have anarchy and kill all men.
[03:01:26.536 --> 03:01:27.316]  Hillary would agree.
[03:01:27.336 --> 03:01:28.917]  She probably, well, you know how Hillary is.
[03:01:29.946 --> 03:01:31.386]  I understand why these women want to kill all men.
[03:01:31.426 --> 03:01:33.607]  I don't think the men are being too attracted to them.
[03:01:33.627 --> 03:01:36.908]  And it's not that these women are even ugly, per se.
[03:01:36.948 --> 03:01:41.009]  It's just they have that twitly, disconnected hatred of male power.
[03:01:41.029 --> 03:01:44.871]  Instead of the love of male power, the love of female power.
[03:01:46.931 --> 03:01:47.812]  Oh my goodness.
[03:01:47.872 --> 03:01:50.352]  I mean, any real man wants a really powerful woman.
[03:01:51.633 --> 03:01:54.414]  But any real woman wants a powerful man, don't you, Cupcake?
[03:01:54.954 --> 03:01:57.235]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Connecticut.
[03:01:57.255 --> 03:01:58.235]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:01:59.671 --> 03:02:00.673]  Alex, how you doing today?
[03:02:00.693 --> 03:02:04.520]  Jim with We Are Change Connecticut out here fighting the fluoridation of the public water supply.
[03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:07.405]  So I want to tell you and all you listeners that I have a senator
[03:02:07.944 --> 03:02:13.008]  His name is, uh, Joe Markley, getting ready to fight infloridation again in the state of Connecticut.
[03:02:13.428 --> 03:02:16.871]  Connecticut was the first state in the union to make it a mandate.
[03:02:17.251 --> 03:02:21.595]  So we're gonna hope to get the first state in the union to repeal this mandate.
[03:02:21.635 --> 03:02:28.580]  So we're looking for all your support, all your members' support, and anybody in Connecticut to get a hold of Joe Markley or get a hold of WeAreStatesTV.org.
[03:02:30.643 --> 03:02:31.343]  Absolutely.
[03:02:31.723 --> 03:02:32.663]  Countries are banning it.
[03:02:32.984 --> 03:02:34.104]  Major cities are banning it.
[03:02:34.124 --> 03:02:35.264]  From Canada to the U.S.
[03:02:35.684 --> 03:02:36.504]  We are on the march.
[03:02:36.984 --> 03:02:41.165]  And once we remove one forced medication on the water and the food, we can get them all out.
[03:02:41.245 --> 03:02:41.965]  And we are winning.
[03:02:42.365 --> 03:02:45.006]  We've already had them start banning it as a pesticide.
[03:02:46.126 --> 03:02:47.487]  We're doing a good job in this state.
[03:02:47.547 --> 03:02:48.547]  I tried two years ago.
[03:02:48.587 --> 03:02:51.107]  I started working locally with my aldermen.
[03:02:51.127 --> 03:02:52.308]  They don't want to listen to us.
[03:02:52.788 --> 03:02:55.108]  I kept moving up the branch and I got to a senator.
[03:02:55.528 --> 03:02:59.129]  We have a lot of great guys in Connecticut with the We Are Change group that are really
[03:03:00.493 --> 03:03:04.355]  Great job, brother.
[03:03:04.395 --> 03:03:05.735]  Gotta give the other callers one minute.
[03:03:05.775 --> 03:03:07.196]  Kyle in Arizona, then Joe in Maine.
[03:03:07.216 --> 03:03:07.796]  Go ahead, Kyle.
[03:03:09.196 --> 03:03:10.117]  Alex, how are you, my friend?
[03:03:10.157 --> 03:03:10.637]  Good, go ahead.
[03:03:12.057 --> 03:03:13.258]  Alright, let's get right to it.
[03:03:13.278 --> 03:03:19.620]  So, about the censorship on the Internet, I think obviously it's great how it worked out, and I don't want to waste time thanking you, but you did a great job for Mark.
[03:03:20.060 --> 03:03:22.761]  But I think the real solution is, we've got to look at the problem
[03:03:23.504 --> 03:03:29.205]  It seems like what's starting to happen is they're kind of creating a mainstream media of the internet.
[03:03:29.445 --> 03:03:34.607]  Like some of these sites are becoming sort of institutions and really becoming entrenched and connected with the establishment.
[03:03:34.647 --> 03:03:36.487]  YouTube, Google, Facebook.
[03:03:36.847 --> 03:03:44.109]  No, other people could sue YouTube or threaten suits or injunctions the way I have and you'd get contacts through lawyers.
[03:03:45.429 --> 03:03:49.770]  You have to resist because if we keep the bigger sites up it defends the other sites.
[03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:52.271]  I try to defend all of it and I'm against it.
[03:03:54.138 --> 03:04:01.860]  Well, I agree with you, but what I'm saying is, is these sites are getting so, so big and having so much influence, and all it takes is for them to be bought off, and then we have a real problem.
[03:04:02.020 --> 03:04:02.620]  No, no, I agree.
[03:04:02.660 --> 03:04:04.780]  It's bad to just have a YouTube or a Facebook.
[03:04:04.860 --> 03:04:05.240]  I agree.
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:06.481]  We should have alternatives.
[03:04:06.941 --> 03:04:07.341]  And we do.
[03:04:07.741 --> 03:04:07.921]  Yeah.
[03:04:08.761 --> 03:04:19.283]  I totally agree, and like, that's why, and I'm going to take the responsibility on myself, including your listeners, but I think it would be smart for guys like you and Mark to maybe put... Yeah, we started PlanetInfoWars.com as a social network.
[03:04:19.323 --> 03:04:19.603]  It's there.
[03:04:19.663 --> 03:04:19.983]  Thank you.
[03:04:20.123 --> 03:04:20.604]  We're trying.
[03:04:21.004 --> 03:04:22.164]  Joe and Mayne, you're on the air.
[03:04:22.204 --> 03:04:22.524]  Go ahead.
[03:04:26.144 --> 03:04:28.886]  I just wanna, uh, let you know.
[03:04:29.346 --> 03:04:30.466]  You know guys, do you hear that?
[03:04:30.646 --> 03:04:31.387]  Hold on, I gotta let him go.
[03:04:31.407 --> 03:04:32.327]  I'm sorry, I'm out of time.
[03:04:32.347 --> 03:04:35.049]  Listen, almost every caller from me I can't hear.
[03:04:35.109 --> 03:04:37.790]  Everybody tells me it sounds good, but you guys are saying you heard that.
[03:04:37.810 --> 03:04:41.812]  I mean, it sounds like, SILENT RAIDERS ATTACK!
[03:04:41.872 --> 03:04:43.033]  SILENT RAIDERS ATTACK!
[03:04:43.353 --> 03:04:45.494]  WE HAVE COME FROM THE PLANET SNICKLESNORT!
[03:04:45.735 --> 03:04:47.255]  WE LOVE OBAMA, OUR LEADER!
[03:04:47.756 --> 03:04:52.718]  WE COME FROM A JELLYFISH COMMUNITY AS WELL OF PARASITES AND SPINELESS WORMS!
[03:04:56.738 --> 03:04:58.100]  All right, great job with the crew today.
[03:04:58.180 --> 03:04:59.903]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[03:04:59.963 --> 03:05:00.323]  to 2 p.m.
[03:05:00.343 --> 03:05:00.864]  Central.
[03:05:01.205 --> 03:05:06.873]  Nightly News tonight, I'll be co-hosting it with the crew, 7 o'clock Central, if you're watching this transmission or listening.
[03:05:07.193 --> 03:05:08.455]  You are the resistance!
[03:05:10.743 --> 03:05:16.509]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.
[03:05:16.709 --> 03:05:17.890]  We thank you for listening.
[03:05:18.070 --> 03:05:19.391]  Now, just imagine.
[03:05:19.451 --> 03:05:25.897]  Let's model to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[03:05:26.038 --> 03:05:31.443]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[03:05:31.683 --> 03:05:33.845]  These are items that I did research on.
[03:05:33.985 --> 03:05:34.245]  I think?
