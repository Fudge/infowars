[00:00:01.428 --> 00:00:04.731]  This is Jakari Jackson, InfoWars.com.
[00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:07.313]  I got a text this morning from Michael Cargill.
[00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.674]  He's pictured there in the red shirt.
[00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:19.543]  He's a regular contributor to our programming, saying that a very unstable individual came into his store seeking to purchase not only a firearm, but a good amount of ammunition.
[00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:22.285]  So I'll play this video and then I'll comment on it further.
[00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:29.231]  He asked for 500 rounds of full metal jacket, 500 rounds of ball, and 500 rounds of hollow point.
[00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:32.653]  And he wanted to purchase a firearm that was similar to this one, a SIG.
[00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:39.518]  Cargill says he kept an eye on him through the surveillance cameras and eventually came out to meet the man and give him paperwork for a background check.
[00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:42.240]  Before he fills out the paperwork, he tells me, you know, you know what?
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.821]  Just, you know, I want a gun.
[00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:44.822]  I want this SIG.
[00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:46.823]  And I want to make sure you guys have the ammunition for it.
[00:00:47.023 --> 00:00:50.166]  And I'm going to go over there to the hospital, and I'm going to shoot everyone in that hospital.
[00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.450]  And I said, OK.
[00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.992]  That's when Cargill presses the silent alarm.
[00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:58.154]  So the police come and they arrest the guy.
[00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:03.057]  And it's a good job by Michael Cargill and his crew over there at Central Texas Gun Works.
[00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:10.763]  But it just goes to show everybody says, we need all these measures for ammunition and firearms.
[00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:17.547]  But you can see clearly, a responsible gun store with competent employees refusing service to the man.
[00:01:17.587 --> 00:01:19.469]  They sold him no gun, no ammunition.
[00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.791]  And you know, the guy obviously had issues and they picked up on it.
[00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:30.593]  You know, they didn't even need to fill out a FBI or ATF background check to figure out if this guy has issues.
[00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:38.056]  So good job to Michael Cargill and his crew over there and I'm sure we'll have them on the show sometime in the near future to talk more about their situation.
