[00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:10.588]  The whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought.
[00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:15.551]  In the end, we'll make thought crime literally impossible because there'll be no words to express it.
[00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.172]  But even now, there's no excuse for thought crime.
[00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:19.913]  It's just a question of reality control, of self-discipline.
[00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:23.215]  When Newspeak is perfect and compulsory, there won't be the need even for that.
[00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:25.176]  The revolution will be complete.
[00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:30.832]  For 70 years or so, there's been nobody alive who could possibly understand this conversation we're having.
[00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:32.352]  Except the pros.
[00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:33.493]  They're not human.
[00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:38.354]  The trend towards mass media's hold on the American mind is losing its grip.
[00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:43.895]  Gallup polls show that on average, only 40% of Americans trust mass media.
[00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.156]  And the decrease has progressed since the mid-2000s.
[00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:55.225]  The re-election of George W. Bush hammered public trust from 54% in 2003 to 44% in 2004.
[00:00:56.466 --> 00:01:01.173]  Both ABC News and CBS News have siblings in the Obama administration.
[00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:06.540]  CBS News President David Rhodes and ABC News President
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:19.285]  Ben Sherwood, both of them have siblings that not only work at the White House, that not only work for President Obama, but they work at the NSC on foreign policy issues directly related to Benghazi.
[00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:24.206]  And no one batted an eye after former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.
[00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:28.148]  It's not because I'm a paragon of virtue, it's because that would be a terrible way to do the job.
[00:01:28.328 --> 00:01:38.594]  Who repeatedly pushed false talking points to the American public, and is married to an ABC senior correspondent, is now to be a trusted voice on CNN.
[00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:40.315]  Facts are stubborn things, Mr. Carney.
[00:01:40.335 --> 00:01:46.958]  Senator, I understand that you present the facts that you believe are true based on the arguments that you've made for a long time, sir.
[00:01:46.978 --> 00:01:52.841]  The Los Angeles Times reported that young people spend an average of 200 hours per month watching media.
[00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:55.303]  So why would trust decline?
[00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:59.965]  We mustn't be caught by surprise by our own advancing technology.
[00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:03.809]  I would feel it's being used too much to distract everybody all the time.
[00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:12.798]  But I mean, imagine, which must be the situation in all communist countries, where the television, where it exists, is always saying the same thing the whole time.
[00:02:12.858 --> 00:02:13.939]  It's always driving along.
[00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.822]  It's not creating a wide front of distraction.
[00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:18.424]  It's creating a one-pointed
[00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:19.819]  I think so.
[00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:35.893]  And his physiology even, making him actually love his slavery.
[00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:41.834]  Currently six corporations feed the public 90% of all the collectivized info it has to offer.
[00:02:42.114 --> 00:02:58.259]  For example, the lurid details of Stephen Collins' child molestation investigation are repeatedly broadcast across the media landscape, while reports of 418 North Carolina children being raped by illegal aliens in one month goes unreported.
[00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.782]  What matters most to the American people means very little to a politicized culture in the White House.
[00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:06.923]  It's an election year after all.
[00:03:07.323 --> 00:03:14.346]  The disengaged Obama administration's assumption that public perception is under controlled manipulation
[00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:20.030]  Only adds fuel to the downward spiral of trust contained in the Gallup poll numbers.
[00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:30.980]  In the words of Abraham Lincoln, you can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.
