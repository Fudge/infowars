[00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:03.251]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:07.194]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:15.672]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:17.373]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:19.214]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:20.675]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:22.357]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:26.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.304]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:43.013]  On Friday, President Obama came out and said, quote, people feel like the world is in crisis because of the media.
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.842]  A very simplistic statement.
[00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:48.783]  Partially true.
[00:00:49.023 --> 00:00:55.709]  The public is scared to swim because they think great white sharks are eating hundreds of people a day, not five a year.
[00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:06.859]  People are afraid of jihadis that are being protected by the government and allowed to attack the United States, but statistically still one of the rarest forms of death.
[00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:27.067]  But the mainstream media doesn't hype people up to scare them, say, about glyphosates in the water causing, on record, the massive increase in breast cancer that literally kills hundreds of thousands of people a year in the Western world alone.
[00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:45.432]  What the mainstream media is not doing is actually letting people know how globally the world is lining up for the type of events we saw in World War I and World War II, but magnified because of the changing technological landscape.
[00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:58.408]  I've been talking about this a lot the last few years, this big quickening that was coming, this geopolitical crisis.
[00:01:58.748 --> 00:02:17.377]  We'll have increased warfare, increased terrorism, increased asymmetrical warfare, increased financial instability, increased racial and religious tensions, increasing financial crises, environmental crises, because the political clash
[00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:27.345]  Has made the decision to exacerbate those problems and then pose as saviors to supposedly cure those problems to only gain more power.
[00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:30.748]  And there's been a mix of that throughout history.
[00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:35.773]  There's been different types of elites, some incredibly wicked and evil, some altruistic as everyone knows.
[00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:39.117]  But this time there's a perfect storm of
[00:02:41.024 --> 00:02:57.130]  Delusion and decadence and arrogance, not just by the elites, but by the general population of the planet as well, that is creating a witch's brew perfect storm cascade.
[00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:01.832]  And I say I've been talking about this for a couple of years.
[00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:04.193]  I've been talking about it for 20 years on air.
[00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:07.714]  Just about 20 years in about a month.
[00:03:07.794 --> 00:03:08.915]  It'll be 20 years I've been on air.
[00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:29.153]  But I've been talking about it intensely for 18, but even more intensely the last two, and suddenly you see the British Ministry of Defense and the Pentagon and all these other major systems saying prepare for it as well, that it's an inevitability, not just a possibility.
[00:03:30.573 --> 00:03:38.636]  And by and large, the Pentagon and Ministry of Defense and police departments and others are not guilty really of anything.
[00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:54.451]  When it comes to creating the crises, they are then tasked with cleaning up the crisis, which again is another power grab for the establishment.
[00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:58.474]  But it's kind of like a billy club going upside your head or a baseball bat for no reason.
[00:03:59.074 --> 00:04:05.320]  It may not be guilty itself, but it doesn't matter, it's still the instrument of the destruction.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:19.996]  And our biggest problem we face as a species is the complexity of the world and the fact that the establishment has created such centralized compartmentalization.
[00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.302]  You add that to a decadent cycle.
[00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.361]  That is obviously intensifying.
[00:04:30.222 --> 00:04:40.972]  We're in the very bottom of a decadence cycle, that if it cascades into a deeper cycle of decadence, it will just be beyond Rome before it's collapsed.
[00:04:41.713 --> 00:04:42.533]  We're already getting there.
[00:04:43.735 --> 00:04:50.921]  But we could bottom out, have a soft landing in my view, and get out of this, and really have a new
[00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:53.386]  We're good to go.
[00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:10.405]  Another major health threat.
[00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:15.327]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:05:15.407 --> 00:05:18.049]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:24.852]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:05:25.132 --> 00:05:27.994]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:31.055]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:33.056]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:05:33.076 --> 00:05:35.918]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:05:35.998 --> 00:05:41.519]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:45.220]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.221]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:48.153]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:06:48.253 --> 00:06:49.254]  Talk about the effects.
[00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:51.055]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:53.075]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:54.056]  I feel like I look better.
[00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:54.756]  I feel better.
[00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:55.896]  I feel sexier.
[00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:56.617]  I love it.
[00:06:56.857 --> 00:06:59.778]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:06:59.838 --> 00:07:02.579]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:03.819]  Check it out for yourself.

[00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:08.361]  This is life changing.
[00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:14.883]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:19.205]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:07:19.645 --> 00:07:24.229]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:27.231]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:32.736]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:07:32.996 --> 00:07:39.881]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:07:40.382 --> 00:07:44.145]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:45.206]  Nobody else.
[00:07:45.626 --> 00:07:49.288]  ...has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:58.054]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[00:08:25.384 --> 00:08:31.266]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:45.131]  Every time that I look in the mirror, all these lines in my face get clearer.
[00:08:45.772 --> 00:08:47.492]  The past is gone.
[00:08:47.672 --> 00:08:49.333]  The past is gone.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.401]  Here are the headlines.
[00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:57.382]  Humanoid robots to hit stores.
[00:08:59.224 --> 00:09:02.547]  CDC director, Ebola outbreak spiraling out of control.
[00:09:02.687 --> 00:09:03.788]  That's a quote.
[00:09:04.488 --> 00:09:06.890]  Going to get worse in the very near future.
[00:09:09.212 --> 00:09:09.533]  U.S.
[00:09:09.573 --> 00:09:11.154]  prepares for Ebola outbreak.
[00:09:11.234 --> 00:09:14.817]  Cases may exceed 100,000 by December.
[00:09:15.698 --> 00:09:17.559]  The numbers are really scary.
[00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:22.464]  The deadly contagion continues to sprint.
[00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:38.039]  And I'm going to say it again, they had major scientific reports out two years ago in major scientific publications confirming African studies carried out by the West where Ebola is airborne.
[00:09:41.621 --> 00:09:49.086]  It is airborne in sneeze droplets or spit droplets, sinus droplets.
[00:09:50.683 --> 00:09:55.966]  It has been transferred between pigs and monkeys through the air.
[00:09:57.266 --> 00:10:07.632]  And it's believed from the beginning it comes from bats flying around, basically crapping in the air, excuse my French, and that people and animals are breathing it.
[00:10:08.152 --> 00:10:09.753]  But you've got to have it go directly in.
[00:10:10.613 --> 00:10:11.894]  There's a spectrum of airborne.
[00:10:11.914 --> 00:10:15.516]  You've got stuff that can live in the air for a long time, like fungus and things.
[00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:17.557]  It can live weeks, if not months.
[00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:19.617]  Sometimes longer.
[00:10:20.197 --> 00:10:27.979]  They believe the curse of the pharaohs where so many explorers go in and discover a tomb and then two weeks later are dead from respiratory problems.
[00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:31.440]  Or you can have multi-thousand year old deadly fungus in there.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:39.722]  That our current population is not prepared for and has never experienced so it's lethal.
[00:10:41.982 --> 00:10:42.803]  Now that's airborne.
[00:10:43.923 --> 00:10:45.623]  When you've got three thousand year old fungus.
[00:10:47.784 --> 00:10:48.384]  Killing people.
[00:10:50.447 --> 00:11:06.810]  Ebola only survives a matter of seconds unless it's in microscopic nasal fluid or lung fluid being coughed up into the air.
[00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:10.891]  But I've seen very little mainstream media coverage of this.
[00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:13.112]  I know Paul Watson wrote about it a few weeks ago.
[00:11:13.152 --> 00:11:19.433]  We probably need to write about it again and just say, why won't the media point out that Ebola is beginning to go airborne?
[00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:23.620]  And it appears to be mutating and becoming stronger.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.201]  They've said that.
[00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:34.969]  It now gestates or goes through its incubation period over a much longer period of time, allowing it to spread much more readily before the symptoms show up.
[00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:38.412]  It's a very big deal.
[00:11:41.138 --> 00:11:56.601]  Though news on Ebola virus has been muted since two American healthcare workers were admitted to US-based facilities last month, the deadly continues to spread according to the World Health Organization, with more than 40% of all Ebola cases thus far have occurred in just the last three months.
[00:11:57.182 --> 00:11:57.822]  You understand that?
[00:11:59.542 --> 00:12:00.382]  That's of all time.
[00:12:00.822 --> 00:12:03.323]  Suggesting the virus is continuing to build steam.
[00:12:05.609 --> 00:12:14.619]  Physicists at Northwestern University in Boston and other researchers are trying to figure out how far Ebola may spread and how many people around the world could be affected.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:21.908]  Based on its findings, there will be 10,000 cases by September of this year, and it only gets worse from there.
[00:12:21.928 --> 00:12:25.292]  We're going to be talking about that sum today.
[00:12:27.773 --> 00:12:32.477]  But don't worry, Bill and Melinda Gates have been working on a vaccine for it.
[00:12:33.197 --> 00:12:40.603]  And let me tell you, if Ebola goes really airborne and starts killing a bunch of people, I would want to take a vaccine, even if it was risky, to try to protect myself.
[00:12:40.683 --> 00:12:53.954]  The problem is, you can't go to certified evil government and certified evil organizations that have been caught not once, not twice, but thousands of times jacking with vaccines and other medicines.
[00:12:54.704 --> 00:13:01.906]  Then they always go, you people are anti-science, while you can get artificial immunity from vaccines.
[00:13:01.946 --> 00:13:03.326]  No, we know that.
[00:13:04.387 --> 00:13:05.667]  We're not Fred Flintstone.
[00:13:05.687 --> 00:13:10.248]  In fact, you're playing on the ignorant public out there.
[00:13:11.168 --> 00:13:12.409]  We read the inserts.
[00:13:13.664 --> 00:13:18.226]  On the polio vaccine, on the hepatitis vaccine, on the Gardasil vaccine.
[00:13:18.627 --> 00:13:22.188]  We know all of them kill a percentage of people that take it.
[00:13:22.709 --> 00:13:24.389]  All sorts of autoimmune disorders.
[00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.912]  We know the anthrax shots they gave the troops in three different rounds killed hundreds of them, sickened tens of thousands.
[00:13:30.673 --> 00:13:39.177]  It's all on record that A. they don't care what's in the vaccines and B. they're putting things in them.
[00:13:40.657 --> 00:13:52.185]  This is a government, I'm going to say it again, that for 47, 48 years gave black people vaccines that were really syphilis.
[00:13:52.805 --> 00:13:54.026]  And first when Tuskegee broke,
[00:13:58.183 --> 00:14:02.185]  They were like, oh, we let black people have it and then let them spread it and didn't treat them.
[00:14:02.525 --> 00:14:06.326]  And then it was like, oh, we actually let some of them, you know, actually contract it, we would give it to them.
[00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:11.688]  And then, oh, actually it started, well, you know, we had to have a controlled sample so we would give it to the blacks in the local clinics.
[00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:13.709]  And it's just unbelievable, folks.
[00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:25.774]  And the reason the scientific technocrats did that to black people, poor Appalachian whites, and Native Americans,
[00:14:26.823 --> 00:14:29.405]  Was because they were poor and nobody would listen to them.
[00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:36.750]  The globalist, the eugenicist, would have done it to everybody if they thought they could get away with it, and now they do.
[00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:51.541]  In fact, it's mainly upper middle class people that run out and get their daughters the multi-thousand dollar, it's over $1,500 last time I checked, three round Gardasil shot.
[00:14:52.622 --> 00:14:56.085]  And all these soccer moms drive up in their Mercedes, they take their daughter in,
[00:14:57.503 --> 00:15:04.906]  And they get the first round and then the girl's in bed for a week with a headache and blood on the brain and, you know, loses 10-15 IQ points.
[00:15:05.326 --> 00:15:07.527]  But mama takes them back in and slams them again.
[00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:17.190]  And then usually by the second round they have such bad epileptic seizures that a lot of moms get smart and don't give them the third round.
[00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:19.571]  And it's a goodly percentage.
[00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:25.613]  It's a small percentage, but it's a good percentage that end up dying or having autoimmune disorders and epilepsy and narcolepsy.
[00:15:25.994 --> 00:15:26.694]  I know people
[00:15:28.148 --> 00:15:29.369]  Who went and got the Gardasil?
[00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.709]  Women.
[00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:33.110]  Who now can't drive because they have narcolepsy.
[00:15:34.451 --> 00:15:37.552]  And then one of the women I know, I know two women that have told me about this.
[00:15:37.852 --> 00:15:38.673]  They've known for years.
[00:15:39.713 --> 00:15:45.195]  Another one now is developing epilepsy at like, I think, 34 years old.
[00:15:46.816 --> 00:15:48.557]  No epilepsy in her family, it's not genetic.
[00:15:50.718 --> 00:15:54.820]  I know two talk show hosts in Austin that took
[00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:03.372]  The H1N1 vaccine five years ago, and both of them got their hands and feet totally numb.
[00:16:04.452 --> 00:16:07.313]  One of them, the feeling hasn't come back five years later.
[00:16:16.877 --> 00:16:23.599]  And they went to their doctor and the doctor said, oh yeah, you've got Guillain-Barré from the vaccine.
[00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:28.408]  And this talk show host, I've been on their show many times, I'm not gonna even say their name.
[00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.752]  I told them not to take it, and it still happened.
[00:16:37.615 --> 00:16:40.036]  I gotta try to get that talk show host on and just debate him about it.
[00:16:40.697 --> 00:16:45.920]  Because a lot of times, people, once something bad happens to them, they double down again, believing in the system.
[00:16:50.744 --> 00:16:52.345]  And within this whole vaccine debate,
[00:16:54.912 --> 00:17:10.935]  It's just a case point example for everything else because we know fluoride causes massive IQ reduction, seven-fold increase in bone cancer in men and boys, increased pancreatic cancer, increased bladder cancer, bone cancer, I already mentioned that.
[00:17:11.855 --> 00:17:14.056]  Just literally hundreds of things.
[00:17:14.316 --> 00:17:18.616]  It's the worst thing you could take that doesn't kill you pretty much immediately.
[00:17:22.912 --> 00:17:27.837]  There's hundreds of other chemicals that they add under the name of fluoride and it's a fact.
[00:17:28.257 --> 00:17:32.481]  It's an absolute, total, incontrovertible fact.
[00:17:35.384 --> 00:17:42.231]  And I know all sorts of Democratic Party elites here in Austin through a family connection.
[00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:51.106]  And they will literally laugh at you and pour tap water and say, I love my tap water.
[00:17:51.186 --> 00:17:52.166]  They've done studies.
[00:17:52.246 --> 00:17:55.747]  It tastes better than bottled, which all those studies are completely fake.
[00:17:56.647 --> 00:17:57.208]  It's come out.
[00:17:57.228 --> 00:17:59.708]  I mean, we've gone out with real filtered water versus tap water.
[00:18:00.349 --> 00:18:03.450]  Almost every person wants the filtered water and says it tastes better.
[00:18:07.811 --> 00:18:11.172]  But it's a religious sacrament.
[00:18:12.872 --> 00:18:14.033]  It's a religious
[00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:17.012]  Belief in the state.
[00:18:17.172 --> 00:18:24.594]  And that's what Obama and Joe Biden and John Kerry... We've got to get these clips together and put them all together.
[00:18:24.614 --> 00:18:29.015]  And they say, believe, keep the faith, stay with us, stay with government.
[00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:31.776]  It's not some bad tyranny around the corner.
[00:18:32.136 --> 00:18:32.896]  Believe in it.
[00:18:33.396 --> 00:18:34.657]  It's going to deliver.
[00:18:36.477 --> 00:18:38.338]  Keep the faith, is a Catholic saying.
[00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:47.030]  They are now reduced to literally saying, keep the faith, government is the religion.
[00:18:51.492 --> 00:18:54.953]  And for people that believe in the system and have worked in it so far, it has delivered.
[00:18:55.693 --> 00:19:02.496]  But it's also delivered an empty, soulless culture of dependent people, both in the governing and corporate, but also welfare class.
[00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:09.458]  It's created a system based on fraud and graft and connections and insider deals, not on real production.
[00:19:11.613 --> 00:19:13.834]  We're going to talk about the cloud coming up.
[00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:23.619]  That if you can hack the cloud, you can get, if it's the Apple cloud, I think they were saying just the United States, there's something like 70 million people on it.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.682]  People are always saying with my iPhone, you want to be on the cloud, you could store more photos and videos.
[00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:29.602]  I'm like, no.
[00:19:29.622 --> 00:19:34.165]  I don't want people having access to that.
[00:19:36.209 --> 00:19:37.429]  Oh, you don't know anything about tech.
[00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:50.874]  So now, Kate Upton and the rest of them, and the Hunger Games lady, their naked sex pictures and stuff are reportedly... I didn't go look at it, one of my friends did.
[00:19:50.894 --> 00:19:51.734]  He said it's pretty wild.
[00:19:52.134 --> 00:19:53.835]  The Kate Upton stuff, a bunch of it.
[00:19:55.375 --> 00:19:56.536]  And, I mean, what did you think?
[00:19:56.576 --> 00:20:05.519]  You stored videos with your boyfriends, and stuff that you shot, on the cloud, up on big giant, basically NSA servers.
[00:20:07.048 --> 00:20:08.255]  Any year that you thought those were safe.
[00:20:09.558 --> 00:20:17.364]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.
[00:20:17.704 --> 00:20:21.327]  Stay one step ahead of hackers and Big Brother with a BlockIt Pocket.

[00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:43.649]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[00:20:43.829 --> 00:20:45.970]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.650]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.972]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.192]  KD Armor is standing up for you.

[00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:08.816]  Question.
[00:21:09.176 --> 00:21:13.419]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:21:13.959 --> 00:21:14.820]  Answer, yes.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:21.003]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Teriganics.

[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.361]  Pro-EM1 from Terragonics.
[00:21:58.381 --> 00:21:59.361]  Life's getting better.
[00:22:08.095 --> 00:22:13.340]  Recent events have shown just how vulnerable we are to deadly viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.025]  These diseases are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[00:22:19.345 --> 00:22:23.168]  Now, more than ever, there's a great need for a product that will help protect us.
[00:22:23.528 --> 00:22:24.369]  Look no further.
[00:22:24.749 --> 00:22:29.574]  Supernatural Silver can provide immune system support to help fight off these deadly pathogens.
[00:22:30.174 --> 00:22:40.966]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that's safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast.

[00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:45.851]  Another major health threat
[00:23:08.677 --> 00:23:13.582]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:16.304]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:23:16.324 --> 00:23:23.111]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:23:23.371 --> 00:23:26.233]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:23:26.354 --> 00:23:29.276]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:23:29.296 --> 00:23:31.298]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:23:31.338 --> 00:23:34.201]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:23:34.241 --> 00:23:39.763]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:23:39.983 --> 00:23:43.465]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:23:43.485 --> 00:23:46.466]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:23:46.566 --> 00:23:50.708]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[00:23:50.728 --> 00:23:53.089]  Come, you masters of war Hear the bell of the big guns
[00:24:20.748 --> 00:24:23.790]  Here's what's happening.
[00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:38.498]  Humanity has developed unbelievably powerful technologies on so many fronts that are being turned towards control, turned towards social manipulation.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.863]  And according to DARPA, who invented the internet and set up the modern infrastructure we live under,
[00:24:49.448 --> 00:25:00.553]  Within just a few years, devices are coming out where they won't store data natively, or very little, you'll be forced onto a cloud-like system.
[00:25:03.014 --> 00:25:12.678]  Cloud computing, headed up by Amazon, Google, and Apple, Oracle, Cisco, and others,
[00:25:15.237 --> 00:25:21.741]  Openly admits that they're co-housing their servers with the NSA and the CIA.
[00:25:24.062 --> 00:25:31.186]  And that Microsoft has basically been part of the intelligence combine since its founding along with IBM.
[00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:42.052]  So when I talk about hundreds of stars having their photos grabbed by a hacker who was able to break into the Apple Cloud,
[00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:49.473]  It's a fact that these systems make us insecure, not secure.
[00:25:50.434 --> 00:25:59.279]  All you had to do was get into the cloud, search by their names, find their accounts, and download it.
[00:26:04.022 --> 00:26:06.243]  And I have nothing to hide on my cell phone.
[00:26:06.283 --> 00:26:09.966]  It's like photos of my children and sunsets and things like that.
[00:26:10.006 --> 00:26:13.588]  But if you don't turn off the function, it geolocates every photo.
[00:26:15.123 --> 00:26:19.726]  It tells people where you're at when you take a photo, if you tweet it, if you don't go remove that function.
[00:26:20.386 --> 00:26:23.348]  Imagine what that does for thieves and criminals and governments, see?
[00:26:23.768 --> 00:26:42.439]  And it was all built just like, if you go back more than 15, 16 years ago, MIT, DARPA, the Department of Transportation, and the same thing in Europe and Asia, all standardized, would have these big meetings in London and Chicago and Sydney.
[00:26:43.983 --> 00:26:45.225]  We're good to go.
[00:27:02.372 --> 00:27:18.904]  How all the cars would have a standardized GPS tracking to tax you and track you by the mile, and then I watched them phase it in, put the boxes in the last five years globally, and now they're passing regulations to make it the law to tax you by the mile.
[00:27:20.466 --> 00:27:21.246]  It's all happening!
[00:27:21.847 --> 00:27:29.713]  And I'm gonna say it again, all premeditated, all decided by global governance corporate boards that are unelected.
[00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:40.808]  Just like the Trans-Pacific partnerships, the North American partnerships, the EU partnerships all start as trade deals and then pretty soon they're running the countries and the countries have no power.
[00:27:42.329 --> 00:27:45.972]  And then what does the EU and global governance model do and has control of you?
[00:27:46.892 --> 00:27:52.616]  Paul Watson did a video report on this yesterday that was very powerful that I want to get and play in the next segment.
[00:27:54.158 --> 00:27:58.761]  EU to ban toasters and vacuum cleaners because of quote global warming.
[00:28:00.009 --> 00:28:02.492]  And put a tax on all the others you buy at the store.
[00:28:03.293 --> 00:28:04.214]  Now why would they do that?
[00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:06.376]  Because it's about control.
[00:28:06.777 --> 00:28:13.765]  If they can tell you that you can't have a vacuum cleaner, I mean they're cutting them down where the vacuum cleaner won't even clean.
[00:28:14.546 --> 00:28:16.188]  They can push you back to the Stone Age.
[00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:21.925]  And then government districts get a load of this, they get waivers on it.
[00:28:22.705 --> 00:28:25.465]  It's about controlling technology at its source.
[00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:38.548]  It's about setting precedence that we tell you how big your toilet is, what type of light bulbs you get, how big your yard can be, how many kids you can have, how many times you can go on vacation, how much beef you can have.
[00:28:38.808 --> 00:28:43.729]  This is all their plannedopolis model on record from their own words.
[00:28:45.469 --> 00:28:48.991]  Where from cradle to grave, social workers will run our lives.
[00:28:53.054 --> 00:28:53.574]  And it's here.
[00:28:57.477 --> 00:28:58.358]  And it's premeditated.
[00:29:00.119 --> 00:29:07.884]  And I get up here on air and say, don't let the Department of Transportation or Obama, with an executive order, start the forced taxation of cars by the mile.
[00:29:10.906 --> 00:29:12.988]  And people just say, that doesn't exist, it'll never happen.
[00:29:13.388 --> 00:29:14.789]  And we'll never get Obamacare either.
[00:29:19.534 --> 00:29:23.155]  We'll never, ever see Obama just legalize all the illegals by fiat.
[00:29:23.475 --> 00:29:23.955]  Already done it.
[00:29:26.876 --> 00:29:33.158]  We have to wake up that we have bad people who have bad plans for us and our families in charge.
[00:29:33.458 --> 00:29:37.499]  I'm gonna come back and just go through huge news on the Middle East.
[00:29:37.959 --> 00:29:40.960]  Absolutely huge.
[00:29:44.494 --> 00:29:47.256]  Where Al-Qaeda is basically attacking all over the world.
[00:29:47.656 --> 00:29:49.377]  From Pakistan to Somalia.
[00:29:51.398 --> 00:29:52.999]  From Egypt to Iraq.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.021]  And now they're saying they're getting ready to hit Texas.
[00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:57.682]  We'll break it down straight ahead.
[00:29:58.323 --> 00:29:59.243]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.724 --> 00:30:01.325]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.265 --> 00:30:04.967]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:15.724]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:15.945 --> 00:30:20.128]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:25.053]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:30:25.473 --> 00:30:28.074]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:30:28.394 --> 00:30:33.576]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:30:33.836 --> 00:30:40.718]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:30:41.218 --> 00:30:44.999]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:50.141]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:50.461 --> 00:30:51.321]  This is innovating.
[00:30:51.601 --> 00:30:58.906]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:30:59.086 --> 00:31:03.169]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:31:14.823 --> 00:31:21.009]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:29.398]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.

[00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:01.731]  Open your eyes.
[00:32:09.218 --> 00:32:12.719]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:12.859 --> 00:32:16.820]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.600]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:26.502]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:32:26.782 --> 00:32:27.623]  But for how long?
[00:32:27.923 --> 00:32:34.184]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:32:34.564 --> 00:32:37.365]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:32:39.335 --> 00:32:46.219]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:33:12.612 --> 00:33:14.113]  We are on the march.
[00:33:14.473 --> 00:33:16.913]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:17.634 --> 00:33:21.335]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:33.797 --> 00:33:47.820]  I'm gonna try to say this as clearly as I can for new listeners who may have tuned in for the first time in Los Angeles or Oklahoma City or other cities where we have new affiliates.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:34:01.182]  I am trying to bring hope to the situation, but the only hope we have, I'm not trying to be scary or negative here, the only hope we have
[00:34:02.893 --> 00:34:25.038]  is realizing in our gut and in our minds intellectually, deep down, that the social engineers that are running our globe, the technocrats, have it out for us, on record, and have built the civilization that we're living in.
[00:34:25.078 --> 00:34:31.239]  They've basically hijacked what our forebears built, what we built, and they've built into it
[00:34:32.645 --> 00:34:42.331]  Multivariate, multifaceted, Trojan horse systems of domination, degradation, control, physical and mental illness.
[00:34:43.772 --> 00:34:54.058]  They are carrying out a soft-kill war developed by British, German, and US eugenicists more than a hundred years ago.
[00:34:54.538 --> 00:34:58.801]  If you don't know what a social engineer is, if you don't know what eugenics is,
[00:35:00.808 --> 00:35:05.074]  It's what governs everything, not fantasy football, not tailgating.
[00:35:06.376 --> 00:35:13.867]  And I like a good tailgate with some brisket and a cold drink as much as anybody.
[00:35:15.953 --> 00:35:24.355]  But that's the average man's God, is just go to work, make money, go home, watch TV, watch SportsCenter, have a good time.
[00:35:24.715 --> 00:35:27.515]  Okay, well then don't have kids then, if you have that attitude, okay?
[00:35:27.755 --> 00:35:30.496]  Because they want to shoot your kids up with a bunch of poisonous vaccines.
[00:35:31.176 --> 00:35:35.117]  You're being socially, genetically, and mentally manipulated.
[00:35:35.877 --> 00:35:41.318]  The GMO kills the lab animals in every major test out there, or mutates them.
[00:35:42.657 --> 00:35:46.178]  You're living in a science fiction movie is what I'm trying to get across to you.
[00:35:46.498 --> 00:35:47.239]  Not my opinion.
[00:35:48.439 --> 00:35:51.760]  And they kept saying drones will replace all military by 2025.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.621]  And now they're like, oh, by 2020.
[00:35:54.861 --> 00:35:55.482]  Oh, now by 2018.
[00:35:55.642 --> 00:35:58.223]  They always tell you it's coming off the future.
[00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:01.124]  Then suddenly, today, the headlines hit everywhere.
[00:36:01.444 --> 00:36:03.545]  Humanoid robots to hit the stores.
[00:36:04.045 --> 00:36:06.466]  Japan unveils fastest two-legged robot in the world.
[00:36:09.127 --> 00:36:12.308]  Those stories are up on DrudgeReport.com and they're on Infowars.com.
[00:36:14.107 --> 00:36:15.208]  But that's what we're talking about.
[00:36:15.248 --> 00:36:19.029]  It's all just being rolled out now by, oh gee, well, you know what?
[00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.611]  We are watching everything you do and controlling it.
[00:36:24.692 --> 00:36:31.736]  But Homeland Security's lost track of 6,000 foreigners on student visas who were listed as dangerous.
[00:36:36.246 --> 00:36:39.609]  And now a British company is invading the U.S.
[00:36:40.209 --> 00:36:48.535]  with crowdsourcing political campaigns where they claim it's all grassroots, but they'll push with the media, the ones they want to promote, to even give more money.
[00:36:48.795 --> 00:36:58.542]  And Obama has come out and said, yes, Democrats, average Democrat, give us money, and then you will outdo the special interests.
[00:36:58.582 --> 00:36:59.983]  No, they'll just take your money as well.
[00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:04.287]  Joe Biden has come out and said, we're going to play the clip coming up,
[00:37:05.208 --> 00:37:06.609]  Let's take America back.
[00:37:06.929 --> 00:37:10.972]  You know, when Republicans or Libertarians say that, they claim it's code for racist.
[00:37:13.013 --> 00:37:18.037]  Of course, if you say death panels are horrible and point out where they are in the bill, they go, that's racist too.
[00:37:18.417 --> 00:37:20.118]  But see, that's 1984.
[00:37:20.558 --> 00:37:22.580]  When they use that term, it's okay.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.241]  Take America back?
[00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:28.701]  The Democratic Party has run this country since its inception.
[00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:33.624]  The Democratic Party basically founded the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:37:34.344 --> 00:37:36.625]  The Democratic Party runs this nation.
[00:37:36.905 --> 00:37:41.428]  The Republican just plays second fiddle as a placeholder and fake opposition.
[00:37:42.068 --> 00:37:43.349]  I mean, you are the president.
[00:37:43.649 --> 00:37:45.910]  You've had the Senate and for a while the House.
[00:37:46.551 --> 00:37:47.631]  You've got the governors.
[00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:49.012]  You've got everything.
[00:37:50.444 --> 00:38:06.379]  So, you do run things with the dollar devaluation, and the corporate welfare, and the society breaking down, and the idea with their lean forward, that's a Leninist, Karl Marxian, even predates Lenin, but that's a Lenin slogan, lean forward.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.802]  This is how dumb they think you are.
[00:38:09.102 --> 00:38:11.645]  Your children belong to the state, you didn't build your business!
[00:38:13.723 --> 00:38:15.483]  Lean forward.
[00:38:15.743 --> 00:38:20.904]  For anyone who studied history, this is so over the top, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:25.905 --> 00:38:26.786]  It's Twilight Zone.
[00:38:28.146 --> 00:38:30.966]  And the scientific dictators openly write in their own books.
[00:38:31.126 --> 00:38:32.567]  They do this because it works.
[00:38:33.147 --> 00:38:35.407]  We follow the same patterns over and over again.
[00:38:35.707 --> 00:38:38.568]  So I'm just basically here watching us go over the edge of a cliff.
[00:38:42.270 --> 00:39:01.240]  Watching the preparations for civil war, watching the preparations to let Al Qaeda, now rebranded IS, attack the United States and Europe, and then they'll just build up the paramilitary forces and the police, and then point them at gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, the Tea Party.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.062]  And I told you that 12, 13 years ago.
[00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:05.643]  I told you that six years ago.
[00:39:05.723 --> 00:39:06.783]  I told you that a month ago.
[00:39:07.083 --> 00:39:08.564]  You now notice it's all happening.
[00:39:09.685 --> 00:39:11.406]  Because I've learned their algorithm.
[00:39:12.452 --> 00:39:14.213]  I've learned how the globalists operate.
[00:39:18.537 --> 00:39:25.943]  One year ago, over 75% of Americans, we have the polls today, Steve Watson wrote an article about it at Infowars.com.
[00:39:27.466 --> 00:39:45.554]  Where almost 80% of Americans, depending on the polls, some were higher, I say 75, 76, that was the average poll, was a bunch of them, was against aiding Al-Qaeda in overthrowing Syria because the narrative got out through this show and through others and then Senator Paul, Senator Cruz and others that we don't want to be Al-Qaeda's air force.
[00:39:45.754 --> 00:39:49.115]  The military rebelled and that was a magic moment.
[00:39:49.175 --> 00:39:50.496]  I just got chills, I really did.
[00:39:51.636 --> 00:39:52.897]  A magic moment.
[00:39:54.599 --> 00:40:00.604]  Well, when they finally called that off and General Dempsey went and said there's going to be a military rebellion, we will not back Al-Qaeda, I cried.
[00:40:01.304 --> 00:40:02.625]  And I rarely cry, folks.
[00:40:02.685 --> 00:40:05.067]  I literally didn't boo-hoo like somebody died.
[00:40:05.087 --> 00:40:06.148]  It was tears of joy.
[00:40:06.248 --> 00:40:15.816]  I was smiling in the car, leaning on the steering wheel, driving in traffic, wracked with joy that we could be a moral nation again, we could turn the tide.
[00:40:15.856 --> 00:40:19.959]  We'll never be perfect, but try to be good, try to be honest, try to be on the right side of history.
[00:40:20.359 --> 00:40:23.662]  And it was such a Death Star destruction level event, I cried.
[00:40:24.909 --> 00:40:32.135]  Bigger than when we got the secret UN documents that it's really all about carbon taxes and eugenics and destroying the third world.
[00:40:32.356 --> 00:40:37.560]  When we got that secret document, it was confirmed to be authentic, and we basically broke it here on the air with Lord Monckton.
[00:40:38.461 --> 00:40:41.083]  I didn't cry, I actually had the guys go get champagne.
[00:40:41.324 --> 00:40:42.325]  We had champagne on air.
[00:40:42.625 --> 00:40:48.130]  And you watch, that crippled their whole carbon tax operation that's still alive, but barely.
[00:40:49.252 --> 00:40:51.133]  It was like the Death Star blowing up.
[00:40:51.994 --> 00:40:56.538]  I know, you're excited when your team wins the finals or semifinals or wins the Rose Bowl.
[00:40:56.638 --> 00:40:59.780]  I understand.
[00:41:00.621 --> 00:41:07.746]  But when we're toe-to-toe against you Genesis, sworn to destroy us, and we have major devastating victories against them, I want to celebrate them.
[00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:11.349]  The enemy is not going to celebrate these victories for us.
[00:41:12.443 --> 00:41:16.984]  It is a celebration that we reach 20 million people a week on all the different platforms we have.
[00:41:17.584 --> 00:41:27.486]  It's a celebration that we dominate Boxee and Roku and iTunes and hundreds of other platforms that we're on, where people can vote with just clicking.
[00:41:27.947 --> 00:41:29.727]  A true vote in the market of ideas.
[00:41:30.787 --> 00:41:32.588]  I'm not bragging about us, I'm giving you the good news.
[00:41:33.088 --> 00:41:34.148]  It is a true victory.
[00:41:35.558 --> 00:41:44.541]  That so-called alternative news sites that were called tabloid and all this other bull by dinosaur state-run media are now the dominant media in their constellation.
[00:41:45.421 --> 00:41:52.963]  And by that, together in our groups, promoting liberty, promoting real news, real ideas, doesn't mean we even all agree with each other.
[00:41:53.543 --> 00:41:59.145]  An InfoWars.com, a WorldNetDaily, a DrudgeReport.com, a Blaze, whatever.
[00:42:00.379 --> 00:42:19.690]  Even though none of us are perfect or have all the answers, together, the marketplace of ideas, the listeners, the commenters, the people, the guest, is creating a alternative to the establishment that is closer to reality by light years than what the establishment's putting out, who's trying to deceive.
[00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:23.673]  I was on the elliptical for 45 minutes this morning.
[00:42:25.063 --> 00:42:29.887]  And I was watching MSNBC, monitoring state-run media, literally, and it is a chore.
[00:42:29.927 --> 00:42:30.467]  It was work.
[00:42:31.428 --> 00:42:45.218]  With the audio off, just reading the text, because if I look at the fake, narcissistic, confidence faces they're making that they get coached on, with dumbed-down masks, just looking confident is all that matters, with their victims that watch them.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.021]  So I read the text.
[00:42:49.101 --> 00:42:50.983]  I don't look at their faces.
[00:42:52.366 --> 00:42:57.873]  Because to watch them premeditatedly perched on the public, feeding on everyone, makes you want to throw up.
[00:42:59.075 --> 00:43:01.979]  But I was sitting there and just seeing how they do it.
[00:43:03.942 --> 00:43:05.984]  Well, this is going to make Latinos mad!
[00:43:07.856 --> 00:43:10.458]  Obama is going to wait until after the midterm elections.
[00:43:10.698 --> 00:43:17.843]  He promised by the end of August to take executive action to legalize them by fiat and to stop deportations.
[00:43:18.643 --> 00:43:19.624]  But he didn't do that.
[00:43:19.704 --> 00:43:25.008]  Well, it's probably a good calculation because we can get more done later, you know, if we don't do this.
[00:43:25.608 --> 00:43:29.691]  Within that 30 seconds was just every word was a lie.
[00:43:30.151 --> 00:43:37.556]  Everything they said was a preposition propaganda point to reassert other mindless base propaganda.
[00:43:40.168 --> 00:43:53.440]  First off, the idea that if you're a, quote, Latino, set to be, within five years, the majority in the United States, already the majority and under the age of 15, it's your country.
[00:43:54.481 --> 00:44:00.887]  You really want it to be socialist or globalist, but they, if you want to take it from a racial position, it's your country.
[00:44:02.808 --> 00:44:03.409]  You understand that?
[00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:13.996]  But see, they can sell, oh, no, no, it's your country when you sign on to gun control, socialism, and open borders with a collapsing Latin America that everyone's trying to flee.
[00:44:14.256 --> 00:44:16.158]  So here, let's turn it into that completely.
[00:44:16.378 --> 00:44:18.599]  Let's politically adopt what did that there.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:24.643]  Devaluation of the currencies, paramilitary police, it just, it goes from there.
[00:44:26.845 --> 00:44:29.967]  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, just right down to Z.
[00:44:35.723 --> 00:44:36.824]  Number one lie.
[00:44:37.865 --> 00:44:40.107]  See, every two or three words was a lie.
[00:44:41.248 --> 00:44:42.710]  Latinos are going to be angry.
[00:44:43.530 --> 00:45:00.186]  Again, reasserting, repositioning, reapplying that if you're, quote, Latino, we're going to tell you how to think, and you are going to support the Democratic Party, and you're going to support the North American Union, and you're going to support an open end to this country.
[00:45:02.128 --> 00:45:08.051]  With whatever we want to do into the North American Union that's a bunch of foreign offshore globalists wanting to totally destroy us on record.
[00:45:08.071 --> 00:45:14.975]  And then they went on to say Obama isn't going to act like he said he would.
[00:45:15.987 --> 00:45:17.888]  Because that was all a feint.
[00:45:18.388 --> 00:45:22.130]  They already acted in January legalizing almost all the illegals.
[00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:26.272]  Five years to even, three years to five years to even have a deportation hearing.
[00:45:26.812 --> 00:45:27.613]  Totally fake.
[00:45:27.953 --> 00:45:33.316]  Just legalizing whoever can come here, loading them on government-paid-for buses, and shipping them to the Democratic Party.
[00:45:34.216 --> 00:45:35.176]  And that's the plan!
[00:45:35.196 --> 00:45:36.937]  And no one can even see it happening in plain view!
[00:45:36.957 --> 00:45:38.057]  A military asymmetrical program!
[00:46:05.848 --> 00:46:11.111]  Within five years, it will empty out the populations of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador.
[00:46:11.512 --> 00:46:12.272]  Mainstream news.
[00:46:12.532 --> 00:46:14.393]  That's the Congressional Budget Office.
[00:46:14.433 --> 00:46:18.336]  Looked at Obama's amnesty plan that he's done by fiat.
[00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:25.180]  Would empty out the entire populations of three Latin American countries.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.662]  El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala.
[00:46:30.284 --> 00:46:30.984]  The boldness.
[00:46:31.024 --> 00:46:32.285]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:46:37.697 --> 00:46:41.399]  And it's to bring the country down and turn us into something like Guatemala.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.320]  Politically.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:50.624]  And the elites are all in big government districts, armed fortresses, while we're all out here literally bankrupt on our knees.
[00:46:52.505 --> 00:46:58.348]  But don't worry, there'll be government handouts just enough to keep you under their control, like Chavez in Venezuela.
[00:47:00.689 --> 00:47:00.970]  Whew!
[00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:05.192]  I mean, you talk about diabolical precision.
[00:47:07.301 --> 00:47:12.325]  Now, I'm just giving you 30 seconds of one thing I sat there, and I watched almost an hour, 45 minutes of it.
[00:47:14.506 --> 00:47:17.668]  And I had to see the drug ads, and I see all the programming.
[00:47:23.332 --> 00:47:30.657]  Now, they think we're so disconnected from reality that they're saying imminent terror attack in El Paso at Fort Bliss.
[00:47:30.677 --> 00:47:32.038]  We're sending our reporters there right now.
[00:47:33.199 --> 00:47:34.740]  It could happen within days to weeks.
[00:47:36.101 --> 00:47:36.942]  Prepare for it.
[00:47:38.544 --> 00:47:41.747]  Going to happen, and the border is wide open.
[00:47:42.027 --> 00:47:43.569]  And they've basically sealed the base.
[00:47:45.451 --> 00:47:46.992]  Feds warn of imminent terror threat on U.S.
[00:47:47.012 --> 00:47:47.273]  border.
[00:47:47.593 --> 00:47:52.558]  Sources say ISIS operators will use vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices in attacks.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:02.267]  And again, if an attack comes, it'll be a real attack, or it could be provocateur, it could be...
[00:48:03.834 --> 00:48:28.190]  Totally staged, and they just claim some ISIS group, and have some NSA or FBI produced video come out, as we've caught them doing before with the CIA, putting the government logo, the Pentagon logo, in the same video layer as the Al Qaeda logo, with the grandson of the former head of the ADL, who's Jewish, supposedly commanding Al Qaeda.
[00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:30.692]  I mean, why does anyone even buy this?
[00:48:33.739 --> 00:48:35.379]  It's just, it's just so ridiculous.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.360]  And so, that's what we're facing.
[00:48:42.281 --> 00:48:50.722]  Is they may drive in some crazy jihadis, right across the border with a dump truck full of, you know, two tons of C4, and it blows up a third of the military base.
[00:48:51.222 --> 00:48:53.042]  Like the Beirut attack on the embassy.
[00:48:53.883 --> 00:48:55.023]  You got an area of the U.S.
[00:48:55.083 --> 00:48:57.043]  Embassy overrun and taken over in Tripoli.
[00:48:57.823 --> 00:48:58.463]  You got U.S.
[00:48:58.503 --> 00:48:59.784]  drone strikes in Somalia.
[00:49:00.624 --> 00:49:01.904]  Targets al-Shabaab leader.
[00:49:03.248 --> 00:49:08.515]  Scores killed as Boko Haram insurgents overrun Nigerian town.
[00:49:08.535 --> 00:49:09.456]  5,000 flee for their lives.
[00:49:10.978 --> 00:49:12.099]  War propaganda works.
[00:49:12.159 --> 00:49:17.006]  Large majority of Americans now want military action in Syria and Iraq to quote take out
[00:49:18.832 --> 00:49:25.754]  ISIS, but all they're going to do is end up guaranteed bombing, quote, other people, too.
[00:49:26.574 --> 00:49:29.815]  Oh, we think the Iraqi government fired a missile.
[00:49:29.855 --> 00:49:31.175]  We think Assad did it.
[00:49:31.675 --> 00:49:39.357]  And the public's so dumb, they'll go, yeah, that Assad, when al-Qaeda has been there for four years attacking him.
[00:49:39.377 --> 00:49:41.638]  Here's that story by Steve Watson, War Propaganda Works.
[00:49:42.098 --> 00:49:44.878]  Large majority of Americans now want military action in Syria, Iraq.
[00:49:45.198 --> 00:49:47.319]  Complete turnaround on attitudes from one year ago.
[00:49:49.608 --> 00:49:54.131]  And it's a 180 turn in the polls from 70 plus percent being against it to the other way around.
[00:49:55.052 --> 00:49:56.273]  Some polls 60 percent to 20.
[00:49:58.274 --> 00:49:59.035]  So there you go.
[00:49:59.575 --> 00:50:00.776]  Meanwhile, get this.
[00:50:01.937 --> 00:50:08.361]  In the UK, if you say you don't like open borders, they will come and arrest you saying it's a thought crime.
[00:50:08.421 --> 00:50:08.902]  I'm not kidding.
[00:50:08.942 --> 00:50:09.322]  Look it up.
[00:50:10.663 --> 00:50:13.425]  If you say the word homosexual, they say that's hurtful.
[00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:16.825]  And they will have you arrested like Robin Page, the BBC presenter.
[00:50:17.326 --> 00:50:21.748]  But, the jihadis are allowed to be on TV calling for blowing the government up.
[00:50:23.609 --> 00:50:27.431]  UK government proposes forced de-radicalization of returning jihadis.
[00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:34.194]  Proposals agreed by Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats to give them a training course when they come back.
[00:50:34.254 --> 00:50:34.975]  I'm not joking.
[00:50:35.435 --> 00:50:43.159]  They come back from chopping Christians' heads off, blowing up churches, blowing up non-radical Muslim mosques, and we're going to give you a government course.
[00:50:45.401 --> 00:50:46.802]  That's because they work for them.
[00:50:47.382 --> 00:50:51.144]  The head of the 7-7 bombings that came out was MI6.
[00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:55.466]  The US FBI even admitted that on Fox News.
[00:50:56.107 --> 00:50:56.407]  Okay?
[00:50:56.947 --> 00:50:58.708]  It's run by the globalists.
[00:50:58.848 --> 00:50:59.889]  I'm trying to explain that again.
[00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:06.953]  And when they build up a police state to fight Al-Qaeda here in America, ISIS, it will be used on the American people.
[00:51:06.973 --> 00:51:07.613]  Period.
[00:51:09.665 --> 00:51:14.627]  My Magic Mud is a tooth whitening powder that removes plaque and detoxifies your mouth.

[00:51:39.076 --> 00:51:39.856]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:51:39.876 --> 00:51:41.357]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:51:41.677 --> 00:51:42.958]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:51:43.318 --> 00:51:45.660]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.001]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:51:48.441 --> 00:51:52.484]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:51:52.944 --> 00:51:56.666]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:51:56.886 --> 00:52:00.348]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:52:00.668 --> 00:52:01.088]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:52:01.108 --> 00:52:02.729]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:52:08.186 --> 00:52:15.292]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:52:15.392 --> 00:52:17.574]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:52:17.754 --> 00:52:22.919]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:52:23.059 --> 00:52:28.123]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:52:28.243 --> 00:52:31.345]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:52:31.625 --> 00:52:35.508]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:52:35.728 --> 00:52:40.011]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:52:40.091 --> 00:52:50.158]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:52:50.378 --> 00:52:52.920]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.941]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[00:53:13.146 --> 00:53:14.907]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[00:53:15.147 --> 00:53:18.608]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas powered vehicle or generator.
[00:53:18.928 --> 00:53:22.729]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out of gas emergencies.
[00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:29.452]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies and it can be stored for many years.

[00:53:37.604 --> 00:53:38.544]  Our big story.
[00:53:38.804 --> 00:53:43.686]  Gun owners react as politicians continue to ban high-capacity magazines state by state.
[00:53:43.826 --> 00:53:46.747]  I think that these weapons ought to be stopped.
[00:53:46.947 --> 00:53:49.488]  Magazine restrictions have already happened in nine states.
[00:53:49.728 --> 00:53:56.450]  Staffed with formal special operations personnel, GunMagWarehouse.com is the only company that specializes in gun magazines.
[00:53:56.650 --> 00:54:00.931]  GunMagWarehouse.com has the largest selection of the magazines you should stock up on.
[00:54:01.091 --> 00:54:04.512]  Go now to GunMagWarehouse.com before it happens in your state.
[00:54:04.832 --> 00:54:06.193]  Get it before you regret it.
[00:54:24.332 --> 00:54:29.513]  So, is the American people put up with a federal government openly run by foreign banks?
[00:54:29.914 --> 00:54:30.974]  Alex Jones, you're back live.
[00:54:30.994 --> 00:54:32.014]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:54:33.194 --> 00:54:42.737]  Who publicly gives weapons and support to Al-Qaeda, to attack Assad, to attack Egypt, to attack Libya.
[00:54:44.639 --> 00:54:48.142]  And the jihadis are so out of control, they go and attack the U.S.
[00:54:48.182 --> 00:54:49.884]  substation and kill the ambassador.
[00:54:50.604 --> 00:55:00.794]  Our military is ordered to stand down so that al-Qaeda can get the three warehouses of weapons, including, at that one warehouse, folks, they believe, over 10,000 MPADS.
[00:55:01.314 --> 00:55:03.976]  Another 5,000 they got other places.
[00:55:03.996 --> 00:55:05.158]  15,000 surface-to-air missiles.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.582]  Can you imagine what al-Qaeda can do with 15,000 MPADS?
[00:55:13.835 --> 00:55:17.078]  One person with an MPAD could create an airliner disaster.
[00:55:21.483 --> 00:55:23.184]  You blow them up on takeoff or landing.
[00:55:25.286 --> 00:55:27.869]  And these guys have 15,000 of them.
[00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:31.292]  And our southern border is wide open.
[00:55:31.572 --> 00:55:32.774]  We broke, folks.
[00:55:34.208 --> 00:55:49.699]  And I'm ashamed to even say that for our country, that InfoWars had to do it, that they pull up in buses from Mexico, the Border Patrol is ordered to load them on buses, Democratic Party operatives come and give them their vouchers to go anywhere in the country they want to the safe houses.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:59.606]  It's such a joke that when I fly, they want me to take my shoes off, go through a naked body scanner, but on record, it was released two weeks ago,
[00:56:01.547 --> 00:56:04.408]  The illegals have to show no ID.
[00:56:06.348 --> 00:56:11.330]  They get profiled that they're from Mexico or Latin America, and they go right through.
[00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:12.690]  I mean, that is such bull.
[00:56:14.031 --> 00:56:15.191]  But of course, we're chumps.
[00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.212]  We put up with it, so we will live under it.
[00:56:17.452 --> 00:56:18.732]  We're jokes, people.
[00:56:19.032 --> 00:56:21.733]  We put up with police checkpoints, police blood draws.
[00:56:22.033 --> 00:56:24.834]  Oh, the drunk drivers, we have to get rid of your Fourth Amendment.
[00:56:25.134 --> 00:56:25.434]  Bull!
[00:56:27.659 --> 00:56:31.640]  And I don't blame the police even though they're following unconstitutional orders because that's pointless.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.200]  Blame the legislatures.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:35.521]  Blame the city councils.
[00:56:35.581 --> 00:56:36.441]  Blame the feds.
[00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:42.862]  Blame the standardization of policing so we have the same policing in the US they have in England or Australia.
[00:56:43.162 --> 00:56:44.763]  It's global standardized.
[00:56:45.083 --> 00:56:51.244]  The same global cloud, the same global surveillance, the same global NSA, the same global Gardasil.
[00:56:52.104 --> 00:56:56.705]  They gave Gardasil in Japan and India and it killed so many people both countries banned it.
[00:56:58.114 --> 00:56:58.574]  Not here.
[00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:01.998]  They double down and go, now all the boys need to take it at age 11.
[00:57:05.541 --> 00:57:10.006]  There's no deaths from boys from papillomavirus.
[00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:10.906]  4,000 women die a year from it.
[00:57:11.026 --> 00:57:12.648]  That's one of the rarest cancers out of 315 mil.
[00:57:15.179 --> 00:57:15.840]  4,000 people, 4,000 a year.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:20.383]  And usually they have an autoimmune disease like AIDS and that's how it kills you.
[00:57:20.624 --> 00:57:23.886]  You've got to basically have AIDS for papillomavirus.
[00:57:24.887 --> 00:57:32.514]  You know papillomavirus strains are in dirt and so you fall on your elbows when you're a kid in the dirt and you get warts on your elbows.
[00:57:32.754 --> 00:57:35.276]  That's a papillomavirus, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:37.018 --> 00:57:39.580]  So you're going to go take a shot that's known to kill people.
[00:57:40.663 --> 00:57:43.224]  Because, oh my gosh, there's a sexually transmitted form of it.
[00:57:43.524 --> 00:57:44.564]  Oh my gosh, how scary!
[00:57:44.624 --> 00:57:45.184]  Oh my gosh!
[00:57:45.304 --> 00:57:45.805]  Oh my gosh!
[00:57:46.125 --> 00:57:47.645]  I mean, this is how stupid it is!
[00:57:47.925 --> 00:57:58.549]  Our borders are open, Al-Qaeda is set to attack, our reporters are going down there to cover it, and when Al-Qaeda blows up Fort Bliss or something, or blows up a school, I'm gonna lose my freedom!
[00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:01.209]  My children are!
[00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:03.170]  You are!
[00:58:06.274 --> 00:58:09.515]  And the whole endgame is about taking your pension funds and running your life.
[00:58:10.175 --> 00:58:15.637]  So all of you that go along with this, go play your fantasy football, or just say I'm wrong, or, oh, that guy's a radical.
[00:58:15.817 --> 00:58:16.537]  I'm not a radical.
[00:58:16.677 --> 00:58:18.638]  This is all in black and white right now.
[00:58:20.138 --> 00:58:21.779]  They are escalating the war with Russia.
[00:58:22.039 --> 00:58:24.439]  Of course the Russians have troops in eastern Ukraine.
[00:58:24.459 --> 00:58:26.180]  They're battling for their oil infrastructure.
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:33.122]  And you've got NATO, and they're trying to start World War III, and now Putin says he can take Kiev in two weeks.
[00:58:34.673 --> 00:58:35.934]  Vladimir Putin warns European leaders.
[00:58:36.194 --> 00:58:37.476]  I haven't even gotten into the news yet.
[00:58:37.496 --> 00:58:38.797]  We're going to take your phone calls, too.
[00:58:40.158 --> 00:58:41.519]  Talk about political correctness, though.
[00:58:41.579 --> 00:58:44.061]  We can't have any border now because it's racist.
[00:58:44.442 --> 00:58:54.170]  It turned out in England that giant Muslim pedophile rings trafficking small children with literal rape raps, but nothing could be done because it's politically incorrect.
[00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:56.693]  See, it's a religion of mind control.
[00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:00.993]  In the near future.
[00:59:01.293 --> 00:59:05.434]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:59:05.794 --> 00:59:06.795]  Security alert.
[00:59:07.015 --> 00:59:08.755]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:59:09.015 --> 00:59:09.635]  Analysis.
[00:59:09.895 --> 00:59:10.536]  InfoWars.
[00:59:10.616 --> 00:59:12.696]  Building independent media operations.
[00:59:12.716 --> 00:59:17.557]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:59:17.597 --> 00:59:18.598]  Prime Directive.
[00:59:18.638 --> 00:59:20.098]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:59:20.178 --> 00:59:22.959]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:23.019 --> 00:59:26.099]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:59:26.279 --> 00:59:28.460]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.061]  People are assaulting us.
[00:59:30.081 --> 00:59:32.202]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:59:32.242 --> 00:59:34.603]  They are never going to stop.
[00:59:34.864 --> 00:59:38.806]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:46.590]  Imperative.
[00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:48.852]  Destroy FringePlanet TV.
[00:59:48.892 --> 00:59:53.234]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:59:53.594 --> 00:59:54.935]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:59:54.955 --> 00:59:55.696]  You can feel it.
[01:00:01.812 --> 01:00:03.717]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.198 --> 01:00:06.965]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.881 --> 01:00:15.521]  Big Brother.
[01:00:16.181 --> 01:00:17.222]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.942 --> 01:00:19.062]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:20.503]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.283 --> 01:00:22.183]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.844 --> 01:00:26.445]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.025 --> 01:00:31.086]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.976 --> 01:00:48.582]  Coming up, Darren McBreen produced a special report that's extremely powerful, dealing with mind control and controlled state-run media.
[01:00:48.622 --> 01:00:50.903]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:51.824 --> 01:00:54.346]  I know a lot of stations join us in the second and third hour.
[01:00:54.406 --> 01:00:55.487]  We're into the second hour now.
[01:00:55.507 --> 01:01:00.510]  I want to give the phone number out at the start of the next segment and take phone calls as well.
[01:01:03.512 --> 01:01:07.956]  The establishment basically says, hey, just take whatever we do, accept it, everything will be okay.
[01:01:09.269 --> 01:01:15.911]  No, everything won't be okay because the status quo is about deconstructing basic liberty so that we can all be controlled.
[01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:20.112]  Revealed!
[01:01:20.192 --> 01:01:25.334]  Hacked nude celebrity photos had been on deep web, black market, for a week.
[01:01:26.014 --> 01:01:28.915]  And there could be even more to come as they shopped them for sale.
[01:01:34.597 --> 01:01:37.498]  Jihadis launch attacks from Pakistan,
[01:01:41.428 --> 01:01:42.269]  To North Africa.
[01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:46.132]  I want to do a special report for the nightly news tonight.
[01:01:47.613 --> 01:01:49.935]  Where I get up there with the big maps and explain it to everybody.
[01:01:51.597 --> 01:02:00.225]  And soon I'm going to move in the big studio over there so I can, during the radio slash TV show, get up with a headset and go around and and with a clicker like a weatherman.
[01:02:01.906 --> 01:02:06.310]  Go through all these exhibits for people because it's important to see it.
[01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:08.472]  But Pakistan
[01:02:11.044 --> 01:02:13.865]  Has been putting up with so much New World Order garbage.
[01:02:17.186 --> 01:02:31.612]  Our government, since 9-11, bipartisan, has been in there trying to overthrow their secular government and overthrow their military.
[01:02:33.643 --> 01:02:38.006]  That's been one of the only countries long-running that stopped the New World Order taking them over.
[01:02:38.446 --> 01:02:39.987]  And I'm not romanticizing Pakistan.
[01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:41.448]  It's got corruption and its own problems.
[01:02:42.409 --> 01:02:50.894]  But they brought the 40,000 jihadis in to US bases in Pakistan after 9-11.
[01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:58.370]  The real Al Qaeda and Taliban was picked up, brought in, to start destabilization over there.
[01:02:58.390 --> 01:03:01.652]  And then the globalists hit one button and they're jihadis.
[01:03:02.173 --> 01:03:09.338]  All over the world start blowing stuff up, attacking, trying to take over Pakistani military bases and media complexes.
[01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:21.568]  Again, then the West will come in and bomb those very people posing as the savior, which further stirs people up against the Pakistani government, saying, do something about this, stop working with America.
[01:03:22.418 --> 01:03:24.458]  But Pakistan's playing the same double game.
[01:03:24.859 --> 01:03:27.479]  So you can argue the only way to survive this is being Machiavelli.
[01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:33.801]  But at a certain point, it gets so Machiavellian that there is no policy anymore.
[01:03:36.561 --> 01:03:38.562]  And I'm not defending the Pakistani leader either.
[01:03:38.602 --> 01:03:39.962]  It's a very complex situation.
[01:03:40.602 --> 01:03:47.384]  It's just that you see the Arab Spring being stirred up by Google, by MI6, by the State Department.
[01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:49.804]  And we told you that four years ago when it all started.
[01:03:51.025 --> 01:03:51.645]  It's now admitted.
[01:03:52.659 --> 01:04:07.383]  That they saw the revolutions coming, so using social media and allowing the groups they wanted to operate and to recruit, they basically steered the dam that had already broken for revolution.
[01:04:07.863 --> 01:04:09.964]  They steered the water where they wanted it to go.
[01:04:11.584 --> 01:04:12.684]  That's the best way to describe it.
[01:04:13.205 --> 01:04:14.805]  They ride the bucking bronco.
[01:04:16.225 --> 01:04:16.866]  And they study it.
[01:04:18.906 --> 01:04:21.967]  Everything we face is scientific social control.
[01:04:24.375 --> 01:04:27.556]  So in fact, what I'm going to do is I'm going to air the Darren McBrain piece when we come back.
[01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:31.978]  And then we will go to your phone calls.
[01:04:32.018 --> 01:04:33.158]  I think that's the best way to do it.
[01:04:34.699 --> 01:04:41.001]  I want to hear from first-time callers about what do you think the most important issue is out there right now?
[01:04:41.621 --> 01:04:47.103]  Or is it the fact that they're trying to stimulate mega crises across the board?
[01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:55.614]  And that it's that attempt to create the global crisis to bring in the world government, as Henry Kissinger just wrote in the Wall Street Journal last week.
[01:04:56.494 --> 01:04:58.255]  How do you stop something like that?
[01:04:58.655 --> 01:05:00.776]  How do you get the public to see outside the box?
[01:05:01.737 --> 01:05:02.517]  It's a mind trick.
[01:05:02.697 --> 01:05:06.079]  Once you get outside of it, you're like, how did that ever fool me to begin with?
[01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.080]  It's like the Matrix.
[01:05:08.982 --> 01:05:19.166]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:05:19.526 --> 01:05:25.908]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:28.229]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:31.390]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:38.293]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:05:38.826 --> 01:05:42.327]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:42.487 --> 01:05:46.448]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:46.768 --> 01:05:48.208]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:48.548 --> 01:05:56.110]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:57.250]  But for how long?
[01:05:57.530 --> 01:06:03.811]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:04.171 --> 01:06:06.992]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:08.479 --> 01:06:10.860]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:17.484]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[01:06:17.664 --> 01:06:20.285]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[01:06:20.445 --> 01:06:22.206]  If not, then I want to know why.
[01:06:22.406 --> 01:06:24.628]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[01:06:24.708 --> 01:06:28.910]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports or soap operas.
[01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:30.191]  I say, so what?
[01:06:30.331 --> 01:06:32.333]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:35.655]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[01:06:35.915 --> 01:06:40.038]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[01:06:40.179 --> 01:06:45.863]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm still fighting.
[01:06:46.023 --> 01:06:49.045]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[01:06:49.265 --> 01:06:50.947]  The Info War is worldwide.
[01:06:51.087 --> 01:06:55.210]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:58.993]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented facts.
[01:06:59.113 --> 01:07:06.182]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[01:07:06.342 --> 01:07:07.944]  The truth will set them free.
[01:07:08.204 --> 01:07:15.193]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:07:15.373 --> 01:07:17.534]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:07:17.714 --> 01:07:22.818]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:28.021]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:07:28.161 --> 01:07:31.203]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:07:31.483 --> 01:07:35.345]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:07:35.565 --> 01:07:39.807]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:07:39.867 --> 01:07:49.892]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:07:50.112 --> 01:07:52.613]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:07:52.813 --> 01:08:00.863]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:08:01.024 --> 01:08:04.989]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:08:10.313 --> 01:08:29.305]  Aldous Huxley, the author of A Brave New World, he said in an interview back in 1958 that the social engineers of the future, they will figure out a way to enslave us by tricking us and conditioning all of us into thinking that we are actually free.
[01:08:29.646 --> 01:08:35.910]  This was also well thought out and researched by the father of propaganda, Edward Bernays.
[01:08:36.977 --> 01:08:53.657]  Who in his 1928 book, Propaganda, Bernays wrote, if we understand the mechanisms and motives of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will, without them knowing it.
[01:08:54.076 --> 01:09:06.927]  He called it the engineering of consent and proposed that those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government, which is the true ruling power of our country.
[01:09:07.227 --> 01:09:14.614]  So are we living in an Orwellian nightmare that was prophesied by the likes of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Edward Bernays?
[01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:25.885]  Well, I did some research and I put together some video clips that shows how the globalist mind control has been present in our everyday lives, our entire lives.
[01:09:26.426 --> 01:09:28.107]  Because the future is now.
[01:09:28.128 --> 01:09:31.631]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:34.014]  We're live on the second day.
[01:09:36.486 --> 01:09:43.872]  If you want to preserve your power indefinitely, you have to get the consent of the ruled.
[01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:55.522]  And this they will do, partly by drugs, as I foresaw in Brave New World, partly by these new techniques of propaganda.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:56.621]  I think?
[01:10:16.022 --> 01:10:19.404]  In some ways, happy under the new regime.
[01:10:19.905 --> 01:10:22.886]  But they would be happy in a situation where they oughtn't to be happy.
[01:10:23.067 --> 01:10:25.368]  This is the big picture.
[01:10:25.948 --> 01:10:29.851]  An official television report to the nation from the United States Army.
[01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:37.921]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[01:10:38.322 --> 01:10:45.029]  Here, recruits with specialized backgrounds were taught the nature, methods, and techniques of propaganda and its dissemination.
[01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:48.292]  Radio presents these facts in any number of ways.
[01:10:48.933 --> 01:10:52.237]  Perhaps its most rewarding form of expression is news.
[01:10:54.346 --> 01:10:56.487]  For news is ready-made propaganda.
[01:10:57.147 --> 01:11:02.628]  And to an enemy, denied access to outside information, it's as welcome as food and water.
[01:11:03.489 --> 01:11:08.430]  Radio's principal advantage is that it can reach remote areas, and reach them quickly.
[01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:16.052]  So that one program can be repeated, and thereby reach a larger audience, it is often recorded on discs, or on tape.
[01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:20.874]  The same show can be rebroadcast at convenient times in different areas.
[01:11:24.835 --> 01:11:35.619]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[01:11:36.119 --> 01:11:38.861]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:42.562]  You should reject these voices.
[01:11:42.922 --> 01:11:47.644]  Public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific
[01:11:48.775 --> 01:11:50.376]  Technological elite.
[01:11:50.756 --> 01:11:58.879]  My team, my specialties, information operations and the psychological arm of things, we are trained to deceive if we have to.
[01:11:58.899 --> 01:12:12.923]  If you found out that your public affairs team that was showing you around actually had just completed a 40-hour course in psychological operations and was trained in psyops and in military deception, you start to question, hey, is that an appropriate use of that resource?
[01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:13.884]  You shouldn't trust me.
[01:12:13.924 --> 01:12:17.545]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the news.
[01:12:17.805 --> 01:12:19.626]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:26.249]  Took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:12:26.269 --> 01:12:33.773]  They had kids in incubators and they were thrown out of the incubators so that Kuwait could be systematically dismantled.
[01:12:34.013 --> 01:12:39.896]  Go read a book by the father of modern advertising, Edward Bernays, where he calls you a dumb slave and admits they run your whole life.
[01:12:41.534 --> 01:12:42.795]  I've read both his major books.
[01:12:42.815 --> 01:12:44.197]  One of them is called Propaganda.
[01:12:44.757 --> 01:12:46.018]  Edward Bernays.
[01:12:46.739 --> 01:12:49.582]  Psychological warfare operations went into high gear.
[01:12:49.962 --> 01:12:51.984]  Our propaganda was beginning to pay off.
[01:12:56.308 --> 01:13:00.792]  There's a global crime syndicate that controls NATO and the major western governments.
[01:13:00.892 --> 01:13:04.876]  And it is using Al-Qaeda to overthrow secular governments.
[01:13:07.332 --> 01:13:11.693]  I also can't see sending my son to fight with Islamic rebels against Christians.
[01:13:12.093 --> 01:13:17.035]  I also can't see my son going to fight on the same side as Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:17.255 --> 01:13:21.416]  The people we are fighting today, we funded 20 years ago.
[01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:24.957]  It was almost as if it were a planned enclosure.
[01:13:25.558 --> 01:13:27.098]  It just pancaked.
[01:13:27.358 --> 01:13:29.879]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision enclosure.
[01:13:48.325 --> 01:13:55.087]  Millions of people are sick and tired of the endless wars, the poverty that is coming, the attacks of our civil liberties.
[01:13:55.487 --> 01:13:56.948]  I don't believe in conspiracy theories.
[01:13:56.968 --> 01:13:58.168]  Conspiracies, yes.
[01:13:58.688 --> 01:14:00.449]  If I believe it, there's nothing theory about it.
[01:14:00.609 --> 01:14:03.270]  You take the blue pill, the story ends.
[01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:06.811]  You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
[01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:10.212]  You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.163]  And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[01:14:14.463 --> 01:14:19.708]  Meantime, there are questions multiplying today about the mysterious death of award-winning journalist Michael Hastings.
[01:14:20.009 --> 01:14:30.240]  We are also requesting that your team of advisors include a senior officer who is thoroughly experienced in psychological operations.
[01:14:36.224 --> 01:14:39.486]  Psychological warfare was established as a special staff agency.
[01:14:40.187 --> 01:14:42.128]  This move had far-reaching results.
[01:14:42.468 --> 01:14:43.429]  You consider yourself smart?
[01:14:43.449 --> 01:14:47.232]  Oh, I would very definitely say that I, uh... I, uh... I mean, Mark, that is correct.
[01:14:47.472 --> 01:14:52.835]  This American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.
[01:14:53.096 --> 01:14:55.557]  What if the whole purpose of government was to negate freedom?
[01:14:56.518 --> 01:14:57.619]  What if freedom was a myth?
[01:14:58.539 --> 01:15:00.601]  What if the Constitution meant nothing to the government?
[01:15:01.521 --> 01:15:04.704]  What if everything the government has, or owns, or controls has been stolen?
[01:15:05.717 --> 01:15:07.978]  It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[01:15:08.198 --> 01:15:13.860]  We're building a domestic army and we're shrinking the military because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:15:14.141 --> 01:15:17.522]  This is what we have to look forward to all over the place.
[01:15:17.762 --> 01:15:23.104]  Look how quick, within a matter of days, they were able to go into a martial law status here in Ferguson.
[01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:26.086]  They have this entire bridge, this road, blocked off.
[01:15:26.126 --> 01:15:28.387]  You are the parking lot!
[01:15:28.427 --> 01:15:28.927]  This is the St.
[01:15:28.967 --> 01:15:30.948]  Louis County Police Department!
[01:15:31.348 --> 01:15:32.708]  Disperse now!
[01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:34.049]  They're coming to play!
[01:15:36.973 --> 01:15:39.674]  Joe Biggs got shot with a rubber bullet.
[01:15:39.714 --> 01:15:42.156]  Man, quit shooting at me!
[01:15:43.117 --> 01:15:50.402]  Quit shooting at me!
[01:15:51.803 --> 01:15:54.044]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up!
[01:15:54.344 --> 01:15:55.225]  This isn't a game!
[01:15:57.707 --> 01:15:58.807]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:25.994]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:16:26.074 --> 01:16:34.319]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:16:34.499 --> 01:16:39.201]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:16:39.381 --> 01:16:43.023]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:45.045]  We're good to go.
[01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:15.372]  Now again, that was about a seven-minute segment from Friday night's InfoWars Nightly News, complete with a 30-second ad for coffee at the end of it.
[01:17:15.392 --> 01:17:15.752]  That's what...
[01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:36.276]  We do is basically fund our own operation with high quality products that are organic and that we personally use and believe in.
[01:17:37.096 --> 01:17:41.979]  But dealing with the issue of mind control manipulation, it's going on, it's happening.
[01:17:44.079 --> 01:17:52.043]  And the people working in the government are just as manipulated or more so than people that aren't in it.
[01:17:54.031 --> 01:18:13.758]  And under this global governance system, it is select top corporations and banks that write the global laws, set the policies, give themselves diplomatic immunity, and remove themselves from being able to take responsibility for anything.
[01:18:14.078 --> 01:18:15.559]  They're basically the unseen hand.
[01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:21.100]  They think the public's so stupid, though, that books are written, reports are issued.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.420]  It's all very public.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:30.282]  And that's my big frustration, is you could debate me about my interpretation of some of this stuff, and I am occasionally wrong about this or that.
[01:18:32.123 --> 01:18:44.706]  But if you're tuning in to the Alex Jones Show and listening to me, Alex Jones, for the first time, I want to beg you to not believe a word I say and to go research the claims we're making.
[01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:54.117]  Because when you find out that I'm telling you the truth, 95% of the time, we do make mistakes some of the time.
[01:18:55.258 --> 01:19:01.685]  And when you find out that most of the time it's worse than I'm saying, you'll realize we've got to do something.
[01:19:04.748 --> 01:19:05.769]  I want to give the number out.
[01:19:07.056 --> 01:19:09.538]  For first-time callers, where do you see our world going?
[01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:11.961]  Is there a way to shake people out of their mind control?
[01:19:12.742 --> 01:19:18.828]  What do you think about the world becoming so unstable, as the Secretary of Defense has said, and Obama is countering that, saying, there's no problem.
[01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:21.010]  It's the media making people think there's a problem.
[01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:26.335]  Now a second American journalist has been beheaded.
[01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:27.436]  That's the London Telegraph.
[01:19:27.817 --> 01:19:30.820]  That story's going up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:19:33.319 --> 01:19:36.141]  We'll tell you about that when we come back and tie it into the imminent attack.
[01:19:36.621 --> 01:19:41.105]  They're saying it's coming sometime between now and September 11th.
[01:19:41.525 --> 01:19:43.106]  When do they attack the U.S.
[01:19:44.027 --> 01:19:45.408]  safe house in Benghazi?
[01:19:45.628 --> 01:19:46.409]  September 11th.
[01:19:47.169 --> 01:19:50.432]  When are they launching these attacks all over the Middle East and Africa?
[01:19:51.592 --> 01:19:52.313]  September 11th.
[01:19:52.773 --> 01:19:59.658]  There is an al-Qaeda, ISIS, IS, global offensive being launched right now.
[01:20:00.539 --> 01:20:01.400]  And it's real.
[01:20:02.852 --> 01:20:07.085]  This is a real terror threat, but it was turned loose by the New World Order.
[01:20:08.507 --> 01:20:11.089]  Do you ever feel like you live in an alternate universe?
[01:20:11.569 --> 01:20:15.111]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying.
[01:20:15.711 --> 01:20:18.473]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[01:20:18.733 --> 01:20:19.934]  Chaos on our border.
[01:20:20.354 --> 01:20:22.415]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[01:20:22.876 --> 01:20:24.437]  Life is getting ready to change.
[01:20:24.797 --> 01:20:27.438]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.
[01:20:27.859 --> 01:20:31.021]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.

[01:20:38.465 --> 01:20:41.025]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:10.272]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?

[01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:15.354]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:15.614 --> 01:22:23.476]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:23.736 --> 01:22:28.038]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:28.258 --> 01:22:32.059]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:32.219 --> 01:22:37.923]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:38.164 --> 01:22:40.946]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:41.326 --> 01:22:46.550]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:23:11.465 --> 01:23:15.247]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[01:23:16.548 --> 01:23:18.248]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[01:23:18.609 --> 01:23:19.889]  Police call it robbery.
[01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:22.210]  We call it avoidable.
[01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:28.334]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:33.676]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[01:23:34.156 --> 01:23:40.179]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.

[01:24:40.457 --> 01:24:41.238]  until 2 p.m.
[01:24:41.298 --> 01:24:43.239]  Central Standard Time, we're here live.
[01:24:43.799 --> 01:24:46.740]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.801]  What an incredible time to be alive with all this news.
[01:24:50.521 --> 01:24:51.502]  And how crazy it is.
[01:24:54.639 --> 01:24:56.961]  Look at these headlines up on Infowars.com.
[01:24:57.041 --> 01:24:57.921]  This just broke.
[01:24:58.602 --> 01:25:05.127]  Mysterious fake cell phone towers found across America.
[01:25:05.207 --> 01:25:08.169]  Imposter towers discovered near U.S.
[01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:08.910]  Army base.
[01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:10.491]  I'm betting money.
[01:25:14.448 --> 01:25:17.709]  That these are going to be tied in to the towers they put up.
[01:25:18.129 --> 01:25:21.850]  Homeland Security in Chicago and a bunch of other major cities.
[01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:32.194]  Seattle, that we discovered first, our sources inside the government, city government in this case, sent us the documents that became national news earlier this year.
[01:25:32.814 --> 01:25:42.217]  Mikel Thelen's article, when it was actually government snoop towers grabbing all the data, they found it's cheaper to not lease it from the shell companies, they just put up their own.
[01:25:44.451 --> 01:25:46.553]  But we'll cover that coming up in the next segment.
[01:25:49.175 --> 01:25:50.996]  Another key article by Kurt Nemo.
[01:25:51.156 --> 01:26:05.587]  Feds ignore ISIS border terror threat, focus instead on political groups in America saying returning veterans, gun owners, and the Tea Party are the number one threat to America.
[01:26:06.268 --> 01:26:12.493]  You've seen them on CNN, on MSNBC, in the New York Times, telling police it's imminent
[01:26:13.547 --> 01:26:18.508]  That returning veterans are going to IED police departments and attack.
[01:26:18.528 --> 01:26:19.589]  That's in all the manuals.
[01:26:19.869 --> 01:26:20.489]  That's on the news.
[01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:23.070]  And there's no true examples of that.
[01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:26.710]  Oklahoma City was as phony as a $3 bill.
[01:26:27.051 --> 01:26:28.851]  What we know is the official story was not true.
[01:26:28.871 --> 01:26:30.011]  There were bombs inside the building.
[01:26:30.972 --> 01:26:32.012]  But I'm not going there today.
[01:26:33.012 --> 01:26:38.013]  The point is, the number one threat, they say, is basically conservatives.
[01:26:38.574 --> 01:26:39.834]  Or anybody that isn't a communist.
[01:26:41.212 --> 01:26:46.235]  It's not the people that have put out a new video, IIS, Islamic State.
[01:26:46.656 --> 01:26:52.960]  Steven Sotloff, beheaded by Islamic State, breaking London Telegraph.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:27:01.586]  Islamic State of Iraq has reportedly released a video showing the beheading of US hostage, Steven Sotloff.
[01:27:03.097 --> 01:27:07.579]  American hostage Steven Sotloff has been reportedly executed by jihadist terrorists.
[01:27:07.939 --> 01:27:09.800]  There was no immediate confirmation of the video.
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:15.063]  He disappeared, 31 years old, while reporting in Syria in August of 2013.
[01:27:15.623 --> 01:27:22.026]  His apparent kidnapping was not widely reported until he appeared on a video released last month by IS.
[01:27:24.577 --> 01:27:26.859]  In the footage, a mass militant beheads U.S.
[01:27:26.899 --> 01:27:34.644]  reporter James Foley and parades Mr. Sotloff, warning that he will meet the same fate unless U.S.
[01:27:34.664 --> 01:27:37.886]  President Barack Obama ends airstrikes against the group in Iraq.
[01:27:38.346 --> 01:27:39.387]  More to follow.
[01:27:43.409 --> 01:27:44.230]  Oh, man!
[01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:46.431]  And why am I angry?
[01:27:46.691 --> 01:27:48.312]  Not just that he got his head chopped off.
[01:27:48.432 --> 01:27:49.253]  Rest in peace.
[01:27:51.154 --> 01:27:53.316]  It's that I live in Texas.
[01:27:54.656 --> 01:27:56.198]  The border is wide open.
[01:27:56.718 --> 01:28:00.202]  The Feds have opened the gates, physically, in El Paso.
[01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:02.845]  In fact, we have video of that.
[01:28:03.205 --> 01:28:04.347]  We just shot a few weeks ago.
[01:28:06.704 --> 01:28:09.565]  Biggs has got it, I forget the name of it, but it's in a report.
[01:28:09.885 --> 01:28:12.506]  They even got an airplane and flew over to show it.
[01:28:13.026 --> 01:28:17.708]  And the gates are just open in a major city, El Paso, and just people mill back and forth.
[01:28:18.508 --> 01:28:20.969]  And this is while they're saying terror attack is imminent.
[01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:27.931]  They think Fort Bliss and Joint Task Force Six and Biggs Field, no pun intended, is the target.
[01:28:32.691 --> 01:28:38.096]  And then if Al Qaeda does attack, no one will get in trouble for the border being wide open.
[01:28:40.518 --> 01:28:41.339]  I will get in trouble.
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:44.662]  I will be blamed with it or something by MSNBC.
[01:28:51.408 --> 01:28:55.151]  We're showing some footage of our investigations with the border basically wide open in Arizona as well.
[01:28:56.052 --> 01:28:58.554]  But El Paso is a major, major target.
[01:28:59.991 --> 01:29:07.595]  But don't worry, they have a social worker program for British returning jihadis who've been running around chopping people's heads off.
[01:29:09.457 --> 01:29:14.580]  US, UK government proposed forced de-radicalization.
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:19.583]  The headlines like it's, oh it's so mean of returning jihadists, oh my gosh!
[01:29:20.583 --> 01:29:24.986]  Fresh off chopping off heads and blowing up churches, Britain's governing coalition has agreed that
[01:29:25.902 --> 01:29:33.648]  Potential jihadists who return to Britain from abroad should be forced to undergo a de-radicalization program when they arrive back in the UK.
[01:29:33.948 --> 01:29:34.909]  How about they get arrested?
[01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:43.856]  The proposal is one of the series of measures agreed to by the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats who, from Britain's coalition government... Give me a break.
[01:29:46.658 --> 01:29:51.282]  And of course, really, they admit it's a passenger-less sharing program to take everybody's rights in England.
[01:29:53.874 --> 01:29:56.496]  When the government is behind funding these people to begin with.
[01:29:56.516 --> 01:30:01.118]  See they fund, create the group, then use the threat to take over.
[01:30:02.159 --> 01:30:04.921]  I'm gonna give the number out, when they come back we'll take your phone call, stay with us.
[01:30:06.201 --> 01:30:06.502]  Unbelievable.
[01:30:09.185 --> 01:30:15.128]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:15.328 --> 01:30:19.530]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:19.891 --> 01:30:24.453]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:24.873 --> 01:30:27.495]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:27.795 --> 01:30:32.978]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:33.239 --> 01:30:40.123]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:40.623 --> 01:30:44.406]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:44.766 --> 01:30:49.549]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:49.889 --> 01:30:50.730]  This is innovating.
[01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:58.295]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:47.535]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:31:47.655 --> 01:31:48.656]  Talk about the effects.
[01:31:48.996 --> 01:31:50.457]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:31:50.477 --> 01:31:52.118]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:31:52.418 --> 01:31:53.479]  I feel like I look better.
[01:31:53.539 --> 01:31:54.200]  I feel better.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.300]  I feel sexier.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.041]  I love it.

[01:32:06.668 --> 01:32:07.749]  This is life changing.
[01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:09.370]  Another major health threat.
[01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:14.314]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:32:14.394 --> 01:32:17.036]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:32:17.076 --> 01:32:23.841]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:32:24.121 --> 01:32:26.963]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:32:27.123 --> 01:32:30.025]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:32:30.045 --> 01:32:32.047]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:32:32.087 --> 01:32:34.929]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:32:35.009 --> 01:32:40.492]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:32:40.712 --> 01:32:44.214]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:32:44.234 --> 01:32:47.215]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:33:05.045 --> 01:33:20.098]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:20.458 --> 01:33:21.299]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.379 --> 01:33:26.083]  Joe Obama has come out and said that
[01:33:34.051 --> 01:33:39.694]  He's not going to do an executive order on legalizing the illegals right now, which isn't even true.
[01:33:39.754 --> 01:33:50.580]  He's already, outside of even an executive order, ordered the Border Patrol illegally to not stop these illegals and to let people get on buses and to pay to ship them into the country.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:34:00.846]  And then the big faith-based initiatives are getting government money to house and get housing for the illegals as a magnet to bring unlimited numbers here.
[01:34:03.012 --> 01:34:09.540]  Our reporters were down in El Paso just two weeks ago at the Army base there.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:14.105]  We had a lot of contacts there because Joe Biggs was stationed there for a time.
[01:34:16.528 --> 01:34:21.814]  And they got video of the gates at night to Mexico wide open.
[01:34:22.557 --> 01:34:25.399]  We have the video of that in El Paso.
[01:34:25.879 --> 01:34:28.421]  We're going to repost that to InfoWars.com.
[01:34:28.441 --> 01:34:29.241]  We need a headline.
[01:34:29.982 --> 01:34:33.404]  Border gates open in El Paso as Al Qaeda threat looms.
[01:34:36.886 --> 01:34:39.248]  Now again, who funded Al Qaeda?
[01:34:39.268 --> 01:34:40.629]  Who let them get a base in Iraq?
[01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:41.409]  A base in Syria?
[01:34:41.690 --> 01:34:42.610]  Who gave them the weapons?
[01:34:42.650 --> 01:34:43.351]  The West did.
[01:34:43.451 --> 01:34:46.433]  It came out in Senate hearings last year.
[01:34:47.273 --> 01:34:49.655]  The expansion of support stopped.
[01:34:51.735 --> 01:34:55.318]  But it's like having a pet rattlesnake that you hand feed mice to.
[01:34:56.259 --> 01:35:00.042]  You reach in there one day to feed it a baby mouse, it's going to bite you on the finger.
[01:35:03.084 --> 01:35:05.326]  And that's what's going on with IS and Al Qaeda.
[01:35:06.527 --> 01:35:16.235]  Again, almost every terror attack is either provocative where they find a mentally ill person and wind them up to do it and then let them attack to get more funding and take liberties.
[01:35:17.601 --> 01:35:25.883]  Or, it's a criminal group directly funded by criminal elements in the government who are real jihadis, but are protected and all the doors are open for them.
[01:35:26.564 --> 01:35:28.204]  That's one of the most common forms of attacks.
[01:35:28.484 --> 01:35:29.284]  That's what this is going to be.
[01:35:30.645 --> 01:35:41.708]  Or, it's completely, totally staged, and they have patsies they set up, like Mohammed Adda and others, who we know were trained by the CIA and Defense Intelligence at the
[01:35:44.343 --> 01:35:50.948]  Well, the Sacramento Bee reported on it there at the War College training facility.
[01:35:54.111 --> 01:35:55.152]  The Defense Language School.
[01:35:58.594 --> 01:36:02.337]  And people blew the whistle that five of the supposed hijackers were really U.S.
[01:36:02.357 --> 01:36:03.018]  government agents.
[01:36:03.478 --> 01:36:05.820]  We don't know exactly what happened on 9-11.
[01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:09.043]  We just know there's a cover-up of what did.
[01:36:10.526 --> 01:36:21.154]  And the official story doesn't add up, and 9-11 was used to take our basic freedoms and transform this country into an oligarchical tyranny.
[01:36:22.475 --> 01:36:29.500]  A totalitarian Orwellian system that we're transforming to, that we're slouching into, that we're sliding into.
[01:36:29.761 --> 01:36:32.182]  Well, what does CNN and Fox News and MSNBC do?
[01:36:32.222 --> 01:36:39.188]  They come out and say, Alex Jones says that George Bush, with a detonator like Wile E. Coyote, blew up the towers.
[01:36:40.672 --> 01:36:43.393]  Alex Jones says the firefighters blew up the towers.
[01:36:44.613 --> 01:36:46.293]  Because it's the government and they're the government.
[01:36:46.773 --> 01:36:50.774]  I never said anything like that.
[01:36:51.515 --> 01:36:54.235]  I said there's clearly explosives in those towers.
[01:36:55.395 --> 01:36:56.576]  These people are being tracked.
[01:36:56.656 --> 01:36:57.736]  They were being protected.
[01:36:57.856 --> 01:37:01.357]  Why are we attacking Iraq when it's supposedly Saudi Arabia behind it?
[01:37:02.597 --> 01:37:04.218]  Look at the NORAD stand down.
[01:37:05.139 --> 01:37:09.321]  Look at the CIA drills of the towers being attacked that exact same day at that exact same time.
[01:37:09.982 --> 01:37:12.703]  Look at the 9-1-1 tapes, the air traffic tapes.
[01:37:13.044 --> 01:37:18.007]  Look at the police on video, live on CNN going, get back, they're going to bring down Building 7.
[01:37:20.108 --> 01:37:20.888]  You see that building?
[01:37:20.928 --> 01:37:21.589]  It's coming down.
[01:37:23.868 --> 01:37:27.330]  Then CNN would say, does Alex Jones think the police blew it up?
[01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:28.010]  No!
[01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:32.032]  There's video of cops going, get back, they're getting ready to bring it down.
[01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:34.994]  I was buying a pizza that day.
[01:37:35.514 --> 01:37:42.097]  I've been on the air since it started as a guest on Genesis, did my own show, and then had a nighttime show I did then.
[01:37:42.458 --> 01:37:45.359]  I was on all day long, took a break at 4 o'clock.
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:48.861]  They blew it up at 525 Eastern, 425 Central.
[01:37:52.338 --> 01:38:03.060]  Drove to the pizza place to pick up the pizza and heard CBS News Radio, which isn't even on anymore, report Solomon Brothers 47-story building.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.681]  They're going to bring it down to controlled demolition so it doesn't damage surrounding buildings.
[01:38:08.121 --> 01:38:10.981]  I remember thinking, gee, how do you get bombs in a building that fast?
[01:38:11.522 --> 01:38:13.942]  It takes them weeks to rig those properly from what I've read.
[01:38:14.902 --> 01:38:19.083]  But lost in the fog, I just went back and
[01:38:21.650 --> 01:38:27.295]  Did the radio show and I remember saying, man, it looked like they blew that up the next day and blah, blah, blah.
[01:38:27.536 --> 01:38:31.079]  And then since then, I remember saying I saw it and heard it on the news.
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:32.840]  We have the news.
[01:38:32.921 --> 01:38:37.044]  We have BBC before it blew up saying it was going to collapse.
[01:38:37.084 --> 01:38:37.285]  And then.
[01:38:39.525 --> 01:38:41.487]  Saying it would collapse when it hadn't collapsed yet!
[01:38:42.247 --> 01:38:44.889]  Not one BBC, not two BBCs, three BBCs!
[01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:48.612]  And then they came out and said, Mr. Jones is lying, that video's not real.
[01:38:49.013 --> 01:38:56.559]  There was such a backlash, people went and checked their archives, they said, we apologize, that was a mistake, Reuters fed us the script.
[01:38:57.499 --> 01:38:57.960]  Exactly.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.401]  They jumped the gun.
[01:39:01.687 --> 01:39:09.894]  Two hours before it was released that it was Lee Harvey Oswald, they got time zones off in Australia and in one other country.
[01:39:10.915 --> 01:39:11.796]  What was it?
[01:39:15.019 --> 01:39:15.519]  Indonesia.
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:20.864]  And they had in the front page, because back then they had afternoon editions of newspapers that came out.
[01:39:21.224 --> 01:39:22.926]  Newspapers in big cities came out every few hours.
[01:39:23.506 --> 01:39:27.290]  Might have had 20 editions, 10 different papers in New York at the time in 1963.
[01:39:29.145 --> 01:39:33.589]  And it famously came out, Lee Harvey Oswald, before they'd even grabbed him.
[01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:35.230]  Or before his name had been released.
[01:39:35.530 --> 01:39:37.312]  Right around the time they were getting him at the movie theater.
[01:39:39.834 --> 01:39:42.776]  So, this stuff does come out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:43.057 --> 01:39:44.278]  They do screw this up.
[01:39:44.638 --> 01:39:50.503]  Because the average person at the BBC's not part of it, they're just reading a teleprompter.
[01:39:54.414 --> 01:40:01.397]  But then We Are Change London went and talked to the BBC News reporter who was talking to the reporter on the ground in front of Building 7.
[01:40:03.257 --> 01:40:06.178]  And they went to him and they said, you reported that day it had fallen before it did.
[01:40:06.198 --> 01:40:07.439]  He had this real weird look on his face.
[01:40:07.499 --> 01:40:08.019]  I've played it here.
[01:40:08.039 --> 01:40:11.140]  And he goes, no, I was going to the movies with my daughter that day.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:12.421]  I didn't cover 9-11.
[01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:14.702]  He just smiled at him.
[01:40:15.422 --> 01:40:18.203]  And they went, yeah, we have the video clip right here on our laptop.
[01:40:18.922 --> 01:40:21.143]  He said, doesn't matter, I wasn't there.
[01:40:21.663 --> 01:40:24.244]  And he smiled and walked right through him and left after his speech.
[01:40:24.905 --> 01:40:26.625]  They went to a journalist for him, I forget his name.
[01:40:28.146 --> 01:40:32.848]  You can pull it up, he's the guy talking to her from England, and she's the British reporter on the ground.
[01:40:32.868 --> 01:40:37.550]  I think her name's Jane Stanley.
[01:40:37.570 --> 01:40:43.653]  And it's just red-handed cops saying, get back, they're blowing it up.
[01:40:46.055 --> 01:40:48.358]  And I even interviewed the cops that are on that video.
[01:40:48.939 --> 01:40:49.400]  Two of them!
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.062]  And neither one would talk to me after I talked to them.
[01:40:51.082 --> 01:40:52.004]  They got so many threats.
[01:40:58.479 --> 01:41:00.680]  They said no, it was the Red Cross was in command.
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:06.741]  And they went ahead and told us, even though they were told not to tell us to get back, because they cared about the people a couple minutes before.
[01:41:07.401 --> 01:41:09.562]  And then we even heard the countdown on their radio.
[01:41:10.222 --> 01:41:11.183]  And we wondered why.
[01:41:11.503 --> 01:41:15.684]  See, the Red Cross folks is the Knights Templar, basically.
[01:41:16.584 --> 01:41:22.986]  It's the oldest continually operating intelligence agency for 500 years at least.
[01:41:23.546 --> 01:41:26.687]  The Red Cross has been operating.
[01:41:27.327 --> 01:41:27.708]  There it is.
[01:41:27.989 --> 01:41:33.623]  We Are Change UK, Phil Hayton and WTC7 if you want to see the video from 2008.
[01:41:33.663 --> 01:41:34.184]  It is bombshell.
[01:41:42.227 --> 01:41:43.288]  And then you've done a few interviews.
[01:41:43.348 --> 01:41:44.828]  Make sure that's the one where he denies it.
[01:41:44.848 --> 01:41:46.709]  Because I don't want to be the wrong woman.
[01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:47.590]  I'm sure that's it.
[01:41:48.090 --> 01:41:50.971]  He goes, no, I took my daughter to the movies that day, or my son.
[01:41:50.991 --> 01:41:51.832]  No, it was his daughter.
[01:41:52.612 --> 01:41:53.793]  I was not working on 9-11.
[01:41:54.033 --> 01:41:55.994]  Of course you would remember you were working on 9-11.
[01:41:57.134 --> 01:41:59.135]  He was on for like 10 hours that day.
[01:41:59.855 --> 01:42:02.737]  But this is how dumb they think we all are.
[01:42:03.677 --> 01:42:05.778]  This is how stupid they think you are.
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:11.201]  So now these people are about to hit us again.
[01:42:13.479 --> 01:42:30.133]  With our border wide open, and Rick Perry, who certainly has his own fair share of problems, did quietly put the state police on alert to look for radicals and killers and people with criminal records on the border.
[01:42:31.354 --> 01:42:35.318]  He did deploy the National Guard down there, and we've now learned that Obama tried to block it.
[01:42:36.707 --> 01:42:45.355]  And he is working with a group of state senators and others that we've talked to off record who knew this was basically coming two years ago and had a contingency plan ready.
[01:42:46.035 --> 01:42:50.680]  And the problem is that Obama won't even deport felons now.
[01:42:52.021 --> 01:42:57.966]  So they're filling up state facilities with these violent felons and embarrassing Obama as they're forced to release them.
[01:42:58.507 --> 01:42:59.688]  And so what's their answer?
[01:42:59.708 --> 01:43:00.689]  Just indict Rick Perry.
[01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:06.131]  In fact, we have an article I'm going to put up on screen here about Rick Perry.
[01:43:06.672 --> 01:43:10.613]  Rick Perry deletes truthful tweet concerning indictment witch hunt.
[01:43:11.673 --> 01:43:18.415]  I don't always drive drunk at three times the blood alcohol limit, even though she heads up the DWI task force, the state task force.
[01:43:19.175 --> 01:43:24.937]  But when I do, I indict Governor Rick Perry for calling me out on it.
[01:43:25.437 --> 01:43:27.358]  And I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
[01:43:27.798 --> 01:43:29.278]  One of his people tweeted that out.
[01:43:29.298 --> 01:43:30.879]  I saw that like a week ago.
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:33.621]  And then Rick Perry apologized for it.
[01:43:36.802 --> 01:43:37.802]  Rosemary Lindbergh.
[01:43:38.263 --> 01:43:51.168]  So, the governor is indicted for doing his job to veto $7.5 million of funding for the public integrity office, the state office that she headed up.
[01:43:51.488 --> 01:43:58.170]  And it turned out he tried to get Democrats for months to put another Democrat in there and have her step down just out of the public integrity office.
[01:43:58.570 --> 01:43:59.591]  She'd still be DA.
[01:44:01.434 --> 01:44:02.174]  And they said no.
[01:44:03.795 --> 01:44:04.396]  And why not?
[01:44:05.116 --> 01:44:22.107]  Because they know that if they can get away with having her in there while she's spitting and yelling and throwing fits and threatening the sheriff's deputies and acting crazy and throwing temper tantrums on the ground, kicking and screaming and looking like a piranha, they can do anything!
[01:44:22.867 --> 01:44:24.208]  If they can pass laws
[01:44:28.311 --> 01:44:33.854]  Banning even the weakest hair dryers and tea kettles and wood-burning stoves, and they've already done this in Europe.
[01:44:34.635 --> 01:44:35.495]  Now it's coming to England.
[01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.376]  It's already come to San Francisco.
[01:44:37.877 --> 01:44:39.318]  They can do anything!
[01:44:39.918 --> 01:44:42.299]  You want to have GMO crops, glyphosate in the water supply?
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:42.820]  Fine!
[01:44:45.063 --> 01:44:47.864]  Look at this political correctness, then I'll get to this report and give the number out.
[01:44:47.884 --> 01:44:49.985]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:44:50.765 --> 01:44:53.146]  I haven't given it out yet.
[01:44:53.407 --> 01:44:54.407]  The phones are now open.
[01:44:54.947 --> 01:44:56.608]  First-time callers, 800-259-9231.
[01:44:57.388 --> 01:45:03.811]  I want to cover any of these points I've thrown out.
[01:45:03.831 --> 01:45:04.611]  I want your take on it.
[01:45:07.132 --> 01:45:10.074]  How fear of being seen as racist stops social workers
[01:45:11.326 --> 01:45:17.289]  Saving up to 1,400 children from sexual exploitation at the hands of Asian men in just one town.
[01:45:17.649 --> 01:45:25.734]  Turns out it's an entire network of taking the kids all over the country, out of the country, in savage gang rape rooms.
[01:45:29.316 --> 01:45:30.977]  Eleven-year-old girls and boys.
[01:45:32.337 --> 01:45:34.779]  But because they were Pakistani,
[01:45:35.788 --> 01:45:38.510]  It was politically incorrect.
[01:45:39.150 --> 01:45:40.071]  Well, it's more than that.
[01:45:40.111 --> 01:45:41.852]  The British government's full of this stuff as well.
[01:45:43.493 --> 01:45:45.995]  And that's all over the British news last week.
[01:45:50.158 --> 01:45:52.079]  But it's not real political correctness.
[01:45:52.339 --> 01:45:52.640]  It's that...
[01:45:53.507 --> 01:45:58.129]  They're setting the precedent, well I'm sorry, if they're gang raping 11 year olds, we can't do anything because they're Asian.
[01:45:58.670 --> 01:46:01.571]  We're sorry, we can't have anything on the border because you'd be racist.
[01:46:01.971 --> 01:46:03.852]  We have to give you everything free because you're Hispanic.
[01:46:03.932 --> 01:46:06.754]  They're not going to give you anything free when they're done taking over, folks.
[01:46:07.034 --> 01:46:11.076]  This is just mindlessness of, be socially nice, do what we say!
[01:46:13.257 --> 01:46:17.439]  Or, we'll call you racist, you gotta call them on the bluff and say, call me racist.
[01:46:17.579 --> 01:46:19.100]  Fine, go ahead, I don't care.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:22.442]  You are a race pimp, race hustling fraud.
[01:46:27.148 --> 01:46:35.671]  I mean, Saudi Arabians for at least five years don't get groped, don't have to take their turbans off, their women don't have to take their headdresses off, their burkas.
[01:46:35.691 --> 01:46:40.632]  But because of lawsuits and stuff, they're not supposed to grope under 12-year-olds.
[01:46:40.652 --> 01:46:42.493]  They still try to grab my kids when I fly.
[01:46:44.349 --> 01:46:45.351]  I've now flown some with them.
[01:46:45.371 --> 01:46:46.011]  They've flown some.
[01:46:46.692 --> 01:46:48.455]  And it's just like, oh no, we're putting them through.
[01:46:48.475 --> 01:46:50.718]  And it's like, no, you're not supposed to.
[01:46:50.818 --> 01:46:51.379]  Send them over there.
[01:46:51.399 --> 01:46:53.302]  And they're like, six TSA run over.
[01:46:53.322 --> 01:46:54.123]  What's your problem?
[01:46:54.444 --> 01:46:56.487]  I'm like, my problem is you guys aren't supposed to do this.
[01:46:57.128 --> 01:46:59.091]  And then I'm very calm and get their manager over there.
[01:46:59.909 --> 01:47:01.090]  But it's just a joke.
[01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:02.531]  You want to check baby diapers?
[01:47:03.011 --> 01:47:05.353]  But illegals get to fly with no ID.
[01:47:05.673 --> 01:47:07.174]  The Saudi Arabians get to go through.
[01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:08.035]  It's a joke.
[01:47:08.295 --> 01:47:09.296]  We're a joke.
[01:47:09.356 --> 01:47:12.178]  The government and the criminal elites laugh at us.
[01:47:12.918 --> 01:47:15.480]  They are indicting Republican governors all over the country.
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:18.162]  They're indicting people for filmmakers.
[01:47:18.222 --> 01:47:18.722]  You name it.
[01:47:19.483 --> 01:47:21.564]  And it's not that the Republicans are even good.
[01:47:21.805 --> 01:47:23.766]  The Democrats are getting rid of their competition.
[01:47:25.167 --> 01:47:27.329]  One ring to rule them all in the darkness.
[01:47:27.369 --> 01:47:27.729]  Bind them.
[01:47:29.011 --> 01:47:35.793]  They are going after anybody that doesn't toe the line with exactly what they want.
[01:47:35.813 --> 01:47:36.653]  They're going for broke.
[01:47:36.673 --> 01:47:43.355]  And we have a clip of Joe Biden screaming, it's time to take America back.
[01:47:43.415 --> 01:47:47.636]  Again, if you use the term, it's time to take America back, the Democrats had said, that's racist.
[01:47:47.936 --> 01:47:48.096]  Why?
[01:47:48.156 --> 01:47:58.499]  You mean take it back from us socialists as you mean from the minorities, because they formed it into a minority movement as a majority that we're going to get whitey.
[01:48:00.157 --> 01:48:02.579]  And so then people say, take America back for the Second Amendment.
[01:48:02.719 --> 01:48:04.220]  Oh, you mean you don't like black people?
[01:48:04.721 --> 01:48:09.085]  Biden uses take back America phrase, Obama and Holder think is racist.
[01:48:09.445 --> 01:48:10.426]  Let's play that clip.
[01:48:10.446 --> 01:48:15.750]  It's time to take back America, as we say.
[01:48:16.951 --> 01:48:19.053]  It's time to change the tax code.
[01:48:19.453 --> 01:48:22.436]  It's time to make sure you get equal share.
[01:48:22.896 --> 01:48:27.200]  Because ladies and gentlemen, if you don't, if we don't, America
[01:48:27.976 --> 01:48:28.997]  America's in trouble.
[01:48:29.737 --> 01:48:33.120]  And we've always done best when we act as one America.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.781]  Everybody in the deal.
[01:48:35.061 --> 01:48:35.942]  Everybody.
[01:48:36.742 --> 01:48:46.309]  And as long as I'm around, as long as the guys behind me are around, we're going to fight with every breath in us to make sure we reestablish the bargain.
[01:48:46.329 --> 01:48:47.430]  God bless you.
[01:48:51.444 --> 01:49:00.971]  While they passed Obamacare with 7 taxes on blue collar workers, 20 plus total taxes, I told you it was a tax, it was ruled as a tax.
[01:49:05.630 --> 01:49:10.371]  Because I know what they've done tax-wise with the Republicans, and they've increased taxes in this country.
[01:49:10.911 --> 01:49:12.871]  And they've got all these other taxes and regulations.
[01:49:13.391 --> 01:49:22.013]  And so he goes back to Roosevelt, chicken in every pot, fair share, hey, the contract's not broken, we're going to give you the good deal.
[01:49:23.173 --> 01:49:24.113]  America's in trouble.
[01:49:24.493 --> 01:49:25.894]  I thought America was great, Joe.
[01:49:26.294 --> 01:49:27.594]  Obama says it's wonderful.
[01:49:28.334 --> 01:49:32.615]  Even though Hagel, the Secretary of Defense, says we're in a global meltdown, which we are,
[01:49:35.509 --> 01:49:44.474]  The globalists think they're like Slim Pickens, you know, Dr. Strangelove, riding the hydrogen bomb down like a buck and bronco, and you're not.
[01:49:44.534 --> 01:49:49.416]  You people are smoking your own dope, believing your own propaganda, you're out of control.
[01:49:49.476 --> 01:50:02.003]  And I'm going to make sure that if, God forbid, Al Qaeda blows up some college or some school or some military base in the next week or two, I'm going to make sure, and we're going to make sure,
[01:50:03.069 --> 01:50:08.993]  That everybody knows you're behind it opening up those borders, and that you're behind it funding ISIS overseas.
[01:50:09.374 --> 01:50:10.755]  I am sick of it!
[01:50:11.595 --> 01:50:18.300]  And I am not going to sit here and have my children's future ruined, and my freedoms taken by you pack of crazy people!
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:29.248]  Let me tell you something, I studied politics, I studied world history, and it didn't matter if it was some of the Roman Caesars, or Napoleon, or Hitler, or Pol Pot, they go crazy.
[01:50:30.563 --> 01:50:31.343]  It's criminology.
[01:50:31.364 --> 01:50:32.104]  They want to get caught.
[01:50:32.124 --> 01:50:32.924]  They want to get in trouble.
[01:50:33.165 --> 01:50:34.886]  They do more and more and more and more and more and more.
[01:50:35.866 --> 01:50:38.228]  Just subconsciously, why aren't I getting caught?
[01:50:38.308 --> 01:50:39.288]  Why is no one stopping me?
[01:50:39.308 --> 01:50:40.309]  It's like a bad kid.
[01:50:41.987 --> 01:50:42.847]  Out of control kid.
[01:50:43.428 --> 01:50:46.109]  Pretty soon the kid's running around crapping in the hallways.
[01:50:46.989 --> 01:50:48.229]  I've read about that in psychology.
[01:50:48.409 --> 01:50:49.470]  Not my kid's thing, Kevin.
[01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:52.691]  What's happening at the EPA and other federal agencies is an epidemic.
[01:50:53.131 --> 01:50:54.391]  Defecating in the hallways.
[01:50:54.651 --> 01:50:56.452]  Drawing on the walls with their feces.
[01:50:57.072 --> 01:51:02.534]  It's a bunch of crazy mental patients running things who just want to screw up anybody normal.
[01:51:02.714 --> 01:51:04.435]  They want to just screw up society.
[01:51:04.575 --> 01:51:06.075]  They're deviant filth!
[01:51:06.736 --> 01:51:07.476]  They're vandals!

[01:52:09.641 --> 01:52:14.523]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:52:14.603 --> 01:52:17.244]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:52:17.284 --> 01:52:24.068]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?

[01:52:32.292 --> 01:52:35.133]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.

[01:54:21.954 --> 01:54:23.275]  We're going right to your phone calls.
[01:54:23.315 --> 01:54:31.664]  I was able to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor, head editor of the Wall Street Journal, father of Reaganomics, head of policy, Department of Treasury.
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:36.361]  We're on to talk about the Russia situation, but we'll continue with your calls.
[01:54:36.901 --> 01:54:40.301]  We're going to go to Sarah and Walt and Blake and Curtis and Danny and others.
[01:54:40.882 --> 01:54:42.962]  Then there's articles like this one from months ago.
[01:54:43.862 --> 01:54:49.243]  Land grab, local officials blast, moved by Obama to set aside half a million acres in New Mexico.
[01:54:49.703 --> 01:54:51.504]  Even police aren't allowed to go in.
[01:54:51.984 --> 01:54:54.184]  No one is allowed to go into the quote monument.
[01:54:54.904 --> 01:54:56.265]  See, this is all UN stuff.
[01:54:56.945 --> 01:55:01.946]  We warned you back when I made that film in 97, America Destroyed by Design, that the plan was
[01:55:03.246 --> 01:55:06.869]  As the feds grab more land to make it totally off-limits to everybody, even hiking.
[01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.891]  And now they've done that.
[01:55:11.373 --> 01:55:13.414]  And of course it's an illegal alien corridor they're using.
[01:55:15.776 --> 01:55:17.177]  I mean, it's just the sky's the limit!
[01:55:17.738 --> 01:55:19.279]  They get away with anything, why not?
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:26.104]  Please remember that I have not plugged any of the products, books, videos, supplements, the last hour of 55 minutes.
[01:55:26.404 --> 01:55:27.625]  That's how we fund our operation.

[01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:15.650]  Sarah, thanks for calling in today.
[01:56:16.311 --> 01:56:19.033]  So much is going on, the world's being destabilized.
[01:56:19.333 --> 01:56:20.194]  What's your take on it?
[01:56:21.335 --> 01:56:23.236]  Hi Alex, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
[01:56:23.316 --> 01:56:28.580]  I've been listening for six plus years and this is the first time I've ever gotten through calling.
[01:56:30.086 --> 01:56:39.894]  I think as a 23-year-old young lady, I can look at society and when I first started listening, I took a look at the bank bailout and was like, wow, this is not right.
[01:56:39.994 --> 01:56:43.257]  Even at 17, I realized this isn't the right way.
[01:56:43.317 --> 01:56:48.301]  So I started listening and started looking stuff up and really became aware of what's going on around me.
[01:56:48.741 --> 01:56:53.345]  I feel like most people, especially in rural communities, know exactly what's happening to them.
[01:56:54.025 --> 01:56:57.228]  So really, I called to ask you a question is what can we do as
[01:56:58.647 --> 01:57:14.383]  Like, as communities, as people that are so friendly with each other on things like Facebook and Twitter where you fake know people but you don't actually talk to them, you don't exchange real ideas, you just say one-liners that get you by as far as societal points go.
[01:57:14.403 --> 01:57:17.146]  You get high-fives for saying the right thing.
[01:57:17.366 --> 01:57:22.050]  It's all simulated fake social stuff that doesn't even help you or your family or them.
[01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:24.653]  That's why you want real meaningful relationships.
[01:57:24.973 --> 01:57:26.074]  You want to buy local.
[01:57:26.454 --> 01:57:29.697]  You want to realize our culture of just basic freedom is under attack.
[01:57:30.057 --> 01:57:38.885]  That all race, colors, and creeds should unite around private property, not being surveilled, having due process, basic prosperity.
[01:57:38.965 --> 01:57:41.207]  And you point out the globalists are the enemies.
[01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:43.630]  They're the ones occupying the country.
[01:57:44.250 --> 01:57:45.552]  Expose the occupation.
[01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:47.494]  Expose the global government plan.
[01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:52.400]  Expose that things are about to get a lot worse because the New World Order is behind it.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:57.185]  They're going to try to pose as saviors as the next phase of their operation comes in.
[01:57:57.545 --> 01:58:00.008]  Realize the Homeland Security Department of Defense run
[01:58:01.249 --> 01:58:08.336]  Rural Affairs Commission is meant to bankrupt and then take control in the bankruptcy of all rural areas.
[01:58:08.856 --> 01:58:11.959]  Realize they're taking land and property right use everywhere.
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:24.831]  Realize that we've all got to buck the system, say no to stuff that's unconstitutional, while backing local officials and public servants that do stand for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:58:25.592 --> 01:58:31.717]  Not the government's perfect, or even they're perfect, but if somebody's promoting basic freedom, isn't a criminal, back them.
[01:58:32.357 --> 01:58:34.079]  If somebody's a crook, go after them.
[01:58:34.679 --> 01:58:35.440]  Get aggressive.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:36.361]  Don't comply.
[01:58:37.001 --> 01:58:38.002]  Stand up for yourself.
[01:58:38.102 --> 01:58:38.983]  Become Americans.
[01:58:39.303 --> 01:58:40.924]  Discover the liberty culture again.
[01:58:41.645 --> 01:58:46.088]  And these tyrants will vanish like vampires at dawn, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson.
[01:58:46.548 --> 01:58:48.210]  More calls, 70 seconds away.
[01:58:48.590 --> 01:58:54.283]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the economy, Russia, ISIS threat and more straight ahead as well.
[01:58:54.563 --> 01:58:57.770]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com!
[01:58:59.249 --> 01:59:06.152]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[01:59:28.837 --> 01:59:32.338]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:59:32.499 --> 01:59:36.460]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:38.241]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:59:38.561 --> 01:59:46.144]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:59:46.404 --> 01:59:47.265]  But for how long?
[01:59:47.565 --> 01:59:53.828]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:59:54.188 --> 01:59:57.009]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:00:01.727 --> 02:00:03.652]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.113 --> 02:00:06.920]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:14.676 --> 02:00:18.858]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.498 --> 02:00:20.298]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.058 --> 02:00:21.959]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.619 --> 02:00:26.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:30.922]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.982 --> 02:00:42.026]  Taking your phone calls right now, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is popping in, then back to your calls.
[02:00:44.730 --> 02:00:46.791]  A lady was just asking me, how do we defeat this system?
[02:00:46.851 --> 02:00:47.311]  You buck.
[02:00:47.411 --> 02:00:49.052]  Everything they're doing is centralized.
[02:00:49.892 --> 02:00:55.735]  Michelle Obama, the federal government, want to run a scam with stuff not fit for prisoners to eat with our children?
[02:00:56.075 --> 02:01:02.519]  From Illinois to North Carolina, from Texas to California, the school districts are just ending the school lunch program, period.
[02:01:03.319 --> 02:01:05.400]  Realizing it's a total controlled paradigm.
[02:01:07.222 --> 02:01:12.424]  In school district, Illinois school district, looks to dump Michelle O's lunch program.
[02:01:12.764 --> 02:01:15.545]  Program causes massive drop in lunch sales.
[02:01:15.885 --> 02:01:17.746]  People packaging and bringing their own food.
[02:01:19.766 --> 02:01:23.728]  Their answer, the Democrats, is don't let people pack their children's lunches.
[02:01:24.008 --> 02:01:26.329]  It's just total prison economy.
[02:01:26.389 --> 02:01:31.230]  Live in a big re-education camp run by these criminals while they fly around on jumbo jets and are on red carpets.
[02:01:33.131 --> 02:01:35.232]  I can't even look at that snapping turtle woman anymore.
[02:01:36.309 --> 02:01:37.816]  Let's talk to Walt in New York.
[02:01:37.836 --> 02:01:38.701]  Thanks for calling, Walt.
[02:01:39.878 --> 02:01:40.778]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[02:01:41.058 --> 02:01:41.519]  Good, brother.
[02:01:41.539 --> 02:01:42.019]  Thanks for calling.
[02:01:42.759 --> 02:01:48.922]  Alex, I'm going to bring up a subject here that's tied in with everything you're talking about, a broad range of subjects, and I hope you see how it ties in.
[02:01:49.762 --> 02:02:00.346]  Obama is about to sign an executive order that will take the wolf off of the endangered species list, and they're going to have a hunt in Idaho where they're going to basically exterminate the wolves.
[02:02:00.366 --> 02:02:02.167]  They're going to kill 80 to 90 percent of them.
[02:02:02.367 --> 02:02:03.608]  They may not ever recover.
[02:02:03.908 --> 02:02:06.929]  And this is all done, you know, while people are distracted with other things.
[02:02:07.229 --> 02:02:08.710]  Where are people's basic heart?
[02:02:10.170 --> 02:02:17.697]  Well, that's being done as a stunt to act like Hillary's saying she's pro-gun now and doesn't like Obama.
[02:02:18.158 --> 02:02:21.321]  It's getting her position to run and she'll act like Sarah Palin.
[02:02:22.362 --> 02:02:25.945]  At the same time, I do understand.
[02:02:26.025 --> 02:02:28.267]  I like canine familiarists.
[02:02:28.348 --> 02:02:29.248]  I'm a big dog lover.
[02:02:30.169 --> 02:02:33.250]  There are areas where the wolves have become overpopulated again.
[02:02:33.651 --> 02:02:37.312]  I really don't know the details to be able to properly speak to that.
[02:02:37.332 --> 02:02:40.654]  I was not aware that Obama was even set to sign that executive order.
[02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:55.560]  You know this is something that is going under the radar because there's so many things going on at one time and the basic tactic seems to be to get people distracted with one thing and then do something else and people just can't keep up.
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:57.701]  But if people would attend to their basic
[02:02:58.221 --> 02:03:01.284]  Humanity and just their basic gut level feelings.
[02:03:01.324 --> 02:03:03.606]  You know, it says, live and let live.
[02:03:03.686 --> 02:03:06.448]  It says, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
[02:03:06.628 --> 02:03:09.091]  These basic truths will serve us.
[02:03:09.151 --> 02:03:15.456]  And since we as a civilization have given up these basic truths, we're just drifting into God knows what.
[02:03:15.656 --> 02:03:24.684]  I mean, the whole 20th century is a story of how the Christian ethic, regardless of whatever your true actual religion is, how the Christian ethic has been just
[02:03:25.324 --> 02:03:34.807]  It's certainly true that fraud and corruption is up, that people are becoming more and more decadent, more and more fly-by-night, and that's pretty much a symptom of our prosperity.
[02:03:36.388 --> 02:03:38.089]  But now we're living on borrowed time.
[02:03:38.129 --> 02:03:39.269]  That's how it always ends up.
[02:03:39.949 --> 02:03:43.991]  So I'm really worried, once the bottom falls out, how all these spoiled, rotten people are going to behave.
[02:03:45.011 --> 02:03:47.532]  I appreciate your call, Walt, and I'm on no high horse.
[02:03:47.852 --> 02:03:52.053]  I'm pretty decadent and spoiled compared to the work ethic of my ancestors.
[02:03:55.825 --> 02:03:58.486]  I'll tell you, it's a fascinating world.
[02:03:59.266 --> 02:04:01.167]  Blake, in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[02:04:01.187 --> 02:04:01.787]  Thanks for holding.
[02:04:03.087 --> 02:04:03.928]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:04:04.288 --> 02:04:04.608]  Go ahead.
[02:04:04.768 --> 02:04:05.748]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:04:05.808 --> 02:04:07.969]  I'm from Oklahoma, so I'm just right here north.
[02:04:09.149 --> 02:04:15.571]  And it is very frightening to see everything unfolding just one state north of you.
[02:04:15.591 --> 02:04:24.734]  I was doing a delivery job for a while, and every hotel I went to, there were Mexican families with Mexican children.
[02:04:25.703 --> 02:04:26.443]  Every single one.
[02:04:27.344 --> 02:04:30.806]  And they all were in the U-Haul trucks and the Ryder trucks.
[02:04:30.886 --> 02:04:37.530]  And so, you know, I just, you could just tell that, you know, they were from what you're talking about.
[02:04:37.590 --> 02:04:38.891]  There is a total exodus.
[02:04:38.951 --> 02:04:48.937]  I mean, if you're at a Home Depot or a McDonald's parking lot by a gas station or on the hike and bike trail, there's just literally just like vagabonds
[02:04:50.299 --> 02:05:02.786]  Actual migrating hordes out of Central and South America, not even Mexico, with Mexican or Guatemalan plates, and the borders wide open when ISIS is supposedly about to hit us any minute.
[02:05:03.366 --> 02:05:05.547]  And again, the TSA sticks their hands down our pants.
[02:05:06.008 --> 02:05:07.288]  This is meant to collapse the country.
[02:05:07.328 --> 02:05:07.608]  Stay there.
[02:05:07.628 --> 02:05:08.169]  I'm gonna come back to you.
[02:05:08.897 --> 02:05:19.099]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:05:19.459 --> 02:05:25.520]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:28.140]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[02:06:14.125 --> 02:06:20.308]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[02:06:20.608 --> 02:06:28.672]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[02:06:28.992 --> 02:06:30.073]  Open your eyes.

[02:07:00.402 --> 02:07:01.042]  Open your eyes.
[02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:14.494]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:14.694 --> 02:07:18.896]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:19.256 --> 02:07:23.819]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:24.239 --> 02:07:26.860]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:32.342]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:32.603 --> 02:07:39.485]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:07:39.986 --> 02:07:43.767]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:07:44.127 --> 02:07:48.909]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:49.230 --> 02:07:50.090]  This is innovating.
[02:07:50.370 --> 02:07:57.675]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:07:57.835 --> 02:08:01.918]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:08:02.118 --> 02:08:07.361]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:07.501 --> 02:08:19.990]  I wanna tell you about Texas radio and the Big B.
[02:08:26.073 --> 02:08:36.438]  If you are receiving this transmission live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you are the resistance.
[02:08:36.478 --> 02:08:37.619]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:57.998 --> 02:09:01.882]  And bringing us in is Dave Mustaine's The Four Horsemen.
[02:09:02.722 --> 02:09:03.283]  Metallica.
[02:09:04.704 --> 02:09:09.188]  You know, I'm friends with Dave Mustaine and he's just such an amazing musician and songwriter.
[02:09:09.208 --> 02:09:10.830]  One of the best guitarists in the world.
[02:09:11.230 --> 02:09:12.111]  I know he listens every day.
[02:09:12.131 --> 02:09:15.714]  I want to give a shout out to Dave and Pam and the rest of his family.
[02:09:17.095 --> 02:09:19.898]  Justice and Elektra and Pam and everybody.
[02:09:20.699 --> 02:09:21.820]  But let's crank it up for just a moment.
[02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:24.122]  The Horsemen are drawing near.
[02:09:25.771 --> 02:09:27.092]  They come to take your life.
[02:09:28.233 --> 02:09:32.137]  You know, Dave wrote most of Kill Em All and a lot of Ride the Lightning.
[02:09:32.257 --> 02:09:37.461]  I think that's why it was a little bit sour when they threw him out of Metallica.
[02:09:37.481 --> 02:09:40.564]  Because the whole sound, the music, the songs, everything.
[02:09:40.584 --> 02:09:41.185]  State of Mustang.
[02:09:42.892 --> 02:09:44.713]  And he's real nice about it and everything now.
[02:09:44.733 --> 02:09:47.736]  But then I still see Metallica make little flippant comments.
[02:09:48.797 --> 02:09:49.697]  And I like Metallica.
[02:09:49.717 --> 02:09:52.679]  One time I got invited out to actually get one of the events they were at to meet them.
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:54.020]  And I'm sure they're great.
[02:09:54.061 --> 02:09:55.181]  I love all of Metallica.
[02:09:56.122 --> 02:10:00.245]  It's just that... I was clicking the other day listening to Kill Em All.
[02:10:01.066 --> 02:10:02.247]  And I was realizing, wow.
[02:10:03.147 --> 02:10:05.209]  Didn't Dave Mustaine write all this and the music and everything?
[02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:05.769]  I went and looked it up.
[02:10:05.789 --> 02:10:06.270]  Yeah, sure enough.
[02:10:12.248 --> 02:10:13.469]  Leather steeds they ride.
[02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:25.774]  You know, I meant to play that intro because we're talking about such serious World War III type news, then I go off and do a history lesson on some of the greats out there of heavy rock or heavy metal.
[02:10:28.535 --> 02:10:29.196]  Oh yeah!
[02:10:30.236 --> 02:10:34.338]  Let me just reset and get serious here for just a moment.
[02:10:35.666 --> 02:10:37.047]  Again, I am your host Alex Jones.
[02:10:37.067 --> 02:10:40.448]  At the bottom of the hour, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to be joining us.
[02:10:40.468 --> 02:10:44.270]  Then we'll go back to your calls on a bunch of news I've not yet gotten to.
[02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:58.798]  Our reporters are about to be in the air from Austin down to El Paso, where the border is still, we've confirmed from our military sources, wide open with ISIS saying that they're going to attack and Homeland Security saying it is imminent.
[02:10:59.558 --> 02:11:00.219]  Imminent attack.
[02:11:00.259 --> 02:11:02.660]  Now we saw lots of fake terror alerts and stuff like that before.
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:06.422]  ISIS is a real group being funded and protected.
[02:11:07.163 --> 02:11:15.591]  But regardless, when they attack, they were funded and protected to attack Syria and other countries in a proxy war against Russia in the last four years.
[02:11:16.031 --> 02:11:17.172]  That's now been confirmed.
[02:11:17.232 --> 02:11:18.733]  Senator Ted Cruz has gone public.
[02:11:19.114 --> 02:11:22.337]  Rand Paul went public and stopped it a year ago, along with the general public.
[02:11:24.312 --> 02:11:34.120]  Now they're back, and we have polls out today out of Gallup and others showing a majority wanting strikes in Syria and Iraq because of ISIS, the very group protected by the West.
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:38.543]  The very groups they've been using in Chechnya and other areas to attack Russian interests.
[02:11:38.804 --> 02:11:41.946]  And I'm no Russian file, I'm no... never been to Russia.
[02:11:42.987 --> 02:11:43.587]  But I've studied it.
[02:11:44.548 --> 02:11:47.931]  And Russia is not in an offensive posture starting things right now.
[02:11:49.226 --> 02:11:50.887]  Now I'll tell you who is an expert on Russia.
[02:11:50.907 --> 02:12:03.891]  He was part of the negotiations for the fall of the Soviet Union as the head of policy of the father of Reaganomics, Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts, also the former editor of the Wall Street Journal and a best-selling author and top economist.
[02:12:04.671 --> 02:12:09.213]  I want to get into the latest because NATO has already been deploying troops and weapons and they've already got advisors.
[02:12:09.593 --> 02:12:14.075]  Undoubtedly there are some Russian troops in eastern Ukraine to guard their infrastructure and military bases.
[02:12:14.095 --> 02:12:14.895]  That's been on record.
[02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:19.511]  NATO weighs rapid response force for Eastern Europe.
[02:12:20.391 --> 02:12:28.017]  I will take Kiev in two weeks, or I could take Kiev in two weeks, says Vladimir Putin, in that two and a half hour talk he gave, but they're saying that was taken out of context.
[02:12:28.557 --> 02:12:38.144]  Regardless, Russia is hardening its stance, and last time Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was on, he was talking about how he's gonna rock in a hard place.
[02:12:38.344 --> 02:12:39.905]  If Russia, if Putin,
[02:12:40.826 --> 02:12:46.910]  Offensively takes part of Ukraine, which NATO's already done, taking over the country in their coup of six months ago.
[02:12:47.351 --> 02:12:48.432]  He'll be called a warmonger.
[02:12:49.012 --> 02:12:51.994]  If he doesn't, Russian hardliners will come after him.
[02:12:52.334 --> 02:13:02.101]  Now we have the former deputy head of the CIA coming out last week and saying, you kill Putin or we're going to basically attack you to the Russian government.
[02:13:02.662 --> 02:13:03.322]  Or we'll kill him.
[02:13:03.882 --> 02:13:07.085]  Incredible provocations on Fox News.
[02:13:08.115 --> 02:13:11.697]  So, this is not Iraq we're kicking around here, okay?
[02:13:12.617 --> 02:13:20.561]  This is Russia, and Putin reminded last week that they have a rapid response, high-tech, compact nuclear weapons system.
[02:13:20.942 --> 02:13:31.327]  So with that set up, because some stations only carry the third hour, I bring you Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us via video Skype to look at this, the ISIS threat, and the economy in the time we have.
[02:13:31.387 --> 02:13:32.928]  Dr. Roberts, thank you for joining us.
[02:13:32.948 --> 02:13:35.129]  It's a pleasure, Alex.
[02:13:36.547 --> 02:13:37.127]  Where to begin?
[02:13:37.167 --> 02:13:38.629]  It just gets crazier by the moment.
[02:13:40.030 --> 02:13:41.251]  It really is crazy.
[02:13:43.012 --> 02:13:49.617]  It's not clear to me, Alex, what the United States thinks it's up to trying to start a war with Russia.
[02:13:50.658 --> 02:13:59.605]  And it's not clear to me why the idiots in the European capitals would go along with it, since they certainly would cease to exist very quickly.
[02:14:00.546 --> 02:14:03.568]  So what is the basis of all this?
[02:14:03.668 --> 02:14:04.609]  It's just hard to know.
[02:14:05.382 --> 02:14:07.864]  I mean, I know the neoconservatives are crazy.
[02:14:08.224 --> 02:14:10.786]  In fact, I would say that they're insane.
[02:14:11.607 --> 02:14:22.796]  But it's hard to see why they think that they can make forces in the Baltics or Poland or wherever a threat to Russia.
[02:14:22.856 --> 02:14:23.757]  They can't do that.
[02:14:24.317 --> 02:14:26.959]  It's just not possible.
[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:29.502]  So what is all this about?
[02:14:29.602 --> 02:14:31.583]  It's a lot of propaganda.
[02:14:31.623 --> 02:14:34.786]  And as you said correctly, it is extremely provocative.
[02:14:36.152 --> 02:14:43.340]  And I think what I'll have to say about this is that the United States is the government in Washington.
[02:14:44.415 --> 02:14:58.362]  is terrified that the Europeans are developing economic and political relationships with Russia that would pull eventually NATO countries out of Washington's orbit.
[02:14:58.862 --> 02:15:06.846]  The NATO would be dissolved and that the American hedge enemy over the world would simply cease to exist.
[02:15:06.906 --> 02:15:10.888]  And so they're trying to provoke the Russians into an action
[02:15:12.222 --> 02:15:19.946]  That Washington can use to browbeat the Europeans and convince them that, look, Russia's dangerous, Russia's dangerous.
[02:15:19.986 --> 02:15:21.687]  You need us to protect you.
[02:15:21.707 --> 02:15:23.068]  You can't do without us.
[02:15:24.009 --> 02:15:30.632]  And to force a break in the economic relationships between Europe and Russia.
[02:15:30.732 --> 02:15:33.974]  I think that's what this game plan is.
[02:15:34.834 --> 02:15:39.117]  So far, Putin has not sent troops to the Ukraine.
[02:15:39.737 --> 02:15:41.058]  We're good to go.
[02:15:54.850 --> 02:15:56.011]  Not Russia.
[02:15:56.672 --> 02:16:06.762]  And so he's waiting for the Europeans to finally see that Washington's crazy and to disassociate from Washington's leadership.
[02:16:07.142 --> 02:16:10.065]  So I think that's essentially what it is.
[02:16:10.585 --> 02:16:14.910]  And because they haven't been able to stir Putin into action,
[02:16:15.882 --> 02:16:17.302]  They're getting more and more shrill.
[02:16:17.402 --> 02:16:34.007]  They, meaning Washington, is getting more and more shrill, pumping up its mouthpieces more and more, and making the wildest kinds of accusations that just ordinary people are beginning to see through.
[02:16:34.047 --> 02:16:35.828]  You don't really have to know too much.
[02:16:36.708 --> 02:16:45.670]  To understand that if there were Russian military units in Ukraine, or if Russia invaded Ukraine, the war would be over instantly.
[02:16:45.690 --> 02:16:47.691]  There wouldn't be any government in Kiev.
[02:16:48.451 --> 02:16:50.111]  The whole country would be occupied.
[02:16:50.171 --> 02:16:51.712]  It would only take a few hours.
[02:16:52.472 --> 02:16:56.173]  So, people keep talking about a Russian invasion.
[02:16:56.633 --> 02:16:57.593]  It's not possible.
[02:16:59.034 --> 02:17:03.275]  If the Russians were to invade, that would be the end of the Ukraine.
[02:17:03.315 --> 02:17:04.535]  It would happen very quickly.
[02:17:05.365 --> 02:17:09.187]  They have no capability of resisting the Russian military.
[02:17:09.847 --> 02:17:15.909]  And so, people, it's beginning to dawn on people that this simply is not so.
[02:17:16.089 --> 02:17:19.791]  So how it plays out, I don't know.
[02:17:19.851 --> 02:17:24.172]  How much will Washington pay its puppets to sell out their own country?
[02:17:24.192 --> 02:17:24.472]  Well, I agree.
[02:17:24.512 --> 02:17:25.673]  I think it's more than paying them off.
[02:17:25.733 --> 02:17:29.794]  It's been confirmed, as you've talked about for a long time, that William Benny is exposed to it at the NSA.
[02:17:31.295 --> 02:17:36.696]  They are blackmailing and targeting basically everybody with these snoop systems.
[02:17:37.277 --> 02:17:41.958]  And they can turn hackers loose on people, plant stuff on your computer, you name it.
[02:17:42.538 --> 02:17:50.780]  Anybody that doesn't go along with this gets demonized in the media, gets set up, gets arrested, gets demonized, gets persecuted.
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:52.041]  Look at all the IRS stuff.
[02:17:52.621 --> 02:17:56.142]  It is just a gangsterism.
[02:17:56.642 --> 02:17:56.882]  Yeah.
[02:17:57.970 --> 02:17:59.491]  It's a fascist police state.
[02:18:00.091 --> 02:18:02.133]  That's what our country has become, Alex.
[02:18:03.113 --> 02:18:07.336]  I want to be specific from our sources and also the Russian news, but also the Ukrainian news.
[02:18:07.637 --> 02:18:21.166]  There are some Russian troops at bases that have been there for hundreds of years, both naval and army, and they have been protecting some of their border checkpoints and have been having soldiers bring in convoys of food who have then been arrested.
[02:18:22.447 --> 02:18:33.980]  Uh, but then to say that that's an offensive Russian force going out and trying to, you know, take Ukraine and he's invaded every two or three days, the president of Ukraine says that.
[02:18:35.021 --> 02:18:42.309]  I hearken back to 2008, uh, when I woke up and saw CNN saying Russia has invaded Georgia and I was still naive in 2008.
[02:18:44.252 --> 02:18:46.813]  I went to my wife, honey, Russia's invaded, they're crazy.
[02:18:47.353 --> 02:18:56.435]  And then later, hours later, it came out, no, actually, Georgia attacked the Russian bases on the border in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and the Russians came and kicked them out.
[02:18:56.655 --> 02:18:58.076]  But our media is so 1984.
[02:18:58.316 --> 02:19:02.537]  I mean, I've studied North Korean propaganda.
[02:19:02.637 --> 02:19:06.998]  It's about the only propaganda that's sillier and just more over-the-top than ours.
[02:19:08.972 --> 02:19:12.594]  Yes, I'm not even sure the North Korean one is worse, but you're right.
[02:19:12.634 --> 02:19:16.835]  Did you see that Washington Post editorial on August 31st?
[02:19:17.476 --> 02:19:18.956]  About, was Putin right?
[02:19:19.576 --> 02:19:28.000]  About Putin being a liar, and he's deceiving the world, and he's a maniac, and he's... Did you see that?
[02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:29.200]  Yes, I saw that one too.
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:31.921]  Then I saw another one saying, was he right in Syria?
[02:19:32.241 --> 02:19:34.362]  So it's almost a schizophrenia we're seeing.
[02:19:36.127 --> 02:19:41.051]  Well, we don't have any media except online.
[02:19:44.153 --> 02:19:50.838]  You provide far more real news than the New York Times or CNN or any of them all added up.
[02:19:51.758 --> 02:19:56.161]  So the only media the West has is the alternative media.
[02:19:57.002 --> 02:19:59.344]  The rest of it is a ministry of propaganda.
[02:20:00.981 --> 02:20:04.543]  Let me ask you your view on a raft of issues quickly.
[02:20:04.784 --> 02:20:15.611]  Again, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, top economist, joins us, a high-level Reagan administration official as well, and also worked with the downfall of Russia, so he is aware of a lot of different angles here.
[02:20:16.191 --> 02:20:20.214]  When we look at the economy, we got Joe Biden yesterday saying America's in a lot of trouble.
[02:20:20.554 --> 02:20:24.277]  We have Secretary of Defense Hagel saying the whole world's blowing up, close quote.
[02:20:24.557 --> 02:20:27.539]  Obama comes out and says that's the media making you think it's blowing up.
[02:20:28.079 --> 02:20:30.401]  Well, actually, they'll exaggerate things that aren't a big deal.
[02:20:31.482 --> 02:20:38.598]  Like gun deaths and then make just light of something huge like starting a war with Russia or ISIS running around.
[02:20:39.079 --> 02:20:40.483]  How would you quantify
[02:20:41.636 --> 02:20:45.279]  Working with the big think tanks and other groups that you work with, the state of the world right now.
[02:20:45.319 --> 02:20:54.186]  I had former top CIA analyst on Ray McGovern Friday, and he said the world is in a more dangerous situation now in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:20:54.986 --> 02:20:59.510]  And he basically said you cannot overplay how serious things are.
[02:20:59.770 --> 02:21:01.011]  What's your take on the state of the world?
[02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:04.991]  Yes, I think that it is a very serious situation.
[02:21:05.051 --> 02:21:07.932]  As you know, I've been pointing it out for some time.
[02:21:08.312 --> 02:21:16.795]  It's very dangerous for Washington and the Western media to continue to provoke Russia and China the way that they do.
[02:21:17.595 --> 02:21:19.496]  It's almost insane.
[02:21:20.517 --> 02:21:25.801]  Both of these countries are nuclear powers, and they're not threatening us.
[02:21:25.981 --> 02:21:27.182]  They're not threatening us.
[02:21:27.242 --> 02:21:28.743]  They're not threatening their neighbors.
[02:21:29.763 --> 02:21:36.288]  But when you tell China that the South China Sea is an area of American national interest,
[02:21:37.248 --> 02:21:57.255]  And you start building new naval and air bases from the Philippines to Vietnam to contain China, and you show Russia that you see them as an enemy that has to be defeated, and you're putting anti-ballistic missile bases on their borders, and you're causing them trouble in their backyard.
[02:21:57.835 --> 02:22:03.477]  You really are, and you have a nuclear doctrine of preemptive first strike.
[02:22:04.850 --> 02:22:08.012]  Then you tell those countries, my God, these people are crazy.
[02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:09.834]  What are we going to do?
[02:22:10.194 --> 02:22:15.538]  And so you can very easily end into a disastrous war.
[02:22:15.598 --> 02:22:27.407]  So I think that that is true, that Washington, fearful of losing its control over Europe, is pushing the world to the brink of war.
[02:22:27.827 --> 02:22:30.569]  As for the American economy, it really isn't one.
[02:22:31.210 --> 02:22:33.972]  It has never come out of the recession.
[02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:42.657]  In 2008, the Europeans are all in the same sort of situation we are, the British.
[02:22:43.898 --> 02:22:46.680]  There's nothing to drive these economies.
[02:22:47.981 --> 02:22:51.864]  The wealth and income is increasingly concentrated in a few hands.
[02:22:52.525 --> 02:22:55.007]  There are no jobs for university graduates.
[02:22:55.567 --> 02:22:58.390]  The rate of unemployment among the young is very high.
[02:23:00.798 --> 02:23:09.123]  The countries that are tied into the American payment system established after World War II, they're all suffering.
[02:23:09.143 --> 02:23:14.386]  They're all subject to being blackmailed and destabilized by Washington.
[02:23:14.967 --> 02:23:17.128]  And we're on the verge of big changes.
[02:23:17.348 --> 02:23:20.810]  I think you're going to see the end of the dollar payment system.
[02:23:21.231 --> 02:23:23.332]  This is now already in the works.
[02:23:23.832 --> 02:23:37.919]  This is going to further erode and seriously impede American influence and Washington's power and American living standards, which are already under pressure, and they're going to take a big jolt down.
[02:23:38.999 --> 02:23:41.122]  There's going to be more political instability.
[02:23:41.542 --> 02:23:49.792]  We now have essentially an armed police state, you know, homeland security, all these tanks and weapons and blah blah, and the police are militarized.
[02:23:50.373 --> 02:23:52.336]  So I think it's a very serious situation.
[02:23:52.416 --> 02:23:57.061]  It's probably as serious as the world has ever experienced.
[02:23:58.038 --> 02:24:10.503]  And it's a paradox because the political class, Rand Corporation and others, in documents I've read from the 80s, 90s, they foresaw all this, but then said it should be capitalized on and how the political elite could get even more power.
[02:24:11.770 --> 02:24:16.453]  out of their national stabilization force and out of establishing all this.
[02:24:17.093 --> 02:24:19.415]  But then if you really study it, it's delusional.
[02:24:19.775 --> 02:24:22.477]  They think they're in control, but they're not.
[02:24:22.537 --> 02:24:37.145]  And only fools, history has shown, would destroy a wealthy, powerful system and soft power that you've talked about to replace it with, you know, it reminds me of like the Argentinians in 1982 with the military dictator.
[02:24:37.626 --> 02:24:40.608]  So they start a war with the British and the Falklands arrogantly.
[02:24:42.869 --> 02:24:44.110]  It feels like that.
[02:24:44.130 --> 02:24:46.132]  It feels like desperation.
[02:24:46.472 --> 02:24:49.895]  And I'm starting to agree with you more that it is mental illness.
[02:24:50.135 --> 02:24:53.478]  That there really isn't even a real policy here.
[02:24:54.239 --> 02:24:59.623]  And then I look at the three women running the State Department that are red-faced warmongers.
[02:24:59.643 --> 02:25:01.825]  I mean, it really scares me.
[02:25:02.706 --> 02:25:06.229]  Yeah, you should be scared.
[02:25:06.329 --> 02:25:07.430]  There is a conspiracy.
[02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:08.631]  It's the neoconservative one.
[02:25:11.339 --> 02:25:17.720]  In fact, the neoconservative conspiracy is far more dangerous than the Rothschild conspiracy, or any of the others.
[02:25:18.667 --> 02:25:23.052]  And these people have this ideology of American supremacy.
[02:25:23.092 --> 02:25:24.893]  They're just essentially like Nazis.
[02:25:25.494 --> 02:25:26.475]  We are exceptional.
[02:25:26.515 --> 02:25:27.496]  We are indispensable.
[02:25:28.257 --> 02:25:32.801]  For those that don't know, Ray McGovern said the same thing when he was on Friday.
[02:25:33.142 --> 02:25:35.504]  People said, well boy, this is Obama, neolibs.
[02:25:35.844 --> 02:25:37.066]  How is it neoconservatives?
[02:25:37.126 --> 02:25:41.210]  Explain to people who's really running this administration's foreign policy.
[02:25:41.994 --> 02:25:47.016]  Well, the three women you mentioned in the State Department, they're all neoconservatives.
[02:25:47.656 --> 02:25:48.456]  That's well known.
[02:25:49.217 --> 02:25:50.497]  So is Samantha Powers.
[02:25:50.877 --> 02:25:53.538]  In fact, the whole government is.
[02:25:53.658 --> 02:25:55.699]  It has been since Clinton's second term.
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:06.883]  So they run the government, they run the State Department, they run the Defense Department, they run the National Security Council, they run security agencies.
[02:26:08.352 --> 02:26:11.333]  It doesn't mean that everybody in the CIA agrees with them.
[02:26:11.393 --> 02:26:11.733]  They don't.
[02:26:12.073 --> 02:26:13.913]  No, they hate them.
[02:26:14.493 --> 02:26:22.775]  They're in the positions of controlled spokesperson and policy implementation, and they're driving this to war.
[02:26:22.795 --> 02:26:24.756]  I mean, that's where we got the Middle Eastern wars.
[02:26:24.836 --> 02:26:26.016]  It came from these people.
[02:26:26.036 --> 02:26:27.396]  And that's where I wanted to go next.
[02:26:27.856 --> 02:26:29.877]  How do they have the border wide open
[02:26:30.877 --> 02:26:40.745]  And then, meanwhile, say an attack's imminent in El Paso at Fort Bliss with ISIS, which might actually happen, because I've got good sources down there saying it's crawling with them down there.
[02:26:41.586 --> 02:26:48.212]  And how does Obama and the neocons think they're going to get away with allowing an attack here when clearly they've opened the door?
[02:26:49.222 --> 02:26:52.445]  I don't think that ISIS is gonna attack us.
[02:26:53.386 --> 02:26:55.568]  If there's an attack, it'll be a false flag.
[02:26:55.649 --> 02:26:56.289]  Oh, probably, yeah.
[02:26:56.589 --> 02:26:58.031]  And they'll blame it on ISIS.
[02:26:58.071 --> 02:26:59.512]  That's where all this comes from.
[02:26:59.893 --> 02:27:03.476]  Look, ISIS has its hands full in Syria and Iraq.
[02:27:04.617 --> 02:27:05.918]  It's creating a new state.
[02:27:05.978 --> 02:27:10.180]  It's carving out a new country, partly from Iraq, partly from Syria.
[02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:13.641]  They don't have any time to go over here and fool around on the Mexican border.
[02:27:14.202 --> 02:27:18.604]  This is a total diversion from what they're trying to do.
[02:27:19.915 --> 02:27:28.604]  And so when you hear anybody telling you, oh, ISIS, it means it's going to be a false flag attack, and they've got somebody new to blame.
[02:27:28.644 --> 02:27:32.008]  They can't blame bin Laden anymore because they claim they killed him.
[02:27:33.189 --> 02:27:35.551]  Ten years after he died, they killed him.
[02:27:35.811 --> 02:27:38.554]  And so, and al-Qaeda has sort of disappeared.
[02:27:38.594 --> 02:27:39.395]  We now have ISIS.
[02:27:40.546 --> 02:28:05.851]  Well, I agree with you that a false flag is very probable, but ISIS itself being armed by the West is the false flag, and they have killed more journalists now, chopped another one's head off today, and they've said, we're going to attack the West if you don't keep bombing us, or if you don't stop bombing us, and up top they're being manipulated by different moles inside our agencies from my research.
[02:28:06.771 --> 02:28:07.232]  I don't know.
[02:28:07.312 --> 02:28:08.593]  I don't think so.
[02:28:08.673 --> 02:28:17.740]  I think that they're focused on the Middle East, and when they say they're going to attack the West, they're talking about Western interests in the Middle East.
[02:28:19.081 --> 02:28:27.348]  And they're not going to waste their time and energy to come over here and blow up a building or a shopping center or whatever they decide.
[02:28:27.408 --> 02:28:28.549]  It doesn't do them any good.
[02:28:28.569 --> 02:28:30.491]  DHS would do that to take our liberties.
[02:28:31.404 --> 02:28:33.206]  They would do that for that reason.
[02:28:34.406 --> 02:28:55.441]  I think right now the government in Washington, to the extent we have a government, is focused on Russia and they're trying to drive their puppets in Europe into confrontation with Russia because they want to break off the economic relationships between Europe and Russia, which threaten the American empire.
[02:28:55.481 --> 02:28:57.783]  What do you think Germany is going to do in the one minute we've got left?
[02:28:59.648 --> 02:29:00.388]  I think so.
[02:29:19.062 --> 02:29:22.564]  And Germany telling her, don't you be a fool, we don't want to do this.
[02:29:23.124 --> 02:29:32.208]  So it really depends whether Washington has her so much in their grip that she has to do what Washington says regardless of the opposition of her own people.
[02:29:32.228 --> 02:29:32.828]  We'll find out.
[02:29:32.868 --> 02:29:33.989]  They've been tapping their phones.
[02:29:35.014 --> 02:29:35.574]  We'll find out.
[02:30:08.672 --> 02:30:15.740]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:17.982]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:30:18.182 --> 02:30:23.268]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:30:23.468 --> 02:30:28.413]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:30:28.613 --> 02:30:31.676]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:30:31.936 --> 02:30:35.800]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:40.264]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:30:40.345 --> 02:30:50.354]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:30:50.574 --> 02:30:53.097]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:30:53.277 --> 02:31:01.344]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:31:01.484 --> 02:31:05.448]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:08.900 --> 02:31:14.867]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:31:15.067 --> 02:31:19.251]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:31:19.632 --> 02:31:24.197]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:31:24.597 --> 02:31:27.219]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:31:27.519 --> 02:31:32.723]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:31:32.964 --> 02:31:39.849]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:31:40.369 --> 02:31:44.112]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:31:44.492 --> 02:31:49.296]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:49.616 --> 02:31:50.457]  This is innovating.
[02:31:50.737 --> 02:31:58.047]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:31:58.227 --> 02:32:02.292]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:02.493 --> 02:32:07.659]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:32:08.692 --> 02:32:14.798]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forehood situation?
[02:32:14.818 --> 02:32:18.162]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:32:18.262 --> 02:32:19.843]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[02:32:19.904 --> 02:32:26.170]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:30.194]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security?
[02:32:30.274 --> 02:32:32.136]  Are we sticking our hands down on the streets?
[02:32:32.296 --> 02:32:36.061]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:32:36.261 --> 02:32:39.204]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:32:39.224 --> 02:32:47.374]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:32:47.614 --> 02:32:49.676]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:32:49.737 --> 02:32:50.758]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:32:51.118 --> 02:32:59.862]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[02:33:00.062 --> 02:33:02.524]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[02:33:37.521 --> 02:33:43.543]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:43.963 --> 02:33:46.363]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:46.864 --> 02:33:54.166]  All right, my friends.
[02:33:54.266 --> 02:33:56.326]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:33:56.346 --> 02:33:59.147]  I want to be clear, though.
[02:33:59.187 --> 02:34:03.708]  The reason you see so much corruption intensifying worldwide is a lot of reasons.
[02:34:04.569 --> 02:34:05.809]  But Hollywood's corruption
[02:34:09.049 --> 02:34:12.352]  Populations battling for scarce resources.
[02:34:13.713 --> 02:34:15.814]  That's part of the natural ebb and flow of society.
[02:34:15.834 --> 02:34:20.778]  It's just now we have nuclear weapons, biological weapons, drones, you name it.
[02:34:22.099 --> 02:34:32.346]  But the political elites are so removed from the battlefield, so removed from what they're politically doing, that that's a big part of why we see things getting so dangerous.
[02:34:33.867 --> 02:34:36.329]  I think about the neocon women that run the State Department.
[02:34:37.236 --> 02:34:38.336]  Samantha Powers and others.
[02:34:39.557 --> 02:34:47.778]  When they give speeches or briefings, if I saw someone at a restaurant who looked and acted like them, I would say that's a very dangerous mentally ill person.
[02:34:50.259 --> 02:34:58.441]  Hillary Clinton, if she was just a normal person with her statements and the way she acts and looks, I would say that's a neurotic, bad person on a power trip.
[02:34:58.501 --> 02:34:58.881]  Look out.
[02:35:02.406 --> 02:35:05.628]  And I always hear, oh, if women ran things, there'd be no war in the world.
[02:35:05.929 --> 02:35:07.530]  What a load of bull.
[02:35:08.250 --> 02:35:09.851]  It's not, I'm not attacking women right now.
[02:35:10.212 --> 02:35:16.816]  It's just that the whole gimmick of Hillary Clinton, I have been looking at her since 1992.
[02:35:17.557 --> 02:35:22.820]  22 years, since high school.
[02:35:26.063 --> 02:35:27.784]  When that whole presidential election was going on.
[02:35:27.844 --> 02:35:27.944]  I'm 40.
[02:35:29.565 --> 02:35:30.346]  I'm sick of her.
[02:35:32.113 --> 02:35:41.096]  And I'm gonna have to hear the gimmick of, oh, you're not for Hillary, you don't like women, and women's groups with their signs, I'm for Hillary, time for a woman to be in charge.
[02:35:41.316 --> 02:35:42.616]  She's been in charge!
[02:35:44.497 --> 02:35:56.100]  And if the Republican leadership has their way, they're gonna have some socialist, crumbum, neocon, fake, rhino run against her and hand it to her.
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:01.162]  And if this country doesn't get upset, and I don't mean the whole country,
[02:36:02.537 --> 02:36:09.093]  But the large minority of people, who are every race, color, and creed, who know what's going on, if we don't get upset and just start saying no...
[02:36:11.596 --> 02:36:13.057]  Then stick a fork in us, we're done.
[02:36:13.137 --> 02:36:20.543]  Because it's just getting worse, and worse, and worse, and crazier, and weirder, and stupider.
[02:36:20.884 --> 02:36:22.425]  They teach kids 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:36:22.505 --> 02:36:28.450]  When I first learned about that in Common Core like 3 or 4 years ago, I went, that's not true, that's a headline.
[02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:32.954]  And I went and looked it up and they had a real curriculum saying 2 plus 2 isn't always 4.
[02:36:33.694 --> 02:36:34.395]  It could be 3 or 5.
[02:36:35.416 --> 02:36:36.517]  It's all how you feel.
[02:36:38.015 --> 02:36:40.477]  And then Obama said, I didn't build my operation.
[02:36:40.938 --> 02:36:43.239]  And then increasing a debt doesn't increase a debt.
[02:36:43.279 --> 02:36:46.742]  I mean, it makes me so angry.
[02:36:46.762 --> 02:36:52.988]  The New York Times came out over the weekend, and Kurt Nemo wrote an article about it, endorsing the death panels.
[02:36:55.984 --> 02:37:00.165]  There were people commenting on my website going, well there are, you know, there's not enough money.
[02:37:00.705 --> 02:37:01.165]  Blah blah blah.
[02:37:01.425 --> 02:37:06.346]  If you didn't have government involved and it was free market and charities, the care would be competitive and super cheap.
[02:37:06.606 --> 02:37:09.807]  We had the best and cheapest healthcare in the world in 1950.
[02:37:09.867 --> 02:37:10.627]  Look up the numbers.
[02:37:10.967 --> 02:37:13.928]  Now we've got some of the most expensive screwed up healthcare!
[02:37:15.288 --> 02:37:20.189]  That's because government got involved, regulators got involved, and they screwed this country up!
[02:37:22.939 --> 02:37:41.113]  And I'm tired of sitting here in the country I love, watching it go to hell in a handbasket, while a bunch of foreign, offshore, globalist... I went into a jewelry store to get my daughters some little, you know, $50, $60 Tiffany silver necklaces.
[02:37:41.654 --> 02:37:43.335]  I've never got them anything like that.
[02:37:43.855 --> 02:37:47.778]  I bought them Tiffany rattles when they were babies, which they don't even make anymore.
[02:37:47.798 --> 02:37:49.760]  You know, those were like a hundred bucks or something.
[02:37:51.553 --> 02:37:55.934]  And so I went in, and I was in this place, and there was a picture of Warren Buffett.
[02:37:56.415 --> 02:37:58.095]  And I said, what's Warren Buffett have to do with this?
[02:37:58.115 --> 02:38:02.276]  They go, oh, Warren Buffett bought this family-owned jewelry chain.
[02:38:02.876 --> 02:38:07.558]  And I went in there because I knew it was a family-owned jewelry chain out of Seattle.
[02:38:09.198 --> 02:38:12.119]  And I still got the stuff and then left.
[02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:16.260]  I knew they carried some of that Tiffany stuff.
[02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:17.760]  I just go, it doesn't even matter.
[02:38:18.421 --> 02:38:19.441]  The point is, it's just like,
[02:38:21.502 --> 02:38:24.343]  One of my buddies lives in a building downtown and I looked at who owns it.
[02:38:24.363 --> 02:38:25.663]  It always looks, it's Warren Buffett.
[02:38:27.004 --> 02:38:33.326]  And then I was just thinking about how he's got all these banker bailouts, all these insider deals, and then he lobbies to raise taxes on poor people.
[02:38:33.566 --> 02:38:34.366]  Makes me want to throw up.
[02:38:34.406 --> 02:38:37.287]  I don't want to just get off on some Warren Buffett jag.
[02:38:38.228 --> 02:38:40.448]  But I was in a jewelry store and had to look at him.
[02:38:46.731 --> 02:38:50.532]  All because I wanted to give my daughter some jewelry and teach him how to take care of stuff.
[02:38:51.425 --> 02:38:52.745]  So they can wear it to church or whatever.
[02:38:52.765 --> 02:39:01.468]  I've got all these calls, all this important news.
[02:39:01.528 --> 02:39:09.030]  It's just... I am fundamentally being robbed and screwed over by people like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.
[02:39:09.350 --> 02:39:10.850]  I know what they've committed against me.
[02:39:11.010 --> 02:39:11.931]  I know who they are.
[02:39:12.231 --> 02:39:15.252]  I know how they're funding the whole gun control agenda, along with George Soros.
[02:39:15.612 --> 02:39:16.492]  I don't like them.
[02:39:19.909 --> 02:39:21.570]  Because they've dominated me!
[02:39:22.271 --> 02:39:24.333]  They're screwing over my country I love!
[02:39:25.113 --> 02:39:26.574]  Why don't you take it personal?
[02:39:26.594 --> 02:39:42.988]  I mean, I see guys... I was at the grocery store, and I was in line, and these two guys were arguing with each other about who was gonna win some Labor Day football game.
[02:39:44.397 --> 02:40:06.852]  They were getting aggressive with each other and showing off, and, oh yeah, well, they've got a deeper, you know, weapons arsenal, blah, blah, blah, on this side, and, oh yeah, well, they've got such, oh yeah, and it's like, men are supposed to be like that about, you know, over this hill is where the line of the such-and-such tribe is, and if you cross that, they will attack you for hunting in that area, but I believe that we should be able there, because my grandfather hunted in that area.
[02:40:07.372 --> 02:40:09.514]  You know, that's a 10,000-year-old worldview.
[02:40:10.274 --> 02:40:20.618]  Or a thousand years ago about, you know, we need to get together and form a military alliance with this tribe because we're going to be hit by the, and sacked by these vandals that, you know, hit us 20 years ago again.
[02:40:20.638 --> 02:40:23.299]  And they've been raiding up and down the coast.
[02:40:23.319 --> 02:40:32.102]  I mean, men are supposed to be knowing how things work, involved, serious, honorable, warriors at the same time.
[02:40:32.342 --> 02:40:36.184]  I just look at men and they're just laying out, acting cool.
[02:40:36.704 --> 02:40:38.345]  And they're so unmanly.
[02:40:39.219 --> 02:40:42.039]  Even if they're all roided out and acting tough with a shaved head.
[02:40:44.016 --> 02:40:46.616]  A man knows about geopolitical issues.
[02:40:46.737 --> 02:40:49.337]  A man knows about finances.
[02:40:49.517 --> 02:40:51.317]  A man knows how the world works.
[02:40:51.757 --> 02:40:53.218]  A man is involved.
[02:40:53.738 --> 02:40:57.999]  And it's because we are a dishonored society that isn't led by good men.
[02:40:58.299 --> 02:41:03.019]  We are led by the worst men and worst women out there imaginable.
[02:41:03.239 --> 02:41:11.381]  And we have accepted lie after lie after fraud after fraud until we don't even know who we are anymore!
[02:41:12.654 --> 02:41:22.639]  Let me tell you, it's a big deal to have that southern border open and to just be flooded with people with U-Hauls and trucks and buses just full.
[02:41:22.979 --> 02:41:32.904]  I mean, I'll pull into a Target or something and it's just, there'll be like three buses with just people pouring out with their bags, obvious refugees, like, whoa, what is going on?
[02:41:33.344 --> 02:41:41.629]  As the country collapses, as we go into depression, what is the government planning?
[02:41:42.608 --> 02:41:44.471]  And then I don't disagree with Roberts completely.
[02:41:44.591 --> 02:41:48.896]  I'm the guy that used to debate with him ten years ago about whether 9-11 was an inside job or not.
[02:41:49.237 --> 02:41:50.499]  He came around to the fact that it is.
[02:41:51.500 --> 02:41:55.205]  That's a guy that's in all these big, huge think tanks, Brookings, you name it.
[02:41:55.225 --> 02:41:57.348]  I mean, he's high level, folks.
[02:42:00.871 --> 02:42:06.474]  So when I get up here and I say, no, ISIS is real, ISIS is the most radical, dangerous people there are.
[02:42:06.754 --> 02:42:09.716]  They're allowed to go back and forth to England, back and forth to France.
[02:42:09.936 --> 02:42:12.417]  They're being left, they're allowed to operate on Twitter and Facebook.
[02:42:12.818 --> 02:42:16.760]  It's in the news again today, whereas they're always censoring my stuff.
[02:42:22.538 --> 02:42:27.139]  I happen to know that this terror threat is real from our military and border patrol sources.
[02:42:27.179 --> 02:42:27.960]  I can't say any more.
[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:30.820]  I don't want to get subpoenaed or get arrested, okay?
[02:42:31.841 --> 02:42:33.181]  Because this is national security stuff.
[02:42:33.201 --> 02:42:34.181]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:42:34.882 --> 02:42:37.883]  That they're being told, shut up, this stuff's being leaked.
[02:42:38.603 --> 02:42:40.963]  Do you think Obama wants people to know there's ISIS down on the border?
[02:42:42.264 --> 02:42:44.925]  No, they want him to let them hit us and then he'll just play dumb.
[02:42:45.285 --> 02:42:48.846]  And the media won't call him, he'll get away with it and take basic freedoms of Americans.
[02:42:49.286 --> 02:42:49.426]  No.
[02:42:51.431 --> 02:43:00.045]  The Al-Qaeda people are working with the drug cartels because it's very similar criminal culture operations.
[02:43:01.247 --> 02:43:04.852]  Strongman operations, whole nine yards, a lot of Saudi Arabian money.
[02:43:07.179 --> 02:43:11.322]  There is an islamicist move, a radical islamicist move worldwide right now.
[02:43:11.342 --> 02:43:12.823]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to your calls.
[02:43:12.883 --> 02:43:17.927]  Blake and Curtis and Danny and John in the UK and John in Florida.
[02:43:18.108 --> 02:43:18.948]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[02:43:18.968 --> 02:43:19.649]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:43:19.709 --> 02:43:21.930]  Blake, I held you over because Roberts came on.
[02:43:22.091 --> 02:43:31.118]  You were talking about doing deliveries to hotels all over Oklahoma and how they're just full of illegals waiting to try to find a house or whatever.
[02:43:32.372 --> 02:43:35.293]  Government and charities are putting them up in the hotels.
[02:43:35.613 --> 02:43:37.434]  You can go further and get that from the hotel staff.
[02:43:37.474 --> 02:43:38.174]  We've confirmed it.
[02:43:38.634 --> 02:43:46.337]  We were told by ICE and Border Patrol, come down here to McAllen, you will see us being forced to load them on buses and pay for their tickets and give them food.
[02:43:48.258 --> 02:43:54.220]  Remember, they want... See, Obama comes out and says, sorry, I can't do anything for you on immigration today.
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:55.961]  See the shill there?
[02:43:56.581 --> 02:43:58.662]  He's totally basically into deportations, 97%.
[02:43:58.702 --> 02:43:59.862]  They're letting felons go.
[02:44:02.128 --> 02:44:05.691]  They're busing the people in, but meanwhile, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!
[02:44:06.432 --> 02:44:08.734]  They've got illegals protesting the White House every day!
[02:44:08.814 --> 02:44:09.235]  Every day!
[02:44:09.495 --> 02:44:10.236]  They're allowed to!
[02:44:10.356 --> 02:44:10.796]  I'm not!
[02:44:10.856 --> 02:44:11.377]  I've been there!
[02:44:11.557 --> 02:44:12.318]  You've seen the video!
[02:44:12.598 --> 02:44:15.601]  The Secret Service has no cameras, no protesting, we'll arrest you!
[02:44:15.861 --> 02:44:21.947]  The illegals can march around all day, and they're all angry, HOW DARE YOU ONLY GIVE ME WELFARE AND FREE RIDES EVERYWHERE!
[02:44:22.127 --> 02:44:23.108]  THIS IS NOT ENOUGH!
[02:44:23.468 --> 02:44:24.830]  I WANT EVERYTHING NOW!
[02:44:26.803 --> 02:44:31.686]  Just marching around everywhere, and Obama, you see that cover?
[02:44:31.726 --> 02:44:33.046]  It's a full spectrum of lies.
[02:44:33.247 --> 02:44:38.529]  They create a whole paradigm of fraud, where you're just swimming in an ocean of lies.
[02:44:39.050 --> 02:44:48.455]  And so Obama had not enough for Latinos, as if that's what you, as if if you are Hispanic in any way, you're supposed to just want totally open borders when no one else does that in the world.
[02:44:49.540 --> 02:44:53.604]  And when it's collapsing countries, the depression is global, folks.
[02:44:54.024 --> 02:44:55.105]  The depression is here.
[02:44:55.325 --> 02:44:56.787]  It's worse than Latin America.
[02:44:57.708 --> 02:45:03.873]  And the message is being sent, come here, so the numbers are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[02:45:04.053 --> 02:45:12.922]  And when you lose your job or you're bankrupt, I want all of you to remember, when this country looks like Guatemala City, I want you to remember.
[02:45:13.931 --> 02:45:15.612]  It may feel good to be trendy.
[02:45:16.253 --> 02:45:17.834]  It may feel good to love Obama.
[02:45:17.854 --> 02:45:20.536]  The Lord and Savior, as Jamie Foxx calls him.
[02:45:22.337 --> 02:45:22.918]  But he's not.
[02:45:23.518 --> 02:45:24.579]  And it's part of a bigger plan.
[02:45:24.739 --> 02:45:25.820]  North American Union.
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:30.283]  The elite live in Luxembourg, Monte Carlo, Geneva, Switzerland.
[02:45:31.884 --> 02:45:33.165]  They live in Grand Cayman.
[02:45:33.826 --> 02:45:35.827]  They live in the Cook Islands.
[02:45:36.568 --> 02:45:39.410]  They do not live here.
[02:45:42.449 --> 02:45:46.832]  The idiot Hollywood people do, all that, it's all going to blow away, folks.
[02:45:46.872 --> 02:45:48.253]  It's all the end of a Ponzi scheme.
[02:45:48.553 --> 02:45:53.116]  And I think they're going to use the giant hordes of illegals as the cover for why we collapse or something.
[02:45:53.356 --> 02:45:56.978]  I mean, this is so diabolical, Legion of Doom level stuff, okay?
[02:45:57.218 --> 02:45:58.880]  And it's not going to help all these poor refugees.
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:01.521]  Blake, go ahead and tell folks what you saw.
[02:46:01.561 --> 02:46:02.062]  Thanks for holding.
[02:46:03.362 --> 02:46:11.808]  Well, I think the most important thing that each of us individually can do
[02:46:12.976 --> 02:46:19.417]  Is when something happens or before it happens, print off some documentation from your website.
[02:46:20.197 --> 02:46:23.598]  Go to your local news station.
[02:46:24.038 --> 02:46:29.219]  I know that they're all, you know, part of the dinosaur media, that there are still people that work in them that are local.
[02:46:29.779 --> 02:46:31.299]  They care about the local communities.
[02:46:31.919 --> 02:46:41.321]  If everybody just, you know, ignored the fact that it might be a little embarrassing because, you know, most of the trendy people, you know, say, oh, where's your tinfoil hat?
[02:46:42.455 --> 02:46:44.978]  Yeah, if you're like 2 plus 2 equals 4, they go, oh, 10-4!
[02:46:44.998 --> 02:46:48.821]  Hey, we ought to be involved and defend our liberties.
[02:46:49.082 --> 02:46:50.623]  Weirdo!
[02:46:50.863 --> 02:46:51.924]  Yeah, those people don't count.
[02:46:52.905 --> 02:47:00.233]  Some of them even still do that after you show them a video that proves something, like from your website.
[02:47:01.054 --> 02:47:04.317]  And I think one of the most important things to do is say,
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:08.163]  We have to turn around before the bottom drops out.
[02:47:08.463 --> 02:47:17.590]  We have to do something beforehand, because... Well, they've never been to the bottom falling out, so they think it's funny, like it's going to be some spectator event.
[02:47:17.630 --> 02:47:20.173]  Like, oh, there's going to be a depression and war in the streets?
[02:47:20.213 --> 02:47:21.374]  That'll be entertaining!
[02:47:21.714 --> 02:47:25.037]  Like when we blow up Iraq or something and both sides are dying?
[02:47:26.838 --> 02:47:39.023]  Again, I've been told by liquor store owners and pizza place owners that when they launch a new war, that's when record pizzas and wings and liquor sold and everybody just goes on, oh look at them buildings getting blown up.
[02:47:39.043 --> 02:47:47.827]  Well, let me tell you, when America collapses, all these yuppies that think everything's funny and wear their ignorance like a suit of armor, you're going to find out what it's like.
[02:47:47.847 --> 02:47:50.268]  I mean, I'll tell you, what they're going to do is they're going to politically
[02:47:51.249 --> 02:47:52.690]  Enslave all of us, the producers.
[02:47:53.211 --> 02:47:54.091]  It's not pretty, folks.
[02:47:54.172 --> 02:47:54.752]  It's not pretty.
[02:47:54.792 --> 02:47:55.673]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[02:47:56.073 --> 02:48:05.061]  I'm just, it's like, you pull through a green light, somebody runs it, and everything goes into slow motion as that truck comes in and hits your car and you see a piece of paper floating by.
[02:48:05.381 --> 02:48:06.702]  I've been in those car wrecks, folks.
[02:48:07.022 --> 02:48:11.966]  And I'm just, I'm telling people, hey, we pulled out the green light, a Mack truck's coming right at us.
[02:48:12.127 --> 02:48:13.268]  Uh-oh, we're getting T-boned.
[02:48:13.528 --> 02:48:15.870]  Get ready to, you know, get ready to have some broken ribs.
[02:48:17.551 --> 02:48:19.493]  That's all I'm doing is saying brace for impact.
[02:48:20.745 --> 02:48:24.188]  That's all I'm doing is saying, man, we got screwed over.
[02:48:25.769 --> 02:48:26.670]  That's all I can do.
[02:48:27.130 --> 02:48:28.911]  And their response is, tinfoil hat.
[02:48:28.971 --> 02:48:30.192]  Okay, tinfoil hat then!
[02:48:32.374 --> 02:48:34.516]  Because I know what's going on and it's all out in the open.
[02:48:34.776 --> 02:48:36.417]  That's what they give the unintellectual.
[02:48:36.517 --> 02:48:37.878]  Oh, that's not going on, honey.
[02:48:38.118 --> 02:48:40.180]  Two plus two equals five, like Obama said.
[02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:42.362]  Don't listen to that crazy man that says it's four.
[02:48:43.382 --> 02:48:43.943]  Thank you, Blake.
[02:48:44.463 --> 02:48:46.124]  Curtis in New Jersey, thanks for holding.
[02:48:49.047 --> 02:48:50.128]  Very interesting, Curtis.
[02:48:51.328 --> 02:48:52.448]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:48:52.468 --> 02:48:53.068]  Go ahead, Curtis.
[02:48:54.069 --> 02:48:54.669]  Hello, Alex.
[02:48:54.689 --> 02:48:55.209]  Hi.
[02:48:56.489 --> 02:48:59.910]  Yeah, I've been trying to reach Jesse Ventura since 2009.
[02:49:00.850 --> 02:49:03.531]  I found the answers to his 9-11 questions.
[02:49:04.231 --> 02:49:07.352]  I heard Jesse on YouTube and Fox and Friends and with Howard Stern.
[02:49:08.032 --> 02:49:13.954]  I have audio of Jesse queued up asking his three 9-11 questions less than 30 seconds.
[02:49:14.494 --> 02:49:14.894]  Here goes.
[02:49:17.912 --> 02:49:19.272]  So what are your questions?
[02:49:19.393 --> 02:49:20.673]  My questions are simple.
[02:49:20.853 --> 02:49:22.133]  I work in demolition.
[02:49:22.494 --> 02:49:25.014]  I'm a former frog in an underwater demolition team.
[02:49:25.114 --> 02:49:26.475]  I know how to blow things up.
[02:49:27.455 --> 02:49:29.856]  How could the buildings fall at the rate of gravity?
[02:49:30.336 --> 02:49:34.658]  Basic physics tells you that that can't happen.
[02:49:35.078 --> 02:49:38.259]  And how did the cement get so pulverized?
[02:49:39.139 --> 02:49:42.020]  Just simply from falling, it was blown into dust.
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:46.422]  What energy was required to pulverize all that cement?
[02:49:46.442 --> 02:49:47.242]  Oh my gosh!
[02:49:48.598 --> 02:49:52.521]  Alex, I need to show you what I found in two old newspapers.
[02:49:52.582 --> 02:49:55.083]  They're part of what I call Three Tips of the Iceberg.
[02:49:55.844 --> 02:49:57.805]  And this third part is a doctor's chart.
[02:49:57.866 --> 02:50:00.107]  They all match, telling the same story.
[02:50:00.688 --> 02:50:03.029]  They answer Jesse's questions.
[02:50:04.230 --> 02:50:04.631]  Are you there?
[02:50:04.651 --> 02:50:07.053]  Of course, I'm on the air, listening to you.
[02:50:07.073 --> 02:50:08.394]  Okay, okay, great.
[02:50:09.134 --> 02:50:10.575]  I'd like you to hear 35 words off the air.
[02:50:12.011 --> 02:50:17.576]  From the oldest newspaper, I can send... Sir, I don't have time for riddles, just do me a favor.
[02:50:18.136 --> 02:50:21.259]  Write an article about it in an email, send it to us, or do a video or something.
[02:50:21.819 --> 02:50:26.283]  Uh, those are more rhetorical, in return I ask them, how do buildings fall at free fall?
[02:50:26.663 --> 02:50:28.044]  How does it get pulverized dust?
[02:50:28.124 --> 02:50:29.345]  It's high power explosives.
[02:50:29.926 --> 02:50:34.349]  They had all three buildings wired up, like they were gonna blow up a mountain or something.
[02:50:34.730 --> 02:50:35.470]  Now, who did it?
[02:50:35.550 --> 02:50:36.291]  We're not sure.
[02:50:36.791 --> 02:50:38.573]  We just know the official story of 9-11 is not true.
[02:50:41.038 --> 02:50:44.420]  And look at our government giving stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:49.203]  Again... What's the riddle of the Sphinx?
[02:50:50.604 --> 02:50:50.904]  Tell me.
[02:50:50.924 --> 02:50:52.946]  They came down with explosives.
[02:50:52.986 --> 02:50:54.707]  You'd hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:50:55.007 --> 02:50:55.347]  We did?
[02:50:55.367 --> 02:50:56.608]  They came down in a roar.
[02:50:57.969 --> 02:50:58.669]  So what was it?
[02:51:00.190 --> 02:51:01.671]  Well, the atoms separated.
[02:51:03.152 --> 02:51:07.495]  Oh, you think they were using some type of high-tech beam or something?
[02:51:08.717 --> 02:51:14.820]  This is an announcement for all people who want to take a risk-free challenge to whiten their teeth in 5 minutes.

[02:51:34.231 --> 02:51:39.074]  Because the Power Swabs 5 Minute Challenge is exclusive, it's not available in drugstores.
[02:51:39.274 --> 02:51:45.397]  Power Swabs was formulated by Dr. Martin Ginegar and whitens teeth with a patented tooth detergent and whitening agent.

[02:51:51.601 --> 02:51:51.901]  Dial 1-800-281-6805.

[02:52:02.054 --> 02:52:02.254]  That's 1-800-281-6805.
[02:52:08.656 --> 02:52:10.478]  The human body is extraordinary.
[02:52:10.778 --> 02:52:14.761]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.

[02:53:08.007 --> 02:53:10.569]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:53:10.829 --> 02:53:15.692]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:53:15.952 --> 02:53:23.837]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:53:24.078 --> 02:53:28.380]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:32.403]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:53:32.563 --> 02:53:38.265]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:53:38.505 --> 02:53:41.286]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:53:41.666 --> 02:53:46.887]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:53:47.027 --> 02:53:55.170]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:53:55.210 --> 02:53:55.490]  That's 866-229-0927.
[02:53:55.530 --> 02:53:56.010]  Do business
[02:54:02.452 --> 02:54:02.934]  We're good to go.
[02:54:14.076 --> 02:54:17.098]  I want to go to John in the UK, then Danny, and John, and others.
[02:54:17.198 --> 02:54:20.240]  First, I never even got to this on the show today.
[02:54:42.068 --> 02:54:51.293]  Huge revelation, official Army admission, but really passe here for our audience because we've covered it so much.
[02:54:52.174 --> 02:54:52.514]  U.S.
[02:54:52.694 --> 02:54:58.057]  Army plans to battle anti-government dissidents in megacities, close quote.
[02:54:58.477 --> 02:55:04.381]  Future operations will neutralize groups
[02:55:05.973 --> 02:55:08.014]  Which undermine the authority of the state.
[02:55:08.134 --> 02:55:11.455]  So see, criticizing the state is bad.
[02:55:11.495 --> 02:55:15.196]  They will neutralize it, including using propaganda, but also physically.
[02:55:17.257 --> 02:55:25.540]  And this is a new article where the Army itself, in ArmyTimes.com, details the Army's capabilities at its integration center.
[02:55:27.401 --> 02:55:29.982]  And it's for use overseas, but also domestically.
[02:55:32.023 --> 02:55:38.805]  The reason the Army is so awake now and listens to this show is they heard me say this was coming forever, because I knew it was going on in more compartmentalized groups.
[02:55:39.225 --> 02:55:46.287]  Now that it's going to full-bore training, and they're bad-mouthing George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, gun owners, rural communities.
[02:55:47.687 --> 02:55:51.148]  The training is so over-the-top evil that it's just totally waking the military up.
[02:55:53.168 --> 02:56:02.652]  But they don't care, then they just move those people to foreign combat operations, or downsize them, and then use the people that go along with it to become the new domestic stability force.
[02:56:05.093 --> 02:56:09.415]  Which are just crazy, political, dangerous, authoritarian nuts.
[02:56:11.281 --> 02:56:13.842]  Believe me, you don't want to be a soldier in the Civil War.
[02:56:13.902 --> 02:56:16.462]  That's like wanting to play in traffic.
[02:56:17.383 --> 02:56:18.703]  And I don't want to fight with you either.
[02:56:19.243 --> 02:56:20.163]  I just think you're idiots.
[02:56:20.964 --> 02:56:27.025]  I mean, anybody that goes along with this just... I just can't believe how dishonorable you are.
[02:56:27.605 --> 02:56:29.686]  The good news is the military's not going along with it.
[02:56:29.706 --> 02:56:30.686]  See, that's what I mean.
[02:56:30.706 --> 02:56:33.727]  There's a real disconnect here with the political elite now.
[02:56:33.787 --> 02:56:36.728]  Stuff isn't even making sense anymore from their perspective.
[02:56:36.748 --> 02:56:40.049]  Because I can war game their plan, what they're doing, and it's just...
[02:56:41.693 --> 02:56:45.535]  Congress has a 7% approval rating on average, some of them as low as 6.
[02:56:47.416 --> 02:56:49.217]  The government's basically already fallen.
[02:56:49.457 --> 02:56:54.939]  That's why Dr. Paul Kirk Roberts said our government doesn't really function anymore.
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:56:57.040]  It doesn't.
[02:56:58.661 --> 02:57:01.722]  It's just like the Soviet Union or something.
[02:57:01.783 --> 02:57:08.626]  It's just a bunch of crazy kleptocrats and the only ideology they've got is like a weird leftist
[02:57:09.702 --> 02:57:17.467]  Hatred, but it's not even leftist, it's like this weird anti-human, control freak, anti-family, hatred of America thing.
[02:57:17.867 --> 02:57:23.710]  I just, it's really despicable that this level of scum runs things.
[02:57:24.291 --> 02:57:27.012]  Let's talk to John in the UK, then we'll go to Overdrive and go to Danny.
[02:57:27.352 --> 02:57:31.755]  John in the UK, what's your take on Obama meeting with NATO about Russia right now?
[02:57:32.135 --> 02:57:33.156]  Isn't that just special?
[02:57:34.378 --> 02:57:41.643]  In fact, I don't know if you're aware, but I'm actually about 1,500 meters away from HMS Duncan, which they just brought in eight hours ago.
[02:57:41.663 --> 02:57:48.427]  I'm in Cardiff right now, and your president, well, your alleged president, is flying in tomorrow.
[02:57:50.209 --> 02:57:51.369]  I know you called in about that.
[02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:53.471]  What's your take on the whole Russia situation?
[02:57:54.639 --> 02:57:59.441]  Well, actually, there's quite a lot of ground I'd like to cover, so I'd be very grateful if you'd try to bear with me.
[02:58:00.021 --> 02:58:14.346]  What I'm very concerned about, having walked around Cardiff and had a look at some of the security measures that they seem to be taking, is that they are actually genuinely serious about the prospect of a terrorist attack here in Cardiff.
[02:58:14.646 --> 02:58:21.089]  And I wouldn't be remotely surprised if there were some kind of attack on this coming Thursday morning.
[02:58:22.109 --> 02:58:23.690]  Now, my concern is
[02:58:24.350 --> 02:58:39.496]  That if there is a terrorist attack, it's going to be used as a diversion to disguise the real agenda that they have, which is to essentially conclude their preparations for war with Russia.
[02:58:39.936 --> 02:58:41.476]  And what I mean by that is... Stay there!
[02:58:41.516 --> 02:58:42.217]  This is vital!
[02:58:42.637 --> 02:58:44.017]  I'm going to come right back to you, sir.
[02:58:44.077 --> 02:58:44.938]  We're in overdrive.
[02:58:44.978 --> 02:58:45.418]  Stay there.
[02:58:45.758 --> 02:58:49.839]  Infowars.com forward slash show with a free video, feeds and more of your station.
[02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:56.282]  If not, stay tuned for more powerful transmissions across the country on this same station.
[02:58:58.964 --> 02:59:04.906]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:59:05.107 --> 02:59:09.269]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:59:09.669 --> 02:59:14.231]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:59:14.651 --> 02:59:17.253]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:59:17.573 --> 02:59:22.756]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:59:23.017 --> 02:59:29.901]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:59:30.401 --> 02:59:34.164]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:59:34.544 --> 02:59:39.327]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:39.647 --> 02:59:40.508]  This is innovating.
[02:59:40.788 --> 02:59:48.090]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:59:48.110 --> 02:59:51.992]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[03:00:03.076 --> 03:00:06.297]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.605 --> 03:00:15.225]  Big Brother.
[03:00:15.905 --> 03:00:16.945]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:17.666 --> 03:00:18.766]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:19.466 --> 03:00:20.226]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.006 --> 03:00:21.947]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.567 --> 03:00:26.187]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.748 --> 03:00:30.848]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.269 --> 03:00:37.610]  I ask that reporting is the richest terrorist group in history.
[03:00:37.970 --> 03:00:39.510]  Tens of billions of dollars.
[03:00:40.650 --> 03:00:43.131]  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, you name it, funding them.
[03:00:44.659 --> 03:00:47.882]  Western allies would not be doing that if it wasn't part of a larger plan.
[03:00:49.003 --> 03:00:55.991]  And again, some of these terror attacks, because IS is real terrorist group, they're just being turned loose like piranhas in your pool.
[03:00:58.129 --> 03:00:58.769]  I agree.
[03:00:59.350 --> 03:01:01.251]  I'm not there, but I've seen the preparations.
[03:01:01.771 --> 03:01:06.734]  I've talked to military sources I've got, and they say, no, we've heard all the fake terror alerts.
[03:01:07.454 --> 03:01:09.375]  And those same sources have told me when they're fake.
[03:01:09.956 --> 03:01:15.979]  They're saying by this September 11th, they are expecting terror attacks in Europe, the UK, and the United States.
[03:01:16.239 --> 03:01:17.180]  Now, that may not happen.
[03:01:18.083 --> 03:01:24.974]  But the word is we're basically standing down for something because it can all be a diversion from what's happening in Russia.
[03:01:25.014 --> 03:01:27.618]  So that really clicks what John in the UK was saying.
[03:01:27.658 --> 03:01:28.459]  Please continue, John.
[03:01:29.744 --> 03:01:30.305]  Yeah, thank you.
[03:01:30.325 --> 03:01:41.995]  I was trying to explain what I meant when I said that I think that a terrorist attack here could function as a diversion to disguise the real agenda.
[03:01:43.417 --> 03:01:54.407]  What I'm concerned will happen is that if there is a terrorist attack here, and I would remind you that Riyadh Khan is from Cardiff and there are known cells that function from Cardiff,
[03:01:55.968 --> 03:02:04.218]  If there is a terrorist attack here, that will be an ideal pretext for the government to say, oh dear, look, we need to be very careful about the flow of funds.
[03:02:05.099 --> 03:02:11.287]  We need to implement much more stringent measures with respect to movement of funds within the country.
[03:02:11.787 --> 03:02:36.216]  Now, I think you're aware that we owe something like 500% of our GDP here in the UK at the moment, and when you factor in our future obligations in terms of Social Security and pensions, it's something like 900%, which is pretty much what it was when they were decorating their walls with banknotes in Germany in the 1940s.
[03:02:40.916 --> 03:02:45.522]  Just to give you a little bit of background without wasting your time, I work abroad.
[03:02:45.582 --> 03:02:47.485]  I'm only currently in the UK.
[03:02:47.525 --> 03:02:55.456]  I've got a flat here in the Bay, which is one of the five locations locally that they're hosting these meetings with these 60 world leaders.
[03:02:57.297 --> 03:02:58.398]  I work abroad.
[03:02:58.799 --> 03:03:01.121]  I have a number of foreign businesses.
[03:03:01.742 --> 03:03:07.767]  And within the last year, or let me say 18 months, I've had two of my accounts frozen.
[03:03:08.248 --> 03:03:12.151]  And it's not just Lagarde, you know, what's her name?
[03:03:12.291 --> 03:03:13.152]  IMF head.
[03:03:13.593 --> 03:03:14.273]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:03:14.794 --> 03:03:15.975]  It's also your people.
[03:03:18.177 --> 03:03:32.437]  You may have an account, you're operating a legitimate business, trying to fund your workers, just doing normal everyday stuff, nothing exciting, and then you get an accusation from the Treasury that your bank may be supporting Hezbollah or something.
[03:03:32.997 --> 03:03:36.639]  Meanwhile, the government is protecting them, supporting them, letting them back in.
[03:03:36.939 --> 03:03:38.399]  They use the threat in general.
[03:03:38.459 --> 03:03:49.444]  Yes, all over the Western world, they're now training us for internal currency controls, capital controls, getting us ready for bail-ins, training us that our money isn't our money.
[03:03:50.700 --> 03:03:57.046]  Yeah, I don't know if you've read the report Taxing Times on the IMF website sometime in the middle of last year.
[03:03:57.066 --> 03:03:57.906]  No, I haven't.
[03:03:58.387 --> 03:04:06.034]  Okay, well, Christine Lagarde was advocating the idea that they should just siphon off 10%.
[03:04:06.474 --> 03:04:09.957]  Oh yes, I did see the derivative news articles off that report.
[03:04:09.997 --> 03:04:10.758]  Yes, I did see that.
[03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:12.340]  OK.
[03:04:12.861 --> 03:04:31.298]  Personally, I think when you look at it, when you look at, say, the UK debt, and the UK is a very significant economy within the context of what's going on in the European Union at the moment, if there's an increase in interest rates, 10% is not going to be anything like ambitious enough for Lagarde
[03:04:32.109 --> 03:04:38.954]  People working with her so I think they actually need some kind of a crisis which is going to be able to justify Yes, sir.
[03:04:38.974 --> 03:04:39.814]  I actually stay there.
[03:04:39.834 --> 03:04:56.565]  I'm gonna come back to you can pull up the article from last year They want a Marshall plan around a military conflict That's large enough to take the bankruptcy of Europe in the EU Into a global super state and the detonator is Ukraine, which is what you're saying.
[03:04:56.626 --> 03:04:59.768]  I want to line it up for Russia I want to get your final take on that John.
[03:04:59.788 --> 03:05:01.589]  We're going into more overdrive Danny
[03:05:02.350 --> 03:05:07.817]  And then Jack and John and film from Nova Scotia and we're done.
[03:05:09.585 --> 03:05:15.350]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.

[03:06:07.704 --> 03:06:08.505]  Effective.
[03:06:09.185 --> 03:06:09.786]  I didn't believe it.
[03:06:09.926 --> 03:06:14.248]  Neither did I. No way could you professionally remove unwanted hair pain-free and at home.
[03:06:14.408 --> 03:06:15.569]  My thoughts exactly.
[03:06:15.629 --> 03:06:18.611]  Remove my face and body hair without expensive painful office visits?
[03:06:18.751 --> 03:06:19.371]  Not possible.
[03:06:19.551 --> 03:06:20.652]  Great minds think alike.
[03:06:20.832 --> 03:06:22.153]  Until I tried No-No Pro.
[03:06:22.173 --> 03:06:22.593]  Mm-hmm.
[03:06:22.873 --> 03:06:24.014]  Wait, you tried No-No?
[03:06:24.134 --> 03:06:25.575]  Yes, and it works.
[03:06:25.855 --> 03:06:27.856]  I use it on my face, legs, bikini line.
[03:06:27.896 --> 03:06:30.178]  We're BFFs and you didn't tell me about No-No?
[03:06:30.238 --> 03:06:30.398]  Here.
[03:06:30.558 --> 03:06:31.839]  This is my new No-No Pro.
[03:06:31.939 --> 03:06:33.160]  The most powerful No-No made.
[03:06:33.340 --> 03:06:35.342]  Custom treatment levels, less hair in less time.
[03:06:35.522 --> 03:06:36.764]  Perfect for any skin type.
[03:06:36.924 --> 03:06:37.244]  Try it.
[03:06:37.404 --> 03:06:37.824]  No hair?
[03:06:37.925 --> 03:06:38.345]  No pain?
[03:06:38.525 --> 03:06:40.407]  No time-consuming expensive office visits?
[03:06:40.627 --> 03:06:40.827]  No.
[03:06:41.127 --> 03:06:41.348]  No.
[03:06:41.628 --> 03:06:42.389]  And no-no.
[03:06:42.609 --> 03:06:45.031]  For a limited time, you can try No-No Pro risk-free.
[03:06:45.051 --> 03:06:47.093]  You'll also get the facial kit and a travel case.

[03:06:49.034 --> 03:06:49.375]  That's it.
[03:06:49.455 --> 03:06:50.316]  I'm getting a no now.
[03:06:50.516 --> 03:06:51.777]  Great minds do think alike.
[03:06:52.947 --> 03:06:55.389]  Try Nono Pro risk-free by calling 800-952-5760.
[03:06:55.409 --> 03:06:55.449]  800-952-5760.
[03:06:55.509 --> 03:06:55.689]  That's 800-952-5760.
[03:06:55.709 --> 03:06:55.749]  800-952-5760.
[03:07:08.649 --> 03:07:15.771]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[03:07:15.871 --> 03:07:18.032]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[03:07:18.212 --> 03:07:23.374]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[03:07:23.534 --> 03:07:28.616]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[03:07:28.716 --> 03:07:31.817]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[03:07:32.117 --> 03:07:35.979]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[03:07:36.199 --> 03:07:40.481]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[03:07:40.561 --> 03:07:50.646]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[03:07:50.867 --> 03:07:55.189]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[03:07:55.309 --> 03:08:01.692]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[03:08:01.852 --> 03:08:05.878]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:08:05.898 --> 03:08:06.319]  Fix bayonets!
[03:08:19.881 --> 03:08:20.803]  Fix bayonets.
[03:08:21.404 --> 03:08:23.306]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:08:23.787 --> 03:08:28.414]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:08:28.975 --> 03:08:32.641]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:34.279 --> 03:08:37.381]  As threat of nuclear war grows, public attention turns to Justin Bieber.
[03:08:37.941 --> 03:08:42.584]  Public's preoccupation with Bieber's personal live highlights decline in Western society.
[03:08:42.604 --> 03:08:46.946]  Yeah, it's one of the top search terms instead of nuclear war, stuff like that.
[03:08:47.387 --> 03:08:49.968]  We're finishing up with John in the UK, a very interesting caller.
[03:08:50.408 --> 03:08:57.973]  He's a multinational businessman getting his bank accounts paying employees messed with constantly by the UK and the US.
[03:08:59.417 --> 03:09:05.799]  What's happening is medium-sized and small-time international business people are being harassed.
[03:09:05.839 --> 03:09:07.179]  Everything's being shut down.
[03:09:07.479 --> 03:09:11.300]  You're not allowed to legally take some money and put it in the Bahamas or put it in Switzerland.
[03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:13.161]  That's after-tax.
[03:09:13.201 --> 03:09:14.521]  They come and steal that from you.
[03:09:14.881 --> 03:09:18.122]  They just upped it sevenfold, I think, or is it sixfold?
[03:09:18.162 --> 03:09:19.303]  I saw the headline Sunday.
[03:09:20.723 --> 03:09:22.183]  The cost to get rid of your U.S.
[03:09:22.223 --> 03:09:22.803]  citizenship.
[03:09:23.784 --> 03:09:27.925]  When I was flying out to Las Vegas a few years ago to be interviewed by Jesse Ventura for his TV show,
[03:09:29.580 --> 03:09:32.921]  I saw them ripping through some guy's deal and he had six silver coins.
[03:09:34.821 --> 03:09:36.022]  And they were like, what are these?
[03:09:36.762 --> 03:09:38.162]  And he was a computer programmer.
[03:09:38.182 --> 03:09:39.963]  He'd flown on the same flight with me to Vegas.
[03:09:40.323 --> 03:09:40.923]  He was a listener.
[03:09:41.163 --> 03:09:43.164]  He goes, oh Alex Jones, I'll tell you when I'm done.
[03:09:43.604 --> 03:09:44.984]  So he comes over and talks to me.
[03:09:45.004 --> 03:09:46.265]  And I did an interview, put it out.
[03:09:48.525 --> 03:09:53.487]  And they were trying to take his five silver coins that he just took with him.
[03:09:53.947 --> 03:09:54.747]  And he was going to
[03:09:56.311 --> 03:10:04.098]  Go do some computer business for three days, but while he was there he was going to go to a coin convention and just see what he could sell the coins for.
[03:10:04.138 --> 03:10:05.079]  They weren't worth that much.
[03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:06.901]  They weren't even really collectibles.
[03:10:07.441 --> 03:10:09.383]  He just thought it was crazy they almost took them.
[03:10:09.783 --> 03:10:10.824]  That's what this is all about.
[03:10:11.385 --> 03:10:13.747]  You can get into the country, they just don't want you to get out.
[03:10:14.087 --> 03:10:16.129]  That's what Ron Paul said about seven years ago.
[03:10:16.510 --> 03:10:18.952]  This border fence isn't for the illegals, it's for us.
[03:10:20.013 --> 03:10:21.935]  And that's really what it is.
[03:10:23.010 --> 03:10:25.373]  So, finish up your point there, John, in the UK.
[03:10:25.513 --> 03:10:33.563]  NATO meetings, you're there in Cardiff where this is all going on, and His Lordship, His Excellency Barack Obama will be arriving tomorrow.
[03:10:34.656 --> 03:10:38.978]  But Alex, please allow me to jump straight to the main reason for this call and I'll be extremely brief.
[03:10:40.158 --> 03:10:48.981]  I concluded a while ago that if we don't counter-attack, if we don't do something about this, eventually we're going to get totally done over and we're going to lose the opportunity to act.
[03:10:49.882 --> 03:10:52.703]  And so I started working on a project a couple of years ago.
[03:10:52.963 --> 03:10:56.484]  I should let you know that actually I've subscribed to your channel for 10 years.
[03:10:56.524 --> 03:10:57.984]  I've been a listener to you for 10 years.
[03:10:58.044 --> 03:10:59.285]  Wow, thanks for putting up with me.
[03:11:01.106 --> 03:11:02.308]  Thank you very much indeed.
[03:11:02.388 --> 03:11:06.493]  In fact, a lot of your perspectives have actually informed my investment strategy.
[03:11:10.063 --> 03:11:20.572]  So, very often people call into your show and they say, oh dear, Alex, look what just happened to me, people are stealing my children, you know, TSA is trying to kind of rape me in the open and all this kind of thing.
[03:11:21.413 --> 03:11:25.556]  And you say to them, yeah, send us an email, there's not really much more you can do.
[03:11:25.996 --> 03:11:36.085]  And it occurred to me that the only way that we can actually kind of gain kind of tactical domination of the info war is if we have a central portal
[03:11:36.525 --> 03:11:36.826]  I don't know.
[03:11:52.005 --> 03:11:52.925]  Oh, come on.
[03:11:52.945 --> 03:11:53.846]  You're not a junior warrior.
[03:12:20.054 --> 03:12:21.075]  No, I'm serious.
[03:12:21.115 --> 03:12:21.555]  I really am.
[03:12:22.336 --> 03:12:37.229]  And what this then means is that if, for example, you're badly treated at a checkpoint or something like that, you just get out your camera, take a YouTube video or whatever, log straight into the site and upload it with the location data as well.
[03:12:37.249 --> 03:12:38.871]  So it's like a People's Leaks.
[03:12:39.271 --> 03:12:43.515]  It's a News Leaks where we're constantly leaking reality.
[03:12:44.965 --> 03:12:45.646]  Yes, exactly.
[03:12:45.906 --> 03:12:48.227]  And it's also kind of geo-located.
[03:12:48.587 --> 03:12:58.031]  So if there's trouble going down and somebody wants support or you see a story close to where you are, you can navigate there and you can go and help and you can capture... Sounds like a genius idea.
[03:12:58.051 --> 03:12:58.712]  Let me ask you this.
[03:12:59.152 --> 03:12:59.972]  What is the URL?
[03:12:59.992 --> 03:13:02.793]  Because my cousin Buckley was saying this guy sounds like an interesting fellow.
[03:13:02.813 --> 03:13:04.714]  You ought to find out who he is and have him on as a guest.
[03:13:05.074 --> 03:13:07.896]  Tell us, I mean, are you ready to tell folks about what you've created?
[03:13:09.291 --> 03:13:10.192]  Yes, yes I am.
[03:13:11.272 --> 03:13:18.096]  The website is myreports.com, but it's spelt with an I and a Z, as you Americans say.
[03:13:18.457 --> 03:13:22.419]  So that's like M-I-R-E-P-O-R-T-Z dot com.
[03:13:24.380 --> 03:13:29.202]  Well, very interesting, and we'll check that out, maybe get you on as a guest, because that's a great idea.
[03:13:29.222 --> 03:13:38.866]  I hope the site gets a lot of traffic so we can beta test it, but it's mi, colon, reports with a Z, and what's the actual URL again?
[03:13:39.938 --> 03:13:46.444]  Yeah, just www.mireportz.com.
[03:13:46.524 --> 03:13:48.826]  So forget about the colon, that's a distraction.
[03:13:52.049 --> 03:14:03.460]  We've got a series but we don't advertise anything else because I've got a kind of ongoing agenda to work against the interests of large corporations because everywhere I go
[03:14:04.280 --> 03:14:10.846]  Sure, because the big corporations get the laws written worldwide to shut you down.
[03:14:11.167 --> 03:14:16.531]  It's not that we're against a Walmart because they're just Walmart and successful, it's that they literally run
[03:14:17.517 --> 03:14:19.099]  We're good to go.
[03:14:34.904 --> 03:14:35.245]  Hey, buddy!
[03:14:54.810 --> 03:14:56.711]  Hey, uh, Alex, I was calling you.
[03:14:56.731 --> 03:14:58.672]  I wasn't really wanting to talk about politics.
[03:14:58.852 --> 03:14:59.113]  Yes, sir.
[03:14:59.273 --> 03:15:11.340]  But I was wanting you to give a testimony to everyone out there about, like, our ancestors, like, the Scottish and the Irish and the Saxons, and then, like, our aboriginal, like, you talk about your aboriginal ancestors, the Native Americans.
[03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:16.743]  Can you give a testimony to everyone about, like, how that awakened the DNA and how that feels?
[03:15:16.803 --> 03:15:18.184]  Can you give a quick testimony?
[03:15:18.284 --> 03:15:19.265]  Then I got two points to make.
[03:15:21.906 --> 03:15:22.226]  Well, uh,
[03:15:23.786 --> 03:15:33.035]  I just saw a scientific report out over the weekend where they've again scientifically proven brain-to-brain communication, basically ESP, it's like your brain is broadcasting.
[03:15:33.256 --> 03:15:43.386]  There's a lot of things we don't understand but that all the ancients were aware of, but again we don't know exactly how it works, but they've now scientifically proven that
[03:15:45.424 --> 03:15:50.826]  It would take hours to get into it, but I promise you, I want to do a special report on epigenetics.
[03:15:51.486 --> 03:15:56.627]  I'm going to get more scientists on on the subject, but long story short, it's not just in mammals.
[03:15:57.007 --> 03:16:06.570]  They can take chickens and raise them for 10 generations inside of a room that doesn't have trees, doesn't have images, anything in it, and then they can start
[03:16:07.731 --> 03:16:16.415]  projecting on the ceiling circles and things going by and they don't care but you have a hawk flyover, they all squawk and scream and run and hide the chicken coop.
[03:16:18.496 --> 03:16:37.045]  It is not learned, it is an instinct and it goes way beyond that and so when you start fighting for liberty, fighting for freedom, fighting for survival, that's why they say humans get better under stress, it then activates all of these instincts that go beyond instincts and are just like compressed data
[03:16:38.772 --> 03:16:54.857]  With digital information, we have compressed racial memory in there that has been passed on through the DNA, through the mitochondrial DNA, through all of it, and the question is how complex is it?
[03:16:56.057 --> 03:16:57.357]  Or how detailed is it?
[03:17:01.243 --> 03:17:03.984]  That's why they have ritual, that's why they have rites of passage.
[03:17:04.345 --> 03:17:15.250]  The system is aware of this and uses the knowledge to program what traits they want in the ancestral memories, which areas they want to unlock versus areas they want to keep dormant.
[03:17:15.791 --> 03:17:21.474]  And so they're activating our worst aspects to control us while trying to shutter our best aspects.
[03:17:22.580 --> 03:17:31.003]  And they found in times of prayer, in times of meditation, that the brainwaves raise to a higher level, and it begins unlocking a lot of that.
[03:17:31.023 --> 03:17:33.945]  That's why they put the fluoride in the water, the flicker rate in the TV.
[03:17:34.505 --> 03:17:36.626]  Everything is about suppressing brainwaves.
[03:17:37.086 --> 03:17:37.726]  Consciousness.
[03:17:38.266 --> 03:17:45.109]  So that we don't go to the next level that we're meant to live in, and care about being honorable, and have a connection, and have discernment.
[03:17:45.449 --> 03:17:51.012]  They want us kind of dumbed down, and giggling, and cynical, and hateful, and mindless, and petty.
[03:17:52.102 --> 03:17:56.544]  So that we don't transcend up to a level to be able to commune with God.
[03:17:57.304 --> 03:18:05.108]  And the world is so complex, it's, again, it's, it's, it's, it's, one cannot be told about the matrix, one must see it.
[03:18:05.228 --> 03:18:15.972]  But everything is about suppressing our awakening, suppressing our development, because you live again through your children.
[03:18:17.393 --> 03:18:19.634]  But also those that live before us,
[03:18:20.967 --> 03:18:24.790]  It's not just our children that we're going to live through and their great-grandchildren.
[03:18:25.110 --> 03:18:28.053]  It's that we already are that expression of everybody before us.
[03:18:28.093 --> 03:18:43.526]  It's so epic on this planet with our ancestors seeing that same moon, that same sun, and all the experiences and the shared griefs and the racial, cultural memories are all there.
[03:18:45.263 --> 03:18:49.105]  And it's just so much more important than stupid Hollywood stuff.
[03:18:49.165 --> 03:18:54.789]  It's so much more important than somebody laughing at you because you're trying to warn them and it's their defense mechanism.
[03:18:55.049 --> 03:19:06.596]  You see what a sad victim they are who don't have any connection to their past or whose ancestors were just incredibly, you know, just servile slaves to the system.
[03:19:07.532 --> 03:19:21.038]  Being a slave, a lot of times means you're even stronger if you had that in your background, versus people that come from some place so corrupt and so evil that they're just a... I mean, people say that's a bad family, or that's a bad gene pool, that's a bad group of people.
[03:19:21.638 --> 03:19:28.281]  Well, you look at the globalists, they want to kill all of us, saying we've got bad gene pools, they've got the bad, psychopathic, predatory gene pools.
[03:19:29.322 --> 03:19:31.403]  And it's got to be dealt with.
[03:19:32.316 --> 03:19:33.477]  And so it comes down to that.
[03:19:33.497 --> 03:19:36.738]  This ancient battle that our ancestors fought with evil people.
[03:19:36.978 --> 03:19:38.919]  And everybody's got a mix of good and bad in their background.
[03:19:39.139 --> 03:19:41.280]  But it depends on the larger spectrum of it.
[03:19:41.480 --> 03:19:42.380]  And you do have free will.
[03:19:42.421 --> 03:19:43.161]  You can choose.
[03:19:43.821 --> 03:19:45.482]  You can choose what path you want to go down.
[03:19:46.607 --> 03:19:52.712]  But if you have a preponderance of good people in your background, you're going to gravitate towards the good, no matter what it takes.
[03:19:53.072 --> 03:19:58.497]  And then literally, I am a manifestation of all the people that came before me.
[03:19:58.797 --> 03:20:04.642]  And then it makes total sense that my ancestors acted just like I'm acting because it's who I am.
[03:20:04.902 --> 03:20:05.503]  I am them.
[03:20:05.903 --> 03:20:06.544]  They are me.
[03:20:06.604 --> 03:20:08.225]  It's incredible communion.
[03:20:09.827 --> 03:20:11.648]  If you own a business, you need customers, right?
[03:20:11.948 --> 03:20:15.051]  Well, your potential customers are listening to this radio program right now.
