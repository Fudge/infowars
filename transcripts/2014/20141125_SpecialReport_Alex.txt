[00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:11.058]  I want to warn you, what you're about to hear may actually break your conditioning.
[00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:14.380]  And it may make a lot of you out there incredibly angry.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.581]  It's understood.
[00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:24.886]  As the powder keg in Ferguson convulses with racist anarchy, let's take a deep breath and look into our hidden American history.
[00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:31.931]  And with these revelations, unchain ourselves from the mind control manipulating the way we see ourselves
[00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:33.332]  And each other.
[00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:56.428]  I think it's a disservice to the descendants of the victims of 1898 to have these monuments put up, have these programs every year, and not provide compensation.
[00:00:56.748 --> 00:01:06.313]  Ironically, history reveals that the Ku Klux Klan, founded roughly 30 years after the Democratic Party, served as the terrorist arm of the Democratic Party.
[00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:10.555]  The Democrats are essentially suing their own party and their own history.
[00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:27.024]  If that turn of events isn't strange enough, as a result of our weak understanding of our own history, take into account the call for reparations that has been a source of angst for African-descended Americans and a source of guilt for European-descended Americans since the U.S.
[00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:29.566]  Senate passed the 13th Amendment on April 8, 1864.
[00:01:31.638 --> 00:01:34.219]  Michigan Representative John Conyers, Jr.
[00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:36.500]  has reintroduced Bill H.R.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.903]  40, the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act, since 1989.
[00:01:41.443 --> 00:01:47.066]  This bill calls for the study of slavery and its impact on African Americans.
[00:01:47.631 --> 00:02:02.155]  If this bill were actually passed, they would soon discover the revelation that during the 17th century until the 19th century, hundreds of thousands of human cargo of men, women, and children were transported on British ships destined for the Americas.
[00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:05.516]  These people were subjected to horrific cruelty.
[00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:09.497]  Some burned alive or beheaded to serve as examples.
[00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:11.757]  From 1641 to 1652, the British killed 500,000 of them.
[00:02:15.478 --> 00:02:18.619]  While selling 300,000 of them into slavery.
[00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:29.764]  In the 1650's more than 100,000 children between the ages of 10 to 14 were ripped from their parents and sold as slaves into the West Indies, Virginia and Barbados.
[00:02:30.164 --> 00:02:38.388]  On one occasion, 1,302 slaves were dumped overboard into the Atlantic Ocean so that the ship's company would have enough food to eat.
[00:02:39.148 --> 00:02:43.652]  Once reaching the New World, they were manacled, beaten, and whipped on a regular basis.
[00:02:44.252 --> 00:02:46.354]  But these slaves weren't from Africa.
[00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:49.436]  These forgotten souls were from Ireland.
[00:02:50.317 --> 00:03:02.947]  In the wake of Oliver Cromwell's vicious occupation of Ireland that decimated the Irish population from 1.5 million to 600,000, nearly one million Irish natives and their descendants existed as slaves.
[00:03:03.607 --> 00:03:10.191]  Irish slaves were cheap at 5 sterling while African slaves were regarded as expensive at 50 sterling.
[00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:15.334]  Killing an Irish slave was of little concern compared to killing an expensive African slave.
[00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:29.623]  The interbreeding of Irish slave women with African slave men became so common that legislation was passed to halt it because the slave trade was suffering, due to the slave master's ability now to create his own slaves.
[00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:30.483]  U.S.
[00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:34.327]  history books promote the notion that the Irish were merely indentured servants.
[00:03:34.727 --> 00:03:42.354]  But recent research has uncovered the real conditions endured by the Irish-American ancestors of 11.9% of the U.S.
[00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:43.135]  population.
[00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:46.278]  Add that to the 14.1% of the U.S.
[00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:51.542]  population with African-American ancestors, and now at least a quarter of the U.S.
[00:03:51.582 --> 00:03:54.105]  population deserves reparations.
[00:03:54.665 --> 00:04:03.630]  Or we could just let go of the illusion that we are a nation separated by race and realize we're a nation of mutts and immigrants.
[00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:16.697]  Focus our energy and address the current fact that 21 million adults and children are bought and sold worldwide and thrown into commercial sexual servitude, forced and bonded labor.

[00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:34.567]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:37.129]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:47.138]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
