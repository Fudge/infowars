[00:00:01.492 --> 00:00:02.655]  Coast to Coast.
[00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:04.358]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.307]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:20.152]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.813 --> 00:00:21.614]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.415 --> 00:00:23.276]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:27.561]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:32.206]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:36.359]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:37.120]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.902]  I'll be your host for this first hour.
[00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:41.445]  Alex is going to be joining us in the second and third hour.
[00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:47.652]  He will also be joining us in this hour with a special report about some breaking news.
[00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:51.817]  He did a report with Joe Biggs last night about yet another
[00:00:52.598 --> 00:00:52.919]  U.S.
[00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.064]  Army base that is training for civilian unrest, but this one has a very troubling spin.
[00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:02.229]  This one they're singling out just black Americans.
[00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.173]  All of the people who are acting the role of the disturbers are all black.
[00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:17.099]  Now, you may not care about that because you're not black, but you need to understand that when the government comes after one group, that doesn't make you protected because you're in another group.
[00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:23.804]  I've heard many people say, you don't have to outrun the bear if you're in a crowd of people, you just have to outrun the slowest person.
[00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:29.116]  Well, the problem with that is that that bear is going to want another meal.
[00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:34.561]  You have to get in their face when they train against Tea Party people, when they train against guys in John Deere hats.
[00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:39.585]  We ought to all be concerned when they train against Christians or Libertarians.
[00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:44.710]  We should be concerned when they train against any particular demographic group because we should be concerned
[00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.252]  When our government is training to fight its own citizens, and they're doing it in place after place after place.
[00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:56.314]  Joe Biggs and I walked through the AP Hill asymmetric warfare center.
[00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:59.595]  There's also one in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina for the Marines.
[00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:04.157]  They're building American cities, training in those cities, training to fight Americans.
[00:02:04.217 --> 00:02:08.919]  This is yet another place, and we have a video that they analyzed that was posted.
[00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.151]  Up on the National Guard's own website.
[00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.233]  So we'll have that report in this hour.
[00:02:16.853 --> 00:02:17.814]  Some breaking news.
[00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:22.777]  Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has reportedly shot down over Ukraine.
[00:02:22.817 --> 00:02:25.379]  They fear that everyone on board has been lost.
[00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.601]  And of course this was shot down over the area where there is intense fighting in Donetsk.
[00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:33.764]  You have pro-Russian forces fighting the new Ukrainian government there.
[00:02:35.244 --> 00:02:37.986]  It's been reported by Fox News that it has been shot down.
[00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:39.667]  Other people just say that it is down.
[00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:41.888]  We'll have to see what's going on with that.
[00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:42.789]  That's developing right now.
[00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.452]  But everyone is in agreement as to the number of people that have died.
[00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:49.112]  All are feared lost.
[00:02:49.132 --> 00:02:51.854]  And that would be 295 people.
[00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:54.616]  That's what happens when you start wars.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.343]  See, there is a lot of collateral damage, and it doesn't just involve the people in that area.
[00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:07.626]  We're all very concerned this is something that's going to spin out of control into a worldwide war.
[00:03:09.127 --> 00:03:12.449]  If you look at the Cold War, how that's been revived,
[00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.872]  If you look at all the different factors, this is something we should all be very concerned about.
[00:03:16.912 --> 00:03:25.980]  And of course, we're in a situation now that is much more dangerous than the Cold War ever was, because we have this situation being brought out in the Ukraine.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.582]  We have fighting going on right on the Russian border.
[00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:30.764]  The Russians understand what's behind this.
[00:03:30.804 --> 00:03:32.405]  They know that the U.S.
[00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.247]  has openly bragged about funding this.
[00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:40.672]  You've also got wars being started by the American government in the Middle East, funding Al-Qaeda, training and funding ISIS.
[00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:46.335]  And then of course we have our own presence in multiple wars as our border is collapsing.
[00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:51.357]  There's never been a more dangerous time for America or for the world than right now.
[00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:55.238]  We are on the cusp of a very dangerous situation.
[00:03:55.698 --> 00:04:02.321]  There's also a very dangerous time if you look at, if you believe as I do, that there is a cyclical nature to human society.
[00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:07.723]  We're coming up to one of those major cycles and everything is starting to heat up.
[00:04:08.288 --> 00:04:10.610]  We also have an article that's up on the Drudge Report.
[00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.893]  Armed Homeland Security agents and community outreach.
[00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:18.637]  A community outreach to quote, let people know that they're in the area.
[00:04:18.677 --> 00:04:20.278]  This is a story by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:21.479]  It's currently up on the Drudge Report.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.804]  This is very reminiscent of what this Dallas County judge did last week.
[00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.431]  I don't think so.
[00:04:38.854 --> 00:04:50.060]  Went around door to door telling the people in the neighborhood that they could demonstrate, they could use their First Amendment rights, but just remember that you better stay within the law.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.702]  That kind of advanced intimidation, that's precisely what's going on in this article.
[00:04:53.782 --> 00:04:54.903]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:04:54.923 --> 00:04:56.524]  Now Homeland Security is doing the same thing.
[00:04:56.904 --> 00:05:00.026]  Just wanted to let you know that we're in the area, so watch your back.
[00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:03.768]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with that special report about the U.S.
[00:05:03.828 --> 00:05:05.969]  Army training to fight black Americans.
[00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.430]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.513 --> 00:05:14.255]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:15.536]  I didn't like taste dirt in it.
[00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:16.657]  God knows what's in this.
[00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:20.999]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:26.962]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:28.083]  That one is better.
[00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:29.104]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:05:29.384 --> 00:05:30.825]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:31.325]  It's good water.
[00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:37.189]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:44.475]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:05:44.655 --> 00:05:47.157]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:05:47.377 --> 00:05:55.303]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:05:55.443 --> 00:05:56.444]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:05:56.584 --> 00:05:57.465]  It's good water.
[00:05:57.645 --> 00:05:58.106]  Refreshing?
[00:05:58.126 --> 00:05:58.526]  It's good!
[00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:03.307]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:06:03.327 --> 00:06:06.108]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:06:06.348 --> 00:06:08.168]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:06:08.188 --> 00:06:09.288]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:24.273]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:06:24.473 --> 00:06:27.516]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:06:27.816 --> 00:06:29.138]  If so, consider this.
[00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:38.327]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:44.696]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:46.679]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:54.750]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:04.862]  Live Life Healthy!
[00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:16.282]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:20.688]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:25.616]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:28.638]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:07:28.938 --> 00:07:34.140]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:41.284]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:07:41.785 --> 00:07:45.567]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:07:45.927 --> 00:07:50.709]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.890]  This is innovating.
[00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:59.458]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[00:08:24.468 --> 00:08:26.372]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.355 --> 00:08:33.676]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:33.776 --> 00:08:34.476]  I'm David Knight.
[00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.177]  I'll be your host this first hour.
[00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:41.000]  We have a special report from Alex Jones and Joe Biggs about the U.S.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.702]  Army training to fight black Americans.
[00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:50.346]  But before we go to that report, I want to let you know that there's some breaking news out of the Ukraine and Malaysian Airlines.
[00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:53.548]  A Boeing 777 has reportedly been shot down over the Ukraine.
[00:08:54.048 --> 00:09:00.434]  This of course happened in the Donetsk area where there is fighting going on between pro-Russian forces and the new Ukrainian government.
[00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:03.416]  They fear that all passengers on board have been lost.
[00:09:03.496 --> 00:09:10.322]  That would be 295 people who have been killed now because of this war that the globalists have started there.
[00:09:11.903 --> 00:09:13.224]  This is the saddest
[00:09:14.364 --> 00:09:19.285]  aspect of war is when it spills out, and it's going to spill out, it's going to spill out of that area.
[00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:24.447]  It's already revived the Cold War, and we have to be very concerned that it's going to spill out in the entire world.
[00:09:24.487 --> 00:09:32.089]  It's not going to be just 295 people, it's going to be a lot of people dying from this, and of course a lot of people have already died in the Ukraine area.
[00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:40.251]  Fox News is reporting that they've been shot down, other people are saying it just crashed, but it suspiciously looks like it may have very well been shot down.
[00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:42.852]  Now before we go to this report, I want to read you
[00:09:43.672 --> 00:09:47.254]  A couple of headlines that are breaking in the news today and let you put this together.
[00:09:47.294 --> 00:09:49.235]  Just think of this as a collective.
[00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:50.796]  We have this story from yesterday.
[00:09:50.816 --> 00:09:52.877]  It's up on the Drudge Report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:09:53.377 --> 00:10:00.340]  Armed Homeland Security agents in a, quote, community outreach to, quote, let people know they're in the area.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.924]  Now, this is a lot of federal agents that were collecting in Greenville, North Carolina, just outside of a bankruptcy court.
[00:10:07.004 --> 00:10:07.804]  People were alarmed.
[00:10:07.864 --> 00:10:10.045]  They called the police to find out what's going on.
[00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:11.426]  Is there some kind of a terrorist attack?
[00:10:12.006 --> 00:10:16.007]  Well, they were told, no, they're just in the area to let you know that they're here.
[00:10:16.547 --> 00:10:29.031]  Just a little bit of intimidation, just like we saw from the Dallas County judge going door-to-door telling citizens, we don't want you demonstrating against the illegal aliens that we're going to be bringing into your community if you're going to break the law.
[00:10:29.051 --> 00:10:33.553]  And of course, they have a lot of laws about free speech in Dallas.
[00:10:33.593 --> 00:10:37.814]  Now, this county judge doesn't really have any authority to turn over that school.
[00:10:38.354 --> 00:10:44.398]  But because he was going around door-to-door intimidating people, he got to sit next to Obama when Obama came to Dallas.
[00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:52.163]  Rick Perry was sitting at the end of the table, but this county judge was sitting right in front of Obama, and you can see the pictures of Obama laughing.
[00:10:52.664 --> 00:10:54.805]  That's what happens when you toe the line.
[00:10:54.845 --> 00:10:57.006]  You get a seat at the table, quite literally.
[00:10:57.026 --> 00:11:04.932]  Now, later in the program, the second or third hour, we're going to have Joel Gilbert, the fellow who did the movie Dreams from My Real Father.
[00:11:05.816 --> 00:11:08.839]  He's going to be on about his new movie, No Place Like Utopia.
[00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:10.700]  We also have Peter Glidden.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.402]  They're both going to be interviewed by Alex Jones live here on the show.
[00:11:14.103 --> 00:11:18.046]  But two other stories before we go to the special report from Alex.
[00:11:18.506 --> 00:11:21.289]  Obama has attacked the Second Amendment with an executive order.
[00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:23.551]  This is a story up by CurtinMO on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:23.591 --> 00:11:29.555]  He outlaws Russian-made AK-47s with a stroke of his unconstitutional pen.
[00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:30.616]  That's right.
[00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:35.621]  Just declare that you can't have an entire line of rifles.
[00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:45.870]  And of course in the article he points out that the administration is saying that the sanctions are based on the UN and other international mandates.
[00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:49.614]  Would that be the UN Arms Trade Treaty that hasn't been ratified?
[00:11:50.314 --> 00:11:55.516]  And are multilateral in scope, and they involve close cooperation with allied governments.
[00:11:55.536 --> 00:11:58.337]  Well, we have a Second Amendment that prohibits that sort of thing.
[00:11:58.357 --> 00:12:14.084]  I think it's interesting to note, when they get rid of the AK-47, that one of the earliest, perhaps the earliest, infringement on the Second Amendment was a Supreme Court decision that outlawed sawed-off shotguns, saying that they were not military weapons, not usable by the militia.
[00:12:14.764 --> 00:12:16.305]  And so they outlawed sawed-off shotguns.
[00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:22.547]  Well, that was a lie then because they had already used them in the Civil War, sawed-off shotguns.
[00:12:22.607 --> 00:12:30.371]  But nevertheless, the idea that it can be infringed like this or by executive order just taken down.
[00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:36.173]  So we have Homeland Security going door-to-door in a small community just to let people know they're there.
[00:12:36.733 --> 00:12:42.016]  We have Obama just with a stroke of a pen outlawing a particular type of gun.
[00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:45.403]  Nobody has ever dreamed of doing that before.
[00:12:45.783 --> 00:12:48.845]  And now he's been given the kill switch to the entire communication system.
[00:12:49.565 --> 00:12:54.228]  They're going to connect the emergency broadcast system all together from a single point.
[00:12:54.248 --> 00:12:55.209]  It's been daisy-chained.
[00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:56.770]  They're extending the control of this.
[00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.711]  Alex has a special report on that as well.
[00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.372]  But now, this next element.
[00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:06.576]  And of course, that may be because he wants to communicate to everybody very quickly after a false flag incident.
[00:13:07.438 --> 00:13:09.119]  Now look at what they're training for.
[00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:14.262]  They've been talking about how their enemy is the Tea Party, Libertarians, Conservatives, Christians.
[00:13:14.342 --> 00:13:16.743]  Now they're going after blacks.
[00:13:16.883 --> 00:13:20.365]  And this is in a doomsday Disneyland, as they call it.
[00:13:20.385 --> 00:13:21.746]  This is a training facility.
[00:13:21.786 --> 00:13:23.347]  This is run by the National Guard.
[00:13:23.907 --> 00:13:26.509]  Now, of course, we've been to the Army's training facility at Fort A.P.
[00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:26.789]  Hill.
[00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:29.170]  I walked through that with Joe Biggs.
[00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.612]  We took pictures of the training facility there.
[00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:34.493]  There's also a training facility in Camp Lejeune.
[00:13:34.933 --> 00:13:42.256]  The one in Camp Lejeune for the Marines looks more like a, it's targeted more towards neighborhoods, towards rural farm areas.
[00:13:42.296 --> 00:13:43.696]  The one in A.P.
[00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:46.818]  Hill is more like an urban transportation center.
[00:13:46.838 --> 00:13:49.839]  There's a lot of things like trains and subways that they're training on.
[00:13:50.802 --> 00:13:58.364]  Now there's this one in the National Guard facility and here's a report from Alex Jones and Joe Biggs as they analyze it.
[00:13:58.864 --> 00:14:08.767]  Tonight we quite frankly have some extremely shocking information and that's in a news system that is just full of
[00:14:10.177 --> 00:14:23.146]  of incredibly disturbing things and we bring you this information not to scare you but to hopefully cause a debate in this country about the serious things that are happening so we can reverse what's unfolding.
[00:14:24.387 --> 00:14:30.311]  The Department of Homeland Security is always saying that if you see something, say something.
[00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:47.780]  Well, historically, when you see government buying millions of bullets, openly saying the American people are the main terror threat, openly saying that Christians and gun owners are the number one threat, even above Al Qaeda, and buying thousands of armored vehicles, and admitting
[00:14:48.945 --> 00:14:54.352]  That they plan to put regular army on the streets of every major city and town.
[00:14:55.053 --> 00:15:03.002]  And the government sets up a Rural Affairs Commission run by NORTHCOM and the Department of Defense to keep an eye on rural communities.
[00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:10.960]  While our government is openly funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS in the Middle East, you know that treason is taking place.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.942]  And so, we have seen something and we are saying something.
[00:15:15.102 --> 00:15:21.786]  And viewers out there, one of them will just go by CB, in places like Georgia,
[00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:28.630]  Are the HUMET, or the True Organic Human Intelligence, and our eyes and ears.
[00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:37.535]  And that's why Infowars.com every week breaks national news stories that get picked up by thousands of publications and national television.
[00:15:37.815 --> 00:15:41.177]  Because we are engaged in real journalism here.
[00:15:41.937 --> 00:15:44.258]  We go wherever the truth leads us.
[00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:49.159]  Now, we've seen a long slide towards a paramilitary police state in this country.
[00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:55.261]  I've been talking about it for a long time, made four films on the subject since the late 1990s, and we are now here.
[00:15:55.801 --> 00:15:59.282]  They've gone from denying that this is happening to admitting it.
[00:16:00.283 --> 00:16:02.543]  I struggle to put a headline on this.
[00:16:03.644 --> 00:16:07.145]  Regular Army Trains to Inter-Americans.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.301]  Regular Army trains to take over U.S.
[00:16:13.381 --> 00:16:13.761]  cities.
[00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:16.342]  But that doesn't encompass how bad this is.
[00:16:17.362 --> 00:16:19.762]  The end of Posse Comitatus, which it is.
[00:16:20.603 --> 00:16:27.884]  The 1878 law banning regular army engaging in law enforcement operations in the states.
[00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:31.565]  That's why the governors call out the National Guard, not the quote, big army.
[00:16:32.517 --> 00:16:33.257]  This is a big deal.
[00:16:34.198 --> 00:16:40.880]  And in 2007 and 2009, in the Defense Authorization Acts, in the National Defense Authorization Acts, they basically removed it.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.321]  And said, don't worry, we won't, you know, abuse this new power.
[00:16:44.802 --> 00:16:52.845]  As we see military at kite festivals in Austin, and we see the National Guard going under the President, not under the states.
[00:16:53.285 --> 00:17:01.408]  It's a major transference of power from the already weak states to the out-of-control central government, and there's a massive
[00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:10.777]  Ratcheting up from this training being secret when I first started reporting on it in 1996, to it now being out in the open.
[00:17:11.718 --> 00:17:24.490]  Back in 1996, 97, 98, I would go show Urban Warfare drills, they're practicing to confiscate guns, and the information was so shocking that they would have the media come out and say, no, Delta Force was not in Houston.
[00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:34.477]  Or Delta Force was not in San Antonio until I went and interviewed police chiefs and others that said, no, no, they're here and they're buying people off.
[00:17:35.198 --> 00:17:37.059]  It appears to be a covert takeover plan.
[00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:38.480]  Now, that was Clinton.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.401]  Now, under Obama, it's gone into full gear.
[00:17:40.862 --> 00:17:42.182]  Bush was involved in it as well.
[00:17:43.223 --> 00:17:45.966]  Just a fact, under Democrats, this stuff goes into high gear.
[00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:52.394]  And again, they're saying, domestically, Tea Party, Christians, we're veterans, are THE terror threat, not Al Qaeda.
[00:17:53.135 --> 00:17:55.257]  That is sensational information.
[00:17:55.277 --> 00:17:59.362]  And hopefully, if you get this video out to people, we're about to get into the details, we can, uh...
[00:18:00.253 --> 00:18:03.358]  Get a debate going in Congress at the state level about this.
[00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:06.543]  You out there as viewers have already spurred a debate about this.
[00:18:06.923 --> 00:18:09.066]  I talk to congressmen and women all the time on and off air.
[00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:13.613]  And they say they're having hearings on this precisely because of your work.
[00:18:13.934 --> 00:18:14.815]  So understand that here.
[00:18:15.578 --> 00:18:18.660]  It's like a horse and carriage, or it's like a lock and key.
[00:18:19.841 --> 00:18:20.642]  It goes together.
[00:18:20.782 --> 00:18:23.484]  You are the reason we know about this.
[00:18:23.524 --> 00:18:31.610]  This information you're about to see that is big army, regular army, trying to put black people behind barbed wire.
[00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:38.696]  I mean, that's the footage that you're about to see that a local who works in the area, I'll leave it at that,
[00:18:40.723 --> 00:18:42.924]  Keep seeing really scary stuff going on at the base.
[00:18:42.964 --> 00:18:56.773]  He sent us some photos of locked down cities, of collapse, of the highway shut down, of the military training for all sorts of draw and quarter and confiscation, blockading of cities and roads.
[00:18:57.234 --> 00:18:58.795]  He sent us some photos we're going to show you.
[00:18:58.835 --> 00:19:05.099]  They took with his GoPro from the highway, but he directed us to the YouTube website of Guardian Centers.
[00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:11.123]  Which is the privately owned facility that gets government contracts where this is going on.
[00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:13.165]  Now, this does not reflect on Guardian Centers.
[00:19:13.425 --> 00:19:17.368]  They've got all sorts of legitimate firefighter, police training, military training going on there.
[00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:20.190]  The issue is the training, not the center.
[00:19:20.931 --> 00:19:34.040]  The specifics of their own video about Guardian Center shows us hidden in plain view in between the images of the fire department getting people out of flooded cities to the military
[00:19:35.251 --> 00:19:43.036]  Apprehending, arresting citizens and handing them over to the police just like we saw in Katrina with the gun confiscation that they first tried to deny.
[00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:44.116]  That's the issue.
[00:19:44.136 --> 00:19:45.457]  We're going to have some more of that report.
[00:19:45.497 --> 00:19:46.598]  It's a very long report.
[00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:52.221]  We're going to have another segment of that coming up in the next segment and also in the segment following that.
[00:19:52.641 --> 00:19:53.161]  Stay with us.
[00:19:53.321 --> 00:19:57.104]  Alex is going to be talking to Peter Glidden as well as Joel Gilbert.
[00:19:57.184 --> 00:19:57.684]  Stay with us.
[00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:12.971]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird.
[00:20:13.552 --> 00:20:17.455]  Because they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases.
[00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:19.917]  Then my folks both got a Blocket Pocket.
[00:20:20.238 --> 00:20:22.660]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.322]  Dad knows it keeps his information private.
[00:20:25.702 --> 00:20:28.264]  I like my Blocket Pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking.
[00:20:28.685 --> 00:20:29.205]  Awesome!
[00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:31.987]  BlocketPocket.com has other cool stuff too.
[00:20:32.007 --> 00:20:34.309]  Huh, guess my parents aren't so weird.

[00:21:30.827 --> 00:21:34.911]  We're talking about Made in America belt buckles in nickel brass.
[00:21:35.011 --> 00:21:37.073]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:40.197]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[00:21:40.377 --> 00:21:46.003]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free

[00:22:08.829 --> 00:22:10.490]  Adam Miller here with Midas Resources.

[00:22:28.823 --> 00:22:29.944]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:30.064 --> 00:22:34.907]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.347 --> 00:22:36.027]  Wait a sec.
[00:22:36.228 --> 00:22:40.370]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next debt increase.
[00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.071]  And there's no end to this madness.

[00:24:11.699 --> 00:24:21.824]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:21.884 --> 00:24:23.545]  I'm David Knight here live in the studio.
[00:24:23.585 --> 00:24:25.667]  We have a special report that we've been going through.
[00:24:25.687 --> 00:24:28.368]  We're going to continue in this segment from Alex Jones.
[00:24:28.908 --> 00:24:29.869]  Got to bring you up to date.
[00:24:29.989 --> 00:24:34.551]  What's happened is today Obama has attacked the Second Amendment with an executive order.
[00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:37.373]  This is a story up on Infowars.com by Curt Nemo.
[00:24:37.993 --> 00:24:39.034]  He has outlawed
[00:24:39.674 --> 00:24:43.536]  Russian-made AK-47 rifles with a stroke of a pen.
[00:24:44.376 --> 00:24:47.897]  This is something that he's doing under the National Emergency Act.
[00:24:47.937 --> 00:24:59.642]  This is from the article, he says, the criminalization of an entire line of foreign manufactured firearms is possible under the national emergency powers and there is no appeal process.
[00:24:59.762 --> 00:25:02.463]  Well, there better be because if he can outlaw
[00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:08.099]  Any line of firearms, then he can outlaw all of them.
[00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:11.961]  And of course, they're making the excuse, the administration is saying, well, we're working with the UN.
[00:25:11.981 --> 00:25:15.403]  This is because of international mandates from the UN.
[00:25:15.423 --> 00:25:18.764]  Well, we have a mandate, it's called the Constitution, where you can't do that.
[00:25:18.784 --> 00:25:23.927]  But notice that he's doing this as part of the national emergency powers.
[00:25:24.507 --> 00:25:32.172]  At the same time, Obama is saying that he has, he's going to be given a kill switch to address the entire nation simultaneously.
[00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:33.175]  I think?
[00:25:53.078 --> 00:25:58.963]  Now we have this video that was given to us by someone who lives in the area where this training is going on.
[00:25:59.003 --> 00:26:08.070]  We've reported many times, and of course Alex has been reporting since the 1990s about these exercises that are training to fight American citizens.
[00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.891]  Everybody called him a conspiracy theorist.
[00:26:10.391 --> 00:26:11.913]  Well, nobody is saying that anymore.
[00:26:12.433 --> 00:26:16.196]  Still, nobody else is talking about this much outside of InfoWars.
[00:26:16.216 --> 00:26:19.739]  Let's continue with that analysis from Alex Jones and Joe Biggs.
[00:26:20.882 --> 00:26:23.944]  So let me just give you some of the background on this, the latest developments.
[00:26:24.384 --> 00:26:26.005]  Here's an article from 2009.
[00:26:26.986 --> 00:26:31.588]  The Pentagon wants authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[00:26:31.648 --> 00:26:32.469]  from the progressive.
[00:26:33.069 --> 00:26:35.050]  But it was also in the Associated Press at the time.
[00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.313]  And they are now moving the troops back out of the Middle East and other areas.
[00:26:40.802 --> 00:26:49.009]  to the United States for what they call Brigade Homeland that is famously also in the Stars and Stripes and Army Times.
[00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:50.951]  Here's another one, Clarksville online.
[00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:54.674]  101 airborne soldiers to conduct air assault training in Troy, Tennessee.
[00:26:55.094 --> 00:26:59.998]  Again, this is all conditioning the public, the troops, everybody to just accept this.
[00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:01.860]  So the troops aren't villains in this.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.983]  In fact, they're the most elite group out there because of this going on.
[00:27:06.344 --> 00:27:07.245]  We're talking about the training.
[00:27:08.234 --> 00:27:10.978]  That's being directed from the White House to the National Security Council.
[00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:13.522]  Not about Guardian Centers, not about the troops.
[00:27:13.542 --> 00:27:14.624]  I want to be clear.
[00:27:14.644 --> 00:27:19.932]  Because we've learned the propaganda they use on the police and military is, see, they're criticizing you and you're just trying to help people.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:25.584]  No, we're pointing out what's going on inside of these larger operations.
[00:27:26.084 --> 00:27:27.085]  The real operations.
[00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:28.106]  Here's another one.
[00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:33.289]  Accepting FEMA camp prisoners for illegal immigrants justifies them for Americans.
[00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:39.894]  We're going to go through this, then get to the footage of the black people being thrown in basically the FEMA center, the mock FEMA center.
[00:27:41.435 --> 00:27:42.056]  Again, back in 2011.
[00:27:44.719 --> 00:27:56.025]  We posted articles warning of the fact that under Rex 84, which is a public plan, they would use the collapse of borders as a pretext to suspend the Constitution and bring in martial law.
[00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:05.095]  And at the Guardian Centers, the training is moving towards what is clearly civil emergency or martial law.
[00:28:05.675 --> 00:28:18.886]  And right here in this article from two years ago, where they were finishing the center, they admit they have a whole area to simulate New Orleans Ninth Ward and what was done there and to be submerged just like Katrina.
[00:28:19.426 --> 00:28:24.527]  Just like the gun confiscation that we witnessed there.
[00:28:24.547 --> 00:28:27.828]  There's also a CNN article that breaks this down.
[00:28:28.548 --> 00:28:30.989]  Take a tour of the Doomsday Disneyland.
[00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:37.490]  And again, that is this Guardian Center facility, one of the largest in the world, where this is going on.
[00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.171]  And here's the issue.
[00:28:38.411 --> 00:28:39.991]  Why don't they use military bases for this?
[00:28:40.431 --> 00:28:47.673]  Because it's not traditional and sends up red flags to have police and military together
[00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:51.434]  Training at a military base, even though that's going on covertly.
[00:28:51.934 --> 00:28:54.875]  So they're now doing at these giant private centers.
[00:28:55.375 --> 00:28:58.596]  Now, let's go to the big enchilada before we get to the video.
[00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:04.398]  Interment resettlement operations, we broke this a couple years ago, when it was sent to us by military sources.
[00:29:05.479 --> 00:29:08.860]  After that happened, they posted it on army.mil, kind of, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.280]  See, you got a secret document, we'll just put it out.
[00:29:12.021 --> 00:29:12.501]  No big deal.
[00:29:13.573 --> 00:29:14.194]  Oh, it's no big deal, Bob.
[00:29:14.214 --> 00:29:15.234]  Oh, I was just doing a gynecology exam.
[00:29:15.254 --> 00:29:15.635]  They released FM3-39.40.
[00:29:27.546 --> 00:29:30.408]  And this document... All right, we're going to continue with this report.
[00:29:30.448 --> 00:29:31.488]  This is a short segment.
[00:29:31.508 --> 00:29:33.770]  We're going to have the rest of this report in the next segment.
[00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.432]  This entire report, special report, very, very important.
[00:29:37.472 --> 00:29:39.833]  It's going to be posted up on the YouTube site.
[00:29:40.433 --> 00:29:41.554]  It is 28 minutes long.
[00:29:41.594 --> 00:29:43.815]  We played two segments, last two segments.
[00:29:43.855 --> 00:29:44.796]  We played excerpts from that.
[00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:47.217]  We're going to have the rest of that in this next segment.
[00:29:47.237 --> 00:29:50.619]  And, of course, Alex is going to be back live in the studio.
[00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:53.701]  He's going to be interviewing Joel Gilbert and Dr. Peter Glidden.
[00:29:53.721 --> 00:29:54.381]  So stay with us.
[00:29:54.442 --> 00:29:55.022]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:59.235 --> 00:30:02.243]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.165 --> 00:30:05.851]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.745 --> 00:30:12.526]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:30:13.047 --> 00:30:20.011]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:30.878]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:40.545]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:30:41.265 --> 00:30:44.686]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:30:45.327 --> 00:30:48.768]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:30:49.068 --> 00:30:50.688]  Experience the new formula.
[00:30:51.148 --> 00:30:53.129]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:30:53.709 --> 00:30:54.730]  Shield your family.
[00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.450]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.471]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:00.031 --> 00:31:03.993]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:16.230]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.492]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:31:18.693 --> 00:31:23.799]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:31:23.979 --> 00:31:28.925]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:31:29.125 --> 00:31:32.186]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:31:32.446 --> 00:31:36.307]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:31:36.527 --> 00:31:40.768]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:31:40.848 --> 00:31:50.871]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:31:51.071 --> 00:31:53.592]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:31:53.792 --> 00:32:01.839]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:32:01.999 --> 00:32:05.962]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:11.805]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[00:32:12.025 --> 00:32:16.911]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:19.275]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[00:32:24.121 --> 00:32:24.301]  I think?
[00:32:44.369 --> 00:32:51.651]  Five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[00:32:51.931 --> 00:32:55.472]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[00:32:55.812 --> 00:33:02.054]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[00:33:02.414 --> 00:33:07.495]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[00:33:16.391 --> 00:33:27.296]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:33:31.498 --> 00:33:34.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:40.313]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:40.493 --> 00:33:45.199]  I'm David Knight, but Alex is going to be joining us in the next hour live in the studio.
[00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:47.402]  He's working on a breaking story right now.
[00:33:48.002 --> 00:33:52.528]  We've been playing a special report that he shot with Joe Biggs about a new
[00:33:54.784 --> 00:33:55.745]  Army Training Center.
[00:33:55.785 --> 00:34:00.608]  Actually, it's not new, but it's newly found out that they're training to fight black Americans.
[00:34:00.648 --> 00:34:06.672]  And again, this is yet another example of what Alex has been talking about since the 1990s.
[00:34:07.192 --> 00:34:10.954]  And of course, it was always a conspiracy theory, but now they're putting the videos up.
[00:34:11.014 --> 00:34:14.677]  They're shooting the videos and putting them on the internet instead of denying that it's happening.
[00:34:15.177 --> 00:34:16.318]  So he's breaking that down for us.
[00:34:16.338 --> 00:34:17.599]  Let's go back to that report.
[00:34:17.999 --> 00:34:22.482]  But before we do, I want to let you know that Fluoride Shield is now available at a 25% off special offer.
[00:34:24.443 --> 00:34:38.313]  InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield is an exclusive blend of key herbs and ingredients specifically infused with the formulas to help support the elimination of toxic forms of fluoride and other dangerous compounds like mercury, chlorine, and bromine from within the body.
[00:34:38.853 --> 00:34:41.535]  Right now, you can get it at 25% off.
[00:34:41.595 --> 00:34:44.637]  Of course, you can't carry your water filter with you everywhere you go.
[00:34:45.078 --> 00:34:49.421]  This is a way to get the fluoride out that you're going to pick up as you're traveling around.
[00:34:49.941 --> 00:34:53.282]  A great product that you can find at Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:53.302 --> 00:34:55.262]  Right now, 25% off.
[00:34:55.822 --> 00:35:01.224]  Let's go back to the special report that Alex is breaking down, and this is something we should all be concerned about.
[00:35:01.264 --> 00:35:05.345]  You should be concerned that the government is training to fight American citizens.
[00:35:05.405 --> 00:35:14.887]  Whether it's not the demographic group that you're in or not, it is still not something we want to see happen, especially when we look at the fact that Obama, by executive order,
[00:35:15.427 --> 00:35:29.993]  Has just banned all future purchases of AK-47s saying that he has the powers under a National Emergency Act and he has been given a kill switch to the entire communications system so that he can immediately address everyone.
[00:35:30.013 --> 00:35:31.894]  That's something that's never happened before.
[00:35:32.614 --> 00:35:35.556]  Does he need those two things because they're planning a false flag?
[00:35:35.976 --> 00:35:38.017]  Because they're planning to fight American citizens?
[00:35:38.678 --> 00:35:40.519]  That's something they've been talking about since Rex 84.
[00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:43.781]  Remember Oliver North, Ronald Reagan?
[00:35:44.241 --> 00:35:46.102]  1984, that's where the name comes from, Rex 84.
[00:35:46.843 --> 00:35:48.744]  Alex Jones continues to break this down for us.
[00:35:48.784 --> 00:35:49.985]  Let's continue with that report.
[00:35:50.565 --> 00:35:51.726]  They released FM3-39.40 and this document
[00:35:56.058 --> 00:35:59.060]  It says social security numbers, how to round up the American people.
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:11.267]  We have articles on InfoWars.com about it where you can see the subsections where more than 20 times it says American citizens, social security numbers, how to process, how to get our biometrics, just like we were citizens of Fallujah, Iraq.
[00:36:11.327 --> 00:36:13.068]  It goes through all of it.
[00:36:13.208 --> 00:36:15.510]  First they tried to deny it, then they admitted it.
[00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.632]  We've also seen training in places like
[00:36:19.312 --> 00:36:28.198]  Arcadia, Iowa, where they said in the paper, they're working with a local gun shop and the citizens do door-to-door gun confiscation drill for training here in America.
[00:36:28.779 --> 00:36:31.400]  Once that blew up, they started to back off.
[00:36:32.121 --> 00:36:47.312]  We got the governor to respond in Tennessee a few years ago when they had regular army with National Guard, state police, ATF, the FBI, local police, all putting them under a unified federal FEMA command running an illegal checkpoint on one of the major highway searching vehicles.
[00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:53.998]  So again, this is just changing the culture, bringing all of this in.
[00:36:54.539 --> 00:37:00.164]  But I want to play from a promotional video put out by Guardian Centers.
[00:37:01.386 --> 00:37:03.087]  Some of the video for you right now.
[00:37:04.068 --> 00:37:17.921]  And we've been showing some of it as well while I've been talking here, where, again, interspersed with the firefighters and other legitimate things, it shows the military rounding people up, and every one of them is black.
[00:37:18.702 --> 00:37:20.203]  Now that's newsworthy right there.
[00:37:21.785 --> 00:37:28.711]  I've been to these drills where they all are farmers, wearing John Deere caps and stuff, saying, you know, you can't take my land, you can't take my guns.
[00:37:29.839 --> 00:37:30.820]  Very scary stuff.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.582]  But it was a black farmer, white farmer, Hispanic farmer.
[00:37:34.442 --> 00:37:36.304]  Little extra black folks.
[00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:40.787]  I mean, obviously saying, oh, it's for Al-Qaeda, that's a bad group, but it's really for all Americans.
[00:37:41.227 --> 00:37:44.270]  Oh, well, blacks, you know, they're kind of looked down on quietly by some people.
[00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.111]  Oh, look, it's for blacks, so it's okay.
[00:37:46.131 --> 00:37:48.433]  And it's military and white guys.
[00:37:49.747 --> 00:37:55.570]  White civilians looking on as groups of blacks tump over cars and, you know, get rounded up and thrown behind barbed wire.
[00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.210]  I mean, this is pretty outrageous.
[00:37:57.691 --> 00:38:01.872]  But don't expect Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, the race baiters, to say anything.
[00:38:02.733 --> 00:38:12.137]  They're just there to create more racial division in this country, not actually point out that there's preparation to target black communities, which are under gun control like Chicago and has the highest crime rate in the world.
[00:38:13.308 --> 00:38:18.516]  Which are under the fake drug war that's bringing down Chicago, just like Mexico's collapsing.
[00:38:18.917 --> 00:38:22.362]  It's the policies that are causing this cultural collapse.
[00:38:22.402 --> 00:38:26.028]  But here's some of the promotional video, hiding in plain view.
[00:38:36.593 --> 00:38:39.654]  For those of you who are listening, this is video footage.
[00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:44.536]  This is a black lady who's getting beaten by some soldiers here.
[00:38:44.556 --> 00:38:46.477]  They've got concertino wire that they've set up.
[00:38:47.437 --> 00:38:55.561]  And as you can see, if you're looking at the video live on our website, everyone who is a... Let me show you just a few more articles.
[00:38:55.621 --> 00:38:56.281]  There is black.
[00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:59.022]  We'll give you a larger picture as we connect the dots here.
[00:38:59.042 --> 00:39:12.108]  Then we're going to go to Staff Sergeant, retired Joe Biggs, to specifically analyze some of this video that shows regular Army engaging in civilian suppression, basically, nor the way to describe it.
[00:39:13.028 --> 00:39:15.870]  Look at this headline from today that was picked up by DrudgeReport.com.
[00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.112]  We're going to show a short clip from the larger newscast here in just a moment.
[00:39:20.553 --> 00:39:28.598]  Armed Homeland Security agents in community outreach to let people know they're in the area and to remind them about the snitch program.
[00:39:29.178 --> 00:39:30.599]  And we'll go ahead and play a clip of that now.
[00:39:31.167 --> 00:39:33.189]  Again, it is essential to understand, we are seeing a explosion.
[00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:59.854]  Of paramilitary preparation for gun confiscation, martial law, roundup, civil unrest, you name it.
[00:40:00.195 --> 00:40:01.856]  Is it the border being collapsed by design?
[00:40:01.896 --> 00:40:02.476]  Is that part of it?
[00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:03.157]  Clearly.
[00:40:03.657 --> 00:40:05.959]  Is it the dollar being deserted worldwide by design?
[00:40:06.259 --> 00:40:06.580]  Clearly.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.182]  Is it war in Ukraine and possible war with Russia?
[00:40:09.922 --> 00:40:10.243]  Clearly.
[00:40:11.297 --> 00:40:23.308]  The issue is it's George Soros and the globalists, on record, bragging they're behind the open borders and the Open Border Society, that they're behind the Ukraine takeover, that they're behind ISIS and the Arab Spring.
[00:40:24.049 --> 00:40:27.311]  I mean, they are starting what appears to be the beginning of World War III right now.
[00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:34.278]  That's where all this leads, and the government is on full drill to lock everything down and come after the American people.
[00:40:35.379 --> 00:40:37.300]  So this is really an emergency alert here.
[00:40:38.314 --> 00:40:48.386]  And again, a few years ago, we saw these weird internal Homeland Security training videos, and then public ones about See Something Say Something, where every terrorist was a white business executive.
[00:40:49.227 --> 00:40:50.869]  And I said, they're rebranding to the Tea Party.
[00:40:50.929 --> 00:40:51.249]  Watch.
[00:40:51.409 --> 00:40:52.310]  And they've done that now.
[00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:53.452]  I mean, you can see it.
[00:40:53.872 --> 00:40:56.736]  First, internal, saying our new enemy is the Tea Party, white people.
[00:40:58.712 --> 00:40:59.613]  Then it goes public.
[00:41:00.233 --> 00:41:01.334]  Then it becomes policy.
[00:41:01.614 --> 00:41:03.836]  People said, oh, you're just being racist, worried about white people.
[00:41:03.936 --> 00:41:04.176]  No.
[00:41:04.717 --> 00:41:14.284]  If there's videos where all the terrorists are white people, and then internally they say the enemy is the Tea Party and gun owners, you know what's next, and we were proven right.
[00:41:14.704 --> 00:41:18.808]  Well, when it's showing nothing but black people, I've got a big concern as well.
[00:41:19.574 --> 00:41:30.999]  I got a concern if it was showing black, white, hispanic, asian, but they're doing it to kind of sell the idea, well this is a troublemaking group, the army's only for them, so the general public will accept it.
[00:41:32.159 --> 00:41:45.425]  So, they're showing minority communities that we're going to take the rights of whitey, and they're showing, you know, the law enforcement, you know, community that's in some areas, I guess, a white bastion or whatever, oh, it's for the blacks, no folks,
[00:41:46.826 --> 00:41:47.546]  It's for everybody.
[00:41:48.026 --> 00:41:57.090]  Who was the German preacher that said, first they came for the communists, and I wasn't a communist, said nothing, and then they came for the labor unions, I wasn't a labor union, then they came for me, and there was no one else to stand up?
[00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.971]  This is for everybody.
[00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:01.752]  This is about taking your pension funds, it's about taking over.
[00:42:03.305 --> 00:42:07.287]  You can look up, again, the Army Times, you name it, admitting that they want to set up Brigade Homeland.
[00:42:07.307 --> 00:42:08.127]  That was six years ago.
[00:42:08.467 --> 00:42:09.187]  They've now done it.
[00:42:09.487 --> 00:42:10.368]  They're rolling it out.
[00:42:10.908 --> 00:42:11.868]  I mentioned this article.
[00:42:11.928 --> 00:42:14.369]  Guardsmen to conduct urban training at Arcadia in April.
[00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:21.572]  They admitted gun confiscation, drilling here, and they got all upset when we said that and reported on it and said that they hadn't said that.
[00:42:21.932 --> 00:42:22.813]  We had the Colonel on.
[00:42:23.653 --> 00:42:29.056]  We've also got FEMA camp prisoners, again we mentioned that, using the illegals to prime that pump.
[00:42:29.676 --> 00:42:33.058]  We have the governor responding and saying the feds can't do that anymore after Tennessee.
[00:42:33.479 --> 00:42:46.466]  So that's the good news is that you can say no to all this, but for those that are in denial about posse comitatus and what the NDAA has changed in the last few years incrementally to where there's nothing left,
[00:42:47.509 --> 00:43:03.295]  I wanted to go to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, retired, to give us his breakdown because he served in Iraq and Afghanistan with a lot of the groups that are now coming home to literally go after the American people as veterans can't get health care and are getting the word they can't buy guns anymore.
[00:43:03.655 --> 00:43:16.859]  With no evidence or, you know, no reason at all, this is now pointed at us and the military appreciates these transmissions because on average I can't imagine a group more informed than Army and Marines, Air Force, you name it.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.260]  Because again, they're decompartmentalized.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.061]  They're in the middle of this.
[00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:21.261]  They see what's happening.
[00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:25.222]  Joe, before you analyze these patches for folks, I want to get your take overall.
[00:43:25.262 --> 00:43:26.843]  You've been sitting here tonight while we're
[00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:34.005]  Well, one of the things I like that you said is that the veterans overseas are getting ready to come home to this, and it reminded me of the past few days.
[00:43:34.025 --> 00:43:35.526]  I have a buddy who's stationed in Japan.
[00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:37.287]  I've got another that's in Afghanistan.
[00:43:49.724 --> 00:43:56.449]  They can't see a lot of these websites, and they're coming to me and saying, hey Joe, what's really happening in America right now?
[00:43:56.509 --> 00:43:57.630]  What's going on at the border?
[00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.972]  Why is our police being militarized so much?
[00:44:01.873 --> 00:44:04.775]  And I have to tell them, and it breaks their heart every single time.
[00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.737]  They're like, why is this happening right now?
[00:44:07.017 --> 00:44:09.559]  Am I really going to come home to this right now?
[00:44:09.899 --> 00:44:12.661]  And they're scared of what's happening to America right now.
[00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:14.702]  Because they're not traitors.
[00:44:15.003 --> 00:44:15.543]  Yeah, they're not.
[00:44:15.563 --> 00:44:17.004]  They don't want anything to do with this.
[00:44:17.584 --> 00:44:20.887]  You know, most of them go over there, like I said, for a good purpose.
[00:44:20.927 --> 00:44:23.669]  You know, a lot of them want the college, the benefits, something like that.
[00:44:23.709 --> 00:44:27.692]  None of them want to go and come back and be trained to take over cities here in America.
[00:44:28.052 --> 00:44:28.813]  No one has that.
[00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:29.893]  No one wants to do that.
[00:44:29.913 --> 00:44:32.155]  Well, a lot of them do it because of family, like your dad.
[00:44:32.335 --> 00:44:33.416]  Yeah, my father.
[00:44:33.456 --> 00:44:35.618]  I mean, it was in my blood to join the military.
[00:44:36.378 --> 00:44:38.119]  My father did it, my great-grandfather.
[00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:41.180]  And it's just something that we did in our family.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.861]  If you're a male, you join the military.
[00:44:44.061 --> 00:44:45.082]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:44:45.502 --> 00:44:54.686]  And a lot of these guys are seeing what's happening back here and it's literally breaking their heart every day to know that our country is slipping away while they're over there fighting for their country.
[00:44:55.848 --> 00:45:00.613]  Well, I want Joe, the people that are running this, to know that they're not doing this in the dark.
[00:45:01.633 --> 00:45:04.576]  The military is over 85% awake.
[00:45:05.437 --> 00:45:06.178]  That's what I've found.
[00:45:06.278 --> 00:45:07.359]  Even officers on the street.
[00:45:07.479 --> 00:45:07.939]  Well, I agree.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.181]  Completely.
[00:45:09.861 --> 00:45:13.265]  Everybody I talk to is 100% with the information we're putting out.
[00:45:13.305 --> 00:45:14.406]  They're saying that's spot on.
[00:45:16.107 --> 00:45:17.629]  What do you think the establishment's thinking?
[00:45:17.649 --> 00:45:18.670]  I mean, they're not going to get away with this.
[00:45:19.688 --> 00:45:20.489]  I just don't understand.
[00:45:20.529 --> 00:45:23.591]  I mean, this video we're about to show, it's not National Guard.
[00:45:23.892 --> 00:45:26.434]  That's their job to take care of stuff here back in the homeland.
[00:45:26.694 --> 00:45:33.399]  This is Big Army, Regular Army, 3rd Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry, 1st Armored Division.
[00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:34.520]  This is the tip of the spear?
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:34.780]  Yes!
[00:45:35.561 --> 00:45:36.642]  Explain to folks what that means.
[00:45:36.662 --> 00:45:37.802]  I mean, this is not just regular army.
[00:45:38.022 --> 00:45:39.843]  This is the absolute shock forces.
[00:45:40.063 --> 00:45:40.303]  Yes.
[00:45:41.063 --> 00:45:42.844]  3rd ID is one of the biggest infantry units.
[00:45:42.884 --> 00:45:44.165]  They're some of the first ones to go in.
[00:45:44.765 --> 00:45:47.086]  1st Armored Division is one of the biggest armored.
[00:45:47.526 --> 00:45:49.927]  You know, your tanks, your paladins, things like that.
[00:45:49.967 --> 00:45:53.129]  And 1st Cavalry is one of the biggest cavalry divisions there is.
[00:45:53.589 --> 00:46:01.912]  So they've got the three biggest guys in there right now training at this place for, you know, an apparent martial law takeover.
[00:46:02.172 --> 00:46:02.933]  It's unbelievable.
[00:46:04.013 --> 00:46:05.734]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:46:05.815 --> 00:46:06.795]  It's really happening.
[00:46:06.815 --> 00:46:10.078]  We've seen the signs for a long time, but it was over the horizon.
[00:46:10.138 --> 00:46:11.619]  Now it's in our face.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:19.085]  And before we get to these patches, a little bit of gallows humor here, some comic relief, but it's also a good analogy.
[00:46:19.826 --> 00:46:23.569]  If you think about the first Ghostbusters movie, I think it's a great comedy.
[00:46:24.409 --> 00:46:28.253]  They're talking about normal paranormal activity being the size of a Twinkie.
[00:46:29.634 --> 00:46:33.517]  And now the paranormal activity is the size of a giant, you know, 20, 40 foot long Twinkie.
[00:46:34.019 --> 00:46:40.382]  Well, let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area.
[00:46:41.343 --> 00:46:48.347]  According to this morning's sample, it would be a Twinkie 35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds.
[00:46:49.928 --> 00:46:52.169]  That's a big Twinkie.
[00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:55.731]  Normal paramilitary activity in a free society doesn't exist.
[00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:57.172]  It isn't going on.
[00:46:57.992 --> 00:47:00.954]  Now it's just off the charts giant, is the point.
[00:47:01.394 --> 00:47:03.295]  And it's accelerating, it's building.
[00:47:04.986 --> 00:47:10.669]  You can see it, it's like an enemy army lining up against your border for war, but it's not even a foreign country.
[00:47:11.169 --> 00:47:13.030]  It's our own military, that's why they're freaking out.
[00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:15.071]  Do you think that's a good analogy, Joe?
[00:47:15.352 --> 00:47:15.852]  Oh, definitely.
[00:47:15.872 --> 00:47:27.318]  I mean, it's... Just imagine opening up and you're sitting in your house and you hear explosions, you hear helicopters flying overhead, and you peek through your blind real quick and you look outside, and it's U.S.
[00:47:27.358 --> 00:47:30.880]  military, it's army, with American flags on their shoulders, and you're sitting there like,
[00:47:31.991 --> 00:47:33.092]  Why are you on our streets?
[00:47:33.132 --> 00:47:33.872]  What are you doing here?
[00:47:33.972 --> 00:47:35.513]  And they admit that's to acclimate everyone.
[00:47:35.533 --> 00:47:36.553]  Look at the Boston bombing.
[00:47:36.573 --> 00:47:37.114]  Yeah, ease it in.
[00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:37.714]  You ease it in.
[00:47:38.054 --> 00:47:38.955]  Look at the Boston bombing.
[00:47:38.975 --> 00:47:39.915]  Going to everybody's houses.
[00:47:40.436 --> 00:47:41.556]  Oh, you're a black lady.
[00:47:41.596 --> 00:47:42.397]  You're a blonde-haired lady.
[00:47:42.417 --> 00:47:43.977]  You look nothing like the guy we're looking for.
[00:47:43.997 --> 00:47:45.578]  We're going to drag you out with a gun to your head.
[00:47:45.918 --> 00:47:47.239]  We're going to drive around pointing guns at you.
[00:47:47.259 --> 00:47:48.360]  It's all a power grab.
[00:47:49.286 --> 00:47:51.247]  Yeah, it's mind-blowing.
[00:47:52.668 --> 00:47:56.049]  Every day that something passes like this, I just don't understand how we're getting to this.
[00:47:56.149 --> 00:47:57.330]  What does your gut tell you?
[00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:04.293]  Is it all of the collapsing border, the dollar, the staged takeover, or is it one of those things, the collapsing border war with Russia?
[00:48:04.593 --> 00:48:06.414]  Why do you think they've got this in such high gear?
[00:48:07.366 --> 00:48:11.169]  Well, the thing with the border, I'm thinking they want to import this poverty.
[00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:18.135]  They want to, essentially, we're pulling the Border Patrol agents away from the border, and then they're talking about bringing in National Guard.
[00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:19.296]  So what does that do?
[00:48:19.336 --> 00:48:20.697]  That starts scaring people.
[00:48:21.037 --> 00:48:24.200]  You start seeing National Guard up and down the streets, you're thinking martial law.
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:24.840]  It's the cover.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.601]  It's the cover.
[00:48:25.641 --> 00:48:26.982]  It's the first phase, I agree.
[00:48:27.522 --> 00:48:27.943]  Completely.
[00:48:28.343 --> 00:48:50.922]  Once that happens on the border and it becomes everyday norm that you're seeing the tanks rolling up and down the streets, the Humvees, the MRAPs, the soldiers with the M4s strapped to their chests, next thing you have these guys, the big army, coming in, the 1st Armored Division, the 1st Cav, 3rd Infantry Division, these guys will be on the streets in the MRAPs along with the militarized police as well.
[00:48:52.203 --> 00:48:53.004]  God Almighty.
[00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:57.086]  And the public will think they're here to help with the collapse.
[00:48:57.866 --> 00:48:59.287]  It's protect and serve, you know.
[00:48:59.567 --> 00:49:02.688]  And then it will set the precedent that we're permanently under martial law.
[00:49:02.768 --> 00:49:03.889]  Yeah, completely.
[00:49:03.909 --> 00:49:05.490]  That's exactly what they're going for.
[00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.371]  But they're going to call it civil emergency.
[00:49:07.971 --> 00:49:11.113]  Once it happens, most of these people that are asleep and sheeple,
[00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:14.893]  They won't even care, because it's gradually happened.
[00:49:15.193 --> 00:49:19.538]  The people who are awake right now, we're the ones that are pulling our hair out every day, you know, just stressed out.
[00:49:19.578 --> 00:49:21.761]  We see the tyranny, we see what's happening.
[00:49:22.282 --> 00:49:23.503]  These guys aren't even paying attention.
[00:49:23.523 --> 00:49:24.704]  When it happens, they won't even care.
[00:49:25.465 --> 00:49:32.513]  They're bringing us into a permanent emergency, and the groups that are waking up are political people that are savvy patriots, because we're the targets.
[00:49:33.524 --> 00:49:33.864]  I don't think so.
[00:49:50.649 --> 00:49:51.329]  They can't fight back.
[00:49:51.369 --> 00:49:52.810]  You're taking enemy away.
[00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:53.670]  That's what they're doing.
[00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:54.170]  They're planning.
[00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.091]  They're saying, hey, these guys are trained.
[00:49:56.111 --> 00:49:58.511]  They have the information, the knowledge to defeat us.
[00:49:58.812 --> 00:50:02.173]  We're going to deny them the health care they need so they can't fight back.
[00:50:02.373 --> 00:50:06.274]  When we roll on this martial law, these guys will be dead in the street basically laying there.
[00:50:06.994 --> 00:50:10.576]  Internal bleeding, whatever's going on, unable to fight back after so long.
[00:50:10.696 --> 00:50:11.657]  You're talking about yourself.
[00:50:11.677 --> 00:50:27.607]  What do you think of the illegals in South Texas to get this $60 million facility where they have $1,000 rooms and with spas, hot tubs, tennis courts, down there at a luxury facility that the government's about to buy for them?
[00:50:27.918 --> 00:50:31.281]  We're opening up all these centers for these illegal aliens, but we're not doing anything.
[00:50:31.301 --> 00:50:34.563]  Okay, we're going to have the rest of that report in the last segment again.
[00:50:34.623 --> 00:50:35.864]  That was a very long special report.
[00:50:35.904 --> 00:50:37.526]  It was part of the nightly news last night.
[00:50:37.546 --> 00:50:40.708]  If you're not a subscriber, you need to become a subscriber to Prison Planet TV.
[00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:44.831]  It helps to support our operation, but it's something that you can share with other people.
[00:50:44.892 --> 00:50:48.014]  You can also see that full report up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:48.074 --> 00:50:50.156]  It's Paul Joseph Watson's story, U.S.
[00:50:50.236 --> 00:50:52.157]  Army Training to Fight Black Americans.
[00:50:52.197 --> 00:50:55.200]  We'll be right back, and Alex will be joining us in the next hour.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.567]  We're working on a breaking story right now, but he'll be with us in the next hour with Joel Gilbert and Dr. Peter Glitten.
[00:51:00.627 --> 00:51:01.068]  Stay with us.

[00:51:39.468 --> 00:51:48.692]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:49.492]  This capitalism?
[00:51:49.552 --> 00:51:55.674]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:55.714 --> 00:51:59.355]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:53:08.716 --> 00:53:13.738]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives Ed peace of mind.
[00:53:13.878 --> 00:53:17.000]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:23.382]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[00:53:23.502 --> 00:53:35.472]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[00:53:35.752 --> 00:53:40.136]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[00:53:40.336 --> 00:53:41.896]  And they're so easy to use.
[00:53:42.116 --> 00:53:44.037]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[00:53:44.317 --> 00:53:47.757]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[00:53:48.037 --> 00:53:51.218]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.
[00:53:51.578 --> 00:53:54.059]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:53:54.079 --> 00:53:55.319]  Or go to faketv.com.
[00:53:55.339 --> 00:53:55.959]  That's 877-532-5388.
[00:53:56.239 --> 00:53:56.739]  Or faketv.com.
[00:53:56.819 --> 00:53:57.339]  Fake TV.
[00:53:57.379 --> 00:53:58.559]  The burglar deterrent.
[00:54:09.899 --> 00:54:10.268]  Uh-huh.
[00:54:20.416 --> 00:54:21.836]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:21.876 --> 00:54:22.617]  I'm David Knight.
[00:54:22.677 --> 00:54:24.997]  Now, Alex is going to be joining us in the next hour.
[00:54:25.417 --> 00:54:26.778]  He's working on a breaking story.
[00:54:26.818 --> 00:54:32.819]  We also have a report from him about Obama being given a kill switch to the entire communications system.
[00:54:33.299 --> 00:54:36.140]  Now, look at the context of what's going on.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.861]  We've got the Homeland Security armed agents in a North Carolina community.
[00:54:41.641 --> 00:54:44.922]  Telling people that they just want them to know that they're there.
[00:54:45.302 --> 00:54:50.684]  Intimidating them with their presence, telling them, if you see something, you better say something.
[00:54:50.724 --> 00:54:51.864]  Well, I see something.
[00:54:52.084 --> 00:55:02.388]  I see Obama preparing to address the entire nation simultaneously, perhaps after a false flag, but even more importantly, I see Obama, by executive order,
[00:55:03.404 --> 00:55:07.045]  Affecting a gun ban, this time just on AK-47s.
[00:55:07.085 --> 00:55:08.145]  This is a trial balloon.
[00:55:08.205 --> 00:55:09.266]  What is he appealing to?
[00:55:09.346 --> 00:55:13.127]  He's appealing to his national emergency powers.
[00:55:13.187 --> 00:55:17.908]  He's saying there's some kind of a national emergency that requires him to ban AK-47s.
[00:55:18.268 --> 00:55:25.950]  Well, if he can ban AK-47s, he can ban any and all guns and ammunitions, claiming that it's a national emergency.
[00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:28.810]  Now, this is something that's been going on for a while.
[00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:37.792]  As Kurt Nemo points out in his article, American civilians have been buying as many AK-47s from Russian gun manufacturers as the Russian military and police combined.
[00:55:38.232 --> 00:55:43.013]  People were concerned that it was going to be banned, and they were called conspiracy theorists.
[00:55:43.033 --> 00:55:44.333]  They were called paranoid.
[00:55:44.673 --> 00:55:46.334]  Well, now we see what's happening.
[00:55:46.814 --> 00:55:48.474]  And I see something else that's going on.
[00:55:48.974 --> 00:55:53.435]  I see our government training to fight American citizens everywhere.
[00:55:54.875 --> 00:56:06.960]  For AP Hill in Virginia, I see them in Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and now we see them in this, what CNN calls, a doomsday Disneyland in Georgia, where they're training to fight black Americans.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.662]  That's right, we want to break people into different groups, pit them against each other, balkanize the country.
[00:56:13.022 --> 00:56:17.224]  That's why the administration is always hammering home this racism charge.
[00:56:17.704 --> 00:56:20.445]  Here's the rest of that report from Alex Jones and Joe Biggs.
[00:56:21.264 --> 00:56:25.626]  We're opening up all these centers for these illegal aliens, but we're not doing anything for homeless veterans.
[00:56:25.646 --> 00:56:30.808]  We're not doing anything for Americans in general who need the help of America.
[00:56:31.328 --> 00:56:32.149]  They're not doing anything.
[00:56:32.169 --> 00:56:37.731]  Well, look at how they're turning off the power plant, shipping our jobs overseas, devaluing the dollar.
[00:56:37.771 --> 00:56:39.032]  They are destroying this country.
[00:56:39.572 --> 00:56:41.333]  In closing, let's look at some of these patches, Joe.
[00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:44.331]  Alright, so some of the video right here you're going to see is pretty disturbing.
[00:56:44.931 --> 00:56:50.676]  Actual big army out here training to put people into FEMA camps, essentially.
[00:56:50.996 --> 00:56:57.161]  You will have them taking them into custody, detaining them, and handing them over to police to be held.
[00:56:57.841 --> 00:57:00.403]  So right here we have a 3rd Infantry Division patch.
[00:57:00.864 --> 00:57:04.726]  You'll also see a 1st Armored Division, which is out of El Paso, Texas.
[00:57:05.247 --> 00:57:07.729]  And then you'll see a 1st Cavalry Division patch as well.
[00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:11.451]  Helicopters coming in, soldiers.
[00:57:13.673 --> 00:57:14.654]  It looks fine and dandy.
[00:57:14.674 --> 00:57:16.315]  Then you got the Constantino wire right here.
[00:57:17.516 --> 00:57:28.705]  Soldier, white guy, actually fighting an African-American citizen, getting her, trying to detain her until the cops can come and put her in a camp.
[00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:30.626]  And there you go.
[00:57:31.507 --> 00:57:34.850]  This is what's happening right now in our backyard every day.
[00:57:36.075 --> 00:57:38.278]  And then as you watch longer, they're all black.
[00:57:38.318 --> 00:57:39.479]  Look, you got black guys right there.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.745]  Yeah, they're the only ones that flip over cars and go and riot, apparently.
[00:57:50.404 --> 00:57:51.405]  You said a burning car?
[00:57:51.865 --> 00:57:54.447]  These centers are popping up everywhere right now.
[00:57:54.967 --> 00:57:56.268]  The one that we saw in Virginia.
[00:57:56.688 --> 00:58:03.053]  There's the Marine Base one now that looks more like a rural, suburbia kind with the churches and all that as well.
[00:58:03.353 --> 00:58:04.233]  And now we have this.
[00:58:04.934 --> 00:58:06.375]  This is even more in-depth.
[00:58:06.435 --> 00:58:09.017]  This is completely mind-blowing.
[00:58:09.117 --> 00:58:16.261]  It gives me chills watching this to see the lengths they're going to, the training they have, that they're going through to bring this to our country on our streets.
[00:58:17.803 --> 00:58:20.045]  We're going to continue to follow this tomorrow on the radio, 11 a.m.
[00:58:20.065 --> 00:58:20.745]  to 2 p.m.
[00:58:20.785 --> 00:58:24.609]  Again, this is extended, expanded coverage here on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:26.310]  These are the times that trend.
[00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:28.012]  That's from last night's Nightly News.
[00:58:28.032 --> 00:58:31.115]  There's a special report that's put up by Alex Jones and Joe Biggs.
[00:58:31.315 --> 00:58:33.857]  Alex Jones is working on another breaking story right now.
[00:58:33.897 --> 00:58:35.238]  He's going to be with us in the next hour.
[00:58:35.959 --> 00:58:36.919]  And you know, it's interesting.
[00:58:36.959 --> 00:58:38.400]  Are they going to wake up?
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.822]  Are people who have been voting for Obama because they say he's a black president?
[00:58:41.842 --> 00:58:43.702]  We've seen a lot of criticism out of Chicago.
[00:58:44.143 --> 00:58:46.404]  Now we see that they're training to fight black people.
[00:58:46.784 --> 00:58:50.846]  And Joel Gilbert, who Alex Jones is going to be talking to, will have some interesting updates on that.
[00:58:50.906 --> 00:58:51.486]  Stay with us.
[00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:55.728]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.838 --> 00:59:05.942]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:59:05.962 --> 00:59:09.304]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:59:09.324 --> 00:59:11.005]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:59:11.065 --> 00:59:17.329]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:59:17.429 --> 00:59:23.313]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:59:23.473 --> 00:59:27.238]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:59:27.418 --> 00:59:30.342]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:59:30.502 --> 00:59:38.512]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:59:38.792 --> 00:59:40.834]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:59:40.894 --> 00:59:41.916]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:59:42.276 --> 00:59:51.040]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.681]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:58.203]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[01:00:15.782 --> 01:00:19.947]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.628 --> 01:00:21.409]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:23.091]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.752 --> 01:00:27.397]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:32.003]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.745 --> 01:00:37.285]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:37.365 --> 01:00:38.726]  I'm David Knight, live in the studio.
[01:00:39.306 --> 01:00:44.367]  We wanted to continue with just the very end of that special report that aired first last night on the Nightly News.
[01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:51.449]  And of course, if you're not a Prison Planet TV subscriber, you need to become one because it's something that allows you to stay abreast as to what's happening.
[01:00:51.529 --> 01:00:56.691]  It allows you to share this with up to 11 other friends and family at the same time.
[01:00:57.151 --> 01:00:59.392]  This is key information we're seeing yet again.
[01:01:00.592 --> 01:01:09.217]  More evidence that the government is training to fight American citizens, especially by breaking them into different demographic groups and pitting them against each other.
[01:01:09.477 --> 01:01:13.259]  That's one of the main concerns about this massive opening of the border.
[01:01:13.299 --> 01:01:20.944]  We know how this government likes to play the racism card, likes to balkanize the public, and there's no better example of that than this report.
[01:01:20.964 --> 01:01:26.127]  Let's finish up this report that we're running from Alex Jones and Joe Biggs from last night's Nightly News.
[01:01:27.557 --> 01:01:31.719]  This nightmare will come true if we don't wake up from it and say no.
[01:01:32.419 --> 01:01:33.760]  It's just that simple.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:37.261]  The good news is the military knows how illegal this is.
[01:01:37.721 --> 01:01:38.802]  Knows how bad it is.
[01:01:39.922 --> 01:01:41.983]  But can they get the word out?
[01:01:42.023 --> 01:01:42.824]  Can we get the word out?
[01:01:42.844 --> 01:01:43.584]  Can you get the word out?
[01:01:43.904 --> 01:01:45.545]  And what do we call this report tonight?
[01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:48.166]  Obama preparing martial law?
[01:01:50.347 --> 01:01:50.927]  Big Army?
[01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.428]  Regular Army?
[01:01:52.468 --> 01:01:54.449]  Or Army trains to take on black Americans?
[01:01:57.073 --> 01:01:59.495]  I mean, there's so many things in this story.
[01:02:00.576 --> 01:02:02.797]  Preparations for martial law goes into high gear.
[01:02:02.817 --> 01:02:06.260]  You know, breaking, video.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.462]  Because see, so much of this is headlines.
[01:02:09.482 --> 01:02:14.646]  And I share with you our knowledge, as viewers, of our frustrations.
[01:02:14.686 --> 01:02:19.550]  Because my problem is I underestimate how bad things are.
[01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:20.991]  I don't exaggerate most of the time.
[01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:32.135]  That's rare when we get it wrong and say that it's, you know, worse than it actually is.
[01:02:32.936 --> 01:02:34.897]  It's usually much worse than we even thought.
[01:02:34.978 --> 01:02:37.920]  So, I don't even know how to respond to this treason.
[01:02:38.381 --> 01:02:42.204]  Joe, in closing, what should we call this report tonight?
[01:02:42.585 --> 01:02:43.726]  There's so much going on right here.
[01:02:43.746 --> 01:02:46.228]  There's so much that it's hard to pinpoint one thing.
[01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.650]  It's just
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:56.027]  Well, you saw that clip earlier where they go, and we're just here to let you know we're here as federal police and to watch your neighbors.
[01:02:56.267 --> 01:02:57.568]  I mean, it's Twilight Zone.
[01:02:57.688 --> 01:02:59.310]  It's direct authoritarianism.
[01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:05.336]  Ladies and gentlemen, send this video that we'll later post on YouTube at InfoWars.com to your friends and family.
[01:03:05.376 --> 01:03:06.157]  Send it to Congress.
[01:03:06.577 --> 01:03:07.838]  Send it to other radio hosts.
[01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:11.541]  If Americans want any future, we better reverse this.
[01:03:11.582 --> 01:03:13.723]  This is not security, this is insecurity.
[01:03:14.104 --> 01:03:20.088]  This is being done so they can politically break this country's back and make us domesticated slaves.
[01:03:20.248 --> 01:03:22.590]  Bottom line, that's what this type of stuff is for.
[01:03:23.031 --> 01:03:24.332]  Well, that's it for this extended coverage.
[01:03:24.392 --> 01:03:25.693]  Great job to the incredible crew.
[01:03:25.993 --> 01:03:29.256]  Please continue to support us and your prayers until tomorrow.
[01:03:29.336 --> 01:03:30.457]  I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[01:03:33.639 --> 01:03:34.140]  It's U.S.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.245]  Army training to fight black Americans, and you can see the embedded video report there.
[01:03:39.305 --> 01:03:43.949]  Now, as we're talking, there is breaking news coming out of the Ukraine.
[01:03:44.189 --> 01:03:51.496]  We are now being told by Ukrainian government that it's the Russians that they believe shot down a military plane.
[01:03:51.556 --> 01:03:56.121]  This is, I'm not sure, this is not the same plane, though, talking about the passenger plane.
[01:03:56.141 --> 01:03:58.022]  There's also a Malaysian Airlines
[01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:09.008]  Boeing 777 that's been reportedly shot down over the Ukraine, over Donetsk, where fighting is going on between pro-Russians and between Ukrainian, the new government that's there.
[01:04:09.229 --> 01:04:11.310]  They say 295 people were on board.
[01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:12.991]  Everyone has died.
[01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:19.875]  This is the cost of the wars that the bankers and military industrial complex are starting.
[01:04:20.176 --> 01:04:29.702]  We should be very concerned as we see our government training to fight domestic unrest in this country when we see them manufacturing crisis after crisis after crisis.
[01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:37.248]  Not only are they supporting rebels in the Middle East, they're fomenting dissent on the Russian border, and they're opening up our borders.
[01:04:37.728 --> 01:04:40.289]  As well as the financial crisis that we're in.
[01:04:40.689 --> 01:04:44.010]  In all of these different areas, they are pulling everything together.
[01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:52.212]  And at the same time, Obama says, as a national emergency, he is asserting his power to ban AK-47s by executive order.
[01:04:55.273 --> 01:04:56.594]  Because it's a national emergency.
[01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:59.275]  He's the one creating national emergencies.
[01:04:59.555 --> 01:05:00.696]  He's creating the crisis.
[01:05:00.956 --> 01:05:05.519]  He's using it as an opportunity to do gun control by executive order.
[01:05:05.879 --> 01:05:08.280]  You need to be very afraid of what these people are doing.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.101]  We're going to be right back.
[01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:09.541]  Stay with us.
[01:05:09.761 --> 01:05:11.642]  I've always believed in nutrition and nerves.
[01:05:12.003 --> 01:05:19.607]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:05:20.027 --> 01:05:27.090]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:31.952]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that's good stuff.
[01:05:32.172 --> 01:05:42.375]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:05:42.796 --> 01:05:48.918]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:05:49.258 --> 01:05:51.520]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:55.503]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:05:55.664 --> 01:05:57.265]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:05:57.625 --> 01:06:01.548]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:08.715]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:15.769]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:06:15.989 --> 01:06:20.175]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:06:20.556 --> 01:06:25.122]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:06:25.522 --> 01:06:28.144]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:06:28.444 --> 01:06:33.627]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:06:33.887 --> 01:06:40.771]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:06:41.272 --> 01:06:45.054]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:06:45.414 --> 01:06:50.197]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:50.537 --> 01:06:51.378]  This is innovating.
[01:06:51.658 --> 01:06:58.946]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:06:59.127 --> 01:07:03.211]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:03.411 --> 01:07:08.617]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super Detox Special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:09.523 --> 01:07:10.685]  I can, like, taste dirt in it.
[01:07:10.785 --> 01:07:11.866]  God knows what's in there.
[01:07:12.127 --> 01:07:16.232]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:07:16.392 --> 01:07:22.300]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:23.441]  That one is better.
[01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:24.483]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:07:24.763 --> 01:07:26.125]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[01:07:26.305 --> 01:07:26.725]  It's good water.
[01:07:26.845 --> 01:07:32.649]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:07:32.889 --> 01:07:40.013]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[01:07:40.233 --> 01:07:42.755]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:07:42.955 --> 01:07:50.960]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.141]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:07:52.161 --> 01:07:53.181]  It's good water.
[01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:53.822]  Refreshing.
[01:07:53.842 --> 01:07:54.282]  It's good!

[01:08:12.597 --> 01:08:18.622]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:19.242 --> 01:08:22.225]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:33.928 --> 01:08:38.652]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Thursday, 17th day of July, 2014.
[01:08:39.793 --> 01:08:51.223]  You just heard David Knight in the first hour, traffic-copping some of the special reports we shot last night dealing with the bombshell.
[01:08:52.159 --> 01:09:12.211]  information that we've received from people in the local area, photos, video, you name it, confirmed by government documents and by the training center's own promotional videos, that regular army, the Indo-Paci-Common-Tatus, is training basically to target, well, black people.
[01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:18.915]  Because everyone in their video and other videos we have are black, in multiple training operations.
[01:09:20.834 --> 01:09:30.262]  Now again, they've had other training missions where they say the new terrorist are the domestic Tea Party, in training videos, and we made a big deal about that a few years ago because they were all white.
[01:09:32.503 --> 01:09:36.166]  And they said, basically in those manuals, that it's white people we're worried about.
[01:09:36.227 --> 01:09:42.432]  So, so, Jack Spratt could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean, between the two of them they licked the platter clean.
[01:09:42.852 --> 01:09:47.295]  But they always sell it like, we're going to target this group, we're going to target that group.
[01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.218]  But when you get down to the end of the road, they're targeting everybody.
[01:09:52.332 --> 01:10:12.584]  But under Rex 84, they use civil unrest, collapse the border, to bring in permanent martial law, suspension of the Constitution, but they will target, quote, inner-city minorities that are seen as poor and on welfare and who is believed will blow up and riot if their welfare checks don't come.
[01:10:12.604 --> 01:10:16.767]  You know, that's always been pushed and sold, and it's probably true to a certain extent.
[01:10:17.307 --> 01:10:21.810]  But again, then they create an economic climate so that that happens.
[01:10:23.973 --> 01:10:28.216]  And then the military is actually needed to come in, because things do break down.
[01:10:28.336 --> 01:10:33.660]  But the larger issue is, who triggered the crisis to begin with, to allow it to happen?
[01:10:36.062 --> 01:10:48.332]  The political class will not get away with this, if we have a debate about it right now, and show the fact that they opened the borders, they advertised to bring the illegals in.
[01:10:52.324 --> 01:10:55.085]  This is a staged provocation, a false flag.
[01:10:57.206 --> 01:10:58.807]  That's why we harp on that so much.
[01:10:59.407 --> 01:11:14.514]  Obviously, the big news, just breaking in the last 20 minutes or so, Ukraine adviser, Malaysian airline jet shot down by missile near Ukraine-Russia border, that's CBS News, and they're already trying to blame the Russians.
[01:11:15.766 --> 01:11:19.189]  Ukraine, Russian rocket may have downed military plane.
[01:11:19.789 --> 01:11:24.974]  CBS News, a Ukrainian military transport plane was shot down.
[01:11:26.975 --> 01:11:28.557]  But that was a separate...
[01:11:29.758 --> 01:11:30.238]  We're good to go.
[01:11:53.786 --> 01:12:01.349]  This is not the Malaysian flight that's been dominating news for six months or whatever it is that disappeared somewhere in the Pacific.
[01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.190]  Clearly a cover-up there.
[01:12:04.971 --> 01:12:07.752]  No, this is another Malaysian flight.
[01:12:09.813 --> 01:12:14.775]  This is getting very, very bizarre, very, very suspicious is all I can say.
[01:12:15.995 --> 01:12:18.216]  And it's too early to be able to speculate, but
[01:12:21.584 --> 01:12:31.673]  The FAA has now put out a worldwide alert to aircraft flying out of the United States and North America into the Caucasus, not just Ukraine, that entire area.
[01:12:33.214 --> 01:12:38.179]  FAA has warned airlines to avoid Crimea because of conflict.
[01:12:40.299 --> 01:12:41.440]  We need to go over what we know.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:53.791]  Ukrainian officials said a passenger plane carrying 295 people was shot down Thursday over a town in the east of the country and Malaysia Airlines tweeted that it had lost connection with one of its flights over Ukraine airspace.
[01:12:55.112 --> 01:12:57.875]  And again, the latest is they've confirmed it did indeed go down.
[01:12:57.895 --> 01:13:07.283]  A source told Interfax that the plane began to drop afterwards and was found burning on the ground on Ukrainian territory.
[01:13:09.946 --> 01:13:17.219]  The plane was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur before it went down according to Reuters.
[01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:24.790]  I think it's safe to say I'm not going to be getting on any Malaysian Airlines anytime soon.
[01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:25.891]  Very tragic.
[01:13:26.331 --> 01:13:42.985]  Malaysian airliner, again down in Ukraine with 295 aboard, a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777, that's a big one, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, 295 souls on board, crashed Thursday in Ukraine near the Russian border after reportedly being hit by a missile.
[01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:48.470]  Remember how our government gave 15,000 heat-seeking missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, to Al Qaeda?
[01:13:49.417 --> 01:13:52.858]  I'm not saying Al-Qaeda did this, but this is just a taste of things to come.
[01:13:53.559 --> 01:14:07.424]  According to an advisor to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, Malaysian Airlines confirmed on its Facebook page that Ukrainian air traffic control lost contact with flight MH17 about 30 miles from the Russian-Ukraine border.
[01:14:08.024 --> 01:14:10.445]  The airline said the plane was carrying 280 passengers and 15 crew members.
[01:14:14.855 --> 01:14:25.218]  Now, the Russians have moved in special ops, and they pretty much admitted that now, and are shooting down helicopters and Ukrainian military NATO aircraft.
[01:14:25.518 --> 01:14:26.138]  That's what they are.
[01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:33.600]  Russia said a few days ago they may start targeted strikes inside the country, after they were shelled.
[01:14:35.121 --> 01:14:36.421]  This could be Russia
[01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:45.073]  Basically engaged in friendly fire, or shooting innocents, collateral damage.
[01:14:46.174 --> 01:15:05.609]  But, knowing the false flag activities of the globalists, what they've been up to, the lies they've been putting out over there, I would lean towards the fact that this is right on the border with Russia, that Ukraine, or a NATO op, would shoot this down to create a new way to demonize Russia, and as a pretext to escalate the war there.
[01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:07.590]  So this is getting really serious.
[01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:09.372]  I don't know, at this point,
[01:15:10.498 --> 01:15:23.626]  But Russia's been trying to de-escalate things, while the West started this whole thing, don't forget that, and overthrew the elected government, has been destabilizing.
[01:15:23.926 --> 01:15:26.227]  Who's running Al-Qaeda and ISIS into the whole Middle East?
[01:15:26.687 --> 01:15:27.168]  Globalists!
[01:15:27.932 --> 01:15:28.992]  Who's shutting off our power plants?
[01:15:29.032 --> 01:15:29.453]  Globalists.
[01:15:29.473 --> 01:15:30.213]  Who's going after our guns?
[01:15:30.233 --> 01:15:30.673]  Globalists.
[01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.054]  Who's opening our borders?
[01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:32.514]  Globalists.
[01:15:32.534 --> 01:15:39.896]  I mean, Hurton Moore wrote an article two days ago where it's George Soros admitting he's behind the open border move and the illegals pouring in.
[01:15:40.257 --> 01:15:42.437]  Admitting he's behind Ukraine, saying, I did it.
[01:15:44.158 --> 01:15:45.298]  Which I think he's taking too much credit.
[01:15:45.339 --> 01:15:45.999]  He's a big part of it.
[01:15:47.119 --> 01:15:50.500]  Saying they're part of the Arab Spring and turning loose all these groups.
[01:15:51.181 --> 01:15:53.742]  I mean, on every front, George Soros.
[01:15:54.722 --> 01:15:56.743]  So I'm not lionizing or
[01:15:58.356 --> 01:16:03.583]  deifying pooty-poot, as Bush called him.
[01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:07.749]  I am simply pointing out that
[01:16:09.636 --> 01:16:15.201]  This is all very, very, very, very, very, very suspicious.
[01:16:15.881 --> 01:16:17.062]  And it's just par for the course.
[01:16:17.763 --> 01:16:27.751]  Malaysian Airliner down in Ukraine with 295 on board and the crew just put up on TV screen of your TV viewer more from the Malaysian Airlines Facebook with the new announcement.
[01:16:27.811 --> 01:16:31.014]  Perhaps we can put that back up and I can read from that.
[01:16:31.094 --> 01:16:35.878]  We'll continue to give you updates today as all of this unfolds.
[01:16:39.292 --> 01:16:44.416]  We do have Joel Gilbert coming on to talk about Obama's plan to wreck the country and a new film he has.
[01:16:45.617 --> 01:16:50.421]  And I'm tempted to move him, though, because there's so much news, but I think we'll just go ahead and follow through with the interview.
[01:16:50.441 --> 01:17:07.034]  Malaysian Airlines confirms it received notification from Ukrainian ATC that it had lost contact with flight MH17 at 1415 Greenwich Mean Time, or Imperial British Time, at 30 kilometers from
[01:17:08.302 --> 01:17:13.985]  Tomka Waypoint, approximately 50 kilometers from the Russian-Ukraine border.
[01:17:15.345 --> 01:17:17.726]  So that's pretty far inside Ukraine.
[01:17:18.147 --> 01:17:19.988]  Flight MH17 operated by Boeing 777.
[01:17:20.308 --> 01:17:25.390]  You know, I find it hard to believe that... Here's why I think it leans towards Ukraine and NATO.
[01:17:30.793 --> 01:17:35.195]  The Russians don't stand to gain
[01:17:37.498 --> 01:17:46.844]  Shooting down an aircraft like this in broad daylight, it will be blamed on them regardless.
[01:17:49.566 --> 01:17:57.492]  And I don't believe that the Russian military would mistake a giant passenger jet on a scheduled flight and shoot it down.
[01:18:00.654 --> 01:18:03.736]  And you notice Ukraine within, I've got the time stamp here,
[01:18:04.915 --> 01:18:08.037]  Within a minute or two of this breaking 30 minutes ago.
[01:18:08.858 --> 01:18:10.039]  Within a minute or two.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.282]  Within a minute or two.
[01:18:16.503 --> 01:18:20.606]  They had already come out and said they think it's Russia.
[01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:27.070]  And last time I checked, Russia is just saying they don't know.
[01:18:28.712 --> 01:18:32.094]  Boeing 777 traveling from Amsterdam with 295 on board.
[01:18:32.114 --> 01:18:33.435]  Malaysia Airlines lost.
[01:18:37.571 --> 01:18:38.432]  Connection with flight.
[01:18:38.492 --> 01:18:39.633]  Report man was flying.
[01:18:40.614 --> 01:18:46.639]  Report was flying 33,000 feet when hit by missile fired from B-U-K launcher.
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:49.122]  Crash 35 miles from Russian border.
[01:18:49.702 --> 01:18:51.184]  Body parts found scattered.
[01:18:51.224 --> 01:18:53.105]  Video, photos, updates.
[01:18:53.666 --> 01:18:54.947]  That's from DrudgeReport.com.
[01:18:55.267 --> 01:18:58.330]  We've got all the same links and updates on InfoWars.com.
[01:18:58.350 --> 01:19:00.092]  We're going to create a
[01:19:02.091 --> 01:19:09.093]  Ukraine passenger shoot down page on Infowars.com right now and put all these links in there as well.
[01:19:10.593 --> 01:19:14.834]  But it's been shot down and this will become a whole new distraction about the war.
[01:19:15.694 --> 01:19:19.435]  It'll be, you know, whoever's behind this deserves to be attacked.
[01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:21.736]  And of course our media will say it's the Russians.
[01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:29.298]  And now this will distract from the medical breakdown on the border.
[01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:33.336]  Gallup poll showing that illegals are the top problem, citizens say.
[01:19:33.356 --> 01:19:36.378]  National poll, the majority say send them home now.
[01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:40.539]  Report Obama vows to reduce deportations in the face of the people.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:46.942]  And Pelosi says, yeah, slow the deportations down even faster, and the feds are releasing children into unsafe homes.
[01:19:47.982 --> 01:19:53.065]  DHS parents give kids birth control in case they're raped along the way.
[01:19:56.678 --> 01:19:59.540]  Honduras seeks aid to just mini Marshall Plan.
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:04.043]  See, only a greater union of the Americas will fix this problem.
[01:20:04.063 --> 01:20:05.804]  That's what the globalists said years ago.
[01:20:05.824 --> 01:20:07.786]  That's what they're doing right now.
[01:20:09.992 --> 01:20:14.774]  It seems that everywhere you turn to these days, people are talking about the health benefits of silver.
[01:20:15.114 --> 01:20:17.795]  But don't be fooled into believing all silver is the same.
[01:20:18.256 --> 01:20:24.118]  Only one silver solution has been clinically shown to be hundreds of times stronger than colloidal or ionic silver.
[01:20:24.398 --> 01:20:26.159]  That's supernatural silver.
[01:20:26.599 --> 01:20:31.361]  It can be used internally as a powerful immune system enhancer to fight off bacteria and viruses.

[01:24:18.657 --> 01:24:25.742]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[01:24:25.802 --> 01:24:30.725]  George Strait was singing, seashores of old Mexico.
[01:24:33.327 --> 01:24:36.309]  It sounded so good, I got an idea.
[01:24:36.349 --> 01:24:40.052]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[01:24:40.072 --> 01:24:42.233]  Yes folks, we border Latin America.
[01:24:42.293 --> 01:24:46.056]  And we've got our reporters down in South Texas at that resort.
[01:24:47.345 --> 01:24:50.910]  Uh, that the media was talking about where they were going to store all the kids.
[01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:53.753]  And the website and the photos look like a great place.
[01:24:53.833 --> 01:24:59.079]  Well, our reporters got there last night and their reservation was cancelled.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:05.466]  And they said, we don't want media here talking about what's going on with this, quote, Baptist church.
[01:25:06.963 --> 01:25:20.033]  Charity that it turns out just is Baptist in name and is basically like a giant CPS child orphanage system and we've now got footage of the facility.
[01:25:20.093 --> 01:25:23.736]  It's got a lot of nice amenities, but it's not been upkept.
[01:25:24.995 --> 01:25:45.577]  So it is not as luxurious as press reports were saying, and there are people staying there, contractors and others, but it does have barbershops and thousand-dollar-a-day meeting rooms, but the facility has definitely seen its heyday.
[01:25:46.257 --> 01:25:50.880]  But I'll tell you one thing, it's a lot better than what the veterans are getting and what the troops stay in.
[01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:59.406]  And the larger issue is the 50 plus million dollar contract that the government was going to give this charity.
[01:25:59.586 --> 01:26:01.668]  And they've claimed that it's backing out now.
[01:26:02.148 --> 01:26:05.811]  That's a tactic we see, so a story goes away and then the contract comes back.
[01:26:06.371 --> 01:26:08.393]  And we're going to investigate this charity.
[01:26:08.893 --> 01:26:09.714]  We're looking into it.
[01:26:09.734 --> 01:26:11.715]  But man, it's the Baptist, it's the Catholic Church.
[01:26:12.596 --> 01:26:14.257]  It's basically, these are all businesses now.
[01:26:16.112 --> 01:26:18.714]  It's got hot tubs, swimming pools, you name it.
[01:26:20.415 --> 01:26:27.400]  Free luxury resort for illegals has 100,000 rooms, excuse me, $1,000 rooms for rent.
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:32.724]  Obama administration funds hotel for undocumented immigrants.
[01:26:34.685 --> 01:26:37.968]  Notice how even InfoWars use the quasi politically correct thing.
[01:26:39.249 --> 01:26:40.209]  Undocumented immigrants.
[01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:42.331]  First, it's illegal alien.
[01:26:44.244 --> 01:26:48.327]  Then it's undocumented worker, undocumented migrant.
[01:26:48.687 --> 01:26:52.109]  Now it's, don't even say migrant, just say unaccompanied child.
[01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:59.975]  Like when you were a kid and get put on Southwest Airlines to go see grandma and mama'd wave at you and daddy'd wave at you, get on the plane and fly down.
[01:27:00.595 --> 01:27:06.019]  The issue is they are advertising that people need to come to this country.
[01:27:06.719 --> 01:27:13.944]  And compared to Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Venezuela, and the rest of it,
[01:27:15.762 --> 01:27:23.287]  These are absolutely, totally, and completely nice facilities.
[01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:26.810]  And they're all getting healthcare.
[01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:30.392]  I just want to illustrate the preferential treatment and the discrimination.
[01:27:30.733 --> 01:27:32.134]  It's not even a reflection on these people.
[01:27:32.194 --> 01:27:32.814]  I don't blame them.
[01:27:33.134 --> 01:27:34.075]  They're being used as a pawn.
[01:27:34.155 --> 01:27:43.802]  But Joe Biggs in our office, combat veteran, blown up repeatedly in armored vehicles, shrapnel shot all of it.
[01:27:45.889 --> 01:27:56.015]  Literally has to end up going and paying for his own health care at the hospital because he coughs up blood from being inside a burning vehicle.
[01:27:58.196 --> 01:28:09.222]  That other veteran we had in there whose, I forget his name, his arm blown off, face pretty much blown away, Mario Lopez, he coughs up blood.
[01:28:09.282 --> 01:28:10.883]  It burned his insides as well.
[01:28:17.475 --> 01:28:22.239]  I mean, I've been... I don't like with Joe Biggs.
[01:28:22.259 --> 01:28:23.500]  I mean, I've seen him with his shirt off.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.501]  And he's got holes all over him.
[01:28:25.861 --> 01:28:27.483]  And the whole point is he cannot get in.
[01:28:27.503 --> 01:28:30.825]  And they get there and they look at him and they go, OK, we're set to have another meeting two weeks from now.
[01:28:31.445 --> 01:28:34.708]  And he comes in a few weeks later, they go, all right, I'll come back, you have another meeting.
[01:28:36.389 --> 01:28:38.891]  He's on a death panel list, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:40.692 --> 01:28:41.413]  Do you understand?
[01:28:41.553 --> 01:28:42.253]  It's on purpose.
[01:28:42.474 --> 01:28:44.055]  They got a brand new facility, plenty of people.
[01:28:44.315 --> 01:28:45.576]  He's not getting the health care.
[01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:54.634]  Now, if you fit the right psych profile, and you play along with the system, and you were some desk jockey, and they're not scared of you, you get great health care.
[01:28:55.795 --> 01:28:57.796]  But you're a combat vet, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:04.960]  Unless you're getting part of some wounded warrior program, and you get separate health care, you're not getting jack squat.
[01:29:07.922 --> 01:29:13.665]  I know with Lopez, he said it was some private groups and others that helped him get, you know, his robotic arm and the rest of it.
[01:29:14.605 --> 01:29:15.286]  A robot arm.
[01:29:17.338 --> 01:29:20.999]  And it just shows how much they hate veterans, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:21.659 --> 01:29:25.060]  The criminals that have hijacked this government.
[01:29:26.801 --> 01:29:31.422]  There it is, after five years of captivity, Bo Bergdahl to start work at Army Post.
[01:29:32.502 --> 01:29:34.043]  Bo's just fine now.
[01:29:34.063 --> 01:29:39.284]  He'd buy any of this.
[01:29:41.845 --> 01:29:42.405]  We'll be back.
[01:29:44.033 --> 01:29:54.540]  With Obama's purposeful plan with the globalists to bankrupt this country, to break our will, and teach us to beg for government cheese, like former Soviet citizens had to do in the past.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:58.002]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:59.023 --> 01:29:59.923]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.423 --> 01:30:02.025]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.945 --> 01:30:05.647]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.365 --> 01:30:13.106]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:30:13.647 --> 01:30:20.611]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:30:21.072 --> 01:30:31.458]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:30:31.899 --> 01:30:41.125]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:30:41.865 --> 01:30:45.288]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:30:45.929 --> 01:30:49.352]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:30:49.692 --> 01:30:51.274]  Experience the new formula.
[01:30:51.734 --> 01:30:53.736]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:30:54.316 --> 01:30:55.337]  Shield your family.
[01:30:55.657 --> 01:30:57.058]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:31:35.486 --> 01:31:37.567]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[01:31:37.747 --> 01:31:40.668]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[01:31:40.868 --> 01:31:46.672]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free.

[01:32:03.123 --> 01:32:04.284]  Molon Labe.
[01:32:04.564 --> 01:32:08.187]  You can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[01:32:09.898 --> 01:32:14.640]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:17.981]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[01:32:18.221 --> 01:32:20.062]  She's just not the woman I married.
[01:32:20.322 --> 01:32:22.242]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:32:22.482 --> 01:32:23.943]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:32:24.123 --> 01:32:27.164]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:32:27.464 --> 01:32:28.785]  If so, consider this.
[01:32:29.045 --> 01:32:37.968]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:32:38.328 --> 01:32:44.350]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[01:32:44.710 --> 01:32:46.330]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:46.751 --> 01:32:54.353]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[01:33:03.504 --> 01:33:04.125]  Live Life Healthy!
[01:33:27.794 --> 01:33:35.678]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:35.858 --> 01:33:39.079]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:42.000]  It's time to knock them dead in the Info War, folks.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:45.362]  It's time to belly up for the enemy.
[01:33:46.842 --> 01:33:50.264]  Believe me, the battle for the Republic is happening right now.
[01:33:50.304 --> 01:33:53.685]  The battle for the world is happening right now.
[01:33:54.186 --> 01:33:54.766]  Joel Gilbert.
[01:33:57.128 --> 01:33:59.390]  Best-selling documentary filmmaker, works with WorldNetDaily.
[01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:01.011]  He's going to be joining us here to talk about his new film.
[01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:13.040]  In just a moment, in fact, we're going to play a clip from the film and then go right to our guest to cover his nationwide investigation into the purposeful plan to wreck the country, domesticate the public.
[01:34:14.001 --> 01:34:16.102]  And his film couldn't be more timely right now.
[01:34:17.031 --> 01:34:21.294]  Because it shows all the people that believed in Obama that got screwed over.
[01:34:21.795 --> 01:34:27.239]  Now you see the black residents of Chicago and black residents of other areas just where everything's falling apart.
[01:34:27.779 --> 01:34:30.181]  They're getting, you know, even kicked off their subsidies and everything.
[01:34:30.722 --> 01:34:32.363]  Wondering why the border's wide open.
[01:34:32.403 --> 01:34:35.765]  Because the plan is to collapse the country.
[01:34:36.026 --> 01:34:37.647]  Let's go to a clip from his new film.
[01:34:37.907 --> 01:34:40.752]  Peggy Joseph took her daughter out of school early Wednesday.
[01:34:41.233 --> 01:34:44.078]  Her emotions ran high following Obama's speech.
[01:34:44.639 --> 01:34:46.363]  I won't have to worry about putting gas in my car.
[01:34:46.423 --> 01:34:47.705]  I won't have to worry about paying my mortgage.
[01:34:54.389 --> 01:34:54.709]  Hi.
[01:34:54.809 --> 01:34:55.089]  Hi.
[01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:56.570]  Are you Peggy Joseph?
[01:34:56.970 --> 01:34:58.250]  Yes, I am.
[01:34:58.971 --> 01:34:59.751]  I have a present for you.
[01:34:59.791 --> 01:35:01.192]  I brought you some ruby slippers.
[01:35:03.212 --> 01:35:03.893]  Slippers?
[01:35:04.053 --> 01:35:04.413]  Yes.
[01:35:04.513 --> 01:35:05.893]  I didn't order any slippers.
[01:35:05.953 --> 01:35:06.233]  I know.
[01:35:06.313 --> 01:35:07.714]  Well, I'm making a documentary.
[01:35:07.734 --> 01:35:08.934]  I'd like to talk to you.
[01:35:08.954 --> 01:35:09.395]  Do you mind?
[01:35:09.415 --> 01:35:11.355]  I won't have to worry about putting gas in my car.
[01:35:11.415 --> 01:35:13.016]  I won't have to worry about paying my mortgage.
[01:35:13.536 --> 01:35:15.877]  Did Obama pay for your mortgage?
[01:35:16.758 --> 01:35:18.059]  And did he pay for your gas?
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.140]  Absolutely not.
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:23.642]  Mortgage got worse and gas prices got higher.
[01:35:24.183 --> 01:35:25.824]  During that time, we needed a change.
[01:35:26.184 --> 01:35:28.105]  But a change for the better, not for the worse.
[01:35:28.665 --> 01:35:29.686]  He had a very big voice.
[01:35:30.246 --> 01:35:31.247]  Just like the Wizard of Oz.
[01:35:32.682 --> 01:35:34.806]  It wasn't with this little teeny, teeny, tiny man.
[01:35:35.266 --> 01:35:36.749]  And I think it's the same thing with Obama.
[01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:38.311]  Man behind the curtain.
[01:35:39.353 --> 01:35:41.737]  Not who we thought or expected him to be.
[01:35:41.757 --> 01:35:44.882]  I was Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
[01:35:46.601 --> 01:35:47.541]  That's how I feel.
[01:35:47.701 --> 01:35:48.542]  I was Dorothy.
[01:35:49.102 --> 01:35:52.863]  I started getting more educated about politics and reading more.
[01:35:53.403 --> 01:35:55.463]  What I learned is never trust the wizard.
[01:35:55.823 --> 01:36:04.406]  It's within ourselves to have the determination, the courage, and the brains to bring us to our destiny.
[01:36:04.946 --> 01:36:07.126]  Is America still the land of opportunity?
[01:36:07.826 --> 01:36:07.126]  100%.
[01:36:09.147 --> 01:36:09.427]  It is.
[01:36:09.927 --> 01:36:13.248]  Anything that you want to do or become, you can do it in America.
[01:36:17.858 --> 01:36:27.828]  No Place Like Utopia is the new film, and if it sells out in the first few cities it opens in, it'll get picked up nationwide like America.
[01:36:29.823 --> 01:36:30.984]  2016 and others have done.
[01:36:31.044 --> 01:36:42.575]  It was great to go to the movies last week and be able to have multiple choices at major theaters to go see America, which is not perfect, but certainly has some good aspects to it.
[01:36:43.396 --> 01:36:48.661]  It's like cyanide to these tyrants, but Joel Gilbert's film is going to be even more powerful.
[01:36:48.681 --> 01:36:49.982]  There's no place like Utopia.
[01:36:51.043 --> 01:36:53.163]  And it's now being released first in Denver.
[01:36:53.544 --> 01:36:59.925]  So he joins us here, and I have no financial stake in the film, but when it comes out on DVD, I intend to carry it, at infowarestore.com.
[01:37:00.465 --> 01:37:05.366]  I try to promote the Veritas Project and other people.
[01:37:05.506 --> 01:37:06.866]  I mean, we're just in this together.
[01:37:08.646 --> 01:37:11.307]  They're trying to, they have arrested James O'Keefe before.
[01:37:11.607 --> 01:37:13.047]  They have arrested Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:37:13.707 --> 01:37:15.928]  I've got all sorts of dirty tricks going against me right now.
[01:37:17.181 --> 01:37:19.162]  Which only lets us know we're going to fight that much harder.
[01:37:19.202 --> 01:37:20.703]  We've never exploded faster.
[01:37:22.443 --> 01:37:28.866]  It's because we're effective and because we're starting to set the real agenda to get us out of this mess that they're coming after us.
[01:37:28.946 --> 01:37:30.786]  So that's why we got Joel Gilbert on.
[01:37:31.106 --> 01:37:43.591]  He of course made dreams of my real father that I believe overwhelmingly puts on a stunning, stunningly convincing case that would convince a jury of who Obama's father really was.
[01:37:43.631 --> 01:37:45.692]  And he isn't from Kenya, folks.
[01:37:46.673 --> 01:37:47.574]  He isn't from Kenya.
[01:37:50.315 --> 01:37:59.661]  He looks just like the man who he would stay with in the summers, that his grandfather hung out with and was best buddies with, who was a famous communist and pornographer.
[01:37:59.681 --> 01:38:06.305]  There's photos of him and a woman that is the spitting image of Obama's wife, I mean Obama's mother.
[01:38:06.325 --> 01:38:08.586]  And I'm not going to go back through that.
[01:38:08.626 --> 01:38:11.868]  We sell that film, Raymond's My Real Father, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:38:11.888 --> 01:38:12.669]  Then you know why.
[01:38:14.275 --> 01:38:16.716]  In Harvard Law Review, he said he was from Kenya.
[01:38:18.036 --> 01:38:22.238]  And why in his book review, Prospectus, he said he was from Kenya.
[01:38:22.278 --> 01:38:24.978]  And why his wife, in multiple speeches, said he was from Kenya.
[01:38:25.439 --> 01:38:29.400]  And why they did that whole thing, putting out a bad birth certificate, that was such an obvious fake.
[01:38:31.901 --> 01:38:42.644]  They did all of that as an elaborate, that's exactly how the CIA operates, to act like, oh no, you found me out, and then cover this up, when really, it's because we know who his real daddy was.
[01:38:44.344 --> 01:38:46.085]  Unbelievable, and I want to get an update on that.
[01:38:46.445 --> 01:38:50.587]  But joelgilbert.net, Joel Gilbert is here with us today.
[01:38:51.348 --> 01:38:55.250]  Joel, I want to talk some about the film because it couldn't be more timely.
[01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:58.231]  Tell us where it's opening and break down the film for us.
[01:38:58.271 --> 01:38:59.152]  I can't wait to see it.
[01:38:59.172 --> 01:39:00.472]  I've only seen excerpts.
[01:39:00.973 --> 01:39:05.975]  And then expanding on that, I want to talk about the waterfront with you because you're a smart guy.
[01:39:05.995 --> 01:39:07.736]  I've had your finger on the pulse.
[01:39:07.816 --> 01:39:12.979]  It looks like the progressive tyrants, the totalitarians, who aren't liberal in my view,
[01:39:13.803 --> 01:39:16.284]  I mean, Thomas Jefferson was a liberal, that's my saying, because he was.
[01:39:16.824 --> 01:39:17.424]  That's a liberal.
[01:39:17.925 --> 01:39:18.825]  These people are not liberals.
[01:39:19.305 --> 01:39:23.907]  You could call kind of George Washington a conservative, and you would call Thomas Jefferson a liberal of that age.
[01:39:24.347 --> 01:39:25.447]  That's how they were seen at the time.
[01:39:25.828 --> 01:39:34.691]  Totally different labels now, but I don't believe, I know they're going for broke right now, and you can see on every front, so I want you to speak to that.
[01:39:35.467 --> 01:39:40.951]  Okay, well, first of all, they're not liberal about anything except sex, drugs, and other people's money.
[01:39:41.391 --> 01:39:45.774]  Other than that, they're the most intolerant people that you could ever meet.
[01:39:46.535 --> 01:39:47.876]  My film does open in Denver.
[01:39:47.896 --> 01:39:49.457]  There's no place like Utopia.
[01:39:49.997 --> 01:39:51.899]  And it's kind of a play on The Wizard of Oz.
[01:39:51.979 --> 01:39:53.600]  Dorothy, there's no place like home.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:03.467]  The idea of a socialist utopia, paradise on earth, is what binds together the ideology of Marxism and communism and progressivism
[01:40:04.247 --> 01:40:07.830]  They say everything is step-by-step toward this perfect future.
[01:40:08.271 --> 01:40:21.242]  But we know in history, and we show this in the film, there's no place like Utopia, that every time a tyrant said, I'm the God on Earth, Mao, Stalin, Lenin, Castro, follow me down this yellow brick road and I'm gonna take you to paradise.
[01:40:21.763 --> 01:40:28.128]  Well, when they got to the Emerald City, when they got to paradise, Castro, Lenin, Mao sent them to the
[01:40:28.829 --> 01:40:38.638]  Dungeons, gulags, collective farms, where they starved them to death and killed them trying to force them to fit into this perfect utopia.
[01:40:39.279 --> 01:40:48.027]  Utopians murdered 100 million people in peacetime in the 20th century to force humanity into their socialist paradise.
[01:40:48.647 --> 01:40:51.730]  Unfortunately, I show this in my film, what we're seeing today is a
[01:40:52.691 --> 01:40:55.212]  A repeat of this God on Earth.
[01:40:55.312 --> 01:41:00.094]  Obama is going to be the leader and take everybody down this path, down the yellow brick road.
[01:41:00.914 --> 01:41:04.555]  We know what's happened in the last 30 years, and I go over this in the film.
[01:41:05.235 --> 01:41:09.517]  The Democrat Party has been taken over by the radical socialists.
[01:41:09.617 --> 01:41:18.480]  Obama's friends like Bill Ayers, in the late 60s, they said things like, let's destroy America, let's replace the Constitution with the Communist Manifesto.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:20.962]  Now, that failed because it was evil.
[01:41:21.082 --> 01:41:22.383]  Nobody wanted to do that.
[01:41:22.804 --> 01:41:26.667]  Those guys ended up going to jail for murdering policemen and went underground.
[01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:31.392]  When they came out in the early 80s, they realized, let's just change our rhetoric.
[01:41:31.492 --> 01:41:36.397]  Instead of saying we want to destroy America, let's just say we want to help middle class families.
[01:41:36.617 --> 01:41:37.417]  Let's say we want to
[01:41:38.118 --> 01:41:39.260]  Raise the minimum wage.
[01:41:39.881 --> 01:41:46.049]  So these radicals took over the Democrat Party, and today the Democrat Party is a radical socialist party.
[01:41:46.489 --> 01:41:47.791]  Their agenda is the same.
[01:41:48.232 --> 01:41:54.099]  They just have different rhetoric and a different face, which is Barack Obama, who seems like a friendly guy.
[01:41:54.958 --> 01:41:59.362]  But as you alluded to in my last film, he's really a red diaper baby.
[01:41:59.422 --> 01:42:11.012]  He's the child of a Communist Party member, and he was radicalized in his youth and spent his entire life journey in this little-known world of American Marxism, and today he's in the White House
[01:42:11.793 --> 01:42:13.655]  Agitating, just like he did in Chicago.
[01:42:13.715 --> 01:42:15.697]  He was a professional agitator.
[01:42:16.018 --> 01:42:20.863]  They use the word organizer because it sounds nicer, but he was a community agitator.
[01:42:21.324 --> 01:42:29.152]  The ideology is let's rub salt in the wounds of minorities and use their discontent to take power and then discard them.
[01:42:29.793 --> 01:42:33.116]  Then he was to the White House where he's continuing to agitate.
[01:42:33.877 --> 01:42:49.415]  I met all these people, I go to Chicago, Southside Chicago, Detroit, Denver, Newark, and I talk to these people that have been living in these progressive cities for 50, 60 years, and it turns out they realize nobody's progressing, they're all regressing.
[01:42:49.815 --> 01:42:53.960]  60% unemployment, drug culture, violence, schools are closed.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:02.624]  So what's happening is they're bringing these failed policies that they destroyed our great cities with to Washington so they can impose it on the rest of the country.
[01:43:03.044 --> 01:43:04.525]  And in there's no place like Utopia.
[01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:11.869]  I put the whole story together so you can understand what the Obama of Oz is really up to and where the ideology comes from.
[01:43:12.492 --> 01:43:18.055]  And by the way, Joel, I never got it completed, and then now it's an old film, so I'm making a whole new one.
[01:43:18.075 --> 01:43:22.338]  Obama Deception 2 is basically the film you're making.
[01:43:22.398 --> 01:43:23.298]  I'm glad yours got out.
[01:43:23.558 --> 01:43:26.280]  And it's not that I knew what you were doing, or you knew what I was doing.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.240]  It's the truth.
[01:43:27.741 --> 01:43:31.463]  We're sitting there looking at it, and again, there's this globalist ideology above it.
[01:43:32.185 --> 01:43:37.870]  But it's clearly using classic communist tactics down the line.
[01:43:38.370 --> 01:43:42.273]  And now that we see Obama in collapsing the borders, shutting down the power plants.
[01:43:42.574 --> 01:43:46.677]  I mean, I make a big deal out of that because it's already doubled energy prices in six years for electricity.
[01:43:46.697 --> 01:43:47.978]  I mean, this is crippling people.
[01:43:48.258 --> 01:43:51.201]  If they hadn't done that alone, we wouldn't be in this depression.
[01:43:52.132 --> 01:43:55.696]  And so your film, from what you're saying, is so spot on.
[01:43:55.716 --> 01:43:57.958]  Your last film was so powerful.
[01:43:58.379 --> 01:44:04.525]  We need everyone to... Which sites should they go to to learn about times and listings?
[01:44:05.186 --> 01:44:07.629]  And how do folks make sure they can get this shown in their city?
[01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:27.139]  Okay, well first you can see the trailer and other information at theresnoplacelikeutopia.com and we have a theaters link that you can click on and you can say please bring theresnoplacelikeutopia to my city and when we expand we send those out all over the country to the theater owners and that helps quite a bit.
[01:44:27.479 --> 01:44:30.100]  But we're opening in Denver this weekend five times a day.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:30.761]  I'm going to be there.
[01:44:31.481 --> 01:44:34.142]  And you can buy advance tickets on Fandango.
[01:44:34.563 --> 01:44:48.069]  If you know anybody in Denver, tell them to cancel their plans this weekend and please come out because if we do well this weekend, we're going to go nationwide and reveal the entire lie of progressivism in a way that everybody can understand.
[01:44:48.429 --> 01:44:52.351]  It's also, I call it humorous and horrifying because the movie is a lot of fun.
[01:44:52.872 --> 01:44:56.533]  It rocks with music, but it shows and reveals... Oh yeah, the trailer.
[01:44:56.593 --> 01:44:57.434]  The trailer is incredible.
[01:44:57.714 --> 01:44:59.954]  And again, I'll use a cheesy Star Wars analogy here.
[01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:09.316]  We got 30 X-Wings going into the trench here, and a lot of films have been made, but we don't know which photon torpedo is going to go down the shaft and blow it up.
[01:45:09.776 --> 01:45:17.438]  I've got a feeling about this film, it could be the one that, just like Uncle Tom's cabin or the jungle, changed things societally.
[01:45:17.958 --> 01:45:23.539]  Resistance is victory, because we don't know which punch, which uppercut, is going to land and break the jaw.
[01:45:23.959 --> 01:45:25.399]  And we've already landed a lot of blows.
[01:45:25.959 --> 01:45:28.042]  You know, in the fight getting the truth out.
[01:45:28.343 --> 01:45:31.066]  But we've got to hammer them and hammer them hard.
[01:45:31.387 --> 01:45:34.271]  Because I've got to be honest, I'm rarely wrong about things, Joel.
[01:45:35.729 --> 01:45:43.773]  I know the globalists and know how they're rich and powerful and enjoy wealth, and I just kind of thought of communism as some old bygone era failed thing.
[01:45:44.093 --> 01:46:02.921]  I mean, I knew a lot of financial lenders like Armand Hammer and George Soros and people that funded it and used it to control populations of countries they're not in, but to imagine that the elite in this country would actually put a communist in, that they would actually try to create a race war, that they would actually do all this with such a classic Soviet
[01:46:03.861 --> 01:46:04.321]  I don't know.
[01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:25.935]  And they really do plan to use Homeland Security on Patriots?
[01:46:25.955 --> 01:46:27.218]  They really plan to round us up?
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.745]  Like Larry Grafwald exposed with the Weathermen?
[01:46:31.046 --> 01:46:32.669]  I mean, they're that savage?
[01:46:33.451 --> 01:46:33.591]  And...
[01:46:35.290 --> 01:46:36.491]  I mean, how do we stop them?
[01:46:36.511 --> 01:46:38.392]  I guess your film and shows like this.
[01:46:38.853 --> 01:46:41.695]  Well, in the early 60s they used Hollywood.
[01:46:41.735 --> 01:46:52.543]  John Wayne, Ronald Reagan all made commercials and movies explaining, you see these radicals on campus who are worshiping Chairman Mao, like Bill Ayers.
[01:46:52.563 --> 01:46:53.384]  He was a Maoist.
[01:46:53.904 --> 01:46:55.486]  Let's tell you who Mao really is.
[01:46:55.986 --> 01:46:59.609]  He is a psychopathic communist who locked
[01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:05.395]  50 million people in collective farms, where 50 million people starve to death.
[01:47:05.815 --> 01:47:07.918]  And they explain that there is no God on Earth.
[01:47:08.238 --> 01:47:09.720]  There is no paradise on Earth.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:13.364]  The closest we have to paradise is Kansas.
[01:47:13.564 --> 01:47:14.785]  This is as good as it gets.
[01:47:15.386 --> 01:47:19.911]  Whenever in history somebody says, I got the perfect formula for social change.
[01:47:20.231 --> 01:47:21.332]  We're going to change everything.
[01:47:21.392 --> 01:47:21.853]  Follow me.
[01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:28.372]  Whenever you hear that, you have to ask yourself, what stripes are my uniform going to be this time?
[01:47:28.772 --> 01:47:29.272]  Exactly.
[01:47:29.413 --> 01:47:30.533]  You're going to prison.
[01:47:31.393 --> 01:47:40.237]  The endgame of socialism is prison camp, because they cannot force people to fit into their paradise unless they kill about half of them.
[01:47:40.757 --> 01:47:42.898]  They killed a hundred million people in peacetime.
[01:47:43.758 --> 01:47:45.019]  All over the 20th century.
[01:47:45.059 --> 01:47:45.599]  More than that.
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:46.660]  More than that.
[01:47:47.301 --> 01:48:01.911]  But the political repression, the ideology of creating a big lower class and eliminating the middle class so the political elites can control the wealth is the ideology of Barack Obama and it is the ideology of the Democrat Party today.
[01:48:02.051 --> 01:48:06.374]  And America is the perfect place for this to happen because we've never had something this big.
[01:48:07.134 --> 01:48:11.716]  I mean, we didn't go through what the Chinese and the Russians and the Cubans and everybody have gone through.
[01:48:12.416 --> 01:48:14.517]  We have no idea what we're facing.
[01:48:14.997 --> 01:48:17.158]  I mean, I didn't have an idea.
[01:48:17.658 --> 01:48:20.979]  And people think I'm radical and, you know, think things are worse than they are.
[01:48:20.999 --> 01:48:21.239]  No, no, no.
[01:48:21.619 --> 01:48:28.782]  I've been blindsided by how real this is, how much they hate this country, how much they hate freedom, how nasty they are.
[01:48:28.802 --> 01:48:30.082]  I mean, they run the country.
[01:48:30.122 --> 01:48:30.762]  They took over.
[01:48:31.083 --> 01:48:32.043]  Why do they want to wreck it?
[01:48:33.306 --> 01:48:44.279]  Their twisted ideology still is that they're comparing America to a socialist utopia, to a paradise on earth, not to other countries.
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:49.205]  So when they compare America to utopia, of course they hate it, everything's wrong.
[01:48:49.565 --> 01:48:53.090]  If you compare America to the rest of the world, this is paradise on earth.
[01:48:53.930 --> 01:49:03.378]  But this ideology is born of the Marxism, the communism, the idea of going down the yellow brick road, and this magical wizard will solve your problems.
[01:49:03.818 --> 01:49:20.392]  We know, and you saw Peggy Joseph in my movie, she also found out Obama's just a man behind the curtain, and their agenda is certainly to break down and destroy the American middle class, and everything they do is meant to divide and agitate us, and not bring us together.
[01:49:20.572 --> 01:49:21.452]  And it really is!
[01:49:21.512 --> 01:49:31.635]  I mean, they really are passing seven taxes in Obamacare on poor people, and he sits there holding their hand and being sweet to them, while they know full well they want to wreck them.
[01:49:32.135 --> 01:49:34.756]  I mean, it is just so vicious.
[01:49:34.776 --> 01:49:42.278]  I mean, when I stand in a Luby's cafeteria line, and I see old ladies, I've been eating there since I was a kid, who can't afford a Lou Anne platter now.
[01:49:43.658 --> 01:49:48.200]  That's where King of the Hills, you know, Hank Hill's wife's name comes from, by the way, folks on the left side.
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:53.082]  Stuff from Mike Judge, or niece, you know, Lou Anne.
[01:49:53.102 --> 01:49:57.804]  I mean, I stand on those lines now, and nobody can afford the food, even though it's cheap.
[01:49:58.704 --> 01:50:01.085]  And I mean, it makes me mad to see people poor.
[01:50:01.385 --> 01:50:02.585]  These progressives love it.
[01:50:02.865 --> 01:50:04.026]  Why do they love it, Joel Gilbert?
[01:50:04.486 --> 01:50:09.493]  They love it because they need chaos in order to justify radical change.
[01:50:09.533 --> 01:50:19.326]  If everything is going well, if you can do like Michelle Obama and you can go from South Side Chicago and go to Princeton and go to Harvard and get a law degree and get a job making $300,000 a year like Michelle Obama,
[01:50:21.509 --> 01:50:23.951]  There's no reason for radical change, everything's fine.
[01:50:24.511 --> 01:50:28.954]  But they have to tell you that you've lost control and lose control of the border.
[01:50:28.994 --> 01:50:37.580]  That's why in my film I show Michelle Obama saying, you can't buy food, you can't pay your mortgage, you can't take care of your kids, not in America.
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:44.725]  They have to create chaos and make you think that life is out of control to justify giving them the power.
[01:50:45.265 --> 01:50:46.486]  That's the evil ideology.
[01:50:46.506 --> 01:50:48.627]  And then they screw it up more, and then they say give us more power.
[01:50:48.647 --> 01:50:48.807]  Exactly.
[01:50:49.288 --> 01:50:51.009]  And then they screw it up more, give us more power.
[01:50:51.553 --> 01:50:52.968]  Until we're under Stalin or Mao.
[01:50:54.946 --> 01:50:56.207]  And they're building the camps and everything.
[01:50:56.287 --> 01:50:57.688]  It's all just happening.
[01:50:58.108 --> 01:50:58.909]  Repeat of history.
[01:50:59.329 --> 01:51:02.931]  Joel Gilbert, powerful guest, filmmaker, straight ahead with the director.
[01:51:03.512 --> 01:51:09.316]  And then we've got more guests coming up today, ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Peter Glitzman, breaking information.

[01:53:02.285 --> 01:53:07.328]  Moe Enlabe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[01:53:08.718 --> 01:53:11.299]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:53:11.439 --> 01:53:15.420]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.

[01:54:14.304 --> 01:54:19.747]  Folks, you need to get into the theaters and see this new film that's been produced by Joel Gilbert.
[01:54:19.827 --> 01:54:24.669]  It is so important to see there's no place like Utopia.
[01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:28.531]  And to support Free Independent Media, there's a reason they're trying to shut this stuff down.
[01:54:29.131 --> 01:54:30.912]  Also in the month of July, support InfoWars.
[01:54:30.932 --> 01:54:32.273]  Spread the word about the broadcast.

[01:54:44.403 --> 01:54:47.165]  That comes out to like a penny a day per person.
[01:54:47.225 --> 01:54:53.210]  It just pays for the bandwidth and all of our books and films and more at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:55.572]  Some of the headlines up on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:56.092 --> 01:55:01.936]  Pervert gets his kicks by dressing up as a TSA screener and groping women at San Francisco Airport.
[01:55:02.256 --> 01:55:04.838]  Victims didn't even realize drunk man was an imposter.
[01:55:05.498 --> 01:55:07.320]  They're all an imposter, a power grab.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:10.642]  Strobe Talbot blames Russia for shooting down commercial airliner.
[01:55:11.202 --> 01:55:14.925]  Malaysian passenger airliner shot down near Russian border in Ukraine.
[01:55:15.485 --> 01:55:17.726]  Obama attacks Second Amendment with a new executive order.
[01:55:17.746 --> 01:55:18.507]  We'll tell you about that.
[01:55:19.047 --> 01:55:19.328]  U.S.
[01:55:19.408 --> 01:55:21.249]  Army training to fight black Americans.
[01:55:21.289 --> 01:55:23.710]  That's in these drills that we have the video of.
[01:55:24.051 --> 01:55:24.671]  And they admit it.
[01:55:25.051 --> 01:55:26.012]  It's nothing but black people.
[01:55:27.152 --> 01:55:27.773]  What's the plan?
[01:55:27.793 --> 01:55:31.154]  I guess in Chicago to turn the welfare checks off and then Obama saves the day?
[01:55:31.574 --> 01:55:32.114]  I don't know.
[01:55:32.994 --> 01:55:38.036]  But they're creating the destabilization to then offer the solution taking over the border.
[01:55:38.356 --> 01:55:42.737]  And their solution is total legalization, which will only cause an even bigger collapse.
[01:55:42.777 --> 01:55:47.379]  And we documented they're shipping the illegals in on buses and deploying them.
[01:55:47.759 --> 01:55:49.139]  They first denied that a month ago.
[01:55:49.199 --> 01:55:49.919]  Now it's confirmed.
[01:55:50.259 --> 01:55:51.360]  In closing, Joel Gilbert.
[01:55:52.324 --> 01:55:55.245]  How do you think it's going for Obama and the progressives?
[01:55:55.345 --> 01:55:57.185]  I see it as a 50-50 ball game.
[01:55:57.485 --> 01:55:58.605]  We're on a knife's edge.
[01:55:58.945 --> 01:56:00.165]  It could go either way.
[01:56:00.185 --> 01:56:02.866]  That's why we need maximum effort by everybody right now.
[01:56:02.886 --> 01:56:07.087]  Yeah, from their point of view, from Obama's point of view, he's very successful.
[01:56:07.547 --> 01:56:08.867]  He's agitating the country.
[01:56:08.907 --> 01:56:10.407]  He's divided black and white.
[01:56:10.547 --> 01:56:12.248]  He's divided rich and poor.
[01:56:12.728 --> 01:56:19.609]  And he will try to feed off of this and the next administration and the Democrat Socialists to maintain, to use the discontent
[01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:21.731]  To maintain a hold on power.
[01:56:22.611 --> 01:56:27.476]  The character of America emanates from our Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights.
[01:56:28.116 --> 01:56:33.901]  These created this American identity of freedom, free markets, and free speech and limited government.
[01:56:34.582 --> 01:56:46.793]  Obama is the last step of this vast left-wing conspiracy to destroy all of these wonderful things that grew wealth and made people free, not only in America, but all over the world.
[01:56:47.673 --> 01:56:55.561]  I think in my film it has a great chance, if it goes nationwide, to really expose the entire ideology and sick agenda.
[01:56:56.408 --> 01:56:58.750]  And that's why I'm asking everyone to go out and see it.
[01:56:59.270 --> 01:57:05.674]  If you know people in Denver, even if you don't, buy some tickets on Fandango and help us sell it out.
[01:57:06.154 --> 01:57:16.241]  Because if we do, we're going to expose the entire ideology and the history such that once people realize what they're doing, that it's not trying to help anybody.
[01:57:16.621 --> 01:57:19.843]  It's trying to break apart the greatest country in the world.
[01:57:21.465 --> 01:57:22.546]  And that's not rhetoric.
[01:57:23.266 --> 01:57:25.768]  It's just, I'm almost pinching myself every day.
[01:57:25.788 --> 01:57:33.432]  Am I dreaming that it's worse than we can describe how nasty, nasty these people are?
[01:57:34.133 --> 01:57:35.433]  Well, it's in their ideology.
[01:57:35.574 --> 01:57:49.742]  Obama's mentor, Bill Ayers, authored a document that said they were going to break up America into four regions, have it occupied by North Vietnam, North Korea, Russia, and China, put 25 million Americans in re-education centers.
[01:57:49.762 --> 01:57:50.983]  50 million and kill 25 million.
[01:57:51.423 --> 01:57:52.383]  Kill 25 million.
[01:57:52.743 --> 01:57:56.865]  This is the guy that we think wrote Obama's book and was his mentor.
[01:57:57.445 --> 01:58:06.828]  And Obama is the hood ornament on this evil ideology that was rejected by America, but because they put a new face with a hidden agenda.
[01:58:07.488 --> 01:58:09.069]  Imagine if Obama had told the truth in 2008.
[01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:14.794]  My father was a Soviet agent and I grew up in the world of American Marxism.
[01:58:15.234 --> 01:58:16.595]  I'm going to triple the deficit.
[01:58:16.915 --> 01:58:19.337]  I'm going to flood the country with illegals.
[01:58:19.758 --> 01:58:23.140]  I'm going to have the most secret government in history and I'm going to tax your healthcare.
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:25.362]  Now, he said the opposite.
[01:58:25.942 --> 01:58:27.825]  To get elected with a hidden agenda.
[01:58:28.205 --> 01:58:32.631]  It's the biggest fraud and manipulation of free people in the history of the world.
[01:58:32.671 --> 01:58:33.432]  It is, it is.
[01:58:33.752 --> 01:58:36.436]  The way to fight back is, I think, education.
[01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:37.858]  Get through the media blackout.
[01:58:38.613 --> 01:58:43.137]  And I think my film, There's No Place Like Utopia, has a shot because it's going to put it together for everything.
[01:58:43.177 --> 01:58:43.798]  Absolutely.
[01:58:44.198 --> 01:58:45.359]  Great job, Joel Gilbert.
[01:58:45.419 --> 01:58:46.701]  We'll get the website out again later.
[01:58:46.721 --> 01:58:47.381]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:48.062 --> 01:58:48.662]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:58:48.682 --> 01:58:50.784]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:50.844 --> 01:58:51.665]  It's an info war.
[01:58:52.085 --> 01:58:53.787]  They want to shut down our speech for a reason.
[01:58:53.827 --> 01:58:54.708]  We're hurting them bad.
[01:58:55.088 --> 01:58:58.231]  So, tell people to tune in to the show, too.
[01:58:58.271 --> 01:58:58.912]  Right now, folks.
[01:58:59.537 --> 01:59:06.580]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.861]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:14.144]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:59:14.324 --> 01:59:19.266]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:59:19.486 --> 01:59:22.548]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:59:22.808 --> 01:59:26.670]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:31.132]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:59:31.212 --> 01:59:41.237]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:59:41.437 --> 01:59:45.779]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:59:45.859 --> 01:59:49.241]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray
[01:59:49.261 --> 01:59:50.262]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.629 --> 02:00:19.810]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:21.271]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.051 --> 02:00:22.951]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.591 --> 02:00:27.213]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.793 --> 02:00:31.854]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:49.812]  I tell you, stuff is just getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[02:00:50.252 --> 02:01:01.782]  Strobe Talbot, the former editor of Newsweek, or was it Time Magazine, who worked for Clinton in the State Department, who said that, you know, world government needs to replace the United States, and that socialism needs to replace it.
[02:01:01.802 --> 02:01:02.983]  You can read his quotes online.
[02:01:03.003 --> 02:01:05.225]  He used to write about it in the magazine.
[02:01:06.986 --> 02:01:14.012]  He's come out and blamed Russia for shooting down the commercial airliner, saying that one of the separatist leaders took credit without giving proof.
[02:01:15.930 --> 02:01:17.411]  I always love it when he puts a tweet out.
[02:01:17.431 --> 02:01:33.157]  I mean, it'd be like if I put an article out, all he does is just put some text up there, you know, claiming that the separatists had meant that they did it and it was a mistake.
[02:01:33.497 --> 02:01:38.639]  I'll guarantee you if the Russian separatists did that, they wouldn't be telling you they did it and it was a mistake.
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.921]  I mean, that is ridiculous.
[02:01:43.499 --> 02:01:46.442]  And again, if it comes out Russia did it, then Russia will say that.
[02:01:47.484 --> 02:01:48.164]  Then I believe it.
[02:01:48.224 --> 02:01:50.987]  But I mean, I just don't believe anything out of George Soros and Strobe Talbot.
[02:01:51.688 --> 02:01:52.369]  What do you think?
[02:01:53.250 --> 02:01:57.955]  I know that the comments on the website and the stuff I see on Twitter, no one is buying this.
[02:01:57.995 --> 02:02:01.599]  And it's the same make and model they're saying as the other Malaysian missing plane.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:03.001]  So is it like Northwoods?
[02:02:03.141 --> 02:02:03.782]  I'm not saying this.
[02:02:03.802 --> 02:02:04.422]  People are saying this.
[02:02:04.963 --> 02:02:17.368]  Where they talk about having one plane where everybody gets on with the same make and model and tail number, and then they get off somewhere else, and then later you blow up the other plane, and that's why you've got to disappear the other plane, because you really don't want to shoot down a bunch of innocent people.
[02:02:17.708 --> 02:02:22.429]  You just blow it up by remote control as a drone and say that somebody else did it.
[02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:28.932]  And again, that's ABC News, Baltimore Sun.
[02:02:31.101 --> 02:02:31.421]  April 2001.
[02:02:31.801 --> 02:02:33.802]  Look up Operation Northwoods.
[02:02:34.182 --> 02:02:50.266]  Click web on the Google link and you will see articles from 2001 before 9-11 about a Pentagon plan to stage a shoot down of an airplane and replace it with another one.
[02:02:51.187 --> 02:02:52.887]  And we know about Diego Garcia.
[02:02:53.787 --> 02:02:55.028]  We know about the Indian Ocean.
[02:02:56.461 --> 02:03:00.683]  We know about all of it, and this plane has stunk from the beginning.
[02:03:00.703 --> 02:03:01.844]  There's clearly been a cover-up.
[02:03:02.484 --> 02:03:06.846]  The official story hasn't held, and I just, something smells bad.
[02:03:07.666 --> 02:03:10.368]  Out of all the planes that could get shot down, it's this one.
[02:03:13.229 --> 02:03:16.030]  I mean, did they just fly a drone over there, blow it up?
[02:03:17.311 --> 02:03:21.273]  We know our government's got all sorts of deals with the Malaysian government and black ops.
[02:03:22.537 --> 02:03:25.238]  This really stinks, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:25.618 --> 02:03:33.080]  And before Time Magazine and Newsweek and the New York Times come out and say that I'm saying this, I'm saying it's an official U.S.
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:35.521]  government plan and so we should look at it.
[02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:37.002]  In fact, they found the article.
[02:03:37.022 --> 02:03:37.442]  There it is.
[02:03:37.502 --> 02:03:38.262]  ABC News.
[02:03:42.243 --> 02:03:42.543]  U.S.
[02:03:42.583 --> 02:03:44.504]  military wanted to provoke war with Cuba.
[02:03:45.704 --> 02:03:46.705]  May 1st, 2001.
[02:03:47.665 --> 02:03:48.325]  I said April.
[02:03:48.385 --> 02:03:50.146]  I think the original article was like April 31st.
[02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:53.010]  Regardless, my member's pretty good.
[02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:54.331]  I was one day off.
[02:03:55.131 --> 02:03:58.032]  In early, you know, back then they would put stuff on the web the next day.
[02:03:58.052 --> 02:03:58.832]  I think that's what that was.
[02:03:59.152 --> 02:04:00.033]  Here, put it back up.
[02:04:00.053 --> 02:04:03.194]  I mean, I know the newscast is from April 31st, but it doesn't matter.
[02:04:04.034 --> 02:04:05.314]  Because there's the article, see?
[02:04:05.914 --> 02:04:11.716]  In the early 1960s, America's top military leaders reportedly drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in U.S.
[02:04:11.736 --> 02:04:14.057]  cities to create public support for a war against Cuba.
[02:04:14.397 --> 02:04:17.538]  Codenamed Operation Northwoods, the plans repeatedly included
[02:04:18.118 --> 02:04:26.284]  Reportedly included the possible assassination of Cuban immigrants, shinging boats on Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S.
[02:04:26.324 --> 02:04:28.766]  ship, and even orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S.
[02:04:28.786 --> 02:04:29.086]  cities.
[02:04:29.446 --> 02:04:35.151]  Yeah, shooting up movie theaters, plastic bombs at public events, plastic explosives.
[02:04:35.531 --> 02:04:36.051]  Plastique?
[02:04:36.992 --> 02:04:39.134]  You can go read Northwoods, it's like 12 pages long.
[02:04:40.354 --> 02:04:40.855]  Go read it!
[02:04:42.176 --> 02:04:44.297]  And I'm telling you, the globalists never do anything new.
[02:04:44.337 --> 02:04:46.219]  They just repeat plans.
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.341]  And they did a lot of stuff in Northwoods in Europe under Gladio.
[02:04:51.921 --> 02:04:53.242]  And under the NATO option.
[02:04:55.222 --> 02:04:57.163]  So, you know, we ought to get Pchenik on.
[02:04:57.963 --> 02:04:59.384]  I have no idea what he'll be saying.
[02:04:59.424 --> 02:05:00.304]  I'm sure it's interesting.
[02:05:00.844 --> 02:05:02.605]  We'll see if we can get him on.
[02:05:02.625 --> 02:05:05.465]  But I know he was over in Italy during all that.
[02:05:05.785 --> 02:05:07.086]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:05:09.864 --> 02:05:13.607]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:05:13.687 --> 02:05:14.868]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[02:05:14.948 --> 02:05:16.009]  God knows what's in there.
[02:05:16.249 --> 02:05:20.352]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:05:20.492 --> 02:05:26.296]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:05:26.416 --> 02:05:27.417]  That one is better.
[02:05:27.477 --> 02:05:28.437]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:05:28.738 --> 02:05:30.159]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:05:30.179 --> 02:05:30.679]  It's good water.
[02:05:30.799 --> 02:05:36.523]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:05:36.764 --> 02:05:43.829]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:05:44.009 --> 02:05:46.491]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:05:46.711 --> 02:05:54.657]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:05:54.677 --> 02:05:55.798]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:05:55.818 --> 02:05:56.799]  It's good water.
[02:05:56.999 --> 02:05:57.440]  Refreshing.
[02:05:57.460 --> 02:05:57.900]  It's good!

[02:06:31.999 --> 02:06:42.187]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:06:42.628 --> 02:06:48.793]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:07:52.548 --> 02:07:56.070]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[02:07:56.410 --> 02:07:59.972]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July.
[02:08:00.252 --> 02:08:08.116]  At MadeIn1776.com, Moulin Lambe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[02:08:19.562 --> 02:08:25.024]  If you let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:08:25.745 --> 02:08:30.207]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:08:30.747 --> 02:08:34.788]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[02:08:35.609 --> 02:08:36.889]  It's not about food.
[02:08:37.590 --> 02:08:40.171]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:08:46.846 --> 02:08:48.586]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:48.987 --> 02:08:51.987]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:57.389 --> 02:09:09.792]  To say there's bombshell news and developments at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and on my Twitter account, at RealAlexJones, is an understatement.
[02:09:11.373 --> 02:09:14.053]  We have a Malaysian airliner 777, if you can believe it,
[02:09:17.785 --> 02:09:33.858]  Shot down 50 miles inside Ukraine over Crimea, and within minutes of it happening a few hours ago, the government of Ukraine was already blaming the Russians with no proof.
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:47.189]  And then we now have Strobe Talbot, big globalist, Zbigniew Brzezinski type, sworn to world government, sworn to socialism, just search engine his name and his writings.
[02:09:48.615 --> 02:09:55.816]  Coming out and claiming that someone, you know, on Twitter or whatever, claiming to be some opposition person says they did it.
[02:09:57.757 --> 02:09:59.977]  Yeah, I heard Alex said he did it too!
[02:10:00.958 --> 02:10:04.398]  Again, very suspicious that they're putting the narrative out right up front.
[02:10:05.859 --> 02:10:07.559]  How did Dick Cheney want to start war?
[02:10:08.999 --> 02:10:11.260]  Back in 2007 with Iran.
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:13.660]  Cy Hirsch got the documents, talked to the officials.
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:15.981]  They wanted to have Navy SEALs attack U.S.
[02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:17.361]  ships in the Strait
[02:10:18.453 --> 02:10:20.195]  of Hormuz, but they said no.
[02:10:20.855 --> 02:10:21.996]  And reportedly Bush said no.
[02:10:24.018 --> 02:10:25.699]  Pretty powerful stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:29.042]  Cy Hirsch has also said that the Bin Laden death was fake and staged.
[02:10:29.062 --> 02:10:32.425]  Of course, we said that very early on, it was clear it was.
[02:10:32.766 --> 02:10:34.627]  Navy SEALs, families we've talked to say that.
[02:10:35.088 --> 02:10:39.431]  The SEALs know it was fake, that's why they killed almost everyone who was on the raid of the Bin Laden lookalike.
[02:10:42.614 --> 02:10:43.415]  It's just amazing.
[02:10:45.174 --> 02:10:45.816]  I don't know the truth.
[02:10:45.856 --> 02:10:46.898]  Maybe the Russians did do it.
[02:10:46.938 --> 02:10:48.080]  I mean, it's a war zone.
[02:10:48.141 --> 02:10:54.174]  Russia has said they're going to counter-strike, but it wouldn't be blowing up some other country's airliner in broad daylight at 33,000 feet.
[02:10:56.988 --> 02:10:59.010]  And then the big story, U.S.
[02:10:59.130 --> 02:11:01.152]  Army training to fight black Americans.
[02:11:01.712 --> 02:11:04.054]  Actual video up on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:04.695 --> 02:11:09.780]  I shot a 20-minute overdrive, almost 30-minute special report last night that aired after the nightly news.
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:15.184]  The news is always 30 minutes long, but when it's extended, when the main news ends, some stations are already carrying.
[02:11:16.664 --> 02:11:19.385]  Not just affiliate PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:11:19.845 --> 02:11:23.326]  We then go into, for just online viewers, an extra expanded overdrive.
[02:11:23.906 --> 02:11:25.726]  And we did a very important breakdown of this.
[02:11:25.786 --> 02:11:32.868]  It's regular army training battling black people in the drills.
[02:11:34.028 --> 02:11:39.149]  And I made a big deal about it when we saw some of this training a few years ago where it was only white people.
[02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:42.850]  So they're just training to attack certain ethnic groups
[02:11:43.925 --> 02:11:45.987]  And again, we're not demonizing the military even here.
[02:11:46.047 --> 02:11:46.968]  They don't like what's going on.
[02:11:46.988 --> 02:11:47.688]  They're freaking out.
[02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:49.209]  Joe Biggs talks about it.
[02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:50.831]  It's a very powerful breakdown.
[02:11:51.131 --> 02:11:53.513]  We heard large excerpts of it in the first hour today.
[02:11:56.535 --> 02:11:58.757]  Also, the Israeli military denies targeting children.
[02:11:59.318 --> 02:12:02.320]  Slam for not having the courage to talk to Hamas.
[02:12:02.841 --> 02:12:03.862]  That's not a zero hedge.
[02:12:04.810 --> 02:12:18.556]  Yeah, Israel's making big mistakes when they kill five teenagers playing soccer on a coast, at the beach, and then, you know, basically, don't say it was, you know, collateral damage, it was a mistake, that happens in war.
[02:12:18.576 --> 02:12:23.298]  And I'm not excusing it, but just saying, hey, we're under attack, we're fighting back, big deal.
[02:12:24.118 --> 02:12:26.439]  That loses moral high ground there.
[02:12:26.459 --> 02:12:28.280]  Again, I just want peace over there, folks.
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:31.461]  I don't dislike the Israelis, or the Palestinians, or anybody.
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:35.483]  But I'm fighting to keep my country free.
[02:12:37.125 --> 02:12:39.770]  And it is just a tragedy to see what's happening.
[02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:40.711]  But you know what?
[02:12:42.474 --> 02:12:44.437]  I've got to say, it's probably a 20, 30, 40 times bigger event.
[02:12:47.779 --> 02:12:53.604]  With ISIS being run by NATO, running around murdering Christians and non-radical Muslims all over the Middle East.
[02:12:53.644 --> 02:12:56.006]  And our government is funding and running that.
[02:12:56.687 --> 02:13:03.713]  And I don't know why all these trendies out there that want to scream about Israel all day and say that, you know, if you fall on a banana peel, Israel did it.
[02:13:05.394 --> 02:13:06.815]  There's other stuff going on too.
[02:13:08.036 --> 02:13:09.077]  I'm concerned about it all.
[02:13:09.878 --> 02:13:15.303]  But there's this cause-celeb thing with the left that's only about Palestinians.
[02:13:16.448 --> 02:13:17.670]  Or only about Israel.
[02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:28.023]  You know, the whole pro-Israel crowd is a very diverse group, but, you know, if you don't agree with anything, you know, I mean, everything they say, you're an anti-Semite.
[02:13:28.043 --> 02:13:30.186]  I mean, I'm just so sick of the whole thing.
[02:13:31.308 --> 02:13:32.149]  Aren't you sick of it?
[02:13:33.544 --> 02:13:35.906]  Don't you wish they could all just get along like Rodney King said?
[02:13:36.547 --> 02:13:38.309]  But again, it's that balkanization.
[02:13:38.789 --> 02:13:42.553]  Now for the balance of the hour, I've been really wanting to get him on for a while.
[02:13:42.873 --> 02:13:44.615]  He's been such a popular guest on the show.
[02:13:44.976 --> 02:13:48.279]  Dr. Peter Glinton is an outspoken advocate of holistic health.
[02:13:48.779 --> 02:13:51.782]  He has lectured thousands of people over two decades.
[02:13:52.563 --> 02:13:59.387]  And he delivers over 60 lectures each year as a regular speaker at Health Freedom Expo and Longevity Regional Meetings.
[02:13:59.947 --> 02:14:08.411]  He's been all over national TV, you name it, and of course been a frequent guest here, drglidden.com, and we'll also give you some of his other websites coming up.
[02:14:08.771 --> 02:14:13.714]  And he works with us as an advisor for InfoWarsHealth.com and InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:14:14.494 --> 02:14:16.775]  Which is a full line of longevity products.
[02:14:16.815 --> 02:14:24.918]  So, spoiler alert, about 80% of this talk you're going to hear is going to be cutting-edge health news and information, but I haven't even hardly plugged the last two hours.
[02:14:24.958 --> 02:14:26.439]  We need to do some mid-air refueling.
[02:14:27.039 --> 02:14:32.721]  You need to get the best, wide-spectrum, nutrient, vitamin systems.
[02:14:32.962 --> 02:14:34.022]  Over 400 products.
[02:14:34.282 --> 02:14:35.142]  They're all incredible.
[02:14:35.583 --> 02:14:37.363]  I use probably eight or nine of them routinely.
[02:14:37.844 --> 02:14:39.084]  And boy, do I miss it when I don't.
[02:14:39.664 --> 02:14:43.326]  If you want to really support the Liberty Movement, but also get high-quality, organic,
[02:14:43.866 --> 02:15:08.214]  Nutrients and vitamins like Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0, the Alex Pack, the Healthy Start Pack, the Polym Burst 2.0 that I'm probably a big sponsor of, my face is on the mug, all of it, EFA Plus, Selenium, all of it, you can go to m4warslife.com or m4warshealth.com, sign up there for AutoShip, you can get 10% off.
[02:15:08.834 --> 02:15:11.555]  But while there's a lot of different specials, when you pay $10, you can get
[02:15:14.376 --> 02:15:16.298]  A membership where you get big discounts.
[02:15:16.798 --> 02:15:18.800]  You can also sign up for AutoShip, get free shipping.
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:19.781]  There's a bunch of specials.
[02:15:20.121 --> 02:15:23.704]  You can find it at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsHealth.com.
[02:15:24.025 --> 02:15:29.629]  There's also toll-free numbers that I'll give you later that are right there on the sites, InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:15:30.130 --> 02:15:31.771]  You can sign up there and find all the products.
[02:15:32.632 --> 02:15:41.460]  You can also become a distributor, like I said, for $10 and get big discounts across the board and support the broadcast, but also sell the product.
[02:15:42.570 --> 02:15:52.076]  So it's a great startup business and a lot of people I know have gotten involved with InfoWarsTeam.com and become extremely successful doing that.
[02:15:52.596 --> 02:16:01.501]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Peter Glidden, Dr. Peter Glidden, to cover the waterfront with him today.
[02:16:01.521 --> 02:16:08.886]  We're going to talk about why does it seem people are getting sicker and sicker, suffering from more and more chronic illnesses?
[02:16:09.386 --> 02:16:10.467]  What are some of the reasons
[02:16:11.327 --> 02:16:15.109]  We need to educate ourselves and others about different ways to handle disease in the body.
[02:16:15.729 --> 02:16:16.989]  Why is this so?
[02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:23.012]  What is the philosophy of MDs and why don't they believe that the body can fix itself in many cases?
[02:16:23.452 --> 02:16:29.815]  Why are MDs taught that they are the only ones who can manage conditions because it's an imperial priesthood?
[02:16:30.655 --> 02:16:32.556]  And it is run by the big drug companies, folks.
[02:16:32.857 --> 02:16:35.739]  We'll talk about Big Pharma, how they're brainwashing us, and more.
[02:16:35.759 --> 02:16:40.082]  But also we'll talk about the new book that I've read, that my dad has read, and it's amazing.
[02:16:40.382 --> 02:16:41.282]  It's revolutionary.
[02:16:41.843 --> 02:16:44.104]  We sell it at infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:44.765 --> 02:16:49.148]  Epigenetics, the death of the genetic theory of disease transmission.
[02:16:50.785 --> 02:16:53.648]  And we're going to talk about that with Dr. Peter Glidden as well.
[02:16:54.068 --> 02:17:01.255]  So, Doc, thank you for coming on and thanks for your great support of InfoWarsHealth.com and InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:17:01.935 --> 02:17:07.300]  I know of the whole organization, you are, you know, the strongest overall
[02:17:07.921 --> 02:17:08.501]  Thank you so much.
[02:17:23.738 --> 02:17:25.560]  Alex, it's always a pleasure to be here.
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:26.180]  You're welcome.
[02:17:26.220 --> 02:17:34.628]  You know, like Benjamin Franklin said, my cousin, by the way, Benjamin Franklin, unless we hang together, most assuredly we will hang alone.
[02:17:35.489 --> 02:17:36.710]  That's right, absolutely.
[02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:42.115]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, but first off here today, what are you planning to cover?
[02:17:42.802 --> 02:17:48.486]  Well, everybody in this country is sick and we're not getting better, we're getting worse.
[02:17:48.606 --> 02:17:50.127]  Our health is deteriorating.
[02:17:51.247 --> 02:17:54.990]  Every single solitary month, things are getting worse.
[02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:58.112]  The leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, medical bills.
[02:17:58.152 --> 02:18:01.694]  The leading cause of death, MD-directed medical treatments.
[02:18:01.874 --> 02:18:07.878]  Something is going on here and Dr. Wallach and I are the only ones talking about it.
[02:18:08.678 --> 02:18:11.820]  The best place to hide something, of course, is in plain sight.
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:25.806]  So I'm going to pull back the curtains on what's going on here in the medical arena and really get into some very specific things people can do right now, today, to make a gigantic difference in their overall health.
[02:18:25.846 --> 02:18:30.309]  Because as God is my witness, Alex, people are suffering needlessly.
[02:18:31.149 --> 02:18:32.469]  Well, you're not just saying that.
[02:18:32.529 --> 02:18:33.730]  Look at every metric.
[02:18:33.930 --> 02:18:37.011]  They admit that hospitals are the number one killer in the country now.
[02:18:37.911 --> 02:18:43.413]  And then down the line, the drugs, the drug interactions, all of it.
[02:18:43.913 --> 02:18:48.454]  I know so many family members, so many people that go into have minor surgery and are dead.
[02:18:48.594 --> 02:18:50.735]  I mean, just dead all around me.
[02:18:50.875 --> 02:18:51.675]  Death, death, death.
[02:18:52.075 --> 02:18:55.796]  Drug resistant stuff pouring across the borders wide open.
[02:18:56.197 --> 02:18:57.277]  This is crazy town.
[02:18:57.825 --> 02:18:58.966]  It is crazy time.
[02:18:59.006 --> 02:19:01.427]  You know, it's not the gun, it's how it's used, right?
[02:19:01.487 --> 02:19:02.228]  Well, guess what?
[02:19:02.288 --> 02:19:04.049]  It's not the drug, it's how it's used.
[02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:05.850]  I'm not against drugs.
[02:19:05.930 --> 02:19:16.817]  I can prescribe drugs for goodness sake, but there's a way to use pharmaceutical medicines which is effective and supportive, and there's a way to use pharmaceutical medicines which is destructive.
[02:19:17.457 --> 02:19:23.581]  And most people in the United States have no earthly idea that their medical doctors, I mean, bless their hearts,
[02:19:24.298 --> 02:19:32.211]  Your MD may be the nicest person God ever created, a humanitarian, really great person, but they don't know what's best for you.
[02:19:32.752 --> 02:19:34.655]  They only know what they've been trained in.
[02:19:35.396 --> 02:19:40.438]  And what they've been trained in, as it turns out, is just one small piece of the pie of medical science.
[02:19:41.339 --> 02:19:55.605]  And when people understand how MDs are trained to think about the relationship between the human body and disease, everything will change when people understand how the MDs think and how they operate.
[02:19:56.105 --> 02:20:04.449]  And you know, quite frankly, that there are, in fact, science-based, clinically verified alternatives to drugs and surgery.
[02:20:06.130 --> 02:20:09.072]  Stay there Dr. Glidden, this is powerful stuff coming up.
[02:20:09.772 --> 02:20:11.794]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[02:20:12.134 --> 02:20:25.143]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[02:20:26.204 --> 02:20:27.885]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[02:20:28.125 --> 02:20:30.286]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[02:20:30.326 --> 02:20:36.409]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:44.754]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[02:20:45.334 --> 02:20:50.816]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[02:20:51.036 --> 02:20:57.899]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:20:57.999 --> 02:20:58.259]  That's 877-532-5388.
[02:20:58.359 --> 02:20:59.340]  Or go to faketv.com.
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:01.221]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:21:09.844 --> 02:21:16.187]  By now you may know that a Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that's easily transferred from person to person over the internet.

[02:24:29.069 --> 02:24:30.830]  Health is so fundamental.
[02:24:30.910 --> 02:24:35.053]  We are under a eugenics, Rockefeller Medicine-based system.
[02:24:35.073 --> 02:24:44.000]  You've heard medical doctors on this show, famous brain surgeons, neurologists, people like Blaylock saying the exact same thing.
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:47.142]  Now you see total state-run hospitals.
[02:24:48.403 --> 02:24:49.423]  The VA's the model.
[02:24:50.764 --> 02:24:52.426]  Telling veterans, just go die in a ditch.
[02:24:53.419 --> 02:24:55.500]  Oh yeah, you're all going to get, you know, health care now.
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:57.841]  It's just going to be horrible quality care.
[02:24:58.861 --> 02:25:02.583]  Dr. Peter Glidden is our guest breaking this down right now.
[02:25:02.603 --> 02:25:10.626]  And if you're watching him on television, you can see his website right up there on screen.
[02:25:11.247 --> 02:25:16.609]  And I want him to describe what that free doctor book is all about, because that sounds very interesting.
[02:25:18.667 --> 02:25:37.954]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, it is very important to really consciously think about this each day, that if we, by increments, because none of us are perfect, really start trying to drink more water, get healthy, take the right vitamins and minerals, eat the fresh food, that'll change our lives.
[02:25:38.294 --> 02:25:40.515]  That's a process, but people can see the process in my life.
[02:25:40.935 --> 02:25:47.258]  Incredibly stressful job, incredibly stressful life, long hours, but I look a lot better than I looked a few years ago, and it's a process.
[02:25:48.158 --> 02:25:50.861]  But none of it's going to happen overnight.
[02:25:51.501 --> 02:25:52.902]  There's his book, The M.D.
[02:25:53.063 --> 02:25:54.324]  Emperor Has No Clothes.
[02:25:54.944 --> 02:25:59.048]  And again, we'll give you that website, putting Lytton back up on screen, via video Skype.
[02:25:59.068 --> 02:26:07.215]  If you're a listener, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show to find the free video feeds that accompany the radio show right now.
[02:26:07.515 --> 02:26:09.197]  FreeDoctorBook.com.
[02:26:09.477 --> 02:26:12.740]  Tell us about that, Doc, and then let's get into the big bombshell info.
[02:26:13.379 --> 02:26:14.960]  Well, knowledge is power, Alex.
[02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:15.740]  I mean, look around.
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:16.601]  Everybody's sick.
[02:26:16.681 --> 02:26:17.641]  Everybody's suffering.
[02:26:17.681 --> 02:26:18.822]  Everybody's getting worse.
[02:26:18.902 --> 02:26:20.883]  Everybody's taking prescription medications.
[02:26:20.963 --> 02:26:21.924]  I mean, you know, I'm 56.
[02:26:22.864 --> 02:26:25.366]  I didn't know anybody when I was a kid that had Alzheimer's.
[02:26:25.846 --> 02:26:27.807]  I didn't know anybody that had autism.
[02:26:27.947 --> 02:26:32.330]  Alzheimer's has risen from obscurity to become the sixth leading cause of death.
[02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:35.391]  One out of 89 children now are born autistic.
[02:26:35.852 --> 02:26:37.412]  Arthritis is skyrocketing.
[02:26:37.452 --> 02:26:38.353]  High blood pressure is
[02:26:38.473 --> 02:26:46.158]  Medical doctors that went through in the 50s and 60s have said on this show that they would have to get on airplanes to fly to see a child with cancer.
[02:26:46.398 --> 02:26:47.218]  It was so rare.
[02:26:47.598 --> 02:26:49.620]  Now there's just kids everywhere dying all around me.
[02:26:50.180 --> 02:26:58.185]  And the reason that this is happening is not because of, you know, excessive radiation and pollution in the world.
[02:26:58.705 --> 02:27:03.628]  There are factors that have to do with this, but the reason that most people are sick and suffering
[02:27:04.248 --> 02:27:06.611]  Is because we've taken the wrong dog to the hunt.
[02:27:06.732 --> 02:27:15.943]  I mean, for goodness sake, if you had a, heaven forbid, if you had a bullet in your arm, you would not go to a chiropractor to have that removed because that's not their wheelhouse.
[02:27:16.504 --> 02:27:19.648]  It's not the wheelhouse of the chiropractor to do surgery, right?
[02:27:19.728 --> 02:27:20.969]  Well, as it turns out,
[02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:27.333]  Your MD is the wrong person to go to if you're suffering with a chronic disease.
[02:27:27.974 --> 02:27:35.558]  The wheelhouse of the MD is trauma care, surgery when it's absolutely necessary, and a handful of infectious diseases.
[02:27:36.078 --> 02:27:47.005]  That's their wheelhouse, that's what they excel in, and in a perfect world, it would be illegal for them to do anything else because when they bring their philosophy of medicine to bear,
[02:27:47.925 --> 02:27:52.268]  On a human body with a chronic disease, they miss the point completely.
[02:27:52.288 --> 02:27:54.630]  And this is why we're sick and suffering.
[02:27:55.090 --> 02:28:02.195]  Because the MDs, bless their hearts, I mean I have a lot of friends who are MDs, your father's an MD, there's room in the world for the MD.
[02:28:02.736 --> 02:28:06.619]  But not when it comes to chronic disease, for goodness sake.
[02:28:07.299 --> 02:28:09.520]  We're dying at record rates.
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:11.981]  I mean, not even dying, just suffering, right?
[02:28:12.442 --> 02:28:16.764]  Can't even play 18 holes of golf anymore because people, you know, their knees can't handle it.
[02:28:17.044 --> 02:28:20.206]  People can't fall asleep at night without a sedative.
[02:28:20.566 --> 02:28:24.248]  Chronic heartburn, chronic just low-grade stuff that's whittling away.
[02:28:24.328 --> 02:28:26.329]  It's because they don't have the trace elements.
[02:28:26.449 --> 02:28:27.970]  It's because they don't have the trace elements, right?
[02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:29.811]  Well, this is the thing.
[02:28:30.731 --> 02:28:31.772]  Our position is.
[02:28:32.642 --> 02:28:36.565]  That when it comes to chronic disease, there's education that people need to know.
[02:28:36.765 --> 02:28:43.230]  And all chronic disease can be traced back to nutrient deficiencies, especially minerals.
[02:28:43.330 --> 02:28:45.612]  Nutrient deficiencies, especially minerals.
[02:28:46.053 --> 02:28:49.756]  But the sad fact of the matter is, it is impossible to get
[02:28:50.536 --> 02:28:53.618]  All of the body's nutrient needs met just by eating food.
[02:28:53.658 --> 02:28:54.359]  You can't do it.
[02:28:54.479 --> 02:28:55.199]  It's impossible.
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:29:18.155]  So, unless and until you are supplementing your diet with a good, high-quality medical nutrition program, it is only a matter of time until you run out of something, and then something breaks, and then your only option, because of Obamacare, is to go to an MD who hasn't been trained in how to fix it.
[02:29:18.755 --> 02:29:23.898]  They've just been trained in how to manage it, and this is why everybody's dying.
[02:29:25.119 --> 02:29:30.142]  That's one of the biggest factors, I agree with you, and it's scary that the U.S.
[02:29:30.182 --> 02:29:33.024]  leads the world in breast cancer and diabetes.
[02:29:33.084 --> 02:29:34.445]  I mean, we're not being negative here.
[02:29:34.725 --> 02:29:37.287]  We're being very positive to admit the problems.
[02:29:37.387 --> 02:29:39.028]  Long 18-minute segment coming up.
[02:29:39.348 --> 02:29:42.450]  I'm going to try to give you the floor for most of it to really lay out
[02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:47.773]  Some of the basic truths that are revolutionary and then get into some of the breaking news.
[02:29:47.793 --> 02:29:49.213]  I want to talk about epigenetics.
[02:29:49.253 --> 02:29:51.194]  I know you're really into that as well.
[02:29:51.254 --> 02:29:56.137]  I find that to be so exciting and more and more mainline science is saying this is where it's at.
[02:29:57.137 --> 02:29:58.678]  We'll be right back with Dr. Peter Glidden.
[02:29:58.938 --> 02:29:59.839]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.339 --> 02:30:01.940]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:05.542]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.473 --> 02:30:16.420]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:20.844]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:30:21.205 --> 02:30:25.770]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:30:26.170 --> 02:30:28.791]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:30:29.091 --> 02:30:34.273]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:30:34.554 --> 02:30:41.416]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:30:41.937 --> 02:30:45.698]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:30:46.058 --> 02:30:50.840]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:51.181 --> 02:30:52.021]  This is innovating.
[02:30:52.301 --> 02:30:59.604]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:30:59.784 --> 02:31:03.845]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:31:04.045 --> 02:31:09.527]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:31:10.137 --> 02:31:11.339]  I can, like, taste dirt in it.
[02:31:11.419 --> 02:31:12.520]  God knows what's in this.
[02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:16.845]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:31:17.026 --> 02:31:22.913]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a Pro-Pure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:31:23.053 --> 02:31:24.074]  That one is better.
[02:31:24.134 --> 02:31:25.095]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:31:25.376 --> 02:31:26.797]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:31:26.857 --> 02:31:27.358]  It's good water.
[02:31:27.458 --> 02:31:33.262]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:31:33.502 --> 02:31:40.627]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[02:31:40.847 --> 02:31:43.369]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:31:43.569 --> 02:31:51.615]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:31:51.775 --> 02:31:53.036]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:31:53.096 --> 02:31:53.816]  It's good water.
[02:31:54.016 --> 02:31:54.457]  Refreshing.
[02:31:54.477 --> 02:31:54.917]  It's good!

[02:32:09.548 --> 02:32:11.429]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:32:11.769 --> 02:32:19.431]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:32:19.791 --> 02:32:27.093]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:32:27.373 --> 02:32:31.634]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that was some good stuff.
[02:32:31.954 --> 02:32:42.138]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:32:42.579 --> 02:32:48.761]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:32:49.061 --> 02:32:51.302]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:32:51.322 --> 02:32:55.304]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[02:32:55.444 --> 02:32:57.027]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[02:32:57.388 --> 02:33:01.335]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[02:33:17.876 --> 02:33:25.517]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:35.583 --> 02:33:42.185]  Ukraine says they will present evidence of Russian military involvement in the Malaysian shoot-down.
[02:33:43.066 --> 02:33:47.047]  Perfect that it was a third-party, outside nation, not even part of Europe.
[02:33:47.667 --> 02:33:49.708]  Perfectly selected to demonize Russia.
[02:33:50.608 --> 02:33:53.209]  Why would Russia shoot down a Malaysian airliner?
[02:33:56.450 --> 02:33:58.351]  This is meant to stop Russia
[02:33:59.528 --> 02:34:06.214]  From going up against the Ukrainian NATO Air Force that is now bombing targets on and over their border.
[02:34:07.254 --> 02:34:10.237]  But regardless of which side you're on, I'm not on either.
[02:34:11.678 --> 02:34:13.199]  Everybody should be concerned about this.
[02:34:14.140 --> 02:34:16.922]  Because it's escalating very, very quickly.
[02:34:17.743 --> 02:34:20.105]  It is the season of escalation, isn't it?
[02:34:22.987 --> 02:34:25.608]  And now is the time to get prepared, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:26.449 --> 02:34:36.414]  That's why it's so important that everybody get high-quality, non-GMO, extremely affordable, storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.com.
[02:34:36.754 --> 02:34:41.596]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex, right there on that area of the site.
[02:34:41.616 --> 02:34:46.439]  You'll find their best discounts on four-week food supplies in the plastic tote containers.
[02:34:46.459 --> 02:34:48.800]  This is the best way to transport it and save it.
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:56.046]  Uh, and it's, a lot of it's what you call, I guess, freeze-dried, so it lasts a lot longer, it's higher quality, isn't as heavy as cans.
[02:34:56.447 --> 02:34:59.910]  Three months' supply, 500, uh, 450 servings.
[02:35:01.151 --> 02:35:03.093]  Give them a call, 866-229-0927.
[02:35:03.594 --> 02:35:05.656]  You're crazy if you don't have high-quality, storable food.
[02:35:06.176 --> 02:35:09.620]  And the place that I get mine is mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:35:11.033 --> 02:35:24.018]  Separately, InfidelBodyArmor.com, made right here in America by veterans, super high quality, level 3, at the lowest price you're going to find because it's not ceramic.
[02:35:24.918 --> 02:35:30.961]  And you can go check out all their great body armor, get it while you still can, InfidelBodyArmor.com or 888-608-6605.
[02:35:34.943 --> 02:35:37.905]  And they're just fabulous folks as well.
[02:35:38.806 --> 02:35:50.514]  And we're running specials throughout the month of July on all the Made in America apparel, pro-gun apparel, you name it, at MadeIn1776.com, the subsection of InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:35:50.534 --> 02:35:54.397]  And I'm kind of plugging a lot of stuff this hour because I didn't really do it in the first two hours.
[02:35:54.857 --> 02:35:58.639]  We sell high-quality products, promote high-quality, life-changing products.
[02:35:59.580 --> 02:35:59.960]  I don't know.
[02:36:19.451 --> 02:36:23.296]  Reaches 20 million people a week, one way or another, on all the different platforms.
[02:36:23.536 --> 02:36:26.480]  And we do it for about $8 million a year.
[02:36:27.241 --> 02:36:28.502]  And that sounds like a lot of money.
[02:36:28.583 --> 02:36:30.145]  It's not when you talk about media.
[02:36:31.166 --> 02:36:37.153]  Okay, I mean the local paper costs tens upon millions to run a year and loses money.
[02:36:38.194 --> 02:36:41.395]  And it's one of the least unprofitable ones in the country.
[02:36:41.415 --> 02:36:45.877]  You know, they talk about the statesman as a model of success because some of its divisions make money.
[02:36:46.337 --> 02:36:54.621]  I mean, we reach, conservatively, Infowars.com on Alexa 20, 30, 40 times more than that paper does.
[02:36:55.561 --> 02:36:57.142]  And it's a paper that serves millions.
[02:36:57.162 --> 02:36:58.702]  I mean, that's just an example.
[02:36:58.762 --> 02:37:00.043]  Go look at the ratings online.
[02:37:01.043 --> 02:37:03.164]  It's just the bang for the buck.
[02:37:04.358 --> 02:37:06.999]  Most talk show hosts would have a radio show as big as mine.
[02:37:07.039 --> 02:37:16.164]  They have about three employees, a website that posted a few articles every day, and we'd have some t-shirts and mugs we sold, and I would just have radio advertising, and I would make all that money for myself.
[02:37:17.544 --> 02:37:18.565]  And I would have a private jet.
[02:37:19.685 --> 02:37:20.846]  And I'd have a giant mansion.
[02:37:22.106 --> 02:37:22.927]  I'm not into that stuff.
[02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:24.721]  I mean, I like a car.
[02:37:24.781 --> 02:37:26.163]  You know, Ford truck runs good.
[02:37:26.703 --> 02:37:28.666]  Got a Charger as well I've had for six years.
[02:37:28.706 --> 02:37:29.366]  I got two cars.
[02:37:29.947 --> 02:37:31.409]  And I, you know, dress okay.
[02:37:31.449 --> 02:37:31.929]  I mean, you know.
[02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:36.594]  But that's not my goal in life is not to just make money.
[02:37:37.335 --> 02:37:38.116]  I want to have freedom.
[02:37:38.156 --> 02:37:39.217]  I want to defeat the globalists.
[02:37:39.237 --> 02:37:42.901]  So I've taken the money that a talk show host at this level would be making
[02:37:43.562 --> 02:37:56.638]  And I put it into expanding media operations, and reporters, and researchers, and bigger servers, and magazines, and films, and news websites, and nightly news, and by the grace of God, it is really having a giant effect.
[02:37:56.719 --> 02:37:59.021]  I want to find the lever that moves the world.
[02:38:00.089 --> 02:38:01.730]  I want to affect fundamental change.
[02:38:01.850 --> 02:38:04.611]  I want to really stop the globalists and the progressives.
[02:38:05.332 --> 02:38:06.672]  And we're doing that thanks to you.
[02:38:06.712 --> 02:38:07.513]  So pray for us.
[02:38:08.013 --> 02:38:08.553]  Support us.
[02:38:08.953 --> 02:38:10.634]  Support our local AM and FM affiliates.
[02:38:10.654 --> 02:38:11.495]  Spread the word about them.
[02:38:11.715 --> 02:38:12.775]  Become a local sponsor.
[02:38:13.035 --> 02:38:14.396]  Call their sponsors and thank them.
[02:38:15.097 --> 02:38:16.617]  Just like I had Joel Gilbert on last hour.
[02:38:16.637 --> 02:38:17.738]  I have no interest in his film.
[02:38:18.138 --> 02:38:19.559]  And I'm saying go watch his movie.
[02:38:19.579 --> 02:38:20.159]  Go, go, go.
[02:38:20.459 --> 02:38:21.600]  Make sure it becomes a big hit.
[02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:23.721]  Because then it will have an effect.
[02:38:24.935 --> 02:38:26.216]  Support us financially.
[02:38:26.256 --> 02:38:31.497]  We don't take money at gunpoint like the IRS does and give it to NPR or MSNBC, as I say.
[02:38:31.938 --> 02:38:32.918]  Shop with the good guys.
[02:38:32.998 --> 02:38:33.538]  Free will.
[02:38:33.798 --> 02:38:43.022]  Get high quality products at InfoWarsLife.com, at InfoWarsHealth.com, at InfoWarsTeam.com to be a distributor, InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:38:43.962 --> 02:38:45.644]  This is how you fund us.
[02:38:45.744 --> 02:38:46.865]  This is how it's done.
[02:38:46.885 --> 02:38:49.547]  There's a lot of new products out from Longevity.
[02:38:50.247 --> 02:38:55.252]  Immortallium and so many others, which is breaking research.
[02:38:55.272 --> 02:39:04.480]  I want to get into some of the stuff we're discovering about DNA and more with Dr. Glidden, who joins us right now.
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:07.602]  Dr. Glidden, you've got the floor for the next 14 minutes or so.
[02:39:07.943 --> 02:39:09.404]  Break down the big picture for folks.
[02:39:10.623 --> 02:39:11.183]  The greatest.
[02:39:11.824 --> 02:39:13.745]  Well, here's the big picture, folks.
[02:39:15.686 --> 02:39:21.550]  It is impossible for your body to optimize its structure and function without 90 essential nutrients.
[02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:24.151]  There are 90 essential nutrients that your body needs.
[02:39:25.272 --> 02:39:30.795]  16 minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 amino acids, and 2 essential fatty acids.
[02:39:31.376 --> 02:39:31.956]  The sad
[02:39:32.316 --> 02:39:48.934]  The fact of the matter here, however, is that even if you owned 100 acres of organic farmland and had the best organic food in the world and only ate your stuff, you would still be deficient in nutrients because the nutrients that your body needs are not present in the food.
[02:39:48.954 --> 02:39:49.574]  They're not there.
[02:39:49.735 --> 02:39:51.456]  They are not all there.
[02:39:52.357 --> 02:40:03.280]  So, unless you are supplementing with effective, efficient, absorbable nutritional supplements appropriate for your body weight, it's only a matter of time until something breaks.
[02:40:03.340 --> 02:40:15.243]  Now look, the information that I've gleaned and that Dr. Wallach has gleaned from 20, 30, 40 years of clinical experience as licensed naturopathic physicians is unique.
[02:40:15.784 --> 02:40:20.505]  And this information is so important for people to understand, I'm giving it away.
[02:40:21.085 --> 02:40:24.249]  I wrote a book, Alex referenced, The Empty Emperor Has No Clothes.
[02:40:24.509 --> 02:40:25.590]  I'm giving it away.
[02:40:25.950 --> 02:40:41.927]  When you get my book, you will be able to understand what to do, the simple steps you can take, which longevity nutritional supplements are best for you, which nutritional supplements are best for you, which foods are good, which foods are bad, because you're not taught this in school.
[02:40:42.087 --> 02:40:43.108]  You're not taught it.
[02:40:43.889 --> 02:41:02.263]  You know, the best way to get out from underneath the death grip of the medical insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry is to get your body so healthy that you don't need to use them unless, of course, you know, you have some type of, heaven forbid, traumatic accident to the body.
[02:41:02.803 --> 02:41:07.307]  So that's why I put this website together, freedoctorbook.com.
[02:41:07.347 --> 02:41:09.388]  Just go there, you'll get my book for free.
[02:41:09.508 --> 02:41:09.969]  It's free.
[02:41:10.729 --> 02:41:12.130]  Because you need knowledge.
[02:41:12.210 --> 02:41:18.032]  For instance, did you know that heartburn is associated with not enough calcium and not enough salt?
[02:41:18.692 --> 02:41:24.715]  Did you know that restless legs at night in bed is associated with not enough calcium, not enough magnesium?
[02:41:25.235 --> 02:41:30.597]  Did you know that high blood pressure is associated with not enough calcium and magnesium?
[02:41:30.977 --> 02:41:39.221]  Did you know that selenium supplementation, selenium, a simple mineral, cheaper than dirt, because it's made from dirt,
[02:41:39.961 --> 02:41:49.068]  Selenium supplementation at 200 micrograms a day, which is a tiny amount, reduces breast cancer occurrence by 82%.
[02:41:50.529 --> 02:42:01.977]  It also reduces prostate cancer occurrence by 69%, colon cancer by 64%, and lung cancer by 39%, even if you're a smoker.
[02:42:01.997 --> 02:42:05.239]  You know, why don't the Susan G. Komen women know this?
[02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:08.302]  Because they don't want you to know this.
[02:42:09.002 --> 02:42:18.816]  It is not the medical industry's job to keep you healthy, and as God is my witness, thank God for Novocaine, thank God for the sterile technique in the mattress suture.
[02:42:19.597 --> 02:42:21.119]  Surgery is complicated.
[02:42:21.439 --> 02:42:22.561]  Healing is easy.
[02:42:23.334 --> 02:42:31.980]  You've been duped by a hundred years of pharmaceutical propaganda, making you believe that healing is a complicated, sophisticated process.
[02:42:32.140 --> 02:42:32.860]  It is not.
[02:42:33.601 --> 02:42:35.602]  Surgery is a complicated process.
[02:42:35.762 --> 02:42:37.563]  And thank God for the surgeons who do it.
[02:42:38.304 --> 02:42:39.384]  But healing is easy.
[02:42:39.585 --> 02:42:41.066]  Our fundamental position.
[02:42:41.626 --> 02:42:44.688]  Give your body the nutrients that it needs to fix itself.
[02:42:45.428 --> 02:42:47.690]  Stop eating food that's gumming up the works.
[02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:49.111]  Get out of the way.
[02:42:50.143 --> 02:42:51.288]  And let the healing begin!
[02:42:51.629 --> 02:42:53.195]  You would not believe!
[02:42:54.352 --> 02:42:59.535]  The things that I've seen people recover from with science-based, clinically verified... Oh, I know, I know.
[02:42:59.655 --> 02:43:14.584]  I've seen people that don't know who they are get on Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Ted Anderson's dad, and then he got his memory back, and so many old people that have skin falling off, and then they don't eat any fruits or vegetables, and they don't... and they've got scurvy!
[02:43:15.204 --> 02:43:21.708]  I mean, they won't even tell you in the hospital that they've ever had a case of scurvy in the United States, even though it's rampant!
[02:43:23.166 --> 02:43:24.769]  Simple vitamin C deficiency.
[02:43:24.809 --> 02:43:28.235]  Simple vitamin C. Rick, it's a simple vitamin D deficiency, right?
[02:43:28.916 --> 02:43:32.943]  Dr. Wallach was giving a lecture a couple weeks ago in Los Angeles.
[02:43:32.963 --> 02:43:34.846]  350 people were scheduled to attend.
[02:43:34.866 --> 02:43:35.687]  1,100 showed up.
[02:43:37.245 --> 02:43:43.393]  I mean, they had the fire marshal came and they had to move half of the crowd outside onto the lawn.
[02:43:43.933 --> 02:43:44.614]  Why is this?
[02:43:44.674 --> 02:43:53.585]  Because there were 400 people in a suburb of Los Angeles who recovered from type 2 diabetes with medical nutrition.
[02:43:54.166 --> 02:43:55.267]  And that word spreads.
[02:43:55.868 --> 02:43:56.188]  Folks,
[02:43:57.329 --> 02:44:10.857]  The stuff that we need to know about the relationship between the human body and nutrition, that stuff that we need to know is so far outside of most people's reference ranges, that man, they didn't even know they didn't know that.
[02:44:10.878 --> 02:44:15.740]  By the way, let me ask you this question, because I hope Dell's Children's Center here in Austin
[02:44:16.921 --> 02:44:32.489]  Over the winter got filled with children including little kids that I know personally from good families that eat organic food and they would all get a virus and get pancreatitis basically and then they would tell them no you're just type 1 diabetes is genetic.
[02:44:32.849 --> 02:44:34.410]  They were ages 2 to 5 or 6.
[02:44:34.650 --> 02:44:38.172]  It was a pandemic and even the hospital
[02:44:39.266 --> 02:44:55.811]  was admitting no they get a virus then they get it but it's genetic well how do you get a virus that causes pancreatitis which I then went and talked to some medical doctors and they said no no it probably can be reversed a lot of the time but we're just being told to just make them a diabetic for life say it's genetic
[02:44:57.012 --> 02:44:58.653]  And then I talked to all these parents.
[02:44:59.233 --> 02:45:02.374]  I mean, something weird is going on here.
[02:45:02.434 --> 02:45:04.514]  Because, I mean, here's an example.
[02:45:05.174 --> 02:45:07.975]  They know that iodine is needed by the body.
[02:45:08.035 --> 02:45:10.676]  They used to make people put it in salt until the 60s.
[02:45:11.316 --> 02:45:15.797]  And then now the government puts all these bad halogens, the bromine, the bromides in the food.
[02:45:15.817 --> 02:45:17.258]  To get rid of iodine.
[02:45:17.458 --> 02:45:22.659]  And then I finally got on real true nascent iodine that we promote, Survival Shield X2.
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:24.520]  One element
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:28.082]  in the last year has literally changed my life.
[02:45:28.142 --> 02:45:30.544]  Now, that's at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:31.544 --> 02:45:42.912]  InfoWarsHealth.com, the Beyond Tangerine 2.0, it's got 90 things in it when the government's only saying you need a few, and it's been life-changing for myself and so many people.
[02:45:43.152 --> 02:45:48.516]  That's how I started doing more research, but just specifically, what's going on, before we get into Iodine briefly,
[02:45:49.952 --> 02:45:51.953]  I don't know what you're going to say, but I respect your view.
[02:45:51.973 --> 02:45:56.096]  I want to find out why it's helped me so much and why they don't want people to know about this.
[02:45:56.116 --> 02:46:00.079]  Do you have any word on the diabetes and what's happening there?
[02:46:00.119 --> 02:46:01.300]  I mean, it's epidemic.
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:08.205]  They're saying half the public by 2025 will have type 2, and then suddenly viruses are causing kids to get type 1?
[02:46:08.985 --> 02:46:11.145]  Well, there's a lot of cognitive dissonance here, right?
[02:46:11.185 --> 02:46:14.006]  Because if a disease is truly genetic, it can't be modified.
[02:46:14.026 --> 02:46:15.746]  I mean, the color of your eyes is genetic.
[02:46:16.326 --> 02:46:17.527]  Your sex is genetic.
[02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:25.188]  I mean, you could go to Sweden for a sex change operation, but you know, you can't affect a genetic illness in any way, shape, or form.
[02:46:25.648 --> 02:46:36.330]  So if you can modify the presentation of an illness, like type 2 diabetes or Alzheimer's, with diet and lifestyle, then by definition it's not genetic.
[02:46:36.870 --> 02:46:44.155]  But because of lack of information here, lack of education, people just don't understand this.
[02:46:44.175 --> 02:46:56.883]  1957, Dr. Walter Mertz, an MD, published a study that proved that the mineral chromium was related to a deficiency in chromium was related to type 2 diabetes.
[02:46:57.504 --> 02:47:03.308]  Research after that showed another mineral, vanadium, necessary for proper blood sugar metabolism.
[02:47:04.008 --> 02:47:12.093]  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, over 90% of the soil in the United States is deficient in chromium.
[02:47:12.153 --> 02:47:12.574]  Exactly.
[02:47:12.654 --> 02:47:13.094]  So guess what?
[02:47:13.654 --> 02:47:16.996]  You run out of chromium, you develop type 2 diabetes.
[02:47:17.477 --> 02:47:24.401]  You put chromium back into the body, your body optimizes its ability to process blood sugar.
[02:47:24.441 --> 02:47:25.162]  And you know what?
[02:47:25.642 --> 02:47:26.823]  It gets even worse, Alex.
[02:47:27.603 --> 02:47:32.146]  Because according to the Food and Drug Administration, the only thing that can cure a disease is a drug.
[02:47:32.846 --> 02:47:46.775]  So, as a licensed physician, if I had 100,000 patients with type 2 diabetes, definitive diagnosis, and they get on board a medical nutrition program, no more type 2 diabetes, I would not be able to say that I cured it.
[02:47:47.095 --> 02:47:55.741]  And if I was able to prove it, that I cured it, the pharmaceutical industry would make the nutritional supplement that I used a drug.
[02:47:56.721 --> 02:47:59.042]  And this is a gigantic problem.
[02:47:59.462 --> 02:48:03.304]  This is why we need to educate people about the stuff that they can do.
[02:48:03.404 --> 02:48:04.444]  I mean, it's elementary.
[02:48:04.464 --> 02:48:07.846]  They're saying healthy packs that will change your life, for goodness sake.
[02:48:08.406 --> 02:48:16.130]  They're saying artificial stuff is the only thing that can help you that blocks the symptoms or manipulate something else in your body.
[02:48:16.330 --> 02:48:16.970]  That's correct.
[02:48:17.170 --> 02:48:18.611]  And I know people that are on
[02:48:19.551 --> 02:48:34.152]  Different serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like Paxil, that has caused them to get cancer, that has caused them to get villago, where your skin turns white, and then the doctor tells them, no, your Paxil did this.
[02:48:35.053 --> 02:48:37.715]  I mean, it's just so crazy, but let me ask you specifically.
[02:48:38.476 --> 02:48:51.766]  Survival Shield X2 that I developed doing research with Dr. Group, this is from the actual crystals, and what it's done to me has just been off the charts, the energy, the clarity, all of it.
[02:48:51.806 --> 02:49:01.054]  And I know everybody's talking about how important this is, but how is one thing like iodine, what's your view on iodine?
[02:49:01.514 --> 02:49:05.355]  Well, iodine is an essential nutrient in the human body.
[02:49:05.675 --> 02:49:06.895]  It's an essential nutrient.
[02:49:07.055 --> 02:49:13.736]  And, you know, without iodine, certain metabolic functions cannot happen.
[02:49:13.756 --> 02:49:17.677]  It's kind of like if your car runs out of engine oil, well, guess what?
[02:49:17.697 --> 02:49:19.717]  The engine's going to seize up and that's not good.
[02:49:19.757 --> 02:49:23.658]  Well, if your car runs out of brake fluid, something else is going to happen.
[02:49:23.718 --> 02:49:27.199]  If the car runs out of air in the tires, something else is going to happen.
[02:49:27.939 --> 02:49:31.441]  Iodine is necessary for thyroid function specifically.
[02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:34.042]  Thyroid is one of the master glands in the body.
[02:49:34.683 --> 02:49:43.527]  Thyroid metabolism is associated with virtually every single solitary metabolic system in the body.
[02:49:43.947 --> 02:49:48.850]  And if your thyroid is not functioning properly, nothing's going to be functioning properly.
[02:49:49.250 --> 02:49:52.932]  And in order for your thyroid to function properly, guess what?
[02:49:53.353 --> 02:49:54.393]  It needs iodine.
[02:49:54.793 --> 02:49:56.054]  It also needs selenium.
[02:49:56.615 --> 02:50:00.557]  Selenium and iodine, mandatory for proper thyroid function.
[02:50:00.917 --> 02:50:01.558]  And guess what?
[02:50:01.598 --> 02:50:04.459]  If your car runs out of oil, the engine seizes.
[02:50:04.559 --> 02:50:10.383]  Well, if your thyroid runs out of iodine, your entire body seizes.
[02:50:10.763 --> 02:50:13.305]  And so they put in the water and the food...
[02:50:14.045 --> 02:50:17.786]  The bad halogen that blocks, even if you have it, it can't get in there.
[02:50:18.366 --> 02:50:21.927]  And so again, that's one thing that's been life-changing for me, and you've heard the right reviews.
[02:50:22.327 --> 02:50:33.470]  Imagine Beyond Tangy Tangerine, organic, non-GMO, 2.0, from InfoWarsHealth.com, and you're fighting the tip of the spear in the info war, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:33.690 --> 02:50:39.131]  When we come back, I want to talk about what is in Beyond Tangy Tangerine with certified organic whole foods.
[02:50:39.531 --> 02:50:41.292]  I mean, it's got everything in it.
[02:50:41.832 --> 02:50:42.132]  Boom!
[02:50:43.052 --> 02:50:44.613]  A couple scoops today in water.
[02:50:45.853 --> 02:50:46.654]  Life-changing.
[02:50:47.314 --> 02:50:48.875]  Life-changing, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:49.355 --> 02:50:51.536]  And this is revolution against the globalists.
[02:50:51.877 --> 02:50:56.619]  They have jacked with our food, our water, on purpose and do not want us to have access to it.
[02:50:56.939 --> 02:51:01.281]  So you can fund the Infowar while getting a super high-quality product for you and your family.
[02:51:01.522 --> 02:51:05.744]  Just take the challenge at Infowarshealth.com or Infowarsteam.com.
[02:51:06.024 --> 02:51:09.706]  Try some of the products and you'll be amazed.
[02:51:10.186 --> 02:51:10.987]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:51:11.007 --> 02:51:12.488]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:12.788 --> 02:51:14.069]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:14.429 --> 02:51:16.770]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:17.271 --> 02:51:19.112]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:19.552 --> 02:51:23.595]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:51:24.075 --> 02:51:27.757]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:51:27.997 --> 02:51:31.460]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:51:31.780 --> 02:51:32.200]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:51:32.220 --> 02:51:33.841]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:51:39.229 --> 02:51:48.474]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:51:48.534 --> 02:51:49.274]  This capitalism?
[02:51:49.334 --> 02:51:55.438]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:55.498 --> 02:51:59.140]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:00.120]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:52:00.140 --> 02:52:01.461]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:52:01.521 --> 02:52:01.801]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:01.841 --> 02:52:02.121]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:52:09.165 --> 02:52:11.728]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[02:52:11.948 --> 02:52:16.574]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.

[02:52:28.766 --> 02:52:30.188]  There's only 500 of each.
[02:52:30.428 --> 02:52:34.532]  We're talking about Made in America belt buckles in nickel brass.
[02:52:34.612 --> 02:52:36.674]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[02:52:36.874 --> 02:52:39.777]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[02:52:39.977 --> 02:52:45.759]  But to expand the Info Orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free.

[02:53:14.361 --> 02:53:15.442]  We need assistance.
[02:53:15.802 --> 02:53:16.363]  Please!
[02:53:16.623 --> 02:53:19.925]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[02:53:20.225 --> 02:53:26.310]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:53:26.590 --> 02:53:28.952]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[02:53:55.389 --> 02:53:56.270]  Immediately.
[02:53:56.290 --> 02:54:00.675]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[02:54:01.076 --> 02:54:05.461]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com
[02:54:39.810 --> 02:54:43.617]  I tell you, the news is just getting crazier and crazier by the minute.
[02:54:43.698 --> 02:54:46.984]  We'll be covering it on the Nightly News tonight, seven o'clock central.
[02:54:48.673 --> 02:54:51.455]  And of course back tomorrow, Lord willing, live 11 a.m.
[02:54:51.475 --> 02:54:51.855]  to 2 p.m.
[02:54:51.895 --> 02:54:55.937]  Central with the daytime radio show slash TV.
[02:54:57.278 --> 02:55:01.760]  The articles up on InfoWars.com are again pretty amazing.
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:06.342]  All the different things that are unfolding and taking place right now.
[02:55:06.802 --> 02:55:12.786]  Brazen smugglers threaten journalists while operating in broad daylight and
[02:55:14.531 --> 02:55:21.314]  We've got our reporters, Don Salazar and others, down there on the border right now investigating all of this.
[02:55:21.374 --> 02:55:24.335]  It is just wide open with their boats and the rest of it.
[02:55:25.616 --> 02:55:31.578]  Again, a pervert gets his kicks by dressing up as a TSA screener and groping women at San Francisco Airport.
[02:55:31.919 --> 02:55:34.780]  Bickhams didn't even realize that it was a drunk man, was an imposter.
[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:42.743]  They've got a report out today that Rupert Murdoch, the deal of a lifetime, goes big for Time Warner, looking at buying it.
[02:55:44.366 --> 02:55:46.227]  The exec dropped the bombshell over lunch.
[02:55:47.548 --> 02:55:55.755]  Also, we've got other reports the military could use brain scanners to predict enemies' thoughts, but they can't find out why diabetes is exploding.
[02:55:57.736 --> 02:56:01.980]  And now Al-Qaeda magazine, Inspire, suggests attack on U.S.
[02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:02.560]  Open.
[02:56:03.401 --> 02:56:05.803]  Yes, after being given all those Stinger missiles, I bet.
[02:56:06.653 --> 02:56:12.297]  And Edward Snowden says the NSA employees pass around nude photos of people they're spying on.
[02:56:12.317 --> 02:56:13.358]  Yeah, that's come out before.
[02:56:14.178 --> 02:56:18.141]  Dr. Peter Glidden, in closing on the time we have here today.
[02:56:19.833 --> 02:56:24.155]  It really is incredible what proper nutrition can do.
[02:56:24.255 --> 02:56:31.198]  And as you said, even if you're eating organic, almost all of it is in soils that have been depleted because we're not using potash and things anymore.
[02:56:31.218 --> 02:56:32.999]  And it's really so simple.
[02:56:33.039 --> 02:56:34.259]  It's a huge piece of the puzzle.
[02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:37.441]  And the word is spreading about it.
[02:56:38.061 --> 02:56:57.995]  And I think as things get worse and worse, it's going to force people to go out and do the research that it takes to begin to get out of this mainline medical model, especially as MD healthcare, which has got a lot of good people in it, goes eugenics, where now the doctors have no say, and it's all pre-programmed by the federal computers.
[02:56:58.455 --> 02:57:03.018]  I mean, that's why so many medical doctors, up to a third of them, are quitting right now, including my dad.
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:07.443]  He's a doctor of oral surgery and of dental medicine.
[02:57:07.944 --> 02:57:09.906]  And for the folks who don't know, that's in the MD category.
[02:57:10.167 --> 02:57:14.973]  But across the board, they're leaving in an exodus because a bad system is being wrecked even worse.
[02:57:17.168 --> 02:57:24.337]  Things are bad, Alex, all over, but we have solutions that have been developed and delivered by licensed physicians trained in medical nutrition.
[02:57:25.037 --> 02:57:27.540]  Dr. Wallach's done all the heavy lifting.
[02:57:27.641 --> 02:57:35.850]  Go to InfoWarsTeam.com, check out the shopping cart, and get on board with an appropriate healthy start pack.
[02:57:36.531 --> 02:57:42.917]  We have healthy packs for bone support, healthy packs for digestive support, healthy packs for brain and heart pack.
[02:57:43.397 --> 02:57:47.280]  It's necessary to feed your body the stuff it needs to fix itself.
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:49.902]  You have no idea what you're missing.
[02:57:50.043 --> 02:57:54.766]  And if you get my book for free, it'll tell you how to do it and why.
[02:57:55.567 --> 02:57:56.088]  Absolutely.
[02:57:56.108 --> 02:58:07.816]  And if you want to order or have any questions about InfoWarsHealth.com or InfoWarsTeam.com, 888-789-9277.

[02:58:49.958 --> 02:58:51.118]  This is how we're doing it.
[02:58:51.458 --> 02:58:53.159]  Thank you so much, Dr. Glidden.
