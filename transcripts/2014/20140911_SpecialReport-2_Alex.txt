[00:00:01.727 --> 00:00:08.375]  I'm Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com, standing right off of Broadway here in Times Square, New York City.
[00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:16.824]  This is the epicenter of the terror threat that was posed by ISIS according to their online jihadi recruitment magazine.
[00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:22.611]  Now we were shocked to find out this morning that Mayor Bill de Blasio does not even have the security clearance
[00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:23.392]  We're good.
[00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:50.077]  So here we have a mayor that can't even protect his city because he doesn't want them to do a little bit of digging into his background to go ahead and get that security clearance.
[00:00:50.397 --> 00:00:54.299]  Now former mayor Michael Bloomberg does have security clearance.
[00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.162]  He is able to access classified information and he's also able to continue to access
[00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:05.786]  The funds that are meant for the victims and the families of the September 11th terror attacks.
[00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:14.992]  Now, Mayor Bloomberg has always been in charge of the September 11th ceremonies for the last 13 years, ever since those towers were toppled so long ago.
[00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:28.322]  But before he left office, he passed that honor over to the National September 11th Memorial Museum and World Trade Center Foundation, of which he is the foundation's chairman.
[00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:34.786]  That means he is in control of all of those funds that funnel in when people visit the museum.
[00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:45.074]  Everyone that has to pay $25 to visit that museum, all the memorabilia that they buy, even the family members have to pay $25 when they go and visit the museum.
[00:01:45.374 --> 00:01:46.715]  That's like asking a parent to
[00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:53.202]  Now, why is this so offensive and frightening?
[00:01:53.582 --> 00:02:00.910]  Well, we know that Bloomberg is the ultimate nanny and he has his pet project agenda, like taking away your Second Amendment right.
[00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.252]  It's not just banning the size of sodas you can drink.
[00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:08.557]  He wants to take away Americans, and definitely New Yorkers, Second Amendment right.
[00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:09.859]  Now, why is this frightening?
[00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:22.713]  According to this article that was originally posted by the Washington Times in 2001, the September 11th Fund united way, giving donations to leftist causes.
[00:02:23.093 --> 00:02:37.377]  One of the largest relief funds that was set up to help the victims of the September 11th attacks has awarded grants totaling more than a million dollars to a variety of left-wing political groups that are devoted to causes like hate crime legislation, expanded welfare, gun control,
[00:02:37.697 --> 00:02:38.218]  We're good to go.
[00:02:59.676 --> 00:02:59.876]  I think?
[00:03:16.184 --> 00:03:37.420]  Funneling that money out of the funds that were supposed to go to the victims and families and the first responders there following the September 11 terror attacks into their leftist ideological political groups political causes and that is exactly What mayor former mayor Bloomberg could do with the funds that are supposed to go to the victims families?
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.823]  so once again the victims families are going to be
[00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:45.977]  Screwed over in order to take your Second Amendment right.
[00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:49.304]  If United Way could do it, Bloomberg could too.
[00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:51.849]  For InfoWars.com, I'm Leanne McAdoo.
