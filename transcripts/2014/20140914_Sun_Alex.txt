[00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:22.884]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:24.705]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.908]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:40.500]  Welcome, welcome, welcome everyone out there listening to my voice.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.401]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:45.284]  We're gonna be here live for the next two hours till 4 p.m.
[00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:45.644]  Central.
[00:00:45.904 --> 00:00:48.907]  You can catch us every day during the week 11 a.m.
[00:00:49.247 --> 00:00:49.967]  to 2 p.m.
[00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:50.448]  Central.
[00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:52.604]  And it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:52.644 --> 00:00:55.545]  I'm your host Rob Doo, and we've got quite a show for you.
[00:00:55.685 --> 00:01:01.607]  Next segment we're going to have Paul Watson coming in through Skype, the magic of Skype, from across the river.
[00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:02.647]  We're going to be talking about Ebola.
[00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:12.370]  I have a whole plethora of information on Ebola that we're going to be covering, from the government's preparation that they're not telling you about, to the fact that they've known this thing could be airborne.
[00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.231]  And for at least 25 years they've known this.
[00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:17.793]  Now we're going to go over all that coming up.
[00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:19.254]  We've got quite a show for you.
[00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:21.376]  We're going to be covering the latest ISIS news.
[00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:27.382]  If you don't know, ISIS has released a third professional quality beheading video.
[00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:30.345]  This guy is a Brit.
[00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.017]  We're going to be covering that and what it means.
[00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:40.439]  They've released tons of videos before of them capturing Syrians and Iraqis and cutting their heads off and decapitating them.
[00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.761]  But these videos that really don't show any of the brutal carnage of it seem to really hit home with the American public and the government.
[00:01:49.502 --> 00:01:51.382]  There's the article today on Infowars.com.
[00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:52.442]  There's yesterday's video.
[00:01:52.522 --> 00:01:54.543]  ISIS reportedly beheads a British aid worker.
[00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.290]  And then they bring up another one, saying they're going to do him next.
[00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.552]  In Ebola news, we have four doctors now in the United States who two have recovered.
[00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.493]  One's in Atlanta, one's up in Nebraska.
[00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:12.114]  So they're importing this stuff everywhere, just as Alex Jones predicted.
[00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:15.755]  They're going to be importing Ebola all into the United States.
[00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:19.917]  And they're literally flushing the waste down the toilet into the public sewer system.
[00:02:19.937 --> 00:02:20.857]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:02:21.797 --> 00:02:23.238]  In addition to ISIS, we've got
[00:02:24.793 --> 00:02:27.656]  A little bit of NFL news I might cover.
[00:02:29.978 --> 00:02:35.023]  We've got both sides of the aisle coming back with ISIS saying, we gotta attack, we gotta attack.
[00:02:35.283 --> 00:02:37.205]  So this is both sides ramping up for war.
[00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:38.746]  You've got it in Britain.
[00:02:39.587 --> 00:02:43.030]  People who were normally for individual sovereignty and freedom.
[00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:48.595]  People like Nigel Farage are now saying we have to give up our liberty for security.
[00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:53.099]  And that's going to be the call as we march towards this global New World Order.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.540]  Like I said, I'm Rob Dew.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.143]  This is my first time to be hosting the show like this.
[00:02:57.263 --> 00:02:59.024]  I'm very honored to be doing it.
[00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:02.047]  Just a quick, quick bio about myself.
[00:03:02.788 --> 00:03:04.790]  I've always been a person that's liked to look behind the curtain.
[00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:09.360]  And back when I was in college, I picked up these two books here.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.322]  One's None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen.
[00:03:14.123 --> 00:03:15.503]  And the other one is Who Runs Congress?
[00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:18.465]  And that was from the Ralph Nader Congress Project.
[00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:31.533]  Both books were instrumental in my waking up to what's really going on, not the left-right paradigm that most people are caught in, but to the global crime syndicate and how it operates here in America.
[00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:33.454]  And it operates worldwide.
[00:03:33.794 --> 00:03:35.715]  It's not just here that it's operating.
[00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:36.916]  It's going all over the place.
[00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:39.097]  We're going to have quite a show for you today.
[00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:41.538]  Like I said, Paul Watson is going to be coming up in the next hour.
[00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:46.781]  And if anybody knows about Ebola and where it's going, it's Paul Watson.
[00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:49.062]  He's been on this since the beginning.
[00:03:49.702 --> 00:03:56.766]  We've been writing articles about Ebola for a long time here at InfoWars.com, trying to show the progression of this.
[00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:01.109]  And one thing I want to go to here in a second is this video model
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.001]  That has been coming out.
[00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:06.203]  It came out on the 10th of September.
[00:04:06.243 --> 00:04:08.424]  There's a video model showing how it would spread.
[00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:11.466]  And now they're saying it's going to kill about 5 million people.
[00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:18.030]  Well, in this model, and you guys can bring it up anytime, if you're watching on PrisonPlanetTV.tv, you can see it.
[00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.371]  It starts in Africa.
[00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:24.594]  When it comes over to our hemisphere, it starts in Cuba.
[00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:27.916]  And it's interesting that Cuba has just sent a bunch of doctors to go help.
[00:04:28.516 --> 00:04:29.557]  And then it moves into Florida.
[00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:32.897]  And then into the United States, through Miami.
[00:04:34.338 --> 00:04:42.703]  So that's very interesting how this model took into account all this stuff, and it's really looking at... It's pretty scary how this stuff is all going to spread.
[00:04:43.504 --> 00:04:44.825]  And we're going to be right back.
[00:04:45.425 --> 00:04:46.046]  One minute break.
[00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:47.106]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[00:04:47.126 --> 00:04:53.010]  We're going to be back with Paul Joseph Watson, talking about Ebola and a whole host of issues that you should be concerned about.
[00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.771]  So call your friends.
[00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:54.591]  Get ready.
[00:04:54.612 --> 00:04:55.252]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:56.233]  It's going to be two more hours.
[00:04:57.393 --> 00:04:57.934]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:17.319]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:19.581]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:24.866]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:05:25.026 --> 00:05:30.090]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.253]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:05:33.513 --> 00:05:37.376]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:41.819]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:51.925]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:54.667]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs.
[00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:58.410]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.880]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.341]  We're going to be here until 4 p.m.
[00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:44.741]  Central.
[00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:52.044]  You can find us at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com forward slash show if you want to watch our free live video feed.
[00:06:52.064 --> 00:06:56.806]  We're going to have some video clips here that you are going to want to see if you are near a computer.
[00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:58.507]  Call your friends, let them know to tune in.
[00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:08.831]  And we have on the line via Skype over across in England, it's Paul Joseph Watson, writer of PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com and
[00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:11.844]  Somewhat of a video star now.
[00:07:11.904 --> 00:07:15.129]  He's making his own videos, putting them out there, putting the information out there.
[00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.833]  And let me tell you, if the future is...
[00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:25.300]  If I can gain anything from watching my children, they love to watch little videos on YouTube.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.503]  That is the way we're going to wake up a lot of people.
[00:07:28.143 --> 00:07:30.646]  And my kids bring me stuff all the time and show it to me.
[00:07:30.786 --> 00:07:36.332]  Because once you've implanted the seeds of freedom and liberty, there's no stopping it.
[00:07:36.352 --> 00:07:37.713]  And that's all we have to do is plant a seed.
[00:07:37.853 --> 00:07:38.674]  That's our job here.
[00:07:38.694 --> 00:07:39.916]  And that's what we do here.
[00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:40.917]  Paul, how are you doing today?
[00:07:42.025 --> 00:07:42.505]  Good, Rob.
[00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:43.706]  Good to be on the air with you today.
[00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:44.327]  All right.
[00:07:44.687 --> 00:07:45.888]  Well, let's get right into Ebola.
[00:07:47.028 --> 00:07:49.950]  We've got four doctors now killed in Sierra Leone.
[00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.312]  We've got four doctors that we brought here into the United States.
[00:07:54.653 --> 00:07:55.434]  Where's all this going?
[00:07:57.335 --> 00:08:11.251]  Well, it's going towards hopefully answering the question which I've had since the very beginning when this started and when I started writing articles and making videos about it, which is why are all these health workers being infected with Ebola?
[00:08:11.671 --> 00:08:17.018]  Of course, we're told that this strain, which is a new strain of the virus, can only be contracted by
[00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:24.741]  Um, exchanging bodily fluids, so the health workers actually touching the bodily fluids of the Ebola victims.
[00:08:24.781 --> 00:08:28.862]  Now, you've seen the hazmat suits that they wear, the precautions that they take.
[00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:32.144]  Obviously they go to extreme measures to prevent that from happening.
[00:08:32.564 --> 00:08:39.427]  Not just the doctors in Africa, but the American doctors who have taken the same precautions and still caught the virus.
[00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:42.828]  So now, the WHO, for example, reports today
[00:08:43.508 --> 00:08:44.429]  Or a couple of days ago.
[00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:47.912]  Unprecedented number of medical staff infected with Ebola.
[00:08:48.172 --> 00:08:56.639]  The outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa is unprecedented in many ways, including the high proportion of doctors, nurses and other health workers who have been infected.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:06.267]  So 240 health workers in these West African countries, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, have been infected with Ebola and more than 120 have died.
[00:09:07.768 --> 00:09:17.130]  So again, this raises the question, if they're taking all these precautions to prevent the exchange of bodily fluid to catch the virus, then why are they contracting Ebola?
[00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:24.451]  Unless this new strain of Ebola may, at least to a limited extent, have gone airborne.
[00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:32.453]  Because we know the 2012 study, which we cited many times from Canada, they took pigs who were infected with Ebola
[00:09:33.353 --> 00:09:41.039]  Put them in a pen with monkeys that were separated by a wire fence, so no direct contact between the two species.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:49.106]  And basically what happened, most of the monkeys contracted Ebola via the respiratory system and died from it, and that was back in 2012.
[00:09:49.566 --> 00:09:56.772]  So they proved back then that Ebola had gone airborne between these two species, at least to a limited degree.
[00:09:57.372 --> 00:09:57.913]  So now
[00:09:59.013 --> 00:10:02.114]  As far back as six weeks ago we were asking the same question.
[00:10:02.514 --> 00:10:05.135]  We were called conspiracy theorists for doing so.
[00:10:06.015 --> 00:10:20.059]  I appeared on CBS radio with Dick Morris on August 6 last month and then a couple of days after that CBS local news came out with a story saying conspiracy theorists claims Ebola may be airborne.
[00:10:20.859 --> 00:10:44.382]  Which is interesting because as of two days ago, Michael Osterholm, who is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, wrote this big op-ed in the New York Times in which he said that basically health workers and experts are loathe to consider, they fear even considering the fact that, quote, Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.
[00:10:44.842 --> 00:10:50.583]  So now, six weeks after we first talked about it, we're getting top experts saying the same thing.
[00:10:50.963 --> 00:10:53.524]  We were called conspiracy theorists at the time for saying this.
[00:10:54.064 --> 00:11:02.566]  Now, top experts, doctors, medical professionals are starting to ask the same question, which is, has this new strain of Ebola gone airborne?
[00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:06.527]  Because it's unprecedented in the amount of people that it has infected.
[00:11:06.587 --> 00:11:08.147]  In fact, Michael Osterholm said that
[00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:13.989]  Quote, the current Ebola virus' hyper-evolution is unprecedented.
[00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:20.873]  There has been more human-to-human transmission in the past four months than likely occurred in the last 500 to 1,000 years.
[00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:25.155]  Each new infection represents trillions of throws of the genetic dice.
[00:11:25.795 --> 00:11:32.378]  So this is completely unprecedented, which is why we're asking the question, has it gone airborne at least to a limited extent?
[00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:43.548]  Well, Paul, before you go any farther, we've got a video clip that I found over the weekend, one of our excellent tipsters, and we've got so many tipsters out there that just send us tip after tip after tip.
[00:11:44.048 --> 00:11:57.637]  This one is from a NOVA program that aired in the mid-90s, but it talks about an incident that happened in 1989 here in Virginia, and it's between air transmission of Ebola between monkeys.
[00:11:58.198 --> 00:11:59.058]  And you guys got that clip?
[00:11:59.539 --> 00:11:59.999]  Let's roll it.
[00:12:01.665 --> 00:12:04.747]  In 1989, Ebola made its way to the U.S.
[00:12:05.488 --> 00:12:07.429]  Residents of this Washington, D.C.
[00:12:07.489 --> 00:12:12.673]  suburb had no idea that one of the world's deadliest viruses had emerged in their midst.
[00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:26.563]  In a primate quarantine unit in Reston, Virginia, monkeys in one of the holding rooms suddenly began to die.
[00:12:27.978 --> 00:12:34.960]  Secretly, a military team entered the quarantine unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room.
[00:12:45.503 --> 00:12:49.345]  The crisis heightened as monkeys began to die in a different room.
[00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:53.866]  It appeared that the virus was moving through the ventilating system.
[00:12:55.308 --> 00:13:01.469]  In response, the military killed all 400 monkeys, ending the outbreak.
[00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.390]  This new strain of Ebola had shown the potential to spread through the air.
[00:13:07.071 --> 00:13:10.911]  Had it been lethal in humans, it could have been catastrophic.
[00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:12.732]  There you go, Paul.
[00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:17.673]  So, they've been... This has been on the radar since 1989, at least with the military.
[00:13:18.113 --> 00:13:20.173]  Secretly, because no one else knew about it.
[00:13:20.193 --> 00:13:22.234]  I mean, what do you have to say about that?
[00:13:23.732 --> 00:13:52.581]  Well that's amazing of course because I mean we had the Canadian study but that was only from two years ago so to hear that it's you know at least one strain between two species of monkeys has been airborne since 1989 is again is shocking and this is what I've said over and over again you know I can talk about this until I'm blue in the face I'm just a journalist I'm just writing about it I'm not an expert on it we need actual experts and infectious disease specialists to be looking into this possibility because it seems like it
[00:13:53.141 --> 00:14:13.070]  It could be a good explanation for the aggressiveness of how this virus has spread, but as Osterholm said in the New York Times the other day, they're kind of scared of yelling fire in a crowded theatre because they think that it's going to cause hysteria and mass panic, which is interesting because, you know, the pharmaceutical industry
[00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:29.736]  Normally loves hysteria and mass panic because it sells drugs and it sells vaccines, which is what we saw in 2009 with the swine flu outbreak, which was very different, of course, because they already had the vaccine lined up and they created a huge, huge scare.
[00:14:29.776 --> 00:14:35.698]  I mean, at the time that there was talk of troops on the streets and martial law, and this was in the newspapers every day.
[00:14:36.378 --> 00:14:38.199]  And they had the vaccine lined up.
[00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:43.363]  Probably millions of people globally took the vaccine, which was completely unnecessary.
[00:14:43.903 --> 00:14:48.446]  Swine flu was only really a danger to sick people, young people and the elderly.
[00:14:48.486 --> 00:14:53.129]  So the majority of the global population was under no risk whatsoever.
[00:14:53.969 --> 00:15:12.792]  They sold this drug in huge quantities and it was engendered off the back of hysteria created by governments and the pharmaceutical industry, which we're not seeing in this case because they've been very slow to develop a vaccine or a drug to treat Ebola, which many people have suggested is because
[00:15:13.653 --> 00:15:20.819]  You know, basically people don't give a damn about black people in Africa dying from this and it's kind of, there's no profit in it.
[00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:30.986]  In fact, we've seen top experts come out and admit, Dr. Ben Newman said, I think it was to Bloomberg, quote, there isn't enough panic to justify a cure.
[00:15:31.527 --> 00:15:36.050]  So there's not enough money in it to justify intense research into vaccines and drugs.
[00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.772]  So basically they're just going to let it proliferate.
[00:15:38.812 --> 00:15:39.413]  And now we've got
[00:15:40.093 --> 00:15:47.202]  Other experts, as I reported on Friday, and this was quite a bizarre story, because they changed the story after we reported it.
[00:15:47.263 --> 00:15:53.070]  This was Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernag-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg.
[00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:58.577]  He told Deutsch Well that it would kill 5 million people, and we can get into that after the break.
[00:15:58.757 --> 00:15:59.158]  That's right.
[00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:00.180]  We'll get right back to that.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.767]  And we do have somebody developing a vaccine with the help of the Gates Foundation.
[00:16:03.827 --> 00:16:04.288]  Don't worry.
[00:16:04.348 --> 00:16:05.330]  They're going to come save us.
[00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.373]  And we're going to have all that right after the break.
[00:16:07.394 --> 00:16:09.337]  It's Infowars.com and the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:09.357 --> 00:16:10.039]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:11.431 --> 00:16:14.933]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:16:15.093 --> 00:16:19.056]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:16:19.356 --> 00:16:20.817]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:16:21.137 --> 00:16:28.742]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:16:29.002 --> 00:16:29.863]  But for how long?
[00:16:30.143 --> 00:16:36.407]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:39.609]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:16:40.984 --> 00:16:45.326]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:16:45.626 --> 00:16:50.269]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.409]  Talk about the effects.
[00:16:51.729 --> 00:16:53.210]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.831]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:16:55.151 --> 00:16:56.212]  I feel like I look better.
[00:16:56.272 --> 00:16:56.912]  I feel better.
[00:16:56.972 --> 00:16:58.013]  I feel sexier.
[00:16:58.033 --> 00:16:58.773]  I love it.
[00:16:59.013 --> 00:17:01.935]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:17:01.995 --> 00:17:04.736]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:17:04.936 --> 00:17:05.957]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:17:06.017 --> 00:17:07.037]  Consult your physician.

[00:17:09.398 --> 00:17:10.499]  This is life changing.
[00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:12.240]  Another major health threat.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.184]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:17:17.264 --> 00:17:19.886]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:17:19.926 --> 00:17:26.712]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:17:26.972 --> 00:17:29.834]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:17:29.955 --> 00:17:32.897]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:17:32.917 --> 00:17:34.919]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:17:34.939 --> 00:17:37.781]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:43.364]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:17:43.585 --> 00:17:47.067]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:17:47.087 --> 00:17:50.069]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:17:50.189 --> 00:17:57.273]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:18:10.863 --> 00:18:19.373]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:18:19.553 --> 00:18:25.761]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:29.805]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[00:18:30.045 --> 00:18:31.406]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:19:16.829 --> 00:19:17.329]  Security alert.
[00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:18.690]  Security alert.
[00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.632]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:19:20.892 --> 00:19:24.455]  Analysis, InfoWars, building indexes, media operations.

[00:19:27.398 --> 00:19:29.440]  We are the ones responsible.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.400]  Prime Directive.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.861]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:34.884]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:19:34.904 --> 00:19:37.946]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:40.368]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:19:40.448 --> 00:19:41.969]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:44.371]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:46.492]  They are never going to stop.
[00:19:46.772 --> 00:19:50.715]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:19:58.741 --> 00:20:00.723]  Destroy Britain's T.V.
[00:20:00.763 --> 00:20:05.186]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[00:20:05.486 --> 00:20:07.668]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[00:20:12.151 --> 00:20:13.312]  Coast to Coast.
[00:20:13.692 --> 00:20:14.993]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:15.734 --> 00:20:18.936]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:26.747 --> 00:20:28.909]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:31.710]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:34.412]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:37.574 --> 00:20:43.638]  A leading German virologist claims it's too late.
[00:20:43.938 --> 00:20:46.600]  Ebola's gonna kill 5 million people.
[00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:47.721]  At least.
[00:20:50.263 --> 00:20:53.585]  West African health centers cannot keep up with the Ebola outbreak.
[00:20:54.642 --> 00:20:59.223]  Ebola outplaces global response, the World Health Organization says.
[00:21:00.464 --> 00:21:04.865]  But don't worry, we've got Bill Gates coming to the rescue.
[00:21:04.925 --> 00:21:07.165]  He's going to give $50 million to fight Ebola.
[00:21:07.185 --> 00:21:15.028]  Then we have GlaxoSmithKline, who has a vaccine that's been fast-tracked for clinical trials.
[00:21:16.868 --> 00:21:17.848]  GlaxoSmithKline.
[00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:19.929]  These are the same people that in 2012 were fined
[00:21:24.525 --> 00:21:31.129]  Only 400,000 pesos for killing 14 babies in Argentina for tests they did on an ammonia vaccine.
[00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:39.835]  So I guess we can all be assured that since it's GlaxoSmithKline, they're going to do good at making this Ebola vaccine.
[00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:43.357]  And one more thing.
[00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:46.338]  Paul, did you see this?
[00:21:46.438 --> 00:22:02.581]  Over the weekend, this was published on September 12th, Lakeland Industries announces global availability of hazmat suits for Ebola, and the President and Chief, the CEO of Lakeland Industries came out and said that the State Department had put in a bid for 160,000 suits.
[00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:11.143]  The State Department is getting 160,000 hazmat suits to protect from something that now might even be going airborne.
[00:22:11.903 --> 00:22:13.343]  Paul, what do you make of all this madness?
[00:22:15.117 --> 00:22:16.719]  Well, it's interesting, isn't it?
[00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:21.825]  I mean, 160,000 suits, and it's the State Department that's making the purchase.
[00:22:21.865 --> 00:22:27.271]  You would think that it would be the CDC, but that suggests it's some kind of national security issue.
[00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:30.334]  Or a health aid organization that's going to send people to Africa.
[00:22:30.395 --> 00:22:32.177]  No, it's the State Department.
[00:22:32.845 --> 00:22:33.285]  Exactly.
[00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:53.358]  I mean, that's concerning and it ties into what we've reported before, which of course, probably about six weeks ago, Obama signed this amendment to an executive order, which was originally signed by Bush to deal with SARS, to detain, forcibly detain Americans who show signs of respiratory illness, merely signs of respiratory illness.
[00:22:53.799 --> 00:22:56.941]  Then we already had the CDC measures which were in place before that.
[00:22:57.481 --> 00:23:03.825]  Which allowed for the quarantine of, quote, well persons who, quote, do not show symptoms of the disease.
[00:23:04.405 --> 00:23:07.487]  So again, it's this medical martial law scenario.
[00:23:07.827 --> 00:23:16.433]  You've also got the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, which the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons warned could turn governors into dictators.
[00:23:16.793 --> 00:23:17.614]  That's another quote.
[00:23:18.074 --> 00:23:25.679]  So you've got this system that's already inbuilt and ingrained, ready to be turned on in the case of a pandemic of this nature.
[00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.220]  Yeah, that's of concern.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:36.565]  The State Department buying 160,000 hazmat suits with this Ebola virus raging with speculation that it may have gone airborne.
[00:23:37.066 --> 00:23:38.807]  So it's of extreme concern.
[00:23:38.827 --> 00:23:43.710]  And then you mentioned Bill Gates, which reminded me of the whole eugenics angle.
[00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:56.664]  Dr. Charles Arntzen, head of the Biodesign Institute for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, and he was one of the guys who worked on the experimental Ebola treatment which the two Americans who flew into Atlanta received.
[00:23:57.225 --> 00:24:00.749]  He joked at a conference, I believe it was a couple of years ago,
[00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:09.375]  The key to solving overpopulation was to create a genetically engineered virus that could kill 2 billion people.
[00:24:10.236 --> 00:24:17.381]  And these are the people that are creating the very vaccines which are going to be doled out to people if this hysteria gets any bigger.
[00:24:17.421 --> 00:24:29.209]  And he's joking about, oh, we need a genetically engineered virus to kill 2 billion people to solve overpopulation, which we know is a complete statistical lie if you actually delve down into the figures.
[00:24:29.429 --> 00:24:31.751]  Right.
[00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:38.355]  Bill Gates has gone on television with TED TV putting his little equation up there that says one of these things has to go to zero.
[00:24:39.616 --> 00:24:41.518]  And it's people that are going to go to zero.
[00:24:41.558 --> 00:24:42.518]  That's what he wants to see.
[00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:44.640]  I mean it's that's it.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.461]  I mean Bill Gates is a eugenicist.
[00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:51.525]  His dad was part of Planned Parenthood and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree it would seem.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:25:00.382]  But here's another interesting fact that these patients we're bringing in to the United States, these doctors, they're just flushing the waste down the toilet.
[00:25:00.842 --> 00:25:06.624]  Atlanta's news agencies have revealed that Ebola's patient waste, including feces and urine, are going into the city's public sewer system.
[00:25:07.604 --> 00:25:13.986]  They say there's no risk of infection to the general public because their waste management practices will kill any viruses flushed into the system.
[00:25:15.206 --> 00:25:17.347]  Does that make you feel, does that make you feel any safer?
[00:25:18.322 --> 00:25:19.183]  What if a pipe burst?
[00:25:48.602 --> 00:25:54.004]  So why was there even a need to put anybody at risk by bringing them into Atlanta?
[00:25:54.424 --> 00:26:05.967]  Some of the speculation was centered around the fact that the CDC had a patent on a strain of Ebola and a vaccine already ready for it, so that was why they were bringing them into the country.
[00:26:06.007 --> 00:26:17.411]  I'm not sure about that, but even the top infectious disease specialists have questioned why they need to bring them into America in the first place, when you can treat them with the exact same drug in Africa.
[00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:30.639]  Remember SARS patients were brought into Canada from Asia in 2003 and they ended up infecting 400 people and killing 44 people as a result because they brought them into the country when it wasn't necessary.
[00:26:30.699 --> 00:26:33.321]  So it really doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:26:34.062 --> 00:26:46.550]  And if you don't believe, Paul, that the CDC has an actual patent on Ebola, there's a global research article from August 6th that I'm bringing up on my computer over here that you guys can pull up.
[00:26:47.578 --> 00:26:47.778]  Uh, yeah.
[00:26:47.838 --> 00:26:49.259]  Weapon of Mass Destruction.
[00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:52.920]  And, um... Oh, that might not even be the article.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.102]  This article is why... It's a different article, actually, from August 3rd.
[00:26:56.722 --> 00:26:58.303]  And, uh, why do the U.S.
[00:26:58.343 --> 00:27:00.784]  Centers for Disease Control own a patent on Ebola?
[00:27:00.804 --> 00:27:04.505]  And it's called EbolaBUN, and I'm even going to give you the patent number, if you don't believe me.
[00:27:04.565 --> 00:27:05.066]  It's CA2741523A1.
[00:27:05.086 --> 00:27:08.787]  There's the patent number right there, and it was awarded in 2010.
[00:27:09.788 --> 00:27:10.088]  There you go.
[00:27:16.511 --> 00:27:17.392]  Very interesting.
[00:27:17.452 --> 00:27:19.515]  So the CDC owns the patent on it.
[00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:23.619]  Maybe they wanted to see if this was their strain of Ebola that's out there.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:36.353]  And another thing people don't seem to be too concerned about, if they decide to crack down and round people up and do this with grabbing
[00:27:37.796 --> 00:27:38.276]  It's like this.
[00:27:38.917 --> 00:27:50.873]  When I was in Chicago, we were accompanying the National Guard who were doing hazmat, recovery, rescue operations for a biological pandemic that had happened.
[00:27:51.073 --> 00:27:52.615]  They were also going after gun owners.
[00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:54.811]  Which they were calling terrorists.
[00:27:55.591 --> 00:28:00.854]  But they were going after these people, and one of the exercises they had was taking place at a sports stadium.
[00:28:01.514 --> 00:28:03.195]  And there are sports stadiums all over the country.
[00:28:03.235 --> 00:28:05.496]  You've got high school, you've got college, you've got professional.
[00:28:05.996 --> 00:28:07.857]  You've got plenty of sports stadiums in this country.
[00:28:08.377 --> 00:28:15.481]  And they were going to use these stations as staging grounds, A, and also places to round people up, which we saw in Katrina with New Orleans.
[00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:17.142]  So this is not unprecedented.
[00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:20.684]  These are all over the place, and anytime they want to pull the trigger,
[00:28:21.704 --> 00:28:23.786]  And say, hey, come here if you want to get your vaccine.
[00:28:24.167 --> 00:28:24.787]  Bring it on in.
[00:28:25.088 --> 00:28:25.448]  Come on in.
[00:28:25.648 --> 00:28:26.669]  We got a place for you to stay.
[00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.131]  But then you're never going to get out.
[00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:30.914]  They didn't let those people out of the Superdome for almost a week.
[00:28:32.342 --> 00:28:39.690]  And that's where this stuff could go if it does get loose in the United States, which begs the question, why are we bringing these people in?
[00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:40.751]  Why not keep them offshore?
[00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:43.834]  Why not build a medical boat if you want to treat these people?
[00:28:44.334 --> 00:28:44.935]  Why not do that?
[00:28:45.435 --> 00:28:46.697]  A lot of questions going on with this.
[00:28:46.717 --> 00:28:49.319]  We're going to finish up with this in the next segment.
[00:28:49.339 --> 00:28:53.223]  We're also going to start taking your calls towards the end of this hour.
[00:28:53.543 --> 00:28:55.565]  And I'll give out that phone number in just a second.
[00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:58.968]  And we're going to be with you here until 6 p.m.
[00:28:59.009 --> 00:28:59.389]  Central.
[00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:00.450]  I made a mistake earlier.
[00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.950]  Sorry about that.
[00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:01.731]  6 p.m.
[00:29:01.771 --> 00:29:02.031]  Central.
[00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:03.112]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:03.132 --> 00:29:03.973]  I'm your host Rob Doo.
[00:29:04.253 --> 00:29:06.335]  Riding shotgun with me is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:10.018]  Their websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:11.858 --> 00:29:12.959]  Open your eyes.
[00:29:13.379 --> 00:29:16.301]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[00:29:16.801 --> 00:29:22.964]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[00:29:23.285 --> 00:29:31.269]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[00:29:31.629 --> 00:29:32.710]  Open your eyes.
[00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:48.040]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is the new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.
[00:29:48.601 --> 00:29:56.046]  Optimize the natural power of your eyes with the latest addition to the super high-quality InfoWars Life formulations, Occupower.
[00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:02.890]  888-253-3139.
[00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:03.311]  Occupower.
[00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:03.911]  Open your eyes.
[00:30:11.229 --> 00:30:20.755]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:30:20.895 --> 00:30:30.640]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.742]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:30:33.942 --> 00:30:34.562]  I think so.
[00:30:56.732 --> 00:30:59.173]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[00:30:59.193 --> 00:31:05.756]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[00:31:20.222 --> 00:31:22.823]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[00:31:23.003 --> 00:31:24.764]  If not, then I want to know why.
[00:31:24.944 --> 00:31:27.165]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[00:31:27.245 --> 00:31:31.467]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[00:31:31.727 --> 00:31:32.747]  I say, so what?
[00:31:32.887 --> 00:31:34.868]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[00:31:35.088 --> 00:31:38.209]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[00:31:38.469 --> 00:31:42.571]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[00:31:42.731 --> 00:31:47.093]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[00:31:47.333 --> 00:31:48.394]  And I'm still fighting.
[00:31:48.574 --> 00:31:51.595]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[00:31:51.795 --> 00:31:53.496]  The Info War is worldwide.
[00:31:53.616 --> 00:31:57.758]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:01.560]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented facts.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:08.743]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:32:08.903 --> 00:32:10.364]  The truth will set them free.
[00:32:11.434 --> 00:32:16.838]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:22.843]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:23.223 --> 00:32:30.008]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.111]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:32:34.832 --> 00:32:38.295]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:51.975]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:52.255 --> 00:32:53.756]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:54.036 --> 00:32:56.597]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:32:56.917 --> 00:33:00.979]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:03.180]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.741]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:33:06.241 --> 00:33:07.682]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:33:07.822 --> 00:33:08.262]  Got it.
[00:33:08.622 --> 00:33:09.103]  Others don't.
[00:33:12.065 --> 00:33:14.966]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:15.666 --> 00:33:19.768]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:29.352 --> 00:33:37.615]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:43.328 --> 00:33:44.349]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:46.230]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.192]  This is Sunday, September 14th, 2014.
[00:33:49.993 --> 00:33:52.955]  We are live about another hour and a half.
[00:33:54.396 --> 00:33:55.137]  I'm your host, Rob Duo.
[00:33:55.157 --> 00:33:59.901]  I'm joined with Paul Watson, writer of PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:34:02.461 --> 00:34:07.123]  If you don't know me, I'm the News Director over here, mainly for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:34:07.163 --> 00:34:12.866]  I run that crew, the reporters, keep them busy and send them out on missions.
[00:34:13.466 --> 00:34:18.788]  One of which, they just got back from New York during the 13th anniversary of 9-11.
[00:34:18.908 --> 00:34:20.589]  You guys can punch this up here.
[00:34:21.129 --> 00:34:23.611]  I want to show you two videos here on the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:34:23.651 --> 00:34:25.712]  This is something that I spend a lot of my time on.
[00:34:27.173 --> 00:34:29.615]  YouTube.com forward slash the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:34:29.635 --> 00:34:31.576]  We've got two videos right now that are going viral.
[00:34:32.057 --> 00:34:33.978]  One is from the Nightly News on Friday.
[00:34:34.478 --> 00:34:38.161]  And this is Darren McBreen's piece, Shocking Demonic Photos of Obama.
[00:34:38.201 --> 00:34:40.022]  And it shows him literally with devil horns.
[00:34:40.843 --> 00:34:41.483]  Really scary.
[00:34:42.004 --> 00:34:45.947]  And if you think that this is, oh well, he just happened to be set up that way.
[00:34:46.988 --> 00:34:51.237]  They pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure stuff like this doesn't occur.
[00:34:52.355 --> 00:34:55.578]  And they pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure stuff like this does occur.
[00:34:55.598 --> 00:34:57.299]  So let me tell you, that's a message right there.
[00:34:57.319 --> 00:34:59.020]  There's your demonic president.
[00:34:59.701 --> 00:35:05.065]  And the other one is 9-11 firefighter blows WTC7 cover-up wide open.
[00:35:05.085 --> 00:35:10.910]  That's an interview that Leon McAdoo did with firefighter Rudy Dent, who was off that day of 9-11.
[00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:16.555]  But after the towers collapsed, he raced over to his fire station.
[00:35:17.135 --> 00:35:18.857]  Him and his boys commandeered a mail truck.
[00:35:19.938 --> 00:35:24.884]  And went in there to help rescue people, and he actually saw explosions happening at WTC7.
[00:35:25.264 --> 00:35:32.512]  He saw molten metal, things that he cannot explain as a firefighter, and one of which is how the building collapsed.
[00:35:33.033 --> 00:35:34.575]  This doesn't happen regularly.
[00:35:35.456 --> 00:35:38.659]  In fact, the only time it's happened because of a fire is during 9-11.
[00:35:40.376 --> 00:35:43.918]  So you don't have to, don't beat me up about it.
[00:35:44.158 --> 00:35:46.218]  Go look at building structural integrity.
[00:35:46.319 --> 00:35:48.780]  Go look at office building fires that have happened.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:54.782]  There was a fire in Shanghai, China a few years ago that burned for over 24 hours and did not collapse into its own footprint.
[00:35:54.802 --> 00:35:56.263]  So that stuff just doesn't magically happen.
[00:35:57.022 --> 00:35:57.843]  It has to be planned.
[00:35:58.744 --> 00:36:01.907]  So that's an amazing interview with Rudy Dent.
[00:36:01.947 --> 00:36:05.730]  You can see that 9-11 firefighter blows WTC7 cover-up wide open.
[00:36:06.611 --> 00:36:09.554]  And we've got a few things on there, a few of our little playlists.
[00:36:09.614 --> 00:36:13.738]  You can see Joe Biggs crossing the Rio Grande in El Paso.
[00:36:14.479 --> 00:36:15.680]  Our adventures in Ferguson.
[00:36:16.241 --> 00:36:20.485]  Lots of stuff up there on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:36:21.556 --> 00:36:34.050]  But one way you can support us is by becoming a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, which we have all the same stuff that you see on the Alex Jones Channel, but you can download it, you can spread it around.
[00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:41.599]  We've got the day show, the nightly news, our special reports, we have some movies up there that Alex has made.
[00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.111]  Oh, dozens of documentaries.
[00:36:44.171 --> 00:36:57.641]  I helped make a couple of them, one of which is Police State for the Rise of FEMA, which I was a co-director on back in, we released that in 2010, and just an amazing wealth of information that you can access for just pennies a day.
[00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:03.111]  And you can use your username and password and share it with up to 11 people.
[00:37:03.831 --> 00:37:07.673]  You can have 11 of you on right now watching the show, watching the videos as we pull them up.
[00:37:07.693 --> 00:37:11.053]  Did you see the video that we showed from the NOVA presentation?
[00:37:11.954 --> 00:37:17.635]  Where they're talking about how this Ebola went airborne through the ventilation shaft?
[00:37:18.956 --> 00:37:21.476]  Okay, this stuff is happening right now.
[00:37:21.596 --> 00:37:23.397]  No one can explain how it's spreading.
[00:37:24.522 --> 00:37:26.266]  No one can explain how these doctors are getting sick.
[00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:28.530]  When these doctors go in there, they're wearing hazmat suits.
[00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.075]  They're spraying themselves down with Lysol and chlorine.
[00:37:32.162 --> 00:37:34.303]  There's no reason for this many doctors to be getting sick.
[00:37:34.323 --> 00:37:42.348]  We've just had our fourth doctor die in Sierra Leone and we've got four doctors here, two which have seemed to have recovered and two which are still sick.
[00:37:42.529 --> 00:37:45.230]  One in Atlanta and the other in Nebraska.
[00:37:45.911 --> 00:37:47.892]  So we've just brought it to the middle of the country.
[00:37:48.252 --> 00:37:48.753]  Why not?
[00:37:49.273 --> 00:37:51.014]  And they're flushing it all down the toilet.
[00:37:51.514 --> 00:37:53.195]  All the waste is going down the toilet.
[00:37:53.536 --> 00:37:56.518]  So I guess they think they've got it under control.
[00:37:57.921 --> 00:38:04.546]  Paul Watson, let's finish up on Ebola, and I want to play that clip again from the NOVA presentation in case people missed it, because we did play it earlier in the show.
[00:38:05.046 --> 00:38:09.229]  And I think people need to hear this, that they've known since 1989 that this thing can go airborne.
[00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.191]  So, how would you like to finish this up?
[00:38:13.854 --> 00:38:20.296]  Yeah, I just want to mention, I wrote a story on Friday about this German expert from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Hamburg.
[00:38:20.917 --> 00:38:24.838]  He basically gave some statements to Deutsche Welle, which is a major German publication.
[00:38:25.438 --> 00:38:35.662]  He said that the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone and Liberia would only burn itself out when it's infected the entire population of those two countries and killed five million people.
[00:38:36.063 --> 00:38:37.103]  And he basically said that
[00:38:37.623 --> 00:38:40.705]  All hope is lost for those two countries and that it's too late.
[00:38:41.125 --> 00:39:00.638]  What's weird about it is literally within an hour of me publishing that report on InfoWars and giving it a headline worthy of the quotes that were actually in the article about five million people dying, they changed not only the headline of the article but they removed the quotes from the article from this expert saying that
[00:39:01.498 --> 00:39:05.260]  5 million people would die in Africa as a result of Ebola.
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.580]  And there was no formal retraction.
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.121]  That's the thing.
[00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:14.583]  If you change a news article after the fact in such a major way, you know, this wasn't a spelling error or something.
[00:39:14.623 --> 00:39:16.564]  It was a major retraction.
[00:39:16.584 --> 00:39:19.025]  It was a change of the headline, removing quotes.
[00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:19.345]  That's right.
[00:39:19.365 --> 00:39:20.545]  You normally have to announce it.
[00:39:20.645 --> 00:39:22.466]  You put a note saying, hey, we made a mistake.
[00:39:22.506 --> 00:39:23.866]  He didn't actually say 5 million.
[00:39:23.886 --> 00:39:24.147]  He said 200,000.
[00:39:25.467 --> 00:39:27.349]  Which, they didn't put that as a retraction.
[00:39:27.489 --> 00:39:29.290]  They just left it, they just removed it.
[00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.613]  It was, I guess, a piece of 1984 jargon.
[00:39:33.753 --> 00:39:39.798]  And what's interesting is that they say this thing is going to double in about two weeks.
[00:39:40.158 --> 00:39:45.683]  So they say 20,000 people could be affected here by Friday, but then that's going to double.
[00:39:46.567 --> 00:39:51.490]  And this thing just keeps going on and on and on, and they have no way to really stop it.
[00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:57.933]  There's no supposed vaccine, if there will ever be a real vaccine, if it doesn't help spread it.
[00:39:58.494 --> 00:40:08.259]  I find it interesting too, that as soon, and I was watching this months ago, when it first started happening, the villagers that they were treating were attacking these medical centers.
[00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:10.941]  They were saying the doctors were helping spread this.
[00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:11.981]  They were accusing them of it.
[00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:12.862]  Now I don't know if they were.
[00:40:13.662 --> 00:40:16.824]  Or if it was just this case of them being superstitious.
[00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:23.509]  But I find that very interesting that the villagers were freaking out that these health workers were here and that the virus just kept getting worse and worse.
[00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.130]  Now, it could be a coincidence.
[00:40:26.051 --> 00:40:26.511]  It could be.
[00:40:26.731 --> 00:40:27.752]  But, I don't know.
[00:40:27.772 --> 00:40:28.693]  What do you think about that, Paul?
[00:40:30.433 --> 00:40:31.454]  I don't know, Rob.
[00:40:31.574 --> 00:40:32.155]  It's bizarre.
[00:40:32.175 --> 00:40:42.647]  There's also a story about a black market treatment for Ebola which is now circulating in Africa, which the WHO and the other health authorities are trying to clamp down on and eliminate.
[00:40:42.687 --> 00:40:45.910]  So there's obviously a lot of concern from people in Africa that
[00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:52.478]  If there is a treatment for this, which we know they've been working on it, that they're not getting proper access to it.
[00:40:52.518 --> 00:40:59.888]  So now they're having to go to the black market to try and get something which, I don't know, it may or may not work, but the WHO is keen to clamp down on it.
[00:41:00.468 --> 00:41:05.835]  So there's a lot of bizarre things going on behind the scenes and again with the media aspect, there's a lot of
[00:41:06.175 --> 00:41:07.616]  Massaging of the message.
[00:41:07.656 --> 00:41:17.484]  I mean, we know the CDC has been very reluctant to release any information on suspected Ebola sufferers in the United States and obviously that's the same in Germany and across the board.
[00:41:18.124 --> 00:41:32.235]  Also, I wanted to mention the advisory that the CDC put out to the airline staff to provide surgical masks to potential Ebola victims in order to quote, reduce the number of droplets expelled into the air by talking, sneezing or coughing.
[00:41:33.075 --> 00:41:37.839]  Um, not use compressed air, which might spread infectious material through the air.
[00:41:37.919 --> 00:41:42.502]  So, at least to some extent, they're also concerned about it spreading through the air.
[00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:46.645]  And this was an advisory that was put out months ago and is still in effect.
[00:41:46.705 --> 00:41:53.631]  So again, it goes back to the speculation of whether it's gone airborne and that it's not just contractible via exchange of bodily fluids.
[00:41:54.091 --> 00:42:03.518]  And we've got the video clip from the NOVA program in the 90s, talking about an 89 secret monkey eradication program that the United States government underwent.
[00:42:03.538 --> 00:42:06.000]  Let's go to that clip real quick.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.842]  In 1989, Ebola made its way to the U.S.
[00:42:09.602 --> 00:42:11.524]  Residents of this Washington, D.C.
[00:42:11.584 --> 00:42:16.748]  suburb had no idea that one of the world's deadliest viruses had emerged in their midst.
[00:42:23.317 --> 00:42:30.680]  In a primate quarantine unit in Reston, Virginia, monkeys in one of the holding rooms suddenly began to die.
[00:42:32.081 --> 00:42:39.023]  Secretly, a military team entered the quarantine unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room.
[00:42:49.588 --> 00:42:50.468]  The crisis heightened.
[00:42:51.064 --> 00:42:53.430]  As monkeys began to die in a different room.
[00:42:54.813 --> 00:42:57.961]  It appeared that the virus was moving through the ventilating system.
[00:42:59.384 --> 00:43:03.546]  In response, the military killed all 400 monkeys.
[00:43:03.886 --> 00:43:04.666]  There you go.
[00:43:04.947 --> 00:43:10.349]  The military was involved in covering up an airborne transmission of Ebola.
[00:43:10.369 --> 00:43:11.029]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:11.169 --> 00:43:19.693]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:43:19.853 --> 00:43:26.076]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:43:26.476 --> 00:43:31.740]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here, Survival Shield X2.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:44.490]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:51.615]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients.
[00:43:51.815 --> 00:43:52.836]  And completely vegan.
[00:43:52.956 --> 00:43:56.418]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 Iodine for radiation.
[00:43:56.618 --> 00:43:59.459]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:05.963]  X2 Nascent Iodine is available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:44:11.169 --> 00:44:17.233]  Daryl, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:44:17.273 --> 00:44:20.615]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:44:20.635 --> 00:44:22.316]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[00:44:22.336 --> 00:44:28.620]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:34.624]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the pants on the streets?
[00:44:34.784 --> 00:44:38.546]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:44:38.727 --> 00:44:41.608]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:44:41.628 --> 00:44:49.834]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:44:50.094 --> 00:44:52.135]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:44:52.195 --> 00:44:53.236]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:44:53.596 --> 00:45:02.340]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:45:15.441 --> 00:45:20.063]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:45:20.203 --> 00:45:21.224]  Talk about the effects.
[00:45:21.544 --> 00:45:23.024]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:45:23.044 --> 00:45:24.645]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:45:24.965 --> 00:45:26.026]  I feel like I look better.
[00:45:26.086 --> 00:45:26.726]  I feel better.
[00:45:26.786 --> 00:45:27.826]  I feel sexier.
[00:45:27.846 --> 00:45:28.607]  I love it.
[00:45:28.827 --> 00:45:31.748]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:45:31.808 --> 00:45:34.549]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.

[00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:36.850]  Consult your physician.
[00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:39.191]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:40.292]  This is life changing.
[00:45:40.856 --> 00:45:44.359]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:45:44.519 --> 00:45:48.482]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:45:48.803 --> 00:45:50.264]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:45:50.584 --> 00:45:58.171]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:45:58.431 --> 00:45:59.292]  But for how long?
[00:45:59.572 --> 00:46:01.573]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:46:01.794 --> 00:46:05.837]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:46:06.217 --> 00:46:07.398]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:09.040]  Just won't quit.
[00:46:10.339 --> 00:46:17.382]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:46:17.482 --> 00:46:19.643]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:46:19.823 --> 00:46:24.926]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:46:25.126 --> 00:46:30.048]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:46:30.288 --> 00:46:33.331]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:46:33.591 --> 00:46:37.455]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:41.919]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:52.029]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:54.752]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:46:54.892 --> 00:46:55.553]  Coast to coast.
[00:46:55.593 --> 00:46:56.534]  Direct from Austin.
[00:46:56.634 --> 00:46:59.036]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:22.643 --> 00:47:24.125]  We are on the march.
[00:47:24.745 --> 00:47:26.988]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:47:27.609 --> 00:47:32.214]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:32.294 --> 00:47:42.325]  I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime.
[00:47:55.427 --> 00:47:55.867]  That's right.
[00:47:55.907 --> 00:48:00.431]  We don't have much time here on this earth, so we need to spend it wisely.
[00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:03.894]  We need to look at ourselves in the mirror and man up.
[00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:07.056]  And when there are problems out there, we need to confront them.
[00:48:08.557 --> 00:48:11.139]  That's how you gotta live your life.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.422]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:14.482 --> 00:48:15.543]  I'm your host, Rob Doo.
[00:48:16.223 --> 00:48:21.327]  Riding with you, I guess for the next hour and ten minutes, is gonna be Paul Joseph Watson as well, riding shotgun.
[00:48:21.848 --> 00:48:23.589]  We're gonna take your calls coming up
[00:48:24.685 --> 00:48:28.869]  At the end of this segment, we're going to start taking your calls.
[00:48:28.889 --> 00:48:30.030]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:30.330]  877-789-2539.
[00:48:30.871 --> 00:48:34.234]  You can call us in with your questions.
[00:48:35.155 --> 00:48:37.737]  On Ebola, we're going to start talking about ISIS here in a second.
[00:48:38.878 --> 00:48:41.101]  Even a little NFL on NFL Worship Day.
[00:48:41.621 --> 00:48:45.122]  We're going to talk a little bit about the NFL's FBI contingent.
[00:48:45.142 --> 00:48:47.963]  They have a whole department dedicated to covering up scandals.
[00:48:48.443 --> 00:48:53.184]  Does it surprise you that these people also work with the federal government to get you on Obamacare and take away your guns?
[00:48:53.745 --> 00:48:54.545]  Doesn't surprise me.
[00:48:57.926 --> 00:48:59.506]  We might even get into some chemtrail news.
[00:49:00.506 --> 00:49:05.188]  There was an interesting article that came out in CBS, it was on Drudge Report, about
[00:49:06.198 --> 00:49:11.041]  A mysterious streak of light in the Bay Area that morning, people were talking about it.
[00:49:11.162 --> 00:49:13.723]  And it reminded me of an article we posted on Friday.
[00:49:14.784 --> 00:49:18.627]  And we'll get to that all coming up in the next hour.
[00:49:20.388 --> 00:49:23.330]  Paul, we've got some interesting stuff going on with ISIS.
[00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:30.795]  A few days ago, the entire ISIS opposition was blown up in an explosion.
[00:49:30.936 --> 00:49:31.716]  How convenient.
[00:49:33.758 --> 00:49:35.158]  They were all sent to Mustafar.
[00:49:36.249 --> 00:49:40.413]  And, uh, Anakin Skywalker came in with a lightsaber and just started slicing and dicing.
[00:49:40.773 --> 00:49:42.234]  And then I guess blew up the station.
[00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:44.536]  I mean, at least that's how it happened in Star Wars Episode 3.
[00:49:44.596 --> 00:49:46.478]  Uh, what do you make of that?
[00:49:46.958 --> 00:49:49.720]  The entire leadership is just decimated with a bomb.
[00:49:50.761 --> 00:49:57.627]  We got the footage running right now if you're watching on Prison Planet TV of, uh, Anakin about to take care of the guys who were supposed to be on his side.
[00:49:58.808 --> 00:49:59.088]  Yeah.
[00:49:59.108 --> 00:50:01.150]  There he is taking care of them.
[00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:02.551]  Paul, what do you make of all this?
[00:50:05.552 --> 00:50:07.013]  That was a really bizarre story.
[00:50:07.053 --> 00:50:10.656]  I know these rebel groups like to blow each other up on a regular basis now.
[00:50:10.676 --> 00:50:16.221]  There's a lot of infighting, but it was quite bizarre that this mystery explosion just wiped out all of them.
[00:50:17.102 --> 00:50:25.909]  There's also a really interesting article on ISIS called Passed to War Then and Now Haunt Obama, which is a New York Times article at the top of Drudge at the moment.
[00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:32.075]  And there are several interesting quotes, including about these beheading videos, which we can move on to a little bit later.
[00:50:32.115 --> 00:50:44.668]  But in terms of ISIS and the strike on Syria, which we saw introduced last week in Obama's speech, or earlier this week, it's now come to light that before he gave that speech on Wednesday night, Obama met
[00:50:45.268 --> 00:50:48.969]  With basically the CFR and the big new Brzezinski.
[00:50:48.989 --> 00:50:57.450]  Now remember, Hillary Clinton admitted that the CFR was located just down the street from the State Department because it gives the State Department its orders.
[00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:59.071]  It runs US foreign policy.
[00:50:59.111 --> 00:51:11.413]  So hours before Obama gave this big speech on ISIS and how he's planning to conduct airstrikes in Syria, which of course he failed to do last year, he's meeting with the CFR and he's also meeting with
[00:51:12.333 --> 00:51:19.859]  Groups of columnists and magazine writers for a, quote, discussion hours before he gives this major speech.
[00:51:19.899 --> 00:51:25.023]  He's meeting with all these editorial writers, media heads from the New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:51:25.883 --> 00:51:29.146]  And it's obviously to massage the message on ISIS.
[00:51:29.206 --> 00:51:33.850]  We saw this with Bush numerous times before he gave major foreign policy speeches.
[00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:38.033]  He would meet with the New York Times and the Washington Post hours beforehand.
[00:51:38.573 --> 00:51:48.038]  To basically instruct them on how to craft the narrative, craft what he's trying to push, the propaganda he's trying to manifest and project onto the American people.
[00:51:48.458 --> 00:51:49.678]  And that's state media!
[00:51:49.938 --> 00:52:00.163]  I mean, it's a glaring example of how they basically get their marching orders to create the narrative that the White House wants, and then they put it out immediately after Obama's speech.
[00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:02.504]  And Paul, we did not get invited to this press conference.
[00:52:04.229 --> 00:52:08.451]  That's how I can tell you it's state-run media because not all the media were asked to come to this.
[00:52:08.551 --> 00:52:09.572]  I can tell you that right now.
[00:52:10.112 --> 00:52:16.195]  InfoWars was not asked to come and sit and take notes and be given fact sheets of the talking points.
[00:52:16.755 --> 00:52:18.476]  I'm going to go back to something.
[00:52:19.076 --> 00:52:23.739]  Right before September 11th, remember they killed the commander of the Northern Alliance with a bomb?
[00:52:23.759 --> 00:52:29.162]  They had some guys that were going to come interview him and they killed him right before 9-11 happened and all this invasion.
[00:52:29.182 --> 00:52:33.564]  So maybe this is a precursor to another invasion of Syria.
[00:52:35.043 --> 00:52:36.384]  Maybe that's what this means.
[00:52:36.404 --> 00:52:41.751]  They go in and kill these supposed opposition leaders to bring in a whole new crop of people that we don't know anything about.
[00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:47.317]  I don't know much about these Syrian opposition guys anyway, but now we have a whole new crop of people we know nothing about.
[00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:49.440]  Who could be involved in that?
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.082]  And who could pull something off like that?
[00:52:51.122 --> 00:52:52.103]  What kind of an operation?
[00:52:52.203 --> 00:52:52.724]  Makes you wonder.
[00:52:53.936 --> 00:53:00.162]  Well, I mean, they're arming the Syrian opposition who are openly defecting and giving weapons to ISIS.
[00:53:00.242 --> 00:53:02.645]  I mean, I documented that last week in an article.
[00:53:02.705 --> 00:53:16.839]  So, the announcement for Obama to send all this aid and weapons to these Syrian rebels is basically fighting ISIS by arming ISIS because now, as I documented in that article, they're defecting to ISIS, giving them weapons.
[00:53:16.899 --> 00:53:17.180]  In fact,
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:23.246]  Beheaded journalist Stephen Sokloff was sold to ISIS by the so-called moderate rebels.
[00:53:23.626 --> 00:53:33.937]  So now we're backing the allies of ISIS as the US's allies in the region, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Jordan, funded, bankrolled, trained ISIS militants in the first place.
[00:53:34.417 --> 00:53:36.239]  But going back to this New York Times article,
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:44.825]  A quote, Obama contemplated the possibility that Mr. Assad might order his forces to fire at American planes entering Syrian airspace.
[00:53:45.145 --> 00:53:59.134]  If he dared to do that, you know, if he dared to defend his own country, quote, Mr. Obama said he would order American forces to wipe out Syria's air defense system, which he noted would be easier than striking ISIS because its locations are better known.
[00:53:59.654 --> 00:54:03.498]  He went on to say that such an action by Mr Assad would lead to his overthrow.
[00:54:03.919 --> 00:54:16.753]  So Obama is now saying in private, and this has been leaked since, that if Syria dares to defend its own sovereign airspace against American bombardment under the justification of targeting ISIS,
[00:54:17.293 --> 00:54:21.076]  That basically Obama will launch a full-scale war on Syria.
[00:54:21.476 --> 00:54:38.388]  So it reminds us of the plot back during, just before the Iraq invasion, where they planned to fly a U-2 spy plane over Iraq, painted in UN colours, and try to provoke Saddam Hussein into ordering it being shot down, to create the pretext for a justified attack.
[00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:41.731]  So now we're seeing exactly the same script being repeated in Syria.
[00:54:42.031 --> 00:54:46.512]  Yeah, I think Dick Cheney came up with that plan, with the U2 spy plane.
[00:54:46.572 --> 00:54:48.313]  I mean, these people will not stop.
[00:54:48.373 --> 00:54:53.474]  They have to have their clone droid armies fighting against each other, and we have to pay for it.
[00:54:54.074 --> 00:54:56.995]  And this is just, it's the same story over and over again.
[00:54:57.275 --> 00:54:58.915]  Ten years later, we're still at the same spot.
[00:54:58.935 --> 00:55:09.518]  We're about to go to war with an enemy that we cannot beat, that has no base of operations, that can strike us at any time, and there might even be reports of these guys coming over the border.
[00:55:09.678 --> 00:55:10.258]  We don't know.
[00:55:11.636 --> 00:55:14.178]  We just don't know what is going to happen.
[00:55:14.799 --> 00:55:15.880]  And they've got it.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.421]  They're arming these guys.
[00:55:17.541 --> 00:55:18.982]  They've got it so well orchestrated.
[00:55:20.143 --> 00:55:29.892]  And now we have senators like Patrick Leahy coming out and saying, if we go against NSA, if we curb the NSA, it could help ISIS.
[00:55:30.152 --> 00:55:30.872]  That's from the Hill.
[00:55:32.077 --> 00:55:32.657]  I genuinely believe
[00:55:58.485 --> 00:55:59.006]  I agree with that.
[00:56:13.724 --> 00:56:18.187]  You know, I tried ten years ago to stop this from happening, and I was shouted down.
[00:56:18.807 --> 00:56:22.550]  But what we can do is to make sure that it doesn't get worse.
[00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:28.994]  And I'm afraid, within our own states, we're going to have to be very, very vigilant indeed.
[00:56:29.454 --> 00:56:36.698]  And that probably means, and I'm sad to say this, but it probably means giving up some of the liberties that previously we've enjoyed.
[00:56:37.159 --> 00:56:38.920]  Well, my previous comment to you, Neil, was
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:51.584]  That I thought we would have to surrender some of the previous liberties and freedoms that we enjoyed in order to deal with something that is a crisis that does actually... And let's be serious.
[00:56:52.444 --> 00:56:55.525]  This faces the very existence of our civilization.
[00:56:55.725 --> 00:56:58.506]  You know, there are people out there... No, sorry.
[00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:01.927]  There are people within here that want to destroy us.
[00:57:02.897 --> 00:57:07.241]  And their main means of communication is social media.
[00:57:07.441 --> 00:57:22.434]  And I'm afraid that the state and the services and the authorities that are paid and empowered to protect us are going to have to have more powers to deal with these people and they will do it via social media.
[00:57:22.514 --> 00:57:25.177]  And I hate to say this because it seems to me that
[00:57:25.857 --> 00:57:39.644]  You know, if I ring you on a Sunday night to talk about the football game, or whatever it may be, or we email each other to talk about mutual friends, I would rather live in a world where that was free and private than where we had our liberty.
[00:57:40.445 --> 00:57:47.909]  But I'm afraid that we're now in territory that is so, so serious.
[00:57:48.209 --> 00:57:53.812]  And I say this not willing for this to happen, but let's just remember
[00:57:54.454 --> 00:57:57.833]  But ISIS have said they will launch terrorist attacks.
[00:58:01.169 --> 00:58:11.371]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:58:11.731 --> 00:58:17.772]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:58:18.192 --> 00:58:20.412]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:58:20.512 --> 00:58:23.573]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:58:23.613 --> 00:58:30.474]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:34.491]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:58:34.652 --> 00:58:38.613]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:58:38.933 --> 00:58:40.394]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:58:40.714 --> 00:58:45.736]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:58:46.036 --> 00:58:48.297]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:58:48.577 --> 00:58:49.418]  But for how long?
[00:58:49.718 --> 00:58:51.719]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:58:51.919 --> 00:58:55.981]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:58:56.361 --> 00:58:59.162]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:59:00.786 --> 00:59:10.310]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:20.195]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:59:20.375 --> 00:59:23.296]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:59:23.496 --> 00:59:24.117]  I think so.
[00:59:38.613 --> 00:59:38.993]  We're good.
[01:00:01.997 --> 01:00:03.178]  Coast to Coast.
[01:00:03.538 --> 01:00:04.899]  Direct from Austin.
[01:00:05.599 --> 01:00:09.681]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:12.723 --> 01:00:18.746]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.328]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:29.248 --> 01:00:33.649]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:00:33.669 --> 01:00:34.069]  877-789-2539.
[01:00:34.269 --> 01:00:42.111]  We've got some callers lining up now wanting to talk about Ebola and the military response.
[01:00:42.131 --> 01:00:43.251]  That was one thing we didn't cover.
[01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:45.031]  The DOD is going to be tasked.
[01:00:45.091 --> 01:00:46.892]  They're making that their number one priority.
[01:00:46.932 --> 01:00:49.452]  I've got Paul Joseph Watson with me riding shotgun.
[01:00:50.372 --> 01:00:51.793]  I'm actually looking for that article right now.
[01:00:51.813 --> 01:00:54.233]  It was a Fox News article that we had.
[01:00:54.853 --> 01:00:56.274]  And we're going to finish up on ISIS.
[01:00:56.414 --> 01:00:56.674]  We got
[01:00:57.774 --> 01:01:01.077]  Five-minute segment here, and then we're gonna come back from this break.
[01:01:01.117 --> 01:01:01.657]  I promise.
[01:01:01.677 --> 01:01:04.099]  We're gonna go right to Bowser in Missouri.
[01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:08.823]  We got Jim and Callie, Roy in Montana, Jim in Tennessee, and Rashid in Philadelphia.
[01:01:08.843 --> 01:01:12.145]  You guys are all very concerned about Ebola, and that's good.
[01:01:12.225 --> 01:01:15.448]  This is something we should be concerned about, especially now that we're importing it into our country.
[01:01:15.728 --> 01:01:20.111]  The State Department's getting over 160,000 hazmat uniforms.
[01:01:20.472 --> 01:01:22.433]  That's the State Department, not even the CDC.
[01:01:22.854 --> 01:01:24.235]  I mean, what does this all mean?
[01:01:24.255 --> 01:01:24.815]  This is crazy.
[01:01:26.613 --> 01:01:27.854]  Paul, let's get back to ISIS.
[01:01:28.455 --> 01:01:29.956]  Let's finish up on this.
[01:01:30.957 --> 01:01:31.737]  We've got senators.
[01:01:31.777 --> 01:01:38.763]  We just finished up with that clip from Nigel Farage talking about how he's channeling bizarro Ben Franklin.
[01:01:38.803 --> 01:01:40.825]  We have to give up our liberties for security.
[01:01:40.885 --> 01:01:42.626]  We have to give up our liberties for security.
[01:01:42.826 --> 01:01:44.328]  I mean, and this is coming from everywhere.
[01:01:44.408 --> 01:01:47.911]  Even the Huffington Post is saying we've got to raise taxes and bring back the draft to fight ISIS?
[01:01:48.111 --> 01:01:49.132]  I mean, this is a group we funded.
[01:01:49.152 --> 01:01:50.773]  Why don't we just cut their funding?
[01:01:52.421 --> 01:02:06.371]  Well, the potency of this propaganda is seemingly so intense that it's fooled people on both the left and right that you would normally assume would be guarded against this kind of militaristic, bellicose, you know, talking point.
[01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:08.633]  Because, I mean, you know, with Farage...
[01:02:09.878 --> 01:02:15.342]  The NSA bulk collection of data from telephone calls did not foil a single terrorist plot.
[01:02:15.382 --> 01:02:16.542]  I mean, that's documented.
[01:02:16.562 --> 01:02:25.288]  There's a Washington blog article about that which goes through the justifications and then the debunking that it never stopped a single terrorist plot.
[01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:27.170]  So it's a false paradigm in the first place.
[01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:41.473]  I think Farage, Farage's logic is absent the fact that many of the terror plots in the United States and indeed in Britain where most of the radical Islamic preachers are actually, you know, MI5 informants if you actually dig into it.
[01:02:42.073 --> 01:02:47.054]  Same in the United States with the FBI being behind most domestic terror plots.
[01:02:47.094 --> 01:02:53.196]  They create the Patsies, they provide them with the fake explosives in the first place, they radicalize all the members of the terrorist cells.
[01:02:53.956 --> 01:02:57.438]  You know, his argument is absent that foundational logic.
[01:02:57.558 --> 01:02:59.939]  They find people of dubious mental clarity.
[01:03:00.019 --> 01:03:02.340]  I mean, most of these guys have very low IQs.
[01:03:03.741 --> 01:03:08.644]  There was one case, it was a group of guys in a house in, I think it was Ohio, and they were going to blow up a bridge.
[01:03:09.364 --> 01:03:16.589]  And the landlord was the guy who was the informant, and he was getting these guys riled up every day, and then like, hey, I got the bomb, I got the bomb, let's go do it.
[01:03:16.869 --> 01:03:19.691]  I mean, it's total, it's insanity what the FBI does now.
[01:03:20.051 --> 01:03:21.672]  And this is just to keep their budgets going.
[01:03:22.012 --> 01:03:23.954]  This is just to keep the war on terror going.
[01:03:23.994 --> 01:03:26.736]  It's like why they ship drugs into this country.
[01:03:26.776 --> 01:03:30.138]  To keep the war on drugs going, we gotta ship in the drugs and feed them to people.
[01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:32.063]  It's insane.
[01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:41.651]  I mean, even the New York Times, there was quite a famous article a couple of years ago where it was something like, FBI plots created by the, terror plots created by the FBI.
[01:03:41.671 --> 01:03:53.742]  And basically every single major domestic terror plot has been a result of the FBI radicalizing these mentally disturbed patsies, providing them with the fake explosives, generating, contriving the plot themselves.
[01:03:54.142 --> 01:03:59.424]  And I think Farage is playing off this idea that Cameron and Obama have been, quote, weak on ISIS.
[01:03:59.484 --> 01:04:02.486]  But again, it's absent the knowledge that the U.S.
[01:04:02.586 --> 01:04:06.067]  trained many ISIS militants in Jordan in 2012.
[01:04:06.107 --> 01:04:08.548]  Of course, many Syrian rebels backed by the U.K.
[01:04:08.568 --> 01:04:09.028]  and the U.S.
[01:04:09.068 --> 01:04:11.990]  defected to ISIS, became part of the radicalized group.
[01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:14.631]  So as UKIP becomes more
[01:04:15.191 --> 01:04:21.715]  Closer to the mainstream as they try to accrue more power, they're taking on more establishment talking points, which is concerning.
[01:04:21.756 --> 01:04:44.771]  I mean, I voted for them in the recent European elections because they offered a genuine alternative, but any so-called self-proclaimed libertarian that says we need to give up our freedom for security needs to take a serious look in the mirror because we're told that the terrorists hate us for our freedom, yet we're going to willingly give it up in the name of fighting terrorism, which in the main is created by our own government.
[01:04:45.171 --> 01:04:48.114]  That's the great paradox that we live in now.
[01:04:48.954 --> 01:04:50.676]  Because of the terrorists that we arm.
[01:04:50.696 --> 01:04:52.797]  And that we give training to.
[01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:54.098]  And missiles.
[01:04:54.919 --> 01:04:55.640]  And Benghazi.
[01:04:56.621 --> 01:04:57.822]  And now we give them airliners.
[01:04:58.982 --> 01:04:59.543]  Strap yourselves in.
[01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:00.584]  We're going to be going to calls.
[01:05:01.184 --> 01:05:04.087]  This next break coming up in one minute.
[01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:05.668]  Bowser, you're up.
[01:05:06.248 --> 01:05:06.669]  Get ready.
[01:05:06.689 --> 01:05:07.990]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.730]  I'm your host, Rob Doo.
[01:05:10.029 --> 01:05:18.495]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:05:18.695 --> 01:05:24.900]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.623]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here, Survival Shield X2.
[01:05:30.863 --> 01:05:43.309]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:05:43.689 --> 01:05:50.452]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients.
[01:05:50.592 --> 01:05:51.573]  What did you grab there?
[01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:18.625]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:06:19.706 --> 01:06:22.846]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:06:22.906 --> 01:06:24.767]  Mao took the guns.
[01:06:24.867 --> 01:06:27.647]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:27.687 --> 01:06:28.868]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:50.383]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:06:52.488 --> 01:06:55.495]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:07:09.884 --> 01:07:10.265]  We're good to go.
[01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.968]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:24.988 --> 01:07:28.352]  We've got one more hour here live, September 14, 2014.
[01:07:29.153 --> 01:07:30.094]  I'm your host Rob Due.
[01:07:30.554 --> 01:07:35.560]  You can find out more information on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:36.461 --> 01:07:41.887]  And if you want to watch the show free for live on internet TV, you can go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:07:42.848 --> 01:07:46.630]  And you can watch all the stuff we're doing here, showing you the articles, showing you video clips.
[01:07:47.671 --> 01:07:51.513]  I've got riding shotgun with me, Paul Watson, over in England.
[01:07:51.813 --> 01:07:56.235]  We're talking about ISIS right now, but first, before we go any further, we're going to go to your calls.
[01:07:56.876 --> 01:07:58.897]  We got Bowser in Missouri.
[01:07:59.357 --> 01:08:00.078]  Thanks for waiting.
[01:08:00.578 --> 01:08:01.398]  What's your question, Bowser?
[01:08:02.359 --> 01:08:02.959]  Yes.
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:05.841]  Good talk to you, InfoWarriors.
[01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:08.262]  Really enjoy Paul Watson's reports.
[01:08:08.322 --> 01:08:08.802]  He's great.
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:12.080]  I called today.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.321]  I'm an old guy, 61.
[01:08:14.381 --> 01:08:16.001]  I was a medic in the paratroops.
[01:08:16.041 --> 01:08:18.001]  However, my dad was a colonel.
[01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:22.002]  He was an NBC warfare expert, a general staff officer.
[01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:28.523]  I've been worried about biological breakouts since I was about 10 years old.
[01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:37.405]  I just wanted to bring attention to your listeners, a great book that truly brings home the horrors
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:44.505]  of the biowarfare scenario, and that is a book called The Demon in the Freezer.
[01:08:45.306 --> 01:08:46.847]  You can find it on Amazon.
[01:08:47.507 --> 01:08:56.575]  And it covers the Marburg virus, which is essentially the same thing as Ebola, and smallpox, etc.
[01:08:57.315 --> 01:09:04.221]  And it closes out the book with the last couple chapters on the monkey house in Reston, Virginia.
[01:09:05.122 --> 01:09:06.723]  And I guarantee you, you'll have
[01:09:07.504 --> 01:09:10.399]  A week's worth of sleepless nights after you read that book.
[01:09:11.303 --> 01:09:12.004]  That's all, guys.
[01:09:12.184 --> 01:09:20.529]  Well, let me tell you, I couldn't sleep after watching that NOVA clip, just how they knew back in 1989 that this disease could go airborne back then.
[01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:26.714]  They had traced it going through the ventilation shaft, getting different areas of monkeys were getting infected.
[01:09:26.754 --> 01:09:28.595]  They had to eradicate 400 monkeys.
[01:09:28.635 --> 01:09:32.257]  And it was the US military going in there in secret doing this.
[01:09:32.277 --> 01:09:33.238]  This never made the news.
[01:09:33.258 --> 01:09:40.083]  And it becomes a footnote in a NOVA presentation with a nice narrator talking it over like it's no big deal.
[01:09:40.883 --> 01:09:41.263]  Right.
[01:09:41.363 --> 01:09:42.684]  They eradicated the problem.
[01:09:43.084 --> 01:09:43.865]  Yes, uh-huh.
[01:09:44.525 --> 01:09:51.869]  Well, we're, I mean, this is so frightening to me, the fact that they're telling us that 20,000 people are infected.
[01:09:51.889 --> 01:09:55.951]  My guess, it's probably closer to a quarter million by now.
[01:09:56.311 --> 01:09:57.112]  And I mean that.
[01:09:57.672 --> 01:10:00.073]  Oh no, no, they say this thing's gonna double every two weeks.
[01:10:00.854 --> 01:10:01.654]  So if you have 20,000 a few days ago,
[01:10:04.779 --> 01:10:06.040]  You know, in a few days it's going to be 40.
[01:10:06.741 --> 01:10:07.341]  And then it's going to be 80.
[01:10:08.262 --> 01:10:09.162]  And then it's 160.
[01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:10.944]  And that's just the ones they know about.
[01:10:11.264 --> 01:10:12.505]  What about the ones they don't know about?
[01:10:12.585 --> 01:10:13.866]  What about the ones in the outlying areas?
[01:10:13.886 --> 01:10:15.367]  The people who are getting turned away.
[01:10:15.387 --> 01:10:16.848]  Because people are getting turned away from clinics.
[01:10:16.868 --> 01:10:23.433]  And they say, every time one's getting turned away, that's another one and a half cases that we know of that could just be infected.
[01:10:23.473 --> 01:10:24.594]  So, I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:10:24.634 --> 01:10:25.955]  There is no response to this.
[01:10:26.095 --> 01:10:28.557]  And they just don't want to admit that it's gone airborne.
[01:10:29.298 --> 01:10:30.559]  So, do you have anything else to add, Bowser?
[01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:38.286]  Yes, it's also insane and unconscionable that they're actually flying these victims all over the world.
[01:10:38.866 --> 01:10:40.507]  I mean, that's not what you do.
[01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:42.468]  You pin them up.
[01:10:42.548 --> 01:10:45.470]  You know, it sounds cruel, but you pin them up and you let them die there.
[01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:46.231]  That's what you do.
[01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:49.433]  Or at least take a ship.
[01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:52.451]  Out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and fly everybody there.
[01:10:52.531 --> 01:10:53.572]  Put it in the Mediterranean.
[01:10:53.932 --> 01:10:56.034]  Put it where nobody else is going to get infected.
[01:10:56.374 --> 01:10:57.475]  And don't let anybody off the ship.
[01:10:57.535 --> 01:11:02.198]  If you go on this ship, you sign an agreement saying you're not going to leave for at least six months.
[01:11:02.418 --> 01:11:07.281]  So we know, bonafide, that you're not infected and you're not going to infect anybody else.
[01:11:08.582 --> 01:11:13.745]  Yeah, it's just unconscionable the way they're handling this and they're doing it, I think, on purpose.
[01:11:13.865 --> 01:11:16.267]  I think it's all part of the global
[01:11:17.313 --> 01:11:18.513]  Depopulation plan.
[01:11:18.593 --> 01:11:19.614]  I really do, fellas.
[01:11:19.814 --> 01:11:25.715]  Well, you know, Bill Gates is getting involved now and, you know, now GlaxoSmithKline wants to make a vaccine.
[01:11:26.195 --> 01:11:28.316]  Well, if they make a vaccine, it ends up in the United States.
[01:11:28.356 --> 01:11:36.378]  You've suddenly got 300 million people who want to buy this thing right off the bat and who actually have the money to buy it, unlike most of these African countries where it has to be aided in.
[01:11:36.718 --> 01:11:37.698]  Thanks for your call, Bowser.
[01:11:37.718 --> 01:11:39.398]  We're going to go now to Jim in Cali.
[01:11:39.418 --> 01:11:42.439]  He wants to talk about Ebola and the military response.
[01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:47.801]  I agree Jim, it doesn't make sense that the DOD is being enlisted to help eradicate Ebola.
[01:11:49.241 --> 01:11:51.001]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[01:11:51.262 --> 01:12:09.107]  On that subject, if you recall a couple years ago there was a drill, a public drill between the US military and the CDC in which they went out and had people dressed up as zombies and they would shoot them in this staged
[01:12:10.271 --> 01:12:10.872]  We're good to go.
[01:12:27.666 --> 01:12:41.716]  They needed some sort of fantastical cover for what could be a real scenario where you have scores of infected people that they need to quarantine and at the end of the day they'll do to us like they did to those monkeys in Reston and just shoot us all down.
[01:12:42.648 --> 01:12:50.991]  It'll be a secret military mission where they close off a city and come in and firebomb the place and then those who get out will be shot with guns.
[01:12:51.191 --> 01:12:52.392]  I mean, you could see that in the movies.
[01:12:52.512 --> 01:12:55.153]  And Ebola is a zombie-like virus.
[01:12:55.193 --> 01:12:58.474]  I mean, it transmitted through blood, through biting.
[01:13:00.475 --> 01:13:06.337]  It makes sense that they would be training to eradicate zombies because that's what they think is coming down the pipe.
[01:13:07.037 --> 01:13:15.981]  And that, of course, the CDC is involved in it, but they'll have their experimental vaccine that's probably clean, not filled with mercury, to help themselves out.
[01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:18.282]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:13:19.222 --> 01:13:20.263]  People gotta look into this stuff.
[01:13:20.303 --> 01:13:23.584]  It's always stuff that happens two or three years ago that's now coming back into the news.
[01:13:24.524 --> 01:13:25.465]  You got anything else to add, Jim?
[01:13:26.894 --> 01:13:43.783]  Yeah, speaking of the vaccines, I just got a chance to watch World War Z, and one thing that caught my attention is that their solution for the zombie virus was to inject everybody with another deadly virus.
[01:13:44.363 --> 01:13:46.444]  Yeah, and they don't talk about what happens after that.
[01:13:48.129 --> 01:13:49.010]  Yes, exactly.
[01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:53.092]  But yeah, that was the hope of mankind was to basically inject yourself with another deadly virus.
[01:13:53.132 --> 01:13:57.054]  So hopefully that's not predicted programming, but you know how Hollywood is these days.
[01:13:57.694 --> 01:14:02.977]  Well, in book two, apparently, or I think in the next movie, if they do make it, apparently they come after gun owners next.
[01:14:03.017 --> 01:14:05.319]  That's the big fight is in the U.S.
[01:14:05.359 --> 01:14:08.741]  with the patriots who have their guns still and don't want to give them up.
[01:14:09.421 --> 01:14:11.682]  So that's where that is going.
[01:14:11.702 --> 01:14:12.823]  Thanks for the call, Jim.
[01:14:13.283 --> 01:14:15.124]  We go now to Roy in Montana.
[01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:16.045]  Roy, how's it going?
[01:14:17.108 --> 01:14:17.388]  Good.
[01:14:17.448 --> 01:14:18.508]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:14:18.608 --> 01:14:20.649]  I really appreciate getting to talk to you.
[01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:22.350]  And Paul, I really respect you guys.
[01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:23.910]  Yeah.
[01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:24.530]  What's your question?
[01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.850]  Go ahead.
[01:14:25.431 --> 01:14:26.931]  Well, I don't actually have a question.
[01:14:26.971 --> 01:14:28.952]  My son was in the Army.
[01:14:29.592 --> 01:14:38.354]  He was in a sniper recon platoon over in Afghanistan, came back and then he has to do a stint in the National Guard for a year and a half or two years.
[01:14:38.955 --> 01:14:41.876]  And they just got done with their big training down in Idaho.
[01:14:41.956 --> 01:14:43.236]  And there was a two-star general.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:45.281]  And two guys there from the Pentagon.
[01:14:45.542 --> 01:14:47.503]  And each of them was given a survey.
[01:14:48.204 --> 01:14:52.407]  And the survey said, are you willing to confiscate weapons from civilians?
[01:14:53.068 --> 01:14:57.031]  And if ordered to, will you fire on American citizens?
[01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:01.035]  And, you know, he said they were outraged.
[01:15:01.535 --> 01:15:05.619]  And the general told him that the Pentagon guys said they were gearing up for something and
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:13.943]  2016, but they wouldn't tell him what and told him a couple of other things on the side and So I thought you guys would be interested in that.
[01:15:14.283 --> 01:15:18.545]  That's very interesting Is that online anywhere or is that just this is just a story from your son?
[01:15:19.565 --> 01:15:30.009]  Well, that's just the story from my son and the guys that you know, they had to go over there So the guys from his platoon that came back with him and they were outraged.
[01:15:30.029 --> 01:15:34.231]  She's trying to get a copy from Somebody you know so we can send it to you guys.
[01:15:34.251 --> 01:15:34.331]  Yeah
[01:15:34.591 --> 01:15:37.392]  Yeah, a copy or even a shot on a cell phone, anything like that.
[01:15:37.472 --> 01:15:50.715]  Anytime something like that pops up, you need to immediately shoot that on your smartphone and send it to tips at InfoWars.com or whistleblower at InfoWars.com and I comb through those regularly and I love to receive the tips.
[01:15:50.775 --> 01:15:52.175]  I mean, I've received some outrageous stuff.
[01:15:52.195 --> 01:15:57.017]  Some stuff that we haven't even gone public with yet because we have to vet it first because it's so outrageous.
[01:15:58.197 --> 01:15:59.260]  Roy, thanks for the call.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.827]  We're going to be back right after this with more of your questions.
[01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:05.296]  It's the Alex Jones Show and I'm your host Rob Due, Infowars.com.
[01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:20.786]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:16:20.926 --> 01:16:30.691]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:16:30.851 --> 01:16:33.773]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:16:33.993 --> 01:16:34.594]  I think so.
[01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:49.465]  We're good.
[01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:13.388]  In the near future.
[01:17:13.668 --> 01:17:17.810]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:19.171]  Security alert.
[01:17:19.391 --> 01:17:21.112]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:17:21.392 --> 01:17:22.013]  Analysis.

[01:17:25.095 --> 01:17:29.937]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:17:29.977 --> 01:17:30.918]  Crime Directive.
[01:17:31.018 --> 01:17:32.459]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:17:32.559 --> 01:17:35.321]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:17:35.341 --> 01:17:38.482]  It's a popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:17:38.643 --> 01:17:40.824]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:42.424]  People are assaulting us.
[01:17:42.464 --> 01:17:44.785]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:17:45.285 --> 01:17:46.945]  They are never going to stop.
[01:17:47.245 --> 01:17:51.146]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:18:01.248 --> 01:18:05.668]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:18:05.949 --> 01:18:07.289]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:18:07.329 --> 01:18:08.049]  You can feel it.
[01:18:11.044 --> 01:18:12.265]  Another major health threat.
[01:18:12.305 --> 01:18:17.207]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:18:17.287 --> 01:18:19.908]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:18:19.948 --> 01:18:26.730]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:18:26.991 --> 01:18:29.852]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:18:29.972 --> 01:18:32.913]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:18:32.933 --> 01:18:34.934]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:18:34.954 --> 01:18:37.795]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:43.398]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:18:43.598 --> 01:18:47.081]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[01:19:23.127 --> 01:19:29.673]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:33.997]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:20:23.725 --> 01:20:31.432]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:36.136 --> 01:20:38.297]  All right, we're gonna go right back to your calls.
[01:20:38.337 --> 01:20:42.499]  We got Rashid, O'Brien, Paul, Peter, Habu, Mark, Jim.
[01:20:43.139 --> 01:20:46.881]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:20:46.901 --> 01:20:47.201]  877-789-2539.
[01:20:48.622 --> 01:20:52.243]  I promise I will let Paul answer some of these questions.
[01:20:52.283 --> 01:20:55.064]  I've been hogging the callers, and I apologize for that.
[01:20:55.124 --> 01:20:58.546]  But we're gonna keep going here, and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:58.626 --> 01:20:59.466]  I'm your host, Rob Due.
[01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:02.848]  Rashid, Philadelphia, what is your question, sir?
[01:21:04.594 --> 01:21:06.316]  Um, I don't really have a question.
[01:21:06.396 --> 01:21:17.665]  I just wanted to mention something that I, I don't know, seemed interesting last month.
[01:21:19.546 --> 01:21:27.092]  The first week of August, I watched, uh, 12 Monkeys for the first time.
[01:21:28.433 --> 01:21:34.198]  And that seemed kind of interesting that the whole Ebola thing was being hyped at that
[01:21:38.124 --> 01:21:42.806]  You don't think it was your watching of 12 Monkeys that caused it, do you?
[01:21:42.846 --> 01:21:43.526]  I don't know.
[01:21:43.907 --> 01:21:44.567]  No, I doubt it.
[01:21:44.587 --> 01:21:46.888]  That was a weird coincidence.
[01:21:48.288 --> 01:22:03.855]  Well, you know, 12 Monkeys does have a lot of interesting stuff and what's interesting as well is I watched that movie just recently this year and we started making a promo on it and we kind of got put on the back burner and I'm going to pull it back out this week and finish it up because yeah, there was a disease out there and people thought it was
[01:22:04.395 --> 01:22:13.922]  Having to do with the army of the 12 monkeys and it ended up just being a crazy person who actually worked in a lab, a bio lab, went around infecting the world.
[01:22:14.342 --> 01:22:20.987]  And so they had to send a guy, Bruce Willis, back in the past to help find out how it spread.
[01:22:21.027 --> 01:22:21.908]  That was their big thing.
[01:22:22.548 --> 01:22:25.951]  Paul, do you have any comment on the movie 12 Monkeys and how it relates to Ebola?
[01:22:27.170 --> 01:22:29.111]  That's one that I've never seen, actually, Rob.
[01:22:29.131 --> 01:22:31.192]  I always intended to see that one but never got around to it.
[01:22:31.492 --> 01:22:40.536]  On the previous call, this army drill with the CDC targeting, quote, zombies, that was based around an epidemic.
[01:22:40.796 --> 01:22:47.279]  I mean, the quote from the article was, trainees will have to respond to medical emergencies while being harassed by zombies.
[01:22:47.879 --> 01:22:57.482]  So, this zombie thing, they used it as a cover to get people interested, but it was actually all based around a pandemic scenario where they would have to deal with huge numbers of people.
[01:22:57.542 --> 01:23:00.383]  So, very concerning indeed.
[01:23:00.403 --> 01:23:06.465]  And then, again, on the caller after that, in fact, Jim Garrow, who we had on as a guest quite recently,
[01:23:07.225 --> 01:23:15.332]  He exposed another one of these surveys where the army are asked if they will be willing to fire on Americans and those surveys have been taking place for at least two decades.
[01:23:15.372 --> 01:23:23.999]  We've reported on them numerous times and he had actually had a gun, an illegal gun, planted at his home in Canada, went to prison for a while for it.
[01:23:24.219 --> 01:23:33.127]  So he claims he was targeted for releasing that information that an army, a service member in the army told him that they had been given a survey.
[01:23:33.667 --> 01:23:35.834]  Questioning whether they would fire on Americans.
[01:23:35.874 --> 01:23:38.683]  So this is something that keeps on cropping up again and again.
[01:23:38.703 --> 01:23:41.110]  Has done for at least two decades or more.
[01:23:46.675 --> 01:23:49.578]  Paul, maybe it does make sense that the DOD is getting involved in Ebola.
[01:23:49.598 --> 01:23:57.786]  Maybe they are going to be part of this eradication program where they cordon off areas, and when people try to get out, they're just going to mow them down with machine gun fire.
[01:23:57.806 --> 01:24:01.529]  So maybe that does make sense, even though people are saying it doesn't make sense over on Fox News.
[01:24:01.609 --> 01:24:03.571]  It's Lucas Tomlinson who wrote that.
[01:24:04.412 --> 01:24:09.837]  But yeah, General Martin Dempsey said the Department of Defense's number one priority is combating Ebola.
[01:24:10.077 --> 01:24:11.578]  Right there, combating Ebola.
[01:24:12.319 --> 01:24:27.520]  So, maybe it does make sense that they're having these, and by 2016, you know, we just had a caller, his son was getting training in Idaho, and there was Pentagon reps there and a two-star general, and it was asking people, you know, would you confiscate guns from Americans?
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.621]  Would you fire on Americans?
[01:24:29.844 --> 01:24:32.006]  And some of these guys will do this.
[01:24:32.686 --> 01:24:33.767]  I don't think a lot of them will.
[01:24:33.847 --> 01:24:37.250]  I think they're going to be very surprised at the response they get from our military.
[01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:40.772]  But you know, I mean, you can see what happens in any of these situations.
[01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:44.015]  Ferguson, you know, the cops start firing on people, firing tear gas on people.
[01:24:44.055 --> 01:24:46.557]  Nobody steps up and says, wait a minute, should we be doing this?
[01:24:46.877 --> 01:24:47.738]  These people are unarmed.
[01:24:49.787 --> 01:24:51.668]  You know, maybe we should just go after the people who are looting.
[01:24:52.088 --> 01:24:53.209]  The people who are causing the trouble.
[01:24:53.269 --> 01:24:55.150]  Identify those people and go in and get them.
[01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:58.531]  If you're a protester, you're not going to go attack the police.
[01:24:59.392 --> 01:25:00.653]  Well, until they start attacking you.
[01:25:01.353 --> 01:25:03.914]  Or if you're infected with some sort of weird pandemic.
[01:25:04.174 --> 01:25:05.295]  You know, what are your thoughts on that, Paul?
[01:25:07.441 --> 01:25:11.724]  The fact that they're merely asking the question, will you fire on Americans, is concerning enough.
[01:25:11.784 --> 01:25:21.128]  Then, of course, you've got the report which recently came out where the Army is saying they're not prepared to fight the future combat arena, which will be the main arena of combat.
[01:25:21.588 --> 01:25:26.371]  Quote, mega cities, including New York City, was one of them mentioned in the report.
[01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:34.415]  So they're gearing up the Army to be stationed in occupying and combating insurgents, anti-government extremists and others.
[01:25:34.955 --> 01:25:41.319]  And under medical emergencies with one of the other scenarios in mega cities within the next 20 years.
[01:25:41.379 --> 01:25:55.788]  So then you can tie that back to the concerns about Ebola victims going to highly populated cities like Mexico City, for example, or indeed Paris, because there are many African immigrants in France that go back and forth between these West African countries.
[01:25:56.608 --> 01:26:06.670]  I mean, that is the concern that an Ebola sufferer would land in a major city and it would spread more rapidly because these Western African countries are quite sparsely populated.
[01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:14.611]  Of course, Africa is a huge continent in comparison to these mega cities where it could spread very much more quickly and to a more devastating effect.
[01:26:15.011 --> 01:26:15.691]  Totally agree.
[01:26:15.732 --> 01:26:17.352]  Our next caller is O'Brien.
[01:26:17.412 --> 01:26:18.552]  O'Brien, what is your question?
[01:26:20.572 --> 01:26:21.513]  Yeah.
[01:26:22.173 --> 01:26:23.873]  Basically, if
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:35.344]  The State Department is going to be buying all this hazmat gear for their diplomats.
[01:26:35.464 --> 01:26:39.285]  Wouldn't the CDC need to do that as well?
[01:26:40.845 --> 01:26:43.706]  Well, I bet the CDC probably has a lot of this stuff.
[01:26:44.647 --> 01:26:49.328]  Who knows whether it needs to be upgraded after time, but that is interesting.
[01:26:49.368 --> 01:26:50.168]  Paul, what do you think?
[01:26:50.268 --> 01:26:51.529]  Why does the State Department need this stuff?
[01:26:53.413 --> 01:26:57.255]  I don't know whether they would then hand it on to the public health authorities.
[01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:58.815]  That's what I'm assuming would happen.
[01:26:58.875 --> 01:27:02.057]  But, I mean, I was astonished by the sheer number of it.
[01:27:02.477 --> 01:27:02.057]  160,000.
[01:27:02.617 --> 01:27:06.519]  I'm sure they've already got a lot of them in supply and stock already.
[01:27:07.059 --> 01:27:11.281]  But, you know, they did the same thing with the potassium iodide pills after Fukushima.
[01:27:11.321 --> 01:27:16.203]  So they make sure that they're prepared while the vast majority of Americans are not.
[01:27:16.223 --> 01:27:19.465]  I mean, they rolled back some of those previous measures in
[01:27:20.385 --> 01:27:27.409]  In the context of nuclear power plants, where people who live nearby were given adequate supplies of potassium iodide pills.
[01:27:27.469 --> 01:27:34.654]  So, you know, they're concerned about themselves, not so concerned about the American people, it seems, when they make these large-scale purchases.
[01:27:35.354 --> 01:27:41.458]  Whether they're actually going to foresee a pandemic event is unknown, but they're definitely going to be prepared for it.
[01:27:42.143 --> 01:27:46.509]  If there is a Titanic-like event, I think the government will be the first ones into the lifeboats.
[01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:47.871]  And then it'll be women and children.
[01:27:47.891 --> 01:27:49.072]  And the rich.
[01:27:49.893 --> 01:27:52.577]  And if you're not one of those people, you're going to have to fend for yourself.
[01:27:52.597 --> 01:27:54.820]  You're going to have to prepare.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.661]  Which is why one reason...
[01:27:56.724 --> 01:27:59.407]  It's good to know what colloidal silver does for your body.
[01:27:59.447 --> 01:28:00.989]  I'm just going to do this for a quick plug.
[01:28:01.029 --> 01:28:09.619]  Silver Bullet is one of the Infowars Life family of, I guess, health remedies that you could use for yourself.
[01:28:09.819 --> 01:28:12.422]  You know, I use colloidal silver a lot, personally.
[01:28:12.963 --> 01:28:14.905]  And one thing, I also make a lot of it.
[01:28:15.606 --> 01:28:20.868]  And one thing I do with the Silver Bullet is I take it and I mix it in with my batches that aren't as strong.
[01:28:20.988 --> 01:28:26.830]  This is a 30 parts per million strength, which is very strong, and that's harder to make in your home laboratory.
[01:28:27.311 --> 01:28:30.132]  But I make about 10 parts per million, and then I add that in.
[01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:35.294]  Anytime I get a sniffle or anything, I shoot it up my nose, breathe it in, and that's what I do.
[01:28:35.874 --> 01:28:41.197]  You're welcome to do what you want with it, but Silver Bullet available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:28:41.217 --> 01:28:43.538]  You can use that information as you will.
[01:28:43.558 --> 01:28:53.022]  We're going to be back with more calls, and then we're going to finish up the show with a little NFL worship news for all you people out there watching the ballgames today.
[01:28:53.582 --> 01:28:58.745]  And I think we'll finish up also with a quick chemtrail video that came across our way.
[01:28:58.765 --> 01:28:59.946]  We posted it on Friday.
[01:28:59.966 --> 01:29:01.426]  We're going to tell you what it all means.
[01:29:01.446 --> 01:29:03.247]  It's InfoWars.com's The Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:03.267 --> 01:29:04.388]  I'm your host Rob Duke.
[01:29:04.448 --> 01:29:04.788]  Stay tuned.
[01:29:11.172 --> 01:29:17.274]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forklift situation?
[01:29:17.294 --> 01:29:20.634]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:29:20.734 --> 01:29:22.315]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:28.636]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:29:28.736 --> 01:29:34.638]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:29:34.798 --> 01:29:38.540]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[01:29:41.722 --> 01:29:49.848]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:29:50.108 --> 01:29:52.149]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:53.250]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:29:53.610 --> 01:30:02.353]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:30:14.806 --> 01:30:18.769]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:30:19.069 --> 01:30:20.530]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:32:19.031 --> 01:32:25.254]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:32:26.195 --> 01:32:29.319]  Our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.

[01:33:11.934 --> 01:33:14.815]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:15.535 --> 01:33:19.616]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:40.642]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:42.435 --> 01:33:58.486]  If you're watching us live on PrisonPlanet.tv, we have a video that we posted on September 12th, video undeniable footage of jet aircraft spraying, and you see a jet with, it's got four contrails coming out, and then in the center of those are these on and off plumes that keep going out.
[01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:03.848]  I mean, it is undeniable when you look at that, that they're definitely spraying us with something.
[01:34:04.468 --> 01:34:06.729]  And I was reminded of that from a Drudge Report post.
[01:34:06.809 --> 01:34:10.991]  What was that strange streak of light in the Bay Area sky Friday morning?
[01:34:11.011 --> 01:34:14.573]  This was posted, somebody shot this I believe out in California.
[01:34:15.313 --> 01:34:17.034]  So check that footage out, pass that around.
[01:34:17.074 --> 01:34:19.275]  That is very interesting footage on chemtrail spraying.
[01:34:19.655 --> 01:34:23.476]  And we're going to go to Paul, Peter, Habu, Mark, and Jim in this segment.
[01:34:23.736 --> 01:34:26.918]  But Paul Watson, you wanted to talk about the beheading.
[01:34:27.578 --> 01:34:28.801]  The latest ISIS beheading.
[01:34:28.821 --> 01:34:33.592]  What is your take on this third round of high-quality beheadings that we're now seeing from ISIS?
[01:34:34.517 --> 01:34:46.439]  Well, it's interesting, Rob, because in that New York Times article I mentioned earlier, there was a quote which was, Obama noted that gruesome videos released by ISIS had helped to galvanize public support for action.
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:52.761]  And another quote, he added that ISIS has made a major strategic error by killing them, i.e.
[01:34:52.781 --> 01:35:00.022]  the hostages in the beheading videos, because the anger it generated resulted in the American public's quickly backing military action.
[01:35:00.442 --> 01:35:00.622]  Wow.
[01:35:00.642 --> 01:35:02.943]  So, isn't that interesting?
[01:35:04.966 --> 01:35:17.944]  It's quite brazen that these videos, which apparently are ISIS propaganda videos, are only serving to enhance the US's case for military expansion in the Middle East.
[01:35:19.767 --> 01:35:27.793]  We ask, is it insensitive to question war propaganda given that it could result in the deaths of thousands of innocents if this campaign widens?
[01:35:28.413 --> 01:35:37.660]  And is it insensitive to question evidence cited as accurate by governments that have deliberately faked propaganda in an effort to justify military aggression?
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:45.365]  You know, just three weeks ago, NATO put out these satellite images which claimed Russian troop movements inside Ukraine.
[01:35:45.686 --> 01:35:47.547]  They turned out to be from a video game.
[01:35:49.288 --> 01:35:51.229]  Is it naive of us to question this kind of stuff?
[01:35:51.249 --> 01:35:52.169]  It doesn't get any crazier than that.
[01:35:53.170 --> 01:35:56.952]  But again, with this third video, obviously it's a British hostage.
[01:35:57.332 --> 01:36:02.354]  What's different from the first two is, I mean, you didn't even see a beheading in the first two.
[01:36:02.774 --> 01:36:07.477]  In this one, you don't even see them begin to cut his throat like in the last one.
[01:36:07.897 --> 01:36:09.958]  And you don't see a beheaded body.
[01:36:10.498 --> 01:36:11.779]  Now, this is ISIS.
[01:36:11.839 --> 01:36:14.400]  We know they've killed thousands of people brutally.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:19.183]  There are YouTube videos all over the place of them killing women and children, beheading people.
[01:36:19.583 --> 01:36:26.287]  Why are they censoring their own brutality if that's their main agenda to transmit how ruthless and brutal they are?
[01:36:26.467 --> 01:36:26.867]  Exactly.
[01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:28.528]  We didn't care when they were destroying churches.
[01:36:28.568 --> 01:36:30.049]  We didn't care when they were killing Christians.
[01:36:30.089 --> 01:36:33.150]  We didn't care when they were lining up people into pits and shooting them with guns.
[01:36:33.190 --> 01:36:36.152]  We didn't care when they were lining up people and decapitating them one after another.
[01:36:36.452 --> 01:36:38.413]  There are all those videos that have been out there for months.
[01:36:38.853 --> 01:36:39.614]  We didn't care about that.
[01:36:40.253 --> 01:36:48.162]  We only cared when it was Americans and slickly produced, very slickly produced, propaganda type videos that ISIS started to release.
[01:36:48.222 --> 01:36:48.722]  And what are they doing?
[01:36:48.742 --> 01:36:49.884]  They're taunting the bear now?
[01:36:51.365 --> 01:36:52.567]  And now we're going to strike them?
[01:36:52.707 --> 01:36:53.388]  That's what they want?
[01:36:53.448 --> 01:36:53.648]  No.
[01:36:53.728 --> 01:36:54.509]  They want to take over.
[01:36:54.549 --> 01:36:56.471]  They want to create their own state, in theory.
[01:36:56.871 --> 01:36:57.732]  So why would they do this?
[01:36:57.752 --> 01:37:01.296]  Why would they put out videos to elicit that type of response from the United States?
[01:37:02.037 --> 01:37:02.438]  Who knows?
[01:37:02.458 --> 01:37:04.680]  We're going to go to Paul in New Jersey.
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:08.384]  Paul, what is your question for either myself or Paul Joseph Watson in England?
[01:37:08.404 --> 01:37:10.566]  About the Ukrainian thing.
[01:37:10.666 --> 01:37:11.607]  That's all set up.
[01:37:11.787 --> 01:37:12.909]  They want to get rid of Putin.
[01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:16.993]  Putin's got his gas lines and they want his gas lines.
[01:37:18.214 --> 01:37:20.036]  Oh sure, it's always about resources.
[01:37:20.056 --> 01:37:22.879]  Putin wants to get the Russian people out of Ukraine.
[01:37:22.999 --> 01:37:24.541]  He didn't invade Ukraine.
[01:37:25.393 --> 01:37:26.574]  That's all the EU.
[01:37:26.614 --> 01:37:28.576]  They want Ukraine to join the EU.
[01:37:28.596 --> 01:37:32.339]  And Putin wants them to be a sovereign state.
[01:37:32.919 --> 01:37:34.641]  That's the whole thing there.
[01:37:34.661 --> 01:37:38.404]  As far as the other stuff, welcome to the New World Order.
[01:37:38.424 --> 01:37:40.045]  I call it the New World Odor.
[01:37:40.146 --> 01:37:40.686]  It stinks.
[01:37:41.507 --> 01:37:42.468]  It definitely stinks.
[01:37:43.108 --> 01:37:44.009]  I totally agree with you on that.
[01:37:44.029 --> 01:37:44.950]  Paul, you got anything else to add?
[01:37:46.348 --> 01:37:54.012]  Yeah, I mean the major thing with Russia recently was again this huge gas pipeline deal they signed with China, the biggest ever.
[01:37:54.512 --> 01:38:02.516]  Another example of how they're building this multi-polar world system in opposition to the unipolar world system of NATO, the US and Europe.
[01:38:02.556 --> 01:38:12.461]  So that's what it's all about and definitely Ukraine now they've got a truce at the moment but these sanctions keep on getting more aggressive even though Putin agreed to the truce.
[01:38:12.521 --> 01:38:15.203]  So they only keep turning the volume up more and more.
[01:38:15.666 --> 01:38:19.609]  Yeah, it's only a matter of time before it breaks out over in that region once again.
[01:38:19.969 --> 01:38:22.171]  Peter Washington, what is your question?
[01:38:22.211 --> 01:38:25.113]  It looks like you have a Smedley Butler, Paul Joseph Watson correction.
[01:38:26.013 --> 01:38:26.594]  Can you hear me?
[01:38:26.714 --> 01:38:27.234]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:38:28.015 --> 01:38:35.340]  Okay, Mr. Paul, I think you're a good reporter, but even Homer has been known to nod.
[01:38:36.681 --> 01:38:41.845]  I think Smedley Butler was either a communist or a man who hated
[01:38:42.532 --> 01:38:43.152]  Rich people.
[01:38:43.412 --> 01:38:47.254]  The head of that committee was Dick Steen, who was a communist agent.
[01:38:47.294 --> 01:38:53.638]  He was paid $1,000 a month by the GPU, which was the former name of the KGB.
[01:38:54.818 --> 01:38:56.039]  New York Times laughed at him.
[01:38:57.039 --> 01:38:59.581]  New York Times was owned and operated by Jews.
[01:39:00.681 --> 01:39:07.925]  Anything that reminded them of Hitler, they would go and investigate, and even
[01:39:08.533 --> 01:39:12.475]  I think Smedley Brutler predates Hitler by at least 20 years.
[01:39:14.356 --> 01:39:18.917]  Even if there wasn't much to it, they'd play it up because they liked FDR.
[01:39:20.338 --> 01:39:20.938]  Fascism?
[01:39:21.319 --> 01:39:22.579]  FDR was fine with that.
[01:39:22.759 --> 01:39:24.600]  The NRA was his first program.
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:30.943]  It was turned down by the Supreme Court and everybody knew the NRA was inspired by that.
[01:39:31.003 --> 01:39:32.783]  Mussolini wasn't popular for another year.
[01:39:33.264 --> 01:39:33.584]  Hitler?
[01:39:35.518 --> 01:39:37.740]  A man with a Charlie Chaplin mustache.
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:39.581]  Now, some foreigners were popular.
[01:39:39.641 --> 01:39:45.645]  Ronald Coleman, Valentino Garbo, but not Charlie Chaplin as a leader.
[01:39:47.606 --> 01:39:50.528]  I think that if this guy had... Hello?
[01:39:50.888 --> 01:39:53.830]  Yeah, so what is your correction about Smedley Butler?
[01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:54.830]  You think he was a communist?
[01:39:55.651 --> 01:39:59.733]  He was either a communist or a man who hated rich people.
[01:39:59.873 --> 01:40:00.794]  Paul, what do you think about that?
[01:40:02.768 --> 01:40:14.012]  The call of referring to the business plot which was a proven conspiracy in 1934 by this group of Bush's grandfather was one of them.
[01:40:14.252 --> 01:40:22.115]  Conspirators to overthrow President Roosevelt and they tried to get Smedley Butler to lead an army coup which would overthrow the President.
[01:40:22.615 --> 01:40:27.259]  But he ended up blowing the whistle on it by talking to the House of Representatives Committee.
[01:40:27.599 --> 01:40:34.665]  So it was one of those conspiracy theories which at the time the New York Times dismissed as non-existent, which turned out to be true.
[01:40:34.745 --> 01:40:41.450]  It was confirmed by the investigative committee that this conspiracy did indeed take place to try and overthrow Roosevelt.
[01:40:41.931 --> 01:40:48.356]  Whether it was some communist aspect to it, I don't know, but I know that it was a confirmed plot at the time and that was in 1934.
[01:40:50.231 --> 01:40:50.591]  All right.
[01:40:50.671 --> 01:40:51.852]  Hey, Peter, thanks for the call.
[01:40:51.892 --> 01:40:53.293]  Haboo in Wisconsin.
[01:40:53.713 --> 01:40:55.774]  You want to talk about Obama's speech in Syrian sovereignty?
[01:40:55.814 --> 01:40:56.174]  Go ahead.
[01:40:57.655 --> 01:40:57.815]  Yeah.
[01:40:57.835 --> 01:40:58.076]  Hello.
[01:40:58.116 --> 01:40:59.316]  Thank you for the opportunity.
[01:41:00.477 --> 01:41:02.118]  Let me just say this about Paul Watson.
[01:41:02.158 --> 01:41:14.325]  I think his take on foreign policy matters is spot on and unlike the American interpretation, but we'll just leave it at that.
[01:41:15.265 --> 01:41:17.807]  What I'm calling about in particular is
[01:41:18.976 --> 01:41:36.748]  You know, President Obama's notions about being able to strike Syria no matter what, meaning not working with them, just going ahead and striking at will, and perhaps a backdoor into getting a regime change taken care of.
[01:41:37.569 --> 01:41:48.116]  You know, the Syrians, and I'm sure the Russians have something to say about that, and what they're going to do is, and this is one scenario, the Russians can thwart those plans by
[01:41:49.150 --> 01:42:12.474]  But by announcing that they've been called in by the Syrian government, which is not too far from the mark, and then set up a false flag, have the FSA, the Free Syrian Army, attack them, so to speak, and then, you know, they are going to be attacking these ISIS and ISIL cretins, and then we'll see how the U.S.
[01:42:12.494 --> 01:42:16.875]  can just go and bomb Syria, having those SU-300
[01:42:19.443 --> 01:42:29.608]  Yeah, and all it's going to take is somebody with some of these missiles that they got from Benghazi to shoot down an American plane.
[01:42:29.628 --> 01:42:31.549]  They just say, hey, it was the Syrian army.
[01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:32.770]  We're going to go after them.
[01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:34.711]  We've got to take out Assad now so we can take out ISIS.
[01:42:34.751 --> 01:42:36.392]  That's going to be the war cry.
[01:42:37.012 --> 01:42:38.133]  Paul, what do you have to say about that?
[01:42:39.144 --> 01:42:42.805]  Well, the Syrian air defense is a hell of a lot stronger than Libya's.
[01:42:42.865 --> 01:42:48.166]  I mean, obviously we had airstrikes on Libya with basically zero actual response.
[01:42:48.206 --> 01:42:54.968]  But in terms of Syria, they've said that if the United States flies warplanes over their territory, they will consider it an act of war.
[01:42:55.368 --> 01:42:57.049]  So this is what they're trying to provoke.
[01:42:57.129 --> 01:43:01.090]  They're trying to provoke a response to justify an expanded bombing targeting Assad.
[01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:03.052]  That's right, and we're going to be right back.
[01:43:03.092 --> 01:43:05.415]  We've got two more callers and we're going to finish up with some news.
[01:43:05.435 --> 01:43:07.017]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:07.057 --> 01:43:07.858]  I'm your host Rob Doo.
[01:43:08.179 --> 01:43:09.521]  Riding Shotgun, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:43:11.223 --> 01:43:14.745]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:43:14.885 --> 01:43:18.848]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:43:19.168 --> 01:43:20.629]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:43:20.949 --> 01:43:28.534]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:43:28.814 --> 01:43:29.655]  But for how long?
[01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:36.219]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:43:36.599 --> 01:43:39.401]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:45.035]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Supermail and then when Superfemale came out, tell us what happened.
[01:43:45.335 --> 01:43:49.956]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:43:50.116 --> 01:43:51.116]  Talk about the effects.
[01:43:51.436 --> 01:43:52.916]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:43:52.936 --> 01:43:54.557]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:43:54.877 --> 01:43:55.917]  I feel like I look better.
[01:43:55.977 --> 01:43:56.617]  I feel better.
[01:43:56.697 --> 01:43:57.797]  I feel sexier.
[01:43:58.098 --> 01:43:58.478]  I love it.
[01:43:58.718 --> 01:44:01.638]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[01:44:31.958 --> 01:44:34.739]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:44:34.819 --> 01:44:37.880]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:40.281]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:44:40.341 --> 01:44:40.961]  These people are
[01:44:40.981 --> 01:44:41.862]  They're assaulting us!
[01:44:41.882 --> 01:44:44.124]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:44:44.724 --> 01:44:46.365]  They're never going to stop.
[01:44:46.646 --> 01:44:50.549]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:45:06.742 --> 01:45:07.482]  You can feel it.
[01:45:10.482 --> 01:45:20.006]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:45:20.126 --> 01:45:29.890]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:32.971]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:45:33.191 --> 01:45:33.812]  I think so.
[01:45:48.148 --> 01:45:48.408]  We're good.
[01:46:10.225 --> 01:46:17.308]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:46:17.388 --> 01:46:19.549]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:46:19.730 --> 01:46:24.852]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:46:25.032 --> 01:46:30.054]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:46:30.195 --> 01:46:33.216]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:46:33.496 --> 01:46:37.358]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:46:37.578 --> 01:46:41.820]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:51.946]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:46:52.126 --> 01:46:54.647]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[01:46:54.807 --> 01:46:56.208]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:46:56.348 --> 01:46:58.929]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:29.645 --> 01:47:35.211]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[01:47:35.832 --> 01:47:41.578]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[01:47:41.598 --> 01:47:44.641]  It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[01:47:44.962 --> 01:47:48.786]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[01:47:55.143 --> 01:47:57.884]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:58.504 --> 01:48:12.750]  That's right, President Devilhorns, we have to pay the bills that we owe, and we sure are racking up lots of bills here in the United States, and we've taken a record number of tax receipts in this year so far, so the plan's working perfectly.
[01:48:12.970 --> 01:48:21.293]  You're bleeding the American public dry, and you're going to start wars in other countries and send our men off to fight imaginary enemies that we actually fund and build up.
[01:48:22.253 --> 01:48:23.053]  That's kind of how it works.
[01:48:23.073 --> 01:48:24.414]  That's kind of it in a nutshell.
[01:48:25.094 --> 01:48:33.898]  We've got a couple more callers we're going to go to, and I'm going to bring up some NFL news here on NFL Worship Day that we have in the United States, and I guess it's moving over into Britain.
[01:48:34.638 --> 01:48:36.479]  But let's go with Mark in Cali.
[01:48:36.499 --> 01:48:40.980]  He wants to talk about in-game and the Pianka comments, which is something we didn't cover with all this Ebola news.
[01:48:41.201 --> 01:48:42.581]  And thanks for bringing that up, Mark.
[01:48:42.701 --> 01:48:43.001]  Go ahead.
[01:48:46.443 --> 01:48:47.023]  Are you there, Mark?
[01:48:48.527 --> 01:48:49.288]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:48:49.368 --> 01:49:00.035]  I was watching Endgame once again on YouTube, and about two hours into it, it gets into Professor Pionkin's foolish statement, wicked statement.
[01:49:00.155 --> 01:49:01.656]  Yeah, he's a nice guy, isn't he?
[01:49:02.837 --> 01:49:08.700]  Yeah, and what's amazing is that anybody agreed with him, and yet there was many that did.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:13.103]  They gave him a standing ovation instead of said, you know, booed him down.
[01:49:14.364 --> 01:49:15.525]  Kill more people!
[01:49:15.565 --> 01:49:16.446]  Kill more people!
[01:49:18.107 --> 01:49:18.347]  Right.
[01:49:19.076 --> 01:49:37.428]  Now look, one good idea where we can spread this is a policeman in San Francisco told me to put Alex Jones on my t-shirt so I could go into the Board of Supervisors meeting because they have some rule you can't carry a sign, but to circumvent that, you know, you can put on the InfoWars thing or
[01:49:38.448 --> 01:49:43.289]  Mine just asked people to Google Alex Jones and John DeCamp on the Franklin cover-up.
[01:49:43.489 --> 01:49:43.729]  Sure.
[01:49:43.909 --> 01:49:45.049]  Put it on front and back.
[01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:47.230]  You know, people do read the t-shirts.
[01:49:47.490 --> 01:49:48.090]  Google Building 7.
[01:49:48.170 --> 01:49:49.050]  That's a good way to do it.
[01:49:49.630 --> 01:49:51.631]  Google fluoride on the water supply.
[01:49:51.651 --> 01:49:57.152]  There's all kind of things you can put on a t-shirt and anybody can do it and that is a great way to wake people up.
[01:49:57.172 --> 01:50:01.773]  We also have some great t-shirts at InfoWarsStore.com that you can get.
[01:50:01.813 --> 01:50:03.113]  We have a new Molon Labe.
[01:50:03.713 --> 01:50:05.594]  You get people to ask you, what the heck does that mean?
[01:50:05.694 --> 01:50:08.114]  Spartan helmet with 50 Cal bullets on it.
[01:50:08.355 --> 01:50:08.995]  And that's a new one.
[01:50:09.015 --> 01:50:10.575]  And we've got all kinds of shirts that can wake people up.
[01:50:10.915 --> 01:50:13.616]  One that I like to wear is, there's poison in your water supply.
[01:50:13.696 --> 01:50:15.037]  That'll get people asking questions.
[01:50:15.437 --> 01:50:16.997]  Why is there a drop with a skull in it?
[01:50:17.557 --> 01:50:19.698]  You know, that will definitely wake some people up.
[01:50:19.738 --> 01:50:25.940]  So if you're out there right now on your computer, go to InfoWareStore.com and check out our selection of shirts that are guaranteed to wake people up.
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:27.121]  Another good one.
[01:50:27.781 --> 01:50:30.323]  An old favorite is the Hitler-Stalin mouth shirt.
[01:50:30.744 --> 01:50:32.926]  Mass murderers agree gun control works.
[01:50:33.286 --> 01:50:35.948]  I mean, you can't get any plainer than that, people.
[01:50:36.168 --> 01:50:40.872]  Gun control works, especially if you're a dictator and want to get rid of your population.
[01:50:41.433 --> 01:50:42.774]  Paul, anything else you want to add to that?
[01:50:43.846 --> 01:50:45.968]  No, I also love to see the graffiti.
[01:50:46.388 --> 01:50:55.717]  Of course we get, you know, emails on a weekly or monthly basis where Infowars.com is plastered all over the place, of course in legal and lawful areas, don't forget.
[01:50:55.737 --> 01:50:57.598]  Of course, that's the only places we'd recommend.
[01:50:57.618 --> 01:50:58.379]  Keep them coming!
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:07.525]  Yeah, and we have a guy in New Orleans who drives around, rides around on a bike with a sign that even has the Alex Jones Show playing on it.
[01:51:07.625 --> 01:51:10.346]  So, you know, kudos to all the people out there that are getting the word out.
[01:51:10.567 --> 01:51:13.088]  But it's not just, you know, here at InfoWars.
[01:51:13.148 --> 01:51:15.129]  You can also be a leader in your area.
[01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:16.530]  You know, start organizing people.
[01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:18.871]  Start getting together and putting out your own media.
[01:51:18.892 --> 01:51:19.712]  Put out your own videos.
[01:51:19.752 --> 01:51:20.352]  It's not that hard.
[01:51:20.593 --> 01:51:22.634]  Go confront your own politicians and put it up.
[01:51:23.354 --> 01:51:24.155]  I don't think so.
[01:51:41.263 --> 01:51:42.784]  Well, here's the deal, sir.
[01:51:42.884 --> 01:51:43.184]  I love you.
[01:51:43.245 --> 01:51:44.205]  And I love your whole team.
[01:51:44.265 --> 01:51:44.746]  This is for real.
[01:51:44.766 --> 01:51:45.326]  This is not a joke.
[01:52:11.505 --> 01:52:18.809]  And, uh, so anyway, all I wanted to say, I'm from Georgia and got me a little Southern Accent because I'm from Georgia.
[01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:22.831]  But I am a personal fan of both of you.
[01:52:23.572 --> 01:52:26.714]  A tremendous personal fan of both of you.
[01:52:26.734 --> 01:52:28.535]  But anyway, I just wanted to preface for that.
[01:52:28.555 --> 01:52:29.455]  Here's the deal.
[01:52:30.056 --> 01:52:39.561]  I have, as you probably both have, I have examined my own mind and I will tell you, I don't ever want to hear again
[01:52:40.342 --> 01:52:49.044]  That they can predict 100% or 90, whatever, 95% of all human activity.
[01:52:49.444 --> 01:52:56.005]  I do understand that when it comes to what people call the zombies, the sheeple, whatever, I understand that that could be the case.
[01:52:56.465 --> 01:52:59.286]  But I gotta tell ya, that they don't know what I'm gonna do.
[01:53:10.806 --> 01:53:11.206]  No, sir.
[01:53:11.246 --> 01:53:11.746]  Not anymore.
[01:53:11.826 --> 01:53:14.627]  I was Witness I on Twitter.
[01:53:15.167 --> 01:53:18.287]  I was my own name on Facebook.
[01:53:18.528 --> 01:53:19.988]  I got rid of both of those things.
[01:53:21.008 --> 01:53:30.290]  But, listen, I mean, you know, like John Hancock, I hope they record what I say because I want them to know that, hey, Jack, I'm not a joke.
[01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:31.890]  So you want to come here?
[01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:33.290]  You got a problem.
[01:53:33.831 --> 01:53:34.111]  OK?
[01:53:34.791 --> 01:53:36.191]  I'm not playing around.
[01:53:37.494 --> 01:53:39.436]  This is life or death for me and my family.
[01:53:39.456 --> 01:53:40.657]  We don't play this.
[01:53:41.598 --> 01:53:44.380]  And thankfully, my wife is awake.
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:45.981]  My stepson's awake.
[01:53:46.641 --> 01:53:48.222]  We know what's going on.
[01:53:48.803 --> 01:53:53.286]  And I will tell you that you are the number one news source on the planet.
[01:53:54.207 --> 01:54:00.091]  I have searched, I searched and searched with my own questions and I found you.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.561]  Well, we appreciate that.
[01:54:03.661 --> 01:54:20.391]  Let me tell you, there's nothing better than I like to get up in the morning and look at the news and be able to actually see the programming that's happening and then be able to come into work and we create videos and we put on newscasts and help people decipher what's really being said in the news.
[01:54:20.511 --> 01:54:30.858]  Paul Joseph Watson, my hat's off to you because you really do, day in and day out, you're writing articles, you're putting out videos, you really are on the front lines along with all of us here in the Central
[01:54:31.058 --> 01:54:31.778]  What's your comment?
[01:54:47.423 --> 01:54:48.564]  That's exactly it, Rob.
[01:54:48.584 --> 01:54:52.867]  I mean, there's the old cliche, you know, don't you get downhearted about all this terrible news?
[01:54:53.307 --> 01:54:54.848]  Well, no, because knowledge is power.
[01:54:54.889 --> 01:55:05.877]  If you're aware of the news, if you're aware of what's happening around you in terms of politics, geopolitics, health, financial freedom, you're able to make better personal choices about your own life.
[01:55:05.957 --> 01:55:08.859]  So it's not a downhearted thing.
[01:55:08.919 --> 01:55:10.160]  It's self-empowerment.
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:13.222]  Having this knowledge to make better choices about your life.
[01:55:13.282 --> 01:55:17.766]  So eventually, you know, it benefits everybody to be more aware of these kind of subjects.
[01:55:17.806 --> 01:55:20.848]  So it's not a morbid thing to do what we do.
[01:55:20.928 --> 01:55:22.009]  It's an empowering thing.
[01:55:22.289 --> 01:55:23.571]  And it's a normal everyday thing.
[01:55:23.671 --> 01:55:24.611]  I was in the Boy Scouts.
[01:55:24.671 --> 01:55:26.413]  I'm actually an Eagle Scout.
[01:55:26.453 --> 01:55:27.474]  The motto is be prepared.
[01:55:27.854 --> 01:55:28.254]  That's it.
[01:55:29.255 --> 01:55:29.976]  It's two words.
[01:55:30.276 --> 01:55:31.177]  That's all you have to know.
[01:55:31.397 --> 01:55:32.177]  Be prepared.
[01:55:33.115 --> 01:55:33.375]  Okay?
[01:55:34.016 --> 01:55:35.557]  That's why I have a lot of crap in my house.
[01:55:35.657 --> 01:55:36.418]  Because I'm prepared.
[01:55:37.719 --> 01:55:38.760]  Not because I'm a pack rat.
[01:55:39.641 --> 01:55:44.325]  And that's why, back in the day, I remember listening to an Alex Jones Show a long time ago.
[01:55:44.385 --> 01:55:47.727]  It was like 2002 or 2003, and they were talking about making colloidal silver.
[01:55:47.807 --> 01:55:52.031]  And I went and bought off his sponsor, a colloidal silver generator, and I used that thing for years.
[01:55:52.071 --> 01:55:52.932]  I finally burned it out.
[01:55:53.692 --> 01:55:59.878]  And it's because I wanted to make my own medicine so I didn't have to go to the doctor every time I got a sniffle to get an antibiotic that I know wasn't really helping me.
[01:56:00.612 --> 01:56:02.452]  Maybe it was attacking what was inside of me.
[01:56:02.472 --> 01:56:03.693]  It was also attacking everything.
[01:56:03.733 --> 01:56:05.213]  Antibiotic means anti-life.
[01:56:06.253 --> 01:56:06.873]  I mean, crazy.
[01:56:06.913 --> 01:56:07.913]  Jim, you got anything else to add?
[01:56:08.253 --> 01:56:09.274]  Are you still on the line with us?
[01:56:09.294 --> 01:56:09.734]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:10.014 --> 01:56:10.434]  Go ahead.
[01:56:10.514 --> 01:56:16.395]  I will tell you and I want to give you and your whole team and everybody involved the kudos.
[01:56:16.835 --> 01:56:19.876]  I will tell you, I suffered weight gain.
[01:56:20.476 --> 01:56:24.796]  I had high blood pressure and it was beyond second stage hypertension.
[01:56:24.816 --> 01:56:25.337]  Okay?
[01:56:25.937 --> 01:56:27.497]  And with you guys' help,
[01:56:28.582 --> 01:56:36.364]  I literally have lost, I'm down to, gosh, it's almost embarrassing.
[01:56:36.464 --> 01:56:40.906]  I'm down to 187 pounds from 240 pounds.
[01:56:40.966 --> 01:56:41.246]  Wow.
[01:56:41.486 --> 01:56:43.586]  That's my high school weight, 187 pounds.
[01:56:43.626 --> 01:56:44.066]  That's good.
[01:56:44.307 --> 01:56:45.087]  That's me too.
[01:56:45.787 --> 01:56:46.047]  Yeah.
[01:56:46.167 --> 01:56:49.388]  And so here I sit and I'm ready.
[01:56:50.388 --> 01:56:52.069]  Whatever comes, I can take it.
[01:56:52.429 --> 01:56:53.109]  I'm going to face it.
[01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.849]  My mind is on track.
[01:56:57.413 --> 01:56:59.654]  You guys have helped me and I love you so much.
[01:57:00.014 --> 01:57:08.917]  We appreciate you, Jim, and all the other Info Warriors out there that tune in and spread the broadcast around and make their own YouTube videos and send them to us and send us their tips.
[01:57:08.957 --> 01:57:10.157]  I mean, we've learned a lot today.
[01:57:10.237 --> 01:57:12.078]  We've learned a hell of a lot.
[01:57:12.098 --> 01:57:18.039]  I mean, it's amazing the amount of information you could put out there in a two-hour broadcast and help people wake up.
[01:57:18.059 --> 01:57:19.320]  This one last bit of information.
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:22.761]  Did you know the NFL has their own FBI-type network?
[01:57:22.941 --> 01:57:24.941]  This is out of the Washington Post.
[01:57:24.961 --> 01:57:27.022]  The NFL's elaborate security network is supposed to protect the
[01:57:27.022 --> 01:57:27.202]  I don't
[01:57:46.776 --> 01:57:51.039]  A SportsCenter host on Ray Rice, we need to reprogram the way we raise men.
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:58.745]  Because this one guy hits his fiance, we need to suddenly pour millions of dollars into all these education... No, you know what it takes?
