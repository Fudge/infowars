[00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:06.132]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.132 --> 00:00:07.912]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:09.653]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:11.254]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.254 --> 00:00:12.794]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.976]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:21.078]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.053 --> 00:00:25.714]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:27.956]  I'm David Knight and I'll be your host today.
[00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:31.599]  Alex will be joining us at 1230 Central.
[00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.503]  So we're going to talk about the significance of what happened this weekend.
[00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:37.464]  An amazing trip.
[00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:39.105]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:43.949]  Thank you for standing behind us, for standing behind InfoWars so that we can go to sites like this.
[00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.791]  Thank you especially for your prayers.
[00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:47.912]  It was a very dangerous situation.
[00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:49.313]  It was touch and go there for a while.
[00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:57.762]  But I tell you what, it was, and you're going to see some clips that we haven't aired yet about the Bundy family and about the standoff.
[00:00:57.762 --> 00:01:04.128]  These are men who are meek, but they have backbones of steel.
[00:01:04.128 --> 00:01:05.909]  They are the kind of men we need to see.
[00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.791]  I tell you what, talking to Cliven Bundy,
[00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:11.874]  It reminded me so much of Ron Paul in so many ways.
[00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:15.216]  Not a big, brash person, not tooting his horn.
[00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:19.738]  And he is not a lawbreaker getting away with breaking the law.
[00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:21.719]  We didn't help somebody to do that.
[00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.601]  We've had people leave comments like that.
[00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:31.025]  I'm going to tell you how to distinguish between real law and between law that is enacted without representation.
[00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:35.427]  You know, we had a revolution in this country about taxation without representation.
[00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:41.150]  We not only have taxation without representation, we now have regulation without representation.
[00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.474]  And if you don't understand that, in this particular case, they're going to get you in every aspect, every walk of life.
[00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:54.017]  It doesn't matter if you're not a rancher and don't have grazing rights, don't have water rights to some land.
[00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:56.158]  If you've got any property at all,
[00:01:56.798 --> 00:02:01.281]  Your property is at stake if you don't stand for other people's property rights.
[00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:08.165]  If the government can come in, an unelected government, have you ever seen BLM on any of your ballots?
[00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:09.206]  I haven't.
[00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:14.269]  Have you ever seen, have you ever had a chance to vote for an EPA official or an IRS official?
[00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.431]  Yet they have the power, they claim, to regulate our lives.
[00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:18.912]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:20.453]  Alex is going to be joining us at 1230.
[00:02:22.122 --> 00:02:24.704]  Central, Josh is going to be joining us at noon.
[00:02:24.704 --> 00:02:25.665]  Josh was the cameraman.
[00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:26.806]  You typically didn't see it.
[00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:28.907]  He was there with me the entire time.
[00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:32.069]  We want you to hear from us what we saw.
[00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.170]  We're going to tell you what we saw.
[00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.612]  You know how you can tell what really happened there?
[00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:38.254]  The mainstream media has got its own narrative that it's developing.
[00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:38.995]  They're pushing back.
[00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:41.176]  They're trying to criminalize the Bundys.
[00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:44.539]  They're trying to make them into, well, let's see.
[00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.139]  I've seen things.
[00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:50.943]  I've seen them called Mormons, rich white ranchers, a lot of personal invective.
[00:02:51.784 --> 00:02:54.106]  That was not the spirit we saw there.
[00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:57.008]  They're not, first of all, very rich.
[00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:03.933]  And we had people from all over the West that descended on that place to stand with them in support.
[00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.115]  And we stood them down.
[00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:07.957]  We didn't have to resort to gunfire.
[00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:10.699]  We had, some people had guns to back it up with it.
[00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.682]  But he told people not even to bring the guns, not to be afraid of them.
[00:03:14.682 --> 00:03:15.582]  We were in the right.
[00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:19.268]  We looked them in the eye, and they blinked.
[00:03:19.268 --> 00:03:21.311]  This can be done everywhere.
[00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:23.253]  And we're going to talk about how it can be done everywhere.
[00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:32.644]  And I'm not talking about people just showing up every time there's a crisis, because the government is attacking so many people, so many places, that we can't be at every place.
[00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:36.868]  And we're going to play a speech from Ammon Bundy, one of the sons.
[00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:41.924]  Talking about what it was like to see his country turned into martial law.
[00:03:41.924 --> 00:03:47.227]  The place that he had grown up in, that his father, his grandfather, his great-grandfather had grown up in.
[00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.328]  For generations they were there.
[00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:52.190]  They had never seen, they were always free to roam the land.
[00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.714]  And yet one day, they find that there's a military operation pointed at them.
[00:03:57.714 --> 00:04:00.296]  Guns, snipers on the hills, pointing their guns at them.
[00:04:01.288 --> 00:04:02.808]  Could it happen to you?
[00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:07.170]  Yes, it will happen to you if you don't stand up for the principles that are involved here.
[00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.390]  So we're going to talk about the principles involved.
[00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.092]  We've also had a tie with the crony capitalism, the corruption of Harry Reid and others.
[00:04:15.092 --> 00:04:18.093]  And we're going to be joined by Jerome Corsi in the third hour.
[00:04:18.093 --> 00:04:22.494]  If you think that this is over with the Chinese, I don't think it's over.
[00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:23.835]  It's also not over with the Bundys.
[00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:26.996]  We understand that even though there's been a victory in the Battle of Bunkerville,
[00:04:27.856 --> 00:04:29.556]  This is just a battle.
[00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:30.857]  The war is not over.
[00:04:30.857 --> 00:04:32.417]  It's not over for the Bundys.
[00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:34.458]  It's not over for America.
[00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:37.498]  We have to talk about how we're going to do that, and we can all do that.
[00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:38.318]  There's things that we can do.
[00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:45.200]  We're going to be talking to Jerome Corsi, though, about how the Chinese are going everywhere in this country, and it's not just in that area.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.380]  Stay tuned.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.341]  We've got an exciting show.
[00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:48.921]  A lot of clips that you haven't seen yet.
[00:04:59.983 --> 00:05:07.246]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:09.607]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:05:09.607 --> 00:05:14.969]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:20.071]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:23.593]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:05:23.593 --> 00:05:27.715]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:05:27.715 --> 00:05:32.118]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:42.484]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:46.726]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:53.549]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:59.331]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:10.315]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:17.600]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.504]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:06:22.504 --> 00:06:29.289]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:36.374]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:43.461]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:47.965]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:06:47.965 --> 00:06:51.188]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:06:51.408 --> 00:06:57.630]  We will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.111]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:03.553]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:05.974]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:07:05.974 --> 00:07:14.217]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:07:14.557 --> 00:07:30.608]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:07:30.888 --> 00:07:38.914]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:38.914 --> 00:07:45.258]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:07:45.258 --> 00:07:54.005]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:58.168]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality.

[00:08:10.451 --> 00:08:16.513]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:21.494]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[00:08:21.494 --> 00:08:26.356]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[00:08:26.356 --> 00:08:28.356]  It's not about food.
[00:08:28.356 --> 00:08:30.977]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[00:08:37.622 --> 00:08:48.886]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:49.486]  I'm David Knight.
[00:08:49.486 --> 00:08:50.327]  I'll be your host today.
[00:08:50.327 --> 00:08:53.168]  Alex will be joining us at 1230 Central.
[00:08:53.168 --> 00:08:55.469]  Josh is going to be here at the top of the next hour.
[00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:57.810]  We're going to talk about what we saw there.
[00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:09.013]  And if you think that this is over because the E&N Chinese company said that they're going to stop this solar project back in June, it is not over with them.
[00:09:09.013 --> 00:09:16.738]  We're going to have Jerome Corsi on at the top of the third hour, and he's going to talk about the deals being made with the Chinese to loot the entire country.
[00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:22.119]  Even if they don't come back to this place, there are many, many other areas where they're going to go.
[00:09:22.119 --> 00:09:30.364]  A lot of people missed the point that this was about the area that the Bundy family was in was a mitigation area.
[00:09:30.364 --> 00:09:34.927]  If you understand the way these people work with carbon credits, this is what they were doing.
[00:09:34.927 --> 00:09:41.712]  They were going to say, we're going to destroy the environment in this one area, but we're going to pull up this other area, make it extra pristine.
[00:09:41.712 --> 00:09:45.274]  That's going to be the mitigation for our solar projects that we're putting in with people.
[00:09:45.274 --> 00:09:47.416]  So we're going to be talking to Jerome Corsi on the third hour.
[00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:54.562]  About the crony capitalism, about the corruption, about the looting of the American people.
[00:09:54.562 --> 00:09:59.066]  The government should not be owning these lands.
[00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:09.896]  Under the Constitution, they should be not owning anything more than just a 10-mile square area in Washington and the area that they need for forts and other things.
[00:10:09.896 --> 00:10:12.399]  Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17, look it up.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.722]  However, what they're doing in the West is they're owning vast swaths of land.
[00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:20.683]  85, 90% in Nevada.
[00:10:20.683 --> 00:10:22.124]  They continually accumulate more.
[00:10:22.124 --> 00:10:23.624]  They're looking to get 90,000 acres here in Texas.
[00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:28.192]  What are they doing with this land?
[00:10:28.192 --> 00:10:30.933]  They're declaring it to be the king's land.
[00:10:30.933 --> 00:10:31.794]  Pushing people off.
[00:10:31.794 --> 00:10:35.696]  People who have had rights, property rights, on that land.
[00:10:35.696 --> 00:10:39.258]  Now the Bundys never said that they owned the land.
[00:10:39.258 --> 00:10:41.979]  They did have rights on that land.
[00:10:41.979 --> 00:10:43.400]  They had grazing rights.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.041]  They had water rights.
[00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:47.162]  Those rights needed to be abrogated.
[00:10:47.162 --> 00:10:49.223]  They needed to be pushed off before
[00:10:50.023 --> 00:10:54.425]  Harry Reid and others like Obama could sell this area off.
[00:10:54.425 --> 00:10:57.306]  They're after surface rights for solar projects.
[00:10:57.306 --> 00:10:58.907]  They're after mineral rights.
[00:10:58.907 --> 00:11:00.167]  They're after oil rights.
[00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:07.810]  They're after all kinds of things in that area that they're going to sell off to large corporations, most of them multinational, many of them Chinese.
[00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.671]  That's what Jerome Corsi is going to be talking about.
[00:11:10.091 --> 00:11:13.713]  And then, of course, the corrupt politicians get their gratuities at the end.
[00:11:13.713 --> 00:11:16.015]  That's fundamentally what this is about.
[00:11:16.015 --> 00:11:18.396]  And we're going to talk about how this whole thing rolled out.
[00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:21.818]  But before we do, and there you see on the screen, there's Harry Reid.
[00:11:21.818 --> 00:11:26.461]  They've actually broken a solar project, broken ground on it.
[00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:35.386]  This was an announcement that went out on February the 19th, and they announced that picture that you just saw up there with Harry Reid breaking ground on the project.
[00:11:35.386 --> 00:11:37.528]  That is the first solar project.
[00:11:38.408 --> 00:11:41.871]  And that press release went out on March the 21st.
[00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:42.832]  They said today U.S.
[00:11:42.832 --> 00:11:49.298]  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid joined representatives from the Moapa Band of Paiutes, executives from First Solar, etc.
[00:11:49.298 --> 00:11:55.164]  That is a multinational company as well that has put up two large solar projects.
[00:11:55.164 --> 00:11:56.705]  One in California, one in Nevada.
[00:11:57.606 --> 00:12:01.168]  And let me read you from their press release back on February the 19th.
[00:12:01.168 --> 00:12:11.895]  They said, These solar projects reflect exemplary cooperation between the BLM and other federal, state, and local agencies, enabling through environmental review and robust mitigation provisions.
[00:12:11.895 --> 00:12:17.979]  The mitigation provisions specifically mentioned the Bundy Ranch because he was the last rancher that they hadn't driven out of business.
[00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:23.041]  They use these code violations just as they use them in the cities.
[00:12:23.041 --> 00:12:38.026]  They create a code violation, they come after poor people who have homes in the area, they start multiplying fees against them until they can condemn the homes, knock the homes down, and of course they've passed laws that people cannot rebuild in that small of a lot.
[00:12:38.026 --> 00:12:39.746]  So they keep these properties.
[00:12:39.746 --> 00:12:41.587]  That's what I've seen happen in Tampa.
[00:12:41.587 --> 00:12:43.888]  That's what Alex Jones has seen happen in Austin.
[00:12:44.528 --> 00:12:52.012]  That's the way they pull people out of their homes and the same thing is going on only on a much, much larger scale.
[00:12:52.012 --> 00:12:56.075]  There were 53 ranchers that were there before they put them out of business.
[00:12:56.075 --> 00:13:07.462]  If you change the terms of the agreement that these people have held for generations and say you're only going to be able to have a business that is 10% the size it was before, they're going to drive most of those people out.
[00:13:07.462 --> 00:13:10.303]  They did it without using any kind of
[00:13:12.264 --> 00:13:18.206]  Eminent Domain, they did it just with regulation until their businesses were not really worth anything.
[00:13:18.206 --> 00:13:23.508]  A few people they bought out for pennies on the dollar, many of them died under the stress.
[00:13:23.508 --> 00:13:27.049]  You can't allow this to happen in this area.
[00:13:27.049 --> 00:13:29.490]  If you do, it's going to happen everywhere.
[00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.731]  But here's the other thing we saw, and this is one of the reasons we went out there.
[00:13:32.731 --> 00:13:38.953]  As Paul Joseph Watson reported a week ago, and this story went national when Drudge picked up his stories.
[00:13:40.034 --> 00:13:43.616]  We saw martial law being enacted in that area.
[00:13:43.616 --> 00:13:45.938]  We saw them moving against the family.
[00:13:45.938 --> 00:13:48.360]  Let me play for you the words of Ammon Bundy.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.503]  And this is what he said in the morning before anything happened with the sheriff.
[00:13:52.503 --> 00:13:55.064]  And this is before anything happened with the cattle.
[00:13:55.064 --> 00:14:00.468]  He was just recalling what it was like to see his area where he had lived under martial law.
[00:14:00.468 --> 00:14:01.569]  Let me play that for you right here.
[00:14:01.569 --> 00:14:07.933]  I looked up on those hills and they were completely occupied.
[00:14:07.933 --> 00:14:09.234]  And we were under martial law.
[00:14:10.222 --> 00:14:13.245]  By an unauthorized agency.
[00:14:13.245 --> 00:14:14.606]  And that's the way it was.
[00:14:14.606 --> 00:14:21.051]  If we stepped off the road, they would pounce off and shove our faces in the dirt.
[00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:25.615]  And to have that feeling, I've never had it before in this country.
[00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:29.898]  To have the feeling of freedom taken away from you.
[00:14:29.898 --> 00:14:34.162]  My friends, it is not a good feeling.
[00:14:34.162 --> 00:14:35.543]  It is not a good feeling.
[00:14:37.216 --> 00:14:44.298]  My family and the community has run these hills and enjoyed these hills for generations.
[00:14:44.298 --> 00:14:50.600]  Never once in the history of this nation have those mountains ever been restricted from us.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.860]  Never.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.481]  And yet this week, they were.
[00:14:55.481 --> 00:14:56.621]  So a battle began.
[00:15:00.007 --> 00:15:18.574]  A battle on the roadside where my brother was taken down by about 20 agencies and taken to a federal court or a federal jail and we had to battle for him and then they didn't even prosecute him just jumped dumped him out on the street once they knew that everybody's going to make a big enough stink.
[00:15:22.165 --> 00:15:23.607]  That's exactly what we're talking about.
[00:15:23.607 --> 00:15:24.528]  It's martial law.
[00:15:24.528 --> 00:15:25.370]  He called it martial law.
[00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.611]  It is martial law.
[00:15:26.611 --> 00:15:34.923]  If there is no free speech, this is a bureaucracy from Washington that went into this area and said, we're going to set up free speech areas where you can exercise your free speech.
[00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:38.972]  They set up snipers pointing them at these people.
[00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:43.974]  He said there was just only about three of us about a week ago and we were facing snipers on the hill.
[00:15:43.974 --> 00:15:46.454]  I couldn't believe that this would happen in our own area.
[00:15:46.454 --> 00:15:53.797]  Let me tell you something, if you're in denial about what happened to this family, you're going to see the same thing happen to you if you don't stand together.
[00:15:53.797 --> 00:16:00.019]  If they can come in and say you have no free speech, we're going to arrest you if you set foot on this property on the King's land,
[00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:13.867]  If they're going to set up observation posts looking at people, if they're going to rest and tase anybody that steps out of their car onto this, and we saw this happen over and over again, they're basically were acting as predators.
[00:16:13.867 --> 00:16:23.315]  And the videos that you've seen where they tasered the guy that was just speaking, that was Ammon Bundy, he was a son of Cliben Bundy, tasered him multiple times.
[00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.176]  Multiple times.
[00:16:24.176 --> 00:16:26.958]  These guys pulled them out and kept going.
[00:16:27.719 --> 00:16:29.019]  They didn't go after these guys.
[00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:39.603]  What they did was they came up in the crowd and attacked the smallest person there, a woman who was recovering from cancer, grabbed her from behind and threw her to the ground.
[00:16:39.603 --> 00:16:41.403]  They're ambush predators.
[00:16:41.403 --> 00:16:42.544]  They single out the weak.
[00:16:43.084 --> 00:16:45.046]  That's why we needed to stand with them.
[00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.167]  That's why we needed to have everybody standing up.
[00:16:47.167 --> 00:16:50.349]  And I was so heartened to see so many people show up.
[00:16:50.349 --> 00:16:57.615]  So many of them told us that they had heard about this story through InfoWars because it broke nationally when Drudge picked up Watson's story.
[00:16:59.079 --> 00:17:01.060]  And just the spirit of the people there.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:07.961]  We went to that area when they called for people to go to the area to pick up the cattle.
[00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:16.204]  It was great to see Clive and Bundy standing there listening to the sheriff saying that they were now going to give them back some of their rights.
[00:17:16.204 --> 00:17:20.125]  You know, they take a hundred steps forward and they take one step back.
[00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:24.586]  And he just listened to him silently and then he got up and he said, well I'm going to tell you now what we want.
[00:17:25.848 --> 00:17:36.616]  We want you, as the lawful authority here, the sheriff, to collect the weapons from this unlawful military band that's come here and deposit them here in one hour.
[00:17:36.616 --> 00:17:43.201]  And we want you to take down those barricades where they've been taxing people, where they've been attacking people.
[00:17:43.201 --> 00:17:46.504]  We want you to take those down in one hour.
[00:17:46.504 --> 00:17:48.806]  Now we waited, and of course they didn't do any of that.
[00:17:49.639 --> 00:17:53.780]  And then he got up to the microphone, he said, I don't give you orders.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:59.141]  I only give orders to two people, the governor and the sheriff, because they have a duty to fulfill.
[00:17:59.141 --> 00:18:00.782]  But he goes, I'm telling you what we're going to do.
[00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:02.682]  We're going to go get our cattle.
[00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:04.363]  And if you want to come with us, you can.
[00:18:04.363 --> 00:18:06.823]  And it was an amazing sight.
[00:18:06.823 --> 00:18:07.904]  Everybody got in their cars.
[00:18:07.904 --> 00:18:09.384]  We went down there.
[00:18:09.384 --> 00:18:13.685]  As we got to the area, they were telling us, leave the area.
[00:18:13.685 --> 00:18:14.705]  We have a court order.
[00:18:14.705 --> 00:18:15.946]  We will use lethal force.
[00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:16.566]  We will shoot.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.544]  We waited for the cavalry to get there, essentially.
[00:18:20.544 --> 00:18:23.928]  We stood there and waited as they were threatening us.
[00:18:23.928 --> 00:18:27.512]  And then gradually, as the cavalry got there, we gradually approached.
[00:18:27.512 --> 00:18:30.155]  And we walked them down like V from Vendetta.
[00:18:30.155 --> 00:18:33.940]  It was amazing to see the resolution of these people and the peacefulness of it.
[00:18:34.639 --> 00:18:35.380]  This is the thing.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:42.347]  I've seen people writing comments about how, as Christians, should we take up arms against our government?
[00:18:42.347 --> 00:18:45.390]  You know, they told us to obey legal authority.
[00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.071]  That's the question.
[00:18:46.071 --> 00:18:47.432]  What is legal authority?
[00:18:47.432 --> 00:18:49.595]  Can you determine what legitimate authority is?
[00:18:51.434 --> 00:18:59.199]  Many times, people have questioned whether or not they're doing the right thing, whether they had a right to do this or not.
[00:18:59.199 --> 00:19:00.219]  Let me tell you something.
[00:19:00.219 --> 00:19:12.607]  When the BLM, when the EPA, when the IRS, when OSHA and ATF can create their regulations without any input from us, that is regulation without representation.
[00:19:14.121 --> 00:19:26.373]  Take a look at a Federal Reserve note and how they used to teach, before they changed the Federal Reserve notes every few months, they used to teach people how to recognize counterfeit Federal Reserve notes by having them study the real thing.
[00:19:27.383 --> 00:19:30.546]  You know how to know whether or not a law is legitimate or not?
[00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:32.527]  You study the real thing.
[00:19:32.527 --> 00:19:34.609]  That's the Constitution.
[00:19:34.609 --> 00:19:36.791]  The Bundys knew the Constitution.
[00:19:36.791 --> 00:19:39.493]  Cliven Bundy taught his family the Constitution.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:40.294]  We're going to be right back.
[00:19:40.294 --> 00:19:43.777]  We've got a comment from the Bureau of Land Management.
[00:19:43.777 --> 00:19:47.440]  Finally, they responded to our questions about why they're doing this.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.481]  We're going to have that response right after the break.
[00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:49.882]  Stay tuned.
[00:20:00.785 --> 00:20:04.070]  So my elementary school-aged child is begging me for a cell phone.
[00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.372]  Please, Mom, please!
[00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:06.373]  All the kids have them!
[00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:15.988]  But I've seen the research, and it makes sense to me that any mobile device that operates using electromagnetic frequencies that close to me or my child's head needs to be blocked.

[00:23:56.396 --> 00:23:57.777]  That's unseennow.com.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.128]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride
[00:24:12.503 --> 00:24:14.164]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:14.164 --> 00:24:19.228]  I'm David Knight and I just got back from Nevada from the Bundy Ranch standoff.
[00:24:19.228 --> 00:24:21.310]  I was there, so was Josh Owens.
[00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.551]  He's going to be joining me at the top of the hour.
[00:24:23.551 --> 00:24:28.615]  We're going to be joined at the bottom of the next hour at 1230 Central Time with Alex Jones.
[00:24:28.615 --> 00:24:36.001]  We're going to talk about how important this event was, the many principles that were involved here, the victory that we saw here.
[00:24:36.001 --> 00:24:39.343]  They basically were stood down by a determined group.
[00:24:39.343 --> 00:24:41.545]  Let me read you the motto of the Texas Rangers.
[00:24:42.403 --> 00:24:47.264]  No man in the wrong can stand up against a fellow that's on the right and keeps on a coming.
[00:24:47.264 --> 00:24:49.285]  That's the story this weekend.
[00:24:49.285 --> 00:24:51.206]  That's what happened on Saturday.
[00:24:51.206 --> 00:24:56.207]  That's what's been happening with Cliven Bundy since 1993.
[00:24:56.207 --> 00:24:58.848]  He's been in the right and he's kept on a coming.
[00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.091]  Now they were teaming up against him with his family.
[00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:07.673]  They had brought 200 officers down there, is the count that I have seen.
[00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:08.854]  Certainly believe that.
[00:25:08.854 --> 00:25:12.475]  As they were leaving the area, we counted 82 vehicles leaving.
[00:25:12.475 --> 00:25:14.176]  A massive compound.
[00:25:14.176 --> 00:25:17.617]  Can you guys pull up for the people who are watching, pull up the picture.
[00:25:17.617 --> 00:25:22.119]  They had aerial pictures that they had taken of the BLM compound there.
[00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:23.200]  I guess it was Thursday.
[00:25:24.295 --> 00:25:27.578]  They finally got somebody who came down and volunteered with a plane.
[00:25:27.578 --> 00:25:29.500]  They were trying to find his cattle.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.141]  His cattle were scattered all over the place.
[00:25:31.141 --> 00:25:34.605]  They were trying to find them before the BLM did so they could round them up.
[00:25:34.605 --> 00:25:37.387]  They also took pictures of the compound.
[00:25:37.387 --> 00:25:39.609]  Click on one of those and you can get a large picture of that.
[00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:40.010]  There you go.
[00:25:41.064 --> 00:25:46.867]  A huge compound, a huge military operation mounted against these people.
[00:25:46.867 --> 00:25:51.350]  But what happened was, Mr. Bundy quietly stood on his rights.
[00:25:51.350 --> 00:26:05.979]  They were trying to run him off the land, just as they had 52 other ranchers, using code violations, created by the Bureau of Land Management, which doesn't have any authority to legally write the law.
[00:26:05.979 --> 00:26:09.141]  But we've allowed that to happen, and it's not just that agency.
[00:26:09.781 --> 00:26:12.623]  We see that happening with every bureaucracy.
[00:26:12.623 --> 00:26:24.211]  Every bureaucracy in Washington is writing their own laws, creating their own militarized police force that they will use as if it is undeclared martial law whenever they feel like they need to.
[00:26:24.211 --> 00:26:27.573]  That's part of the ammunition purchases that we've seen.
[00:26:27.573 --> 00:26:32.557]  We've seen all these agencies, even the Oceanic Agency, NOAA.
[00:26:33.197 --> 00:26:35.359]  Has got its own law enforcement agencies like that.
[00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:38.643]  The Department of Education and they have used them as SWAT teams.
[00:26:38.643 --> 00:26:42.407]  There was a case where they pulled a man and his family out of their home.
[00:26:43.655 --> 00:26:49.038]  And the dead of night with guns loaded to their heads because they were looking for the wife who was no longer even living with the family.
[00:26:49.038 --> 00:26:53.100]  She had left the family because she had some outstanding student loans.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:58.523]  So the Department of Education sent the Department of Education SWAT team to collect the loans.
[00:26:58.523 --> 00:27:08.728]  If you think this is just about some rich white rancher Mormon getting his cattle back and disobeying the law and not paying his grazing fees, you're not paying attention.
[00:27:09.568 --> 00:27:10.729]  Essentially none of that is true.
[00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:26.880]  There's a lot of really hateful rhetoric about dividing people into groups and we've got a quote from Clive and Bundy's brother who discusses that about how their tactics, just as we have pointed out, their tactics are always to divide and conquer the population.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.363]  I see our whole society being picked apart by
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.062]  By forcing us into little groups that won't stand together.
[00:27:35.062 --> 00:27:52.314]  We've got this group over here, and they're worthless, and this group over here, and they're this, and they're that, and this is that, and everybody's divided, and everybody has some kind of conflict that they can't stand up for the other one, and this divides our society from being able to stand here.
[00:27:52.314 --> 00:28:00.299]  And I've seen people from every walk of life standing here, and this has changed my life from Monday till today.
[00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.852]  Yeah, that was an amazing speech.
[00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:09.614]  Now, let me tell you what happened on Saturday.
[00:28:09.614 --> 00:28:18.681]  We had an interview scheduled at 8 o'clock in the morning with Mr. Bundy, and we went to the place where we had arranged for the interview.
[00:28:18.681 --> 00:28:21.184]  He wasn't there, so we went to find out what was going on at the ranch.
[00:28:21.906 --> 00:28:28.649]  And they told us that the whole family was meeting in prayer, that they had just heard that the sheriff was going to be there at 9 a.m.
[00:28:28.649 --> 00:28:30.090]  in the morning.
[00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:34.092]  And he wanted to meet privately with Mr. Bundy, but he wasn't going to meet with him privately.
[00:28:34.092 --> 00:28:37.714]  He said, if you got anything to say to me, you can say it to the people that are here.
[00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:41.593]  The sheriff wanted to meet with him behind closed doors.
[00:28:41.593 --> 00:28:47.478]  Overnight, they had decided that they were going to allow him to put his cattle back on the range.
[00:28:47.478 --> 00:28:57.105]  It was interesting, when we first got there, they had signs up at the entrance to the open range area, saying that there was a cattle guard crossing.
[00:28:57.105 --> 00:29:02.390]  And if you don't know what one of those are, it's basically a lot of metal bars that were put into the street.
[00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.192]  And the second day we got there, they had taken down those signs.
[00:29:06.892 --> 00:29:10.154]  And so we got out and we took a picture of that.
[00:29:10.154 --> 00:29:14.536]  Josh and I did a report on that, showing that those cattle guard signs were down.
[00:29:14.536 --> 00:29:25.603]  Showing that something that had been there for a very, very long time, and of course the family has been there for 140 years, the state of Nevada had put that cattle guard into the road.
[00:29:25.603 --> 00:29:29.325]  They had put those signs up and they were going to remove those rights.
[00:29:29.605 --> 00:29:31.046]  That was where things were on Friday.
[00:29:31.046 --> 00:29:37.689]  We're going to pick it up and tell you what changed on Friday and how the events came down on Saturday.
[00:29:37.689 --> 00:29:41.191]  But it was truly an amazing story how this turned around.
[00:29:41.191 --> 00:29:43.472]  We can stand them down peacefully.
[00:29:43.472 --> 00:29:46.533]  If we look them in the eye, they will blink.
[00:29:46.533 --> 00:29:49.135]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.135 --> 00:29:50.535]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.535 --> 00:29:53.077]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.077 --> 00:29:55.738]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:04.321]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:30:04.321 --> 00:30:08.703]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:30:08.703 --> 00:30:12.345]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:30:12.345 --> 00:30:15.386]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:30:15.386 --> 00:30:22.730]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.874]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:30:26.874 --> 00:30:31.299]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:37.265]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:30:37.265 --> 00:30:41.209]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:30:41.209 --> 00:30:43.952]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:30:43.952 --> 00:30:45.273]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:30:45.413 --> 00:30:46.795]  It's time to take action.
[00:30:46.795 --> 00:30:48.617]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:17.554]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:17.854 --> 00:32:22.737]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:22.737 --> 00:32:29.522]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:29.522 --> 00:32:36.607]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:36.687 --> 00:32:43.729]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:43.729 --> 00:32:48.210]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:57.892]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:32:57.892 --> 00:32:59.573]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:08.331 --> 00:33:10.031]  You got a business.
[00:33:10.031 --> 00:33:11.872]  You didn't build that.
[00:33:11.872 --> 00:33:21.013]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:33:21.013 --> 00:33:25.954]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:25.954 --> 00:33:28.835]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.835 --> 00:33:30.215]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.215 --> 00:33:35.036]  I'm David Knight and I've just gotten back from the Bundy Ranch standoff in Nevada.
[00:33:36.687 --> 00:33:41.549]  As we heard at that beginning of the break as we're coming back in, Obama saying, you got a business?
[00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:42.550]  You didn't build that.
[00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.830]  We built that.
[00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:48.232]  That's the attitude I have seen over and over again about this standoff.
[00:33:48.232 --> 00:33:51.434]  That the government owns this property.
[00:33:51.434 --> 00:33:52.874]  The government has rights.
[00:33:52.874 --> 00:33:56.716]  Everybody else just has privileges that are granted to them by the government.
[00:33:56.716 --> 00:33:59.217]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[00:33:59.217 --> 00:33:59.818]  We have
[00:34:00.743 --> 00:34:03.684]  Rights that are given to us by our Creator.
[00:34:03.684 --> 00:34:05.845]  The people who were there understood that.
[00:34:05.845 --> 00:34:08.646]  They were raised on the Constitution.
[00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:11.907]  They were raised on a strong faith in God.
[00:34:11.907 --> 00:34:13.808]  They were grounded people.
[00:34:13.808 --> 00:34:17.309]  They knew what was genuine and what was not.
[00:34:17.309 --> 00:34:20.951]  The same way as I mentioned earlier, how did you used to train people?
[00:34:20.951 --> 00:34:26.973]  When we had a cashless society, now we've gone pretty much to a cashless society, and we've had, say, the money changing all the time.
[00:34:26.973 --> 00:34:29.034]  But when they didn't change the money every few months,
[00:34:29.773 --> 00:34:39.605]  We had a long-standing Federal Reserve notes that people knew what they looked like and the way they trained bank tellers was to have them study the details of these notes.
[00:34:39.605 --> 00:34:42.549]  That's the way they would understand what a counterfeit looked like.
[00:34:42.549 --> 00:34:45.813]  They didn't look at all the different counterfeit reports from these various news media.
[00:34:46.494 --> 00:34:48.815]  We're here to tell you what happened there.
[00:34:48.815 --> 00:34:50.096]  I'm here to tell you what happened.
[00:34:50.096 --> 00:34:52.478]  Josh is going to be joining me at the top of the hour.
[00:34:52.478 --> 00:34:58.321]  Alex is going to be here to talk about how important this is in the broader scheme of things at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:34:58.321 --> 00:35:07.087]  And Jerome Corsi is going to be here in the third hour, and he's going to spread this out for us as far as the crony capitalism involving China.
[00:35:08.103 --> 00:35:12.665]  There were connections that we made here at Infowars.com, and I'm going to come back to that article.
[00:35:12.665 --> 00:35:17.326]  I was just starting to talk about the chronology about how things happened.
[00:35:17.326 --> 00:35:19.667]  As I mentioned, we were there on Friday.
[00:35:19.667 --> 00:35:23.969]  We were covering the standoff, the demonstrators.
[00:35:23.969 --> 00:35:25.089]  We'd had several interviews.
[00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:29.631]  You've probably seen those on the radio show here with Alex Jones, as well as the nightly news.
[00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:40.664]  We learned that there was going to be a demonstration at the sheriff's office because Mr. Bundy said the way for this to come down peacefully is for the sheriff or the governor to do their job.
[00:35:40.664 --> 00:35:45.972]  And it's very interesting, you know, Governor Sandoval had actually run against Harry Reid's son, Rory.
[00:35:47.134 --> 00:35:48.094]  As a Republican, he won.
[00:35:48.094 --> 00:35:51.678]  You know, Rory didn't want to put his last name on his signs, I was told.
[00:35:51.678 --> 00:36:04.629]  He just put the first name, Rory, trying to, I guess, hide his connection to Reid, because outside of Las Vegas and the people who run the voting machines, Harry Reid's not very popular, at least not in the areas of Nevada where we were.
[00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:19.420]  But anyway, Sandoval won, Sandoval is Republican, and he did put out a statement that said, no cow justifies the atmosphere of intimidation which currently exists, nor the limitation of constitutional rights that are sacred to all Nevadans.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:25.844]  He spoke out against these First Amendment zones, these First Amendment areas that the BLM created.
[00:36:25.844 --> 00:36:29.506]  And they did take those down, but he didn't do anything else.
[00:36:30.458 --> 00:36:32.339]  He didn't order anybody to do anything else.
[00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:34.700]  The sheriff was not doing anything else.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:40.924]  The sheriff was the legal, law-abiding authority in that area, not the BLM.
[00:36:40.924 --> 00:36:45.026]  And so a lot of people went down to protest the sheriff, to try to shame him into doing his job.
[00:36:45.026 --> 00:36:46.386]  And that was a very long drive.
[00:36:46.386 --> 00:36:47.647]  Clark County is huge.
[00:36:47.647 --> 00:36:52.670]  It's about an hour and a half drive from Bunkerville down to Las Vegas.
[00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.750]  A lot of people went down there.
[00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:54.851]  There was a demonstration.
[00:36:54.851 --> 00:36:58.613]  After that demonstration, you probably saw the video, we went in and tried to get some information from the
[00:36:59.778 --> 00:37:08.865]  The public information officer there at the Las Vegas Police Department and they essentially have combined the Metropolitan Police Force with the County Police Force.
[00:37:08.865 --> 00:37:12.528]  So that was where the Sheriff's Office was in Las Vegas.
[00:37:12.528 --> 00:37:18.052]  And he had authority all the way up to where Bunkerville was an hour and a half away in this gigantic county.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.342]  And of course, the public information officer would not answer any of our questions.
[00:37:23.342 --> 00:37:30.645]  I was amazed that he didn't even have a printed propaganda statement to talk about the ranch situation.
[00:37:30.645 --> 00:37:33.407]  He just said, that's the ranch, you know, I'm not going to talk about that.
[00:37:33.407 --> 00:37:35.007]  I don't even have a statement about that.
[00:37:35.007 --> 00:37:38.289]  You know, I didn't really go there thinking I was going to get any information from him.
[00:37:39.341 --> 00:37:56.975]  I was going there to give him some information, to tell him that we knew about Harry Reid's unethical connections to this Chinese energy company, and we knew what they were doing, not just with the Chinese energy company, but with First Solar, which has already broken ground.
[00:37:56.975 --> 00:37:59.977]  They're using the Bundy Ranch, and they had mentioned the Bundy Ranch.
[00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:02.759]  That was what broke on the story on Friday.
[00:38:02.759 --> 00:38:05.721]  And I was going there to give him that information, to get his response.
[00:38:05.721 --> 00:38:07.483]  Of course, he would not respond to anything.
[00:38:07.483 --> 00:38:08.524]  To respond to the fact
[00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:18.652]  That we had found documents that had them talking about how they had to remove the Bundy family and their quote-unquote trespass cattle from that area.
[00:38:18.652 --> 00:38:27.780]  In other words, abrogate their rights before they could then get full rights to the surface as well as the mineral rights to that area.
[00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:35.035]  And that area is not necessarily where they're going to be building any of these solar projects.
[00:38:35.035 --> 00:38:40.200]  Those solar projects were further south, but the Bundy Ranch was the mitigation area.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.523]  Think about carbon tax credit, carbon credits that they put up.
[00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:48.517]  This was so that they could essentially tell people who were concerned.
[00:38:48.517 --> 00:38:51.478]  They were using the environment as a pretense to do this.
[00:38:51.478 --> 00:39:03.063]  So they wanted to tell people that even though they were going to mine in the other area, or even though they were going to put up these massive construction projects, they were going to make the area where the Bundy family was even more pristine.
[00:39:03.063 --> 00:39:06.364]  So it was very important to them to keep their narrative going.
[00:39:06.364 --> 00:39:12.186]  Of course, they're not really too concerned about the turtles, and we found out about that.
[00:39:13.666 --> 00:39:20.370]  We went there to give the information to the public information officer, but they don't have even a prepared statement.
[00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:25.134]  Now on our way back, we stopped at 530 Pacific Time.
[00:39:25.134 --> 00:39:27.995]  We stopped for a teleconference from the BLM.
[00:39:27.995 --> 00:39:35.560]  They have essentially a propaganda statement at the beginning of it, and then they took questions from the press over the phone.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.803]  They didn't have any physical area where we could go and actually ask them questions.
[00:39:39.803 --> 00:39:39.943]  And I
[00:39:41.354 --> 00:39:50.638]  Read them the, essentially the essence of the story about the solar power crony capitalism that was going on with Harry Reid, ENN.
[00:39:50.638 --> 00:39:57.461]  Asked them to comment on that because we wanted them to know that we understood that this was about removing the Bundy family from that area.
[00:39:58.241 --> 00:40:08.949]  So that they would no longer have anyone with any property rights in that area, so that they could use that area as essentially an environmental credit for what they wanted to do with these solar projects.
[00:40:08.949 --> 00:40:10.250]  And of course they didn't comment on that.
[00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.412]  But again, it was a rhetorical question.
[00:40:13.412 --> 00:40:17.075]  We were giving them the information, telling them what we had discovered.
[00:40:18.206 --> 00:40:24.370]  Now as we got back to the area, and as I reported earlier in the day, they had removed the signs for the cattle guard crossings.
[00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:31.815]  They had cattle guards at the entrance to this, and they were embedded into the road so the cattle would not cross that.
[00:40:31.815 --> 00:40:33.696]  They had signs warning vehicles about that.
[00:40:33.696 --> 00:40:35.097]  Those were removed.
[00:40:35.097 --> 00:40:38.379]  They did not remove the open range sign that was right across from the demonstrators.
[00:40:38.379 --> 00:40:39.720]  They knew better than to try to do that.
[00:40:41.206 --> 00:40:46.089]  But the next morning, they had, overnight, rethought this.
[00:40:46.089 --> 00:40:47.729]  They saw the people gathering.
[00:40:47.729 --> 00:40:50.491]  They saw how viral this was becoming.
[00:40:50.491 --> 00:40:52.052]  They were very concerned.
[00:40:52.052 --> 00:40:56.634]  The government decided that they were going to try a, essentially a feint.
[00:40:56.634 --> 00:40:58.075]  See if they would accept this.
[00:40:58.075 --> 00:40:59.856]  So the sheriff came up that morning.
[00:41:00.476 --> 00:41:03.417]  And as I said before, we had an interview scheduled for him at 8 o'clock.
[00:41:03.417 --> 00:41:05.618]  They were in prayer about this 9 o'clock meeting.
[00:41:05.618 --> 00:41:10.660]  Mr. Bundy did not want to meet with him in a closed room.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.681]  He said, we're going to do this in public.
[00:41:12.681 --> 00:41:20.825]  And it was amazing to see the sheriff show up with trembling hands, reading the Bureau of Land Management press release.
[00:41:20.825 --> 00:41:28.568]  And the interesting thing was, is that overnight, they had put back those cattle crossing, cattle guard signs.
[00:41:30.256 --> 00:41:38.587]  They had, over the middle of the night, they had put the signs back, they had written the press release, and he came back and said, we're going to allow you to put your cattle on.
[00:41:38.587 --> 00:41:41.631]  Well, of course they had captured a lot of his cattle.
[00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:43.334]  At that point, Mr. Bundy said...
[00:41:44.417 --> 00:41:51.041]  What we want you to do is to take the weapons of these people who have turned this into martial law.
[00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:52.902]  That was essentially paraphrasing what he had to say.
[00:41:52.902 --> 00:41:58.326]  Then he said, we want you to take down these checkpoints that they have used to attack and to taser people.
[00:41:58.326 --> 00:42:04.070]  You know, when we had this teleconference, it was amazing to hear the national media and the inane
[00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.050]  Questions that they had.
[00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.891]  Just things like, where are you keeping the cattle?
[00:42:08.891 --> 00:42:10.112]  You know, that type of thing.
[00:42:10.112 --> 00:42:23.757]  It was the local media that was asking them things like, you've responded to the video that we saw where people were tasered, where they had dogs put on them, but you have not responded to the woman who was attacked and thrown to the ground from behind by your agents.
[00:42:24.497 --> 00:42:26.258]  No comment from the BLM.
[00:42:26.258 --> 00:42:29.461]  But we did have this comment that we got from them finally.
[00:42:29.461 --> 00:42:34.404]  We had asked them so many times, why are you turning this area into martial law?
[00:42:34.404 --> 00:42:35.385]  And here's what they had to say.
[00:42:35.385 --> 00:42:38.587]  I like turtles.
[00:42:38.587 --> 00:42:40.568]  Alright, you're a great zombie.
[00:42:40.568 --> 00:42:42.570]  Now that's right, they like turtles.
[00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:49.995]  They like turtles so much that they're killing 1,400 of them because they said they don't have enough money to feed them.
[00:42:50.788 --> 00:42:56.093]  And yet they mount a multi-million dollar militarized operation against this family.
[00:42:56.093 --> 00:42:58.516]  They had brand new trucks that they were driving down there.
[00:42:58.516 --> 00:43:06.684]  Of course, you could always tell if you saw people carrying guns, it's like, well, is this somebody that's there to support the Bundys or is this somebody that is there with the government?
[00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:09.767]  Well, if they had a brand spanking new car, they were from the government.
[00:43:10.796 --> 00:43:18.221]  But they could spend millions of dollars to support this operation, but they didn't have the money to feed the turtles.
[00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:27.308]  And of course, at the same time, they're being sued by environmentalists in California because the BLM hasn't even filed reports for seven years about this tortoise.
[00:43:28.308 --> 00:43:35.997]  Now the idiocy of this is that you've got an area that has 600,000 square miles and they've got only now about 900 cattle.
[00:43:35.997 --> 00:43:41.182]  As Mr. Bundy pointed out, they used to have 53 ranches, each of them with cattle.
[00:43:41.182 --> 00:43:44.466]  There used to be sheep ranchers there with thousands of sheep on the hill.
[00:43:44.466 --> 00:43:47.910]  And there were more desert turtles then than there are now.
[00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:49.291]  Clearly, that is not the case.
[00:43:49.952 --> 00:43:55.896]  We had a long interview that I conducted with a man named Mr. Pappas who had been there throughout this time.
[00:43:55.896 --> 00:43:57.537]  He even had a small turtle shell.
[00:43:57.537 --> 00:44:03.100]  He said they had bags of these baby turtle shells that had basically been picked at from the top.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:09.824]  He said it was ravens and birds that were not native to the area that had come in and that were taking these small turtles out of their nests.
[00:44:09.824 --> 00:44:11.765]  He believed that that was what was going on.
[00:44:11.765 --> 00:44:14.106]  It clearly wasn't the ranchers.
[00:44:14.106 --> 00:44:16.308]  The decline in turtle population happened
[00:44:17.282 --> 00:44:21.146]  At the time that they were declining the population of these cattle.
[00:44:23.379 --> 00:44:25.982]  And clearly it hasn't come back at all in 20 years.
[00:44:25.982 --> 00:44:27.683]  So there's something else going on.
[00:44:27.683 --> 00:44:29.145]  As Stefan Molyneux pointed out.
[00:44:29.145 --> 00:44:30.326]  I don't know if we've got that clip or not.
[00:44:30.326 --> 00:44:35.331]  It's important to remember that the federal government is very concerned about the tortoises.
[00:44:35.331 --> 00:44:42.999]  And one of the ways they've expressed that concern over the past few decades is exploding hundreds of nuclear weapons over Nevada and the Nevada desert.
[00:44:42.999 --> 00:44:46.802]  Because as we all know, if you have a tortoise shell, you're fine.
[00:44:47.503 --> 00:44:50.848]  Right, so I mean this is what they give people in nuclear attacks, a tortoise shell.
[00:44:50.848 --> 00:45:04.046]  So they've literally incinerated hundreds of thousands of these tortoises, but now this guy's 150 head of cattle that they want to let on this land, they fear, the cover story is that they might interfere with some tortoise habitats.
[00:45:04.446 --> 00:45:05.787]  It's all complete nonsense, of course.
[00:45:05.787 --> 00:45:07.327]  It's a mere exercise of power.
[00:45:07.327 --> 00:45:11.989]  I've heard some rumors that it's about oil rights, or fracking, or solar panels, and who knows?
[00:45:11.989 --> 00:45:13.710]  Maybe that's true, maybe that's not.
[00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:19.733]  But this is a mere exercise of power to destroy one of the last ranchers around.
[00:45:19.733 --> 00:45:22.274]  He said originally there were like 52, 53 other ranchers.
[00:45:22.274 --> 00:45:25.475]  They've all been run off the land with these excessive grazing fees.
[00:45:25.475 --> 00:45:27.356]  And then people say, well, why is food so expensive?
[00:45:27.356 --> 00:45:33.779]  Well, because you've got these ridiculous grazing fees from a government that has done nothing, nothing whatsoever to actually own this land.
[00:45:34.099 --> 00:45:38.142]  You know, you and I want to own something, we don't just get to sit there and say, mine!
[00:45:38.142 --> 00:45:38.362]  Right?
[00:45:38.362 --> 00:45:42.365]  You actually have to go earn the damn thing, or build it, or make it, or enclose it, or put something on it.
[00:45:42.365 --> 00:45:42.786]  Exactly right.
[00:45:42.786 --> 00:45:46.889]  And that also brings up the question as to what is legitimate law?
[00:45:46.889 --> 00:45:48.810]  Now here's a comment that my wife sent to me.
[00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.211]  The guy says, really?
[00:45:50.211 --> 00:45:52.913]  You're happy that a lawbreaker got away with breaking the law?
[00:45:52.913 --> 00:45:55.495]  Law is law, and Bundy broke the law.
[00:45:55.495 --> 00:45:58.478]  If Bundy did in fact break the law and is wrong here, he has to be held responsible.
[00:45:58.478 --> 00:46:02.401]  Well, the question is, how do we get legitimate law?
[00:46:02.401 --> 00:46:03.642]  What is legitimate law?
[00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:11.172]  Now of course, the legitimate law, the law that all the laws are subject to, is the Constitution.
[00:46:11.172 --> 00:46:12.493]  That is the ultimate law.
[00:46:12.493 --> 00:46:16.755]  That is what law enforcement and the military swear allegiance to.
[00:46:16.755 --> 00:46:22.837]  When they break their oath to that ultimate law, when the legislators break their oath to that ultimate law,
[00:46:23.297 --> 00:46:25.759]  They no longer have any authority.
[00:46:25.759 --> 00:46:42.774]  So there is a legitimate path of authority, but we also have some moral ethics here, and Christians should understand this, that if we're going to stand by, and they're showing up here on the screen, Dr. Martin Luther King says, never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal.
[00:46:43.715 --> 00:46:49.199]  Are we going to say that because it was a law Rosa Parks needed to stay at the back of the bus?
[00:46:49.199 --> 00:46:51.762]  There are higher moral laws.
[00:46:51.762 --> 00:46:54.083]  That's what Christians need to understand.
[00:46:54.083 --> 00:46:56.766]  We have people like Dietrich Bonhoeffer who stood against Hitler.
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:01.062]  We had Martin Luther King who stood against unjust laws.
[00:47:01.062 --> 00:47:09.367]  The laws need to be altered or abolished if they destroy people's rights, if they're immoral, if they're wrong.
[00:47:09.367 --> 00:47:12.469]  The Declaration of Independence says we have certain inalienable rights.
[00:47:12.469 --> 00:47:18.373]  We create governments to protect those rights when the governments destroy those rights.
[00:47:18.373 --> 00:47:23.716]  We, the people, have the right and the duty to alter or abolish that government.
[00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:34.555]  Now I want to play, have you guys got the clip from Steve Bundy, the one where he's talking about the court case.
[00:47:34.555 --> 00:47:40.898]  There was a court case when this all started, and understand that they've enjoyed surface rights, grazing rights for 140 years.
[00:47:43.379 --> 00:47:44.040]  I don't know.
[00:48:03.454 --> 00:48:13.559]  The number of cattle that you can have by 90% and we're going to not allow you to go out in the three months that are the best months to graze, the calving months that you need to be on the land.
[00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:15.040]  We're not going to allow you to do that.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:23.224]  They were essentially putting these people out of business with the code, the new code rules that they had enacted in order to protect the desert tortoise.
[00:48:23.224 --> 00:48:26.826]  So the ranchers got together, hired a lawyer, hired scientists, went to court.
[00:48:27.677 --> 00:48:32.140]  Because you know you should have your day in court before they confiscate your property.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.461]  That's what they were essentially doing.
[00:48:34.461 --> 00:48:36.002]  They were winning the argument.
[00:48:36.002 --> 00:48:40.505]  This was in 1993 with their lawyer, with the scientists that they had.
[00:48:40.505 --> 00:48:49.711]  They were opposed by the BLM, by the EPA, by environmental groups who were standing up and every time they brought something up there was opposition.
[00:48:49.711 --> 00:48:51.653]  Clearly they were losing the case.
[00:48:51.653 --> 00:48:54.414]  The judge was ruling in their favor over again.
[00:48:55.595 --> 00:49:00.497]  At one point, the BLM got up and said, you have no jurisdiction here, and just walked out.
[00:49:00.497 --> 00:49:03.178]  They realized they were losing the case, and they just walked out.
[00:49:03.178 --> 00:49:15.843]  Let's play that from... And during this whole case, the BLM's lawyers, the state of Nevada's lawyers, the conservation group, we had all the greenies there.
[00:49:15.843 --> 00:49:19.225]  Every one of their lawyers got up to speak every time anything was said.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:29.305]  And after they had lost the case, obviously they stood up and the only thing they had to say was, you have no jurisdiction over EPA law.
[00:49:31.194 --> 00:49:36.598]  And there were no rights to oppose the EPA in any regulation.
[00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:39.501]  You have no federal recourse in the law.
[00:49:39.501 --> 00:49:45.005]  And he had this situation where he's already paid for the grazing out here.
[00:49:45.005 --> 00:49:47.807]  This fee that they're charging him is just an arbitrary fee.
[00:49:47.807 --> 00:49:51.890]  They say, well, you can put that many cows out there and it's going to cost you this much.
[00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:55.153]  And next week it's something else.
[00:49:55.153 --> 00:49:58.275]  And then next week it was, well, you could have put out 150 cows.
[00:49:58.275 --> 00:49:59.076]  Now you can put out 50.
[00:50:00.905 --> 00:50:08.868]  And you can either comply and go out of business as they've done to all of the ranchers around, all of the people on the land.
[00:50:08.868 --> 00:50:12.730]  They want to completely be able to control what's in regulation.
[00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:17.872]  I don't know that that's their plan, but that's what's happened to our country.
[00:50:17.872 --> 00:50:22.814]  And one at a time, they can take out anyone in this country that opposes them.
[00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:24.099]  That's right.
[00:50:24.099 --> 00:50:25.440]  That's exactly what it's about.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.961]  It's a gradual infringement process.
[00:50:27.961 --> 00:50:34.184]  It's about regulations created by bureaucracies that are unaccountable to us, unanswerable to us.
[00:50:34.184 --> 00:50:36.025]  They are not on the ballot.
[00:50:36.025 --> 00:50:38.547]  We have regulation without representation.
[00:50:38.547 --> 00:50:42.349]  We have bureaucracies with armies to come out and enforce that.
[00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:44.650]  We have courts where we have no presumption of innocence.
[00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:46.332]  We're going to be right back.
[00:50:46.332 --> 00:50:47.375]  That is the key.
[00:50:47.375 --> 00:50:50.201]  That is happening to every business across the country.
[00:50:50.201 --> 00:50:54.570]  He's in a timeshare business, and they're putting them out of business with regulations.
[00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:55.272]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.272 --> 00:50:55.552]  Stay tuned.
[00:51:00.166 --> 00:51:02.868]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[00:52:58.755 --> 00:53:01.598]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:53:01.598 --> 00:53:06.722]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:53:06.722 --> 00:53:14.850]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:19.374]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:53:19.374 --> 00:53:23.177]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:53:23.337 --> 00:53:29.280]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.442]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:37.825]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:53:37.825 --> 00:53:45.850]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:53:49.352 --> 00:53:49.753]  Federal agents!
[00:53:49.753 --> 00:53:50.254]  We are armed!
[00:54:04.063 --> 00:54:15.053]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:15.053 --> 00:54:18.736]  I'm David Knight and we've been talking about the Bundy Ranch standoff.
[00:54:18.736 --> 00:54:23.140]  Josh Owens and I just got back and it was an amazing victory.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:28.824]  A victory for people who stood up against the gradual infringement of their rights and
[00:54:29.685 --> 00:54:35.110]  Really questioned, do they have the authority to put people off of their property?
[00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:39.194]  Got together, looked them in the eye, and the feds moved down.
[00:54:39.194 --> 00:54:40.436]  And Alex Jones is right here.
[00:54:40.436 --> 00:54:41.697]  That was an amazing victory, Alex.
[00:54:42.287 --> 00:54:46.128]  It was incredible, and I'm as proud of this as anything we've ever done.
[00:54:46.128 --> 00:54:51.791]  Yesterday, covering this on the Sunday show, and then of course Saturday watching them live, you stream.
[00:54:51.791 --> 00:55:01.034]  It was so historic, and I realized that when Bundy told a thousand people, we're going to walk through, we're going to march through, that this could have easily turned into Lexington or Concord.
[00:55:01.034 --> 00:55:01.754]  Yes.
[00:55:01.754 --> 00:55:02.855]  The shot heard around the world.
[00:55:03.815 --> 00:55:09.919]  There's a video at the bottom of Jerome Corsi's article on WorldNetDaily that I wanted to play that I think I sent you.
[00:55:09.919 --> 00:55:11.079]  Yes.
[00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:16.342]  Where a rancher a few days before gives a speech and he says, listen, I'm not going with guns.
[00:55:16.342 --> 00:55:18.944]  If they're going to shoot me, that'll be the shot heard around the world.
[00:55:18.944 --> 00:55:20.845]  They fire that, we'll fire the rest.
[00:55:21.405 --> 00:55:25.307]  And the Feds realized they didn't have the moral high ground.
[00:55:25.307 --> 00:55:31.171]  This event that happened is literally, and I'm going to talk about this at the bottom of the next hour after Josh comes in, is a Rosetta Stone.
[00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:38.216]  For those that don't know what the Rosetta Stone is, it was discovered and it was basically the way to decode these hieroglyphs that they could never understand before.
[00:55:39.156 --> 00:55:41.158]  And this is a Rosetta Stone.
[00:55:41.158 --> 00:55:46.344]  This is exactly what's happened in the Texas Revolution, in the 1776 Revolution.
[00:55:46.344 --> 00:55:51.650]  This is the kind of stuff that led to brush fire rebellions, that led to Magna Carta 1215.
[00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:55.694]  This is the kind of stuff that led the Israelites out of Egypt with Moses.
[00:55:55.694 --> 00:55:56.255]  Same story.
[00:55:56.255 --> 00:55:59.438]  I mean, this is the human story.
[00:55:59.438 --> 00:56:00.599]  It transcends America.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.322]  And the victory is the imagery.
[00:56:04.322 --> 00:56:06.583]  You couldn't ask for better propaganda for freedom.
[00:56:06.583 --> 00:56:07.884]  And propaganda doesn't mean lies.
[00:56:07.884 --> 00:56:09.645]  It's just gotten a bad connotation.
[00:56:09.645 --> 00:56:30.319]  It's truthful info war of good-looking, you know, hard-working farmers and folks coming together, real militia with their guns, with the guns at their side, marching towards men saying, we're going to shoot you, with their police dogs and all the rest of it, knowing they were in the wrong, standing down, the BLM deciding to be good, like the troops in V for Vendetta.
[00:56:30.839 --> 00:56:31.439]  Yes.
[00:56:31.439 --> 00:56:34.021]  Not shooting when the people peacefully walk towards them.
[00:56:34.021 --> 00:56:37.583]  And that eventually, that essentially happened in East Germany as well.
[00:56:37.583 --> 00:56:48.568]  At one point when the people got together in churches, exactly, they got together in the churches, they marched to the fences and the border guards had been shooting people trying to get over the fences in East Germany, stood down and refused the orders to shoot.
[00:56:48.568 --> 00:56:49.729]  And the whole government collapsed.
[00:56:49.729 --> 00:56:51.670]  The whole criminal illegitimate regime collapsed.
[00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:53.511]  And we want the Republic back.
[00:56:53.511 --> 00:56:55.492]  We want the New World Order system to collapse.
[00:56:56.412 --> 00:57:11.726]  And again, for those that don't know BLM, that don't know range rights, if you come in and you're a rancher and you want to buy grazing rights and no one has a claim and they have a clear claim, that's why BLM tried to buy it from him, then they can sell those rights if they're the manager and the steward.
[00:57:11.726 --> 00:57:13.427]  They were not the manager and the steward.
[00:57:13.427 --> 00:57:19.393]  Their family, as the antecedent I guess would be the term, are the progenitors of that, the first claim.
[00:57:19.393 --> 00:57:21.815]  It's 100% in common law, in state law.
[00:57:21.815 --> 00:57:22.936]  That's why Bundy's so mad.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.162]  And then you see the ignorant public going, that guy's not paying taxes for that!
[00:57:28.162 --> 00:57:34.626]  He paid taxes seven generations in blood, putting in the water tanks, putting in his ancestors.
[00:57:34.626 --> 00:57:36.607]  That's the essence of owning property.
[00:57:36.607 --> 00:57:39.088]  None of us own our houses anymore with property tax.
[00:57:39.088 --> 00:57:39.468]  That's right.
[00:57:39.468 --> 00:57:43.770]  The Rockefellers all get waivers and are exempt, if folks look it up.
[00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:47.112]  You pay a tax to have your car registered.
[00:57:47.112 --> 00:57:49.613]  Now they're raising that, putting people out of their cars.
[00:57:49.613 --> 00:57:50.234]  You pay a tax
[00:57:52.545 --> 00:57:53.506]  on your home.
[00:57:53.506 --> 00:57:55.208]  Most people I know can't pay their property taxes.
[00:57:55.208 --> 00:57:57.311]  They're taking old people's houses because they can't pay it.
[00:57:57.311 --> 00:57:58.793]  You don't really own your house.
[00:57:58.793 --> 00:58:00.876]  This is what feudalism is.
[00:58:00.876 --> 00:58:03.500]  And so the next 30 minutes she'll break this down.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.042]  Josh Owens was a real hero.
[00:58:05.042 --> 00:58:06.444]  Everybody that was there was a hero.
[00:58:06.444 --> 00:58:07.365]  To march towards
[00:58:08.166 --> 00:58:14.935]  People pointing guns at you, saying we will shoot, who had just attacked dogs and tasered people and thrown women to the ground.
[00:58:14.935 --> 00:58:15.936]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:58:15.936 --> 00:58:22.084]  You guys, like V for Vendetta, that's a movie, this is real, walked into this and they said, no, we're not letting the cattle go, get out of here.
[00:58:22.084 --> 00:58:23.125]  And we said, all right, we're coming through.
[00:58:23.886 --> 00:58:27.349]  And so you guys tore the gates down and marched over.
[00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:28.069]  We're going to break.
[00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.650]  We're coming back.
[00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:31.052]  I'll break it all down at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:58:31.052 --> 00:58:31.973]  This is historic.
[00:58:31.973 --> 00:58:33.594]  This is All-American's victory.
[00:58:33.594 --> 00:58:35.796]  And we defeated the mainstream media and their fraud.
[00:58:35.796 --> 00:58:37.737]  We exposed Harry Reid.
[00:58:37.737 --> 00:58:38.638]  It's the key.
[00:58:38.638 --> 00:58:40.920]  We'll be back.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:44.523]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:57.544]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:58:57.544 --> 00:58:59.907]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:58:59.907 --> 00:59:05.252]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:05.252 --> 00:59:10.358]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:10.478 --> 00:59:13.879]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:13.879 --> 00:59:18.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.401]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:22.401 --> 00:59:32.743]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:32.743 --> 00:59:37.225]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:59:37.225 --> 00:59:38.985]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse
[00:59:38.985 --> 00:59:40.146]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:10.031]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.031 --> 01:00:11.613]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.613 --> 01:00:13.155]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:17.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.425]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.038 --> 01:00:24.519]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:24.519 --> 01:00:28.401]  I'm David Knight and I'm joined here in studio with Josh Owens.
[01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:31.602]  Josh and I just got back from the Bundy Ranch in Nevada.
[01:00:31.602 --> 01:00:34.164]  The showdown at Bunkerville.
[01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:37.305]  This was an amazing precedent.
[01:00:37.305 --> 01:00:39.806]  For so long, I've been following these stories.
[01:00:39.806 --> 01:00:41.267]  I've seen people brutalized.
[01:00:41.267 --> 01:00:43.628]  I've seen martial law enacted one place after the other.
[01:00:43.628 --> 01:00:44.269]  I've seen them...
[01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:55.555]  Incrementally taking people's rights away, whether it's their free speech rights, whether it's their 4th Amendment rights, their 6th Amendment rights, their 2nd Amendment rights, even their 1st Amendment rights.
[01:00:55.555 --> 01:00:59.597]  The government is taking all of our rights, taking our property rights.
[01:00:59.597 --> 01:01:01.278]  That was what was at stake here.
[01:01:01.278 --> 01:01:12.004]  This was much, much bigger than just one rancher and his grazing fees and the tortoises that they were using as a pretense to shut these ranchers down.
[01:01:12.904 --> 01:01:16.125]  Now we've got Josh Owens we're going to be talking to this half hour.
[01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:19.146]  At the bottom of the half hour Alex Jones is going to be joining us.
[01:01:19.146 --> 01:01:22.987]  And at the top of the next hour we're going to be joined with Jerome Corsi.
[01:01:22.987 --> 01:01:31.909]  And he's going to be talking about the massive crony capitalism that is actually motivating these corrupt politicians to do these types of things to people.
[01:01:32.603 --> 01:01:36.865]  And we're going to be talking about how it's not just here, but it's many, many other places.
[01:01:36.865 --> 01:01:41.187]  According to his research, and according to reports that we've had at Infowars here, he wrote a story.
[01:01:41.187 --> 01:01:55.555]  We wanted to get him on to talk about the extensive tentacles of the Chinese government, the deals that they're making with Obama to sell off the land, to give them title to the land, because they now essentially own America with this debt that they've bought up.
[01:01:55.555 --> 01:01:56.996]  So it's a big story.
[01:01:57.876 --> 01:02:00.778]  This is being used like carbon credits.
[01:02:00.778 --> 01:02:03.580]  The Bundy Ranch had two things going for it.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:06.162]  One of them was that they needed to get them out of there.
[01:02:06.162 --> 01:02:12.146]  One of them was that they needed it for essentially carbon credits for mitigation, as they call it.
[01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:25.496]  As they were going to develop these projects throughout the area, whether it's solar power projects or whether it is mining minerals or fracking or whatever, for all the things that they wanted to do to the land that the government claims ownership of,
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:35.208]  They wanted to have the Bundy area used as a mitigation area, as a place that was going to be extra pristine.
[01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:39.011]  The other part about it was that he had grazing and water rights.
[01:02:39.011 --> 01:02:48.861]  And if the federal government can come in and take his grazing and water rights that his family has had for generations, they can come in and take your rights at your suburban home.
[01:02:49.554 --> 01:02:55.762]  They've already done it with the property taxes that weren't in all 50 states the last 30 years.
[01:02:55.762 --> 01:02:56.142]  Yes.
[01:02:56.142 --> 01:02:57.664]  You do not own your house.
[01:02:57.664 --> 01:02:58.085]  That's right.
[01:02:58.085 --> 01:02:59.426]  And it's the same thing with this.
[01:02:59.426 --> 01:03:05.213]  Washington Times just came out and they basically have Harry Reid's people, it's up on drugsreport.com, admitting
[01:03:05.754 --> 01:03:10.576]  That it was the stories coming out about Reid connected to this is why the orders came down.
[01:03:10.576 --> 01:03:13.957]  And that's the liberals saying that because they're like, your guns didn't make us back down.
[01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:16.338]  Harry Reid told us to.
[01:03:16.338 --> 01:03:17.118]  Well, no kidding.
[01:03:17.118 --> 01:03:19.479]  That's why we did this so there wouldn't be bloodshed.
[01:03:19.479 --> 01:03:20.299]  That's right.
[01:03:20.299 --> 01:03:25.181]  On Friday, I was trying to figure out a way to try to not have a standoff and a bunch of killing.
[01:03:25.181 --> 01:03:27.042]  And I'm not taking credit.
[01:03:27.042 --> 01:03:29.023]  All I'm saying is we dug into Reid.
[01:03:29.023 --> 01:03:29.723]  He was involved.
[01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:30.823]  Drudge linked to it.
[01:03:30.823 --> 01:03:32.624]  It was the number one story Saturday on the Internet.
[01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:39.049]  Well, the story broke as we were talking in overdrive.
[01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:42.472]  And then we went down and gave the information to the Sheriff's Office.
[01:03:42.472 --> 01:03:45.535]  Then we called up the BLM on a teleconference and gave them the information.
[01:03:45.535 --> 01:03:47.296]  And then everything changed overnight.
[01:03:50.646 --> 01:03:51.326]  Wow.
[01:03:51.326 --> 01:03:56.450]  Anyways, you guys, get Josh's take on... I want to hear from Josh what it was like coming up in the next segment.
[01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:57.970]  You know, that's the key.
[01:03:57.970 --> 01:04:04.274]  What was it like being on the ground there, hearing the loudspeaker saying, you know, we will shoot when you march through there?
[01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:05.255]  Because that's the key.
[01:04:05.255 --> 01:04:07.116]  But I'll quit bugging you guys.
[01:04:07.116 --> 01:04:09.037]  It's just very, very exciting to see all this unfolding.
[01:04:11.032 --> 01:04:15.134]  So Josh, when we were there on Friday, they had already taken down the signs.
[01:04:15.134 --> 01:04:19.095]  They were not backing back, even on Friday, even as people were accumulating.
[01:04:19.095 --> 01:04:22.217]  We had just gone with the story that Kit Daniels wrote.
[01:04:22.217 --> 01:04:27.479]  We had just, Alex had covered it as we were talking to him live at the site.
[01:04:27.479 --> 01:04:28.619]  He covered it in overdrive.
[01:04:28.619 --> 01:04:32.301]  He was very excited about it and from there we went down to Nevada.
[01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:33.942]  And now we're out of time.
[01:04:33.942 --> 01:04:35.243]  I'm going to be right back with Josh.
[01:04:35.243 --> 01:04:37.325]  I was about to give him a chance to say something.
[01:04:37.325 --> 01:04:39.747]  He's going to break down for you what he saw.
[01:04:39.747 --> 01:04:41.168]  I've been talking about what I saw.
[01:04:41.168 --> 01:04:42.729]  We'll be right back with Josh.
[01:04:42.729 --> 01:04:44.991]  Alex is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:04:44.991 --> 01:04:49.275]  And Jerome, of course, is going to be talking to us about what the Chinese are doing all across the country.
[01:04:49.275 --> 01:04:52.198]  And by the way, you guys kind of look like Confederate generals together in here.
[01:04:52.198 --> 01:04:53.859]  I think that's racist.
[01:04:53.859 --> 01:04:54.560]  Cut the beards off.
[01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:08.653]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:05:08.653 --> 01:05:10.874]  All the major networks are state-run.
[01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:13.575]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:05:13.575 --> 01:05:17.937]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[01:05:17.937 --> 01:05:20.998]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:05:21.138 --> 01:05:28.627]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:05:28.627 --> 01:05:32.953]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:05:32.953 --> 01:05:34.755]  We are the true media.
[01:05:34.755 --> 01:05:37.358]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:05:37.418 --> 01:05:41.200]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[01:07:00.362 --> 01:07:03.785]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:07:03.785 --> 01:07:06.227]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:07:06.227 --> 01:07:14.814]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:07:14.814 --> 01:07:22.781]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[01:07:23.101 --> 01:07:31.133]  Super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.

[01:08:01.738 --> 01:08:07.143]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:07.143 --> 01:08:09.446]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:12.745 --> 01:08:14.166]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:14.846]  I'm David Knight.
[01:08:14.846 --> 01:08:17.447]  I'm joined in the studio with Josh Owens.
[01:08:17.447 --> 01:08:26.452]  The two of us have just returned from the Nevada, the Bunkerville, Nevada standoff between federal agents from the BLM and the Bundy family.
[01:08:26.452 --> 01:08:38.018]  Now, there's an interesting story that's just come up on the Washington Times, and they are saying that they left little doubt that there was a highly charged episode was threatening to become a political headache for the Nevada
[01:08:38.598 --> 01:08:39.538]  Democrat.
[01:08:39.538 --> 01:08:46.420]  They have a quote that says, based on information, well this is actually the statement that Corns put out.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:52.602]  They said it was likely pressure from upstairs rather than weapons from the field that changed his mind on the matter.
[01:08:52.602 --> 01:08:54.622]  This is Americans against the Tea Party.
[01:08:54.622 --> 01:08:56.463]  That's a liberal group that said that.
[01:08:56.463 --> 01:08:58.924]  So they believe that it was Harry Reid that made this stand out.
[01:08:58.924 --> 01:09:07.646]  Because the order, Josh, came from the guy who had been his senior policy advisor, who is now the director at the BLM, Neil Corns.
[01:09:08.406 --> 01:09:08.687]  And he's
[01:09:28.107 --> 01:09:31.910]  The resources in that area that the federal government is claiming ownership of.
[01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:33.752]  But we saw a dramatic turnaround.
[01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:40.137]  When we were there on Friday, and I want you to talk about this, when we were there on Friday, they had already taken down the cattle crossing guards.
[01:09:40.137 --> 01:09:46.061]  Even though there was a lot of national press, and even by Friday, CNN was there pushing back against what was really going on.
[01:09:46.061 --> 01:09:48.383]  They were trying to push the government's narrative.
[01:09:48.383 --> 01:09:52.266]  You had a lot of national press there by that time.
[01:09:52.266 --> 01:09:56.309]  In addition to us, they had put in Fox News and CNN had shown up.
[01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:59.691]  But they were moving forward with their agenda.
[01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:20.697]  And then as we were talking live to Alex here, Kit Daniels brought up the story, and again, it was something that was first reported on a couple of years ago, but what Kit Daniels found were the connections between these solar projects that they wanted to do and the Bundy Ranch being a mitigation area, where they were going to use it like carbon credits.
[01:10:20.697 --> 01:10:25.178]  And then we went down to Las Vegas to the Sheriff's Office to tell them what happened there.
[01:10:27.093 --> 01:10:32.038]  I'm sure people have seen the video and if not, you can look, you can see it, it's on the website, it's on YouTube.
[01:10:32.038 --> 01:10:35.361]  We walk in and ask a simple question and they were unprepared to answer a question.
[01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:36.742]  I mean, that was their job.
[01:10:36.742 --> 01:10:39.465]  It was their job to answer questions and they weren't prepared to do it.
[01:10:39.465 --> 01:10:42.547]  So they wanted to speak with us outside and they showed us the door.
[01:10:42.547 --> 01:10:46.171]  The amazing thing that really got me angry, we went down basically to give them information.
[01:10:46.171 --> 01:10:49.294]  We're going to ask a rhetorical question about this corruption and the links to it.
[01:10:49.674 --> 01:10:54.600]  And of course we knew that Sheriff Gillespie had deep, long ties with Harry Reid.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.824]  Anybody that's in high office there has ties to Harry Reid.
[01:10:57.824 --> 01:10:58.144]  Okay?
[01:10:58.144 --> 01:11:02.249]  And we wanted to talk to him about the fact that Harry Reid's son was a lobbyist.
[01:11:02.249 --> 01:11:06.814]  You know, we wanted to essentially present the facts to him that we had, that Kit Daniels had put into the story.
[01:11:07.535 --> 01:11:12.639]  He kind of cut us off and said if this is about the ranch we've got nothing to say and I said well then give me your press release.
[01:11:12.639 --> 01:11:14.800]  They didn't even have a press release.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.141]  But go ahead.
[01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:19.784]  At that point it got us really angry when he said let's talk about this outside.
[01:11:19.784 --> 01:11:21.405]  Yeah well and it should have.
[01:11:21.405 --> 01:11:22.266]  It should have.
[01:11:22.266 --> 01:11:33.414]  I think the biggest thing that people who weren't there, people who don't, something that people didn't realize is that it took a lot of courage for this family to stand up and keep saying no.
[01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:33.574]  Yes.
[01:11:33.974 --> 01:11:37.697]  No, we're not going to pay the fees to the federal government.
[01:11:37.697 --> 01:11:38.978]  And then they surround their house.
[01:11:38.978 --> 01:11:40.860]  And no, we're not going to stop.
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.662]  And then they come and they throw their sons on the ground.
[01:11:43.662 --> 01:11:45.063]  They arrest them.
[01:11:45.063 --> 01:11:46.184]  They tase them.
[01:11:46.184 --> 01:11:48.706]  They throw the woman with cancer.
[01:11:48.706 --> 01:11:51.168]  They sling her and slam her onto the ground.
[01:11:51.388 --> 01:11:53.049]  That was all like Monday and Tuesday.
[01:11:53.049 --> 01:11:55.009]  This was as the story was breaking nationally.
[01:11:55.009 --> 01:11:59.031]  You know, this has been going on, of course, for 20 years.
[01:11:59.031 --> 01:12:05.413]  But it's just now that they're coming in, and that's another thing that tells us something about that, and that's the timing.
[01:12:05.413 --> 01:12:20.359]  First, solar just broke ground with Harry Reid in another area, and they've got right there in Nevada, and they need this area to have their quote-unquote solar mitigation, to keep this pretense about protecting the tortoises there.
[01:12:21.161 --> 01:12:25.552]  As well as to get his, to take the last rancher standing to take his rights.
[01:12:25.552 --> 01:12:27.457]  That's what they've been doing all this time.
[01:12:27.457 --> 01:12:30.404]  It's that kind of incrementalism that they do against all of us.
[01:12:31.104 --> 01:12:31.544]  Yeah.
[01:12:31.544 --> 01:12:43.129]  Well, I think that bottom line, we see so many people who are ignorant and so many people who don't have that fight, aren't willing to stand up because they believe that they don't have power or a lot of them just don't care.
[01:12:43.129 --> 01:12:52.073]  But then when you go and you see these kind of people are willing to stand up and they're willing to, I mean, they were not going to back down and they're still not going to back down.
[01:12:52.073 --> 01:12:54.754]  They've come out and they've said, yeah, we know that the war isn't over.
[01:12:54.754 --> 01:12:55.134]  That's right.
[01:12:55.134 --> 01:12:56.134]  The war isn't over.
[01:12:56.134 --> 01:12:56.855]  It was a battle.
[01:12:56.855 --> 01:12:57.715]  We won this battle.
[01:12:57.715 --> 01:12:59.976]  And when they come again, we're going to do the same thing again.
[01:13:00.416 --> 01:13:02.257]  That's the thing that I'm concerned about.
[01:13:02.257 --> 01:13:04.738]  I see a lot of people pushing back and they say, you think this is over?
[01:13:04.738 --> 01:13:06.359]  Of course we don't think it's over.
[01:13:06.359 --> 01:13:07.460]  We know it's not over.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.441]  They know it's not over.
[01:13:09.441 --> 01:13:11.222]  The battle for America is not over.
[01:13:11.222 --> 01:13:24.309]  We still have a system here where we've got many, many government agencies, a whole alphabet soup of government agencies who are writing their own laws, who have their own militarized police force, who have their own courts.
[01:13:24.309 --> 01:13:25.930]  You have no presumption of innocence.
[01:13:26.977 --> 01:13:28.218]  This is the problem.
[01:13:28.218 --> 01:13:34.582]  It's not just the people who, this is an Agenda 21 portion, but they've got so many different areas where they're doing the same thing.
[01:13:34.582 --> 01:13:36.223]  Just look at the income taxes.
[01:13:36.223 --> 01:13:36.983]  Tomorrow's April 15th.
[01:13:38.123 --> 01:13:46.890]  Okay, look at how just this last week they broke a story that the IRS is going to go back and tax people for tax debts that their parents had.
[01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:53.235]  So they've always come after spouses for debts that their spouses have had, even if, you know, people are separated.
[01:13:53.235 --> 01:13:57.918]  Now they're going to come after you for things that they presume that your parents had.
[01:13:57.918 --> 01:14:02.702]  And that's the kind of thing we see, that kind of encroachment that we see going on and on.
[01:14:02.702 --> 01:14:03.363]  How do we stop that?
[01:14:04.175 --> 01:14:33.036]  Well I think we stop it just like these people stopped the federal government from coming in and taking their land up until now and obviously it's not over but we don't I mean these people could have started that they could have started paying their grazing fees they could have said well you know it's not you know it's not worth our time it's not worth our energy because obviously it would have been easier for them not in the long run because they're going to incrementally keep taking everything and everything and I think there's nothing left and I understood that yeah and but this family could have just said well we'll pay our fees and then we'll be able you know I mean
[01:14:34.244 --> 01:14:35.505]  We'll be able to have our time.
[01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:38.607]  We'll be able to sit inside and we'll be able to relax.
[01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.308]  And that wasn't the case.
[01:14:40.308 --> 01:14:44.371]  I mean, if you saw this family, they were exhausted.
[01:14:44.371 --> 01:14:53.316]  I mean, they were to the point where, I mean, of course, I'm sure that they're tired of this going on, but they're not going to stop and they're not going to stand down.
[01:14:53.316 --> 01:14:58.220]  And we saw that when the sheriff came and when the sheriff finally broke his silence, that Cliven
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:02.842]  You know, everyone was cheering, you know, yeah, the BLM's leaving, but he said, no, that's not it.
[01:15:02.842 --> 01:15:03.982]  That's not all we want.
[01:15:03.982 --> 01:15:05.423]  Disarm the Park Service.
[01:15:05.423 --> 01:15:05.923]  Yes.
[01:15:05.923 --> 01:15:09.965]  Tear down these buildings where you're forcing us to pay to go on our own land.
[01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:16.407]  And the sheriff was standing there shaking and he was scared because he saw someone that wasn't just saying, all right, you're giving us a little bit, now we're going to back off.
[01:15:16.407 --> 01:15:17.868]  And the sheriff never did his job.
[01:15:18.288 --> 01:15:18.508]  No.
[01:15:18.508 --> 01:15:21.170]  He never got rid of the BLM.
[01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:27.794]  He never protected the people who were being robbed by the federal government, who were being attacked by the federal government, who were having guns pointed at them.
[01:15:27.794 --> 01:15:31.396]  Look, folks, it's a serious thing when somebody puts a gun in your face.
[01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:31.496]  Yeah.
[01:15:31.496 --> 01:15:35.939]  And when you've got sniper nests pointed at you, that's a very serious thing.
[01:15:35.939 --> 01:15:43.024]  And they had already, as Josh pointed out, they'd tasered them, they'd stuck dogs on them, they had arrested them, taken them to the ground.
[01:15:43.024 --> 01:15:46.306]  Dave Bundy was arrested before the guys were tasered multiple times.
[01:15:46.946 --> 01:15:49.007]  These guys shook off the tasers.
[01:15:49.007 --> 01:15:50.107]  They kept coming.
[01:15:50.107 --> 01:15:58.790]  And just like we're talking about the motto of the Texas Rangers, you know, when the guy in the right keeps on coming, he's always going to take down the guy who is in the wrong.
[01:15:58.790 --> 01:16:00.070]  That's what we saw happening.
[01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:01.471]  Very meek person.
[01:16:01.471 --> 01:16:06.792]  Wouldn't you say they're kind of like Ron Paul, I said earlier, but a backbone of steel.
[01:16:06.792 --> 01:16:12.174]  And that was true of his sons as well, of Ammon and of Dave and of Ryan.
[01:16:12.174 --> 01:16:15.655]  These guys were the ones that were out front, that were standing up and talking to people
[01:16:16.135 --> 01:16:19.276]  When Ammon was back there, he was keeping everybody calm.
[01:16:19.276 --> 01:16:20.916]  He was saying, we don't need guns.
[01:16:20.916 --> 01:16:22.756]  We don't need to be afraid of them.
[01:16:22.756 --> 01:16:25.197]  Now, there were people that were in other areas that were carrying guns.
[01:16:25.197 --> 01:16:31.638]  I mean, we've been at many rallies, civil rights rallies, where people are standing up for their open carry rallies.
[01:16:31.638 --> 01:16:38.079]  And one of my sons said, I've filmed three rallies, and the only one where he got attacked was where people weren't carrying guns.
[01:16:38.079 --> 01:16:42.840]  So there is something there, not even pointing guns at him, but knowing that there are people in the crowd that do have guns.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.900]  But for the most part, people were unarmed.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.767]  And just refusing to comply with unlawful orders.
[01:16:49.767 --> 01:16:51.851]  And we stared them down.
[01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:52.893]  And they left.
[01:16:52.893 --> 01:16:54.856]  And it was amazing to see these guys backing up.
[01:16:54.856 --> 01:16:56.118]  There's a clip of them backing up.
[01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:07.415]  Yeah, I think the fact is, is that there were a group of people who had guns pointed at them, and they were saying, we are going to shoot you, we are going to use lethal force, and they didn't back down.
[01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:15.519]  It's not just a victory for this family, it's a victory for the human spirit that these people were willing to stand up and keep moving forward and not stop.
[01:17:15.859 --> 01:17:30.353]  And as you can see from the report that you put together, and again Josh was up all hours of the night trying to get this stuff together because they shut down, that's an interesting point, they shut down the cell phone service in that area for the first several days that we were there in the protest area.
[01:17:30.353 --> 01:17:37.360]  And when somebody wrote a report about how it had been shut down and the Bundy family backed that up, said yeah we used to have pretty good service out here.
[01:17:38.061 --> 01:17:42.544]  On Saturday we had good coverage.
[01:17:42.544 --> 01:17:46.166]  We were able to live stream from the area and that got red linked by Drudge.
[01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:49.448]  That was the first day that we were able to live stream from the area.
[01:17:49.448 --> 01:17:55.772]  For some reason we were able to do it with Skype but we could not get our phones to live stream up until Saturday from that area.
[01:17:55.772 --> 01:17:57.853]  So that changed.
[01:17:57.853 --> 01:18:00.054]  But it was amazing to see these guys back down.
[01:18:00.054 --> 01:18:03.877]  If you see that picture that we just showed up there as them walking back when they gave up
[01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:05.187]  I don't know.
[01:18:23.681 --> 01:18:26.042]  Saying, taking the initiatives, essentially.
[01:18:26.042 --> 01:18:30.785]  What the government, what the people always try to do is to say little things.
[01:18:30.785 --> 01:18:32.626]  Like say, I want you to stand over here.
[01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:33.586]  I want you to come this way.
[01:18:33.586 --> 01:18:35.247]  Let's go over here to talk.
[01:18:35.247 --> 01:18:36.168]  They were giving the orders.
[01:18:36.168 --> 01:18:37.228]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:37.228 --> 01:18:38.589]  But the Bundys were giving the orders.
[01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:40.070]  The Bundys were taking the initiative.
[01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:45.953]  And when people are showing these Homeland Security documents, and maybe they're genuine, maybe they're not, I don't know.
[01:18:45.953 --> 01:18:49.415]  Homeland Security may come out and say, well this is our plan all along.
[01:18:49.415 --> 01:18:50.976]  And I'm sure that they are going to be back.
[01:18:51.636 --> 01:18:53.638]  But I'll tell you what, they were not expecting that.
[01:18:53.638 --> 01:18:55.179]  You know that they were not expecting it.
[01:18:55.179 --> 01:18:55.440]  No.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.943]  It took them completely by surprise that we went to get the cattle.
[01:18:58.943 --> 01:18:59.463]  Yeah.
[01:18:59.463 --> 01:19:00.404]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:19:00.404 --> 01:19:00.685]  Yeah.
[01:19:00.685 --> 01:19:08.452]  And the fact that that guy, I don't know who he was, BLM, whatever he was, the guy with the beard with the glasses, he was like, we're trying to de-escalate the situation.
[01:19:08.632 --> 01:19:11.373]  We're trying to make you guys, you know, we're trying to make this safe.
[01:19:11.373 --> 01:19:16.036]  While there are guys standing behind and pointing guns at us saying that if you come any closer, you're going to get shot.
[01:19:16.036 --> 01:19:19.477]  And Ammon said, no, you're going to leave.
[01:19:19.477 --> 01:19:20.658]  Those are the terms.
[01:19:20.658 --> 01:19:21.638]  You leave.
[01:19:21.638 --> 01:19:22.158]  That's right.
[01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:28.722]  And I heard it bothered me so much to go back to the motel rooms were downloading the footage, transcribing the footage.
[01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:37.806]  I flipped on the news and I saw Fox News reporting this and basically saying that they stood this down because they were concerned about the safety of the public.
[01:19:38.266 --> 01:19:39.807]  They were the ones pointing guns at us.
[01:19:39.807 --> 01:19:41.307]  We weren't pointing guns at them.
[01:19:41.307 --> 01:19:44.448]  The people down there in the trenches were unarmed.
[01:19:44.448 --> 01:19:47.589]  Or they had their guns shouldered, holstered like Ryan there.
[01:19:47.589 --> 01:19:49.190]  We're going to be right back with Josh Owens.
[01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:53.892]  We're going to be talking to Alex at the bottom of the hour as to what this means across the spectrum.
[01:19:53.892 --> 01:19:58.493]  And Jerome Corsi about China buying out America.
[01:19:58.493 --> 01:19:59.714]  Making good on their federal debt.
[01:19:59.714 --> 01:20:00.354]  We'll be right back.

[01:22:58.524 --> 01:23:01.365]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:01.365 --> 01:23:06.488]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:23:06.488 --> 01:23:14.611]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:14.611 --> 01:23:19.133]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:23:19.133 --> 01:23:22.935]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:23.095 --> 01:23:29.040]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:32.222]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:32.222 --> 01:23:37.586]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:23:54.925 --> 01:23:57.594]  MyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[01:24:13.953 --> 01:24:15.314]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:15.314 --> 01:24:18.376]  I'm David Knight, joined in studio here with Josh Owens.
[01:24:18.376 --> 01:24:32.525]  We just got back from the standoff in Bunkerville, Nevada, where people stood up to federal agents pointing loaded guns at us, threatening to kill us, threatening to shoot, threatening to use lethal force if we did not leave the area.
[01:24:32.525 --> 01:24:34.547]  They said they had a court order, Josh.
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:35.860]  Yeah.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:39.061]  Oh yeah, they had a court order to use lethal force to kill everyone out there.
[01:24:39.061 --> 01:24:39.661]  Right.
[01:24:39.661 --> 01:24:48.163]  And, I mean, the people that were on the other side of the fence, the citizens and the bundies, they weren't standing behind shields.
[01:24:48.163 --> 01:24:48.823]  That's right.
[01:24:48.823 --> 01:24:52.784]  But the other guys, they had their doors open, they were standing behind shields because they're cowards.
[01:24:52.784 --> 01:25:00.065]  Full body armor, helmets, and standing behind their doors, standing behind their vehicles with a loudspeaker saying, go away, go away.
[01:25:00.065 --> 01:25:02.246]  It was amazing because there were so many of us
[01:25:03.426 --> 01:25:05.507]  And we outnumbered them by so many.
[01:25:05.507 --> 01:25:14.733]  They truly were afraid, even though they had their shields, their body armor, their weapons pointed at us, and their loudspeaker threatening us about their supposed court order.
[01:25:14.733 --> 01:25:16.934]  You know, they were very much afraid.
[01:25:16.934 --> 01:25:19.256]  And it was great to see them backing up.
[01:25:19.256 --> 01:25:22.718]  They would not turn their backs on us as we shouted at them.
[01:25:22.718 --> 01:25:24.399]  We were not threatening them.
[01:25:24.399 --> 01:25:25.419]  They were threatening us.
[01:25:25.419 --> 01:25:32.684]  And yet the way they put this out from the BLM press release and the way it was reported by the mainstream media was that they were worried about the safety of the public.
[01:25:33.104 --> 01:25:34.906]  They were the ones pointing guns at us.
[01:25:34.906 --> 01:25:36.868]  They were the ones threatening to shoot us.
[01:25:36.868 --> 01:25:41.552]  We were the ones walking to them with arms up in the air, with flags in the air.
[01:25:41.552 --> 01:25:45.595]  It was a V for Vendetta moment, but with cowboys on horses.
[01:25:45.595 --> 01:25:47.877]  It was a great moment.
[01:25:47.877 --> 01:25:55.985]  Let me talk about where we go from this, because we've got Obamacare that's been put in by a lawful court order.
[01:25:56.934 --> 01:25:58.275]  Is it legal?
[01:25:58.275 --> 01:26:16.165]  Just because the Supreme Court Justice says this, just because Roberts, who had already written an opinion saying that it was not legal, then for some reason, maybe it was one of the first cases of the NSA blackmailing somebody, who knows, because we see, right after that we saw things happening with Petraeus.
[01:26:16.165 --> 01:26:18.066]  Was it the first instance of them blackmailing somebody?
[01:26:18.066 --> 01:26:20.248]  Because we've got the Supreme Court Justice Roberts.
[01:26:21.277 --> 01:26:26.699]  Writing both the majority opinion and the dissenting opinion.
[01:26:26.699 --> 01:26:27.719]  Reversing himself.
[01:26:27.719 --> 01:26:28.820]  Very dramatically.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:31.621]  And so, does that then alter the Constitution?
[01:26:31.621 --> 01:26:32.621]  We can read the Constitution.
[01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:37.483]  We know that the government does not have the right to force us to buy something.
[01:26:37.483 --> 01:26:40.344]  They don't have any rights that are not specifically given to them.
[01:26:40.344 --> 01:26:50.348]  That's why they went through the motions of doing a constitutional amendment to create the income tax that tomorrow is the day that they want everybody to file the income tax.
[01:26:51.493 --> 01:26:55.194]  When they did that, they made it about income, and that was very different from wages.
[01:26:55.194 --> 01:26:59.435]  Then they extended it during World War II to wages, said they were going to do it temporarily, then they kept that on.
[01:26:59.435 --> 01:27:04.416]  Now they've put on Obamacare, and said they're going to use the IRS on Obamacare.
[01:27:04.416 --> 01:27:05.356]  How do we get out of this?
[01:27:05.356 --> 01:27:09.197]  Well, there's a good example back in November 15th.
[01:27:09.197 --> 01:27:10.998]  Jury nullification.
[01:27:10.998 --> 01:27:11.818]  Jury nullification.
[01:27:12.762 --> 01:27:13.823]  Go for your trial.
[01:27:13.823 --> 01:27:14.683]  Stand up for each other.
[01:27:43.603 --> 01:27:48.328]  In this particular case, you had a woman who owed no taxes.
[01:27:48.328 --> 01:27:50.370]  She refused to sign the form.
[01:27:50.370 --> 01:27:55.616]  The IRS wanted her to fill it out using their numbers, and their numbers, of course, were zero.
[01:27:55.616 --> 01:28:03.964]  She said she wasn't going to do that, and so what they did was they took her to court, charged her with contempt, and this is what the judge said.
[01:28:05.114 --> 01:28:06.615]  This is how she instructed the jury.
[01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:12.620]  She said that it's not a defense to the crime of contempt that the court order was unlawful or unconstitutional.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:13.701]  You hear that?
[01:28:13.701 --> 01:28:17.704]  It doesn't matter if what I'm telling you is unlawful and unconstitutional.
[01:28:17.704 --> 01:28:19.165]  You do it!
[01:28:19.165 --> 01:28:22.367]  And that's the attitude we saw out there with the BLM.
[01:28:22.367 --> 01:28:23.008]  It doesn't matter.
[01:28:23.008 --> 01:28:26.290]  The law is in our mouth.
[01:28:26.290 --> 01:28:26.550]  Okay?
[01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:27.391]  It's a fiat law.
[01:28:27.391 --> 01:28:28.232]  It's a dictatorship.
[01:28:29.884 --> 01:28:31.625]  Yeah, I think, what was the ruling?
[01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:33.366]  It was Marbury versus Madison.
[01:28:33.366 --> 01:28:37.689]  I could be wrong about that, where it said that if it's unconstitutional, then you don't have to follow the law.
[01:28:37.689 --> 01:28:43.673]  Yeah, well, you know, what we're seeing here with this is essentially, we have to understand what the Constitution is.
[01:28:43.673 --> 01:28:48.696]  We have to understand when the laws are counterfeit, or when they're just fiat, okay?
[01:28:48.696 --> 01:28:52.558]  When they're fiat laws, we need to know what the real law is so we can stand it down.
[01:28:52.558 --> 01:28:55.200]  Now, the question is, what do we do about Obamacare?
[01:28:55.871 --> 01:29:10.256]  In this particular case, in this lady's case, just because she would not sign the form, they take her to jail, they were trying to put her in jail, and they're instructing the jury that it doesn't matter if what I tell you is unlawful and unconstitutional.
[01:29:10.256 --> 01:29:10.736]  Well, you know what?
[01:29:10.736 --> 01:29:19.739]  There was one juror who stood up, even though he was hounded by the prosecutor's office, he stood up, nullified this.
[01:29:19.739 --> 01:29:22.900]  It takes one person out of 12, only 8% to stand up.
[01:29:24.929 --> 01:29:34.032]  Yeah, well, what I see a lot is when we go out on the street, do these men on the streets, and people ask, well, yeah, this stuff is going on, but what are we supposed to do about it?
[01:29:34.032 --> 01:29:34.772]  Look at this family.
[01:29:34.772 --> 01:29:35.733]  Look what they did.
[01:29:35.733 --> 01:29:36.973]  This is what you do about it.
[01:29:36.973 --> 01:29:37.934]  You don't sit down.
[01:29:37.934 --> 01:29:38.894]  You don't take the easy way out.
[01:29:38.894 --> 01:29:39.394]  That's right.
[01:29:39.394 --> 01:29:40.314]  We're going to be right back.
[01:29:40.314 --> 01:29:46.497]  We're going to be joined at the bottom of the hour with Jerome Corsi, and I'm going to give you last words here, Josh, when we come back.
[01:29:46.497 --> 01:29:46.917]  Stay tuned.
[01:29:46.917 --> 01:29:49.778]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:49.778 --> 01:29:51.158]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.158 --> 01:29:52.659]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.681 --> 01:30:00.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.624 --> 01:30:04.666]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:30:04.666 --> 01:30:09.008]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:30:09.008 --> 01:30:12.689]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:30:12.689 --> 01:30:15.731]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:30:15.731 --> 01:30:23.074]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:23.294 --> 01:30:27.218]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:27.218 --> 01:30:31.622]  New filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:31.622 --> 01:30:37.607]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:30:37.607 --> 01:30:41.670]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:44.293]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:30:44.293 --> 01:30:45.634]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:47.135]  It's time to take action.
[01:30:47.135 --> 01:30:48.957]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:31:00.666 --> 01:31:07.792]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:07.912 --> 01:31:10.293]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:10.293 --> 01:31:15.636]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:20.879]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:20.879 --> 01:31:23.981]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:24.261 --> 01:31:28.404]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:28.404 --> 01:31:32.787]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:43.154]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:43.154 --> 01:31:54.101]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:31:54.221 --> 01:32:00.624]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:00.624 --> 01:32:10.810]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:32:11.010 --> 01:32:18.115]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:32:18.115 --> 01:32:22.999]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:32:22.999 --> 01:32:29.784]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:29.784 --> 01:32:36.869]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:32:36.929 --> 01:32:43.975]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:32:43.975 --> 01:32:48.459]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:32:48.459 --> 01:32:58.167]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:32:58.167 --> 01:32:59.848]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:11.164 --> 01:33:13.812]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:13.812 --> 01:33:15.176]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.221 --> 01:33:19.702]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:19.702 --> 01:33:27.549]  I'm David Knight, and we've been talking about the standoff and the stand-down of the militarized BLM presence there.
[01:33:27.549 --> 01:33:29.390]  They essentially had martial law.
[01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:30.571]  No free speech.
[01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:37.397]  Anybody that steps foot on there, on the king's land, is going to immediately be taken down, tased, arrested, brutalized.
[01:33:37.397 --> 01:33:40.299]  Sniper nests, observation posts.
[01:33:40.299 --> 01:33:43.462]  It was martial law, even though they didn't declare it.
[01:33:43.462 --> 01:33:44.323]  And what took it down?
[01:33:45.296 --> 01:33:45.536]  I think?
[01:34:05.325 --> 01:34:13.772]  Now, Neil Korns was one of the senior policy advisors for Harry Reid, just as his son was a chief lobbyist for one of these solar projects.
[01:34:13.772 --> 01:34:25.802]  And Alex, they needed to get the rights to that area so they could use it like carbon credits, so they could take off his property rights, so they could put their property on there and sell it off as a kind of crony capitalism.
[01:34:25.802 --> 01:34:34.489]  And we're going to have Jerome Corsi joining us at the top of the hour, talking about how the Chinese government is trying to do this in myriad ways throughout the country.
[01:34:35.267 --> 01:34:38.229]  Well, that's right, and that's why this is such a big deal.
[01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:41.751]  That's why it's really a keystone or a Rosetta Stone.
[01:34:41.751 --> 01:34:48.636]  Because as I said when I popped in earlier, I want to recap that and then walk through this for folks, why it's so important.
[01:34:48.636 --> 01:34:50.357]  It's a propaganda victory for liberty.
[01:34:51.522 --> 01:34:58.644]  If they would have shot a hundred of those people, it would have been a victory for liberty, but would have probably started a physical revolution.
[01:34:58.644 --> 01:35:00.925]  So we don't want that to happen.
[01:35:00.925 --> 01:35:12.528]  But we would have had the moral high ground when the revolution starts to restore the Republic and could have ended the Civil War a lot quicker than if they staged a new Oklahoma City.
[01:35:13.686 --> 01:35:20.488]  To blame on us, to make us look bad, to start the civil war preemptively where they have the jump.
[01:35:20.488 --> 01:35:23.229]  And this is how governments and systems think.
[01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:31.852]  If you go back to Egypt and the Israelites coming out, it was over land and abuse and torture and uprisings.
[01:35:31.852 --> 01:35:33.652]  Moses.
[01:35:33.652 --> 01:35:35.393]  If you look at what happened in 1989.
[01:35:37.176 --> 01:35:48.586]  In East Germany, that you mentioned earlier, and we've had former members of the Stasi secret police on, who hated the regime, didn't like what was going on, were ordered to arrest or shoot people that tried to get out of the country or get out of East Berlin.
[01:35:48.586 --> 01:35:49.907]  They finally just stood down.
[01:35:50.848 --> 01:35:56.315]  They finally just did their job and so the Berlin Wall came down.
[01:35:56.315 --> 01:36:05.768]  We saw this in Romania with Ceaușescu right around the same time where the Ministry of Police were aiming their guns at the people and the people started marching forward.
[01:36:05.768 --> 01:36:06.509]  They shot a few.
[01:36:07.401 --> 01:36:13.964]  But then the other guards got really freaked out and the police threw their guns down, or turned their guns on the military and started shooting them.
[01:36:13.964 --> 01:36:15.245]  Let me interject something here.
[01:36:15.245 --> 01:36:20.887]  One of the Bundy daughters said she went over and she talked to one of these guys who was in one of the vehicles.
[01:36:20.887 --> 01:36:23.168]  I think it was the night when they had stopped it.
[01:36:23.168 --> 01:36:25.970]  I'm not sure exactly the time, but she... Doesn't matter, just... Yeah, and she said...
[01:36:27.451 --> 01:36:28.751]  Why are you doing this?
[01:36:28.751 --> 01:36:29.932]  Don't you understand what's going on here?
[01:36:29.932 --> 01:36:33.295]  He goes, yeah, I don't want to be doing this, but it's my job.
[01:36:33.295 --> 01:36:34.155]  Are you proud of this?
[01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:38.979]  He says, my grandfather would be so ashamed of me at this point.
[01:36:38.979 --> 01:36:41.500]  He understood that what he was doing was wrong.
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:47.024]  He was this close to doing the right thing because there is a higher law.
[01:36:47.024 --> 01:36:47.404]  That's right.
[01:36:47.404 --> 01:36:48.485]  A higher moral law.
[01:36:48.485 --> 01:36:50.086]  Plus, he has the grazing rights.
[01:36:50.086 --> 01:36:52.688]  It's just like if people stop paying property taxes.
[01:36:52.688 --> 01:36:53.589]  People go, well, that's the law.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:57.621]  Property tax is from feudal Europe and feudal Japan.
[01:36:57.621 --> 01:36:58.242]  Yes.
[01:36:58.242 --> 01:36:59.902]  It means you didn't own your land.
[01:36:59.902 --> 01:37:01.063]  It meant you were a renter.
[01:37:01.063 --> 01:37:02.704]  It is a government rent.
[01:37:02.704 --> 01:37:04.104]  We did not have it anywhere in the U.S.
[01:37:04.104 --> 01:37:05.165]  until about a hundred years ago.
[01:37:06.044 --> 01:37:09.267]  It's only been phased in nationwide in the last 30 years.
[01:37:09.267 --> 01:37:11.430]  But people now think that's normal.
[01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:15.434]  Mondays like, my family's been here forever, we have the grazing rights, we've never paid it.
[01:37:15.434 --> 01:37:17.436]  He goes, I'll pay it to the state.
[01:37:17.436 --> 01:37:18.737]  And he's saying that's legitimate.
[01:37:18.737 --> 01:37:19.759]  I don't think that's legitimate.
[01:37:19.759 --> 01:37:24.964]  I don't think the state, even though it's more legitimate than the feds, trumps something that you've had on record.
[01:37:26.045 --> 01:37:26.805]  This is the same thing.
[01:37:26.805 --> 01:37:28.526]  This is the domestication process.
[01:37:28.526 --> 01:37:30.286]  It's why they don't want lemonade stands.
[01:37:30.286 --> 01:37:32.467]  It's why they don't want local farmers markets.
[01:37:32.467 --> 01:37:33.727]  It's why they harass them.
[01:37:33.727 --> 01:37:35.848]  Because the big corporations want it shut down.
[01:37:35.848 --> 01:37:38.629]  So here's the larger issue.
[01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:48.772]  Worldwide, from Burma to Mexico, from the United States and Nevada to areas of Europe, they're banning cook stoves.
[01:37:48.772 --> 01:37:50.892]  They're banning wood stoves.
[01:37:50.892 --> 01:37:53.353]  They are forcing indigenous populations
[01:37:54.483 --> 01:37:55.684]  Off of their land.
[01:37:55.684 --> 01:37:57.706]  People don't know why Mexico City doubled in size the last 30 years.
[01:37:57.706 --> 01:38:00.248]  It's because they forced more than 10 million people who own their land but live there so long.
[01:38:00.248 --> 01:38:01.709]  They would say, well, where's your deed?
[01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:17.801]  Well, my great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
[01:38:18.231 --> 01:38:18.371]  Yeah.
[01:38:34.304 --> 01:38:34.864]  I don't think so.
[01:38:57.849 --> 01:39:01.631]  But then look here, they have limits on us fishing, but not the big trawlers.
[01:39:01.631 --> 01:39:05.653]  See, it's the globalists shutting everything down.
[01:39:05.653 --> 01:39:12.717]  And we learned it's China, it's Harry Reid, it's the BLM head, they're all involved in this.
[01:39:12.717 --> 01:39:17.379]  It's totally illegal on its face, just like all the other scams they run.
[01:39:17.379 --> 01:39:18.380]  Just like Obamacare.
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:19.320]  Just like Obamacare.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:19.880]  So it's a Jena 21,
[01:39:21.368 --> 01:39:25.911]  Takeover, and the public's so ignorant, they're now saying it's a privilege to be a parent.
[01:39:25.911 --> 01:39:27.692]  It's a privilege to own a gun.
[01:39:27.692 --> 01:39:29.773]  It's not a privilege to travel.
[01:39:29.773 --> 01:39:31.975]  But the average cop goes, it's a privilege for you to travel.
[01:39:31.975 --> 01:39:32.715]  No, it's not.
[01:39:32.715 --> 01:39:34.957]  If I'm in commerce, it is.
[01:39:34.957 --> 01:39:35.697]  A commerce clause.
[01:39:35.697 --> 01:39:37.799]  See, we have the federal and state rulings.
[01:39:38.459 --> 01:39:39.581]  We're informed.
[01:39:39.581 --> 01:39:41.023]  And that's what I see everybody pushing back.
[01:39:41.023 --> 01:39:43.126]  They're saying the government had rights.
[01:39:43.126 --> 01:39:44.888]  The government owned this land.
[01:39:44.888 --> 01:39:45.889]  He has a privilege.
[01:39:45.889 --> 01:39:46.730]  He has permission.
[01:39:46.730 --> 01:39:47.451]  He violated that.
[01:39:47.451 --> 01:39:48.593]  They can remove that.
[01:39:48.593 --> 01:39:49.895]  We don't have any rights anymore.
[01:39:49.895 --> 01:39:52.118]  We only have permissions and privileges according to the law.
[01:39:52.118 --> 01:39:54.881]  And that's why when you say the government owns things, only the government has rights.
[01:39:54.881 --> 01:39:55.242]  Exactly.
[01:39:55.282 --> 01:40:00.685]  That's why when you go to National Park or someplace, which this wasn't even that, they let you know you're lucky to be here.
[01:40:00.685 --> 01:40:02.967]  Because it's all, they know they've stolen it all.
[01:40:02.967 --> 01:40:04.148]  So they're guilty.
[01:40:04.148 --> 01:40:06.229]  So they want to make you feel guilty, so accept it.
[01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:09.091]  But to expose to people, 90% of Nevada, it was 87, 90% of Nevada is federal.
[01:40:09.091 --> 01:40:09.791]  Federally managed.
[01:40:15.936 --> 01:40:25.020]  But then they want to charge you and all the rest of it, come on it, so they can spend three, four, five million dollars to go after some guy and his cattle in the Millennial world.
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:28.681]  No, it's about them putting the solar farms just south of him.
[01:40:28.681 --> 01:40:31.902]  And in the expansion, phase two, it does go to close to his property.
[01:40:31.902 --> 01:40:33.623]  And then, as you said, this is the buffer zone.
[01:40:33.623 --> 01:40:36.244]  If you read the New York Times last year, Paul Watson wrote about it.
[01:40:37.728 --> 01:40:46.095]  They have mercenary groups for the UN going in to Uganda and literally burning and killing villages when they won't leave, shooting people.
[01:40:46.095 --> 01:40:58.906]  The New York Times admitted this to take their ancestral native lands off limits so they can have mines and strip mining and clear-cutting next door in an IMF World Bank controlled project.
[01:40:59.778 --> 01:41:01.360]  So you understand it's the exact same thing.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.882]  It's the same program worldwide.
[01:41:03.882 --> 01:41:08.087]  And the New York Times talked about the mercenaries lining people up and shooting them.
[01:41:08.087 --> 01:41:10.609]  And I tell people who love the U.N.
[01:41:10.609 --> 01:41:13.812]  and, you know, every model has to give, you know, and girls all wear the U.N.
[01:41:13.812 --> 01:41:16.215]  shirts because they care about the kids, that, you know, hey, the U.N.'
[01:41:16.195 --> 01:41:18.517]  's running extermination programs under AFRICAN.
[01:41:18.517 --> 01:41:20.960]  They don't even believe it till you show them
[01:41:22.366 --> 01:41:26.027]  Till you show them the actual documentation.
[01:41:26.027 --> 01:41:27.268]  Till you show them what's going on.
[01:41:27.268 --> 01:41:29.969]  So, this is a world fight here.
[01:41:29.969 --> 01:41:34.191]  And the point is, at Ruby Ridge, they killed the people.
[01:41:34.191 --> 01:41:36.612]  At Waco, they burned them down and killed the people.
[01:41:36.612 --> 01:41:41.274]  At all these modern events, the feds have not backed down, and it's blown up in their face.
[01:41:41.274 --> 01:41:44.335]  See, we win either way, but we don't want people to die.
[01:41:44.335 --> 01:41:46.736]  And the historic magnitude
[01:41:47.757 --> 01:41:50.359]  I would say close to a thousand people there, would you say?
[01:41:50.359 --> 01:41:51.040]  Oh yeah.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:57.545]  Hundreds of people on horseback, massing, and people on loudspeakers saying, we're going to shoot you.
[01:41:57.545 --> 01:42:00.947]  You come up to the fences and they say, back off and we'll leave.
[01:42:00.947 --> 01:42:01.488]  No, we're not.
[01:42:01.488 --> 01:42:07.092]  Tear down the fences, march in with guys up on the berms, snipers, armored vehicles.
[01:42:07.092 --> 01:42:10.454]  You guys are so close, you're only showing part of it there on the video for TV viewers.
[01:42:11.415 --> 01:42:14.839]  And Drudge is, you know, linked to this video the last few days.
[01:42:14.839 --> 01:42:20.724]  In fact, we'll give folks the name of the video and show them the article here in just a moment, so we can give it out and folks can go check it out.
[01:42:20.724 --> 01:42:26.249]  In fact, ask Don or one of the guys to post it back as the top story on InfoWars.com.
[01:42:26.249 --> 01:42:27.150]  There it is, historic.
[01:42:27.150 --> 01:42:30.073]  Feds force a surrender to American citizens.
[01:42:30.073 --> 01:42:32.816]  People on YouTube, a minority of them, say, Alex,
[01:42:34.162 --> 01:42:35.845]  Why are you so excited about this?
[01:42:35.845 --> 01:42:37.207]  The Feds will come back.
[01:42:37.207 --> 01:42:38.029]  This isn't over.
[01:42:38.029 --> 01:42:39.271]  I know that.
[01:42:39.271 --> 01:42:45.101]  The point is, is that the iconography, the archetypal image, right out of V for Vendetta...
[01:42:46.073 --> 01:42:52.098]  of where the people are marching on the Capitol and the military's been ordered to shoot them and they stand down.
[01:42:52.098 --> 01:42:54.640]  That's how Ceausescu fell.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.441]  It's how the East Germans fell.
[01:42:56.441 --> 01:42:58.803]  It's how the old Soviet bloc fell.
[01:42:58.803 --> 01:43:01.806]  It's how every corrupt system falls.
[01:43:01.806 --> 01:43:05.549]  Now I don't want the system to totally fall because you've got a parallel republic
[01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:09.652]  And the New World Order takeover system that's using the old system to take it over.
[01:43:09.652 --> 01:43:18.600]  I want to reboot the Republic before the globalists under Agenda 21 economically and culturally collapse us and imposes the Savior.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:21.923]  See, they create the false crisis that imposes revolutionaries.
[01:43:21.923 --> 01:43:27.689]  They're going to try to bring in a leftist system when they couldn't control the Occupy movement.
[01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:29.310]  And that's what it's been about for a long time.
[01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:30.070]  They then slushed it.
[01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.550]  Yeah.
[01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:34.452]  You go back, all the way back to the time of Robert McNamara, the IMF.
[01:43:34.452 --> 01:43:39.274]  They were accused of, and the correct way to put this out, is just rent-seeking.
[01:43:39.274 --> 01:43:42.896]  Essentially turning all of us into serfs, into sluts, who don't own anything.
[01:43:42.896 --> 01:43:43.096]  That's it.
[01:43:43.096 --> 01:43:43.556]  Via laws.
[01:43:43.556 --> 01:43:44.477]  They own everything.
[01:43:44.477 --> 01:43:50.940]  And that's why the BLM is going from management to ownership, so then they can transfer that to the globalists.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.965]  Well that's right, and of course before with the BLM, people wouldn't put up with this.
[01:43:56.965 --> 01:44:15.260]  And it's like, I've got a ranch here for seven generations, five generations, and I've always run my cattle on this before this was there, and so they know that this sector of the public land is where such-and-such runs his sheep, or is where such-and-such runs his cattle, or is where such-and-such grows his oats.
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:18.823]  The point is that's the way that's always been, out west where more than half the land's federal.
[01:44:19.659 --> 01:44:25.125]  They prey on the ignorance of the public to not know this, but this is what it all comes down to.
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:51.294]  is that is that it shows that the feds didn't want a new left center concord they they didn't want at the point of where the people called their bluff they back down and it shows the moral authority and it was because of the iconography it was because of the images of the people in the cowboy hats the american flags the whole deal we the real america were reclaiming
[01:44:52.199 --> 01:45:09.244]  The country from the hired mercenaries out in the middle of the desert at extreme expense, who've run off the 52 other families, bought them out, forced them out, now bluffing and lying and saying, well, you wouldn't sell Bundy, so now we say you owe us grazing rights.
[01:45:09.244 --> 01:45:19.828]  They just pulled that out of the air, had some federal judge certify it, when all the precedents, all the history, all the state rulings, all the other federal rulings show that this is about calling their fraud.
[01:45:19.828 --> 01:45:20.928]  And if people ever realize
[01:45:21.388 --> 01:45:27.011]  No amount of property taxes, no amount of grazing fees, no amount of cops writing tickets will ever pay for this.
[01:45:27.011 --> 01:45:34.956]  The more taxes we get, the poorer we get, because the globalists have signed the federal taxes onto derivatives.
[01:45:34.956 --> 01:45:38.438]  1.5 quadrillion, 700 trillion U.S.
[01:45:38.438 --> 01:45:40.399]  is our global portion.
[01:45:40.399 --> 01:45:42.060]  This is all on record at Davos.
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:44.042]  This is all openly in the mainstream news.
[01:45:45.731 --> 01:45:47.673]  90 plus percent of that is not even our debt.
[01:45:47.673 --> 01:45:53.837]  They've signed us onto a black hole that no amount of money will pay off precisely because of that.
[01:45:53.837 --> 01:46:00.941]  They've signed America, this engine of liberty, this engine of wealth, onto a giant bill that's not ours.
[01:46:00.941 --> 01:46:03.403]  It's so big that nothing will pay it off.
[01:46:03.403 --> 01:46:05.164]  And so why do they want the taxes so high?
[01:46:05.164 --> 01:46:06.025]  It bankrupts everybody.
[01:46:07.346 --> 01:46:08.687]  Three words.
[01:46:08.687 --> 01:46:10.729]  They are exempt.
[01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:16.934]  On record, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Bushes, the Obamas, all these people are basically tax-exempt.
[01:46:16.934 --> 01:46:22.498]  GE, Google, I mean, most of these companies pay zero tax.
[01:46:22.498 --> 01:46:27.082]  Warren Buffett, oh, he's so nice, he put $100 billion with Bill and Melinda Gates and his foundation.
[01:46:27.082 --> 01:46:30.024]  You go look at it, they run their companies as tax-free now.
[01:46:30.024 --> 01:46:35.388]  They live in giant mansions with their helicopters and everything, free, because it's owned by the foundation.
[01:46:36.354 --> 01:46:40.575]  You or I can't go do that with our $300,000, $400,000 when we retire.
[01:46:40.575 --> 01:46:42.415]  Hopefully we've got saved.
[01:46:42.415 --> 01:46:43.756]  It's being inflated away.
[01:46:43.756 --> 01:46:48.997]  We can't do that with our house because the property taxes always go up to eat out the profit.
[01:46:48.997 --> 01:46:52.998]  The money changers are up against the free market.
[01:46:52.998 --> 01:46:55.579]  They call it overheating when the economy starts growing past 3.5%.
[01:46:57.369 --> 01:47:01.634]  We had 10% growth rates from 1789 right through the Great Depression.
[01:47:01.634 --> 01:47:05.618]  But ever since our country went into receivership, it's never ended.
[01:47:05.618 --> 01:47:06.960]  It's just gotten worse and worse.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:09.743]  From the richest nation in the world to the most indebted.
[01:47:09.743 --> 01:47:12.606]  From the healthiest nation in the world to the most sick.
[01:47:12.606 --> 01:47:17.092]  From the most aggressive and inventive nation to the most slovenly and dumbed down on every front.
[01:47:18.104 --> 01:47:21.066]  We can rediscover the animating spirit of liberty.
[01:47:21.066 --> 01:47:28.170]  What happened in Nevada, when we have the moral high ground, when exercised over and over again, they're buying armored vehicles.
[01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:42.099]  They're trying to take on the Tea Party, and gun owners, and libertarians, because the globalists have looked at the only opposition in this country that articulately knows it's a global, UN, banking, cartel takeover.
[01:47:42.099 --> 01:47:43.380]  They've already seized the country.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.221]  They believe they own the country through fraud.
[01:47:46.221 --> 01:47:47.822]  They believe they've conquered it.
[01:47:47.822 --> 01:47:50.403]  But if we ever go, wait a minute, you did this by fraud.
[01:47:50.403 --> 01:47:52.384]  The Federal Reserve's not federal.
[01:47:52.384 --> 01:47:53.484]  Wait a minute.
[01:47:53.484 --> 01:48:04.569]  When the cops figure out why their parents are going bankrupt, when the firemen figure out why that's happened, when the FBI agents, you know, has their kid die of cancer and finds out, wait a minute, that brain cancer virus
[01:48:05.689 --> 01:48:08.614]  Is in vaccines when they find out their little kid died?
[01:48:08.614 --> 01:48:13.843]  See, the New World Order is going to hurt people so bad that there's no way we can lose.
[01:48:13.843 --> 01:48:18.570]  The question is, how far do we go down this hellhole before we find our fighting spirit?
[01:48:19.056 --> 01:48:21.058]  That's right, and that's exactly what we saw happening here.
[01:48:21.058 --> 01:48:26.845]  When we played that clip from Ammon Bundy, he said, these are hills that we grew up on for generations.
[01:48:26.845 --> 01:48:28.146]  We were free to roam them.
[01:48:28.146 --> 01:48:33.172]  And one day... They beat up teenagers that pull up with their trucks and their girlfriends to fish.
[01:48:33.172 --> 01:48:35.835]  BLM shows up with guns and says, what are you doing here?
[01:48:35.835 --> 01:48:36.176]  Exactly.
[01:48:36.176 --> 01:48:38.899]  I mean, literally a bunch of armed, crazy goons running around.
[01:48:39.119 --> 01:48:42.903]  One day they wake up and they got snipers on the hills with their guns pointed at them.
[01:48:42.903 --> 01:48:54.334]  And Kit Daniels found the documents where the Walton Family Foundation says we'll give $400,000 to help the environment here as soon as you get the Bundys off of their ranch.
[01:48:54.334 --> 01:48:56.016]  As soon as you get their trespass cattle off.
[01:48:56.016 --> 01:49:00.601]  And of course that same family foundation, the guy who runs it, is sitting on the board of First Solar.
[01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:07.144]  Which is going to, has already broken ground for their solar project using the Bundy Ranch.
[01:49:07.144 --> 01:49:07.805]  It's incredible.
[01:49:07.805 --> 01:49:08.385]  Mitigation.
[01:49:08.385 --> 01:49:17.770]  And then the Chinese backed, Chinese government backed Group 5 billion to come bring in this infrastructure, which we could put in anyways, but is a boondoggle.
[01:49:18.661 --> 01:49:25.364]  All this is, all these energy deals to the Democrats are literally just payoffs.
[01:49:25.364 --> 01:49:33.827]  It's like when George Herbert Walker Bush gets paid a million dollars to speak in Japan or Beijing, in Tokyo or in Beijing.
[01:49:33.827 --> 01:49:39.569]  It's on record, that's what those are from these governments when the Saudis pay Bill Clinton a million bucks to come speak over there.
[01:49:39.569 --> 01:49:41.290]  Okay, a million dollars, folks.
[01:49:42.981 --> 01:49:47.924]  That's all this is, is a total takeover of our civilization.
[01:49:47.924 --> 01:49:50.305]  And so they've got their blueprint, we've got ours.
[01:49:50.305 --> 01:49:57.989]  We tell the story, we tell the narrative, with the imagery of us at the Alamo with our guns defying the police and their unconstitutional law, they back down there.
[01:49:58.649 --> 01:49:59.109]  Remember that?
[01:49:59.109 --> 01:50:00.990]  That was just a few months ago.
[01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:06.591]  You guys go and you do this and walk towards the guns as they're saying they're going to shoot you.
[01:50:06.591 --> 01:50:09.992]  And they're sitting there thinking, man, am I going to just shoot some people?
[01:50:09.992 --> 01:50:11.952]  Plus, it's like Lexington.
[01:50:11.952 --> 01:50:14.073]  You guys had your guns down at your side.
[01:50:14.073 --> 01:50:14.733]  You were reporters.
[01:50:14.733 --> 01:50:16.193]  You had a video camera as a gun.
[01:50:16.193 --> 01:50:18.734]  But the people with guns, once the feds started shooting,
[01:50:19.845 --> 01:50:25.209]  People were going to be shooting back and see now there's the realization, oh you're really going to have a civil war now.
[01:50:25.209 --> 01:50:30.613]  You're really going to die for the lie, for the fraud of you didn't build it.
[01:50:30.613 --> 01:50:32.474]  Bundy, you didn't build this.
[01:50:32.474 --> 01:50:35.716]  Your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, seven generations didn't build this.
[01:50:35.716 --> 01:50:41.720]  Get off because we got a bunch of Chinese communists and Harry Reid and people and the Walton Foundation.
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:44.082]  What do you think Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club and all these groups do?
[01:50:44.522 --> 01:50:51.388]  They come in, they get you to sell your land out for nothing, they flip it and build condos on it ten years later and nobody remembers.
[01:50:51.388 --> 01:50:55.371]  I'm going to come back with one more segment with you, David, and I'm going to turn it over to you and Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:50:55.371 --> 01:50:58.934]  We've got a bunch of other news as well coming up, but this is historical.
[01:50:58.934 --> 01:50:59.555]  This is a big deal.
[01:51:01.687 --> 01:51:09.412]  Jessica Armand here, creator of My Magic Mud, the all-natural teeth whitener and strengthening remedy that's getting rave reviews from GCN listeners.
[01:51:09.412 --> 01:51:12.715]  Here's what Austin dentist Dr. Griffin Cole has to say about it.
[01:51:12.715 --> 01:51:14.416]  I really love this Magic Mud product.
[01:51:14.416 --> 01:51:20.540]  Because charcoal is so absorbent, it's very effective at taking off all the sticky plaque and debris that gets stuck on our teeth every day.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.101]  I highly recommend My Magic Mud.
[01:51:22.101 --> 01:51:25.964]  Visit MyMagicMud.com to hear the full interview with Dr. Cole.

[01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:33.413]  You've heard about the lowest price promise at Emergency Essentials.
[01:51:33.413 --> 01:51:34.254]  But did you know?

[01:52:00.177 --> 01:52:03.259]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:52:03.259 --> 01:52:05.381]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[01:52:05.381 --> 01:52:11.285]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[01:52:11.605 --> 01:52:12.527]  We're good to go.
[01:52:26.547 --> 01:52:34.712]  InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:52:34.712 --> 01:52:36.854]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:52:36.854 --> 01:52:47.941]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[01:53:00.356 --> 01:53:01.357]  Hi there.
[01:53:01.357 --> 01:53:02.878]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:53:02.878 --> 01:53:06.701]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:53:06.701 --> 01:53:15.868]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:53:15.868 --> 01:53:22.553]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:53:22.553 --> 01:53:24.755]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:53:24.755 --> 01:53:29.839]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:53:30.559 --> 01:53:38.504]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:53:38.504 --> 01:53:44.087]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:53:44.087 --> 01:53:50.571]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:53:50.571 --> 01:53:56.294]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:53:56.294 --> 01:53:57.455]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:54:08.749 --> 01:54:10.250]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:13.313]  I'm David Knight and Alex is with me for the next segment.
[01:54:13.313 --> 01:54:19.639]  We're also going to be talking to Jerome Corsi because he's going to flesh in this out about what's going on with the Chinese everywhere.
[01:54:20.404 --> 01:54:28.189]  Clearly there was a link between Harry Reid and his son and the Chinese energy company as well as current solar projects that are underway there.
[01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:30.571]  Well more than a link, I mean that was in the news two years ago.
[01:54:30.571 --> 01:54:32.432]  We just hadn't realized it was that land.
[01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:36.475]  Specifically mentioning that land as essentially their mitigation area.
[01:54:36.475 --> 01:54:37.516]  You gotta get rid of Bundy.
[01:54:37.516 --> 01:54:37.976]  Exactly.
[01:54:37.976 --> 01:54:39.157]  Because the cows will get into the...
[01:54:40.526 --> 01:54:41.467]  In the electrical stuff.
[01:54:41.467 --> 01:54:43.728]  I tell you Alex, I wish you could have been there.
[01:54:43.728 --> 01:54:45.149]  I know you would have loved to have been there.
[01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:47.731]  It was just amazing to see that victory.
[01:54:47.731 --> 01:54:53.194]  See people walking up there, standing down, the men with guns pointed at us.
[01:54:53.194 --> 01:54:55.956]  Well if I was you, I would have Corsi on for say 30 minutes.
[01:54:56.676 --> 01:54:58.077]  Then he wants to write Shotgun, that's fine.
[01:54:58.077 --> 01:55:00.339]  I would do 30 minutes of calls from folks to get their take on this.
[01:55:00.339 --> 01:55:01.260]  People are really excited.
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:06.424]  You could even do Overdrive if you feel like it today, because this is the time to celebrate and do a fourth hour if you wanted to.
[01:55:06.424 --> 01:55:07.865]  But if not, that's fine.
[01:55:07.865 --> 01:55:11.268]  The Nightly News is coming up tonight, 7 o'clock Central at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:11.268 --> 01:55:13.730]  Look, I'm going to leave it at this.
[01:55:13.730 --> 01:55:22.937]  Tiananmen Square did not go the way the East German collapsed it, or what happened in Ceausescu, or what happened with the Magna Carta.
[01:55:25.154 --> 01:55:29.902]  It went the way that 1775 Lexington Concord did.
[01:55:29.902 --> 01:55:30.744]  With violence.
[01:55:30.744 --> 01:55:33.449]  But at Lexington Concord we won that battle.
[01:55:33.449 --> 01:55:35.533]  And I have no doubt that if a firefight would have started...
[01:55:36.528 --> 01:55:40.191]  They didn't want... The Globals want to blow something up, then have a firefight start.
[01:55:40.191 --> 01:55:43.433]  Say we blow up a federal building with a daycare center in it.
[01:55:43.433 --> 01:55:44.454]  That's how they're going to do this.
[01:55:44.454 --> 01:55:48.537]  They don't want it out there taking people's land because they can't spend that.
[01:55:48.537 --> 01:55:49.218]  Okay?
[01:55:49.218 --> 01:55:51.099]  I'm not saying the average BLM would be involved in that.
[01:55:51.099 --> 01:55:53.941]  I'm just giving them intel on how the real world works.
[01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:54.261]  Okay?
[01:55:54.261 --> 01:55:56.183]  Now all the false flags are being declassified.
[01:55:56.183 --> 01:55:57.284]  Cy Hirsch is reporting on it.
[01:55:58.064 --> 01:56:00.305]  So, this didn't go the way of Tiananmen Square.
[01:56:00.305 --> 01:56:01.486]  This didn't go the way of Ruby Ridge.
[01:56:01.486 --> 01:56:03.147]  This didn't go the way of Waco.
[01:56:03.147 --> 01:56:04.708]  This went good.
[01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:07.389]  And it was one of the first times we've seen something go well.
[01:56:07.389 --> 01:56:13.173]  And it shows in the minds of the BLM and the establishment, they know they're losing the moral high ground.
[01:56:14.073 --> 01:56:16.275]  Because they're there to clean people off.
[01:56:16.275 --> 01:56:19.257]  This is happening all over the West, and all over the East, and all over the Midwest.
[01:56:19.257 --> 01:56:30.284]  Wherever there is people near national parks or public land, or people that own the land that's inside the national parks that they held on to, they're just locking the gates, not letting them in.
[01:56:30.284 --> 01:56:31.485]  They're harassing them.
[01:56:31.485 --> 01:56:34.087]  This is part of an Agenda 21, get us off the land.
[01:56:35.067 --> 01:56:43.432]  It's about tracking everything you do in commerce while they turn your resources off.
[01:56:43.432 --> 01:56:51.116]  It's about put the Indians on the reservation, put the blacks on the plantation, put the poor white people in the sharecropping operation.
[01:56:51.116 --> 01:56:53.618]  You can only buy your products where?
[01:56:53.618 --> 01:56:54.858]  The company store.
[01:56:54.858 --> 01:56:55.258]  That's right.
[01:56:55.258 --> 01:56:56.539]  Folks should look into that.
[01:56:56.539 --> 01:56:58.000]  This went back to the Romans.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:00.642]  That's why you're always playing Tennessee.
[01:57:00.642 --> 01:57:02.763]  I owe my soul to the company, sure.
[01:57:02.763 --> 01:57:04.544]  Because this is what's happened over and over again.
[01:57:04.544 --> 01:57:06.125]  This is not some new system.
[01:57:06.125 --> 01:57:09.808]  The Republic's new, 235 years old.
[01:57:09.808 --> 01:57:12.029]  Feudalism is 6,000 years old.
[01:57:12.029 --> 01:57:13.170]  That's why we know it.
[01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:14.211]  We know its paradigm.
[01:57:14.211 --> 01:57:15.332]  We know how it works.
[01:57:15.332 --> 01:57:16.232]  We know where it goes.
[01:57:16.232 --> 01:57:17.613]  We know how to beat it.
[01:57:17.613 --> 01:57:21.316]  And this, what you saw, you've duplicated and we own this victory.
[01:57:21.316 --> 01:57:25.378]  And don't let the COINTELPRO disinfo it and, oh, we didn't win anything, they'll be back.
[01:57:25.378 --> 01:57:26.199]  Of course they'll be back.
[01:57:26.519 --> 01:57:29.103]  We rediscover our fighting spirit.
[01:57:29.103 --> 01:57:29.904]  That's how we win.
[01:57:29.904 --> 01:57:31.887]  Now listen, I'm going to turn things over to you.
[01:57:31.887 --> 01:57:35.152]  Incredible job, you and Josh, everybody, and your great wife.
[01:57:35.152 --> 01:57:39.038]  I know, you know, she was right there, you know, watching on the live stream with everything you went through.
[01:57:39.038 --> 01:57:41.682]  So God bless her strength and your great family and the great crew.
[01:57:42.583 --> 01:57:45.424]  We've done two hours now, and we've not plugged one thing on air.
[01:57:45.424 --> 01:57:46.584]  Other talk shows do it every hour.
[01:57:46.584 --> 01:57:53.086]  Folks, if you want to see more reporting like this, if you want to see us strong, we're going through a lot here to fund the operation.
[01:57:53.086 --> 01:57:58.587]  Buy the Molon Labe products at MadeIn1776.com and FullWorthStore.com.
[01:57:58.587 --> 01:58:02.768]  Buy the cap that you saw David wearing that got so many comments out there.
[01:58:02.768 --> 01:58:03.808]  Made in America.
[01:58:03.808 --> 01:58:06.689]  It's a 1776 with a little coiled snake on the side.
[01:58:06.689 --> 01:58:08.290]  Get the George Washington belt buckles.
[01:58:08.290 --> 01:58:09.210]  They're almost sold out.
[01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:14.952]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, Madein1776.com.

[01:58:18.314 --> 01:58:19.234]  Spread the info.
[01:58:19.234 --> 01:58:22.836]  It was your internet support that drove this, and Drudge and others.
[01:58:22.836 --> 01:58:25.297]  In an info war, that's the final point.
[01:58:25.297 --> 01:58:27.458]  We defeated the mainstream horror media in this.
[01:58:27.458 --> 01:58:28.698]  We defeated the Globalists.
[01:58:28.698 --> 01:58:30.019]  We defeated George Soros.
[01:58:30.019 --> 01:58:31.319]  We defeated the UN.
[01:58:31.319 --> 01:58:31.920]  We did it.
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:33.761]  It's a blueprint for victory.
[01:58:33.761 --> 01:58:35.161]  So, war bonds.
[01:58:35.161 --> 01:58:36.942]  Buy stuff at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:37.202 --> 01:58:39.225]  We need treasure for this war!
[01:58:39.225 --> 01:58:39.826]  Fill us!
[01:58:39.826 --> 01:58:41.548]  Give us the weapons we need!
[01:58:41.548 --> 01:58:43.351]  Give it to us!
[01:58:43.351 --> 01:58:44.833]  And your prayers, and your prayers!
[01:58:50.523 --> 01:59:01.206]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:59:01.206 --> 01:59:03.266]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:59:03.266 --> 01:59:04.147]  Fluoride.
[01:59:04.147 --> 01:59:06.067]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:59:06.067 --> 01:59:12.369]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:17.555]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:59:17.555 --> 01:59:23.881]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:59:23.881 --> 01:59:26.304]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:59:26.304 --> 01:59:29.247]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:59:29.247 --> 01:59:32.611]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:59:32.731 --> 01:59:37.792]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:10.232]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.232 --> 02:00:11.813]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.813 --> 02:00:13.373]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.373 --> 02:00:17.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.555 --> 02:00:21.636]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.813 --> 02:00:29.235]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:29.235 --> 02:00:30.697]  I'm David Knight.
[02:00:30.697 --> 02:00:33.240]  We're going to be joined in the next segment with Jerome Corsi.
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:34.943]  He's going to broaden this out.
[02:00:34.943 --> 02:00:38.307]  We're going to see many places where the Chinese are coming in.
[02:00:39.423 --> 02:00:50.088]  In his research, he's pointed out that this is just part of an evolving proposal that Beijing is developing quietly since 2009 to convert more than $1 trillion of U.S.
[02:00:50.088 --> 02:00:52.370]  debt it owns into equity.
[02:00:52.370 --> 02:01:00.874]  Now, of course, Harry Reid's connections to this project, his connections to First Solar, it's crony capitalism.
[02:01:01.494 --> 02:01:16.483]  It's taking ownership of everything and away from the people, running the small businesses down, shutting them down and turning it over to globalist corporations or to the Chinese corporations, which are basically the Chinese government that owns our debt.
[02:01:16.483 --> 02:01:18.665]  So we're going to be talking to Jerome Corsi.
[02:01:18.665 --> 02:01:20.246]  He's going to broaden this out.
[02:01:20.246 --> 02:01:22.007]  It's not just in this area.
[02:01:22.007 --> 02:01:30.012]  They also have Chinese government backed economists that are proposing a plan to allow Chinese corporations to set up development zones.
[02:01:30.592 --> 02:01:38.922]  They're going to create entire cities in America where they send in Chinese businesses and Chinese factories to set things up.
[02:01:38.922 --> 02:01:40.884]  This is what's going on across the country.
[02:01:40.884 --> 02:01:43.106]  But there's another story here as well.
[02:01:43.106 --> 02:01:47.472]  And that is the growing, gradual encroachment and infringement of our rights
[02:01:48.496 --> 02:01:52.918]  Gradually moving onto our property, just like somebody moving their fence onto your property.
[02:01:52.918 --> 02:02:01.242]  You know, they mentioned that specifically in the Second Amendment because they knew that they weren't going to just come in and take away our right to keep and bear arms with just one fiat.
[02:02:01.242 --> 02:02:04.304]  It was going to be a gradual encroachment process.
[02:02:04.304 --> 02:02:08.546]  And we've seen that over and over again from these regulatory agencies like the BLM.
[02:02:09.426 --> 02:02:13.492]  That essentially start to regulate without representation.
[02:02:13.492 --> 02:02:16.235]  That's a key feature of this story.
[02:02:16.235 --> 02:02:25.067]  But the most key feature about this is we know that this is not the end of the war, but this was a victory in a very important battle.
[02:02:25.948 --> 02:02:34.612]  It's a battle that can wake people up, not only to what's going on with Agenda 21 and other issues, but it also wakes people up to see how they can stand this down.
[02:02:34.612 --> 02:02:41.234]  And we're not going to be able to get a mass of people to every place where the government is taking people's businesses or taking their property.
[02:02:41.234 --> 02:02:44.355]  Because you know where they're taking people's businesses for the most part?
[02:02:44.355 --> 02:02:47.177]  It's with things like Obamacare, using the IRS,
[02:02:48.632 --> 02:02:58.376]  Just because the government says that they can do something and gets a court judge to order this, doesn't mean that it is constitutional, doesn't mean that it is lawful.
[02:02:58.376 --> 02:03:10.241]  And yet, just as we saw with a court case back in November, where the IRS was filling out the form for a lady and telling her that if she did not sign it, they were going to hold her in contempt, they were going to send her to jail.
[02:03:10.241 --> 02:03:15.724]  She had zero taxes owed, but it was about their power to force her to do whatever she wanted.
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:17.980]  How did that end?
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:19.981]  That didn't end with a mob of people.
[02:03:19.981 --> 02:03:25.542]  That ended with one person on a jury standing up for what is just.
[02:03:25.542 --> 02:03:37.766]  We need to understand that there are principles that are higher than the declared laws, especially if there are laws and regulations that are put in place by people that we don't even have a say so, that we don't even get a chance to vote in or vote out.
[02:03:38.939 --> 02:03:59.924]  If we're going to have regulation without representation, we as a people need to understand that we do have a place, even if we can't elect someone who will roll this back, even if we've got an opposition party who is just as much in bed with the corporatists that are setting up Obamacare and the massive transfer of wealth from all businesses to insurance companies.
[02:03:59.924 --> 02:04:02.265]  They're putting out not just ranchers out of business.
[02:04:02.785 --> 02:04:16.751]  They're putting out a lot of small businesses because of Obamacare, because of the increased expenses, increased regulations, codes that are being put in place by larger corporations so they can force their smaller competitors out of business.
[02:04:16.751 --> 02:04:18.151]  This is happening everywhere.
[02:04:18.151 --> 02:04:28.396]  When this happens in your community, people need to stand up for a jury trial and the jurors on those trials need to look at what is justice, not what is the law.
[02:04:29.318 --> 02:04:36.981]  Not just to take the orders of a judge, it only takes one person on a jury to stand up to nullify a law.
[02:04:36.981 --> 02:04:40.702]  That's only 8% of the population approximately, about 1 out of 12.
[02:04:40.702 --> 02:04:49.985]  If we can get that many people awake, that many people to stand with those who refuse to obey unlawful orders, we will take this country back.
[02:04:50.305 --> 02:04:51.466]  Now we're going to be right back after the break.
[02:04:51.466 --> 02:04:56.532]  We're going to talk to Dr. Jerome Corsi about how the Chinese are taking over this country.
[02:04:56.532 --> 02:05:00.237]  The massive crony corporatism that's not just in Nevada with Harry Reid.
[02:05:00.876 --> 02:05:08.984]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[02:05:08.984 --> 02:05:11.226]  All the major networks are state-run.
[02:05:11.226 --> 02:05:13.929]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[02:05:13.929 --> 02:05:18.353]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[02:05:18.353 --> 02:05:21.476]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[02:05:21.476 --> 02:05:28.987]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:05:28.987 --> 02:05:33.293]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[02:05:33.293 --> 02:05:35.095]  We are the true media.
[02:05:35.095 --> 02:05:37.699]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[02:05:37.759 --> 02:05:41.522]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[02:06:00.785 --> 02:06:04.828]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:06:04.828 --> 02:06:09.211]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:06:09.211 --> 02:06:12.874]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:06:12.874 --> 02:06:15.896]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:06:15.896 --> 02:06:23.262]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:06:23.482 --> 02:06:27.386]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:06:27.386 --> 02:06:31.810]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:06:31.810 --> 02:06:37.815]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:06:37.815 --> 02:06:41.718]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:06:41.718 --> 02:06:44.461]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:06:44.461 --> 02:06:45.822]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:06:45.962 --> 02:06:47.323]  It's time to take action.
[02:06:47.323 --> 02:06:49.144]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:07:00.833 --> 02:07:05.556]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[02:07:05.556 --> 02:07:06.757]  Why do we have the highest
[02:07:06.817 --> 02:07:14.220]  The highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:16.160]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:17.801]  We are what we eat.
[02:07:17.801 --> 02:07:22.463]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:07:22.463 --> 02:07:26.684]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:07:26.684 --> 02:07:29.245]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:07:29.245 --> 02:07:35.147]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:08:08.018 --> 02:08:14.252]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:20.921]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:20.921 --> 02:08:22.042]  I'm David Knight.
[02:08:22.042 --> 02:08:35.954]  I just got back with Josh Owens from the standoff in Bunkerville, Nevada with the Bundy Ranch and the BLM, who basically turned the area into martial law after a 20-year dispute over what could legally be done there.
[02:08:35.954 --> 02:08:45.442]  Over a 20-year dispute about trying to shut the ranchers completely out of the area that they had enjoyed for generations, asserting that it was for the behalf of the desert tortoise.
[02:08:45.442 --> 02:08:47.524]  That was an obvious pretense.
[02:08:49.025 --> 02:08:56.727]  At the same time, they're mounting a multi-million dollar operation, a militarized operation against this family.
[02:08:56.727 --> 02:09:04.568]  They're allowing turtles, they're actually not allowing, they are euthanizing turtles under their care, more than 1,400 turtles under their care.
[02:09:04.568 --> 02:09:11.350]  And of course, they were able to drive out 52 of the 53 ranchers in that area with their regulations.
[02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:22.117]  Coming in and saying, you are now only going to be allowed to have 10% of the stock that you used to have before and you're not going to be able to put your stock on the land in the prime part of the season.
[02:09:22.117 --> 02:09:23.699]  That's the incrementalism.
[02:09:23.699 --> 02:09:31.884]  That's the way through regulation in these unelected bureaucracies they can regulate any business out of business.
[02:09:31.884 --> 02:09:34.186]  That's what they're doing with Obamacare.
[02:09:34.186 --> 02:09:36.228]  It's essentially the same thing.
[02:09:36.228 --> 02:09:38.249]  Coming in and declaring that they have the right to
[02:09:39.810 --> 02:09:42.492]  To assume new powers that are not in the Constitution.
[02:09:42.492 --> 02:09:46.254]  The 9th and 10th Amendments say if it's not explicitly in there, you don't have that right.
[02:09:46.254 --> 02:09:55.180]  They don't have the right to force people to buy Obamacare, to buy insurance, to spend much more than they ever would on an insurance policy.
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:10:05.906]  Forcing single men to buy maternity policies so that they can transfer excessive amounts of money to the insurance companies that gave them money to run for office.
[02:10:05.906 --> 02:10:07.527]  So what we're seeing here is crony capitalism.
[02:10:07.527 --> 02:10:08.268]  When reported this,
[02:10:09.028 --> 02:10:17.770]  This was really the thing, I believe, that that drive this dramatic turnaround that we saw between Friday afternoon, late Friday afternoon, and early Friday morning.
[02:10:17.770 --> 02:10:25.051]  By Friday morning, the sheriff was there with a BLM press release in hand saying, we're going to allow you, we're going to open up the land again for your cattle.
[02:10:25.051 --> 02:10:31.213]  Of course, they had his cattle, a lot of his cattle they had already seized and they were subsequently taken back.
[02:10:31.213 --> 02:10:33.693]  But listen to this article that came out today from the Washington Times.
[02:10:33.693 --> 02:10:37.154]  They said, it was likely that pressure from upstairs, that would be Harry Reid,
[02:10:37.834 --> 02:10:42.556]  Rather than weapons from the field that changed his mind on the matter.
[02:10:42.556 --> 02:10:44.177]  Who is he that changed his mind?
[02:10:44.177 --> 02:10:51.500]  That would be the director of the BLM, the guy who used to be Harry Reid's senior policy advisor, Neil Corns.
[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:53.060]  He is now the head of the BLM.
[02:10:53.060 --> 02:11:03.665]  That's right, the guy who used to work for Harry Reid is head of the BLM and they were specifically targeting the Bundy Ranch and Kit Daniels found that documentation specifically targeting them.
[02:11:04.741 --> 02:11:05.021]  Yes.
[02:11:20.126 --> 02:11:21.167]  Before in the past.
[02:11:21.167 --> 02:11:22.749]  It's not to say that it is completely dead.
[02:11:22.749 --> 02:11:26.433]  I've got on the phone right now, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:11:26.433 --> 02:11:31.359]  And at WND, he wrote an article about where the Chinese are going with this.
[02:11:31.359 --> 02:11:34.182]  They're not just in that one area with Harry Reid.
[02:11:34.182 --> 02:11:35.143]  This is massive.
[02:11:35.143 --> 02:11:37.305]  This is across the country.
[02:11:37.305 --> 02:11:39.047]  Dr. Corsi, thank you for joining us.
[02:11:39.047 --> 02:11:39.828]  My great pleasure.
[02:11:39.828 --> 02:11:40.169]  Thank you.
[02:11:40.836 --> 02:12:00.329]  Now, in April, in your article, you say that Bloomberg reported that a Chinese billionaire, who was the founder of E.N.N., the energy group that wanted to put this solar project there, had teamed up with Harry Reid to get incentives, including land that was 113 miles south of Las Vegas, and they sought to buy $4.5 million, less than one-eighth of the land's 38
[02:12:01.710 --> 02:12:03.991]  Well, yes, I mean, I've been writing about this now for several years.
[02:12:03.991 --> 02:12:06.611]  I mean, especially under the Obama administration, it's really picked up.
[02:12:06.611 --> 02:12:07.972]  The Chinese, working largely with Harry Reid,
[02:12:29.648 --> 02:12:30.068]  Have you?
[02:12:45.896 --> 02:12:53.839]  Because it was viewed to be not in our national security interest to allow major energy or transportation facilities to be owned by the Chinese.
[02:12:53.839 --> 02:12:55.859]  Well, the Obama administration has reversed that.
[02:12:55.859 --> 02:13:04.322]  Of course, we continue to borrow a trillion dollars from the Chinese, and the interest on that alone is mounting daily.
[02:13:04.322 --> 02:13:10.444]  And the Obama administration shows no end of interest in running deficits and borrowing from the Chinese.
[02:13:11.624 --> 02:13:19.228]  Here runs Harry Reid in 2011 with a group of Senators on a Senate-funded trip to China.
[02:13:19.228 --> 02:13:24.530]  And Harry Reid comes back with this partnership with E.N.N.
[02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:26.131]  Energy, E.N.N.
[02:13:26.131 --> 02:13:31.374]  Group, which is one of the largest energy companies in China, 100% owned by the Chinese.
[02:13:31.374 --> 02:13:32.954]  Yeah, Chinese government, yeah.
[02:13:32.954 --> 02:13:37.276]  Chinese government, and partnering with the E.N.N.
[02:13:37.276 --> 02:13:38.237]  to bring E.N.
[02:13:38.237 --> 02:13:39.658]  to shut down coal plants
[02:13:40.538 --> 02:13:40.698]  Yeah.
[02:13:59.022 --> 02:14:10.345]  A solar power funded by the Chinese, you of course got to throw ranchers off their land and you have to exclude any coal powered plants which are cheaper.
[02:14:10.345 --> 02:14:10.565]  Yeah.
[02:14:10.565 --> 02:14:11.825]  And more effective.
[02:14:11.825 --> 02:14:21.627]  Well of course they had rights just like property owners have rights and they've got to somehow get them off of the land before they can turn an area over to a developer to build a skyscraper in a city.
[02:14:21.627 --> 02:14:24.288]  It was the same sort of thing that was happening here with these ranchers.
[02:14:24.708 --> 02:14:32.694]  And I think the showdown ended when it became clear that, I mean, you were reporting at InfoWorld, we're reporting at WND.com.
[02:14:32.694 --> 02:14:39.059]  The Harry Reid connection here is Harry Reid is about as corrupt as they come.
[02:14:39.059 --> 02:14:43.323]  He's put his son in his lawyer for ENN group.
[02:14:43.323 --> 02:14:50.448]  He's pressured EN Energy, which is a utility providing electricity in Nevada, to take more
[02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:54.312]  That's why the original Chinese plan to buy these 9,000 acres has failed.
[02:14:54.312 --> 02:14:55.593]  At least failed this round.
[02:14:55.593 --> 02:14:57.574]  Harry Reid will revive it again.
[02:15:08.143 --> 02:15:11.925]  Kerry Reid never gives up on these plans.
[02:15:11.925 --> 02:15:16.927]  Just because the Bundy Ranch won today, doesn't mean BLM is going away.
[02:15:25.491 --> 02:15:37.460]  A cop advisor to Harry Reid has spent the last few years in BLM doing a six-state study in the Southwest of how to convert huge areas of the Southwest to solar farms.
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:47.208]  And again, they're not worried in moving the endangered species to another habitat, which they call mitigation of the effects.
[02:15:48.128 --> 02:15:49.769]  The environmentalists are happy to do that.
[02:15:49.769 --> 02:16:00.853]  If it's to build a solar farm owned by the Chinese, they just won't move this tortoise if it's to the benefit of a rancher who wants to graze cattle.
[02:16:00.853 --> 02:16:01.533]  That's right.
[02:16:01.533 --> 02:16:04.274]  They've done that over and over again all around the area of Las Vegas.
[02:16:04.274 --> 02:16:10.997]  They've moved tortoises out, they got money from developers there and said, that's fine, you pay us money, we don't really care about the tortoises.
[02:16:11.317 --> 02:16:13.198]  Yeah, the tortoises are just a chip in the game.
[02:16:13.198 --> 02:16:14.579]  That's right.
[02:16:14.579 --> 02:16:17.001]  The left and the environmentalists don't care about the tortoises.
[02:16:17.001 --> 02:16:28.448]  It's just a way of using the BLM and the EPA to impose this ideological agenda against carbon fuels, which is absolutely an irrational agenda.
[02:16:29.108 --> 02:16:42.557]  I mean, it's, you know, again, you see it in the hysteria over the UN's Climate Commission coming out again and saying all these disastrous consequences are going to happen because we burn carbon-based fuels.
[02:16:42.557 --> 02:16:44.979]  Carbon-based fuels are perfectly natural.
[02:16:44.979 --> 02:16:45.939]  They're a product of the earth.
[02:16:45.939 --> 02:16:48.041]  They can be burned in a clean fashion.
[02:16:48.041 --> 02:16:49.722]  They have nothing to do with dinosaurs.
[02:16:49.722 --> 02:16:50.483]  More lies.
[02:16:51.243 --> 02:17:06.486]  But the left, the Democratic Party, the radical core of the Democratic Party, Al Gore through Harry Reid, have found a way to make billions of dollars personally, millions, by scamming the American people into this climate hysteria.
[02:17:07.307 --> 02:17:22.426]  Thinking the carbon fuels are bad, in the meantime inviting the Chinese to come in here and build billions of dollars taking land away from ranchers in order to let the Chinese run solar energy farms, which are not productive, not economically
[02:17:23.127 --> 02:17:23.607]  No, it's not.
[02:17:42.125 --> 02:17:55.185]  But yet in Harry Reid's agenda, that narrative is important for Harry Reid and his Democratic crony corrupted buddies in Congress to become millionaires and billionaires just like Al Gore did.
[02:17:55.185 --> 02:17:55.685]  Exactly.
[02:17:55.685 --> 02:17:57.488]  You know, it's not just about
[02:17:58.519 --> 02:18:07.663]  China now, as you pointed out, WND has reliable information that the Bank of China has continued to advance plans to convert China's holdings of U.S.
[02:18:07.663 --> 02:18:08.763]  debt into equity.
[02:18:08.763 --> 02:18:13.105]  That's what we see happening with China, but of course it's not just even with China.
[02:18:13.105 --> 02:18:14.565]  This is crony capitalism.
[02:18:14.565 --> 02:18:18.067]  This is where giant corporations come in, buy special favors,
[02:18:18.627 --> 02:18:22.169]  Get the government to run out by regulation all of the small businesses.
[02:18:22.169 --> 02:18:46.823]  We've seen this pattern happen over and over again in many different industries, but what's happening here is that Harry Reid has put his minion, the guy who used to be a senior policy advisor to him, in as head of the Bureau of Land Management, which they now see, I guess, as the Bureau of Land Ownership, and they are now trading these mineral rights that they find throughout all this property, the water rights, the surface rights, they're trading those all off to their
[02:18:47.403 --> 02:18:53.869]  They're giant corporations, and of course then getting massive campaign contributions from those same corporations.
[02:18:53.869 --> 02:18:59.874]  That was what caused them to back down, was shining the light on these cockroaches, wasn't it?
[02:18:59.874 --> 02:19:02.676]  Yeah, and look, I'm sure it was Harry Reid that caused the back down.
[02:19:02.676 --> 02:19:05.539]  Harry Reid doesn't want this being brought to light.
[02:19:05.539 --> 02:19:13.105]  I mean, but look, the Democrats, Obama, the corruption within the Obama administration is enormous when it comes to energy.
[02:19:13.105 --> 02:19:14.626]  Again, remember, it was the
[02:19:15.467 --> 02:19:28.535]  All these Solyndras, these, you know, billion dollars that were funded by Obama in the stimulus bill all went to bundlers, you know, Obama supporters and funders.
[02:19:28.535 --> 02:19:32.637]  Money slipped under the table, campaign contributions to Democrats.
[02:19:32.637 --> 02:19:44.324]  And what happened is that all these solar panel Democrat funded firms went bankrupt because the Chinese undercut them in producing solar panels on the world market.
[02:19:44.864 --> 02:19:45.605]  That's right.
[02:19:45.605 --> 02:19:47.066]  Which was inevitable.
[02:19:47.066 --> 02:19:48.287]  Hang on right there, Dr. Corsi.
[02:19:48.287 --> 02:19:50.029]  We're going to be right back.
[02:19:50.029 --> 02:19:51.770]  Dr. Jerome Corsi from WND.

[02:19:59.637 --> 02:20:00.258]  We'll be right back.

[02:21:00.234 --> 02:21:10.882]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:21:10.882 --> 02:21:12.704]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:21:12.904 --> 02:21:13.785]  Fluoride.
[02:21:13.785 --> 02:21:15.686]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:21:15.686 --> 02:21:22.230]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:27.133]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:21:27.133 --> 02:21:33.417]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:21:33.417 --> 02:21:35.818]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:21:35.818 --> 02:21:38.720]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:42.102]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:21:42.202 --> 02:21:47.246]  You'll find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:21:47.246 --> 02:21:52.670]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:22:00.458 --> 02:22:06.241]  What I'm about to tell you is based on information obtained from a little-known government document called FT-900.
[02:22:06.241 --> 02:22:10.643]  This bombshell government document contains evidence on what I believe will cause the next 9-11.
[02:22:10.643 --> 02:22:23.490]  I've just posted a video at www.next911exposed2.com that not only analyzes the contents of this document, but it walks you through the exact timeline of how and when this 9-11 event is scheduled to occur.
[02:22:24.170 --> 02:22:29.214]  Just like 9-11 had a lasting impact on our society, this event will reshape America.
[02:22:29.214 --> 02:22:36.459]  It will swipe trillions off markets and retirement accounts everywhere and destroy the way of life of millions of unprepared Americans.
[02:22:36.459 --> 02:22:41.803]  But it will also trigger what promises to be the biggest wealth transfer in the history of our nation.
[02:22:41.803 --> 02:22:47.427]  But you only have a few weeks left to take all the necessary steps to protect yourself and your family.

[02:24:18.482 --> 02:24:19.982]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:19.982 --> 02:24:25.284]  I'm David Knight, and I have Dr. Jerome Korzy from WND on the phone.
[02:24:25.284 --> 02:24:30.006]  Now, he's written extensively about China playing their debt card.
[02:24:30.006 --> 02:24:35.287]  This is an article from January 20th, 2013, a little over a year ago.
[02:24:35.287 --> 02:24:38.308]  He said, China poised to play the debt card for U.S.
[02:24:38.308 --> 02:24:39.209]  land.
[02:24:39.209 --> 02:24:42.830]  We've seen how that plays out in places like Nevada.
[02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:49.974]  Where we shined the spotlight on the dirty dealings of Harry Reid, and they backed down.
[02:24:49.974 --> 02:24:53.416]  That's not us saying that, that's the Americans Against the Tea Party saying that.
[02:24:53.416 --> 02:25:00.321]  They said it was likely pressure from upstairs, in other words, Harry Reid, rather than weapons from the field that changed his mind on the matter.
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:15.895]  And of course, the person who made that declaration, who backed him down, was the very head of the BLM, his former, Harry Reid's former minion, still his minion, but his former senior policy advisor, that would be Neil Korns, who is now the head of the BLM.
[02:25:15.895 --> 02:25:18.237]  But we wanted Dr. Jerome Corzine to get on and
[02:25:19.218 --> 02:25:43.002]  Flush this out for us, because this is a project, it's not for sure that they are not going to come back and get involved in this project, but we also have seen First Solar breaking ground, and this was also involving the Bundy Ranch, because they saw the Bundy Ranch in the Gold Butte area, where their cows were grazing, as a quote-unquote mitigation area, essentially a carbon credit, if you will.
[02:25:44.110 --> 02:25:51.014]  Keeping that area pristine, getting the cattle off, abrogating his rights so they could move ahead with these projects.
[02:25:51.014 --> 02:25:56.797]  They all referenced this particular ranch, this rancher who's the last man standing for 20 years.
[02:25:56.797 --> 02:26:00.560]  They needed to get his rights, his grazing rights, his water rights out of the way.
[02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:04.443]  So they can move ahead with these crony capitalist projects.
[02:26:04.443 --> 02:26:06.945]  One of them is going, the other ones will be going as well.
[02:26:06.945 --> 02:26:09.747]  They have many projects there, but it's all over the country.
[02:26:09.747 --> 02:26:16.973]  Dr. Jerome Corzi, we were just talking about what's going on with China, this debt card where we're transferring control of U.S.
[02:26:16.973 --> 02:26:17.894]  land, U.S.
[02:26:17.894 --> 02:26:20.456]  assets, and the BLM is a major part of that.
[02:26:21.357 --> 02:26:21.897]  Well, that's right.
[02:26:21.897 --> 02:26:26.859]  I mean, this entire green energy scam, and that's really what it is.
[02:26:26.859 --> 02:26:41.765]  I mean, for decades now, the far left has tried to push this agenda on America in its antipathy to carbon fuels, thinking we're going to destroy the world if carbon fuels are burned, which is nonsense.
[02:26:41.765 --> 02:26:49.709]  Or the fossil fuels, they're not fossil fuels, they're naturally produced by the earth on an ongoing basis, been burned for thousands of years, and we're still here.
[02:26:50.769 --> 02:26:55.131]  But yet, if you can get solar panels, you can accomplish several goals.
[02:26:55.131 --> 02:26:56.532]  The far left wants to do it.
[02:26:56.532 --> 02:27:02.395]  Can they get an Agenda 21 grab of getting any independent ranchers off of land?
[02:27:02.395 --> 02:27:10.239]  It can move the Chinese in, which, of course, the Democratic politicians are happy to receive campaign contributions and kickbacks.
[02:27:10.239 --> 02:27:17.042]  Remember, it goes back to Clinton and all of his Chinese buddies and Al Gore being run under the table.
[02:27:18.383 --> 02:27:21.606]  So now you've got the, you know, Harry Reid playing the game.
[02:27:21.606 --> 02:27:34.419]  And Harry Reid in Nevada has been waging a war since about 2005 against any carbon-producing power plants, which are cheaper, more efficient, better for the consumer in Nevada.
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:35.660]  The Chinese undercut
[02:27:59.790 --> 02:28:17.366]  Effort number one by the Obama corrupt gang, which was Solyndra and the other bogus solar corporations that were funded with billions of dollars in stimulus money, went bankrupt when the Chinese inevitably produced cheaper solar panels on the international market.
[02:28:18.027 --> 02:28:32.740]  Now the Chinese want to come into the United States and dominate the energy market with, again, the scam of taking huge quantities, because it takes massive amounts of land for these solar plants to be able to produce energy.
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:37.264]  And then they don't work, because even in Nevada, the sun doesn't shine all the time.
[02:28:37.264 --> 02:28:38.425]  They're highly inefficient.
[02:28:39.065 --> 02:28:53.255]  Country after country around the world has shown that they cost more to produce these solar and wind facilities online with backup hydro power generation when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.
[02:28:53.255 --> 02:28:56.797]  It's all a scam, but Harry Rich can get rich at it.
[02:28:56.797 --> 02:28:59.379]  Harry Reid can make sure he lines his pocket.
[02:28:59.379 --> 02:29:02.361]  Alan Gore became a billionaire on this nonsense.
[02:29:03.161 --> 02:29:30.179]  And the left has an ideological agenda which, you know, again goes back to the left even wanting to control the this whole carbon tax scheme that they were going to impose on us until all the fraudulent emails got disclosed from the EU showing the climate science underlying all this renewable energy nonsense is largely fabricated junk science made up by fraudulent scientists and universities left oriented often paid to do it.
[02:29:30.179 --> 02:29:31.060]  Absolutely right.
[02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:32.481]  Thank you, Dr. Jerome Corsi for
[02:29:33.101 --> 02:29:38.246]  Exposing the light on these plans, on the graft and corruption that we see happening here.
[02:29:38.246 --> 02:29:41.649]  This is across the country and people need to wake up to it.
[02:29:41.649 --> 02:29:42.730]  It makes a difference.
[02:29:42.730 --> 02:29:43.491]  It backs them down.
[02:29:43.491 --> 02:29:47.154]  Thank you so much for reporting on what's going on with the Chinese and Harry Reid.
[02:29:47.154 --> 02:29:49.656]  That's Dr. Jerome Corsi, WND.
[02:29:49.656 --> 02:29:51.058]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.058 --> 02:29:53.580]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.580 --> 02:29:56.262]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.799 --> 02:30:03.640]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:08.763]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:30:08.763 --> 02:30:16.586]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:30:16.886 --> 02:30:21.407]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:30:21.407 --> 02:30:25.389]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:30:25.389 --> 02:30:31.330]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:30:31.330 --> 02:30:34.491]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:30:34.491 --> 02:30:39.653]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:30:39.873 --> 02:30:48.017]  Go to MyPatriotsSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[02:31:00.482 --> 02:31:03.545]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:03.545 --> 02:31:05.687]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[02:31:05.687 --> 02:31:11.872]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[02:31:11.872 --> 02:31:16.956]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[02:31:16.956 --> 02:31:21.840]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:26.344]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:35.249]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:31:35.249 --> 02:31:37.390]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[02:31:37.390 --> 02:31:50.298]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage.

[02:32:15.009 --> 02:32:31.071]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:32:31.331 --> 02:32:39.358]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:32:39.358 --> 02:32:45.703]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:32:58.633 --> 02:32:59.474]  InfoWarsLife.com
[02:33:01.647 --> 02:33:02.488]  Excuse me?
[02:33:02.488 --> 02:33:04.871]  This is an emergency transmit.
[02:33:04.871 --> 02:33:10.217]  This is an emergency transmit.
[02:33:10.217 --> 02:33:15.322]  From FEMA Region 6.
[02:33:25.578 --> 02:33:27.239]  There is a war.
[02:33:27.239 --> 02:33:29.139]  It's happening now.
[02:33:29.139 --> 02:33:31.520]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:34.081]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:33:34.081 --> 02:33:36.002]  We are the resistance.
[02:33:36.002 --> 02:33:37.663]  We are the InfoWar.
[02:33:43.385 --> 02:33:44.726]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:44.726 --> 02:33:48.667]  I'm David Knight and we just were talking to Dr. Jerome Corsi from WND.
[02:33:48.667 --> 02:34:05.253]  He was fleshing out this Chinese takeover, this debt that is being converted to land and resources, how the Obama administration is taking down barriers that had been up against strategic infrastructure, allowing that to be sold to the Chinese.
[02:34:05.253 --> 02:34:09.875]  Just as we see foreign countries owning toll roads throughout America, we're now seeing
[02:34:11.035 --> 02:34:15.518]  Harry Reid and others trying to turn over our energy grid to foreign countries.
[02:34:15.518 --> 02:34:22.042]  And one of the ways that they're trying to do this is with these giant solar power projects out in Nevada.
[02:34:22.042 --> 02:34:33.369]  And of course, as Kit Daniels and InfoWars broke last week, it was the number one story, they pointed out that this was about the Bundy Ranch specifically mentioned in these documents.
[02:34:33.369 --> 02:34:37.512]  Of course, others have pushed back against that and said, well, no, that wasn't in the same area.
[02:34:38.396 --> 02:34:46.421]  The Bundy Ranch was to be used as a mitigation area for all these solar projects that were set up.
[02:34:46.421 --> 02:34:56.166]  The two that were set up for First Solar, that is also, although it's not the Chinese, Harry Reid was still very much involved in that, but also for the E&N project.
[02:34:56.326 --> 02:35:03.190]  And as Dr. Jerome Corsi pointed out, ENN has had very close ties to Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:09.113]  It's a company, an energy company, the largest Chinese energy company owned by the Chinese government.
[02:35:09.113 --> 02:35:11.474]  Now we're going to take your calls on this.
[02:35:11.474 --> 02:35:11.915]  We want to
[02:35:12.495 --> 02:35:18.659]  Have you call in with questions or comments about what you've seen, about the larger issues involved here, about the victory that we saw there.
[02:35:18.659 --> 02:35:21.300]  And of course, the war is not over.
[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:22.461]  It was a battle.
[02:35:22.461 --> 02:35:23.281]  But it was a victory.
[02:35:23.281 --> 02:35:24.342]  I think we need to take that.
[02:35:24.342 --> 02:35:29.365]  We need not be afraid of the fact that, well, maybe this was a feint by the feds or whatever.
[02:35:29.365 --> 02:35:32.507]  Look, they were not expecting this.
[02:35:32.507 --> 02:35:34.828]  Josh and I were just talking about that earlier.
[02:35:34.828 --> 02:35:37.030]  It completely took them by surprise.
[02:35:37.890 --> 02:35:42.251]  They were reacting, first of all, to the story that came out last week, and that's not just us saying that.
[02:35:42.251 --> 02:35:52.693]  That's the Americans Against the Tea Party, quoted by Washington Times earlier today, said, it was a likely pressure from upstairs rather than weapons from the field that changed his mind on the matter.
[02:35:52.693 --> 02:36:00.435]  Fact is, Harry Reid probably didn't want his name attached to the biggest civilian massacre in US history right before the election season.
[02:36:00.435 --> 02:36:01.575]  So we're going to take your calls on that.
[02:36:01.575 --> 02:36:01.815]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:36:05.416 --> 02:36:06.397]  That pushed them back.
[02:36:06.397 --> 02:36:19.586]  That exposed the corruption, the graft, the connections between his son, who was a lobbyist for the solar industry, as well as his former senior policy advisor, who is now head of the BLM, that's Neil Corns.
[02:36:19.586 --> 02:36:21.187]  He's the one who backed it down.
[02:36:21.187 --> 02:36:25.009]  He's the one who gave the order to step this down.
[02:36:25.009 --> 02:36:28.732]  And that happened very suddenly, as I was talking about before.
[02:36:28.732 --> 02:36:34.776]  On Friday afternoon, as we were headed down to Nevada to confront the Sheriff's Department down there,
[02:36:36.092 --> 02:36:42.895]  We saw and did a report about the fact that they had taken down signs about the cattle area at that moment.
[02:36:42.895 --> 02:36:46.537]  So they were still moving ahead on Friday afternoon with their plans.
[02:36:46.537 --> 02:36:58.963]  This story came out, we went down there, we told the sheriff about it, we called up a press release that the BLM was having, essentially asked a rhetorical question about the corruption, about the connections with Harry Reid to this.
[02:36:58.963 --> 02:37:02.385]  Of course, we didn't expect them to comment on it, and they didn't comment on it.
[02:37:02.385 --> 02:37:04.826]  We just wanted them to know that we knew.
[02:37:05.626 --> 02:37:09.827]  And it subsequently went to the number one story on Friday.
[02:37:09.827 --> 02:37:19.710]  By the next morning, the sheriff, who would not say anything, did not even have a prepared propaganda statement, the sheriff wanted to meet with Mr. Bundy.
[02:37:19.710 --> 02:37:21.991]  Mr. Bundy said, not in private, we'll do it in public.
[02:37:22.611 --> 02:37:41.379]  You read the BLM press release saying that they were going to allow grazing to happen and Bundy came back and said, I want you to stand down this martial law, essentially talking about the weapons, talking about the checkpoints, talking about the brutality that had been existed there and gave them one hour to do that.
[02:37:41.379 --> 02:37:42.239]  When they didn't do that,
[02:37:43.288 --> 02:37:45.869]  Bundy said, let's go get the cattle.
[02:37:45.869 --> 02:37:55.594]  He's saying, I'm not telling you what to do, it's just the governor and the sheriff that I give orders to because they have a duty to protect the property of the citizens, to protect them from being brutalized.
[02:37:55.594 --> 02:37:57.375]  I asked a state rep when she came there.
[02:37:57.375 --> 02:38:02.197]  She was talking about, well, you know, this really isn't a very cost-effective way to do this, is it?
[02:38:02.197 --> 02:38:08.900]  Because they're spending millions of dollars on this operation and they're not really getting much for their money.
[02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:10.401]  It's very, very inefficient to do this.
[02:38:10.401 --> 02:38:11.842]  You know, it's not about efficiency.
[02:38:13.484 --> 02:38:14.945]  It's about liberty.
[02:38:14.945 --> 02:38:26.115]  I asked her, I said, would it be okay, you know, if it's okay for these guys to create martial law here, would it be okay for the BLM to come into this area and start raping people?
[02:38:26.115 --> 02:38:30.939]  At what point does the local law enforcement, the sheriff, need to stand up and do his duty?
[02:38:31.991 --> 02:38:43.997]  Well, as we were asking these questions again, they came up with their, they reacted to this on Saturday morning, and the crowd went to the area and took back the cattle, empty-handed.
[02:38:43.997 --> 02:38:59.344]  The crowd walked up to the barriers and looked these guys who were hiding behind their vehicles with weapons pointed at us, talking into the PA system, telling us to stand down, they were going to use lethal force, they would shoot, they had a court order, vacate the area or they would shoot
[02:38:59.884 --> 02:39:10.346]  They were stood down by the crowd on foot, the crowd on horseback, peacefully approaching the barriers, just like V for Vendetta, except with cowboys.
[02:39:10.346 --> 02:39:11.607]  It was a great scene.
[02:39:11.607 --> 02:39:14.027]  I tell you what, I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
[02:39:14.027 --> 02:39:16.368]  It's going to be one of the highlights of my life.
[02:39:16.368 --> 02:39:21.349]  So I want to take your calls and see what you think about this, see if you have any comments, see if anybody was there.
[02:39:22.298 --> 02:39:28.082]  But before we do, I want to point out that this half hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by My Patriot Supply.
[02:39:28.082 --> 02:39:33.246]  Now, as we see Agenda 21 being enacted everywhere, we need to understand that patriots need to get prepared.
[02:39:33.246 --> 02:39:37.009]  They're running us off the land, they're taking the property, they're taking the water rights.
[02:39:38.168 --> 02:39:40.729]  You can do that by going to MyPatriotSupply.
[02:39:40.729 --> 02:39:43.210]  They offer high-quality survival gear.
[02:39:43.210 --> 02:39:46.332]  It's the home of the Patriot Pantry line of emergency food storage.
[02:39:46.332 --> 02:39:48.873]  The food is delicious, easy to prepare.
[02:39:48.873 --> 02:39:50.934]  It's put together with GMO-free crops.
[02:39:50.934 --> 02:39:53.495]  It's storable for up to 25 years.
[02:39:53.495 --> 02:40:00.258]  And they've developed space-saving and secure food storage bins, unlike the flimsy plastic pails that you find almost everywhere else.

[02:40:04.260 --> 02:40:07.082]  That's MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:40:07.782 --> 02:40:10.905]  The globalists are counting on you to be unprepared.

[02:40:11.705 --> 02:40:15.648]  Get prepared at mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today.
[02:40:15.648 --> 02:40:17.570]  Let's take some of our calls.
[02:40:17.570 --> 02:40:19.011]  We've got Sean on the line.
[02:40:19.011 --> 02:40:22.714]  Sean, go ahead.
[02:40:22.714 --> 02:40:23.254]  Oh, he did.
[02:40:23.254 --> 02:40:23.595]  Okay.
[02:40:23.595 --> 02:40:25.516]  Who else have we got here?
[02:40:25.516 --> 02:40:27.978]  We've got Sue in Idaho.
[02:40:27.978 --> 02:40:29.639]  Sue, go ahead.
[02:40:29.639 --> 02:40:29.800]  Hello.
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:29.860]  Hi.
[02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:31.481]  How you doing?
[02:40:32.332 --> 02:40:34.714]  Hi, I'm doing very well.
[02:40:34.714 --> 02:40:39.878]  I'm in contact with a gentleman who lives down the road from the Bundy Ranch.
[02:40:39.878 --> 02:40:44.121]  He contacted me on my website this morning, Mountain View Off-Grid Living.
[02:40:44.121 --> 02:40:47.323]  He said that there's something going on down there today.
[02:40:47.323 --> 02:40:51.587]  He tried to drive down the road to see what was going on.
[02:40:51.587 --> 02:40:53.068]  They've got all the roads blocked.
[02:40:53.746 --> 02:41:01.268]  He saw that they brought in a mobile command center, they've got prison buses and a lot of police cars.
[02:41:01.268 --> 02:41:02.688]  Nobody knows what's going on.
[02:41:02.688 --> 02:41:09.730]  He said a lot of the locals are getting spooked and several of them are packing up and leaving the area.
[02:41:09.730 --> 02:41:11.850]  What did he say about the supporters?
[02:41:11.850 --> 02:41:12.930]  What are the crowds like?
[02:41:12.930 --> 02:41:14.831]  Have most of the people left the area now?
[02:41:16.055 --> 02:41:21.782]  He cannot get down the road to find out anything that's going on because they've got the roads blocked.
[02:41:21.782 --> 02:41:27.929]  I thought maybe you guys could check into this, you have a little more context than I do, and see what's going on.
[02:41:27.929 --> 02:41:35.379]  I did send you an email a while ago with a video of the command center and the prison buses coming in.
[02:41:35.845 --> 02:41:41.447]  Well I can tell you what, if they move in there with force, it is going to backfire on them seriously.
[02:41:41.447 --> 02:41:53.050]  Whether or not the people shoot back, whether or not they defend themselves, this is going to be a major public relations fiasco for the government if they come in under martial law and do this.
[02:41:53.050 --> 02:41:55.631]  They have dealt deceitfully with everybody they have.
[02:41:56.351 --> 02:42:01.317]  Trespassed on the rights of this family for a very long time.
[02:42:01.317 --> 02:42:07.064]  If they step this up again this quickly, it's going to be a disaster for the government.
[02:42:07.064 --> 02:42:08.045]  I hope this doesn't happen.
[02:42:08.045 --> 02:42:09.067]  I hope they don't get violent.
[02:42:09.067 --> 02:42:10.028]  Thank you.
[02:42:10.028 --> 02:42:11.229]  Roger Nevada, go ahead.
[02:42:11.229 --> 02:42:13.272]  Do you have any information on what's going on today?
[02:42:14.575 --> 02:42:20.336]  Yes, I just want to say thank you, Mr. Knight, for coming out here to Southern Nevada to help out with the victory.
[02:42:20.336 --> 02:42:23.137]  Also, I encourage all the listeners, okay?
[02:42:23.137 --> 02:42:26.677]  We need to go a step further tomorrow.
[02:42:26.677 --> 02:42:34.039]  I encourage everybody to call up their elected officials, like what I did today, and appeal the 16th Amendment.
[02:42:34.039 --> 02:42:35.859]  Let's go to a national sales tax.
[02:42:35.859 --> 02:42:36.940]  Let's get rid of the IRS.
[02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:39.920]  And also, let's get rid of Obamacare also.
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:42.721]  So we get at least our country halfway back on track.
[02:42:42.721 --> 02:42:43.961]  But we have a lot of homework to do.
[02:42:44.699 --> 02:42:45.780]  Keep up the good work.
[02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:51.104]  I'm telling you, I'm proud of you, Mr. Michael Knight, and also for your boss, Alex Jones.
[02:42:51.104 --> 02:42:54.126]  If it wasn't for your program, I don't know how we could get this country back.
[02:43:01.021 --> 02:43:06.463]  We were laughed at when we said we need to repeal the income tax, we need to get rid of the IRS.
[02:43:06.463 --> 02:43:08.123]  Now we've got Ted Cruz saying that.
[02:43:08.123 --> 02:43:09.704]  We're winning the information war.
[02:43:09.704 --> 02:43:12.625]  People are understanding the corruption of the system.
[02:43:12.625 --> 02:43:21.208]  They're understanding that the government is infringing and encroaching on our rights gradually in areas that they do not have any lawful authority.
[02:43:21.208 --> 02:43:26.270]  And they're starting to understand that they need to judge for themselves, think for themselves,
[02:43:27.270 --> 02:43:33.514]  What does the Constitution say when it clearly says they do not have these rights unless they're explicitly granted to them?
[02:43:33.514 --> 02:43:34.734]  It really means it.
[02:43:34.734 --> 02:43:40.158]  And when they try to do this, they may have a lot of force, they may have a lot of power, they don't have authority.
[02:43:40.158 --> 02:43:43.700]  We need to understand that the government has massive force.
[02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:53.284]  But if we understand that they don't have any authority, that these things are immoral, illegal, then perhaps some good people will stand up as we saw happen in Nevada.
[02:43:53.284 --> 02:43:54.245]  That's what it takes.
[02:43:54.245 --> 02:44:01.588]  It takes people who never thought that their government was capable of doing this, just like the Bundy family, just like Ammon Bundy said.
[02:44:01.588 --> 02:44:03.349]  He grew up in those hills all of his life.
[02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:06.091]  He could not believe that it was turned into a
[02:44:07.191 --> 02:44:10.672]  That he had people, snipers, on the hills pointing guns at him.
[02:44:10.672 --> 02:44:12.593]  He couldn't believe that that would happen.
[02:44:12.593 --> 02:44:15.794]  You need to wake up and understand this is where it's going to go.
[02:44:15.794 --> 02:44:17.055]  For everyone.
[02:44:17.055 --> 02:44:20.696]  If we don't stand up collectively for individual rights.
[02:44:20.696 --> 02:44:24.137]  If we don't stand up collectively for the rule of law.
[02:44:24.137 --> 02:44:34.161]  When they take your rights, whether it's grazing rights, water rights, your rights to privacy, your right to keep and bear arms, they're going to take your First Amendment rights, your free speech rights, and they did that.
[02:44:34.921 --> 02:44:36.882]  They showed what they're about.
[02:44:36.882 --> 02:44:40.144]  They showed that they're about a dictatorship.
[02:44:40.144 --> 02:44:43.185]  They showed that this is martial law, even though they didn't clear it.
[02:44:43.185 --> 02:44:43.745]  Very disturbing.
[02:44:43.745 --> 02:44:47.767]  Heard a report from Sue in Idaho that she knew somebody who was there.
[02:44:47.767 --> 02:44:51.569]  If there's anybody else in Nevada that knows any more about this situation, please call in again.
[02:44:51.569 --> 02:44:52.250]  The number is...
[02:44:52.910 --> 02:44:53.070]  800-259-9231.
[02:44:53.070 --> 02:44:54.811]  Let's go to Noble Patriot in Oregon.
[02:44:54.811 --> 02:44:55.532]  Noble Patriot, go ahead.
[02:44:55.532 --> 02:44:55.852]  How you doing?
[02:44:55.852 --> 02:44:56.052]  Fine.
[02:44:56.052 --> 02:44:56.852]  What do you want to say?
[02:44:56.852 --> 02:44:59.854]  Yeah, I've made some comments on the InfoWars regarding the situation and was blocked.
[02:44:59.854 --> 02:45:02.676]  So how do you guys stand for the First Amendment if you don't stand for mine?
[02:45:19.811 --> 02:45:21.032]  Uh, what was, what was blocked?
[02:45:21.032 --> 02:45:21.633]  Go ahead and say it.
[02:45:21.633 --> 02:45:24.014]  We're not trying to censor anything.
[02:45:24.014 --> 02:45:26.596]  It might be something that, uh... I'm not trying to censor anything.
[02:45:26.596 --> 02:45:28.998]  I can't make no more comments on InfoWars.
[02:45:28.998 --> 02:45:29.758]  Well, what did you say?
[02:45:29.758 --> 02:45:32.500]  Did you use some, uh, language, or did you threaten to kill somebody?
[02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:33.001]  What was it?
[02:45:33.001 --> 02:45:33.681]  Well, go ahead and say it.
[02:45:33.681 --> 02:45:34.842]  We're not censoring you right now.
[02:45:34.842 --> 02:45:35.443]  Say it.
[02:45:35.443 --> 02:45:35.843]  Okay.
[02:45:35.843 --> 02:45:41.367]  Well, I said that the only way to take this country back is by force, and all you guys with your cardboard signs are wasting your time.
[02:45:43.362 --> 02:45:52.427]  Well, let me tell you what, when you get taken off when you call for actions of violence, and let me tell you something, we didn't have to shoot them to get our rights back.
[02:45:52.427 --> 02:45:55.668]  What it took was people standing up and facing them down.
[02:45:55.668 --> 02:45:56.309]  I was there.
[02:45:56.309 --> 02:46:01.592]  And you don't need to start taking cheap shots at us or cheap shots at the people who were there.
[02:46:02.412 --> 02:46:05.715]  There is a way that we can face this down and we can do it peacefully.
[02:46:05.715 --> 02:46:09.958]  You stare the people in the eye and you walk right up to them.
[02:46:09.958 --> 02:46:10.839]  That's what we did there.
[02:46:10.839 --> 02:46:11.720]  We did it in mass.
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:13.121]  We did it publicly.
[02:46:13.121 --> 02:46:14.982]  That's the way to stand these people down.
[02:46:14.982 --> 02:46:17.444]  You can stand up for your rights on a jury.
[02:46:17.444 --> 02:46:21.708]  You can stand against these unlawful orders that are given to you by a judge.
[02:46:21.708 --> 02:46:26.091]  You can stand against unlawful laws that are created by these out-of-control bureaucracies.
[02:46:26.091 --> 02:46:29.234]  There's a way to do this and one of the hopes that I have
[02:46:29.634 --> 02:46:38.261]  And one of the things that made me so optimistic, so excited, was to see that we could have taken back those cattle peacefully.
[02:46:38.261 --> 02:46:39.622]  We can take back our rights.
[02:46:39.622 --> 02:46:41.163]  We don't have to be cattle.
[02:46:41.163 --> 02:46:42.384]  We can take back the cattle.
[02:46:42.384 --> 02:46:45.366]  We can take this country back and we can do it.
[02:46:45.366 --> 02:46:47.668]  It takes resolve and it can be done peacefully.
[02:46:47.668 --> 02:46:49.629]  If they fire first, fine.
[02:46:49.629 --> 02:46:51.010]  We don't need to start shooting.
[02:46:51.010 --> 02:46:52.932]  It's not time to start shooting yet.
[02:46:52.932 --> 02:46:54.933]  Let's go to Diana in Oklahoma.
[02:46:54.933 --> 02:46:55.494]  Diana, go ahead.
[02:46:56.983 --> 02:47:08.030]  Hi, I'm a first-time caller and I've been listening to the InfoWars for a good half the amount of time you guys have been on the air and I find that you guys are doing a great job.
[02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:14.173]  But the reason why I wanted to call in was I was listening to a radio show called the Wilco Majority.
[02:47:14.173 --> 02:47:25.380]  Somebody called in talking about that there's an exact same situation going on in New Mexico, in the South Central part of New Mexico, BLM going in and taking somebody's cattle.
[02:47:25.820 --> 02:47:28.001]  I don't know if anybody else has talked about this.
[02:47:28.001 --> 02:47:36.506]  I don't know where this gentleman got his source, but I thought it would be worth letting somebody else know and passing the word along.
[02:47:36.506 --> 02:47:37.566]  Okay.
[02:47:37.566 --> 02:47:40.828]  Somewhere in New Mexico, do you have a city?
[02:47:40.828 --> 02:47:41.968]  South Central New Mexico?
[02:47:41.968 --> 02:47:43.509]  No, I don't.
[02:47:43.509 --> 02:47:49.152]  It was very limited on information and I just thought that
[02:47:50.538 --> 02:48:01.793]  If anybody else knows anything that's going on, it might be you guys or somebody else might be able to phone in and give some information about it, but I just thought that that was worth mentioning.
[02:48:01.793 --> 02:48:04.737]  But I also wanted to talk about your guys'...
[02:48:06.441 --> 02:48:12.122]  You, David Knight, thank you so much for being out there in Nevada and the whole thing is just blood boiling.
[02:48:12.122 --> 02:48:12.782]  No, no, no.
[02:48:12.782 --> 02:48:15.203]  Thank you for supporting the operation.
[02:48:15.203 --> 02:48:17.723]  Thank you for getting the word out.
[02:48:17.723 --> 02:48:19.404]  There were so many people that were there.
[02:48:19.404 --> 02:48:24.825]  A lot of them came up and said that they'd heard about it through InfoWars, through reporting here.
[02:48:24.825 --> 02:48:26.865]  Special thanks to the guy in the InfoWars t-shirt.
[02:48:26.865 --> 02:48:29.306]  They gave me some water after I'd been talking for a long time.
[02:48:30.106 --> 02:48:33.128]  We really appreciate the support of everybody, especially the prayers.
[02:48:33.128 --> 02:48:35.089]  I saw a lot of comments where people were praying for this.
[02:48:35.089 --> 02:48:41.672]  This was resolved peacefully, and just as I told the caller before, we need to stand these people down.
[02:48:41.672 --> 02:48:52.038]  We are in the right here, and we need to just understand what's going on, understand the scam that they're operating, and we will have the moral authority and the backbone to stand up to them.
[02:48:55.009 --> 02:48:56.650]  We have power in numbers.
[02:48:56.650 --> 02:48:56.930]  Yes.
[02:48:56.930 --> 02:49:00.912]  And I have been saying that for years and years and years.
[02:49:00.912 --> 02:49:08.356]  And for the longest time I was always looked at as some kind of person who has these wild dreams of something.
[02:49:08.356 --> 02:49:10.377]  But it's true.
[02:49:10.377 --> 02:49:14.338]  If we do not hang together, we assuredly hang separately.
[02:49:14.338 --> 02:49:14.859]  Absolutely.
[02:49:14.859 --> 02:49:16.459]  And that's the bottom line.
[02:49:16.459 --> 02:49:16.840]  Absolutely.
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:17.520]  Thank you so much.
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:19.541]  Now you're talking about this going on in New Mexico.
[02:49:19.541 --> 02:49:21.622]  I've got an article right here where it's going on in Texas.
[02:49:22.526 --> 02:49:23.386]  Red River Rumble.
[02:49:23.386 --> 02:49:27.328]  BLM wants to seize 90,000 acres of Texas ranchers' land.
[02:49:27.328 --> 02:49:31.590]  This is from a site called misguidedchildren.com.
[02:49:31.590 --> 02:49:32.750]  This is going on everywhere.
[02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:35.271]  The BLM is doing this everywhere.
[02:49:35.271 --> 02:49:43.214]  The guy who is there, even though he is a minion for Harry Reid, his father, however, has connections to the mineral industries.
[02:49:43.214 --> 02:49:45.135]  They are trying to loot this country.
[02:49:45.495 --> 02:49:47.395]  They're not trying to manage public lands.
[02:49:47.395 --> 02:49:50.336]  They're trying to turn them over to the corporate elite.
[02:49:50.336 --> 02:49:51.636]  To the Chinese.
[02:49:51.636 --> 02:49:52.996]  That's what's really going on.
[02:49:52.996 --> 02:49:53.777]  You need to wake up.
[02:49:53.777 --> 02:49:55.857]  This is part of Agenda 21.
[02:49:55.857 --> 02:49:57.717]  But there's a broader picture here.
[02:49:57.717 --> 02:50:00.718]  There's a broader picture that applies to things like Obamacare.
[02:50:00.718 --> 02:50:04.179]  There's a broader picture that applies to things like the income tax.
[02:50:04.179 --> 02:50:11.020]  You've got the IRS now saying that they're going to apply outstanding, what they assume to be outstanding, tax debts to children.
[02:50:12.227 --> 02:50:19.150]  They can go back decades and say, we think that your parents owed some tax, so we're now going to apply to you, even if we don't have the records.
[02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:21.471]  Things that are decades old.
[02:50:21.471 --> 02:50:26.553]  When you start letting them ignore the law, whether it's a statute of limitations or whatever it is...
[02:50:27.574 --> 02:50:28.554]  Katie, borrow the door.
[02:50:28.554 --> 02:50:29.455]  The gates are open.
[02:50:29.455 --> 02:50:41.019]  We need to stand up and say there is a law in this land and you swore allegiance to it and we're not going to have regulation and taxation without representation.
[02:50:41.019 --> 02:50:42.220]  That's what's going on.
[02:50:42.220 --> 02:50:45.541]  We're going to be right back with more of your calls about what's going on there.
[02:50:45.541 --> 02:50:50.503]  If anyone has any updates about the situation at the Bundy Ranch today, we heard a report that they're moving now.
[02:50:50.503 --> 02:50:51.484]  Please call us with that.
[02:50:51.484 --> 02:50:52.224]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:52.224 --> 02:50:52.264]  800-259-9231.
[02:51:01.132 --> 02:51:07.335]  Uncover a simple privacy loophole that can stop the NSA spying thugs in their tracks at PrivacyLockdown.com.
[02:51:07.335 --> 02:51:13.038]  The NSA has already shut down hundreds of sites and to truth be told they could shut down this operation at any time.
[02:51:13.038 --> 02:51:19.241]  See, the privacy loophole I'm about to show you allows you to make all your sensitive information disappear in the next 30 days or less.
[02:51:19.241 --> 02:51:28.146]  Go to PrivacyLockdown.com now to take your life off the grid and see the loophole in the NSA and FBI spying machine before they close the loophole forever.
[02:51:28.146 --> 02:51:29.346]  Go to PrivacyLockdown.com.
[02:51:30.461 --> 02:51:39.746]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:51:39.746 --> 02:51:40.546]  This capitalism?
[02:51:40.546 --> 02:51:46.710]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:50.412]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:51:50.412 --> 02:51:51.372]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:51:51.372 --> 02:51:52.413]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:51:52.413 --> 02:51:52.733]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:52.733 --> 02:51:53.073]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:52:00.237 --> 02:52:03.899]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:52:03.899 --> 02:52:07.721]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:52:07.721 --> 02:52:13.904]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:52:13.904 --> 02:52:24.130]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:52:24.130 --> 02:52:28.552]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 probiotic from Terraganix.
[02:52:28.772 --> 02:52:38.940]  Pro-EM1 probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.
[02:52:38.940 --> 02:52:50.449]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.
[02:52:50.649 --> 02:52:56.814]  Call Terragenics at 866-369-3678 or visit Terragenics.com.
[02:52:56.814 --> 02:52:59.977]  T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[02:52:59.977 --> 02:53:03.280]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:05.702]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:53:05.702 --> 02:53:14.249]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:53:14.249 --> 02:53:16.311]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[02:53:16.451 --> 02:53:30.439]  Pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:53:30.439 --> 02:53:38.023]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:53:38.423 --> 02:53:44.707]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:54:11.334 --> 02:54:14.036]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[02:54:14.036 --> 02:54:34.651]  We've been talking this entire show about the situation in Nevada at the Bundy Ranch, what the BLM is doing, what it tells us about the larger situation, about government agencies that are out of control, that can rewrite laws, that can take away all of our rights, that can act in martial law without declaring it in any given area.
[02:54:35.191 --> 02:54:39.734]  They can say that you no longer have free speech if you step outside your car we'll immediately arrest you.
[02:54:39.734 --> 02:54:41.475]  Is that the kind of America that we want to live in?
[02:54:41.475 --> 02:54:47.700]  Now I've seen people say that this is a PSYOP, that this whole thing that happened on Saturday was a PSYOP.
[02:54:47.700 --> 02:54:54.885]  I truly believe that the sheriff showing up and saying, that's it, we give up, you can go back on the land, that was a PSYOP.
[02:54:54.885 --> 02:54:58.287]  That was trying to get everybody to go home and say, oh that's fine, it's over.
[02:54:58.287 --> 02:55:04.212]  What was not a PSYOP, what they did not expect, what they did not engineer, was for us to all go over there
[02:55:05.012 --> 02:55:05.432]  We're good.
[02:55:24.266 --> 02:55:26.287]  This was not Tiananmen Square.
[02:55:26.287 --> 02:55:32.411]  It wasn't just that we had men on horses, it was that there were also people there with guns, and they would have used them if they had started shooting.
[02:55:32.411 --> 02:55:40.775]  It would have been a disaster, and it will be a disaster for the federal government if they use force in this situation.
[02:55:40.775 --> 02:55:42.456]  We need to start watching them like hawks.
[02:55:42.456 --> 02:55:43.637]  We're taking your calls.
[02:55:43.637 --> 02:55:45.118]  Let's go to Mark in California.
[02:55:45.118 --> 02:55:47.599]  Mark?
[02:55:47.599 --> 02:55:48.880]  Hey David, how you doing?
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:49.861]  Doing fine.
[02:55:49.861 --> 02:55:50.161]  What you got?
[02:55:50.609 --> 02:55:50.869]  Good.
[02:55:50.869 --> 02:55:57.533]  Hey, there's a lot of stuff floating around on Facebook right now that's real important for everybody that needs to pay attention to this.
[02:55:57.533 --> 02:56:01.115]  Now, I was down there at the ranch with you, David Knight, and your crew.
[02:56:01.115 --> 02:56:01.795]  Fantastic.
[02:56:01.795 --> 02:56:02.096]  Thank you.
[02:56:02.096 --> 02:56:03.256]  You guys did an awesome job.
[02:56:03.256 --> 02:56:05.057]  I want to say that right now.
[02:56:05.057 --> 02:56:06.398]  You guys got some glory.
[02:56:06.398 --> 02:56:09.620]  Well, thanks for going, but tell us what you're saying right now.
[02:56:10.871 --> 02:56:21.163]  Right now what they're trying to get out across the message to everybody right now is that don't trust anything that you're seeing on Facebook except for what is on their page.
[02:56:21.163 --> 02:56:22.645]  We support the bunny thing.
[02:56:22.645 --> 02:56:26.710]  Then also beware of roadblocks.
[02:56:27.532 --> 02:56:37.001]  And inspection points, that's what we're also gathering right now, that people are, they're concerned about people showing up that may be armed and they're trying to possibly stop them.
[02:56:37.001 --> 02:56:37.862]  Oh, really?
[02:56:37.862 --> 02:56:38.323]  Really.
[02:56:38.323 --> 02:56:40.625]  What are the carry, what are the carry laws there in Nevada?
[02:56:40.625 --> 02:56:44.108]  I thought they had open carry.
[02:56:44.108 --> 02:56:47.491]  Uh, yes, yes, but we're talking about California.
[02:56:47.491 --> 02:56:51.956]  Oh, okay, okay, okay, roadblocks in California, people that would be headed to that, I understand, okay.
[02:56:52.375 --> 02:56:53.116]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:56:53.116 --> 02:57:01.142]  There's a lot of people that are heading out to this thing and they're trying to stop people from even getting to the location in the first place to even support this thing.
[02:57:01.142 --> 02:57:04.825]  And the next thing is, is that people are spreading around on Facebook right now.
[02:57:04.825 --> 02:57:11.151]  They're talking about the fact that, you know, they're taking down everybody's license plate numbers, everybody that goes and supports this thing.
[02:57:11.151 --> 02:57:16.175]  They've got a team out that's, you know, basically documenting every single person that shows up.
[02:57:16.175 --> 02:57:19.718]  So now people are afraid to even go out there to support this thing.
[02:57:19.918 --> 02:57:23.401]  Let me address that, you know, because I saw that as well.
[02:57:23.401 --> 02:57:26.705]  Look, folks, if you haven't gotten the memo yet, you're being watched.
[02:57:26.705 --> 02:57:27.746]  You're being recorded.
[02:57:27.746 --> 02:57:30.629]  They know everything about you already.
[02:57:30.629 --> 02:57:32.670]  Don't be cowed down by that.
[02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:33.772]  Get in their face.
[02:57:33.772 --> 02:57:35.233]  That's what we did there.
[02:57:35.233 --> 02:57:36.554]  People stood up to the tyranny.
[02:57:37.535 --> 02:57:53.605]  If, you know, if that's the takeaway that we get from the Snowden documents, that we've got to watch ourselves, we've got to censor ourselves, we've got to shut any protest, anything that we do and say that would criticize the government, if that's the takeaway, we've lost.
[02:57:53.605 --> 02:57:55.267]  This country is lost.
[02:57:55.267 --> 02:57:58.188]  When they're doing the wrong thing, you have to stand up.
[02:57:58.188 --> 02:58:01.490]  And when they're watching you, that's all the more reason to stand up.
[02:58:01.490 --> 02:58:03.152]  Thank you so much, Mark in California.
[02:58:03.152 --> 02:58:05.053]  We've got a couple more callers I want to try to get to.
[02:58:05.053 --> 02:58:06.113]  Worth in North Carolina.
[02:58:06.113 --> 02:58:06.594]  Go ahead, Worth.
[02:58:07.322 --> 02:58:08.483]  Hey, David.
[02:58:08.483 --> 02:58:12.587]  Hey, I just wanted to commend you and Alex and the job you guys are doing.
[02:58:12.587 --> 02:58:14.228]  I'm here in North Carolina.
[02:58:14.228 --> 02:58:17.971]  I'll tell you, I've been glued to my computer all weekend.
[02:58:17.971 --> 02:58:19.672]  I'm wanting to go out there.
[02:58:19.672 --> 02:58:20.713]  Hang on a second.
[02:58:20.713 --> 02:58:22.435]  We're going to go into overdrive.
[02:58:22.435 --> 02:58:24.116]  We'll come right back to you.
[02:58:24.116 --> 02:58:25.798]  That's it for the Regularly Scheduled Show.
[02:58:25.798 --> 02:58:28.520]  We'll be back tonight on InfoWars Nightly News at 7 o'clock.
[02:58:28.780 --> 02:58:30.581]  Hang on for those of you who are watching on the internet.
[02:58:30.581 --> 02:58:31.642]  We'll be right back with Overdrive.
[02:58:31.642 --> 02:58:32.562]  We're going to go to these callers.
[02:58:32.562 --> 02:58:37.145]  We've got Worth in North Carolina, Richard in Oregon, Chad in California, Stacy in Wisconsin.
[02:58:37.145 --> 02:58:41.468]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:41.468 --> 02:58:42.869]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.098 --> 02:58:55.140]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:58:55.140 --> 02:58:59.483]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:58:59.483 --> 02:59:03.165]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:59:03.165 --> 02:59:06.187]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:59:06.187 --> 02:59:13.772]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:59:13.772 --> 02:59:17.414]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:59:17.614 --> 02:59:22.097]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:59:22.097 --> 02:59:28.062]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:59:28.062 --> 02:59:32.004]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:59:32.004 --> 02:59:34.746]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:59:34.746 --> 02:59:36.247]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:59:36.247 --> 02:59:37.628]  It's time to take action.
[02:59:37.628 --> 02:59:39.450]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:59:51.760 --> 02:59:53.301]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.301 --> 02:59:55.363]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.363 --> 02:59:58.566]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.799 --> 03:00:10.645]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.645 --> 03:00:12.227]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.227 --> 03:00:13.769]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.769 --> 03:00:17.974]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.974 --> 03:00:22.039]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.305 --> 03:00:24.727]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:24.727 --> 03:00:25.387]  I'm David Knight.
[03:00:25.387 --> 03:00:26.389]  We're in Overdrive.
[03:00:26.389 --> 03:00:32.355]  And we've been talking this entire show about the situation in Nevada at the Bundy Ranch.
[03:00:32.355 --> 03:00:35.459]  This is about a lot more than just one story.
[03:00:35.459 --> 03:00:39.303]  If you can understand the broad principles involved, that's what's really important.
[03:00:39.303 --> 03:00:40.304]  It's about a government.
[03:00:40.925 --> 03:00:45.309]  That is, regulating businesses out of existence without any representation.
[03:00:45.309 --> 03:00:49.333]  Have you ever voted for any BLM officials on your ballots?
[03:00:49.333 --> 03:00:51.955]  Have you ever voted for any IRS officials on your ballots?
[03:00:51.955 --> 03:00:55.939]  How about the EPA, or the Fish and Wildlife, or OSHA?
[03:00:55.939 --> 03:00:57.580]  Do they ever answer to us?
[03:00:57.580 --> 03:01:00.223]  No, this is regulation without representation.
[03:01:00.223 --> 03:01:02.044]  It is taxation without representation.
[03:01:02.930 --> 03:01:11.758]  The legislature, the Congress, has abdicated their authority and given it to these bureaucracies.
[03:01:11.758 --> 03:01:19.644]  They're allowing them to write the laws, to enforce the laws in a way where we don't have a presumption of innocence, where it's a military
[03:01:20.405 --> 03:01:22.046]  Martial law situation.
[03:01:22.046 --> 03:01:24.407]  They've allowed them to do this.
[03:01:24.407 --> 03:01:26.388]  We cannot allow this to continue.
[03:01:26.388 --> 03:01:29.250]  We cannot allow them to continually encroach upon our rights.
[03:01:29.250 --> 03:01:36.853]  And also, the story that we see here at the Bundy Ranch is that we can stand up to them en masse and we can take back our individual rights.
[03:01:36.853 --> 03:01:39.755]  Now, we were talking to callers who had just called in.
[03:01:39.755 --> 03:01:41.436]  We had Worth from North Carolina on the line.
[03:01:41.436 --> 03:01:43.457]  We had to cut for the end of the show.
[03:01:43.457 --> 03:01:44.337]  Worth, go ahead.
[03:01:44.337 --> 03:01:45.658]  Get right to what you wanted to say.
[03:01:46.556 --> 03:01:57.340]  Oh, I just wanted to say, if God could have picked anybody in the world, and this was the last man standing, Cliven Bundy, man, I mean, he couldn't have been a better person because he's so moral.
[03:01:57.340 --> 03:02:09.325]  And all these, watching those hundred cowboys lined up on horses with a thousand people behind them, and they had guns, and they didn't shoot nobody because they were taking the moral ground, and I just loved it.
[03:02:09.325 --> 03:02:12.266]  It was like watching the best Western movie I've ever seen in my life.
[03:02:12.691 --> 03:02:15.012]  It brought tears to my eyes when I saw it.
[03:02:15.012 --> 03:02:21.315]  It was right after the sheriff gave his PR ploy there from the BLM.
[03:02:21.315 --> 03:02:25.918]  And they had a whole bunch of mounted cowboys right in from either side.
[03:02:25.918 --> 03:02:28.759]  And one went straight up the hill, planted the flag.
[03:02:28.759 --> 03:02:29.399]  It was great.
[03:02:29.399 --> 03:02:34.402]  And these guys stood them down without using weapons, as you pointed out.
[03:02:34.402 --> 03:02:35.522]  That's the way we need to do it.
[03:02:35.522 --> 03:02:37.023]  We can do it if we stand together.
[03:02:37.023 --> 03:02:38.364]  Let's go to Richard in Oregon.
[03:02:38.364 --> 03:02:38.944]  Richard, go ahead.
[03:02:40.495 --> 03:02:48.065]  Yeah, I think, and yes, I'm glad you were out there and got people organized.
[03:02:48.065 --> 03:02:48.986]  That's the way to do it.
[03:02:48.986 --> 03:02:55.854]  It not has to be violence, but you have to have everybody stand up, united, in force.
[03:02:55.854 --> 03:02:56.695]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:02:57.577 --> 03:03:06.024]  And they backed down and they were very much afraid of, even though people were not pointing weapons at them, they were very much afraid.
[03:03:06.024 --> 03:03:18.194]  I genuinely do believe that they were trying a feint, that they were trying to deceive people with the announcement that the sheriff came up there, but they were not expecting the crowd of people to go down and confront them at those barricades.
[03:03:18.194 --> 03:03:24.299]  And even though they were fully armed, armored, and hiding behind their cars, they were very much afraid of the crowd.
[03:03:24.299 --> 03:03:25.880]  That was a very empowering moment.
[03:03:26.681 --> 03:03:29.223]  Need to understand that we can walk this down.
[03:03:29.223 --> 03:03:31.284]  We have to know what they're doing.
[03:03:31.284 --> 03:03:33.665]  We have to know that we're in the right.
[03:03:33.665 --> 03:03:34.186]  Go ahead.
[03:03:34.186 --> 03:03:36.067]  Was there anything else you wanted to say, Richard Norgan?
[03:03:36.067 --> 03:03:41.090]  Yeah, and the thing you have to be careful of is, it's like Guy's saying, this could be just a trick.
[03:03:41.090 --> 03:03:45.373]  Okay, to deescalate, get you relaxed, then they try another action.
[03:03:45.373 --> 03:03:47.114]  Especially you got to watch that with like,
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:51.383]  That's also like a very common Chinese tactic.
[03:03:51.383 --> 03:03:53.164]  I mean like years ago, they built these.
[03:03:53.164 --> 03:03:53.965]  Absolutely.
[03:03:53.965 --> 03:03:58.428]  I'm going to cut you short because I want to get to Chad in California and Stacey in Wisconsin.
[03:03:58.428 --> 03:04:01.711]  We understand it was it was simply a battle, but there was a victory.
[03:04:01.711 --> 03:04:03.852]  We need to be excited about that.
[03:04:03.852 --> 03:04:06.674]  Go ahead, Chad in California.
[03:04:06.674 --> 03:04:12.539]  Hey, yeah, he was incredible and a really good road mile in the sense that
[03:04:13.464 --> 03:04:15.286]  He carried on the statement before.
[03:04:15.286 --> 03:04:17.547]  He just didn't say, okay, I'm complying.
[03:04:17.547 --> 03:04:18.949]  You need to comply.
[03:04:18.949 --> 03:04:20.410]  He gave demands back.
[03:04:20.410 --> 03:04:26.355]  And it's the same thing that we need to do with, uh, example with the police.
[03:04:26.355 --> 03:04:32.120]  If you get involved with the police and they stop you, everybody's heard the fact that am I being detained officer?
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:33.281]  Why do we stop there?
[03:04:33.761 --> 03:04:38.685]  We have to actually confront these people and make them give good reason.
[03:04:38.685 --> 03:04:40.486]  Officer, am I being detained?
[03:04:40.486 --> 03:04:42.147]  I need a yes or a no.
[03:04:42.147 --> 03:04:46.350]  If you answer any other way, I'm going to assume that I'm not being detained and I'm on my way.
[03:04:46.350 --> 03:04:47.831]  You know, we're out of time.
[03:04:47.831 --> 03:04:50.873]  I'm sorry, Stacy in Wisconsin, we're not going to be able to get to you.
[03:04:50.873 --> 03:04:53.635]  Call back tomorrow, we'll try to take you.
[03:04:53.635 --> 03:04:56.196]  He did not have the attitude of a slave.
[03:04:56.196 --> 03:04:59.859]  He gave them orders based on what their duties were.
[03:04:59.859 --> 03:05:01.020]  That's the attitude we need to have.
